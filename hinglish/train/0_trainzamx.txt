 In the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) investigative journalism-related program 'four Corners', yesterday, a Chinese server illegally blocked the information that was attached to the new security headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) in Canberra

 bharat kaa doosraa sabase bada shahar hyderabad bina kisi shaq-shubahe ke sex ke maamle main desh kaa sarvaadhik sakriy shahar he
 This was confirmed in a 2008 India today-ac nielsen-org-marg sex survey
 sex ke saath prayog or in maamalon main yah shahar sabase aage he- sabase adhik avaidh sambandh, wif sweaping (patniyon kii adla-badali), veshyaaon ke saath yon sambandh, samalangikta ko sweekruti or samaaj main isaki vyapaktaa, sex toy (yon khilaunon kaa prayog), kam umr main sex sambandh, role plaing, sahavaas ke samay alag-alag mudraaen, video pornography or apana hi porn video bananaa
 Hyderabad's sexuality is also described in books like Sexuality with Respect to Sex and Asian Homosexuality
 kaamuktha kaa aagamannizaam ke shashan (1724-1948) ke dauraan hyderabad sampann shahar tha
 Sex was very much enjoyed during that period
 bahuvivaah, vaikalpik kaamuktha ko, jisamen samalingi sambandh or bacchon kaa yon shoshan bhi shaamil the, saamaanya mana jaataa tha
 Eunuchs were always there to protect the women of the harem, they used to accompany them in homosexual sexual games
 purv nizaam ke beton ke rahamaan naam ke ek khubasurat hijde ke prem main apane bhai ko chura bhonkane ke pramaan bhi milte hai
 The arrival of other people in Hyderabad also marked the arrival of sexuality associated with feudal and devadasi
 to hairat kii baat nahin ki bahut se hyderaabadi purush veshyaaon ke sangrakshak bane rahete hai, patniyon kii adla-badali main hissaa lete hai or avaidh sambandh banaate hai
 The wealth of the most HIV / aids-afflicted patients in the city has also attracted far-flung people, many of them willing to sip on the colorful fijas here, whether married or single
 shahar ke sahishnu or varjanahin samaaj ne is shahar ko 'algebiti' (lesbian, ge, bisexual or transsexuel) kii pasandida manzil bana diya he
 But the disturbing aspect of all this is that Andhra Pradesh has the highest number of HIV / AIDS patients in the country
 chintaa kii duusari baat yah he ki haal hi main samalangikta se sambandhit yon aparaadhon or hatyaon main vruddhi hui he
 The center of alternative sex 'LGBT' is present everywhere in the city
 yaa chat group, ge hyderabad inamen top ten main hai
 There are gay groups like Gay Bar, Mitrudu here
 or ham ashok ro kavi, hoshang marchent se to parichit hai hi, jinhone yaaranah ge riting from india or duusari pustaken likhi hai
 Hyderabad tops the list of homosexuals, so its real reason is to be tolerant in terms of sex
 main to kanga ki yah 'viksit' hua he
 It is probably the most tolerant of Indian cities
 ham purushon ko haathon main haath daale dekh sakate hai or kisi ko aashcharya nahin hota
 The same applies to female homosexuals
 bhartiya kanoon samalangikta virodhiek vajah or bhi he
 Californian law is also gay-leaning
 misaal ke taur par, saan francisco main america ke duusare shaharon kii tulana main adhik samalangik hai
 Indian law, by contrast, has anti-homosexuality, and homosexuals face social boycott
 kisi kanoonee sweekruti ke abhaav main saamaajik manyata bhi baadhak ban jaati he
 So it can be said that at a time when a campaign to establish identity of alternative sexuality is going on, Hyderabad is the 'LGBT' headquarters of the nation
 lekhak sex ij note e four letters verde ke lekhak, andrologist or yon dawaaon ke visheshgy hai

 Birju Maharaj said that even though 'item songs' have replaced the classical dances in cinema, old songs and dances on them are still considered iron
 unhone kaha, wahidaa rahamaan ko ‘guide’ main yaa minaa kumari ko ‘pakija’ main koun bhul saktaa he
 Where do you find Kathak or any other classical dance in cinema? yahi vajah he ki log aaj bhi puraane geeton ko yaad karte hai
 i like Madhuri also because she has maintained the tradition of classical dance
 ‘devdas’ kaa ‘kaahe ched mohe’ ho yaa ‘dil to pagal he’ kaa dance sikvence
 He has danced well
 cinema main nrity nirdesan main ruchi kam hone ke bare main unhone kaha, aajkal videshi nrityon kii kapi ho rahi he

 Birju Maharaj said, Madhuri has no need to fear
 vah behtareen nrutyaangna he
 Seeing him miss Waheeda Rehman and Meena Kumari
 uske nrity main itani garima he
 If i say that any dancer equivalent to Waheeda Rehman has been in Bollywood, then she is just Madhuri, then it will not be wrong
 tippaniyan Talking about my experience with Madhuri, he said, for the first time in 1997, i worked with Madhuri and even today when i direct her, she has the same urge to learn
 vah jeniyas he or bahut jaldi sikhti he
 The expressions on his face come very easily
 birju maharaj ne kaha ki cinema main shastreey nrityon kii jagah bhale hi ‘item geeton’ ne le lee he, lekin puraane gaanon or un par nrity kaa aaj bhi log loha maanate hai
 He said, who can forget Waheeda Rehman in 'guide' or Meena Kumari in 'pakija'
 ab cinema main kathak yaa koi anya shastreey nrity kahaan dekhne ko miltaa he
 This is the reason why people still remember old songs
 maadhuri mujhe isliye bhi pasand he ki shastreey nrity kii parampara usne kaayam rakhi he
 Dance sequence of 'kahe Chhe Mohe' from 'devdas' or 'dil To Pagal Hai'

 Talking about the lack of interest in dance direction in cinema, he said, "foreign dances are being copied nowadays
" yah wo nahin he jo main dekhnaa chahta hum
 Talking about her dance with Madhuri in Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, she said that it is based on Kathak

 Basically it is Jugalbandi, which the audience will like

 jab 23 varshiya majijia bhanu is saal kii shuruyaat main kochi main mistar kerala pratiyogita kemhilavarg main pratispardhaa karne ke liye manch par utrin, to sabhi kii nigahen un par thithak gayi, kyonki isse pehle logon ne kisi bodyilder kohijab(muslim mahilaon dwaara sar dhakne vaala scorf) pahanakar pratiyogita main bhaag lete nahin dekha tha
 She proved that the hijab was not an obstacle for her or any other woman and she went on to win the competition
 bhanu kaa maananaa he ki hijaab kabhi bhi apane lakshya ke prati samarpit kisi bhi jununee mahila ke liye baadha nahin he or agar koi mahila apane sharir ko dikhaane ke liye swatantra he, to use ise dhakne ke liye bhi swatantra hona chahie
 Since Bhanu is not the only Muslim woman in the world of arm-wrestling and powerlifting, she still has to see another woman in the region who participates wearing a hijab
 bhanu ne kaha, unke naamon kii ghoshnaa hone ke baad hi yah pataa chalata he ki pratibhaagi ek muslim he
 He said, i feel proud to wear hijab, which is part of my identity
 yah mujhe kisi bhi tarah se roktaa nahin he, balki mujhe garima or takat detaa he
 It took Bhanu just two years to become a local celebrity from an ordinary dental student
 vah na sirf apane gaanv main, balki kerala bhar main mashhoor hai
 She has been voted thrice as the most powerful woman in the state by the Kerala State Powerlifting Association
 apana kariyar shuru karne ke do saalon main, unhone pehle hi powerlifting or arm-raceling main rashtriya padak jeet liye, jabaki unhone dental training ko bhi jari rakhaa or chaahe abhyaas ho, yaa koi pratiyogita, vah hameshaa hijaab pahenti hai
 In the early days, Bhanu told IANS, men used to stare at me wearing a hijab
 lekin, jald hi unhen ahsaas hua ki main unki tarah abhyaas ko lekar gambhir hum
 Then everyone stopped staring
 chunki hameshaa se unhen khel main ruchi rahi he, unke gaanv main shaayad hi koi suvidha uplabdh thi
 But this did not stop him
 dental class ke baad vah har roj dangal ke liye 60 kilometre dur kosicode kii yatra train se kiya karti thim
 The final year dental student said, "I used to come back around 9 o'clock at night
" shuru main, yah sab mushkil tha
 But, gradually i gained confidence to travel alone and eventually it became a part of my daily routine
 bhanu ne kaha ki mata-pita ke samarthan ke bina vah apane lakshya ko hasil nahin kar paatin
 He said, i am from a very conservative village and my parents agreed to fulfill my passion for bodybuilding
 aaj, bhanu apane gaanv main kai anya ladakiyon ke liye ek prerana hai
 Following their success, the village now has its own gym
 unhone kaha, kai yuva ladakiyon or mahilaon ne mujhase salaah lene ke liye aana shuru kar diya he ki unhen kya karne kii jarurat he, kyonki main jo kar rahi hum, ve bhi karnaa chaahati hai
 Now there is a gym in my village
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ab vah maheene main keval teen-chaar baar kosicode jaati hai
 Bhanu is making tremendous preparations to participate in the World Arm Wrestling Championship-2018 to be held in Turkey next month, due to which he is very busy nowadays
 bhanu ne kaha, main nahin jaanati thi ki main aisa kar sakuungi, kyonki yatra ke liye fund kii jarurat thi
 i knocked on some doors and finally managed to manage
 kuch shubhachintakon ne meri yatra ko pryojit kiya he
 Sometimes, when i find a sponsor, i realize that nobody wants to sponsor me, because i am a Muslim woman
 bhavishya kii yojanaon ke bare main bhanu ne kaha ki unka pehla lakshya apni padhai puri karnaa he, kyonki unke mata-pita kaa sapana unhen doctor banane kaa he
 Bhanu said with confidence, once i complete it, i will try to fulfill my dream of setting up an academy which will be multi-disciplinary including martial arts, powerlifting, arm-wrestling and bodybuilding
 isamen ladakiyon ko ahmiyat di jaaegi
 She said with confidence, i am very sure that i will be able to fulfill my passion and fulfill my desire to empower women

 But our Prime Minister is sharing his information without hesitation in an election rally
 wing commander abhinandan ko apana celut, sandesh yahaan post karenapako bataa den ki jab abhinandan ko pakistani sena ne apni hiraasat main liya or unase sawaal poochne shuru kiye to unhone kuch hi jawaab die

 Ambati Rayudu's comical run-out https: / / t

 Degree
 magar naukari nahin
 'india Today Conclave 2015 churned on this important question of today's India
 sawaalh kya he ye skildevelopmentmantralay?rudiah100 din pehle hi bana he ye mantralay
 66 years behind
 kyon bana ye mantralay
 Because 24 ministers from the last two sessions were answering questions related to skill development
 isliye chizon ko vyavasthit kiya gaya
 Question: What will be your role in bringing good days as promised by Modi? Rudy: In developed countries or even in countries like China, the skilled work force is above 40%
 magar bharat main yah number he 2 fisadi
 Therefore, it is not difficult unemployment, but to prepare people properly for difficult employment
 isliye aisi shiksha par jor he, jo logon main rojgaar ke liye jaruri skill develop kare
 And this is where our role begins
 sirf bhoomika hi nahin, sabase zyada focus kii bhi jarurat he
 Question: Mr
 Chetan Bhagat, where is the problem? Chetan Bhagat: Hardly not just at the level of the government
 do chijen hai
 One, whatever the government should do
 skill development kar le
 Foreign companies should come
 1 karod naukari nahin paidaa ho sakati hai
 The need for entrepreneurship
 marwari or gujarati jaise kuchhek udhaaharan chhod den, to baaki bharat kii soch acchhee naukari lo, saital ho jaao vaali he
 The need is for mini entrepreneurship at an early stage
 duusari baat, logon ko is sawaal kaa jawaab bhi dena hoga ki kya vah aisi sarkaar kii saraahna karenge jo vot bank ke liye twarit or popular faisle lene ke bajaay vijanary or lambey samay tak asar or nattejey dene vaale faisle kare
 Conclave15: Why does Sachin regret it? Question: Is admission in big educational institutions a guarantee of success
 khaastaur par aarthik rup se pichde varg ke liye?anand kumarasb english main bol rahe hai
 i will speak in my language, in Hindi
 dil kii baat kah paaungaa
 IIT is a dream
 bharat ke sudur ilaakon main jahaan zyada maukey nahin hai
 Parents think of doctors, engineers and even more civil servants
 ejeeniyar ke liye sabase bada mandir iaiti he
 Even though iits do not figure in the top 200 tech institutes of the world
 bhale hi ye manjul bhargav sa ganitagya paidaa na kar paae
 But it is the best and comparative cheaper option in India
 iaiti main padhane se maukey zyada milte hai
 The rest of the government is doing it
 rudismain bhi bihar se hum or anand ji bhi
 100 million people live in Bihar
 main ek airlines main captain hum
 There 100 girls come as airhostesses
 sab 10 yaa 12veen padhi hai
 Only those who have studied in good convent schools get such jobs
 unako angreji kii ahmiyat bahut samaj aati he
 English is very important in the service sector
 bihar main isaki sambhaavna bahut kam he
 There is a denial on behalf of society
 isse yuvaaon ke maukey kam ho jate hai
 Anand Kumar: Honorable Minister is speaking well
 bade bhai hai
 When you talk about teaching English in school
 to koun se skool dhyaan main aate hai
 Such expensive schools
 gaanv ke skool main to master hi nahin pahunch rahaa
 Who will learn English there
 rudicamera sirf yah kahana he ki yuvaaon ke liye bhashaa baadha ke rup main nahin aani chahie
 IT conclave Shuruswal with Arun Puri's speech: Now let's talk about higher education
 manjul bhargav, aap modi sarkaar kii is silsile main bani ek cameti main bhi hai
 What kind of reforms are needed? Manjul Bhargava: The need is to call scholars from all over the world to India
 aisa maahaul taiyaar karne kii he
 They will come here
 students se baat karenge
 Videos of his talk will be shown in universities across the country
 isamen nai tarah kii research, jo har kshetra main ho rahi he, uske bare main baat kii jaaegi
 With this, the problems of India and the necessary research on them will be talked about
 isse yuvaaon kii soch badalegi
 Question: Will this stop the talent from going out? Manjul Bhargava: It is true that renowned foreign institutes for research are miles ahead of us
 jo vahaan ja sakate hai, jaaen
 But our effort is to create similar facilities and environment in the country
 mere paas bharat se rojaanaa hajaaron email aa rahe hai
 The committee has been formed, but people have started showing immense enthusiasm in such initiatives
 hamen is par khara utarana hoga
 Question: The Minister has been repeatedly saying that in 66 years skill development has not been taken care of
 sirf degree par focus rahaa
 Is there a mindset somewhere? degree mil jaae
 Should i bcom and be unemployed or do a plumbing course and get work? Chetan Bhagat: Yes, the question of mindset is there
 hamane naukariyon kaa jati vibhaajan kar diya he
 Plumbing is a lower job
 mej par kagaji kaam karnaa acha
 In Europe, students from many affluent families drive part time
 apni pocket mani kamaane ke liye
 But is it possible here? log kahenge, are tumhaara betaa driver he
 Rudy: Metromonial add
 ladkaa kam se kam bie paas ho
 The day the poster will show that the boy is a plumber, a fitter
 bas uskaa vetan acha ho
 Then the change will be true
 jarurat skulon ke str par hi skill development shuru karne kii he
 This is a big challenge
 sawaalh anand kumaar, mind set par aap kya sochate hai?anand kumarapahale driver kaa betaa sochataa tha ki meraa betaa bhi bada hokar bas meri jagah driver lag jaae
 But now he thinks that no matter how hard i have to work, but my son should be bigger than my honor
 magar sarkaar kya kar rahi he
 What did the government create for iits
 do hi baar paper de saktaa he
 It was a matter of improving opportunities for big cities and big schools
 gaanv main to log iaiti or itiai kaa fark samajhane main hi vakt lagaate hai
 Need to get a chance
 plumber tak kyon simit rakhte hai
 a child sitting on a buffalo can become an engineer or mathematician
 sawaalh ye aryabhatta, bhaskar jaison kaa desh tha
 But in today's generation, no one wants to do maths
 bachche pyor science se dur kyon bhaag rahe hai
 Where is it? Manjul: Yes, most of the children are not showing interest
 magar jo ruchi rakhte bhi hai, unhen bhi nahin pataa ki aage isamen kaise raah khojani he
 We have to think and explain that those who do pure science also get respect
 apni jindagi achche se chalaate hai
 This is the issue of Mindset
 maukon kaa masalaa utana ahm nahin he
 Because now there are many opportunities for talented young scientists
 to ye soch galat he ki science yaa maths acchhee karo taaki iaiti yaa piemti nikaal sako
 If good students are not coming this way, then it is affecting the faculty
 kai jagah science ke shikshakon kii kami he
 Question: In education, even in skill, English is most important
 chetan bhagatahmain chetan bhagat nahin ban paata, agar mujhe hindi nahin aati
 Look hindi ko political ishu banane kii jarurat he
 Hindi is your mother
 english ij yor wif
 You have to love both
 ab ye mat poochna ki kise zyada pyaar karte ho
 Anand Kumar: We do not say do not learn English
 hamaare bihar ke bachche aaj landan or america main kaam kar rahe hai
 The need is to free them from the inferiority complex that if you do not know English, nothing comes
 magar chetan bhai
 One who does not know English should not be cut off from the mainstream
 skill kii baat karun to jila level par training honi chahie
 If then change condition in five years
 akhbaar main shaadi ke aid aise aaenmanjultohar kisi ko ejeeniyar bananaa hi kyon he
 Build schools where full education is imparted
 science, arts
 And then some specialist schools
 jahaan khaas tarah ke skill, subject padhaaye jaaen
 And there is a great need for mutual dialogue between all the different regions

 Among the Indian players of the nineties, most 16 to 16 except Mohammad Azharuddin, Robin Singh and Ajay Jadeja
 5 kaa score banaate the
 But now the situation is different and the captain himself is setting the criteria

 If the line is not reached on time, then two more 'beeps' have to catch pace
 agar khilaadi do chhoron par teji hasil nahin kar paata he to pareekshan roak diya jaataa he
 The entire process is based on software, in which the results are recorded

 rajdhani dilli ke pradhanmantri nivas main 17 agast ko desh ke zyaadaatar aarthik niti-niyantaa jute hue the
 The atmosphere was serious
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha, bharat 'bahut hi mushkil halaat se guzar rahaa he
 'this is how the report titled' India in Troubler: the reckoning 'begins on 24 August 2013 in The Economist magazine
 report bharat ke sankat kii daraavnee tasviir pesh karti he
 For two years, the economy was in dismal news, the growth rate had fallen to 4-5 per cent, inflation in consumer products was stagnant at 10 per cent, the current account deficit at the end of 2012 was around 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP)
 Per cent and the deficit was estimated to be 4-5 per cent in 2013-14
 rupye kii keemat nichle str ko chhu gai thi or mahaj teen maheene pehle ke mukaable 13 fisadi gir gai thi
 The report ended with the message that "the opinion on a large scale is that the country is stuck in the worst economic crisis since 1991"
 ''uske kareeb do saal or maujuuda sarkaar ke saal bhar baad aaj ham kahaan khadey hai?varsh 2014-15 main arthvyavastha 7
 It is registering a growth rate of 4 per cent, inflation at 5 per cent, the current account deficit has come down to 1 per cent of GDP and the rupee remains stable against the dollar
 jo arthvyavastha 'sankat main' thi, aaj use vishwa bank or antarrashtriya mudra kosh jaisi sansthaaen duniya kii sabase majboot arthvyavastha bataa rahi hai
 How was this change possible? Some people are of the opinion that India's fate was awakened by the sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and other consumer goods in the international market
 lekin is raay main do dikkatein hai
 One, the world economy is yet to recover from the recession
 usamen vah teji nahin he, jo pehle hua karti thi
 The number four largest market in the world, the European Union is on the verge of disaster due to Greece's crisis
 duusare, or sabase ahm yah he ki keemton main giravat kaa laabh sabhi deshon ko mila
 But which country has managed to overcome the brink of crisis by a faster growth rate, lower inflation rate, huge rise in current account and stabilizing its currency? Therefore, a more satisfactory answer is that this change is possible by restoring confidence in the economy
 And this confidence has arisen due to some concrete steps
 sarkaar ke shuruaati kadamon main teen kii khaas charchaa kii ja sakati he
 One, the new government immediately took over the decision-making process of paralysis by getting stuck in the pangs of the Ministry of Environment as soon as the throne took over
 duusare, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne afasarshahi se vyaktigat sampark kaayam kiya or use harakat main aane ke liye prerit kiya
 In the end he assured that the decisions of the central government should not be stalled due to lack of coordination between the various ministries
 haal hi main bricks deshon ke new deveopment bank ke mukhiya bane ke
 V
 kamath kehete hai ki aaj dilli main maamalon ke latake rahane kii shikaayat kam hi log karte hai, jo pichhali sarkaar ke dauraan aam baat thi
 These initial steps became more effective due to the financial discipline of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 mahangaai ke kaabo main aane ke baad saamaanya jidipi main to mandi dikhi lekin vaastavik jidipi main vruddhi dar main teji ai
 This meant that growth in government revenue declined
 iske saath hi infrastracchar par sarkari kharch badhaane kii behad jarurat he or pradhanmantri kii saamaajik kshetra par kharch kii kadi patibaddhta he
 To add to this, if the revenue share of the states was increased by 10 percentage points and the finance minister had to strike a very delicate balance, then the finance minister should be credited that he did not allow financial discipline to be relaxed
 purvavarti sarkaar ke raaj main bhrashtachar or ghotaalon kii intiha ho gai thi lekin is sarkaar main aisi ek bhi ghatana saamne nahin ai he
 2 lakh crore from auction of coal blocks and spectrum
 ugaahe gaye lekin kisi ne bhi kisi ghapale kii shikaayat nahin kii
 The government's strategy has been double-edged in a big way to boost agriculture and production sector
 vruddhi dar, vikaas, tankchavaah or rojgaar main teji laane ke liye krishi or utpaadan kshetra main praathamikta ke str par teji laane kii koshish kii gai
 In order to provide direct relief to the poor and the needy, all social programs were started and some new schemes were also introduced
 madhyam or dderghaavadhik yojanaon ke mad main 2022 tak sabhi deshavaasiyon ke liye awaas, bijli, svachh peyajal, shauchalay, swasthya suvidhaayen, shiksha or hunar muhaiyaa karaane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 i would like to detail every aspect
 krishi kshetra main sarkaar ne sarkari kharch kaa prabandhan is tarah kiya ki pani ke kam istemaal se adhik paidaavaar hasil ho
 In this direction, comprehensive means of irrigation, soil cards, better seeds and related programs were increased
 purvi rajyon main harith kranti laane kii yojana bhi chal rahi he
 The Make in India campaign became the basis of many policies and programs to accelerate the production sector and generate employment
 in nitiyon or kaaryakramon kii choti fehrist bhi kaaphi prabhaavshaalee he
 First, over the years, many economists have been writing that the old labor laws remain a major bottleneck in the creation of good employment in the production sector
 hamane ab jaakar is mushkil kshetra main sudhaar kii sambhaavna dekhi he
 States like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have taken steps to reform the old labor laws of the country, indicating the Centre's desire to change the law of the subjects of the concurrent list
 centre main bhi inamen se kuch kanoonon main sudhaar kiya gaya he or ab in sabhi 44 kanoonon ko mahaj paanch kanoon main badalane kii taiyaari he
 Secondly, to help small and medium scale industries, the government has launched the Shram Suvidha Portal, which provides them with a single window to enable themselves to comply with 16 central labor laws
 kendriya adhikari inkaa nirikshan sirf computer janit betaratib namoona chayan ke jariye hi kar sakate hai
 In this way he has been freed from Inspector Raj harassing companies
 tisare, kutir, laghu or majhole upakramon kii aksar hunarmand kamgaaron kii kami kii shikaayat hoti he
 In view of this, the Prime Minister has pledged to build an army of skilled people on a war footing
 yahi nahin, ek alag mantralay hi bana diya gaya he
 Four are in need of land for building infrastructure, housing and new cities
 2013 kaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kisaanon ke haq main kaaphi had tak badha hua kadam tha kyonki iske pehle unki jameen coditon ke bhav le lee jaati thi
 But this law also created difficulties in land acquisition
 maujuuda sarkaar ne iskaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii koshish kii
 Through an ordinance, it made arrangements to pay more compensation to farmers for the acquisition of land under the 2013 law for the purpose of highway construction, etc
 while rationalizing the acquisition process for other public interest projects
 paanchvaan, kaarobaar ke liye maahaul ko aasaan banane kii khatir audyogic niti or protsaahan vibhaag centre or rajya sarkaron donon ke saath milakar kaam kar rahaa he
 States are joining it enthusiastically
 chatha, haal ke bajet main vitt mantri ne nivesh ko adhik kargar banane or anischitataaon ko dur karne ke liye bade sudhaaron kaa prastaav kiya he
 There are proposals to rationalize the Goods and Services Tax system, modern insolvency law, revised company profits tax and rules in various infrastructure sectors
 saatvaan, infrastracchar kshetra main saarvajanik nivesh main ijapha, 100 smart city or audyogic coridor nirmaan ke prati patibaddhta or infrastracchar kshetra main nijee nivesh ko protsaahan jaise kadam 'mek in india' abhiyaan main madad karenge
 Apart from this, our very enthusiastic Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has promised to open new avenues for the modernization of the railways with the increase in production
 ant main, pradhanmantri ke duniya ke anek ahm deshon ke safal dauron kii badaulat bharat phir vishwa manch par ubharate bazaar ke rup main sthapit ho gaya he, jise kabhi bejaan maan liya gaya tha
 This image will be further strengthened by FDI in defense, railways and insurance sectors
 'mek in india' kaa matlab sirf bharat main utpaadan hi nahin he
 It is also a means of generating employment and alleviating poverty
 iske alaava tej vruddhi se sarkari rajasav main bhi badhotaree hogi jisase saamaajik kaaryakramon main bhi ijapha kiya ja sakegaa
 This increase in revenue in the medium to long term will help to meet basic needs like housing, electricity, clean drinking water, toilets, roads, health and education and building a team of skilled youth and all on the 75th anniversary of independence in 2022 Government's goal of providing basic amenities to the countrymen will be fulfilled
 majboot saamaajik suraksha tantravarsh 2015-16 main rajasav main saamaanya badhotaree se bhi sarkaar do madon main saamaajik suraksha tantra ko majboot karne kii disha main aage badi he
 One, all existing plans and programs have been maintained and some new important schemes have also been introduced
 svachh bharat or beemaa yojana iske do udhaaharan hai
 Secondly, cash transfer scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana and Aadhar-mobile numbers are being used to prevent irregularities in social programs
 rasoi gas ke maamle main nakad hastantaran yojana ko bakhubi kaamyaab istemaal ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister has also started the campaign that rich people should sacrifice LPG subsidy for those who are using wood or kerosene oil
 kul milakar, pehle saal main sarkaar ke sakaaratmak kadamon kii fehrist kaaphi prabhaavshaalee he
 The government which has shown so much success in the first year has not been seen in recent times

 It allows women to show their face when necessary or on any special occasion
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘agar ek mahila gambhir rup se biimaar he to vah apane chikitsak se pardaa nahin kar sakati
 Islam allows women to remove the veil for photographs to be placed on voter ID cards and on such essential documents

 The Supreme Court of India has sent notice to the Central and State Government on Article 370
 ek janhit yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue court ne yah notice bheja he
 It is noteworthy that the present Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing an election meeting said that we should consider whether Article 370 is needed or not
 is par sansad main bahes honi chahie
 Article 370 of the Indian Constitution grants special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar, sansad ko jammu or kashmir ke bare main raksha, videsh maamle or sanchaar ke vishay main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar he, lekin kisi anya vishay se sambandhit kanoon ko lagu karwaane ke liye centre ko rajya sarkaar kaa anumodan chahie
 Due to this special status, Article 356 of the Constitution does not apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 is kaaran raashtrapati ke paas rajya ke samvidhan ko barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Urban Land Law of 1976 does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 iske tahat bhartiya naagarik ko vishesh adhikaar praapt rajyon ke alaava bharat main kahin bhi bhoomi kharidne kaa adhikaar he
 That is, people of other states of India cannot buy land in Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya samvidhan kii anuchhed 360 jisamen desh main vittiya apatkaal lagane kaa praavdhaan he, vah bhi jammu or kashmir par lagu nahin hoti
 Modi's statement may be a part of the bjp's thoughtful strategy as the party has been incorporating Ram temple construction, Article 370 and the Uniform Civil Code in its manifesto since the beginning

 All India Majlis-e Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president and MP Asaduddin Owaisi has objected to the cow protection law
 ovaisi ne kaha he ki majahab or aasthaa ke naam par koi kanoon nahin ban saktaa
 Let us know that on Sunday, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had demanded a law to be enacted to prevent cow slaughter
 or kya bole ovaisi
 
 
 On a law in the country against cow slaughter, Owaisi said- BJP speaks double talk
 north east main bijepi kahati he ki vahaan par gau hatya ke khilaaf koi bill nahin laaenge
 Why this is a dual policy
 ovaisi ne gauraksha ke naam par hatyaon kaa masalaa bhi uthaaya
 He said - More than 9 Muslims have been killed in the name of cow protection in the Modi government
 ovaisi ne alvar kii ghatana kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said that the country is benefiting from such incidents
 aasthaa ke naam par kanoon nahisaduddin ovaisi kaa kahana he ki kanoon majahab kii buniyaad par nahin banaaya jaataa he
 Laws are also not made on the basis of faith
 ovaisi kaa maananaa he ki agar majahab ke naam par kanoon banaae gaye to hindu raashtra ho jayega
 This is not good for the country
 gauraksha ke naam par hinstlavar ghatnaka zikr karte hue ovaisi ne mohan bhagwat ko naseehat di
 Owaisi said that Bhagwat ji should read the FIR of Alwar incident
 usamen vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal kaa naam aayaa he
 These people are the people who work on their gestures
 mohan bhagwat ne kya kaha thaares pramukh mohan bhagwat ne ravivaar kogohatya ke khilaaf deshbharamen ek kanoon banane kii vakaalat kii thi
 He also advised them to follow the law while protecting animals from surveillance groups
 unhone kaha tha, 'ham deshbhar main gohatya par roak lagane vaala kanoon chaahate hai
 ' deraa pramukh ram rahim ko rape kaa doshi tehraay jane ke baad soshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he jisamen vah viraat kohli, ashish nehra ko cricket kii koching or boxr vijendra singh ko boxing sikhaane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 It can be clearly heard in the viral video on the internet that Ram Rahim is saying that he is the one who gave cricket coaching to Virat and then he has become such a big cricketer today
 'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram viral test main ram rahim ke in daavon kii padtaal kii gai he
 Ram Rahim says in the video that he also has videos in which he has taught cricket tricks to Virat Kohli
 internet par talash ke baad hamen ek video mila jo 2010 kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 In the video, Virat Kohli and Ashish Nehra are seated with Rah Rahim and Ram Rahim on the stage is giving them some tips
 kareeb ek minute ke video main ram rahim donon cricketrs ko gusse par kaabo rakhane or maidan parapasinaa bahaane ke tipsto de rahe hai lekin usamen cricket se jude koi khaas tips kaa kahin koi zikr nahin he
 It is clear from the video that this video is from the early days of Virat when he used to play cricket for Delhi with Ashish Nehra
 video main ram rahim ke tips ke baad nehra, viraat or vijay dahia ram rahim ke saath ek photo bhi khinchvaate hai or ram rahim unhen match ke liye shubhakamanaayen bhi detaa he
 But the video does not prove that Virat has learned cricket from Ram Rahim
 ram rahim ke viral video main vah boxr vijendra singh kaa zikr bhi kar rahe hai
 He can be heard saying that after learning boxing from him, Vijender won the medal in Olympics and became a world famous boxer
 unke is daawey kii padtaal bhi internet ke jariye kii gai
 On searching, no such video was found in which Ram Rahim is teaching boxer to boxer Vijendra
 ek 53 senkad kaa video internet par maujuud he jisamen vijendra manch se bol rahe hai or peeche se ram rahim kii aawaaj sunai de rahi he
 Vijender Singh is thanking Ram Rahim from the stage and Baba is blessing him, but the video shows that he is at an event when Vijender is praising him on Baba's stage
 haalanki video ko dekhakar yah kahin se nahin lag rahaa ki unhone ram rahim se boxing sikhi he yaa ram rahim ne unhen kabhi mukkebaaji kii training di ho, is video main baba ko mukkebaaz vijendra ko salaah dete jarur suna ja saktaa he
 On seeing both the videos, it does not seem that Virat or Vijendra have taken training or coaching of their respective sports from Ram Rahim
 video kii padtaal se ram rahim ke daavon main sachai nahin lagati he
 But this video is definitely a message for the players that these celebrities need to be more vigilant about the product or person they associate with
 viral test kaa puraa kaarykram yahaan dekhen: ICC Chief Executive (CEO) Dave Richardson made it clear that the sports governing body cannot force India to play a bilateral series against Pakistan

 But due to political conditions, India refused to play the series
 lahore main media karmiyon se baat karte hue richardsan ne is baat ko bhi nakaar diya kiaisisika pakistan cricket kii tulana main bharat kii taraf adhik jhukaav he
 He said, "if India is not ready to play with Pakistan, then we cannot force them
" richardsan ne kaha, dwipaksheeya siries do cricket board ke bich aapasi samjhaute se kheli jaati hai
 We also want India and Pakistan to play bilateral series but there is political tension between them and cricket of any kind depends on the existing relationship

 Sejatsiasiyat has always been of great importance in the politics of Rajasthan
 lekin ashok gahalot or vasundhara raaje ke siyaasi sangharsh ke chalate soobe kii jat raajnneeti main siyaasi shunya kaayam ho gaya
 Despite being a powerful community, this community did not get the importance that they had hoped for
 ab jat raajnneeti main aae is shunya ko bharne ke liye jat netaa or khinvsar se nirdaleey vidhayak hanuman beniwal ne puri birdari ko ikattha karne kii kavayad shuru kii he
 After independence, the monarchy ended and democracy was established
 saamanti-jameendaari khatm hone ke baad rajput congress ke khilaaf ho gaye to kisaan varg yaa jat samudaay apni jameen waapas milane par congress ke saath khadey ho gaya
 In Shekhawati, Marwar, Anchal, Rajasthan, the Jats shone their politics in the Congress governments
 samooche shekhavati, marwar ilaake main congress party ke tikat par jat vidhayak or saansad kaa chunaav jitate rahe
 Baldev Ram Mirdha is credited for bringing political and social identity to the Jat community in Rajasthan, Jat stalwart of Mirdha, Maderna and Ola Congress
 50 ke dashak main marwar kisaan sabha bana kar mirdha ne congress ke samanaantar sanghathan khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But the then Prime Minister Pt

 The way Hanuman Beniwal is getting the support of Jat youth
 ye samaaj beniwal ko rajasthan ke pehle jat siem ke taur par dekhnaa chahta he
 Seeing the growing political power of Beniwal, Ghanshyam Tiwari, who formed BJP and formed a new party, has spoken of supporting Beniwal
 unhone kaha he ki bharat vahini party rajasthan kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladegi
 But the seats where Beniwal's candidate will win will be supported in those seats
 tiwadi ne yah bhi kaha he ki beniwal se baat chit ke baad hi ve apni party ke ummidavaar tay karenge
 On his Mewar tour here, MLA Hanuman Beniwal has said that a third front will be formed against the congress-bjp in Rajasthan
 saath hi jaipur kii vishaal raily main nai party kii ghoshnaa bhi kii jaaegi
 Beniwal has spoken about giving unemployment allowance of Rs 5000 to the youth
 jo congress dwaara ghoshit 3500 rupee ke berogari bhatte ke jawaab main he
 Beniwal claims that no government would be formed without the support of the Third Front
 baharhaal ab dekhnaa hoga ki dashakon se kaayam siyaasi shunya ko khatm karne ke liye hanuman beniwal kii apil par jat siyasat kaa oont kis karavat baithta he

 Input: IANS san 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav (loksabha Elections) main pehali baar patna loksabhaa kshetra ko baantkar patna sahib or patliputra do loksabhaa kshetra banaae gaye
 
 
 In 2009, Ranjan Prasad Yadav won elections from JDU
 
 Then he defeated Ramkripal Yadav of BJP by a little over 23 thousand votes
 lekin 2014 ke modi lahar main ramkripal ne yah seat jeet lee or argedy kii misa yadav ko maat di
 39 to Ramkripal
 16 fisadi vot mili to misa yadav ko 35
 The difference of 04 percent votes and victory was just 41 thousand votes
 magar 2014 main jediu alag rahi thi or vah kisi gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin thi
 Now he is with BJP and jdu's 9
 93 fisadi vot ko bhi bijepi ke saath jodna padegaa
 So the total number of BJP and JDU votes in the Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency is 49
 09 fisadi hota he
 On the other hand, 5 also to CPIML in Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency
 27 fisadi vot mili the
 In this context, the total votes of all the parties of the Grand Alliance, ie RJD, CPIMS, Congress, add 43 votes
 26 fisadi tak pahunchataa he
 This time also Ramkripal Yadav and Misa Yadav are in the fray
 yah ladaai isliye bhi dilachasp he ki ramkripal ek vakt main lalu ke shishy or sipahasalar hote the
 Not only this, Ramkripal Yadav was a member of the Legislative Council of Bihar on the RJD ticket
 teen baar loksabhaa ke sadsy rahe or ek baar argedy ke tikat par rajyasabha main bhi jitkar aae
 But in 2014, when Lalu Yadav did not give the seat of Pataliputra to Ramkripal Yadav and gave it to Misa Yadav, Ramkripal Yadav got angry and joined BJP and defeated Misa Bharti
 yahi vajah he ki is baar bhi patliputra kii yah seat lalu yadav parivaar ke liye pratishtha kii seat bani hui he
 During the election campaign here, Tejashwi Yadav has raised the issue of reservation and is telling the backward castes that if the Modi government comes to the center then the reservation of backward will be over
 patliputra loksabhaa seat yadav bahul ilaaka he
 There are 5 lakh Yadav, four and a half lakh Bhumihars, 3 lakh Rajput and Kurmi and one and a half lakh Brahmin voters
 patliputra loksabhaa kshetra main 6 vidhansabha kshetra hai jisamen danapur, maner, phulwari, masauthi, paliganj or vikram jaise kshetra aate hai
 Of this, Phulwari and Dakshati are reserved areas
 in vidhansabhaon main se maner,masauthi or paali par argedy kaa kabja he
 While Danapur is dominated by BJP, Phulwari is JDU and Vikram is Congress
 yani 6 vidhansabha main se 4 par mahagathbandhan or do par bijepi-jadyu kaa kabja he 
 This is the reason why Misa Yadav remains a big challenge for Ramkripal, who won just 41 thousand in the 2014 Modi wave
 or isi ne is chunaav ko kantedaar or dilachasp bana diya he
 The Congress was dreaming of defeating the BJP by simply joining hands in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections
 lekin basapa supremeo mayawati ne usee samay rahul gandhi ko tagada jhatka dete hue rajya main apane ummidavaaron kii pehali list jari kar di he
 After the BSP, the Congress may get another blow from Jai Adivasi Yuva Shakti (jayas)

 Hiralal Alava did aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte huegathabandhanke liye congress ko 2 oktober tak kaa ultimatum diya he
 He said that he wants to contest elections together with Congress
 hamaare saath gathbandhan ke liye congress ko faisla karnaa he
 Hiralal said that till October 2, the Congress does not take any decision about the alliance, then we will not wait like Mayawati
 madhya pradesh ke dhar jile ke kukshi main 2 oktober hone vaali raily main apane 80 ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa karenge
 He said that once we announce the names of the candidates, it will be impossible for us to withdraw the decision
 jais ne congress se maangi 25 sitanjays adhyaksh ne bataaya ki madhya pradesh main congress ke saath gathbandhan ke liye pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath, party ke rajya prabharee deepak babariyaa or digvijay singh se mulaakaat kii he
 We have put our conditions to them and we have asked for 25 seats, but so far we have not received any reply
 rahul se nahin hui baat, shivaraj ne diya tha oirhaalanki, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath dow
 Neither Hiralal has talked about nor met anyone
 jabaki unhone rajya ke netaaon se rahul se mulaakat ke liye kaha tha
 Interestingly, Alava was invited by Shivraj Singh Chauhan on 5 August, where he was offered to join the BJP
 haalanki unhone bijepi main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya
 The tribal community has been continuously agitating since 2013 on the issues of tribal community and farmers in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya main adivasee samudaay kii aabaadi 21 pratishat se adhik he
 Out of the total 230 seats in the state assembly, 47 seats are reserved for the tribal class
 iske alaava kareeb 30 siten aisi maani jaati hai, jahaan paryaapt sankhya main adivasee aabaadi he
 Jayas influence in five districts BJP won 32 and Congress 15 out of 47 seats reserved for tribals in the 2013 assembly elections

 BJP national president Amit Shah on Tuesday described the previous Left government of West Bengal as better than the present Trinamool government
 bardaman main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne mamata banerjee sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He alleged that the hands of people coming to the rallies of opposition parties here are cut off and lit with cigarettes, but also claimed that the more tortured the lotus will bloom in the state
 haalaaki is sabha main pashchim bengal kii pichhali raily kii tulana main kam bheed jute pai thi, lekin amit shah pehle hi kii tarah garajte hue saaf kaha ki agar sarkaar hinsa ko protsaahit karegi, to uskaa jawaab diya jayega
 Shah also asked the people if they were ready for change, and then told them that if they wanted development, they would have to form BJP government here too
 amit shah ne bardaman raily ke madhyam se ek baar phir mamata sarkaar par bardaman bam blast se jude aropio ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Earlier, Amit Shah held a rally in Kolkata city last year
 bardaman kii raily main shah ne centre sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan bhi ginaayin, jinamein 10 baar petrol or dijal ke daamon main kami pramukh thi
 On the other hand, the Trinamool Congress has tweeted that the bjp's dreams are not going to be fulfilled in Bengal at present
 lagbhag ek saal se bijepi or narendra modi ke samarthan karne vaali bharat kii pehali ipies afasar kiran bedi aaj bijepi main shaamil ho gai hai
 The party has said that she will contest the election but has not told where she will fight
 bijepi netaa vijay goyal ne twit kiya he ki bijepi kiran bedi ke netritv main zarur jeetegi
 Yesterday, Arvind Kejriwal accused BJP state president Satish Upadhyay that his own company had installed wrong meters in Delhi
 aaj press conference karke kejariwal satish upaadhyaay saboot pesh karne vaale the, par kiran bedi kii khabar ne aap party ko ranneeti badalane par majaboor kar diya or asar yah rahaa he ki kejariwal kii jagah ashutosh ne media ke saamne kathith saboot pesh kiye
 Yesterday, while BJP workers were emboldened by the allegations against the state president, today Bedi's arrival is sure to show a 'ray of hope' to her
 khabar he ki 'aap' party kii purv netaa shazia ilmi or sapa chhod kar rashtri lokdal kii tikat se loksabhaa chunaav ladiin abhinetri jaya pradaa bhi jald bhartiya janata party main shaamil hone ja rahi hai
 Even though Kiran Bedi may be the trump card for the BJP, but she has taken a long time to throw this card
 chunaav main maheenaa bhi nahin bachaa he
 Votes are to be cast on 7 February
 bijepi ne na to apane ummidavaaron ke naamon kii list saarvajanik kii he or na hi ghoshnaa-patr jari kiya he
 BJP workers are not able to campaign vigorously in their areas due to non-selection of candidates
 ghoshnaa-patr ke bina ve janata ko samajha nahin paa rahe hai kii unke vaadon kii potli main dilli ke liye kya he? In response to every question, you cannot always say 'I have Modi'
 jharkhand, maharashtra, haryana, jammu-kashmir main bijepi ko vot modi kii lokapriyata ke saath-saath vahaan kii sarkaar ke khilaaf logon kii naaraazgi ke kaaran bhi mili the
 But the election of Delhi is different
 yahaan sirf modi ke naam se bijepi ko bahumat nahin laa sakati, isliye kiran bedi ko kejariwal ke saamne khadaa kiya he
 Perhaps the low crowds at Modi's rally in Delhi on 10 January forced the BJP to think of something new
 congress dilli ke dangal main aaj mukhya party kii bajaay ek 'vot katwa' party ban kar rah gai he
 Like the BJP, the Congress has not yet released the manifesto, but it has already released the names of 64 of the 70 candidates
 saafe chhavi vaale purv kendriya mantri ajay maakan ko dilli congress kii kaman saunpi gai he
 The weak leadership at the center, the apathy about Rahul Gandhi's party's campaign and the corruption stains in the Congress party add to the difficulties for Ajay Maken
 shila yug to kejariwal ke aane se hi khatm ho gaya tha, jab shila dikshit ko kejariwal ne unheen ke garh main haraaya tha
 So far no major leader of Congress has held any rally
 pichley chunaav main rahul gandhi kii raily main logon ke uthakar jane vaali ghatana unako abhi bhi aatankit kar rahi he
 The AAP party seems to be the most ready in this assembly election
 sabhi ummidavaaron ke naam ke saath ghoshnaptr bhi jari kar diya he
 Has been engaged in campaigning since October
 sabhi ummidavaaron ko apane-apane ilaake pataa hai
 Since the end of November, Kejriwal has been campaigning for the party in every locality of Delhi
 kejariwal party ke star paraformar hai or ab tak unhone 60 se zyaada jansabhaayen kar lee hai or maheene ke ant tak 50 or jansabhaayen karne kii yojana bana rakhi he
 The AAP party claims that Kejriwal has joined nearly three lakh people in these 60 meetings
 party is baar janalokapal ke mudde kii bajaay sthaneey muddon par raajnneeti kar rahi he
 AAP Party is also getting good response from the public due to its unique publicity, transparent financial transactions
 is baar pichley chunaav kii tarah logon main shankaa bhi nahin he ki aam aadmi party ko vot dene se unke vot barabaad honge
 In the Delhi election campaign, the AAP party has gone ahead of the BJP
 kiran bedi ke bijepi main shaamil hone se party ko bhale hi naitik bal mila ho, par yah to samay hi batayega ki kiran bedi apni pehali chunavi raily main kitni bheed juta paati hai or yah bhi samay batayega kii kya kiran bedi kejariwal kaa tod ban paaengi? filhal yah samay he jisaki is samay bahut kami he

 The woman wanted to live peacefully with her lover, but destiny was allowed something else
 train main laavaaris mili bacchiyaan ek sanstha main pahunchaai gayi
 Later his real father was also discovered
 par maa or uskaa premi nahin pahunche, jinhone inhen laavaaris banane main koi kor-kasar nahin choda tha
 These sisters, aged three years and 8 years, do not even know that the mother who raised them raised, escaped suddenly leaving the train on the pretext of taking them to Nanihal
 das din baad jab police ne pita ko khoj nikaala, tab pita ne iske liye in bacchon kii maa ko jimmedaar tehraaya, jisane prem-prasang ke chakkar main inhen raste hataane ke liye aisa kiya
 According to the girls, his mother and his father left him in the train
 mahila kaa plan tha ki in bacchiyon ko raste se hataakar hameshaa ke liye hi laavaaris bana diya jaae
 But Honi had something else approved
 jis gangasagar train par in bacchiyon ko choda gaya, us train main police kii najar bacchiyon par padi
 These girls were then transported to an institution in Patna
 sabase badi bacchee 8 saal kii, duusari 5 saal kii or teesri 3 saal kii he
 Nandini, who is handling the younger sisters, knows that her mother deliberately cheated with them
 yahi vajah he ki pita ko dekhne par use na to khushi hui, na hi wo pita ke saath jane taiyaar hui
 GRP landed these children from Gangasagar Express at 10 am on December 27 at Barauni station in Bihar and was handed over to 'prayas Bharti' institution on 28th
 ye bacchiyaan aapas main bahan hai or apane pita kaa naam rahul raaj bataati he
 The village is named Gangapur
 badi bahan nandini hi camere par kuch bataa paa rahi he, jabaki donon choti- nidhi or rani kuch nahin bol paa rahi he
 The father's name, who came to pick up the children, is Nandlal Vishwakarma, who is accusing his wife and her lover Rahul Raj of abandoning the children
 pita ke mutabik jis rahul raaj ko uski betiyaan pita kah rahi hai, darasal wo uski patni kaa premi he, jisane uski patni ke saath milakar in bacchon ko chhod diya he
 The organization 'prayas Bharti', which has brought the girls, has currently refused to handover these girls to the father, because he who could not keep his children, will be able to keep the case
 philhal pita ko kaha gaya he ki vah kaise inkaa paalan-poshan karegaa, yah bataae
 Nidhi and Rani are so young that they have no idea what happened to her
 lekin nandini ke chehre par udaasi yah saaf bataa rahi he ki vah khud or apane donon bahano ko lekar kitni frick main he
 Now 'prayas Bharti' has become his home
 aisa pehali baar nahin he, jab ladakiyon ke saath aisa ho rahaa he
 Actually, incidents of killing girls, leaving them unclaimed, or selling them often occur
 yah to in bacchiyon kaa saubhaahgya he ki ve bihar main hi pulisavaalon ke najar main aa gayi, nahin to inkaa kya hota, kisi ko nahin maaloom

 neshnal conference netaa umr abdulla ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki agar pidipi or congress unako apnaane ko taiyaar nahin he, to patel ko unki party kaa kaaryakarta kaha ja saktaa he

 After all, who was Ghulam Nabi Patel? Gulam Nabi Patel's real name was Ghulam Nabi Mir

 The reason for this was that he considered Sardar Patel as his ideal

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Sangh officials have not usually appeared in Modi's rallies so far, but this will not happen in Varanasi rally
 vihip va sadhu-santon kii ore se modi ke naam ko pradhanmantri prastut karne kaa dabaav to kumbh ke samay se hi badhane laga tha
 After this, such an atmosphere was created that the VHP united the sages and saints across Ayodhya in the name of 84 Kosi and Panchkosi Yatra
 varanasi raily main modi ke manch par vihip ke sangrakshak ashok singhl kaa bhi dikhnaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 Among the sages, Sumerupithadheeshwar Narendranand Saraswati, Mahamandaleshwar Santosh Das, Chief of Satua Baba Ashram, Yeti Nandan, Ramkamal Vedanti are said to be prominent among saints
 haalanki raily kii taiyaari se jude bijepi netaa is bare main khulkar kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin he lekin dabi jubaan se unka kahana he ki modi se iske liye green signal milane kaa intjaar he
 With only three days left in the rally, preparations have gained momentum

 There is a need to accelerate the stagnant economy immediately

 But the finance minister himself can get entangled in a trap

 Problems that we pose ourselves: Labor-based industries in India are unable to compete with China due to inefficient policies in Jalandhar, India's richest state of Punjab
 yah un chote udyogon kaa garh he jahaan bade paimaane par shram sansaadhan kaa istemaal karne vaale udyog hai
 He specializes in making sporting goods, industrial valves, hand machines and shoes, he is scared of competition from China
 is khatre se unhen thodi raahat mili he kyonki china menaakhirkaar shramikon ke vetanman badhane shuru ho gaye hai
 But according to Mukul Verma, 30, director of Savi International, India's largest football and rugby ball manufacturer, "chinese manufacturers sell their goods at least 20-25 per cent less than ours
" ' saal main 600 karod ru
 Indian sports goods export is less than 1% of the world market according to Verma

 44-year-old Anuj Pasricha, owner of soccer international, a company that makes sports goods, says they are ready to pay more than the NREGA provided the workers meet
 lekin ve utpaadakta ko lekar ashankit hai
 He says, 'in China 22 workers make 500 footballs a day
 vahiin bharat main 100 shramik ek din main itani footbal banaate hai
 Stringent laws also pose problems in keeping workers
 bharat ke shram kanoon 1940 or 1950 ke dashak ke hai or angrejon ke jamaane se chale aa rahe hai
 There is a great deal of opinion in Indian industry that there is a need for a change in the laws, especially in those sections which curb the 'keep and remove' policy
 lekin shram kanoonon main badlaav kii sambhaavna bahut kam dikhti he
 Yashwant Sinha was the only finance minister to speak of reforming the labor law in his 2002 budget speech
 lekin unki party ne unhen kadam khinchne par majaboor kar diya
 There are more shortcomings created by the government in the labor-intensive small and medium enterprises sector

 The government gives excise duty exemption to companies whose annual turnover is 1

 According to the Planning Commission, the government achieved about 50 per cent of the power generation target in the three five-year plans between 1992 and 2007

 Market problems facing agricultural produce Banana growing farmers in Jalgaon, Maharashtra are happy with the subsidy provided by the Central Government on fertilizer
 desh kii is kelaa rajdhani ke kisaanon ne pichley mausam main 6
 20 lakh tonnes of manure is used which is the highest in the state and third most in the country after Guntur (andhra Pradesh) and Gurdaspur (punjab)
 lekin kisaanon ko khaad par sabsidi se jo laabh hota he, use bhartiya railway bekaar kar detaa he
 The surplus produced by the farmers of Raver, Yaval, Mukti Nagar, Chopda and Jalgaon taluka through inexpensive manure needs to be dispatched quickly to large markets in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 kisaanon kii shikaayat he ki unke kshetra se bade bazaaron ke liye koi sidhi malgadee na hone ke kaaran unka jaldi nasht ho jane vaala utpaada samay par bazaar main nahin pahunch paata

 Due to drawbacks in the extortion policy, farmers of those areas also cultivate rice and wheat where the soil is suitable for fruits and vegetables
 is vajah se falon or subjiyon kii aapurti kam ho jaati he or unki keemten bad jaati hai
 Farmers also do not get full benefit of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act
 is kanoon ke tahat, simit sankhya main hi vyapaaree mandi tak apni pahunch bana sakate hai
 Then the traders, who often form their own union, buy their produce from the farmers at very low prices
 kisaanon ke paas ekmaatr vikalp yah he ki ve sthaneey bazaaron ko nazarandaaj kar niryaat bazaaron tak apni pahunch banaaen
 But when the prices of a commodity start increasing, the government stops its exports
 isse bhi kisaan apane laabh se vanchit ho jate hai
 If the government wants to be the engine of growth in the future, it will have to change its outlook on agriculture

 chhattisgarh main november 2008 se anaaj kii ugaahi ke liye 1,577 centre hai jo internet ke jariye raipur main khaadya vibhaag se jude hue hai
 The government keeps an eye on the grain when it is taken from the collection centers to fair price shops

 So, when a truck is sent to a fair price shop, an SMS is sent to the village head and local ngos

 Truck drivers also have to record the unloading process on their phone cameras and send it to the central server via MMS

 The result of all this is that theft has reduced very much

 The news of this event held in Mumbra was also published in the Marathi newspaper, Lokmat
 india today ne sab-inspector vinayak karade se bhi baat kii jo is viral video main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Karade told us that he celebrated Qaumi Ekta Week by distributing Tasbeeh on 29 November in front of the Kausa Mosque of Mumbra
 karade ne kaha, 'sirf kaumi ekta saptaah ke dauraan hi nahin, balki har shuukravaar ko muslim samudaay ko badhai dete hai or kabhi-kabhi gulab ke phool bhi baantate hai
 We believe that this increases unity between the police and the people and reduces the distance between them

 'karade also sent us some pictures in which he and his other co-workers are seen distributing flowers to the people of the Muslim community
 unhone kaha ki yah tasviren 22 november ko lee gai hai
 We have also tried to talk to the members of the Kausa Mosque
 unka jawaab aate hi is lekh ko apadet kar diya jayega
 But it is clear that the event which is seen in the video that is going viral is of Qaumi Ekta week which is celebrated every year in the whole country and it has nothing to do with the new government in Maharashtra

 input: bhashaa The second season confirms what was hinted at in the first season of the Sacred Games — Pankaj Tripathi's Guruji is the charm that will keep most of the content of this web show with him
 pehle se ab is web sho ko dekhne lage hai
 Tripathi says he is 'excited' and 'curious' about people's reaction to the show
 gangs of vasepur (2012) ke baad se nirdeshak anuraag kashyap ke saath ve pehali baar kaam kar rahe hai
 "I have a special affection for Anurag," says Tripathi
 ve mujhe puri aazaadee dete hai
 "did Tripathi worry that his Guruji's role should not be seen as an act of hurting Hindu sentiments?" They keep silence on this
 treepathi kehete hai, ''main abhinayta hum, mujhe jo likhit saamagree milti he, main uske saath kaam karata hum
 In Newton (2017), Tripathi overpowered the negative character of Atma Singh
 ve secred games main bhi aisa karne kaa iraadaa rakhte hai: ''koi insaan puri tarah nakaaratmak nahin ho saktaa he
 His humanity may be hidden but cannot disappear
 ise dhundhna meraa kaam he
 The web show format is not new for Tripathi
 netflix ke secred games se pehle unhone amejan prime ke mirzapur (2018) or hotstr ke criminal justise (2019) main abhinay kiya he
 "I am probably the only actor to have worked for the three major OTT platforms in the country
" main kah saktaa hum ki filmon main bade-chote ke anusaar praathamikta milti he, vahiin web siries main pratibha sarvopari hoti he
 Tripathi first came on screen in the film Run (2004)
 phir unhone ek dashak sa nayaa pahalu secred games ke ek drishy main saf or kalki (upar) or sho kaa ek drishy bhi adhik samay tak sangharsh kiya
 They understand that popularity should be better managed, not misused
 ve kehete hai, ''main haal hi main glassgo main shooting kar rahaa tha
 a family came to know that i am there
 ve mere liye poha kharid laae
 People do not believe that i am an actor
 unhen lagata he ki main unamem se hi ek hum
 The 42-year-old actor has about a dozen projects in 2019 alone
 ve kehete hai, ''mujhe lagata he ki main jarurat se zyada kaam kar rahaa hum
 When the work is completed, i would like to spend three months' leave and spend time with the family
 pehle, mere paas zyada kaam nahin tha
 Now i have too much work
