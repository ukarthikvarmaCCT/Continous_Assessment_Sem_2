 ' Jind by-election of Haryana is no longer an election to choose just one MLA, because Congress national spokesperson and MLA from Kaithal Randeep Surjewala has decided to contest from here, making this by-election a topic of discussion at the national level
 har jagah yahi baaten ho rahi hai ki surajevaala aakhir ye jokhim kyon le rahe hai
 This is the reason why Surjewala is seen giving clarification on every point in his meeting why he has come to contest Jind by-election
 surajevaala yah bhi kehete hai ki yadi ve jeet gaye to jind se hi vidhayak rahenge or kaithal chhod denge
 But people also believe that if they lose, they will get gritty and their image will be shocked
 vahiin logon ko yah bhi lagata he ki agar wo jeet gaye to mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar honge or haryana kii raajnneeti main unka kad badhegaa
 This is the reason why Surjewala is also at risk of internal violence from his rival Congressmen here
 vaise congress sutron kii maane to congress adhyaksh ne jab randeep surajevaala ko bula kar kaha ki aapako jind kaa upachunaav ladanaa he to surajevaala ne kaha ki wo to kaithal se vidhayak hai
 So Rahul told him that not every election is fought to win, some elections are also fought to save the credibility of the party
 rahul kii soch sahi hi he
 The condition of the Congress in Haryana is bad and it is the fourth party
 yahi vajah he ki kaaryakartaaon main bharosa paidaa karne ke liye jind upachunaav ko congress ne shuruuaat ke taur par liya he
 Well, if you look at the history of Jind, three people have dominated the politics here, one of them is Chaudhary Birendra Singh who was earlier in Congress but now is in BJP and is a minister in the center
 duusare maange laal gupta hai jo ab kaaphi bujurg ho gaye hai haalanki sabhi dalon ne koshish kii ki ve chunaav lard len unki partiyon se magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Mange Lal was seeking tickets for his son but was not successful in it
 or tisare vyakti hai shamsher singh surajevaala jo narwanaa se chunaav jitate rahe, baad main randeep surajevaala ne kaman sanbhali or ek chunaav main omprakash chautaala ko haraa kar surkhiyaan batori
 But when the Narwana seat was declared safe, Surjewala left Narwana and went to Kaithal
 ek or vyakti hai jinka naam he jaiprakash jinka yahaan kaaphi dabadabaa he or wo nirdaleey hi chunaav jitate rahe hai magar is baar surajevaala ko sarmathan de rahe hai
 In return, Congress has promised to give his son a ticket in the next assembly
 jind main yadi jati ke aadhaar par sameekaran dekhen to ek lakh sattar hajaar matadaataaon kii is vidhansabha main 45 hajaar jat hai jo nirnaayak bhoomika main hai, 17 hajaar brahamn hai to saini, punjabi, baniyaa or dalit matadaataaon kii sankhya 15 hajaar ke kareeb he jo dalit ke ek hi jati se aate hai, anya dalit alag hai
 While there are 18 thousand other caste voters
 jind upachunaav main rajkumaar saini ne bhi apana ummidavaar utaar rakhaa he jo pehle bijepi main the
 They have the support of 15,000 Saini voters
 saini yahaan votakatwa kii bhoomika main hai
 On the other hand, 15 thousand Punjabi and 15 thousand Baniya voters do not vote together
 inkaa jhagada itnaa bada he ki ye ek duusare kii shaadiyon main bhi nahin jate
 Although BJP has also tried to bring them together, a meeting was called but there was a dispute between them
 yahi nahin jind upachunaav main omprakash chautaala yaa kahen abhaya chautaala ne bispi ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 Obviously, they will keep an eye on 15,000 Dalit votes
 baaki anya dalit jati kaa vot bantega
 The Congress is also eyeing these votes, which is why the state president of Haryana Congress, who is a Dalit himself, is promoting Surjewala on a motorcycle in Jind
 bache 45 hajaar jat voton ke liye ajay chautaala ke beton dushyant or digvijay din raat ek kiye hue hai
 But Abhay Chautala and his sons Karan and Arjun are busy giving them a tough fight
 isi jat vot par surajevaala kii bhi najar he
 That is to say, Khes is still open in Jind by-election
 congress ne surajevaala ko jind bhej kar chauthe paanchaven number par naa aane kii ladaai lard rahi he to duusari taraf dushyant or digvijay apane dada om prakaash chautaala ko galat sabit karnaa chaahate hai or apane ko choudhary devilil kaa asli vaaris sabit karnaa chaahate hai
 While Abhay Chautala wants to prove that INLD and his election symbol are dominated by Haryana
 duusari ore bijepi yah seat jeet kar mukhyamantri khatter kii laaj bachaana chaahati he
 This is the reason why Jind is at stake for everyone in the by-election and this is the reason why Jind's battle is going to be spectacular and life-threatening
 usne apni jindagi kaa pehla jurm kiya tha, wo bhi behad sangeen jurm
 Now after committing the crime, he had to keep the secret of that crime buried in his chest forever
 raaj to seene main dafan ho gaya lekin jurm seene main dafan nahin ho saktaa tha, lihaaja usne apane us jurm ko apane hi ghar ke angan main hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye dafna dene kaa faisla kiya
 But this dangerous story started with a missed call, opened by a single call
 uttar pradesh ke aligarh jile kaa ek kasbaai ilaaka, nalakup colony or usee ilaake kaa janaa-pahachaanaa ghar
 Famous because it lives in this house, ITBP i
e
 indo-tibet Border Police jawan Ajit
 par subah-subah colony ke is ghar main ajeeb gahamaa-gahami he or is gahamaa-gahami kii teen vajahen hai
 First, why Haryana Police entered this house of UP
 doosraa, ardhsainik bal ke jawan ajit ke haathon main hathkadi kyon he or teesraa, police vaale apane saath majdoor lekar yahaan kyon aae hai
 The handcuffs were telling that Ajit had committed a crime, but why the Haryana police had arrested him and brought him to his house and brought what the whole police team had come to find in the courtyard of Ajit's house
 aakhir angan main ajit ne aisa kya chupa rakhaa he
 The questions of the people of the colony were countless, but the answer was not available because no one was allowed to enter the house
 khayr, ajit ke ghar ke angan main pahunchate hi pulisavaale ajit se kuch poochhate hai
 Ajit gestures and the workers accompanying him start digging right at Ajit's place
 angan kii khudaai shuru ho chuki thi
 The laborers were busy with their work
 jameen par padane vaale har fawde ke saath pulisavaalon kii dhadakanen tej hoti ja rahi thim
 In between, the policemen would ask Ajit again
 ajit kuch yaad karata or phir mazdooron ko ishaara karata ki khudaai kahaan-kahaan kerani he
 The digging is on continuously
 angan main dhire-dhire ab gaharaa gaddha banataa ja rahaa he
 The depth is increasing with every shovel but the wait of the policemen is not over yet
 abhi bhi unhen wo nahi mila he jisaki talash main wo haryana se yahaan tak aae hai
 So the policemen would get restless and they would start questioning Ajit again
 takreeban ghante bhar se zyada kaa vakt biit chukaa tha
 The pit had also deepened
 ab pulisavaale mazdooron ko hidaayat dete hai ki thodaa sanbhal kar khudaai karo
 Perhaps now the search was going to be completed, maybe now that secret was going to spill from inside any moment and suddenly it also spilled out
 ardhsanik bal ke jawan ajit ke angan se jo pehali cheez baahar ai wo ek ladki kaa pair tha
 Carved in the courtyard, one foot came out from the depths of this grave and then a whole corpse but the question was who the corpse was after all and who was buried in the courtyard of the house here
 to is qabr ke iklaute raajadaar shaks ne jab apana munh kholaa, to sunanevaale bas sunate rah gaye
 After nearly an hour of digging, the leg of a girl coming out of the ground has surprised all the people present here
 is pair ke baahar aane ke baad majdoor ab apni khudaai or tej kar dete hai or phir dekhte hi dekhte angan ke neeche se jo kuch baahar aata he, usase logon ke rongte khadey ho jate he
 Actually, the body of a girl was buried not just in the courtyard but this corpse, now the corpse was less but more skeletal
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki maranevaali ko yahaan shaayad maheenon pehle dafnaaya gaya tha
 After a brief effort and careful digging, the work of removing the corpse is completed and the corpse draped in the salwar kameez gets the corpse set aside for forensic investigation
 sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki aakhir ye ladki he koun
 What relationship does the dying girl have with this house or Ajit
 agar maranevaali ajit kii koi jaankaar he, to phir use is tarah ghar ke angan main hi dafnaae jane ke peeche kya vajah ho sakati he
 Is it not that Ajith is the killer of this girl? jab ajit apana munh kholta he, is laash kii tarah hi isse jude tamaam raaj ek-ek kar jameen ke neeche se baahar aa jate hai
 Ajit, an ITBP trooper, tells that he had his first conversation with the girl buried in the courtyard about nine months ago
 wo ek bhi ek missd kol kii vajah se
 Actually, it was the girl who accidentally gave him a missed call and that same missed call became the reason for this girl's death
 is missd kol kii badaulat ajit kii us ladki se baatcheet hone lagi or phir donon ko ek-duusare se pyaar ho gaya lekin aage jaakar donon ke rishte kharaab ho gaye
 Actually, this new lover of Ajit had known a secret about her, which was very important for Ajit to hide, as Ajit's life would have been ruined as soon as this secret was common, but the girl is now saying this secret There was pressure on him
 phir ek vakt aisa aayaa, jab ajit ko apni mashooqa se peechha chhudaane ke liye use maut ke ghat utaarna hi zyada munasib laga or bas, isi iraade se pehle to usne ladki kaa galaa ghont kar katl kiya or phir duniyaavaalon kii nigahon se bachane ke liye usne apane hi ghar ke angan main use dafna diya
 This story of Ajit and his lover may never come in front of time, but one day the policemen got a glimpse of his handiwork from a mobile phone
 ye shaayad us ladki taqadir hi thi, jisane usase ek aisa missd kol karavaaya, ki wo sidhe ek kabr main pahunch gai
 He completed this journey to reach his own murderer by a missed call, but it took the policemen a full nine months to reach the secret of this tomb: Sunita, studying in degree college in Mahendragarh, Haryana, met one of her friends that day Tried to give him a missed call to talk
 lekin galati se ye missd kol uski saheli ke paas nahin, balki aligarh ke rahanevaale itibipi ke jawan ajit ke paas pahunch gai
 Ajit immediately returned the call to that number and the conversation of both started
 ab tak ajit or sunita donon ek-duusare se puri tarah anjaan the lekin bas is ek missd kol ne donon ko ek-duusare ke kareeb laa diya
 Although Ajit was already married, but he never told this to Sunita and then one day Sunita put the matter of marriage in front of Ajit
 ajit ne pehle to use taalane kii koshish kii lekin jab sunita ne zid pakad lee, to ajit ne use apane paas greater noida main bula liya
 Here both of them started living as husband and wife in a rented house but since both were not married, Sunita often pressured Ajit to get married
 isi bich ek roj ajit kaa sabase bada raaj sunita ke saamne fash ho gaya or ye raaj tha ajit ke pehle se shaadishuda hone kaa
 Just then, both of them had a fight and then a fight
 sunita ne donon ke rishte kii baat jamaane ke saamne aam kar dene kii dhamkee di
 After this, one day in December last year, he fraudulently summoned Sunita to the house of Aligarh
 us rose ajit ke bivi-bachche baahar gaye hue the lekin ghar main ajit ke biimaar or buzurg pita maujuud the
 Despite this, Ajit managed to escape Sunita's eyes and strangled Sunita first and after overnight she ditched her own courtyard and buried Sunita's body
 udhar, sunita ke gharavaale mahendragarh main apni beti ko dhundh-dhundh kar thak gaye or unhone police se shikaayat kii lekin tab police ne sunita ko dhundhane kii zyaada jahamat nahin uthaai
 However, on the pressure of the family members, the police got the call details of Sunita's mobile number, and then her conversation with Ajit and her location was clear till her death
 ab haryana police ne foran ajit ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha shuru kii
 At first he tried to manipulate the police, but on strictness, he unleashed the whole secret

 We found that Fact Checkwebsite Snopes published an article about this video in 2015

 He wrote in the description of this video that he made this video with the help of fwsim software on the occasion of New Year and it took him about a week to prepare this original artwork
 is tarah spasht hua ki yah video kareeb saat saal purana he or yah mumbai kaa video nahin he
 Even this is not a real video of fireworks anywhere but a digital creation that has been created with the help of software

 Germany: Government funding is done to national political parties and it is decided based on their past performance

 Local organizations or independent candidates do not receive any subsidy
 free media acces ke naam par apratyaksh madad milti he
 There is a time limit for this and it depends on continuous participation in elections
 italy:yahaan sarkari sabsidi chunaavon ke kharch kaa sabase bada strot he
 However, since 1993, it has been limited to campaigning
 sabsidi kii rakam chunaav ke dauraan daale gaye voton or ummidavaaron ko mili vot ke aadhaar par tay hoti he
 The government requests taxpayers or party supporters for partial approval of government subsidies

 kya vyaavhaarik he sarkari fundingyahan gaur karne vaali baat he ki puri tarah sarkari kharch par chunaav karnaa mumkin he
 All the committees formed so far on this issue have recommended that government funding of political parties or elections in India is not practical
 iske liye apratyaksh tareeke se sarkari sabsidi kaa vikalp behatar rahegaa
 1
 desh kii maujuuda aarthik sthiti main chunaavon kaa puraa kharch sarkari khajaane se uthaanaa mumkin nahin he
 With the entire funding from the state exchequer, it will prohibit candidates from accessing alternative sources of funds during election campaign or at the time of election
 agar puri sarkari funding ko chunaavon main hone vaale behisaab kharche ke vikalp ke taur par dekha jaataa he to yah blike mani ko rokane ke liye paryaapt nahin hoga
 Today, the central government should hardly provide funds for poverty removal, health, education and food etc
 as an alternative use of the amount that is being spent on elections today
 2
 Due to financial burden, lack of money and difficulty in implementation, the matching grant system is not possible in India like Germany and UK
 corporate se milane vaali madad aksar bahut zyada hoti he, is vajah se iskaa hisaab rakhana mushkil he
 Because big donors give black money
 aise main partiyon ko hone vaali kul funding kii maatra hi badhegi
 3
 agar chunaavon kaa kharch sarkari khajaane se hoga to desh kii janata par tex kaa bhaar doguna ho jayega
 Apart from this, corruption will be increased due to unaccounted money coming to the parties
 4
 Partial funding model in India may prove to be better in which recognized national and regional parties will get equal time to campaign through the state media

 The Law Commission, in its 255th report on electoral reforms, stated that in view of the problems related to the economic situation and development of the country, complete government funding is not possible in elections

 dakshin africa ke abi divilliars kii chhavi cricket maidan ke chaaron ore joardaar stroke lagane vaale ballebaaj kii he, lekin haal main unka ek alag rup bhi saamne aayaa he
 This is the form of a friend and friend of his captain Virat Kohli of RCB in IPL
 divilliars ke anusaar, viraat kohli ne khel ke prati unka junun barkaraar rakhane main madad kii he
 With this, De Villiers claimed that he helped his captain of the IPL team learn the art of staying calm under pressure
 tippaniyan Kohli and de Villiers play for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and are also considered good friends off the field
 divilliars ne ‘iespncricainfo’ se kaha, ‘main usase kuch saal aage hum
 i think i am like him
 ham donon hi khel ko kaaphi junun, urja or achche kaushal ke saath khelte hai, apane khel par kadi mehnat karte hai or haar bilkul bhi sweekaar nahin karte
 He said, 'I like to see his passion
 vah meri adhik umr main mujhe yah jajba de rahaa he
 The South African star claimed that he also had an influence in pacifying Kohli
 divilliars ne kaha, ‘usne (viraat ne) jo cheez mujhase sikhi he vah shaayad kuch had tak chizon ko niyantrit karnaa, dabaav main shant rahanaa or spasht tathaa sahi faisle lene ke liye kabhi kabhi junun ko kuch had tak chhipaana shaamil he
 'he said,' i think he is very close to achieving this and maybe this is something he has seen in me
 ’ De Villiers of South Africa is very close to the figure of 1 xxrep 4 0 test runs
 vaise, 8074 ran banane ke baavjood vah ise badi uplabdhi nahin maanate
 De Villiers is still unable to play in IPL 10 due to backache but said that he has no problem recovering from injury even at the age of 33
 unhone kaha ki jab-jab main chot ke kaaran baahar hua hum, maansik rup se or majboot hokar maine vaapasi kii he

 The agency had filed an FIR against NTPC directors Biswal, Bathina and Prabhat Kumar
 sibiai karrwai ke baad sarkaar ne biswal ko nilambit kar diya
 (from input language) bharatiyon or pakistaniyon main kya fark he? jawaab aasaan haih koi fark nahin he
 We are the same people, the strength of our personality is the same and the collective weakness is also the same
 phir aakhir apane astitv ke chah dashakon ke baad bhi donon desh naatakeey dhang se do juda rahon par kaise nikal pade?bharat or pakistan keval simaaon se hi alag-alag nahin, balki mularoop se hi paraspar vipareet vichaardhaara se bane hai
 India believes in a secular nation where all religions are equal; Pakistan believes that the foundation of a nation can be laid on the basis of religion
 do raashtra kaa siddhant, jiske aadhaar par pakistan kaa janm hua, is upmahadweep ke sabhi musalamaanon ko hinduon se alag nahin karata
 As many Muslims are in Pakistan, as many are living in India and there is no bar for them to accept their religion
 pakistan is purvaagrah ke saath bana ki hindoobahul bharat main musalmaan barabari kii jindagi basar nahin kar sakate, jiskaa bhartiya musalamaanon ke rajnatik yaa saamaajik itihaas main koi aadhaar nahin miltaa
 It was a concept that grew on the barren land of inferiority complex
 moulana aaazaad or devband ke adhiktar ulma jaise bhartiya musalmaan is soch se katai sahamat nahin the
 He argued that Islam belongs to brotherhood and not nationality because religion is related to Allah while the nation is related to human beings
 is vichaar ke paksh main unhone anubhav aadhaarit saboot bhi pesh kiyah agar aasthaa hi aapas main jodne kii buniyaad hoti to bhala itane saare arab desh kyon hote? alag raashtra ke pairokaron ko lagata tha ki dharti par jananath utaarne kaa rasta yahi he or unki hathvadita bharat kii ekta kii aawaaj buland karne vaale logon ko khaarij kar detii he
 Well, it took three decades for the time to pass its first verdict
 varsh 1971 main do raashtra kaa siddhant tab dhah gaya jab pakistan kii ek badi aabaadi alag hokar bangladesh ke rup main saamne ai
 In the 1950s, many people believed that the liberated nation's residents were incapable of adopting a high-level system like democracy and that India's idealistic one-nation theory would burst like a water bubble while Pakistan would achieve stability while developing
 Will keep moving in the direction
 haalanki aazaadee ke 10 saal ke bheetar pakistan ke rajyatantr ne dam tod diya tha, lekin shuru ke varshon main yah dikh rahaa tha ki pakistan kahin adhik behatar saamaajik or aarthik maahaul kaayam kar saktaa he
 In the mid-1960s, when the layers of the objective of Pakistan's existence started coming down, the leaders of Pakistan learned the opposite lesson from their experience
 apane astitv ko banaae rakhane ke liye dharm-tantra se alag raah akhriyaar karne kii bajaae unhone isi par chalane kaa faisla kar liya
 Elite and jaded barrister Mohammad Ali Jinnah converted the rumor of the 1930s that Islam would be endangered by the Hindus as soon as the British left India, turning them into a storm in the 1940s and based on this slogan, they raised the slogan of separate Pakistan
 Elevated
 vidambnaa yah he ki jinna hi vah pehle pakistani the jinhen is baat kaa ehsaas hua ki jis siddhant ko unhone hawa di, uske saath kaise khatre jude the
 Jinnah had a dream of building Pakistan as a Muslim-secular nation
 vaise saarvajanik taur par unhone ek baar yah baat maani thi jab ve march, 1947 ke duusare saptaah main pakistan samvidhan sabha ko pehali baar sambodhit kar rahe the
 Though he never understood Gandhi's views as acceptable, but if he had listened to them, it would have been a reflection of India
 gandhi ek akhand or dharmanirpeksh raashtra chaahate the jo hindoobahul ho
 There was a big difference
 jinna kaa raashtra khaas logon ke liye tha, jabaki gandhi kaa bharat samaveshi tha
 The paths of the two diverged in the mid-1930s
 gandhi or congress ne aazaadee hasil karne ke liye angrejon ke saath sangharsh kiya to jinna or muslim lig ne pakistan ke vajood ke liye congress ke saath ladaai kii
 The British acted like brokers and they did not leave here without recovering their profit
 bahultavaadi janatantr ke taur par bharat ke swaroop ko badi jaldi ek dastavej bhartiya samvidhan main sangrakshit kar liya gaya tha jo bhartiya rashtrawaad kii ridh he
 As far as the debate about Pakistan being a 'muslim nation' was concerned, the effect of its fragrance was reversed and reached the most difficult question: what is the meaning of Islamic country? After the Lahore riots against the Ahmadiyya sect in the 1950s The Justice Munir Commission constituted had made some suggestions: Whatever the Muslim nation was, it was just a dream; In any case there is no need to tell 'qumat who is a Muslim
 par hadon ko paar karne ke liye aatur kattarwadiyon ko vivek kii salaah shaayad hi sachet kar paati he
 Maulana Maududi, the Godfather of Pakistan and the founder of jamaat-e-islami, quickly marginalized Pakistan's father Jinnah
 vaise, chunavi ran main jamaat phiseddi rahati he kyonki matadaata shashan kii bagdor thame mullah par vishwaas nahin karte lekin desh kii vichaardhaara par uskaa jabardast prabhaav he jo lagaataar bad rahaa he
 The extremism of Maududi and the failure of Islamabad to control its heirs like Hafiz Mohammad Saeed not only affected the relations between India and Pakistan, but it also shook the social fabric of Pakistan
 parivaar or alpsankhyak kanoon thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 Many tribal areas have become barbaric
 yahi vajah he ki maine apni kitaab chinagaariah pakistan kaa ateet or bhavishya main pakistan ko 'jelly state' kaha he
 The past and future of Pakistan is like jelly which cannot remain stable, but it is not even buttery enough to melt and lose its existence
 chunki vahaan ek taraf aatankwaad kaa dhaancha he or duusari ore parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa jakhira he
 So he has become a toxic jelly state
 bharat jiskaa mukhya shikaar he
 On the other hand, the basic philosophy of the creation of India itself has become the security shield of India and is protecting it from many floods
 loktantr kii aushadhi ne pashchimottar or purvottar kshetron kii yantranaa par maraham kaa kaam kiya he; sikhon kii asuraksha kii bhaavana ki dharmanirpeksh bharat main unka majahab khatre main he, se panpi vighatanvaadee vichaardhaara ne beshak hinsak rup akhriyaar kar liya tha, par jaldi hi vah shant bhi ho gaya
 With that fire pit of 1980s, India has again tightly tied the doors of new life energy and is moving towards bright modern development
 bharat ke siddhant ne sabit kar diya he ki vah bhartiya se zyada majboot he; udhar pakistan kaa siddhant pakistani se kamjor siddh hua he
 The division that took place is permanent
 bharat se pakistan or pakistan se bangladesh kaa alag hona, donon hi ghatnaayen aisi hai jo palati nahin ja saktin
 Pakistan's answer is only seen by the face of the person who is remembered in the pictures - Jinnah
 unki vichaardhaara or vyaktigat mulyon se is desh kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin
 There are some things that indicate that Jinnah himself may not have anticipated that the partition would be permanent, like he had not sold his house in Mumbai, while the Nizam of Hyderabad gave him Rs 10 lakh
 kii peshkash kii thi
 Jinnah would have thought that Pakistan would be an independent empire like the British Raj with its borders open
 jo bhi ho agar aaj vah hote to pakistan kii phija main jehar gholne vaale roodhiwaadiyon par laanat bhejte
 Due to the tightness of history, reality does not get special appreciation
 1947 main america saat samandar paar tha, par aaj ek bhartiya pakistan kii tulana main usase zyada najdiki mahasoos karata he; bharat or pakistan ke bich ek himkhand-si chuppi tari he, jise udaaravaadi dharashayi karne kii koshish main lage hai, to kattarwadi use or majboot karne ke liye tatpar hai or log? ve ise jhelane ke liye abhishpt hai

 maine turant adwani se kaha ki agar modi jate hai, to gujarat (bhaajapa ke haath se) nikal jayega
 On the question asked about Advani's rath yatra, Thackeray said, "it is the same
" pehali rathyatra vishaal thi
 The country also needed it, (but) now i do not want to comment on it because they are our friends

 In Chhattisgarh, an IAS officer has again adopted a rebellious attitude
 saal 2012 batch ke iees adhikari shiv anant tayal ne bijepi ke pitru purush pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kii ritiniti par hi sawaal uthaae hai
 That too when Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay is being remembered for his actions not only in Chhattisgarh but in the whole country
 maamla sangyaan main aate hi rajya sarkaar ne is iees adhikari ko mantralay main atech kar diya he
 Shiv Anant Tayal was currently the CEO of Zilla Panchayat of Kanker
 iees afasaron ke belgaum bol lekar rajya sarkaar pehle hi disha nirdesh jari kar chuki he
 In this, administrative service officials have been asked not to express any argument or opinion on social media that may give rise to controversy
 chunki ve sarkari pad par tainaat he lihaaja maryaada main rah kar apana kaam kaaj sampann kare
 But these instructions have also been put in the dustbin by the officers
 chha maah pehle is tayal kii niyukti kanker jila panchayat main CEO ke pad par hui thi
 In his Facebook post, he wrote that Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay did not do any work as a writer or thinker to understand his ideology
 websiton main dhundne par ekatm maanavtawaad par unke sirf chaar lacture milte he, wo bhi pehle se sthapit idia the
 In his post, this officer not only cast doubt on the ideology of the patriarchy of the BJP, but also raised questions
 ek or iees afasar alex paul menon ne haal hi main apni fasebuk post main nyaaypalika ko katghare main khadaa kiya tha
 This case had not even cooled down yet another IAS officer got involved in controversies over his views
 haalanki rajya shashan ne menon ko notice jari kar unase safai maangi thi
 Menon apologized to the government for not giving the tool the dispute
 ab tayal bhi pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay par kii gayi apni tippanee ko lekar maafee maang rahe he
 However, the government neither gave them notice nor asked for them
 balki sidhe kaarywahi kar unhen mantralay ke vitt vibhaag main atech kar diya
 In Chhattisgarh, more than half a dozen IAS officers have made such remarks on the ideology of the leaders of BJP and sometimes on the work of the government, that the political corridor heats up
 tayal kii tippanee or un par hui karrwai ko lekar congress rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kar rahi he
 According to him, Chief Minister Raman Singh has created an emergency like situation in the state
 isamen vichaaron kii abhivyakti tak main pabandi laga di gai he
 Then the CD came and then there was chaos
 ittefaq dekhie ki is baar ek saath desh ke do sabase bade rajyon se do-do sidi ai
 One audio CD and the other video CD
 ek sidi main ek mantri kii besharm harakatein kaid hai to duusari sidi main ek netaa kii gandi soch se judi behayaa baaten
 When the picture CD became common, the minister's chair was snatched away
 or netaa ji kii awaz aam hui to fouran unke sur badal gaye
 First tell you the story of the picture CD and then the truth of the voice CD
 79 saal ke mantri par 29 or 20 saal ke ladakon ke saath yon shoshan kaa aarope laga
 Regardless of how strange it may seem to listen to power, sex and cds, the relationship between them has always been deep
 satta ke nashe main chur netaaon ke daaman par jab jab daag lagata he, har baar kisi aise hi rishte kii hakeekat ek nai kahani ke saath saamne aa jaati he
 The story of the state's powerful Finance Minister Raghavji and his CD, who decide the entire budget of Madhya Pradesh, is similar
 bas kirdaar, chehre or jagah badal dijie to lagegaa ki aisi kahani isse pehle bhi kai baar aap sun chuke hai
 Yes, it is definitely that this is probably the first scandal of a leader or minister in the country to have sex with boys and appear in CD with boys
 is nae trend kii nai sidi main villen ban kar jo cheharaa ubhara he wo hai hamaare bujurg netaa raghavji
 Born in 1934
 isi ravivaar ko 80 ke hone ja rahe hai
 The house is full of grandchildren
 par umr ke is padaav main bhi wo harakat kar baithe ki izzat ke saath-saath mantri kii kursi bhi gai
 From the corridors of power in Bhopal to the media, there is hardly anyone whose pictures are not captured on mobile
 madhyapradesh ke in bujurg vitt mantri par unheen ke do naukaron ne iljaam lagaaya he ki mantri ji ne sarakri naukari dilaane kaa jhansa dekar unka yon shoshan kiya he
 That too many times
 itnaa hi nahin, donon ne baqayada is bare main bhopal ke habibganj thane main shapathpatr dete hue mantri ji ke khilaaf report bhi likhaa di he
 The whole story of this new scandal of CD is like this
 madhyapradesh ke vidisha ilaake se chaar-chaar vidhansabha chunaav jeet chuke vitt mantri raghavji kaa bhopal main sarkari bangala he
 The 29-year-old prince who came from Vidisha also lived in this bungalow
 shuru main wo raghavji ke ghar kaam kiya karata tha
 Later Raghavji got his job in a liquor company in Bhopal itself
 par rajkumaar rahata tab bhi bangale main hi tha
 Rajkumar accuses that the minister promised him a government job
 or isi vaade ko puraa karne ke badale wo uskaa yon shoshan karte the
 Meanwhile, a boy named Ghanshyam of twenty years also reached Vidisha to work on the minister's bungalow
 use bhi mantri ji ne sarkari naukari dilaane kaa vaada kiya tha or mauka milte hi uske saath bhi vahi harakat shuru kar di
 After this, Ghanshyam captured pictures of the prince and minister in objectionable condition on his mobile one day
 saboot ab unke paas tha
 On June 4, both Rajkumar and Ghanshyam became witnesses of each other against the minister and reached Habibganj police station with an affidavit
 unke thane pahunchate hi khabar li ho gai or mobile main kaid tasviir aam
 The evidence was in front, so Shivraj Singh Chauhan woke up in the morning and he hurriedly resigned Raghavji and removed him from the ministerial post
 haalanki istipha dene ke baad bhi raghavji kaa yahi kahana he ki ye unke khilaaf ek sajeesh he or wo paak-saaf hai
 By the way, the minister's wife Heera Ben is also telling her husband innocent and has come out in the field to protect him
 udhar duusari taraf rajya main vipakshi party congress ko baithe-bithaae mudda mil gaya
 The election is close, how can the Congress let this opportunity to attack Shivraj Singh's government
 lihaaza chutki lete hue hamale kiye ja rahe hai 
 By the way, let me tell you that at present the police has not filed any lawsuit against the minister
 police kaa kahana he ki pehle wo sidi or maamle kii jaanch kar le phir aage dekhegi
 Audio CD i UP After this story, we move to Uttar Pradesh, because the next CD is from here
 haalanki is sidi main sirf aawaaj he
 But speak in such a way that no one is ashamed to hear it
 or ye besharm bol kisi or ke nahin balki upi main sattadhari samaajawaadee party ke ek taqatvar netaa ke hai
 In the name of job, how are they asking for a chick from a female worker of her own party
 audio sidi main netaa rambabu yadav or mahila kaaryakarta madhu ke bich baatcheet he
 The leader is making an objectionable wish
 ek behayaa maang rakh rahe hai
 The leader demanded a chick in exchange for a job
 madhu pandey---hello dadda bol rahe hai?rambabu---haa dadda bol rahe hai
 Madhu Pandey --- Dadda Ram - Ram looks very happy today
 
 
 aapane bulaayaa nahin?rambabu---vyavastha to karomadhu pandey---vyavastha kar lee hairambabu---maal khara haimadhu pandey---khush ho jaaoge
 
 
 Get the general secretary or vice-president made in the Dadda State Executive
 
 
 rambabu---shiksha nahin he tumhaari
 
 
 You are coming to Lucknow meeting
 
 
 madhu pandey---haa daddarambabu---saath lekar anamdhu pandey---dadda har baar mahila ko saath lekar aati hunrambabu---mahila nahin
 
 
 Bringing a chick
 
 
 chuja jaanati ho?madhu pandey---nahin dadda, aap hi bataa do
 
 
 Rambabu --- Girl from Chu Mane 19 to 20
 
 
 18 se 20 saal tak kii isse upar nahin
 
 
 Madhu Pandey --- Okay Dad uttar pradesh ke shram pravartan vibhaag ke chairman rambabu yadav khud ko pyaar se dadda kahalwanaa pasand karte hai
 What was not understood was finally explained by Dadda himself
 isliye shaayad ab kuch samajhane kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 But yes aapako itnaa jarur bataa dete hai ki dadda ke saath duusari aawaaj kiski he
 This is Madhu Pandey, a woman worker of Samajwadi Party of Dadda
 madhu pandey kaa ilzaam he ki jab unhone rambabu yadav kii ye demand puri nahin kii to wo unki or unke parivaar ke jaan ke dushman ban gaye
 Actually, Madhu Pandey is an active activist of Samajwadi Party for the last 20 years
 jab unhone apane pati kii naukari or khud ko samaajawaadee party main rajya mahila sanghathan main mahasachiv yaa upaadhyaksh banane ke liye kaha to rambabu yadav ne unase chuja matlab 18 se 20 saal tak kii ladki ko apane saath lakhanu laane ki liye kaha
 On Friday, when the team tried to talk to him about this serious allegation against Rambabu Yadav, he moved to talk to the high command
 lekin shanivaar ko rambabu dobaaraa media ke saamne namoodaar hue or apane upar lagaae aarope se saaf inkaar kar diya
 He said that two Samajwadi Party leaders are behind this conspiracy
 ab chunki maamla sattadhari party kaa he lihaaza police bhi is maamle main bolne se bachati dikhi
 Police say they will think of action only after the forensic examination of the CD
 philhal ye maamla sidi kii forensik jaanch or madhu pandey ke aarope ke bich bich jhul rahaa he
 Both the government and the police are trying to suppress the case more

 sabase badi party hone ke baavjood bhartiya janata party sarkaar nahin bana rahi he or ab shivasena sarkaar banane kii ore bad rahi he

 In such a situation, the speculation is clear that the Shiv Sena is ready to accept the condition of NCP and Congress to form the government in the state

 chunaav kii dhaandhlee ke kaaran aaj aise log chotii par hai, jinhen jila ke jan jivan kaa bhayankar akalyaan bhi vichlit nahin karata, aise samay main hamen agar kisi se koi ummid he to vah aap hi ho sakate hai, jisane sadaa satya or nyaay ke liye hi apni jaan baaji par rakhi he
 Since last March, the suppression cycle of the officers of this district started running on the socialist workers, but now we are also becoming the workers of socialists affected by this brutal repression cycle
 gat march main jabaki jile bhar main bheeshan ann sankat prarambh ho gaya tha, jile ke kone-kone main bhukhi janata dane-dane ko taras rahi thi, chor bazaar khub garm tha or jagah-jagah se bhukhmaree kii khabaren aane lagi thim to ham logon ne darbhanga or madhubani main bhukkhadon ke pradarshan kaa aayojan kiya
 By gathering, taking out the procession tried to draw attention of the officials towards the food crisis, but the result was reversed
 marz ke sahi ilaaj ke bajaay sarkaar ne daman niti ko akhriyaar kiya
 After a few days of silence, the district officials started attacking him due to the inspiration of secret advice
 hamaare saathiyon ko bihar 'mentinence of public order act' kaa shikaar banaaya jane laga
 The law, which was used to create havoc with bloodshed to stop the gatherings and rallies of farmer-laborers and whose successful efforts were written by the Collector, was also implicated in this law
 is kanoon ke asli makasad ko dhyaan main rakhe bina hi, isaki aad main naagarik swatantraaa kaa apharan hone laga
 Implementing 144 sections from village to village prohibited all kinds of meetings and processions
 isi abhiyog main hamaare chune hue saathi giraftaar kar jail main band kar die gaye
 As a result, on April 18, the agrarian peasants of the district, including Hindus, Muslims and women, all participated in seven peaceful demonstrations of great enthusiasm to protest against this unfair arrest
 is jile ke pradarshnon main yah pehla mauka tha
 While people saw hindu-muslims together in thousands
 itane par bhi sarkaar ne in pradarshnakariyon par danga failaane kaa iljaam lagaakar hajaaron mard or auraton ko laathiyon se police dwaara pitwaya
 Filled people in the larynx and threw people in far squares
 thik 1931 kaa drishy ankhon ke saamne utar aayaa tha
 Such atrocities can be a shame for any government
 sabase uttejnaa dene vaali to yah hui ki auraton par berahami ke saath laathiyaan chalaai gayi, unhen sadakon par ghasita gaya or bhaddi-bhaddi gaaliyaan bhi di gayi
 Torn off national flags and wiped shoes from them, and in this connection 97 persons were arrested and jailed on that day

 Where the farmers do not want to give up their legal rights, the landlords try to force them to evict them from the land through lathis and hired goons
 saath hi un kisaanon par mukademe lad dete he
 Landlords have money
 ve aasaani se iskaa upyog kar phayda uthaa sakate hai
 Apart from this, inflation and scarcity spread from side to side has reduced the happiness of the rich people, its effect is very deep on the minds of the officers
 jo sab din se dukhi tha, uske dukh kii pratikriya to swaabhaavik ho gai he, lekin jo sadaa sukhi tha, uskaa thodaa dukh bhi gambhir pratikriya utpann kar detaa he
 The women of the landlords fill themselves with water for their own drinking, this is what makes the community livid, but the women who continue to fill water for their childhood, youth and old age also do not consume anyone
 phir kisaanon or jameendaaron main kuch chetana aa rahi he
 This makes them jealous
 khaskar darbhanga ke sadar sabadivijan ke esadioka to yahi kahana he ki kisaan andolan ham jis tarah bhi hoga, dabaa kar chodenge, yaheen hamen upar se instrection mila he
 Hundreds of false prosecutions are currently being run across the district to harass farmers and peasant activists
 in dhaandhliyon ke chalate jila bhar ke kisaan jis tarah tabah kiye ja rahe he, unamem se do-chaar kaa namoonay ke taur par ullekh kar dena anupyukt na hoga
 In Jagdishpur, Thana Baheda, Darbhanga, in 1939 AD, the peasants fought for their rights, ate bullets, panchayats and the then District Magistrate wants to intervene the lands of the farmers, dozens of prosecutions were conducted to destroy the farmers

 Then what? In Section 107, a bond of one and a half lakhs was demanded from the farmers immediately
 kisaanon ko pakad kar jail main band kar diya gaya or unki gaiyrhaaziri main hi unke gharon ko lutaa jaataa, bina vajan kiye hi har prakaar kaa galla uthaa liya jaataa
 Taking the landlords along, police officers sneak into people's homes and try to harass them by terrorizing the farmers
 kanoonee karrwai bhi is prakaar kii jaati he ki kanoon ke baahar ke kaam bhi usamen samaa saken
 Such action is being done in the entire district
 jin kisaan kaaryakartaaon ko pakadaa gaya, unhen usee jameendaar babu jiske yahaan shraadh ke uplakshya main bhoj kaa aayojan kiya tha, ke yahaan 24ghante tak bina dana-pani die kaidi kii haisiyat main kothri main band rakhaa or khaanaa maangane par daroga ne unhen laathiyaan deen
 This was done in such a way that the impact of the peasant worker in the common farmers is reduced and the dominance of the landlords comes down on them

 1947 State Archives (courtesy of 'politics of Bihar Letters') 21 saal kii divya ajit kumaar ne rach diya he ek nayaa itihaas
 She has become the first female cadet in the country to receive the Army's Sword of Honor
 chennai kii officers training academy main ek samaaroh main 21 saal kii divya ajit kumaar ko sena pramukh general ve ke singh sord of honor pradaan kiya
 To get this honor, Divya had to prove her ability by competing against a total of 230 cadets
 inamen 70 mahila cadats bhi thim
 Divya, the daughter of a Chennai-based businessman, first wanted to go to civil services, but her interest in the army increased after she moved to the National Cadet Corps
 officers training academy main 49 hafte kii kadi training ke baad divya ab us mukaam par pahunchin hai, jise hasil karnaa har cadet kii harasat hoti he
 Defense officials said that Divya has also won three gold medals in studies
 unhone kaha ki divya un 70 mahila cadeton or 157 purush cadeton main shaamil hai jinhen passing out parade ke baad general singh sena main shaamil karenge
 Training of women cadets was also started in otas since 1992, after the doors of the Army opened as commissioned officers for women
 is tarah kareeb do dashak main pehali baar otia se prashikshit kisi mahila cadet ke khate main yah pratishthit sammaan gaya he
 Divya, who lives in Chennai, is a skilled dancer of Bharatanatyam
 vah basketbaal kii bhi acchhee khilaadi hai
 Divya's father Ajit Kumar is feeling proud of this achievement going to meet his daughter
 divya kii maa dina ne kaha, sord of honor milanaa kisi jimmedaari ke prati samarpan ke saath hi uski maansik shakti ko bhi darshata he
 Students of the Film Institute are opposing Gajendra Chauhan's election to the post of president because he feels that Gajendra does not deserve this post
 unka kahana he ki jis pad kii shobhaa film industry ke kai diggaj badha chuke hai us par gajendra feet nahin baithte
 But Gajendra says that the protest started with giving him responsibility
 kisi ne unhen ab tak kaam karne kaa mauka nahin diya he or unki kaabiliyat jane bagaiyr sawaal kaise kiye ja sakate hai?’ bijepi ke saath apane sambandhon par gajendra chouhan ne kaha ki raajnneeti kii apni vichaardhaara hoti he or creativity kii alag
 
 
 The two cannot be seen together
 lekin gajendra kaa kahana he ki unhen zimmedaari dene ke saath hi virodh shuru ho gaya
 No one has given them a chance to work so far and how can they be questioned without knowing their ability? On his relations with BJP, Gajendra Chauhan said that politics has its own ideology and creativity is different

 Be careful if you use whatsapp on your Android phone
 vatsaypp par baatcheet yaa kuch share karte samay khaas dhyaan rakhen
 Yes, through some hacking scripts and naughty apps, anyone can access the chat logs of your whatsapp and find out what you talk to your friends
 darasal, aisa daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki android kii suraksha kamiyon kii vajah se havers vahatsapp chat ke massej pard sakate hai
 According to Dutch Security Expert Bass Bosschart, whatsapp's database is saved on the SD card of Android phones
 is database ko koi bhi aplicoshan pard sakati he kyonki android do eps ko aapas main data share karne detaa he
 Bosschart wrote in his blog, 'whatsapp's data is saved on the SD card, which any Android application can access
 basharte ki yujar use esady card acces karne de
 Since most people allow everything to be accessed on Android devices, it is not a big deal to hack whatsapp '
 apni baat ke samarthan main boschart un steps ke bare main bhi bataate hai, jinke jariye kisi ke vatsaypp kaa data acces kiya ja saktaa he
 According to him, 'what do we need to steal someone's whatsapp database? First of all we need a place where we can place the database
 iske baad hamen ek android aplicoshan kii jarurat hogi, jo vatsaypp ke database ko website main aplod karegi'
 The Android application can be downloaded using Play Store or APK file
 aapako bataa den ki apike file android phone kii instollar file he jise alag-alag sroton se downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 When the app is installed, it asks for permission to use the network and SD card
 apni baat ko samajhane ke liye boschart ne ek web sarwar taiyaar kiya
 After this, he created an Android application that asks the user for a variety of special permits
 lekin chunki android kisi bhi aplicoshan ko phone ke kai hisse acces karne detaa he, aise main boschart kii app ko vatsaypp kaa data acces karne main koi dikkat nahin ai
 "it is clear that any application can access whatsapp's database with the help of an encrypted database," says Boschart
 vahiin, vatsapp kaa kahana he ki boschart ne apane daawey ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya he
 According to whatsapp, 'we are familiar with the news of safety lapse
 dukh kii baat yah he ki khabaron main sahi or sateek tasviir nahin dikhaai gai he
 Everything is exaggerated
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main micro esady card kaa data li nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, if the mobile user downloads a virus or corrupt site, then his phone may be in danger '
 vatsaypp ke mutabik, 'hameshaa kii tarah hamaara suzav he ki vatsaypp yujar letest sicurity cover ke liye software apadet karen or ham yugers ko is baat ke liye protsaahit karte hai ki ve acchhee or bharosemand companiyon kii websites se hi software downlod karen'
 With the strategic batting of veteran Mahela Jayawardene and captain Kumar Sangakkara, and the slick performance of the fast bowlers, Sri Lanka made a strong start to their campaign in the ICC World Cup by registering a unilateral 210-run win over weak Canada

 For Canada, Rizwan Cheema scored the highest 37 runs while for Sri Lanka, Nuwan Kulasekara and Tisara Perera took three wickets each

 The match was one-sided as expected

 kohli ne vishwa cap main adarsh gendbaaji sangyojan ke liye mangalvaar ko vanade international team main olerounder pandya kii maujuudagi ke mahatv par jor diya
 Also, Kohli hinted that some players could be tried during the series against New Zealand, raising hopes of a chance for young Shubman Gill

 If you look at the strongest teams in the world, they have at least two all-rounders, even three in a team, this gives you a lot of bowling options
 ’kohli ne kaha ki teesraa tej gendbaaj tabhi vikalp he, jab visheshgy olerounder uplabdh nahin ho
 Kohli said before the first ODI at mclean Park, "it makes sense to get down with three bowlers if a player like Vijay Shankar or Hardik doesn't play
" kyonki agar koi olerounder tej gendbaaji ke kuch over phenk detaa he to jaruri nahin ki tisare gendbaaj ke rup main aapako aise gendbaaj kii jarurat ho, jo 140 kimi pratighante kii raftaar se gendbaaji kar saktaa ho

 Whenever an all-rounder is available you do not think of a third fast bowler unless the circumstances are completely against spin bowling

 The Congress demanded a pardon from CM Vijay Rupani
 There should be a judicial inquiry and a case of treason will be prosecuted in Gujarat for the absurd question related to Mahatma Gandhi in the Class IX examination
 mahatma gandhi ke aatmahatya karne sambandhi sawaal kiye jane ko lekar gujarat ke shiksha vibhaag kii chautarafa aalochana ho rahi he
 Meanwhile, the Congress has demanded an apology from the state Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in this matter
 congress ke pravaktaa shakti singh gohil ne kaha ki yah sawaal poochna ki mahatma gandhi ne aatmahatya kaise kii, aparaadh he
 While Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse
 shakti singh gohil ne kaha ki is tarah kaa sawaal puch jane ke maamle main jaanch tak nahin kii gai
 In a letter to Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani, the Congress leader said that you are the head of the government, therefore AAP should come forward and apologize for it
 shakti singh gohil ne kaha ki sabko pataa he ki 30 janvari 1948 ko nathu ram godse ne goli markarmahatma gandhiki hatya kii thi
 Shakti Singh Gohil said that when the whole world is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, children in school in Gujarat are asked how Mahatma Gandhi had committed suicide? The objectionable remarks made against the Father of the Nation are under a conspiracy
 isaki nyaayik jaanch kii jaae or rashtradroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 In fact, a shocking question has been asked in the 9th grade internal exam in Gujarat
 sawaal he, ‘gandhiji ne aatmahatya kaise kii?’ pariksha main yah atapata sawaal puche jane kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad adhikariyon ne isaki jaanch shuru kar di he
 Not only this, a strange question was asked to the students of class 12th also, which the officers were shocked
 pariksha main chaatr-chaatraon se poocha gaya he, ‘apane ilaake main sharaab kii bikri badhane or sharaab taskaron dwaara paidaa kii jane vaali pareshaaniyon ke bare main shikaayat karte hue jila police pramukh ko ek patr likhen

 The officer said that these questions are highly objectionable, and we have launched an investigation

 The question papers were set by the management of these schools, which were run under the banner of Suflam Shala Vikas Sankul, and the State Education Department had no role in it

 In Delhi, the body of a young man missing for the last day was found on the railway line on Monday
 police kaa kahana he ki uski maut train se cat jane ke kaaran hui he
 However, the police is investigating the case
 dilli ke preet vihaar ilaake main mangalvaar kii subahrelway lineke kareeb logon ne ek laash padi hui dekhi
 Immediately this information was given to the police
 police ne maukey par pahunch kar shav kabje main le liya
 The deceased has been identified as Dilshad, a resident of Jagatpuri
 uske parivaar vaale use somvaar se hi talash kar rahe the
 They had also lodged a notice of his disappearance at the police station
 railway line par laash mili to police ne dilashaad ke parijanon se shinaakht karwaai
 The family members are in shock since he was identified
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa ki vah kin halaat main railway line par pahunchaa hoga
 Police say it could be an accident or a case of suicide
 haalaaki parijanon ne police ko bataaya he ki dilashaad kai din se depressant main tha
 The police is investigating the matter
 shav ko postmortem ke liye bheja gaya he
 There is no born wildlife scientist, forest officer, expert or naturalist
 ham main se jis kisi main bhi vanyajiwan ke prati aakarshan he, usne samay ke saath yah ruchi viksit kii he
 For most people, this journey has started as a trip to an area protected for animals
 vanyajiwan se jude paryaton ko lekar koi kuch bhi kahe, sach yahi he ki paryaton behatar sangrakshan ke liye upyogi he, jaisaa ki duniya bhar main kiya ja rahaa he
 30 November 2011: See India Today in pictures: Protected areas for tigers in India are a number of human intervention bases
 masalan, jaruri bachaav or prabandhan kaa hawala dekar van vibhaag wanon main kai tarah ke kaam karata he
 In addition, there are settlements of various villages and families within protected areas
 sadaken, railway, bijli ke taar apana jaal failaa chuke hai or jaise-jaise sarkari manjuuri milani aasaan ho rahi he, khadaanen, baandh or duusare udyog bhi pasar rahe hai
 23 November 2011: See India Today in pictures, besides tourists there are
 sangrakshan or prabandhan ke alaava, jis ekmaatr gatividhi kaa vanyajiwan ko sidhe taur par koi phayda ho saktaa he, vah paryaton he
 This helps to conserve and raise money
 paryatakon kii maujuudagi van vibhaag kii javabdehi bhi badha detii he kyonki uske sangrakshan sambandhi prayaason ke nattejey janata bhi dekh sakati he
 16 November 2011: Look at the pictures India Today has its own negative aspects
 desh ke kanoon or nitiyon kii bhoomika is nuksaan ko kam karne vaali honi chahie
 On the contrary, we are facing the threat of complete ban on tourism in many of our national parks and sanctuaries
 yah kahana ki sara paryaton alag-alag istemaal vaale bafer kshetron main kiya janaa chahie, betuka he kyonki vahaan koi vanyajiwan hota hi nahin
 09 November 2011: Look in pictures India Today i have not seen any printed data that says that day safaris in national parks and sanctuaries have any negative impact on tigers or other wildlife breeds
 baaghon ke zyada ghanatv vaale hamaare kai tiger rigerv main paryatakon kii zyada aavak he
 It has also been observed that when these areas were opened for tourism, the number of tigers here increased
 shaayad, avaidh shikaar ke khilaaf zyada sangrakshan ke kaaran
 Proper regulation of wildlife tourism is urgently needed - rules are necessary for the use of forest resources and disposal of garbage in hotels or lodges and do not disturb or interfere with wildlife movements outside the parks
 yahaan hone vaali aamadani ko sthaneey logon ke saath baantne ke tareekon ko ijad karne kii bhi jarurat he
 This question has been taken into consideration in the media debates
 ''jab sangrakshit kshetron se adivaasiyon ko visthapit kiya ja rahaa he, to paryaton ko anumati kaise di ja sakati he?'' is tark main samaj kaa puri tarah abhaav najar aata he
 Firstly, tribals cannot be displaced from protected areas without the consent of the gram sabhas as the Forest Rights Act expressly forbids this
 duusare, paryaton par roak lagane kaa adivaasiyon or anya sthaneey samudaayon par jo ekmaatr asar hoga, vah yah ki unamem se jo aamadani ke liye paryaton par nirbhar honge, ve khud ko berozegaar paaenge
 Another view is that wildlife conservationists are hypocrites, who play the 'community' card
 main adivasee adhikaron kii kaaryakarta hone kaa naatak nahin karti
 My thoughts are based on what is better for life in the forest and what is not
 safal vanyajiwan sangrakshan ke liye sthaneey sahyog jaruri he, main sthaneey samudaayon kaa samarthan karti hum, jahaan unke hit vanyajiwan ke hiton se mail khate hai
 i support the conclusion of the Wildlife Institute of India that human settlements in the core area of tiger reserves are not suitable for tigers
 ye un paryatakon se bhinn hai, jo kor ilaake ke baahar rahete hai or jinhen dopaher main kuch ghante ke liye thode se ilaake main aane kii ijaajat he
 Many conservationists are also involved with wildlife tourism, i am also one of them
 kanha rashtriya udyaan ke baahar ek tourist loj 2005 main mujhe mere pita se viraasat main mili he
 Controlled wildlife tourism is one way of conservation
 us cheez ke sangrakshan main kisi kii ruchi nahin ho sakati, jise dekhne yaa jiskaa anubhav lene kii ijaajat unhen nahin he
 The complete ban on tourism in national parks and sanctuaries would be disastrous for tigers and would be an open invitation to poachers and timber mafia

 If directors like forty-year-old Karan Johar, 43-year-old Diwakar Banerjee, 39-year-old Zoya Akhtar and 40-year-old Anurag Kashyap, sit together in a room, it is a full blown blast
 karan ne jab bataanaa shuru kiya ki unhone joya ke papa javed akhtar ko apni pehali film kuch-kuch hota he (1998) kaa tital sang likhane ke liye kis tarah se manaane kii koshish kii thi, to sabakaa hansi ke maare bura haal ho gaya
 The films that these directors have made are completely different, but to this quartet adds a passion for cinematography , which can be seen in all of the short films directed by them
 in sabhi short filmon ko ek saath milakar bombai tokies kaa hissaa banaaya gaya he
 Anurag's film is about a fan who wants to meet his idol Amitabh Bachchan
 karan kii film ke star rani mukherjee or randeep hooda aisa naakhush vivaahit joda bane hai, jinke rishte kaa imtahaan unke bich ek yuva (saaqib saleem) ke aane se hota he

 Karan, wasn't it challenging for you to make a film on a low budget? Karan: It was absolutely
 creativity to baad main aati he
 i also make my own films, so i have never seen such a sword hanging over me
 main thagi vidya se apana paisa nahin badhanaa chahta
 Briefness has not been my strength
 meri sabase choti film student of da year (2012) 2 ghante 25 minute kii he or meri sabase lambii film kabhi alavida naa kahana (2006) 3 ghante 34 minute kii he
 Each was given just 20 minutes in the Bombay Talkies
 jab contract aayaa to usamen 25 minute kaha gaya
 But we all crossed this limit and took 27 minutes
 joya: nahin
 i have kept my film for 24 minutes only
 anuraag: joya kaa ek minute maine chura liya he
 Divakar: i don't really know how long my film is
 anuraag, aapaki film kii shooting amitabh bachchan ke juhu sthit bangale pratiksha ke baahar kii gai he
 Diwakar, your film is produced in Dadar
 aap sab kis tarah kii mumbai dikhaanaa chaahate the?anuraag: main mumbai aayaa tha to juhu dekhakar dang rah gaya tha, jahaan saare star rahete the
 My film starts with Juhu and ends at Chandan, a single screen theater located five minutes away from Bachchan Sahab's bungalow
 divakar: main parel-lalbaag main rahata hum
 i have been living and working there for the last eight years
 yah ilaaka mumbai main pichley 10-15 saal main aae badlaavon ko darshata he
 The kind of music that plays in the slums, right next to my building, speaks the language of the mall, the way we dress
 maine bollywood or kuch europea bhav vaale geeton ko bajte suna he jisamen hindi or marathi sangeet bhi mil jaataa he
 Zoya: It must have seemed terrible
 divakar: yah bahut hi mjedaar he
 You should come meraa kairactor chol main rahata he jo mere offis ke saath hi he
 i still check my location every day when i get out of my office

 It is also the area of cotton mill

 It gives a brief appearance of this area
 karan: maine mumbai ko kabhi bhi nahin dikhaaya he
 This is the first time i have shot on the streets of Mumbai for the first time
 joya: meri film main mumbai kii kahani nahin he
 It is a nameless place
 yah kisi bhi jagah feet ho sakati he
 What kind of casting did you do? Anurag: Vineet Kumar (who played Amitabh Bachchan's hardcore fan) was the perfect man for the role
 karan: kya uskaa heirstil bhi unheen kii tarah tha?anuraag: sab kuch vaisaa hi
 He too belongs to the same locality (uttar Pradesh) and understands (situation) very well
 joya: meri film main kaam karne vaala baccha aath saal kaa he
 My casting director found him
 vah chillar party (2011) main bhi tha
 Is awesome anuraag: gangs of vasepur (2012) main manoj bajpeyi ke bachapan kii bhoomika bhi nibhaa chukaa he wo, or jo karan kaa hero he vah gangs of vasepur-2 (2012) kii heroin kaa bhai he
 Karan: Yes, Saqib is the brother of Salim Huma (qureshi)
 joya: agar gangs of vasepur nahin banati to hamen koi kalakaar nahin miltaa
 Diwakar: Sadashiv Amrapurkar is also there
 main to arddh satya (1983) dekhne ke baad se hi unke saath kaam karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 We have been watching cinema from the point of view of filmmakers
 yah darshakon kii najaron kaa sammaan he
 Karan: Not only in cities, but also in small towns, a large part is of people who have caught up with traditional films and want to see films of new styles, stories and better technology
 main nahin samajhataa, pichley ek arase main ek bhi acchhee film ai ho or uskaa logon par asar na hua ho
 We have stopped the growth of cinema because of our well-formed perception about the audience
 joya, filmi parivaar se hona vardaan he yaa boj?joya: aap filmi pariwaron ke bacchon se milen to ve aapako box offis se trast milenge
 We have never been able to read film magazines during our growth
 meri maa to bal kalakaar thim
 He started working in films from the age of 3
 mere dead lekhak ke rup main filmon main aae lekin ve shaayar bhi hai
 He is the author of a second period, when there were completely different ethos
 hamaare ghar main tarah-tarah ke kalakaar aate the, ghar main khulaa maahaul tha
 i am in the film industry, but for all my friends in this industry i am somewhat outsider and for all my external friends i am a child of the film industry
 lekin mere liye yah hameshaa fifty-fifty kaa maamla rahaa he
 Karan: i do not think that any child of a film family can become a dibakar or anurag
 yah mumkin nahin
 i saw their work and understood that they are not from the industry
 unhone apane pita ko punjab ke distributor se baat karte hue nahin suna hoga jaisaa maine suna he
 i used to live in a small flat and every morning when i woke up in the morning i would hear Daddy talk to that distributor in pure Punjabi
 ‘drop ho gai pichhar!” kyon? “clymex dhili he?” “second half main drop ho jaataa he
 "'collections will fall on Monday
 ” agar main divakar yaa anuraag se puuchhuun ki brallep kya hota he to ve nahin bataa paaenge
 There was a time when there was information about the distribution map of India in the same way as the political map
 aaj ke filmkaaron ko bhi darshakon ko usee tarah jaanane kii jarurat he?anuraag: main yah nahin samajhataa ki koi film kaise har jagah pahunch sakati he
 My reasoning is that today's biggest hit has been 3 Idiots (2009), called 1
 2 arab vaale is desh ke 2
 Only 5 crore people have seen it
 main sirf yahi kar saktaa hum ki aisi film par kaam karun jo flop na ho taaki agali film bana sakuun
 When my films were not being released in the country, i got a passport and took them abroad
 2004 ke pehle to mere paas passport bhi nahin tha, mujhe angreji bolni bhi nahin aati thi
 Karan: Research by FICCI Frames states that only 8 to 9 percent of the people of this country spend on cinema and we call ourselves a film-loving country
 aisa katai nahin he
 The challenge is to bring the remaining 90 per cent people to the cinema houses
 pehle kii tulana main aaj filmein bananaa aasaan ho gaya he?anuraag: main jo bhi bananaa chahta hum uske liye hameshaa khud ko aaazaad mahasoos karata rahaa hum
 It is quite easy
 mujhe kam jujhna padaa he
 Karan: Even at this time at least 1,500 talented people will be sitting at their table carrying tremendous scripts
 inamen se kitnon kii kismat anuraag or divakar jaisi hogi? kuch had tak kismat ham par meharbaan rahi he
 Diwakar: Today filming in India is easier than any other place in the world
 yah nirdeshkon ke liye acha samay he
 Tell us something about your early days of watching movies
 anuraag: hamen ek badi safed diwaar ke upar projector se film dikhaai jaati thi
 All of us children used to sit on the floor and our parents on the chairs
 is tarah kareeb 100-150 logon ne ek film dekhi
 This is how i have seen Hindi films
 hamane iske liye paisa bhi nahin diya tha
 Karan: i used to watch every Hindi film released on Friday, even films by Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani and Ketan Mehta
 gurudutt kii filmein mujhe khaastaur se prerit karti thim kyonki mujhe tregedi pasand thi
 Yash Chopra loved the glamorous world and even enjoyed it when he chose the menacing way of the wall (1975)
 divakar: bachapan main mere upar sabase zyada doordarshan kaa asar tha
 i lived in Delhi, where the International Film Festival used to take place, before it went to Goa
 mujhe kai clasik or samakaleen antarrashtriya cinema dekhne kaa mauka mila, bhale main yah nahin jaanata tha ki yah sab kya he
 Dialogue defining 100 years of cinema? Anurag: That dialogue is, "only one man can kill Gabbar, Gabbar himself (sholay, 1975)
" ” yah jivan ke har kshetra main lagu hota he
 Karan: We have been listening to a dialogue all the time, "I have a mother
 ”divakar: main sirf yahi kah saktaa hum, “tera kya hoga kaaliya? (sholay)”
 a film you wish you had made
 anuraag: main udaan (2010) ke liye aisa hameshaa mahasoos karata rahaa hum
 Karan: i never think i would have made such and such a film
 joya: sholay meri pasandida film he, beshak yahi bananaa chaahati
 Diwakar: i wanted to make Shekhar Kapoor's Bandit Queen (1994)
 anuraag: bandit queen (1994) na bani hoti to ram gopal verma satya (1998) bhi nahin bana pate

 From the beginning, Bigg Boss house has been divided into two factions
 ek group siddharth shukla kaa he or doosraa group paras chhabda kaa he
 In such a situation, it is not wrong to say that both the contestants are very strong
 jahaan ek taraf paras ko big bos ke ghar main apane group ke sadasyon se pyaar mil rahaa he to vahinsiddharth shuklako big bos ke ghar ke baahar se bhi kaaphi saport mil rahaa he
 Now many times the contestant of the house has been seen targeting Siddharth Shukla

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Nitish Kumar was very much aware of the NDA alliance's victory in these Lok Sabha elections
 lekin jis tarah ke nattejey aae unhone nitish ko bhi chaunkaa diya hoga
 Although there was a lot going on inside, but the experts of politics and elections also remained unaware of this internal commotion
 is halchal ko ve visheshgy bhi bhaanp nahin paae jinhone janata dal (united) or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke rajg gathbandhan kii behtareen jeet kii bhavishyavaanee pehle hi kar rakhi thi
 Now after the results are coming, Nitish's wear is being spoken all around
 or aisa ho bhi kyon na
 He has changed the election results in a very dramatic way
 agar thodaa peeche jaakar dekhen to 1999 main rajg ne rajya main 30 siten jiti thim lekin aaj dashak bhar baad unhone rajya main 32 siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya he
 The JD (U) and BJP alliance have cleared the sweep of other parties in Bihar
 is uplabdhi par nitish ne kaha ki janata ne unke rajnatik pratidwandviyon lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan kii 'nakaaratmak raajnneeti' ko sire se nakaar diya he
 He says, "this is the positive vote that has been given to peace and development
" hamane bihar main jo kaam kiya he, janata ne uske liye hamen vot dekar jitayaa he
 "nitish Kumar is completely opposite to Lalu Prasad's 'divide and rule' politics
 unhone apana dhyaan sabko saath lekar chalane kii raajnneeti par kendrit kiya
 And no one could question it because counting day was his day
 unki nai soch or vikaas aadhaarit prachaar ke drushtikon ne lalu prasad or paswan ke apane pehle jaise chamatkaar ko dohraane ke armaanon par pani pher diya
 If seen, there were many factors which led to a big victory for the NDA in Bihar under Nitish Kumar
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki nitish ne apni pahchaan kii raajnneeti ko bahut hi shandaar dhang se ekikrut drushtikon or vikaas ke mudde ke saath jod kar jeet kaa formula taiyaar kiya
 Not only this, they also increased their problems by putting up strong candidates against Lalu Prasad and Paswan
 lekin 2009 ke ye aam chunaav sirf vijetaon ke liye hi nahin jane jaaenge
 Rather, those who have lost have made more headlines
 vishleshan karne par maaloom hota he ki bihar loksabhaa chunaav se jinhen sabase zyada nuksaan hua he ve lalu or paswan hai
 However, RJD chief and Paswan contested the elections together like in 2004
 lekin pichhali baar donon ko jahaan 26 siten haath lageen thim vahiin is baar unhen jabardast haar kaa swaad chakhnaa padaa
 These were the same leaders who did not understand even taking congress opinion in pre-election ticket distribution
 donon hi diggaj ummid kar rahe the ki unka jatigat sameekaran is baar phir rang laaegaa
 During the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the vote percentage of these two parties together with the Congress was 45 percent
 isse inaki ummiden badi hui thim
 Now Nitish says on the crushing defeat of lalu-paswan, "their mathematics went awry and both failed
 '' in chunaavon ko lalu-paswan ek duswapn kii tarah hameshaa yaad rakhenge
 Even if there was a caste wave, he worked in favor of Nitish because he had put a sweet layer of his development slogan on it
 dekha jaae to lalu prasad ne saaran loksabhaa seat bachaakar apni saakh kuch had tak bachaa lee, kyonki patliputra seat par hui haar se unke saamne kai prashn paidaa ho gaye hai
 At the same time, Ram Vilas Paswan of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) was not so lucky
 ve apana garh maani jane vaali hajipur sansadeey seat se jad (you) ke ram sundar das ke haathon haar gaye
 Till now, these two former Union ministers who have dominated the political landscape of Bihar have reached the abyss
 isi ko kehete hai jor kaa jhatka laganaa, yani 40 loksabhaa siton main se rajd-lojpa gathbandhan ke hathe lageen to sirf 4 siten
 Worse, LJP could not even open its account in Bihar
 rajya main ek or rujhaan dekhne ko mila
 That is that the voters here have also defeated Bahubali politics
 rajya ke chaar bahubaliyon kii patniyaan chunaav maidan main thim lekin koi bhi jeet darj nahin kar saki
 Heena Shahab, wife of jailed RJD MP Shahabuddin, was in the fray from Siwan, who was defeated by Independent candidate Om Prakash Yadav
 pappu yadav kii patni ranjita ranjan to supaul main jad (you) ke vishwa mohan kumaar se haar gayi
 Ranjita was contesting on a Congress ticket
 ve chunaav se kuch samay pehle hi congress main shaamil hui thim
 Pappu Yadav's mother Shanti has lost to Priya Purnia
 isi tarah lojpa saansad surajbhaan singh kii patni vinaa devi ko bhaajapa ke bholaa singh ne navada main shikast di to congress ummidavaar or purv saansad anand mohan kii patni lavali anand shivahar se haar gayi
 Besides Lalu and Paswan, the losing Union ministers include Mohammad Ali Ashraf Fatmi, Shakeel Ahmed, Kanti Singh, Raghunath Jha, Akhilesh Prasad Singh, Taslimuddin and Jayaprakash Narayan Yadav
 shakeel ahamed ke alaava sabhi rajd se hai
 However Union Minister Meira Kumar (congress) Sasaram and Union Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh (RJD) have won from Vaishali
 yahaan mjedaar baat yah rahi ki jahaan lalu kii bataur rail mantri jamkar tarif hui or rail sudhaaron ke chalate unhen antarrashtriya str par pahchaan mili vahiin ve sthaneey str par apane logon ko aakarshith karne main asafal rahe
 Lalu continued to make polarization assessments but forgot to listen to what his own people were saying
 gathbandhan banane ke dauraan unhone congress kii bhi puri tarah se andekhi kii
 Due to this, the Congress got a large number of votes in many Lok Sabha constituencies which were fatal for lalu-paswan
 congress ke saath gathbandhan na karne kii apni galati ko lalu ne mana bhi
 Speaking to the media, he said, "it was a big mistake for us not to include Congress in the coalition
" isi ke chalate vot bant gaye
 "on the other hand, JD (U) will definitely have some thinking due to Congress victory on Kishanganj seat
 yah seat jad (you) ne is baar bhaajapa se lekar ladi thi
 But this time, the victory of the Congress in this minority Bahul region on its own is bound to force Nitish's muscle
 yahaan yah jaruri ho jaataa he ki sushasan babu is baat ko yaad rakhen ki uttar pradesh main khud ko majboot karne ke baad congress kaa aglaa nishaanaa bihar hi hoga
 The results of Bihar election can be seen to have a special impact on the issue of electricity, roads and water, which has washed away the possibilities of caste polarization
 yahi nahin, prachaar ke dauraan bhi lalu-paswan ko is baat kaa katai ehsaas nahin hua ki janata unhen is tarah khaarij kar degi
 Nitish's development politics had many flaws, but Lalu and Paswan could not catch them
 lalu nitish kii kai morchon par asafalataa ko ujagar karne ke bajaae dharmanirpekshata ke mudde ko hi uthaate rahe jo bihar ke matadaataaon ke liye kam mahatv rakhata tha
 "in many cases, the public is tired of unsuccessful promises," says a Congress leader
 lalu-paswan ise bhunaane main asafal rahe
 "if we look at the neighboring state of Jharkhand, then the BJP had nothing to lose because it did not have any MP from the state in the 14th Lok Sabha
 lekin 2009 ke is chunaav main bhaajapa ne 8 siten jeet leen
 So Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) finished second while RJD, which won two seats in the previous state, could not even open its account
 haalanki, bhaajapa jharkhand main 1999 sareekhee safalataa dohraane kii ummid kar rahi thi, jab isane centre main rajg sarkaar banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 At that time BJP had won 11 out of 14 seats
 rajya main haarane vaale diggajon main ek naam kendriya mantri rameshwar oraanv kaa bhi he
 He had to face defeat at Lohardaga seat
 jharkhand main bhaajapa kii jeet to hui hi he lekin yahaan ke chaaron purv mukhyamantri bhi apni-apni siton par jeet darj karne main safal rahe hai
 When the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand State Babu Lal Marandi (jharkhand Vikas morcha-hajjatantrik) succeeded in winning the Koderma Lok Sabha seat, the second Chief Minister of the state, Arjun Munda, won the Jamshedpur seat on a BJP ticket
 bharat ke sabase lambey samay tak nirdaleey mukhyamantri banane kaa gaurav hasil karne vaale madhu kodaa ne bhi singhbhum seat ko jeet liya
 Shibu Soren of JMM also won his traditional Dumka seat
 yahi nahin, sorain jamtada vidhansabha seat ke liye hue upachunaav main bhi vijayi rahe hai
 The win will certainly provide some relief to the badly battered Soren
 udhar, jharkhand vidhansabha ke purv adhyaksh inder singh namdhari ne bhi chatra seat jeet lee he
 He won the election as an independent candidate
 namdhari ne nitish kumaar se vidroh kar rajd main shaamil hue purv kendriya mantri naagamani ko dhul chataayee
 If seen, the complete division of UPA votes and disillusionment with the UPA coalition of people made the BJP silver in Jharkhand
 iske saath hi rajg jharkhand main puri tarah se ekajute rahaa jabaki upie main yahaan daraar paidaa ho gai thi jiskaa phayda rajg ko mila
 Anyway, Jharkhand has been considered a BJP stronghold since the time of undivided Bihar
 udhar, ek baar phir bihar par lauten to lalu-paswan ko agle vidhansabha chunaav par najar rakhte hue taiyaariyaan shuru kar deni chahie kyonki ab zyada samay nahin bachaa he or nuksaan kaaphi ho chukaa he
 While lalu-paswan has to bring back his mass base, it is also important to keep in mind that in this period of development and progress, he can maintain his existence
 is chunaav prachaar main haar kaa sabak shaayad unhen badalane kaa paath padhaa jaae
 The Modi government's decision on Article 370 has divided the Congress into two factions
 milind devda, deependra hooda, aditi singh samet kai congressi netaa faisle ke saath hai
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad is angry with this rebellion by Congress leaders
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki jin logon ko jammu-kashmir or congress kaa itihaas nahin pataa he, un logon se mujhe koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He first read the history of Kashmir and Congress, then stayed in Congress
 kashmir se achaanak anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa faisla lekar modi sarkaar ne congress kii mushkil badha di he
 Even though the Congress has opposed this move of the Modi government in Parliament, but there is confusion about it within the party
 congress ne jammu-kashmir ke mudde par congress varking cameti kii baithak bulaai he
 The meeting will be completed at the party's headquarters in Delhi
 sutron ke mutabik sadasyon ko abhi meeting kii timming nahin bataai gai he
 Party members have been told that a party meeting can be called at any time after the parliamentary proceedings are over
 congress ke bheetar hi anuchhed 370 ko lekar matbhed he
 Several Congressmen including Milind Deora, Deepender Hooda, Aditi Singh have supported the change in Article 370
 # WATCH: GN Azad, when asked that some leaders of the party are supporting abrogation of # Article370, says "jin logon ko J&K ki history ya Congress ki history pata nahi unse mujhe koi lena dena nahi hai
 Wo pehle J&K aur Congress ki history padh lein, phir Congress mein rahein

 kahani:yah kahani ek retile gaanv se shuru hoti he, jahaan par divyang (netraheen) hedu (sanjay mishra) naamak bujurg apane bete mukund (bhupesh singh), bahu parvati (tilottama shom) or do potiyaan pihu or kuhu ke saath rahete hai
 Due to the barren land in the village, the farmer of the village takes the loan, but due to the failure of the crop, he appears to be unable to repay the loan with interest
 is vajah se kisaanon kii aatmahatya ek aam baat ban chuki he
 Gunu Babu (ranveer Shorey) does the job of collecting loan money from farmers
 kabhi kuch kisaan paise de dete hai to kabhi kuch anakani karte hai, jis vajah se gunu chintit bhi rahata he
 People there call him as Yamdoot
 isi bich gunu kii mulaakaat hedu se hoti he or dhire-dhire hedu ek khaas shart par gunu kii madad karata he
 Effect of 'bitter wind': People of the village who are suffering from drought are suffering from drought, although Gungunu is a resident of Odisha, where his wife and children live, but he lives in this village in connection with work and Wants his wife to come to this village with him very soon
 ab kya gunu kaa parivaar gaanv main aa paata he? aakhirkaar hedu ne aisi kya shart rakhi thi jisaki vajah se kahani main bahut sara ulatpher hota he, yah sab jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why watch the film: The story of the film is quite interesting
 yah satya ghatnaon par aadhaarit he
 Neela has kept the film's locations very interesting, which is quite raw and seems fully capable of telling the ground reality
 film kii likhaawat kaaphi shandaar he or cinemetography umdaa he jo ki aapako har tareeke ke imoshan se lete hue aage badhati he
 The film's direction is very good and the screen play is also well written
 Review: 50 ke dashak kaa gaanv or theatre play dekhne waalon ko pasand aegi panchalatsanjay mishra ne dil ko chhu lene vaala kaam is film main kiya he or unke abhinay ko dekhte hue lagata he ki rashtriya puraskaar agar unhen mili to kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie
 He shakes you up completely in terms of acting
 pita putr ke rishte ko bhi bahut hi achche tareeke se sanjay mishra ne bhupesh singh ke saath nibhaayaa he
 Actress Tillottama, who plays the daughter-in-law, has done a good job
 ranvir shori kaa abhinay bhi umdaa he
 The work of the rest of the actors of the film is also effortless
 mujeec acha he
 The background score moves along with the story
 aakhir main aane vaali gulzaar sahab kii panktiyaan dil ko chhu jaati hai
 The biggest thing is that the film is called a big thing about the change in the weather and the trend of the winds and eventually the figures are forced to think
 Review: dil chhu jaataa he 'tumhaari sulu' main vidya baalan kaa 'hello'box-offis:film kaa bajet 10 karod rupee se kam bataaya ja rahaa he
 Not every section may reach the theater to see it, but the film will be fortunate if Word of Mouth makes it even more a matter of discussion

 The Indian cricket team, after recovering from a disappointing tour of Australia, will try to maintain this winning rhythm against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup league match on Friday and Sachin Tendulkar will also be desperate to end the pressure of his 100th international century
 australia ke teen maheene se zyada samay ke hatashapurna daure ke baad bharat ko is up mahadwipiya toornament main jaisi shuruyaat kii jarurat thi, usne srilanka par 50 ran kii jeet se waisi hi shuruyaat kii
 The batsmen of the team performed poorly on the Australian soil, but they looked comfortable in the familiar sub-continental atmosphere and got plenty of runs to support their bowlers, although their bowlers initially lost a few runs on an unhelpful pitch
 lekin tendulkar kii samasya khatm nahin ho rahi he
 The 38-year-old star cricketer has made almost all international records to his name, but he has not been able to make hundreds in the last one year
 tendulkar kii dridhtaa kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vah buudhvaar ko vaikalpik net satr main bhi abhyaas karne pahunche, jisamen bharat kii 15 sadasyeey team ke keval teen sadsy hi shaamil the
 Tendulkar has not been able to score a century in the last 33 innings, which is just one innings short of his longest dry spell
 tippaniyan Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli have continued their superb ODI form in Australia till this tournament and both have proved it with their 10th international century against Sri Lanka
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ko bhi paristhitiyon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila, jinhone srilanka ke khilaaf nichle kram main utarkar 46 ran kii romaanchak pari kheli
 Suresh Raina also seems to be recovering from Australia's disappointment in the conditions of the batsmen here
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki manoj tiwari ko yahaan khilne kaa mauka miltaa he yaa nahin jinhen australia main ek bhi vanade main nahin khilaayaa gaya tha
 There is a boost in the confidence of bowling fast bowler Irfan Pathan, who took four wickets against Sri Lanka and this is a good sign for India
 lekin gendbaaji akraman se mukhya gendbaaj kii gaiyr maujuudagi se gendbaajon ko ballebaajon par bhi nirbhar hona hoga ki ve bada score banaaen
 After a desperate tour of Australia for more than three months, India needed a start in this sub-continental tournament, beginning with a 50-run win over Sri Lanka
 team ke ballebaajon kaa australian sarajameen par pradarshan kaaphi lachar rahaa, lekin ve parichit up mahadwipiya maahaul main kaaphi sahaj dikhaai die or apane gendbaajon ke sahyog ke liye kaaphi ran batore, haalanki unke gendbaajon ne gaiyr madadgaar pich par shuru main kuch ran ganvaa die
 But Tendulkar's problem is not ending
 38 varshiya is star cricketer ne kareeb sabhi antarrashtriya record apane naam kiye hai, lekin vah pichley ek saal se saikadaa nahin jad sakaa he
 Tendulkar's tenacity can also be gauged from the fact that he also came to practice in the optional net session on Wednesday, which included only three members of India's 15-man squad
 tendulkar pichhali 33 pariyon main shatak nahin laga sake hai, jo unke sabase lambey sookhe spel se keval ek pari kam he
 The comments gautam gambhir or viraat kohli ne australia main apni shandaar ekadivasiy form ko is toornament tak jari rakhaa he or donon ne srilanka ke khilaaf apane 10wein antarrashtriya shatak se ise sabit bhi kiya
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also got a chance to understand the circumstances, who played a thrilling 46-run knock against Sri Lanka in the lower order
 suresh raina bhi lag rahaa he ki yahaan ke ballebaajon ke mufeed halaat main australia kii niraashaa se ubar rahe hai
 It will be interesting to see if Manoj Tiwari gets a chance to play here, who was not fed in a single ODI in Australia
 gendbaaji main vaapasi karne vaale tej gendbaaj irfan pathan ke aatmavishvaas main badhotaree hui he, jinhone srilanka ke khilaaf chaar wicket chatkaaye or yah bharat ke liye acha sanket he
 But due to the absence of the main bowler from the bowling attack, the bowlers will also have to depend on the batsmen to make a big score

 Similarly, he managed to become Chief Minister, leaving behind veteran leader Parasram Madrena, able leader Chandanmal Vaid and better option than himself Girija Vyas

 For three years he kept crying that the government has no money

 His claim of exceptional drought relief and free distribution of wheat has affected the people of the state as well as people from outside

 But with elections coming, many people realized that many of their promises like drought relief payments were never actually implemented

 The result of the politics of hollow promises has also been bad for them many times

 badakismati se khud joshi mahaj ek vot se chunaav haar gaye or ab jaakar rajasthan hycourt ne us chunaav ko hi avaidh tehra diya he
 It would have been good for the party that Joshi would have been made the chief minister and he would have been contesting from another assembly seat
 par gahalot or dilli main unki samarthak lobby ne aisa nahin hone diya
 Gehlot also managed to show the fear that if he was removed, the weak Congress government of the state would fall
 sachaai yah thi ki unhone bispi ke chah vidhayakon ko mantri or sansadeey sachiv jaise pad dekar bahumat jutaya tha
 Gehlot is bringing the party in place of Joshi through Chandrabhan and running the government like a private estate
 unhone tamaam nikaayon main aise vafaadaar niyukt kiye hai, jinamein se zyaadaatar naakaabil hai
 Sonia Gandhi saved Gehlot himself last year
 par ab ve yah baat samaj chuki hai ki rajasthan main agar haar hui to isaki puri jimmedaari khud un par hi hogi
 In the process of party brainstorming, Joshi as well as Union ministers Jitendra Singh, Sachin Pilot, Rajasthan PWD Minister Bharat Singh are taking advice from leaders such as how to save the party from drowning

 He will be the first President of the United States to receive this honor and visit India twice during his tenure
 saki ne kaha, beshak, hamaare aarthik sambandh mahatvapurn he, jise ham aage jari rakhana chaahate hai
 However, Saki warned the allies and partner countries that this was not the right time for Ukraine to maintain a pre-existing relationship with Russia during its intervention
 unhone kaha ki america ko yah jaankaree praapt hui he ki bharat or rus ne tel khoj, aadharbhoot sanrachanaon, raksha or parmaanu urja ke kshetra main samjhaute kiye hai
 "we will keep an equal watch on this, but we have not seen the details of all agreements," the spokesperson said
 lekin ham sabhi deshon se lagaataar anurodh karenge ki ve rus ke saath pehle jaise sambandh na rakhen
 He said sanctions have been imposed against Russia, imposed by the US and its Western allies
 saki ne kaha, saamaanya rup se maujuuda sthiti ke anusaar sambandh saamaanya gati se nahin chalane chahie
 Did America tell Indian officials before Putin's visit that this is not the right time to maintain relations with Russia as before
 saki ne kaha, ham us mudde par charchaa kar rahe the
 i would like to remind you that India does not support Russia's intervening activity in Ukraine and has also been very vocal on this issue

 But despite two and a half months of convincing from the Rawat faction, Bahuguna has to appeal to the mlas for the seat of choice, yet is unable to decide a single seat for himself
 sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon ke mutabik bahuguna ko 13 sitambar tak, yani chah maheene ke bheetar vidhanmandal ke liye chunaa janaa jaruri he
 Half a dozen seats in the state have been discussed for Bahuguna so far, but if there is no talk, then the MLA is not ready to vacate the seat
 bahuguna apni tehri sansadeey seat se baahar jane kaa saahas nahin juta paa rahe or yahaan kii 14 vidhansabha siton main se pasand kii ek seat khaali karaane main unhen pasinaa chhot rahaa he
 After the success of breaking the BJP MLA Kiran Mandal elected from Sitarganj seat in Udham Singh Nagar district, it is believed that the Chief Minister will contest the by-election from this seat
 lekin party kii andruni charchaa main bahuguna ne abhi tak vahaan se ladane main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai he
 Speaking to India Today, State Congress President and Senior Minister Yashpal Arya says, "mandal and local Congressmen who want to leave the legislature want, the Chief Minister should contest from here
 ''makapa rajya sachiv vijay ravat ke netritv main 29 may kii shaam bengaaliyon ke jameen sambandhi adhikaar ke mudde par mukhyamantri se mili pratinidhimandal kaa daawa he ki bahuguna sitarganj se chunaav ladenge
 But Bahuguna's choice remains Gangotri and Tehri assembly seats
 tehri se dinesh dhanai nirdaleey vidhayak hai, jo mantri na banaae jane se aahat hai
 The selection of seats for Bahuguna is not easy, as only a section of Congress can try to defeat him, as former BJP Chief Minister B

 Happened with Khanduri
 khandudi ke maidan main utarane se bhi muqabla kathin ho saktaa he
 However, on contesting elections against the Chief Minister, Khanduri says, "there is nothing in the Congress right now
" congress ke elaan or party main vichaar ke baad hi main kuch tay karuunga
 However, in view of political turmoil, the Congress high command has postponed the election of the new state president and filling up one vacant cabinet seat till Bahuguna by-election
 rajya ke prabharee congress mahasachiv choudhary birendra singh kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri ko khud hi nirnay lenaa he ki ve kahaan se ladenge
 They will fight the BJP or any MLA of their party by vacating the seat, we have left the decision in this regard only
 '' vaise bahuguna kii pasand kii gangotri seat se congress ke vijaypal singh sajwan vidhayak hai
 But Sajwan is not willing to give up the seat without reliance on rehabilitation
 gangotri par mukhyamantri ke jor kii khaas vajah yah he ki seat unke loksabhaa kshetra kaa hissaa to he hi, yahaan rajya ke duusare bade netaaon kaa dakhal bhi kam he
 On this seat, the Chief Minister is also looking forward to the support of UKD (P) Pritam Singh Panwar, who is an MLA from the adjacent seat Yamunotri and a minister in the government
 sutron ke mutabik, dhanai ke seat chhodane se inkaar karne ke baad congress ne sahaspur se bhaajapa vidhayak sahadev singh pundir par dore daale, lekin baat nahin bani
 Raipur seat was discussed, but do not consider Bahuguna to see the difference of victory of Congress MLA Umesh Sharma by just 474 votes

 Now many Congress leaders are emphasizing on Sitarganj, from where mlas who have left the legislature have become 'kiran' for Bengali voters
 mandal kii shart ke mutabik, bahuguna cabinet ne hathonhaath rajkeey grant act ke tahat jameen kii manjuuri bhi de di
 Bahuguna's rally in Sitarganj on June 3 may have some important announcements, which are being linked to his candidature
 is seat par mandal se pehle do baar se basapa ke narayan paal jitate aae hai
 Mandal's margin of victory on this seat was also 12,612 votes
 agar basapa ummidavaar nahin utaare or khandudi mukaable main na utren, to bahuguna ke liye sameekaran behatar ho sakate hai
 BJP general secretary in-charge of Uttarakhand Thawarchand Gehlot says, "BJP will field strong candidates
 kaaryakartaaon kii bhaavana he ki khandudun laden lekin faisla kendriya chunaav samiti karegi
 It is evident that Bahuguna, who is heavy on veterans like Harish Rawat, Satpal Maharaj, is now looking for a single seat to save the Chief Minister's chair

 Sinha had said in his article that Jaitley started as the luckiest finance minister in the post-liberalization era
 crude oil kii kam keemton ne karodon rupee bachaae
 This explosion should have been used with imagination
 lekin, kai saare project ruke rahe aurbainkon kaa enpie samasya bana rahaa
 All these should have been managed better like the bumper reduction in crude oil prices
 lekin kachche tel kii tarah ise ganvaa diya gaya

 purv vittamantri ne apane lekh main kaha ki pichley do dashakon ke mukaable nijee nivesh ghatata gaya he
 Industrial production has collapsed
 krishi kaa sankat badhata gaya he
 The construction industry is at the forefront of employment
 sarvice sector main mandi aa gai he
 Exports have dried up
 sector dar sector arthvyavastha kii haalat kharaab he
 In the midst of all this, demonetisation became a disaster for the economy
 saath dahi jaldbaaji main lagu kiye gaye jiesti ne bijness ko dubo diya
 Millions of people lost their jobs
 rojgaar ke nae maukey nahin ban rahe hai

 sinha ne apane lekh main teesraa sawaal jidipi ke timahi dar timahi lagaataar girane kaa uthaaya he
 GDP fell to 5 in the first quarter of the current financial year
 7 fisad par aa gai he
 Which is the lowest in the last three years
 sarkaar lagaataar kah rahi he ki iske liye notebandi jimmedaar nahin he
 Yashwant Sinha has written that the government is right, demonetisation is not responsible for this, the decline in GDP started long ago
 notebandi ne to bas main aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
