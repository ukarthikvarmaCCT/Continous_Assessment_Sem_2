 ye shabd hamaare hai, lekin bol yaa aap kahie kathani or kerani sabake lakshan aapako bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke kriyakalapon main mil jaaenge
 Manjhi will not accept this in the new year, but through his decisions, through his steps, he is making everyone feel that Nitish Kumar, who had made him the chief minister's chair, has been by-gone
 unki nitiyaan, unke chahete adhikari or unki mahatvakankshi pariyojnaon ko vah thikaane lagane main lag gaye hai
 The Patna High Court's decision comes against the party, but Manjhi not only welcomes that decision by defending his party and the government, but speaking out also gives a statement that the Speaker's decision was wrong
 baaki kasar maanjhi ne us samay nikaal di, jab unhone adhikariyon ke tabadale main nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane jane vaale chanchal kumaar ko chalata kar diya
 Everyone knows that while Chanchal may not be very popular with politicians and officials, he is close to Nitish Kumar's heart, whether it is a new museum project in Patna or a convention center in Patna
 
 unke jane kaa matlab saaf he ki maanjhi in pariyojnaon ko kisi na kisi bahaane lataka hi nahin denge, balki koi na koi jaanch bhi nitish ko gherne ke liye jald shuru karvaa den to koi aashcharya nahin
 Everybody close to Manjhi in Bihar and who understands the power game knows that in the coming days Manjhi will be targeted by Bihar's power department's suffix Amrit
 agar maanjhi unhen hataane main safal ho gaye to samaj lijie bihar main gaanv-gaanv bijli pahunchane kii nitish kumaar kii ghoshnaa bhi adhar main rah jaaegi, lekin nitish kumaar ke kattar samarthak bhi maanate hai ki aisa hoga to maanjhi kuch galat nahin karenge, balki vah apni bhavishya kii raajnneeti kii script ke anusaar nitish kumaar ko haashiye par dhakel rahe hai
 Whose mistake is it in Nitish Kumar, who made a fool of giving Manjhi the chair, but Khamiyaja will not only pick up Nitish Kumar but also who has given his favor over Lalu Yadav Manjhi, also pay the price of this closeness with Manjhi Will happen
 wo kya hoga, kisi ko nahin maaloom, lekin lalu agar maanjhi ke in kadamon par apni maun sahmati dete rahe to nishchit rup se nitish kaa vishwaas unke upar adhik to nahin kam jarur hoga or saath hi mahagathbandhan kii yojana bhi dhari kii dhari rah jaaegi
 Yes, BJP leaders must be enjoying among them all, but when your good days are going on, in such a situation there is a stampede in the house of your opponents

 The Supreme Court has termed the Kalikho bridge government in Arunachal Pradesh as unconstitutional

 After this, Budhwar Sham Nabam Tuki again took over as Chief Minister
 supreme court ne kaha he ki rajya main 15 disambar 2015 se pehle kii sthiti behaal hogi
 This means that the Congress government in the state will be restored
 kyonki usase pehle rajya main congress kii sarkaar thi or nabam tuki rajya ke mukhyamantri the
 The special thing is that a five-member bench of the Supreme Court has given this decision and all the five members were unanimous about this decision
 supreme court ne kaha he kirajyapalka samay se pehle vidhansabha satr bulaane kaa faisla, uski puri prakriya asanvaidhanik thi
 According to the Supreme Court, the Governor has abused his powers
 bataa den ki isse pehle uttarakhand main bhi supreme court ke dakhal ke baad congress kii sarkaar behaal hui thi
 This is the second setback for the central government
 farvari main bani thi nai sarkaaraisi saal kai maheenon ke raajnneetik sankat ke baad arunachal pradesh main bijepi ke sahyog se congress ke baagi netakalikho pulne rajya ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee thi
 Kalikho Pul had the support of 19 rebel mlas of Congress and 11 BJP mlas and two Independents from outside
 rajya main 60 vidhansabha siten hai
 The political crisis that began in the state last year, tell us that the constitutional crisis in the state started last year when 21 of the 47 mlas of the then Congress government in the 60-member Arunachal Assembly (two of them Independents) of their own party and Chief Minister Rebellion against
 maamla nabam tuki or unke kattar pratidwandi kalikho pul ke bich he

 bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne kaha he ki karnataka main netritv parivartan nahin hoga
 Gadkari said that there is no question of removing Sasanand Gowda from the Chief Minister's post
 gadakari karnataka ke purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ke us bayaan par tippanee kii, jisamen unhone karnataka main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar ultimatum diya tha

 duusari ore party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne unke uttaradhikari sadanand gauda ko mukhyamantri pad se hataane se inkaar kar diya
 Yeddyurappa had to resign as Chief Minister after being accused by the Lokayukta in an illegal mining case about six months ago
 unhone party adhyaksh ke saamne spasht kar diya he ki ab vah or adhik intjaar nahin kar sakate
 Before the bjp's 'chintan Manthan' meeting, Gadkari met Yeddyurappa on Friday morning and separately met Chief Minister Sadananda Gowda in an attempt to iron out differences
 sutron ne bataaya ki yediurppa apane rukh par kaayam hai or chaahate hai ki gauda ko hataaya jaae
 When Yeddyurappa resigned after being accused in a corruption case by the Karnataka Lokayukta, he introduced Gowda himself as his successor
 ab gauda yediurppa ke kathith prabhaav se baahar aa chuke hai
 The central leadership does not want to split the party in Karnataka and hence every effort is being made to pacify Yeddyurappa
 jab unhen mukhyamantri pad se hatane ko kaha gaya tha tab do kendriya netaaon arun jetali or em venkaiya naidu ko yah mudda paraspar sahmati se sulajhane kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 What will be the outcome of the current crisis cannot be said as the central leadership does not want to reassign Yeddyurappa to the reins

 Yeddyurappa has made Jagdish Shettar, once considered an enemy, his friend, Rural Development and Panchayat Minister, and this is also a cause for concern for the party leadership
 apane awaas par guuruuvaar ko hui ek baithak main yediurppa ne apane samarthakon se khud ko ek baar phir mukhyamantri banane ke liye party netritv par dabaav banane kaa aahvaan kiya
 Yeddyurappa, who is going to be 70 years old on February 27, has invited all the supporting legislators to the banquet ceremony held on that day

 Actually one of the most expensive lawyers in the country Ram Jethmalani to fight against Arvind Kejriwal in defamation case made by Arun Jaitley
 8 karod rupee kaa bill thamaya he
 Kejriwal wants this fee to be given from the Delhi government fund, which has been disputed
 kejariwal kii daleel he ki ye unka nijee maamla nahin he to bill wo apni jeb se kyon bharen
 But in October last year, Arvind Kejriwal had described the matter as his personal matter before the court

 Kejriwal had applied for the closure of the case, but the court refused to dismiss the case and in his order, declared both cases to be private

 58 rupees per liter, which is its highest level till date, while petrol prices 73
 73 rupee prati litre par pahunch gai, jo iskaa chaar saal kaa ucchstar he
 In such a situation, the pressure on the government to cut excise has increased once again
 saarvajanik kshetra kii petroleum companiyaan pichley saal june se dainik aadhaar par eendhan keemton main sanshodhan kar rahi hai
 According to the price notification, the prices of Azpatrol and Diesel in Delhi were increased by 18 paise per liter
 dilli main ab petrol 73
 73 has been raised to Rs 73 per liter, before that on September 14, 2014, the price of petrol was 76
 06 rupee prati litre ke ucchstar par pahunchi thi
 Diesel price 64
 58 rupee prati litre ke apane sarvakalik ucchstar par pahunch gaya he
 Earlier on February 7, 2018, diesel sold 64
 22 rupee prati litre kaa ucchstar chuaa tha
 The Petroleum Ministry had demanded an excise duty cut on petrol and diesel in view of rising international crude oil prices, but Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ignored this demand in the budget on February 1
 dakshin asian deshon main bharat main petrol or dijal kii khudara keemat sabase adhik he

 november, 2014 janvari, 2016 ke dauraan vaishvik str par tel keemton main giravat ke baavjood vitt mantri jetali ne utpaada shulk main 9 baar badhotaree kii he
 Only once in October last year was it reduced by two rupees a liter
 utpaada shulk main katautee ke baad centre ne rajyon se moolyavardhit kar (waite) ghataane ko kaha tha, lekin maharashtra, gujarat, madhya pradesh or himachal pradesh ne hi aisa kiya tha
 Other states, including bjp-ruled states, did not heed this request of the Center

 At that time, the price of petrol in Delhi 70
 88 rupee litre or dijal kaa 59
 14 was a liter
 utpaada shulk katautee ke baad 4 aktubar, 2017 ko dijal 56

 kuch der ke liye hi sahi, par jab insaan apana hosh kho baithta he to behosh ho jaataa he
 This is the time when our brain does not get enough oxygen
 haalanki behosh ho janaa kisi khatarnaak beemaari kaa suchak ho ye jaruri nahin, lekin aapke liye yah jaananaa bahut jaruri he ki behosh hone ke kya-kya sambhavit kaaran ho sakate hai
 Most studies suggest that people have the most vasovagal attacks
 jisamen achaanak se heart rate yaa phir blad pressure kaa str gir jaataa he
 This attack occurs mostly to children and people who have completed the age of 35 years
 agar aapke saamne koi achaanak se behosh hokar gir pade to sabase pehle use khule main le jaaen
 In most cases, people stand around the unconscious person, but doing so can also be dangerous
 khuli jagah par le jane ke baad uske chehre par pani ke chhinte daalen
 Give him some water to drink as well so that his breath comes back to normal level
 agar iske baavjood marij ko aaraam na ho to use turant doctor ke paas lekar jaaen
 These 5 reasons can be behind unconsciousness: 1
 dil kii dhadakanon kaa aniyamit honadil kii dhadakanon ke aniyamit ho jane kii vajah se zyaadaatar log behoshee kaa shikaar ban jate hai
 When blood is not circulated in a normal flow to the brain, such a situation arises
 agar samay rahete is samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin kiya jaae to dil kaa daura padane kii naubat bhi aa sakati he
 Sometimes this situation arises due to the clotting of blood too
 2
 It may be the symptoms of getting pregnant, sometimes even during pregnancy, there is unconsciousness
 agar aap apane garbh dhaaran karne ko lekar aashwast hon to turant se pregnancy test kar len
 If you want, you can do pregnancy test at home and if you want you can also go to hospital
 3
 Due to empty stomach, many times we go out of the house without eating or drinking anything
 jiske kuch der tak to hamaara sharir sphurtivan bana rahata he lekin dhire-dhire uski takat khatm hone lag jaati he or kamajori mahasoos hona shuru ho jaataa he
 Many times, due to this reason, i get dizzy
 4
 Being very emotional, sometimes due to very happiness, sometimes due to very sad, the balance of the body also gets disturbed
 bhavuk hone kii sthiti main blad pressure achaanak se bad jaataa he or teji se pasinaa chhootane lagata he
 In such a situation the possibility of becoming unconscious increases
 5
 Stress situation can also be dangerous
 On the one hand, due to hypertension, while many diseases occur, this condition can also cause unconsciousness
 iske alaava blad pressure kii samasya hone kii vajah se bhi behoshee aa jaati he

 " Film Name: Mantodirector: Nandita Dasstar Cast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Rasika Duggal, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Rishi Kapoor, Divya Dutta, Ranveer Shourie, Neeraj Kabi, Javed Akhtar Duration: 1 hour 56 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 3
 5 stallbhinetri or nirdeshak nandita das kii filmon kaa chayan hameshaa se hi bahut hatakar rahaa he
 He ventured into the world of direction with the film Firaq
 is baar nandita ne urdu shaayar or namchin shakhsiyat saadat hasan manto ke jivan ke upar film banane kaa prayaas kiya he or acchhee research ke saath unke jivan ke chaar saal ko nandita ne darshane kii koshish kii he, jisamen navazuddin siddiki lead role main dikhaai dene vaale hai, aaie jaanate hai kisi bani he yah film -kahani:-film kii kahani 1946 ke bombai (ab mumbai) se shuru hoti he jahaan urdu shaayar or riter saadat hasan manto (navazuddin siddiki) apni patni safia (rasika duggal) or beti nidhi ke saath rahata he, manto kaa khyaal hameshaa se hi sabase judaa he, jisaki vajah se kabhi uski film ke produsar (rishi kapur) se jirah ho jaati he to kabhi film industry ke doston ke saath anban ho jaaya karti he
 Not only this, they are also different from the friends of the writer group like Ismat Chughtai (rajshri Deshpande), there is a case of spreading vulgarity in Lahore through writing over Ismat and Manto, while India and Pakistan are divided
 Goes, causing Manto, who loves Bombay, to split up with his friend and superstar Shyam (tahir Raj Bhasin) and move to Pakistan
 pakistan main manto ko apane likhe gaye thanda gosht kahani ke liye cese jhelana padataa he or antat kahani main kuch twist aate hai jinhe jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Why can we watch the film? The story and manner of portraying it is very interesting, the 40s have been shown by Nandita Das keeping in mind the small things along with the equipment and costumes used at that time
 nandita ne manto ke jivan ke sirf chaar saalon ko lagbhag 2 ghante kii is film main darshaya he, jisamen manto kii soch or rahan-sahan ke dhang ko bakhubi dekha ja saktaa he
 Those who know about Manto will find this film very good, however for those who do not know about it, this film is also served as a perfect biopic, where nothing is presented in excess
 
 abhinay ke lihaaj se navazuddin siddiki ne manto kaa kirdaar behtareen dhang se nibhaayaa he or unhen dekhakar lagata he kii aakhirkaar manto kaa mizaaj kaisaa rahaa hoga
 While Rasika Duggal has done a great job as Manto's wife, Tahir Raj Bhasin has done a smooth job
 film main manto kii kahaniyon ko kirdaaron ke madhyam se bhi dikhaaya gaya he jisamen divya datta, ranvir shori, rishi kapur, javed akhtar, niraj kabi jaise abhinayta dikhaai dete hai
 The background score of the film is good and those who like the works of Saadat Ali Manto, or who want to know about his life, must watch this film

 UIDAI ne aadhaar maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan nagarikon ke data kii suraksha ko lekar supreme court main zordaar daleelein di he
 UIDAI stated that the Aadhaar law is competent and strong
 saath hi court se yah apil kii ki is maamle main court doctor jaisaa ravaiya apanaae yani marij kaa ilaaj karte hue is yojana ko majboot banane ke upaay bataae na ki is yojana ko khatm karne kii baat kare
 During the hearing of the case, it was said on behalf of UIDAI that the right to privacy is not absolute in itself
 ise bhi baaki moulik adhikaron kii tarah hi simit karnaa hoga yani is par bhi pratibandh lagu ho saktaa he
 Not only this, the right to privacy also has to be aligned with other civil rights
 aadhaar act ke uddeshy ke liye ahm he ki kitni soochna janata se lee ja rahi he? in tamaam tathyon ko nyaayik rup se parakhnaa hoga
 Under the Aadhaar law, UIDAI does not have the right to know for which particular reason the authentication of Aadhaar number has taken place
 kor bieometric jaankaree ham saajha kar hi nahin sakate
 We have also punished them for sharing information with Airtel and Axis Bank
 UIDAI ne IT act kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki agar koi vyakti data li karata he, to jis vyakti kii jaankaree li hui he, uske liye muaavje kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 The court treats the Aadhaar case like a doctor, who focuses on curing his patients how to cure the patients? How to save the patient
 adaalat ko bataanaa chahie ki aadhaar act main or kya-kya sudhaar karnaa chahie, na ki isko khatm karnaa chahie
 UIDAI said before the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court that the Aadhaar law is very strong
 yah data ulanghan ke khilaaf uchit or paryaapt suraksha muhaiyaa karaata he
 During the hearing of the case, Justice Chandrachud, a member of the bench asked, what is the security in the Aadhaar Act? Has any criminal action or punishment been arranged in case of data security rule violation? Dwivedi said that it is wrong that UIDAI is collecting and storing personal information in 'meta data'
 unhone kaha ki aadhaar kanoon ke tahat aapraadhik cese kiya jaataa he or soochna praudyogiki adhinium ke tahat sajaa di jaati he
 He said that the Justice Srikrishna Committee is working on a law that would ensure the security of data and at the same time balance the rights of an individual
 meta-data main yah sunishchit karne ke liye liye adwitiya divaais code he ki pramanikaran agency nirdhaarit maanakon ke anuroop he
 No sharing of biometric data is possible, as it is encrypted and stored in the store after the data is registered
 unhone sahmati vyakt kii ki teji se takneekee pragati data kii suraksha main chunautiyaan pesh kar rahi he
 Hence Srikrishna Committee is considering to put in place a strong data protection law for this
 unhone kaha kiadharasmaj ke garib or vanchit virgon ko jivan jeene or rashtriya str par sweekaarya pahchaan detaa he
 Aadhaar gives them pride, dignity and self-respect
 saath hi yah ehsaas dilaataa he ki ve samaaj kaa hissaa hai
 Dwivedi said that the purpose of this law is to ensure adequate food at affordable prices, so that people can live with dignity and live life
 yah samaaj ke haashie vaale virgon ke saamaajik or aarthik adhikaron ke ekikaran ko sunishchit karata he

 The latest case was the spokesperson of the State Congress Committee
 ke
 Mishra, who was recently removed from the post
 party kii andruni khabaron ke mutabik mishra bhaajapa hi nahin, kuch congressi netaaon ke liye bhi pareshaani kaa sabab the
 It is being said that those who had unannounced alliance between Kamal and Paws had problems in the business due to Mishra
 yahi vajah rahi ki pehle to mishra ko pravaktaa hote hue bhi patrakaron se baat na karne kii hidaayat di gai, jab ve nahin maane to indore ke is netaa ko rivaan sambhag main pravaktaa niyukt kar diya gaya
 Mishra is believed to have exposed some stories of the generosity of the BJP government along with top party leaders
 nateeja yah rahaa ki unhen pradesh congress pravaktaa ke pad se chalata kar diya gaya
 In a letter written to remove Mishra, State Congress President Kantilal Bhuria said that 'at the moment Congress needs your activism, you are inactive
 ' haalanki bhuriya party ke andar chal rahi gutbaji se inkaar karte hai, unhone kaha, 'ye khabaren niraadhaar hai
 As far as Mishra is concerned, state media incharge Manak Aggarwal reports every month
 unhone inaki report 'nil' di he
 Based on this, he was relieved
 'vahiin mishra ne apni pratikriya kuch is tarah di, 'yah unke visheshadhikaar kaa maamla he

 Earlier, the Congress had issued guidelines for 12 spokespersons of the state level, saying that they should not issue any statement without the permission of state president Bhuria and media department chairman Manak Aggarwal
 iske saath hi unhen yah hidaayat bhi di gai thi ki ve bhaajapa ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh akhriyaar karen
 On the condition of anonymity, a spokesperson said, "when the statement has to be issued with permission, then how can there be an aggressive attitude?" 'mana ja rahaa he ki kai netaa in disha-nirdeshon ke khilaaf hai
 But no one wants to speak openly
 sabhi ko dar he ki agar munh kholaa to use pad se fouran hataa diya jayega
 The reason for issuing these instructions is that the spokesmen raised such cases against the BJP government due to which the equations of some Congress leaders and the government were deteriorating
 vahiin party adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki kai baar pravaktaaon ke bayaan se party kii kirakiri ho jaati he
 It is better that if we talk with permission, then the party can provide more information in that matter

 Captain Kapil Dev, who gave India the first Cricket World Cup, said on Wednesday that how the current captain Virat Kohli will use the clever mind of former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the upcoming Champions Trophy depends on them
 champiens trophy ek june se england main shuru ho rahi he or 18 june tak chalegi
 India is entering this championship as the current winner
 2013 main dhoni kii captaini main hi bharat ne yah khitaab hasil kiya tha
 This time India will come under the captaincy of Kohli
 kapil kaa maananaa he ki yah puri tarah se kohli par nirbhar he ki vah kis tarah dhoni ke anubhav kaa istemaal karte hai
 Kapil told IANS in a talk organized by Star Sports, "it is up to Kohli how he uses the experience of the former captain
 main nahin maanata hum ki dhoni us tarah ke insaan hai, jo lagaataar bich main dakhal denge
 It will be up to Kohli how he uses Dhoni best
 " Kapil described Dhoni as a true all-rounder
 unhone kaha ki sirf balle or gend se pradarshan karnaa hi harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii pahchaan nahin hoti balki wicketcaping or ballebaaji bhi isamen shaamil he
 He said, "don't forget Dhoni, he is a true all-rounder
 harfanmaulaa khilaadi kii kaabiliyat sirf balle or gend kii nahin hoti balki wicketcaping or ballebaaji kii bhi hoti he
 "he is a very important player at number five and six", the world-winning captain said
 kapil ne ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja ko shandaar harfanmaulaa khilaadi bataaya he or donon kii jamkar prashansa kii
 He said, "comparing someone is quite difficult
 aswin or jadeja ne hamaare samay ke khilaadiyon se kai behatar kaam kiya he
 We have to be confident in his abilities as he has proved himself and performed well
 " India will start the Champions Trophy on June 4 against arch-rivals Pakistan
 kapil se jab poocha gaya ki is match kaa bharat par dabaav hoga to unhone kaha, "main nahin maanata ki bharat par dabaav hoga
 If i am batting against Pakistan, it doesn't matter what our track record is
 " unhone kaha, "main gend ko uski merit ke hisaab se kheloongaa
 It is correct for the media to talk, but when the player goes on the field, he does not think that way
 vah sirf jeetna chaahate hai
 " england kii paristhitiyaan tej gendbaajon ke paksh main hai
 Kapil says bowlers will have to concentrate more on swinging the ball and avoid more variations
 unhone kaha, "gendbaajon ko apni line length par gend kerani hogi jo kaaphi mahatvapurn hoga
 In England you don't need to do much, just focus on swinging the ball
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki ballebaaj kaisaa he agar aap gend ko swing kara sakate hai to aap us par haaavee rahenge
 " (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 He said that i do not think we have enough time
 main ravivaar ko dilli ja rahaa hum

 There is also a lot of pressure to play for the IPL team
 kehete hai ki vikaas ke saath-saath aparaadhiyon kii najar bhi dastak dene lagati he
 Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh has a similar situation
 is shahar main apharan kii dastak se praparty ke kaarobaar se jude logon main dehshat paidaa ho gai he
 Rajesh Jain, a 50-year-old businessman, got about 42 lakhs two years ago
 main kharidi gai saat acre jameen ke liye baahar se aae ek kharidaar ne jab kareeb do karod ru
 Offered nothing unusual to him
 ve is anjaan shaks se sauda kar paisa lene indore ja pahunche
 When he was kidnapped at the tip of the revolver in his car there, he realized that this boom in the price of land is also a cause of trouble
 rajesh ko police kii tatparta se teen din baad hi bina phiroti die reeha kara liya gaya lekin is ghatana kaa dar kaarobaariyon main saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Pramod Puri, an alcohol-trader who is active in the sale and purchase of land, says, "this incident has made everyone worried
 ab anjaan logon se deal karne se pehle 10 baar sochenge
 This was the first serious incident of kidnapping for ransom in a crime-ridden Nimar zone
 police adheekshak manoj sharma bhi is baat kii pushti karte hai, ''is anchal main is tarah ke aparaadhon kaa itihaas nahin he, shaayad yahi vajah bhi he ki yahaan ke log apni suraksha ko lekar zyada chaukas nahin hai
 "actually, the story of this whole deal is like this
 17 agast ko shahar ke hotel ranjit main di
 s
 solanki naamak ek vyakti aakar rukaa
 He described himself as the manager of the Highways Authority of India and met Rajesh to buy land through local brokers Rajesh Parikh and Shyam Soni
 usne rajesh kii kareeb 7 acre jameen kaa sauda 28 lakh ru
 Fixed at the rate of per acre
 lekin solanki ke saath company ke veluvar ke rup main aae raju shrivastav ne rajesh ko bataaya ki company use 42 lakh ru
 The rate will be paid by check and the difference will be returned to them in cash
 in logon ne rajesh se kaha ki final deal indore main ruke unke bade afasar karenge
 So they have to come there
 rajesh kehete hai, ''aam taur par yahaan saude aise hi hote hai isliye mujhe kuch gadabad nahin laga
 On 24 August, Rajesh reached the Radisson Hotel in Indore with both local brokers and his partner Santosh Jain
 vahaan solanki or shrivastav ne pement karne ke bahaane rajesh ko alag kar unka apharan kar liya or unke parijanon se 5 karod ru
 Asked for a ransom parijanon ne khandwa city kotwali main agyaat apartaaon ke viruddh praathmiki darj karwaai
 Indore Range Inspector General of Police Vipin Maheshwari and Khandwa Superintendent of Police jointly chalked out a strategy
 jaanch ke baad iske peeche uttar pradesh ke khoonkhaar bhadauria giroh kaa naam aayaa
 On August 28, police raided a house in Firozabad, Haryana and recovered Rajesh
 police ne mukhya aaropee sudhir bhadauria, onkaar singh, pradeep chouhan or mohammad inaam ko giraftaar kiya he
 AK-47, 6 pistols, 5 hand grenades and a large number of ammunition were recovered from them
 ab yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki khandwa kyon nishane par aayaa
 Sunil Kala, who is associated with the property business, says, "only after the Indira Sagar Dam and Omkareshwar Dam have been built in Khandwa for a decade, the price of land has increased tremendously
 ek to in baandhon kii vajah se 249 gaanvon ko milakar kheti or jangal kii 2,28,370 acre jameen dub main aane se bachi, vahiin bade rakabe ke sinchit hone se jameen kii keemat main khaasaa oochaal aayaa
 "this happened after the Tawa dam was built in Hoshangabad district
 jile ke bhitari ilaakon main jo jameen 30-35,000 ru
 Acre was also not sold, its price has increased 10 to 15 times
 yahi vajah he ki indore ke bade niveshkon ne bade paimaane par yahaan jameen kharidi he
 Between the opening of a thermal power station and the preparation of another station, this district is also being seen as the power hub of the future
 vahiin ek badi bhoomika sthaneey dallalon ne bhi nibhaai he jinhone niveshkon ko vikaas ke sapane sarkaar se bhi zyada dikhaae hai
 The number two of the entire money is lost in the land, so even businessmen take more interest in it
 police kii poochtacha main apartaaon ne bhi bataaya ki jameen ke kaarobaar main do number kaa paisa laga hota he, isliye logon kii jeb dhili karaane main zyada mashkkat nahin hoti
 Businesses are becoming easy victims even in their desire to become millionaires overnight
 vahiin hidaayaton ke baavjood shahar ke bade hotel bhi suraksha ke maanak nahin apanaate
 However, people are relieved due to the arrest of Rajesh's kidnappers, but a fear has also passed

 But Aamir turned down this role
 iske peeche kya vajah rahi iskaa khulaasa ab khud aamir khan ne kiya he
 Speaking to the media, Aamir Khan said, "I was offered the role of Sunil Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's film Sanju"

 "when Aamir Khan spent the night under the statues of Mahatma Gandhi in the riots, the actor said," Rajkumar Hirani brought the script to me and i liked it
 ve chaahate the main sunil dutt sahab kii bhoomika nibhaauun or yah ek shandaar bhoomika thi
 It is a father-son story, but Sanju's role is tremendous
 ek kalakaar ke rup main maine raju se kaha, sanjay dutt kii bhoomika bahut shandaar he or isane meraa dil jeet liya he
 So i can't play any other role in the film except Sanjay Dutt, which i couldn't do because Ranbir Kapoor is doing it
 "SANJU: hoobahoo sanjay kii copy lag rahe hai ranbir, ye 12 tasviren sabutafilm 'sanju' main lead role nibhaa rahe ranbir kapur par aamir khan ko puraa bharosa he
 He believes that Ranbir is an excellent artist and he is confident that he would have performed brilliantly in the film

 ham chaahate hai ki log yahaan apni alag raay or aasthaa share karne main surakshit mahasoos karen
 But when it comes to hate speech, mental harassment or trying to suppress another's voice, we have kept it quite different

 Former Railway Minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad said in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on the Demands for Grants of Railways for the year 2012-13 that the trader of the country wants to send his goods via rail

 This forces them to send their goods via road transport

 For this, railways will have to improve their freight system

 Referring to the huge misfortune in getting ticket reservation for railway passengers, he alleged that the main reason for this is the large-scale 'forgery'

 bangladesh kii shuruyaat bhi acchhee nahin rahi
 In the inaugural match against England, he lost by eight wickets despite scoring a huge total of 305 for six with Tamim Iqbal's century

 He said, "we were unable to take wickets in the middle overs against England, which led to our loss

 kathua cond or unnav cond par pradhanmantri narendra mod ke chuppi saadhane par neuyork times ne tikhi pratikriya di he
 On Tuesday, the US newspaper The New York Times wrote in an editorial that similar and similar violent incidents in India are part of 'an organized and organized campaign by nationalist forces' to intimidate women, Muslims and Dalits
 'modij long silence age women aar atacked' sheershak ke sampadakeey main neuyark times ne yaad dilaayaa ki kaise modi lagaataar twit karte hai or khud ko ek pratibhashali vaktaa maanate hai
 Despite this, the US newspaper said that despite this, PM Modi loses his voice when women and minorities are constantly faced with threats by nationalist and communal forces
 rashtravaadi or sampradayik takatein unki bhartiya janata party kaa aadhaar hai
 The newspaper also referred to the statement made by Modi on this matter on Friday, in which he said that these cases of misdeeds have brought shame to the country and our daughters will surely get justice
 modi kii tippanee puri tarah khokhliah neuyork timesnuyark times ne kaha ki unka yah bayaan khokhla jaisaa he, kyonki isamen unhone kaaphi der lagaai or inkaa vishisht ullekh karne ke bajaae ek saamaanya rup se ise yah kahkar vyakt kiya ki beete do dinon main jin ghatnaon kii charchaa ho rahi he
 The newspaper has accused Prime Minister Modi of adopting a similar attitude earlier
 isse pehle neuyork times ne modi par aarope lagaaya tha ki unke raajnneetik abhiyaan se jude gaurakshak samooh ne gaayon kii hatya karne ke jhuthe aarope lagaakar muslim or daliton par hamale kiye or hatya kii
 Modi did not say anything about the accused BJP MLA: Newspaper murder and rape of a girl allegedly by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh There is a protest haalanki pradhanmantri ne in aparaadhon or anya maamalon main shaamil kathith bijepi sadasyon ke bare main kuch nahin kaha he
 He also did not say anything about the BJP MLA accused of Unnao case of Uttar Pradesh
 akhbaar ne kaha ki modi kii chuppi na sirf hairaan karne vaali he, balki pareshaan karne vaali bhi he
 The American newspaper got reminded of the Nirbhaya case
 The American newspaper also reminded the Nirbhaya incident of 2012, which was not reacted strongly by the then Congress government and had to bear the brunt of it
 akhbaar ne likhaa ki lagata he ki modi ne saal 2012 ke nirbhaya cond se sabak nahin liya
 The BJP won the election in a big way , because Modi promised to give Indians a more accountable government after the then UPA government, which was surrounded by corruption, but instead developed a method of silence and attention-grabbing
 , Which is very worrying for anyone who is concerned about the health of the world's largest democracy
 akhbaar ne kaha- sabhi tabakon kii suraksha karen piem modinuyork times ke apane sampadakeey main kaha ki modi se yah apeksha nahin kii ja sakati ki unka samarthan karne vaale ke dwaara kiye gaye har aparaadh par wo bole hin, lekin hinsa ke yah maamle koi alag-thalag or apavaadit nahin hai
 They are part of an organized and planned campaign of nationalist forces, aimed at terrorizing women, Muslims, Dalits and other disadvantaged sections
 akhbaar ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa kartavya he ki sabhi logon kii suraksha karen or unke liye laden, na ki sirf unke liye jo unase raajnneetik rup se jude hai
 Shiv Sena said that being a citizen of India, Baba Ramdev has every right to join politics
 haalanki party ne kaha ki vah anshan ko raajnneetik hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal karne kii samarthak nahin he
 The party's remarks came in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana'
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah congress netaaon kii kal kii is tippanee kaa jawaab he ki baba ramdev ko yoga tak hi simit rahanaa chahie
 The editorial states, "if a foreigner, Sonia Gandhi can become the 'political godmother' of Congress leaders, then why can't Ramdev join politics as a citizen of this country
" ’ haalanki akhbaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki bhrashtachar anshan or ‘shankh bajaane’ se nahin khatm ho saktaa
 The newspaper writes, 'the solution is to overthrow the corrupt government and instead bring a clean image, transparent and public government
 ’ isamen samprag sarkaar ke is tark kii bhi aalochana kii gai he ki ramdev ke paas ramlila maidan main anshan kii anumati nahin thi
 The newspaper has said, 'if this was the case, then why did the senior minister of the UPA government convince Baba not to go on hunger strike
 ’ sampadakeey main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ramdev swayan bhi is puure ghatnakram ke liye jimmedaar hai kyonki unhen anna hajaare ke safal anshan ke kuch hi saptaah baad doosraa anshan shuru karne kii jarurat nahin thi
 The government got majority by the grace of Shri Ram - Acharya Dharmendrabole - this issue should not have gone to the Supreme court
agenda Aaj Tak, while talking on the issue of Ram temple, the leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Shri Acharya Dharmendra said that Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas is an authentic and Trusted trust
 ram mandir ke liye desh ke andar urja jagaane kaa kaam isi nyaas ne kiya
 Therefore, there is no question of making anyone else a partner in the trust while trust
 unhone aage kaha, 'pehle to yah mudda supreme court main janaa hi nahin chahie tha
 The government got majority by the grace of Shri Ram
 satta ke sheersh par baithe logon kaa pehle udghosh hota tha- yah to abhi jhaanki he, kaashi-mathura baaki he
 Therefore, there was no need for a separate trust
 'vahiin samvidhan kaa zikr karte hue acharya dharmendra ne kaha ki agar is desh ko dharmanirpeksh samvidhan mila he to wo hinduon kaa banaaya hua he
 He said that the temple to be built in Ayodhya will be grand
 jo puure vishwa ke paryatakon ke liye aashcharya kaa centre banegaa
 At the same time, on the order of the Supreme Court to create a government trust, Kishore Kunal, author of the book IPS and Ayodhya Revisited, said that the trust constitutes the greatest authority of Ram Janmabhoomi but it has a legal bottleneck
 janvari 2019 ke baad jis trust kaa gathan he usee ko yah adhikaar diya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the legal trust cannot be made a partner in this trust
 lekin is nyaas main jo log hai unhen milakar trust kaa gathan hona chahie
 Rama's behavior is renunciation, so whoever is associated with him should work with this spirit

 Expressing confidence in the Central Government, he said that i sincerely hope that the Central Government will also conduct a judicial inquiry into the Batla House encounter and will take appropriate steps in the ongoing violence against North Indians in Maharashtra

 The England openers beat Australian bowling fiercely and 17

 congress bachaao raily main rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi or priyanka gadhi ne garajte hue mahila suraksha, mahangaai, berogari or kisaanon ke mudde centre sarkaar ko gheraa
 Rahul Gandhi refused to apologize, showing his attitude

 On this, BJP leader Giriraj retorted, saying that there is no Gandhi by taking the surname of borrowing
 giriraaj singh ne twit kar kaha, vir saavarkar to sachche deshbhakt the
 There is no Gandhi, no patriot, by taking the surname of credit
 deshbhakt hone ke liye ragon main shuddh hindustani khun chahie
 Many people have robbed India of disguise, now it will not happen

 - Input from IANS congress ke varisht netaa siddharmaiya (siddaramaiah) kii ek aapattijanak tippanee se vivaad ho gaya he jo ki paroksh rup se purvavarti gathbandhan sarkaar main unki party ke sahyogi dal jades ko nishaanaa banaakar kii gai thi
 However, Siddaramaiah later claimed that he used a common Kannada adage and was referring to the BJP
 misuru ke periyapatna main shuukravaar shaam main jab samvaadadaataaon ne poocha ki congress
 
 jades sarkaar ke girane ke liye jades ke netaa un par aarope kyon laga rahe hai, siddharmaiya (siddaramaiah) ne ek kannada kahawat kaa istemaal kiya jiskaa shabdic arth he ki ‘‘nrity karne main asamarth ek veshya ne farsh ko asmaan bataaya
 JDS was angered by this comment
 jades ke rashtriya mahasachiv evam pravaktaa ramesh babu ne kaha ki yah siddharmaiya kii niraashaa ko pratibimbit karti he
 The BJP also condemned Siddaramaiah's remarks, saying it reflected the party's culture
 vivaad badhane par siddharmaiya ne shanivaar ko kaha ki vah bhartiya janata party kaa ullekh kar rahe the
 Siddaramaiah said that the Kannada adage he used is very common among the people
 bhaajapa pravaktaa es prakaash ne kaha, ‘‘ek purv mukhyamantri hote hue, unhone jis bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya vah atyant anuchit or bahut nimna str kii he
 This is the culture of Siddaramaiah and his party
 ''shanivaar ko siddharmaiya ne dakshin kannada jile ke dharmasthala main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘main bhaajapa kaa ullekh kar rahaa tha
 This is a very common saying used in the areas around Mysuru
 jo log sarkaar nahin chalaa paye unhone sthitiyon ko vipareet bataaya
 "babu said targeting him," Siddaramaiah's statement reflects his conduct
 koi netaa yadi apni bhashaa par niyantran kho detaa he, yah uski kuntha dikhaata he
 "he tweeted," JDS is like a paradise for those who love him
 yadi koi uske khilaaf bolta he to use koi fark nahin padataa
 It is a fact that both the Congress and the JDS danced together during the coalition government

 Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha said on Sunday that i did not even have the ability to become a compounder but i worked as a health minister
 yahaan chal rahe brahmaputra sahitya mahotsav main deepa choudhary ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan sinha ne kaha, main to compounder banane kii bhi kaabiliyat nahin rakhata tha lekin maine desh ke swasthya mantri ke taur par kaam kiya
 Sinha mentioned that his elder brother was a doctor
 unhone bharat ke logon ko unhen pyaar or sammaan dene ke liye unka shukriya adaa kiya or bataaya ki tab vah bombay koi star banane ke liye nahin balki sangharsh karne or ek abhinayta banane ke liye gayi the
 Talking about his biography Anything But Silent, Huesinha said that it is the most honest and transparent book written on one's life
 diggaj abhinayta ne kaha, yah kitaab sabase adhik bikne vaali kitaab ban gai he
 There is no sensation in it
 kitaab main kisi mahila kaa anadar nahin kiya gaya he
 Sinha recalls an era when some people advised him to undergo plastic surgery on his face to look beautiful but when veteran actor Dev Anand stopped him from doing so, he decided against it
 unhone kaha, dev sahab ne mujhase kaha tha, aisa mat karo, jaise ho vaise bane raho
 Then i told the world that i should be accepted as i am
 maine apane chehre, pratibha or vyaktitv ko nikhaarane kaa kaam kiya
 Sinha said, i want to suggest to today's youth whether to be better than the best or to prove themselves to be different from the best
 khamosh shabd main ruukhaapan kaa bhav he lekin aaj yah ek pyaara shabd ban gaya he
 It depends on how you say it
 dusron kii nakal nahin karen or apni bhoomika nibhaaen
 On the question of joining politics, Sinha said that he did this because of his obligation to society because he wanted to do something for the society
 unhone kaha, reel life main staradam ke shikhar se vaastavik jivan main sabase nichle str kii ore janaa aasaan nahin hota
 Then you have to face ridicule, neglect, reproach and repression
 agar aap inhen paar kar jate hai tab aapkaa junun sammaan ke liye aapkaa maargdarshan karegaa
