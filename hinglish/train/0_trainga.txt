 Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has said that Rahul Gandhi should be ashamed for politicizing the surgical strike
 rajasthan ke balotra main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue amit shah ne congress adhyaksh ko jamkar khari khoti sunai
 Let me tell you that Congress President Rahul had said that during Manmohan Singh's tenure, India had made three surgical strikes on Pakistan, but had never beaten it like PM Modi
 shame karen rahul- shahbijapi adhyaksh ne kaha ki sarkaar ne to uri main shahid hue sainikon kii shahadat kaa badla liya tha, lekin uttar pradesh ke chunaav se jodakar rahul gandhi uskaa raajnneetikaran kar rahen he, desh ke shaheedon kii veerta kaa apmaan karne par rahul gandhi ko shame aani chahie
 Addressing the people amidst modi-modi slogan, Amit Shah said, "pakistan sent 10 intruders, burnt 12 of our jawans alive
" 
 
 puraa desh main gussa, hataasha or niraashaa kaa maahaul tha, lekin is baar mauni baba manmohan kii sarkaar nahin thi, aapaki banaai narendra modi kii sarkaar thi
 "amit Shah said that on the tenth day, PM Modi ordered the army and the army entered Pakistan and took a surgical strike to avenge the martyrdom of the soldiers
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki is par aap logon ko bhale hi khushi ho rahi ho lekin rahul gandhi kah rahe the ki upi kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye hi sarkaar ne sargical strike kiya
 Amit Shah said that Rahal should be ashamed of this statement
 sargical strike ko raajnneetik sampatti main badla- rahulaisase pehle rajasthan ke udaipur main congress adhyaksh ne kaarobaariyon se mulaakaat kii or pradhanmantri narendra modi par sargical strike ko raajnneeti mudda banane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Rahul said that the Prime Minister, while entering into the jurisdiction of the army, converted his surgical strike into political assets, when in reality it was a military decision
 rahul ne kaha ki upie ke kaarykaal main jab manmohan singh piem the to sena ne 3 baar sargical strike kii lekin congress kii sarkaar ne kabhi sargical strike kaa shrey nahin liya
 Rahul said that when the BJP was defeated in the Uttar Pradesh elections, Modi turned a military decision into a political asset
 congress adhyaksh ne kaarobaariyon se kaha, 'narendra modi sarkaar jaisi sargical strike manmohan sarkaar ne bhi teen baar kii

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) started his Lok Sabha election campaign from Meerut on Thursday
 isi kram main jammu (jammu Rally) main unhone ek raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Addressing the rally, the Prime Minister said, 'I am fortunate that when i have come out to seek blessings from all over the country for the 2019 elections, on the first day i have received the blessings of Mother Vaishno Devi
 ' unhone kaha, 'dogron kii shauryagatha or ham bhaajapa ke logon kii ragon main daud rahi premnath dogra ji kii tyaag or tapasya hamen nai sphurti de rahi he
 On 11 April, when you press the button of the EVM in front of the lotus flower, its voice will create panic among the terrorists and their comrades within the country and will also hear its echo across the border
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue piem modi ne kaha, 'mujhe samaj nahin aata ki kya ye vahi congress he, jisamen rahakar netaji subhash chandra bose ne aaazaad bharat kii kalpana kii thi
 Those who run the cross-border terror factory are in awe today
 pehali baar aisa hua he ki seemaa paar bharat ko dahalane ke liye aane vaale aatanki bhi aaj 100 baar soch rahe hai
 The whole country is talking in one voice and one voice today, but Congress leaders are singing the same tone
 balakot main air strike ke baad congress ke netaa aisi baat kar rahe hai, jo bharat ke paksh main nahin he
 Not only this, the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir are also talking that is not acceptable to the people living in the village
 'meerut ke baad rudrapur main bole piem modi- paak ke hero banane waalon ko maafee nahinunhone kaha, 'aaj aatanki or aatank ke sarparast ye dua maang rahe hai ki kuch bhi ho jaae
 But get rid of the watchman somehow and they sit in the great Delhi
 lekin kya desh ko ye manjuur he? congress ke namdaar ke guru jo congress kii niti nirdhaarit karte hai wo bina laaj-shame, hindustan kii dharti par media ke saamne aatankiyon ko clin chit de rahe hai
 When the Guru will be like this, what will the disciples be like and how will the disciples be? 'PM Modi said- i have been hearing since the age of 8 that the Congress is removing poverty, but poverty is not there
 Taking a dig at Kashmir parties National Conference and PDP also said, "what happened two or three days ago is more shameful
" neshnal conference ke ek ummidavaar dwaara anaap shanaap bayaan baaji kii gai ye puure desh ne dekha he
 The country is also seeing how the Congress has joined hands with these people
 kya congress kaa haath aise hi logon ke saath he jo bharat ke khilaaf bolen? jammu kashmir kii sthiti jo aaj he iske liye congress, neshnal conference or pidipi jimmedaar hai
 Due to these Kashmiri Pandits had to suffer so much
 aatankwaad kaa jo jehar ghulaa he uske jimmedaar bhi yahi log hai
 These are the people who never trusted the power of India
 inke paas bade or kade faisle lene ki himmat hi nahin he
 These are dead people

 jahaan tak bharat kii baat he, log ab surakshit yon-sambandh ke prati zyada satark hue hai
 Yet there is a lack of awareness in some areas
 ek survey main yah paaya gaya ki urisa main 37 fisadi se adhik ladakiyon kii shaadi 18 saal se pehle tathaa 13 fisadi ladakon kii shaadi 21 saal se pehle ho jaati he

 If we talk about developed country America, then the situation there is different
 america main varsh 2009 main kishoriyon dwaara shishu ko janm dene kii dar sabase nichle str par pahunch gayi, lekin yah dar viksit deshon ke bich sabase oonchi hi bani rahi
 According to a report released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the US, 410,000 teenagers aged 15 to 19 gave birth in the US in 2009, ie 39 out of 1000 gave birth
 is report ke anusaar kishoriyon main janmadar 20 saal pehle kii janm dar se 37 pratishat ghati he
 Twenty years ago, it was 61 of 1,000 adolescent girls giving birth
 8 thi
 According to another report released by the National Center for Health Statistics in early February, the rate of childbirth of adolescent girls has come down
 sidisi ke adhyayan ke mutabik america main kishoriyon ke janm dene kii dar main giravat yah pradarshit karata he ki america main younachaar main sakriy kishor-kishoriyon kaa pratishat kam hua he
 The state-run telecom company BSNL has released two new offers to woo its customers
 ye ophers company ke pre-ped graahakon ke liye he
 For pre-paid users, BSNL has withdrawn two offers of Rs 249 and Rs 429
 ye ophers pramotional ophers hai
 In bsnl's Rs 249 plan, customers will be given 1 GB data per day with a validity of 28 days
 yani graahakon ko 28GB data praapt hoga
 Customers can also make BSNL to BSNL unlimited calls in this combo plan
 graahak is ofer kaa phayda keval 25 oktober 2017 tak hi uthaa sakate hai
 Keep in mind that customers will only get 3G / 2G speed, as the company does not have a 4G network
 iske alaava BSNL ne 429 rupee vaala bhi ek plan launch kiya he, iskaa plan kaa muqabla privet companiyon ke 399 rupee vaale plan se rahegaa
 In this plan of BSNL, customers will be given 1GB of data per day, whose validity will be 90 days
 itnaa hi nahin graahak is plan se kisi bhi network par analimited kol bhi kar sakate hai
 As far as Jio is concerned, in its Rs 399 plan, customers are given 1GB data and unlimited calls in 84 days validity
 saath hi aapako ye bhi bataa den ki BSNL gharelu phone nirmaataa lava or micromax ke saath saajhedaari main ek ficharphone laane kii taiyaari main he, jisaki keemat kareeb2000 rupehogi

 Ajay Rai will contest bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh's Banaras Lok Sabha seat
 lambey intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar mangalvaar ko congress ne apana ummidavaar ghoshit kar hi diya
 Congress has nominated local MLA Ajay Rai as its candidate
 iske saath banaras ke hiprophile seat par trikoniya muqabla dekhne ko milegaa
 Let us tell you that Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal has already announced to contest from here after public opinion
 banaras se narendra modi ke chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa ke baad se hi aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki congress yahaan par majboot ummidavaar utaar sakati he
 The market of speculation about the names of Digvijay Singh and Anand Sharma was hot
 aakhirkaar congress ne ajay raay ko tikat dekar in kayaason par viraam laga diya
 The Congress defended its decision saying that Ajay Rai is a grassroots leader and he is aware of the local problems of Varanasi

 E-commerce company Snapdeal will invest $ 100 million (about Rs 665 crore) in Shopo
 company kaa makasad haal main shuru is manch se 10 lakh vikreta ko jodna he
 Started in July, Shopo is a mobile only platform that aims to bring small and medium companies (smbs) on a platform that cannot register on the big e-commerce portal
 snapdil ke sah-sansthaapak or mukhya karypalak adhikari (siio) kunal bahal ne kaha, hamane july ke madhya main shopo kii shuruyaat kii or ham pehle 20,000 dukaanon se is manch se jod chuke hai
 The response we have received is fantastic
 unhone kaha kihamaari team ko agle ek saal menshopo par 10 lakh dukaanon ke judane kaa puraa bharosa he
 Bahl said that the company will invest $ 100 million in the next two years to expand the Shopo brand
 14 sadasyeey team dwaara viksit yah manch udhyamiyon ko apane utpaada soochibaddh karaane kii anumati detaa he
 For this they do not need to provide any documents and can avoid long verification process
 saath hi unhen bikri ke liyesnapadil ko koi kamishan nahin dena he
 input language dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke khilaaf daayar yachika ko chunaav ayog ne thukraa diya he
 The petition was filed citing Sisodia's post as a benefit
 jisamen sisodiya ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii gai thi
 This petition was filed by a bjp-affiliated lawyer three months ago
 ayog ne is yachika main koi tathy na pate hue ise khaarij kar diya
 The Commission in its order clearly stated that there is no merit in this petition
 chunaav ayog ke is aadesh ke baad ye saaf ho gaya ki dilli main up mukhyamantri kaa pad laabh kaa nahin he
 After which there has been a cloud of apprehension over the membership of Manish Sisodia
 duusari taraf aam aadmi party ke 21 vidhayakon par bhi offis of profit kaa maamla rahaa he
 After receiving the complaint by the President, the matter was referred to the Chief Election Commission
 jahaan is masale par kai baar sunwaayee ho chuki he
 The Commission has also known the favor of all the mlas in this matter
 sabhi vidhayakon ne likhit rup main ayog ko apana spashtikaran diya he
 The Commission has reserved its decision on this
 ayog raashtrapati tak apane vichaar bhejega, kyonki raashtrapati ne unase is maamle main salaah maangi thi
 Explain that it was alleged that the Delhi government of the common man party had given benefits to its mlas by going against the rules
 agar ayog ye maanata he ki vidhayakon ke jo jimmedaariyaan milin thim wo laabh ke pad ke daayre main aati hai to unki sadsyta par sankat aa saktaa he
 This proverb would probably have been made for the world of taxation that general amnesty is the generosity of the government towards criminals who are too expensive to punish
 tex choron or kaale dhan waalon ko aam maafee (emnesti?) kaa faisla sarkarein hichak ke saath karti hai, kyonki kar choron ko bagaiyr sajaa ke batch nikalne kii suvidha dena hameshaa se aniatik hota he
 Therefore, if there is not enough black money through this facility, then the credibility of the government is damaged
 endie sarkaar ke saath yahi hua he, videsh main jamaa kaala dhan ko lekar ek basir-pair ke chunavi vaade ko puraa karne kii koshish main bhartiya tex system kii vishwasaneeyata par gahari kharonchen lag gai hai
 Due to half-hearted preparations and hasty decisions, an attempt to take out the black money stashed abroad by forgiveness of punishment has fallen flat
 tex choron ne bhi sarkaar kii udaartaa par bharosa nahin kiya he
 During the general elections, the government passed a law (undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets Bill, 2015) from the Parliament in the budget session, after being surrounded by questions on the promise of bringing black money from abroad and depositing it in people's account
 Those possessing black money abroad were given the facility that between July 1 and October 1, if declared hidden wealth abroad, tax (30 percent) and penalty (100 percent tax) were paid
 Which is not action
 teen maheene main is avadhi ke khatm hone par keval 4,147 karod ru
 Has been declared black money of Rs
 2,000 crores to the government
 kaa tex milegaa
 In March this year, in the same column, we wrote that companies were under action even after the promise of secrecy in the 1997 Black Money self-proclamation (VDIS) scheme, so big announcements are suspected under the law, but it was not speculated that Despite unprecedented political figures of black money abroad, there will be so few announcements
 emnesti skim kii vifaltaa kii tah main janaa jaruri he
 The failure of this big initiative on black money proves the government to be novice and rash
 andhere main tiraru darasal, vitt mantralay ke paas videsh main jamaa kaale dhan kii koi thos jaankaree hi nahin thi
 Few countries have made such efforts because their risk of failure is high
 bharat kii pichhali safal scimen bhi deshi kaale dhan par kendrit thim
 Recently, Italy and the US have successfully completed amnesty schemes on black money stashed abroad, for which a strong ground was prepared by gathering information from abroad, while the Finance Ministry is in complete darkness in this matter
 sarkaar ne duniya ke tamaam deshon va tex haiven ko pichley maheenon main kareeb 3,200 anurodh bhejkar soochna hasil karne kii koshish shuru kii he, jinke jawaab abhi aane hai
 The information available with the government was not solid, so the arrow is backfired
 vah party jo videsh main baari kaala dhan jamaa hone kaa daawa kar rahi thi, uske vitt mantri ko is skim kii bhavy vifaltaa ke baad kahana padaa ki videsh main bharat kaa kaala dhan he nahin
 Strategic lapses: The same people who are afraid of punishment try to take advantage of amnesty schemes
 lekin vitt mantralay ne videsh main jamaa dhan ko lekar vibhinn maamalon main sakriy karravaaiyaan, yahaan tak survey bhi is skim se baahar kar die the
 Therefore, those who could come to the scheme for fear of action also did not get a chance
 yah ek badi ranneetik chook he
 Question of trust: The Income Tax Department knew that people would not easily trust this facility in the light of old experiences
 skim ko safal banane ke liye kar prashasan par bharosa badhaane kii koshish honi chahie thi, lekin ek taraf sarkaar kaala dhan ghoshit karne ke liye emnesti de rahi thi to duusari taraf niveshkon va companiyon ko mat (minimum alternetive tex) or puraane maamalon ke liye notice bheje ja rahe the
 This inconsistency weakened the trust in tax administration and ensured the failure of the scheme
 adhuri taiyaarihvitt mantralay ne emnesti ke liye taiyaari nahin kii thi
 Explanations about the scheme came late and most importantly, in the campaign, the brave government did not publicize its ambitious scheme, especially not abroad, where the settled Indians were its biggest customers
 antarrashtriya tajurbe bataate hai ki is tarah kii skiimon ko lekar pratyaksh va paroksh abhiyaan chalate hai taaki adhik se adhik log iskaa hissaa ban saken or safalataa sunishchit ho sake
 The failure of amnesty on black money will be compared to the VDIS scheme of 18 years ago
 tab iske tahat 36,697 karod ru
 The announcement of black money was made, which is ten times the announcements made in the current scheme
 yahi nahin, ise videsh se kaala dhan nikaalane main america (5 arab dollar) or italy (1
 4 billion euros) will also be seen in the light of the latest successes
 chunavi vaade par fajihat se lekar niveshkon ko notice or unki vaapasi or emnesti skim kii vifaltaa tak, pichley solah maah main bharat ke kar prashasan kii saakh teji se giri he
 The latest case of taking black money abroad through banks has also washed away the claims of tax administration
 sarkaar kii aam maafee par logon kaa bharosa na hona ek badi vifaltaa he, jiskaa asar kar prashasan kii vishwasaneeyata va manobal par lambey arse tak rahegaa
 India's tax system may take a long time to recover from this accident

 aapke rail tikat kaa states yadi aarasi main aa jaataa he, to bhul jaaie ki aapako conform berth milegi
 Because, the Ministry of Railways has decided to make the RAC ticketed person travel at half a berth
 lekin iske liye aapse paisa puraa vasula jayega
 The railway has also issued a circular for this
 apane circular memrelvene aarasi berth kii sankhya main badhotaree kar di he, jise tatkaal prabhaav se lagu bhi kar diya gaya he
 This decision of the railway will increase the revenue of the railway, but the problem of passengers is bound to increase
 kyonki aarasi berth par din main to kisi tarah safar kiya ja saktaa he, lekin raat ke vaqt aadhi seat par sikud kar sona aasaan nahin he
 Railways will increase revenue According to the top officials of the railway, by fully RAC of the side berth, the railways will get a profit of about 1500 crore rupees in a year
 isse jahaan ek taraf zyada yatri safar kar paaenge, vahiin duusari taraf ghate kii maar jhel rahi railway kaa ghaataa kuch had tak kam ho paaegaa, lekinyatri suvidhake lihaaj se is faisle ko bahut acha nahin kaha ja saktaa he, kyonki aap paisa puri berth kaa denge, lekin safar baithkar karenge
 These coaches will have RAC berths
 This increase has been made in sleeper, three-tier and two-tier AC category coaches
 circular ke mutabik, ab sleeper class ke har coach main ab said loar kii 7 siten aarasi ke liye arakshit kii gai hai, yani inpar kul 14 yatri safar karenge
 Earlier it had 5 seats for RAC, on which 10 passengers used to travel
 vahiin, thri-tear asi class ke har coach main aarasi berth kii sankhya 4 kar di gai he, jinpar 8 yatri safar kar sakenge
 Earlier it had 2 seats for RAC, on which 4 passengers used to travel
 isi tarah tu-tear asi class ke har coach main ab 3 berth aarasi ke liye arakshit kiye gaye hai, jinpar 6 yatri safar kar sakenge
 Earlier it had 2 berths, on which 4 passengers used to sit and travel
 yatri suvidha ke liye sahi nahin he faislawaise to ek taraf rail mantralay yatri suvidhaayen badhaane kaa daawa karata he, vahiin duusari taraf lagaataar is tarah ke faisle le rahaa he jisase railway kaa safar sukhad hone kii bajaay mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Despite paying full money for doing RAC Kotadoguna, people will get to sit only
 khaas baat ye he ki ye vyavastha lagu hone ke baad hoga ye ki agar aapkaa tikat conform nahin hua he, to seat conform hone kii ummid or kam ho jaaegi
 Also, you will pay money for the whole seat, but you will get half the seat on which you will complete the journey, not by lying down
 jaahir he, rail yatriyon ke liye mantralay kaa ye faisla bahut acha to katai nahin he

 Demonetization is an upbeat exercise for the economy
 is prakriya ke shuru hote hi asar padana shuru ho jaataa he
 From the common man to the government of the country and the biggest company does not escape its impact
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne november ke duusare hafte main dimonetigeshan kii prakriya kaa elaan kiya or desh kii arthvyavastha main sanchalit ho rahi 14 lakh karod kii karency (500 or 1000 kii note main) ko gaiyrkanoonee qaraar de diya
 The timing of this announcement poses a big problem for listed companies in the country's stock market
 dimonetigeshan or listed companiyanelaan ke turant baad aam aadmi ke saath-saath desh ke sabhi kaarobaar main gaiyrkanoonee noton ko badalawaane kii muhim shuru ho chuki he
 This has a direct impact on the stock market as well
 zyaadaatar companiyon ke share bhav main lagaataar giravat darj ho rahi he
 Apart from this decline, this process is going to give very serious results for the companies listed in the stock market
 darasal, november kaa maheenaa listed companiyon kii teesri timahi (oktober, november or disambar) ke madhya main he
 At the end of December, all companies will have to share their quarterly results with the stock market within 45 days
 ab companiyon kii sabase badi chintaa yahi he ki teesri timahi ke madhya main shuru hua karency sankat unke kaarobaar ko agle kuch maheenon tak pareshaan karegaa or ek baat sabhi ko saaf he ki janvari kii shuruyaat main aane vaale unke timahi nattejey aundhe munh gire honge
 Why companies give quarterly results: For companies listed in the stock market, there is a provision to share the complete details of the company's income, expenditure and profits four times in a financial year
 desh main vitt varsh april se shuru hota he or nae saal kii march main khatm hota he
 Hence, the first quarter for companies is april-may-june, second quarter july-august-september, third quarter october-november-december and fourth quarter january-february-march
 in timahi nateezon ke jariye companiyaan share bazaar ko apane finanntial swasth kii puri jaankaree detii he
 Based on this information, the investor in the market decides to buy or sell a company's stock
 kisi bhi timahi kaa behatar nateeja companiyon kaa share bhav badha detaa he
 The purchase of his shares increases
 vahiin kharaab timahi nateezon se companiyon ko share market main nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he kyonki niveshak company se munh modana shuru kar dete hai
 Why is the third quarter the most important? Like the central government budget, all companies prepare their annual plans at the beginning of every financial year
 is vaarshik plan ko lagu karne kii taiyaari aamtaur par pehali timahi main kiya jaataa he
 For example, expanding the company, arranging loans for expansion, etc
 duusari timahi ke dauraan company kaa puraa jor apane vaarshik plan ko prabhavi karne main rahata he
 Usually, the company increases its expenses in this quarter
 teesri timahi kisi bhi company ke vaarshik plan ke hisaab se behad mahatvapurn rahata he
 All the expansion work has been completed in the second quarter
 is timahi main companiyon kaa puraa jor apni aay ko badhaane par rahata he
 From the beginning of the festive season to the new year, once the fourth quarter starts, once again the priority of the companies is to complete the annual accounts and bridge the debt etc
 karency sankat jari, peak sijan main giregi companiyon kii selatisri timahi aate-aate desh main kray kshamta bad jaati he
 The most important kharif crop of the year is ready by the end of October and starts reaching the market
 oktober, november or disambar ke dauraan desh main kisaanon kii jeb main paisa pahunch jaataa he
 Due to this, companies keep an eye on the rural market of the country
 vahiin urban market kii kray kshamta in maheenon main deepawali, durga puja or new year ke festive sijan main bad jaati he
 But due to the demonetization effect, the currency crisis has started in the country in the beginning of November itself
 is sankat main jahaan ghar par rakhaa cash badale jane kaa intjaar kar rahaa he vahiin deshbhar main kharidari keval jarurat maatr kii ho rahi he
 Now the danger to companies is that if the currency crisis in the market does not end soon, there will be a slowdown in buyers in the urban and rural markets and the most important quarter of the year will be completely destroyed for them

 What do the first figures say? The Maharashtra Legislative Assembly has a total of 288 seats and the majority figure is 145
 bijepi ke paas 105, shivasena ke paas 56, ensipi ke paas 54 or congress ke paas 44 siten hai
 The remaining 13 seats are won by smaller parties and 12 independents
 teesraa vikalp he ki shivasena ensipi ke sarmathan se sarkaar banaae or congress vishwasamat se gaiyrhaazir rahe
 In such a situation, Shiv Sena and NCP will have 110 seats and will need support of independents and small parties
 chauthaa vikalp he ensipi ke sharad pavaar mukhyamantri bane or congress or shivasena pavaar ko sarmathan de
 This possibility cannot be ruled out especially when the Shiv Sena has written songs in the pride of Sharad Pawar
 paanchvaan vikalp he ki shivasena ko ensipi or congress apana sarmathan de de
 The three together constitute 154 seats, which is nine more than the majority
 magar isamen congress ko dikkat aa sakati he
 The sixth option is BJP and NCP to form a government together
 donon ko milakar 159 siten hoti hai jo bahumat se 14 siten adhik he
 Approaching the NCP and BJP may not be a big deal
 kai baar donon ke bich rannitik saajhedaari ho chuki he or santvaan vikalp he ki sarkaar bijepi banaae jo ki sabase badi party ke rup main uskaa haq he or ensipi matdaan ke dauraan gaiyrhaazir rahe
 Then a majority of 118 mlas will be needed which can be met with the help of independents and small parties
 maharashtra main sarkaar par suspence jabatak bana rahegaa is tarah ke vikalpon par charchaa hona laazmi he
 It would be best that the Shiv Sena and the BJP forget their differences and form a government even if both have to pull one step back

 Narendra Patel said- Voice is not mine, in this case Narendra Patel told 'aaj Tak' that the voice in the audio is not his
 narendra ne kaha ki jis raily kii wo baat kar rahe hai, wo kaaphi puraani raily he

 ham baat kar rahe hai team india ke ladaake cricketer anil kumble kii
 This incident is one of the most inspiring moments in the cricket world
 aaj anil kumble kii janmdin he
 Happy Birthday to them! Wait for my book on 'monkeygate': Kumble, born on 17 October 1970, did not have a turn like Shane Warne in the balls of the leg-spinner, but there was no match in the art of dodging the batsmen
 chaahe match kii sthiti kuch bhi ho kumble har pal team ke liye 100 fisadi se zyada dete
 The result of his hard work is that he took 619 wickets in 132 Tests
 test cricket main sabase zyada wicket lene vaale gendbaajon kii suchi main vah tisare paaydaan par hai
 This leg-spinner also had the feat of taking 10 wickets in an innings of a Test match
 yah record unhone 1999 main dilli ke firozshah kotla maidan main banaaya
 The entire Pakistani team was made a victim by spending only 74 runs
 sanyog dekhie ki kumble ne 2008 main apane test kariyar kaa aakhri match bhi isi maidan par khelaa
 Kumble's fighting spirit can also be gauged from the fact that while batting at number seven or eighth, he would also contribute significantly with the bat
 test main 1 shatak ke saath 5 ardhashatak iske saboot hai
 He took 5 or more wickets in a single innings on more than 35 occasions in Test matches
 or ek match main 10 se zyada wicket lene kaa karnama 8 baar kiya
 Talking of Kumble's misfortune in odis, Kumble has 30 in 271 matches
 89 kii ausat se 337 wicket jatke
 His best performance was 6 wickets for just 12 runs
 ran kharchane ke maamle main kumble kii kanjusee kaa anumaan is aankade se lagaaie, vanade main unka ikonimi rate 4

 '' sibiai ne buudhvaar ko ahmedabad kii special court menishrat jahaan encounterces main pehali chargeshit daayar kar di
 Ishrat's encounter in the charge sheet is said to be fake
 isi ke saath isamen gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or amit shah kaa naam nahin he, lekin sabsidiari intelegence beuro (esaibi) tathaa gujarat police ke afasaron par jaanch agency kii gaaj giri he
 CBI has accused 7 people including former DIG DG Vanzara
 aakhirkaar 9 saal baad ishrat jahaan encounter kaa sach baahar aa hi gaya
 The CBI filed a chargesheet in the court claiming that the encounter on June 15, 2004, in which the Gujarat police and IB claimed to have killed four people, including Ishrat Jahan, as a terrorist, was fake
 sibiai chargeshit ke mutabik ishrat jahaan aatankwaadi nahin thi
 The chargesheet has accused DIG DG Vanzara, Narendra Amin, PP Pandey, Tarun Barot, Anaju Choudhary and JG Parmar, who headed the former IPS GL Singhal, Ishrat encounter
 mohan kalasava kaa bhi naam he, jinaki maut ho chuki he
 All of them have been charged with kidnapping, arms act, murder and tampering of evidence
 sibiai ne court se kaha he ki puri sajeesh gujarat police or ibi kii mileebhagat se hui he
 The chargesheet states that it has been revealed in the CBI investigation that Ishrat was not a terrorist and was innocent, but the activities of her three associates Javed, Amjad Ali Rana and Jousheen were suspicious
 isi ke saath sibiai ne is maamle main or jaanch kii jarurat bataai he
 The CBI has stated in the charge sheet that the encounter was a joint operation of the Gujarat Police and the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (SIB) and DG Vanzara plotted the entire encounter
 sibiai ke mutabik ibi ke vishesh nideshak rajinder kumaar or agency ke chaar adhikariyon ke khilaaf jaanch jari he
 Now the question is that if the encounter was fake, then such a big conspiracy was hatched to benefit whom
 chargeshit main narendra modi or unke kareebi amit shah kaa naam nahin he
 But it is being said that the CBI may later file a supplementary charge sheet in this case, in which Modi and Shah can be named
 chargeshit ke mutabik gujarat police or ibi ne jishaan ali ko april main or amjad ali ko may main agavakar alag-alag form house main rakhaa tha
 After this, Ishrat and Javed Sheikh were kidnapped on 11 June 2004 and placed in second place
 sibiai ke mutabik 12 or 13 june ko diji banzaara, peepi pandeya or rajendra kumaar ke bich meeting hui thi
 It is said that the encounter was decided in this meeting
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki 14 june ko vanjaaraa ke nirdesh par jiel singhl sabsidiari ibi daftar gaye or ek bag main hathiyaar ikattha kiye
 However, different opinions emerged about Ishrat in the meeting
 encounter ke din javed, ishrat or jishaan ko javed kii car se maukey par laayaa gaya
 a policeman was driving the car
 sibiai ke mutabik gujarat police ne encounter ko manage kiya
 According to the CBI, the police had also drafted an FIR before the encounter
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki puri chargeshit jaanch or saboot par aadhaarit he or aropiyon ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane ke liye uske paas pukhta saboot hai
 He also has 20 to 25 witnesses
 philhal yah shuruaati chargeshit he
 The CBI has asked the court to give more time to gather evidence
 do-teen baad final chargeshit daakhil kii jaaegi
 Significantly, on 15 June 2004, Ishrat and her three friends were shot dead by the police in Naroda area of ahmedabad
 gujarat police kaa daawa tha ki ye chaaron mukhyamantri narendra modi kii hatya ke iraade se aae the or wo muthbhed main maare gaye the
 But now the CBI has called this encounter fake
 ishrat jahaan cese: kab kya hua9 saal pehle hua ek encounter gujarat ke mukhiya narendra modi ke liye nasoor ban gaya he
 In this case, the Modi government has been constantly pointing fingers
 yahi nahin, modi sarkaar ke kareebi bataae jane vaale ek police adhikari bhi is cese main jail main hai
 Know what has happened in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case so far
 15 june 2004 kii subah-subah khabar ai ki modi ko maarane kii sajeesh rachane vaale maare gaye, ahmedabad or gandhinagar ke bich sunsaan sadak par gujarat police kii krime branch kii team ne 4 logon ko encounter main maar giraaya
 Among the dead was 19-year-old Ishrat Jahan from Mumbai, who was related to lashkar-e-taiba
 ishrat ke alaava marane waalon main the pranesh pillai urf javed gulam shaikh, amjad ali rana or jishaan johar
 He was shot dead by the police led by DIG DG Vanzara

 The report by Tamang called Ishrat Jahan encounter as fake
 tamang ne apni report main likhaa ki banjaaraa kii team ne ishrat jahaan or uske teenon saathiyon kaa cold blded murder kiya he
 On 9 September 2009, the Gujarat High Court set up an SIT to investigate, putting a stay on Tamang's report
 hoicourt ne ye kaha ki jaanch uski nigaraanee main hi hogi
 In September of 2010, SIT head R

 Teachers' Day celebrations are not being celebrated extensively in many schools in Delhi
 kai shikshakon kaa maananaa he ki shikshak ab surakshit or sammaan mahasoos nahin karte hai
 Many teacher associations say that they are not celebrating this festival against the arrest and misbehavior of teachers
 bataa den ki is virodh main dilli uniwarsity, jamiya milaayaa islamia or jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity ke shikshakon ne bhi pradarshan kaa elaan kiya he
 On the occasion of Teacher's Day, teachers will protest peacefully and wear black batches for their demands
 vahiin sabhi shikshak apane adhikaar surakshit rakhane ke liye kuch kanoonee suraksha upayon or uchit kanoon kii maang kar rahe hai
 Here, Teachers Day is celebrated not on September 5, but on October 5, this is the reason that there will be a protest on 5 September (teacher's Day) from the 'delhi State Public Schools Management Association'
 unhone pehle elaan kiya tha ki ve alcon public cese sahit vibhinn maamalon main POCSO act ke durupyog ke khilaaf subah 11 baje jantar mantar main ek shanti march karenge
 On the other hand, many teachers have said that they are scared about the decision not to celebrate Teachers' Day
 unhen dar he ki unhen 'jhuthe aaropon' par jail bheja ja saktaa he
 So thus, they have decided not to celebrate September 5 this year on a large scale, Teachers' Day
 kyonki ab unhen lagata he, 'khushi rahi hi nahin'
 He said that parents should have some faith when handing over their children to school
 agar aisa nahin hota he to bhavishya main "guru brahma, guru vishnu" kaa matlab kuch bhi nahin hoga
 These are great teachers, who are not only for India but for the world
 To reduce celebrations on Teachers Day, the National Progressive School advised that children will be teachers but teachers will not take any gifts and will not necessarily have dinner or not
 vahiin ection cameti skulon ko bhi aisa karnaa hoga
 It was being told that Teachers' Day is not being celebrated with much fanfare in Springdales School, Bluebell, Indian School, Meera Model, Holy Child Schools

 rajya main congress ko rankapa se bees adhik siten hasil hui hai
 Since 1999, NCP has had Krishnarao Rakhmajirao Desai alias Babasaheb Kupekar of Speaker Padarakampa as the outgoing Speaker of the House

 This coalition came to power in 1999

 Sources said that NCP may present Finance Minister Dilip Valse Patil for the post of Chairman
 congress grih, urja, gramin vikaas or lok nirmaan mantralayon par daawa kar rahi he jo abhi rakanpa ke paas he

 congress 2004 kii tarah is baar sahyogi dal ko pramukh vibhaag dene ke mood main nahin he
 Sources said, "NCP should understand the changed equation
 vah ab adhik seat hone kaa daawa nahin kar sakate hai
 Sources said that the NCP is trying to placate its rebel leaders who won in the assembly so that it can be a better bargain with the Congress if needed

 Because our mentality is still slaves

 We do not have to mourn, but Hindi is like a Hindu, it will continue to absorb whoever comes

 Anant said that the people of Hindi had problems with the market, that is why the market got away from them

 a case has been registered against Rajendra Kaswa under section 304 of IPC

 For this, in front of the Ghanta Ghar in Husainabad of old Lucknow, there is the land of the Shia Waqf Board, on which the mosque should be built and its name should be named "masjid-e-aman", not after the name of a Muslim king or ruler
 bataa den ki shiya board ne ayodhya ke vivaadit maamle kaa formula pichley saal 18 navambar ko supreme court main jamaa kara diya
 Among those who signed this draft of Shia Central Waqf Board, Suresh Das of Digambar Akhara, Dharmadas of Hanuman Garhi, Bhaskar Das of Nirmohi Akhara were also supported by Ram Vilas Vedanti, Gopaldas and Narendra Giri
 ayodhya vivaad ke hal kaa masauda (masjid-e aman) supreme court main daakhil kiya tha, jise court ne sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 However, Rizvi had said that Hindus and Shias agree on this, the Sunni Waqf Board has nothing to do with it, it is also in the court, we are also in the court, the court will decide
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya kii bajaae hamane lakhanu main isliye prastaavit kii he kyonki puraani lakhanu me ghantaghar ke saamne badi jameen maujuud he, yahaan shiya aabaadi bhi kaaphi he or vivaadon se dur he isliye hamaara formula yahi he

 As ISIS militants find themselves surrounded by Iraqi forces during the ongoing war in Mosul, suddenly the emotional drama begins
 gidgidaate hai, sadakon par lotane lagate hai
 Weeping wildly
 vakt kaa pahiyaa hameshaa ghumta he
 The period of persecution does not last long
 ek vakt tha jab wo dusron par julm dhahaate the
 And now is the time that weeping ourselves
 ro rahe hai apni barbaadi par, apni haar par or saamne khadi apni maut par
 The fear of death on the face of terrorists - they are crying faintly when the terrorists who have killed themselves on the head, hang them on the cross, shoot and burn them alive
 iraqi fuj kii giraft main aane ke baad khudaiessake aatankwaadiyon ke chehron par havaaiyaan ud rahi hai
 Fear is creeping out of their eyes
 ro rahe hai bagdadi ke shaitanaiess ke garh kii ye koi iklauti tasviren nahin hai
 The situation is that Baghdadi terrorists are now fleeing from the streets of Mosul
 jinhen apane aakaa bagdadi par khud se zyaada bharosa tha, ab wo uske jane ke baad zaar zaar ro rahe hai
 Neither the Khilafat of Baghdadi is able to stop these tears coming out from the eyes of the terrorists
 naa hi 72 huuron kaa sapana or na hi islamic state kaa khwab
 Leaving Baghdadi, these terrorists would never have imagined that their Khalifa Baghdadi would leave them in the midst of something and disappear like this
 lekin maut kaa dar shaayad hota hi aisa he
 When it came to life, the Khalifa ran away, but left behind the fear of his horror
 aatankiyon ko na bakhshane kaa farmanjo aatanki zindaa hai, wo iraqi senaaon ke khauf main ro rahe hai
 Those who are in the possession of the soldiers are crying for life
 kul milakar bagdadi kii sultanate main ronaa-pitnaa machaa hua he
 But the Iraqi army has been instructed not to have any mercy with these terrorists
 maut saamne dekhakar bura halakareeb maheene bhar pehle ek audio massej ke zarie bagdadi ne apane aatankwaadiyon ko maidan-e-jang main date rahane ke liye uksaaya tha
 But since then neither Baghdadi has any idea nor his special spoon
 aise main aatankwaadiyon ko lagane laga he ki bagdadi khud to chalaa gaya, magar unhen maut ke saamne daal gaya
 Before the Emotional Dramabgadadija, the decree was heard on the ground for Iraqi forces and the terrorists surrounded by American warships in the sky, that unless you kill and kill, then you die as a suicide
 magar marane ke bajaae in aatankiyon ne yahaan imotional tareeqa dhundh nikaala he
 By crying out for the Islam, these terrorists are calling on the wandering young people who think like themselves by calling for Islam
 taaki inaki khud kii jaan batch sake or maidan-e-jang main unki jaan qurbaan kar ke ye bagdadi ke die target puraa kar saken
 In its occupied areas, ISIS is tricking the youth by calling for Islam
 mazahab ke naam par banaae fidainalgataar aise naujavaanon ke video in ilaakon main viral kiye ja rahe hai, jinhen fidaayin banaakar bagdadi is aag main jhonk chukaa he
 The terrorists are making him a hero by calling them martyrs
 taaki in jaise or fidaayin paidaa kiya ja saken
 But the youth, who are being made fidayeen in the name of religion, have been ordered to kill Baghdadi for not doing so
 sena ne jari kiya aatankiyon kaa videomilicia force ne jo video jari kiya he, usamen aatanki ro-rokar bayaan kar rahe hai ki bagdadi ke logon ne inhen jananath jane or huuron se milane kaa sapana dikhaaya tha
 Was tricked about people of other denomination
 lekin jab iesas kii hakeekat se saamana hua to ye jaan bachaakar bhaagane lage, tab bagdadi ne inaki maut kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 Death on the head of terrorists now when there is death even before them
 peeche bhi maut he
 So they are beating their heads and apologizing for the crimes
 sirf khabar hi nahin balki tasviren or video bhi hai ki kaise bagdadi kii ek team sirf naujavaanon ko bargala rahi he
 In their occupied areas, they are sometimes doing brain wash of people in mosques and sometimes in offices
 do hajaar se zyada aatanki halaakakabhi mazahab ke naam par to kabhi bandook ke jor par
 Sometimes crying and sometimes screaming
 ye aatanki mosul main har pintara aazamaa rahe hai
 So that they can get local support
 magar hakeekat ye he ki koi ab inke jhaanse main aane ko taiyaar nahin he
 For the past two months, the Iraqi Army has killed more than 2 thousand ISIS militants in Mosul

 Isha is being trolled because of her statements
 darasal, ek intervyuu main ishan ne shivakartikeya or south superstar ajit kumaar ke bare main baat kii
 She said on Ajit Kumar that she likes Thala Ajit but does not know if he still works in the film industry
 actress ne kaha, ''main pehle ajit ko behad pasand karti thim, lekin mujhe maaloom nahin ki ve abhi bhi industry main maujuud hai
 'even though Isha Koppikar compared sivakarthi with Rajini and it angered Rajini fans, the bigger insult is to Ajith and his fans, when she said "I don't know whether Ajith is still acting"

 At that time only three to five policemen were present and there was no crowd

 sajid khan kii film 'hamashakals' or soni tivi par saalon se chale aa rahe detective sho siaidi kaa majaak udaata kutiyapa video in dinon fasebuk par share ho rahaa he
 No one will be able to live without laughing by watching this video, especially those who have seen the film Humshakals and CID
 is video main ishaare se dikhaaya gaya he ki sajid ne is film ko banaakar kaise logon ke dimag ko khaaya he
 Ever since the release of the film, people started making fun of it on social networking sites
 haalanki is video main sidhe taur par film yaa dharawahik kaa naam nahin liya gaya he
 You can also watch this video: jharkhand vidhansabha ke sheetakaaleen satr ke chauthe din jabardast hangaame or afra-tafari ke bich CNT-SPT sanshodhan vidheyak paas ho gaya
 During this time, there was a huge uproar in and outside the House against the CNT-SPT Amendment Bill
 vipaksh ne sadan ke andar sanshodhan bill ke parche phaade, vahiin kuch vipakshi vidhayak spikar ke saamne rakhi teble par chadh gaye
 There was an attempt to throw chairs inside the house
 congress vidhayak irfan ansaari ne sadan ke andar virodh karte vakt fom spray kiya
 Actually, the reason for the uproar was the bill amending the hundred year old CNT -SPT Act applicable in Jharkhand
 jahaan sarkaar ise kisi bhi keemat par paas karwaane par adi thi
 At the same time, the opposition was continuously opposing it
 purv ghoshit kaarykram ke mutabik sarkaar aaj is sanshodhan bill ko sadan main pesh kiya
 At the same time, the opposition created a ruckus when it was presented
 spikar dinesh uraanv par bhi kursi se hamalaa kiya gaya, spikar ke saamne rakhi sanshodhan kii copy tak faad di gai
 Opposition legislators said that they were ready to hand over the ruling party, but the amendment bill would not be introduced
 kya he CNT-SPT sanshodhan vidheyakadarasal CNT - SPT act adivaasiyon kii bhoomi ke liye banaaya hua ek kanoon he
 On May 3, a proposal to amend the Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and Santhal Parganas Tenancy was passed in the Jharkhand Cabinet meeting
 in donon praavdhaanon main sanshodhan ke tahat jameen maalik ko apni bhoomi main parivartan kaa adhikaar milegaa
 Apart from agriculture, they will also be able to use their land for commercial purposes
 isse unako kaarobaari rate bhi milegaa, ab tak adivasee apni bhoomi kisi or ko nahin bech sakate the
 They can buy and sell land from a tribal only in a police station area
 sanshodhan ke tahat sirf thane kii bandish khatm ho jaaegi
 However, the landowner's ownership will remain on his land
 pehle yah praavdhaan tha ki anusuchit janajati ke bhoomi kaa upyog khan or udyog ke liye kiya jaataa tha or iske liye kamishnar kii manjuuri jaruri thi
 But after the passage of this bill, now this land can also be used for other schemes like infrastructure, roads, transmission lines for energy, transport, communication
 agar kisi kaam ke liye anusuchit janajati kii jameen lee jaati he to uskaa upyog paanch saal ke andar anivaary rup se karnaa hoga, agar aisa nahin hua to vah jameen jis parivaar se lee gai he, use waapas kar di jaaegi
 Also, the compensation given in lieu of land will not be refunded
 After the bill was passed, Chief Minister Raghuvar Das said that we wanted to discuss the bill within the House but the opposition was not ready for discussion
 aise main bill paas hote hi bijepi jashn manaate najar ai
 Uproar from the road to the house and outside the house, there was a fierce commotion today
 shahar main kai jagahon par vipaksh ke kaaryakartaaon par lathicharge hua or aansu gas bhi chodi gai
 However, due to the implementation of the CNT-SPT Act in Jharkhand, many major projects of the Center and the state have been hanging because the Act comes in the way of land acquisition
 vahiin is kanoon ke tahat adivasee bhi jameen rahete bhi kisi duusari jati ke logon ko ise bech nahin sakate, duusari taraf bank bhi aisi jameenon par lone dene se kataraate he
 In such a situation, passing this bill will have far-reaching consequences
 jabaki vipakshi dalon kaa kahana he ki is sanshodhan ke baad adivasee kahi ke nahin rahenge, ab unki jal-jangal-jameen bhi puunjipatiyon main baant di jaaegi
 Significantly, in Jharkhand, the tribal population is around 26 per cent of the population of about 1
25 billion, most of these votes have traditionally been held by Shibu Soren's party JMM

 darasal nitish kii siyasat kaa ye ajeeb sanyog he ki wo jis bhi party ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hote hai, us party ke marji ke raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ummidavaar ke khilaaf apni rajamandi kii muhar lagaai
 This time not only in this election, but even before that their history has been similar
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne raashtrapati or uparashtrapati chunaavon main kramash: sattarudh or vipakshi dal kaa samarthan kar phir se vahi doharaaya he, jo unhone 2012 ke chunaavon main kiya tha
 At that time he was officially part of the opposition
 raashtrapati chunaav main nitish mahagathbandhan ke saath the lekin vot unki party jediu ke logon ne endie ummidavaarramnath kovindke paksh main matdaan kiya
 While his ally in the Grand Alliance, from his party leader Lalu Prasad Yadav to Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, tried to convince Nitish Kumar
 lalu ne to yahaan tak kaha ki ramnath kovind sangh jude hue, nitish kumaar unhen vot na karen or bihar kii beti mira kumaar ko samarthan karen
 Ghulam Nabi Azad also said that Nitish Kumar has taken the first decision on the defeat of Bihar's daughter
 unhone kaha ki jo log ek siddhant main vishwaas karte hai, wo ek faisla lete hai
 And people who believe in many principles make different decisions
 to nitish kumaar ne congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki wo congress ke pichhalggu nahin hai
 In support of Ramnath Kovind said that Ram Kovind did a very good job while holding the post of Governor of Bihar
 maujuuda daur main ab jab nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se naata todakar endie kheme main aa gaye he
 In such a situation, the NDA hoped that Nitish would support his candidate Venkaiah Naidu in the election of the Vice President, but Nitish Kumar did not do so
 unhone upie ummidavaar gopal krishna gandhi ke paksh main samarthan karne kaa elaan karke endie ko bhi apane swabhaav se parichay kara diya
 Now Nitish is with the NDA, but his party is voting for UPA candidate Gopalakrishna Gandhi in the Vice Presidential election
 gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar ne kuch aisa hi itihaas 2012 main bhi doharaaya tha
 Nitish's party was part of the bjp-led NDA at that time
 jisane raashtrapati pad ke liye ummidavaar pranab mukherjee kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Also supported Jaswant Singh of NDA for the post of Vice President
 usee ke baad bijepi se nitish kumaar kii dooriyaan badhane lagi thi
 After that Nitish had different opinions from NDA on many issues
 2014 ke aam chunaavon ke liye narendra modi ko netaa chune jane ke baad unhone 2013 main gathbandhan tod liya tha

 China says that there has been no change in its position on the 50 billion dollar SEPEC project and the issue should be resolved bilaterally

 jis din academy ke liye gaya mere parents alag ho gaye
 It was difficult for me emotionally
 academy main pehla saal behad mushkil tha
 There were a total of eight people in that batch of academies and i was the youngest in age
 main raat main so nahin paata
 Tennis was not very popular then
 strecchar nahin tha
 But five years later the junior reached the top in the circuit
 germany kii wo sard shamjab main 18 saal kaa tha tab kii baat he
 In October 1991 was in Wuzburg, Germany
 agle din se toornament tha
 i wanted to stay in court and practice at night
 store keeper ne ijaajat to de di lekin saare daravaaje lock kar die
 Just left a window open that if there is some emergency, i can jump from there and run away
 magar aisa hua nahin
 On that very cold night i remained alone
 vahi jo jajba tha main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 The thought was that we want this and we will achieve it
 us raat ke baad main lagaataar jeeta or toornament main jeet hasil kii
 After that the process started going on
 magar in sabake baad aaj bhi jo iklauti cheez jiskaa mujhe sabase zyada garv he
 What i want to convey to you is that if a young boy from Kolkata can do all this, you can too
 sab kuch jhonkkar kheliye jindagi kaa khedgar aap vaaki gaharaai se kuch chaahate hai
 And this desire is very strong, so you have to choose the right people, right environment and right questions
 sahi manch kaa chunaav karnaa hoga
 Everything i am today is because of my family, my peers and the coach
 sahi team ke saath, sahi logon kii sohabat main hona behad jaruri he
 Those are the ones who push you towards excellence, working as catalysts
 apane logon ke liye, apane jhande ke liye khelnaa se bada koi josh koi jajba nahin ho saktaa
 But there are not always good days, sometimes you are very low in this journey of excellence
 tab aapako apni trick banani hongi, kuch aisi tarkiben jo us dhundhalake main bhi chehre par muskaan kii chamak or nae sire se sajaayaa yakeen laa saken
 If you can handle both victory and defeat, then come and play the game of life, with all the passion, everything from Jhonkarpase to the question
 excitement
 pichley 24 saal main tennis centre bade paimaane par khule hai
 Awareness about food and fitness has increased manifold
 main desh ke sabhi yuvaaon ko is nai lahar ke liye badhai detaa hum
 This desire to become the next Leander, the next Sachin, will take us forward
 sports kii haalat pehle se bilashak behatar hui he
 What is it that lets it run continuously? ritair nahin hone detaa
 Doesn't stop? Passion for life
 bhukh abhi nahin miti he tennis ke liye
 5 feet 10 inches
 tennis ke liye lihaaj se ye bahut majboot pair nahin hai
 Now our team is working on how to change this
 to har vakt kuch nayaa hota rahata haimain yahaan aa rahaa tha drive ke dauraan, ek badi film kaa ofer aayaa he
 There is a famous banner
 masalaa acting kaa nahin he
 The issue is the use of time

 i am also eagerly awaiting them all
 mahesh bhupati kaa saath kyon chuta

 kya galat ho gaya? landan olympic ke pehle khabar mili ki aapas main itani bhi nahin ban rahi ki desh ke liye khel saken?mahesh or main 9 saal saath rahe
 When he came to college, he was not sure about tennis
 ham 95 main jakarta gaye khilne saath main
 He was defeated in singles
 muscat jane vaala tha
 i said why are you going dubles khelte hai
 He said that there is no money
 papa bula rahe hai
 By then i was also playing in singles
 to baat hui ki chalo tri karte hai
 i do not go to any event just to participate
 to home work karke gaya tha
 We came back and signed Mahesh and started winning again
 skills thim hamaare bheetar
 There was a hunger to win
 pichley saal kaa olympic vakya, mere jivan kaa dukhad din tha
 Politics should not be played in sports
 jab world ranking he
 Selection process
 benchmark he ki koun desh ko riprogent kar saktaa he
 Mahesh knew that if there is a winning pair for the country, it is he, me and Rohan Bopanna
 magar aisa hua nahin
 i missed the second Olympic medal for the country
 desh ne ganvaa diya
 i am also an Entertainer with Athletes
 agar koi paise kharch karke popcorn lekar haul main pahunchataa he, to vahaan bhi mujhe best dena he
 I'm not there to please everyone

 Hmmm a total of eight machines have broken so far

 It has also suggested to the government that it would be better to set up the State Industrial Security Force on the lines of the Central Government's CISF
 matlab rajya kii police main ab unka vishwaas nahin rahaa
 Bihar Industries Association President KPS Kesari had also met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recently on the law and order situation in the state, but after the killing of businessmen one after another in the state, it seems clear that his trust in the government has come down
 buudhvaar ko bihar industries association ke rajat jayanti samaaroh ke kaarykram main khud mukhyamantri nitish kumaar to nahin aae lekin up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi pahunche or unhone mana ki kanoon vyavastha se sambandhit koi bhi ghatana ho jaati he to swaabhaavik he us se maahaul karaab ho jaataa he
 Sushil Modi said that all of us are heartbroken and committed to apprehend the culprits, but whenever the incident happened during the rule of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, it is not that the culprits have not been caught and the culprits have not been punished This incident is also an unfortunate incident and the government has taken it as a challenge

 The case of the controversial statement made by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary Swami Prasad Maurya regarding Hindu deities is now getting caught up

 BJP State Spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that how can a BSP leader make a statement on the Hindu Gods and Goddesses in the BSP? bhaajapa netaa kaha ki puja-paath aadi ke sambandh main basapa netaa swami prasad maury kii kahi baaten unki apni khud kii nijee raay va pratikriya bataane main juty basapa pramukh mayawati un par karrwai kyon nahin karti
 He said that the BSP, which is struggling with the desperation of defeat, is now engaged in mutilating social systems
 rajya main hue upachunaavon main nirdaleey pratyaashiyon ko vot dene kii apil beasar sabit hui he
 The BSP leader's statement has hurt social buildings
 isse purv, mayawati ne ek bayaan jari kar safataur par kaha ki party ko kisi dharm vishesh par ochhi tippanee karne waalon se koi lenadena nahin he
 He also said that the party has nothing to do with Maurya's statement, it is his personal opinion
 basapa pramukh ne kaha, 'party baba bhimrao ambedkar dwaara nirmit bhartiya samvidhan ke dharmanirpekshata ke mul siddhant ke aadhaar par or uski sahi manshaa ke anusaar sabhi dharmo kaa sammaan karti he
 Here, respecting the way of living, marriage, marriage, worship and culture etc
 of the people of all communities who believe in different religions in their country is against interfering in them
 ' Significantly, Maurya had said on Sunday that gauri-ganesh should not be worshiped at weddings
 yah manuaadi vyavastha main daliton or pichhadon ko gumraah kar unako shaasha se gulam banane kii sajeesh he
 The BSP leader also said that in Hinduism, a pig can honor a pig as a god
 gadhe ko bhavani, chuuhe ko ganesh or ullu ko lakshmi kii sawari kahkar puja kii jaati he, lekin shudra ko sammaan nahin diya jaataa
 People are very angry about this disputed statement
