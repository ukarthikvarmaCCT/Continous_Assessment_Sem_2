 The 'need to make the law tougher' This incident in Salem has once again sparked debate on Cybercrime
 sawaal niyaman se aage ab kanoonee karrwai or kanoon or sakht banane kii ho rahi he
 Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi says that the police generally act very carelessly in the case of cybercrime
 har thane kii police ko is ore sartak karne kii jarurat he
 Read, the highlights of the conversation with Maneka Gandhi on cybercrime - the way the graph of cybercrime against women is increasing, fake pictures are being put on social media, do you think the law should be strengthened? Maneka Gandhi - It is very important to strengthen the law
 police ke jo cell hai, unhen ise sakhti se lagu karnaa chahie
 He acts very carelessly on cybercrime
 hamane yah ek baar nahi kai dfa bolaa he
 This crime is not only on women

 Especially from small towns
 ladke tasviir lete hai phir blackmel karte hai
 Every police station should be cautious on this
 sawaal- lekin kis dhang se kanoon ko majboot karne kii jarurat he
 Needs to be taken forward? Maneka Gandhi - i do not know
 hamako is par sochakar home ministry ke saath salaah leni hogi ki kis tareeke se kanoon ko itnaa tagada banaaya jaae ki log dare
 Question- Cyber experts say that there is a shortage in the law, it needs to be revived and strengthened
 majboot karne ke liye aap is mudde ko home ministry se tech ap karne vaali hai?menka gandhi- haa, main bilkul tech ap karuungi
 Question- Maneka ji has two incidents
 pehali to 21 saal vaali ladki kaa phek photo jis din se viral hua or doosraa 24 saal kii ladki kii hatya kar di gai
 You said that women who are police volunteers, the home ministry has accepted your proposal

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan smiled in the face at two and a half on 16 May, the important day of Indian politics, “BJP has won a historic victory under the leadership of Mr
 Narendra Modi
 narendra bhai kaa netritv chamatkaari he
 The dream which was seen by Deendayalji and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, for which Atalji, Advaniji worked, was fulfilled
 ” unhone patrakaron se kaha, “achche din aa gaye hai
 "this was the first time Chauhan openly showered flowers of praise on the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 chouhan ko purv up-pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani kaa sipahsalaar mana jaataa he, jinhone modi ko pradhanmantri banaae jane kaa virodh kiya tha
 But when Modi's wave became a storm in the country, Chauhan did not delay to congratulate him
 chouhan kaaphi khush dikh rahe the
 The Modi wave and his charisma combined to win the BJP unilaterally in the general elections and it won 27 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main bijepi ko rajya main 16 siten hasil hui thim
 The modi-chauhan couple proved to be so powerful that Sushma Swaraj, who was again contesting from Vidisha, defeated her Congress rival and Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh's brother Laxman Singh by a huge margin of 4,10,698 votes
 isi tarah purv kendriya mantri sumitra mahajan ne madhya pradesh kii indore seat se lagaataar aathvin baar jitkar itihaas rach diya, vah bhi 4,66,901 voton ke baari antar se
 The conch shell of bjp's victory is also echoing in Chhattisgarh
 16 may ko subah kareeb paune gyaarah baje chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne narendra modi ko phone karke badhai di
 The two kept talking for a long time and their guess was that the BJP would get a majority and the Congress would be reduced to 70 seats
 yah modi lahar or raman singh kii saaf-suthri chhavi kaa parinaam tha ki chhattisgarh main bijepi ko 10 siten milin
 It was a result of the Modi wave that even the first Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Ajit Jogi could not save his seat of Mahasamand and lost to his nearest rival Chandulal Sahu by 1,556 votes
 madhya pradesh main congress chhindwara or guna ke apane do garh bachaane main kaamyaab hui he, jahaan se kendriya mantri kamalnath or jyotiraditya sindhiya ko jeet mili he
 Congress state party chief and Khandwa MP Arun Yadav lost to his nearest BJP rival Nandkumar Singh Chauhan by a margin of 2,59,714 votes
 2009 main congress ko rajya kii 29 main se 12 siten hasil hui thim
 In that election, the Congress won half the seats in the Malwa region
 lekin is baar bijepi ne apana homework tagada kiya or malwa kii sabhi aath siton par use vijay mili
 The BJP and RSS paid special attention to the Malwa region in preparation for the elections
 bijepi kii rajya sarkaar ne narmada or kshipraa nadiyon ko indore ke ujjaini main jodakar unke jal ko malwa ke shushk ilaakon tak pahunchaaya
 BJP has gained a lot from this step
 16wein aam chunaav kuch had tak 1977 ke aam chunaavon jaise hi hai jisamen avibhajit madhya pradesh (chhattisgarh sahit) kii 40 siton main se 39 par congress haar gai thi or janata party ne ye siten chin lee thim
 The only candidate of the Congress, Gargi Shankar Mishra, then won from Chhindwara
 sthiti saaf thi, lekin madhya pradesh main november ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi buree tarah haar kaa saamana karne vaali congress isse koi sabak nahin le pai
 During the preparations for the elections, the BJP launched a spirited campaign with a united face and Mission 29 (with the aim of winning all 29 seats), while factionalism remained in the Congress
 uske teen vidhayak sanjay pathak, dinesh ahirwar or narayan treepathi pichley maheene hi bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Narendra Modi held 11 public meetings in Madhya Pradesh in which he received tremendous support
 chouhan ne chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan rajya main 155 jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Senior BJP leader Sumitra Mahajan says that Modi wave and Chauhan's charisma uprooted the Congress from Madhya Pradesh

 According to Rajan Shahi, the producer of the serials 'bidai' and 'yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai', which garnered good trps on the small screen, he believes only in doing his job and always draws inspiration from experienced producers like Ekta Kapoor rather than comparing him

 udhar star se anban khatm hone ke baad ekta bhi phir se apane dharawahik ‘tere liye’ ke saath star plus ke platform par vaapasi kar raheen hai
 When Rajan was asked if he would still be competing with Ekta, to whom he has been compared before, he said, "balaji: Ekta Kapoor's production house: and other big producer companies have i have a long experience and my experience is less than this, so i do not compare but take inspiration from such people
 ’’ unhone is sambandh main puche gayi sawaal par ‘bhashaa’ se kaha ki pehle bhi ekta kapur se prerana lete rahe hai or ab bhi lenge or unase kabhi koi spardhaa nahin maani bhale hi log kuch bhi kehete rahen

 maharashtra sarkaar main bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne bhi fadanvis sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya he or karaara hamalaa bolaa he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray said that the government's decision to cut the trees of Aarey Colony is a dictatorial act
 aditya thakare ne kaha, ‘ham metro chaahate hai
 Aarey Colony is not just an issue of 2700 trees, but it is an issue of the entire ecosystem
 aare colony mithi nadi kaa maidan bhi he
 If there is a flood here tomorrow, who will be blamed for it? Unscientific approach is being adopted here
 'is dauraan aditya thakare ne sawaal uthaate hue sarkaar se poocha ki agar aapane court main cese jeet liya he, to raat ko hi ped kyon kaat rahe hai? aapane 2700 pedo ko kaatane ke liye saikadon pulicekarmiyon ko kyon tainaat kiya he? aap 21 saal ke yuvak ko giraftaar kar rahe hai
 This is a shameful behavior of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited
 unhone kaha ki echosystem ko nasht karne vaale adhikariyon ko pioke bhej dena chahie
 Instead of destroying the ecosystem, such officers should use pok to get rid of terrorists
 unhone kaha ki ye adhikari adhikariyon kii tarah bartaav karne kii bajaay netaa banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 What is the whole matter? Let me tell you that there is a riot regarding the Aarey Colony of Mumbai
 ek taraf wo log hai jo mumbai main aare colony main lage pedo ko bachaane ke liye ji jaan lagaae hue hai, duusari taraf sarkaar he jo aare colony ke dhai hajaar se zyada pedo ko katkar vahaan par metro pariyojna se judi parking shed bananaa chaahati he
 At present, the process of cutting trees is going on and the protesters have been sent to jail
 hoicourt se nahin mili rahatisase pehle log bombai hoicourt ke daravaaje is ummid ke saath pahunche the ki hoicourt sarkaar ko aadesh de de ki aare ke ped na kaate jaaen
 But it was reversed and the High Court dismissed the petition saying that the matter is already in the NGT and the Supreme Court
 idhar hoicourt kii tippanee ai or udhar ratorat ladaai ekatarfa ho gai
 a group of uniformed men gathered at Aarey Colony
 aariyon ke saath puri fouj pahunch gai or aare ke pedo ko kaatane kaam shuru ho gaya
 29 people were sent to jail after this, there was outrage in front of the police
 ek ek tahani ko bachaane ke liye log police ke saamne aa gaye
 The ruckus continued throughout the night on Friday
 is dauraan police ne kai logon ko hiraasat main le liya
 29 people were also arrested
 iske baad giraftaar logon ko shanivaar ko court main pesh kiya gaya, jahaan se unako 14 din ke liye nyaayik hiraasat main jail bhej diya gaya
 Now the issue is that many of those who have been sent to jail are students

 (input bhashaa se) The Election Commission's General Observer, who was suspended to investigate the helicopter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) in Sambalpur, Odisha, has been sent back to Karnataka in case of violation of rules for SPG security people
 vah karnataka cader ke 1996 batch ke iees adhikari hai
 The Commission suspended its General Supervisor in Sambalpur, Odisha last week for violating its instructions to the SPG security people
 ayog kaa nirdesh he ki espiji suraksha praapt logon kii jaanch naa kii jaae
 Mohammed Mohsin tried to check some material in the Prime Minister's convoy last Tuesday
 piem modi ne beetemangalvaar ko sambalpur main ek raily ko sambodhit kiya tha
 The Election Commission issued an order after the incident, saying that Mohammad Mohsin, the general supervisor of Sambalpur, violated the existing directives of the Election Commission
 vahiin, sutara ke anusaar niyam he ki espiji suraksha praapt logon ko jaanch se chhot milegi
 Being an observer, he should have known this instruction
 nilamban kaa kaaran duty main laaparvaahee he
 After the incident, they were attached to the Sambalpur headquarters
 ab unhen karnataka ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari se sambhddha kar diya gaya he
 a spokesman said that he would remain suspended
 nirvachan ayog ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri samet espiji suraksha praapt logon ko chhot dene kaa aadesh april 2014 main jari kiya gaya
 Election Ayog took action against Mohsin based on the report of the District Collector and Deputy Inspector General of Police
 gauratlab he kipradhanmantri narendra modi ke helicopter kii kathith rup se jaanch karne ke liye nirvachan ayog ne odisha ke general paryvekshak ko beete buudhvaar ko nilambit kar diya tha
 The order issued by the commission said that Mohammad Mohsin, a 1996 batch IAS officer of Karnataka cadre, did not follow the Election Commission directive regarding SPG security
 odisha ke sambalpur main kathith taur par unhone piem modi ke helicopter kii checking kii thi
 On the basis of the report of the District Collector and Director General of Police, the general supervisor of Sambalpur was suspended by the commission a day after the incident
 ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki sambalpur main pradhanmantri ke helicopter kii jaanch karnaa nirvachan ayog ke disha-nirdeshon ke tahat nahin tha
 People with SPG protection are exempted from such investigations
 trephic niyam todane waalon ke khilaaf sakht hui upi sarkardijipi ke aadesh ke mutabik, galati par pulicekarmi bharenge doguna jurmanapradesh ke alag alag hisson main tabadatod kaate ja rahe chalaanutar pradesh main on spot chaalaan ke liye puraani dar hi lagu rahegi
 In fact, the Yogi government set the Motor Vehicle Act rates in June this year
 iske baad in daron main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 This is the reason that the fines of the new Motor Vehicle Act will not apply on the spot, while if the case goes to court, a new rate penalty will have to be paid
 isse pehle uttar pradesh main trephic niyamon ko or sakht banane ke liye pradesh ke dijipi opi singh ne sabhi pulicekarmiyon ko patr likhaa
 In this letter, OP Singh said that if a police officer breaks traffic rules, strict action should be taken against him and he should be charged twice the fine amount
 isamen kaha gaya ki agar koi pulicekarmi niyam todta hua paaya jaae to use doguna jurmaana chukaana hoga
 So that a message goes out in public and the police too are afraid of breaking the motor vehicle law
 bataa den, uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne kendriya motoryan sanshodhan adhinium 2019 ko ek sitambar se lagu kar diya he
 In this case, the Transport Department also issued a notification on 28 August
 nae niyamon ke mutabik trephic niyam kaa ulanghan karne par vaahan chalaane vaale ko ab pehle se kai guna zyada jurmaana degaa dena hoga
 The most important thing is that if a minor is caught while driving a vehicle, then a fine of 25 thousand rupees and the owner of the vehicle will be punished for 3 years
 saath hi us vaahan kaa registration bhi radd kar diya jayega
 There was no penalty for driving a minor first vehicle
 isi tarah se immergency vaahan ko rasta na dene par bhi ab tak koi jurmaana nahin tha lekin aise vaahan ko rasta na dene par 10 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bharna hoga
 a fine of Rs 1000 will be charged instead of Rs 500 for driving without a helmet
 saath hi 3 maheene ke liye driving license nilambit ho jayega

 twitor par die ek intervyuu main priyanka ne kaha ki ek film nirmaataa ne gane main mujhase undervier dikhaane ke liye kaha tha lekin maine us film main kaam karne se manaa kar diya
 Priyanka Chopra told this in a Twitter interview to a prestigious film magazine
 priyanka se jab sawaal poocha gaya ki 'kisi produsar or nirdeshak ne aapse koi aisi baat kahi ho, jo aapako ajeeb lagi ho or apane bare main kahi gai sabase acchhee baat bhi bataaie
 Priyanka wrote in response to this question, 'I was asked to show underwear in the song of a film, so as to attract more viewers towards the film
 haalanki maine iske liye manaa karte hue film hi chhod di
 'priyanka's magazine editor asked this question @ priyankachoprayou can't cop out of this one, the meanest thing a producer or director has told you? The nicest thing someone ever said— j (@jiteshpillaai) September 19, 2014 Priyanka tweeted a reply from Bekki Meanest was that my underwear should show in a song so people would watch the film

 However, 59 percent of the people of Uttar Pradesh are satisfied with the name change
 vahiin, desh ke 40 fisadi or uttar pradesh ke 27 fisadi isse asantusht he
 In this survey, 11 percent of the people in the country and 14 percent of Uttar Pradesh are those who are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
 bataa den, narendra modi sarkaar ne teen dwipon havelor kaa naam swaraj dweep, nil island kaa naam shahid dweep or rosh island kaa naam netaji subhash chandra bose kar diya
 At the same time, Yogi Adityanath government has renamed Allahabad as Prayagraj and Faizabad as Ayodhya
 naam badalane ke baad vipakshi partiyon ne modi or yogi sarkaar ke kadam kii aalochana kii thi
 However, this opposition from opposition parties is not appealing to the public
 ajtak: desh kaa mizaaj - piem modi kaa pradarshnahar jati ke log naam badalane se santusht28 disambar se 8 janvari ke bich 20 loksabhaa kshetron main 2478 logon par ki gaye is survey ke mutabik, naam badalane se uttar pradesh kii 59 fisadi santusht he, isamen 62 fisadi purush or 53 fisadi mahila shaamil hai
 Satisfied people include people of every caste
 isamen 67 fisadi savarna, 50 fisadi essi / asti or 58 fisadi pichhadi jati ke log hai
 57 percent satisfied with the work of Yogi Apart from this, according to this survey, 57 percent people are satisfied and very satisfied with the work of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath

 40 percent people are satisfied
 vahiin, 27 fisadi log asantusht he
 Out of the five cms in the survey, 40 percent people considered Yogi Adityanath as the best CM

 Whereas, if the Congress also joins with this SP-BSP-RLD, then the bjp's position may be clear
 bijepi ko sirf 5 siten milenge, jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi-congress gathbandhan ko 75 siten mil sakati he
 There was liquor ban in Bihar
 ye kitni safal he or kitni vifal ye bahes kaa mudda ho saktaa he, lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhale hi bhaajapa ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hon lekin sachai he ye bihar ke padosi bhaajapa shasit rajya uttar pradesh or jharkhand main guhaar lagane ke baavjood sharabbandi nahin karvaa paae
 Conversely, liquor shops have increased wildly
 isi ko mudda banaakar shanivaar ko ranchi main apni party dwaara yojit ek kaarykram main nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'yah kya tareeqa he bhai
 
 
 This is such a dirty thing
 ' haalanki nitish ne raghubar das kaa naam nahin liya, lekin unka ishaara saafe tha
 Nitish said that a lot of people are criticizing me, but Bihar has benefited a lot from this (liquor ban) and the revenue loss has been recovered
 nitish ne kaha ki jharkhand main bhi agar janata dal united ko mauqaa mila to vahaan ke paanch nishchay main sharabbandi ko bhi ek nishchay ke rup rakhaa gaya he
 Let me tell you that in view of the Jharkhand assembly elections, Nitish Kumar is active in the state these days
 unhone jharkhand ikai ko chunaav main kitni siton par ladanaa he yaa kiske saath gathbandhan karnaa he, is faisle ke liye adhikrut kiya he
 Nitish Kumar, for the most part of his speech, counted the work done in Bihar and said that all sections of society have developed since his government was formed
 is sambandh main unhone kai aankade bhi die
 He has included five decisions for Jharkhand, including Development Authority for every region, provision of 27 percent reservation for backward and most backward castes on the lines of Bihar, special arrangements for weavers etc
 haalanki nitish kii in ghoshnaaon kaa kitna asar hoga, ye vidhansabha chunaav ke baad hi pataa chalegaa, lekin janata dal united kaa jo sanghathan dhaancha he, usamen filhal is vidhaan sabha chunaav main unke apane party ke netaa maanate hai ki bahut zyaada daal nahin galane vaali he
 Though the party will try to open its account, the truth is that the way BJP has aggressively expanded the work and organization in its government, in the same way, hardly any effective role in Bihar-centric Janata Dal United elections

 jabaki shivasena ke paas sarkaar banane kii chahat ke alaava congress-ensipi kaa in-principal saport yani saidhantik sahyog tha

 That is, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut may be giving a statement against the BJP since the election results, with the NCP and Congress trying to give a new government to Maharashtra, but Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for the first time on this issue from Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi On November 11, met and talked on the phone

 67, sec-c, Vasant Kunj-110070 (nearest St Chattarpur) Land Mark: Opposite to DPS School kundali kaa 12waan bhav ghar kichhatmana gaya he
 If you keep the roof of the house good, then the 12th house is also considered to be good
 ghar kii chat kai prakaar kii hoti he
 When we are talking about the ceiling, it means that one is the ceiling inside your room where there are fans etc
 and the other is the roof which is called Gucci or upper ceiling
 aao jaanate hai ki ghar kii upree chat kisi hona chahie
 The roofs are mainly of three types - flat roof, sloping roof and round roof
 teenon hi chat vaastu anusaar bane to behatar he
 More floors can be built above the flat roof, but this is not possible in sloping roofs
 haalanki kuch makaan aise hote hai jisamen samaat or dhaalu donon hi prakaar kii chhaton kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Sloping roofs are often formed in areas with high rainfall or snowfall
 shaharon main adhiktar sapaat chhaton vaale makaan hote hai
 The thing to keep in mind in these terraces is which side the slope should be
 chat yaa ghar ke farsh kaa dhalaan vaastu anusaar rakhana chahie
 There should be a slope from southwest to north-east
 ghar kii chat kaa dhalaan iske vipareet nahin hona chahie
 Now the question arises what to do if someone has a west or south facing house
 iske liye kisi vaastushastri se milakar sthaan ko dekhakar hi dhalaan kidar hona chahie, yah tay hoga
 There should not be any kind of shaving in the roof of the house
 jaise aajkal ghar kii chat main log do-bai-do kaa ek hissaa khaali chhod dete hai ujaale ke liye
 This will always maintain air pressure in the house, which will have a bad effect on health and mind and brain
 tirchhi chat banane se bachein- chat ke nirmaan main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki vah tirchhi dizin vaali na hon
 This causes other health problems
 ghar kii chat kii oonchai bhi vaastu anusaar hona chahie
 If height 8
 5 foot se kam hoti he to yah aapke liye kai tarah kii samasyaayein lekar aati he or jivan main aage badhanaa aapke liye mushkil ho jayega he
 If the house is small, the ceiling height should be at least 10 to 12 feet
 ghar kii chat par kisi bhi prakaar kii gandagi na karen
 Do not keep any kind of bamboo or waste items here
 jin logon ke gharon kii chat par anupayogi saamaan rakhaa hota he, vahaan nakaaratmak shaktiyaan adhik sakriy rahati hai
 People living in that house have negative views
 parivaar main bhi manmutav kii sthitiyaan nirmit hoti hai
 It is important to know in which direction the water tank is placed on the roof of the house
 uttar-purv disha pani kaa tanks rakhane ke liye uchit nahin he, isse tanaav badhata he or padhane-likhane main bacchon kaa man nahin lagata he
 The south-east direction is the direction of fire, therefore it is also not considered suitable for placing a water tank
 agni or pani kaa mail hone se gambhir vaastudosh utpann hota he
 According to Vastu science, it is auspicious to be higher and heavier than south-west ie south west corner
 kai makaanon main purv yaa uttar disha ke makaanon mentand bana liye jate hai or attala bhar diya jaataa he, jabaki is prakaar karne se anek kashton kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he or hamen iskaa bhaan tak nahin hota he
 It is often seen that whatever is in our house, it is kept in northeast or northeast
 kabhi-kabhi mashin bhi is disha main rakh di jaati he
 In such a situation, we get loss rather than profit and we have to face continuous loss
 ham yadi dakshin-pashchim main taand banaaen to saamaan rakhane main adhik suvidha hokar anaavashyak pareshaaniyon se bachaa ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if the machine or heavy object is kept in south direction from igneous angle to south west angle, then it will run more smoothly

 At the beginning of the speech on this occasion, Lalu attacked Nitish and said that he knew Nitish was not the right man
 padhie nitish ke bare main lalu ke man kii 10 baaten

 2
 nitish kumarper kabhi bharosa nahin tha, lekin sampraadayik takaton ko rokane ke liye baari man se unke saath gaye the
 The public also knows that this man is not worthy of trust
 3

 Sushil Modi was fully aware of this scam
 4
 We have not seen a dal-badlu like Nitish till date
 nitish kumaar ne ye aakhri palati maari he, ab unke saamne koi rasta nahin he
 5
 nitish kumaar ke khilaaf dhara 302 ke tahat cese darj he
 He knows the whole of Bihar

 They were burning inside

 nitish kumaar ne tejasvi ko kalankit karne sajeesh rachi or phir bijepi kii god main jaakar baith gaye
 Nitish was already aware of the raid

 When Nitish falls ill, understand that there is something wrong
 teen baar kol kiye, lekin phone par baat nahin kiya
 We understood that something was wrong
 bihar NDA main chali khinchataan ke baad ab upi kii baari he
 Because Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Ghazipur in UP, bjp's own people have made up their mind to leave
 upi sarkaar main mantri opi rajbhar kii suheldev bhartiya samaaj party or kendriya mantri anupriya patel kii party apana dal gajipur main aaj hone vaali piem modi kii raily main shaamil nahin hogi
 In this rally, PM Modi will issue a postage stamp on Maharaja Suheldev
 bataa den piem modi varanasi or gajipur main aaj rahenge
 This will be the Prime Minister's second visit to his constituency in two months
 varanasi main vah ‘rashtriya beej anusandhan evam prashikshan kendra‘ ke parisar main ‘antarrashtriya chaaval anusandhan santhaan' or ‘dakshin asia kshetreey kendra' ko raashtra ko samarpit karenge
 The official release said that the Rice Research Institute will become a major center for rice research and training in South Asia and SAARC countries
 idhar, suheldev bhartiya samaaj party kaa kahana he ki unki party ke pramukh opi rajbhar ko jo nimantran patr bheja gaya he usamen maharaja suheldev kaa naam puraa nahin likhaa he or jaan boojhkar rajbhar shabd hataa diya gaya he
 OP Rajbhar, a minister in the Yogi government, says that he has neither been invited for this program and is constantly being insulted in the NDA
 vahiin, anupriya patel kii party bhi is kaarykram main shaamil nahin hogi
 For the past few days, it is being told that Anupriya Patel is angry with NDA and accusing BJP of ignoring her
 apana dal kaa kahana he ki uskaa sammaan nahin ho rahaa he
 Let us know that PM Modi will also visit Varanasi today and will talk to the weavers and entrepreneurs there
 is dauraan alag-alag rin yojanaon main kareeb 1000 labhaarthiyon ko do hazaar karod rupee rin sweekruti kii ghoshnaa bhi karenge
 PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone of Ghazipur Medical College, but Union Health Minister Anupriya Patel will not attend this program
 unhone is puure kaarykram se apni duuri banaae rakhane kaa elaan kiya he
 His party president Ashish Patel said that he has been invited to the foundation stone program of Medical College in Ghazipur, but Anupriya Patel is not attending it
 gauratlab he ki apana dal es endie kaa mahatvapurn ghatak he or centre va pradesh kii sarkaron main saajheedaar bhi dal kii naaraazgi beete 25 disambar ko tab ubhar kar saamne ai jab siddharth nagar main rajya kii medical college ke shilanyas kaarykram main anupriya patel ko aamantrit nahin kiya gaya
 While Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey was called
 iske baad hi apana dal ne bhaajapa ke kisi bhi kaarykram main shaamil hone kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Later BJP leaders admitted their lapses but the party's resentment has not diminished
 yah sach he ki gathbandhan main har party kii apni majbootee hoti he, lekin bijepi kii apane boote kii taiyaari bhi bahut acchhee he
 The seats should be claimed on the basis of reality, if anyone has problems then we also have no option
 lekin sahyogi dalon ko pataa he ki bijepi ke saath rahenge to hi phayda he
 "this attitude of a senior BJP leader is after the big claims made by the allies for the Bihar elections, in which the BJP has claimed seats by exaggerating itself with the intention of contesting the old 102 seats
" lekin bijepi tab tak apane pattey nahin kholana chaahati jab tak bihar main 28 agast tak chalane vaali parivartan yatra or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii 1 sitambar ko bhagalpur main hone vaali raily sampann nahin ho jaati
 The seat sharing between the constituents of the NDA may be booming, but the BJP is not in a hurry
 bihar bijepi ke prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav india today se kehete hai, “abhi sahyogi dalon se anaupchaarik charchaa hui he, parivartan raily ke baad hi siton par aupchaarik charchaa hogi
 The number of seats is not yet decided, but everything will be done in a positive way
 ” lekin ghatak dalon main bechaini kii badi vajah asahaj maane jane vaale nitish-lalu-congress mahagathbandhan main siton kaa bantwaaraa sahajata se hona he
 Referring to this, Upendra Kushwaha, president of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Minister of State for Human Resource Development in the Modi government, says, "the more the delay in seat sharing, the more we are lagging behind in a strategy that is not appropriate for the alliance
" is bare main jald faisla hona chahie
 "BJP is the most feared Kushwaha who is claiming 67 seats for his party, while LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan, who is considered a trusted constituent of BJP 66, is the former Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (WE) President Jeetan Ram Manjhi 75" The list of seats has been handed over to the BJP high command
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki ghatak dalon kii ye maangen kahin se bhi yathartwaadee nahin dikhti kyonki 243 siton main se ye dal 208 siton par daawa kar rahe hai
 Actually, the BJP is working on a dual strategy by realizing the game of pressure politics
 ek, vah pradhanmantri modi kii raily se pehle kisi tarah kaa matbhed nahin chaahati or duusare, siton ke bantwaare main deree karke aisi sthiti bana di jaae ki ankhen dikhaane vaale sahyogiyon ke paas endie main bane rahane ke alaava koi vikalp na bache
 In the Bihar assembly elections, which have become a question of prestige, the BJP is making a strategy to touch the magic figure of 122 necessary for its strong majority
 uske ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki jaadui aankade tak pahunchane ke liye kam se kam use 170-175 siton par laduya hoga
 In such a situation, there are only 73 seats left for the constituents
 lekin jati sameekaran kaa guladasta na bikhare, iske liye bijepi 150-160 siton par ladgaye tak jhuk sakati he
 But according to sources, in this situation some candidates from BJP will be given to constituents who will contest on the election symbol of regional parties
 bijepi ne shuruaati formula loksabhaa siton ke aadhaar par diya tha&yani teen loksabhaa seat vaali araspi ko 18 or algepi ko 40-42 siten
 But according to RLSP sources, Kushwaha will not consider below 38 seats in any case, while BJP believes that Kushwaha does not have the option and if he adopts a rebel attitude then Amit Shah can refuse very aggressive attitude in such cases
 As he adopted in the Maharashtra elections
 bijepi bhi maan rahi he ki kushvaha gathbandhan se alag nahin honge, lekin rajnatik sambhaavnaaon ko dekhte hue party ne apni duusari ranneeti bhi taiyaar rakhi he
 If Kushwaha separates, BJP will give more importance to "us" because Shakuni Chaudhary, who has influence in Kushwaha society, is the state president of Manjhi's party
 dilli vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor or bihar kii jatigat raajnneeti ke jaankaar dow
 Subodh Kumar says, "if Kushwaha separates from NDA, BJP will not suffer
 uski bharpai maanjhi ke aane se puri ho jaati he
 He says, "looking at the history of 15 assembly elections in Bihar so far, usually Koiri and Bhumihar have been emotionally with the BJP
 kushvaha ko loksabhaa main jo phayda mila vah bijepi kii vajah se mila
 On the other hand, 11 per cent of Mahadalit and 6 per cent of Paswan votes can go to the NDA account
 ”haalanki bijepi ke liye kushvaha ke alaava mushkil paswan kheme se bhi he kyonki jedy(you) se tuutakar maanjhi kii “ham” ke saath jude kuch vidhayakon ko tikat die jane ko lekar algepi sansadeey board ke adhyaksh chiraag paswan ne shah ke saamne apni aapatti darj kara di he
 These people were with Paswan in 2005, but were changed after the elections
 haalanki bijepi kaa maananaa he ki paswan ko manaaya ja saktaa he
 But on their behalf, BJP has also been told that if 40-45 seats are given to Kushwaha, then it should also be given respectable seats as a big ally
 sutron ke mutabik, gathbandhan ke tahat seat bantwaare main algepi ko 40-45 siten di ja sakati hai
 Nandkishore Yadav, Leader of the Opposition on the ongoing tussle in the alliance, says, "because of the Parivartan Yatra, senior leaders are on tour, so we have not met
" ” bihar bijepi ke pravaktaa devesh kumaar kaa bhi maananaa he ki gathbandhan main koi dikkat nahin aane vaali or samay aane par siton kaa talmail ho jayega
 The BJP is yet to determine the seats in the coalition, but it is trying to give the JD (U) seat to the constituents, keeping away allies in its old 102 seats
 iske alaava party ne bihar ke sabhi 38 jilon main kam se kam ek seat par gathbandhan ke kisi na kisi sahyogi ko utaarne kii bhi ranneeti banaai he
 Apparently, the BJP, which is stuck in the dilemma of projecting face in the Bihar elections, is now looking at the seats
 use ashanka he ki trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main endie kaa koi ek ghatak lalu-nitish kheme kii ore jhuk saktaa he
 That is why the party is blowing every step of its way
 gujarat kii 4 vidhansabha siton par up-chunaavon kaa elaan21 oktober ko voting or 24 oktober ko aaenge nattijeychunaav ayog ne maharashtra or haryana main vidhansabha chunaavon kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya he
 Also, the assembly byelection dates have been announced in 17 states including Gujarat
 yahaan 21 oktober ko vot daale jaaenge or 24 taarikh ko nattejey ghoshit honge
 There are 9 seats vacant in the 182-member Gujarat Legislative Assembly, of which 4 seats will go to the by-elections
 2019 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main tharad, lunavada, kheraalu or amaraiwadi vidhansabha seat ke vidhayakon ne jeet darj kii thi
 After this all 4 seats were vacant
 inhen 4 siton par vidhansabha ke upachunaav honge
 Let us know that BJP candidates won these four seats in the assembly elections
 radhanpur, bid or morava hadaf siten bhi philhal khaali hai
 The seat is vacant after the resignation of Thakor leader Alpesh Thakor from Radhanpur, while Alpesh's colleague Dhawal Singh Jhala from the Byd seat also resigned
 iske alaava morava hadaf seat se congress vidhayak par jhootha jati pramaan patr dene kaa aarope he jiske kaaran is seat kaa maamla aaj bhi nyaayi prakriya main fansaa hua he
 The by-election dates were not announced for these three seats
 koun ho sakate hai ummidavaar?chaar vidhansabha siton kii baat karen to tharad vidhansabha seat se BJP ke purv mantri shankar choudhary ko tikat milane kii sambhaavna zyada he
 But some state leaders of BJP are against him
 aise main tharad se BJP ke purv rajya mantri or vartmaan saansad parbat patel ke bete ko tikat diya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, after winning the assembly elections from Kheralu seat, only members of former minister Shankarji's family, who won the Lok Sabha elections, have been contesting elections and their dominance is very high
 aise main phir ek baar shankaraji ke parivaar se hi kisi ko umidavaar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Hasmukh Patel was the MLA on Amraiwadi seat who has become an MP by winning Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and this seat is considered the safest seat of BJP
 yahaan ummidavaaron kii list kaaphi lambi he, lekin patidaaron ke prabhutv vaali is seat par kisi patidaar ko hi tikat milane kii sambhaavna he
 The Lunavada seat was won by Independent candidate Ratan Singh, who later joined the BJP and has now become an MP
 aise main ratan singh ke gut main se hi kisi ko tikit diya ja saktaa he
 The results of the elections held in 2017 on 4 seats

 Akshay has made a lot of headlines earlier due to the non-political interview of PM Modi
 iaiti ke liye 30 garib chaatro ko muft koching dene vaali kaamyaab sanstha super30 ke founder anand kumaar ne skill deveopment ke maamle main sawaal uthaaya he
 a child coming from Hindi speaking areas struggles with that language before understanding the mystery of the subjects taught in English
 sarkaar is samasya kaa kya karegi
 If we look at the National Skill Development Policy, the Government of India has targeted to give skill to 50 crore people by 2022
 yani saat karod logon ko har saal skild kiya jayega
 Of this, about 95 percent will be from unorganized sectors
 india today conklev main aae skill deveopment vibhaag ke mantri rajeev pratap rudi kehete hai ki sarkaar ko zyada jor majdoor, chota str par kaarobaar karne vaale or mahilaon par he
 That is why more focus is placed on unorganized sectors
 hamaare desh main hindi pehali bhashaa he yaa nahin, is par vivaad ho saktaa he, lekin angraji duusari bhashaa (second language) he yah nirvivaad he
 But the second language has its own problems
 angreji ko duusari bhashaa ke taur par jaanane vaale 400 logon kaa survey kiya gaya, inamen 71 fisadi logon ko bolne vaale kaa uccharan samajhane main pareshaani hoti he
 45 per cent had trouble understanding the new word
 30 fisadi ko tej angreji bole jane par vah samaj nahin ai
 And 18 percent concentration could not be achieved
 is survey yah samaj main aa gaya ki shahari maahaul main jahaan, kaamkaaj teji se angreji kii ore bad rahaa he, vahaan baaki bhashaa jaanane waalon ke liye aise vishay dur hote chale jaaenge, jinamein angreji kaa gyaan sabase zyada jaruri he
 Especially computer work
 to phir skill deveopment kiske liye hoga?badhai ke liye, juuta banane vaale ke liye yaa jo aisi hi koi kaarigari karnaa chahta he uske liye
 If the government considers only those living in villages or laborers eligible for skill development, then it is a different matter
 kyonki jis tarah se skill deveopment kii baat kii ja rahi he, uskaa aashay to bheed ko line main khadaa hone kaa salika sikhaane jaisaa prathit ho rahaa he
 It is a long way, we have to wait

 aparaadh kii duniya main yah tikdi beete kuch dinon se haivaaniyat kaa paryaay ban chuki hai
 The story of rape, murder and bullying in the country's largest populous state, has made the soil of this state that created history ever soaked with black ink
 ek hafte ke andar do pedo se chaar laashen mil chuki hai to jameen par bahan-betiyon kii aabru luti ja rahi he
 On Thursday, two dead bodies were found hanging on a tree again in UP
 jaahir he aise main sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki rajya kii kanoon-vyavastha bhi to kahin ped par hi nahin he, kyonki ek taraf ped par laashen mil rahi hai to duusari taraf jameen par aabru luti ja rahi he
 The latest case is from Deoria district, where a dead body of a newly married couple has been found hanging from a tree
 shaq he ki maamla honor kiling kaa he
 After the dead, who died from another village, in Pipari village of Deoria Thursday morning, when the people of the village woke up to sleep, they are shocked to see that two dead bodies are hanging from the peepal tree just outside the village
 hairaani kii baat ye thi ki marane vaale donon is gaanv ke nahin
 Neither did anyone know them
 donon kii laash pipal ke ped kii tahani se ek hi rassi par jhul rahi thi
 That is, the noose was inserted around the neck of the two ends of the same rope
 pehali najar main dekh kar aisa hi lag rahaa tha maanon donon ne khudakushi kii he
 But when the police reached the spot and the corpse was brought down, the visitors were surprised
 donon ke munh main plastic or kapadaa thunsaa hua tha taaki wo cheekh naa saken
 Obviously, the suicidal person will not put plastics or cloth in his mouth with his own hands
 aakhir kisne or kyon kii hatya?ped se laashon ko utaarne ke baad jab police ne aasapaas kii talaashi lee to thodi duuri par pani kaa bottle or juute-chappal pade mili
 These shoes and slippers were of those who died
 police ne laash ko utraane ke baad postmortem ke liye bhej diya he, lekin shuruaati tafteesh se yahi lagata he ki katl karne ke baad donon kii laashen ped se lataka di gayi
 Now the question is, if this newly married couple is murdered, then who murdered? And why? Is it the result of mutual family enmity, conspiracy of irregulars or the case of honor killing? The tree from which the dead bodies of both have been hanging is very high
 khaas kar us tahani kii jisase donon jhul rahe the
 The police did not find any such thing around the tree, so that it can be estimated that both of them have reached the branch with their support
 katl ke peeche pyaar kii kahani to nahin
 
 
 The two dead bodies hanging from the tree belong to 24-year-old Nagendra and 22-year-old Mamta
 devaria ke sidva gaanv kaa rahane vaala nagendra pados kii gaanv pattharadev main rahane vaali mamata se pyaar karata tha
 Their love lasted for two years
 donon shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 But both their families were not ready for marriage
 baad main nagendra or mamata ke dabaav ke aage donon parivaar maan gaya or pichley maheene hi ek may ko donon kii shaadi ho gai
 Nagendra used to work welding in a private company in Karnataka
 shaadi ke baad mamata apane maayke chali gai thi
 Nagendra, who took Mamta back from her in-laws, reached Patchathardeva village on June 4
 subah kareeb das baje ke aasapaas wo apni bivi mamata ko saath lekar apane gaanv ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 But even after the end of the day, he did not reach his home barely 15 kilometers from his in-laws' house
 iske baad paanch june kii subah kareeb chah baje nagendra or mamata kii laash pipara gaanv main ped se lataki mili
 Police is currently awaiting a post-mortem report in the case
 police kaa kahana he ki report aane ke baad sara sach saamne aa jayega
 The report will reveal how both of them have died
 Is it a case of suicide or murder? Police suspect the case Honor Killing Police According to sources, after knowing the story of Nagendra and Mamta, the police also suspect that the case is of honor killing
 lihaaja police donon ke ghar waalon se poochtacha kar rahi he
 According to the police, Nagendra has his old parents and a brother in his house
 shaq he ki agar yah honor kiling he to ladki ke ghar vaale isamen shaamil ho sakate hai
 It is said that in the last one week, Akhilesh government has asked to solve the matter seriously and soon after seeing the uproar over the law and order situation in the state

 Like years of pain was flowing from both eyes
 ye aword seremani madras main yojit tha
 Bachchan Rekha passed away in financial crisis
 rekha ko behad kam umr main kaam karnaa padaa
 In the early days he also acted in b and c grade films of Telugu
 rekha ne bollywood main kareeb 4 dashak tak kaam kiya
 His pairing with Amitabh was considered superhit
 filmon main shoshan kaa shikaar huimahaj 15 saal kii umr main unhone 'anjaanaa safar' se bollywood main debyue kiya tha
 During, where something happened along the line that was extremely painful

 He suffered this pain at the age of just 15
 film 'anjaanaa safar' kii shooting ke dauraan ek romantic gane ke shoot ke liye rekha set par pahunchi thim
 As soon as the director spoke the action, the film's hero Biswajit started kissing him on the lips
 ye kis 5 minute tak chalata rahaa
 During this time the camera continued to roll
 diarector ne cat nahin bolaa
 Unit members were whistling
