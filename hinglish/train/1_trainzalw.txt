 cricket kii duniya main ek kahawat he,'caches vin maches'
 The players of the teams who have won in cricket have caught many catches which have turned the match dice
 inamen se ek kaich aisa tha jisane world cap kii trophy bharat kii jholii main daal di
 All-rounder and captain Kapil Dev made a brilliant game against the West Indies in 1983
 unhone madan laal kii ek swing karti gend par daudte hue ek kaich pakadaa or bharat kii jeet aasaan kar di
 This catch was of great batsman Viv Richards
 is kaich ko pakadaney ke liye kapil ne lambii daud lagaai or gend par apni najar gadaaye rakhi
 The catch was such that it changed the direction of victory and snatched the cup from the West Indies team
 is baar australia or south africa ko world cap kaa jabardast daavedaar mana ja rahaa he or iskaa kaaran bhi yahi he
 The great player of his time, Jairn Lehman, says, "history is a testimony that if your team does the best fielding then it is a great chance for you to win the World Cup
 ' isliye australia ko iskaa prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 Similarly, South Africa is also not less than anyone in the field of fielding
 uske sabhi khilaadi behtareen fielding karte hai or amuman koi kaich chhodte nahin
 It is to South Africa that he has set a new standard for fielding in international cricket
 chitah jaisi furti vaale jonty rods ko bhala koun bhul saktaa he jo ballebaaj ke balle se gend takaraate hi use pakad sakate the! unhone sari duniya main fielding kaa standard ooncha kar diya
 Jonty Rhodes was also the coach of the Indian cricket team
 unki dekh rekh main viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, gautam gambhir vagairah ne apni fielding kaa str badhaayaa he
 Gautam Gambhir is now out of the team
 lekin baaki donon team main hai
 Virat's fielding has been excellent but for the last few days he is not seeing any lightning fast
 unke liye yah jaruri he ki apni fielding ko or majboot karen kyonki bhartiya team is samay ghaatak gendbaajon kii kami se jujh rahi he
 Apart from Virat and Dhawan, Jadeja has also been doing great fielding
 unase bhi kaaphi ummiden hai
 This time India's problem is its bowling
 uske paas aisa koi gendbaaj nahin he jo kahar barapa de
 In such a situation, the responsibility of fielders increases
 ek bhi kaich chhodana mahangaa pad saktaa he
 Every player has to be chalk-proof and will have to give extra in their fielding
 har kaich, chaahe vah kitna bhi mushkil kyon na ho, lapaknaa hoga
 This time we will also miss Yuvraj Singh, who is a great fielder
 unki anupasthiti main ab yah daaromadar jadeja par he jo badhiya fielding karte hai
 Mohammad Kaif of India holds the record for most catches in a World Cup match
 unhone 2002-03 world cap main srilanka ke khilaaf khele gaye vanade main chaar kaich liye
 Fielding like Eknath Solkar of Team India and Cheetah of Yajuvendra Singh kept India in trouble
 bharat ke purv captain mohammad ajaharuddin ne bhi ek pari main paanch kaich lene kaa ek record banaaya tha
 If India has to win this cup then all the players have to take care that no catches are missed
 har chuta hua kaich use cap se dur karata jayega

 According to Vedic tradition and Hindu beliefs, shraddha is a great and excellent work for fathers with reverence
 manyata ke mutabik putr kaa putratv tabhi sarthak mana jaataa he jab vah apane jivan kaal main jivit mata-pita kii seva karen or unke maranoparant unki mrityu tithi (barsi) tathaa mahalay (pitrupaksh) main uskaa vidhivat shraadh karen
 From Ashwin Krishna Paksha Pratipada to Amavasya of Ashwin month, it has been called Pitrupaksha or Mahalaya Paksha
 manyata ke anusaar pindadaan moksh prapti kaa ek sahaj or saral maarg he
 In such places, in many places including Haridwar, Gangasagar, Kurukshetra, Chitrakoot, Pushkar, God offers salvation to the ancestors with revered shraddha, but Lord Rama has also praised the glory of Shraddha performed in Gaya
 kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan ram or sitaaji ne bhi raja dasharath kii aatma kii shanti ke liye gaya main hi pindadaan kiya tha
 According to the Acharyas, it is a common belief in the public that only one 'gaya' from a family
 gaya karne kaa matlab he ki gaya main pitaron ko shraadh karnaa, pindadaan karnaa
 It is written in the Garuda Purana that every step one walks on leaving the house to go to Gaya becomes one step each for the ascension of the ancestors
 'grihachchalitamaatrasya gayaayan gamnan prati
 Swargaharanasopanam Pitrinam Tu pade-pade 'gaya ko vishnu kaa nagar mana gaya he
 It is called the land of salvation
 vishnu puraana or vaayu puraana main bhi isaki charchaa kii gai he
 According to Vishnu Purana, by performing pindadan in Gaya, the ancestors get salvation and they go to heaven
 mana jaataa he ki swayan vishnu yahaan pitru devtaa ke rup main maujuud hai, isliye ise 'pitru tirth' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Panda Ramananda of Gaya says that a pinddaan cannot be done on the banks of the Phalgu river without pindadan
 pindadaan kii prakriya punpun nadi ke kinare se prarambh hoti he
 In this way, pinddaan is done with pratipada, but many people also start pindadaan from full moon day
 puranic manyataon or kiwandantiyon ke anusaar bhasmasur ke vansh main gayasur naamak rakshas ne kathin tapasya kar brahmaji se vardaan maanga tha ki uskaa sharir devataaon kii tarah pavitra ho jaae or log uske darshan maatr se paap mukt ho jaaen
 After receiving this boon, the population of heaven began to increase and everything happened contrary to natural law
 leg bina bhay ke paap karne lage or gayasur ke darshan se paap mukt hone lage
 In order to avoid this, the gods asked for the sacred site for Yajna from gayasur
 gayasur ne apana sharir devataaon ke yajna ke liye de diya
 When Gaiasur lay, his body spread into five Kos
 yahi paanch kos kii jagah aage chalakar gaya bani parantu gayasur ke man se logon ko paap mukt karne kii ichha nahin gai or phir usne devataaon se vardaan maanga ki yah sthaan logon ko taarane (mukti) vaala bana rahe
 Those who pind daan here with the desire to pay someone, they will get liberation
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi log apane pitaron ko taarane ke liye pindadaan ke liye gaya aate hai
 Gaya is said to have previously had 360 altars of various names, where Pindadan was performed
 inamen se ab 48 hi bachi hai
 However many religious institutions are demanding the discovery of those old altars
 vartmaan samay main inhen vediyon par log pitaron kaa tarpan or pindadaan karte hai
 Millions of people from India and abroad visit Gaya every year for pindadan

 Kasab will now be kept in the safest egg cell of Arthur Road Jail
 jahaan sabase khoonkhaar or shaatir aparaadhiyon kaid hai

 The design of the rooms is such that any prisoner can neither see nor talk to the other
 anda cell main laate vakt kaidi kaa cheharaa kapade se dhak diya jaataa he taaki baaki kaidi ye naa jaan saken ki cell main aane vaala nayaa kaidi koun he

 India knows the value of losing the only terrorist alive in the Mumbai attack

 Kasab may also have some more concrete information related to the Mumbai attack and terrorists, which the ATS wants to extricate from him

 ballebaaji ke badshaah sachin tendulkar ke ricard 51wein test shatak or harbhajan singh ke do jhatkon ke dam par bharat ne mangalvaar ko dakshin africa ko baikfoot par bhejkar tisare or antim test cricket match main apni sthiti majboot kar lee
 Tendulkar scored 146 runs for which he spent 465 minutes at the crease and meanwhile faced 314 balls with 17 fours and two sixes
 unki is pari se bharat 364 ran banaakar do ran kii maamuli badhat hasil karne main kaamyaab rahaa
 South Africa, who scored 362 runs in their first innings, had scored 52 for two by the end of the third day's play and they still have a 50-run lead
 teesraa din tendulkar ke naam rahaa jinhone shrinkhalaa main doosraa shatak jamaakar bharatiyon kaa palada baari kar diya
 He meanwhile shared 176 runs for the third wicket with Gautam Gambhir (93) and 76 runs for the seventh wicket with Harbhajan Singh (40)
 del sten dakshin africa ke sabase safal gendbaaj rahe
 He took five wickets for 75 runs
 dakshin africa ko smith (29) or elviro petersan ne acchhee shuruyaat di lekin harbhajan ne din kaa khel samaapt hone se kuch der pehle bharat ko 11 ged ke andar do safaltaaen dilaayi
 Smith wanted to play his Goodlength ball on the back foot but he missed it and returned to the pavilion lbw
 iske baad nitwachaman paal haris (shunya) ko unki gend nahin khilne kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa or vah bhi pagabaadha out ho gayi
 Hashim Amla was playing with Pietersen (22 not out) at the time of the stumps, who are yet to open their account
 tendulkar ne sten kii gend par hi ek ran lekar apana 50waan ran puraa kiya
 After this the star batsman however froze and he put some good shots on both sides of the crease
 gambhir bhi dhire-dhire shatak kii taraf bad rahe the lekin vah nervas ninties kaa shikaar hokar pavilion laute
 Gambhir tried to play the left-arm spinner Paul Harris 'rough area' ball on the backfoot but it took the edge of his bat and reached to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher
 gambhir ne apni pari main 222 gend kheli tathaa 13 chauke lagaaye
 VVS Laxman (15), who replaced Gambhir, looked in good rhythm
 unhone aate hi teen chauke jamaaye lekin unhen bade hi durbhagyapurna dhang se ran out hokar pavilion lautnaa padaa
 Ironically, then Harris dropped Tendulkar's catch but Laxman was run out
 tendulkar ne aage badhkar shaat jamaaya lekin gendbaaj haris us par keval haath hi sparsh kar paye
 Laxman was then out of the crease and the ball hit the wicket at the non-striker end
 sten ne agle over main hi dhoni ko out kar diya 
 The ball was then swinging out of the stumps with a swift swing which the Indian captain tried to play but took the edge of his bat and reached Ashwell Prince in the third slip
 harbhajan ne shuru main kuch teji dikhaayi lekin baad main unhone bhi tendulkar kii tarah tikkar khilne ko tarjeeh di jisase bharat duusare satr main 25 over main 79 ran hi bana paaya
 Harbhajan, meanwhile, completed 2000 runs in Test cricket with a six over Stan's Gayd
 tendulkar ne chaay ke vishram ke baad haris ko isi tarah kaa sabak sikhaaya
 Stan broke this partnership by dismissing Harbhajan
 harbhajan ne bounsar par pul karne kii koshish kii lekin vah unke balle par sahi tarah se nahin aayi or deep squaire leg main sthanapann kshetrarakshak je pi dumini ne daudkar use kaich me tabdeel kar diya
 Harbhajan's 67-ball innings included three fours and two sixes
 tendulkar kii dhaiypurna pari kaa ant aakhir main morkal ne kiya jinaki gend unke balle kaa chhakaati hui aaf stump ukhaad gayi
 After this, it was not late for the Indian innings

 Then within minutes, Nitish government also announced to increase the dearness allowance by 6% of all Bihar government employees and pensioners
 yani votaron ko lubhaane kii kavayad chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke pehle aakhri minute tak chalati rahi
 Earlier, the central government had cleared the way for the supply of coal to the flood thermal power plant of Bihar
 cabinet kii ek ahm baithak ke baad bijli mantri piyush goyal ne elaan kiya ki bihar ke baadh main antipisi ke thermal power plant ko ab kol linkage ke jariye koyale kii pakki supplai kii suvidha muhaiyaa karai jayega

 Such a script of death has rarely been written before
 script main jo jo or jaise jaise likhaa gaya, har kisi ke hisse main vaise vaise hi maut ai
 Unemployment, sickness, starvation, stress, pressure, stress are usually the reasons why people commit suicide
 magar is kahani main maut kii vajah bhi ajeeb or maut kaa tarika bhi anokhaa
 Screw so much that it is difficult to find out who put the noose around whose neck and who moved the stool from under whose feet
 jaisi script waisi maut!1
 Choose Thursday or Sunday and they chose Sunday only
 2
 Bandages on the eyes are to be tied well
 shunya ke alaava kuch bhi nahin dikhnaa chahie
 Use cotton saris or saris with rope
 or unhone aisa hi kiya
 9 of the eleven people had bandages on their eyes
 3
 Worship is to be done continuously after seven days
 thodaa lagan or shraddha se kerani he puja
 But if someone comes into the house, the next day
 or unhone aisa hi kiya
 Worship marks have been found in the house before death

 If the babe cannot stand, she can lie down in a separate room

 6
 haathon kii pattiyaan agar batch jaaen, to unhen ankhon par dabl kar lenaa
 And literally 8 people had their hands tightly tied at the back, many had double bandages on their eyes
 7
 Double the mouth bandages with handkerchiefs
 or sachmuch parivaar ke kai sadasyon ke munh par dabl rumal bandhe the
 8
 jitani dridhtaa or shraddha dikhaaoge, utana hi uchit fal milegaa
 And all the 11 people living in this house died simultaneously
 9
 Work is to be done between 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the night and before that a havan is to be done
 or sabaki maut aadhi raat ko hi hui
 Havan-poojan was also found

 Everyone should have the same thinking

 register ne uljhaayaa maut kaa rahasyadilli ke buraadi ilaake ke ek makaan main hui gyaarah samuhik mauton ne sirf dilli hi nahin, puure desh ko dahala diya
 But a register and a diary recovered from this house with eleven deaths have deepened the mystery of these deaths
 ye register ghar main puja vaali jagah par rakhaa hua mila
 In this, the way to commit suicide to attain salvation was written
 ittefaq se register main jo-jo or jaisi-jaisi baaten likhi thim, ghar ke halaat or vahaan hui mautein thik waisi hi thim
 The Tantra mantra behind the mass deaths? Writing in this register with a single handwriting began in December 2017, while on June 26, four pages of this register were filled together
 register main hi 30 june ko bhagwaan se milane jane kii baat likhi thi
 And these deaths also occurred on the intervening night of 30 June and 1 July
 to kya in gyaarah mauton kii vajah tantra-mantra ke zarie moksh prapti kii koshish rahi? yaa phir iskaa raaj kuch or he? agar, mautein tantra-mantra kii vajah se hi hui hai, to phir wo shaks koun he jo inhen tantra-mantra or maut kaa tareeqa bataa rahaa tha?11 mauton ke peeche 2 yaa 3 logaye cese apane aap main sabase ajeeb he
 Strange because 11 people from a family should be ready to die together to achieve salvation in this era
 paramatma se milane ke liye
 It does not seem possible
 dilli police kii jaanch bhi lagbhag yahi kahati he
 Police say that 2 or 3 people are behind these 11 deaths
 baaki logon ko kisi galatfahami main rakhkar yaa dhokhaa dekar maut ke ghat utaara gaya he
 The three corpses had their hands open
 11 people can stand at a time and commit suicide by themselves, the answer is no
 to phir sawaal he ki is ghar main aisa kaise ho gaya
 The answer to this question is finding the dead bodies themselves
 darasal, jo 11 laashen mili hai, unamem 3 teen laashen aisi thim, jinke donon haath khule hue the
 One of them was Lalit, the second was Lalit's wife Tina and the third was Lalit's brother Bhuvanesh
 agar police kii maane to is ghar main sabase pehali maut lalit kii bujurg maa kii hui
 After this, the other one was killed in turn
 or phir tina kii baari ai
 After Tina, Bhuvanesh and then the last who died was Lalit himself
 ankhon, munh par pattee thi bandhiburadi ke us makaan main kareeb 15 feet chaude or 20 feet lambey ek haul main ek saath das logon kii laashen chat par lagi jaali se jhul rahi thim
 While the body of an aged 77-year-old woman lay in bed in a room in the same floor
 yani ek saath kul gyaarah laashen
 Of the eleven people who died, 8 had their hands tied backwards, while nearly all of them had their eyes and mouth bandaged and a cotton swab in their ears
 sirf bujurg narayani devi ke do beton bhuwanesh or lalit or lalit kii bivi tina ke haath hi khule the
 Suspecting Lalit, Tina and Bhuvnesh The policemen who arrived at the scene in this way, first came to the open hands of the bodies of Bhuvnesh, Lalit and Tina
 philhal maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi police ko shaq he ki shaayad in teenon ne milakar parivaar ke baaki aath logon kii jaan lee or phir ant main khud bhi inhone khudakushi kar lee
 a diary found in this house and the things written in the register create suspicion behind these deaths, Tantra Mantra and suicide for salvation
 lekin sawaal ye bhi he ki akhir ek saath itane log khudakushi ke liye taiyaar kaise ho sakate hai? aise main shaq khule haathon vaale bhuwanesh, lalit or tina par hi jaataa he
 Lalit and tinapulis were very religious, according to the sources, both Lalit and Tina were of a very religious type and were great devotees of Balaji
 shaayad inhone hi bhuwanesh ke saath milakar moksh prapti ke liye qatl or khudakushi kaa puraa plan taiyaar kiya
 Since not all the people of the family could be prepared for this, the remaining eight people were murdered by deception
 is kadi main sabase pehle bebbe yani 77 saal kii bujurg maa narayani devi kii jaan lee gai
 While the rest of the people came after him
 in sabhi kii ankhon or munh par pattee baandh di gai, jabaki haath peeche baandhe gaye
 Oath to complete the method! The police suspect that they were probably blindfolded and hand tied backwards as a process and swore to complete this method
 shaq he ki shaayad inhen ye kaha gaya ki is prakriya se guzarane ke kuch der baad sab kuch saamaanya ho jayega
 But after this they were deceitfully executed by hanging
 police kii maane to iske baad bhuwanesh or tina ne khudakushi kii ore phir sabase akhir main lalit ne bhi apni jaan de di
 According to the initial post-mortem report received by the police, all of them have been said to have died of suffocation due to the sores in the throat
 jo latakati laashon kii theory se mail khaati hai
 At present, the police are investigating several angles
 sorain ne bataaya ki shanivaar subah unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii

 While giving a statement on the incident in Hyderabad, Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan told the Rajya Sabha that the people involved in the incident in Hyderabad should be handed over to the public

 Regarding the implementation of this decision of the Supreme Court, Rawat said that the commission will also study this decision and take measures to implement it appropriately

 US Vice President Joe Biden has said that the Taliban are not our enemies
 biden kii is tippanee ne republican party ko nayaa mudda de diya he, lekin white house ne biden kaa bachaav kiya he
 In an interview with Newsweek / Daily Best, Biden described how Pakistan was able to deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan
 unhone kaha ki yadi taliban ne alqaida kaa samarthan band kar diya hota, to america bhi aisa kar saktaa tha
 Returning to the reconciliation process, Biden said, "let us reach a place where Afghanistan can prevent itself from becoming a sheltered site for those who harm and target the US and its allies, so much so will be good
 lekin ham abhi vahaan nahin pahunch paae hai
 See, the Taliban are not our enemies in themselves
 biden ne kaha, yah mahatvapurn he
 The President has never made any such statement in our policy declarations, in which he has said that the Taliban are our enemies, because they are a threat to American interests
 biden ne kaha, vastav main yadi taliban maujuuda sarkaar ko giraane main sakasham ho jaataa he, jo ki hamen nuksaan pahunchane vaale bure logon ko rokane main hamaare saath sahyog kar rahi he, tab vah hamaare liye ek samasya ban jayega
 The White House defended Biden on Monday, saying that it was regrettable when spoken out of context
 white house ke pravaktaa je kaarne ne kaha, yah ek saamaanya baat he ki ham afghanistan main isliye gaye, kyonki america par 11 sitambar, 2001 ko hamalaa hua
 We are ultimately there to defeat Al Qaeda, bring stability to Afghanistan, so that Al Qaeda or other terrorists cannot regain their roots in that country
 kaarne ne kaha ki america ne afghanistan main isliye sena nahin bheji thi ki vahaan taliban kii satta thi, or uparashtrapati biden kaa kahana yah tha ki ham unase lard rahe hai, iskaa arth yah nahin ki unka khaatmaa karnaa he, taliban kaa khaatmaa yahaan mudda nahin he
 But Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said Biden's remarks and Biden and President Barack Obama's belief that the Taliban are not enemies are "shocking, factually inaccurate and a gross insult to our troops fighting in Afghanistan"

 aisa hi ek kamaal kaa avishkaar kiya he 15 saal kii ladki regaan jamalova ne
 Which has made a device that can produce electricity from rain drops
 aaie jaanate hai kaise hogi ye divaais
 Regan Jamalova is from Azerbaijan (a Muslim country in the middle of Eastern Europe and Asia)
 unki umr 15 saal he or 9veen kaksha kii chaatra he
 Failed in 12th, then started this business, now the idea of making a device like a millionaire, a student of 9th grade, Jamalova once asked her father, when the wind can produce electricity, then why can't it be made by rain? The father could not answer this question
 lekin jamalova ke man main is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane kii baicheni thi
 After which he thought why not find the answer to this question by himself
 yaheen se jamalova ko barish kii buundon se bijli banane kaa idia aayaa
 It was not easy to make a device that made electricity from the droplets of friend's help
 iske liye jamalova ne apni dost jahara kii madad lee
 After which both the girls started preparing for the device of making electricity
 aisa hi donon ladakiyon ne khud hi divaais taiyaar kar lee
 Both also took help of their physics teacher
 ye he divaais kaa nambarish kii buundon se bijli banane kii divaais kaa naam jamalova ne 'renergy' kaa naam diya he
 Let me tell you, this idea was so brilliant that the government of Azerbaijan gave 20 thousand dollars to both
 aapako bataa den, barish se bijli banane vaali yah divaais kii lambaai 9 meter hai
 The device has four parts - rainwater collector, electric generator, battery and water tank
 bachapan main doodh bechakar kiya tha guzaara, ab chalaate hai khud kaa bank!kaise kaam karti he ye divicerenergy naam kii divaais aasaani se kaam karti he
 First the tank has to be filled with water through the collector, which turns on the generator and then generates electricity
 jo bijli isse banati he use bydaree main store kar liya jaataa he
 After that electricity is used to light the lights in the houses
 aapako bataa den, renergy divaais abhi ek prototip he
 In which up to a liter of water can come
 lekin isamen itani bijli hoti he ki teen LED lite jal sakati he
 The specialty of this device is that it is eco-friendly due to which it does not spread any kind of pollution
 aapako bataa den, duniya main kai desh aise hai jahaan salbhar barish hoti he
 Such as: - Countries like Philippines, Malaysia and India have also approached the government of Azerbaijan to work on this prototype
 jamalova ne bataaya meri ye divaais un deshon kii madad karegi jahaan bijli kii kami zyada rahati he
 This can solve the power problem

 25 crores is a distant thing, 25 rupees, is it not even up to 5 rupees
 naa company sarkaar ko paise degi naa hi sarkaar company ko kuch de rahi he
 "what will change for the people? On this, the Minister of Culture says - no part of the building can be touched by the company and the maintenance of the Archaeological Department will be done as before

 Last year, the Maoists managed to loot about 31 weapons from them, but this year only one pistol was looted
 itnaa hi nahin, pichley saal jahaan 233 maovadiyon ne sarender kiya tha
 At the same time this year, 377 Naxalites have given up arms

 All this is happening due to new and thoughtful strategy
 koi bhi aisa din nahin hota he jab donon taraf se golabari naa ho, par ab halaat badal chuke hai
 Despite this, ieds in Naxalite areas are the biggest cause of concern for CRPF
 pichley saal jahaan 904 iidi hamale hue the, is saal sitambar tak hi 1303 hamale ho chuke hai
 In all the affected states except Chhattisgarh, CRPF is getting intelligence about Naxalites, which has now made it easier to take action against them

 Should be lots of fun @ starsportsindia # indvsl centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne chaar saal puure kar liye hai
 On this occasion, if the government is asked to calculate the work done by it, then the government is also trying to declare the achievements through its publicity system
 sarkaar kii safaltaaon-vifaltaaon par bahes ke bich ek baat daawey ke saath kahi ja sakati he ki pichley chaar saalon main desh ke bade-bade shikshan sansthaanon main jis tarah chaatr-chaatraon kaa andolan rashtriya raajnneeti main ird-gird ghumta najar aayaa vaisaa pichley kuch dashakon main kam hi dekhne ko mila he
 Seeing the kind of incidents that happened in different campuses, the question was whether the students are fighting for their rights or they have become the pawn of the ideological battle? There are many occasions in these four years of Modi government when the country's big- Students of large educational institutions appeared on the streets
 narebaaji hui
 The strike took place
 reliyaan nikaleen or kai baar to police se chaatr-chaatraon kii bhidnt bhi hui
 While this is common in student politics, this time things were slightly different because PM Modi, BJP and even the RSS itself were the targets of the agitating students during the Modi government
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ko ye kehane kaa mauka mila ki desh main haashie par aayaa vipaksh ab campus ke jariye sarkaar se chhadam yuddh lard rahaa he or chaatr iskaa mohara banaae ja rahe hai
 In this regard, former JNU student and translator Suyash Suprabh says, "what really happened was that the autonomy of the campuses was reduced in this government and there was a tremendous reduction in the rights of students
 aisa khullamakhulla hua or is vajah se chaatro kaa wo tabaka jo abtak arajanatik tha, raajnneeti se judaa or chaatro dwaara kiye ja rahe virodh pradarshnon kaa hissaa bana
 However, Saurav Sharma, former joint secretary of JNU Students Union and member of ABVP, does not agree with Suyash Suprabh's reply
 bakaul saurabh 2014 main modi sarkaar banane ke baad campason main hone vaali raajnneeti main jabardast giravat ai he or har ladaai main agendebaaji hui he
 aajtak
 in se baat karte hue saurabh kehete hai, 'bilkul aisa hua he
 Take what happened at the University of Hyderabad
 jeenyu main jo hua uski baat kar lijie
 Include BHU and AMU as well
 insabhi maamalon kaa raajnneetikaran hua he
 The students did not talk anywhere
 jo asal mudde the wo peeche chhot gaye or baat aresas yaa narendra modi kii hone lagi
 The most important thing in this whole trend is that it did not happen inadvertently
 ’agar tathyon par najar daalen or ghatnaon kii padtaal karen to donon tarah ke maamle milte hai
 While people associated with the government made objectionable statements about the students studying in the campuses, there were also attempts to target the Modi government on the pretext of the camps
 aapattijanak bayanon main sabase charchit rahaa tha bijepi vidhayakagyandev ahjaka JNU main condom vaala bayaan
 Ahuja said in a rally in Alwar on 22 February 2016, "4000 bottles of liquor, 10,000 cigarette filters, 4000 pieces of bidi, 50,000 pieces of bones, 2000 rappers of chips and 3000 used in JNU daily
 Got condoms made
 'jeenyu kii tarah sitambar 2017 main banaras main sthit kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay (biechayu) ubal padaa
 After the molestation of a student on campus, the anger of the students was so intense that the heat was felt till Delhi
 ghatana ke do-teen din baad biechayu se chaatro kaa ek dal dilli ke jantar-mantar par ikattha hua
 After a few slogans and bytes to the media, the speakers' speech began
 inamen ek naam congress ke tatkaaleen yuva netaa shahzad poonawala kaa bhi tha
 He held the Modi government at the center responsible for the entire affair from the beginning of his speech till the end and attacked the BJP, Narendra Modi and the RSS
 kul milakar agar puure maamle ko sampoornataa main dekhen to donon tarah ke maamle saamne aate hai
 Such efforts are also seen when the opposition parties tried to target the Modi government at the Center on the pretext of the campus, while there are also cases which show that the open government in the current government, the system of debating and the government question- The strength to respond was hurt
 campason se jude kuch bade maamle-hyderabad univarsity main ek chaatr rohit vemula ne aatmahatya kii lekin congress sahit sabhi vipakshi dal ise 'sansthagat hatya' kahkar modi sarkaar par hamalaa karte hai

 Students and opposition groups rallied against the government to end the minority status of Jamia Millia Islamia and not to give this status to Aligarh Muslim University

 Anyone can keep a person's books and there is nothing wrong with that

 ek nai study kii report main bataaya gaya he ki policystic overi syndrome (pisioes) se peedit mahilaon ke paidaa hone vaale bacchon main otism viksit hone kii adhik ashanka rahati he
 According to the study, PCOS is a disorder caused by high testosterone, which results in premature puberty, irregular menstruation and excess body hair
 yah study 'transleshnal cicriyatri' main prakashit hui he
 For this study, researchers examined data from about 8,588 women suffering from PCOS
 vahiin, pichhali study se pataa chalaa tha ki otistic bacchon main testosterone samet 'sex steroid' hormone ke str bad jate hai, jo bachche ke sharir or mastishk ko samay se pehle hi yuvavastha kii ore jane lagate hai
 Arguing the rising levels of hormones, researchers found that one of the reasons for this could be the birth mother's disorder
 nishkarsh bataate hai ki agar maa main saamaanya se adhik testosterone hota he, jaisaa ki pisioes vaali mahilaon ke maamle main dekha jaataa he, to kuch hormone garbhavastha ke dauraan placenta ko paar kar jate hai, jisase bhrun kaa is hormone se adhik sampark ho jaataa he or bachche ke mastishk kaa vikaas badal jaataa he
 Adrianna Cherskov from the University of Cambridge, UK, explains this finding further reinforces the theory that autism is not only caused by genes, but can also be caused by prenatal sex hormones such as testosterone

 )(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) gujarat main congress apni party ke keel kaante durust karne ke baad ab nae sire se gherebandi main jute gai he
 In the politics of Gujarat, three young people seem to be important to the party at this time, which they have started trying to help
 party ko lagata he ki, jahaan tak ho sake bijepi virodh ke vot ko wo ikattha kar sake
 First name- Hardik Patel: First of all, the big faces of the Congress hopeful Patidars are Hardik Patel
 hardik abhi 25 saal se kam umr ke hai or chunaav nahin lard sakate
 But they have the potential to influence large sections of the Patidar society
 isliye party ne andarkhaane hardik se baatcheet shuru kar di he
 According to party sources, initial talks with Hardik have been successful and if everything goes on like this, Hardik can appeal to vote in favor of Congress in the elections
 badale main congress patidaaron ko aarakshan par thos aashwaasan de sakati he, saath hi congress hardik ke kuch karibiyon ko tikat bhi de sakati he
 Another name - Jignesh, after this, another name is Jignesh coming from the Dalit society
 party lagaataar jignesh ke bhi sampark main hai
 According to sources, Jignesh has raised the flag of anti-bjp, but has also refused to contest on the Congress ticket
 aise main congress kii koshish he ki, jignesh jahaan se chunaav lade party unako samarthan de de or badale main jignesh bijepi virodh kii awaz buland rakhen
 According to sources, the Congress's talks with Jignesh on some seats are in a positive direction
 haalanki, party ko lagata he ki, jignesh kaa prabhaav kshetra hardik jaisaa bada nahin he
 Third name - Alpesh After this, the third name is Alpesh, who come from Thakor society
 party alpesh se bhi sampark kar rahi he
 Alpesh's area of influence is also limited, but the Congress wants to bring him into his court too, but he has not been able to succeed in Alpesh's case so far
 khulkar bana rahi ranneetidarasal, congress ko lagata he ki, shankar singh waghela ke jane ke baad ab wo khulkar apni ranneeti bana rahi he
 At the same time, the Gujarat Congress has told the high command that, NCP is now working like bjp's b team, they cheated in Rajya Sabha elections too
 aise main ensipi ke zarie bijepi sirf congress kaa nuksaan hi chaahegi
 Therefore, Congress should contest Gujarat elections without ncp's new strategy
 gujarat ke yuvaaon ko apni ore modana chaahati congressath hi gujarat main 18-35 saal ke yuvaaon ne congress kaa shashan nahin dekha, isliye in teen yuvaaon ke zariye congress gujarat ke yuvaaon ko apni ore modana chaahati he
 That is why the Congress is now busy trying to achieve this strategy
 aisa lagata he ki congress netaa manishankar ayyar apni party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke morche par hai
 On Thursday, he called PM Modi a 'lowly person'
 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prachaar charam par he
 But at the same time, a recent development of the state's income tax department is also a matter of discussion in the executive corridors
 ek saath padhie guuruuvaar shaam kii paanch badi khabaren
 1- Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement- Modi is a lowly person, PM said- i think of a low caste, it seems that Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar is on the front line of harming his party
