 Tamil Nadu Most voters in Tamil Nadu are unhappy about Chief Minister EK Palaniswamy's government
 survey main hissaa lene vaale 54 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne palanisvami sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko lekar asantosh jataayaa
 Only 18 per cent of the respondents in the Tamil Nadu survey appeared satisfied with the Palaniswami government
 vahintamilnadumein mukhya vipakshi party diemke ke pramukh emke stallin lokapriyata ke maamle main maujuuda mukhyamantri palanisvami se kahin aage hai
 41% of the participants voted to see Stalin as the next Chief Minister of the state
 vahiin palanisvami ko sirf 10 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne hi mukhyamantri ke taur par ek or kaarykaal dene ke paksh main raay jataai
 Two superstars of cinema in Tamil Nadu, Kamalhasan and Rajinikanth, have also recently entered politics

 In 2016, AIADMK formed the government under j Jayalalithaa winning 134 seats in the 232-member Tamil Nadu
 lekin usee varsh disambar main jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad AIADMK khemon main bant gai
 According to the PSE survey, 62 percent of the voters believe that factionalism-prone AIADMK will split again before the next assembly elections
 70 fisadi se zyada pratibhaagiyon kaa maananaa he ki jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad AIADMK sarkaar sahi dhang se kaam nahin kar rahi

 maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek or kaarykaal dene ke paksh main sirf 29 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne hi raay jataai
 Reactions: On the conclusion of the survey of Rahul Gandhi being ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of popularity in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, election analyst Yogendra Yadav says that the reason for this is that the BJP is not a big player in these states
 yadav kehete hai ki ‘modi kii lokapriyata sidhe kisi rajya main bijepi ke vot share se judi he
 States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh do not have a BJP player
 isliye yahaan modi kii lokapriyata kaa graph neeche he
 On Rajinikanth and Kamalhassan's knock on the Tamil Nadu political scene, Yadav says, "rajinikanth's appeal is huge
 lekin raajnneetik vichaardhaara kaa jahaan tak sawaal he to rajnikant ke paas kehane ko zyada kuch nahin hai
 Kamalhaas, on the other hand, is quite wandering, talking to the youth
 wo jayalalita ke jane ke baad khaali hue sthaan ke liye shashakt daavedaar prathit hote hai
 On the question of Karunanidhi's political heir after the demise of Karunanidhi in the DMK, Yadav says, "the space left vacant by Karunanidhi's departure has been filled to a great extent by Stalin
" karunanidhi ke nidhan ke baad bhi unki party kaa dhaancha vaisaa hi bana hua he
 His political successor (stalin) is clear
 vahiin AIADMK main sab charmara gaya he
 This party has to face explosion from inside

 BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao says that his party sees the South as an opportunity

 She was a 'vote-catcher' for her party

 Local governments in the southern belt are quite unpopular

 More than five and a half lakh people applied for these flats three months ago
 didie ke ye flats pitampura, dwarka, pashchim vihaar, dilashaad garden, vasant kujan, shalimaar baag, sarai khalil, rohinee, lokanayak puram aadi ilaakon main sthit hai
 The scheme is on 'free hold' basis

 India's dismal performance in nutrition remains in the spotlight for two days every year when the Global Hunger Index (GHI) report is released
 is saal bhi aisa hi hua
 Slipping under India in some light media made headlines and made headlines that proved worse than Pakistan! But their attention did not go to two important subjects
 ek, jiechai kii tulana shaayad hi kabhi salanaa aadhaar par kii jaati he or doosraa, jiechai sambandhi bhukh or poshan ke kul chaar sanketakon main khaadya or krishi sanghathan kii ore se shaamil 'calories khapat' paimaana bhi shaamil he, jo sahi nahin, kyonki isse khaadya aapurti ke sanketak calories seven kaa sanket dete hai
 This is why the government gets a chance to reject the hunger index results
 darasal, jiechai par dhyaan kendrit karne se poshan haashie par chalaa jaataa he, jahaan sudhaar kii gati bahut dhimi he
 unicef's Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey shows only minor changes in key indicators
 2016-18 ke dauraan kareeb ek-tihaai bhartiya bachche behad kamjor paae gaye, yahi anupaat kam vajan vaale bacchon kaa bhi tha
 UNICEF measures nutritional outcomes, these physical development indicators are more important than calorie consumption
 aakhir acchhee jidipi vikaas dar ke baavjood in sanketakon main sudhaar kii gati itani nidhi kyon he? vajah he nitigat upeksha
 Budgetary funds are low, then the government is not interested in understanding that the effect of inadequate nutrition lasts for generations and in the initial thousand days of the newborn (after the mother's conception to birth), she needs special care
 is
 is shrenee main aane vaali mata- shishu ko dhyaan main rakhkar kai sarkari yojanaayen banaai gai hai jaise maatrutiv laabh yojana or chah saal ke bacchon, garbhvatee tathaa dugdhpan karaane vaali maataaon ke liye samekit bal vikaas seva yojana
 The condition of both these schemes has been very poor in recent years
 anganwari bhojan suchi main andey ko shaamil karne ke peeche vichaar yah tha ki anda poshak tatwon se bharpoor ek 'super food' he or gramin ilaakon main jahaan cold storage kii suvidha nahin hoti, vahaan bhi ise uplabdh karana aasaan he
 Also, like milk and lentils, it cannot be diluted by adding water
 jharkhand kii anganwadiawon main vartmaan sarkaar ne andey bhejnaa shuru kiya, lekin pichley kuch maheenon se bina koi kaaran bataae andey kii aapurti roak di gai he or isaki koi guarantee nahin ki yah phir shuru bhi ho paaegi
 In other states, especially Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the upper caste vegetarian community has been strongly against the supply of eggs in anganwadis
 pichley ek dashak ke dauraan jab bhi bacchon, garbhvatee or dugdhpan karaane vaali mahilaon ko andey uplabdh karaane kaa prastaav aayaa, isi gut ke dabaav main aakar rajya sarkaar ne ise khaarij kar diya
 Recently, when the Minister of Women and Child Development expressed the intention of providing eggs to children and pregnant and lactating women in Madhya Pradesh in view of the worrisome situation of nutrition, a BJP leader even said that those who grow up by eating eggs Children will later become man-eaters
 raahat kii baat he ki maujuuda mukhyamantri kii soch aisi nahin he or unhone ghoshnaa kii he ki 1 april, 2020 se saptaah main teen baar andey bheje jaaenge
 Another topic is serious neglect - maternity benefit
 rashtriya khaadya suraksha adhinium ne 2013 main pehali baar sabko maatrutiv laabh uplabdh karana jaruri samajha
 Under this Act, women in the unorganized sector are given Rs 6,000 per child (eg organized sector women get 26 weeks' leave on conception and do not deduct money from their salary during that period
 ) is vaidhanik paatrata ko amal main laane ke liye varsh 2017 main jab pradhanmantri matra vandana yojana shuru kii gai to laabh ko manamaane tareeke se ghataakar 5,000 rupye kar diya gaya or vah bhi sirf pehle shishu ke liye or yah raashi bhi teen kishton main di jaati he
 a recent RTI showed that in 2018-19, the benefit of the scheme reached only 12 per cent of the sufferers
 shishu poshan ke naam par kiye ja rahe upayon se koi raahat nahin mili he
 Many states even today demand 'aadhaar' to register the names of children in Anganwadis, which is an open violation of the orders of the Supreme Court
 isse kitne hi jaruratmand bacchon ko tikaakaran or skool jane se pehle kii umr main milane vaali suvidhaon kaa phayda nahin miltaa
 In Assam, the state government created unnecessary hurdles in the popular mid-day meal program
 haal hi main centre sarkaar ne gramin ilaakon main bhi mil-de mile kii aapurti ke liye kendrikrut rasoi kii hi anumati di thi
 It is difficult for teachers and parents to keep an eye on centralized cooks (also cooks run by non-profit groups) and does not want to take any responsibility
 haalanki gramin ilaakon main kendrikrut rasoi kii koi jarurat nahin, kyonki isse laagat bhi badhegi or bhojan bhi kharaab ho saktaa he
 Nevertheless, the Government of Assam made arrangements to supply food to schools from the central kitchen of an NGO in the middle of the academic session
 phir vahi hua jiskaa dar tha
 Within a few days, more than 500 children had to be hospitalized due to poor health
 ham aksar yah sunate hai, ''bachche to saajhe hote hai
 Sadly, our policy makers do not understand this
 lekhika vikaas arthshaastri hai or ahmedabad iiem main padhaati hai*** Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the decision on the Telangana issue will be taken only after consensus is reached, so that it does not create unrest in other areas
 maldive ke chaar divasiy daure ke baad vishesh vimaan se swadesh lautate samay manmohan singh ne samvaadadataaon se kaha, 'telugana ek jatil masalaa he
 We want a consensus on this
 ham sabhi pakshon kii raay lenge, phir jo behatar samajha jayega vah karenge
 He said, 'we cannot resolve the Telangana issue by agreeing to Telangana
 vahaan ashaanti faili hui he or isse anya hisson main bhi gadabadi fail sakati he
 'manmohan Singh said,' We will look for a practical way for a proper solution and find a solution that all partners can accept
 'ullekhneey he ki andhra pradesh main alag telugana rajya ke liye pichley kai maheenon se vyapak andolan kiya ja rahaa he
 Controversy continues on this issue

 Subodh's family were constantly demanding to meet Yogi Adityanath
 mukhyamantri guuruuvaar subah inspector subodh kumaar ke parijanon se lakhanu se mulaakaat karenge
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya says that this incident is sad and unfortunate

 Regarding the incident of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister on the incident of Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that this incident is sad and unfortunate
 is prakaar kii ghatana jab se uttar pradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar ai he tabase aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he lekin bulandshahr kii ghatana nishchit taur se chintit karne vaali he

 After the investigation report comes, it would be appropriate to speak on this
 isamen mujhe lagata he ki sahi tareeke se jaanch honi chahie nishpakshta se jaanch honi chahie
 On the statement of Omprakash Rajbhar, Keshav Prasad Maurya says that Omprakash Rajbhar ji is a minister in our government, it is true

 The bomb's remote was pressed by none other than Lumbu Sharma's girlfriend, Nagina, and Nagina herself was killed in the blast
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki lambu sharma ne dhokhe se nagina ko maanav bam bana diya tha
 After this blast, Lambu Sharma had fled from the court premises
 darasal us din lambu sharma jail se peshi par adaalat aayaa tha or adaalat se bhaagane kii sari planning pehle se kar rakhi thi
 Lumbu Sharma had to make a full film on this trailer of Tarara Court of Lumbu, which was associated with Brijesh Singh
 ji haa, thik aara court kii tarah hi dhokhe main rakh kar taiyaar kiye maanav bam ke jariye lanbun sharma vidhayakamukhtaar ansaariko maarane kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha or sajeesh ke taar jude the sidhe brijesh singh se
 Like the Ara court, Mukhtar was planning an attack on Ansari
 maanav bam ke zarie mukhtaar ko maarane kii saazish rachi gai thi
 All this work was being done at the behest of Brijesh Singh
 is khooni sajeesh main mukhtaar ansaari kaa ek qareebi bhi shaamil tha
 The conspiracy to bomb Mukhtar was a conspiracy and Mukhtar Ansari was the target
 magar isse pehle ki sajeesh ko amali jama pahanaaya jaataa, lambu sharma 23 june 2015 ko dilli police ke hathe chadh gaya
 It was only after his arrest that it was revealed that a plan was made to kill Mukhtar Ansari in a bomb blast while taking him to court
 us vakt mukhtaar ansaari mathura jail main band tha
 After this revelation, Mukhtar was shifted from Mathura jail to Banda jail in view of security
 tabhi se wo yahaan band hai
 But there is no coincidence that Mukhtar and his wife have a heart attack after drinking tea in this way
 unke gharavaalon ne iske peeche koi gahari sajeesh hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The matter is being investigated
 philhal adhikari is bare main zyada kuch bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin hai

 But writing was short, singing the poems of others loudly in the street
 adhiktar ve paathya pustak main se hotin
 Moved to Delhi at the age of thirteen
 metric kii pariksha de kar dilli press main compozitory seekhney laga
 Gradually proof reader became
 is se pehle upanyaas aadi padhane kaa shauq tha
 Did not read serious literature
 shaam ke samay ucchtar shiksha kar rahaa tha
 Textbooks were imparting many kinds of knowledge
 lekin asli or vividh gyaan mil rahaa tha pruf padhane main
 Different topics
 hindi main english main
 Also boring stuff
 sarita, karevan main prakashit hone vaali vividh saamagree
 Poems, articles
 jaankaree bad rahi thi
 Used to buy books on a variety of subjects or brought to and from the library
 dekhadekhi likhane kii koshish karata
 i would also meet writers
 likhaai or aage badi
 When Sarita reached the editorial departments of Caravan, a completely new source of information was opened
 prakaashanarth aane vaali rachanaaen padhanaa
 Everyone would have some new knowledge
 achche or bure lekhan kii pahchaan badi
 My writing was also printed
 sabhi tarah ke vishyon par
 Started printing outside as well
 maadhuri yani times aaf india, mumbai pahunchaa to padhanaa-likhnaa simat gaya filmon tak
 That too till reading on good film art and writing on good films
 kaam karata rahaa
 Ten years passed by
 1973 ke ant tak aate-aate ek ub si hone lagi
 Where Sarita, write on Caravan's sociality, where it! i felt like leaving everything
 
 
 
 Then i remembered Roget's thesaurus
 thik bees saal pehle karevan main kaam karte dekha tha
 Then i thought that something like this in Hindi too
 tab main taees saal kaa tha
 i thought that someone would make a book like this in Hindi, definitely
 lekin hindi vaale jaanate hi nahin the ki thesaras kya hota he, kyon hona chahie
 So he was not made
 or 26 disambar 1973 kii raat jab main so nahin paa rahaa tha apni bechaini ke kaaran
 So someone, maybe I, said to me - you made it
 kar de hindi kii yah kami puri
 And the next morning on 27 December, i told Kusum (wife) that i want to give Hindi the first thesaurus, but may have to leave the job and go back to Delhi
 bina soche samajhe usne haa kar di
 This small word 'yes' is a very powerful word

 Birthday special: i will not talk about Ashok Vajpayee, whose poetry encountered difficulties in humanism and love, but for twenty years, reading remained closed except for Koskarma

 This is the answer to your question, why did you stop writing and spend your life in koshkarma
 thesaras aapaki pahchaan he
 How long did it take to compile, combine, edit? Arvind Kumar: At this time i will be able to give one or two reasons for delay in making this thesaurus
 yaad rahe ki ham 1973 se 1987 tak kii baat kar rahe hai
 The world was not aware of any bird named Internet
 kuch computer nae-nae banane shuru hue the
 When we started work in 1976, there was nothing like that
 thesaras banataa kaise he- is par tab english main bhi koi kitaab nahin thi
 All that was in front of us was Roset's thesaurus
 vahi meri prerana tha
 i thought that its sequence would be the same in Hindi
 par aisa ho hi nahin paaya
 Wheat was not grain and grass for that
 steel kaa sambandh lohe se nahin tha
 He was unique
 aisi tamaam baaten thim
 i thought, let's resort to our Sanskrit amarkosh
 vah or bhi asangat tha
 The workmanship was in the Shudra class
 hathi or mrityu kshatriya varg main the, kyonki hathi raajaaon kii sawari tha
 Kshatriyas used to die in war
 yahi nahin purohit bhi kshatriya varg main tha, kyonki vah raajaaon ke yahaan kaam karata tha
 Things like digging wells were in the Brahmin class, because they used to guess where water would be found in the earth
 or to or sangeet dev varg main tha, or gavaiye shudra the

 If you want to change the order, pick one tray and place it near another tray
 sab trey vaanchit kram se rakhane ke baad thesaras kaa sandarbh khand to ban saktaa tha, lekin index banane main kai saal lag jate
 Mistakes would also remain
 isliye mere bete sumit ne shabdon ko computerit karne kii salaah di

 We got an employee and got old cards computerized

 The work was completed in Bengaluru on August 1996

 We gave their printouts to National Book Trust India in September, on December 13, 1996, we presented the first set to the President

 If only the cards written on the tray could have become Hindi thesaurus, then the English vocabulary could not be inscribed on those cards
 hindi-english thesaras banane kaa idia sab se pehle meri beti mita ne diya
 His children were studying in the English medium
 unhen english shabdon ke arth samajhane kaa koi aasaan tareeqa nahin tha
 He said that english-hindi thesaurus would be of great use
 mere suzav par usne kuch maheene lagaakar samaantar kosh kii ek prati par har sheershak or upasheershak ke english mining likh die
 Now Sumit's job was databes main english pirone kii vidhi taiyaar karnaa
 Now i took over
 lagbhag das saal lage, hamaare paas donon bhashaaon ke shabdon kaa lagbhag gyaarah lakh abhivyaktiyon kaa khazaana ban gaya
 They could not all be contained in a book
 maine har koti or upakoti par chayan chihn ankit kiye
 The three volumes of what has been prepared now have a total of 28,23,630 words
 yah sansar kaa sab se bada dwibhashi thesaras he
 What is your opinion about the correctness of the language? Is Hindi heading in the right direction? Its future? Arvind Kumar: The purity of language is an illusion
 asambhav he
 English is considered a stable language
 uski puri vartanee sthir he
 Both his head lexicographer Johnson and Webster claimed that he had perfected the language
 yahi bhashaa ab hameshaa chalegi
 As soon as both thesaurus were printed, new words started coming in the language
 akasar videshi yaa navnirmit
 Hindi is not yet stabilized
 din raat badal rahi he
 New technologies are bringing new words
 saikadon kii taadaad main ham nae english, roosi, japani shabd aayaat kar rahe hai
 The process of importing words has been going on ever since Hindi was created
 jaise jaise hamaare antarsaanskrithik sambandh honge or bhi shabd aate rahenge
 No one can stop it, it should not be stopped, otherwise Hindi will soon fall behind Sanskrit language as historical language
 harbhajan singh dwaara srisanth kothppad maare jane kaa purana maamla(slapget) ek baar phir garmata ja rahaa he
 On one hand, Sreesanth has presented the incident in a different way, while two lords have rejected Sreesanth's new interpretation
 ‘slapget’ jaanch ke adhyaksh rahe nyaayamurti (sevanivrutt) sudhir nanaavati ne es srisanth ke us daawey ko khaarij kar diya, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki unhen 2008 ipel main harbhajan singh ne kohni maari thi
 Also, former IPL chairman Lalit Modi, who claimed to have the only copy of the 'slapgate' video, has said that the BCCI had decided not to make the footage of the incident public on the suggestion of its vice-president Arun Jaitley
 unhone kaha ki ve ise relies karne par vichaar karenge
 Lalit Modi wrote on his Twitter page, 'arun Jaitley's idea was not to make this video public at that time
 unhone jo kaha tha, hamane sweekaar kar liya
 But i will reconsider releasing it now
 ’lalit modi ne kaha, ‘haa, mere paas slapget video kii ekmaatr prati he
 Will consider whether or not i will release it in the next few weeks
 ’ modi ne es srisanth ke daawey ko khaarij kiya, jisamen unhone kaha ki harbhajan singh ne unhen thappad nahin, kohni maari thi
 Lalit Modi said, 'I was present in this match in Mohali
 maine yah ghatana dekhi thi
 The footage was also seen, so there is no question of ambiguity whether it was a slap or an elbow? ' He said, 'what Sudhir Nanavati has said is correct
 haa, bhajji ne dobaaraa use thappad maarane kii koshish kii thi, lekin use roak diya gaya tha
 On the other hand, Justice (retd) Sudhir Nanavati, who presided over the 'slapgate' investigation, also rejected s Sreesanth's claim that he had been elbowed by Harbhajan Singh in the 2008 IPL
 nanaavati ne kaha ki srisanth ko nishchit rup se tab bhartiya team ke saathi harbhajan ne thappad maaraa tha
 Nanavati, appointed by the BCCI to investigate this 'slapgate' incident, said that Sreesanth had not instigated him in any way and Harbhajan had tried to slap him for a second time, but was stopped by security personnel
 nanaavati ne kaha, ‘video footage main maine harbhajan ko daaen haath se srisanth ko uske chehre ke daaen hisse par thappad maarthe dekha tha
 It was perfectly clear, it could be seen clearly in the video footage
 ’nanaavati ne kaha, ‘usne (harbhajan ne) mere saamne sweekaar kiya tha, haa tamaacha maaraa gaya tha
 My first reaction was that i was shocked after watching the video footage at the BCCI office
 video main maine dekha tha ki harbhajan ne use ek thappad maaraa or vah dobaaraa use maarane ke liye aayaa, lekin do surakshakarmiyon ne use roak diya
 'why the hot issue again? Cricketer Sreesanth strongly criticized the comparison of gambhir-kohli's altercation with Bhajji Slapgate
 srisanth ne apane twitor acount par likhaa, ‘guuruuvaar raat tii-20 match ke dauraan gautam gambhir or viraat kohli ke bich hue takaraar kii khabar kii tulana bhajji slapget ke kii gai
 have had enough
 ab main chup nahin rahoonga
 He further wrote, 'bhajji never slapped me
 haalanki srisanth ne yah bhi likhaa, ‘match ke baad jab wo bhajji se haath milaane gaye to unhone (bhajji ne) pehle se unhen (srisanth ko) kohni se maarane kaa plan kiya hua tha
 But now i do not want Harbhajan to feel sad about that
 main duniya ko us baat ko bataanaa chahta hum ki us din kya hua tha
 i have no fault in that episode
 main media se aagrah karata hum ki wo us prakaran kaa video dekhe
 After Sreesanth's latest statement, Slapgate suddenly hit the headlines again
 baharhaal, srisanth kaa yah maamla philhal shant padataa najar nahin aa rahaa he

 Pankaja Munde, daughter of Union Minister of Maharashtra and late leader Gopinath Munde, has shown her strength in Saawargaon in Beed district
 pankaja munde ke paas is sabha kii ijaajat nahin thi, lekin unhen sunne ke liye vanjari samaaj ke log umad pade
 The meeting was held at the birthplace of Lord Baba in Beed district
 nagar jila prashasan ne bid or ahmednagar jile ke simavarti ilaake main sthit bhagawangadh par raily kii ijaajat nahin di thi
 Despite this, the Rural Development Minister of the state Pankaja Munde demonstrated his power at Dussehra in Santwar Baba's birthplace, Sanwargaon
 gopinath munde ne shuru kii thi ye prathabata den ki purv kendriya mantri gopinath munde (swargeey) ahmednagar jile main sthit bhagawangadh main har saal dashahara par utsav kiya karte the or vanjari samaaj ke jan samudaay ko sambodhit kiya karte the
 After the death of Gopinath Munde, Mahant Namdev Shastri of Bhagwangarh had announced that no politics rally would be held in Bhagwangarh
 pankaja munde ne is mudde par sawaal karne ke bajaaybhagwan baba ke janmasthanper raily kaa aayojan kiya
 Pankaja Munde and her sister MP Pritam Munde continued Dussehra at the birthplace of Lord Baba, who was worshiped in Marathwada region, while continuing the practice of his father in Bhagwangarh, right in Saawargaon
 daanv par thi donon bahanon kii raajnneetik haisiyatyah baat dhyaan rakhane kii he ki bhagawangadh main raily nahin hone se saanwargaanv kii raily main munde bahanon kii raajnneetik haisiyat daanv par thi
 After the 2014 assembly elections, Gopinath Munde was believed to be returning from state politics to state politics and it was almost certain that Gopinath Munde would take over as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 achaanak dilli main car durghatana main unki mrityu ke baad kayaas lag rahe the ki unki beti pankaja munde ko mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari di jaaegi or ve maharashtra kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri hongi
 but that did not happen
 ek saal baad tak pankaja munde kii mukhyamantri banane kii ichha or daavedaari kii baaten raajnneetik galiyaaron main hoti raheen, ye baaten tab tak hoti raheen jab tak pankaja munde par chikki ghotaale ke aarope nahin lage
 The rally was not allowed on Bhagwangarh on the occasion of Dussehra in 2016, but a grand rally was organized on the plateau near the citadel and a large number of Vanjari community rallied
 vanjari samaaj bhagwaan baba ke prati aasthaa rakhata he or usne gopinath munde kii betiyon ko puraa sammaan diya
 'pankaja to become CM of Maharashtra in future' This year it was also said that there will be a rally near Bhagwan Garh
 pichley maheene nagpur ke paas kaatol vidhansabha nirvachan kshetra se bijepi vidhayak ashish deshmukh ne kaha ki pankaja munde aane vaale samay main maharashtra kii mukhyamantri bane, to pankaja munde ne bhi jawaab main kaha ki ashish deshmukh kii ichha puri ho
 This year, the Munde sisters had to organize a Dussehra rally in Sanwargaon if the rally was not allowed on the plateau below Bhagwangarh
 pichley saal bhagawangadh kii raily main maharashtra sarkaar ke anek netaa maujuud rahe
 This year, apart from Pankaja Munde and MP Pritam Munde, only the State Home Minister Ram Shinde attended the rally in Sanwargaon, but did not give a speech
 donon bahanon ko sunne badi sankhya main log umade
 From this it became clear that the Vanjari society, which believes Gopinath Munde, also honors the Munde sisters
 sant bhagwaan baba kii bajaay jhande par najar ai gopinath munde kii tasvirsaanwargaanv ghat main pradesh kii gramin vikaas mantri pankaja munde ne dashahra utsav kaa dhvaj fahraaya
 But in the middle of this flag was not the picture of Saint Bhagwan Baba, but the face of former Union Minister Gopinath Munde
 pankaja munde ne apane vaktavy main kaha ki vah apni raajnneetik takat ko badhaane kaa iraadaa nahin rakhti
 But, the picture of Gopinath Munde inscribed in the flag raised many questions whether it was a new tactic to increase political power in the guise of faith towards Sant Bhagwan Baba

 The environment ministry today strongly recommended the demolition of the 31-storey building of the controversial Adarsh residential Society located in the Colaba area of mumbai as unauthorized and said that ignoring the law cannot be an excuse for not following it
 paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ke dastakhat vaale is aadesh main kaha gaya, ‘puure dhaanche ko hataa diya jaye kyonki yah anaadhikrut he or iske nirmaan ke liye tateey niyaman kshetra (siarjed) adhisuchana 1999 ke tahat koi manjuuri hasil nahin kii gayi he
 The ministry strictly stated in its order that the 'unauthorized structure' be dropped and that the area be brought back to its original position within three months
 kolaba sthit is imaarat ke liye mul rup se chah manjilon kaa nirmaan hona tha or isamen kargil yuddh ke shaheedon ke parijanon ko awaas diye jane the
 The Ministry of Environment said in its report that 31 floors were built without taking necessary approvals
 paryaavaran mantralay ne adarsh sosayadi ko uski 31 manjila imaarat ke nirmaan ke bare main pichley varsh 12 november ko ek kaaran bataao notice jari karte hue kaha tha ki kyon na uski avaidh manjilon ko gira diya jaye
 However, Ramesh said in a two-pronged final order of the environment ministry that apart from demolishing the building, two other options were also considered
 ek vikalp yah tha ki agar upyukt praadhikaar se jaruri manjuuri lee gayi hoti to imaarat kii atirikt manjilon ko hataane ko kaha ja saktaa tha
 Ramesh said the option to demolish some floors was rejected because suggesting doing so would have been like regularizing or waiving the very serious violation of the CRZ notification 1991
 paryaavaran mantralay kii report kahati he ki is ek or vikalp par bhi vichaar kiya gaya ki sarkaar ko is imaarat kaa niyantran lene kii sifarish kii jaye taaki baad main imaarat kaa kisi saarvajanik uddeshy ke liye istemaal karne ke bare main vichaar kiya ja sake
 Ramesh said that this option was also considered but it was also rejected because even though the final use would have been in public interest, it would have led to regularization of the CRZ Notification 1999 violation
 unhone kaha, ‘‘is maamle main (imaarat ko gira dene kii sifarish ke itar) koi anya faisla karnaa ucchtam nyaayalay or vibhinn ucch nyaayalayon dwaara unke nirnyon main sthapit kiye gayi kade purv udaahranon ke mukaable narmi baratane jaisaa hota
 "the Adarsh residential Society has violated the spirit of the CRZ Notification 1999," the ministry report says
 sosayadi ne is adhisuchana ke tahat manjilon ke nirmaan ke liye manjuuri lene kii jarurat ko bhi nahin pahachaanaa
 Whether or not the Society was aware of such a need, it does not matter because neglect of the law cannot be an excuse for not complying with it
 ’ mantralay ne adarsh sosayadi ko diye apane nirdesh main saaf taur par kaha ki 31 manjila imaarat ko gira diya jaye or us kshetra ko teen maheene ke bheetar uski mul sthiti main laa diya jaye
 The ministry said that in the event of the building not being demolished, it will be forced to take steps to enforce its directives legally
 ramesh ne is report ke jariye yah bhi spasht kiya ki saat janvari se amal main aayi nayi siarjed adhisuchana 2011 se adarsh awasaiya sosayadi jaise maamalon par koi asar nahin padegaa or aise maamalon se purv kii adhisuchana ke anuroop hi nipta jaayegaa
 In a meeting of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority held on 11 November, there was a consideration of the alleged violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification by the Adarsh residential Society
 is baithak ke agle hi din 12 november ko mantralay ne sosayadi ko kaaran bataao notice jari kar diya
 After this, the Society was given time to file the reply and it was further extended for one time

 ' Pappu was elected to the Lok Sabha thrice from Purnia and twice from Madhepura and is said to have considerable influence in the kosi-seemanchal region
 pappu rajya kaa tufaani daura kar rahe hai or khud ko yuvaaon kaa khaskar yadavon ke bich kaa netaa prastut karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In the case of election meetings, he is overshadowing his political mentor Lalu
 apane 15 saal ke raajnneetik kariyar main vah teji se party badalte rahe hai
 He went from LJP to SP and then RJD and now he is leading the new party
 gauratlab he ki pappu yadav ne pichley saal bihar main doctoron se ‘apil’ kii thi ki ve garib rogiyon ke upachaar ke liye apni fees kam kar den
 He also threatened that he would stage a sit-in against doctors if he did not do so
 pappu ne kaha ‘main kingmekar kii bhoomika main ho bhi saktaa hum or nahin bhi lekin maine kaha he ki tisare morche ke samarthan ke bina koi sarkaar nahin ban paaegi
 'pappu claims' youth of Bihar have rejected both NDA and UPA
 yuva unke saath nahin ja rahe
 They have seen Nitish and Lalu for 25 years

 That's why youngsters now want to know who will change their lives
 ’ According to Pappu, 'I will do this without spreading the poison of caste politics

 When asked whether the Bihar election was a 'contest between the forward and backward castes, he said thrice' the question does not arise

 ’ In Chhattisgarh, only 56 km of Sukma, not only Dornapal road is the road of death, but most of the roads of Bastar have become the road of death
 ye zyaadaatar sadaken kachi hai, naksali jab chahen tab un par IED, pressure bam or barudi surangen bichaate hai
 The rough road works for the Naxalites to attack the police and central security forces
 lihaaja naksali nahin chaahate kii in sadakon ko pakki karne ke liye koi prayaas ho
 For this, Naxalites sometimes burn vehicles, machines and materials engaged in road construction and sometimes leave no stone unturned to kill government officials
 darjanon baar bastar main sadakon ke navnirmaan ke liye PWD vibhaag ne tender nikaala
 But neither the contractor came forward to build a road nor the institutions
 aakhirkar CRPF or sthaneey police kii dekh-rekh main police houseing sosayadi ne sadakon ke nirmaan kaa bidaa uthaaya
 This move made the Naxalites so angry that they intensified their attacks on the security forces
 bastar main daakhil hote hi kai kachi or pakki sadako main yaa phir nirmaanadhin sadakon main trek, hiva, tractor, JCB mashiinon ke alaava nirmaan kaary main lagane vaali construction mashiinon ko naksali aag ke hawaale kar dete hai
 Many scenes of burning of vehicles and machines can be seen on the streets here
 naksali kisi bhi surat main nahin chaahate kii sadakon kaa nirmaan ho
 For this, they pressurize the common villagers and the security forces
 sukama ke alaava dantewada, narayanpur, bijapur or abhujhamad wo ilaaka he jahaan naksaliyon kii samanantar sarkaar chalati he
 In these areas, the state and central government wants to build roads with the Joint Development Fund, that too is confirmed
 in ilaakon kii kai kachi sadakon ko pakki karne kii kaarywahi kii ja rahi he
 While there are two dozen forested routes, where there is no way of movement
 aise pakadendinuma margon ko bhi pakki sadakon main tabdeel karne ke liye chinhit kiya gaya he
 These roads have been under Naxalite occupation for almost 25 years
 inamen se zyaadaatar sadakon ke nirmaan ke liechhattisgarhke PWD vibhaag ne 18 se zyada baar tender nikaale
 However, neither any contractor nor any company had the courage to build the road
 sukama main hue naksali hamale ke ek din pehle hi gariyaaband ke mainpur main suraksha balon ne baribharakam barudi surang ko diphyus kiya
 crpf's caravan was about to pass on this route
 lekin, uske pehle hi sadak main bichhi barudi surang khoj lee gai
 In Bijapur, Narayanpur and Dantewada, more than eight landmines have been defused in the last three days
 chhattisgarh main kendriya suraksha balon ke jawan hon yaa phir police ke unke liye sadakon par bichhi barudi surangen ek badi chunauti ban gai he
 Be it face-to-face fighting with the Naxalites, or searching within the forest, landmines are bringing death to them
 bastar main naksaliyon ne sadakon ke chappe-chappe par land mine bicha rakhi he
 There is hardly any terrain in the forest where there are bombed tunnels or pressure bombs
 inaki chapet main aane se suraksha balon ko jaan-maal kaa jabardast nuksaan hota he
 Be it the soldiers of the police and central security forces or the common residents of Bastar, they are often falling prey to the landmines lying in the streets
 gariyaaband jile se lekar kanker, jagadalpur, sukama, bijapur, konta, kondagaanv or antahagarh tak sadak maarg jaanaleva sabit hota he
 Land mines are lying in many parts of these roads

 em avasthi ke mutabik ye bahut zyada jokhim bharaa ilaaka he IED ke liye kyonki pichley chaar-paanch maheene main jo bhi hamaare security forces ne kiya he or sarkaar ke vikaas kaam bhi chal rahaa he, sadaken ban rahi hai isliye naksaliyon ne bahut zyada IED lagaae hai
 They say that many people have died from this
 unke mutabik police ke saamne badi chunauti he ye IED hi he
 Whether it is common villagers in Bastar or the police and central security forces personnel, walking on the streets is risky
 in sadakon par paidal chalanaa tak dubhar ho gaya he
 Any step placed on the ground can prove fatal
 bullate pruf vaahan ho yaa anti land mine vical, yaa phir aam motor gaadiyaan kisi kii bhi raah sadakon par aasaan nahin he
 These days, the work of finding hidden landmines around the roads and land in Bastar is going on vigorously

 AIMIM President and MP from Hyderabad, Asaduddin Owaisi raised controversy by raising questions over the award of Bharat Ratna to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 ovaisi ne bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv up pradhanmantri laalkrishna adwani ko padam vibhushan die jane par bhi virodh jataayaa
 Condemning the Narendra Modi government's decision to give these top civilian awards to Vajpayee and Advani, the BJP on Monday said that MIM mps are trying to communalise the issue
 ovaisi ne ravivaar raat yahaan ek pustak vimochan samaaroh main kaha ki adwani ko desh kaa doosraa sarvocch naagarik sammaan padam vibhushan kaise diya ja saktaa he, jo aapraadhik maamalon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 The MIM MP was referring to the case related to the Babri Masjid demolition case against Advani
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'vahi adwani jinhone apni rathyatra se desh main vinaash failaayaa
 This will probably be the first case of Padma Vibhushan being given to someone who is facing criminal cases
 'emm saansad ne aarope lagaaya ki vaajapeyi ne ayodhya mudde par paanch disambar, 1992 ko ek bhaashan main kuch vivaadaaspad tippaniyan kii thim, jiske video utyub par uplabdh hai
 Senior BJP leader and Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in a sultry tone that it seems that some people want Osama bin Laden to be given a bigger award
 unhone kaha, 'isliye ye log desh ke liye yogadan dene vaale or balidaan dene waalon ko sammanit karne par sawaal uthaaenge, kyonki is tarah kaa sammaan diya janaa unhen pasand nahin aata
 He likes people living against the country
 'input: IANS Last year was the month when BJP used to take the name of Dr
 Harsh Vardhan in every other thing
 unki eemaandaaree, pulse polio main unka yogadan vagairah unki har khubi ne bijepi ko jaise sanjivani de di thi
 Before that, the post of Vijay Goel as BJP President was posted all around
 yah sandesh ja rahaa tha ki vijay goyal hi mukhyamantri ke daavedaar yaa ummidavaar hai
 When the Aam Aadmi Party started targeting Vijay Goel, the BJP had announced the name of Dr
 Harshvardhan
 haftebhar ke bheetar bijepi ke saare poster badal die gaye
 Instead of Vijay Goel, Dr
 Harshvardhan's face was smiling
 bijepi ko arvind kejariwal ke eemaandaar brands ke saamne doctor harshavardhan kaa eemaandaar brands mil gaya tha
 The month of November is one year later, but the doctor is not taking any name of Harshvardhan
 buudhvaar ko pandit pant maarg par bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay se baar baar poocha ki samuhik netritv kaa kya matlab he jab aapke paas ek se ek netaa hai
 He kept saying repeatedly that the decision has been taken and the leader will be elected only after the election
 ham narendra modi ke naam par chunaav ladenge
 i kept asking about Dr
 Harshvardhan
 poocha to jagadish mukhi or vijay goyal ke bare main bhi lekin ek baar bhi satish upaadhyaay ne nahin kaha ki hamaare paas netaaon kii koi kami nahin he
 Dr
 Harsh Vardhan is also a qualified candidate
 satish upaadhyaay ne yah bhi daawey se nahin kaha ki koi bahari bijepi kii jeet kaa mazaa nahin legaa
 My point was towards Kiran Bedi
 pradesh adhyaksh kii haisiyat se ve sire se khaarij kar hi sakate the magar wo yahi kahkar taalte rahe ki jo hua nahin he uskaa jawaab kaise den
 But didn't Dr
 Harsh Vardhan be useful to the BJP? kya unki dilli kii raajnneeti main ab vaapasi nahin hogi
 There are questions but i do not have the answers
 doctor harshavardhan ko jab kendriya swasthya mantri banaaya gaya tha tab aisi charchaa saamne ai thi ki ve khush nahin hai
 He would like to return to Delhi politics
 jab dilli main sarkaar banane ko lekar kai tarah ke sawaal ho rahe the to doctor harshavardhan ne ascharyajanak rup se chuppi saadh lee
 The media asked but did not respond
 aisa laga ki yaa to unhen chup rahane ke liye kah diya he yaa doctor harshavardhan ne samaj liya he ki ab ve netritv kii pasand nahin rahe
 An inference can also be made that the BJP will now contest elections only in the name of Modi
 haryana or maharashtra kii baat samaj main aati he jahaan unke paas koi aisa netaa nahin tha jo puure rajyabar main aadhaar rakhata he, lekin doctor harshavardhan ke saath to ye baat nahin he
 BJP did not get majority but BJP got 32 seats due to Dr
 Harsh Vardhan
 ho saktaa he ki bijepi ise haar ke rup main dekh rahi he isliye doctor harshavardhan par daanv nahin lagaana chaahati lekin tab phir bijepi maharashtra kii jeet ko kaise jeet kahegi
 It is possible that the name of Dr
 Harsh Vardhan may come later as the electoral phase has just begun, but Satish Upadhyay reiterated his line that there will be elections under collective leadership and the Chief Minister will be decided after the election
 ab bijepi main modi kii pasand kaa ek nayaa naam ho gaya he
 Collective leadership
 bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay kya kisi kii line par chal rahe hai
 After all, why did he not accept the presence or utility of Dr
 Harsh Vardhan, or reiterate the way the BJP was chanting his name exactly one year ago
 kya bijepi ne tay kar liya he ki narendra modi jis par haath rakh denge vahi mukhyamantri hoga yaa aar es es jise kahegaa vahi ab mukhyamantri hoga
 After Haryana, Maharashtra, there is talk of the choice of RSS in the selection of Chief Minister in Goa, it seems that the Union wants to keep the leadership of the states under its control
 prachaarak hi mukhyamantri honge
 There is no concrete evidence of such analyzes, but by looking at the trend of the wind, such an idea is available
 dilli kaa chunaav dilachasp hone ja rahaa he
 Dr
 Saheb, with his niche, will be seen restlessly walking in the same health ministry in New Delhi and will miss that voice when the entire BJP and Modi used to name him in every meeting
 doctor doctor
 Will Dr
 Harsh Vardhan break his silence about what he thinks about his role in Delhi
 kya wo pehle kii tarah aashwast hai
 Do they want to lead the Delhi BJP? in sab sawaalon ke liye doctor ko haazir hona hoga

 In the program of Swachh Bharat Mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that three years ago i was in America, came late on 1 October night and started sweeping on 2 October
 us samay meri kaaphi aalochana kii thi, 2 oktober chuttee kaa din hota he lekin chuttee kharaab kii thi
 My nature is that i keep facing everything quietly, gradually increasing my capacity
 sabhi ke saath aane se banegaa svachh indiapem ne kaha ki mahatma ji ne jo kaha vah galat nahin ho saktaa he, isliye is raste ko chunaa
 Every Indian loves cleanliness
 piem ne kaha ki ek hajaar mahatma gandhi, 1 lakh modi bhi milakar svachh bharat kaa sapana puraa nahin kar sakate hai, jab tak janata saath nahin judegi tab tak yah puraa hoga
 PM said that after five years, the news of the mess will be made
 ab ye mishan kisi sarkaar kaa nahin he balki puure desh kaa he
 We got Swarajya, cleanliness is the mantra of the best India
 shaharon main svachh rahane kii hodeswatchta kii ranking ke kaaran rajanetaaon par dabaav paidaa ho rahaa he, iske kaaran shaharon main svachh rahane kii res lag rahi he
 When you build a toilet, it is not used, these reports are not bad
 lekin isse sabhi ko siikhnaa chahie
 Before entering the toilet, goat-tied goats also worked for cleanliness while staying in the organization, collecting money and adopting a village in Gujarat
 or usamen swatchta kii vyavastha karwaai
 We had toilets built all over the village, but later when i went, i saw goats tied there
 aavashyaktaa ke anusaar skool or teacher hai lekin phir bhi shiksha kii sthiti peeche he
 Children get illness only by not washing their hands
 piem ne kaha ki modi ko gaali dene ke liye hajaar vishay hai main aapako roj kuch naa kuch detaa hum iske liye
 Men stand anywhere but women do not defecate in the open
 PM said that the country's media has taken forward Clean India
 agar koi baahar se desh main aayega to vah tajmahal dekhegaa, lekin uske aas-paas gandagi dikhegi
 It is necessary to look at the mission of cleanliness from the perspective of women
 purush log to kahin bhi chauraahaa mil jaae to khadey ho jate hai, lekin mahilaayein kabhi bhi khule main shouch nahin karti he
 We do not understand cleanliness properly
 kaam maangane ko biodata dete hai logajab se main piem bana hum log mujhase milte hai or dhire se mujhe apana biodata pakadaa detaa hai or bolte hai ki kuch seva ho to yaad kijiega
 i tell them to do something for the sake of cleanliness, after that it is not visible
 ek parivaar main swatchta kii jaagarukta naa hone se salanaa 50 hajaar rupye tak kaa kharch bad jaataa he
 All politicians quarrel with the statue of great men, but no one cleanses
 har koi kahata he ki main unako maanata hum to unki murti lagani chahie, lekin baad main kabutar murti par kya karte hai sab jaanate hai

 According to Congress sources, there has been a discussion between the state and central leaders of the party on the issue of alliance with AAP for the last two days in the party

 After this, on Saturday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi held a meeting with other leaders including Chacko and Dixit only to explore the possibilities of an alliance in Delhi

 Cricketer-turned-commentator Navjot Singh Sidhu on Wednesday slammed former Australian captain Steve Waugh, who criticized Mahendra Singh Dhoni for making the turning wicket, while advising the Indian team to field three spinners in the Mumbai Test
 siddhu ne kaha ki jab bharat ko england yaa australia main anukool pichen nahin milti to phir elistare cook kii aguwai vaali team ke liye bhi red carpet bichaane kii jarurat nahin he
 He said, 'ask Steve Waugh if he gives us the turning track in Perth
 jab hamaari team vahaan jaati he to hamaari team bhi shuru main un pichon par nahin khel paati he
 What Steve Waugh wants us to reward him (england) by putting this series on the plate
 dhoni pich keval apane liye nahin bana rahe hai
 This is for both teams
 ’siddhu ne kaha ki bharat ko chaar test maichon kii siries main clin sweep karne ke liye har haal main terning wicket banani chahie kyonki yah england kii kamajori he
 He said, 'this series is not for laying the red carpet
 ye siries jeetne ke liye he
 The British people have come, give them good pitches
 All these things are nonsense
 ham log jab vahaan jate hai kya ve terning wicket banaate hai
 Winning this series is very important for Indian cricket
 yah siries virdohi team kii hausalafajai ke liye nahin he
 ' notebandi ke dauraan abhi tak jandhan ke khaaton main hi blike mani ke khapaye jane kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 That too in farmers' accounts, especially through rural banks
 notabandi ke dauraan RBI ne gramin bainko main puraane noton kii jamaa nikasi par roak bhi lagaai thi
 However, this ban was lifted in a few weeks
 iske baad gramin bank, kaali kamai ko thikaane lagane ke kaarkaane ban gaye
 Something similar has happened in Chhattisgarh
 yahaan jandhan ke khaaton main arabon rupaye jamaa hone kii jaanch abhi chal hi rahi thi ki ek or nayaa khulaasa hua he
 a large amount of black money was also deposited in rural banks under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and was withdrawn in time
 wo bhi kisaanon ke khaaton se
 At present, the investigation of this case has also started and in the first investigation, the manager of Grameen Bank of Bemetara district and a cashier have been killed by the police
 bemetara police thane main police karmiyon ke saamne ghutane teke ye koi peshewar apradhi nahin hai
 Rather, the manager of Grameen Bank in the area and his Hamaraj is the cashier
 haalanki ye peshewar apradhi nahin hai, lekin jo aparaadh inhone kiya he wo badi hi chaalaaki or peshewar tareeke se anjaam diya gaya he
 During the note ban, the manager and his staff assured the farmers that they should open the accounts of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana
 unke khaaton main bataur lone 50 hajaar tak kii rakam bagaiyr kisi dastavejon ke jamaa kiye aa jaaegi
 The farmers opened their accounts by relying on the bank manager
 aaropee manager ne haathon-haath kisaanon se rakam jamaa karne vaali parchi or nikasi kii parchi donon main hastakshar bhi karvaa liye
 After this, farmers did not even take care of their accounts of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana for a month
 is ummid main kii ek naa ek din unka lone sweekrut ho jayega
 But a week ago, when these farmers reached the bank to get the information about the loan amount, it was found that lakhs of money were deposited in their accounts and also went out
 philhal apni passbook apadet karaane ke baad ye kisaan haath mel rahe hai
 His condition is like neither maya nor na ram

 According to Dipanshu Kabra, this scandal has been carried out very cleverly
 shuruaati padtaal main kareeb 19 lakh rupye kaa pataa chalaa he
 If we investigate the bank more properly, we will get a bigger scam
 unke mutabik audit report main paaya gaya ki khatedaaron ke acount main purana note jamaa kiya or vidrol kiye gaye
 Whose are these notes, we are inquiring
 police ko andeshaa he ki ekbade ghotaaleko gramin bainkon ne anjaam diya he
 In the initial investigation itself, dozens of such accounts of Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana have come to the fore in which lakhs of deposits have also been deposited and withdrawn
 police kii maane to akele bemetara main paanch hajaar se zyadapradhanmantri mudra yojanake khate khole gaye wo bhi notebandi ke dauraan
 While the accused manager and cashier told the police that they are not the only culprits but black money has been consumed in most areas of the state
 poochhataanch ke dauraan bank manager ne is bare main munh nahin kholaa he ki aakhir yah rakam kiski he, kaise un tak pahunchi or nikasi ke baad aakhir kin haathon ko soup di gai
 Currently, the farmers are demanding a CBI inquiry into the matter
 notebandike dauraan is rajya main is baat kaa khulaasa hua tha ki yahaan ke gramin bainko main netaaon ke arabon rupye kisaanon ke khaaton main jamaa kara die gaye
 In particular, the RBI and Income Tax Department of the loanee farmers were still investigating the transactions of rural banks that the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana also came under scrutiny

 The Aam Aadmi Party called it a courtesy call

 haalanki aap kaa kahana he ki naidu ne kejariwal se shishtachar bhent kii
 TDP president Naidu, who was involved in uniting regional parties to form a non-bjp alliance, had also met CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury earlier in the day

 While doing politics on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, the BJP did a big program at the Talkatora Stadium, but only the garbage was seen everywhere instead of curd chuda from the latent and filth spread in the program
 dilli bijepi ne makar sankranti ke maukey par purvanchal morcha kaa ek program kiya
 During this time people were called from all corners of Delhi and BJP Delhi President Manoj Tiwari showed his strength
 dilli bijepi ke sankranti program main dahi chuda khaane hajaaron kii sankhya main dilliwasi aae , beshak bheed ke aane se manoj tiwari kii siyaasi takat main ijapha hua lekin khaane ke program ke baad faili gandagi se pradhanmantri modi kesvachh bharat mishanko dhakka lagata dikhaa
 The 70-year-old, who had come from Harinagar in Delhi with someone, said that there was so much crowd in the program that his leg got hurt in the push and nothing could not be eaten
 jab is afratfari parabijepidilli prabharee shyaam jaju se poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki ye kaaryakartaaon kaa bijepi ke prati pyaar he

 When the policemen stationed there prevented the protesters from doing so, both of them clashed
 pradarshkariyon ne is dauraan police par patharav bhi kiya, jiske jawaab main police ne bhi lathicharge kiya
 Four people were injured in this violent clash
 pradarshnakariyon ne chehre par nakaab daal rakhaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that earlier on the first date of the month of January also, protesters waved flags of Pakistan and ISIS in Jamia mosque and keelaks around it
 tab bharat virdohi naare lagaae the or aatanki sargana hafiz said ke postaron ko bhi laharaaya gaya tha
 a large number of teenagers and children were also involved in the protests in the presence of the army
 aktubar kii 14 taarikh ko rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne kaha ki rajya main congress kai dhadon main banty hui he jisamen tamaam netaaon ne khud ko mukhyamantri ghoshit kar daalaa he or vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hi apane mantrimandal tak bana daale hai
 He had made his party's strategy clear by stating that the BJP is going to raise a loud noise that the opposition party has two chief ministerial candidates — former Union Minister Sachin Pilot who has been the chairman of the Pradesh Congress Committee since January 2014
 And second, senior leader Ashok Gehlot, who has been chief minister twice
 ye donon hi obisi shrenee se aate hai
 Earlier, BJP President Amit Shah also tried to draw attention to the same issue of how the Congress had to bring Rahul Gandhi as a face to challenge Chief Minister Raje in the state, as he was a candidate of his Chief Ministerial candidate
 She was unable to take any decision in Barre
 party kii ranneeti ke centre main payalat va gahalot, donon ke khilaaf maahaul khadaa karnaa he
 Caste is playing a big role in this
 raaje mukhyamantri ke taur par gahalot ke kaarykaal kii "naakaamiyon'' par nirantar prahaar kar rahi hai (gahalot kii mali jati kaa raajnneetik prabhaav takreeban naganya-sa he or rajya kii 200 main se keval teen siton par uskaa asar he)
 On the other hand, they are also trying hard to turn Meena votes against Pilot
 payalat khud gurjar hai jinka asar kareeb aadha darjan vidhansabha kshetron main he
 But the Gurjars have had traditional enmity with the Meenas
 meenaon ke paas anusuchit janajati kaa darja he or ve kareeb do darjan vidhansabha siton par mukaable kaa rukh palat sakate hai
 Senior leader Kirori Lal Meena, who returned to the BJP after a decade, is also now demanding that the pilots clarify their stand on the demand for Scheduled Tribe status to the Gurjars
 is par meenaon kaa gurjaron se hameshaa virodh rahaa he
 On this issue too, efforts are being made to pit the pilots and supporters of Gehlot against each other
 vidhansabha chunaav raaje ke raajnneetik bhavishya ke liye bahut mahatvapurn hai
 She is the only one among contemporary BJP veterans who has failed to win consecutive elections
 haarane se party main unki sthiti kamjor ho jaaegi kyonki pradhanmantri narendra modi or shah se unke rishte pehle hi talkh chal rahe hai
 The BJP may be trying to fuel the gehlot-pilot rivalry within the Congress, but it has a similar situation and it is difficult to take Raje's opponents along
 sarkaar-virdohi maahaul bhi garam he or isi vajah se raaje ne suraj gaurav yatra nikaalane kaa faisla kiya tha taaki ek to log apana gussa nikaal len or saath main ve apni party va sarkaar ke kiye "achche kaamon'' ko gina saken
 Apart from this, Raje also started public audit work in which he listed three dozen initiatives in every assembly constituency and then challenged local mlas, collectors and people to tell them whether these works were of poor quality
 yatra main ve apane pichley form main lautati bhi dikhaai deen, jab ve har maukey par logon se samvaad karne ke liye ruk jaatin or reliyon ke dauraan sthaneey netaaon va kaaryakartaaon ko pahchaan kar unase haalchaal letin
 Former state BJP president Ashok Parnami believes that the yatra has turned the wind again in favor of the BJP
 ve kehete hai, "ek haari hui baaji se alag ab to ham ye dekh rahe hai ki kaise bahut tasalli se jeet sakate hai
 Although most leaders do not agree with this claim, they believe that this visit has brought the party back to a close contest
 pratyaashiyon kaa chayansambhavit ummidavaaron ko lekar khulaa feedback hasil karne kii manshaa se teen-teen din kii do raishumaari baithken yojit kii gayi
 The first took place in Ranakpur from 14 October and the second in Jaipur from 20 October
 bhaajapa ke liye ummidavaaron kaa chayan bahut mahatv rakhata he
 Internal surveys suggest that at least half of the party's 161 sitting mlas are unlikely to win if they are re-ticketed
 in do baithkon kaa makasad yahi tha ki har seat par jeet kii sambhaavna vaale kam se kam teen daavedaaron ke naam chhante jaaen or phir un takreeban 60 vidhayakon ko shant rakhane kii ranneeti banaai jaae jinke tikat katnaa lagbhag tay he
 Raje said, "I took the confidential feedback in sealed boxes
 isi tareeke se yah sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he ki sarvshereshth pratyaashee ko hi tikat mili
 "raje involved 30 prominent leaders from all castes and groups in the process to choose the right candidate
 party jaldi hi apni sabase badi chunaav-purv kavayad shuru karegi jisamen kaaryakarta kareeb ek karod matadaataaon se sampark banane ke liye ghar-ghar jaaenge or unase bhaajapa ko phir se chunane kaa anurodh karenge
 In its survey of outsiders and party, there is a hint that about 15 percent of the voters are those who are sitting on the sidelines and they can be persuaded to give the BJP a chance again
 yah sankhya khel palatney vaali ho sakati he
 That is why in the last two months, the slogan of Shah's two dozen meetings in Rajasthan was to "vote for the party", not to ask for votes in the name of Modi or Raje
 party ke liye ek phaayde kii sthiti yah he ki usne 2003 ke baad se apane gramin aadhaar main 14 fisadi kaa ijapha kiya he
 The state unit of the aggrieved BJP has been upset with Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a long time because the state has not got any major project that can be presented as a gift from the central government to Rajasthan
 modi va raaje, donon ko hi pichhali baar rajya main baari janadesh mila lekin kai log maanate hai ki unhen badale main kuch nahin mila
 They feel that in return they got only post-demonetisation and GST
 sangh kaa samarthan rakhane vaale ek varisht bhaajapa netaa kaa kahana tha ki vyapaariyon or madhya varg ke party ke mukhya janaadhar ko yah apeksha thi ki modi kii taraf se koi badi raahat kii ghoshnaa hogi jaise ki iskar se mukti kyonki ab to har vyakti jiesti adaa kar rahaa he
 As far as the issue of rising oil prices is concerned, the party is saying that Rajasthan was the first state to cut taxes on oil even before the central government
 party maanati he ki patibaddh bhaajapa matadaataaon main is baat ko lekar gussa he ki bhaajapa jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane or ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan karne ke chunavi vaadon par khari nahin utari he
 Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has revived the Ram temple issue with his demand that the government should resort to an ordinance to build the temple
 badale main party netritv matadaataaon ko sarkaar ke anya "asaamaanya'' kadamon ke bare main bataakar aashwast karne kii koshish kar rahaa he jaise ki teen talaak ko khatm karnaa or go hatya ko rokna
 The Rajasthan government has imposed a liquor duty to raise funds for the rehabilitation of old and abandoned cows and has also changed the school curriculum to give place to Hindu and nationalist agendas
 bhaajapa ne is baat kaa bhi ehsaas kiya he ki kisi najdiki mukaable main 14 fisadi tak matadaata kisi nirdaleey ummidavaar ke paksh main vot daal sakate hai, jaisaa ki 2008 main hua tha
 Therefore, the party is also working on this strategy to allow anti-bjp votes to fall into the account of any non-congress alternative
 aisa ek morcha pehle bhaajapa main rah chuke vidhayak hanuman beniwal ke irdagird ban rahaa he
 This front can dent the votes of Congress
 gramin kshetron main sarkaar kii karj maafee kii yojana kaa phayda party ko mil saktaa he jisamen kisaanon, anusuchit jatiyon va janajatiyon or vanchit tabakon ke logon dwaara liye gaye 50,000 ru
 The debts owed were waived
 iske alaava raaje ne 6 aktubar ko is baat kaa bhi elaan kiya ki krishi bijli conekshnon ko salanaa 10,000 ru
 Subsidy will be given and this amount will be added to their accounts after they pay the bills
 jati kaa khelis baat ko bhi shiddat se mahasoos kiya ja rahaa he ki paaramparik rajput matadaataaon kaa ek bada varg bhaajapa se chhitakkar dur chalaa gaya he
 Rajputs can influence the trend of votes in about 30 seats
 congress ne iskaa laabh uthaane kii koshish kii or isiilie vah bhaajapa ke diggaj netaa rahe jaswant singh ke bete or rajput netaa maanavendra singh ko apane paale main le ai he
 In response, the BJP has also brought forward its Rajput leaders and is claiming that the BJP has always respected Rajput leaders
 rajput hameshaa se bade nishthavan rahe hai or unke liye paala badalanaa bahut mushkil hoga
 The BJP has also wisely tried to impress Jat voters, who have a good effect on 40 seats
 sarkaar ne is samudaay ke 14 afasaron ko espi niyukt kiya he
 She is also hoping that many of her angry Jat voters and party workers will move with Beniwal instead of going to the Congress
 rajya main jat obisi shrenee main aate hai or ve gahalot se naaraaz hai kyonki unhone jaaton ke liye aarakshan kaa virodh kiya tha
 In the opposition camp, the BJP has been cleverly putting the Congress campaign in the state
 isliye jab 9 aktubar ko dhaulpur main rahul gandhi ne is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki ateet main congressi mantriyon ne party kaaryakartaaon ko niraash kiya he, to bhaajapa netaa turant iskaa hawala dete hue kehane lage ki congress apane kaaryakartaaon ke saath kaisaa bartaav karti he jabaki bhaajapa to aam kaaryakarta ko sammaan dekar madanlaal saini jaise kaaryakarta ko rajya adhyaksh bana detii he
 The BJP is also attacking Manvendra Singh for saying that the illness of Goa Chief Minister and former Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is related to the Rafale deal
 party ise is tarah se prachaarit kar rahi he ki maanavendra singh or congress party kisi pranaghatak beemaari se grast vyakti kaa uphaas uda rahe hai
 No matter how active the bjp's social media is at the national level, it has failed to make any impact in Rajasthan
 kul milakar dekha jaae to raaje ke adheen bhaajapa tagdi sarkaar-virdohi lahar se bachane kii koshish kar rahi he
 It is weighing the caste equation and presenting itself as a party cared for Hindus
 tohfe hi tohfekisaanon ke liye karj maafee or balikaon ke liye sarkari kharch par schuli shiksha jaisi kalyaan yojanaon kaa laabh ho saktaa he
 Just before the Election Code of Conduct comes into force, 12 lakh farmers are given Rs 10,000 annually through DBT (direct Benefit Transfer)

 Since 1998, the BJP has expanded its reach in both urban and rural areas
 party ne apane yahaan loktantr badhaayaa he or harjaati ke liye ek bada netaa rakhane kii apni nitise nijaat paa lee he
 *** aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ab chunavi mood main aa gai he
 In view of this, BJP President Amit Shah will flag off 160 change chariots (propaganda chariots) built on Thursday at Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 audio video system se las honge parivartan rathbijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mangal pandeya ne somvaar ko bataaya ki audio-video system se las in parivartan rathon paravidhansabha chunaavako lekar badi sankhya main parche bhi rahenge
 All these chariots will reach all the 243 assembly constituencies of Bihar
 pratidin ye rath kam se kam 800 gaanvon main pahunchenge or bihar main parivartan karne kii matadaataaon se apil karenge
 He told that two-two BJP workers will also be riding on each chariot

 He informed that the people riding these chariots will be made aware of the achievements of the Central Government and will inform the bjp's policy
 unhone kaha ki bihar kii janata ab parivartan ke mood main aa gai he, yahi kaaran he ki inprachaar rathonkaa naam 'parivartan rath' rakhaa gaya he

 The booklet issued by the party has mocked Nitish Kumar and Manjhi Sarkar at all times
 yahaan tak ki cover pej par nitish ko lathi thame lalu ke charnon main dikhaaya gaya he
 BJP has also given the tagline to this cartoon of Nitish and Lalu
 mahagathbandhan ko 'jangalraj-2 kaa aagaaj' bataate hue kaha gaya he ki nitish or maanjhi kii ladaai main vikaas kaa bantaadhaar ho gaya he
 Interestingly, BJP has made more attacks on Nitish Kumar than Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi in the booklet
 bijepi netaa susheel modi ne un sambhaavnaaon ko khaarij bhi kiya he ki siem maanjhi takaraav ke kaaran nitish kumaar se alag hokar bijepi kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 Modi said, 'there are serious differences between the two, but Manjhi can never leave Nitish
 'bijepi netaa nandakishor yadav kehete hai ki nitish kumaar ko lalu prasad ke jangalraj ke khilaaf jeet mili thi, lekin nitish ne satta ke liye lalu prasad se samjhauta kiya
 That is why BJP has given it the name of 'jungle Raj-2'

 bijepi ne kaha ki bihar main 'remote kii sarkaar' he, lekin maanjhi kabhi-kabhi remote se baahar chale jate hai
 Why is there no mention of crime in the report card? According to BJP, there is no discussion of crime figures in the report card of Manjhi government

 ' Mithila region, which stood stubbornly in the path of development, has finally heard a good news
 mithila kaa hriday kshetra kahe jane vaale shahar darbhanga main airport se udaan yojana ke tahat ab flite 1 agast se shuru hogi
 This dream has now come true due to the continuous campaign on social media of some youth and efforts of the Bihar government to start air service in Darbhanga
 pehle airport ke civil inklev kaa kaary aarambh, uske baad ranve paiching kaa kaam or ab spice jet company kii ore se udaan seva ko lekar samvaadadaata sammelan se saaf he ki tay samay-seemaa ke bheetar darbhanga se udaan seva shuru ho jaaegi
 People here will no longer have to travel to Patna to visit Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore
 disambar 2018 main jab kendriya uddyan mantri suresh prabhu or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne jab darbhanga airport kaa karyaarambh kiya tha to us vakt bhi logon ko yah nahin lag rahaa tha ki june, 2019 se yahaan se udaan seva sambhav ho paaegi
 On all three routes, spicejet has gained approval for the flight
 asal main, audyogic vikaas, rojgaar or vikaas ke tamaam paimaanon par bihar kaa mithila ilaaka behad pichhadaa he
 Earlier there were paper mills, jute mills and sugar factories
 lekin vibhinn sarkaron kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se dhire-dhire band hote chale gaye
 The Ashok paper mill near Darbhanga is present as the tomb of its industrial highs, as well as the sugar mills of Lohat, Sakri and Raiyam
 darbhanga main airport kii shuruyaat, jaahir he na sirf yatayaat ke lihaaj se acha hoga or yah mithila ko desh ke vibhinn hisson ke saath teji se jodega
 Due to lack of employment in this area, youth of Mithila work in all parts of the country including Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, Pune
 agar vah chhuttiyon main ghar janaa bhi chahen to trainon kii simit suvidha se lambii duuri main aana-janaa mushkil hota he
 Also, investors have been dissuaded from investing in Mithila region due to lack of air services
 is ilaake kaa najdiki airport yaa to patna he yaa phir bagdogra
 From both places, one had to travel 6 hours to reach Darbhanga or nearby areas by road
 lekin darbhanga airport (yah airforce kaa ranve he) main vyavsaayik udaanen shuru karwaane ke liye jad-you mahasachiv sanjay jha ne kaaphi koshishen kin
 He says, "the airport was in great need in this area as a large part of the population of North Bihar lives outside here
 jo log patna se aate the to aane main jam kaa saamana karnaa hota tha or unka puraa din flite pakadaney main hi biit jaataa tha
 "the opening of the airport in the environment of lack of employment and investment in Mithila region can open doors of opportunity
 jha kehete hai, "jab koi airport banataa he to uskaa trigar effects hota he
 Whether it is industrial capital investment, whether to open a private university or invest in the health sector, an investment environment has to be created for this
 "airport adhikariyon ke mutabik, darbhanga main airport khulne se turant 500 texiyon kii jarurat hogi
 Darbhanga airport will be a means of transport to areas such as North Bihar, Purnia, Katihar, Kishanganj, Begusarai, Samastipur even Muzaffarpur and Janakpur in Nepal
 jha bataate hai ki taxi seva hi kyon, is ilaake main hotel udyog ko bhi protsaahan milegaa
 This will also generate employment
 jad-you mahasachiv ke mutabik, "darbhanga main ames khole jane kaa prastaav final ho chukaa he
 Symbiosis of Pune also wants to start a university here
 isse shiksha or rojgaar donon ke avasar paidaa honge
 This is a big opportunity
 pichley pachaas saal main mithilanchal yaa koi bada nivesh nahin aayaa
 "however, there was a credit issue between Sanjay Jha and the first BJP MP on the start of the airport and now Kirti Azad, who joined the Congress
 kirti aaazaad ne airport shuru hone ko lekar apane gyapanon ke tasviren soshal media handle se share kin
 But Sanjay Jha says, "I don't want to get into this controversy
" is shuruyaat ko lekar centre main modi sarkaar or bihar sarkaar kii bhoomika he
 The state government decides where to build the airport
 iske liye jo emoyu hota he vah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or tab ke naagarik uddyan mantri ke bich hua tha
 The flight scheme is Modi ji's plan
 or nitish kumaar ne yah tay kiya ki darbhanga main bananaa he
 Arun Jaitley was the Minister of Defense
 airforce kii taraf se clearence unne dilwaai to credit kisi or ko kaise chalaa jayega?"par airport par siyasat ko lekar kaaphi aarope pratyarope hue
 But on the JD-U ticket of Darbhanga Lok Sabha seat, Sanjay Jha, a candidate, says that the opponents created a lot of atmosphere at the airport for his efforts
 ve kehete hai ki hawaii adde ko lekar kaaphi nakaaratmakataa failaai gai or ab jab sab kuch sahi chal rahaa he to log isaki vaah-wahi luutane ke liye aage aa rahe hai
 He says, "people have jokingly even made us send fake boarding cards
 ham vikaas ke liye lambii lakeer kheenchna chaahate hai or virdohi uskaa majaak banaate hai
 People discourage rather than encourage
 par is pahal se aam logon main bahut khushi he
 The public representative here never raised any hope that this could be possible
 is lihaaj se yah bada kaam he
 "significantly, in JD-U, Sanjay Jha's stature has steadily increased
 jab nitish kumaar rashtriya janata dal ke saath sarkaar se waapas endie main aae or sarkaar kaa gathan kiya to jaankaar sutron ke mutabik usamen bhi jha kii ahm bhoomika thi or ise lekar rajd supremeo lalu yadav ne tab tippanee bhi kii thi
 Currently, Jha's status has increased after the announcement of the airport and AIIMS
 vaise darbhanga airport se udaane agast kii pehali taarikh se shuru ho sakati hai
 Actually, there are two major works left here
 landing ke liye bane ranve par ri-leering ke kaam main ek layer or bichana he or civil ankalev (jahaan booking vagairah kaa kaam hota he) us par nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he
 According to sources, the work will be done temporarily till the permanent structure is built and the construction work will be completed by May 30 and it will be given to the Airport Authority
 philhal, mithilavasi airport shuru hone ke baad band pade udyogon ke phir se shuru hone kii ummid kar sakate hai
 This will also create an investment climate and will also generate employment

 aaj dopaher desh ke ek bade santhaan ke baari-bharkam get se nikal hi rahaa tha ki vahaan khadey guard samooh ne roak liya
 With his gesture, i also backed the car and parked on the side
 shishe ke paas do-teen guard aakar baat karne lage
 From Delhi to the politics of the country
 baat lambii hui, to main unase vidaa lene kii anumati maangane laga ki daftar ke liye der ho rahi he
 Nevertheless, the main guard stopped by saying two minutes
 pehle to sabane ek swar se poocha ki aam aadmi party main kya hua
 Everyone had spoken before he spoke
 unka gussa un vishleshanon se alag tha ki aam aadmi bilkul isse prabhavit nahin he
 Say anything sir, heartbroken, the guard sahab found it very difficult while speaking, but finally said that there was no such expectation from Arvind ji
 khayr yah lekh aam aadmi party ke prasangon par nahin he
 Something else came out of their conversation, knowing that my mind wandered
 maine hi kaha tha ki kai log akhabaaron main likh rahe hai ki jab aam aadmi kii sarkaar bahut acha kaam karegi, tab aap log yah sab bhul jaayenge
 You will remember the good work
 guard sahab santusht nahin hue
 The guard group only asked what work
 maine kaha ki log kah rahe hai ki aap logon ke liye bijli pani kaa bill kam kar dilli sarkaar ne vaada to puraa kar diya he
 In this case, the guard sauntered his chest and said that i am the guard inspector
 aap to jaanate hi hai ki ham sab baahar vaale hai
 All are tenants
 puri dilli kiraayedaar or makaan maalik main banty hui he
 You know who the landlords are? meaning? Landlords are those who like BJP
 dilli sarkaar bijepi ke voter ko laabh pahunchaa rahi he
 We have voted
 ham asli voter hai aam aadmi party ke, lekin hamen kya mila
 Keep in mind that this conversation was happening with only three people, but the way a voter views the government's decision gives an interesting glimpse
 tab guard sahab ne kaha ki bijli pani jo sasta kiya he usase makaan maalikon ko phayda hua he
 Not tenants
 sarkaar saare paise inaki sabsidi par kharch karegi to hamaare liye kya karegi
 i was trying to understand what is their anger at the reduction of electric water bill
 poocha ki par aap log to is vaade se khush the
 Many people wanted then why not use it
 yah faisla to shahari garibon ke haq main hi bataaya ja rahaa he
 See sir, i live in Sangam Vihar
 paanch maale kaa makaan he
 It has all the tenants
 makaan maalik hamase das rupee unit letaa he
 Now that has not diminished either
 ham aaj bhi bataur kiraayedaar das rupaya unit hi bijli le rahe hai
 The landlord is benefiting from the relief given by the government on 400 units
 pani kaa jo bees hazaar litre kaa phayda diya he wo to puure makaan ke kiraayedaaron main bant jaataa he
 a man does not get that much benefit
 iskaa laabh bhi to yahaan ke makaan maalikon ko mil rahaa he
 You see that the landlord is one, but fifty tenants live in that one house
 phir maine kaha ki lekin jhuggi jhopadi main rahane waalon ko laabh mil rahaa hoga
 The guard guard still remained adamant
 kehane lage ki ek din aap hamaare saath aaiyegaa lekin aise car se smart banakar nahin
 We will show you how most of the slums are on rent
 unke maalik flaton main rahete hai
 Now this may be the general thing
 guard sahab ise saamaanya banaakar pesh kar rahe hon, lekin main bas unki baat sunata ja rahaa tha
 He said that we live there paying fifteen hundred rupees
 vahaan jo bijli or pani par laabh he, usase kiraayedaar ko koi laabh nahin he
 If the view of the guard is correct, then the decision which is being stated in the interest of the poor, must be reconsidered
 maine bhi kahin dilli ko kiraayedaar banaam maalik ke rup main nahin dekha tha
 Sometimes i used to watch when i was a tenant myself, but since i started living in my house, this way of seeing has stopped
 kya pataa guard sahab jaise zyaadaatar log kiraaye par hi rahete honge
 Such people are waiting to get relief from this move of Delhi government, but seeing someone else go, they have started criticizing the decision which the government is telling about the decision taken in the interest of the poor
 hamane bhi yahi sochaa tha or balki abhi bhi lagata he ki kamazor tabake ko aisi sabsidi milani chahie
 It is being found in every state
 lekin yah khyaal hi nahin aayaa ki iskaa laabh bhi vahi le ja rahe hai jo gaanvon main zamin ke maalik ke taur par sari sabsidi le jate hai
 The landless do not get anything
 us tarah se mahanagaron main kiraayedaaron ko nahin miltaa, jabaki matdaan main unka bhi hissaa hota he
 It may not be true, but the point of view of the guard presents a different perspective
 dilli sarkaar ko iskaa moolyankan karnaa chahie
 If this is the case, does the government have a way that it can extend the benefit of reducing electricity bills to tenants as well
 agar nahin to use is sabsidi par punarvichaar karnaa hi chahie
 In the process, can she afford to offend this class of landlords
 jo bhi he guard sahab se baat kar acha laga
 It is always good to get someone to see anything separately

 modi ne soobe main bijli kii haalat par rajya kii sapa sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He promised to make UP a riot-free state, accusing SP and BSP of doing vote bank politics
 congress par desh ko baantne kaa aarope lagaate hue modi ne kaha, 'madam sonia ne aarope lagaaya he ki log jehar kii kheti karte hai
 a few days ago, Madam Soniaji told Rahul ji that power is poison
 pichley 60 saal main desh main sabase zyada satta main congress rahi

 Taking a dig at the Akhilesh government on the issue of development, Modi said that electricity is not news in UP, electricity becomes news
 unhone kaha, 'meerut kii aabaadi teji se bad rahi he lekin vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 Facilities are not able to reach the people
 puraa pashchimi uttar pradesh, jiske bharose soobe kii aarthik gatividhi chalati he, uske prati bhi udaseenta barti ja rahi he
 If this is the condition of western UP, then what will happen to the ruin of other areas of the state? Why can't there be an expressway between Delhi to Meerut
 yahaan airport kyon nahin ban saktaa, jabaki centre main mantri bhi isi ilaake se hai
 Hitting out at SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Modi said, "recently the leader said that the public welfare budget in Uttar Pradesh is more than the total budget of Gujarat
 mere yahaan kam bajet hone ke baad bhi log khushhaal hai
 People are wasted even if you have more budget
 rupee kahaan ja rahe hai
 Answer it leader, the country is asking for an answer

 chini mil maalik mast hai, sarkaar bhrasht he or kisaan post hai
 At the beginning of the speech, Modi described the land of Meerut as the land of heroes
 centre sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue modi ne kaha, '1857 ke swatantraaa sangram kii 150veen saalagirah par congress ne kuch nahin kiya
 The UPA did not sing the saga of heroes because they felt that by doing so, the trust of the people would be lost from the Congress saga
 pichley 100 saal se aisa jhooth failaayaa gaya ki sirf congress ne hi aazaadee ke andolan main balidaan diya tha
 This is an insult to the martyrs

 70 ke dashak main film 'fakira' main kishor-lata kaa lokapriy geet 'tota-maina kii kahani to puraani ho gai' to aapane jarur suna hoga
 But here Maina is heartbroken by a child, not a parrot
 ek dhai varsh ke adivasee bachche ke prem main padakar maina apane bacchon tak ko bhul baithi he
 This mainna from the forest lives with this tribal child the whole time
 uske saath khelti he
 She is so attentive to her safety that if anyone bothers the child, she shows her anger by bending
 chaahe wo bachche ke parijan hi kyon naa hon
 Even this manna eats when the child eats
 baccha roe to wo bhi baichen ho jaati he
 One feels crying even in his voice
 baccha ghar se kahin jaae to vah bhi saath-saath udati he
 The case is of village Kuli located in Vananchal in Barwani district of Madhya Pradesh
 ek maina or dhai varsh ke bachche ke bich gaharaata prem ab nai kahaniyon ko janm de rahaa he
 Maina's relationship with Nana, a two and a half year old son of Kunwar Singh Barela, a tribal farmer in this village, is about a year old
 kunwar singh is maina ko jangal se le aae the
 He kept this maina in the open but instead of going back to the forest, he took heart here
 naanaa kii maa undalibai se zyada mamatv yah maina dikhaati he
 What is the matter of someone who hands over a child while he is there
 ab yah kahani aas-paas ke gaanvon ke logon ke liye bhi kautuhal kaa vishay ban gai he
 By the way birds have a parrot which is closest to humans
 log ise paalate hai or yah na keval manushya kii bhashaa samajhataa he balki parivaar kaa sadsy hi ban jaataa he
 But here this relationship has been made by Maina who usually likes to live in the open sky away from humans
 ek junglee pakshi kaa bachche se prem kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 People are seeing this as a special relationship of a past life
 maina ke liye utana hi prem is bachche kaa bhi he jo thik se abhi kuch bol bhi nahin paata
 Anyway, love is not an obsessive of any language
 vaise is rishte ko kya naam den, yah to bachche ke maa-baap bhi nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 Call this Maina as a friend of the child or a mother who shows full motherhood? However, the amazing story of Ajab Prem is captivating everyone
 'suhagaraat' shabd bhale hi logon kaa dhyaan apni ore khub khinchataa rahaa ho, par iske bare main kuch bhram ekadam kaaman paae gaye hai
 In the absence of authentic information, people are lost in myths and cannot reach the facts in time
 yahaan un top 7 mithkon kaa zikr kiya gaya he, jisaki hakeekat maaloom hona jaruri he
 Confusion 1: During intercourse for the first time, women undergo a painful and painful experience
 hakeekat:agar danpati ke bich aapasi samajhadaari ho, pyaar ho, saath hi donon aanandadaayak tareeke se Foreplay kaa istemaal karte hai, to dard hona ekadam jaruri nahin he
 Confusion 2: Sexual power can be detected by the size of a man's penis
 hakeekat: aisa mumkin nahin he
 Kamakrida's enjoyment depends on the happy mental attitude and vivacity of the couples
 aakaar na ke baraabar asar daalata he
 Confusion 3: If a man has been masturbating before marriage, for the first time he has a lot of difficulty in having sex
 vah sahi vakt se pehle hi skhlit ho saktaa he
 Reality: According to medical science, Masturbation does not affect men’s health, sexual power, fertility etc
 haa, itnaa jarur he ki agar koi shaks yah maan baithe ki vah Masturbation kii vajah se kamjor ho gaya he, to sirf uski is soch kaa nakaaratmak asar pad saktaa he
 Illusion 4: It is very important to have a light in the room at the time of meeting for the first time, so that each other can be understood properly
 hakeekat:aam taur par mahilaayein andhere main sahavaas ko tarjeeh detii hai
 Most women keep their eyes closed during sex
 ek-duusare ke 'sahyog' se lite kii kami khud puri ho jaati he
 Confusion 5: If the woman is still a virgin, bleeding from her limb is necessary during the first meeting
 hakeekat:chaahe yah kisi mahila ke liye sexual relation kaa pehla hi anubhav kyon na ho, raktasrav jaruri nahin he
 Hymen (a type of membrane) can remain Absent from birth
 bahut zyada mumkin he ki Hymen khelkud yaa kisi anya shaareerik kaam ke dauraan pehle hi nasht ho gai ho
 So it is completely wrong to draw any conclusions from such things
 bhram 6:vivaah ke baad mahilaayein suhagaraat ko hi sexual relation banane ko aatur rahati hai
 Reality: Women are eager to know their partner's behavior well before having a physical relationship
 apane partner se ve pehle-pahal sirf pyaar hi chaahati hai
 Confusion 7: The honeymoon must meet for the first time
 agar kisi bhi vajah se (shaareerik yaa maansik avasthaa) aisa nahin hota he, to isse rishte kii buniyaad shuruyaat main hi kamjor pad sakati he
 Reality: This is a gross misconception
 vivaah kii kamyaabi puri tarah se danpati ke bich pyaar or aapasi samajhadaari par nirbhar he

 indian premier lig (ipel) kii chamchamati trophy ko apane naam karne ke liye 8 timen maidan par utar chuki hai
 The Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kings XI Punjab are the biggest contenders for the title
 lekin aapako chaunkaate hue is baar sunrisers hyderabad kii team trophy par kabja kar sakati he
 The 2014 IPL was a disappointment for Hyderabad
 apane 14 main yah team maatr 6 match jeet pai thi, jabaki 8 maichon main unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 However, now a lot of changes have been made in the team from captain to players
 australia ke khatarnaak opening batsmen david warner pehali baar hyderabad kii captaini karenge
 The pool of foreign players is very strong
 
 
 sunrisers hyderabad ne is sanskaran main newjiland ke khatarnaak tej gendbaaj trent bolt ko shaamil kar badi baaji maari he
 Because Bolt is going through a very good form these days
 inke alaava jo videshi khilaadi is saal kharide gaye hai unamem england ke oin morgan, kevin petersan, ravi bopaara or newjiland ke ken williamsan shaamil hai
 However, due to county cricket, Kevin Pietersen is expected to join the final leg of the tournament
 david warner, del sten or moysis henrices pehle se hi team ke saath maujuud hai
 In such a situation, the pool of foreign players looks very strong in terms of T20
 indian super stars kii bhi he is team main bharmaar
 
 sunrisers hyderabad kii team main bhartiya super stars kii bhi kami nahin he
 Indian international players like Shikhar Dhawan, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Naman Ojha, Parvez Rasool, Karn Sharma, Praveen Kumar and Lokesh Rahul are part of this team
 haalanki T20 cricket main kayaas lagaana jokhim bharaa kaam he lekin jis tarah kaa team combination hyderabad ke paas he, usase unki daavedaari kaaphi majboot dikhaai detii he
 Only need to fix team combination
 
 If Hyderabad puts its right combination on the field, then this team can break the dreams of many big teams
 haalanki david warner kii bataur captain anubhavheenata thodaa pareshaani kaa sabab jarur ban sakati he
 But many big legends are present in the team to help Warner

 haal hi main narendra modi ne gujarat main hetric banaai he or unke samarthak unhen pradhanmantri ke pad par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Modi's coin runs in Gujarat, now it seems that Modi's branding has started from former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's stronghold
 uttar pradesh se yun to narendra bhai modi kaa koi sidhaa naata nahin he, lekin bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke varishthatam netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ke 88wein janmdin (25 disambar) se ek din pehle bijepi pradesh karyaalay or shahar main kai sthanon par lage hording tathaa binar par atal ke samakaksh lagi modi kii badi tasviir is baat kii ore ishaara kar rahi he ki sangh or bijepi ne modi kii branding atal ke garh se hi karne kaa man bana liya he
 The BJP is now preparing Chief Minister Modi for a big role at the national level, putting a hat-trick in the recently concluded assembly elections in Gujarat
 party ke padaadhikari to haalanki sidhe taur par apana munh nahin kholana chaahate, lekin dabi jubaan main vah bhi lakhanu main modi kii dhamak se inkaar nahin kar rahe
 On the 88th birthday of Atal, the city has already started a day of programs and wishes, but the subject of real discussion is the big picture of Modi appearing with Atal's picture
 raajnneetik jaankaron kii najar main modi kii is tasviir ke kuch to myne hai
 Political analyst Rashid Khan said, 'lucknow is the city of Nawabs and it has also been the traditional Lok Sabha seat of Atal ji
 vah hameshaa yaheen se lade or yahaan ke logon ne unhen dher sara pyaar bhi diya
 'khan said,' Modi's picture did not appear before on the streets of Lucknow
 main yah to nahin kah saktaa ki modi ko atal ke samakaksh khadaa kiya ja rahaa he, lekin haa, aisa lagata he ki sangh ke ishaare par bijepi loksabhaa chunaav se pehle unhen ek badi bhoomika main taiyaar karne ke prayaas main juty hui he
 On the hoardings of the birthday of Atal, there is a big picture of Modi and it is written on it - 'preparation for a big goal, now it is preparation for nationalism
 ' to kya modi kaa rashtradharm nibhaane kaa samay aa gaya he?modi kii tasveeron ko lekar outluk patrika ke varisht patrkaar kumaar pankaj kehete hai, ‘bijepi main modi ke kad kaa ab koi netaa nahin rah gaya he, isliye loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar bijepi ne modi kii alag chhavi pesh kerani shuru kar di he
 Even though Modi is talking about taking care of Gujarat right now and the central leadership of BJP is also keeping silent about Modi's claim to the Prime Minister's post, but Lucknowis feel that Modi's hoarding and the words written on it are not Huh
 lakhanu se bijepi ke saansad lalji tandon ne kuch dinon pehle hi modi ke yahaan se chunaav ladane kaa sanket de diya tha

 Lok sabha chunav Exit poll 2019 has reached its last round and exit polls will start coming after the final phase of voting on May 19
 nateezon se pehle jeet-haar kaa anumaan bataane vaale in pols par sabhi kii nigahen tiki rahati hai
 The exit poll is only part of the opinion poll
 lekin donon ke aankade nikaalane kaa tarika alag-alag hota he
 Let us know what is the difference between them and how they work to get their opinion from the voters? What is the opinion poll? Opinion poll is directly related to the voter
 isamen janata kii raay ko samajhane ke liye alag-alag tareeke se aankade jamaa kiye jate hai
 That is, different ways of talking to people, knowing their opinions are adopted
 pre pole, agsit pole or post pole opinian pole kii 3 shakhaaen hai
 But most people consider Exit Poll and Post Poll to be the same, but this is not the case
 ye donon ek-duusare bilkul alag hote hai
 What is a pre poll? Before the announcement and voting of any election, the survey you see in TV or read in newspapers that if elections are held today, which party will form the government, it is pre poll
 jaise maan lijie ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019, 11 april se 19 may tak saat charnon main honge
 The election was announced on 11 March
 jiske baad tivi channel yaa akhabaaron ne bataaya ki aaj chunaav hue to kis party ko kitni siten milengi
 It is decided by pre poll only
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019: jaaniye kya hote hai agsit pole, kaise nikalate hai aankadeegsit pole kise kehete hai?agsit pole (exit Poll) hameshaa voting ke din hota he
 Immediately after voting in the exit poll, when the voter exits the polling booth, he is asked to question him
 phir uskaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 This is called exit poll
 iskaa data voting vaale din jamaa kiya jaataa he phir aakhri voting ke din din shaam ko agsit pole dikhaaya jaataa he
 What is decided in a post poll? Post poll results are more accurate
 agsit pole main survey agency matdaan ke turant baad matadaata se raay jaanakar motaa-motaa hisaab laga leti hai
 Whereas post polls are always the next day or one or two days after the voting
 jaise maan lijie chathe charan kii voting 12 may ko hui thi
 So the surveying agency would have known their opinion from the voters by 13, 14, or 15 May, this is called post poll
 kis par karnaa chahie bharosa?iskaa sidhaa jawaab he post pole
 Sampling matters the most if you go to data
 is aadhaar par ye kaha ja saktaa he ki pre pole yaa post pole ke mukaable agsit pole ke galat hone kii sambhaavna zyada he kyonki agsit pole kii prakriya main un vaigyanik vidhiyon kaa prayog nahin ho paata he jo post pole yaa pre pole main apanaai jaati hai
 Lok Sabha Elections 2019: How are exit poll and post poll survey, what is the process of taking sample, why is it more accurate, understand it? Field work is the biggest task in getting public opinion through post poll
 isaki sampling ke liye chunavi survey karne vaali agency ke karmchaaree aam logon se milakar unki raay jaanate hai
 People who are involved in this process are given a form to fill out
 taaki matadaataaon kii pahchaan gupt rahe or wo bejhijak aapni raay de den
 This form is stored in a sealed box
 post pole main sampling sabase mahatvapurn hoti he
 Post polls are one to two days after voting
 jabaki agsit pole main voters se voting ke din raay lee jaati he
 In this mode, opinion is known from the voters at the polling booth, while for the opinion poll, the agency people go to the village, town, district level to get opinions from the people
 aise main voters ko kisi baat kii hadabadi nahin hoti he
 He puts the form in the box of the person who has voted
 bihar memloksabhasiton ke bantwaare ko lekar siyaasi galiyare main halchal machi hui he
 Here, talks are on for seat sharing in NDA
 is bich lokjan shakti party ke mukhiyaramvilas paswanaur lokjan shakti party sansadeey board ke adhyaksh chiraag paswan kii jediu ke pradhan mahasachiv kasee tyaagi or jediu netaprashanth kishorase mulaakaat karenge
 This meeting will be held today i
e
 Friday evening at 5 pm at 12 Janpath, residence of Ram Vilas Paswan, Delhi
 bataa den ki bihar main endie kii loksabhaa siton ke bantwaare ko lekar prashanth kishor ahm bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 In this regard, Nitish Kumar and Prashant Kishore have met BJP President Amit Shah in the last two days for seat sharing
 sutron kii maane to agle do se teen dinon main bihar main endie ke koun sa dal loksabhaa chunaav main kitni siton par ladega, is par aam sahmati ban jaayegi
 Earlier, Bihar Chief Minister and JDU President Nitish Kumar met BJP President Amit Shah here on Wednesday
 samajha jaataa he ki is mulaakaat main donon netaaon ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bihar main gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke bich seat bantwaare ke samjhaute par charchaa kii
 Nitish had recently said that his party had reached a respectable agreement with the BJP but did not clarify how many seats his party would contest from the total 40 seats in the state
 raajnneetik sutron ne kaha ki yah bhi faisla hona he ki jadyu koun si siton par chunaav ladegi kyonki 2014 main nitish kumaar kii party bhaajapa nit rajg kaa hissaa nahin thi
 The BJP then contested 30 seats
 ram vilaas paswan kii lok janashakti party ko 7 siten ladane ke liye mili thim or upendra kushvaha kii ralospa 3 siton parchunavaldi thi
 Before leaving the NDA in 2013, the JDU tried more seats than the BJP while in alliance

 china main aisa haadasa hua jisane har kisi ko hairaan kar diya
 The 8-year-old girl fell into the panda enclosure
 shanivaar ko china ke changdu research base of jayant pandas breeding main ye haadasa hua
 When the girl fell into the fence, three pandas were roaming there
 China Daily kii khabar ke mutabik, is haadase ke baad shichuan praant main research facility ne warning jaariki
 He said- 'pandas are not meek and polite
 pandas jaise hi do saal ke hote hai to rakh-rakhaav karne vaale log bhi duuri rakhte hai
 Please stay away from them
 ' video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ladki baade main us jagah giri jahaan se nikalnaa kaaphi mushkil tha
 The security guard tried to take him out with the help of the pole, but he could not succeed
 saikadon log us haadase ko dekh rahe the
 When the two pandas were coming towards the girl, the security guard was trying to save her
 usee vakt teesraa pandas bhi vahaan aa chukaa tha
 Seeing him, the security guard left the pole and came a little down and grabbed his hand and pulled it up
 liyu guihua naamak guard ne bacchee kii jaan bachaai
 After the video went viral on social media, the guard is getting a lot of praise
 bacchee parivaar ke saath he, haadase ke baad use aspataal le jaaya gaya tha
 From where he was soon discharged
 security researchrs ne android kii suraksha khaamiyon ko point out karnaa shuru kiya he
 Under this, it was found that the attackers can read the traffic between mobile and wifi and change it and inject malware into the website if desired
 ab ise aapako aasaan shabdon main bataa den
 Actually travel as data packets from wifi router to mobile
 aam taur par ye data ancrypted hote hai taaki koi haikar inhen intercept kar bhi le to yah jaan nahin saktaa ki is packet main kya he
 But if the internet is connected to the mobile from the wifi router and the attacker can read the traffic between your devices with wifi and let them know what you are doing on the internet, then it is really dangerous in many ways
 belgium keyu liyuven uniwarsity ke maithi vanhof kaa kahana he, ‘yah atake sabhi modern protected wifai networkapar kiya ja saktaa he, kamajori wifi standard main hi he na ki kisi khaas product main’
 This type of attack is called Key re-installation Attack i
e
 KRACK and under this, hackers also read the information of encrypted wifi network and can steal sensitive information
 researchrs ke mutabik aisi khamiyaan android or linaks besd divaais main sabase zyada hai
 It has been claimed that such attacks can also be done on new wifi which have encryption of WPA or WPA 2
 yah kamajori wifai standard main hi he jise puraa windos, mike oes, ioes, android sahit linaks oes prabhavit kiye ja sakate hai
 As of now, it is believed that the information transfer via wifi is secure and encrypted
 lekin trephic intercept karke ataikars yaa havers isamen kya he isaki jaankaree hasil kar sakate hai
 This requires a device that hackers use and can be used to steal credit card numbers, passwords, chat messages, photos, email and other types of online communication
 sirchars ne daawa kiya he ki 41 fisadi android divaais main ye khami pai gai he jisase unpar wifai atake kiya ja saktaa he
 As mentioned earlier, wifi attacks can have serious disadvantages
 chunki havers wifai trephic ko hi intercept kar sakate hai to aise main unke paas duusare kai khatarnaak mailaware inject karne kaa opshan bhi he
 For example, they can hack your smartphone, inject ransomware, or insert malware into the website, causing serious problems by changing intercepted wifi traffic
 android google kaa oparating system he, isliye sawaal google se he
 Let us tell you that Google says that the company is aware of this flaw and in the next week will give a patch update to such a device in which it has a flaw
 researchrs kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke atake se aap wifai kaa password badal kar bhi nahin batch sakate hai
 But companies have started fixing it, so users should update the firmware of their router
 uttar pradesh ke meerut main ab sadakon par namaaj nahin padhi jaaegi
 The administration has prohibited the offering of Namaz on the streets of Meerut
 abhi tak shuukravaar ko sadakon par namaaj padhi jaati thi
 Due to this, roads used to be jammed
 meerut ke esaspi ajay saahani ne aadesh jari kar kaha ki ab jile kii sadakon par namaaj nahin padhi jaaegi
 The SSP also held a meeting with all the mosques in the city and the city Qazi regarding this issue
 esaspi ne bataaya ki sadak par namaaj nahin padhane ke mudde par sabhi log sahamat ho gaye hai
 Now there is no confusion about this
 haalanki bakreed ke din namaaj padhane par chhot di gai he yani bakreed ke din hi sadakon par namaaj padhi ja sakegi
 Not only this, camel sacrifice has also been banned in Meerut on the occasion of Bakrid
 abhi tak bakreed par meerut main kuch log oont kii qurbaani dete the
 However, no one will be able to sacrifice a camel in Meerut anymore
 oont kii qurbaani ko lekar meerut ke shahar kaaji ne bhi prashasan ke saath sur milaate hue kaha ki ham shahar main kanoon-vyavastha nahin bigadanaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, we approve of administration
 ab bakreed par oont kii bali nahin di jaaegi
 Earlier, the dispute between Namaz vs Hanuman Chalisa came up in Aligarh
 hindu mahasabha ne chetavanee di thi ki agar bakreed par sadakon par namaaj padhi gai, to hindu sanghathan ke log bhi sadakon par hanuman chalisa padhenge
 After this, the Aligarh district administration banned religious programs on the streets
 is par hindu jaagran manch ne kaha tha ki agar aadesh lagu hua to jiladhikari se sadak par hanuman chalisa padhwaaya jayega
 Aligarh district collector CB Singh was also threatened by Surendra Singh Bhagour, the state general secretary of the Hindu Jagran Manch
 unhone kaha tha, 'ham jiladhikari ke aadesh ko nahin maanenge
 He is not someone to give orders
 agar hamako saarvajanik sthaan par dharmik yojit karne se roka gaya, to jiladhikari se sadak par 'hanuman chalisa' padhwaaya jayega
 ' unhone kaha, 'sibiai ko asal pramaan-patr us shaks se mil rahaa he jo aisi jagah par he jahaan se sabakuch dikhataa hai, vitt mantri (chuttee par): ‘dussahas or badai kii bhukh' jaanchakartaaon par haaavee ho gai he!' chidambaram ne airsel-mexis maamle ke paroksh sandarbh main kaha ki jab aise maamalon main jahaan aarope behad choti raashi ke bare the vahaan vishisht iees adhikariyon or anya ko 'avivekpurna tareeke se nishane par liye jane' ke dauraan sarkaar jhapai le rahi thi
 Chidambaram's name is also included in the case as accused
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'vitt mantri ne poocha he, ‘isse ham kya uddeshy puraa kar rahe hai yaa vastav main nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai?' unhen jawaab pataa he
 The reason is justice
 'glad that the fm's conscience and legal acumen have finally stirred to condemn the indiscriminate targeting of eminent bankers (in cases where the allegations are about thousands of crores of rupees)
 The CBI is investigating Chidambaram's alleged role as finance minister in the INX Media case and last month sought approval from the central government to prosecute him

 The # metoo movement from Hollywood has exposed many Bollywood celebrities
 ekaek kai peeditaaon ne apni aapbeetee sunai
 This campaign is becoming very successful, but there are some people who are using it for publicity
 soshal media par bhi kuch yugers aise hai jo is movement ko majaak main le rahe hai

 Cricket's 'god' Sachin Tendulkar is expected to come out to bat in the final innings of his first class career at the Bansi Lal Stadium in Lahli near Rohtak on Tuesday
 aise main is stadium main ek baar phir darshakon kii bheed umadane ke asaar hai
 Sachin was dismissed for just five runs on the first day of the Ranji Trophy group-a match with Haryana

 Haryana have a 222-run lead compared to the second innings, and looking at the pitch, this score could prove difficult for Mumbai
 sachin ke wicket par utarane kii sambhaavna isliye bhi balavati ho gai he kyonki mumbai castar ballebaaj wasim jafar in dinon kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 Sachin comes in to bat at fourth position
 haryana ke gendbaajon ne duusare din jis tarah kii gendbaaji kii thi, use dekhte hue mumbai ke liye nirdhaarit lakshya paanaa aasaan nahin hoga or isamen sachin ko ahm yogadan dena hoga
 This is also important because 90 percent of the crowd in Lahli will only come to see Sachin batting
 ravivaar ko bhi yahi hui tha lekin sachin ke saste main out hote hi maidan khaali ho gaya tha
 On Monday, spectators again turned to the stadium when Haryana star Joginder Sharma picked up five wickets one by one and pushed Mumbai to the backfoot
 joginder ne paanch wicket liye
 Sachin is playing the last Ranji match of his career and that is why this match has become very high profile
 sachin ko ravivaar ko donon tiimon ke khilaadiyon ne sammaan diya tha or phir haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne ek smritichihn bhi bhent kiya tha
