 In democracy, the people are the best, now the matter will be decided in the court of the people, in this mass campaign of refund, at least 50 lakh people of Bihar will join the signature campaign and will also send their sample for DNA tests to Modiji on the 29th of this month
 The first phase of this campaign will be completed with a "swabhiman Rally" in the ground jammu-kashmir police ne somvaar ko kaha ki kathua samuhik balaatkaar evam hatya cond ke maamle main adaalat se bari hue saatven aaropee ke khilaaf vah apil kar sakati he
 Significantly, a Pathankot court convicted six people in the case
 inamen se teen logon ko balaatkaar or hatya ke maamle main umrakaid jabaki anya teen ko sakshya mitaane ke dosha main paanch-paanch saal kaid kii sajaa sunai gai
 Inspector General of State Police Crime Branch A
 mujtaba ne kaha ki zarurat padane par police bari kiye gaye saatven aaropee ke khilaaf apil karegi
 It is worth noting that the case of gang-rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir in January 2018 was investigated by the Crime Branch itself
 adhikari ne chah anya logon ko sajaa sunaae jane kaa swaagat karte hue bari hue saatven aaropee ke khilaaf apil karne kii baat kahi
 He said, "we welcome the verdict, just one person was acquitted
" '' unhone kaha ki police ko abhi tak faisle kii prati nahin mili he
 The officer said, "once we study it, we will challenge it in the Punjab and Haryana High Court if needed
 '' Wednesday was a very turbulent day for Jammu and Kashmir
 shaam hone tak khabaren ye aati raheen ki pidipi-neshnal conference (ensi)-congress gathbandhan kii sarkaar ban sakati he
 Suddenly news came at 8 o'clock in the night that Governor Satyapal Malik dissolved the assembly and all the exercises to form the government came to an end
 bhang hone se pehle in teenon partiyon main kaaphi jugalbandi dekhi gai
 PDP leader Altaf Bukhari met Omar Abdullah
 udhar, congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad bhi buudhvaar shaam tak ummid bandhaate najar aae ki ‘kashmir kii raksha’ ke liye gathbandhan sarkaar banegi
 However, the reconciliation of the three parties did not last long, and soon after the dissolution of the assembly, all three tried to show that the talk of the alliance was not serious, but a period of speculation
 isamen sabase aage gulam nabi aaazaad aae or unhone media ko bataaya ki abhi aupchaarik faisla nahin hua tha
 The matter was only to hold a meeting and on this basis the Governor dissolved the assembly
 aaazaad kii ‘safai’ ke myneazad ne safai di ki gathbandhan ko lekar baat chal rahi thi lekin gambhirtha se koi vichaar vimarsh nahin hua tha
 Azad also said that there was no meeting yet, but the governor dissolved the assembly out of fear
 aaazaad ke is baat ke myne kya hai? myne koi samaj saktaa he ki congress pehle to pidipi-ensi ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kar rahi thi, lekin jab vidhansabha bhang hui to usne donon partiyon se peechha chhudaane kii koshish kii, kyonki use acchhee tarah pataa he ki pidipi or ensi khuleam panchayat chunaav kaa bahishkaar kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, why should the Congress buy its infamy that it has misbehaved with the parties who want to form the government but do not want to give panchayat rights to the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 saaf hai gathbandhan ke sanketcongress rashtriya party he jabaki ensi-pidipi kshetreey
 Therefore, the priority of the Congress will certainly be different from these two parties, but who should not make the demand for an alliance
 dabaav is baat ko lekar bhi he ki congress kisi surat main dobaaraa bijepi ko jammu kashmir main daakhil hone dena nahin chaahati
 For this he also likes the 'opportunistic' alliance
 congress aisa isliye kar rahi he kyonki vah ghati main apana alakh jagaae rakhana chaahati he
 Alakh is opposed to the actions and agenda which BJP has taken forward
 sawaal he kya isse aage kii uski raajnneeti sadhegi?raajnneeti main bahut aage kii soch ko tavajjo nahin di jaati
 The idea is to form a government soon and to be in power
 congress bhi isi li par chal rahi he
 Chandrababu Naidu's catalytic force has made him more powerful as it shows the possibility of a third front in future general elections
 agar pidipi or ensi kaa use saath mil jaae to congress ko phayda har haal main dikh rahaa he
 Congress's attention to 2019 is clear from the political movements that small parties and satraps will have a big role in the future general elections
 choti partiyaan kingmekar kii bhoomika main hongi
 The Congress knows that the Third Front is not going to be formed so soon because it can have the opposite effect and the mood of the people may go in favor of the Modi government
 isliye jabatak khulkar tisare morche kii taiyaari kaa elaan na ho, tab tak andarkhaane choti partiyon ko ekasaath laane main kya buraai he? congress philhal isi niti par chal rahi he
 The bottom line of the preparation of pdp-nc-congress in Jammu and Kashmir till Wednesday was that the government should run simultaneously for the next five months, so that its benefits would be met in the Lok Sabha elections and an atmosphere would be created against the BJP
 haalanki, aisa nahin ho sakaa or teenon partiyon kii yojana thande baste main chali dhari gai
 The congress-nc Sangat has been formed in the Congress and NC from the beginning
 rahul gandhi or umr abdulla ek umr ke bhi hai
 In 2009, Rahul Gandhi supported Omar and made him the youngest Chief Minister of the country
 rahul ne tab farukh abdulla se zyada unke bete umr ko tavajjo di or agle 6 saal tak jammu kashmir sarkaar ko samarthan dete rahe
 In 2012, there was the UPA government in Delhi and NC in Jammu and Kashmir
 us vakt rahul gandhi ne abdulla parivaar or apane parivaar ko jodate hue jawahar laal nehru ke din kii yaad dilaai thi or bataaya tha ki desh or kashmir main in donon pariwaron kaa kya yogadan rahaa he
 Therefore, the equations of both the parties have been good, there are no two opinions in this
 tabhi dilli main baithak kar ensi kaa samarthan lekar sarkaar banane kaa faisla hua tha

 The comments 15 agast 2022 ke liye sankalp lenaa he ki ham desh or samaaj kii bhalaai ke liye aage badhenge
 Every department and unit of the government should also get involved in the work
 swabhimani, samrudh, susanskrit, shreshth bharat bananaa he
 By 2022, every citizen has to work to provide electricity to every household
 bharat ke sava sau karod mere pyaare deshavaasiyon
 Best wishes to all of you on the auspicious occasion of independence
 15 agast kaa ye savera maamuli savera nahin he
 This is the dawn of the independent festival of the world's largest democracy
 sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ke sapanom kaa savera he
 This morning is the resolve of the resolve of 125 crore countrymen and on such a holy festival, due to the sacrifices, sacrifices and penance, the men who fought for the pride of India for centuries, spent youth in jail, but did not give up their dreams Chhote, i offer such freedom to the freedom fighters
 desh ke anya ganmaanya nagarikon, yuva, sahityakaron or samajaseviyon evam anya ne vishwa bhar main bharat kaa maathaa ooncha karne kaa abhinandaneey kaary kiya
 i heartily wish those countless people from the ramparts of India
 vishwa ke saamne bharat kii vishalata, bharat kii vividhta ke gungan hote rahete hai
 Just as there are many variations of India, there is greatness of India, similarly there is simplicity in the people of India and there is unity in every corner of India
 yahi hamaare desh kii shakti he
 There has been an attempt to refine him in every era
 puraatan paramparaon ke bich yah desh yahaan pahunchaa he
 Our unity, simplicity, brotherhood, harmony are huge capital
 is par kabhi daag nahin laganaa chahie
 If the unity of the country falls apart, the dreams also crumble, that is why the poison of casteism, the passion of the sect is not to be given in any way
 yah desh team india ke kaaran aage bad rahaa he
 This team India is a large team of 125 crore countrymen
 kya duniya ne sochaa he ki sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii team jab ek hokar lag jaati he, wo raashtra ko badhaati hai or bachaati bhi he
 Where we are trying to reach is due to a team of 125 crore
 loktantr main janabhagidaari sabase badi puunji hoti he
 Team India has only one mandate and that all our arrangements, all the schemes should serve the poor of this country
 ham garibi se mukti kii ladaai ko bal pradaan karnaa chaahate hai
 The poor also want to fight poverty
 15 agast ko aapke saamne kuch vichaar rakhe the, tab main nayaa tha
 What i saw in the beginning was that i had put it in front of the countrymen with no open mind, but today after a year, from the ramparts of the same Red Fort, i assure the countrymen that in a year Team India will get a new With confidence, the new potential deadline has begun to make dreams come true
 17 karod deshavaasiyon ko bank tak laane ke liye bahut ji-jaan se jutana padataa he
 The bank employees heartily congratulate the banks, because they brought the bank to the poor
 bharat jaise desh main agar vikaas kaa pyramid dekhen, to uske sabase neeche kii sataha sabase majboot hoti he
 Today, at the base of the pyramid of development, the country's Dalit, victim, is sitting neglected
 isliye hamen vikaas ke pyramid ko majboot karnaa he
 We have emphasized social security, the well being of the poor
 shramikon kaa sammaan or gaurav hamaara rashtriya kartavya, swabhaav hona chahie
 Now even after leaving work, the money of unorganized laborers will come to them
 nayaa kanoon banane kaa khel hamaare desh main chalata rahaa
 More law is not good for good governance
 garibon ke liye 44 kanoonon ko hamane samet diya
 Today i want to calculate
 main sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ko kahana chahta hum ki yah desh bhrashtachar se mukt ho saktaa he
 Corruption is like a termite in our country
 is dimak ko khatm karne main samay lagegaa
 Could have decided to end the gas subsidy of 15 thousand crores
 hamane yah gas sabsidi graahakon ke khate main sidhi pahunchaai
 Today i want to tell Team India that in the name of this subsidy, 15 thousand crore rupees was stolen annually, it stopped
 is tarah desh se gas sabsidi ke naam par chal rahaa bhrashtachar chalaa gaya
 Some people are fond of drowning in the trough of despair
 kuch log niraashaa dhundte rahete or failaate rahete hai
 If i discuss coal, some political pundits will weigh it with the scales of politics
 unase prarthana karata hum jis koyale kii charchaa karne ja rahaa he use ranjiti ke taraazoo se na tolein
 We decided that coal, spectrum and minerals will be auctioned, now three lakh crores rupees will come to the nation's coffers from the auction within the time limit
 hindustan kii sampatti luutane waalon ke khajaane band hue
 Brokers were shocked by the coal auction
 efem radio ke ocshan na karne kaa mujh par kaaphi dabaav daalaa gaya, lekin hamane paardarshita ke tahat kai shaharon main efem radio ke ocshan karwaae
 We worked in the direction of how the money of the MNREGA and the scholarship of the children goes directly to their account
 mahangaai kam karne main ham safal hue hai
 Efforts are on to bring him down further
 hamaare aane se pehle mahangaai do ankon main thi
 We found satisfactory food in the poor's plate, we are moving forward in this direction
 desh ke krishi jivan main badlaav kii bahut jarurat
 We have to increase the fertile power of the land
 50 hajaar karod rupee krishi sinchai yojana ke liye lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 We have to start a movement in our agricultural life
 purvi bharat main chaar uria fertilizer ke kaarkaane band pade hai
 By making a new urea policy, they are working towards reviving them
 desh main sena ke javaanon ke kalyaan ke jitna mahatv hi kisaan ke kalyaan kaa he
 Farmer welfare is very important
 ab krishi mantralay kisaan kalyaan mantralay ke rup main janaa jayega
 Even after so many years of independence, about 18,500 villages in the country are without electricity
 aazaadee ke prakaash se ye gaanv vanchit hai
 If we continue with the old methods, then even in 10 years, electricity will not reach these villages
 rajyon ke sahyog or sthaneey nikaayon kii madad se aane vaale ek hajaar din main 18,500 gaanv main bijli pahunchane kaa kaam karenge
 Coal is among the tribals, so they should be taken care of
 yah varsh dow
 It is the year of 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar
 har bank branch yah sankalp kare ki apane ilaake main jahaan tribal basti ho, jahaan nahin he, vahaan daliton ko, har bank branch ek dalit-adivasee ko start ap ke liye lone de
 This will generate 1
25 lakh Dalit entrepreneurs in our country
 mahila udhyamiyon ke liye bhi bank madad karen
 This will create new entrepreneurs and change the economic life of the country
 desh kaa faujee raashtra kii sampatti he
 The 'one Rank One Pension' proposal came before every government
 abhi tak main ise nahin kar paaya, lekin main vishwaas dilaataa hum, siddhantat: 'van rank-van pension' hamane sweekaar kiya hua he or iske sanghathanon se baat chal rahi he
 Keeping in mind that everyone should get justice, we have found a way

 Other distinguished citizens of the country, youth, literature and social workers and others have done a commendable job of raising the forehead of India around the world
 anginat un logon ko bharat kii pracheer se hriday se shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 The vastness of India in front of the world, the diversity of India is glorified
 jaise bharat kii anek vividhtaayen hai, bharat kii vishalata he, vaise hi bharat ke jan-jan main saralata bhi he or bharat ke kone-kone main ekta bhi he
 This is the power of our country

 This country is moving forward because of Team India
 yah team india sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii vrihad team he
 Has the world thought that when a team of 125 crore countrymen unite, they increase and save the nation
 ham jahaan pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, wo sava sau karod kii team ke kaaran he
 Public participation is the biggest capital in a democracy

 i had some thoughts before you on August 15, when i was new
 maine jo shuru-shuru main dekha tha usko koi laag-lapet ke bina khule man se deshavaasiyon ke saamne rakh diya tha, lekin aaj ek saal ke baad usee laal kile kii pracheer se deshavaasiyon ko vishwaas dilaataa hum ki ek saal main team india ek nae vishwaas ke saath, nae samarthy ke samaysima main sapanom ko saakaar karne main jute gai he
 It takes a lot of hard work to bring 17 crore countrymen to the bank
 bank ke karmchaariyon, bainkon kaa hriday se abhinandan karata hum, kyonki unhone bank ko garibon ke saamne laakar rakh diya
 If you look at the pyramid of development in a country like India, then its bottom surface is the strongest
 aaj vikaas ke pyramid ke aadhaar main desh kaa dalit, peedit, upekshit baitha he
 So we have to strengthen the pyramid of development
 hamane saamaajik suraksha, garibon kii bhalaai par bal diya he
 Respect and pride of workers should be our national duty, nature
 ab kaam chhodane par bhi asangathit mazdooron kaa paisa unke paas aayega
 The game of making new laws continued in our country
 zyada kanoon sushasan ke liye thik nahin
 We included 44 laws for the poor
 aaj main hisaab dena chahta hum
 i want to tell the 125 crore countrymen that this country can be free from corruption
 bhrashtachar hamaare desh main dimak kii tarah laga hua he
 It will take time to finish this termite
 15 hajaar karod kii gas sabsidi ko saadhe khatm karne kaa nirnay le saktaa tha
 We passed this gas subsidy directly to the customers' account
 aaj team india se kahana chahta hum ki is sabsidi ke naam par salanaa 15 hajaar karod rupaya chori hota tha, vah band ho gaya
 In this way, there was corruption in the name of gas subsidy from the country
 kuch logon ko niraashaa kii gart main doobane kaa shauk hota he
 Some people keep on finding and spreading despair
 agar koyale kii charchaa karuunga to kuch raajnneetik pandit use raajnneeti kii taraazoo se tolange
 Pray to them, do not weigh the coal you are going to discuss with Ranjeeti's scales
 hamane nirnay liya koyala, spectrum or khanij kii nilaamee kii jaaegi, ab samay seemaa main nilaamee se teen lakh karod rupee desh ke khajaane main aaenge
 Treasures of those who looted the wealth of Hindustan closed

 Four urea fertilizer factories in eastern India are closed

 The welfare of the farmers is as important as the welfare of the army personnel in the country

 Now the Ministry of Agriculture will be known as the Ministry of Farmers Welfare
 aazaadee ke itane varshon baad bhi desh main kareeb 18,500 gaanv bina bijli ke hai
 These villages are deprived of the light of freedom
 agar puraane tareekon se chalate rahe to 10 saal main bhi in gaanvon main bijli nahin pahunchengi
 With the help of states' cooperation and local bodies, in the coming 1000 days, 18,500 villages will be electrified

 This year, Dr

 This country is moving forward because of Team India
 yah team india sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii vrihad team he
 Has the world thought that when a team of 125 crore countrymen unite, they increase and save the nation
 ham jahaan pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, wo sava sau karod kii team ke kaaran he
 Public participation is the biggest capital in a democracy

 It takes a lot of hard work to bring 17 crore countrymen to the bank
 bank ke karmchaariyon, bainkon kaa hriday se abhinandan karata hum, kyonki unhone bank ko garibon ke saamne laakar rakh diya
 If you look at the pyramid of development in a country like India, then its bottom surface is the strongest

 So we have to strengthen the pyramid of development

 Respect and pride of workers should be our national duty, nature
 ab kaam chhodane par bhi asangathit mazdooron kaa paisa unke paas aayega
 The game of making new laws continued in our country

 We included 44 laws for the poor
 aaj main hisaab dena chahta hum
 i want to tell the 125 crore countrymen that this country can be free from corruption

 In this way, there was corruption in the name of gas subsidy from the country

 An investigation by India Today's Special Investigation Team has exposed a gang in the National Capital Region (NCR) that was falsely pretending to benefit under the pm's flagship housing scheme
 bataa den ki is giroh ne greater noida ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main apana jaal bicha rakhaa tha
 Unfortunately, two buildings have been demolished in the same area recently
 india today ke andercover reporters ne shahberi gaanv main apni jaanch se pataa lagaaya ki kis tarah sthaneey builder rihaishi sampattiyon main avaidh tareeke se paanchaven or chathe floor kaa nirmaan jari rakhe hue hai
 The fall of two buildings in July this year has also not affected these builders
 shahberi gaanv dilli se ek ghante se bhi kam drive kii duuri par he
 Worse is that these builders are offering arbitration to get loan for PM Awas Yojana even on illegal constructions
 india today ke andercover reporters ne shahberi gaanv main ‘gudwil real estate’ kaa rukh kiya, jiskaa sanchaalan chand or uske pita samim karte hai
 The Undercover reporter expressed his desire to buy the illegal floor built by him as a fictitious landlord
 samim ne bina kisi lagalpet kaha, ‘aapako sach bataaun to ham pehle hi atirikt nirmaan khadey kar chuke hai
 'reporter -' So you have made the extra floor? 'shamim -' He has no problem
 jo bhi ham bechenge ham usko lekar paardarshee rahenge
 Under each such building i have my own office
 ’reporter-‘lekin tumhaara khud kaa hi kahana he ki paanchaven or chathe floor avaidh hai, agar unhen giraaya gaya to phir kya hoga?’samim-‘uske liye ham hai yahaan, sar
 'shamim guaranteed complete protection from any possible government action
 samim ne saath hi awaas yojana ke tahat sabsidikrut karz dilwane main bhi puri madad kaa vaada kiya
 Shamim - 'you will get a subsidy of Rs 2
5 lakh (under the scheme)
 kya aap pradhanmantri awaas yojana chaahate hai
 We will get you that
 ’samim ne daawa kiya ki usne apane sabhi graahakon ko awaas yojana karj dilaane ke liye madhyasthata kii
 Shamim said, 'we tell all our customers about this (housing scheme loan)
 lekin kuch ke paas kaagazat nahin hote
 We have our own man (in a loan agency)
 ham apane graahak ko usase apane bhai ke taur par milaate hai or usee ko farm bharne ke liye kehete hai
 If you get the scheme (subsidy), buy it, otherwise you will leave
 thik he
 'undercover reporter-' If we buy a flat under PM Awas Yojana, can we sell it later? ’samim-‘haa, bilkul aap aisa kar sakate hai
 Whoever buys it will get it (subsidized debt)

 unhone kaha, "aaj kadaa faisla nahin liya gaya to kal ye sarkaar pension vidheyak lekar aegi or aapkaa sara pension le lenge
 Similarly, prices will be increased

 jiske baad hi maamla aage bade
 The Congress feels that if the matter comes out first, then the matter may go wrong
 isliye congress sibbal ke formule ko chhupaae baithi he
 She wants the deal to be done directly, if the formula comes out in the middle, then the matter can get worse
 aise mil saktaa he hardik kaa samarthanvaise rajya sarkaar sanvaidhanik bare main kis had takaarakshanke formule ko lagu kar sakati he yah sibbal bataa denge
 But if stuck in the middle, the effort will be to put the entire matter at the center
 yani rajya sarkaar apni ore se hardik patel kii puri maang na maane or baad main hardik or congress milakar kahen ki rajya or centre chaahate to yah aarakshan patidaaron ko mil jaataa
 The bjp's state government and the Center did not do so
 isliye patidaar aarakshan se vanchit rahe
 Ultimately, the Congress can go ahead on this formula and seek Hardik's support in the state
 aise main hardik or congress milakar bijepi par nishaanaa saadh sakate hai
 After all, Congress is talking about heartache after Alpesh and Jignesh
 lekin uski koshish he ki hardik, jignesh or alpesh apane votaron ke bich congress ke saamne jhukate hue naa najar aaen
 Rather, talk to Congress about their interests
 jisase unka voter unke saath rahe or congress kii madad kar saken
 With this fight, the Congress is continuously running its political pieces on the chess board of Gujarat

 At the same time, Ahmed Patel is executing his strategy from behind the scenes to avoid the Hindu Muslim village of BJP

 raksha mantralay ko apana prastaavit raksha bhoomi prabandhan vidheyak sansad main pesh karnaa abhi baaki he
 If a scamster made his manual to loot military land, it would be something like this: 1
 kamjor nas vaale raksha or sainya adhikariyon kii pahchaan
 Almost all the land scandals have seen the nexus of the officers
 On January 31, the CBI had former Deputy Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General (rita)
 ) nobel thamburaj ke ghar par ek bhoomi ghotaale main unki kathith bhagidaari ke silsile main chapa maaraa
 An army press release said that Thamburaj had entered into an agreement outside the court with a builder, which resulted in the government getting Rs 45 crore in the Pune cantonment area
 mulya kii beshkeemtee 0
 96 acres of land was lost
 pichley paanch varshon main ujagar adhikansh sainya bhoomi ghotaalon main dephence estate adhikariyon kii sena adhikariyon or nijee developaron ke saath santhganth pai gai he
 No need to delve too deeply to know the reason
 sainik addon par dijidii kaa pratinidhitiv dephence estate ke adhikariyon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 These officers are guardians of military land
 bhoomi kaa istemaal sena karti he
 In all the 62 cantonment boards across the country, the local administration is headed by the General Officer Commanding of that military zone
 chhavnee kshetra ke bheetar imaaraton ke nirmaan kii anumati board detaa he

 us jameen ko nishaanaa banaao, jo sainya record main darj na hoghotalebaj jameen ke dastavej kamjor hone kaa laabh uthaate hankul faujee jameen kaa 25 fisadi aisa he jiskaa byora dephence estate department ke bhoomi record main darj nahin he
 Slack bureaucracy is to blame for this
 jab land-holding aspasht hoti he, to yah jameen hadapney waalon dwaara noche jane ke liye zyada mufeed ho jaati he
 For example, in the Adarsh scam, a housing society formed by retired military officers and defense estates officials, he built houses on a prized plot the size of a football field in Colaba, South Mumbai
 jameen sena ke paas thi, lekin swaamitv rajya sarkaar ke paas tha
 There was no record available
 dephence estate or sainya adhikariyon kii jugalbandi ne aage badhkar ek vanidgiyak rihaayshi tower bana daalaa

 It has been observed that many times land grabbers buy private land around the vacant defense land and then gradually surround the defense land
 yah kaam 2009 main ujagar hue srinagar vayusena bhoomi ghotaale ke maamle main kiya gaya
 1500 crores Rs
 se zyada kii lagbhag 200 acre beshkeemtee raksha bhoomi chori chhipe kai varshon main bech di gai
 Defense estate officials used to issue a No Objection Certificate to show that the land never belonged to the Ministry of Defense, whereas the Ministry of Defense bought it in 1966 itself
 isi tarah ek angrejon ke jamaane se chali aa rahi cheez he, camping ground, jo sainik kshetron ke bahari ilaakon kii taraf hota he
 It is also considered suitable for hunting
 dijidii se apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apane land-bank kii sthiti parakhane ke liye jameen kaa audit karegaa
 The last large-scale audit was in 2000
 vibhaag har varsh apane kabje vaali jameen kaa pehle se kam akalan pesh kar detaa he
 The encroachments have been described as 'a complex socio-economic problem'
 vivaadit bhukhndon ke survey, jinka aadesh samay gujaarne ke liye de diya jaataa he, rajya sarkaar ke saath milakar kiye jate hai or inamen paanch varsh se bhi zyada samay lag saktaa he
 The responsibility of protecting the land gets mixed up and the ownership of the land is also unclear
 doshi adhikariyon ko sirf tab sajaa milti he, jab saarvajanik taur par baari shor-sharaaba ho gaya ho
 CBI is currently investigating three defense land scams - Adarsh, Kandivali and Lohegaon, Pune
 2011 main ujagar hue lohegaanv bhoomi ghotaale main, teen ghotalebaajon ne 800 karod ru
 The fake documents claiming ownership of 69 acres of military land were prepared

 Target Old Grant Bungalows Buyers offer to demolish old houses and build new residential buildings at that place Old Grant Bungalows are British-era houses built on prized government land
 zyaadaatar sainik adde or chhavniyaan in bangalon se pati padi hai
 They are now prized, because the ground they are standing on has become prized
 is jameen kaa swaamitv sarkaar kaa hota he
 The way is that the builder reaches the original tenants and pays them the money
 bangalon ko 'di-hair' kiya jaataa he-yani vah prakriya jisamen sarkaar kiraaya vasuulana band kar detii he
 The builder then approaches the Cantonment Board and offers to demolish the 'dilapidated' building and replace it with a new residential building
 2011 main bharat ke niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak ke kiye gaye audit main lakhanu, almoda, kanpur, ranikhet or bareli main sainya kshetron main aise 16 bangalon kaa ullekh is rup main he ki inhen 150 karod ru
 Has been sold illegally
 aise kai or maamle bhi audit adhikariyon kii nigaah se guzar rahe hai
 In Meerut Cantonment, schools, colleges and residential buildings have been built in place of the old Grant Bungalows

 It is estimated that about 13,000 cases are pending in various courts regarding defense land
 in maamalon se jis dhang se nibata ja rahaa he, vah chintajanak he
 The government does not timely file its responses during the hearing of pending cases and the court process drags on for decades
 controlar general of dephence accounts (sijidie) dwaara taiyaar kii gai ek report main suzav diya gaya he ki dephence estate vibhaag ke paas unke mukademe ladane ke liye ek pruthak kanoonee vibhaag hona chahie
 No one noticed this suggestion
 raksha mantralay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''dephence estate ke adhikari khud ko halaat ke maare kii tarah pesh karte hai
 Corrupt officials have the right to present weak legal defense in the court on behalf of the government, so that they lose the case
 ''sijidie ke adhikari kehete hai ki desh bhar main kanoonee vivaadon main 'hajaaron karod rupayon' kii jameen fansi padi he
 a case worth considering in this case is a six-acre plot of land on defense land in Secunderabad, on which the Defense Accounts Department has built houses
 2002 main hycourt kaa faisla ek nijee form ke paksh main gaya
 But the Ministry of Defense appealed against this decision and the case is going on in the Supreme Court
 is maamle main mantralay ke samaksh jo vikalp hai, ve kaaphi gambhir hai
 Either he will have to demolish all the buildings and return the land to the private society, or the market price of the land will be Rs 100 crore

 kanvad main jal bharkar shivlinga yaa jyotirling par chadhaane kii parampara hoti he
 Lord Shiva had served in the spring and devotees offer water to the Lord to calm the flame of that poison
 kanvad ke jal se bhagwaan shiv kaa abhishek karne se tamaam samasyaayein dur hoti hai or tamaam manokamanaayen puri hoti hai
 Those who offer water to Lord Shiva as a rule by Kanwar, do not fear death
 kanvad uthaane ke niyam kya hai?-- kisi pavitra nadi se jal bharkar shivlinga par jal arpit karnaa chahie
 The water of the river Ganges is the best
 - kanvad ke jal ko bhoomi par nahin rakhana chahie
 - Those who also take kavad, such people eat food for a time, and keep chanting Shiva mantra
 - kanvad uthaane vaale vyakti ke ghar main bhi satvik bhojan bananaa chahie
 - Wearing saffron clothes should raise kavad so that the energy level remains balanced and the power remains
 - agar kanvad uthaane vaale vyakti kaa swasthya bich main karaab ho jaay to koi or bhi uski jagah kanvad uthaa saktaa he
 How to take advantage of the trip to the house at Hikwanwar? - Circulate the Shiv temple for 27 times by filling water in the lotus or by filling the Ganges water
 Do- Place some remaining water in the lotus and sprinkle it in every corner of the house- If you do this process on Monday, you will get the best fruit

 madhavan ke saath kaam karti najar aaengi
 But now the actress is in discussion about a new case
 jaankaree ke mutabik anoushka apane filmi kariyar par purna viraam lagane ja rahi hai
 The speculation on this matter is also getting stronger because Anushka has not been seen in any film for more than a year
 yadi produsar-riter kona venkat kii film ko chhod den to kisi bhi nai film ke saath unka naam judata dikhaai nahin diya he
 There are discussions that Anushka, who played an important role in the film Bahubali, will no longer be seen on the big screen
 ab vah thodaa vakt khud ko dengi or ghoomane-phirane ke liye vakt nikaalengi
 On the other hand, people close to the actress say that such news has no merit and Anushka's fans can breathe peacefully
 anoushka kii film silence kii baat karen to iskaa ek poster pichley saal jari kiya gaya tha uske baad se is bare main koi nayaa impruvement saamne nahin aayaa tha
 It has been almost 6 months since the film's poster was released
 haalanki itane lambey vakt baad haal hi main yah khabar bhi saamne ai ki is film main hollywood star maaikel madsen villen kaa kirdaar nibhaate najar aaenge
 The news of Anushka leaving the cinema came into the limelight when it was learned that her family was looking for a boy to marry
 kuch hi vakt pehle anoushka ke parivaar ne kedarnath main puja-archana kii thi
 Apart from this, there were also reports of Anushka and Prabhas being in a relationship, although Bahubali actor Prabhas made it clear in the Karan Johar hosted show Koffee with Karan that there is nothing like it

 The 'stubbornness' of Mahendra Singh Dhoni's accusation against James Anderson was severely criticized by the British media and said that it smelled of opportunism and that the fast bowler's absolution is humiliating for India

 DISAPPOINTING! Oh Gawd
 How i don’t miss this sitting in one place for hours
 Totally unlike me
 https: / / t
 co / n9djhx3j0c jayshri bajoriyabharat 'ajanabi ke khatre' ke dar kaa jawaab dene ke kram main yon aparaadhiyon kaa database banane vaala duniya kaa nauvaan desh ban gaya
 It contains personal details of the perpetrators of rape and sexual assault
 saal bhar puraane is database main 5 lakh naam hai or sarkaar kaa kahana he ki police iskaa istemaal 'niyamit nigaraanee or trekking' ke liye karegi
 Strong efforts at every level of the government to stop sexual abuse and punish criminals are very important and to justify this database, officers repeatedly cited the person who committed such crimes
 magar aparaadh ke naveenatam aankade bataate hai ki 2016 main balaatkaar ke 38,947 maamalon main se kareeb 95 fisadi main aaropee peedita kaa parichit tha
 As long as there is no better provision of law enforcement and adequate defense measures, this database will not be effective in bringing changes
 andhadhundh yon hinsa se kargar tareeke se nipatane kii janata kii maang kaa dabaav sarkaar ke upar he
 But instead of immediate solutions related to populist and technology, the government should work hard to break down the deep-rooted structural barriers that come in the way of victims to tell about these crimes and get justice
 human ritis watch ke liye 2017 kii apni report 'evarivan blams me: bariers tu justise and saport sarvice for sexual asolt cervivers in india' main maine paaya ki yon hamale kii khaskar vanchit tabake kii peediton ko police main report darj karte vakt ab bhi behisaab baadhaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In police stations and hospitals, they often have to face humiliation, undergo stigmatizing medical tests like the 'two Finger Test' and have no protection to avoid retaliation for the accused
 unhen swasthya dekhbhaal, salaah-mashvira or kanoonee sahaayta hasil karne main bhi khaasi dikkatein aati hai
 The government has not yet put in place effective mechanisms to prevent child sexual abuse
 divyang mahilaon or ladakiyon ko to or bhi zyada chunautayon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Studies by Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union show that public registrations of sex offenders in the US have caused more harm than help
 falswaroop aise purv aparaadhiyon ke saath utpeeda, bahishkaar or hinsa hoti he or unke punarvaas main dikkatein aati hai
 The database in India contains the Aadhar card details including the names, addresses, photographs, fingerprints and biometric data of each such person
 sarkaar kahati he ki database philhal keval kanoon lagu karne vaale afasaron ko sulabh hoga
 However, the officers agree that in future, the database will also include those who were accused but not found guilty
 database saarvajanik karne kii sambhaavna bhi khaarij nahin kii gai he
 The tender sought by the government for the creation of the database stated that it would include all those including children who have been arrested, charged or convicted for sexual offenses
 doshiyon kii jaankaree saarvajanik hogi jabaki baaki jaankaree keval kanoon lagu karne vaali agenciyon ko sulabh hogi
 It was proposed to divide such people into 'low', 'medium' and 'high risk' individuals
 kisi shaks ko isamen shaamil kiya jaataa he yaa nahin, ye baat durupyog kii ashanka se bharpoor puraane jamaane ke kanoonon par nirbhar he
 The government has recently moved towards acquiring automated face recognition systems to improve the identity of criminals and apparently the police system, raising concerns about privacy, espionage and freedom
 bharat main rape kii report kam darj karwaai jaati hai
 This is due to social stigma, conviction of the victim, poor response of the criminal judicial system and absence of national law to protect the victim and witnesses
 aaropee or police kii taraf se peedit par report na likhaane kaa baari dabaav padane kii baari ashanka bani rahati he
 In the case of children, there is more fear of pressure from family and society
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is database se niztaa kaa hanan nahin hoga
 But the absence of laws to protect privacy and data in India raises concerns
 jab swayambhu rakshakon kii hinsa bad rahi he, data main send or isamen naam shaamil kiye jane kii afvaah khaastaur par khatarnaak he
 Very little is known about the dissemination of database information and also whether this can continue to be biased
 kya yah jaankaree sambhavit karmchaaree kii prishthbhumi kii jaanch-padtaal kar rahe niyokta ko milegi?yon aparaadhon se nipatane ke liye sarkaar ko mahila or bal adhikaar samoohon ke saath najdiki se milakar kaam karnaa chahie, taaki pramaan aadhaarit samaadhaanon par dhyaan dete hue aapraadhik nyaay pranali main sudhaar laayaa ja sake or peedita kendrit nazariye ko badhaava diya ja sake
 The sex offenders register is not the answer
 jayshri bajoria human ritis watch kii 2017 kii report evarivan blats me: bariers tu justise and saport sarvice for sexual asolt cervivers in india kii lekhika hai

 Former India coach Greg Chappell has given rise to fresh controversy over Rahul Dravid in his new book, saying that if Dravid could have got as much support as he provided to the rest of the captains, he would have been the most successful captain in the country

 The Election Commission has reminded the government about VVPAT at least 11 times since June 2014
 pichley saal naseem jaidi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko is sandarbh main patr likhaa tha
 On April 7, Minister of State for Law PP Chaudhary said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, "the Election Commission's proposal in the context of VVPAT is under consideration with the government

 The Commission is committed to providing vvpats with evms in future elections so as to increase transparency in the electoral process, preserve voter loyalty and increase voters' confidence in the voting process
 ’’ chunaav ayog june, 2014 se vivipieti ke bare main sarkaar ko kam se kam 11 baar yaad dilaa chukaa he

 desh ke purv mukhya aarthik salaahkaar (siie) arvind subramanyam ne ek baar phir sarkaar kii jidipi growth ke aankadon par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Along with this, Arvind Subramanian said that the government's arguments on GDP figures are not solid
 darasal, haal hi main purv siie arvind subramanyam ne apane ek shodh patr main daawa kiya tha ki centre kii narendra modi sarkaar jidipi growth ke aankade badha-chadhaakar dikhaa rahi he
 In this paper Arvind Subramanian claimed that the economic growth estimates during 2011-2016 were 2
 5 fisadi ank tak badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya
 This was a period when the Indian economy was facing many problems like decline in exports, double problem of company-bank accounts, drought and demonetisation
 arvind subramanyam ke mutabik udyog ko vaastavik karj or vaastavik nivesh ke aadhikarik aankadon main badi giravat ai he
 But the new GDP series launched in 2015 shows that despite these tremors, GDP has not declined much and this 7
 7 fisadi se ghatakar 6
 Came to 9 percent
 yah sawaal khadaa karata he? kya yah sambhav he ki in paanch bade pratikul jhatkon kaa jidipi vruddhi par itnaa kam asar padaa hoga
 The government did not give a concrete reply
 Subramanian said, "in January 2015, the CSO (central Statistics Office) released estimates regarding new base year (2011-12 instead of 2004-05), new data and new methods
" meri team or maine in anumaanon kaa saavdhaneepurvak gaur kiya or tunrat naye aankade ko lekar sawaal uthaaye lekin iske baavjood koi thos jawaab nahin mila
 That is why we started voicing our doubts internally and then publicly raising it

 He said that the NDA government brought reforms like GST and Debt Insolvency and Insolvency Act but it would benefit in the medium term
 subramanyam ne utpaadakta main vruddhi kii daleel ko bhi khaarij karte hue kaha ki agar aisa hota to adhik laabh ke rup main companiyon kaa munafa badha hua dikhataa

 Indian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Bagle said on this article, 'all editorials or views are subjective
 is maamle main bhi aisa hi he
 The tendency to doubt the mandate that has come out of the country or abroad in a purely democratic manner raises a question mark
 'bataa den ki is america akhbaar ne 'hindu kattarpathiyon se modi kii galabahiyaan' sheershak se chape lekh main kaha tha ki 2014 main chune jane ke baad se hi, modi 'apni party ke kattar hindu base kaa tushtikaran karte hue vikaas or aarthik pragati ke dharmanirpeksh lakshyon ko pramot kar dhokhe kaa khel' khel rahe hai
 It was also said in this editorial that Prime Minister Modi's party Bharatiya Janata Party making 'firebrand Hindu Saints' as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh is a "shocking insult" for religious minorities

 On the third day of the winter session on Wednesday, there was a ruckus in both houses of Parliament
 rajyasabha main kaveri nadi par baandh banaae jane ke virodh samet anya muddon par ediemke, diemke saansadon samet vibhinn dalon ke sadasyon ne wel main aakar pradarshan kiya
 After this, the proceedings of the Upper House were adjourned for the entire day only after 10 minutes
 rajyasabha kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi puure sadan ne maun rakhkar sansad hamale kii barsi par shaheedon ko yaad kiya
 Since then, there was a continuous uproar in the House
 saansadon ke vyavhaar se naaraaz sabhapati venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki sadan sabhi muddon par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he lekin charchaa niyamon ke mutabik hi kii jaaegi
 Taking a dig at the uproarious mps, the Chairman said that today 9 people had lost their lives while protecting us and Parliament and all of us have just paid tribute to them, at least today let the proceedings of the House go on
 unhone kaha ki sabhi saansad apni seat par jaakar baith jaaen, is hangaame se kharaab sandesh jayega
 Even after this, the Speaker adjourned the house till Friday after the commotion did not stop
 udhar, loksabhaa main bhi ram mandir, rafel deal, andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang or kaveri muddon par shivasena, congress, tidipi or ediemke ke saansadon ne hangaamaa kiya
 First 11 minutes after the commencement of Lok Sabha proceedings

 The anniversary of the Parliament attack is the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Parliament of the country
 saal 2001 main aaj hi ke din 5 bandookdhaariyon ne sansad parisar par hamalaa kar vahaan andhadhundh goliyaan barasaai thim
 The attack killed 5 Delhi Police personnel, a woman officer of the Central Reserve Police Force, two Watch and Ward employees of Parliament House, a gardener and a cameraman
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sansad hamale main shahid hue logon ko guuruuvaar ko shradhanjali di or unki veerta ko salaam karte hue kaha ki unki bahaduree logon ko prerana detii he
 Apart from this, all the mps paid tribute to the martyrs by placing flowers on the photographs of the martyrs in the Parliament complex
 dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar aane se baad se hi mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich takaraav kii sthiti dekhne ko milti rahi he
 After the departure of former Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung, the Kejriwal government has a figure of thirty-six even with the new Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
 kejariwal sarkaar aarope lagaati he ki uparajyapal unhen janakalyaan kii yojanaayen lagu nahin karne dete
 Whatever work the AAP government does, the Lt
 Governor obstructs it, because the final order belongs to them
 uparajyapal ke bahaane aam aadmi party bijepi kii centre sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaati he
 The real reason for the confrontation between LG and the government is the union territory of Delhi
 jiske chalate yahaan centre sarkaar ke numaayinde ke taur par niyukt uparajyapal ko sabhi shasnadesh lagu karne or sarkaar ke kisi bhi faisle par antim muhar lagane kaa adhikaar he
 The same thing happens to Kejriwal and he continues to accuse LG and the Modi government
 is puure takaraav ke pichhiravind kejariwal ye 10 tark dete hai-1
 There is no right to appoint, transfer-posting and take action against peons to officers
 isliye sarkari mulajim chuni hui sarkaar ke aadesh nahin maanate

 anti karpshan branch ko uparajyapal ke adheen kiye jane ke baad se sarkaar bhrasht karmchaariyon or adhikariyon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar paa rahi jisase sarkaar main bhrashtachar badha he
 This has pushed the government's campaign against corruption
 5
 Due to the Lt
 Governor being the last authority to implement the policy decisions, the elected government could not implement many schemes
 6
 Many schemes like the CCTV scheme, plans to set up new mohalla clinics, home delivery of services, home delivery plans of ration were disrupted for a long time
 7
 It is necessary to send every file to the Lieutenant Governor for approval and the Lieutenant Governor sits on the files for a long time
 8
 The Lt
 Governor dismissed the appointments of advocates and experts appointed by the government which affected the work of the government
 9
 He did not reverse the policy decision of the government due to the cabinet's advice not binding on the Lieutenant Governor
 10
 It has become difficult for the central government to run the government in Delhi without power and after the High Court orders on it

 team india ke ballebaaji puri tarah ladkadaa gai or 323 ke pahaad jaise lakshya kaa peechha karne aasaan bhi nahin tha
 But for India in this desolate match, a chance came when the players' faces blossomed

 It was nothing short of a tough test for Chahal, who has given the batsmen sweat from his spin because tailors have a lot of strength in front of England bowling

 Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have come together to compete with BJP
 areldi ko bhi saath laane kii koshishen jari hai
 How will this alliance affect the election results? Aaj Tak tried to know this in the mood of the survey country with Karvy Insights
 ye survey 2478 logon par kiya gaya
 The survey was conducted from December 28 to January 8 in a total of 20 Lok Sabha constituencies
 survey ke nattejey hairaan karne vaale hai
 If the BSP-SP and RLD alliance came together in the Lok Sabha elections, the election results would be completely opposite to the 2014 results
 2014 main bijepi ne upi kii 80 main se 71 siten jiti thim jabaki do siten uski sahyogi apni dal ko mili thim
 The SP had got only five seats and the Congress two
 areldi or bahujan samaaj party kaa to khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha lekin survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki is baar aisa hone nahin ja rahaa
 If SP-BSP and RLD contest elections together, this alliance will capture 46 percent of up's votes
 gauratlab he ki 2014 main sapa ko 22
 2 per cent, 19 to BSP
 6 fisadi or areldi ko ek fisadi vot mila tha
 The results of the survey showed that if these three parties contested together, their vote share would be 42 in 2014
 8 fisadi se badhkar 46 fisadi ho jayega jo 2014 kii paanch siton ke mukaable 2019 main inhen 58 siten tak dilaa saktaa he
 The biggest loss of success of this alliance will be to BJP whose vote share is 43
 3 fisadi se girakar 36 fisadi par aa jayega or use mili 73 siten ghatakar 18 rah jaaengi
 It is clear that UP, which brought Modi to power in 2014, can bring bad news for him and the party this time
 survey main ek or mahatvapurn baat saamne aati he
 The SP-BSP and RLD alliance is not going to do much harm to the Congress
 uskaa vot share 7
 It is expected to increase from 5 to 12 per cent, so that it can win 4 seats in 2019 as compared to two seats in 2014
 anya partiyon ke vot share main bhi maamuli giravat hogi
 However, like the last election, he is not going to get any seat from here

 We all know that terrorists are hiding in Pakistan, so why don't we accept it? Why should we make a film on fictitious events? They said, we know that is true, is it a secret? Why can't we say it openly? Aren't there people who are considered dead for Indians and are living in Pakistan
 aap sab sach jaanate hai
 He said, if a wanted terrorist can go to the legal court of a country
 to meraa maananaa he ki yah bahut sharmnaak he
 It is truly a sign of a great country that it considers the petition of a terrorist

 Rajya Sabha member Amar Singh, known for his flamboyant image and his distinct style, today slammed the SP, BSP and Anna hazare-pak but was seen to be giving a cautious response to other parties including Congress and BJP
 note ke badale vot maamle main adaalat se jamaanat milane ke baad pehali baar samvaadadaataaon se rubaru singh ne sapa or basapa se ‘pratikon kii raajnneeti’ karnaa band karne ko kaha

 Singh was spared from making any direct comments on Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh and Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari, who criticized the Anna Hazare side
 unhone kaha, ‘digvijay bade netaa hai or 10 varsh mukhyamantri rahe hai
 Manish Tiwari is also from the elite
 lekin main apni haisiyat jaanata hum isaliye inke bare main koi tippanee nahin karuunga

 Singh said, 'despite the allegations, Advani's Netagiri is not just running, but running
 jab pi ve narsingh raav pradhanmantri the to un par bhi jhamumo maamle main aarope lage the
 However, taking a dig at the Hazare-side, he said that Rajendra Singh, a 'jalpurush' who was a member of Team Anna, has said that Arvind Kejriwal is arrogant
 santosh hegade ne kah chuke hai ki agar team anna raajnneetik hit sadhana chaahati he to vah jariya nahin bananaa chaahate
 He said that Swami Agnivesh has also accused Kejriwal

 unhone kaha ki mamata par har tarah ke aarope lag sakate hai, lekin koi bhi unhen beyimaan nahin kah saktaa
 At the same time, Amar Singh questioned Home Minister p Chidambaram why Prashant Bhushan and Shanti Bhushan are not in jail despite the controversial CD case being corrected by Delhi Police
 singh ne kashmir sambandhi bayaan ke chalate prashanth bhushan par hamalaa hone kii ghatana ko ‘kuch yuvakon kii bhavanaaen’ qaraar diya

 If they can send me to jail then why not sending them
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘chidambaram prashanth bhushan se kyon dar rahe hai
 Singh said that Prashant Bhushan should be prosecuted for his remarks about holding a referendum in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘bhushan par jis tarah hamalaa hua, uske tareeke kii main ninda karata hum lekin mujhe isse ksht nahin hua kyonki bhushan ne bharat ke abhinn hisse kashmir kaa or kargil ke shaheedon kaa apmaan kiya

 However, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance has a combined total of 161 seats

 There are 2,86,471 teachers, 30,000 posts are vacant
 hai skool 6534 hai, isamen 58,572 shikshak hai or 70,000 pad khaali hai
 Obviously, this situation did not happen in a month, for which the government sitting in power for 15 years was also responsible
