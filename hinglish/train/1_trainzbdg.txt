 Check amount of 14 November 2019 ko yojit ek vishesh samaaroh main pradaan kiye jaayenge
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday warned the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, who is warning the Muslim voters of benefiting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the event of their split
 Old examples of friendship have not yet been forgotten, and can Mayawati claim that she will become the bj if circumstances arise after the upcoming election? No government would come up with the Minister
 samajawadi party kii sarkaar ke siem akhilesh yadav ne rajdhani lakhanu main smartphone yojana ke panjiyan ke web portal ke udghaatan ke avasar par kaha, "vah (mayawati) kahati hai ki samaajawaadee party ke logon main bantwaaraa he, lekin muslim bhai jaanate hai ki samaajawaadee party unke kitne kareeb he
 
 
 We are not forgotten yet
 
 
 vah rakshabandhan vaala tyohaar koi nahin bhuulaa he ki kisne kisko raakhi baandhi thi
 
 
 He has not forgotten the things about Gujarat, who had come and sought votes for whom
 
 
 " Akhilesh Yadav challenged, "can Mayawati ji claim that BJP and BSP will not form government together if majority government is not formed tomorrow?" 
 
 uttar pradesh kii janata kaise bharosa karegi
 
 
 ? "he sarcastically said on Mayawati," People are saying they will give cash to the public
 
 
 are, aapkaa to nakadi kaa purana shauk he
 
 
 The people of Uttar Pradesh have not yet forgotten how the CMO and an engineer were killed
 
 
 janmdin ke naam par kahaan vasuuli nahin hoti he
 
 
 You have misled your own people and now you want to mislead the state
 
 
 " Mayawati, in her rally in Lucknow on Sunday, urged Muslim voters to vote in favor of the BSP and said that there has been a split in the Samajwadi Party and they should not waste it by voting for the SP and the Congress, because it Only BJP will benefit
 iske alaava unhone pradesh main agali sarkaar banane par garibon ko nakadi dekar madad kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 Continuing the attack on Mayawati, the Uttar Pradesh CM said that he used to call the BSP chief a 'aunt' but he (mayawati) has trouble calling her a aunt, so he has left her at the request of her as 'aunt'
 uttar pradesh ke punargathan ke mayawati ke bayaan par tikhaa prahaar karte hue mukhyamantri ne kaha, "vah kahati hai ki pradesh bant janaa chahie, kal ko yah bhi kahengi ki desh bahut bada he, desh bhi bant janaa chahie
 We say that those who are talking about dividing the state, for the sake of selfishness, they will also say that divide the country too
 
 
 " Pointing to the incident of the death of two women in a stampede during Mayawati's rally, she said, "their rally is such that one lives
 
 
 apane logon ko ikattha kar diya, bas unhen vahi smarak dikhaa die, vahi sammaan kii baat kar di
 
 
 " akhilesh ne bijepi par bhi kataaksh karte hue kaha, "duusari taraf digital india ke log bhi aa rahe honge
 
 
 When we asked the youth during laptop distribution in Muzaffarnagar, Ghazipur and Bundelkhand, they said that BJP people lie a lot
 
 
 achche din laane kii baat kii thi, lekin ve nahin aae
 
 
 Statistics show that since NITI Aayog was formed, Uttar Pradesh has suffered a loss of Rs 9,000 crore
 
 
 "tippaniyan The Chief Minister of UP claimed that 90 percent people of the state are satisfied with the schemes of the socialists
 agar aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main janata ne kaam ke aadhaar par faisla kiya to samaajawaadee party ek taraf hogi or baaki dal duusari taraf honge
 The SP has not even made its manifesto yet and the opposition parties are nervous about its plans
 unhone kaha ki sapa sarkaar ne kisi bhi varg ko kalyankari yojanaon se vanchit nahin rakhaa
 Millions of youth gained much more from laptops given by the government
 akalan karenge to paaenge ki samaajwaadiyon ne pradesh ko kitna aage badhaayaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that now he will go a step ahead and give smartphones to the eligible people
 isse bahut badi pareshaani dur hogi
 The public will be directly connected to the works and schemes of the government
 samajawadi party kii sarkaar ke siem akhilesh yadav ne rajdhani lakhanu main smartphone yojana ke panjiyan ke web portal ke udghaatan ke avasar par kaha, "vah (mayawati) kahati hai ki samaajawaadee party ke logon main bantwaaraa he, lekin muslim bhai jaanate hai ki samaajawaadee party unke kitne kareeb he

 Chidambaram has said that Pakistan should accept that the arrested terrorist Zabiuddin Ansari alias Abu Jindal had a hand in the 2008 Mumbai attack
 chidambaram ne shuukravaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'pakistan ko sweekaar karnaa chahie ki jindal pakistan gaya tha
 He was part of the group that conspired and trained (ajmal) Kasab and the other nine (terrorists involved in the attack)
 jindal mumbai hamale ke sutaradhaaron or sarganaon main se ek tha
 Chidambaram was replying to a question asked by Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik on the comment that Malik had said that Jindal, the mastermind of the 26 / 11 attack, is an Indian citizen, therefore Pakistan should not be held responsible for his actions
 can
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'main rahamaan malik kii is baat se sahamat hum ki abu jindal ek bhartiya naagarik he, lekin use pakistan main panaah diya gaya
 Pakistan should also accept the truth that it had provided a passport to Jindal
 jindal ke paas se do pahchaan-patr mili hai
 'jindal reached New Delhi on 21 June after being extradited by Saudi Arabia
 use hawaondde par hi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He is accused of allegedly playing a role in carrying out the 26 / 11 attack by 10 Pakistani terrorists
 hamale ke dauraan ek maatr aatankwaadi ajmal kasaab ko jivit giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 He is currently in a jail in Mumbai
 navambar 2008 main hue is bhayanak aatankwaadi hamale main videshi nagarikon sahit 166 log maare gaye the
 The talk is at 11 pm on July 31, 2013
 kuch ghante pehle hi neshnal spot exange (enesiel) ne apane sabhi ek dini forward contract main trading philhal band rakhane kaa faisla liya tha
 About 80 brokers attacked the FT tower in Mumbai, where Financial Technologies (FT) has an office
 ve apat ke sansthaapak or pramotor jignesh shah se milanaa chaahate the
 FT is the holding company of NSEL
 camodity exange kaa kaarobaar band ho jane se brokers ke karodon ru
 They were trapped and they wanted their money back
 lekin unase bachane ke liye jignesh ghar ke pichley daravaaje se khisak liye
 NSEL gets about Rs 5,500 crore from around 13,000 investors
 chukaana he
 It had prepared an eight-month plan to pay back the investors' dues, but still defaulted
 kuch din pehle tak enesiel ne inwestors ke kareeb 300 karod ru
 177 crores out of this
 enesiel ke pramotor financial technology se brij lone ke taur par liye gaye hai
 Jignesh is constantly trying to avoid people and he has not given any answer to our repeated questions
 kabhi mumbai ke kaarobaari samudaay main misaal kii tarah pesh kiye jane vaale shah ne kareeb 15 saal ke bheetar hi bharat or videshon main kareeb nau exange kaa samrajya khadaa kar liya
 But the failure of NSEL has cost his credibility a great deal and will also have an impact on his other businesses
 shah kii chhavi ko tab se batta laganaa shuru hua jab yah pataa chalaa ki enesiel ke brokers ke kai graahakon ne long turm ke forward contract (vaayada saude) main pojishan lee hai jabaki exange ko sirf camodity ke spot contract (hajir saudon) main kaarobaar kii hi ijaajat mili he
 Even more disturbing is that NSEL cleared the forward contract for 25 to 45 days without checking whether the commodity for which the deal was being made was actually deposited in the warehouse
 lekin ek kaarobaari ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya, ''exange hamaare liye ek bank ban gaya tha
 It consists entirely of funding games
 hamen bina bank kii lambii prakriya main uljhe aasaani se puunji mil jaati he
 "the point is also that this fund is not necessarily used for commodity trading only
 sutron kaa aarope he ki enesiel se hasil paise ko logon ne real estate or gold jaise duusare nivesh sadhano main lagaaya
 But due to the slowdown in both gold and real estate, it became difficult to withdraw money from it
 is vajah se difolt kii ghatnaayen badaae lageen
 This is also being confirmed in the investigation of Income Tax Department
 mumbai ke inakam tex vibhaag kii jaanch main kai chaunkaane vaale tathy saamne aae hai
 Explosive is that the spot business of NSEL was just for show and it was using this platform to borrow and lend
 vibhaag ko jaanch main yah pataa chalaa ki jo warehouse raseed exange ke paas jamaa kii gai thim ve farji thim or iske liye koi maal nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 Most of the people believe that the registered warehouse (warehouse) of NSEL does not have enough goods to return the money to the investors, so Shah wants to find some middle ground
 camodity particippents association of india ke president ashok mittal kehete hai, ''yahaan tak ki agar kuch warehouse main maal he bhi, to koi nahin jaanata ki uskaa maalik koun he
 It may be that the goods have been pledged to the bank or any other institution
 ”lekin kaarobaari is baat par jor dete hai ki unako bevajaah nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Mohit Aggarwal, chairman and managing director of Aastha Group, believes that the people of administration are behaving very strictly with businessmen like them
 aasthaa group kii do companiyon aasthaa minmet or jagarant projects ko inwestors ke 250 karod ru
 Have to repay
 agarwal ne kaha, ''main nahin samaj paa rahaa ki hamen ghotalebaajon kii tarah kyon pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 i used to trade in steel and it is lying near the exchange
 ve apana paisa vasuulne ke liye vah steel bech sakate hai
 Did Jignesh Shah know about what was happening in NSEL? It is more likely that they would have been aware of this
 sutron kaa kahana he ki khud jignesh ne vaada saude ke bare main upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay or vaayada bazaar niamak (emmemasi) ke paas prajentation diya tha
 At first everyone was making money and nobody complained
 vitt varsh 2012-13 main enesiel ko 127 karod ru
 It had a net profit of 56 per cent of ft's consolidated profits, compared to just 10 per cent in its last fiscal year
 enesiel kii ghatana apat or jignesh shah ke liye bada jhatka he
 FT has stakes in NSEL and MCX etc
 but FT earns most of its exchange subsidiaries and technology supply to brokers
 exange kaa kaarobaar thap hone kaa matlab he ki uski kamai kaa bada strot suukh jayega
 This will not cause any major loss to the commodity exchange MCX, but it is the same business there too and its trading volume has declined due to the default of payment in NSEL
 apat kii emsiex main 26 fisadi hissedari he
 In 2011-12, it received Rs 107 crore from MCX as dividend and technology support fees
 mili hai
 But Jignesh may get the biggest shock to MCX-SX, the latest exchange in the Indian stock market
 apat group se jude korporate gavarnence ke bade masale isi tarah se saamne aate rahe to koi bhi sansthagat invester is exange par kaarobaar nahin karnaa chahega
 a lawyer for the company said, "there may be criminal action against Jignesh Shah and other directors of the board, but as a company there is no threat to the FT
" yah alag company he or is maamle main paisa vasuulne ke liye sirf enesiel kii sampatti hi jabt kii ja sakati he
 Motilal Oswal, CMD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said, "if they have the intention, they have to assure the investors that they will get their money back
" aaj hamen is group par bilkul bharosa nahin rah gaya he or duusare brokar kii tarah ham bhi apane graahakon ko yahi salaah de rahe hai ki group kii anya companiyon se bhi apana paisa nikaal len
 C, Managing Director of Geojit BNP Pariba Financial Services
 je
 George said, "the brokers were trading with an exchange that has been licensed by the government and is a legal entity
" isliye jimmedaari enesiel kii he ki vah un inwestors ko bhugtan kare, jinka paisa fansaa hua he
 The exchange counter between the buyer and seller is the guarantee party for a business
 ”inakam tex vibhaag kii jaanch se yah chaunkaane vaala tathy bhi saamne aayaa he ki is par khub hangaamaa karne vaale kai bade brokers ko enesiel main ho rahi aniyamittaaon kii pehle se jaankaree thi
 Apart from this, most of the 24 default firms NSEL is talking about are well-to-do companies
 inakam tex vibhaag jaldi hi apni report vitt mantralay ko degaa
 The top 10 out of the 16 brokers associated with NSEL have Rs 3,500 crore of around 1,000 big investors (hnis)
 invest karaayaa he
 But surprisingly, in the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament, both the government and the opposition did not feel the need to discuss the NSEL crisis in detail
 aakhir rajnatik dal is maamle main chuppi kyon saadhe hue hai? maamle kii jaanch ke liye sarkaar ne kuch din pehle hi aarthik maamalon ke sachiv arvind mayaram kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The committee has submitted its report to Mayaram
 sutron ke mutabik isamen videshi mudra kanoon (femaa) ke ulanghan kii ore ishaara he
 Meanwhile, SGS, a Swiss audit firm of nsel-certified 20 warehouses, has presented facts raising investor concern over the audit
 in warehouse main enesiel par hue len-dein main ghoshit maal kaa sirf 15 fisadi hissaa hi paaya gaya he
 2,200 crore in these warehouses, according to sources
 kaa maal hona chahie tha, lekin vahaan sirf 300 karod ru
 Received goods of aakhir kisi camodity ke mulya yaa uski jamaanat kii jaanch kiye bina warehouse raseed kaise jari kar detaa tha? dikhaae gaye or vaastavik maal main itnaa bada antar yah sabit karata he ki baat sirf kuprabandhan kii hi nahin he
 This also raises questions on the role of nsel's own auditor as to why he did not get to know all this before? NSEL auditor Mukesh P
 shah and company ke pramotor mukesh shah kehete hai, ''2012-13 kaa bahi-khaataa to durust tha
 We had investigated 75 per cent of the transactions on NSEL and we did not see any wrong in them
 ”enesiel ne pichley saal apni auditor form esavi ghatalia (arnst and yang global kii sadsy form) ko hataakar mukesh shah and company ko jod liya tha
 According to sources, SV Ghatalia and NSEL had differences over the matching of goods, due to which the auditor firm did not want to sign the books of NSEL
 is bare main hamen ancert and yang ke kisi adhikari kii pratikriya nahin mil pai he
 Another question could not be answered as to how the Settlement Guarantee Fund (SGF) of NSEL mysteriously disappeared after trading stopped
 pehle bataaya ja rahaa tha ki yah fund 800 karod ru
 But it is now just Rs 60 crore
 kaa dikh rahaa he
 Mukesh Shah said, "as of July 2013, SGF was actually Rs 800 crore
 the
 Among these, fixed deposit receipts, investment in mutual funds were correct and were also investigated by banks
 ”jignesh neshnal spot exange kii gadabadi se apni chamadi bachaane kii puri koshish kar rahe hai or iskaa thikra apane management ke sir par phod rahe hai
 NSEL has formally filed a complaint against its former CEO Anjani Sinha and his team with the Economic Offenses Wing (IOW) of Mumbai Police
 board ne aarope lagaaya he ki pehle ke management kii shaayad bhugtan main difolt karne vaali fermon se mileebhagat thi
 The EOW has formed a special investigation team to investigate this
 is jaanch ke baad hi mumbai police exiar darj karegi
 NSEL may also face criminal action
 centre iske adhikariyon ke khilaaf mani landering jaise kai maamle darj kar karrwai karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 If such action is taken, the government can confiscate the personal property of Jignesh as well as the assets of FT and its subsidiaries
 sinha ko fansaakar jignesh khud ko bachaane kii koshish main lage hai
 FT can withdraw its investment from NSEL if the situation becomes very bad
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki apat camodity exange emsiex kii apni 26 fisadi hissedari bhi bech sakati he
 The big question is why is the government taking so long in action? italy main internship ke liye gaye desh ke teen iaiti chaatro ke saath nasleey bhedbhaav kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The three students were waiting for the train at Ventimiglia when local security personnel stopped them on the pretext of checking passports and took them about 110 km away from the city
 teen chaatro main se ek udai kusupati iaiti mumbai or baaki do akshit goyal or deepak bhatta iaiti dilli ke chaatr hai
 These three students have been doing internships at the Inria Sophia Atipolis meditairnicompany since May and were going to Geneva on weekends
 tabhipassportdekhane ke bahaane surakshakarmi unhen vahaan se le gaye
 Unable to contact anyone for 10 hours, the students have written a written complaint about this whole incident in the Indian Embassy and told that they could not get help from anyone for 10 hours
 iske baad unhone kisi tarah apane parijanon se sampark kiya
 Currently they are all in Rome
 to kya isliye hui ghatana
 
 
 When the matter came to light, Italy's Council General Ugo Kierlatani said, "the people of Italy are not racists
" aap dekh sakate hai ki badi sankhya main syria ke log rojaanaa italy aa rahe hai
 This incident must have happened for this reason

 khabar he ki jharkhand kii vartmaan rajyapal draupadi murmu bharat ke raashtrapati pad ke liye NDA gathbandhan kii sambhavit ummidavaar ho sakati he
 In fact, after the Supreme Court ordered the trial of Advani and Joshi in the Babri Masjid case, the possibility of their candidature for this post has almost disappeared
 vahin vainkaya naidu kaa naam bhi aasaani se vipakshi partiyaan ke gale nahin utar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the name of the first tribal governor of the state, Draupadi Murmu, could prove to be a trump card
 jharkhand mukti morcha or bijd kaa mil saktaa he sathvoton ke jodtod main vyast NDA ko daupadi murmu ke naam par kuch vipakshi dalon kaa bhi saath mil saktaa he
 Projecting Daupadi Murmu as the presidential candidate may also get him the support of other parties, including the Jharkhandmukti Morcha
 draupadi murmu kaa sambandh odisha se bhi he
 In such a situation, the NDA may also get the support of the Biju Janata Dal, currently the BJD has 20 mps in the Lok Sabha
 sanyog se draupadi murmu jharkhand or desh kii pehali adivasee mahila rajyapal hai
 By making Draupadi Murmu a candidate, the BJP and the government can give a different message to the country
 vahin vipakshi partiyon ko bhi daupadi murmu kaa virodh karne ke liye kaaphi jaddojahad kerani hogi
 Born on June 20, 1958 in Odisha's tribal family, Draupadi Murmu got a job in Odisha State Secretariat after obtaining her BA degree from Rama Devi Women's College
 1997 main nagar panchayat kaa chunaav jeet kar raajnneeti main padaarpan kiya or pehali baar sthaneey parshad baniin
 If Draupadi Murmu's name comes forward, her journey from Councilor to Presidential candidate will become an ideal and inspiration for all the tribal women of the country
 It is inevitable that in such years of political life, there is no accusation of Draupadi Murmu
 Clean image can be of benefit to NDA

 tata group ne 24 oktober ko sirus mistre ko chairman pad se hataa diya tha
 There were several reasons behind the removal of Mistry from the post of chairman of this group with a market cap of about eight lakh crore rupees
 pehali vajahegrup par pad rahaa tha asartata group ke automobile se lekar retail tak or power plant se software tak, kareeb 100 bijness hai
 Many of these companies are going through difficult times
 is kaaran mistre ko hataane par vichaar hua
 In 2016, nine of the group's 27 listed companies are at a loss
 saat companiyon kii kamai main bhi kami ai he
 The turnover of the Tata group was $ 108 billion in 2014-15, which declined to $ 103 billion in 2015-16
 duusari vajahipane hisaab se companiyon par focustata sans apane group kii non-profit bijness vaali companiyon se dhyaan hataane kii mistre kii soch se naakhush thi
 An example of this is Tata Steel's business in Europe
 ratan tata ko lagata tha ki sirus kaa puraa focus tata kansaltency sarvice yani tisies par he, jabaki ye company pehle hi profit main he or sabase zyada majboot he
 Mistry was focusing on the 'cash cow', deviating from the traditional business
 ye board ko nagavar gujara
 Third reason: Shareholders of Badata Data Motors complained to shareholders in August 2016 that they were given a dividend of only 20 paise per share

 Guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of lakhs of people went to some very special assembly constituencies to create awareness against corruption among people
 lagbhag sabhi badi partiyaan unke chaar din ke kaarykram ko apane paksh main modane main juty raheen, lekin dharmik guru in sabase dur hai
 After abruptly canceling his Amethi tour, Shree Shri told in a special conversation what kind of pressures are put on him
 pra- uttar pradesh yatra kaa uddeshy kya tha or kya aap usamen safal rahe?uttar- uttar pradesh yatra mere liye routine yatra kaa hissaa he or yahaan main pichley kai saal se yatra par aata rahaa hum
 According to the demand of the local people here, i decide the date of arrival here
 mere uttar pradesh daure ke saath kisi bhi tarah kii raajnneeti ko na joda jaae
 The visit was mainly religious
 haa, saath main kuch saamaajik mudde bhi is dauraan uthe, jaisaa ki hamaari kisi bhi anya yatra main hota aayaa he
 Satsangs are always divine forces and it is common with the response of the people
 pra- aapane amethi yatra radd kyon kii? kya iske peeche koi raajnneetik dabaav tha?uttar-asal main raibareli ke log bangalore aae the or unhone satsang kaa kaarykram banaaya tha
 We have many followers here
 ve chaahate the ki raibareli main 1 lakh log juten
 While we were making plans about all this, at the same time we got an invitation from Tikarmafi Ashram in Amethi to attend the centenary celebrations of Swami Harichaitanya
 samay ke abhaav main hamane raibareli ke kaarykram ko chhodkar unheen tarikhon main amethi jane kaa kaarykram banaaya
 As soon as we arrived in Uttar Pradesh, the owner of Amethi told our colleague Swami Paramtejji over the phone here that what kind of pressure he is under
 unhen bahut khed hua or nyotaa waapas lete hue shame bhi mahasoos ho rahi thi
 Even they could not tell us this thing
 main kisi tarah ke vivaad main nahin funsana chahta tha or na hi koi pareshaani khadi karnaa chahta tha, isliye main amethi yatra ko radd karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya or unhone ek kshamaa patr bhi hamen bheja
 Q: Have you had any other such pressures? uttar- main logon ko dabaav jhelane ke gur sikhaata hum, isliye mujhe pataa he ki dabaav se kaise nipta jaataa he
 A
 Anna Hazare has directly told the voters to vote for the Congress
 kya aap bhi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apni muhim main aisa koi kadam uthaane vaale hai?uttar- meraa uddeshy bilkul saaf he
 It is based on moral, anti-corruption, virtue and moral values
 hamane bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apni aawaaj uthaai he or ham swayan karnataka main bhrashtachar ke shikaar hue hai
 Q
 In the election phase, political parties make you their weapon against others
 kya aapane bijepi ke liye koi plan banaaya he
 Answer- i do not like to react to the concepts of others and ignorance of anyone
 har kisi ko apane hisse kii naadaani dikhaane kaa haq he
 But i want to make it clear that if i want to do anything politically, i will do it 100 percent
 agar meri yah bhaavana hui to main sabhi 75 jilon main jaaoongaa or har jagah kam se kam do din bitaauungaa
 i will campaign for the entire three months and give my 100 percent in it
 main itnaa samajhadaar to hum hi ki yah jaan sakuun ki kisi bhi tarah kaa raajnneetik laabh mahaj chaar din kii yatra se nahin mil saktaa
 As far as the Congress is concerned, you should know that my grandfather had participated in the freedom movement and he had been with Mahatma Gandhi for 20 years
 unhone hamaare parivaar kii sari sampatti unhen de di thi
 My mentor was also close to Mahatma Gandhi and had also worked with him for several decades
 iske alaava mere pita pandit nehru ke bade prashansak the, lekin unhone bhi kabhi raajnneeti main hissaa nahin liya
 Any person who raises voice against corruption should not be associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 pra- ek raay aksar nikalakar aati he ki dharmik netaaon ko apane kaaryakshetra ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie or agar ve raajnneeti karnaa hi chaahate hai to unhen chunaav ladanaa chahie
 Answer - Political leaders should not panic by seeing the crowd rising behind religious gurus and any kind of contrary comment can be harmful for them
 pra- team anna par lag rahe bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko aap kis tarah se dekhte hai? kya yah is tarah ke andolan main paardarshita or loktantr ke abhaav ke kaaran he?uttar- is maamle main sarkari agenciyon ko karrwai kerani chahie
 No person is above the law
 koi bhi vyakti jo kanoon ke saath khilwaad karata he, use sajaa milani chahie
 As far as i know, people associated with Team Anna are very committed
 media main kuch aarope lagane bhar se aap unhen bhrasht qaraar nahin de sakate
 They are innocent until nothing is proved against them
 pra- team anna apane liye hi ek samvidhan bana rahi he or ise team main puri tarah se lagu kiya jayega
 Was it necessary? Answer - Disseminating the team is a welcome move and will make decisions more democratic and the team will be able to present civil society more thoroughly
 pra- kya ek sadak par chalaaya jane vaala andolan, jisamen anshan bhi shaamil he, vah sansadeey pranali ko badal saktaa he?uttar- bilkul nahin, sadak kaa andolan so rahe saansadon par ection lene ke liye dabaav daalega
 Q: If called, will you also go to the Bigg Boss house like Swami Agnivesh? Answer - i know only one 'bigg Boss' and i live in his house all the time

 The chair of BCCI Chief n Srinivasan will survive, split or leave
 iskaa faisla ab se kuch ghanton ke baad hi ho jayega
 There is an emergency meeting of the BCCI Working Committee in Chennai at around 2
30 pm
 haalanki is meeting main koi voting nahin hogi lekin mana ja rahaa he ki shrinivasana apana istipha pesh kar sakate hai
 According to the sources, to do this, he has also kept some of his conditions
 pehali shart ke hisaab se maujuuda board sadasyon main se hi kisi ek ko bisisiai kaa adhyaksh banaaya jaae
 The second condition is that Shashank Manohar should not be made the president because Shashank Manohar is considered close to the rival camp ie Sharad Pawar
 teesri shart he ki board main khaali hue do pad sachiv or koshadhyaksh kii niyukti shrinivasana apni pasand se karenge
 Since the gritty of cricket in the IPL and the resignation of several big names from the BCCI, Srinivasan has been under increasing pressure to step down as the chairman
 ab to kuch duusare sadasyon se bhi sanket milane lage hai ki ab bahut hua
 Srinivasan must leave the throne
 haalanki mana ye bhi ja rahaa he ki agar shrinivasana kii sharton ko nahin mana jaataa he to phir wo istipha nahin bhi de sakate hai
 In such a situation, a common formula is coming out after the meeting
 is sthiti main mumkin he ki shrinivasana hi bisisiai ke adhyaksh bane rahenge jabaki shashaank manohar ko board kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh bana diya jaae
 The position of the three-member inquiry committee will also be discussed in the meeting, as one of its members Jagdale has resigned
 darasal, shrinivasana ke damaad gurunath mayppan ko jab se mumbai police ne hiraasat main liya tab se unpar istipha dene kaa dabaav bana
 But Srinivasan did not budge
 yahaan tak ki chidchidakar bisisiai se senior adhikariyon ne bhi pad chhod diya
 But Srinivasan remained adamant
 ipel adhyaksh rajeev shukla ne ravivaar ko hone vaali BCCI varking cameti kii baithak se pehle shanivaar ko pad se istipha de diya
 Srinivasan suffered a setback with Rajiv Shukla's resignation
 isse pehle do padaadhikari sachiv sanjay jagadale or koshadhyaksh ajay shirke pad chhod chuke hai
 What Sanjay Jagdale did was his own decision
 lekin is faisle ne en shrinivasana ko jhakzor diya hoga
 Because Sanjay Jagdale is considered very close to the president Srinivasan
 or ab en shrinivasana chaaron taraf se ghir gaye hai
 Whatever happens now, be it soon, due to which the stains have been put on cricket and the great personalities who control it in India
 wo jald se jald dhul jaaen
 Read related news- Srinivasan will make three demands before resigning; Notice to the government over control of BCCI; Delhi HC gives notice to BCCI on promotion of alcohol; Tihar Jail vs Arthur Road Jail next match of IPL hyderabad main aabkaari vibhaag dwaara pakade gaye drug taskaron ne chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 When the special team scrutinized their phones, the names of many big film personalities were found in it
 mukhya aaropee kelvin kaa tollywood or bollywood ke ek mashhoor film diarector ke saath sambandh paae gaye
 The excise team has called 11 Tollywood film celebrities for questioning
 filmi duniya or nashe kaa sambandh to kaaphi purana he
 But the drug traffickers caught by the special team have revealed a terrible face of this elusive world
 pakade gaye mukhya aaropee kelvin, uske saathi abdul vaahid or abdul kudud ko 2 din kii police remand par liya gaya tha
 During investigation, the team has revealed the names of many famous people from their phones
 aropiyon ke paas se 3 simcard baraamad kiye jinamein lagbhag 1500 number maujuud the
 When the team examined the current numbers, most of the numbers were found from the people of the film world
 usee main ek number mashhoor film diarector kaa mila, jisase kelvin kii aksar phone par lambii baaten hoti thi
 In this investigation, phone records of about 25 film personalities have been extracted
 jaanch ke dauraan paaya gaya ki deal sirf kol ke jariye hi nahin whatsap par bhi kii jaati thi
 In this, Shiva, Jane and Sunshine were his codewords
 pichley kaaphi samay se aaropee 'alesady' jacedrugsin logon ko supplai kar rahe the
 They were busted by the Excise team on 4 July last
 is maamle main 12 taskaron kii giraftaar kii gai thi
 The inquiry continues
 vishaal bharadwaj kii film ‘dedh ishkia’ main maadhuri dikshit ke saath najar aane ja rahe abhinayta nasiruddin shah ne kaha ki vah dhak dhak girl ke ‘prashasank’ hai tathaa phir unke saath kaam karne ko icchhuk hai
 'dedh Ishqiya' is the sequel to the 2010 film Ishqiya
 ishkia main vidya balaan, nasiruddin shah or arshad varsi najar aae the
 Naseeruddin and Arshad will remain in this new film, but Madhuri will be seen in place of Vidya
 tippaniyan It is not that Madhuri and Naseeruddin will be seen together on the golden screen for the first time
 isse pehle donon rajeev raay kii ‘tridev’ , pankaj parashar kii ‘rajkumaar’ tathaa em epa hossain kii ‘gajagamini ’ main kaam kar chuke hai
 Naseeruddin said on the occasion of an event, "madhuri and i have worked before and i admire her
" main nahin jaanata ki meri kitni filmein unhone dekhi hai lekin main hameshaa sochataa hum ki vah ek acchhee abhinetri hai or mujhe phir unke saath kaam karne kaa intjaar he
 '' ‘dedh ishkia varsh 2010 main ai film ishkia kii agali kadi he
 Vidya Balan, Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi were seen in Ishqiya
 is nai film main nasiruddin or arshad to rahenge hi lekin vidya ke sthaan par maadhuri najar aaengi
 The comments aisa nahin he ki maadhuri or nasiruddin pehali baar sunahare parde par ek saath najar aaenge
 Prior to this, both have worked in Rajiv Rai's 'tridev', Pankaj Parashar's 'rajkumar' and MF Hussain's 'gajgamini'
 nasiruddin ne ek kaarykram ke avasar par kaha, ‘‘maadhuri or main pehle bhi kaam kar chuke hai or main unka prashasank hum
 i don't know how many of his films he has seen but i always think that she is a good actress and i look forward to working with her again
 ’’ It is not that Madhuri and Naseeruddin will be seen together on the golden screen for the first time
 isse pehle donon rajeev raay kii ‘tridev’ , pankaj parashar kii ‘rajkumaar’ tathaa em epa hossain kii ‘gajagamini ’ main kaam kar chuke hai
 Naseeruddin said on the occasion of an event, "madhuri and i have worked before and i admire her

 ’’ The Triple Talaq bill stuck in the Rajya Sabha for a long time passed on Tuesday
 rajyasabha main is bill ke samarthan main 99 to virodh main 84 sadasyon ne voting kii
 In passing this bill, many regional parties have also played a big role by not participating in voting
 in partiyon dwaara voting main hissaa na lene kii vajah se bahumat kaa aankada kam ho gaya or piem modi is bill ko upree sadan paas kara gaye
 The attitude of the mps of Jammu and Kashmir's party PDP regarding the Triple Talaq Bill was also astonishing
 darasal, pidipi ke do saansadon ne upree sadan main bill pesh hone ke baad voting main hissaa nahin liya
 Because of this, the majority figure further reduced
 or modi sarkaar is bill ko paas karaane main safal rahi
 Let me tell you that PDP Party President Mehbooba Mufti said before the bill was introduced in the House that she would not support the government in any way with this bill
 lekin unki party ke do saansadon dwaara voting main hissaa na lene se apratyaksh taur par phayda modi sarkaar ko hi hua
 Let me tell you that Mehbooba Mufti had said a few days ago about the triple talaq bill that the Modi government is trying to enter into our (muslim) homes with the help of this bill
 unhone teen talaak bill ko lekar ek twit bhi kiya
 He wrote that i do not understand why the Modi government is adamant on getting this bill passed, especially when the Supreme Court has declared it illegal
 aisa karnaa sirf musalamaanon ko dand dene ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation when the condition of the country's economy is going so bad, should it be such an important issue for the government? Fail to understand the need to pass the triple talaq bill especially since the Supreme Court had already declared it illegal
 Undue interference seemingly to punish Muslims
 Given the current state of the economy, should this really have been a priority? The triple talaq bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha amid stiff opposition from the opposition and the demand to send the bill to the Select Committee
 isse pehle vipaksh kii bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang bhi sadan main gir gai
 During the voting, 84 votes in favor of sending the bill to the Select Committee, while 100 votes were cast in the protest
 ab is bill ko sweekruti ke liye raashtrapati ke paas bheja jayega
 Passing the triple talaq bill from the Rajya Sabha is considered a major victory of the Modi government
 bill paas hone ke baad kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki aaj ek aitihaasik din he
 Both houses have given justice to Muslim women
 yah ek unnatisheel bharat kii shuruyaat thi
 The magic figure of 114 needed by Shiv Sena 94 and BJP 82 for councilor majority is on the verge of breakdown of alliance between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena
 aise main maharashtra main sarkaar gathan ko lekar asamanjas ke bich ab brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika (biemasi) par sankat ke badal mandara sakate hai
 The Shiv Sena will need the support of the Congress to retain the BMC
 agar congress ne shivasena ko sarkaar ke saath biemasi main bhi saport kar diya to abhi tak biemasi kii satta main hissedaar rahi bijepi, vidhansabha ke saath biemasi main bhi vipaksh main chali jaaegi
 If we look at the figures, in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation with 227 councilors, Shiv Sena has 94 councilors and BJP has 82 councilors
 donon ne milakar biemasi kii satta hasil kii thi
 If the BJP is separated from the Shiv Sena, it will also lose the magical figure of 114
 aise main use 36 parshadon vaali congress-ensipi ke saport kii jarurat padegi
 The BMC elections were fought against each other, the Shiv Sena and the BJP came face to face during the election of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation
 iske baad donon ne ek-duusare ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa
 In this election, the BJP performed brilliantly, winning 82 seats, while in the 2012 elections it won just 31 seats
 shivasena ko bijepi se mahaj do zyada seat yani 84 siten mili thim
 After this, 6 and three independent councilors of MNS were joined in Shiv Sena
 iske alaava ek or parshad shivasena ke paale main aa gaya tha
 BJP had claimed the chair of BMC, after BMC elections, Shiv Sena and BJP once again came together
 is dauraan biemasi kii kursi par bijepi ne apana daawa kiya
 He said that we deserve it
 shivasena ne iskaa virodh kiya
 After this the BMC chair went to Shiv Sena account after consensus of both parties
 shivasena ke vishwanath mahadeshwar bane meirshivsena ne vishwanath mahadeshwar ko biemasi kaa meyar banaaya, jabaki hemangi varlikar ko dipti meyar banaaya gaya

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke netaa ram madhav ko unke sanghathan ne ab bhaajapa main kaam karne ke liye bheja he or party adhyaksh unki nai bhoomika tay karenge
 According to sources, another Sangh leader Shiv Prakash has also been appointed to the Sangh's work in the party and both of them will be given a prominent place in the BJP
 sarkaar gathan ke baad grahamantri banaae gaye, rajnath singh kii jagah jald hi bhaajapa kaa nayaa adhyaksh bhi niyukt hone vaala he
 Ram Madhav confirmed the development saying that he will join BJP and is waiting for his new role in the party
 bhaajapa kii vichaardhaaratmak paramarshdaata ke rup main maane jane vaala sangh samay samay par party main apane netaaon ko bhejtaa he
 These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a full-time pracharak of the Sangh
 party ke netaa is nae ghatnakram par chuppi saadhe hue hai, lekin sutron ke anusaar in donon main se ek ko bhaajapa mahasachiv banaaya ja saktaa he
 BJP is going to get a new president soon and there is a possibility that general secretary Amit Shah may get this post
 party main baari pherbadal hone vaale hai, kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main mili jeet ke baad uske bahut se netaa sarkaar main shaamil ho gaye hai
 The differences between eminent nuclear scientist Anil Kakodkar and Smriti Irani have now come to the fore
 anil kakodakar ne iaiti diarectors chayan par sawaal uthaate hue kaha he ki chayan prakriya ke dauraan mahaj aupchaarikta puri kii gai
 He further said that completing such formality in a big institute like IIT is not good for the country, a lot of thoughtful decision has to be taken during selection
 kakodakar kaa maananaa he ki ek din main 36 ummidavaaron kaa intervyuu karnaa sahi nahin he, aisa karnaa chayan prakriya main baadha utpann karata he, jisase sahi ummidavaar kaa chayan nahin ho saktaa he
 Actually, Kakodkar resigned from the post of Chairman of the Board of Governance of Bombay IIT on March 12 after disagreeing with the directors selection process of IIT Ropar, Patna and Bhubaneswar
 magar smriti irani se baatcheet ke baad ve kaarykaal tak pad par bane rahane ko raji ho gaye hai
 Despite not holding the post till his term, he did not participate in the search-cum-selection meeting held on Sunday, the same panel shortlisted 12 candidates for IIT directors, which were later dropped
 meeting main naa jane ke bare main unhone kaha he ki iit-bombai board of governors kii meeting khatm ho chuki he, or isi kaaran main vahaan nahin gaya
 If they wanted me to continue in the post, then i am in the post because i am a responsible man
 unase jab yah poocha gaya ki aap diarectors chayan prakriya ke liye kisi meeting main shaamil honge to unhone kaha ki yah process khatm ho chukaa he
 After meeting 2 relatives of the victims of the Sonbhadra massacre at Chunar Guest House in Mirzapur, Priyanka Gandhi has said that her motive has been fulfilled

 India's young and inexperienced bowlers performed well in the last two matches and played a key role in laying the foundation for victory

 The pressure will certainly be on the England team who will have to put up an inspiring performance to prevent the Indians from winning the series at PCA Stadium
 donon tiimon ke liye yah match bahut mahatvapurn he or isliye muqabla romaanchak hone kii sambhaavna he
 Despite two big wins, there are some departments which are a matter of concern for Indians
 inamen salaami jodi kaa nahin chal paanaa bhi shaamil he
 Although Gautam Gambhir is making a good start, he has failed to convert it into a big innings
 duusare salaami ballebaaj ajinkya rahane bhi lay main nahin dikh rahe hai or score nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Due to this, India has not yet got a good start in the series (except for the first ODI)
 bhartiya team prabandhan sambhavat: pichley do maichon main jeet darj karne vaali team main kisi tarah kaa badlaav nahin karegaa
 Ravinder Jadeja had a great performance with bat and ball in the last two matches which made a difference
 bharatiyon ko team main santulan paidaa karne ke liye adad alrounder kii sakht jarurat he or jadeja ne is sthaan ko acchhee tarah se bharaa he
 However, the young Saurashtra all-rounder will have to perform consistently well
 jadeja kii farm se captain dhoni bhi khush hai kyonki ekadivasiy maichon ke vartmaan niyamon yuvaraj singh or suresh raina jaise parttime gendbaajon se adhik over nahin karaaye ja sakate hai
 Dhoni said, 'he (jadeja) definitely gives us balance
 is lihaaj se jadeja hamaare paas sahi khilaadi he
 We were struggling with the bowling all-rounder
 hamaare paas irfan (pathan) hi akelaa aisa khilaadi tha
 "he said," Before the new rules we used to get Yuvraj Singh and other parttime bowlers ten overs
 naye niyam aane ke baad yuvi ko gendbaaj ke taur par unase saamanjasy bithaane main thodaa samay lagegaa
 Virat Kohli's return to form is good news for Indians as the continuous failure of the middle order in the recent tournament was heavy on the Indians
 yuvaraj ne pichley match main choti pari kheli lekin vah behatar tach main dikh rahe the lekin unase badi pari kii darkaar he

 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin did well in Ranchi
 duusari taraf england kii kai chintaaen hai kyonki unka ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon vibhaag apekshaaon par khara nahin utar paaya he
 The way Alastair Cook dominated the Indian bowlers in the Test series, he has not been able to perform so far in the ODI series
 khatarnaak kevin petersan bhi jalawaa nahin dikhaa paye hai
 It is another matter that fate was not with him in Ranchi as he was given a wrong out
 england ke ballebaajon ko bhartiya spinneron ko khilne ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the last two matches, Bhuvneshwar and Ahmed gave a shock to the English team initially so that their team could not recover till the end
 england ke captain ne kaha, ‘hamen khuli soch ke saath maidan par utarana hoga
 We could not score the last two matches

 If you are crazy about the tunes of Bollywood movies, then you will know that there are many songs whose music is stolen

 ' Munna Bajrangi, who was once synonymous with terror in Uttar Pradesh, was shot dead on Monday morning in Baghpat Jail by firing
 jail ke andar munna bajrangi ko 8 se 10 goli maarane kaa makasad saaf tha, na sirf munna ko har haal main maarna balki dehshat bhi kaayam karnaa
 However, Munna himself was once another name for panic
 lekin 2005 main gajipur ke vidhayak krishnanand raay par tabadatod 400 goliyaan barasaane vaala munna bajrangi ek aisa naam tha, jo kabhi uttar pradesh or bihar main bahubaliyon kii takat banakar ubhara tha
 Munna, who escaped after the murder of Krishnanand Rai, was arrested from Mumbai in 2009 after two years of hard work
 lekin kam hi log jaanate honge ki kai rajyon kii police kii naam main dam kar rakhane vaala or logon main dehshat failaane vaala munna bajrangi aparaadh kii duniya main 250 rupee kaa tamancha lekar ghusaa tha
 Pistolmunna Bajrangi, who bought a 250 rupees at the age of 14, had committed the first murder by purchasing a pistol of Rs 250 at the age of 14 and thus her entry into the world of crime
 1965 main kisaan parivaar main janme prem prakaash ko kisaani main man nahin laga to vah kaaleen kaa kaam sikhane laga
 He was married at the age of 14 by family members
 shaadi ke 4-5 din baad hi paise ko lekar prem prakaash urf munna bajrangi ke chachaa kaa gaanv ke hi ek shaks bhullan singh se vivaad ho gaya
 Bhullan abused Bajrangi's uncle who pierced Bajrangi
 bas usne 250 rupaye main pistal kharidi or sidhaa pahunch gaya bhullane ke yahaan
 Munna Bajrangi fired on Bhullan with that 250-rupee pistol
 bhullan maaraa gaya or munna bajrangi kaa jaraayam kii duniya main daakhila ho gaya
 After entering the world of Jarayam, Prem Prakash himself took his name as Munna Bajrangi
 bas yahaan se munna bajrangi ne tabadatod vaardaaton ko anjaam dena shuru kiya or aisa koharaam machaaya ki log iske naam se dehshat khaane lage
 Munnamunna Bajrangi was a special shooter of Mukhtar Ansari's gang, although he had entered the world of crime at the age of 14, but the real entry into the world of crime started after fighting with mafia don Mukhtar Ansari
 bajrangi se mukhtaar kii pahchaan uske dost anil singh or kalam, jisaki bivi raabia vidhayak rah chuki thi, in donon ne karwaai thi
 At the behest of Mukhtar, Bajrangi committed several murders
 ek baar bajrangi ko goli lagi, us vakt mukhtaar ne hi uski jaan bachaai
 Then both of them became stronger
 mukhtaar ke kehane par munna bajrangi ne pehali baar siyaasi murder kiya kailash dube kaa, jo blaak pramukh or bijepi kaa netaa tha
 During this time, Mukhtar became a white-collar from Don and his entry into politics as an MLA
 phir to munna bajrangi ko siyaasi sangrakshan bhi milane laga
 Prem, Shaadi and Encounter In 1998, Munna Bajrangi met Seema Singh at her friends' house, which later turned into love
 donon ne haridwar main police kii najar bachaakar shaadi kar lee
 But in the same year, UP STF surrounded Munna Bajrangi
 munna bajrangi ko police kii kai goliyaan lageen
 The UP police even claimed that Munna Bajrangi was killed
 police jab aspataal lekar gai to bajrangi ne ankhen khol deen or is tarah uski jaan bachi, encounter ke kuch din baad uski beti hui
 Bajrangi remained in Tihar Jail till the year 2002, and after his release from prison, with the help of Mukhtar, made his base in Mumbai
 BJP vidhayak kii hatyamukhtaar se farmaan mil jane ke baad munna bajrangi ne bhaajapa vidhayak krishnanand raay ko khatm karne kii sajeesh rachi
 And because of that, on 29 November 2005, at the behest of mafia don Mukhtar Ansari, Munna Bajrangi put Krishnanand Rai to sleep in broad daylight
 usne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar lakhanu hive par krishnanand raay kii do gadiyon parddakh47 se 400 goliyaan barasaithi
 Apart from MLA Krishnanand Rai from Ghazipur, 6 other people running with him were also killed in this attack
 postmortem ke dauraan har mritak ke sharir se 60 se 100 tak goliyaan baraamad huin thi
 This massacre created a stir in the political circles of the province
 har koi munna bajrangi ke naam se khauf khaane laga
 He became the most wanted after committing the murder
 munna ke sir par tha lakhon kaa inaambhajapa vidhayak kii hatya ke alaava kai maamalon main uttar pradesh police, estf or sibiai ko munna bajrangi kii talash thi
 Therefore a reward of seven lakh rupees was also declared on him
 us par hatya, apharan or vasuuli ke kai maamalon main shaamil hone ke aarope he
 He kept changing his location continuously
 police kaa dabaav bhi badhata ja rahaa tha
 Panahup Police and STF were constantly searching for Munna Bajrangi in Mumbai
 uskaa upi or bihar main rah paanaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Delhi too was not safe for him
 isliye munna bhagkar mumbai chalaa gaya
 He spent a long time there
 is dauraan uskaa kai baar videsh janaa bhi hota rahaa
 His relationships with the people of the underworld were also becoming stronger
 vah mumbai se hi phone par apane logon ko disha nirdesh de rahaa tha
 Luck also tried in politics Once Munna tried to contest in the Lok Sabha elections from Ghazipur Lok Sabha seat
 munna bajrangi ek mahila ko gajipur se bhaajapa kaa tikat dilwane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Due to which his relations with Mukhtar Ansari were also deteriorating
 yahi vajah thi ki mukhtaar uske logon kii madad bhi nahin kar rahe the
 After being disappointed with the BJP, Munna Bajrangi joined the Congress
 vah congress ke ek kaddavar netaa kii sharan main chalaa gaya
 The Congress leaders were also residents of Jaunpur district
 magar mumbai main rah kar siyasat karte the
 Munna Bajrangi also supported Netaji in the Maharashtra assembly elections
 aise giraftaar hua tha munnautar pradesh samate kai rajyon main munna bajrangi ke khilaaf mukademe darj the
 He had become a problem for the police
 uske khilaaf sabase zyada maamle uttar pradesh main darj hai
 But on 29 October 2009, Munna was dramatically arrested by Delhi Police in Malad area of mumbai
 mana jaataa he ki munna ko apane encounter kaa dar sata rahaa tha
 So he got himself arrested by Delhi Police under a scheme
 munna kii giraftaar ke is oparation main mumbai police ko bhi ain vakt par shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The Delhi Police later said that Munna Bajrangi is suspected to have been involved in the murder of Delhi's controversial encounter specialist Rajbir Singh
 isliye use giraftaar kiya gaya
 Since then, he is being kept in different jails
 is dauraan uske jail se logon ko dhamkaane, vasuuli karne jaise maamle bhi saamne aate rahe hai
 Munna Bajrangi claims to have committed 40 murders in his 20-year criminal life
 250 kii pistal se 250 karod kaa samrajya250 kii pistaul se hatya kar jurm kii duniya main kadam banane vaale munna bajrangi ne 250 karod kaa samrajya khadaa kar liya tha
 The death of Munna Bajrangi, fond of possessing weapons like AK-47, will also sink his property worth several hundred crores
 darasal aparaadh se bajrangi ne khub kamai kii lekin paisa netaaon police afasaron ke jariye hi invest kiya
 Munna Bajrangi not only used to contract contracts for PWD, road and railways with Mukhtar, but had also set foot in this business alone
 upi mumbai jharkhand main uski kai praparty hai
 
 
 But in oblivion

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 manohar laal khatter haryana ke nae or dasven mukhyamantri honge
 After the demise of Bhupendra Singh Hooda, the people of Rohtak need not be discouraged as Baniyani, the ancestral village of Khattar Saheb is in Rohtak itself
 khatter ne rajyapal se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar diya he or 26 aktubar ko shapath grahan hoga
 a non-jat leader becomes chief minister in Haryana after two decades
 isi ke saath daud main shaamil baaki dhaavak ab mantri banane kii res main daudenge
 Manohar Lal Khattar may be from Rohtak but was elected from the city of Karnal
 haalanki baniyaani gaanv main jashn kaa maahaul he
 Diwali is also celebrated in Karnal
 apane lambey raajnneetik jivan main pehali baar chunaav ladaa or haryana main sabase adhik maton se jite bhi
 He is the fourth non-jat leader to become the Chief Minister of Haryana
 unase pehle bhagavat dayaal sharma, bhajanlaal or banarsi das gupt bhi haryana main gair jat mukhyamantri rahe hai
 The 60-year-old Khattar left his village at the age of 17 and started working at his brother's shop in Delhi's Chandni Chowk
 aage chalakar aresas se jude or purnakalik prachaarak ban gaye
 He is unmarried and has also taught tuition
 200 gaj kaa ek makaan he or chah lakh bees hazaar kaa karj he
 This is their total asset
 parivaar main paanch bhai hai or do bahane lekin sabase bade hai manohar laal khatter
 Khattar is said to have rode Modi on a bike like Shankar Singh Vaghela of Gujarat during his days of struggle
 bijepi main lagata he ki sholay vaale jai viru kii kahani chal rahi he
 Shankar Singh Vaghela is not sorry
 1996 main jab modi haryana ke prabharee the tab khatter ne unke saath kaam kiya he
 He was called by Modi to see the arrangements for the election of Kutch in the elections held after the earthquake in Gujarat
 varanasi main jab modi chunaav lard rahe the tab khatter ne varanasi ke 50 ward kaa jimmaa sambhala tha
 He joined the Sangh in 1980 and later with the BJP
 chavalis saal ke gumnaam raajnneetik sangharsh ke baad ve mukhyamantri pad par pahunche hai
 Therefore, keep in mind the four decades of Khattar Saheb's fate
 khatter sahab ke kuch lokapriy bayaan bhi hai jaise azaadi kii bhi seemaa hoti hai
 The girls will not see if they dress properly
 bhartiya samskruti ke lihaaz se khap ke kuch faisle thik hai
 Politics shows amazing miracles
 om prakaash chautaala ne jind main taaoo devilal kii jayanti se apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii thi, lekin is abhiyaan kaa ant bhi taaoo devilal ke naam par bane stadium se hi hoga
 When Manohar Lal Khattar will take oath at Devilal Stadium in Panchkula on 26 October
 maharashtra main mukhyamantri kaa naam tay nahin hua he
 Devendra Fadnavis is leading in the race but his race is not yet complete
 kabhi unke saath koi or daudane lagata he to kabhi koi or
 Fadnavis was running ahead in this race of eight hundred meters, but now it seems that there is someone else who is running ahead
 ab samaj aayaa ki kyon nitin gadakari nattejey aane ke din se hi khud ko dilli ke liye upyukt bataa rahe the
 His name started running fast on Tuesday afternoon
 ve nagpur pahunche to hawaii adde par solah vidhayak swaagat main aa gaye
 When he reached home, twenty two twenty-two mlas reached and asked Gadkari to accept the responsibility of the Chief Minister
 maharashtra chunaav main gadakari ne sau se bhi zyada reliyaan kii hai
 Akhilesh Sharma's report says that Gadkari wants to run the name of former state president and OBC leader Sudhir Mungantiwar further, but it seems that Sudhir Mungantiwar considers Gadkari as his leader
 unhone bhi bayaan de diya ki gadakari ji raashtra ke saath-saath maharashtra kii chintaa karen or mukhyamantri bane
 Arun Jaitley has asked Barkha Dutt on the Chief Minister's question that those who are front runners are the front runners
 kahin iskaa matlab to nahin ki jo res main daud rahe hai wo daudte hi rah jaaenge or koi or aage nikal jayega
 On the other hand, the demolished Shiv Sena has become more soft and has agreed to accept the BJP
 isse pehle congress kii tarah shivasena ne bhi ensipi ke automatic samarthak kii ninda kii he
 The Shiv Sena, which has targeted someone or the other daily in the newspaper Saamana, has today named this effort of NCP as Vanarcheshta
 kakacheshtaa kii mujhe jaankaree thi lekin vanaracheshtaa aaj suna he
 It may be that this attempt is also old and mythical
 saamana kaa sampadakeey likhata he ki chunaav se pehle pavaar ke liye bijepi half chaddhi party thi
 The NCP wants to come to power to hide its sins
 pavaar kaa secularvaad jhootha he
 The PM called the NCP a naturally corrupt party
 janata ne ensipi congress ko puri tarah se nakaar diya he
 Such people will come to power and pollute the Ganges of development
 hamaari koshish he ki vikaas kii ganga apavitra na ho
 Somewhere, the Shiv Sena does not want to say that the NCP should not try because it is going to upset its efforts
 jo log bijepi ko jitate dekh is party main shaamil hone kaa man bana rahe hai, wo pehle se samaj len ki kaam bahut karnaa hoga
 The celebration has not begun yet that the BJP has announced the in-charge of the states and given them a new job
 maharashtra ke prabharee rajeev pratap rudi ko ab andhra pradesh or tamilnadu kaa jimmaa diya gaya he or unki jagah jepi nadda maharashtra kaa jimmaa sanbhaalenge
 Well now let's move to the other news
 kuch bhi kahiye diwali agar mani he to surat main
 In the face of this Diwali, two of the bjp's bankruptcy fail
 is stadium main aap sainkadon kaaron kii tasviren dekh rahe hai
 There are a total of 491 cars that have been given as Diwali gifts to the best employees of Hari Krishna Export
 525 karmchaariyon ko saadhe teen lakh ke aabhushan die gaye
 And a 200-room flat was given to 200 employees who did not have a home
 ise dekhakar aap apni apni compinyon ko lekar udhaas na hon
 Savjibhai Dholakia, chairman of Harikrishna Export, has done wonders
 1200 karmchaariyon ko aise tohfe de die ki ab kisi ko glass set, mithai or kaashew baadaam vaali diwali gift thik hi nahin lag rahi he
 The news of this news is also discussed on the media's social brother

 On the basis of these employees, the company has exported one billion dollars this year
 zarur isse zyada niryaat karne vaali kai companiyaan hai, magar saavji bhai jaisaa koi prakaash main nahin aayaa he
 Some employees in companies do get bonuses, but giving flats to two hundred employees is not a thing
 vaise khabaron ke mutabik kendriya mantri smriti irani ne bhi amethi main koi 12 hazaar saadiyaan bantwain hai
 But where are these saris in front of cars and houses
 chaliye ye bhi thik hi he
 i liked one thing about Savjibhai Dholakia and can pierce someone else
 dholkia sahab ne press se kaha ki mere karmchaariyon ne kaaphi mehnat kii he
 i cannot keep all the profits myself
 mujhe inaam to dena hi tha
 By the way, last year, he gave car gifts to hundred employees
 savjibhai aaj hamaare saath hai

 Kamal Kumar, a state-level player in boxing, has won many medals, but being fed by poverty, he is now doing garbage work
 kanpur ke gualtoli ilaake main vah rickshaw par ghar-ghar jaakar kooda uthaate hai or bache hue samay main paan kii dukaan lagaate hai
 By the way, Kamal is an example for young people, who give up on minor tasks after graduation
 unke anusaar, koi kaam chota nahin hota
 Significantly, Kamal, who is fond of boxing since childhood, won the gold medal in the district level competition in 1991 with hard work and represented the bronze medal in UP Olympics in 1993 and Uttar Pradesh in the Junior National Championship Ahmedabad in the same year
 iske baad 2004 main jilastareey pratiyogita main rajat or 2006 ke rajya khelon main kaansya padak jeeta
 Despite all these achievements, the boxer of the state needed a unique job to feed his family, but the government paid no attention to this player
 aakhirkaar use kooda uthaane kaa kaam karnaa padaa
 The comments camel ko tatkaaleen rajyapal motilal vora or rajya khelon main purv mantri calraj mishra ne kaansya padak se sammanit kiya tha, lekin garibi ke chalate khel peeche chhot gaya or kahin sarkari naukari bhi na mili
 After this, when the family came to terms with starvation, Kamal hung all the medals in the house and the bachelor's degree was also held
 vaise, aaj camel ke teen bete hai or unamem se do bete camel ke padchinhon par chalate hue boxing sikh rahe hai
 Kamal's dream is to make his children a good boxer so that the children can illuminate the name of the country
 camel kaa doosraa betaa aditya dhanraj kaksha aath kaa chaatr he or neshnal boxing khel chukaa he
 The son says he wants to fulfill the father's dreams
 vaise, camel aise naujavaanon ke liye misaal hai, jo snaatak ki padhai ke baad mili chote-mote kaamon ko chhod dete hai
 According to him, no work is small
 gauratlab he ki bachapan se hi boxing kaa shauk rakhane vaale camel ne puri mehnat se kiye abhyaas se 1991 main jilastareey pratiyogita main swarna padak jeeta or 1993 main upi olympic main kaansya padak or usee saal junior neshnal championships ahmedabad main uttar pradesh kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 This was followed by a silver in the district level competition in 2004 and a bronze medal in the 2006 state games
 in sabhi uplabdhiyon ke baad bhi soobe ke is boxr ko apane parivaar kaa pet paalane ke liye ek adad naukari kii darkaar thi, lekin sarkaar ne is khilaadi kii taraf koi dhyaan nahin diya
 Eventually he had to do the work of garbage
 tippaniyan Kamal was awarded the bronze medal by the then Governor Motilal Vora and former Minister in State Games Kalraj Mishra, but due to poverty, the game was left behind and no government job was found
 iske baad jab parivaar par bhukhe marane kii naubat ai to camel ne saare medal ghar main taang die or snaatak kii degree bhi dhari kii dhari rah gai
 By the way, today Kamal has three sons and two of them are learning boxing while following in the footsteps of Kamal
 camel kaa sapana he ki vah apane bacchon ko acha boxr banaae taaki bachche desh kaa naam roshan kar saken
 Kamal's second son Aditya Dhanraj is a student of class eight and has played National Boxing
 bete kaa kahana he ki vah pita ke sapanom ko puraa karnaa chahta he
 Significantly, Kamal, who is fond of boxing since childhood, won the gold medal in the district level competition in 1991 with hard work and represented the bronze medal in UP Olympics in 1993 and Uttar Pradesh in the Junior National Championship Ahmedabad in the same year

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle told reporters, this decision was taken after careful deliberation

 unhen nishpaksh jaanch kaa mauka bhi nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The comments videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki videsh mantri sushamaa ne 27 april ko pakistan ke videsh maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ko ek khat likhakar anurodh kiya tha ki jadhav ke parivaar ko vija diya jaae, lekin unke parivaar ko abhi tak vija nahin diya gaya

 ) videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, yah nirnay saavdhaneepurvak vichaar-vimarsh karke liya gaya tha
 On going to the ICJ on the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav, a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs said that India requested 16 times for High Commission contact (counselor access), but it was refused

 devilliars ne 41 ball par 89 ranon kii dhuandhar pari kheli or vijayi chaukaa jad captain viraat kohli ke chehre kii chamak lautaa di
 RCB registered a stunning four-wicket victory on the verge of sunrisers flying in the storm of de Villiers
 hyderabad ke 156 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha karte hue aaarasibi kii team ek samay 15wein over main 95 ran par paanch wicket ganvaane ke baad sankat main thi, lekin devilliars ne mishael stark (05) ke saath chathe wicket ke liye sirf 4
 a partnership of 57 runs in 4 overs gave his team the victory
 apni pari ke dauraan devilliars ne 8 chakke or 6 chauke jade or ek gend shesh rahete hi team ko jeet dilaai
 The sharp bowling of Karan Sharma (3 for 17) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2 for 16) could not save the Hyderabad team from defeat
 utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa match
 
 
 Hyderabad had earlier scored 155 for six with the help of David Warner (61) half-century
 aaarasibi kii chah maichon main yah teesri jeet he, jabaki hyderabad kii team ko chah maichon main chauthi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 RCB started off badly after chasing the target, losing opener Parthiv Patel (03) and captain Virat Kohli (00) in the second over itself
 parthiv ne bhubaneshwar kii gend ko viketon par khelaa jabaki kohli ne wicketiper naman ojha ko kaich thamaya jisase aaarasibi kaa score do wicket par chah ran ho gaya
 Chris Gayle played some powerful shots, but opener Chris Gayle had no effect on the double stroke
 unhone del sten par do chowk jadne ke baad ishanth sharma kii lagaataar gendon par chaukaa or do chakke maare
 Amidst the storm of Gayle, Shikhar Dhawan held the ball to Karan and this leg-spinner, not disappointing his captain, got Gayle caught by Darren Sammy at deep mid-wicket
 gail ne 19 gendon par 27 ran banaae
 Karan then gave a fourth blow to RCB by lbw out Riley Rosou (14), who is making his IPL debut

 Yuvraj Singh (14) also hit a six over Karan but became the third victim of this leg-spinner in the same over
 aaarasibi ko antim paanch over main jeet ke liye 59 ran kii darkaar thi
 De Villiers targeted Sammy in the 16th over, scoring 19 runs on him with two sixes and a four and during this time he completed a half-century in just 23 balls
 devilliars ne bhubaneshwar ke over main bhi do chauke jadkar apni team ko behatar sthiti main pahunchaaya
 De Villiers 'kamal' team in Stan's over required 28 runs in the last two overs
 aise main divilliars ne 19wein over main sten par teen chakke or ek chauke se 24 ran jutakar apni team ko jeet kii dahalij tak pahunchaa diya
 He ensured Bangalore's victory by hitting a four over Pathan
 hyderabad kii pari
 
 
 Earlier for Hyderabad, Warner smashed a 61-run knock off 49 balls with four fours and three sixes before returning to the pavilion in the final over of the innings
 unhone captain shikhar dhawan (37) ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 62 jabaki naman ojha (15) ke saath paanchaven wicket ke liye teen over main 34 ran bhi jode
 Kohli's decision proved correct 
 
 kohli ne toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji karne kaa faisla kiya or unke gendbaajon ne 29 ran tak hi virdohi team ko do jatke dekar captain ke faisle ko sahi sabit kiya
 Aaron Finch (130) hit a four and a six off Ashok Dinda's consecutive balls but was caught by wicketkeeper Parthiv in an attempt to hook Mitchell Starc's bouncer
 dinda ne lokesh rahul (06) ko slip main gail ke haathon kaich karaane apni team ko duusari safalataa dilaai
 Dhawan and Warner handled the innings
 
 
 captain dhawan or warner ne iske baad pari ko sambhala lekin donon ne shuruyaat main dhimi ballebaaji
 Dhawan and Warner hit a few fours in between but failed to increase the run pace
 aaron ne dhawan ko deep midwicket par abi devilliars ke haathon kaich karake warner ke saath unki saajhedaari kaa ant kiya
 Dhawan scored 37 runs in 36 balls with the help of four fours
 derren saimi (08) ne herschel patel par long of par chakka jadaa lekin isi over main dhimi gend ko samajhane se chook gaye or stark ko kaich de baithe

 It is believed that the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have started formulating a strategy in view of the assembly elections going to be held this year

 The Chief Minister is no longer responding to the allegations against the government and the Chief Minister

 Senior journalist Shiv Anurag Pateriya also believes that Chauhan does not want to bring himself into any controversy before the election

 Be it the issue of Bhojshala or someone else, Chauhan gave accountability to the weak people of the government

 paroksh rup se modi kaa bachaav karne waalon ne sweekaar kar liya ki ek vyakti kii jasusi karne ke liye rajya mashinari kaa durupyog kiya gaya
 Modi's team defends this espionage in two ways
 ve kehete hai ki soni or unki beti khud jasusi prakaran kii jaanch nahin chaahate, phir kya samasya he? unka doosraa bachaav he ki mahila ke pita apni beti kii suraksha chaahate the or unka maananaa tha ki vah pehle se vivaahit pradeep sharma ke saath ‘‘nazaij’’ rishta bana rahi he

 But when this issue came up in the meeting, Mohini had fallen before that

 "but, can Modi, who attacked the exploits of the UPA government, steal away from this mess of his government? At the root of this shameful espionage case is a gross violation of administrative procedures and dignity
" modi kii duvidha jatil he
 Accepting the neglect of procedures will be like confessing blame, and this fear of confessing prevents Modi from uttering the magical word "forgiveness", whether it is a case of the 2002 riots or action against his rebels
