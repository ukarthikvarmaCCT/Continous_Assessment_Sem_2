 purv kendriya mantri or bihar ke kaddavar netaa raghunatha jha kaa parthiv sharir patna pahunch gaya he
 He will be cremated on Tuesday at his ancestral village of Amba Kala in Shivhar
 ravivaar der raat dilli ke ek aspataal main raghunatha jha kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was 78 years old
 raghunatha jha bihar kii raajnneeti ke ek pramukh hasti the
 He was also an MLA from Shivhar for six consecutive terms and twice MP from Gopalganj and Bettiah respectively
 bihar sarkaar ke dedh darjan se adhik vibhaagon kaa jimmaa bhi sambhala
 Apart from this, Raghunath Jha was also the Minister of State for Heavy Industries in the previous Manmohan government
 raghunatha jha janata dal ke gathan ke baad uske pratham pradesh adhyaksh ke saath-saath samta party ke pradesh adhyaksh rahe the
 At the same time, the leader of Janata Legislature Party and chief whip of Janata Dal and Samata Party Dal was also there
 unhone saal 1990 main mukhyamantri pad kaa chunaav ladaa or lalu prasad ko mukhyamantri banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Lalu Prasad Yadav would not have become the Chief Minister of Bihar if Raghunath Jha had not lived
 1990 main jab bihar main takhta palat hua tha congress ko haraakar janata dal satta main ai thi us samay lalu prasad yadav ke dur-dur tak mukhyamantri banane kii charchaa nahin thi
 Lalu was an MP by winning Lok Sabha elections from Chapra in 1989
 lekin bihar main jab nai satta ai to mukhyamantri kii khoj shuru hui
 Devi Lal did this, at that time there was VP Singh's government at the center
 pradhanmantri veepi singh chaahate the ki ramsundar das bihar ke mukhyamantri bane, unke paas anubhav bhi tha or wo pehle bhi mukhyamantri rah chuke the lekin tatkaaleen uppradhanmantri devilal nahin chaahate the ki ramsundar das mukhyamantri bane
 Devi Lal forwarded Lalu Prasad Yadav to cut Ramsundar Das
 chunki lalu prasad yadav bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa rah chuke the isliye unka daawa bhi banataa tha
 In such a situation, elections had to be held for the leader of the legislative party
 vidhayak dal ke netaa ke liye ramsundar das or lalu prasad yadav aamane-saamne the lekin darasal ladaai veepi singh or devilal ke bich thi
 Lalu Yadav knew that he could beat the Legislature Party leader in this election
 kyonki ramsundar das ko pichhadon-daliton ke saath-saath savarna vidhayakon kaa bhi samarthan praapt tha
 There was a good rapport between Votedevilal and Chandrashekhar, who had gathered for Lalu and Raghunath Jha was special to Chandrasekhar, so it was decided to elect Lalu Prasad Yadav as the leader of the Legislative Party to put Raghunath Jha in this riot
 raghunatha jha khadey hue unhen 27 vidhayakon kaa samarthan mila
 But the victory was won by Lalu Prasad Yadav because Raghunath Jha succeeded in casting the vote of Ramsundar Das
 1997 main jab lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale main jail jane kii baat ai to raghunatha jha ne hi bayaan diya tha ki khun kii nadiyaan bah jaayegi
 However, after leaving differences with Lalu Prasad Yadav in 1998, he left RJD in 1998 and went to Nitish Kumar's party

 In this meeting, Congress Vice President Rahul targeted Prime Minister Modi and said that he is more interested in 'TRP Politics'
 rahul ne kaha ki modi apni hi chhavi ke bandi ho gaye hai or unki vajah se desh ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 On the issue of Kashmir, he said that there is an opportunistic alliance in the BJP-PDP
 
 Before this, Rahul has addressed the Congress Working Committee, the top deciding body of the Congress and now it is clear from the chairmanship of the Congress Parliamentary Party that Kikangress will be in his hands

 On the issue of demonetisation, Rahul said, "we have never seen such a Prime Minister before, who has put so much hard work on the countrymen to save his image

 In Uttar Pradesh, teachers who leave their children in school and disappear, are no longer well
 ab aise teachers kii pahchaan karke unke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath has found a new way to identify teachers who are missing from school
 mukhyamantri adityanath ne ravivaar ko yah nirdesh diya ki skulon main ab sabhi teachers or principal kii photo lagaai jaaegi
 The officers have been instructed to show the picture to the children and ask the teachers whether they come to teach in the school when they go to inspect the school
 agar vah skool aate hai to vidhyalay main kitna samay dete hai
 Yogi did this because there were also complaints from many places that many teachers do not go to school themselves, but instead send their own money to someone else to teach in school
 die kadi kaarywai ke nirdeshmukhyamantriyogi adityanathane uttar pradesh ke skulon main shiksha ke girte str par naaraazgi jataai or tatkaal ise sudhaarney ke upaay karne ke liye kaha he
 He said that such teachers will be identified and action taken against them
 upi main kai jagah par aisi shikaayatein ai thim ki kai hindu sanghathan or khud ko gorakshak kehane vaale log kanoon ko apane haath main le rahe hai
 But on Sunday, Yogi said that those who raise milch animals and leave them for strolling instead of fodder should be identified and action taken against them
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh ke shaharon main sadakon par aawaara ghoomte jaanavar ek badi samasya hai
 This not only causes dirt on the roads, but also causes problems in traffic
 kai baar jaanwaron kii vajah se durghatnaayen bhi hoti rahati hai
 It is a common practice in UP to leave animals stray instead of foddering them
 khaas taur par bundelkhand main yah badi samasya he
 The yogi has instructed that the animals who leave stray animals should be identified and fined

 The Ayodhya case seems to have been decided keeping faith and faith in mind
 logon kii aasthaa ke aadhaar par adaalat ne vivaadit sthal ko bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi ghoshit kiya he
 The best thing that happened with this decision is that all those elements who have been inciting communal fanaticism from time to time on this issue will not get any chance from this decision
 saath hi is faisle ke baad is mudde kaa koi raajnneetik phayda bhi nahin uthaa sakegaa
 Therefore, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has already said that the two other disputed sites (kashi and Mathura) should also be given ownership of them
 congress pehle bahut hi ashankit thi ki aakhir is maamle main kya faisla aayega lekin ab jab faisla aa gaya he to nishchit rup se congress bahut khush hogi kyonki ab bijepi bhavishya main hone vaale chunaavon main ram mandir ke mudde ko bhunaa nahin paaegi
 The immediate impact of this decision will be seen in the campaigning for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections

 Therefore, there is a need to see how the state government handles the situation
 abhi ek baat to spasht he sunni vakf board faisle ke khilaaf supreme court me apil karne ja rahaa he
 The opinion of the majority in the bench of three judges of Allahabad High Court was that 2
 77 acre ke vivaadit sthal par jahaan 1992 main dhahaae jane se pehle babari masjid sthiti thi, par hindu or musalamaanon donon kaa hi adhikaar he
 Since all the three sides of the case were seeking their possession on the disputed land, it is very likely that they would appeal to the Supreme Court
 lekin yah tay he ki muslim paksh supreme court main jarur apil karenge kyonki court ne faisla sunaane ke liye hinduon kii aasthaa or dharmik vishwaas ko aadhaar banaaya he, or masjid ke bich vaale gumbad ke neeche ke sthaan par hinduon ko swaamitv diya he
 The court has considered the place to be the birthplace of Ramlala
 jajon ne mana ki vivaadit sthal par kisi bhi paksh kaa spasht adhikaar sabit nahin hota he
 The judges decided that the disputed land should be divided into three equal parts, of which a portion should be given to the Sunni Waqf Board
 baaki ke do hisson main se ek-ek shri ramalala virajman or nirmohi akhaade ko diya jaae
 Only Judge Dharamvir Sharma wanted the entire disputed site to be handed over to the Hindus
 gauratlab he ki nyaayadhish sharma 1 oktober ko sevanivrutt ho rahe hai
 The remaining two judges, Justice Sudhir Aggarwal and Justice SU Khan, decided to divide the land into three parts
 baharhaal, abhi jahaan ramalala virajman he wo jagah shri ramalala virajman ko di gai he jabaki ram chabutara or sita kii rasoi par nirmohi akhaade ko swaamitv diya gaya he

 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the opposition alleged that electronic voting machines (evms) and vvpats (voter verified paper trail machines) were being tampered with
 chunaav ayog ne aaropon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 When asked to comment on the allegations, Qureshi said, "there is no possibility of tampering of evms or VVPAT system
 mashin alag aankade nahin dikhaa sakati
 'he said,' Each time you press the button, there will be only one figure in it
 main aarope samaj bhi nahin paa rahaa
 However, the Election Commission must convince the opposition and the people that the system is sound
 hamen logon ko saath lenaa hoga
 He said at a function in Delhi that the faith of the people has to be maintained and it has to be won
 kuraishi ne kaha ki iviem main chhedchhad nahin ho sakati kyonki kai jaanchen hoti hai
 At the same time, he said, "nobody has yet proved that it can be tampered with and any possibility of tampering should be completely eradicated once the VVPAT is introduced
" ' mataptr pranali kii ore waapas lautne kii vipaksh kii maang par kuraishi ne kaha ki iviem samaapt karne kii bajaay, in mashiinon main sudhaar kii sambhaavna talaashi jaani chahie
 Qureshi said, 'there is no question of returning to the ballot

 If further improvement is needed, it should be seen

 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjheepar, who was in the news due to his statements more than work, tried to throw a shoe on Monday

 Police and security personnel present on the spot have taken the youth into custody

 According to the information, CM Manjhi was present in the Janata Durbar on Monday
 har din kii tarah kaarykram chal rahaa tha, tabhi bich main ek yuvak uthaa or usne siem kii ore juuta phenkane kii koshish kii
 However, the people and security personnel present there sensed it in time and the shoe could not reach Manjhi
 police ne yuvak ko hiraasat main le liya he, lekin usne aisa kyon kiya is babat abhi tak koi jaankaree saamne nahin ai he
 Significantly, the incident of throwing shoes at politicians has happened even before this
 beete saal punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal par bhi swatantraaa diwas kaarykram ke dauraan ek yuvak ne juuta oochaal diya tha
 While the Congress prince Rahul Gandhi is also one of the politicians on whom the shoe has been thrown

 Tejaswi is looking for Yadav with his pro-people and activist lanterns
 lekin ek baar phir wo bihar se gaayab he
 It is learned that Tejashwi Yadav is campaigning for brother-in-law Chiranjeevi Rao in Rebari in Haryana elections
 aise main unpar janata kii andekhi kaa aarope lag rahaa he
 It is being said that the people of the state are troubled by the floods but Tejashwi Yadav does not have the time to take care of them

 darasal tejasvi yadav haryana chunaav main congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe apane bahanoi chiranjeevi raav ke liye rebadi main prachaar kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether Tejashwi Yadav values his kinship more than the people of Bihar
 bihar main siyasat tesapane bahanoi ke namakan se lekar chunaav prachaar kaa jimmaa tejasvi yadav sanbhale hue hai
 In such a situation, the politics in Bihar has intensified
 raajnneeti ke jaankaar maanate hai ki loksabhaa main mili karaari shikast ke baad se abtak tejasvi yadav ubar nahin paae hai, isliye ve lagaataar bihar se gaayab rah rahe hai
 Whether it is the case of the death of children in Muzaffarpur or the floods in Bihar, Tejashwi has no time to take care of the people of Bihar

 It asked the trial court to take a fresh decision on the application of a murderer who claimed to be a juvenile
 aavedan par sunwaayee karte hue nyaayamurti kailash gambhir ne kaha ki ‘‘kishor nyaay kanoon kahata he ki haddiyon kii jaanch ke aadhaar par aaropee kii umr kaa pataa lagane ke liye, report yathayogy rup se gathit medical board se aani chahie, na ki ekal sadasyeey team se jo akele sahi raay dene main sakasham nahin ho sakati
 The High Court said that the case is therefore referred back to the lower court with the direction that it should seek a fresh report from the Medical Board of a suitably constituted government hospital comprising at least one dental specialist, a general physician and a radiologist 
 adaalat ne yah aadesh hatyaropee kii yachika par diya
 She had challenged the lower court's decision to dismiss her plea which refused to grant her relief under the Juvenile Justice Act and did not consider her school certificate to be of age

 Kejriwal said that we need money to contest elections, you donate freely

 What did Arvind Kejriwal say in the party's first rally after the election, the whole thing in his words

 First of all, some people have the misconception that we have gathered to celebrate today

 These people did not love Arvind or Aam Aadmi Party
 inhen desh badalane kii aashaa dikhaai di
 These friends have brought hope
 ye bahut badi baat hui he
 When people started saying that nothing can change here, then this movement has given a hope
 aap logon ne bahut bada kaam kiya he
 Congratulations
 aapke pariwaron ko bhi badhai
 There are many volunteers here, whose wife, children and family supported them
 kai parivaar vaale aise bhi hai, jinka betaa yaa beti jab is movement main aae, to unhen takalif hui, virodh bhi kiya
 But these people did not care
 un sabko bhi badhaijab rickshaw chalaane vaale ne daan kiye 30 rupee
 
 
 i was doing a road show for a month
 ek din is sho ke dauraan ek garib aadmi aayaa
 He put his hand in his pocket and gave all the money he had
 bolaa ki main rickshaw chalaata hum or subah se tees rupye kamaaye hai
 i want to donate this to your party
 doston ye chunaav us rickshawvaale ne lada he
 It is fought by Vijay Baba, who drives a rickshaw and has been running a rickshaw for six months without any money for the party
 or kin logon ne ladaa chunaav
 These fellows sitting on the stage, whom no one knows
 koun hai ye log
 nobody knows
 raakhi birla ek choti si ladki he jisane congress ke cabinet mantri rajkumaar chouhan ko haraa diya
 No one could have imagined that one would be able to beat the winner for twenty years
 ye vandana
 a modest housewife, he defeated MLA Rabindra Bansal for 15 years
 ye civil services ke mens kii padhai chhodkar aae akhilesh treepathi ne ek manze netaa ko haraa diya
 These are all common people
 kejariwal ne padhakar sunai maarmik chittheedesh ke netaaon ko gurur ho gaya tha ki ve lutate rahenge
 It was not known that if the common man stood up, his throne would be shaken
 ab hamen ye ladaai puure desh main lekar jaani he
 There are many of you, who were earlier in Congress and BJP
 magar ab sab apni pichhali partiyaan chhodkar desh ke liye lard rahe hai
 Just two minutes ago someone has given me a very touching letter
 main aapako padhakar sunaata hum
 Respected Arvind ji meraa naam bajrang agarwal he
 i am a resident of Rohini
 lau graduate hum or congress ke liye kai barason se kaam karata tha
 i have a burden in my mind that i spent my precious time for a party which is steeped in corruption
 jab aapane andolan shuru kiya to lagata tha ki ek akelaa chalaa bhaad nahin phod saktaa
 But today it seems that hell cannot break, it can shatter it
 jab 4 disambar ko voting ke baad main ghar pahunchaa to mere paanch saal ke bete ne poocha, koun chunaav jeeta
 i said, the son has not yet come to the result
 wo bade utsaah se bolaa ki dekhnaa hamaari jhaadu jeetegi
 i felt that i had done something wrong
 maine poocha ki use kya pataa he
 So he said that all my friends are saying that these sweep countries will change, they are very good people
 agar meraa betaa ye nahin kahata to shaayad main ye patr nahin likhata
 Now the burden has reduced somewhat
 kahin kal kisi aam aadmi ko hamaara ghamand todane ko na uthanaa padeyaha par hamaare jo vidhayak saathi baithe hai, unase prarthana he, ghamand main mat aa janaa
 Today we have broken the arrogance of BJP and Congress, lest any common man should stand up and break our ego tomorrow
 aap logon ko badi jimmedaari di he
 You do not have to be a leader MLA
 logon kii seva karnaa he
 i came to know that in some places celebrating, crackers burst
 kis cheez kaa jashn he
 What is our victory? desh ke logon kii jeet he
 Your job is not to burst crackers, but to serve the public
 jaraa sa bhi ghamand na laana, varna jis cheez ko badalane chale hai, usee kaa hissaa ban jaaenge
 AAP has not got 28 seats in majority due to flashlight
 aisa nahin ki hamen bahumat nahin mil saktaa tha
 But at the last moment, the opponents adopted many tricks
 16 vidhansabhaon main jhaadu se miltaa chunaav chihn torch nikaala
 It looked exactly like a broom
 16 jagah is chihn ke saath nirdaleey khadey kiye gaye
 Nobody knew them
 inhone prachaar nahin kiya
 But still he got four to five thousand votes
 log galatfahami main un par batan dabaakar aa gaye
 Like in Kalkaji we lost by 2 thousand votes
 magar torch ko 3500 se zyada vot mili
 Polling took place that day at half past nine
 magar kuch channelon ne paanch baje ke baad dikhaanaa shuru kar diya ki bijepi ko bahumat mil rahaa he or aam aadmi party chah siton par simat jaaegi
 Because of this, angry people against the Congress came to vote for BJP, fearing that their vote might be wasted
 magar thik he
 Whatever the one above does, heals
 hamen 28 seat milin, iskaa upar vaale ko shukriya
 Now we will take this fight forward from here
 paise kaa khub khel chalaa
 Drinks and money were distributed among the slums
 hamen dar lag rahaa tha ki paise daaru lekar vot bik to nahin jayega
 But the data is telling that slum dwellers took the most money
 magar vot jhaadu par daalaa
 Congratulations to them
 65 saal se dhokhaa de rahi partiyon ko logon ne dhokhaa diya or isse ve baukhala gai hai
 The losing MLA has gone to Bokhla
 kai jagah se samachar mil rahe hai
 News came from one assembly seat that the mlas who were till now had the keys to all the water booster pumps
 unhone pani dena band kar diya
 Another MLA said that now stop picking up garbage
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta uthaa len ab kooda
 My party has an appeal to mlas
 chunaav haarane waalon se apil he ki janata ke bich jaaen or kaam karen
 Was it difficult to buy 4 seats? BJP got 31 seats in the election
 ek akali dal ko mili
 We got 28 seats
 to sarkaar to bijepi ko banani thi
 It was difficult for them to buy four seats
 abhi tak karte aae hai
 But they said that they will not do so
 acchhee baat he, der aayad durust aayad
 My question to the BJP is if they do not get a majority in the Center or any other state, will they stop forming the government
 yaa phir yah kora dhakosla he
 Congress and BJP together form the government BJP and Congress are similar parties
 donon karpshan auki danga karaati hai
 Now the two together form the government, the Aam Aadmi Party will sit in the opposition
 agar in donon partiyon ne dilli par chunaav thopa to kya ham taiyaar hai
 Yes we are ready dilli ke log taiyaar hai
 Voting the BJP in the next election is a waste of votes
 kyonki vah jimmedaari se bhaagate hai
 We are not coming to enjoy power
 ab ladai puure desh main le jaani he
 The people of Delhi have given a direction to the country
 jisko tikat dena chaah rahe the, uske pita pairon main gir gaeek ladkaa he, ham use tikat dene kii soch rahe the
 His father came and fell in the legs
 bole use tikat mat do
 He will serve the party all his life, but politics is the work of goons
 use keechad main mat daalo
 This was the thinking of the people
 magar ab soch badal rahi he
 Now this flame has to be carried all over the country
 ye kaam chand log nahin kar sakate
 Our party people cannot
 ye aam aadmi party kii ladaai nahin he
 This is the fight of the country
 to main is manch se aahvaan karnaa chahta hum ki desh ke achche log, acchhee raajnneetik takatein, achche andolan ikatthe ho jaaen
 There is a chance to change this country
 agar aisa ho gaya, to jald desh sone kii chidiya kehalaayegaa
 All honest businessmen and industrialists of this country should come to the Aam Aadmi Party
 bijepi or congress ke eemaandaar log apni ghutan chhod aazaadee kii is ladaai main shaamil hon
 Government is not bringing Lokpal Jokpal bill, Anna Hazare ji is sitting on hunger strike
 sarkaar ne aaj ek bayaan diya he ki lokapal bill loksabhaa main paarit ho gaya
 But there is one left in the Rajya Sabha
 doston loksabhaa main paarit lokapal nahin jokapaal bill he
 The people of this country will not consider it
 isse karpshan badhegaa
 We are with Anna ji, body and money
 anna ji kii jagrati ko salaam karte hai
 Tomorrow i and Kumar Vishwas are going to meet Anna ji
 unhone kaha raajnneetik party ke logon ko manch par nahin aane denge
 We will not go and sit in front of the public
 ant main saathiyon
 This movement started with your money
 hamaare paas to tha nahin
 But now we have to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 dobaaraa dilli kaa bhi chunaav ladanaa he
 Now we need donations aaj main aahvaan karnaa chahta hum

 ' Former India cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has scuttled the icc's decision to end the runner's system for an injured or tired batsman in one-day international cricket
 unhone kaha ki yadi ballebaajon ko ranor nahin diya ja saktaa to gendbaajon ko bhi pani pine kii sweekruti nahin milani chahie, kyonki niyam sabhi ke liye samaan hone chahie
 The ICC Executive Committee has decided not to provide runners facilities to injured batsmen in one-day internationals and Gavaskar has said that if this is the case, the rules should be tightened for the fielding team as well
 naaraaz gavaskar ne 'enditivi' se kaha, "main yah bhi suzav dena chahta hum ki boundry ke sameep gendbaajon ke liye bhi pani nahin hona chahie
 They throw an over and reach the boundary, where an energy drink awaits them

 jammu kashmir main sarkaar banane par ravivaar ko bhi koi faisla nahin hua
 In a marathon meeting of the pdp's core group that lasted almost five hours, party leaders unanimously decided that party president Mehbooba Mufti would take the final decision on forming a government with the BJP
 purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne meeting khatm hone ke baad twit kiya, 'ab bahut ho chukaa
 If you can't do anything, end the alliance and go back to the public again
 'enough is enough
 If you can't rise to the occasion end the coalition & lets go back to the people again

 co / h1fesqj5mb— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) January 17, 2016 Marathon meeting not held Last mourning the death of the father-in-law, Mehbooba Mufti called a meeting of the ppdpcore group on Sunday
 pidipi ke pravaktaa naeem akhtar ne bataaya ki baithak lagbhag paanch ghanta chali, jisamen bijepi se gathbandhan par koi faisla nahin ho paaya
 Akhtar said, "the party president Mehbooba Mufti will take a final decision on the alliance with the BJP
 ' unhone kaha ki is baithak main party ke sabhi netaaon ne apane vichaar rakhen
 What said Farooq Nefarooq Abdullah, while targeting the PDP and BJP, said that 'he has a mandate
 ve baithen or batkar aapasi masale sulajhaayen
 If they cannot solve the problems of the people, then dissolve the assembly and allow fresh elections
 faruk ne isse bhi inkaar kiya ki unhone bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kii baat kahi he
 "I just said that if i come to any such proposal, we will consider it
" 'sarkaar banane kaa prastaavsarkaar ko lekar jari kayaasabaaji ke bich neshnal conference (NC) pramukh or purv mukhyamantri faruk abdulla shanivaar der raat rajyapal enen vohara se mili
 Earlier, taking advantage of Mehbooba's pressing of his cards, Farooq has also proposed to run a government in alliance with the BJP
 kya kahata he siton kaa samikarnsarkaar banane ke liye kisi bhi gathbandhan ko 44 kaa aankada choona jaruri he
 In 2014 elections, PDP got 28 seats and BJP 25 seats
 jabaki NC 15 siten hi laa pai thi
 Even if it merges with the BJP, it still falls short of 4 seats
 bijepi ke rahete congress saath aegi nahin
 So this alliance will have to bring other and independents together
 lekin sarkaar bananaa utana mushkil bhi nahin he
 What was said Farooq Nefarooq said on Saturday, 'if offered, the party is ready to consider an alliance with BJP to form the government
 yadi bijepi kii ore se prastaav aata he to neshnal conference kaary-samiti kii baithak bulaaegi or is par charchaa karegi
 We have not closed the doors
 hamaare daravaaje khule hai
 Vattal's visit to Srinagar, a day before, the PDP said that it would review the progress made in the implementation of the coalition agenda and Mufti's approach between the two parties before deciding on the formation of a new government in the state
 is prishthbhumi main kendriya vitt sachiv arapy vattal guuruuvaar ko srinagar aae or unhone mahabuuba mufti se mulaakaat kii thi
 The PDP, however, said that Vattal had met Mehbooba only to express condolences
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki centre sarkaar ke is adhikari ne unhen yah bataaya ki modi sarkaar dwaara kya kiya ja chukaa he or rajya ke liye kya kiye jane kii yojana he
 What the BJP is thinking, it is being understood that the BJP maintains that the PDP will have to take the first step by electing its Legislature Party leader, only then can he support the regional party to form the government in the state
 isse pehle pidipi netaa naeem akhtar ne kaha tha, 'mufti sahab kaa jammu kashmir ko aadhunik rajya banane kaa ek najariya tha
 Due to his demise, that goal could not be realized
 mahabuuba mufti ke netritv main party ko is baat kii samiksha karne kii aavashyaktaa he ki ham abhi tak mufti sahab ke nazariye ko puraa karne main kitne safal hue hai
 ' punjab neshnal bank dhokhadhadi maamle main aaropee mehul chokasee ko clin chit die jane ke maamle ko lekar sibiai or mumbai police ke bich blem game shuru ho gaya he
 CBI sources say that he had not received any appeal from Interpol Antigua to investigate Mehul Choksi's background
 unhone bataaya ki mehul chokasee ke becoground kii jaanch karne ke liye videsh mantralay ne mumbai riginal passport offis ko aavedan bheja tha
 After this, the Mumbai Regional Passport Office wrote a letter to the Mumbai Police in this regard
 sibiai sutron kaa kahana he ki mehul chokasee ke becoground check karne kii jimmedaari mumbai police special branch kii he
 Senior officials say there are civil cases against Choksi
 lihaaja uske aavedan ko clin chit dene se rokane kaa koi vaazib kaaran nahin tha
 Let me tell you that more than a dozen cases have been filed against Mehul Choksi across the country
 sibiai sutron kaa kahana he ki pienbi scam main giraftaar ek aaropee nemehul choksike bank audit ko lekar aagaah kiya tha
 Choksi then applied for citizenship in Antigua
 ab sibiai ne mehul chokasee ke pratyrpan ke liye videsh mantralay ko apil bheji he
 Similarly, Nirav Modi also applied for permanent residence in Singapore, but the government there rejected his application after contacting India
 sibiai or mumbai police ke bich blem game kaa maamla us samay saamne aayaa he, jab antigua ne daawa kiya ki saal 2017 menmehul choksiko naagarikta dene se pehle uske becoground kii jaanch kii gai thi, tab bhartiya agenciyon ne bataaya tha ki arbapati chokasee ke khilaaf koi maamla nahin he
 The Antigua body responsible for granting investment-related citizenship also named SEBI in the Indian agency sanctioning Choksi's case
 haalanki sebi ne is daawey ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki use kabhi aisa koi anurodh nahin mila or naa hi usne antigua main sakasham praadhikaar ko aisi koi soochna di

 Plastic is being recycled to save the environment
 plastic (plastic) se kai upyogi vasteen banaai ja rahi hai
 You cannot even imagine what a professor in Hyderabad made of plastic
 hyderabad ke rahane vaale 45 varshiya professor satish kumaar (satish Kumar) ne plastic se petrol banane kaa karnama kar logon ko hairaan kar diya he
 He has named the process of making petrol from plastics called plastic pyrolysis
 satish kumaar ne hydroxi privet limited naam se ek company banaai he
 Which is registered under the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
 News18 ke mutabik satish kaa kahana he ki plastic pirolisis prakriya kii madad se plastic se dijal, aviation ful or petrol banaaya ja saktaa he
 About 500 kilograms of recycled plastic can produce 400 liters of fuel
 unhone kaha ki yah ek aasaan prakriya he jisamen pani kaa upyog nahin hota he or na hi ganda pani nikalataa he
 Also, it does not pollute the air because this process takes place in vacuum
 narendra modi ke banaras se chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi yah suspence khatm ho gaya ki vah uttar pradesh se chunaav ladenge yaa nahin
 The interesting thing is that there is suspense in the media, but Narendra Modi himself took this decision only in July last year
 party ke varishthatam netaaon ko yah jaankaree de di gai thi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke netritv se bhi vichaar-vimarsh kar liya gaya tha
 In fact, the plan was that Modi would contest from LK Advani's seat Gandhinagar in Gujarat and Murali Manohar Joshi's seat in Uttar Pradesh from Benaras
 in donon hi varishthatam netaaon ko rajyasabha bheja janaa tha, taaki party main modi ke netritv ko lekar koi bhram nahin rahe
 However, this plan did not materialize
 adwani-joshi donon hi is baat ke liye taiyaar nahin hue ki ve loksabhaa chunaav na laden
 The Sangh too did not agree to pressurize these two leaders beyond a limit
 nateeja yah he ki joshi ne modi ke liye banaras kii seat to khaali kii, magar unhen kanpur bhejnaa padaa
 Similarly, Advani is adamant on contesting from Gandhinagar, so Modi will contest from the nearby Ahmedabad East seat
 modi ke sipahsalaar amit shah uttar pradesh main party ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 After wandering across the state and meeting all the people, he gave the feedback that BJP is getting tremendous support in the name of Modi
 modi kii vikaas or hindutv kii chhavi rajya main barason se chali aa rahi jatigat raajnneeti par baari pad rahi he
 Modi's backward class is becoming more beneficial for the BJP, because the message is going to the backward class that for the first time a strong person in the country is going to become Prime Minister from his class through BJP
 amit shah kaa yah bhi suzav tha ki agar modi upi se ladate hai, to iskaa faaydaa puure purvanchal main milegaa
 By the way, caste equations have been taken special care in the bjp's first list of 53 candidates for Uttar Pradesh
 sangh ke hisaab se aath praanton main vibhajit upi ke liye bijepi kii suchi main yah jor he ki aasapaas kii siton par tikat dete samay ummidavaar kii jati kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaae, taaki santulan bana rahe
 Amit Shah has been telling the party leaders of the state that the election will be fought in the name of Modi and hence the message should be given to the people that Modi is contesting on every seat
 upi main bijepi ne kisi duusare dal se gathbandhan nahin kiya he, na hi chote dalon ke saath talmail ho paaya he
 To compensate for this, the party is giving tickets with some powerful leaders from other parties
 badi sankhya main vidhayakon ko bhi tikat diya gaya he
 Despite all this, the entire focus of bjp's campaign in UP will remain on Narendra Modi
 koi hairaani nahin he ki modi kii banaras raily ke vaqt shuru hua 'har-har modi, ghar-ghar modi' kaa bijepi kaa naaraa ab puure uttar pradesh main 'jan-jan modi, ghar-ghar modi' ke rup main gunj rahaa he
 Even if you have cooked with a lot of hard work
 usamen wo har cheez daali ho jisaki jarurat ho lekin agar aapke khaane main namak kaa anupaat sahi nahin he to aapaki sari mehnat barbaad ho jaati he
 Salt is very effective in everything from eating and drinking to improving beauty and cleaning the house
 ji haa, agar aap ye sochate hai kinmak sirf khaane main swaad ke liye hi istemaal kiya jaataa haito shaayad aapako iske duusare phaaydon ke bare main pataa nahin hoga
 1
 lohe ke bartanon se daag saaf karne ke lienmak kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 2
 sinc saaf karne ke liye bhi namak kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 3
 kadhahi main jaale ke daag ko saaf karne ke liye bhi namak kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 4
 kai baar bartanon main pani kaa daag bhi ban jaataa he
 It can also be overcome with the help of salt
 5
 Brass and copper utensils shine when cleaned with salt
 6
 Pottery rust can also be cleaned with salt
 7
 Frozen coffee or tea stains on the cup are cleaned with salt
 8
 Salt is also used to clean the fridge
 9
 Spots on furniture can be cleaned with this
 10
 After cleaning the bath with salt, the frozen spots are removed
 saath hi usame maujuud bacteria bhi mar jate hai

 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had left after President Padasonia Gandhi became the President, Rahul's close associates Gajatanwar and Sanjay Nirupam openly accused Sonia's close after Rahul Gandhi took the responsibility of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 Resigned as chairman
 lambey samay tak unki maan-manouvval chalati rahi, lekin rahul nahin maane or antat: rahul kii jagah sonia gandhi ko congress kaa antarim adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya
 As soon as Sonia took command, there was talk of the old guard being reactive in the Congress and the crisis of getting close to Rahul's close friends also started
 kai maukon par aisa hi dekhne ko mila
 Recently, Ashok Tanwar, who left the party, also made similar allegations and Sanjay Nirupam also directly advised Sonia Gandhi to avoid his close ones
 rahul gandhi ke netritv main ashok tanvar, sanjay nirupam, milind devda, deb burman or navjot singh siddhu jaise chehron ko tarjeeh milti rahi
 But as soon as Rahul left the presidency after the defeat of the Lok Sabha elections, these close quarters started falling apart
 punjab cabinet main mantri navjot singh siddhu or mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke bich kai maukon par khinchataan najar ai
 Sidhu kept telling Rahul as his captain and could never accept Amarinder Singh as his leader
 antat: nateeja ye hua ki siddhu kii pari captain amarinder ke saamne feeki pad gai or unhen sabakuch ganvaana padaa
 Ashok Tanwar's leaf cut In recent times, Rahul's team also suffered a setback in Haryana when Ashok Tanwar was removed from the post of president
 purv mukhyamantri or varisht netaa bhupinder singh hooda lagaataar ashok tanvar kaa virodh karte rahe or chunaav se thik pehle sonia gandhi ke netritv vaali congress ne unhen jimmedaari se mukt kar diya
 However, Samajya Hooda or his family was not handed over the command of the party and attempts were made to reconcile by handing over the command of the state to Kumari Selja, considered close to Sonia
 is faisle main sonia kii team kii jhalak saaf najar ai
 Sonia Gandhi has close relations with Ahmed Patel and Hooda
 yahi nahin haryana ke incharge gulam nabi aaazaad bhi lagaataar alaakaman ko yahi samajhaate rahe ki bijepi ke saamne bhupendra singh hooda ke alaava kisi kaa sikaa nahin chal paaegaa
 Hence, Hooda proved to be the winner in this entire battle
 sanjay nirupam ne bhi uthaae sawalmumbai congress ke adhyaksh rahe sanjay nirupam ne bhi chunaav ke bich party ko bada jhatka diya
 Questioning the party leadership, Sanjay Nirupam said that Sonia Gandhi needs liberation water from her courtiers
 haalanki, unhone yah bhi kaha ki wo sonia gandhi ke khilaaf nahin he, lekin nirupam ne rahul gandhi se vanvaas khatm kar party kii kaman sanbhaalane kii bhi apil kii
 This statement by Sanjay Nirupam has also served to bring the internal deadlock between Sonia Gandhi and Rahul's team within the Congress on the public platform
 duusari taraf ashok tanvar ne spasht taur par sonia gandhi kii team ke netaaon par gambhir iljaam lagaae or daawa kiya ki party ne rahul gandhi ke vafaadaaron ko kinare kiya he
 Congress leader in Tripura has also been taken away by Pradyut Deb Burman, a young leader considered to be one such close to Rahul Gandhi
 pradesh adhyaksh pad se istipha dene par deb burman ne kaha tha ki congress main bhrasht logon kii entry ho chuki he
 Apart from Deb Burman, Milind Deora, considered close to Rahul Gandhi, has also had to resign from the post of Mumbai Congress President
 yani loksabhaa chunaav kii haar ke baad rahul gandhi kaa adhyaksh pad chhodana unke kai kareebi netaaon par baari padaa he
 This is the reason why even close to Rahul, being on the sidelines as Sonia Gandhi's president, is raising this issue openly and is advising Sonia Gandhi to avoid her near ones
 assam ke nalbari jile main shuukravaar ko artiai kaaryakarta or team anna ke sadsy akhil gogoi par yuva congress ke sandigdh kaaryakartaaon ne hamalaa kiya, jisamen vah gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye
 Police said that he had gone to Punni village in Dharampur area of gogoi district to take stock of the flood situation
 vahaan kathith rup se un par laathiyon or duusare tej hathiyaaron se hamalaa kiya gaya
 The comments gogoi ne nalbari police thane main praathmiki darj karaate hue aarope lagaaya ki assam ke krishi or sansadeey maamalon ke mantri nilamani sen deka ke ishaare par chah yuva congressi kaaryakartaaon ne un par hamalaa kiya
 Deka is an MLA from Dharampur assembly constituency
 gogai krishak mukti sangram samiti (keemess) ke bhi mahasachiv hai
 Gogoi suffered a head injury

 (all short stories and scriptures translated from English by Balram Aggarwal) maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav aise doraahe par khadey hai, jahaan ek-duusare ke saath kii kasame to gathbandhan ke donon sahyogi kha rahe hai, lekin niyat par shaq bhi saath-saath chal rahaa he
 This is a very complicated picture of political bargain, where everyone is assuming that one is not going to work without the other, so it is all ready to get along with you
 maharashtra main kul 288 vidhansabha siten hai, or shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan ke bich ab tak 169−119 kaa formula chalata rahaa he, jise bijepi ab kisi bhi haal main badalanaa chaahati he
 This demand of his is borne out by the confidence, whose base is his best strike rate so far
 haal hi main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 23 or shivasena ko 18 siten mili hai, or bijepi maharashtra main sabase zyada vot paane vaali party ke taur par ubhari he
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2014, BJP got 27 per cent votes, while Shiv Sena got 21 per cent, and these increased votes are encouraging the BJP, and that is why Shiv Sena does not forget to remind again and again that it was more about the Lok Sabha
 The story is something else
 vaise is gathbandhan kii loksabhaa kii jeet ko vidhansabha siton main tabdeel kar diya jaae to inhen kareeb 231 siten mil sakati hai
 The BJP is now saying that the formula of 135–135 should be implemented, that is, equal seats, and the remaining 18 seats should be given to fellow parties
 bijepi kaa nayaa formula he - jisaki jitani takat, uski utani haisiyat
 
 
 Shiv Sena is not ready for this, she has been believing that she has been giving preference to BJP in Lok Sabha elections
 pichley kuch samay main bijepi ne khud ko nae sire se pesh kiya he, or donon dalon ke bich kaa shishtachar bhi is ankaganit kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 When BJP national president Amit Shah came to Mumbai, all the programs were pre-decided, and there was no program for the Shiv Sena chief to go home, but the formalities of going home were completed after his arrival
 yah bataata he ki shivasena ab sirf bijepi ke kadamon par kayaas laga sakati he, or kayaason kaa yah daur aage bhi jari rahane vaala he, kyonki amit shah phir rajya ke teen din ke daure par aane vaale hai, or aisa koi sanket ab tak nahin mila he ki vah is ganit ko sulajhane ke liye aage aaenge
 On this era of speculation, the small leaders of both the parties are creating an atmosphere against each other, but the big leaders are silent, because no one is currently in the condition of going 'across' or 'across'

 com / 0mjirwkege The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Saturday decided to withdraw from the Sunnit Progressive Alliance (UPA) government due to inability to form a partnership with the Congress in view of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections
 party ne congress se saat varsh purana naata todate hue sarkaar ko keval 'muddon par aadhaarit samarthan dene' kaa faisla kiya he
 The party has asked its ministers in the government to resign
 kaha ja rahaa he diemke ne dabaav kii ranneeti ke tahat yah faisla kiya he
 Senior party leader TR Balu, however, clarified that the party's decision was related to the former Union Telecom Minister A, jailed in the 2G spectrum scam case
 raja or karunanidhi ke parivaar ke niyantran vaale televijan channel claygnar par kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) dwaara maare gaye chaape se nahin he
 On this decision of DMK, it has been said by the Congress that whatever problems are there with DMK, it will overcome it
 congress sutron ne kaha he ki diemke ke is kadam se sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 Whereas BJP has said that this has given the Congress' second major setback
 ' mukhyamantri em
 The decision was taken at a party meeting chaired by Karunanidhi
 baithak main up mukhyamantri emke stallin sahit party ke sabhi varisht netaa maujuud the
 The resolution passed in the meeting said that the DMK would only give 'issues-based support' to the Congress-led Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government
 congress or diemke ke bich paidaa hui is daraar kaa kaaran vidhansabha siton kii saajhedaari par sahmati na bananaa bataaya gaya he
 Out of 234 seats in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, the Congress wanted to field its candidate in 63 seats
 karunanidhi congress kii is maang ko saarvajanik rup se 'asangat' bataa chuke hai
 According to DMK leaders, whenever there is agreement in the talks with Congress on seat sharing
 uske baad congress ne nai maangon kii peshkash kii he
 Senior party leader and former Union Minister TR Balu told reporters that Congress leaders, especially Ahmed Patel, have been informed about the decision in New Delhi
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar main shaamil party ke chah mantri apana istipha saunpane ke liye nai dilli jaaenge
 a statement from the DMK said that the party was ready to give the Congress 60 seats in the assembly but the Congress demanded 63 seats
 karunanidhi ne kaha ki vah pehle congress ko vidhansabha chunaavon main 51 siten dena chaahate the lekin unhone yah sankhya badhaakar 53 phir 55 or ant main 60 kar di
 He said, "is it practical for Congress to demand 63 seats?" It is noteworthy that DMK has formed electoral alliance with five parties giving 52 seats
 inamen keemke (7), memke (1), visike (10), piemke (31) or indian union muslim lig (3) shaamil hai
 After giving 60 seats to the Congress, the DMK will have only 122 seats for itself
 yadi vah congress ko 63 siten de detii he to diemke ke paas 119 siten bachengi, jo ki 234 sadasyeey vidhansabha kii aadhi sankhya se maatr do seat adhik he
 Elections are due in Tamil Nadu on 13 April
 is bich ol india anna dravid munetra kadgam (ediemke) ne siton kii saajhedaari ko lekar rajya kii chah choti partiyon ke saath samjhauta kiya he
 The AIADMK has given him 43 seats
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki ediemke ravivaar ko do vam panthi partiyon ke saath samjhauta karegi
 Reacting to the dmk's move, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that this gave the Congress 'second major setback'
 ' usne kaha ki 'vah ghatnaon par baariki se najar rakh rahi he
 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, "the Congress party is constantly reeling under allegations of corruption
 isi bich use diemke se doosraa bada jhatka laga he
 The BJP is closely monitoring the developments there
 " iske pehle siton kii saajhedaari ko lekar diemke ke saath jari gatirodh par kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne sweekaar kiya tha ki ise lekar kuch 'samasyaayein ' hai lekin 'inhen dur kar liya jayega
 "he said," Our political relations often face some problems
 hamamen samasya paidaa karne or tatkaal unka hal nikaal lene kii kshamta he, isliye in samasyaon kaa hal nikal aayega
 "congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said," i do not want to comment on the break-up of the alliance as the decision has been taken amid negotiations for seat sharing
 " kendriya swasthya mantri va congress ke tamilnadu prabharee, gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha tha ki tamilnadu main siton kii saajhedaari ko lekar diemke ke saath baatcheet jari he or aashaa he ki diemke gathbandhan nahin todega
 Azad told reporters here, “I went to Tamil Nadu to hold talks to identify the assembly constituencies
 aashaa he ve gathbandhan nahin todenge
 " chhattisgarh main soshal media par bijli katautee se judi afvaah failaane ke aarope main police ne ek shaks ko giraftaar kiya he
 Mangalal Agarwal, a resident of Mussara Dongargarh in Rajnandgaon district, was arrested for spreading rumors of power cuts
 unke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 124e (rajdroh kaa maamla) or dhara 505 / 1 / 2 (sarkaar ke khilaaf dushprachaar) ke tahat karrwai kii gai he
 According to media reports, in the viral video, a man named Mangelal is alleging that the Congress government in Chhattisgarh is setting up with an inverter company
 iske liye inwarter company ne rajya sarkaar ko paisa diya he
 According to the agreement between the company and the government, if there is a power cut for 10 to 15 minutes in 2 hours, then the sales of inverters will increase
 video viral hone ke baad aaropee shaks ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 While giving the clarification, the power company said that due to storms and technical reasons, sometimes the power supply is stopped, which is being misled by the public by calling the name of power cuts as the connivance of the government and the power company
 bataa den ki ipisi kii dhara 124e ke tahat sarkaar virdohi afvaah failaane par aaajeevan jail yaa kam se kam teen saal kii sajaa ho sakati he

 Nitish Kumar's dream of becoming Prime Minister may have been broken, but Bihar's new Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi hopes that if the circumstances at the Center change and Nitish Kumar becomes Prime Minister, then his chair will continue even after the next election
 jeethanram maanjhi ne aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki wo sirf dedh saal ke liye hi mukhyamantri nahin he balki aglaa chunaav bhi unke netritv main ladaa ja saktaa he
 The proposal to contest elections under Nitish Kumar's leadership has been passed in view of the opposition of mlas and there is a lot of scope in view of the situation
 jeethanram maanjhi ne kaha ki aglaa chunaav unke hi netritv main hoga, kyonki wo jis tabake se aate hai wo tabaka party ke saath chattan kii tarah he or agar unke netritv main chunaav hua to party ko phayda hoga
 The new Chief Minister of Bihar, pointing to a new alliance with the RJD, said that there is no permanent friend and foe in politics and Nitish Kumar will take a decision in time
 jeethanram maanjhi ko narendra modi ne phonkar mukhyamantri banane kii badhai di thi or unhen modi ke shapath-grahan main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa bhi aayaa he, lekin shapath-grahan main shaamil hone par philhal koi faisla nahin hua he
 It is being said that you are the Chief Minister for one and a half years
 Do you also believe that you are the CM for one and a half years only or the next election will be fought under your leadership? Be the king for days but he left his mark, there is no time for one and a half years, i believe only one year, but the road map has been made, in that i will prove it but i have already said for further Further there is no ambition
 agar paristhitiyaan aise badale ki nitish ji kii desh ke pradhanmantri banane kii naubat aa jaae, vahaan chale jaaen to yahaan koi doosraa hoga to jeethanram maanjhi kaa naam bhi aa saktaa he
 Now the matter of the proposal in which Nitish Kumar has been proposed to be the next Chief Minister, then the circumstances were such that at that time our friends were very fierce that if they were not given a choice, then they would sit on a dharna for 2-3 days
 In fact, a proposal has come to keep the sentiment of mlas that he will be the next Chief Minister, so this proposal has come, but the proposal will change its entire scope
 yani dedh saal ke baad bhi agle chunaav ke baad bhi jeethanram maanjhi mukhyamantri rah sakate hai?cm:ye ham nahin kah sakate wo to vidhayak dal tay karegaa
 The election will be fought under your leadership? CM: Yes, there will be no opposition in my leadership because the people from which we come, are still sticking with this party like a rock and if we feel that our leadership If the party benefits from contesting in the state then it is certain that my leadership will remain
 kya aapkaa kaam karne kaa tarika alag hoga jisase aapaki apni pahchaan ban sake?cm:ye baat aisi he jise ham prachaarit nahin karnaa chaahate
 The moment you were told that you would be CM, you were expected
 
 ? CM: i neither expected it nor desired it
 ham to sirf vidhayak ke rup main kaam karnaa pasand karte rahe hai ye janata kaa yakeen he jo yahaan tak le ai
 It is a different matter that in order to become an MLA, he became a minister, he also became Chief Minister
 isaki naa to ummid thi naa prayaas tha, lekin jab netritv parivartan hua to ye saamaajik sameekaran kaa nateeja he
 Our experience and social equation worked on who would be the next Chief Minister in the same sequence
 aapako is baat kii ummid thi?cm:kabhi nahin, aapako kaha ki ek apeksha rahati he ki ham vidhayak bane,vidhayak ke baad mantri banate hai ki nahin, banate he to vibhaag miltaa he ki nahin
 We never thought of this, then where was the Chief Minister's question, but he definitely knew that if we get a chance, we will prove it
 aap sirf or sirf nitish kumaar kii pasand the kyonki kisi ko maaloom nahin tha ki aapkaa bhi naam aa saktaa he, aap kis tarah se dekhte hai,kitni sweekaaryata dekhte he party ke andar?cm:is baat ko ham bahut ahmiyat nahin dete, jo nirnay hota he nitish kumaar karte hai
 They have their own way of deciding, i am their personal choice, i do not believe that, they have done my name only with the most opinion, it is right they called us but the leaders were the same and the right to choose was also given by the mlas
 Was given to nitish ke rishte narendra modi se kaaphi kharaab rahe
 How will your relationship be with Modi? CM: See, no matter who the Prime Minister is, we have to seek help from the Center and there is no problem in talking to them and seeking cooperation
 agar wo bijepi kaa pradhanmantri banakar agenda chalaayenge to usase hamaara virodh hoga,wo agar teenon vivaadaaspad mudde uthaaenge to ham virodh karenge
 Do you consider Narendra Modi as a communal? CM: We hope that when Narendra Modi sits on the chair of justice, he will do justice to all
 modi ji sangh ke prachaarak rahe he lekin ham ummid karte hai ki wo sankuchit vichaar chhodkar desh hit main kaam karenge
 He is sworn in, have you been invited and will you go? CM: His invitation has come, considering the invitation two days ago, but no decision has been taken yet
 shapathgrahan ke baad unhone phone kar shubhakamanaayen di thi
 What will be your chemistry with RJD, you took their support from within the House, show you the overwhelming majority
 kya jise jangalraj aap kehete the or jo sushasan aap apana kehete the wo dono kahin na kahi aapse main mil rahaa he?cm:ye bhram aaplog failaa rahe he hamane unka samarthan liya kahaan, jaise hamen koi bahumat kii kami hoti,girane kii sthiti main hote tab na kisi ke yahaan jate, koi jarurat hi nahin thi
 We had a magic figure of 119
 hamaare paas 117 the, 2 nirdaleey,1 sipiai or 4 congress ke saath hamaare paas 124 kii sankhya thi, to kyon ham kisi se maangate
 In the countryside there is a saying that the person who has grain in his house gets only the punch
 unhone samarthan diya to ye unki apni soch he hamane to maanga nahin samarthan
 So will you ever get any support? Will there be no coalition, no support from RJD? CM: See, in politics no one is a friend and enemy of anyone, but if we give any support on ideology and principle, then we will support him, he decided to support the vote of confidence, then we Thanked kya bijepi ke khilaaf koi nayaa gathbandhan banaaenge jisame jedy-you or argedy bhi hogi?cm:isapar faisla nitish kumaar lenge
 Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh and his wife have been granted bail in case of disproportionate assets

 Patiala court ordered Virbhadra Singh to deposit a personal bond of one lakh and passport
 haalanki somvaar ko hui sunwaayee main sibiai ne court me unki jamaanat kaa virodh kiya tha
 The CBI argued in the court that they could influence the ongoing investigation and witnesses of the property case beyond the known sources of income

 In petitionsit has been said in the that the agency did not arrest the accused in the case while the investigation was going on
 yadi jamaanat par reeha kiya jaataa he to is baat kii koi gunjaaish nahin he ki aaropee gavaahon ko prabhavit karenge yaa jaanch baadhit karenge kyonki is prakaar kaa koi aarope nahin he ki unhone is maamle main pehle kabhi aisa kiya ho
 The final report filed under sections 109 (abetment) and 465 (punishment for forgery) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC for the alleged offense against Virbhadra and eight others, has placed 225 witnesses and 442 documents
 congress netaa or unki patni pratibha singh ke alaava report main chunni laal chouhan, joginder singh ghalta, prem raaj, vakamullah chandrashekhar, lavan kumaar roach or ram prakaash bhaatia ko aaropee banaaya gaya
 The next hearing of the case will be held on July 27
 agali taarikh se is maamle me virbhadra par aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle me trial chalegaa
 The CBI had registered a case against Virbhadra Singh in September 2015 in connection with disproportionate assets and corruption

 duniya ke dehshatgardon main jaise nafrat kii hadon se aage nikalne kii res lagi he
 Just two steps ahead of the day-to-day terrorist videos of ISIS, the world has been forced to press its fingers under the teeth by watching the acts of terrorists such as the Taliban and al-qaeda released the video
 in video main saream kisi kaa haath kaat dene se lekar pattharon se kuchal kar ladki ko maar daalane tak kii tasviren kaid hai
 From Afghanistan to Nigeria and from Nigeria to Kenya, it is hard to believe that seeing these pictures of these terrorists decorating the shops and terror shops, they too are residents of this world like you and us
 ye yakeen karnaa mushkil hota he ki inke bhi seene main insaan kaa dil dhadkta he? or ye yakeen karnaa mushkil hota he ki ye bhi aapaki or hamaari tarah hi insaan hai
 By living in the same world and breathing in this air, the terrorists of these terrorists are so different from us that there is probably no place for alphas like mercy and humanity
 tabhi to ye aatankwaadi kahin kisi ladki ko faqat shaadi se pehle kisi ladke se rishte rakhane ke iljaam main pattharon se maar-maar kar maut ke ghat utaar dete hai, to kahin kisi jode ke haath sirf isliye kaat kar alag kar dete hai ki un par chori kaa iljaam he or aisi vahashiana harkaton ko anjaam dene se pehle in aatankwaadiyon kii jo training hoti he, usamen wo bejubaan jaanwaron ko dauda-dauda kar maarthe or ghasitate hue najar aate hai
 Although the world has already seen a lot of ruthlessness due to these terrorists, but still these three pictures of the hardship that came from three different countries have revived the character of people
 upar se turra ye he ki nafrat or vahshat kii ye tasviren khud inhen aatankwaadiyon ne video kii surat main soshal media par jari kiye hai
 Three different stories of horror: Terrorists had already dug a pit at a deserted place in Ghor, Central Province, Afghanistan, and that girl was also present in the pit, who was stabbed to death in the blame of illegitimate relations
 Had to be lowered
 ladki ke haath-pair is tarah se bandhe the ki wo chaah kar bhi naa to khud ko aaazaad kar sakati thi or naa hi yahaan se bhaag sakati thi
 The local area commander of the Taliban first told the other terrorists present there about the crime of the girl in a loud voice and then ordered to be stabbed to death by crushing stones
 iske baad vahaan maujuud sabhi ke sabhi log jo karte hai, use dekh paanaa bhi mushkil he
 People attack the girl lying in a pit with stones
 dekhte hi dekhte us par chaaron ore se pattharon kii barish hone lagati he
 At first she screams, agonizes
 aatankwaadiyon or vahaan maujuud tamaam logon se raham kii bheekh maangati he lekin in aatankwaadiyon kii dictionari main shaayad raham jaisaa koi lafj hi nahin he
 So, all his screams and mercy are unheard and stones are thrown at him until he is fainted by every injury and then he does not die
 lekin isamen bhi ekahairaani kii baatye he ki jis ladkee ko is gunaah main maut kii aisi bhayanak sajaa di gai, uske mangetar ko usee gunaah main aatankwaadiyon ne sirf daant-fatkaar kar chhod diya
 What boko-haram has done to cross the border is more dangerous than what boko-haram has done to isis's new ally in Hidenigeria
 yahaan aatankwaadiyon ne baqayada ek adaalat lagaai, bagaiyr sunwaayee kiye mulgim ko mujrim qaraar diya or bagaiyr der kiye unke haath kaat daale
 In this court, a couple, who are accused of theft and who are not to be sentenced at this time, in the same charge, are presented before the terrorists, who have become judges themselves
 balki sabake saamne sajaa di bhi jaani he
 The punishment is to cut that hand apart in one stroke, which is the charge of stealing something
 chori kii aisi sajaa ke bare main sun kar yakeen karnaa bhi mushkil hota he lekin kya karen? yeatankwaadi or inkaa kanoonkuch aisa hi he
 The local commander of ISIS, Mike, takes hold of the two criminals by tying them in front of everyone and then begins to list their crimes by citing religious rules and regulations
 chunki is vakt is adaalat main aatankwaadiyon ke saath aas-paas kii ek badi aabaadi bhi maujuud he, kandhe par bandook taange ye aatankwaadi lage haath majahab, jehad or gunaah jaise masalon par lacture dena bhi nahin bhuulataa
 On the other hand, since the people of this area also know that what is going to happen in this court in the coming time, it is very strange and shocking
 tamaam log faisla or anjaam dekhne ke liye apni-apni jagah acchhee tarah jam jate hai
 First the sentence was handed over and then the hands were cut
 
 
 ab aatankwaadi pehle gunaah bataata he or phir lage haath sajaa bhi mukarrar karata he
 After this, he orders the other terrorists to execute the punishment and then on seeing the terrorist, one of the couple caught the man caught in the charge of theft
 chunki is adaalat main sajaa pehle se hi tay he, sajaa dene kaa intjaam bhi yahaan pehle se maujuud he
 And this is a sharp ax and a trunk of a tree kept for cutting hands
 aatankwaadi apane shikaar shaks kaa haath pakad kar usee tane ke upar rakh dete hai or phir ishaara milte hi kulhadi thame ek aatankwaadi jo kuch karata he, use dekhte hue log siharan se apni ankhen band kar lete hai
 In this video released by ISIS, terrorists have not released further photos of it
 lekin ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki iske aage kaa manjar kitna bhayanak or dardanaak he
 In fact, the terrorists keep the hands on the trunk and cut it off with an ax in one stroke and then leave it for some time to suffer in front of everyone
 isi iljaam main pakadi gai mahila ke liye to ye sajaa jaise or bhi zyada khaufnak he kyonki wo pehle to apane saathi ko milane vaali sajaa khud apni ankhon se dekhati he or thodi hi der baad khud use bhi usee sajaa se guzarana padataa he
 How is a picnic of terrorists? How do terrorists who shed blood of humans celebrate a picnic? The answer is simple
 
 
 bejubaanon kaa khun bahaakar
 The new video of al-qaeda recruits is something similar
 isamen puraane aatankwaadi nae rangaruton ko naa sirf jehad ke liye uksaa rahe hai, balki africa ke jangalon main unhen shikaar kii khuli chhot dekar bejubaan jaanwaron ke liye bhi maut kii vajah ban rahe hai
 Somewhere the freedom to openly shoot a giraffe, somewhere the freedom to target bison and somewhere to prepare for the feast after this hunt
 africa mulk somalia main al-kaayda ke aatankwaadi apane rangaruton ko jehad se judane or dehshat ke raste par chalane kaa kuch aisa hi inaam dene or dilaane kaa khwab dikhaa rahe hai
 While these pictures of al-qaeda's Somali unit, or Harkat al Shabaab, have shocked the whole world due to this barbaric treatment with animals, it has also proved how the terrorists are now joining the youth
 Has started greed for them
 jangalon main aatankiyon kii haivaaniyatvideo main ek aatankwaadi kenya or somalia ke jangalon main shikaar ke is chhot ko jihadiyon ko haq bataate hue ye kahata he ki allaah kii di hui har cheez jihadiyon kaa puraa haq he or yahaan unhen shikaar karne or jaanwaron ko maarane se koi nahin roak saktaa
 In this video released by Al Shabaab himself, where the old terrorists are seen motoring new recruits in the same way, they are also expressing sympathy to the terrorists who were killed in the military action
 bas saal bhar pehle kii baat he
 When the world first saw the plight of ISIS
 tab iesaiies apane dushmano kaa sir kalam unke video jari karata tha
 Then a few days later people were locked in a cage and burnt alive
 alam ye he ki har guzarate din ke saath ab wo pehle se bhi zyada krur hota ja rahaa he
 How long will this cycle last? The process of killing hostages in Iraq and Syria since August 21, 2014 has continued till today
 in donon deshon memm pichley 10 maheenon se katleam chal rahaa he
 No one knows the exact count of the dead bodies, and no one can even tell when the terrorists who have been isolated from Baghdadi will stop
 donon deshon ke registani ilaakon kii tapati ret par insaanon kii laashen milanaa rosemara kii baat ho chali he
 The question is still the same, how long this video and the process of killing innocent people will continue to happen and how long the ISIS terrorists will continue to haunt the world

 Kamleshwar, one of the most famous storytellers of our times, wrote the lines as the third edition of his novel Kisane Pakistan
 yah ek sanyog hi he ki kamaleshwar kaa janm or mrityu donon hi janvari main hue
 He was born in Mainpuri, Uttar Pradesh, the date was January 6, 1932
 nidhan kii taarikh thi 27 janvari, 2007 or ghar kaa pataa tha nai dilli ke surajkund road kaa iroj garden
 Kamleshwar was a brilliant storyteller and a very good human being
 unhone bahuton kii madad kii or koi agar thodaa sa bhi parichit ho, to jab bhi miltaa to khulkar milte the
 Delhi, Mumbai, Uttar Pradesh Is there any such journalist and narrator of the entire Hindi belt who has not met Kamleshwar in his lifetime
 unke sneh kaa alam yah tha ki kathakaar arun prakaash ne kamaleshwar ke kehane par apni sarkari naukari tak chhod di thi, vah bhi ek akhbaar main unke saath kaam karne bhar ke liye
 Kamleshwar was the whole meeting man and friend of friends
 chuhalbaji unhen pasand thi, par dusron ke saath
 He himself would mischief others, but try not to do the same to others
 iske liye vah upar se apneaap ko bada sakht dikhaate
 But it is not necessary that the person can do whatever he wants
 prasiddh gazalkaar dushyant kumaar unke samadhi the, so unke saath vah chuhal karne se baj nahin aate
 The stories of the mischief of Mohan Rakesh and Rajendra Yadav's friend-trio were very popular in the literary world
 par kuch aise bhi kisse hai, jo in doston se itar hamaari peedi se jude the, or dimag par abhi bhi chaspa hai
 Some things are related to him directly, some were heard by his very close people, but now that it has been a long time since he had gone to Kamleshwar, then there is an anecdote of Prank, who was also an eyewitness, mention me here
 i will give hindi ke ab kaaphi sthapit ho chuke aalochak, patrkaar mitra un dinon yuva the, or ek production house se judi saahitiyik sarokaaron vaali patrika se jude the
 i would also occasionally help him with the smooth publication of the magazine
 vah mobile vaala jamaana nahin tha, na hi phone par collar idi hoti thi
 One night, as the preparations for the release of the magazine were in full swing, my friend suddenly felt the heat and he called Kamleshwar's house at four in the morning
 kaaphi der ghanti bajane par udhar se unindi aawaaj main kamaleshwar kii patni gayatri kamaleshwar kii aawaaj sunai di
 She would say hello that from here the critic friend suddenly started speaking English in British accent and said 'I want to talk to Mr
 Kamleshwar
 unhen landan ke ek bade saahitiyik kaarykram main bulaanaa he
 Gayatri Kamleshwar asked, 'now? This time of night? ' He got the answer- 'yes'
 khayr paanch minute baad unhone phir se phone karne kii baat kahi, taaki vah kamaleshwar ko jagaa saken
 Five minutes later, when the phone rang, Kamleshwar picked up the phone
 unka pehla ulaahna tha ki ‘kisi ko aamantrit karne kaa yah kya tarika he? kya unhen yah nahin lagata ki yah uchit samay nahin he
 It is dawn in India now
 idhar se jawaab mila, ‘aapane khud hi aaj se saat-aath saal pehle tems ke kinare tahaltey hue kaha tha ki aap subah chaar baje uth jate hai
 On hearing this, Kamleshwar fell silent for a while
 shaayad unhone apni yaaddaasht par jor daalane kii koshish kii
 But having missed nothing, asked again, 'did i tell you myself about waking up in the morning?' On answering 'yes', his answer was,' No, you must have misunderstood to hear
 main aisa kah hi nahin saktaa
 i don't wake up before seven o'clock
 ’ham spikar par unki aawaaj sun rahe the
 Our collective laughed, but before that their phone was disconnected
 kamaleshwar ji chale gaye, par is prank kaa pataa unhen kabhi na chalaa
 In fact, his personality was such that even if he did not dare to reveal it
 kamaleshwar ne hameshaa raja kii tarah jindagi ji
 Like other Hindi writers, he never had money problems

 Eventually the winter session of Parliament came to an end

 Six more bills were passed in the Lok Sabha
 rajyasabha ke dhang se na chalane kii vajah se sarkaar ke das karod rupye barabaad ho gaye 
 The Rajya Sabha was to have 112 hours of work, but 55 hours were wasted due to the uproar
 satr kii khaas baat rahi ki pichley chaar satr se loksabhaa main rajyasabha kii tulana main zyada kaam hua
 The Rajya Sabha gave less time to debate the bill and six bills were passed without debate
 prashnkaal ke dauraan 14 mantriyon ne tarankit sawaal kaa jabaab bolkar nahin die
 Although 14 bills were to be introduced in the winter session but only eight were introduced

 During the Question Hour, 14 Ministers did not respond to the starred question
 vaise to sheetakaaleen satr main 14 bill pesh kiye jane the lekin aath hi pesh hue
 Not only this, there were plans to pass 20 bills but only eight happened
