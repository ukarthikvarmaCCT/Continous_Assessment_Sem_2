 The 2015 Cricket World Cup begins in the semi-finals starting on Tuesday and two big teams are ready to play in it
 oakland main host newjiland banaam dakshin africa ke bich khelaa jayega yah mahamuqabla
 While New Zealand knocked out West Indies in the quarter-finals with Martin Guptill's historic unbeaten 237, South Africa tried to remove the tag of 'chokers' to some extent by showing Sri Lanka a 9-wicket exit
 2015 world cap main donon tiimon kaa pradarshnavanade main newjiland ke sabase safal captain stephen fleming ne guptil kii is pari ko newjiland cricket itihaas kii mahanatam pari qaraar diya
 Guptill, thanks to this innings, has now become the batsman (number-2 after Sangakkara in overall) for the most runs (498) among the cricketers of the teams that reached the semi-finals of this tournament
 toornament main captain brendan makkulam kaa balla bhi lagaataar garajtaa rahaa he
 At the same time, Kiwi bowlers have dominated this tournament from the very beginning
 gendbaajon ke shandaar pradarshan kii badaulat hi kiwi team ne khele gaye saat maichon main 67 vicketen leen, bharat ke baad is toornament main sabase zyada wicket lene vaali team
 In all, almost all the players in the New Zealand team who have won seven consecutive matches in this tournament have returned to form
 duusari ore dakshin africa toornament main do match haar chukaa he lekin uske captain di'williars (417 ran), hashim amala (323 ran) or du-plasis (298 ran) banaakar shandaar form main hai
 They have bowlers like Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel whose bowling has become a problem for even the biggest batsmen
 yani wo kisi bhi batting order ko nestnabud kar sakate hai
 nzvssa: What do the figures say? There have been a total of six matches between these two teams in the World Cup so far
 isamen se newjiland ne chaar jabaki africa team ne do jite hai
 But if we talk about ODI cricket then the lion here is South Africa
 donon tiimon ke bich kul 61 vanade mukaable hue hai
 Of these, 36 South Africans won, only 20 came to New Zealand's account
 2014 main in donon tiimon ke bich hue teen muqablon main se dakshin africa team ne do match jite jabaki ek barish kii vajah se radd ho gaya tha
 That is, in terms of statistics, the pan is the weight of the South African team
 world cap semifinal main pradarshandakshin africa team par laga chokars tag to sarvavidit hai lekin yahaan newjiland ko bhi isi catagori main rakhana chahta hum kyonki ye to africa se bhi bade ‚Äòchokars‚Äô hai
 While the South African team has been eliminated in the semi-finals of the World Cup three times, New Zealand has done it exactly six times
 africa team 1992 main england se to 1999 or 2007 main champion australiya se haari
 On the other hand, the team from New Zealand reached the semi-finals six times since 1975 but could never play the final
 1975, 1979, 1992 or 1996 ke baad newjiland kaa world cap main yah lagaataar teesraa or kul milakar saatvaan semifinal (2007, 2011 or 2015) muqabla he
 New Zealand have been eliminated in the semi-finals of the tournament, losing to champions West Indies in 1975, England to 1979, champions Pakistan to 1992, 1999 to Pakistan once again, Sri Lanka in 2007 and Australia in 2011
 behad romaanchak hoga muqablawaise jo ek kaaran cricket ko khaas banaata he wo iske mukaable kii prakruti kaa anishchit hona he
 This means that how the teams are playing on match day, it matters the most for the win and not what the figures were between the teams playing earlier
 newjiland ke coach mike hesan bhi isse ittefaq rakhte hai
 "we are all looking forward to a place in the finals and i think this semi-final match will be very exciting
" donon timen acha cricket khel rahi hai or kadaa muqabla dekhne ko milegaa
 'the only concern for New Zealand is the exit of fast bowler Adam Milne due to a heel injury
 unki jagah yuva tej gendbaaj mat henry ko team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 This will be the last match to be hosted by New Zealand in the current World Cup, with the team winning, the neighboring country will want to play the final for the first time in Australia but there will be a different pressure on the team in the presence of their home audience
 newjiland kaa trek record bataata he ki use kabhi prabal daavedaar nahin mana gaya lekin uske saath khel rahi team bhi ‚Äòchokars‚Äô thappe ke saath khelti rahi he or agar is baar bhi nahin jeet saki to yah tag usapar yathaavat bana rahegaa
 It is very difficult to guess who will be the winner of the match
 lekin isaki ummid jarur he ki donon tiimon ke bich is mukaable main romaanch apane charam par hoga
 So it will be decided in a while that who will reach the finals for the first time by becoming the winner of this match of these two big 'chokers'
 timen is prakaar hai:newjiland: brendan makkulam (captain), kori anderson, trent bolt, grant iliyat, martin guptil, tom latham, mishael maclenaghan, nathan makkulam, kyle mills, luk ronchi, tim southi, ross tailor, danniel vittori, ken williamsan or mat henry
 South Africa: AB d'villiers (captain), Hashim Amla, Kyle Abbott, Farhan Behardine, Quinton de Cock, JP Duminy, Faf du-plessis, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Fangiso, Vernon Philander, Riley Rousseau and Dale Steyn

 In the midst of the ongoing political crisis in Tamil Nadu, for the first time, a big minister at the Center has made a big statement
 kendriya mantri vankeya naidu kaa kahana he ki governor vidyasagar raav apana kaam kar rahe hai
 Naidu said that while you are writing a letter to the governor, no one should be accused of acting with vested interest
 vah bahut hi nishpaksh dhang se vyavhaar kar rahe hai or apana kartavya nirvahan kar rahe hai
 cm's post is not empty, he said that there is no vacant post of Chief Minister which has to be filled because there is already a government headed by a Chief Minister
 naidu bole ki tathy yah he kipaniraselvam, madam (jayalalita)ke dauraan bhi mukhyamantri chune gaye the
 Subsequently, AIADMK leaders themselves made him Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki main unka koi pairvikar nahin ki unki ore se samajhaau, naidu ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki bhaajapa ke paas tamilnadu vidhansabha main koi sadsy nahin he or party ke liye vahaan sarkaar banane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 "we are not preparing any ground that this is their internal matter," he said
 shashikala banaam panniraselvamravivaar ko shashikala ke sabhi vidhayakon ko media ke saamne pesh karne or yah daawa karne kii vah aaazaad hai unpar kisi bhi tarah kaa koi dabaav nahin he

 vahiin police kaa istemaal kar vidhayakon ko chhudaane ke sawaal par panniraselvam bole ki is tarah kaa faisla kisi bhi buree sthiti ko paidaa kar saktaa he
 Earlier, on reports related to AIADMK mlas being held hostage at a resort on the outskirts of the city, party chief Sasikala said that these were lies and news spread by rebels and rivals
 unhone kaha ki vidhayak apni party or sarkaar ko banaae rakhane ke paksh main swatantra or patibaddh hai

 goa ke baahar bharat ke kisi kone main rahane vaale un logon ke sampatti ke adhikaar bhi portugali civil code ke tahat nirdhaarit hote hai, jo goa ke bascindia hai
 Muslims cannot give divorce in Goa without court permission
 During this time, the Supreme Court also praised the provisions of the Goa Civil Code, under which husband and wife are given equal rights in property before and after marriage
 goa main musalamaanon ko bahuvivaah or bolkar talaak dene kii ijaajat nahin hai
 This means that no Muslim can divorce his wife himself
 agar usko apni patni ko talaak dena he, to court janaa hoga
 Divorce occurs only on court order

 In the last one year, this issue has emerged as the biggest issue of politics

 But this decision was openly welcomed by some people

 But actor-turned-politician South superstar Kamal Haasan recently apologized for supporting demonetisation
 hasan ne kaha tha ki unhone jaldbaaji main aakar notebandi kaa samarthan kar diya tha, lekin ab vah iske liye maafee maangate hai

 ye tex peyars ke liye bada kadam he
 Now where did i turn? But after a year Kamal Haasan wrote in the article, many of my colleagues explained to me after giving my support
 jiske baad mujhe mahasoos hua ki bhale hi plan acha tha, lekin use sahi tareeke se lagu nahin kiya gaya
 PM also ask for apology: If PM Modi is ready to apologize for this mistake, i will salute him one more time

 unhone kaha, stuart binni ko baahar karke paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko antim ekadash main rakhana chahie
 Gavaskar said that swing bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar should be kept in the team, as the team needs to take 20 wickets to win the Test
 unhone kaha, 'yah nirnaayak test he or yadi aap jeetna chaahate ho to aapako 20 wicket lene honge
 For this, India should hire five specialist bowlers
 yadi pich main kuch ghaas chhod di jaati he jaisi ki sambhaavna he to phir main chaahunga ki bhubaneshwar ko team main rakhaa jaae kyonki is tarah kii paristhitiyon main 20 wicket lene ke liye aapako swing gendbaaj kii jarurat padati he
 ' is purv captain ne kaha, 'stuart kaa puraa sammaan karte hue meraa maananaa he ki vah ek pari main paanch wicket lene vaala gendbaaj nahin he
 He played well in the second Test, but could not bowl accurately
 ' sinhalaij sports club kii pich main kuch ghaas hone kii sambhaavna he
 Gavaskar told NDTV about this, 'indian spinners did very well against the Sri Lankan batsmen
 unke spinneron main keval rangana herath hi pehle test match main acha pradarshan kar paye the
 Comments murali vijay or riddhimaan saaha ke chotil hone ke kaaran bharat do nae khilaadiyon ko utaaregaa, lekin gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki srilanka kii sthiti bhartiya team se badtar he, kyonki use kumaar sangakaara kii kami khalegi
 He said, 'sangakkara was a big player and there is no good option to fill his place
 vah haalanki siries main acha pradarshan nahin kar paae, lekin team or dressing room main unki upasthiti kii kami khalegi
 The Sri Lankan team lacks experience and most of its players, except Angelo Mathews, have played very few Test games
 ' Gavaskar said, "on the other hand, there is not much problem in India's batting and bowling
 ve doosraa test match jitkar aatmavishvaas se bhare hai
 Gavaskar was asked what his message would be for Cheteshwar Pujara if he was selected in the playing XI, adding, "he should take full advantage of this opportunity
" ab gend unke paale main hogi
 Pujara is also a player like Rahane who does not complain and is ready to play at any position
 main use shubhakamana detaa hum
 ' gavaskar ne kaha ki swing gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar ko team main rakhaa janaa chahie, kyonki team ko test jeetne ke liye 20 wicket lene kii jarurat he
 He said, 'this is a decisive Test and if you want to win, you have to take 20 wickets
 iske liye bharat ko paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko rakhana chahie
 If there is some grass left in the pitch as is the possibility, then i would like to put Bhubaneswar in the team because in such circumstances you need a swing bowler to take 20 wickets
 ' The former captain said, 'I fully respect Stuart, i believe that he is not a bowler taking five wickets in an innings
 usne duusare test main acchhee bhoomika nibhaai, lekin sateek gendbaaji nahin kar paaya
 There is likely to be some grass in the Sinhalese Sports Club pitch

 Among his spinners, only Rangana Herath did well in the first Test
 ' tippaniyan India will field two new players due to injuries to Murali Vijay and Wriddhiman Saha, but Gavaskar believes Sri Lanka's situation is worse than the Indian team, as they will miss Kumar Sangakkara
 unhone kaha, 'sangakaara bahut bada khilaadi tha or unki jagah bharne ke liye koi acha vikalp nahin he
 Although he did not do well in the series, he would miss his presence in the team and the dressing room

 This is a month which will decide the turn of politics of the state
 sabase zyada suspence nitish kumaar, lalu yadav or congress party ke bich siton ke talmail ko lekar he
 Now that it is being decided that these three parties will go to the electoral arena together, then the joint electoral assembly or worker conference of the three parties is just stuck on when the negotiation of seats starts and when it will end
 sabase bada pench is baat ko lekar he ki aakhir teenon dal kitni siton par chunaav ladenge or iskaa formula yaa aadhaar kya hoga
 The Rashtriya Janata Dal will make every effort not to ignore the results of the last Lok Sabha elections on the seat-sharing, especially the results of the assembly
 or yahaan par unka tark hoga ki agar rashtriya janata dal ko sammanjanak siten nahin milengi tab yadav votaron main asantosh ho saktaa he
 On the other hand, Janata Dal United will argue on the basis of seats on the basis of the 2010 election result, because then it will not only contest more than 100 seats but will also send a message to its voters that after all Nitish Kumar's tutti is still speaking in the alliance
 congress party kaa prayaas hoga ki use adhik se adhik siten milen or manamafik siton kii sankhya ho yaa nahin lekin jo siten milen usase jeetne main use bahut zyada mushkilon kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 But it all depends on how much Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar give priority to seat coordination

 However, this month, three rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi are also to be held in Bihar, so under the garb of these rallies, for the time being, they will try to avoid the issue of talks on seats
 tippaniyan But BJP strategists are satisfied that every ally in their alliance has the ability to transfer their votes and like Lalu Yadav, they should not worry about their base vote being in the field of rebel candidates

 input:ians Whether it is considered superstition or something else, in the ordinary days, the appearance of 'crow' on the rag of the house, the Bundeli inauspicious, repudiates them as 'handi', a fortnight in the patriarchal side by establishing a relationship of these crows with 'dai-baba'
 In the Shraddh of the ancestors, 'kaua Bhoj' is organized
 logon kaa maananaa he ki purvaj kaua kaa bhi janm le sakate hai or 'kaua bhoj' se purakhon ko moksh kii prapti hogi
 
 
 Where 'crows' are invited to Shraddha, many such old traditions are still going on in Bundelkhand, which point towards superstition
 ab aap pitrupaksh main purvajon ke liye kiye jane vaale shraadh ko hi le lijie
 In normal days, the residents of the crow consider the sitting of the crow on the doorpost or tile of the house to be inauspicious and shun it by calling it 'hari', but in a fortnightly paternal journey, it is from these crows that 'dai-baba' (dada- Dadi's relationship has been established and has been organizing till his crow's feast
 saalon se kar rahaa he paraayon kaa pindadanbujurg logon kaa maananaa he ki purvaj kaua kaa bhi janm le sakate hai, kauwon ko bhojan karaane se purakhon ko moksh kii prapti hoti he or jaldi hi unka maanav ke rup main janm bhi ho jaataa he
 The special thing is that on the eve of Shraddh, the elderly lady of the house with a loud voice from her courtyard invites 'dai-baba' to join the banquet and the same lady will make many kinds of dishes on the morning of the Shraddha and keep it on the rag
 Are, whom crow arrived in the herd eat
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki bundelkhand main gangaparee kam or saamaanya prajati ke kaua zyada paae jate hai, agar shraadh ke din ek bhi gangaparee kaua is bhoj main shaamil ho gaya to us parivaar ke sadsy isliye behad khush hote hai ki unka purvaj moksh praapt kar waapas aayaa he
 Shraddha and Tarpan to get rid of diseases Not to mention, but there are crowds in 84 lakh vaginas
 karmo ke aadhaar par aglaa janm hona bataaya jaataa he, ho saktaa he ki kisi kaa purvaj kaua yoni main janm le liya ho
 He explains that the tradition of performing charity and feast is going on on the day of Shraddha, so this bird is also invited
 pitrupaksh par mahashubh sanyog, milegi dosha se muktiisi gaanv kii pichde varg kii bujurg mahila sahadeia (78) bataati hai ki vah apane purvajon ke shraadh main kai saal se kauwon ko bhoj main aamantrit karti ai he, yah parampara kab or kaise shuru hui use nahin maaloom lekin shikshit varg is parampara ko bakawaas or andhvishwaas maanata he
 Balaram Dixit of the same village says that non-educated societies have imputed traditions of meaninglessness, which have no social intent
 maranoparant kiskaa janm kahaan or kis rup main hua, kisi ko pataa nahin he
 It may be a tradition associated with superstition, but in Bundelkhand, both the educated and non-educated class of ancestors do this unique feast

 By the way, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is at number 10 in the list of captains in most Test matches, but after Graeme Smith at the top, there are eight such players in the list who have retired, so, Smith's record is broken
 Almost impossible, as Dhoni will also be able to remain the Indian captain in 56 more Tests, it seems doubtful
 
 
 khayr, greem smith ne captain ke rup main 109 match khele, jinamein se 53 main unhone jeet hasil kii, or 28 match haare, jabaki 27 match drow rahe
 
 
 (the result of the final match is yet to come
 
 
 ) so, is lihaaz se jeet kaa unka pratishat 48
 62, which is quite impressive
 
 
 haalanki, dhoni kaa jeet pratishat greem smith ke mukaable behatar he
 
 
 Of the 53 matches that Dhoni has led Team India so far, 26 have been won by Indians, and 14 have lost, while 13 have been drawn
 
 
 is lihaaz se mahendra singh dhoni ne apane captaini kariyar main 49
 05 percent won matches
 
 
 haalanki jeet pratishat ke lihaaz se suchi main pehle 10 sthanon par darj captainon main sabase shandaar australia ke steve wa rahe, jinhone 71
 Won 92 percent of Test matches
 
 
 steve wa ne kul 57 maichon main captaini kii, jinamein se 41 main vah jite, nau match haare, or saat match drow hue
 
 
 By the way, Steve Waugh is sixth on the list of captains in most matches
 
 
 jeet pratishat ke lihaaz se suchi main doosraa sthaan he australia ke hi riki ponting kaa, jinhone 77 maichon main captain rahakar 48 main jeet hasil kii, or 16 haare
 
 
 In this sense, Ricky Ponting 62, who managed to draw 13 matches as captain
 33 pratishat maichon main jite
 
 
 By the way, Ricky Ponting is fourth on the list of captains in most matches
 
 
 is suchi main doosraa sthaan he australia ke hi alan border kaa, jinhone 93 maichon main team kii kaman sanbhali, 32 match jite, 22 main haar kaa saamana kiya, or 38 match drow rahe
 
 
 Alan Border's account also includes a tie test match
 
 
 unka jeet pratishat 34
 Has been 40
 
 
 sabase zyaada maichon main captaini karne waalon kii suchi main tisare number par darj hai, newjiland ke stephen fleming, jinhone 80 maichon main captaini kar 28 main jeet darj kii, or 27 main shikast jheli
 
 
 The Kiwi team drew 25 Test matches under Fleming's captaincy, with a winning percentage of 35
 
 
 paanchaven sthaan par west indies ke diggaj clive loyad kaa naam darj he, jo 74 maichon main carabian team ke captain rahe, or 36 main jite
 
 
 He suffered defeat in 12 matches, while he managed to draw 26 matches
 
 
 clive loyad kaa jeet pratishat 48
 64 remained
 
 
 saatven sthaan par srilanka ke arjuna rantunga hai, jo 56 test maichon main captain rahe
 
 
 Of these, his team won 12 matches, and lost 19
 
 
 rantunga kii captaini main srilankai team ne 25 test match drow bhi karwaae, or is lihaaz se arjuna rantunga kaa jeet pratishat 21
 Has been 42
 
 
 sabase zyaada maichon main captaini karne waalon kii suchi main aathven number par englad ke maaikel ethraton hai, jinhone 54 maichon main angrezon kii bagdor sanbhali
 
 
 In 13 of these 54 matches, the British won, while in 21 they lost
 
 
 ethraton kii captaini main 20 test match drow bhi rahe, or unka jeet pratishat 24
 07
 
 
 tippaniyan Ranked ninth in the list is the late South African captain Hansie Cronje, who, like Dhoni, captained 53 matches, but could lead his team to one win more than Dhoni under his leadership
 
 
 unhone captain ke rup main kul 27 maichon main jeet hasil kii, 11 haare, or 15 ko drow karwaane main kaamyaab rahe
 
 
 So, Hansie Cronje's win percentage 50
 94 par dhoni se kuch behatar he
 
 
 However, it is now quite clear that the player with whom this conversation began, that is, South African captain Graeme Smith, will probably always have the most world record to captain his team in Test matches
 
 
 vaise, sabase zyaada test maichon main captaini karne waalon kii suchi main mahendra singh dhoni 10wein number par hai, lekin sheersh par maujuud greem smith ke baad suchi main aath aise khilaadi darj hai, jo ritair ho chuke hai, so, smith kaa yah record tootna lagbhag asambhav he, kyonki dhoni bhi 56 or test maichon main bhartiya captain rah paaenge, yah sandigdh lagata he
 
 
 Well, Graeme Smith played 109 matches as captain, out of which he won 53, and lost 28 matches, while 27 matches were drawn
 
 
 (antim match kaa parinaam abhi aana baaki he
 
 
 ) So his percentage of victory in this regard is 48
 62 he, jo kaaphi shandaar he
 
 
 However, Dhoni's win percentage is better than Graeme Smith's
 
 
 dhoni ne ab tak jin 53 maichon main team india kaa netritv kiya he, unamem se 26 main bhartiya jite hai, or 14 main shikast jheli he, jabaki 13 match drow bhi rahe hai
 
 
 In this sense, Mahendra Singh Dhoni 49 in his captaincy career
 05 pratishat match jite
 
 
 However in terms of win percentage, the most outstanding of the captains who entered the first 10 places in the list was Australia's Steve Waugh, 71
 92 pratishat test maichon main jeet darj kii
 
 
 Steve Waugh captained a total of 57 matches, of which he won 41, lost nine, and drew seven

 12 maichon main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jabaki vah 26 maichon ko drow karwaane main kaamyaab rahe
 
 
 Clive Lloyd's win percentage of 48
 64 rahaa
 
 
 In seventh place is Sri Lanka's Arjuna Ranatunga, who captained 56 Tests
 
 
 inamen se unki team ne 12 maichon main jeet darj kii, or 19 haare
 
 
 The Sri Lankan team, under Ranatunga's captaincy, also drew 25 Test matches, and thus Arjuna Ranatunga's win percentage of 21
 42 rahaa he
 
 
 England's Michael Atherton is at number eight on the list of captains in most matches, who took the reins of the British in 54 matches
 
 
 in 54 main se 13 maichon main angrez jite, jabaki 21 main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 
 
 Atherton also captained 20 Test matches, and his winning percentage was 24

 The comments suchi main nauven sthaan par dakshin africa ke divangat captain hansee kronye kaa naam darj he, jinhone dhoni kii hi tarah 53 maichon main captaini kii, lekin vah apane netritv main apni team ko dhoni kii tulana main ek jeet zyaada dilava sake
 
 
 As captain, he won a total of 27 matches, lost 11, and managed to draw 15
 
 
 so, hansee kronye kaa jeet pratishat 50
 Something better than Dhoni at 94
 
 
 baharhaal, ab yah bilkul spasht he ki jis khilaadi se yah baat shuru hui thi, yani dakshin africa captain greem smith, uskaa sabase zyaada test maichon main apni team kii captaini karne kaa vishwarecord sambhawatah hameshaa hi bana rahegaa

 Is Bihar's former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi going to become a burden for the BJP? It seems like the kind of statements that are coming from Manjhi after he became a formal part of the NDA alliance in the Bihar assembly elections
 1
 One day, Manjhi said that the NDA should not declare a chief ministerial candidate but it should be decided according to the seats after the elections
 haalanki, baad main maanjhi ne kah diya ki unhen endie kaa mukhyamantri manjuur hoga
 So does Manjhi indirectly want to start a debate about the Chief Ministerial candidate in NDA
 aisa lagata he maanjhi chaahate hai ki ye bahes aage bade phir wo bataaen ki ek daavedaar to wo bhi hai
 If this is so, then it is difficult to say how long the relationship will be
 2
 If we look at Manjhi's statements, it seems that he has only one mission - cm's chair
 wo baat bhale kuch bhi karen lekin gum-phir kar wo baat mukhyamantri pad kii hi karne lagate hai
 Whether it is the matter of going with Lalu Prasad or the matter of reconnecting with Nitish, Manjhi is seen every time seeing himself as the Chief Minister

 Shrey and Abhishek, sons of Uttar Pradesh Inspector Subodh Singh, who were killed in the Bulandshahr violence, in a special conversation till date have expressed suspicion of a big conspiracy behind the death of their father
 inspector subodh singh ke bacchon kaa kahana he ki 3 disambar ko ek bade sampradayik tanaav ko failaane kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi thi, jiskaa virodh karne or use rokane ke chalate unke pita ko shikaar banaaya gaya
 Subodh Singh's son Shrey said, "the system is serious as it is not a minor incident but some big conspiracy
" jisaki kai baaten missing hai or jinako jaldi jodne kii jarurat he, jisase sach saamne aa sake
 At the same time, Abhishek said that when father was killed and he was fired, how did his car burn? Why was there no police on the spot and when they were rushed to the hospital, how was the scene of chance-a-crime left empty? Abhishek said that there was a conspiracy behind it
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki govansh katkar khule kheton main chhod diya jaae
 This can happen only if the cow dynasty is cut off so that other people get to know and cause a stir
 shrey ne kaha, driver ne ghatnakram sabase pehle bataaya tha
 He is claiming that stones were being hurled from all sides
 jabapattharbajizyada ho gai to wo gaadi chhodkar bhaag gaya
 Shrey said that his father had no personal enmity with anyone but the pressure was visible on his face
 inspector subodh ne gohatya ke aaropee ko kiya tha giraftaavbhishek ne kaha ki pitaaji kaa kaam karne kaa tarika alag tha
 He used to go to the bottom of everything and he was not keeping pace with many senior officials here
 abhishek ne bataaya ki 3 disambar ko hue hatyakand se kuch din pehle hi unke pita yani inspector subodh ne kuch logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, jo gohatya ke maamle main aaropee the
 In this case, Inspector Subodh was suppressed and the arrested person got bail
 abhishek ne bataaya ki tab unhone (subodh) ne bataaya tha ki us aaropee ne kaha tha, iskaa anjaam bura hoga
 Abhishek said that its record would also be recorded with the police as the arrest was made on the charge of cow slaughter and the person who was caught threatened the father (inspector Subodh)
 shrey ne kaha ki agar puure ghatnakram ko dekhen to samaj main aayega ki is ghatnakram main mere pitaaji ko shikaar banaaya gaya he
 Abhishek said that locally there was pressure on Dad
 sthaneey vidhayak ne kah diya ki unki hatya nahin hui balki heart atake aayaa tha
 In such a situation, he can also change the post-mortem report, the person who is accused will say something in his explanation
 shrey ne kaha ki mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sangyaan lete hue kaha tha ki sari kadiyaan jodi jaaengi
 He also said that all the people who are making rhetoric are being taken cognizance of all those things
 abhishek ne kaha, linching ek durghatana kaise hui ki ek police vaale ko goli maar di gai
 If the Chief Minister is calling this an accident, then he must be speaking under a report, show that report
 abhishek ne kaha, prashasan ko yah lagata he ki gohatya ke jo kaatil hai, agar vah mil jaaen to unase mere pitaaji ke kaatil mil jaaenge
 But we have to know whether it is more important to know about the slayer of a cow slaughter or to know how a person has died? Shrey said that there are some people whose names are registered in the FIR and who are the main accused
 , But have not been caught
 agar video nikaalkar khud ko nirdosh sabit kar rahe hai to saamne kyon nahin aa rahe or vah bhaag kyon rahe hai? agar unhen koi bachaa rahaa he to meraa maananaa he ki police pakad kar rahegi
 Abhishek said that we think this is a kind of conspiracy to try to create a hindu-muslim dispute
 jis din yah ghatana hui tab ek taraf ijatama tha or duusari taraf hinsa bhadak gai
 Dad (inspector Subodh) tried to calm the violence
 ho saktaa he ki kisi ne baat badhaane kii thaan lee ho or isliye unhen maar diya ho
 Abhishek said that father never wanted violence, he could only do welfare of society if peace prevails
 unhone sikhaaya he ki achche naagarik banie
 All castes, religions are the same, the holy Quran is as much as the Holy Quran
 abhishek ne kaha ki gohatya kii shikaayat par kuch karrwai ho rahi thi, lekin jo aag main chingaari daalane vaale log the vah achaanak vahaan aa gaye
 Everything has happened under a well thought out conspiracy, because it is not possible that a small action has become such a big violence

 Mukul Roy, who was close to the chief minister for a long time and recently switched to BJP, has revealed a big secret that the Vishwa Bangla logo, which is used to promote Bengal and promote government programs, is allegedly It belongs to Abhishek and not to the state government as people have understood
 roy kaa aarope he ki fifa under-17 ke final, jiskaa aayojan or prachaar vishwa bangla logo kaa istemaal karte hue rajya sarkaar kii ore se kolkata main kiya gaya tha, kaa praayojan darasal gupt rup se abhishek kii ek company kii ore se kiya gaya tha
 These allegations have made public the long-running tussle between Abhishek and the state government over the ownership of the people
 2013 main emsamai (sookshm, laghu or madhyam upakramon) ke ek kaarykram se pehle khud mamata banerjee kaa dizin kiya hua vishwa bangla logo shby akshar ko dikhaata he, yani bangla kaa pehla akshar
 But even before the government could register it with the Registrar of Trademarks, Abhishek allegedly claimed ownership of the logo through eight applications submitted through a firm named CJ Associates
 is maamle main suchit kiye jane ke baad mamata ne disambar, 2014 main emsamai or kapadaa vibhaagon ko rajya sarkaar kaa ek upkram vishwa bangla marketing korporation (bibiemasi) kaa gathan karavaaya
 This venture was also approved to use the controversial logo
 bibiemasi ne logo par daawa karte hue ek aavedan jamaa kiya lekin daavon kii pratispardhaa ko dekhte hue uskaa aavedan khaarij ho gaya
 In January 2015, Abhishek filed a petition in the trademark examiner's office seeking publication of his ownership status in trademark magazines
 satta ke galiyaaron main abhishek ke rutabe ko dekhte hue bibiemasi ne 2015 main register of trademark kii noticeon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Coming into action in September this year after Abhishek was described as the owner of the logo in the trademark magazines, the state government filed a petition in the concerned department stating that the applicant (abhishek) had a logo with the same symbol 'with the intention of wrong and dishonest'
 Had applied for registration of
 yachika main yah bhi bataaya gaya ki sarkaar is logo kaa kaaphi istemaal karti rahi he or iske prachaar par kaaphi rakam kharch kar chuki he
 Any ownership of the Abhishek Vishwa Bangla logo by getting ownership, including p
 bengal sarkaar bhi shaamil he, par 10 pratishat roylty kaa adhikaar mil jaataa
 Though it is not clear whether Abhishek has demanded any such royalty, but Mamta's political opponents have definitely given a chance to accuse him of conspiracy

 The state government has also dismissed the case as a 'closed chapter'
 lekin vipaksh didi or unke 'bhipo' (bhatija) ke khilaaf itani jaldi hamalaa band karne vaala nahin he
 While the Left Front has given a PIL in the Kolkata High Court, Mukul Roy has lodged a complaint with the Department of Personnel and Training (dopt) in Delhi demanding action against two administrative officers on the issue of logo

 manase ne kaha tha ki kisi film kii relies se 58 din pehle final copy sensor ke paas bheji jaati he
 In such a situation, how the film made on the Prime Minister was given special concession
 bataa den ki piem narendra modi kii ghoshnaa janvari main hui thi or ye film 39 din main banakar taiyaar ho gai
 MNS also sought resignation from the censor chief
 bataa den 'piem narendra modi' byopic kaa congress samet kai dal lagaataar virodh kar rahe hai
 The parties say that the release of this film before the Lok Sabha elections is a violation of the model code of conduct
 isse voters bhaajapa kii ore aakarshith honge
 The petition to stop the release of the movie was filed in the Supreme Court due to the controversy over the content
 mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne relies par roak lagane vaali yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The film has got a green signal from both the Supreme Court and the Censor Board
 varanasi police ne ek aisi ghatana kaa khulaasa kiya he jisamen logon ke jaruri kagajaat, patr or suchanaaen jo daakghar se nikal kar unke gharon tak pahunchni chaiye thi wo kabadi kii dukaan par pahunch jaati thim
 Nobody but the postman used to do this work
 police ne ek shaks ko range haathon giraftaar kiya he
 Two sacks of necessary documents have been recovered from him, along with 300 papers, including the necessary documents sent from DM, SSP and the court
 ye kagajaat agar police ke haath nahin lagate to wo log shaayad intjaar kii karte rah jate jinke paas inhen pahunchnaa tha
 Because this was garbage in the eyes of the employees of the postal department and they used to sell it to the flea in the greed of earning money
 varanasi ke espi city dinesh singh is babat bataate hai, 'guuruuvaar shaam ko kaint thane se ek aisa mulgim pakadaa gaya he jiske paas se post offis kii bahut mahatvapurn daaken mili hai jise wo kabadi ke paas bechney ke liye pahunch gaya
 On receiving the information, the force reached the cant station and arrested the man from the spot
 giraftaar karne ke baad jab dekha gaya tab donon boriyon main court ke tamaam order hai jo general dak se aate hai wo pade hue hai, rakhiyaan padi hui hai, bank ke kagajaat pade hai
 Important papers of people are lying
 ye logon ke saath bahut hi bada dhokhaa he

 Apart from his locality, he has also found postal of other localities in Benares
 dak bechney kii shikaayat pehle bhi kii gai thi lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 On Thursday, when it came out with the post, some people followed it and they reached directly to the Kabadi
 tab police ko soochna di gai
 When the police reached there and overturned the bag, his senses flew away, because there were all kinds of people except the registered post in it, who were given benches here at Kabadi for just one thousand rupees
 baharhaal dak vibhaag kii itani badi laaparvaahee saamne aane ke baad ab adhikari camere se bachate najar aa rahe hai par jis tarah se is daakiye kii kaali karatuut saamne aayi he wo behad sharmnaak he
 If the police did not get these documents, then those people might have kept waiting for whom they had to reach
 kyonki dak vibhaag ke karmchaariyon kii nigaah main ye kooda tha or wo paisa kamaane ke laalach main ise kabadi ke yahaan bech diya karte the
 Dinesh Singh, SP City of Varanasi, explains, "on Thursday evening, a criminal has been arrested from the Cantt station, from whom very important post offices have been found which he reached to sell to Kabadi
 soochna milane par kaint thane kii force pahunchi or maukey se is shaks ko giraftaar kiya
 After the arrest, when seen, both the sacks have all the orders of the court which come from the General Post, they are lying, the ash is lying, the bank papers are lying
 logon ke mahatvapurn kagajaat pade hai
 This is a huge fraud with the people
 'tippaniyan According to the police, the accused was a postman since 2003 and had been doing post selling games for many years
 uske paas apane ilaake ke alaava banaras ke duusare muhallon ke bhi dak baraamad hue hai
 The complaint of selling post was made earlier but no action was taken
 guuruuvaar ko jab ye dak lekar niklaa to kuch logon ne iskaa peechha kiya or wo sidhe kabadi ke yahaan pahunch gayi
 The police was then informed
 police ne jab vahaan pahunch kar thile ko palata to uske hosh ud gayi kyonki usamen registerd dak ko chhod baaki sabhi tarah ke the jo kabadi ke yahaan mahaj ek hajaar rupee par bench die gaye the
 However, after such a big negligence of the postal department, now the officers are seen escaping from the camera, but the way the black man's black handiwork has come to the fore is very shameful

 dhoni ne england ke khilaaf shanivaar ko barish ke kaaran radd kar die gaye match ke press conference main kaha, is faisle ko lekar kuch baaten saaf thi
 There was no mark in the hot spot
 dekhne par bhi nahin lag rahaa tha ki gend balle se lagi he or ampire ne bhi note out diya tha
 In such cases the batsman gets the benefit of doubt
 unhone kaha, main ab bhi samaj nahin paa rahaa hum ki unhen kaise out diya gaya
 Was the help of snikometer taken for this? Is snico use allowed? Have the help of an audio technician? Or the third umpire gave him out
 is tarah ke kai sawaal puche ja sakate hai
 Why was the batsman not given the benefit of doubt
 iske alaava dhoni bhartiya team main chotil khilaadiyon kii badhati sankhya se bhi chintit hai
 Sachin Tendulkar and Rohit Sharma are the new names in this list
 unhone kaha, shuru main maine kaha tha ki jo kuch hua uskaa ham kuch nahin kar sakate, lekin uske baad lagaataar chotil khilaadiyon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 If Tendulkar has a burning sensation in his right foot, Rohit was injured during the Indian innings
 unke daayen paanv kii anguli main fracture ho gaya he
 Dhoni confirmed that the team has asked to send a new player in place of Rohit
 daayen haath kaa yah ballebaaj puri shrunkhlaa main nahin khel paaegaa
 He said, Rohit will go to the specialist doctor and it is decided that he will not play further in this series
 tendulkar bhi visheshgy ke paas jaaenge
 His injury is chronic, which has emerged
 unhone pichhali shaam ko hamaare saath abhyaas kiya, lekin subah vah feet nahin the
 Dhoni said, a lot has happened in this series
 ab yahi (match radd hona) bachaa tha
 It would have been difficult for him to score 130 runs in 12 overs
 yah mushkil lakshya tha, kyonki hamane pehle saat over main acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 The Indian captain praised his top-order batsmen for scoring 274 for seven in 50 overs
 unhone kaha, salaami ballebaajon ne acchhee ballebaaji kii
 It was important to take the shine off the new ball
 saal ke is samay main shuru main vah swing leti he
 We wanted good partnerships
 rahane ke out hone ke baad parthiv ne sunishchit kiya ki vah kuch bhagidaariyaan nibhaayenge, jisase nichle kram ke ballebaaj teji se ran bana saken

 China has got a chance due to the rift in the relations between America and Pakistan and is in the process of capitalizing on it
 america dwaara 1
 Pakistan has been stung by $ 15 billion worth of security aid and a halt to the supply of military equipment
 usko ab kuch samaj main nahin aa rahaa he or vah america kii is karrwai kaa aarope bharat par madh rahaa he
 On Thursday, Pakistan Foreign Minister Khwaja Asifne had said that US President Donald Trump is speaking the language of India
 vahiin, trump kii latad ke baad pakistan ke paksh main bayaan jari kar china ne hamadardi dikhaai thi
 Behind his sympathy lies his own great selfishness

 He is here to establish his military base

 Jiwani island is close to Chabahar port
 Jiwani island is bordering Iran
 isse ahm baat yah he ki yah bharat dwaara viksit chabahaar bandargah se behad kareeb he
 In such a situation, this move of China can also increase India's concern
 agar china jivani dweep main apana sainya thikaana banane main kaamyaab hota he, to pakistan main yah uskaa doosraa sainya thikaana hoga
 In response to India's Chabahar port, China wants to build a military base in Jiwani Island
 china ke or kareeb aayega pakistanchin ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne daawa kiya he ki america ne bharat ke saath sambandh majboot karne ke iraade se pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai kii he
 This will further strengthen military and trade relations between Pakistan and China
 chini akhbaar ne kaha ki pakistan or china ke bich pehle se hi achche rishte hai, lekin trump prashasan dwaara madad rokane se donon deshon ke bich sambandh or pragadh honge
 This will also increase military proximity between the two countries
 PAK ko china wo nahin de saktaa, jo ham dete hai: usvahim, china or pakistan ke kareeb aane kii atakalon ke bich america videsh vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ''meraa maananaa he ki ve (pakistan) donon deshon ke saath majboot sambandh bananaa chaahate hai, lekin yah jaruri nahin ki jo america se milegaa, vahiin unhen china se milegaa
 Pakistan is also well aware of this
 ''unhone kaha, ''hamaare paas yah kshamta nahin he ki ham bainkon or companiyon ko pakistan main 55 arab dollar nivesh karne ke nirdesh den, lekin saath hi china ke paas bhi yah kshamta nahin he ki vah duniya ko sarvocch gunvattta ke sainya upkaran muhaiyaa karaae

 An American newspaper has already disclosed China's plan to build a military base on the island of Jivani
" haal hi melmericankhbaar washington times ne daawa kiya tha ki guadar bandargah ke paas china apana sainya thikaana bananaa chahta he or iske liye pakistan se baatcheet bhi kar rahaa he
 However, the report was later rejected by China
 aatankwaad ko lekar america raashtrapati ne lagaai thi latadnavvarsh par america raashtrapati donald trump ne aatankwaad ko lekar pakistan ko jamkar latad lagaai thi
 He tweeted, "in the past 15 years, the US foolishly gave Pakistan more than $ 33 billion in financial aid, but Pakistan gave nothing except lies and deception in response
 vah hamaare netaaon ko murkh samajhataa he
 He sheltered those terrorists against whom we are campaigning in Afghanistan
 ab aisa nahin hoga
 '' The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools
 They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help
 No more! - Donald j Trump (@realdonaldtrump)january 1, 2018trump kii is latad ke baad america ne pakistan ko suraksha sahaayta ke taur par 1
 Also prohibited the supply of more than $ 15 billion in funds and military equipment
 america kaa kahana he ki taliban or hakkaani network jaise aatanki sanghathanon par karrwai karne main pakistan vifal rahaa
 He also failed to destroy the hideout of the terrorists from his land

 sharir ke kisi bhi duusare ang kii charbi ko kam kar paanaa utana mushkil nahin hota, jitna beli fat ko kam karnaa
 If your stomach is also growing continuously, then you need to pay attention that if you have some habits, your stomach is increasing
 1
 The habit of drinking diet soda or soft drinks can be dangerous
 If you also mistakenly think that drinking diet soda is beneficial for health, then tell you that it can be your biggest mistake
 agar aap charbi nahin badhanaa chaahate hai to aaj se hi soft drink pine kii aadat chhod den
 Such beverages have high amounts of sugar and calories, which helps to increase fat
 2
 Working continuously is also dangerous
 People who work in the chair most of the time also complain of belly fat
 desk job karne vaale zyaadaatar log mote ho jate hai
 Such people not only complain of enlarged stomach, but also their thighs and waist become unformed
 khaastaur par mahilaayein isse zyada prabhavit hoti hai
 3
 khaane ke dauraan kisi baat kaa dhyaan hi nahin rakhansiogar aap apane aahaar ko lekar laaparvaah hai to aapaki yah aadat bhi aapako motaa bana sakati he
 There are many people who like something if they like something, they just eat without thinking anything
 aisa karne vaale zyaadaatar logon ko bade hue pet kii shikaayat ho jaati he
 4
 tii ve ke saamne baithkar khaanaa bhi he ek behad khatarnaak beemaarizyadaatar gharon main log tii ve ke saamne baithkar khaanaa khate hai
 It has been said in many researches that eating in front of TV is like a disease
 tivi ke saamne baithkar khaane se insaan ko pataa hi nahin chal paata he ki vah kitna kha chukaa he
 In this case, the possibility of getting fat increases
 5
 Eating Junk Food Junk food has become quite common during today's times
 kai baar to aisa bhi hota he ki log saamaanya khaanaa khaane ke badale junk food khaanaa hi behatar samajhate hai or pasand karte hai
 Junk food contains a lot of calories which works to increase obesity

 It is being talked about Leena Maria, the heroine of South and her boyfriend Balaji
 dilli main maaria kii giraftaar ke baad in donon ke bare main ab chennai se jo khabaren aa rahi hai, vah chaunkane vaali hai
 Living in a five-star was Bunty's passion, then walking in carts worth crores of bubbly
 yahi shauk donon ko kareeb le ai, kyonki shauq badi chiz he
 And both big things were done by bad things
 ek chhalaava he, to duusari mayajaal
 One is a cheater, and the other a phobe

 Both of them prepared such a dangerous cocktail of mind and beauty that people went on putting crores in their bag of their own free will

 Don't know if you are his next target in your city? According to the police, many cases of forgery and cheating have been registered against Balaji in Bangalore
 wo sarkari adhikari banakar kai logon ko apane jaal main uljhaakar unhen lut chukaa he
 In fact, Balaji used to hunt people in a very cool way
 wo unase iees yaa bada sarkari afasar ban kar miltaa tha or phir kisi sarkari plan kaa sapana dikhaakar use ek bank acount number detaa tha
 When his victim used to transfer money to that bank account, he used to take money out of the account and get ruffled from there
 balaji yun hi kai saal tak logon ko apni thagi kaa shikaar banaata rahaa
 But in 2011, when the Bangalore police arrested him in a case of forgery, then gradually the raw-sheet of many of his exploits was automatically exposed to the police
 jail se baahar aane ke baad bhi balaji nahin sudhara
 But due to his police record he changed his hideout and went to Chennai

 According to the Chennai police, more than a hundred cases of fraud have been registered against Balaji and Maria in different parts of Chennai

 According to the police, the purpose of taking the farmhouse in Delhi was to carry out some big fraud cases in Delhi

 India's first secretary at the United Nations, Vidisha Maitra, said that Imran Khan has misused the UN platform

 Patel said that Jadeja was part of an interstate gang trying to deceive people by playing religious beliefs
 vah logon ke 12 karod rupee lekar bhaagane kaa aaropee he
 He started his activities last January and promised the people of his fodder (adivasi out of notified) community that he would increase the amount by three times if they would give him the money
 lagata he ki rahul gandhi kaa 'mishan upi' utana aasaan nahin he, jitna congress ke log samajhate hai
 After much effort, Rahul Gandhi got permission to hold a press conference at the Tourist Building
 isse pehle pradesh sarkaar ne is par roak laga di thi
 Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to hold a press conference in Lucknow on Tuesday
 ye conference subah saadhe nau baje honi thi
 For this, permission was also obtained from the local administration
 tourism deveopment board ko uske paryaton bhawan ke liye iske liye paise bhi de die gaye the, lekin maukey par rahul se kah diya gaya ki aapkaa kaarykram cancil kiya jaataa he
 You withdraw your money
 congress kaa aarope he ki aisa raajnneetik kaarnon se kiya gaya he or party kisi bhi keemat par paise waapas nahin legi
 By the way, the young face of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, is ready to revive the party in Uttar Pradesh
 yuvaaon ko party se jodne kaa mishan lekar rahul gandhi ne somvaar se apane 2 dinon ke upi daure kii shuruyaat kii he
 During this time, Rahul Gandhi will go to many districts and turn people towards Congress
 rahul gandhi 2 dinon main soobe ke 9 jilon kaa daura karenge
 During this time, Rahul will not only take stock of the election of Youth Congress organization going on in Uttar Pradesh, but will also try his best to connect people with Congress
 is daure main rahul gandhi naa sirf youth congress ke kaaryakartaaon or ummidavaaron se milenge, balki mayawati ke puraane sansadeey kshetra bhi jaaenge
 There, Rahul Gandhi will also garland the statue of Baba Saheb and also have a meeting with Dalits
 yani upi main baaki siyaasi dalon ke liye khatre kii ghanti baj gai he
 Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has received a setback from the Delhi High Court
 aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle me idi kii exiaar ko radd karne kii virbhadra kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya gaya he
 The FIR was registered by the ED only on the cbi's FIR registered in September 2015
 pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ne isse pehlemoni londringke maamle main virbhadra, unki patni pratibha singh or putr vikramaditya ko poochtacha ke liye talab kiya tha
 The ED had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) registered against the Chief Minister and others on September 2015, taking cognizance after the CBI filed a criminal complaint
 aay se adhik sampati maamlemen singh or unki patni ke khilaaf darj exiaar ko radd karne ke ucch nyaayalay ke inkaar ke chand ghanton ke baad hi sibiai ne 31 march ko unke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil kiya tha
 The High Court rejected Singh's claim that the FIR was lodged due to political vendetta
 jaanch agency singh or unke parijanon par 2009 se 2011 ke bich aay ke agyaat strot se adhik dhan ikattha karne ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Singh was the Union Steel Minister during this period
 jaanch agency ne aarope lagaaya he ki kendriya mantri ke pad par rahete hue singh ne apane or apane parijanon ke naam par elisi kii policiyon ke madhyam se baari maatra main nivesh kiya tha
 Is it always wrong to take a turn in politics and governance? The general belief is that it is wrong to do so
 satta main ek varsh puraa karne ja rahi narendra modi sarkaar par congress aarope laga rahi he ki kai nitiyon ke maamle main vah you-turn sarkaar sabit hui he, kyonki usne upie kii unheen nitiyon ko apana liya he jinka usne kabhi virodh kiya tha
 The question is, why are we being so happy when it is called a U-turn government? The truth is that the four cases in which Modi has turned a major turn as a Prime Minister from the pre-election side of his party is practical and our Is of broad interest
 isaki shuruyaat parmaanu qaraar se hoti he
 LK Advani, who was the bjp's president, had backed Prakash Karat's party to demolish the UPA government, which he called anti-national, in 2008 on the nuclear deal
 aaj modi is qaraar ko bharat-america sambandhon kaa 'centrebindu' qaraar de rahe hai
 The BJP was so strongly opposed to this agreement that when i asked Advani (the book of his memoirs) why he was opposing the nuclear deal, while Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself laid the foundation, he asked the cameras But i was told, "I know that you support it more strongly than the UPA
 " modi ne ise bina kisi sankoch yaa khed ke palat diya he
 The BJP overturned the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) with Bangladesh
 manmohan singh ne jab shaikh hasina ke saath is samjhaute ko antim rup diya tha tab bijepi iske aade aa gai thi
 Today, Modi has passed it without any amendment
 teesri palati pichley hafte dikhaai di
 On the lines of the nuclear deal in UPA-1, the entire opposition led by the BJP opposed the approval of 51% FDI in multi-brand retail trade
 bijepi ke lihaaj se yah virodh swaabhaavik dikhataa tha kyonki bharat main paramparaagat khudara vyapaar (kiraanaa) par kabiz baniyaa samudaay ko bijepi apana vafaadaar vot bank maanati rahi he or epadi ko uske liye khatre ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 The RSS anyway stays against any foreigner or such big thing and this decision was very big in which there was also 51 percent foreign share
 wallmart ko shaitani 'dankal ankal' kaa naam do dashak pehle hue aarthik sudhaaron kii tarj par diya gaya jab vishwa vyapaar sanghathan kaa pehla masauda dankal ke naam se yahaan aayaa tha
 Uma Bharti said that if Walmart came too close to India, it would be doom
 aarthik sudhaaron se judaa yah pehla mudda tha jiske liye congress ne apni siyaasi kismat daanv par laga di thi or ramlila maidan main epadi ke samarthan main pradhanmantri, sonia va rahul gandhi ne ek raily kii thi
 Like the nuclear deal, there was a split in the Lok Sabha on this issue (although it did not have the constitutional obligation of parliamentary approval like the nuclear deal)
 upie kii jeet hui, lekin bijepi ne dhamkee di ki agar vah satta main ai to ise waapas le legi
 His opposition is also recorded in the party's manifesto
 pichley hafte jab modi sarkaar ne epadi par samgr niti kaa elaan kiya to upie kaa faisla pusht hua or bahubrands khudara vyapaar main epadi ko soochibaddh kar diya gaya
 The fourth U-turn is noticeable this week when Modi is going to have a third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping within a year
 bijepi dwaara kii gai upie kii aalochana main ek kendriya vishay yah tha ki sarkaar china or pakistan donon kaa tushtikaran kar rahi thi or sarkaar main aane ke baad endie donon ke khilaaf kadaa rukh apnayega
 In the case of Pakistan, this promise has been fulfilled
 haalanki mere khyal se yah ravaiya avivekpurna va asthaayee he jise aakhirkaar badalane kii jarurat padegi
 However, Modi's turn on China is more dramatic than the other three issues
 shi jab bharat aae the us vakt china ne bharat ko dhamkaane ke lahaze main vaastavik niyantran rekha (elesi) ke paar apni sainya tukdishaan bhej di thim
 In spite of all the criticism on prime time channels, Modi remained silent on this
 china ke masale par saamanytah najuk mizaaj bhartiya suraksha pratishthan ko ve nivesh, vija or yahaan tak ki china-pakistan saudon par pratikriya ke masale par bhi thame hue hai
 It is also worth noting that India's response to Pakistan's military help from China has been very restrained, whereas the promise made by the US for new weapons has been ignored in such a way that it does not make any sense
 
 china ke masale par haalanki kuch or sanket hai jo 1962 ke baad is par bane aresas ke nazariye main buniyadi badlaav kii pushti karte hai
 We saw that they trimmed the Rafale deal to one-quarter the original size
 ab ham dekh rahe hai ki upie ne purvi akraman kor ko jo 90,000 sainikon kii majbootee dene kaa faisla kiya tha, use modi sarkaar chhaantkar ek-tihaai par laane kaa faisla kar chuki he
 Once again Modi is in China and he has also mentioned about the border agreement
 mere khyal se pehle teen faisle darasal rashtriya nitiyon main vyapak nirantarata ko banaae rakhane kaa prayaas hai, khaskar jahaan sansad ne unhen manjuuri de di thi
 The fourth reversal is the most important
 china ke prati dussahasik or jokhim bhare ravaie main ham dekhte hai ki modi rashtriya suraksha kaa ek alag hi siddhant garh rahe hai jisamen china ke prati puraane sanyvaadee nazariye ko durust kiya gaya he jahaan masale ko khatre ke rup main kam jabaki avasar ke rup main zyada aanka ja rahaa he
 Or maybe there is a deadlock expected on this issue
 main to yahaan tak kahana chaahunga ki modi ne pakistan or 1962 kii sainya sharmidagi par apane pratishthan kii vishvadrushti ko vibhajanmukt kiya he
 They know that war cannot be fought again, the world of 2015 is completely different and the RSS call for war in the sixties will no longer work, that "today we have defied the Himalayan peak, move away People of the world, India is ours
 " modi aaj apane ateet ke akramanakari ko jab gale laga rahe hai to unhone apane vichaarkon kii is chetavanee ko thukraa diya he, jo kah rahe hai ki kahin ve bhi china se nehru kii tarah bhai-bhai vaale jumale main na funs jaaen
 While all these dramatic steps have been taken very easily, the issue of GST and Land Acquisition Bill is still stuck
 sawaal uthta he ki kuch chizon par you-turn kaise kaam kar gaya jabaki duusare masalon par palati kaam nahin ai? aaie, pi
 V
 narsingh raav se kuch sabak len
 Of all the leaders i had the opportunity to know as a political correspondent, the most cherished dialogue i ever had with anyone was Rao
 unhone record kiye gaye sava ghante ke ek samvaad main ek baar jis siddhant kaa khulaasa kiya tha, use main jokhimarahit you-turn kaa pivienar siddhant kahana pasand karuunga
 i asked him how despite being a lifelong socialist, how did he convince himself to take a U-turn on the issue of economy in the historic summer of 1991? He said that in a complex country like India, you cannot afford to see someone taking a U-turn
 sawaal uthta he ki narsingh raav ne aakhir bina dikhaae ki ve you-turn le rahe hai, kaise you-turn liya? main unhen ek achche chaatr kii tarah sun rahaa tha
 The elderly man said, "brother, suppose that the ground under your feet is roaming," and as he said this he spread a rare smile on this knowledge
 pradhanmantri ke bataur apane pehle varsh main modi ne aakhir hamaare ginaae tamaam you-turn ke paimaane par raav ke siddhant ko kaise bartaa he? parmaanu qaraar, khudara vyapaar main epadi or bangladesh seemaa samjhaute par yah bahaanaa bananaa kahin zyada aasaan tha ki pair ke neeche kii jameen pehle hi khisak chuki he
 The first two were passed by votes in the Lok Sabha, so if his party had voted against him, would it not have been to change a policy passed by parliamentary approval to play with parliamentary dignity? All these issues can be taken as the decisions of a seasoned politician
 elbs par unki party kaa virodh ateet main bhi utana damdaar nahin rahaa he or vaise bhi use rokane main mamata banerjee agua rahi hai
 Therefore the BJP has a shield
 jiesti or bhoomi adhigrahan par sameekaran alag tha
 One was partially obstructed by the BJP while the other fully supported it
 donon ne apane tareeke se chunautiyaan pesh kii hai
 The BJP had never in principle opposed the GST, but strategically opposed it by putting Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Raghavji in front of him, who went on the rampage after allegations of sexual exploitation by his servant
 modi ne agar parmaanu qaraar or khaskar elbs ke maamle main barti vinamrata or apni purvavarti sarkaar ko die shrey kii tarj par jiesti ke masale par bhi vyavhaar kiya hota to ve use paarit karvaa le jate
 He and his party instead made the mistake of calling it their initiative
 chaahe jo ho, agle satr main vah paas ho jayega or ek sanyukt pravar samiti ise un tamaam vikrutiyonse mukt karne main madad hi karegi jo upie ne isamen daal rakhi hai
 The issue of land acquisition is very different because the BJP is not changing its side against the UPA but by doing so it is supporting the UPA
 isane 2013 main is ajeebogareeb nae kanoon ke paksh main bade utsaah se vot kiya tha jo mere khyal se bahut gadamd tareeke se anjaam diya gaya jisamen saamaajik prabhaav akalan kii pranali behad jatil he
 It has guaranteed sit-down employment to ngos across the country
 bijepi ke netaaon ne iske samarthan main vot dete vakt koi sawaal nahin uthaaya tha balki ve to is kanoon ko or kathor bananaa chaahate the
 Today that same law is spoiling his health and they are trying to make fundamental changes in it
 yah he asli you-turn
 Here you cannot pretend that the ground under your feet is slipping
 aisa aapaki dhithaayee or tajurbe kii kami ke kaaran hua he kyonki aap siyasat se bharpoor ek kanoon ko adhyadesh ke raste lekar aae
 Modi has shown both practicality and courage in his first year
 gomance, gobar, ghar vaapasi or carch par chaahe jo kuch gata ho, unhone badi kamyaabi se sarkaar ko aresas / bijepi ke thas vaicharik khol se khinch kar baahar nikaal liya he
 Now it is more Modi government which is cast in their own mold and i consider it right now
 unamem ek kami sansadeey kaushal kii he ki ve vinamrata kaa istemaal ranneetik tareeke se nahin kar pate
 Running a government in a democracy is like playing Test match cricket
