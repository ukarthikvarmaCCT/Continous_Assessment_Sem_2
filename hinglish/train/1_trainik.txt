lekin mangalvaar ko ferewel party main jate-jate bhi yediurppa ne dhamak kaayam rakhane kii puri koshish kii
 Read: Yeddyurappa lost his temper after his resignation, he told the top government officials that he would become the Chief Minister again within 6 months
 unhen puraa yakeen he ki in 6 maheenon main wo sankat se ubar jaaenge or ye hi vajah he ki wo mukhyamantri kii kursi sadanand gauda ko saunpkar janaa chaahate hai
 This statement not only expresses the intention of Yeddyurappa but also the secret that is hidden in this why the decision of the new Chief Minister of Karnataka is not being done soon
 padhein: yediurppa ne lokayukta report ko hoicourt main di chunautiyediurppa kii manshaa tabhi puri hogi jab karnataka kaa nayaa mukhyamantri unki pakad kaa hoga
 And in this context, Yeddyurappa's Khasamkhas Sadanand Gowda becomes the strongest contender for the cm's chair in Karnataka
 lekin panchayat raaj mantri jagadish shettar kii bhi vidhayakon par pakad kam nahin or isliye wo bhi siem pad ke majboot daavedaar hai
 But how to decide one of the two strong contenders
 faisla mushkil he or isliye rajnath singh or arun jetali phir se pahunche hai bangalore
 In the picture that emerges so far, both Jagdish Shettar and Sadanand Gowda are equal contenders for the post of Chief Minister and the selection of either of them can increase rather than end the discord of Karnataka
 isliye ho saktaa he ki ant tak ek mukhyamantri or ek upmukhyamantri jaisaa koi formula saamne aa jaae
 Significantly, the Lokayukta of Karnataka has accused Yeddyurappa of indulging in illegal mining, following which he had to resign under pressure from the party

 ''view this post on Instagram # notmyindia
 It has been two weeks since the unprecedented communication blockade of Jammu and Kashmir
 My heart is heavy as the sky is dark over India’s democracy right now
 My heart has always ached for the terrible human rights violations in the Valley - right from the times of the Congress government in the 90's
 The disappearances and killing of innocent youth is not new
 Nor is the opening of fire on demonstrations
 But this government has crossed every line with it’s draconian measures
 i want to ask every Indian - every Bengali, Maharashtrian, Gujarati, Tamilian et al - how would you feel if your state was split overnight and converted into a Union Territory? Leave Article 370 aside for a moment and answer that honestly
 For me the shock and anger at this unconstitutional act is laced with sorrow at how our own people must be feeling in this part of our country
 Feelings we can only imagine - as there is still a blackout! On a personal level i have never known anyone before in the State
 But now i have a child there
 Zaira Wasim - the heart and soul of the Sky is Pink
 i have known her and her family over one year - spent marvelous times with them in both Srinagar and Jammu
 i was with them in Jammu just a day before this happened
 Zaira was very worried that something terrible was afoot because of the sudden influx of massive troops
 i reassured her not dreaming something so draconian and unprecedented could be carried out
 And since then I’m besides myself with worry at not being able to reach her
 To give her strength at this difficult time
 To wish them Eid Mubarak
 I'm sure they couldn't celebrate it
 We parted with the promise to stay in touch every day
 Echoing a promise she and her brother make to each other in the film in a brilliantly acted and moving scene
 But i can’t reach my baby right now

 Any comment about Hindi films? i think there is a lot of indiscipline in Bollywood
 yahaan ek film ko banane ke liye kam se kam 2 se 3 saal laga dete hai or meri bahut choti life he
 i agree that Hindi cinema is very big, but the life of actors is very short
 mere paas itnaa time nahin he, lekin ab vaqt badal rahaa he or ummid he ki yahaan bhi ab anushaasan dhire-dhire hi sahi, lekin zarur aayega
 At the moment, i feel very lacking in discipline
 isamen sudhaar laane kii zarurat hai
 Kamal Haasan's allegation of showing Jayalalithaa a 'dictator' in Bigg Boss, filing a complaint or choosing from politics? i don't think i will be able to do a Bollywood film now, because now i am a party president and now i have to do a lot of big things
 main ye nahin kahuunga ki ye kaam filmon se zyaada dharmik yaa pavitra hai, lekin ab 63 saal kii umr main mujhe samaaj or hamaari socity ko vaapasi uphaar ke taur par wo sab waapas karnaa he, jo mujhe mila he
 Marudur Gopalan Ramachandran had done 15 -20 films when he was an MLA, but when his responsibility started growing and when he became the party president, everything had changed
 or shaayad aisa mere saath bhi ho
 i will do the same, because now you have a lot of responsibility
 ham tab antertenment ke dhandhe ke bare main nahin baat karte, jab ham tamilnadu ke vikaas or bijnes kii baat karte hai
 Kamal Haasan for the first time waved the party flag, also announced the office bearers that your film like Kaala gives Vishwaroopam message? i have always been different from others and thus comparing one actor to another actor or one director to another director i do not like to do
 har kisi kaa kaam karne kaa apana tarika hota he, jis tarah cricket ke sabhi khilaadi ek-duusare se alag hote hai, thik usee tarah actor bhi ek duusare se alag hote hai, bhale unka rigelt ek jaisaa ho
 'I do not try to make my point, commenting on politics in my films like others, but openly and firmly put my point of view in front of people
 ek kalakaar or desh kaa naagarik hone ke naate meraa point of vyuu majboot hota he, jo logon ko sochane par majaboor karata he
 Look at any of my films, such as Tevar Magan, Hey Ram, Dasavatharam, etc
, there is a message of politics by region, in the film Dasavatara, i told my thinking about politics in a very light way
 baad main mere vichaar samay or filmon ke saath bold or majboot hote gaye
 This idea has come to the fore in o Rama and Vishwaroopam

 asal main sholay ko banane ke liye ramesh sippi ne apane pita ji pi sippi se teen karod rupee liye the, jiske chalate puri starcast kii selary 20 lakh rupee main nipta di gai thi
 Sholay was also made only because before that Sippy's film Sita and Geeta became a hit
 sita or gita ko maatr 40 lakh rupee main banaaya gaya tha or wo hit hui thi

 chardhaam kii yatra par uttarakhand gaye madhya pradesh ke rajgad jile ke bujurg puuran singh un chand saubhagyashaalee logon main se hai, jo jivit ghar waapas laut aae hai
 But Puran Singh has moist eyes
 vah us khaufnak manjar ko bhuulaa nahin paa rahe hai, jab unke bachapan ke dost dariyaav singh unase hameshaa ke liye juda ho gaye
 Puran Singh still did not leave his friend's side
 unhone dariyaav singh ke shav ke saath pahaado par saat din gujaarey
 There are many more people like Puran Singh who have lost their loved ones in this disaster of Uttarakhand
 rajgad ke saarangpur ke puuran or dariyaav (65 varsh) bachapan se dost the or donon ne ekasaath kedarnath ke darshan karne kii yojana banaai thi
 At the time, this havoc of nature rained on the area, both were in the Gaurikund region
 tej hawaaon ke saath barish hui
 The mountains started collapsing
 puuran bataate hai ki unhone kisi tarah pahaad par sharan lee
 He survived somehow, but his childhood friend left because of cold, hunger and thirst
 ve visham halaat main pahaad par apane dost dariyaav singh ke shav ke saath pade rahe
 After that with the help of the army, he and Daryava's body were brought to Haridwar
 puuran singh ko is baat kaa afsos he ki vah punya kamaane kedarnath gaye the, magar ghar laute dost kaa shav lekar
 This is not the story of Puran alone, but there are many families in Madhya Pradesh who have lost their loved ones
 jabalpur ke je
 P
 jat or unki patni kii ankhon se aansu tham nahin rahe hai
 Both have lost their daughter Joe
 ve bataate hai ki beti, damaad or naati ke saath ve uttarakhand gaye the

 The state government has arranged for a Boeing aircraft to return people stranded in the disaster

 The sudden demand for cash and lack of cash in atms in many parts of the country forced the Reserve Bank to come back on foot
 sarkaar or rigerv bank ne halaat sudhaarney ke liye prayaas tej kar die hai, lekin kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa ki sthiti kab saamaanya hogi
 Among all these, there are two reasons for the cash crisis which are not going unnoticed
 cash kii tangi ke liye tarah-tarah kii vajahen bataai ja rahi hai
 The reasons given by the government and the Reserve Bank so far include the closure of big notes, increased demand for notes before Karnataka elections, festivals in many parts of the country, heavy withdrawal of cash due to crop season etc
 
 lekin gaur karne kii baat to yah he ki tyohaar to har saal aate hai or chunaav bhi ek hi rajya main he
 Earlier elections have been held in Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Gujarat, Himachal
 lekin pehle aise halaat to kabhi nahin dekhe gaye
 There are two reasons that have to be considered
 1
 Not enough growth in bank deposits, if you look at a recent report of the Reserve Bank among all, the total deposits in the country's banks by March 30, 2018, 114
 75 lakh karod rupee tha, jabaki ek saal pehle yah 107
 58 lakh crores
 is tarah isamen badhat to hui he lekin ek vitt varsh main mahaj 6
 7 percent
 yah pichley 54 varsh main bainkon ke jamaa main hui sabase kam badhat he
 According to the experts, due to heavy deposits during the note ban, the base is high and the interest rate of banks has come down

 bihar main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan karaari haar kaa saamana kar chuke vipakshi dal aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main endie ko haraane kii ranneeti par manthan kar rahe hai
 In this series, Rashtriya Janata Dal veteran and former Union Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh once again suggested the merger of all opposition parties
 raghuvansh prasad ne shuukravaar ko dobaaraa kaha ki rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa muqabla karne ke liye sabhi kshetreey vipakshi partiyon kaa mahagathbandhan main vilay karnaa chahie
 However, this idea does not seem to be supported in his own party
 ullekhneey he ki bihar main paanch dalon ne mahagathbandhan banaakar loksabhaa chunaav saath ladaa tha lekin unhen keval ek seat par hi jeet mili
 Reacting to Raghuvansh Prasad's suggestion, spokesperson of Hindustani Awam Morcha (WE), the smaller constituent of the grand alliance, Danish Rizwan said it was a good idea
 agar argedy or anya ghatak ‘ham' main vilay karte hai to ham uskaa swaagat karenge
 It is worth mentioning that the founder president and former Chief Minister of 'hum' Jitan Ram Manjhi is warning that if his demands are not kept in the Grand Alliance, he will split up and contest the assembly elections alone
 duusari ore argedy netaa tejasvi or tej is samay apni hi party or parivaar ke sankaton se jujh rahe hai
 Tejashwi, who had shown hyperactivity on Twitter before the Lok Sabha elections, now seems completely passive

 Let me tell you that in the month of June it was reported that Tejashwi has been out of Patna for almost a month
 vah is bich apane ghar par iftaar ho yaa mujaffarpur main bacchon kii maut sabase khud ko dur rakhaa
 If RJD sources are to be believed, the party's national president Lalu Yadav called and advised them to go back to Patna
 in sabake bich sabase zyaada tanaav main party ke vidhayak nazar aa rahe hai
 He says that the party is as frustrated and disappointed as Tejashwi's stance after the results of the Lok Sabha elections did not happen even after losing the 2010 assembly elections
 pichley bihar vidhansabha chunaav main kisko kitne vot or ab kiskaa palada baari? In Ballia, Uttar Pradesh, a case of death of a child has come to light due to the negligence of doctors

 The pharmacist handed over this work to the rickshawman present there
 yah rickshevaala aspataal parisar main hi rahata he or shavon ko le jane kaa kaam karata he

 In the role of his poetic compilation 'zid' published from Rajkamal, he wrote that language like fire, wheel and boat is also a unique invention of man! Even more unique in the sense that it is related to his body and soul! Our behavior towards language really reflects our behavior towards democracy and the whole of humanity! We are at a time when arrogance and aggression are reaching their peak in the language of the dominant powers! "the language of the market has crushed the language of our mutual behavior! The language of advertising has taken the language from poetry to slut language
 And has reached the limits of obscenity! The restlessness of our whole poem expressing the contradictions and irony of this time and finding new tools of resistance Uky worry! Many times despair and sadness are involved in it, but the greatest power that an ordinary person possesses and which even the greatest dominating power and the biggest failure cannot be snatched away from him, is his insistence! " This word will appear many times! It is perhaps this stubbornness that in this time of market, the poet is constantly in favor of the constant battle of man being displaced from his land between mist and confusion
 Every area of giving power! Break the weak light even conceit of dense darkness! That hope these poems here! "literature Read Rajesh Joshi birthday till their representatives compilation 'insistence had chosen the' best compositions 1

 It could also be changed to darkness by dragging the feet or pressing a small button as per the need
 a light sometimes came from far away
 The friend also used to doubt the lights, said, seeing him by tearing the fiber, where the light is black, more light was also dazzling and darkness only creates darkness
 It was wrong to think, but there were many faces of darkness, there was a large part of the country which was immersed in darkness for many days due to the sudden deterioration of a grid of power house, but it was even bigger than that which was born out of political stubbornness of power or in the mind of a slave who was kneeling before any world power

 tab kya pataa tha ki aage chalakar rishton kaa ye sameekaran aise badalegaa, ki ek saath khadey hona mushkil ho jayega
 
 
 ? Never openly talked about the relationship by the year 1981, it became difficult, not impossible

 The answer was clearly visible in the interview of the printed line at that time
 magar amitabh us rishte ko lekar khamosh hi the
 That sequence of interactions in front of the era proved to be the last for Amitabh and Rekha

 ) sarvocch nyaayalay ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki bihar kii team bihar cricket association (bisie) ke tahat ranjai trophy or anya gharelu toornament main hissaa legi
 a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud said that the decision has been taken keeping in mind the interests of cricket
 adaalat kaa yah aadesh tab aayaa, jab pratipakshi cricket association of bihar (siabi) ke aditya verma ne adaalat se kaha ki 15 november 2000 ko jharkhand ke gathan ke baad or rajya ke vibhaajan ke baad se bihar ko ranjai trophy, dalip trophy or kisi anya gharelu toornament main khilne kaa avasar nahin mila he
 On behalf of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), senior advocate Shekhar Naphade told the court that due to being headquartered in Jamshedpur, the membership of the BCA was granted to the Jharkhand Cricket Association, which was accepted by the BCCI
 unhone adaalat ko bataaya ki bihar cricket association ko associat sadsy ke rup main manyata mili he or 2018 main gharelu toornamenton main hissaa lene ke liye taiyaar bhi he
 To this, Chief Justice Mishra said, "we will record your statement
 ' naapahare ne kaha ki bisie ke tahat toornamenton main hissaa lene ke liye bihar ko kai anya aupchaariktaaon ko puraa karnaa hoga
 ' chitfund ghotaale is desh main nae nahin hai
 It is not new that the owners of chit fund companies are seen closer to political parties than to any other industry
 yahi nahin, ye chitfund companiyaan media main bhi haath aazmaati rahi hai
 In the last two-three decades, many chit fund companies have started and closed and with them the hard earned earnings of many poor and middle class people have been plundered
 companiyon ke maalikon ko isse zyaada fark padaa ho, isaki khabar nahin he
 All these companies started newspapers and TV channels, keeping close with the leaders so that their presence in every private or social function kept making headlines
 is ateet ko dekhte hue yah maanane kii koi vajah nahin he ki sharada ghotaale kaa vaasta netaaon se nahin rahaa he
 Those accused of Saradha chit fund scam should also be caught and the poor should get their money back
 lekin kya CBI kii karrwai bhrashtachar yaa ghapalon se ladane kii kisi sarkari chintaa kaa nateeja he, yaa vah ek vipakshi netaa kaa baaju marodane kii koshish he
 
 
 The If the BJP government really cared about the Saradha scam, it would not have included Mukul Roy, who is one of the main accused in the scam, at least
 un par jab FIR ho chuki thi, tab unhen party main shaamil kiya gaya or ravishankar prasad or kailash vijayawargeey jaise varisht netaaon kii maujuudagi main shaamil kiya gaya
 Not only this, he was also met with Amit Shah
 kya party ko yah poochna nahin chahie tha ki sharada ghotaale main lipt hone ke aarope se ghirne ke baavjood mukul roy uske saaf-suthere ghar main ghusane kii koshish kaise kar rahe hai
 
 
 That is not to say that if BJP is saving Mukul Roy, then action should not be taken against other corrupt leaders
 lekin jab aap bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kii andekhi kar or kai maamalon ke aropiyon kaa bachaav kar kisi ek maamle main atirikt samvedansheel ho rahe hote hai, to bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ko hi kamazor karte hai, use ek rajnatik rang dete hai
 Mamta Banerjee, who is sitting on a dharna in Kolkata, understands this properly, so she has stood firmly against the legal patch that she and her leaders should have feared
 unhen maaloom he ki yah ladaai bhrashtachar ke viruddh nahin he, unki raajnneeti ke viruddh he
 If there is any case against her own people or close people, then under the cover of this political fight, she will be able to hide it
 yah anayas nahin he ki mamata ko desh bhar ke gaiyr-bjp raajnneetik dalon kaa samarthan milane main zaraa bhi der or mushkil nahin hui
 So we are finding that what was needed to be fought like a real fight against corruption has turned the activism of the Central Government into a political battle
 jo log yah tark de rahe hai ki ek eemaandaar sarkaar ke kilaaf saare beyimaan ikattha ho gaye hai, yaa to unhone tathyon se ankhen moond rakhi hai yaa jaan-boojhkar apana paksh chun liya he
 Because the finance minister of the government, which came out to take action on the Saradha scam, has been seen to stand openly in favor of the accused of another scandal this week
 aap yaad kar sakate hai ki pichley dinon khabar ai ki CBI ne ICICI bank kii CEO chanda kochar or videokon ke maalik venugopal dhoot ke kilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 They are accused of licking crores of rupees from the bank with mutual connivance
 yah ilzaam kai saal se lagata rahaa or kai saal bank ise nakaarta rahaa
 But the facts kept coming up, then the bank conducted an internal investigation
 is jaanch ke aadhaar par bank ne chanda kochar par karrwai kii, pehle unase istifa liya or baad main unki pension tak roak lee
 There is also talk of recovery from them
 lekin is maamle main CBI kii ore se FIR darj karne vaale afasar kaa 24 ghante ke bheetar tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 Because Arun Jaitley, the country's finance minister and one of the most powerful leaders of BJP, who is undergoing treatment across the seven seas, publicly wrote a blog, calling the CBI investigation as meaningless and defending Chanda Kochhar and the rest
 unhone sidhe-sidhe kaha ki yah jaanch kahin pahunchane vaali nahin he, kyonki iskaa maqasad kuch logon ko fansaana he
 Those who can openly defend a CEO prosecuted by their own institution in the case of corruption, they are sensitive in any other matter, then it is not only the fight against corruption, but also the institutions created for this fight to be unbelievable
 It seems
 yah anayas nahin he ki in varshon main CBI sabase zyaada vivaadon main ghiri hui he
 There the clash at the top level has reached the courts
 kehane kii zarurat nahin ki yah CBI ke raajnneetik istemaal kii ati kaa nateeja he
 Now come to the second question
 BJP ko achaanak is raajnneetik karrwai kii kyon suujhi
 
 
 The It would be a demonstration of extra naivety to assume that a CBI team went to interrogate the Kolkata Police Commissioner without any political sanction
 to kya BJP ko andaaza nahin tha ki yah qadam apni naatakeey raajnneeti ke liye mashhoor mamata banerjee ko naatak kaa ek or avasar degaa
 
 
 The Mamta fights her political battles with absolutely no teeth and she did this in this matter too
 unhone itnaa zyaada shor kiya ki puure desh ke netaa jute aae
 Now it has become another power show before 2019
 nihsandeh BJP kii apni ranneeti rahi hogi
 He doesn't have a big stake in Bengal - he has two seats, so he has nothing to lose
 lekin mamata ke kilaaf sharada scam kaa morcha kholkar usne bengal congress ko bhi asamanjas main daal diya he or CPM ko bhi waar karne ko uksaaya he
 Obviously, any way Mamata is weak, the alliance will be weak
 lekin yah raajnneeti palat kar waar bhi kar sakati he
 No one knows better than to play the victim
 unhen bengal kii kahin zyaada badi sahanubhuti mil sakati he
 From this perspective, in recent times, many steps of the central or BJP governments are seen to be staggering
 2013-14 ke bich jis tarah kii galtiyaan UPA sarkaar kar rahi thi, usee tarah kii galtiyaan ab modi sarkaar bhi kar rahi he
 In Delhi, filing a chargesheet against Kanhaiya Kumar and Khalid Omar without the approval of the state government was such a step
 is qadam par police ko adaalat kii fatkaar sunani padi
 Similarly, the arrest of Professor Anand Teltumbde, despite the Supreme Court's protection in Pune, led to the Maharashtra Police being reprimanded by the High Court
 hadabadaae hue ye kadam bataa rahe hai ki party or sarkaar ke bheetar ghabrahat he
 The latest CBI action in West Bengal is also the result of this nervous currency

 das saal tak is 'chamak' ko soni pikchars network india ne dikhaaya lekin ab bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ko nae qaraar kaa intazaar he
 Sony had the first right to make an offer to the board, but the BCCI decided to send an open tender
 varsh 2008 main world sports group ne ipel ke adhikaar takreeban 6500 karod ru
 , Which joined Sony for official broadcasting
 ab board ko ummid he nae qaraar se das saalon ke liye wo isse tiguni takreeban 18,000 karod rupee kii rakam hasil kar sakati he
 The comments duniya is nivida ko lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ke anuroop dekh rahi he, lekin board kaa kahana he usne sudhaaron kii bayaar pehle se hi baha rakhi he, ravivaar ko dilli main board adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne kaha, " hamaare kaam kahaan court ko chunauti de rahe hai, mujhe nahin lagata aisa ho rahaa he
 We started many reforms before the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 board ko qaraar se tiguni rakam milane kii ummid he, lekin yahi paisa kanoonee fans bhi ban saktaa he
 Sony had the right of first refusal, but the board bypassed the tender, bypassing it
 sutron ke mutabik digital adhikaar bhi dabloosgy ke paas hai aise main bisisiai, lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ko maanane ke baavjood nae kanoonee pachade main funs saktaa he
 The BCCI is selling 10 years of rights for the Indian subcontinent this time, but for digital and other countries, the duration of the rights will be 5 years
 board salanaa aam baithak se pehle lodha cameti ke saamne front foot par kheltaa dikh rahaa he, lekin prasaaran par ye pintara kanoonee maidan main use waapas baikfoot par dhakel saktaa he
 In the year 2008, World Sports Group acquired IPL rights worth about 6500 crores
 main hasil kiye the, jisane adhikarik prasaaran ke liye soni se haath milaayaa
 Now the board is hopeful that for ten years from the new agreement, it can get three times the amount of Rs 18,000 crore from it
 tippaniyan The world is looking at this tender in line with the recommendations of the Lodha Committee, but the board says it has already shed the winds of reforms, on Sunday, in Delhi, Board President Anurag Thakur said, "where are our works challenging the court?" Yes, i do not think this is happening
 hamane kai sudhaar lodha cameti kii siforeeshon se pehle shuru kar die the
 The board expects to get triple the amount from the agreement, but the same money can also become a legal trap
 soni ko pehle inkaar kaa adhikaar tha, lekin nivida mangakar board ne ise darkinar kar diya
 According to sources, the digital rights are also with the WSG, in which the BCCI may get caught in the new legal tussle despite accepting the recommendations of the Lodha Committee
 bisisiai is baar bhartiya upmahadweep ke liye 10 saalon ke adhikaar bech rahaa he, lekin digital or baaki deshon ke liye adhikaar kii avadhi 5 saal hogi
 The board is seen playing on the front foot in front of the Lodha Committee before the annual general meeting, but on broadcast this maneuver could push it back onto the backfoot in the legal arena
 duniya is nivida ko lodha cameti kii siforeeshon ke anuroop dekh rahi he, lekin board kaa kahana he usne sudhaaron kii bayaar pehle se hi baha rakhi he, ravivaar ko dilli main board adhyaksh anuraag thakur ne kaha, " hamaare kaam kahaan court ko chunauti de rahe hai, mujhe nahin lagata aisa ho rahaa he

 It was a film to introduce new standards for us, our generation
 25 varshiya navdith abhinayta ne bataaya, aise samay main jab abhinayta ek hi samay main kai filmein karte the, unhone (aamir) alag tarah se kaam karne kaa nirnay liya or ek samay main ek hi cheez par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Aamir's film selection and his commitment and Ranbir's (kapoor) spontaneous performance inspire me

 bihar main abhi tak apana ghoshnaptr jari nahin karne par rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ne nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 RJD says that this has exposed the dual character of JDU
 rajd ke pradesh pravaktaa chitaranjan gagan ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav kaa teen charan samaapt ho chukaa he or chauthe charan ke liye matdaan hona he
 But the JDU not yet releasing the election manifesto reveals its dual character
 rajd netaa ne kaha he ki jediu kii ore se ghoshnaa patr jari nahin karne kaa spasht sandesh he ki vah bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ke aadhaar par hi vot maang rahi he
 He said that whatever controversial issues are there in the BJP manifesto, the JDU leadership has not yet agreed on any electoral platform
 matlab saaf he ki bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ko jadyu netritv kii maun sweekruti praapt he
 Regarding this, the situation inside JDU has also become quite explosive
 chitaranjan gagan ne kaha ki nitish kumaar kaa bijepi ke saamne puri tarah se samarpan se jediu ke kuch varisht netaa apane ko asahaj mahasoos kar rahe hai
 This is clearly visible
 bataa den ki bihar main somvaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ke chauthe charan kaa matdaan he, lekin ab tak jadyu ne apana ghoshnaptr jari nahin kiya he
 If the party high command is to be believed, the final decision to issue the manifesto can be taken on Monday
 sutron ke mutabik anuchhed 370, anuchhed 35A, samaan naagarik samhita or ram mandir ke mudde ko lekar bijepi or jediu ke bich main matbhed he
 While the BJP in its manifesto has spoken of abolishing Article 370 and 35A from Kashmir, enforcing the Uniform Civil Code and constructing a Ram temple in Ayodhya within the purview of the Constitution, the jdu's stand on all these issues is absolutely Is different
 jediu kaa maananaa he ki anuchhed 370, 35A or samaan naagarik samhita lagu karne ke mudde par sabhi paksh se baatcheet honi chahie uske baad hi koi faisla lenaa chahie
 The jdu's stand on the Ram temple issue is that the Supreme Court's decision on this whole issue should be respected
 bijepi ne 8 april ko hi apana ghoshnaptr jari kiya tha, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki satta main dobaaraa lautne par jammu kashmir se anuchhed 370 or 35A ko khatm kiya jayega or samaan naagarik samhita ko lagu kiya jayega
 jdu's manifesto was to be released only on April 14, but it is believed that due to pressure from BJP, the party has delayed its release
 jaankaree ke mutabik jediu ne somvaar ko patna main jediu samiti kii baithak bulaai he, jahaan ghoshnaa patr jari karne ko lekar antim faisla liya jayega

 In a recent survey, it was found that 57 percent of the people looking for jobs give wrong information in their resumes
 aisa karne se ummidavaaron kaa impressant intervyuu dene se pehle hi kharaab ho jaataa he
 To avoid this, while making a résumé, a lot of attention needs to be given to the things that are written in it
 ummidavaar apane objective or quality bataane main sabase zyada galtiyaan karte hai
 Here we will tell you about some things which are seen in almost every resume and this makes the recruiters most irritated or bored
 1
 i can end any crisis
 Most recruiters do not like to see this in their resumes
 jab tak aapke paas apni baton ko sabit karne ke liye valid panits na ho, bhul kar bhi aisa na likhen
 By claiming to end any crisis in the resume, you create problems for yourself
 2
 i am a good communicator and a good writer
 Your skill can be easily estimated with the help of your resume
 communicesh skilaur riting skill ke bare main rigeume main jarur bataanaa chahie lekin badhachadh ke kii gai baaten yaa 'khud miyaan mitthu hona' aapke kariyar ke liye acha nahin hoga
 3
 main team main kaam karne main maahir huunaap shaayad nahin jaanate honge ki recruiter ke paas jitne rigeume aate hai, unamem se zyaadaatar main yahi baaten likhi hui hoti hai
 Good thing if you really have this skill
 intervyuulete samay panel yah jaan legaa ki aap vaaki team ke saath kaam karne ke liye feet hai yaa nahin
 With such information you will bore the recruiter
 4
 i am very diligent in writing that there is no need to write that you are very hardworking
 agar aap kaabil hai to aapke blog, ricep,technical skilsor aapaki padhai-likhaai is baat kii gavaahi khud de denge
 If you really want to get a job then avoid writing this about yourself
 5
 i do a good job under pressure, the recruiter will not start telling you that we were just looking for boys / girls like you
 iske ulat wo aapkaa rigeume dekhakar apana sar khujane lagenge
 In this case, one should always write thoughtfully
 apane kaam se pyaar karne vaala koi bhi shaks dawaab main acha output de hi nahin saktaa he
 Will work under pressure only if he is doodle
 apana impressant kharaab na karen

 They will be told the achievements of the Modi government
 saath hi unhen bijepi main shaamil hone ke liye prerit karenge
 During this campaign, BJP expatriates will put a sticker outside the house of the people

 According to Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, in the first three days, the BJP expansors have received tremendous support from the common people

 He claimed that in a place like Batla House, people are competing that he will stick a sticker outside his house with the slogan "mera Ghar BJP Ghar"

 Priyanka Chopra's cousin Manara (barbie is the real name) has made her Bollywood debut with bold insistence
 unhone apane iraade film se pehle hi jaahir kar die the ki unhen bold seen dene main koi parhez nahin, or film main is baat ko ve bakhubi charitaarth karti najar bhi aati hai
 He and his director have used the body to meet their Indian standards
 jis vajah se film kii kahani gaun or drishyon ke jariye film ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii jaati he
 It seems that the stubbornness of the director and producer is due to the "stubbornness" of showing Manara
 kahani main kitna damayah kahani krime reporter rohan or haseen ladki maaya (manaaraa) kii he
 Maya stares at him
 rohan kii apni ek alag kahani he

 jisamen ek ladki maari jaati he
 Then there is the case of hit and run
 bas iske baad kai rahasyamay ghatnaon kaa daur shuru ho jaataa he
 During this time, there are murders, sex scenes come, the passion of wanting someone is seen and on this all the director plays his full bet
 kahani bahut hi swaabhaavik he
 Many fantastic stories of Ishq's passion are already in Bollywood
 diarector kuch hatakar nahin kar sake hai

 puri film ko sex apil kii vajah se hi bechaa gaya he

 ve parade par sexi or hot to lagati hi hai
 Yes, it would be wrong to talk about acting because the director's attention has not gone much towards it
 film ke baaki sitaarein ausat hi hai
 It is useless to talk about him because the film is entirely dedicated to Manara and his talent: kissing, boldness, wetness in the rain, drunkenness and more
 kamai kii baatis hafte ungali or jed plus ke saath hi sex apil vaali jid relies hui he
 Both the other films where some social messages are taken
 vahiin jid puri tarah se vyaskon ke manoranjan vaali he
 The story of the film is nothing special but sex appeal is its capital because before this, sex appeal had helped in running Surveen Chawla's Hate Story-2
 film single screen theatres or is tarah kii filmein dekhne ke youth main acha kar sakati he
 Then it can find audiences in Tier-2 and 3 cities as well
 ise lekar verde of mouth bhi kaaphi kaam karegaa
