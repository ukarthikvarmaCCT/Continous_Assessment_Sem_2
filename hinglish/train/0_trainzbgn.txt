 comsakrawkara ek aisi shashakt vidya he jiske madhyam se rachanaakaar apane-aap ko sidhe-sidhe abhivyakti karata he
 Through interviews, we not only get to know about the ideas related to the country, society and politics of a creator but also get a complete picture of his literary thoughts
 ek tarah se saakshaatkaar kii marfat lekhak pathakon or aalochakon ke samaksh apni rachana kii vakaalat bhi karata he
 In the process, he not only responds to the allegations leveled against his works, but also makes many new interpretations related to his works which are often untested
 is lihaaj se rachana or rachanaakaar donon ko samajhane ke liye saakshaatkaar sarvaadhik vishwasaneey or pramanik vidha he
 These books of interviews of Mridula Garg and Mamta Kalia published under 'mere Interview' series are also very important in terms of understanding their writing and personality
 mridula garg or mamata kaaliya samaan peedi kii rachanaakaar hai
 His urban middle-class background is also one
 donon ke adhyayan-adhyaapan kaa vishay hindi nahin rahaa he
 Mridula Garg has been associated with economics, while Mamta Kalia has English literature
 par, donon ne apni rachanaatmak abhivyakti ke liye hindi ko chunaa or hindi ke sahitya sansar ko apni kai shashakt rachanaaon se samrudh kiya he
 The best thing is that for both, composition and action is not a matter of hobby, but for them it is linked to the inevitability of existence
 donon ne lagbhag yah sweekaar kiya he ki agar ve lekhika nahin hotin to hinsak yaa aatmghaatee hotin
 This interdependent relationship between the creations and the existence of oneself was gradually eroding in Hindi literature and has almost ended today
 isi kaaran, aaj rachanakaaron kii bharmaar he lekin utkrisht rachanaaen anupasthit hai
 Among her various works, Mamta Kalia is most satisfied with 'homeless' and Mridula Garg with 'chitkobra'
 yah gaur karne laayak baat he ki prabhaavshaalee stri rachanaakaar hote hue bhi donon sahitya-srijan ke kshetra main stri-purush vibhaajan kii jabardast virdohi hai
 Giving a logical reason for this protest, Mridula Garg says, "this gives a lot of women unnecessary publicity and encouragement
" jo vastut: lekhak nahin hotin or unhen lekhan ke kshetra main tike rahane kii sweekruti praapt ho jaati he
 Secondly, the partiality of looking at the woman apart does not evaluate the writing or work of those women, who are very unjust and do not want any exemption
 ” mamata kaaliya ke bhi lagbhag aise hi vichaar hai
 Actually, this is the generation of women creators who have more faith in their creations than on any discussion or reservation
 inaki rachanaaen kahin se bhi purush rachanakaaron kii tulana main kamatar nahin hai
 The need for a crutches of discussion is only those whose creations are infrequent
 mamata kaaliya deshaj sandarbhon ke anukool stri pahndharata kii vakaalat karti hai
 They are not very satisfied with Western modernism and feminism
 sahitya main tathakthith bold lekhan ke naam par lekhikaon dwaara 'stri youniktaa’ ke chithran ko ve swasthkar nahin maanatin
 In her 1984 interview with reference to the writings of Amrita Pritam, Krishna Sobti and herself Mridula Garg, she says, "in her portrayal, the woman is like a thirsty woman wandering in search of men
" in lekhikaon ne nari ke jaruri astitv ke sawaalon ko praaia: nahin chuaa he
 For this type of writing, i consider Krishna Sobti a criminal
 iske vipareet main apane ko ushaa priyavanda, mrinal pandeya, mannu bhandari, mehrunnisa parvej ke zyada najadik paati hum
 ”clearly, there is substantial dissent even among authors avoiding‘ feminine discourse ’
 darasal, kisi bhi stri rachanaakaar kii asal chunauti ek vaikalpik katha-drushti ko saamne laane kii hoti he
 In its absence, an independent image cannot be created by destroying the male-made image of a woman
 mamata kaaliya kaa puraa jor stri kii swatantra chhavi nirmit karne par he na ki anyon kii tarah stri pakshadharata ke naam par use number do kaa purush bana dene par

 lekin hamane unka naam waapas lene kaa faisla kiya he
 On the other hand NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal said that the opposition had fielded a candidate for the Speaker's post but in view of the demand of some legislators and in view of the dignity of the Speaker's post, he has withdrawn his candidate

 It is clear from the kind of developments that came after the Maharashtra assembly election results that it is a state that has been defying every criterion set by the Center for it and will continue to challenge every institution to protect the interests of its people
 
 is puure sandarbh or gaurav gaatha ko samajhane ke liye hamen yaad rakhana hoga ki kis tarah se chhatrapati shivaji ke drudh nishchay kii badaulat dilli ke shaskaon kaa prabhutv kamjor pad gaya tha
 The rise of the BJP under the leadership of Modi and Shah after 2014 has been unprecedented
 2019 ke chunaavon main party ne apni pakad or majboot banaai he
 Weak opposition was the reason behind the rise of BJP at the Center
 saath hi party ke khud ke sahyogiyon ne bhi isaki keemat chukaai, lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke thik baad hue vidhansabha chunaavon se yah saaf ho gaya ki janata ko kisi bhi ek dal kaa prabhutv sweekaar nahin he
 The BJP was claiming a clean sweep in Haryana and Maharashtra, but the results were reversed
 maharashtra kii baat karen to yahaan bijepi kii raah main chunauti khud lambey samay tak uski sahyogi rahi shivasena bani
 Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress will form government in Maharashtra tomorrow
 bijepi or shivasena kareeb teen dashak tak saath rahe
 Both parties remained together in every ups and downs
 satta main rahe hon yaa nahin
 Even in those days, when the party under the leadership of LK Advani was trying to establish its place in the state and the Shiv Sena was supported by Bala Saheb Thackeray and also when both the parties in the form of Amit Shah and Uddhav Thackeray got new leadership
 haalanki donon dalon ke netritv parivartan ke baad sthitiyaan bhi badalin or 2014 main shivasena ne alag raah pakadi
 However, she returned to the NDA after the election
 haalanki, rajya main satta kaa bantwaaraa baraabar nahin tha, jo gathbandhan main daraar kii vajah bana
 But the Shiv Sena, while accepting the mandate received in the form of an alliance, placed the interests of the people of Maharashtra paramount and accepted it as such
 siem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit hone ke baad uddhav thakare ne apane pita bala sahabthakare ko yaad kiya
 a regional party whose vote share increased in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, which wanted to move beyond the coalition while strengthening its regional aspirations, was unsuccessful at every step
 aise main shivasena ke liye yahi sahi samay tha apni jagah banane or ise or majboot karne kaa
 It seemed that the purpose of this alliance was to end a regional party for the BJP and to establish dominance in the state
 haalanki tamaam asahmatiyon ke baavjood, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke uddhav thakare ko is vaade ke saath ki sheersh pad samet satta kaa bantwaaraa baraabar hoga, donon dalon ke bich chunaav purv gathbandhan hua
 At the request of the state unit of the BJP, the Shiv Sena also agreed to give up its claim on some seats
 haalanki iske baavjood chunaav nattejey na to bijepi kii apekshaaon ke anuroop rahe or na hi shivasena ke
 After this Devendra Fadnavis spoke to the Shiv Sena and declared himself the Chief Minister, ignoring all the promises, which proved to be the 'last nail in the coffin'
 isse yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki bijepi shivasena ke saath satta kaa bantwaaraa to chaahati thi, lekin gathbandh dharm or jimmedaari nibhaane ko taiyaar nahin thi
 With this, it became clear that this time Shiv Sena is not in a mood to dishonor any kind
 bijepi or shivasena kaa gathbandhan kareeb teen dashakon tak chalaa
 This was followed by events that no script writer could even imagine
 bijepi, jisane pehle rajyapal ko soochna di thi ki vah na to sarkaar banaaegi or na hi kisi gathbandhan main shaamil hogi, ne achaanak you-turn le liya or satta tak pahunchane ke liye sharad pavaar kii party ensipi main daraar daalane kii koshish kii
 It was so early to reach power that the Governor and President's office made a rubber stamp
 haalanki unhen is baat kii jaraa bhi ummid nahin thi ki shivasena, ensipi or congress se is had tak takkar milegi
 The three parties strategized wholeheartedly to deal with this government made by keeping constitutional rules and regulations
 ek taraf ensipi apane saare vidhayakon ko ekajute karne main lagi thi, to duusari taraf shivasena vidhayakon ko surakshit rakhane ke liye intjamaat main juty thi
 On the other hand, the Congress fought this battle in the Supreme Court with full force
 shivasena, ensipi or congress ke vidhayakon ne shakti pradarshan kiya
 Gaining power by following all the constitutional processes led by the BJP has become the norm and such gambling has come to be called 'masterstroke'
 khaskar mritpraaya media ko is tarah kii kisi bhi harakat ko 'chanakya niti' kehane se pehle sanyam baratane kii jarurat he
 The people of the country have seen in Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Meghalaya and Karnataka how the BJP rose to power despite not having the required numbers
 maharashtra is tarah ke kisi bhi kadam ke aage jhukne vaala nahin tha or supreme court ne yah sunishchit kiya ki samvidhan sarvopari bana rahe
 Uddhav Thackeray and his wife Rashmi along with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari
 
 
 maharashtra kii is ladaai ne bharat kii shakti kii gatishiltaa main ek aitihaasik or ahm badlaav dekha he
 Even though Shiv Sena and Congress have come together to run a coalition government for the first time, this cooperation between the two has been recorded in history
 sharad pavaar kii party ensipi or shivasena jaisi do ahm kshetreey partiyaan saath ai hai, taaki maharashtra ko aisa shashan mil sake, jiskaa wo hakdaar he
 Those people who are saying that this alliance will last longer, are once again running a 'masterstroke' of mistakes
 is gathbandhan ko majboot bane rahanaa hoga, taaki loktantr ke siddhanton ko or majboot kiya ja sake or satta santulan bana rahe
 On the other hand, the BJP, which has slipped from 71 per cent in December 2017 to 40 per cent in the power of various states, surely needs to rethink its strategies and political maneuvers that have led to its Getting separated from all promises and allies
 hamaare shahar kii shaan bollywood ke shabdon main un sabhi logon ke liye ek salaah he jinhen shivasena ke bare main likhane kii jaldi rahati he

 Aaj Tak and India Today news director Rahul Kanwal asked the Home Minister that when looking at CAA (citizenship Amendment Act) and NRC (national Citizen Register), the question arises as to what is the intention? In response to this question Amit Shah Said, 'don't try to connect it with the constituency

 The partition of this country should never have been done on the basis of religion
 lekin sach yahi he ki desh kaa vibhaajan dharm ke aadhaar par hua

 Narendra Modi brought the citizenship law, now he too will be able to live with respect
 apni bacchiyon kii raksha kar paaenge, apane dharmik vishwaas ke saath ji paaenge
 That is why PM brought this law
 jaisaa ki hamane vaada bhi kiya tha
 ' pradhanmantri narendra modi somvaar ko himachal pradesh ke solan pahunche
 Here he said that these names are openly saying that their mission is to spoil Modi's image, but Modi's mission is to raise the image of India to the highest in the whole world
 modi ne kaha ki namdaar kehete hai ki modi ko haraana inkaa mishan he, lekin modi kaa mishan bharat ko jitaana he
 Today, Congress has become the vote cutter party in the country
 ye modi nahin kah rahaa he khud kangras ke log kehete hai
 The only reason for this is their arrogance
 congress ko lagata he ki namdaar parivaar jo bhi kahe vahi sahi he
 PM Modi said that these Congress leaders ask for votes in the name of their ancestors, but when questions are asked on their exploits, they say- Happened! It happened that this thinking weakened India's defense policy and military policy so much
 narendra modi ne kaha ki shimla udaan yojana ke tahat judane vaala desh kaa pehla sthaan bana he

 modi ne kaha 'duniya ke bade-bade desh bhi digitigeshan ko lekar abhi sangharsh kar rahe hai', lekin bharat main mobile, aadhaar or jandhan khate kii shakti garib se garib ko takat de rahi he
 Rupay card and BHIM app are being used in every village of Himachal Pradesh, but today China is not only self-sufficient in defense material, but also a big exporter in the world
 iske ulat, bharat aaj duniya main raksha saamagree aayaat karne vaala sabase bada desh he
 India kept importing so much, the Congress kept saying - what happened
 piem ne kaha ki ye mahamilavati hamaare sainikon kii, hamaari fouj kii maan-maryaada or shaury kaa sammaan nahin karte
 They call our army chief as Gundi ka Gunda, IAF chief as liar
 jab koi kahata he ki ye galat hua, to ye jawaab dete hai- hua to hua
 He said, 'this is a tainted history of insulting the army, failing to protect the country, due to which the Congress does not talk about surgical strikes, air strikes
 aap mujhe bataaie- aatankiyon par karrwai karke hamane sahi kiya? pehle kii sarkaar kii tulana main, pichley paanch saalon ke dauraan raksha utpaadan main 80 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 When the Congress was in government, our army kept asking for bullet-proof jackets
 congress 6 saal tak unki is maang ko taalati rahi
 Our children were martyred in terrorist attacks, Naxalite attacks, the Congress kept saying - what happened
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki jameen se lekar aasmaan tak in logon ne itane ghotaale kiye ki aisa koi din nahin tha, jab akhabaaron main inke karnaamon kii khabar na chhapati ho
 Even today Namdar and his relatives are out on bail
 congress kii sthiti aaj desh main vot katua party kii ho gai he
 Modi is not saying this, the people of Congress themselves say
 iskaa ek hi kaaran he, inkaa ahankaar
 They feel that whatever the Namdar family says is right
 unhone kaha ki congress or uske mahamilavati saathiyon ne apane das saal ke raaj main, har bade faisle ko taala or jo faisle liye bhi, wo is tarah liye ki desh ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad gaya
 Atal ji had entrusted India to the Congress to grow at the rate of 8 percent and that too to an economist Prime Minister
 agar congress ne apane 10 saal ke shashan main ise banaae rakhaa hota, tab aaj 10 saal main desh kahaan se kahaan pahunch jaataa
 PM Modi had reached Himachal to campaign for BJP candidate Suresh Kashyap from Solan

 During the debate on the no confidence motion, Congress President Rahul Gandhi today launched a scathing attack on the Modi government
 rahul ne rafel se lekar mob linching tak ke jariye piem modi ko nishane par liya
 These are 30 key points of Rahul Gandhi's speech
 1
 Rahul Gandhi while referring to the 'jumlas' said that the Modi government had promised two crore jobs, but the government only gave jobs to four lakh youth
 ye sarkaar sirf jhuthe vaade karti he or puraa desh jumala strike kaa shikaar he
 2
 jo kaam china 50 hajaar yuvaaon ko 24 ghante main rojgaar detaa he, aap 400 yuvaaon ko 24 ghante main kaam dete hai
 3
 berozegaron ko ye sarkaar kabhi kahati he ki pakora banaao to kabhi kahati he ki dukaan kholo
 Highest unemployment in last 7 years
 aaj karodon yuva berozegaar hai
 4
 piem modi ne chunaav se pehle vaada kiya tha ki har bhartiya ke khate main 15 lakh rupye aaenge, lekin wo paise ab tak nahin aae
 PM tell when 15 lakh will come
 5
 When PM Modi went to France, one Rafale suddenly became Rs 1600 crore
 pehle rafel 540 karod kaa tha
 Under the pressure of PM Modi, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has lied to the country
 rafel deal echeel se kyon lee
 PM Modi should reply
 6
 On the Rafale deal, the Defense Minister said earlier that i will tell the country the price of Rafale
 uske baad dephence ministar ne saaf kaha ki main ye aankada nahin de sakati
 7
 rafel ke saude par kaha gaya ki france-hindustan kii sarkaar ke bich sikresi pact he
 i met the President of France
 maine sawaal poocha pact ke bare main to unhone kaha- aisa koi pact nahin he
 This is the truth
 unhone mujhe bataaya, aap ye baat puure hindustan ko bataaie
 8
 hindustan ke piem ke dabaav main aakar nirmala sitaraman ji ne rafel deal par desh se jhooth bolaa he
 Who is helping, why is it happening, tell the country
 9
 We all know how the PM has relationships with businessmen
 unheen main se ek shaks ko rafel deal di gai
 The deal from HAL was withdrawn and given to that businessman
 us kaarobaari ko 45 hajaar karod kaa phayda pahunchaaya
 10
 piem modi 10-20 kaarobaariyon ke liye sab kuch karte hai
 The world knows pm's relationships with big businessmen
 11
 The PM suddenly took action against black money at eight o'clock and demonetised it
 unhone elaan kar diya ki ab puraane note nahin chalenge
 They probably did not understand that farmers, laborers, poor do business in cash
 12
 PM is not a watchman but a participant
 modi sarkaar main bhrashtachar ke kai maamle hue hai
 pms give money to businessmen putting their hands in pockets
 13
 GST was brought by the Congress party
 tab gujarat ke siem rahete hue aapane virodh kiya tha
 14
 ham chaahate the ek jiesti ho, jisaki dar kam se kam ho
 But you made five different rates
 puure rojgaar ke system ko aapaki sarkaar ne jabardast thokar maari he
 Small shopkeepers also put in income tax
 aapane karodon logon ko barbaad kar diya
 15
 piem kii chote dukandaaron se baat nahin hoti
 pms only talk to suit-booted PM Modi
 16
 a photo of PM comes on Jio's advertisement 
 piem 10-20 bijnesaman ke liye kaam karte hai
 17
 jab piem ke mitra kaa putr 16 hajaar guna apni aamadani badhaata he to piem ke munh se ek shabd nahin nikalataa

 piem modi hans rahe hai, par ve navars hai
 They are not looking at me, they cannot see in my eyes, because PM does not have the truth
 yahi satya he
 The whole country has just seen
 maine piem ke bare main saaf-saaf bolaa he
 PM cannot put his eye in my eye
 19
 PM had a swing with the President of China on the banks of the river
 uske baad usee samay china ke hajaar sainik hindustan kii seemaa ke andar the
 20
 hamaare sainikon ne apni shakti dikhaai, wo china ke saamne khadey hue
 But a few days after that, PM goes to China
 bina agenda ke baat kii
 Did not raise the issue of Doklam
 ye china kaa agenda tha
 The soldiers cheated the PM
 ye sachai he, isko palata nahin ja saktaa he
 21
 kisaan kahata he, piem aapane dhai lakh karod hindustan ke sabase amir kaarobaariyon kaa karja maaf kiya
 With folded hands you say, forgive us a little debt
 vitt mantri kehete hai ki aapkaa karja maaf nahin hoga
 22
 duniya main petrol-dijal ke daam kam ho rahe hai, par desh main bad rahaa he
 23
 emspi main piem ne puure desh main aapako das hajaar karod kaa phayda diya he
 The government of Karnataka gave a profit of 34 thousand crores in one state only
 24
 a few days ago, the Economist magazine wrote on the cover, India is unable to protect its women
 duusare deshon main aisa opanian he
 25
 puure desh main daliton, adivasee, alpsankhyakon par atyaachaar ho rahe hai
 People are being killed, crushed
 kya ye hindustan ke nahin he
 Why does not a word come out of the pm's mouth
 ve apane bhaashan main jawaab den
 On the contrary, his ministers go and defeat him
 26
 Both PM and Amit Shah are different types of politicians
 wo hamaari tarah nahin hai
 We can stay out of power
 lekin piem or shah satta se baahar nahin rah sakate
 27
 abhi kuch der ke liye kaarywahi sthagit hui to main andar gaya to vipaksh ke sadasyon ne mujhe badhai di
 He said very well
 aapke sadasyon ne haath milakar kaha- bahut acha bole
 28
 akali dal kii netaa muskura kar mujhe dekh rahi thim
 This feeling is all over the country
 hamaara kaam is feeling ko jodne kaa he
 29
 puraa kaa puraa vipaksh or aapke bahut saare log milakar piem ko chunaav main haraane ja rahe hai
 30
 aap sochoge mere dil main piem ke khilaaf gussa, krodh, nafrat he
 But i say with heart, i am thankful to PM, BJP RSS that they taught me the meaning of Congress
 hindustani kaa matlab sikhaaya
 Heartfelt thanks for this
 aapane mujhe dharm, shivaji or hindu hone kaa matlab samajhaayaa
 Thank you for this jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane or vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kiye jane ke baad se pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he
 In this regard, Pakistan first bothered India and then called the removal of Article 370 a war crime
 iske baad pakistan ne bharat ke saath vyapaarik rishte khatm karne kaa elaan kar diya or ab usne is maamle ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad or antarrashtriya nyaayalay main le jane kaa elaan kiya he
 However, the pauper Pakistan will have to face the international stage
 pakistan sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 1948 ke jis rijolution ko lekar chilla rahaa he, usne (khud) hi us rijolution ko khatm kar diya he
 Law Professor Dr
 rajesh dube kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne 1965 main bharat par hamalaa karke sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke rijolution ko khatm kar diya tha
 The United Nations Security Council has also spoken of ending this resolution
 saal 1948 ke rijolution kii shart yahi thi ki koi desh ek-duusare par hamalaa nahin karegaa, lekin pakistan ne is shart ko tod diya tha
 So now there is no existence of that resolution
 unhone kaha ki agar pakistan ne kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya manch par uthaane kii koshish bhi kii, to usko munh kii khaani padegi
 Dubey says that now the discussion should be on pok and Aksai China
 pioke or aksai china bhi bharat ke hisse hai
 International affairs expert Dr
 Rajesh Dubey says that even more important thing is that since the end of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir has become an integral part of India and now not only Pakistan but any country in the world interfered in this matter
 Can not give antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat koi desh kisi duusare samprabhu desh ke aantarik maamle main dakhal nahin de saktaa he
 India is a sovereign nation and if a country interferes with the internal matter of India, it would be considered a violation of sovereignty
 lihaaja pakistan ke paas kashmir mudde ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main le jane kaa koi aadhaar hi nahin he
 In response to a question, Dr
 Rajesh Dubey said that Pakistan will not be able to take up this matter even in the International Court of Justice, because the International Court of Justice only hears a case when both countries agree
 dube kaa kahana he ki bharat pehle se hi kashmir mudde par antarrashtriya nyaayalay par sunwaayee ke khilaaf rahaa he
 India has made it clear that Shimla and Lahore agreements have been reached between India and Pakistan
 jinamein donon desh aapasi vivaad ko dwipaksheeya vaarta se sulajhane ke liye sahamat hue hai
 Therefore, without India's consent, the International Court of Justice cannot hear Pakistan's appeal
 lau professor dow rajesh dube kaa kahana he ki antarrashtriya str par dwipaksheeya samjhaute sabase zyada ahm maane jate hai
 This means that if there is a bilateral agreement between any two countries, then the disputes between them will be settled under the bilateral agreement
 dwipaksheeya samjhaute ko darkinar karke antarrashtriya kanvension yaa kisi duusare kanoon ke tahat do deshon ko aapasi vivaad sulajhane ke liye sanyukt raashtra baadhya nahin kar saktaa he

 He throws Arjuna out of the house
 priti ke pita uske or arjuna ke rishte kaa virodh karte hai
 Because they both belong to different castes
 iske baad arjuna priti se 6 ghante kaa samay detaa he or final nirnay lene ke liye kahata he, agar priti 6 ghante ke andar unke paas nahin ai to wo rishta khatm kar degaa
 After this incident, Preeti's parents take a call from the daughter, due to which she is unable to talk to Arjun
 iske baad wo jaise-taise arjuna ke ghar pahunchati he
 But by then Arjun angrily injects morphine
 or wo do dinon tak behosh padaa rahata he
 Meanwhile, Preity's housemates force her to marry a boy of her caste
 jab arjuna ko is shaadi ke bare main pataa chalata he to wo uske ghar jaakar hangaamaa karata he
 Arjun is beaten up and arrested for creating a scene
 arjuna ke pita apane bete ko ghar se baahar nikaal dete hai
 After this, Arjun becomes intoxicated
 wo hameshaa nashe main duba rahata he
 Operates by drinking drugs or alcohol and collapses due to dehydration
 ek maamle main arjuna kaa blad cemple le liya jaataa he or usamen drugs paaya jaataa he
 After which Arjun goes on trial
 isi ke saath film main or bhi kai twist or turn aate hai
 Arjun wanders here and there like crazy
 haalanki baad main wo ghar chalaa aata he
 At the end of the film, Arjun comes to know that Preeti is not married to anyone, she breaks the marriage on one occasion and is about to become the mother of Arjun's child
 jab arjuna ko is baat kii jaankaree hoti he donon phir se saath ho jate hai or khushi-khushi jindagi basar karne lagate hai
 It will be interesting to see how much Kabir Singh's story matches Arjun Reddy's
 kyonki kabir singh ke tiger or nae poster main dikhaae gaye seen arjuna reddy ke hoobahoo hai
 By the way, Shahid Kapoor has said that a lot of changes have been made in the remake
 kuch deshon main 'vistaarwaad' kii pravriti hone sambandhi pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tippanee par china ne aaj saavdhaanee bhari pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki yah spasht nahin he ki vah kis sandarbh main yah baat kah rahe hai or china ne unki pichhali tippaniyon kii yaad dilaai, jinamein unhone bharat or china ko samrik bhagidaar bataaya tha
 When asked about the remarks made during Modi's visit to Japan during a media briefing here, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said, "we have taken cognizance of relevant information about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Japan
" aapane unke dwaara kii gai tippanee kaa ullekh kiya he
 i do not know in what context he is saying this
 ' The spokesperson said, 'but i can answer your question by quoting his (modi's) words
 unhone kaha tha ki china or bharat samaan vikaas ke liye samrik saajhedaar hai
 Good neighborly relations and cooperation between the two countries are very important for the well being of the whole world and humanity
 ' Earlier Modi today criticized the 'expansionist' tendency of some countries, who 'encroach' into the ocean of others
 modi ne kaha, 'duniya do dhaaraon main banty he
 One is the stream of expansionism and the other is evolutionism
 hamen tay karnaa he ki vishwa ko vistaarwaad ke changul main funsane dena he yaa vishwa ko vikaswad ke maarg par le jaakar, nai unchaaiyon par le jaakar nai unchaaiyon ke avasar paidaa karnaa he
 Those who follow the path of Buddha and follow evolutionism develop

 The charge was leveled against Ranvir Sena
 is hatyakand ke baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu prasad ne patna ucch nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish amir das ke netritv main ek ayog banane kii ghoshnaa kii
 The motive was to find out the cause of the massacre

 Meanwhile, Lalu Prasad lost power and Nitish entered Kumarasatta

 ) The Reserve Bank rules say that the account holder can withdraw up to Rs 24,000 in a week just by filling the withdrawal receipt from the account
 ab rigerv bank ne aam aadmi ko raahat dene ke liye nae niyam kaa elaan kiya he
 If an account holder makes a new currency deposit with the bank, there will be no limit for withdrawing money from the bank
 yani aap yadi bank main 50,000 rupee kii nai karency jamaa karte hai to aap 24,000 rupee kii seemaa ko paar kar 50,000 rupee kii nikasi kar sakate hai
 This rule of the Reserve Bank is very clear
 notebandi kii prakriya shuru hone ke baad nai karency kii chapai, nai karency kaa cirkulation, bank se nikasi, bank main jamaa ho rahi rakam, atm kii haalat sabakuch buree tarah buree tarah se prabhavit ho chukaa he
 Let's know, understand the new rules of the Reserve Bank
 somvaar ko rigerv bank ne mana ki desh main bainkon ke paas karency kii gambhir samasya paidaa ho chuki he
 Withdrawals from banks have increased during the last 20 days of demonetisation
 aam aadmi ke saath-saath kaarobaari jagat rigerv bank kii nikasi seemaa par apane khate se lagaataar paise nikaal rahaa he
 2
 is nikasi main sabase zyada istemaal 2000 rupee kii nai karency kaa ho rahaa he
 This currency printing is taking place two months before the introduction of demonetisation
 vahiin 500 rupee kii nai note abhi bhi bazaar main nahin pahunch pai he
 The decision to print it was taken by the government just 1 week before demonetisation
 3
 Before demonetisation, the most used currency in the country was 500 rupees
 nai 500 rupee kii karency main deree ke chalate bainkon se badalawaane kii prakriya main sabase zyada 100 rupee or 2000 rupee kii note kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 It was also natural that the biggest challenge in the circulation of the 2000 rupee note was that of the retailer, so it does not appear to have much use for shopping
 4
 Along with the 100 rupee currency issued from the bank, the old 100 rupee note in the economy became most important for transactions
 in donon kaarnon se 2000 rupee kii note jise mili usne sanchay kar liya
 Actually, 100 rupee note has become most important for shopping and retail
 lihaaja, donon hi karency bainkon main waapas puhanchanaa band ho gai
 5
 kendra sarkaar or rigerv bankko 500 rupee or 2000 rupee kii nai karency ke mudran main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 This thing is being understood by the common man through news
 vahiin desh main ritel sector sarvaadhik cash par chalata he
 Till the time of demonetisation, wholesalers and retailers used to exchange the most cash
 din ke kaarobaar ke baad shaam tak yah paisa bainkon main jamaa ho jaataa tha
 But after the current problems, small notes have stopped reaching the bank here
 bank se nikasi kii seemaa he, lambii qatari he or roj nae niyam aane kaa khatra barkaraar he
 Therefore, people are shying away from depositing small cash in the bank for their convenience

 The Prime Minister said that he should get a chance to put his point in Parliament and reach it to the people

 bhaajapa netaaon kaa yah bayaan us vakt aayaa jab kuch hi ghante pehle pradhanmantri ne sansad main is masale par bayaan diya
 Jaitley said that the government should cancel all the 142 coal block allocations given to private companies and start the auction afresh
 unhone kaha, "aisa kiya jayega tabhi sachai kaa pataa lagegaa or pataa chalegaa ki pradhanmantri ke bayaan main kitni sachai he
 The allocation should be canceled because no one can be allowed to enjoy the money that was looted by the public in a corrupt way
 " Condemning the Prime Minister's statement in Parliament, Jaitley said, "the Congress has the same tendency to insult it if you cannot change the CAG
" " unhone kaha, "pehle to pradhanmantri ne sari jimmedaari apane upar lee or phir dhire-dhire sari jimmedaari kisi or par madh di

 Sushma also misunderstood the reports that there is a difference of opinion among the NDA constituents on the issue of demanding the Prime Minister's resignation
 unhone elaan kiya, "bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main yadi bhaajapa ko akele hi chalanaa pade to ham vah ladaai ladenge
 " marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ne kaha he ki sieji ne jin koyala block aavantnon ko doshapurn paaya he, use radd kar unki nilaamee kii jaae
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury also rejected Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's claim that states such as West Bengal had opposed the auction of the coal block and demanded its allocation
 tippaniyan Yechury told media persons that since 2004 when the Congress came to power, since then all the private companies have been allocated coal blocks, they should be canceled

 Amid the uproar, the Prime Minister gave his statement in both houses
 bayaan ke baavjood hangaamaa jari rahane ke kaaran donon sadanon kii kaarywahi teen baar ke sthagan ke baad din bhar ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 In his statement in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the CAG report, Manmohan Singh defended himself and his government

 The CAG has alleged in its report that the government exchequer 1 due to lack of transparency in the allocation of coal blocks

 com / iovtyjcat2— India Today (@indiatoday)january 20, 2018 Film Name: Omertadirector: Hansal Mehtastar Cast: Rajkumar Rao, Rajesh Tailang, Rupinder Nagra, Kewal Arora Duration: 1 hour 38 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 3
 5 staranational aword vining nirdeshak hanslaa mehta or rajkumaar raav kii jodi ne shahid, city lits, aligarh jaisi behtareen filmein di hai
 Now this pair is going to give a different kind of cinema to the audience once again with Omerta
 film ko kai festivels main pehle hi dikhaaya ja chukaa he jahaan isaki taareef bhi hui hai
 This film had to be made with enough papad for the censor approval
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad kisi tarah ye relies ko taiyaar he
 Let's know how this film is made
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani omaar shahid shaikh (rajkumaar raav) kii he jo paidaa to pakistan main hua, lekin uskaa paalan-poshan or parvarish landan main hui he
 Omar first goes to Pakistan to avenge attacks on Muslims in Bosnia and then commits several incidents by staying in Delhi, India
 film main 1992 se lekar 2002 tak kii avadhi main omaar ke kriyakalapon ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 Which includes many more important incidents including kidnapping of foreigners in Delhi, the Kandahar Aircraft Compromise, the attack on the World Trade Center, as well as the murder of British journalist Daniel Pearl
 film main tamaam sandarbhon ko kis tarah dikhaaya gaya he iske liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 During the shooting of Omerta, the mental state was uncomfortable: Why watch Raoakhir? This film is only 98 minutes, which is the shortest film of Hansal Mehta till date
 lekin rajkumaar raav ne ek baar phir se bahut hi umdaa abhinay kiya he
 He seems completely engrossed in the role of Omar and many scenes have been made where Rajkummar Rao can be seen in a completely different avatar
 ham yah bhi kah sakate hai ki is film ko bananaa aasaan kaam nahin tha
 Only filmmakers like Hansal Mehta can make such films
 film kaa becoground score bahut badhiya he
 There are many scenes that make you think whether Omar was really such a dangerous terrorist
 film kii research work kamaal he
 While watching the film, it does not seem that Hansal Mehta has not even met Omar or his family to make it
 film kii raftaar bahut hi shandaar he
 In the chat show, Rajkummar Rao 'utare clothes' in front of the actress, there is nothing in VIDEO weak episode which looks weak
 haalanki jab yah film festival main dikhaai gai thi to kai seen maujuud the, jinhe sensor kiye jane ke baad ab darshak nahin dekh paaenge
 However the way Hansal Mehta has made the film is quite good
 agar aap edlt hai to film ko miss nahin kar sakate
 The budget of the box office film is said to be around 14 crores
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki film ko kitni badi relies milti he or saath hi iskaa weekend collection bhi nirmaataaon ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hone vaala he
 The Avengers are already making a stir at the box office, it will be interesting to see how many screens this film will get in the presence of Avengers and amitabh-rishi's 102 Not Out

 On the cold war going on with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the NDA alliance of Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party President Upendra Kushwaha, Tejashwi said that Upendra Kushwaha's ideology has no place in BJP or NDA
 mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa ofer dete hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki upendra kushvaha mahagathbandhan main aana chahen or argedy ke saath saath judana chaahe to isko lekar unke saath baatcheet kii ja sakati he
 Taking a dig at the Chief Minister, Tejashwi said that due to Nitish Kumar's coming to the NDA, there was going to be an uproar over the coordination of seats among the alliance partners
 nitish par hamalaa karte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki bhaajapa ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main jadyu ko ek bhi seat ladane ke liye nahin dena chahie
 Tejashwi claimed that this time Nitish Kumar will also lose the election in his home district Nalanda
 argedy netaa ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan main siton ke talmail ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he
 Tejaswi said that Upendra Kushwaha will come to the grand alliance or not, for that he will have to make up his mind first and talk to them
 tejasvi ne kaha ek baat bilkul spasht he ki nitish kumaar bhaajapa se nafrat karte hai or usee tareeke se bhaajapa bhi nitish kumaar se nafrat karti he or agar nitish kumaar agar endie main bane rahenge to mahagathbandhan ko kaaphi phayda hoga
 Tejashwi said Nitish Kumar may be a senior leader, but in terms of public support and vote bank, Upendra Kushwaha is a bigger leader than Nitish Kumar

 Not only Geelani, but also his son-in-law have been badly involved in the investigation of NIA after 'aaj Tak' sting operation on Terror funding

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par virdohi tanj kasne se koi mauka nahin chhodte hai
 Recently, after the news of Kejriwal going into Vipassana from September 10, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has made a fierce attack
 tiwari ne kaha ki dilli kejariwal ke vyavhaar se trast he
 It would be better if Kejriwal goes into permanent vipassana
 aapako bataa den ki kejariwal har saal sehat durust rakhane ke liye duniya kii sabase pracheenatam swasthya paddati vipasana ke liye alag-alag jagahon par jate rahe hai
 Go to Permanent Vipasana Kejriwal Manoj Tiwari, while being the Chief Minister of Nerwind Kejriwal, questioned not having a single department with him for two and a half years and said that 'kejriwal was in Vipassana without working for two and a half years, was just the Chief Minister of the name, no portfolio Was
 kejariwal ne jahaan jahaan dhyaan diya chaahe punjab ho yaa goa, vahaan kii safalataa kaa rate sab dekh chuke hai
 Tiwari said that Arvind Kejriwal should go to Permanent Vipassana and get re-election in Delhi so that people choose their leader
 virodhiyon ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue 'aap' vidhayak sanjeev jha ne apane mukhyamantri kaa bachaav kiya
 He said that 'arvind Kejriwal has been going for Vipassana for the last 20 years, not today
 isamen koi badi baat nahin he
 Opponents will continue to raise questions, their job is to raise questions
 lekin sarkaar main bahut tezi se kaam chal rahaa he or chalata rahegaa
 On the question of cm's new responsibility, Jha said that it is not about responsibility
 mukhyamantri rahete hue bhi arvind kejariwal jal board kii meeting liya karte the
 He said, i believe that there should not be so much ruckus by Kejriwal ji going on 10 days leave
 '10 din ke liye vipasana par jaaenge kejarivalapako bataa den ki is baar arvind kejariwal 10 sitambar ko maharashtra main mumbai ke najadik igatpuri main vipasana centre main jaaenge
 Where he will stay for 10 days

 For these 10 days, the Chief Minister of Delhi will neither have a newspaper, nor will he be allowed to use the TV or mobile phone at the Vipassana Center
 10 dinon ke vipasana satr ke dauraan dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko kisi se baat karne tak kii ijaajat bhi nahin hogi
 On Monday, for the first time in two and a half years, he took responsibility of any department other than the Chief Minister and summoned the top officials and asked for the report
 vipasana satr ke baad kejariwal kya phir kisi nai raajnneetik ladaai kaa aagaaj karenge, yah unke aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 Defending the Indian cricket team, which was critical of critics by performing poorly on the England tour, the legendary Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has said that the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team has the potential to reach the number one crown again
 england daure par bharat test siries 0-4 or vanade siries 0-3 se haar gaya, jisase team isisi test ranking main tisare or vanade ranking main paanchaven sthaan par khisak gai
 Speaking to Colombo, Muralitharan said, the Indian team is the best
 england daure se thik pehle yah apane sarvshereshth form main thi
 It was just a bad series, so that the team's ability cannot be questioned
 australia ke khilaaf bharat ke paas vaapasi kaa mauka he, chunki australian team bhi ab pehle jaisi aparaajey nahin he
 He said, many of India's top players were injured, so it was not the best Indian team
 kai baar aisa hota he or aise daur kaa saamana har team ko karnaa padataa he
 i am sure Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will again reach number one
 test cricket main sarvaadhik 800 wicket lene vaale is gendbaaj ne haalanki bharat ke flop sho ke liye atyadhik cricket or ipel ko kasuurvaar tehraane se inkaar kiya
 "I don't think excessive cricket is the reason," he said

 An injury is part of a player's career
 dilli main sarkaar or police ke bich chal rahi tanatani ke baad ab adhikariyon ke saath bhi maamla garma gaya he
 The suspension has been increased by the Delhi government suspending two officials of DANICS, who did not sign a Cabinet note
 is faisle se sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich phir setakaraar badhane ke asarahain, kyonki senior adhikariyon ko suspend karne kaa adhikaar sirf uparajyapal ko he, jo grih mantralay kii anumati milane ke baad hi aisa kar sakate hai
 Angered by this decision of the government, all the officials of Danix have announced to go on a day off
 nilamban ke khilaaf MHA ko chittheedhanichhsh adhikariyon ko suspend kiye jane ke dilli sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf kendriya grih mantralay ko chitthee likhi gai he
 The letter calls for the suspension
 is sambandh main ab tak grih mantralay kii ore se koi bayaan saamne nahin aayaa he
 The IAS Association has also decided in the IAS Association meeting held on Wednesday regarding the suspension of the support officers, that all the officers will be on leave for half a day on Thursday and will return to work after lunch
 IAS association ne danix adhikariyon ko suspend kiye jane ke virodh main yah faisla liya he
 IAS officials have also supported the proposal passed by Danix
 satyendra jain ne kii suspend kiye jane kii pushtijankaree ke mutabik, suspend kiye gaye donon adhikari yashpal garg or subhash chandra special secretary ke pad par karyrat the
 He is the highest-grade administrative officer
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki cabinet ke jis note par donon adhikariyon ne hastakshar karne se manaa kiya he vah, sarkari vakeelon or jail staff ke vetan main badhottaree se judaa he
 Delhi government minister Satyendra Jain has also confirmed the suspension of both officials
 kya he niyam?niyamon ke mutabik, sirf raashtrapati ko hi in karmchaariyon kii selary tay karne kaa adhikaar he
 Although the notification in this regard can be issued with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor, the minister pressured the officials to sign the notification without the permission of the Lieutenant Governor
 niyamon kaa hawala dete hue adhikariyon ne hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya kyonki khud uparajyapal ne bhi unhen hidaayat de rakhi he ki unki sahmati ke bina aise kisi bhi kaagaj par hastakshar naa kiye jaaen
 The Danics Association immediately convened the meeting
 Angered by the suspension of both officials, the Danics Association immediately called the meeting
 baithak main faisla liya gaya ki donon ke samarthan main sabhi adhikari guuruuvaar ko samuhik chuttee par jaaenge
 It was also decided in the meeting that the officers should be allowed to work independently and their work should not be obstructed, for this the association will raise its voice
 association ne sabhi adhikariyon se chuttee ke liye aavedan karne ko kaha he
 Further strategy will be met on Thursday evening

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, while advocating the promotion of Sanskrit language, said here today that Sanskrit is the most scientific language
 duniya ke anya deshon ke vidwaan bhi sanskrit ko sabase adhik vaigyanik bhashaa ke rup main manyata de rahe hai
 Singh was addressing a function organized on the last day of his three-day visit to his parliamentary constituency, Lucknow, to celebrate the Sanskrit connectivity campaign launched by the National Sanskrit Institutions and Sanskrit Bharati to spread the Sanskrit language from door to door
 
 unhone kaha, 'sanskrit bhashaa ke granthon main darshanik sawaalon ke jawaab uplabdh he
 
 chaahe lalit sahitya ke baat ho, vigyaan athwa praudyogiki anya deshon ke vidwaan bhi sanskrit ko sarvaadhik upyogi bhashaa ke rup main sweekaar kar rahe hai
 Stating that the origin of all languages is Sanskrit, Singh said that NASA, which is making super computers, has spoken of Sanskrit being the most scientific language for computers
 unhone kaha, anya deshon ke vidwaan ek taraf sanskrit ke prati aakarshith ho rahe he
 Even students in America and England are learning Sanskrit
 magar vidmbana he ki bharat usase dur ho rahaa he
 Giving examples of words like butt and put in English, Singh said that Sanskrit is the most scientific language even in terms of spelling and pronunciation
 unhone kaha ki vibhinn bhashaaon ke uccharan main kshetravaar bhinnata sunai padati he, magar dhwani vigyaan par aadhaarit sanskrit kaa uccharan desh or duniya ke har bhaag main ek he
 While referring to the usefulness of Vedic mathematics, Singh said that he had included it in the course in 1991 as the Uttar Pradesh Education Minister, but later the government removed him from the syllabus
 unhone sanskrit granthon main nihit gyaan ko aadhunik samaaj kii unnati or safalataa kii seedhee bataate hue kaha ki is bhashaa ko ghar ghar tak pahunchaana he or yadi ichhashakti he to isamen kamyaabi jarur milegi

 Adult films are now limited to single screens
 "ravi ek nae trend kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai

 In November, the central government issued a new currency of 2000 rupees, denying the most prevalent currency of 500 and 1000 rupees as illegal
 beete 40 dinon se adhik samay se deshbhar main puraani karency ke badale nai karency lene kii hode machi he
 At the same time, the printing of new currency in the printing press of the Reserve Bank is going on non-stop
 iske baavjood aam aadmi ko koi raahat milti nahin dikhaai de rahi he
 It was a mistake to issue new notes of 500 and 1000 rupees of 2000 rupees, due to which, despite constant efforts in the last 40 days, the country is not taking the name of a currency crisis - know how
 
 
 1
 Before demonetisation, 500 and 1000 notes were the most prevalent in the country
 donon hi karency blikemani ke liye upyukt hone ke saath-saath rosemara ke kharch ke liye bhi sabase pasandida karency thi
 While spending 1000 rupees currency, there were some difficulties, but currency of 500 rupees was spent without any problem
 2
 After 8 November, the common man started getting a note of Rs 2000 from the ATM, while withdrawing from the bank, he got a maximum of five notes at one time (weekly withdrawal limit 24,000 but the actual limit on withdrawal once was only Rs 10,000)
 500 rupee kii nai karency kii chapai kaa kaam notebandi lagu hone ke baad shuru kiya gaya
 The exercise of the Reserve Bank was to try to bring the new currency of Rs 2000 into circulation after demonetisation
 3
 Due to limited quantity of 2000 new currency from bank and ATM, common man faced difficulties in cashing it
 is note ko chalaane ke liye unhen yaa to bada sauda kharidne kii majaburi saamne ai nahin to ghar ke bagal ke ritel store main bhavishya kii kharidari karne ke liye 2000 kii note girvee rakhni padi
 The issue of 100 and 50 new notes with the new note of 2000 rupees also did not work
 4
 Due to demonetisation, the common man got deposited in the bank from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh lying in the emergency fund
 isse logon main immergency fund ke taur par ek baar phir 2000 kii nai note ko ghar main rakhane kii jarurat mahasoos hui
 This had a direct effect on increasing the liquidity in the market from the 2000 note by the banks and people got the 2000 note as an emergency fund in their homes as per their requirement
 5
 Demonetisation was expected to hit the businessmen, politicians and officials who are the biggest blackmoney in the country
 arthvyavastha main yah sabase bada tabaka tha jiske paas puraani 500 or 1000 rupee kii note main sarvaadhik blikemani sanchit thi
 a new currency of 2000 rupees issued by banks became a gift for this section
 jise bank main jugad yaa kamishan dekar nai note mili unhone badi dinomination kaa phayda uthaate hue apane kaledhan ko 2000 rupee kii nai note main surakshit kar liya
 The same section also accumulated limited currency reaching the common man as soon as he got his first chance
 kendra sarkaar ne 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency main desh kii kul 86 fisadi prachlit karency ko badalane ke liye sirf 2000 rupee kii nai karency kii istemaal kiya
 With this, the work of converting black money was easily possible along with practical difficulties
 vahiin notebandi kaa faisla sirf desh main bhrashtachar or kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye uthaaya gaya
 The central government and the Reserve Bank had to change the liquidity of the market through a new denomination of 50, 100 and 500 rupees instead of a large denomination of Rs 2000
 notebandi ke 40 din bitne ke baad rigerv bank ke aankade, or inakam tex vibhaag or sibiai kii chhaapon main baraamad ho rahe 2000 ke note saaf sanket de rahe hai ki notebandi ke liye bade dinomination kii karency utaarna mahaj ek bhul thi

 If the results of the exit poll are accepted as true, then not only Congress but all political parties have to think that they are fought to win elections and not to defeat the slogan of democracy
 2019 ke liye rahul gandhi kis taiyaari se ab khud ko taiyaar karenge, sabaki nazren ab isi par hongi

 An eye on the elections, though Nitish has downplayed the importance of the old equation of caste and communalism, but he has not been able to completely abandon it
 unke andar kaa netaa jaanata he ki agle loksabhaa chunaavon main agar jediu kii siton kii sankhya badhaani he to unhen apana gathbandhan ko sahi-salaamat rakhana hoga
 The JDU-BJP alliance is sure to win in terms of vote share
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main donon ko milakar kareeb 40 pratishat vot mili the, jiske bal par ve bihar kii 80 pratishat siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahe the
 If they break away from the alliance, Nitish could lose around 16–17 per cent of the votes that the BJP got in the 2010 assembly elections
 unhen savarnon kaa vot bhi khona pad saktaa he, jo bijepi ko vot dete hai or haal main nitish sarkaar se unka mohabhang hua he
 This is a big reason, due to which Nitish is reluctant to break away from BJP
 nitish agar bijepi se alag hona chaahate hai, to unhen 16 pratishat muslim voton ko apane paksh main karnaa hoga
 As long as Nitish is with the BJP, Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD will continue to garner votes from a large section of minorities
 voton ke maamle main bijepi ke mukaable congress se nitish ko zyada phayda nahin hone vaala he
 In the last assembly election, the Congress got only 8 percent votes
 nitish ke liye congress kii ore kadam badhaane kii koshish kii vajah vipakshi takaton ke gathjod ko rokna ho sakati he—nitish agar akele chunaav ladate hai to argedy-algepi-congress kaa gathjod unhen haraa saktaa he
 Nitish certainly wants to keep Lalu battered and also refute the notion that Lalu is slowly regaining his hold in Bihar
 nitish kii adhikaar yatra or bijepi kii prastaavit hunkaar raily ke khilaaf parivartan yatra shuru kar chuke lalu kii jansabhaon main kaaphi bheed jute rahi he
 State intelligence sources confirm that Lalu's rallies have been crowded by 10,000 people, compared to barely 2,000 in his meetings five years ago
 congress ke saath jane ke nuksaancongress ke saath gathjod banane ke duusare nuksaan bhi hai
 According to a close aide of Nitish, he does not want to be part of the upa's infamy in the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava jediu ke cader ke liye, jo jepi andolan ke samay congress ke dhur virodh se paidaa hua tha, us congress ke saath janaa mushkil hoga, jiskaa ve har baat main virodh karte rahe hai

 One thing is certain that Nitish does not want to put forward his name as the prime ministerial candidate in the next elections
 ve kisi baat kii hadabdaahat dikhaate najar nahin aa rahe hai
 According to a senior party MP, Nitish often keeps on saying that the Chief Minister who craves for the post of Prime Minister is not even able to become the Chief Minister later

 Simply, it requires that it is healthy and meets certain standards
 agar aapako koi beemaari he yaa aap koi dawa le rahe hai to behatar hoga ki raktadan se pehle apane chikitsak se salaah le len or raktadan ke liye ho rahi jaanch ke samay puri jaankaree den
 Dr
 snehal ne kaha ki haemoglobin kaa str sahi ho or sehat ke maanak par khare utarane kii sthiti main mahilaayein bhi raktadan kar sakati hai

 Neighbors reported that the flat door was open

 Neighbors were skeptical when a person did not appear in the flat for several days, and only the old mother's groaning voices came
 unhone ghar ke bheetar jaakar dekha to pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 An old woman lay in bed restless with hunger and thirst
 unhen hafte bhar se dawaai dene vaala bhi koi nahin tha or unki haalat behad najuk dikhaai pad rahi thi

 navaratri hindooon kaa ek pramukh tyohaar he
 Navratri is a Sanskrit word meaning 9 nights
 yah tyohaar saal main do baar aata he
 One is Sharadiya Navratri, the other is Chaitriya Navratri
 parantu sharadiya navaratri kaa mahatv adhik mana jaataa he
 The nine nights of Navaratri worship the nine forms of the three Hindu goddesses - Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati called Navadurga
 shakti kii upasnakti kii upasna kaa parv sharadeya navaratri pratipada se navami tak nau tithi, nau nakshatra, nau shaktiyon kii bhakthi ke saath sanathan kaal se manaaya ja rahaa he
 Sriramchandraji first started this Sharadiya Navaratri Puja on the beach and then departed and conquered Lanka for the tenth day
 tab se asaty, adharm par satya, dharm kii jeet kaa parv dashahra manaaya jane laga
 Each form of Adishakti is worshiped differently in the nine days of Navratri respectively
 maa durga kii nauveen shakti kaa naam siddhidatri he
 They are going to give all kinds of achievements
 inkaa vaahan singh he or camel pushp par hi asin hoti hai
 They are worshiped on the ninth day of Navratri
 ye to aap jaanate hi honge ki navadurga or das mahavidhaon main kaali pramukh hai
 Fiery and gentle in the powers of Lord Shiva, the ten superficialities, which take many forms in two forms, are capable of providing infinite siddhis
 dasven sthaan par kamala vaishnavi shakti hai, jo prakritik sampattiyon kii adhishthatri devi lakshmi hai
 Gods, humans, demons are all incomplete without their grace, so they are worshiped equally in both agama-nigam
 sabhi devtaa, rakshas, manushya, gandharva inaki krupa-prasad ke liye lalayit rahete hai
 Regarding the worship of mother in the Navratras, it is believed that the Gods also worship the mother Bhagwati
 navaratri main maa bhagwati ke nau vibhinn rupon kii puja kii jaati he
 Mother Bhagwati has been called Shakti
 navaratri main mata kii puja karne ke liye maa bhagwati kii pratimaa ke saamne kisi bade bartan main ret bharkar usamen jau ugane ke liye rakhe jate hai

 navaratri par prachlit kathaennavaratri par kai kathaayen or kivdantiyaan prachilit hai
 Prominent among these are as follows: Chandi Poojan of Rama and Ravana - In the war, Brahmaji asked Shri Ram to worship Chandi Devi for Ravana's slaughter and please Goddess
 unhone ja kuch bataaya uske anusaar chandi pujan or havan hetu durlabh 108 neelkamal kii vyavastha kii gai
 On the other hand, Ravana also started Chandi recitation with the desire of victory in the greed of immortality
 yah baat indra dev ne pawan dev ke madhyam se shriram ke paas pahunchaai or paraamarsh diya ki chandi paath yathasabhav purna hone diya jaae
 Here in the Havan material, a Neelkamal from the place of worship disappeared from the elusive power of Ravana and Ram's resolve began to appear broken
 bhay is baat kaa tha ki devi maa rusht na ho jaaen
 The arrangement of the rare Neelkamal was immediately impossible, then Lord Rama readily remembered that people called him 'kamalanayan Navakancha Lochan', so why not offer an eye for fulfillment
 prabhu ram jaise hi tunir se ek baan nikaalkar or apana netra nikaalane ke liye taiyaar hue, tab devi ne prakat hokar ram kaa haath pakadaa or kaha- ram main aapse bahut prasann hum
 Along with this, Goddess blessed Vijayashree with Rama
 devi-mahisasur sangramnavaratri se judi ek katha ke anusaar devi durga ne ek bhens rupi asur arthath mahisasur kaa vadh kiya tha

 mahisasur kaa naash karne ke liye sabhi devataaon ne apane apane astr devi durga ko die the or kaha jaataa he ki in devataaon ke sammilit prayaas se devi durga or balavaan ho gayi thi
 During these nine days the goddess-mahishasura war took place and finally Mahishasura-slaughter was called Mahishasura Mardini
 kis din kis rup kii karen upasna or kya lagaaein bhoganavaratri ke nau din devi ke vibhinn swaroopon kii upasna ke liye nirdhaarit hai
 These goddesses are pleased with the worship of the devotees and fulfill their wishes

 Congress leader Chandra Prakash Joshi was born on 29 July 1950 in Nathdwara, Rajasthan
 inhone lau main degree, bhautikee main masters degree ke saath- saath manovigyaan main doctoret kii oopaadhi praapt kii hui he
 Joshi started his academic career as a psychology professor at m College, Udaipur
 vahiin agar baat karen inke raajnneetik karier kii to isaki shuruuaat ek chaatr netaa ke rup main kii
 He was first elected as an MLA from Nathdwara Assembly seat in Rajsamand district in the year 1980
 congress vidhayak rahete hue inhone shiksha, gramin vikaas, lok swasthya, soochna praudyogiki jaise vibhaagon kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 He was instrumental in introducing computer education in the state
 rail mantri, sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantri ke rup main trinmul congress ke netaa mukul roy ke istife ke baad chandra prakaash joshi ko railway kaa atirikt prabhaar diya gaya tha
 On the issue of Article 370, the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Center was disappointed with its ally Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United
 loksabhaa or rajyasabha donon sadanon main janata dal united ke netaaon ne na keval virodh main bhaashan diya balki sadan kaa bahishkaar bhi kiya
 While the seriousness of the issue and the public's feeling towards the government among the common people, then opposition parties like BSP, Aam Aadmi Party came forward in support of the government
 lekin sawaal he ki is sabake baavjood akhir is mudde par apni party kii puraane line or siddhant par nitish kyon tike rahe
 For this, you have to know the comment of a senior BJP leader on an event of five years
 yah baat 18 may 2014 kii he jab loksabhaa chunaav main maatr do siton par simat jane ke baad nitish kumaar ne apane istife kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 After that everyone seemed that they had only completed the formalities of resignation and they would withdraw their resignation in the next one to two days
 tab bihar bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne ek patrkaar ko phone kiya or patrkaar ke yah kehane par ki party ke netaaon ke dabaav main nitish ji istifa waapas lene ko majaboor honge, bhaajapa netaa ne kaha tha ki aap galatafahami main hai
 i know they are very stubborn
 isliye ek baar faisalaa liya he to mukhyamantri to koi or hoga
 However, at the same time another BJP BJP leader Sushil Modi's tweet came that resignation is a drama and Nitish cannot leave his chair
 lekin nitish nahin maane unhone apni jagah jeethanram maanjhi ko kursi par bithaaya lekin istipha waapas nahin liya
 This was the second time in the past week when Janata Dal United, under the direction of Nitish Kumar, refused to reconsider its stand, whether it was a triple divorce case or a 370 issue proposed by the central government
 loksabhaa main to jediu ke sansadeey dal ke netaa rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh ne saafe-saafe kaha ki aap aatankwaad ke kilaaf ladaai uske sambandh main kuch bhi qadam uthaaen, ham aapke saath hai
 But you should not have raised this controversial issue
 nishchit rup se yah line nitish kumaar kii hi rahi hogi jinhone lalu yadav or congress party ke saath mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar main hone ke baavjood apane or doctor lohia ke siddhanton ke anusaar note bandi kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time, when the surgical strike took place, he was the leader of the first opposition who supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move
 sargical strike or notebandi par nitish ke us stand se na keval unke sahyogi balki tab unki party main maujuud sharad yadav jaise netaa kaafii asahaj ho gaye the
 He also urged Nitish Kumar to reconsider his stand
 lekin nitish us samay bhi tus se mas nahin hue
 It is different that he expected that at least 3-4 lakh crore rupees will not be returned to the system after the closure and the central government will reissue the same amount of notes that will be spent on development, which benefits states like Bihar Can get it
 lekin na nau man tel hua na radha naachi
 Nitish Kumar does not forget to say that there can be no compromise with crime, corruption and communalism
 jab unke up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav par bhrashtachar ke aarope lage or rajd unke istife ke liye taiyaar nahin hui to nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir istifa diya or bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaai
 During the last two years, BJP leaders have come to realize that under the guise of the government, if they give vent to communal incidents, angry Nitish Kumar will not compromise
 iskaa pramaan tab saamne aayaa jab navada or samastipur main police ne ek saath kai bijepi netaaon ko ramanavami ke dauraan sampradayik ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar maanate hue jail bhej diya
 Though the leaders of Janata Dal United also believe that they were all minor issues, this time this issue can be very profitable for the BJP and it can also be harmful due to the stand of Janata Dal United
 bhaajapa ne chunaav ke samay kiya gaya vaada puraa kiya he
 There is a lot of enthusiasm among the people about the way he suddenly passed the bill in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
