 ü§∞üèªthis one's for all who have shown me unconditional love during this sensitive journey: To friends who care, to the strangers who offer me to jump the shopping queues, to the store attendants who run to offer a chair, to the security guards who switch off the scanners so the baby is safe, to fans who endlessly and lovingly wait for my posts just to shower their love on me, to mommy who pays a surprise visit with my favourite halwa, to family that's in preparation every moment to welcome the new member, to the staff at home who doesn't let me bend to pick up stuff, to my music sir who lets me attend class with millions of pillows around me and above all to my partner who freezes at night inside umpteen layers of quilts so i can sleep in a comfortable temperature, who holds my hand every step of the way and without whom i would never be fortunate enough to experience this magic inside and around me and of course to the little angel growing inside me always reminding me of how much power nature has bestowed upon me, the power of being a woman, the power of procreation
 THANK YOU GOD for so many priceless joys üôèüèª Thank u @rohitkverma for this bespoke pregnancy dress He had said, 'whatever we wish we have received from God's blessing so far, but the life created by God is a unique thing in itself, now a beautiful new aspect of our life is about to begin

 Later, the SHO came out and pacified the people by giving them fair and prompt action
 darasal, nihaal vihaar thana kshetra ke kunwar singh nagar se ek maah pehle ek dhai saal keebacchiayushi ko kisi ne agava kar liya tha

 All the people raised slogans against the Delhi Police with banners and planks in their hands
 parijanon kaa saaf kahana he ki ghar ke baahar khel rahi bacchee kaa kidnape hua tha
 CCTV footage of the accused was also given to the police but so far nothing had happened in the case
 police bacchee kaa koi suraag nahin laga pai he
 Family members fear that their daughter has been murdered or if the girl has not been sold
 ab bacchee ke parijan uski tasviir haathon main lekar police se vinati kar rahe hai ki unki bacchee ko waapas laa do
 The girl's mother says that the police have not helped her

 bollywood actor anil kapur kii fitness or unka energy level aaj bhi logon ko sarprise kar detaa he

 lakhanu main gomti ke kinare jhulelaal park main 13 aktubar ko juty musalamaanon ke andar pichhadi birdariyon kii baari bheed muslim samaaj main chal rahe antarvirodh kaa sandesh de rahi thi
 On one side, there are 36 fraternities like socio-economically weak Mansuri, Qureshi, Idrisi, Rhiney, and on the other hand, they are forwarded as Sheikh, Syed, Pathan and Shia
 chunki 85 pratishat musalmaan pichhadi birdariyon ke hai, isiilie voton ke guna-bhaag main lageen siyaasi partiyon ne in par apni nazren gada di hai
 Last month, when Chief Minister Mayawati sent a letter to the Prime Minister demanding reservation to the Muslim society according to its population, it became clear that its issues in the upcoming elections would be on the lines of the previous elections
 aarakshan kii maang kar musalamaanon main basapa kaa janaadhar badhaane ke liye mayawati kii yah koi pehali koshish nahin thi
 Apart from this, Mayawati has entrusted senior party leader Nasimuddin Siddiqui to connect with Muslims
 party netaa jorshor se tark de rahe hai ki basapa sarkaar ke kaarykaal main pradesh main ek bhi sampradayik danga nahin hua
 Muslim population in the state 18
 5 fisadi he
 In 70 assembly constituencies, they are 20 percent or more
 pashchimi uttar pradesh kii 20, purvi uttar pradesh kii 10, madhya kii 5 or bundelkhand kii ek seat par muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya 30-45 pratishat ke bich he
 In such a situation, the SP was the most feared to pull the Muslims towards the BSP
 1992 main babari masjid dhwans ke baad dedh dashak tak vah musalamaanon kii pasandida party bani rahi
 In the last Lok Sabha elections, the Muslim's inclination towards SP became somewhat weak, so with the hope of fixing it in the next assembly election, the SP has also started its preparations
 party ke varisht netaa mohammad ajam khan yahaan centre main congress kii sarkaar ko musalamaanon kaa dushman qaraar dete hai to basapa kii ore sawaal uchhaalate hai ''muslim aarakshan kii maang karne vaali mukhyamantri mayawati yah bataaen ki unhen aisa karne se kisne roka he?''party ne sarkaar banane par muslimon ko aarakshan dene ke saath muslim bahul ilaakon main skool-college kholane kii baat kahi he
 But the way in which the war between the Rajya Sabha MP Qazi Rashid Masood and Azam Khan has erupted in SP, Muslim voters will not be surprised if they get further away from the party in the next assembly elections
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ko 46 fisadi musalamaanon ke vot mili the par do saal baad loksabhaa chunaav main yah aankada ghatakar 30 pratishat rah gaya tha
 This time, on the issue of reservation, as the Muslims are seen to be united, the BJP is also trying its best to bring them to their side
 beete 20 saal main party kisi muslim pratyaashee ko pradesh vidhansabha kii choukhat paar nahin karvaa pai he
 It is a matter of relief for him that while 2 per cent of the Muslims had voted for the BJP in the 2007 assembly elections, the figure had risen to 6 per cent in the Lok Sabha
 pichley dinon lakhanu main alpsankhyak swabhimaan sammelan main juty bheed se utsahit bhaajapa musalamaanon ke kam-se-kam 10 fisadi vot par apana daawa pesh kar rahi he
 The Congress, which has been the biggest gainer in the past Lok Sabha elections in terms of Muslim votes, has not yet come up with an effective agenda for them
 pradesh main party abhi bhi puri tarah se congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par nirbhar he
 Recently, a delegation of the State Congress under his leadership met the Prime Minister and demanded to waive the debts of the weavers
 buudhvaar ko bundelkhand daure ke antim din rahul gandhi ne ek muslim parivaar ke ghar raat bitaakar alpsankhyakon ko rijhaane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Actually Congress does not have any Muslim face in the state
 mohasina kidawai musalamaanon kii puraani netaa hai, ajaharuddin, jafar ali nakvi saansad hai, naseeb pathan vidhaan parishad main party ke netaa hai par party ne saansad salmaan khurshid ko centre main cabinet mantri kaa darja dekar muslim voton par apni daavedaari pesh kii he
 The party entangled in the ticket distribution has not yet organized a big event to connect the minorities
 badi partiyon ke liye is baar musalamaanon ke vot paanaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 There are also reasons for this
 musalamaanon kii pichhadi jamaaten ab na keval ekajute ho rahi hai balki inke bheetar se netritv bhi ubharkar saamne aa rahaa he
 Dr
 of this class mohammad ayub or unki pis party ko is nazariye se dekha ja saktaa he
 The Peace Party, which contested for the first time in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, fielded candidates in 21 parliamentary constituencies
 haalanki uskaa ek bhi ummidavaar vijayi nahin hua lekin party ne 4 fisadi vot paakar sabakaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa tha
 The National Ulama Council, which has shown its strength in Azamgarh and Jaunpur in the last Lok Sabha elections, is also contesting the assembly elections for the first time
 party alpsankhyakon kii lagaataar badtar hoti haalat ko to uthaa rahi he lekin isaki ladaai musalamaanon ko unki pahchaan dilaane ke liye bhi he
 a large number of backward Muslims gathered in Jhulelal Park under the banner of non-political organization Rashtriya Pasmanda Muslim Society tried to give the message that the politics of backward minorities will now be done by them
 samaaj ke rashtriya adhyaksh anis mansuri kehete hai, ''pichde musalamaanon ko unki aabaadi ke hisaab se kisi bhi manch par pratinidhitiv nahin mila he
 If they get adequate participation in power, they will progress on their own
 ab musalamaanon kii 15 fisadi agadi jatiyaan 85 fisadi pichhadi jatiyon kaa netritv nahin kar saktin
 '' Also Dr

 It is clear that this time the concerns of Muslim voters have changed
 ab ve jajbaat kii aandhi main nahin udne vaale
 These voters want their rights
 pichhadepan kaa dansh jhel rahe musalmaan ab isse nijaat paanaa chaahate hai
 They are demanding reservation to get a place in the society
 in par ab kisi party kaa thappa nahin he balki ve sabhi party, netaaon ko parakh rahe hai shaayad inamen se hi unhen apana 'ambedkar' mil jaae

 What has happened to Xi Jinping? Why have you fallen behind corruption by putting growth aside? The annoyance was that of a large foreign investor who had recently returned from Beijing and was badly incensed by China's new economic reforms
 koi sarkaar apni hi party ke 1
 82 lakh officials have already taken action against corruption, this is not common for any country
 us par bhi agar china kii sarkaar apni kaddavar communist party ke bade netaaon va sena adhikariyon ke bhrashtachar ke khilaaf swatchta abhiyaan chalaa rahi ho to achraj kai guna bad jaataa he, kyonki bhrashtachar china kii vishaal aarthik mashin kaa tel-pani he
 It is unnatural for investors that China is not only bringing the lowest growth achieved by 24 years at the lowest level of 24 years to prevent monopoly and increase transparency in the market, but is also considering it as normal (new Normal)

 The dispute between actor Salman Khan and singer Arijit Singh is quite old
 is vivaad kii vajah se arijit ko salmaan kii kai filmon main gane kaa mauka milane ke baavjood ganvaana padaa
 But Arijit fulfilled these occasions by hand in his concert recently
 darasal arijit ne salmaan ke hit number 'dil diyaan gallaan' ko stage parfomens ke dauraan gaaya
 According to reports, Arijit was supposed to sing this song in the film, but due to the displeasure of Dabangg Khan, this opportunity was lost from his hand
 aise main is khubasurat gane ko arijit ne stage par gaaya, jise phens ne kaaphi pasand kiya
 The video of this hit song in Singer's voice has gone viral on socialmedia these days
 bataa den in dinon arijit singing tour par nikle hai, unhone apane kai superhit number phens ko sunaae
 At the same time, he also fulfilled the desire to sing songs that were left out of his hands for some reason
 film tiger jinda he ke original number dil diyaan gallaan ko film main pakistani singer aatif asalam ne gaaya he
 This is how salman-arijit's differences started in 2014
 Reason why Arijit Singh had to apologize
 Looks like Salman can't take a joke & never forgetspic
 twitter
 com / q3vki2fkub ‚Äî Aditya (@forwardshortleg) May 25, 2016 The feud between Salman and Arijit began during the Guild Awards in 2014
 aword sho ke dauraan aashiqui 2 film ke gane tum hi ho ke liye best plabac singer aword ke taur par arijit ko chunaa gaya
 Salman Khan and Ritesh Deshmukh were present on the stage to give the award, which was also hosting the show
 arijit ne salmaan se kaha ki aap logon ne sula diya yaar, is par salmaan ne tum hi gane kii dhun gaate hue kaha ki agar tum aise hi gane gaaoge to neend hi aegi
 Salman responded to Arijit's words in a funny way, but perhaps this attitude of Arijit in the heart of the actor has gone home
 is vaakye ke baad film sultan main jab salmaan dwaara arijit ke gane ko hataae jane kii khabaren charchaa main raheen tab arijit ne fasebuk par ek lanbaa post likhakar khud ko bhaijan kaa fain bataate hue unase maafee maangani chaahi lekin salmaan kaa is par koi jawaab nahin aya
 This resentment of Sultan Salman Khan has not yet gone away

 Taslima Nasreen Khasi of Bangladeshi origin is notable among the creators of the Indian subcontinent who have received global discussion due to their creative intentions
 vah apni jeevanstyli or lekhan main jis prakaar ke akunth vidroh kaa paryaay baniin uske kaaran unhen na keval apaar pidaa or aghaton ke baad antat: satat nirvaasan kii traasadee jhelni padi, balki sthaayee taur par 'niztaa ke ghar' main simatakar bandi kaa sa jivan sweekaar karnaa padaa parantu bhautik dharaatal kii tamaam acolpaneey or kathor paristhitiyon ke baavjood, tasalima kaa antaraman ek aisi stri kaa antaraman he, jahaan sampurna mukti kii laalasaa adamya he or mahatvapurn yah he ki unki is laalasaa ke bheetar ke sarokaar samaaj vyavasthaaon or naitikta ke vyapkatam vistaar ko aabaddh karte hai
 Taslima Nasreen's new Hindi compilation 'me Dena Aur Prem' is a document expressing her unusual life and intense impulsive experiences
 is sankalan main tasalima kii jivan yatra ko spashtatya is taur par dekha ja saktaa he ki unka vidroh or sangharsh sahaj or naiysargik prem se sanwalit he
 Taslima's love is fervent and boisterous
 agaadh or achor
 This love takes its path away from all taboos, beliefs and prevailing beliefs
 tasalima kaa yah anoothaa aviral prem behad sanshlisht or bahurupi he jisamen hajaar rangon or rangaton vaala ek vishaal sansar he
 Entering this world, i am interviewed by a stubborn woman named Taslima, whose heart is seated in the ocean and her world of impulse is not only about her happiness and sorrow, but in it the misery and duality of all humanity
 Are beating
 yahi kaaran he ki adhikanshat: prem kavitaaon ke is sankalan kii pehali kavita eent todgaye vaali ek ladki ke bare main he, jise saare din inten todgaye ke evaj 10 ru
 See you unheen 10 rupayon se saat logon ke uske parivaar kii hnudha shant honi he
 a male laborer, sitting under the umbrella of an umbrella, a little away next to the girl, is paid Rs
 20 for the same work
 milte hai
 Here the taboo on the evil of gender inequality is easily put on the finger
 kavita ke uttararddh main hamen ladki kii apuri ichchhaaon kii katha milti he or ek karun sur par kavita kaa ant hota he ki 'ksht the / sab karte nahin use ab sparsh
 In fact, Taslima has some simple categories of cognate reality
 tarah-tarah ke dukhon kii ek badi shrenee he, jisamen tasalima apni nijee hataasha or dukh ke alaava or kai tarah ke dukhon ko unki vaazib jagah detii hai
 Such sufferings are miscellaneous topics such as the suffering of the underprivileged, the suffering of the countries trampled by barbaric military force by US imperialism, the unacceptable brunt of the 1947 Partition of India and the poignant memory of her late mother through which she declares Amarsha
 
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke sahitya main aisi kavitaayen sthaayee nidhiyon kii tarah hoti hai
 All these varieties of sorrows and this category of Taslima are brutal inverse of love for Taslima, the love with which their soul is made
 dukh ke pratikaar kii anokhi vidhi-pravidhi bhi tasalima ke manodaihik prem jagat main he
 She admits depression, tenacity, feverishness, defeat and disillusionment, but her love's invincibility remains intact, as she seeks to achieve her 'love' overall by giving it all and often in her realization
 kampan shrinkhalaa kii choti kavitaaon main yah bhav khub vyakt hua he
 And it is also worth noting that the 'love' of Taslima also gets such an inhumane detail in her sentiment that she can say with disdain, 'there is happiness in my love, whether she / he wants me or not
' Accepting the antonym, regardless, she says, "it's nice to hurt you, two
" ''tasalima kii in prem kavitaaon main prem kaa nitant nijee kaayda bhi bade durlabh tareeke se viksit hua he ‚Äî'prem karne kii koi umr nahi hoti
 'she tells in a style of edification,' as in sixteen, in the same sixty / can flow love stream 'and in' Bachna Kavita ',' Premik ', says,' How did you think that age will take you Saved from love
 umr mere prem se bachaa na paaegi tumhen / prem tumhen bachaayegaa umr se
 'and then' Come here, like a good child, have / have my love
 'prem main dabdbai ankhon kii tarah tasalima kii ye kavitaayen atyant sanvedya or smritigrahyato hai hi, yah bhi sambhav he ki hindi ke samakaleen stri vimarsh ke bich inase kuch nae prashn or vichaar bindu paidaa hon
 With the endless agony of exile, Taslima has faced the worst aggressors of male sovereignty
 baavjood iske, unhone stri-purush ke naiysargik yugma or prem kaa jo anant swapn saheja he or uski jaisi andriya or yatharthparak chhaviyaan ukeri hai, ve nihsandeh viral or vilakshan hai
 Prem is her dream for Taslima
 is sankalan kii kuch kavitaayen‚Äî'ek akavita, 'maa ke ksht paane par hamaara kuch aata-jaataa nahin tha ', 'bumadhya sagar kii seagal, ' 'is ghar se us ghar main', 'asweekaar, ' 'america'‚Äîaisi hai, jinaki shreshthata vistrut charchaa kii adhikari hai

 Was Jacob guilty of 1993 blasts? If not, how, when and where did he surrender? Whatever decision the Supreme Court will take in the coming time, the whole matter will definitely be stuck on these two questions
 ro ke purv adhikari kaa lekh ishaara karata he ki yaqub kisi 'deal' ke tahat laayaa gaya tha
 Deals about which either intelligence agencies know or Yakub and his family
 puri kahani main yahi wo pench he jo sabase zyada pechida sawaal paidaa karata he
 For the sake of argument, suppose that Yakub was caught by the CBI from Delhi station, then why Aaj Tak agencies could not tell where Yakub used to live before he was caught at the station
 agar wo bharat main hi tha to jin logon ne panaah di wo koun the? zaahir si baat he aisa kuch tha hi nahin to bahes hi nahin uthi
 On the basis of logic, it is clear that he was in the grip of the police even before Yakub's arrest in Delhi
 jo log agenciyon ke kaamkaaj or taur tareekon ko jaanate hai unhen pataa he ki ye behad aam he ki koi aaropee paqadaa kahin bhi jaae uski giraftaar police apni suvidha ke hisaab se bataati he
 Yakub's family continues to say that he surrendered in Kathmandu
 
 
 yani nepal main hi sari gatividhiyaan huin hai
 For the sake of argument, suppose that an arrest has been made in Nepal itself, then questions arise that how did Yakub reach Pakistan from there? Even after reaching it, how was it caught? More big punches appear in the story of Yakub when it stops understanding that if Yakub was arrested and he was not ready then how did his family come back after all this? Why did all the people return? Didn't they know how Yakub was arrested? If they knew why did they all return after putting themselves in danger? chaliye kuch der ke liye maan lete hai ki hamaari agenciyon ne bargala kar yaqub or uske parivaar ko pakad liya or baad main unako sazaa dilaa di
 Now the big question arises that why did Jacob not tell from the beginning that he had surrendered, not caught? in tamaam pench or sawaalon ke jawaab darasal kanoonee prakriya main hai
 Judge PD Kode, who gave the verdict on the 1993 bomb blasts, says that Yakub has surrendered, he could not produce evidence
 bada sawaal he ki kya giraft main aane ke baad koi shaks saboot pesh kar saktaa he? jaj sahab kaa maananaa he ki adaalatein faisla saboot or bayanon ke aadhaar detii hai or yaqub naakaam rahaa khud ke sarender kii baat sabit karne main, jabaki sibiai ye bataa pai ki use giraftaar kiya he
 It is obvious that the court cannot have anything to do with which evidence was in Kathmandu and how they could not live with Yakub
 tippaniyan It is not that Yakub did not reveal his surrender to the judge
 jaj sahab ke mutabik siarpisi kii dhara 313 ke tahat mulgim ko sazaa ke baad bhi apni baat kehane kaa haq he or isi kaa istemaal karte hue yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat kahi
 But this is not done under any oath, so it has no legal significance
 pench kii kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti, ro ke afasar or yaqub ke bich jo kuch hua tha, wo adaalaton kii seemaa ke baahar hua he isliye uske aadhaar par raham kii gunjaaish kam hoti he, aise main sawaal yahi ki kya yaqub batch paaegaa faansee ke fande se? For the sake of argument, suppose that Yakub was caught by the CBI from Delhi station, then why Aaj Tak agencies could not tell where Yakub used to live before he was caught at the station
 agar wo bharat main hi tha to jin logon ne panaah di wo koun the? zaahir si baat he aisa kuch tha hi nahin to bahes hi nahin uthi
 On the basis of logic, it is clear that he was in the grip of the police even before Yakub's arrest in Delhi

 It is obvious that the court cannot have anything to do with which evidence was in Kathmandu and how they could not live with Yakub
 tippaniyan It is not that Yakub did not reveal his surrender to the judge
 jaj sahab ke mutabik siarpisi kii dhara 313 ke tahat mulgim ko sazaa ke baad bhi apni baat kehane kaa haq he or isi kaa istemaal karte hue yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat kahi
 But this is not done under any oath, so it has no legal significance
 pench kii kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti, ro ke afasar or yaqub ke bich jo kuch hua tha, wo adaalaton kii seemaa ke baahar hua he isliye uske aadhaar par raham kii gunjaaish kam hoti he, aise main sawaal yahi ki kya yaqub batch paaegaa faansee ke fande se? Yakub's family continues to say that he surrendered in Kathmandu
 
 
 yani nepal main hi sari gatividhiyaan huin hai
 For the sake of argument, suppose that an arrest has been made in Nepal itself, then questions arise that how did Yakub reach Pakistan from there? Even after reaching it, how was it caught? More big punches appear in the story of Yakub when it stops understanding that if Yakub was arrested and he was not ready then how did his family come back after all this? Why did all the people return? Didn't they know how Yakub was arrested? If they knew why did they all return after putting themselves in danger? chaliye kuch der ke liye maan lete hai ki hamaari agenciyon ne bargala kar yaqub or uske parivaar ko pakad liya or baad main unako sazaa dilaa di
 Now the big question arises that why did Jacob not tell from the beginning that he had surrendered, not caught? in tamaam pench or sawaalon ke jawaab darasal kanoonee prakriya main hai
 Judge PD Kode, who gave the verdict on the 1993 bomb blasts, says that Yakub has surrendered, he could not produce evidence
 bada sawaal he ki kya giraft main aane ke baad koi shaks saboot pesh kar saktaa he? jaj sahab kaa maananaa he ki adaalatein faisla saboot or bayanon ke aadhaar detii hai or yaqub naakaam rahaa khud ke sarender kii baat sabit karne main, jabaki sibiai ye bataa pai ki use giraftaar kiya he
 It is obvious that the court cannot have anything to do with which evidence was in Kathmandu and how they could not live with Yakub
 tippaniyan It is not that Yakub did not reveal his surrender to the judge
 jaj sahab ke mutabik siarpisi kii dhara 313 ke tahat mulgim ko sazaa ke baad bhi apni baat kehane kaa haq he or isi kaa istemaal karte hue yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat kahi
 But this is not done under any oath, so it has no legal significance
 pench kii kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti, ro ke afasar or yaqub ke bich jo kuch hua tha, wo adaalaton kii seemaa ke baahar hua he isliye uske aadhaar par raham kii gunjaaish kam hoti he, aise main sawaal yahi ki kya yaqub batch paaegaa faansee ke fande se? Let's assume for a while that our agencies tricked and captured Yakub and his family and later punished them
 ab bada sawaal uthta he ki yaqub ne shuru se hi ye kyon nahin bataaya ki usne sarender kiya he, pakadaa nahin gaya he? The answers to all these punches and questions are actually in the legal process
 1993 bam dhamaakon par faisla dene vaale jaj pidi kode kehete hai ki yaqub ne sarender kiya he, iske wo saboot pesh nahin kar sakaa
 The big question is, can someone present evidence after being arrested? The judge believes that the courts give the verdict based on evidence and statements and Yakub failed to prove his surrender, while the CBI was able to tell that he was arrested
 jaahir si baat he adaalat kaa isse lenaa dena nahin ho saktaa ki koun se saboot kathmandu main the or wo yaqub ke paas kaise nahin rah paae
 The comments aisa nahin he ki yaqub ne apane sarender kii baat jaj ko nahin bataai
 According to the judge, under Section 313 of the crpc, the accused has the right to speak even after the punishment and using this, Yakub spoke about his surrender
 lekin ye baat kisi shapath ke tahat nahin hoti isliye uskaa koi kanoonee mahatv nahin bachataa
 The story of the screw does not end here, everything that happened between the RAW officer and Yakub is outside the boundaries of the courts, so on the basis of this, Rahm's scope is less, so the question is whether Yakub will be saved from hanging

 Interestingly, the Twitter handle is followed by @exsecular in addition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, many central ministers Giriraj Singh, Piyush Goyal, Ramkripal Yadav and Vijay Goel

 Also, 'pale Blue Dot' is written in place of location
 share kii ja rahi chaar tasveeron main mantri jameer ahamed khan kele ke patton se khaanaa uthaakar apane haath se vardidhariyon ko khilaate dikh rahe hai
 When we contacted Khan and asked him about these pictures, he confirmed that they were real
 khan ne bataaya ki ye tasviren mysuru main 10 oktober ko khinchi gai, tab wo aadhikarik haisiyat se dashahra ke avasar par ‚Äòfood festival‚Äô kaa udghaatan karne gaye the
 Congress leader Khan, 51, told India Today, 'I inaugurated several food stalls at the Scouts and Guides ground in Mysuru on the occasion of Dussehra
 ye tasviir usee kaarykram kii hai
 When Khan was asked the reason for handing food to the policemen, he said that he has been doing this for more than 20 years before coming into politics
 mantri ne kaha, ‚Äòmain samajhataa hum ki isse bhaichara badhata he
 This is how i eat myself from the hands of others
 main aise bacchon ke saath khaanaa kha rahaa tha jinaki ankhon main roshni nahin thi
 Whoever was present there, i shared food with everyone including these policemen
 ‚Äôkhan ne jor dekar kaha ki aisa matlab nikaalnaa sahi nahin he ki unhone apane pattal (plate) se pulicekarmiyon ko khaanaa khaane ke liye majaboor kiya
 To find out the truth of what the minister claimed of the 'food sharing tradition', we searched his Facebook page and found videos of this program there
 in video main khan ko meetha obettu khud khate or kai logon ko khilaate dekha ja saktaa he
 Many old pictures can also be seen on the timeline of Facebook page, in which Khan is seen sharing similar food
 hamen is kaarykram ke sabandh main kuchhmedia reportsbhi milin ,jahaan unke sadbhaavna vaale kaam kii prashansa kii gai he
 Although many people did not like to share food in this manner, to say that Khan forced Hindu policemen to eat his louse is a completely false allegation, which could be aimed at hurting the brotherhood

 Blood moon- kuch bura hone kaa ehsaas yaa pratik / apshakun - shishe kaa tootna aam gharon main acha nahin mana jaataa

 4
 Cry for the moon- impractical and unreasonable demand- keep the hope that it can be fulfilled
 yaad rahe, kisi bhi surat main do not cry for the moon
 5
 Moon about someone or something- kisi cheez ko lekar niraash ho janaa- are bhai ab isamen itani pareshaan hone vaali baat thode na he

 Hence necessary steps are being taken based on the input of security agencies'

 Whenever a great figure has come to India, only the blood of innocent people has been shed in Kashmir
 pehle jab america raashtrapati bill clinton ke daure par chhattisinghpora kaa bhayanak khooni manjar dekhne main aayaa tha
 Although the US President has no program to visit Kashmir, people are scared
 1999 main jab bill clinton dilli aae the, tab aatankiyon ne chhattisinghpora main 36 kashmiri sikhon ko maar diya tha
 It has been 15 years for this incident, but the US President's three-day visit to India starting on January 25, has hurt the wounds of the people
 suraksha se jude adhikari koi risk nahin lenaa chaahate isliye kashmir main hai alert jari kiya gaya he
 Additional security forces have been deployed
 haalanki america ne bhi pakistan ko pehle hi cheta diya he ki wo is baat kaa dhyaan rakhe ki jab obama bharat main ho to aatanki seemaa paar se koi harakat na karen
 But the security forces who have received input that terrorists have been instructed from across the border must take such action during the US President's visit to India that the world can know that terrorists in Kashmir can take action wherever and whenever they want

 kejariwal ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki uttar pradesh sarkaar khurshid ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karegi, kyonki vah sarvocch nyaayalay main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main unke vakil hai
 He said that Mulayam's son Akhilesh Yadav is the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh
 donon ek-duusare ko bachaayenge
 On the other hand, the Congress did not miss any opportunity to defend Khurshid in view of allegations of financial irregularities on the trust

 In a letter to retired NBSA President Justice Justice JS Verma, Katju said that the India Today group has raised questions about financial irregularities in the Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust headed by Khurshid

 He said, "therefore, i request you to hear against Khurshid as well as India Today group and make your report public so that people can know the truth
" " Kejriwal also took some people with him, whose name was mentioned by Khurshid among those who got the equipment on Sunday
 lekin un logon ne somvaar ko isse inkaar kiya
 Kejriwal also alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government will not take action against Khurshid as he is his advocate in the disproportionate assets case against Samajwadi Party (SP) President Mulayam Singh Yadav in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main mulaayam ke bete akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri hai
 The two will save each other
 duusari ore, congress ne khurshid ke trust par lage vittiya aniyamittaaon ke aaropon ke maddenjar unka bachaav karne kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 The party has said that Khurshid is an important minister for the second term of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and has responded to the allegations
 kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri ambika soni ne kaha, "khurshid ne ravivaar ko apane samvaadadaata sammelan main sab kuch spasht kar diya
 
 mujhe nahin lagata ki is bare main kuch or kahe jane kii jarurat he
 " soni ne kaha, "khurshid ko alag-thalag karne yaa unka samarthan karne kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 
 vah samprag-2 ke mahatvapurn sadsy hai
 He has a reputation and should be proud of his legacy
 " Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was present with Soni, also said that the government is not keeping distance from Khurshid
 soni ne yah bhi kaha ki kendriya samaaj kalyaan mantralay ne khurshid ke trust kii uske kaaryo ke liye prashansa kii he or ise mantralay se anudaan mil rahaa he
 Earlier, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, while supporting Khurshid, questioned that the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) draft report alleging financial irregularities of Rs 71 lakh in a trust run by his wife was presented in Parliament
 How did the media get involved first? He said, "it is surprising how the CAG report reaches the media before it is placed in Parliament
" khaskar jab report congress ke khilaaf hoti he to yah sansad se pehle media ke paas pahunch jaati he
 It should be investigated who is leaking the report
 " unhone vyangyatmak lahaze main kaha, "sabhi jaanch kejariwal ko saunp di jaani chahie
 It is like saying that no document or description is correct, but what Kejriwal is saying is only correct
 " In another incident, Press Council of India (PCI) President Markandey Katju demanded that the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) investigate allegations of corruption against Khurshid
 enbiese ke adhyaksh sevanivrutt nyaayadhish nyamurti jees verma ko likhe patr main katju ne kaha ki india today samooh ne khurshid kii adhyakshata vaale jakir hossain memorial trust main vittiya aniyamitata ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye hai
 In response, Khurshid has also made allegations against India Today group
 tippaniyan Katju has said in a letter to Justice Verma, "people look at you with great respect

 " katju ne yah bhi kaha ki khurshid kaa maamla ekmaatr ghatana nahin he
 The media, especially the broadcast media, in a hurry to give breaking news many times, without full investigation, hurts the news which hurts someone's reputation
 unhone kaha, "isliye main aapse anurodh karata hum ki khurshid ke saath-saath india today samooh ke khilaaf bhi sunwaayee kar apni report saarvajanik karen, taaki logon ko sachai kaa pataa chal sake
 " kejariwal ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki uttar pradesh sarkaar khurshid ke khilaaf karrwai nahin karegi, kyonki vah sarvocch nyaayalay main samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main unke vakil hai
 He said that Mulayam's son Akhilesh Yadav is the chief minister in Uttar Pradesh
 donon ek-duusare ko bachaayenge
 On the other hand, the Congress did not miss any opportunity to defend Khurshid in view of allegations of financial irregularities on the trust

 The last day of the resolution in the UNHRC, Thapakistan failed to get the necessary support, Pakistan has once again been insulted on the international stage
 sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar parishad (UNHRC) main kashmir par prastaav pesh karne kaa aaj aakhri din tha, lekin pakistan aavashyak samarthan hasil karne main asafal rahaa
 According to sources, most of the members refused to support Pakistan to propose on Kashmir
 darasal, kashmir par prastaav pesh karne kii aaj aakhri taarikh thi, lekin pakistan aisa nahin kar paaya
 The proposal required the support of at least 16 countries
 duniya ke alag-alag deshon ke saamne jaakar kashmir kaa ronaa rone vaala pakistan samarthan jutaney main naakaam rahaa
 The 42nd session of UNHRC is going on in Geneva
 india today ko sutron ne bataaya ki pakistan nunatam samarthan jutaney main bhi naakaam rahaa
 What the regulation says is that minimum support is required before any country can take action on its proposal
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne islamabad se geneva ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle kashmir par prastaav kaa vaada kiya tha
 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has 15 countries in the UNHRC
 pakistan ko ummid thi ki vah iske baad samarthan juta legaa
 Even after managing a joint statement on the Kashmir issue, Islamabad could not garner votes
 pakistan ne isse pehle 10 sitambar ko UNHRC ko kashmir kii sthiti par ek sanyukt bayaan saunpa tha
 In this, he had spoken about the support of 60 countries, but he could not tell which countries are supporting him

 Proposal, debate or special session

 The special season may be the strongest option, but is also ruled out
 sutron ke mutabik, saamaanya satr jo 27 sitambar tak chalegaa, uske bich vishesh satr yojit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 At the same time, debate requires the support of at least 24 countries
 ye donon vikalp ati aavashyak maamle main hi hote hai
 Sources said that the matter on Kashmir is neither urgently needed nor it is serious even after eight weeks have passed since India has informed the Council and member states that the situation is under control and assured that sanctions will be relaxed

 The match will start tomorrow ie Sunday afternoon at 1:30 pm

 Team India's eyes will be on winning the 10th consecutive bilateral ODI series against the Caribbean team
 bharat ne haal hi main tii-20 siries main westeindies ko 2-1 se maat di he or ab uski nazren apane is form ko vanade siries main bhi jari rakhte hue is siries main bhi mehmaan team kaa patta saaf karne par hai
 Even before the series starts, however, the hosts have suffered two major setbacks
 openar shikhar dhawan or tej gendbaaj bhubaneshwar kumaar chotil hone ke kaaran pehle hi siries se baahar ho chuke hai
 Who will be Rohit's partner? Dhawan suffered a knee injury against Maharashtra in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy played in Surat
 dhawan kii jagah mayank agarwal ko bhartiya team main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In the absence of Dhawan, the responsibility of opening the innings in the ODI series can also be handed over to Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul
 dhawan chot se ab tak nahin ubar paae hai
 Mayank Agarwal has been included in the squad as an alternative to Dhawan and it remains to be seen if he gets a chance to make his ODI debut
 karnataka kaa yah ballebaaj test cricket main shandaar form main tha or dindigul main tamilnadu ke khilaaf ranjai trophy match khilne ke baad team se judaa he

 team ke gendbaaji coach bharat arun pehle hi yah kah chuke hai ki vah ek adarsh or santulit team par dhyaan de rahe hai
 Now it will be quite interesting to see that given the slow pitch of the Chennai team, who among the Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal gives a chance in the playing XI
 jeet ke liye taras rahi he windidoosri taraf westeindies kii team pichley kuch samay se vanade main puri tarah se flop rahi he

 What is happening in the Aam Aadmi Party? kya ye party bhi baaki partiyon jaisi ho gai he
 This has become the most asked question for the last one week
 aam aadmi party ke samarthak, voter to puch hi rahe hai, duusare dal ke netaa or samarthakon kii bhi dilchaspee bani hui he
 This question gives great hope to the internal democracy of the parties
 chunaavon ke bich-bich main aise sawaal mukhar hote rahane chahie
 The kitchen of democracy is not only made in the government, within the parties and also in the houses
 is puure vivaad kaa ek sakaaratmak hasil yahi he ki log puch rahe hai ki aam aadmi party main kya ho rahaa he
 It cannot claim that this is happening for the first time but after a long time, it is getting heard
 arvind kejariwal sahi hai yaa yogendra yadav is khemebaazi se nikal kar party kaise chalati he kaa sawaal phir se nayaa nayaa sa ho gaya he
 Do you know when a party's parliamentary board becomes stronger than the national executive and when the national executive becomes a paper body in front of a strong president
 kya aapako pataa he ki congress kii kaarysmiti main sadsy manonit hi kyon hote hai
 Why don't they come by choosing? kya aapako pataa he ki bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini apane samay par hoti he yaa nahin
 What happens is the process of keeping things in it
 kaise koi saamaanya kaaryakarta in prakriyaaon kaa laabh uthaate hue adhyaksh yaa netaa kii marzi ke bagair party ke sheersh padon tak pahunch saktaa he
 Have our political parties started acting like closed doors? is sawaal kaa jawaab to ham dashakon se jaanate hai ki partiyaan bade netaa kii jebi sanghathan main tabdeel ho gai hai
 Often we see these questions through the spectacles of the battle for supremacy
 party main do tarah kii raay ho sakati he ise sweekaar karne kii bajaay ham netaa se adaavat kii tarah pesh karne lagate hai
 Leaders also give evidence of their strength or hold by expelling or marginalizing such people
 sansadeey dal yaa vidhayak dalon kii baithken muhar lagane se zyada kisi kaam kii nahin rah gayi hai
 The diversity of ideas has been exhausted in such meetings
 partiyon main sansthaaen varchasv kii ladaai kaa hathiyaar ban kar rah gai hai
 Two years before this controversy of the Aam Aadmi Party, there was a lot of discussion of such organizations of BJP when Narendra Modi was claiming his position for the post of Prime Minister
 rozaana khabaren aa rahi thim ki unhen sansadeey dal kaa sadsy banaaya jayega yaa nahin
 It was sometimes reported that he would be given charge of the election campaign committee
 agar abhiyaan samiti ke adhyaksh ke naate modi bahumat le bhi aate hai to bhi pradhanmantri koun hoga iskaa faisla sansadeey board karegaa
 Institutions within the party are awakened to run the gamut in leadership battles, we do not pay attention to how they work in the rest of the time
 isliye zaruri he ki varchasv kii ladaai ke alaava ham ise is rup main bhi dekhen ki alag-alag raayon ko kitni jagah mil rahi he
 The party will have one opinion, but if two or three opinions emerge before that one opinion is formed, which mountain will break
 zaruri he ki ham saamaanya dinon main bhi aantarik sansthaaon kii karypranali ko mahatv den
 Transparency of these institutions should be important for any party worker
 tikat bantwaare ke samay kitne dalon main marpet kii naubat aa jaati he
 Rumors started spreading that if Falan took the ticket by paying money, Falan distributed the ticket with the money
 kai baar ye afvaahen sach bhi hoti hai
 After all, the public should know what procedures were debated and the resolution passed before reaching any policy or decision
 67 siton kii aitihaasik jeet ke baad bhi aam aadmi party kii vishwasaneeyata kaa moolyankan uske aantarik loktantr ke aadhaar par ho rahaa he
 a lot of articles are being written in the Opposition on whether the Aam Aadmi Party has stood on this scale or not
 party ke sadsy or samarthak hi puch rahe hai ki hamaari party main asahmati kii jagah nahin hogi to ye baaki dalon se kaise alag he
 People of other parties were also seeing whether there is any place of disagreement in this new party apart from their party
 polytical afares cameti kii baithak asahmati ke sammaan main hui yaa anushaasanamak karrwai ke liye, is par bhi bahes chal rahi he
 It is a big deal for eight people to vote in favor of Yogendra Yadav or get a pre-decided decision
 chunaav ke turant baad jab sara dhyaan is par hota he ki sarkaar kaise chalati he, yah poocha jane laga ki party kaise chalati he, kisi ke ishaare par chalati he yaa kisi ko chalane ke liye ishaara karti he
 These questions of interest in the internal institutions of the parties are like fresh air
 is vivaad ne yahi kaam kiya he
 a friend of ours Pankaj Jha said that it is interesting that AAP supporters did not take the leader's line
 bahuton ne yogendra kaa bhi saath diya
 All the volunteers of mango separated themselves from this battle of supremacy and joined with the question of the party's institutions
 bijepi ke interneti samarthak bhakt ke naam se mashhoor ho chuke hai
 His image has become such that his job is to justify every decision
 aam aadmi party ke samarthakon kii interneti bhashaa kuch waisi hi banati gai he
 They are also said to be offensive, that means if they question the Aam Aadmi Party, they will use abusive language
 lekin is vivaad se nai baat yah hui ki party ke samarthak or shubhachintakon ne bhi party kii bhakthi chhod di
 These are new types of supporters
 inkaa raajnneeti main vishesh rup se swaagat hona chahie
 They are not blind devotees
 arvind kejariwal ke fasebuk pej par aae coment dekh rahaa tha
 While many had appealed to remain single, many criticized their steps
 kuch ne baghawat ke swar main antim faisla suna diya tha to kai party ke samarthak bane rahete hue bhi apane str par aalochana ko swar de rahe the
 Political parties are going through a crisis
 kai baar in sankaton kaa samaadhaan majboot netaa ko aage kar taal diya jaataa he
 But those leaders also have to return to internal institutions who feel that the party is their legacy
 unke bina party kuch nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi, who talks about internal elections in Congress, has also made a lot of fun, but he also knows that this is the only way to make politics lively
 yah mushkil rasta zarur he kyonki isse vaise netritv ke ubharne kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa he jisase paaramparik yaa sthapit netritv ko hi chunauti mil sakati he
 So this question is not so easy but it is good that whichever party you are a supporter or activist, keep asking questions about how our party runs
 hamaari party main kya ho rahaa he
 Jarnail Singh, MLA from Aam Aadmi Party's Rajouri Garden in Delhi, has resigned from the assembly
 vah ab punjab kii raajnneeti main sakriy hai or vahaan kii lambi vidhansabha se ummidavaar hai

" ‚Äô The NCP and Shiv Sena are now agreeing on a 50-50 formula to bring back Ajit Pawar, who was deputy CM in the new government formed with the BJP
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki donon partiyaan dhai-dhai saal sarkaar chalaane ke liye raji ho gai hai
 Earlier, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal also visited Ajit Pawar's house to convince him
 gauratlab he ki shivasena netaa sanjay raut beete do dinon se ummid jataa rahe the ki ajit pavaar waapas aa jaaenge
 Sanjay Raut was also claiming that Ajit Pawar has been blackmailed
 aapako bataa den ki ensipi ke vidhayakon ko mumbai ke hotel main rensaan hotel main rakhaa gaya he lekin ab unhen mumbai airport ke najadik hayaat hotel main shift kiya jayega
 Sources say that they are being brought here because no one here will be able to 'disturb' them
 vahiin lalit hotel main shivasena or mariot main congress ke vidhayakon ko tikaaya gaya he
 The NCP says it has 50 mlas
 baaki bache chaar bhi mumbai aa rahe hai
 The BJP claims that it has the support of all 54 NCP mlas

 These mlas will prove to be crucial in getting the figure of 145 mlas required for a majority in a house of 288 members
 congress or ensipi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar baatcheet kar rahi shivasena kaa daawa he ki apane 56 vidhayakon ke alaava use saat vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 BJP, the largest party with 105 mlas in the state, claims that it has the support of 14 other mlas
 haalanki abhi yah spasht nahin he ki kitne vidhayak ajit pavaar ke saath hai
 But if Ajit Pawar returns on the 50-50 formula, then again congress-ncp and Shiv Sena will form a government easily
 bijepi gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav jald karaane ke paksh main he
 Discussions have begun between the top leaders of the BJP and the RSS for conducting the elections ahead of time
 vaise tay samay ke mutabik rajya main chunaav disambar 2017 tak honi he, lekin bijepi ke sthaneey netaa ise kam se kam chah maheene pehle karnaa chaahate hai
 According to the Ahmedabad Mirror newspaper, BJP leaders believe that the party can benefit from holding elections soon
 yahi nahin bijepi kaa ek dhada to yah bhi maan rahaa he ki iske pehle amul badlaav karnaa hoga or mukhyamantri ummidavaar kisi or netaa ko ghoshit karnaa hoga
 He believes that Vijay Rupani is not the leader to lead in the crucial 2017 election
 in netaaon kaa maananaa he ki rajya main aam aadmi party or congress kii chunauti se nipatna he to kisi obisi candidet ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karnaa chahie
 About 45 percent of the voters in the state come from the OBC category
 inamen 32
 5 percent of the voters live in rural areas
 agar bijepi ne koi obisi cheharaa saamne aayaa to isse congress or aap kaa sameekaran bighad saktaa he
 This can also prove to be a cut-off for the Patidars, who are demanding reservation
 lekin sawaal yah bhi he ki ek saal ke bheetar kya janata bijepi ke tisare mukhyamantri chehre ko sweekaar karegi? isliye ek dhada is vichaar ke khilaaf bhi he, uskaa maananaa he ki rupani ko abhi chah maheene bhi nahin hue hai, aise main kisi or ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 In place of Rupani, some people are also raising the name of senior leader Shankar Chaudhary, but any new face can also be brought forward
 abhi hai paristhitiyaan anukulgauratlab he ki gujarat main saal 2002 se hi bijepi lagaataar behatar pradarshan kar rahi he
 BJP currently holds 123 of the 182 seats in the state assembly
 vaise aresas ke netaaon kii maane to bijepi or aresas rajya main jaldi chunaav karaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 If elections are held with UP and Punjab, then they are also ready for this
 in netaaon kaa maananaa he ki notebandi se janata main koi nakaaratmak lahar nahin he, kyonki zyaadaatar log yahi maan rahe hai ki narendra modi kaa yah kadam kaale dhan or aatankwaad par ankush lagane ke liye jaruri he
 Presently, the court has banned the entry of Patel leader Hardik in Gujarat
 is saal barish or fasal acchhee hui he, jiskaa abhi bijepi ko phayda mil saktaa he
 This situation may not happen next year
 isi tarah agar punjab or goa main aam aadmi party behatar pradarshan karti he, to gujarat main uski chunauti bad sakati he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Gujarat four times in the last two months, it is also considered a sign of early elections

 Vivo ne kuch samay pehle bhartiya bazaar main ek nae smartphone Vivo V15 Pro launch kiya tha
 It is currently being sold in the market
 company ne isaki keemat 28,990 rupee rakhi he or isaki sabase badi khubi yah he ki isamen pop-ap selfi camera diya gaya he
 This pop-up selfie camera was first given by the company among the expensive smartphones under the NEX brand
 haalanki ab company ne ise menstream kiya or mid range smartphone main is feechar ko diya he
 It would not be wrong to say that Vivo is one step ahead of other companies in offering unique features in smartphones
 hamane is smartphone ko kaaphi lambey samay tak yuj kiya he or ab ham aapako iskaa rivyuu dene ja rahe hai
 Design, Display and Look Vivo's new V15 Pro looks similar to the rest of the company's smartphones
 lekin antar ye he ki isamen koi noch najar nahin aayega kyonki phul screen dene ke liye hi yahaan pop-ap selfi camera diya gaya he
 Triple cameras are available in the back
 micro esady card ke liye yahaan alag se trey diya gaya he
 The speaker grill is placed in the bottom
 yahaan headphone jaik bhi maujuud he, jisaki jagah top main rakhi gai he
 The micro USB port is provided for charging in the bottom itself
 hamen ummid thi ki yahaan tip-c port diya janaa chahie tha
 Power buttons and volume rockers are placed in the right side of the device
 yuj main isamen dikkat nahin aati he
 The special thing is that if you use too much virtual assistant, then you will get a separately dedicated button on the right side here
 luk kii baat karen to tach karne se aapako ye premium feel detaa he
 The back has a gradient look with dual tone color here
 lekin ye gradient luk aajkal bajet smartfones main bhi kaaman he, aise main iske luk ko thodaa or behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 Similarly, when talking about display, here 91
 6% screen tu body reshyo ke saath 6
 The 39-inch full-hd (1080x2340 pixels) Super AMOLED display is given and as we mentioned above, there is no notch in it
 disple kaaphi brit he or tach bhi kaaphi smood he
 Colors' temperature is also very good
 aap ise sanlite main aasaani se upyog kar sakate hai
 Performance Talking about the performance of Vivo V15 Pro, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor with 6GB of RAM
 ye procesar philhal bazaar ke liye nayaa hi he
 Right now it has been given only in select smartphones
 naam ke liye Redmi Note 7 Pro ko gina ja saktaa he
 Now the question is that Note 7 Pro is a budget smartphone and this smartphone of Vivo is about 29,000 rupees, why the same processor? So the answer is that you will also get many features in this phone which justifies its price
 rahaa sawaal speed or phone ke lag hone kaa to aapako yahaan eps switch karte hue yaa dheron function oparate karte hue koi lag mahasoos nahin hoga
 There is no problem of getting hot here
 ek dikkat jo mahasoos hui wo ye thi ki bydaree lo hone par ye phone hang karne lagata he
 However, despite all this, i cannot call it the perfect processor for this smartphone
 baaki game bhi aap kaaphi smudi khel sakate hai or yahaan gaming ke liye khaastaur par ek game kyub kaa opshan bhi aapako settings main mil jayega
 Its internal memory is 128GB
 jo teen camere vaale smartphone se zyada photo clic karne ke liye paryaapt he
 You can also use a memory card as well
 software parformens kii baat karen to vivo ke is smartphone main android 9 pai besd funtouch OS 9 UI diya gaya he
 Which cannot be said much better or unique than smartphones like Samsung, but better than earlier smartphones
 yahaan custom UI main koi aids nahin milte
 Remember there is no support for Widevine L1, so you have to watch the content of Netflix in low resolution only
 yahaan software main zyada blots nahin hai
 Some companies have their own apps which you cannot delete even though their number is small
 aapako settings main games se lekar home screen main edjastment tak or bike mod se lekar smart clic tak dheron function milenge
 Also, by swiping left to right on the home screen, you can also place shortcuts for many functions
 iske alaava in-disple fingerprint sensor kii baat karen to ye bhi kaaphi fast he or pop-ap camere se phase-analock karnaa chahen to ye bhi kaaphi fast he
 The thing about your work is that here 3
 5mm headphone jaik diya gaya he
 Camera The most highlighted feature is its camera in this smartphone
 ham ise behtareen selfi or achche rier camere ki liye dusron se do kadam aage kah sakate hai
 Talking about the specifications, three cameras have been given in the rear
 yahaan f / 2
 8MP wide-angle sensor with 2 aperture, f / 2
 4 aparchar ke saath 5MP defth sensor or f / 1
 a 48MP quad pixel sensor with 8 aperture has been given
 dhyaan rahe ye vastav main 48 megapixl camera nahin he ye 12 megapixl sensor he jo four-in-van technology kaa upyog karata he
 Here you will find many such features including filters, which you also find in other smartphones
 sidhe photography quality par baat karte hai
 You will get photos with Bright and Perfect Colors during the day
 lo-lite photography ke liye yahaan nite mod diya gaya he jo behtareen kaam karata he
 However, you will not be able to use it in a 48 megapixel camera or in wide-angle mode
 ab baat karen to wide angel mod kii to ye camera bade kaam he or aapke smartphone photography main chaar chand lagaataa he
 However, clicking photos in the night in this mode does not give the dealings in the photos and there is a lot of noise in the shots
 ab baat karte hai boke mod yani defth sencing kii to yahaan camera tab zyada behatar image detaa he jab forground or becoground main kaaphi antar ho
 If the subjects are very close, then you will not get blur background sharp in Aegis
 is mod main lo-lite photography tri karenge to thodi softness najar aegi
 We believe that this will be the effect of the software itself
 iske alaava pro mod main bhi aap haath aajamaa sakate hai or kai tarah ke beauty mod, AR stikers or kai filters kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Apart from all this, focusing is very fast, in which you will not face any particular problem and the scene detection feature is also better
 ab baat karte hai duniya ke pehle 32MP pop-ap selfi camere kii to ye kaaphi gajab kii selfi letaa he
 That means selfie lovers will like it a lot
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den jo aam selfi ke filters milte hai wo yahaan hai hi iske alaava ye camera by difolt brit selfi letaa he
 However you can make settings for this and find True Tone
 saath hi colors bhi ektual hi lagate hai
 That is, if you want a selfie for social media, then it is very good
 kaaphi diteling bhi aapako milti he or focusing ko lekar bhi koi samasya nahin aati
 The best part is that its pop-up mechanism does not bother you with software or hardware in any way and works quite fast
 photo sample(image web ke liye risise kii gayi hai)bydariakhri factor isaki bydaree he, iske bare main baat karen to isamen 3700mah kii bydaree di gai he jo phone ko ek din to normal yuj main chal jaati he
 In such a situation, for a better performance, it would have been good for a price of Rs 28,990 if the battery was given a bit more
 iske alaava fast charging itani bhi fast nahin he lekin aap pareshaan nahin hoga
 You will charge the phone up to 70 percent in about 1 hour
 faislab sawaal ye he ki kya aapako ye smartphone khareednaa chahie? to jawaab ye he ki is smartphone keemat main behtareen procesar, bydaree or ram ke saath smartfones aapako bazaar main milenge, lekin pop-ap selfi camera jaisaa unic feechar, behtareen noch-les disple, behtareen camera or thik-thaak bydaree isaki aisi khubiyaan hai, jiske liye isamen paisa lagaana bura sabit nahin hoga
 It would have been better if only the price had been kept slightly lower
 selfi lovers ke liye jaahir taur par ye smartphone behtareen he
 We hope that the pop-up selfie camera will be given in budget smartphones in the coming days

 The Adelaide pitch did not show the same pace and bounce as was being discussed before the match

 But the opener could not survive in the process of playing the shot

 Tsonga's family also came to Mayank's village from South Korea on this occasion and attended the whole ceremony
 is rishte se na keval songa or mayank khush hai balki donon ke parijan bhi kaaphi khush hai
 Mayank's father Madhav Sharan Tiwari said that Indian culture believes in 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', so the bonding of caste and country cannot dominate relationships
 ve kehete hai ki unke liye unke putr kii khushi sarvopari he
 At the same time, Mayank says that Kayla Tsonga of Indian culture proposed marriage to her in 2008, but some days the marriage was delayed due to studies and some days due to lack of consensus in the family
 mayank padhai ke liye 2006 main dakshin korea gaye the or songa se unki mulaakaat hui thi
 After this, the two developed a deep friendship and then this friendship gradually turned into love
 mayank bataate hai ki songa bihar main 2007 main us samay betia ai thi, jab yahaan baadh kaa prakope tha
 Then Mayank felt that Tsonga would never come to Bihar again after seeing the situation here
 parantu bhartiya samskruti ko pasand karne vaali songa ek saal baad phir bihar ai
 After this he proposed marriage to Mayank
 apni sabhyataa or samskruti par vishwaas karne vaale mayank kehete hai ki unako apane parijanon ke saamne songa se vivaah karne kaa prastaav rakhane main do varsh lag gaye the
 However, the two families consented to the marriage and both were married at a private hotel in Bettiah on Monday

 Following the defeat in the Gaul Test, Binny was called to Colombo quickly, and team director Ravi Shastri continued to bowl to him during the practice session

 Virat Kohli wants all the members of the team to contribute to the batting, so that he can continue his strategy of five bowlers

 That day he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi
 garmjoshi bhari is mulaakaat main bharat or pakistan ke bich rishte sudhaarney kii patibaddhta doharaai gai
 Then Imran Khan was on a tour to India as a former cricketer and Pakistani MP
 imran khan ne modi ko pakistan aane kaa nyotaa diya or tab mulaakaat kii ye tasviir kaaphi charchaa main rahi thi
 Today different circumstances, different stage Today, after 42 months, the situation is different, the conditions of the two leaders are different and now the stage is also different
 ab imran khan pakistan ke pradhanmantri hai, balakot airstrike ke baad narendra modi duusari baar chunaav jitkar, or bhi majboot hokar ubhare hai
 The two leaders will meet face to face in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan on 13‚Äì14 June
 mauka hoga shanghai sahyog sanghathan yani SCO sammelan kaa
 This would be the first time that the two leaders would arrive together on an international stage
 kaise pighalegi rishton main jami barf?aaj donon deshon ke rishte haal ke dinon main sabase talkh hai, rishton main barf jami hui he or pakistan kii jameen par pal rahaa aatankwaad rishton main sudhaar kii kisi bhi koshish kii raah main baadha bana hua he
 How many wounds of Pakistan, terrorists like Mumbai, Uri, Pathankot and Pulwama have been given to India and Pakistan is seen doing nothing more than showing up in the name of dictate action
 aise main bharat saaf kar chukaa he ki aatankwaad ruke bina pakistan se ab koi baatcheet nahin hogi
 Before modi-imran left for Kyrgyzstan, the government of Pakistan and Imran Khan themselves have tried three times in two weeks to allow India to accept the negotiation offer
 lekin ab bharat pakistan ke dohare charitra par bharosa karata hua nahin dikhataa
 Denying any plans to meet imran-modi, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Ravish Kumar clearly said - "as far as i know, there is no plan for a bilateral meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan at the SCO conference in Bishkek
 'pathankot hamale ke vakt se vaarta patari se utrijanvari 2016 main pathankot airbase par hue aatanki hamale ke baad se donon deshon ke bich vaarta band he
 After this Uri attack, India made surgical strike and made the world realize the new policy
 jab bhartiya sainikon ne pioke main ghuskar aatanki thikaanon ko tabah kiya
 Then on 14 February 2019, a terrorist attack took place in Pulwama this year
 jiske jawaab main bharat ne balakot main airstrike kar pakistan ko sidhaa sabak sikhaaya
 Both countries were on the verge of war
 lekin wing commander abhinandan ko turant reeha kar pakistan bharat kii sidhi karrwai ko philhal taalane main safal rahaa
 But India has now made an open declaration that if terror attacks occur, action will be taken against the terrorist bases of Pakistan
 bharat kii taraf se spasht kaha ja chukaa he ki pakistan ke apni dharti par maujuud aatankiyon par karrwai karne se pehle vah vaarta kii mej par nahin aayega
 How solid is Pakistan's action against terrorists? Even after the Pulwama terror attack, Pakistan showed the same action as it had done during the 2008 Mumbai attacks
 lekin aatank ke madrason par talbandi or kuch aatankiyon kii najarbandi se aage vah ja nahin sakaa
 Therefore, India destroyed the terrorist bases of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot by airstrike
 saath hi yuan main america-france or britain ke sahyog se bharat aatanki masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit karaane main safal rahaa
 While China was busy trying to make friendship with Pakistan
 hafiz said kii najarbandi or haal main id par uski khuli takreer par roak lagaakar pakistan ne bharat ko aatank ke khilaaf ection kaa sandesh dene kii pichley hafte koshish jarur kii he taaki baatcheet ke liye bharat taiyaar ho jaae lekin itane se bharat ke baatcheet kii teble par lautne kii gunjaaish kam hi he
 Pakistan, which is going through three financial crisis in two weeks, is pleading on international forums for debt
 efeetief se bain kaa khatra alag se us par bana hua he
 Even for the first time Pakistan has announced to reduce its defense budget
 iske alaava bharat se baar-baar baatcheet shuru karne ke liye bhi vah gidgidaa rahaa he
 - On 26 May, Pakistan PM Imran Khan called PM Modi to congratulate him on the victory, and urged talks
 - pakistan kii taraf se essio sammelan main donon sheersh netaaon kii baatcheet ke die gaye sanket- bharat ne kaha- essio sammelan ke dauraan piem modi kii paak piem se vaarta kii koi yojana nahin he- 4 june ko paak videsh sachiv shah mahmud bharat pahunche, isse donon piem kii mulaakaat kii atakalein lageen- 6 june ko pakistani videsh mantri ne es jaishankar ko chitthee likh vaarta kii phir guhaar lagaai- bharat ne phir se kaha- aatank ke khatme se pehle pakistan ke saath koi baatcheet nahin hogi- 7 june ko imran khan ne piem modi ko chitthee likh phir baatcheet kii guhaar lagaai
 In his letter, Imran Khan congratulated PM Modi on coming back to power
 imran ne dilli or islamabad ke bich baatcheet kii peshkash karte hue sabhi jaruri masalon samet kashmir ke mudde ko hal karne kii baat kahi
 Imran Khan further wrote - 'dialogue between the two countries is the only way to remove the poverty of the people of both countries
 kshetreey vikaas ke liye milakar kaam karnaa kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Pakistan wants to find a solution to all the problems, including the Kashmir issue
 'imran ko shapath main nahin bulaakar diya jhatka2014 main shapath grahan main piem modi ne pakistani piem navaj sharif ko nyotaa diya tha
 Later, after reaching Pakistan suddenly, PM Modi gave everyone a chance to make peace efforts
 lekin pakistan kii ore se aatanki hamalon ke sivaa kuch nahin mila
 After this, when PM Modi was sworn in for the second innings on 30 May 2019, PM Modi gave a strong message to improve the relations with neighboring countries by calling BIMSTEC member countries and not calling Imran
 duusari baar satta sanbhaalane ke baad piem modi sabase pehle padosi desh maldive or phir srilanka gaye
 Thereafter at the SCO meeting

 But the possibility of any meeting with Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been rejected by India

 India got membership in SCO in 2017, during this time Pakistan also got membership in this organization
 bharat ke liye essio asia or soviet kshetron main teji se ubharate deshon ke saath sahyog badhaane kaa ek manch he to pakistan ko uske saathi china kii maujuudagi main bhav nahin dekar aatankwaad par kadaa sandesh dene ke liye bhi ek acha kootnithik avasar
