 The Iraqi government said the terrorist organization ISIS has been eliminated from Mosul
 jeet kii khushi main iraqi sena ne mosul main apana jhanda faharaya
 Mosul got freedom from ISIS terrorists
 magar jin bharatiyon ko ISIS aatankiyon ne bandhan banaaya tha, unki philhal koi khabar nahin he
 Following ISIS occupation of Mosul, June 2014 there were reports of 39 Indian laborers being tied up
 is bich harjit singh ISIS ke changul se nikalne main safal rahaa
 After coming to India, Harjit Christ claimed that all 39 Indian laborers have been shot and killed
 videsh mantralay ne kiya jivit hone kaa daawaabhale hi harjit singh ne bandhak bhartiya mazdooron kii maut kii baat kahi ho, magar videsh mantralay lagaataar unke jivit hone kaa daawa karata rahaa he
 Recently the Ministry of External Affairs had said that all the Indians held hostage are safe, they have not suffered any harm
 videsh mantralay ne ye bhi bataaya tha bandhakon kii rihaai ke evaj main koi demand nahin kii gai he
 Earlier in Parliament, Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh had reported the safety of all hostage Indians
 unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar bandhakon kii surakshit rihaai ke liye sabhi kadam uthaa rahi he
 VK Singh will go to Iraq
 Meanwhile, the Ministry of External Affairs said that VK Singh will go to Irbil
 videsh mantralay ne ISIS se mosul kii aazaadee par khushi jataai or aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main jeet kaa swaagat kiya
 The ministry also said that with the victory of the Iraqi army over Mosul, the Indian government has begun every possible effort to search for 39 hostage Indians
 mosul se ISIS kaa 'clin sweep', iraqi sena ne fahraaya jhandiraqi piem ne nahin diya koi bayanhaalanki, ravivaar ko iraq ke pradhanmantri haidar al-abdi mosul pahunche or jeet ke liye sena ko badhai di
 But during this period, Abdi did not address the country on victory
 na hi iraq sarkaar or sena kii taraf bhartiya bandhakon ke sambandh main koi jaankaree di gai
 In such a big question, when the terrorists have been wiped out from Mosul and 39 Indian laborers were in the clutches of ISIS terrorists, then where are the Indian laborers? nobel puraskaar se sammanit arthshaastri amartya sen ne kaha he ki modi sarkaar ke dauraan academik maamalon main sarkari dakhsandaji 'asaadhaaran rup se aam cheez' or aksar 'raajnneetik rup se atyadhik' ho gai he

 ) purv bijepi adhyaksh or kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh in dinon pareshaan hai
 The reason for his concern is the media report regarding his son Pankaj Singh
 rajnath singh kaa kahana he ki unke bete ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh ho rahi he
 a conspiracy is being hatched against him
 aaj tak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik grahamantri rajnath singh ne sangh ke varisht adhikariyon or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se shikaayat kii he
 Rajnath Singh has said that rumors are being spread about him and his son Pankaj Singh, which are totally wrong
 unhen rokane kii jarurat he
 He has expressed doubts that a conspiracy is being hatched against the question of who is the number 2 in Modi government
 aapako bataa den ki pichley 30-40 dinon se dilli ke raajnneetik galiyare main yah charchaa garm rahi he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pankaj singh ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai thi
 It happened that Modi called Rajnath Singh and Pankaj Singh in his office and asked what was going on
 is dauraan pankaj ne apane kaamkaaj kaa byoraa piem ko diya
 In the end, the PM asked Pankaj Singh to return the money you had taken from a police officer for transfer
 haalanki is khabar ki na to kabhi pushti hui or na hi khandan
 Now Rajnath Singh is fed up
 unhone shikaayat darj karai he ki juthi kahaniyaan failaai ja rahi hai jisase unhen thes pahunchi he
 He said that Modi never called him and Pankaj
 naa unke bete ne ghoose liya or naa hi piem ne koi fatkaar lagaai
 This is the first time Rajnath Singh has openly denied this news
 kai netaaon ne party ke aantarik matbhed ko ishaara kiya he
 Now it has to be seen how Narendra Modi and Amit Shah deal with this problem
 pankaj ke khilaaf ai media reporongreji akhbaar hindustan times ne daawa kiya ki kharaab aacharan ke kaaran piem modi pankaj singh ko upachunaav kaa tikat nahin dena chaahate the
 Rajnath is unable to launch Pankaj Singh, in the BJP, leaders like Kalyan Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Prem Kumar Dhumil have launched their son in electoral politics
 lekin rajnath singh is maamle main pichad gaye
 Pankaj Singh has not even contested the election even once
 13 sitambar ko hone vaale uttar pradesh vidhansabha upachunaav main noida seat se pankaj singh kii daavedaari sabase majboot maani ja rahi thi
 But the party announced to give ticket to Vimala Batham on this seat
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhi rajnath ke gajiabad seat khaali karne par pankaj singh ko tikat die jane kii sambhaavna jataai jane lagi, par aisa nahin hua
 In the 2012 UP Assembly elections, Pankaj Singh got a ticket from a seat in the Banaras region
 haalanki baari virodh ke baad unhone khud hi tikat waapas kar diya
 The caravan of Pankaj Singh's protest was not limited to just an election ticket
 jab unhen bhartiya janata yuva morcha kaa pradesh adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya to us vakt bhi iskaa joardaar virodh hua
 In the end, he had to lose his position
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaha he ki unki sarkaar kii koshish hogi ki 2016 ke ant tak lakhanu metro chalane lage
 He said these things on the occasion of Bhoomi Poojan of the Metro Rail Project
 akhilesh ne yaad dilaayaa ki lakhanu metro pariyojna kii shuruyaat ke maukey par netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) ne kaha tha ki yah pariyojna agle vidhansabha chunaav tak puri ho jaani chahie
 Also, the UP CM assured that the work of agra-lucknow Expressway is going ahead
 akhilesh yadav ne daawa kiya he ki pradesh kii samaajawaadee party sarkaar ne rajya ke vikaas ke liye aisi bahut-si pariyojnaon par kaam kiya he, jinke bare main anya rajyon ke paas koi najariya tak nahin he
 Akhilesh, while addressing the Bhoomi Poojan ceremony of Lucknow Metro Rail Project, said, 'since coming to power, the SP government has done a lot of things that other state governments cannot even imagine
 ' unhone apni sarkaar ke kaamon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, 'hamane laptop baante, kanya vidyadhan diya or ab samaajawaadee pension yojana shuru kii he, jo apni tarah kii sabase bady pension yojana he

 film 'masaan' to release ho chuki he magar uttar pradesh sarkaar ne 'jannisar' ko release hone se pehle hi kar mukt karne kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 The thing to note is that the film 'masaan' had already received appreciation and 2 awards at the Cannes Film Festival
 uske baad film bharat main pradarshit hui or koob vaahvahee bator rahi he
 The comments is film ne desh ke kai muddon ko sachai se ujagar kiya he jisamen choti or badi zaati ke bhedbhaav or pulisia system kii dadagiri shaamil he
 It is obvious that this film was considered close to reality and that is probably the reason why this film has been tax free
 vahiin duusari taraf film 'jannisar' agle hafte release hogi lekin release se pehle hi ise uttar pradesh main kar mukt kar diya gaya
 From this film, the director of 'umrao Jaan' Muzaffar Ali is making a comeback, and the story of the film is pre-independence which will show the story of many freedom fighters who went anonymous
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki film 'masaan' ko pehle hi kaan film samaaroh main saraahna or 2 puruskaar mil chuke the
 After that the film was released in India and is receiving great accolades
 tippaniyan The film has truthfully exposed many issues in the country, including discrimination of small and big races and grandeur of the police system
 zaahir he ye film reality ke qareeb maani ja rahi thi or shaayad yahi vajah he ki is film ko tex free kiya gaya he

 New Zealand recovered from a poor start after winning the toss with a 48-run partnership for the fourth wicket between captain Ross Taylor (95) and Scott Styris (89)
 5 over main 288 ran banaaye lekin derel tuffey kii aguwai vaale kiwi akraman ke saamne bharatiyon ke liye yah lakshya jald hi everest se bhi bada ho gaya or aakhir main puri bhartiya team 29
 Stacked for 88 runs in 3 overs
 yah van de main 24waan avasar he jabaki bhartiya team 100 ran tak bhi nahin pahunch paayi
 This is the most difficult defeat for New Zealand at the hands of her, while for the fourth time she was defeated by 200 or more runs
 bharat kii taraf se teen ballebaaj dohare ank main pahunche jisamen ravinder jadeja ne sarvaadhik 20 ran banaaye jabaki newjiland kii taraf se deral tuffey ne teen tathaa kyle mills or jaikab oram ne do-do wicket liye
 At no point in the match did it feel that it is the second-ranked team in the world and it recently won the Asia Cup at this ground
 newjiland ke tej gendbaajon kii short pich gend kaa bhartiya ballebaajon ke paas koi jawaab nahin diya jinamein se adhiktar ne slip kshetra main kaich thamaye
 Suresh Raina (6), who recently made a debut in the Test matches in Sri Lanka, opened the account with fours but he also returned to the pavilion after catching a catch at slip off Tuffy's short length ball
 ab captain mahendra singh dhoni (2) kii baari thi jinhone bematlab kaa ran churaane ke prayaas main apana wicket ganvaaya
 Yuvraj Singh (5), who made a comeback to the Indian One Day team, played 25 balls but in the meantime he looked uncomfortable and finally caught a very easy catch in the slip off Andy mckay's full length ball
 praveen kumaar bhi slip par kaich dene vaale chauthe ballebaaj bane
 This time the bowler was Oram, whose short length ball Praveen did not like
 abhimanyu mithun (4) ne kuch sangharsh kiya lekin unhone bhi oram kii gend par slip main kaich thamaya
 Jadeja remained at the crease for 44 balls but eventually Kane Williamson made him the first victim of his career while the dismissal of Ashish Nehra ended the tragic tale of the Indian innings
 bharat ko pehali safalataa praveen ne pari ke tisare over main hi martin guptil (11) ko dhoni ke haathon kaich karakar dilaayi
 Nehra showed off the pavilion to Peter Ingram (12) in the sixth over, while Praveen hoisted off the stumps of Williamson (0), playing his first match, off the ball moving from the middle stump
 tailor or styris ne yaheen se pari sanvaarane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Taylor was batting with confidence from the start but it took a while for Styris to get a foothold
 unke khilaaf elbeadblyoo kii kuch vishwasaneey apilen bhi hui jabaki dhoni ne unhen jeevandaan bhi diya
 When Styris was on 16, Dhoni missed an easy chance to stump him out off Ojha
 jab lag rahaa tha ki donon ballebaaj shatak puraa karne main safal rahenge tab ojha ne styris ko bold karke yah saajhedaari todi
 Styris scored a six off Ojha's first ball of this over but his balls were shattered in an attempt to play the third ball at the cross
 styris ne 95 gend kheli tathaa nau chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 Oram (14) hit two fours in an over from Jadeja but Nehra lbw him and Taylor to stop New Zealand's progress

 ranvir goron kii hinsa kaa jawaab hinsa se detaa he lekin pagadi naa utaarne ke kaaran america police se barkhaast hua fateh singh use kanoonee ladaai ladane kii salaah detaa he
 All the characters calmly try to convince the Americans that the turban is a symbol of the courage and devotion of the Sikhs to honor it
 It is a good thing but how many times the same thing and similar dialogues will be repeated in a film
 kai karactors kii dialog delivery badi immeor he jiske chalate vakil or epabi agent kii buddhi par bhi shaq hota
 Like the old films, Indians and Pakistanis reach America and become deep friends
 america vakil pehali duusari mulaakaat main hi apane indian client se zyada garmjoshi dikhaane lagati he
 There are many dialogues in English which do not even have a subtitled Hindi

 Pleased with his sake, the Queen gives him a 'scribe' from the chef
 vah maharani ko hindustani bhashaa bhi sikhaata he
 He also consults with him on matters related to India

 dhokhadhadi ke aropmen fansi unitech ko supreme court ne badi raahat di he
 The Supreme Court has stayed the decision of the National Company Law Tribunal in which it asked the government to take over the management of the company
 isi dauraan ensielti ke faisle ko lekar centre sarkaar ne bhi nakhushi jataai
 The Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the government, said that NCLT should not have issued any such order
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar kabhi bhi ensielti se aisa faisla dene kii apil nahin karti
 Last week on Friday, NCLT had asked the Central Government to appoint 10 directors to run the management of the company
 is faisle ke saath hi ensielti ne is maamle ko agali sunwaayee ke liye 20 disambar tak taal diya tha
 However, now the Supreme Court has stayed it

 england ke khilaaf khele gaye tii-20 siries ke duusare match main team india ko 5 wicket se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The series of three T20 matches has gone 1‚Äì1
 bataa den ki siries ke pehle match main team india ne england ko 8 wicket se patkhni di thi
 In the second T20 match played at the Sofia Gardens ground in Cardiff, Team India had a great chance to create history in England
 lekin ballebaajon ke kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran team india ko ab iske liye ravivaar tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 Team India's debut in the dream of winning the first T20 series in England was not good
 england ne toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji kaa faisla liya
 The bowlers upheld the Indian team's 3 wickets on the score of 22 runs, proving their captain's decision correct
 pehle match main acchhee ballebaaji karne vaale rohit sharma or shatakaveer lokesh rahul is match main puri tarah flop rahe
 Rohit became the victim of the ball playing his first T20 match at the score of 5 runs
 vahiin lokesh rahul ko 6 ran par tej gendbaaj liyaam plunket ne out kiya
 Opener Shikhar Dhawan, who was a flop in the first match, could not do anything special in this match and was run out after scoring just 10 runs
 5 over main 22 ran par teen wicket girane ke baad team india ekadam se baikfoot par aa gai
 After the initial three wickets fell early, Daromdar came on skipper Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina
 donon hi anbhavi ballebaaj sadhi hui ballebaaji kar rahe the
 The dangerous looking pair was broken by leg-spinner Abdul Rashid
 unhone raina ko 27 ke nijee score par butler ke haathon stump karaayaa
 Kohli and Raina shared a 57-run partnership for the fourth wicket
 raina ke out hone ke baad ballebaaji karne utre mahendra singh dhoni ne kohli ke saath morcha sambhala
 Virat and Dhoni could have stayed at the crease, but the pace of scoring runs could not be much faster
 isse pehletim indiabade score tak pahunchati, 111 ran ke score par ek or bada jhatka laga
 Captain Virat Kohli left Dhoni with a score of 47 runs
 iske baad ballebaaji karne utre olerounder hardik pandya bhi ummiido ke mutabik ballebaaji nahin kar sake
 He remained unbeaten on 12 runs
 iske liye unhone 10 genden kheli
 It is good for Dhoni who got the color in the last over
 ball ke aakhri over main dhoni ne teen chauke jamaaye
 a total of 22 runs were scored in this over which helped India reach a respectable score
 kul milakar cardiff main bhartiya ballebaaji berang dikhi, jiskaa puraa phayda england ke gendbaajon ne uthaaya or unhone team india ko 150 ran se neeche roak diya

 But many such leaders could not come out of their mafia image even in politics

 17 saal kii umr main pehla mukademaajawaani kii dahalij par kadam rakhte hi atik ahamed ke khilaaf pehla maamla darj hua tha or wo mukadmaa tha hatya kaa
 The point is in 1979 when Atik Ahmed was accused of murder at the age of 17
 uske baad atik ne peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Year after year the pages of his crime book were being filled
 atik ke khilaaf darj hai 44 maamlesaal 1992 main elahabaad police ne atik ahamed kaa kaccha chittha jari kiya tha
 In which it was told that not only Lucknow, Kaushambi, Chitrakoot, Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, but also in the state of Bihar, cases of murder, kidnapping, extortion are registered against Atiq Ahmed

 Mayawati came to power in Uttar Pradesh in May 2007
 atik ahamed ke hausale post hone lage
 One case after another was being filed against him
 isi dauraan atik ahamed underground ho gaye
 Atiq Ahmad became MP on the ticket of SP from Phulpur in the 2004 general election after the murder of MLA Rajupal
 iske baad elahabaad pashchimi vidhansabha seat khaali ho gai thi
 The by-election was held in this seat

 Discussions have started on the current status, needs and definitions of cleanliness, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's much publicized sanitation campaign
 dilli kii aitihaasik mahatv vaali valmiki basti main jhaadu lagaakar pradhanmantri ne swayan is abhiyaan kii aguwai kii

 kareeb 60 hajaar karod rupee ke bajet se desh ko gandagi mukt banane or har naagarik ko shauchalay uplabdh karaane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 The dream of smart cities in Japan and America has come into the eyes of the Indian middle class
 camere ke flash chamak rahe hai
 But will this campaign really do the cleaning that India needs? Is cleanliness of the roads the only cleanliness? If the government wants to instill a collective consciousness among the citizens to keep their surroundings clean, then what is wrong? From the environmental point of view, does this cleanliness drive have any special significance or not? Or is a dirt-free India like 'poverty-free India' a dream with no expiry date? Despite all the limitations, what is the harm in considering it a necessary initiative? All these questions become even more present when we are also unaware of the fact that how much muddy water is produced in our country

 He sees a sense of shame towards the dirt at the core of this campaign and considers it more 'lip-granddaughter' at the initial stage
 unke mutabik, 'gaanv kaa koi shaks shahar main jaakar samrudh hue apane rishtedaar ke paas jane main jaisi shame mahasoos karata he, yah vaisaa he
 The dirt should not be seen while walking on the road, otherwise it will become disrespectful

 There is no sense of knowing the well-being of its people

 Actually, we have stopped accepting public spaces

 If we get anything from this campaign, it is a very good thing

 We tell how much our arrangements are on the level of the drainage of dirty water
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki hamen isaki koi jaankaree nahi he ki ham kitna mailaa pani paidaa karte hai
 He says that in 1999, the NDA government conducted such a survey for the first time
 300 shaharon main se sirf 100 shaharon main kisi tarah kaa (chaalu yaa kharaab) siver system paaya gaya
 The ICRER organization gave a report in 2011, according to which only 300 of our 5161 small and big cities have some kind of sewer system
 iti hub kahe jane vaale bengalooru or hyderabad main aadhe se bhi kam ghar siver system se jude hai
 The purpose of laying more toilets is to lay sewer drains

 According to the last official data of 2005, 3825 crore liters of sloppy water is produced daily in about 500 of our cities
 kul milakar us samay (2011 main) 231 sivej plant the or 38 banaae ja rahe the
 If all these plants work to their maximum capacity then 1178 crore liters of dirty water will be cleaned every day

 About 45 per cent of the total installed capacity is in Delhi and Mumbai only

 Sopan says that there is no problem in building toilets
 sarkaar ke liye aasaan kaam he, eent kii choti si charadivari or chat bananaa
 But these toilets are hardly going to increase without the drain of dirty water
 unke mutabik, 'yah tab hoga jab aap samasya kaa saamana karenge, usase bhaagenge nahin

 Based on the previous elections and existing alliances of Tamil Nadu, it can be said that the party which has 36 in the assembly elections due this month
 5 fisadi mat hasil ho jaae, vah jeet hasil kar sakati he
 If DMK chief Karunanidhi and his allies in favor of Congress 5
 75 fisadi voton kaa zyada jhukaav ho jaataa he to wo jayalalita ke haath se satta chin sakate hai
 It is a matter of fact that Jayalalithaa had won the last two big elections
 jayalalita kii ediemke ne 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main baari jeet hasil kii thi, lekin tamilnadu ne varsh 1984 ke baad se kabhi bhi ek party ke paksh main duusari baar vot nahin diya
 The big two parties of the state - AIADMK and DMK - have been winning the assembly elections in turn
 yah bhi gaur karne vaali baat he ki jin partiyon ko aam chunaavon main jeet hasil hui ho, vidhansabha chunaavon main unke vot pratishat main giravat darj kii jaati rahi he
 There is clearly a third front in the fray for the first time in this time elections in the state
 dmdike ke captain vijayakaanth or purv kendriya mantri ambumani ramdos kii party piemke ke netritv main anya chote dalon kaa pipuls welfare front tamilnadu kii sabhi 234 siton par chunaav lard rahaa he
 This means that there has been a sharp decline in the IOU i
e
 Index of Opposition Unity, and only 36 due to vote sharing
 5 fisadi voton ke aadhaar par 118 siton ke bahumat ke aankade ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 The ruling AIADMK, with its smaller allies, may get 38 to 44 per cent (ie 42 per cent on average) votes, based on past statistics and existing alliances
 iskaa matlab he ki sattadhari gathbandhan 195 siton par par baari jeet hasil karegaa
 The dmk-congress alliance has an average 31 per cent vote share, which means it will only get 46 seats
 tisare morche ko 14 fisadi vot or do siten milane kii sambhaavna he or anya ko 13 fisadi vot or 9 siten mil sakati hai
 The comments lekin jayalalita ke cote ke teen fisadi vot yadi diemke gathbandhan ke paksh main chale jaaen to iskaa matlab hoga ki diemke kii jholii main 62 siten aa jaaengi
 If five per cent of the vote goes up in his (DMK) favor, it gets 99 seats and 5
 75 fisadi vot swing par 120 siton ke saath use bahumat hasil ho saktaa he
 In such a case, AIADMK will get 94 seats
 yadi ediemke se 7 fisadi voton kaa jhukaav diemke kii ore ho jaataa he to iskaa matlab hoga ki diemke kii siton kaa aankada 143 tak pahunch jayega or jayalalita kii party sirf 70 siton par simatakar rah jaaegi
 Although most states do not see the manipulation of 7 per cent of the votes from one election to another, Tamil Nadu has seen an average change of 10 per cent of the votes since 1984
 tamilnadu main 16 may ko matdaan he or maton kii ginati 19 may ko hogi

 But if three percent of Jayalalitha's quota votes go in favor of the DMK alliance, it would mean that the DMK will get 62 seats
 yadi paanch fisadi vot uske (diemke) paksh main bad jaae, to use 99 siten or 5
 It can get a majority with 120 seats on a 75 per cent vote swing
 aisi surat main ediemke ko 94 siten hi milengi
 If 7% of the aiadmk's vote shifts to the DMK, it would mean that the dmk's tally will reach 143 and Jayalalithaa's party will be reduced to just 70 seats
 haalanki adhiktar rajyon main ek chunaav se duusare chunaav tak 7 fisadi voton kaa herpher nahin dekha jaataa, lekin tamilnadu main 1984 ke baad se ausatan 10 fisadi voton main badlaav dekha jaataa rahaa he
 Tamil Nadu has voting on May 16 and counting of votes will take place on May 19
 yadi ediemke se 7 fisadi voton kaa jhukaav diemke kii ore ho jaataa he to iskaa matlab hoga ki diemke kii siton kaa aankada 143 tak pahunch jayega or jayalalita kii party sirf 70 siton par simatakar rah jaaegi

 haalanki haal hi main mulaayam ne ise apni ‚Äò‚Äòbadi bhul‚Äô‚Äô qaraar diya he
 In November 2008, a few days after the cbi's Yes, Never Faith vote, the then Solicitor General
 i
 Vahanvati submitted her report to the government and advised that the property of Dimple Yadav and Mulayam's late wife Malti Devi should not be clubbed as both are not public servants
 unhone mulaayam kii sampatti kii gananaa ko galat tehraaya
 Subsequently, CBI filed an application in the Supreme Court on 6 December 2008 to withdraw the demand for a detailed inquiry against Mulayam Singh and his family
 isamen sibiai ne kaha ki vah aisa centre sarkaar kii salaah par kar rahi he
 But when there was no electoral alliance between Congress and SP in 2009, in March 2009, CBI took a U-turn and asked the Supreme Court for permission to sue Mulayam
 supreme court ne sibiai kii daleel par apana nirnay surakshit kar liya
 But on December 13, 2012, the court asked the CBI to continue the investigation against Mulayam Singh and his sons
 dimple yadav ko isamen raahat di gai
 It will be difficult for the cbi's u-turnupa government to keep its ambitious food security bill in Parliament in this monsoon session
 If the Supreme Court is thinking of filing a closure report in the property case, then the Yadav family also wants to practice silence
 mulaayam ke khilaaf mukademe kii pairvi karne vaale chaturvedi to yahaan tak kehete hai ki agar sibiai ne mulaayam singh ko bachaane kii koshish kii to ve supreme court main pradhanmantri manmohan singh or mulaayam ke bich saudebaaji ke dastavej pesh kar denge
 Supreme Court lawyer Virag Gupta says, "the CBI wants to save Mulayam, who has become a necessity for the existence of UPA, by giving him technical benefits
" isse saaf he ki satta ke samikarnon se sibiai kii jaanch prabhavit hoti he
 "although the CBI is denying any such initiative, but Mulayam Singh met with unintended Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 yah puraa maamla sibiai kii manshaa par sawaal uthaane kaa adarsh udhaaharan he
 CBI has also tried to peep into Mulayam's personal life involving younger son Prateek in his report, so Prithviputra wants to get rid of this body as soon as possible
 lekin achaanak sibiai you-turn kyon le rahi he? iskaa jawaab agency ke purv nideshak joginder singh dete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòsarkaar jaisaa chaahegi vaisaa hoga
 CBI is tied on all sides
 har str par sarkaar se ijaajat chahie
 He gets the same lawyer as the government gives
 vakil adaalat main kah denge ki cese band karnaa chahie to sibiai kya kar legi?‚Äô‚Äôpehle bhi dikhaa he sibiai kaa bhaypichley varsh 13 june ko mulaayam singh yadav ne trinmul congress kii netaa mamata ke saath milakar rashtrati chunaav ke pehle achaanak is pad ke liye congress kii pehali pasand pranab mukherjee or duusari pasand hamid ansaari ke naam ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 He preferred former President A
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam kaa naam oochaal diya tha
 But he could not maintain his stand even for 24 hours
 agle hi din mamata banerjee ko akelaa chhod ve congress kii god main ja baithe
 In the General Budget of February 26, 2010, when the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee announced the increase in excise duty in petrol and diesel, the entire opposition including Mulayam united
 vipakshi ekajutata ke baad shkat moshnya (katautee prastaav) laane kaa elaan hua to prastaav vaale din 27 april ko mulaayam singh ne loksabhaa se vakout kar vipaksh ke katautee prastaav ko girwane main sarkaar kii madad kii
 Before the walkout, Mulayam had demanded a grant for the farmers, poor and unemployed in the House, but instead of pressurizing them, he left the ground
 iske alaava tuji spectrum main sanyukt sansadeey jaanch samiti (jepisi) gathit karne ke masale par mulaayam ne sarkaar ko raksha kavach diya tha
 Not only this, the opposition increased pressure on the SP again when opposition solidarity began to dismiss the JPC report
 sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne pichley varsh 16 disambar ko kaha tha ki epadi or pramotion main cote kaa virodh karne ke kaaran centre sarkaar sapa supremeo ko sibiai kaa dar dikhaa rahi he
 It is obvious that the Congress made Mulayam as a pawn to save the government, even after being accused in UPA-1, this wrestler of the arena made every effort to get the CBI sword hanging over him
 -saath main piyush babele The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the Center on a plea that changed the hanging of 1993 Delhi Blast case convict Devender Pal Singh Bhullar to life imprisonment
 bhullar ne yah yachika raashtrapati dwaara uski faansee kii sajaa ko maaf karne kii yachika par faisla lene main kii ja rahi deree or maansik swasthya ke aadhaar par daayar kii he
 a bench of Supreme Court Chief Justice p Sathasivam has stayed the execution of Bhullar
 court ne dilli sthit institute of human bihaviour and allide science se bhullar kii jaanch karaane or ek saptaah ke andar uske halaat kii report pesh karne kii maang kii he
 The notice has also been sent to the Delhi government
 court main is maamle par 19 farvari ko sunwaayee hogi
 The disaster in Kedarnath in June 2013 and the journey of reconstruction in the last five years has been adapted by Aaj Tak deputy editor Manjit Singh Negi into a book titled 'interview with Kedarnath'
 diwali ke din kedarnath main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko is kitaab kii ek prati bhent kii gai

 Regarding the book, well-known author Amish Tripathi has said that he is a true Shiva devotee and people should definitely read this book

 paanch saal pehle kedarnath main ai pralayankari baadh kabhi na bhuulane vaali ghatana he
 Manjit Negi has compiled the experiences of seeing and covering this destructive nature of nature and the subsequent effort to return the Kedar Valley to its divine and magnificent form
 ek tivi patrkaar hone ke naate unhone is aapadaa ko cover kiya or pichley paanch saal main aapadaa or punarnirmaan ke dauraan bhi vah kai baar kedarnath ja chuke hai
 It took the author 5 years to write this book because the hustle and bustle of TV journalism continued to create many hurdles, but the thought always kept in mind that the destruction of the natural orgy was to be executed in any case
 usee prayaas kaa nateeja rahaa ki kedarnath ghati main ai aapadaa ke baad punarnirmaan kii dastaan ''kedarnath se saakshaatkaar'' ke rup main aaj logon ke haath main he
 Colonel Ajay Kothiyal and his team have been instrumental in making the reconstruction work in Kedarnath successful
 unki team ne har mausam main yahaan punarnirmaan kaa kaam jari rakhaa
 At the same time, the government also left no stone unturned on its part so that the reconstruction work is now nearing its end
 barfbaari samet mausam kii mushkilon ke bich kedarnath main punarnirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 Colonel Ajay Kothiyal and his team are finalizing it in Kedarnath
 pradhanmantri modi 2019 ke chunaav se pehle kedarnath punarnirmaan ko puraa karnaa chaahate hai, isiilie unhone is par baariki se najar rakhi he
 It is believed that PM Modi wants to conduct the 2019 general election with Shankhanad Kedranath

 pehali najar mempuliceise aapasi ranjish kaa maamla maan rahi he
 You must have seen children in schools getting primary knowledge, in which teachers would be seen teaching pigeons from 'A' to children, rabbits from 'B'
 lekin kya kabhi aapane yah sochaa he ki aaazaad bharat main koi aisa bhi din aayega jahaan khule taur par bacchon ko saamaajik tanebane ko todane kii shiksha di jaaegi
 Let us introduce you to one such bitter truth, which is being given to the children of rural areas of Jharkhand these days
 'k' se kanoon, 'kha' se khanij'k' se kanoon, 'kha' se khanij-sampada adivaasiyon kii he, 'ga' gram sabha-jo sarvopari he, angah ang ang main roodhi vyavastha he
 Don't worry, this education is being imparted to the children by running the school
 ye paathyakram khunti jile ke murahu ilaake ke udburu gaanv kii roodhiwaadee gram sabha ne apane bacchon kii padhai ke liye jari kiya he
 In this course, even indecisive remarks have been made against even the first Prime Minister of the country, Jawaharlal Nehru
 kuch jatiyon ko bhi diku bataate hue unhen videshi kaha gaya he
 Right in front of this open school is the government school, where only two children are teaching regular courses
 darasaljharkhand membecchon ko is tarah padhaayaa ja rahaa he ki unke dimag main vahi baaten aaen jo gram sabha kahati he
 The course states - 'A' to law
 isaki vyakhya he- adivaasiyon ke paas apana kanoon he
 'B' means the mineral wealth of the tribals
 khunti jile ke chamadi, barbanda, bhandra, kudatoli, siladon panchayat sametaranchike bundu prakhand ke bedaa, panskam, hanjed gaanvon main gramsabha skool chalaa rahi he
 Among them, teachers selected by Gram Sabha teach
 iske peeche ke tark bhi ajeebogareeb he
 The village's Joseph Purti says that we are imparting our education to the children under the system of tribals
 vahin khunti ke jila shiksha adhikari kaa kahana he ki jo kuch ho rahaa he wo nishchit taur par acha nahin he
 It is said that if the social and economic fabric of any society is to be destroyed, then spoil the education of children
 yahi sab kuch gram sabha kii aad lekar kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the Gram Sabha was an old system which was empowered to take decisions in favor of the villagers

 Abbas also described the 90 and 40 overs format of the Moinuddaula tournament as interesting
 unhone kaha, 'pehali baar maine 90 or 40 overon ke toornament ke bare main suna

 lekin yah acha praaroop he
 ' agar aap parlor jaati hai to aapako bahut acchhee tarah pataa hoga ki bleech karaane se kya hota he
 Nowadays there are many such bleach creams in the market which are very easy to use
 aise main log ab ghar par bhi bleech karne lage hai
 Bleaching causes unwanted hair to become skin colored and the skin is uniform
 oxi bleech yaa phir alovera bleech karne se twachaa ko poshan bhi miltaa he lekin bleech karne ke dauraan hui ek choti si galati bhi baari pad sakati he
 In such a situation, it is very important that if you use bleach at home, then take care and choose the bleach according to your skin
 1
 If you are going to use bleach for the first time, instead of applying it directly to the face, apply a patch test on your hand
 agar aapako jalan nahin ho rahi he to iskaa matlab he ki bleech aapaki twachaa ke liye thik he
 But if you are jealous, do not forget to apply it on your face
 2
 Bleach should not be applied too close to the eyes, eyebrows and lips
 par agar lagane ke dauraan galati se in jagahon par lag bhi jaae to use turant saaf kar len
 3
 jab bhi bleech khariden, to kisi acchhee company kii hi khariden
 Nowadays bleach is available for every screen type
 aise main bleech kharidte samay uski gunvattta or expyri date jarur dekh len
 4
 bleech ko acchhee tarah utaarne ke baad hi twachaa ko halke geele kapade se ponchna chahie
 When the bleach is thoroughly cleaned, then massage should be done with a good moisturizer

 mantralay ne yah bhi poocha ki maujuuda loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh kaa naam ab tak tay nahin ho paaya he, lihaaja yah saaf kiya jaae ki netaa vipaksh kise mana jaae
 Should the Leader of the Opposition Lead the Opposition or Should the Leader of the Largest Group of Opposition Parties Be Given the Status? In fact, the Ministry of Personnel is concerned that many major institutions and departments should retire in the coming years
 And there should not be any constitutional crisis in the appointment of new chiefs
 mushkil yah he ki bina netaa vipaksh kii sahmati ke in padon par kisi ko bithaaya nahin ja saktaa
 For instance: 1
 mukhya soochna ayukta rajeev maathur agle maheene yani agast, 2014 main ritair ho rahe hai
 The consent of the leader opposition is necessary for the new chief
 2
 Chief Vigilance Commissioner Pradeep Kumar is retiring in September 2014
 3
 CBI director Ranjit Sinha is also retiring in November 2014
 lokapal act ke mutabik ab sibiai pramukh kii niyukti ke liye bhi netaa vipaksh kii sahmati jaruri he
 4
 isi tarah rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ke adhyaksh keji baalkrishna agle saal ritair ho rahe hai
 Now in his place, the approval of the Leader of the Opposition is necessary
 philhal pradhanmantri ke adheen aane vaale carmik mantralay ke afasar is baat se pareshaan hai ki aane vaale maheenon main sibiai yaa phir sivisi ke nae diarector kaa naam kaise tay kiya jaae
 In fact, when the officials first tried to clear the picture on the issue of Leader Opposition from Lok Sabha Secretariat, the Lok Sabha has clearly stated that the issue of Leader Opposition has not been decided yet
 iske baad yahi sawaal afasaron ne kanoon mantralay ko likhakar bheja
 The truth is that the Lok Sabha Secretariat first got entangled over these questions and now the Law Ministry is entangled

 tippaniyan The four-day match played at the Karachi Gymkhana Ground by the Railways was won by an innings margin in two days, due to which Sharif did not get a chance to bat in the second innings

 Postcards issued by the Indian Postal Department are sold for just 50 paise, whereas the cost of making a postcard is much higher
 dak vibhaag kii 2016-17 kii report ke anusaar, ek saadhaaran postcard par 12
 It costs 15 rupees, in return only 50 paise comes to the public exchequer and it is only 4 percent of the total cost of construction
 is tarah se sarkaar ek postcard par 11

 But now the postcard war that has started between BJP and TMC is like using government resources unnecessarily
 ek postcard banane par 12
 It costs 15 rupees and if it is multiplied by 30 lakh postcards being sent, then this cost 3
 64 karod se zyada tak pahunchataa he
 BJP will send 10 lakh postcards like this, the expenditure of the government will increase
 21 karod rupye se zyada or tiemasi 2
 43 crore rupees will increase unnecessary expenditure
 jis hisaab se waar jor pakad rahaa he usase aisa lagata he ki postcard kii sankhya 30 lakh ko bhi paar kar jaaegi
 If the number of postcards has crossed the 30 lakh mark, the loss of the government will increase further
 dak vibhaag centre ke adheen he to sara kharch centre ko hi vahan karnaa padegaa
 Also, the use of more than 30 lakh postcards from these two parties will have an impact on their demand and to compensate for this, more postcards will have to be printed which will cut trees in large numbers and harm the environment
 vahiin postcard kii kami hone se rokane ke liye aanan-fanan main har jagah uplabdhta sunishchit karaane ke liye khaasaa sangharsh bhi karnaa padegaa
 The biggest thing is that the postcards sent to both the parties are merely symbolic and will be thrown in the trash later

 jab unka road sho nikal rahaa tha, tab chowk ilaake main sadak kinare maujuud logon kaa ek group har-har modi or modi-modi ke naare laga rahaa tha
 In the video it is seen that on one side the slogans of modi-modi are being raised, on the other hand, the sadhushadeers who came on the call of Computer Baba in support of Digvijay Singh, are going out in silence on the road show
 haalanki is dauraan kisi tarah kaa takaraav dekhne ko nahin mila
 @ computerbaba3 took out road show in support of @ digvijaya_28, slogans of every @narendramodi in the Chowk area @ drhiteshbajpai @ ndtvindia @ ajaiksaran @ shailendranrb @ BJP4MP @ sunilcredible # modihiaayega # bjppic

 com / 5ah8eqp2hr In Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, the battle has now become Sadhu vs Sadhvi
 bijepi se pragna thakur (pragya Thakur) ke namakan main pahunche sadhu-santon ke baad ab baari digvijay singh (digvijay Singh) kii he
 In his support, the saints led by Computer Baba have camped in Bhopal for the next three days
 kohefija ke safia college main saadhuon ne tej garmi main digvijay singh kii jeet ke liye hathyog shuru kar diya he
 Digvijay Singh himself arrived here on Tuesday morning and offered prayers at sant-samagam with his wife
 unhone jeet ke liye santon se aashirwad maanga
 To support Digvijay's political platform, now the sage's siege has been made by Computer Baba, a minister in the BJP government
 namdev tyaagi urf computer baba (computer Baba) pragna thakur kii daavedaari par kehete hai 'unhen ko kuch maaloom nahin he, bali kaa bakra bana diya
 When NDTV asked if they did not consider Pragya to be a Sadhvi, Computer Baba said "sadhu will not be with the murder, not with the bomb blast, not with terrorism, with religion
" ' centre kii modi sarkaar par tippanee karte hue unhone kaha ki 'ram mandir nahin to modi nahin 
 
 
 Everyone has kept thinking that Ram and Ram is the same time, change two watchmen
 'vaise sab badalane nikle baba ne kuch maheene pehle NDTV se kaha tha ki ve congress main nahin jaaenge
 It is a different matter that they have changed now
 bhopal main sadhvi banaam sadhu kii ladaai main bijepi palatwaar kar rahi he to munh se dohe nikal rahe hai
 Pragya Singh Thakur said on the gathering of the sadhus, 'nirmal man jana so mohi paava, mohi treachery deceit punch not na bhava
 ' vahiin bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra kaa kahana tha 'ab pachhataavat kya hot he, jab chidiya chug gai khet
 
 
 First Digvijay Singh called Hindus as terrorists, now they are worshiping in front of saffron
 'computer baba kaa daawa he ki maidan main 13 akhaadon se 7000 sant jute hai, jo pehle tap phir road sho karenge
 But some saints also met who did not know that the stage was political, so they left the pandal
 karalidham se aae janakidas ne kaha 'road sho karenge
 
 hamen kya lenaa, hamako is bare main jaankaree nahin
 'premdas Bairagi who came from Pune said,' There is a political party campaigning here
 chale jaaenge ham to sadhu hai, dharm ke liye jite hai, marate hai, sadhu bane hai
 'ramchander Das who came from Gujarat said,' All the Mahatmas have been captured
 sabane kaha rasoi he, isliye aae hai
 We do not know anything
 ' Power is gained by worshiping Maa Durgaki
 maa durga kaa pujan, durga saptshati kaa paath,vratakarke aap bhi maa bhagwati se vishesh aashirwad praapt kar sakate hai
 Know what to do and what not to do to please Mother Durga
 
 
 kya karen-1- maa durga ke 108 naamon kaa jaap karen
 2- Must burn Akhand Jyoti in your house
 3- subah, shaam donon samay maa durga kipujakaren
 Before starting the puja, do meditation of Ganesha
 4- mantra jaap yaa puja ke turant baad bhojan naa karen
 5- Offer fruits, peta daily to girls under 12 years of age
 kya naa karen-1-durga maa kaa mantra jaap karte samay sharir ko hilaaein nahin, ga ga karmantrajaap naa karen
 2- Maintain purity in mind and thoughts
 3-navaratri main apni maa or maa kii umr kii mahilaon kaa apmaan naa karen, unka aashirwad praapt karen
 4-do not use deceit, fraud and profanity
 5-brahmacharya kaa paalan karen, galat logon kii sangati naa karen
 However, the nda's leaders, who have made all these claims, have denied any such possibility in the coalition
 varisht netaaon ke anusaar gathbandhan pehle kii tarah hi majboot he or hamaara koi bhi vidhayak kahin jane ko taiyaar nahin he
 (from input language) soshal media ke is daur main photography or photose ko share karne chalan kaaphi teji se bad rahaa he
 Talking about sharing photos, Instagram is the best option at this time
 lakhon log in dinon apni photose instagram par share karte hai vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo photose share kar jamkar paisa kama rahe hai
 Troubled by the boss, left the job and started business, now a millionaire, Neel Patel, a resident of Gujarat, is very fond of traveling and he often shares his photos on social media
 unki lee gai tasveeron ko khub pasand kiya ja rahaa tha
 After which he wondered why not earn money by sharing photos
 nil ne instragram par ek apana ek pej banaaya or photose share kerani shuru kin
 The photos Neil shared depicts the life of a normal boy
 dhire-dhire kar unki ye tasviren logon ko pasand aane lageen
 These tribal children study in IIT, it was completed like this, the pictures of Sapananil were spent most of the time in the life of the farmer and the time spent with poor children
 jiske baad instragram par unke folbers teji se badhane lage
 Anchal did India's name like Roshan, Modi also praised the likes of many companies

 jiske baad nil ne apana puraa samay photography ko diya
 His work progressed and he joined several tourist companies and advertising companies
 unhen ek travel company se photography ke liye ofer bhi mila
 According to Neil, he gets 25 thousand rupees for a photo
 is tarah ve maheene main kareeb ek lakh rupye tak kama lete hai
 While the slogan of 'ab ki baar Modi Sarkar' created Modi's air across the country, 'bihar is outside Bihar Nitish Kumar Hai' decided that Nitish is going to take over Bihar for the third time
 in donon naaron ko gadhane vaale prashanth kishor ne raajnneeti main planning or piaar ko shaamil kiya
 Many political parties are now contacting Prashant and his team
 in donon hi chunaavon main majboot netaa ke alaava jo ek khaas cheez thi wo thiprashanth kishor kii planning
 Prashant Kishore, who had designed Modi's campaign strategy in the Lok Sabha elections, was approached by Nitish for the Bihar elections
 prashanth kishor kii ranneeti yahaan bhi kaam ai or nitish kumaar kii aguwai main mahagathbandhan ne baari safalataa darj kii
 It is yet to be determined to what extent Prashant Kishore's strategy is real in both these elections, but this new and professional use of political propaganda is in the way of becoming an industry
 PR kaa nayaa thikaana raajnneeti
 
 
 Now people of communication and public relations are also looking for land in politics which till now used to look towards the world of business
 kai piaar agenciyaan raajnneeti ke kshetra main kismat aajamaane par vichaar kar raheen hai vahiin kai sanchaar visheshgy rajanetaaon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa sanbhaalane ke liye qamar kas rahe hai
 There is also speculation that people have started contacting Prashant Kishore and his team in the wake of upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh
 is tarah kii bhi khabaren hai ki kishor abhi apni nayi bhoomika ke bare main turant koi faisla nahin karenge
 This is also because people will have high expectations from him after the success in Bihar elections and his success with Team Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections before that
 lagbhag sabhi bade raajnneetik dal kishor jaise ranneetikaron kii madad lenaa chaahate hai or aagaamee rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte hue swatantra agenciyon kii puch bad gai he
 West Bengal and Assam are going to have elections next year and then Uttar Pradesh elections in 2017
 raajnneetik dal bhi chaahate hai profeshnal madaqasam chunaavon ke liye ek pramukh raajnneetik morche ne nai raajnneetik abhiyaan prabandhan company ‚Äòoakland brigs‚Äô ko kaam saunpa he vahiin yah company uttar pradesh kii bhi ek pramukh party se baatcheet kar rahi he
 It is being claimed that the company has started taking the services of some well-known international experts along with local experts and seems willing to work for more than one political party in other states
 company ke adhikariyon ne gopneeyata baratate hue un partiyon ke naam nahin bataaye jinke saath unki baatcheet chal rahi he
 No immediate comment could be received from Kishore and his team members as well
 teen mukhyamantriyon or do kendriya mantriyon ke liye kaam kar chuke swatantra jansampark salaahkaar anup sharma ke mutabikraajnneetik abhiyanonke dauraan matadaataaon kii dilchaspee badalati rahati he or raajnneetik sanchaar salaahkaar taaja rujhaan ko samajhane main madad karata he
 The protests by the Aam Aadmi Party over the increased fares of the metro continue
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ne shanivaar ko dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke ghar par jamkar narebaaji kii
 Although the police and paramilitary force stopped the protesters from sieging Manoj Tiwari's house much before, but despite this, the Aam Aadmi Party lashed out at the demand to refund the increased fares of the metro
 is virodh pradarshan main teen ilaakon ke vidhayakon ne aguwai kii or tab tak pradarshan jari rakhane kii dhamkee di jab tak badha hua kiraaya waapas na le liya jaae
 According to Gokulpuri MLA Fateh Singh, the mps of Delhi should also understand the pain of Delhiites and urge their government for increased rent
 lekin koi saansad aage nahin aayaa
 We (aam Aadmi Party) talked about taking half the loss of the government itself but still the government did not listen to one of us and increased the rent
 sabhi pradarshnkaree yun to apane haath me gulab kaa phool lekar shantipurna tareeke se apni baat rakhane aaye the lekin dhire-dhire unka gussa badhata gaya
 The protesters started running slippers and shoes on Manoj Tiwari's posters and the matter escalated
 maamle ko sanbhaalane ke liye police puri tainaati ke saath vahaan maujuud rahi
 Let us tell you that apart from Aam Aadmi Party Manoj Tiwari, the remaining 6 mps of BJP have also gheraoed for increased Metro fares
 pradarshnakariyon kii maane to jab tak kiraye ko lekar janata ko sahuuliyat nahin di jaati or bich kaa rasta nahin niklaa jaataa tab tak pradarshan jari rahegaa

 That is why they are now saying that the central government is revisiting this policy
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki gaanvon tak sadaken jaaengi to maowad par qaabu paanaa aasaan hoga
 The intention is to construct over 5,000 km of roads in 44 districts
 vaise sukama zile ke burqapal ke paas maovadi hamale main jo 25 siarpief jawan shahid ho gaye, ve vahaan sadak bana rahe mazaduron kii suraksha main lage the
 This is the second attack on CRPF personnel in Sukma in the last one and a half months

 The government is now talking about changing its Naxal policy

 For this, a meeting has been called on 8 May
 " However, the government talking about development has so far ignored crpf's proposal to use new road construction technology

 CRPF proposes that roads should be constructed in such dangerous areas through the new technology roadcem, but the state administration did not approve it
 -daleel ye di ki iske liye tender die ja chuke he, isliye mazaduron or ejiniyaron ko lekar in javaanon ko kai maheenon se aana-janaa pad rahaa tha
 CRPF argues that roads can be constructed quickly with this new technology
 ausatan har rose 2-3 kilometre kii sadak banaai ja sakati he
