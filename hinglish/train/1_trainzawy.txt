 Input: Language aaj ham ek aisi duniya main ji rahe hai, jisamen jad pakad lene vaali gambhir kism kii, chayapachayee yani metabolic or cancer jaisi bimaariyaan teji se bad rahi hai
 The rapid increase in the number of young people struggling with such health problems creates further concern because they are of this age to enjoy life to the fullest
 umr ke tisare dashak main dil kaa daura padane yaa cancer se peedit hone vaale rogiyon kaa dikhnaa ab aam baat ho gai he
 Having high blood pressure, diabetes and other serious diseases at an early age reduces the ability to face life's challenges and fills the mind with depression
 gambhir or metabolic rogon main teji aane ke kai kaaran hai
 These pathologies include diabetes, hypertension, heart arteries, intestinal diseases, osteoporosis and thyroid malformations
 bharat main har teen main se ek vyakti diabetes yaa haai bladpressure se jujh rahaa he or kareeb 12 fisadi aabaadi diabetes peedit he yani duniya bhar main ye rog sabase zyada bharat main hai
 Similarly, cancer has spread in every age group and in women and men equally
 chalis varsh se upar kii har teen main se lagbhag ek mahila stan cancer, garbhashay cancer, yaa osteoporosis se peedit ho sakati hai
 Similarly, problems like prostate cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and heart disease are increasing in men
 inamen se anek rogon ke peediton kii sankhya badaae ke peeche mularoop se genetic, jivan-style or parivesh sambandhi kaaran jimmedaar hai
 We have no control over genetic factors, but by changing our lifestyle and environment, we can try to avoid or avoid many of these maladies
 apane bachaav ke liye ehtiyaat ke taur par swasthya kii jaanch karana jaruri he taaki pataa chal sake ki sthiti kya he or khatre kii ashanka kahaan he
 We must remember that in most cases, early diagnosis can be the solution
 aam taur par log sawaal karte hai ki swasthya jaanch kii shuruyaat kis umr main honi chahie? ehtiyaati taur par swasthya kii jaanch isliye nahin karaani chahie ki ham aswasth hai, balki iskaa makasad to swasth rahanaa he
 Therefore, this work should be started as soon as possible before any disease occurs
 swasthya kii jaanch sabake liye ek samaan bhi nahin ho sakati
 Every woman or man should be examined according to their age, health and condition of diseases, presence of risk factors
 tees varsh ke swasth vyakti ke liye diabetes, haai bladpressure yaa hriday rog ke lakshanon kii pahchaan ke liye buniyadi jaanch se bhi kaam chal saktaa he lekin chalis varsh kii avasthaa main kisi swasth mahila ko stan or garbhashay cancer jaise rogon or swasth purush ko prostate cancer or hriday dhamni ke rog jaisi avasthaaon ke lakshanon kii jaanch karana bhi jaruri ho saktaa he
 In addition to this, other symptoms of risk may also need to be examined, depending on the living conditions, diseases in other family members and the person's own health
 bharat main 40 varsh se upar kii mahilaon ke liye osteoporosis, stan cancer, garbhashay yaa cervical cancer or metabolic vikrutiyon kii jaanch avashya honi chahie
 There are some general tests, apart from this, it may also be necessary to do some special investigation related to a person or a particular disease
 lagaataar modern hoti technology ke is yug main aajkal har rog vishesh ke lakshan bataane vaale anek prayogshaala sanket yani clinical lab biomarcurs bhi hai
 Similarly, for men over 40 years of age, it is necessary to check for heart and nerve diseases, prostate and lung cancer, kidney conditions when diabetes, metabolic malformations and gastrointestinal disorders
 hriday rog sambandhi vyapak jaanch main treadmill test, echocardiography or homocystin or lipoprotein-e jaise nishchit sanketak shaamil hai
 There is no doubt that consultation with a doctor is also necessary to discuss the risk factors, medical history for a particular individual, and to decide on necessary health check-ups
 aksar log isliye swasthya jaanch karaane se hichakate hai ki kahin koi gadabadi na nikal aae
 But remember, if there is really a reason for concern, the sooner you know, the sooner you will be able to get treatment and change your living and environment to stay healthy

 Following the Supreme Court's ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi, people along with businessmen turned to online sale and purchase of firecrackers, but now the firecrackers have stopped getting online
 darasal diwali se thik pehle dilli main pataakhon kii bikri par supreme court ne roak laga di he, jiske baad vyapaariyon ke saamne yah samasya khadi ho gai ki unhone jo lakhon rupye kaa pataakhon kaa stock taiyaar kar rakhaa he, uskaa kya karen

 When he heard about getting online firecrackers, he immediately sat on the computer and tried to order online fireworks, but he was disappointed
 online companiya pataakhe to de rahi hai, lekin dilli-ensiaar main nahin
 Online companies are also distributing firecrackers outside delhi-ncr
 sonu ne iske baad kuch duusari websiton se pataakhe kharidne kii koshish kii, lekin kisi bhi retail website par dilli main delivery kaa vikalp nahin aa rahaa tha

 lekin ab unhen diwali bina pataakhon ke manaani padegi

 sabhi log diwali par karol baag main ikattha hote hai or pataakhe chhodte hai
 But this time, after the ban on the sale of firecrackers, when they tried to buy firecrackers online, they also did not get firecrackers
 ab ve agra jaakar pataakhe kharidne kii soch rahe hai
 Online retail companies have written a message on their screens that there is a ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi, so people do not order firecrackers
 shuruyaat main kuch aanaline companiyaan pataakhaa kharidne ke icchhuk logon ko ek bank acount de rahi thim, jis par pataakhe kharidne vaale log paisa transfar kar saken
 Apart from this, some websites were also giving the option of cash on delivery, but for this a purchase of at least 5000 rupees was required
 haalanki pehle dukaanon se or ab online shopping citon se pataakhon kii bikri band hone ke baad dilli waalon ke paas diwali bina pataakhon ke manaane ke or koi chaara nahin bachaa he

 On this average, his form was questioned by Chief Selector MSK Prasad
 har mata-pita apane bachche ko rajdhani ke achche skool main daakhila dilaanaa chaahate hai, lekin point system kii maathapai or badalte guideline kii uljhan ne abhibhavakon ko tanavagrast kar diya he
 Nursery Admission: The new school of management quota directorate ended in 298 private schools in Delhi, the private schools built on DDA land are unhappy as well as the new formula of Neighborhood is not going to the parents
 aise main un abhibhavakon kii chintaa bad gai he jinke ilaake main ek kilometre ke daayre main achche skool nahin he
 The situation is that parents are now finding the process of admission to Oxford University easier than schools in Delhi
 nursery admician: jald jari hogi 298 skulon ke liye guidelinetrilokapuri main rahane vaale prashanth gupta apane nanhen-munnon kaa daakhila nursery main karana chaahate hai lekin rajdhani ke skulon main apane bacchon kaa daakhila karana itnaa aasaan nahin he
 According to Prashant Gupta, there is no good school around Trilokpuri, the schools in Mayur Vihar Phase One, where he wants to get his children enrolled, is about 2 kilometers from his house
 lekin dilli sarkaar ne abhibhavakon ko raahat pahunchane ke makasad se 0-1 kimi ke jis nebarhud formule ko didie kii jameen par bane skulon ke liye anivaary kiya he usase prashanth apane bachche ko achche skool main daakhil kara paaenge yaa nahin is baat ko lekar wo pareshaan ho gaye hai
 Although there are also parents who live around the school and are happy with the decision of compulsory admission of children nearby, but the concern of parents who live a short distance from the school has increased
 preet vihaar main rahane vaali nidhi khanna ke mutabik oxford uniwarsity main daakhila lenaa dilli ke nursery skulon main daakhila lene se zyada aasaan he
 The problem is that the government changes the rules of admission every year
 pichley saal kuch or niyam the, is saal kuch or
 If the government has to change the rules, then why not prepare it for 3-4 months in advance till talks with schools
 kam se kam daakhile ke dauraan ek spasht guideline ho, jise samajhnaa abhibhavakon ke liye aasaan ho
 We have been filling forms in different schools since January 2, each has a different point system, now different rules have come for schools with DDA land
 kya ho rahaa he kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa
 JNU: No election for gscash committee, for the first time, it is for the first time that not one, not two, but three types of rules are applicable for nursery admission in private schools of the capital
 pehali guideline nijee jameen par bane skulon ke liye jinamein daakhile kii prakriya 2 janvari se shuru ho chuki he
 Second, the rule of compulsory admission of nearby children for schools built on government land, about which there is confusion
 teesri, 25 fisadi EWS / DG ketegory ke liye guideline jo ki abhi tak jari nahin kii gai he
 Therefore, the parents of EWS category are also wandering from school to school due to lack of guidelines
 inamen zyaadaatar aise abhibhavak hai jo is baat se anjaan he ki abhi tak sarkaar ne EWS / DG ketegory ke liye koi guideline hi nahin jari kii he
 That is why they are going around the schools daily so that their child is not left behind in the admission race
 pratiyogi parikshaon kii taiyaari ke liye book fere main he bahut kuch khambhibhavakon kii samasya sirf is nae formule kii nahin thi, balki nae guideline ke jari hone ke baad bhi somvaar ko skulon se kisi tarah kii jaankaree nahin mil rahi thi
 In such a situation, when will enrollment in schools, the process will be online or offline, many questions forced parents to visit the school
 daakhile ke liye bane alag alag niyamon se pareshaan abhibhavakon daakhile ke is pench ke liye dilli sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai
 So the schools built on the land of DDA are also unhappy with the new formula of Delhi government

 In fact, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad fell out during a rally on Friday, so now he has tried to give it a different color

 He described it as a conspiracy between the BJP and the RSS, like a straightforward player in politics
 kehete hai ki siyasat or jang main sabakuch jaij he
 In the event of Motihari's rally, Lalu narrowly escaped, the RJD chief made it a weapon to garner votes in minutes

 The BJP immediately retaliated
 Now Lalu had alleged that the BJP also came back immediately

 ''adhiveshan main upasthit congress ke kareeb 15,000 kaaryakartaaon ne is baat par taaliyon kii gadagadaahat se apni khushi kaa izhaar kiya tha
 How much emphasis was placed on the youth was being seen from the stage itself and was a symbolic testimony to the departure of the old tradition — the big leaders of Congress were sitting on chairs in front of the stage, not on the carpet on the stage

 Difficulties keep coming in everyone's life
 jab ek mushkil ko khatm karke ham yah sochate hai ki chalo ab jindagi aaraam se kategi tab tak koi duusari pareshaani hamaare daravaaje par dastak dene lagati he
 Whenever we see a successful person, i wish we had such luck, or think how easily they got everything but it is not so
 in logon ne bhi vahi mushkilen or pareshaaniyaan jheli jo safalataa paane ke liye jhelni hoti he magar in pareshaaniyon se nipatane kaa tarika alag tha
 Know five problems that successful people did not think about: 1
 log kya sochenge:is duniya main zyaadaatar log apni marji se nahin balki dusron ko dekhakar yaa prabhavit hokar kaam karte hai
 Not only this, when they try something new, they start thinking about what people will think about it
 logon ke bare main sochane se pehle yah jaan lijie ki ve log kabhi bhi aapke vaastaviktaa ke bare main nahin baat karte hai
 They will either call you very good or very bad
 isliye unki parvaah karnaa hi bekaar he
 2
 dar:baat agar dar kii karen to yah hamaari kalpana se zyada kuch bhi nahin he
 Successful people know that if they do not take the risk and remain afraid, then success will never be achieved
 3
 Yesterday or the future: The life of most of us is spent thinking about what the future will be like
 bhavishya ke bare main sochakar hameshaa apane beete hue kal ko koste rahete hai
 This always causes the current to deteriorate
 safal vyaktihameshaa apane vartmaan ke har minute kaa sahi upyog karte hue aage badhata he
 4
 nakaaratmakataa:yah ek aisi cheez he jo hamaare har sapane ko barbaad kar saktaa he
 Whenever we want to do something, first of all we think 'no we will not be able to do it, we do not have the capacity to do it
 ' ye nakaaratmak vichaar hone vaale kaam ko bhi bigaad detaa he isliye jahaan tak sambhav ho nakaaratmakataa se bachani chahie
 5
 umr:aapako nahin lagata he ki umr bas ek sankhya kaa naam he
 The successful person never tells his age what he is and who he is? People have achieved great successes at the youngest age
 vahiin, zyada umr ke baavjood bhi logon ne apni mehnat se khud ko sabit kiya he

 congress lagaataar piem modi or bijepi par is ghotaale kaa dosha laga rahi he, to bijepi kah rahi he ki ye ghotaalaa 2011 main upie sarkaar ke dauraan hi hua tha
 Modi government has scammed it
 neerav modi ko pakadaney ke liye tej hui karrwaiufnbh mahaghotaale main suraksha agenciyon kii karrwai ne ab raftaar pakad lee he
 The CBI has sought the help of Interpol to nab Nirav Modi, the main accused in the scam
 iske liye duniya bhar ke airport ko notice diya ja chukaa he, taaki agar neerav kahin jane kii koshish kare to bhartiya agenciyon ko pataa chal sake
 PNB Mahaghotala: How will the 3 accused get remand, Nirav absconding, 11400 crores? Even before this notice was issued through Interpol, but it was for a few countries only
 ab ye notice duniya bhar ke liye he
 However, Nirav Modi has just said that the CBI has no firm information about this yet
 jeenyu (JNU) main chal rahegatirodh ko khatm karne ko lekar maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay (human Resource Development Ministry) ne ek hai power kamity kaa gathan kiya he lekin abhi tak isaki report ai nahin he or isse pehle hi prashasan ne aanan fanan main hostel manual ko lekar hai level kamity bana lee he
 a meeting of this committee has also been held in JNU and some changes have also been suggested but the question is why there is a competition to make one committee before another
 No concession is still given to the students and they are adamant on complete relief from the new hostel manual
 yah bhi padhein: JNU main hostel kii badi fees chaatro par aarthik boj nahin, 71 fisadi ko miltaa he anudaanbta den, jorbagh ke paas jeenyu ke chaatro par lathi charge kiya gaya tha
 Many were also injured in this
 chaatro ke sadakon par aakrosh ke baad maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne maamla sulajhane ko lekar teen sadasyeey hai power kamity banaai he par hai power kamity kii report se pehle jeenyu prashasan ne hai level kamity banaai or hostel manual ko lekar sifarish de di
 There is a provision in the new hostel manual to reduce the utility and service charge from Rs 2000 to Rs 1000
 saath hibipiel parivaar ke chaatro ko iske liye 500 ru hi dene honge
 However, the old hostel manual did not have provisions such as utility and service charge
 jeenyu chaatr sangh kii adhyaksh aaishi ghosh ne saaf kar diya he ki yah hadtaal jari rahegi
 We will only consider when the new hostel manual is completely withdrawn
 saath hi unhone sawaal uthaaya ki prashasan mahinebhar se koi kadam nahin uthaa rahaa tha or ab achaanak se ek kamity bana di, jab MHRD kii teen sadasyeey kamity ko report deni thi
 Apart from the students' union, the JNU Teachers Association also has reservations about the high level committee constituted by the administration
 jeenyu teachers association ke adhyaksh pro
 DK Lobial clearly said that this bargaining would not work without talks here
 aisa coporate main bhi nahin hota he or yah to uniwarsity he
 Here the decision should be taken under a system, not through some people in a closed room
 visi ko samajhnaa hoga ki bina baatcheet ke halaat nahin sudhar sakate
 The need is for everyone to take decisions with participation, not to impose their own decisions

 It is reported that now Rajnath Singh will become the new President of BJP
 khabaron ke mutabik bijepi main rajnath singh ke naam par muhar lag gayi he
 It is being told that the Sangh pulled back his hands due to the allegations against Gadkari, which made it difficult for him to become the president
 uske baad bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne istipha de diya
 In a conversation with our associate channel Aaj Tak, Gadkari said that he will not become BJP president again
 gadakari kaa kahana he ki wo aaropon se tang aakar istipha de rahe hai
 However, they also say that they will prove to be impeccable in the investigation and will return
 khabaron ke mutabik buudhvaar subah bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak hogi jisamen rajnath singh ke naam par aupchaarik muhar laga di jaaegi
 Wednesday morning at half past nine (9
 30) baje bijepi parliamentry board kii baithak hogi, jisamen rajnath ke naam par aupchaarik muhar lagegi
 Rajnath will fill the election papers for the post of president only after the meeting of parliamentary board
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke bade netaa mangalvaar din bhar aam sahmati banane kii koshish kar rahe the
 In Mumbai, LK Advani, Nitin Gadkari and Sangh leader Bhaiyya Ji Joshi appeared on a stage
 unamem kuch baat bhi hui, lekin adwani kaa mood ukhda-ukhda rahaa
 There was a meeting of BJP leaders in Delhi at 8 pm, in which Rajnath's name was agreed
 rajnath singh pehle bhi chaar saalon tak bijepi ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 In December 2005, he took charge of the party after the resignation of LK Advani
 2009 kaa aam chunaav bijepi ne rajnath ke netritv main hi ladaa tha
 But after the defeat of the NDA at the hands of the UPA in the general election, Nitin Gadkari was made BJP President in place of Rajnath
 upi ke mukhyamantri rah chuke rajnath philhal gajiabad ke saansad hai
 Meanwhile, BJP leader and former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha has said that he will not contest the election for the post of president
 yashavanth sinha ne mangalvaar din main adhyaksh pad ke liye hone vaale chunaav kaa nomination form mangavaya tha
 He had also submitted proof of being a fulltime activist of the party for taking nomination form
 yashavanth sinha ke is kadam se yah saaf ho gaya tha ki gadakari ke naam par bijepi main aam sahmati nahin he
 Significantly, the first lightning strike on Gadkari's intentions was done by Ram Jethmalani's son
 mahesh jethmalani pehle bhi gadakari ko bhrashtachar par aade haathon le chuke the
 He directly questioned the internal democracy of the party and said that he too needed nomination papers to contest the election of the president but was not getting it
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke liye 2014 jaise nattejey doharaana mushkil najar aa rahaa he
 Especially in the states of North India where the BJP eliminated the opposition parties in the last Lok Sabha election
 maujuuda daur main bijepi kaa sameekaran in rajyon main gadabadata najar aa rahaa he, aise main party is nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye 'mishan south gathbandhan' par jute gai he
 Let us know that Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are the five states in South India which have around 130 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke sansadeey chunaav main bijepi in rajyon se kul 20 siten hi jeet saki thi
 This is the reason why the BJP has given special focus to the Lok Sabha seats of these southern states
 iske liye wo kshatrapon ke saath gathbandhan karke apni jadon ko majboot karnaa chaahati he
 BJP has started an alliance with the political parties of South India
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki party adhyaksh amit shah tamilnadu main gathbandhan ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai
 However, the party tries that the alliance should be practical
 andhra pradesh main congress ke saath tidipi ke riste banate hue najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, BJP is trying to join hands with smaller parties before the elections
 angreji akhbaar indian express ne bijepi netaa se hawaale se likhaa he, 'in paanch rajyon main congress kii kamajori hi hamaari sambhaavnaaen he
 We are ahead of the Congress in taking allies together
 bijepi bahut behatar sthiti main he or sahyogi dalon ke saath teble par baithkar unki baton par khaas tavajjo detii he
 'BJP is considering TRS as its ally in Telangana
 darasal telugana main congress or tiares aamane-saamne hai
 In such a situation, BJP is expecting the TRS
 jabaki kerala main ai baadh ne bijepi kii sambhaavnaaon ko kam kar diya he
 In fact, the TDP, the only ally of the BJP in southern India, has now left
 iske alaava maharashtra main shivasena or punjab main akali dal ke saath bhi bahut behatar rishte nahin hai
 While in Bihar, RLSP has indicated to go with the Grand Alliance
 uttar bharat main kai rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai, vahaan satta-virdohi lahar kaa use saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Apart from this, the bjp's equation seems to be deteriorating due to the united opposition parties in many states
 aise main bijepi ko dakshin bharat ke rajyon se kuch ummiden dikh rahi hai
 The BJP is looking for an ally in Tamil Nadu under this strategy
 pradhanmantri narendra modi diemke pramukh rahe karunanidhi kii beemaari ke dauraan unhen dekhne pahunche or nidhan par chennai pahunchakar antim sanskaar main bhaag liya
 The DMK surprised everyone by inviting BJP President Amit Shah to a memorial meeting for Karunanidhi
 iske alaava diemke ke kaaryakari adhyaksh emke stallin, saansad kanimojhi purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii shradhanjali sabha main dilli pahunche
 After which political speculations are being made
 varisht netaa ne kaha ki is tarah ke sanket ko bijepi ke saath gathbandhan banane kii taiyaari ke rup main nahin dekha janaa chahie
 However, he said that the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu is not ideologically anti-bjp
 jabaki diemke bijepi virdohi khemen ke saath he
 Out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu, BJP won just one seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 rajya kii ek saamaajik-raajnneetik sanrachana he
 BJP leaders said that at present, Tamil Nadu is facing a situation in which one major regional party has become weak and the leadership of another is yet to get support
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki aise main modi ke naam par hamen iskaa phayda milegaa or log hamaare saath judege
 Apart from this, he said that BJP has managed to increase its vote share in Kerala
 haalanki abhi tak koi chunavi jeet nahin mili he
 After the consolidation of the party's position in Odisha, the seat of the southern states has become more important with the aim of the BJP returning to power
 bijedy ke khilaaf apane shuruaati hamale ke baad, monsoon satr ke dauraan donon dalon ke bich maamla shant he
 The bjd's move to vote with the NDA in the election to the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman has indicated a change in approach
 bijepi main kai log sochate hai ki vidhansabha chunaavon par dhyaan kendrit karne vaale kshetreey dalon ke puraane abhyaas or sansadeey chunaav ladane ke liye rashtriya dalon ko chhodkar waapas aa sakate he
 While there is not much scope for the Third Front
 aise main tiares or naveen patnayak endie ke saath aa sakate hai
 The hearing of the Babri masjid-ram Mandir dispute case is going on in the Supreme Court, but the ayodhyakeshadhu-santamandir is not in the mood to wait for construction
 centre kii modi or upi kii yogi sarkaar par dabaav banane ke liye somvaar se sadhu-sant aamaran anshan shuru kar rahe hai
 Ram Paramahamsa Das Mahant of the ascetic cantonment temple will fast for the construction of Ram temple
 ramnagari main ashok ke ped ke neeche anshan par baithenge
 Paramahansa Das told that this fast will continue till the construction of Ram temple is paved
 paramhans das ne kaha ki sabhi musalmaan chaahate hai ki ayodhya menram mandirka nirmaan ho
 Our fight is not with the Muslims
 unhone kaha ki hamen to bas ramamandir chahie ramajanm bhoomi duniya main kahin or nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, Muslims should cooperate in building Ram temple
 iskaa sandesh duniya bhar main jayega
 Sadhu saints said that Hinduist organizations have combined to hand over power to BJP
 iske baavjood bijepi ne abhi tak mandir nirmaan kii disha main koi kadam nahin uthaaya he
 He said that when the Modi government can bring other laws then why not bring the law for Ram temple
 paramhans das ne kaha ki modi kaa kaarykaal puraa hone ko he, lekin hamaari aakankshaayen abhi adhuri hai, isliye ab ham ramamandir ke liye swayan hi paurush karenge, iske liye jaan hi kyon na dena pade
 He said that information about the fast has been sent from the President, Prime Minister, Chief Minister to the district administration
 paramhans das ne bataaya ki mandir main pratidin shilapujan ke bhi kaarykram kaa shubharambh bhi somvaar se shuru kiya ja rahaa he
 This Shilapujan will also continue unabated until the temple is built
 unhone kaha ki shilapujan main pratidin sadhu-santon ke alaava rambhakt bhi maujuud rahenge
 As cashless transactions are increasing, so are cyber frauds
 aisa bharat main hi nahin balki jahaan bhi cashles iconomi kii shuruyaat hui vahaan hua he
 But compared to those countries, India has a poor case of cyber security
 khaas kar un logon ke liye jinhone smartphone, computer or internet yuj karnaa shuru kiya he
 Obviously, they are also banking through this
 banking karnaa yani samvedansheel jaankariyaan darj karnaa
 But sometimes hackers target new users very easily, for that they do not have much difficulty
 udhaaharan ke taur par aise kai maamle aae hai jahaan kisi baking ap yavebsite ke clon bana kar nae yugersko bevakoof bana liya jaataa he
 To prevent this, the Reserve Bank of India has given some instructions to the banks, which will arrange for the security of the users
 haalanki ham aapako surakshit rahane ke kuch tareeke bataate hai
 If you have recently started mobile or internet banking, then keep these things in mind
 - smartphone main kisi bhi pop ap ko clic na karen jisamen baking ke bare main jaankaree maangi ja rahi he
 - During the online transaction, first see if the HTTPS is installed on the website
 agar nahin he to band kar den
 In any case, do not write your username and password somewhere and do not share it with anyone
 - kai baar aapako email main ofer ke bare main mail aate hai jisamen likhaa hota he ki aap apane acount kii jaankaree darj karke ofer kaa labha le sakate hai
 Do not do like this at all
 - apane acount se apana mobile number register karaaen or har tranjaction ke baad massej dhyaan se padhein
 - Install premium anti virus in your computer and keep scanning it from time to time
 rigerv bank of india ne baikon se security system majboot karne ko kaha he
 To ensure that all banks and digital payment institutions are properly following these orders, the Reserve Bank has asked them to submit their detailed plans to the Department of Payment and Settlement by 21 December
 isamen unhen apane network kaa audit karaane ke liye auditor kaa naam or samay bhi dena hoga
 According to the Reserve Bank, the trend of online payment and cashless transactions in the country has been increasing rapidly since the closing of the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency
 aise main yadi bainkon athwa anya digital pement placeform par sibar atake yaa frod kii ghatnaayen cashles iconomi kii taraf badhate hamaare kadam ko roak sakati hai
 What will happen In this audit, companies auditing banks and digital payment platforms will closely study their hardware infrastructure, operating systems and critical programs
 audit companiyaan yah bhisunishchit karengi ki bank ke online pement getwe, atm mashin kaa communication placeform, point of cell mashiinon kii security durust or apadated hai ki nahin
 In addition, this audit will also decide whether banks have taken all necessary steps for security or not
 saath hi kisi durghatana yaa sibar atake kii sthiti main unki recovery karnaa or staff ko kisi bhi sthiti se nipatane ke liye training dena bhi shaamil he

 In 2010, the Allahabad High Court had ordered the disputed land to be divided into three parts, but that decision was challenged in the Supreme Court, under which the Ayodhya dispute would be heard on a case-related suit (a case relating to land ownership)

 After the crushing defeat in all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, now the Arvind Kejriwal government has focused its attention on the assembly elections
 agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main kahin loksabhaa jaisaa hashr na ho, iske liye party apane aadhaar ko badhaane main juty he
 In this episode, the objective is to create a new 'women's vote bank'
 dilli metro or ditisi bason main mahilaon ko muft safar kii saugat ko isi se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 The Election Commission figures show that a total of 1
 43 karod matadaataaon main 64 lakh se zyada mahilaayein hai
 It is obvious that there is a considerable population of women
 aise main mahilaon ko khush kar vidhansabha chunaav main safalataa hasil kii ja sakati he
 It is believed that by targeting the same 64 lakh women voters, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party government has announced to give free travel to women
 somvaar ko dopaher is skim kii ghoshnaa karte hue mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki do se teen maheene ke bheetar suvidha shuru ho jaaegi
 Presentations have been sought from the departments
 haalanki unhone kaha ki sabsidi thopi nahin jaaegi
 Women who are able can travel with a ticket
 lakhon mahilaon se judi is skim ko aam aadmi party sarkaar kaa masterstroke bataaya ja rahaa
 Talking about the Delhi Metro, on an average, over 26 lakh passengers travel on various routes every day
 isamen kareeb 30 se 33 fisad mahilaayein hotin hai
 In this way, with the free ride decision of Kejriwal government, more than eight lakh women will be able to avail the facility of free travel in Delhi every day
 aisa bhi nahin he ki dilli main sirf aam jan hi metro se safar karte hai
 Facilitated families also like to travel by metro
 vajah he ki jam ke jhaam se juujhati dilli main metro hi ek sahaara he, jo samay se gantavy tak pahunchaati he
 Travel by Metro also saves money
 dilli kii aabhohawaa ke liye bhi phydemandasrdiyon ke mausam main jab dilli pradooshan kii chapet main hoti he
 Fog is visible all around
 tab metro, ditisi bason aadi saarvajanik parivahan ke sadhano ke kiraye main kami kar logon ko unke istemaal ke liye protsaahit karne kii maang uthati he
 With the introduction of free travel facility, the interest of traveling by metro will also be increased in those women who still use private vehicles to travel to the home or office
 nijee vaahanon kaa istemaal kam hone se pradooshan main kami hogi
 The Delhi Government will compensate for the loss suffered by DMRC in giving free travel to women
 ek aankade ke mutabik dilli metro or ditisi kii bason main is skim ke lagu hone se sarkaar par har saal kareeb 1200 karod rupee kaa boj padegaa
 a gift of cheap electricity and free water The Kejriwal government had tried to woo the public by making two big announcements after winning the 67 seats out of 70 seats in Delhi
 aam aadmi party sarkaar ne dillivaasiyon ko har maheene 20 hazaar litre muft pani or 400 unit bijli bill kii daren aadhi karne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 At that time it was said that 36 lakh families will be directly benefited from the reduction in electricity rates and 18 lakh from the freeing of water
 maujuuda samay kii baat karen to varsh 2018 se nai bijli daren nirdhaarit hai
 Last year, the government cut the charge from one to one and a half rupees per unit, although fixed charges were increased manifold
 march 2018 ke faisle ke mutabik vartmaan main 200 unit tak bijli istemaal par 4 rupee kii jagah 3 rupee prati unit kii dar lagu he, vahiin 201 se lekar 400 unit tak par 5

 Apart from this, payment of electricity bills ranging from 401 to 800 units 7

 Hon'ble Subhash Barala Ji, State President Bhajpa, Haryana, Mansurajpal Amu, BJP State Media Liaison Head, Distressed by the behavior of the Chief Minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Ji with the Rajput Samaj yesterday 
 saganthan ne jo sammaan va pad mujhe diya or saganthan ne jo bhi kaary mujhe diya, wo maine dil se kiya
 The BJP has given me the opportunity to work with many senior leaders not only from Haryana but with many senior leaders of the organization since 28 years
 pradesh bhaajapa saganthan main, prayek kaary ko jo bhi aapane mujhe saunpa wo maine mehnat or lagan se kiya
 i feel that Chief Minister Manohar Lal Jico is no longer required of dedicated and loyal workers and officials
 mukhyamantri manohar laal ji ke irdagird kuch avaanchit logon kaa ek samooh he, jo unhen bhaajapa ke nishthavan kaaryakartaaon se pichley teen varshon se dur kar rahaa he
 May God grant them goodwill
 mujhe ummid he ki aap mere is sandesh ko hi meraa istipha samajhenge or ise manjuur karenge
 i will continue to work as an ordinary worker in BJP
 aapkaa apana 'surajpal amu'
 What was the whole matter: Actually, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Rajput Karni Sena were to meet on Tuesday over the controversy over the film 'padmavati', which could not be done
 is par naaraaz surajpal amu ne mukhyamantri manoharlal par hamalaa bolte hue ise rajput birdari kaa apmaan qaraar de diya he
 Amu's displeasure was due to Khattar not meeting the Karni army about Padmavati, despite giving time
 amu ne kaha ki main pradhanmantri narendra modi se anurodh karata hum ki wo khatter se baat karen or puuchhen ki unhone unase milane aae rajput samaaj ke pratinidhimandal kaa apmaan kyon kiya
 The Chief Minister himself had given time for this and he left without meeting
 wo un logon se kyon nahin mili, jo rajasthan se unase milane aae the
 If they want us out of the party then do it, but do not insult us
 amu yaheen nahin ruke or kaha ki siem hamaare saath aisa bartaav nahin kar sakate
 i condemn the Chief Minister's behavior towards Mr
 Rajput Karni Sena President Sukhdev Singh
 main bijepi ke saath nahin rahanaa chahta, kyonki wo apratyaksh rup se hamaari beijjati kar rahe hai
 Amu attacked Khattar and said that i have been working with him for the last 22 years
 main unke bare main har cheez vistaar se jaanata hum
 He himself is from the village of Rajputs
 unhen desh ko apane badale hue vyavhaar ke bare main bataanaa hoga
 Jat, Saini and almost all the other communities are against him
 phir bhi ham unke saath shuruyaat se hai
 But now i think they need us no more
 jabapadmavatifilm rajasthan, madhya pradesh, gujarat main bain he to haryana sarkaar us par bandish kyon nahin laga rahi

 The BJP made this allegation by issuing a charge sheet titled 'ten years of the UPA government under the Congress leadership'
 aaropapatr main kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri karyaalay kii garima ko nasht karne main sonia or rahul baraabar ke bhagidaar hai
 They wanted to retain unlimited powers of power without any responsibility
 kai avasaron par ghatit baari galtiyaan or aniyamitataayen in donon kii sweekruti or anumodan se hui hai
 The charge sheet issued by BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Manmohan Singh made all kinds of compromises to save his chair
 pradhanmantri ne kisi bhi avasar par lagaataar ho rahe ghotaalon or janata ke paise kii lut ko rokane main sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 For this reason, this government was called the most corrupt government after independence
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki ghotaalon ke kai prakarnon main swayan pradhanmantri kii apni bhoomika andeh ke gambhir daayre main he
 The Prime Minister accused the BJP of acting as the CEO of a board headed by Sonia, where Rahul was his deputy
 aaropapatr main kaha gaya ki upie ke shashan main pradhanmantri pad kaa avamulyan hua, isaki garima ke saath samjhauta kiya gaya evam lachar shashan pranali kaa khamiyaja desh kii arthvyavastha ko bhugatna padaa or asuraksha kii bhaavana se desh kii rashtriya or antarrashtriya chhavi par gaharaa aghat laga
 It was also alleged that the Indian economy was destroyed in the 10 years of UPA rule
 isamen kaha gaya ki 2004 main jab upie ne satta sanbhali thi, us samay endie se use viraasat main 8
 The growth rate of 5 percent was achieved, but today these 4 after 10 years
 5 pratishat par aundhe munh gir gai he
 The chargesheet states that the government has completely failed to overcome rising inflation and unemployment and the decline in the value of the rupee during the UPA regime has never happened before
 vot bank kii raajnneeti ne kiya kamjoratankwaad ke sandarbh main isamen kaha gaya ki vot bank kii raajnneeti ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ko kamjor kiya he
 According to this, the prevalence and promotion of words like saffron terror by the ministers of the government has encouraged the terrorists and their masters
 aaropapatr main kaha gaya ki iske saath hi congress party aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane ke naam par lagaataar musalamaanon ko barbar police karrwai ke shikaar ke rup main chitrit karke puri bahes kaa sampradayikeekaran karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The arrest of innocents wrongly stated that wrongful arrests of innocent persons cannot be justified, yet the police action taken against terrorism is deliberately behind the tendency to deliberately portray it as targeted harassment against Muslims
 Dangerous and communal motives are hidden
 upie sarkaar par china kii dhamkiyon ke aage jhukne kaa aarope lagaate hue bijepi ne kaha ki iske chalate upie sarkaar dakshin china samudr main tel anveshanon ke kaary se peeche hat gai
 The party said that in order to pressure China, this government also failed to establish mutually beneficial relations with East Asian countries, especially Japan and Vietnam
 kamjor netritv ke chalate ham paak se dabepakistan kaa zikr karte hue bijepi ne kaha ki jammu kashmir main seemaa paar se ghuspaith or samvedansheel suraksha sthanon par aatmghaatee hamalon ke jariye aatankwaadi bharat ke khilaaf lagaataar gatividhiyon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 The entire country was outraged by the incident of beheading of Indian soldiers on the Pak border
 kamjor netritv ke kaaran ham pakistan ko apekshit jawaab nahin de sake
 The charge sheet said that by allowing the separatist leaders to visit Pakistan and meet the Pakistani authorities, the anti-india forces across the border have done their nefarious intentions in our country
 desh kii saakh dhoomil huiupie kii videsh niti kii aalochana karte hue aaropapatr main kaha gaya ki padosi deshon ke saath bharat ke raajnneetik rasookh main giravat ai he, jiske chalate pichley paanch saal ke dauraan hamaari videsh niti main na to aatmavishvaas dekhne ko mila or na hi suraksha muddon ko drushtigat rakhte hue apane padosi deshon ko china kii god main baithne se roak sake
 Our credibility with each neighboring country is tarnished

 The politics of Rae Bareli, which is considered to be a strong fort of the Congress, seems to be taking a new turn
 raibareli sansadeey seat par voting ke 8 din ke baad hi siyaasi varchasv kii jang tej ho gai he
 All the opponents in Rae Bareli have come together against Dinesh Pratap Singh, who has beaten up the BJP in the election ground against former Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 unhone dinesh pratap singh ke bhai avadhesh singh ko jila panchayat adhyaksh kii kursi se bedakhal karne kaa kavayad tej kar di he
 Please tell that before voting on the no confidence motion against District Panchayat President Awadhesh Singh in Rae Bareli, there was a lot of ruckus in the district
 raibareli sadar se congress vidhayak aditi singh lakhanu se raibareli ke liye jila panchayat chunaav main pahunch rahi thim
 Aditi Singh was accompanied by about 28 district panchayat members, including Zila Panchayat member Rakesh Awasthi
 aarope he ki avadhesh singh kii jila panchayat bachi rahe isliye dinesh singh ke aadmi lakhanu se raibareli ke puure raste par lage hue the
 They wanted to make sure that Aditi Singh could not reach Rae Bareli with the District Panchayat members
 iske baavjood aditi singh kaa kafila lagaataar raibareli kii taraf badhata ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, the Dabangas hit the vehicle of MLA and Zilla Panchayat members at the toll plaza of bachhrawan-lucknow route and started firing
 sadasyon par firing ke baad hi dabangon ne sadar vidhayak aditi singh kii gaadi kaa peechha kiya

 Akhilesh Singh, the uncrowned king of Rae Bareli politics, is running ill these days and his political legacy is being handled by Aditi Singh

 After this, Aditi Singh has managed to win her favorite in the municipal elections of Rae Bareli

" ''lekin unki kamyaabi ke peeche pielue (pipul like as, athwa hamakhyaal log) manch he, jise ve pradhanmantri ke saath saajha karte hai
 Both have turned from professional to political leaders
 donon samaan academik halkon main jate hai or dilli ke drawing room kii chuninda jamaavadon main donon aamantrit kiye jate hai
 Both contested from the same constituency in South Delhi — and lost in separate elections
 jab manmohan singh rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa hua karte the tab sibbal pehali baar saansad bane the lekin jaldi hi ve upree sadan main party ke pramukh vaktaa ban gaye
 At the same time, there was a better coordination between the two
 sibbal cabinet kii mej par jis package ke saath aate hai vah sonia gandhi or rahul, donon ko bhaataa haih chaahe vah harvard se kanoon kii degree ho yaa apane daftar kii diwaar par impreshnist art evam apni bedaag safed-kameez evam halke bhure pant kii tarah mistar clin kii chhavi ho
 He is the same type of professional leader about whom Rahul talks enthusiastically
 ek aisa shashi tharur, jisamen dikhaava kam or dam zyada he
 The 62-year-old minister says, "there is hardly any political party or corporate house that i would not have advocated
" lekin mujhe siyasat acchhee lagati he kyonki mujhe lagata he ki siyasat kaa canvas kanoon se kahin zyada bada he or aap jo hal nikaalte hai uskaa asar kabhi-kabhi puure itihaas ke dharre ko badal saktaa he
 "even though Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel do a great job of dealing with UPA coalition partners and maintaining its balance, Sibal has become a public figure fighting the crises and scandals that the UPA government is surrounded by
" sanyogvash upie ke pehle kaarykaal ke dauraan bharat-america parmaanu samajhaite ke samay sibbal pehali baar surkhiyon main aae the
 He was among the few cabinet ministers who actually read (and perhaps understood) the draft of the indo-us civil nuclear deal
 ve un chand logon main bhi shaamil the jinhone us samajhaite kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He has been a party spokesperson for the contested states since 1998 and has been interacting with the media in four general elections
 sibbal ne jab roj ek press vijyapti jari karke rajg par hamalaa bolnaa shuru kiya to unke ghar par yojit hone vaale press conference party mukhyalay 24 akbar road ke press conference se zyada lokahdhi ho gaye
 At the same time, he used phrases such as "textual and contextual", which were included in the dictionary of journalism
 unamem uksaane kii pravrit he or isaki vajah se ve kabhi-kabhi musiibat mol le lete hai
 While defending the indo-us nuclear deal, he was asked to reduce the attack against the Left as he was a partner of the UPA by that time
 haal main unhone 2ji spectrum aavanton main aisa jod-ghataav pesh kiya jisase laga ki koi ghotaalaa hi nahin hua he
 He immediately realized that there had been some misunderstanding and he immediately got himself out of the trouble
 party or sarkaar ke bheetar unke sahyogiyon ne, jo pehle hi unke utthan se irshyaa karte hai, is hisaab-kitaab ko samajhane kaa kaam sibbal par hi chhod diya
 Sibal says, "let me recount what i said in Parliament
" aap yaa to 'pehle aao-pehle paao' niti yaa phir nilaamee kii niti rakhte hai
 We had a 'first come first serve' policy since the NDA government
 lihaaja, agar 'pehle aao-pehle paao' kii niti thi to nilaamee kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 If the question of auction does not arise, then the question of loss also does not arise
 lihaaja, koi ghaataa nahin hua
 i did not say that if the spectrum was auctioned, it would not have paid
 maine yah kabhi nahin kaha
 "they accept that" my biggest challenge so far has been dealing with a lot of confusing issues regarding 2G spectrum
 vah yakeenan meri sabase mushkil chunauti rahi he or yah abhi khatm nahin hui he
 "he is one of the few ministers who has shown himself working in his ministry not only during his various press conferences but beyond the eyes of the media
" unhone upie ke duusare kaarykaal main uskaa sabase mahatvapurn kanoon 'shiksha kaa adhikaar vidheyak' diya he
 He has created many critics due to his desire to do all the work alone
 unhone apane sahyogiyon se raay-mashvira kiye bagaiyr 10veen class kii board pariksha khatm karne ke prastaav kaa elaan kar diya
 "this issue was not to be brought before the cabinet," he says
 is maamle kii nigaraanee ke liye 1994 se gathit har samiti ne isaki sifarish kii thi
 But no one was ready to implement it
 maine sirf itnaa hi kiya ki un siforeeshon ko lagu kar diya
 i took this risk
 '' phir ve kehete hai, ''lekin jab tak aap faisla karke unhen lagu nahin karenge tab tak jindagi main koi badlaav nahin aa saktaa
 "now his agenda includes reforming the Department of Posts
 ve kehete hai, ''main dak vibhaag main kranti laane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 It is not in the headlines because it is not an attractive department
 '' phir ve apana janaa-pahachaanaa muskaan bikherte hai, maano unke paas saare jawaab maujuud hon
 "I believe that every ministry is very exciting because there is a lot to do
" romaanch bahut nijee bhaavana he, or yah aapke kaam se hi mahasoos hota he
 The idea is to create excitement with your work and make it contagious
 '' ve vibhinn mantralayon main apane anubhav ke bare main bataate hai, ''vigyaan or praudyogiki mantralay main dimag lagane kii jarurat thi lekin vah behad romaanchak tha
 He was concerned with ideas, from the future
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas multah aisa mantralay he jo aapako aaj kii hakeekat samajhne ke liye baadhya karata he, jabaki doorsanchaar mantralay hakeekat or bhavishya ke bich kii kadi he
 i look at these three in a similar way
 ''vigyaan evam hnaudyogiki mantri kii haisiyat se sibbal 2005 main shunya se bhi kam taapmaana vaale antarctic par jane vaale pehle saansad ban gaye
 But by returning to the country, they were able to thrive in the political atmosphere
 janvari ke mantrimandal pherbadal ke dauraan maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay par najar tikaane vaale kai congressi maayoos ho gaye or sibbal ko maanav sansaadhan vikaas ke saath hi doorsanchaar mantralay bhi mil gaya
 Now Manmohan Singh is planning a reshuffle once again and no one knows what Sibal is going to get
 unhen bhi pataa nahin he lekin ek baat tay he
 They will enjoy their work wherever they go

 The reign of the prince's coronation after the king's passing in any princely state is old
 lekin agar isi rajtilak ke liye kisi rajkumaar ko baqayada court se zamaanat lekar apane hi rajmahal main haazir hona pade, to ise aap kya kahenge?ye kahani he aise hi ek rajkumaar kii
 Who got the throne as well as his kingdom
 jaanate hai isaki vajah kya thi? darasal rajkumaar apane sir par qatl kaa ilzaam liye teen maheene se faraar tha or tajposhi faraari main ho nahin sakati thi
 This is such a strange story about the death of a king and the crown prince
 jaisaa isse pehle naa to kabhi kisi ne suna or naa hi shaayad aage kisi ko sunne ko mili
 How did the cycle of bail in the royalty come? Because before the death of a king here, the prince reaches the last time to meet his father by taking advance bail from the court
 bete ke aate hi pita aakiri saans lete hai
 And soon after the father leaves the world, the prince takes command of the princely state the next day
 lekin sawaal ye he ki akhir ek rajkumaar ko apane pita ko aakiri baar dekhne or raja ke taur par rajgaddi sanbhaalane ke liye agrim zamaanat kyon leni padati he? kyon baap ke bistar par pade hone ke baavjood ek betaa lagaataar police or kaanoon se bhaagta phirata he? or akhir kyon apane pita ke ankhen band karte hi rajkumaar apane sir par taj sajaa letaa he?to, ek rajkumaar kii faraari or is ajeeb rajtilak kaa puraa sach jaanane ke liye aapako teen maheene peeche lautnaa hoga
 The story of crime in the Dewas royal family of Madhya Pradesh began with a quarrel with some farmers on March 18, when Prince Vikram Singh, along with some of his warlords, reached the village Raghogarh, about 40 km from the palace
 yahaan zamin ke ek tukade par vikram singh daawa kar rahe the
 However, this land is occupied by some farmers of Raghogarh these days and they had cultivated wheat on it
 lekin bataate hai ki dal-bal ke saath vahaan pahunchate hi kunwar sahab ne gehun kii fasal kaat rahe lodhi parivaar par hamalaa kar diya
 And this attack turned into a bloody skirmish
 is hamale main pratap lodhi naam ke ek kisaan or uske ghar ke kai log zakhmi ho gaye, jabaki rajkumaar vikram singh kii taraf se bhi kuch log ghayal hue
 Rajkumar then escaped, after this, a case was also filed against each other, but Kunwar Sahab's trouble increased when the injured farmer Pratap Lodhi died in the hospital just two days after the clash
 ab rajkumaar ke khilaaf darj katl kii koshish kaa mukadmaa katl ke maamle main tarmeem kar diya gaya
 Police rage increased, but instead of handing himself over to the law, the prince escaped
 is silsile main ek-ek kar police ne rajkumaar ke 11 sipahasalaron ko giraftaar kar liya, lekin rajkumaar vikram singh the ki vaardaat ke baad se hi aise faraar hue ki phir kahin nazar hi nahin aae
 Or simply say that the police could not see them
 phir di agrim jamaanat kii arjihad to ye rahi ki maamle kii tafteesh puri ho gai
 And in this connection, charge sheet was also filed on 16 June, but the police did not find any information about these Rajkumar Sahab
 yahaan tak ki usne chargeshit main rajkumaar vikram singh ko faraar qaraar de diya
 But the case took a new turn when, exactly one day after the filing of the charge sheet, the prince or not, however, the lawyer of Rajkumar Vikram Singh appeared on the court by pleading for anticipatory bail in favor of his client and the accused in the law
 ji haa, usee rajkumaar kii agrim zamaanat kii fariyaad liye, jo apane sir par qatl jaise sangeen jurm kaa ilzaam lekar pichley teen maheenon se bhaagta phir rahaa tha
 Got 15 days bail
 Now, of course, when the case was awkward, a heated debate in the court was also over
 lihaaza, zamaanat kii fariyaad karte hue jahaan bachaav paksh ke vakeelon ne maanviya pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue zamaanat dene kii guzarish kii, vahiin sarkari vakil ne rajkumaar ko faraar mulzim bataate hue unke phir se bhaag jane kaa dar bataaya
 However, after hearing both the sides, the court accepted the plea of 15 days' advance surety in the name of the prince
 iske baad jo rajkumaar pichley teen maheene se police ko dhunde nahin mil rahe the, wo aspataal bhi pahunch gaye
 Also attended the funeral of the father and took the royalty after the coronation on the very next day of the father's death
 haalanki sutron kii maane to rajkumaar vikram singh ab tak police or kaanoon kii nazar main beshak faraar the, lekin haqiqat yahi he ki wo in dinon main zyaadaatar vakt devas ke apane mahal main rahe or indore ke us aspataal main bhi, jahaan unke pita, bijepi ke vidhayak or devas ke raja tukoji raav pavaar braim hamerej kii shikaayat ke baad ab tak bhartee the
 It means to say that the whole world saw Rajkumar Vikram Singh, but could not see the police and the rule
 is maamle main police kii bhoomika ko lekar sawaal isliye bhi he, kyonki rajkumaar se raja bane vikram singh koi aise shaks to the nahin ki unke bare main kisi ko koi suraag mil hi nahin saktaa tha
 That too on a day when police along with informers' net has the facility of technical surveillance and every person also uses mobile phone
 vaise bhi jin raja sahab ke guzarane ke baad unke antim sanskaar main soobe ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan, grih mantri babulal gaur, congress ke bade netaa digvijay singh jaise diggaj pahunche hon, us antim sanskaar main bagaiyr zamaanat ke unka betaa akhir kaise pahunchataa? lihaaza, bete ke liye to zamaanat hasil karnaa zaruri tha hi

 The Maharashtra government has petitioned the Supreme Court to clear the status by applying in the court
 supreme court is arji par agle hafte sunwaayee karegaa
 In fact, on July 29, the Bombay High Court had directed the Maharashtra government to seek clarification from the Supreme Court

 Also, the Bombay High Court in its order on 11 August 2014 had said that children below 18 years cannot participate in the construction of human pyramids in the Dahi Handi festival and the height of the pyramid cannot exceed 20 feet

 But there was no limit to the height of the pyramid
 yachika par koi vistrut sunwaayee nahin ho pai thi
 The festival of Dahi Handi is held every year on the occasion of Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna

 It is a very popular festival of Maharashtra
 har film kii tarah 'bajrangi bhaijan' kii shuruyaat main bhi nirmaataa-nirdeshak ne yah likhaa ki is kahani ke sabhi paatr or ghatnaayen kaalpanik hai
 But it is indeed a coincidence that a story and character similar to this is waiting for 'bhaijaan' in Pakistan
 film ke ek kirdaar 'munni' kii tarah hi karachi main mook badhir gita 14 saal se pakistan main he or bharat main uske parivaar ko talashne ke saare prayaas ab tak asafal rahe hai
 Punjab Rangers brought him to the Edi Foundation some 14 years ago
 sanghathan ke faisal edi ne yah jaankaree di
 Faisal said, 'over the years we have been trying to find out about his family or his city so that he can return
 is ladki ko pehle lahore sthit edi centre main laayaa gaya tha or baad main karachi sthit sanghathan ke ek aashray grih main bhej diya gaya
 Here, the philanthropic lady named Bilkis Edi, named Mother of Pakistan, named this girl Geeta and now she is very close to this girl
 'pahachaanaa bharat kaa nakshaagita ab 23 saal kii ho chuki he
 She is believed to have wandered as a child and entered the Pakistani border
 film main 'munni'ke kirdaar ne jahaan cricket match dekhakar ishaara kiya tha ki vah pakistan se he, vahiin gita ne mobile phone par bharat kaa nakshaa pahachaanaa
 However, she could not give any other information to Edi's employees
 vah pehle bhartiya nakshe par jharkhand par ungali rakhti he or phir telugana kii ore ishaara karte hue apane ghar kaa pataa bataane kii koshish karti he
 Seven brothers and four sisters are in the family
 With the gesture of fingers and gestures, Geeta told that she has seven brothers and four sisters
 faisal edi ne kaha, 'hamane uski likhi chijen logon ko dikhain, lekin kuch nateeja nahin niklaa
 She mimics Hindi words from magazines
 aashray grih ke karmchaariyon ne uske liye alag ek puja kaksh banaaya he, jisamen hindu devi-devataaon kii tasviren lagi hai
 Human rights activist and former minister Ansar Burney said, "she is a Hindu and has put colorful pictures of Hindu deities
" ' faisal ne bataaya, 'main uske liye nepal se ganesh kii murti laayaa tha
 After the success of Salman Khan-starrer 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', based on a similar fictional story, social activists are making efforts to reunite Geeta with her family in India
 teen saal pehle apane bharat daure ke samay gita kaa mudda uthaane vaale barney ne is ladki ke liye fasebuk abhiyaan chalaaya he
 The wedding will take place only after returning home, said Fasal, "last year, the staff of the Indian consulate came to him and took photographs and records, but they did not come back
 kai patrakaron ne, jisamen ek bhartiya bhi the, ne gita kaa saakshaatkaar bhi liya
 But no one could find out about his family
 sanghathan ke kaaryakartaaon ne gita ko manaaya ki vah pakistan main ek hindu ladke se shaadi karke nai jindagi kii shuruyaat kare
 She refused in her sign language and made it clear that she would marry only after returning home
 niti banane se jude jo faisle asanvaidhanik honge unhen khaarij karne kaa court ko puraa adhikaar he
 Former Supreme Court judge AK Ganguly, who gave the crucial verdict related to the cancellation of 122 licenses in the 2G scam, has said this
 justise ganguli loksabhaa ke purv spikar somnath chatarji ke us bayaan kaa jawaab de rahe the jisamen chatarji ne kaha tha ki court ne apane adhikaar se baahar jate hue ye faisla liya he
 He argues that the court cannot tamper with the decisions of the executive, arguing for the public interest
 justise ganguli ne kaha ki nyaayik samiksha samvidhan kii ek buniyadi visheshta he or is adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue court aise sabhi nitigat faislon ko radd kar saktaa he jo samvidhan ke mutabik naa liye gaye hon
 Justice Ganguly was responding to the statement of former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee in which Chatterjee said that the court has taken this decision by going out of its power
 unki daleel he ki court janhit kii daleel dete hue karypalika ke faislon ke saath chhedchhad nahin kar saktaa
 Justice Ganguly said that judicial review is a fundamental feature of the constitution and by exercising this right, the court can cancel all policy decisions which are not taken according to the constitution

 Abdul Kalam's remarks sparked a war of words between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in which he said that Sonia Gandhi never contested the post of Prime Minister in 2004
 congress kaa kahana he ki kalam kii tippanee se sabit he ki bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye sonia gandhi kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya tha, vahiin bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki sonia abhi bhi 'pradhanmantri se upar' hai
 Significantly, the BJP strongly opposed the appointment of Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister and Sushma Swaraj took a pledge that if Sonia became Prime Minister, she would turn her head
 kalam ke bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue bhaajapa ne kaha ki sonia aakhirkaar 'super prime ministar' hai
 BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, 'this is not a new thing
 kalam 'saab' pehle bhi yah baat kah chuke hai
 'he said,' but Kalam's statement does not make Sonia Gandhi 'mother India'
 vah abhi bhi super piem (pradhanmantri se upar) hai
 They have rights without accountability
 'duusari ore, congress ne yah kehete hue palatwaar kiya ki vah un sabaki sajeesh thi jo, sonia gandhi ko pradhanmantri ke rup main nahin chaahate the
 a Congress spokesperson said, "what Kalam said is a direct reference to the BJP which did not want Sonia to become the Prime Minister

 The central cabinet has taken a big decision to curb the Chit Fund (ponzi) scheme, amid a political battle between the Mamata Banerjee government of West Bengal and the Narendra Modi government at the center over the Saradha chit fund scam

 Giving information about the cabinet decision, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the most important thing in this is that any deposit scheme which is not regulated is illegal
 ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki ab koi bhi chit fund skim nahin chalaa sakegaa or aisa karne vaale kii sampatti bech kar logon kaa paisa waapas diya jayega
 He said that even if a person releases an advertisement of such a scheme under this bill, a big celebrity will be brand ambassador to attract people

 He said that from 2015 to 2018, CBI has registered a total of 166 cases in the case of Chint Fund
 isamen sabase zyada maamle pashchim bengal or odisha main saamne aae hai
 He said that the matter of West Bengal which is in discussion these days is before the BJP came to government

 These include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the governments of the state and union territories
 sabhi diposit teking skims ko sambandhit regulator ke paas register kiya jaataa he
 If a deposit is not registered with the regulators listed in the Taking Scheme Bill, it is considered unregulated
 ravishankar prasad ne bill ke bare main vistaar se bataate hue kaha ki is bill main teen prakaar ke aparaadhon or unki sajaa nihit he
 Under this, running unregulated deposit schemes (advertising, promoting and operating or taking funds for it) would be considered an offense

 report main kaha gaya ki fasebuk is ap ko yugers ke phone kaa root acces lene ke liye yuj kar rahaa he

 Oakeshott said both leaders find him effective and he is in a dilemma as to whom to support

 Windsor, on the other hand, said that he did not know what was going on in the minds of his two other independents

 Nitish Kumar also said that when there is an atmosphere of confrontation and intolerance in the country, it can be taken forward only with the idea of gandhi in it
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ne bijepi or sahyogi dalon dwaara kiye gaye bahishkaar par kaha ki kaarykram main aana yaa na aana un par nirbhar karata he, or unhen is baat se koi shikaayat nahin he

 rahul gandhi ne sawaal karte hue kaha, kya jaliyanvaala baag main sirf hindu yaa sirf sikh maare gaye the
 He said that only Hindustani were killed there, and all that Gandhiji did was to add all

 He said, it is written in every book, respect every person

 Nitish Kumar satirized BJP leaders and said that the program needed to be viewed from an ideological point of view and not from the party
 nitish kumaar ne yah bhi kaha ki jab desh main takaraav or ashishnutaa kaa vaataavaran bana hua he, usamen gandhi ke vichaar ko lekar hi aage badha ja saktaa he

 An audio tape of BJP MLA Sanjay Gupta from Chail seat in Kaushambi in UP has surfaced in which he is heard saying that 90 percent of the electricity theft is done by Muslims
 soshal media par viral ho rahe is audio main sanjay gupta bijli vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko kathith taur par dhamkee dete bhi sune ja sakate hai
 Listening to the audio, it appears that he was angry at the action of the power officials against some close people in his home town of Bharwari and started violently harassing Executive Engineer Avinash Singh over the phone
 audio ke shuru main adhishasi abhiyantaa avinaash kii aawaaj sunai detii he
 In which he says- 'dr
 om prakaash ke aspataal ke khilaaf koi ection nahin liya he uskaa bas meter badalawa diya gaya he
 Then the Vigilante Gupta asks, against whom FIR has been filed, Avinash is said to have filed an FIR against Narendra Kumar
 phir vidhayak poochhate hai ki narendra kumaar koun he? avinaash jawaab dete hai ki wo dow omprakash ke bhai hai or jo wo meter istemaal kar rahe the, usamen cabel nahin judaa tha, ve diarect istemaal kar rahe the
 In the audio, the MLA then strikes the Executive Engineer that only corrective action should be taken to increase revenue, not repressive
 phir bijli vibhaag or iske adhikariyon ke liye abhadra shabd kaa istemaal karte hue anjaam bhugatne kii dhamkee bhi dete hai
 In the audio, the MLA can also be heard saying to the engineer, "have you ever been to a Muslim colony, first go to a Muslim colony
 Right now, they steal 90 percent of their electricity
" pehle jaakar check kiijie
 This is not the calm of the MLA
 ve audio main kehete sunai dete hai ki ‘keval hinduon ko pratadit kiya ja rahaa he, main is par lakhanu jaakar baat karuunga
 The MLA also told the engineer that the complete data of how many firs were lodged against people belonging to particular communities should be made available immediately
 guuruuvaar ko sanjay gupta bijli vibhaag ke daftar ke get par data lene ke liye bhi pahunch gaye to bijli karmchaaree bhi unke khilaaf lamaband ho gaye
 In the audio of the time, Sanjay Gupta himself is heard saying that he is coming from Rameswaram, and he is getting a lot of calls from the area about people's power department, which disrupted his journey
 vidhayak sanjay gupta se jab is sambandh main sampark kiya to unhone kaha ki bijli vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne vasuuli kaa dhandha bana liya he
 In this context, he named two engineers of the electricity department - Tariq Jameel and Avinash Singh
 sanjay gupta ne aarope lagaaya ki ye adhikari bijli chori ke khilaaf karrwai ke naam par deal karte hai, agar paisa mil jaataa he to chhod diya jaataa he varanaa exiaar darj kara di jaati he
 Sanjay Gupta also alleged that he is getting money from people of a particular religion, so action is not taken against him
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki sanjay gupta ne dhamkaate hue kaha ki jinke gharon kii bijli kaati gai he or jinke upar FIR karai gai he, vahaan bijli behaal kii jaae, saath hi exiaar bhi waapas lee jaae
 Please tell that these days the campaign of electricity department is going on against illegal electricity in UP
 ek khaas vakt tak mohalat dene ke baad yogi sarkaar tamaam avaidh conection ko na sirf kaat rahi he balki jurmaana bhi vasuul rahi he
 firs are also being filed
 sirf hinduon kii nahin balki kai muslim bahul ilaakon main bhi aise abhiyaan chalaae gaye hai
 In many districts of western Uttar Pradesh, illegal electricity connections and cut-off homes of many Muslims have been cut
 kai jagah FIR bhi darj hui hai
 However, MLA Sanjay Gupta does not regret his saying even after the objectionable video surfaced
 ulte vah apni baat par ade hai ki bijli vibhaag ke kuch log sirf hinduon ko hi pratadit karte hai jabaki ek samudaay vishesh ke logon par karrwai nahin karte
 According to the MLA, this is the thinking of the people of his area
 vidhayak ne aarope lagaaya ki unka or sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye bijli vibhaag ke ye ejeeniyar aisa kar rahe hai
 The allegations of MLA Sanjay Gupta were dismissed by Executive Engineer Avinash Singh
 avinaash ne khud ko vidhayak kii dhamkee se aahat bataaya or saath hi is kshetra se tabadale kii ichha bhi jataai
 He said that action is being taken against the illegal connection of electricity on the orders of the government
 aise hi kuch logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii gai to vidhayak se sampark kar dabaav daalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 MLA Gupta, who is considered close to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, reached the gate of the office of the electricity department on Thursday and started asking for the data of action there
 vidhayak ke bartaav or vibhaag ke afasaron ko di gai dhamkee ke virodh main bijli vibhaag ke karmchaaree dharne par baithkar narebaaji karne lage
 Power employees say that if any action is taken against them, they will go on mass leave

 In the midst of all the protests and demands, the Siddaramaiah government of Karnataka finally decided to hand over the case of IAS DK Raviki's death to the CBI
 somvaar ko is ore centre se sifarish ke baad pradesh sarkaar ne hai court main ab tak kii jaanch report saunp di he
 It includes post mortem report as well as statement of batchmate of IAS
 report main sarkaar ne saaf kiya he ki ravi or uski mahila bachmet ke bich aam dosti se badhkar 'sambandh' the or isamen vittiya lenden bhi shaamil he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier the court had prohibited the Siddaramaiah government from presenting this report in the House
 sarkaar kii ore se siaidi kii report ko band lipaphe main edwocket general pro
 Ravi Varma Kumar submitted to the court
 ravi kii mahila bachmet rohinee sindhuri ke pati sudhir reddy ne is babat ek rit yachika daakhil kii thi, jiske tahat yah report pesh kii gai
 In the case, Sudhir had taken an interim order from the court, after which the production of report in the assembly was stayed
 sarkaar ne apni ore se hai court se apil kii ki use sadan main report pesh kii ijaajat di jaae
 The government argued that Ravi's batchmate's death is a key link in the case
 edwocket general ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne report main mahila adhikari kaa naam nahin liya he or ise privesi kaa maamla mana he
 The government has written in the report that Ravi wanted to advance his relationship with the female batchmate by friendship
 edwocket general kumaar ne court main ravi kii kol detail or massej kaa bhi zikr kiya, jisamen maut ke din mahila ke phone par ravi ne 44 baar phone kiya tha
 Referring to the post-mortem report, he said that three doctors have confirmed after investigation that Ravi died of hanging
 kumaar ne kaha ki sarkaar ko sadan main report pesh karne kaa adhikaar diya jaae, kyonki is ore roak se sarkaar media dwaara lagaae ja rahe aaropon par safai nahin de paa rahi he
 Kumar said, 'the ban on presenting the report has tied the hands of the government
 'gauratlab he ki isse pehle is babat mahila bachmet ne bhi jaanch adhikari ko bataaya tha ki ravi usase baar-baar pati ko chhodane kii baat karata tha
 The female batchmate has also accused Ravi of mental abuse
 sarkaar ne shiksha vyavastha ko badnaam kar diya he
 Are you wishing that the Constitution be amended for Anil Yadav? The case is not just about the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission
 madhyamik shiksha seva chayan board or ucchtar seva shiksha chayan board ke adhyaksh pad ke liye bhi sarkaar ko ek yogya vyakti nahin mil rahaa he

 a bench of Chandrachud and Justice Yashwant Sinha made sarcastic remarks during the hearing of a petition related to the appointment of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission chairman Anil Yadav
 yah tippanee us pradesh ke bare main kii gai, jahaan aadhikarik sutron ke mutabik, gram sevika aashaa se lekar samooh “ga” tak ke paanch lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 Over one lakh posts are vacant in inter colleges
 in collejon main pradhanacharya ke 70 fisadi pad khaali hai or hiskulon kaa haal yah he ki kai jilon main ek hi headmaster chaar-chaar skulon kaa prabhaar sambhaal rahaa he
 40 per cent of the posts in the urban bodies are vacant and one executive officer (EO) has the responsibility of five municipalities
 lekin sarkaar teen saal main bhartee board kaa gathan hi nahin kar pai
 When the Akhilesh Yadav government, which won elections on the basis of promises like unemployment allowance, comes out to give employment through trying to fill the remaining positions, its intentions come under suspicion
 nateeja yah hota he ki hycourt yaa supreme court se niyuktiyon par roak lag jaati he
 Look, the case of recruitment of more than 70,000 primary teachers started in 2011 is stuck in the Supreme Court
 pisies-2011 main dhaandhlee kaa maamla sabase pehle india today ne “pisies-2011 main yadavaraj” sheershak se june 2014 main prakashit khabar se uthaaya tha or ab isi ko lekar ayog hycourt se fatkaar kha rahaa he
 On 7 August 2015, the High Court stayed the distribution of appointment letters in the recruitment of 4,000 constables in 2011
 adaalat main bhartiyon ko chunauti de rahi chaatr sangharsh samiti ke samanvayak avanish pandeya kehete hai, “yani 20 karod kii aabaadi vaale pradesh main karodon berozegaron kii puri peedi sarkari naukari kii taiyaari or kamyaabi ke intjaar main overej hoti ja rahi he or akhilesh sarkaar bhrashtachariyon ko sangrakshan dene main juty he
 "he is also concerned, because last month, the Allahabad High Court banned the work of Anita Yadav, Chairman of the Secondary Education Services Selection Board and Ramveer Singh Yadav, Chairman of the Higher Education Services Selection Board
 baad main donon jagah nae adhyaksh aanan-fanan main niyukt karne pade
 At the same time, after seeing the file of the appointment of the UPPSC President, the High Court asked what qualification was there in Anil Yadav who bypassed the remaining 82 claimants and made him sit on this post? Not only this, the DM of Mainpuri within a day, that too on Sunday, Lekhpal, Tehsildar, SDM took the most report and gave him a character certificate
 hycourt ne sarkaar se poocha he ki adhyaksh kii niyukti kii koi prakriya uske paas he bhi yaa nahin? pradesh ke itihaas main yah pehla sharmnaak sanyog he jab sarkari naukariyaan dene vaale teen pramukh aayogon ke adhyaksh ko lekar hycourt ne itnaa sakht rukh apanaaya ho
 Retired IAS officer of Uttar Pradesh Badal Chatterjee asks, “in such cases DM asks for report through SP
 yahaan to espi ko poocha hi nahin gaya
 Something is fishy

 In the Vyapam scam, questions are arising on the fact that the examinations conducted for the recruitment of medical seats and government jobs have been rigged, but in Uttar Pradesh successive government recruitments are stuck in the High Court and the Supreme Court, because or So they have been accused of rigging the entrance examination or in the name of direct recruitment, without the examination, the people in the government job have been left without bail Went reported
 vaise bhi vyapam main maamla chote str kii naukariyon main dhaandhlee kaa he, jabaki yahaan teen pramukh ayog or anya tarah kii sheersh sarkari naukariyon main dhaandhlee ke sidhe aarope hai
 After these allegations, there was an attempt to make the process transparent, but Uttar Pradesh is going in the opposite direction
 pisies-2011 main bhartee main dhaandhlee kaa aarope lagane ke baad ayog ne pehla kaam yah kiya ki pisies main safal ummidavaaron ke naam saarvajanik karnaa hi band kar diya
 On the one hand, the whole country can know one thing about the four topper girls in the Union Public Service Commission, but if the topper of PCS does not tell himself, no one can even know his name
 jab chaatro ne aarope lagaae ki mukhya pariksha kii kaapiyon main number galat dhang se die ja rahe hai to ayog ne saal bhar ke andar mukhya pariksha kii kapiyaan jalaane kaa intjaam kar diya
 Keep in mind that in order to protect the scam, arrangements were made to burn copies in Madhya Pradesh within three months
 haal yah he ki kisi ko nahin pataa ki pisies-2012 kii kapiyaan abhi hai yaa nasht ho chuki hai
 In response to an RTI, the commission said that the copies have been destroyed, while on another RTI said that students can come and see their copy
 india today ne jab ayog ke sachiv rigwan ur rahamaan se poocha ki pisies-2012 kii kapiyaan kii sthiti kya he, to unhone kaha, “is bare main mujhe koi jaankaree nahin he
