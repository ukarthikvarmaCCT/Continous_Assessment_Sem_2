 MLA from Laxminagar seat Vinod Kumar Binny has opened a front against his own party on the ticket of Aam Aadmi Party
 binni somvaar se apni hi party ke khilaaf anshan par baith gaye hai
 However, on Sunday night, AAP has shown Binny the way out of the party
 dilli main pehali baar sarkaar banane vaali 'aap' ke khilaaf binni ke bagawati sur pehle bhi dikhe
 But at that time, Arvind Kejriwal somehow managed to overcome the fire of revolt within the party
 39 saal ke binni anshan par baithne se pehle alji najeeb jang se mili
 After meeting LG, he said, 'I will sit on the dharna and fight for the issues of the people of Delhi
 binni ke mutabik unhone alji se somnath bharti ke mudde par baat kii
 On the issue of molestation of women, LG said that the law will be strict for all
 dilli main pichley kuch dinon se jo kuch ho rahaa he, us par karrwai karne kaa bharosa alji ne diya he
 However, Binny also said that the advice given by LG to him will be disclosed from the stage of fast

 He said, Arvind Kejriwal's priority is not to run the government because he does not want to work
 main unhen jimmedaari se bhaagane nahin duungaa
 Kejriwal responded to Binny saying that no government did as much work as this government did in a month
 kejariwal ne binni ke aaropon ko nakaarte hue kaha ki unhen sarkaar bachaane kii raajnneeti nahin kerani he
 Binny, who was earlier in the Congress, called Kejriwal a dictator and alleged that the party is betraying the people of Delhi by going back on its election promises
 binni ne kaha ki dilli main 'aap' kii sarkaar banane ke baad na to bijli bill maaf hue hai, na hi daam kam hue hai
 Binny had announced that if AAP does not fulfill the promises made to the public by January 27, then it will stage a sit-in at Jantar Mantar
 haalanki, kejariwal or party kaa kahana he ki binni loksabhaa chunaav ke liye tikat nahin milane se naaraaz hai
 Even before this, Binny's rebellious attitude was seen
 bataaya gaya ki binni dilli sarkaar main mantri kaa pad nahin milane se naaraaz the
 AAP senior leaders Sanjay Singh and Kumar Vishwas went to his house to celebrate Binny
 haalanki, binni kaa kahana he ki party unhen bina maange mantri pad de rahi thi, unhone khud pad lene se inkaar kiya tha

 The Supreme Court had asked the central government how the court order could be enforced against Mallya
 centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki maalya ko waapas laane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, SBI had told the Supreme Court that Mallya owes Rs 9200 crore
 baikon ne kaha- maalya kii yachika par sunwaayee nahin honi chahie, kyonki vah baar-baar court ke aadesh kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Vijay Mallya had said in the court that he does not have enough money to pay the bank loan of Rs 9200 crore, as all his assets have already been confiscated
 vijay maalya ne supreme court main kaha unke paas jo bhi sampatti he vah jabt kii ja chuki he
 Now they have no money
 vijay maalya ne kaha ki jo 2000 karod kii unki sampatti ko bank ne jabt kii he, bank chaahe to use bech saktaa he
 The Supreme Court was hearing a petition filed by banks against Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya
 sunwaayee main bainkon ne supreme court se maang kii thi or kaha tha ki court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ko aadesh de ki vah diego deal se mili 40 million yues dollar ko ek hafte ke bheetar use bharat lekar aae

 Banco had demanded the submission of US $ 40 million from the Diego deal to the Supreme Court
 isse pehle vijay maalya kii yachika par court ne bainko ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 In the petition, Mallya demanded the withdrawal of the contempt notice
 maalya kaa kahana he ki sampatti kaa byoraa samjhaute ke liye diya tha jabaki samjhauta nahin ho rahaa he
 So there is no contempt case
 darasal, supreme court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ke khilaaf adaalat kii avmaananaa ke maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 SBI and banks have filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court, on which the court issued a notice to Mallya asking why not be tried for contempt against him? bainkon kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ke aadesh par maalya ne sil cover main sampatti kaa byoraa diya, vah galat he
 The AG told the court that Mallya hid many information, lied in this declaration
 maalya ne 2500 crores ke cash kaa len dein bhi chipaaya he jo court ke aadesh kii avmaananaa he
 Actually, on the court's order, Mallya had filed the details of his property overseas
 isse pehle bainkon kaa kareeb 9000 karod rupee lone naa chukaane ke maamle main court ne maalya ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga tha
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court had asked Mallya whether the information you had given about your properties in the court is correct or not? Have you violated the order of Karnataka High Court? Because the Karnataka High Court had said in its order that Mallya cannot do any transaction without the permission of the court
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki maalya ke khilaaf court ke aadesh ko kaise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government told the Supreme Court that efforts were being made to bring back Mallya
 vahiin SBI ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki maalya ke upar 9200 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Banks said - Mallya's petition should not be heard, because he is repeatedly violating the court order
 vijay maalya ne court main kaha tha ki unke paas itane paise nahin he ki ve 9200 karod rupee bank ke karz ko adaa kar paaen, kyonki unki sabhi sampatiyon ko pehle hi jabt kar liya gaya he
 Vijay Mallya said in the Supreme Court that whatever property he had was confiscated
 ab unke paas paise nahin hai
 Vijay Mallya said that the bank which has seized his assets worth Rs 2000 crore, the bank can sell it if he wants
 supreme court kingfisher airlines ke mukhiya vijay maalya ke khilaaf bainkon kii daayar yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa tha
 At the hearing, banks had demanded from the Supreme Court and asked the court to order King Miffler Airlines chief Vijay Mallya to bring US $ 40 million from the Diego deal to India within a week
 agar vah paise ko waapas bharat nahin laate to vyaktigat taur par court main pesh hon
 The comments bainkon ne supreme court ko bataaya ki diego deal se mili 40 million dollar ko bacchon ke acount main transfar kiya he or uskaa ek trust bana rakhaa he
 SBI and other banks demanded the Supreme Court and said that Mallya had violated the order of the Karnataka High Court to transfer $ 40 million received from the Diego deal to the children's account
 bainko ne diego deal se mili 40 million america dollar ko supreme court main jamaa karaane kii maang kii thi
 Earlier, on the petition of Vijay Mallya, the court issued notice to the banks and sought reply
 yachika main maalya ne avmaananaa notice ko waapas lene kii maang kii thi
 Mallya says that the details of the property were given for settlement, while the agreement is not being done
 lihaaja koi avmaananaa kaa maamla nahin banataa
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a contempt of court case against Vijay Mallya, the head of Kingfisher Airlines
 SBI or bainkon ne supreme court main adaalat kii avmaananaa kii yachika daakhil kii he jis par court ne maalya ko notice jari kar poocha tha ki kyon naa unke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae ? The petition of the banks stated that on the order of the Supreme Court, Mallya gave the details of the property in the seal cover, it is wrong
 AG ne court ko kaha ki maalya ne is diclaration main kai jaankariyaan chhipaai, jhooth bolaa he
 Mallya has also hidden a cash transaction of 2500 crores which is a contempt of court order
 darasal court ke aadesh par maalya ne desh videshi apni sampatti kaa byoraa daakhil kiya tha
 Earlier, in the case of banks not repaying the loan of about Rs 9000 crore, the court issued notice to Mallya and sought the answer
 vijay maalya ne supreme court main kaha unke paas jo bhi sampatti he vah jabt kii ja chuki he

 a spokesman for the Home Ministry says that some media reports are saying that the Home Ministry has proposed to implement Article 371 in Jammu and Kashmir
 aisi khabaren galat or niraadhaar hai
 Actually, it was being claimed that Article 370 would be removed as soon as the Central Government abolished Article 370, a special provision made for Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki grih mantri amit shah kai baar aise daavon ko khaarij kar chuke hai
 The Home Minister has also said in the Lok Sabha that this article will not be deleted
 Certain media reports stating that Ministry of Home Affairs has moved a proposal to implement Article 371 in Jammu & Kashmir are incorrect and baseless
 @ hmoindia @ pib_india @ ddnewslive @ airnewsalerts @ diprjk — Spokesperson, Ministry of Home Affairs (@pibhomeaffairs) December 14, 2019 Earlier in Parliament when Article 371 was also raised on 6 August during debate on 370, Home Minister Amit during debate Shah had made several arguments as to why the government did not want to remove this article
 amit shah ne ek tark diya tha ki370 kii tarah anuchhed 371 rajyon main algaavvaad ko badhaava nahin detaa
 Amit Shah had also argued that under 371A, the assembly of Nagaland decides for the ownership of religious, social practices, land and resources etc
 of Nagas
 yah anuchhed desh kiekta or akhandtaki raah main baadhak nahin he
 According to Amit Shah, comparing 370 and 371 means misleading the country
 kya he anuchhed 371?purvottar sahit desh ke kareeb 11 rajyon main anuchhed 371 ke vibhinn praavdhaan lagu he
 Due to this article, the central government can work related to development, security, protection etc
 in the respective states
 yah anuchhed sambandhit rajyon ko vishesh darja jaisi vyavastha detaa he
 The Governor of both the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat has the exclusive right under Article 371 to form separate development boards of Vidarbha, Marathwada in Maharashtra and Saurashtra and Kutch in Gujarat

 jab baat virginity ko tyaagane kii aati he to zyaadaatar mahilaayein sahi insaan kaa intjaar karti hai, jabaki kuch sahi daam kaa
 Yes, Elizabeth René, a US medical student, has decided to auction her virginity
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle brazil kii ek 21 varshiya student katrina migliorini ne bhi apni virginity kii nilaamee kaa elaan kiya tha
 27-year-old Elizabeth will sell her virginity through the internet and she hopes that she will earn at least 2 crore 43 lakh 84 thousand rupees from it
 rene ke mutabik, 'virginity kii nilaamee kaa pramukh makasad paise kamanaa he
 i neither had nor had any emotional attachment to my virginity
 isliye mere liye aisa karnaa bada aasaan he
 And why should i not do this? This is a powerful and easy way to earn money '
 rene is baat ko samajhati hai ki kuch mahilaon ke liye virginity khona jindagi kaa ek mahatvapurn pal hota he, lekin unke liye to yah sirf shaareerik badlaav or bijness se zyada kuch nahin hai
 Rene says, 'sex is just sex'
 rene ne kabhi bhi sex nahin kiya he
 He has never seen anyone in a nude stage, nor has he seen any nude man
 unke mutabik, 'maine ladakon se date kii he, lekin do yaa teen maheenon se zyada nahin
 i have never had a boyfriend because i have not met anyone who has convinced me that sex is more than physical exercise
 mujhe ladke pasand hai, lekin kisi ke saath bhi meraa imotional conection nahin rahaa
 i study and work on projects
 mujhe doston ke saath ghoomana-phirana pasand he or yahi mere liye kaaphi he'
 René's friends support this decision, but his brother does not like it
 rene ke mutabik, 'mere dost mere faisle kaa sammaan karte hai
 He trusts me, but my brother has objections
 haalanki isse hamaare rishte par koi fark nahin padaa
 He knows that i am smart and he is confident that i will be able to do it all right '
 yahi nahin rene ke mata-pita bhi unke saath hai
 René also has a blog in which people ask him a variety of questions
 jaise 'kya yah veshyavriti nahin he'? 'aisi ladki kis tarah kii doctor hogi'? 'kya virgin veshya nariwadi ho sakati he'? baharhaal, yah nilaamee rene kii website www
 elizabeth-raine
 com par 1 april se shuru hogi
 Since prostitution is illegal in the US, Rene has found an agent in Australia who will help them in the auction
 aapako bataa den ki australia main veshyavriti sambandhi kanoonee zyada lacheele hai
 Rene says that the auction will be entirely according to the law
 ve nilaamee se mili paison par tex bhi adaa karengi or kamai kaa 35 fisadi hissaa charity ko daan main de dengi
 René is a medical student in the United States, but he has not revealed which college he is studying
 unke blog main unhone apni jo tasviren aplod kii hai usamen unka cheharaa chipa hua he
 René says that whoever wins at the auction will meet with them to spend 12 hours in a luxurious hotel
 is dauraan unke gharavaalon ko pataa hoga ki wo kahaan hai
 He says that if anyone feels that i will fall in love with him after paying money for sex, he will be very disappointed
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe acchhee tarah pataa he ki yah kya he or isse main bhaavnaatmak rup se prabhavit nahin ho paaungi
 It is nothing more than one night stand '

 com / w1lf2hx1ma For a long time, the road to the throne of Delhi has been passing through Bihar through Uttar Pradesh in the Hindi belt
 1962 tak desh ke raashtrapati bihar se the
 So far, 8 out of 14 Prime Ministers were elected from Uttar Pradesh and in 67 years after independence they ruled the country for more than 47 and a half years
 is baar bhi rahul gandhi or narendra modi se lekar arvind kejariwal or mulaayam singh yadav uttar pradesh se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Mayawati is already in the Rajya Sabha from this state
 aise main is baat kii prabal sambhaavna he ki aglaa pradhanmantri phir isi rajya se bane
 Now, who will be made in them, we will be able to know only in the second fortnight of May
 sabhi rajyon main dekhen to uttar pradesh or bihar do aise rajya hai, jo loksabhaa main kul 543 main kramshah 80 or 40 saansad bhejte hai
 That is, only one-fifth of the total mps come from these two states
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main bijepi ko uttar pradesh main kul das siten mili thim or bihar main 12
 If the bjp-led NDA in Delhi is to realize its dream of getting more than 272 seats to form a government, it will have to improve its performance in these states
 donon rajyon kii kul 120 siton main se 22 ke apane aankade main use acha-khaasaa ijapha karnaa hoga
 The NDA is not expected to get more seats in large states in the eastern and southern parts of the country like West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Kerala
 isiilie hindipattee kii jang hi mote taur par yah tay karegi ki may 2014 ke madhya main desh kaa pradhanmantri koun banegaa
 According to the India Today group-cicero Opinion poll, the BJP is projected to get 46 (H4) seats in Uttar Pradesh while it is likely to get 22 (H2) seats with NDA allies in Bihar
 iske mutabik, congress ko uttar pradesh main 8 (h 2)or bihar main upie sahyogiyon ke saath 17(h 2) siten jeetne kaa anumaan he
 The survey was conducted between March 29 and April 4 in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh with 1,800 and 3,600 people respectively
 donon hi rajyon main upie sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se baari mohabhang dekhne ko mila he or baaki partiyon ke netaaon se bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii baari badhat ke saajha sanket mili hai
 About half of the voters in Uttar Pradesh and three out of every five in Bihar are unhappy with the functioning of the current government
 ye donon hi rajya 1984 tak congress ke garh hua karte the
 That year the party unexpectedly won 83 seats out of a total of 85 seats in undivided Uttar Pradesh
 isi tarah avibhajit bihar main use kul 54 main 48 siton par vijay hasil hui thi
 In both, more than half of the votes went to the Congress account
 lekin 1998 tak aate-aate congress bihar or uttar pradesh main apni chhavi kii chaaya maatr banakar rah gai
 In 1998, the Congress got only around 6-7 percent of the votes in both states
 uttar pradesh main to use ek bhi seat hasil na hui or bihar main bhi uski sankhya bas paanch tak hi pahunch pai
 Between 1984 and 1998, the dominance of the Congress on the one hand was broken and on the other, the BJP started strengthening
 1998 main use uttar pradesh main 57 siten (uttarakhand ke banane ke pehle)or bihar main 20 siten (jharkhand banane se pehle) hasil huin
 Its vote percentage increased to 36 in Uttar Pradesh
 5 or bihar main 24 ho gaya
 Now, according to the India Today group-cicero Opinion Poll, an additional trend of around 17 per cent in its favor (with allies) in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is expected to reach the bjp's tally in both states
 uttar pradesh or bihar main congress se khaali hui chunavi jameen kaa bada hissaa kshetreey partiyon ko bhi mila
 For example, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led by Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar, the Janata Dal (united) led by Nitish Kumar and the Samajwadi Party (SP) of Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Mayawati
 Benefited from iske alaava up-kshetreey janaadhar vaali partiyaan bhi ubharin
 For example, Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal in Upper Doab region of Uttar Pradesh and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party in parts of Bihar
 maujuuda surveykshan main in kshetreey partiyon ke janaadhar main bhi bade badlaav kaa anumaan he
 Uttar Pradesh: In the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, two major parties SP and BSP got a major share in the vote
 bhartiya chunaavon main kshetravaad kaa daur shuru hua to uttar pradesh main lagbhag dedh dashak se inhen donon partiyon kaa dabadabaa he
 This was a big event as the BSP became a registered party in the state in 1991 and the SP broke from the Janata Dal in 1992
 opinian pole ke anumaan ke mutabik, bijepi uttar pradesh main sapa or bispi ke janaadhar main bade paimaane par send laga sakati he
 Here bjp's share in votes can go up from 18 percent in 2009 to 35 percent
 duusari ore, congress ke vot pratishat main giravat kaa anumaan he lekin yah sirf 4
 5 percent can be reduced to 17 percent
 bispi kii vot hissedari main bhi 9 pratishat tak giravat aa sakati he or 1996 ke baad congress se kaaphi aage nikal gai bispi ab vot pratishat or siton donon hi maamalon main lagbhag congress ke kareeb tik sakati he
 In this way, the BSP is projected to get only 11 seats, which is much less than the 20 seats it got in 2009
 duusari ore, sapa ko 2009 kii 23 siton ke mukaable is baar 18 siten hi mil sakati hai
 The BSP may see a decline in the mass base of both caste and religion categories, while the BJP appears to have strengthened the base of its Brahmins, Rajputs and other upper castes
 usne kurmi, koiri or jatav jaisi pichhadi tathaa dalit jatiyon main bhi apana samarthan badhaayaa he
 The RLD has always been in alliances since 2004
 2004 main usne sapa se haath milaayaa tha to 2009 main bijepi se lekin baad main vah usee party ke saath gathjod main shaamil ho gaya, jiske khilaaf chunaav ladaa tha
 In 2009 RLD won five seats mainly from Upper Doab
 is baar ke chunaav main uskaa gathjod congress ke saath he or uski sambhaavnaaen bahut ujali to nahin hi lag rahi hai
 The geographical area of uttar Pradesh is larger than about 150 countries in the world and even in terms of population, only five countries are larger than that
 yahaan solahavin loksabhaa ke liye kareeb 13
 4 crore voters will cast their votes in 1,40,259 polling stations in six phases from 10 April to 12 May
 uttar pradesh main 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik, muslim aabaadi 18
 5 percent and after the august-september 2013 riots in Muzaffarnagar, the electoral landscape has become increasingly complicated
 is vajah se dharmik aadhaar par pahchaan kii raajnneeti par jor or ranneetik voting kii sambhaavnaaen jataai ja rahi hai
 SP and BSP, both effective regional parties of Bihar Uttar Pradesh, supported the UPA government from outside but cleverly refused to form a pre-poll alliance with Congress or BJP in the state
 lekin chunaav purv gathjod ke maamle main bihar ke do kshetreey mahaarathiyon argedy or jedy (you) kaa ravaiya kuch alag kism kaa rahaa he
 RJD had pre-poll alliances with Congress in 2004 and with LJP in 2009
 jedy (you) kaa bhi 2004 or 2009 main bijepi ke saath chunaav purv gathjod rahaa he
 The electoral landscape of Bihar was tempered by three important events
 ek to yahi ki argedy ke netaa lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale main sajaa ho gai
 When he was out on bail, he was deprived of contesting elections
 unhone congress or sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party se siton kaa talmail kiya
 Secondly, the JD (U) broke a decade-long alliance with the BJP and has been struggling alone in the field, apart from aligning with the CPI
 tisare, bijepi ne algepi or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) ke saath siton kaa talmail kar liya
 According to the India Today group-cicero opinion poll, the BJP and Congress are going to get a big benefit from the tally of seats in Bihar
 2014 main endie ke ghatak dalon kaa vot lagbhag doguna hokar 38 pratishat tak pahunch saktaa he or unank 22 siten mil sakati hai
 The vote of the Congress and its ally RJD may fall by 6 percent, but due to the vote of both, the seats of the UPA constituent parties may increase from 6 to 17 (H2)
 ek vajah he congress ke oonchi jatiyon ke janaadhar kaa argedy ke pichhadaa janaadhar se milanaa
 The JD (U) may have to lose one-fourth of its votes and may have to settle for 1 (H1) seat
 yah is tathy ke baavjood he ki nitish kumaar vahaan abhi tak ke sabase lokapriy mukhyamantri hai

 Despite the undeveloped magic of Premchand's storytelling remains readable today with the help of sympathetic connections, expression of human emotions and storytelling, we must accept that elements like simple and sensitive storytelling are necessary for their long-term survival

 The story of Madan Mohan's new collection 'patal Pani' seems to compensate for this loss in this era of today's story, which makes distance from the stories and sensory realities

 The story of the collection 'jutan aka Talaash' seems to expose the same inhuman rustic culture of a new anecdote: "if the fraternity of the village of Sagare goes unified, the bullet will be kept in the air

 chaar june kii raat kii ghatana yah ishaara karti he ki kahin sarkaar or sarkaar dwaara poshit logon kaa hi kalaadhan videshon main jamaa to nahin he
 Perhaps this is why our movement was crushed on 4 June
 ’’ramdev ne kaha, ‘‘yadi kaledhan ko waapas laane kaa mudda galat tha, yadi hamaara andolan aloktantric tha or yadi main sampradayik hum to hamase samvaad kyon kiya gaya
 Why did the Prime Minister write me a letter? ’’yogaguru ne kaha ki unke or unke samarthakon par hui karrwai loktantr kii hatya thi

 The yogguru said, "I didn't want to die a jackal
" mujhe centre kii kathputli bani police ke haathon ne nahin maranaa tha, isaliye main vahaan se nikal gaya
 Police fired tear gas shells at a closed pandal there and took barbaric action
 ’’unhone congress kaa naam liye bina kaha, ‘‘kya desh main ek hi party ke logon ko rahane kaa haq he

 Regarding allegations of fake passport of his close teacher Acharya Balakrishna, Yogguru said that this passport was made in 1998 and is not illegal
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sthaneey jaanch adhikari ne passport banane ke dauraan galat report di thi
 This is the fault of the administration
 isamen baalkrishna kii kya galati he
 He said that this is an attempt by the government to divert attention from issues of corruption and black money

There are machines but it is not interesting to use that in the hospital where MRI test It happens, the facility of swipe machine was found available but no one knows how to use the swipe machine, due to which Ramesh Chaudh came to test his father Ri had to pay ₹ 5000 in cash only

 When the best players in the world get to play in World Twenty20, then some records of T20 are almost certain to be broken
 lekin majaa to tab aayega, jab koi ek over main yuvaraj singh kaa 36 ran banane kaa record tod de
 How to break the record of 36 runs in an over? Yuvraj first made this record by hitting 6 sixes off 6 balls of Stuart Broad in World Twenty20
 yah record todna majaak nahin he, lekin asambhav bhi to nahin
 In 2012, African pacer Wayne Parnell bowled an eight-ball over, with two no balls
 england ke jose butler ne is over main 32 ran banaae the
 Similarly, if one or two no balls are received, more than 36 runs can be scored in an over
 aise hi kuch records, jinhen todna bahut mushkil he lekin asambhav nahin
 
 
 This record was also made in the first World T20, like the biggest team score 6 sixes in 1 over
 srilanka ne kenya ke khilaaf pehle batting karte hue 260 banaae the
 The Sri Lankan batsmen had rained fours and sixes
 is pari main 30 chauke or 11 chakke lage the
 In response, the Kenyan team was piled on for just 88 runs
 yah record todna kitna mushkil he, ise samajhane ke liye yah jaan len ki iske liye har over main 13 se zyada ran banane honge
 ALSO READ: These 10 records of cricket will never be broken! 12-ball half-century Yuvraj Singh made this feat in 2007 in his six-six innings
 har gend par chaukaa markar bhi yah record nahin todaa ja saktaa

 But Big Bash records do not count in T20 International

 Far from breaking Mendis' record, yet no other bowler could take 6 wickets in an innings in Twenty20 International
 ek pari main 156 ranaustralia ke aron finch ne ye kamaal 2013 main kiya tha
 Finch had scored 156 runs from just 63 balls
 is pari main unhone 14 chakke or 11 chauke lagaae the
 Finch is the only batsman to cross the 150 mark at Twenty20 International
 sabase badi pari khilne vaale ballebaajon kii list main finch ke baad unheen ke desh ke shen watasan he, jinhone bharat ke khilaaf janvari main 124 ranon kii naabad pari kheli thi
 467 runs in a match 467 runs in 40 overs
 south africa-australia ke match yah record bana tha
 The African team had scored 231 runs in their homeground at New Wanderers Stadium earlier, but Australia had achieved the target with four balls to spare
 40 overon main 44 chauke or 24 chakke lage the
 By the way, it was not a World Twenty20 match

 'australian media kaa atake, 'kohli kaa vyavhaar bacchon jaisaa or starhin'murali vijay ke ek kaich lapakane kaa daawa karne par smith ko unhen gaali dete camere ne kaid kar liya
 On this, o'keefe said that even though the catch was not clear, Smith should not abuse him

 Soon after the Prime Minister's Kumbh Snan in Prayagraj, a post on social media went viral, claiming that Harvard University says that the Mahakumbh Mela 2014 was better organized than the FIFA World Cup
 internet par zyaadaatar logon ne upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko iskaa shrey diya
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this post is confusing
 harvard uniwarsity kii jis report kaa zikr kiya ja rahaa he wo 2013 main yojit mahakumbh ke bare main he na ki ardhakumbh ke bare main
 The Facebook page "india Against Presstitutes" posted this article and wrote the headline "how many times have you seen that the world is praising any tradition of India, this is an example of what true leaders can do # modikumbhvisit"
 is post ko saikadon logon ne post kiya
 Twitter user Abhishek Mishra credited Mahakumbh to UP CM Adityanath with a Harvard University article
 Harvard University says Maha Kumbh Mela was better organised than the 2014 FIFA World Cup and Credit goes to our Staunch Hindu cm@myogiadityanathji
 - Abhishek Mishra (@abhishek_mshra) February 22, 2019 This post was retweeted by more than a thousand people and liked by more than 2 thousand people

 ye lekh 21 agast,2015 ko chapa gaya tha
 It talks about Mahakumbh 2013
 lekh main kaha gaya ki harvard uniwarsity ne teen mega events fifa 2014, mahakumbh 2013 or kaamanwealth khel 2010 kii tulana kii gai
 It found that Mahakumbh 2013 was conducted much better than both of those programs
 20 agast, 2015 koyehi report times of india akhbarmen bhi chhapi
 According to the report, 'research by the South Asia Institute of Harvard University in the US included the successful management of Mahakumbh 2013 in their book
 mahakumbh par chhapi is kitaab kaa vimochan tatkaaleen siem akhilesh yadav ne kiya tha
 At the time of organizing Mahakumbh in 2013, Akhilesh Yadav was the Chief Minister of UP and Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister of the country, so clearly it can be said that this viral post by the Congress is confusing
 ye lekh mahakumbh 2013 kaa he na ki ardhakumbh 2019 kaa

 uttar purvi dilli ke buraadi vidhansabha ilaake kii 30 coloniyon ko non electrical jone main daale jane ke virodh main ravivaar ko virodh pradarshan hua
 The people of the area, along with the Public Welfare Buddha Foundation, staged a protest and marched to the house of the MLA of the area, Sanjeev Jha
 pradarshnakariyon kaa kahana he ki saal 2014 main dilli sarkaar dwaara buraadi kii 30 coloniyon ko non electrical jone main daalaa gaya tha
 Due to which, for a new connection of electricity, it used to cost 36 hundred rupees for 1 kw, now it costs 10 thousand rupees
 saath hi 2 kilowat kebijaliconection ke liye pehle jo 42 sau rupee lete the ab 20 hajaar 80 rupee lagate hai
 In such a situation, the power companies are constantly being hit by the common man
 jiske kaaran unki jeb aae din dhili ho rahi he
 People say that when they have been electrified for about 10 years, transformers are installed, meters are installed and they are using electricity, then if they take a new meter, then it is said that their area is non Is in the electrical zone
 isliye unako yah rakam doguni deni padegi
 Resident Welfare Association (RWA) officer Khemraj has alleged that the local MLA and the power companies are together doing all this scam
 pradarshnakariyon kaa kahana he ki jab dilli main aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ai thi to unhone sasti bijli kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin aaj vah vaada sarkaar puri tarah se bhul gai he
 Increased electricity prices are hitting the general public
 yahi nahin pichley dinon jis tarah se dilli sarkaar dwaara fiks charge main badhat kii gai thi uskaa bhi asar logon ke bilon par khaasaa najar aa rahaa he
 The protesters say that many times they met the Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Burari on this matter, but no solution was found other than assurance
 jiske kaaran aaj ye log sadakon par hai
 Indra Kumar Yadav, who lives in a colony of Burari, has been living in Burari since 2014
 nayaa ghar lekarbijli ke conectionke liye applai kiya or 42 sau rupee security diposit bhi karai lekin non electrical jone main hone ke kaaran paisa rifund kar diya gaya
 When again applied for a fresh electricity connection, a new connection was found by paying 86 hundred rupees

 The first process of NRC was started in 1951 in Assam
 After 1971, the huge number of illegal immigrants from Assam, besides Delhi, Telangana, Bengal also came up in the demand of NRC, after the last list of NRC was released in Assam
 a crisis has arisen
 ye sankhya un logon kii he jinka naam enarasi kii aakhri list main nahin he
 NRC means National Register of Citizens
 ye wo sarkari dastavej he jo bataata he ki assam main rahane vaale koun se log bhartiya hai koun nahin?aasaan bhashaa main kahen to enarasi wo prakriya he jiske jariye desh main gaiyr-kanoonee taur par rah rahe videshi vyaktiyon ko khojane kii koshish kii jaati he
 The home minister of the country, Amit Shah, has promised to expel such illegal people from the country
 nehru ke raaj main aayaa desh kaa pehla nrcenaarasi kii jaden, british raaj, bharat ke bantwaare, aazaadee ke baad hue dange, bangladesh mukti sangram se judi hui hai
 But the country's first National Register of Citizens was formed in 1951 in Assam under the leadership of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
 1905 main british satta ne apane hit main bengal kaa bantwaaraa kar diya
 The British formed a new state in the form of East Bengal and Assam
 1947 main jab desh kaa bantwaaraa ho rahaa tha to assam ke logon main ye dar paidaa ho gaya ki kahin purvi pakistan ke saath jodakar assam ko bhi desh se alag na kar diya jaae
 The rebellion started in Assam under the leadership of Assam leader Gopinath Bardoloi
 idhar aazaadee ke baad tatkaaleen purvi pakistan or maujuuda bangladesh se badi sankhya main log assam main aane lage
 After the independence of the country, many areas were going through riots and violence due to Partition
 is dauraan assam main badi sankhya main purvi pakistan se log aae
 Their opposition started in Assam and soon a law and order problem arose here
 tatkaaleen nehru sarkaar ne purvi pakistan se aae avaidh apravasiyon ko bhartiya nagarikon se alag karne ke liye assam main pehle rashtriya naagarikta register (NRC) kii prakriya shuru kii
 The census work started before the NRC register was created and the national citizenship register was prepared from the census data
 9 farvari 1951 ko janaganana kii prakriya shuru kii gai
 a 20-day deadline was given to complete it
 9 farvari 1951 ko assam ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri biaar medhi ne janaganana kii shuruuaat karne ja rahe karmchaariyon ke ek samooh ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki janaganana ke jo aankde wo ikattha kar rahe hai usase bharat ke ganatantr kaa pehla neshnal register of citigens banaaya jayega
 There were 14 questions in the census form, out of which NRC was prepared with 11 questions
 24 march 1971 he NRC kaa nirdhaaran bindulagbhag 70 saal baad ek baar phir se assam phir NRC ko apadet kar rahaa he
 Certainly this process has become the cause of many controversies related to political, social and citizenship identity
 is nai enarasi list main shaamil hone ke liye dedline ke taur par jo taarikh di gai thi wo thi 24 march 1971
 Those who entered India before midnight of 24 March 1971 could join this list
 bataa den ki 25 march 1971 ko bangladesh yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha
 After that millions of Bangladeshi citizens started coming to India
 nishchit rup se bharat inhen apana naagarik maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The population of Assam grew rapidly after 1961, in fact between 1951 and 1961, Assam's population had increased by 36 percent
 jabaki 1961 se 71 ke bich assam kii aabaadi 35 fisadi badi thi
 The influx of refugees from war-torn East Pakistan was attributed to this
 inhi dashakon main jansankhya kii rashtriya vruddhi dar 22 or 25 pratishat thi
 People checking name in NRC list (photo-ap) When Bangladesh Liberation War started in 1971, there was a flood of illegal immigrants in Assam
 india today kii ek report ke mutabik 1971 se 1991 ke bich assam main matadaataaon kii sankhya main 89 pratishat kaa ijapha hua, jabaki 1991 se 2011 ke bich 53 fisadi voter assam main bade
 On 15 August 1985, Rajiv Gandhi signed the Assam Accord, meanwhile Assam continued to go through a period of instability
 assam main shanti kii sthapana 15 agast 1985 ko hui jab rajeev gandhi sarkaar ne avaidh apravasiyon ko rajya se baahar karne kii maang kar rahe andolankariyon se assam samjhauta kiya
 Under this, all the people who came to Assam between 1951 and 1961 were given citizenship and were given the right to vote
 1 janvari 1961 se 24 march 1971 ke bich assam main aae logon ko naagarikta to di gai, lekin unhen vot dene kaa adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 It was decided to send back those who came after 25 March 1971
 ab tak NRC ke chaar draft hue jarisal 2015 main supreme court ke dakhal ke baad NRC ko apadet karne kii prakriya shuru hui
 The first draft of the NRC was published on 31 December 2017 after going through several stages
 isamen isamen 3
 Only 1 in 29 crore people
 9 karod ko hi bharat kaa vaid naagarik mana gaya
 On 30 July 2018, the Assam government released the second draft
 isamen kul 2
 89 crore people were considered as legitimate citizens
 is tarah se kul lagbhag 40 lakh log NRC kii suchi se baahar ho gaye
 Another list was released on 26 June 2019
 is list ke aane ke baad NRC se lagbhag 1 lakh 2 hajaar log or bhi baahar ho gaye
 After this, the number of people left out of NRC increased to 41 lakh 10 thousand
 aakhirkaar 31 agast, 2019 ko enarasi kii aakhri list jari hui
 According to this list, more than 19 lakh people are out of NRC list
 NRC ke aankade hameshaa se raajnneetik vivaad ke saaye main rahe
 As soon as the figures of Assam came out, there was a demand for NRC in many states of the country
 dillidilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki dilli main bhi enarasi kii prakriya shuru kii jaani chahie kyonki dilli main badi sankhya main ghuspaithiye bas gaye hai
 BJP MLA from Telangana Telangana Raja Singh has demanded creation of NRC in Telangana
 raja singh ne twit kar kaha ki ve grih mantralay se apil karte hai ki NRC ko telugana main bhi lagu kiya jaae
 Raja Singh said that the MP from Hyderabad has given shelter to many Bangladeshis and Rohingyas for their vote bank
 aise logon ko baahar karne ke liye hyderabad libration de yani 17 sitambar se lagu se NRC lagu kiya janaa chahie
 West Bengal: Bharatiya Janata Party is demanding to implement NRC in West Bengal also
 pashchim bengal bijepi adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne kaha he ki desh kii aantarik suraksha ke liye bangladeshiyon ko baahar nikaala jaae or enarasi lagu kii jaae
 During the last Lok Sabha election in Kerala, BJP President Amit Shah said at an election rally in Kerala that his party's government would implement NAC and drive out all intruders
 mizorammizoram main bhi congress ko chhodkar sabhi sthaneey partiyaan rashtriya naagarik register (enarasi) lagu karne kii maang kar rahi hai

 ) This time the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh look different in themselves
 pichley teen dashak main pehali baar he jab koi dakait yaa purv dakait siyaasi ranbhumi main nahin utre hai
 Not only this, he is neither campaigning for any candidate
 haalanki, isse pehle dakaiton ke chunaav main utarane ke liye pradesh ke chambal or vindhya kshetra mashhoor rahe hai
 Not only this, some dacoits have also made headlines as mlas
 bataa den ki 2013 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main purv dakait prem singh congress kii tikat par madhya pradesh ke satna jile kii chitrakoot seat se chunavi maidan main utre the or unhone bijepi ke surendra singh gaharwar ko kareeb 10 hajaar maton se parajeet kiya tha
 Prem Singh, who traveled from Dasyu life to politics, was an MLA from this seat thrice
 wo 1998 or 2003 main bhi congress kii tikat par hi jeet kar vidhayak bane the
 Prem Singh, a former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and a staunch supporter of late veteran Congress leader Arjun Singh, died in May last year after a long illness
 bataa den ki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gwalior-chambal or vindhyas kshetra kii kareeb 39 siten aisi thi, jahaan par dakait yaa to chunavi maidan main utre the yaa phir kisi ummidavaar ke paksh main prachaar kiye the
 But this time the entire electoral movement is missing
 gwalior ke samajasevi doctor keshav pandey ne bataaya ki chambal ke bihadon main khauf se dahalane vaale purv daaku malakhan singh evam daaku manohar singh gurjar ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ke paksh main chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 Malkhan Singh surrendered to the Arjun Singh government nearly three-and-a-half decades ago after chanting terror in the Chambal Valley for more than 25 years and has now abandoned the gun and has taken the spiritual path
 haalanki badi-badi moonch rakhane vaale malakhan singh ne ek daur main panchayat chunaav ladaa tha or isamen jeet bhi hasil kii thi
 He has also been associated with various political parties
 1996 main bhind se sapa kii tikat par vidhansabha kaa upachunaav bhi lade the, lekin haar gaya
 Malkhan also campaigned for the Congress in MP and in Uttar Pradesh for SP
 pichley do vidhansabha chunaav main usne bijepi ke pratyaashiyon kaa samarthan kiya or unke liye vot bhi maange
 At the same time, the dacoit Manohar Singh Gurjar joined the BJP in the 90s and in 1995 became the President of Mehgaon Municipality of Bhind district
 haalanki, ab vah apana chota-motaa nijee kaarobaar karte hai
 At the same time, former dacoit Balwant Singh said that he is angry with the amendment in the SC / ST Act this year, but even then i am not supporting any political party in this election
 balavant jane maane dakait paan singh tomars kaa rishtedaar he
 Satna journalist Rajesh Dwivedi said that after Prem Singh's death, the era of dacoits influencing elections and winning elections from any seat by him has now ended in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki maujuuda samay main pradesh ke vindhyas kshetra ke behad main dakaiton ke do gang maujuud hai, jinamein bubbly kaul or lavalesh kaul shaamil hai
 However, there is no count in the political arena of these two gangs
 bataa den ki prem singh se pehle purv khoonkhaar dakait shiv kumaar patel urf dadua uttar pradesh ke chitrakoot or madhya pradesh ke vindhyas kshetra main chunaavon ko prabhavit karte the
 In the same way, the other dacoit Ambika Patel alias Thokiya used to influence the elections
 dadua kaa bhai bal kumaar patel sapa se saansad, bete vir singh vidhayak bhatija ram singh vidhayak rah chuke hai
 Dadua's brother and son are campaigning for the SP candidate in the Vindhya region seats in Madhya Pradesh assembly elections
 30 karod aabaadi main 3
 Threat to 5 crore Indians: Threat to Indians: Seven times the rising water level of the sea is threatening more than 300 million population of the world
 ek adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki agle 30 varshon main oonchi samudri lehren 30 karod se adhik logon ke sir se chat chin sakati hai
 3 out of this 30 crore population
 5 karod bhartiya bhi hai jinhen apane gharon se haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Hazard Estimates Earlier in a study, it was three times more than the number of people who had estimated the danger of sea level rise
 bhartiya logon ke saamne yah khatra pehle se saat guna adhik bad gaya he
 According to this new 'sophisticated' study, India is at seven times more vulnerable to the rising sea level due to which 3
 5 karod janata prabhavit hogi
 However, Indian scientists have challenged this study saying that there are flaws in this study
 urban deveopment and water resorcej par kaam karne vaale jiaies or remote sencing export raaj bhagat palanisami ne india today se kaha, 'nae jari hue adhyayan ke anumaanon or iske jokhim ko bhartiya sandarbh main saavdhaanee ke saath upyog kiya janaa he
 In this study, the database of America and Australia was taken and based on them, it was used in the context of the whole world
 isamen bharat ke jamini aankadon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 'in the study of scientists, this new study, led by disclosed Claimant Central scientists Scott a Kulp and Benjamin h Strauss, says that the melting of glaciers is increasing the sea level
 bharat main samudr ke kinare vaale ilaakon main rah rahe logon ke ghar samudr kii laharon main samaa sakate hai
 This study has been published by Nature Communication
 is adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki bharat main samudr ke tatavarti ilaakon main rah rahe logon ko pehle ke anumaanon kii tulana main saat guna adhik khatra he
 In this sophisticated study on sea level, it is said that India's 3
 5 karod se adhik jansankhya ke saamne khatra mandara rahaa he
 In this, apart from Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Kerala, some part is from Gujarat which will face terrible danger in the coming 30 years
 is adhyayan ke mutabik, naye anumaanon asia or khaskar bharat ke liye ahm hai jahaan duniya kii duusari sabase badi aabaadi rahati he
 By 2050, the threat of annual flooding has increased to eight times in Bangladesh, seven times in India, twelve times in Thailand and three times in China
 bharat ke bare main kya kahata he adhyayanmumbai, kolkata, chennai ke nichle tatavarti ilaake pehle se hi khatre main hai
 But the new study says that if carbon emissions are not reduced, marine flooding will engulf new areas in the next thirty years
 madhya kerala or gujarat ke kuch hisson samet bharat ke in shaharon main 2050 tak saal main kam se kam ek baar baadh jarur aegi
 Currently 3 in the coastal areas of the sea
 1 karod bhartiya rahete hai, 2030 tak yah jansankhya 3
 5 crores
 agar america sthit think tanks kaa adhyayan sach ho jaataa he to 2050 tak mumbai main dadar se kandiwali or navi mumbai main jawahar laal nehru port se lekar khaarghar tak ke ilaake bah sakate hai
 Similarly, statistics say that global warming also threatens Indian metros like Kolkata and Chennai
 kolkata ko kisi bhi duusare bhartiya shahar se zyada khatra he
 According to the Central Climate Data, about 30 percent of the houses in the low-lying areas will be destroyed in the next 30 years
 global varming kaa aisa hi dushprabhav chennai par padegaa
 Statistics say that floods can cause havoc in many important areas including main Chennai
 iske alaava madhya kerala or gujarat ke bhi kuch hisse prabhavit honge
 However, this inference is under doubt
 raaj bhagat ne india today se kaha, 'is adhyayan main upyog kiye gaye kuch aankade sahi nahin hai or bharat kii jamini vaastaviktaa ko nahin darshaate
 For many well-known areas, it exaggerates the threat estimate
 is bare main anumaan lagane se acha he ki hamaari sarkaar tatavarti ilaakon kaa naye sire adhyayan karaae, jisaki madad se aage mustaidi barti ja sake
 ' madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or congress ke kaddavar netaa digvijay singh ne bhopal sthit apana sarkari bangala khaali kar diya he

 However, after issuing new orders, their bungalows were given back to the former Chief Ministers and the real game happened in this too

 Last month, when the Shivraj government re-allotted the former bungalows to the government bungalows, the names of bjp's Uma Bharti, Babulal Gaur and Kailash Joshi were there, but Digvijay Singh of the Congress, who was the Chief Minister of MP for 10 years, was not named
 congress ne is mudde par pehle bhi shivaraj sarkaar par bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The High Court's order came on July 19 The Madhya Pradesh High Court on July 19, while giving a verdict on a PIL, had ordered the former Chief Ministers of the state to take action within a month, terming the provision of free lifetime government accommodation as illegal
 court ke is faisle ke maddenjar pradesh sarkaar ne chaar purv mukhyamantriyon jinamein congress netaa digvijay singh bhi shaamil hai, ke bangalon kaa aavanton nirast kar diya tha
 Following the court's order, the Shivraj government had called on the four former chief ministers, including Digvijay Singh, to appeal for re-allotment of the bungalow with reasonable cause
 jiske baad bijepi ke teenon netaaon ne bangale alot karne kii maang kii, jabaki digvijay singh ne aisa nahin kiya
 In the Gujarat assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi visited and visited the temple in every visit
 rahul ne rajya main chunavi prachaar kaa aagaaj dwarkadhish mandir se kiya tha
 On the last day of the Gujarat election campaign, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that our journey has come out

 i have wished for this bijepi kii theory he ki mai mandir nahin jaataa hum:rahulrahul ne kaha ki mandir main janaa manaa he kya?bijepi kii theory he ki main mandiranheen jaataa hum
 If you see, i have been going to the temple before
 baat den ki rahul ke mandir jane par bijepi ne bhi sawaal khadaa kiya he
 But Rahul said in his reply that i am a Shiva devotee
 itnaa hi nahin keval gujarat ke mandir jane ke sawaal par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kya kedarnath ko bhul gaye
 i did not go to Kedarnath

 pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke istife ke baad aaj shaam 4 baje patna main vidhayak dal kii baithak hogi
 Suspense remains in the name of the next Chief Minister
 khabar he ki nitish ke alaava vijendra yadav, vijay choudhary or ali anwar ke naam kii charchaa ho rahi he
 The RJD and Congress can support them to form the government after the name is decided by the JDU
 party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne nitish kumaar ke faisle ko tyaag bataaya he or saaf kar diya he ki secular gathbandhan banane ke liye vah rashtriya janata dal (argedy) jaisi dhur virdohi party se bhi talmail bana sakati he
 Sharad said that there is a need to forget old differences with Lalu Prasad Yadav's party
 unhone bataaya ki mukhyamantri ke naam par faisla ravivaar ko kiya jayega
 The JDU president said on Saturday, 'we will take a decision tomorrow (sunday) that will surprise the country
 ham desh ko bachaayenge
 Although RJD has said that they have not received any concrete proposal from JDU yet, they are keeping an eye on the changing situation
 haalanki, ajtak se exclusive baatcheet main lalu yadav ne saaf kar diya ki abhi tak gathbandhan ko lekar unki sharad yadav yaa nitish kumaar se koi baat nahin hui
 But if all goes well, there is a strong possibility of a JDU government in Bihar supporting the RJD

 The pond was taken over by the Mayawati government on 16 July 2003
 bhimrao ambedkar pakshi vihaar ghoshit kar diya
 a guest house was built within the boundary of the pond, but today there is no bird sanctuary facility

 In 2003, the Mulayam government overturned the Mayawati government's decision to convert this pond of Banti into a bird sanctuary and handed it over to Raja Bhaiya
 lekin 2007 main mayawati ke waapas lautne par is talab ko pakshi vihaar ke rup main behaal kar diya gaya
 Will Akhilesh, following in his father's footsteps, then hand over this bird sanctuary to King Bhaiya? petroleum mantri jaipal reddy ne sarkaar or nijee kshetra kii company reliance industries ke bich santhganth ke vipaksh ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki kaig kii rapat ke masaude ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa aarope lagaana thik nahin he
 Public Accounts Committee chairman Murali Manohar Joshi and Marxist Communist Party (CPM) leader Sitaram Yechury have accused the government of colluding with the private sector company based on the draft report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)
 reddy ne kaha ki yah keval masauda report he or petroleum mantralay isamen uthaaye gayi muddon kaa khule dimag se jawaab degaa
 Reddy said, i think they are adopting a biased attitude towards the cag's objective remarks by making such criticisms
 unhone kaha ki kaig ne jo mudde uthaae hai mantralay se unka jawaab milane ke baad hi antim report taiyaar hogi or phir use sansad main pesh kiya jayega, uske baad hi report lok lekha samiti ke paas pahonchegi

 janata dal (you) ke varisht netaa or bihar ke purv mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke guuruuvaar ko dilli aagaman ko lekar tamaam atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 There is a possibility that in the meantime there may be a discussion on the 'future' of the current Chief Minister of Bihar Jitan Ram Manjhi
 nitish kumaar ne dilli jane se poocha gaya ki kya maanjhi ji mukhyamantri rahenge, tab nitish ne kaha ki 'aisa aashwaasan dene vaale ham koun hote hai
 
 
 
 ' lekin unhone yah saaf kar diya ki vah dilli vilay ke sambandh main baatcheet karne ja rahe hai or unki yatra kaa bihar kii raajnneetik sargarmi se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 He made it clear that he does not need to go to Delhi for any program
 nitish ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki janata dal (you) main sabukach thik thaak he
 However, the main plan behind his visit is to discuss the process of merger between the constituents of his Janata Parivar
 magar, saath hi maanjhi ke bhavishya par charchaa kii sambhaavna se na to janata daal (you) ke netaa or na hi rashtriya janata daal ke netaa inkaar rakar rahe hai
 Anyway, Manjhi has made it clear in the last 48 hours with his statements and decision that he is not going to follow the directions of Nitish Kumar
 unhone yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki sarkaar bhi vah apni marji or apane alag agenda ke saath hi chalaayenge
 According to the close proximity of Nitish Kumar, Nitish is not only saddened by Manjhi's steps but also expressed regret over the decision to make him CM
 vahiin maanjhi ke nazdikiyon kaa kahana hai ki pichley kuch maheenon main apane kaamon se na keval unhone party ke vidhayakon kaa dil jeeta he balki dalit samaaj ke nae netaa banakar bhi ubhare hai
 In such a situation, his popularity is not digestible and at the moment it is difficult to 'tease' him because it can also get him into bjp's court
 maanjhi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main mahadalit voter ke nae avatar banakar ubharenge
 However, the leaders of Janata Dal (U) and Rashtriya Janata Dal believe that the relaxation of Manjhi will only harm the interests of the Grand Alliance
 isliye, unke sambandh main ab koi bhi nirnay party ko jald se jald lenaa chahie
 Manjhi may have already got an idea of the atmosphere against him, so he has started making rhetoric against the BJP to keep the party leaders happy

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri yusuf raza gilaani ne videsh mantri hina rabbaani khar ko fouran desh lautne kaa hukum diya he
 Hina Rabbani Khar is currently in the US
 pakistan hakkaani network or iesai ke gathjod ke aaropon par america se naakhush he
 Gilani has termed the US allegations as part of the ongoing propaganda against Pakistan and said that this is worsening the atmosphere
 gilaani ne desh main suraksha kii haalat par baatcheet ke liye vipakshi dalon kii baithak bhi bulaai he
 It is being said that Hina Rabbani Khar has been called to attend this meeting
 is bich, pakistan ke army chif general kayaani ne top cmanderon ke saath bhi baithak kii
 Pakistan is very unhappy with the US accusations
 hina rabbaani khar ne enditivi ke saath baatcheet main kaha bhi he ki is tarah ke bayanon se america aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main apane ek ahm sahyogi ko kho saktaa he
 a news that scares the heart for many reasons - because once again it is clear how easily one can destroy a girl's life
 
 
 isliye bhi, kyonki dikhataa he ki kaise aparaadhiyon ko na ke baraabar sazaa mili
 
 
 And also because this suffering girl is not getting any help from anywhere for treatment
 
 
 nau saal pehle kii sonaali mukherjee, ensisi captain, college kii topper, hansatii-khelti, ek aam ladki thi
 
 
 But after nine years, not only has Sonali, 27, changed her life, but her face has also deteriorated, her eyes have lost light, and there is hardly any part of the body that is not burnt
 ek hafte se sonaali dilli main he
 He has only two demands - or he gets justice or euthanasia
 
 
 sonaali kii dardanaak kahani ko shabdon main bayaan karnaa mushkil he, lekin enditivi india se baatcheet main usne apane jivan kii kadavi sachai bataai
 According to Sonali of Dhanbad, Jharkhand, it was the night of April 22, 2003, when three boys from her neighborhood came to her house and threw acid on her
 tejaab ke chhinte uski choti bahan or pita par bhi gire, lekin sonaali 72 pratishat jal gai
 According to Sonali, those boys used to seduce her, and when she protested, she did such a thing
 ghatana ke 20 din baad police ne teen aropiyon ko giraftaar kiya
 The case continued in the Dhanbad district court, but six months after the incident, Sonali's grandfather died due to the shock, while the mother is still dead
 teen saal baad, yani varsh 2006 main dhanbad jila court ne do doshiyon ko nau saal kii sajaa sunai, jabaki ek naaballig hone ke kaaran batch gaya
 The accused went to the Jharkhand High Court against that conviction, and in 2007, the court granted them bail
 jamaanat milte hi sonaali ke parivaar ko dhamkiyaan milane lageen or ilaaj ke boj tale sab kuch lut gaya
 According to Sonali's father, about Rs 12 lakh has been spent in her treatment
 dilli ke safadarajang or ames aspataal main uski kai or surgery honi hai, lekin ab ilaaj ke liye uske paas paise nahin bache hai
 The comments vaise media main khabar dikhaae jane ke baad sonaali kii madad ke liye kai haath aage aae hai
 Renowned lawyer Ram Jethmalani met Sonali at her home on Monday, and assured financial assistance along with a financial assistance of Rs one lakh 39 thousand
 sonaali kii madad karne ke liye aap punjab neshnal bank kii dilli kii nauroji nagar shakha main chandidas mukherjee ke acount number 0612−000−1032−17964 main paise jamaa kar sakate hai yaa phir is bare main unke bhai devashish mukherjee ke number 0943−7638−600 par baat kar sakate hai
 Nine years ago, Sonali Mukherjee, NCC Captain, college topper, laughing and playing, was a common girl
 
 
 lekin nau saal baad aaj 27 saal kii sonaali kii na sirf zindagi badal chuki he, balki cheharaa bhi buree tarah bighad gaya he, uski donon ankhon kii roshni ja chuki he, or sharir kaa shaayad hi koi hissaa aisa ho, jo jala na ho
 Sonali has been in Delhi for a week
