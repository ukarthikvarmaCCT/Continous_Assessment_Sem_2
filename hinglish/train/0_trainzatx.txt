 But the soul is nowhere

 dilli main haalanki sukun ke kuch avasar aate rahete hai
 One of the most important occasions was to come to Girija Devi at some pretext, organize and listen to her singing
 paan dabe gaal se ek khatti-mithi ter bhari wo awaz jo ab shahari mahilaon ke kanth se sunne ko nahin milti
 For which one has to return towards the areas in the lap of the Ganges, towards the villages or the villages towards the cities covered in their pucca houses
 paramparaon kii gandh, mitti kaa swaad or maa jaise apnatv vaali ye awaz thi girija devi kii
 When i used to listen to them singing, i wanted to go and sit on my lap
 ek shaam unhen sun lo to hafton khumaari chai rahati thi
 Then he used to listen to his audio and youtube links for many days
 is shahar main jab-jab niraashaa sir par naachne lagati he, bhimsen joshi, kishori amonkar, girija devi or kumaar gandharva hi dhankos bandhaate hai
 Rashid Khan fills new life again
 girija devi kii aawaaj main jo tehraav tha or jo vishwaas, sachai, wo lambey sangharshon se arjeet hua tha
 The family, especially the mother, was never in favor of her going out in public and singing
 veena vaali devi ko poojane vaala yah samaaj gane vaali mahila ko bahut nakaaratmak drushti se dekhtaa he
 But through confidence and truth, Girija continued to sing and fight against every adversity
 yahi unki aawaaj kii takat bhi rahi
 Actually, Girija Devi had a twisted tone in her voice
 yahi ter mujhe har baar bismillah khan kii shehanai main bhi sunai di
 It is not rustic or desperation in Chhannulal
 wo masaan kii holi main udate phag kii tarah hai
 Shivaay, serious and sweet
 lekin yah jo gale main basii hui shehanai he na, keval begum akhtar or girija devi ko hi naseeb thi
 Akhtari Bai had said goodbye to Kabi, now Girija also went to her in-laws after the death
 is aawaaj kii takat or tehraav ko ab kisi or gale main khoj paanaa mushkil kaam he
 The rest sing
 kuch unase siikhe yaa unase anusaran karne vaale bhi hai
 But that is not the case with others
 baaki madhur hai, vividh hai, sugam bhi
 But deep, cold, clean and not at all stagnant like Girija Devi
 girija devi kaa janaa sangeet kii ek parampara main se hamaare samay kii annapurna ke chale janaa jaisaa he
 The story of Kashi is not complete without Annapurna
 or agar annapurna bina apni chaaya praan pratishthit kiye chali jaaen to yah kaashi kaa chalaa janaa he
 Truly, a Kashi of music tradition is lost today, asleep forever
 banaras ke parichiton, mitron or 'kasivasiyon' se milte hue isapar har baar charchaa hoti he ki kaashi kahaan ja rahaa he
 Kashinath Singh in his novel 'kashi Ka Assi' says that Kashi is slowly losing its laughter and fun
 dhire-dhire mar rahaa he
 That is probably because the stagnation is ending with Kashi
 tehraav ke liye mamatv chahie or mamatv ke antim pratibimbon main girija devi pratishthit najar aati thim
 When she left, there was a loss from Kashi
 ab tehraav kahaan
 And without stagnation, there is no pleasure, nor happiness
 bas naahak khis nipori ja sakati he
 Therefore, the departure of Girija Devi is not just the end of a musical tradition
 girija ke saath kaashi kaa wo sabakuch bhi khatm hota dikh rahaa he jo hamen samay ke chakravaat main sabase behatar sanbhale rakh saktaa tha
 If you search for some nuggets that sing Chaiti, Jhula, Kajari, Thumri and Sohar, then where can you find Girija Ki Baat
 ek girija hi to thim
 What will Chhannulal alone handle now? kaashi kaa ab kya hoga? Asaduddin Owaisi said of giving Bharat Ratna to Savarkar in Maharashtra bjp's resolution letter, All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has also said to give Bharat Ratna to Nathuram Godse

 lats boy bi dame boij
 Late man be dam man
 soshal media par in dinon shaving kit banane vaali company gilette kaa ek vigyaapan surkhiyaan bator rahaa he
 In this, the stereotype thinking about men has been questioned
 gilette ke is # thebestmancanbe campagne kii taareef bhi ho rahi he to vahiin isaki jamkar aalochana bhi kii ja rahi he
 After all, who are real men? How can it be defined? Generally, the thinking of society fit in a particular groove for men
 real main yani vastav main mard wo hote hai jo, bachapan se hi apane hamaumr ladako par dhauns jamaate hai
 Bullying for his weaknesses (read innocence), he is sometimes called a freak, sometimes a loser
 unke man main is baat ko bitha dete hai ki unase har koi nafrat karata he kyonki wo duhkhi hone par ro dete hai
 They play with girls
 unamem wo aakraamakata nahin hai, jo mardaangi ke liye jaruri he
 As the 'real man' grows up, he learns to be angry
 apni baat manwaane ke liye chinata-chillaata he
 He never expresses pain even if he hurts
 sirf ghar main hi nahin college, offis, sadak har jagah apni apni mardaangi kaa saboot ladakiyon ko chhedakar, to unhen galat tareeke se chhukar detaa he
 Sometimes manhood becomes so powerful that women who work with it just look at it with such close attention that they become disrespectful
 sirf itnaa hi nahin 'asli mard' wo bhi hote hai jo kisi bhi rishte main domineting pojishan main rahete hai
 Regardless of marriage, sex, children, the decision is theirs
 lekin ye to steriotip paribhaasha he real main kii
 In reality, the real men are those who think that there is no one weaker than them
 wo kisi par dhauns dikhne ke bazaay un ladakon kii madad karte hai, jo kisi bhi vajah se peeche chhootane lagate hai
 Whether it is about school, college, or playground, they believe in taking everyone along
 wo sadak par apane doston ko kisi ladki ko chhedane se rokte hai
 They explain to their friend that it is wrong to tease a girl like this
 wo offis main kisi mahila-sahakarmi ke saath ho rahe kisi bhi tarah ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland karte hai
 They talk about equality in relationships
 ghar main wo kaam karte hai patni, bahan or maa ke saath milakar
 They make tea and coffee for them during the period
 kabhi jo tabiyat karaab ho jaye apane saathi kii, to haath-pair bhi dabaa dete hai
 They also carry out the responsibility of feeding the children from changing diapers to feeding them and telling the story
 wo dukhi hone par ro lete hai maan kii god main sir rakh yaa apni hamasafar ke kaandhen se tik kar
 This is the beauty of being male
 magar is duniya main bahut kam aise mard hai
 And those who are such men try to embarrass their male partners
 ek shaving kaa saamaan banane vaali company kaa nayaa vigyaapan shaayad isi steriotip ko todane kii koshish karata dikhataa he
 Advertising is obviously advertising
 par isamen chhipe bhav ahm hai
 That, since childhood, we should present such examples in front of the boys that they should respect everyone later
 bachche hamen dekhakar bade ho rahe hai, to kya ham unhen apane se kamazor par dhauns jamaana, ladakiyon ko chhedana, offis main bina concent ke unhen choona, maar-kutai karnaa or cheekh-chillaakar apni baat manavaa lenaa sikhaa rahe hai!magar do din pehle laanch hue is video ko america jaise viksit desh ke mard bhi kos rahen hai
 They feel that this video is attacking their manhood
 unke musculin hone ko galat raushnee main dikhaa rahaa
 From Twitter to Instagram, advertisements are being opposed everywhere
 jane-maane patrkaar, lekhak or kai tivi sho ke jaj 'piers morgan' ne ne twitor handle par is vigyaapan par apana virodh darz karavaate hue twit kiya he,“let boys be damn boys
 Let men be damn men
 ”is ek twit se andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he ki, mard hone kii paaramparik paribhaasha hamaare man main kitne gahare jaden jamaa chuki hai
 Just think, in the advertisement of thousands of products, women are portrayed as perfect mothers, beautiful wives, savory girlfriends
 lagbhag har tisare vigyaapan main unhen ye bataaya jaataa he, ki falaan chaay piyo to dubli dikhogi, falaan kriim lagaao to gori ho jaaogi, falaan masala istemaal karke tum best maa or patni kahalaaogi
 But women have never protested against them, because this is what girls are taught from childhood
 chaahe wo jo bhi ban jaye aakhir main unhen hi ghar sanbhaalanaa he, washing main muskura kar kapade dhone hai, ghar ko chamakaakar rakhana he, gharavaalon kii har kushi kaa khyaal rakhte hue unhen parfect bananaa he
 Today when the same marketism has tried to show these men a little mirror, then this kind of protest is being registered
 ye mardon ko lekar fudal soch kii gaharaai ko dikhaane ke liye kaaphi he
 But whatever opposition there is, it is happy that a company that makes razors and shaving creams for men waged a campaign against stereo-type
 vigyaapan ke aakiri hisse main kahi gayi baat ki, "jab tak ham mard khud ko or behatar karne ke liye chailenj nahin karenge, tab tak hamaari aane vaali pidiyon ko ham apana sabase acha rup kaise dikhaa paaenge
 "this thing raises a flame of hope that, which has now begun, the matter will reach the end at some point! (anu Roy is an independent writer and writes on women's rights

 a few days ago, Manish Sisodia looked busy at his government residence on Mathura Road, as if the mountain of work had been lost
 ve apane offis se baahar aate hai to maafee maangate hue kehete hai, ''sori, maine abhi-abhi 50-60 filein nibatai hai
 "they have to catch a late night flight to Finland
 par hakeekat yah he ki pichley kuch hakraton se dilli sarkaar kaa kaam thap ho gaya he
 The next day, when Sisodia was flying in his executive class at a height of 30,000 feet in the sky of the capital, the fourth death was reported from Chikungunya in a hospital in Delhi

 And while Sisodia was on the way to Helisinki, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain was in Goa

 Reporters and news anchors were dodging the question, "who is watching the work here?" And the simple answer is - no one
 pichley maheene dilli hycourt ne faisla sunaaya tha ki alji hi dilli ke mukhya prashaasak hai
 Since then, it seems that AAP has swollen and is awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court on its appeal
 uske baad party ke cabinet mantri sandip kumaar (ab barkhaast) ek bade scandle main ulajh gaye or party ke ek anya netaa par chhedchhad kaa cese darj hua he
 At the same time, the Election Commission's decision on 21 party mlas in the Parliamentary Secretary appointment case is awaited whether they are disqualified on the alleged charge of the post of profit
 aap ke rashtriya pravaktaa ashutosh gussa jataate hai, ''ek chuni hui sarkaar ko sirf salaah dene ke adhikaar tak simit kar diya gaya he
 "about ten days ago, the National Commission for Women has sent summons to Sandeep Kumar for writing a blog stating the mutual consent of adults
 ashutosh kehete hai, ''ayog ne abhootpurv jaldbaaji main karrwai kii
 People of BJP and RSS make objectionable statements everyday, but the Commission does not give them any notice
 modi ne sunanda pushkar ko 50 karod ru
 What did the commission do about that? "this is aap's own special way that the party is being harassed by Modi and BJP
 sisodiya bhi alji ke saath takaraav ke mudde par aap kaa jamkar bachaav karte hai or sari jimmedaari kaa thikra alji par daal dete hai
 He says, "we are working day and night, but the lgs are obstructive in our work
 " sisodiya is baat se inkaar karte hai ki naukarshahon ke saath aap ke rishte achche nahin hai
 He says that he is being pressured by Jung, who then responds to Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 stambh lekhak santosh desai sweekaar karte hai ki aap kii ore se khud ko nishaanaa banaae jane ke daawey main kuch dam jarur he
 "it cannot be denied that they have no place to do anything," he says

 You have to fight with everyone, even yourself
 " yah khatra bhi he ki bade-bade vaade karne vaali sarkaar kaamkaaj ko lekar bephikr hoti ja rahi he
 So should voters keep a watch on lg's futile investigation into the government's perceived neglect of protocols? Or will they keep watching a crippled government silently? a leader of AAP says that if Kejriwal ignores Delhi for Punjab, it is fine
 ve kehete hai, ''dilli main unke haath bandhe hai
 If you win in Punjab, it will increase its credibility in Delhi and it will be difficult for LG and BJP to create obstacles
 " sisodiya kaa kahana he ki ''party ke netaa ke taur par kejariwal se yah ummid bemaani he ki ve duusare rajyon ke prachaar main ahm bhoomika na nibhaaen
 He is in the role of inspector, as should be the chief ministers
 ve apane mantriyon se prashasan kii puri jaankaree lete rahete hai
 "due to the frequent disappearance from Delhi, there is a growing perception about Kejriwal that he is not paying much attention to Delhi
 ashutosh isse inkaar karte hai, ''ve kuch hi baar dilli se baahar gaye hai, ve sirf ek baar rome gaye, punjab or goa kaa daura bhi kuch hi baar kiya, or gujarat sirf ek baar gaye
 "according to the party, it is not that he is no longer interested in Delhi
 baat yah he ki aap apni koshish main asafal ho gai he, kyonki hycourt ke faisle ne chuni hui sarkaar ke mukaable alji ko zyada adhikaar de die hai
 But people are seeing that the party may not be doing enough to overcome the obstacles
 sisodiya kehete hai, ''modi or bijepi dilli kii janata se khafa hai or khud ko khaarij kiye jane ke kaaran unase badla le rahe hai
 "kejriwal tweets," CM and ministers no longer have any right, not even the right to buy a pen
 dilli ke maamle main alji or piem ke paas hi saare adhikaar hai
 "his tear-jerking statement appears to be an helpless man
 lekin dilli ke logon main kejariwal kii chhavi dhakad netaa ke taur par rahi he, jisane party ko baari jeet dilaai thi
 AAP and Kejriwal will have to re-establish their identity

 The CBI has registered a case of corruption against an under secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 sibiai ko anand joshi ke ghar se mantralay kii filein bhi mili hai
 The officer is accused that he used the information received from the Foreign Fund Regulation Act (FCRA) cases to blackmail ngos
 iske alaava enjio ko epasiare kii manjuuri dilaane ke liye filon main herapheri karne kaa bhi aarope he
 Now the CBI says that the business of recovery was going on from the Home Ministry itself and Joshi was running this business from this building
 sibiai ke mutabiq anand joshi kai ngos ko FCRA kaa notice jari kar unase paise vasuul kiya karata tha
 All these ngos get funding from abroad
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki joshi ko kuch nijee companiyon se rishwat ke taur par achal sampatti bhi mili or joshi ngos ko unke bare main jaankaree dekar unase rishwat bhi letaa tha
 The Home Ministry gave the case to the CBI after the files related to the issue of Teesta Setalvad's NGO Sabrang disappeared
 baad main filein mil bhi gayi
 7 from Joshi's house
 5 lakh rupee ke alaava grih mantralay or ibi kii filein mili hai jinhen wo ghar nahin le ja sakate the
 According to the rules, only the Joint Commissioner and above officers can take the file home
 tippaniyan The CBI has registered a caterpillar of corruption against Joshi and in addition to his house three places including the North Block - Red have also been killed
 udhar joshi kii patni ne apane pati ke senior adhikari par gambheer aarope lagaae hai
 Anand Joshi's wife Meenakshi said, "my husband is being falsely implicated
 unke senior driver ke zarie hi filein ghar bhejte the
 ' khud anand joshi ne bhi mana ki unke senior unhen kai ngos ko clin chit dene ke liye un par daawaab bana rahe the
 When he did not listen to his superior, he was implicated in the case
 lekin sibiai ne in aaropon ko kaarij kar diya
 In the morning, the CBI team along with Anand Joshi searched their bank accounts and lockers
 darasal ye kahani badi isliye he kyonki ye bataati he ki kis tarah videshi companiyaan sarkari babuon ko kuch paisa dekar sarkaar ke faisale badalawaane kaa kaam karti hai or agar badalawa nahin sakati to system ko kaise over rule kiya ja saktaa he iske bare main jaankaree hasil karti hai
 And because all the matters in the Ministry of Home Affairs are very sensitive, this matter is very serious
 ab sibiai kaa kahana he grih mantralay se hi vasuuli kaa dhandha chal rahaa tha or is dhandhe ko is building se joshi hi chalaa rahaa tha
 According to the CBI, Anand Joshi used to issue FCRA notices to many ngos and used to recover money from them
 in sab ngos ko videsh se fnding milti he
 The CBI says that Joshi also got immovable property from some private companies as a bribe and Joshi used to take bribes from ngos by informing them about them
 grih mantralay ne ye maamla sibiai ko tab diya jab tista sitalwar ke NGO sabrang ke masale se taalluk rakhane vaali filein gaayab ho gayi
 Later files were also found
 joshi ke ghar se 7
 Apart from Rs 5 lakh, the files of the Ministry of Home Affairs and IB have been found which they could not take home
 niyamon ke mutabiq sanyukt ayukta or uske upar ke afasar hi fil ghar le ja sakate hai
 The comments sibiai ne joshi ke kilaaf bhrashtachar kaa kamala darj kiya he or uske ghar ke alaava teen jagah jisamen north blaak shaamil he - red bhi maari he
 On the other hand, Joshi's wife has made serious allegations against her husband's senior officer
 anand joshi kii patni minakshi ne kaha, "mere pati ko jhootha fansaaya ja rahaa he
 His seniors used to send files home through the driver
 ' Anand Joshi himself also admitted that his seniors were claiming him for giving him a clean chit to many ngos
 jab unhone apane senior kii nahin maani to unhen is maamle main fansaa diya gaya
 But the CBI dismissed these allegations
 subah sibiai kii team ne anand joshi ko saath lekar unke bank khaaton or lokaron kii talaashi lee
 Actually, this story is big because it tells how foreign companies work to change the decisions of the government by paying some money to the government babus and if it cannot be changed then the system can get information about how to rule it over Huh
 or kyonki grih mantralay main sabhi maamle kaafii samvedansheel hote hai, isliye ye maamla kaafii gambheer he

 aapane aksar ghar, daftar, skulon yaa anya jagahon par tange hue calandaron ko dekha hoga
 But you will be surprised to know that this calendar which hangs on the walls before the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections is in controversy these days
 empi kii rajdhani bhopal main empi congress ne to calandaron ko bain karne tak kii maang kar di he
 Let me tell you that this is not a minor calendar but it is the official calendar, which these days the Madhya Pradesh Congress is upset and has demanded from the Election Commission that government calendars should be banned
 madhya pradesh congress ne is babat kendriya nirvachan ayog ke mukhya nirvachan ayukta ko khat likh shaskeey calandaron par bain lagane kaa aagrah kiya he
 According to Manak Agarwal, media in-charge of Madhya Pradesh Congress, there is a photo of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan on every page of the government's calendar for the year 2018 of the Madhya Pradesh government, as well as information about the schemes being run by the government
 maanak agarwal ke mutabik puure madhya pradesh main aise kareeb dedh lakh calandar alag-alag sarkari daftaron or gharon main tange hue hai jo aane vaale chunaav ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the Congress has also objected to the tiles being installed at the main gate of houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 maanak ke mutabik piem awaas yojana ke tahat gharon main lagaai ja rahi tiles par pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii tasviren lagi hai or oktober main sambhavit aachaar samhita ko dhyaan main rakhte hue chunaav se pehle sabhi shaskeey calendar or tiles par pratibandh lagaaya jaae
 BJP called this demand, 'congress's frustration' The Congress has called Congress's frustration by the Congress's demand for a ban on the official calendar and PM Awas Yojana
 madhya pradesh bijepi ke mukhya pravaktaa deepak vijayawargeey ne ajtak se kaha ki congress party chaar saal se centre main satta se baahar he or 15 saal se madhyapradesh se baahar he
 They have never gone public, so the Congress party has always been dependent for power to stay in the headlines and to campaign and hence it is frustrating when the Congress is out of power
 deepak vijayawargeey ne kaha ki sarkaar kii apni karypranali he ki kis tarah se apni yojanaon ko janata tak pahunchaae usamen sarkaar kaa netritv karne waalon kii bhi bhoomika hoti he
 Therefore, Congress should not be jealous or frustrated with them, where their government carries forward their plans, then Congress should get out of this frustration and go among the people
 kichan main kaam karnaa or uske baad use puure salike se saaf karnaa donon hi kala hai
 There are many people who spread the whole kitchen while cooking
 vahiin kuch aise bhi hote hai jo puure vyavasthit tareeke se kaam karte hai
 Similarly, there are many people who clean the kitchen after finishing the work, but there are some who do the upper cleaning but leave the cleaning of the tiles and floor
 aise main ek baat dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki jo mehnat aap aaj bachaa rahi hai uske badale aapako bhavishya main zyada pasinaa bahaanaa padegaa
 Daily cleaning does not freeze the dirt and the kitchen gets cleaned quickly
 kichan kii safai ko do bhaagon main baantkar aap apane kaam ko aasaan bana sakati hai:1
 Daily Cleaning - Put a mop in your kitchen daily
 pochhe ke pani main disergent yaa ek keetanunashak kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 It should be taken care that the cloth you are mopping with should not be dirty
 istemaal ke baad use saaf bhi karnaa jaruri he
 -if you have an army of ants in your house, add salt in the wipe water and apply it
 -yadi aap kuch dinon ke baad apana farsh saaf kar rahi hai to garm pani kaa pochha lagaaein
 -to get good results, after mopping, do a dry mop on the same floor
 isse aapkaa farsh chamakdaar rahegaa or dhul nahin jamegi
 -if something falls on your floor, clean it immediately
 aisa karne se daag nahin banenge
 2
 tiles kii safayeegar aap apane kichan ke tiles ko har roj saaf nahin karti hai to ek din safai karnaa aapako pareshaani main daal saktaa he
 There are many such things in our house, using which we can easily clean the kitchen tiles: - Make a mixture of 2 cups of cup and 2 cups of water and put it in a clean spray bottle
 ise tiles par spray karen or ek micro fibre kapade kii madad se use saaf karen
 Micro fiber fabric absorbs dirt better than other fabrics and does not scratch the surface
 -baking sodabaking soda kaa istemaal karke aap aasaani se daag se chhutkaaraa paa sakati hai
 Make a thick paste of baking soda and water and apply it on the stain
 10-15 minute tak ise sookhne den or phir geele kapade se saafe kar len
 If this stain is stubborn, you can clean it with an old toothbrush
 -bleech yaa ammoniayadi aapaki tiles kaaphi gandi ho chuki he to bleech or pani ko saamaan maatra main mila len
 Apply this mixture in a circular position on the surface
 ab tiles ko garm pani se saafe kar len
 After that clean it with a dry cloth
 bleech kaa istemaal karte vakt dastaane jarur pahanen

 In the past, when the tribal Dana Manjhi had to walk many kilometers on his shoulder keeping his wife's body on his shoulder, those pictures shocked the country

 Despite the efforts of the government, another 'dana Manjhi' incident has come up in Odisha's Jajpur district
 darasal yahaan ke madhuban saamudayik chikitsaalay main kaliya munda naam ke shaks ne apni maa maina ko ilaaj ke liye aspataal main bhartee karaayaa tha

 wo ab jhuggi main rahane vaale bacchon kii padhai ke liye ghar-ghar jaakar logon se bekaar lakdi maangate hai
 Then they make benches and desks etc
 from those sticks and give them to the ongoing open school for these children

 He claims that he has donated hundreds of benches to school children
 ye desk aise skulon main die hai jahaan bachche garmi or sardi main jameen par baithkar padhai karte the
 This is how the beginners say that once they saw children sitting on the ground in the cold near the slums of Yamuna Khadar, the mind was sad
 ye bachche jhuggi main chal rahe skool main jameen par baithe the
 i started the initiative from there and went door to door asking people for wood
 log kabaade main rakhi lakadiyaan dene lage to silsilaa chal niklaa
 Elder Carpenter Raisuddin also has a big role in making benches for children
 ram gopal lakadiyaan mangakar laate hai to raisuddin in lakadiyon ko apni mehnat se bench kaa aakaar dete hai
 They charge very little for this
 bachche or patni kar rahe maddramgopal bataate hai ki unki patni sushila devi ritair teacher hai
 i started with his pension
 tab maine ek karcenter rakhaa tha, phir jab log bacchon ke kapade bhi dene lage to unhone ek tailor bhi rakhaa

 ramgopal kehete hai ki ab mujhe betaa-bahu or meri beti bhi madad kar rahi hai
 Along with this, the people of the society also help in delivering wood or distributing bench-cloth

 Britain-born writer Atish Ali Taseer is accused of concealing information that his father was of Pakistani origin
 is aadhaar par bharat sarkaar ne pichley dinon osiai card radd kar diya tha
 It is believed that Atish Ali Taseer can now challenge the decision of the Government of India if the OCI card is canceled
 unhone pichley dinon kaha ki vah sarkaar ke faisle ko court main chunauti denge
 Why Atish Taseer was disqualified? Last week, a spokesman of the Union Home Ministry was told that Atish Taseer is the son of Indian journalist Tavleen Singh and the late leader of Pakistan Salman Taseer
 unhen osiai card ke lihaaj se ayogy kar diya gaya he kyonki yah card aise kisi vyakti ko jari nahin kiya jaataa jiske mata-pita yaa dada-daadi pakistan se hon or us vyakti ne is sambandh main jaankaree chupaaya ho
 During the general elections held in the country seven months ago, Atish Taseer wrote an article in Time magazine on Prime Minister Narendra Modi titled 'dividers in Chief'
 haalanki, chunaav parinaam ke tatkaal baad palati maarthe hue time magazine ne ek report jari kii, jiskaa sheershak tha, 'modi ne bharat ko itnaa ekajute kiya, jo ki dashakon main koi pradhanmantri nahin kar sakaa
 Prior to this article, Atish Taseer's article published in the pre-election time was heavily used by Narendra Modi's opponents during the election campaign and was criticized by Modi's critics as 'divisive' by a global media powerhouse
 Said to be accused

 hindu reeti se hone vaale vivaah main mandap sabase ahm hota he
 The pavilion is not merely a thatch covered with mango leaves, with it are the deities who are invoked and they give their blessings to the bride and groom who enter new life and witness their marital bond
 Are made
 ab badale daur main paramparaon kaa jaise-jaise aadhunikeekaran hota gaya, vaise-vaise mandap par bhi iskaa asar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Due to this formality, the demand for readymade pavilion has increased now
 hitech or bhaagam-bhaag vaali jindagi kaa hissaa ban chukaa insaan ab rasmon ko bhi apane andaaj main sametane laga he
 According to religious customs, marriage ceremonies begin with the pavilion
 iske liye purohit din or samay nishchit karte hai
 The pavilion, which is buried at the appropriate time, honors the auspicious time after the wedding
 manyata he ki shaadi ke shubh muhoort par purohit ke aavahan par sabhi devtaa mandap ke neeche virajman rahete hai or vaivaahik jode ke liye sukhi vaivaahik jivan ke dwaar kholte hai
 There was a time when Kanyapaksha used to have great enthusiasm and sense of responsibility regarding the pavilion
 mandap ko itani ahyimat di jaati thi ki iske liye ghar ke bade-bajurg pehle se hi taiyaariyon main jute jate the
 Such beliefs have been considered in society since the beginning
 lekin vakt ke saath aae badlaav kaa asar he ki aaj logon ne mandap kaa doosraa formula taiyaar kar liya he
 Due to the increasing population, shrinking houses and confined spaces, the pavilion is being erected in some way in some corner of the marriage hall, then in such an open field, the pavilion is being made in a place where only the limited people of the bride and groom side
 In order to be present, other places are being used for wedding arrangements, stage and catering
 darasal, mandap ab peeche chhutata ja rahaa he or shaadi kaa sara aakarshan 'jaymaal' or deje tak simatata ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the pavilion is now full of formality for the fans
 shaadi ke anya intjaamon ke saath-saath tent vaale ko mandap kaa bhi jimmaa saunp diya jaataa he, jiske karigar aanan-fanan main minuton main mandap taiyaar karke chale jate hai
 Even if the girl's side is worried about the rest of the wedding arrangements, the mandap usually does not become a concern anymore
 vahiin dahej rahit vivaahon ke samarohon main to saikadon mandap thok ke bhav ek saath mangaaye jate hai or shaadiyaan samaapt hone ke baad sabhi mandap uth jate hai
 Pt on the messing up of traditions krishnadev shukla kehete hai ki mandap kaa mahatv log bhul rahe hai or jane-anjaane main dharmik paramparaon se khilwaad kar rahe hai
 This can lead to miseries in the marital life, but due to lack of time in the overbearing lifestyle, people are looking for alternatives
 shukla ke mutabik, radimaid mandapon kaa upyog parampara ke lihaaj se thik nahin he
 Especially as it is being commercialized, the traditions are being left behind and the pavilions are also becoming part of the Khanapurti

 bijepi sarkaar kaa ye virodh CAA or NRC ko lekar ho rahaa he
 Opposition, students and institutions working on civil liberties have blamed the Narendra Modi government bluntly and said that the government wants to damage the secular structure of the country by manipulating the basic values of the constitution
 pichley saadhe 5 saal main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne lagaataar do baar satta main damdaar vaapasi kii he
 If we talk in terms of votes, then his popularity graph has also increased compared to the last time, but with the popularity of PM, another stream is running parallel and this is the stream of opposition to his government, his party and his ideology

 rohit vemula kii maut par desh bhar main narendra modi sarkaar kaa virodh hua

 What will happen to his family maa bharti ne apana ek laal khoyaa

 Many writers, artists returned their awards in protest against Rohit Vemula's suicide
 essi / asti ectanarendra modi sarkaar ko apane kaarykaal main dalit samaaj kaa bhi virodh jhelana padaa
 In September 2018, the Dalit community staged a massive nationwide protest against the Modi government
 ye viropeessi / estact main kiye gaye badlaav ke khilaaf kiya gaya tha
 In fact, in one case, the Supreme Court while making changes to the SC / ST Act said that no arrest will be made immediately in the cases related to it
 adaalat ne kaha tha ki shikaayat milane ke baad dspi str ke police afasar shuruaati jaanch karenge or jaanch kisi bhi surat main 7 din se zyada samay tak nahin hogi
 DSP will do preliminary investigation to decide whether a case is made according to the complaint or whether it is being framed by making false allegations
 The Dalit community reacted sharply against this change and called for a Bharat Bandh on 2 April 2018
 is band ke dauraan pade paimaane par hinsa hui or 6 logon kii maut ho gai
 Many trucks were burnt
 aakhir dalit samudaay ke virodh ke aage sarkaar ko jhukna padaa or sarkaar ne kanoonee praavdhaan kar essiasti act ke puraane swaroop ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Farmer Movement: Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced the anger of farmers many times during his tenure
 karj ke boj se jujh rahekisansadakon par nikal aae or sarkaar se MSP badhaane samet kai maang ko lekar naaraa buland kiya
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the Central Government introduced the Land Acquisition Bill in Parliament
 iske baad kisaanon main sarkaar ke prati niraashaa kaa bhav paidaa ho gaya
 However, the government had to bow down after intense opposition from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ne is bill ko lekar kaha ki sarkaar ne kisaanon ke gale par kulhadi chalaai he
 There have been many peasant movements in Maharashtra in the last five years
 empi kaa mandsaur bhi kisaanon ke andolan kaa centre rahaa
 6 farmers died in police firing here
 bhartiya kisaan union ne 2018 main vishaal kranti padayatra shuru kii
 This padyatra started in September 2018 from Tikait Ghat in Haridwar
 sitambar 2019 main bhartiya kisaan sanghathan ne bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf padayatra nikaali ye padayatra 11 sitambar ko saharanpur se shuru hui thi
 Apart from this, the farmers kept open the front against the Modi government
 navnirvaachit saansadon ko sambodhit karne se pehle nivartmaan pradhanmantri narendra modi ne samvidhan ke aage maathaa teka
 Modi also repeatedly mentioned the constitution in his address
 modi ne kaha ki aap lau mekar hai
 Whenever you are confused about a decision, there are 2 criteria for it
 pehali kasuti he gandhi, dinadayal, lohia kii vichaardhaara or duusari kasuti he hamaara samvidhan
 He said that there is a difference in the penance of Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 ham kasuti ke in mandandon ko lekar chalem
 At first glance, it appears the faith of the outgoing Prime Minister in the Constitution of the Holy Book of the Republic of India
 vah bhi tab, jab 2014 main pehali baar saansad chune jane ke baad loktantr ke mandir sansad main pravesh karne se purv uski sidhiyon par maathaa teka tha
 What Modi's thinking was behind this, only Modi should know it, but the political implications of this step and his address are also being explored
 virdohi dalon ke prachaar abhiyaan ke centre main samvidhan tha
 The Opposition kept trying to surround the Modi government by calling for the Constitution to be in danger, to save the Constitution, to save democracy
 bihar vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh mahagathbandhan kii aguva argedy ke tejasvi yadav ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan 2019 kii chunavi jang ko samvidhan bachaane kii ladaai bataate hue yahaan tak kah diya tha ki modi sarkaar agar satta main vaapasi karti he to desh main kabhi chunaav nahin honge
 Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also said in India Today Conclave that our fight in UP is to save the Constitution
 sharad yadav, lalu prasad yadav jaise sheersh netaaon ke saath hi congress bhi samvidhan ke mudde par modi sarkaar ko lagaataar gherti rahi
 In such a situation, Modi's attempt to take a plunge in front of the constitution and tell the test is to try to give a message that the allegations against the government are unrestrained and the government is determined to work within the scope of the constitution

 At around 7 o'clock there was a uniformed man wearing a jacket
 inspector ne un yuvakon ko ishaara kiya or phir chaay pine chalaa gaya
 The young man also went from behind
 isi dauraan pehle se vahaan bhesh badalakar khadey patna ke city espi shivadeep lande or unki team ne us vardi vaale ko daboch liya
 In fact, Pankaj and his brother Deepak ran a stationery shop in Patna's Buddha Marg

 There was a crime in Moradabad in UP with this SIM, in which the team of Moradabad police came to Patna in 2012, Pankaj and Deepak were interrogated

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi has refused to submit a copy of her passport in a US court as documentary evidence in a 1984 anti-sikh riot case
 iske liye unhone nijee suraksha or gopneeyata ke aadhaar par bharat sarkaar kii ore se kii gai manaahi kaa hawala diya he
 Last month, US District Judge Brian Cogan asked Sonia Gandhi to give some kind of documentary evidence by 7 April
 taaki adaalat america main unki maujuudagi ko lekar pushti kar sake
 The court's order came in connection with a lawsuit filed by an organization called Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which claimed that Sonia Gandhi was allegedly involved in the city's Memorial Sloan-catering for allegedly conducting her health check-up in September last year
 She had come to the cancer center when summons were sent to her
 sonia ke khilaaf yah maamla is vishay par aadhaarit he ki kya sanghathan ke daawey ke mutabik unhen 9 sitambar ko saman bheja gaya tha or kya vah us samay america main nahin thim, jaisaa ki unhone daawa kiya he
 The SFJ has sought compensation from Sonia for her alleged role in the 1984 riots to save Congress party leaders, including Kamal Nath, Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler, from the trial
 sonia ke atarni ravi batra ne somvaar ko adaalat main kaha ki unki muvakkil ke paas chhipaane ke liye kuch nahin he
 Batra has given the court a letter dated April 5 bearing the signature of Sonia
 jisamen unhone likhaa he ki meri yatraaon kaa khulaasa karne ke sambandh main, jinka vivaran passport par he, bharat sarkaar ne mujhe suchit kiya he ki ve is tarah kii jaankaree kaa khulaasa karne kii ijaajat nahin denge
 Batra said in court that he was informed over the weekend that the Indian government had not allowed 67-year-old Sonia to issue her passport in relation to her personal security and to keep the methods used for her security confidential
 unhone kaha, jis tarah hamaari sarkaar ke sikret sarvice or diplomatic security agenton ko apane tareekon or paddatiyon ko gopneey rakhana jaruri hota he, aisa hi bhartiya adhikariyon ko un logon ke sambandh main karnaa hota he jinaki suraksha kaa prabhaar un par he
 Batra said that Sonia Gandhi is ready to cooperate to resolve the lawsuit filed against her by the organization to the last level, even though she was not in the US

 The people of Delhi have been hit by inflation once again
 petrol teen rupye sasta hua to gaadi waalon kaa safar aasaan hua, lekin jinke paas apni car yaa bike nahin he unke liye dilli main safar karnaa mushkil ho gaya
 The Delhi government has increased auto and taxi fares
 sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad ab dilli main auto kaa meter down hote hi 19 rupee kii jagah pehle do kilometre ke liye 25 rupye dene honge
 Earlier the initial fare was 19 rupees which has increased to 25 rupees
 pehle do kilometre ke baad 19 rupee kaa kiraaya dena padataa tha
 After that, people had to pay 6 rupees 30 paise per kilometer, but now after the increased rate, people will have to pay eight rupees after six and a half
 isi tarah saamaanya taxi kaa kiraaya 11 rupee prati kilometre se badhkar 14 rupee or asi taxi kaa kiraaya 13 rupee prati kilometre se badhkar 16 rupee ho gaya he
 In the past, auto drivers demonstrated at Rajghat against the demand for increase in fare and police harassment

 The country's largest government hospital and medical research institute AIIMS has sent a proposal to increase the retirement age of doctors from 65 to 67, but NDTV India has come to know that this proposal was not only sent in haste, but fixed The process was also ignored and the proposal has angered the AIIMS faculty and the association has strongly opposed the proposal to increase the age
 haalanki, ames ke doctoron kii ritairement kii umr 65 se badhaakar 67 karne kaa prastaav sunne main bada acha lagata he ki anbhavi doctor do saal or yahaan sevaayen denge, lekin swasthya mantri jepi nadda ko ames kii faikalti kii ore se likhi gai chitthee is prastaav ko sawaalon ke ghere main laati he
 a letter to the health minister JP Nadda (a copy of which is with NDTV India) was written on the 19th of this month by the AIIMS Faculty Association
 is chitthee main kaha gaya he ki, 'kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad ames ke kuch senior doctoron kii puure adhikaron ke saath theke par dubaara niyukti karnaa santhaan kii autonomi or kaam karne ke maahaul ke saath samjhauta he'
 But two days after this letter was written, a proposal to increase the retirement age of doctors to two years was sent to the cabinet at the AIIMS important governing and institute body meeting on 21 October
 ames main aaj kareeb 800 doctor hai
 It may be beneficial to stop experienced doctors in AIIMS, but experts say that this proposal to increase the age of retirement of doctors here only benefits a few doctors
 asal main kuch senior doctoron kii ritairement ke baad theke par kii gai niyukti par sawaal uthe to use baad hi ye prastaav cabinet main bheja gaya
 The investigation reveals that after the retirement of Dr
 GK Rath, head of the Department of Radiotherapy Department at AIIMS (who also heads the Rotary Cancer Research Institute of AIIMS and National Cancer Institute), he got a three-year extension on the contract with all rights Direct appointment was made by the Committee of Cabinet
 ames ke kai doctor ise santhaan kii swaittata se samjhauta maan rahe hai
 Only after this, the meeting of two important committees governing body and institute body of AIIMS was held on 21 October
 mana ja rahaa he ki ye baithak kai duusare ritair ho rahe senior doctoron kii phir se niyukti kaa rasta kholane ke liye he, taaki doctoron ke ekstansion ko kanoonee manyata mil sake
 The main questions that are being raised are why the proposal was sent directly to the cabinet without sending it to the Ministry of Finance, HRD and the Ministry of Personnel for consultations
 sach ye bhi he ki prastaav ke paas hone par kai saalon se mahatvapurn vibhaagon ke pramukh ke pad par baithe senior doctor vahiin jame rahenge, jisase yuva doctoron main naaraazgi or hataasha he
 On Wednesday evening, the AIIMS Faculty Association, through a press release, demanded that the retirement age be extended only when the rotation policy for the Heads of Departments is also applicable
 yani tay samay baad echodi badale jaaen
 In its letter, the association said that AIIMS 'highest committees (governing body and institute body) have issued the order in 2012, which needs to be strictly implemented
 is bare main piemo or health ministry ko enditivi india kii ore bheje gaye sawaalon ke jawaab nahin aae, lekin ames ke doctoron ne swasthya mantri ko chitti likhakar ye kaha he ki aise prastaav ko sahmati dena santhaan main doctoron kii netaaon or mantriyon ke saath sathganth ko badhayega
 While it is good to hear the proposal to increase the retirement age of AIIMS doctors from 65 to 67, experienced doctors will serve for two more years, but a letter written by the AIIMS faculty to Health Minister JP Nadda has given this proposal Brings questions
 ames faikalti association yani fames kii ore se health ministar jepi nadda ko ek chitti ( jisaki ek copy enditivi india ke paas he) isi maheene 19 taarikh ko likhi gai
 This letter states that, "after the end of term, the re-appointment of some senior AIIMS doctors on contract with full rights is in agreement with the institute's autonomy and working environment"
 lekin is chitti ke likhe jane ke do din baad hi 21 oktober ko ames kii mahatvapurn gavarning or institute body kii meeting main doctoron kii sevanivritti kii umr do saal badhaane kaa prastaav cabinet ko bhej diya gaya
 AIIMS today has around 800 doctors
 anbhavi doctoron ko ames main rokna phydemand ho saktaa he, lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki yahaan doctoron kii retarment kii umr badhaane kaa ye prastaav chand doctoron ko hi phayda pahunchaata he
 In fact, after the retirement of some senior doctors, questions were raised on the contractual appointment, then the proposal was sent to the cabinet only
 padtaal bataati he ki ames main radiotherapy department ke vibhaagadhyaksh dow jike rath (jo ames ke rotary cancer research santhaan ke pramukh or neshnal cancer santhaan ke bhi pramukh hai) kii sevanivritti ke baad unhen sabhi adhikaron ke saath theke (contract) par teen saal kaa ekstansion sidhe appointment cameti of cabinet ne diya
 Many AIIMS doctors consider this as compromising the autonomy of the institution
 iske baad hi ames kii do mahatvapurn samitiyon gavarning body or institute body kii baithak 21 oktober ko hui
 It is believed that this meeting is to open the way for the re-appointment of many other retired senior doctors, so that the extension of doctors can be given legal recognition
 jo sawaal uth rahe hai unamem pramukh ye he ki prastaav ko vitt mantralay, echaradi mantralay or carmik mantralay ke paas mashvire ke liye bheje bagaiyr hi sidhe cabinet ko kyon bhej diya gaya?tippaniyan The truth is that after the proposal is passed, senior doctors sitting on the post of head of important departments will remain there for many years, due to which there is resentment and frustration in the young doctors

 Actually, this is the first win on the last ball chasing a target in the current IPL
 jabaki ipel main aakhri baar pichley saal pune-kings ilevan punjab ke match main aisa dekha gaya tha
 And both times Mahendra Singh Dhoni did this feat

 He said that these people, who ruled the country for four generations, are hypocritical people who shed tears of crocodile
 saath hi unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par chutki lete hue kaha ki kai baar to panchayat main panch bhi unase acchhee bhashaa kaa prayog karte hue bhaashan de jate hai
 On the matter of lowering of oil prices during the election, Pradhan said that oil prices depend on the international market
 pichley dinon main bazaar kii sthiti ke kaaran hamen tel kii badi hui keemton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The iran-us dispute also increased oil prices
 lekin aaj daam niyantran main hai
 'due to good policy, developed countries also understand our strength' Meanwhile India has succeeded in convincing oil producers
 yahi kaaran he ki bharat jaise kanjuming deshon kii takat viksit desh bhi samajhane lage hai
 It is a result of the correct policy of the Government of India that the Indian currency is reaching a strong position against the dollar
 exise duty main badhotaree par unhone kaha ki kai rajya sarkaron ne isamen kami kii he
 We used the earnings from oil for public welfare schemes
 piem modi ke netritv main hamane garibon, pichhadon or kisaanon ke hit main kaam kiya, unke liye kai yojanaon ko lagu kiya
 When our government came to power, inflation was received in double digit, which was reduced
 hamaari sarkaar ke shuru hote hi daal ke daam tripal disit main the jo abhi niyantran main hai
 The US has said that there will be a special exemption in the case of oil trade with India and Iran
 yah janata kii takat or piem modi kii niti ke kaaran hi sambhav ho sakaa
 On the question of Trump not coming on Republic Day, Pradhan said that some people have phobias
 wo kisi bhi baat ko batangad banaakar pesh karne ke aadi ho chuke hai
 Their nature has become such that they should be left on their condition
 kya jiesti ke daayre main aaenge tel utpaada?kya jiesti ke daayre main petrol dijal aa paaegaa, is sawaal ke jawaab main pradhan ne kaha ki rajyon ko kuch vishyon par swaittata di gai he, dilli (centre) unke sabhi kaamon main dakhal nahin de saktaa
 If two-thirds agree between the two then only this will be applicable
 keval petroleum product nahin balki sabhi utpaadit vastuon par sahamati ke saath hi lagu ho paaegaa
 The public knows that the Modi government is working for them
 tel kii badhati keemton par unhone kaha ki bharat pehla desh he jisane 175 gigawatt vaikalpik eendhan kaa lakshya rakhaa he jisamen 100 gigawatt taiyaar bhi kar liya gaya he
 In response to whether PM Modi can contest from Puri in Odisha, Pradhan said that PM can contest from anywhere in the country
 unka kad or bijepi kaa graph puure desh main sabase teji se aage badhaa he
 This has happened because the country has faith in PM Modi
 odisha main hoga satta parivartanodisha kii apni ek seemaa he
 This time it is clear that there will be a change of power in Odisha
 to kya jeet milane par aap (pradhan) odisha ke mukhyamantri banenge, iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki main aisa nahin maanata
 Our entire focus is on converting people's trust in BJP into votes
 'naidu kii raajnneeti se antiaar ko dukh hota'andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidu kii raajnneeti dekhakar aaj agar kisi ko sabase zyada ksht ho rahaa hoga to wo antiaar ko ho rahaa hoga, jinke naam par naidu ne raajnneeti kii
 The self-respect of NTR and the rise of TDP was against the Congress
 congress ne antiaar ko dhakka markar baahar nikaala tha jiske baad tidipi bani
 non-congress politics began in the country in the 80s
 itnaa sabakuch hone ke baavjood bhi agar naidu ne congress se haath milaayaa to unki raajnneeti unako mubarak ho
 On the upcoming state assembly elections, he said that the issues of both Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections are different
 lekin donon ko desh kii raajnneeti prabhavit karegi
 Attacking the Congress, Pradhan said that what is the politics of today, the way people in the country are trying to spread negative politics today after ruling this country, to reveal their negativity to the public
 To do
 chaahe rajya ke chunaav hon yaa phir centre ke chunaav hon, dobaaraa unke khilaaf janadesh aayega
 In Madhya Pradesh, the election of Raja, Maharaja and industrialist to Congress will be challenging in Madhya Pradesh, on which Pradhan said that elections are challenging
 ham kisi bhi chunaav ko halke main nahin lete hai
 Since the time of Jana Sangh in Madhya Pradesh, people are intact on BJP, we will regain this trust
 unhone kaha ki congress ne madhya pradesh main teen bade chehre ek raja, doosraa maharaja or teesraa udyogpati ko maidan main utaara he
 Will these people worry about the people, their family ruled there for a long time
 lekin unamem se hi ek netaa kah rahe hai ki meraa cheharaa mat lagaao kyonki cheharaa lagane se vot ghat jayega
 Can not fool the public for so long
 'panch bhi rahul se acchhee bhashaa bol lete hai'rahul gandhi par chutki lete hue unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ek badi party ke adhyaksh hai, lekin kai baar to panchayat main panch bhi unase acchhee bhashaa kaa prayog karte hue bhaashan de jate hai
 Opponents should oppose, i have no objection to this, should also challenge fact-based
 'rahul ko kaagaj main likhakar jo pakadaa do wo bol jate hai'rafel par unhone kaha ki jab congress ke paas sasti deal thi to phir use amal main kyon nahin laayaa gaya
 Actually, the Congress bought the empty chassis (structure) of the truck, not Rafael
 modi ji usamen se ek atyaadhunik transportesan whical lekar aae
 Taking a jibe at Rahul, he said that those whose general knowledge is weak, those who write and let them hold in hand, cannot speak
 unki kya baat karen
 The people of the country have understood the trick of misleading them
 loksabhaa chunaav aakankshaon par ladaa jayegaraam mandir par unhone kaha ki yah mudda ek alag vishay he
 Ram is a matter of social faith, but whether or not Ram temple is built or not, the matter is in the court, if there is a rhetoric on it, how did the BJP become responsible
 aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav mandir nahin desh kii aakankshaon par ladaa jayega
 'the creepers who shed crocodile tears in the Congress' See the situation of Rae Bareli who brought Congress to Parliament, how people are forced to live there
 vikaas or rojgaar ke maamle main yaa phir kisi anya vishay par litmus test kar ke dekh lijie pataa chal jayega inhone kya kiya he
 These crocodiles are creepy people who shed tears
 hamane 59 minute main ek karod rupee kaa lone dene kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 'government will be formed in 3 states, BJP will play a decisive role in one' Technological revolution is happening in the country, Industrial Revolution 4

 (click here to see link) pakistan ke hukmran apni sarazamin se aatank or aatankwaad ko khatm karne kaa hameshaa dam bharte hai
 But from there amidst the scorching crops of terror, sometimes the face of Dawood, sometimes Hafiz Saeed, sometimes Masood Azhar and Syed Salauddin is seen
 aise main pakistan ke sabhi daawey khokhale najar aate hai
 Syed Salauddin may have been dubbed by the US as an International Terrorist, but Pakistan insists that he will find them
 abhi zyaada din nahin hue jab hijbul mujahidin ke cheef saiyad salauddin ke maathe par america ne global tebrist kaa tag chaspaan kar diya tha
 And now late in the morning, his terrorist organization Hizbul Mujahideen also came
 jise america ke videsh mantralay ne aatanki sanghathan ghoshit kar diya
 Orders were ordered to seize his properties coming into the American territory
 zaahir he america kaa ye qadam sirf salauddin or uske aatankiyon ke liye hi nahin, balkipakistanke liye bhi nai museebataan lekar aayaa he
 The reason is clear, till now Pakistan has not only declared Salauddin but also his organization of people working for the freedom of Kashmir, but now it has been clear from America's decision that the world has no one to talk about these blatant things Not here aise main sawaal ye he ki akhir america ke is faisale kaa in aatankwaadiyon or unke saraparaston par kya asar hoga, to iskaa jawaab sidhaa sa he ki ab aatank ke girohabaaz ghir chuke hai
 Now it will not be easy for Hizbul to raise funds in the name of Kashmir
 videsh main uske liye kaam karne vaale logon par shikanja kasega or uske khate sil honge
 Hizbul's Chief Salauddin already has a number of restrictions, the property has been seized
 hijbul ke aatankiyon ke khilaaf karrwai main bharat ko abhi or aasaani hogisabhi america nagarikon ke hijbul ke saath sambandhon or len-dein par bhi roak lagegi
 In such a situation, it can be said that these restrictions have undoubtedly come from the US, but this is a big victory for India
 pichhali baar jab piem modi america ja rahe the, to usase mahaz ek rose pehle salauddin ko america ne daagdar qaraar diya tha or ab jab modi se trump kii baat hui uske duusare hi din ye faisalaa aa gaya
 Here Zikre-special is that this decision of US has now put Hizbul in the queue of Al Qaeda, ISIS, boko-haram and other terrorist organizations running from Pakistan like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammad
 
 aise main ab bharat ke liye bhi ye ek acha mauka he ki wo sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke saamne syed salauddin or hijbul mujahidin ko antarrashtriya aatanki or antarrashtriya aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit karwaane kii koshish kare
 Countdown of terrorists from Hindustan to Pakistan and Pakistan to America is on
 fark bas itnaa he ki hindustan or america is ginati ko aage badhanaa chaahate hai jabaki pakistan ise rokna chahta he
 That is why, in the last twenty four hours, there has been a double attack on the terrorists who grew up in Pakistan's ancestors
 ek taraf jahaan america ne hijbul mujahidin par antarrashtriya aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa thappa laga diya he, vahiin duusari taraf ghati main lashkar ke ek or commander ko maut kii neend sula diya gaya
 Terrorists who have spewed poison against India and have experienced bloodshed have suffered two or two blows simultaneously
 ek taraf america ne jahaan hijbul mujahidin ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kar diya, vahiin ghati main suraksha balon ne lashkar e taiyyaba ke ek or commander ko maut kii neend sula diya he
 His name was Ayub Lelhari
 ji haa, wo insaaniyat kaa dushman tha
 But on Wednesday, the same commander of the lashkar-e-taiba, an organization of innocent people in the name of freedom of Kashmir, got caught in the trap of the Indian Army and security forces on Wednesday that it was freed as a corpse

 Before the match between India and Pakistan in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy, the biggest question has become which team will have more pressure? tikat counter par phens kii lambi kataren is baat ke saboot hai ki bharat-paak match ke dauraan bhubaneshwar ke kalinga stadium main darshak khachaakhach bhare rahenge
 The chance that the fans desperately wait for hockey, they have got to see it in the Champions Trophy
 bhubaneshwar ke kalinga stadium main jab donon timen takaraaengi, to ek baat kii guarantee he ki bhartiya team ko darshakon kaa bharpoor saath milegaa or pakistan ke saamne chunauti pehle se kahin zyada hogi
 The most recent picture of Indian victory over Pakistan is of the Asiad final
 asiad final ke is match ko mehmaan team shaayad hi bhul pai ho or bhartiya team yaa phans ise shaayad hi bhoolanaa chahenge
 But the coaches of both teams say that they will keep the emotions of their teams under control

 Dutch coach Rolant Oltmans, of the Indian team, says, "we will keep the emotions of the players under control
 ye hockey kaa khel he or match main holland, belgium yaa pakistan kii team ho, hamaare liye ek hi baat he
 i have also been a coach of Pakistan, so i know both teams very well
 udhar, pakistan ke coach shahanaz shaikh kehete hai ki bhubaneshwar ke darshak achche hai
 These fans understand hockey
 lekin unhen lagata he ki donon mulkon ke match main dabaav mejabaan par hota he, isliye dabaav bharat par hi hoga
 The captains of both teams realize that the importance of the match has increased with each other facing each other in the semi-finals

 He says, "all the players are experienced
 ham plan ke hisaab se hi khelenge
 " pakistan ke captain mohammad imran bhi kehete hai ki unki team pressure main aakar nahin khelegi
 He says he will try to win by trying to play his game
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ko is baat kaa bhi ilm he ki pakistan is match ko asiad ke badale ke taur par le saktaa he, lekin holland or belgium ke khilaaf jeet se team ke hausale buland hai
 Dharamvir Singh, who became the man of the match by scoring in the match against Belgium, says that if it is saying a revenge match, then nothing happens, saying that the one who plays well will win
 bhartiya team ke golkeeper or upakptain piaar srijesh aatmavishvaas se bhare hue hai

 sarkaar ne chaar saal se adhik samay se gehun niryaat par lage pratibandh ko hataane kaa nirnay kiya he
 However, given the softening of prices in the global market, the prospects of exporting wheat from India are not very good at the moment
 sarkaar ne gharelu mahangaai ko dekhte hue 2007 ke shuru main gehun ke niryaat par pabandi laga di thi
 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said on Saturday, yes, now export is not banned

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne abhi yah ghoshnaa nahin kii he ki kitne gehun kaa niryaat kiya jayega, kyonki antarrashtriya bazaar main isaki keemten neeche chal rahi hai
 It is noteworthy that the Empowered Group of Ministers, headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, has given in-principle consent to open wheat exports
 yah nirnay bhandar kii behatar sthiti ko dekhte hue kiya gaya he
 Pawar expressed doubts over the possibility of export of wheat from India at present, given the situation in the international market
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin lagata he ki kahin se koi harakat hogi
 The question is whether we will be able to sell the goods on the low price going on in the international market
 krushimantri ne kaha ki bhandaaran kii samasya bad rahi he
 He said that at this time we have more than necessary stores in the godown
 aise main meri vaastavik chintaa he ki jab andhra pradesh or punjab main dhan kii kharid shuru hogi, to use rakhane kaa kya intjaam hoga

 6 karod ton hua he, jo ki ek record he
 Wheat production 8 in the previous year
 08 karod ton tha
