 bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (ISRO) ne 15 july ko apane moon mishan kii lonching ko tay samay 2
 56 from 51 AM
 24 minute pehle roak di thi
 ISRO was told that the launch is being stopped due to technical flaws
 agar yah takneekee khami pataa na chalati to kya hota? bahubali rocket jieselvi-emke3 chandrayan ko lekar ud jaataa to kya hota? kya rocket aisi sthiti main ud paata? udata to kitni dur ja paata? aaie jaanate hai aise kai sawaalon ke jawaab
 
 
 The reason for postponing the launch was the helium leak vehicle located between the cryogenic stage and the Chandrayaan-2
 isamen hota he cmand gas bottle
 The mission had to be stopped due to helium leakage inside it
 bottle main helium kaa pressure level ban nahin rahaa tha
 It was reduced from 330 points to 300, then to 280 and finally to 160
 isliye launch ko rokna padaa
 On 22 June, there was a leakage problem in the oxygen tank during the ground test
 lekin use sudhaar diya gaya tha
 Launching could not be done in four days, then 3 months will be postponed Chandrayaan-2 What would happen next if the flaws were ignored and the rocket launched
 prithvi kii tay kaksha se bhatak jaataa chandrayan-2kareeb 15 minute 97 second par jieselvi-emke3 rocket cryogenic stage band hota
 The launch vehicle here would have been different from the cryogenic stage with Chandrayaan-2
 tab isaki oonchai kareeb 176
 Would have been 38 km
 agle 25 second main 182 kimi kii oonchai par chandrayan-2 launch whical se alag hota
 But Chandrayaan-2 would have wandered in any orbit of the Earth between altitude of 176 km to 182 km
 use uski nirdhaarit kaksha main laane ke liye kaaphi mehnat kerani padati
 Much of the fuel of Chandrayaan-2 would have been lost
 2
 Chandrayaan-2 had to make five revolutions in an elliptical orbit around the earth in the normal state of the moon's deteriorating condition
 prithvi kii kaksha main bhatakane ke baad use waapas tay kaksha main laayaa jaataa tab bhi use paanch chakkar lagaana padataa lekin in sab ke bich chand ke liye tay rasta badal jaataa
 Chandrayaan-2 had to struggle a lot to get it to travel to the moon
 isse chand kii yatra ke dauraan duuri bad jaati
 The moon is far away
 
 
 antim samay main Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching taalane ke peeche ye he kaaran3
 If Chandrayaan-2 had reached the moon, what would have happened if ISRO scientists had succeeded in bringing Chandrayaan-2 to the moon, then there would not have been enough fuel left in Chandrayaan-2 to complete the five rounds around the moon
 agar chakkar puraa karke vikram lander or pragyan rover chand kii sataha par utar jate to nirdhaarit samay tak mishan ko puraa nahin kar pate
 What kind of reward? Before Chandrayaan-2, the government cut the salary of ISRO scientists 4
 chand tak pahunchane ke baad kam ho jaati chandrayan-2 kii liflinechaand kii sataha par vikram lander or pragyan rover chand kii sataha par to utar jate lekin unki lifline kam ho jaati
 The biggest problem is due to less fuel in the orbiter
 vah ek saal tak chand kaa chakkar nahin laga paata
 Also, it would have been difficult to get the data received from Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover to Earth
 helium kaa pressure kam hota rahata to visphot kar jaataa cryogenic injanjis helium li kii baat kii ja rahi he, vah cryogenic ingine main maujuud liquid oxigen or hydrogen ko launch ke baad thanda rakhata he
 If helium leaked, the liquid oxygen and hydrogen present in the cryogenic engine after launch could not be kept cool after launch
 aise main cryogenic ingine garm hokar visphot kar jaataa
 In this situation, two conditions were formed
 pehali visphot ke prabhaav se chandrayan-2 overshut kar jaataa
 That is, he would go into space at a fast speed
 aise main isro usase sampark nahin kar paata or niyantran kho detaa
 The second would have been that Chandrayaan-2 would also have come to an end due to the explosion
 sabase bada nuksaan
 
 
 If this mission is not stopped at the right time, then 11 years of hard work of ISRO scientists in developing Chandrayaan-2's orbiter, rover and lander would have gone in vain
 isamen wo paanch saal bhi shaamil hota jisamen spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad samet un centres ke vaigyanikon kii din-raat kii mehnat bekaar jaati jinhone chandrayan-2 ke saare pelod banaae
 At the same time it would have been a loss of 1000 crores rupees

 com / kbv7nuvoqe Thousands of farmers protested and threw around 250 tractor potatoes on the road in Disa town of Gujarat
 ye kisaan aalu kii banpar paidaavaar ke baad daam girane se pareshaan hai
 In these days, potato prices have come down to Re 1 per kg
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaar unke is sankat kaa samaadhaan nahin nikaal rahi isliye unhone aisa kadam uthaaya he
 Farmers also shouted slogans against the Modi government during the demonstration
 kuch din pehle punjab ke jalandhar main bhi kisaanon ne isi tarah kaa pradarshan kiya tha
 Delhi Metro is in the process of finalizing its Phase III plan and has been expanded a bit further by adding a few more residential, business and educational places in addition to the previously planned locations
 dilli metro rail nigam ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki tisare charan main metro line main 30 kilometre kaa vistaar kiya jayega
 The biggest expansion of the newly added stations will be Jamia Milia Islamia, this expansion from Nehru Place to Jamia Milia Islamia will also cover the outer ring and Kalkaji
 iske alaava isamen kalindi kunj se noida ke botanical garden tak bhi line kaa vistaar kiya jayega

 And it can be completed by March 2016
 is vistaar ke saath hi dilli metro rajdhani kii 70 fisadi aabaadi tak pahunch jaaegi or aasapaas ke kshetra faridabad tathaa noida, aadi ko bhi jod legi
 Sreedharan said that earlier 70-km railway line was proposed in the third phase, which has been increased to 104 km at the request of the Delhi government
 tisare charan par april main kaam shuru hoga
 Sreedharan said that currently 15 lakh passengers are riding on the Delhi Metro, making the Metro 2 daily
 75 karod rupee kaa rajasav aa rahaa he
 After the completion of the third phase, 30 lakh people will start traveling from the metro, due to which the metro will start earning revenue of five crore rupees daily
 unhone kaha ki tisare charan kaa kaam puraa hone ke baad chauthe charan par kaam shuru kiya jayega
 Despite two terrorist attacks in the city in 2011, Delhi Police Commissioner BK Gupta claimed that the police force was successful in controlling crime in the national capital
 police mukhyalay main nav varsh ke maukey par varisht afasaron tathaa mediakarmiyon ke samagam kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue gupta ne daawa kiya ki shahar main aparaadh dar main kami ai he
 He said that we were successful in reducing crimes in the city
 mukhya chunauti kanoon vyavastha ko lekar thi or mujhe yah kehete hue khushi he ki hamane chunauti ko safaltaapurvak puraa kiya
 Two terrorist attacks took place outside the High Court on 25 and 13 September in Delhi
 pehle visphot main koi nahin maaraa gaya lekin duusare hamale main ek darjan se adhik logon kii maut ho gayi
 The city police also had to deal with the hunger strike of yoga guru Baba Ramdev against Anna Hazare and black money on the Lokpal issue last year
 duniya main na jane aisi kitni misaalen hai jab kadradaanon ne karodon rupee kii paintings kharidin lekin dilli main videsh se laai gai takreeban 4 karod rupye kii pating lene jab uskaa ek kadradaan courier company kii daftar pahunchaa, to vahaan pehle se pulisavaale uskaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Do you know why? Because death was hidden in this painting
 paintig kharidne vaala shaksadilli main england se ai ek painting ko risive karne pahunchaa tha
 But as soon as the painting came in his hand, he suddenly found himself surrounded by policemen
 darasal ye koi maamuli painting nahin thi
 Rather it was worth four crores of rupees
 darasal duniya main drugs kii taskari karne waalon ne kanoon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye anekon tareeke ijad kar rakhe hai or aanevaale dinon main bhi na jane kitne nae tareeke aane vaale hai lekin is kadi main is vakt suraksha agenciyon ke hathdrugs kii taskarika jo sabase nayaa or sabase chaunkaane vaala tarika haath laga he, wo apane aap main jitna khatarnaak he, utana hi ajeeb
 The painting sent via the cargo plane flies to one of the world's busiest airports - Heathrow Airport in England - to a cargo plane Hindustan
 saamaanon se bhare se is plane main ek choti, magar aisi khataranaak chiz chuphi he, jiskaa intjarhindustan kii pulicebhi kar rahi he
 The plane reached the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, that is, traveling about 9 hours
 khufia agenciyon kii nigahen flite par thim lekin jis cheez kii talash unhen thi vah hasil karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The next few hours the thing is taken out of the flight and delivered to the office of a courier company, but before the courier company is able to forward its delivery, the Narcotics Control Bureau ie NCB officers come in the middle
 chhapemari kar wo us cheez ko baraamad karte hai or phir uski delivery lene aae shaks ko bhi daboch lete hai
 When the cover of the painting is broken, it is nothing but a special kind of flex painting when seen from the open pole
 jise dekh kar kisi ko bhi iske decorative item hone kaa hi gumaan ho saktaa he, lekin jab enasibi ke officer is flex painting ke saath lage lakdi ke border kaa upree cover todate hai, wo hakeekat saamne aa jaati he, jisaki talash main police landan se lekar dilli tak isflex painting par nigahengadaaye baithi he or ye cheez he khatarnaak drug cocaine
 The price of this consignment of cocaine is more than Rs 4 crores in the international market
 ek khufia soochna par drug ke dhandhebaajon kaa peechha karti hui narcotics control beuro yani enasibi ke afasar us cansinatment tak bhi pahunch gaye, jisamen drug chipa kar englad se bhijwaya gaya tha or us shaks tak bhi, jo hindustan main is cansinmant ko risive karanevaala tha
 In other words, so far this operation seemed to be sitting on its target
 lekin is oparation kii asli kamyaabi is baat par hi tay thi ki baraamad cansinmant se aakhir kitna or koun se drug kii khep baraamad hoti he
 It was also difficult to guess
 The black border in painting is so strong and beautiful that it was difficult to guess that it can be hidden inside but as soon as this panel is broken with the help of a screw driver and a hammer , Inside the tape is seen a special thing of white color
 is safed cheez kii ek jhalak maanon ko enasibi ke afasaron ke hausale ko duuna kar detii he
 As per expectation, consignment of white powder is recovered from inside each panel
 ye safed powder kuch or nahin balki super fine cocaine kii wo khep he, jise trinidad and tobago se england ke raste yahaan tak bhijwaya gaya he
 Search of such goods remains, according to the NCB, now such investigations are done very strictly at all the international airports, instead of carrying the consignment of drugs with them by courier itself, they are transported from one place to another via courier
 Sending is considered more favorable because in such a situation there is no risk of getting caught hands and hands and the goods reach easily from one place to another
 
 jaankaron kii maane to dhandhebaaj hameshaa caveties yani chhedwali chizon kii talash main rahete hai, jinamein chipa kar drug ek jagah se duusari jagah tak aasaani se bhijwa diya jaataa he
 Then whether the hole is in the embroidery of a lehenga, in the shoe sole or in any part of the body
 kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata main congress party ne mosul ko lekar sansad ke bheetar or baahar doharaapan dikhaaya or ochhi raajnneeti kii
 Sushma Swaraj spoke about the tragic murders in the Rajya Sabha about 39 Indians killed in Mosul, Iraq, but at the behest of Congress party Rahul Gandhi, a deadlock was created in the Lok Sabha and they made a loud noise, due to which they did not keep their point here Could aise samvedansheel vishay ke bare main unhone apni samvedanheenata dikhaai he
 Anant Kumar says that if anyone should apologize, it is the Congress who showed such insensitivity
 unhone kaha ki hamaare 39 naagarik vikat paristhitiyon main vahaan the
 The whole country was concerned about their safety and security in Mosul
 jab tak desh ke saamne sarkaar ke saamne thos saboot nahin aa jate, tab tak ham kuch bol nahin sakate the
 But the Congress has deviated from its goal
 is maamle par rahul gandhi or congress ko maafee maangani chahie
 On the other hand, on the issue of giving minority status to Lingayat, Anant Kumar says that the Congress government of Karnataka has tried to divide the society
 2013 main manmohan singh ne lingayat ko alag dharm maanane se alpsankhyak darja dene se inkaar kiya tha
 Then that proposal was rejected, but on this day Siddaramaiah and Rahul Gandhi completely reversed
 unhone congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki apni raajnneetik roti sekane ke liye jatiyon main bhi desh or samaaj ko baantne kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai, lekin ye log kaamyaab nahin honge
 They will have to reverse
 iskaa khamiyaja chunaav main congress or rahul gandhi ko bhugatna padegaa
 Lingayat society is an integral part of the vast Hindu society
 hindu samaaj ko todane kii congress koshish kar rahe hai
 Vote Bank Politics is doing Siddaramaiah at the behest of Rahul Gandhi
 mosul main maare gaye bharatiyon par centre sarkaar ko jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri faruk abdulla kaa saath mil gaya he
 On this, Abdullah says that the statement made by Sushma Swaraj on the slain Indians should not be politicized
 abdulla kaa kahana he ki sushamaa swaraj ne kaha he ki jab tak unke paas saboot nahin hai vah koi bayaan nahin de sakate the
 That is exactly what he said
 farrukh abdulla kaa kahana ki maare gaye bharatiyon ko lekar hamen dukh he, lekin unke pariwaron ke liye unke liye kaam karnaa he
 Whatever was to be done, if you accuse anyone in it, it will not help
 desh ko aage chalanaa he
 The country has to fight against such forces which have done this disgusting act

 kyonki ab bijepi sahyogi dalon kii sharten maanane ke liye baadhya nahi he

 But now the situation has changed

 During the hearing, the court was informed that appeals seeking anticipatory bail of Vadra and Arora are pending in a lower court for hearing at 2 pm today

 On this, the bench was told that the lower court has given interim relief to both of them from arrest
 idi kaa pratinidhitiv adhivaktaa di pi singh or amit mahajan bhi kar rahe hai
 The agency said that Vadra did not approach the court with honesty and that he has hidden the facts
 wadra ne piemele kanoon kii dhara teen (dhanshodhan kaa aparaadh), 17 (talaashi evam jabti), 19 (giraftaar kaa adhikaar), 24 (sabooton kaa jimmaa), 44 (vishesh adaalat main sunwaayee vaale aparaadh) or 50 (saman jari karne, dastavej pesh karne or saboot dene aadi ke bare main adhikariyon kii shaktiyon) ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit karne kii maang kii he

 congress ne somvaar ko 2ji spectrum aavanton ke mudde par sansad kii loklekha samiti ke samaksh upasthit hone kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii peshkash ko ucch naitikta ke udhaaharan ke rup main rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 When asked about the Prime Minister's offer, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said, "the Prime Minister has said that he has nothing to hide
 rajg or khaskar bhaajapa yah bhram failaane main lagi he ki sarkaar isliye jepisi kii maang nahin maan rahi he kyonki pradhanmantri uske samaksh upasthit hone se khud bachanaa chaahate hai
 Ahmed said that the Prime Minister has taken the initiative himself to appear before the PAC, headed by senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi
 agar bhaajapa ko apane netaa joshi kii kshamta par vishwaas nahin he to ham kya kar sakate hai
 Raising the issue of corruption in bjp-ruled Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, the Congress spokesperson said that these issues are not discussed so the BJP is trying to avoid making excuses to the JPC
 unhone kaha ki iske viparit congress ne jab bhi uske netaaon par aarope lage unke khilaaf karrwai kii or aarope sabit hone kaa intjaar nahin kiya
 After Rahul Gandhi's resignation, some Congress mlas in Bihar have demanded the resignation of Legislature Party leader Tejashwi Yadav, taking responsibility for the defeat in Bihar on the same lines
 yah maang karne waalon main congress vidhayak rajesh kumaar pramukh hai
 But the RJD has rejected this demand
 argedy ke vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki tejasvi yadav ke istife kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Meanwhile, it was reported in some channels that Tejashwi Yadav has also offered to resign
 lekin rajd ke hi sutron kaa kahana he ki patna aane ke baad bhi jab tejasvi yadav ne vidhayakon kii koi baithak bulaai he to yah istife kii peshkash kaa sawaal kahaan hota he
 And if they had to offer resignation, then after the election results, there was a meeting of mlas and senior party workers and leaders, in which they could offer resignation
 lekin aisa kuch hua nahin
 Some RJD mlas say that the resignation of Tejashwi Yadav wants to take over the reins of the party after the election defeat
 unki koshish he ki lalu yadav agar party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh nahin to kam se kam kaaryakari adhyaksh unhen bana den
 But of course, whether they are senior leaders of the Tea Party or mlas, the manner in which Tejashwi Yadav has been absent in the party's activities and assembly session, then the RJD leaders also seem defenseless in the face of opposition
 pakistan ke purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf varsh 2007 main purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii hatya ke maamle main shaamil sandigdhon kii sunwaayee kar rahi aatankwaad nirodhi adaalat ke samaksh pesh nahin hue
 After this, he has been summoned to appear in the next hearing on 23 April
 rawalpindi kii adiala jail main band kamare main hui sunwaayee ke dauraan nyaayadhish choudhary habib ur rahamaan ne musharraf samet sabhi aropiyon ko agali sunwaayee ke liye saman bheja
 Musharraf has been summoned twice by the court, but he did not appear in Saturday's hearing
 isse pehle isi adaalat ne musharraf ko faraar ghoshit kiya tha or hatya kii jaanch kar rahe jaanchakartaaon se sahyog nahin karne par unke khilaaf ek giraftaar warrant jari kiya tha
 After issuing summons against the accused, the judge adjourned the case till April 23
 gauratlab he ki benazir bhutto kii 27 disambar, 2007 ko chunavi sabha main hatya kar di gai thi
 Even though many countries should play feud on the political stage of the world, this enmity also has some principles
 khaskar jahaan sawaal insaani jaan kaa ho
 But this does not apply to Pakistan held by army and jihadis
 yahi vajah he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko bagaiyr pukhta saboot, band daravaajon ke peeche sena ke generalon ne maut kaa farmaan suna diya
 However, Prime Minister Modi has directed the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs to give a strong reply to this action of Pakistan
 videsh mantralay bhi kah chukaa he ki agar jadhav ko faansee hoti he to bharat ise sochaa-samajha katl maanegaa
 But the question remains whether there is a way to save Jadhav's life? One look at some such options: pleading in international court? Kulbhushan Jadhav was not allowed to meet the Indian embassy officials, bypassing all international customs
 Has gone
 haalanki pichley ek saal main bharat iske liye pakistan se darjanon baar anurodh kar chukaa he
 Sartaj Aziz, the foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, told the Pakistani Senate last year that there was no strong evidence against Jadhav, so the government was not able to complete the dossier on the issue
 itnaa hi nahin, pakistan main iran ke rajdoot is daawey ko 100 fisadi jhooth bataa chuke hai ki jadhav ro ke jasoos the
 These are some of the points that India can take up with the Hague in the International Criminal Court
 lekin ye pakistan ke saath aapasi rishton ko antarrashtriya dakhal se dur rakhane kii bhartiya niti se mail nahin khayega
 So this is unlikely
 kaidiyon main adla-badali?sheet yuddh ke charam par ek duusare ko phooti aankh naa suhane vaale soviet rus or america bhi jasuson kii adla-badali karte rahe hai
 India and Pakistan have also been releasing prisoners on similar lines
 trek-tu diplomasi ke jariye dilli or islamabad aisi hi kisi sahmati tak pahunch sakate hai
 But even if the Nawaz Sharif government agrees to this, the Pakistani army will allow it, it does not seem so
 lambii kanoonee prakriya kaa sahaara?pakistani kanoon ke mutabik court marshall ke jariye sajayaftaa mujrim civil court main faisle par punarvichaar kii apil kar sakate hai
 Their last option is to plead with the President
 kulbhushan jadhav ke paas ye vikalp khulaa he
 India can also provide a lawyer for this
 kaam karegaa antarrashtriya dabaav?pakistani sena bhale hi apni sarkaar kii naa sunati ho, lekin america or soudi arab jaise madhya-purv ke deshon kaa dabaav paak generalon par aksar kaam karata he
 India's relations with these countries are strong
 sarkaar ke paas ek vikalp in sarkaron ke jariye pakistani sena ko is faisle ko palatney ke liye majaboor karnaa bhi he

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kah rahi he ki unhen ofaset partner kaa pataa nahin he, lekin process main saaf he ki bina rakshaamantri kii anumati ke ofaset tay nahin ho saktaa he
 To change the offset, the government changed the rules and implemented them immediately

 Within 17 days, Reliance was given a license for land, defense manufacturing

 BJP MP MJ Akbar has clarified the allegations of rape by Indian journalist Pallavi Gogoi settled in America
 akbar ne kaha ki kareeb 24 saal pehle ham donon sahmati ke saath relationships main the or yah kai maheenon tak chalaa
 He said that there was a lot of talk about our relationship even after that there was discord in my domestic life about it
 haalanki baad main relationships shaayad kharaab mode par khatm ho gaya
 MJ Akbar said that those who have worked with me and know me can testify this
 wo log bhi bataa sakate hai ki jab pallavi mere saath kaam karti thim tab kya unpar kisi tarah kaa koi dabaav tha
 Former Minister of State for External Affairs MJ Akbar said that the articles written by Pallavi Gogoi in the Washington Post, which have made allegations of rape and violence against me, are completely wrong
 unhone kaha ki ye ghatana kareeb 23 saal puraani he or meri ore se iskaa khandan kiya ja chukaa he
 Akbar said that on October 29, the Washington Post sent questions related to this incident to my lawyer
 lekh ko padhane ke baad mere liye sachai or tathyon ko saamne laana jaruri tha
 Pallavi made the allegations, according to Pallavi Gogoi's statement published in the Washington Post, that Akbar was with Pallavi at a hotel in Jaipur to discuss the news
 jahaan hotel ke kamare main unhone pallavi kaa rape kiya
 There was a lot of hand-cropping between the two but Pallavi writes, 'I struggled a lot, but he was stronger than me physically
 unhone mere kapade faad die or meraa rape kiya
 'pallavi Gogoi, a us-based journalist, has mentioned the incident of rape with her while working at the Asian Age when MJ Akbar used to be her boss
 pallavi ne bataaya ki police main shikaayat karne ke bajaay mujhe zyada jillat mahasoos ho rahi thi
 i did not tell anyone about this, would anyone trust me? i considered myself guilty, why did i go to the hotel room? Earlier, referring to another incident in 1994, Pallavi said, "I went to his office and the door of the room was closed
" maine unhen o-ped pej dikhaaya or bataaya ki kaise isaki hedlins or rochak banaai hai
 Akbar praised my efforts and immediately caught me to kiss
 iske baad mere cheharaa shame se laal ho gaya, maine apni ek sahyogi ko is puure ghatana ke bare main bataaya
 ' rohingya muslimon ne centre sarkaar ke jawaab par supreme court main halafanama daakhil kiya he
 In the affidavit, the Central Government's claim has been dismissed as baseless
 yachikakarta rohingya muslim salimullah or anya ne halafname main kaha ki unka islamic state yaa kisi anya aantki sanghathan se koi rishta nahin he
 The affidavit states that Rohingyas are peace loving people and far from terrorist activities, they are also not involved in criminal activities
 centre sarkaar ke waapas bhejne ke faisle se rohingya kii jaan khatre main pad gai he kyonki myanmar main unhen torchar kiya jayega or hatya bhi kii ja sakati he
 The affidavit also mentions the statement made by Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti in the assembly in which Mehbooba has said that there is no case against Rohingya
 yahaan tak ki srilanka ke naagarik ke maamle tamilnadu main baqayda cameti he jo ye jaanch karti he kiske littey se sambandh hai yaa aapraadhik ricard he
 Such people are kept in special camps

 That is why Rohingya have come to India after saving their lives
 vahaan unki hatya kii ja rahi he or ghar jala die gaye hai
 Therefore, they are not just illegal migrants, but they should be protected according to many international treaties signed by the Government of India
 unke waapas bhejne par roak lagaai jaani chahie
 Even in the case of Sri Lankan citizens, there is a committee in Tamil Nadu which investigates who has links with the LTTE or has a criminal record
 aise logon ko special camp main rakhaa jaataa he
 The citizens of India look at the Rohingya with pity while the Myanmar army tortures
 isi kaaran rohingya jaan bachaakar bharat aae hai
 They are being murdered there and houses burnt
 isliye wo sirf avaidh pravasi nahin hai balki unhen bharat sarkaar dwaara sin kii gai kai antarrashtriya sandhiyon ke mutabik sarankshan diya janaa chahie

 maharashtra ke jalgaanv ke rajendra shahu bade utsaah ke saath tirthayatra par nikle the, lekin unka sara utsaah uttarakhand main aakar kafoor ho gaya
 In fact, these days roads in the state are getting jammed everywhere and there is a huge lack of basic facilities
 rajendra bataate hai, ''yahaan na to jam ne hamaara peechha choda, na hi mandiron main lagi lambii linon ne
 "pravin, who came to Uttarakhand from Indore in Madhya Pradesh, had the experience of traveling to Char Dham
 bhannaae rajendra or praveen ne musuri, nainital or haridwar kii saiyr kaa apana kaarykram bich main hi chhod diya
 Not only Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh also has more or less similar situations
 tirthayatra or paryaton sijan main, haridwar ho yaa nainital, yaa phir chardhaam yatra, uttarakhand main har root jam se halkaan he
 In many places, due to the huge crowd of tourists, basic arrangements like health, medical, drinking water, transport, accommodation and toilets have collapsed
 isse sailaani behaal hai
 This time the supply of diesel and petrol in Joshimath and Uttarkashi was overrun by the crowds
 rojaanaa kareeb 10-10,000 tirthayatri yamunotri or gangotri dham pahunch rahe hai
 Uttarkashi is the largest stoppage of passenger vehicles due to the presence of two major pilgrimages of Chardham Yatra in Uttarkashi district

 At the same time, money is not available to the passengers at most bank atms on the travel route in Joshimath

 Not only this, the hotel operators also started to increase the room rent arbitrarily due to the rush of tourists

 By June 12 this year, 18,56,490 pilgrims had reached various dhams of Uttarakhand
 mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ke anusaar, is varsh anumaan se bahut zyada shraddhalu or paryatak rajya main aae hai
 The government sees the increasing number of tourists as a good opportunity, but there is a need to develop infrastructure and other tourism facilities accordingly
 uttarakhand ke mukhya sachiv ne jiladhikariyon ko kamiyon ko dur karne ke nirdesh die hai
 But obviously, the government does not seem very serious about this
 himachal pradesh main bhi sailaaniyon kii bheed is kadar umad rahi he ki paryatak sthalon kii sadaken bhi kam pad gayi
 Hotels are not only short of accommodation in Shimla, Manali and Dharamshala, but the trains of tourists coming here are barely moving towards their destination
 rajdhani shimla ko chhodkar kullu, manali, dharmashala or maclodganj main trephic samasya se paryatak hi nahin balki sthaneey bascindia bhi khaasaa pareshaan hai
 Even small cities are unable to handle the burden of vehicles
 shimla main may-june main saamaanya sthiti se teen guna zyada gadibhan ho gai hai, jabaki yahaan parking kii jagah hi nahin he
 Locals park vehicles on the road and there is no place for vehicles outside
 shahar main vaikalpik maarg bhi nahin he, isliye puraa dabaav circular road par he
 Fourlane work is going on from Kalka to Shimla
 is kaaran solan police ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 However, Deputy Commissioner Shimla Amit Kashyap has himself taken up the task to deal with the situation in Shimla
 paryatakon kii sankchaya ko dekhte hue trephic vyavastha sanbhaalane ke liye unhone 100 pulicekarmi tainaat kiye hai
 Traffic riders are patrolling all day from Shoghi to Shimla
 subah 8 se raat 10 baje tak pikup kii entry band kar di gai he
 They themselves are checking the situation by visiting schools
 iske alaava upayukta shimla ne yah bhi nirdesh die hai ki sadak ke kinare khadey vaahanon kaa tatkaal chaalaan kar diya jaae
 The arrangements that have taken place in Shimla are not in Kullu, Manali and mcleodganj
 vahaan paryatak pareshaan hai or gadibhan 3 se 4 ghante tak jam main reng rahi hai
 The situation is even worse in Rohtang
 engiti ne shimla, dharmashala or manali jaise paryatak sthalon par nirmaan par roak laga di he
 Therefore, no one can build a new hotel now and in such a situation, the rooms for the stay have become less
 vahiin jo helitaxi chalaai thi, vah bhi mahaj chhalaava sabit hui
 Halitaxi is not working right now, so all the pressure is on cars and roads
 vahiin, shimla main kai ton bikharaa kachra nigam kii karypranali kii pole khol rahaa he
 Overall, Shimla, built for a population of 50,000, cannot carry the burden of 300,000 people
 garmiyon ke dinon main pichley varsh shimla main pani kii dikkat ai thi
 However, this time Chief Minister Jairam Thakur has reinstated, but he is currently on a tour of Europe
 unki gairmaujuudagi kii vajah se nichle str par kuch kotahi dikh rahi he, maano ve bhi garmi se pareshaan hon
 No special efforts have been made by the tourism department especially for the tourists
 badog ho yaa peterhof yaa phir shimla; in paryatak sthalon se behatar sevaayen vibhaag ke bajaae nijee hotel vyavsaayee de rahe hai
 Obviously, while people are turning to these hill states in large numbers for relief from heat or for pilgrimage, the government here has not been able to make proper arrangements for them
 natijatan, donon rajyon ke halaat charmara gaye hai or keval bahari sailaani hi nahin balki sthaneey bascindia bhi isse halkaan hai

 'iske baad ek yuvak ne unase sawaal poochta he ki pavaar ne is ilaake main do maheene main pani ke pipeline bichaane kii baat kahi thi par aaj aath saal biit gaye
 Angered by the question, Pawar's supporters misbehaved with the young man
 yuvak kaa kahana tha he ki use jawaab maangane kaa haq he
 After this, Pawar ordered his supporters to take the young man from there

 The news of the Food Corporation of India crumbling has started coming
 isi ke zarie bharat sarkaar kisaanon se anaaj karidati he
 The government in turn gives money to the corporation in what we know as the subsidy bill
 2016 tak to bhartiya khaadya nigam ko sabsidi sarplus main milti thi
 More than i wanted
 lekin 2016-17 main jab use chahie tha ek lakh 10 hazaar karod to mila 78000 karod
 The remaining 32,000 crore was borrowed from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF)
 jis tarah se bharat sarkaar reserve bank kii bachat se paise lene lagi he usee tarah se nigam yah kaam pehle se kar rahaa tha
 As required, NSSF started taking loans
 nateeja 2016-17 kaa vitt varsh samaapt hote hi NSSF se liya gaya karza 70,000 karod kaa ho gaya
 The same thing happened in the year 2017-18
 nigam ko chahie tha ek lakh 17 hazaar karod to sarkaar ne diya 62,000 karod
 Then 55000 crore loan was taken from NSSF
 is tarah 2017-18 ke ant tak lone ho gaya ek lakh 21 hazaar karod
 It increased to one lakh 91 thousand crores by the end of the year 2018-19
 bharat sarkaar kii ek unit par kareeb do lakh karod kaa karz he
 Apart from this, the corporation has taken loans from many places
 kul milakar do lakh 40 hazaar karod lone ho jaataa he
 From 2019-20, the corporation will have to pay the principal amount
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki 46000 karod lone chukaana hoga
 Because of this, what will happen to the NSSF, because even the public money is there, its analysis has not been read yet
 bada kaaran yah bataaya gaya ki sarkaar sabsidi ke tahat chaaval or gehun ke daam nahin badhaati he
 Rice gives three rupees per kg and wheat two rupees per kg
 agar ek rupaya prati kilo bhi badha diya jaae to saal main 5000 karod kii aay ho sakati he
 But in front of the scale of loan, it is nothing but 5000 crores
 sarkaar ek kilo chaaval par 30 rupee or gehun par 22
 45 gives a subsidy of Rs
 2016 se 2018 ke dauraan sarkaar bajet main khaadya sabsidi ke liye jo paisa ghoshit karti thi uskaa aadha se adhik hi de paati thi
 Apparently, the government's economic situation was starting to crumble during the time of demonetisation
 ise chhipaane ke liye bajet main ghoshit paisa nahin diya gaya or nigam se kaha gaya hoga ki NSSF yaa kahin se lone lekar bharpai karen
 Now the corporation has owed more than three lakh crores
 jisamen do lakh 40 hazaar karod kaa sirf lone he
 Will it affect farmers? This is the condition of a large organization of the government which claims its performance

 Another report has appeared in Business Standard that 90 percent of companies in the manufacturing sector will not get any benefit from the cut in corporate tax
 yah sector nahin sudharega to rojgaar main vruddhi nahin hogi
 People usually start small, owning it
 baad main use company main badalte hai jab bijness bada hota he
 Such owners of this sector do not benefit from tax deduction
 unhen abhi bhi 42

 The Narendra Modi government is politically the most successful government
 abhi hone vaale chunaavon main jeet ke baad vah apane gungan main mast ho jaaegi
 But his huge failure on the economic front is making his supporters cry

 This is why there is a bad employment situation
 lekin narendra modi kii lokapriyata kaa yah charam paimaana kaha jayega ki jo berozegaar he or jinke bijness dub gaye yaa aadhe se bhi kam ho gaye wo abhi bhi unke bhakt hai

 uttar pradesh kii varanasi loksabhaa seat se pradhanmantri narendra modi ek baar phir chunavi maidan main hai
 PM Modi will file nomination papers on Friday
 lekin, namakan se pehle guuruuvaar ko varanasi main mega road sho kar vipaksh ko apni takat kaa ehsaas karaayenge
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi descended from Kashi and wiped out opposition parties in Purvanchal
 varanasi seat se congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ke chunaav ladane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the
 But in the meantime Congress has made Ajay Rai a candidate from this seat
 vahiin sapa ne aise ummidavaar par daanv lagaaya he jo meyar ke chunaav main bijepi kii mridula jaiswal se maat kha chuki hai
 It is believed that the path of Narendra Modi is easier than 2014 this time
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ke netaa record maton kii jeet kaa bharosa jataa rahe hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi contested from Varanasi as well as Vadodara
 lekin siyaasi ghamaasan varanasi ke ran main dekhne ko mila tha, modi ke khilaaf aam aadmi party ke sanyojak kejariwal or congress se ajay raay ne taal thokkar chunavi mukaable ko dilachasp bana diya tha
 The eyes of the country were fixed on Varanasi seat
 kejariwal apni team ke saath banaras kii galiyon main gum-gum kar vot maang rahe the
 The result was that Narendra Modi had camped in Varanasi for the last three days of the election campaign
 is dauraan unhone road sho or choti-choti nukkad sabhaayen karke varanasi ke siyaasi maahaul ko 'modimay' bana diya tha
 After this, Narendra Modi went on to win by defeating Kejriwal by nearly a quarter of a million votes
 varanasi seat par congress ke ajay raay, basapa ke ajay prakaash jaiswal or sapa ke kailash chaurasia milakar jitna vot hasil kiya tha, usase kahin zyada narendra modi ke hisse main aayaa tha
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi is once again in the political struggle
 modi ke khilaaf gathbandhan kii ore se sapa ne shalini yadav ko utaara he
 While the Congress has announced the name of Ajay Rai
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke professor ashok kaul ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki narendra modi ke saamne puraa maidan khaali padaa he
 There has been a lot of development work in Benares in the last five years
 vipaksh ke paas koi aisa cheharaa nahin he jo maujuuda samay pradhanmantri narendra modi ko takkar de sake
 He said that the opposition is definitely talking about presenting a challenge to Modi through ethnic mobilization, but there is little chance of success in it
 vahiin sankatmochan mandir ke mahant professor vishwambharnath mishra kaa kahana he ki narendra modi pradhanmantri hai
 No candidate is visible yet
 iske baavjood narendra modi varanasi main mega road sho kar rahe hai
 While there was no need for it, are they showing muscle power in Benaras
 unhone kaha ki modi ne yahaan se chunaav jeetne ke baad banaras kii bahut sari chijen chaupat kar di he
 It was a quiet city, but today the whole of Benaras looks disturbed and restless

 gujarat main jaise hi narendra modi ne apni 'hetric' jeet kaa paracham laharaaya vaise hi endie main unhen pradhanmantri ke taur par pesh karne kii maang bad gai, vahiin congress bhi 2014 kii taiyaariyon main jute gaya he
 Some Congress leaders have already demanded to project Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister
 agar aisa hota he to 2014 main modi banaam rahul 'mahayuddh' dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 After Gujarat's victory, Modi's confidence has increased tremendously, there is a strange silence in the Congress camp after the uproar
 vaise to modi ke dilli aane kii charchaa bijepi ke bheetar se baar-baar hoti rahi he, jaahir he is jeet ke baad to ye shor or bad jayega
 This echo of Modi's supporters may be heard in the corridors of Delhi
 2014 ke aam chunaav main desh ko do sabase badi partiyaan bhidengi to ho saktaa he ki ye muqabla narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi kaa ho jaae
 Right now both of them have faced each other in Gujarat assembly elections
 rahul gandhi gujarat main congress prachaar ke liye aae to kaha tha, 'ye gujarat ke logon kii mehnat he jiskaa shrey modi le rahe hai
 Congress started development here
 'to modi ne palatwaar karte hue kaha tha, 'rahul gandhi apana homework karke aaen to acha rahegaa
 'obviously, if both face to face in 2014, then the contest will be a thorn
 ye baat alag he ki congressi netaa is tulana ko bhi galat maanate hai
 Salman Khurshid has said on this issue, 'the whole country knows who Rahul Gandhi is, but Modi cannot be talked about
 ' gaur karne kii baat ye he ki 2014 kii taiyaari ye donon netaa apane-apane tareeke se kar rahe hai
 Modi has got his iron out by hitting a hat-trick in Gujarat, while Rahul Gandhi has not been able to prove himself even after all the efforts
 gujarat main modi ne apni chhavi vikaas purush ke taur par banaai he, rahul gandhi bhi apane tareeke se vikaas kii baat karte hai
 Narendra Modi is a big political strategist
 wo dabang style main raajnneeti karte hai
 Not only outside the party but also within the party, they do not allow their opponents to raise their heads
 gujarat chunaav ke thik pehle unhone sanjay joshi ko jis tarah se baahar kaa rasta dikhva diya
 This is one way of his politics
 vikaas kaa unhone apana modul taiyaar kiya he
 Be it Vibrant Gujarat or whether it is a matter of bringing the Nano plant from Singur to Delhi, Narendra Modi knows how to hit the spot
 sabase badi baat ye he ki unka apana ek janaadhar he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi is constantly working for his organization
 rahul gandhi bhi lambii ranneeti ke tahat kaam karte hai
 Instead of taking any major position in the government, they are working to irrigate the organization
 unhone congress sanghathan ko kaaphi had tak organij kiya he
 Right now the responsibility of the Election Committee of the party is on him, Rahul Gandhi travels continuously
 logon ke bich jate hai
 He is adept at drawing crowds, but the question is how much the crowd gathered to see and hear him turn into votes
 centre kii raajnneeti kii ore badhane se pehle modi kii raah main unhi kii party kii ore se kai rode hai, abhi tak ye bhi tay nahin ho paaya he ki 2014 main congress rahul gandhi ko piem ke taur par pesh karegi yaa nahin, lekin agar aisa hota he to muqabla behad dilachasp hoga
 Sharad Pawar is one of the most 'khanty' politicians in the country
 
 
 unke man kii thaah paanaa asambhav he
 
 
 Sharad Pawar remains with the Congress, despite the bad news coming for the Congress from all sides
 
 
 tamaam uthapatak ke baavjood unki nesanalist congress party, yani ensipi ne maharashtra main congress ke saath loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye siton kaa bantwaaraa kar liya he
 
 
 But Congress strategists still keep finding the meaning of Sharad Pawar's public statements, because sometimes he is warm towards Congress and sometimes softens
 
 
 ab enditivi ko die ek intervyuu main sharad pavaar ne kaha he ki varsh 2002 ke dangon ke liye gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ko zimmedaar nahin mana ja saktaa
 
 
 Pawar said that we should accept when the court has said something
 
 
 is mudde ko kyon baar-baar uthaaya ja rahaa he
 
 
 Significantly, Sharad Pawar's statement on the Gujarat riots came after an interview with Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to PTI, in which Rahul said that many questions have been raised by experts on the SIT (special Investigation Team) report and the lower The decision of the court is yet to be approved by the big courts
 
 
 haalanki pavaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki bataur mukhyamantri dangon ke liye modi kii jimmedaari banati he or unhen isaki jimmedaari leni chahie
 
 
 Sharad Pawar has said similar things about Narendra Modi and riots some time ago, but later in the meeting of the party's minority front, he made a scathing attack on Modi for the Gujarat riots
 
 
 jabaki 8 disambar, 2013 ko chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey aane ke baad pavaar ne congress alaakaman kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaae the
 
 
 Pawar then alleged that non-governmental organizations were dominating
 
 
 mana gaya ki vah sonia gandhi kii aguwai vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad par nishaanaa tha
 
 
 Despite all this, Pawar makes it clear that he will remain with the United Democratic Alliance (UPA)
 
 
 chunaav se pehle bhi or chunaav ke baad bhi
 
 
 But questions are being raised about Pawar's statements on Modi being soft in political circles
 
 
 poocha ja rahaa he ki sharad pavaar congress or modi par kabhi garam to kabhi naram kyon hote hai
 
 
 As far as Sharad Pawar's ambition to become Prime Minister is concerned, a full stop has not been imposed on his part yet
 
 
 vaise pavaar kehete hai ki unki party kii itani takat nahin he, jiske chalate vah pradhanmantri ban saken
 
 
 It is sure that Pawar will not contest Lok Sabha elections this time and he has reached Parliament through Rajya Sabha
 
 
 maharashtra ke rajanetaaon ke bare main mashhoor he ki ve chaahe kisi party main hon, magar aapas main pakki dosti hoti he
 
 
 Some of the leaders of Maharashtra BJP are even said to be mildly judged that their candidate for the post of Prime Minister is not Sharad Pawar, not Narendra Modi
 
 
 yah pavaar kii shakhsiyat or raajnneetik virodhiyon main unki lokapriyata kaa paimaana bhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 However, the secret of Pawar's sometimes hot, sometimes soft attitude seems to be to keep his doors open for the future
 
 
 agar aap shaadishuda hai to aapane apane pati ko shev karte jarur dekha hoga or agar ab tak aapaki shaadi nahin hui he to bhi apane bhai yaa pita ko to shev karte jarur dekha hoga
 Shaving is usually seen by combining only the best shaving cream and razor
 par kya best rager or shaving kriim kaa istemaal kar lenaa hi paryaapt he? ho saktaa he aap kahen ki shev karne ke baad after shev kaa istemaal karnaa jaruri he lekin aisa nahin he
 Just using good products is not enough
 shev karne ke dauraan zyaadaatar purush kuchisi galtiyaan karte hai jiskaa nakaaratmak prabhavatvachaa par padataa he
 These are some such mistakes which are not even known but their effect is clearly visible
 1
 Using cold water during shaving can be dangerous
 thande pani se shev karne par porce band ho jate hai jisase shev ek samaan nahin ho paati he
 In this case, it would be appropriate to use hot or lukewarm water
 2
 There is also a definite time to shave
 ek raat pehle shev karnaa zyada behatar vikalp he
 Getting up in the morning and shaving in a hurry can be dangerous
 sone se pehle shev karnaa behatar vikalp he
 3
 aajkal bazaar main kai aise rager maujuud hai jinka istemaal ek se adhik baar kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, wash the razor thoroughly before using it for a second time
 ye sunishchit karen ki usamen kisi prakaar kii dhul nahin jami ho
 The use of dirty razor poses a risk of infection
 4
 Shaving with too much pressure on the skin is not right
 isse bal bhale hi andar tak cat jaaen lekintwachaa ko kaaphi nuksanhota he
 This can cause skin irritation
 5
 Be sure to use the after shave after shaving
 agar after shev nahin he to uski jagah moishcharizer kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Otherwise jealousy may occur
 shev karne ke baad twachaa rukhi ho jaati he
 In such a situation, it is very important to use moisturizer or after shave

 Sidhu has given five suggestions to the Prime Ministers in these accounts
 unhone kaha he ki is coridor kii 'pavitrataa' ko banaae rakhane ke liye concreet kaa koi nirmaan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He wrote, 'the sanctity and purity of Kartarpur Sahib and Dera Baba Nanak Gurdwara Sahib await the footsteps of our pilgrims
 lekin hamaare kadamon se inke itihaas, vaastukala or paristhitiki main ksharan bhi hota he
 If we respect this sacred land the most, then we should make this path easy so that it cannot be spoiled in the name of commercialization and convenience of devotees
 'unhone donon netaaon se maang kii he ki is pavitra bhoomi kii raksha ho or tirthayatriyon ke lagaataar pravaah ke bich tikaoo or organic tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaae, jaise pani kaa tikaoo istemaal
 He has suggested that pilgrims should control the 'movement' and vehicles should be stopped in this corridor, people should walk on foot and only the elderly are allowed to use vehicles
 siddhu ne apane khat main likhaa he, 'hamen mukhyat: paidal hi janaa chahie, sirf bujurg, biimaar, divyang logon ko chhot milani chahie
 Facilities like toilet should be on the way
 kisi bhi keemat par logon ko nijee vaahan le jane kii ijaajat nahin di jaani chahie
 Apart from providing facilities like washroom, it should also be kept in mind that the system of 'waste disposal' should be implemented as per the requirements
 ' unhone joardaar tareeke se yah maang kii he ki plastic bag, bottle, sterophom, dibbaband khanpan ke istemaal par bilkul roak ho or tirthayatriyon ke liye jagah-jagah lungar kii vyavastha ho
 Sidhu wrote in his letter, 'the system of garbage disposal should be carefully prepared and implemented

 Suddenly a shocking news comes from the house of BSP MP Narendra Kashyap
 khabar ye ki saansad mahoday kii bahu ne khud ko bathroom main band kar goli maar lee
 But in a full house
 na to kisi ko is goli kii awaz sunai detii he or na hi police ko mauka-e-vaardaat par koi hathiyaar hi padaa miltaa he
 So is it a suicide? Is murder or else
 
 there are a few? These questions were still floating in everyone's mind that the secret of this death would be removed
 ek or chaunkaanewaali kahani saamne aa jaati he
 MP Narendra Kashyapki daughter-in-law and his elder son Dr Sagar's wife Himanshi have been shot
 goli bhi aisi-waisi jagah nahin, balki sir main or wo bhi behad qareeb se
 In a hurry, the people of the house rushed to Yashoda Hospital in Ghaziabad with Himanshi, but on reaching there, the doctors had declared Himanshi dead
 chunki maamlarasyamayi halaat main hui mautka tha, fouran is maamle main police kii bhi entry ho gai
 The in-laws are describing Himanshi's death as a suicide
 sasuravaalon ne sunai yah kahanehimanshi kii laash ko postmortem ke liye bhijwane ke saath-saath police kii ek team saansad mahoday kii kothi main ja pahunchi
 The Kashyap family told the police that apart from Himanshi himself, Narendra Kashyap and his wife, two nephews, a nephew, Himanshi's one and a half year old daughter, a med and gunner were present in the house before the incident
 lekin ittefaq se himanshi ke alaava ye sabhi ke sabhi log ghar ke ground floor par the or himanshi akeli first floor ke apane bathroom main nahaane gai thi
 But when she did not return for long, Himanshi's mother-in-law sent a boy in the house to call her
 kai baar bulaane or dastak dene ke baavjood bathroom main band himanshi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 According to the in-laws, Himanshi's silence made him suspicious and immediately broke the bathroom door
