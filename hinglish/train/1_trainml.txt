 Every year thousands of Indian students go abroad to get higher education
 UNESCO 2017 kii haalia report kii maane to videsh main padhai kii ichha rakhane vaale zyaadaatar bhartiya chaatro kii pehali pasand america he
 If you want to study in the US, then know these things, Australia is at the second place in this list and Britain has slipped 4 percent from last year due to its strict visa rules
 unesco 2017 kii report ke anusaar videsh main padhai karne kii chahat rakhane vaale bhartiya chaatro ke liye america is saal bhi pehali pasand bana hua he
 Australia is second, while Britain is third
 videsh main padhai, ye test hai jarurisal 2016 main ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jane vaale bhartiya chaatro main 48 fisadi america jane vaale the, jabaki 11 fisadi chaatro ne australia ko chunaa or sirf 8 fisadi chaatr britain gaye
 According to Britain's Indian High Commissioner YK Sinha, strict visa rules are the main reason behind the decrease in the number of students going to the UK for studies
 avaidh rup se america main rukne kii koshish pad sakati he mahangisal 2010 main jahaan britain main padhai karne vaale bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya 40,000 thi, vahiin aaj yah sankhya ghatakar maatr 19,000 rah gai he

 america main jahaan bhartiya chaatro kii sankhya bad rahi he, vahiin bitrain main ghat rahi he

 It seems that Shiv Sena has not been able to trust BJP
 vidhayak dal kii baithak main faisla liya gaya he ki pehle bijepi likhit main de ki vah dhai-dhai saal mukhyamantri vaale yani 50-50 vaale formule par raji he
 After finishing the meeting, Shiv Sena MLA Ramesh said that all rights have been given to Uddhavji
 jo wo kahenge vahi hoga
 At the same time, another Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik said that the BJP will not join the Shiv Sena government until it gives in writing
 jo tay hua he 50 - 50 formula uske tahat dhai dhai saal kaa mukhyamantri hona chahie
 Most of the Shiv Sena mlas of Maharashtra want that this time Shiv Sena should be given the post of Chief Minister and this post should be given to Aditya Thackeray
 in vidhayakon kaa kaa kahana he ki unke paas nai soch he
 Shiv Sena has got 56 seats in the assembly elections
 Pratap sarnaik,shiv sena:in our meeting it was decided that like Amit Shah ji had promised 50-50 formula before LS polls,similarly both allies should get chance to run Govt for 2
 5-2
 5 years so Shiv Sena should also have CM

 The Shiv Sena wants to take advantage of this because the BJP had contested alone in the last election and completely captured the government
 lekin is baar halaat badal gaye hai
 This is the reason why Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has shared the tiger (shiv Sena symbol) on a cortoon tweeter, which has a watch around its neck (NCP symbol) and a lotus flower in the hand (bjp's election symbol)

 from the day of Bhai Dooj, free travel for women is going to start in all buses of Delhi
 ab mahilaayein ditisi or cluster kii bason main muft yatra kar sakengi
 Transport Minister of Delhi Government Kailash Gehlotne said that free travel for women in buses will start from Tuesday
 iske liye mahilaon ko muft main tikat milenge
 Still away from the promise, the Delhi Government, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), in its election manifesto, promised to deploy marshals for the safety of women in the buses of Delhi, but currently only three and a half thousand marshals could be appointed in four and a half years
 Huh
 dilli sarkaar ke mutabik shaam ko chalane vaali zyaadaatar ditisi-cluster kii bason main marshall pehle se hi niyukt kiye ja chuke hai
 Training of 6000 marshals for the safety of women has been started simultaneously at Tyag Raj Stadium in Delhi

 maujuuda saadhe teen hajaar marshall main homeguard purv sainik or civil dephence karmchaaree shaamil hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party can attract a large vote of women by appointing a marshal to protect women in buses on a large scale just before next year's elections in Delhi
 dilli chunaav main mahila suraksha har baar ek bada vishay rahaa he
 Under the protection of women, about two lakh CCTV cameras are also being installed in the first phase by the state government in Delhi
 somvaar ko 6000 suraksha sahaayak apane apane ditisi depo main report karenge, jahaan se unhen alag-alag bason main tainaat kar diya jayega
 DTC says that in the next few days it will deploy a total of 12000 marshals, who will be present in all buses in all three shifts
 mangalvaar yani bhai dooj ke din se hi dilli kii sarkari or cluster bason main mahilaon ke liye yatra free hone ja rahi he
 In such a situation, the DTC hopes that more and more women will prefer traveling by buses
 kitna kargar hoga siyaasi daanvbata den ki suraksha ko durust karne ke liye badi taadaad main marshalon kii niyukti kejariwal sarkaar kaa ek bada daanv he
 It is not known how much benefit this step will give to the Kejriwal government in elections, but it will obviously prove to be a big step for the safety of women
 bason main marshall honge to mahilaayein bekhauf yatra kar sakengi
 After being reprimanded by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress over comments made in Beijing last week about the attitude of the Union Home Ministry towards Chinese companies, Jairam Ramesh, Minister of State for Environment and Forests, maintained complete silence on the issue on Tuesday
 jalwaayu parivartan par akalan ke liye bhartiya tantra (aiensisie) kii rashtriya rajdhani main hui kaaryshaala main aaye ramesh ne apane sambodhan se pehle hi saaf kar diya, ‘main yahaan china (beijing main kii gayi apni tippanee) ke sandarbh main kuch bhi kehane nahin aayaa hum’
 When reporters started bombarding Ramesh with an assessment report on the 2007 emission of greenhouse gases in India, he flatly refused to say anything
 unase samvaadadaataaon ne sabase pehle yah poocha ki kya vah apni tippaniyon ke liye maafee maang chuke hai or kya unhone vaaki koi spashtikaran diya he
 Ramesh did not comment on both these questions
 iske baad jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kya unke or kendriya grih mantri pi
 If there is any conversation between Chidambaram, then he refused to answer anything on this
 yah poochne par ki kya vah mangalvaar ko congress mukhyalay jane vaale hai to ramesh ne mahaj yahi kaha, ‘kisaliye?’ramesh se jab phir beijing kii tippaniyon par chaaye vivaad par pratikriya chaahi gayi to unhone mahaj yahi kaha, ‘main yahaan sirf green house gaison ke utsarjan ke bare main baat karne aayaa hum
 In the eighties, we were ahead of China in terms of solar energy, wind power and clean energy, but in the following years we lagged behind
 ’asal main, ramesh ne pichley dinon beijing main kaha tha ki bharat main chini nivesh ko lekar grih mantralay anaavashyak chaukas rukh apanaae hue he or usne aise nivesh par gairajaruri bandishen laga rakhi hai
 Later, he received reprimand from the Prime Minister and the Congress for his remarks about other ministries in other countries

 i urge AAP vol to go and help victims(2 / 2)— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)october 19, 2015 On the disputed post of former Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has lodged a deep objection saying that due to the disease of splash, some people continue to speak at home from house to house, it seems that Bihar's mai- The father is nitish kumaar ne katju kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki kashmir ke saath bihar ko dene kii baat kar rahe hai lagata he vahi bihar ke maalik hai
 Tell me that there are such people in this world, they keep on talking in different ways
 vahiin katju ke post par bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki katju ke post par sateek jawaab nitish kumaar hi de sakate hai kaaran ki do maah pehle yahi katju nitish kumaar ko pradhanmantri or arvind kejariwal ko up pradhanmantri bana rahe the
 At a function in Patna, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made a comment on the post of Justice Katju, saying that Bihar has a glorious history
 nitish kumaar ne bihar ke gauravshaalee itihaas kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki yahi bihar he, yahi patna he, yahi patliputra he jahaan se itane bade bhubhag par shashan chalata tha jitne bade bhubhag main aaj bharat desh bhi nahin he
 Nitish Kumar said in the talk that Buddha attained enlightenment in this Bihar, Lord Mahavira was born in this Bihar, Chanakya created economics in this Bihar, the land of Chandragupta and Emperor Ashoka has been Bihar
 unhone kaha ki isi bihar se aryabhatta ne shunya kaa avishkaar kiya or usee bihar kaa ghar baithe maai-baap banane lagate hai kuch log, lagata he vahiin bihar ke maalik hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar while attacking Katju without naming said that maybe some people are facing some difficulty from Bihar these days, how can they spend the evening time, then we cannot help them in this
 lekin iske liye bhi maine ek suzav pehle de diya he ki kamare kaa batti band kiijie or ek glass zeus pi lijie lagegaa kii vahi pi rahe hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that Bihar will once again achieve that place of pride, he cares about the pride of every human being in Bihar
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki sharaab mukt bihar, khule main shouch mukt vaataavaran, har ghar main bijli, gaanv or shahar ke har gali main pakki sadak ke saath-saath sarkaar ke saat nishyach kaa jab kriyanvayan ho jayega to bihar itani unchaaiyon par jayega ki aap kah sakate hai Sky is the limit
 Nitish Kumar said that i do not know when Bihar will become a smart city, but after the implementation of seven decisions, people of Bihar will definitely become smart
 vahiin justise katju kevivaditpost par bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki isi katju ne do maheene pehle nitish kumaar ko desh kaa pradhanmantri or arvind kejariwal ko up-pradhanmantri bana rahe the to us vakt jediu ke log katju kii bahut prashansa kar rahe the
 In such a situation, only people of JDU can answer Katju's statement correctly
 bijepi ne pehle bhi katju ko gambhirtha se nahin liya or aaj bhi gambhirtha se nahin le rahaa he
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that Nitish Kumar should reply on Katju's Facebook post
 sawaal yahaan bijepi or jediu kaa nahin he sawaal he bihar kii asmita kaa, koi jaruri nahi ki is bayaan kopichley bayanonse jod kar dekha jaye
 But here too politics begins
 susheel modi ne ye baat sahi kahi ki unke bayanon ke wo gambhirtha se nahi lete he lekin bihar kii janata bhuulane vaali nahin he
 Katju has made a very lewd joke with Bihar by making this statement
 katju par exiaar darjavivaadit post ke maamle main justise katju par patna ke shastrinagar thane main exiaar darj kar liya gaya he
 These firs have been lodged by Janata dal-u spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar on charges of making objectionable remarks about Bihar and Kashmir on social media
 niraj kumaar ne fasebuk kii copy bhi laagai he jisamen katju ne likhaa he- pakistan yadi kashmir chahta he to ham use dene ko taiyaar hai vasharten vah kashmir ke saath bihar lene ko taiyaar ho jaae
 Neeraj Kumar has said in the FIR that it is a language to undermine national unity, which spreads hatred towards Kashmir and Bihar

 VC Jamir Uddin Shah has made an absurd statement regarding the entry of girls into the library of Aligarh Muslim University
 shah ne kaha ki agar uniwarsity kii librari main ladakiyon ko pravesh karne kii ijaajat di to librari main chaar guna zyada ladke honge
 On the other hand, the VC has overturned his statement as soon as the matter is caught
 unhone kaha ki ladakiyon par bain kii meri koi manshaa nahin thi or na hi koi bhedbhaav mere man main tha
 i made such a statement due to lack of space in the library
 unhone kaha ki maamle ko bevajaah tool diya ja rahaa he
 Some people have bad intentions of university name
 unhone kaha ki ham ladakiyon ko behatar avasar dena chaahate hai
 Know that there is Maulana Azad Library in Aligarh Muslim University
 is librari main ladakiyon ke pravesh ke liye mahila college kii chaatraon kii ore se lambey vakt se maang kii ja rahi he
 Women college principal Naima Gulrej said in a college program that we can understand the demand of girls in the library

 In such a situation, discipline may come up if girls stay in the library
 librari main pravesh ke liye beete kai saalon se mahila student wing kii ore se maang kii ja rahi he
 President of Women's College Student Union, Gulfija Khan said that we study in Aligarh Muslim University

 If there is a problem of lack of space in this matter, then we will come out of the library with only books, but it is our right

 In the politics of Rajasthan, if someone's name comes to the forefront of the top leaders breaking caste domination, it is Ashok Gehlot
 soobe ke do baar mukhyamantri rahe gahalot kaa parivaar mali samaaj se aata he
 His family used to perform magic tricks once upon a time
 gujarat ke prabharee ke taur par unhone vahaan kii yuva tikdi hardik-alpesh-jignesh ko congress ke saath khadaakar party ko jeet kii dahalij par laa khadaa kiya or aaj kii taarikh main bataur sanghathan mahasachiv gahalot party ke kendriya netritv main adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke sabase kareeb hai
 The eye of Indira, Sanjay brought identity Ashok Gehlot had the opportunity to join the Congress in the 70s, when Sanjay Gandhi was in the party during the time of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 jab sanjay gandhi ke karibiyon ne unhen ashok gahalot ke bare main bataaya to unhone gahalot ko rajasthan main party ke chaatr sanghathan enesayuai kaa adhyaksh banaaya
 In the early days, people of Sanjay Gandhi's circle used to address Gehlot as 'gilli Billy'
 aaj rahul gandhi kii congress main is taqatvar netaa ke bare main logon ko zyada nahin pataa bajaay iske ki unke pita babu lakshmana singh daksh ek mashhoor jaadugar the
 During his childhood, Gehlot was also a part of his feat across the country as an assistant to his father
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he kiashok gahalothapar sabase pehle swayan indira gandhi kii najar padi thi
 When the refugee crisis in the Northeast arose after the rebellion in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)
 gahalot kii umr us vakt 20 saal thi, or indira ne unhen raajnneeti main aane kaa nyotaa diya
 After which Gehlot took part in the All India Congress Committee's Indore conference and here he met Sanjay Gandhi
 yuva congress ke vistaar kaa daur jisane kai kaddavar netaa diecongress ke indore sammelan main divangat netaa priyaranjan dasamunshi yuva congress ke adhyaksh chune gaye the
 This was the time when Indira and Sanjay Gandhi wanted to prepare the Youth Congress to compete with the right wing Jana Sangh and its allies
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki congress main yah kaal yuva netritv ke ubhaar kaa svarnim kaal tha
 During this period, the party got many important leaders including Ashok Gehlot, Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh, Ambika Soni, Vayalar Ravi, AK Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad and BK Hariprasad
 yah sabhi netaa aaj ke congress main badi haisiyat rakhte hai
 According to his nature and simple background, Ashok Gehlot continued to work in Rajasthan keeping a low profile
 lekin sanjay gandhi kii vimaan haadase main maut ke baad jab party main rajeev gandhi ko ahm role mila, tab unhone gahalot ke naam kii sifarish indira gandhi kii cabinet main rajyamantri ke taur par kii
 During this time, two big leaders of the Congress in Rajasthan were dominated by former Chief Minister Haridev Joshi and Shivcharan Mathur
 lekin gahalot ko rajeev gandhi kaa bharosa hasil tha
 The incident that cleared the way for Gehlot is a famous incident when Rajasthan was reeling under a severe drought and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called a cabinet meeting at Sariska National Park, 170 km from Delhi
 is baithak main rajeev ne rajya ke sabhi mantriyon ko sarkari gadiyon kii bajaay apni gaadi se aane ke nirdesh die the or rajeev khud ek nijee car chalaa rahe the
 Then a traffic constable asked Rajiv's car to turn right instead of giving a signal to go straight
 consteble kii is galati kaa parinaam haridev joshi ke liye mahangaa sabit hua, kyonki diavarjan kii vajah se rajeev us sthaan par pahunch gaye jahaan mantriyon kii sarkari gaadiyaan khadi thim
 Actually Rajiv wanted to give a message of austerity in the party and the government through it
 rajeev gandhi kii naaraazgi kii vajah se joshi lunch main shaamil nahin hue, tab mejabaan joshi kii anupasthiti main unke mitra or centre main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri pivi narsimha raav ne maamle ko thanda karne kii naakaam koshish kii
 And a month after this incident, Haridev Joshi was replaced by Shiv Charan Mathur as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 bhale hi lagbhag do saal baad joshi ne phir vaapasi kar lee ho, lekin iske baad congress alaakaman ke saamne unki wo dhak nahin rahi
 During the indelible impression left at the center, Gehlot was playing the role of the Minister of Tourism in the Central Government
 rashtriya rajdhani main iene market ke thik saamne dilli haat ke nirmaan kaa shrey gahalot ko jaataa he jinhone desh bhar ke shilpkaar, hastshilp kala ke logon ke utpaada ko sidhe graahakon tak bina kisi bichauliye ke pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 Gehlot's proximity to Rajiv did not let his role diminish in the Congress headed by Sonia Gandhi and then Rahul Gandhi
 1998 kevidhansabha chunaavamein bijepi kii haar hui or bhaerosingh shekhavat ke baad ashok gahalot ko mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 Gehlot was not an MLA at this time, so Mansingh Deora, MLA from Sardarpura Assembly of Jodhpur vacated the seat for him
 jiske baad hue upachunaav main jeet ke baad se gahalot lagaataar is seat se vidhayak hai
 If the Jats are disillusioned with the Congress, the Congress lost its traditional Jat vote in Rajasthan when Ashok Gehlot, who came from the Mali community, became the Chief Minister
 rajputon ke dhur virdohi jat rajasthan main 60-70 siton par nirnaayak bhoomika main rahete hai
 Jats were inclined towards the Congress from the first assembly elections in the state as the Congress abolished the monarchy
 congress ke bade jat netaa ramanivas mirdha, nathuram mirdha, parsaram maderna kaa marwar main jabardast bolbalaa tha
 These leaders did not allow this fort to collapse even after the Emergency when the Congress was wiped out of North India
 apni vafadari ke liye lambey samay tak is samudaay ke netaa mukhyamantri banane aas lagaae rahen
 But after Ashok Gehlot became CM in 1998, his fascination continued to dissolve
 abhi bhi sarvamaanya hai gahalophashok gahalot kii saralata or saadagi unhen raajnneeti main kaaphi upar le gai
 There was a time when Gehlot did not get a place in front of Delhi's big leaders Ahmed Patel and Ghulam Nabi Azad and today they are standing in equal measure
 rajasthan kii baat kii jaae to gahalot rahul kii pasand se bheje gaye yuva netaa sachin payalat ke saath acha santulan banaae hue hai or abhi tak donon ke bich kisi tarah kii matbhed kii khabaren nahin ai hai
 What is Rahul keeping in mind that Gehlot should not come in the way of the pilot and the pilots should also respect his seniority
 rajasthan main is baar congress kii sarkaar banane par sachin payalat ko agle mukhyamantri ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he, jabaki aisa maanane waalon kii bhi kami nahin he ki yadi congress pradesh main kam antar se jitati he to gahalot rahul kii pehali pasand honge

 An example of how a simple household hobby can be turned into a big business is presented by a woman from Indore
 ianti sarjan dow
 Sunil Sethi had migrated from Indore to Bingham in England 21 years ago
 vahaan unka na koi parichit tha, na dost or na hi koi rishtedaar
 In such a situation, it was difficult for his 45-year-old wife Purnima Sethi to cut free time
 so, unhone europe kii nami-giraami antic shops main jaakar personal collection ek-ddha karne kaa man banaaya
 Today, on the strength of this hobby, he is a well-known businessman of the renowned artistic market

 Has reached inter arts life style product banane vaali duniyabar kii mashhoor companiyon ke antic or commercial utpaada bharat main uplabdh karwaati he
 Purnima says, "people from India used to praise my collection and used to ask me to buy the same piece
 kai baar kareebi logon ko khush karne ke liye apana collection dena padataa he
 As this trend continued to grow, Dr
 sethi ne mujhe iske kaarobaar main utarane kii salaah di
 "inter Arts" is providing Victorian Queens collection of well-known companies, printed cups of popular paintings and sugar jars in India

 Poornima clearly says that her collection is not for the common people
 unke graahak ve log hai jinhen antic or kalatmak chijen ikattha karne kaa shauk he or jo kharch karne main bhi sakasham hai
 Purnima has started exhibiting in some metros of India for the last four years, which has received good response from her
 kai european artist poornima ke liye khaas taur se saamaan bana rahe hai
 Many times this artistic item reaches the collection of full moon even before it reaches the European market
 ve taj or oberoi jaise hotalon main sho karti hai
 By increasing their purchasing power, the middle class has also joined the full moon customers
 ve bataati hai,’’pichley 10 saal main bharat main jabardast badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 i had my first show at the Taj in Mumbai, where only a few customers came
 lekin ab aisa nahin he
 The number of middle class has increased in buyers

 The Central Reserve Bank has revealed in its annual report that it has 8 in its gold reserves
 46 metric ton kaa ijapha kiya he
 According to the report RBI made this purchase during the financial year 2017-18
 is kharidari se maujuuda samay main rigerv bank ke khajaane main 566
 There is a stock of 23 metric tonnes of gold and according to the Reserve Bank, this purchase has been done to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves
 rigerv bank ke aankadon ke mutabik 30 june 2018 ko 566
 557 as on 30 June 2017 with the central bank as compared to 23 tonnes of gold reserves
 77 ton sone kaa bhandar maujuuda tha
 The Reserve Bank has said in its report that during the financial year 2017-18, along with the increase in gold reserves, it also increased the foreign exchange reserves
 yah kadam usne bank ke risk jisamen sibar security shaamil he ko dekhte hue uthaaya he
 Earlier, the central bank increased gold reserves in November 2009
 arabiai kii yah kharidari international monitory fund ke bhandaaran main ijapha karne ke simit kaarykram ke tahat kii gai thi or kendriya bank ne 200 metric tonsonakhridakar apane bhandaaran main ijapha kiya tha
 The special thing is that the RBI Act allows the Central Reserve Bank to buy gold
 haalanki rigerv bank saamaanya taur par china or rus ke kendriya bainkon kii tarah sone kii kharid-farokht nahin karata
 Therefore, after this purchase, people in the market once again believe that this is a clear indication that the demand for gold in the global bar is likely to increase

 According to US data, the Reserve Bank of India has sold US Treasury securities worth approximately $ 10 billion during April and June
 vahiin rigerv bank ke videshi mudra ke kul bhandar main lagbhag 405 billian dollar yaa 60 fisadi bond or security main maujuud he
 Therefore, to avoid losses due to the increase in bond yields, it is necessary to reduce the bonds from reserves

 karunanidhi ne kaha ki vah chunaav ayog ke is kadam ke peeche rahe mul kaaran ko jaananaa chaahate hai

 It is evident from this that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision on demonetisation on November 8 has had the biggest impact on rural India
 1
 When the decision of demonetisation came in the country, the challenge of sowing the Rabi crop was before the farmers of the country
 uttar bharat main punjab or haryana ke kai kshetron main rabi buaai ho chuki thi lihaaja unhen notebandi se is aashay nuksaan nahin uthaanaa padaa
 2
 rabi fasal kii buaai kar chuke kisaanon ke samanenotbandine sabase badi chunauti bhavishya kii kharidari ko lekar saamne ai
 These farmers had already received the money for the Kharif crop and it was time for their annual purchases such as tractors, pumps, fertilizers etc
 lekin notebandi lagu hone ke baad in kisaanon ko pehle note badali karaane kii chunauti aa gai
 3
 jin rajyon main rabi buaai der se hoti he vahaan kisaanon ke saamne sabase badi chunauti buaai ke liye beej kharidne kii thi
 In spite of all the assurances from the government, most of the farmers had to sow from the old seeds
 khaad kii kharid cash se hone ke kaaran unhen bazaar sudharne kaa intjaar karnaa padaa jisase unki rabi buaai main deree hui
 4

 Nagpur, Nashik and Delhi market across the country came to a complete standstill due to dependence on cash
 kisaanon ke saamne sabji or fal ko saste daron par nikaalane kii majaburi ban gai
 At the same time, he had to resort to check or loan
 5
 Due to scarcity of cash, the prices of fruits and vegetables were badly affected across the country
 tamaato, aalu, mirch or pyaaj kii badi khep is dauraan kheton se nikalakar bazaar pahunchati he
 But the scarcity of cash in the mandis made the farmers a means of very little income for these products
 6
 The central scheme for employment in rural areas has been badly affected
 desh ke lagbhag ek darjan rajyon ne kendra sarkaar se guhaar lagaai he ki vah tatkaal prabhaav se rajyon ko cash uplabdh karaae kyonki notebandi lagu hone ke baad se sarkaar lebar kaa pement nahin kar paa rahi he

 Due to problems in the real estate sector and labor payments in the cities, people were forced to move to the village
 notebandi lagu hone ke baad se gaanv palaayan kar chuke lebar ko desh main ek baar phir cash kii killat khatm hone kaa intjaar he
 8
 notebandi ke daur main sabase badi samasya gramin ilaakon main puraane note jamaa karaane or nayaa cash nikaalane main dekha gaya

 ek acchhee khabar hoti he or ek buree
 The interesting thing is that it is fun to read bad news, provided it is not really bad
 to ab dil tham kar suniye ki krime and detective magazine band ho gai he
 For many readers, this is a big push, especially for military personnel, residents of the Northeast and hippies, witty and intelligent people
 inamen se zyaadaatar purush hai
 Actually, Crime and Detective was a very interesting and wonderful magazine
 hajaaron pathakon ko is magazine kaa nasha tha
 This was the favorite companion of rail journeys of countless people like me, because the headlines on the pages of the magazine reveal the sensational crimes that flourish in the anonymous dark corners of our great nation or reveal the interesting stuff of entertaining railway passengers unaware of each other
 She would have become
 faridabada "chachee ke saath bhattije ke paapapurna sambandh ne chachaa kii lee jaan
 "rampur:" God protect parents from such daughters
 '' mujffarnagarah "pyaar main pagal mahila ne kiya sansanikhej aparaadh
 "raipur:" a lover proved more loving than her husband
 '' dillih "ek mahila kaa doharaa jeevanah do pati or do dharm
 No less fun was the famous "photo comics" written and directed by Shailabh Rawat, executive editor of Crime and Detective, which served erotic stories based on good and evil
 in kahaniyon kii khaas peshkash or kirdaaron ke ramse bros or kabhi saas, kabhi bahu kii tarj par aapasi bartaav or baatcheet (anuwaad ke tadake ke saath) ke andaaj ne prashansakon kii apni alag hi fouj taiyaar kii thi
 There was diversity and boldness in the subjects presented in it
 isamen dhongi baabaaon kii pole kholane ke saath transvestitis or bidisam ke prati bhi samajhadaari jataane kii baat bhi kah jaati thi
 How can a magazine full of straightforward entertainment lead to sudden death? who did this? Rawat says that apart from the railway platform and cantonment, magazine sales were the highest in the Northeast, while some "legal and technical problems" related to distribution arose, after which it had to be closed
 haalanki, sab kuch khatm nahin hua he
 According to Rawat, the Hindi monthly version of Crime and Detective Madhur Katha which was also the source of photo comics is still at the top with 5 million readers
 angreji patrika ke ant se pareshaan or udhaas prakashkon ke liye acchhee khabar he ki nai sadi prakaashan krime and detective ko digital plateform par phir se shuru karne ja rahaa he
 Come, there will be a little agreement to the erotic stories of adventurous hearts

 They both had a love for each other, but Maheshbhai had a quarrelsome nature
 duusari taraf kokila bahan bahut hi dharmik stri thi, bhagwaan par vishwaas rakhti
 Gradually, her husband's business-employment came to a halt
 kuch bhi kamai nahin hoti thi
 Maheshbhai now lived at home all day and now he took the wrong path
 ab unka swabhaav pehle se bhi adhik chidchida ho gaya
 One day in the afternoon an old chef stood at the door
 chehre par gajab kaa tej tha or aakar unhone daal-chaaval kii maang kii
 The Kokila sister gave Dal-rice and saluted the old Baba with both hands
 vruddh ne kaha sai sukhi rakhe
 Kokila sister said Maharaj Sukh is not in my destiny and described his sad life
 maharaj ne shri sai ke vrath ke baaren main bataaya 9 guuruuvaar falahar yaa ek samay bhojan karnaa, ho sake to betaa sai mandir janaa, ghar par sai baba kii 9 guuruuvaar puja karnaa
 Fasting Sai and teaching by law, giving food to the hungry, Sai Baba will fulfill all your desires, it is necessary to have unwavering reverence on Sai Baba
 kokila bahan ne bhi guuruuvaar kaa vrath liya
 Provided food to poor on 9th Thursday
 unke ghar se kalah dur hue
 There was a lot of peace in the house
 maheshabhai kaa swabhaav hi badal gaya
 His employment resumed
 thode samay main hi sukh-samrudhi bad gai
 Both husband and wife started living a happy life
 ek din kokila bahan ke jeth-jethaani surat se aae
 In talks, he told that his children do not study, so the exam has failed
 kokila bahan ne 9 guuruuvaar kii mahima bataai or kaha ki sai baba kii bhakthi se bachche acchhee tarah abhyaas kar paaenge
 But it is necessary to have faith in Sai Baba
 sai sabaki sahaayta karte hai
 His Jethani asked to explain the method of fasting
 kokila bahan ne kaha unhen vah sari baaten bataayin, jo khud unhen vruddh maharaj ne bataai thi
 In a few days a letter from his daughter-in-law from Surat came that his children are fasting Sai and read very well
 unhone bhi vrath kiya tha
 He wrote about this that his friend's daughter Shaadi Sai Vrat was a very good place to be
 unke padosi kaa gahanon kaa dibba gum ho gaya tha, jo ab waapas mil gaya he
 Many such amazing miracles happened

 But Maxwell took the innings by sharing an 85-run partnership for the fourth wicket with captain George Bailey

 Many more people have written their names besides me
 is sandarbh main likhaa gaya he ki ham log un logon main shaamil hai, jinhone yaqub memon kii faansee kii maafee ke liye raashtrapati ko likhaa he
 First, i have not written any such letter and even if i had written, i do not believe it is a treason
 magar ve log koun hai, jo kisi ke bare main deshadrohi hone kii afvaah failaa dete hai
 While doing so, they are respecting which court, law and country
 kya afvaah failaana bhi deshbhakti he
 One should also explore these patriots
 ye desh ke liye koun-sa kaam karte hai
 What is their civil conduct? aam taur par ye log kisi party ke bhrashtacharon par pardaa daalate rahete hai
 Fight for a team in the online world
 kai dalon ke paas ab aisi online sena ho gai he
 Their profiles are adorned with team-specific identification marks
 kisi main naare hote hai to kisi main netaa to kisi main dharmik pratik
 Has our democracy contracted them to identify the traitors, try to terrorize them by attacking their timeline
 saarvajanik jivan main tarah-tarah ke sawaal karne se hamaari naagarikta nikharati he
 Why it is important that everyone think the same way
 kya koi alag soch rakhe to uske khilaaf afvaah failaai jaae or aakraamak lafzon kaa istemaal ho
 Now you readers should speak against it
 agar aapako yah saamaanya lagata he to samasya aapke saath bhi he or iske shikaar aap bhi honge
 One day the message will spread against you on whatsapp and poison will spread, because the rules of this game decide who are the supporters of any party who have the resources and sophistication
 patrkaar nikhil vaaghle ne twit bhi kiya he, "ab is desh main koi baat kehani ho to logon kii bheed ke saath hi kehani padegi, varna duusari bheed kuchal degi
 
 
 "you general readers should think
 aap jab bhi kahenge, akele hi honge
 Online hooliganism is emerging as a dangerous trend all over the world
 ye ve log hai, jo skulon main 'buli' banakar aapke maasoom bacchon ko jivan bhar ke liye aatankit kar dete hai, mohalle ke chowk par khadey hokar kisi ladki ke baahar nikalne kii tamaam sambhaavnaaon ko khatm karte rahete hai or saamaajik pratishtha ko dhwast karne kaa bhay dikhaakar blackmel karte hai
 You must have seen in the movie 'masaan' how he records the brutal police station phone and ends the life of Devi and her father
 usase pehle devi ke premi dost ko maukey par hi maar detaa he
 This tendency is of killers, so be cautious
 beshak aap kisi bhi party ko pasand karte hon, lekin uske bheetar bhi to sahi-galat ko lekar bahes hoti he
 Four leaders have different lines, so you should resist this trend
 yaad rakhiegaa, inkaa gang badhegaa to ek din aap bhi fansenge
 So if any of your friends are doing this on your timeline, then warn them
 usase naata tod lijie
 Write to the leader of your party that if it is a supporter then we will not be able to remain your supporter
 kya aap waisi party kaa samarthan karnaa chahenge, jahaan is tarah ke online gunde hon
 It is not a question to question
 har dal main aise gunde bhar gaye hai
 Due to this, the online world will no longer be a world of citizens
 online gundgardee sirf faansee, dharm yaa kisi netaa ke prati bhakthi ke sandarbh main nahin hoti he
 Film artist Anushka Sharma has tweeted that she will block those who do irresponsible talk or damage someone's reputation
 monica levinsky kaa ted par diya gaya bhaashan bhi ek baar uthaakar pard lijie
 Monica Lewinsky has joined a London organization working against online hooliganism
 unka pran he ki ab vah kisi or ko is gundgardee kaa shikaar nahin hone dengi
 Visit the page of former editor Shambhunath Shukla on Facebook
 aae din vah aisi pravriti se pareshaan hote hai or inase ladane kii pratigya karte rahete hai
 It has become difficult to write anything openly
 ab aapako samaj aa hi gaya hoga ki santulan or 'is equal to' kuch or nahin, balki chup karaane kii tarkeeb he
 If you speak, we will also speak about you
 kya kisi bhi naagarik samaaj ko yah manzur hona chahie
 The advice to ignore these elements is absolutely such that you accept these goons
 dhyaan mat dijie
 The question is why not pay attention
 pradhanmantri ke naam par bhakthi karne waalon kaa utpaat kai logon ne jhela he
 When all this started with regard to the Prime Minister, he understood this danger
 baqayada saarvajanik chetavanee di, lekin baad main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki jin logon ko bulaakar yah chetavanee di, unamem se kai log khud aisa kaam karte hai
 That is why i said that keep an eye on friends or followers around you, who commit hooliganism online
 ye log saarvajanik jivan ke shishtachar ko tod rahe hai
 The current reference is against the hanging of Yakub Memon
 jab tak sazaa ke khilaaf tamaam kanoonee vikalp hai, unka istemaal deshadroh kaise ho gaya
 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians are also among those who raise questions and demand review
 adaalat ne to nahin kaha ki koi aisa kar deshadroh kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 If the court's verdict was supreme in this case then why would the Governor and President have provisions for reconsideration
 kya ye log samvidhan nirmaataaon ko bhi deshadrohi ghoshit kar denge
 Those people who ran away from the online world due to allegations of corruption ranging from Vyapam to Yakub Memon's case have returned
 khud dharm kii aad lete hai or duusare ko dharm ke naam par daraate hai, kyonki antim naitik bal inhen dharm se hi miltaa he
 They illegally take advantage of the collectivity that becomes or becomes a myth in the name of religion
 filmon main aapane dada tip ke kai kirdaar dekhen honge, jo sau najayas kaam karegaa, lekin bhakthi bhi karegaa
 This makes him a weak attempt to gain recognition in society
 agar online gundgardee karne waalon kii chali to puraa desh deshadrohi ho jayega
 It is also true that some people have done great harm, wrongdoing by linking Yakub Memon's case with righteousness
 faansee ke aankade bhi isaki pushti karte hai ki faisle kaa sambandh dharm se nahin he
 But are they not using this as a diet, who always live in such a situation that there is no option to spread the discussion across the city
 kya aapane inhen yah kehete suna ki ve dharm se jodne kaa virodh to karte hai, magar faansee kii sazaa kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 Yakub's case is not a case of being a Muslim
 punarvichaar ek sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 The court has the discretion and right to see it afresh if new facts come
 tippaniyan There is no provision for capital punishment in 90 countries
 kya vahaan yah tay karte hue aatankwaad or jaghanya aparaadhon kaa maamla nahin aayaa hoga
 Hundreds of people protest against the punishment on the grounds of vandalism
 aatankwaad ek badi chunauti he
 We have hanged many terrorists, but has terrorism ended
 sazaa kaa koun-sa makasad puraa hua
 Is this the ultimate aim of justice, about which nationalism comes up
 inke hamalon se jo parivaar barbaad hue, unke liye ye online deshbhakt kya karte hai
 a partyman goes to ask their condition
 faansee se aatankwaad khatm hota to aaj duniya se aatankwaad mit gaya hota
 Don't be naive about why and how terrorism thrives
 un krur raajnneetik sachchaaiyon kaa saamana kiijie
 If the reason for this was religion and would have been solved by hanging, then there would have been no Gurudaspur terror attack
 unke hamale se dharmik makasad nahin, raajnneetik makasad hi puraa hota hoga
 Religion is food, so that a certain kind of false collective consciousness can be instigated
 jo log is bahes main koode hai, unki soch or samaj dharmik pahchaan se aage nahin jaati he
 When they describe Pakistan as a terrorist and when they join hands and create diplomatic history, it seems that everything is like two-in-one radio
 man kiya to casette bajaayaa, man kiya to radio
 If we feel like we are patriots, if you feel like you are a traitor
 kisi ko in deshbhakton kaa bhi pataa lagaana chahie
 What work do they do for the country? inkaa naagarik aacharan kya he
 Generally, these people keep a check on the corruption of a party
 online duniya main ek dal ke liye ladate rahete hai
 Many parties now have such an online army
 inaki profile dal vishesh kii pahchaan chihnon se saji hoti hai
 Some have slogans, some have leaders and some have religious symbols
 kya hamaare loktantr ne inhen theka de rakhaa he ki ve deshadrohiyon kii pahchaan karen, unki timeline par hamalaa kar aatankit karne kaa prayaas karen
 In public life, our citizenship is enhanced by having a variety of questions
 kyon zaruri ho ki saare ek hi tarah se sochen
 Should someone think differently, a rumor should be spread against him and aggressive words are used
 ab aap pathakon ko iske khilaaf bolnaa chahie
 If you find this normal, then the problem is with you and you will be the victim
 ek din aapke khilaaf bhi whotsap par sandesh ghoomegaa or zehar failega, kyonki is khel ke niyam vahi tay karte hai, jo kisi dal ke samarthak hote hai, jinke paas sansaadhan or kutark hote hai
 Journalist Nikhil Waghale has also tweeted, "now, if you want to say anything in this country, you have to say it with the crowd of people, otherwise the other crowd will crush
 
 
 " aap saamaanya pathakon ko sochna chahie
 Whenever you say it, you will be alone
 puri duniya main online gundgardee ek khatarnaak pravriti ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 These are the people who terrorize your innocent children for a lifetime by becoming 'bullies' in schools, ending all possibilities of a girl's exit by standing at the locality square and destroying social prestige
 Let's blackmail by fearing
 aapane 'masaan' film main dekha hi hoga ki kaise vah krur thanedaar phone se record kar devi or uske baap kii zindagi ko khatm kar detaa he
 Before that Devi's lover kills the friend on the spot
 yah pravriti hatyaron kii he, isliye satark rahiye
 Of course you like any party, but even within that there is a debate about right and wrong
 chaar netaaon kii alag-alag line hoti hai, isliye aapako is pravriti kaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Remember, if their gang grows, one day you too will be trapped
 isliye agar aapaki timeline par aapkaa koi bhi dost aisa kar rahaa ho to use cheta dijie
 Break with him
 apni party ke netaa ko likhie ki yah samarthak rahegaa to ham aapke samarthak nahin rah paaenge
 Would you like to support a party where there are such online goons
 sawaal karnaa mukhaalafat nahin he
 There are such goons in every party
 iske kaaran online kii duniya ab nagarikon kii duniya rah hi nahin jaaegi
 Online hooliganism is not just in terms of hanging, religion or devotion to a leader
 film kalakaar anoushka sharma ne twit kiya he ki vah gair-zimmedaar baaten karne vaale yaa kisi kii pratishtha ko nuksaan karne waalon ko block kar dengi
 Pick up and read Monica Lewinsky's speech on TED once
 monica levinsky online gundgardee ke khilaaf kaam kar hi landan kii ek sanstha se jud gai hai
 Her pledge is that now she will not let anyone else fall prey to this hooliganism
 fasebuk par purv sampadak shambhunath shukla ke pej par jaakar dekhie
 He is troubled by such tendencies and vows to fight against them
 kuch bhi khulkar likhnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Now you must have understood that balance and 'is equal to' is nothing but a trick to silence
 aap bolenge to ham bhi aapke bare main bolenge
 Should any civil society accept this? in tatwon ko nazarandaaz karne kii salaah bilkul aisi he ki aap in gundon ko sweekaar kar lijie
 do not pay attention
 sawaal he ki dhyaan kyon na den
 Many people who have done devotion in the name of the Prime Minister have suffered
 pradhanmantri ko lekar jab yah sab shuru hua to vah is khatare ko samaj gaye
 Public warnings were given, but later it was also revealed that many people who called and gave this warning, many of them do such work themselves
 isiilie maine kaha ki apane aasapaas ke aise mitron yaa anucharon par nigaah rakhie, jo online gundgardee karata he
 These people are breaking the etiquette of public life
 maujuuda sandarbh yaqub memon kii faansee kii sazaa ke virodh kaa he
 As long as there are all legal options against punishment, how did they become treason
 sawaal uthaane or samiksha kii maang karne vaale main to hindu, muslim, sikh or isai bhi hai
 The court did not say that they are committing treason by doing so
 agar is maamle main adaalat kaa faisla hi sarvocch hota to phir rajyapal or raashtrapati ke paas punarvichaar ke praavdhaan kyon hote
 Will these people also declare the framers of the Constitution as traitors
 yaqub memon kaa maamla aate hi ve log, jo vyaapman se lekar tamaam tarah ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke kaaran online duniya se bhaage hue the, laut aae hai
 They themselves take the cover of religion and scare others in the name of religion, because they get the ultimate moral force from religion itself
 ve us samuhikta kaa najayas laabh uthaate hai, jo dharm ke naam par apane aap ban jaati he yaa jiske ban jane kaa myth hota he
 In the movies, you must have seen many characters of Dada type, who will do hundred illegal acts, but will also do devotion
 isse vah samaaj main manyata hasil karne kaa kamazor prayaas karata he
 If the people of online hooliganism run, then the whole country will become traitorous
 yah bhi sahi he ki kuch logon ne yaqub memon ke maamle ko dharmikata se jodakar kaaphi nuksaan kiya he, galat kaam kiya he
 The hanging figures also confirm that the verdict is not related to religion
 lekin kya is baat kaa ve log khuraaq kii tarah istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, jo hameshaa isi firaaq main rahete hai ki koi chaara mili nahin ki uski charchaa shahar bhar main failaa do
 Have you heard him say that he opposes the association of religion, but also opposes the death penalty
 yaqub kaa maamla musalmaan hone kaa maamla hi nahin hai
 Reconsideration is a constitutional right
 nae tathy aate hai to use nae sire se dekhne kaa vivek or adhikaar adaalat ke paas he
 The comments 90 deshon main faansee kii sazaa kaa praavdhaan nahin hai
 Should not have been the case of terrorism and heinous crimes while deciding there
 barbarta ke aadhaar par faansee kii sazaa kaa karodon log virodh karte hai
 Terrorism is a major challenge
 hamane kai aatankwaadiyon ko faansee par latakaaya he, par kya usase aatankwaad khatm ho gaya
 Which purpose of punishment was served
 kya insaaf kaa yahi antim makasad he, jise lekar rashtrabhakti umad aati he
 What do these online patriots do for the families who were ruined by their attacks
 koi party vaala jaataa he unka haal poochne
 Had terrorism ended by hanging, terrorism would have disappeared from the world today
 aatankwaad kyon or kaise panapata he, use lekar bhole mat banie
 Face those cruel political truths
 agar iskaa kaaran dharm hota or faansee se hal ho jaataa to gurudaspur aatanki hamalaa hi na hota
 His attack will serve the political purpose, not the religious motive
 dharm to khuraaq he, taaki ek khaas kism kii juthi samuhik chetana bhadakaai ja sake
 Those who have jumped into this debate, their thinking and understanding does not go beyond religious identity
 ve kab pakistan ko aatanki bataa dete hai or kab usase haath milakar kootnithik itihaas rach dete hai, aisa lagata he ki sab kuch tu-in-van radio jaisaa he
 Played cassettes if i wished, radio if i wished
 man kiya to ham deshbhakt, man kiya to aap deshadrohi
 In public life, our citizenship is enhanced by having a variety of questions

 " aap saamaanya pathakon ko sochna chahie
 Whenever you say it, you will be alone
 puri duniya main online gundgardee ek khatarnaak pravriti ke rup main ubhar rahi he
 These are the people who terrorize your innocent children for a lifetime by becoming 'bullies' in schools, ending all possibilities of a girl's exit by standing at the locality square and destroying social prestige
 Let's blackmail by fearing
 aapane 'masaan' film main dekha hi hoga ki kaise vah krur thanedaar phone se record kar devi or uske baap kii zindagi ko khatm kar detaa he
 Before that Devi's lover kills the friend on the spot
 yah pravriti hatyaron kii he, isliye satark rahiye
 Of course you like any party, but even within that there is a debate about right and wrong
 chaar netaaon kii alag-alag line hoti hai, isliye aapako is pravriti kaa virodh karnaa chahie
 Remember, if their gang grows, one day you too will be trapped
 isliye agar aapaki timeline par aapkaa koi bhi dost aisa kar rahaa ho to use cheta dijie
 Break with him
 apni party ke netaa ko likhie ki yah samarthak rahegaa to ham aapke samarthak nahin rah paaenge
 Would you like to support a party where there are such online goons
 sawaal karnaa mukhaalafat nahin he
 There are such goons in every party
 iske kaaran online kii duniya ab nagarikon kii duniya rah hi nahin jaaegi
 Online hooliganism is not just in terms of hanging, religion or devotion to a leader
 film kalakaar anoushka sharma ne twit kiya he ki vah gair-zimmedaar baaten karne vaale yaa kisi kii pratishtha ko nuksaan karne waalon ko block kar dengi
 Pick up and read Monica Lewinsky's speech on TED once
 monica levinsky online gundgardee ke khilaaf kaam kar hi landan kii ek sanstha se jud gai hai
 Her pledge is that now she will not let anyone else fall prey to this hooliganism
 fasebuk par purv sampadak shambhunath shukla ke pej par jaakar dekhie
 He is troubled by such tendencies and vows to fight against them
 kuch bhi khulkar likhnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Now you must have understood that balance and 'is equal to' is nothing but a trick to silence
 aap bolenge to ham bhi aapke bare main bolenge
 Should any civil society accept this? in tatwon ko nazarandaaz karne kii salaah bilkul aisi he ki aap in gundon ko sweekaar kar lijie
 do not pay attention
 sawaal he ki dhyaan kyon na den
 Many people who have done devotion in the name of the Prime Minister have suffered
 pradhanmantri ko lekar jab yah sab shuru hua to vah is khatare ko samaj gaye
 Public warnings were given, but later it was also revealed that many people who called and gave this warning, many of them do such work themselves
 isiilie maine kaha ki apane aasapaas ke aise mitron yaa anucharon par nigaah rakhie, jo online gundgardee karata he
 These people are breaking the etiquette of public life
 maujuuda sandarbh yaqub memon kii faansee kii sazaa ke virodh kaa he
 As long as there are all legal options against punishment, how did they become treason
 sawaal uthaane or samiksha kii maang karne vaale main to hindu, muslim, sikh or isai bhi hai
 The court did not say that they are committing treason by doing so
 agar is maamle main adaalat kaa faisla hi sarvocch hota to phir rajyapal or raashtrapati ke paas punarvichaar ke praavdhaan kyon hote
 Will these people also declare the framers of the Constitution as traitors
 yaqub memon kaa maamla aate hi ve log, jo vyaapman se lekar tamaam tarah ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke kaaran online duniya se bhaage hue the, laut aae hai
 They themselves take the cover of religion and scare others in the name of religion, because they get the ultimate moral force from religion itself
 ve us samuhikta kaa najayas laabh uthaate hai, jo dharm ke naam par apane aap ban jaati he yaa jiske ban jane kaa myth hota he
 In the movies, you must have seen many characters of Dada type, who will do hundred illegal acts, but will also do devotion
 isse vah samaaj main manyata hasil karne kaa kamazor prayaas karata he
 If the people of online hooliganism run, then the whole country will become traitorous
 yah bhi sahi he ki kuch logon ne yaqub memon ke maamle ko dharmikata se jodakar kaaphi nuksaan kiya he, galat kaam kiya he
 The hanging figures also confirm that the verdict is not related to religion
 lekin kya is baat kaa ve log khuraaq kii tarah istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, jo hameshaa isi firaaq main rahete hai ki koi chaara mili nahin ki uski charchaa shahar bhar main failaa do
 Have you heard him say that he opposes the association of religion, but also opposes the death penalty
 yaqub kaa maamla musalmaan hone kaa maamla hi nahin hai
 Reconsideration is a constitutional right
 nae tathy aate hai to use nae sire se dekhne kaa vivek or adhikaar adaalat ke paas he
 The comments 90 deshon main faansee kii sazaa kaa praavdhaan nahin hai
 Should not have been the case of terrorism and heinous crimes while deciding there
 barbarta ke aadhaar par faansee kii sazaa kaa karodon log virodh karte hai
 Terrorism is a major challenge
 hamane kai aatankwaadiyon ko faansee par latakaaya he, par kya usase aatankwaad khatm ho gaya
 Which purpose of punishment was served
 kya insaaf kaa yahi antim makasad he, jise lekar rashtrabhakti umad aati he
 What do these online patriots do for the families who were ruined by their attacks
 koi party vaala jaataa he unka haal poochne
 Had terrorism ended by hanging, terrorism would have disappeared from the world today
 aatankwaad kyon or kaise panapata he, use lekar bhole mat banie
 Face those cruel political truths
 agar iskaa kaaran dharm hota or faansee se hal ho jaataa to gurudaspur aatanki hamalaa hi na hota
 His attack will serve the political purpose, not the religious motive
 dharm to khuraaq he, taaki ek khaas kism kii juthi samuhik chetana bhadakaai ja sake
 Those who have jumped into this debate, their thinking and understanding does not go beyond religious identity
 ve kab pakistan ko aatanki bataa dete hai or kab usase haath milakar kootnithik itihaas rach dete hai, aisa lagata he ki sab kuch tu-in-van radio jaisaa he
 Played cassettes if i wished, radio if i wished
 man kiya to ham deshbhakt, man kiya to aap deshadrohi
 Online hooliganism is emerging as a dangerous trend all over the world
 ye ve log hai, jo skulon main 'buli' banakar aapke maasoom bacchon ko jivan bhar ke liye aatankit kar dete hai, mohalle ke chowk par khadey hokar kisi ladki ke baahar nikalne kii tamaam sambhaavnaaon ko khatm karte rahete hai or saamaajik pratishtha ko dhwast karne kaa bhay dikhaakar blackmel karte hai
 You must have seen in the movie 'masaan' how he records the brutal police station phone and ends the life of Devi and her father
 usase pehle devi ke premi dost ko maukey par hi maar detaa he
 This tendency is of killers, so be cautious
 beshak aap kisi bhi party ko pasand karte hon, lekin uske bheetar bhi to sahi-galat ko lekar bahes hoti he
 Four leaders have different lines, so you should resist this trend
 yaad rakhiegaa, inkaa gang badhegaa to ek din aap bhi fansenge
 So if any of your friends are doing this on your timeline, then warn them
 usase naata tod lijie
 Write to the leader of your party that if it is a supporter then we will not be able to remain your supporter
 kya aap waisi party kaa samarthan karnaa chahenge, jahaan is tarah ke online gunde hon
 It is not a question to question
 har dal main aise gunde bhar gaye hai
 Due to this, the online world will no longer be a world of citizens
 online gundgardee sirf faansee, dharm yaa kisi netaa ke prati bhakthi ke sandarbh main nahin hoti he
 Film artist Anushka Sharma has tweeted that she will block those who do irresponsible talk or damage someone's reputation
 monica levinsky kaa ted par diya gaya bhaashan bhi ek baar uthaakar pard lijie
 Monica Lewinsky has joined a London organization working against online hooliganism
 unka pran he ki ab vah kisi or ko is gundgardee kaa shikaar nahin hone dengi
 Visit the page of former editor Shambhunath Shukla on Facebook
 aae din vah aisi pravriti se pareshaan hote hai or inase ladane kii pratigya karte rahete hai
 It has become difficult to write anything openly
 ab aapako samaj aa hi gaya hoga ki santulan or 'is equal to' kuch or nahin, balki chup karaane kii tarkeeb he
 If you speak, we will also speak about you
 kya kisi bhi naagarik samaaj ko yah manzur hona chahie
 The advice to ignore these elements is absolutely such that you accept these goons
 dhyaan mat dijie
 The question is why not pay attention
 pradhanmantri ke naam par bhakthi karne waalon kaa utpaat kai logon ne jhela he
 When all this started with regard to the Prime Minister, he understood this danger
 baqayada saarvajanik chetavanee di, lekin baad main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki jin logon ko bulaakar yah chetavanee di, unamem se kai log khud aisa kaam karte hai
 That is why i said that keep an eye on friends or followers around you, who commit hooliganism online
 ye log saarvajanik jivan ke shishtachar ko tod rahe hai
 The current reference is against the hanging of Yakub Memon

 Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians are also among those who raise questions and demand review

 If the court's verdict was supreme in this case then why would the Governor and President have provisions for reconsideration

 Those people who ran away from the online world due to allegations of corruption ranging from Vyapam to Yakub Memon's case have returned
 khud dharm kii aad lete hai or duusare ko dharm ke naam par daraate hai, kyonki antim naitik bal inhen dharm se hi miltaa he
 They illegally take advantage of the collectivity that becomes or becomes a myth in the name of religion

 This makes him a weak attempt to gain recognition in society

 It is also true that some people have done great harm, wrongdoing by linking Yakub Memon's case with righteousness
 faansee ke aankade bhi isaki pushti karte hai ki faisle kaa sambandh dharm se nahin he
 But are they not using this as a diet, who always live in such a situation that there is no option to spread the discussion across the city

 Yakub's case is not a case of being a Muslim

 We have hanged many terrorists, but has terrorism ended

 Is this the ultimate aim of justice, about which nationalism comes up

 Don't be naive about why and how terrorism thrives

 If the reason for this was religion and would have been solved by hanging, then there would have been no Gurudaspur terror attack

 Religion is food, so that a certain kind of false collective consciousness can be instigated

 yaqub memon kaa maamla aate hi ve log, jo vyaapman se lekar tamaam tarah ke bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke kaaran online duniya se bhaage hue the, laut aae hai
 They themselves take the cover of religion and scare others in the name of religion, because they get the ultimate moral force from religion itself
 ve us samuhikta kaa najayas laabh uthaate hai, jo dharm ke naam par apane aap ban jaati he yaa jiske ban jane kaa myth hota he

 If the people of online hooliganism run, then the whole country will become traitorous
 yah bhi sahi he ki kuch logon ne yaqub memon ke maamle ko dharmikata se jodakar kaaphi nuksaan kiya he, galat kaam kiya he
 The hanging figures also confirm that the verdict is not related to religion
 lekin kya is baat kaa ve log khuraaq kii tarah istemaal nahin kar rahe hai, jo hameshaa isi firaaq main rahete hai ki koi chaara mili nahin ki uski charchaa shahar bhar main failaa do
 Have you heard him say that he opposes the association of religion, but also opposes the death penalty

 It is also true that some people have done great harm, wrongdoing by linking Yakub Memon's case with righteousness

 kya aapane inhen yah kehete suna ki ve dharm se jodne kaa virodh to karte hai, magar faansee kii sazaa kaa bhi virodh karte hai
 Yakub's case is not a case of being a Muslim

 Whatever the outcome of the Fatullah Test, at least Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Vijay will remember this Test because of their centuries

 The comments ek intervyuu main murali vijay ne kaha ki wo dohare shatak ko apana lakshya bana rahe hai
 He said that for this he will have to do special work on his fitness
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki dedh sau kaa aankada paar karne par unhen thakaan hone lagati he, nami or garmi kaa asar bhi dikhaai dene lagata he
 Vijay says that he is working on this aspect and maybe soon he will be seen scoring a double century

 Karnataka Governor HR Bhardwaj granted approval for prosecution of Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa on corruption charges, while on the other hand, the Chief Minister asked the Governor to apologize for comments against the BJP government
 gatirodh us samay shuru hua jab rajyapal ne pehle to pradesh mantrimandal dwaara paarit ek prastaav ko khaarij kar diya jisamen unase bhrashtachar ke maamalon main mukhyamantri bies yediurppa par abhiyojan kii prakriya ko chhodane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 Later Raj Bhavan sources said that Yeddyurappa and Home Minister R
K
 ashok par abhiyojan ko manjuuri de di gai he
 Unhappy with Bhardwaj's remarks, the ruling BJP on Saturday announced anti-governor protests across the state

 Reversing Yeddyurappa, the governor strictly stated in a letter that he could not cover up serious allegations of corruption
 abhi pichley 26 sitambar ko bharat sarkaar ke rajbhasha vibhaag kii sachiv mahodaya kaa ek patr jari hua, jo ki centre sarkaar ke mantralayon or vibhaagon ke sachivon ko sambodhit he
 Its subject is: Policy guidelines for the use of simple and easy Hindi in government work
 yah sahi disha main jari kiya gaya niti-nirdesh he
 The Department of Official Language has already issued such guidelines that the language of official business should be easy
 is patr main unke hawaale dete hue unhen doharaaya bhi gaya he
 04 January 2012: See in pictures India Today, in the sixth paragraph of this letter, the Department of Official Language has made its intention more openly
 makasad saaf he ki rajbhasha vibhaag aadhunik hindi ke anuroop rahanaa chahta he
 If this is not done, the official language will fall behind the language of the general public or be cut off
 phir, rajbhasha alag tarah kii hindi ho jaaegi or vah aam logon ke kaam kii nahin rah jaaegi
 It will start to serve the interests of the dominant and selfish people of the society, while our constitution makers did not have this intention in giving Hindi the status of official language
 isiilie, sahi uddeshy kii purti ke liye jaruri he ki rajbhasha hindi bhashiyon ko apni bhashaa lagani chahie
 Because of Jin and for whom Hindi is the official language of Hindi, when it will not be understood by them, then understand that they have been betrayed
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudeis patr main ek jagah mujhe jarur laga he ki rajbhasha vibhaag apni simaaon se aage bad gaya he
 He had to say his words, he should have said it
 jo kahi gai he, vah baat galat bhi nahin he
 All i have to say is that the manner of saying is not appropriate
 unhone rajbhasha kii saahitiyik bhashaa se tulana kar di he jisaki aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 This should not have been the subject of them
 sachiv ne apane patr ke duusare pare ko shuru karte hue likhaa he-''kisi bhi bhashaa ke do rup hote hai-saahitiyik or kaamkaaj kii bhashaa
 The use of literary language words in the working language reduces the tendency of the common man towards that particular language and increases mental opposition to it
 '' unhone tisare pare kaa antim vaakya likhaa he-''bhashaa kaa vishuddh rup sahitya jagat ke liye he; bhashaa kaa lokapriy or mishrit rup bolchaal or kaamkaaj ke liye he
 "21 December 2011: See India Today, in pictures, totally wrong
 jahaan tak main samajhataa hum, yah rajbhasha vibhaag kaa kaaryakshetra nahin tha ki sahitya ke bare main tulana karke bolaa jaae
 For example, Dalit literature is bringing in Hindi the distinctive language of its environment
 ab tak unki yah bhashaa hindi sahitya ke liye anjaan thi
 Then how can the Department of Official Language say that "the pure form of language is for the literary world?" Who has been indirectly considered in literature? This leads to a wrong message among litterateurs that Sanskrit literature is a real litterateur
 sahi baat yah he ki jis sanskritnishtha bojhil bhashaa se rajbhasha vibhaag dukhi hokar apana patr jari kar rahaa he, usee sanskritnishtha bojhil bhashaa se sahitya ke kshetra main dalit sahitya bhi lard rahaa he
 14 December 2011: See India Today in pictures
 It is completely unfair to say that the pure form of language is for the literary world
 sanskrit kii vajah se jis banaavati bhashaa ko sarkari kaamkaaj main istemaal karne se roka ja rahaa he, sahitya main bhi waisi kathin shabdaawalee or duruh style kii sanskritnishtha bhashaa kaa bahishkaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The same fight is going on in both places, be it the Department of Official Language or the world of literature
 yadi rajbhasha ko janata se joda janaa he to sahitya ko bhi aam aadmi se dur nahin janaa he
 07 December 2011: See India Today in pictures mumbai main hue aatanki hamalon ke dauraan giraftaar hue aatankwaadi aamir ne poochtacha ke dauraan bataaya he ki viley parley or waadi bandar main visphotak ismail khan ne rakhe the
 Ismail Khan was killed during the encounter
 gauratlab he 26 november ko hue mumbai main aatanki hamalon main kareeb 190 logon kii maut ho gai thi or 300 se adhik log ghayal hue the
 Akash Vijayvargiya, who was imprisoned for 5 days in a state of BJP in the state over the increased electricity bill, a few months ago, Aakash Vijayvargiya, who was imprisoned by beating the corporation officer with a bat, has once again warned in a threatening tone during the bjp's demonstration on Monday
 
 darasal, somvaar ko bijepi ne puure madhyapradesh main bijli ke bade hue bill or karjamaafee ko lekar kamalnath sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya tha

 isi dauraan kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue akaash vijayawargeey ne kaha ki 'sarkaar se bas ye do maang he ki jald se jald sabhi mantri, vidhayak or congress ke netaa maidan main pahunche or kisaanon kaa barish se jo nuksaan hua he uskaa muaavja jald se jald den
 'at the same time, while giving a statement on the increased electricity bills, Akash Vijayvargiya said that' My warning is to forgive the increased bills as soon as possible or send cheap bills as before
 varanaa jaise manoj bhaiya ne bataaya ki kamare main band karenge or aap ko to pataa hi he ki ham khaali haath to ghoomte nahin he
 This statement of Akash Vijayvargiya is being linked to the old incident when Akash had to go to jail after the Balland and BJP was disgraced across the country
 yahaan tak kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bijepi kii bhari baithak main akaash vijayawargeey ke vyavhaar ko galat bataaya tha
 Let us tell you that before the collision of a dilapidated building in Indore, the officer of the corporation team had fired the bat by Akash Vijayvargiya
 ghatana ke baad akaash vijayawargeey ko police ne naa keval giraftaar kiya tha balki kareeb 5 dinon tak jail main rahanaa padaa tha
 After this, Akash Vijayvargiya was granted bail by the special court of Bhopal

 ' The real test of the stakes BJP has played by making Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi the chairman of the party's election campaign committee at the expense of its 17-year-old partner Janata Dal (united) in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will be in Uttar Pradesh and political observer
 It is believed that this is also the target of bjp's 'modi missile'

 On the mention that the BJP is talking about going to the polls on the issue of unbridled inflation, corruption and development, then why did Advani displeasure and forward Modi at the cost of breaking the alliance with JDU, Mishra said that politics Some things are said and some things are said without saying, which is called 'messaging'
 yah bataate hue ki messaging ‘trigar maikenism’ kaa hissaa he, jiskaa matlab hota he paksh main ‘karant’ paidaa karnaa
 He said that Modi is the key to the bjp's same mechanism, which is opposed to the Gujarat riots among the opponents, while the fans are appreciated for the development of Gujarat
 yahi unki ‘euaspy’ he
 On the one hand, in the BJP and the NDA on the one hand, Modi and the NDA are playing a game of manipulation and opposition parties are calling the 'modi missile' as ineffective and meaningless, the party is the 'launching pad' for them
 It is ready to be prepared
 mishra ne kaha ki chunavi aankade bataate hai ki rashtriya raajnneeti main bijepi kii kamyaabi uttar pradesh main uske pradarshan par nirbhar rahi he
 He said, 'in the year 1991, the party crossed the 100 seats in the Lok Sabha for the first time and then it got 51 seats in 85 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh
 ’mishra ne kaha, ‘varsh 1996 main bijepi pehali baar 161 siton ke saath loksabhaa main sabase badi party banakar ubhari or tab use is soobe kii 85 main se 52 siton par jeet mili thi
 BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the Prime Minister for the first time although that government could run only for 13 days due to lack of majority
 'is zikr ke saath ki saal 1998 main loksabhaa main bijepi ko mili kul 182 siton main uttar pradesh se 57 siten shaamil thim or 1999 main 182 main is soobe ne 29 siton kaa yogadan kiya tha ,mishra ne kaha ki ab tak teen baar kendra main bijepi ke netritv main rajg kii sarkaar bani he or teenon baar uttar pradesh kaa yogadan sabase zyada rahaa he

 It is difficult to say whether there are more engineering colleges or mango orchards in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh
 vahaan aaj bhi wipro technologies ke ek haai-flying recruiter-rasel purushottaman ke bare main ek kahani gunj rahi he
 In Nunna village, half an hour away from the city, when someone names Purushothaman, the placement officer slows down his voice to a level of whispering
 gaanv main kam-se-kam paanch ejineering college hai
 a few years ago Purushothaman was like a messiah here
 achaanak gaayab ho jane ke pehle tak vah kisi bhi anya recruiter se adhik chaatro ko bhartee karata tha or unhen ooncha vetan dilwaataa tha
 According to a former colleague of his, he was very 'vicious'
 kathith taur par vah naukariyaan bechaa karata tha, college visit karne ke 7
 5 lakhs
 or prayek ofer letters ke 50,000 rupye uskaa khel tab khatm hua, jab uske ek sahyogi ne akhbaar main ek college ke vigyaapan ko dekha or usne shikaayat kar di
 The advertisement featured pictures of students who were selected by Wipro
 inamen se ek tasviir ek ladki kii thi, jise is shikaayat karne vaale ne riject kar diya tha
 When more dead bodies were dug, Wipro officials summoned Purushothaman to Bangalore and after being questioned for six hours, reprimanded him
 iske alaava, company ne hyderabad ke madhapur police stesan main dhokhadhadi kaa maamla bhi daayar kar diya
 The matter is under court consideration
 police adhikari is baat kii pushti karte hai ki wipro ne purushottaman ke khilaaf maamla darj karaayaa he
 When reporters revealed the subject in an email, Subhashini Pattabhiraman, a member of Wipro's Media Relations team, responded by taking measures to avoid recruitment fraud, efforts to bring public awareness and other possible corruption in HR Given the details of the strategy to stop the regions
 is dastavej ke 603 shabdon main rasel yaa purushottaman kaa zikr nahin tha
 Coincidentally, the case came up for appearance in the 11th Metropolitan Magistrate's court on 9 August and was then given the date of 8 October for hearing
 100 percent placement kii bhukham taur par thag recruiters or placement salaahkaaron ke jaal main ve college funsate hai, jo manyata praapt nahin hote hai, or aise kshetron main sthit hote hai, jahaan jane maane recruiters kii awajahi kam hoti he
 They need recruiters to attract students and students will only come when recruiters arrive
 aise main aate hai kuch madadgaar, bichauliye, bhrasht karmchaaree, college ke adhikari jo rishwat dene ke liye taiyaar hote hai
 They encourage colleges to announce '100% placement' and guaranteed salary to the world
 shodh reporton ke mutabik, profeshnal collejon ke paas outs main se chand hi sidhe rojgaar ke laayak hote hai
 a recent study conducted by the testing and evaluation company, Maritrack, said that excluding the top 25, out of 2,264 mbas from 100 institutions, only 21 per cent found hiring companies to be employable
 ek or acesment company aspiring minds ke anusaar, ejineering graduates ke 17
 Less than 5 percent can be employed in IT
 aise main ''100 percent placement '' ke kisi bhi daawey ko andeh kii najar se dekha janaa chahie
 But you can say this to such anxious parents, who consider an MBA or engineering degree to be a ladder for their child to reach unending wealth
 aise main bichauliye khush hai
 Colleges pay for their travel, stay and other requirements

 Blew away

 They ask why some companies are not coming to my college when they are visiting the neighboring college
 ve kehete hai, 'unhen paise de do, kisi bhi keemat par company lekar aao
 Colleges say that under pressure from parents, unethical behavior in placements begins
 placement ke badale rishwatahaalanki apni taraf se college bhi mata-pita kii baat maanane ke liye taiyaar rahete hai or agar rishwat dene se placement miltaa ho, to rishwat dene ke liye jarurat se zyada taiyaar rahete hai
 More than 15 placement officials from rural engineering colleges in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh reported that their placements fall between 20 and 60 per cent in a good year
 gramin college, vishesh rup se ve jo pichley paanch-chah varshon main bane hai, bade recruiters ko apane campus main laane ke liye jujhte hai
 They bribe HR personnel, enlist the help of middlemen, and result in inviting fake companies
 bharat ke ek sabase garib jile-orissa ke gajpati main college chalaane vaale centurian uniwarsity of technology and management ke sah-sansthaapak mukti mishra kehete hai, ''wipro tak sidhe pahunchane main sabhi prayaason ke baavjood asafal hone ke baad, mujhe bichauliyon kaa rasta pakadana padaa
 The middleman, which was imposed at the end of last year, has so far failed to bring Wipro or any other company of that level to Centurion
 purushottaman prakaran ke baad wipro ne echaar prakriya sakht bana di he
 She comes for recruitment only when the college is accredited or in a panel of top level companies
 ek gramin college or bangaloru sthit ek bichauliye ke bich hua samajhaita ankhen khol dene vaala he
 Neither of these two can be named, as middlemen have threatened the college to bear the consequences and commit suicide
 is samajhaite ke tahat kaha gaya he ki wipro or tisies main manyata shuru karwaane ke liye college 10 lakh ru
 Will give as advance
 jab yah baat tisies ko bataai gai, to company ne kaha ki usne ''uske jaise kisi vyakti ke bare main kabhi nahin suna he
 "wipro says he has nothing to do with this middleman, while this middleman claims to have hired at least 30,000 graduates in the last decade
" collejon ke liye is tarah ke bichauliyon ke jaal ko khaarij kar dena itnaa aasaan nahin he
 In fact, they are being forced to raise it
 placement adhikari kehete hai ki paisa yaa bhent die bagaiyr koi kaam nahin hota he
 When the HR teams of companies go to remote camps, the colleges pay for their tickets and stay
 jab ofer letters milte hai, to ve mobile phone, tablets or yahaan tak ki sona dekar ehsaan chukaate hai
 All this is done in the hope that they will come back next year and do a large number of recruits
