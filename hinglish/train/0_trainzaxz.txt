 directed by Anurag singh!!a post shared bykaran Johar(@karanjohar) ondec 16, 2018 at 9:44pm pstcowi film he kalank
 Karan Johar is making period drama for the first time
 is film main varun dhawan, aalia bhatta, sanjay dutt, maadhuri dikshit, sonakshi sinha or aditya roy kapur najar aaenge
 The fifth film is Good News
 is film main akshay kumaar or karina kapur khan samet kiyaara adwani or dilajit dosanjh najar aane vaale he
 If you look at the old record of Karan Johar's films, he has made a comeback at the box office
 aise main phul antertenment kii dose dene ke liye karan johar kaa production house ek baar phir taiyaar he
 The tradition of announcing an auction by playing dugduggi or putting money on it may be closed
 is tarah se janata ko aakarshik karne ke apane phaayde hote honge par bazaar niamak sebi ko lagata he ki ye tareeke beete jamaane kii baat ho gaye hai or aaj ke samay main nae tareekon se behatar parinaam dekhne ko mil sakate hai
 In fact, the stock and securities market regulator Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has the right to recover fees by defaulting in fees or by selling assets of non-paying units as ordered
 in adhikaron kii samiksha ke samay nilaamee ke dauraan apanaae jane vaale in puraane tareekon kii baat saamne ai
 According to the news agency PTI, officials said that SEBI is consulting the Finance Ministry to prepare new rules of recovery in respect of fines, fees, recovery amount or refund order
 sebi ke paas karj kii kistein chukaane main chook karne vaale difolter kii sampatti or bank khate jabt karne, difolter ko giraftaar karne yaa use hiraasat main lene or difolter kii chal evam achal sampattiyon ke prabandhan ke liye kisi ko niyukt karne kaa adhikaar he
 According to the official, Sebi said in a presentation before the government, 'some provisions of the Income Tax Act have become outdated, such as playing drums and public auction
 akhabaaron main vigyaapan or i-nilaamee jaise naye tareeke behatar parinaam de sakate hai
 'SEBI has asked the government to make necessary amendments in the rules to implement fast and effective methods of recovery
 iti act ke maujuuda praavdhaanon ke tahat kisi bhi sampatti ko jabt karne se pehle kisi jane-maane sthaan yaa jabt kii jane vaali sampatti ke paas dugadugi pitwa kar yaa munaadi (pukaar) lagava kar kurki aadi ke aadesh kii ghoshnaa kerani hoti he
 Apart from this, the order of confiscation has to be affixed in the premises of the said property at a clearly visible place to the public and on the board of the office of the Tax Recovery Officer
 mantralay ne sebi ke suzav ke jawaab main kaha ki iti act ke vasuuli ke praavdhaanon ko sebi adhinium ke tahat sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he or yah adhikaar centre sarkaar ke paas he
 Therefore, it should be amended only on the basis of rules made by the Central Government
 iske alaava sebi ne apane mukhyalay ke liye 'bambai' shabd kii jagah 'mumbai' istemaal karne kaa bhi praavdhaan rakhaa he
 SEBI had decided about a year ago that as a market intermediary, it would end the sub-broker category and accordingly changes were made to the rules
 isliye sebi ne suzav diya he act main se 'sab brokar' shabd ko bhi hataaya jaae
 Meerut SSP Dinesh Chandra Dubey has taken the role of Achanak Singham
 wo kabhi bhi kahin bhi pahunch jate hai
 Strict look at their employees
 police waalon ko ab ve kaam karnaa sikhaa rahe hai
 All the policemen of the district are scared of this new style of SSP
 meerut ke esaspi dinesh chandra dube mangalvaar klychanak mahila thane pahunchagaye
 Nobody came to know that Captain Saheb would raid the police station
 magar aisa hi hua
 Suddenly, seeing the SSP in front, the police personnel were blown away
 esaspi ne puure thane kaa muyna kiya
 The SSP got angry after seeing irregularities in the police station
 unhone mahila thane ke saare stoff kii class lenaa shuru kar di
 SSP, seen in film style, even called the police personnel unscrupulous
 media ke saamne fatkaar se mahila thane kaa stoff apamaanit mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 The heads of all the police personnel present in the police station bowed with shame
 esaspi ne mahila thane main tainaat purush pulicekarmiyon ko tatkaal hataane ke aadesh die
 And handing over the list of all of them to SP Crime said that they are all mandarins and brokers
 esaspi dinesh chandra dube kaa kahana tha ki mahila thane kaa prabandhan behatar banane ke liye shashan ne aadesh jari kiye hai
 According to them, women in-charge and staff are being deployed in the women's police station
 janata kii samasyaon kaa sheeghra nistaaran karne vaale pulicekarmio ko hi thane main tainaati di jaayegi
 The SSP heard the order for immediate removal of Rashmi Chaudhary, in-charge of the Mahila Police Station and Vandana Mishra, the CO Women's Police Station
 unhone thane kaa prabhaar inspector naragis khan ko de diya
 While DSP Abdul Qadir was also made CO of Mahila Police Station

 ” beshak is saal queen or maradaani jaisi vimen oriented filmein box offis par sikaa jamaa chuki hai

 (input bhashaa se) In the new year 2017, the trinity of Sun, Earth and Moon will show four exciting scenes of eclipse to the world's astrophysicists
 haalanki, bharat main inamen se keval do khagoleey ghatnaon ke najar aane kii ummid he
 Superintendent of Ujjain's prestigious Jivaji Observatory, Dr
 rajendraprakash gupt ne bhartiya sandarbh main kii gai kalganana ke anusaar bataaya ki aagaamee varsh mengrahanon kii adbhutkhagoleey ghatnaon kaa silsilaa 11 farvari ko lagane vaale upachhaya chandragrahan se shuru hoga
 This first eclipse of New Year will be seen in India
 bataa den ki upachhayachandragrahantab lagata he, jab chandramaa penumbra (grahan ke vakt dharti kii parchaai kaa halkaa bhaag) se hokar gujarata he
 At this time the sunlight falling on the moon appears to be partially cut off and the eclipse can be seen as a blurred shadow falling on the Kochundrama
 gupt ne bataaya ki varsh 2017 main 26 farvari ko valayakaar suryagrahan lagegaa
 However, this exciting view of the Sun, Earth and Moon will not be visible in India
 takreeban do sadi puraani vedhashala ke adheekshak ne bataaya ki aagaamee saat agast ko lagane vaale aanshikachandragrahan kaa najaara bharat mendekha ja sakegaa
 Gupta said that the complete solar eclipse on August 21 is awaiting astrophysicists from all over the world
 baharhaal, varsh 2017 kaa yah aakhri grahan bharat main najar nahin aayega
 a complete solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes between the sun and the earth in such a way that the sun appears completely hidden in the moonlight when it is seen from the earth

 for the post of female constable in Aligarh Muslim University Vacancy for Account Officer in musalmaan hone par kendrit apane ek lekh par uthe vivaad se chintit bollywood abhinayta shahrukh khan ne kaha he ki unhone hameshaa dharmanirpekshata, dharmik sahishnutaa, vinodpurn maahaul kaa samarthan kiya he lekin unhen lagata he ki unhen ab sirf 100 karod rupee kaa vyavsaay karne vaali filmon or apni abhinetriyon ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 Citing his articles in Outlook magazine's Turning Point and the New York Times, he said it was a secular and enjoyable article
 shahrukh ne kaha, 'yah kisi or cheez ke bare main baat nahin karata
 This is a very secular and enjoyable article
 yah maine apane bacchon ke liye likhaa or kaha ki unhen yah padhanaa chahie
 Reacting to this article by Shah Rukh, Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik had asked the Indian government to provide security to Shah Rukh while India's Information Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari and Home Secretary R
K
 ke
 Singh had said that India has the ability to take care of its affairs
 apane is lekh par upje vivaad se pareshaan shahrukh ne kaha, 'mere liye jindagi kaaphi acchhee or dhanya rahi he lekin kuch chijen aisi hai jiskaa maine samarthan kiya he or chahta hum ki log ise jaane
 i have also supported secularism, religious tolerance, humorous atmosphere and sports and i want people to know this
 lekin jab is tarah kii chijen hoti hai, tab mujhe mahasoos hota he ki aap mere 100 karod kii film or uski abhinetri ke bare main hi sunanaa chaahate hai, or ab isi bare main baat karunga
 According to Shah Rukh, in this article he was talking about the traditionalist notion about Pathan and Muslim which he is not
 unhone kaha, 'khan yaa pathan ke liye teen chijen jaruri maani jaati hai
 The first is tall and saddled and dull in appearance, which i am not
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki musalamaanon ko aam insaan kii tarah hona chahie or teesri baat yah ki agar aap ek prasiddh hasti hai, to aapako khaas tareeke se vyavhaar karnaa chahie jo main nahin karata
 Despite writing pessimistic things about me, i wrote that, i have not been pessimistic because of the love i got from my country and suddenly i got this response
 'shahrukh ke mutabik vah khud ko bharat main surakshit mahasoos karte hai isliye unhone yah lekh likhaa
 Shah Rukh said, 'I feel completely safe and happy in this country
 ' Clearly, the proposal to legalize betting and gambling is complex and is neither agreed upon by political parties nor in the world of sports

 Along with this, many serious questions were raised on the manner of functioning of the party
 vahinsiem kejarivalane bhi shanivaar ko party kii haar par kuch galatiyon kaa zikr kiya tha
 The leaders are avoiding speaking anything
 After the statements of Zahir Haikumar, a lot of controversy has come to the fore within the Aam Aadmi Party
 sutron kii maane to guuruuvaar ko hui piesi kii baithak main kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 Several leaders, including party leaders Kumar Vishwas and Ashutosh, showed their tough attitude to the PAC
 haalanki piesi kii baithak main hue bavaal par sabhi netaa khamosh hai or ise party kaa andruni maamla bataakar kuch bhi bolne se batch rahe hai
 Therefore, the postponed PAC meeting reports showed that after the meeting of the same PAC, all differences came to the fore
 ravivaar ko prastaavit piesi kii baithak main party ko haar kii samiksha ke saath netritv or aagaamee rajyon main party ke chunaav ladane ke sabhi pahaluon par charchaa honi thi
 But due to the fact that such situation does not happen again within the party, the party has postponed its most important PAC meeting for a few days

 As soon as the name of BJP comes, the Muslim of the country starts making mouth and shrinking nose and eyebrow, then there is a smile on the face of Gujarati Muslims
 gujarat kii ground riyality bataati he ki 2002 ke dange ke dard ko bhuulakar gujarat ke musalamaanon ne bijepi ko gale lagaaya he
 This is the reason that in the last assembly election 2012, BJP had won the victory of more than a dozen Muslim majority seats
 khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kehete hai ki gujarat main har paanch se ek muslim bijepi ko vot detaa he, yani 20 fisadi muslim bijepi ke saath he
 In Gujarat, 9 percent of the Muslim assembly seats have been set in Gujarat
 bijepi gujarat kii satta ko barkaraar rakhane kii jaddojahad main lagi he
 Gujarat has around 9 per cent Muslim voters
 rajya ke 182 vidhansabha siton main 25 siten aisi hai, jahaan muslim matadaata kisi bhi raajnneetik party banane or bigaadane kaa kuvat rakhte hai
 In view of this, all the political parties are eyeing these Muslim votes
 gujarat main mahaj do muslim vidhayak hai
 Gujarat's Patidar, Dalit and OBC sections are currently considered angry with the BJP in the name of Muslims
 bijepi isaki bharpai ke liye gujarat ke liye muslim maton ko saadhane main jute gai he
 The Gujarat government has recently named many housing societies after Muslims
 ahmedabad ke rakhiyal kshetra ke maujuud houseing socity kaa naam daara shikoh apartment or ramakrishna mail ke paas maujuud houseing socity kaa naam vir abdul hamid apartment rakhaa he
 The Muslim voters of Gujarat, who have 17 BJP seats in the Muslim majority 25 seats, have been a traditional voter of Congress before the 2007 assembly elections
 lekin 2007 ke baad bijepi ne congress ke is votbank main sendhamari kii he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, BJP got about 20 percent of the vote of Muslims
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa he ki 25 muslim bahulya siton main 17 siton par bijepi or 9 siton par congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 BJP occupies Congress seats, BJP state president of BJP Minority Front Sufi Mehboob Ali Chisti told Aaj Tak - seats like Muslim majority Vagra, Jambusar, Dabhoi, Curzon, Padra, Dholka, Jamnagar, Bhunj, Anjara, Mangrol, Junagadh, Roskot Has succeeded in winning
 ye sabhi siten bijepi ne target banaakar congress se chhini thi
 These were the seats that BJP used to lose to Congress by 5 to 7 thousand votes
 gujarat main bijepi ke 200 se adhik nagar parshad muslim hai or usamen lagbhag 100 chairman muslim hai
 Modi enhanced Gujarat's Haj Kotahj The most applications of Muslims visiting Yatra come from Gujarat
 2014 se pehle gujarat kaa kota mahaj 4 hajaar tha
 The chairman of the Gujarat Haj Committee several times demanded the UPA government to increase Gujarat's quota, but the government did not raise it
 2014 main jab narendra modi pradhanmantri bane to gujarat ke haj yatriyon kaa kota har saal badhaayaa
 In the last three years, this quota has increased from 4 thousand to 15 thousand
 gujarat danga or karfu muktasufi mehboob ali chishti ne kaha-bijepi sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauran gujarat ke 5 lakh muslim bijepi ke primary sadsy bane hai
 He said that in the last 15 years, Gujarat has become riot and curfew free under BJP rule
 jabaki congress ke daur main ek bhi saal aisa nahin gujara jab danga na hua ho
 He said what security and development do Muslims want
 gujarat main donon musalamaanon ko mil rahaa he
 Sufi Mehboob Ali Chisti said that the condition of Muslims of Gujarat is better than other Muslims of the country
 gujarat ke sarkari naukariyon main musalamaanon kii 9 fisadi bhagidaari, gujarat police main 10
 Muslims have a literacy rate of 5 per cent and Muslims 80 per cent, which is comparable to Hindus in Gujarat
 unhone kaha ki gujarati muslimon ne kaarobaar main bhi kaaphi tarakkee kii he
 The 15 point program for the development of minorities has been better implemented in Gujarat
 iske liye upie sarkaar ne gujarat ko good grad diya tha
 The Congress-ruled states lagged behind there
 modi ne alpsankhyak vikaas vitt nigam ke jariye muslimon kii madadsufi mehboob ali chishti ne bataaya ki gujarat alpsankhyak vikaas vitt nigam ko atal bihari bajpeyi sarkaar ke dauraan 60 hajaar karod karj diya tha
 After this, the UPA government continued to ask for help but they did not give up and said that Gujarat should pay 32 crore interest of the loan taken earlier
 modi sarkaar ne satta main aate hi byaaj ko maaf kiya or 20 hajaar karod rupee elart kiya he
 Due to this 100 Muslim students have been sent abroad to study MBBS, Engineering, Management
 sendhamari kii firaaq main bijepiye baat maani jaati he ki muslim bijepi ko vot nahin karata lekin haal ke dinon main bijepi muslimon ke bich bantwaaraa karke sendhamari karne kii firaaq main he
 BJP has tried to draw the Muslims associated with Sufi ideology
 teen talaak jaise mudde ko khadaa kar muslim mahilaon kaa vot bijepi ko pade isaki bhi ranneeti ban rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi is silent on the issue of Muslims in Gujarat
 congress ke muslim muddon par aankh band rakhane or soft hindutv vaali image ke kaaran congress se musalamaanon kaa ek bada tabaka naaraaz mana ja rahaa he
 BJP bets on Muslim candidate? In 2017 assembly elections, BJP may break the ritual of not giving tickets to Muslims; Imran Khedawala, the current independent councilor and former councilor of Jamalpur, can beat the Congress against Jamalpur seat by wearing saffron
 jamalpur seat par musalamaanon kii sankhya lagbhag 65 fisadi he
 According to sources, for the last three months, several meetings have been held between BJP National President Amit Shah and Imran Khedawala
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki jab tak narendra modi pradhanmantri hai or desh main bijepi kii sarkaar he tab tak essi, asti ke samvidhan pradutt aarakshan ke adhikaar ko duniya kii koi bhi takat chin nahin sakati he
 Addressing the Baba Chaharmal Jayanti function held at Ravindra Bhawan in Patna, Sushil Modi said, "the central government will file a review petition next week against the recent order of the Supreme Court regarding the SC, ST Atrocities Prevention Act
" bijepi jahaan essi, asti ko krimi layer ke daayre main laane kii virdohi he vahiin pronnati main aarakshan, akhil bhartiya nyaayik seva ke gathan kii himachati he
 Sushil Modi said that SC, ST Prevention of Atrocities Act is a weapon due to which anyone is afraid to persecute Dalits
 durupyog ke naam par kisi bhi kanoon ko kamjor or shithil nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The central government stands completely with the Dalits in relation to the Supreme Court order
 unhoneesasi, asti atyaachaar nivaaran kanoon ko samvidhan kii 9veen anusuchimen rakhane kii maang kii taaki aage se koi court usamen hastkshep nahin kar sake
 The BJP leader said that his party favored reservation in the promotion of SC, ST
 unhone kaha ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar daliton ke liye promoshan main aarakshan lagu kiya tha
 This system was also implemented in Bihar, but it was repealed by the Supreme Court
 rajya sarkaar phir se use lagu karaane kaa prayaas karegi
 Sushil Modi said, Section 312 of the Constitution provides that the Central Government can ensure the representation of SC / ST by constituting All India Judicial Service, the Prime Minister has also said that this issue should be debated in the country
 ambedkar ke naam par di safaiupi main samvidhan nirmaataa baba sahab ambedkar ke naam main 'ram' shabd jode jane par bhi susheel modi ne safai di
 He said that there has been no tampering of Baba Saheb's name, but the government of Uttar Pradesh has directed his use in government documents which he himself has written on the original copy of the constitution
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki samvidhan kii mul prati main baba sahab ne apana puraa naam ‘bhimrao raamji ambedkar’kaa hastakshar kiya he
 In Maharashtra, it is customary to write the father's name along with the name
 baba sahab ke pita kaa naam raamji tha
 The government of Uttar Pradesh has issued a mandate to direct the use of this full name in all government records
 kuch log is par hangaamaa kar rahe hai, jo uchit nahin he

 Mehbooba Mufti ji, you might want to check how your members voted on this bill before tweeting
 i understand they abstained which helped the government with the numbers needed to pass the bill
 You can’t help the government & then “fail to understand need to pass”!https: / / t

 Even before kindergarten it is decided that the child will become an engineer, now here 'ask the child what he wants?' Remove the stereotyped thing; In the coming years, the word 'engineer' is heard so often that someone moves the jaw a little bit and touches the palate with a tongue propped on the lower lip
 
 'before that, the child has repeated about seven times the entrance test of seven hours, eighteen crash courses, from fee structure to infrastructure of ten-fifteen institutes across the country
 kuntha tab upajati he, jab college pahunchakar varna vyavastha ke bare main pataa chalata he, iaiti vaale savarna hai shesh sabhi paamar
 Believe it, except for the iits, even if you talk about taking admission in an engineering college, then it will be treated as if you have accepted the idea of brahmana
 ye aparadhbodh kahaan jayega, ye kuntha kahin to niklegi na?chaar saal kii padhai main chalis-bayalis paper, darjanon practicals, major-miner projects, aprintis, saikadon seshanal or mid turm dene ke baad insaan main imoshan ke liye jagah kahaan bachati he? basant main jab sab madanotsav manaa rahe hote hai us vakt pakhwaade bhar na nahaakar practical kii file tipte kisi rampal ne doodh se nahaakar kheer bhakton main bantwa hi di to koun sa pahaad tut padaa? us nirih-niraapad-gabhuaar-bhatke hue arib kaa kya kasoor agar use semester ekjams ke dar se ejineering chhod iesas ke liye shauchalay saaf karne main zyada sukun mila? uttarapradesh main ‘yadav’ hona hi bahut kuch he is par bhi koi naam ke aage ‘ejeeniyar’ or peeche ‘singh’ ke saath hajaar-do hajaar karod or menten kar sake to use jail bhej dena kahaan tak nyaaysangat hoga? or sabase bura hua ‘mehadi masaroor biswas’ ke saath jitna bada uskaa naam he puraa naam lete tak main semester khatm ho jaae, first saim main seniors ne use is naam ko lekar kitna chidhaayaa hoga, aise kisi hatbhaage ne nanhe kute se ‘aies’ naam kaa acount chalaa hi liya to kya?jarurat he ejiniers ko mukhyadhara main laane kii, unhen ye bataane kii ki wo bhi hamamen se hi ek hai, chuttee ke dinon main unhen ped-paudhe or suraj dikhaane kii, iaiti main admician nahin milanaa kisi kii hatya karne jaisaa paap nahin he, maheene main kam se kam do baar unhen nahalaakar ye anubhav karaane kii ki pani jab sharir ko choota he to kaisaa lagata he?koding,asembler,compiler or ded line ke pher main fanson ko ye bataanaa jaruri he ki wo sirf programmer nahi hai, hindu-musalmaan kii ‘ghar vaapasi’ karaane vaale ejiniers ko kab vaapis laaenge? or sabase badi baat un par jokes bananaa kab band honge? samay he ki ham sab vakt rahete chet jaaen varanaa yun hi ejiniers apni khiz kheer, twitor acount, aies ke shauchalayon, karodon rupayon or half garlfriend ke rup main nikaalenge

 bowling ko ek kinare rakhkar har taraf ballebaajon kaa hi bolbalaa he or iske peeche vajah bhi sateek he kyonki tii20 puri tarah ballebaajon kaa hi khel mana jaataa he
 That is why the bowlers who drink big and big water in the test also get beaten up, whether it is Dale Steyn or someone else, but seeing the kind of bowling that Bumrah, Nehra, Ashwin and Bhuvneshwar bowled in Asia Cup, it is not difficult to say It will be that in this World T20 bowlers will definitely be able to leave their mark
 greece ko sarkari karj sankat se ubaarane ke liye europea sangh ke netaaon ke bich ek sahmati ban gai he
 Under this, banks will now accept half the amount of debt given to the government of Greece as their losses
 is tarah greece kii sarkaar par karj kaa boj ghatega
 After an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels, union president Herman Van Rompoy said on Thursday that Greece had reached an agreement with banks on government debt

 The agreement will reduce Greece's debt to 120% of its GDP by 2020

 yojana main 109 arab euro ke sarkari dhan or nijee pratibhutidharakon se ek acha-khaasaa sahyog lene ke alaava 110 arab euro ke raahat package kii baat kahi gai thi
 Banks had previously assumed that they would cover 21 per cent of Greece's debt in their spending, but in August, it became extremely important to adjust accounts as the crisis deepened
 kuch vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki bainkon ko 40 se 60 fisadi kharch ko apane khaaton main samyojit karnaa chahie jabaki anya kaa kahana he ki isse greece sankat kaa koi samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa
 Greece currently has a debt of 360 billion euros, but it is increasing further due to short-term debt
 desh kii videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne jis din pakistan par sansad main bayaan diya usee din mumbai hamalon ke mastermind samajhe jane vaale hafiz said ne twit kiya ki 7 saal baad bhi is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki pakistan kaa haath 26 / 11 ke mumbai hamalon main tha
 This brings back the question that Pakistan cannot silence voices like Hafiz Saeed
 tippaniyan Despite that recently, Sushma Swaraj went to Pakistan and announced that the continuation of the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan would continue, it also proved that it is a different thing to talk to the political regime in Pakistan, but the anti-india voices Will never stop such rules
 pakistan ne shuruyaat ke samay se hi 26 / 11 main apana haath hone se inkaar kiya tha is bare main anek saboot or dastavej dene ke baad bhi hafiz said usee baat ko doharaa rahaa he
 After Hafiz Saeed's statement, the question will always arise that what is the end result of talks with Pakistan
 iske baavjood ki haal main sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan jaakar yah ghoshnaa kii ki bharat or pakistan ke bich samgr vaarta kaa silsilaa jari rahegaa, yah is baat ko bhi sabit karata he ki pakistan main siyaasi hukumat se baat karnaa alag baat he, lekin bharat virdohi awaajon ko aisi hukuumaten kabhi nahin roak paaengi
 Hafiz Saeed is repeating the same thing, despite giving many proofs and documents that Pakistan had denied its hand in 26 / 11 since its inception
 hafiz said ke bayaan ke baad hameshaa yah sawaal uthta rahegaa ki pakistan se baatcheet kaa aakhirkaar nateeja kya nikalataa he

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday that he had not committed any mistake in the defamation case of the RSS and did not confess the crime
 iske ek din pehle hi rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya tha ki coca-cola ke sansthaapak pehle shikanji bechate the
 In the case of defamation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been charged by the Bhiwandi Court
 rahul ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 499 or 500 ke tahat aarope tay hua he
 Rahul Gandhi's knowledge of coca-cola, macdonald, Ford Motors, Mercedes Benz and Honda at Congress's OBC conference and his appearance in Bhiwandi court in defamation case are wrong timing for the opposition
 aise samay main jab vipakshi dal 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye endie ke khilaaf ekajute hone kii koshish kar rahe hai, rahul gandhi ke bayaan unki party or sambhavit sahyogi dalon ke aatmavishvaas ko kamjor karne vaale hai
 Congressmen are excited about the BJP coming to power in Karnataka
 uske baad haal main hue loksabhaa or vidhansabha upachunaavon main bhi bijepi ko kai siten ganvaani padin
 Especially Rahul Gandhi's statement that coca-cola was started by a shikanji question his being a mature politician
 congress adhyaksh ko lagaataar yah dikhaanaa hoga ki ve 2019 main vipaksh ke nirvivaad netaa banane ke laayak hai
 From time to time, Rahul Gandhi has also displayed the qualities of an emerging leader
 lekin iske pehle ki unke bare main log acchhee chhavi banaaen, vah khud hi kuch aisa kar daalate hai ki unki chhavi par batta lag jaataa he
 After returning from a 56-day rest in April 2015, Rahul Gandhi showed aggression and maturity
 unhone 'suut-boot kii sarkaar' jaise kai upamaaon se piem modi or bijepi par hamalaa kiya
 He played a key role in bringing the BJP a defensive position in the Gujarat elections last year
 mandiron ke unke daure or centre sarkaar kii khamiyaan ujagar karne se gujarat main congress ko phayda hua
 Recently, Rahul Gandhi also benefited from the success of Congress in Karnataka and by-elections
 yahaan tak ki unhone khud ko 2019 main piem kaa candidet bataa diya
 But two recent incidents have weakened Rahul Gandhi's fight against the BJP
 pehla, purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke nagpur aresas mukhyalay jane se is sanghathan ke khilaaf rahul kii ladaai kamjor padi he
 Rahul Gandhi has been very aggressive against the Sangh
 rahul ne aarope lagaaya tha ki, 'aresas ke logon ne mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii he
 On this statement of Rahul, an RSS volunteer from Bhiwandi in Maharashtra sued for defamation
 is silsile main rahul gandhi ko is saal do baar bhiwandi court main pesh hona padaa he
 His fight against the RSS has been blunt, his aggressive rhetoric and claims have also weakened his credibility
 gat 6 june ko empi main kisaanon kii firing main maut kii barsi par rahul gandhi mandsaur gaye
 In his speech there, he attacked the MP and the central government on many issues like food chains, manufacturing of mobile phones and employment
 lekin aapadaaon ke baad desh main udhyamita ke avasaron par rahul gandhi ke sawaal uthaane se unki hi chhavi kharaab hui he
 All this can be harmful for the Congress and those opposition parties who are trying to unite to fight the BJP in 2019
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani ke parijanon ke khilaaf kathith bhrashtachar or aniyamittaaon ke saboot hai lekin congress kabhi unhen pareshaan karne ke liye iskaa istemaal nahin karegi
 Digvijay Singh also dismissed allegations of collusion between Vadra, DLF and the Congress government of Haryana for giving undue advantages in land deals to Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi
 sonia kaa bachaav karte hue unhone kaha ki vah wadra kii ‘chartered accountint’ nahin hai jo unki badhati sampatti kaa hisaab rakhen
 Digvijay Singh said, 'many things came to light during the NDA government
 lekin keval main hi nahin, kya congress party ne kabhi unka istemaal kiya
 We will never use them
 agar main kahuun ki mere paas ye (vaajapeyi or adwani ke parijanon ke khilaaf saboot) nahin hai to yah sahi nahin hoga
 The Congress general secretary was asked questions about his statement that he had evidence against Vajpayee and Advani's relatives
 singh ne sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue yah bhi kaha ki unke paas jo sakshya hai unase bhrashtachar or aniyamitata ke aarope lagaaye ja sakate hai or donon varisht netaaon ke liye yah sharmindagi kii baat hogi
 The Congress General Secretary also said, 'leaders are human beings
 ham bhagwaan nahin hai
 We cannot monitor or prevent our countless relationships
 ’jab singh se poocha gaya ki vah vaajapeyi or adwani ke rishtedaaron ke khilaaf sabooton ko ujagar kyon nahin kar rahe to unhone kaha, ‘main shikayati kyon banuun
 According to Singh, there are many authorities and Parliament to look into such cases
 wadra ke khilaaf aaropon ko khaarij karte hue singh ne kaha ki dlef-wadra jameen saudon ko lekar lagaaye gayi aarope sahi nahin hai
 When Digvijay Singh was asked whether Sonia was aware of Vadra's rising wealth and whether he ever questioned it, Singh said whether the work of keeping the accounts of the son-in-law was also done by the mother-in-law
 ’unhone kaha, ‘sonia gandhi rabart wadra kii chartered accountint nahin hai
 He said whether Sonia Gandhi has ever talked to the Chief Minister or ministers about Vadra? You cannot target Sonia Gandhi for work that she did not do
 singh ne kaha, ‘main netaa hum
 But it is not my job to see what my relatives do
 ’ digvijay ke anusaar unke bhi chaar betiyaan-damaad hai lekin ve kya kar rahe hai isse unhen matlab nahin he
 To the questions asked repeatedly about the land deals between DLF and Vadra, Singh said that DLF should answer this
 unhone kaha, ‘sonia gandhi isamen kahaan se aa gayin
 Asked about the rapid increase in his wealth after Vadra's marriage to the Gandhi family, Singh said, "if someone bought land in Haryana 10 years ago, its value would have increased 100 times now
" ’unhone kaha ki wadra ek pratishthit parivaar se aate hai or aisa nahin he ki priyanka gandhi se shaadi karne se pehle unke paas koi sampatti nahin thi
 Singh also dismissed the notion that Ashok Khemka, an IAS officer from Haryana, was transferred to the country because he started investigating Vadra's land deals
 unhone kaha, ‘kya wadra ne khemka ke khilaaf shikaayat kii
 The Chief Secretary called Khemka and Khemka said that he was completely satisfied
 ’wadra ke ‘mango main in bananaa republic’ sambandhi vivaadaaspad bayaan ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki pehla shabd ‘aam aadmi’ kaa shabdic anuwaad he or isamen bahut hasyabodh haiy lekin unhone mana ki duusare shabd (bananaa republic) kaa istemaal sahi nahin he
 Digvijay also brushed aside the notion that the Vadra case has damaged the image of the Congress and the Gandhi family
 unhone kaha ki dlef or haryana sarkaar ne aaropon par binduvaar tathy pesh kiye hai

 bhaajapa shasit teenon rajyon main congress se pichhadane par party kaaryakarta niraash hai lekin bhaajapa netritv niraash se adhik chintit he
 The general reason for not being worried is that the BJP is backward in three states but because the Congress solidified itself in the three states of the Hindi belt
 yadi rajasthan ko chhod bhi diya jaae (jahaan amuman paanch saal main sarkaar badalati he) madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main pandrah saal baad congress ke liye siyaasi jameen hari ho gai he

 In both these states, Congress had no face in terms of organization and leadership

 ek tarah se 2019 ke liye hindi pattee ke rajyon main congress ko bhaajapa se muqabla karne liye ek bada aadhaar mil gaya he
 As the exercise for the formation of a grand alliance against the BJP has started for 2019, the establishment of the Congress in the Hindi belt is a matter of concern for the BJP in political terms

 BJP leaders are hopeful that the court verdict in the Babri demolition case will come in their favor
 maamle main kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ko bhi ummid he ki adaalat kii ore se adwani samet sabhi bijepi netaaon ko clin chit mil jaaegi
 He said that Advani and Joshi would prove to be impeccable
 iske alaava sadhvi ritambhra ne kaha, 'mujhe ummid he ki court jald se jald is par nirnay degaa
 The charges have been leveled by the CBI
 court main tathy unako pesh karne hai
 The court will do its job

 Therefore, a murder case should be held against him
 bhadakaau bhaashan dene ke aarope ke sawaal par katiyaar ne kaha ki ayodhya main kisi ko bhaashan dene kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 The platform that was built was far from the structure
 dhaanche par chadh gaye, ham logon ko kaise rokte
 He said that Advani had sent Uma Bharti to stop the car servants
 aaropon kaa koi aadhaar nahin: kanoon rajya mantri peepi choudharikanoon rajya mantri peepi choudhary kaa kahana he ki adwani, joshi or uma bharti sahit 12 logon par aarope tay hone kaa matlab yah nahin he ki inke paas koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 Trial will run and trial will be held
 jaisaa ki adwani ji ne bhi kaha he ki unke upar koi aarope nahin he
 This is true
 ye sabhi log bari ho jaaenge, chhot jaaenge
 Because there is no such conspiracy case
 120bi kahin is maamle main thahartaa nahin he
 All these leaders will now speak in this matter in court
 peepi choudhary kaa maananaa he ki in aaropon kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Evidence will be needed to prove this allegation
 isliye meraa maananaa he ki isamen koi dam nahin he or yah sab chhot jaaenge
 This is not a case of conspiracy
 uma bharti ne thik kaha he ki sab khullamakhulla hua he
 Therefore, there is no power in this case

 Almost every sector is witnessing a huge decline, but even at such a time an industry is flourishing
 ham baat kar rahe hai bollywood industry kii jo is saal alag hi mood main najar aa rahi he
 It is true that there are worrisome conditions about the country's economy, but even at such times, people are coming out of the house and watching movies, and not only watching but also having a lot of fun
 ab aisa daawa ham nahin kar rahe hai
 Rather, if we look at the films released this year, it is known that this year has proved to be excellent in terms of box office collection
 is saal kai aisi filmein relies hui hai jinhone box offis par jamkar kamai kii he
 If you talk about the films released in the last 6 months, then the figure that comes out is staggering
 pichley 6 maheene membollywoodfilmon ne lagbhag 1,565 karod kaa bijness kar daalaa he
 This includes superhit films like Saaho, Chichhore, War, Bala, Dream Girl, Housefull 4, Mission Mangal
 kamaal kii baat to ye bhi rahi ki inamen kuch filmein bani to kaaphi kam bajet main thim lekin phir bhi unhone 100 karod club main entry maar lee
 The recession has no effect on the Bollywood industry? Looking at these data, the question is whether the recession has no effect on the Bollywood industry? Now it is necessary to understand here that a good collection of Bollywood films does not mean that the economy of the country is running
 balki ye bas dikhaata he ki log apana mood acha karne or manoranjan ke liye filmein dekhne jate rahete hai
 In simple words, the audience likes to watch films whose content is good
 aise main content driven filmein to puure saal banati hi rahati hai, chaahe desh kii arthvyavastha acchhee ho yaa buree
 This is the reason that despite being a weak economy in 2019, the Bollywood industry continued to have silver
 yaad dilaa den ki aisa hi daur saal 2008 main bhi aayaa tha
 At that time the country was facing recession but it did not have any effect on the Bollywood industry
 us saal film industry 7
 Proceeded at 7% pace
 ab kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mil rahaa he is saal, jo ye sabit karata he ki agar badhiya content vaali filmein banati rahengi to box offis par banpar kamai kaa silsilaa bhi jari rahegaa

 a statement by Salman Khan regarding the shooting of the film 'sultan' has come under controversy
 ek online website ne salmaan ke hawaale se likhaa ki unhone shooting ke dauraan apni thakaavat kii tulana 'rape victim' ke dard se kii
 Although now questions are being raised on this interview itself
 bataaya jaataa he ki website ne salmaan ke bayaan ko todmarodakar pesh kiya, jisase vivaad hua
 Actually, it has now been revealed on the interview on social media that the website did not write the entire conversation of Salman, only a part of it has been revealed
 ab soshal websites par intervyuu kaa doosraa hissaa saamne aayaa he, jisamen salmaan apni baat ko agali kii line main durust kar rahe hai
 Audio: Proof that @ beingsalmankhanhear and decide for yourselfpic
 twitter
 com / novdhlp6fl # salmanmisquoted — Kush (@beingkushmehta) June 21, 2016 Notably, it was reported earlier that Salman in an interview with 'spotboy
com' that the shooting fatigue of 'sultan' was like a rape Victim
 actor ke is bayaan kii bijepi netaa shaayna ensi ne kadi ninda kii
 He said that Salman should apologize for this statement
 padhein, kya kaha salmaan ke bayaan par pita saleem khan nemahila ayog ne maanga javabanational vuman kamishan kii adhyaksh lalita kumaar mangalam ne kaha ki ayog kii ore se salaaman ko chitthee likhi gai he
 It asks why he made such a statement
 agar 7 dinon ke andar jawaab nahin aata he or encidblu ko unke jawaab se santushti nahin milti he to aage saman bhi jari kiya ja saktaa he
 In an interview to Salman Khan'sspotboy
com, he was talking about his upcoming film 'sultan'
 vah kehete hai,'sultan kii training, phir dhul mitti main shooting, ection or in sab ke bich shooting
 After all this there was a lot of fatigue
 uske baad main jab chalata hum to aisa lagata he jaise aap rape peedita jaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 However, i should not say so
 'kya likhaa gaya intervyuu mendusri ore, website ne intervyuu ke hawaale se likhaa, 'mere liye ring main dangal karnaa bahut mushkil kaam tha
 One day we had to shoot continuously for six hours
 is dauraan mujhe ground main kaaphi uthapatak kerani thi
 It was not easy for me, because during this time i had to slice a 120 kg man in 10 different angles
 mujhe bhi kai baar ground par pataka gaya
 When i was getting out of the ring after the shoot, i thought that i am a woman who has been raped
 main sidhe bilkul nahin chal paa rahaa tha
 i ate something after that, straightened my head and then went for training
 'saleem khan ne kiya salmaan kaa bachaavsalim khan nesalmanka bachaav karte hue kaha ki salmaan ne aisa kisi galat iraade se nahin kaha tha
 He said this in the conversation
 dekhen: trailor launch par salmaan or anoushka kii pahalavanipadhen: 'sultan' kaa 'ham dil de chuke sanam' se he ye conection'salmaan khan maafee maange'salmaan ke is bayanki bijepi netaa shaayna ensi ne kadi ninda kii he
 He said that Salman should apologize for this statement
 shaayna ne twit karke salmaan ko maafee maangane ko kaha
 Rape is an exercise of power to destruct a woman's self esteem, frm wht i knw of @ beingsalmankhanhe respects # womenso he must apologize

 Salman should apologize
 vah apana bayaan waapas len, kyonki unke bayaan ko lakhon log follow kar sakate hai
 Tej Pratap Yadav, elder son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and Bihar Health Minister, feels that the app launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for cashless payments recently is named 'VIM'

 Recently, the BHIM app launched by Prime Minister Modi for cashless payment and which has been downloaded by more than 30 lakh people in the last 5 days

 He wrote the VIM app referring to the Twitter BHIM app
 BHIM ap ko lekar tej pratap kii jaankaree ke bare main jaise hi twitor par logon ne padhaa vaise hi vah twitor istemaal karne waalon ke nishane par aa gaye
 On Tejapratap's tweet, people wrote that Lalu Prasad and his family have always used Baba Bhimrao Ambedkar, in whose name the BHIM app has been launched, for his own political gains and in such a way, Tej Pratap at least has his name There should be correct information about kisi twitor yujar ne likhaa 'VIM nahin BHIM kam se kam us aadmi ke naam or uski ssailing ke bare main to jaaniye jiskaa aapke parivaar waalon ne hameshaa raajnneetik phayda uthaaya he
 Shameful !!

 He was a great hero in the early seventies, yet Amitabh Bachchan's luminous and cold-blooded personality made him feel that his role in the film industry was ignored
 rajesh khanna 'kool' nahin the
 He was like a naive middle-class boy
 ve clasik handsam nahin balki sughad the
 He often looked strange in his tight safari suit and slightly stiff hair
 lekin jis pal ve gardan halaki-si jhukaakar muskaraate or camere kii ore dekhakar palken jhapakaate, unka aakarshan asahneeya ho jaataa or mahilaayein sard aahen bharne lagati thim
 Such a moment seemed to be his own life and his naive personality would directly connect a close relationship with his loved ones
 unki saadhaaran chhavi, maasoom adaa or mohak aakarshan kul milakar maarak ban jate the
 It was this style that convinced the fans at the end of the film Daag (director: Yash Chopra, 1973) that it can be peaceful even after two marriages and this is very common
 doosraa koun aisa kar saktaa tha?ve aam taur par madhya yaa ucch madhya varg ke kirdaar nibhaate the, jinhen akasar parivaar kaa sahaara nahin hota tha or pyaar kii talash main jo gumsum se jakhmi dil pade rahete the
 There was also an anger in the pain of such characters, which would be narrated by drunken on the screen and through great songs
 masalan kati patang (nirdeshkah shakti samant, 1970) kaa ye jo mohabbat he
 a few evergreen songs were filmed on Rajesh Khanna, especially sung by Kishore Kumar and R
 di
 Music by Burman
 phir bhi behtareen abhinay vaali unki filmon main se ek he ittefaq (nirdeshkah yash chopra, 1969), jisamen koi gaanaa nahin tha
 In it, he played the role of a fugitive suspected murderer
 unki pehali badi film thi aradhana (nirdeshkah shakti samant, 1969) jisamen unki dohari bhoomika thi or heroin thim sharmila tagore
 Roop Tera Mastana, one of the most intoxicating songs of Hindi cinema, was in this film, in which the lovers and girlfriends look at each other by bonding in attraction beyond the alcoholic atmosphere created by the combination of camera and song
 It was sure to be a 'mistake'
 isi film main khanna jab duusari bhoomika main lautate hai to sharmila tagore unki maa hoti hai
 The kind of vibe that arose between the two during this classic film had the effect that Sharmila went to work midway with her mentor Satyajit Ray, due to which the scenes of Sharmila in my dream queen song were later separated
 Was filmed with anand (nirdeshkah hrishikesh mukherjee, 1971) main khanna ne cancer ke marij kii bhoomika nibhaai
 The film's result is reflected in its great song and dialogue, "life should be big, not long
" '' yah film maut nahin, balki jivan kaa utsav he
 For the first time, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan came together
 baad main mukherjee ne hi namak haraam main donon ko 1973 main dobaaraa saath liya
 The story of Bangla writer Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay was based on Nishipadma's film Amar Prem (director: Shakti Samanta, 1972)
 inhen kii kahani par satyajit re ne pather panchali banaai thi
 Amar Prem's story is about a girl sold in a brothel, who later falls in love
 is film main chingaari koi bhadke geet kaaphi lokapriy hua
 Apart from this, Rajesh Khanna's dialogue, "pushpa, i Hate Tears" is one of the golden moments of film history which he himself starts crying after speaking
 apni tamaam behtareen bhoomikaaon main khanna kaa charitra romantic nayak tak simata hua nahin he balki unki filmein akasar beemaari, trade unionvaad, veshyavriti, pashu kalyaan aadi vishyon ko uthaate hue vyapak paariwarik rishton ke daayre main prem ko sthapit karti hai
 If he is remembered only as a romantic hero, it is probably because his work has not been properly critically appraised and on the upside it is assumed that Amitabh's rise had eclipsed him
 hindi filmon ke itihaas main un par filmaae gaye gane shaayad sabase romani hai, lekin unhen bhi rajesh khanna ke samgr kaam ke sandarbh main hi dekha janaa chahie
 i have passed by Rajesh Khanna's bungalow Ashirwad on Carter Road, Bandra several times
 vah kaaphi upekshit-sa tha
 i was forced to think about Khanna and stardom in Hindi films

 haal hi main maine stenford uniwarsity main ek parchaa padhaa tha, jisamen meri pasandida film hathi mere saathi (nirdeshkah em
 a
 thirumugam, 1971) ke bare main kai baaten thim
 The difference between humans and animals is questioned in the film and Rajesh Khanna is the only person who respects animals and understands their love, dedication
 film main raju or uske haathiyon par ganesh kii krupa dikhaai gai he, jisaki parinti yah hoti he ki inasaani krurta or avishvaas kaa shikaar hone ke baavjood ant main raju par parivaar kaa bharosa laut aata he
 Even today it inspires governments to protect endangered animals

 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party ke ghamaasan ko thaamne ke makasad se party supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha he ki unke jite ji yah party ek bani rahegi
 The essence of the latest developments of the party is hidden in this one sentence
 party adhyaksh darasal yah kah rahe hai ki unke rahete party kaa kaman unke haath main hi he or apane baad kaa bandobast wo bahut hi samajhadaari se karte ja rahe hai
 Mulayam has made it clear that Akhilesh is his successor, the future of the party, uninterrupted and free from any control or pressure
 yah pehla mauka tha jab akhilesh ne koi faisla itnaa kadaa liya ki jo parivaar or party ke ek sabase ahm vyakti se sambandhit tha
 Mulayam has maintained the dignity of his son's decision instead of turning him over
 ab akhilesh party main apane pita ke alaava kisi ke prati jabaavadeh nahin hai
 The earlier bet was played by the SP chief before the 2012 assembly elections
 unhone party ke yuva chehre ke taur par akhilesh yadav ko pradeshbhar main mayawati ke khilaaf yatra nikaalane or janamat taiyaar karne ke liye kaha
 Akhilesh carried this responsibility and the SP got a clear mandate in the elections
 is janadesh kii gaddi par savaar akhilesh kab apane pita kii peedi ke logon se aage nikal gaye, iskaa bahuton ko andaaza tak nahin lag sakaa
 Akhilesh's mandate of dissatisfaction with Bahujan Samaj Party was stated as a mandate
 akhilesh ke chaachaaon or maamaaon kii jamaat is faisle ke aage natmastak hone ke liye baadhya hui or akhilesh desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik soobe ke mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Mulayam's renunciation of the post of Chief Minister himself remained an example for the rest of the people and many seniors remained silent despite not wanting Akhilesh's decision to become Chief Minister
 yah mulaayam kaa pehla daanv tha
 Now come to another
 sankat yaa dramasmajawaadee party kaa tazaa raajnneetik sankatmulaayam singh yadavake isi raajnneetik drame kaa sikul he
 While running the government, the clan and other senior faces of the party should not revolt, it was necessary that they get the ministry according to their mind and the freedom to work in their own way
 mulaayam is tarah party ko bhi sadhate rahe or akhilesh ko bhi sambhavit khataron se bachaate rahe
 But now Kunba is demanding his share in the party standing on the threshold of elections
 sabko tikaton ke bantwaare main apana apana hissaa chahie
 There are also economic aspects of ticket distribution and political ambitions to increase the strength of our camp
 isse nipatna ek khaasaa kathin kaam he
 Secondly, the party and Mulayam Singh Yadav are well aware that the biggest disadvantage of a 10-headed state government in its own direction is that every person should have an entire clan instead of a strong and dominating Akhilesh as Chief Minister
 Let's see the rider on the chair
 isse akhilesh kii chhavi kamazor padi he
 To end this crisis and to give a clear message to the party for the future, Mulayam made the heroism of the party's strongest commander the raven of his strategy script
 shivpal ko mulaayam singh ne pradesh adhyaksh banaaya
 In this twinkle, Akhilesh snatched away his ministry
 party ko sabase nichle str tak pakadakar rakhane vaale shivpal aakhir main ek asahaay senapati banakar saamne aae jise akhilesh ke aage ghutane techne pade
 For the first time, Akhilesh is looking so strong and unshakable and that too against a very important and strong man who comes from his clan himself
 yah sandesh baaki party ke liye or soobe ke liye saaf he
 After this Ram Gopal has gone to the shelter of Akhilesh
 mulaayam singh ne samjhaute kaa formula nikaalte hue prajapati kii vaapasi kii ghoshnaa kar di he
