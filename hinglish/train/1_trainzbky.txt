 In many such cases, the question arises whether those who get married against the wishes of the family can get a share in their father's property? Please tell that Sakshi is married to Ajitesh Kumar under the Hindu Marriage Act 1956
 is act ke tahat shaadi karne waalon ko hindu saxeshan act (amendament) 2005 ke tahat apane pita kii sampatti par hissaa paane kaa puraa adhikaar he
 According to Upendra Mishra, Member and Advocate of the Executive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association, the Hindu Succession Act was amended in 2005 to make the daughter a shareholder of paternal property equal to the son
 matlab agar paitruk sampatti kaa bantwaaraa hoga, to beti ko bhi bete ke baraabar hissaa milegaa
 He says that if a father evicts his children from the property on marriage against the will, they can knock the court
 unhone bataaya ki hindu saxeshan act ke tahat sampatti ko do shrenee main baanta gaya he
 The first is the property which has been acquired by itself and the second is the property which the father has inherited from his ancestors i
e
 ancestral property
 edwocket upendra mishra kaa kahana he ki paitruk sampatti par to bete kii tarah beti kaa bhi puraa adhikaar banataa he
 The father has to give an equal share to both the daughter and the son in his paternal property
 unka kahana he ki sakshi ko wo sabhi adhikaar milenge, jo ek hindu ladki ko milte hai
 Also Assistant Professor of Law Department, Dr
 rajesh dube kaa bhi kahana he ki hindu saxeshan act (amendament) 2005 kii dhara 6 main beti ko bete ke baraabar mana gaya he yani paitruk sampatti par jo adhikaar betaa kaa he, wo adhikaar beti ko bhi he
 He says Sakshi will get full share on the ancestral property of her father Rajesh Mishra
 haalanki pita chahen to khud kii arjeet sampatti se apane bacchon ko bedakhal kar sakate hai, lekin paitruk sampatti se unka haq nahin chin sakate hai
 Let us tell you that Sakshi, daughter of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra from Bareilly, went against her family and married Ajitesh Kumar who comes from Dalit society

 Abu Salem, who came to India from Portugal with a nomination, suffered a major setback
 anderworld don abu salem ko mumbai kii vishesh tada adaalat ne do umrakaid kii sajaa sunai he
 Whereas according to the condition of extradition, he cannot be sentenced to more than 25 years
 salem ke karibiyon ne tada court ke is faisle ke khilaaf sarvocch nyaayalay main chunauti dene kii baat kahi he
 Judge of the special TADA court of Mumbai, GA Sanap, while delivering the sentence on Wednesday afternoon, said that Abu Salem was charged for plotting and executing the builder Pradeep Jain's murder and Section 3 (2) (1) of TADA and section 120 of Bhadvi
 B
 Under both sections, punishment for rigorous life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2-2 lakh is given
 jaj ne iske alaavaan 4 anya dhaaraon main 25-25 saal kii sajaa bhi sunai
 Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam has expressed happiness over the court verdict
 lekin ye bhi kaha ki salem ne jis tarah kaa aparaadh kiya he uske liye maut kii sajaa zyada uchit hoti
 But we do know that he was brought with conditions while extraditing from Portugal
 nyaaypalika ne apana kaam kar diya he, ab karypalika ke upar he ki wo maamle me kya rukh apanaati he? However, Sunil Jain, who has been struggling for 20 years to punish his elder brother's killer, is not satisfied with the life imprisonment
 unka kahana he ki hamaara puraa parivaar chahta he ki use maut kii sajaa mili kyonki agar ye aise hi chhot jayega to duusare gangster ko badhaava milegaa ki baahar baithkar kuch bhi kar lo hindustan main faansee kii sajaa nahin milegi
 Builder Pradeep Jain was murdered in March 1995 and Salem was brought to India on 11 November 2005
 tab tak do shootaron ko umr kaid kii sajaa ho chuki thi or kuch chhot chuke the
 Despite this, the investigating agency ATS, after questioning Salem, exposed four more accused Mehndi Hasan, VK Jham, Naeem Khan and Riyaz Siddiqui who were involved in the whole conspiracy
 tatkaaleen aties pramukh capi raghuvanshi ne enditivi se kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ki aties ke adhikariyon ne sajeesh kii har kadi ko jodakar ek majboot cese khadaa kiya tha
 But more important than that is the testimony of Pradeep Jain's family members and other eyewitnesses
 tada adaalat ne ek or doshi mehadi hasan ko bhi umrakaid kii sajaa sunai he jabaki wike jhaam kii umr or beemaari ko dekhte hue baaki kii sajaa maaf kar di
 Experts are telling that this is the first time that a big underworld don, who has been involved in committing crimes outside the country, has been proven guilty after being brought to India and has also been punished
 matlab saaf he desh ke baahar baithkar hindustan main aparaadh ko anjaam dene vaale duusare don or anderworld mafiaon ko liye ek sabak he ki wo is bhram main na rahe ki wo kanoon se upar he

 lekin talaak dene par bhi teen saal kii jail ho rahi he kya ye sahi he
 There is no provision in the bill on how the woman will be given money, how much will be given and what will be her process

 For that it is necessary to send it to the Standing Committee
 unhone kaha ki talaak dene ke baad jab pati jail chalaa jayega, or use bel bhi nahin milegi
 So how will he agree to give allowance to his wife
 agar court main pati kahe ki meraa talaak dene kaa makasad nahin tha, main bas gusse main tha

 Sometimes we think that we are right, but not every time
 bill main jo kamiyaan hai, wo saath main baithkar dur kii ja sakati hai
 We can send it to the Standing Committee, where all the parties can meet and debate on it
 is mudde par jo sarkaar kaa mat he, vaisaa hi mat vipaksh kaa bhi he
 We do not want to avoid it, but common consent is necessary
 isliye ise standing cameti main is bill ko bhej diya jaae
 03:17 PM: Ravi Shankarbole said that we have made a very small bill, if you say you will go to jail
 aapako patni ke liye guzaara bhatta dena hi hoga

 First Speaker After the formation of the first Lok Sabha from the Congress in 1952, Congress leader and freedom fighter Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar became the first speaker of the country and his election was uncontested
 1956 main maavlankar ke nidhan ke baad shesh kaarykaal ke liye unke sthaan par congress ke hi ananthavyanam ayangaar kaa chunaav bhi nirvirodh hua
 His tenure was ordinary, but he will always be remembered as the first speaker of the country
 ek spikar jo raashtrapati bana1967 main neelam sanjeev reddy desh ke chauthe loksabhaa spikar bane
 As a speaker, he resigned from the Congress party and retired from active politics
 vah khud ko sansad kaa prahari (wochaman of parliament) kehete the, lekin bataur spikar unka kaarykaal saamaanya nahin rahaa
 He had a heated debate with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on several occasions in the House
 neelam sanjeev reddy ko iskaa khamiyaja 1969 main raashtrapati chunaav main bhugatna padaa jab chunaav ladane ke liye unhone spikar pad chhod diya tha
 Indira Gandhi, who saw the results during the general elections in 1967, declared Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as the presidential candidate, but Indira Gandhi opposed him
 indira gandhi ko lagata tha ki agar reddy chunaav jeet jate hai to unhen pradhanmantri pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 Although he was forced to accept Reddy as a candidate due to heavy party pressure, he appealed to his party's elected representatives to listen to their conscience instead of going to the party line
 parinaam yah hua ki neelam sanjeev reddy chunaav haar gaye or nirdaleey ummidavaar vivi giri raashtrapati ban gaye
 This was the initial phase from where Indira Gandhi's position continued to strengthen and she went above the party

 The Congress chose PA Sangma, a tribal leader from the Northeast and a prominent speaker, as the speaker
 vah is pad par mahaj do saal (1 saal 304 din) hi rah sake kyonki loksabhaa samay se pehle hi bhang ho gai
 His tenure as a speaker was highly commendable as there was no accusation of him from any side in power and opposition
 aise daur main jab loksabhaa trishanku thi to unhone sadan main sabhi netaaon ko ekajute kiye rakhaa or vah sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaate rahe

 Karthik said that the decision was taken when the team realized that people's feelings were hurt by watching the film trailer
 is film ke trailor main karthik aryan kaa kirdaar chintu tyaagi apane dost (aparshakti khurana) ko shikaayat kar rahaa he ki kaise uski jindagi main sex kii kami he
 In this objection trailer, Chintu says, "if you ask for sex from your wife, we beggars
" bivi ko sex karne se manaa kar den, to ham atyaachaari
 And somehow managed to get sex from him, neither we rapists
 'ye dialog janata ko raas nahin aayaa or twitor par is dialog ko lekar logon ne khub naaraazgi bhi jataai
 People said that marital rape is not a joke
 iske saath hi film se is dialog ko hataane kii maang kii gai thi
 Karthik asked for forgiveness
 When Karthik Aryan was asked about this controversy during an interview, he said, "when the trailer of the film came, we understood that we should not hurt the feelings of the people and we should send this dialogue as soon as possible Should be removed
 zyaadaatar filmon main aisa nahin hota he
 'view this post on Instagram It was like coming in front of people as if our thinking is flawed
 hamen samaj aayaa ki hamen rape jaise shabd kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie tha or isliye hamane ise hataa diya or isamen kuch badlaav kare taaki kisi ko thes naa pahunche
 Karthik told that it was only after people raised their voices that the attention of the team of the film went to that side, otherwise no one thought about it
 unhone kaha, 'hamen is baat kaa ehsaas hi nahin hua tha ki ham aisa kuch kar rahe hai
 We had shown this trailer to many people, but no one said anything about this dialogue
 ham kisi kii bhaavana ko thes nahin pahunchaana chaahate the
 This is not the topic of our film nor is it our thought
 'bhoomi ne bhi maangi thi maafeebataa den ki kuch samay pehle pati patni or wo kii actress bhoomi pednekar ne bhi is dialog ko lekar maafee maangi thi
 Like Kartik, he also said not to hurt people's feelings
 film pati patni or wo kii baat karen to isamen karthik or bhoomi ke saath actress ananyaa pandey he
 This is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, made by director Mudassar Aziz, about married life and affair
 sonia mahrauli se or unki bahan vandana dwarka se puraani dilli railway stesan ke paas mithai pul par lagane vaale bazaar main daal kii talash kar rahi thim
 Sonia brought her young son with her
 tej garmi or bazaar kii thakaa dene vaali bheed main kisi tarah jagah banaakar donon bahanen sasti daal talash rahi thim
 Pulses were cheap everywhere in this market, but the search was on whose pulses were the least bad
 ravivaar ko is bazaar main ghoomte- ghoomte main sonia or vandana se takaraa gaya
 i went to this Raviwari market on the Yellow Kothi Sweets Bridge to see why mango or poor man is forced to buy things that the rich or middle class do not consider fit to eat
 sonia ne sasti daal ke liye mahrauli se puraani dilli stesan ke bich saadhe baees kilometre kii duuri tay kii he or vandana ne dwarka se mahrauli hote hue puraani dilli ke bich 33
 4 kilometers
 isi tarah ghaziabad se aage dadri se aae ek sajjan se mulaakaat hui jo local train pakadakar sasti daal kharidne aae the
 They had covered a distance of about 56 km to buy the lowest quality pulses at Rs 40 per kg
 dadri se puraani dilli tak aane main local train se inhen ek ghanta lag gaya tha
 In the same way i met a woman who had come from the Loni area bordering UP to get pulses
 loni or mithai pul ke bich kii duuri 20 kimi he
 It would have taken at least two and a half hours to get there by bus
 nangaloi se ek janaab 17 kimi or gudgaanv se do mitra 38 kimi kii duuri tay kar daal kharidne aae the
 Can you imagine that in this Delhi people are spending the whole day for pulses on Sunday
 sari duuri maine google se nikaali he lekin in ilaakon se aae logon se mulaakaat kii kahani bilkul sachhee he
 After traveling for two to four hours, take a bit of the quality of the pulses for which these people are coming to the Raviwari market on the sweet bridge
 is bazaar main godaamon main jameen par bikhare chaaval or daal ko dhul kankad ke saath samet kar bechaa jaataa he
 By mixing different types of pulses, a new variety of mixed lentils was found, which people were not able to buy even at the rate of forty rupees per kg
 godaamon main jab chuuhe anaaj kii bori kaat dete hai or anaaj thodaa kharaab ho jaataa he to vah mithai pul ke bazaar ke kharidaaron ke liye bech diya jaataa he
 One woman said that their lentils are for both man and animal
 jo jis kaam ke liye kharid le or kha le
 By buying the same pulses, man is also eating what is meant for animals
 dilli kii haisiyat hindustan main sabase adhik prati vyakti aay vaale shahar ke rup main he
 The condition of the citizens of that Delhi is that they are eating broken pulses, rotten and slightly less spoiled pulses
 har maal yahaan kharaab nahin he lekin har maal acha yaa sabase acha bhi nahin he
 There was no shortage of crowds
 tarah-tarah ke pahanaavon or boli bolne vaale log yahaan is bharose ke saath kharidari kar rahe the ki koi dekh na le
 No one can know that they come here and buy dal rice
 logon ne bataaya ki kuch log subah-subah jaldi aa jate hai taaki bheed kii nigaah se batch jaaen
 Hotel people also come and take people from here and feed them
 kuch log zyada mukhar or eemaandaar nikle
 i was surrounded by a crowd of speakers
 ek ne kaha ki teen saal se saat hajaar kii tankhwaah main ek rupee kii badhottaree nahin hui he
 If there is no market for the sweet bridge, then we cannot run the house
 dhul kankad vaale chaaval-daal kharid kar le jate hai
 This is done by sorting it out
 matlab samay inke liye samasya nahin he
 The problem is price and purchasing power, which they do not have
 kisi ne kaha ki ve pehle saath rupee vaali daal khate the lekin kuch hafton se chalis rupee vaali daal khaane lage hai
 The comments daal ko lekar itani baaten hone lageen ki thodi der ke liye main puri dilli ko daal kii nazar se dekhne laga
 i started getting confused that all the people who came there are shouting Dal-dal, delhi-delhi
 dhai sau gram sasti daal ke liye logon kaa hujum dilli- dilli bhatak rahaa he
 Lentils become expensive
 is bazaar main bhi daal mahangi hui he
 a shopkeeper said that our forty rupee goods were now sixty and sixty eighty
 nateeja yah he ki sahab log ek kilo kii jagah dhai sau gram daal kharid rahe hai
 Our sales have also come down
 aap jaanate hai ki daal kii keemat 140 se 160 rupee ke bich pahunch gai he
 There can be neither food nor hymns without lentils and bread
 lekin is daal ko hasil karne ke liye logon ko kitni daal galani pad rahi he
 Both sweat and money are being shed
 ek mahila ne kaha ki uske ghar main ab hafte main ek din daal banati he
 The rest of the days work in the evening with juicy vegetables
 chaaval bhi mahangaa ho gaya he
 How long will we eat pebble rice
 hamaari koi nahin sunata
 No one is watching what the poor are eating
 shaayad vah sahi he
 We are not ready to believe that there will be this level of poverty in the Delhi metropolis

 Amid military escalation with India in Doklam, Sikkim region, China is playing a psychological game to build pressure
 iske liye china sainya abhyaas ke puraane video jari kar rahaa he, to media ke jariye bhi game plan kar rahaa he
 However, the situation is that there has not been much increase in the deployment of troops near the indo-china border and its recent military exercise in the Tibet region should not be linked to the current deadlock in the Doklam region between the armies of the two countries
 padhie bharat par dabaav banane ke liye china ke 5 jhooth -1
 Highly placed sources in the Government of China practice in Tibet said that the exercise was part of regular exercises on behalf of China and that its Western Theater Command has not made such a large increase in army deployment in view of the deadlock that India feels threatened 
 yah kaman bharat ke saath lagati 3488 kilometre seemaa kii raksha karata he
 The case of military exercises carried out by China in Tibet is two months old and was done in June
 bharat par manovaigyanik dabaav banane ke liye china ne ab video jari kiya he

 hajaaron ton sajo saamaan tibet bhejachin kii sena ke aadhikarik mukhpatr main chhapi khabar ke pariprekshya main sarkaar ke sutron kaa yah bayaan aayaa he
 The mouthpiece showed that after the standoff with Indian troops at Doklam in Sikkim sector, the Chinese army has sent thousands of tons of military equipment to the remote mountainous region of Tibet
 report main kaha gaya he ki sajo saamaan pichley maheene bheja gaya tha lekin spasht nahin kiya ki sainya sajo saamaan tibet main abhyaas ke liye le jaaya gaya tha yaa kisi or kaaran se

 sainya abhyaas ko badha chadhaakar pesh karnaais ilaake main bharat kii sena dwaara china kii sena ko sadak banane se rokane ke baad ek maheene se zyada samay se yahaan gatirodh bana hua he
 Sources in the government recently described the practice of China's military in the mountainous areas of Tibet as a regular exercise and said that it was an exaggerated report to relate it to tension on the border
 china kii sena ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki isane pathaar main apni maarak kshamta ko parakhane ke liye abhyaas kiya tha
 The agencies monitoring the situation say that there have been no unusual activities of China in the last two months on the Line of Actual Control (line of Actual Control)
 iskaa matlab ye he ki china media ke jariye bharat par dabaav banane kaa manovaigyanik game khel rahaa he
 4
 3488 kimi lambii seemaa par 50 hajaar sainikbhaarat china seemaa par dragon ne 15-16 divijan ko tainaat kiya he
 This means about 50 thousand soldiers are deployed on the 3488 km long border
 haalanki china aisa pehle bhi kar chukaa he
 China has 5 operational air fields in Tibet, but cannot start another 4-5 landing strip, because they lack operational capacity
 shinjiyang main jo ki uttari jammu kashmir kaa vipareet ilaaka he, china 4-5 divijan kii tainaati kii he
 China's western command cannot do much as our 12-13 divisions are deployed along the Line of Actual Control
 sthiti itani kharaab nahin he, jaisaa ki china dikhaanaa chaah rahaa he
 This is only to put pressure on India
 5
 India is 9 times stronger than China in Doklam
 If war situation prevails in Doklam area, then China will have to pay it expensive
 yahaan bharat ke ek sainik ke mukaable china ko 9 sainik khadey karne honge
 India's position in Doklam is very strong
 jahaan tak javaanon kii sankhya kii baat he, to bharat ke paas is ilaake main china se zyada sainik hai
 Since 2009, China has been conducting military exercises in Tibet continuously, so as to enhance the infrastructure
 iske saath hi bharat sanpo ilaake main bhi sthiti par najar rakhe hue hai
 The Sangpo area falls opposite Mount Kailash in Arunachal Pradesh, which is adjacent to the Brahmaputra River
 china ne yahaan 11 pul bana rakhe hai
 Security conditions are a cause of concern for India on the 250-km-long border here
 haalanki is ilaake main china ne kisi tarah kii koi harakat nahin kii he

 He does not want to split the vote against badal-amarinder by forming a party
 siddhu ne kaha ki siyaasi manch 'aawaaj-e-punjab' abhi bhi jari rahegaa
 He said that the political platform started with Pargat Singh, the Bains brothers of Ludhiana, will remain till the elections in Punjab
 siddhu ke kareebi logon kii maane to sitambar ke baad vah 'kapil sharma sho' main nahin dikhenge
 Sidhu earns Rs 25 crore annually from this show

 Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur recently told that her husband has already made it clear that there is nothing for him more than the responsibility of Punjab
 isse saaf mana ja rahaa he ki ab vah jald hi kapil sharma sho ko bhi aakhri salaam karne vaale hai
 It is worth mentioning that whether Navjot Singh Sidhu left the BJP or not was not clear for several days
 lekin 14 sitambar ko is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki do maheene se siddhu ke agali raajnneetik party ko chunane kii kavayad chal rahi thi lekin is bich unhone bijepi chodi nahin thi
 That is, at the time of resigning from Rajya Sabha in July, neither during talks with Arvind Kejriwal nor at the time of announcement of 'awaaz e Punjab', Sidhu resigned from BJP

 The comments aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ab nae manch main siddhu mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar honge or unhone 'ek jaise vichaaron' ke logon ko party main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya he
 By the way, Sidhu has not only responded to AAP but also Congress chief Amarinder Singh in Punjab
 isse pehle july maheene main navjot singh siddhu ne rajyasabha kii sadsyta se istipha diya
 He was associated with BJP for the last 12 years
 unki shikaayat thi ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ne unhen amritsar se chunaav ladane nahin diya jabaki das saal tak unka is seat par kabza rahaa
 Explain that in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party had fielded Arun Jaitley in place of Sidhu
 jo amarinder singh se haar gaye the
 Local BJP leaders accused Sidhu of tampering with Jaitley's votes
 siddhu ne kaha ki party khadi karne ke liye 2-3 saal kaa samay lagata he

 yani july main rajyasabha se istipha dene ke vakt, arvind kejariwal se baatcheet ke dauraan or na hi 'awaz e punjab' kii ghoshnaa ke samay siddhu ne bijepi se istipha diya
 Sidhu cited the biggest reason for bjp's displeasure that the party told him to stay away from Punjab
 jo unke liye sambhav nahin tha
 Let me tell you that two weeks ago, 52-year-old Sidhu announced the new party, saying that it was not possible to join hands with AAP
 unhone dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par aarope lagaaya ki vah party main aise log chaahate hai jo unki 'haa main haa' milaae
 At the same time, Sidhu also said that Kejriwal had told him that he should not participate in next year's Punjab elections
 tippaniyan It is believed that Sidhu will now be the chief ministerial candidate in the new forum and has invited people of 'similar views' to join the party
 vaise siddhu ne sirf aap ko hi nahin punjab main congress ke pramukh amarinder singh ko bhi na main hi jawaab diya he
 Earlier in July, Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership
 vah pichley 12 saal se bijepi ke saath jude hue the
 His complaint was that the party did not let him contest from Amritsar in the 2014 assembly elections, while he held this seat for ten years

 The stir has intensified in the Delhi Pradesh Congress these days over Sheila Dixit, who ruled the throne of Delhi for 15 years

 haalanki vidhayakon kii is maang par dilli congress ke aalaa netaa zyada kuch bolne se batch rahe hai

 Sheila Dixit was the face of the Congress in Delhi for fifteen years, but she also bore the brunt of the crushing defeat in the assembly elections
 ab ye dekhnaa dilachalp hoga ki party is babat kya nirnay leti he

 Expressing satisfaction over the steps taken by the Center and the Delhi government to deal with swine flu, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said that no such case has come up in the court, in which the administration has been said to have failed
 mukhya nyaayadhish ji
 Rohini and Judge R
 es
 The Endlaw bench, while passing an order on a PIL seeking immediate steps to deal with swine flu, said, "the first steps taken by Delhi and the central government in this matter and the steps currently being taken, We are satisfied with that
 " On the issue of spreading awareness among people about swine flu, the court said, "as far as suggestions regarding public awareness are concerned, from our own experience of living in Delhi, we have realized that there is no shortage
 
 " He said, "the subject has been discussed at various levels in society
 pehle hi is beemaari ko lekar kaaphi bhay fail chukaa he
 " janhit yachika main maang kii gai thi ki sarkaar rashtriya rajdhani main saste dar par swine flu kii jaanch ke liye adhik prayogshaalaon kii sthapana kare
 The court said that it cannot give directions on reducing the cost of the investigation as appropriate authority has been constituted in this regard, who have taken note of the issue
 peeth ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar dwaara saunpe gaye halafname se yah spasht hota he ki is beemaari kii rokthaam tathaa shodh kii disha main kaam pehle se hi jari he
 The court said, "the court cannot bear the burden of running the city
 prashasan kii naakaami kaa koi maamla saamne nahin aayaa he, jisapar koi karrwai kii jaae
 " isse pehle, centre sarkaar ne nyaayalay se kaha tha ki swine flu par vah rajya sarkaar kii madad kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on a tour of Japan after announcing demonetisation in the country on 8 November
 khasbaat he ki kendra sarkaar ne desh main notebandi kaa elaan kar bharat ko digital iconomi banane kii kavayad kii
 But soon after this announcement, PM Modi arrived on a visit to Japan from the cash economy which was there and that too in the top gear
 japan kii zyaadaatar dukaane aaj bhi credit card or debit card ke madhyam se paise nahin leti
 Because of which people carry a lot of cash in their pockets
 iske chalate na to japan kii arthvyavastha main koi dikkat hoti he or na hi kharidari karne main kisi ko footkar kii samasya jhelni padati he
 Although new cashless means of transactions (credit and debit cards, Apple Pay) have made a place in Japan over the past few years, cash transactions have doubled over the past 20 years
 japan ke kendriya bank ke aankade kehete hai ki oktober 2016 tak japan kii arthvyavastha main 101 trillian yen cash main maujuud tha
 At the same time, cash accounted for 80% of the total transactions in Japan as of 2014
 card bhi he lekin cash ij kingis cash vyavastha main aisa nahin he ki plastic mani yaa cashles card maujuud nahin he
 Japan first used a credit card in 1960 when the Maruti department store issued the card to customers for purchase
 aaj japan main lagbhag 32 karod aise credit card maujuud hai, yani prati vyask teen credit card
 Also read: Demonetisation is a foolish decision, minus 10 out of 10: Chidambaram According to the International Plastic Money Company mastercard, more than 38 percent of transactions in Japan are still in cash
 yah france main cash tranjaction kaa paanch guna he
 At the same time, cash transactions are 20 percent in the US and only 11 percent in England
 aakhir kyon japan main 'cash ij king'cash ke prachlan ke peeche sabase bada tark diya jaataa he ki yah sabase surakshit madhyam he
 Theft, snatching and robbery in Japan is almost non-existent
 log yahaan apni jeb yaa bag main dheron cash lekar chalane main darate nahin hai
 Alam is that if your purse filled with money falls somewhere, just wait, someone will send it to your address soon and in case there is no address or ID in the purse, it will be found at the nearest police station
 ise bhi padhein: congress kaa waar- notebandi main choti machhliyaan fansi, magaramchh nikalne main hue kaamyabchhote dukandaaron kii majaburi he cashcash kaa doosraa mahatv deshbhar main maujuud chote kiraanaa store or khaane-pine kii dukaanon ke kaaran he
 These small and medium shopkeepers are unable to prepare the terms of fees on transactions through credit and debit cards issued by banks, so they completely discard these mediums
 iske alaava aise dukandaaron ko doosraa bada phayda inakam tex main bachat ke rup main miltaa he kyonki aamtaur par vah prati varsh kaarobaar main ghate kaa ritern bharte hai
 But their number is so large that the government shies away from imposing income tax
 atm technology main sabase aage japantechnology ke maamle main japan duniya kaa agrani desh he
 The threat of technology can be clearly seen in all the big cities of Japan
 isi kaa nateeja he ki japan kii rajdhani samet desh ke bade shaharon main maujuud bainkon kii atm mashine cash dene ke saath-saath note or sikkon kaa aadan pradaan bhi karte hai
 If you want to pay money to a shopkeeper, it is natural that he will expect cash, and all you have is a debit or credit card
 to pareshaani kii baat nahin he kyonki aap apane card se kisi atm se note or sikke nikaal sakate hai
 If you have the money only in the note, you can get the coins for free from the ATM
 iske alaava sikkon ke evaj main zyaadaatar atm mashin aapako note bhi pradaan kar degi or yah sabhi vyavastha muft he kyonki japan main cash ij king
 Now you can tell me that when Japan can run its hundreds of years old economy without changing, then did Prime Minister Modi not have to learn this skill on his immediate visit to Japan after the decision of demonetisation
 japan ke shaharon kii tarah bharat ke shahar bhi america or europe ho chuke hai
 However, as soon as the real Japan starts out of the cities, the real India starts in the villages outside the cities of India
 modi ji kya vaaki jaruri tha ki hajaaron saal puraani gaanvon kii note or sikkon vaali vishwaas kii arthvyavastha ko khatm kar credit or debit vaali udhaar kii vyavastha ko lagu karnaa?

 Director Anand Kumar was heavily inspired by films like 'dabangg' 'singham' and 'omkara', when the introduction scenes, songs and choreography of the stars resembled these films
 film main item song jabardastee daale hue nazar aate hai
 The film seems a bit cautious after interval, but by then the game is over
 tippaniyan Now acted
 arshad varsi kaa abhinay qaabil−e taareef he
 Sanjay Dutt also looked good in some scenes, but it seems that the director got him done, which is probably not his case
 masalan unka tital song par naachna yaa kuch aise ection seens, jinhen sahi dhang se anjaam tak nahin pahunchaaya gaya
 Ravi Kishan's performance was good

 According to reports, the film is based on some true events that took place in Ghaziabad in the 90s, but when it was given the film form, it emerged as a Bollywood film of the 80s and 90s
 nirdeshak anand kumaar 'dabang' 'singhm' or 'omkara' jaisi filmon se kaafii prerit dikhe, tabhi to stars kaa introdection seen, gane or koreographi in filmon se milti-julati nazar ai
 In the film, the item song appears to be forced
 film interval ke baad thodi sanbhalti nazar aati he, lekin tab tak khel khatm ho chukaa hota he
 The comments ab baat abhinay kii
 Arshad Warsi's performance is worthy
 sanjay dutt bhi kuch seens main achche dikhe, par lagata he diarector ne unase wo karvaa diya, jo shaayad unke bas kii baat nahin
 For example, they danced to the title song or some action scenes that were not delivered properly
 ravi kishan kii adaakaari acchhee rahi
 Actors like Ashutosh Rana were not used properly in the film
 kai seens main bajet kii kami nazar ai
 For example, the film's effects and music were seen making noise
 kul milakar yah ek saadhaaran film he, isliye film ko hamaari ore se 2 star

 Manjhi had also said that he would not take less than 13 seats under any circumstances

 pichley dinon ek channel ke kaarykram main bhaag lete hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha tha ki maanjhi rajya str netaa hai, jabaki apane bare main unhone kaha ki wo rashtriya str ke dalit netaa hai
 The comments yahi nahin paswan ne maanjhi par vyangy karte hue kaha ki wo rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan main nae-nae aae hai or unhen abhi sabit karnaa baaki he ki wo apni jati maanjhi kaa vot trsanfer kara pate hai ki nahin
 Responding to this, Manjhi said that he is worried about his family and not the Dalits and should not make the mistake of considering them as ants, because ants can also defeat elephants
 maanjhi ne paswan se poocha ki aakhir unki party main har pad par unke bete, bhai yaa damaad hi kyon asin hai
 Certainly Paswan was not aware of this attack by Manjhi and when asked his response on Monday, he deferred questions
 beete somvaar ko hi takaraar kaa taaja udhaaharan us samay dekhne ko mila, jab purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne tikhe shabdon main kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan par hamalaa bolaa
 Manjhi attacked Paswan for the first time in response to questions from reporters in his constituency Makhdumpur
 darasal, maanjhi har maukey par paswan dwaara unhen nicha dikhaae jane par na keval pareshaan the, balki unhone man bana liya ki ab paswan se saarvajanik rup se do-do haath kar hisaab baraabar karenge
 Recently, while participating in a program of a channel, Ram Vilas Paswan had said that Manjhi is a state level leader, while he said about himself that he is a national level Dalit leader
 tippaniyan Not only this, Paswan sarcastically said that he has come new to the National Democratic Alliance and he has yet to prove whether he can transfer his caste Manjhi's vote
 isi ke jawaab main maanjhi ne apni bhadaas nikaalte hue kaha ki paswan ko keval apane parivaar kii chintaa rahati he na ki daliton kii or wo unhen cheentee samajhane kii galati na karen kyonki cheentee bhi hathi ko parrast kar sakati he
 Manjhi asked Paswan why his son, brother or son-in-law is in every position in his party
 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya
 In fact, Manjhi was not only upset about Paswan being let down by him at every opportunity, but he made up his mind that now he would be able to settle the accounts publicly with Paswan

 At present, the Kamal Nath government has no plan to give unemployment allowance
 isaki jaankaree khud mukhyamantri kamalnath ne mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main congress vidhayak munnalaal goyal ke prashn kaa uttar dete hue di
 In fact, in the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh last year, the Congress promised in its affidavit (manifesto) an unemployment allowance of up to four thousand rupees to the youth of the state, but in the Legislative Assembly, when MLA Munnalal Goyal asked the question of employment to the registered unemployed
 Is the government making any policy to provide or give unemployment allowance to them? Its CM Kamal Nath replied in writing 'no'
 isse pehle berogari bhatta ko lekar netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ne yuvaaon ke saath chhalaava kiya
 Prior to the election, unemployment allowance was pledged to the unemployed youth of 4 thousand per month, but no clear mention was made in the budget regarding unemployment allowance
 sirf baton main ghumaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Gopal Bhargava had said that the Kamal Nath government needs to do concrete work instead of branding Mawa Bati, Jalebi and Chironji Barfi
 sarkaar ne chunaav ke pehle janata ko jo vachan die the, unhen pure karne kii is bajet main koi manshaa nahi dikhaai detii he
 Significantly, the Kamal Nath government had announced the Yuva Swabhimaan Yojana
 is yojana ke tahat berozegaar yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene or unhen aarthik rup se majboot banaaya janaa tha
 The Madhya Pradesh cabinet had approved the implementation of the scheme
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne shahari kamjor tabake ke yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya tha
 Under the scheme, the youth were to get 100 days of training and employment in a year
 is avadhi main in yuvaaon ko kul milakar 13 hajaar rupye yani 4000 rupye maheene ke hisaab se maandey bhi diya janaa tha
 With which Kamal Nath government has retracted

 4 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todekptain rishikesh kanitkar ne aath maichon main 506 ran banaae or is tarah apana udhaaharan rakhte hue netritv kiya
 It is praiseworthy that he could win his team twice in a row in the final of Ranji
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todavinith saxena ne das maichon main 897 ran banaae, jinamein tamilnadu ke khilaaf final main banaaya gaya doharaa shatak shaamil he
 In the final matches, he set a record by batting on all five days

 Ashok Menaria showed his superiority by scoring 462 runs in just five matches
 unhen sambhavnapurna ballebaaj mana ja rahaa he, jinhen beemaari ke kaaran ranjai team se baahar hona padaa tha
 Deepak Chahar, considered to be the find of last year, was able to take only six wickets in four matches
 toornament kii khoj ke taur par ubhare ruturaj singh, jinhone maatr 4 maichon main 26 wicket liye
 Similarly, Robin Bisht scored 1,034 runs in just 10 matches
 ummid he ki ranjai main apane pradarshan ke aadhaar par rashtriya team ke liye un par vichaar ho saktaa he
 This team, which is the winner of all the performances at the right time, is completed by Sumit Mathur (25 wickets in 8 matches), Vivek Yadav (17 wickets in 5 matches) and Dishant Yagnik (19 wickets in 6 matches)
 thodaa-sa shrey vastav main lalit modi ko bhi diya janaa chahie, jinhone jaipur ke savai maansingh stadium main tamaam suvidhaayen laakar ise cricket kaa ek shandaar prashikshan maidan bana diya he
 Since then, the Rajasthan Cricket Association has seen only fights among various factions, in which friendship turns into enmity

 Association President c

 dikshit or rajasthan state sports council ke adhyaksh shivacharan mali puraane saathi the, lekin baad main ek duusare ke virdohi ho gaye
 The poor performance of the team in the opening matches was also due to frequent fights in the association
 asava jor dekar kehete hai ki association or team prabandhan ne is tarah kii samasyaon se team ke chayan yaa pradarshan ko prabhavit nahin hone diya he
 "he did not interfere and he remained a professional," he says
 ''lekin hakeekat yah he ki team joshi, dikshit or mali ke baavjood jiti he, unke kaaran nahin jiti he
 The story of the victory, the coach's last year when we won the Ranji Trophy, it was a "fairytale victory
" '' qaraar diya gaya tha
 Was not wrong
 gharelu cricket main aisa karnama pehali baar hua tha ki jis team ko phiseddi (plate) tiimon ke group main sabase neeche rakhaa gaya ho, vah nami tiimon ko bhi haraate hue trophy jeet le
 We have proved that absurd by repeating the same performance this year
 yah sab 'sari kathinaaiyon ke baavjood' hua
 We were placed in a tough group of elite teams
 hamaara muqabla un majboot tiimon ke saath tha, jinka jeet kaa itihaas rahaa he
 The journey was difficult and despite making a good score, we failed to take the lead in the first innings in the first five matches
 gendbaaji baith nahin rahi thi
 In every match, we had no bowler in form
 khilaadiyon se kai duusari galtiyaan bhi huin
 We had just five points after the fifth match
 kwalifoi kar sakane kii ummid dhoomil ho chuki thi
 Discussions had begun whether we would be able to stay in the elite group or not
 tabhi karishma hua
 In the sixth match, we directly defeated the powerful team of Saurashtra and scored a decisive five points
 form main chal rahe madhyam gati ke tej gendbaaj, madhyakram ke ballebaaj or vikvtakiper-ballebaaj ko shaamil karke hamen sahi team combination bhi mil gaya
 We did not let the losses in the opening matches dominate the minds and hearts
 orissa se match main qualiphi karne kii ummiido ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye chah ank lenaa jaruri tha
 After the victory over Saurashtra, the team full of positive energy once again played a brilliant cricketer and scored
 ab ham log qualiphi karke ek lay main aa chuke the
 We beat Hyderabad and Haryana on their home grounds
 yah aasaan nahin tha or in donon maichon main najuk maukey aae the, jinase ham apane khilaadiyon ke kathin halaat main shandaar mehnat or jimmedaari ke pradarshan ke boote paar paa gaye
 Our strategy was to make a simple plan according to the circumstances and implement it best
 final main tamilnadu gharelu maidan par khel rahaa tha or jahiraa taur par vahi pasandida team thi
 In fact, it was interesting to us too and we were happy to be hidden
 haalanki tamilnadu ne puure toornament ke dauraan ek samaan krickwt khelaa, lekin hamaari teen sidhi jeeton ke mukaable unhen kul ek jeet hasil hui
 So, after winning the toss, we knew that if we could score enough runs, we had bowling that could take the pressure off their strong batting line-up
 hamaari ranneeti kaam ai or hamane paristhitiyon ke saath acchhee tarah talmail baithaate hue puri dridhtaa ke saath ballebaaji kii or 621 ranon kaa ek vishaal score khadaa kar diya
 Overall, the reasons for our success were extensive preparation focused on superiority, excellent team combination and solidarity
 khilaadiyon or sahaayak staff kaa sakaaratmak mindset
 It gave us an edge over all the other teams

 lekin argedy netaa chhaapon ke baad lalu kii line par hi bayaan de rahe hai
 Party leader Manoj Jha said that Modi's new alliance is actually with the CBI and the Income Tax Department and the Grand Alliance is unbreakable
 purv kendriya mantri or lalu ke kareebi raghuvansh prasad singh ne bhi doharaaya ki lalu ke bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya he or modi sarkaar apni naakaamiyaan chhipaane ke liye lalu ko nishaanaa bana rahi hai
 On the same lines, RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari also accused the BJP of creating hurdles against regional parties
 duusari ore, congress pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne bhi lalu ke saath gathjod ko atoot bataaya or is maamle main sabhi kayaason ko khaarij kiya

 Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was sharper than him
 unhone kaha ki puraa desh jaanata he jaanwaron kaa chaara kisne khaaya
 He reminded CM Nitish Kumar of the law made by his government which has the provision of confiscating the property of corrupt officials
 unhone lalu par bhi isi kanoon ko lagu karne kii maang kii
 Prasad said that Nitish Kumar did not have the courage to remove Lalu's sons from the cabinet

 Yogendra Yadav, who is very calm by nature, serious, and speaking in the Hindi language with a strange artificial purity, has never seen anyone getting angry
 lekin apane twitor acount ke profile main khud ko ‘‘political animal’’ kehane vaale yogendra kaa raajnneeti ke prati shuru se rujhaan rahaa he
 So when Arvind Kejriwal drove the road of mass movement against corruption of Anna Hazare, Yogendra immediately jumped on him
 ve maanate hai, ‘‘jab yah andolan rajnatik dal main parinat ho gaya to meraa isse baahar rahane kaa koi kaaran nahin tha
 "I also told the platform of Ramlila Maidan during Anna's movement that the logical end of anti-corruption would come only in politics," says Yogendra
 ’’ anna ke manch par yogendra kii badi sakriyata arvind kii usee ranneeti kaa hissaa thi, jise unhone aam aadmi party ke rup main badal diya
 Soon he started writing other documents from aap's constitution
 arvind kii team main apane badhate prabhaav or anna kii vidaai par ve kehete hai, ‘‘andolan kii mukhyadhara kii aawaaj jis vyakti se milti ho, us par sabaki nigaah jaati he
 i have been saying the same thing for a year, but since my voice was marginalized then nobody listened
 ’’to kya tivi channelon par apane khaas andaaj main chunaavon kaa rajnatik vishleshan karne vaala shaks achaanak raajnneeti kii pich par khud batting karne laga? raajnneeti se yogendra kaa judaav 1980 ke dashak se rahaa he
 When he reached Delhi to study MA in Political Science at Jawaharlal Nehru University, there were student organizations like SFI, ABVP, NSUI, which have become the face of political parties
 lekin kuch saathiyon ke saath milakar unhone sirf chaatro ke liye kaam karne vaale student democratic soshal front naam se ek alag chaatr ikai gathit karne main apni bhoomika nibhaai
 The organization also won the student union election in 1982

 He was promising and connected with society from the beginning and now both these things have become solid
 ’’ yogendra ko eme main bhanbhari ne bi plus grad diya tha, jabaki baaki main unhen e plus mila tha
 According to Bhambhari, Yogendra himself said in a seminar, "bhambhari Sahab's b Plus meant that i still had a lot to learn Indian politics
 ’’class main chup rahane vaale, lekin gaur se sunne vaale yogendra ko puraane shikshak hone ke naate bhanbhari sneh bhari chetavanee bhi dete hai, ‘‘yogendra ne raajnneeti main kuch bachakaane kadam uthaae hai

 He too had the same ideal as is in Yogendra today

 But finally what happened, everyone knows
 ’’lekin raajnneeti se jude rahane kii yogendra kii laalasaa jeenyu main hi khatm nahin hui, balki baad main ve samta sanghathan se jude or phir 1995 main samaajawaadee janparishad ke saath ho gaye
 Socialist thinker and MP Kishan Patnaik was his political guru
 1996 main unhone tivi channelon par pehali baar din-raat chunaav vishleshan kiya
 Yogendra took out the JP Sampoorna Kranti Yatra in Haryana in 2001 and formed the Haryana Sampoorna Kranti Manch the following year
 2004 main aruna raay kii adhyakshata main pipuls political front banane kaa prayaas ho yaa phir 2009 main lok raajnneeti manch, aisi jagahon par yogendra baraabar sakriy rahe

 While the third life was associated with the mass movement
 yogendra kehete hai, ‘‘teen jivan ek saath jeena bahut kathin tha
 The three different lives did not even talk to each other
 ek ajeeb kism kaa sijophrenia tha
 "but by making the Aam Aadmi Party a successful weapon of political change in Delhi, they feel that the river stream has changed to sub-sections and finally reached the confluence
" ve arestu kii pankti sunaate hai, ‘‘maanviya jivan main koi vyakti sabase utkrisht kaary kar saktaa he to vah raajnneeti he

 His estranged wife, Dr

 "but Yogendra has ideological differences with Samajwadi Jan Parishad general secretary and old colleague Sunil
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ham vyavastha badalane kii raajnneeti karte hai
 But when Yogendra was going into you, we had an argument
 hamane kaha ki aam aadmi party kii koi spasht vichaardhaara nahin he, isliye ham nahin ja sakate

 After all, they are most in need of power nap, or not? pakistan kii sena ne bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav tak rajanyik pahunch die jane se inkaar kar diya he
 a few days ago, India had emphatically placed demands for diplomatic access
 jadhav (46) ko kathith jasusi ke maamle main field general court marshall ne pichley saptaah maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 India reacted sharply to this and warned Pakistan that bilateral relations could be damaged if Jadhav's 'premeditated murder' was carried out
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'kanoon ke tahat ham jasusi main shaamil kulbhushan jadhav tak rajanyik pahunch nahin de sakate
 However, Indian officials in New Delhi said that no information has been given from Pakistan regarding the denial of diplomatic access
 pakistan pichley ek saal main jadhav tak rajanyik pahunch kii bharat kii maang ko kareeb ek darjan baar thukraa chukaa he
 Major General Ghafoor said that Jadhav was involved in anti-national activities so he faced court martial

" ' baharhaal, nai dilli main bhartiya adhikariyon ne kaha ki rajanyik pahunch se inkaar kiye jane ko lekar pakistan kii taraf se koi soochna nahin di gai he
 Pakistan has rejected India's demand for diplomatic access to Jadhav nearly a dozen times in the last one year
 major general gafoor ne kaha ki jadhav raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon main shaamil tha isliye use court marshall kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The comments unhone kaha, 'yah (jadhav ko pakadana or dandit karnaa) sena kaa ferj tha

 The capital Delhi is famous for its art, cultural heritage, wide roads, but there is one thing that gives a different identity to Delhi, which is called the city of Dilwal
 dilli main jo bhi aata he uske bina nahin rah paata, yahaan tak ki desh se baahar bhi log isaki tarifon ke kaside padhate hai
 We are talking about the food of the capital Delhi
 iskaa jaayaka or swaad achche acchon ko apana divaana bana detaa he
 And a new name has been added to the list of Delhi's food fan
 sunakar thodaa atapata laga na
 
 
 But this is true
 ji haa, ye nagin dilli ke pakwaanon kii bahut badi fain he
 Now you must be wondering who is talking here

 Priyal will be seen in a lead role in a new serial 'ichchapyari Naagin' on TV
 apane sho ke pramotion ke silsile main priyal haal hi main dilli pahunchin
 After talking to press conferences and journalists, Priyal reached cp's Hanuman temple with a request for her show's success
 sho main nagin kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali priyal neshiv mandirmen puja archana kar mannath maangi
 Priyal told, 'in the show i am in the role of a serpent who fulfills everyone's wish
 asal jindagi main bhi shiv bhagwaan mere fevorett hai, aaj main dilli main hum to thodaa time nikaal kar main yahaan apane sho kii kamyaabi kii prarthana karne shiv mandir aa gai hum'
 Priyal plays the role of a wishful serpent in the show, Jonaginpur comes to earth
 insaanon se dosti kar unka dil jeetne ke liye or saath main ye sandesh lekar ki sampo ko agar chhedaa na jaae to wo khatarnaak nahin hote
 Snakes like milk, but this serpent of TV likes to eat in Delhi
 to mauka dekhte hi priyal dilli kii aalu chaat khaae bina nahin rah pain
 Priyal said, 'I like Delhi's food, especially Delhi's Aloo Chaat
 vaise to ham kalakaaron ko hameshaa dit par rahanaa padataa he lekin main jab bhi dilli aati hum to kuch nayaa jarur try karti hum
 Then go back to Mumbai and have to work a little more, you have to lose something to get something
 ' vaaki ye nagin to dilli ke khaane kii kaaphi fain lagati he tabhi to dilli kii tikhi aalu chaat ke liye unhen zyada der kasarat karne se bhi gurej nahin
 The taste of Delhi is something like that, once one tastes it, it is not easily absorbed

 Apple ios main ek bag paaya gaya he jo aas paas ke yphone ko lock kar saktaa he
 These flaws have been found in airdrop under which files are transferred between Apple devices
 is bag kaa phayda uthaa kar ataikar lagaataar files bhej sakate hai or aakhirkaar phone lock hone kii sthiti paidaa ho sakati he
 Security researcher Kishan Bagaria has revealed this bug
 aas paas ke ios divaais yani jo iphone yaa ipad wireles range main hai unamem files bhej kar phone ko lock kiya ja saktaa he
 When the file is received, ios blocks the display of the smartphone until you accept or reject the file
 phone kaa yuj block karne ke liye ataikar lagaataar files bhejte rah sakate hai
 Since the drawback in ios is that there is no provision in this operating system how many files can be received from airdrop
 ataikar lagaataar files bhej kar divaais ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Through open source tools, Bulgaria has continuously sent files to Apple devices within the airdrop range
 torget koi bhi divaais ho sakati he jo bhi wireles range main he
 He also uploaded the video on youtube, in which he is giving the demo
 kishan bagaaria ne is bag ko airdos kaa naam diya he jo ek tarah kaa dinayal of sarvice atake he jo yujar kaa acces block kuch samay tak ke liye block kar saktaa he
 It is to be noted that this bug can affect only those who have set airdrop to Everyone
 bluetooth of rahane par ye atake nahin ho saktaa he
 Bagria says that the most difficult thing is that if this attack starts then turning off the phone's Bluetooth is like impossible, because this box remains constant and you are unable to use the phone
 ab aipal ne ise thik karne ke liye apadet jari kar diya he

 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu has taken a unique initiative to tackle the problem of air pollution in the capital Delhi
 yah pahal he dilli main vaayu pradooshan failaane vaale trakon ko dilli ke border se lekar railgadee par ladakar dilli paar karana
 This railway service is known as Roll on Roll of ro-ro
 yahaan hoga pehla prayogek payalat project ke tahat rail mantralay ne 2 march se gurugram ke harsaru railway stesan se trakon ko ro-ro sarvice ke tahat uttar pradesh ke muradanagar railway stesan par pahunchane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 It is worth noting that in the Konkan Railway, ro-ro service is already being provided in a very successful manner
 pradooshan par padegaa asaris maukey par railmantri suresh prabhu ne kaha ki dilli ko logon ko jis tarah ke vaayu pradooshan kaa saamana karnaa padataa he us pradooshan kaa ek tihaai hissaa dilli se hokar aane-jane vaale trakon kii vajah se hota he
 Therefore, the railway has started loading trucks from the Delhi border and dropping them at the desired border through the train
 suresh prabhu ne patrakaron se kaha ki ro-ro seva se dilli ke pradooshan par khaasaa asar padegaa or trakon ko apane sthaan par pahunchane ke liye dilli ke border par intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 Ring railway will start again! Railway Minister said that with the addition of ro-ro service to the capital Delhi, now the Railways is preparing to make a big announcement about the Ring Railway here
 ring railway ko sakriy tareeke se phir chalaane ke liye railway par lagaataar dabaav bana hua he
 With the resumption of the Ring Railway, the people of Delhi will get a lot of relief
 2500 se 3000 rupee prati trek kirayauttar railway ke general manager aar ke kulshreshth ne ro-ro seva ke shuru hone ke saath hi rajdhani main vaayu pradooshan par asar padane kii ummid jataai he
 According to them, as per the pilot project, trucks have started to transport trucks from Harsaru railway station of Gurugram to Moradnagar railway station in Uttar Pradesh under ro-ro service
 payalat project main mili anubhav ke aadhaar par railway dilli ke aath duusare ruton par ro-ro seva shuru karegi
 When all these services start, trucks will no longer have to wait on the Delhi border
 railway ne apni is seva ke liye 2500 se 3000 rupee prati trek kaa kiraaya tay kiya he
 According to Mohammad Jamshed, Member Traffic, Railway Board, the Railway Budget for 2016-2017 was said to develop new ways to increase freight
 isi ke maddenjar dilli ensiaar kii ek badi samasya ko samaadhaan dene kii koshish railway ne kii he
 According to Mohammad Jamshed, there are about 60,000 trucks coming to Delhi NCR every day
 in trakon main se takreeban 15000 trek dilli kii seemaa main ghuskar dilli ko paar karte hue duusare rajyon main jate hai
 This simply means that these trucks are not meant for Delhi but they go to other states via Delhi
 dilli se hokar guzarane vaale in trakon ko green tex dena padataa he toll tex dena padataa he emsidi kaa tex dena padataa he
 Even after that, these vehicles can get only a few hours of night to pass through the capital
 aise main rajdhani dilli main border par raat ke vakt lambii-lambii trakon kii kataren lagati hai
 When the trucks pass through Delhi during the night, the air of the capital is heavily polluted by them
 rajdhani main badhate hue pradooshan ke chalate pichley kuch saalon se lagaataar chintaa badhati ja rahi he or iskaa samaadhaan dhundne kii tamaam naakaam koshishen kii jaati rahi hai
 Do not have to wait for hours According to member traffic Mohammad Jamshed, Delhi NCR has 127 entry and exit points in total
 lekin inamen se 9 entry or agsit point aise hai jinase hokar dilli kaa 75 fisadi trek gujarata he
 Therefore, Railways have prepared their plans for ro-ro service keeping in mind these 9 entry and exit points
 mohammad jamshed kaa kahana he ki abhi payalat project ke tahat trakon ko aar-paar le jane ke liye ek root ko kholaa gaya he
 After the response on this, the remaining 8 routes will also be opened
 unke mutabik isse jahaan trek waalon ko ab ghanton intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa to vahiin dilli-ensiaar main trakon kaa jaharila dhuaan vaataavaran ko jaharila nahin bana paaegaa
 This will reduce the traffic on Delhi roads to some extent, while the railways will also be able to earn freight on the other side
 hogi paison kii bhi bachatrelway ke adhikariyon ke mutabik ro-ro seva ke liye trakon ko takreeban teen-saadhe teen hajaar rupaye dene padenge to vahiin isse dilli se hokar guzarane vaale trek ke liye 8 se 10 ghante kii bachat ho paaegi
 Trucks using this service will not have to pay environment compensation charges
 engiti ke aadesh ke baad dilli main baari vaahanon ke upar enwyrement companseshan charge lagaaya gaya tha
 With this, trucks using ro-ro service will save from Rs 500 to ₹ 900 on entering Delhi
