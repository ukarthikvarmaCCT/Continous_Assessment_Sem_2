 rajyasabha main vichaaradhin lokapal vidheyak ko 'kamjor' or prabhaavaheen bataakar khaarij karte hue aam aadmi party (aap) netaa arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko kaha ki iske paarit hone se congress ko chhodkar kisi ko iskaa phayda nahin milegaa or rahul gandhi ko iske paarit hone kaa shrey de diya jayega
 He said that he is saddened by Anna Hazare's stand that if the Lokpal Bill under consideration is passed in the Upper House, he will break his fast
 kejariwal ne chetaya ki prastaavit kanoon bhrashtachar ko nahin roak paaegaa lekin 'bhrashton ke sangrakshan' kaa kaam karegaa
 Kejriwal said forget about any minister, if this bill is passed then even the rats will not be sentenced to jail
 main aapako aashwast kar saktaa hum ki agle 10 saal main is lokapal se ek bhi doshasiddhi nahin hogi
 i am worried about who will benefit from this Lokpal Bill
 mujhe lagata he ki congress ko laabh milegaa or iske upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko iske paarit hone kaa kuch shrey de diya jayega
 He claimed that till the CBI is made independent, which is not provided for in this bill, there will be no conviction in corruption cases
 aap netaa ne kaha ki sibiai ke 50 varshon main, agency dwaara keval chaar netaaon kii doshasiddhi hui he
 The reason for this is that those who investigate against them report to the same political bass
 kejariwal ne kaha ki agar sibiai swatantra hoti to sambhaavna hoti ki tuji yaa koyala ghotaale main pradhanmantri ko bhi jail ho sakati thi
 The party termed the Lokpal Bill as 'weak' and said that it would not stop corruption but would work for 'protection of the corrupt'
 vidheyak ke vartmaan swaroop kii aalochana karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki 11 agast 2011 main paarit vidheyak main lokapal ke liye swatantra jaanch mashinari kaa praavdhaan tha
 He said that but today, how can we accept this weak Lokpal
 ham janalokapal ke liye apana andolan jari rakhenge or logon ko yah bataaenge ki sansad hajaare ke anshan tudwane ke liye die gaye teen aashwaasano ko puraa karne main naakaam rahi he
 On the suggestions of amending the Lokpal Bill once it is passed, Kejriwal said that when they do not corruption in installments then why do they want to give the law in installments? Taking a dig at the government, he said what do they think, is it a retail curse or what? Why don't they bring tough laws at once? dilli main sarkaar ke gathan ke bare main puche jane par kejariwal ne kaha ki ve 18 mahatvapurn muddon par congress or bhaajapa ke rukh kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 He said that he is trying to do 'politics of consensus' and is not running away from responsibilities and hence has asked the stand of both parties, who are willing to 'support' his government
 kejariwal ne kaha ki congress ne kaha he ki ve bina shart samarthan de rahe hai, jabaki bhaajapa rachanaatmak samarthan de rahi he
 In the political situation, it means that we will not let you run the government and in political and love nothing is unconditional, there are certain conditions
 unhone kaha ki unhen raajnneeti khelnaa band karnaa chahie or kuch gambhir kaam karne chahie tathaa apana jawaab dena chahie
 If the three parties BJP, Congress and AAP are ready then all issues will be resolved in minutes
 aap netaa ne kaha ki ve donon dalon ke javaabon ke saath janata ke paas jaaenge or ham ise saarvajanik karenge or saarvajanik sabhaaon main ise rakhenge or unki raay maangenge
 He said that after getting answers from Congress and BJP, we will hold public meetings in 270 municipal corporation wards
 agar log hamase sarkaar banane ke liye kehete hai to ham aisa karenge or dikhaaenge ki sarkaar kaise chalati he

 Actor Aamir Khan, who hosted the show, first revealed the reason for joining the show

 sathyajith shuru se hi honhaar student rahe hai or main everej
 Satyajit used to always come first in class
 sathyajith ko shuru se hi soshal work karnaa bahut acha lagata tha
 When wept, Aamir Khan told that in college, Satyajit used to teach law to others as well as his studies
 us dauraan main ek mashhoor actor ban chukaa tha, lekin sathyajith se zyada naam kamaane ke baad bhi mujhe yah baat chubhti thi ki vah aaj bhi dusron ke liye kaam karata he or main apane liye
 Aamir Khan's poster dispute reached Parliament; Amir Khan said that he also gave many donations for social work
 lekin isse bhi unke man main wo feeling nahin ai
 Aamir said, 'during this time the TV industry was earning quite a name
 tabhi maine sathyajith ko kaha ham ek tivi sho banaate hai jisase ham socity ke liye kuch kar saken

 In this way we made up our mind to do this show

 You are sitting in front of me and taking a picture, making light in my eyes

 Due to uproar in the Lok Sabha, the motion of no confidence could not be moved once more, while the proceedings of mps retiring in Rajya Sabha had to be adjourned without any further address
 rajyasabha main aaj ek ajeeb vakya dekhne ko mila jab sadan kii kaarywahi sthagit hone ke baad bhi vipakshi saansad sadan main baithe rahe
 In fact, Speaker Venkaiah Naidu wanted the mps retiring in the House to address and share their experiences, as it has been part of the parliamentary tradition
 rajyasabha main kaveri prabandhan board ke gathan kii maang ko lekar AIADMK ke saansad lagatarvel main aakar hangamaakar rahe the
 At first, the Speaker adjourned the proceedings of the House for 15 minutes but despite this, when the action was resumed, the uproar of AIADMK mps continued
 sabhapati em venkaiya naidu ne virodh kar rahe saansadon se baithne kaa baar-baar anurodh kiya
 He even said that the credibility of the House is at stake
 Let people give farewell address to the mps
 lekin unke nahin maanane par sadan kii kaarywahi ko buudhvaar tak ke liye sthagit karnaa padaa
 During the uproar, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said that we want to let the House run

 dharm granthon main holashtak ke 8 din mangalik kaaryon ke liye ashubh maane jate hai, iske peeche kai manyataayen hai
 It is believed that Kamdev was incinerated from Bholenath to Ashtami of the month of Phalgun on trying to dissolve the penance of Lord Shiva
 prem ke devtaa kaam dev ke bhashm hote hi puure sansar main shok kii lahar fail gai thi
 Then Kamdev's wife Rati apologized to Shiva and Bholenath assured Kamdev to revive
 iske baad logon ne rang khel kar khushi manaai thi
 Holashtak is starting today, know why it is considered inauspicious
 
 
 kuch granthon main varnan miltaa he ki holi ke 8 din pehle se prahlada ko uske pita hiranyakashyap ne kaaphi yatnaaen deni shuru kar di thi or aathven din holikaa kii god main prahlaad ko baitha kar maarane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 But Holika, who got the boon of not burning in the fire, was burnt and the boy Prahlad survived
 ishwar bhakt prahlaad ke yatnaa bhare 8 dinon ko shubh nahin mana ja he
 Therefore, there is a tradition of not doing any auspicious thing
 koun se kaary naa karankisi bhi mangalik kaary ko karne ke liye shubh muhoort kaa hona bahut jaruri hota he
 This increases the chances of that task being successful
 isliye shubh kaary jaise shaadi, grihpravesh, nayaa vyapaar shuru karnaa ityadi holashtak main nahin karnaa chahie
 Which tasks can be done, such tasks which are very important for us or can be done related to birth and death
 holashtak kaa prachlan uttar bharat ke punjab, himachal, haryana, uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh main zyada he
 It is not particularly considered in other states
 holashtak kaa samay mausam ke badalane kaa samay hota he sardi ja rahi hoti he or garmi kaa mausam dastak de rahaa hota he mausam badalane ke is kram main man or sharir par bhi bahut prabhaav padataa he aise samay main mahatvapurn nirnay lene se yaa mangalik kaary karne se bachanaa chahie holikaa dahan ke saath hi saare vikaar nasht ho jate hai, aasmaan main udate gulaal, rang, abir, man main nai ullas paidaa karte hai
 Then after Holi, you can make right decisions and important work with a happy heart
 isliye yadi koi kaam bahut jaruri naa ho to thodaa ruk jaaen holi ke baad shuru karen aapako avashya safalataa milegi

 FB ke liye phir musiibat kii ghadi! 68 lakh acount par asar In Gujarat, both the Congress and the BJP are working hard to win the election
 pradhanmantri narendra modi lagaataar bijepi ke liye reliyaan kar rahe hai to congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi mahinebhar se gujarat kaa daura kar rahe hai
 But this time the caste system will be the focus of the assembly elections after the rise of caste movement in Gujarat

 The BJP has given tickets to 58 OBC candidates, while 62 candidates are in the fray from this section of the Congress

 He also referred to the development work of other BJP chief ministers

 Advani presented a bouquet to Narendra Modi on the stage, after which Modi touched Advani's feet, but Advani's gesture clearly felt that his displeasure over Modi was not yet completely over

 When Shivraj Singh Chauhan touched Advani's feet as a mark of respect, he responded warmly, but when Modi touched his feet, he folded his hands without looking at Modi

 In his address, Advani praised 24-hour power supply in Gujarat

 While Narendra Modi has come out to address a large number of rallies across the country, Advani said in his speech, Today, the BJP has reached the stage of Indian politics, not through oratory speeches, but through hard work and austerity of party workers is
 ham keval bhaashanon ke aadhaar par chunaav nahin jeet sakate, balki hamaare kaam ke aadhaar par aisa hoga
 Advani was angry at bjp's announcement of Modi's name for the post of PM and did not attend the party parliamentary board meeting on 13 September

 kudarat ne uttarakhand main baari tabaahi machaai he
 Kedarnath is the biggest waste
 puure ilaake main malba or pani bikharaa hua he
 The hotels and lodges built to accommodate the devotees have been destroyed, but despite such devastation, the temple of Baba Kedarnath remains
 tabaahi ke is manjar ke bich baba kedarnath ke mandir ko kuch nuksaan jarur pahunchaa he par baba kaa yah dham ab bhi sahi salaamat he
 Baba Kedarnapath sits at a height of 11 and a half thousand feet
 bas ab isi mandir ke bharose kedarnath kii pahchaan bachi he
 The cloudburst caused such havoc here that the entire scene around the entire Kedarnatha temple changed
 bhakthi or aasthaa ke is dham kudarat kaa yah kahar dekhakar man sinhar uthta he
 Kedarnath is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva, but the cataclysm completely destroyed Kedarnath
 is barbaadi ke bich agar bhole shankar kaa mandir bachaa rah gaya he, lekin vah bhi aadhe malbe main duba he
 The 6 feet platform on which this temple is built is not visible anywhere
 khabar he ki kedarnath ke paas kaa rambada bazaar puri tarah bah chukaa he
 The main gate of the Kedarnath temple has also been washed away due to the strong flow of water
 shraddhaluon ke rahane ke liye bane loj or hotel bhi pani kii dhar main samaa chuke hai
 Now there is nothing else but the debris and stones
 is ilaake main shraddhaluon ke liye bane kai hotel sailaab main samaa gayi, hajaaron bhakt abhi bhi fanse hue he, na jane kitne laapata he
 Rescue operations have been going on in Kedarnath continuously for the last 48 hours, army personnel are trying to rescue people from helicopters, officials said in the rescue operation that such devastation has never been seen before
 ab tak yahaan se kareeb 500 logon ko surakshit jagahon par pahunchaaya ja chukaa he
 Patkadarnath's doors open only for 6 months, only for 6 months in a year
 sardiyon main kedarnath ke kapat band rahete hai or isliye mandir ke paat khule hone ke dauraan bhakt baari sankhya main yahaan pahunch kar punya kamanaa chaahate hai
 Many travelers had come for darshan for the longing of their worship
 unamem se kuch to maut kii agosh main samaa gaye or kai log raste main fanse hone ke kaaran sahi salaamat ghar pahunchane kii dua maang rahe hai
 The way to see Baba Kedarnath, one of the most revered Jyotirlingas, is virtuous, but even a glimpse of Baba is so virtuous that the devotees just get drawn
 kedarnath kii yatra behad kathin maani jaati he or is baar kudarat ke kahar ne is durgam raste ko or kathin bana diya
 The devotees who went to see this Dham are facing many challenges throughout the journey
 kaise bana kedarnath mandiris mandir kaa nirmaan pandavon ne hajaaron varsh pehle karavaaya tha, baad main aadi guru shankaracharya ne is mandir kaa jirnonddhaar karavaaya
 The prominent Kedarnath temple among the Panchkadars has a torso appearance of Lord Shiva
 kehete hai dwapar yug main mahabharat yuddh ke baad pandav kulahatya kaa paap dhonaa chaahate the or iske liye wo bhagwaan shiv ke darshan karnaa chaahate the, lekin aughaddani to pandavon se naaraaz the or isiilie pandavon se bachane ke liye jab mahadev ne bhainse kaa rup dhaaran kiya to unka dhad yaheen gira tha, jise ab bhakt kedarnath dham ke naam se pukaarte hai
 It is said that the head of Lord Kedarnath appeared in Nepal and his arms appeared in Tungnath, in mouth Rudranath, in navel Madamsadeshwar and in Jata Kalpeshwar
 isliye in chaar sthanon sahit shri kedarnath ko panchkedaar kaha jaataa he, jinaki aradhana samast paap-ksht se mukti detii he
 The doors of Lord Kedarnath open to the devotees 6 months a year
 kapaat khulne se pehle bhagwaan bhairavnath kii puja kii jaati he or phir bhagwaan ke dwaar khole jate hai
 It is followed by the worship of Bhukund Bhairava, who is considered the Kshetrapala, but his kapat is closed in winter
 is dauraan baba kedaar ukhimath main virajte hai
 The belief behind this is that Narada Muni worships God alone for six months
 bhagwaan kedarnath ke kapaat khulte hi har bhakt ke man main laalasaa hoti he ki is dauraan bhagwaan ke darshan kar kai janmon ke punya ko praapt kar liya jaay
 The Yatra commences at Kedarnath, beginning with Gopinath at Gopeshwar
 gopeshwar se 18 kimi dur mata anusuyiya kaa mandir he, jinka aashirwad maataaon kii suuni god bhar detaa he
 Devotees reach Ukhimath through this court of the Mother, where King Mandhata, the ancestor of Shri Ram, did a harsh penance
 ukhimath hi wo pavitra dham he, jahaan sardiyon main baba kedarnath kii pavitra gaddi virajati he
 This journey of reverence reaches Fata via Ukhimath
 phata se gaurikund or phir 14 kilometre paidal yatra kar bhakt kedarnath pahunchate hai

 Our team heard the sounds of shehnai
 hamane apni pichhali reports main bataaya tha ki is shandaar resort main kis tarah kii taiyaariyaan kii ja rahi hai
 After confirming the news of marriage of Anushka, marriage on December 11, there is a question that why did the couple choose the date of December 11? This is the main reason
 sutron ke mutabik 14 disambar ke baad kharmaas shuru ho jayega
 According to Hindu customs, auspicious works are not performed in Kharmas
 lihaaja apane jivan ke sabase shubh din ke liye viraat kohli ne 11 disambar kaa shubh din chunaa he
 Anushka's family guru is currently in Italy with Kapal
 srilanka main tay hui thi shadisutron ke mutabik, agast main anoushka ke parivaar ke guru anant maharaj ne ne srilanka main viraat or anoushka se mulaakaat kii thi
 After that, the auspicious auspicious day of December 12 was observed by looking at the condition of planets and constellations
 usee samay yah faisla liya gaya tha ki iskaa khulaasa nahin kiya jayega
 This all happened during the cricket tournament

 Anushka has also taken the registration form
 viraat ne disambar main lee he lambii chuttee:viraat kohli ne oktober main bisisiai se kaha tha ki unhen kinhin nijee kaarnon se disambar main chuttee chahie
 Since then, there were speculations that Virat and Anushka could marry in December
 haalanki viraat ne kaha tha ki unhen aaraam chahie or isiilie unhone chuttee maangi he
 Is Virat also a devotee? Therefore, on Monday, Anushka's marriage, future predictions, astrologers have also started predicting
 jyotishon kii maane to shaadi se viraat or anoushka kii jindagi main or khushhaali aegi
 However, he has also warned that if both do not maintain their personal and professional lives, there may be differences
 times nau kii report ke mutabik, jyotish maalav bhatta ne kaha he ki donon ke bich bhaavnaatmak matbhed kii ashanka he, jisase maansik ashaanti rahegi
 The coming two years will be very important

 saal 2007 main mere parivaar or rishtedaaron ke khilaaf isse bhi kai guna zyada ghinauni harkate kii thim
 Even then, there was a BJP government at the Center and it made an election issue against me a matter of disproportionate assets

 Similarly, this time also BJP and company will have less profit and more loss

 Significantly, the ED conducted raids at Union Bank of India on Monday morning in Karol Bagh, Delhi

 An account in it was in the name of Mayawati's brother Anand, in which the ED received one crore 43 lakh rupees

 The funds were deposited in these two accounts after the closing of the note on 8 November and these money were deposited in pieces

 Now the Income Tax Department will check how correct the amounts in these two accounts are

 So far no case has been filed in this case nor any arrest has been made
 idi ke union bank ke is branch ke do khaaton main notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad sandigdh rup se atyadhik maatra main paisa jamaa hone kii khabar mili thi
 If sources are to be believed, 15 to 20 crore rupees are being deposited in this branch of UBI everyday, after which this was given a push
 idi ne bank se in do khaaton kaa puraa byoraa maanga he or bank adhikariyon se bank ke andar lage sisitivi footage or bank khaaton ke kevaisi dastavej dene ke liye bhi kaha he
 Mayawati's brother was under the scanner as the Income Tax Department had received several secret information that Anand Kumar had amassed several benami properties
 jaanch kadi main iskar vibhaag ne noida ke kai bilders ko notice bheja he
 Mayawati's brother Anand Kumar is alleged to have built benami properties through alliances with private builders
 bilderon ke anand kumaar ke saath sambandh he or unhone unki awaas pariyojnaon main khub kaledhan nivesh kiya he
 The Income Tax Department has sought information from these builders regarding the lands
 iske baad adaalat ne ab agarwal ko is maamle par paanch april ko uske samaksh pesh hone ke liye kaha he
 The ministry said that if the details were revealed, the breach of the agreement would affect the cordial relations between India and Russia and would be detrimental to relations with a foreign nation

 Is our country's law weak regarding rape? Do rapists not get severe punishment? From Nirbhaya to Aaj Tak, whenever a case of rape comes up, weak laws and lesser punishment are always called for
 haalanki sachai ye he ki balaatkaar ke maamle main bhi sazaa-e-maut kaa praavdhaan he
 Actually, the truth is that the laws are strict but it takes time to punish
 nirbhaya ke gunahagaaron ko hi le lijie, aaj bhi faansee kaa fanda unke gale tak nahin pahunchaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason that now for the first time in the country, the demand for law like Sharia for rapists has been raised and this demand has come from Kashmir
 pehle kathua phir shimla or unnav
 
 or ab bandipora main maasoom bacchee ke saath gangrape kii sharmnaak vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya
 People's anger is bursting on the streets
 vipaksh sarkaar par hamale kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, many people are talking about Sharia law
 kuch kaa kahana he ki rape jaisi ghatnaon ko anjaam dene vaale darindon ko sharia kanoon ke anusaar, pathar markar maut kii sajaa deni chahie
 Meanwhile, Nirbhaya's mother's statement also comes from Delhi
 wo kahati hai "nirbhaya ke doshiyon ko faansee kab hogi
 Just saying, 'beti Padhao Beti Bachao', nothing happens
 kuch karnaa bhi padataa he
 "on the other hand, the Prime Minister of the country says in his political rallies that the culprits are being hanged in such cases as soon as possible
 sach to ye he ki pichley 15 saal se hindustan main rape ke kisi bhi aaropee ko faansee nahin di gai
 Dhananjay Chatterjee was last hanged in Kolkata in 2004 for raping a 14-year-old girl
 haalanki in 15 saalon main kanoon to bahut bane magar naa to nirbhaya ke balaatkaari faansee chadhe
 Neither the leader who raped a Dalit woman in Unnao
 naa hi kathva ke doshi
 These numbers are very long
 itani ki sarkaar ne 2016 ke baad se rape ke aankade jari karne hi band kar die
 Now once again, after the rape of a 3-year-old innocent girl in Bandipora, the voice has started raising
 aawaaj ye ki kyon naa balaatkaariyon ko sharia kanoon ke tahat sazaa di jaae
 9 May 2019 Sambal, Bandipora, Kashmir a 20-year-old young man living in the neighborhood was kidnapped by a greed of toffee first from home and then taken to a deserted area and made him a victim of his lust
 iske baad badahavaas haalat main use vahiin chhodkar chalaa gaya
 After a long search, the girl was found in the nearby fields
 jise aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 The family members informed the police
 police ne fouran aaropee ko giraftaar bhi kar liya
 But as soon as information about the incident went out, people started demanding punishment for the accused
 virodh main pradarshan, siyasat garmvaardaat kii khabar milte hi puri ghati main gussa foot padaa
 In protest, people announced a shutdown on Sunday and took to the streets
 badgam, baraamula srinagar or bandipora ke kai ilaakon main bazaar or kaarobaar band rahe
 The fire of the Bandipora rape case had reached political circles by now
 jammu kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne ne is repakand ke baad ek alag hi bahes ched di
 Mehbooba Mufti said that the accused of rape should be dealt with under strict law like Sharia
 taaki phir koi vahashi kisi maasoom ke sach aisa karne kii himmat himmat naa kar sake
 These countries have strict laws
 In countries like Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, the accused of rape are punished under Sharia law
 haalanki shariya kanoon puri tarah bharat main lagu nahin he
 Muslim personal is definitely in India
 aise main sawaal ye he ki aakhir rape ke aropiyon ke liye sharia main kya kanoon he?kya he shariahsharia darasal islamic samaaj ke andar rahane ke unheen niyamon kaa ek samooh he
 Which governs Islamic society all over the world
 jaankaar maanate hai ki isamen istemaal hone vaale kanoon kuran or haddees se liye gaye hai
 The Shariah narrates laws to live socially, religiously, politically, economically and culturally within Islam
 ye bataata he ki in tamaam pahaluon ke bich ek musalmaan ko kaise zindagi jini chahie
 There is a strict law in Sharia regarding rape and atrocities with women
 masalan saream kode maarna
 to stone
 suuli par latakaana
 Behead it jannang ko kaat dena
 Equal laws for all As far as India is concerned, the Indian constitution provides equal rights of living to people of all religions, castes
 lekin jahaan tak islam ke maanane waalon kii baat he to musalamaanon ke gharelu, paariwarik, usamen bhi khaskar shaadi, talaak, bacchon ke maamalon or miyaan-bivi, maa-baap ke bich sabhi maamalon kaa samaadhaan sharia kanoon ke hisaab se hi nikaala jaataa he
 Indian law does not interfere with that
 magar jis tarah alvar or ab bandipora main rape kii ghatnaayen huin uske baad mahabuuba ke sharia kanoon ke tahat aise aropiyon se nipatane ke bayaan ne is baat par nai bahes jarur ched di he
 'india is moving towards cashless economy'
 aisa sunne ko mila hoga, kyonki 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note bain yani dimonetigeshan ke baad ab sarkaar logon se cashles hone ko kah rahi he
 Long queues outside the ATM are not taking names, and the use of atms is continuously increasing
 aise main america security form fire ai kii sibar atake judi yah report desh ke liye gambhir sabit ho sakati he
 US Cyber security Agency Fire Eye has reported in the report 'security Landscape Asia Pacific Edition 2017', 'in APAC countries we have seen a greater focus on cyber attack on atms, including India
 in deshon ke atm ko bhednaa aasaan he
 Apart from this, the old operating system Windows XP is still used in these atms
 isliye ye soft torget hai
 'these are the five reasons why cashless economy is far from worthless to deal with fraud of hacked economy' IT Act Cyber security expert and Supreme Court lawyer Neeraj Arora believes that India's IT Act is not enough to deal with online fraud is
 unhone ek angreji akhbaar ko bataaya he ki iti act kii dhara 66,66A,66C or 66D jo fishing, farji email link or frod se nipatane ke liye he, lekin iske tahat police doshi ko hiraasat main nahin le sakati he
 The culprit gets a bail in all these goods
 data protection ke liye bhi koi thos kanoon nahin he, isliye customers ko is baat kaa dar hona laazmi he ki uskaa data koi chura na le
 Apart from this, there is no privacy law so that at least during e-transactions, customers can be sure that they are safe
 kamjor sibar security or ranjamaverasibar security ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya kanoon ranjamaware ke khataron ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 In the current era, the risk of ransomware is increasing rapidly in India, under which people are asked for money to encrypt computers and open them
 security agenciyon kii maane to bharat main ye khatra duusare mulkon ke mukaable zyada teji se bad rahaa he, kyonki yahaan iske rokthaam ke liye kuch pukhta nahin he
 In such cases also, the guilty gets bail

 Loots have reduced in banks here

 This figure was the lowest in 30 years
 lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu yah rahaa he ki yahaan sibar krimes main badhotaree aa gai
 According to the Speedish National Council for Crime Prevention, cyber bank fraud grew rapidly and reached 20,000 in 2011 as compared to only 3,304 in 2000
 sweden aisa desh he jise global informansion technology main number-1 mana jaataa he
 Even after so many security majors in Sweden, when cyber loot can increase, what will happen to a country like India, where 15 years old operating system is still being used in atms? Obviously, the number of cybercriminals will increase and people will also fall victim to it
 slo internet speedzyaadaatar cashles tranjaction ke liye yugers ko acchhee speed vaale internet kii zarurat hoti he
 But the internet situation in India is quite disappointing
 aise main seshan time out, pement feld,internet disconect, network erar or otipi kasmay par na milanaa logon ke dincharya main shaamil hai
 These may be called small problems, but they are serious, because many times work is done due to these reasons
 iske alaava maujuuda samay main yah bhi dekha ja rahaa he ki vakt be vakt POS mashin kaam karnaa band kar detii hai or aise main aapke paas cash na ho to aap jaruri saamaan tak nahin kharid sakate
 Everyday Electronic Problems Cashless transactions require smartphones, personal computers and Internet connectivity
 lekin agar aapkaa phone achaanak band ho gaya yaa bydaree khatm ho gai to aap kya karenge? network chalaa gaya to kya karenge?agar aapke digital wolet ko kisi ne remoteli shat down kar diya to kya hoga?banking se judaa aapkaa personal data kahin na kahin sarwar par store hoga jahaan se churaana havers ke liye zyada mushkil nahin he
 All these are very basic problems, because if told from the point of view, the dangers of cashless economy without any arrangement will seem even more frightening

 They carry out aggressive attacks against Gadkari's claims of development

 Why did he not keep his promise? ”the next day, four-time MP from Nagpur, Muttemwar invited me for breakfast at his residence in front of the beautiful garden of Shankar Nagar
 naashte main main idli or pohe kaa swaad chakhne laga to mutemvaar ne bataaya ki peeth kii samasya ke kaaran ve chunaav se peeche hat gaye

 Gadkari goes to some annoyance with the claims of his opponents but says he does not want to get involved on the issue
 ve sirf is baat par jor dete hai ki mihaan pariyojna kii ruparekha tab tay kii gai thi jab ve rajya main mantri the
 While tasting dal, rice and delicious drunken curry at his Ramnagar residence at lunch, Gadkari listed a long list of projects he had undertaken in Nagpur, ranging from road to healthcare, electric taxis and buses and even That included cultural efforts organized by his efforts
 ve vistaar se kehete hai, ''maine jo bhi shuru kiya, usko lekar meri 101 pratishat javabdehi he
 i brought schemes worth over 70,000 crores for Nagpur
 main pariyojnavar suchi duungaa or aap ise apane str par satyapit kar sakate hai
 What happened to the promise of a separate Vidarbha state? In response, Gadkari says, "we are committed to this and a day will come when we will get a separate state
" ''gadakari patole ke is aarope se bhi kuch khafa hai ki unhone nijee laabh ke liye shahar main jal vitaran kaa nijeekaran kiya he

 "gadkari does not want to show how much he is hurt by such allegations
 meri ankhon main dekhte hue, vah dridhtaa se kehete hai, ''main 2012 se kaarobaar se judaa nahin hum
 i resigned from all my businesses
 main kabhi bhi kaarobaari nahin rahaa, main ek saamaajik udhyami tha
 You can also see my track record as a Union Minister

 "his amiable nature, his spirit of taking opponents along and his dedication to achieve ambitious development goals give Gadkari access to almost all political circles

 He dismisses such things, saying, "I have no such ambition
" main pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri nahin bananaa chahta

 This crowd of travelers includes Anmol Pandey, a local university's lab assistant with his two-year-old son Avneesh and his wife Sneha

 "we are proud of it," says Pandey
 hamen nahin lagata ki yah paise kii barbaadi he
 i never imagined that we could get some development
 gadakariji taskmaster hai or jo vaada karte hai, use puraa bhi karte hai
 We will definitely vote for them only
 or modiji ko bhi
 "on the occasion of the election, Gadkari's heart should be agitated at such a response from a family member of his constituency

 raashtrapati ne kaha, ''sanga hamaare desh kii pahchaan hai or main khushi ke saath unhen britain main srilanka kaa ucchayukta banane kii peshkash karata hum''
 The audience present at the stadium was greeted with applause on the offer made to the President's Sanga
 sanga hai kamishnar pad kii jimmedaari lenge yaa nahin ye philhal tay nahin he lekin duniya bhar ke cricket phans kaa unhone dil jarur jeet liya he
 Sanga played for English county team Surrey last season
 tippaniyan In his 15-year cricket career, Sanga amassed over 27 thousand runs
 is dauraan sangakara ne test main 38 or vanade main 25 shatkeey paariyaan khelin
 On behalf of the Indian team, captain Virat Kohli gave the shirt signed by the players of Team India as a gift to Sanga
 match ke baad srilankai raashtrapati ne 37 saal ke kumaar sangakara ko britain main srilanka kaa hai-kamishnar kaa pad lene kii peshkash kii he
 The President said, "sanga is the identity of our country and i gladly offer him to become the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Britain"
 raashtrapati ke sanga ko die gaye ofer par stadium main maujuud darshakon ne taaliyaan bajaakar swaagat kiya
 Whether or not Sanga will take the responsibility of the post of High Commissioner is not currently decided, but he has definitely won the hearts of cricket fans around the world
 sanga pichley sijan english county team sarre ke liye khel chuke hai
 The comments apane 15 saal ke cricket kariyar main sanga ne 27 hajaar se zyada ran batore
 During this time Sangakkara played 38 in Tests and 25 in odis
 bhartiya team kii taraf se bhi captain viraat kohli ne team india ke khilaadiyon kaa sin kiya hua shart sanga ko uphaar ke rup main diya

 There are 11 candidates in the fray for 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh in tomorrow's Rajya Sabha election
 soobe ke maujuuda vidhayakon kii sankhya ke lihaaj se bijepi ke 8 or sapa ke ek sadsy kii jeet tay he
 There is a close fight between bjp's 9th candidate Anil Aggarwal and bsp's only candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar
 aise main basapa supremeo mayawati ne sapa ke un 9 vidhayakon kii list maangi he, jo pratham variyata main bispi ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ke liye vot karenge
 SP has also fulfilled this demand of Mayawati in a short time
 sapa ne 9 vidhayakon kii list basapa ko saunp di he, jo variyata se bhimrao ambedkar ke liye vot denge
 In the Anil Aggarwal vs Bhimrao Ambedkar contest, the ruling BJP and the opposition are calculating one vote each to win
 rajyasabha chunaav main vidhayakon kii cross voting kaa dar bhi he
 This is the reason why BSP President Mayawati has asked Samajwadi Party to release the list of 9 trusted mlas for her candidate
 jo bispi ummidavaar ko pratham variyata ke aadhaar par vot karenge
 If Akhilesh agrees to these demands of Mayawati, then there may be trouble in the victory of Jaya Bachchan, the declared candidate of Samajwadi Party
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne apane iklaute rajyasabha ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko jitaane ke liye aaj apane vidhayakon kii baithak bulaai he
 If sources are to be believed, the BAPAP is suspected of breaching the party, so Mayawati will meet each MLA herself and understand their mood
 bispi ke jeet kaa daaromadar vipaksh parabspi ke paas 19 vidhayak hai
 In the same way, the victory of BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar depends on the opposition
 jabaki sapa, congress or areldi ne bispi ummidavaar ko rajyasabha chunaav main samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he
 But Mayawati wants to be satisfied about her candidate's victory, that is why she has placed a bet in front of the SP
 basapa kaa ganitamayawati apane vidhayakon ke saath sapa or congress se ummid lagaae hue hai
 However, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has given full strength to win the BSP candidate
 buudhvaar ko chachaa shivpal yadav or nirdaleey vidhayak raghuraaj pratap singh ko apni dinar party main bulaakar apni siyaasi takat kaa ehsaas bijepi ko kara diya
 Raghuraj Pratap has his own and one vote from his colleague Vinod Saroj
 is tarah unke paas do vot hai
 Both these votes are considered very important for Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ke samikarnadrasal soobe kii sabhi partiyaan apana-apana kila bachaane main juty hai
 a Rajya Sabha seat needs 37 votes to win
 bijepi apane sahyogiyon ke saath 8 rajyasabha siton par aasaani se jeet jaaegi
 After this, 28 votes are left
 aise main 9veen seat ke pratyaashee anil agarwal ko jitaane ke liye use 9 or voton kii jarurat padegi
 The BJP is hopeful of its victory with the help of independents and rebel mlas of the SP-BSP

 This engineer left a package of millions, started the business of selling tea, a means of livelihood for the farmers, the turnover of Kolendra's Agri business company is more than five crores and most importantly, his company is helping about 20,000 farmers

 The lives of more than 20 thousand farmer families are linked to his company

 Barring the southern part, the opinion of the entire country is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be given a chance for another term
 india today political stock exange (PSE) ke naunve sanskaran ke mutabik puure desh main 46 fisadi pratibhaagiyon ne narendra modi ke paksh main hi aglaa pradhanmantri banane ke liye vot diya
 In the PSE survey, 32% of the voters declared Congress President Rahul Gandhi as their choice for the Prime Minister
 vahiin 22 fisadi voter is par spasht raay vyakt nahin kar sake
 The India Today- Axis My India survey is based on phone-based interviews from 540 Lok Sabha constituencies of the country
 is survey main kul 2,16,235 pratibhaagiyon ne hissaa liya
 The survey was conducted from 25 August to 31 October
 uttar, purv or pashchim main modi ko badhat, dakshin main rahul agesurve se saamne aayaa ki desh ke uttari, purv or pashchimi hisson main lokapriyata ke maamle main pradhanmantri modi kaa graph rahul gandhi ke mukaable kahin ooncha he
 In the southern part only, Rahul has left Modi behind
 modi ko uttar main 45%, purv main 50% or pashchim main 52% voter agle kaarykaal ke liye bhi pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 At the same time, only 27% of the participants in Rahul North, 25% in East and 33% in West declared their choice for Prime Minister
 jahaan tak dakshin kaa sawaal he to vahaan baazi ulti nazar ai
 Here 40% of the voters expressed their opinion in favor of Rahul for the Prime Minister
 vahiin modi ko sirf 37% votaron kaa hi samarthan mil sakaa
 Election analyst Yogendra Yadav agrees that Narendra Modi is ahead in the race for the post of Prime Minister, but at the same time says that there has been a sharp decline in Modi's popularity
 yadav kehete hai, ‘ye kaaphi had tak saaf he ki rahul gandhi se narendra modi aage hai
 In 2014, Modi's popularity doubled, including Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh
 ek saal pehle tak may 2017 main modi kii lokapriyata rahul, sonia or manmohan singh se milakar teen guna thi
 It is now one and a half times
 jahaan tak sarkaar kii lokapriyata kaa sawaal he to pichley saal ke mukaable kahin nahin tikti
 'politician Sandeep Shastri says,' Modi is ahead of Rahul Gandhi, but the gap has decreased
 bijepi ise netritv kaa muqabla bananaa chaahati he, lekin congress aisa nahin chaahati
 According to the structure of the competition at this time, the race has become very close
 kisi netaa kii lokapriyata party ke liye siton kii jeet main tabdeel nahin hoti
 At the same time, political analyst Manisha Priyam says, "modi is ahead but he has not crossed the 50% mark in any category
" ye dekhnaa dilachasp he ki anyon ko bhi 20 se 25% vot mili hai
 If such a downward trend continues, which is happening, then it can turn in the third direction
 2019 rajyon ke chunaavon kaa jod hone ja rahaa he
 The real challenge is to combine others with Rahul Gandhi
 ’modi sarkaar kaa kaamkajajahan tak modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa sawaal he to desh bhar main 44% voter isse santusht dikhe
 30% of the voters in the survey expressed displeasure over the functioning of the Modi government
 vahiin 20% votaron ne modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko ausat bataaya
 Another important conclusion came out of the survey that in the states, whether the government is of BJP or any opposition party, people everywhere seem more satisfied and less unhappy with the functioning of the Modi government
 agar bijepi kii aguai vaale endie shasit 19 rajyon kii baat kii jaae to vahaan 48% voter modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se santusht dikhe
 In these states, 29% voters expressed displeasure over the functioning of the Modi government
 vahiin agar gaiyr bijepi shasit 11 rajyon kii baat kii jaae to vahaan 39% votaron ne modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par santosh jataayaa
 Here 32 per cent of the voters expressed displeasure over the functioning of the Modi government
 bijepi kii aguai vaale endie shasit 19 rajyon main uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, madhya pradesh, gujarat, rajasthan, assam, jharkhand, chhattisgarh, haryana, uttarakhand, himachal pradesh, goa, arunachal pradesh, manipur, meghalaya, tripura, nagaland or sikkim shaamil hai
 These states have 318 Lok Sabha seats
 gaiyr bijepi shasit 11 rajyon main pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, karnataka, andhra pradesh, odisha, kerala, telugana, punjab, dilli, mizoram or pudducheri shaamil hai
 a total of 214 Lok Sabha seats are at stake from these states
 bijepi netaa amit malviya apni party main vishwaas jataate hue kehete hai, ‘bijepi or uske sahyogi 70 fisadi rajyon main shashan kar rahe hai
 In the context of Lok Sabha, this is a big advantage
 beete saadhe chaar saal main bijepi kaa vot share 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke maamle 12 fisadi badha he
 At the same time, election analyst Yogendra Yadav believes that the kind of chaos surrounding the country's top agencies will harm the bjp's prospects
 yadav kehete hai- ‘bijepi ke 200 siton ke paar karne yaa is aankade ko chune kii koi surat nahin he agar teen ‘ai’ yani sibiai, arabiai or CJI ne or kadaa mode liya to bijepi ke liye halaat or kharaab ho sakate hai
 As far as the Congress is concerned, it has failed to arouse any hope or enthusiasm
 aisi koi jagah nahin jahaan congress ko nai jameen mil rahi ho
 However, Congress spokesperson Pawan Kheda, citing the issues raised vigorously, said, "the voters are forcing politicians to change their partners, this in itself is an indication that there are no good signs for Modi and his political clan
" is
 ham sahi mudde uthaa rahe hai
 Whoever they may be - farmers' issues, women's safety, corruption, petrol and diesel prices, unemployment etc
 ’bijepi shasit rajya hon yaa gaiyr bijepi shasit rajya, lokapriyata ke maamle main modi kaa graph rahul gandhi se ooncha he
 In bjp-ruled states, 51 percent voters want Modi and 29 percent voters to see Rahul as the next Prime Minister
 jahaan tak gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon kaa sawaal he to pradhanmantri ke liye 40 fisadi votaron ne modi or 34% votaron ne rahul ke paksh main raay vyakt kii
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and BSP supremo Mayawati are given 2-2 per cent for the Prime Minister, 1-1 per cent votes to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Telangana CM KC Chandrasekhar Rao, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik and NCP CM Sharad Pawar
 Told the choice
 ahm muddekun sa mudda desh bhar main logon ko sabase zyada prabhavit kar rahaa he to PSE survey main sabase zyada 42 fisadi votaron ne naala / naalee / saaf-safai kaa naam liya
 Among other important issues, voters took the name of issues like inflation, agriculture and farmers' problems, unemployment, shortage of drinking water
 jatigat samikrmgar jatigat samoohon kii baat kii jaae to muslimon ko chhod kar sabhi virgon main lokapriyata ke maamle main pradhanmantri modi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se aage hai
 In the PSE survey, 48% of the Scheduled Tribe (ST) voters expressed their support for Modi and 31% for the Prime Minister
 anusuchit jati (SC) ke votaron main 46 fisadi modi ko or 33 fisadi rahul ko desh kaa aglaa pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Among Other Backward Classes (OBC) voters, 54 per cent of the people expressed their opinion in favor of Modi for PM
 is varg main sirf 26 fisadi voter hi rahul gandhi ko desh kaa aglaa piem banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Modi's popularity was seen in the most common category
 survey main is varg se 56 fisadi voter chaahate hai ki piem ke liye modi ko ek or kaarykaal mili
 Only 25% of the voters from this category want to see Rahul become PM
 jahaan tak muslim votaron kaa sawaal he to survey se saaf he ki is varg main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne piem modi par baari badhat banaai hui he
 According to the PSE survey, 56% of Muslim voters are in favor of making Rahul Gandhi the next Prime Minister of the country
 muslim votaron main se sirf 16 fisadi hi modi ko piem ke liye ek or kaarykaal dene ke paksh main hai
 More Popularity of Modi among Women Another interesting fact emerged from the PSE survey that Modi's popularity is more among women than men
 purush votaron kii baat kii jaae to survey main 45 fisadi ne pradhanmantri ke liye modi ke paksh main raay vyakt kii
 Among male voters, 34 percent voted for the choice of Prime Minister Rahul
 jahaan tak mahila votaron kaa sawaal he to survey main 47 fisadi ne modi or 31 fisadi ne rahul gadhi ko pradhanmantri ke liye apni pasand bataaya
 In urban versus rural areas, whether in rural areas or rural, Modi has an edge over Rahul Gandhi
 PSE survey ke mutabik gramin kshetron main 44% voter modi ko or 33% rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Modi's popularity in urban areas is more than in rural areas
 survey se saamne aayaa ki shahari kshetron main 48 fisadi votaron ne modi or 30 fisadi ne rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri ke liye apni pasand bataaya

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa ke bajaay chote dalon ko saadhane kii disha main jute gai hai
 In this episode, after joining the first great party with him, now he has his eye on Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party, discussed by SP President Akhilesh Yadav
 ise lekar tab kayaas lagaae jane lage jab congress emelsi or priyanka gandhi ke kareebi maane deepak singh ne shivpal yadav ke saath mulaakaat kii or donon netaaon kii tasviir saamne aane ke baad siyaasi myne nikaale jane lage hai
 Discussion has also intensified in the political circles that Priyanka Gandhi and Shivpal Yadav have had a phone conversation on this issue
 lekin is baat kii pushti na to shivpal yadav ne kii or na hi congress ke camp se koi kar paa rahaa he
 But after coming to Deepak Singh's photo with Shivpal, it has become clear that some khichdi is brewing between the two parties
 siyaasi galiyaaron main priyanka or shivpal yadav ke bich phone se baatcheet hone ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 However, it is true that the Congress leaders are in touch with the leaders of the Progressive Samajwadi Party and Shivpal Yadav has also expressed his desire for an alliance with the Congress
 congress netaa piel puniya or shivpal yadav ek duusare ke sampark main he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia is constantly seeking opinions from Congress leaders in their meetings about the alliance
 gathbandhan karne yaa nahin karne ko lekar sawaal bhi puch rahe hai
 Priyanka Gandhi, who is the Congress general secretary and in charge of the party in eastern UP, is also consulting leaders with the alliance
 bataa den ki uttar pradesh main congress or mahaan dal ke bich mangalvaar ko phir gathbandhan ho gaya
 Keshav Dev Maurya, president of the great party, met Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia in Lucknow
 is dauraan unhone congress ke gathbandhan kii peshkash kii, jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 Priyanka said, 'she welcomes Maurya and we will contest the next Lok Sabha elections together
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hamen lakshya diya he ki aisi raajnneeti kaa nirmaan karen jisamen sabhi kaa pratinidhitiv ho
 This alliance is an effort in that direction
 ham 2019 kii ladaai ji jaan se ladenge
 At the same time, Maurya, the president of the Mahan Dal, said on this occasion that only the Congress has thought and acted on all the interests including reservation of Dalits and backward
 sirf yahi party sabko saath lekar chalane kii soch rakhti he
 In the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Mahan Dal has an alliance with the Congress
 mahaan dal ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress se gathbandhan main badaayun, nagina or eta siton par chunaav ladaa tha, magar yahaan haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, it is now to see which regional party comes next in alliance with Congress after alliance with Mahan Party

 pichley 15 dinon kaa siyaasi suspence aaj khatm hone vaala he
 The national capital Delhi is going to get the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government
 lagbhag tay ho gaya he ki dilli main 'aap' sarkaar kaa gathan karegi
 Arvind Kejriwal is going to meet Lt
 Governor to stake claim to form government
 kejariwal kii maane to khuli sabhaaon, esemes yaa duusare madhyamon se ikattha kii gai janata kii raay main 80 fisadi logon kaa yahi farmaan he ki aam aadmi party hi dilli kii nai hukmran bane
 Out of the 70 assembly seats in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has got 8 seats less than the majority i
e
 28 seats
 lekin siyasat ke bhavarjaal ne aisa taana bana taiyaar kiya ki haa-naa, haa-naa karte-karte aakhirkaar dilli main aap kii sarkaar banane tak baat pahunch hi gai
 On 25 or 26 December, you can take the oath, the CM of AAP, Arvind Kejriwal will meet the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi and claim to form the government
 sutron kii maane to 25 yaa 26 disambar ko dilli main aam aadmi party sarkaar ke mukhyamantri shapath le sakate hai
 There is also a claim that a special session of Delhi Assembly will be called within 15 days of the formation of AAP government in Delhi
 or aam aadmi party apane sabase bade chunavi vaade janalokapal bill ko paas karaane kii koshish karegi
 After 15 days of suspense and a political drama of referendum, the party in Delhi is on the threshold of forming a government, which is just 1 year old, which contested for the first time, which defeated the largest parties in the country for decades
 koun banegaa siemdilli main aap kii sarkaar banegi lekin koun banenge mukhyamantri, kaisaa hoga mantrimandal? sabase bada sawaal ye ki satta main badlaav ke baad kya raajnneeti kii surat bhi badalegi arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party?hindustan kii najar na sirf ye jaanane ke liye baichaiyn he ki dilli main kab sarkaar banane kaa suspence khatm hoga, balki ye jaanane ke liye bhi baichen he ki dilli kii nai sarkaar kaa dhaancha, swaroop or rang dhang kaisaa hoga
 If novices of politics become ministers then what and how will they do charisma? Do not even learn the story of politics from the arrogant mlas who are going to sit in the opposition, how will your mlas deal? Kejriwal will change the face of Delhi's politics: Aam Aadmi Party has already announced that VIP culture will not work in his government
 masalan aap kii sarkaar ke mantri na laal batti gaadi lenge, na sarkari bangala aap ke mantri or vidhayak baari suraksha ke tamzam se bhi dur rahengesiem se lekar mantri or vidhayak tak sabhi raajnneeti main saadagi ke nae pairokaar honge
 For example, Kejriwal, who killed Delhi in the first battle, will change the face of the politics of Delhi and the way the government functions
 ab janata ne hi kejariwal or aam aadmi party ko raajnneeti main badlaav ke mohare ke taur par aajamaaya he or is mohare par bharosa jataayaa he to kejariwal and team bhi peeche kyon hate
 So get ready to see the new colors of politics
 badlaav kii sisaayat kaa nayaa cheharaa dekhne ke liye
 Will Kejriwaljitana trust Delhi to live up to the expectations of the people, Delhi has expressed itself to you, you will also have to live up to the expectations in the same way
 sasti bijli, muft pani, 15 din main jan lokapal bill jaise bade bade daawey kaise puraa karenge arvind kejariwal? arvind kejariwal ne janata ko jitne sabjbag dikhaaen hai, dilli main aap kii sarkaar bani to un vaadon ko puraa bhi karnaa hoga
 Today's biggest question is whether Kejriwal will be able to live up to the expectations of Delhi
 kahin kejariwal ke bade-bade vaade duusari partiyon kii tarah hi chunavi vaade hi to nahin rah jaaenge? ye avishvaas isliye kyonki kejariwal ne chunavi baaji jeetne ke kiye vaade bhi aasmaan se taare tod laane vaale kar die-- 4 maheene ke andar bijli bill 50 fisadi ghataane kaa vaada kaise puraa karegi aap kii sarkaar?- har roj dilli main har parivaar ko 700 litre pani muft dene kaa vaada kaise puraa hoga?jaankaar to kehete hai ki 15 din main jan lokapal bill paas karne kaa sabase bada chunavi vaada puraa karne main bhi aam aadmi party ke paseene chhot jaaenge
 And if Kejriwal is able to pass the Jan Lokpal bill after all the hard work, then its validity will be under question
 aisa lagata he ki jin vaadon ke dam par kejariwal ne chunavi baaji jiti, sach ye he ki unheen vaadon ke bhavarjaal main kejariwal buree tarah ghirne vaale hai
 Even if your government is formed in Delhi, it will prove to be the crown of thorns

 Important meeting is being held at Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's house

 No democracy in AAP- Ajit Jha said on the withdrawal of AAP from NE, Ajit Jha said that after the incident which happened in the National Council, we are not in a position to say that there is democracy in the party
 hamaara netritv aantarik loktantr ke paksh main nahin he
 Arvind Kejriwal's gesture does everything, he is in possession of the party's account

 On Saturday, it was Arvind's decision to call the meeting, conduct, fill in the non-members
 vahiin duusari taraf AAP ke purv vidhayak rajesh garg ne party ke lokapal admiral ramdaas ko chitthee likhakar NC baithak par sangyaan lene kii maang kii he
 What will happen next in AAP? On Saturday, there was a lot of uproar in the National Council meeting

 Apart from these, Professor Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha were also expelled from the National Executive
 iske baad har kisi ke jahan main bas yahi ek sawaal he ki hataae gaye aap netaa yogendra yadav,prashanth bhushan,anand kumaar or ajit jha ab kya karenge

 vaise neshnal ekjicutive se hataae jane ke thik baad yogendra yadav ne loktantric hone kaa dhindhora peetane vaali aam aadmi party par loktantr kii hatya kaa aarope to laga hi diya
 Now the question is whether these senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party will continue to question the functioning of the party
 party main maujuud khaamiyon ko ujagar karte rahenge
 After the meeting of the National Council, the rebel leaders held a separate meeting
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kahin alag party banane kii taiyaari to nahin he
 Because the way Prashant Bhushan is discussing the popularity of Yogendra Yadav, he points to this
 vaise hataae gaye professor anand kumaar philhal party main rahakar party ko sudhaarney kii baat bhi kah rahe hai
 But at the moment, seeing the taunt of these rebel leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party, it is not possible that they want to continue in the Aam Aadmi Party even further
 agar aisa hota to party ke faisle ke khilaaf court jane kii baat hi nahin karte
 However, the party's stance does not appear to be soft on rebel leaders
 shanivaar der raat sanyojak arvind kejariwal ke ghar par party kii baithak hui jisamen bhoomi adhigrahan bill par abhiyaan chhedane se lekar dilli sarkaar ke kaam par dhyaan dene kii baat hui
 Discussion was also held on forming four committees
 lekin baagi netaaon par do took kaha gaya ki ve jo karnaa chaahate hai karen
 In such a situation, it is clear that the Aam Aadmi Party has tried to calm the matter by removing rebel leaders from the National Executive, but the party will also have an eye on what will be the next strategy of Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan, Ajit Jha and Professor Anand Kumar

 So come, today we tell you - sabase pehle yah samajhnaa hoga ki makaan kiraaya bhatte par inakam tex chhot paane ke hakdaar koun log hai
 
 
 The most important thing for this is that you get house rent allowance in salary, and the house you are claiming to pay rent should not be in your name

 For example, if a person receives Rs 25,000 as basic salary, and Rs 12,500 as HRA item, and he actually pays only Rs 12,500, then he will get a rebate of Rs 10,000 only

 Another thing to remember is that if you are paying more than Rs 1,00,000 per year (ie Rs 8,333 per month), then the PAN number of the landlord (irrespective of the mother or father or wife) is to be entered
 Also mandatory, and they have to pay tax on this income
 
 
 so, yaad rahe, makaan kiraaya bhatte par iskar chhot paane ke liye zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or bhugtan kii raseeden maujuud hon
 
 
 a similar declaration is made by those who live in a rented house, and who receive a house rent allowance (house rent allowance or HRA) in salary (salary or salary)
 
 
 makaan kiraaya bhatta aamtaur par sachmuch kiraaye par rahane waalon ko inakam tex main kaaphi bachat karwaata he, so, uski sahi ghoshnaa karnaa behad zaruri he, lekin zyaadaatar naukareepesha logon ko yahi samaj main nahin aata he ki use kaise hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 
 
 So come, today we tell you - sabase pehle yah samajhnaa hoga ki makaan kiraaya bhatte par inakam tex chhot paane ke hakdaar koun log hai
 
 
 The most important thing for this is that you get house rent allowance in salary, and the house you are claiming to pay rent should not be in your name
 
 
 darasal, inakam tex act ke section 10 (13 e) ke tahat kisi bhi vetanbhogi ko uske mul vetan kaa 50 fisadi, echaare ke mad main milane vaali rakam yaa chukaaye gaye vaastavik kiraaye main se mul vetan kaa 10 fisadi ghataane par bachi teen rakamon main se sabase kam rakam par iskar se chhot milti he
 
 
 For example, if a person receives Rs 25,000 as basic salary, and Rs 12,500 as HRA item, and he actually pays only Rs 12,500, then he will get a rebate of Rs 10,000 only
 
 
 darasal, chukaaye gaye kiraaye kii rakam (12,500) main se mul vetan kaa 10 fisadi (2,500) ghataane par yahi rakam bachati he
 
 
 The comments ek or udhaaharan dekhte hai
 
 
 Another thing to remember is that if you are paying more than Rs 1,00,000 per year (ie Rs 8,333 per month), then the PAN number of the landlord (irrespective of the mother or father or wife) is to be entered

 so, yaad rahe, makaan kiraaya bhatte par iskar chhot paane ke liye zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or bhugtan kii raseeden maujuud hon
 
 
 One has to first understand who are entitled to income tax exemption on house rent allowance
 
 
 iske liye sabase zaruri baat yah he ki aapako tankhwaah main makaan kiraaya bhatta miltaa ho, or jis makaan kaa kiraaya aap adaa karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai, vah aap hi ke naam nahin honi chahie
 
 
 In fact, under section 10 (13A) of the Income Tax Act, any salaried person has to deduct 50 per cent of his basic salary, the amount received under the head of HRA or 10 per cent of the basic salary from the actual rent paid in the remaining three sums
 The lowest amount is exempt from income tax
 
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi kisi vyakti ko 25,000 rupee mul vetan ke rup main praapt hote hai, or 12,500 rupee echaare ke mad main, or vah 12,500 rupee hi vastav main kiraaya detaa he, to use 10,000 rupee par hi chhot mil paaegi
 
 
 In fact, this amount is saved by deducting 10 per cent (2,500) of the basic salary from the paid rent (12,500)
 
 
 tippaniyan Let us see another example
 
 
 ek or yaad rakhane laayak baat yah he ki agar aap salanaa 1,00,000 rupee (yani 8,333 rupee pratimah) se zyaada kiraaya de rahe hai, to makaan-maalik (bhale hi ve maa yaa pita yaa patni hon) kaa pan number darj kiya janaa bhi anivaary he, or unhen is aamadani par tex dena hoga
 
 
 So remember, to get income tax exemption on house rent allowance, it is necessary that the house renter's property is not there, and payment receipts are present
