 kehane ko modi sarkaar bhartiya raajnneeti funding main paardarshita laane ke uddeshy se elactoral bond yojana laai
 Is the government turning this plan on its own so that the opposing parties do not get the benefit of it
 congress ne is maamle main sarkaar par durbhaavna se kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In fact, of the 11 centers created for the sale of electoral bonds to fund political parties, 7 were opened in the capitals of bjp-ruled states under the Modi government's much-publicized electoral funding reforms
 is saal april main jo saat nae centre khole gaye unamem se 6 bijepi shasit rajyon main hai
 The names of parties benefiting from donations under the new scheme cannot be made public
 endie sarkaar ne is saal janvari memelactoral bondyojna ko adhishuchet kiya tha
 In the first phase, branches of State Bank of India were authorized to sell electoral bonds
 ye bond ek hajaar, das hajaar, ek lakh, das lakh or ek karod rupye ke mulyon main chaar mahanagaron- dilli, mumbai, chennai or kolkata main bikri ke liye march main uplabdh karaae gaye
 The second phase opened seven new centers in April
 inamen se chah bijepi shasit rajyon kii rajdhaniyon yani gandhinagar, lakhanu, jaipur, chandigarh, bhopal or guwahati main khole gaye
 Just before the Karnataka assembly elections, the center was opened in Bengaluru from where bonds worth Rs 38 crore were sold only in the month of May
 bengaluru main april or may main kul 51
 Bonds worth 8 crores sold
 vipaksh kaa sawaal he ki elactoral bond kii bikri ke liye centre kholane main hyderabad, tiruvanantpuram, patna or bhubaneshwar kii andekhi kyon kii gai
 The sale of bonds was not allowed in non-bjp ruled states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha
 in sabhi rajyon main kshetreey dalon kii sarkarein hai
 Even in Bihar, no branch was authorized
 yahaan jediu-bijepi gathbandhan sarkaar main jediu senior partner he
 Electoral bonds can be purchased on their own at the authorized branch of State Bank
 vipaksh ne ye andeshaa bhi jataayaa he ki chunavi saal main sarkaar tay kar sakati he ki koun koun se shaharon main bond biken
 The main opposition party Congress alleges that the Modi government is turning the plan on its own so that others do not benefit
 congress sanchaar vibhaag ke prabharee randeep surajevaala ne india today tivi se kaha, “kyon andhra pradesh jaise gaiyr bijepi shasit rajyon main centre nahin khole ja rahe
 The problem is clear
 ham maang karte hai ki har chanda dene vaale kaa naam saarvajanik kiya jaae
 
 
 
 sirf aisa karke hi aage badha ja saktaa he
 According to information received from RTI, the highest (rs 213 crore) electrical bonds were sold from Mumbai in the first three months
 mumbai desh kii vanijyik rajdhani hone ke saath yahaan sabase adhik corporate kaa base he
 The sale of electoral bonds in other cities continued in this way- Delhi (73
 6 karod), kolkata (70 karod), bengalooru (51
 8 crores), Chennai (18 crores) and Gandhinagar (12 crores)
 bengaluru main 51
 38 out of 8 crores
 9 karod sirf may ke chunaav vaale maheene main hi aayaa
 Of the seven cities where the scheme was launched in April, only Bangalore and Gandhinagar bought bonds
 baaki 5 anya rajdhaniyon main ek bhi bond nahin bika
 520 bonds worth Rs 222 crore were sold in March alone to avail tax benefits
 april main 114
 256 bonds worth 9 crore were sold
 may main 101
 204 bonds worth 4 crores sold
 2016-17 main electorol treston se raajnneetik dalon ko jo kul chanda mila unamem se bijepi ko akele 89

 In the Budget of February 2017, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley proposed that any political party can get a maximum donation of Rs 2000 in cash
 partiyaan elactoral bond ke alaava digital or check se bhi chanda hasil kar sakati hai
 But corporates can choose the electoral bond scheme to keep their name a secret
 elactoral bond se kis party ko chande kaa laabh mila, ab ye pahchaan chuphi rahegi
 According to BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Mittal, the government's intention is clear and honest
 mittal ne kaha, “bond bank se kahin bhi kharide ja sakate hai
 One can buy bonds from checks from any authorized branch
 balanceshit main chanda dene vaala bonds ke mulya ko dikhayega lekin ye kise diya gaya ye gupt rahegaa
 Because it is legitimate money, it is childish to accuse it
 ”modi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki elactoral bond yojana ko raajnneetik funding ko paardarshee banane ke liye laayaa gaya he
 According to the government, the scheme aims to eliminate uncontrolled political funding in which a major portion of black money goes into the electoral process
 jaankaar ise gupt agenda maan rahe hai
 They allege that the scheme is not transparent
 sattarudh party aasaani se pataa laga sakati he ki kis chanda dene vaale ne kis raajnneetik dal ko chanda diya he
 Professor Jagdeep Chhokar, the founding member of the Association for Democratic Reforms, told India Today - "the whole scheme has been brought with a special purpose so that corporates can donate to political parties with complete secrecy
" kisi kii bhi jaankaree main ye naa aae or saath hi virdohi partiyon ko chande ke taur par paise ke pravaah ko baandha ja sake
 These are the two possible objectives of the scheme and both are fulfilled by it
 ”elactoral bond kii bikri ke data se saaf hota he ki chote mulya vaale bond kii adhik maang nahin he
 99
 7 fisadi bond das lakh yaa ek karod ke mulyon main kharide gaye hai
 This shows that only Dhankuber is donating to political parties

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has described the achievements of the Narendra Modi government as negligible, saying that in the last three years, the central government has not done any work but has only talked big things
 basapa kii ore se jari mayawati ke bayaan main modi sarkaar par teen saal kii uplabdhiyon ko sarkari vigyapanon ke jariye prachaarit karne ke liye janata kaa paisa pani kii tarah bahaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 He said that in the last three years, the anti-dalit and minority policies of the Modi government have not only affected the social harmony in the country badly, but due to wrong economic policies, the gap between rich and poor has increased even more
 
 tippaniyan Mayawati said that after assessing the three years of functioning of the central government, it is clear that the weaker and downtrodden sections of the society are trapped in the vicious circle of poverty while the rich people are becoming increasingly wealthy
 unhone kaha ki desh bhar main lagaataar badhati manhagaai, berogari or jaateey evam sampradayik hinsa modi sarkaar ke desh badalane ke daavon kii hakeekat ko spasht karne ke liye kaaphi he
 He said that to hide the plight of farmers, laborers, Dalits and minorities, the government is resorting to government advertisements to prove the big claims of development to be true
 iske liye sarkaar ne vigyapanon par akut dhan kharch karne kii niti apanaayi he
 Mayawati said that in the last three years, the Modi government has benefited only the capitalists all over the world
 mayawati ne kaha ki ‘‘goraksha ke naam par nirdosh daliton or alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf bhagava brigade kaa updrav or aatank modi sarkaar kii hi dein he
 Due to this, the expectation of justice in the public is constantly falling, which is a dangerous sign for a better future in the interest of the country
 ’’ Mayawati's statement issued by BSP has also accused the Modi government of using public money as a pretext to publicize the achievements of three years through government advertisements
 unhone kaha ki beete teen saalon main modi sarkaar kii dalit or alpsankhyak virdohi nitiyon ke kaaran na sirf desh main saamaajik samarasata kaa tanabana buree tarah se prabhavit hua he balki galat aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran amir or garib ke bich kii khai or bhi zyada bad gai he
 The comments mayawati ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar ke teen saal ke kaamkaaj kaa akalan karne par saaf mahasoos hota he ki samaaj ke kamjor or dalit tabake ke log garibi ke dushchakra main funs gaye hai jabaki amir varg ke log lagaataar dhanadya hote ja rahe hai
 He said that the ever-increasing inflation, unemployment and ethnic and communal violence across the country is enough to clarify the reality of the Modi government's claims of changing the country
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kisaan, majdoor, dalit or alpsankhyakon kii badahaali ko chupaane ke liye vikaas ke bade bade daavon ko sach sabit karne ke liye sarkari vigyapanon kaa sahaara le rahi he
 For this, the government has adopted a policy of spending a lot of money on advertisements
 mayawati ne kaha ki pichley teen saalon main modi sarkaar ne sirf mumahamedha bhar puunjipatiyon ko hi laabh pahunchaaya he
 Mayawati said that "the furore and terror of the saffron brigade against innocent Dalits and minorities in the name of cow protection is the responsibility of the Modi government"
 isse jansamanya main nyaay kii ummid lagaataar ghat rahi he jo desh hit ke lihaaj se behatar bhavishya ke liye khatarnaak sanket he

 Reacting to what was said in the first interview given by PM Narendra Modi in the new year, Mayawati said in a statement, "BJP is still assuming that the arrogance of its majority is just and right in every way and by it People are happy and cheering on every decision taken
 use lag rahaa he ki madhyapradesh or rajasthan main bhaajapa kii sarkaar chali gai he to kya hua, vot pratishat ke maamle main bhaajapa vastav main congress ke lagbhag baraabar hi rahi he
 Mayawati said that such stubborn and anti-people thinking of the top leadership of the BJP proves that her arrogance is still intact, which will go only after the crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 basapa pramukh ne kaha ''rajg se dhire-dhire karke saare pramukh ghatak dalon ke alag ho jane ke baad, shesh rah gaye dal inke sankeern va ahamkaari ravaiye se duhkhi hai
 Mayawati said that the return of black money such as gross electoral promise and disbursement of 15 to 20 lakh rupees to the poor, along with the burning problem of poverty, inflation, unemployment as well as the bjp's narrow and in cases of mob violence, Ayodhya and cow protection etc
 The wrong attitude still hasn't changed
 (input bhashaa se) Despite the rise in consumer and wholesale inflation rates in recent weeks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday did not make any changes in the main policy rates as part of an effort to not allow growth to fall further

 He said, but can the central and state governments take more steps to reduce food prices? This will improve the overall inflation environment
 buudhvaar ko rigerv bank kii maudrik niti kii taaja samiksha ke baad : - Repo rate 7

 Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks take short-term loans from the Reserve Bank

 isi silsile main pashchim bengal main congress or sipiem ke bich ranneetik samjhauta tay hota dikhaa rahaa he
 To prevent the division of angry votes from the ruling TMC in the state and the ruling BJP at the center, the CPM is believed to not field its candidates in all 42 seats in Bengal
 pichley kuch samay se rajya kii congress or sipiem ikai is samjhaute kii pairvi karti rahi hai
 According to a report published in an English newspaper, the agreement with Congress was discussed in the CPM Politburo meeting held on Friday and Saturday in Kolkata
 to vahiin rashtriya rajdhani dilli main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne sabhi pradesh adhyakshon or vidhayak dal ke netaaon ke saath baithak kii
 After this meeting, Bengal Congress President Somen Mitra said that the party wants to compromise with the Left without sacrificing its dignity
 ab tak congress ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke samjhaute kaa virodh karti rahi sipiem kii kerala ikai ke rukh main bhi narmi ai he
 Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, secretary of cpm's Kerala unit, said that if the BJP is to be ousted from power in the next Lok Sabha election, all strategic steps will have to be taken
 congress ne bhi bhi is tareeke ke ghoshnaa spasht taur par kar chuki he
 He said that in April 2018, the Congress and the CPM Polit Bureau had decided that defeating the BJP and its allies was the main goal, but the Polit Bureau had also decided that it would be without any political alliances with the Congress
 haalanki party ne pashchim bengal ke liye vikalp khule rakhe the, iske peeche yah tark diya gaya ki gaiyr-bijepi, gaiyr-tiemasi voton ko zyada se zyada ekajute kiya jaae

 Therefore, the Bengal unit will send its proposal on this issue with consultations from all sides
 jis par agle maheene hone vaali central cameti kii baithak main nirnay liya jayega
 The agreement reached in the assembly elections is a fact that a similar agreement was reached between the Congress and the CPM in the 2016 assembly elections in which the two parties did not share the stage together
 is chunaav kaa nateeja apekshaakrit vaisaa nahin rahaa jitna congress or sipiem ko ummid thi

 lekin party kii pradesh ikai lagaataar congress adhyaksh ko is baat se avgat karaati rahi ki kis tarah tiemasi rajya main party ko kamjor kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Mamta Banerjee has already said that the state Congress leaders do not matter to her as the party's national leadership has been a fan of tmc's role of uniting opposition parties
 pashchim bengal main pichley kuch saalon main bijepi ke graph main jabardast oochaal aayaa he or janamanas main party khud ko mukhya vipakshi dal ke taur par sabit karne main kaamyaab bhi rahi he
 Therefore, this election in Bengal was supposed to be BJP vs TMC
 lekin agar congress-sipiem ke bich samjhauta ho jaataa he to muqabla trikoniya ho saktaa he

 The Narendra Modi government did not waste any time in describing it as India's major diplomatic victory and termed it the third successful surgical strike on Pakistan after the September 2016 surgical strike and then the Balakot air strike in February this year
 pradhanmantri modi ne 3 may ko rajasthan main ek chunavi raily main kaha, “yah aatankwaadi ab pakistan sarkaar kii mehmaannawaaji kaa anand nahin le sakegaa
 This is our third strike
 pakistan kaa ghamand chur-chur ho gaya he
 "the inclusion of Azhar in the list of terrorists is certainly a major diplomatic victory for the Modi government
" phir bhi jiskaa naam pehle prayaas main aatankwaadiyon kii fehrist main shaamil ho janaa chahie tha, uske liye chaar baar prayaas karnaa padaa or nau saal tak china ke saath kathin saudebaaji kerani padi or antat america dabaav or sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke prayaason se nirmit ek abhootpurv rajanyik gathbandhan se aisa sambhav ho sakaa
 The BJP hopes that it will benefit from this success in the Security Council in the remaining stages of the Lok Sabha elections

 This campaign to boycott Chinese goods will never succeed and should not be a surprise
 jaisaa ki november 2016 main bhi isi tarah kaa prayaas hua tha, jab bhartiya vyapaar sanghon ne diwali ke dauraan ek rashtravyapee bahishkaar kaa aahvaan kiya tha

 se adhik) tak pahunch chukaa he jo ki adhikansh bhartiya aapurti shrunkhalaaon kaa pramukh ghatak ban gaya he
 It is one thing to burn cheap Chinese toys, it is a different thing to ban this import

 However, now there has also been an increase in salaries and the prices of pharma products have gone up

 However, they have not had much impact on exports from China to India
 bhaskar kehete hai, “bhartiya companiyon ne doguni keemton par bhi utpaadon kaa aayaat jari rakhaa he
 “india missed out on increasing domestic production of apis after a focus on more profitable formulations (drug prescriptions) in the mid-1990s, and its revival does not appear to be imminent
 bharat ke vikalpupabhokta vastuon main se smartphone china ke rajasav main sabase mahatvapurn yogadan dete hai
 Indian consumers are spending a lot on Chinese smartphones and cheap phones there too
 oppo, vivo, shiomi or huavei jaise chini smartphone brands bharat ke paanch sarvshereshth phone vikritaon main hai
 Some smartphones, Xiaomi and Vivo are being assembled in India and are expected to be manufactured in the hands of Indian workers in the future
 bharat ke liye vikalp kahaan batch jate hai? kuch visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki china jis vishaal vyapaar adhishesh kaa laabh uthaata he, bharat ke liye vahaan kuch sambhaavna dikhti he
 But a close analysis of India's trade relations makes it clear that the penetration of Chinese equipment into various supply chains has become such that there is no immediate alternative to it

 a boycott of Chinese goods could lead to a decrease in the market of many important products such as electronic goods
 dabaav ranneeti ke rup main, yah kaam nahin kar saktaa kyonki bharat china ke liye apekshaakrit chota bazaar he
 In 2017, only 3 percent of exports of goods made in China came to India markets
 iske alaava bharat mobile phone sahit chini sanchaar upkarnon kaa chatha sabase bada bazaar (2017 main maatr 4 pratishat hissaa) tha
 Says Dhar, "of course if the trade war started by the Trump administration hit China so strongly that it had to look for alternative markets, then maybe the situation could change

 china ke paas swatantra choti privet companiyaan nahin hai, yahaan tak ki alibaba or huavei jaisi badi bahurashtriya companiyon ke bhi chini sarkaar se gahare sambandh hai
 Instead of seeing economic relations as a means of political gain, they should expand on the basis of their merits

 And the biggest thing is that for India to economically divert an economy five times bigger than itself, it would mean that we stand in a position to reduce economic disparity with China, because without all the other options, China's attitude Will be in a position to influence only marginally
 vyapaarik vikalpbharat ekmaatr aisa desh nahin he jo khud ko aisi duvidha kii sthiti main paata he jisamen ek taraf use jahaan china se rajnatik kathinaaiyon se jujhane kii chunauti he, vahiin aarthik rup se bhi china ke saath sambandh banaae rakhane kii vivashtaa he

 china main bharat ke purv rajdoot ashok kanth china-japan sambandhon kaa udhaaharan dete hai, jahaan gahari pratidwandvita or aitihaasik dushmani ke baavjood donon deshon ne ek bahut badi paraspar aarthik nirbharta viksit kii he
 Japanese technology and investments have boosted China's economy while China's market has become the most important for many Japanese companies
 ve kehete hai, “agar aap china-japan ke udhaaharan par vichaar karen to donon ke bich 2015 ke baad sambandhon main jo sthirataa ai he, uske peeche bada kaaran yah he ki donon deshon ne aisa mahasoos kiya ki unhen aarthik rup se ek-duusare kii badi aavashyaktaa he
 This acted as a constant factor

 It was with this hope that the need for each other would reduce the possibility of mutual conflict, but broadly speaking, this bet is working in terms of China, in spite of the economic concerns China has with India right now
 Is, it is nothing compared to her intimately connected East Asian neighbors
 haalanki vah japan or dakshin korea kaa udhaaharan dekar iske ek anya pahalu kii ore bhi dhyaan aakrisht karaate hai
 When it comes to dealing with the totalitarian government of China, they can be used to mobilize private services along with state services to punish countries
 japan or dakshin korea ne bhi aarthik sambandhon se sthirataa kii sthiti banaai thi, lekin china manmarjee se uskaa ulanghan karata rahata he
 In 2012, anti-japan demonstrations that also had the government's covert support saw the mob vandalize Japanese car showrooms and some Japanese auto companies temporarily withdrew their workers from factories

 kaant kehete hai, “ham aisa hukum nahin suna sakate ki falaan cheez kharido or falaan cheez khareednaa band kar do
 The Indian government can take some steps to encourage or discourage trade and try to influence the trade, but we cannot order companies
 ”china kaa muqabalaidi vyapaar ke morche par bharat ke saamne khadi chunautiyon kii baat kii jaae to kuch chuninda upaay hi hai jo bharat kar saktaa he
 Arvind Virmani, India's former chief economic adviser and president of the Foundation for Economic Growth and Welfare, says the best options facing India are to erect non-tariff barriers of the same kind as "china often opposes its exports and its policies Has been standing to punish the doing countries
 ”software or telecom kshetra kii ore ishaara karte hue ve kehete hai, ‘‘non tarriff barier kaa focus un kshetron par rakhaa janaa chahie jo bharat or sabhi swatantra, khule loktantric samaaj ke liye sambhavit dirghakaalik khatra paidaa karte hai
 The main objective of such a policy should be to convey to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party that India is not going to succumb to China's efforts to halt or slow down its development
 ” ve kehete hai ki iske liye bharat ko thode samay ke liye pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karne ko taiyaar bhi rahanaa hoga
 India may also consider selective measures to show China that it should decide whether to continue India's trade relations or not
 kaant kehete hai, “udhaaharan ke liye ham chini companiyon ko do took yah kah sakate hai ki unhen chunanaa hoga ki ve pioke main vyapaar karne main (kuch companiyaan china-pakistan aarthik galiyare ke liye kaam kar rahi hai) ruchi rakhti hai yaa phir bhartiya bazaar main

 ” yani ki ek hi rasta bachataa he—mahatvapurn kshetron main menuphaccharing kshamta ko teji se badhaayaa jaae
 Long-term challenge However, the biggest companies responsible for increasing continued dependence on China (eg telecom sector companies) have also imported equipment that are currently under surveillance in some Western countries
 viramani kehete hai, ‘‘hameshaa kii tarah vyapaar alp avadhi main sabase saste vikalp kii ore dekhtaa he
 But if the long-term benefit of reducing excessive dependence on Chinese telecommunications equipment is recognized, economical policies to reduce it can be formulated
 ’’vastav main, china se vyapaarik sambandhon kii sanrachana ko badalane se lekar gharelu menuphaccharing ko badhaava dene ke liye upyukt nitiyaan banane tak, bharat ke liye kai morchon par badi chunauti dikhti he
 Their failure will encourage companies to import their solar panels and telecommunications equipment from Shenzhen and Guangzhou
 kanth kehete hai, “yah aisa kshetra he jahaan hamen dirghakaalik ranneeti kii aavashyaktaa he
 If you consider API imports, this level of dependency is certainly not desirable and we need to get out of this situation with a country that has an old track record of using its economic dominance to create pressure

 agar bharat beijing par dabaav banane ke liye aarthik upayon ko chunata he to use bhi china se milte-julate javaabon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 Beijing could cripple India's economy by blocking exports of apis and rare earths
 china kaa khaskar bharat se alag hone kaa prayaas dablutio niyamon kaa ulanghan hoga, haalanki china niyamon kaa paalan kare, isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 China has informally stopped exports in the past to pressure many countries
 sach to yah he ki china par apni mahatvapurn nirbharta ko kam karne ke liye yaa us nirbharta ke moolyankan kii prakriya shuru karne or pataa lagane ke liye ki kis samvedansheel kshetra main vikalp talashne kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he, ab tak kuch khaas nahin kiya gaya he
 Officials say that unless this is done, the use of economic and business measures as a means of creating pressure cannot be thought of

 Today, family members are finding it difficult to run their family

 Even if we had to go to jail for this, we will not back down
 sarkaar kaa dimag tabhi chalata he jab usapar prahaar hota he
 i request the people of our country that from December 30 to January 1, we will fill the jail

 Once the Vigilance report on Mohalla Clinic comes out, the Delhi government is once again on the target of the opposition
 mohalla clinics main marizon ke aankadon main herapheri or farzivaade ko lekar vipaksh ab yojana par hi sawaal uthaa rahaa he

 kya sarkaar jabardastee is yojana ko kaamyaab dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin is koshish main farjivada saamne aa gaya he
 Tiwari also took a pinch and said that the Aam Aadmi Party government had claimed international acclaim
 kaha tha ki kophi annan ne bhi unki yojana kii tarif kii thi, lekin ab agar kophi annan khud aakar ek baar mohalla clinics kii hakeekat dekh len, to unhen bhi isiu main bhartee karana pade, kyonki mohalla clinics main marizon se khilwaad kiya ja rahaa he
 Tiwari alleged that a major scam is going on in the name of treating patients in Mohalla clinics
 gadabadi kar sarkaar ke kareebi log apni jeben bhar rahe hai, aarthik ghapale ho rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari has demanded that the Mohalla Clinic Scheme should be investigated by CBI
 ab jabaki gadabadiyaan khud sarkaar kii hi report main saamne aa rahi hai, to ye kisi bade ghotaale kaa sanket hai, isliye sarkaar ko marizon kii jaan se khilwaad band karnaa chahie or sibiai se is puri gadabadi kii jaanch karaayi jaani chahie
 Tiwari said that the Aam Aadmi Party has made Mohalla Clinic its business
 kaaryakartaaon ke makaanon ko mohalla clinics dikhaakar paanch guna kiraaya vasula ja rahaa he or marizon ke naam par sarkari khazaane ko lutaa ja rahaa he

 He said that he is being abused by the people of the party (congress) but he is also silent on this
 siddhu ne shahari vikaas mantralay ke kaamkaaj kaa byora diya or kaha ki siem jo bhi faisla len, unki marji, ve apane vibhaag kii report jari karenge
 a recent statement by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh that he wants to change the portfolio of his cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu as he is not able to handle the local bodies department efficiently, but Navjot Singh Sidhu gave clarification today
 unhone chandigarh main ek press conference main siem amarinder singh ke aaropon par safai di
 Sidhu said that an atmosphere is being created against him
 siddhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) ne kaha ki 'mujh par jo vibhaag ke aarope lagaae gaye unka jawaab de rahaa hum
 He said that the CM accused (amarinder Singh) that no one asked me what they do
 ' siddhu ne kaha ki unke vibhaag ke paas kuch nahin tha, sirf sielue sin kiye gaye hai lekin purv ke do varshon main samay kii pabandi ke saath kaam shuru hue hai
 Be it pine water or smart city, no amount was given under the Amrit scheme

 'siddhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) ne kaha ki yah sab vijan kii vajah se hua he
 It includes all the Buffet cities of Punjab
 unhone kaha ki 'aaj hamaare paas sarplus fund he
 He said that 'when i went to take action on illegitimate buildings, opposed me, i still did not speak
 meraa ek bhi kaam aisa nahin he jisamen transperency na ho
 Whatever they decide (amarinder Singh), i will issue the report of my department
 naharon kaa jo pani shaharon ko dene ja rahe hai, vah kahaan se ho rahaa he? maine puraa yogadan diya he, par ungali kisi par nahin uthaai
 'sidhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) said that' i have not spoken against any Congress worker till date, while he abuses me
 mainen bathinda main stage par jo kaha usamen kisi kaa naam nahin liya, sirf itnaa kaha ki congress kii peeth par jo chura maar rahaa he, usko thok do
 Just said, i do not back down
 bathinda main 40 varsh main dekhen to sabase kam vot se ham har hai
 The son of Captain (amarinder Singh) is also lost from there
 maine captain ke khilaaf kabhi kuch nahin kaha
 First i went for 55 seats in which 53 won but none spoke
 siem sahab ne yah kaha tha ki jo mantri apane kshetra se haarenge un par karrwai hogi
 'sidhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) said that' i have been abused many times but i have never said anything because the power is to speak against the opposition
 'unhone kaha ki 'jo mantri meraa virodh karte hai unke khilaaf kuch nahi kahuunga
 All are my brothers maine tivi par 20 varsh kaam kiya
 Today i stand for Punjab
 department agar badal jaataa he to yah captain (amarinder Singh) kaa faisla hoga
 On Modi's oath, Sidhu said that we have to salute the public's decision

 The day before the election, Sidhu questioned the investigation into the absurdity of religious texts in 2015
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki siddhu ke bayaan se bathinda main party ke pradarshan par asar padaa hoga or chunaav parinaamon ke baad vah party alaakaman se sampark karenge
 The Captain (amarinder Singh) had said in a statement, 'I want to change Sidhu's department as he is not able to handle his department efficiently
 '' mukhyamantri ne kaha ki punjab ke shahari ilaakon main congress kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa or siddhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) shahari vikaas mantri hai
 He said he made a mistake by making controversial statements
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki mantri is baat ko nahin samaj paae ki dharmik granthon kii brudabi ke mudde kii jaanch ke liye vishesh jaanch dal (esaiti) kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Amarinder Singh also said that Sidhu (navjot Singh Sidhu) would not tolerate 'yari and Jhappi' from Pakistan's army chief and especially the army would not tolerate what ISI pro-terrorist targets target

 adhikari ne bataaya ki jila magistrate juher-bin-sagir ne buudhvaar ko vanyajeev vibhaag ko dilli-agra haive par sthit sur sarovar pakshi abhayaarany se sate kalege ko sil karne ko kaha
 District Forest Officer Sujoy Banerjee said, "the DM, acting on the order of the Allahabad High Court, has ordered the college to be closed
 'gauratlab he ki vanyajeev vibhaag ne chah maah purv is kalege ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kar ise sil kar diya tha
 In protest, the college administration appealed to the High Court, but it was rejected by the court only last month
 avaidh bhoomi par bane is college kii tej roshni se abhayaarany ke pakshi kaaphi pareshaan the
 Apart from this, the waste of college hostel is polluting the nearby lake without any treatment
 varsh 2012 main bhi vibhaag ne avaidh nirmaan or pradesh kii sabase badi jhil ko pradooshit karne ke kaaran isaki do imaaraton ko sil kar diya tha
 It is also important that before this 2002 batch Indian Forest Service officer's performance report was outstanding for 14 years and in 2016-17, he has been given outstanding rating
 yani keval ek saal 2015-16 main kharaab reating di gai
 It is worth noting that this year, Chaturvedi also received Raman Magsaysay Award
 chaturveda ne adaalat main kaha ki ye unke moulik adhikaron ke hanan kaa maamla he kyonki apir zero kar dene se unka kariyar khatre main he yani wo kabhi bhi naukari se nikaale ja sakate hai
 Chaturvedi also said that in 2015-16 he was not given any work against which he had appealed to the tribunal
 agar kaam hi nahin tha to parformens report zero kisaliye kii gayi
 When the court questioned Additional Solicitor General Rakesh Thapliyal standing on behalf of the Central Government, he said that Chaturvedi should approach the Tribunal (primary Court of Government Officers) before coming to the High Court
 sarkaar kii maang par hycourt ne bhi supreme court ke ek faisle ko uddhat kiya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki yachikakarta ko hycourt main sidhe nahin aana chaiye
 Chaturvedi argued against this saying that the same court (uttarakhand High Court) has not only heard in hundreds of such cases but has also given verdicts
 ek maamla rajya ke pramoti van seva afasar ashok kumaar gupta kaa he
 This officer requested the High Court to stop his promotion so that he had stayed in the same post which he has held for the last 6 years
 chaturvedi ne adaalat se kaha ki eesg rakesh thapalial - jo chaturvedi se pehle tribunel jane ko kah rahe hai – gupta ke maamle main vakil rah chuke hai lekin abhi unke cese main bilkul vipareet daleel de rahe hai
 Despite this argument, the court asked Chaturvedi to go to the tribunal first and return to the High Court if he does not get relief there
 chaturvedi kii daleel par court ne kaha, “yachikakarta kaa cese is baat par nahin mana ja saktaa ki court ne pehle is tarah ke maamalon main dakhal diya he
 In this case, the opposing party immediately objected
 kisi duusari rit pitishan par kisi trutipurna tareeke se sunwaayee hui he to isse yachikakarta ko ye phayda nahin mil jaataa ki ham supreme court kii ore se tay kiye gaye niyam kaayadon ko na maane
 " adaalat ne apane faisle main mana he ki yachikakarta (sanjeev chaturvedi) kaa ye kahana sahi he ki keval vaikalpik upaay (tribunel main jane kaa vikalp) hona anuchhed 226 / 227 ke tahat adaalat (hycourt) ko is maamle main sunwaayee ke adhikaar se vanchit nahin karata
 The constitution has given rights
 hycourt ne apane faisle main kaha ki agar moulik adhikaar khatre main hon to aise adaalat dakhal de sakati he lekin supreme court ke el chandra kumaar cese main die faisle kaa zikr karte huye ye bhi kaha ki ye niyam us cese main lagu hona zaruri nahin he jahaan maamla administrative tribunel act ke antargat aata ho (jaise chaturvedi ke cese main he) 
 In its judgment, the court said on the basis of a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1997, "the petitioner should go to the tribunal under the Administrative Tribunal Act
 ham ye yachikakarta par chhodte hai ki vah apane saare adhikaron kaa vahaan istemaal kare
 If their petition in the tribunal is rejected on the ground that they do not have legal rights, then we keep open the way for the petitioner to come back to this court
 ”tippaniyan Even after giving the verdict in Chaturvedi's case, the bench of Justice Joseph has accepted many other petitions
 isamen se ek maamle main to yachikarta ke paksh main faisla bhi sunaaya gaya he
 Law experts are calling this a surprising situation
 supreme court ke vakil sudarshan goyal kaa kahana he, “is tarah kaa aadesh hairaan - pareshaan karne vaala he
 This becomes more important because the government has tortured Chaturvedi for a long time and Sanjeev Chaturvedi has accused Union Minister JP Nadda in this case
 yahi bench pehle is tarah ke saikadon cese sun chuki he or unamem se kai main yachikakarta ke paksh main faisle bhi die hai
 Here Chaturvedi is not mistaken by the court yet asks him to go to the tribunal instead of giving relief
 hamen pataa chalaa he ki kuch din baad adaalat phir se aise hi maamalon ko na keval sunwaayee ke liye sweekaar kar rahi he balki un par yachikakarta ke paksh main faisla bhi suna rahi he
 " adaalat ne jab is bare main centre sarkaar kii ore se khadey edisnal solisitor general rakesh thapalial se sawaal kiya to unhone kaha ki chaturvedi ko hycourt main aane se pehle tribunel (sarkari afasaron kii praathmik adaalat) main guhaar karnaa chaiye
 On the demand of the government, the High Court also cited a decision of the Supreme Court stating that the petitioner should not come directly to the High Court
 chaturvedi ne iske khilaaf daleel dete hue kaha ki yahi adaalat (uttarakhand hycourt) is tarah ke saikadon maamalon main na keval sunwaayee kar chuki he balki faisle bhi die hai
 One case is of the state's Promotional Forest Service Officer Ashok Kumar Gupta
 is afasar ne apni padonnati ko rokane ke liye hycourt se guhaar lagaai taaki vah usee pad par rah chuke jis par pichley 6 saalon se he
 Chaturvedi told the court that ASG Rakesh Thapliyal - who is asking Chaturvedi to go to the tribunal before - had been a lawyer in Gupta's case but is now arguing the exact opposite in his case
 is tark ke baavjood adaalat ne chaturvedi se kaha ki vah pehle tribunel jaaen or agar vahaan unhen raahat nahin milti ko hycourt waapas aa sakate hai
 On Chaturvedi's plea, the court said, "the case of the petitioner cannot be considered that the court has interfered in such cases before
" is maamle main virdohi paksh (rapondent) ne turant aapatti kii he
 If any other writ petition has been heard in a flawed manner, then it does not benefit the petitioner that we should not follow the rules and regulations set by the Supreme Court
 ” The court has held in its judgment that the petitioner (sanjeev Chaturvedi) is right to say that there is only alternative remedy (option to go to tribunal) under Article 226 / 227, the court (high Court) is not deprived of the right to hear in this case
 Would do samvidhan ne adhikaar diye huye hai
 The High Court said in its judgment that if the fundamental rights are in danger then such courts can interfere, but referring to the judgment in the l Chandra Kumar case of the Supreme Court, it also said that these rules are not necessary in that case where The case falls under the Administrative Tribunal Act (as in Chaturvedi's case)
 apane faisle main adaalat ne supreme court ke 1997 main sunaae ek faisle ke aadhaar par kaha, “yachikakarta ko administrative tribunel act ke tahat tribunel janaa chahie
 We leave it to the petitioner to exercise all his rights there
 agar tribunel main unki yachika is aadhaar par khaarij ho jaye ki unka kanoonee adhikaar nahin he to ham yachikakarta ke is adaalat main waapas aane kaa rasta khulaa rakhte hai 
 "comments chaturvedi ke maamle main faisla dene ke baad bhi justise joseph kii bench ne hi kai duusari yachikaayen manzur kii he
 In one of these cases, a verdict has also been given in favor of the petitioner

 Supreme Court lawyer Sudarshan Goyal says, "such an order is shocking - disturbing
" yah adhik mahatvapurn isaliye ho jaataa he kyonki sarkaar ne chaturvedi ko lambey samay se pratadit kiya he or is maamle main sanjeev chaturvedi ne kendriya mantri je pi nadda ko aaropee banaaya he
 This bench has heard hundreds of such cases before and has given decisions in favor of the petitioner in many of them
 yahaan chaturvedi ko court galat nahin maan rahi phir bhi unhen raahat dene ke bajaay tribunel jane ko kahati he
 We have come to know that after a few days, the court is again not only accepting such cases for hearing but is also ruling on them in favor of the petitioner

 On August 12, 1990, 14-year-old tennis player Ruchika was sexually assaulted by Rathore, the then Inspector General of Police of Haryana and president of Haryana Lawn Tennis Association
 usne 1993 main aatmahatya kar lee
 Rathore and his lawyer wife Abha Rathore were present in the court while delivering the verdict
 ruchika ke ek dost kii maa madhu prakaash ne 1997 main punjab or haryana ucch nyaayalay main jaakar ghatana ke maamle main jaanch kii maang kii thi
 a police report stated that prima facie there is a case against Rathore
 baad main 1998 main maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di gayi or sunwaayee patiala kii ek adaalat main kii gayi
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court transferred the case to the CBI Special Judge here
 adaalat ne din pratidin sunwaayee karne kaa or ek maheene ke bheetar ise puri karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Madhu told reporters outside the court, "I am happy that Rathore has been sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment but at the same time i am sad that it took so much time for the court to pronounce the case
" yadi rathore ke khilaaf faisla pehle suna diya jaataa to meraa maananaa he ki ruchika aatmahatya nahin karti
 "madhu's husband and retired Haryana government employee Anand Prakash said," i believe the punishment is less
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘maamle ko itane lambey samay tak khinchne main rathore kii bhoomika rahi
 i will continue to fight against the police officers and bureaucrats who helped Rathore during the trial to cover the case

 Kangana Ranaut is not called Queen of Bollywood
 is baat ko film "jajmental he kya" ke trailor ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya he
 Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao's acting powerful punch are seen in the trailer
 yah film 26 july ko relies ho rahi he
 After watching the trailer, there is a tremendous response on social media
 film ko darshak abhi se superhit qaraar de rahe hai
 But the film is in the news because of its content, it matters as much for Kangana as well
 kangana ranut ke kariyar kaa graph dekhen to unhen kisi aisi film kii darkaar nahin he jo unke kariyar ko sambhaal sake
 Kangana is already included in the list of top most actresses of the industry
 ab tak ke kariyar main unhone kai superhit solo filmein di hai
 There are many memorable characters
 lekin film jajmental he kya unke kariyar ko ek nae mukaam par le jane ke liye taiyaar he
 Actually, there are many variations in Kangana's character in the trailer
 kangana ke expressant, doylaag delivery ko dekhakar ye kahana galat nahin he ki industry se bade-bade sitaron kii kangana jald hi chuttee karne vaali hai
 The film is releasing on July 26 this month
 relies se pehle film ko lekar kai vivaad saamne aae, ye bhi kaha gaya ki kangana kaa mekars se aapasi vivaad ho gaya he
 There was also a dispute about the title of the film, and finally came up with Mental Hai Kya, Judicial Hai Kya
 kisi bhi film ke saath kitne hi vivaad kyon na jud jaaen, aakhir main sabase zyada myne rakhti he uski report
 Judgment is what a suspense thriller, Murder Mystery
 film main kangana or rajkumaar ke kirdaar main nayaapan saafe najar aa rahaa he
 All these factors are enough to give the film a great entry in the box office
 agar baat sirf kangana ranut kii karen to unki adaakaari kii chamak kai filmon main najar ai he
 They include characters portrayed in many films like Fashion, Queen, Toon Weds Manu, Rangoon
 lekin kangana kaa jajmental he kya main nibhaayaa gaya bobi kaa role in sabase alag he or jabardast he
 Kangana has challenged Bollywood on the open stage many times
 unki bebaaki ke log pehle hi kaayal hai lekin adaakaar ke liye uske hunar kaa parde par bolnaa bahut jaruri he
 Kangana has also achieved this feat
 ek baargi maan bhi len ki jajmental he kya box offis par jalwe na bikhere
 But it is certain that Kangana's character Bobby will be remembered in this film for a long time
 aath maheene se gumshuda ek mahila apane ghar waapas pahunchi he, lekin uskaa pati uski hatya ke aarope main jail main band he
 The story of 'death to life' of this woman named Anita is very interesting
 pehle maut kii kahani jaanate hai
 Anita, a resident of Nalanda district of Bihar, went to Gujarat in June last year in search of work with her husband Ravindra
 ahmedabad stesan par vah apane pati se bichad gai
 Anita was not educated, nor did she know any language other than Magahi
 lihaaza vah kisi ko samajha nahin pai ki vah koun he or uske saath kya hua he
 Considering it to be unclaimed, the local police sent her to the Odhav Nari Protection Home in Ahmedabad
 duusari ore pati bhi anitha ke na milane par waapas gaanv aa gaya
 When Anita's father did not see the daughter, he was furious at Ravindra
 unhone rabindra par anitha kii hatya kaa aarope lagate hue exiaar darj karawa di
 Due to Anita's absence, the police arrested Ravindra and sent him to jail
 anitha bhi apni maut kii khabar se bekhbar ahmedabad ke nari sangrakshan grih main padi rahi
 Last month, the responsibility of the Women's Protection Home was handed over from the state's Social Welfare Department to the Women and Child Development Department
 is vibhaag ne mustaidi dikhaai
 They thought that this woman could be sent home
 chah maheene se sangrakshan grih main padi anitha se baatcheet shuru hui
 She could not understand her point
 phir vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko laga ki ho na ho is ladki kii bhashaa bihar kii taraf kii lagati he
 Then people who knew the language of Bihar were questioned
 tab jaakar pataa chalaa ki ladki ke gaanv kaa naam gopalbag he
 At first it seemed that the matter is in Gopalganj district of Bihar, but nothing was gained from the investigation there
 zyada baatcheet karne par anitha ne bataaya ki uske gaanv ke paas bada shahar nalanda he
 It became clear that the district is Nalanda
 vahaan internet se gaanv kaa naam pataa karne par pataa chalaa ki yah nalanda ke sarmera police thane main padataa he
 Talks with local police started
 police ne kah diya ki is gaanv main aisa koi nahin he
 Then the police brought the father after revealing his father's name
 vibhaag ke adhikariyon ne baatcheet kii, to ve chaunk gaye, kyonki unhone bataaya gaya ki unki beti kii to maut ho chuki he or ve uskaa kriyakarm bhi kar chuke hai
 After a little emphasis, he agreed to talk to the girl
 baatcheet kiya to ladki ne apana naam anitha bataaya, is par pita ne bataaya ki unki beti kaa naam anitha nahin tha
 Then Anita told her the name of the house, then after going somewhere the father felt that it was probably his daughter
 pita or parivaar anitha se milane ahmedabad aae or use dekhne par puraa yakeen hua ki vah unheen kii beti he
 Now the family has returned to their home after taking their deceased daughter alive
 lekin pati rabindra abhi bhi jail main he, kyonki kaagazi karrwai ke baad hi kanoon anitha ko jinda maanegaa or rabindra jail se chhot paaegaa
 At the moment, there is a happy ending to this interesting story
 bhartiya spinner amit mishra ne pehle test main bhale hi zyada wicket nahin chatkaaye hon, lekin is leg spinner ne kaha ki unhone ek chor se westeindies ke ballebaajon par dabaav banaakar apni bhoomika acchhee tarah nibhaai
 Significantly, in the Antiga Test, r Ashwin had decided the historic victory of Team India against West Indies by taking 7 wickets in the second innings
 is match main bharat ne pari or 92 ran se badi jeet darj kar siries main 1-0 se badhat bana lee
 Mishra took two wickets in the first innings, while in the second innings he could get only one wicket
 haryana ke is leg spinner ne kaha, ‘‘ham sabhi koshish kar acchhee gendbaaji kar sakate hai or main bas yahi karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Getting wickets is not in your hands
 kabhi kabhaar saajhedaari ban jaati he or aapako prayek chor se dabaav bananaa hota he
 Mishra hit a half-century in India's first innings
 unhone kaha, ‘‘isliye maine ek chor se yahi karne kaa prayaas kiya, jabaki anya gendbaaj duusare chor se wicket praapt kar rahe the
 In the first innings, fast bowlers did it while in the second innings Ashwin
 tab meri bhoomika dabaav banaae rakhane or gendbaaji karte rahane kii thi
 Hopefully i will get a few more wickets in the next match
 ’’ tippaniyan Mishra said, "while batting with Ashwin, we had a partnership of more than 100 runs, so that we could score more than 550 runs
 isliye isse bhi westeindies par atirikt dabaav ban gaya tha
 As i said, it was a concerted effort and i am completely satisfied with what i did in the first Test
 is samay ham lay main hai or sab chijen sahi chal rahi hai
 We have to move forward in this rhythm
 ’’ unhone kaha ki team badhat banaakar kaaphi utsahit thi lekin khilaadiyon ko khud par sanyam banaae rakhana hoga
 Mishra said, "we were highly motivated after the victory
 yah ekajute prayaas tha or hamane har vibhaag ballebaaji, gendbaaji, kshetrarakshan or kaich lene main har jagah, kaaphi badhiya khel dikhaaya
 But we have to forget it now and focus on the next match completely
 hamaara prayaas ab us jeet se aage badhkar aagaamee match or bachi hui siries main acha pradarshan karnaa jari rakhane kaa hoga
 '' mishra ne pehali pari main do wicket chatkaaye the, jabaki duusari pari main ek hi wicket praapt kar sake the
 The leg-spinner from Haryana said, "we can all bowl well by trying and i was trying to do just that
 wicket hasil karnaa aapke haathon main nahin hota
 Sometimes a partnership is formed and you have to apply pressure from each end
 ’’ mishra ne bharat kii pehali pari main ardhashatak jadaa tha
 He said, "so i tried to do the same from one end while the other bowlers were getting wickets from the other end
" pehali pari main aisa tej gendbaajon ne kiya jabaki duusari pari main aswin ne
 My role then was to keep the pressure on and bowl
 ummid he ki main agle match main kuch or wicket hasil karuunga
 '' Comments mishra ne kaha, ‘‘aswin ke saath ballebaaji karte hue hamane 100 se zyada ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai, jisase ham 550 se zyada ran kaa score bana sake
 Therefore, this also created additional pressure on the West Indies
 jaisaa ki maine kaha, yah ekajute prayaas tha or maine pehle test main jo kuch bhi kiya, usase main puri tarah se santusht hum
 We are in rhythm right now and everything is going well
 hamen aage isi lay main badhanaa hoga
 He said that the team was very excited to take the lead but the players would have to keep restraint on themselves
 mishra ne kaha, ‘‘ham jeet ke baad kaaphi zyada prerit the
 It was a concerted effort and we played a great game in every department, batting, bowling, fielding and taking catches everywhere
 lekin hamen ab use bhoolanaa hoga or puri tarah se agle match par dhyaan lagaana hoga
 Our effort will now be to move beyond that win and continue to perform well in the upcoming match and the remaining series

 koyala block aavanton ke liye pratispardhi boli vyavastha ko samay par lagu karne main vifal rahane ke liye sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue kaig ne apni report main kaha he ki yadi boli ke jariye aavanton kii prakriya lagu kar di jaati to 1
 Some portion of the 86 lakh crore rupees could have come in the government coffers
 jaiswal ne kaha ki unka mantralay kaig kii report ke sabhi pahaluon se sahamat nahin he
 In the assessment made by the auditor, only a few aspects of coal block allocation have been made the basis
 unhone kaha ki ham kaig kii gananaa se puri tarah sahamat nahin hai
 The coal minister said that private companies were given the task of developing coal blocks because the public sector company Coal India was not able to meet the growing need of the country

 Rakhi festival can prove to be an important model for Make in India
 jahaan beete saal tak desh main raakhi ke tyohaar par karodon kii raakhi padosi desh china se nirmit hokar bazaar main bikati thi, 2017 main maid in india raakhiyon kaa bolbalaa rahaa
 Due to this, the demand for rakhi in the market remained sluggish, traders' sales remained half and profits also decreased
 raakhi kaarobaari ise jiesti kaa asar bhi maan rahe hai lekin jaankaron ke mutabik, raakhi kaarobaar mek in india ke liye 'blessing in disgij' sabit ho saktaa he
 As of 2016, there was a turnover of about Rs 15-20 crore in the country
 isamen lagbhag 5 karod rupee tak kii raakhi china le emport kii jaati thi or china kii in emported raakhi se raakhi treders kaa profit margin bad jaataa tha
 But after the introduction of GST in the country from July 1, a 12 percent tax on Rakhi Manufacturing was proposed
 ise bhi padhein: 36 saal se rakshabandhan par PM modi ko raakhi baandhti ai hai yah pakistani bahanwahin tyohaar se pehle bharat-china seemaa par tanaav ke asar se raakhi treders ne china main nirmit raakhiyon ke liye bada order place nahin kiya
 At the same time, due to the anti-chinese product campaign in the country, buyers were seen avoiding the rakhi of China
 in donon kaarnon se jahaan bazaar main raakhi kii maang ke saath-saath sasti raakhi ke din khatm hote dikhe vahiin bik rahi raakhiyon kii keemat main bhi ijapha dekhne ko mila
 While the cheapest Rakhi at the Rakhi stall was priced at Rs 10 due to the presence of Chinese products until last year, the cheapest Rakhi at the stall was sold for Rs 20 this year
 vahiin sade dhaage kii raakhi jahaan beete saal 5 rupee kii biki, is saal stall par uski keemat 10 rupee rakhi gai
 Traders claim that they had to increase prices due to GST and Made in India rakhi
 ise bhi padhein: kam hogi bengali mithai 'sandesh' kii mithaas, laga 5% gstraki kaarobaariyon ke mutabik, yah puraa kaarobaar anorgenised sector main he
 At the same time, Rakhi Traders' instant income from Chinese products has ended
 lihaaja agle saal unhen desh main nirmit raakhiyon main hi apni kamai kaa mauka dekhne kii majaburi he
 After coming under the purview of GST, rakhi traders will have to pay 12% tax on manufacturing
 lekin unke liye bazaar main badi maang maujuud rahegi kyonki china se aane vaali raakhiyon kii sthiti bazaar main mek in india ke saamne feeki pad sakati he
 It is worth noting that Varanasi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Indore and Jaipur are important centers for manufacturing rakhi in the country
 in jagahon se kul milakar 50 se 60 tarah kii rakhiyaan nirmit hoti hai jinaki keemat 10 rupee se lekar 1000 rupee tak he
 In making rakhi, manufacturers require silk and cotton yarn as well as cheap-expensive stones, pearls, sandalwood, etc
 vahiin hai-and raakhiyon kaa bada kaarobaar jesh main jewalers karte hai jahaan mahange james and jewelery ke saath-saath sona or chaandi kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The way products manufactured in China during the last decade were holding on to the Indian festival, it can be gauged from this that more than one-fourth of Rakhi's business was in possession of products manufactured in China during this period
 isliye, mahaj raakhi ke kaarobaar main china ke product kii dhak kam hone se desh main nirmit raakhiyon kaa kaarobaar badhane kii ummid he
 Apart from this, other festivals like Holi, Deepawali, etc
 can also be avoided in China by making products in this area

 He also instructed the players of the Indian team that they would have to adapt to the game as some unusual bounce could be found on the pitch

 The Rs 11,400 crore bank scam case against diamond trader Nirav Modi will also be carried out in a court of law, similar to the Bofors and 2G cases
 yani is cese main bhi abhiyojan paksh ko munh kii khaani padegi
 This is to say the defense lawyer Vijay Agarwal on behalf of Nirav Modi
 india today ke saath exclusive intervyuu main agarwal ne daawa kiya ki kathith pienbi ghotaale main namjad unka muvakkil doshi nahin he
 Agarwal has also pleaded on behalf of several high profile suspects in the telecom scam
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘saare aarope (neerav modi ke khilaaf) galat hai
 If someone has committed a fraud, why would he leave behind movable assets worth Rs 5600 crore which have been taken over by the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 agar muvakkil (neerav modi) kaa frod kar bhaagane kaa iraadaa hota to wo apana sab kuch videsh le jaataa,jaisaa ki vijay maalya ne kiya
 Why would he leave diamonds and jewelery worth 5600 crores in India, which has been claimed by the Enforcement Directorate itself
 ’tark ke saath nahin dekha kesawakil vijay agarwal ne daawa kiya ki unke muvakkil ke khilaaf pienbi cese trial ke dauraan kahin nahin tikega
 Agarwal said, 'no one is looking at it in a logical manner
 yahi boforce cese main hua
 This happened in 2G case
 koyale se jude kuch maamalon main bhi aisa hi hua
 The same is going to happen in this case
 kisi ne bhi ise taarkikta ke saath nahin dekha
 He said, 'how long does it take for a diamond trader to convert his resources into diamonds and then take them out
 usne sab kuch band kar diya hota
 Agarwal refused to disclose where Nirav Modi is at the moment
 agarwal ke mutabik unhone apane muvakkil se phone par baat kii he
 However, Agarwal refused to give any consideration to the FIR filed in the bank fraud against the client, terming it as an 'incomplete document'
 vijay agarwal ne kaha, ‘abhi aarope tay nahin kiye gaye hai
 This is just an FIR
 or exiaar hameshaa hi puri tasviir nahin dikhaati
 At this time i do not know what the prosecution has
 ’ unke mutabik jab pravartan nideshaalay apni shikaayat darj kara degaa or abhiyojan agency chargeshit daakhil kar degi, tab ve bachaav paksh ke naate apni taiyaari karenge
 Easy to say, not to prove When Agrawal was questioned regarding the fund grab by Nirav Modi, he again cited the fate of the case related to 2G licenses
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘kahana bahut aasaan hota he lekin kanoon kii adaalat main ise sabit kar paanaa alag baat he
 In the 2G case, we had heard about a bribe of 200 crores
 kahaan he wo?’ haalanki agarwal ne sandigdh tranjection kii nigaraanee karne vaale bank adhikariyon kii bhoomika ko lekar sawaal bhi khadey kiye
 Aggarwal said, "whatever it is, it is only a question of increasing the credit towards the bank without additional security, as in the case of many people
" bainkon kii ore se mote charge vasuul kiye jate hai
 The directors of the bank do not know how this branch was making so much money through bank charges? If the messages were being sent without anyone's knowledge, then how was the bank charging the bank charge on them
 ’vijay agarwal ne kaha, ‘sabhi bill jinhen discount diya gaya, kaa dark register number he
 Everything is recorded in the bank's books
 ’vakil ne jor dekar kaha ki wo isi tarah ke keson ko pehle bhi kamyaabi ke saath lard chuke hai
 The reason for this is that the prosecution lacks strong evidence
 agarwal ne kaha, ‘2ji maamle main har media house ne ‘tathy’ ginaae the or aap jaanate hai ki kya hua
 In the Bofors case too, he gave all kinds of 'facts', what happened
 railway ghotaale main das din ke andar hamen jamaanat mil gai
 ' ol india muslim personal lau board (AIMPLB) ke member rahe salmaan nadvi par amarnath mishra ke aaropon ko lekar bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki amarnath mishra ke aaropon main kuch sachai mujhako nahin lagati he
 He said that the larger the amount, the bigger the charges are, i feel that the charges were not made well
 in aaropon main koi dam nahin he
 There does not seem to be any truth in Amarnath Mishra's allegations, because there is no basis in the manner in which the deal worth 5000 crores has been talked about
 'ram mandir vahaan tha or vahiin banegaa'ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki ram kaa bhavy divya mandir vahaan tha, mandir banake rahegaa
 Accusations and counter-arguments and debates will continue
 maamla chaahe supreme court se tay ho, chaahe aapasi sauhaard se ho yaa phir kanoon banaakar ho
 But a grand Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya
 '2019 chunaav se pehle hoga mandir kaa shilanyas'unhone kaha ki adhikansh musalmaan yah sochane lage hai ki court agar mandir ke liye kah degaa, to kahin shehanai bajegi or kahin matam hoga, to ham kyon naa de den
 Both will be happy
 hindu bhi khush rahegaa, musalmaan bhi khush rahegaa
 He said that the construction should start by the end of 2018, the construction of the temple will start along with the foundation stone before the elections in 2019, only then will go to the polls
 'ravishankar ko dena chahie jawaab'amarnath mishra par sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki nadvi ne manaa kiya he yaa nahin, mujhe pataa nahin
 But i am not convinced on the charge of Rs 5000 crore
 amarnath mishra ko main nahin jaanata or yah bhi nahin jaanata ki unhone kis aadhaar par ye aarope lagaae hai
 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar should answer this
 'mandir ko duniya kii koi takat nahin roak sakati'unhone kaha ki agar vah unke kareebi hai to shri shri ravishankar iskaa sahi uttar denge
 Because what happened happened between Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Nadvi
 mishra ke bich main nahin hui
 The temple will be built
 mandir ko duniya kii koi takat roak nahin sakati

 In ODI International cricket, we have got used to seeing the number of runs between fours and sixes
 lekin aane vaale samay main kuch badlaav dekhne ko milenge
 For some time, ODI cricket had become a game of just batsmen, in such a situation, these changes are no less than a living for the bowlers in the coming times
 international cricket council ne shuukravaar ko vanade cricketke niyamon main teen ahm badlaav kiye hai saath hi tii-20 international ke bhi ek niyam ko badla gaya he
 The new rules will come into effect from July 5
 cricket bhadrajanon kaa khel kaha jaataa he or isamen ballebaaj or gendbaaj ke bich santulan bane rahanaa chahie lekin vanade international ke niyamon ke chalate gendbaaj kaaphi laachaar ho gaye the
 These changes in ODI international-1-icc has ended the funding of batting powerplay from ODI International
 abhi tak 15 se 40 over ke bich main ballebaaji karne vaali team powerple le sakati thi
 Due to fielding restrictions in the five-over powerplay, batsmen could score a lot of runs
 batting powerple khatm hone se gendbaaj jarur raahat kii saans lenge
 2-ICC has also decided to remove the rule of placing mandatory fielders in the catching position in the initial 10 overs (mandatory powerplay)
 is niyam main badlaav ke baad gendbaaji karne vaali team apane hisaab se field set kar sakegi
 The additional pressure on the bowler and captain for the field settlement will end
 3-iske alaava ek or bada badlaav ye hoga ki 30 gaj ke cirkil ke baahar aakhri ke 10 overon main 4 kii jagah paanch fielderon ko lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Now for the batsmen to get runs in the last over, it will not be as easy as before
 tii-20 main no ball kaa nayaa niyamvanade ke alaava tii-20 international kaa bhi ek niyam badla gaya he
 Now the batsman will get a free hit on all types of no balls
 isse pehle gendbaajon ke krij ke baahar pair hone vaali no ball par hi ballebaajon ko free hit milti thi
 This rule has brought a new good news for batsmen in T20
 jaruri the 'ye' badlavvanade cricket main gendbaajon ke liye ye badlaav bahut jaruri the
 There has been a lot of change in cricket since the arrival of T20 format
 cricket puri tarah se ballebaajon kaa khel banataa ja rahaa tha
 Scores above 300 were very common and scores above 400 were no longer safe
 nae niyam 5 july se lagu ho jaaenge or dekhnaa hoga isse gendbaajon ko kitni madad milti he
 In the ODI International match which is becoming a batsmen's game completely, new possibilities will be seen for the bowlers once again
