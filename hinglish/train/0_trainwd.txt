 The doctors under the leadership of Omshankar came out on the movement
 doctoron ne pedo ke neeche opidi lagaakar aspataal main buniyadi suvidhaon ke abhaav kaa sankethik virodh darj karaayaa
 Doctors and students passed the proposal that they want AIIMS at BHU
 lekin ames to nahin bana balki dow
 Omshankar and his colleague Drs
 raviranjan ko nilambit kar andolan ko kuchal diya gaya
 The reason for this was that BHU Vice Chancellor and Padmashri, the eminent scientist Prof
 lalji singh parade ke peeche ames na banane dene ke liye ade hue the
 India Today's correspondence between the Prime Minister's Office, the Vice Chancellor's Office and the National Planning Commission from February 2013 to January 2014 revealed that the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Human Resource Development and Planning Commission had agreed to set up AIIMS in Banaras, but earlier The Vice Chancellor, who had been demanding AIIMS, later became opposed to his own proposal

 The then Prime Minister of Lalji Singh, Dr
 manmohan singh ko likhe ek bhavuk or vicharottejak patr se hoti he
 In the letter, the vice-chancellor strongly advocated the creation of AIIMS in BHU, "as you know, this area of the country is backward and the condition of health services here is poor
 hamaara santhaan or aspataal purvi uttar pradesh, pashchimi bihar, chhattisgarh, jharkhand or madhya pradesh ke kuch ilaakon or yahaan tak ki nepal tak ke logon kaa ilaaj karata he
 "in this paper, along with giving details of bhu's medical courses, he cites the report of India Today magazine," Our University has been selected as the number one university in the country on the basis of research publication (india today-nielsen Survey 2012)
 ’’ saath hi unhone pradhanmantri ko yaad dilaayaa, ‘‘hamaara santhaan purvanchal kaa ames kaha jaataa he
 i want to bring to your notice that the Government of India had proposed to upgrade the institute to make AIIMS, but the proposal was never implemented
 ’’ medical college ko jald-se-jald ames kaa darja dene kii baat ke saath unhone apana patr khatm kiya
 He also wrote a similar letter to the Planning Commission

 The HRD ministry also agreed that if BHU wants to do so, it has no problem in giving the medical college under the control of the Ministry of Health
 purvanchal waalon ko unki dashakon se chali aa rahi maang bahut aasaani se maanate hue patr main aage kaha gaya, ‘‘donon mantralay iemes-biechayu ko ames ke darje tak apgrade karne ke prastaav par sahamat hai or yojana ayog bhi iskaa samarthan karata he, isliye mantralay se anurodh he ki vah is vishay main uchit nirnay le
 "and the Vice Chancellor against AIIMS! After this Office Memorandum of the Planning Commission, sweets should have been distributed in Kashi and the Chancellor himself should have been the happiest, who pushed this proposal
" ames banane kaa matlab tha ki jis sar sundar laal aspataal ke liye is samay prati bed 21,450 ru
 The budget for the year is allotted, that budget being Rs 16,79,000
 prati bed ho jaataa
 That is, the capacity of the hospital in that area would have increased by 800 times, where thousands of children die of encephalitis every year and millions of people are suffering from arsenic-related diseases

 But exactly the opposite happened

 Dr
 om shankar kehete hai, ‘‘vartmaan vyavastha main kulapati hi biechayu ke medical college or aspataal ke sarvesarva hai
 The entire financial management of the hospital is under his supervision and he decides how to spend the money
 agar ames banataa he to usamen unke paas koi prashasnic adhikaar nahin hoga
 In such a situation, the chancellor, who considered the hospital as his property, was overturned
 ’’ ames nirmaan ke khilaaf kulapati ke is rukh kaa khulaasa yojana ayog ke sanyukt sachiv pitam singh kii swasthya sachiv keshav desiraju ko 10 janvari, 2014 ko likhi chitthee se hota he
 a copy of this letter was also sent to the Chancellor of BHU

 "chancellor Khamoshin on Correspondence
 India Today continuously tried to know the stand of the Vice Chancellor on the creation of AIIMS

 The Joint Bench of Chief Justice Ajay Kumar Tripathi and Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra gave their verdict on July 30 while hearing the case in Bilaspur High Court
 jisamen kaha kiadalatamen upasthit hokar anjali jain ne aryan arya ke aaropon ko kaarij karte hue kaha he ki uske mata pita ne use avaidh tareeke se rokkar nahin rakhaa he
 According to Anjali, her family has a strong objection to her marriage to a Muslim youth, Ibrahim
 adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki aisi sthiti main ibrahim urf aryan arya ke saath rahane ke bare main kisi nattejey par hunchane ke liye anjali ko kuch vakt diya janaa chahie
 Therefore, the court cannot order Anjali to stay with Ibrahim right now
 adaalat ne yah faisla anjali par choda ki vah yaa to apane mata-pita ke saath rah sakati he yaa phir bilaspur ke kisi sarkari girls hostel main rahe
 The court also directed that Ibrahim and the girl's parents can meet Anjali three days a week if they stay in the hostel
 adaalat ne iske liye dopaher saadhe teen baje se lekar saadhe paanch baje tak kaa samay tay kiya
 Also, the court has made the permission of hostel warden mandatory for this meeting
 bataaya jaataa he ki bilaspur ke sarkari girls hostel main anjali 30 july se lekar 6 agast tak rahi
 On the evening of August 6, Anjali's father met her
 iske kareeb do-teen ghante baad anjali kii tabiyat karaab hui
 He was admitted to Sims Hospital in Bilaspur
 isi raat anjali ke parijanon ne uske karaab swasth or ilaaj kii jaankaree bilaspur ke civil line thane main bataur soochna darj karai
 After this, Anjali is still not known
 ibrahim urf aryan arya kaa aarope he ki anjali ko pagal qaraar dekar uske parijan apane kabje main rakhana chaahate hai
 On August 6, Anjali's father gave her some such medicine in Samosa which worsened her condition
 use sajeesh ke tahat pehle aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya
 Then there was shift to mental patients hospital Dhanwantari in Raipur
 saath hi aarope he ki anjali ke parivaar kaa dawaaiyon kaa kaarobaar he
 So he has given Anjali some medicine that makes her look like a mental patient
 aryan arya ne apane vakil ke jariye supreme court main bilaspur hoicourt ke 30 july ke faisle ko chunauti di he
 It said that the court has prevented Aryan's wife Anjali from living with her husband
 is yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ne is maamle menhadia kesamen hue faisle kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 The Supreme Court has directed Anjali to appear before the court on August 27 after the primary hearing of the case
 is bare main dhamtari police adheekshak or jila magistrate ko notice bhi jari kiya gaya he
 According to Aryan Arya's lawyer Sajid Khan, the Bilaspur High Court has not objected to the legality of the marriage of the two
 unke mutabik donon ke balig hone, ibrahim ke hindu dharm sweekaar karne or arya samaaj mandir main hui shaadi ke pramaan patr or tasviren court main pesh kar di gai hai
 Now on August 27, the case will be heard in the Supreme Court

 darasal, kaanon kii sunne kii kshamta maatr 90 decible hoti he jo lagaataar gane sunne se samay ke saath 40 se 50 decible tak kam ho jaati he
 Because of which the person does not hear distant voice

 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has rejected claims by microblogging website Twitter and a group of media in which it has said that the personal information of TRAI chief Ram Sewak Sharma has been breached
 yuidiai ne ravivaar ko jari bayaan main kaha ki twitor par jo log 'aadhaar sarwar' se aar es sharma kii nijee soochna hasil karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai, vah galat he
 Anyway, all information of a public servant serving for decades is public, which can be easily accessed on Google and other sites
 My Aadhaar number is 7621 7768 2740now i give this challenge to you: Show me one concrete example where you can do any harm to me!— RS Sharma (@rssharma3)july 28, 2018gauratlab he ki bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ke pramukh aar
 s
 sharma ne shanivaar ko twitor par apana 12 ankon kii aadhaar sankhya saarvajanik kar chunauti di thi ki koi bhi iske jariye unka nuksaan karke dikhaae
 After this, various users claimed to have made a dent in their personal information
 khud ko france kaa ek suraksha visheshgy bataane vaale ek yujar ne sharma kaa mobile number se lekar pan sankhya tak saarvajanik karne kaa daawa kiya
 Challenging to breach Aadhaar, however, the TRAI chief, who had been troubled by a public challenge to dent Aadhaar on Twitter, later said that he had given this challenge not as TRAI chief but as a common citizen
 sharma ne ek yujar ko jawaab dete hue kaha, 'yah samajhiye ki maine yah chunauti tri chairman ke naate nahin balki bharat ke ek saamaanya naagarik kii tarah di he
 The French citizen, who described herself as Elliot Anderson, responded to Sharma's challenge to the handle @ fs0c131y, saying, "people can remove your home address, birthday and alternate mobile number
" main yaheen par chhod detaa hum
 i hope you understand that it is not right to make Aadhaar number public
 'TRAI chairman kaa aadhaar chalange fail, minuton main li hua datahalanki, sharma ne apni baat par ade rahete hue likhaa, 'ye jaankariyaan koi sarkari gopneey suchanaaen nahin hai
 He said that the challenge was not only about the phone number and other information, but also on the basis of the information of their Aadhaar number
 sharma ne likhaa, 'maine unhen phone number or duusari soochnaaon ke liye chunauti nahin di thi
 My challenge was to do me no harm
 ab tak isamen koi safalataa unhen nahin mili
 My best wishes are with them 'bataa den ki sharma pehlebhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaranke mahanideshak rah chuke hai or aadhaar pranali ke kattar samarthak hai
 At the same time, the user, who describes himself as a security expert of France, has been constantly criticizing the flaws of the base system
 vah pehle bhi aadhaar main send laga chukaa he
 Love is a beautiful feeling that can only be felt, and when this feeling arises in someone's mind, then you fall in love with everything
 aap us vyakti ko apane jivan kaa ek ahm hissaa bana lete hai
 He shares with him every little thing related to his life
 iske saath hi aap ek duusare ke pyaar main itnaa kho jate hai ki aapako is baat se fark hi nahin padataa he ki aapmen or aapke partner ke bich umr kaa kitna antar he
 However there is a common belief in our society that girls and boys should be younger than boys in a relationship
 lekin kabhi sochaa he ki agar kisi rishte main ladkaa- ladki se chota hota he yaa ladki- ladke se bahut zyada choti hoti he to wo rishta kaisaa hota he
 Let us know: Most people think that money and royal lifestyle is the reason behind marrying someone who is an old man
 lekin jaruri nahin he ki hakeekat main aisa hi ho
 As long as you are happy with your partner, you do not need to care about society
 haalanki kisi rishte main ladkaa-ladki ke bich umr kaa zyada faasla he or unka macurity level baraabar nahin he to isse rishte main tanaav bad saktaa he
 There is also a big difference in the thinking of two people due to more age gap between the partners
 partner ke bich umr kaa zyada faasla hone se family par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 Because going forward, an older person in a relationship may feel that he is old and is no longer of the age to have children
 bataa den ki, umr kisi rishte main pyaar se badhkar nahin hoti he
 If both of you have love, trust in each other, and you both give equal respect to each other, then there will never be bitterness in your relationship
 iske saath hi apane or apane partner ke bich umr ke faasale ko kabhi naa aane den
 Rather focus on improving your relationship
 bijepi main kuldeep singh senger ke khilaaf nahin uthati awajpure pradesh ke rajput jati kaa samarthan hasil he unhenrepe ke aaropee or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ke khilaaf sibiai ne ek baar phir nai exiaar darj kar lee he
 In this FIR, several sections have been imposed including the attempt to murder the rape victim
 ravivaar ko hue car accident main balaatkaar peedita, unki mausi, chachee or vakil savaar the
 Aunt and aunt died on the spot, while the lawyer and the victim are fighting for life
 unnav jile ke bangaramau se vidhayak, kuldeep singh senger ko sibiai ne pichley varsh agast ke maheene main hi ipisi or pokso act kii 4 dhaaraon ke tahat giraftaar kiya tha or tab se ve jail main kaid hai
 Such a big accident in Uttar Pradesh has shaken the whole country
 bhaajapa upi ke adhyaksh swatantra dev singh ne daawa kiya tha ki senger ko party se pehle hi suspend kiya ja chukaa tha, lekin us vakt kii aisi koi khabar maujuud nahin thi, jisamen is baat kaa zikr ho
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also not said anything on this matter yet
 ab unhen party se nikaal diya gaya he, lekin kya unke majboot vot bank kii vajah se hi bhaajapa itani der tak khamosh rahi
 Why did the BJP remain silent for so long? India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed Kuldeep Sengar's political innings and found that not only has Sanger's vote bank increased in the last 17 years, but he has strengthened his grip year after year
 senger ne pichley 17 saalon main unnav kshetra se 4 baar teen partiyon ke tikat se chunaav ladaa he or har baar unhone jeet hasil kii
 In 2002, he contested the Unnao assembly election with a BSP ticket and won only 24 percent of the votes
 2007 main unhone bangaramau vidhansabha chunaav samaajawaadee party ke tikat par ladaa kar 28 pratishat vot paakar jeet darj kii
 In 2012, he again contested from the SP ticket and won 33 percent of the votes in the Bhagwantnagar assembly
 2017 main unhone bhaajapa ke tikat se bangaramau vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or 43 pratishat vot paakar jite
 Two days ago, Congress National General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi also accused the BJP government of saving Sengar
 priyanka ne twit kiya,'ham kyon kuldeep senger jaise logon ke haath main satta kii takat or sangrakshan dete hai or kyon peediton ko akele ladane ke liye chhod dete hai?'padosi ilaakon tak gunjgar sirf ek vidhansabha seat kii baat hoti to bhaajapa shaayad senger par itani meharbaan na hoti
 But the DIU found that Sengar's assembly votes only for the party with which they contest, but the voters of their neighboring assembly also win their own party
 unnav loksabhaa main chah vidhansabhaayen aati hai - unnav, bangaramau, bhagwantnagar, purava, safipur or mohan
 The Mohan Legislative Assembly was formed after delimitation in 2012, so we have the data of this assembly available only after 2012
 2002 main jab senger ne basapa se chunaav ladaa tab unnav kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se teen par basapa jiti thi
 In 2007, when Sanger contested from the Samajwadi Party, the SP had won four of the five assembly seats of Unnao
 2012 main senger ne phir sapa se chunaav ladaa or is baar sapa chah siton main se 5 par jiti
 In the three elections held from 2002 to 2012, BJP could not register a single seat from Unnao region but in 2017, the body was overturned
 2017 main jab senger ne bhaajapa kii tikat se chunaav ladaa tab bhaajapa unnav kii sabhi chah siton par vijayi hui
 Declining competition not only votes, Sengar has also weakened the electoral contest in his assembly
 mukaable ko naapane ke liye DIU ne ENOP- effective number of parties (gambhirtha se chunaav ladane vaali partiyon kii sankhya) ke aankade istemaal kiye
 The ENOP actually shows how many parties fought in one constituency
 isko ek formula se nikaala jaataa he
 We have used the Lokdhaba application of Ashoka University's Trivedi Center for Political Data for our analysis
 kuldeep singh senger kaa majboot hota vot bankjis vidhansabha main ENOP zyada hoga vahaan par zyada partiyaan gambhir rup se lard rahi hongi
 In 2002 when Sanger won by just 24 percent of the votes, ENOP 5
 26 tha, matlab unnav vidhansabha se us samay 5 se bhi zyada ummidavaar gambhirtha se chunaav lard rahe the
 In 2007, Bangarmau (from where Sanger contested) had ENOP 5
 2012 main bhagwantnagar main yah ENOP ghatakar 4
 5 happened and in 2017 it decreased to 3
 03 rah gaya - matlab ab keval 3 hi partiyaan gambhirtha se vahaan chunaav lard rahi hai jisamen senger kaaphi majboot hai
 The castes of jat-pat are from Rajput caste and have strong ties with Thakur leaders
 vipaksh dwaara yogi par aarope bhi lagate rahe hai ki wo thakuron ke prati vishesh lagaav rakhte hai
 Being a powerful leader in this field, the BJP had been avoiding the sidelines till now
 unnav lok sabha ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne is baat ko tab sabit kar diya tha jab ve loksabhaa chunaav sampann hone ke baad june main hi senger ko milane sitapur jail gaye the
 He then told the media that he had been in jail for a long time
 senger kaaphi lokapriy vidhayak hai, isliye main chunaavon ke baad unako dhanyavad dene aayaa tha
 On this meeting, BSP supremo Mayawati lashed out at her and on Tuesday she also mentioned it in her tweet
 lekin is twit main mayawati ne bhi senger kaa naam na liya or sakshi maharaj ko hi target karte najar ai
 Armaan Kohli, who came out of Bigg Boss 7's house, said in a special conversation from Aaj Tak that they are planning to get married next year in 2014
 to kya ye samajha jaae ki ve kalose kii bahan tanisha mukherjee se shaadi karenge, jo philhal big bos ke ghar main hai? kyonki big bos ke ghar main donon ke rishte behad madhur rahe or jis tarah kii khabaren ghar se baahar ain, ve to kam se kam isi ore ishaara karti hai
 On a question about marriage, Armaan said that he is now 40 years old and he feels that this age is right for marriage

 Judge Sameer Ajkar will deliver the verdict in the case
 abhiyojan paksh ke mutabik patrkaar jede kii hatya mafia sargana chota rajan ke ishaare par kii gai thi
 After investigating the matter, the police filed a chargesheet in the MCOCA court
 mumbai main anderworld mafia sargana chota rajan ke khilaaf kai maamle chal rahe hai
 Rajan, who is lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi, makes a court appearance through video conferencing during the hearing of all the cases
 buddhavaar ko bhi kuch aisa hi hoga
 When all 11 accused journalists, including Chhota Rajan, will be present in Mumbai's Special MCOCA Court to hear the verdict of the Jade murder case
 kadi suraksha ke bich jaj samir ajkar apana faisla sunaayenge
 According to the prosecution, the underworld don Chhota Rajan felt that Jade wrote against him while most wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim was glorified
 sirf isi vajah se chota rajan ne patrkaar jede kii hatya karwaai thi
 On the other hand, according to Chhota Rajan's lawyer Anshuman Sinha, the prosecution says that Chhota Rajan hatched this conspiracy and he had some extra judicial confession in the name of evidence
 lekin hamaara yahi kahana he ki ye colls farji the or isaki koi jaankaree chota rajan ko nahin thi
 Actually, there are allegations against Chhota Rajan that when there was an outcry after Jade's murder, Rajan called several news channels' offices and said that he only wanted to threaten Jade
 uskaa iraadaa unki hatya karne kaa nahin tha
 The same recording was produced by the prosecution as evidence in the court
 abhiyojan paksh ke mutabik un dinon videsh main baithe rajan ne shooter satish kaaliya or uske saathiyon kii madad lee
 According to the chargesheet, another journalist, Jigana Vora, helped Rajan's henchmen in identifying Jadee
 lekin bachaav paksh kaa kahana he ki abhiyojan paksh ne saboot thik se adaalat main pesh nahin kiye hai
 After this sensational murder, the Mumbai Police spoke in a press conference about how the accused followed Jade
 media ne bhi us samay sisitivi footage dikhaaya tha
 According to media reports, the people appearing in the footage were the same killers who followed Jade
 or ant main unhone hi jede ko goli maari thi
 But the counsel for two more accused, including Santosh Deshpande, Satish Kalia, says that all the above evidence was not brought to the court
 do saal pehle jab rajan ko indonesia se laayaa gaya tha
 The case was then handed over from the Mumbai Police to the CBI
 sarkari vakil pradeep gharaat ne 155 gavaahon ko pesh kiya or tihaad jail main band chota rajan kaa jo wois sample liya gaya tha, wo bhi anya awaazon se match ho gaya tha
 Its report was also presented in court
 is puure maamle main belastic or vaigyanik saboot abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se pesh kiye gaye the
 And they feel that all these evidences and statements of witnesses will be successful in punishing the accused

 The Delhi Police set an example by freeing a two-and-a-half-year-old child kidnapped from outside the house within just 72 hours three days ago
 kidnaping or baccha bechney ke aarope main police ne do mahilaon or ek purush ko giraftaar kiya he
 According to the police, the child was abducted due to the craving to fill the lap and the greed for money
 bachche kaa apharan ilaake main hi gharelu naukaraani kii kaam karne vaali shivani naam kii ek mahila ne kiya tha
 On Monday, under the guise of Shivani, the police safely recovered the kidnapped child from the house of Rashmi, who lives in Ishwar Colony
 darasal shivani ne rashmi ke kehane par hi bachche kaa apharan kiya tha
 Shivani was helped by Rashmi's nephew in Kidnapping

 Also, out of 45 thousand rupees given by Rashmi to Shivani for bringing the child, the police also recovered 42 thousand rupees
 ghar ke baahar khelte samay gaayab hua tha bacchabavana ke indraraj colony ke kiraye ke makaan main sapariwaar rahane vaale sukhram nijee company main kaam karte hai, jabaki patni gharelu mahila hai
 Around 3pm on 23 February

 But Abhishek mysteriously disappeared suddenly from the same day
 parijanon ne apane str par abhishek kii harsambhav talash kii, lekin uskaa koi suraag nahin mila
 On the same day, Abhishek's father lodged a report of the son's disappearance at Bawana police station

 In CCTV footage, a woman wearing a red salwar kameez was seen carrying Abhishek on her lap
 police team ne footage se mahila kii photo nikalwai or uski talash shuru kar di
 However, the police did not have to wander far to find the woman
 ilaake ke hi ek shaks ne yuvati kii pahchaan sayed colony main rahane vaali shivani ke rup main kar lee
 Kidnappers were just five lanes away, tell us that the Sayyid Colony in which the kidnapped Shivani resides in the child is leaving five lanes from Abhishek's house
 lekin police team jab shivani ke ghar pahunchi, to vahaan taala laga mila
 Asked by neighbors, it was revealed that Shivani had appeared a day earlier
 padosiyon ne bataaya ki shivani mul rup se uttar pradesh ke hardoi kii rahane vaali he or yahaan shivani kiraaye ke makaan main rahati he
 It is also learned that Shivani works as a domestic maid in the cell while her husband works in the factory
 ab police team sargarmi se shivani kii talash main lag gai
 Eventually, the police team took Shivani into custody from Anand Vihar bus stand in Delhi on the evening of 25 February
 thane main laakar shivani se sakhti se poochtacha kii gai, to jald hi usne apana jurm kubul kar liya
 Kidnapping live video sold for 45 thousand rupees Kidnapped Bachshivani said that he abducted Abhishek and sold him to Rashmi for 45 thousand rupees
 shivani ne bataaya ki abhishek ab rashmi ke paas he
 The police team raided Rashmi's house at Shivani's behest and recovered Abhishek from there safely

 In the lure of filling up the sun, Kidnappingershmi told that she had a younger sister living in Bahadurgarh, who has no boy

 Rashmi had tempted Shivani that she would give him the amount of money when she brought the child
 rain water harvesting system ke maddenjar engiti ne dilli sarkaar se resident welfare association kii suchi dene kaa nirdesh diya he
 The National Green Tribunal has asked the Central Ground Water Authority, Delhi Jal Board to file a status report with full information about the capital's RWA

 Election results in Maharashtra were to be held for two weeks, but still there does not appear to be a government
 maharashtra main saath-saath chunaav ladane vaali BJP or shivasena ab aapas main is tarah lard rahi hai, jaise janm-janm kii dushman hon
 In fact, the mutual trust between the leaders of the two parties has diminished so much that negotiations between the two parties have ceased
 aisa lagane laga he, jaise donon dalon ke bich sampark kaa koi zariyaa hi nahin he
 The figures in Maharashtra are also similar that BJP and Shiv Sena can come together, only then a stable government can be up and running
 maharashtra vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya 288 he or bahumat ke liye 145 chahie
 Now BJP has 105, Shiv Sena has 56, NCP has 54 and Congress has 44 mlas
 sadan main nirdaleey vidhayakon kii sankhya 13 he or choti partiyon ke 14 vidhayak hai, jinamein se adhiktar BJP yaa shivasena ko samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 So, it is natural for BJP and Shiv Sena to come together
 magar yahaan kai tarah ke pench hai
 The Shiv Sena says that there was an agreement between the central leadership of the BJP and that in the event of formation of a government in Maharashtra, two-and-a-half-year rule should take place in turn
 shivasena kaa tark he ki hamaara mukhyamantri bananaa chahie
 The reason behind this is that for the first time a member of the Thackeray family has contested and won
 yahi nahin, shivasena maharashtra main kuch malaaidaar mantralay bhi chaahati he or dilli main bhi kendriya mantrimandal main apane mantriyon kii sankhya badhanaa chaahati he
 Now if for some reason this does not happen, then another option is to give NCP support to Shiv Sena and Congress will remain absent from the House during voting
 aise main bahumat kaa aankada 123 ho jayega, lekin shivasena ke 56 or NCP ke 54 milakar bhi kul 110 vidhayak hote hai, so, is gathbandhan ko bhi 13 anya vidhayakon kii zarurat hogi
 The third option is BJP and NCP to form a government together
 jo yah suzav de rahe hai, unka kahana he ki jis tarah pravartan nideshaalay (ED) prafull patel or sharad pavaar par karrwai kar rahaa he, yah sambhav ho saktaa he
 Not only this, there are many cases against Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar, so in such a situation Sharad Pawar can be prepared to support BJP
 is bich maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii kavayad ke tahat kai tarah kii baithkon kaa daur bhi jari he
 It has also been reported that BJP is considering the names of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and BJP state president Chandrakant Patil in place of Devendra Fadnavis, while Fadnavis took refuge in the Sangh headquarters
 jis tarah fadanvis ne yah ghoshnaa kar di thi ki mukhyamantri to vahi banenge, vah kai netaaon ko nagavar guzara tha
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut met NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Pawar said in his press conference that he would meet Sonia Gandhi once
 lekin saath hi pavaar ne yah bhi kaha ki agle do din main maharashtra main kya hoga, yah vah nahin bataa sakate
 Meanwhile, in Delhi, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel met Gadkari, but also said that his meeting has nothing to do with forming the government in Maharashtra
 is tarah, yah saaf kaha ja saktaa he ki maharashtra main sarkaar banane kaa rasta tabhi saaf hoga, jab shivasena ke liye BJP do kadam peeche hate or shivasena bhi ek kadam peeche hate, varanaa kahin aisa na ho ki donon partiyon kii tanatani or 'main bada, main bada' ke chakkar main maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan hi lag jaae

 In sharp contrast to this saying, Pullela Gopichand, who has been instrumental in getting India's medals in badminton consistently through Saina Nehwal at the London Olympics and PV Sindhu in Rio, says he was lucky not to be good at studies and passed the IIT exam
 Could not, because of which he opened the way to become a successful player
 khelon ke vishay par charchaa karte huegopichandane kaha, ‘main or meraa bhai donon khelon main hissaa lete the

 Gopi mortgaged his home for the academy, becoming only the second Indian to win the All England Championship in 2001 and due to injury, he decided to retire and opened his own academy
 haalanki, academy kholane kii unki raah aasaan nahin rahi
 Gopichand said, 'I remember that a few years ago i went to a public sector company
 mujhe subah nau baje se shaam saadhe paanch baje tak lagaataar teen din baithaaya gaya or teen din baad shaam ko ek bade padaadhikari ne mere paas aakar kaha ki badminton main intnational khel banane kii kshamta nahin he

 He said, 'I started the academy in 2004 with 25 young children
 sindhu aath saal ke saath sabase kam umr ke bacchon main thi or 15 saal kaa pi kashyap sabase adhik umr kaa tha
 When i started coaching, my dream was that India would win Olympic medals one day
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki itani jaldi 2012 main ham apana pehla padak jeet jaaenge
 'gopichand said in a Majakiya tone,' i think maybe i should retire now because all my goals have been fulfilled
 ’gopichand ne kaha ki kuch logon ne unke saath kaaphi bura bartaav kiya jabaki vah un logon ke abhaari hai jo unka samarthan karne ke liye khadey the
 Meanwhile, Sindhu's father PV Ramanna said that the people who used to criticize her earlier for allowing her daughter to pursue a career in sports are now appreciating her achievement and her sacrifice
 ramanna ne kaha, ‘sindhu jab training ke liye kabhi kabhi subah chaar baje or kabhi kabhi subah paanch baje jaati thi or phir ham jab paidal ghoomane nikalate the to kaaphi log kehete the ki aap itani mushkil kyon uthaa rahe ho lekin ab vahi log kehete hai ki hamen aapaki beti par garv he

 "they even say that an accused was seen in the village till a day before, but the police could not arrest him
" baharhaal, 26 sitambar kii shaam tak police ne 12 main se nau aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But despite the accusations of the aggrieved party and eight of the 12 accused being from the Jat community, Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has so far not given a single statement on the entire matter

 His biggest support in this battle is his picture of Babasaheb who sits there with great reverence
 aan kii is ladaai ke bare main gajala ne kaha, ‘‘jab tak chowk par baba sahib kii murti nahin lagegi or play ground daliton ko nahin diya jayega, ham waapas nahin lautenge
 "on the other hand, there is another aspect of the picture in the village
 jat samudaay ke narendra singh ne kuch daliton kii maujuudagi main ‘ahlaan paanaa chowk’ par india today ko bataaya ki yahaan aaj bhi dalit or anya samudaay ke logon kii gaayen bandha rahi hai
 Narendra Singh said, "if the brothers who have left the village come back, what opposition do we have
 ’’ unhone kaha ki jo log kachhari main dharna de rahe hai, un logon ko kuch sanghathanon kii shah mil rahi he
 The Dalits who are going on strike are pressuring the Dalits of the village to join them
 dalit samudaay ke manjit naam ke ladke kii 13 sitambar ko dalit samudaay ke hi logon ne pitayee kar di
 19 Dalits were arrested in this case
 manjit ne kaha ki dharne ko samarthan dene ke mudde par jhagada shuru hua tha
 But when India Today asked the people of the Jat community, "when there is so much brotherhood, why don't you allow Baba Saheb's statue to be displayed with greatness
 ’’ is par kootnithik jawaab tha, ‘‘abhi chowk par jhagada ho rahaa he
 If someone damages the idol tomorrow, a new war will arise

 "the same thing came up in the much talked about incident in Mirchpur, 50 km from Bhagana
 19 april, 2010 ko ek kute ke bhunkane jaisi maamuli ghatana ne gaanv main aisa bhayankar rup liya ki do din baad yahaan daliton ke 18 gharon main aag laga di gai

 ’’mirchpur kii vyathaa kaa doosraa sira hisar main daliton kii ladaai lard rahe saamaajik kaaryakarta vedapal tanvar ke farm house main khulata he
 Satyavan Valmiki, who has been representing Dalit families living here for two years, says, "people living in the village will not be able to tell you the truth
" jin logon ne adaalat main jaaton ke khilaaf gavaahi di ve sab ke sab gaanv se baahar hai
 Who is there in the village who has not slapped the Jats? ’’ unki sidhi maang he ki sarkaar unhen hisar main plot de
 What is the opinion of the government about the Dalits and their well-wishers, the idea came from an incident that took place last month
 tanvar ke farm house par saanp ke kaatane se suman naam kii mahila kii maut ho gai
 In this case, the police kept the owner of the farm house Vedpal Tanwar in jail under the section of culpable homicide
 zyaadaatar valmiki pariwaron ne ise tanvar ke khilaaf sarkaar kii sajeesh bataaya
 Tanwar said, "I was kept in jail for a month

 "tanwar says that the leadership of both the major political parties of the state is in the hands of the Jat community
" haryana main dalit utpeeda kii kahani puraani he
 Before Hooda, five Dalits were beaten to death in the Dulina incident under the rule of Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) because they were guilty of removing cow's leather
 vah bahut puraani baat nahin he jab haryana main daliton ke vot dabang jatiyon ke log daalaa karte the
 But now times are changing

 In the by-election, Kuldeep Bishnoi defeated Om Prakash Chautala's son Ajay Chautala by over 23,000 votes

 Even before it set foot in Uttar Pradesh, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) tried to establish itself in Haryana
 lekin yahaan kii siyaasi aabhohawaa main uskaa hathi sehatmand nahin ho sakaa

 rss's youth wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has launched a massive campaign in the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and other South India to join the youth who are going to become voters for the first time

 He reported that about 1 this year
 8 karod nae voter panjikrut honge, jo aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main matdaan karenge
 Apart from this, BJP sources say that for the last three years RSS has been campaigning extensively to connect students with ideology
 purvottar bharat ke rajyon main adivasee yuvaaon ke liye RSS ne kai shaikshanik or sports kaarykram launch kiye hai
 a senior BJP leader said that his party had adopted a similar strategy in the recently held Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland assembly elections, which also saw positive results

 aaj aae jokihat vidhansabha upachunaav ke nattejey to kam se kam yahi ishaara karte hai
 Jokihat's seat was with the ruling Janata Dal United but now it has been captured by the RJD with a margin of over 40 thousand votes
 nateezon se utsahit tejasvi yadav ne ek baar phir mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolaa he
 The main contest in Jokihat was between rjd's Shahnawaz Alam and jdu's Murshid Alam
 jediu vidhayak sarfaraj alam ne is seat se istipha dekar rashtriya janata dal (argedy) kaa daaman tham liya tha or phir unke arriya se saansad chune jane ke baad yah seat khaali ho gai thi

 Of these, RJD got one seat for Lok Sabha and one assembly while BJP won one seat
 jokihat ke nateezon se saaf he ki sattarudh bijepi-jediu gathbandhan argedy-congress kaa saamana nahin kar sakaa
 Since 2005, JDU has won the Jokihat seat four times in a row since Nitish Kumar became the chief minister, but this time the ruling party had to face defeat
 ye tab hua jab party ne jeet ke liye koi kor-kasar baaki nahin rakhi or is seat ko pratishtha kii ladaai main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Lalu in jail, but incineration is clear from the victory of RJD that the party continues to flourish even after Supremo Lalu Yadav goes to jail
 tejasvi yadav kaa kad is jeet se badhegaa
 The advantage of defeating the BJP-JDU in Bihar will also benefit the opposition alliance which is preparing for the Lok Sabha elections and the position of rivals within the alliance will also be strengthened

 ''shikhar ek shandaar ballebaaj hai
 His injury has hurt the team
 galle main ballebaaji karne se pehle hi shikhar ko chot lagi phir bhi unhone ballebaaji kar shatak banaaya or duusari pari main bhi chot ke baavjood 28 ran banaae
 "team India's director Ravi Shastri's statement is enough to tell that the Indian team will land in the Colombo Test without both the openers
 murali vijay srilanka pahunchate hi anfit ho gaye to ab shikhar dhawan ke hatheli main chot kii vajah se baahar hone se team management kii pareshaani bad gai he
 For the last three years, Team India has depended on the summit for a solid start, so both have not disappointed either
 shikhar-vijay kii jodi ne 50
 Has scored 1205 runs in 24 innings at an average of 20
 vahiin akele murali ke form kii baat karen to vijay ne do saal main 16 test khele hai
 44 in 29 innings of these 16 tests
 79 kii ausat se unhone 1299 ran banaae hai, jisamen 3 shatak or 7 ardhshtkeey pari shaamil hai
 Talking about Shikhar's form, Dhawan played 38 Tests in 14 years
 84 ke ausat se 971 ran batore hai
 During this time, the opener known as Gabbar has scored 3 centuries and 2 fifties
 tippaniyan Now the question is, who will open in Colombo? Cheteshwar Pujara, KL Rahul, Ajinkya Rahane or Rohit Sharma
 keel rahul pehle test main opening kar chuke hai or balla nahin chalane ke baavjood unhen ek mauka mil saktaa he
 At the same time, Cheteshwar Pujara has not got a chance after a bad tour of england-australia
 aise main unhen ummid he unhen shikhar kii chot kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 It is possible that due to this problem of Team India, Rohit Sharma, who is constantly flopting at number three, can also get another life
 vaise shikhar-vijay kaa chotil hona team ke liye badi pareshaani ban gai he or series main 0-1 se pichad chuki bharat ko ab vining combination talashna hoga
 Murali Vijay became unfit as soon as he reached Sri Lanka, now the problem of team management has increased due to Shikhar Dhawan's injury in the palm
 pichley teen saal se zyada samay se thos shuruyaat ke liye team india shikhar -vijay par nirbhar rahi he to donon ne niraash bhi nahin kiya he
 shikhar-vijay pair 50
 20 ke ausat se 24 pariyon main 1205 ran banaae hai
 Talking about Murali's form alone, Vijay has played 16 Tests in two years
 in 16 teston kii 29 pariyon main 44
 He has scored 1299 runs at an average of 79, including 3 centuries and 7 fifties
 agar shikhar ke form kii baat karen to dhawan ne do saal main 14 test khelte hue 38
 There are 971 runs at an average of 84
 is dauraan gabbar ke naam se mashhoor openar ne 3 shatak or 2 ardhshtak banaae hai
 The comments ab sawaal he colombo main opening koun karegaa? cheteshwar pujaara, keel rahul, ajinkya rahane yaa phir rohit sharma
 KL Rahul has opened in the first Test and despite not playing bat, he can get a chance
 vahiin cheteshwar pujaara ko england-australia ke kharaab daure ke baad mauka nahin mila he
 In such a situation, he hopes that he can get the benefit of Shikhar's injury
 mumkin he team india kii is pareshaani kii vajah se number teen par lagaataar flop ho rahe rohit sharma ko bhi ek or jeevandaan mil jaae
 However, shikhar-vijay's injury has become a big problem for the team and India, who had lost 0-1 in the series, will now have to find the winning combination

 # soch bdlo desh bdlega bharat kii under-19 team dwaara australia main khitaab kaa bachaav kar rahi australian team ko haraakar teesri baar khitaab jeet lene kii khabaron or tasveeron ne puure desh ko jashn ke maahaul main dubo diya, or in behad utsahit khilaadiyon ke parivaar vaale bhi apane bacchon kii kamyaabi se hasil hui khushi kaa hissaa bane
 
 
 But to achieve this magnificent victory, this young brigade of India had taken such training, knowing about what the other junior teams would be surprised and the senior teams would also be shocked
 
 
 darasal, under-19 ke in khilaadiyon ko coach bharat arun ne vishwacap se thik pehle bangalore main hue koching camp ke dauraan ek anokhe prayog ke tahat sirf balle or gend se hi train nahin kiya, inhen mushkil se mushkil halaat se do-chaar hone ke liye commando training bhi dilwaai
 
 
 The objective of this training was to teach the team players a lesson of solidarity even in the toughest conditions, for which all the players of the team were removed from the camp in Bangalore and taken to the Civil Hole Forest of Mysore
 
 
 mysore ke in jangalon main khilaadiyon ko kai prakaar ke drill or task ke jariye team building sikhaai gai, or unke bheetar har haal main ladane kii bhaavana ko jagaaya gaya
 
 
 The comments lagata he, bharat arun ne australia ke purv coach jon bukanan kii tarkeeb aajamaai, jo har mushkil series se pehle apni team ke liye jangalon main aise hi bat camp yojit kiya karte the, lekin bharat ke coach kii is tarkeeb kaa asar vishwacap ke maichon main saaf dekhne ko mila
 
 
 Team India won a thrilling one-wicket win against arch-rivals Pakistan
 
 
 uske baad dabaav se ubarte hue behad kareebi semi-final mukaable main bhartiya team ne newzealand ko nau ran se haraaya, tathaa aakhir main sabase zyaada chunauteepurn final mukaable main avijit kahi jane vaali australia kii team ko unheen kii dharti par haraakar khitaab jeeta
 
 
 So, it is clear from these results that the commando training provided by the coach to the players of the team, and the arrogance created by them through the players, was a very important part of India's historic win
 
 
 lekin is shandaar jeet ko hasil karne ke liye bharat kii is yuva brigade ne aisi training lee thi, jiske bare main jaanakar baaki junior timen to kya, senior timen bhi chaunk uthengi
 
 
 In fact, these under-19 players were not just trained with bat and ball by coach Bharat Arun in a unique experiment during the coaching camp in Bangalore just before the World Cup; Also got commando training
 
 
 is training kaa makasad team ke khilaadiyon ko kathin se kathin halaat main bhi ekajutata kaa paath sikhaanaa tha, jiske liye team ke sabhi khilaadiyon ko bangalore ke camp se hataakar mysore ke nagar hole forest main le jaaya gaya
 
 
 In these jungles of Mysore, players were taught team building through a variety of drills and tasks, and the fighting spirit was instilled within them
 
 
 tippaniyan Bharat Arun seems to have tried the tricks of former Australian coach John Buchanan, who used to organize similar butt camps in the jungles for his team before every difficult series, but this tactic of the Indian coach has its effect in World Cup matches
 Got to see clearly
 
 
 team india ne chir-pratidwandvi pakistan ke khilaaf ek wicket se behad romaanchak jeet hasil kii
 
 
 After recovering from the pressure, the Indian team defeated New Zealand by nine runs in a very close semi-final match, and finally won the title by defeating Australia's team, who were called undefeated in the most challenging final
 
 
 so, in nateezon se saaf zaahir he ki coach dwaara team ke khilaadiyon ko dilwaai gai commando training, or uske jariye khilaadiyon main paidaa kiya gaya jujharupan team india kii aitihaasik jeet kaa behad ahm hissaa rahi

 ) pakistan ke ek dainik samachar patr kaa kahana he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main america drone hamalon ko lekar pakistan kii khufia agency iesai or america khufia agency siie ke bich khinchataan chal rahi he
 The newspaper 'daily Times' wrote in its editorial on Friday that Pakistan is opposing the drone strikes, but the US has made it clear that it is not in a mood to stop drone attacks in the country's tribal areas
 america ne haal hi main dakshini wajiristaan ke angoor adda kshetra main drone hamale kiye the, jabaki ek din pehle hi siie or iesai ke bich chaar ghante lambi baithak hui thi
 According to the newspaper, in a recent meeting of the CIA and ISI in Washington, Pakistan had placed a condition to stop the first drone attack with the US for intelligence cooperation in the fight against terrorism
 lekin america ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Tension arose between the two agencies following the arrest of CIA officer Raymond Davis in January this year, and intelligence cooperation between them was also disrupted
 davis kii giraftaar ke baad pakistan main 300-350 siie agent ke kaam karne kaa khulaasa hua tha
 The newspaper writes, "although he left the country to ensure Davis' release, what guarantee is there that no one else will have replaced him

 They do not believe in each other, but they need each other's help

 sonia gandhi ko congress kaa antarim adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 This decision was taken in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) for the post of Congress President
 isse pehle rahul gandhi adhyaksh pad chhodane par ad gaye the
 The CWC appointed Sonia Gandhi as interim president after Rahul Gandhi rejected the request of party leaders
 vah nae adhyaksh ke chunaav tak yah jimmedaari nibhaaengi
 However, it is being said in the political corridors that even as a rich heritage, big organization and hard work, Congress President Rahul Gandhi could not reach the point of politics where many people of gandhi-nehru family before him did not reach, Remained for a rather long time
 sanghathan main chunaav kii parampara shuru kicongress adhyaksh ke taur par unke kareeb 20 maheene ke safar main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan ke chunavi jeet ke taur par badi safaltaaen milin, lekin loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main party kii karaari haar unki naakaami kii badi ibaarat likh gaya
 While president, Rahul Gandhi attempted to change the work culture of the party
 unhone tikat aavanton, sanghathan kii kaaryastylee main paardarshita laane ke liye kadam uthaaya or sanghathan main chunaav karaane kii parampara shuru kii
 Praising the electoral strategy, Rahul, the son of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, caught the attention of the media, public and intellectual class from the beginning of his political innings and first became the party's national vice-president then in Gujarat in December 2017
 Became Congress president
 gujarat ke chunaav main congress bhale hi maamuli antar se haar gai, lekin kai siyaasi jaankaron ne rahul gandhi ke netritv or party kii chunavi ranneeti kii tarif kii
 After Rahul Gandhi became the president, the Congress lost in the Karnataka assembly elections in 2018, then the victory of Congress in the assembly elections of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in 2018 served to increase the confidence of the party workers under his leadership
 amethi se mila doharaa jhatkamadhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main congress kii jeet se utsahit rahul gandhi ko laga ki 2019 ke chunaav main centre kii satta main bhi vaapasi hogi, lekin piem narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi kii badi jeet ne unki ummiido par pani pher diya
 Rahul's loss to his traditional Amethi seat dealt him a double whammy
 loksabhaa chunaav main mukhya vipakshi party ke niraashajanak pradarshan kii sthiti yah he ki vah 2014 ke apane 44 siton ke aankadon main mahaj kuch siton kii badhotaree kar pai or use 52 siten milin
 According to the news agency PTI, many experts before the election and also during the election said that if the Congress even scored a century on seats, it would be a comfortable situation for him and party president Rahul Gandhi
 nyaay kii guarantee par phiraa panirahul gandhi ne rafel mudde ke alaava nunatam aay guarantee (nyaay) yojana ko shandaar tareeke se pesh kiya
 The Congress party hoped that its promise of giving Rs 6,000 per month to the poor would tarnish the debate of bjp's nationalism, but in reality nothing of the sort happened
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari shikast ke baad 25 may ko hui party kaarysmiti kii baithak main rahul gandhi ne party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Rejecting his resignation at that time, the CWC authorized him to make a radical change in the party, although Rahul Gandhi remained firm on his stand and made it clear that neither he nor any other member of the Gandhi family would take over this responsibility
 
 vaise, rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha he ki vah adhyaksh nahin rahete hue bhi party ke liye sakriyata se kaam karte rahenge

 mere mere aage aayaa or kaha-apane haath dikhaaiye

 After success in cricket, life has not been the same for Virat
 ve apni manmarjee se sadak par nahin gum sakate
 Going out for dinner was no less a problem for him
 viraat ke anusaar, aise main ve desh ke baahar rahete hue ghoomane-phirane kaa puraa anand lete hai
 In cities like Melbourne, London, they go out for a walk with headphones because they know that there is no crowd of fans and journalists to chase them here
 (padhein, sachin ke drink ke ofer par viraat kohli ne diya tha yah jawaab) While on the cricket field, the expectations of more than one billion fans are on him
 soshal media par unke folbers kii sankhya din-pratidin record banaati ja rahi he
 After the departure of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag and MS Dhoni (test Cricket), Virat is probably the only cricketer from Team India who holds superstar status
 viraat ne won ko bataaya, 'shuru main mujhe is staradam ko sanbhaalane main sangharsh karnaa padaa
 In this country people like to compare
 maine acha karnaa shuru kiya to logon ne meri (tendulkar se) tulana shuru kar di lekin main ise ek saamaanya baat ke taur par letaa hum

 imran hashmi kii film da body kaa trailor relies ho chukaa he
 In this suspense thriller film, Emraan is working with actors like Rishi Kapoor and Shobhita
 haalanki film main ek seen aisa he jiske chalate imran zarurhairan honge
 Actually, in the trailer of the film, it can be seen that what they are doing to South Indian actress Vedika
 is film ke saath hi vedika apane bollywood kariyar kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi hai
 However, some time ago during his film 'why Cheat India', Imran said that he has moved beyond the image of serial kisser and his character has completely finished
 kuch samay pehle imran ne kaha tha ki ve apni serial kisar kii image ko gambhirtha se nahin lete hai
 He had said, 'you call me something else, call it a bad boy or a serial killer, but don't say serial killer
 maine kabhi bhi is image ko syriasli nahin liya
 This is the perception of the public, the honor given by the media
 meraa kaam he filmon main kaam karnaa or main vahi karata hum
 'imran had said that in the era of new-age cinema, instead of serial kisser, he said that' i have worked on gray characters more than serial kisser
 murder, jehar, jananath, aawaaraapan ke samay vaala imran hashmi ab mar chukaa he
 It was a different time in my life
 ab main apane jivan ke anubhavon ke saath bahut aage bad gaya hum
 During this time i was married and had a son
 ek samay tha jab us tarah kii filmein khub chal rahi thim, isliye main unheen filmon main kaam karata tha
 Now i have become a producer, now films are going on different topics, new experiments are also being done in cinema
 ab vah samay nahin rahaa, jab film main 5 gane or thodaa ection daal diya to film chal jaaegi

 'do justice to me and my brother
 nayaa paan singh tomars banane ke liye mujhe bandook chalaane kii training lene kii zarurat nahin padegi
 'this threat is to bring justice to his younger brother, who had lost 80% of his sight in an attack by private security guards at a Hanuwantia water tourist spot in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh, and against the alleged inaction of the police in the case on the indo-tibetan border
 Police (ITBP) Havildar Amit Singh has given it through Facebook post
 unhone kaha ki unke parijan 16 agast ko khandwa jile ke indira sagar baandh ke paas empi tourism ke jal paryaton sthal hanuvantiya tapu par picnic manaane gaye the
 Where he had a dispute with private security guards for not allowing him to carry milk bottles and biscuits for children
 baat badi to vahaan tainaat guard charan singh gond or duusare suraksha gardon ne unke parivaar par eent, lathi or yahaan tak ki bear kii botalon se bhi hamalaa kiya
 Amit alleged "the security guards, especially my brother Atul Singh, attacked him in the head with a beer bottle and one of the stones he threw hurt his right eye, causing 80% of that eye injury
" Lost sight "indore main doctoron ne jahaan mere ghayal bhai atul kaa ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he, hamen sujan vaali dahini aankh kii 80% drushti waapas laane ke liye use chennai le jane ke liye kaha he
 Instead of helping us, the police registered a complaint against only two guards and 15 unidentified guards and sailors under the sections of the ordinary IPC on our complaint related to disorderly behavior, physical assault and criminal intimidation and not for murder due to serious injury
 a case of attempt was registered
 unhone ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki " suraksha guard ek sattarudh congress ke netaa ke kareebi rishtedaar dwaara chalaae ja rahe ek suraksha agency se the, isliye police ne bhi hamaare khilaaf hamalaa karne waalon or hamaari bahanon ke saath durvyavhaar karne waalon kii shikaayat par samaan ipisi kii dhaaraon main hamaare khilaaf maamla darj kiya
 Confirming the violent incident of August 16 on Hanuwantia Island, Amit Pawar, in-charge of Mundi Police Station said, "the two groups clashed with each other, during which one of the family members suffered serious wounds to his eye
" chunki mundi (khandwa) main sarkari swasthya suvidha main doctoron ne shuru main ise saadhaaran chot mana
 So in this case we had registered similar sections of IPC, once we get new medico legal report from doctors in Indore, we will add more sections in the FIR
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii shakhsiyat ko kareeb se jaanane vaale jaanate hai ki aam janata ke bich jo unki chhavi he, vah usase ekadam ulat hai
 Rahul Gandhi has a special place in the heart for Dalits
 vah barabari kii baat karte hai, gaiyr siyaasi logon ko siyaayat main aage laane kii vakaalat karte hai, raajnneeti se paisa banane waalon ko pasand nahin karte or siyasat main jhooth bolnaa gunaah maanate hai
 Rahul Gandhi is in favor of fulfilling responsibility in politics
 vanshavaad rahul ko bhaataa nahin, garib ko aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 Want accountability
 party main loktantr chaahate hai, isliye enesayuai or youth congress main chunaav karavaate hai or 2014 main loksabhaa tikat ke liye ummidavaaron ke bich chunaav karaane kaa payalat project laate hai
 All these things are such, which it seems to know that such a man would like India
 phir siyasat main rahul asafal kyon dikhte hai? siyaasi dharaatal par rahul ke formule kyon dhadaam ho jate hai? aakhir kyon adarshavaad jamini hakeekat ke saamne dam tod detaa he? congress ke netaa jo khulkar nahin kah pate uski tafasil se padtaal karne par 10 badi baaten saamne aati hai
 1
 party main loktantr kii baat karne vaale rahul gandhi jab enesayuai, youth congress or party ke ummidavaar ke liye chunaav karaate hai to vipakshi party se ladaai ladane se pehle hi party ke bheetar kii ladaai party ko kamjor kar detii he
 Therefore, the weak condition of NSUI and Youth Congress is not hidden from anyone
 2
 Advocacy of bringing non-political people into politics comes to the fore when Rahul Gandhi prefers them in political decisions
 jaise party ke netaaon kii salaah to lee jaati he lekin rosemara ke siyaasi faislon main rahul ke pie kii bhoomika main rahane vaale gaiyr siyaasi log prabhaavshaalee ho jate hai, phir jab maamla bigadataa he to netaaon ko sanbhaalane kaa jimmaa diya jaataa he
 3
 rahul gandhi netaaon se baithkon main or reliyon main milte hai, lekin unka uthanaa baithna, yatra karnaa sab apane pie jaise logon ke saath hota he
 Rahul's PA has Kaushal, Alankar, Sachin Rao, Nikhil Alva and K
 Raju from the administrative services
 jo videshon se behatar shiksha lekar aae hai
 Humans are also better, but they are far from political sensibility and ground reality, but Rahul's favorites
 udhaaharan ke taur par loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarikhon se pehle tak media kii jimmedaari randeep surajevaala ke kandhon par thi, lekin chunaavon ke dauraan rahul ke saakshaatkaar kaa jimmaa nikhil alva ko saunp diya gaya
 Nikhil suddenly got such a big task, understand his understanding that he got Rahul to interview Hafiz Saeed with a very anti-congress channel
 aisa hi udhaaharan amethi kaa he, jahaan rahul gandhi ne saal 2009 ke baad sonia gandhi kii team kii chuttee karke apni team banaai
 The 2014 elections finally forced Sonia's team to win and somehow won, but Team Rahul also dipped Rahul's lutia in Amethi in 2019
 4
 Rahul also believes strongly on professionals and data
 lekin congress vichaardhaara shaayad peeche chhot jaati he
 Be it close to Rahul or under Rahul's influence, Congress data department chairman Pravin Chakraborty kept telling Rahul that Modi will not be able to get that arithmetic in any way, so that he can become PM again
 rahul bhi un par aankh moond kar bharosa karte gaye or pehle of record phir khulkar yahi bolne bhi lage
 In fact, Rahul started walking like that with heart
 data vibhaag ne shakti ap ke jariye jo booth level ke aankade die, uske aadhaar par jo parinaamon kaa anumaan lagaaya sab uske ulat rahaa
 5
 rahul ke daftar main jo pie logon kii team he, mana jaataa he ki sabhi nahin par zyaadaatar vampanthi soch ke hai
 Therefore, Rahul's visit to the temple, an attempt to break the image of the Pro Muslim Party, was possible when he suffered a bad defeat in 2014
 congress netaaon ke dabaav ke chalate aakhirkaar ye sambhav ho paaya
 Therefore, the party leaders say that Rahul should adopt the secularism of Indira Gandhi and not the Left
 varanaa jo haal vampanthi raajnneeti kaa hua, vahi congress kaa ho jayega
 By the way, not only Khali Rahul, who plays the role of Priyanka Gandhi's PA is also the leftist Sandeep Singh who comes from JNU, who is said to have shown black flags to Manmohan Singh as PM
 congress netaaon kaa maananaa he ki rahul beshak yuvaaon ko apane saath rakhen lekin wo rajnatik hone chahie

 adarshavaad or siyaasi hakeekat main rahul gandhi ne akasar adarshavaad ko chunaa, jiskaa khamiyaja party ko uthaanaa padaa
 Idealism is that someone who is money-able, capable and has status simply because he cannot be a good leader and he who shows good fortune or simplicity can be a better leader
 udhaaharan ke taur par madhusudan mistre, deepak baavariyaa, jaise netaa rahul ko pasand hai
 These questions have already been raised by Milind Deora, close to Rahul
 7
 a big question comes up and Rahul is in favor of bringing down Dalit, underprivileged, poor leaders under him, but when it comes to friendship, most of the big leaders are either sons or daughters or raja-maharaja
 udhaaharan ke taur par milind devda, maharaj jitendra singh, maharaj jyotiraditya sindhiya, sachin payalat, umr abdulla, vagairah vagairah
 8
 rahul or unki team angrejidan he
 Things are fixed in English
 angreji main sochi jaati hai phir jarurat ke hisaab se uskaa hindikaran hota he
 Its brunt is in the politics of the Hindi belt
 yahaan tak ki bade netaa bhi isko bhaanpate hue koshish main rahete hai ki uski khabar yaa baat kisi angreji platform par aa jaae, bhale hi uski tiarapy yaa cirkulation bahut kam hi kyon naa ho? usko lagata he uski baat alaakaman tak aise hi pahonchegi
 Then he does not take care of general public or Hindi belt
 9
 Congress leaders believe that Rahul expresses his dislike towards leaders
 jabaki adhyaksh ko apni pasand naapsand ko jaahir naa karte hue sabaki pratibha ke hisaab se kaam lenaa chahie
 Also, those who like them become more kind to them
 masalan, kabhi benny prasad verma ko pasand kiya to un par lagaataar meharbaan rahe, phir rajbabbar or piel puniya par
 After losing in 2014, he was given a Rajya Sabha seat, made Raj Babbar the UP president, then Moradabad first and then gave him the freedom to choose Fatehpur Sikri seat
 piel puniya khud rajyasabha saansad bane or unke bete ko loksabhaa tikat mila
 At the same time, Nana Patole, who came from BJP to Congress, was first made the president of Kisan Congress and then got a ticket from Nagpur
 10
 Rahul's team is not political, so Rahul cannot get the right feedback to catch the issues and his success or failure on the ground
 jaise- chaukeedaar chor he, jameen par nahin chal rahaa tha
 Due to the enthusiasm and energy of Rahul, the voice was echoed in Congress rallies, which Rahul was considering success
 vahiin balakot jaise muddon par congress pichad rahi thi
 Rahul or his team could not even think of it
 saath hi sam pitroda or manishankar ayyar jaise gandhi parivaar ke kareebi netaaon ke bayaan party ko nuksaan dete rahe
 But Rahul remained poor
 captain amarinder ke mukaable siddhu ko tarjeeh di jaati rahi, jinke bayaan party ko lagaataar nuksaan dete rahe
 Party leaders believe that they cannot have a president without Rahul Gandhi
 gandhi parivaar hi wo chumbak he, jo party ko jodakar rakh saktaa he
 In childhood, Rahul himself saw his grandmother riddled with bullets with the same hands with which he used to play badminton
 javaani kii dahalij par apane pita kaa aatankwaad se ladate kshat vikshat shav dekha
 In such a situation, there will be both influence and pressure on his personality
 aise main modi se mukaable ke liye hamako rahul hi chahie, bas thodaa badla hua
 Then there is victory next to defeat

 Also, the CBI has been asked to complete the investigation of the victim's accident case in seven days and submit a report
 iske alaava sarkaar se peedita ko fouran 25 lakh rupee muaavja dene ko kaha he
 This is not the first time the Supreme Court has given a historic order
 kareeb 40 saal pehle hussainara khatun banaam bihar grih sachiv maamle main supreme court ne aitihaasik faisla sunaaya tha
 In this, the top court ordered the immediate release of 40 thousand prisoners lodged in the jails of the country
 is maamle ke baad se desh main janhit yachika yani piiel kaa chalan aayaa
 Under this, if the fundamental rights of any person are violated and they cannot file a case in court due to poverty or illiteracy, then they can send a post card or letter to the Supreme Court
 agar supreme court ko lagata he ki post card yaa chitthee likhane vaale vyakti ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hua he, to wo isko piiel maanakar sangyaan le saktaa he
 The credit for making justice easier for the common man thus goes to former Chief Justice PN Bhagwati
 saal 1979 main supreme court ke tatkaaleen justise bhagwati ne hussainara khatun maamle main sunwaayee karte hue kaha tha ki samvidhan main sabhi ko garima ke saath jivan jeene kaa moulik adhikaar diya gaya he
 No one can be denied justice due to poverty or illiteracy
 jab supreme court ke saamne hussainara khatun maamla aayaa, to wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 It was said that several thousand prisoners are lodged in jails of Bihar for a long time
 inke maamle main na chargeshit daayar kii gai he or na hi trial shuru kiya gaya he
 The crimes for which these prisoners have been put in jail, they have been in jail for more time than the punishment given on proving that crime
 iske baad supreme court ne bihar sarkaar ko talab kiya tha
 On this, the Bihar government said that these prisoners are neither able to advocate nor are able to give bail amount, due to which the hearing of their case is not going ahead
 haalanki supreme court ne bihar sarkaar kii is daleel ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 In this case, prisoners in Bihar jail were advocated by Advocate Pushpa Kapila Hingorani
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki agar kisi vyakti ko kisi aarope main giraftaar kiya jaataa he, to usko us aparaadh ke liye nirdhaarit sajaa se zyada samay tak kisi bhi haalat main jail main band nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If this is done, the fundamental rights found in Article 21 of that person are violated
 lau professor dow rajesh dube kaa kahana he ki moulik adhikaron ke hanan par sabhi ko anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court kaa rukh karne kaa adhikaar he
 Apart from this, the High Court can be moved under Article 226 to protect fundamental rights

 Surya has been called 'sarvati Sakshi Bhootham' (the observer of everything)
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki surya bhagwaan har kriyalap ke sakshi hai or surya kii upasna nahin karne vaale logon se bhagwaan rusht ho jate hai
 Therefore, the Sun God can be pleased by helping someone or by performing auspicious deeds, but if you chant these mantras while worshiping, you will get desired results
 agar surya bhagwaan ko prasann karne or manovanchit fal paane ke liye kuch mantron kaa jaap karnaa chahie
 Chanting Surya Mantra is very easy
 iskaa jaap karne kaa sabase sahi samay suryoday he
 These mantras can be chanted with different 12 postures
 uun mitray nam:uun ravaye nam:uun suryaay nam:uun bhaanve nam:uun pushne nam:uun marichaaye nam:uun adityay nam:uun bhashkaraay nam:uun arqy nam:uun khagaye nam:kai vrath-tyohaar bhagwaan surya ko samarpit hai
 Lord Surya is worshiped in Makar Sankranti, Rath Saptami, Chhath and Samba Dashami
 surya mantra ke labhbhagwan surya ko aatma kaa hissaa mana jaataa he
 Offering arghya while chanting the sun mantra is also auspicious
 isse swasthya laabh bhi hota he
 Chanting the Surya Mantra on a regular basis brings energy into the body
 
 The Sun God should offer Arghya 7 times while chanting
 agar aap or zyada shubh fal kii prapti chaahate hai to aapako laal rang ke vastra dhaaran karne chahie
 What the Rigveda says - According to the Rigveda, all the tasks of a person who is up at sunrise are completed
 brahmad ke sabhi jeev or chijen surya par ashrith hai
 The Sun removes all physical, mental and spiritual disorders
 surya ke 7 rangon kaa khaas mahatv he
 Chanting Surya Mantra helps in getting the energy of these colors
 surya mantra ke jaap se buddhi badhaane main bhi madad milti he
 How to give arghya - Fill water in a copper vessel, add red sandalwood, kumkum and red colored flowers in it
 suryoday ke samay purv kii disha main munh karke arghya den
 It would be better if you offer water to the root of a plant while offering arghya to the sun
 apane sir kii oonchai ke baraabar tambe ke paatr ko le jaakar surya mantra kaa jaap karen
 Amidst increasing incidents of mob lynching, 49 celebrities of the film world have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 letters main desh main bheed dwaara linching ke badhate chalan par gahari chintaa vyakt kii gai he
 The letter to PM Modi has signatures of celebrities like Mani Ratnam, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ramchandra Guha, Anurag Kashyap
 unhone piem modi se ek aisa maahaul banane kii maang kii he, jahaan asahmati ko kuchlaa nahin jaae
 These celebrities have said that disagreement makes the country more powerful
 is patr main likhaa he ki hamaara samvidhan bharat ko ek secular ganatantr bataata he, jahaan har dharm, samooh, ling, jati ke logon ke baraabar adhikaar hai
 The letter has demanded that the lynchings of Muslims, Dalits and other minorities be stopped immediately
 patr main neshnal krime record beuro ke aankadon ke aadhaar par kaha he gaya he ki 1 janvari 2009 se lekar 29 oktober 2018 ke bich dharm kii pahchaan par aadhaarit 254 aparaadh darj kiye gaye, is dauraan 91 logon kii hatya hui or 579 log ghayal hue
 Read this too: 'murder' can be involved in mob lynching, know how strict the law and according to the Supreme Court, Muslims who constitute 14% of the population of India are victims of 62% of such crimes, while Christians, who have population The share is 2 per cent
 They were victims of 14 per cent of such crimes
 patr main kaha gaya he ki aise 90 fisadi aparaadh may 2014 ke baad hua tha, jab narendra modi satta main aae the
 It has been written in the letter that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has criticized the incidents of lynchings in Parliament, but this is not enough
 patr main likhaa gaya he, "aisa jurm karne waalon ke khilaaf kya kadam uthaaya gaya he, hamen aisa mahasoos karte hai ki aise aparaadhon ko gaiyr jamaanti banaaya jaae, or doshiyon ko aisi sajaa di jaae jo nazeer ban jaae
 When the perpetrators of murder can be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, then why can't this happen in the case of lynching, which is an even more hate crime? No citizen of our country needs to live in fear and awe! ”this paper strongly advocates disagreement in democracy and states that without dissent, it cannot thrive
 agar koi sarkaar ke khilaaf raay detaa he to use 'anti-neshnal' yaa 'urban naksal' ghoshit nahin kar diya janaa chahie
 Criticizing the ruling party does not mean criticizing the country
 koi bhi party jab satta main he to wo dal desh kaa pratik nahin ban jaataa he, ye desh kii kai partiyon main se maatr ek party hi he
 Therefore, speaking against the government or taking a stand is not the same as expressing anti-national sentiments
