 There are all old newspapers
 internet par maujuud hai
 Birth of India Freedom, Nation Wakes to New Life
 mistar nehru kals for big efort fram pipal
 India Independent, British Rule Ends
 tu dominions aar bourn
 Such headlines are for the newspapers of that day
 jetali ji kii baat sahi he ki 15 agast ke din azaadi kii hi surkhiyaan hai
 Newspapers have made big headlines on 9 November 2016, as it was printed in the daily newspapers of 15 August
 pehle do teen dinon tak balki usase aage tak media main notebandi ko lekar utsahvardhak khabaron kii maatra adhik thi
 All the big industrialists were and are praising this decision
 jab bank khule or logon ko cash nahin mila to samasyaayein badhane lagi
 The news of these problems also improved the speed of decision making by the government
 in khabaron main yahi tha ki paise nahin mil rahe hai
 Very few were criticizing that the government took the wrong decision
 ye kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye bahut badi uplabdhi he
 Let's ask one more question
 jab desh azaadi ke jashn main duba hua tha tab gandhi ji kya kar rahe the
 Was he with the motive of independence or with the suffering of the people
 
 
 15 agast 1947 ke rose gandhi nai dilli main nahin the
 Gandhi reached Calcutta on August 9, which is now called Kolkata
 kolkata se ve aaj ke bangladesh main maujuud noakhli gaye or vahaan se laut kar bihar aae, phir sintabar maheene main dilli aae
 If the riots in Delhi did not stop in January 1948, they went on a fast unto death
 kalakatta main dange ho rahe the or gandhi un dangon ko shant karne pahunche the
 Gandhi refused to participate in any kind of celebration
 unhone kaha tha ki main 15 agast kii kushi nahin manaa saktaa hum
 i can't cheat you lekin main yah bhi nahin kahuunga ki aap jashn na manaayen
 Unfortunately, the freedom we have got has seeds of confrontation between India and Pakistan of the future
 vahaan gandhi waapas jaao ke naare lagate, magar phir bhi ve prarthana sabha kar rahe the, hindu muslim dangon main pagal ho chuke logon ko shant karne unhen phir se insaan banane main lage the
 When the movement he led for 31 years between 1916 and 1947, when that movement reached the destination of independence, Gandhi got away from that celebration
 unki koshish kaamyaab hui
 In a few days, the rioting boom began to calm down
 lard mountbeton ne kaha tha ki punjab main 55 hazaar sainik tainaat the phir bhi vahaan bade paimaane par dange hote rahe
 There was only one soldier in Bengal, the riots stopped there
 gandhi ke is prasang se jetali ji ko kuch jawaab mil saktaa he
 On 15 August, while Nehru was reading his historical speech in English, Gandhi was declaring a fast
 charkha chalaa rahe the
 Were praying aaj ke daur main media vishwasaneeyata ke ghor sankat se guzar rahaa he, uski saakh kii vaapasi ke asaar dinon din kam hote ja rahe hai
 Major leaders of all political parties are becoming intolerant of criticism
 media sarkaar kii baat kare yaa janata kii baat kare, yaa uskaa santulan kaisaa ho, yah ek chunauti kaa kaam he
 What answer should be given to the people who say that the media only talks about the government, what to say to the government which feels that it is not being done
 phir se gandhi ji kaa sahaara letaa hum
 After 15 August 12 November 1947 also came
 is din mahatma gandhi pehali baar aal india radio ke studio main pahunche
 Gandhi addressed the radio for the first and last time
 gandhi ji ko kurukshetra janaa tha jahaan ve pakistan se aae do lakh sharnaarthiyon ko sambodhit karnaa chaahate the
 There too people were excited that if Gandhiji comes, he will meet him and tell his pain
 lekin tabhi ghoshnaa hui ki kuch kaarnon se gandhi kurukshetra nahin jaaenge or aal india radio se sambodhit karenge
 Murphy radio was placed on the table in Kurukshetra's camp

 Rose Gandhi was not in New Delhi on 15 August 1947
 gandhi ji 9 agast ko hi kalakatta pahunch gaye the jise aaj kolkata kehete hai
 From Kolkata, he went to Noakhali in present-day Bangladesh and returned from there to Bihar, then to Delhi in the month of September
 janvari 1948 main dilli ke dange nahin ruke to aamaran anshan par baith gaye
 Riots were taking place in Calcutta and Gandhi arrived to calm those riots
 gandhi ne kisi bhi tarah ke jashn main shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 He had said that i cannot celebrate 15 August
 main aapako dhokhaa nahin de saktaa
 But i also would not say that you do not celebrate
 durbhaagya se jo azaadi hamen mili he usamen bhavishya ke bharat or pakistan ke bich takaraav ke beej hai
 There, Gandhi would go back to shouting slogans, but still he was having a prayer meeting, Hindu Muslims were engaged in making them human again to pacify those who had gone mad in the riots
 1916 se 1947 ke bich 31 saal tak jis andolan kaa netritv kiya, jab wo andolan azaadi kii manzil par pahunchaa to gandhi us jashn se dur ho gaye
 His effort was successful
 thode hi dinon main dangon kaa ufaan shant hone laga
 Lord Mountbatten had said that 55 thousand soldiers were stationed in Punjab, yet large scale riots continued
 bengal main ek hi sipaahi tha vahaan dange ruuk gaye
 Jaitley can get some answers from this incident of Gandhi
 15 agast ko jab nehru apana aitihaasik bhaashan angrezi main pard rahe the, gandhi upwas kaa elaan kar rahe the
 He was driving a spinning wheel
 prarthana kar rahe the
 In today's era, the media is going through a grave crisis of credibility, the chances of its return to credit are becoming less and less
 tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke bade netaa aalochanaon ko lekar asahansheel hote ja rahe hai
 It is a challenge for the media to talk about the government or the public, or how to balance it
 us janata ko kya jawaab diya jaae jo kahati he ki media sirf sarkaar kii baat karti he, us sarkaar se kya kaha jaae jise lagata he ki uski baat ho hi nahin rahi he
 i again take recourse to Gandhiji
 15 agast ke baad 12 november 1947 bhi aayaa
 On this day, Mahatma Gandhi arrived at All India Radio's studio for the first time
 gandhi ne pehali baar or aakhri baar radio se sambodhan kiya
 Gandhiji had to go to Kurukshetra where he wanted to address two lakh refugees from Pakistan
 vahaan bhi log utsahit the ki gandhi ji aaenge to unase milakar apni pidaa bataayenge
 But then it was announced that Gandhi would not go to Kurukshetra for some reason and would address All India Radio
 kurukshetra ke camp main teble par murphi radio rakhaa gaya
 a loudspeaker was placed in front of him so that Gandhi's voice could reach everyone
 lage ki gandhi ji hi bol rahe hai, isliye unki tasviir bhi rakh di gai
 Gandhi did not use radio to celebrate independence
 balki hinsa or palaayan ke shikaar logon kii pidaa ko sukun dene ke liye kiya
 That's why November 12 is celebrated as Mass Broadcasting Day
 8 november ko notebandi hui
 Four days later, on 12 November, Mass Broadcasting Day was celebrated at India International Center in Delhi
 us vakt gandhi radio ko lekar aashwast nahin the
 In the second world war, radio was used more for propaganda
 hitler kaa zikr karnaa thik nahin kyonki hitler kaa naam aate hi hamaari raajnneetik bahasein sadakchhaap ho jaati hai
 Gandhi did not consider radio necessary
 unhen lagata tha ki logon ke bich jaakar baat karnaa hi behatar he
 They did not want the effect of radio to increase so much that the machine becomes large and the person becomes small
 kahin aaj ye to nahin ho gaya he ki channel bade ho gaye hai, lakhon karodon log peeche rah gaye hai
 The man is reduced
 jaise ankar maseehaa ho gaya he, reporter or uski khabaren dhuaan dhuaan
 The news of common people is missing
 bade netaaon ke bhaashan par bahasein hai
 However, in the year of 1947, radio did a very useful job of reuniting the missing people
 gumshuda logon kii jaankariyaan khub prasaarit hoti thim
 People are upset that the finance minister can only have the facility to call it a reality of life
 lagaataar cash kaa aashwaasan diya ja rahaa he lekin logon kaa anubhav bainkon ke paas jaakar vaisaa nahin he
 There are no queues just in front of the banks
 bahut si aisi kahaniyaan hai jo darj honi chahie
 If according to Jaitley ji, these fifty days of demonetisation are like the moments of independence, then the stories hidden in these queues can be recorded in the same way as the newspapers of that time during the months before and after independence
 bainkon ke aage kataron kii kahaniyon se sarkaar ko bhi madad mila
 This is reflected in his decisions
 hamaare sahyogi saurabh shukla kii mulaakaat hiradevi se hui
 Coming to Delhi from Agra, Hiradevi works in two or three houses
 umr ke kaaran itnaa hi kar sakati hai
 Cash is available from every household
 hiradevi ko aaj kisi ghar se selary nahin mili
 The same answer was received after a week
 sau do sau karke le lenaa
 You will not get all the money right now
 ve log bhi rose bank kii line main lag kar aa ja rahe hai
 When they will not get the money, then from where will they give us? hiradevi kii haalat karaab he
 We did not go to her house but believe that she must be speaking right
 unhone kaha ki unke apane ghar kaa rashan khatm hone ke kagaar par he
 November has somehow passed since the 8th, but the beginning of December disappoints
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki netaa or media vaale nahin badale, iske alaava desh main sab badal gaya
 They are right
 vaise desh main sab badal gaya, ye bhi sahi he
 However, the government's decision on the five hundred note changed many times from November 8 to December 1
 2 disambar kii aadhi raat se 500 ke note petrol pump,gas kii dukaanon main nahin liye jaayenge
 Earlier, its date was December 15
 lekin 15 taarikh tak aap 500 ke puraane note se bas or rail kaa tikat kharid sakate hai
 On the toll of the National Highway, you can give old notes of 500 from 3 to 15 December
 ab aapako vahaan free suvidha nahin milegi
 Now come to another news kya sarkari adhikari apane maatahaton kaa istemaal kar rahe hai note badalawaane ke liye
 a similar case has come up in DTC in Delhi which is being investigated
 haryana roadways ke darjanon conduktaron ne apane adhikariyon par is baat kaa aarope lagaaya he ki un par dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he ki puraane note ke badale sau sau ke note laakar den jo yatriyon se mil rahe hai
 This report has been sent by our colleague Harikishan
 dilli ke kashmiri get vaali aiesabiti main haryana roadways kii zyaadaatar basen khadi kar di gayi
 The conductors of the buses going to Haryana parked the buses
 dharne par baith gaye
 They allege that Sunder, a 25-year-old youth aide, died of a heart attack as a flying squad officer searched Sunder's clothes to search the cash
 isse apamaanit sundar kii haalat bighad gai
 This is the charge of the conductors
 conductor sirf aarope nahin laga rahe balki aisi baaten kah rahe hai jis par sarkaar ko turant dhyaan dena chahie
 The conductors are telling that this kind of action is actually done to pressure them, the officers give the conductors daily up to ten fifteen or twenty thousand rupees in the notes of five hundred and thousand which till evening they will be returned in hundred hundred notes Have to do
 aiesabiti par do tarah ke counter hai ek to jahaan tikat katate hai or duusare jahaan tikaton kii advance booking hoti he
 The Transport Minister of Haryana acceded to the conductors and the dharna ended before the prime time began
 sundar ko das lakh kaa muawza bhi dene kaa elaan hua he
 The comments sarkaar ne kaha he ki kaala dhan ke khilaaf uskaa abhiyaan notebandi tak nahin rukegaa
 If a lot of rumors were being spread about gold, then the government has kept the matter on its side
 bataaya gaya he ki inakam tex kanoon main kiye sanshodhan main pushtaini gahanon yaa sone kii aisi julri par tex nahin lagegaa jo ghoshit aay yaa declared inakam se kharidi gai he
 Actually there were rumors that after the new income tax bill, the gold kept in the house would also come under scrutiny and it could be confiscated during the raid
 in galat fahemiyon ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki pushtaini gahanon par koi tex lagane kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 There will be no tax on gold purchased from declared income
 chapa padane kii haalat main vivaahit mahila se 500 gram sone tak koi poochtacha nahin hogi
 Similarly, unmarried women can keep 250 grams of gold
 purush 100 gram tak sona rakh sakenge
 It is very difficult to tell what the story of the people standing in front of the banks will be
 ek bujurg subah 11 baje se qatari main khadey rahe
 Even after four hours, when no money was received, the body of the wife is lying in the house, there is no money for the funeral, but the bankers are not allowed to go inside so they are standing in the line
 maamle kii gambhirtha dekar ek or koshish kii gai, bujurg paisa lekar apane ghar kii taraf daud padate hai, ek shaq bhi hota he kahin ye jhooth to nahin, camera us bujurg kaa ghar tak peechha karata he jahaan maut kaa matam he, itani der main duusare log kisi tarah sanskaar kar chuke the
 The death was diagnosed with cancer and there was no money in the house
 gandhi ke is prasang se jetali ji ko kuch jawaab mil saktaa he
 On 15 August, while Nehru was reading his historical speech in English, Gandhi was declaring a fast
 charkha chalaa rahe the
 Were praying aaj ke daur main media vishwasaneeyata ke ghor sankat se guzar rahaa he, uski saakh kii vaapasi ke asaar dinon din kam hote ja rahe hai
 Major leaders of all political parties are becoming intolerant of criticism
 media sarkaar kii baat kare yaa janata kii baat kare, yaa uskaa santulan kaisaa ho, yah ek chunauti kaa kaam he
 What answer should be given to the people who say that the media only talks about the government, what to say to the government which feels that it is not being done
 phir se gandhi ji kaa sahaara letaa hum
 After 15 August 12 November 1947 also came
 is din mahatma gandhi pehali baar aal india radio ke studio main pahunche
 Gandhi addressed the radio for the first and last time
 gandhi ji ko kurukshetra janaa tha jahaan ve pakistan se aae do lakh sharnaarthiyon ko sambodhit karnaa chaahate the
 There too people were excited that if Gandhiji comes, he will meet him and tell his pain
 lekin tabhi ghoshnaa hui ki kuch kaarnon se gandhi kurukshetra nahin jaaenge or aal india radio se sambodhit karenge
 Murphy radio was placed on the table in Kurukshetra's camp
 uske saamne laudspikar rakhaa gaya taaki sab tak gandhi kii awaz pahunch sake
 It seemed that Gandhiji was speaking, so his picture was also kept
 gandhi ne radio kaa istemaal azaadi ke jashn ke liye nahin kiya
 Rather to relieve the suffering of the victims of violence and migration
 isi liye 12 november ko jan prasaaran diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Demonetization took place on 8 November
 chaar din baad 12 november ko dilli ke india international centre main jan prasaaran diwas manaaya gaya
 At that time Gandhi was not convinced about radio
 duusare vishwa yuddh main radio kaa istamaal propeganda ke liye zyaada hua tha
 It is not right to mention Hitler because our political debates become roadblocks as soon as Hitler's name comes
 gandhi radio ko zaruri nahin maanate the
 He felt that it is better to go and talk among people
 ve nahin chaahate the ki radio kaa prabhaav itnaa bad jaae ki mashin badi ho jaae or vyakti chota ho jaae
 It has not happened today that the channels have become big, millions of people are left behind
 aadmi chota ho gaya he
 As the anchor becomes the messiah, the reporter and his news smoke smoke
 aam logon kii khabaren gaayab hai
 There are debates on the speech of big leaders
 haalanki 1947 ke saal main radio ne gumshuda logon ko milaane kaa bada upyogi kaam kiya tha
 Information about the missing people was widely circulated
 log pareshaan hai ise sirf jivan kii ek vaastaviktaa kehane kii suvidha vitt mantri ke paas ho sakati he
 Cash is constantly being assured but the experience of the people going to the banks is not the same
 bainkon ke aage sirf kataren nahin hai
 There are many stories that should be recorded
 agar jetali ji ke anusaar notebandi ke ye pachaas din azaadi ke lamhe jaise hai to in kataron main chhipi kahaniyon ko bhi usee tarah darj kiya ja saktaa he jaise azaadi se pehle or baad ke maheenon ke dauraan us vakt ke akhbaaron main darj kiya gaya hoga
 The government was also helped by the stories of queues ahead of the banks
 uske faislon main isaki jhalak milti he
 Our colleague Saurabh Shukla met Hiradevi
 agra se dilli aakar hiradevi do teen gharon main kaam karti hai
 You can only do so much due to age
 har ghar se cash hi miltaa he
 Heera Devi did not get salary from any home today
 yahi jawaab mila ki ek hafte baad le lenaa
 Take one hundred two hundred
 abhi sara paisa nahin milegaa
 Those people are also coming in the bank line everyday
 jab unhen hi paise nahin milenge to hamen kahaan se denge
 Heera Devi's condition is bad
 ham unke ghar to nahin gaye par yakeen karte hai ki wo sahi hi bol rahi hongi
 He said that the ration of his own house is on the verge of ending
 aath taarikh ke baad se november to kisi tarah guzar gaya lekin disambar kii shuruyaat maayoos karti he
 The Finance Minister has said that the leaders and the media did not change, apart from this everything changed in the country
 sahi to kah rahe hai
 Well, everything has changed in the country, this is also true
 vaise paanch sau ke note ko lekar sarkaar kaa faisla 8 november se lekar 1 disambar tak kai baar badal gaya
 From midnight on December 2, 500 notes will not be taken in petrol pumps, gas shops
 pehle isaki taarikh 15 disambar tak thi
 But till the 15th, you can buy bus and rail tickets from the old 500 note
 neshnal haive ke toll par aap 3 se 15 disambar tak 500 ke puraane note de sakate hai
 Now you will not get free facility there
 ab aate hai ek or khabar kii taraf
 Are government officials using their subordinates to exchange notes
 dilli main ditisi main aisa hi maamla aayaa he jisaki jaanch ho rahi he
 Dozens of Haryana Roadways conductors have accused their officials of pressuring them to bring hundred rupees in exchange for old notes which are being received by the passengers
 yah report hamaare sahyogi harikishan ne bheji he
 Most of the Haryana Roadways buses were parked at the ISBT along the Kashmiri Gate in Delhi
 haryana jane vaali bason ke conduktaron ne basen khadi kar deen
 i sat on a dharna
 inkaa aarope he ki 25 saal ke noujvaan sahyogi sundar kii heart atake se maut ho gai kyonki flying squayred officer ne cash kii talaashi ke liye sundar ke kapade utarava kar talaashi lee
 This outraged Sundar's condition
 ye conduktaron kaa aarope he
 Conductors are not just making allegations but are saying such things that the government should take immediate care of
 conductor bataa rahe hai ki darasal is tarah kii karrwai unpar dabaav banane ke liye hoti he, afasar conduktaron ko rojaanaa das pandrah yaa phir bees hajaar tak kii rakam paanch sau or hajaar ke noton main dete hai jinhen shaam tak unhen sau sau ke noton main waapas karnaa hota he
 There are two types of counters on ISBT, one where tickets are cut and the other where advance booking of tickets takes place
 haryana ke parivahan mantri ne conduktaron kii baat maan lee or prime time shuru hone se pehle dharna khatm hua
 a compensation of one million has also been announced to Sundar
 tippaniyan The government has said that its campaign against black money will not stop till demonetisation
 sone ko lekar bahut sari afvaahen failaai ja rahi thim to sarkaar ne apni taraf se baat rakh di he
 It has been said that the amendment to the Income Tax Act will not tax the ancestral ornaments or gold jewelery purchased from declared income or declared income
 darasal aisi afavaahen thi ki nae inakam tex bill ke baad ghar main rakhaa sona bhi jaanch ke daayre main aayega or chaape ke dauraan ye zabt kiya ja saktaa he
 To remove these misgivings, the government has made it clear that there is no provision for taxing ancestral ornaments
 ghoshit aay se khride gaye sone par bhi koi tex nahin lagegaa
 There will be no inquiry up to 500 grams of gold from the married woman in case of raids
 isi tarah avivaahit mahila 250 gram sona rakh sakengi
 Men will be able to keep up to 100 grams of gold
 bainko ke aage qatari main khadey logon main se kiski kahani kya hogi kahana behad mushkil he
 An elder stood in queue since 11 am
 chaar ghante baad bhi jab paise nahin mili to bataaya ghar main patni kaa shav padaa he, antim sanskaar ke paise nahin he lekin bankwale bheetar nahin jane de rahe to line main khadey hai
 Another attempt was made by giving seriousness to the matter, the elders run towards their house with money, there is a doubt that this is not a lie, the camera chases the elderly to the house where there is a mourning of death, in so long Others had cremated in some way
 pataa chalaa maut cancer se hui thi or ghar main paise nahin the

 It has won 104 out of 222 seats and is 8 seats away from the majority mark
 jiske chalate karnataka main sarkaar banane ke uske iraade par philhal brake laga najar aa rahaa he, kyonki congress or jedies ne milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar diya he or iske liye unke paas paryaapt seat sankhya bhi maujuud he
 In such a situation, this difference of eight seats has become a headache for the BJP
 chunaav nateezon kaa vishleshan karen to uske aath ummidavaar congress se bahut hi kam antar se haare hai
 1
 badami sitcongress ke siddharmaiya ne yahaan jeet darj kii he
 He has got a total of 67599, while his opponent B
 shriramulu ko 65903 vot praapt hue hai
 Accordingly, Siddaramaiah won by a narrow margin of just 1696 votes
 2
 Pratap Gowda Patil contested on this seat in Maski seat Rairachud district from Congress and got 60387 votes
 jabaki unke pratidwandi bijepi pratyaashee basvanagauda turavihaal ko 60174 vot mili
 BJP lost this seat by just 213 votes
 3
 This seat in Kundgol seat Dharwad district has also become an obstacle for BJP
 yahaan se bijepi ummidavaar ko 64237 vot mili hai, jabaki congress pratyaashee ko 64871 mat mili
 BJP lost the seat by a margin of 634 votes
 4
 The Congress candidate has got 77699 votes in Gadag seat, while BJP candidate has managed to get 75831 votes
 is hisaab se congress ne bijepi ko yah seat 1868 voton se haraa di he
 5
 hirekerur sitis seat par bhi kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mili he
 From here, Congress candidate Basavanagowda Patil has got 72461 votes, while BJP candidate Ujneshwara Banakar has got 71906 votes
 yani is seat par jeet kaa antar mahaj 555 rahaa he
 6

 vijay nagar sitis seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar ech
 Ravindra got 70578 votes, while Congress candidate M
 krishnappa ko 73353 mat praapt hue
 In this sense, the Congress candidate defeated his BJP rival by 2775 votes
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar in siton par bijepi ke paksh main thodaa matdaan or ho jaataa he tokarnataka kii siyaasi taswirkuch or hi hoti
 In fact, in a big election like assembly, the victory or defeat within a thousand or two thousand votes is considered very low and it is also seen to be related to the luck of the candidate

 pashchim bengal kii raajnneeti main ab tak mukhya dhara se dur rahi bhaajapa ne abhi abhi sampann loksabhaa chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan kiya he or party kii najar rajya ke raajnneetik samikarnon ko badalane par he
 The party not only won two important Darjeeling and Asansol seats but also finished second in three other seats Kolkata South, Kolkata North and Malda South
 kul milakar party ko yahaan par 17 pratishat se zyada vot mila, jo ab tak kaa shreshth pradarshan he
 Earlier in 1991, it received 13 percent votes
 2009 loksabhaa chunaavon main party ko 6
 15 percent of the vote was achieved
 party ne ek samay pashchim bengal kii badi takat vam morche ke vot aadhaar main send lagaakar teesraa sthaan hasil kiya he
 The party's state and central leadership wants to strengthen its position for a close fight with the Trinamool Congress in the 2016 assembly elections
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki agar bhaajapa yahi raftaar barkaraar rakhti he to party rajya main chaar dashak puraane raajnneetik samikarnon main ulatpher kar sakati he
 BJP in-charge BJP spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said, 'the top leadership of the party has told me that this performance should be strengthened keeping in view the 2016 assembly elections in the state
 aglaa vidhansabha chunaav mamata or bhaajapa ke bich hoga
 ' rajya main bhaajapa ke behatar parinaam ko aakaar dene waalon main se ek singh ko lagata he ki vam kii vishwasaneey vipakshi takat kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main mamata virdohi vot bhaajapa ke khate main jayega
 The CPI (M) -led Left Front is also facing a crisis of political presence in Bengal
 pichley loksabhaa main party ko jahaan 43
 66 percent of the vote was received, while in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections it came down to 29 percent
 bhaajapa ne party ke vot aadhaar main sabase zyada send lagaai he
 Since the 2011 assembly elections, the BJP and the RSS have been trying to make inroads in Bengal, particularly in the rural areas of the state, and it has also appeared in several by-elections and municipal elections in the last three years
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan modi ke banerjee par hamale se bhaajapa ko mamata virdohi vot batorne main madad mili
 Political analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said that like other states, Bengal is not in favor of or voting for Modi
 agar modi ko vot nahin dene vaale vot aadhaar main mamata ne badi hissedari hasil kii to bhaajapa ne modi ko samarthan dene vaala vot to hasil kiya hi vam ke kshetra main mamata virdohi vot bhi praapt kiya
 The bjp's hopes are also overshadowed by the fact that the party finished third in 29 seats out of 42 parliamentary constituencies in the state
 kaha jaataa he ki centre kii satta kaa rasta upi se hokar gujarata he
 In 2019, the opposition is trying to close the same path for the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, two major satraps of UP like Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 donon dal modi or amit shah ke vijay rath ko rokane ke liye ek saath aa gaye hai
 The loss of BSP candidate in Rajya Sabha elections has not hurt him either and it is a matter of increasing concern for BJP because if the maya-akhilesh coalition fielded against BJP in 2019, then for BJP in 2019, like 2014 in the state It is not only difficult to repeat the result, it will be impossible
 upi tay karata he dilli kaa rastajab ye kaha jaataa he ki dilli kii satta kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar gujarata he to uske peeche desh kaa raajnneetik itihaas he
 UP has given the highest number of Prime Ministers till now
 pradesh main 80 loksabhaa siten hai
 That is, about one-third of the seats needed to form a government at the Center
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi gathbandhan ne 73 siten jiti thim, tabhi uskaa mishan 272 plus kaamyaab ho paaya tha
 The bsp's account was also not open in those elections
 congress raibareli or amethi tak simit ho gai thi
 Whereas SP could win only five seats of its family
 lekin ye nattejey tab hai jab sapa, basapa or congress bijepi ke khilaaf alag-alag maidan main the
 In the recent Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections, when the SP and BSP came together, the BJP lost its two seats
 duusari baar sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhangorakhpur or phulpur main hue prayog ke nateezon ne sapa-basapa ko ummid se bhar diya he
 Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh first joined hands to stop the BJP wave in 1993 during the Ram Mandir movement
 iskaa asar tha ki bijepi soobe kii satta main nahin aa saki thi
 Now again after 25 years, the SP-BSP alliance is ready
 is baar nishane par rajya kii nahin balki centre kii modi sarkaar he
 The coming of the SP-BSP with 52 per cent SP-BSP will make the bjp's journey very difficult in 2019
 soobe main donon dalon kaa majboot vot bank he
 The state has 12 per cent Yadavs, 22 per cent Dalits and 18 per cent Muslims
 in teenon virgon par sapa-basapa kii majboot pakad he or inhen milakar kareeb 52 fisadi hota he
 That is, half of the voters of the state are directly in the sphere of influence of SP and BSP
 inke alaava baaki obisi samudaay kaa vot bhi in donon dalon ke khate main ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for the BJP to repeat the 2014 election results
 2014 main 42
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections of the BJP, the BJP had 42 per cent of the vote
 30 fisadi vot mili the
 On their own, BJP won 71 seats
 vahiin sapa-basapa ko kul milakar 41
 80 percent votes were received
 congress ko tab 7
 5 percent votes were received
 yani agar sapa, basapa or congress 2019 main saath chunaav lade or 2014 kii modi lahar jaisi voting hi hui to bhi bijepi vipakshi dalon ke mukaable peeche rahegi, 73 siten jeetna to dur kii baat he
 If small parties like RLD are also joined in this grand alliance then UP can prove to be a nightmare for BJP
 vahiin agar keval sapa-basapa hi saath chunaav ladiin to bijepi ko apni pichhali jiti siton main se takreeban aadhi se haath dhonaa padegaa
 Needless to say then what will be the fate of bjp's mission to win 80 seats in UP in 2019

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni paramparaagat sansadeey seat amethi ke saath kerala kii vynad seat se bhi loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Opposition parties are calling Rahul's decision his weakness
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa or kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki congress adhyaksh amethi main asahaj, asurakshit or asahaay mahasoos kar rahe hai
 But has it really been difficult for Rahul Gandhi to carry forward his family's legacy in Amethi firmly, or has he decided to choose another seat with the aim of giving momentum to the party in south politics
 amethi sansadeey seat ko congress kaa abhedya kila mana jaataa he
 There have been 16 general elections and 2 by-elections in this Lok Sabha seat so far
 inamen se congress ne 16 baar jeet darj kii he
 The BJP had won Amethi in 1998, while before that in 1977, the Janata Party had won from here
 in do chunaavon ke alaava amethi se hue kisi bhi chunaav main congress ke alaava koi duusari party jeet nahin saki he
 However, in 2014, when the BJP won a landslide victory in the name of Narendra Modi and won 71 seats in UP 80, the BJP candidate in Amethi seat almost shattered Rahul Gandhi's teeth
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress party ke tikat par rahul gandhi ne chunaav ladaa or unka muqabla bijepi pratyaashee smriti irani se hua
 Rahul Gandhi got a total of 4,08,651 votes in this election, while Smriti Irani was second and got 3,00,748 votes
 yani rahul kii jeet kaa antar mahaj 1 lakh 7 hajaar 903 vot rahaa
 Although the victory of more than one lakh votes is not considered low, but this margin of victory was the lowest in Rahul Gandhi's entire career
 ek or dilachasp aankada ye ki rajya kii kul 80 loksabhaa siton main se 24 seat hi aisi thim, jin par jeet kaa antar ek lakh ke paas yaa usase kam rahaa tha
 That is, in the Modi wave, all the big and small candidates of BJP won the elections with a difference of two lakh to three to four lakh votes
 amethi vaasiyon ko video conferencing ke jariye sambodhit karatin smriti irani2004 main rahul ko mili 66
 2% votes Rahul Gandhi, who contested the Lok Sabha elections for the first time in 2004, contested from Amethi seat 3,90,179 votes (66
 2%) hasil kiye the
 While 99,326 (16
 8%) maton ke saath bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee chandra prakaash mishra duusare number par rahe the
 bjp's Ram Vilas Vedanti was at number three and got a total of 55,438 (9)
 4%) vot mili the
 That is, Rahul Gandhi won his first election by more than 2 lakh 90 thousand votes
 iske baad duusare chunaav main rahul gandhi kaa graph or ooncha chalaa gaya
 Rahul got 71 in 2009
 8% voterahul gandhi ne jab pehla chunaav ladaa to centre main us vakt atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar thi, lekin 2009 main jab congress satta main thi or rahul amethi se apana doosraa chunaav lade to virdohi pratyaashee unke saamne dharaashai ho gaye
 Rahul secured 71 of the total votes, securing 4,64,195 votes
 8% hissaa apane naam kar liya
 While Bahujan Samaj Party's Ashish Shukla finished second with 93,997 votes and BJP candidate Pradeep Kumar Singh got just 37,570 votes
 2014 main rahul ko mili 46
 7% of the vote in 2014 when Smriti Irani led by Narendra Modi entered the battle of Amethi, bjp's vote 5
 8% se chalaang lagaataa hua sidhe 34
 4% reached and Rahul Gandhi's Sensex 71
 8% se girakar 46
 Hinges at 7%
 jabaki hameshaa congress pratyaashee ko takkar dene vaali bispi tisare number par khisak gai or uske pratyaashee ko mahaj 6
 Could get 6 percent votes
 aam aadmi party ke tikat par mashhoor kavi kumaar vishwaas ne bhi chunauti dene kii bharpoor koshish kii, lekin wo mahaj 25 hajaar vot hi hasil kar paae
 Perhaps these figures are giving the basis for BJP to claim that Rahul Gandhi is feeling uneasy in Amethi
 lekin amethi loksabhaa kshetra ke jatigat sameekaran or bahujan samaaj party kaa is seat se chunaav ladanaa rahul gandhi ke paksh main ek bada factor bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Actually, Dalit and Muslim voters are in the role of kingmaker in Amethi Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan muslim matadaata 4 lakh ke kareeb hai or takreeban saadhe teen lakh voter dalit hai
 Among them, the Pasi community voters are quite good
 iske alaava yadav, rajput or brahman bhi is seat par achche khaase hai
 The SP does not field its candidate from Amethi and this time the BSP, which is fighting in the alliance, has also decided not to field any candidate from Amethi
 aise main congress is sameekaran ko dekhakar raahat kii saans le sakati he ki apane paramparaagat maton ke saath is baar rahul gandhi dalit or yadav samaaj kaa acha vot paakar apane vijayi rath ko jari rakhane main kamyaabi hasil kar sakate hai
 But the other aspect of this coin is also that the trend of Dalits has been seen towards BJP, in the same way, if BJP is able to attract voters belonging to BSP and SP, then Amethi can become unsafe for Rahul Gandhi

 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main is baar tonk vidhansabha par sab kii najar tiki hui he
 For the first time in the last 46 years, Congress has not fielded a minority candidate here, for the first time after 38 years, BJP has fielded a minority candidate here
 congress kii taraf se ummidavaar hai rajasthan pradesh congress ke adhyaksh sachin payalat to vahi bijepi ke ummidavaar he vasundhara sarkaar main number do kii haisiyaat rakhane vaale mantri younus khan
 Against 'pilot', Tonk district of BJP veteran 'yunus' Rajasthan used to be the princely state of Nawabs
 aamir khan pindary ne banaas nadi ke thik dakshin main tonk shahar basaaya gaya tha
 Tonk is once again in the discussion with the nomination of Rajasthan Congress state president Sachin Pilot on 19 November
 is seat se congress kii taraf se sachin payalat kaa naam tay hote hi bijepi ne bhi maujuuda vidhayak ajit mehta ko diya hua tikat katkar vasundhara sarkaar ke diggaj mantri younus khan ko maidan main utaar diya
 The political equation of the Tonk Legislative Assembly is significant that from 1972 to 2013, the Congress has fielded only Muslim candidates from Tonk
 jabaki 1980 se lekar 2013 tak bhaajapa ne yahaan keval hindu pratyaashee hi utaare hai
 Tonk's politics has been seen from the perspective of Hindu and Muslim till now, but this time the air of politics is vomiting
 ab tak sangh kii prayogshaala ke taur par rahe tonk se bijepi hameshaa he jain ummidavaar utaarti rahi
 The Jain candidate has been a Hindu face to the Congress's Muslim candidate
 is baar raajnneeti sampradayik nahin balki jatigat ban gai he
 In Tonk, the number of homogeneous Gurjar voters of Sachin Pilot is about 45 thousand, while there are 70 thousand Muslim voters
 is seat par 80 hajaar ke aasapaas essi-asti ke bhi vot hai
 On behalf of Sachin Pilot, mathematics was imposed that if Minorities, SC-ST and Gurjar voters come together, Tonk will become the invincible fortress of Sachin
 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki 15 november ke aadhi raat ko elaan hua ki sachin payalat apane raajnneetik jivan kaa pehla vidhansabha chunaav tonk vidhansabha kshetra se ladenge
 Sachin was already ready, it is being told that Sachin Pilot had been eyeing the Tonk Assembly long back
 jab dilli main chunavi tikat ko lekar party main maaramaari chal rahi thi tab achaanak se khabar ai kii dopaher kii flite se sachin payalat dilli se jaipur aakar tonk gaye or gurjar samaaj kii meeting kii
 After which i went back to Delhi in the evening
 tab logon main charchaa thi ki is tarah se sachin payalat achaanak kyon aae or tonk kyon gaye? us samay kaha gaya gurjar netaaon ne apni jajam par unhen ultimatum dekar bulaayaa tha isliye aana padaa
 But this shows that the pilot had prepared in advance
 sachin payalat ke namakan main jis tarah se bheed umadi he aisi bheed tonk ne pehle kabhi nahin dekhi thi
 a large number of minorities and Gurjar voters were walking in the road show of Sachin Pilot
 sachin payalat kehete hai ki tonk ke liye unhone koi yojana nahin banaai thi yah to bas rahul gandhi kaa aadesh tha
 Pilots go to the villages to eat and talk with the people of the society
 unhen samajhaate hai ki is chunaav main bijepi agar-hindu muslim kare to unke chakkar main mat aa janaa
 Younus Khan bjp's trump card or sacrificial goat? On the other hand, BJP also made a new move and fielded bjp's minority poster boy Yunus Khan here 3 hours before nomination
 bada sawaal he ki kya younus khan bijepi ke liye turup kaa patta he yaa phir party ne unhen bali kaa bakra bana diya he? yah naa to younus khan ko samaj main aa rahaa he or naa hi tonk kii janata ko samaj main aa rahaa he
 Younis Khan had to draw a crowd from his area Didwana to mobilize the Tonk
 apane namakan ke samay younus khan ne logon se kaha ki vah naukar banakar seva karne aae hai, sachin payalat to raja hai, vah kahaan milenge, agar aap hamen chun loge to ham baar-baar milenge 
 The story of giving tickets to Younis Khan is also interesting
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aemoes) younus khan ko kisi bhi keemat par is baar vidhansabha chunaav main nahin utaarna chahta tha, lekin mukhyamantri raaje sangh ke saamne khadi thi ki younus khan ko deedwanaa vidhansabha kshetra se maidan main utaarengi
 Ultimately, Vasundhara Raje won half an incomplete victory
 deedwanaa to nahin mila lekin samajha bujhaakar unuus khan ko tonk bheja gaya
 The Sangh also accepted an incomplete defeat
 deedwanaa to nahin diya lekin sangh ke garh tonk main muslim pratyaashee younus khan ko utaarne par sahamat ho gaye
 Rajasthan: Why was Pilot and Gehlot forced to contest elections? BJP has done the trick that the minority will win by making a dent of 70 thousand minority votes in the name of the candidate, but the minority villagers of Tonk have been different Has been tonk-malpura kaa ilaaka sabase zyada sampradayik dangon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Tonk's identity has been here, the camel has been sacrificed here instead of the goat on the day of Bakrid
 bijepi kii ranneeti kaa to pataa nahi lekin kaha ja rahaa he ki is baar sachin payalat kii vajah se hindu-musalmaan saath dikh rahe hai jo tonk ke liye acha he
 What are the issues of Tonk? Tonk district of Rajasthan is a backward rural area, where there is no such thing as facilities
 bahut lambey samay se log maang karte rahe hai ki yahaan kam se kam railway stesan or rail line to honi hi chahie
 This area is the area of farmers where 80 percent of the population is dependent on farming
 gaanv ke logon kaa kahana he ki is baar sachin payalat se unhen kaaphi ummiden hai
 Sachin Pilot is young
 dilli tak unki pahunch he
 He has developed a lot in Ajmer and Dausa
 log ummid kar rahe hai ki usee tarah tonk kaa vikaas ho jayega
 In Tonk itself, Rajasthan's largest reservoir is the Bisalpur Dam, from where the thirst of Jaipur quenches, but Tonk does not get water to the people
 pichhali vasundhara sarkaar main sohela main pani maang rahe kisaanon par firing hui thi or tab 5 kisaan maare gaye the
 The other big problem of farmers here is not getting the right price for crops
 centre sarkaar ghoshnaa to karti he ki unki fasal samarthan mulya par kharidi jaaegi lekin ise bichauliye le udate hai
 Millet is the highest in the area
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rajasthan kii reliyon main logon se kaha tha ki unhone bajre kaa samarthan mulya dhai guna tak badha diya he
 But the cultivation of Bajra ended, the crop is being sold in the market but not a single grain of millet was purchased at the support price
 jis vajah se kisaan thaga hua mahasoos kar rahe hai

 lekin hamane sifologist kii ek team lagaai he jo aapako apana behtareen anumaan de sakate hai
 He said, 'the results of this election will give me answers to many questions
 isamen kuch buniyadi sawaal hai
 For example, does a government with an absolute majority develop the country better than coalition governments? Does the country want an effective leader or just a good team? What is the difference between Hinduism and being a Hindu? Where does patriotism end and nationalism begin? Do voters vote differently for state legislatures and differently for general elections? There have been 31 elections to the assemblies in the last five years
 chunaavon ke liye sach kitne myne rakhte hai? kya prem, jang or chunaavon main sab kuch jaij he? 2019 main soshal media kii bhoomika kya hogi? or kya pulavama hamale kaa chunaav par koi asar hoga? in sawaalon ke jawaab hi desh ke bhavishya kaa nirdhaaran karenge
 'it is very difficult to predict the election results,' he said, adding that in democracy no one has got the divine gift to rule forever

 Many teams which seemed to be getting clean, dusted the dust and stood again like a Phoenix bird

 Since when did treason become a dissent? Does such a word even exist in 2019 India? Since when did critics become anti-national? Is there a north-south division? Is the jobless growth happening in the country? Over the next two days, many experts and those at the top of power will answer these questions

 bharat ke gendbaaji coach bharat arun ne tej gendbaaj jasprit bumraah kii vah khubi bataai, jisaki vajah unhone australia main dhooma machaa di he
 On Saturday, coach Bharat said that Bumrah's unconventional bowling action has made him one of the most dangerous fast bowlers in world cricket, as it becomes difficult for the batsman of the opposition team to understand his balls
 bumraah ne melbern main australia ke khilaaf tisare test main ab tak aath wicket jatke hai or janvari main khel ke is praaroop main padaarpan ke baad unhone 47 test wicket apane naam kar liye hai
 Arun said, 'bumrah has become very special because of his different bowling action
 shaayad ballebaaj unki gendon ko thodi der se pakad pate hai, jisase vah kaaphi kargar ban jate hai
 Of course, any fast bowler has to bowl very fast with his hands to bowl at a speed of 145 kmph or more

 Arun said that the coaching staff has to do a lot of work to keep the 25-year-old Bumrah strong, as his bowling action puts a lot of burden on his body
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe bumraah ke saath tab kaam karne kaa mauka mila, jab vah under-19 str par khelte the, tab main ensie main tha
 i felt that Bumrah can bowl much faster than his action, but this affects his body

 The first phase of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's Kisan Yatra, which started on 6 September in UP, is over
 in 2 dinon kii chuttee ke dauraan rahul ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor pehle apni team ke saath milakar bhavishya kii ranneeti taiyaar karne main jute hai
 PK is taking feedback from his team during road trips, road shows, Khat Chaupal, Nukkad Sabha and meetings with Dalits
 saath hi yatra ke dauraan sthaneey netaaon kii bhoomika kii bhi report maangi ja rahi he
 It is said that in the Prashant Kishore report, in particular, they are looking at which leader, how hard, and where the journey has been lost during the visit of Kirahul
 sthaneey netaaon kii kasi jaaegi lagaampani team se report lene ke baad pike is mudde par jaldi hi pradesh prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad or pradesh ke duusare bade netaaon se charchaa karenge
 After this, PK himself will discuss with Rahul Gandhi that in the next phase of the journey, he will take care that there is no shortfall in the journey ahead
 saath hi un sthaneey netaaon par bhi lagaam kasi jaaegi, jinke ilaakon main yatra ummid ke mutabik nahin rahi yaa jahaan kuch kami rah gayi he
 This will send a message to the local leaders in the next phase of the yatra that if there is a shortage then it is not good
 sthaneey netaaon ko khaas nirdeshprashanth kishor ne congress alaakaman ko yatra main ai bheed ko vot main badalane ke liye khaas suzav die hai, jin par rahul ke nirdesh ke baad upi congress ko amal karne ko kaha gaya he
 In fact, PK suggests that it will be the responsibility of local leaders and activists to maintain an atmosphere among the public once Rahul's visit is over
 kisaan kii karj maafee, bijli bill half karnaa or samarthan mulya ke naare ko ghar-ghar main jivit rakhaa jaae, varna halaat 2007 or 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon jaise ho jaaenge
 Because there was a crowd in Rahul's meetings, but did not get votes
 rahul kii 'pike ranneeti' par muharkhud team pike or congress party andarkhaane yah monitering kar rahe hai ki rahul kii yatra guzarane ke baad koun apane ilaake main sakriy he or koun nahin
 This report will be kept as a scale in ticket distribution
 philhal rahul gandhi nepike ke saare sujhavamaanakar upi congress ko ection main aane ko kah diya he
 Team pk's slogans get Rahul's consent
 In the first phase of his journey, Rahul has targeted PM Modi the most, but according to initial feedback, the election is of UP, so in order to favor the atmosphere against the ruling party Sharp attacks are considered necessary
 isiilie team pike ne naare taiyaar kar rahul se sahmati lekar congressiyon se in naaron ko failaane ko kaha he
 These are the slogans coined by Team PK - 1) a unique initiative has started, the village-village Khat Sabha has started, there is hope in Delhi farmers from Deoria
 2) rahul ji ke is abhiyaan mensabhi kisaan bhai chal rahe hai shaan main
 3) Whatever will never happen now, debt of farmers will be forgiven, there will be development in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul ji will be with you
 4) akhilesh ji aap thak chuke, ab aap se kuch nahin hoga, 2017 aapke liye by-by hogub aap karo aaraam, kisaanon kaa naa jeena karo haraam
 The farmers have now woken up and recognized the reality of Netaji

 Actually, only Deepika, Shahid and Ranviratino are busy with their other projects
 haalanki bollywood kii galiyaaron se khabaren to ye bhi aa rahi hai ki deepika or ranvir film kii shooting jald hi shuru karne vaale hai lekin abhi tak shahid kapur kaa shooting shedul fiks nahin ho paaya he kyonki indinon vah apane nanhee beti ke saath zyada se zyada vakt guzaar rahe hai

 himachal pradesh ke nae mukhyamantri ke naam kaa elaan kal vidhayak dal kii baithak main kiya jayega
 On Thursday, supervisors Nirmala Sitharaman and Narendra Tomar held a meeting with party mlas in Shimla
 sutron ke mutabik vidhayakon se baat karke party haikaman ko brif kiya jayega
 Supervisors will consult all the mlas and take their opinion
 iske baad kal vidhayak dal kii baithak main mukhyamantri ke naam kaa elaan kiya jayega
 Earlier, supporters of Jairam Thakur were shouting slogans outside the meeting in Shimla
 vahiin dhumal ke bhi samarthak jute hue the
 There is still doubt about the name of the new Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh
 party kii jeet ke chaar din baad bhi abhi tak mukhyamantri ke naam par sahmati nahi ban pai he
 According to sources, JP Nadda and Prem Kumar Dhumal are both out of the race and the party has decided to make any MLA a CM instead of a loser
 himachal party prabharee mangal pandey bhi shimla main hui baithak main maujuud the
 Dhumal agreed on Jairam! Jai Ram Thakur met former Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal at his Samirpur residence on Wednesday and consulted him for about half an hour
 dhumal unako chhodane gaadi tak aae or jai ram thakur ne baqayada unase pair chhukar aashirwad liya
 It is believed that Dhumal camp has given its consent in the name of Jai Ram Thakur
 udhar dhumal khemaa abhi tak mukhyamantri pad ke liye apni jor-aajamaaish kar rahaa he
 Although most of Dhumal's close contests have been lost, many mlas who have won have been with him
 kutlehad ke vidhayak virendra kanvar or paunta ke vidhayak sukhram ne unke liye apni seat khaali karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 But the two camps of Prem Kumar Dhumal, one led by Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda and the other led by former Chief Minister Shanta Kumar, have also stood against the Dhumal camp
 mukhyamantri pad kii daud main ek kunvaara bhibaat agar uttar pradesh or haryana kii karen to bhartiya janata party ne do kunvaaron ko mukhyamantri banaaya he
 There is a bachelor leader of BJP in Himachal Pradesh also, named Ajay Jamwal
 jogindernagara ke nivasee ajay jamwalrashtriya swayamsevak sanghapramukh mohan bhagwat ke kareebi hai or aresas ke kai ohadon par kaam kar chuke hai
 He is currently serving as the north-east Regional Organization Minister
 isse pehle vah jammu-kashmir, punjab main bhi sanghathan mantri ke rup main kaary kar chuke hai
 Only a Rajput will be made CM! From the point of view of caste equation, till now most of the Chief Ministers of Himachal Pradesh belong to Rajput community
 haalanki himachal pradesh ke aadhe matadaata jin virgon dalit (26%), janajati (6%) or pichde varg (15%) ke hai, unase ajtak koi bhi mukhyamantri nahin ban paaya
 While Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda is also in the race for the post of Chief Minister and he has also met the national president Amit Shah, but his being a Brahmin can create an imbalance in the caste equation
 himachal pradesh main brahmanon samudaay ke matadaata 20 fisadi or rajput samudaay ke matadaata 35 fisadi hai
 Both Jai Ram Thakur and Ajay Jamwal belong to the Rajput community
 purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal bhi rajput hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clarified that whether it is Gujarat or Himachal Pradesh, the Chief Minister will be commanded by a youth
 yani saaf he ki bhaajapa alaakaman ek yuva chehre ko mukhyamantri kaa pad saunpna chahta he

 hindu-musalmaan nahin chahta ki koi vivaad ho
 The Deputy Chief Minister further said that wherever the role of the government is, it will fully cooperate
 main to chahta hum ki kal hi se mandir nirmaan shuru ho jaae
 Zafaryab Jilani said - It is unfortunate that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board lawyer Zafaryab Jilani reacted to this decision of the Supreme Court saying that it is unfortunate that the Supreme Court did not accept our reconsideration petitions
 philhal ham yah nahin kah sakate ki hamaara aglaa kadam kya hoga
 We will consult our senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan on this
 viechpi boli- swaagat yogya kadamavishv hindu parishad ne supreme court ke is faisle par apni khushi jaahir karte hue twit kiya he

 ab sabhi pakshon ko nirnay swikaarna chahie
 The Government of India should be constituted without delay and pave the way for a grand temple on the birthplace of Lord Shri Ram "

 na jane asaram ko wo koun si beemaari he, jiskaa ilaaj sirf or sirf unki mahila vaidya nita hi kar sakati hai
 Medical science has been deceived, the doctors are shocked but Asaram says that the cure for his illness is only in Nita's hands and then by pleading with the court, Asaram is asking for pure indigenous treatment for his illness
 asaram ne 4 sitambar ko jodhpur ke jila or seshan court main jaj ke naam ek khat bheja tha
 Written in that letter in the service, Honorable District and Sessions Judge District - Jodhpur (raj
 )mananeey,vishyantargat lekh he ki main gat kareeb saadhe teraa varsh se trinadi shul naamak vyaadhi se grasit hum tathaa meraa ilaaj pichley 2-3 varsh se vaidya nitaji dwaara kiya ja rahaa he
 Which mainly treats a part of Panchakarma by Shirodhara, which takes about two hours
 at: aapashri se anurodh he ki vaidya nitaji ko meri uparokt beemaari ke ilaaj hetu aagaamee aath dinon tak pratidin unke samyaanukool kendriya karagaar main bulaane kii prarthana par kaarywahi karen
 Santshree Asaram Bapu The court heard the letter of Asaram, who calls himself a saint from his tongue, on Wednesday as well as on Thursday
 guuruuvaar ko aadhe ghante tak adaalat main is baat par jirah hoti rahi ki asaram ke paas nita ko bheja jaae yaa nahin
 Manish Vyas, advocate for the victim girl, argued that there is no disease like Trinadi shul
 is par asaram ke vakil ne daleel di ki asaram 13 saal se is beemaari se grast hai
 Vaidya Neeta has been treating him
 lihaaja unhen ilaaj kii ijaajat di jaae
 On this, the victim's lawyer said that it is clear from the medical check-up that Asaram is completely healthy
 phir bhi unhen mahila vaidya kii jarurat he to iske bare main asaram se ek baar phir puch lenaa chahie
 In response, Asaram's lawyer said that it is fine
 ham asaram se baat karenge ki unhen nita ke ilaaj kii jarurat he yaa nahin
 On this, the judge gave the next date of hearing on Tuesday
 adaalat kii choukhat par jamaanat kii chahat to philhal adhuri or achet padi he lekin mahila vaidya kii chahat bhi philhal adalati chakkar main atka hua he
 Trinidary colic aka Anant Vata aka Trigeminal Neuralgia
 ek rog ke teen naam
 Trigeminal neuralgia in allopaths, Anant Vata in Ayurveda and Asaram's verbal truncated colic
 ek naaballig ladki ke yon shoshan ke aarope main jail main band asaram isi beemaari kaa hawala dekar mahila vaidya nita ko maang rahe hai har roj do ghante ke liye
 According to Neeta, Nism, Shirodhara and Karnapuran are treated in this Trinadi shul disease
 dard zyada badhane par aath dinon tak lagaataar shirodhara kerani padati he, jisamen kareeb dedh ghante kaa samay lagata he
 Those who know Ayurveda believe such a disease, but for the treatment of it, only a female doctor is needed, it does not hurt them
 lekin kuch saal pehle tak asaram kaa vaidya rah chuke amrit prajapati kaa maananaa he ki ye sab asaram kaa bahaanaa he
 The real purpose is to get opium
 wo bhi sanbhak yoga ke liye yani sex power badhaane ke liye
 But experts in English medicine say that if Asaram has a disease like trigeminal neuralgia, he can be treated properly
 asaram kii beemaari to jaanch kaa vishay he or bahuton ke liye shodh kaa
 However, when he got a medical check-up after going to jail, 72-year-old Asaram looked absolutely fit
 is bich bahes main ab phir se sabaki nazren jodhpur ke jila or seshan court par tiki he, jahaan mangalvaar ko agali sunwaayee honi he ki asaram ko trinadi shul kii beemaari he yaa nahin or kya iskaa shuddh desi ilaaj hi hoga- vaidya nita ke jariye
 Asaram had pleaded with the court for his illness
 wo beemaari, jiskaa ilaaj ek mahila vaidya nita hi kar sakati hai lekin kabhi asaram kaa ilaaj karne vaale ek puraane vaidya amrit prajapati ne unki duusari pole-pattee khol di
 According to Prajapati, Asaram uses opium and has given a new code word for it Panched Booty
 ratlam se kareeb 17 kilometre dur asaram kaa panched ashram he
 According to Prajapati, Asaram himself gets poppy cultivated there and always asks for opium from there
 usee ashram ke naam par iskaa naam panched booti rakh diya
 According to Prajapati, Asaram used to ask for sex-enhancing drugs like Kamini Mardan, Ashwagandha, Shilajit, Makardhwaja Ras many times
 aise main asaram kii beemaari kai sawaalon main ghir jaati he
 On the one hand, Baba is suffering inside the jail, on the other side his lady doctor is getting restless outside the jail
 apni beemaari ko lekar baba jitne pareshaan hai, unka ilaaj naa kar paane ko lekar unki mahila vaidya kahin unase bhi zyada pareshaan
 That is, the condition of Baba inside the jail is the same as that of his physician outside the jail
 ab ise baba kaa pratap nahin kahenge to or kya kahenge, jisane mariz se zyada doctor kaa haal bura kar rakhaa he
 Vaidya Neeta, who received the degree of Ayurvedacharya from Tilak Ayurveda College, Pune, was not like this earlier, but what did she take initiation from Asaram in 1998, she remained devoted to Baba and now this dedication of these days in this city of Rajasthan Is clearly visible in vinod khanna ko peshawar ke garv ke rup main yaad karte hue guuruuvaar ko yahaan unke janmasthan par logon ne hindi filmon ke mahaan abhinayta ko shradhanjali arpit kii or kaha ki unke sammaan main cultural heritage council ek samaaroh kaa aayojan karegi

 There was a time when Goa was away from the crimes
 magar ab us goa ko bhi gunahagaaron kii najar lag gai he
 Two girls from Delhi had gone to Goa
 ye sochakar ki kuch din dilli se dur goa main bekhauf or mahfuj rahengi
 But look at the situation that the two women of Delhi are not only kidnapped but also gangraped with them later on the beach in Goa, which is safe for women
 or to or donon kii video film bhi utaar lee jaati he
 The beautiful sea shore in the mind after mentioning the small Subegova of India situated on the banks of Arabian Sea
 shant or sukun kaa maahaul jaisi tasviir ghoomane lagati he
 Perhaps this is the reason why not only India but millions of people from all over the world are drawn towards Goa every year
 lekin somvaar kii raat isi goa main jo kuch hua, usne yahaan rahane vaale logon ko hi nahin balki puri duniya ko sann kar diya
 On Monday 2 June, around 9 pm, like any other day, this evening was very pleasant here
 duniya bhar se aae sailaani raat dhalane ke saath hi ek shandaar nite out kii taiyaari main lage the
 These two tourists also included two girls, who were going for dinner in Bagha area by hiring a taxi
 lekin achaanak in ladakiyon or unke driver ko aihsaas hua ki kuch log unka peechha kar rahe hai
 To check his suspicions, the driver slowed down his car at a traffic light, but what was feared happened
 peeche ek bike par chal rahe do logon ne bhi apni bike roak lee
 Then suddenly the bikers called someone and four-five people on two bikes surrounded their taxi
 isse pehle ki teenon kuch samaj pate bike par aae badmaashon ne unke saath marpet shuru kar di
 They beat the taxi driver as well as the girls badly
 khud ko anti narcotics cell ke pulicekarmi bataate hue unhone ladakiyon ko apane saath chalane ke liye kaha
 Till now both the girls and the taxi-goers did not even believe that they are not policemen
 driver ko to ye lag rahaa tha ki shaayad wo log taxi ko chaanbin ke liye kisi thane main le janaa chaahate hai
 But on the contrary, the rogue on the bike took the taxi directly to a house in Arapora area and arrested the three in the name of investigation
 badmaashon ke saath thi ek auratis ghar main badmaashon ke saath ek aurat bhi maujuud thi, jinhone talaashi ke naam par ladakiyon ke kapade tak utarava daale
 Here the miscreants beat the three badly and started recording videos of all three on mobile
 badmaashon ne ladakiyon se khud ko jismfaroshi kaa dhandha karne vaali ladkiyaan bataane or taxi driver ko unka dalal kehane ke liye majaboor kiya
 All these things were recorded by miscreants on mobile
 raat nau baje shuru hua julmo-sitam kaa ye silsilaa lagaataar jari tha
 During this time, the miscreants robbed the money they had with the three, by taking them to an ATM and also withdrawing money from their account
 lekin kareeb dedh baje jane unhen kya soojha ki unhone taxi driver ko aaazaad karne kaa faisla kiya
 However, he threatened the driver to keep his mouth shut and said that he returned as soon as possible with one and a half lakh rupees to rescue the girls
 aage padhie, kaise kaam ai driver kii tarkeeb
 
 
 The driver was constantly trying to leave after the driver's tricks got caught in the clutches
 lekin der raat kareeb dedh baje uski ek tarkeeb achaanak kaam kar gai
 He told the miscreants that if he did not reach home now, then the people of his house should not go to the police in search of him
 bas, police kaa naam sunate hi badmaashon ko bhanda footne kaa dar sataane laga or unhone usee vakt driver ko aaazaad kar diya
 He went straight home
 lekin ghar ke baahar hi subah hone kaa intjaar karata rahaa or tab apane gharavaalon ke saath vah police ke paas pahunchaa
 After releasing the driver to the new hideout, the gangsters took the girls to another hideout and gang-raped them there
 duusari ore, driver ne ladakiyon ko agava karne kaa puraa vakya to police ko bataaya hi saath hi ye bhi bataaya ki badmaash ladakiyon ko chhodane ke liye or dedh lakh rupayon kii maang kar rahe hai
 Just, the police took advantage of this greed of the miscreants and spread a whole trap of arresting them by phone
 ab thane main baitha ye driver phone par badmaashon se baat karata rahaa or police unke telephone intercept karne kii koshish karne lagi
 Eventually the deal to pay one and a half lakh rupees was done and the miscreants called the driver with money in Kalangut area
 
 
 
 And Dhar was already stationed in plain clothes at the site of the captured Badmashpullis deal
 kalangute jankshan par lambey intjaar ke baad dopaher kareeb teen baje is driver ko ek badmaash najar aayaa
 The policemen caught hold of the driver as soon as he got the signal
 iske baad uski nishandehi par police ne naa sirf agava kii gai ladakiyon ko chhudaaya, balki chaar or badmaashon ko giraftaar kar liya
 They were identified as Trevor Joseph, Jeevan Pawar, Kamlesh Chaudhary, Ajay Kumar Kushwaha and Nadeem Syed in the interrogation
 police kii maane to inamen se ek nite club main kaam karanevaala bounsar he, jisane apane doston ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke saath jyaadati karne or lutpaat karne kii ye puri sajeesh rachi thi
 Currently, the Goa police has taken the five accused on remand for five days for questioning, while the search for the remaining accused including a woman is on

 sarkari yojana ko amal main laane ke liye kolhapur jail main chori se lekar khun ke aaropon main kaid log bhagwaan kaa prasad bana rahe hai
 Every day 15 male and 15 female prisoners from the age of 25 years to 50 years will make 3 thousand pearls of laddus
 jail in ladduon ko banane ke baad jail prashasan ko supurd karegaa or phir har laddu 10 rupye main bhakton ko prasad ke rup main bechaa jayega
 On the occasion of Navratri and other festivities, Kolhapur Jail Administration is claiming to show the maximum demand for laddus with the help of additional prisoners
 tippaniyan Neither the temple trust nor the government is making any profit from this scheme
 baavjood is muhim par aapatti uthaa rahi he
 Sanatan Sanstha spokesperson Abhay Vartak believes that this can have a greater impact of tamoguna on devotees
 NDTV india se baatcheet main vartak ne kaha ki kaidi se hue aparaadh ke chalate usamen maujuud tamogun kii adhikta swayanspasht he
 Therefore Sanatan opposes this project
 ve aage poochhate hai ki is muhim kii pairvi karanevaale kya apane ghar main kaidiyon ke haath kaa bana tifin khaaenge? On the other hand, despite all the protests, the jail administration is firm on its decision
 saath hi bhagwaan kaa prasad banane kii jagah par safasafai rakhane kaa daawa bhi kar rahaa he
 Some local people and media representatives were also shown the place of making it before offering it to the goddess to confirm her claim
 is yojana se na mandir trust isse munaafaa nahin kama rahaa he na sarkaar
 Despite this, the campaigner is raising objections
 sanathan sanstha ke pravaktaa abhaya vartak kaa maananaa he ki is se bhakton par tamogun kaa prabhaav adhik ho saktaa he
 Talking to NDTV India, Vartak said that due to the crime of the prisoner, the excess of tamoguna present in it is self-evident
 isliye sanathan is project kaa virodh karata he
 They further ask, will those who defend this mission eat tiffin made by the prisoners in their homes? udhar, tamaam virodhon ke baavjood jail prashasan apane faisle par kaayam he
 At the same time, it is also claiming to have cleanliness in place of making prasad of God
 apane daawey kii pushti ke liye devi ko bhoga chadhaane se pehle use banane kii jagah kuch sthaneey log or media ke numaayindon ko bhi dikhaai gai
 On the other hand, despite all the protests, the jail administration is firm on its decision
 saath hi bhagwaan kaa prasad banane kii jagah par safasafai rakhane kaa daawa bhi kar rahaa he
 Some local people and media representatives were also shown the place of making it before offering it to the goddess to confirm her claim
 pulavama hamale ke baad ghati se do tasviren saamne ain
 Both these pictures are the beginning of a new convoy
 sabase pehle pehali tasviir kii baat
 Whenever a convoy of our soldiers is on the road in Kashmir Valley, no other vehicle will be allowed to be shattered around it
 yahaan tak ki agar kisi ne kafile ko overtek karne yaa kafile ke bich main aane kii koshish kii to ise vidroh mana jayega
 Once the army convoy reached the highway, then the normal traffic would stop until the convoy passed
 ab sena kii har gaadi kii chat par hathiyaar se las jawan hoga
 Showing a red flag will indicate to clear the way
 kaafile ke saath-saath mins protected gaadi bhi hogi
 While passing the convoy, movement of common vehicles will be stopped
 pulavama hamale ke baad sena ke kaafile ke saath ajtak kii team ne kiya safar
 It was the jammu-srinagar National Highway
 jo 295 kilometre lanbaa he
 The only route from Jammu to Kashmir Valley and from Valley to Jammu
 is neshnal haive ke mil stone number 272 ke kareeb hi 14 farvari ko siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa hua tha
 Hundreds of trains of army and security forces pass through different parts of the valley almost daily, including this national highway
 or in guzarati gadiyon ke saath hi chalati hai aam logon kii bhi gaadiyaan
 And one such vehicle suddenly came on 4 Farawki near Pulwama and collided with CRPF convoy
 magar pulavama hamale ke baad ghati main sena ke kafile kii hifaazat ko lekar ab kai tabdiliyaan kii gai hai
 The team of crime became witness to these changes
 hamaare sahyogi gaurav saavant uttari kashmir main sena ke aise hi ek kafile ke safar ke humsafar bane
 Now, during the passing of an army convoy, the movement of common trains on the way or at any point will be stopped until the convoy passes
 isamen logon ko das se bees minute tak intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 That is, as soon as the army convoy reaches the highway, all the trains will be stopped and people will be stopped from walking
 rasta saaf hone ke baad sena ke is kafile ke sabase aage mins protected gaadi chal rahi thi
 So that he can deal with any kind of danger
 har gaadi kii chat par ek jawan hathiyaar liye puure raste par paini nigaah rakhe tha
 So that any common car or person tries to come in the middle of the convoy or in front of the convoy, then it can be stopped
 jawan siti baja kar or laal jhanda dikhaa kar bhi aam gadiyon ko raste se hatane kaa ishaara de rahe hai
 According to the new changes that have taken place regarding the movement of the army convoy, the dynamic convoy movement will now rule for every convoy of the army
 koi civil gaadi us dauraan root par nahin guzaregi
 Police will have the responsibility to stop the civil trains
 laal jhanda dikhaane kaa matlab hoga jo gaadi jahaan he vahiin ruk jaae
 Trains crossing the red flag will be considered rebel
 convoy guzarane ke dauraan 15 se 20 minute tak trephic thama rahegaa
 The Army Highway Dominions team will protect every Convoy from front, center and back
 convoy ke raste main aana yaa overtek karne kii koshish karne vaale ko bhi vidrohi mana jayega
 Actually, till now the army convoy used to pass along with the common vehicles
 haalanki ise lekar pehle bhi kai baar baat hui ki suraksha kaarnon se sena ke kafile ke bich main aam logon kii gadiyon nahin aani chahien
 But the problem was most on the jammu-srinagar National Highway
 yahaan trephic zyada he or kafile ke liye aam yatayaat rokna mushkil
 Therefore, an idea also came that the movement of the army convoy should be restricted for the night
 kyonki raat ko amuman haive par trephic bahut kam hota he
 But there were some problems with the night journey, so it could not be implemented

 On June 29, Rajkumar Hirani's film Sanju is set for release
 film ke tiger or trailor ke jari hone ke baad se hi ye film charchaaon main hai
 The audience is eager to see the ups and downs of Sanjay Dutt's life
 sanjay dutt kii byopic banane kaa faisla lene vaale diarector rajkumaar hiraani ne khaas baatcheet main actor jindagi se judi kai baton ko share kiya
 Why did people think of making a biopic on Sanjay Dutt's life? People know the story of Sanjay Dutt, but a different world appeared when i sat with him
 sanjay dutt kaa unke pita ke saath rishta or doston ke saath relationships kii kahani kaaphi dilachasp thi
 So i decided to write a story on it
 pita ko yaad kar bhavuk hue sanjay dutt, kaha- hameshaa achche nahin rahe rishtepahali baar sanjay dutt se aapaki mulaakaat kab hui?hamane unhen munnabhai ke jimmy shergill vaale kirdaar ke liye approach kiya tha
 Because we had already finalized the name of Shahrukh Khan for the lead role of Munnabhai
 lekin jab munna ke role ke liye shahrukh ko approach kiya to unke paas dats nahin thim, phir hamane sanju ko kaha kii unhen munnabhai kaa mukhya role karnaa he
 Hearing this, he was shocked and upset because he did not even have dates
 lekin film kii script padhane ke baad sanjay dutt ne is film ke liye haa kar di
 How did you decide to choose Paresh Rawal for the role of Sunil Dutt? Ranbir's casting for Sanju was immediately done
 lekin dutt sahab ke kirdaar ke liye hamen kaaphi samay laga
 We were not getting anyone who looked a little like them
 kyonki unki koi style nahin thi, wo hameshaa clin shev or bade hue baalo main najar aate the
 We tried his looks with many people, but it didn't work, so it seemed that we cast Sanjay Dutt as Sunil Dutt
 lekin wo bevakoofi hoti kyonki sanjay ke saamne sanjay khadey hote
 Then we told Paresh Rawal Saheb, he did the reading with us and finally we got Sunil Dutt Saheb
 sunil dutt ke saath kabhi aapaki khaas mulaakaat hui?dutt sahab se main munnabhai ke dauraan mila tha
 When the script was sent to him, he asked for the script in Urdu, we sent the same script
 9 baje ke shift main wo saadhe aath baje aa jate the, unhen venity vine, monitor jaisi baaten nai lagati thim
 He was a very disciplined person, after 6 months of dubbing, he himself brought the same script that we gave him, while we give new script in dubbing
 aamir khan se bhi sunil dutt ke kirdaar ke bare main aapane baatcheet kii thi?aamir mere dost hai, main sabhi script unhen sunaata hum, jab maine unhen sanju kii script sunai to unhone kaha kii yaar main nahin hum teri film main
 And the same thing happened when i was doing 3 Idiots, then Sanjay Dutt said that in the film Yaar Main Hoon Hoon Teri
 to aamir kii baat par lautate hai, maine unhen majaak main kah diya ki aamir aap pitaaji kaa role kar lijiye
 He called me in Panchgani and said, 'I am playing the role of an old man in Dangal, after that if i do the same role then i will not get young roles
 ' phir unhone majaak main kaha ki agar tum mujhe sanju kaa role dete to main wo jarur karata
 Didn't you think that many people might object to this biopic? The first thing is that no one has approached me angry for biopic
 duusari baat film banaate hue hamen eemaandaar hona bhi jaruri hota he
 To make a story in two and a half hours, you have to live many characters
 vaise bhi hamane drugs, gan rishton par hi focus kiya he
 One of the specialties of your films is that they portray father-son and friendship very well
 Yes, relationships with my father and with friends have been important in my life too
 shaayad vahi baat parade par aa jaati he
 When Partition happened, Papa came to India from Sindh (pakistan), he often told stories there
 ek din main jarur us ilaake main janaa chaahunga, vahaan ke nawab shah naamak shahar se wo taalluk rakhte the, ghodon par jaaya karte the
 My father told that he had seen a bicycle for the first time in India
 lekin in kisson ko film main pirone ke bare main abhi nahin sochaa he
 Salman commented on 'sanju', Ranbir Kapoor gave this answer when will Munnabhai go to America? Munnabhai will not go to America, but Munnabhai will definitely become the next part
 ham log bas is film kii scrupting main jute hue hai
 After the release of Sanju, it will be noticed
 nai kahani likhi ja rahi he, america vaali kahani nahin banegi
 Is your pair of aristocrats exactly like the salim-javed pair? No, it is wrong to say, our talent is not like that
 ham donon bas lage rahete hai, chhodte nahin hai
 We cannot do the work like salim-javed
 kya aap ek or byopic bana rahe hai?nahin, aisa bilkul nahin he, ye sab afvaah he

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne china ke sandarbh main bhartiya grih mantralay par aalochanatmak tippaniyan karne ke liye paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh kii somvaar ko khinchaai kii or naseehat di ki vah duusare mantralayon kii karypranali par tippanee na karen
 Manmohan spoke to Ramesh and made it clear to him that the government had 'no illusions' about its stand towards China with which she wanted a 'constructive relationship'
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ke sutron ne bataaya ki manmohan ne ramesh se kaha ‘mantrimandal sahyogiyon ke liye yah salaah he ki ve duusare mantralayon kii karypranali par tippanee na karen khaskar china jaise mahatvapurn padosiyon ke sandarbh main
 The strong message from the Prime Minister came two days after Ramesh's remarks in Beijing
 ramesh ne china kii rajdhani main kaha tha ki chini companiyon ke bharat main pravesh ko lekar grih mantralay ‘aavashyaktaa se adhik rakshaatmak’ or ‘chaukas’ rukh apanaae hue he
 Manmohan told Ramesh "there is no confusion in our policies about China and we want a constructive relationship with Beijing
" ’ramesh ne kopgahen shikhar sammelan main jalwaayu parivartan par bharat or china ke bich viksit utsaah ke bare main baat karte hue salaah di thi ki grih mantralay (bhartiya) ko bharat main chini nivesh ke prati ‘adhik udaar’ najariya apnaanaa chahie
 The Home Ministry also rebuked Ramesh for his remarks and said that no discrimination is being done against Chinese companies
 grih sachiv jike pillai ne kaha ‘yah kahana galat he ki suraksha pratishthan chiniyon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav vaala rukh rakhte hai
 "he said" Chinese companies are already present in India in large numbers
 ve doorsanchaar sahit vibhinn kshetron main kaam kar rahi hai
 i do not believe that there is any discrimination from the government
 ’ramesh ne shanivaar ko kaha tha ki suraksha pratishthan bharat main chini nivesh par ‘bina aavashyaktaa’ pratibandh thope rahe hai
 He made the remarks in the context of recent news that India has banned import of telecom equipment from Chinese major Huawei, especially in the border areas, due to security concerns
 congress bhi ramesh kii tippaniyon par naaraaz he
 a senior party leader said, 'making comments against the policy and functioning of a sensitive ministry like Home Ministry and that too on the ground of another country cannot be justified
 yadi mudde par matbhed hai to inhen party or sarkaar ke str par sulaajhaana chahie
 When asked about this, Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said, "let the minister come back and explain what he has said
" vah hi bataa sakate hai ki unhone jo kuch kaha kya uske bare main koi bhram he’
 Dal has become a major issue in Bihar assembly elections
 ek ore jahaan kendriya mantri daal kii badi keemat ke liye rajya sarkaar ko doshi bataa rahe hai, vahiin duusari ore rajya sarkaar iske liye centre kii nitiyon ko doshi bataa rahi he
 The two sides are putting this ball of inflation in each other's court
 bihar kii janata is raajnneeti ke bich daal kii badi keemat se pareshaan he
 Although the central and state governments are blaming each other in this election, the increased price of pulses has brought the NDA leaders on the back foot
 daal kii badi keemat ko mudda banaae jane par kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh or khaadya upabhokta mantri ramvilas paswan saamne aae
 Nitish put the blame on the government for the increased price of pulses
 radhamohan singh ne kaha ki centre ne kam se kam chah baar sarkaar ko daal kharid ko lekar patr bheje, lekin sarkaar par koi asar nahin padaa
 Both leaders said that the government has deliberately increased the price of pulses, so that it can be boiled at the center
 paswan ne kaha ki ki khaadya aapurti or upabhokta mantralay dwaara rajya sarkaar ko chaar patr likhe gaye, lekin kisi kaa jawaab nahin aayaa
 RJD President Lalu Prasad had said in a tweet that the pulses have become so expensive that even now the hen's pulse cannot be called idiom
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar chunavi sabhaaon main daal mahangi hone ke liye kendra sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 He is saying that the central government has completely failed in every case
 gujarat or madhya pradesh main daal kii keemat kyon badi he
 Meanwhile, a Hindi news paper published from Patna surveyed online about the increased price of pulses
 isamen is chunaav main padane vaale prabhaav ke vishay main poocha gaya tha
 Nearly 60 percent of the people in the survey said that inflation is directly related to the public
 adhikansh log ise centre kaa maamla maanate hai
 The BJP may suffer a lot in this election on the issue of pulses
 patna kii mamata kahati hai ki aaj chunaav kii vajah se bhale hi netaa daal kaa mudda uthaa rahe hon parantu hakeekat he ki mahangaai kaa sabase adhik maarmadhyamvargeey parivarako jhelana padataa he
 What should these leaders know about inflation? Manish says that it is a matter of which government, these people do not know, but pulses have disappeared from the plate
 daal aaj 200 rupee prati kilo bik rahaa he

 He is yet to be officially crowned as the number 2 in the Congress, but Rahul Gandhi is not waiting for any announcement
 pehali baar manch sanbhaalane ke aath saal baad party kaa netritv karne ke liye rahul taiyaar lag rahe hai, yaa shaayad taiyaar kar liye gaye hai
 At the Congress rally held in Delhi on 4 November, Rahul was presented as the keynote speaker along with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh
 unhone manmohan ke aarthik sudhaaron or khaadya suraksha bill jaisi sonia kii loklubhaavan yojanaon, donon kaa hi samarthan kiya
 Although Rahul had spoken in favor of FDI in retail in the Uttar Pradesh election campaign in 2011, this was his first time to get up in support of government policies at the national level
 rahul kii badi bhoomika camere ke saamne tak hi simit nahin he
 It has been more than a month, they spend an hour and a half every day with or without their mother, meeting party workers and leaders at 10 Janpath
 15 gurudwara rakabganj road sthit party ke waar room main bhi ve niyamit rup se jate hai
 According to a party general secretary, Rahul along with a select few leaders, including Sonia's loyalists and Team Rahul's people, has started strategizing for the next general elections
 in chuninda netaaon main sonia ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel, kendriya mantri jairam ramesh, mahasachiv digvijay singh, janardan dvivedi or madhusudan mistre shaamil hai
 This team is completely opposite to Rahul's earlier think tank
 tab unki dilchaspee mahaj party kii yuva shakhaon tak simit hua karti thi or unki baatcheet bhi jitendra singh, minakshi natarajan, deependra hooda or harish choudhary jaise nai peedi ke saansadon tak simit thi
 All these youth are members of the Congress Working Committee
 Chand is the only party member who talks to Rahul Gandhi every fortnight
 lekin idhar unhone mukhya party par dhyaan dena shuru kiya he
 Nowadays he is said to be busy in designing organizational reshuffle
 digvijay kehete hai, ‘‘team banane main unka puraa vishwaas he,’’ lekin ve yah bhi daawa karte hai ki unke paas nai team kakoi byoraa nahin he
 Sonia and Rahul are doing this and that is why the rest of the party does not know anything about it
 digvijay hansate hue kehete hai, ‘‘captain team ko chunata he, na ki team captain ko chunati he
 It is up to Rahulji to decide
 ’’digvijay majaak kar sakate hai
 Even after proving to be a boon in Uttar Pradesh, he remains an important member of Team Rahul

 On 19 October, on a tour of Punjab, Rahul met party workers in Jalandhar

 He says, "rahul has a futuristic modern agenda and he does not just believe in releases
" yah rahul ne hi sujhaayaa tha ki sarkaar ko apni 4 pratishat kharid chote or madhyam darje ke dalit udhyamiyon se karnaa anivaary banaaya janaa chahie

 yaad kariye, unhone parmaanu saude kaa bhi samarthan kiya tha
 He has no illusions on issues of economics and politics
 ve sudhaaron tathaa aarakshan donon kaa hi samarthan karte hai kyonki ve vanchiton ko samaan avasar uplabdh karwaanaa chaahate hai
 "but since Rahul rarely expresses his views, this is confined to a select few

 When the fifth day of play begins in the Adelaide Test, the eyes will be on the Indian batsmen
 chauthe din kaa khel khatm hone tak australia ne apni kul badhat 363 ranon kii kar lee he
 In such a situation, on the final day, Australia captain Michael Clarke declared the innings on 290 for five on the fourth day, then India would have a target of 364 runs
 match ke antim din or chauthi pari main ye lakshya kitna mushkil hoga, iskaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aaj tak edilade ke maidan par chauthi pari main jeet ke liye itane ran nahin bane hai
 The highest score to be won in Adelaide in the fourth innings is 315 runs
 ye lakshya 112 saal pehle, 1902 main australia ne england ke khilaaf hasil kiya tha, chah wicket par australian team ne 315 ran banaakar test jeeta tha
 Apart from this, seeing the way India's last five wickets fell in front of Nathan Lyon's spin on the fourth day, it seems that the final day is going to be a big test for the Indian batsmen
 kehane ko to kaha ja saktaa he, team india 90 overon ke khel main 364 ranon ke lakshya ko hasil kar sakati he, kyonki isi test ke tisare din ke khel main bharat 90 overon ke khel main 5 wicket par 369 ran banaae hai
 Not only this, India also has the record of scoring the most runs in the fourth innings of the Adelaide Test
 bharat ne 1978 main, edilade test kii chauthi pari main 445 ran banaae the
 The team lost the match by just 47 runs, but due to the brilliant batting of Mohinder Amarnath, Gundappa Vishwanath and Dilip Vengsarkar, the team reached the point of winning the match one time
 iske alaava 1991-92 main mohammad ajaharuddin kii shatkeey pari kii badaulat team india ne edilade main chauthi pari main 333 ran banaae the
 The Indian team then lost the match by just 38 runs
 2003-04 ke dauraan rahul dravid ne akele dam par bharat ke liye test jeetne kaa karishma dikhaaya tha
 Dravid led Team India to a four-wicket victory by scoring 233 runs in the first innings and 72 not out in the second innings
 tab bharat ne 233 ran banaakar match jeeta tha
 In such a situation, if Indian batsmen show struggle in Adelaide, then Team India can make history, the history of winning the Test by scoring the most runs in the fourth innings in Adelaide
 lekin iske liye shikhar dhawan, murali vijay, cheteshwar pujaara, viraat kohli, ajinkya rahane or rohit sharma ko apana puraa damakham dikhaanaa hoga
 Given the way the match is taking turn, this challenge looks extremely difficult, but history is made only after overcoming difficult challenges

 com / frc4angd0v Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal certainly approved raising the minimum wage in Delhi by almost 50 per cent on the occasion of Independence Day, but in the coming days it may become a new cause of controversy
 siem kejariwal ke elaan se pehle hi dilli ke kaarobaariyon ne achaanak itani mazdooree badhaane ke prastaav par apni aapatti darj kara di he
 The Federation of Indian Chambers and Commerce of India (FICCI) has written a letter warning Delhi Labor Minister Gopal Rai not to do so
 kaarobaariyonke is sangh kii ore se secretary jaranal dow e didaar singh ne ye chitthee likhi he
 The letter mentions that due to the 46 per cent increase, small and small businesses in Delhi may have to suffer terrible losses as these are the sectors which provide maximum employment in Delhi
 padosi rajyon kii tulana main pehle se nunatam mazdooree zyadafikki kii is chitthee main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki aakhirkaar dilli ke padosi rajyon menunatam mazdooreekithni he
 In Delhi, wages in different categories are already 30 to 32 per cent higher than in Punjab
 vahiin haryana kii tulana main dilli kii mazdooree pehle se 19 se lekar 26 pratishat tak adhik he
 In Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, this difference is widened elsewhere
 uttar pradesh kii tulana main dilli main alag-alag shreniyon ke mazdooron ko 32 se 35 fisadi mazdooree zyada milti he to rajasthan or dilli kii nunatam mazdooree kaa antar to 64 se lekar 84 pratishat tak he
 After this, a 46 percent increase is now proposed in Delhi
 ye antar kai guna or bad jayega
 At the same time, it will be difficult to implement this proposal because it will be more difficult to keep an eye on whether the employers are paying minimum wages or not
 bhrashtachar kii gunjaaish bani rahegi
 What will be the impact of this? If the association of businessmen is to be believed, this will give another big blow to the businessmen in Delhi
 wo apana bijness samet kar baahar jane ko majaboor ho jaaenge
 That is, even before Kejriwal's announcement, the businessmen had flagged off this proposal
 iske baavjood na sirf kejariwal ne swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par is yojana kaa elaan kiya balki isi hafte ye prastaav cabinet se paas karaane kii bhi taiyaari he
 According to the sources of the Delhi government, many departments of the government have objected to this proposal of the Labor Department
 cabinet main prastaav paas bhi ho gaya to uparajyapal ke paas pahunch kar is prastaav par brake lag saktaa he
 Knowing all these things, Kejriwal has taken the risk of bringing this proposal so that he can give a message among the workers that they are engaged for their good
