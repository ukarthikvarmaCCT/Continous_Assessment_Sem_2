 In return, when Kiran Bedi was accused of corruption through ngos, Modi supporters also kept quiet
 tabhi se gujarat main raajnneeti kii samaj rakhane vaale sabhi logon ko yah pataa chal gaya tha ki modi or bedi saath-saath hai
 But despite this, as much as i understand Modi, it is not enough that Modi should offer someone as the Chief Minister's chair
 unke saath chunavi ganit hameshaa se rajnatik dosti par haaavee rahata aayaa he, or is baar bhi baat kuch waisi hi he
 Modi and Shah always monitor elections very closely
 in donon kii aadat rahi he ki unase yaa unki pratishtha se jude har chunaav main ve apane taur par surveykshan karavaate hai, or media ke chunavi surveykshanon par zyaada bharosa nahin karte
 This time too, he must have got an internal survey done and he would probably be close to the media coming in
 yani, kejariwal bijepi ko kadi takkar zarur de rahe honge
 The road to victory in Delhi will not be that easy, hence the need for some extra push would have been felt even at the cost of resentment of its workers
 narendra modi gujarat or loksabhaa chunaavon main ummid se zyaada vot isiilie pate rahe hai, kyonki mukhyamantri yaa pradhanmantri pad ke liye vah logon kii pehali pasand rahe hai, or dilli main bijepi ko siten bhale hi zyaada mil rahi hon, lekin mukhyamantri pad kii daud main kejariwal sabase aage rahe hai or yahi vajah he ki modi or shah ko ek dar zarur rahaa hoga ki kahin yah factor aakhri samay main aam aadmi party ko bijepi ke mukaable laakar khadaa na kar de
 And it is also true that in politics you may win 10 elections, but one defeat, and your popularity starts to be affected
 agar dilli main bijepi jeet nahin pai to yah charchaa shuru ho hi jaaegi ki modi kaa karishma ghatane laga he, jo modi or shah, donon ke liye behad nagavar lamhaa hoga
 That is why something had to be done so that a strong bet would be put in place, and the factor which was the biggest weakness was corrected
 aravind kejariwal kii mukhyamantri pad kii lokapriyata ke mukaable mukhyamantri pad kaa koi aisa ummidavaar, jo aam logon ko bhi lage, takkar kaa he
 
 
 
 or sirf isiilie apano ko naaraaz karke bhi ek faisla le liya gaya
 
 
 Modi chose Bedi
 
 
 so, ab dekhnaa he ki is baar modi kaa yah ganit kitna safal ho paata he

 SFIO ne apni jaanch main paaya ki infrastracchar lijing and financial services (IL&FS) ke sheersh prabandhan ke nirdesh par ye sabhi lone die gaye
 These include a personal loan of Rs 29 crore given to Anupama Agarwal, wife of Rishi Aggarwal, promoter of ABG Group
 IL&FS ne in lone ko dene ke liye jaruri nirdhaarit prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya
 According to Business Standard news, tremendous arbitrariness was done in this case
 ABG ne IL&FS se kuch lone isliye liya taaki apane khaaton ko non-parforming asset yani enpie banane se roak sake
 IL&FS had been giving loans to Rishi Aggarwal's company ABG since 2010 and the total debt on it is about Rs 1,080 crore
 is karj ko sitambar 2018 main enpie ghoshit kiya gaya
 Significantly, the Reserve Bank also warned in its report that adequate security cover was not taken in loans given to ABG International and Oneway Industries
 SFIO ko pataa chalaa he ki yah karj 13 lone khaaton main diya gaya
 The report said that Rishi Aggarwal, promoter of ABG Group, used to exchange e-mails directly with Ravi Parthasarathy, the then chairman of IL&FS
 yani is maamle main sheersh prabandhan kii mileebhagat thi
 Earlier in April, SFIO arrested Hari Sankaran, former Vice Chairman of Sankat IL&FS
 unhen dhokhadhadi main shaamil hone tathaa company tathaa uske karjadaataaon ko nuksaan pahunchane ke evaj main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Shankaran was arrested in Mumbai in connection with the ongoing investigation against IL&FS and its group units
 shankaran ko IL&FS financial services li
 Was arrested for misusing his powers
 un par aarope he ki vah dhokhadhadi main shaamil hue or waisi ikaayiyon ko karj die, jo karj dene laayak nahin the tathaa unhen gaiyr-nishpadit parisampatti (enpie) ghoshit kiya gaya
 This caused loss to the company and its lenders
 IL&FS main vittiya aniyamitata kaa khulaasa tab hua jab pichley saal samooh kii kuch companiyaan karj waapas karne main diphalt karne lageen
 Due to this default, the company has been given a default rating, falling from a high rating in the financial market
 sarkaar ne company board kaa techover kar liya he or company ko sucharu tareeke se chalaane ke liye ek samaadhaan yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 According to information received by India today-aaj Tak, the IL&FS group was beset with serious problems in early 2012
 vahiin 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle hi company ke paas badi sankhya main khatai main pade projects ekatra ho gaye
 Sources claimed that due to upa's policy paralysis, the work was done to keep these projects alive through debt financing

 In the terrorist attack on Parliament on 13 December 2001, a total of 9 people including guards of Parliament House, Delhi Police personnel were killed
 15 saal pehle aaj hi ke din sansad par aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 On that day, five terrorists in a white ambassador's car had shaken the entire Hindustan by pillaging the largest temple of democracy in 45 minutes
 ham aapako bataane ja rahe hai sansad par hamale kii puri kahani minute dar minute:taarikh-13 disambar, 2001samay-subah 11 bajkar 28 minatesthaan-sansad bhawan, dillisansadke sheetakaaleen satr kii sargharmiyaan tej thim
 The proceedings of both the houses had been adjourned for 40 minutes following a fierce uproar by the opposition
 sadan sthagit hote hi pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or vipaksh kii netaa sonia gandhi loksabhaa se nikal kar apane-apane sarkari nivas ke liye kooch kar chake the
 Many mps had also left
 par grih mantri laalkrishna adwani apane kai saathi mantriyon or lagbhag 200 saansadon ke saath ab bhi loksabhaa main hi maujuud the
 As usual, there was a whole media gathering inside the Lok Sabha premises, by then many mps and Ministers had also come out from inside the House and were enjoying the warm sun
 samay-subah 11 bajkar 29 minatesthaan-sansad bhawan kaa get number 11uparashtrapati krishnakanth sharma ke car ke kafile main tainaat suraksharmi ab sadan se unke baahar aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 And at that very moment, a white ambassador car accelerates towards the vice presidential convoy
 sansad bhawan ke andar aane vaali gadiyon kii tay raftaar se isaki raftaar kahin zyada tej thi
 One could only understand that Jagdish Yadav, a Lok Sabha security worker, was seen running behind the car
 wo lagaataar car ko rukne kaa ishaara kar rahe the
 Seeing Jagdish Yadav running wildly, Vice President's security guards ASI Jeet Ram, ASI Nanak Chand and ASI Shyam Singh also sneak towards him in an attempt to stop the ambassador car
 surakshakarmiyon ko apni ore aata dekh ambesder car kaa driver apni gaadi ko get number ek kii taraf mode detaa he
 The vice-president's car was parked near gate number one
 tej raftaar or mode kii vajah se car kaa driver niyantran kho detaa he or gaadi sidhe uparashtrapati kii car se ja takaraati he
 Time-11 in the morning, 30 minutes place-gate No
 1, Parliament House Now someone could understand that only when the four doors of the ambassador open simultaneously and the five fidayeen sitting in the car go out in the blink of an eye and start firing indiscriminately
 paanchon eke-47 se las the
 The five had bags on their back and shoulders
 pehali baar aatank loktantr kii dahalij paar kar chukaa tha
 The entire Parliament building was echoed by a flurry of bullets, four security personnel who were trying to stop the ambassador car became the victims of the first attack of terrorists
 par sansad bhawan main maujuud baaki logon ko abhi bhi pataa nahin tha ki kya hua yaa kya ho rahaa he
 Most people considered the sound of gunfire as the noise of firecrackers
 kisi ne vahamo-gumaan main bhi nahin so tha ki sansad bhawan ke andar bhiaatankvadighus sakate hai
 But then only then comes a blast sounding in the midst of gunfire
 goliyon kii gunj ke baad pehla dhamaakaa ye elaan kar chukaa tha ki duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke mandir yani sansad bhawan par hamalaa ho chukaa he
 Amidst the clamor of the gunfire and the blast of the blasts, the picture was clear in a moment after seeing the security personnel falling on the bloodied ground
 or ab sansad bhawan ke andar chaaron taraf afra-tafari or dehshat kaa maahaul tha
 Whichever corner was visible, he was running away
 ab bhi goliyon kii aawaaj sabase zyada get number 11 kii taraf se hi aa rahi thi
 The five terrorists were still showering bullets and grenades from around the ambassador's car
 tabhi aatankwaadiyon ko get number 11 kii taraf jamaa dekh sansad bhawan ke suraksha karmi dilli police or siarpief ke javaanon ke saath get number 11 kii taraf badhate hai
 Now firing had started from both sides
 golibari se mahaj kuch sau meter kii duuri par maujuud grahamantri laalkrishna adwani ko bhi tab tak hamale kii khabar mil chuki thi
 Therefore, all senior ministers including LK Advani and Defense Minister George Fernandez were immediately taken to safe places inside the house
 iske saath hi sadan ke andar jane vaale tamaam daravaaje bhi band kar die jate hai or vahaan surakshakarmi apni-apni pojishan le lete hai
 On the other hand, seeing the security personnel moving towards gate number 11, the five terrorists also start changing their positions
 paanch main se ek aatanvaadi goliyaan chalaata hua ab get number 1 kii taraf bhaagta he
 While the remaining four try to move towards gate number 12
 aatankwaadiyon kii koshish kisi tarah sadan ke daravaaje tak pahunchane kii thi taaki wo sadan ke andar ghus saken
 But the security personnel had already taken their positions around all the doors
 iske alaava aatankwaadi jis tarah goliyaan barasaate hue idha-udhi bhaag rahe the usase saaf lag rahaa tha ki ve andar to ghus aae hai par unhen ye pataa nahin he ki sadan ke andar daakhil hone ke liye daravaaje kis taraf hai?isi afra-tafari ke bich ek aatankwaadi jo get number 1 kii taraf badha tha vahiin se goliyaan barsaata hua sadan ke andar jane ke liye sansad bhawan ke galiyare se hote hue ek daravaaje kii taraf badhata he
 But before he succeeds in his attempt, he is shot by security forces
 goli lagate hi get number ek ke kareeb galiyare main hi daravaaje se kuch dur wo gir padataa he
 The first terrorist had fallen
 par abhi wo jinda tha
 The security personnel were still avoiding getting close to him despite taking him completely under target
 kyonki dar ye tha ki kahin wo khud ko uda na ne
 And this fear of security personnel was not wrong either
 kyonki jameen par girane ke kuch hi pal baad jab us aatankwaadi ko laga ki ab wo ghir chukaa he to usne fouran remote dabaa kar khud ko uda liya
 He tied a bomb to his body
 chaar aatanki ab bhi jinda the
 Not only were they alive, but were constantly running away indiscriminately
 aisa lagata tha maano ve ghanton muqabla karne kii taiyaari ke saath aae the
 Because they had a full range of bullets, bombs and grenades
 jo wo apane sharir main chupa kar or kandhe par tange bag main lekar aae the
 Till now the attack had already been reported to NSG commandos and army
 aatankwaadiyon se nipatane main maahir dilli police kii special cell kii team bhi sansad bhawan ke liye kooch kar chuki thi
 But the live operation in the Parliament House was still going on
 news channel ke jariye hamale kii khabar ab desh-videsh tak fail chuki thi
 Meanwhile, perhaps the remaining four terrorists had also reported the death of one of their companions
 shaayad ye khabar unhen us dhamaake se mili thi jo remote ke jariye ek aatankwaadi ne khud ko uda kar kiya tha
 So the rest of the terrorists became more nervous now
 ghabrahat main ab chaaron aatankwaadi idhar-udhar bhaagate hue chupane kaa thikaana dhundne lage
 On the other hand, the security personnel had now started surrounding the terrorists from all four sides
 golibari ab bhi jari thi
 And then in the meantime another good news came from gate number five
 ek or aatankwaadi surakshakarmi kii goliyon se dher ho chukaa tha
 Now three terrorists left
 un teenon ko acchhee tarah pataa tha ki wo sansad bhawan se zindaa batch kar nahin nikal sakate
 So he also made one last attempt to go inside the house
 ve goliyaan barasaate hue dhire-dhire get number 9 kii taraf badhane lage
 But the security personnel surrounded him near gate number nine
 samay-din ke kareeb 12
 At 10 o'clock, place-gate 9, Parliament House, now the entire operation was confined near Gate No
 9
 donon taraf se lagaataar goliyaan chal rahi thim
 In between, terrorists were also throwing grenades on security personnel
 par chunki ve chaaron taraf se ghir chuke the lihaaja ab bachane kaa koi rasta nahin tha
 And finally after a while, all the three terrorists were piled up

 Sometimes it is unknown that we give such injury to our partner, which causes the distance in the relationship

 You will also want that everything goes well between you and your partner and there should never be any rift in the relationship
 aisa ho saktaa he par iske liye aapako bhi kuch baaten dhyaan main rakhni hongi
 Appreciate your partner: You know that your partner loves you very much and also takes care of you
 beshak aap bhi unhe chaahate hai par kya aap un choti–choti chizon ke liye unka shukriya adaa karte hai jo wo aapke liye sachche dil se karte hai

 Do not make unnecessary demands to test them
 aapke zyada nakhre dikhaane se aapke saathi chidchide bhi ho sakate hai
 Consider your own fault: Do not put the blame of any mistake on your partner
 agar aapako lagata he ki thodi si hi sahi par aapaki bhi galati he, to use sweekaar karen
 In the case of both of you, it is easy to just put your partner in the dock, but it will hurt them a lot
 shaayad isse wo tut bhi sakate hai
 On the other hand, if you also accept your mistake and explain with love then they will feel good and they will not feel alone
 gile shikave dur karen:agar aapako apane partner kii koi baat buree lagati he to chup naa rahen
 In that case, talk openly
 zyaadaatar log saathi ko is baat kaa ehsaas bhi nahin hone dete hai ki unhe unki baat buree lagi he
 Remove gimmicks from your partner rather than being alone
 saathi ko nazarandaaj kar aap unhen to dukhi karte hi hai, khud ko bhi chot pahunchaate hai
 Do not raise excessive expectations: Do you expect too much from your partner? Do you also want them to have low expectations from you? Whether your relationship is with husband or wife or girlfriend-boyfriend, you do not have the right to expect more by giving less attention to your partner
 isliye rishton main iskaa saamanjasy banaae rakhen
 Keep in mind the choice of your partner: Do you have the habit of doing everything according to your mind! If you are just watching movies of your choice, just going to visit or eat at the place of your choice then be careful

 By taking care of these small things, you can handle your shattering relationship and always remain close to your partner
 apane rishton main nae rang bharte rahen or ise itnaa swasth or majboot banaaen taaki ta-umr aap isaki mithaas ko mahasoos kar saken

 In Uttar Pradesh, party president Rahul Gandhi has made his biggest bet to revive the Congress lying on the ventilator before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye rahul ne apane sabase do khaas logon priyanka gandhi or jiyotiraditya sindhiya ko morche par utaar diya he
 Rahul knows that if he wants to win the country, first he has to win UP
 priyanka gandhi ke raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke saath hi unhen purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he to pashchim upi kaa prabhaar jyotiraditya sindhiya ke kandhon par he
 In such a situation, there is a big challenge between the two leaders
 43 seat sindhiya or 37 seat priyanka ke jimmebta den ki uttar pradesh kii kul 80 loksabhaa siton main se agar lakhanu ko central point maanate hai to pashchim upi main 43 or purvanchal main 37 loksabhaa siten aati hai
 In this way Jyotiraditya Scindia has got more seats than Priyanka Gandhi
 iske alaava 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhen to pashchim upi main ek bhi seat congress ko nahin mili thi
 While the two seats in Congress account are Amethi and Rae Bareli also in Purvanchal's account
 itnaa hi nahin is baar ke loksabhaa ke chunaav main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne bhi in donon siton par apane ummidavaar ko nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 This announcement has made Priyanka's path even easier
 sindhiya ke liye upi nayaa, priyanka pehle se sakriyauttar pradesh kii siyaasi ranbhumi priyanka gandhi ke liye nai nahin he
 Since 1999, Priyanka has been leading the election campaign in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 iske chalate aasapaas ke jilon main bhi unka prabhaav rahaa he
 Organizations of both districts and maintain constant contact with the people of the area
 soobe main 'priyanka lao-upi bachaao' ke poster kai baar lag chuke hai
 At the same time, Jyotiraditya Scindia has been active in the politics of Madhya Pradesh, West UP is new for him
 yahaan na to party ke netaaon se bahut zyada pahchaan he or na hi is ilaake kaa koi anubhav he
 Better in the West than in Purvanchal in 2014, however, considering the results of the last Lok Sabha election, eastern Uttar Pradesh is more challenging for Priyanka than Scindia
 kushinagar or pratapgarh loksabhaa seat ko chhodkar party purvanchal ke kisi bhi seat par behatar chunaav nahin lard saki thi
 Whereas in eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Congress was successful in getting more than one lakh votes in seats like Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Dhaurahra, Rampur
 iske alaava kai siten thim, jahaan party ek lakh ke kareeb vot pai thi
 Jyotiraditya's fight against akhilesh-maya, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati has the highest base in West UP, as both leaders come from the same region
 in donon partiyon ne gathbandhan kiya he or mana ja rahaa he choudhary ajit singh kii party areldi bhi iskaa hissaa ban sakati he
 In such a situation, the alliance is looking very heavy in terms of caste equation
 is tarah se sindhiya ko congress kii jameen ko majboot karne ke liye akhilesh or mayawati se muqabla karnaa hoga
 Priyanka Gandhi's contest is modi-yogi Sevay, a strong stronghold of eastern Uttar Pradesh BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi banaras se saansad hai or siem yogi adityanath gorakhpur se aate hai
 Apart from this, BJP state president Mahendranath Pandey also comes from Purvanchal
 is tarah se priyanka gandhi ko modi-yogi se sidhe muqabla karnaa hoga
 However, this area has been a strong Congress stronghold at one time
 in ilaakon se aane vaale kamalapati treepathi or vir bahadur singh jaise netaa congress kii ore se siem rahe hai
 Through Priyanka, the Congress wants to overcome its destiny by helping Brahmins in Purvanchal
 pashchim main jitau ummidavaar kii kamiloksabhaa chunaav main mahaj teen maheene se bhi kam vakt bachaa hua he
 In such a situation, the responsibility of reviving the Congress party in western UP will be on the shoulders of Scindia and it is also a big challenge for the party to find the winning candidates
 mujffarnagar, meerut, kairana, bijanour, rampur, sanbhal, amroha, gautamabuddhanagar, muradabad, aligarh or agra jaisi siton par jitau candidet congress ke paas najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Although there is a similar problem in Purvanchal, but the way the party is showing enthusiasm after Priyanka Gandhi's arrival, this problem of Congress can be overcome

 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and fast bowler Ishant Sharma got two wickets each
 england kaa score ek samay ek wicket par 68 ran tha, lekin usne aakhri nau wicket 87 ran ke andar ganvaa diye
 India's batting did not start well
 ajinkya rahane (shunya) ne pari ke tisare over main hi steven fin kii gend ko andar ghusane kaa rasta de diya jisane unka aaf stump ukhada
 Gambhir shared a 67-run partnership with Kohli but he made an easy catch at mid-on in an effort to make a long shot off spinner James Treadwell
 gambhir ne 53 gend kheli tathaa chaar chauke lagaaye
 Kohli, who performed poorly in the last few matches, was in full mood today
 unhone jade darnbak par lagaataar teen chauke jadkar shuruyaat kii tathaa baad main fin kii lagaataar do gendon ko seemaa rekha ke darshan karaaye
 Kohli completed 4000 runs in odis as soon as he completed his 49th run
 yah unka 96waan match or 93veen pari he or is tarah se viv richards (88 pari) ke baad vah sabase kam pariyon main is mukaam par pahunchane vaale ballebaaj bane
 Viewers wanted Dhoni to come down to the crease and show him the helicopter shot but Kohli and Yuvraj too did not disappoint him
 kohli ne tradewell par do chakke lagaaye to yuvaraj ne darnbak ke do overon main chaar chauke lagaakar unhen kadaa sabak sikhaaya
 When Treadwell bowled Yuvraj, the audience was happy because now Dhoni had come to the crease
 bhartiya captain ne fin kii gend ko deep squaire leg par chaar ran ke liye bhejkar jeet kii aupchaarikta puri kii
 Dhoni remained unbeaten after scoring ten runs
 bel ne bhi bhubaneshwar par squaire drive or hook se chauke jadkar lay pakadi
 Peterson hit Ishant for two consecutive fours in the next over
 lekin aise main bhartiya ampire es ravi ne bharat ko petersan (17) kaa keemtee wicket dilaa diya
 Ishant changed his end and his fifth ball came up to Dhoni touching Peterson's shirt
 ravi ne turant hi ungali uthaa di
 Peterson was not convinced and he stood at the crease for a while
 dhoni ne agle over main bhubaneshwar kii gend par bel kaa mushkil kaich liya jisase england kaa score teen wicket par 68 ran ho gaya
 Ashwin had Eoin Morgan (10) caught by Yuvraj Singh while Jadeja sent Craig Keyswetter and Samit Patel in the one over

 arun jetali jitani farrotedaar angreji bolte hai utani hi acchhee hindi bhi
 But this time the general budget has proved that they also speak Hinglish
 aam bajet ke dauraan vitt mantri ne bhashaa kii ek nai parampara hi shuru kar di
 Now what was their motive behind speaking such a hybrid language, know this only? But a lot of speculations are being made about this
 kaha to yah bhi ja rahaa he ki gujarat ke gaanvon se mili chunavi pratikriya ko dekhakar ranneeti ke tahat gaanvon ke logon ko rijhaane ke liye jetali ne bhashaa main hindi kaa joardaar tadakaa lagaaya
 However, a day before Jaitley's speech, the 'annual Global Democracy Index' was released
 isamen bharat 167 deshon kii suchi main 32wein se khiskkar 42wein number par aa gaya tha
 And for the first time India had joined the line of countries with hybrid democracy instead of democracy
 yani idhar jetali kii bhashaa hybrid hui udhar bharat hybrid democratic
 ! Well, the matter of the general budget
 gujarat main graminon kii ghudki kaa asar isamen saaf jhalka
 Rural Gujarat was instrumental in making the BJP stand close to defeat there
 yani bhaajapa ko ilham ho gaya he ki aane vaale chunaavon main gaanvon kii dagar aasaan nahin
 Villages will not be easy After the Gujarat elections, lokniti-csds presented an analysis
 uske mutabik gujarat chunaav main graminon ne bhaajapa ko lagbhag nakaar diya
 Only 36 of the 98 seats in the rural area came from it
 puri 57 siten congress le gai
 The difference in seats creates a solid basis for saying that rural Gujarat, especially the farmers, is not happy with the BJP
 is saal aath rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav
 Obviously, the rural areas of these states can also present a big challenge for the BJP
 aage kaa vishleshan visheshgyon ke liye hi chhod diya jaae
 The concern of rural India, seen in the budget, gave a big gift to the farmers in the general budget this time
 jetali ne 2018-19 ke liye kharif kii fasal ke liye chaunkaane vaale nunatam samarthan mulya kaa elaan kiya
 In the budget, a provision was made to give farmers one and a half times the cost of the crop
 -food processing sector ke liye 1400 karod ru
 Provided aalu or pyaaj ke utpaadan ke liye oparation green chalaane kii baat kahi
 500 crore for this
 kaa elaan kiya
 2000 crores for the development of agriculture market
 kaa praavdhaan kiya jayega
 - Said to build a mega food park
 -gaanvon main 22 hajaar haaton ko krishi bazaar main tabdeel karne kii bhi ghoshnaa kii
 - Targeted to reach 100 billion dollars of agricultural products exports
 yah sari yojanaayen kitni safal hongi yah to arthshaastri vishleshan ke baad hi bataa paaenge
 But the way the budget and the concerns of the villages and farmers appeared, one thing is clear that the BJP does not want the situation like Gujarat in the elections of eight states to be held next year and general elections in 2019
 isiilie ruthe kisaanon or graminon ko manaane main vah koi kasar nahin rakhana chaahati
 Enthusiasm is different when you get the first job in a new city
 vetan or bhatton jaisi mahatpurna chizon par molbhav karte samay jis garv kii anubhuti hoti he, vah bhaavana beshkeemtee hoti he
 In a moment you grow up
 sayaane ho jate hai
 And then comes the clock of time - time to shift from one city to another
 maa ke haath kaa khaanaa or bachapan ke yaar- in sabase dur ek anjaan, nae shahar main shift karnaa tanaavpurn lag saktaa he
 Many questions arise in the mind, many things are tense - where will you live? Where to collect furniture? Who will help in times of need? We tell you some ways you can easily overcome all these problems: 1
 sabase mahatvapurn: sahi makaan kii talashkisi nae shahar main pahunchane ke baad kaaphi pareshaani hoti he, samaj nahin aata ki kahaan rahen, apane liye ghar kii khoj kahan se shuru karen
 The best way to do this is to book a house before booking your ticket
 apane offis ke aasapaas ke ilaake main hi talash karen
 If the house is found near your new office, then you will save both your travel time and money
 agar aapkaa bajet simit he to bhi koi baat nahin, duusare behtareen vikalp chune or yah sunishchit karen ki yah aisa ilaaka ho, jo public transport se acchhee tarah se judaa ho or uske aasapaas sabhi buniyadi suvidhaayen hon
 Also, unless you have market rates and other information available, do not try to view the property through a broker
 aisa karne par aapako zyada kiraaya dena pad saktaa he
 2
 furniture kii dikkatayadi phuli fernishd makaan dekhte hai to aapako furniture kii chintaa se mukti mil jaaegi
 With this, you will not have to spend any kind of money to buy basic furniture and with this savings you can get the luxury of buying some extra household items
 is tarah aap ghar se dur hone par bhi ghar jaisi ek jagah banane main safal honge
 Not only this, at the time of leaving the house, you will be saved from the problem and expense of shifting furniture
 3
 Who likes to be alone? Do you also want to have roommates partying with you when you get your first salary, with whom you share the expenses of the month and complete the household chores together? You have to make this decision
 nae shahar main akelepan se bachanaa he to shering vaala flats len
 Yes, it may end a little privacy, but at least at the end of the month you will not be sitting alone, sad, nor will it affect your performance
 4
 What to do to get to and from the office
 Living in a new city means that neither you will have a father's car, nor will you have your favorite bike (yes, if you bring your bike with you, then it is something else
 !) Therefore, it is important that you already understand the means of transport of the new city, take the services of the nearest means available to your house
 aakhirkaar aapako apni nai naukari ke liye samay pe pahunchnaa he or apane seniors kii najar main ek dirghakaalik acchhee chhavi banani he
 Wouldn't you like that? So decide which route to take for your office
 bas / metro / local train aadi kii puri timming aapako yaad rakhni chahie
 Luckily if your roommates' office is also around your office, or you work in the same office, you can also opt for pooling with them
 5
 Create a professional contact Once you are set up, start making contacts with people who can help you progress in your profession
 isamen aapke flats ke partner bhi kaam aa sakate hai
 Having different professional backgrounds and varied experience, they can help you to connect with people who can open doors of new opportunities in the near future through their knowledge and contacts
 yah aapke liye flats share karne kii ek or vajah ho sakati he
 You can get the option of hundreds of houses from Google, but how to decide which house, which area to choose in the new, unknown city? There is panic, tension also
 yadi aap is tanaav ko dur karne kaa aasaan tarika chaahate hai tonescvaper uplabdh property ko dekhen or ghar baithe hi dhunde apane pasand kaa ashiana
 On this, you can save a brokerage by finding a house, at the same time you have to give only 2 months security deposit instead of the prevailing 10 months
 yahi nahin, isamen aapako fernishd apartment ke tamaam aise vikalp milte hai, jahaan aap apane tarah ke logon ke saath room yaa flats share kar sakate hai
 How easy is it? So make complete preparations and fly with success for future life

 However, Unitech protested, saying that the company did not have the money so the construction work was stopped
 jabaki supreme court main graahakon kii ore se kaha gaya ki kaaphi vakt se kaam band he or nirmaan kaary ek inch nahin hua

 google par ek saadhaaran search karne se hi pataa chal jayega ki jahaan bhi bahutayat main hai, musalmaan hi zyaadaatar musalamaanon ko maar rahe hai, islam ke naam par
 This causes many questions and demands answers
 1
 If this is the religion of peace then why slaughtering? 2
 agar har majahab acha he lekin uske maanane vaale majahab ko badnaam kar rahe hai to phir hindu duusare hinduon ko kyon nahin maar rahe, musalamaanon kii tarah?3
 Why did Hindus have to flee the Kashmir Valley? Just because they were in the minority? 4
 sabase khatarnaak majahabi dangon gujarat 2002, mumbai 1993 or bhagalpur 1989 ke dauraan bhi musalamaanon ko kahin hameshaa ke liye palaayan karne kii jarurat kyon nahin padi?5
 The answer lies in the hidden psyche behind making Pakistan, which has an impact on a large section of Indian Muslims
 imam bukhari musalamaanon ke liye ek or alag desh banane kii dhamkee yun hi nahin dete hai
 6
 to niyam saaf hai-i) sankhya kam he to loktantr kaa hissaa bane raho, use jhel jaao
 ii) If there is a minority in the right number then first carry out the terrorist incident and then tell yourself to be a terrorist victim
 iii) jab bahusankhyak ho to baaki logon ko do hi vikalp do - dharmantaran yaa desh nikaala
 Or force yourself to face a life of exile in your own country, as happened with Kashmiri Pandits

 dilli main yah garmiyon ke shuruaati din hai
 The sun shines day by day, the winds are hot and the sky is soaked with dust
 is bich desh kii rajdhani mausam se adhik siyaasi tapish se tap rahi he
 If the general elections are in the country, then the capital will be affected
 upar suraj or neeche siyasati jabaani jang se dochaar dilli vaale hai, ki apane main mast hai
 Babasta from this war of words, but also nonchalant
 vaise bhi ye shabd bade betaratib se hai
 
 
 Delhi has always been the winner, so it is of no importance to them
 vah itihaas banaati he, itihaas gadhati he
 The history from which 'literature' is made
 isiilie bangladesh kii nirvasit lekhika tasalima nasrin se baatcheet kaa mauka aayaa, to lapak liya
 Taslima is famous all over the world for her revolutionary ideas
 unki aaazaad khayali or nirbhikta ne unhen ek antaheen nirvaasan kaa swaad chakhaaya he, phir bhi vah kabhi chup nahin rahi
 She has long faced opposition from religious fundamentalists, raising issues such as humanism, human rights, women's freedom and atheism
 unamem duniya bhar main ho rahe siyaasi badlaaon kii gahari samaj he
 In such a situation it was difficult to talk to him only in the realm of literature
 tasalima nasrin se mulaakaat kaa sabab bani haalia kitaab 'besaram'
 Besharam is the answer story of Taslima Nasreen's famous novel Lajja
 prakaashak raajakmal prakaashan ne yah mulaakaat tay karai thi
 Lajja is Taslima's book published in 1993, due to which he was expelled
 vah darbadar kar di gayi
 He has been exiled from Bangladesh since the publication of 'lajja'
 
 
 or nirvaasan kaa yah silsilaa, nirvaasan dar nirvaasan jari he
 Meanwhile, she has visited a large part of Europe
 phir bhi antat unhen rihaaish ke liye bharat hi pasand aayaa
 India, and also West Bengal is like a second home for them due to linguistic affiliation, but one day Taslima was also expelled from Kolkata, West Bengal
 
 
 aise main dilli unka thikaana bana
 Taslima lives in a crowded area of south Delhi
 pataa unki suraksha ke lihaaj se gopneey he
 Delhi Police personnel are deployed in security, but usually the number of people who meet Taslima who likes her privacy is so low that even the security personnel are comfortable
 isiilie kisi ke aane par surakshakarmi zyada chaunkate nahin
 They know in advance that the visiting time must have come
 baavjood iske ve mulaakaati ko colbel nahin dabaane dete
 They say that if you have taken time, call yourself and open the door
 aisa karnaa baadhyataa he
 But as soon as the bell rings on the mobile, two big eyes peep out of the door of the door
 bina bole hi kaaphi kuch bolti si
 Upon entering, you are in a very elegant drawing room adorned with paintings and books
 vahaan se jis taraf bhi najar daaliye, painting or kitaaben
 
 
 Bengali impression on the decor of the house, you admire them that Taslima brings some cold drink
 tasalima ko dekh ekbargi yah ahsaas hi nahin hota ki aap lekhan jagat kii antarrashtriya khyaati kii us shakhsiyat se mil rahe ho, jisaki jaan par khatra he! ki jisane apni abhivyakti kii aazaadee, lekhan or aurat ke sammaan main nirvaasan manjuur kiya maafee nahin, ki jiske samarthak pathakon kii ginati karodon main he, ki jo aaj in halaaton main bhi behad nidar he, ki jiske liye aazaadee or samanta kaa matlab har stri kii samanta, har stri kii aaazaad khayali, jisamen antat maanavmaatr kii aazaadee nihit he
 Excerpts from the conversation with Taslima Nasreen: 1
 aapke lekhak banane kii prakriya kab shuru hui?teraa saal kii thi, jab maine kavita likhnaa shuru kiya
 These poems also started appearing in local literary magazines
 bangala bhashaa main yuva lekhakon ko protsaahan dene vaali aisi patrikaon kii bharmaar he
 These magazines expressed freedom of expression and ideas
 main jab kolkata main yojit pustak melon main aati thi, to aisi saikadon patrikaayen dekhati thim
 i was so impressed with these journals that at the age of seventeen, i got myself a magazine
 isamen main nae lekhakon ko mauka detii
 It would be edited by itself
 prakaashan ke liye paise mere bhai dete
 In this way, my writing continued forever
 main medicine kii student thi
 His course is very long, so i stopped writing in the third year
 par jab main ek baar doctor ho gai, to maine phir se likhnaa shuru kar diya
 2
 lekhan kshetra main aapke preranarot koun hai?main apane bade bhai se prabhavit thi
 He used to take out magazines, and he always encouraged me to write
 1986 or 1989 main meri kavita kii kitaaben ain
 Among these, my second book was a huge success
 iske kai sanskaran chape
 After that i was approached by several newspaper editors to write the column
 main mahilaon kii sthiti par aadhaarit kollam likhane lagi
 This increased the scope of my contact
 3
 When the idea of writing 'lajja' came to mind, did you know that there would be such a reaction about it? Have to face exile? i used to write columns
 apni patrikaon ke sampadakon ke kehane par maine upanyaas bhi likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Many of my books were published
 1992 main jab babari masjid dhahi, tab bangladesh main uski pratikriya dekh main dang rah gai
 i saw the oppression of Hindus with my own eyes
 mujhe laga ye kattarpanthi aisa kaise kar sakate hai
 Many of my friends were Hindus
 mere marij bhi hindu the
 i went to their homes
 is halaat ne mujhe andar tak aahat kar diya tha
 i started collecting information, in the form of a document and data
 keval tathyon par aadhaarit
 But all these were so frightening that i thought of telling it to the world and thus 'lajja' was printed in 1993
 4
 'lajja' brought you immense fame, and also gave you an endless struggle
 aap ise lekar kya sochati hai?'lajja' mere bangladesh chhodane kii eklauti vajah nahin tha
 The fundamentalist Jamaat did not already agree with my views on women's freedom and their conditions
 parampara
 Practices, religion, thoughts were all against me
 ve meri soch ke khilaaf the
 They were against my views on the oppression of minorities by the majority
 5
 You have called 'besharam' a sequel to 'lajja', while 'lajja' had Bangladesh in the background, and India in 'besharam'? What is your message from both books? i did not write these books for any message
 maine apane samay ke halaat ko in kitabon main likhaa
 When the characters of Lajja met me in Kolkata in real life, the role of 'besharam' was made
 aisa kam hi hota he ki kisi lekhak kii mulaakaat uske paatro se ho jaae
 Wrote about women's rights, human rights, hindu-muslim unity in 'besharam'
 yah mere pathakon ke upar he ki ve isamen se kya grahan karte hai
 There is femininity through Zulekha, so also Suranjan's Hindutva
 meraa makasad yah bataanaa he ki achchhai-buraai sabhi main he
 It is not the case that there is only one hindu-muslim and one-man man
 sabamein sab kuch hota he
 6
 agar ham aapse puuchhen ki aapke nirvaasan ne kis tasalima ko taiyaar kiya? to aap kya kahengi?nirvaasan kise acha lagata he
 At first i thought i might return one day
 par yah aashaa khatm ho gayi
 My childhood partner, my editor, my relatives, my own
 
 
 unke sukhdukh main bhi unase na milane kaa malaal to hota hi he
 But i have done so much work even in this period, without any involvement with any political party and organization, i have no regrets about my past
 yah sochane kii baat he ki 1971 main jis dharmanirpeksh desh main main paidaa hui, vahi itnaa kattarpanthi ban gaya ki main apni maa, apane baba apane dada kisi kii mrityu par vahaan nahin ja saki
 
 
 (A silence with long breath) Yet i do not repent, because i fought in favor of women's freedom, humanity
 mujhe santosh he ki main satya ke saath hum
 Due to which a fatwa was also issued against me
 meri hatya kaa prayaas bhi hua
 
 
 Despite this i cannot say that i do not feel lonely! i am also a human, i also feel a problem
 7
 Bangladesh, many countries in Europe, then India
 
 
 yahaan bhi pashchim bengal or dilli? kis jagah kii mitti, log or samskruti aapako pasand ai?har jagah bahut saare achche log bhi hote hai or bure log bhi hai
 Are in every country
 main hameshaa se apane desh janaa chaahati hum
 i want to meet my publishers, friends
 chunki main vahaan nahin ja sakati isliye pashchim bengal aayi
 It was like a second home for me because of the language, dialect and living conditions
 yahaan main europe se ai thi
 Except for all the opportunities there
 bengali, bangala samskruti se mujhe prem tha
 But here too in 2007 my book was banned
 yahaan se meraa doosraa nirvaasan hua
 This is a very sad situation for me
 8
 From 'lajja' to 'besharam', what has changed in Bangladesh and India, in Indian society and politics? Who can be denied the change, but the regret is that in this change and development the status of 'woman' in that level But it has not changed, as it should
 stri ne jitani tarakkee kii, utana hi uskaa shoshan bhi hua
 The patriarchal society in Bangladesh has not yet changed
 vikaas kii tamaam gati ke baavjood striyon ko dabaane kii koshish lagaataar jari he
 Then there are many problems in our social system
 hamaari vaivaahik vyavastha main purushon ke apane rishte kaayam rahete hai
 Even childbirth does not work on its own accord
 agar aaj use naukari kii chhot he, to iske peeche bhi parivaar kii, pati kii aarthik madad ho sake yah soch shaamil he
 Women still play the traditional role
 vah apane parivaar ko paise nahin de sakati
 If you want to give equal status to women in the true sense, then you have to end the 'patriarchal' society
 stri balaatkaar kaa shikaar keval isliye hoti he ki ladakon ke dimag main yah bhar diya jaataa he ki 'ladki' tumhaare istemaal kii vastu he
 You tell me, how can a man who comes to prostitution look at any woman with a good eye? Every woman is a 'sex object' for him! Woman does not have authority over her body only
 vivaah jaisi sanstha main bhi vah balaatkaar- vaivaahik balaatkaar kaa shikaar hoti rahati he
 That is why i tell every girl, she should be bad for her rights, for her honor
 vah jitna hi buree banegi, vyavastha kaa virodh karegi, apane ko paaegi
 You will get your respect and equality
 9
 Which project are you working on these days? i am writing columns in some newspapers
 kavita likhnaa kam ho gaya he
 Working on the eighth part of a novel and autobiography
 10
 The church was attacked in Sri Lanka
 puri duniya main kattarta bad rahi he
 What solution do you see as a writer? Education is the only means to end bigotry
 jab tak dharm par jor diya jaataa rahegaa, yah sthiti badalegi nahin
 The interference of the state should end with religion
 rajya ise kisi bhi rup main badhaava na de
 Religion should always be the subject of one's personal faith
 vaigyanik soch ko badhaava diya jaae
 The special thing is that this work will have to be done jointly
 chaahe hindu ho, muslim ho, sikh yaa isai
 Everyone has to understand that 'terrorism' is coming only from religion, religious bigotry
 'het trade' par roak lagaani hogi
 Unfortunately, religion is not tolerant to people
 yahaan yah bhi dhyaan dena hoga ki ye halaat keval academik shiksha se nahin badalenge
 Education of equality, unity, compassion, compassion should be given to everyone
 meraa aashay 'sushiksha' se he
 It is about education of humanity and humanism

 mamata ne soshal netwarking site fasebuk par likhaa, ‘maine un lakhon logon ko aawaaj di he, jo chaahate hai ki raashtrapati kaisaa ho
 Refusing to soften his stand, he said, 'my party is a small party

 He said, 'your voice should be heard

 Describing the missile man as India's unique son, the Chief Minister of West Bengal said that Kalam should always be above petty politics

 ’ Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has taken a unique class of his mlas and their families
 darasal, is 'naitik class' kii jarurat isliye padi, kyonki 6 lakh ke rishwat cond main unke mantri aasim ahamed khan barkhaast kiye gaye
 After the dismissal of Asim Ahmed Khan, Aam Aadmi Party mlas and ministers were called by Kejriwal to the meeting along with the family
 mantriyon or vidhayakon par badhate aaropon ke chhinte or daagdar daaman ke bich kejariwal sarkaar ke saamne saakh kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya
 In such a situation, Kejriwal was discussing with legislators and ministers
 lekin kejariwal ne parivaaravaalon ko bhi baithak main bulaayaa, to saaf ho gaya ki kahin na kahin kejariwal AAP kii chhavi sudhaar muhim main party netaaon ke bivi-bacchon kii bhagidaari bhi tay kar rahe hai
 When Kejriwal got involved in discussions with the family of his mlas and ministers, the line of big luxury vehicles outside gave an indication of how the politics of becoming a VIP in the name of the common man
 AAP ke vidhayak jis tarah kii gadiyon main aae, usne ek sawaal to khadaa kar hi diya ki kya ye vastav main aam aadmi hai, kyonki audi or farchuner jaisi gaadiyaan aam aadmi ke paas amuman nahin hotin
 Then Kejriwal himself has been against VIP culture
 AAP ke vidhayak ve log hai, jo shapath grahan samaaroh main metro se gaye
 But today, among those leaders, some descended from Audi, some from Fortuner, some from BMW and Innova
 yani rangath khaas thi

 Sanjay Dutt's performance is such that the public has been sitting on his head and eyes for three decades
 lekin unhone kiya ek aisa gunaah ki saadhe teen saal tak jindagi jail main gujaregi
 The countdown to prison life has begun
 sawaal he ki kaise kategi sanjay dutt kii jail?bollywood ke sabase mahange abhinaytaon main se ek sanjay dutt kii jindagi mumbai ke arthor road jail main ek aam kaidi kii tarah hi guzar rahi he
 Waking up at fixed time in the morning, having a jail meal and staying in your cell lekin in sabake bich sanjay dutt subah-subah hanuman chalisa kaa paath karnaa nahin bhoolatey
 Watch the video: How 'munnabhai' misguided on the road of life happened in a few moments, but the punishment will pass from year to year
 dil ko jeet lene vaale nayak kaa kirdaar ho yaa ruh kampa dene vaale khalanaayak kaa yaa udaasi main ghota lagaate chehron par hansi bikher dene vaale kamedian kii, har bhoomika ko apane alag andaaj main nibhaane vaale sanjay dutt ke liye jindagi ne ek nai bhoomika taiyaar kar di- kaidi kii
 Sanjay Dutt, who was convicted for illegally possessing weapons during the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, is lodged in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail
 makhmali sej par sone vaale superstar ke liye jail kii jameen hi ab bistar he or prashansakon kii bheed kii jagah le lee he jail kii tanhai ne
 Watch the video: Sanjay Dutt was brought to Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail on the evening of suspense after Sanjay Dutt was taken to Yerawada Jail
 is jail ke ek special cell main sanjay dutt ko rakhaa gaya he
 No matter how big a person Sanjay Dutt is in the outside world, he has to live like a common prisoner inside the jail
 yahaan ghadi kii tik-tik ke saath aage badhati he munnabhai kii zindagi
 Friday morning was the first morning of jail for Sanjay Dutt
 sanjay dutt saadhe 6 baje duusare kaidiyon kii tarah hi sokar jag gaye
 Shortly thereafter, he received his morning tea
 sanjay dutt ko naashte main poha diya gaya
 But after that, they continued to eat biscuits from the canteen
 vaise to dopaher main unke liye ghar se khaanaa gaya tha, lekin sanjay dutt ne ghar kaa khaanaa lautaa diya
 Eat lentils and chapattis according to the jail menu
 shaam ko naashte main sanjay dutt ne kele khaae
 The special thing is that the food of the jail which does not descend under the circle of good, Sanju Baba found it very tasty
 yahi vajah he ki raat main bhi sanjay dutt ne jail kaa hi khaanaa khaaya
 The last time Sanjay Dutt did the work of making chairs in the jail
 lekin is baar unke kareebi maane jane vaale mahesh bhatta ke mutabik, sanjay dutt kaidiyon ko drama sikhayenge or haa, vakt mila, to apni jindagi ke falsafe kii hakeekat kitaab kii shakl main duniya ke saamne laaenge
 No matter how many times in a three-hour film, Sanjay Dutt, who changed clothes, has to wear the same traditional clothes of prisoners behind the bars of the prison, white pants and shirt
 sanjay dutt jaanate he ki jail kii tanhai kaise kaatane ko daudti he, isliye khabar he ki apane saath wo ramayana, hanuman chalisa or gita bhi lekar gaye hai
 Sanjay Dutt recites Hanuman Chalisa at 8 am every day and also turns the rosary of Rudraksha
 jail main bhi ye routine kaayam he
 In the gloomy evenings of the prison and the dark nights of loneliness, what does Ramayana, Hanuman Chalisa and Geeta give you the courage to face? film abhinayta sanjay dutt ko pichley guuruuvaar ko arthor road jail main bheja gaya
 But Sanjay Dutt wants him to be sent to Yerwada Jail in Pune, where he had already served some of his sentence
 sanjay dutt or unase milane pahunchi bahan priya dutt ne jail adhikariyon se guhaar bhi lagaai, lekin somvaar se pehle yaravada jail dur hi dikhti he
 Americans who use Swiss banks for legitimate purposes also now fill an affidavit on the basis of which information is shared with the US Tax Administration
 duniya ke dhankuberon kii ranking karne vaali ek pratishthit patrika ke mutabik aisa isliye hua he kyonki america sarkaar ne behad aakraamak dhang se swiss bainkon se america logon ke kaale dhan kii jaankariyaan nikaal lee hai or bainkon ko sakht sharton se baandh diya he jiske baad america ke liye swiss bainkon kii mithkeey gopneeyata kaa khaatmaa ho gaya he
 This is the way to draw the curtains of black money animals
 bharat ke log jab apni nai sarkaar se isi tarah ke dam-kham kii apeksha kar rahe the tab sarkaar supreme court main kaale dhan ke videshi khaaton kaa khulaasa karne se mukarte hue gopneeyata ke us khol main ghus gai, jisase use global str par jujhna he
 Hiding information is the international strength of the black money business, to break it, a new mechanism of exchange of tax information between developed countries is ready
 bharat ko gopneeyata ke aagrah chhodkar is kaa hissaa banane kii muhim shuru kerani thi, taaki kaale dhan ke videshi khaaton tak pahunchaa ja sake
 The official affidavit of the expose of information from Germany on foreign accounts of black money is legal but not daring at all
 kaledhan vaale kuch khatedaaron ke naam saamne laae ja sakate the kyonki may 2012 main sansad main pesh shwet patr ke mutabik germany se mili soochnaaon main 17 maamalon par abhiyojan shuru ho gaya he or vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon kii maani jaae to abhiyojan shuru hone ke baad kar sandhi kii gopneeyata aade nahin aati
 The terms of the tax treaty with Germany have been taken to hide the names of black money holders
 vaise sach yah bhi he ki kar sandhiyon ke bandhan sakht hai
 In order to get information in this system, developing countries give huge tax concessions to developed countries
 kar sandhiyon kii vyavastha bharat jaise deshon ko suchanaaen chhipaane main madad bhi karti hai, jaisaa ki is samay ho rahaa he
 Tax treaties have not proved effective in curbing the flow of black money, so developed countries have created an automatic mechanism for sharing tax information
 bharat ko is tantra main shaamil hona he
 But the courage needed for this did not appear in the case of black money
 dilli main pichley maah tab kaale dhan ke videshi khaaton par paradedaari kaa halafanama ban rahaa hoga, jab kange (australia) main viksit deshon ke vitt mantri tex soochnaaon ke aadan-pradaan ke dhaanche ko antim rup de rahe the, jise kanoon ke jariye lagu kiya jayega
 This information system, which will be active from 2018, will be announced at Brisbane's G20 Summit next month, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be there
 vibhinn deshon ke bich soochnaaon kaa nirbaadh aadan-pradaan us gopneeyata ko khatm karata he jiske boote kaala dhan chhipaane vaale tex haiven kaam karte hai
 This system of developed countries is a system of automatic exchange of information
 maujuuda vyavastha ke tahat deshon ko ek-duusare se jaankariyaan maangani padati hai, jisamen bhrasht adhikari suchanaaen chipa lete hai
 According to the Tax Justice Network, this mechanism is the most effective system to crack down on black money hoarders
 bharat ko in soochnaaon kii sabase zyada jarurat he jo bhrashtachar kaa bada shikaar he or jisaki lut un tex haiven main jamaa he, jahaan se viksit mulk apana kaala dhan nikaal rahe hai
 Switzerland's oldest Veglin bank closed last year after the US tightening on black money
 america logon kaa kaala dhan chhipaane par ubies ko baari jurmaana dena padaa he
 In 2011, Britain also started charging a hefty tax on black money from British banks from Swiss banks
 bharat ke log yadi apni nai sarkaar se aisi hi apeksha karte hai to galat nahin he, kyonki yah sarkaar videsh main jamaa kaale dhan ko waapas laane ke vaade par satta main ai he
 It is a different matter that the way of accessing foreign accounts goes through transparency, which has not yet been seen to be built
 bharat main sach chhipaana sarkari niyam kaa hissaa he jo na keval kaali kamai ke liye mufeed he balki paardarshita kii koshishon main shaamil hone main baadha bhi banataa he
 Where intelligence agencies do not share information among themselves and the information of defaulters is not shared between banks, it is worth noting information from tax havens
 oisidi centre of tex policy ke nideshak pascal saint emens ne is saal may main kaha tha ki vikasshil deshon kii kar pranali itani aadhunik nahin he ki use soochnaaon ke automatic vinimay kaa hissaa banaaya ja sake
 If Brisbane will pressurize India to join the information system in the G20 meeting, then his own leadership will take these efforts
 kaale dhan ko chhipaane kaa global tantra gopneeyata ke jabardast pratispardhi agrahon par aadhaarit he jise bhedane ke liye apane niyamon ko paardarshee bananaa pehali shart he, kyonki muqabla tex haiven se he jahaan sach chhipaane kaa kaarobaar kanoon ke tahat hota he
 The new government was expected to show the courage to change the law and transparency, but the affidavit in the Supreme Court has deepened the secrecy of black money
 kaali kamai ke khilaaf muhim kii yah badi dabbu shuruyaat he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reached Madhupur village in Pratapgarh on Monday

 pratapgarh ke sabase bade gaanv madhupur main rashan card or alag-alag pension ke bare main mukhyamantri ne poocha to janata se vahi jawaab aayaa ki 'nahin mila he'
 Once again, the Chief Minister heard a lot of officers from the stage and publicly warned them that no kind of cruelty will be tolerated
 janata ko bhi nasihandhikariyon ko khari-khoti sunaane ke baad mukhyamantri ne janata ko bhi halki fatkaar lagaai
 He instructed the public to understand the schemes fully to oppose them and said that the government should understand the schemes and choose for them
 isse pehle manch par aate hi mukhyamantri ne labhaarthiyon ko pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat makaan kii chaabi di
 He also gave gifts to pregnant women under the baby shower ceremony and started the Annaprashan Yojana with his own hands

 He said, 'I meet the public every day, listen to their problems, but now put a chaupal
 unhone kaha ki is kaarykram main aana jaruri tha kyonki pradhanmantri ne 20 hajaar se zyada gaanv kaa chayan isliye kiya he kyonki anusuchit jatiyon kii aadhi se zyada aabaadi inhen gaanv main rahati he
 On Dalits having food here, he said that this is not an election system

 rahul gandhi ke khilaaf bina anumati vaale raste par road sho karne ke khilaaf chunaav aachaar samhita ulanghan kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The case was registered under sections 88, 283, 290

 He said that due to the festival of Mahashivaratri on Monday, Shiva Yatra is taken out from many places in the city, so violating the time limit is a violation of the code of conduct
 hariom ne kaha ki road sho main puri tarah se aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya gaya or subah saadhe das baje se shuru hua road sho shaam kareeb saadhe teen baje samaapt hua or isamen nirdhaarit maarg se adhik seemaa tay kii gai isaliye road sho ke aayojakon ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ulanghan kaa maamla darj kiya jayega
 On the other hand, Congress state president Rita Bahuguna Joshi says that there has been no violation of the code of conduct and the party has informed the Election Commission about this attitude of the district administration

 The gold monetization scheme has been around 15 days since the scheme was launched but the public has not shown interest in it
 ab tak is skim ke tahat sirf 400 gram sona hi jamaa ho paaya he
 The need for more purity centers now According to a leading source in the industry, the lack of centers to check gold is one of the main reasons for this mismatch, for which the Ministry of Finance has been consulted
 iske alaava bainkon main kagaji karrwai kaa zyada jhanjhat bhi skim ko acha rispons na milane kii ek vajah ke rup main saamne aa rahi he
 The objective of this scheme of the Central Government was to bring 20 thousand tonnes of gold worth more than Rs
 52 lakh crores to the market without any use in the country
 badhenge purity centressutron ke mutabik, vitt mantralay se is gold skim main raftaar laane ke liye apil kii gai he ki ve biies act se panjikrut jewelers ko sone ko jamaa karne kii anumati den
 a ministry head has said that 55 gold purity centers will be opened by December, which is currently just 29
 iske saath hi gold rifinary kii sankhya bhi 4 se badhaakar 20 kar di jaaegi
 If this scheme is implemented in its entirety, then it will prove to be a profitable deal for the government, business and common man, all three
 jaaniye kaise -aam aadmi ke paas teen vikalp1) vah sone ke sikke kharid kar gahanon par lagane vaale 10-15% tak ke mekking charge se batch saktaa he
 2) He can deposit his gold in the bank and withdraw it after the limited period
 3) vah minimum 1 gram se 500 gram sona kharid kar sovarin bond main nivesh kar saktaa he
 5 Big Benefits of Gold Scheme 1) Under this scheme, the government can deposit gold in the bank and use it for financial investment
 iske chalate sone ke aayaat ko bhi ghataya ja sakegaa
 2) This scheme is also better because it provides a better option than gold without any interest in the locker
 isamen aap nahin, balki bank aapako byaaj degaa
 3) Income from this will also not come under the income tax and capital gains tax
 4) vyapaariyon ko gharelu bazaar main hi sona uplabdh ho jayega jisase unhen emport duty ke boj se chhutkaaraa milegaa
 5) This scheme will stop the theft happening in the gold jewelry making industry on a large scale
 sarkaar hollmark vaali julri legi jiske liye certification chahie hoga
 In this way, items of purity will come in the market and gold will be less adulterated
 isse aane vaale samay main vaishvik str par behatar pakad banegi
 Why is this scheme for you? Under this scheme you can deposit your gold in the bank, instead of which the bank will give you a fixed rate of interest
 yah phaayde kaa sauda isliye he kyonki jab aap loker lekar sona rakhte hai to aapako bank ko paise chukaane padate hai lekin isamen ulte bank hi aapako paise degaa
 According to the guidelines issued by the RBI, as per the guidelines issued by the RBI, at least 30 grams of 995 purity gold will have to be kept in the bank while there is no maximum limit
 isamen gold-baar, sikke, gahane aadi shaamil honge
 Keep in mind that this will not include metal
 jamaa karne se pehle shuddhta kii hogi jaanchis skim main teen tareeke kii samyavadhi main sona jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 Short term (1 to 3 years), medium term (5 to 7 years) and long term (12 to 15 years)
 iske alaava sone ko jamaa karne se pehle uski shuddhta kii jaanch hogi
 Only then can the work related to submission be carried forward
 sona waapas len yaa paisa, donon vikalp maujuudamacurity period samaapt hone par aap ke yah opshan hoga ki aap yaa to paise len yaa phir apana sona waapas len
 The good thing is that you will be paid according to the price of gold at that time
 jab aap sona jamaa karne jaaenge tab hi aap se puch liya jayega ki aap koun sa vikalp chunane ja rahe hai
 Keep in mind that you cannot change this later

 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main unke ubharne kii sambhaavna ke bare main puche jane par modi ne kaha ki vah gujarat ko nai bulandiyon tak le janaa chaahate hai or is uddeshy ko puraa karne ke liye vah kaam karte rahenge

 Asked about the possibility of his emergence as a prime ministerial candidate, Modi said that he wants to take Gujarat to new heights and will continue to work to fulfill this objective

 The Delhi government has decided to bring BS-6 petrol and diesel in Delhi from next year to tackle deadly pollution
 khabar aate hi yah sawaal sabake man main he ki sirf petrol-dijal badalane se pradooshan kis had tak rukegaa
 This question arises because the government is bringing Bharat Stage 6 petrol and diesel from Delhi next year, but the time limit for bringing BS-6 vehicles has not been changed, which is 2020
 pehle bharat stage 6 kii gaadiyaan or petrol-dijal donon ko laane kii samay seemaa 2020 hi thi
 But when there was an outcry over the deadly pollution of Delhi, the government decided that it will be sold in Delhi from April 2018 and only BS-6 petrol and diesel in the entire NCR from 2019
 petroleum ke export narendra taneja kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke is faisle se dilli kaa pradooshan kam karne main kaaphi madad milegi or logon ko raahat mahasoos hogi
 He says that BS-6 diesel contains 70 to 75 per cent less polluting hazardous substances than BS-4
 narendra taneja kaa kahana he ki gaadiyaan BS-6 nahin hone kii vajah se tatkaal iskaa puraa phayda to nahin milegaa lekin iske baavjood pradooshan main kami hogi
 This will bring great relief to the pollution caused by diesel vehicles especially because BS-6 level diesel will be much better in terms of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide and particulate matter
 ye wo khatarnakpradooshan failaane vaale padaarthhain jinke sharir main jane se cancer, asthma se lekar fefdon tak kii tamaam tarah kii bimaariyaan hoti hai
 The special thing is that all the private and some state oil companies of India are already producing BS-6 petrol and diesel but due to no regulations in the country it was being exported to other developed countries but Was not being sold in India
 lekin bade str par puure dilli or ensiaar main BS-6 petrol dijal supplai karne ke liye yaa to sarkaar ko sarkari tel companiyon se fouran apni technology behatar karne ko kahana hoga yaa phir privet tel companiyon se tel khareednaa hoga
 Narendra Taneja says that production of BS-6 petrol and diesel is expensive and to implement it all over the country, oil companies will have to modernize their refinery by spending between 50 thousand to 70 thousand crores
 ek chunauti yah hogi ki sirf dilli main agle saal se BS-6 petrol-dijal to milane lagegaa lekin ensiaar main yah faisla 2019 se lagu hoga
 This means that vehicles carrying BS-4 petrol and diesel from places like Noida, Gurugram, Sonipat, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida will continue to come to Delhi fearlessly and spread pollution
 dijal kii gaadiyaan pradooshan kaa sabase bada kaaran he or unase nikalne vaale jahrile padaarth sehat ke liye sabase khatarnaak hai
 That is why until this decision is not implemented in the entire NCR at least then its effect will be seen, but to see a big difference, we will have to wait a little longer when from 2019 BS-6 diesel and petrol will be available in the entire NCR

 zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen Various types of tablet computers have been raging in the market for some time
 ye tablet choti screen vaale netbuk computaron ke baad madhyam shrenee ke laptop kii bazaar hissedari par bhi apana kabja jamaa rahe hai
 In such a situation, computer makers are changing their notebooks or laptops in such a way that the consumer interest in their products also remains
 laptop ko log pasand karte rahen, iske liye unki surat or farformens ko kaaphi badla ja rahaa he
 Fascinating, thin and superfast ultrabooks are now being launched in the country and world markets
 darasal, ultrabuk koi technology nahin he, yah intel kaa trademark he jisane laptop kii is nai kism ke liye kuch apane niyam banaae hai
 Intel says that Ultrabooks should be extremely thin, start in a very short time, with more battery life and security
 sabase badi baat yah he ki in divices kii keemat 1,000 dollar ke aasapaas honi chahie
 Since Ultrabook is a trademark, it should have Intel's new CULV processor and second generation Intel i-core processor with very low power consumption
 inamen integrated graphics, solid-state dryves, unibody dizin ke saath hi lambey samay tak saath dene vaali bydaree honi chahie
 According to Intel, Ultrabooks should have a larger screen (at least 13 inches) than their netbooks and their processing power and storage capacity should also be better
 lekin netbuks kii tarah ultrabux main bhi koi optical yaa slot drivj ke saath hi kai regular ports nahin honge
 Ultrabooks like netbooks are not cheap, but must be better in terms of features and speed
 intel ke dakshin asia ke diarector, marketing, sandip arora kaa kahana he, 'ye smart or aakarshak, behad patali divices zyada se zyada tej pradarshan karengi, security fitures honge or inamen yujar kii jarurat ke mutabik rispance dene kii jabardast kshamta hogi
 'being very slim, light and beautiful, they will be happily accepted as lifestyle accessories
 lambii bydaree life or bahut mahangi nahin hone ke kaaran intel ko ummid he ki ultrabuk divises kii vajah se mobile computing ke kshetra main khaasi halchal hogi
 Aurora hopes that Ultrabooks can make the same change as Intel Centrino Technology did to mobile computing technology eight years ago
 lekin iske baavjood netbuk ko khaarij karnaa jaldbaaji hogi
 Especially at a time when the price of an ultrabook is more than double that of a netbook even today
 lekin kai companiyon ne aane vaale samay main ultrabux par hi dhyaan kendrit karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Ultrabooks may not eliminate netbooks, but tablet computers are definitely doing this
 ultrabuk madhyam or mahange laptop kaa vikalp ho sakati hai or inkaa bhi tablet ke saath kisi na kisi rup main muqabla jarur hoga
 These attractive devices of the second generation will have the ability to take command with your gestures and gestures and will also show features like touchscreen
 ultrabuk main tach se judi aplications ke bare main ek shodh ke hawaale se intel kaa kahana he ki laptop jaise do jude hisson vaali dizin main yugers ko screen par tach ke saath hi keyboard ke istemaal main koi kathinaayee nahin hoti
 That is, they will be able to use Ultrabook Touch divided into two parts very easily
 arora kehete hai, 'aane vaale samay main tach ke istemaal ke baad ultrabuk kii dizin or aakaar main zyada se zyada nae-nae prayog honge
 Hybrid and convertible will come with the design of a two-part laptop
 saath hi aise bhi dizin jarur aaenge jinaki ab tak kalpana nahin kii gai he
 'four companies have introduced Ultrabooks in India
 esar apni es3 ultrabuk ke saath bhartiya bazaar main aane vaali pehali company he
 After this Lenovo has introduced U300S and HP has introduced Folio 13
 esas ne kuch hi samay baad xenbook pesh kii thi
 The S3 is priced around Rs 48,000
 or xenbook kii 89,999 ru
 Has kuch or model ke saal ke madhya main bharat main aane kii ummid he, or kaha ja rahaa he ki ye hi asal game changer honge
 The LG x-note's Z330 / 430 is being called Super Ultrabooks
 1
 The Jade 330 weighing 2 kg is 100 grams lighter than others
 isaki motaai 1
 Is 47 cm
 samsung siries5, esar aspire es5, echpi envi14 spectre, samsung siries9 or del ekspies13 bhi aane vaale hai
 But some people say that you cannot consider Ultrabooks as a separate category because no manufacturer is fully following Intel's standards
 visheshgyon ne is baat ko bhi ahmiyat di he ki bazaar main aa chukin ultrabux kii bydaree life intel maanak ke hisaab se sabase nichle str par he, jabaki dusron main 10 ghante tak bydaree life dekhi ja sakati he
 Most Ultrabooks also cost more than $ 1,000
 lekin phir bhi is baat ke asaar kaaphi hai ki jab aap bazaar main laptop kharidne jaaenge to ultrabuk kharidkar lautenge
 In the coming months, you will be able to hear a lot about Ultrabooks in the coming few months as many computer makers are focusing on this new type of category
 philhal aapke paas chunane ke liye kam hi model hai, lekin ham puure bharose ke saath kah sakate hai ki agle june maheene se computing kii duniya badalane vaali he
 As far as technology is concerned, ultrabooks will start appearing in larger sizes beyond the 13 inch limit
 chunki chote aakaar kii vajah se kai graahak isse dur hai, intel ke saath hi computer utpaadak 14 inch or 15 inch ke vikalp bazaar main laaenge
 At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas recently, Intel showed some prototypes showing 'touch' capability
 aane vaale samay main aap kai ultrabux main tach kii khubi bhi dekh sakenge
 As soon as Windows 8 arrives in the market, you will see that in mobile computing devices, touch will be a necessity rather than luxury
 ultrabux kii keemton ko bhi kam karne kii koshish kii jaaegi taaki saal ke aakhir tak is nai shrenee kii bazaar hissedari ko 40 fisadi tak badhaayaa ja sake
 The evolving form of Ultrabook appeared as Lenovo Yoga at CES
 yah ultrabuk un logon ke saare bhram ko dur kar degi jo laptop or tablet main se ek ko nahin chun pate hai
 Yoga has the ability to take the form of a tablet
 iskaa kii-board peeche kii ore fold ho saktaa he
 After coming to Windows 8, this Ultrabook can come in the market
 ultrabuk kaise alag he laptop se1
 Processor laptops are still looking for a standard processor while Ultrabooks will have second generation I5 and I7 processors
 2
 Size laptops are not fixed, while most ultrabooks will be 13 inches, not larger
 inaki motaai aam laptaap se aadhi hogi
 Therefore ultrabooks will be lighter
 3
 Ports Many of the ports you see on common laptops will not appear in Ultrabooks
 ultrabuk main 2 yuasabi or echdiemai port honge, vijie or ethernet port nahin
 4
 dizin badi badariyon ko rakhane ke liye ultrabux kii unibody dizin hoti he, lekin kuch hi laptop aisi body ko apana sake hai
 5
 bydaree ultrabux kii bydaree life zyada he

 Sitharaman said that this two-pronged approach can increase consumption by spending on public infrastructure or by paying money in the hands of the people
 yah bhi sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he ki sankat jo kuch kshetron tak simit he, usase nipta ja sake
 The Finance Minister said that this process should go on continuously until the economy truly shows tangible progress

 But this time the Samajwadi Party (SP), which has always been hurt after the work is done, is sitting in the state power with a historic majority and is in a position to convert its strength into better bargaining
 isliye vakt kii najaakat ko bhaanp congress bhi sapa ko najadik laane kaa mauka nahin ganvaana chaahati
 On the first day of the budget session of Parliament, Congress President Sonia Gandhi's initiative to go ahead and congratulate Mulayam or to express regret by writing a letter immediately after Akhilesh Yadav did not go to the oath taking ceremony, efforts are being made by the party to bring Mulayam along
 
 apane sahyogi dalon main trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee ke badalte tevar hon yaa dramuk kii naaraazgi yaa phir sharad pavaar ke siyaasi pench, congress ke liye mulaayam jarurat ban rahe hai
 After Mamata Banerjee's sharp remarks on the increased fares in the railway budget, the Congress has to not only keep the equation of numbers in the budget session, but it is a tough challenge to keep the numbers of its government in the future
 iske liye sonia gandhi samet congress ke tamaam ranneetikaar har morche par sakriy hai
 The Congress has also put forward RJD supremo Lalu Yadav for Mulayam's plea and that is why Lalu has rejected the Third Front's fragrance
 lekin katu anubhav or tisare morche kii aguai karne kii dili khwaahish main mulaayam apane pattey nahin khol rahe
 After handing over the reins of Uttar Pradesh to his son Akhilesh, it is time for him to try his hand in the politics of the Center and recover the full support price
 chaalu vittiya varsh main uttar pradesh par 2,05,000 karod ru
 Has a debt of more than
 yani rajya kaa har naagarik 29,500 ru
 Is a borrower and only 60 per cent of the state's total income ends up in salary payments, pension and loan interest payments
 rajya vitt vibhaag ke mutabik, karj adaayagi kii sthiti main nahin hone kii vajah se pradesh par boj badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Young Chief Minister Akhilesh has a long list of promises made to the public
 berogari bhatta se lekar kisaanon kii karj maafee ke liye sarkaar ko badi rakam chahie
 The most important thing is that the Congress is in crisis at the same time when the SP also needs central assistance
 nishchit taur par is rajnatik maahaul main mulaayam behad satark hai or mauka na chookte hue ve pradesh ke liye sinchai package, bundelkhand ke liye vishesh sahaayta or bijli ke liye pariyojnaayen lene kii koshish karenge
 He knows that the more the tensions between the Congress government and Mamata, the more their importance in central politics will increase
 lekin pradesh kii khastahal aarthik sthiti ko patari par laane ke liye centre kii ore takate mulaayam congress se dooriyaan bhi nahin bana sakate
 The stubborn stance of the SP can also take the Congress closer to the BSP
 chaudaavin loksabhaa main 39 saansad jitakar laane vaali sapa ko congress ne tavajjo nahin di thi
 mulayam-amar Singh, who accompanied the then CPI (M) General Secretary Harkishan Singh Surjeet to the upa-left Front's first dinner party at 10 Janpath, had to return impassively
 lekin jab parmaanu qaraar ke mudde par vam morche ne samarthan waapas khinch liya, to vam ke saath apni dosti ko kinare kar mulaayam ne congress ko na sirf sahaara diya, balki safaltaapurvak naiya paar lagaai thi
 However, a senior SP leader says in Dabi Juban, "mulayam has always helped the UPA government in the last eight years, now it is the Congress's turn to settle the accounts
" mukhyamantri namit hone ke baad sansad pahunche akhilesh kaa yah elaan ki congress sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa karegi or sapa kaa samarthan jari rahegaa, party kii ranneeti kaa yah ahm hissaa he
 It is clear that in the current scenario both the congress-sp are feeling the need of each other
 lekin uttar pradesh ke nateezon se mulaayam ke pradhanmantri banane ke mansoobey ko pankh lag gaye hai, isliye sapa khud ko sarkaar kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahati kyonki aisa karne se tisare morche kii pahal ko vakt se pehle hi palitha lag saktaa he

 "the wife of an education worker gave her life because her husband had received a notice of dismissal," says Sanjay Sharma, the governing member of the state education workers association
 hadtaal main shaamil paanch shikshakon kii to maut ho gai
 If the agitators are to be believed, the government wants to avoid them by saying that they have died due to illness
 idhar, schuli shiksha mantri brijmohan agarwal ab bhi apni sarkaar kaa bachaav karte hue kehete hai, ''sarkaar ne pehle bhi shikshakarmiyon ke hit main kai nirnay kiye hai
 It is wrong to consider him insensitive

 Thousands of education workers of the state have been sitting on an indefinite strike in Raipur, demanding the same salary as regular teachers and their merger with the government from the panchayat
 isse 40,000 se zyada skulon main padhai thap ho gai he
 The condition of primary and middle schools is worse because there are more than 80 percent of the education staff there

 Teacher Pritam Sahu, sitting at the dharna site, says, "now you cannot do any other work
 '' shikshakarmiyon kaa samaan pad-samaan vetan andolan lambey samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 They strike twice every year and the government increases the salary slightly
 isi ke chalate 2001 main shikshakarmi varg-3 kaa vetan 2,250 ru

 This time there is a special reason for the excess in the movement

 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa-patr main kaha tha ki sarkaar banate hi shikshakarmiyon kii maangen puri kar di jaaengi lekin ab nilamban or barkhaastagi kii karrwai kar unamem dar paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 "former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, who reached out to support the education workers, first assured the merger of the Congress as soon as the government came
 yah baat or he ki khud unke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhi shikshakarmiyon ko laathiyaan hi mili thim
 Education workers are definitely demanding a merger, but if a top IAS officer who is a secretary in the Panchayat Department, it is not easy
 unke mutabik shikshakarmiyon kii niyokta panchayat he or niyokta ko badla nahin ja saktaa
 As it is, the cadre of regular teachers has been abolished in the state, in which case the merger will be done
 niyamit shikshak ritair hote ja rahe hai or unki jagah par shikshakarmiyon kii hi niyukti ho rahi he
 "there is discrepancy in salary but their demand is not justified because the cadre of government teachers has been exhausted," says a senior Congress leader Dabi Juban, who is publicly supporting education workers
 '' magar shikshakarmi nirnaayak mood main hai isiilie ab tak paanch shikshakarmiyon kii maut ho jane ke baavjood andolan badastoor jari he
 Sanjay Sharma says, "unless all the demands are met, the movement will not end
" yah aakhri or nirnaayak ladaai hogi
 "but the government also does not seem to be softening
 panchayat mantri hemchand yadav kehete hai, ''chhattisgarh sarkaar shikshakarmiyon ko anya rajyon se adhik vetan de rahi he
 However, the government has set up a cabinet subcommittee to interact with the academics
 is samiti main schuli shiksha mantri brijmohan agarwal, panchayat mantri hemchand yadav, ucch shiksha mantri ramavichaar netaam or adivasee mantri kedaar kashyap shaamil hai
 But the agitating teachers are not satisfied with it and call it full of food
 shikshakarmiyon ke mudde ko lekar pichley 12 saal main alag-alag sarkaron ne 15 cametiyaan banaai thim lekin nateeja sifer rahaa
 See, what color does another committee bring? bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne ravivaar ko himachal main yojit ek raily main kaha ki is samay centre main sattashin congress sarkaar kaa ahankaar saatven aasmaan par he

 Modi, while attacking Congress, said that Congress is a dynastic party and it is the enemy of democracy
 modi ne kaha ki jo eemaandaaree se tex bharte hai, jinhone desh kii seva kii he, jo selary par kaam karte hai, lekin deshke liye kaam karte he unhen ham phayda denge
 By bringing black money from abroad, we will share it with these honest people
 desh main agar bhrashtachar kii janani koi he to vah sirf congress he
 If Congressmen have not committed corruption, then why do they not bring black money stashed abroad
 modi ne centre or himachal sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki aaj himachal ke kisaanon ko seb kii keemat nahimilti
 They ask for crops from abroad, but the farmers here do not get fair price
 unhone kaha kihimachal kaa betaa jaagta he to desh chaiyn se sota he
