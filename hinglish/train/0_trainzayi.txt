 'guuruuvaar kokelakatta hoicourtne murti visarjan or moharram juluus ko lekar mamata sarkaar ke aadesh ko radd kar diya
 The court expressed displeasure that such arbitrary orders could not be given
 isse pehle mamata banerjee ne dakshin kolkata ke pom avenue main ek puja pandal main apane bhaashan main virodhiyon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Mamta said that when i launch Durga Puja or Ganesh Utsav, there is no charge of appeasement but if i offer Eid prayers, then the opponents start making such allegations
 mamata ne kaha ki agar ye tushtikaran haito main jab tak jivit hum, aisa karti rahuungi
 Even if someone puts a gun on my forehead, i will do the same
 main kisi se bhedbhaav nahin karti
 This is the culture of Bengal, this is my culture

 The government does not have the right to continue: BJP leader Vijayvargiya said that if a government tells the judiciary that you fail to maintain law and order, then the government has no right to stay
 yah tushtikaran kii niti par jabardast tamaacha he
 Kailash Vijayvargiya says that Mamata was doing this only for the politics of vote
 halki raajnneeti kaa khel khel rahi thi, jisase unka cheharaa benakaab ho gaya he
 The strong leader said that the BJP leader said that Mamta Sarkar should say that Hindu brothers should celebrate their festival and Muslim brothers should celebrate their festival
 
 
 dekhati hum main khadi hoti hum
 Who messes up yah damdaar mukhyamantri or sarkaar kaa kaam hota he
 This is the defeat of appeasement politics

 Two apps - one whatsapp and the other Paytm
 donon ek-duusare ke aamane saamne hai
 Everything has changed in a few days and now these two apps are rivaling each other
 vajah sirf ek he
 The world's most used messaging app whatsapp has started whatsapp Payment in India
 isse pehle tak whatsap or petm kii koi takkar hi nahin thi, kyonki donon ek duusare se kaaphi alag eps the
 On one hand, the world's most used instant messaging app is whatsapp, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide
 duusari taraf bhartiya i-wolet petm ap he jo yahaan sabase zyada yuj kiya jaataa he
 Since demonetization, Paytm is at a new height and its users are increasing steadily
 whatsap pement system launch hote hi petm ke siio vijay shekhar sharma ne ek twit kiya jisase saaf dikh rahaa he ki whatsap ke aane se petm main kitni khalabali machi he
 Vijay Shekhar Sharma told PTI, 'we want to be treated equally
 whatsap pement main koi login passwordenhin hota do customers ke liye bada security risk he
 Since whatsapp payment is currently in beta testing, we do not think there will be any changes later
 'vijay shekhar sharma ne kaha ET se kaha he, 'fasebuk khule taur par hamaare pement system ko colonise kar rahaa he or UPI ko apane phaayde ke liye customij kar rahaa he
 UPI is made for India, now some American monopolistic companies are twisting UPI to bring it on their platform
 'in donon bayanon se ye saaf he ki kaise petm main whatsap pement kii dastak bhar se halchal machi he
 This can also be another reason for this stir, because whatsapp is getting full support from the government for this
 niti ayog ke siio amitabh kaant ne ek twit kiya jisamen unhone whatsap se pement screenshot share kiya or kaha ki whatsapp se pement karnaa kaaphi aasaan he
 Let's know what is the difference between whatsapp and Paytm when it comes to payment
 donon main hi UPI kaa saport diya gaya he
 whatsapp Payment In this app, the company has given a special payment option, which you can access by going to the settings of whatsapp
 doosraa opshan chat main atachaments par clic karke bhej sakate hai
 It is important to have a bank account linked to the mobile number and here too the UPI process is the same
 yahaan aapke number se aapaki veriphication hogi
 Here also you have to give UPI PIN
 ye sab process ke baad aap duusare contacts ko chat karte karke paise bhi bhej sakate hai, lekin jise paise bhej rahe hai uske paas bhi nae varjan kaa whatsap or bank acount se linkd mobile number hona chahie
 You do not need a password to login on whatsapp
 haalanki whatsap ke saath ek phayda ye he ki yah aapke number par hi chalata he or aapke alaava koi doosraa aapkaa whatsap kahin se acces nahin kar saktaa
 whatsapp only runs on one device at a time
 paytmyaham UPI ke jariye kisi ko paise bhejne ke liye chat windo khulti he yahaan syaap UPI pement opshan select karte hai
 Here also your number should be registered, if not, then option will be given
 bank acount ko bhim UPI section se link karnaa hoga
 On Paytm you also get the option of QR code and here you can send money through Aadhaar number also
 donon eps main kuch chijen alag hai, lekin UPI se tranjaction kaa concept ek hi he
 Overall, both are more or less the same
 chunki whatsap kaa pement abhi beta mod main he isliye aisa ho saktaa he ki aage kuch nae fitures die jaaen
 Further competition is expected to be even faster

 Shah Rukh Khan's film 'zero' was a flop for Ranveer Singh's film 'simba', but such a response would not have been thought by Ranveer Singh himself

 Ranveer Singh's blockbuster film Simba has become the highest grosser film

 Ranveer Singh's film 'simba' earned 200 crores in just 12 days before the completion of two weeks
 diarector rohit shetty ke liye khushi kii baat he ki 'simba' ke alaava 'golmaal agen' or 'chennai express' ne bhi 200 karod kaa aankada chune main itnaa hi samay liya tha
 In this way, Ranveer Singh's biggest solo hit of all time has become

 Huh
 gujarat main bhale hi yatayaat niyamon ke ulanghan par lagane vaale chaalaan kii daron main katautee kii gai he lekin yahaan bhi log pareshaan hai
 a surprising case has emerged from Gujarat
 darasal is baar pareshaani kii vajah se chaalaan nahin, balki ek shaks kaa sir he
 No helmet of the size of its head is present in the market
 gujarat ke chota udaipur jile ke bodoli ilaake main rahane vaale jakir memon ko police ne bina helmet gaadi chalaate hue roak liya
 Zakir had all the papers related to the car but did not wear a helmet
 police ne use jurmaana bharne ko kaha
 But when Zakir told the police his problem, the police were also surprised
 jakir nike ne kaha ki vah koi helmet nahin pahan saktaa kyonki koi bhi helmet uske sir main edjust nahin hota
 Every helmet on the market is much smaller than a man's head
 shaks ne police se kaha ki usne shahar kii har dukaan par helmet khoja lekin use aisa koi helmet koi nahin mila jo uske sir main aa jaae
 Zakir says that i am a person who respects the law
 main bhi helmet pahananaa chahta hum lekin mujhe aisa helmet miltaa hi nahin, jo sir main thik se feet ho sake
 The police are surprised to hear Zakir's problem
 jakir ne police se apil kii he ki uske maamle ko sulajhaaye, or madad kare
 At the same time, the police is also considering this demand of Zakir, accepting his problem as correct
 police ne jakir kaa chaalaan bhi nahin kaata
 The problem still remains as to where the helmet that fits this person's head comes from

 Kejriwal refused to fill the bail bond even today in the defamation case of Nitin Gadkari, following which the Patiala House Court ordered him to be sent to Tihar Jail again in judicial custody till 6 June
 adaalat ne kaha ki vah pehle ke aadesh ko nahin badalegi or agar kejariwal chahen to ise upree adaalat main chunauti de sakate hai
 The court again asked Kejriwal that what he had trouble filling the bond while it was just an affidavit
 adaalat ne kaha, kejariwal ke liye adaalat alag prakriya nahin chalaa sakati
 Kejriwal once again spoke of not filling a personal bond and appealed to the court that he be released only on affidavit
 isse purv, patiala house court ne buudhvaar ko kejariwal ko 10,000 rupee kaa bel bond na bharne ke baad do din kii nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bhej diya tha, jiske baad shaam ko aam aadmi party ke samarthakon ne tihaad jail ke baahar jamkar pradarshan kiya tha

 ayushmaan khuranupane filmi kariyar main bilkul alag role main najar aane vaale hai
 For the preparation of the movie, Ayushmann regularly took classes in the school of Divyang for 3 months
 is bare main unhone kaha, "main niyamit rup se unke shaareerik haavbhaav, vyavhaar, pratikriyaaon or baarikiyon ko samajhane ke liye teen maheene tak divyangon ke skool gaya tha"
 'who says there is no hole in the sky 
 
 ’ ye wo shabd hai jo kendriya mantri smriti irani ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko unke hi garh amethi main haraane ke baad likhe
 Although the results of Amethi are still delayed, Rahul accepts defeat in the live press conference
 jiske baad smriti kii ye pratikriya ai
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi was winning from Amethi for the last three times, but this time Smriti made a dent in his fort
 aapako bataa den ki amethi main abhi smriti irani 33 hazaar voton se aage chal rahi hai
 Smriti has got 286504 votes so far whereas Rahul Gandhi has got 253503 votes
 gauratlab he ki ye ek lambey samay ke baad hoga jab amethi se gandhi parivaar kaa koi sadsy chunaav haaregaa
 Rahul Gandhi has also won consecutive victories over Amethi in 2004, 2009 and 2014
 koun kahata he aasmaan main suraakh nahin ho saktaa 
 
 
 - Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani) Smriti Irani contested from Amethi on May 23, 2019, 2014 but lost
 uske baavjood smriti ne amethi kaa peechha nahin choda or lagaataar vahaan kaa daura karti raheen
 That is why this time there was an interesting fight, in which Smriti has won
 darasal, guuruuvaar shaam jab rahul gandhi apni press conference karne aae to unhone narendra modi ko badhai di
 And also gave a statement on Amethi
 rahul ne kaha tha, ‘aaj smriti ji amethi main jiti hai, main unhen badhai detaa hum’
 Let us tell you that Amethi is the seat where the stalwarts of the Gandhi family have contested and won
 rahul gandhi se pehle is seat se sanjay gandhi, rajeev gandhi, sonia gandhi chunaav lard or jeet chuke hai
 After the death of Sanjay Gandhi, his wife Maneka Gandhi also contested from this seat, but she lost compared to Rajiv Gandhi
 rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main 99 ke pher main fansi congress ne guuruuvaar ko ramgarh vidhansabha main jeet ke saath 100 kaa aankada hasil kar liya he
 With this, the Congress party is just 1 step away from a clear majority in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly elections
 haalanki, rajya main congress kii sarkaar nirdaliyon or bahujan samaaj party ke samarthan se chal rahi he
 But this victory has strengthened the party's position
 ramgarh vidhansabha seat par bispi pratyaashee lakshmana singh ke nidhan ke baad matdaan sthagit kar diya gaya tha
 79 according to the Election Commission in the vote held on 28 January
 04 fisadi matdaan hua tha
 In which 20 candidates entered the field
 lekin mukhya muqabla congress, bijepi or bispi ke bich tha
 Where Safia Khan, wife of former Congress MLA and AICC secretary Zubair Khan, was in the fray
 to vahiin bijepi ne ramgarh se vidhayak rahe gyandev ahuja kaa tikat katkar sukhvant singh ko maidan main utaara tha
 At the same time, the BSP had made the contest interesting by fielding Jagat Singh, son of former foreign minister Natwar Singh
 congress ke tikat par maidan main utari safia khan ne apane nikatatam pratidwandvi bijepi ke sukhvant singh ko 12228 maton se haraaya
 At the same time, BSP candidate Jagat Singh finished third
 congress se safia khan ko 83,311 or bijepi se sukhvant singh 71,083 vot mili
 Apart from the Ramgarh assembly election candidates, it was more important for the contesting parties
 khaas taur par bispi ke liye yah seat isliye myne rakhti thi kyonki haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bispi ne yahaan kii 6 vidhansabhaon main bada factor banakar ubhari thi
 This area of mewat, dominated by Jat, Dalit and Meo Muslims, was witness to violent incidents related to cow protection in the previous BJP government
 pichley saal kathith gaurakshakon ke haathon pahalu khan or umr mohammad kii hatyaon ke baad alvar jila surkhiyon main bana rahaa
 In the Alwar Lok Sabha constituency of Mewat region of Rajasthan, the Congress got 2 seats in the last assembly elections, 2 seats in the last assembly elections, 2 seats for BJP, 2 seats for BSP
 jabaki 1 seat par nirdaleey ne kabja jamaaya tha
 BJP won this seat and was trying to show that its dominance in the state is intact
 to vahiin bispi apni jeet ke jariye alvar loksabhaa main apana palada baari karne ko utsuk dikh rahi thi
 However, with the victory in Ramgarh seat, the Congress figure in the Alwar Lok Sabha constituency has increased to three, which has brought good news for the party in Alwar for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 unka kahana tha ki 'lakshminama' aitihaasik tathyon par aadhaarit ek aisi kitaab he, jisane vishwa kii kai sabhyataaon se rubaru karaane ke saath hi pehali baar yah sthapit karne kii koshish kii he ki duniya se bharat kaa sambandh keval dharm, samskruti or kala ke drushtikon se nahin balki vyapaar ke lihaaj se hua tha
 He started with a story from the thirteenth century
 faras kaa ek vyapaaree, gujarat ke teen bandargahon se vyapaar kar rahaa tha or us puure kshetra kii arthvyavastha par uskaa kaaphi asar tha
 One day he felt that he should build a mosque in this area
 vah apana prastaav lekar sthaneey vyapaariyon ke paas gaya, to unhone somnath mandir ke mukhya pujari se mil kar use jameen dilaai
 The situation was that even the structure of that mosque was passed by the head priest of the temple
 yah baat sanskrit ke do or farsi ke ek shilaalekh main likhi gai he
 World Book Fair 2019: Where is in the fair, you can read the whole detail here
 Anshuman Tiwari, who is the editor of India Today Hindi, said that when i read this thing, i understood that the whole power of India is four and a half
 Four thousand years old, the secret market and secret ideas stand together in it
 sabhyataa ko banane vaali teen shaktiyaan hai
 One is the dynasty, the second is the great power, the third is religion
 'lakshminama' ek aisi pustak he, jo aapako dharm ke us sansthaatmak pahalu tak le jaaegi, jahaan aapako yah jaanakar achraj hoga ki duniya ki sari pehali takneekein, duniya ki sari pehali librari, duniya ki sari pehali chikitsa paddati, sangeet, vaastu aadi dharm kii dein hai
 India is a unique country in the sense that it has used its religion and religious generosity to make itself financially prosperous
 'lakshminama' is baat ko rekhaankit karti he ki ek samay puri duniya kaa sona or chaandi bharat pahunch rahaa tha
 India only needed gold and silver in trade
 aisa lagata tha ki puri duniya keval bharat ke liye sona or chaandi kaa utpaadan kar rahi he, or aisa isliye sambhav tha ki bharat main duniya ke kisi bhi dharm ko sthaan dene kii jagah thi
 Its purpose was that if you come to this country with economic prosperity, then your thoughts, your religion and your faith will be given full protection
 kwang jaau main kubalai khan ke naam se bane shiv mandir kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki kwang jaau nausainik adda tha, jahaan se chol vansh ke vyapaaree china, japan tak kaarobaar karte the or unhone kubalai khan ke naam par vahaan mandir banaaya
 It was the power to absorb any thing of India that India became a gold bird
 duniya main jab bhi kabhi pratiyogita hui, vah bharat ko dhyaan main rakhkar hui
 Be it spice trade, textile or recent liberalization
 vishwa pustak mela: pehle hi din sahitya ajtak kii dhamaakedaar maujuudagidharm or arth ke gathjod par sanchaalak said ansaari ke sawaal par lekhak kaa jawaab tha ki jab aadhunik arthshaastra kaa chintan shuru hua to bharat main veda, upanishad or puraanon ke alaava ek bada kaal bachataa he, jisamen samhitaayen rachin gayi
 About two thousand such codes were created after the Upanishads and before the Puranas, but we could not preserve them
 ye samhitaayen bharat ke aarthik, saamaajik or audyogic jivan kaa niyam tay karti hai
 Referring to Chanakya, he explained how the references to the codes were found with his manuscript and how money is needed to earn money that Kautilya Theory was replaced by Adam Smith on the Peak of Capitalism
 apni baat ko aage badhaate hue unhone kaha ki unnisvin- beesvin shatabdi tak samoochee isiyat or islam is baat par ulajhaa rahaa ki karj dena thik he yaa nahin
 Whereas in India, the circulation of debt is mentioned in the sixth century
 bharat kii pracheen vyavasthaaen kalaadhan, chote kar, yahaan tak dhan kitne tareeke kaa hota he yah bhi bataati hai
 Our treatise even states that if the king has surplus money, he should invest it with the merchant and rule with his interest
 isiilie bhartiya samaaj ke paas hameshaa se satta se zyada takat rahi he
 This power was in free trade and free thought
 lekhak ne daawa kiya ki yah ek aitihaasik tathy he ki bharat kii madad ke bina duniya bhar main koi bhi bijness leader ban hi nahin saktaa
 We should know that India is a country of economic generosity
 is udaartaa ne hamen ek nirantarata di he
 The history of India is not a divisive but a connective history
 duniya ke sabase puraane or jeevant shahar bharat main hai
 Cities like Mathura and Varanasi have been alive for more than four and a half thousand years, due to these two reasons that here either remained the center of religion or the center of trade
 duniya kaa itihaas bhugolic itihaas or raajaaon ke yuddh kaa itihaas rahaa he
 a history has been within the scope of political-geographical boundaries
 doosraa manushyata kaa saarvajanik itihaas rahaa
 Referring to the brand new theory, Community Science of Religion, he said that it tells us that from where language comes out in our mind, religion comes out
 bhashaa manushya ne samvaad ke liye or duusare se judane ke liye kii or dharm kaa avishkaar bhi duusare se jodne ke liye kiya
 Referring to the construction of the oldest temple in the world, he said that religion did not create man but man created religion
 yahaan yah ullekhneey he ki 'aaj tak' vah eklauta tivi channel he, jisane 'sahitya ajtak' ke madhyam se hindi, urdu or angreji ke salanaa saahitiyik mahakumbh yojit karne ke alaava vishwa pustak meley ke lekhak manch par bhi shandaar dhang se apni upasthiti darj karai he
 The next session of the program was 'india at World Cup: Expectations and Dreams', in which Saeed Ansari interacted with former cricketer Madan Lal, a former World Cup-winning Indian cricket team member, with noted journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, author of the book 'team Democracy: The Great Story of Indian Cricket'

 ranvir singh kii film gali boy ko darshakon or critics se acchhee pratikriyaayein mil rahi hai
 It is believed that this film could prove to be the second superhit film of the year after Vicky Kaushal's Uri: The Surgical Strike
 film ke music ne release se pehle hi acha khaasaa baz creat kiya tha or is film ko bharat main rap culture kii shuruyaat ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 There is a song in Gully Boy featuring street and rap culture, which uses the speech of JNU Students Union President Kanhaiya Kumar
 azaadi naam ke gane main 2016 ke dauraan kanhaiya ke slogans ko suna ja saktaa he
 In this connection, Ranveer interacted with the film companion
 film companian main ranvir se poocha gaya ki ek taraf aapaki film main aazaadee kaa trek istemaal hua he jisamen kanhaiya kumaar kii spich he or duusari taraf aap instagram par piem narendra modi ko hag karte tasviir share karte hai
 How do you react to this contradiction as an artist? Ranveer said, "azadi is a song with which i am not directly connected
 ye gaanaa ek montaj ke taur par istemaal hua he or is gane ko dab sharma ne taiyaar kiya he
 It is definitely that i like this song very much
 iske beats kaaphi achche he
 i do not care much about things like politics, so i do not consider myself worthy to answer this question
 ""meri profeshnal or personal zindagi main abhi kaaphi kuch chal rahaa he to main apni choti si duniya main kaaphi khush hum

 Senior Judge JS Khehar has recused himself from hearing the case involving the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the diaries of Sahara Group and Birla Group
 iske alaava maamle par sunwaayee karte hue adaalat ne ek baar phir varisht vakil prashanth bhushan se pakke sabooton ke saath aane kii baat kahi
 In fact, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan filed a case against the Prime Minister in the Supreme Court citing it as a bribery case
 is maamle kii shuukravaar ko sunwaayee thi
 The court, considering the evidence presented by Prashant Bhushan as insufficient, asked him to present concrete evidence
 adaalat ne kaha ki ye aarope gambhir hai or ucch sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon ke khilaaf hai
 Since the Prime Minister of the country is being accused and the Prime Minister cannot be accused like this, if there is strong evidence, we will hear the matter further
 adaalat ne prashanth bhushan se kaha ki agar ve aise hi aarope lagaate rahenge to sanvaidhanik athurity kaa kaam karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 The court said, "we had also said earlier that we will hear only if we give any evidence in this case
" ' saath hi adaalat ne prashanth ko sabooton ke liye or samay dene kii maang par bhi aapatti uthaai
 Taking a dig at the court's objection, Prashant Bhushan said, "justice JS Khehar's file for appointment of Comptroller and Auditor General is pending with the central government and it may be that you are not hearing the case
" prashanth bhushan kii tippanee par khafa hote hue nyaayadhish khehar ne kaha, "agar aapke man main aisi baat thi to aapako pehali hi sunwaayee main kahana chahie tha
 This is wrong, you should have full confidence in the court
 " yah kehete hue justise khehar ne khud ko sunwaayee se alag karne kii baat kahi
 Justice Arun Mishra said that you are doubting the biggest court of the country
 ve isse bilkul ittefaq nahin rakhte
 He said that the charge has been leveled against the biggest constitutional body and is like contempt
 bhushan ne is par safai dete hue kaha ki vah nyaayadhishon par koi aarope nahin laga rahe hai or na hi unhen badalane kii maang kar rahe hai
 He said that it was his duty to mention it as an officer of the court so that there would be no charges later
 prashanth bhushan ne apane jawaab main kaha ki ve pradhanmantri par aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department has received all these documents from Sahara and Birla Group
 unke paas 1,500 pej kii report bhi he, jis par ve halafanama daakhil karenge
 The court said that during the last hearing, Shanti Bhushan and Ram Jethmalani had said that they would keep the evidence in the court with records, but today neither of them is there
 bataa den ki pehali sunwaayee main supreme court ne sahaara or birla group dwaara bade netaaon ko karodon rupee dene ke maamle kii vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) se jaanch karaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that because the matter is related to a large public representative, it cannot order an inquiry into the matter only
 jo kagajaat die gaye hai, unke aadhaar par jaanch nahin karai ja sakati, kyonki sahaara ke dastavej to pehle hi farji paae gaye hai
 The comments adaalat ne kaha tha ki koi bhi kisi ke naam kii computer main entry kar saktaa he, ise tavajjon nahin di ja sakati
 Petitioners can give a concrete evidence to be heard
 agar koi thos dastavej naa milen to maamle ko phir se court naa laaen
 Prashant Bhushan's petition said that the documents found in the raids of the CBI and the Income Tax Department that he had included many politicians and the chief ministers of some states were also bribed crores of rupees
 is maamle kii supreme court esaiti se jaanch karaae or sibiai or iskar vibhaag ke jabt kiye gaye kagajaton ko court main mangavaya jaae
 Now the next hearing of this case will be held on January 11
 darasal, varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne ise rishwatakhori kaa maamla bataate hue ucchtam nyaayalay main pradhanmantri ke khilaaf maamla daayar kiya tha
 The matter was heard on Friday
 adaalat ne prashanth bhushan dwaara pesh kiye sabooton ko naakaafi maanate hue unase thos saboot pesh karne ko kaha
 The court said that these allegations are serious and against those in high constitutional positions
 chunki desh ke pradhanmantri par aarope lagaae ja rahe hai or pradhanmantri par yun hi aarope nahin lagaae ja sakate, agar pukhta saboot hon to maamle kii aage sunwaayee karenge
 The court told Prashant Bhushan that if he continues to make similar allegations, it will become difficult for the constitutional authority to act
 adaalat ne kaha, 'hamane pehle bhi kaha tha ki is maamle main koi saboot denge, to hi sunwaayee karenge
 At the same time, the court also objected to the demand of giving more time to Prashant for evidence
 adaalat kii aapatti par prashanth bhushan ne adaalat kii karypranali par ungali uthaate hue kaha nyaayadhish jees khehar kii mahalekha niyantrak kii niyukti kii file centre sarkaar ke paas lambit he or shaayad yahi baat ho ki aap is maamle kii sunwaayee nahin kar rahe hai
 Expressing anger over Prashant Bhushan's remarks, Judge Khehar said, "if you had such a thing in your mind, you should have said it in the first hearing
 yah baat galat he, aapako adaalat par puraa bharosa rakhana chahie tha
 "saying this, Justice Khehar spoke of separating himself from the hearing
 justise arun mishra ne kaha ki aap desh kii sabase badi adaalat par shaq jaahir kar rahe hai
 They do not agree with this at all
 unhone kaha ki yah aarope sabase badi sanvaidhanik sanstha par lagaaya gaya he or avmaananaa jaisaa he
 Bhushan, while clarifying this, said that he is not accusing the judges nor seeking to change them
 unhone kaha ki adaalat kaa adhikari hone ke naate iskaa zikr karnaa unka ferj tha taaki baad main koi aarope na lage
 Prashant Bhushan in his reply said that he is not blaming the Prime Minister
 sahaara or birla samooh ke paas se iskar vibhaag ko ye saare dastavej mili hai
 They also have a 1,500-page report, on which they will file an affidavit
 adaalat ne kaha ki pichhali baar sunwaayee ke dauraan shanti bhushan or ram jethmalani ne kaha tha ki ve saboot record ke saath court main rakhenge, lekin aaj donon main se koi nahin he
 Explain that in the first hearing, the Supreme Court refused to conduct a probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the case of Sahara and Birla Group giving crores of rupees to the big leaders
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki kyonki maamla ek bade janpratinidhi se judaa he, sirf isliye maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh nahin de sakate
 Investigations cannot be conducted on the basis of the documents given, because Sahara's documents have already been found to be fake
 tippaniyan The court had said that anyone can enter someone's name in the computer, it cannot be given any consideration
 yachikakarta koi thos saboot de ko sunwaayee kar sakate hai
 If no concrete documents are found, do not bring the case to court again
 prashanth bhushan kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki sibiai or iskar vibhaag ke chaape main jo dastavej mili the ki unhone kai netaaon or kuch rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi shaamil hai, inako karodon rupee kii ghoose di gai thi
 The matter should be investigated by the Supreme Court of SIT and the seized papers of CBI and Income Tax Department should be brought to the court
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 11 janvari ko kii jaaegi
 The court said that these allegations are serious and against those in high constitutional positions

 Explain that in the first hearing, the Supreme Court refused to conduct a probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the case of Sahara and Birla Group giving crores of rupees to the big leaders

 Investigations cannot be conducted on the basis of the documents given, because Sahara's documents have already been found to be fake

 The matter should be investigated by the Supreme Court of SIT and the seized papers of CBI and Income Tax Department should be brought to the court
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 11 janvari ko kii jaaegi
 Taking a dig at the court's objection, Prashant Bhushan said, "justice JS Khehar's file for appointment of Comptroller and Auditor General is pending with the central government and it may be that you are not hearing the case
" prashanth bhushan kii tippanee par khafa hote hue nyaayadhish khehar ne kaha, "agar aapke man main aisi baat thi to aapako pehali hi sunwaayee main kahana chahie tha
 This is wrong, you should have full confidence in the court
 " yah kehete hue justise khehar ne khud ko sunwaayee se alag karne kii baat kahi
 Justice Arun Mishra said that you are doubting the biggest court of the country
 ve isse bilkul ittefaq nahin rakhte
 He said that the charge has been leveled against the biggest constitutional body and is like contempt
 bhushan ne is par safai dete hue kaha ki vah nyaayadhishon par koi aarope nahin laga rahe hai or na hi unhen badalane kii maang kar rahe hai
 He said that it was his duty to mention it as an officer of the court so that there would be no charges later
 prashanth bhushan ne apane jawaab main kaha ki ve pradhanmantri par aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department has received all these documents from Sahara and Birla Group
 unke paas 1,500 pej kii report bhi he, jis par ve halafanama daakhil karenge
 The court said that during the last hearing, Shanti Bhushan and Ram Jethmalani had said that they would keep the evidence in the court with records, but today neither of them is there
 bataa den ki pehali sunwaayee main supreme court ne sahaara or birla group dwaara bade netaaon ko karodon rupee dene ke maamle kii vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) se jaanch karaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that because the matter is related to a large public representative, it cannot order an inquiry into the matter only
 jo kagajaat die gaye hai, unke aadhaar par jaanch nahin karai ja sakati, kyonki sahaara ke dastavej to pehle hi farji paae gaye hai
 The comments adaalat ne kaha tha ki koi bhi kisi ke naam kii computer main entry kar saktaa he, ise tavajjon nahin di ja sakati
 Petitioners can give a concrete evidence to be heard
 agar koi thos dastavej naa milen to maamle ko phir se court naa laaen
 Prashant Bhushan's petition said that the documents found in the raids of the CBI and the Income Tax Department that he had included many politicians and the chief ministers of some states were also bribed crores of rupees
 is maamle kii supreme court esaiti se jaanch karaae or sibiai or iskar vibhaag ke jabt kiye gaye kagajaton ko court main mangavaya jaae
 Now the next hearing of this case will be held on January 11

 When elections are over, the leaders are inaugurating and inaugurating new schemes, but Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday set a record that hardly anyone can break
 unhone ek din main 5 ghante ke bheetar kareeb 60,000 karod rupee kii 900 yojanaon kaa shilanyas or locarpan kar daalaa
 It has a number of schemes which have not yet been completed, including Cricket Stadium, Cancer Institute, Multiplex, Library, Olympic Size Swimming Pool, shan-e-awadh Signature Building and Mandi Parishad Building
 aachaar samhita ke dar se udghaatano kii jaldichunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke dar seyojanaon ke locarpan or shilanyasaki kisi jaldi he, iskaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki shilanyas ke liye jin pattharon kaa anaavaran kiya gaya, un par naamon kii khudaai bhi nahin ho pai thi
 Work was carried out by pasting a sheet of plastic on granite stones
 lakhanu kii pariyojna ke locarpan ke liemukhyamantri akhilesh yadavakhud pahunche, vahiin rajya bhar kii baaki pariyojnaon ke pattharon kaa anaavaran bhi siem ne lakhanu se hi kar diya gaya

 In such a situation, Akhilesh is also being criticized for this launch of the release, but in spite of this he has been busy in launching the last one week
 iske peeche unka tark he ki abhi unke kaarykaal main chaar maheene se zyada bachaa he or nai sarkaar banane se pehle unamem se zyaadaatar yojanaayen puri ho jaaengi
 CM Akhilesh is in a hurry that election dates can be announced on any day in UP
 chunaav ayog kii team in dinon taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye upi kaa daura kar rahi he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh Yadav clearly says that why should he let anyone else take credit for the work he did

 Issues like rape, physical molestation etc
 are never discus in the class room of the school
 ghar main bhi ham aisi baton se bacchon ko dur hi rakhte hai
 But do children really not know about this? ye baat thik he ki bacchon kaa pehlaskulunakaa apana ghar hota he or vahaan unhen sirf kitaabi gyaan nahin, balki duniyaadaari or good tach or bed tach jaisi chijen bhi sikhaai jaani chahie
 But not every parent can do this
 isliye bacchon ko is najariye se avgat karaane or unhenshikshit karnekiskulki moulik jimmedaari or bhi bad jaati he
 Keeping this in mind, the principal of a school in Delhi has written an open letter to Amita Mulla Neteachers
 isamen bacchon ke saath hone vaale rape, shaareerik durvyavhaar or samaajik asamanta ke mudde ko uthaaya gaya he
 It is important for every daughter, this letter of Amitabh Bachchan, Amita Mulla, Principal of Springdales School, Delhi, believes that it is necessary to explain gender violence to children along with studying in the class room
 isliye teachers apane chaatro se is vishay par baat karen
 Amita Mulla, published in the Hindustan Times, has told in this letter that like every good habit, children also catch evils from their surroundings
 bacchon main tanaav, udaseenta, akelaapan, unke saath sexual vaayalence ke cese unako aage chalakar rape jaise jaghanya aparaadh kii ore le ja sakate hai
 Gender differences in children's thinking also come from comics, films, advertisements, video games, etc
 ladke kam umr se hi sochane lagate hai ki ladkiyaan kamjor hai or yahi cheez rape ko shakti pradarshan vaali soch kii taraf lekar jaati he
 It is also the beginning of this thing that girls should live with their rules, they cannot play outside, they should eat at a later stage, etc
 ling bhed kii neenv jab bachapan se hi dimag main baith jaaegi to aage chalakar use badalanaa behad mushkil hoga
 Therefore, attention should be paid from the beginning in school
 ye skulon kii jimmedaari bhi he ki ve bacchon main ling bhed ko na panpane den
 In school, children should be taught to treat girls as equal, respect them
 iske liye awarenes camp or duusare aayojan kiye jane chahie

 Dear teachers,students are the rainbow in our clouds
 Yet, somewhere, the skies have darkened, threatening their sense of security and safety, especially with increasing episodes of child abuse and rape across the country
 Age seems to be no bar for these crimes
 School, home and community are a melting pot of emotions, desires, attitudes and aspirations
 One may think that the energies that reside in these places are positive as they are supposed to nurture our young
 However, there's a great deal that lies at a subconscious level within the collective humanity that inhabits these places
 Feelings of intolerance, stress disorder, neglect, and sexual abuse often create attitudes that generate violent and deviant sexual behaviour among adolescents and adults
 This leads to destructive tendencies, lack of respect for self and the other, which may culminate in rape
 The challenge is to engage with children through activities, dialogues, workshops, self-help situations and inculcate in them sensitivity, a sense of healthy intimacy that helps in building confidence and developing an understanding of the other’s personal space – physical, mental and emotional
 Self-esteem, right to privacy and gender sensitivity are issues that have to be integrated within the psyche of the children as they grow
 The root of the problem lies in peer pressure, alcohol and drug abuse, media and the role models they create, and the attitudes that are endorsed during a child’s growth – of objectifying girls and women, of accepting the male gaze, and of glorifying instant gratification
 The solution to the problem lies in first valuing the girl child
 Schools and communities should plan awareness and advocacy campaigns on improving the child sex ratio, since female infanticide and foeticide continue to rise
 As long as societies are imbalanced, and more aggressively male, rapes will continue to be a growing reality
 Movies, advertisements, comics and cartoons read and watched by children often perpetuate stereotyping of gender images and offer stimulation for sexual violence
 Rape is also about a show of power
 Many images in cinema, animation and video games often show women as weak and disempowered through a patriarchal lens
 This creates confusion in a young mind, leading to passivity of action and acceptance of an unequal relationship
 Men and boys are often equal victims to the way power operates in our society
 From childhood, boys are made to believe that they are strong and need to protect girls
 That is why we have to develop attitudes at home where we sensitise our boys to have mutually respectful relationships with girls
 Patriarchy makes women and girls agents of its own construct
 They often get sucked into believing and behaving in a manner expected by society
 They are required to be quiet, not protest, fast, eat last and sacrifice, all reflections of submission
 We, as educators, must ensure that girls become activists of thought and are able to articulate their feelings of anger, protest and anguish
 We have to instil in them the belief that they have the right to make their own cultural and social choices, whether it is the dress they wear, food they eat or customs they follow
 They have the ownership of their bodies and the right to choose the person they would want to live with or not, and to take up a profession of their choice
 Schools have become centers of salvation not only in the minds of parents and children but also of the community at large
 Hence, we have the responsibility to ensure that schools go beyond being factories of academia and skill development and become laboratories of gender sensitisation, empathetic listening and understanding diversity by not demonizing or objectifying the other
 As an educator, i believe that we must continue to create linkages between the macro and the micro, bridging the external consciousness with the internal world of our young, creating a common language and vocabulary, which is human
 No one has a monopoly over suffering and submission
 This is what we have to believe We must act TOGETHER, we must act URGENTLY and we must act NOW
 Let us commit ourselves to making our students more humane towards each other

 ) piem modi ne kaha ki endie sarkaron kii yahi nishtha or yahi eemaandaaree he jiske kaaran 21veen sadi kaa yuva aashwast he
 He said that Bihar has always been a land of education and talent
 yahaan se nikle IAS-IPS or civil seva ke anya afasar desh ko aage badhaane main bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 The Digital India campaign is an example of how we are delivering technology from poorest to poorer to give new heights to the hopes and dreams of every village of Bihar
 aakhir ye paise kahaan se aae? piem modi ne kaha ki agar garib kii jaraa si bhi parvaah hoti, agar desh kii jaraa si bhi parvaah hoti, to bhrashtachar karne se pehle inke haath kaanpate
 What did Bihar, which he trusted for decades, give Bihar except for infamy? He said that these people have betrayed you
 jis jati ke naam par in logon ne raajnneeti kii, us jati se inhen party chalaane ke liye koi yogya vyakti nahin mila
 Does such a large party not have the ability to handle the party? The caste and society who blindly made their family the owner of billions and trillions, gave the carriage-bungalow-post-prestige everything, also betrayed them
 inhone desh ko kuch nahin diya, bihar ko kuch nahin diya, apni jati ko bhi kuch nahin diya
 Not only this, in order to maintain dominance over the other people of his caste, the good promising young people in the caste also put him on the path of bullying
 piem modi ne kaha ki naujavaanon ko jati ke naam par bhramit karke, unke kandhe par bandook rakhkar, inhone apane hi samaaj or jati ko bandhak bana liya
 He said that we have resolved to double the income of the farmer by 2022, have taken up the task of making the Annadata a solar energy donor
 iske liye beej se bazaar tak nai vyavasthaaen khadi kii ja rahi hai
 For small expenses related to farming, we have started depositing money directly in the bank account of farmers under the PM Kisan Yojana
 piem modi ne kaha ki isi tarah jo hamaare pashupaalak saathi hai, unke liye pehali baar kisaan credit card ke madhyam se rin kii vyavastha hamane kii he
 Our inspiration is butter-eating Bal Gopal
 hamaari prerana bansuri bajaane vaale kanhaiya hai
 So our inspiration is Lord Krishna, who runs the Sudarshan Chakra
 piem modi ne kaha ki jab-jab jarurat padegi bharat, aatankiyon ko kuchalane ke liye sudarshanchakra dhari krishna kaa rup lekar bhi karrwai karegaa
 PM Modi did not miss mentioning the Sikh riots here too
 unhone kaha ki 1984 ke sikh narsanhaar ke liye congress ke namadaaron ke bayaan aapane sune hai
 Instead of apologizing for that gruesome massacre, they are saying - 'hua to Hua'
 piem modi ne kaha ki namadaaron kii, congress kii asli sachai yahi he

 soshal media par in dinon khaane-pine kii kuch aisi chijen jamkar share ho rahi hai jise dekhakar aapke hosh ud jaaenge
 Yes, plastic cabbage, plastic egg and plastic shiny white rice
 aapako sabase pehle sunaate hai plastic kii pattagobhi kaa sach
 This fake cabbage, prepared in just 40 seconds, has created panic on social media
 40 second ke is video ko abtak lakhon baar dekha ja chukaa he
 It is being claimed about the video that it is from China and that China is supplying synthetic cabbage all over the world
 sawaal ye he ki kya bharat main synthetic pattagobhi kii khep pahunch chuki he? kya china sach main synthetic pattagobhi kii supplai karata he? kya synthetic pattagobhi khaane se maut ho sakati he? ye pattagobhi nakli he, yaa phir ye video?soshal media par pattagobhi ko lekar hamane sach jaanane kii koshish kii
 During the search on the internet, we found many such videos which can surprise anyone
 lekin sabase zyada chaunkaanewaala video ye tha, jisamen daawa kiya gaya he ki synthetic pattagobhi ab bharat ke bazaar main bhi maujuud he
 The video shows how what happened when an attempt was made to burn this cabbage looking real on a gas stove
 lakh koshishon ke baad naa to ye puri tarah se jala or naa hi haath se iske pattey ko todaa ja sakaa
 As the picture of such synthetic cabbage continues to emerge on social media, we expanded its scope of investigation
 dilli kii sabase badi sabzi mandi main plastic kii pattagobhi ko lekar alag alag tarah kii raay mil rahi thi
 So we also decided to do the cabbage burning test itself
 kai minuton kii koshishon ke baavjood hamaari pattagobhi bhi nahin jali, to kya ye bhi plastic kii he
 Or its not burning only because of the moisture in the leaves
 darasal jab patta gobhi puraani ho jaati to uske pattey kaaphi mote ho jate hai or jalaane-pakaane main mushkil bhi
 Now let me tell you that in the first video you saw the process of making synthetic cabbage, it is from Japan
 jahaan numaaish ke liye aisi sabzi 1920 se banaai ja rahi he
 They are used for display in restaurants
 khaane ke liye nahin
 The second 40-second video that is going viral is from a business publication in the Philippines
 isane logon ko alert karne ke liye ye video jari kiya tha
 In this video, people were warned to stay alert due to China's move on synthetic vegetables
 haalanki china baar baar is par safaai bhi de chukaa he

 Saha, who scored a century in the IPL final for Kings XI Punjab, said that even though the perspective is completely different, i would call the Adelaide Test's 35-run innings and century partnership with Virat Kohli for the sixth wicket closer to my heart

 In Bihar, the state government can take action against Tejashwi Yadav, leader of the opposition, in the matter of making the government bungalow like a 7 star hotel
 bihar ke bhawan nirmaan mantri maheshwar hajaari ne kaha ki vibhaag unke bangale main hue kharch kaa akalan kar rahaa he
 He said that if the money was spent in the written order of the former Deputy Chief Minister, then definitely action will be taken against him
 tejasvi yadav ko jis samay 5 deshratn maarg alot kiya gaya tha, us samay wo na keval bihar ke upmukhyamantri the balki bhawan nirmaan mantri ke saath saath path nirmaan mantri ke pad par bhi asin the
 The limit of spending on furniture in ministers' own residence in Bihar was 3 lakhs when Tejashwi Yadav was a minister, but now it has increased to 6 lakhs
 maheshwar hajaari ne kaha ki bangale main ek palang kii keemat hi 6 lakh hogi
 The expenditure of crores on the common goods in the bungalow can be seen clearly
 unhone kaha ki puraa akalan hone ke baad jo bhi vidhi sammat karrwai kerani hogi, karenge chaahe wo bade se bada vyakti kyon na ho, us par bhi vidhi sammat karrwai hogi
 The bungalow is now allotted to Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 unka kahana he ki yah bangala kisi 7 star hotel se kam nahin he
 Its furnishing is 100 times better than the Chief Minister's residence and Raj Bhavan
 maheshwar hajaari ne kaha ki mujhe bhi aashcharya ho rahaa he kyonki ham log janata ke dwaara chune jate hai
 Is the people's representative janata kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karnaa ham logon kaa kaam rahata he, jo vyakti apane sukh bhoga main itnaa dub jaataa he
 it's unfortunate
 unhone kaha ki abhi ye maamla saamne aayaa he
 It will be important to see how much money has been spent in it
 kahaan se itnaa paisa lagaaya gaya
 On whose orders it happened
 agar vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke str se kharch hua hoga to unhen dand milegaa or agar ye sara kharch us samay ke bhawan nirmaan mantri tejasvi yadav ke likhit aadesh par hua he to un par bhi vidhi sammat karrwai hogi
 In fact, during the hearing of a dispute regarding the official bungalow of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on January 7 this year, the Patna High Court took automatic cognizance and asked the question, under which law the former Chief Minister in Bihar is using the facility of lifetime accommodation? Maheshwar Hazari said that it was due to Tejashwi Yadav that the bungalows allotted to former chief ministers were also taken away on the orders of the High Court
 unhone kaha ki purv mukhyamantriyon main dow
 If Jagganath Mishra and Satish Kumar are not in any position, then their bungalow will be taken back
 jabaki purv mukhyamantri rabari devi abhi vidhaan parishad main pratipaksh kii netaa hai or purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi abhi varisht vidhayak he to is par abhi vichaar hona baaki he ki unhen usee bangale main rahane diya jaayegaa yaa koi anya bangala unhen aavantit kii jaae
 What does International Business Broker have to do with Kashmir? Why did the Indian government need an international broker in Kashmir? The plan to take the mps of the European Union to India, Kashmir, the name of the unknown NGO prepared through which has come out
 yah samaj se baahar kii baat he ki saansadon ko bulaakar kashmir le jane ke liye bharat ne anaupchaarik channel kyon chunaa? kya isliye ki kashmir ke masale main tisare paksh ko nyautane kii aupchaarik shuruuaat ho jaaegi? lekin international bijnes brokar kehane vaali maadi(madhu) sharma ke zarie saansadon kaa daura karakar kya bharat ne kashmir ke masale main tisare paksh kii anaupchaarik bhoomika sweekaar nahin kii ?britain ke libral democratic party ke saansad kris devies ko maadi sharma ne email kiya he
 In an email sent on October 7, Madi Sharma says that she is conducting a delegation of parties from across Europe
 is viipi pratinidhimandal kii pradhanmantri modi se mulaaqaat karai jaaegi or agle din kashmir kaa daura hoga
 The date of the meeting with Prime Minister Modi in the email is 28 October and the date of going to Kashmir is 29 October
 zaahir he email bhejne se pehle bharat ke pradhanmantri modi kii sahmati lee gai hogi
 Only then can someone promise a date and visit
 bagair sarkaar ke kisi agyaat paksh kii sakriyata ke yah kaam ho hi nahin saktaa
 This email would never have come out if MP Chris Davies had not placed a bet on his behalf
 devies ne maadi sharma ko sahmati dete hue likhaa ki ve kashmir main bagair suraksha ghere ke logon se baat karnaa chahenge
 Just on October 10, Madi Sharma wrote to Davis that it would not be possible without security because the armed squad kept roaming there
 yahi nahin ab or saansadon ko le janaa mumkin nahin
 In this way the Davis leaf is cut
 kris devies north west britain se european sangh main saansad hai
 He said that people of Kashmir live in his area who are unable to talk to their families
 devies ne media se kaha he ki ve modi sarkaar ke jansampark kaa hissaa nahin hona chaahate ki kashmir main sab thik he
 Madi Sharma has a Twitter account, not even three thousand people follow her
 pradhanmantri modi ke saath unki tasviren hai
 They also have independent status
 unki profil bataati he ki ve myanmar main rohingya se lekar china main ughur musalamaanon ke saath ho rahi ninsaafi se chintit hai or galat maanati hai
 Why does such a thinking Madi Sharma call mps who hate Islam and are staunch Christians? Who advocate not to give any rights to Migrant
 maadi sharma khud ko gandhivadi bataati hai
 Gandhi has words on his site
 maadi sharma kaa ek enjio he
 WESTT Women's Economic and Social Think Tank
 is enjio kii taraf se ve saansadon ko email karti hai or likhti hai ki aane jane kaa kiraaya or thaharne kaa prabandh koi or sanstha karegaa jiskaa naam he International Institute for non-aligned Studies
 The office of this institution is in Safdarjung, Delhi
 1980 main bani yah sanstha nirgut deshon ke andolan ko lekar sabha-seminar karana he
 When have you heard about outlandish countries? Why would this organization set up for the Nirgut movement hire 27 mps from the European Union? Its website does not know who is its president? Now the question is why did India resort to Madi Sharma? Many times President Trump said that if India wants Pakistan, then they are ready to intervene
 bharat ne thukraa diya
 India was not impressed by Imran Khan's speech at the United Nations
 kashmir par turki or malaysia kii aalochana se bharat ne aise jataayaa jaise farq na padaa ho
 Even when questions were raised about Kashmir in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Congress, India also expressed that it does not matter
 bharat kii taraf se jataayaa jaataa rahaa ki kai deshon ko breef kiya gaya he or ve bharat ke saath hai
 Most of the countries above did not say anything special to India that caused more trouble
 balki jab pakistan ne videshi rajanyikon or patrakaron ko apane adhikrut kashmir kaa daura karaayaa to bharat main mazaaq udaaya gaya
 After all, what happened to India that the role of foreign mps coming to Kashmir was prepared through an international business broker? The mps who have been called are from right wing parties
 inamen koi aisi party nahin he jinaki sarkaar ho yaa pramukh awaz rakhte hon
 Out of 751 seats in the European Union, the number of such mps does not exceed 73
 to bharat ne kashmir par ek kamjor paksh ko kyon chunaa? kya pramukh dalon se man mutabiq saath nahin mila? amareeki sinetter ko kashmir jane kii anumati na dekar bharat ne is maamle main amareeki dabaav ko kaarij kar diya
 Then why did India have to prepare the role of calling these mps? Didn't Davies make Madi Sharma's email public and weaken India's favor? Does not doing all this internationalize the issue of Kashmir? Has Kashmir not become more internationalized than before? Today, the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations has tweeted that human rights are being violated in Kashmir
 bharat ke liye kashmir abhinn ang he
 If there is an internal matter then why does India prepare from the back door in the matter of calling foreign mps? Only then will the press conference be held to get the right answer
 abhi tak koi bayaan bhi nahin aayaa he
 It is a matter of concern that all this information is being kept away from crores of Hindi readers
 unhen kashmir par andhere main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Why so ? Keep an eye on the reporting of Hindi newspapers regarding Kashmir
 buudhvaar ke akhbaar main european sangh ke saansadon ke daure kii khabar ko gaur se padhein or dekhen ki kya ye sab jaankaree di gai he? kashmir par raajnneetik safalataa tabhi milegi jab upi bihar ko andhere main rakhaa jayega
 The channels which were referring to the author or leader as traitors for the article on Kashmir being re-tweeted in another country till yesterday, those channels who were speaking on Kashmir in another country were called traitors Are welcome

 ' Naxalism has become a cancer today but it seems that despite knowing everything in Jharkhand, the police and administration are turning their eyes from this side
 aaj tak ko haath lagi naksaliyon kii ek levi diary, jo bataati he ki naksaliyon kii aamadani kaa jariya kya he
 The two-year-old diary is present with the Jharkhand Police, despite this the police neither took it seriously nor inquired from the levy holders
 jabaki kanoon kii najar main levi dene vaale bhi utane hi doshi hai, kyonki yahi naksalwad ke sabase bade poshak hai
 The amount recorded in front of various names in the raw levy diary of the Jharkhand Police is in lakhs
 bhale hi ye diary do saal puraani he lekin ye to sirf ek baangi he, aise na jane kitne naam honge jinhen naksaliyon ne apane aatank se saadh liya he
 Due to this money, different organizations of Naxalites have created a furore in Jharkhand and if sources are to be believed, all these organizations raise crores every month
 police sutron kii maane to emsisi akele jharkhand main salanaa 135 se 145 karod kii vasuuli karata he
 It is worth noting that Jharkhand is full of iron and bauxite, coal, stone, mica and related industries and these places have been dominated by Naxalites
 aapako ye jaanakar hairat hogi ki akele jharkhand main naksaliyon ke 13 chote-bade sanghathan maujuud hai, jo khanan se lekar transporting tak ke har kaam ke liye moti rakam vasuulata he, jisamen PLFI or MCC kaa dabadabaa sabase adhik he
 Despite the name of the alleged diary and the refusal of the Naxalites who have been caught so far, the police have never called for any action against those running these industries nor taken any legal action in this direction
 aise main naksali apane vasuuli ke kaam ko badastoor jari rakhe hue hai
 The Election Commission has given a clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) in violation of the Model Code of Conduct
 chunaav ayog ne baithak ke baad kaha ki piem modi ne aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin kiya he
 At the same time, Congress leader Kapil Sibal has criticized the Election Commission
 congress ke diggaj netaa kapil sibbal ne aachaar samhita ko ek nayaa naam diya he or 'model code of conduct' ko 'modi code of conduct' bataaya he
 In fact, he had violated the Code for the first time in his speech in Wardha, Maharashtra on 1 April where he had allegedly raised the issue of saffron terrorism
 saath hi piem modi ne yuva votaron ko apana pehla vot sena ke naam par dene kii apil kii thi
 Kapil Sibbl made a tweet on Tuesday and wrote- 'modi- 40 TMC mlas are in touch with me
 modi- kya aapkaa pehla vot un vir javaanon ko samarpit ho saktaa he, jinhone pakistan nen air strike ko anjaam diya
 Where is the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)
 ab emsisi modi code of conduct ho gaya he
 In fact, Congress MP Sushmita Dev had complained against PM Modi for violating the election code of conduct
 sushmita dev ne apni yachika main piem narendra modi or amit shah dwaara apni sabhaaon main adarsh aachaar samhita ke kathith ulanghan kii anek ghatnaon ko soochibaddh kiya tha
 Sushmita Dev had said that Modi had violated the Code for the first time in his speech in Wardha, Maharashtra on 1 April where he had allegedly raised the issue of saffron terrorism
 chunaav ayog ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko wardha main diye unke us bhaashan ke liye mangalvaar ko clin chit de di jisamen unhone vynad seat se chunaav ladane ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii aalochana kii thi or ‘sanket' diya tha ki kerala ke is sansadeey kshetra main alpsankhyak samudaay ke matadaataaon kii sankhya adhik he
 a spokesperson of the Election Commission said, "A detailed investigation was conducted into the case under the existing guidelines / provisions of the Model Code of Conduct, under the Representation of People's Act and according to the report of the Chief Electoral Officer of Maharashtra
 jiske anusaar ayog kaa yah vichaar he ki is maamle main aisa koi ulanghan nahin dikhaa he
 The Congress had approached the Election Commission earlier this month and demanded action against Prime Minister Modi's 'divisive' speech
 pradhanmantri ne gat ek april ko wardha main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kathith rup se kaha tha ki vipakshi dal loksabhaa kii un siton se apane netaaon ko khadaa karne se ‘‘darataa'' he jahaan bahusnkhyakon kaa prabhutv he
 He made the above remarks, pointing to Congress President Rahul Gandhi's decision to contest from Kerala's Wayanad as the second seat
 rahul gandhi uttar pradesh ke amethi se bhi chunaav lard rahe hai
 Modi reportedly said, "congress has insulted Hindus and the people of the country have decided to punish the party in elections
" us party ke netaa ab un loksabhaa siton se chunaav ladane se dar rahe hai jahaan bahusankhyak (hindu) jansankhya kaa prabhutv he
 For this reason they are obliged to seek refuge in places where the majority are in the minority

 pulavama hamalaa hue aath din ho gaye
 Still haven't been able to think what to do
 hamale ke baad fouran hi kuch nayaa kahana bhi jaruri tha
 So a statement was issued to allow the military to do anything politically
 sarkaar ne kaha ki sena jo karnaa chaahe use vah karne kii anumati he
 Apart from this, another work was done
 sarkaar ne pakistan kaa sarvaadhik tarjihi desh kaa darja khatm kar diya
 Overall, it is to be seen now what the army thinks of doing a big job
 rahi baat tarjihi darje kii to uske asar kaa pataa chalane main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Currently the effect is that tomatoes have become expensive in Pakistan
 iske alaava dekhne ko kuch he to vah he apane desh kii janata kaa banataa yaa vakt kii maang ke mutabik janata kaa banaaya jaataa rukh
 We try to show or create atmosphere by calling on behalf of the public through the media
 media ke jariye janata kaa ek hi swar gunjaaya gaya ki padosi par hamalaa bol do, yani yuddh
 Well this is not a new suggestion
 pichley ek dashak main jab kabhi bhi seemaa par yaa seemaa ke andar chhadmayuddh main apane phogiyon kii jaane gayi tab kuch dinon tak yahi yani yuddh chhedane kii aawaaj sunai detii hai
 There are some recent experiences that with the passage of time, this voice also disappears
 lekin is baat ko koun nakaar saktaa he ki haal ke dinon main desh par aatankwaadi hamalon main kami nahin ai or na hi apane javaanon kii jaan jane kaa silsilaa thama
 This is terrorism for us and this is such a complex problem that is becoming permanent
 or yah aisi samasya he jo sirf hamaari hi nahin balki duniya ke bade-bade dabang deshon kii bhi he
 He is not even thinking what to do
 vishwasaneey upaay nadaarad hai
 There is only momentary anger to do
 or cruddh hokar yuddh kaa taatkaalik junun he
 The second motive for punishment is resistance
 yani aisa dand dena ki apradhi dobaaraa aparaadh na kare
 At the same time, punishing a criminal, and fearing that others should not commit the crime
 lekin aatankwaad kii maujuuda shakl main ugravadi apni jaan ko hatheli par rakhkar apana kaam karne lage hai
 In such a situation, the death penalty for resistance is proved inadequate at first sight
 kitabon main dand kaa teesraa makasad praayshchit he
 By keeping the criminal away from society, in prison, in solitude, it is hoped that the criminal will get the chance of atonement
 khayr yah aadhyatmik prakaar kaa makasad he or abhi pataa nahin kiya ja sakaa ki aatankwaad jaise maamle main kitna kargar ho saktaa he
 The fourth measure is improvement
 bhartiya dand pranali ailaania taur par dandopachaaratmak he
 Such a system recognizes punishment as the culprit
 uskaa upachaar sambhav he
 But it remains to be seen that when we are not able to achieve any special success in the work of reforming ordinary criminals, then in case of terrorism, it is a distant thing
 paanchavaa makasad sudhare hue apradhi ke punarvaas kaa hota he
 That is, by reforming the criminal and getting them resettled in the society
 lekin kai kaarnon se jahaan sudhaar hi lagbhag naakaam he vahaan punarvaas kii baat phijul hi he

 bharat kepahale pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehrune kareeb do dashakon tak netaji subhash chandra bose ke rishtedaaron kii jasusi karwaai thi
 This has been revealed by two Intelligence Bureau (IB) files recently removed from the secret list
 filon se pataa chalaa he ki 1948 se 1968 ke bich subhash chandra bose ke parivaar padhbhootpurv nigaraneerakhi gai thi
 For 16 of these 20 years, Nehru was the Prime Minister of the country and the IB used to work under him

 One was at Woodburn Park and the other at 38 / 2 Elgin Road
 bose ke gharon kii jasusi britishraj main shuru hui thi, lekin chaunkaane vaali baat he ki isenehru sarkaarne bhi kareeb do dashak tak jari rakhaa
 In the IB headquarters, home of the Bose family, based in Woodburn Park, detectives intercepting and keeping an eye on the letters of the Bose family, IB spies also spied their local and foreign travels
 aisa lagata he ki agency yah jaanane ko aatur thi ki bose ke rishtedaar kisase milte hai or kya charchaa karte hai
 Some handwritten messages have revealed that IB agents used to call in the IB headquarters, known as 'security control', about the activities of the Bose family
 haalanki is jasusi kii vajah puri tarah saaf nahin ho pai he
 The IB kept a close watch on Netaji's nephews Shishir Kumar Bose and Amiya Nath Bose

 According to him, 'the government was not sure about whether Bose is alive now or not
 sarkaar ne sochaa hoga ki agar vah jinda honge to kolkata main apane parivaar se sampark jarur karte honge
 But what reason did Congress have to fear? The country welcomes Bose's return
 lekin shaayad yahi dar kaa kaaran tha
 At that time, Bose was the only charismatic leader who could challenge the Congress in 1957 by uniting the opposition against the Congress
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki agar bose jinda hote to vah gathbandhan jisane 1977 main congress ko haraaya, vah yah kaam 1962 main hi kar dete, yani 15 saal pehle

 As Ahmad Rahmouni, the head of the Association of Tunisian Magistrates, told The Guardian last week, not only are the brutal modalities of the police and intelligence services intact, but judges who remained loyal to Ben Ali continue to be servants of power rather than justice Huh
 rahamauni kaa kahana tha, ''desh ke bade nyaayadhish bhrasht hai or taanaashaahee ke upkaran hai

 Elections have been repeatedly postponed and there is now a discussion that there was no revolution, but a military coup, after Mubarak was ousted from power in February

 Since there is no international sanction, there is no united opposition, nor is there any desire to open a second military front in the capitals of the western countries and there is a very different situation of ground-level entrenchment, in such a way from NATO there The possibility of a new intervention is very slim

 Therefore, the fight is to fill the void that will be born out of the abolition of pan-arabism in the 1960s and 1970s
 iske ekadam spasht dikh rahe daavedaar islamic almbardaar hai
 And undoubtedly the third major factor that needs to be monitored is the role of politicized religion
 iran ko chhodkar haalanki kisi bhi desh main islamic almbaradaaron ne satta nahin hathiyaan he, lekin pashchim samarthit ghoosekhor or nikamme sthaneey shaskaon ke sangathit, daksh, eemaandaar or saanskrithik taur par hdhamanik vikalp ke rup main unki lokapriyata haal ke varshon main teji se badi he
 In Egypt, Tunisia and other countries, the Islamic Alambardars were the main opposition and have faced severe repression
 isliye kranti ke baad ke matadaataaon main unki vah saakh barkaraar he, jiskaa muqabla dharmanirpeksh or aksar ucch madhyam varg ke rajnatik dal nahin kar sakate
 In Tunisia, Nahda's liberal Islamic alumnus is expected to receive maybe 20 percent or more of the vote in Sunday's election
 mistra main bhi yadi koi chunaav hue to unka pradarshan acha rahegaa
 Yes, in Libya, of course, Gaddafi's half-baked political philosophy and repression system, despite the accumulated spending of religion, hurt the deep piety of most of the population and the fanatical Islamist sentiments of a small class

 These conflicts will eventually be overcome, but after considerable political instability
 majahab duusari rajnatik bhoomika bhi nibhaa saktaa he
 One of the reasons for the Egyptian military's violence over a demonstration of Egyptian ancient Christian (kaptic) minorities is the deep uneasiness that has now arisen with the new possibilities available to minorities in Egypt
 satta or sampada ke vitaran kii vyavastha ke kayapalat ke yahi avasar ab bahrain ke shiyaon yaa syria ke sunniyon or jordan ke philistiniyon sareekhe bahusnkhyakon ke liye khul rahe hai or isse un logon ke bich bhi utani hi bechaini ubhar rahi he, jo puraani satta se phayda uthaate rahe hai
 Then there are the vast array of alliances and loyalties that go beyond India and beyond the Atlantic Sea

 This is of course another big factor

 But the biggest fear in Riyadh is the one-to-one collapse of Sunni Allied powers in the region, and the benefits to Iran from a more aggressive offensive

 It is unclear how India — which has recently been closer to Iran than Saudi Arabia — will take advantage of the instability in the Middle East at this time
 abhi tak kii bhartiya niti ko bahut udaar man se kahen to vah 'chatur niskriyata' kii niti rahi he
 But in a deeper view, it can be more clearly called a policy of aimlessness or directionlessness than adopting a policy of minimum resistance in disguise to support national sovereignty
 agar bharat apni aawaaj or prabhaav ko mukhar bananaa chahta he, to use kade faisle lekar ek spasht niti taiyaar kerani hogi or use saaf shabdon main vyakt karnaa hoga
 If India wants to do this and whenever it wants to do, it must remember a warning - local aspects will be most important

 com / qjwhotfd6h Jan-gana-mana was given the status of the national anthem of India on 24 January 1950 on this day
 vahiin ham bharat ke nivasee apana raashtragan jan gana man tab se gaate aa rahe hai jab ham skool main hua karte the, lekin kya ham sab iske bare main isse zyada kuch or jaanate hai ki ise rabindranath tagore ne likhaa tha?jaane- raashtragan se judi kuch khaas baaten
 
 
 - It was first sung at the Kolkata (then Calcutta) meeting of the Indian National Congress on 27 December 1911, when people outside Bengal did not know it
 samvidhan sabha ne jan gana man ko bharat ke raashtragan ke rup main 24 janvari 1950 ko apanaaya
 However it was written in Bengali in the year 1905
 jab naukar ko dil de baithi thim britain kii maharani victoria
 
 
 - Jana Gana Mana was made a national anthem because of its meaning
 iske kuch anshon kaa arth hota he ki bharat ke naagarik, bharat kii janata apane man se aapako bharat kaa bhagya vidhaataa samajhati he
 o Adhinayak (superhero), you are the fortune-teller of India
 iske saath hi isamen desh ke alag- alag rajyon kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya tha or unki khoobiyon ke bare main bataaya gaya tha
 The Indian son-in-law of Japan was Yeh Bose, got the second highest award- Let me tell you, Vaden Mataram was also said to be making the national anthem but he was made a national anthem because his first four lines are dedicated to the country, the latter in the Bengali language
 And mother Durga has been praised
 kisi bhi aise geet ko raashtragan bananaa uchit nahin samajha gaya jisamen desh kaa na hokar kisi devi-devtaa kaa zikr ho
 Hence Vande Mataram was made a national anthem by not making a national anthem
 PAK main 7 saat saal tak 'dharm' badalakar rahe NSA ajit dobhaal- bataa den ki raashtragan ko puraa gane main 52 second kaa samay lagata he jabaki iske sanskaran ko chalaane kii avadhi lagbhag 20 second he
 There are 5 posts in the national anthem
 rabindranath tagore ne raashtragan ko naa keval likhaa balki unhone ise gaaya bhi
 It was sung in Madanpillai, a small district in Andhra Pradesh
 - bataa den ki raashtragan se judi kuch khaas bate hai jo ise gaate samay dhyaan main rakhni chahie
 The most important of which is that one should stand in a careful position while singing
 bharat ke suranjay singh ne rashtramandal khelon kii mukkebaaji spardhaa ke flivet (52 kilo) varg main pakistan ke haaron ikbaal ko haraakar final main pravesh kiya
 Desi kattas were already being manufactured in Munger, Bihar, but now foreign weapons are also being illegally made there
 yun samaj sakate hai ki pradhanmantri rojgaar yojana se mili raashi kaa istemaal kar hi avaidh hathiyaar nirmaataa ab ultra modern hathiyaar bana rahe hai
 Our story is based on this black market of weapons
 
 
 is jile main ek kendriya yojana yahaan ke hathiyaar banane vaale logon kii madad kar rahi he
 Bihar's Munger has been a traditional center for the production of indigenous weapons and till recently the district was notorious for one-shot desi katta
 ab yahaan sarkari yojana ke paise se videshi pistaulen or revolver bhi banaae jane kaa chalan shuru ho chukaa he
 It is different that everything is illegal
 jile ke police sutron ke mutabik, is kshetra ke kai naujavaanon ne pradhanmantri rojgaar yojana (piemrwai) or duusare kalyankari kaaryakramon se milane vaale karj ke paise se leth yani kharad ke kaarkaane laga liye hai
 The lathe is actually used to make parts for small gun factories
 piemrwai kii shuruyaat 2 aktubar, 1993 ko garib berozegaar yuvaaon ko khud ke chote-chote rojgaar udhyam lagane main madad ke liye kii gai thi
 Initially this scheme was implemented only in urban areas but since 1994-95 it is being implemented in villages also
 munger ke police adheekshak naveen kumaar jha bataate hai, “ham un logon kaa byora pataa kar rahe hai, jinhone chote-chote shastr kaarkaane lagane ke naam par sarkari yojana ke tahat lone liya or kharad ke kaarkaane lagaae hai
 Before Jha, M
 had been the Superintendent of Police
 sunil nayak ne aise 14 gaiyr-kanoonee shastr kaarkaanon kaa pataa lagaaya tha, jinhen unke kaarykaal main piemrwai se lone lekar pratibandhit shastr nirmit karne ke liye sthapit kiya gaya tha
 Nayak, currently posted as Superintendent of Police of West Champaran, says, "the lathe factories are used for other purposes, but in Munger they have also been used in the manufacture of weapons
 maine aise 20 logon ko giraftaar kiya he jo kharad mashiinon kaa istemaal hathiyaar banane main kar rahe the
 After the recent seizure of 99 'made in Munger' pistols in Delhi, the Special Cell of Delhi Police also came to know that the loan taken from PMRY is being used to manufacture guns locally
 piemrwai se milane vaale lone kaa durupyog chaunkaane vaali baat bhale ho, lekin isse kahin zyada dilachasp ghatana pichley dinon saamne ai
 a small arms factory was caught on a boat in the middle of the Ganges
 munger kii jila police jo ek lambey samay se yahaan hathiyaar banane ke tamaam tareekon kii gavaah rahi he, usne bhi tairta hua kaarkaana dekhakar daanton tale ungali dabaa lee
 The Superintendent of Police says, "they were putting a lathe machine on a boat and when we surrounded them they were busy making guns
 ” jaahir he, phir isamen koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie ki desh main sabase zyada leth mashiinon ke kaarkaanon vaale shahar ke rup main munger kii khyaati he
 According to the assessment of the police, there are still around 300 arms factories in the district, despite the fact that the police have attacked many arms smugglers in the last few years
 aagneyastron se pate hue ek shahar main police kaa kaam itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hota
 Recently, when the police raided a gang of arms smugglers in the village of Bardha in the district, the entire village turned back and chanted the police, led by the women
 jha bataate hai, “mahilaayein hamalaa bolne waalon kii aguai kar rahi thim, jinhone police ke jabt kiye gaye chah gaiyr-kanoonee hathiyaaron ko na sirf waapas chin liya balki pulisavaalon par duvryavhaar kaa bhi aarope laga diya
 According to the Munger Police, Bardha is the center for the manufacture of illegal weapons
 jha bataate hai, “bamushkil hi gaanv main koi aisa ghar hoga, jahaan hathiyaar na banate hon
 Most of the residents of this place have been caught in this charge many times
 jaise hi unhen jamaanat milti he, ve lautakar waapas apane kaam main lag jate hai
 Jha says that Mohammad Feroz Alam, who was arrested by Delhi Police with 99 pistols, has been arrested earlier
 unheen ke shabdon main, “darasal, gaiyr-kanoonee hathiyaaron ke nirmaan main lipt 80 fisadi logon ko kai baar giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 "that is why the Munger police were not surprised when Alam and Niranjan Mishra were arrested in Delhi
 jha ek baar phir yahaan jodate hai, “kahin or 99 pistolon kii baramadagi ek badi ghatana maaloom ho sakati he, lekin ham to kareeb-kareeb har hafte itane hi hathiyaar jabt karte hai
 Not even a week goes by when we do not raid any illegal gun factory
 ” Indian captain Virat Kohli's hunger for victory makes the Indian team a contender for victory in the Test series still being played against Australia
 yah maananaa he westeindies ke diggaj ballebaaj vivian richards kaa
 He said these things while talking to IANS from the news agency in Kolkata
 gauratlab he ki 4 maichon kii test siries kaa pehla match bharat ne jeeta tha
 Australia have equalized the series 1–1 by winning the second match played in Perth
 donon tiimon ke bich teesraa match boxing de yani 26 disambar se shuru hoga
 Brand Ambassador Richards of the American University of Antiga (AUA) College of Madison said that Kohli's leadership and fighting stubbornness still kept India in the series
 vivian richards ne shuukravaar ko ieenes se kaha, 'bharat ke paas siries jeetne kaa shandaar mauka he
 She may have lost in Perth, but she can win now
 uske paas viraat jaisaa captain he
 He has a hunger to win and to inspire his players to win
 He knows that the West Indies legend admitted that Australia is a great team at home without Steven Smith and David Warner
 vivian richards ne kaha ki main abhi bhi bharat ko jeet kaa prabal daavedaar maanata hum, lekin kisi ko bhi yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie kii australia smith or warner ke alaava bhi shandaar team he
 He is fulfilling the talent he does not have from his perspective
 kohli kii hameshaa prashansa karne vaale richards ne kaha he ki bhartiya captain ko sarvakalik mahaan khilaadiyon main abhi khadaa karnaa jaldbaaji hogi
 For this, his career will have to wait for now
 richards ne kaha ki maujuuda daur ke khilaadiyon main viraat mere pasandida hai
 i have many scales
 mujhe lagata he ki hamen unke kariyar ke khatm hone kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 If we discuss this now, it will be hasty, but certainly he is in a fantastic position
 sunil gavaskar ko 'godfadar of indian bitmenship (bhartiya ballebaaji kaa bhishma pitamah)' bataate hue richards ne kaha ki bharat bhaagyashaalee rahaa he ki usne alag-alag peedi main kai shandaar ballebaaj die
 He said that India has had great batsmen, but if called a role model, Sunil Gavaskar is the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian batting
 iske baad sachin tendulkar aate hai or unke baad viraat kohli hai
 India will be quite happy with these people
 perth test main bhartiya captain viraat or austrailian captain tim pen ke bich hui ladaai ke bare main poochne par richards ne kaha ki bhartiya captain ne line cross nahin kii
 The former West Indies captain said, "I don't think he crossed the boundary"
 mujhe lagata he ki bisisiai ne bhi yahi kaha he or main unki baat ko hi doharaa rahaa hum
 Richards also praised compatriot Brian Lara and said that there is no better batsman than Lara in terms of finding the gap
 richards ne kaha ki aaj ke cricket main, aapako viraat kohli ko dekhnaa hoga or mere ghar ke paas main bryan lara ko
 i don't think any other batsman can do the way Lara used to find the gap
 mere liye yah behad khatarnaak he
 He of course could not hit sixes but used to fill the gap
 sachin bhi yahi karte the
 When asked about the most difficult bowler, Richards said that Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Dennis Lillee came first on this list
 inke alaava bhi kaaphi achche gendbaaj the
 Today is the 92nd birthday of Bharatiya Janata Party founder LK Advani
 pradhanmantri narendra modi, grahamantri amit shah or bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda unke ghar pahunchakar badhai di he
 Once in politics, a couple of atal-advani was speaking and became the biggest center of politics against Congress, the pair formed the first non-congress government in the country and ruled for five years
 lekin bhartiya raajnneeti main adwani kii bhoomika hameshaa mandir andolan ke liye yaad rakhi jaaegi
 Advani is the leader who brought the culture of 'yatras' into politics
 ayodhya main ram mandir kii maang ko lekar laalkrishna adwani ne somnath se lekar ayodhya tak kii rathyatra shuru kii thi jisaki vajah se desh kii raajnneeti main hindutv kii raajnneeti kaa ubhaar hua tha
 However, in Bihar, the then Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav arrested him in Samastipur
 is kadam ne laalkrishna adwani or lalu prasad yadav donon ko hi raajnneeti kaa hero bana diya tha
 LK Advani, who specializes in speaking pure and Sanskrit Hindi, says that he did not know how to speak Hindi for 20 years
 vah aksar yah bhi kehete hai ki jab vah atal ji kaa bhaashan sunate the to hameshaa khud ko lekar kuntha ho jaati thi
 Before the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the BJP, LK Advani was considered the face and he was the candidate for the post of PM
 bijepi ko sangathit karne main bhi adwani kii ahm bhoomika he
 But at the Mumbai session during his tenure as BJP President, LK Advani surprised everyone by declaring Atal Bihari Vajpayee as PM candidate
 kaha jaataa he ki us samay atal bihari vaajapeyi naaraaz hokar adwani se yah bhi kaha tha ki ek baar mujhase puch to lete
 On this, Advani replied to him that as the president of the party it is his right
 bijepi kii sthapana ke kaaphi pehle donon netaa raajnneeti main aa chuke the
 Both started their political careers as RSS pracharaks
 atal ji bhi patrakarita se jude the or laalkrishna adwani bhi
 Atal ji was making a very rapid place in politics on the basis of his speech, while Advani was working as a Sangh pracharak in Kota, Rajasthan
 jansangh ke sansthaapak shyama prasad mukherjee or pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay, atal bihari vaajapeyi ke bhaashanstyli se kaaphi prabhavit the
 Both of them wanted Atal Bihari Vajpayee to reach Parliament somehow so that the people of the entire country could hear his speeches
 lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi kii mulaakaat laalkrishna adwani se kaise hui yah kahani bhi bahut rochak he
 Atal ji was once going to Mumbai by train with Pandit Shyama Prasad Mukherjee as an aide
 mukherjee kashmir ke mudde par puure desh kaa daura kar rahe the
 LK Advani was a campaigner in Kota
 unako pataa laga ki upaadhyaay ji is stesan se guzarane vaale hai to vah milane aa gayi
 At the same time, Mukherjee had met both of them
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal kaa teesraa saal sakht videsh niti kaa daur rahaa
 Rising above the challenges in this phase, the central government made bold decisions, the first two years of the Narendra Modi government looked like a happy ending to happy moments
 jab nai dilli duniya kii teen sabase zyada ahmiyat vaali rajdhaniyon: washington, beijing or islamabad ke saath baatcheet main vyast thi
 One of them was a remote strategic partner and the other two were strategic challenges of the neighborhoods and nightmares for security
 is tarah pradhanmantri modi or raashtrapati baraak obama ke bich abhootpurv 7 baar mulaakaaten huin
 Modi drank and sat on the same swing with Xi Jinping on the banks of the Sabarmati river
 modi ne islamabad main navaj sharif ko gale lagaaya or unki maa se milane rawalwindi main unke paariwarik ghar gaye
 It was a dizzying start, in which India's diplomacy showed renewed vigor and even in the relationship with Pakistan and China, there were immense possibilities
 lekin modi sarkaar kaa teesraa saal kuch myanon main hakeekat kaa ehsaas lekar aayaa
 Now there is tension in the relationship with Pakistan instead of possibilities and with the increasing aggression of China, the relationship is getting worse
 in tanaavon kii kuch vajah to pichley teen saalon main vyaavhaarik or bharat-pratham videsh niti kaa ubhaar he, jo keval ek lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhkar vyapaar, urja or suraksha ke teen stambhon ke peeche chalati he
 In this policy, diplomats are cleverly subjected to blows and give tit-for-tat answers
 isiilie neend main duube 18 hindustani sainikon kii jaan lene vaale ek hamale kaa jawaab puure talmail ke saath seemaa-paar pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main dehshat ke lonchpaidon par ''sargical strike" se diya jaataa he
 Prime Minister Modi, like the previous Indian Prime Ministers, also sets the tone of Indian diplomacy
 magar bharat kii videsh niti kii praathamiktaayen tay karte hue unhone nijee taur par ek ke baad ek vaishvik rajdhaniyon ke safar kii jaisi chaundhiyane vaali rakrataar kaayam kii, vaisaa unke kam hi purvavartiyon ne kiya tha
 Negotiations with Islamabad remain the same as that which came after the January 1, 2016 attack on the Pathankot airbase
 lekin sarkaar ne duusare padosiyon nepal, bangladesh, afghanistan, kvayanmar or srilanka ke saath rishton ko kaaphi aage badhaayaa or pichley november main islamabad main hone vaale dakshes shikhar sammelan kaa bahishkaar karne ke liye in sabhi ko raji kar liya
 This July the visit of Prime Minister Modi to Tel Aviv, which will be the first visit of any Prime Minister after establishing a relationship with Israel 25 years ago
 is yahudee desh ke saath uske najdiki rishton ko aakhirkaar band kothri se nikaalkar khule main le aegi
 With this, India will be among the handful of large countries that have excellent relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel, the three conflicting civilizations of West Asia
 modi kii upakptain sushamaa swaraj kathor kadam uthaane se nahin jhijaktin
 Last year, he had asked to embark on a warship to save an Indian in the Gulf of Aden
 lakshyabhedi videsh niti kaa isse bada pratik kya hoga bhala!piem modi kaa record: 54 videsh yatraayenmai or july ke bich tay saat or yatraaon ko ek saath jodakar puure teen saal main pradhanmantri modi 54 videsh yatraaen kar chuke hai
 While former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made only 80 foreign trips during his 10-year tenure
 vahiin usase pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi ne 1999 se 2004 ke bich mahaj 19 videsh yatraaen kar desh kii videsh niti ko majboot karne kii koshish kii thi
 In Chhattisgarh, preparations are going on all over the state about Akshaya Tritiya, popularly known as 'akti'
 lagbhag 28 varshon baad adbhut sanyog ke saath aa rahi akshay tritiya is baar jyotish kii tithiyon ke pher main funs gai he
 Many astrologers are talking about 12 Akshaya Tritiya on May 13
 kuch jyotishiyon kaa kahana he ki donon din akshay tritiya manaai jaaegi
 Akshaya Tritiya, stuck in the dates, will be celebrated on two days i
e
 12 and 13 May
 akshay tritiya parv par is baar shani 28 saal baad apni ucch raashi main gochar karenge
 According to the pundits, this coincidence will be especially fruitful for the devotees
 bhagwaan parashuram jayanti parv ko lekar bhi panditon kii alag-alag raay he
 That is why some 12 are arguing to celebrate it on 13 May
 ek ore jahaan jyotishi akshay tritiya kii tithi ko lekar uljhe hue hai, vahiin duusari ore akshay tritiya ke liye gudde-guddiyaan bechney vaale bazaar pahunchane lage hai
 Pandit Ajay Sharma, who operates an astrology center in Nayapara, Bemetara, said that on May 12, 10
 18 baje se akshay tritiya kii tithi lagegi tathaa vah duusare din 13 may ko 12
 Will continue till 47 o'clock
 isliye akshay tritiya swayan siddh muhoort donon din puure samay rahegaa
 During this, you will get full benefit of the auspicious work done
 vahiin, purohit manoj dube ne bataaya ki 13 may ko akshay tritiya padegi
 May 12 is the second date of sun rise
 12 may ko bhagwaan parashuram jayanti he
 Tritiya will be on May 13 and Akshaya Tritiya will be held on this day
 is din siddh shubh muhoort main shubh kaary kiye jaaenge
 Confusion seems to be developing among the common people, but astrologers have said that the trend of common people towards this special coincidence coming years later has increased by saying that both days are auspicious
 vishesh sanyog: surya apni ucch raashi messkshay tritiya is baar vishesh sanyogon ke saath aa rahi he
 While on the festival, Sun God will transit in his high zodiac 'aries' and Chandra Dev in his high zodiac 'taurus', while Lord Shani, the God of justice, will also transit in his high zodiac 'libra'
 jyotish shaastra ke anusaar 28 saal baad akshay tritiya par shani dev kaa gochar ho rahaa he
 By this coincidence, devotees will get positive results in every field
 jyotishacharyon ke anusaar is avasar par shani saadhe saati se peedit jataka bhagwaan shani kii vidhivat aradhana, havan-anushthan kar is dosha se chhutkaaraa paa sakenge

 Valentine's Day is on the way
 taiyaariyaan joro par he
 All the lovers have prepared the blueprint for 14 February
 lekin kuch aise log bhi honge jinka dil is saal tutaa hoga wo is din khud ko bada badanaseeb maan baithenge
 Yes, we are talking about lovers whose hearts have just been broken
 jinke pyaar kaa abhi abhi panchnaama hua he
 This Valentine's Day can prove to be very painful for them
 lekin aise main hausala banaae rakhane main hi samajhadaari he
 You cannot change what has happened and you have to move forward to make life better
 chaliye ham aapako bataate hai ki agar aapkaa dil tutaa he to bhi aap is velentine de ko kaise enjoy kar sakate hai
 Avoid being alone, in such cases, old memories follow you very fast
 zyada se zyada koshish kiijie ki aap kabhi akele naa rahen
 If you want to go out with your friends on this day or plan something to keep your attention
 kisi rishtedaar ke yahaan ja sakate hampahale aapkaa zyaadaatar vakt apane pyaar ke saath bitta tha aise main aap shahar main maujuud apane rishtedaaron ko vakt nahin de pate the jisase kai log aapse khafa bhi rahane lage the
 This is the time to convince relatives
 to behatar yahi he ki aap kuch vakt apane rishtedaaron ko den jisase aapkaa man bhi bahal jayega
 Seek mental peace, the mind and mind are very turbulent at such times
 aise main koshish kiijie apane man or dimag ko shant rakhane kii
 Go to a place where you will get peace of mind
 jahaan puraani yaaden aapkaa peechha naa karen
 Wherever you go, you can just give yourself time
 dil todu gane sunanaa band karenamtaur par dekha gaya he ki dil tuutane ke baad zyaadaatar log vaise gane sunne lagate hai jisamen dil tuutane or bevafaayee jaisi baaten hoti hai
 Hey sir 
 
 aisa karne se kuch nahin hoga
 In such a situation, only your time will be wasted
 behatar he us vakt ko aise kaam main lagaaein jisase aapkaa bhala ho sake
 Continue searching for new valentine
 If a valentine left, then what happened? Continue looking for new ones
 jo log peeche chhot gaye unhen rahane dijie
 Thinking that someone else might be waiting for you at the next station
 ye mana ki kisi ke chale jane kii kami ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Memories like waves will always hit your heart, but it is better to cherish those memories
 apane aapako or apane dil ko ek baar phir mauka dijie
 It is good to forget him which you do not appreciate
 jindagi bahut haseen he, ise khulkar mauka dijie
 Inshallah, you will surely find someone who will understand you, will not leave you at some point in life and will add your broken heart back
 wo kehete hai naa ki

 These things are mentioned in him
 saath hi yah bhi ullekh kiya gaya he ki pakistan 'good tebrist' kii shrenee main lakhvi ko bhi rakhata he or uske khilaaf vah koi karrwai nahin karnaa chahta he
 This is the reason that the evidence given by India, whether it is Kasab's statement, David Headley or Abu Jindal's statement, Pakistan did not give any preference to any evidence
 grih mantralay main suraksha maamalon ke ek afasar ne enditivi india ko bataaya, "pakistan kii jo antarrashtiya satr kii isolation (ekantavaas) thi, vah khatm ho gai he

 mana ja rahaa he ki iske baad pakistan ek baar phir bharat se lakhvi ke mumbai hamale main shaamil hone ko lekar or saboot kii maang karegaa
 In this regard, government officials say that there is no need to provide additional evidence about Lakhvi
 lakhvi ke khilaaf behad pakke saboot paak ko saunpe ja chuke hai
 On the basis of these evidences, Lakhvi can be proved guilty in any court of the world
