 He said, Gujarat got out of those dark days and is now on the path of development
 shanti, ekta, samanta or bhaichaare kaa vaataavaran hi gujarat kii pragati main ijapha kar rahaa he
 Modi said, it has been seen in the history of the country that the poison of casteism and communal hysteria never helped anyone
 gujarat is baat ko samaj gaya he
 Rising above such disorders, Gujarat chose the path of development
 Your love has encouraged me to come more close to you

 court ne seshans court ke faisle par ste laga diya he
 Let us tell you, in March 2019, the Sutrapada Sessions Court sentenced Lord Barad to 2 years and 9 months in the case of the 1995 Mineral Theft Case
 seshans court main doshi sabit hone kii vajah se bhagwaan bared kii vidhayaki ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 The judgment of the sessions court was challenged in the High Court by Lord Barad
 sachin tendulkar ko jab sar aachrekar cricket khelnaa sikhaa rahe the tab ek ladkaa sachin se bhi acha cricket kheltaa tha, jise ramakant aachrekar sachin se behatar khilaadi maanate the or use viv richards kahkar bulaate the
 But this boy's brother stuck in his path that his career came to a standstill
 ittefaq kii baat ye he ki is ladke ke bhai kaa naam bhi ajit he or sachin ke bhai ke naam bhi ajit he
 The name of this boy who played with Sachin was Anil Gurava
 anil ab zyaadaatar sharaab ke nashe main rahete hai or mumbai ke nalasopara kii ek chol main gumnami kii jindagi bitaa rahe hai
 Achrekar's first choice was not Sachin, Anil! Missing in the crowd, Anil Gurv was once the first choice of Sachin Tendulkar's Guru Ramakant Achrekar and Sir called him Viv Richards
 aaj anil ko dekhakar shaayad aapako yakeen naa ho, magar anil kii batting dekhne ke liye log apana kaam chhodkar maidan main pahuchate the
 Today the same Anil Gurava is in the darkness of oblivion
 jab sachin ne apane cricket kariyar kii shuruyaat kii, tab wo anil gurv kii tarah cricket khilne kii koshish karte the
 Guru Achrekar himself advised Sachin to watch Anil Guru's game and learn from him
 sachin ne anil ke bat se lagaai thi pehali centuriinternational maichon main shatakon kaa shatak lagane vaale sachin tendulkar bhi anil gurv ke kaayal the
 Sachin used Anil's bat for his first match of the Under 14s
 itnaa hi nahin sachin ne apni jindagi kaa pehla shatak bhi anil ke hi bat se lagaaya tha
 Anil Gurv says, 'sachin Sharma was
 
 i said, take the bat, with that bat he made the first century of life
 'aachrekar ne anil kii maa se kaha tha, anil aapkaa bhavishya badal degaschin ke guru ramakant aachrekar ko puraa vishwaas tha ki anil gurv ek din bada khilaadi banegaa
 This was the reason that Achrekar himself used to take Anil to the ground and sit on his scooter and practice on the net
 anil ne kaha, 've mujhe aaazaad maidan se lekar bengal ground tak le jate the scooter par baitaakar
 Net practice by going there
 sar ne mere liye bahut kiya
 'anil's mother was told by Guru Ramakant that happiness is going to come soon in his life
 khud anil kii maa sumitra gurv ne bataaya ki aachrekar ji kehete the, mataji aap chintaa mat karo, anil aapkaa bhavishya badal degaa
 Brother responsible for career disaster Anil's career was moving fast at that time
 lekin anil kii jindagi main ek aisa mode aayaa, jisane uske cricket kariyar ko hameshaa ke liye khatm kar diya
 According to Anil, his younger brother Ajit had become involved in illegal activities
 isaki vajah se anil kii jaan par khatra mandaraane laga
 The police also started harassing them
 aise main usne maidan main janaa hi chhod diya
 In the night cricket for money, Anil Gurav started playing tennis cricket for money after that
 guru aachrekar ne unhen iske liye kai baar manaa bhi kiya tha
 Anil himself admits that the night cricket played with tennis ball was the biggest mistake of his life
 sharaab pine par sar ne danta thaaaj anil gurv zyaadaatar sharaab ke nashe main dhutt rahete hai
 a few years ago when Guru Ramakant met him, he also scolded Anil for this
 anil ne bataaya ki jab aachrekar sar mili to unhone kaha, ' maine tumhe cricket khelnaa sikhaaya tha, pinaa nahin
 'now they apologize to the Guru
 sachin ne anil ko turant pahchaan liyounil gurv sachin ke kaayal hai
 a few years ago, Anil, along with his cricketer friend Kiran Manjrekar, came to see Sachin at a gymkhana, fearing that Sachin might not recognize him
 police ke bandobast ke chalate anil sachin ke najadik bhi nahin pahuch paae, lekin sachin ne ek najar padate hi anil ko fouran pahchaan liya or unhen apane paas bulaayaa
 Anil Gurav recalls that memory, saying, "on seeing me, Anil said, how many days later?" Come home to meet

 On the 4th of August, the Gujarat High Court began hearing a reconsideration petition filed by Zakia Jafri questioning the 'clean chit' given to former Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and others in connection with the 2002 Ahmedabad riots
 
 2002 main shahar kii gulburg socity main hue dangon main unke pati or purv saansad ehsaan jaafaree samet 68 log maare gaye the
 Today, after 13 years, if Jafri has any hope of justice in this case, it is because of the cooperation of Mumbai human rights activist Teesta Setalvad
 haal hi main tista ke khilaaf hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne sambandhi sibiai ke ek warrant ko boxbe hycourt ne 12 agast ko khaarij kar diya tha
 On 9 July this year, the CBI registered an FIR against Setalvad and her husband Javed Anand on the basis of a complaint by the Ministry of Home Affairs (FCRA Cell)
 isamen is dampati par epasiare ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 According to the CBI, as a director of Sabrang Communications and Publishing Private Limited, both had received a foreign grant of $ 2,90,000 from the Ford Foundation, a non-profit organization in the US, while neither had an FCRA account nor He had taken proper permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs
 sabrang kaa kahana he ki use 5 april, 2004 ko 90,000 dollar or 22 sitambar, 2006 ko 2,00,000 dollar kaa anudaan 'bharat main sampradayikta or jati aadhaarit bhedbhaav ke khilaaf sakriy shodh, web aadhaarit soochna-prasar, sabhy samaaj networkon ke vikaas or media ranneetiyon' ke liye mila tha
 Setalvad and Anand say that agreements and activity reports in this regard have been submitted to CBI, FCRA officials and the Gujarat Police
 ve kahati hai, ''sibiai itane saal baad hamaare parisaron par chapa kyon maar rahi he? aakhir ford foundation se anudaan kii pehali khep 2004 main or duusari 2006 main ai thi
 Sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the CBI had conducted the raids based on a request made by the Home Ministry of Gujarat
 mantralay sitalwar ke anudaanon ke strot kii jaanch karnaa chahta tha
 It seems that after this investigation, it must have been revealed to the government that the Ford Foundation is not registered with it

 The last Arjuna Award in tennis was Somdev Devvarman in 2011
 rohan bopanna jaise khilaadi kaa naam kai baar chayan samiti se aage hi nahin bad paaya, lekin is baar french open main mixd dubles champion banane ke baad rohan bopanna ke liye kamyaabi or shoharat ke darvaaze khulte dikh rahe hai
 Bopanna, who became French Open champion with Gabriella Dabrovsky of Canada last week, is in the headlines
 bopanna ne aaj khel mantri se vijay goyal se mulaaqaat kii to ye sawaal uthne lazimi the ki bopanna ab tak arjuna puraskaar kii res main kaise pichad gaye? Sports Minister Vijay Goel said, "our job is to get talented talented sportspersons to get their rights which they deserve
 bopanna kaa naam (arjuna puraskaar) cameti ke saamne jayega jo tay niyamon ke aadhaar par khilaadi kaa naam chayan karegi
 "bopanna also said," In a few months it will be known whether i will get the sports award or not
 agar milegaa to mere liye fair kii baat hogi
 "significantly, since 1961, only 15 tennis players have been able to receive the Arjuna Award
 ramanathan krishnan (1961), vijay amritraj (1974), liender pes (1990), mahesh bhupati (1995), sania mirza (2004) or somdev devvarman (2011) jaise kuch ahm naamon ke bich bopanna jaise kai khilaadi is list main shaamil nahin ho sake
 Not only this, only two players - Leander Paes (1996–97) and Sania Mirza (2015) - have received the Khel Ratna Award from tennis
 ise lekar vivaad bhi hote rahe hai
 The comments bopanna ne ATP ke 16 kitaab apane naam kiye hai
 But Rohan, who turned pro in 2003, always appeared in the shadow of Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi or Sania Mirza's fame
 is baar phir tennis federation kii ore se unka naam arjuna puraskaar ke liye bheja gaya he
 Rohan Bopanna, 37, a resident of Coorg in Karnataka, took nearly ten years to win his first Grand Slam title
 varsh 2008 main french open ke pehle round se 2017 main champion banane tak kaa safar bopanna ke liye aasaan nahin rahaa
 Clay Court is not the favorite surface of Bopanna, the only Indian player to win a Grand Slam title this year
 lekin unki lagaataar kii gai mehnat akhirkaar rang laai or apane kariyar kii duusari pari main bopanna grand slam kitaab jitkar elite group main shaamil hone main kaamyaab rahe
 Says Bopanna, "this time i went to the clay court with good preparation

 We started well in men's doubles and mixed doubles
 kai toornament saath khilne se hamaari team acchhee ban gai jisaki vajah se dabrovoski ke saath kitaab jeet paaya
 "bopanna says that he has not let age affect his game and he is looking forward to the Grand Slam title even further
 khel mantri vijay goyal ne kaha, "hamaara kaam he ki ham hunarmand pratibhashali khilaadi ko unka haq dilaaein jiske ve haqadaar hai
 Bopanna's name (arjuna Award) will go before the committee which will select the player's name based on the rules set
 " bopanna ne bhi kaha, "kuch maheenon main hi pataa chal jaayegaa ki mujhe khel puraskaar milegaa yaa nahin
 If found, it would be a matter of pride for me
 " gauratlab he ki 1961 lekar ab tak sirf 15 tennis khilaadi hi arjuna puraskaar hasil kar sake hai
 Many players like Bopanna are not included in this list among some important names like Ramanathan Krishnan (1961), Vijay Amritraj (1974), Leander Paes (1990), Mahesh Bhupathi (1995), Sania Mirza (2004) and Somdev Devvarman (2011) Possible yahi nahin tennis se abtak sirf do khilaadiyon- liender pes (1996-97) or sania mirza (2015) ko hi khel ratna puraskaar mil chukaa he
 There have also been disputes over this

 lekin 2003 main pro bane rohan hameshaa liender pes, mahesh bhupati yaa sania mirza kii shoharat ke saaye main hi nazar aae
 This time again his name has been sent for the Arjuna Award from the Tennis Federation

 supreme court ne uttarakhand ke baad ab arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke faisle ko radd kar diya he
 Uttarakhand's decision in terms of President's rule is the first decision in India's judicial and political history that came before the new government was formed
 iske pehle aisa udhaaharan pakistan se hi he jab 1993 main nawaz shareef kii barkhaast sarkaar ko vahaan kii supreme court ne behaal kar diya tha
 In 1994, the SR Bommai decision is cited at the time of every President's rule, but when the decision came many years later, before that someone else had formed a government in Karnataka
 esaaar bommai kii sarkaar 1989 main barkhaast hui thi
 See the irony of history
 jis bommai faisle ko raashtrapati shashan lagane ke liye badnaam ho chuki congress ke liye sabak bataaya jaataa tha, usee faisle ke aadhaar par do maheene ke bheetar congress kii do sarkaron ko raashtrapati shashan se mukti mili he
 Let us start with the story of the imposition of President's rule in Arunachal
 is saal 26 janvari ke din jab aap desh main samvidhan lagu hone ke uplakshya main jashn manaa rahe the, super bazaaron main super discount par saamaan kharid kar apana ghar bhar rahe the, raisina hills par sthit 340 kamaron ke raashtrapati bhawan ke kisi kamare main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee us prastaav par dastakhat kar rahe the jise kendriya mantrimandal ne bheja tha ki arunachal main raashtrapati shashan laga dena chahie
 According to media reports, on the evening of 26 January, the President signed the proposal of the Center as soon as the guests left
 26 janvari ko shaam 7 bajkar 59 minute par press indermeshan beuro kii soochna aati he ki arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya he
 It is said that the cabinet had recommended President's rule in its meeting on 24 January
 26 janvari ke din raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa faisla taarikh ke kaaran bhi khatkana chahie tha, magar kisi ko khatka nahin
 Like Uttarakhand, there was no significant uproar over Arunachal Pradesh
 shaayad isliye bhi ki media bhi raashtrapati shashan lagane ke 100 se adhik udaahranon ke kaaran saamaanya ho chukaa hoga
 This may be the reason that the headlines of President's rule in Arunachal in the newspapers of 27 January were not very big
 pehle panne par thim magar saamaanya khabaron kii tarah
 The matter was to be heard in the Supreme Court on 27 January, but on 26th the President signed the Cabinet proposal
 vipaksh ne ise loktantr kii hatya kaha tha
 Hearing continued in the Supreme Court but a government was also formed in Arunachal Pradesh
 saat maheene baad supreme court ne jo faisla diya he vah ek baar phir se hamaare loktantr main raajnneetik dalon ke dussahason par sawaal uthaata he ki kis tarah partiyaan or unki nishtha ke naam par sansthaaon ke pramukh aaj bhi samvidhan ke saath khilwaad kar le rahe hai jabaki aaj ke samay ko sattar assi ke dashak kii tulana main kahin zyaada jaagruk or chaukas kaha jaataa he
 The Constitution Bench of five judges of the Supreme Court, having given the verdict from Ekarai, restored the seven-month-old Congress government in Arunachal Pradesh
 vahaan is vakt bijepi ke samarthan se sarkaar chal rahi he
 The judges who gave the verdict are Justice JS Khehar, Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice Madan b Lokur, Justice PC Ghosh and Justice NV Ramanna
 uttarakhand maamle ke vakt nainital hoicourt ne kaha tha ki raashtrapati yaa jaj koi raja nahin hai ki unke faisle kii samiksha nahin ho sakati he
 The Modi government's decision to impose President's rule for the second time could not stand in court
 sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki uske iraade hi galat the yaa uske kanoonee salaahkaaron ne galat iraade se suzav die, yaa unki kanoon kii samaj kachi he
 The question is not if the government there has a majority, what will happen to it
 sawaal yah he ki uskaa vajood main aana vaid tha yaa nahin
 The court has said that the current government is illegal
 jin baton ke liye congress kii aalochana hoti thi unheen baton kaa bachaav ab bijepi kar rahi he
 In this case, both are in competition for equal to two
 yani ek jaise hote ja rahe hai
 President's rule is often the subject of academic discussion
 aise maamalon main kisi kii naitikta yaa javabdehi fiks nahin he
 Because of this is equal to vidhayakon kii kya naitikta he
 As you have seen in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, the mlas are being openly accommodated in the Five Star Hotel by filling the bus
 kahin koi sawaal nahin he
 This is the morality of our political parties and this is the level of awareness of you voters
 agar adaalat kii chaukas nigaah na hoti to sochie ki raajnneetik dal loktantr kaa jaap ratate-ratate kaise iskaa galaa ghont dete
 Unknowingly, rightly targeting the BJP, Kapil Sibal has rightly said that only the judiciary can protect the values of the Constitution
 sirf nyaaypalika
 According to the record of political parties, only the judiciary can protect the constitution
 centre main pehali baar bani gaiyr congressi janata sarkaar ne 9 congressi sarkaron ko barkhaast kiya tha
 The Supreme Court has said that it can reverse the needle of the clock
 arunachal pradesh ke maujuuda vidhansabha ke faisle radd kar die gaye hai lekin saat maheene se jo sarkaar avaidh rup se chali rahi he kya use koi sazaa nahin di jaaegi
 Is it so easy that a leader illegally becomes the Chief Minister, spends from the state treasury and resigns and goes home after the Supreme Court order
 kya kanoon kii nazar main avaidh sarkaar kaa mukhyamantri apradhi nahin hona chahie
 Will the Chief Minister or the minister of the illegal government continue to get all the facilities after his removal from office
 kya purv mukhyamantri ke rup main milane vaali tamaam suvidhaayen radd nahin honi chahie
 Justice Khehar said in the judgment that the court cannot remain a silent spectator when political processes are killing
 supreme court ne kaha he ki rajyapal jepi rajkhova ne 14 janvari 2016 kii tay taarikh ke baad bhi 16 disambar 2015 ko vidhansabha kii baithak bulaakar asanvaidhanik kaam kiya tha
 The court also quashed the Governor's message which he had sent to the Assembly on 9 December daily
 kaha ki rajyapal vidhansabha kaa agenda tay nahin kar sakate hai
 Therefore, after 9 December all the decisions of the Legislative Assembly are declared invalid
 9 disambar se pehle kii vidhansabha behaal kii jaati he
 That is, the Congress government comes back into existence
 aamtaur par aise maamalon main jisaki haar hoti he vah yahi kahata he ki faisle kaa sammaan karte hai magar faisla padhane ke baad hi sahi pratikriya denge
 Will appeal jo jeet jate hai, unhen aksar faisle kii kapi padhane kii zarurat nahin hoti
 Equipped with all types of legal advisors, the central government may lose twice in the case of President's rule in the Supreme Court, not be able to defend itself, what do you want to read in that judgment
 yah faisla rajyapalon kii bhoomika ko phir se rekhaankit karata he
 Every time he does, but many times the Governor ruins the constitutional limits and remains comfortable in his office
 rajbhavan kaa sukh bhogate rahete hai
 The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh called the assembly meeting a month before the due date
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki kya iskaa matlab he ki jab bhi rajyapal bor ho jaae to vah utsaah mahasoos karne ke liye vidhansabha kaa satr bula saktaa he
 Was the Governor's decision based on solid constitutional principles or on his whims
 
 
 aap sanvaidhanik vivekadhikaar kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakate hai jab ve kisi sanvaidhanik siddhant par aadhaarit hon
 What constitutional principle was here
 
 
 kya vidhansabha ke satr ko jald bulaanaa aapaki vivekadhin shaktiyon main aata he
 The BJP is calling the verdict bizarre, the Arunachal chief minister says his government will continue, there are reports that the Center will appeal to the court again
 sawaal he ki is faisle kii naitik javaabadari kahaan jaakar rukati he
 Who stops by going to whom
 pradhanmantri ke paas rukati he to raashtrapati kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 His approval has been canceled twice
 court ne kaha he ki rajyapal ko raajnneetik dalon ke jhagade se dur rahanaa chahie
 Recently the Governor of UP has sent a report to the Center on Mathura, Kairana and Dadri
 dilli ke uparajyapal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi raajnneetik vivaad chalata rahata he
 The decision of the Supreme Court can also be seen in these references
 court ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko bheje notice, har mihane bheje jane vaali suchanaaen is aadhaar par sahi tehrai ja sakati thim ki raashtrapati ko rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii jaankaree di ja rahi he
 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha
 The Supreme Court has asked the question whether the rule of law in our country allows the Governor to wind up the constitutional principles and rules of functioning of the Arunachal Assembly
 331 pannon ke is faisle kii har line padhane laayak he
 Although there was no comment on the role of the Governor in Uttarakhand case, but nothing happened to the Governor
 donon hi maamalon main rajyapal bane rahe to supreme court ke is faisle kaa naitik matlab kya rah jaataa he
 It is said in our country that the Constitution itself is supreme for us, but why there is no punishment for its violation
 maamuli bayaan dene or jeb kaat lene par jail kii sazaa hoti he, samvidhan ke ulanghan kii na to naitik zimmedaari na kanoonee sazaa
 President's rule has been imposed more than 100 times
 zyaadaatar maamle main samvidhan kaa ulanghan hua he phir bhi koi raajnneetik dal samvidhan ke ulanghan kii kisi sazaa kii maang nahin karata
 Is it because they know? 
 
 samvidhan se khenlege nahin to raaj kaise karenge
 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 is saal 26 janvari ke din jab aap desh main samvidhan lagu hone ke uplakshya main jashn manaa rahe the, super bazaaron main super discount par saamaan kharid kar apana ghar bhar rahe the, raisina hills par sthit 340 kamaron ke raashtrapati bhawan ke kisi kamare main raashtrapati pranab mukherjee us prastaav par dastakhat kar rahe the jise kendriya mantrimandal ne bheja tha ki arunachal main raashtrapati shashan laga dena chahie

 court ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko bheje notice, har mihane bheje jane vaali suchanaaen is aadhaar par sahi tehrai ja sakati thim ki raashtrapati ko rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii jaankaree di ja rahi he
 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha
 The Supreme Court has asked the question whether the rule of law in our country allows the Governor to wind up the constitutional principles and rules of functioning of the Arunachal Assembly
 331 pannon ke is faisle kii har line padhane laayak he
 Although there was no comment on the role of the Governor in Uttarakhand case, but nothing happened to the Governor
 donon hi maamalon main rajyapal bane rahe to supreme court ke is faisle kaa naitik matlab kya rah jaataa he
 It is said in our country that the Constitution itself is supreme for us, but why there is no punishment for its violation
 maamuli bayaan dene or jeb kaat lene par jail kii sazaa hoti he, samvidhan ke ulanghan kii na to naitik zimmedaari na kanoonee sazaa
 President's rule has been imposed more than 100 times
 zyaadaatar maamle main samvidhan kaa ulanghan hua he phir bhi koi raajnneetik dal samvidhan ke ulanghan kii kisi sazaa kii maang nahin karata
 Is it because they know? 
 
 samvidhan se khenlege nahin to raaj kaise karenge
 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 supreme court main sunwaayee hoti rahi magar arunachal pradesh main sarkaar bhi ban gai
 Seven months later, the Supreme Court has once again questioned the audacity of political parties in our democracy as to how the leaders of the parties and institutions in the name of their loyalty are still messing with the Constitution even today
 Today's time is said to be much more aware and attentive than in the seventies
 supreme court ke paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne ekarey se faisla dete hue arunachal pradesh main saat maheene puraani congress sarkaar ko behaal kar diya he
 The government is currently running with the support of the BJP
 faisla dene vaale jajon ke naam hai justise jees khehar, justise deepak mishra, justise madan bi lokur, justise pisi ghosh or justise envi ramanna
 At the time of the Uttarakhand case, the Nainital High Court had said that there is no king or president that his decision cannot be reviewed
 duusari baar raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa modi sarkaar kaa faisla adaalat main nahin tik sakaa he
 The government should be told that its motives were wrong or that its legal advisors suggested wrong motives, or that their understanding of the law is crude
 sawaal yah nahin he ki vahaan maujuud sarkaar ke paas bahumat he to uskaa kya hoga
 The question is whether it was lawful to exist
 adaalat ne kaha he ki maujuuda sarkaar avaidh he
 The BJP was now defending the same things for which Congress was criticized
 is maamle main donon iz ikval tu kii hode main hai
 That is, they are becoming the same
 raashtrapati shashan aksar academik charchaa kaa vishay banakar rah jaataa he
 In such cases nobody's morality or accountability is fixed
 isi iz ikval tu ke kaaran
 What is the morality of legislators
 aapane haal hi main rajyasabha ke chunaav main dekhi, bas bhar bharkar vidhayak khuleam five star hotel main tehraae ja rahe hai
 There is no question anywhere
 yah hamaare raajnneetik dalon kii naitikta he or yah he aap matadaataaon kii jaagrukta kaa str
 If the court did not have a watchful eye, imagine how the political parties would have strangled it by chanting democracy
 anjaane main hi sahi bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kapil sibbal ne thik hi kaha he ki sirf nyaaypalika samvidhan ke mulyon kii raksha kar sakati he
 Just the judiciary
 raajnneetik dalon kaa jo ricard he uske hisaab se samvidhan kii raksha sirf nyaaypalika kar sakati he
 The first non-congress Janata government at the Center had sacked 9 Congress governments
 supreme court ne kaha he ki vah ghadi kii sui peeche kar sakati he
 The decisions of the current Legislative Assembly of Arunachal Pradesh have been quashed, but the government which has been running illegally for seven months, will not be punished
 kya itnaa aasaan he ki koi netaa avaidh rup se mukhyamantri ban jaae, rajya ke khajaane se kharch kar de or supreme court ke aadesh ke baad istipha dekar ghar chalaa jaae
 Should not the Chief Minister of the illegal government be a criminal in the eyes of the law
 kya avaidh sarkaar ke mukhyamantri yaa mantri ko pad se hatane ke baad tamaam suvidhaayen milti rahengi
 Should not all the facilities available as former Chief Minister be canceled
 justise khehar ne faisle main kaha ki jab raajnneetik prakriyaaon kii hatya ho rahi ho to court mook darshak bana nahin rah saktaa
 The Supreme Court has said that Governor JP Rajkhowa had acted unconstitutional by calling the assembly meeting on 16 December 2015 even after the due date of 14 January 2016
 adaalat ne rajyapal ke us sandesh ko bhi radd kar diya jo unhone 9 disambar ke rose vidhansabha ko bheja tha
 Said that the Governor cannot decide the agenda of the Assembly
 isliye 9 disambar ke baad vidhansabha ke tamaam faisle avaidh ghoshit ho jate hai
 The Legislative Assembly is restored before 9 December
 yani congress sarkaar waapas apane vajood main aati he
 Usually, in such cases the person who loses says that he respects the verdict but only after reading the verdict will give the right response
 apil karenge
 Those who win do not often have to read a copy of the verdict
 tamaam tarah ke kanoonee salaahkaaron se las centre sarkaar do do baar raashtrapati shashan ke maamle main supreme court main haar jaae, apana bachaav na kar paae, aap us faisle main kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 This decision again underlines the role of governors
 har baar karata he magar kai baar rajyapal sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kii dhajjiyaan uda dete hai or apane pad par aaraam se bane rahete hai
 They enjoy the pleasure of the royal palace
 arunachal pradesh ke rajyapal ne vidhansabha kii baithak tay taarikh se ek maheenaa pehle bula lee thi
 To this, the Supreme Court said whether this meant that whenever the governor was bored, he could call a session of the assembly to feel enthusiastic
 kya rajyapal kaa faisla thos sanvaidhanik siddhanton par aadhaarit tha yaa phir unki sanak par
 
 
 You can use constitutional discretion only if they are based on a constitutional principle
 yahaan kya sanvaidhanik siddhant tha
 
 
 Is it in your discretionary powers to call the assembly session soon? bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution
 kya isliye ki ve jaanate hai
 
 
 If we will play with the constitution, how will we rule? yah he samvidhan se chalane vaale bharat desh main samvidhan ke ulanghan kii sanvaidhanik sthiti

 arunachal pradesh ke maujuuda vidhansabha ke faisle radd kar die gaye hai lekin saat maheene se jo sarkaar avaidh rup se chali rahi he kya use koi sazaa nahin di jaaegi
 Is it so easy that a leader illegally becomes the Chief Minister, spends from the state treasury and resigns and goes home after the Supreme Court order
 kya kanoon kii nazar main avaidh sarkaar kaa mukhyamantri apradhi nahin hona chahie
 Will the Chief Minister or the minister of the illegal government continue to get all the facilities after his removal from office
 kya purv mukhyamantri ke rup main milane vaali tamaam suvidhaayen radd nahin honi chahie
 Justice Khehar said in the judgment that the court cannot remain a silent spectator when political processes are killing
 supreme court ne kaha he ki rajyapal jepi rajkhova ne 14 janvari 2016 kii tay taarikh ke baad bhi 16 disambar 2015 ko vidhansabha kii baithak bulaakar asanvaidhanik kaam kiya tha
 The court also quashed the Governor's message which he had sent to the Assembly on 9 December daily
 kaha ki rajyapal vidhansabha kaa agenda tay nahin kar sakate hai
 Therefore, after 9 December all the decisions of the Legislative Assembly are declared invalid
 9 disambar se pehle kii vidhansabha behaal kii jaati he
 That is, the Congress government comes back into existence
 aamtaur par aise maamalon main jisaki haar hoti he vah yahi kahata he ki faisle kaa sammaan karte hai magar faisla padhane ke baad hi sahi pratikriya denge
 Will appeal jo jeet jate hai, unhen aksar faisle kii kapi padhane kii zarurat nahin hoti
 Equipped with all types of legal advisors, the central government may lose twice in the case of President's rule in the Supreme Court, not be able to defend itself, what do you want to read in that judgment
 yah faisla rajyapalon kii bhoomika ko phir se rekhaankit karata he
 Every time he does, but many times the Governor ruins the constitutional limits and remains comfortable in his office
 rajbhavan kaa sukh bhogate rahete hai
 The Governor of Arunachal Pradesh called the assembly meeting a month before the due date
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki kya iskaa matlab he ki jab bhi rajyapal bor ho jaae to vah utsaah mahasoos karne ke liye vidhansabha kaa satr bula saktaa he
 Was the Governor's decision based on solid constitutional principles or on his whims
 
 
 aap sanvaidhanik vivekadhikaar kaa istemaal tabhi kar sakate hai jab ve kisi sanvaidhanik siddhant par aadhaarit hon
 What constitutional principle was here
 
 
 kya vidhansabha ke satr ko jald bulaanaa aapaki vivekadhin shaktiyon main aata he
 The BJP is calling the verdict bizarre, the Arunachal chief minister says his government will continue, there are reports that the Center will appeal to the court again
 sawaal he ki is faisle kii naitik javaabadari kahaan jaakar rukati he
 Who stops by going to whom
 pradhanmantri ke paas rukati he to raashtrapati kii bhoomika par sawaal kyon nahin ho rahe hai
 His approval has been canceled twice
 court ne kaha he ki rajyapal ko raajnneetik dalon ke jhagade se dur rahanaa chahie
 Recently the Governor of UP has sent a report to the Center on Mathura, Kairana and Dadri
 dilli ke uparajyapal kii bhoomika ko lekar bhi raajnneetik vivaad chalata rahata he
 The decision of the Supreme Court can also be seen in these references
 court ne kaha he ki raashtrapati ko bheje notice, har mihane bheje jane vaali suchanaaen is aadhaar par sahi tehrai ja sakati thim ki raashtrapati ko rajya kii raajnneetik sthiti kii jaankaree di ja rahi he
 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha
 The Supreme Court has asked the question whether the rule of law in our country allows the Governor to wind up the constitutional principles and rules of functioning of the Arunachal Assembly
 331 pannon ke is faisle kii har line padhane laayak he
 Although there was no comment on the role of the Governor in Uttarakhand case, but nothing happened to the Governor
 donon hi maamalon main rajyapal bane rahe to supreme court ke is faisle kaa naitik matlab kya rah jaataa he
 It is said in our country that the Constitution itself is supreme for us, but why there is no punishment for its violation
 maamuli bayaan dene or jeb kaat lene par jail kii sazaa hoti he, samvidhan ke ulanghan kii na to naitik zimmedaari na kanoonee sazaa
 President's rule has been imposed more than 100 times
 zyaadaatar maamle main samvidhan kaa ulanghan hua he phir bhi koi raajnneetik dal samvidhan ke ulanghan kii kisi sazaa kii maang nahin karata
 Is it because they know? 
 
 samvidhan se khenlege nahin to raaj kaise karenge
 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 supreme court ne kaha he ki rajyapal jepi rajkhova ne 14 janvari 2016 kii tay taarikh ke baad bhi 16 disambar 2015 ko vidhansabha kii baithak bulaakar asanvaidhanik kaam kiya tha

 But it is out of the Governor's authority to use his constitutional position to try to resolve these political disputes
 tippaniyan In this case the Governor never said that Chief Minister Nabam Tuki had lost the confidence of the House
 na hi yah bataaya ki congress ne vidhansabha main bahumat kho diya he
 If that were the case, the Governor could have ordered a majority on the floor of the House
 magar rajyapal ne khud hi bataaya he ki unhone kabhi vishwaas mat pareekshan ke liye nahin kaha

 This is the constitutional position of violation of the constitution in the Constitution-driven India
 aamtaur par aise maamalon main jisaki haar hoti he vah yahi kahata he ki faisle kaa sammaan karte hai magar faisla padhane ke baad hi sahi pratikriya denge
 Will appeal jo jeet jate hai, unhen aksar faisle kii kapi padhane kii zarurat nahin hoti
 Equipped with all types of legal advisors, the central government may lose twice in the case of President's rule in the Supreme Court, not be able to defend itself, what do you want to read in that judgment
 yah faisla rajyapalon kii bhoomika ko phir se rekhaankit karata he
 Every time he does, but many times the Governor ruins the constitutional limits and remains comfortable in his office

 bijepi faisle ko vicitra bataa rahi he, arunachal ke mukhyamantri kehete hai ki unki sarkaar bani rahegi, khabaren hai ki centre court se phir apil karegaa
 The question is where does the moral accountability of this decision stop
 kiske paas jaakar rukati he
 If he stops with the Prime Minister then why is there no questioning the role of the President
 do-do baar unki manzuri radd hui he
 The court has said that the governor should stay away from the quarrels of political parties
 haal hi main upi ke rajyapal ne mathura, kairana or dadri par centre ko report bheji he
 Political controversy also continues regarding the role of Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 supreme court kaa faisla in sandarbhon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The court has said that the notices sent to the President, the information sent every month could be justified on the basis that the President was being informed about the political situation of the state
 lekin yah rajyapal ke adhikaar se baahar he ki vah apni sanvaidhanik sthiti kaa istemaal karte hue in raajnneetik vivaadon ko sulajhane kii koshish kare
 The comments is maamle main rajyapal ne kabhi nahin kaha ki mukhyamantri nabam tuki ne sadan kaa vishwaas kho diya he
 Nor did it state that the Congress lost a majority in the Assembly
 agar aisa hota to rajyapal sadan ke patal par bahumat hasil karne ke aadesh de sakate the
 But the governor himself has said that he never asked for a trust vote
 supreme court ne sawaal poocha he ki kya hamaare desh main kanoon kaa shashan rajyapal ko sanvaidhanik siddhanton or arunachal vidhansabha ke kaamkaaj ke niyamon ko hawa main udaane kii ijazat detaa he
 Every line of this judgment of 331 pages is worth reading
 vaise uttarakhand maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika par kam tippanee nahin hui thi magar rajyapal kaa kuch nahin hua
 In both the cases, if the Governor remains, then what is the moral meaning of this decision of the Supreme Court
 hamaare desh main rataya jaataa he ki samvidhan hi hamaare liye sarvocch he magar iske ulanghan par koi sazaa kyon nahin he
 Making minor statements and cutting pockets carries a jail sentence, neither moral responsibility nor legal punishment for violation of the constitution
 100 se adhik baar raashtrapati shashan laga he
 In most of the cases the constitution has been violated, yet no political party demands any punishment for violation of the constitution

 Rejecting her complaint, accusations of being part of a pre-poll political conspiracy, a woman journalist who was allegedly sexually harassed by Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal, said that what Tejpal did to her falls within the legal definition of rape
 
 police kii poochtacha kaa saamana karne ke liye tejpal ke goa ravaanaa hone se pehle apane bayaan main mahila patrkaar ne kaha ki pichley ek pakhwaade se chaaron ore se mil rahe samarthan se uskaa manobal badha he
 In a two-page statement, he has said, however, i am deeply concerned and deeply hurt by the objections that my complaint is a part of the pre-election political conspiracy
 aise akshepon ko spasht taur par khaarij karte hue unhone kaha he ki tejpal ne jo kiya, vah dushkarm he
 While Tejpal is struggling to save his wealth, wealth and special benefits, the fight for me is for his honor and his right that my body is mine and not the toy of my employer
 mahila patrkaar ne kaha ki aarope darj karakar maine na sirf apni us naukari ko ganvaai, jise main pasand karti thi, balki behad jaruri vittiya suraksha or tankhwaah ko bhi ganvaa diya
 Not only this, i also invited personal and offensive attacks against me
 mahila patrkaar ne kaha ki is sabase dardanaak anubhav kaa sabase kathin hissaa kuch chizon se jujhna he
 i do not know if i am ready to see myself as a 'rape victim' in the eyes of my colleagues, friends, supporters and critics
 mahila patrkaar ne kaha, peedit aparaadh ko shreneebaddh nahin karata he
 
 
 This law does
 or is maamle main kanoon spasht he
 
 
 What Mr
 Tejpal did to me falls within the legal definition of rape
 unhone kaha, main spasht taur par is tarah ke aaropon ko khaarij karti hum or in daleelon ko saamne rakhti hum
 
 
 The struggle of women for rights over their lives and their lives is definitely a political battle
 
 
 lekin mahilavaadi raajnneeti or unki chintaaen hamaare raajnneetik dalon kii sankeern soch se vyapak he
 He said, therefore, i call upon my political parties to renounce the greed to convert an important debate about gender, power and violence into a dialogue about themselves
 unhone in aaropon se inkaar kiya ki vah kisi kii shah par kaam kar rahi hai
 He said, such allegations that i am acting on the behest of someone, is a morale breaker
 unhone kaha, pichley saptaah, behatar tareeke se jaanane vaale televijan camentataron ne mistar tejpal dwaara meraa yon utpeedan kiye jane ke vakt or uske baad, mere iraadon or mere kadamon par sawaal uthaaya

 In the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, BSP MP Shafiqur Rahman Burke has given an excuse that has sparked controversy over the insult of Vande Mataram
 unhone kaha ki islam ke khilaaf havende maataramisaliye vah loksabhaa chhodkar chale gaye the
 The BSP MP said, 'it is against our religion, so if such a situation comes in future also, i will do what i have done today
 jahaan tak desh kii aan-baan kii baat he to main iske liye apni jaan bhi qurbaan karne ko taiyaar hum

 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko bajet satr kii kaarywahi anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit kiye jane se pehle bispi saansad raashtragit vande maataram kaa vakout karke chale gaye
 Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar had strongly objected to this and instructed the BSP MP not to do so again in future
 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko 12 baje dobaaraa sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hui to hangaamaa shuru ho gaya tha
 Meanwhile, Meira Kumar put the necessary documents on the table of the House and requested the members shouting slogans near the Speaker's seat to go to their seats
 sadan main shor sharaaba rukne par unhone sadasyon se raashtragit ke liye khadey hone ko kaha
 As soon as the tune of the national anthem started, BSP mps left the House

 Our victory will be absolute and lasting, authentic
 unhone kaha ki haryana main ham sarkaar main hai
 Dushyantji has clearly stated that he does not believe in Congressism and its policies
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki jharkhand main aisa kuch nahin hone vaala he or yahaan bhaajapa ko spasht or purna bahumat milegaa or ham sthir sarkaar kaa gathan karenge
 He said that as far as Maharashtra was concerned, our Yuti (coalition) had an absolute majority in Maharashtra
 jo yah sarkaar bani he, mandet (janadesh) ko churaayaa gaya he
 He said that Shiv Sena has actually won the election by riding on the back of BJP
 prasad ne bhaajapa ke mantri rahe or ab baagi hokar mukhyamantri ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe sarayu raay ke bare main kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya

 The meeting was also attended by Supreme Court Chief Justice HL Dattu and Congress Parliamentary Party leader Mallikarjun Kharge
 is tarah pehali baar lokapal kanoon ke tahat sibiai pramukh kii niyukti hui he
 Anil Sinha was earlier posted to the post of special director in the CBI itself
 bihar cader ke ipies afasar sinha ne pichley saal may main sibiai ke special diarector kaa pad sambhala tha
 Anil Sinha was the Additional Secretary in the Central Vigilance Commission before joining the CBI
 sinha ne isse pehle apane state cader main visilence or anti karpshan, administration, special branch or anya vibhaagon main kaam kiya he
 He has also served as DIG and IG in SPG
 manovigyaan main post graduate anil sinha ko 2000 main police medal or 2006 main raashtrapati kaa police padak mil chukaa he
 a man is accused of having an innocent child living in his own neighborhood
 yah vaardaat gujarat ke navsari jile ke amalsad gaanv kii he
 This incident of brutally killing the accused on the banks of the pond is heartbreaking
 mangal sukha halapati naam kaa shaks ek bacchee ke sathbalaatkaarake iljaam se ghir kar bheed ke hathe chadh gaya
 Before the police would arrest him, a case would be taken against him, he would be held guilty in the court of justice, the mob even convicted him and sentenced him to death as per his own rules and regulations
 darasal mangal sukha par aarope tha ki usne sharaab ke nashe main pados main rahane vaali 2 saal kii ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kiya
 Hearing the cry of the innocent girl, the women who reached the spot started beating Mangal after seeing the condition of nebchi
 mahilaon kii maar se bachane ke liye aaropee gaanv ke talab me kud gaya lekin tab tak vahaan par puraa gaanv ikkatha ho chukaa tha
 After this, people took Mangal Sukha out of the pond and beaten it down
 bheed ne aaropee par lathi-danda or laat-ghunson samet tamaam hathiyaaron se hamalaa kiya
 On seeing it, he fell down and fell on the ground
 logon kaa gussa phir bhi kam nahin hua or wo use peetate rahe lekin kisi ne bhi use bachaane kii koshish nahin kii
 The whole village kept watching this spectacle of death
 maukey par pahunchi police nearopeeco bheed se bachaakar navsari civil aspataal pahunchaaya jahaan doctoron ne jaanch ke baad use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 The question is the same: can anyone be punished publicly by beating them publicly? This has rarely happened before in the history of independent India, when a mob was killed by a mob by expelling them from jail
 lekin nagaland ke dimapur main aisa bhi hua tha
 Here in the charge of rape, a person was not only beaten up and beaten by the mob, but also hanged him in the public square
 jab isse bhi ji nahin bharaa to phir use jinda jala diya
 Whatever happened on 5 March in Dimapur city of Nagaland, which is situated on the north eastern part of the country
 usne in sawaalon par achaanak hi puure desh ko maathapai karne par majaboor kar diya
 The students of Nagaland gave such a strange and terrible death to a person arrested in the rape charges, that if this scene had been seen by ISIS and Taliban militants, perhaps they too would have had the confidence that in the world living such a confessional thinking, the same Are not alone
 darasal, dimapur ke second hand car dealer syed farid khan ko police ne 25 farvari ko ek naga student ke saath lagaataar kai dinon tak rape karne ke iljaam main giraftaar kiya tha
 Before the police could present any evidence against him, the witnesses would speak, the court would punish him
 gussaye naujavaanon ne khud apane haathon se use barbar sajaa de di
 Angry about the rape incident, about 10,000 students and youth attacked the District Jail in Dimapur directly and broke the two gates of the jail one by one and entered inside
 phir kya tha, mutthi par jail karmi kone main khadey ho kar sara tamaasha dekhte rahe or hajaaron logon kii bheed ne is mulgim ko sabake saamne agava kar liya
 In order to punish this culprit for his alleged crime, the mob beat him and dragged him to the plaza of Dimapur
 tab tak uske tamaam kapade fat chuke the or phir use bilkul nagn haalat main rassiyon se baandh kar sadakon par ghasita jaataa rahaa
 During this time, a group of beheaded youth kept capturing every aspect of this terrible scene on camera
 jab vozulmon-sitamake is silsile se guzar kar bilkul besudh ho gaya use ek fande ke sahare dimapur chowk par taang diya gaya
 He was eventually burnt alive in the same condition
 sabase phikr kii baat yah rahi ki bheed is taadaad or unki is soch ke aage tamaam kaayade-kanoon, police, suraksha intjaam sab chote pad gaye
 The policemen, who tried to stop these boys, also had to go out of the way in a bloody manner
 jab sab kuch shant ho gaya, to dimapur prashasan ne pehle karfu or dhara 144 lagane kaa elaan kiya
 According to sources, Syed Farid Khan was a Bangladeshi citizen

 The court ordered Tiwari Kadinsampal test for this, for which he had to give this sample after doing enough nanukur
 tiwari kiujwala sharmaase pehali mulaakaat aaj se kareeb 50 saal pehle hui thi
 She was in her late thirties when she first met Tiwari in 1968 when she was in her father's house 3, Krishna Menon Marg, in 1968
 us vakt tiwari yuva congress ke adhyaksh the
 Ujjwala's father Prof

 As she says, 'there was not much harmony between me and Sharma ji (husband BL Sharma) so we decided to separate
 ' jab ve tiwari se milin tab dilli vivi main sanskrit padhaati thim
 This delicate young girl came into the eyes of Tiwari
 apni nigaah ko dridhtaa se farsh ke kaaleen par jamaaye hue ujjwala yaad karti hai, 'dhire-dhire hamaara parichay badha or unke pranay nivedan shuru ho gaye

 The case came to light in 2008 when Rohit went to court for the first time against ND Tiwari, claiming he was the son of former Congress leader and his mother Ujjwala Sharma
 tiwari nedillihoicortmenis cese ko khaarij karne kii guhaar court main lagaai lekin march, 2010 main use khaarij kar diya gaya

 He pleaded in the Supreme Court too, from where he got frustrated

 The special thing is that when Tiwari shied away from giving DNA test, Rohit's legal father BL Sharma agreed to give his DNA sample in 2010
 jabaki sharma se ujdgawala pehle hi talaak le chuki thim
 Test results proved that he is not Rohit's father

 tab unhone kaha, ‘maine sweekaar kar liya he ki rohit shekhar meraa betaa he
 DNA reports have also proved that he is my biological son
 ’ is par unke bete rohit ne bhi pratikriya di, ‘main achambhit hum ki endi tiwari ne antat mujhe apana betaa sweekaar liya he
 'married at the age of 88, but it is also noted that he considered Rohit as his son when the High Court's request for arbitration was rejected
 saath hi rohit kii maa ujjwala sharma ne bhi is maamle main madhyasthata kii guzarish ko yah kehete hue nakaar diya tha ki yah unki property se judaa maamla nahin balki keval itnaa he ki rohit unka betaa he
 Ujjwala Sharma said, 'DNA report had proved that he is Rohit's father
 wo tabhi is par bich kaa rasta nikaal sakate the lekin wo court chale gaye
 'ND Tiwari married Rohit's mother Ujjwala in Lucknow on May 14, 2014, within 2 years of receiving the DNA report

 During the UP Investor Summit in February this year, 80 businessmen of the country made more than 1000 mous and promised that they would invest 4 lakh crores in the state
 ab july main inamen se kuch kaarobaariyon ne ek baar fidd manshaa jaahir kii he ki vah rajya main 60,000 karod lekar aa rahe hai
 Questions are arising that if the state is so suitable for investment, then why is the annual GDP figure of the country not showing this investment?

 In this sequence, the Central Government has taken steps for successive economic reforms, including infrastructure development, FDI reforms, ease of doing business including insolvency and bankruptcy codes
 iske saath hi kendra sarkaar ne puure desh ko ekikrut market main tabdeel karne ke liye july 2017 main jiesti lagu kiya jisase nijee kshetra se nivesh ko badhaayaa ja sake
 Despite these steps, almost all economic experts claim on the recent GDP figures that the main reason for the failure of this flagship scheme of the central government is the lack of activeness of the private sector

 jahaan 2007 main nivesh anupaat 38 fisadi tha vah 2016-17 ke dauraan ye ludhakkar 30 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 Although there was an improvement in the capital formation situation in the country after the global financial crisis (which led to a bounce in the stock market), the investment situation continued to deteriorate and the economic situation remained weak for 7-8 per cent growth through investment

 Apart from this, along with the decline in private investment in the agriculture sector, there was a decline in investment in real estate during this period, due to which the problem of creation of new employment in the country was seen

 On 2 September 2009, the then Chief Minister of United Andhra Pradesh and Congress leader Y
 es
 After Rajasekhara Reddy's (YSR) death in a chopper accident, his son Jaganmohan claimed the chief minister's post as the successor
 ve mukhyamantri nivas ko khaali karne se inkaar karte hue teen maheene tak apane parivaar ke saath vahiin bane rahe, kyonki party main rassakashi jari thi
 But the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi refused him
 kuch logon ke suzav ke baavjood sonia gandhi ne jagan (unka lokapriy naam) ko rajya party pramukh ke taur par bhi tavajjo nahin di
 Angered Jagan left the party and formed his new party Yuvjan Shramik Raitu Congress (YSRC)
 ab 10 saal baad kahani puri tarah gum gai he—andhra pradesh main congress jahaan aundhe munh giri, vahiin jagan ke sitare buland hai
 Jagan has followed his father YSR as chief minister (2004–2009), following the strategy of following his strategy to make his presence felt among the general public
 ek na ek kalyankari yojana ke jariye rajya bhar main garib or vanchit virgon ke pariwaron tak pahunchakar viesar ne ek dayaalu netaa ke rup main lokapriy chhavi banaai thi
 During his public relations programs, Jagan repeatedly gave the same slogan that he would develop the state like 'rajana Rajyam (rajasekhara's reign)'
 2004 main apane pita ke rajyabar main kiye daure kii tarj par jagan ne 2018-19 main 341 dinon main record 3,648 kilometre kii yatra (praja sankalp yatra) kii or is dauraan unhone kareeb ek karod logon se mulaakaat kii
 During this time, he also kept appearing in the CBI special court every Friday in Hyderabad where he is facing dozens of financial matters and they include corporates, his friends and bureaucrats
 lekin ant bhala to sab bhala
 The YSRC has eliminated opposition by securing 22 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats and 151 seats in 175 assembly seats
 vishakhapatnam ke centre for policy studies ke sansthaapak adhyaksh e
 Prasanna Kumar says, "chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu was a media observer and Jagan was an easy victim
 par doordaraj ilaakon tak garibon ke paas praja sankalp yatra ke jariye pahunchakar jagan ne logon par apana jaadu bikher diya
 He emerged as the leader who fascinated the people
 tidipi ke bure shashan ko khatm karne ke liye haath jodakar 'sirf ek mauka maangate' jagan kii prarthana logon ke dil tak utar ai
 
 
 People still remember the welfare steps of YSR
 ''jagan ne apane campan ke liye kuch peshewar madad bhi lee thi
 After losing by a narrow margin to Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the 2014 elections, he tasked the Indian Political Action Committee (i-pack) of Prashant Kishore, who formulated an election strategy, to carry out his own campaign of personality
 
 shuruaati dinon main 'jagan anna vastunnadu' jaise aakarshak naare ke baad, phir 'ninnu nammam babu (ham aap par bharosa nahin karte hai)' jaise naare se naidu par par hallaa bolaa gaya or 'nenu vunnanu, nenu vinnanu (main yahaan hum or main aapaki baat sun rahaa hum)' se logon ke dil main jagah banaai gai or phir 'rawaali jagan, kevali jagan (hamen jagan chahie, jagan ko jeetna chahie)' jaise naaron se matadaataaon kii ummiido ko hawa di gai
 The campaign of the i-pack included the 'jagan Anna Pilupu' campaign, in which about 60,000 people were elected at the village level who had a major influence on the villagers
 chunaav karte samay unki uplabdhiyon par gaur kiya gaya tha
 Those were sent personal letters signed by Jagan himself, along with giving a number of his office, directing them to share inputs for the development of their region and state
 jagan ne logon ke man main kaise apni shashakt chhavi banaai, is baat ko bataate hue aai-pack ke asabaah siddiki kehete hai, ''hamane rajya bhar main baithken yojit kin, jahaan logon ko jagan se sidhe baatcheet karne kaa mauka diya gaya
 In the later stages of the campaign, Jagan's sister Sharmila Reddy embarked on an 11-day bus tour aimed at spreading Jagan's message firmly among the public
 reliyon main ve logon se puuchhatin, ''praja thirapu kwali (logon kaa faisla kya he)
 "it was a huge public outcry," Bye Bye, Babu (popular name of Chandrababu Naidu)
 '' abhiyaan ke aakhir main march main naidu ko bataane ke liye ki rajya main ab unka samay khatm ho chalaa, sabhi 175 nirvachan kshetron main ulti ginati vaale timer lagaae gaye the
 These timers were also prominently placed on party websites to remain in the discussion on social media
 sooyeeboojh or doordarshita ke saath gadhe gaye is abhiyaan ne dhamal machaa diya
 In the electoral history of Telugu states, no leader sitting on the peak of popularity had ever won such a victory in terms of number of votes and percentage of seats
 2019 main andhra pradesh main har doosraa matadaata (49
 9 percent vote) was a supporter of YSRC
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki tidipi kii ore se bade paimaane par kiye gaye sahaayta or vikaas kaaryakramon ke baavjood janata ne satta virdohi rujhaan dikhaaya
 Explaining the defeat, some party members argue that actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan's Jan Sena may have spoiled Naidu's game
 jan sena ne vidhansabha seat to sirf ek jiti par usne 6
 7 percent of the votes were captured, while the TDP received 39
 1 pratishat mat mili
 Knowing that the TDP had to be content with 23 mlas, Jagan tightened up, "god has written a beautiful screenplay by punishing Chandrababu
" '' unhone kaha ki tidipi pramukh ne 2014 ke chunaavon ke baad viesarsi ke 23 vidhayakon ko kharid liya tha or sanyog ki is saal kii 23 may ko unke paas bas vahi 23 sankhya haath lagi he
 This defeat is very disappointing for Naidu
 unhone narendra modi ke netritv vaali sarkaar ko chunauti dene ke liye ek rashtriya vikalp taiyaar karne kaa sapana sanjoya tha or iske liye deshbhar main anya partiyon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Naidu's strategy of breaking ties with the NDA also did not succeed after the bjp-led NDA refused to grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh
 naidu kii purv media salaahkaar paarkala prabhakar kahati hai, ''naidu sarkaar kii ore se gathit real-time gavarnence socity (artijies) sareekhee doshapurn feedback maikenism ne unhen sahi suchanaaen nahin deen
 They often fell into the imaginary bubble of the 85 percent index of marked happiness
 ÓÓ ve kahati hai, ''sarkari yojanaon kaa nishpadit na hona bhi ek bada kaaran rahaa

 Interest is outstanding
 lihaaja naidu kii vaapasi mushkil he
 The age of 69-year-old Naidu is also not supporting him and he has also failed to build a mid-level leadership in the party
 yah unke bete naaraa lokesh (jo mangalagiri vidhansabha seat se apana pehla sidhaa chunaav haar gaye) ke liye ek badi chunauti he
 The TDP chief's credibility is at the lowest level today, especially after his failed visits to form an opposition front
 bhaajapa congress or tidipi ke netaaon ko pehle se hi aakarshith kar rahi he or tidipi ko dharashayi karne kaa maidan taiyaar kar chuki he
 Just like Congress has been replaced by YSRC
 jagan ke liye yah ubhartee chunauti he
 They are already skeptical about the Modi government agreeing on special state status
 vaise unhone mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath grahan se pehle rajya kii is daavedaari ko pesh karne ke liye pradhanmantri se baatcheet kii
 But now that the BJP does not need external support in Parliament, they will not get a chance to place any condition before the BJP to achieve special status
 unke jujharu swabhaav ko dekhte hue jagan ko mukhyamantri pad par kabiz hone ke baad bhi naidu ko chunauti dete rahanaa hoga
 Jagan has announced an inquiry into allotments and contracts made for the multi-purpose Polavaram project, land acquisition and allocations in the new capital Amaravati and government land in the port city of Visakhapatnam
 isse naidu ke kaarykaal kaa bhrashtachar beparda hoga, vahiin rajya ke bade mudde barkaraar rahenge
 Jayaprakash Narayan, a former administrative officer and chairman of public power, says, "andhra Pradesh is in financial trouble and we need the help of the Center
 2014 main sansad main rajya ke punargathan dauraan jo vaade kiye gaye the, jagan apni vakpatutaa kaa istemaal karke un phaaydon ko hasil karne main safal ho sakate hai
 The state is in a difficult phase, the YSRC and TDP should work towards the development of the state by forgetting the mutual hatred
 '' unka maananaa he ki nai rajya sarkaar 80,000 karod ru
 It should try to get the money that the Center has to provide under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act
 narayan maanate hai ki centre tex main riyaayaten nahin degaa, par andhra ko karj maaf karne or rajya ke rajasav ko badhaane ke liye vishesh bond ko manjuuri dene main madad kar saktaa he
 Jagan is looking into this issue and has sought one year time from the public to make Andhra the best state in the country
 ek kaarobaari ke taur par apni shuruyaat karte hue jiskaa commercial graph 2004 main viesar ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad teji se badha tha, jagan ne cement kaarobaar, buniyadi dhaanche or media sahit kai kaarobaar main haath aajamaaya
 In 2009, he became MP for the first time
 unka kahana he ki vahiin unke jivan ko sahi disha mili
 After being elected leader of the Legislative Party, overwhelmed Jagan said, "in 2019, people have trusted us and voted for us
" 2024 main ve hamaare pradarshan ke aadhaar par or bada janadesh denge
 We will develop Andhra Pradesh as a model state that it will become an example across the country
 '' unhone apane chunavi vaade ke anuroop yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki 2024 tak sharaab kii bikri paanch sitara hotalon or paryatakon tak hi simit kar di jaaegi

 After demonetisation and GST, the government does not want to give taxpayers (personal, professional, businessman) a chance to hide anything
 is "soochna ugalvaao'' abhiyaan kaa namoona he vitt varsh 2017-18 ke iskar ritern form
 The government has tried to hit many targets with one stone by obtaining financial information of taxpayers through income tax returns
 taxchori rokane, kaale dhan par lagaam lagane or benami sampatti par roak ke liye sarkaar ko karadaataaon kaa puraa vittiya diene chahie
 However, it is difficult to say how much strength the inspectors will get from this

 Sahaj and ITR (4) i

 On the other hand, ITR 4, ie the facilitation form, is meant for those traders who consider their annual turnover as income and pay a fixed tax on it
 is saal naukareepesha logon ko inakam tex ritern bharte samay apni selary kaa brallep dena hoga
 You have to tell about such allowances which are not tax free

 pagaar ke alaava achal sampatti yani jameen-jaaydaad se hone vaali aay kii bhi vistrut jaankaree dene kaa praavdhaan sahaj form main he
 Details of total rent received from the property, local taxes paid on the property, amount of interest paid on the loan taken on the property, etc
 will have to be given
 yah niyam pichley saal hi lagu ho gaya tha ki 50,000 rupye se zyada kaa masik kiraaya hone par, kirayedar tex kaatane ke baad (tids) hi makaan maalik ko kiraye kaa bhugtan karegaa

 It is not that the government cannot get any information of any firm or businessman right now, but after filing GST number in the income tax return, the complete record of business will be opened only through PAN
 ek form ke paas kai pan number ek badi musiibat hai
 GST is a unique number and the PAN number entered by the taxpayer in the return will be considered correct
 isliye kisi form ke paas se adhik pan card hone kii sambhaavna bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 Paper companies set up to infuse black money are also targeted
 pan number ke bina kisi company kii pahchaan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Companies can fall into the tax net as soon as they come with PAN and GST number

 This information will be the biggest weapon during the raid, ie if the taxpayer gets more than the property declared in the return, then the income tax people are waiting for him

 haalanki jain bahut utsahit nahin hai
 He says that he has seen such changes many times in the last 25 years of practice, but the government has not been able to do any major work through this data

 piem modi ne party sadasyon ko yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki ab rajyasabha main amit shah rahenge or aise main party sadasyon ko bhi niyamit taur par sadan main upasthit rahanaa hoga
 This was the first meeting of the party parliamentary party chaired by Shah after he was elected as a Rajya Sabha member
 piem modi ne kaha ki vipaksh main rahete hue ek party ko chalaanaa aasaan hota he, lekin satta main rahane ke dauraan yah kahin kathin hota he
 PM Modi said that it is easy to run a party while in opposition, but it is much harder when in power
 rajya ke ek iees adhikari us samay kuch zyada hi batooni ho gaye jab unhen baithak main yojana ayog ke adhikariyon se rubaru hone kaa mauka mila
 He started talking about the development of Bihar
 unke bhaashan ke minute bhar baad himukhyamantri nitish kumaarane unki baat ko badi hi vinamrata se bich main hi kaat diya ''yahaan in baton kii charchaa kii jarurat nahin he
 "he is new in the department and does not know much," said Nitish while taking command
 jamini hakeekat kuch or hi he
 Bihar is facing severe drought
 '' kamare main baithe logon tak unka sandesh pahunch gaya
 The motive was not to celebrate the story of Bihar's success but to show the need for funds
 agle do ghante tak yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ke saath chali baithak main mukhyamantri ke saath maujuud sachivon ko bolne kamauka kam hi mila or lagbhag sari baatcheet mukhyamantri ne khud hi kii-unhone spasht rup se bataaya ki unhen or kosh kii jarurat kyon he
 Nitish's presentation was full of facts and figures; He detailed policy initiatives and deadlines with ease and clarity but in a dim voice compared to others present in the boardroom, yet was successful in asserting his request and reliably
 15 farvari ko nai dilli main hui baithak ke lagbhag turant baad ahaluwalia ne bihar kii vaarshik yojana main 20 fisadi kii vruddhi karte hue ise 24,000 karod ru

 november 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jabardast jeet darj karke lagaataar duusari baar satta main laute nitish lagata he, apane pehle kaarykaal main nazarandaaj kii gai baat-agar unhen apane vaadon par khara utarana he to unhen afasarshahon main bhi khud jaise soch kaa sanchaar karnaa hoga-kaa mahatv bakhubi samaj gaye hai
 Previously, Nitish used to tolerate those who were lagging behind in implementing policies
 unke pehlekarykaal main afasarshahon ke khilaaf khub shikaayatein ai thim
 In the second term, he decided that enough was enough
 isi maheene main nitish ne afasarshahon ke liye samay seemaa tay karne ke vaaste kai ghoshnaaen kin
 For example: Now the babus have been asked to dispose of the file in three days, otherwise they will have to face punishment
 nai vyavastha 25 april se prabhavi ho gai he or yah sabhi sarkari karmchaariyon-offis assistant se lekar vibhaag pramukh tak-par lagu hogi
 Similarly, department heads have been warned not to keep government officials on the waiting list without deployment
 nitish ko unke nae kadamon ne hi rashtriya str par ek adarsh bana diya he
 On April 4, the Union Ministry of Personnel ordered that all IAS officers and other officers of the Group Service 'central Service' should make public their annual property returns - a move apparently inspired by Bihar's move in February Was
 lekin, yah pehla mauka nahin he jab baaki desh ne nitishaki pahal kaa anukaran kiya
 The central government's decision to introduce 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayats and other urban bodies was taken after Bihar set an example in this context
 soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) kanoon ke aavedakon ke liye kol centre or vishesh sahaayak police kaa gathan unke kuch anya faisle hai, jinhen doharaaya gaya he
 There has been a big change in roads, education and health sector in Bihar
 mahilaon ke liye unke sakaaratmak kadam or mahadalit kendrit nitiyon sareekhe saamaajik prayaason ke nattejey bhi saamne aae hai
 All this has added to his stature, but Nitish is not going to be easily satisfied
 apane maujuuda kaarykaal main nitish saaf taur par apni galatiyon se sabak lete najar aate hai
 Just two years ago in February 2009, in a public meeting, he had asked the officers from the stage to give their mobile numbers to everyone so that the common man can have direct access to the top officials of the government
 iskaa ulataa hi nateezadekhane ko mila, tatkaaleen mukhya sachiv aar

 The ringing of the phone call of the officers like Pillai was not going to stop - some people were calling him at 4 am to see if they even responded
 phone numberon ke saath hi is kadam par jald hi pani daal diya gaya
 Instead, they enacted the Right to Service Act which would provide service to the people within the time limit
 nitish kaa javabdeh prashasan kaa vichaar ab bhi nahin badla he, lekin ab unke tareeke adhik yathartwaadee or kam shabdadambarpurn ho gaye hai
 Clearly, Nitish Kumar is preferring reality over symbolism
 unka yah badlaav dhimaa lekin prabhavi he
 As a politician, they cannot stop working according to the wishes of the people, but they have clearly understood that nothing is going to happen just by speaking
 shashan ko sanvaarane ke liye anginat vichaaron kii aamad ke saath hi, unhen yah bhi pataa he ki un par amal kis tarah hoga
 "nitish has more knowledge about departments than his secretaries," says a senior IAS officer
 power point prajentation ke bich main, ve aapse kah sakate hai ki pichhali slide par jaaen or unke sawaalon kaa jawaab den
 They also know which joint secretary should call Delhi for the pending project
 or to or, ve bahut tej dimag hai or aap unhen jhansaa nahin de sakate
 "this makes it clear why the Chief Minister appears somewhat unhappy in his second term
 ve shaayad isliye baichaiyn hai kyonki unke sabhi vichaaron ko abhi tak jamini str par yojanaon main tabdeel nahin kiya gaya he
 The Chief Minister has already registered many good works in his name
 sthaneey hnetra vikaas kosh (local aria deveopment fundaledy) ko samaapt kar vidhaayi barbaadi par ankush lagane se lekar seva kaa adhikaar kanoon pesh karne tathaa sabhi sarkari adhikariyon or mantriyon kii parisampattiyon ko saarvajanik karne ke kadam ke saath hi nitish ne rashtriya manch kii ore rukh karne kii ummid se pehle apana ghar durust karne kaa kaam shuru kar diyaahai
 Nitish Kumar's biggest problem has been a long list of negative things which despite his achievements, are trying to push Bihar back
 udhaaharan ke liye, beshak rajya ne 200405 se 201011 main 10
 It has registered a growth of 93 per cent, one of the highest growth rates in the country, yet it has the lowest per capita income, as well as its 54
 4 fisadi jansankhya garibi rekha se neeche rahati he
 Similarly, in the last five years, 57,341 criminals have been convicted due to speedy trial in Bihar, but many of them have secured bail; Probably this is why the rate of crime and cognitive crimes is still increasing
 ek baar phir, nivesh bad rahaa he lekin bihar ko bijli kii 45 fisadi kami kii maar bhi jhelni pad rahi he
 No matter how much he is trying, Nitish is seen by many as "something done" as the Chief Minister - this adjective brought victory for him last year but could not bring the feeling of completeness
 behtareen koshishon ke baad bhi nitish kumaar ne jo vaade kiye or jin par amal kiya usamen ab bhi bada antar maujuud he
 But his patience has started breaking down, it became clear during a public meeting last month when he expressed anger at the bureaucratic obstinacy
 naaraazgi kaa saarvajanik rup se pradarshan vinamr nitish ke liye puri tarah apratyaashit he or sthapit parampara ke khilaaf bhi
 Political and bureaucrats continue to curse each other privately, but it is considered a silent agreement between them that they will never reveal these things publicly
 mukhyamantri kii jhallahat un adhikariyon ke prati unki hataasha kaa sanket he jo ''unke soch ke saath kadam se kadam milakar nahin chal paa rahe hai
 "nitish Kumar says that he sleeps several nights with the worry that a welfare scheme has gone to red tape - brings out a new aspect of him
" aisa isliye kyonki ateet main nitish kumaar ko party kaaryakartaaon se zyada afasarshahon par zyada yakinrakhane vaala mana jaataa rahaa he
 But now they seem fully ready to tighten the nail too
 ve jaanate hai ki der hona kai baar andher hone jaisaa hota he
 Overall, Nitish Kumar's team has done well
 bihar sadak nirmaan vibhaag ke sachiv pratyay amrit akele iees adhikari hai jinhen vaiyaktik shrenee main lok prashasan main pradhanmantri vishistataa puraskaar se nawaja gaya he
 His achievement can be seen in association with the renaissance of Bihar
 sirf afasarshah hi nitish ke safai abhiyaan kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Rural Affairs Minister Bhim Singh also received a befitting reply when he was trying to move from the "people's court" in the name of a party program
 unase kaha gaya, ''apni seat par hi baithe rahen or darbar khatm hone tak seat par hi rahen
 Another minister was pulled out when a woman legislator accused him of favoring an engineer during a meeting of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 nitish kumaar jaanate hai ki jab tak vyavastha safasuthari nahin hogi ve acha pradarshan nahin kar sakenge
 They want both the MLA and the bureaucrat to execute their views
 nitish yahaan se kahaan ja sakate hai? aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki bihar to unki bhavishya kii yojanaon ke liye prayog kaa sthaan he
 Despite his ties with the BJP, his secular image is maintained, due to which the NDA can use his image to attract more parties in the next Lok Sabha elections
 lekin yah asaamaanya jaldbaaji kyon? 60 varsh kii umr main nitish jaanate hai ki unke aage badhane ke liye yahi sahi samay he
 Apart from this, it is due to his high rating that many believe that he is also the biggest challenge in the path of revival of Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 More than the Modi government patted its back on demonetisation, it is now worrying that the elections in five states should not be a victim of public displeasure
 sarkaar ab lagaatar safai detii najar aa rahi he
 This was clearly reflected in the budget of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 vitt mantri jetali kaa shuruaati bajtiy sambodhan notebandi par hi kendrit rahaa
 He mentioned demonetisation dozens of times in his budget speech

 Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav held a joint press conference for the first time
 donon media ke saamne aise najar aae jaise puraani gahari dosti ho
 Gave each other bouquets, hugged each other, defended each other over questions at the press conference
 saath hi aise sawaalon ko taal bhi diya, jisase unki dosti, gathbandhan par asar pade
 rahul-akhilesh's first press conference question-and-answer-27 years UP Behala had 13 years of SP rule in it, are you (rahul) upholding that slogan? Rahul's answer - a few years ago Congress Party workers conference was held in Lucknow 
 us dauraan maine kaha tha ki akhilesh achche hai, par unhen kaam nahin karne diya
 Question- Will you project Rahul for PM in 2019? akhilesh kaa jawaab-aapako jaldibaji nahin hone chahie
 Akhilesh evaded questions in a way
 sawaal- rahul akhilesh kii sarkaar ko kya reating? or akhilesh manmohan kii sarkaar ke bare main kya kahenge?akhilesh kaa jawaab- ham aane vaale paanch saal kii baat kar rahe hai
 Both will run well together
 rahul kaa jawaab- ek sawaal aapane poocha tha jiskaa jawaab nahin mila
 Performance of Akhilesh
 ek baat main akhilesh ke bare main kahata hum ki intension inkaa sahi thi, koshish puri kii
 We want to support that intension
 unki bhaavana upi ko badalane kii thi, usko ham saport kar rahe hai
 The same thing is in our heart
 kuch kamiyaan rah gayi, lekin ve paas hai
 Who initiated the alliance? Who will fight with Rae bareli-amethi? Akhilesh's answer- If you tell everything today, how will the issue of writing remain? Rahul's answer- This is not a central issue
 ye sawaal nahin he ki raibareli-amethi par congress kitne siton par ladegi
 We are going to change UP, this alliance is for that
 bataa den ki raibareli-amethi main 10 vidhansabha siten hai
 Question- Why was Mayawati not given a place in the coalition? Akhilesh's answer- How did Mayawati get a place in the alliance
 unako bahut jagah lagati he
 His election symbol is the elephant
 main or rahul unhen jagah nahin de sakate the
 Question- Will Priyanka Gandhi campaign? Rahul's answer- Priyanka is my help, she helps me and will continue to do it
 wo congress kii asset hai 
 Priyanka will take a decision regarding campaigning in the election
 sawaal- mayawati or bijepi ko lekar aapkaa kya kahana he?rahul kaa jawaab- main mayawati ji kii izzat karata hum
 i also respect Kansi Ram, he made mistakes but i respect him
 mayawati or bijepi main bahut bada fark he
 BJP spreads anger, spreads anger, their ideology threatens India
 mayawati kii vichaardhaara se desh ko koi khatra nahin he
 Do not compare these two
 rahul ne kaha-ganga-yamuna ke milan se niklegi progress kii saraswatirahul ne kaha ki dil se aap sabakaa swaagat he
 The first word in the word Uttar Pradesh is the answer, this is our partnership, Akhilesh and Mary, Samajwadi and Congress and the people of UP, this is an answer
 itihaas main upi ne jawaab diya he
 In 1857, the force stood here during the Company Raj and responded
 virodh, gusse, baantne or company ko hindustan kaa dhan dene kii raajnneeti kaa jawaab de rahe hai
 Ganges and Yamuna are meeting, the Saraswati of Progress will emerge
 akhilesh bole- main or rahul cycle ke do pahinkhilesh ne kaha ki ham congress ke saath centre main bhi saath rahe hai
 This is the alliance of development, the alliance of the people
 janata chaahati he ki gathbandhan ho
 There will be faster work with Congress
 gathbandhan ko 300 se zyada siten milegin
 People's trust will increase and they will take the people of UP along
 ham or rahul cycle ke do pahie hai
 Opponents are questioning the brotherhood
 aaj shuruyaat he
 The central government has put people in line

 Earlier it was believed that there was a delay from the Congress side, now the congress-shiv Sena felt that Sharad Pawar delayed the formation of the Shiv sena-bjp alliance in Maharashtra
 is
 rajya main sarkaar kaa gathan na hone kaa dosha congress ke maathe madha ja rahaa tha
 But now both the Shiv Sena and the Congress are suspecting that it is Sharad Pawar who is delaying the entire process of bringing the Congress and Shiv Sena together
 puure ghatnakram main ek aakasmik pragati tab hui jab achaanak shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne mumbai main congress netaaon ke saath do baithken kin
 Ahmed Patel met Sharad Pawar and other NCP leaders on Tuesday evening
 iske baad mangalvaar ko der raat uddhav thakare ke saath ahamed patel kii pehali baithak hui
 Then on Wednesday afternoon, Uddhav met Congress leaders like Ashok Chavan, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat and Manikrao Thackeray
 yah meeting tab yojit kii gai jab shivasena or congress ke netaaon ko laga ki sharad pavaar is maamle ko latakaane kii ranneeti apana rahe hai
 On Tuesday, everyone was waiting for Congress leaders Ahmed Patel, KC Venugopal and Mallikarjun Kharge to find an accurate route by discussing with NCP leaders
 lekin achaanak rajyapal kii ore se raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish karne or centre kii ore se cabinet meeting bula lene se log awak rah gaye
 Even the Shiv Sena and the Congress were stunned as the NCP quietly sent a letter to the Governor asking for 48-hour deferment, without taking him into confidence and on the basis of this letter, the Governor sent his recommendation to the Center
 iske kuch hi ghante baad rajyapal kii ore se ensipi ko di gai samaysima samaapt ho rahi thi
 The Governor sent his recommendations on the basis of ncp's letter, it was neither known to Shiv Sena nor to Congress
 rajyapal ko patr bhejne kii timming se bhi shivasena or congress ke man main andeh utpann hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to leave for Brazil on Tuesday night and a cabinet meeting was scheduled to take place in the afternoon
 shivasena or congress ko andeh he ki kaise usee samay ensipi kaa patr governor ke paas pahunchaa or unhone grahamantralay ko raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish bhej di
 By then, Sharad Pawar was acting to form a grand alliance between NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress
 yahaan tak ki ve media or shivasena ko yah bhi bataa chuke the ki congress vichaardhaara kii vajah se gathbandhan kaa faisla lene main der kar rahi he
 But in contrast, on Monday, when the Shiv Sena went to the Governor's House to extend the deadline for the formation of the government, the Congress had prepared its letter of support in Mumbai and Delhi was waiting for the seal of the high command, where the meeting of Congress leaders on the same issue was going on Was living sonia gandhi ne aage badhane se pehle sharad pavaar se phone par baat kii to sharad pavaar ne unhen intjaar karne ko kaha
 He told Sonia Gandhi, 'nothing has been decided yet
 ’ iske baad sonia gandhi ne pradesh congress ke netaaon ko hadabadi machaane ke liye daant lagaai or shivasena governor house se khaali haath waapas aa gai
 But now when Sharad Pawar agreed that the rest of the talks to form the government will be held in Delhi during the Parliament session, Shiv Sena and Congress leaders decided to meet and negotiate
