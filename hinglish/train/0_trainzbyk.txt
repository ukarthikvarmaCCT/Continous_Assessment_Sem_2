 In the film, the two conflicts run parallel
 is film kaa treetment bhi rich he
 The film has a big canvas, tightness in screenplay and script, a sharp edge in dialogs and a taste for all the actors

 Khairampur, village, Sitapurdo - rumors had been flying for four days
 par kutton ne kisi par hamalaa nahin kiya tha
 But on Thursday, May 17, suddenly a girl was attacked again in Khairampur village and later she died in the hospital
 kutton kaa aatank phir se fail chukaa tha
 Most of the villages in Machanasitapur, built for monitoring, have a similar view nowadays
 kutto ke khauf ne gaanv ke gaanv logon ke rahan, sahan, unki routine or khaas taur par bacchon kii mouj-masti tak chin lee he
 To protect even in the fields of the village, a place is now being built on the high scaffolding instead of the ground

 Before May 17, 13 children have fallen prey to unknown man-eating dogs

 In the initial days, even after the indiscriminate encounter of the dogs, when the death of the children did not stop, the police also felt the need for intensive investigation of the case

 According to the administration of the Forest Department and the deployment of the police force, the number of dogs attacking children is around 50

 Are the dogs attacked or some other animal? However, the police administration has been in Sitapur for almost two months
 is dauraan kareeb 50 se zyada kutton kaa maar bhi diya gaya
 While many dogs were caught and sent the other way
 magarbacchon par hamaleka silsilaa nahin tham rahaa
 Now the administration believes that the danger may be a bit subdued after the school is discharged from May 19
 kyonki bachche tab baahar nahin niklenge
 But is this the way to get rid of terror from dogs? kya bacchon par hamalaa karne vaale ilaake ke hi kute hai
 Or is there another animal in the attacking dog family? Where do dogs come from among us? Now the question is from where do these dogs come from to create difficulty in our social fabric? to isaki sabase ahm vajah kooda he
 Most dogs litter around the garbage, because they get food from there

 17 saal pehle nokia ne 3310 launch kiya tha or aisa kaha ja saktaa he company ne taabut se nikalakar ek baar phir se 3310 launch kar diya he
 In 2000, the company's most popular phone 3310 was launched
 yah saal 2017 he or aapke saamne phir se Nokia 3310 kaa nayaa avatar he
 Nokia may have launched three Android smartphones, but Nokia 3310 is being the most discussed worldwide
 isaki vajah aapako pataa he
 People are reliving their old memories from this and the company is also cashing it in well
 haalanki yah dekhne main puri tarah se puraane Nokia 3310 jaisaa nahin dikhataa, lekin agar in donon ko compair karen to kya miltaa he
 Let's have a look
 Nokia 3310 Vs Nokia 3310 dizin17 saal ho gaye to jaahir he dizin main badlaav kiya gaya he
 It has already been diluted and slightly larger
 iske corner karvd hai jise acchhee grip banati he, haalanki yah pehle jaisaa tagada or majboot nahin dikhataa
 Because when the trolls of 3310 are made, it is said that this phone falls, Cho comes cracked in the ground, not in the phone
 samaj gaye honge aap
 The former 3310 was in two colors, but it comes in 4 colors
 iske batan pehle jaise hi push vaale hai or body plastic kii bani he
 Nokia 3310 Vs The Nokia 3310 display display has changed drastically
 pehle vaale main 1
 There was a 5-inch monochrome display, but 2 in it
 4 inch kii disple hajise ab suraj kii raushnee main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 It obviously has a color display and its screen is curved so that the grip is good
 Nokia 3310 Vs Nokia 3310 camera17 saal pehle kisi feechar phone main camera hona kalpanaaon main bhi nahin tha
 But now the time has changed and the new Nokia 3310 also has a 2 megapixel camera with LED flash
 haalanki ise aap camera phone kii tarah jaj karne kii galati nahin hi kar sakate hai
 Nokia 3310 Vs Nokia 3310 Battery 17 years ago, the company had only 2 in Nokia 3310
 5 ghante tocktime vaali bydaree di thi, lekin is baar 22 ghante kii tocktime vaali bydaree lagi he
 Then the standby time was 55 hours, but now the standby time is for a month
 bydaree byaap ke liye puraane Nokia 3310 ko janaa jaataa tha or shaayad ab bhi usee ke liye janaa jayega
 That is, it can run for a week without charging
 patali yaa moti pin charger kii jhanjhat nahin ab aam micro yuasabi se hi charge kar sakate hai
 Nokia 3310 Vs Nokia 3310 Snake Game, ie Snake gamesnake Game, not to be missed, was a specialty snake game of Nokia's feature phone
 puraane Nokia 3310 main bhi tha or nae vaale main bhi he
 But this time it is colorful
 ise gemeloft ne dizin kiya he, lekin is game main puraane vaale sneke game kii feel nahin najar aati he
 Nokia 3310 Vs Nokia 3310 Price: It was very high in 2000, because there were no cheap phones like it now
 haalanki tab bhi isaki keemat us samay ke hisaab se kam thi
 The company launched it at 49 euros (about Rs 3,500)
 or tab ise 128 british pound main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Now it will be interesting to see if it is as popular as before
 chalange kai hai, kyonki bazaar main ab pehle se zyada handset hai or isse behatar fitures ke saath hi hai
 Will Nokia's nostalgia enable it to haul from a floor? Would you like to buy it? Tell us in the comments

 How does the loan lending model work? The latest report by ICRA and BCG (boston Consulting Group) shows how well our regulators and government are living: • Between 2014 and 2017, banks' share in total debt declined from 49% 28 per cent, while the share of nbfcs increased from 21 per cent to 44 per cent

 But why did you change your image in Hindi films? He loved to see me acting naturally in Tamil films
 lekin hindi filmon main log kaaphi glamer or masala chaahate hai
 i had the misfortune that my first Hindi big hit film was from commercial cinema (himmatwala)
 maine sadma main kairactor role kiya to film flop ho gai
 So people started signing me for just the glamorous role
 lekin ek din main sabko yah dikhaakar rahuungi ki main acchhee acting bhi kar sakati hum
 Will that day come soon? Yes, a lot has changed now
 mujhe yah samaj main aa gaya he ki glamer mahatvapurn he, lekin ashleelata nahin

 Do you think you will remain number one for a long time? i cannot remain number one for a lifetime
 ladakiyon ke liye to yah samay or kam hota he
 It is difficult to perform well year after year

 Whenever someone young comes from me, i will leave movies

 i like to stay at home with my parents
 main bahut sharmili hum or logon se ghulne-milane main kathinaayee mahasoos karti hum
 Does your stardom have any effect in life? Because of this stardom i do not get a chance to see life properly
 main sari yaa kuch or khareednaa chaahati hum to yah mushkil aati he
 i do not go shopping
 lekin ab main isaki abhyast ho gai hum
 Have your characters influenced your lifestyle? The characters i have played in films are completely different from my personal life
 in charitron ko nibhaane ke turant baad inhen bhul jaati hum
 You are quite simple in personal life, but the camera looks totally different? Because i am very professional
 main kisi shot ke liye pehle se koi taiyaari nahin karti
 i have not learned acting, i think it happens in you

 Police sources said that Rudy's personal assistant filed a complaint with the Delhi Police yesterday when the MP saw his fake profile created by an unknown person on Facebook
 shikaayat ke maddenjar dilli police kii aarthik aparaadh shakha (iodblyoo) ne soochna praudyogiki adhinium kii praasangik dhaaraon or hamshakl banane ko lekar agyaat vyakti ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 Delhi Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said that the case has been registered and the EOW is investigating the case
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham us hamashakt ko dhundne or uski pahchaan karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 "rudy said," i am taking it very seriously
 kisi vyakti ne mere naam par fasebuk acant taiyaar kiya he
 i informed the Commissioner of Police (YS Dadwal) about it and i am very upset with it
 ’’ us jaali acount par rudi ke nijee sahaayak anil khosla ne sandesh bheja jisamen kaha gaya he ki yah bhaajapa netaa kaa acount nahin he or koi ‘‘jaalsaaj iskaa sanchaalan kar rahaa he or iskaa durupyog kar rahaa he

 desh kii rajdhani dilli main badhate pradooshan par kaabo paane ke liye car formule par CM kejariwal kaa rukh ab naram dikh rahaa he
 a day after the decision on the new proposal, CM Kejriwal said that if the Odd and Even number plate formula causes the problem then this system will not be implemented
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is faisle ko ek baar lagu kiya jaae or nateeja dekhne ke baad aage faisla kiya jayega
 The number plate will run on vehicles
 After the High Court directed the government to control pollution, the Kejriwal government on Friday decided that cars with OD and Even numbers will run in Delhi from January 1
 haalanki, isfaisle kii vyavhaarikta par tamaam sawalkhade hue
 After this, the statement of CM Kejriwal has come that the problematic decision will not be implemented
 
 @sardesairajdeepi agree
 But something urgent needed to be done in view of emergency situation
 Lets assess after trying for a few days — Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) to be implemented from December 1, 2015 January 1 According to the decision of the government, cars will not be able to run daily on the streets of Delhi from January 1
 dilli kii sadakon par number plate ke mutabik hi car chal paaegi
 Kejriwal government of Delhi has taken a big decision to curb the rising pollution
 1 janvari se dilli main license plate bain hoga
 That is, the aud and even number plate formula will be applicable in Delhi
 iske mutabik ek din sadakon par even yani sam number vaali gaadiyaan chalengi 
 
 
 
 to duusare din 
 
 
 Only odd numbered vehicles
 kya he matlab?sam number plate se matlab he
 
 
 Last digit of vehicle number
 
 
 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 
 
 
 While the meaning of odd number
 
 
 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9 he
 The Delhi government believes that this formula will reduce the number of vehicles on Delhi's roads
 
 
 or pradooshan ke str main baari giravat dekhne ko milegi
 Decision after High Court rebuke: This decision of the Kejriwal government has come after the High Court's rebuke
 hoicourt ne tippanee kii thi ki dilli main pradooshan kaa str itnaa khatarnaak he ki yahaan rahanaa gas chembar main rahane jaisaa ho gaya he
 After this comment of the court, Delhi government suddenly woke up from sleep
 aanan-fanan main arvind kejariwal ne apaat baithak bulaai or pradooshan rokane ke liye dhadadhad kai faisle le daale
 The Delhi government prepared an action plan to stop pollution
 ye he dilli main pradooshan rokane kaa formula1 janvari se dilli main number plate ke aadhaar par gaadiyaan chalengi
 One day even numbered vehicles will run in the state and odd number vehicles will run on other days
 shahar main trakon ke pravesh kaa vakt raat ke nau baje se badhaakar 11 baje kiya jaayegaa
 The Pollution Under Control Certificate for trucks and vehicles outside Delhi will be checked at the border
 2017 se dilli main euro 6 vaahan va euro 6 eendhan kaa hi prayog kiya jaayegaa
 All thermal power plants in Delhi will be closed
 sarkaar neshnal green tribunel ko dadri plant band karne kii arji degi
 The help of local bodies will be taken to control pollution caused by burning of garbage and leaves
 vipaksh kaa hamalahalanki, dilli sarkaar ne hawa main ghulti betahasha jehar par kaabo karne ke liye kaagaj par yojana to bana lee
 
 
 but 
 
 The real test of the Kejriwal government will be to implement it
 kejariwal sarkaar ke prastaav par vipakshi dalon ne tikhi pratikriya jaahir kii he
 If the Congress has declared it as anti-people, then the BJP has described the steps taken without any plans
 kya he dilli sarkaar kaa faisladilli sarkaar ne rajdhani se pradooshan kam karne ke liye faisla kiya he ki ek din sam jaise 0,2,4,6,8 ke ant vaale number kii gaadiyaan chalengi
 Then, the next day, odd-numbered numbers of 1,3,5,7,9 will run
 isse dilli kii sadakon par gadiyon kii sankhya ghatakar sidhe aadhi rah jaaegi
 This rule will come into effect from January 1
 isamen viipi numberon or apaat sevaaon vaali gadiyon ko chhot di gai he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also calling a meeting of ministers and concerned officials on 8 December
 kisne kya kaha?bijepi pravaktaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki isse apana kaam karne vaale logon, doctoron, vakeelon ko samasya hogi, jinhen jaldi pahunchane ke liye nijee car kii jarurat hoti he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed said that the decision of the Kejriwal government is to gain cheap popularity
 is faisle se aam aadmi ko pareshaani hi hogi
 Chetan Bhagat also protested, the author Chetan Bhagat has also opposed this decision of the Kejriwal government
 unhone ise bina soche samajhe uthaaya sakht, aloktantric, lagu na kiye ja sakane vaala or ajeeb kadam bataaya he
 Also said that this is not a real solution to this problem
 Draconian, undemocratic, not implementable, not a real solution, bizarre
 Odd even cars kind of posturing politics should be avoided
 Please— Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat)december 5, 2015chetan bhagat ne samaadhaan bhi sujhayachetan bhagat ne agle twit main kaha he ki dilli ke pradooshan kaa asal samaadhaan chote shaharon main sudhaar, utsarjan kaa acha kanoon or saarvajanik parivahan kii behtareen vyavastha he
 Real solution to Delhi pollution is to improve smaller cities
 Lower pressure on supermetros
 Good emission norms, great public transport
 — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat)december 5, 2015sunita narayanan ne kiya samarthanaparyavarnavid sunita narayanan ne dilli sarkaar ke is kadam kaa samarthan kiya he
 He said that pollution in Delhi has reached a very harmful level for health
 yah apaat sthiti he or dilli kii aabo-hawa ko thik banaae rakhane ke liye aise kadamon kii sakht jarurat he
 The High Court has also said that living in Delhi is like living in a gas chamber
 china ne apanaai thi pehle vyavasthaayh vyavastha sienji se chalane vaali bason, texiyon or auto rickshaw par lagu nahin hogi, lekin yah baahar se dilli main pravesh karne vaale vaahanon par bhi lagu hogi
 Such a system was implemented in 2013 in Beijing, the capital of China
 yah faisla dilli main panjikrut kareeb 90 lakh vaahanon par lagu hoga
 Every day about one and a half thousand new vehicles are registered in the city
 ashutosh bole- ye to ek prayog haichautarafa ho rahi aalochana ke bich aap netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki yah to ek prayog he jo pehali janvari se 15 dinon ke liye kiya jayega
 Depending on the experiment, the government will try for 15 days to see if it succeeds
 sabase bada sawaal- lagu kaise hogaphilhal dilli ke aage sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki yah faisla lagu kaise hoga
 The biggest challenge will be coordination with various agencies
 ise lagu karne kaa jimmaa dilli police par hoga, jo centre ke adheen he or bijepi pehle hi iskaa virodh kar rahi he
 Some people say that making this rule and enforcing it will be more of a voluntary process

 ) bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bharat jaise mulk main cashles arthvyavastha kisi bhi keemat par sambhav nahin he
 Talking about cashless economy in India is beyond his comprehension
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki desh main cashles arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke liye chaahe kitna bhi prachaar kyon nahin kar liya jaae, desh main puri tarah se cashles arthvyavastha katai sambhav nahin he
 No country in the world was completely cashless, while talking to journalists after attending a public dialogue program in Patna, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that it is not that there is no cashless transaction in today's date, in the country already before the ban Cashless transaction is taking place
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki ye sambhav he ki jaise desh kaa vikaas hoga, logon kaa vikaas hoga, cashles main bhi vruddhi hogi
 However, it is not possible that the circulation of the note will be completely eliminated
 unhone kaha ki aisa koi bhi desh vishwa main nahin he, jahaan puri tarah se cashles arthvyavastha he
 He said that America does not have a completely cashless economy
 vahaan bhi mahaj 40 se 50 fisadi cashles tranjection ho rahaa he
 Anonymous property does not mean just the result of the demonetisation or the consequences, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that he has been saying since the time the demonetisation was implemented that black money cannot be controlled only by demonetisation
 nitish kumaarane kaha ki jabatak benami sampattiyon par sakhti se hamalaa nahin kiya jayega, tabatak kalaadhan samaapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Chief Minister of Bihar said that to eliminate black money from its roots, it is necessary to attack the benami property of big people
 unhone kaha ki benami sampatti kaa matlab sirf note nahin hota, balki unki jameen, makaan, heere, sone-chaandi par sakhti se hamalaa bolne kii zarurat he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that there is a huge amount of black money in the country and there is a need to organize an attack to eliminate it
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar agar sahi myne main desh se kalaadhan samaapt karnaa chaahati he, to benami sampatti par hamalaa bolne kii yojana banaakar usapar amal karnaa chahie
 The proposal to issue Sovereign Bond abroad within three weeks of the presentation of the budget is under question
 ye vivaad khul kar tab saamne aayaa jab sarkaar ne purv vitt sachiv es si garg kaa transfar kar diya
 Has this proposal of raising money from foreign countries through sovereign bonds got mired in controversies? This question arises from the transfer of Finance Secretary SC Garg
 isse naaraaz bataae ja rahe garg viares ke liye aavedan kar chuke hai, haalanki daawa kar rahe hai ki sarkaar main kisi ne prastaav par kabhi sawaal nahin uthaaya
 According to sources, after SC Garg stepped down from the finance ministry, the new secretary has taken charge, who may consider the proposal afresh
 khabar ye bhi he ki prastaav ko aage vichaar ke liye ek samiti ke paas bheja ja saktaa he
 Sovereign bonds are guaranteed by the government, but this option has been opposed since the 1991 economic reform program
 ab virodh sangh parivaar ke andar se bhi ho rahaa he
 Experts believe that there is also a danger of issuing sovereign bonds
 ye bond videshi karensiyon main hi hota he or agar rupaya kisi bhi vajah se gira to sarkaar kii dendaree badi hoti jaaegi
 Clearly, the dispute is getting bigger and the government will have to resolve it quickly
 pakistan ne bharat ke saath siries khilne ke liye apane zimbabwe daure ko taal diya he
 According to the board, the series between India and Pakistan is due to be held in December and the team's tour of Zimbabwe is not possible
 pisibi ne zimbabwe ko agle saal siries khilne kaa bharosa dilaayaa he
 Three odis and two T20 matches between India and Pakistan are to be played in the last week of December although the date of the matches has not been officially announced
 donon deshon ke bich 2008 mumbai atake ke baad se koi bhi siries nahin kheli gai he
 The PCB has assured Zimbabwe to play the series next year
 bharat or pakistan ke bich teen vanade or do tii-20 match disambar ke aakhri hafte main khelaa janaa he haalanki maichon kii taarikh kaa aadhikarik elaan nahin hua he
 No series have been played between the two countries since the 2008 Mumbai attack

 In Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, the contest is clearly between Congress and BJP, but in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is spending a lot of pen in ink in electoral mathematics
 dilli main bijepi or congress bhale hi muqabla ek duusare ke viruddh hi bataaen, lekin hakeekat yah he ki 'aap' ne donon kii hi neend uda di he
 Different news channels and surveys may be whichever party is claiming to be a government or a hung legislative assembly, but the truth is that AAP has set many new trends that not only other parties are following
 Rather, these trends can be called the small beginning of a new chapter in Indian politics
 saaf chhavi kaa ummidavaar yani eemaandaar netranna hajaare ke aandolan se hi yah baat prakhar thi ki partiyaan saaf chhavi vaale ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaaren
 The BJP has gone into the political abyss after the Aam Aadmi Party's unofficial campaigning for the Chief Minister's unofficial claimant Arvind Kejriwal
 harshavardhan ko ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 While Vijay Goel was the face of BJP in Delhi for the last several months, but suddenly the BJP poster burst and a new hero emerged
 vajah saaf thi- kejariwal kii takkar kaa saaf chhavi vaala cheharaa
 People should not tell the issue
 Anna and his team had a very big suggestion that people should decide the issues of their area and their solution
 saath hi har kaam ke liye logon ko sarkaar kaa munh naa taakna pade
 The AAP claimed that they would issue their manifesto after talking to people in every assembly constituency of Delhi
 kuch hi din baad bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi apane ghoshnaa patr ke liye janata kii raay maangate hai or uske agle hi din shahjade rahul gandhi bhi aisa hi karte hai! baat bilkul saaf he ki sab kuch ittefaq nahin ho saktaa
 Before the election, as many regions, every party makes claims like breaking the moon and stars in the manifesto, but do not ask for any reply on them, so no one is willing to come under the purview of RTI
 aisi dakiyanoosee soch ke bich aap ne ek bada kadam lete hue kaha ki vah dilli main har vidhansabha kshetra kaa alag ghoshnaa patr banaayenge taaki har ilaake ke samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ho sake
 a few days ago BJP also issued a separate manifesto of Model Town and said to release the rest
 sawaal yah he ki yadi bijepi is vishay par itani hi gambhir he to vah duusare rajyon main bhi aisa kyon nahin kar rahi?bijli ke damahar chunaav se pehle vipaksh main baithi partiyaan mahangaai, bhrashtachar jaise anek muddon kaa ronaa roti hai or sarkaar ko kosti hai
 But whether she will overcome them or not and if she does, no one tells the 'roadmap'
 kaaphi samay pehle aap ne dilli kii bijli companiyon kaa sieji se audit karvaa kar bijli ke daam aadhe karne kaa vaada kiya
 On this, the BJP also played a 30 percent band
 isse pehle shaayad aisa kabhi nahin hua ki kisi pramukh party ne daam kam karne kaa ek aankada pesh kiya ho
 Not necessarily two, two or four years, in 2003, 'bharat Uday' submerged the BJP and in 1977 the plight of the Congress was not hidden from anyone
 jaruri nahin ki saaf-suthere ummidavaaron ko utaarne kaa vaayada karke yaa logon kii mohalla sabhaayen banane kii baat kahkar aap chunaav jeet hi jaae, lekin kam se kam dilli main unhone aisa maahaul zarur bana diya he ki duusari partiyaan raajnneeti kii puraani chaalon ko bhuulakar, thodaa-bahut hi sahi, lekin kuch nae raste tay karti dikhaai de rahi hai
 Nobody can say how long Kejriwal or Aam Aadmi Party proves to be the horses of the race, but the copying of these new steps by other parties proves that in the short run of the very long race to improve Indian politics The first step may have been initiated
 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne 25 june 1975 ko puure desh main internal immergency kaa elaan kiya
 Behind this decision, Indira Gandhi, as Prime Minister, put forward some arguments in front of the country
 iske baavjood itihaas ke pannon main is faisle ko kaale aksharon main darj karne kii kavayad hui haalanki itihaaskaar yah bhi daawa karte hai ki is ek faisle se indira kii sakht faisla lene kii chhavi desh ke saamne ai or raajnneetik virodhiyon ne unki tulana germany ke purv taanashaah hitler tak se kii
 On the same lines, the image of the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tough decision-making leader was formed on 6 November 2016 when the demonetisation was announced
 is ek elaan se deshbhar main sanchalit lagbhag 86 fisadi mudra ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Prime Minister Modi, along with the announcement, gave his argument behind taking this decision to the country
 haalanki ek baar phir vipaksh kii bhoomika main baithi congress is faisle ko galat tehraae jane kii ummid lagaae baithi he lekin satta ke galiyaaron main aam raay he ki is faisle se pradhanmantri modi ne desh ke saamne apni yah chhavi bana lee he ki kade faislon ko lene main vah hichakate nahin he
 During the last 50 years, two Prime Ministers and two political parties built their image with the help of these two decisions
 haalanki donon hi faisle bade str par desh kii aarthik or saamaajik sthiti par prabhaav daalane vaale hai
 Therefore, it is important to understand how the reasons behind taking these major decisions were met over time and whether these decisions proved successful in their purpose? According to the Economic Survey of Emergency after 1975 and 1976 During the period, there was a sharp jump in agricultural production due to good monsoon in the country
 immergency se pehle paanch saal ke ausat 41
 49 in 1975 compared to 5 million tonnes of rice production
 7 million ton or 1976 main 42
 8 million tonnes of production was recorded
 isi tarah immergency ke in do saal ke dauraan genhu or daal ke utpaadan main kramash: 20 or 30 fisadi kii oochaal darj hui thi
 Read this: Congress accusation- Shah, the bank whose director, demonetisation had witnessed a good growth in industrial production in the country during 1975 and 1976, on the lines of the increase in the oldest production of demonetisation
 jahaan 1975 main audyogic utpaadan 6
 1 percent increase while in 1976 it increased to 10
 4 fisadi kii oochaal dekhne ko mili thi
 Before the Emergency, the biggest challenge to inflation was the Indira Gandhi government in 1974
 is dauraan mahangaai dar dabl disit main darj hui thi
 But in 1975, wholesale inflation fell to -1 due to steps taken against black marketing and hoarding just before the Emergency
 1 fisadi or 1976 main 2
 1 percent was recorded
 vahiin khaadya mahangaai jahaan 1974 main 38 fisadi ke str par thi, immergency lagu hone ke baad yah -4
 9 percent and -5
 1 fisadi darj hui
 After the Emergency came into force in the country, exports of Rs 4042 crore during 1975 and Rs 5142 crore in 1976 were recorded, compared to exports of Rs 3328 crore in 1974
 vahiin aayaat ke kshetra main bhi bada antar darj hua
 While the import growth rate was 53 per cent in 1974, the import rate was 16 during 1975 and 1976
 5 fisadi or 3
 6 percent was recorded
 haalanki immergency ke dauraan sarkari kharch main hue ijaphe ke chalate bada bajet ghaataa darj hua
 But the special thing is that apart from higher spending in the Emergency, the Central Government registered a big increase in earnings
 immergency se pehle ke varshon ke dauraan kharaab vikaas dar ke baad 1975 or 1976 main 9
 7 percent and 12
 6 fisadi kaa ijapha kendra sarkaar kii kamai par darj hua
 Read this: In the PNB scam, there was collusion at the top level, hiding the bank's post-demonetisation figures compared to these economic figures, it is clear that during the Emergency, economic boom was recorded while demonetisation slowed the economy
 Worked immergency ke baad jahaan kendra sarkaar kii kamai main ijapha hua vahiin notebandi ke baad khud rigerv bank kii kamai ko chot pahunchi
 During the Emergency, while the GDP of the country registered an increase, demonetisation increased the GDP from 1 to 1
 2 fisadi kii nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Where the first 8 of demonetisation
 01 fisadi jidipi growth darj hui vahiin notebandi ke baad 7
 11 percent GDP growth was recorded
 immergency ke dauraan desh main vyaapt mahangaai se raahat mili thi
 According to the data, after the announcement of demonetisation in November 2016, where inflation declined during November but there was an increase in inflation in the following months
 vahiin notebandi ke baad jidipi main darj hui giravat ke aankadon se saaf jaahir he ki desh main krishi utpaadan or audyogic utpaadan ko notebandi ke faisle se bada nuksaan pahunchaa
 Although the long-term impact of demonetisation is yet to be seen, it can be said that the decision of emergency and demonetisation would have adverse effect on the economic-social aspects based on the current data

 2
 chandra grahan ke dauraan koi bhi shubh kaary nahin karnaa chahie
 3
 chandra grahan ke dauraan prakruti zyada samvedansheel ho jaati he

 australia ke khilaaf (india vs Australia) teen vanade maichon kii siries (ODI Series)main 0-1 se pichad rahi team india (team India) ko duusare vanade se pehle kai chintaaon kaa samaadhaan talashna hoga

 However, Dhoni scored 51 runs in this match and he could not rotate the strike fast
 51 ran banane ke liye unhone 96 genden khelin
 In the first ODI, the bowlers gave the hosts a chance to score 288 runs while batsmen like captain Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Ambati Rayudu and Dinesh Karthik failed

 com / jciyxsdoibind vs Aus: Bhuvneshwar Kumar stated that the reason for the first ODI performance was not good
 
 This slow innings of Dhoni (MS Dhoni) creates the possibility of a change in the batting order
 dhoni paanchaven number par utarate hai or upakptain rohit kaa maananaa he ki unhen upar aana chahie
 However, looking at the Indian team's practice session, it is clear that the team will not change the batting order right now
 sidney cricket maidan par dhoni ko pari ke chauthe over main hi utarana padaa jo kam hi hota he
 For the past two years, Rohit, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli have performed so well that Dhoni (MS Dhoni) never had to come so soon
 chauthe number par dhoni kaa ballebaaji ausat 52 
 The current average is 50 which is 95
 11 se zyada he
 He averages 50 at number five
 70 or chathe par 46 
 33, but lower-than-average strike rate is important
 dhoni kaa chauthe number par strike rate 94 
 His career strike rate is 21 which is 87
 60 se behatar he
 India played the last ODI in Australia in January 2016, in which Dhoni scored 18 runs in two matches at number four
 us siries ke baad se dhoni ne aath vanade main chauthe number par ballebaaji kii he
 Their average is 24
 75 rahaa jabaki strike rate 77 
 There has been 34
 duusare vanade se pehle sambhavit team kaa elaan nahin kiya gaya he
 Ind vs Aus: Kohli posted a photo with Anushka before the second ODI, and the fans gave the news to Vijay Shankar, who was late in the afternoon and may not be available for selection
 hardik pandya kii gaiyr maujuudagi main team kaa santulan banaaye rakhana badi chunauti hoga
 In the Asia Cup and the series against the West Indies, he was out due to injury while the advantage of landing three spinners in the subcontinent
 videsh main uske nahin hone kaa team ke pradarshan par asar padegaa
 Despite complaining of questionable action, Ambati Rayudu can bowl in international cricket, now it remains to be seen what the team management does
 vaise spin gendbaaji ke lihaaj se kedaar jadhav (kedar Jadhav)bhi vikalp ho sakate hai or dinesh karthik hi jagah unhen mauka diya ja saktaa he
 There is little scope for change in bowling combination in the first ODI, although Khaleel Ahmad is not in form
 unhone yujavendra chahal ke saath nets par gendbaaji kii
 Of the three fast bowlers, Mohammed Shami was the most effective in the first match and will not be excluded in such a crucial match
 team prabandhan rabindra jadeja ke harfanmaulaa hunar par bharosa kaayam rakh saktaa he or aise main chahal kii turant vaapasi sambhav nahin lagati
 The focus of India's performance will be on the top three batsmen
 kohli kaa is maidan par sabhi praroopon main ausat 73 
 He has been 44 and his average in odis is 46
 66 he
 There will also be an eye on the form of Dhawan, who was the third batsman not to play domestic cricket this season apart from Dhoni and Rayudu
 dhoni test cricket ko alavida kah chuke hai jabaki rayudu ne ranjai satr shuru hone se pehle hi pratham shrenee cricket ko alavida kah diya
 Dhawan was spending time with family in Melbourne instead of playing Ranji
 sidney main pehali gend par out hone ke baad unke form par bhi ungali oongli uthne lagi he
 Australia is yet to announce the final XI but there is little hope of a change in the squad

 Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh has said that he has no qualms in calling the Naxalites 'terrorists' and 'militants', because there is no such thing as the name of humanity

 Ramesh said that if the Naxalites come forward for talks, the Central Government will welcome them and for this, talks can be done on the basis of the framework set by the then Home Minister p Chidambaram
 unhone mana ki saranda naksaliyon se puri tarah mukt nahin he lekin unhone vishwaas jataayaa ki aane vaale samay main saranda kii sthiti main jabardast badlaav hoga
 Ramesh said, `` The way people in Saranda yesterday demanded to remove the power and shortage of teachers in schools and even raised slogans, it has encouraged me
 ’unhone kaha, ‘saranda main hamane kaaphi had tak jeet hasil kar lee he or adivaasiyon ko khuli hawa main saans lene kaa avasar pradaan kiya he jiske parinaam sheeghra dekhne ko milenge

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has taken the historic step of providing 10 percent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions to the upper castes
 loksabhaa or rajyasabha main samvidhan sanshodhan bill paas bhi ho gaya
 It will also become law after the signing of President Ram Nath Kovind, but do you know that there is a period of terrible unemployment in the country
 is samay 3 karod 10 lakh noujvaan berozegaar he
 The unemployment rate in India is beyond 6 percent
 har saal ek karod noujvaan naukari khojane nikalate hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether reservation is really going to give any relief to the unemployed
 india today kii ore se daakhil artiai main railway kii naukariyon ko lekar bada khulaasa hua he
 Government is sitting on the job of unemployed in railways
 bhartiya railway desh main sabase adhik naukari dene vaali sanstha he
 But in November 2018, 2 lakh 66 thousand 790 posts in the railway alone are vacant
 ye keval group si or di kii naukariyon ke khaali pad kaa aankada he
 It will cross 3 lakhs if group a and b jobs are added
 har saal railway se karmchaaree ritair ho rahe hai, lekin unki jagah ko bharaa nahin ja rahaa he
 In a way, these jobs are being abolished
 2008-09 main 13,86,011 railway karmchaaree the
 This figure has come down to 13,08,323 in 20116-17
 aankadon ke mutabik, 2014-15 main ritair hue lagbhag 59960 hajaar karmchaaree or naukari mili 15191
 That is, 44769 jobs were over
 iske agle saal ritair hue 53654 or rakhe gaye 27995, matlab 25659 naukari khatm ho gai
 Similarly, 58 thousand 373 retired in 2016-17 and kept only 19587
 matlab 38768 naukari khatm ho gai
 The Modi government had talked about giving new jobs and even in the jobs that were there, the government finished 109214 jobs
 ek or aankada gaur karne vaala he
 This is the report of the Labor Bureau of the Government of India
 manmohan sarkaar ke antim teen saal main salanaa 5 lakh 69 hajaar nai naukari mili
 In Modi's first year 2014-15, only 1 lakh 55 thousand new jobs were found
 modi ke duusare saal 2015-16 main 2 lakh 31 hajaar nai naukari mili
 It was proved by this that the present government has no answer to the pain of unemployed youth
 sochie ki sarkaar kah rahi he ki naukariyon kii baadh ai hui he
 Leave new employment, if old survives, then respect
 2015 main tisies ke lagbhag 5 hajaar karmchaariyon kii naukari gai
 In 2016, 14,000 employees of L&T lost their jobs

 gujarat police ke is adhikari ke liye asaram baapu guru the or narendra modi govind
 Willing to do whatever Modi benefits, and be eager to serve Asaram
 ji
 Vanzara's life was simple, successful was not easy
 diaiji ho gaye the, diji hone ke madhur swapn raaton main madhu gholte
 When he woke up in the morning, Baba preached in his ears
 baba ke samaran ke baad jihva par gaumata kaa doodh jo baba ke motera ashram ke gaushala se hi aata tha, chaahe vanzaara kahin bhi padasthapit hon
 Then carrying pistols in his hands and killing unarmed people on the path of Dharmo Rakshati Rakshaktha was also like following Dharma
 vishwaas tha ki yahi satya kaa maarg he, guru kaa aashirwad he or govind kaa varadahast bhi
 But things changed with the killing of Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausar Bi
 kanoon kii vardi se sitare tut gaye, kismat foot gai
 The keeper of the law went behind the bars of the law
 guru kaa aashirwad kaam naa aayaa, upar nazar uthaai to govind ke varadahast kii jagah jail kii kothri kii risati, jang lagi chat ne le lee thi
 Everything was shattered but one thing was complete, the hope of Asaram's grace and Narendra Bhai would find some way out of it
 varshon tak rasta nahin niklaa tab bhi yakeen tha narendrabhai is vipatti se nikaal lenge or baapu asaram kii krupa se sab thik ho jayega
 Vanzara accepted the destiny but did not break the vow not to open her mouth
 aisa kuch nahin kaha jo modi kii singh si chaati par kaante sa chubhe
 Then why this 10-page arrow? There are many reasons for this, but the most interesting is the linking of it to the arrest of Asaram
 khabaron ke mutabik asaram kamasin ladakiyon or yuva mahilaon ko nitant ekant main aashirwad dete the, raat ke aath baje ke baad
 a girl studying in Asaram's ashram in Chhindwara in far-off Madhya Pradesh was declared by the seekers in the control of demons
 phir ladki ke pita ko ye samaadhaan sujhaayaa kii baba agar akele main prasad de denge to bhoot langot lekar bhaag khadey honge
 Then Baba was in Jodhpur
 ladki ko jodhpur laayaa gaya
 Baba took him to his private hut and the blocks were closed
 ladki kii maa baahar prarthana karti rahi, asaram kaa naam japti rahi
 When the daughter came out after an hour and a half, the ground had slipped under the feet of the faith of that family
 ekant kaa aashirwad ek mahapaap tha, aisa ladki ne bataaya to maa-baap kaanp gaye
 He decided to punish Asaram for this sin and finally put him on trial
 yon shoshan kaa
 Of rape
 baba ne anakani kii, dhamkee thi, ladki par laanchhan lagaae par aakhiran kanoon kii giraft main aae
 When Vanzara read this news in jail, his faith was not even fragmented by this hypocrisy
 guru par vipadaa kaa pahaad tutaa he or govind maun hai, ye mere govind kaise hai, koun hai? kyonki ye pehali baar nahin he ki modi ne asaram kii sahaayta nahin kii
 Modi had opened a front against Asaram
 ashram dwaara zamin hathiyaane ke aaropon par, phir ashram main do bacchon ke maut hone par
 Modi did not leave an opportunity to push Asaram
 par ishwar kii chaal ko naasamajh insaan kaise samajhataa, isliye vanzaara vidroh par nahin utre the
 Now Guru like Govind was in jail, and Govind like Guru was in Agra, Chief Minister of Gandhinagar
 vanzaara ko zaraa naa bhaayaa
 He wrote a ten-page resignation letter
 usamen bhi modi ko govind bataaya jo amit shah naamak pret ke prabhaav main satya or asaty ke bich bhed nahin kar paa rahe
 The law was never believed by the keeper of the law
 tab bhi nahin jab nirdosho ko goli se udaaya or tab bhi nahin jab khud kanoon kii qaid main the
 Did not ask for help from law
 aas to asaram or narendrabhai modi par hi tiki thi
 Asaram's arrest filled the tower of Aas
 vanjaaraa tut gaye
 Wrote a tale of agony on ten pages
 par afsos, ki afsos nahin
 Just like his Govind
 jail main vanzaara aadhyatmik ho gaye hai
 So much so that he has published three books on spirituality
 singh garjana bhaag 1 va 2 or ran tankaar
 Baba became disgruntled for fellow prisoners because when Vanzara spoke, the words would be less discourse
 kanoon kii naukari kyon karen jab kanoon par bharosa nahin
 No trust in Modi either
 patr diya
 Abandoned all
 jab nikalate to vanzaara baapu ban ashram chalaate
 But oh my God, the Guru also came out
 tyaag se moksh nahin miltaa
 Atonement is the first step to salvation
 jo na guru main he, naa shishy main, naa shishy ke govind main
 The hypocrisy of those who punish everyone sitting on the pillar of the pillar is now fragmented

 sirus mistre ko hataae jane ke baad tata sans ke nae chairman kii jari khoj main kai naam saamne aae hai
 These include Indra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi, Arun Sarin, former head of the Vodafone Group, and Noel Tata, chairman of Tata retail unit Trent
 kuch or bhi aise candidet hai jo tata sans ke chairman kii res main hai
 These include TCS CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran, TCS chief s Ramadurai before him and Jaguar Land Rover chief Roff Spate
 ratan tata kii aguwai main paanch sadasyon kaa panel tata sans ke nae chairman kii talash main juta he
 But out of all the names of potential candidates, Chandrasekhar's pan appears to be the heaviest
 53 saal ke chandrashekharan bijness jagat main chandra ke naam se mashhoor hai
 Chandrasekharan is leading the group's most valuable company
 tata group kii sabhi companiyon ke pramukhon main roff spet hi ekmaatr aise ummidavaar hai jo chandrashekharan ko is res main takkar de sakate hai
 Both TCS and Jaguar Land Rover companies are making profits and have outperformed the group
 haalanki abhi chandrashekharan ke naam kaa elaan nae chairman ke taur par nahin kiya gaya he lekin chandrashekharan kii tulana mistre se kiya janaa jaruri he jinhen pichley dinon tata sans ke chairman pad se ekaek hataa diya gaya tha
 Let's see how Chandrasekaran can prove to be a better chairman of Tata Sons than Mistry
 1
 Skilled leadership: Chandrasekaran is the CEO and Managing Director of TCS since 2009
 isse pehle wo tisies ke sioo or akjicutive diarector rahe hai
 In 2009, when the IT industry was going through a crisis, Chandrasekaran not only saved the company from global economic slowdown due to his efficient leadership but the company met the growth target and reached the heights
 is tarah kathinaaiyon se jujhane ke skill main chandrashekharan mistre par baari padate dikhaai dete hai
 There was no such crisis in the industry during Mistry's 4-year tenure
 mistre ne apana puraa focus sirf kamai vaali companiyon par rakhaa or group ke bheetar talmail bithakar chalane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 2
 vijan:sirus mistre main 'vijan kii kami' he
 For this reason, Mistry was also removed as the chairman of Tata Sons
 chandrashekharan kii image ek 'vijanary' siio ke taur par rahi he
 It is clear from the way Chandrasekaran works that he takes care of the moral values of the group
 lekin mistre is kasuti par khare nahin utre
 3
 anubhav:sirus mistre kii umr 48 saal he
 While Chandrasekaran is 53 years old
 aise main anubhav ke lihaaj se bhi chandrashekharan mistre se behatar ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 Mistry was the youngest chairman of the group, becoming the chairman of Tata Sons four years ago, while Chandrasekaran is one of the youngest ceos of the Tata group
 sirus mistre ko tata group main jo kuch bhi mila usamen unki viraasat kaa bhi bada yogadan he
 But on the basis of his work in the Chandrasekharan group he went ahead and made his mark
 4
 Track Record: Although both Mistry and Chandrasekaran have been associated with the Tata group, Chandrasekaran's track record has been better than that of Mistry
 2012 main tata sans kaa chairman banaae jane se pehle mistre 2006 main tata group se pehle baar jude
 Mistry worked with Tata Elxsi and Tata Power but under his leadership these companies did not perform well
 vahiin, 1987 main tisies se jude chandrashekharan apane kaam ke boote aaj in bulandiyon tak pahunche hai
 Interestingly, even though Mistry was the chairman of the group, Chandrasekaran's salary was much more than that
 5
 Acceptance: Mistry is born in a Parsi family in Mumbai but his citizenship is from Ireland
 sirus mistre ke parents kii jaden bhi bharat main hai lekin inaki naagarikta ireland kii he
 However, Egyptians fall under the category of permanent citizens of India
 inaki padhai likhaai bhi baahar ke deshon main hui he
 At the same time, Chandrasekaran of Indian origin was born in Tamil Nadu and his studies were also written in India
 kareeb 30 saalon se tata group se jude rahe chandrashekharan kii tata group main sweekaaryaktaa mistre kii tulana main behatar he
 It is being said that Cyrus Mistry was also seen as an 'outsider' in the group
 iske alaava chandrashekharan ne group ke logon kaa bharosa jis str tak jeeta he, mistre is tarah kaa bharosa nahin jeet paae the
 Barack Obama's becoming president is not just a black victory, but a victory of the movement that had been in America for years
 baraak obama ne jeet se martin luther king ke sapane ko saakaar kar diya he
 That dream was to fight against the breed
 duniya ke sabase shaktishaalee desh main barbari kaa sapana
 Obama made that dream come true
 naslbhed ke khilaaf martin luther king ne kaha tha ki meraa yah sapana he ki america main logon kii pahchaan unke gunon ke aadhaar par ho na ki rang ke aadhaar par
 But this dream of King did not go well for many and in 1968 someone killed King
 lekin unka yah sapana mara nahin
 Obama has fulfilled his dream today
 baraak obama ne duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk america kii kaman sambhaal lee
 Obama sworn in as America's 44th President
 obama ke shapath grahan samaaroh kai maamalon main aitihaasik rahaa
 In Capitol Hill where Obama was sworn in
 vahaan 20 lakh se zyada lakh log
 In this way America got the first black president
 obama ne is ahm din kii shuruyaat kii bhagwaan ke dar se
 From his home he first went to church, took blessings from the Pope and then moved to the White House
 shapath grahan ke liye obama white house pahunche to unki agavaani kii purv raashtrapati jorge bush ne
 Then both of them drank coffee together
 obama kii patni mishael obama ne is maukey par laura bush ko vidaai kaa tohfa bhi diya
 After about 20 minutes of meeting, Bush and Obama lost control of the White House towards Capitol Hill, where two million people were waiting for a historic moment
 shapath lene ke baad raashtra ke naam apane pehle sandesh main obama ne kaha ki america aatankwaad ko kisi bhi keemat par bardaasht nahin karegaa
 This is the promise of the first black president of America
 obama ne aatank failaane waalon ko chetavanee di ki wo unhen haraa kar maanenge
 President Obama expressed that his priority would include the restoration of peace in Afghanistan
 jald se jald afghanistan main halaat sudhaarney kii koshish kii jaaegi
 President Obama's first speech also showed a glimpse of universalism
 unhone sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan or sadbhaav bana kar chalane kii baat kahi
 The whole world is going through an economic recession along with America
 obama ne apane pehle bhaashan main jataa diya ki mandi se jujhna or use dur karne kii bharpoor koshish kii jaaegi
 For this, he also appealed to the countrymen to work unitedly
 obama ko raashtrapati chunakar america ne rang bhed kii jang jeetne kaa elaan kar diya
 The country's first black president also clearly said that America has become a country where people of any caste and creed can live freely
 baraak hossain obama ke jivan ke pramukh ghatnakram: Formula One driver Michael Schumacher's condition is better than before, but still remains critical
 france ke jaanchakartaaon ko ummid he ki durghatana ke samay shoomakar ne jo helmet pahana tha, usapar lage camere se kuch jawaab mil sakate hai
 It is not known whether this gopro camera will have the film of that scene when Schumacher's head hit the rock
 yaa phir is durghatana se us samay kii photo kharaab to nahin ho gai kyonki unke girane se helmet do tukdon main tut gaya tha
 Investigators may also find clues from a film made by a German eyewitness who claimed to have captured Schumacher's accident on his camera, according to a German news magazine Der Spiegel reported
 magazine ke anusaar pratyakshdarshi ne bataaya ki shoomakar dhalaan se itmeenaan se utar rahe the or unki raftaar 20 kimi prati ghanta thi
 Schumacher is a 7-time world champion and has retired
