 isliye unki niyukti par roak lagaai jaae
 "interlocutory applications" are applied to appeal for immediate relief on cases where the law requires intervention

 This is the Prime Minister's eighth visit to Gujarat in the last nine months, and assembly elections are due in the state in November this year
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) rajya main lagaataar paanchavin baar satta main aane ke liye prayasarat he, or pradhanmantri ke is dhuandhar daure tathaa kai yojanaon ko launch kiye jane se saaf he ki party uttar pradesh tathaa anya rajyon main haal hi main mili kamyaabi ko dohraane kii puri koshish kar rahi he

 kya hai ye vokational training centre? pashchim kaa media inhen kansontrishan camp kahata he
 But China has a strong objection to this
 yahaan ke jaankaar or adhikariyon kaa ek mat he ki uighar muslimon, jinke khilaaf aatank ke gambhir maamle nahin hai, unhen in vokashnal centre bhejnaa sahi he
 This makes them easy to deradicalize and they can learn a job and make a living as an ordinary Chinese citizen with the help of the government
 sunne main bura nahin lagata, jab tak ki aap jaakar khud in centaron main rah rahe logon se baat nahin karte
 After talking, the matter of the officers only starts to plead
 kam se kam mujhe yahi laga
 Officials in Xinjiang showed us two vocational training centers to journalists
 vahaan le gaye
 Let the trainers there, talk to the teachers
 haalanki do ahm chizein jo aapako janani chahie wo he bhashaa kii samasya or adhikariyon kii maujuudagi
 In fact, most of the Uighurs in Xinjiang speak Uighur language
 ek interprator yaa dubhashiya iskaa mandarin bhashaa main anuwaad karata he or maderin or angrezi jaanane vaala dubhashiya hamaare liye ise angreji main anuvaadit karata he
 Therefore, in these centers, we always tried to make sure that the translation is honest and there is no Lost in Translation
 duusari baat ye ki khaskar in centaron main hamaare saath kai chini adhikari rahe, kam se kam 12 se 15
 So was their presence in any way influencing the statements of Uyghar people kept in these centers
 jis pehle vokational training centre main hamen le jaaya gaya uskaa naam tha- vensu county vokational skills training centre
 Outside the city, about 40 minutes by bus, a large area and some very common buildings inside the boundary wall
 ghuste ke saath daahine haath par basketbaal court par kuch yuva basketbaal khelte nazar aae
 i wanted to make a video of them, wanted to talk to them but the Chinese officials present together said that this game is part of Curriculum, can not stop in the middle, they will get a chance to talk to them later
 andar sabase pehle ek dance class main le jaaya gaya jahaan kuch uighar muslim yuvaaon ne paaramparik or modern dance kar dikhaaya
 Then we went to a class where Mandarin was being taught
 hamane chaatro se kuch sawaal poochne kii ijazat maangi
 Talked to many students - both on camera and without camera, through interpreter
 inase hamane poocha ki kin aparaadhon ke liye inhen yahaan laayaa gaya he
 These crimes are reading the Quran, wearing a hijab, performing niqah without license, watching or downloading jihadi videos on the phone, listening to information on religion in illegal places, refusing to seek government help, telling families to watch TV as non-islamic, women at home Refusing to apply makeup as un-islamic
 inase or adhikariyon se baat kar lagata he ki sabhi maamalon main kisi ne kisi inaki report police ko di
 But it also seems that when someone is watching a video on their phone alone, how did anyone know? In this, there is doubt whether the online activities of people are being monitored electronically? But what is the biggest thing about this center? That is that at least 99 percent of Uighur Muslims who are training here say that they no longer believe in Islam
 kisi prakaar kii koi prarthana nahin karte
 Do not believe in any religion
 to sawaal uthta he ki aakhir aisa kya hua ki jo log ativaadee islam kii taraf jhuk rahe the unhone puri tarah dharm hi tyaag diya
 When asked, they say that they have understood their mistake
 lekin ye meri or vahaan maujuud kai patrakaron kii samaj main nahin aayaa
 Is deradicalization a complete renunciation of religion or a move away from extremism? Does this happen anywhere else in the world? After all, what was explained here that these people gave up religion? We also asked them that because any religious activity is prohibited in any school college in China, do we offer Namaz or go to mosque when we go home during the holidays? Apart from two-three, everyone's answer was no
 ek patrkaar ne yahaan tak poocha ki kya aapako yatnaaen di jaati hai jisapar ye hansane lage or kaha nahin
 But even then, the question remains whether the meaning of deradicalization here is to end religion? Is this their decision or imposition of these Uygar Muslims? And is this decision really due to loss of faith or a way to make life easier? zyada samay tak kaam karnaa or kam samay sona aapke dil ke swasthya ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 This has been revealed in a new study
 damakal or apaat chikitsa sevaaon, resident chikitsakon tathaa adhik tanaav vaala kaam karne vaale anya logon ko 24 ghante kii shift main kaam karne ke liye kaha jaataa he, jisase unhen sone kaa kam samay miltaa he
 Danielle Kuetting, lead author of the study at the University of Bonn, Germany, said that for the first time, we have revealed that cardiac contractility (the natural ability of the heart to shrink), blood pressure and blood pressure in people with less sleep in the context of a 24-hour shift
 There is an unnatural increase in heart rate
 tippaniyan Kuating and his colleagues averaged 31 in the study

 shodhakartaaon ne pratibhaagiyon ke rakt va mutr ke namoonay bhi ikattha kiye or raktchaap tathaa heart rate ko mapa gaay
 Blood pressure and heart rate were found to be higher in the short-term sleeping participants
 unhone kaha ki yah nishkarsh yah samajhane main hamaari madad karegaa ki kaam kaa bhaar tathaa shift ke ghante kis prakaar logon ke jivan ko prabhavit karte hai
 The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago
 germany ke uniwarsity of bon main adhyayan ke mukhya lekhak daniel kueting ne kaha ki pehali baar, hamane yah khulaasa kiya he ki 24 ghante kii shift ke sandarbh main kam neend lene vaale logon ke cardiyak contractility (dil ke sikudne kii swaabhaavik kshamta), raktchaap tathaa heart rate main aswabhaavik badhotaree hoti he
 The comments adhyayan main kueting tathaa unke saathiyon ne ausatan 31
 20 healthy radiologists in the age group of 6 years, including 19 men and one woman
 ausat teen ghante kii neend lene vaale har pratibhaagi kaa 24 ghante kii shift se pehle or baad main cardio vescular magnetic rizonans karaayaa gaya
 Researchers also collected blood and urine samples of participants and measured blood pressure and heart rate
 alpakaalik taur par kam neend lene vaale pratibhaagiyon kaa raktchaap tathaa heart rate adhik paaya gaya
 He said that this conclusion will help us understand how work load and shift hours affect people's lives
 yah nishkarsh chicago main radiological sosayadi of north america (aresaine) kii salanaa baithak main pesh kiya gaya

 When he was asked whether the wooden door could not have been made for Jack while he was drowning in the sea? Couldn't Jack have been saved? The director's reply was, 'this didn't happen because Jack had to die
 yah film marane or alag hone ke bare main thi
 If Jack had been alive, the film's ending would have been meaningless
 'titanic kaa aayaa nayaa trailor, 20 saal baad phir hogi reliccamran ne kaha, script ke 147wein panne par saaf tareeke se likhaa he ki jaik mar jaataa he
 Jack's death was decided from the point of view of art

 jaanate hai comic role ke liye mashhoor arshad varsi or saurabh patel se saji ye film kisi bani he
 What is the story of the film? The story of the movie is of Bhola Prasad Tripathi (arshad Warsi), which is completely opposite to his name
 uskaa kaam paise vaali ladki ko apane jaal main fanskar shaadi karnaa he
 His life has only one purpose, fill vermilion and earn Rs
 berozegaar bholaa apni biviyon ko bevakoof banaakar unase panse maangata he or aish karata he
 She has 12 wives, not 1,2
 bholaa kaa ye ghar-ghar kaa game badhiya chal rahaa tha, lekin tabhi uski jindagi main shani banakar murari (saurabh shukla) kii entry hoti he
 Which is a relative of Bhola's own wife and also a detective
 murari ko bholaa kii frodgiri pataa chal jaati he
 He tries to expose her but gets trapped on her own
 iske baad murari bholaa ko dost banaakar use sabak sikhaane kii thaanta he

 In some scenes, he is heavily outnumbered by Arshad Warsi
 sara lauren khubasurat lagi hai
 His work is good

 Why should the film be seen for acting actors like Rarshad Warsi and Saurabh Patel? donon ke bich filmaae gaye kai seens kaaphi rochak or phani hai
 The best part of the film is that despite being a straightforward storyline, it manages to keep the audience engaged to a large extent

 It is not necessary that every person knows how to speak
 kisi bhi profeshan ke liye communication skills sabase jaruri hai
 Unless you can communicate well, you will not grow
 behatar communication skills ke liye apanaaen ye tareeke:1
 For correct communication, first start judging your body language
 kahin aisa to nahin he ki aap bol to kuch rahe hote hai or aapkaa body language kah kuch or rahi hoti he
 2
 hameshaa shant or sahaj rahen
 Do not always try to add any type of pillow in the talk
 agar aap aisa karenge to saamne vaale par negative prabhaav padegaa
 3
 baatcheet ke dauraan sahi shabdon kachyanapake communication skills ko behatar banaata he
 As soon as you start focusing on the choice of words, people will start listening to your words carefully
 4
 Know who you are talking to while talking

 When you talk with a child, you resort to different types of communication

 Therefore, pay special attention to this thing while talking

 While talking, do not just focus on speaking
 dusron kii baton ko sune bhi
 It is believed that one can become a good speaker who is a good listener
 7
 The most important thing is to learn to believe what you say
 aisa nahin ki baat karte samay baar-baar apni hi kahi baton ko kaaten

 Om Namah shivaya according to Linga Purana, the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearer - the oval shaped stone is resembling mark of the Universe and bottom base as the Supreme Power holding the entire Universe in it
 Similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana: "the endless sky (that great void which contains the entire universe) is the Linga, the Earth is its base
 At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself
 " In yogic lore, the linga is considered the first form to arise when creation occurs, and also the last form before the dissolution of creation
 It is therefore seen as an access to Shiva or that which lies beyond physical creation

 agar aapako hero ko film main kaam karne ke liye raji karnaa he to jaahir he uski bhoomika heroin ke mukaable lambii rakhni hogi
 After all, films run in the same name
 is tarah aise sashart dhaanche ke bheetar apni kahani kehani he
 Every producer has to keep a special track ready, in which shuffling according to the hero's date
 heroin kii baari to baad main aati he, jise lubhaane ke liye super star kaa naam hi kaaphi he
 The heroines who 'suit' the superstar are few and the competition is very strong in that too
 mukhyadhara kii bade bajet vaali filmein amuman aise hi dhaanche main gadhi jaati hai
 Therefore it becomes even more important and important to keep a close watch on the way women are being introduced in Bollywood
 aasapaas kii paristhitiyaan bhi stri charitra main kisi bhi tarah ke badlaav ke viruddh hai
 The role of the audience is very important in this
 lihaaja unke bare main bhi sochna hoga
 i do not accept the idea of 'films are mirrors of society'
 filmein khalis manoranjan kaa saamaan hai
 The person coming to the theater after spending money, cannot see the mirror of '70mm'
 vaise bhi yah ek aisi kala he, jo danke kii chot par kahati he ki iske liye darshak hi maai-baap he
 My first push after moving from novels to films was when i heard pleas of pleasing the audience
 mere kadam dilli ke namchin sahityakaron kii sarthak-suruchipurna mehphilon, jahaan kitabon ko manoranjan kaa saadhan nahin, balki pathakon ke vichaar manthan ke liye saunpa gaya ‘karm’ mana jaataa he, se bilkul alag disha main mud chuke the
 Most of the people who come to see the film are male and will remain the same
 multiplex main stri-purush lagbhag baraabar dikh sakate hai
 But no one should cheat from this
 100 karod ru
 To cross the business of, films have to succeed in single screen theaters where the majority of the audience is male
 mahilaon main saarvajanik jagahon ke prati jo asuraksha kii bhaavana he, vah sidhe taur par film dekhne ja rahi bheed ke stri-purush anupaat main dikhaai detii he
 TV programs are female-centric, which can be enjoyed in a safe and fixed environment of the home, where women viewers are naturally present
 par badlaav kii aahat sunai de rahi he
 Women's participation on the work front is increasing and they are taking economic decisions
 english-winglish or kahani jaisi filmon ne na sirf manoranjan kiya, balki paise bhi kamaaye
 It is appropriate to assess the impact of films, but what about the lapse in understanding the nature of animals moving among us? It is time to prepare such a land of change where the roots of humanism sprout from roots and begin from us
 phir mere liye aasaan kya he? aaj apane hi boj tale bojhil ho janaa or kal ke badlaav kaa maseehaa ban kar itaraana? jo bhi ho, main jo kahani likhnaa chaahati hum, vahi likhuungi

 Did the government make a U-turn when the recently introduced and much-talked-about surrogacy bill (the law on rent womb for giving birth to a child)? Expert doctors of artificial reproductive system (IVF and surrogacy) are accused by the government
 in logon kaa kahana he ki bill celibrity ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya, na ki aam logon ko
 The Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction, an all-india organization of these doctors, has written an open letter strongly criticizing the ban on commercial surrogacy
 is bill ko pichley hafte cabinet ne hari jhandi di he
 These doctors say that the government has made a U-turn on this important bill in less than a year
 unke mutabik bill kaa jo khaakaa pichley saal janata kii raay jaanane ke liye rakhaa gaya tha or jo bill cabinet ne paas kiya vah bilkul alag hai

 hamaare pesheynt aakar bolte hai ki apane parivaar main gopneeyata sabase mahatvapurn he
 How can we leave him and if we do not give money to a mother for surrogacy, then what will be the cost later? " After the bill was passed by the cabinet, the government had said that it is bringing this provision to stop the market for renting the womb so that fraud can be prevented but now the question is being raised whether the needy couples have any inside the family Will there be a surrogate and what will happen to those couples who want to keep their child's birth process confidential? On the provision of waiting for 5 years after marriage, there is a question that if someone gets married late, then fertility can be lost by the completion of waiting for 5 years
 paisa dekar kisi mahila kii kokh bachche ke liye istemaal karne ke praavdhaan ko tab khatm kiya gaya jab yah bill is saal group of ministar ko bheja gaya

 videshi jodon ke bharat aakar sarogesi ke naam par mahilaon ke istemaal kii baat saamne aati rahi he
 "we have examples where foreign couples come from outside and use Indian women for surrogacy

 The services of this post office were halted in the year 1990 when it was half buried due to heavy snowfall

 If someone has said that the closure of a post office is the closure of a chapter, then it is rightly said
 
 
 bharat main 29 rajya hai jinamein shaayad hi koi aisa rajya hoga jahaan ke kisaanon ko koi samasya na ho parantu aisa sochna keval kalpanaaon main sambhav he kyonki aaj bharat kaa har kisaan apni- apni samasyaon ko lekar sadak par he wo chaahe apni karzmaafee ko lekar ho yaa apni fasal ke sahi daamon ko lekar lekin har jagah kisaanon ko niraashaa hi haath lag rahi he
 See special investigation till date
 rajasthan main pyaaz utpaadak kisaanon kii haalat itani kharaab he ki kharaab hote pyaaz ko mandiyon main 2 se 3 rou prati kilo ke hisaab se bechakar bhaagna pad rahaa hai
 The onions of the farmers 'houses are dry and rotting, but there is no one to wipe the farmers' tears
 rajasthande pyaaz utpaadak kisaanon ke haal jaanane ham rajya ke sabase bade pyaaz utpaadak zile sikar pahunche jahaan holi ke samay se hi pyaaz mandiyon main pahunchane laga tha is baar chunki fasal bhi banpar hui he isliye fasalon ke daam bhi kam hai isi intazaar main kisaan pichley teen maheene se baithe the ki kam se kam kheti kii laagat nikalne laayak pyaaz kii keemat milegi 
 At that time, the farmers were getting Rs 160 per mana i
e
 Rs 4 per kg
 lekin intazaar kaa fal to kadava hin niklaa
 Aajtak's team reached Sikar, a farmer in Sikar, where the smell of rotten onion smelled
 yahaan pyaaz kii chhatai ho rahi thi kyonki pyaaz rakhe-rakhe badi sankhya main sad rahi thi
 Farmer Babulal has come here with all his produce and the merchant has bought Rs 300 per quintal on the condition that the loss of rotten will be ours
 ise khareednevaala vyapari tejaraam se jab hamane poocha ki itani sasti pyaaz kyon kharid rahe ho to uskaa jawaab tha ki kisaan ke yahaan sad rahaa tha agar aage nahin bika to mere yahaan bhi to sad jayega
 What to do then darasal mandi main kisaan pyaaz lekar aa to rahe hai magar vyapari 2-3 rupye se zyada nahi de rahe hai isaki vajah ye bhi he ki vyapaaree jaanate hai ki kisaan ab or pyaaz apane paas nahi rakh saktaa he
 Because crop crops cannot be kept for more than three months
 pyaaz khule main rahati he or dhoop-barish se iskaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Farmers were desperately saying that we work for 10-12 hours per day, but we do not get anything, whereas sitting in such hours for 6 hours makes our fortune
 sikar ke rashidpur jate vakt hamen hairaan karanevaala nazaaraa dikhaa
 The farmers were sitting on a tractor on Bikaner Road in 44 degree temperature to sell the onion on a tractor
 pyaaz lekar haive kinare baithe in kisaanon kii kahani bataati he ki isbaar pyaaz kis kadar kisaanon ko rulaa rahi he
 Rajaram had cultivated a thousand tons of onions, then traders came to his village after Holi and were buying onions for 4 rupees a kilo
 tab isane isliye nahin bechaa ki 4 rupye prati kile bechney par 10 hajaar rupye prati bigha ke hisaab se nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 Now when he went to the market, he was buying 2 rupees a kg there
 isliye ye haive par tractor lagaakar baith gaya he ki khud hin bechuungaa
 Has come from morning to evening, but has been able to sell 20 kg of onion for Rs
 100 per kg
 udhar vyapaaree kah rahe hai ki pyaaz kaa bhandaaran ham nahin kar sakate hai
 It is a perishable crop
 upar se trasportesan mahangaa ho gaya he
 There is so much onion in the market that we are getting lower prices
 isbich aaj sabhi kisaanon se baat karne ke liye congress ke rajasthan ke pradesh adhyakshaschin payalatsikar ke kisaan mandi main pahunche or badi sabha karte hue maang kii ki bijepi apane vaade ke anusaar kisaanon ko 50 fisadi munaafe par fasal kharide
 Also raised the question that middlemen are not giving the price to the farmers, so why is the government not taking action
 rajasthan sarkaar kii taraf bhi inaki kei madad nahi hui he
 They have to sell onions in a hurry
 baharhaal kendra sarkaar ko jald hi uchit upaay sochna hoga kyonki mandsaur ke baad kal ko agar rajasthan ke kisaan bhi koi aandolan karne lagen to hairaani kii baat nahi hogi kyonki yah dard kaa ghobaar he jo aaj nahi to kal lekin fatega zarur

 satr nyaayalay ke faisle, abhiyojan paksh or bachaav paksh kii daleelon par gaur karte hue adaalat apana faisla likh rahi he or har pench par dhyaan de rahi he
 For example, Salman Khan went to the rain bar to prove it, but no one had seen Salman drinking alcohol that night
 hotel ke bill kii taarikh ko lekar bhi uljhan he
 The police introduced the bill on 27 September, but the date had changed when Salman left from there
 iske alaava salmaan khan gaadi chalaa rahe the yaa nahin is par bhi bhram he, kyonki kisi ne salmaan ko gaadi chalaate nahin dekha tha
 The comments gavaah number 8 ne kaha tha ki car main 4 log the
 The prosecution did not cross-examine him, which he should have done
 haadase ke baad darj exiaar main sharaab pie hone kii baat nahin likhi thi
 The idea of drinking alcohol was also added a few days later
 gavaah number 7 ne cross ekjamin main bhi kaha tha ki us samay salmaan khan ke munh se sharaab kii bu nahin aa rahi thim
 He was not even stumbling
 salmaan ne us raat sharaab pi thi yaa nahin, isaki jaanch ke liye blad sample lene ke pehle salmaan kii sahmati leni jaruri thi
 But Salman was not signed on the form

 There is also confusion over the date of the hotel bill

 Apart from this, there is confusion on whether Salman Khan was driving or not, because no one had seen Salman driving
 tippaniyan Witness No
 8 stated that there were 4 people in the car
 abhiyojan paksh ne use cross ekjamin nahin kiya, jo ki karnaa chahie tha
 The FIR filed after the accident did not mention that he had drunk alcohol
 sharaab pie hone kii baat bhi kuch dinon baad jodi gai
 Witness No
 7 also said in the cross exam that Salman Khan's mouth was not smelling of alcohol at that time
 wo ladkadaa bhi nahin rahe the
 To check whether Salman had drunk alcohol that night, it was necessary to get Salman's consent before taking a blood sample
 lekin form par salmaan ke sin nahin the
 Isn't it also clear that the front tire on the left side of Salman's car was torn before or after the accident? Writing of judgment on Salman Khan's appeal will continue on Wednesday

 Their chefs marinated in various varieties of meat, cooking and decorating them
 tabhi un sabko chaunkaate hue hotel sayaji ke prabandh nideshak (emdi) sajid dhanani khud rasoi main aa pahunche
 Dhanani told Chaudhary that customers are complaining about the kebabs not being hot
 zyaadaatar graahak tandoor kebab main min-mekh nikaal rahe the
 Choudhary was worried
 samasya ke hal ke rup main dhanani ne unhen ek sidhaa-sada vichaar diya, live gril counter banane kaa, yani graahakon ke saamne khaanaa garm karne kaa upaay
 Dhanani named it Do It Yourself
 iske baad choudhary ne upaay kiye ki takreeban 95 fisadi taiyaar kebab parose jaaen jinhen har mej par maujuud chote grills (angeethee) par graahak khud senk saken

 "they give the example that if you put more vegetables and small prawns in front of customers, unlike the promise of giving unlimited prawns in advertisements, then the business will not work
" kochar muskaraate hue kehete hai, "dhanani sar ne kaha tha, ham graahakon main khushiyaan baantnaa chaahate hai

 2011 main jab bharat kaa restaraan vyavsaay udaan bharne ke liye taiyaar tha, bibikue ne desh kii ahm jagahon par apni maujuudagi darj kara di thi
 After Dhanani's death in 2012, he was replaced by his brother Qayum

 On the alliance with Congress, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that if there is an alliance, we will campaign
 main mangalvaar se party ke liye prachaar karuunga or shivpal ke liye bhi prachaar karuunga
 It is worth mentioning that after the alliance with SP, Mulayam Singh had recently expressed his displeasure that he will not campaign this time

 2 april ko suraj upar chadha to aam log yahi kayaas laga rahe the ki kuch chote-mote dalit sanghathanon ne bharat band kii apil bhi kii he kya
 These organizations were largely opposing the Supreme Court ruling that came two weeks ago in which the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 were relaxed
 lekin dopaher hote-hote puure desh ko bharat band kii aanch mahasoos hone lagi

 This was an expression of the fear that the various pillars of the "system" are plotting to bring them down again, taking away their constitutional rights
 us din vaaki kuch pradarshnakariyon ko yah kehete suna gaya ki ve desh main "aarakshan vyavastha ko khatm'' karne kii koshish kaa virodh karne sadak par utre hai
 For Dalits this opportunity was like do or die
 dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke professor vivek kumaar kehete hai, "samajashastri or dalit samudaay se hone ke naate main kah saktaa hum ki yah sadiyon se apamaanit or laanchit samudaay ke sanchit gusse kaa izhaar tha
 The social and economic policies of the central government led by Narendra Modi did not make any difference in these circumstances
 notebandi or gorakshakon kii hinsa kii maar sabase adhik haashie par pade dalit samudaay ko jhelni padi
 bjp's Dalit MP Udit Raj believes that there have been many reasons for the anger that emerged on April 2
 ve kehete hai, "is faisle ke pehle ek maamla collejon main essi / asti / obisi logon kii bhartee kaa tha, jisamen aarakshan ko dhilaa kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, there was hardly any recruitment in government jobs, which caused frustration among the Dalit youth
 naukariyon main theka pratha, nijeekaran or vinievesh ne bhi aarakshan ke niyamon main dhilaai ke halaat paidaa kiye
 Apart from this, there were incidents of Rohit Vemula's suicide and harassment like Una, Saharanpur, Koregaon
 in sabhi kaa mila-jula asar ham dekh rahe hai
 Vivek Kumar points out that the April rebellion is also an indication that Dalits are now disenchanted with the "mother-father" culture of political parties — they no longer want to stare at them to raise their issues
 apni chunavi takat ke ehsaas ke saath padhai-likhaai or aarthik udaarikaran se mili shah kii vajah se dalit ab apane saamaajik or rajnatik adhikaron keprati adhik jaagruk ho uthe hai
 Instead of allowing political parties to raise issues, Dalits themselves have started setting the agenda
 dalit aawaaj ekadam saaf or kaaphi mukhar he, jaisaa ki punjab kii dalit kishori ginni maahi apane geet danger chamaar main izhaar karti he
 India got its glimpse in early summer of 2018
 shaayad supreme court 20 march ko "is danger'' kaa andaja nahin laga paaya, jab usne essi-asti utpeeda kanoon ke kai kade praavdhaanon ko dhilaa karne kaa faisla sunaaya
 By considering "abuse cases" on behalf of "vested selfish elements" for political or personal reasons, the Supreme Court imposed several security conditions

 It also said that a government official would have to obtain written approval from the employer before the arrest and from the senior police officer (SSP) in the case of an ordinary citizen

 adaalat bombai hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf maharashtra takneekee shiksha ke nideshak subhash kashinath mahajan kii arji par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 The High Court had dismissed Mahajan's plea challenging the FIR against him for refusing to allow a department official to pursue the case
 vibhaag ke us adhikari ne ek karmchaaree ke kaamkaaj par vaarshik gopneey rapat (asiaar) main pratikul tippanee likhi thi
 However, the case was a court verdict but the anger of the Dalits had to bear the brunt of the ruling BJP in the Center and in twenty states
 sachaai yah he ki centre sarkaar ne sunwaayee ke dauraan utpeeda kanoon main kisi tarah kii dhilaai baratane ke khilaaf baat kii thi
 Additional Advocate General Maninder Singh admitted that the law had been misused, but said that the matter of provision of penalty for false complaints was considered in Parliament
 lekin sarkaar kaa mat tha ki essi-asti samudaay ke logon par dand kaa praavdhaan kanoon kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 He also said that the court should refrain from issuing guidelines on the issue and that the matter is of the legislature
 kendriya saamaajik nyaay or adhikarita mantri thavarchand gahalot kaa daawa he ki aam dharna ke vipareet narendra modi sarkaar ne maujuuda kanoon ke kuch praavdhaanon ko or kadaa kiya he
 For example, three years ago, preventing a Dalit from riding a horse in a procession or shaving his head was made a punishable offense
 haalanki, sarkaar kii ore se iskaa kori santoshjanak jawaab nahin mila ki usne kyon supreme court main is faisle ke khilaaf punarvichaar yachika daayar karne main kareeb do hafte laga die
 On the other hand, the Supreme Court has refused to stay its verdict and said that the order of March 20 was given only to provide protection to innocent people, it does not affect the rights of weaker sections
 haalanki, usne yah bhi kaha ki uske faislon ke khilaaf das din baad agali sunwaayee main vah sabhi pakshon kii daleelein sunegi
 Has the law been misused? The complaint of upper caste people is not new that the Scheduled Castes resort to the Atrocities Act to blackmail them
 tamilnadu main oonchi jati vanniar ke dabadabe vaala pattali makkaal kaachchi varshon se is kanoon ko badalane kii maang kar rahaa he
 Last year, Maratha community members across Maharashtra demonstrated for the demand for reservation, and one of their demands was that the Atrocities Act should be relaxed as many fake cases have been filed against the Marathas
 iske jabaav main maharashtra police ko rajya sarkaar ke paas yah report saunpny padi ki is kanoon ke durupyog kaa koi spasht saboot nahin he
 Udit Raj says, "there is no doubt that many laws have been misused and this law is one of them
" to, supreme court ne duusare kanoonon ke bare main aisi raay kyon nahin di? adaalat ne tisare paksh ko jodakar utpeeda virdohi kanoon ke mul dhaanche ko hi badal diya he
 The Supreme Court while delivering the verdict cited National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data to show its misuse
 adaalat ne kaha ki 2015 main is kanoon ke tahat darj kii gai kul shikayaton main kareeb 15-16 fisadi farji thim or us saal adaalaton ne kareeb 75 fisadi maamalon main rihaai yaa shikaayat vaapasi ke faisle sunaae
 Often, the low rate of punishment under this has been cited as the reason for laxity in the stringent provisions of this law
 tamilnadu main media institute for neshnal deveopment (emandi) trust kii 2015 kii padtaal main paaya gaya ki utpeeda virdohi kanoon ke tahat tees fisadi maamle "tathyon kii gadabadi'' kii vajah se band kiye gaye
 This meant that these disturbances occur at the discretion of the police
 vivek kumaar kehete hai, "durupyog ke ulat sachaai yah he ki is kanoon kaa puri tarah paalan hi nahin ho paata
 This is proved by the high rate of release
 masalan, 1992 ke rajasthan main bhavari devi maamle main adaalat ne ooncha jati ke balaatkaariyon ko yah kahkar reeha kar diya ki ladke apane pita ke saamne aisa kukrity nahin kar sakate
 "other Dalit scholars also agree that the arguments for misuse of the law are exaggerated

 Sanghamitra Sheel Acharya says, "the social background of the victims is different from that of officials who work with their perceptions and prejudices against Dalits
 zyaadaatar maamalon main peedit apane upar atyaachaar karne waalon ke maatahat hote hai
 It is also difficult to lodge complaints due to small social status
 maamalon ko waapas lene ke bhi kai tarah kedbaav kaam karte hai
 So often the release is not because the crime did not happen, but because the social status of fighting the case does not exist
 ''dilli skool of iconomics main samajashaastra kii professor nandini sundar ke mutabik, is kanoon ke tahat darj maamalon kii sankhya se utpeeda kii vaastavik sankhya kaa andaja nahin lagata kyonki "police aksar exiar darj karti hi nahin
 "ultimately, this law is as effective as the police and judiciary and both suffer from systemic bias towards SC-ST," she says
 ''dalit chunavi takatdaliton kii chunavi takat kaaphi ahm he or is saal chaar bade rajyon ke or agle saal loksabhaa ke tay chunaav ke maddenjar koi bhi party unhen naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati
 The bjp's success in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections is a living proof of this
 us dauraan party ke liye dalit vot kii hissedari 2009 ke 12 fisadi se badhkar 24 fisadi ho gai thi
 Out of total 84 Lok Sabha seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, BJP won 40, of which Uttar Pradesh had 17 seats
 centre for studies of develping societes (siesds) ke mutabik, desh bhar main 85 fisadi daliton ne 2000 ke shuruaati varshon main basapa kii bulandi ke dauraan use vot diya tha
 The bsp's Dalit support fell by 23 percentage points in the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 lihaaja, samaajawaadee party kii baari jeet hui
 Then in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Jatav (caste of Mayawati) support of BSP fell by 16 percentage points and support of other Dalit castes by 35 percentage points
 lihaaja, party ko ek bhi seat nahin mili
 The analysis of where non-bjp, non-congress parties won the assembly elections also gives an idea of the role of Dalit votes
 masalan, pashchim bengal main trinmul congress, odisha main biju janata dal or tamilnadu main eiediemke sabhi ko apane-apane rajyon main badi sankhya main dalit vot hasil hue
 In Telangana, a large number of Dalit votes from the Congress went to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and formed its government
 bhaajapa kii chunavi safalataa main dalit voton kii ahmiyat rahi he to bihar or dilli main uske kharaab pradarshan kii bhi vajah dalit voton kaa khisakna rahi he
 Many BJP leaders agree that the bjp's plight in the state led to a statement reviewing reservation by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat just before the Bihar elections
 ab dalit utpeeda ke badhate maamalon or adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf dalit samudaay main naaraazgi badi to vipakshi partiyon ko bhaajapa se dalit vot bank main send lagane kaa mauka najar aayaa
 The immediate ground for this battle will be the elections of four major states Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to be held this year
 inamen dalit aabaadi lagbhag 19 fisadi he
 Sociologist Dipankar Gupta says, "dalits do not vote outright under normal circumstances, but when an issue affects them in a big way it creates the same effect across the country
 gujarat main daliton ke saath jo hua, uskaa asar nishchit rup se uttar pradesh yaa bihar main padegaa
 Naturally, all parties are trying to cash in on this issue as it will unite the Dalit vote
 ''javaabi hamaledalit aakrosh se nibatane main naakaam rahane par oonchi jatiyon ne ugr javaabi hamale karnaa shuru kar diya
 Often this results in violence and public humiliation
 masalan, dalit virodh ke ek din baad rajasthan main hinsa bhadak uthi
 a mob of about 5,000 set fire to the homes of one sitting and one former Dalit MLA
 daliton kii moonch rakhane, apni jati se baahar shaadi karne, baraat main ghodi chadhgaye or aisi hi vibhinn prakaar kii gatividhiyon par hatyaein ho rahi hai, jinhen maujuuda saamaajik vyavastha main galat mana jaataa he
 The Supreme Court verdict may have come like an immediate chinkari, but resentment was brewing for some time
 jaisaa ki janvari, 2016 main dalit piechdi chaatr rohit vemula kii khudakushi main jaahir hua tha
 This led to a series of demonstrations against institutional caste discrimination in many university campuses across the country
 july, 2016 main gujarat ke una main gorakshakon dwaara chaar dalit yuvakon kii pitayee se bhi desh bhar main vyapak pradarshan hue the

 The minister also apologized later but staying in controversy has become his pastime

 Ramdas Athawale, the most well-known Dalit face of the Modi cabinet, has also lashed out at the government for not making public the 2011 census's caste census data
 endie sarkaar ko abhi in aankadon ko saarvajanik karnaa baaki he jabaki vah do saal pehle hi janaganana ke gramin or shahari saamaajik-aarthik suchakank jari kar chuki he
 Dalit struggle continues: Not only the caste figures, but the struggle of Ambedkar's legacy and the court's decision, the socio-economic condition of the Dalits has been lost in the country
 raajnneetik dalon ke chunavi bhavishya ko prabhavit karne kii daliton kii kaabiliyat—khaastaur par uttar pradesh, punjab, bihar or madhya pradesh jaise rajyon main—ne bhi sunishchit kiya he ki partiyaan niyamit taur par inke prati apni aasthaa dikhaati rahen
 But the gap between the social deposit and the socio-economic reality of the country has brought the social struggle to the present day

 For example — a recent report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows that crime against Dalits in Uttar Pradesh increased by 25 per cent between 2015 and 2016, which is the highest in the country as against the national average of 5 per cent in the same period

 After which the actress decided not to calm down and expose the wanted policeman

 Shikha researched about that person and found that this manchala is an officer of Maharashtra Police

 He lives in Thane, a police officer and is an officer of RTO

 The Shiv Sena, which has found its identity in the government of Maharashtra, has suddenly taken an aggressive stand

 uddhav apane pita swargeey bal thakare kii sikh par bani film ke premier ke baad samvaadadaataaon se baat kar rahe the
 On this occasion, Uddhav even said that i know when and how to give birthright
 maharashtra main shivasena ke 63 vidhayak hai
 With his support, the BJP government of Maharashtra with 122 mlas was able to cross the majority mark
 iske badale shivasena ko 10 mantripad mili hai, lekin shivasena sarkaar main apni pahchaan nahin bana saki he
 Recently, Shiv Sena leader and environment minister Ramdas Kadam, who has fought with BJP over changes in environmental law, once again targeted his own government
 rajya ke paryaavaran mantri ne mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis par gambhir aarope rajya madh diya he
 Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam has said to leave the earning of the current CM2 number
 iske alaava vah mumbai main marathi nanus ko saste ghar dilaaein
 Chief Minister Fadnavis is currently in Davos, Switzerland to participate in the World Economic Forum
 vaise in bayanon se maharashtra kii bijepi or shivasena sarkaar ke bich kaa asamanjas khulkar saamne aayaa he
 This can prove to be a danger bell for the BJP

 If the ICC were to ban Dhoni for two odis, he would not be able to play big World Cup matches against South Africa and Australia

 8 runs were needed from 3 balls to win
 dhoni ke out hone ke baad mishael centner ballebaaji ke liye aae
 At the time, Rajasthan Royals bowler Ben Stokes was bowling

 Earlier, Chennai once again put on a brilliant bowling display, stopping the Royals for 151 runs for seven wickets

 iske alaava pradesh main kisaanon ko jaagruk karne kaa jimmaa tandurust punjab mishan ke tahat bhi chalaaya ja rahaa he
 In the early stages of paddy harvesting, it was felt that the farmers had stopped burning the straw, but as the sowing of new crop is coming closer, the incidents of burning straw in the fields have increased

 congress saansad evam lekhak shashi tharur ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue aaj kaha ki modi desh ke samvidhan ko pavitra to kehete hai, lekin vah hindutv ke purodha pandit deen dayaal upaadhyaay ko nayak ke taur par saraahte bhi hai
 He said that both things cannot go together
 jaipur saahityotsav main 61 saal ke tharur ne kaha ki hinduon ko uth khadey hone or yah samajhane kii sakht jarurat he ki unke naam par kya kiya ja rahaa he or iske khilaaf bolne kii jarurat he
 Former Union Minister Tharoor said, 'we need to call right as right and wrong as wrong
 ham aise desh main rah rahe hai jahaan ek taraf to pradhanmantri kehete hai ki samvidhan pavitra granth he or duusari taraf vah ek nayak ke taur par prashansa karte hai or apane mantralayon ko nirdesh dete hai ki ve us deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke kaaryon, lekhan evam shikshan ko padhen or padhaaen jo saaf taur par samvidhan ko khaarij karte hai or jo kehete hai ki samvidhan mul rup se trutipurna he
 Both views are contradictory
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ek hi vaakya main aapke ye donon vichaar nahin ho sakate
 It bothers me to be both and to leave it just like this for a long time in our public discourse
 ’ diggi pales main ho rahe jaipur saahityotsav main tharur ne kaha ki upaadhyaay kaa maananaa tha ki samvidhan ‘is trutipurna dharna par tikaa he ki raashtra bharat kaa ek bhu-bhaag he or saare log isamen hai
 'tharoorne said,' While he (upadhyay) says that it is not right, the nation is not a landmass, it is a people and therefore a Hindu people
 iskaa matlab he ki aapako hindu raashtra chahie or samvidhan main yah jhalakana chahie, lekin usamen to ye baaten he hi nahin
 He said that this is the biggest contradiction
 unhone kaha, ‘aap ek hi samay main upaadhyaay or samvidhan kii tarif nahin kar sakate
 Tharoor, MP from Thiruvananthapuram, described himself as a 'devotee' of Swami Vivekananda's teachings and said that it is in the heart of Hinduism to accept differences

 46,888 maweshiyon maare gaye or 915,878 makaan dhwast yaa kshatigrast ho gaye
 At the same time, 1487 people and 41,965 cattle were killed in the 2017 natural disasters
 jabaki, 546,518 makaan dhwast yaa kshatigrast ho gaye
 The last four months of 2018 were the most disturbing cyclonic storms
 pichley saal sabase zyada 7 chakravaati tufaan aae
 In the year 2018, 2 cyclones occurred in May, 1 in September, 2 in October, 1 in November and 1 in December
 19 sitambar ko pashchim bengal main aae chakravaati tufaan de se 25 logon kii maut hui

 Cyclonic storms that hit North India in the last year are given numbers, not just names
 inhen kam dabaav vaala tufaan kehete hai
 The bob 03 cyclonic storm on 26 July 2018 caused heavy rains in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi
 sabase zyada barish 226 mimi meerut main darj kii gai
 69 people died in UP
 jabaki, dilli main 1500 logon ko surakshit sthanon par pahunchaaya gaya
 This was followed by BOB 05 in August and BOB 06 in September

 But they are most affected on the coasts of West Bengal and Bangladesh
 chakravaat ko or khatarnaak banaata he us vakt uthne vaali oonchi lehren
 However, the west coast of India is quieter than the east coast
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik bengal kii khadi par banane vaale chakravaati tufaan yaa to bengal kii khadi ke dakshin purv main banate hai yaa uttar pashchim prashanth sagar par banane vaale chakravaati tufaan ke ansh hote hai, jo hind mahaasaagar kii ore badhate hai
 The storms that form over the North West Pacific Sea are higher than the global average, so there are more storms over the Bay of Bengal
 vahiin, arab sagar par banane vaale chakravaati tufaan yaa to dakshin purv arab sagar par banate hai yaa bengal kii khadi par banane vaale chakravaati tufaan ke ansh hote hai
 Because the storms on the Bay of Bengal weaken after hitting the ground, it is rare that they reach the Arabian Sea
 bengal kii khadi kii tulana main arab sagar zyada shantbengal kii khadi kii tulana main arab sagar thanda he isliye is par adhik tufaan nahin aate
 There are three types of danger from storms, heavy rain, strong winds and high waves
 in teenon main sabase khatarnaak oonchi lehren hi hai
 The danger of high waves rising on the west coast around Gujarat is low
 purvi tat par ham jaise-jaise tamilnadu se upar andhra pradesh, odisha or pa
 When we move towards Bengal, this danger increases

 chaatra ke pita ne jab skool ko chitthee bhejkar kaaran jaananaa chaha to skool prabandhan ne likhit jawaab main kaha ki is vishay par sawaal naa karen or agar dikkat he to chaatra kaa daakhila kisi islamic skool main kara den
 This decree of the school is not embracing the student's father
 skool ne chaatra ke pita ko apni dress code kaa hawala dete hue kisi bhi prakaar kii chhot dene se inkaar karte hue bevajaah prashn nahin karne ke liye kaha he
 The incident took place at Anand Bhawan School in Kotwali area of barabanki

 skool ke is farmaan par chaatra ke pita rizvi ne kaha ki yah skool alpsankhyakon kaa mana jaataa he or isamen zyaadaatar shikshak or staff isaai dharm ke maanane vaale hai
 According to Rizvi, at a certain age in Islam, compulsions compel scarves to wear a headscarf to cover their heads and hence my daughter went to school with a scarf on her head
 isi mudde par jab skool kii pradhanacharya se baat kii gai to unhone kaha ki hamaara iraadaa kisi dharm ke vyakti kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaana nahin tha

 nichali adaalaton main saalon saal se lambit maamalon kii teji se sunwaayee kii maang ko lekar vichaaradhin kaidiyon kii taraf se bheje gaye ek khat ko dilli hoicourt ne janhit yachika main tabdeel kar diya he
 The Bench of Delhi High Court Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice AJ Bhimbani has issued a notice to the Delhi government seeking an answer
 hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar ko nirdesh diya he ki 13 agast tak wo is par apana jawaab daakhil kare
 In fact, the Delhi High Court received a letter sometime back from five undertrials
 is khat main vichaaradhin kaidiyon ne apni shikaayat main bataaya ki lambey vakt se unhen giraftaar karne ke baad unke cese main kai baras bitne ke baad bhi kuch nahin ho paaya he
 Taking cognizance of the letter sent, the High Court has now considered it to be a public interest petition considering the need for a hearing
 5 saal baad bhi aarope tay nahindilli hoicourt ko ye khat likhane vaale kaidiyon main ek kaidi ujair ahamed ko rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ne 2013 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or vah pichley paanch saal se rohinee jail main band hai
 Uzair has written in his letter to the Delhi High Court that he has been implicated in a false case
 ujair dwaara jo aarope lagaae gaye hai vah behad gambhir hai
 Even after 5 years, no charges have been framed against him in the court so far
 july 2016 se tihaad jail main band imran khan ne bhi hoicourt ko likhe apane khat main bataaya he ki use enie ne giraftaar kiya tha or uske khilaaf jaanch agency ne july 2016 main hi chargeshit daakhil kar di thi, lekin tab se ab tak uske cese main kuch nahin ho sakaa he
 Apart from this, three more prisoners writing letters to the High Court have also been lodged in jails since 2014 and so far nothing special has happened in the court in their cases
 yun to puure desh main hi jelon kii sthiti behad kharaab he or jelon main kshamta se adhik kaidi hai
 The same situation is in Tihar Jail in the capital Delhi

 The largest number of these prisoners is the undertrials

 In the midst of the overwhelming enthusiasm for the Gujarat elections, Union Food and Supplies Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has given a statement that Modi can use as an anti-government weapon
 darasal, pyaaj kii aasmaan chooti keemton ke bare main jab paswan se poocha gaya ki pyaaj kii keemten kab kam hongi to ramvilas paswan ne kah diya ki 'pyaaj kii keemten kam karnaa unke haath main nahin he
 'customers in Delhi and many other metros are paying Rs 60 to Rs 80 for a kilo of onions, while onions were being sold for 25 to 35 kg a year at the same time last year
 tamaato kii keemten bhi bekaabu ho rahi hai
 Opponents are also attacking the Modi government over the prices of onions and tomatoes
 buudhvaar ko hi congress ke netaa kapil sibbal ne twit karke tanj kasate hue kaha tha ki pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bik rahaa pyaaj aam logon ke aankh main aansu laa rahaa he, lekin modi ivaanka trump se saath mek in india kii baat kar rahe hai or shaayad ye bhul gaye hai ki aansu bhi bharat ke logon ke hi nikal rahe hai
 When onion tomato prices rose, on Wednesday, Ram Vilas Paswan convened a meeting of all the concerned officials to find out why the prices were continuously increasing
 baithak ke baad paswan ne keemten badhane ke liye kai vajahen bataayin
 For example, the highest onion-producing Maharashtra and Karnataka have reduced yields this year
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki keemton par lagaam lagane ke liye sarkaar ne pyaaj kaa niryaat roak diya he or maang ko puraa karne ke liye pyaaj kaa aayaat bhi kiya gaya he
 But Paswan admitted that it would take more than a month to reach the imported onion market
 ramvilas paswan ko ye shikaayat bhi thi ki dilli ke pasrajasthan ke alvar mempyaaj 28 rupee kilo mil rahaa he
 Similarly, onion is being sold at the rate of 30 rupees forts in the market of Nashik, Maharashtra, but the price of this onion is more than doubled in reaching the customers
 paswan ne ye bhi kaha ki kendra sarkaar rajya sarkaron se bhi baat kar rahi he taaki sarkaar mandiyon se sidhe pyaaj kharid kar graahakon tak pahunchaa sake
 He also hoped that the new onion crop will come in two to three weeks and that will also make a difference in prices
 lekin jab paswan se sidhe ye poocha gaya ki sarkaar pyaaj kii keemten kam karne ke liye jo bhi upaay kar rahi he, uskaa asar graahakon ko kab tak dikhegaa, to paswan jhunjhala kar bol pade ki pyaaj kii keemten kam karnaa unke haath main nahin he
 How onion has become a problem for the government, it became even more clear when Aaj Tak asked Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh about the prices of onion, he started giving information about milk production to avoid the question

 kya ajmer main khwaja kaa darbar film hit karaane kii jagah he? ye sawaal uthaaya he ki dargah ke dewan ne
 Diwan Jainual Abedin has pulled the film stars coming to Ajmer, saying that the Dargah is not a place to pray for the success of a film, nor are the films a hit with Khwaja's Dua
 ajmer ke khwaja garib navaj kii dargah par ab filmi sitaron ko film kii kamyaabi kii dua maangane kii ijaajat nahin milegi
 a few days later there may be no entry of stars at the rate of Khwaj
 dargah sharif ke dewan ne kaha he ki dargah jiyaarat kii jagah he, filmon kii kamyaabi kii duaen maangane kii nahin
 However, the Anjuman Dargah, the organization of the khadim in the dargah, does not agree with this statement
 khadimon kaa kahana he ki khwaja kaa darbar sabake liye khulaa he
 The Diwan of the dargah says that someone may come to ask for blessings at Khwaja's rate, but pray for the family and ask for it
 filmon ke liye dua naa maangi jaae kyonki filmein ashleelata failaati hai
 But the Khadim of the Dargah do not believe that it is right to stop anyone from visiting the Dargah
 agar rojaanaa kii daudbhag main akhbaar nahin pard paa rahe hai, to aapke liye 'aaj tak' laayaa he kuch khaas

 How will you work as a judge? How will your court work? Judge and court are big words
 ham bade simple log hai
 We are reviving our eternal justice system which was suppressed
 jaise maryaada purushottam ram nyaay kiya karte the
 Just like in our Narada Samhita, the judge should be
 jaise manusmriti main nyaay ke tareeke hai unheen paddati ko apanaate hue yah kaam karenge
