 Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, playing crores on one side, and a man living on the sidewalk
 ek taraf duniya ko sadachaar or prem kii sikh denevaale asaram or duusari taraf jinda rahane kii jaddojahad main logon se bheekh maangata ek insaan
 But everyday, laying the ground and covering the sky, the secret of Asaram and Narayan Sai is buried in the chest of this person, who in this world no one knows except the three
 ab aap puuchhenge ki bhala footpath par bheekh maanganevaale is garib ke saath asaram kaa aisa koun sa rishta ho saktaa he, jo ye asaram or narayan sai ko itane kareeb se jaanata he
 Actually, this person who lives in Muflissi is none other than Vinod Sirumalani, Asaram's real nephew
 bhatija, yani asaram ke sage bade bhai jetharam sirumalani kaa betaa
 Vinod Sirumalani
 lekin ab sawaal yah he ki aakhir ek itane bade or amir shaks ke bhattije kii haalat aisi kaise ho sakati he ki use jeene ke liye logon se bheekh maangani pade? to, is sawaal ke jawaab main bhi asaram kii wo haqikat chhipi he, jise jaanane ke baad koi bhi sharmasaar ho jayega
 Believe the words of this man, his family once played in lakhs and his life was also good, but it is Asaram who brought his entire family on the road
 asaram ne dhokhe se apane hi bade bhai jaaydaad hadap lee or isse pehle ki wo sanbhal pate, unka puraa parivaar sadak par aa gaya
 This was the reason that Asaram's elder brother himself had told his son to never forgive Asaram before his death, but with the help of luck and tricks, Asaram not only silenced everyone but his own nephew was the only one in the streets
 Arrived at footpath par ji rahe asaram ke bhattije vinod sirumalani kaa kabhi bharaapura parivaar hua karata tha
 He also had a love marriage with a girl of his choice and had his name and his wife's name on his arm as a token of love, but in the presence of his own uncle Asaram himself, Vinod's fortune was such that he was angry Nobody lives anywhere
 uske pita kii maut ho gai, ghar-baar chhin gaya or bivi asaram ke paas chali gai
 Yes, near the same Asaram, who was Vinod's uncle to say, but if Vinod believed, the same uncle taught his wife Komal such a bandage that she never returned
 vinod kii maane to asaram ke sammohan kii koi aisi vidya he, jiske chalate jab ladkiyaan unki taraf dekhati hai, to phir wo unheen kii divaani ho kar rah jaati he or uski patni bhi asaram kii isi gupt vidya kii shikaar ban gai
 Vinod says that he does not know where his wife is today, but he still loves her desperately
 vaise vinod kii in ankhon ne sirf apane or apane parivaar kii barbaadi hi nahin dekhi
 Along with Asaram, he also saw the acts of Narayan Sai, which would make it difficult for anyone to believe his ears
 vinod kahata he ki narayan sai ko logon ke kapade utaarne kaa bada shauk he or to or narayan ke bachapan ke ek baar khud uske bhi kapade utaarne kii koshish kii thi
 Vinod's life should no longer be confined to these pieces, but his eyes have seen the truth of Asaram and Narayan Sai, which is shocking
 vinod ne sirf apni patni ko asaram ke paas jate hue nahin dekha, balki kabhi asaram ke ashram main rahane ke dauraan usne kai or ladakiyon ko bhi asaram kaa shikaar banate hue dekha tha
 Of course, Vinod's eyes are matched by the complaints of other girls and old seekers who have spoken against Asaram and since Vinod himself is Asaram's real nephew, his talk weighs even more

 ankiv ne bataaya ki unhone thiruvallur uniwarsity se 2013-2016 ke bich grajuation puri kii
 When he was asked about the subject of graduation, he could tell only about English
 unhone bataaya, 'english or skill besd subjects meri praathamikta main rahete the or unamem mere number bhi thik hai
 'could not tell the teacher's name, however, which teachers taught him in graduation, Ankiv could not tell anything about it
 unhone kaha, 'echodi (HOD) yaa teacher kaa naam dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he, jaise hi yaad aayega bataaungaa

 aisa nahin tha ki puure time vahiin rahaa

 Lalu and the opposition are considering the presence of leaders and representatives of all 17 small parties, including jdu's rebellious leader Sharad Yadav, a big success, but in the wake of 2019, many questions are still to be answered in the face of opposition hopes of the grand alliance

 haalanki, ye safai di gayi ki sonia beemaari ke chalate nahin aa paayin, isiilie unka recorded bhaashan raily main chalaaya gaya
 At the same time, Rahul had to go on the invitation of the Norwegian government, so he could not come
 haalanki pehle hi rahul apana likhit samarthan kaa patr bhej chuke the
 By the way, it is also not hidden that due to tearing of Rahul's ordinance, Lalu till date cannot contest
 bihar chunaavon ke dauraan bhi rahul ne lalu ke saath manch saajha nahin kiya tha
 Overall, whatever the reasons, the presence of one Gandhi from the Congress in Lalu's rally could have strengthened the opposition unity, but it could not happen

 Despite Mulayam's statement, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh participated in a rally called amidst the grand alliance, but his silence on the alliance revealed that there are many obstacles in the path of the grand alliance
 ensipi se tariq anwar aaye, sharad pavaar or prafull rahe dooryah kaha ja saktaa he ki ensipi main tariq anwar kii haisiyat waisi hi he, jo kabhi sharad yadav kii jediu main thi
 The four big faces of NCP are Sharad Pawar, Praful Patel, Supriya Sule and Ajit Pawar, who missed the rally
 tariq bihar se hi saansad hai or wo muslim bhi hai
 So, even though he has been there, it cannot be guaranteed to remain in the grand alliance of NCP in future

 After this, the NCP distanced itself from the opposition meeting recently
 haal main gujarat congress ne ensipi ko bijepi kii bi team bataakar gujarat main usase gathbandhan nahin karne kaa elaan tak kar diya
 Overall, an analysis of the picture of opposition unity that has emerged in Lalu's Maharali in Patna reveals that there are many unresolved questions in the way of 2019 Mahagathjod, which leaders are expected to answer as soon as possible
 Will have to be resolved

 'change happens very slowly in Bengal

 Has an anti-incumbency wave been prepared against TMC? On this question, Amit Shah said, 'people had brought TMC with a lot of expectations, but not meeting the expectation soon led to disappointment in the people, and this disappointment will lead to the removal of Mamta Banerjee today
 is
 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ko kankad vaali mithai bhejne ke mamata banerjee ke bayaan par amit shah ne kaha, 'ham kankad nahin bhejte, kankad bhejnaa inkaa (mamata banerjee) kaa nechar he

 During the visit of US President Barack Obama, Parliament mps of various political parties have been advised to behave 'decently'
 spikar karyaalay sutron ne isaki pushti karte hue kaha ki spikar karyaalay ne nahin balki sansadeey kaary mantralay ne yah salaah di he
 Significantly, after President Bill Clinton addressed Members of Parliament in the year 2000, the behavior of mps was severely criticized
 loksabhaa main mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa ke ek varisht sadsy ajarun ram meghavaal ne bhashaa ko bataaya ki sansadeey kaary mantralay kii ore se sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ko pichley dinon salaah patr jari kiya gaya jisamen spasht taur par kaha gaya he ki america raashtrapati baraak obama ke sansad aagaman or vishesh rup se donon sadanon ke sadasyon ko sambodhit kiye jane ke dauraan sadsy ‘shaleenta’ se pesh aaen or ‘shishtachar’ ko banaae rakhen
 This advice letter has been issued to party leaders
 unase yah sunishchit karaane ko kaha gaya he ki sambandhit dalon ke saansad sadan main shaleenta banaaen rakhen tathaa unka aacharan sansad kii garima ko badhaane vaala ho
 Earlier, the Speaker's office was likely to issue such guidelines to mps, but Speaker Meira Kumar refused to issue directions, saying mps would feel hurt
 unka kahana tha ki saansad paripakv or anbhavi hai tathaa unhen pataa he ki kis tarah se pesh aana he
 Speakers' office sources, however, admitted that after some reports in the media about the behavior of lawmakers during Clinton's visit, the speaker had seen a video recording of Clinton's address
 sutron ne bataaya ki video ricarding se spikar yah dekhnaa chaahati thim ki saansadon ke aacharan main kahin kuch aapattijanak tha yaa nahin
 Marxist MP MB Rajesh, while contacting Palakkad over phone, denied having any such instructions, saying that he could get detailed information in this regard only after reaching Delhi tomorrow
 lekin abhi tak party kii ore se aisa koi nirdesh unhen nahin mila he
 When asked by a party leader whether mps would not be able to join hands with the US President in the wake of these directives, as happened during former US President Bill Clinton's visit to Parliament, he declined to comment
 pichley dinon spikar mira kumaar ne ek saakshaatkaar main aise koi disha nirdesh jari kiye jane kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue kaha tha ki aisa kadam uthaane kii koi jarurat nahin he or unhen vishwaas he ki saansad behatar tareeke se pesh aaenge
 It is notable that after the address of former US President Bill Clinton to the mps, there was a lot of chaos in Central Hall
 loksabhaa sachivalay ke ricard tak main yah baat darj he ki us samay teen sau saansadon ne clinton se haath milaayaa tha

 On 27 January 2050, it was appropriate that this announcement be made in Nagpur, the capital of the Vidarbha state
 varsh 2025 main duusare rajya punargathan ayog ne bharat ko 50 rajyon main baant diya
 Nagpur and Vidarbha are right in the middle of the country
 rajya punargathan ayog kii report ke baad do bade nirnay liye gaye
 First, the Prime Minister will no longer deliver the Independence Day speech from the Red Fort in Delhi
 na hi ganatantr diwas kii parade sirf dilli main yojit kii jaaegi
 Instead, they will be done in different cities every time
 is nirnay ko pehali baar varsh 2040 main lagu kiya gaya, jab bharat kii shahari jansankhya 50 fisadi ko paar kar gai
 Second, now ministers will not inaugurate, give speeches, and tour disrupting normal life during the day
 varsh 2030 main ek piiel daakhil hone ke baad supreme court ke nirdesh se is tarah kii sabhi awajahi ab raat main hoti he or sabhi kaarykram aadhi raat ko yojit kiye jate hai
 However, yesterday's Republic Day celebrations were somewhat different
 pathakon ko yaad hoga ki jab 15 agast, 2047 ko aazaadee ke 100 saal puraa hone kaa samaaroh manaaya gaya tha, tab hi yah nirnay liya gaya tha ki pradhanmantri madhya raatri kaa bhaashan ab 15 agast kii jagah 26 janvari ko denge
 It was implemented from 2048 itself, but on January 26, 2050, when 100 years of the Republic of India were completed, it was for the first time that the Prime Minister himself was not present to give a speech
 isaki jagah bharat ke bichombich miles stone par bane nae kanvension centre main unki holographic image pesh kii gai
 In his speech, the Prime Minister cited a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
 varsh 2040 main bharat ke oisidi kaa sadsy banane ke baad iskaa mukhyalay paris se hataakar nai dilli kar diya gaya
 According to its new report, in 2050, India has become the world's largest economy, overtaking China in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
 is report main iemef or vishwa bank ke aankade istemaal kiye gaye hai
 India has become the second economy in the world, surpassing the US in terms of nominal exchange rate
 iskaa matlab yah he ki america dollar bharat ke rupye ke mukaable kamjor ho gaya
 With the nominal exchange rate, India's per capita income has now reached $ 20,000
 yaad karen ki paanch saal pehle yuandipi kii maanav vikaas report main yah sanket diya gaya tha ki bharat kaa maanav vikaas suchakank 0
 It has crossed the limit of 9, making this country in the line of top countries with high human development development category
 desh main praudh sakshartaa dar badhkar 95 fisadi or navjaat shishu mrityu dar ghatakar paanch prati hajaar tak pahunch gai he
 After broadening the terms of reference of the 16th Finance Commission, the Planning Commission has been abolished
 yojana banane or bipiel vaale logon ke pahchaan kaary ko ab vikendrit kar diya gaya he
 In this way the NSS still collects data (now large samples are taken every year) but there is no specific number for what percentage of the population is below the poverty line
 eneses ke aankadon ke aadhaar par vibhinn log aankadon kii gananaa ke liye vibhinn garibi rekha kaa istemaal karte hai
 However, the poverty range is 2 to 5 percent
 ham yah jaanate hai ki antim ashikshit praudh mahila ko 2049 main sakshar bana diya gaya he or use kal ganatantr diwas samaaroh main ek aword diya gaya
 However, opposition leaders did not delay criticism of the Prime Minister's speech, arguing that the government was trying to hide the problems
 udhaaharan ke liye, rupaya-dollar vinium dar 10 rupee prati dollar tak pahunch gai he or bharat ke chaalu khaataa adhishesh or baari puunji khaataa pravaah ko dekhte hue rupye kii or majbootee ko rokna asambhav jaisaa he, jisase niryaat gaiyr pratispardhi hota ja rahaa he
 The real GDP growth has been over 9 per cent for the last three decades, making it difficult for Indian embassies to handle 40 million visa applications every year, of which 5 million are for immigration
 har saal kareeb 2,00,000 chaatr bharat main padhai ke liye aavedan karte hai
 Many remain here illegally
 videshi companiyon par bhi work permit niyamon ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagata rahaa he
 In the year 2040, 70 lakh 'illegal' immigrants have been legalized
 lekin bahut se log chintaa jataate hai ki isse bhartiya samskruti or suraksha daanv par lag rahi he
 After the border agreement with China, an agreement has been reached with it to allow free cross-border movement of capital and workers
 seemaa vivaad ke mudde ko bharat alag-thalag tareeke se nahin nibata saktaa tha
 a joint india-china Working Group has been formed to determine the common position of the two countries
 pashchimi desh bharat or china par gutbaji karne kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai, khaskar ek chini ke vishwa bank adhyaksh banane or ek bhartiya ke antarrashtriya mudra kosh (iemef) kaa managing diarector banane ke baad
 The India and China sides will be decided after taking feedback from other neighboring countries of South Asia and East Asia as both major economies have been integrated with other economies in the region
 pakistan ke ravaie kii vajah se yah or bhi jatil maamla ho gaya he kyonki pakistan abhi tak bharat ko menen kaa darja dene se inkaar karata rahaa he
 But now Pakistan is a union of four provinces and this is more problem for Punjab and Sindh, not for the other two states
 vipaksh ne sarkaar kii is baat ke liye bhi aalochana kii he ki usne varsh 2048 ke samar olympic ke lekha-jokha ko abhi tak antim rup nahin diya he, jiskaa bharat ne aayojan kiya tha

 (input bhashaa se) a UK court on Wednesday extended the custody of fugitive diamond trader Nirav Modi during a hearing and asked him to appear in jail from January 2 via video link
 neerav modi punjab neshnal bank ke saath do arab dollar kii dhokhadhadi or mani londring maamle main pratyrpan karrwai se bachane ke liye ladaai lard rahaa he
 Nirav Modi appeared in Westminster Magistrate's Court for his 28-day "preliminary hearing" from London's Wandsworth Jail
 nyaayadhish gareth branston ne phir se pushti kii he ki pratyrpan par sunwaayee agle saal 11 may ko shuru hogi or yah paanch din chalegi
 The judge has also ruled that Nirav Modi will appear on January 2, 2020 via video link
 is bich , use 28 din har roj adaalat ke saamne aana hoga
 Nirav had last month filed a bail application guaranteeing his stay under house arrest
 yah ek abhootpurv peshkash thi kyonki aatankwaad ke maamalon main sandigdh vyaktiyon ko is prakaar niruddh kiya jaataa he
 Nirav Modi also said that his mental health deteriorated after being arrested in Wandsworth Jail after being arrested in March
 nyaayadhish emma arbathanot ne chah november ko kaha tha ki 'ateet se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhavishya main kya ho saktaa he
 The uk's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that earlier this year the High Court of Britain had rejected Nirav Modi's petition, so there was no possibility of an appeal for bail in the High Court
 sipies ke pravaktaa ne kaha , "aap sirf ek baar apil kar sakate hai or baar-baar apil nahin kar sakate hai
 Meanwhile, Nirav Modi will have to appear in Westminster magistrate court for a "preliminary" hearing until the extradition trial hearing early next year
 neerav modi ne dhokhadhadi or mani londring ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya tha
 The defense, led by Hugo Keith, has claimed that the Indian government wrongly promoted Nirav Modi's name as a 'world-renowned scamster' and 'tarnished' it
 neerav ke vakeelon ne nai jamaanat yachika ke liye jaruri paristhitiyon main badlaav ke hisse ke rup main purv main 20 lakh pound kii guarantee kii jagah 40 lakh pound dene peshkash kii thi
 He told the court that his client was also attacked by fellow prisoners
 neerav modi ke vakeelon ne adaalat se shikaayat kii he ki neerav ke maansik swasthya ko lekar doctor kii report li kii gayi he or isamen bharat kaa haath he
 The judge said that if the source of this leak really came to India, it would affect the confidence of the court towards it
 lekin bharat kii ore se khadey britain kii abhiyojna seva ke vakeelon ne bhi is tarah ke li par chintaa jataai par kaha ki isamen bharat kaa koi haath nahin he
 Nirav Modi is in Wandsworth Jail in south-west London after his arrest on 19 March

 a post shared by Bigg Boss 12(@biggboss_khabri) on Dec 6, 2018 at 8:54am PSTA post shared by Colors TV (@colorstv) on Dec 6, 2018 at 9:35pm PST No matter how much poverty and inflation can be seen everywhere in the country, but the Planning Commission has shown the right to reduce poverty in the country only through its figures
 naye aankadon ke mutabik desh kii aabaadi main garibon kaa anupaat 2011-12 main ghatakar 21
 At 9 percent
 yah 2004-05 main 37
 Was at 2 percent
 yojana ayog ne ek prakaar se apane purv ke vivaadaaspad garibi gananaa ke tareeke ke aadhaar par hi yah aankada nikaala he
 According to the Planning Commission, under the Tendulkar system, people consuming less than Rs 816 per person per month in rural areas in 2011-12 were below the poverty line
 shaharon main rashtriya garibi kii rekha kaa paimaana 1,000 rupee prati vyakti prati maah kaa upbhog he
 This means that 33 on goods and services per day in cities
 33 rupee se adhik kharch karne vaala or gramin ilaakon main 27
 a person spending 20 rupees is not poor
 isse pehle ayog ne kaha tha ki shahari ilaakon main pratidin 32 rupee se adhik kharch karne vaala vyakti garib nahin he
 a lot of controversy was generated by his calculation
 yojana ayog ne jo garibi kaa aankada diya he, vah usee gananaa ke tareeke par aadhaarit he
 It says that the number of poor in the country has decreased in the last seven years
 ayog ne kaha ki paanch vyaktiyon ke parivaar main khapat kharch ke hisaab se akhil bhartiya garibi kii rekha gramin ilaakon ke liye 4,080 rupee masik or shaharon main 5,000 rupee masik hogi
 However, the poverty line will vary from state to state

 You will save your mother or girlfriend in the event of a terrible fire
 
 
 ? yah uljhane vaala sawaal china main rashtriya nyaayik pariksha de rahe lakhon prashikshu vakeelon or jajon se poocha gaya, taaki jaancha ja sake ki ve china main kanoon ke kshetra main kaam karne yogya hai yaa nahin
 The question was asked something like, "if a man could have saved his mother, but instead saves his girlfriend, is he committing the crime of not performing duty
" 
 
 ?" Paper-2 dealt with multiple-choice questions, which related to substance abuse laws, roads, pollution, fraud, bribery, murder and other serious offenses, but in question no
 52 regarding 'offenses related to defaults' Asked, for which questions were raised about different fictional incidents, including lifeguards failing to save a drowning child, the husband's refusal of his wife during the divorce process Decided to save not had to and include things like giving a drink poisonous coffee to your friends
 vikalp 'si' main ek vyakti ke bare main bataaya gaya he, jo ek jalati imaarat main se apni maa kii jagah apni garlfriend ko bachaane kaa faisla karata he, or kaha gaya ki uski yah harakat aapraadhik he
 Although the exam asked for water at the site of the fire, another hypothetical question similar to this was asked about who you would choose to save from a drowning mother and girlfriend
 
 
 yah ek aisa sawaal he, jo aamtaur par duniyabar main garlfriend apane-apane bwoyfriend se puuchhati hai, jiske baad unki haalat 'saanp ke munh main chhachhundar' jaisi ho jaati he
 According to 'global Times', the Ministry of Justice published answers on September 24, according to which the person is guilty of not performing duty if he chooses a girlfriend
 haalanki china ke kanoonon ke anusaar, ek putr ko apni maa ko hi bachaana hoga, garlfriend ko nahin, lekin is sawaal ne soshal media par ek nai bahes ko janm diya, jisamen kuch log jawaab se puri tarah sahamat dikhe, or kaha ki maa ko khatre main chhod dena nishthurataa hoga
 One said on social media, "I will save my mother first
 
 
 kanoon ke alaava bhi unhone hi mujhe paala-posa, bada kiya
 
 
 Apart from this, my girlfriend is younger, so the chances of her coming out of the fire on her own are more than that of her mother
 
 
 " On the other hand, some people did not appear to agree with this, and called the law unjust
 unka kahana tha, "sabhi logon kii zindagi ek samaan hoti he

 languron ke liye jab pedo se fal todakar khaane kii baat ho, to ve phir idhar-udhar matargashti karne main apana samay nahin ganvaate balki us samay unka puraa dhyaan apana pet bharne par hota he
 This habit of langurs has led to the discovery of a new type of orange in South Africa
 dakshin africa kisaan elvin vaan der marve ne bataaya ki kai saal pehle mazdooron ne dekha ki ek ped par lage santaron ko langur jald hi chat kar gaye
 At that time there were oranges on other trees too, but the langurs first swooped on the oranges of that particular tree
 agle saal bhi thik aisa hi hua
 It has become a puzzle for farmers and farm laborers why langurs are the first to make their food to the oranges of a particular tree
 is par ek majdoor ne is rahasy ko aakhirkaar sulajhaa liya
 It turned out that the oranges of the tree on which the Langur army falls, in fact, the oranges of that tree are ripened three to four weeks before the oranges on the other trees
 marve ne bataaya ki baad main pareekshan main pataa chalaa ki languron kii pasand ke ped par lage santare khaane main mithe hote hai or ye teji se pakate hai
 This farmer later made more trees from that tree with a pen
 dakshin africa kii sritas grour association ke pramukh justin chadwick ne kaha ki visheshgy prayogshaalaon main lagaataar santare kii aisi kism viksit karne main lage hai, jo khaane main mithi or teji se pakane vaali ho

 pesh hai unase hui baatcheet ke ansh:sanskrit aaj khatm hoti hui si kyon najar aa rahi he?sanskrit bhashaa khatm hone ke peeche sabase badi vajah he vijan
 People did not give the vision to Sanskrit readers properly
 hamaari sabase badi kami ye he ki ham logon ko jod nahin paa rahe or wo jud nahin paa rahe hai
 The second reason is that Sanskrit never became a means of livelihood
 pehle log sanskrit padhakar shashan-prashasan me oonche padon par hote the
 With time, this has stopped happening
 sarkaar se sanskrit ko lekar aapaki kya apeksha he ?prashasan ne bhi sanskrit bhashaa kii upeksha kii he
 As the English language was promoted at all levels, Sanskrit could also be given
 suna he centre sarkaar sanskrit ko skulon main anivaary kar rahi he?aisa hona sambhav nahin he
 Sanskrit language can be kept as subject but the central government cannot make it mandatory
 isaki vajah yah bhi he ki sanskrit se kisi party kaa vot bank nahin badhata he
 Sanskrit has done the most harm by minority attitude, because the government feels that one class will benefit from the work done in this field of language, the other class will get angry
 hamen is manovriti se upar uthne kii jarurat he
 What are the special books for Sanskrit readers today? There are good resources for Sanskrit learners today
 is bhashaa main lagaataar kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 There are many novels and meanwhile many stories have also been written
 agar aap sanskrit main ruchi rakhte hai to bhagavatagita, abhigyaan shakuntalam, meghdoot padhein
 Why is Sanskrit limited to religion today? The reason behind Sanskrit being limited to religion is the reason of Sanskrit teachers
 unhone logon ke saamne use dharm maatr se jodakar rakhaa he
 Today people are not interested in Sanskrit but choose Sanskrit names in the naming of their children
 iske peeche vajah kya he?log hamase bhi poochhate hai ki hamaare bachche kaa naam bataa dijie
 This is because Sanskrit is in the blood of the people
 log usase aaj bhi jude rahanaa chaahate hai kyonki ve maanate hai ki ye hamaara sanskaar he
 How can people be connected with Sanskrit language today? People need to show the right vision
 jo sanskrit padhaate he unhen apni jimmedaari ko gambhirtha se adaa karnaa hoga
 You have been honored with such great respect, what would you like to say? This honor is like someone who has gone on a journey to Vaishno Devi and asks some food and water to a tired person in the middle of the road
 asal main sammaan miltaa he to acha lagata he

 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan bluetooth se iviem main chhedchhad kii shikaayat ko chunaav ayog ne khaarij kar diya
 During the voting this morning, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia had complained of tampering of evms at three polling stations in Porbandar
 ayog ne kaha ki shikayatakarta ke mobile phone main bluetooth on karne ke baad jis upkaran kaa pataa laga, vah koi electronic voting mashin (iviem) nahin thi balki ek matdaan agent kaa mobile phone tha
 Earlier, as polling continued in 89 seats of the first phase of Gujarat assembly elections, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia had complained to evms of possible polling at three polling stations in a Muslim-dominated area of porbandar
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki kuch electronic voting mashine (iviem) bluetooth ke jariye bahari upkarnon se judi pai gai hai
 Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Bibi Swain told reporters in the evening that according to the report received after the investigation conducted by him, when Bluetooth was being turned on in the complainant's mobile phone, another as 'ECO 105' Equipment was available
 swine ne kaha ki ashanka hui ki ‘isio 105’ matdaan centre main lagiiviemhai, jisase bluetooth takanic ke jariye sambhavit chhedchhad kaa dar paidaa hua
 He said that the collector and supervisor were sent to the polling stations from which the complaint came and the complainant was also called
 swine ne kaha ki sthaneey media ke saamne jaanch karai gai or jila nirvachan adhikari (diio) kii ore se saunpi gai report main kaha gaya he ki ek matdaan agent ke paas intex company kaa ek mobile phone tha jis par ‘isio 105’ model number ke taur par ankit tha
 He said that a polling agent named Manoj Singarkhiya was carrying a mobile phone
 vah shikayatakarta ke phone ke kareeb khadaa tha
 The complainant may have thought that 'EC' in the ECO means Election Commission
 isse pehle modhwadiya ne kaha tha ki hamane paaya ki muslim bahul ilaake memnawada ke teen matdaan kendron main electronic voting mashine bluetooth ke jariye bahari upkarnon se judi hui hai
 Whenever a mobile phone's Bluetooth is turned on, a device called 'ECO 105' appears
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki iskaa saaf matlab he ki bluetooth ke jariye upkaran kaa istemaal kar electronic voting mashiinon se chhedchhad kii ja sakati he
 The Congress leader said that the chips installed in evms are programmable through Bluetooth and it creates the possibility of tampering
 voting pranali bahari upkarnon se aise judaav se mukt honi chahie
 However, the BJP said that the complaint made by Modhwadia shows that the opposition Congress is looking for an excuse as it knows that it is going to face a tough defeat in the elections
 bhaajapa pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha ki congress ke sadsy kah rahe hai ki iviem main gadabadi he
 The Election Commission should respond to this, but we can say that before the results are out, the Congress is busy looking for excuses, because it has seen its defeat in the elections
 ve iviem ke peeche chhipane kii koshish kar rahe hai

 The GIC ground of Rae Bareli has been witness to large election rallies, but on April 21, the Congress domination was shown for the first time
 congress kii purv rashtriya adhyakshasonia gandhike sansadeey kshetra raibareli bhagava binar or poster se pata tha lekin jiisi maidan par yojit bhartiya janata party kii "parivartan sankalp raily'' ke mukhya manch ke binar se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa chitra nadaarad tha
 The family of Dinesh Pratap Singh (whose house in Rae Bareli, whose house is called Panchwati), once said to be very close to Sonia Gandhi, had to hold the lotus with his hands, this was the reason for the BJP rally in the Congress stronghold
 raily main bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath samet bhaajapa sarkaar ke kai mantri maujuud the
 Before the rally, Amit Shah inducted several Congress leaders in the Legislative Council including Congress leader Dinesh Pratap Singh, his brother Zilla Panchayat President Awadhesh Singh into the BJP
 haalanki sadsyta jane ke dar se dinesh ke chote bhai or raibareli ke harchandpur vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak rakesh singh ne bhaajapa kii sadsyta nahin lee
 Later, Amit Shah started a rally against the Gandhi family in Rae Bareli
 apane aadhe ghante ke sambodhan main amit shah ne kai baar panchvati parivaar ke sadasyon kaa zikr karke yah sanket diya ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main raibareli main dinesh pratap singh kii badi bhoomika hogi
 a big leader of the saffron party is strongly advocating for making Dinesh Pratap Singh a candidate against Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ne sonia gandhi ke khilaaf supreme court ke vakil ajay agarwal ko maidan main utaara tha
 Sonia Gandhi got five and a half lakh votes in the election, while Ajay was reduced to just two and a half lakh votes
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main raibareli loksabhaa seat main aane vaali paanch vidhansabha siton main congress keval raibareli sadar or harchandpur hi jeet saki thi
 The BJP is keen to contest the next Lok Sabha elections very strongly against Sonia Gandhi
 isiilie bhaajapa congress ke sthaneey netaaon ko todakar raiberli main sonia gandhi ko kamjor karnaa chaahati he
 When the BJP joined hands, Dinesh Pratap Singh fiercely washed away his 15-year relationship with the Congress at the Shirpavarthan Sankalp rally
 congress sarkaar ke dauraan hue raibareli ke vikaas ko nishane par lete hue dinesh pratap singh bole, "fursatganj main rashtriya udaan academy kii sthapana hui lekin pichley 30 varshon main raibareli kaa ek bhi yuva yahaan se payalat nahin ban sakaa
 However, Sonia Gandhi herself has taken the front to break the siege of the BJP
 bhaajapa kii raily se teen din pehle 18 april ko sonia gandhi dedh varsh baad apane sansadeey kshetra raibeli pahunchin or 70 karod ru
 Launched plans for more than
 vidhaan parishad sadsy dinesh pratap singh ke congress chhodie ke baad sonia gandhi ne congress ke yuva vidhaan parishad sadsy dinesh singh or raibareli sadar se yuva vidhayak aditi singh ko aage kiya he
 Sonia Gandhi sowed the seeds of new equations by reaching "neelam Mansion", the newly constructed residence of Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA Manoj Pandey from Unchahar, opposite the city PAC in Rae Bareli
 sapa main haashie par chal rahe manoj pandeya haalanki sonia ke apane awaas par aane ko mahaj ek shishtachar bataate hai lekin is mulaakaat main aane vaale dinon kii ek badi rajnatik uthaa-patake ke beej chhipe hue hai
 However, the strategy of feeding the lotus by freeing Rae Bareli's earth from clawing will be determined by how the saffron party is able to cut the emotional bond between the Rae Bareli and Gandhi family? *** ek australian vigyaani ne duniyabar main mashhoor oxford english dictionari (oxford English Dictionary) kii aisi galati pakadi he, jo pichley 99 saal main kisi kii nazar main nahin ai thi, or is vajah se oxford english dictionari ko sifan (siphon) kii paribhaasha badalani padi he
 
 
 According to researchers, the Oxford Dictionary of English has been misinformed for nearly a century that air pressure works, not gravity, behind a siphon
 
 
 varsh 2010 main queensland uniwarsity of technology (queensland University of Technology) ke dow stephen hughes (dr Stephen Hughes) ne is galati ko pakadaa
 
 
 Dr
 Stephen Hughes then conducted an experiment in a Hypobaric Chamber to investigate the boundaries of the siphon and barometer, in which the effects of high altitude can be produced
 
 
 is chambar ke bheetar dedh meter kii oonchai par ek sifan taiyaar kiya gaya, or jab dabaav ko 40,000 foot kii oonchai ke baraabar kiya gaya, sifan ke sheersh par ek fawwara ban gaya, parantu pani kaa pravaah lagbhag samaan bana rahaa
 
 
 According to the researchers, taking the elevation to 41,000 feet, the fountain split into two streams of water, but when it was brought back to 40,000 feet, it went back as if nothing had happened
 
 
 mount everest (mount Everest) se bhi 10,000 foot zyaada oonchai vaale 40,000 foot par hawa kaa dabaav samudratal par maujuud dabaav kii tulana main lagbhag 18 pratishat rah jaataa he
 
 
 For use, two buckets were attached to each other through a tube, in which one was placed higher than the other
 
 
 iske baad ek pool pump ke jariye pani ko nichali baaltee se oonchai par rakhi baaltee main bheja gaya
 
 
 According to Dr
 Stephen Hughes, "the fact that the water level in the higher and lower buckets remained constant indicates that air pressure is not pushing the water into the siphon
 
 
 " According to Dr
 Stephen Hughes, the Oxford English Dictionary has corrected it when they catch a mistake, and has removed the mention of air pressure, but the new definition is still not entirely clear

 anirbaan kii bombai rence, bombai girls or maais in main nowell ko padhane ke baad anirbaan kii lekhnee kii kabaliyat ko log jaan gaye hai
 Anirban has the bizarre art of capturing and surprising readers
 bollywood filmon kii tarah anirbaan kii kahaniyon main bhi achaanak twist aa jaataa he
 Nowell's main character, Dr
 nil dev roy america chhodkar dilli ke aspataal adelfia hospital and research centre ko jwine karte hai
 Neil is an idealistic young surgeon who has set some principles to live life
 in aadarshon se nil kabhi bhi peeche nahin hatataa he
 Living among the ideals, Neil has to face many difficulties in the hospital
 paristhatiyon kaa saamana karte hue nil aspataal athurity, rajanetaaon, doctoron ke khilaaf sach kii ladaai ladata he
 Neil is shown fighting in favor of Mithali after a girl named Mithali Datto was not paid her fees in a case of brain dead in the hospital
 is marij ko aspataal main fees na die jane par marij ko maarane kii bhi koshish kii jaati he
 Neel follows his father's ideals, temperament and determination in surgery as well as personal life
 jindagi or aspataal main jab paristhitiyaan bigadane lagati hai to nil iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he
 Nowell loses his speed in explaining things related to anesthesia, surgery and medical
 baharhaal, nowell kii dilachasp kahani aam jindagi ke sach samete hue he
 Novell's reading is also interesting because this story tells how a doctor has to take difficult decisions at times, risking his life
 kitaab ke aakhir main kahani pathak ko achche-bure or sahi-galat ke bich jeetne ke ehsaas or vivek ke saath chhod jaaegi

 adwani ne kaha ki congress ko mumbai visphot kii ghatana ke liye ‘bali kaa bakra’ khojane kii koshish nahin kerani chahie
 Advani, in a commentary written on his blog, told the Center that he should make a 'fundamental' change in his policy regarding the warning of terrorism and if this is not done, such incidents will continue to happen in future
 unhone maharashtra kaa grih mantralay kaa prabhaar rakanpa kii ore se sanbhale jane ko lekar chavaan ke bayaan kaa ullekh karte hue kaha, ‘‘congress party ko haal main mumbai main hue bam visphot ke liye bali kaa bakra nahin khojane diya janaa chahie
 The common man must have been surprised to read that the Chief Minister of Maharashtra is blaming the NCP for the blasts as it was held by the Home Ministry in the state
 ’’adwani ne kaha ki kendriya grih mantri pi chidambaram ne yah kahkar swayan maharashtra ke grahamantri aaraar patil ko is aarope se doshamukt qaraar diya he ki visphot ke maamle main koi guptchar chook nahin hui thi, jiskaa matlab he ki sthaneey police kii koi galati nahin thi
 Demanding changes in the government's policy on combating terrorism, he said, "as far as the killing of people in Mumbai is concerned, you can hold the Chief Minister or Home Minister responsible for the state, but also New Delhi
 Is equally responsible
 ’’adwani ne kaha, ‘‘pradhanmantri or congress adhyaksh ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki jab tak aatankwaad ke mukaable ke liye bharat sarkaar kii niti main moulik parivartan nahin hota aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahengi
 Chavan had said in a controversial statement that it was a mistake for the Congress to agree to give the charge of important home ministry to NCP
 unke is bayaan par congress ke sahyogi rakanpa ne tikhi pratikriya kii thi
 Chavan had said in his statement, "I believed it was a mistake
" hamen us par punarvichaar karnaa chahie tha
 i do not know of any coalition government in which the Chief Minister does not have charge of important ministries like Home, Finance and Planning
 ’’ Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui has created a distinct identity in the film industry
 acting ke prati unke dedication kaa hi nateeja he ki aaj ve industry ke bade star ke taur par jane jate hai or unki tagdi fain folowing he
 Nawaz was in New York for the last few days shooting his upcoming film No Land Man
 isi dauraan unhen apni bahan ke nidhan kii dukhad khabar ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Despite this, Nawaz kept this thing hidden from the cast and crew and completed the shooting
 aisa khud film ke nirdeshak mustafa sarwar faruki ne puri jaankaree soshal media par share kii he
 The director shared a black and white photo of Nawaz on Instagram and said - Life is an artist in itself
 no land main main ek seen kii rirhasal ke dauraananavazuddinthoda imotional ho gaye the magar kyonki ve kaaphi profeshnal hai isliye unhone turant hi khud ko sambhaal liya
 But i later found out the reason for their emotional
 darasal film main ek seen rahata he jisamen navaj ko apni reel bahan sima se phone par baat kerani rahati he
 View this post on instagramlife of an artist! While rehearsing a scene from No Land's Man, @nawazuddin
 _siddiqui became slightly emotional but, since he is extremely professional, Nawaz quickly regained his composure
 Later on i came to know the reason
 The scene i mentioned was between him and his sister whose reel name was Saima
 He asked me if i knew his sister's name is Saima too
 i answered negative as my script was written five years ago and i had no idea about his sister
 He then told me his sister Saima has been suffering from cancer for eight years and he has been trying everything he could to help her in this battle
 So whenever he had scenes with Saima, he was feeling extremely emotional
 i did not know how to respond to this strange connection
 i forgot this quickly as i had other things to deal with
 Two days ago, while we were shooting a scene, he received a call
 We had no idea what was going on
 He completed the scene brilliantly
 After we packed up, i came to know he lost his sister while we were shooting that scene
 i have recently developed some idea about this man's attachment to his family
 As someone who is strongly connected to the family, i could completely understand how he was feeling
 i did not know how to deal with this situation
 But he knew
 While coordinating everything back home, he continued his shoot and made sure our New York shoot is completed
 He will fly home today
 Maybe he will be standing silently in front of her grave
 Maybe they will speak thousand words in silence
 Maybe fiction and reality will merge into each other

 i answer no, because i have no idea
 iske baad ve mujhe bataate hai ki unki bahan pichley 8 saalon se cancer se peedit hai or ve unhen bachaane kaa puraa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Whenever he films this scene of the film in which he has to talk to his sister on the telephone, he remembers his real sister and becomes emotional
 aage faruki kehete hai ki- do din pehle jab ham ek seen kii shooting kar rahe the, navaj ko ek kol ai
 We had no idea what the matter was
 unhone wo seen acchhee tarah se shoot kiya
 After the packup, i came to know that Nawaz's sister has passed away
 nirdeshak ke is post par log actor kii prashansa kar rahe hai saath hi unke bahan kii aatma kii shanti ke liye dua bhi kar rahe hai
 Let us know that despite knowing this sad news, Nawaz completed the shooting without disturbing anyone and ensured that the shooting of the New York schedule of the film was over or not
 iske baad ve ghar ke liye ravaanaa hue

 a good news is coming from Pakistan for former Navy Kulbhushan Jadhav who is jailed in Pakistan
 ek report ke anusaarakulbhushan jadhav ko apil kaa haq dene ke liye pakistan apane kanoon main badlaav karne kii soch rahaa he
 Explain that the international court had said during the hearing that Kulbhushan Jadhav should be given the right to appeal like a common citizen
 khaas baat yah he ki kuch din pehle hiantararashtriya nyaayalay (isije) ke adhyaksh nyaayadhish abdulkavi yusuf (abdulqawi Yusuf) ne yahaan sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko bataaya tha ki bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav (kulbhushan Jadhav) ke maamle main pakistan ne vienna sandhi ke tahat apane dayitvon kaa ulanghan kiya
 Presenting the International Court of Justice's report to the General Assembly, Yusuf said in his July 17 ruling that the United Nations' major judicial body "found that Pakistan had violated its obligations under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention" and Appropriate measures were yet to be taken in this matter
 '' bharat ke liye ek badi jeet ke rup main isije ne faisla sunaaya tha ki pakistan ko jadhav ko di gai maut kii sajaa kii samiksha kerani chahie, jo bhartiya nausena ke ek sevanivrutt adhikari the or jinhen pakistani sainya adaalat ne ‘‘jasusi or aatankwaad'' ke aaropon main maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 India argued that its citizens were not given access to the embassy, a violation of the 1963 Vienna Treaty
 yusuf kii aguwai vaali peeth ne ‘‘kulbhushan sudhir jadhav kii sajaa kii prabhavi samiksha or punarvichaar kaa aadesh diya tha
 While presenting his report to the General Assembly, Yusuf elaborated on several aspects of the court's decision in the Jadhav case
 kuch samay pehle hi pakistan kii jail main band nausena ke purv kulbhushan jadhav ko doosraa consular acces dene se manaa kar diya
 Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Dr
 mohammad faisal ne kaha tha ki kulbhushan jadhav (kulbhushan Jadhav) ko doosraa consular acces nahin milegaa
 'let me tell you, the recent Pakistani army claimed that the Indian High Commission officials were allowed to meet Kulbhushan Jadhav only after India agreed to five conditions
 bhartiya nausena ke sevanivrutt adhikari jadhav (49) ko pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne ‘jasusi or aatankwaad' ke aarope main april 2017 main maut kii sazaa sunai thi
 After this, India moved the International Court of Justice
 kulbhushan jadhav maamle main guuruuvaar ko international court apana faisla sunayega
 The eyes of the entire country will be set on this
 international court kaa yah faisla bharat ke apil karne ke 10 din baad hi aayega
 Before the verdict comes, statements of many celebrities have also started coming
 abhi tak kisne kya kaha?varisht vakil ujjwal nikam ne kaha ki international court apana faisla sunayega, court is baat par faisla karegaa ki pakistan ne vienna sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he yaa nahin
 Nikam said that India firmly put forward its stand, but Pakistan is only lobbying on Kulbhushan Jadhav's statement
 jadhav maamle main harish salve ne rakhaa bharat kaa paksh, yahaan padhein puri sunwyeesomvaar ko harish salve ne kii thi aguwaisomvaar ko hui sunwaayee main bharat ke varisht vakil harish salve ne bharat kii ore se pairvi kii
 India said in the hearing in the court that hearing the matter within seven days of India's appeal, it shows how severely the International Court is taking it
 salve ne kaha ki pakistan ne kulbhushan jadhav ko koi madad nahin kii, main bharat kii ore se yah bataanaa chahta hum ki bharat ke 125 karod log kulbhushan jadhav kii vaapasi kii raah dekh rahe hai

 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan took oath as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan on Saturday
 shapath lene se ek din pehle unhone pakistani sansad ke nichle sadan main bahumat sabit kiya
 During this, he addressed the people of Pakistan and said that the robbers of the country will not be spared in our government
 is dauraan wo behad akramak najar aae
 In his first address as Prime Minister, he said, 'I promise my country today that we will bring the changes for which this country has been trying for a long time
 hamen is desh main sakht javabdehi kaayam kerani he
 i promise that i will take action against those who looted Pakistan
 jis kaale dhan ko safed kiya gaya, main use waapas laaungaa
 The money that should have been spent on education, health and water went into the pockets of the people
 'bhaashan kaa isliye ho rahaa virojhunke is bhaashan main ek pradhanmantri nahin balki ek virdohi kheme ke netaa ke taur par najar aae
 From this speech, Pakistan hoped that he would talk about the country, but in most parts of his speech, there was a sneering and attacking attitude on the opposition
 ummiido ke vipareet unke sambodhan main unki paaramparik faiyrabrands style najar ai
 In which he targeted the entire time opposition, ridiculing political opponents
 pakistan kii janata ko unase santulit bhaashan kii ummid thi, jisamen sarkaar ko ek behatar disha dene ke liye samavesh, sulah or raajnneetik virodhiyon ke prati khulepan par baat honi chahie thi
 But he challenged his political opponents with bitterness
 vipakshi netaaon ko dakait kah daladrasal, shahabaaz ne chetaya ki yadi sarkaar ne chunaavon main dhokhadhadi kii jaanch nahin kii to vah pradarshan shuru karenge
 At this, Imran challenged Shahbaz to sit in d-chowk for a month
 imran ne kaha, 'mujhe koi blackmel karne kii koshish nahin kare
 'pashtun, who founded PTI in 1996, said that he has reached this point after 22 years of struggle
 bhrashtachar ke maamle main doshi qaraar die gaye navaj sharif kii taraf paroksh ishaara karte hue imran ne kaha ki vah kisi 'dakait' ke prati koi narmi nahin baratenge
 Khan's speech was followed by a sort of fury in political and public circles
 kai logon ne kaha ki khan ko shant or gambhir hokar bhaashan dena chahie tha, nae pradhanmantri se is tarah ke bhaashan kii ummid nahin hoti
 Kanwar Dilshad, former Election Commission secretary of Khushpakistan, is not a political analyst, spoke to the Express Tribune regarding PM Imran Khan's speech
 unhone kaha, 'unhen apane tareeke sudhaarney kii jarurat he, jitna jald karenge utana behatar hoga
 He said that Khan needs to adjust to the new political realities as he is at the top and has to sit on the chair that runs the country in the National Assembly
 dilashaad ne kaha ki ek chune hue pradhanmantri ko vipaksh ke netaa kii tarah vyavhaar nahin karnaa chahie
 They will have to face criticism and they will have to play the role of a person to eliminate mutual differences and tension
 dilashaad ke mutabik pakistan ke sansad main bahumat pareekshan ke dauraan vipaksh ke ravaiye se pareshaan hokar unhone apana aapa kho diya
 "perhaps it is not seen from Imran that ppp's announcement to abstain from voting in Friday's election was clearly in his favor," he said
 darasal, wo ummid kar rahe the ki bahumat pareekshan ke baad vipaksh kii pratikriya aupchaarik hogi
 But the leaders of the opposition expressed anger after the vote in the house and also protested
 aisa prathit hota he ki is apratyaashit pratikriya ke baad nav nirvaachit pradhanmantri ne apana gussa kho diya or wo aakraamak ho gaye
 But they need to learn to be calm
 'imran ne kaha, 'main kisi taanashaah ke kandhon par chadhakar nahin aayaa; main 22 saalon ke sangharsh ke baad is mukaam par pahunchaa hum
 Only one leader fought more than me and he was my hero (the founder of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali) Jinnah
 'party ke log bhi bhaashan kii style se naakhushyaha tak ki bahumat pareekshan ke baad khud pitiai ke netaaon ne mana ki sadan main unke netaa yani imran khan kaa ravaiya anuchit tha
 At the same time, some leaders of Khan's party also supported him
 naam jaahir na karne kii shart par pitiai ke ek netaa kaha ki imran khan ne apane bhaashan ko bahut had tak santulit dikhaanaa chaha
 At the same time, Imran tried to show something different from his speech given after the victory of the party
 iske liye unhone khaas taur par taiyaari kii thi
 He said, 'but things have not gone as they thought
 vipaksh dwaara sadan main hangaamaa khadaa karne ke baad wo apane raste se utar gaye
 i hope they will be able to handle it further
 'piemail-en ke varisht netaa rana sanaulla ne khan ke bhaashan par patalwaar karte hue kaha, 'aap desh kepradhanmantrihain
 You should do your level work keeping in mind the dignity of that post
 aapako vyavhaar karnaa siikhnaa hoga
 'he said tightly,' Imran Khan will be able to remain in power for a short time only
 lekin jab tak aap vahaan ho, aapakon dusron kaa sammaan karnaa siikhnaa hoga
 ' sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavat' ke johar seen ko lekar film industry do khemon main bant gaya he
 In fact, recently, Swara Bhaskar wrote an open letter to Bhansali, accusing women of presenting women as objects through the film
 unhone kaha tha, mahilaayein sirf vajaina nahin hai
 For the past few days, Bollywood celebs have been reacting to this
 swara bhi twitor pratikriyaaon kaa jawaab to de hi rahi hai sawaal bhi puch rahi hai
 But in an interview, she refrained from repeatedly naming the word, which she is debating on Feminism by writing on Twitter
 sammanjanak tareeke se rakhi batspotboy se kii ek report ke mutabiq swara ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki sabko apni pratikriya dene kaa haq he
 i put my point in a very respectful manner
 mere man main koi buree manshaa nahin thi
 The questions i asked were very legitimate
 agar log mujhase sahamat nahin hai to wo bhi thik he
 It is a democracy right now
 suchithra ne swara ko gheraa to mila jawaab- 'phani, sirf vajaina yaad rahaa'shabd ko dohraane par jhijak padin swarajab swara se poocha gaya, aapako laga tha ki is par itnaa bavaal hoga to unhone kaha ki mujhe is baat kaa bilkul bhi andaja nahin tha
 i did not know that people who are not connected to films will also give their opinion and express their displeasure on me
 jab unase open letters main prayog kii gai bhashaa or shabd par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone jawaab diya, mujhe nahin pataa tha ki jo shabd maine letters main likhaa, wo angreji main 'V' se or hindi main 'ya' se shuru hota he
 So many people will feel bad about that
 open letters main bold shabdon kaa prayog karne vaali swara ko event main unheen shabdon ko bolne main kaaphi jhijak mahasoos hui
 He even went on to say, 'I cannot name that word here because many family channels are also present in the event here
 ''khokhale feminism' par nirdeshak ne bastar jane kii salaah di, swara ne jataai hairanipadmavati ke saath hum hameshaswara ne safai dene ke lahaze main kaha, shuru se sanjay sar kaa saport kiya he
 i have made consistent statements against the Karni Sena
 maine padmavati ke haq par hameshaa baat kii
 But once the film is done, it arrives on the public platform
 phir jab padmavat ne itani badi baaten samaaj ke saamne rakhin hai to mujhe laga meri baaten bhi desh ke saamne aani chahie
 i was not given money to speak
 Some one asked Neswara whether what he said was paid
 Angry Swara said, 'you guys never gave me money
 agali baar media bhi mujhase sawaal puche to acha hoga aap pehle paise den
 'swara has questioned those who are calling it a publicity stunt
 unhone kaha ki ek ladki jo kalakaar he jab bhi sawaal uthaati he to use yahi kaha jaataa he
 That he has taken the money to tell the truth
 uskaa koi charitra nahin he
 He is jealous of someone's success
 maine jo bhi sawaal kiye wo jaij the
 i did not know that the people of India read so much
 ye jaanakar acha laga ki logon ne meri chitthee padhi or unka interest jaag gaya

 Congress has been embarrassed amid the electoral atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh
 nirvachan ayog ne kendriya kanoon mantrisalman khurshidki is ghoshnaa par ki yadi congress uttar pradesh main satta main ai, to alpsankhyakon ko sarkari naukariyon main 9 fisadi aarakshan diya jayega, unhen adarsh chunaav aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ke liye fatkaar lagaai
 In its fifteen-page order, the commission said that Salman Khurshid has violated the Model Election Code of Conduct by making a 'new' promise to provide 9 per cent reservation to minorities under the 27 per cent reservation prescribed for the Other Backward Classes
 ayog ne unki is daleel ko khaarij kar diya ki unhone kisi dharm, jati yaa panth kaa vot hasil karne ke makasad se aisi ghoshnaa nahin kii thi
 The Election Commission also rejected Khurshid's party's claim that he promised the people, not as a minister, but as a Congress leader
 ayog kii ore se jari aadesh main kaha gaya he, 'ayog salmaan khurshid ko doshi maanata he or apeksha karata he ki vah bhavishya main aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan jaisaa krity nahin doharaaenge
 It is worth mentioning that while addressing an election rally in Farrukhabad in favor of his wife Luis, Khurshid announced the reservation in order to campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 congress netaubhishek manu singhviayog ke samaksh upasthit hue the or unhone kaha tha ki khurshid kaa vaada sashart ghoshnaa thi or unhone kisi alpsankhyak samudaay kaa zikr nahin kiya tha
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also appeared before the commission in support of his complaint
