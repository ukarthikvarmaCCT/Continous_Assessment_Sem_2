 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ravivaar ko kaha ki unhen maovadiyon dwaara 29 agast ko luckhisarai main agava kiye gayi teen pulicekarmiyon ko reeha karne kii koi jaankaree nahin he
 Nitish told reporters here that i have no information about the release of the hostages (by the Maoists)
 maovadiyon kii taraf se daawa kiya gaya tha unhone bandhakon ko mukt kar diya he, jiske baad mukhyamantri kaa bayaan aayaa
 Significantly, the Maoists had earlier claimed to have murdered a sergeant, whose body was later found

 agar 78 over baaki ho or banane ke liye sirf 4 ran ho to aap us team kii jeet pakki samaj rahe honge
 However, in such a situation of a match in Pakistan, the team also had to face defeat
 vah bhi vivadaspad niyam mancading kii vajah se
 Let us tell you that a unique case of Pakistanmankading has come up
 isse ek baar phir mancading par bahes shuru kar di he
 Pakistan's domestic cricket qaid-e-azam was pitted against the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in a match in the tournament
 WAPDA ko aakhri din jeet ke liye 78 over main 4 ran banane the
 However after the three days were over, the match was tilted on both sides
 peshawar ko bhi jeet ke liye sirf ek wicket kii jarurat thi
 Whatever the decision was Team Wapda has more Senior Cricketers then Peshawar, it was their duty to ensure the Sportsmanship in the groundpic

 com / cwo9km4tyq — Ibrahim Badees (@ibrahimbadees) October 18, 2017 Mohammed Shaad was batting and supporting him on the non-striker end with Mohammad Irfan
 vaheembowlingka jimmaa taj ali ke haath main tha
 In this situation, Taj Ali proceeded to bowl and before bowling, saw that Mohammad Irfan has been out of the crease
 aise main unhone irfan ko mancading ke jariye out kar diya
 In such a situation, the umpire had no choice but to give out
 apanyar ne ek baar filding team se dobaaraa apane nirnay par vichaar karne ko bhi kaha
 However the WAPDA team did not change its decision
 is vajah se WAPDA ko peshawar ke haathon teen ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This is the rule of mancading
 According to ICC rules related to mancading, if the non-striker leaves his crease before throwing the ball, the bowler can try to run out without throwing the ball
 ranout safal hone par ballebaaj out mana jayega, lekin koi ball nahin count hogi
 The ball will be considered deadball if the runout is not successful

 Actually the middle class does not come with only jobs

 With this interim budget, the youth feel that Surat will change, as it is an election year

 Fourth demand - poor students get interest-free loans for higher education

 Maintain trust - mutual trust works to strengthen the relationship

 Live yourself free and give them genes of your choice too
 agar aap partner ko apane hisaab se baandhne kii koshish karenge to kuch samay main aapse kataraane lagegaa
 Avoid negative things - do not talk about your personal things in front of anyone nor make fun of your partner
 har samay apane partner ko jaj karnaa bhi chhod den
 By doing this, tension will remain between you all the time and gradually you can create hatred between you
 aapas kii baton milakar sulajhane kaa prayaas karen or kabhi bhi kisi tisare se salaah lene se bachein
 Work with restraint - there are battles and fights in every relationship

 Therefore whenever this happens, understand the depth of the matter and take a decision

 i have brought that part of his speech to writing which refers to today's controversy
 ye amit shah ke bayaan kaa hissaa he
 There are no sentences, but literally, Amit Shah says that Mamta Di started to save the accused of the bomb blast inside Bardhaman
 main aap logon ko kahana chahta hum ki jo 2 aktubar ko bam blast main jo vyakti maaraa gaya wo shakeel ahamed pehle bhi bam blast main fanse hue the
 Why did the Bengal police not catch him? jinke ghar ke andar ye bam blast hua wo nurul hasan choudhary koun the
 Mamata Di had given statements in protest against giving investigation to NIA
 kisko bachaana chaahatin he
 You cannot rule Bangladesh on the basis of Bangladeshi infiltrators, Mamata
 bangladeshi ghuspaithi, ghuspaithi hai aapako bangladesh kaa mukhyamantri nahin banaaya
 If you want to save Trinamool on the basis of infiltrators of Bangladesh, then i have no hesitation in saying that your countdown has started
 bardhaman ke andar ardex pakadaa jaataa he
 NIA is not allowed to work
 kitne saare tiemasi ke netaa is blast ke saath jude hue hai mitron
 And when the investigation of who gave the money to those who are behind Bardhaman started, then you will be surprised to hear that even after that the money of Saradha scam has been used behind this bomb blast
 or ye donon jaanch ek mode par jaakar club ho rahi hai
 The CBI is also investigating this case
 is bayaan ke anusaar amit shah ne do agenciyon kii jaanch ke aadhaar par ye aarope lagaae hai
 Now this question should have been asked by the government to the Trinamool Congress mps, but only two BJP mps have asked
 bihar ke gaya se saansad hari maanjhi or karnataka ke dharwar se saansad prahlada joshi
 In response to these questions, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh has given a written reply
 sawaal tha− sharada chit fund ghotaale kii jo jaanch hui he usamen kya sibiai ko kuch aisa mila he jisase ye lage ki iskaa paisa bangladesh main aatanki gatividhiyon ke liye diya gaya he
 Jitendra Singh- Investigations have not yet revealed any such transaction that Bangladesh money was sent to help terrorist operations
 jo baat sarkaar apni party ke saansad se kahati he kya wo baat wo party ke rashtriya adhyaksh se nahin kahati hogi
 That the investigation is going on and till now there is no evidence that Trinamool leaders have invested the money of Sharda Chit Fund in terrorist activities
 zaahir he trinmul congress kaaphi gusse main he, uske saansad vaise hi kabhi kaali chhatari to kabhi kaale rang kii shawl to kabhi laal diary lekar sansad aa jate hai
 By the way, the Trinamool Congress too must have made some allegations without investigation
 janata ke bich kuch bhi bol dijie
 Will get power, then there is no account of the spoken
 jisko satta nahin milegi wo you-turn pustika chhapavata phiregaa

 kya kahin kanoon main likhaa he ki jaanch puri hone se pehle aap aarope laga sakate hai, magar clin chit nahin de sakate hai
 Even if the investigation is complete, the investigation agency or court will give clean chit
 phir amit shah ko kya yah nahin bataanaa chahie ki unhen kisne bataaya ki paisa aatankwaadi kaarywahi main istemaal hua he
 Overall, the investigation into the scam in the chit-fund has already led to a scam in the clean chit

 Madrasas have been surveyed secretly for a year and nothing objectionable has been found
 bengal, bihar, upi or kerala ke madrase hi he jo regulated hai
 Are recognized
 bardhaman dhamaake main yah baat saamne ai thi ki bangladesh kaa ek vyakti vahaan madrasa chalaa rahaa tha or ladakiyon ko jihadi training de rahaa tha
 Sources in the intelligence agencies have told the Express reporter that nothing has been found so far
 lekin, 31 aktubar ko india today kii ek report he jisamen kaha gaya he ki rashtriya jaanch angency enie ko bangladesh seemaa se lage avaidh madrason main 58 aatanki madul mili hai
 Based on the intelligence agencies report, in 2011, Bengal BJP President Rahul Sinha had said that anti-india activities are going on in most of the Madrasas along the border
 12 june 2011 ke hindu akhbaar main yah khabar chhapi he
 The BJP had then opposed Mamata Banerjee's decision to recognize 10,000 madrasas in Bengal, saying that Mamata Banerjee was playing with national unity
 mamata ne kaha tha ki sirf manyata di gai he koi aarthik madad nahin

 (aadesh dube itmi ke chaatr hai or india today main prashikshu hai)*** a case of attempted rape and ruthless killing has come up in Greater Noida, UP
 jahaan ek 13 varshiya ladke ne ek dhai saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath balaatkaar karne kii koshish kii or jab wo apane makasad main kaamyaab nahin hua to usne bacchee kaa galaa dabaakar use maar daalaa
 The case is related to Bisarkh police station area of noida
 police ne naaballig aaropee ko hiraasat main liya he
 Actually, in the footage of a CCTV camera installed there, the accused boy was seen carrying a two and a half year old innocent girl with him
 usee ke aadhaar par police ne jaanch ke baad use hiraasat main liya tha
 This incident of murder took place three days ago
 jab dhai saal kii maasoom bacchee kigala dabaakar hatyakar di gai thi
 When the police caught the accused boy, he told that he did not do anything wrong with the girl
 sirf munh pakadaa tha
 Throat was caught jab vah chillane lagi to wo vahaan se bhaag gaya tha
 What happened there after that
 use nahin pataa hai
 Currently, on the basis of CCTV footage, the police have sent the accused boy to a child improvement home
 sthaneey police adhikari kii maane to teen din purv dhai saal kii bacchee kii galaa dabaakar hatya kii gai thi
 Police received CCTV footage during the investigation
 jisamen aaropee ladkaa bacchee ko saath le jate hue dekha gaya
 The accused told the police during questioning that he had a thought while watching a film
 jiske anusaar vah bacchee ke saath kuch aniatik karnaa chahta tha lekin vah chillane lagi
 During the investigation, police came to know that the 13-year-old accused boy used to watch porn videos
 jisaki vajah se vah sex edict ban gaya tha
 On the other hand, the girl's family alleges that the police is rescuing another accused in this case, because two people are seen carrying the girl in CCTV
 asaram jail main jhalla rahaa he or uske indore ashram main ek khaas taiyaari chal rahi he
 His servants are gathered in a room with a long list of phone numbers and calling everyone and calling for a rally to be held in the city

 He expects 5000 people to gather in the rally
 haalanki raily ke liye police se ijaajat nahin lee gai he
 The special thing is that leaflets have been printed against the 16-year-old victim for this rally
 maamla adaalat main vichaaradhin he, par asaram samarthakon ne tippaniyan karne main koi kor-kasar nahin chodi he
 Asaram's servants are distributing these leaflets door-to-door and asking for support
 aapako bataate hai ki kya likhaa he is parche main
 It is written in the heading, 'what is truth' and these points are written next to it
 1
 The allegations are of sexual exploitation of the girl, but the rumor of rape is being spread
 medical report bhi aisa kahati he
 The Jodhpur Police has also admitted that Delhi Police wrongly registered the case
 2
 Why did the girl's family arrive five days after the incident to file a case? (asaram's supporters, while publishing this fact on the leaflet, may have forgotten that the court has given the women exemption in the current environment that they can come forward to report such incidents at any time
 )ashram main ashleel racket chalaata tha asaram, CD se hoga bhandaphod3
 The girl is from Shahjahanpur, then why did she file a case in Delhi itself? (while the truth is that after the Delhi gang rape case, any victim can complain to the nearby police station
 maamle ko sambandhit police stesan main transfar kar diya jayega
 ) 4
 ghatnasthal bataai ja rahi jagah se kutiyaa kaa get 50-60 feet dur he
 If even a 6-year-old girl shouts within, then her voice will reach 500 feet
 ladki ne exiaar main likhvaya he ki ghatana ke dauraan vah chillaati rahi
 Then why did his parents not hear his voice? 5
 ladki ne daawa kiya he ki baapu ne uskaa munh dhanka or uske puure sharir par dedh ghante tak haath phiraate rahe
 How can these two things be done together? uske chehre par bal prayog kiye jane kaa koi saboot nahin he

 No firm that claims the name of Makhnachor Kanhaiya, created in the Indian public, as its brand name and sells dairy products of privilege
 dilli ucch nyaayalay ne apane ek aadesh main kaha ki doodh or anya deyari utpaadon ke brands naam ke liye koi bhi company bhagwaan krishna ke naam ke upyog par apane vishesh adhikaar kaa daawa nahin kar sakati
 a bench of Justices Pradeep Nandrajog and Sunil Gaur passed the order dismissing the appeal of dairy company Bhole Baba Milk Food Industries Limited
 isse pehle ek nyaayadhish kii peeth ne company ke deyari utpaadon ke liye krishna shabd par vishisht adhikaar ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya tha jiske khilaaf company ne ukt apil kii thi
 Peetha said, everyone knows that Lord Krishna was known for his love of milk and butter in his childhood and hence Lord Krishna is deeply associated with milk and butter and with this the specific claim of adding the name Krishna with his dairy products is definitely It becomes weak
 isse pehle ekal nyaayadhish kii peeth ne shahar kii parul food spacialities ko apane dugdh utpaadon se krishna naam jodne se rokane se judi yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The bench had said that many dairy companies have named their products after Krishna and said that the company's claim on the term is not justified
 apane oonche bikri aankade kaa hawala dete hue bhole baba milk food industries limited ne kaha tha ki uske dugdh utpaadon ke sabandh main krishna shabd ne ek alag pahchaan bana lee he isliye uskaa is shabd par vishisht adhikaar he
 Parul Food Specialties, however, opposed it and said that Krishna is a common term and is also associated with Lord Krishna, who has a deep connection with butter, milk and ghee, so no one can assert his monopoly over it

 # Aa Rahi Hoon! @iamsrk @ritesh_sid @rahuldholakia @faroutakhtara post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Dec 18, 2016 at 8:38pm PST It would be a coincidence that the people of Sitamarhi district, the birthplace of Sita, are happy despite the absence of PM Narendra Modi and the people of Naga Janakpur of Raja Janak are looking more and more sad and angry
 darasal jab se pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa janakapur jane kaa sambhavit kaarykram aayaa tha, bihar sarkaar puri mustedi se sitamarhi se bhitamore kii 30 kilometre lambii sadak ko chamakane main lag gai
 It is a national highway
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana hai kii is raste main jitne diavarzan the, un par pehali baar alkatraa laga or ab yah pakki sadak ban gai he or ab is par farrotedaar speed main aadhe ghante main nepal seemaa pahunche sakate he
 At the same time, the people of Nepal were also very happy at first, because the distance of 19 kilometers from Bhittamod border to Janakpur was completed in an hour and a half, there is work or work is done there, but due to the news of the arrival of Indian Prime Minister, those people It is feared that the work which was being done to fill the pits in the road with soil, may stop now
 nepal sarakar ke sadak vibhaag ke ek engeenior kaa ronaa tha kii is sadak nirmaan kaa theka jis bhartiya company ko diya gaya tha, vah kaam nahin kar rahi
 Whereas, the people of Nepal say that work could not be done due to demand of extortion
 janakapur ke logon ke mutabik, unhen kaaphi ummid thi ki pradhanmantri modi janaki mandir main darshan ke bahaane tarai kshetra ke logon kii samasya kaa nidaan kaa jarur kuch upaay lekar aaenge
 His expectations related to this visit of PM Modi can be gauged from the fact that those people believe that Modi does not listen to the problem, but his research team makes him aware of one thing in advance
 piem modi aate to usee bahaane madhesi netaa apni raajnneeti bhi chamakaate, kyonki pichley baar modi se kathmandu main mulaakaat ke baad vah kaaphi maayoos hue the, lekin ye mauka bhi unke haath se ab chalaa gaya
 The stars of Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Azam Khan are walking in the clouds these days
 bhoomafia ghoshit hone ke baad vah kareeb ek maheene se apane grih janapad rampur nahin aae hai
 Earlier, when he was an MLA and lived in Lucknow, he usually spent Saturdays and Sundays at his native Rampur
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii diggaj netaa jaya pradaa ko haraane vaale ajam khan par ab kisaanon kii jameen, nadiyon kii jameen par kabja karne kaa aarope he
 He has more than 26 lawsuits
 ab sawaal he ki kya ajam khan giraftaar ke dar se rampur nahin aa rahe hai?espi ajay paal sharma ne IANS se kaha ki espi netaa ajam par jo dharaaen hai, usamen giraftaar ho sakati he
 It is not that if he comes to Rampur, we will arrest him
 'jabase ajam khan par maamle darj hue hai tabase vah rampur main dikhaai nahin die'espi netaa akhilesh yadav ne kaha, 'espi saansad ajam khan rampur aane se koi parhez nahin kar rahe hai
 The bus parliament is running
 isi kaaran unki vyastata rahi he
 Even before when he was a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, every Saturday, Sunday he used to stay at Rampur
 yahaan unka paitruk nivas he
 He has not been here since the session has started
 baaki rahi baat mukademe kii to raajnneetik kaarnon se lagaae gaye hai
 They will get rid of it soon
 'unhone kaha, 'lagbhag 25 dinon se to sansad kaa satr hi chal rahaa he
 Apart from that, his wife is also not well and she is admitted
 lihaaja, unhen unki dekh-rekh bhi kerani pad rahi hai
 He will soon come to Rampur
 'jiladhikari anjaneya kumaar singh ne IANS ko bataaya, 'ajam khan hamaare saansad hai vah jan pratinidhi hai
 The administration has not imposed any restriction on their arrival
 lekin shapath lene ke baad vah sirf ek baar hi yahaan aae hai
 It can also be said that he has not appeared in Rampur ever since cases have been registered against him
 'congress alpsankhyak vibhaag ke pradesh upaadhyaksh faisal khan lala ne kaha, 'ajam khan par kisaanon kii jameen, nadiyon kii jameen kabja karne kaa aarope he
 He has more than 26 lawsuits
 vah bhoomafia bhi hai
 Azam has occupied the land of farmers together with CO Ali Hassan
 ajam khan ko pataa he ki vah rampur aaenge to vah giraftaar honge
 That is why they are not coming
 philhal vah ek maheene se rampur nahin aae hai
 One reason for not coming to Rampur is that they have done something wrong
 unamem kuch khont he
 BJP state spokesperson and in-charge of Rampur, Dr
 Chandramohan said, 'the government is taking strict steps against the land mafia
 kisi bhi keemat par unhen choda nahin jayega
 The truth of sp's MP is coming out
 isi kaaran vah munh chupa rahe hai
 Azam Khan has occupied the land of the poor, farmers and minorities
 aise main kis munh se rampur ke kisaanon kaa saamana karenge
 He said that the Yogi government has taken strict action against the land mafia
 isi kaaran atik ahamed jaise bhoomafia ko jail kii hawa khaani pad rahi he
 The government is not going to compromise law and order
 gauratlab he ki do darjan se bhi adhik maamalon main fanse samaajawaadee party (espi) ke varisht netaa or saansad ajam khan kii mushkilen kam hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 The police, under the leadership of the Superintendent of Police, raided Mohammad Ali Johar University and recovered nearly two thousand prized books and manuscripts stolen from the university's Mumtaz Central Library
 kuch antic furniture bhi baraamad hua he
 Recently, Sadar Maulana Mohabbay Ali Naimi and Mohammad Hussain Sabri of Tanjim awam-e-ahle Sunnah complained to the District Magistrate that there was a treasure trove of prized books in Madrasa Aaliya from where books have been stolen

 Crude oil prices are steadily increasing internationally
 iskaa asar desh main petrol-dijal kii keemten badhane ke taur par najar aa rahaa he
 1 in the prices of petrol and diesel within the last one month
 50 rupee se zyada kaa ijapha dekhne ko mila he
 There is little hope of relief from the government for the burden on the common man due to the price of crude oil
 'dekho, kya ho saktaa he'ek kaarykram main pahuncheoil ministardharmendra ne petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton se aam aadmi ko raahat dene ko lekar sirf itnaa hi kaha, 'dekhiye, kya ho saktaa he
 'in such a situation, speculations are being made that there is little hope of relief from the rising prices of petrol and diesel from the central government
 ye hai maujuuda keemtshuukravaar ko dilli main jahaan ek litre petrol 69
 At Rs 85, the diesel is also Rs 58
 31 rupee prati litre mil rahaa he
 Crude oil prices have reached above $ 60 a barrel
 iskaa sidhaa asar petrol-dijal kii keemton par pad rahaa he
 Because of which their prices are increasing day by day
 rajyon ke paale main ja sakati he gendpetrol-dijalki keemton main philhal sarkaar se raahat milane kii ummid kam hi he
 One reason for this is that recently the Central Government had reduced the excise duty on petrol and diesel
 aise main centre sarkaar gend rajyon ke paale main daal sakati he
 Pressure on VAT reduction may increase After the Central Government appealed for a 5% VAT reduction, only a few states have reduced VAT
 petrol-dijal kii keemten agar yun hi badhati rahi, to rajyon par waite ghataane ko lekar dabaav bad saktaa he
 If other states including Maharashtra and Gujarat also get relief from VAT, then the price of petrol and diesel may be reduced
 daily prising ban rahi musiibat2016 main modi sarkaar ne jab rojanaapetrol or dijalki keemten tay karne kaa faisla liya tha, tab kaha gaya tha ki isse keemten ghatengi or aam aadmi ko raahat milegi, lekin aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Earlier, the impact of crude oil prices on the common people after 15 days
 ab har din kachche tel kii keemton main aa rahe badlaav kaa asar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Is GST the last way? Many including Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis have raised the demand to bring petrol and diesel under GST
 aise main petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat dilaane ke liye sarkaar ise jiesti ke tahat laane par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 a debate competition was held for the India Today Cup at Vasant Valley School, Delhi
 teen din tak chale is dibet main 22 alag alag skulon ke students ne hissaa liya
 The special thing about this competition was that students from outside the country also participated in it

 On the other hand, the children of Vasant Valley were also very excited to meet the children of different countries

 The union says that the service will start from April 7
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he 'seva cab' maujuuda ola or ubar se sasti daron par cab muhaiyaa karaayegi
 In a statement issued by Chalik Shakti Union, it said that from 17 to 31 March, drivers will start connecting with this app

 The comments maaloom ho ki isi saal farvari main ola or ubar se jude ek lakh se adhik driver anischitkaaleen hadtaal par chale gaye the
 The drivers demanded that they get better incentives as well as to stop adding new taxis with the app as it affects their booking (earnings)
 driveron kii isi maang ko dekhte hue 'seva cab' ap se judane vaale driveron ke liye khaas intjaam kiya he
 In lieu of ola-uber's commission of 27 per cent, the service cab has fixed a sum of only Rs 700 per month for the drivers, so that the maximum benefit goes to the driver's pocket

 aah, bechaare vaadi, jelon main apane din kaat rahe log
 His voice trembled a bit
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi kii taraf dekha or kaha, “vikaas or tarakkee ke naam par main aapse guzarish karata hum ki maukey kii najaakat ko samajhen or dekhen ki aalochana karnaa hi kaaphi nahin he
 The sentence was left unfinished, the stagnation between words became longer
 ek jatke main sir uthe or ankhen fail gayi
 This was the voice of the man who was struggling to stop his tongue from expressing his feelings
 magar yah mahaj koi shaks nahin tha
 Standing on the dais was 43rd Chief Justice Tirath Singh Thakur of the country
 unke jabade bhinche hue the, nazren phiri hui thim, unka haath apni ankhon ko ponchney ke liye roomaal kii talash main jeb main tha
 Silence enveloped Delhi's Vigyan Bhavan on 25 April, shocked and bewildered by each other
 pradhanmantri manch par baithe gambhir najaron se dekh rahe the
 In fact, it took the Chief Justice a total of 37 minutes and four seconds when he forced the nation to pay attention by surprise
 yah thik utana hi vakt he jisamen desh bhar main nyaayadhish ausatan 15 sunwaayeeyaan puri kar lete hai or saat mukademon kaa faisla kar dete hai
 This is because judges of the busiest courts average 2 in a trial hearing
 5 minute kharch karte hai or takreeban paanch minute main ek mukademe kaa faisla suna dete hai
 Not because our judges are in a hurry, but because there is such a shortage of judges in the country that they can hardly give more time to a trial
 jaisaa ki 3 march, 2016 ko loksabhaa main zikr kiya gaya tha, hycorton main 44 fisadi, nichali adaalaton main 25 fisadi or supreme court main 19 fisadi jajon kii kami he
 Four noble truths There were four aspects of the argument in the prime judge's arguments
 ek, jajon par mukademon kaa baari boj he
 Two, vacancies in the judiciary are not being filled
 teen, niyukti kii prakriya abujh vajahon se sarkaar ke str par ataki hui he
 Four, if the wheels of justice will not rotate smoothly, then the common man will suffer the most
 vidhi ayog 1987 se hi cheekh rahaa he, uske saath pichley 29 saal main bane 15 pradhan nyaayadhish bhi guhaar lagaate aa rahe hai ki adaalaton or jajon kii sankhya main baari badhotaree karne kii sakht jarurat he, tabhi insaaf kaa asal myne hoga
 But the headlines of this need had also stopped
 insaaf ke takaaje ke prati pradhan nyaayadhish kii jajbaati apil se yah phir surkhiyon main aa gaya he
 Later that same day, in a press conference, the Chief Justice said, "emotion is a sign of weakness, one should not be emotion
 
 
 magar nyaaypalika ke prati kuch patibaddhta bhi hoti he
 "it is the deliberate negligence of governments that has pushed the judiciary to such a state of scarcity," says noted legalist Ram Jethmalani
 ” ve yah bhi kehete hai, “nyaaypalika ko bajet aavantnon kaa mahaj 0
 Only 5 percent is available
 ” pradhan nyaayadhish ke aansuon ne pradhanmantri kaa bhi dhyaan khinchaa
 Modi was not scheduled to speak at that event on 25 April
 magar modi ne microphone haath main liya or kaha ki ve pradhan nyaayadhish kaa dard samajhate hai
 He invited the Chief Justice and his senior judges for a closed-door meeting with himself and his cabinet colleagues, "let's see how to reduce the burden of the past and move forward
" ”kathor kaarynitipradhan nyaayadhish ne supreme court ke vakeelon ko bhi hairat main daal diya
 Soft-spoken and patient Justice Thakur is also known for being angry and furious
 vakil aise anginat maukon kii zikr karte hai, jab unhone oonche or rasukhdaar logon ko aade haathon liya
 He explains, "senior advocate and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal was appealing for the release of Sahara chief Subrata Roy and the Chief Justice asked him to" argue on the basis of facts and laws, do not give us speech at all times
 ” ve bisisiai main sudhaar, sharada ghotaale or yahaan tak ki ganga safai ke pradhanmantri ke priy project kaa bhi hawala dete hai
 He is very famous to say to government lawyers that "ganga will not be cleaned even in 200 years by your action plan"
 ”kadai se nipatane kii unki is pratishtha ne nichali panktiyon tak main asamanjas or matbhed paidaa kar die hai
 Some lawyers expressed deep disappointment, “the Chief Justice has a very important place in our Constitution
 unhen pradhanmantri ke saamne ronaa nahin chahie tha
 "some could not muster this shock," the Chief Justice is known for his toughness
 adaalat main unke saamne varisht vakeelon ko bhi pasinaa aa jaataa he
 Some lawyers say that the Supreme Court could have issued the ultimate order or mandamus to the government to fulfill its duty
 duusare bataate hai ki kis tarah ise “nyaayik ati ke taur par dekha gaya hoga
 At the same time, some lawyers also believe that this was a strategic tone, "we need judges
" purnaviram
 The only way to draw people's attention to a desperate need, especially when the Modi government is bent on stalling all efforts for judicial reforms after its defeat over the NJAC
 ”ati kii pretchayavicitra baat yah he ki is lamhe ne modi sarkaar or nyaaypalika ke bich uthalputhal se bhare saal kii rahi-sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 On April 5 last year, a confrontation started from this very platform
 desh kii karypalika ke pramukh pradhanmantri narendra modi ne thik isi jagah nyaayapalika ko aade haathon liya tha or vah bhi saarvajanik taur par
 He had said, "the judiciary of India is becoming stronger at all levels, while at the same time it is also necessary that it should be able to meet the expectations of the people
" ”ek tareeke se yah aisi ghatana thi jisane bhartiya loktantr ke do stambhon ke bich maheenon chalane vaali takaraaron or takaraavon kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 This ultimately led to the failure of an important legislative effort of the Prime Minister
 sarkaar ne varisht jajon ke haathon apane phaayde ke hisaab se saathi jajon ko chunane vaali collegium pranali kii jagah lene ke liye chah sadasyon kaa ek engeesi bana diya
 This new commission would have given the executive the power to influence appointments and other ethics issues in higher courts
 britain ke uniwarsity of varavik main kanoon ke professor upendra bakshi kehete hai, “sarkaar ne bhale hi ise gale utaar liya ho, magar saaf he ki nyaaypalika or siyaasi tabake ke bich takaraav abhi khatm nahin hua he
 "it is not just about the NJAC
 nyaayik sakriyata or nyaayik ati ke bich kii maheen rekha tab tak nyaaypalika ko pareshaan karti rahegi, jab tak ki vah teji se apana ghar durust nahin karti
 Prominent jurist Fali s
 nariman sawaal karte hai ki unhen kaise niyukt kiya jaataa he? ve kyon niyukt kiye jate hai? unki kamiyaan kya hai? ve kehete hai, “unase puuchhie or ve kahenge, “isse aapkaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 We know what is good for the judiciary
 ” isaki jad main beshak collegium pranali hi he
 The root cause of ati's allegations is also in the top court's desire to investigate and prosecute cases
 engeesi kii naakaami ko kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ke lakrajon main “anirvachiton kii nirankushta” ke taur par dekha gaya tha
 The Chief Justice knows this
 2 disambar, 2015 ko bagdor sambhalate vakt unhone kaha tha, “nyaaypalika apane haal ke vakt kii sabase badi chunauti kaa saamana kar rahi he
 “the repeal of the NJAC Act created the impression in the minds of the people that the judiciary has acquired the right to appoint judges
 ab use desh bhar kii adaalaton main khaali pade padon ko bharne or unki ummiido par khara utarane kii jarurat he
 “while choosing the people for promotion to the Chief Justices and Supreme Court Judges, they should follow their conscience
 ”kuch to ho durustanyayik niyuktiyon ko aasaan or kargar banane ke liye pradhan nyaayadhish ne janvari main ek sanvaidhanik adaalat kii sthapana kii thi taaki samvidhan kii vyakhya karne se jude lambit maamalon kaa boj kam kiya ja sake
 But by February, things were not going in the right direction and the Chief Justice was calling for an "audit of the functioning of the government", blaming the government for "holding hands" with judicial appointments
 march se pradhan nyaayadhish sawaal uthaane lage ki khufia beuro ko supreme court ke collegium ke sifarish kiye gaye jajon kii tasdik karne main maheenon lanbaa vakt kyon laganaa chahie
 Pointing to the proposals for the appointment of 170 judges pending with the government for months, when 90 per cent of them are current judges, on 9 April, the Chief Justice asked that "the Prime Minister's Office should submit the report to IB within 15 days" Why can't i say? ”the Commercial Courts of the High Courts, Commercial Departments and Commercial Appellate Departments Act, 2015 passed in the Cold Session of Parliament
 Or
 iskaa makasad vanijyik mukademon se nipatane ke tareekon main badlaav laana or deree ko kam karnaa tha
 This has also been a stinging issue - new courts are being built out of the existing courts already facing the problem of many vacant posts without giving them manpower and infrastructure separately
 doosraa samaadhaan baar council ke liye ho saktaa he ki vah nyaayik acadamiyon ko zyada se zyada istemaal kare
 Academies are being set up in various states to impart training to judicial officers and lawyers

 The apex court has set a target of taking the total strength of the judiciary to 30,000 in five years

 The ease with which the adjournment is obtained from the courts needs to be controlled
 sunwaayee kii tarikhon ko aage badhaane se civil mukademon main deree hoti he
 By limiting reasonable grounds for adjournment and certain internal rules, along with strict instructions from the CJI, pending litigation can be substantially reduced

 a veteran judge once wrote that being a judge is "a privilege, a pleasure and a duty"
 pareshanhal or vyathit pradhan nyaayadhish saaf taur par na to hindustani jajon ke bhaichaare ke liye or na hi desh ke liye acha shagun hai
 Debates will continue for years on why and how

 The top ranks of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), which has more than 5,000 officers, excelled in the private sector and academic sector in June 2018, with the Narendra Modi-led NDA government fueled by the country's 164-year-old giant bureaucracy
 Decided to open for sanvaidhanik sweekruti se las sangh lok seva ayog kii pariksha ko bypass karte hue centre sarkaar ne ummidavaaron se aavedan aamantrit kiye, jinaki umr 40 saal se kam or anubhav 15 saal se zyada ho
 They are to be appointed as joint secretaries, who are said to be the brains of the top bureaucracy dealing with policy making
 inhen 10 ahm mahakamon main tainaat kiya jayega, ve mahakme or mantralay haih rajasav; vittiya sevaayen; aarthik maamle; krishi, sahyog or kisaan kalyaan; sadak parivahan or rajmarg; jahajrani; paryaavaran, van or jalwaayu mantralay; akshay urja; naagarik uddyan; or vaanijya
 This will add just 10 more specialists to the staff of the current 341 joint secretary
 inamen se 249 iees afasar hai, jo teen saal ke tayshuda kaarykaal ke liye niyukt kiye gaye hai, jise or do saal badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 This gives a glimpse of how fierce and challenging the task of reforming heavy and cumbersome bureaucracy is

 Pangadia, a big supporter of such appointments in the bureaucracy, says: "for the first time in the history of 70 years, the system is being opened to bring outside experts on the basis of competition in the bureaucracy

 Especially on the part of babus who mock the entry from the backstage, saying it is unconstitutional and contrary to the "public interest" objective of the administrative service

 Former law minister and chairman of the Second Administrative Reforms Commission, Veerappa Moily alleged: "the bjp-led NDA government wants to saffronise the civil service through backward appointments

 The English word "bureaucracy" (on the lines of which it is called bureaucracy or bureaucracy in Hindi) is derived from the French word "bureau" ie desk and the Greek word "kratos" meaning governance or rule

 hindustan kii afasarshahi prashasan ke british westminster model kii viraasat he
 Why did Azad Hindustan maintain a system which was born out of the arrogance of the British Raj? The country's first Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel wrote a letter to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948, in which he advocated a system of administrative service whose functioning was "purely in political concerns, both in recruitment and in its discipline and control
" If it cannot be finished, then it should be reduced to minimum
 ''haalanki samvidhan sabha ke kai sadsy prashasnic seva ko banaae rakhane ke khilaaf the or khud nehru ne bhi ise jari rakhane ko lekar anichhaa jaahir kii thi

 In Bihar, the opposition opposition and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav (tejashwi Yadav) are undergoing intense attacks against CM Nitish Kumar
 unhone (tejashwi Yadav) apane taaja bayaan main nitish kumaar ko naitik bhrashtachar kaa bhishma pitamah bataaya he
 Tejashwi Yadav also tweeted in this regard
 unhone (tejashwi Yadav) likhaa ki bhartiya raajnneeti main aisa koi nahin he jo nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke str kaa ho
 He is Bhishma Pitamah of moral corruption not only politically but also at moral or social level
 tejasvi (tejashwi Yadav) ne aage kaha ki aap nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ko bhi abhi bhi apni galati maanate nahin dekhenge
 He always blames his allies and opposition for his mistakes
 No one in Indian polity matches the standards of Nitish Kumar Ji
 Not only he is politically, morally or socially scandalous but Bhishma Pitamah of moral corruption
 You will never find him accepting his blunders
 He always blames partners as well as opponents for his mistakes
 https: / / t
 co / vb5wbnrzqm Explain that this is the second time in the last two days that Tejashwi Yadav has spoken on Nitish Kumar
 isse pehle unhone kaha tha ki nitish kumaar dwaara prashanth kishor ko party kaa upaadhyaksh banane kaa faisla nitish kumaar kaa apana nahin tha
 This decision was taken at the behest of BJP President Amit Shah
 yah tejasvi yadav ne is babat ek twit bhi kiya tha kiya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki nitish kumaar ne yah mana ki jadyu bijepi kaa advance varjan he
 This is the reason why he is giving all constitutional posts apart from him by asking Amit Shah
 ummid karata hum ki ab aap samaj paaenge ki aakhir rajya main mob linching or aparaadh ek aam baat si kyon ho gai he
 Finally Nitish Kumar admits that JDU is the advanced version of BJP therefore he is giving all important organizational posts except him to the people chosen by Sh
 Amit Shah
 Hope now you understand, Why Mob Lynchings & State Sponsored Crimes have become a routine practice in Bihar? It is worth noting that earlier Bihar Chief Minister and JDU National President Nitish Kumar had revealed that he had made Prashant Kishore the National Vice President of JDU (JDU) at the behest of BJP President Amit Shah
 nitish kumaar ne is baat kaa khulaasa ek nijee channel ke kaarykram main kiya
 Nitish Kumar said that Amit Shah had called him twice to give Prashant Kishore a position in JDU
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki unhen bhi prashanth kishor se sneh rahaa he
 On the question of giving responsibility to Prashant Kishore, Nitish said that at the moment he has been given the responsibility to connect the youth with the party
 nitish kumaar ne is kaarykram main apane uttaradhikari ke bare main sawaal puche jane par jawaab diya tha ki ye janata tay karegi
 Along with this, he had said that Prashant Kishore has been appointed on the advice of two top BJP leaders
 nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki prashanth kishor ko upaadhyaksh banane ke faisle main unke alaava or bhi kai log shaamil the
 When Prashant Kishor was included in Nitish Kumar in JDU, an attempt was made by Prashant Kishore's team himself and that he be considered second in the party after Nitish Kumar
 bataa den, kishor ko pichley saal sitambar main jad (you) main shaamil kiya gaya tha or kuch hi hafte baad unhen party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh bana diya gaya tha
 This led to speculation that Kumar was thinking of making him his political successor
 nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki vah hamaare liye nae nahin hai
 He worked with us in the 2015 and assembly elections
 thode samay ke liye vah kahin or vyast the
 Please let me know that Amit Shah twice asked me to include Kishore in JD (U)
 'saath hi unhone kaha tha ki prashanth kishor ko samaaj ke sabhi tabake se yuva pratibhaaon ko raajnneeti kii ore aakarshith karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 Those not born in political families have lost access to politics
 mujhe prashanth kishor se kaaphi lagaav he
 But, we should not do such things as successors
 yah rajshahi nahin he

 'haalanki sapa ne kanoon-vyavastha kaa hawala dete hue ek baar phir saaf kiya he ki parikrama yatra ko ijaajat nahin milegi
 SP MP Naresh Aggarwal said, 'vhp's Parikrama Yatra is completely inspired by politics

 At the same time, BJP is denouncing this decision as wrong

 On the other hand, sages and saints also believe that the UP government has cheated them

 He alleged that the Prime Minister was aware of all decisions related to the 2G spectrum scam
 lekin unhone tufaan aane par apana sir ret main chhipaana behatar samajha
 On the Congress accusation of PAC President Murli Manohar Joshi for doing politics in the Parliamentary Committee, he said that it has become a noise like a thief
 gadakari ne kaha, in ghotaalon ke nirmaataa or nirdeshak sonia gandhi or manmohan singh hai
 He also surrounded Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, saying that while going to Vietnam, he praised the PAC, while his fellow ministers stayed behind the scenes during the last meeting of the committee and remained silent
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pehle hi saaf kar diya tha ki pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif se baatcheet main kuch khaas ummid rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 The same thing happened after the meeting, but Manmohan Singh's attitude during the meeting was enough to tell that Pakistan's attitude on the issue of terror will not be tolerated
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne ravivaar ko neuyork main pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke saath baithak main pakistan ko dehshatgardi rokane ke liye paak kade kadam uthaane ke liye kaha
 He spoke to Nawaz Sharif on terrorism, economic issues, Siachen issues, ceasefire violations

 The meeting between the two Prime Ministers for nearly an hour was not a major achievement

 For the record, India's National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon told the media that the meeting was "cordial, useful and constructive"
 ' media bifring main bharat ke saath saath pakistani patrkaar bhi maujuud the
 Singh told Sharif that peace on the Line of Control is a precondition for improving relations
 donon netaa niyantran rekha par halaat sudhaarney par sahamat hue jahaan pakistan kii ore se sanghasharviraam kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he
 The Prime Minister had this conversation unaffected by bjp's demand to cancel the meeting due to this violation

 He called for effective steps to be taken to punish the perpetrators of the 26 / 11 terror attacks in Mumbai
 unhone kaha ki yah baatcheet jammu ke sameep guuruuvaar ko hue dohare aatanki hamale kii dukhad prishthbhumi main ho rahi he
 In connection with the investigation of Mumbai attack in Pakistan, Sharif said that action will be taken against the conspirators
 is silsile main unhone apane desh kii ek nyaayik samiti kaa haal main bharat daure kaa ullekh kiya
 Significantly, India is not satisfied with the progress of the Mumbai attack investigation in Pakistan
 sharif ne kaha ki pakistan bhi aatankwaad se peedit he
 Asked how hopeful the Indian side is about Pakistan's action on India's concerns, Menon said the evidence of success and the significance of the meeting will be known in the coming months
 unhone kaha ki donon netaaon ne sambandh behatar karne kii ichha jaahir kii lekin agle daur kii vaarta ke bare main koi nirnay nahin kiya gaya
 In another media briefing located five blocks away from Menon's media briefing, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Abbas Jilani described the meeting as 'highly positive and useful'
 unhone kaha, 'mukhya udeshy anukool maahaul bananaa or sabhi lambit muddon ko suljhaana tha
 The two leaders committed to resolve all issues
 ' jilani ne bataaya ki singh ne is baat par bal diya ki kshetra main shanti behaal karne ke liye jammu kashmir, siachin or sar creek sahit sabhi muddon kaa hal jaruri he
 He said that the two leaders discussed the situation on the Line of Control and agreed that the agreement made in the year 2004 should be obeyed very accurately
 sharif ne kaha ki donon deshon ke paas shantipurna vaarta jari rakhane ke alaava or koi chaara nahin he
 Jilani said, 'terrorism was discussed
 ham aatankwaad par aapaki chintaaon se avgat hai, or mujhe lagata he ki bhartiya paksh bhi hamaari chintaaon se waakif he
 Jilani said that Sharif also spoke of 'external interference' being carried out by India in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan
 brifing main menon ne baluchistan main bharat ke dakhsandaji ke aaropon ko puri tarah nakaarte hue kaha, 'iskaa koi saboot nahin he
 If there is any evidence, we have not seen it
 ' ek pakistani patrkaar ke sawaal par ki pakistan main aatankwaad kii dhuree bharat he, menon ne palat kar kaha, 'maine aisi kisi bhi chintaa kii baat nahin suni he
 If there is any evidence, we will look into it
 bharat ke aatankwaad kaa prasar karne kaa kahin koi pramaan nahin he
 i wish i could say that the situation is actually the opposite
 'yah puche jane par ki kya sena or sharif ke vichaar samaan hai, jilani ne kaha, 'pakistan main sabhi sansthaanon ke vichaar samaan hai
 There is a misconception about this
 pakistan main nirnay lene kii prakriya vahi he jo sabhi loktantric deshon main hoti he
 
 sabhi nirnay sahmati se liye jate hai
 'jilani claimed that 26
 11 main hue mumbai hamalon kii jaanch kii prakriya dhimi padane kii vajah nyaayik ayog kii bharat yatra main vilamb he
 The judicial commission will submit its report after the visit and only then will the hearing process be expedited
 jilani ne kaha ki kashmir bahut mahatvapurn mudda he or iskaa hal jaruri he
 He said, 'prime Minister Sharif raised this issue in the meeting
 hamane dekha ki donon pakshon main is mudde ko sadbhaavpurn maahaul main hal karne kii baraabar kii ichha dikhaayi padi
 "there is no alternative to peaceful, continuous and uninterrupted dialogue," Jilani said

 If we compare with Tibet, Kashmir is not the issue
 lekin nehruvian soch or sarkari afasaron kii lalaphitaashahee ne aaj kashmir ko islamabad se lekar neuyork tak mudda bana rakhaa he
 In 1949 there were only 400 natives of China in Lhasa (tibet) and about 30 thousand Tibetans
 1992 main china ke mul nivasee vahaan 400 se badhkar 50,000 ho gaye, jabaki tibeti koi 90 hajaar
 China has made a dent in the population of Tibet in a very planned way
 iske alaava 20 hajaar karod rupee kii tibet-china rail project ne donon kshetron ko ek patari se baandh diya
 Shanghai's school project brought changes in language and culture
 asar ye hua kii nai sahastrabdi ke tibet main dalai lamas hi paradeshi ho gaye
 China also found its own lama

 If there is no money in the pocket, then first of all, it affects the daily needs, in such a situation, when fifty days of demonetisation have passed and the cash crisis is also going on, then it becomes imperative to find the answer to this question financially
 How did the life of a person standing on the rungs pass
 is lihaaz se notebandi ke pachaas dinon main jindagi mushkil hui yaa phir sabakuch patari par he, jaanane kii sabase acchhee jagah he rehadi-patari bazaar
 There is one such place between South Ex and AIIMS, where many eating hawks are available
 yahaan log subah-subah naashtaa karne se lekar dopaher kaa khaanaa bhi sasti daron me kha sakate hai
 In the life of the common man, what changed after demonetisation in his plate? saath hi dukandaaron ke halaat ko bhi janaa, unke vyapaar par notebandi kaa kya kuch asar padaa yaa phir sabakuch pehle kii tarah saamaanya hi he
 As soon as people questioned Naan, who fed naan and dal makhni, what was the situation, his businessman, answered with astonishment did not matter
 khaanaa kha rahe raamalaal ne bhi yahi baat doharaai
 There was a shortage of cash, but arrangements have been made according to the need like eating food
 lekin pani kii rehadi lagane vaale santosh ke jawaab main thodi talkhi thi
 Santosh said that his business has been affected after the demonetisation
 logon ke paas chuttay paise nahin the, to pani pine se bhi parhez kiya
 Sawan Kumar, who set up a shop for abandoned shops, said that there has been a slowdown in the business, not only at the level of customers but also had to face problems in bringing goods from the market
 chhole chaaval vaale surendra kii shikaayat bhi kuch isi tarah kii thi
 According to Surendra, after demonetisation, people have had problems, but their business is related to food and drink, in which people are compelled that they will come to eat, that is why the business did not slow down, but the complaints of people definitely got heard
 
 surendra ke mutabik cash kii kami se lekar chuttay tak kii samasya se unako is dauraan jujhna padaa
 Another special thing was that cashless facility was not available at any of these shops

 ' Shatrughan Sinha, who has been angry with the BJP for a long time, joined the Congress on Saturday
 congress main shaamil hote hi shotgan ko patna sahib se tikat de diya gaya he, jiske baad ab patna sahib se shatrughna sinha sidhe taur par bijepi ke kaddavar netaa or kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad se do-do haath karenge
 On the day of bjp's foundation day, Shatrughan, who left the BJP and came to the courtyard of the Congress, fired tremendous shells against PM Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah
 shatrughna kii sithasi parisal 1984 main jab shatrughna ne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party kaa camel thama to party ne unke damdaar vyaktitv or joardaar aawaaj ke kaaran unhen us samay party kaa star prachaarak bana diya
 In 1992, Shatrughan was first fielded against Rajesh Khanna from the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 shatrughna sinha ne ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki apane dost rajesh khanna ke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa unki zindagi kaa sabase bada regreat he
 Subsequently, in the years 1996 and 2002, the NDA sent him to the Rajya Sabha
 2003 or 2004 main cabinet mantri banane ke baad saal 2009 or 2014 main bihar kii patna sahib seat ne unhen saansad ke taj se nawaja
 It is said that Lal Krishna Advani, who has retired from his own party today, brought the enemy into politics
 vakt kaa takaaza dekhie aaj, na to adwani bijepi main rahe or na hi shatrughna party ke rahe
 The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was so impressed with the enemy that Sinha made Atal ji as Health Minister in 2003 and in 2004 as Shipping Minister
 gauratlab he ki vah aise pehle abhinayta hai jo kendriya mantri bane
 Shatrughan, who won the general elections from Patna Sahib in 2009 and 2014, is currently the 16th Lok Sabha MP
 kyon choda ‘camel’aaj jis patna sahib kii seat ko lekar sinha bijepi ke ‘shatru’ bane, vah saal 2009 main pehali baar vahaan se chunaav jite or saansad bane
 After this, in the 2014 general elections, Shotgun again won a spectacular victory from Patna Sahib, despite this, the BJP high command cut his ticket from Patna Sahib for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 and handed over Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad
 shatrughna ke tikat par jab ravishankar prasad patna sahib pahunche to sinha kii naaraazgi bijepi netritv ko lekar khulkar saamne aane lagi
 He continued to make rhetoric against the BJP
 sarkaar ke faislon kii vah khule manchon se aalechana karne lage
 His rebellious attitude started to get stronger when Mamata Banerjee's call on January last reached Kolkata in a grand alliance rally
 vahaan jaakar manch se hi shatrughna ne lagbhag spasht kar diya tha ki vah party se kinaaraa kar vipaksh ke saath khadey hai
 Patna's capital 'patna' was divided into two parts according to the Lok Sabha constituency in 2008
 pehla loksabhaa kshetra patna sahib bana or doosraa patliputra
 In the first election held in Patna Sahib in 2009, Shatrughan Sinha hoisted the winning flag
 iske baad 2014 ke aam chunaavon main bhi bihari babu patna sahib loksabhaa se vijayi rahe
 Significantly, the election of Patna Sahib was held from the beginning among the film stars, but each time Baji Bihari Babu killed it
 shotgan ne saal 2009 main filmi sitare shekhar suman or 2014 main kunal singh ko isi loksabhaa se haraaya
 Patna Sahib Lok Sabha constituency consists of 6 assembly constituencies, out of which BJP is in the seats of Bakhtiyarpur, Digha, Bankipur, Kumharrar and Patna Sahib
 vahiin, fatuha seat argedy ke naam he
 It is said that there are more number of Yadav, Rajput and Kayastha voters in Patna Sahib
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki bijepi ne shatrughna sinha kii jagah kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ko tikat diya

 All the stalwarts present in the meeting were present in Delhi, besides Amit Shah, Ram Lal, Smriti Irani, Nirmala Sitharaman, Prakash Javadekar and Meenakshi Lekhi

 bahut si maanon kii tarah sheril leach bhi apane kishor bete ko hothon par kis karti hai
 Their son Jordan will be around 16 years old
 paanch foot chaar inch lambey jordan ko ab bhi ye bataane kii jarurat padati he kii use apane mojey farsh par nahin phenkane chahie
 He still needs to explain many small things
 baavjood iske sheril ko usase koi shikaayat nahin he
 When Jordan returns from school, he throws his school bag on the floor and lies down on the couch
 vahiin sheril dur khadi use pyaar se niharti rahati hai
 After some time she comes to him and holds his face with his palms and kisses her lips
 kya ye aakhri vaakya padhane menapako kuch atapata laga?agar aapako bhi kis karne kii baat kuch ajeeb lagi to bataa den ki aisa mahasoos karne vaale aap akele nahin he
 What should parents do or not on the lips of their children? This question has become a matter of debate
 kuch log ise pyaar jataane kaa ek tarika maanate hai to kuch kaa kahana he ki ye sahi nahin he
 It should be seen as violence
 pichley saal bal-manovaigyanik doctor shaiyrlot rejnik ko isi sawaal ke chalate vivaadon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 They used to say that what do you do on the lips of your child but till what age? Kissing on the lips is right until the child is aware of sex and related things
 lekin sexual awarenes aa jane ke baad bachche ko uske hothon par kis karnaa sahi nahin
 This can cause excitement in him
 iske saath hi maa or bete ko lip tu lip kis karata dekhnaa dusron ke liye asahaj bhi ho saktaa he
 Many times, they feel that they are a couple, which is not true in any situation
 vahiin shaiyrlot is vivaad ko puri tarah bakawaas bataati hai
 She says she will never stop kissing Jordan
 jab jordan se yahi sawaal poocha gaya to unka bhi yahi kahana tha ki wo bachapan se aisa karte aae hai or unhen ye bilkul saamaanya lagata he
 Her husband left her while she was pregnant
 shaiyrlot or jordan ne jindagi ke kuch saal ek-duusare ke saath hi bitaye hai
 Although now Sherlot has remarried, but since that time the relationship between mother and son has deepened
 yahi vajah bhi he ki unhen aisa karne main koi aapatti nahin he
 Sherlot says that Jordan slept on my bed for many years and has also shared her eagerness with sex
 jordan kii ek mahila dost bhi he par use jordan kii is aadat se koi dikkat nahin
 While parents like Sherlot consider it as a way of expressing their love for the child, children like Jordan see it as support
 unhen isamen koi buraai najar nahin aati
 But psychologists believe that it is not right to kiss children lip-to-lip after having sexual awareness
 madhyapradesh main bhale hi congress kii sarkaar aa gai ho, lekin bhaajapa ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ke bayanon se saaf najar aa rahaa he ki bhaajapa congress ke liye kadam-kadam par dikkatein khadi karne vaali he
 Former BJP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has surrounded the Congress government through two statements
 kal budhani ke kaaryakartaaon kii ek sabha ke dauraan unhone kaaryakartaaon se kaha darane kii jarurat nahin abhi tiger jinda he
 Shivraj raised the question mark by raising the question that the Congress government would last 5 years
 kya 13 saalon tak mukhyamantri rahe shivaraj singh chouhan kaa kursi moh abhi bhi nahi chuta he? kya shivaraj abhi bhi satta ja sapane dekh rahe hai? kya bina bahumat ke bani congress sarkaar ko badalanaa chaahate hai shivaraj? ye sawaal shivaraj ke us bayaan ke baad uth rahe hai jisamen shivaraj bolte dikh rahe hai ki 'unki vaapasi main shaayad 5 saal bhi naa lage'
 Yes, on Wednesday, Shivraj Singh Chauhan held his last program at CM House and met the workers of Budhni, his constituency
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha is dom main yah aakhri kaarykram he yah sunate hi vahaan baithi mahila kaaryakarta oonche swar main bol uthi, ''bhaiya, paanch saal baad phir aaenge
 "on this, former CM Shivraj Singh said," May not even five be completed
 ''shivaraj yaheen nahin ruke, unhone khud ko tiger bataate hue kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki 'haar se unhen chintaa karne kii zarurat nahi he kyonki tiger abhi zindaa he' bijepi netaaon ke bayaan bhi ishaara kar rahe hai ki bijepi main kuch khichdi to pak rahi he
 Former CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan BJP has not lost but is backward in arithmetic of seats
 vot zyada praapt karne ke baad bhi ham siton se pichad gaye lekin ab chaukeedaari kaa kaam hamaare paas he or isliye phir doharaata hum vikaas main sakaaratmak sahyog lekin janata ko pareshaani agar hui to maine janata ko kaha he chintaa kii baat nahi janata kaa haq dilaayenge
 At the same time, the BJP state president also said that this government is a weak government and therefore we do not know how much this government will run due to their mutual reasons
 'abhi bhi satta ke sapane dekh rahe shivaraj'- congresswahin congress ne mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke bayaan par kaha he ki bhaajapa haar kii maansikta se ubar nahin pai he ki janata ne use parajeet kar diya he
 Congress spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said that Shivraj still has dreams of power
 ajtak se baat karte hue pankaj chaturvedi ne kaha ki 'mujhe lagata he ki shivaraj ko chahie ki loktantric prakriya kaa paalan karke congress kii sarkaar bani he or jo janamat he uskaa sammaan sabko karnaa chahie
 i accept that you had a government for 15 years in which you were CM for 13 years, then it is very difficult to remain without power
 purv mukhyamantri ko rah rahakar satta ke swapn aaenge, jatke unhen lagenge'

 Salman Khan has gifted Eid to his fans with the release of India
 is film main wo sab he jo ek manoranjan karne vaali masala film main hona chahie
 Or rather, Salman Khan has prepared the gift of India by creating a complete package of entertainment
 ye film salmaan ke phens ke liye to blocbster he, isamen do raay nahin he
 But how is the film made under the direction of Ali Abbas Zafar, read the review
 salmaan khan kii bharat shuru hoti he aazaadee ke din 15 agast 1947 se
 This day is born in India (birthday of Salman Khan)
 ab jab berthde he to celibrasion bhi hoga, to is celibrasion kii shuruyaat hoti he ataari border par puure parivaar ke saath jaakar, chalati train ke peeche bhaagate hue kek kaatane se
 But before cutting the cake, India tells the story of the children at home, the story starts from here
 ye kahani he bharat-pakistan ke us bantwaare kii jisamen bharat yani salmaan ne apane stesan master pita (jaiki shroff) or choti bahan ko kho diya
 10 year old India starts looking for both and he turns 70
 is bich bharat kii jarney, sarkas se arab or malta se hote hue hindustan tak aati he
 In the meantime, he gets many characters who bring a significant twist in the story like Madam Sir (katrina Kaif), Vileeti (sunil Grover), Asif Sheikh
 kahani main kitna damafilm salmaan khan kii ho to cinema ke tamaam kaayade salmaan kii maujuudagi ke aage unke prashasankon ko kam najar aate hai
 By the way, if you take a close look at the story of the film, then one person has written all the characters around India
 haalanki salmaan kii pichhali film res 3 kii tulana main bharat kii kahani sulajhi hui he
 This time the film has an action zero and the emotional drama is full
 drama kahin kahin bahut zyada ho gaya jo yatharth najar nahin aata
 Like Salman arriving in Arabia and then appearing in Malta
 ek hi aadmi ke sarkas se lekar navy tak kaa safar filmi zyada najar aata he
 Well Script has the full spice of entertainment
 or kahani ko bhi usee ke lihaaj se buna gaya he
 If Salman is there then everything is possible
 film main dialogs achche hai, kamedi kaa tadakaa bhi jabardast he
 Talking about the performance of actor Khan, he impresses
 puri film main salmaan rob dekhne laayak he
 But it is quite fun to see Salman, 70 years old
 is luk main salmaan ko dekhakar hansi zyada aati he
 Can one get old by applying white beard hair? Katrina's role is good compared to her earlier roles
 magar film main jo asli panch he wo hai sunil grover
 Sunil's comic timing is tremendous
 ve kai baar film bachaate najar aate hai
 Asif Sheikh's role may be small, but powerful
 tabboo, sonaali kulkarni ne bhi apane kirdaaron ke saath bakhubi insaaf kiya he
 Ali Abbas Zafar's direction should also be praised because he has not allowed India's story to become cumbersome
 sampadan or lokation kai jagah prabhavi hai
 Overall, Salman's fans will love the story of India
 id par film kaa relies hona nirmaataaon ke liye phydemand sauda he
 Do not be surprised if India bumper at the box office

 is twit ke hawaale se kai internet yugers ne pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya
 It is said that the Prime Minister has given such a figure about the houses built by his government, which is almost impossible
 congress ke anusuchit jati (SC) prakoshth or party ke rashtriya sanyojak ruchira chaturvedi ne bhi NDTV ke twit ko ritvit kiya

 The Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson said that the CBI and Income Tax raid is like a show in which a new episode has been added
 'aap' ko vishwaas he ki pichhali kai red kii tarah is red main bhi koi saboot nahin milegaa
 During a press conference organized by AAP after the income tax raid, Atishi alleged that PM Modi, BJP president Amit Shah wants to stop the Kailash Gehlot battle in an unconstitutional way, so today his house was raided but we Amit Shah And tell the PM that put any agency behind us, we will not be afraid
 unhone aage kaha, 'ham har tarah kii jaanch ke liye shuruyaat se taiyaar hai or modi sarkaar se poochna chaahate hai ki desh main kya sirf aam aadmi party yaa unke mantri hi hai jinke khilaaf karrwai kii jaati he?'udhar, 'aap' vidhayak alka lamba ne bhi modi sarkaar par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki desh ke beyimaan chaukeedaar vijay maalya, neerav modi ko bhagane main madad karte hai, wo saadhe 3 saal main kai red karvaa chuke hai

 We will take a fight against this conspiracy on the streets
