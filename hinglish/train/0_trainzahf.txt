 Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was a victim of the party's curved vision as he praised the Prime Minister's cleanliness campaign, today participated in a cleanliness program on the outskirts of the state capital, remembering Mahatma Gandhi and saying that he would not hand Gandhi over to Narendra Modi
 Will leave unhone kaha ki desh ko svachh rakhana ek rashtriya sarokaar he or unke dwaara iskaa samarthan karne ke koi raajnneetik myne nahin nikaale jane chahie
 Tharoor participated in a garbage cleaning program by local residents in the coastal town of Vizhinjam here in his parliamentary constituency
 iske baad unhone apane aalochakon ko shant karwaane ke prayaas main kaha, 'vaise bhi yah koi bhaajapa kaa abhiyaan nahin he
 
 main modi ke liye gandhiji ko nahin chhoduunga
 
 main modi ke liye (sardaar) patel ko nahin chhoduunga
 ' is maah ke shuru main kerala pradesh congress samiti (kepisisi) ke dabaav main tharur ko akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke pravaktaa pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 The KPCC had requested the party leadership to ban Tharoor for praising initiatives like Modi and his Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 abhiyaan main apni sakriy bhagidaari kaa bachaav karte hue tharur ne kaha, 'yah kisi ek raajnneetik dal kaa visheshadhikaar nahin he or apane aasapaas kii jagah ko svachh rakhane kaa sandesh pehali baar mahatma gandhi ne diya tha
 ' samvaadadaataaon ne unase yah sawaal kiya tha ki kya unke is kadam ko party kii chetavanee ke ulanghan ke rup main pesh nahin kiya jayega
 To this, he said, 'gandhiji said that cleanliness is more important than independence
 lekin gandhi ke liye man evam sharir kii shuddhta bhi utani hi mahatvapurn thi jiskaa arth he ki dil se ghrinaa or hinsa ko dur kiya jaae
 ' kerala kii rajdhani se pichhali do baar se saansad ne kaha ki eisisi ne party kaaryakartaaon se yah bhi kaha tha ki ve do aktubar se shuru hone vaale ek maah ke swatchta abhiyaan main shaamil hon
 The Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh was formed in Punjab today with the end of 10 years of rule of Akali dal-bjp
 captain kii cabinet main nau mantriyon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 It also included another popular name with Navjot Singh Sidhu
 darasal manpreet badal ko bhi cabinet mantri banaaya gaya
 Manpreet Badal belongs to the family and is the son of former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's brother
 ek samay akali dal main manpreet badal(55) kii acchhee khaasi hanak thi
 He was an MLA from the Akali Dal from 1995 to 2012 and was Finance Minister in the Parkash Singh Badal government from 2007-10
 vah prakaash singh badal ke bhai gurdas singh badal ke putr hai
 In 2010, he was removed from the ministerial post for having a different opinion within his party on the central government's debt waiver decision
 uske baad usee saal oktober main shiromani akali dal se unako nikaal diya gaya
 He then formed the People's Party of Punjab (PPP) and contested in the 2012 elections along with other smaller parties
 vah khud do jagahon se un chunaavon main ummidavaar the
 However his party's performance was very poor and he himself lost from his two seats
 party kaa bhi kahin khaataa nahin khul sakaa
 After that in the 2014 elections, Manpreet contested against Sukhbir Singh Badal's wife Harsimrat Kaur but could not achieve success
 uske baad pichley saal janvari main unki party kaa congress main vilay ho gaya
 He has traditionally contested from Giddarbaha seat in Punjab
 tippaniyan At one time, Manpreet Badal (55) had a good liking in the Akali Dal
 vah 1995 se 2012 tak akali dal kii taraf se emele the or 2007-10 tak prakaash singh badal sarkaar main vitt mantri the
 He is the son of Gurdas Singh Badal, brother of Parkash Singh Badal
 2010 main centre sarkaar ke karj maafee ke faisle par apni party ke bheetar alag raay rakhane kii vajah se unako mantri pad se hataa diya gaya
 He was then expelled from the Shiromani Akali Dal in October the same year
 uske baad unhone pipuls party of punjab (pipipi) kaa gathan kiya or 2012 ke chunaav main anya chote dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa
 He himself was a candidate in those elections from two places
 haalanki unki party kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa or vah khud apni do siton se haar gaye
 The party's account could not be opened anywhere
 uske baad 2014 ke chunaav main manpreet ne sukhbir singh badal kii patni harsimrat cor ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa lekin safalataa hasil nahin kar sake
 After that, his party merged with the Congress in January last year
 vah paramparaagat rup se punjab kii giddarbaha seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 The comments uske baad unhone pipuls party of punjab (pipipi) kaa gathan kiya or 2012 ke chunaav main anya chote dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa
 He himself was a candidate in those elections from two places
 haalanki unki party kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa or vah khud apni do siton se haar gaye

 vah paramparaagat rup se punjab kii giddarbaha seat se chunaav ladate rahe hai
 The comments himachal pradesh ke kinnaur jile main guuruuvaar ko yatriyon se khachaakhach bhari mini bas ke baspa nadi main gir jane se kam se kam 23 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 20 log ghayal ho gaye
 Officials said the death toll could increase as the condition of several people in the injured was critical
 durghatana sthal par maujuud upayukta didi sharma ne kaha ki 40 yatriyon se bhari bas kalpa se sangla ja rahi thi
 The bus near Sangla fell into the river 300 feet below the road
 unhone durghatanasthal se phone par bataaya ki ghayal 11 yatriyon ko hawaii jahaaj se shimla sthit indira gandhi medical college evam aspataal bheja gaya he
 The cause of the accident is not known
 police adheekshak rahul nath ne kaha ki bas satluj kii sahaayak nadi baspa main gir gai
 Witnesses said that the police had a lot of trouble in removing the bodies from the bus
 durghatana vaali jagah par barish ke kaaran sadak behad kharaab thi
 The area's police started a rescue operation even before the district officials arrived
 adhikansh peedit kinnaur jile ke hai
 Kinnaur is one of the remote areas of the state
 yahaan behad kam basen chalati hai, jiske kaaran basen yatriyon se khachaakhach bhari hoti hai
 This is the second major accident in the state in less than a month
 mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne is ghatana par samvednaa jataai
 He directed the district administration to take all possible steps to save the victims
 modi sarkaar ab mishan 2019 ko dhyaan main rakh dhire-dhire or kaaphi sochsamajh kar apane kadam badha rahi he
 The Modi government is doing its best that till now it can be seen as public welfare
 mahangaai kii maar main dabi janata ko ubaarane ke naam par kendra sarkaar kii ore se petrol, dijal ke utpaada shulk main do rupee prati litre kii katautee isi kii baangi bhar thi
 This was also reflected in PM Modi's speech on Wednesday at the Golden Jubilee function of The Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI)
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main is baat kaa zikr kiya tha ki agar jaruri hua to jiesti main kuch badlaav bhi kiye ja sakate hai
 Preparations to blame the states According to political experts, the failure of some schemes of the Center, which failed to do better than expected, may be blamed on the Modi government and their ministers in the coming times
 iske peeche bhi modi sarkaar kii manshaa awam main apni chhavi lokahitaishi sarkaar kii banaae rakhane kii hi he
 The Center will try to give a message to as many people as possible that their plans were better but they failed because of the failure of the states
 bijepi shasit rajyon main daam kam kar dabaav banane kii koshishmahangaai kii maar jhel rahi janata ko raahat dene ke liye kendra sarkaar bijepi shasit rajyon par rosemara kii chizon par daam kam karne kaa dabaav banane kii taiyaari main he
 It has started with the demand for reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel
 aane vaale samay main kuch or jaruri chijen bhi sasti ho sakati hai
 The BJP wants to somehow prove that it is not doing anything to protect the public even after facing its losses
 or janata ko sasti chijen uplabdh karaane kii harsambhav koshish kar rahi he
 Message in the public - Center is not providing work, states are not giving it; Along with this, the Central Government also wants to send a message to the public that states do not have a better attitude in implementing whatever public welfare scheme or rules
 desh kii aarthik haalat or kam jidipi ke peeche kendra sarkaar rajya-kendra ke bich behatar saamanjasy kaa naa hona prachaarit karne kii taiyaari main he
 At present, BJP is in power in 17 states
 kendra kii vifal yojanaon kaa thikra bhi phodne kii taiyaarikendra kaushal vikaas, jandhan khaataa, ujjwala yojana jaisi badi yojanaon kii vifaltaa kaa thikra rajya sarkaron par phodne kii taiyaari main he
 The Center is not ready to take its head in any way due to the poor performance of its schemes
 modi sarkaar ko puri ummid he ki bijepi shasit rajya bhale hi petrol-dijal par waite kam kar den lekin punjab, tripura, pashchim bengal jaise rajya jahaan bijepi kii dhuravirohi partiyaan satta main hai shaayad hi kendra kii apil manjuur ho
 In such a situation, the Modi government can also blame them for spoiling their plans
 jharkhand ke mukhyamantri raghubar das achaanak ormanjhi kshetra main tundahuli panchayat ke tahat aanevaale aara gaanv pahunche
 He spent time with the villagers there, listened to their experiences and took suggestions
 unhone kaha ki 'nasha mukt gaanv banane par aara or keram ko ek lakh rupee kii protsaahan raashi di jaaegi
 Our government is working with the goal of eradicating poverty from Jharkhand
 rojgaar se jod kar har saal yojanabaddh tareeke se bipiel parivaar ko garibi rekha se baahar kiya jaayegaa
 BPL card will be made free to the village
 aara or keram gaanv main bhi 15-20 bipiel parivaar hai, jinhen johaar yojana ke tahat rojgaar se joda jaayegaa
 With this, these families will also be freed from the BPL category
 ' The Chief Minister said that with the de-addiction, the thinking and conduct of the people of the village has changed
 yah badi safalataa he
 Not having open defecation reduces the risk of diseases in the village
 ham chaahate hai ki gaanv kii janata jaagruk ho jaye
 The government will directly pay developmental funds to such villages
 gaanv ke log jarurat ke mutabik iskaa upyog kar sakenge
 We are working with the goal of giving water to every farm for every hand
 ' tippaniyan He said that the biggest means of ending poverty is education

 ) narendra modi ke ek naare se aisa siyaasi tufaan machaa ki unhen safai ke liye sabooton ke saath hajir hona padaa
 a 9-year-old video was released towards Narendra Modi surrounded by accusations of Obama's flattery
 is video ke jariye ye sabit karne kii koshish hui kii modi ne jo naaraa diya wo obama kaa nahin balki unka apana tha
 'yes we can, yes will do', as soon as Narendra Modi's efforts to energize the youth, there was a barrage of gifts
 naare main nakal najar aane lagi
 The relation of this slogan given in Hyderabad began to connect with America across the seven seas
 yaad aayaa ki paanch saal pehle yahi naaraa de kar to obama duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk kii sabase oonchi gaddi hasil kar lee thi
 If you leave aside the way of speaking, then both statements do not show much difference
 to kya narendra modi chal pade he obama kii chaal
 The question was natural
 ye bhi poocha jane laga ki modi ne bijepi kii chunavi mishan kii aupchaarik shuruuaat hi udhaar ke naare se kyon kii
 Is this a sign of his pro-american policy? The America which has always shied away from Modi, did not allow him to enter his borders, is Narendra Modi trying to please him
 sawaalon kii fehrist jab lambii hone lagi to modi ke pitare se in tamaam sawaalon kaa ek kaat uchhal aayaa
 Claimed that this slogan is pure desi, pure Gujarati
 tab kaa he jab obama america raajnneeti main shaayad apana vajood hi talash rahe honge
 In the year 2004, he released a video in which he was seen giving the slogan of Modi Gujarat Can and Gujarat Will
 is videon kii sachai par sawaal na uthe isliye modi ke bhaashan ke saath hi tab ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke bhaashan kaa ansh bhi jari kiya gaya
 Clearly, Modi who creates new jumlas every day, how would he have soaked up the charges of cheating in slogans
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki siyaasi maidan main modi kii ye safai kitni kargar rahati he

 kya aap bilkul hi panama papers se ujagar ho rahe karnaamon ko samaj nahin paa rahe hai? indian express akhbaar main pichley teen dinon se ek hi vishay par lambii-lambii kai report prakashit ho rahi hai
 It may also be that due to lack of time you are not able to give time to the Panama Papers
 duniya ke kai deshon ke akhbaaron main unke yahaan ke karnaamon ke bare main isi tarah report chap rahi hai
 The Panama Papers have been described as the biggest (leaks) disclosure ever
 haalanki kulasa sahi shabd nahin he kyonki khulaasa kaa matlab hota he zaraa sa bataanaa lekin hindi media ke chalan main kulasa thik ulte matlab ke liye istemaal hone laga he yani sab kuch bataa dena
 At times, such complex economic issues make one feel sad
 main khud apni ayogyata or akushalta ke kaaran aise tamaam vishyon main haath daalane se bachataa hum lekin is baar thodaa-thodaa karne, samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki maamla kya he
 Why a common reader should be interested in it and talk about it
 hamaare udyogpati nivesh ke naam par paise kaa kis tarah istamaal karte hai, kahaan se paisa laate hai or kis-kis ko madad karte hai, in sabaki hamen maamuli jaankaree bhi nahin hoti
 Everything happens within the closed walls of law and influence
 bhavavesh main aakar ham kai baar unhen yaa to chor kah dete hai yaa kai baar kuch kah paane kii sthiti main hi nahin hote
 In both cases, this sadness can prove to be dangerous for those who believe in considering themselves as aware citizens
 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne panama papers ke khulaase ke do din baad kaha he ki tex chori se bachane ke ye tareeke duniya bhar ke liye samasya hai
 Many of these accounts and companies are legal, but that is the problem
 aisa nahin he ki in logon ne kanoon tode hai balki samasya ye he ki aise kanoon hi kyon hai
 The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India has said that some accounts may also be valid but we will investigate
 bharat sarkaar ne bhi isaki jaanch ke liye kai agenciyon ko jimmaa saunpa he
 a judicial inquiry has also been announced in Pakistan
 norway se lekar austrailia tak main jaanch hone lagi he
 i think President Obama's statement goes beyond the limit of legal-illegal saying why such rules are made
 jahaan log kanoonee tareeke se kaagazi companiyaan banaate hai, unamem nideshak banate hai, kai baar aam logon se bhi share ke zariye paisa batorte hai, kai baar dallali se lekar hathiyaar saude kaa paisa lagaakar kaale dhan ko kanoonee kar dete hai
 More than two lakh companies whose names have appeared in Panama Papers
 wo companiyaan kanoonee tareeke se banaai gai hongi magar kya unamem lage paise bhi kanoonee rup se hi kamaaye gaye honge
 For this, it is important to understand the rules of forming a company and investment, but even if this information is not available, an angle can be easily understood
 panama papers ke ek karod se bhi adhik dastauez company ke chalis saal ke karnaamon ke hisaab hai
 This document is from the Mosaic Fonseca Company
 yah company duniya bhar ke tamaam raashtra pramukhon, netaaon, kaarobaariyon or mashhoor hastiyon ke paise kaa bandobast karne ke liye kaagazi companiyaan khulawaati he or unamem nivesh karwaati he
 Fonseca claims that she does this work legally
 phonseka apane graahakon ke bare main nahin jaanati kyonki ye graahak us tak mashhoor bainkon ke zariye pahunchate hai
 It has also been learned that the big banks and Fonseca play a game of huddle here and there
 graahak apana paisa lekar bank ke paas pahunchataa he or bank us paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye phonseka kii madad se company khulavaa dete hai
 There is evidence of this
 panama papers se pehle hi ye pahalu sabit ho chukaa he
 Now we will try to understand the moral and legal aspect of this case through a company named Mozak Fonseca
 ek baar jab aap phonseka ke graahakon kii verieti jaan lenge tab aapako pataa chalegaa ki aatank se ladane ke naam par or bijness badhaane ke naam par aapako kaise ullu banaaya ja rahaa he
 It may be true that Fonska helped many industrialists legally open companies where they could invest or keep their money
 ham or aap bhi tex bachaate hai lekin ham chipa kar nahin bachaate hai
 We buy life insurance for him or buy a house
 kya in udyopatiyon ko kanoon ne ijazat di he ki ve apana tex bachaane ke liye panama main company khol sakate hai? company kholi bhi to kya sabane apane-apane desh main unki jaankaree di? website par bataaya? apane shairdharakon ko bataaya? The Panama Papers reveal that a company called Mosaic Fonseca, which provided legal aid to such terrorists, helped to fund terrorist organizations, from drug mafia to bank robbers and even Dawood Ibrahim
 phonseka ek aisi dukaan he jahaan ek kanoon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi jane kaa daawa karata he, jahaan koi aatankwaadi sanghathan se judaa hua apana paisa lekar chalaa jaataa he, drug mafia bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Yet you are assuming so easily that nothing happened in this revelation
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar bekaar main hi saal bhar tak in lakhon pannon ko palatate rahe or apane-apane mulkon main chaanbin karte rahe
 War is going on in Syria
 is yuddh main kai desh shaamil hai or sabane syria par pratibandh lagaaye hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki raashtrapati asad ne apane nagarikon kii hatya karwaai he
 Now that the ban has been imposed, how can Fonseca help to open an anonymous company to supply oil and gas to Syria
 is syria sankat se khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa ubhaar hua he jisase duniya tang he
 Now when these countries nationalize so vigorously to fight against terror, how did they not know that there are some people who are supplying oil and gas to Syria by forming a company
 ye tel or gas kya ek aadmi ke sapane se syria ke raashtrapati ke sapane main transfar ho jate honge
 If you go, you will have to go through some way, nor does it appear
 rus ke raashtrapati ne bhi pichley saal aarope lagaaya tha ki aatanki sanghathan ke saath kai desh kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 This game is going on with terror
 or is khel main aam aadmi kahin hindu muslim ke angel se bhida hua he to kahin islamic aatank ke angel se
 Syria is not a single subsidiary but a network of many companies
 or to or inamen se teen companiyaan aisi hai jin par amareeki kanoon ke tahat pratibandh bhi laga hua he
 Mozak Fonseca has also worked for one of these companies
 america ke apane ricard kehete hai ki 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mozaaq phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 According to US documents, Mozak Fonseca has earned money by creating a paper company for financers suspected of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 hai na kamaal kaa khel ye
 If an industrialist or a lawyer can open a company and invest in England and Germany in the right way, do you or we assume that the only way to do business in these countries is to first go to Panama or British Virgin Islands to form a paper company, In these companies, keep directors whose poor people reside in Paharganj or Chal in Mumbai at the address given next to their name
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki phonseka ek sahi kaarobaari ke liye kaam karti he or aatankwaadi ke liye bhi
 There is nothing wrong in the fact that the company opens on paper and then closes, the money is poured out and removed and put elsewhere
 tippaniyan Wednesday's Indian Express reported that an outside company wanted a contract to print Indian currency
 company ne dilli main rahane vaale kisi vyakti ko sampark kiya ki aapako karodon denge
 This person got the contract and to give money to him, the company outside made a company for a Delhi-based gentleman
 company banaai phonseka ne or sajjan ji ko karodon rupee mil gaye
 Still no fuss
 ek naagarik ke taur par aisi udaseenta isliye thik nahin he ki netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Do you know exactly that the companies involved in this game will not help all types of parties financially, these industrialists or businessmen will not be the front of these leaders
 loktantr main jaagruk naagarik bananaa ek mushkil kaam he
 Preparing for iits also requires more study
 jalebi or samosa khaane ke kaam aane vaale akhbaaron ko padhane se koi phayda nahin
 You should see if there is any place for such journalism in those newspapers or you have ever seen such investigative journalism, which has hundreds of journalists from around the world
 yah sawaal pathak ke taur par aapako khud se karnaa he ki tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaren padhane ke liye aap maheene kaa teen sau-chaar sau rupaya kyon dete hai? ye akhbaar tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaron main maare gaye logon se insaaf bhi nahin karte
 Just make a mark in some corner, which we call as news in our tongue
 khaskar hindi ke akhbaaron main aapane khabaron ke prakaashan kii parampara dekhi he ? news channelon main aisi parampara dekhi he? nahin dekhi he to unase poocha kyon nahin he
 That is why you are also being exposed as a reader along with what is being exposed from the Panama Papers
 jise angrezi main expos hona kehete hai
 Are you a lazy and careless reader? apni berukhi se ye zaahir na karen ki mehnat se kii gai patrakarita ke kadradaan aap nahin hai
 If the readers do not appreciate, then the journalists will be heartbroken
 kai baar aise jatil aarthik vishyon ke prati udaasi samaj aati he
 i myself refrain from putting my hand in such subjects due to my ineptitude and inefficiency, but this time i tried to understand a little, what is the matter
 ek aam pathak ko kyon isamen dilchaspee leni chahie or iske bare main baat kerani chahie
 We do not even have the slightest knowledge of how our industrialists use money in the name of investment, where they bring money and who they help
 sab kuch kanoon or rasookh kii band deevaaron ke bheetar hota he
 Coming under the influence, we sometimes call them either thieves or sometimes they are not in a position to say anything
 donon hi maamle main khud ko jaagruk naagarik samajhane kaa bhram paalane waalon ke liye ye udaasi khataranaak sabit ho sakati he
 US President Barack Obama has said two days after the Panama Papers revelations that these ways of avoiding tax evasion are a problem for the world
 inamen se bahut se khate or companiyaan kanoonee hai magar samasya to yahi he
 It is not that these people have broken the law, but the problem is why there are such laws
 bhartiya reserve bank ke governor ne kaha he ki kuch khate vaid bhi ho sakate hai lekin ham jaanch karenge
 The Government of India has also tasked several agencies to investigate this
 pakistan main bhi isaki nyaayik jaanch kii ghoshnaa ho gai he
 Investigations have started from Norway to Australia
 mere khyaal se raashtrapati obama kaa bayaan vaid-avaidh kii seemaa se aage jaakar yah kah rahaa he ki aise niyam hi kyon bane hai
 Where people form paper companies in legal ways, they become directors, many times they also collect money from common people through shares, sometimes legalize black money by putting money from brokerage to arms deal
 panama papers main jin do lakh se adhik companiyon ke naam aae hai
 Those companies must have been formed in a legal manner, but should the money invested in them be made legally
 iske liye company banane or nivesh ke niyamon kii samaj zaruri he magar yah jaankaree na bhi ho to ek angel se maamle ko aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he
 The Panama Papers have more than 10 million documents according to the company's forty-year adventures
 yah dastauez hai mozaaq phonseka company ke
 The company opens and invests in paper companies to manage the money of heads of heads, leaders, businessmen and celebrities from all over the world
 phonseka kaa daawa he ki wo yah kaam kanoonee tareeke se karti he
 Fonseca does not know about his customers because these customers reach him through famous banks
 aisa bhi pataa chalaa he ki bade bank or phonseka milakar idhar-udhar kaa game khelte hai
 The customer reaches the bank with his money and the banks open the company with the help of Fonseca to find the money
 baqayda iske pramaan hai
 This aspect has already been proved by the Panama Papers
 ab ham prayaas karenge ki mozaaq phonseka naam kii company ke zariye is maamle ke naitik or kanoonee pahalu ko samajha jaae
 Once you know the variety of Fonseca's customers, then you will know how you are being made an owl in the name of fighting terror and in the name of increasing business
 yah sahi ho saktaa he ki phoneskaa ne kai udyogpatiyon ke liye kanoonee tareeke se companiyaan khulwaane main madad kii jahaan ve nivesh kar sake yaa apana paisa rakh sake
 We and you also save tax but we do not save by hiding
 ham uske liye jivan beemaa kharidte hai yaa makaan karidate hai
 Has the law allowed these entrepreneurs to open a company in Panama to save tax? Even if the company was opened, did everyone share their information in their respective countries? Told on the website? Told your shareholders? panama papers se pataa chalata he ki mozaaq phonseka naam kii kanoonee sahaayta pradaan karne vaali company ne aisi company aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii madad karne vaale, drug mafia se lekar bank luteron or yahaan tak ki daaud ibrahim ke paise ko thikaane lagane main madad kii
 Fonseca is a shop where even a law-abiding rich industrialist claims to go, where someone goes away with his money associated with a terrorist organization, and also goes to the drug mafia
 phir bhi aap itani aasaani se maan le rahe hai ki is khulaase main to kuch bhi nahin hua

 syria main yuddh chal rahaa he
 Many countries are involved in this war and all have imposed sanctions on Syria because they believe that President Assad has killed his citizens
 ab jab pratibandh lag gaya he to phir phonseka syria ko tel or gas supplai karne ke liye benami company khulwaane main kaise madad kar sakati he
 This Syria crisis has led to the emergence of dangerous terrorist organization ISIS, which is disturbing the world
 ab jab ye desh itani sanjidagi se aatank ke khilaaf ladane kaa rashtriya prasaaran karte hai to unhen ye baat kaise pataa nahin chali ki kuch log hai jo company banaakar syria ko tel or gas supplai kar rahe hai
 Will these oil and gas be transferred from a man's dream to the Syrian president's dream
 jate to kisi raste se hi honge na to kya wo bhi nahin dikhataa he
 The President of Russia also alleged last year that many countries are doing business with the terrorist organization
 ye khel chal rahaa he aatank ko lekar
 And in this game, the common man is confronted with the angle of Hindu Muslim and somewhere the angle of Islamic terror
 syria kii madadgaar koi ek company nahin he balki kai companiyon kaa network he
 Moreover, three of these companies are also banned under US law
 inhen main se ek company ke liye mozaaq phonseka ne kaam bhi kiya he
 America's own records state that Mozak Fonseca has worked with 334 people and companies
 amareeki dastavezon ke mutabik pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh sahukaaron ( financers) ke liye kaagazi company banaakar mozaaq phonseka ne paise kamaaye hai

 i think President Obama's statement goes beyond the limit of legal-illegal saying why such rules are made
 jahaan log kanoonee tareeke se kaagazi companiyaan banaate hai, unamem nideshak banate hai, kai baar aam logon se bhi share ke zariye paisa batorte hai, kai baar dallali se lekar hathiyaar saude kaa paisa lagaakar kaale dhan ko kanoonee kar dete hai
 More than two lakh companies whose names have appeared in Panama Papers
 wo companiyaan kanoonee tareeke se banaai gai hongi magar kya unamem lage paise bhi kanoonee rup se hi kamaaye gaye honge
 For this, it is important to understand the rules of forming a company and investment, but even if this information is not available, an angle can be easily understood
 panama papers ke ek karod se bhi adhik dastauez company ke chalis saal ke karnaamon ke hisaab hai
 This document is from the Mosaic Fonseca Company
 yah company duniya bhar ke tamaam raashtra pramukhon, netaaon, kaarobaariyon or mashhoor hastiyon ke paise kaa bandobast karne ke liye kaagazi companiyaan khulawaati he or unamem nivesh karwaati he
 Fonseca claims that she does this work legally
 phonseka apane graahakon ke bare main nahin jaanati kyonki ye graahak us tak mashhoor bainkon ke zariye pahunchate hai
 It has also been learned that the big banks and Fonseca play a game of huddle here and there
 graahak apana paisa lekar bank ke paas pahunchataa he or bank us paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye phonseka kii madad se company khulavaa dete hai
 There is evidence of this
 panama papers se pehle hi ye pahalu sabit ho chukaa he
 Now we will try to understand the moral and legal aspect of this case through a company named Mozak Fonseca
 ek baar jab aap phonseka ke graahakon kii verieti jaan lenge tab aapako pataa chalegaa ki aatank se ladane ke naam par or bijness badhaane ke naam par aapako kaise ullu banaaya ja rahaa he
 It may be true that Fonska helped many industrialists legally open companies where they could invest or keep their money
 ham or aap bhi tex bachaate hai lekin ham chipa kar nahin bachaate hai
 We buy life insurance for him or buy a house
 kya in udyopatiyon ko kanoon ne ijazat di he ki ve apana tex bachaane ke liye panama main company khol sakate hai? company kholi bhi to kya sabane apane-apane desh main unki jaankaree di? website par bataaya? apane shairdharakon ko bataaya? The Panama Papers reveal that a company called Mosaic Fonseca, which provided legal aid to such terrorists, helped to fund terrorist organizations, from drug mafia to bank robbers and even Dawood Ibrahim
 phonseka ek aisi dukaan he jahaan ek kanoon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi jane kaa daawa karata he, jahaan koi aatankwaadi sanghathan se judaa hua apana paisa lekar chalaa jaataa he, drug mafia bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Yet you are assuming so easily that nothing happened in this revelation
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar bekaar main hi saal bhar tak in lakhon pannon ko palatate rahe or apane-apane mulkon main chaanbin karte rahe
 War is going on in Syria
 is yuddh main kai desh shaamil hai or sabane syria par pratibandh lagaaye hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki raashtrapati asad ne apane nagarikon kii hatya karwaai he
 Now that the ban has been imposed, how can Fonseca help to open an anonymous company to supply oil and gas to Syria
 is syria sankat se khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa ubhaar hua he jisase duniya tang he
 Now when these countries nationalize so vigorously to fight against terror, how did they not know that there are some people who are supplying oil and gas to Syria by forming a company
 ye tel or gas kya ek aadmi ke sapane se syria ke raashtrapati ke sapane main transfar ho jate honge
 If you go, you will have to go through some way, nor does it appear
 rus ke raashtrapati ne bhi pichley saal aarope lagaaya tha ki aatanki sanghathan ke saath kai desh kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 This game is going on with terror
 or is khel main aam aadmi kahin hindu muslim ke angel se bhida hua he to kahin islamic aatank ke angel se
 Syria is not a single subsidiary but a network of many companies
 or to or inamen se teen companiyaan aisi hai jin par amareeki kanoon ke tahat pratibandh bhi laga hua he
 Mozak Fonseca has also worked for one of these companies
 america ke apane ricard kehete hai ki 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mozaaq phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 According to US documents, Mozak Fonseca has earned money by creating a paper company for financers suspected of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 hai na kamaal kaa khel ye
 If an industrialist or a lawyer can open a company and invest in England and Germany in the right way, do you or we assume that the only way to do business in these countries is to first go to Panama or British Virgin Islands to form a paper company, In these companies, keep directors whose poor people reside in Paharganj or Chal in Mumbai at the address given next to their name
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki phonseka ek sahi kaarobaari ke liye kaam karti he or aatankwaadi ke liye bhi
 There is nothing wrong in the fact that the company opens on paper and then closes, the money is poured out and removed and put elsewhere
 tippaniyan Wednesday's Indian Express reported that an outside company wanted a contract to print Indian currency
 company ne dilli main rahane vaale kisi vyakti ko sampark kiya ki aapako karodon denge
 This person got the contract and to give money to him, the company outside made a company for a Delhi-based gentleman
 company banaai phonseka ne or sajjan ji ko karodon rupee mil gaye
 Still no fuss
 ek naagarik ke taur par aisi udaseenta isliye thik nahin he ki netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Do you know exactly that the companies involved in this game will not help all types of parties financially, these industrialists or businessmen will not be the front of these leaders
 loktantr main jaagruk naagarik bananaa ek mushkil kaam he
 Preparing for iits also requires more study
 jalebi or samosa khaane ke kaam aane vaale akhbaaron ko padhane se koi phayda nahin
 You should see if there is any place for such journalism in those newspapers or you have ever seen such investigative journalism, which has hundreds of journalists from around the world
 yah sawaal pathak ke taur par aapako khud se karnaa he ki tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaren padhane ke liye aap maheene kaa teen sau-chaar sau rupaya kyon dete hai? ye akhbaar tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaron main maare gaye logon se insaaf bhi nahin karte
 Just make a mark in some corner, which we call as news in our tongue

 kya in udyopatiyon ko kanoon ne ijazat di he ki ve apana tex bachaane ke liye panama main company khol sakate hai? company kholi bhi to kya sabane apane-apane desh main unki jaankaree di? website par bataaya? apane shairdharakon ko bataaya? The Panama Papers reveal that a company called Mosaic Fonseca, which provided legal aid to such terrorists, helped to fund terrorist organizations, from drug mafia to bank robbers and even Dawood Ibrahim
 phonseka ek aisi dukaan he jahaan ek kanoon kaa paalan karne vaala amir udyogpati bhi jane kaa daawa karata he, jahaan koi aatankwaadi sanghathan se judaa hua apana paisa lekar chalaa jaataa he, drug mafia bhi chalaa jaataa he
 Yet you are assuming so easily that nothing happened in this revelation
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar bekaar main hi saal bhar tak in lakhon pannon ko palatate rahe or apane-apane mulkon main chaanbin karte rahe
 War is going on in Syria
 is yuddh main kai desh shaamil hai or sabane syria par pratibandh lagaaye hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki raashtrapati asad ne apane nagarikon kii hatya karwaai he
 Now that the ban has been imposed, how can Fonseca help to open an anonymous company to supply oil and gas to Syria
 is syria sankat se khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa ubhaar hua he jisase duniya tang he
 Now when these countries nationalize so vigorously to fight against terror, how did they not know that there are some people who are supplying oil and gas to Syria by forming a company
 ye tel or gas kya ek aadmi ke sapane se syria ke raashtrapati ke sapane main transfar ho jate honge
 If you go, you will have to go through some way, nor does it appear
 rus ke raashtrapati ne bhi pichley saal aarope lagaaya tha ki aatanki sanghathan ke saath kai desh kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 This game is going on with terror
 or is khel main aam aadmi kahin hindu muslim ke angel se bhida hua he to kahin islamic aatank ke angel se
 Syria is not a single subsidiary but a network of many companies
 or to or inamen se teen companiyaan aisi hai jin par amareeki kanoon ke tahat pratibandh bhi laga hua he
 Mozak Fonseca has also worked for one of these companies
 america ke apane ricard kehete hai ki 334 logon or companiyon ke saath mozaaq phonseka ne kaam kiya he
 According to US documents, Mozak Fonseca has earned money by creating a paper company for financers suspected of terrorists and war criminals operating in West Asia
 hai na kamaal kaa khel ye
 If an industrialist or a lawyer can open a company and invest in England and Germany in the right way, do you or we assume that the only way to do business in these countries is to first go to Panama or British Virgin Islands to form a paper company, In these companies, keep directors whose poor people reside in Paharganj or Chal in Mumbai at the address given next to their name
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki phonseka ek sahi kaarobaari ke liye kaam karti he or aatankwaadi ke liye bhi
 There is nothing wrong in the fact that the company opens on paper and then closes, the money is poured out and removed and put elsewhere
 tippaniyan Wednesday's Indian Express reported that an outside company wanted a contract to print Indian currency
 company ne dilli main rahane vaale kisi vyakti ko sampark kiya ki aapako karodon denge
 This person got the contract and to give money to him, the company outside made a company for a Delhi-based gentleman
 company banaai phonseka ne or sajjan ji ko karodon rupee mil gaye
 Still no fuss
 ek naagarik ke taur par aisi udaseenta isliye thik nahin he ki netaa kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Do you know exactly that the companies involved in this game will not help all types of parties financially, these industrialists or businessmen will not be the front of these leaders
 loktantr main jaagruk naagarik bananaa ek mushkil kaam he
 Preparing for iits also requires more study
 jalebi or samosa khaane ke kaam aane vaale akhbaaron ko padhane se koi phayda nahin
 You should see if there is any place for such journalism in those newspapers or you have ever seen such investigative journalism, which has hundreds of journalists from around the world
 yah sawaal pathak ke taur par aapako khud se karnaa he ki tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaren padhane ke liye aap maheene kaa teen sau-chaar sau rupaya kyon dete hai? ye akhbaar tractor trali ke takkar kii khabaron main maare gaye logon se insaaf bhi nahin karte
 Just make a mark in some corner, which we call as news in our tongue
 khaskar hindi ke akhbaaron main aapane khabaron ke prakaashan kii parampara dekhi he ? news channelon main aisi parampara dekhi he? nahin dekhi he to unase poocha kyon nahin he
 That is why you are also being exposed as a reader along with what is being exposed from the Panama Papers
 jise angrezi main expos hona kehete hai
 Are you a lazy and careless reader? apni berukhi se ye zaahir na karen ki mehnat se kii gai patrakarita ke kadradaan aap nahin hai
 If the readers do not appreciate, then the journalists will be heartbroken
 panama papers se pataa chalata he ki mozaaq phonseka naam kii kanoonee sahaayta pradaan karne vaali company ne aisi company aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii madad karne vaale, drug mafia se lekar bank luteron or yahaan tak ki daaud ibrahim ke paise ko thikaane lagane main madad kii
 Fonseca is a shop where even a law-abiding rich industrialist claims to go, where someone goes away with his money associated with a terrorist organization, and also goes to the drug mafia
 phir bhi aap itani aasaani se maan le rahe hai ki is khulaase main to kuch bhi nahin hua
 370 journalists from all over the world unnecessarily turned these millions of pages around for a year and searched their respective countries
 syria main yuddh chal rahaa he
 Many countries are involved in this war and all have imposed sanctions on Syria because they believe that President Assad has killed his citizens
 ab jab pratibandh lag gaya he to phir phonseka syria ko tel or gas supplai karne ke liye benami company khulwaane main kaise madad kar sakati he
 This Syria crisis has led to the emergence of dangerous terrorist organization ISIS, which is disturbing the world
 ab jab ye desh itani sanjidagi se aatank ke khilaaf ladane kaa rashtriya prasaaran karte hai to unhen ye baat kaise pataa nahin chali ki kuch log hai jo company banaakar syria ko tel or gas supplai kar rahe hai
 Will these oil and gas be transferred from a man's dream to the Syrian president's dream
 jate to kisi raste se hi honge na to kya wo bhi nahin dikhataa he
 The President of Russia also alleged last year that many countries are doing business with the terrorist organization
 ye khel chal rahaa he aatank ko lekar
 And in this game, the common man is confronted with the angle of Hindu Muslim and somewhere the angle of Islamic terror
 syria kii madadgaar koi ek company nahin he balki kai companiyon kaa network he
 Moreover, three of these companies are also banned under US law
 inhen main se ek company ke liye mozaaq phonseka ne kaam bhi kiya he
 America's own records state that Mozak Fonseca has worked with 334 people and companies
 amareeki dastavezon ke mutabik pashchim asia main sakriy aatankwaadiyon or yuddh aparaadhiyon ke sandigdh sahukaaron ( financers) ke liye kaagazi company banaakar mozaaq phonseka ne paise kamaaye hai
 This is not an amazing game
 agar koi udyogpati yaa vakil sahi tareeke se company kholkar england or germany main nivesh kar saktaa he to kya aap yaa ham ye maan len ki in deshon main bijness karne kaa ekmaatr rasta yahi he ki aap pehle panama yaa british varjin island jaakar kaagazi company banaaen, in companiyon main aise nideshak rakhen jinke naam ke aage die gaye pate par pahadganj yaa mumbai ke chaal main rahane vaale garib log rahete hon
 How can it be that Fonseca works for a rightful businessman and also for a terrorist
 kaagaz par company khule or phir band ho jaae, paisa daalaa jaae or nikaal kar kahin or laga diya jaae isamen kuch galat hi nahin he
 The comments buudhvaar ke indian express main khabar chhapi he ki baahar kii ek company ko bhartiya note chhapane kaa theka chahie
 The company contacted someone living in Delhi that would give you crores
 is vyakti ne theke dilava diye or use paise dene ke liye baahar vaali company ne dilli vaale sajjan ke liye ek company banavaa di
 Fonseca formed the company and Sajjan ji got crores of rupees
 phir bhi hangaamaa nahin
 Such apathy as a citizen is not correct because the name of the leader did not come up
 kya aap thik thik jaanate hai ki is khel main shaamil companiyaan sabhi prakaar ke dalon kii aarthik madad nahin karti hongi, ye udyogpati yaa kaarobaari in netaaon ke front nahin honge
 Becoming aware citizens is a difficult task in a democracy
 iaiti ke liye taiyaari karne se bhi zyaada adhyayan kii zarurat padati he
 There is no use in reading newspapers that are useful for eating jalebi and samosa
 aapako dekhnaa chahie ki un akhbaaron main aisi patrakarita ke liye koi jagah bhi he yaa kabhi aapane is tarah kii khoji patrakarita dekhi bhi he, jisamen duniya bhar ke saikadon patrkaar din-raat lage hon
 As a reader, you have to ask yourself why do you pay three hundred and four hundred rupees a month to read the news of tractor trolley collision? These newspapers also do not judge the people killed in the news of tractor trolley collision
 bas kisi kone main chhap dete hai jinhen ham apni jubaan main khabar lagaana kehete hai
 Especially in Hindi newspapers have you seen the tradition of publishing news? Have you seen such a tradition in news channels? If you have not seen it, why have you not asked them? isiilie panama papers se jo ujagar ho rahaa he uske saath-saath ek pathak ke taur par bhi aap bhi ujagar ho rahe hai
 Which is called expose in English
 kahin aap ek aalsee or laaparvaah pathak to nahin hai
 Do not make it clear that you are not appreciative of hard-earned journalism
 pathak kadra nahin karenge to patrakaron kaa dil tut jayega

 Samajwadi Party leader and Uttar Pradesh PWD and Irrigation Minister Shivpal Yadav has indicated the return of Amar Singh and Jaya Prada to the party
 yadav ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party ke daravaaje kabhi kisi ke liye band nahin hote
 Not only this, Shivpal Yadav even went so far as to say that Mulayam Singh and his talks with Amar Singh are frequent and Amar Singh will enter the party whenever he wants
 pichley saal bhi thi sugabugahtadrasal peedbludi mantri amar singh par media kii un khabaron kaa khandan kar rahe the jinamein pehle rajya sabha or ab vidhaan parishad main siton ko lekanmar sinhakaa tikat cat jane kii baat kahi thi
 Earlier, Amar Singh's return to the party was on the occasion of Janeshwar Mishra Jayanti in August 2014 when he shared the stage with Mulayam Singh
 netaji se paariwarik sambandhye baat alag he ki sapa ke kaddavar mantri or amar singh ke dhur virdohi ajam khan ne in khabaron kaa lagaataar khandan kiya lekin pichley dinon mantri shivpal yadav ne ye kah kar amar singh kii vaapasi kii khabar ko hawa di thi ki party main lautne kaa faisla amar par hi choda gaya he
 This latest statement by Shivpal has once again created a panic in the Thakur camp of the Samajwadi Party as most of the leaders think that the return of Amar Singh will change the equation within the party again and its biggest impact is that the politics of Thakurs in caste equations Will fall on the leaders
 vaapasi kaa faisla amar singh parashivpal yadav ne kaha, 'amar singh se hamaare paariwarik sambandh hai
 There is a good relationship with Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) as well
 achche sambandh hai lekin wo party main nahin hai
 Earlier too, you had asked when Amar Singh is joining the party, even then i had said that Amar Singh will declare himself
 to unhone abhi tak to dikalair nahin kiya he
 So when he was not in the party and did not even ask for a ticket, then there is no question of being cut
 par phir bhi akhabaaron main chhap diya
 If they had asked then it was a matter because we have family relations, good relations even if we are not in the party, still there are good relations
 ham to kal bhi dilli main mili
 Amar and Jaya held Ajit Singh's ouster from Rajya Sabha MP Amar Singh as well as Jaya Pradako after a dispute with Damanmulayam Singh
 jaya pradaa sapa ke tikat par do baar rampur se saansad rah chuki hai
 Jaya Prada and Amar Singh, who were in the Samajwadi Party, joined the National Lok Dal of Ajit Singh on 10 March 2014
 loksabhaa chunaav (general Election 2019) main ab kuch maheene bache hai
 The ruling bjp-led NDA at the Center is busy trying to make a comeback, but now it is becoming difficult for the BJP to handle the NDA (national Democratic Alliance) on the threshold of elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan bijepi ne 282 siten hasil kii thim, to vahiin endie ke sahyogiyon ne 54 siton par kabja jamaaya
 The figure thus reached 335, but the NDA is no longer the same as it was in 2014, after the bjp's defeat in the by-elections and the dropping of allies one by one
 chandrababu naidu or upendra kushvaha jaise kaddavar netaaon kaa saath chhootane ke baad ab shivasena, akali dal or apana dal jaisi partiyaan endie se alag hone kii dhamkee de rahi hai
 That is, there is a lump in the alliance
 agar bijepi is gathbandhan kii ganth kholane main naakaam rahi to 2019 kii tasviir kuch or hogi
 The Shiv Sena, one of the important allies of the NDA, has been consistently eyeing the BJP
 yahaan tak ki pichley dinon khud bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii, lekin shivasena kaa ravaiya jas kaa tas yani aankh dikhaane vaala hi rahaa
 Two days earlier, Shiv Sena threatened to break away from the NDA
 shivasena ne kaha,'vah pehle bhi akele chali thi or aage bhi chal sakati he'
 That is, everything is not right
 kaha ja rahaa he ki shivasena maharashtra main bijepi ke baraabar siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he or dabaav kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 There is also a discussion that the BJP can enter the election summer under the 'bihar formula' in Maharashtra, considering the demand of Shiv Sena
 2014 main jab bijepi kii sarkaar bani to sansad ke centralhol main yojit baithak main piem modi ke thik bagal main baithne waalon main akali dal ke netaprakash singh badal bhi the
 The height of the cloud can be estimated from this
 lekin 2014 ke baad chijen badal gai hai
 Now the Akali Dal is also turning its eyes
 haal hi main akali dal ne gurudwara maamle main dakhsandaji ko lekar bijepi ko ultimatum de diyaor kaha ki bijepi ne agar takht, gurudwara maamle main dakhlandaji band nahin kii to gathbandhan hamaare liye myne nahin rakhega
 We will play brick by brick of BJP government
 yani bijepi ke liye dagar mushkil he
 Apart from the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal, Om Prakash Rajbhar's Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, Conrad Sangma's National People's Party and Anupriya Patel's Apna Dal, which have a good hold in their respective areas, have constantly threatened to break away from the NDA
 anupriya patel or rajbhar kii tamaam muddon par jahaan bijepi se judarah rahi he, to vahiin purvottar main ji-jaan se juty bijepi comeghalaya ke mukhyamantri or neshnal pipuls party ke adhyakshaconrad sangama (meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma) ne lagbhag dhamkee de daali
 He said that his party was waiting for an 'appropriate time' to break ties with the NDA government (NDA Govt)

 The CPI (M) demanded that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should take responsibility for all scams on his government, including 2G and KG basin issues, but the party has not sought his resignation

 He said that the Left Front was of the opinion that the Prime Minister should be brought under the purview of Lokpal
 unhone kaha ki is baat kaa koi auchity nahin he ki pradhanmantri ko sevanivritti ke baad hi lokapal ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 Karat said that every day a new scam is coming out whether it is 2G, KG or CWG

 haal hi main unhone polio se desh ko bachaane ke liye chalaae gaye abhiyaan ke sakaaratmak asar par baat kii
 Amitabh wrote in one of his articles that till some time ago, it seemed like a fantasy to liberate the country from polio

 dilli sarkaar se lekar centre sarkaar ke saamne lagaataar virodh pradarshan ke jariyesafai karmchaarisanghathan aawaaj uthaa rahe hai lekin samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii bajaay puure maamle main sirf raajnneeti ho rahi he
 This is the reason why the Safai Karamcharis Union again staged protests in two different places on Tuesday
 shuruyaat main pradarshnkaree purvidellike vishwaas nagar ke samudaay bhawan pahunche
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday was being celebrated by setting up a health checkup camp here
 jisamen kendriya swasthya mantri jepi nadda ke pahunchane se pehle hi safai karmchaariyon ne samudaay bhawan ke mukhya maarg ko gher liya
 All the scavengers reached the main gate of the community building while pushing around with the Delhi Police
 pradarshan ke dauraan safai karmchaaree purvi dilli nagar nigam ke karmchaariyon ko bakaayaa fund dene or unhen pakkaa karne kii maang karte rahe
 However, after hard work before Union Minister JP Nadda arrived, the Delhi Police was able to remove the cleaning staff from the front of the community building
 mantri rajendra paal gautam ke khilaaf narebaajiiske baad safai karmchaariyon ne purvi dilli ke tahitpur ilaake main kai kilometre march karte hue virodh jataayaa he
 In Delhi government, sloganeering slogans against Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam and burnt the effigy of the minister
 pradarshan kii vajah se mukhya sadak par kaaphi der tak lanbaa jam bhi laga rahaa
 a large number of male and female cleaning workers participated in the demonstration
 aap netaa kaa aarope- emsidi main ghotaalon ne barbaad kiyapure maamle main sawaal poochne paraam aadmi partike purvi dilli se nagar nigam main netaa vipaksh kuldeep kumaar nebijepiper hamalaa bol diya
 Kuldeep Kumar said that due to the strike in East Delhi, there is bad condition
 emsidi main kai ghotaalon ne use barbaadi kii kagaar par pahunchaa diya he
 Scam is done with the salary of the cleaning workers
 pichley 11 saalon main bijepi safai karmchaariyon ko selary dene main naakaam rahi he
 In the last 4 years, the Congress government would not have given as much funds to the Aam Aadmi Party government
 aaj emsidi kaa ek rupaya dilli sarkaar ke upar bakaayaa nahin he jabaki dilli sarkaar ke emsidi par 6 hajaar karod rupee udhaar hai
 BJP seduces the public: Aam Admi Party spokesperson and Lok Sabha in-charge from north-east Delhi, Dilip Pandey said that MCD commissioners go to court and give information about receiving funds by giving written affidavit
 bijepi ke log safai karmchaariyon ko bahakaate hai or apane bhrashtachar kaa thikra dusron par phodte hai
 The public is facing problems due to lack of cleanliness, BJP is not deterred by playing with the health of common people
 'safai karmchaaree pichley kai dinon se hadtaal par hai or virodh pradarshan ke jariye dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ke saamne maang rakh rahe hai
 But before the festival, the strike and protest of the cleaning workers in Delhi raises many big questions about how much funds the Delhi government is giving to the corporation
 iske alaava nigam karmchaariyon ko kitni selary de rahaa he
 Akshay Kumar made a comeback on the small screen with Star Plus' comedy reality show 'the Great Indian Laughter Challenge'
 is sho kaa aagaaj bahut hi garmjoshi se hua tha
 But in the TRP race, Kumar failed to keep the show at the top
 ab khabar ai he ki kam TRP ke chalate sho ke jaj mallika dua, jakir khan or hossain dalal ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya gaya he
 Instead of these three judges, two new well-known faces will be seen in the show
 bollywood ke phani diarector sajid khan or golmaal ke actor shreyas talapade kii sho main entry hogi
 According to the news, the first episode with Sajid and Shreyas will be shot on 18 October
 beti se shev karavaate hue akshay ne share kiya VIDEO, beti ke berthde par bole-tum badi mat honise sho ko shuruuaat se hi kam TRP kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Unhappy makers decided to change things
 mallika, jakir or hossain internet senceshan hai lekin unki popularity se sho ko zyada phayda nahin hua
 So the makers decided to take on popular faces
 mallika dua or jakir khan digital platform par kamedi kii duniya main bada naam hai
 For this reason, both of them were brought on the show with Akshay
 mallika dua bindaas kii web siries- da trip main lisa heden ke saath najar ai thim
 He also did a funny video with AIB
 jakir bhi standap kamedian kii duniya kaa janaa-maan cheharaa hai
 He has also appeared in the AIB video
 saf bole- main akshay kumaar bananaa chahta hum, bataai ye vajamb dekhne vaali baat yah he ki sajid khan or shreyas talapade kijugalbandisho ko kis aayam tak lekar jaati he
 How much do these two new mentors benefit Akshay Kumar's show in the TRP race
 intervyuu ke dauraan aksar aisa hota he ki ham aasaan sawaalon jawaab dete samay kuch maamuli galtiyaan kar baithte he, jiske vajah se ek acchhee naukari haath se chali jaati he
 If you are looking for a new job and are going to interview, then avoid giving such answers
 
 
 jaane intervyuu ke dauraan kaisaa ho aapkaa jawaab
 
 
 Tell something about yourself Usually in the interview, the first question that is asked is to tell something about yourself
 iske liye kuch taiyaari kar len
 It should not be that you are repeating things
 koshish karen ki jo kaam aap jaanate hai usee ke bare main bataaen
 Keep in mind that you should focus more on those things and work, for which position (work) you have gone to take a job
 pehle se kiye kaamon ko bataate hue vartmaan main jo kaam aap kar rahe hai unhen bataate hue baat khatm karen
 Do not exaggerate yourself
 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko coolpichhali naukari kyon chodi?aise prashnon kaa sakaaratmak jawaab den
 If there is any problem in that job, do not mention it at all
 jo bhi bataaen use hansmukh hokar bataaen or sakaaratmak mode par laakar baat khatm karen
 It did not even say by mistake that the previous office environment was not good, holidays were not available, work pressure was high
 kitne saal kaam kaa anubhavjis pad ke liye aap intervyuu dene ja rahe hai usase sambandhit puraane anubhavon ke bare main bataaen
 If there is no experience related to the post, mention the works related to it
 apane aap ko zyada ekperions dikhaane ke liye apana kaamon kaa gun gane kii jarurat nahin he
 Doing so can create a negative impression
 kitne bhi ho skild, offis ke pehle din bhuulakar bhi naa karen ye galtiyanhamaare santhaan ke bare main kya jaanate hai?intervyuu se ek din pehle company ke bare main research karke jaaen
 Like what kind of work does the company (institute) you want to go to, who are its competitors in the market, what is the attitude of the institute in the market
 santhaan ko or aage le jane main aap kis tarah kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 What are those things that you know whose experience can make the company better
 kyon judana chaahate hai?ye ek ahm sawaal he
 Answer this question thoughtfully in view of the information collected about the company
 jawaab main sachai hona jaruri he, nahin to aapaki juthi baat yahaan turant pakad main aa jaaegi
 Want to change jobs, or increase income
 aisa jawaab dekar apane pair par kulhadi maarane kii koshish naa karen
 Present it in such a way that you may have come to join this institute for a long time
 iskaa sawaal kaa jawaab ekadam sateek or sakaaratmak den
 Your work-related interviewer won't want to hear a long answer
 kya aap nishchit taur par yahi naukari paanaa chaahate hai? agar haa
 So the better answer for such questions is that i will do better work for the institute as much as possible
 main yahaan ritred hone tak kaam karnaa chaahunga, basharte ki company ko meri jarurat ho
 Why should the institute take you? You tell them that the work that you need is needed in the institute and you can share your experience with the institute and take the institute to the path of success
 jab aap anubhav kii baat karen to kisi duusare aavedak se tulana naa karen
 If possible, the ideas that advance the institute can be kept
 aapkaa sabase majboot paksh kya he?jawaab kai ho sakate hai lekin sakaaratmak jawaab hi den
 Your ability to work, skill to overcome problems, ability to work under pressure, professional experience, leadership skills and positive attitude
 kitni selary kii ummidayah prashn poocha hi jaataa he
 It has to be answered very cleverly
 isliye pehle iskaa jawaab naa den or kahen ki haalanki yah bahut mushkil jawaab he, acha hoga aap mujhe kitna dene ke icchhuk hai
 In many cases, the interviewer says that he will tell you later
 aise main kahen- thik he, kaam ko dekhte hue mujhe thik selary kii ummid he
 Sex and cds have become the headlines of the politics of Rajasthan
 bhavari devi or paras kaa maamla abhi thama bhi nahin ki ek or sidi ne rajasthan kii raajnneeti ko garma diya
 Although this time the BJP leaders are standing on the edge of the CD, but from Bhanwari till now, Rajasthan's b film is seen
 khud ko bijepi kaa netaa bataane vaale ek jaalim pati ne apni hi patni ko netaaon or police afasaron ke saamne parosa
 Then he made 43 cds, not one or two, and started blackmailing him
 usee peedit mahila ne adaalat main guhaar lagaayi ki kaise purv saansad, purv mantri or bijepi ke duusare netaaon ne baar-baar uski asmat ko ronda
 The biggest personality in Rajasthan's sex CD Part Two, who has pointed fingers, is former BJP MP Nihalchand Meghwal
 nihalchand sriganganagar se do baar bijepi ke saansad rah chuke hai or ek baar wo risingh nagar se bijepi ke vidhayak
 Jogeshwar Garg, who was the Ayurved Minister in the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government of Rajasthan, has also accused this woman of having a relationship with him
 jalor se do baar bijepi ke tikat par garg vidhayak rah chuke hai
 The sex CD Part Two that put Rajasthan's opposition politics on the backfoot is Omprakash Godara, the husband of the victim herself
 rajasthan uniwarsity chaatrasangh ke purv adhyaksh or bijepi ke chaatr netaa pushpendra bharadwaj or bijepi ke kai bade netaaon ke nijee sahaayak rahe vivekanand bhi shaamil hai
 Apart from these, Rajasthan Police DSP Anil Rao and Inspector Mahaveer are also named
 peedit mahila kaa aarope he ki ghar main camere lage the or vahi uski ek do nahin, balki sex kii 43 sidi khud uske pati ne banwaaya
 The story of the woman whose victim has caused a stir in Rajasthan's politics is very painful
 uske maathe main suhaag kaa sindur saje ek maheenaa bhi nahin hua tha ki uske pati ne use behosh karke deh-vyapaar ke daldal main daal diya
 The woman alleged that she was kept in a closed room so that her voice could not come out
 bevafaayee or rusavaai ke parade main subakati is mahila kii aansuon ne rajasthan kii raajnneeti main aag laga di he lekin is bebas mahila kii khushiyon main aag lagaayi khud iske pati ne
 The woman, who hails from Sirsa in Haryana, alleges that her husband has become a dealer in its own right
 is peedit mahila kii shaadi pichley saal disambar main rajasthan ke property dealer om prakaash godara se hui thi
 After getting a good family and family, it got happiness from Sato Jah
 lekin ise kya pataa tha ki jis shaks ne iskaa haath pakadaa he, vahi ise deh vyapaar kii daldal main dhakel degaa
 Godara started serving his political masters soon after marrying his wife
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jab is mahila ne apane pati kaa krur cheharaa dekh liya to phir maheenon tak maun kyon rahi
 This woman says that she used to threaten to kill me
 saath hi phone yaa mobile to chune tak nahin detaa tha
 The woman claims that one day she escaped from the clutches of her husband
 tab iske pati ne iske chachaa par hanumangarh main apharan kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa
 After this, the woman also filed a case of rape and prostitution on her husband in Dabwali, Sirsa
 baad main 6 november ko usne jaipur main 18 logon ke khilaaf balaatkaar kii shikaayat police ko di, jisaki police jaanch kar rahi he
 The husband of this woman is absconding while other accused have also gone against the woman in court
 adaalat ne jaipur police ko kaha he ki sabhi aropiyon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya jaae
 But this woman's accusations have further enlivened the fun in the politics of Rajasthan
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne 2017 ke aakhri din kaha ki bihar ab laalaten mukt hoga
 Now every village in Bihar will have electricity in every hamlet and every habitation
 lekin kyonki laalaten argedy kaa chunaav chihn he isliye is bayaan ko rajnatik chashme se bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 After listening to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mind at the BJP office in Patna, Sushil Kumar Modi said that this time the Prime Minister has paid attention to the youth in Mann Ki Baat
 21veen sadi ke bachche is saal balig ho jaaenge
 That is, children born in 2000 will be 18 this year and they will also become voters
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne 2016 main hi elaan kiya tha ki 2018 ke disambar tak bihar ke sabhi gharon main bijli pahunch jaaegi
 According to the target so far, electricity will reach almost all the villages of Bihar and it is believed that all the houses will have electricity before June 2018
 is tarah se roshni ke maamle main bihar ek tarah se laalaten mukt hoga
 However, politically, the biggest challenge for the NDA in 2018 is the RJD
 2017 bihar kii raajnneeti ke liye naatakeey saal rahaa
 The NDA has only time for 2018 to intervene
 kyonki argedy ne jis tareeke se nitish kumaar or bijepi ko nishane par liya chaahe wo satta ke parivartan kaa maamla ho yaa phir argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale main sajaa hone kaa
 RJD is taking both the cases loudly among the public
 aise main endie ke liye janata ke saamne apni baat joardaar tareeke se rakhni hogi or wo keval bhaashan se nahi balki vikaas ke kaam se hi sambhav dikhataa he
 In 2018, the NDA can get the support of the public only and only because of its work because Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and Bihar assembly elections in 2020 are coming, so 2018 is the only year in which work can be done
 modi ne kaha ki bihar is varsh andhkaar se mukt hoga lekin keval bijli kii roshni se hi andhkaar nahi mit sakegaa
 The future of the youth will also have to be taken care of, providing employment opportunities so that their future is not bleak
 saath hi kisaanon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue bhashtrachaar ke andhkaar ko bhi mitaanaa hoga
 Sushil Modi has appealed to the youth to register their names in the voter list
 He also said that the BJP will organize programs for the youth at various places so that the dream of youth can be made in Bihar
 mumbai par 26 november ko hue aatanki hamale ke silsile main spain main 8 sandigdh logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 All these people worked for Lashkar
 in8 logon main se7 pakistani naagarik or ek uttar africa naagarik shaamil hai
 The arrest of Purushottam Naresh Dwivedi, MLA from Banda district on the alleged rape last week, clearly shows a warning wall for Chief Minister Mayawati
 vah yah he ki unke liye unki party basapa ke vidhayak or mantri hi sabase bada boj sabit hone ja rahe hai
 If Mayawati does not understand this warning due to approaching the assembly elections due in 2012, the next phase may prove to be difficult for her
 mukhyamantri abhi tak duusari partiyon ke aadha darjan logon ke alaava apni hi party basapa ke chaar mantriyon, do vidhayakon or ek saansad ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle darj karvaa chuki hai
 Not only this, if the Chief Minister does not stop the police from behaving like BSP workers, then his inhuman attitude and biased attitude towards the criminals will only add to their problems
 banda ke tazatreen maamle main police ne pehle shikayatakarta ladki-avyask shilu-ko hi jail main daal diya tha
 It is said that he was allegedly raped by the MLA and his three operatives 
 aisa shaayad uttar pradesh main hi ho saktaa he, jahaan koi fariyadi to salaakhon ke peeche band ho or apradhi satta ke galiyaaron main ghumta najar aae
 Not only this, Superintendent of Police of Banda District A
 ke
 Das himself went inside the jail and threatened Shilu to keep his mouth shut, otherwise he would have to bear the consequences
 jail kaa arth hota he nyaayik hiraasat, jahaan adaalat kii anumati ke bina police aaropee yaa abhiyukt se nahin mil sakati
 But in this case, the Superintendent of Police also crossed constitutional limits to please the legislators and political masters
 bataate hai ki achchhelal naamak ek basapa kaaryakarta ne banda jile main narayani ke basapa vidhayak dvivedi se kaha tha ki vah 17 saal kii uski beti shilu ko apane ghar main naukaraani ke taur par rakh len, kyonki kuch sthaneey gunde use pareshaan karte rahete hai
 On 11 December, Sheelu was released at Dwivedi's house and he was allegedly gang-raped the very next day
 jahiraa taur par uskaa munh band karne ke liye 13 disambar ko vidhayak ke putr mayank ne ek exiar darj karwaai ki shilu unke awaas se ek mobile, kapade or kuch nakadi lekar faraar ho gai he
 At the behest of the MLA, the police arrested the victim girl and took Rs 5,000 from her possession
 nakad, ek mobile or kuch kapade baraamad karke 14 disambar ko use jail main pahunchaa diya
 The next day, when Shilu's father and brother Santu were roaring in the throats of the criminal act of the girl, the local police threatened them both
 balaatkaar kaa maamla dabaane kii police kii koshishen naakaam raheen to isliye ki basapa vidhayak or unke gundon ke khilaaf balaatkaar ke aarope samooche bundelkhand main gunjane lage
 The famous Pink Gang started holding demonstrations and protest meetings on this issue
 sanpat naamak khyath mahila kaaryakarta kii aguai main gulabi gang aisi mahilaon kaa samooh he, jo gulabi rang kii sari pahenti hai or mahilaon ke prati kiye gaye aparaadhon kaa virodh karti hai
 Finally, in the case of Lucknow, which became the center of people's eyes, the opposition in the capital Lucknow also started besieging the Mayawati government
 natijatan, mayawati sarkaar ko sibi-siidi dwaara nae sire se jaanch kaa nirdesh dena padaa
 Anyway, the opposition was looking for an issue against the Mayawati government
 arase se mukhyamantri ke khilaaf ladati aa raheen pradesh congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna-joshi ne kaha, ''jab tak vidhayak ko sajaa nahin milti, main khamosh nahin baithungi
 Mayawati took action only when she found herself surrounded by the Congress and the media on the Sheelu episode
 '' shilu banda jail main thi to bahuguna-joshi usase milane gai thim, par jail prashasan ne unhen anumati nahin di
 Local Congress MLA Vivek Singh met Sheelu in jail and took up the matter at the local level
 bhaajapa kii smriti irani bhi shilu or unke parivarijanon se milane banda gayi
 The sp's main opposition party was a golden opportunity for the political exploitation of the Sheelu scandal, but it could not do so

 But after the CID report was submitted, Mayawati tried to calm the case by not expressing any sympathy to the accused MLA
 phir bhi kuch prashn anuttarit hai
 Why was Shilu of a backward caste called Nishad a Dalit? The girl, who skipped school, is an adult according to school records and has accused her father of 'keeping a bad eye'
 shilu kii gumshudagi kii ek report madhya pradesh ke panna jile main harnampur thane main likhavai gai thi
 When the Madhya Pradesh Police recorded her statement on December 15 in that case, why did she not mention rape by the MLA even once? Sheelu had left the mla's residence on December 12, but was arrested on December 14
 bich main vah kahaan rahi? ek pita ne kyon or kin halaat main apni beti ko vidhayak ke ghar par rakhaa? jail main 18 disambar tak shilu ke likhit bayanon main vidhayak dwaara balaatkaar kaa ullekh kyon nahin he? kya banda ke ek taqatvar basapa netaa ke daure se yah kahani puri tarah badal gai?baharhaal, jis tarah se shilu prakaran ko samarthan mila usase rajya main amarmani treepathi-madhumita shukla cond kii yaad taaja ho gai he, jo 2003 main mayawati ke raaj main hi hua tha
 Tripathi was then a minister in the then Mayawati government and Madhumita was murdered after sexually assaulting her for months
 mukhyamantri ne maamle kii siidi jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha, lekin jab vibhaag ne karrwai kii to do police afasaron ko treepathi par ungali uthaane ke aarope main nilambit kar diya gaya
 In the Shilu case, it was expected that the Mayawati government would try to suppress it
 siidi team ne jab vidhayak or unke teen sahyogiyon suresh netaa, rajendra shukla or ravan garg ko daboch liya to treepathi cond ke vipareet mayawati ne turant karrwai karke yah spasht kar diya ki ve doshiyon ko nahin bakhshengi
 On 12 January, Cabinet Secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh announced at a press conference that the Chief Minister has decided to take immediate action on the report of the CID that convicted the BSP MLA and his goons in the rape case and criminal cases against them
 Are being recorded agle din narayani police ne maamla darj kar lakhanu se laut rahe vidhayak ko pakadakar jail pahunchaa diya
 Mayawati was so terrorized by the ghost of the Sheelu rape scandal that while speaking at her birthday celebrations she raised the issue herself and said that the theft charges against Sheelu seem to be fake, so she should be released
 udhar, jail bheje gaye vidhayak kii patni aashaa dvivedi ne 20 janvari ko lakhanu main ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unke pati ko nyaay nahin mila to ve puure parivaar ke saath apni jivan lila samaapt kar lengi
 With son Mayank, he said clearly, "my husband is innocent and impotent
" '' unke mutabik vidhayak ko rajnatik shadyantr kaa shikaar banaaya gaya he, par is sambandh main unhone kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 He said, "after God, we have faith in Sister Mayawati
 ''siidi report par mayawati kii turant karrwai, shilu kii jail se rihaai or doshi chaar police adhikariyon or ek jail adhikari kaa nilamban bhi is mudde par unki sarkaar ke khilaaf gusse ko thanda karne main naakaam rahaa or yah mudda banda jaise doordaraj ke ilaake se uthakar desh kii sarvocch adaalat tak ja pahunchaa, jahaan nami vakil harish salve ne maamle kii nyaayik jaanch karaane kii vakaalat kii
 But the Chief Minister has requested to hear the case in a fast track court
 jaahir he, samay bitne ke saath mayawati ke vidhayak or mantri unke liye boj sabit hote ja rahe hai, or vipaksh ke haath main hukumat par hamalaa karne kaa aujaar ban rahe hai
 Dwivedi's former mlas like Shekhar Tiwari and Guddu Pandit had to go to jail and Rajesh Tripathi had to face dismissal like three other ministers because of his disputed antics
 par mayawati isse koi sabak lene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Merely saving an MLA or a minister pushes his image across the state
 duusare mukhyamantri ko eemaandaaree se police ko yah chetavanee deni chahie ki vah sattarudh dal kii agent ke rup main kaam karne ke bajaae vastugat aadhaar par kaam kare
 This happens every time in Uttar Pradesh that the police follow the ruling party's orders

 The police remained a silent spectator in this heinous scandal and then began to crack the case
 mulaayam singh ne mukhya aaropee ko to chunaavon main party kaa tikat bhi de diya tha
 The recruitment of some suspicious elements into the police under his rule led to a more dangerous trend
 kalyaan singh ke raaj main jab aresas ke karsevak ayodhya main ram janmabhumi-babari masjid ke vivaadit dhaanche ko dhaha rahe the to hajaaron pulicekarmi chupchaap khadey the
 Mayawati has already tarnished her anti-mafia and anti-criminal image by sending maximum notorious criminals to the state legislative council
 yahi nahin, unhone lokayukta dwaara jameen par avaidh kabja karne vaala qaraar die gaye rajesh treepathi ko 2012 main phir basapa ke tikat par chilloopar se chunaav ladvane kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di he
 As Chief Minister, Mulayam Singh also did not learn from his mistakes and patronize the culprits and in 2007 his people were overthrown by the state
 agar mayawati diwaar par likhi chetavanee ko nahin pard paati hai, to unhen bhi apana boyaa hi kaatane ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie

 These days, onion producing farmers in Alwar district, which are ranked first among the onion producing districts of Rajasthan, are facing the recession, the situation is that the arrival of onion is increasing in the agricultural market of Alwar
 lekin kisaanon ko un kaa bhav nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Apart from the farmer and businessman, the laborers working in the mandi are also upset
 notebandi ke kaaran alvar mandi main baahar se aane vaale vyapaariyon ne bhi apana munh modana shuru kar diya he mandi main pyaaj kharidne ke liye is baar vyapaaree bhi kam sankhya main aae hai jahaan pichhali baar 70 se 80 vyapaaree alvar mandi main pyaaj kharidne aate the is baar is se aadhe vyapaaree kii alvar mandi main pyaaj kharidne ke liye aae hai note bandi ke kaaran kisaan ab 500 or 1000 ke note nahin letaa he isliye unhen khule paise chahie lekin vyapaariyon ke paas khule paise nahin hone ke kaaran vah pyaaj kharidne se bhi dar rahaa he
 The farmers are not taking the check, the condition seems to be worse after the payment due to the ban because the farmer is not ready to take payment from the check and the merchant does not have new currency to pay the cash

 Farmers were getting 100 kattas in a bigha last time, this time only 30 kattas have been produced
 pyaaj kii lagaataar bhav girane ke baad ab kisaan note bandi ke kaaran pareshaan hai
 There is no money in the banks
 The farmers told that even if we take payment from the check from the merchants, it takes at least 3 to 4 days to clear the check in the bank, and apart from this, due to the constant crowd in the banks, they had to face a lot of trouble
 When it takes 5-6 hours in line to exchange notes, how will they receive payment, this is also the biggest question in front of farmers because Alav The banks are unable to pay the farmers right now, most of the village banks have not got sufficient funds after demonetisation, so the farmers are facing a lot of difficulty in getting their money from there and after selling the amount of onions, then The farmer knows how much trouble it will cause to withdraw money
 kisaanon ne bataaya ki usne 4 bigha pyaaj kheton main lagaaya tha or kareeb ek lakh rupaye kaa nuksaan hua he
 Money is not available in the mandi from which he has taken a loan, he asks for money every day

 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne hathras main apni sabha main ye baat kahi
 In fact, in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP President Amit Shah has put full strength in the UP elections
 hathras ke sadabad chunaav kshetra main amit shah ne akhilesh-rahul ke alaava bispi par bhi sidhaa hamalaa kiya or logon ke saamne vaadon kii lambii-chaudee list rakh di
 Amit Shah said, "we have decided that if we come to power, slaughterhouses will be closed to protect the livestock of the farmers
" " However, the equations are slightly different this time in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 amit shah kii raily main hamen aise kai log mili jo rojgaar naa milane se pareshaan dikhe
 There was resentment about the fact that the promises made by governments and leaders are not fulfilled
 hathras main bijepi samarthak bhi maanate hai ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sthaneey str par jaateey sameekaran zyada ahm honge
 Bobby says, "this time regional parties have brought caste into the election arena
 2017 ke chunaavon main jati ke aadhaar par vot maange ja rahe hai
 This time the elections are completely different from the 2014 elections
 "tippaniyan In the 2014 elections, Amit Shah gave the BJP a major victory in UP

 Sammy made it clear that he cannot take England's team lightly in their match of the league stage in the ICC World T20
 samine kaha, ‘mujhe kisi ke liye ‘chupa rustam’ jaisaa shabd kahana pasand nahin he
 Usually we are called Chhupa Rustom, their (england) team is very good
 ham pratiyogita main bhaag le rahi prayekatim kaa sammankarte hai
 We saw that the T20 significantly reduced the gap between the teams
 ’unhone kaha, ‘unke (england) ke paas kuch achche khilaadi hai jinhone pichley ek saal main khud ko behtareen cricketer ke rup main badla he
 Such as Jose Butler, Ben Stokes
 iske alaava madhyakram main unka captain eon morgan he
 These are all good players
 isliye ham unhen halke se nahin le sakate hai
 Sammy said that the focus of his team would be on his game rather than the opponent
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin aksar ham is par dhyaan dete hai ki hamen kya karnaa he or ham jaanate hai ki yadi ham aisa kar sakate hai to phir hamaari jeet hogi
 Regarding the absence of players like Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard, the 32-year-old said, "it is always difficult to compensate for players like Narayan and Pollard who have so much experience
" ’westeindies ke paas chote formet kaa sabase dhakad salaami ballebaaj kris gail he or saimi ne kaha, ‘pari ko sanvarna hamaari jimmedaari he or hamaare paas duniya kaa sabase vidhvansak ballebaaj kris gail he
 There has never been too much pressure on Chris
 ham jaanate hai ki kris bahut bada khilaadi he
 'he said,' But if you look at the dressing room, we have many hitters like Bravo, Russell, Kalres
 hamaare liye mahatvapurn yah he ki prayek khilaadi apni bhoomika nibhaae or jimmedaar rahe tathaa apana kaam kisi duusare ke liye nahin chode
 The batsmen will definitely have to make an impact on match day
 ’madhyakram ke bare main saimi ne kaha, ‘hamaare madhyakram main malaren sampuls, dinesh ramdin, dwen braavo, andre rasel jaise sakasham ballebaaj hai
 Bravo is the most experienced player in the team when it comes to playing in Indian conditions
 unke paas moin ali or adil raashid jaise spinner hai lekin ham jaanate hai ki vankhede kaa wicket tej gendbaajon ke anukool he
 This is what we have seen in IPL matches
 ’ Mumbai Test matches will be remembered for centuries by Virat Kohli, Murali Vijay and Jayant Yadav
 saath hi team india ke star spin gendbaaj aar aswin ke yogadan ko bhi phan nahin bhula paaenge

 Ashwin completed 250 wickets in his 43rd Test match
 isse pehle sabase tej 250 viketon tak pahunchane kaa record australia ke mahaan gendbaaj denis lily ke naam tha
 Who did this feat in 48 Tests

 When the election is near, every party is busy in spending but no one is willing to tell where its money came from
 isliye ab sarkaar ne soochna ke adhikaar ke daayre se raajnneetik partiyon ko baahar karne kaa faisla liya he or iske liye sansad main bakaayaada ek bill laayaa jaayegaa
 The Congress is currently the richest party in the country and has more than three thousand crore rupees in its account
 lekin ye paisa kin kaaryakarta yaa chanda dene waalon kaa he ye koi nahin nahin puch saktaa
 For this, the parties do not have to give account of their donations, for this, the government wants to change the law of information which it had made itself and Sonia Gandhi takes full credit
 congress kor group kii baithak main faisla liya gaya ki sarkaar is kanoon ko badalane ke liye ek prastaav laayegi or sansad main ise pesh kiya jaayegaa
 There will also be an all party meeting for this
 sansadeey kaary rajyamantri rajeev shukla ne bataaya, 'ham sari partiyon kii raay lenge or uske hisaab se hi kadam uthaaya jaayegaa
 'the government has to make this change because the Chief Information Commissioner in a decision asked all the six national parties of the country to make information officers in their offices and give the accounts of donations
 inamen congress, bijepi se lekar left partiyaan tak shaamil hai
 But the parties say that she collects more than twenty thousand donations from the check and gives it to the Election Commission
 lekin sab jaanate hai ki 20 hajaar se kam rakam dikhaakar hi kai farji naamon se entry hoti he
 Then the question is that if the accounts of the parties are so clear then why be afraid to tell them
 congress main kabhi kehete the ki na khaataa na bahi jo seetaram kesari kahen vahi sahi
 Kesri was then the treasurer of the Congress
 vakt badal gaya, kesari nahin rahe lekin hisaab ab bhi vaise hi hota he
 The same situation is with every party
 jaahir he raja nahin chahta ki janata jane ki khajaane main kitna maal he

 Superintendent of Police Arvind Kalitha said that the accident happened late at half past one in the night

 At the same time, a woman died in hospital due to serious injury
 ghayal yatriyon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Kalita said that five seriously injured passengers have been sent to Gauhati Medical College Hospital
 bas main kul 35 yatri savaar the
 Some passengers alleged that some of them were stranded between Nagaon and Jakhalbandha cities as there was no more diesel to go ahead in the state government disaster vehicles
 unhone kaha ki ve ilaaj ke liye chaar ghante baad hi nagaanv pahunch sake, jab dijal laakar vaahan main bharaa gaya
 Neither was there anything special on 9 May, nor was there such a feature in the helicopter that we were going from Ranchi to the inauguration of a power sub-station at Kuchai in seraikela-kharsawan district
 lekin 70 minute baad hi usne jivan ko dekhne ke mere nazariye ko hameshaa ke liye badalakar rakh diya
 My wife Meera, who was with me, was sitting on the seat next to me in the helicopter
 vidhayak barkussor gagarai or suraksha adhikari manoj kumaar hamaare saamne kii siton par baithe hue the
 Our 25-minute flight was completely normal, but when the helicopter failed to land at Kuchai, we immediately came to know that there was a serious disturbance in it
 kuchai main jab payalton ne use utaarne kii koshish kii to helicopter achaanak hi dayee ore gum gaya
 They took him back to altitude and made another attempt to take off
 is baar bhi helicopter teji se dayee ore ko mud gaya
 But could not get down
 donon payalton-vipul kumaar singh or jeepies kowshik ne meri taraf ishaara kiya ki main headphone laga luun
 They told me that the rudder on the tail of the helicopter had caused a serious problem
 yah radar hi helicopter kii disha ko sthirataa detaa he
 They wanted to return to Ranchi, where we could get immediate help even if there was no proper landing, and they wanted my permission for it
 maine unki samaj par bharosa jataayaa or unase kaha ki ve jaisaa uchit samajhen, us tarah se is sthiti se nipten
 When i heard the pilots talking to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) of Ranchi, it was 11:50 am
 payalat atisi ko apni samasya se rou-ba-rou kara rahe the or ranchi lautne kii yojana ke bare main bataa rahe the
 Out of those four passengers, i was the only one to know that serious disturbances had occurred in the helicopter
 usee samay mere dimag main ateet main hui helicopter durghatnaon kii baaten ghoomane lageen
 i remember the accident with a BSF helicopter in Jharkhand in October 2011 after a similar disturbance, in which all three people aboard the helicopter were killed
 mujhe arunachal ke mukhyamantri dorji khandu or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri vaai
 s
 rajasekhar reddy ke saath hue haadase bhi bakhubi yaad the, donon hi helicopter durghatnaon main maare gaye the
 i could not remember a single person who could survive a helicopter crash
 meri patni ke ghabaraae hue sawaalon ne mujhe mere vichaaron kii duniya se baahar nikaala
 He said that we are returning back to Ranchi and the helicopter does not seem to be stable
 maine unase kaha ki chintaa kii koi baat nahin he or aisa mere saath pehle bhi ho chukaa he
 The pilots were asking the ATC to completely evacuate the runway of Birsa Munda Airport within 15 minutes
 iske liye ek sheduld udaan ke root ko badla gaya
 i did not interfere in their conversation
 ek baar bhi nahin
 But there was no ray of hope
 helicopter ab bhi buree tarah hichkole kha rahaa tha or anya kai tarah kii chunautiyaan bhi maujuud thim
 i had to show courage, but as Ranchi was getting closer, everything was becoming equally difficult
 tay baat thi ki main mira ko bahut der tak mugalate main nahin rakh saktaa tha
 He was also seen at the Birsa Munda Airport by rescue teams and fire brigades
 ve thodaa ghabara gai thim or unhone sab kuch bhagya bharose chhod diya
 He asked me to call someone in the family to take care of our three children
 bhavuk hona or vah phone karnaa aasaan tha, jo us samay mahatvapurn najar aa rahaa tha
 So i switched off my mobile phone, because by making such a call, the desire to do the same among the other passengers would start hitting, which could make the pilots nervous
 payalat helicopter ko jameen par utaarne kii koshishon main lage the or kam-se-kam chah chakkar laga chuke the
 They also wanted all the fuel to be spent before landing the crash, so that the risk of explosion could be minimized
 ham jameen par utarane ke liye taiyaar ho rahe the
 i tightened my seat and Meera's seat belt, comforted her and the rest of the people and got ready
 haalanki disha par niyantran main gadabadi ke kaaran helicopter kii gati kam ho gai thi, phir bhi vah jameen par utarane ke baad palatiyaan kha saktaa tha
 But Pilot brought the helicopter to a height of about 15 feet, and they stopped both of its engines
 helicopter hawaondde ke bichobich dhadaam se gira or hawaipattee ke pashchim kii ore palat gaya
 My left hand got stuck in the broken door of the helicopter
 main bol nahin paa rahaa tha, lekin maine bachaav dal ko ishaara kiya ki meraa haath nikaalen, kyonki mujhe bahut zyada dard ho rahaa tha
 i remember that i was smiling, because we all survived
 main bistar par hum tathaa kuch hafte or bistar par rahoonga, par mujhe lagata he ki yah punarjanm tha
 God has given me this new life
 meraa iraadaa iskaa bharpoor istemaal karne kaa he or samaaj ko vah sab kuch lautaanaa he jo usne mujhe diya he

 This song is from the Bollywood film Chhote Sarkar released 23 years ago
 is gane ko film star govinda or shilpa shetty kii jodi par filmaaya gaya tha
 The songs shown on this song helped govinda-shilpa's stardom, but many people in Bihar and UP did not like the lyrics
 1997 main pakur (ab jharkhand main) sijeem kii court main govinda or shilpa ke khilaaf shikaayat darj kii gai
 The petition said that this song is contemptuous of bihar-up with being obscene
 yachika mohini mohan tiwari kii ore se daakhil kii gai
 Taking strict cognizance, the CJM issued a notice to Govinda and Shilpa under sections 294 (obscene song) and 500 (contempt)
 lekin us notice kii thik paton par taamil nahin ho saki
 In such a situation, Govinda and Shilpa unaware of the court proceedings did not appear before the court
 baad main court ne donon ke khilaaf gair jamaanti warrant jari kiye
 When Govinda came to know about this, he knocked the door of the High Court in 2001 and appealed to stay the proceedings in CJM Court at Pakur
 shilpa ne bhi vaisaa hi kiya jaisaa ki govinda ne kiya
 After 23 years of filing the petition, Govinda and Shilpa finally got relief in this case
 justise amitabh gupta ne govinda or shilpa ke haq main faisla sunaaya
 Justice Gupta said in the judgment that the general rule does not apply to film stars as the film was passed by the Censor Board under the Cinematography Act, 1952
 justise gupta ne nichali adaalat kaa aadesh radd karne ke saath govinda or shilpa shetty ko raahat di
 Only after 23 years, on getting relief, govinda-shilpa must have said that the end is good

 iske baad bisisiai nae coach kii talash main he or iske liye purv captain or maujuuda under-19 or india-e team ke coach rahul dravid ko ye jimmedaari saunpane ke bare main soch rahi he
 According to reports, when the BCCI Advisory Committee spoke to Dravid in this regard, he said to consider it
 matlab dravid ne inkaar nahin kiya he
 When Dravid was asked about this last time after the 2015 World Cup, he denied it and said he wanted to spend time with family and was not ready for the coach's fulltime job
 isiilie unhone india e or under-19 team kaa coach bananaa munasib samajha
 The name of Sourav Ganguly was also in the discussion with him last time, but now he cannot fulfill this responsibility as he is now the President of Bengal Cricket Association
 dravid kii baat karen to wo ipel ke naunve sizan main dilli dairedevills team ke mentor kaa bhaar sanbhaalenge
 In such a situation, he is playing the role of mentor and coaching completely and there is hardly anyone better than him at this time
 dravid ne rajasthan royles ke liye bhi pehle shandaar bhoomika nibhaai
 This year, under his coaching, the Indian Under-19 team traveled to the final in the World Cup
 khabaren ye bhi hai ki is baar bisisiai 2019 vishwa cap tak ke liye coach chahta he or aisa coach jo bhartiya yuva ballebaazon ko test ke liye bhi taiyaar kar sake aisa isliye ki agle 1 saal main bharat ko kareeb 18 test match khilne hai

 This decision can be taken after the World Cup final and also before the IPL starting on 9 April, but Anurag Thakur also made it clear that there will be no two posts this time, this time the role of team director and fulltime coach is one
 He will play the person baharhaal ravi shastri bhi apana qaraar ke navinikaran ke liye aavedan de sakate hai

 That is why he considered it appropriate to be the coach of India a and Under-19 team
 pichhali baar unke saath saurav ganguli kaa naam bhi charchaa main tha, lekin ab wo is zimmedaari ko nahin nibhaa sakate kyonki ab wo bengal cricket sangh ke adhyaksh hai

 " These days a video is becoming very viral on social media, an aircraft in which passengers are sitting but there is a lot of dirt
 is kadar ganda hawaii jahaaj kam hi logon ne dekha hoga
 It is being said that this is an Air India flight in which Haj pilgrims were going
 fasebukaurainstagrampar share ho rahe 52 second ke is video main dekha ja saktaa he ki hawaii jahaaj main har taraf gandagi kii bharmaar he
 Dirty paper, toilet paper are scattered all over the floor of the ship and the toilet seat is also dirty
 isi video se liye gaye chitra yahaan dekhe ja sakate hai
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the claim being made in this viral video is false
 naa to yah air india kii flite he or naa hi isamen haj yatri baithe hue hai
 Actually this video is at least three years old and has been circulating on the internet since 2016
 pehle chhapi hui kai khabaron ke mutabik yah saudi arabian airlines kii flite he jo saudi arab ke jedda se ithopia ke addis ababa ja rahi thi
 Many users have shared this misleading post, including the Facebook page "farzi Baaten"
 soshal media par kiye ja rahe bhraamak daavon main is video ko sampradayik rang dene kii bhi koshish kii ja rahi he kyonki video main dikh rahaa he ki kai log sir par us tarah kii topi pahane hai jise aamtaur par muslim pahante hai
 On this basis, many people are claiming that the ship has Haj pilgrims and it was an Air India flight
 video kii sachai jaanane ke liye jab hamane iskaa reverse search kiya to hamen pataa chalaa ki 6 sitambar 2016 ko 'livlik' naam ke ek website ne isi video ke saath ek khabar chhaapi thi jiskaa sheershak tha "saudi arabian airlines kii airbas A330 kii khasta haalat" 
 After searching on the internet, we also found an article of 'dailymail' in which this video was mentioned
 yah artical bhi 6 sitambar 2016 ko hi chapa tha
 According to this article, this flight was the first flight of Saudi Arabian Airlines to Jeddah to Addis Ababa which was inaugurated on the same day
 'arab news' ke artical main bhi yahi kahani doharaai gai he
 According to the news of Arab News, there were people in this flight who were being illegally evacuated from the country after being in Saudi Arabia
 kuch samay pehle yahi video ek duusare daawey ke saath viral ho rahaa tha
 It was then said that it was a British Airways flight from London to Islamabad
 tabaianf Fact Checkne isaki sachai bataai thi
 On the basis of all this evidence it can be said that this surprisingly dirty flight has nothing to do with Air India or Haj pilgrims from India

 Jayakumar said, "we are going to shore up the Dinakaran family in the interest of the party", though like many others in the AIADMK, he too once accepted Dinakaran's sudden rise to sky high

 It was the former assembly seat of Jayalalithaa, who died in December 2016, leaving her party as well as the state headless

 About 90 crores to buy votes on Dinakaran

 He had already been accused that he had to pay Rs 50 crore to persuade the Election Commission officials to take a decision in favor of the AIADMK in the controversy over the party's election symbol 'do Patti'

 This dispute is called Sasikala, Chinnamma (aunt), who sees him as the heir to her beloved Amma, and o

 Panneerselvam was declared Chief Minister after Jayalalithaa's death
 jab unke saathiyon ne jayalalita kii jagah lene ke liye shashikala ke paksh main joardaar maang kii, to ve bhi apane sahyogiyon ke saath rahe, lekin farvari main unhone chaunkaane vaala pintara badla or daawa kiya ki unhen istipha dene ke liye shashikala ne majaboor kiya tha

 After the announcement that Sasikala and Dinakaran would be excluded from playing any role in the government and in the party, Panneerselvam called it 'the first step in our crusade'
 lagata he ki dinkaran ne apane bhagya ko sweekaar kar liya he, lekin party ko ekajute karne ke liye annadramuk ko abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 Like, first thing is, who will be its leader? Will Panneerselvam be its leader, who Jayalalithaa herself had chosen three times, and who claims to have the support of the central government? Others within the AIADMK, despite the Dravidian ideology of working towards a casteless society, consider it a virtue that Palanisamy represents the Gounder community of western Tamil Nadu
 ek aisi party main aam sahmati kaa aadhaar khoj paanaa kathin kaam he, jo ab jayalalita ke karishme or ichhashakti ke boote ekajute nahin he
 But, since no AIADMK MLA wants to risk an early election, some way has to be found to support the government
 yahaan tak ki pratidwandvi diemke bhi nae chunaav kaa kharch uthaanaa pasand nahin karegi
 But the Tamil Nadu government needs to restore its credibility soon, otherwise it risks losing the trust and patience of the increasingly restless public
