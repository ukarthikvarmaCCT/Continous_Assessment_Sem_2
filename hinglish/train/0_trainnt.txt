 But we have never been able to ask this small question: Why is it so far to achieve peace? Why has it been so difficult to establish peace more than to end the confrontation? 12

 The Central Government said in the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the collegium system for appointment of judges has proved to be unsuccessful and opaque
 sarkaar ne sarvocch adaalat main yah bhi poocha ki desh ke tatkaaleen chif justise kii najdiki rishtedaar 59 varshiya mahila kaise kalakatta hai court kii jaj niyukt kar di gai
 The judge's objection was ignored
 In 2010, Justice Kabir's sister Kabir Sinha Shukla was appointed as the Calcutta High Court
 is maamle main hai court ke collegium ne justise bhattacharya kii aapatti ko nazarandaaj kar diya tha
 On behalf of the government, Attorney General Mukul Rohti said that one of the five judges of the High Court Collegium had opposed it and also wrote a letter
 lekin chunki unhone mahila vakil kii jaj ke taur par niyukti kaa unki umr or shaikshanik kaabiliyat ke aadhaar par virodh kiya tha isliye sarvocch adaalat tak unke pahunchane ke raste band kar die gaye
 On the collegium system, the government said that the way of collegium has failed because it is an opaque system which has strangled democracy
 atorni general ke collegium system par hamalaa bolne or 1993 ke faisle kii vrahat peeth dwaara punarvichaar karne kii maang kiye jane par sheersh adaalat ne sanket diya ki vah unki daleel samaapt hone se pehle bhi is maamle par faisla kar sakati he
 Continuing arguments before a five-judge bench on a petition challenging the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, he said, "democracy is back today with the new system being withdrawn
" paardarshee nahin he systemrohatagi kaa kahana he ki ki pichhali vyavastha main paardarshita kaa abhaav tha jo is tathy se spasht he ki artiai kanoon ke tahat bhi collegium pranali ke kaam karne par samoochee soochna saamne nahin aa rahi he
 The bench has questioned him for reconsidering the 1993 decision of the apex court to place the Chief Justice's opinion as paramount in the appointment of judges in the judiciary
 atorni general ne nyaayamurti je es khehar kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ke samaksh kaha, artiai ke jamaane main kyon koi bhi collegium ke faislon ko jaanane ke paksh main nahin he? unhone maang kii ki maamle ko 1993 main faisla sunaane vaale nau nyaayadhishon kii peeth se adhik badi peeth ke paas bheja jaae
 He said that a particular system for appointment of judges cannot be called the basis of independence of the judiciary, which is subject to many checks and balances under the Constitution and the new law has restored democracy in the process

 com india today minderox ke ahm seshan di note so ediat box kaa theme tha ki kaise televijan ko ek intelegent yuva ke liye intelegent banaaya ja saktaa he
 (intelligent Television for Intelligent Youth) The session was attended by actors Vivek Oberoi, Tanuj Virwani and actress Nidhi Singh
 satr kaa sanchaalan india today ke dipti editor sushant mehta ne kiya
 'digital' is rapidly replacing film and theater in the world of entertainment
 bada-chota bollywood kalakaar na sirf badi screen ko chhodkar choti screen par pahunch rahaa he, balki unki koshish digital ke saath-saath soshal medium par pakad banane kii he
 Vivek Oberoi said that only 2 out of 125 crore people of the country
 5 karod log theatre main jaakar film dekhte hai
 At the same time, with the help of mobile and social media, 50 to 60 crore people are being reached
 actor tanuj veeravani ne kaha ki digital medium televijan or theatre se alag isliye bhi hai kyonki digital medium main kalakaar or darshak ke bich koi nahin he
 Here the viewer is so eager to watch a web series that he sees a series of 8-10 episodes at a time
 tanuj kaa maananaa he kiweb siries main kaam karnaek kalakaar ke liye film or televijan ke mukaable zyada acha he
 The artist gets a chance to stay in his character for a long time to work in a web series
 vah apane carator ko paryaapt samay de paata he, jisase uski acting main samay ke saath acha sudhaar bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Vivek Oberoi said that the biggest advantage of digital is that programs built here do not have to face the sensor board
 vivek ne darasal maujuuda samay kii filmameking main sensor board kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Vivek said that in the digital world, sensors are board dinosaurs
 bas unhen filmon main bhi khatm karne kii jarurat he
 Flattery is becoming common in Indian politics
 soshal media par haal kii ek ghatana ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Actually, the reason for this has become a photo, which is going viral
 isamen chhattisgarh main bani nai congress sarkaar ke ek cabinet mantri ties singhdev ko rahul ke pair choote dikhaaya gaya he
 Let me tell you that Minister Singhdev is much older than Rahul Gandhi
 'india against Presstitudes' naam ke fasebuk pej par is photo ko post kiya gaya
 Also the caption was given - '48 years senior blessing his junior of 80 years
 mere dost pappu ji bahut dayaalu hai
 'thousands of people shared this post and hundreds of people commented on it
 in coment memrahul gandhiore congress samskruti par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Many people questioned the reliability of the photo as photoshopped
 india today fact check ne apni padtaal main paaya ki photo asli he
 Chhattisgarh minister TS Singhdev really bowed to Rahul
 soshal tamaasha or ai saport modi ji and bijepi naam ke fasebuk pejon par bhi is tasviir ko post kiya gaya he
 All the sarcasm was done on the Congress President
 is tasviir main dekha ja saktaa he ki safed baalo vaala ek shaks rahul ke saamne jhuk rahaa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also seen standing behind Rahul and has a bouquet of flowers in his hands
 laal galeeche par varisht congress netaa arpyen singh bhi khadey dikhaai de rahe hai
 India Today spoke to TS Singhdev on the claims being made on social media about the picture
 is par singhdev ne saaf kiya ki ye tasviir 17 disambar ko shapath grahan samaaroh kii he
 When Rahul came there, he was present there
 haalanki singhdev ke mutabik unhone rahul ke pair chune kii koshish nahin kii thi, bas unase haath milaayaa tha
 According to Singhdev, the picture is Photoshop
 iske saath hi singhdev ne mana ki khaas maukon par unki varisht party netaaon ke pair chhukar aashirwad lene kii aadat he, bhale hi unki umr kuch bhi ho
 Singhdev said, 'even that day, after swearing, i touched the feet of the guests sitting on the stage
 ’singh dev ne kaha, ‘mantri ke taur par apni shapath lene ke thik baad maine manch par rahul gandhi ke pair chune kii bhi koshish kii thi, lekin unhone mujhe aisa karne se roak diya tha
 Singh Dev had actually touched the feet of the guests sitting on the stage and was stopped by Rahul Gandhi
 is ghatana ko neeche video main dekha ja saktaa he
 We did not find any other video that could prove the events captured in the viral picture
 hamen aisa koi saboot bhi nahin mila jo singhdev ke is daawey kii pushti kar saktaa ki tasviir photoshop he
 When we wanted to know from Singhdev what exactly happened at that time, he gave contradictory statements
 unhone jameen se roomaal uthaane jaisi baat bhi kahi, lekin aisa koi roomaal tasviir main nahin dikhataa
 a closer look at the picture shows that the characters appearing in the picture have their shadow in the right alignment
 isse bhi sanket miltaa he ki tasviir asli he
 a local newspaper Rajasthan Patrika also published a viral picture and claimed that the minister was actually trying to catch the thread hanging on the floor with a bouquet held by Dr
 Manmohan Singh
 lekin tasviir main ye dekha ja saktaa he ki dhaagaa kahin bhi jameen ke najadik nahi tha
 It can also be seen that Singhdev was bowing down in front of Rahul and not Manmohan Singh who was just a few steps away
 hamane congress netaa arpyen singh se bhi baat kii jo vahaan maujuud the
 He confirmed that Singhdev had tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but Rahul had stopped him before doing so
 pradhanmantri kii khaadi ke calendar main photo ko lekar vivaad or tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala has compared Gandhi's ideology to the pm's ideology, tweeting Modi and Gandhiji's photos together
 pradhanmantri par tanj kasate hue randeep ne twit kiya ki gandhi kii vichaardhaara thi ki jab bhi khud par shaq ho to sabase garib or kamjor varg kii socho
 Make him think ahead and plan ahead, but Modi's ideology is focused on himself
 'piem ko garib se zyada prachaar kii chintaa'surajevaala ne kaha kipiemki chintaa apane piaar campan par zyada he
 Which kurta to wear? How to look? What to tweet? And whatsapp to do? This is the ideology of PM Modi
 congress ke varisht netaa sanjay singh ne bhi isi mudde ko or aage le jate hue kaha ki gandhi or modi kii tulana nahin ho sakati
 Gandhiji's talisman v / s Modiji's talisman

 He has a reputation not only in the country but also abroad
 unka kahana he ki iske jariye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh kii garima or bhaawanaaon ko thes pahunchaai he
 In this dispute, all opposition parties were standing on a table with the Congress in this dispute
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne is puure masale ko rafa-dfa karte hue kaha ki isamen koi vivaad unako nahin dikhataa or gandhi kii tasviir chapana koi tay niyam yaa kanoon nahin he

 As soon as the proceedings of the House began, the Samajwadi Party mlas started a fierce uproar
 sapa vidhayaakon ne binar or takhti lekar pradarshan kiya or yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji kii
 Governor Ramnaik gave his address amid the uproar of mlas
 is dauraan unki ore kaagaj ke gole bhi phenke gaye
 SP mlas were creating a ruckus over the violence in Kasganj and the law and order issue in the state
 bataa den, upi main bajet satr 16 march tak chalegaa
 Before the session started, they were doing a ruckus, that before the budget session of the UP Assembly started on Thursday, the opposition had prepared to surround the government
 isi kadi main satr shuru hone se pehle hi sapa vidhayakon ne vidhansabha ke baahar baith kar bhi pradarshan kiya
 SP mlas were demonstrating in front of Chaudhary Charan Singh's statue at the main gate of Vidhan Bhavan
 isse pehle sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye vidhansabha adhyaksh hriday narayan dikshit ne buudhvaar ko sarvadaleey baithak bulaai thi
 In this meeting, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly had asked the SP mlas to allow the House to function
 lekin is apil ko bhi vidhayakon ne ansuna kar diya or aaj binar-takhti or gubaare lekar sapa vidhayak sadan pahunche
 During this time, SP mlas were shouting slogans against the Yogi government
 akhilesh ne bulaai thi vidhanmandal dal kii baithkbajet satr ke maddenjar sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne buudhvaar ko party ke vidhanmandal dal kii baithak bulaai thi
 During this time, he had said that the BJP government should tell how much of the first budget was used, because they are going to present the second budget

 n (@ d6f88ac54f8e40e) August 4, 2017 vitt varsh 2014-15 jari he or antarim bajet bhi aa chukaa he
 The scope of major changes in tax expenditure in the first year is also very limited
 isliye nai sarkaar kaa mukhya dhyaan bajet main maamuli herpher karne par hona chahie, jisase bhavishya ke vittiya kadamon kii disha tay ho or jahaan tak sambhav ho sake, us nai disha kii ore badha jaae
 On the tax front, the revised budget should mainly focus on reforms in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) by March 31, 2016
 saath hi rajyon kaa vishwaas hasil karne ke liye kendriya bikri kar kii mad main unke bakaae ko chuktaa karne par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 The revised budget should also show the commitment to implement the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) from the next financial year
 jahaan tak maujuuda varsh kaa sawaal he to is varsh main uske majamoon main pherbadal karke us par sahmati banane kii koshish honi chahie
 In the budget, investors should also be assured that the government will not take steps to collect tax from previous dates
 aisa kiye jane se ve nivesh ab laabhadaayak nahin rah jaaenge, jo shuruyaat main munafa dete prathit ho rahe the
 Along with this, the government should also warn people that tax evasion will not be tolerated at all
 saath hi sarkaar ko yah bhi spasht kar dena chahie ki kar chori kii jaanch-padtaal bahut kadai ke saath or tej gati se kii jaaegi
 As an industry economist, i would advise the government to return to trade-industry reforms in case of immediate economic reforms
 ye sudhaar kaary 2007-08 se latake hue hai
 We can start by reducing the high industrial tax rate from 10 percent to 7 percent
 kharch ke morche par antarim bajet main puunjigat kharch ko sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ke 1
 Must be increased from 76 percent to 2 percent
 bajet main rajyon dwaara samvidhan kii samavarti suchi ke vishyon se sambandhit kendriya kanoonon main sanshodhan ke liye raashtrapati kii manjuuri kii apil par bhi sarkaar ko tay samay ke bheetar faisla lene kii patibaddhta dikhaani chahie
 In the first year itself, the process of reform of land, labor and social laws will begin
 kaabo paaen rajkoshiya ghate parapaanch saal main sarkaar ko paryaapt rajkoshiya majbootee hasil kar leni chahie
 The government must ensure that in any case the fiscal deficit in the Union Budget 4 every year
 5 pratishat se kam ho
 The result will be that the debt-to-gdp ratio will decrease as growth accelerates
 kar ke morche par, jiesti or ditisi kii sthapana ke baad mukhya masalaa kar or jidipi kaa anupaat badhanaa hi rah jayega, jo bharat main kaaphi kam bana hua he
 For this, measures such as widening the tax net and reforming tax administration with creative use of information technology are needed
 misaal ke taur par krishi aay par kar na lagane se karadhaan kaa dayera sikudakar kam ho jaataa he or kar chori main bhi badhotaree hoti he
 At least an effort should be made to bring urban agricultural income under the tax net
 isi tarah, parohn kar kaa aadhaar bhi badhanaa chahie
 Tax departments need to take more advantage of information exchange
 centre tathaa rajya kar vibhaagon or kendriya pratyaksh kar board tathaa kendriya utpaada or seemaa shulk vibhaag ke bich soochnaaon ke zyada aadan-pradaan kii darkaar he
 On the expenditure front, the government will need to increase its share of GDP from a modest 4 percent to capital expenditure by the fifth year, which was the level in 2003-04
 yah bijli samet infrastracchar ke morche par kami ko dur karne ke liye paryaapt rajasav jutaney ke liye jaruri hoga
 In this way electricity will also be available to a large population
 sarkaar ko swasthya ke mad main kharch ko bhi maujuuda jidipi ke 1
 2 of GDP for the fifth year, increasing from 3 percent
 5 pratishat tak le janaa hoga
 This will be necessary for steps such as providing drinking water from the pipeline, arranging toilets and improving public health services to reach a larger population
 kharch main is badhotaree ke saath-saath rajkoshiya majbootee kaa lakshya bhi rakhaa jaae to kar-jidipi anupaat badhaane kaa upaay hi paryaapt nahin hoga
 The government will have to cut subsidies
 desh main petrol, dijal, mitti ke tel, rasoi gas, khaad, bijli or pani se sambandhit anek sabsidi ke kaaran aarthik kushalta prabhavit hoti he, jabaki ye riyaayaten mukhya rup se garibon se itar tabake ko laabh pahunchaati hai
 Don't waste money
 Steps to end subsidies for petrol and diesel have begun and they should be allowed to reach a logical conclusion
 nishchit hi khaad par sabsidi bhi dhire-dhire khatm kerani chahie kyonki isse khaad kaa istemaal kaaphi bad rahaa he
 Soil and environment are being destroyed due to increasing use of manure
 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ne yah prakriya shuru kii thi, lekin upie sarkaar ne use ulat diya
 Subsidies on both electricity and water have caused losses
 khaas taur par sinchai main pani kii barbaadi badi he
 Drip irrigation and other water-saving methods should be encouraged by eliminating these concessions
 haalanki in upayon ko apnaane ke baad bhi rajkoshiya majbootee kaa lakshya hasil karnaa sambhav nahin hoga kyonki saamaajik kshetra or infrastracchar par bade hue kharch kii bharpai kerani hogi
 Therefore, the government will have to return to massive disinvestment measures
 isse bhi arthvyavastha kii kshamta main ijapha hoga
 Along with this, the government should move towards direct privatization of some public units, which have no hope of revival
 yojana or gaiyr-yojanagat kharch kaa fark mitna chahie
 For this, there should be a transfer of funds from the Union Budget to the states
 centre pryojit yojanaon ke tahat madad ke swaroop ko badalakar rajyon ke liye maanak zyada lacheele banaae jane chahie
 Many types of schemes should be divided into large items like agriculture, health, education and infrastructure and states should be exempted to spend any amount on any item
 philhal is tarah kii 66 yojanaayen hai
 The ultimate goal of the government should be that the Center should give grants in place of schemes and the central government should pay attention to the system of performance and monitoring
 desh main vittiya sudhaaron ko lagu karne kaa agenda dekhne main kaaphi kathin or mahatvakankshi lag saktaa he, lekin drudh sankalp sarkaar kii hadon ke baahar nahin he

 Kohli got India to win 'virat', he said, 'there is a lot of information available about each player so that it can be analyzed
 internet maujuud he or iske alaava match kii ricarding bhi maujuud he
 So there are plenty of options and i don't think we (kirsten and mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton) have anything different to offer
 ’australia ke khilaaf mukaable se virendra sahvaag ko baahar karne ke bare main karston ne kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 South Africa have lost two consecutive matches in the Super Eight and the coach admitted that his team will have to take the right decisions
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare paas donon match jeetne kaa mauka tha lekin hamane ise ganvaa diya
 When we left for South Africa for the T20 World Cup, everyone said that our team is balanced
 ahm lamhon ke dauraan hamane acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 Pakistan had taken seven wickets around our 60 runs and we should have won this match

 As a result, he could not control the car and the car climbed onto the pavement
 haalanki vishesh sarkari vakil pradeep gharat ne jab usase poocha ki itane saal chup kyon rahe? police ne agar nahin suna to media ke paas ja sakate the
 Could have consulted a lawyer
 aise sabhi sawaalon kaa ashok singh ke paas bas ek hi jawaab tha ki use kuch samaj hi nahin aa rahaa tha ki kya kare
 Then how come now? On asking this, the driver's answer was that Salim saheb said that go tell the truth

 Later, while speaking to the media outside the court, the government lawyer made it clear that in all these years he had never heard that Ashok Singh was driving the car that night

 No opposition will be seen, however, many opposition parties including Congress, Left parties, TMC will distance themselves from this program

 The Aam Aadmi Party too will not participate in this program of Parliament
 AAP kii ore se kaha gaya he ki unhen iske lagu hone or tex strecchar par dikkat he
 'aaj Tak' will run for a day, GST Conclave, veteran ministers and experts will answer every question That she will regret this decision, if not today or tomorrow

 Hate-filled statements, speeches and comments are common as soon as the election comes
 bade log bhi apana badppan chhodkar badi choti baaten karne lag jate hai
 In the race to degrade each other, they say such things which are beyond the limits of decency
 kai baar to aise shabdon kaa istemaal hota he ki hairaani hoti he
 Say anything about someone as if it has become part of social behavior
 lekin khushi kii baat yah he ki supreme court kaa dhyaan is ore gaya he or usne vidhi ayog ko bhadakaau bhaashanon or nafrat failaane vaali bayanon par niyantran karne ke liye maargdarshika banane ko kaha he
 This was very important because it does not take long for the leaders to slip their tongue and they say anything unrestrained
 deshadrohi, gaddaar, hitler jaise shabd to aam ho chuke hai
 Many ministers of the UPA government have made such comments on their rivals that it is surprising to hear and even more sad
 lagata he ki desh chalaane vaale hi bhadrata kii bhashaa bhul gaye hai
 Opposition parties talk like this in frustration and disappointment, but it is surprising to hear this from the mouths of the ruling leaders
 unase kam se kam jimmedaari bhare shabdon kii ummid kii jaati he
 After the intervention of the court or after the Law Commission has issued a guide, things may change now
 ho saktaa he kuch netaa yaa raajnneetik kaaryakarta badal jaaen or tahazeeb seekhney kii koshish karen lekin yah kahana mushkil he ki sabhi badal hi jaaenge
 Tehzeeb does not come in a day nor does the ritual
 ye sab varshon ke prayaas se aate hai or wo jo kuntha yaa nafrat se bhare hue log hai unamem kitna badlaav ho saktaa he? kya koi nayaa niyam ban jane se ve badal jaaenge? kya raajnneetik dal apane netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko bhashaa kii shaleenta sikhayenge? sawaal kathin hai
 But now that the water had started going above the head, a reaction had to take place
 ab yah ek acha kadam he or aane vaale samay main iskaa kuch asar to dikhegaa hi
 Wait till then nae sahyogiyon ko jodne ke liye bijepi ko dharmanirpekshata ke liye apni vachanabaddhata ko phir se pesh karne ke laal krishna adwani ke suzav par hangaamaa ho gaya he
 Senior RSS leader MG Vaidya says that he does not understand why Advani is saying this
 jabaki congress ko lagata he ki adwani ne narendra modi ko aage badhane se rokane ke liye hi yah bayaan diya he taaki nitish jaise sahyogi modi ke bajaay unke naam par taiyaar ho jaaen
 Advani says that in order to increase the nda's clan, it is necessary that BJP should put its commitment to secularism again in front of people
 isse pehle, nitish ne kaha tha ki endie kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar secular chhavi kaa hona chahie
 The debate also becomes bigger because during the boom of Ram temple movement, Advani had raised the slogan of pseudo secularism
 haalanki pakistan yatra main adwani ne jinna ko secular bataakar chhavi badalane kii koshish kii jisase sangh parivaar main ubaal aa gaya tha or ab ek baar phir aresas se jude logon ke tevar tikhe ho gaye hai
 The comments vaise, bijepi ke bade netaa maanate hai ki adwani ne aisa kuch nahin kaha jisase modi ke raste main rukaawat aae kyonki narendra modi bhi pichley ek saal se apni kattar chhavi ko badalane kii waisi hi kavayad main jute hai jaisi koshish adwani ne kii thi
 It was started by Modi with Sadbhavna Mission and this time like last time his election speeches are not against Muslims
 lekin sawaal yah he ki kya alpsankhyakon ke naam par raajnneeti karne vaale mamata banerjee, naveen patnayak or chandrababu naidu jaise netaa modi kaa saath de sakate hai
 Perhaps that is why the question has arisen whether Advani has taken this bet to fulfill his desire to become Prime Minister
 adwani kaa kahana he ki endie kaa kunba badhaane ke liye zaruri he ki bijepi dharmanirpekshata ko lekar apni patibaddhta ko phir se logon ke saamne rakhe
 Earlier, Nitish had said that the nda's prime ministerial candidate should be of secular image
 bahes isliye bhi badi ho jaati he kyonki ram mandir andolan ke ufaan ke vakt adwani ne chhadam dharmanirpekshata kaa naaraa uchhaala tha
 However, during his visit to Pakistan, Advani tried to change the image by calling Jinnah a secular, which brought the Sangh Parivar to a boil, and now once again people belonging to RSS have become sharper
 tippaniyan By the way, the big leaders of BJP believe that Advani did not say anything that hindered Modi's path because Narendra Modi has also been trying to change his staunch image for the last one year as Advani had tried
 isaki shuruyaat modi ne sadbhaavna mishan se kii or pichhali baar kii tarah is baar unke chunavi bhaashan musalamaanon ke khilaaf nahin hai
 But the question is whether leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik and Chandrababu Naidu, who do politics in the name of minorities, can support Modi
 shaayad isiilie sawaal uthaa he ki kya adwani ne pradhanmantri banane kii ichha puri karne ke liye yah daanv chalaa he

 There is just a need to pay attention to some habits and if the partner says something in displeasure, then you have to refrain from talking about those things
 jaraa-jaraa si baat par rishte tut jate hai
 Many times the silence of love-filled relationships dissolves poison
 yaad rakhen koi bhi rishta pyaar, vishwaas or kamitment maangata he
 The maximum bitterness in the relationship has started due to lack of time
 kisi kaa sachcha saath har gam ko khushi main badalane ke liye kaaphi hota he
 So keep your relationship very well
 is maamle main ye 5 baaten aapaki madad kar sakati hai :1
 Take time out for a partner It is also very important to spend good time with relatives to give long life to the relationship
 agar aap apane partner ko samay nahin denge to isse communication gap hoga or aap donon ke bich khalipan aane lagegaa
 Going forward, this emptiness can become the reason for breakdown
 isliye apane partner kii pasand-naapsand, hobbi or uske kariyar gols ke bare main baat karnaa aapke bich baton kaa silsilaa jari rakhane main madad kar saktaa he
 Sometimes joking and laughing without talking will keep your relationship from becoming monotonous
 2
 Maintain mutual trust in strengthening the faith
 apane rishte ko eemaandaar banaae rakhane ke liye ek-duusare par bharosa karnaa seekhen or rishte ko bachaane ke liye kabhi jhooth kaa sahaara na len
 Lies give birth to suspicion and doubt is enough to spoil a good relationship
 3
 Do not keep hope that there is a lot of difference between movies and movies, take this thing in your mind well
 apane saathi kii tulana apane kisi bhi kareebi rishtedaar yaa phir saheli ke pati se na karen
 Everyone has a different nature, understand this
 khud bhi free hokar jien or unhen bhi unki pasand se jine den
 If you try to tie your partner according to yourself, then in some time you will get clipped
 4
 Avoid negative things, do not talk about your personal things in front of anyone, nor make fun of your partner
 har samay apane partner ko jaj karnaa bhi chhod den
 By doing this, tension will remain between you all the time and gradually you can create hatred between you
 aapas kii baton milakar sulajhane kaa prayaas karen or kabhi bhi kisi tisare se salaah lene se bachein
 5
 sanyam se kaam lenhar rishte main ladaai-jhagade hote hai
 This does not mean that you should shout and talk
 jab bhi bahes hoto khud par sanyam rakhen
 It is said that whenever a fight happens, it is good for a person to be silent
 isliye jab bhi aisa ho, baat kii gaharaai ko samajhate hue hi koi faisla len

 That is, if this happens, Bollywood shoots can be locked up from May 6, because all the technicians working behind the camera in the film industry together have warned the producers to go on strike
 da sound association of india ke adhyaksh bean tiwari ne bataaya kii 'FWICE ke under main workars kii 22 sansthaaen aati hai or ham sabane bollywood main kaam karne waalon ko bataa diya he ki 6 may se ham sab hadtaal par ja rahe hai, isliye wo desh ke kisi bhi hisse main shooting kar rahe hon 5 may kii shaam apana pakup karke mumbai laut aaen
 We have informed all the organizations of the manufacturers that if our demand is not met then we will all go on strike, for which our meeting is going on
 agar hamaari maangen maan lee gayi to hadtaal ruk bhi sakati he, kyonki ham yahaan kaam karne aae hai
 We should get bread instead of hard work
 ' FWICE comes under 22 organizations including unions ranging from Lightman, Spot Boys, Sound Engineers to Video Editors and Cinematographers
 inaki maangon main mukhya hai kamgaaron kii suraksha, kyonki kai baar haadason kii vajah se inaki maut ho jaati he
 These bare feet climb the open wires of electricity, hanging from high ceilings for lighting
 isliye inke liye sefti belt, helmet or juuton kaa intezaam nirmaataa kii taraf se hona chahie

 isi ko lekar yogi adityanath aaj kaha ki mahapurushon ke janm ke din chuttee band honi chahie
 However, he said this on Bhimrao Ambedkar Jayanti, so his opponents can raise questions as to why you chose this day for this question

 kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ke maamle par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan ke baad sarkaar ne ab apana rukh sakht kar liya he
 The opposition did not allow the Rajya Sabha to function despite Modi's statement, and he is adamant on demanding Sadhvi's resignation
 isi tarah loksabhaa main bhi pradhanmantri ke bayaan kii maang ko lekar kaarywahi kaa bahishkaar kiya gaya
 a censure motion has also been suggested by the opposition to remove the impasse in Parliament
 sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri ne yah suzav diya, jiske mutabik bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ja saktaa he ki yah sadan aise bayanon kii ninda karata he, lekin sarkaar ab vipaksh ke aage or jhukne ko taiyaar nahin he
 The government has said that if such a proposal comes, then it should refer to all such controversial statements made since 1952, including Sonia Gandhi's 'death Dealers' statement about Modi
 Go sarkaar kaa kahana he ki sadhvi niranjan jyoti kaa bayaan galat tha, isiilie mangalvaar ko bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne khud apni ore se chetavanee de di thi
 Niranjan Jyoti then apologized for his statement in both the houses and withdrew the abuses
 iske baavjood vipaksh pradhanmantri ke bayaan or sadhvi ke istife ke liye ada rahaa
 Initiatives were taken by the government to remove the deadlock, and after talks with the top opposition ministers from the main opposition Congress, the government decided that the Prime Minister would make a statement in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, after which the proceedings of the House would go on
 tay samjhaute ke mutabik pradhanmantri ne bayaan diya, jisamen unhone na sirf niranjan jyoti ke bayaan ko galat tehraaya, balki yah bhi kaha ki unhone aise bayaan na dene kii naseehat di he
 But at the last moment the Congress reversed its promise and its mps did not allow the proceedings to go on with other opposition parties
 congress ke netaaon ke mutabik is palati kii do vajahen hai
 First, the rest of the opposition parties are insisting on the demand for resignation, so the Congress does not want to break the opposition unity
 duusari, congress kaa netritv bijepi ko aise kisi mudde par riyaayat dene ke khilaaf he, kyonki uske mutabik vipaksh main rahete hue bijepi ne bhi kai hafton tak sansad thap rakhi thi
 But the government is now ready to give the Sadhvi issue a second twist
 bijepi netaa bataate hai ki sadhvi jis nishad varg se aati hai, uskaa prabhaav ganga ke ilaake vaale purvi uttar pradesh se lekar bihar tak failaa he or is chunaav main modi ke naam par is varg ne bijepi kaa jabardast samarthan kiya
 Niranjan Jyoti is from Bundelkhand area
 vah nirdhan or pichde parivaar se hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party has been dominating in this area, but despite the apology, the manner in which Sadhvi is being targeted, reports of anger in Nishad, Mallah, etc
 are reaching Delhi
 yani agar vipaksh ise ek bada raajnneetik mudda bananaa chahta he to sarkaar bhi isamen peeche nahin rahegi
 Government managers allege that the speed with which the bills are being passed in Parliament, the opposition is nervous and that is why the issue of Sadhvi is being flouted
 sarkaar ne saaf kiya he ki vipaksh chaahe to agle do hafte tak sansad thap rakh saktaa he, magar aakhri vakt par sarkaar beemaa or pension bill paas karakar hi dam legi
 The government has also said that the GST bill will also be introduced in the Lok Sabha

 Speculations of forming a government in Maharashtra Tejasanjaya Raut reminded BJP that the government should be made under the '50-50 formula' The political riot continues in Maharashtra, there is a tussle between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party over the chief minister's post
 ab shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne ek baar phir bijepi ko gathbandhan dharm nibhaane kii yaad dilaai he
 Sanjay Raut said that the BJP should follow the 50-50 formula, which means an equal stake in the cabinet
 saath hi unhone ensipi ke saath jane kii atakalon par bhi apane pattey khole or kaha ki raajnneeti main vikalp khule rahete hai
 The Shiv Sena MP said that there were elections in two states, in Haryana, BJP has formed the government without majority
 unhone aise sanghathan se haath milaayaa he, jo unke khilaaf tha
 He said that if there is a delay in forming the government, then it is not our fault
 ensipi ke saath jane par sanjay raut ne kaha ki hamane abhi is par vichaar nahin kiya he, ye kaaphi jaldbaaji hogi
 However, he also said that everything is possible in politics, options are always open like you have seen in Haryana
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki chunaav se pehle vipaksh ko khatm karne kii baat ho rahi thi, lekin kya hua
 Shiv Sena will accept without CM post? Sanjay Raut said that it is necessary to follow the alliance, we are not hungry for power
 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle yahi tay ho gaya tha, jiskaa matlab cabinet post main baraabar kii hissedari he
 He said that why should we not get the chief minister's post for two and a half years, we all believe in Ram, then we should follow the policy of not going after life like Ram
 sarkaar banane par unhone kaha kibijapi ko 105 siton ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye koun roak rahaa he, agar aisa hota he to ye world record hoga
 Because the government requires a figure of 145
 agar koi loktantr kii hatya karnaa chahta he, to aise nahin chalegaa
 Let us tell you that the exercise to form a government in Maharashtra has started
 somvaar ko shivasena ke netaa or maharashtra ke siem devendra fadanvis se rajyapal se alag-alag mulaakaat kii thi, haalanki ise sirf diwali par saamaanya mulaakaat bataaya gaya

 Shiv Sena and BJP councilors clashed with each other during the BMC program in Mumbai
 is dauraan baithak main shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare bhi maujuud the
 Shiv Sena mps also raised slogans against PM Modi
 darasal, is baithak main ye bahes jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad biemasi ke advance chack ke upar shuru hui
 Since the debate, BJP councilors have raised slogans of modi-modi
 to vahiin shivasena parshad chor hai-chor hai, ghar-ghar chor hai ke naare lagane lage
 Shiv Sena councilor Kishori Padnekar has alleged that the BJP leader shouted that Bala Saheb is a thief
 lekin bijepi kii ore se is aarope ko khaarij kiya jayega
 At the same time, many BJP councilors left the meeting when Uddhav Thackeray was giving a speech
 aapako bataa den ki pichley kuch samay seshivsena or bijepimen tanaav chal rahaa he
 Recently, on the issue of agitation in Madhya Pradesh, the Shiv Sena had said in its editorial that Amit Shah was commenting on Mahatma Gandhi, while senior leaders of his party were using Gandhian methods to solve the problems of their state
 Huh
 haalanki haal hi mempiem modiki tarif bhi kii gai thi
 It has been written in the face that the way the state government negotiated with all the leaders of the opposition and other parties to find a way out for farmer loan waiver, it is praiseworthy
 kisaan sarkaar kii sadaiv rini rahenge
 However, in the editorial, the Chief Minister also criticized the Chief Minister for worrying about the burden of debt waiver on the state government
 china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing (xi Jinping) ke saath hone piem modi kii hone vaali 'anaupchaarik' mulaakaat ke baad na to koi bayaan jari honge or na hi kisi samjhaute par hastakshar honge lekin yah baithak kaaphi ahm he
 Before coming to India, the President of China (xi Jinping) met Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday
 jisamen unhone kaha tha ki kashmir main sthiti par china 'kareebi najar rakhe hue' he or 'yah baat spasht' he
 At the same time, he hoped that the 'allies' could resolve the matter through peaceful negotiations
 chini raashtrapati(xi Jinping) ne imran khan ko baithak ke dauraan bharosa dilaayaa ki antarrashtriya evam kshetreey halaat main badlaavon ke baavjood china or pakistan ke bich mitrataa atoot tathaa chattan kii tarah majboot he
 But India had given a strong statement on this statement of the President of China, stating that it is entirely an internal and sovereign matter of India and is attached to the Indian Constitution
 kisi bhi anya desh ko isse kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Ravish Kumar said, "india's stand remains firm and it is clear that Jammu and Kashmir is India's internal issue
 china hamaare paksh se acchhee tarah waakif he
 No other country has any right to comment on India's internal affairs
 ' iske saath hi unhone kaha ki 11-12 oktober ko hone vaale shi-modi (xi Jinping- PM Modi) kii baatcheet main kashmir or anuchhed 370 kaa maamla shaamil nahin he or agar shi maamle main or zyada jaananaa chahenge to unhen isaki vistrut jaankaree di jaaegi
 Similarly, on the sidelines of the G-20 summit held in France a few months ago, when the US President Donald Trump and PM Modi were to meet, the President of the US had raised the tone of mediation on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 unke is bayaan ke baad yah baithak kaaphi ahm ho gai thi lekin piem modi ne donald trump ke saath baithak main saaf kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir par bharat kisi bhi tisare paksh kaa hastkshep nahin chahta he
 It was also said that the removal of Article 370 is an internal matter of India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan 1947 se pehle saath the or unhen vishwaas he ki donon padosi apni samasyaon par charchaa kar unka samaadhaan kar sakate hai
 The PM rejected the scope of arbitration of any third party and said that both countries can discuss and resolve all issues
 haalanki mahabalipuram main piem modi or china ke raashtrapati ke saath hone vaali baithak main kashmir agenda main nahin he lekin chunki yah anaupchaarik mulaakaat he to ho saktaa he ki saamaanya baatcheet ke dauraan yah mudda uth jaae
 In such a situation, it will also be seen that the way the PM Modi had explained to the President of America, in the same way, the President of China will also be made aware of the issue of Jammu and Kashmir

 pradhanmantri narendra modi kedarnath va badrinath kii dharmik yatra par hai
 After doing Rudrabhishek in Kedarnath temple on Saturday, PM Modi meditated for 17 hours in the cave here
 iske baad ravivaar subah gupha se baahar aakar piem modi ne lanbaa rasta paidal tay kiya or gupha main apni sadhana ke bare main jaankaree saajha kii
 In this election environment, what Modi wished through this practice, when asked this question, PM Modi gave a very different answer
 piem modi se poocha gaya ki aapane jeet kii kaamana nahin kii, to is par modi ne kaha ki main jab bhagwaan ke charnon main aata hum to kabhi kuch maangata nahin hum
 i never ask for anything and i do not even agree with the tendency to ask because he (god) has made you worthy of not asking
 piem modi ne ye bhi kaha ki is dharti se meraa ek vishesh naata rahaa he
 Since yesterday, i went to the cave to live alone
 us gupha se 24 ghante baba darshan kiye ja sakate hai
 What happened in the present was i was out of it, in myself
 unhone kaha ki vikaas kaa meraa mishan, prakruti paryaavaran or paryaton
 What one can do to handle faith and devotion more, cannot increase spiritual consciousness but can prevent interruptions
 main video conferencing se kaam kaa jayja letaa rahata hum
 The PM said that hundreds of people have to work before the doors open, taking care of the convenience of common people
 main kabhi kuch maangata nahin, maangane kii pravriti se sahamat nahin hum
 God has made us unworthy to ask

 Chinese smartphone maker oneplus is set to launch a 5G smartphone this year
 haal hi main ye report ai he ki company jald hi oneplus 7T Pro launch kar rahi he
 But now this new report has created a confusion that the company will bring the oneplus 7T Pro with 5G or two new smartphones will be launched once again this year
 oneplus ke siio Pete Lau ne Financial Times se kaa he ki is saal kii chauthi timahi main company 5G capable nayaa divaais launch kiya jayega
 That is, from October to December, the company can launch 5G smartphones
 aapako bataa den ki mobile world congress ke dauraan barsilona main oneplus ne 5G smartphone kaa concept dakhaaya tha
 The company's objective was that people should know what are the advantages of 5G smartphones
 is baat se bhi inkaar nahin he ki oneplus 7T Pro main hi 5G kaa saport diya ja saktaa he
 It is being told that this time also two smartphones can be launched
 inamen se ek verient main Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chipset diya jayega
 Apart from 5G, what will be special in this smartphone is not clear at the moment
 dizin main zyada badlaav kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 Although new features can be given
 oneplus ke siio Pete Lau ne ye bhi kaha he, ‘hamen yakeen he ki agle saal 5G technolji ke development ke saath ham behatar parformens de sakate hai
 The 5G phase is coming and we will invest more in it
 oneplus TV kaa bhi elaan ho chukaa he or company ne tivi kaa logo jari kar diya he
 oneplus TV can also be seen in the market this year
 ab tak ham yahi sunate aae hai ki jab maamla pyaar kaa ho to lambaai, chamade kii rangath, ankhon kaa rang, baalo kaa rang, bhashaa vagairah se kuch fark nahin padataa
 But a recent study has proved this concept wrong
 is adhyayan ke mutabik mahilaayein stritv tathaa sangrakshan ke chalate lambey purushon kii taraf adhik aakarshith hoti hai
 Michael Emmerson, Elin and Gladys Kline, professors of sociology at Rice University in Texas, said that according to the theory of developmental psychology, equality plays the biggest factor in the choice of a human partner
 is adhyayan main die gaye aakadon ke anusaar kisi mahila ke lambey purush kii ore aakarshith hone ke peeche sangrakshan kii chaah or stritv kaa bhav kaam karata he
 The study quoted a woman as saying that being a girl, i like to feel fragile and secure at the same time
 apane premi kii nigaah main khud ko nicha sochate hue ajeeb lagata he
 The woman further said that i also want to take her in my arms and put my arms around her neck
 purushon ko haalanki lambaai ko lekar prem sambandh ke bare main kuch kehete kam hi suna gaya he or jo kehete bhi hai ve kam lambaai kii mahila ko hi praathamikta dete sune gaye hai
 However, he also does not want to fall in love with such a small woman, with whom he can not sit with the body
 uttari texas vishvavidhyalay ke samajashaastra ke praadhyaapak jorge yaansi ke anusaar ab tak aisa mana jaataa rahaa he ki lanbaa hona purushon ke vyaktitv main sakaaraatmakataa laata he, jabaki mahila lambii ho to uske liye yah kisi nijee jimmedaari kii tarah ho jaati he
 The study was published in the latest issue of the research journal 'family Issues'

 Kohli will become a batsman to complete 4,000 ODI runs in India as soon as he scores 30 runs in this sequence
 kohli ne 2018 main ab tak 10 maichon main 889 ran banaae hai
 If he is successful in scoring 111 runs, then he will achieve the feat of reaching the 1000 run mark in the year

 God bless u always Ever since the rift between India and Nepal related to the relationship between bread and daughter, Nepal's leaders are seen praising China
 kai maamalon main bharat ne nepal kii har sambhav madad kii, lekin kathmandu ke netaaon ko nai dilli kii bajaay beijing zyada acha lagane laga he
 Nepali Congress MP Vinod Chaudhary has started advising India that it will have to take along its neighbors
 arbapati kaarobaari auranepalicongress ke saansad vinod choudhary bharat daure par hai or aaj tak ke saath exclusive baatcheet ke dauraan unhone kaha ki pichley dinon main hue raajnneetik ghatnakram ke chalate donon deshon ke bich kuch galatchhemiyaan paidaa hui hai
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Nepali Congress MP Vinod Chaudhary said, "the distances between India and Nepal have not come suddenly
 bharat or nepal ke bich roti-beti kaa sambandh rahaa he
 The relationship between India and Nepal ranged from trade to cultural level, but it did not remain consensual
 "donon deshon ke bich rishte main achaanak kyon ai ke jawaab main nepali saansad kaa kahana he ki jab rishte majboot honge to usamen bahut sari apekshaayen or ummiden bhi hoti hai, khaskar aise desh ke saath jo majboot he, sakasham he or jiske paas saare saadhan maujuud hai
 Nepal has been through many bad times continuously
 khud nepali saansad kaa bhi kahana he ki lagbhag 12 saal nepal main bandookdhaari vidrohiyon ne asthirataa machaai
 What changed from Modi's visit to Nepal? Nepali parliamentarian Vinod Chaudhary told Aaj Tak that when Prime Minister Modi visited Nepal, the whole of Nepal was impressed with him after his speech within 40 minutes of Parliament and the streets in Nepal But every Modi and every house started shouting Modi's slogans
 vinod choudhary kehete hai ki pradhanmantri ke us bhaashan ne puure nepal kaa mood badal diya tha
 The Nepalese leader alleges that during the ongoing Madheshi movement in Nepal, India blocked and supplied Nepal to Nepal, due to which the relationship between the two countries grew bitter
 vinod choudhary ne kaha, " madheshi andolan ke dauraan madheshi muddon ko jis tarah se uchhaala gaya, uske naam par jo blocade nepal par kiya gaya vah bhi tab jab nepal main bukamp jaisaa itnaa bada haadasa hua tha, jisamen lagbhag 7 lakh ghar barbaad ho gaye the
 "why question Madheshi's right to fight? Why did Madheshi's movement try to discredit India by spreading false propaganda while Madheshi wanted his right to Nepal's constitution in his movement? Vinod Chaudhary's answer was that recently Look at the elections held in Nepal
 chunaav ko bharat ne bhi sweekaar kiya or nepal ke 7 rajyon main sirf ek rajya main aadha pratishat jeet madheshiyon ko mili he
 Whatever representation is made in the country, he gets rights accordingly
 nepali sansad kaa aarope he ki madheshi andolan ke dauraan bharat ne madheshiyon ke liye jo rukh apanaaya vah ek badi vajah thi, jisase donon deshon ke bich rishte main kadavaahat bad gai or jo blocade kii sthiti bani, usase nepaliyon kaa man tut gaya
 Why is China glorified? On becoming close to China, Nepali MP Vinod Chaudhary replied that the road should be open with every country
 bharat ke saath 1800 kilometre kii simaaen judi he
 But if China gives us the transit corridor, opens the way for trade and connects Nepal with railway links and gives us another option during our troubles then there is nothing wrong
 "haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki donon deshon ke saath rishton kii tulana nahin kii ja sakati kyonki bharat kaa apana sthaan he or china kaa apana sthaan
 However, he says that the relationship with India has its own importance
 pradhanmantri modi ke daure ke baad bharat ke videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj bhi teen baar nepal gai he or nae chune gaepradhanmantrijld hi bharat ke daure par bhi aaenge
 At the same time, the Nepali MP did not miss out on saying that his self-respect is the greatest for any independent nation
 kya nepal china ke propaganda kaa shikaar ho rahaa he?is sawaal ke jawaab main nepali saansad kaa kahana he yah propaganda kii baat nahin he kyonki china out of da box jaakar nepal kii madad nahin kar rahaa he
 China has its own contribution in the development of Nepal, be it geographical or cultural
 china nepal main vikaas ke bade bade project kar rahaa he or ek belt ek road pariyojna ke tahat use jod rahaa he
 It is also very important for Nepal
 vinod choudhary kaa kahana he ki china jis tarah nepal main paisa laga rahaa he bade-bade transit road bana rahaa he, nepal ke liye bahut jaruri he
 On why Nepal is praised? The Nepali MP said that it is not that we just believe in balanced relationships
 vinod choudhary kaa kahana he ki bharat ko nepal ke centement ko samajhnaa hoga
 The sentiments of the Nepalese and the desire for Nepal's development have to be understood and met
 bharat par aarope lagaate hue nepali sansad kaa kahana he ki 25 saalon main jab bhi nepal main nai sarkaar banati he tab bharat kaa naam aata he, koi sarkaar girti he tab bhi bharat kaa naam aata he
 Now just saying that it did not work for Nepal from India - did it
 nepali saansad kaa kahana he ki duniya ke sabase teesri badhati hui arthvyavastha vaale desh bharat ko sab power house kehete hai or aise main uske saath lage hue chote deshon ke saath roti-beti kaa sambandh rahaa ho, unki ummiden bad jaati hai ki wo bhi bharat ke saath aage bade
 Nepali mps are advising India that it will have to take along all its neighbors like Nepal
 pashchim bengal ke lalgarh main haalat bekaabu hote ja rahe hai
 On Wednesday morning, 3 people of the resistance committee were killed in the forests of Lodhasuli near Lalgarh
 is ghatana ke baad ilaake main kaaphi tanaav he
 The tribals will not allow the paramilitary forces to enter
 By the second evening, five company paramilitary forces will reach Lalgarh
 puure ilaake se police camp hataa liye gaye hai or adivaasiyon ne puure ilaake ko kabje main le liya he
 The tribals say that they will not allow the paramilitary forces to enter
 kai dinon se jari he sangharshadivaasiyon or sipiem ke bich pichley kai dinon se sangharsh chal rahaa he or puure episod main prashasan mookadarshak bana dikh rahaa he
 Tribals are targeting the offices and houses of CPM people and they are occupied by the roads
 adivasee to maano puri tarah ladai ke mood main dikh rahe hai or pashchimi midanapur kaa lalgarh jang ke maidan kii tarah nazar aa rahaa he
 As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, there is no less of trouble for them
 team se lekar srilanka cricket board main chizein thik nahin he jisase phans kii bhi naaraazgi bad rahi he
 Rangana Herath will not play in the third Test due to backache
 tej gendbaaz nuwan pradeep hemestring ke chalate series se baahar hue
 Asela Gunaratne has already dropped out of the series
 aise main viraat ke paas mauka he vah karne kaa jo pehle koi bhartiya team nahin kar saki
 If Sri Lanka could even draw a match with this team India, it would be a mental victory for them
 jahaan tak baat srilanka kii he to unke liye pareshaani kam nahin ho rahi
 Things are not right from the team to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, which is also increasing the displeasure of the fans
 peeth main takaleef ke chalate rangana herath tisare test main nahin khelenge
 Fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep dropped out of the series due to hamstring
 asela gunaratne pehle hi series se baahar ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, Virat has the opportunity to do what no Indian team could do before
 srilanka agar is team india ke saath match drow bhi kar saki to ye unke liye maansik jeet hogi
 India Today's special show 'inspiration' by Captain Kohli, in his talk, Virat Kohli has said that there is an agenda going on continuously trolling Ravi Shastri
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya coach is dharna se sabase kam prabhavit hai ki vah captain kii haa main haa milaate hai
 Kohli said Shastri faced the fast bowlers with 'courage' without a 'helmet' and scored at an average of 41 as an opener, which is a tough response to critics of the current coach
 kohli ne india today ko uske vishesh sho ‘inspireshan’ par kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki inamen se adhikansh chijen agenda se prabhavit hai or mujhe nahin pataa ki koi aisa kyon or kis liye kar rahaa he lekin is tarah se jhooth ko sweekaar karnaa agenda se prabhavit he
 'he said,' Luckily in the case of Ravi Bhai, he is someone who does not care about these things at all
 ’ baayen haath ke spinner ke rup main aagaaj karne vaale shastri ne baad main bharat ke liye pari kaa aagaaj bhi kiya or 1985 vishwa siries cricket main unhen ‘champion of champiens’ kaa pratishthit puraskaar bhi mila, mukhya coach kaa samarthan karte hue kohli ne ye sabhi tark rakhe
 This is what the trollers said - Kohli gave a message to the trolls saying, 'tenth was sent as an opener and as an opener he scored at an average of 41
 vah kisi aise vyakti se pareshaan nahin hone vaale jo ghar main baithkar unki troling kar rahaa ho kyonki agar aap unki jaisi uplabdhi hasil karne vaale vyakti kii troling karnaa chaahate hai to chaliye phir un gendbaajon kaa saamana kiijie, jo unhone kiya he vah kiijie, aisa karne ke liye hausala chahie, iske baad unke saath bahes kiijie,’haal main test siries main bangladesh ko raundne ke baad kohli ne apane tej gendbaaji akraman ko ‘swapnil sangyojan’ qaraar diya jo kisi bhi sataha par kisi bhi tarah ke virdohi ko dhwast karne main sakasham he
 This was done in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah
 captain ne kaha ki kaaphi adhik pratispardhaa ke baavjood tej gendbaajon ke bich sauhaard he or bilkul bhi asuraksha nahin he
 Politics has intensified in Delhi on the statement of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by Sanjay Singh on the bjp's statement on the BJP, the statement made on the Biharis
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli ke aspataalon main bahari marijon ke lekar ek udhaaharan diya, jisapar bhartiya janata party agbabula ho gai
 Now BJP has been hit by the Aam Aadmi Party
 AAP netaa sanjay singh ne is masale par kaha ki BJP vaale roj utapataang mudde laate hai, majaak kii baat ye he ki jo party bihar or UP ke logon kii hatya karwaati he wo achaanak purvaanchaliyon kii chintaa kar rahi he
 Sanjay Singh said that the Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi is leaderless and now the issue has become pointless
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ne saamaanya bayaan diya he ki dilli kii vyavastha behatar he isliye log baahar se ilaaj karaane ke liye aate hai
 Sanjay Singh said that where is the treatment being received from Ayushman Yojana? 'health is excellent in Delhi' Aam Aadmi Party leader said while targeting the BJP that it is wrong to criticize without making any headway
 unhone kaha ki dilli main behtareen health vyavastha he, arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party bihariyon ke sammaan ke liye khadi he
 Assembly elections are going to be held in Delhi next year, so the verbal war between AAP and BJP is going on
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bacchon kii maut hui wo sabhi ne dekha, jahaan par bijepi ke mukhyamantri hai
 He alleged that in order to divert attention from the issue of floods in Bihar, this issue is being flouted
 # watchdelhi CM: One person from Bihar buys a ticket to Delhi for Rs 500, returns after availing free treatment worth Rs 5 lakhs

 com / qw1hvrypnk — ANI (@ANI) September 30, 2019 What was the statement of Arvind Kejriwal? Actually, on Sunday, CM Kejriwal had praised Delhi's health system at an event
 isi dauraan unhone kaha tha ki 'bihar kaa ek aadmi 500 rupee ke tikat se train main baithkar dilli main aata he or 5 lakh kaa ilaaj free main karvaa kar chalaa jaataa he
 It gives happiness that there are people of our country, everyone should be treated
 lekin dilli kii apni kshamta he, puure desh ke logon kaa kaise ilaaj karegi, isliye jarurat he ki saare desh main swasthya suvidhaayen sudhare

 sheetakaaleen satr main teen talaak bill paas karwaane ke liye sarkaar ke paas aaj aakhri mauka he, dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki sarkaar aaj apane is prayaas main kaamyaab ho paati he yaa nahin
 On the basis of majority in the Lok Sabha, the government easily passed the bill, but in the Rajya Sabha, the government is in the minority and it needs the help of the opposition parties to pass the bill, whose Congress did not say anything about the bill in the Lok Sabha, now the same in the Rajya Sabha Showing strength and demanding to send the bill to the Select Committee along with other parties
 sarkaar kii ore se kaha ja rahaa he ki bill ko select cameti (pravar samiti) ke paas nahin bheja ja saktaa kyonki supreme court ne teen talaak ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit kar rakhaa he or court ke jajon ne chah maheene ke liye teen talaak par roak lagaai thi or wo avadhi 22 farvari ko puri ho rahi he
 While the opposition says that the period of 6 months will be considered from the date of passing the bill
 sarkaar ke samiti se darane kii vajahakhir vipaksh muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak-2017 bill ko jis pravar samiti ke paas bhejne kii maang kar rahi he usase sarkaar itani dari kyon hai or vahaan bheje jane se kyon batch rahi he?sansadamein 2 tarah kii kamitiyon yani sansadeey samitiyaan kaam karti hai jinka gathan sarkari kaamkaaj par prabhavi niyantran banaae rakhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Parliamentary committees are of two types, ad hoc and permanent
 tadarth samiti kaa gathan kisi khaas maamle yaa uddeshy ke liye kiya jaataa he, uskaa astitv tabhi tak kaayam rahata he, jab tak vah is maamle main apana kaam puraa kar report sadan ko saunp nahin de
 While the work of the standing committee is fixed
 lok lekha samiti, prakkalan samiti, visheshadhikaar samiti or sarkari aashwaasan samiti jaisi kai tarah kii sthaayee samitiyaan hoti hai
 There are 24 types of Departmentally based Standing Committees consisting of 21 Lok Sabha and 10 Rajya Sabha members
 har samiti main sadasyon kii sankhya alag-alag hoti he
 Apart from this, there are other types of standing committees
 pravar samiti or sanyukt samiti ke rup main tadarth samiti do prakaar kii hoti hai, in donon hi samitiyon kaa kaary sadan main pesh bill (vidheyakon) par vichaar karnaa hota he, lekin jaruri nahin ki sadan kii ore se in donon samitiyon ke paas sabhi vidheyakon par vichaar ke liye bheja hi jaae
 The Select Committee takes all matters of the bill sent seriously
 vichaar ke baad samiti kisi bhi maamle par apane suzav de sakati he
 This committee can seek their opinion from organizations, experts and others related to the bill
 bill par gahan vichaar-vimarsh ke baad pravar samiti apane sanshodhano or sujhaavon ke saath sadan ko report saunpti he
 If a member of the committee disagrees with the bill concerned, his disagreement may also be sent along with the report
 sarkaar ko maaloom he ki pravar samiti main vipaksh haaavee rahegaa or uski ore se jo sanshodhan die jaaenge use manwaane par bhi jor degi
 If the government accepts the Rajya Sabha amendments, then the bill will have to be sent to the Lok Sabha again
 aise main bill kaa jald paas hone kii sambhaavna jaati rahegi, jabaki supreme court kii ore yah miyaad 22 farvari ko khatm ho rahi he
 The bill must be passed in both the houses
 If the bill related to triple talaq remains adamant about being sent to the Opposition Select Committee, the government will not be able to get it passed in the current winter session of Parliament
 vaise bhi sheet satr main aaj aakhri din he
 For any bill to take the form of law, it is necessary to pass it from both the houses
 28 disambar ko loksabhaa main yah bill pesh kiya gaya jo 7 ghante tak chali lambii bahes ke baad paas ho gaya tha
 Several amendments were also introduced after the debate, but all were rejected in the House

 unhone hairat jataate hue sawaal kiya ki kya america ke raashtrapati bhi khud ko jorge washington bataa denge? tushaar gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti ko bhavy tareeke se manaane kii sarkaar kii yojana ‘maatr sankethik' he
 Trump last week praised Modi, saying, "I remember India was very divided earlier
" kaaphi asantosh tha, ladaai thi or unhone (modi) sabko ekajute kiya
 As a father does
 ho saktaa he vah raashtra ke pita hon
 Reacting to the US President's statement on September 24, Tusshar Gandhi said, "those who want a new Father of the Nation are welcome
" trump yah bhi chahenge ki jorge washington (sanyukt rajya america ke sansthaapakon main se ek) kii jagah khud ko rakh len
 Tushar Gandhi, 59, is the son of journalist Arun Gandhi, grandson of Manilal Gandhi and great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi
 bharat main dakshin panth ke ek dhade dwaara nathuram godse kaa gaurav gaan karne ke bare main puche jane par tushaar gandhi ne kaha, ‘‘samay is baat kaa akalan karegaa ki kya acha he
 "he said," Those who worship hatred and violence can praise Godse
 unhen lekar mujhe koi shikaayat nahin he
 This is their right as it is my right to worship Bapu
 main unka swaagat karata hum
 On the government's plan to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi with pomp, Tusshar Gandhi said that such celebrations are merely symbolic
 unhone kaha, ‘‘baapu ke vichaar or vichaardhaara har jagah lagu ho sakate hai- jivan or prashasan samaan rup se, lekin dukhad he ki aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 "tusshar Gandhi said," Bapu has been reduced to mere signs like posters of currency notes and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 '' unhone kaha ki samaaj ko samajhnaa chahie ki mahatma gandhi kii vichaardhaara samay se pare he or duniya bhar main jan andolanon ko prerit kiya he
 He said that there is "continuity" in Gandhiji's ideology and its acceptance is increasing throughout the world at a time when intolerance and extremist ideologies are becoming stronger

 org / Haryana Minister Anil Vij, who is in the news due to his statements, has once again targeted Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 anil vij ne kaha ki puraa desh ummid kar rahaa tha ki rahul gandhi nani ke ghar jaaenge to buddhi lekar aaenge, lekin lagata he wo vahaan se khaali haath laute hai
 He said that it seems that his mind has not recovered even after going to Nani's house
 anil vij ne ye jawaab haal hi main rahul gandhi ke dwaara amarnath yatra ke dauraan hue aatanki hamale par sawaal uthaane par diya
 Hindustan ummeed kar rha tha ki naani ghar jaayega buddhi le ke aayega, lekin lagta hai wahan se khaali haath aa gya: Anil Vijpic

 com / ofcvwhfxjd — ANI (@ani_news) July 14, 2017 What did Rahul say? Let me tell you that on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi wrote via Twitter that PM Modi's policies made room for terrorists in Kashmir, causing great damage to the country Has happened
 rahul ne likhaa ki thode samay ke raajnneetik phaayde ke liye piem modi ne pidipi se gathbandhan kiya, jo desh kii suraksha par baari padaa
 He wrote that the personal gain of Prime Minister Narendra Modi caused a strategic loss to the country and innocent people lost their lives
 yah pehali baar nahin he ki anil vij apane bayaan ke kaaran charchaa main hon, isse pehle bhi wo kai baar surkhiyaan bator chuke hai
 Anil Vij's controversial list of words: Controversial statement about Gandhi cap (07 October 2016) Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij, who was in the news for his statements, said in October last year that Congress leaders should now see the traditional Gandhi cap
 Should wear helmet instead of wearing
 vij ne yah tippanee congress ke ek kaarykram main purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or haryana pradesh congress adhyaksh ashok tanvar ke samarthakon ke bich hue khooni sangharsh ke baad kii thi
 Tanwar and some others were injured in the conflict, they had to be hospitalized
 apni sarkaar ko bhi nahin choda (22 farvari 2016)haryana main jat andolan ke baad anil vij ke ek bayaan se party ke saamne nai chunauti khadi ho gai thi
 Anil Vij had said in a threatening manner that he would resign if compensation was given to the people who died in the Jat reservation violence
 apane bebaak vichaaron ke liye mashhoor haryana ke swasthya evam khel mantri anil vij, krishi mantri o pi dhanakad ke us twit se naaraaz the, jisamen hinsa main marane vaale prayek vyakti ko 10 lakh rupee kaa muaavja or uske ghar ke ek sadsy ko sarkari naukari dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 The uproar caused by Anil Vij's statement on beef (12 February 2016) The uproar was triggered by another statement by Haryana minister Anil Vij in February last year
 unhone kaha tha ki jo log gomance ke bina jinda nahin rah sakate, unhen haryana nahin aana chahie
 Vij's statement came after Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's statement that there is no dispute over the ban on beef in the state
 haryana main saal 2015 main lagu hue ek kanoon ke mutabik rajya main gomance kii bikri nahin kii ja sakati
 When Anil Vij (27 November 2015) clashed with a woman officer, Haryana Health and Sports Minister Anil Vij, who was in dispute, shouted at a senior woman police officer during a meeting in November 2015
 unhone afasar se kaha 'get out'
 The police officer refused to leave the meeting and Vij himself got annoyed and had to leave the meeting
 darasal fatehabad main sharaab kii taskari maamle ko lekar afasar or mantri ke bich kii bahes main naubat yahaan tak pahunch gai thi
 Vij asked Fatehabad Superintendent of Police IPS Sangeeta Kalia to leave the meeting
 sangeeta ke manaa karne par vij gusse main baithak se chale gaye
 When Vij told Sangeeta 'get out', Sangeeta said, 'I will not go
 aap is tarah se meraa apmaan nahin kar sakate
 ' big bos ke ghar main hivoltage drama chaalu he
 Till now, there was a war between Shilpa Shinde and Vikas Gupta
 ab sho main sapana choudhary or arshi khan ke bich katfite dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Arshi said to dance Sapna
 jiske baad sapana apana aapa kho baithi or unhen markar aspataal bhejne kii dhamkee de daali
 Actually, there was a conversation between the contestants at home
 tabhi arshi ne kaha ki hiten mujhe apni rani banayega or hamaari shaadi bhi hogi
 Sapna said on this, it is right that those who cannot be married in real, it is better to be in fake
 is par arshi ne kaha, to kya jagah-jagah naachne waalon kii shaadi hogi
 What was just then, Sapna became so angry with Arshi's comment that she decided to harass Arshi
 big bos main phir jane ko taiyaar he jubair khan, padhein uski shartsapana ne kaha, arshi ne mujhe naachne vaali kaha, ab to ise main hospital pahunchaakar rahuungi
 Arshi accuses Sapna of threatening to kill her

 Since then, the discussion has continued between them

 In which Sapna lived
 rahi-sahi kasar raja-rani task main puri ho gai
 Where Hiten became king, Sapna asked to suppress Queen Arshi's feet
 ghar main is masale par khub hangaamaa hua
 Sapna refuses to press Arshi's leg
 lekin hiten ke kehane par unhone task puraa kiya
 Seeing the circumstances of Bigg Boss house, it seems that the entire house has become a Sultani Arena
 arshi hameshaa se hi apane shabdon kii vajah se gharavaalon kaa nishaanaa bani rahati hai
 Everyone instructs them to talk properly and not to quarrel
 lekin lagata he sapana ko isse fark nahin padataa
 In the weekend episode of the episode, host Salman Khan also told Arshi not to use wrong words

 He said that if you want to know the history of our party, then go to the tomb of your grandmother Indira Gandhi and ask her
 AIMIM ke mukhiya asaduddin ovaisi ke chote bhai or vidhayak akbaruddin ovaisi ne nampalli main road sho ke dauraan kaha ki hamaari party kaa itihaas jaanane ke liye rahul gandhi ko apni daadi indira gandhi kii samadhi par janaa chahie or unase poochna chahie ki vah 1984 main darussalaam kyon ai thim

 While a coalition of four parties against the KCR by name Prajakutmi is in the fray
 bijepi ke piem in vatting or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke kareebi amit shah ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav main modi kahaan se chunaav ladenge ye abhi tay nahin he
 Amit Shah made it clear that the Ram temple issue is not on the bjp's agenda
 aaj tak ke saath exclusive baatcheet main upi main bijepi ke prabharee or gujarat ke purv grih mantri amit shah ne kaha, 'narendra modi kahaan se chunaav ladenge yah ab tay nahin he
 The party will decide this
 ' jab unase poocha gaya ki kya ve khud upi main kismat aajamaayenge to unhone kaha ki ye baad kii baat he abhi to unka puraa dhyaan prachaar main he
 Amit Shah said that Ram temple issue is not on bjp's agenda
 amit shah se baatcheet kii he hamaare editor-at-large rahul kanwal ne
 Excerpts from the conversation with him: You did politics in Gujarat throughout your life, you were given such a big responsibility because of Narendra Modi, the country's largest state, the most complex state, its in charge
 longon ne yah sochaa ki kya amit shah vaaki main upi kii raajnneeti itani jaldi samaj paaenge
 
 
 Gujarat has bipolar politics, will you be able to understand the complex politics of UP so soon? Amit Shah - Look, it will be known only when the results of elections are out
 lekin mujhe bharosa he, party ne jis vishwaas se mujhe ye jimmedaari saunpi he, us vishwaas se main bilkul damakham se paar utarunga or sabase badi party banakar ham uttar pradesh main waapas aaenge
 Why was you given such a big responsibility, what is the relationship between you and Modi that you are considered to be right hand of Modi? Amit Shah - Look two questions are different
 kyon di gai ye to aap rajnath singh ji se puchhie or party ke bade netaaon se puuchhie
 It is my job to give responsibility to the party, whatever capacity i have within me, i will carry on using the ability properly
 or jahaan tak modi ji kaa sawaal he to modi ji kaa koi khasmkhas nahin he, jo zyada kaam karte hai wo unhen achche lagate hai
 And naturally the more work one does, the more chance he gets
 aap sidhi baat kiijie
 It should be straightforward, do not say that you are not special to them
 puraa desh aapako is vakt dekh rahaa he, sab jaanate hai modi ko, amit shah ko bhi or desh ke raajnneeti ko bhi
 Tell me what is your strategy of conquering Uttar Pradesh? Amit Shah - See, it is not a big deal this time to conquer Uttar Pradesh
 iske teen kaaran hai- pehla kaaran, upie sarkaar ke khilaaf badi anti inkambency kii lahar puure uttar predesh main he, manhagaai or bhrashtachar, desh kii suraksha or lachar prashasan
 If people are upset with this, then the mood to change the government is created in the same way
 doosraa kaaran he ki jo uttar predesh kii sarkaar he, iske khilaaf bhi anti inkambency puure peak par he or sapa va basapa donon ke kushasan se log trast hai
 People remember bsp's misrule even today, sp's misrule is still going on and people have no choice other than BJP
 agar centre main sarkaar badalani he to na sapa badal sakati he, na basapa badal sakati he, sirf bijepi badal sakati he or is baar parivartan kii lahar desh bhar main agar sabase zyada he to wo uttar pradesh main he
 But the assumption is that Amit Shah has been sent to Uttar Pradesh for this reason so that there will be Hindu polarization
 jameen par, sataha ke neeche amit shah yah massej bhej rahe hai ki kis tarah se musalamaanon kaa episment ho rahaa he, hinduon ko jodne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Is this Amit Shah's strategy to add Hindus in the name of Modi? Amit Shah - Look, i am working directly for the organization, but the people of UP, the people who are in the government, have made such people that i think Elections will be communalized as they come
 21 mukademe jo hardkor techriston ke khilaaf agal-alag samay main daayar kiye the, or wo log jail main hai, unhen jail main se chodene ki sifarish is sarkaar nen kii he
 i can never think, what kind of step can the government run under the constitution take
 roj-roj ke kaam or vikaas ke kaamon main bhi episment ke kaaran, bahumat kii sankhya jo he ve hindu he, usamen badi naaraazgi prashasan ke prati he
 i don't need to do anything, Mulayam has done the job of making Hindus angry in the course of doing Muslim appearances
 aap kah rahe hai, mulaayam kii sarkaar, akhilesh kii sarkaar chizon ko polaraise kar rahi he
 But we saw in the riots of Muzaffarnagar, your MLA was Sangeet Som who was circulating fake clips of lies to create a feeling against the minority community
 koun kar rahaa tha yah kaam, aapke party kaa tha?amit shah -ye police kaa varjan he, ek baar is maamle ko cart main jane dijie
 Not once did Sangeet Som say that he did not? Amit Shah - Let this matter go to court, let the debate take place, you will all know that this is a fake case
 or aap sirf clip ko kyon dekh rahe hai, jo ghatana ghati us par turant ection kyon nahin liya prashasan nen, agar turant ection liye jate to turant wo baat vahiin dab gai thi
 Why the reaction came, the reaction came because the administration took unilateral action
 jab ek badi sankhya ke man main aisa bhav khadaa hota he ki prashasan ekatarfa kaarywahi karata he, anyaay ho rahaa he to logon main gussa ubalana swabhaavik he
 If there was no one-sided action then nothing had to happen there
 desh bhar main is tarah kii ghatnaayen ghatati hai, lekin uttar pradesh ke alaava kahin kuch nahin hota he
 Because the police do their work, they neither see caste nor religion
 magar uttar pradesh main police aaj dharm dekhakar kaam kar rahi he, iske kaaran polarigeshan hua he
 But it seems that a double game is going on in Uttar Pradesh at this time
 ek taraf narendra modi hai jo kehete hai ki shauchalay pehle aana chahie, devalayas baad main
 On the other side you are, you go, the first thing you did is that you went to Ayodhya, you said that the Ram temple will be built here
 vinay katiyaar kanpur ke manch par khadey hokar bolte hai ki hindutv, ram mandir kaa mudda he chunaav main
 Other BJP leaders are very quiet, so what is the game going on? hidutv ke naam pe, ram mandir ke naam pe
 Explain clearly that Ram temple is on your agenda or not? Amit Shah - See, our national president has repeatedly made it clear to the media that Ram temple is not our election agenda
 mujhe lagata he iske baad bhi media ke alaava or koi ye nahin kah rahaa ki ram mandir hamaare agenda main he
 You first went to Ayodhya and first you said that we all have this feeling and will build the Ram temple here? Amit Shah - You either did not listen to me properly, or you are presenting it incorrectly
 maine kaha tha ki maine ram bhagwaan ke saamne prarthana kii he ki desh kushasan se mukt ho, congress mukt bharat bane or yahaan sabaki sahmati se bada ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho, aisi maine prarthana kii he
 Neither did the BJP talk, nor did it say anything about the election agenda
 jahaan tak meri prarthana kaa sawaal he, wo meraa adhikaar he or main aaj bhi kahata hum ki ram lalaa ke saamne maine aisi prarthana kii thi ki sabaki sahmati se sabake sahyog se vahaan ek bhavy ram mandir bane or ram lalaa ek acchhee jagah par, ek bhavy jagah par viraajen
 You said that Ram temple is not an election issue for you, then how important is Hindutva, especially in Uttar Pradesh, for Amit Shah, for Narendra Modi? Amit Shah - see my party policy is to not approve of anyone, everyone Do justice with isamen do baat hai, kisi kaa episment na karnaa or sabake saath nyaay karnaa
 If there is an appointment in this, then automatically the feelings of the other end emerge
 isko main nahin roak saktaa, iske liye agar koi doshi he to episment karne vaala he
 You are also blown away by that feeling
 amit shah – tool dene kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 BJP will reflect the public sentiment, give voice to it
 janabhaawanaaon ko aawaaj dena ham logon kaa kaam he, or kisi ke saath bhi anyaay hoga, meri baat ko thik se samajhiega, kisi ke saath bhi anyaay hoga to bijepi usko mukhar hokar uthaaegi?aapane mere sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya
 What is the role of Hindutva in your election
 amit shah – sarkaar ke dwaara jo episment ho rahaa he
 The feelings of leaving him are hurting and he came to the surface
 isamen kisi ne uksaaya he, is tarah kii baat nahin he
 The action that the government has is provoking the emotions of the other end
 vahi ection or riection vaali baat he
 Amit Shah - The government's action has caused a reaction at the other end and Bhavana has reacted to the surface
 aapaki ek ranniti he ki narendra modi ko ati pichhadaa netaa ke taur par project karen or kahen ki pehla mauka he jab koi ati pichhadaa desh kaa pradhanmantri bane, isliye jo pichde hai wo bhi narendra modi ko vot den
 i spoke to some senior leaders who are your opponents, they say that no one becomes an OBC leader in the name of caste or in the name of caste, what Narendra Modi has done so far in his career, based on which people feel that really Do i have any leader who is OBC? Amit Shah - See BJP is not projecting Modi as a leader of any class
 magar wo baat sahi he ki modi ji ati pichhadaa varg se aate hai
 Second thing you said that Modi ji did nothing
 main ek baat aapako daawey ke saath kahata hum ki modi ji ke 12 saal ke shashan main gujarat main obisi sabase zyada sukhi he, mali taur par, shiksha ki baat main or unka empowerment – teenon chizon main agar obisi kahin par sukh se hai to main bejhijak kah saktaa hum ki wo gujarat main hai
 And this 12 years have been under Modi's rule
 to modi ne kuch nahin kiya obisi ke liye ye baat sahi nahin he
 In Modi's rule, obcs have come forward in Gujarat in a big way, they have empowered
 or jahaan tak uttar pradesh kaa sawaal he, obisi aaj teenon partiyon se bahut naaraaz hai kyonki dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kii baat teenon partinyaan karti hai or dharm aadhaarit aarakshan agar aata he to 50 pratishat kii jo cap lagi he uske kaaran essi / asti kaa to kuch nahin jayega, kyonki wo samvidhan sangrakshit baat he or jo aarakshan kam hoga wo obisi kaa hi hoga
 You are causing fear again
 amit shah – nahin khauf paidaa nahin kar rahaa hum, vaastaviktaa bataa rahaa hum
 i have never claimed that 18 percent reservation will be given to minorities
 meri party iske khilaaf he
 It is not a constitution to give reservation to any particular religion
 phir bhi partiyaan vot ke laalach main isko oochaal rahi hai
 Its reaction is definitely in OBC
 obisi naaraaz hai ki hamaare munh kaa niwala chhinakar minerities ko dene kii baat kii ja rahi he
 There is a lot of doubt among Muslims about Narendra Modi
 aapke hisaab se agar narendra modi pradhanmantri banate hai to unka minerity se rishta kaisaa hoga
 Amit Shah - Modi is no foreign element to power
 modi ji teraa saal se gujarat main satta main hai
 And there is no challenge and in the report of the commission that the Government of India has implemented, (I am talking about the Sachar Commission), according to that report, if Muslims are happier than most, then that state is Gujarat
 minerity kaa jahaan tak sawaal he, jab puure state main bijli jaati he to minerity ke ghar bhi bijli jaaegi
 If roads are built in the entire state, then people of the minorities also use it, if the education of the entire state is upgraded, then it will be used for the children of the minority as well
 minerity or memaurity ke chakkar se baahar nikal jaaiye, ye era hindustan main khatm ho chukaa he
 On the basis of development, the whole of India is going to vote
 par hakeekat yah he ki muslim polarigeshan is vakt ho rahaa he
 In the name of Modi, other parties are creating fear and there is apprehension among Muslims, there is concern about Modi
 to modi kyon nahin thodaa rich out karte hai
 Many people said that if they apologize wholeheartedly for the 2002 riots, then perhaps the concern among Muslims will be removed from their hearts about Modi? Amit Shah - leave the responsibility of reducing the concern of Muslims to us Give koi musalmaan naaraaz nahin he, na khaufjada he, vipakshi partiyaan iskaa jitna prachaar karengi, utana hi unka nuksaan hoga
 As we can see, symbolism has become enough
 hamane kaaphi reliyon se pehle dekha ki bijepi kii taraf se ek notice niklaa ki aap topi pahan kar aaiye, aap sherwani pahan kar aaiye
 What is needed to show this amit shah – ye sab media kii baat he
 No, we have a letter
 hamane mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ko dikhalaayaa ki bijepi minerity kamity ke letters hai jisamen ye kaha ki agar aap raily ke liye aaen to aap koshish kiijie
 Amit Shah - See, this letter is either fake, or it may have been done in private by a worker below
 party ne na to aisi koi soochna di he na party kii ore se aisa koi praytn hua he
 You say that you are against symbolism and then you say come wearing a hat
 amit shah – main bilkul dinai karnaa chahta hum party kii ore se aisa koi praytn nahin hua
 Someone in the party must have done it privately
 magar main adhikrut rup se isko dinai karata hum, party ne aisa koi praytn nahin kiya, na kabhi karegi
 According to you, how much Amit Shah's departure in UP has made a difference, how much your condition has improved
 aaj agar chunaav hote hai to bijepi ko kitni siten milengi
 Amit Shah - Amit Shah's departure has not made any difference
 narendra modi ke naam par bahut bada fark he
 Because the things that anti-incumbency generated, people are looking for answers to all those things in Modi
 main siton ke andaaj par janaa nahin chaahunga
 Election is late
 pratyaashee bhi sabhi partiyon ke ghoshit nahin hue hai
 But i can say with much confidence that BJP is going to be the largest party in UP
 upi kii koun si seat se narendra modi chunaav ladenge
 Amit Shah - Where has Narendra Modi contested the election has not been decided yet
 modi ne kabhi apni seat apane aap tay nahin kii he
 This party will decide
 aap loge chalange
 You will fight UP amit shah – meraa ladanaa, na ladanaa bahut der kii baat he
 Right now i have to fix up's organization
 itane saare bijepi main sharsh netaa hai
 Many come from UP
 to ye jimmedaari aap hi ko kyon di gai
 Why was the biggest challenge given to Amit Shah? Amit Shah - i thought too much, but i have a plurality of times, i think nothing more
 chaliye, jahaan ek taraf amit shah uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main sakriy hai vahiin ek ore amit shah kaa ek itihaas bhi he
 a history in which you have a charge sheet
 aap par bahut sangeen mukademen hai
 It is being discussed that in the second Ishrat charge sheet you can have a name
 aapako chintaa he kariyar kii?amit shah - dekhie, chintaa mujhe jaraa bhi nahin he kyonki main nahin maanata ki mere kaaran upi kaa kaam rukegaa
 There are millions of workers in UP
 sabane ek saath milakar ek maahaul banaaya he or ab ise koi roak nahin saktaa
 As far as the charges against me are concerned, this fake charge sheet has been filed against me by the CBI, before that no lawsuit was ever filed against me in my 49 years of life
 ye pehali chargeshit hui he, wo bhi ek ankanutor kii hui he, ek anti-neshnal ke ankanutor kii hui he
 And i claim from the claim that this is a fake charge sheet and the High Court has also accepted that there is no primafacy case, so my bail has been given and the Supreme Court has also accepted the same fact that no primafaisi case is made
 abhi to aapako sirf bel mili he
 If there is a charge sheet, the court will have to decide separately
 
 
 amit shah - bel ke jajment ke andar likhaa he ki sibiai ke loyr koi primafasai cese court ke saamne nahin rakh sake, isliye ham bel dete hai
 You know DG Banjara very well
 aapke saath unhone bahut dinon tak kaam kiya he
 He wrote a letter, in which he wrote that whatever was the policy of fake encounter, all of Gujarat were aware of Amit Shah
 amit shah - dekhie do baaten hai, ek to banjaaraa ne apni chitthee main likhaa hi nahin ki ye phek ankanutors the
 He has written Encounters
 or jahaan tak policy kaa sawaal tha, gujarat sarkaar kii policy websit par rakhi hui he
 Available at every police station
 har pulicekarmi siarpisi ke hisaab se kaam kare ye gujarat sarkaar ki policy he
 Now you said your point
 aap grahamantri the, banjaaraa ankanutor specialist the
 When Banjara Encounter Specialist was no more and these things came out, did lashkar-e-taiba stop targeting Narendra Modi after that? Amit Shah - You don't know, even then there is a thirsty perception
 iske baad bhi isi tarah ke ibi input aae
 After this, even today, Central IB is sending Threat Perception
 aaj bhi deshbhar main lashkar ho yaa koi bhi jihadi sanghathan uskaa sabase bada nishaanaa koi agar he to wo narendra modi hai

 We will unite and contest elections
 aap dekhiegaa, netaa tay hone ke baad aapako koi divide nahin dikhegaa

 The absence of Nitish Kumar at the luncheon party organized by the Congress President to show solidarity to the opposition after three years of Modi government has become a topic of discussion on Friday
 uske baad piem modi ke kaarykram main shirkat karne ke unke faisle ke baad raajnneetik charchaaen tej ho gai hai
 Actually this is happening at a time when the Congress is exploring the possibilities of a grand alliance with the opposition parties in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Nitish Kumar had announced a few days ago that the current Modi government should take initiative to build consensus on the presidential election
 or shuukravaar ko baithak main bhi is aashay kaa prastaav paarit kiya gaya

 The present Prime Minister is of Bihar origin

 Although political experts believe that if Nitish did not go to Sonia Gandhi's banquet on Friday, then he must have had his own idea and he has agreed to go to the Prime Minister's banquet within 24 hours, then he must have some strategy behind it too may have been
 lekin ghotaale ke aaropon main ghire apane sahyogi lalu yadav ke saath filhal wo kisi saarvajanik manch par nahin aana chaahate

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi uske baad nitish kumaar dwaara bihar main sharabbandi kii ghoshnaa ke kadam kii saraahna kii thi
 However, after the cabinet meeting in Patna, Nitish said that people are unnecessarily misinterpreting not attending Friday's banquet while he told Congress General Secretary Ahmed Patel five days ago that the former national from his party President Sharad Yadav will join and give his opinion on the issues discussed in the meeting organized by Congress President Sonia Gandhi Minister was
 nitish kumaar ne kuch dinon purv hi ye ghoshnaa kar di thi ki raashtrapati chunaav par vartmaan modi sarkaar ko aam sahmati banane ke liye pahal kerani chahie
 And a resolution to this effect was also passed in the meeting on Friday
 lekin nitish ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke sabhi faisle kaa wo aadar karte hai
 But after lunch on Saturday, Nitish Kumar admitted that he has separately sought time from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the problem of silt in the Ganges and he has been informed that the meeting will take place after the banquet on Saturday
 nitish ne kaha ki is baithak main unke saath bihar ke mukhya sachiv anjani kumaar singh bhi maujuud rahenge
 Clearing the agenda of this meeting, Nitish said that he is worried about the silt of the river Ganges
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar jis ganga kii aviralata kii baat kar rahi he wo ganga main gaad ke jamaa hone tak sambhav nahin
 Nitish wants the Center to once again send a team to inspect the site to study the problem

 lekin morishas ke saath bihar kaa bhaavnaatamak lagaav he
 Bihar is the origin of 52 percent of its population
 abhi ke pradhanmantri bihar mul ke hai
 On this occasion, Nitish said that he is going to this background
 haalanki rajintik jaankaar maanate hai ki shuukravaar ko agar sonia gandhi ke bhoj main nitish nahin gaye to uske peeche unka apana koi vichaar rahaa hoga or pradhanmantri ke bhoj main 24 ghante ke andar jane ke liye unhone sahmati di he to uske peeche bhi unki koi ranneeti jarur rahi hogi
 But at the moment he does not want to come on any public platform with his colleague Lalu Yadav surrounded in the scam charges
 nitish kumaar haalia varshon main piem narendra modi ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi rahe hai or jab narendra modi ko 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle party kaa piem pad ke liye cheharaa banaaya gaya to nitish kumaar ne takreeban do dashak puraane apni party ke gathbandhan ko bijepi ke saath samaapt kar diya tha
 However, in recent times there is some warmth from both sides
 isaki baangi is baat se samajhi ja sakati he ki jab pichley saal notebandi kii ghoshnaa hui thi to sabhi dalon ne piem modi ke is faisle kii aalochana kii thi lekin nitish kumaar ne us kadam kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also then praised the move by Nitish Kumar to declare liquor ban in Bihar

 Pandit Ravi Shankar, the 'bharat Ratna' sitar player, was jealous of his wife Annapurna Devi as she played the 'better than him' sitar and surbahar
 lekin apni shaadi bachaane ke liye annapurna devi ko apane hunar kaa galaa ghontna padaa
 This is revealed by Annapurna Devi herself
 sirf kismat waalon ko annapurna devi ke sitar ko sunne kaa mauka mila he
 He has finally broken the silence and told that only to save his marriage, he ended his bright career and got lost in the darkness of oblivion
 annapurna devi ne angreji akhbaar 'da times of india' ko die intervyuu main yah daawa kiya he
 He said, 'when both of us presented a program together in a show in the 1950s, people as well as critics would praise me more
 panditji ko yah acha nahin lagata tha
 One had to choose between marriage and career, he said, adding that it had a negative impact on his married life
 annapurna ke mutabik ravishankar ne kabhi unhen kaarykram pesh karne se roka to nahin, lekin vah duusare tareekon se yah jataa dete the ki apni patni ko khud se zyada tarif milane se vah khush nahin hai
 Annapurna told that after this, situations arose that she was forced to choose one of her marital life and career and she chose the family
 unhone bataaya ki vah bahut kam bolne waalon or parivaar ko praathamikta dene waalon main se thim
 According to him, he was more concerned about saving his marriage than earning a name
 ustad allaudin kii beti hai annapurnahalanki, unki tamaam koshishon ke baavjood bhi vah aakhirkaar apni shaadi ko bachaa nahin pain
 He told that his father Ustad Alauddin Khan did not want their marriage to be broken and for this reason Annapurna did all that he could to save it

 Annapurna married her student Rishikumar Pandya, who died in April 2013, after his separation from Ravi Shankar

 The entire country has received more than normal rainfall on most days of July
 ab mausam vibhaag ko ummid he ki barish is saal bhi saamaanya ke str tak pahunch sakati he
 Because good rains are likely in many parts of the country for the next five days
 agar june kii barish ko dekhen to yah saamaanya se 35 fisadi kam thi
 But by the end of July, this shortfall has remained only 11 percent
 isse krishi kshetra ko bhi phayda hoga
 Transplanting of crops has also reached the same level as last year
 bhartiya mausam vibhaag (IMD) ke anusaar desh ke do-tihaai hisson main saamaanya yaa usase adhik barish hui he
 By the beginning of July, only 23 per cent of the country had received adequate rainfall

 The planting of crops this year was 26 per cent less than the month of July last year till the beginning of July, but the decrease was reduced to 6 by the end of July
 4% aa gai he
 It is expected that by the end of the season, planting will be done at par with the previous year
 kyonki desh ke alag-alag hisson main mausam acchhee barish hone laayak ban rahaa he
 According to the Meteorological Department, there has been good rainfall in Central India i
e
 Gujarat, Odisha and Maharashtra
 yahaan barish saamaanya se sirf saat fisadi kam he, jabaki uttar or uttar-pashchim bharat main 10 fisadi kaa antar bachaa he

 US President Barack Obama strongly defended the construction of the mosque near Ground Zero on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the 9 / 11 attack, asking why not a mosque if a Hindu temple can be built

 'he said that America believes in its citizens having the freedom to follow their religion

 If you can build a Hindu temple somewhere, then you should have the ability to build a mosque there

 Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir suddenly went on TV for 15 seconds on February 25, 2010 when he dismissed the dossier handed by India on Hafiz Saeed and its terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba as "mere literature"
 Had given
 baat bahut karine se or kaayade se kahi gai thi, lekin uskaa mazaakia lahaza spasht tha
 Bashir arrived in Delhi on 20 June as Pakistan's High Commissioner
 yah unki saahitiyik shabdaawalee kaa inaam he yaa phir jarur islamabad main koi behad mazaakia shaks baitha faisle le rahaa he
 However, Bashir, who has a fine identity of literature, must understand the good and the bad
 darasal, dilli main unke daftar main jo pehali file pahunchi he vah saiyad jabiuddin ansaari kii he-bid kaa rahane vaala vah bhartiya naagarik jo hafiz said kaa khasmkhas tha, jisane 26 november, 2008 ko mumbai ke hamalaavaron ko prashikshan diya tha or karachi ke ek control room main baithkar teen din tak lashkar ke aatankiyon dwaara machaai gai tabaahi kaa sanchaalan kiya tha
 There is only one person who knows the difference between reality and story: Ajmal Kasab
 mumbai kii jail se report ai he ki jab use ansaari kii giraftaar kaa pataa chalaa, to vah soch main dub gaya
 Ansari is not stubborn
 usase raaj ugalvaane ke liye police ko bahut pratadna nahin deni padi
 He has happily poured everything out
 america main david hedli kii padtaal ho yaa dilli main ansaari kii, har jagah ek hi baat nikal kar saamne ai haih pakistan kii iesai kaa hamale main bada haath tha
 After the opening of Ansari's mouth, now Bashir's "literature" has taken the shape of the entire library
 unki dikkat samajhi ja sakati he
 In Pakistan, the bureaucrats do not get paid so that they continue to blame the ISI, if this happens then all the ministers will lose their jobs immediately
 yaa to unhen inkaar karnaa hota he, yaa phir maamle ko doosraa mode dena padataa he
 Denial is fine, but turning the case may be in different directions
 masalan, kashmir kaa maamla, jo barason ke istemaal ke baad ab ghis chukaa he
 Nowadays a new excuse has started, "we are also victims of terrorism
 '' upar se to yah baat apil karti he, lekin isamen gaharaai nahin
 This method is an attempt to become a Baggir of India by sweeping the blame from the shoulder
 yadi pakistan khud shikaar he, to uski sarkaar hafiz said ko kyon bachaa rahi he?saudi arab ne vah kiya he jo karne se pakistan ne inkaar kar diya thah 26 / 11 ke pahachaane ja chuke shadyantrkariyon ke khilaaf karrwai
 Ansari's arrest is as dramatic and decisive for the Indian subcontinent as was Osama bin Laden's death for America
 islamabad main baithi sarkaar is prakaran ke baad bhi apana purana adiyal ravaiya apanaae hue he, lekin parade ke peeche to use dard kaa ehsaas ho hi rahaa hoga, kyonki 'sahitya' kaa yah taaja adhyay riyaad main likhaa gaya he
 The question arises, why did Saudi Arabia decide to cooperate with India on an issue that is the foundation of the relationship between India and Pakistan? Ansari went on a fake Pakistani passport in Saudi Arabia in the name of Riyasat Ali
 use puraa bharosa tha ki saudi arab bhi pakistan kii hi tarah surakshit he kyonki uske sir par iesai kaa haath tha
 The things Ansari has told the Indian police must have been spewed out before the Saudi police handed him over to India
 saudi jaanate the ki ansaari ''major ikbaal'' or ''major samir ali'' jaise iesai ke afasaron kaa naam legaa
 The Saudi government knew that by handing Ansari over to India, it was also drawing the last mask from the face of the extremely intelligence operation conducted by Pakistan
 saudi arab ne aisa sirf isliye nahin kiya kyonki ansaari bharat kaa dushman he, balki isliye kyonki vah ek aisi baat jaanata he jise pakistan kabhi sweekaar nahin karegaah ki ansaari saudi arab kaa bhi dushman he
 Ansari hates India or spreads religious fanaticism by misinterpreting Islam, this will not go down on the Saudi people or their ruler King Abdullah, who is himself the patron of the two mosques (harmen Sharifen) of Mecca and Medina
 agar saboot chahie, to yahi is baat kaa saboot he ki bharat virdohi aatankwaad ko islam ke sarvocch almbaradaaron kii manjuuri hasil nahin he
 King Abdullah's decision will not immediately translate into formal diplomacy, although it will dramatically change strategic perceptions and create a stir in the movements below the surface
 riyaad aage bhi pakistan kaa dost bana rahegaa, lekin vah aatank ke khilaaf jang main dilli kaa sahyogi ban chukaa he

 - Input IANS CBI ne kolkata ke purv police ayukta rajeev kumaar (rajiv Kumar) ko sarada chitfund ghotaale ke silsile main poochtacha ke liye shanivaar ko pesh hone ke liye saman bheja he
 Officials gave this information on Friday
 agency ne yah saman kalakatta ucch nyaayalay kii ore se shuukravaar ko unki giraftaar par lagi roak hataane ke baad bheja
 Officials said that the team of CBI officials reached Kumar's house to give summons
 maujuuda samay main atirikt police mahanideshak (CID) ke pad par karyrat kumaar us vishesh jaanch dal (SIT) kaa hissaa the jise rajya sarkaar ne anya chitfund maamalon ke saath hi is ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye banaaya tha
 However, the Supreme Court had handed over the case to the CBI in 2014
 sarada group of companyj ne lakhon logon ko kathith taur par nivesh par oonche ritern kaa vaada kar unhen 2,500 karod rupye kaa chuunaa lagaaya tha

 kendriya soochna ayog (siaisi) ne dilli nagar nigam (emsidi) ke janasuchana adhikari ko soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat mili aavedan par galat soochna muhaiyaa karaane par latad lagaai he

 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat subhash chandra agarwal ne emsidi se yamuna nadi ke tat par sthit nigambodh ghat par kathith taur par bhedbhaavpurn tareeke se up-vishisht logon ke liye shavadah chabutare banaae jane ke sambandh main jaankaree maangi thi, jiske chaaron ore gril lagi hui he
 Agarwal claims that the grill has been installed around these crematoriums so that cremation of selected people can be performed here
 janasuchana adhikari or pratham apiliy praadhikaran ke jawaab se asantusht agarwal ne siaisi kii ore rukh kiya
 Aggarwal asked the CIC to draw attention to the fact that a discriminatory attitude towards cremation was being done at Nigambodh Ghat on the banks of river Yamuna
 is kram main siaisi ne mana ki loktantr main sabhi logon ko samanta kaa haq he or agar kisi saarvajanik praadhikaran dwaara aise prachlan ko badhaava diya jaataa he to yah shame kaa vishay he
 What is shocking is that in the information sought by Aggarwal, the MCD has described crematoriums made for sub-specific people dating back to 25 years, on the other hand, according to DDA, the construction of these crematoriums made for sub-specific people , Was done in the year 2006
 didie ne kaha he ki usne up vishisht logon ke dah sanskaar ke liye aise kisi chabutare kaa nirmaan nahin kiya he
 In fact, in this regard, when DDA officials visited Nigambodh Ghat on the banks of river Yamuna on July 3, it was found that three crematorium platforms have been temporarily grilled
 aise main agarwal ne aarope lagaaya ki prashasan ne up-vishisht logon ke shavadah ke liye aisa kiya he
 The CIC said that according to the evidence presented, the MCD Public Information Officer provided the wrong information to Agarwal
 aise main siaisi ne emsidi ke janasuchana adhikari ko saman jari kar poocha he ki kyon na unke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaae or jurmaana lagaaya jaae
