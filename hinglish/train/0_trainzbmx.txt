 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye
 Well, today my mind is very distressed due to these incidents, especially due to natural calamities, but in the midst of it, with patience, with confidence, you will also take the country forward, any person of this country
 
 
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit ho, vanchit ho, adivasee ho, gaanv kaa ho, garib ho, kisaan ho, chota vyapaaree ho, koi bhi ho, har ek ke kalyaan ke maarg par, ham sankalp ke saath aage badhate rahenge

 tippaniyan Thank you
 pichley dinon do mahatvapurn kaam karne kaa mujhe avasar mila
 We are celebrating the year of 125th birth anniversary of Pujya Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 kai varshon se mumbai main unke smarak banane kaa jameen kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 i am satisfied today that the Government of India has decided to give that land for the memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar
 usee prakaar se dilli main baba sahib ambedkar ke naam se ek international centre bane, puraa vishwa is manishi ko jane, unke vichaaron ko jane, unke kaam ko jane
 This too was a subject hanging for years, completed it, laid the foundation stone, and resolved to complete the work which had not been done for 20 years in 20 months
 or saath-saath mere man main ek vichaar bhi aayaa he or ham lage hai, aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch parivaar hai jinako sar pe mailaa dhone ke liye majaboor hona padataa he
 Does it suit us that even today some families in our country have to carry scum on the head? i have said with great urge in the government that in the year of 125th birth anniversary remembering the virtue of Babasaheb Ambedkar, we can get rid of this stigma
 ab hamaare desh main kisi garib ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade, ye paristhati ham sahan nahin karenge
 Society should also be supported
 sarkaar ne bhi apana daayitv nibhaana chaiye
 i also need the support of the public, we have to do this work
 baba sahib ambedkar jivan bhar shikshit bano ye kehete rahete the
 Even today, education has not yet reached many of our Dalit, oppressed, exploited, deprived society, especially among daughters
 baba sahib ambedkar ke 125 veen jainti ke parv par, ham bhi sankalp karen
 In our village, in the city, in the locality, the daughter or son of the poorest of the poor should not remain illiterate
 sarkaar apana karttavya kare, samaaj kaa usamen saath mili to ham zarur santosh kii anubhuti karte hai
 i feel like sharing a pleasure and an agony
 mujhe is baat kaa garv hota he ki bharat kii do betiyon ne desh ke naam ko raushan kiya
 One daughter Saina Nehwal became number one in the world in badminton, and the other daughter Sania Mirza became number one in the world in tennis doubles
 donon ko badhai, or desh kii sari betiyon ko bhi badhai
 Proud of their efforts and might
 lekin kabhi-kabhi ham bhi aapa kho baithte hai
 When the cricket World Cup was going on and we lost to Australia in the semi-finals, the kind words that some people used for our players, which behaved, my countrymen, is not good
 aisa kaisaa khel ho jisamen kabhi paraajay hi na ho are jai or paraajay to jindagi ke hisse hote hai
 If the players of our country have ever lost, they should be encouraged in times of crisis
 unka nayaa vishwaas paidaa karne kaa maahaul bananaa chaiye
 i am confident that from the future we will learn from the defeat and will not get entangled in the action and reaction in a moment by losing balance in the things which are associated with the honor of the country
 or mujhe kabhi-kabhi chintaa ho rahi he
 Whenever i see that something happens suddenly, a crowd gathers and burns the car
 or ham tivi par in chizon ko dekhte bhi hai
 Should not be an accident sarkaar ne bhi har prakaar kii koshish kerani chaiye
 But tell my countrymen that by expressing anger in this way, we burn the truck, burn the car
 
 
 
 Dead does not come back kya ham apane man ke bhaavon ko santulit rakhke kanoon ko kanoon kaa kaam nahin karne de sakate hai? sochna chaiye

 My greetings to all of you
 tippaniyan Thank you
 kya hamen shobhaa detaa he ki aaj bhi hamaare desh main kuch pariwaron ko sar par mailaa dhonaa pade? maine sarkaar main bade aagrah se kaha he ki baba sahib ambedkar ji ke punya samaran karte hue 125 veen jainti ke varsh main, ham is kalank se mukti paaen
 Now in our country, any poor has to carry scum on the head, we will not bear this situation
 samaaj kaa bhi saath chaiye
 The government should also fulfill its obligation
 mujhe janata kaa bhi sahyog chaiye, is kaam ko hamen karnaa he
 Baba Saheb Ambedkar used to say to be educated throughout his life
 aaj bhi hamaare kai dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit samaaj main, khaas karke betiyon main, shiksha abhi pahaunchi nahin he
 On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, let us also resolve
 hamaare gaanv main, nagar main, mohalle main garib se garib kii beti yaa betaa, anpadh na rahe
 If the government does its duty, if the society gets along with it, then we definitely feel satisfaction
 mujhe ek anand kii baat share karne kaa man karata he or ek pidaa bhi bataane kaa man karata he
 i feel proud that two daughters of India brightened the name of the country
 ek beti saina nehwal badminton main duniya main number ek bani, or duusari beti sania mirza tennis dubles main duniya main number ek bani
 Congratulations to both, and also to all the daughters of the country
 garv hota he apano ke purusharth or parakram ko lekar ke
 But sometimes we also lose temper
 jab cricket kaa world cap chal rahaa tha or semi-final main ham australia se haar gaye, kuch logon ne hamaare khilaadiyon ke liye jis prakaar ke shabdon kaa prayog kiya, jo vyavhaar kiya, mere deshavaasiyo, ye acha nahin he
 What should be the game in which there is no defeat, Jai and defeat are part of life
 agar hamaare desh ke khilaadi kabhi haar gaye hai to sankat kii ghadi main unka hausala buland karnaa chaiye
 An atmosphere should be created to create their new faith
 mujhe vishwaas he aage se ham paraajay se bhi seekhenge or desh ke sammaan ke saath jo baaten judi hui hai, usamen pal bhar main hi santulan kho karke, kriya-pratikriya main nahin ulajh jaayenge
 And I'm worried sometimes
 main jab kabhi dekhtaa hum ki kahin aksmaat ho gaya, to bheed ikatthi hoti he or gaadi ko jala detii he
 And we also see these things on TV
 accident nahin hona chaiye
 The government should also make every effort
 lekin mere deshavaasiyo bataaiye ki is prakaar se gussa prakat karke ham trek ko jala den, gaadi ko jala den
 
 
 
 mara hua to waapas aata nahin he
 Can we not allow the law to work as a law by keeping our feelings of mind balanced? Should think khayr, aaj meraa man in ghatnaon ke kaaran bada vyathit he, khaas karke prakritik aapadaaon ke kaaran, lekin iske bich bhi dhairya ke saath, aatmavishvaas ke saath desh ko bhi aage le jaayenge, is desh kaa koi bhi vyakti
 
 
 Be it Dalit, victim, exploited, deprived, tribal, village, poor, farmer, small businessman, anyone, on the path of welfare of everyone, we will keep moving forward with determination
 vidhyaarthiyon kii parikshaayen purna hui hai, khaas kar ke 10 veen or 12 veen ke vidhyaarthiyon ne chuttee manaane ke kaarykram banaae honge, meri aap sabko shubhakamanaayen hai
 Your vacation is very good, you have an opportunity to learn something new in life, to learn new, and you have worked hard throughout the year, then it is my wish to spend some moments with family with enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 aap sabko meraa namaskara

 Katju is known for his sarcastic comments on social media

 He wrote, 'A country with a sick economy like Croatia has elected a beautiful woman Graber Kitarovic as president

 The BJP is not willing to give up its claim on one of these seats

 "the 55-year-old Mehbooba Mufti, the head of the Peoples Democratic Party (PPP), was very clear that now she was not ready to step back
 mahabuuba ke bare main mana jaataa he ki parde ke peeche mahatvapurn nirnay unheen ke hote hai
 Mehbooba, who played a key role in the very delicate decision to form a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir by crossing the political boundaries of his brother-in-law and Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mukrat Mohammad Sayeed, believes that this will not only benefit his constituents in the Kashmir Valley
 Rather, the benefits of the marginalized people of Jammu and Ladakh will also be benefited
 jab said ne jammu-kashmir main shantipurna chunaav kaa shrey pakistan or aatankwaadiyon ko diya or haal hi main 7 march ko jab mukchaymantri ne hurriyat ke algaavvaadi masarrat alam kii rihaai kaa vivadaspad aadesh diya to sara desh ubal padaa tha
 This controversial statement and decision of the state government, from top to bottom in BJP - from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to party workers of Jammu, Kishtwar, Doda and Bhaderwah - had become a source of panic
 haalanki mahabuuba kahati hai ki unhen iskaa koi ''pachhtaawaa nahin, '' or saaf karti hai ki alam ke maamle main unke walid ne to mahaj supreme court ke aadesh ko lagu karavaaya he
 Responding to the critics, she says, "you tell me, Supreme Court verdict does not apply in Jammu and Kashmir?" Mehbooba knows his work well despite not being as experienced as 79-year-old Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 
 siyasat ke utaar-chadhaav se do-chaar hone ke baad, khaskar umr abdulla ke netritv vaali neshnal conference or congress kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke chah saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan ve raajnneeti ke daanv-pech acchhee tarah sikh chuki hai
 She has also learned how important it is to raise voices from time to time for political gains
 apni aawaaj paryaapt oonchi karte hue mahabuuba kahati hai, ''yah mufti sahab or modi ji, pidipi or bijepi kaa masalaa nahin he, yah jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa he
 In her tone, she calls for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on the lines of South Africa, which will "initiate incidents such as the killing of innocents at the hands of terrorists in the name of reconciliation in Kashmir, including fake encounters
" ''yah jaanate hue ki kashmir masalaa uthaae jane ke andeshe bhar se hi congress or neshnal conference samet gathbandhan kii unki sahyogi bijepi bhi tilamila jaaegi, ve is masale se jude sabhi pakshakaron ko ek saath ek manch par laane kii vakaalat karti hai
 Mehbooba says the PDP and BJP alliance is a "partnership", aware of how deep the differences between the two parties are
 mahabuuba kaa maananaa he ki 1947 main hari singh ke shasankaal se hi kashmir jis andhere kune main fansaa hua he, usamen se use bachaa nikaalane kii kuwwat unki gathbandhan sarkaar main hi he
 Mehbooba says that due to the contradictions between the PDP and the BJP, a new understanding of Kashmir will develop and it will give a new direction to the valley
 ''desh kii samprabhutaa sarvopari hoti he,'' is baat par jor dete hue ve kahati hai, ''in virodhabhaason kaa khulkar saamne aana acchhee baat he
 On this pretext, the country is at least getting to know that Kashmir has a separate constitution and a separate flag
 '' unke mutabik, kashmir yaa pidipi koi bhi is sachaai ko chhipaana nahin chahta
 Staying PDP-BJP alliance will be good for the large youth population of the valley
 dilon par maraham lagane or khud ko shalag-thalgy maanane kii dashak bhar puraani maansikta se kashmiriyon ko aazaadee dene ke alaava mahabuuba ne yuvaaon ke liye or jagah banane kii vakaalat shuru kar di he
 She says, "we want to have many coffee houses, libraries, places in the valley where young people can talk freely, spend time
" ''saptaah ke ant main jammu ke wave mal main saikadon kii sankhya main yuva jodon ko sukun se vakt bitaate dekha ja saktaa he
 If she is able to do what Mehbooba is saying, everything will change in the valley

 Regarding the match, he said that India missed the opportunity to control for the second consecutive day
 unhone kaha, hamane pehle din unke 124 par aath wicket kar diye the or ham chaar wicket par 267 ran se dhwast ho gaye

 ab match donon tiimon ke liye khulaa he
 Dravid said, we would like to chase small scores

 Suddenly she turned red in anger
 har koi sakate main tha
 This form of Congress President Sonia Gandhi was first seen
 sansad main pehali barbat agast 2012 kii he
 The monsoon session of Parliament was going on
 lok sabha main bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa ek bayaan sonia ko behad nagavar gujara
 Sonia, usually seen as calm and smiling, took an aggressive stance
 peeche mudin or phir kya tha, sonia kii lalkaar par congress saansadon ne shor machaate hue ek saath hamalaa bol diya
 Ultimately, Advani ended the case by apologizing
 sadak par bhi pehali bartin saal baad sonia gandhi ek baar phir usee jujhaaru mudra main sakriy najar aa rahi hai
 On the first Dandi March, i
e
 March 12, he marched from Congress headquarters to the bungalow of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with mps
 uske baad usee tareeke se puure vipaksh ko ekajute kar sansad bhawan se raashtrapati bhawan tak march kiya
 Sonia was looking for a chance against the Modi government at the Center
 jaise hi bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke rup main sonia ko ye mauka haath laga sonia gandhi sakriy ho gayi
 By the way, the opposition leaders who had seen the unity on the way to Rashtrapati Bhavan had not been seen for a long time
 rahul gandhi chuttee par hai
 The first news came that in April, Rahul Gandhi could be handed over the post of Congress President
 phir maaloom hua ki maamla tal gaya he
 Perhaps that's why Sonia has become quite active once again
 lok sabha chunaav main baari shikast ke saath hi jarurat bhar siten na milane se lok sabha main vipaksh kaa netaa pad bhi jaataa rahaa
 Now, by uniting the opposition on the issue of farmer interests, Sonia has given a strong fight to the government
 jis tarah desh ke liye majboot sarkaar jaruri he usee tarah lok tantra ke liye ek majboot vipaksh bhi jaruri he
 Sonia is following the same path

 Prabhat Khabar has written that the most nota was used in central Howrah

 Like Bengal, about eight and a half lakh voters did not give NOTA in Tamil Nadu, but here also 5,57,888 voters have pressed NOTA

 mangalvaar ko sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru hote hi mayawati achaanak siyaasi parde par aakar chaa gayi
 BSP supremo Mayawati stands to speak in the Rajya Sabha on the issue of Saharanpur, the Speaker stops her from speaking
 sansad main roj aisa najaara dekhne ko miltaa he
 But the situation became something else here
 mayawati ke tevar achaanak talkh hote hai or ye kehete hue ve sadan se baahar chali jaati hai ki jab ve apni baat nahin rakh sakati to rajyasabha kii sadsyta kaa kya matlab
 She declares that she will resign today and then resigns by evening
 kya scrypted tha ye puraa maamla?vipaksh kaa aarope he ki ye puraa maamla bas charchaa main aane ke liye tha or scrypted tha
 Mayawati resigns for three pages and raises political issues from Saharanpur to it
 jabaki niyam ye he ki koi sadsy sansad se istipha dete vakt bas ek line kaa istipha degaa or koi kaaran nahin batayega
 On this basis, the Chairman is unlikely to accept these resignations
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii koshishon ke bich somvaar ko najaara ekadam badal gaya
 The Congress supported Mayawati and then all the Congress mps walked out
 is puure mudde par vipaksh golband dikh rahaa he
 Mayawati and the opposition see 5 major political benefits from this masterstroke
 1
 The seat of Rajya Sabha was confirmed and in May 2018, the term of Mayawati's Rajya Sabha membership was being completed
 loksabhaa main bispi kaa koi sadsy nahin he or upi vidhansabha main sirf 19 sadasyon ke vot se mayawati ke liye rajyasabha phir se pahunch paanaa sambhav nahin tha
 But now the Congress stands in support after the resignation and RJD Chief Lalu Yadav has offered to send Mayawati from RJD quota to Rajya Sabha
 is tarah vipakshi ekajutata ke bich mayawati kii rajyasabha main vaapasi ke kai vikalp khadey ho gaye hai
 2
 upi main siyaasi jameen phir se hasil karne kaa majboot aadharasagaranpur main daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar kaa mudda uthaate hue mayawati ne istipha de diya
 In this way, Mayawati again came into the discussion among her core vote bank Dalits
 pichley do chunaav mayawati ke liye kaaphi bure parinaam vaale rahe the
 The bsp's account could not even be opened in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main basapa 80 se ghatakar sirf 19 siton par aa gai
 Mayawati and Akhilesh have announced to come together after the election
 ab mayawati phir se upi main apni khoi hui siyaasi jameen taiyaar karne kii taiyaari main hai or ye siyaasi masterstroke sabit ho saktaa he
 3
 dalit mudde par vipaksh golband, modi kii badi chunautisaharanpur mudde ko rajyasabha main uthaakar mayawati daliton ke mudde ko phir se agenda main laane main safal rahi hai
 This may increase the challenge for the BJP, surrounded by the first Vemula case, then Saharanpur
 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke pehle congress samet tamaam vipakshi dal dalit votbank ke maddenjar mayawati ko aage rakhkar modi ke liye chunauti badha sakate hai
 4
 2019 ke liye rashtriya mahagathbandhan ke concept ko centre main laa diyarashtrapati chunaav main nitish ke alag kheme ke saath khadey hone se 2019 se pehle rashtriya mahagathbandhan banane kii vipaksh kii koshishon ko jhatka laga tha lekin mayawati ne phir se vipakshi ekta kii sambhaavnaaon ko jinda kar diya he
 All the opposition parties are seen united against the BJP and now the exercise of the grand alliance can move forward again
 5
 In preparation for the situation of Lalu's predicament, the CBI and ED raids of the members of the Lalu family were done in advance
 isse lalu family ghir gai
 Lalu termed it as an act of shutting down the voice against the BJP
 lekin mayawati ne pehle se hi modi sarkaar ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh ke saath dikhaa diya he ki agar unpar koi karrwai hoti he to ise badale kii siyasat kehane kaa unke paas mauka hoga
 Significantly, Mayawati is already facing investigations in several cases including disproportionate assets case, Taj Corridor
 aise main agar jaanch agenciyaan phir se karrwai karti hai to vipakshi ke saath ve bhi aawaaj buland kar sakati hai
 The general election is knocking 2019 and the constituents of the NDA, sitting silent for the last four years, are becoming vocal
 vahiin soshal media par ek dance aajkal jabardast tareeke se lokapriy ho rahaa he
 From Facebook to whatsapp, everyone is going crazy about Uncle ji's dance
 padhein shuukravaar shaam kii 5 badi khabaren

 In the bargain mood, the NDA constituents are showing each other one by one the tough stance? The general election 2019 is knocking and the NDA constituents who have been sitting silent for the last four years are becoming vocal
 abhi mangalvaar ko hi endie ke pramukh ghatak dal lok janashakti party ke ramvilas paswan ne desh kii saamaajik sthiti par bayaan dete hue kaha ki vah na to maujuuda samay main bijepi ke bandhua majdoor hai or na hi vah pehle kabhi lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ke saath gathbandhan ke vakt bandhua majdoor the

 These three trial formulas got the opposition to outperform the BJP and win the opposition
 bijepi ke khilaaf 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh inhen formule par mahagathbandhan banaakar chunavi samar main utarataa he, to modi ke liye satta bachaae rakhana mushkil ho jayega

 Porivartan (parivartan) has made a comeback in Bengal after eight years
 aath saal pehle bengal main teen dashak puraane laal kii jagah hare ne rang jamaaya tha
 Now, is Bengal again turning to saffron with aplomb? With the stream of polarization, is Bengal moving in this direction? If we look at West Bengal as a whole state, then it seems to be divided
 is vibhaajan ke kai aayam hai or kai dishaaen
 North Bengal, where it looks colored in saffron, still wants to see itself green
 jahaan tak left ke laal rang kaa sawaal he to ye ab bhi rajya ke kuch pokets main chhitaka dikhaai detaa he
 These are the pockets that still want to show loyalty with the left
 voting pattern ko dekha jaae to hindu or muslim votaron ke kamovesh vipareet dishaao main janaa saaf dikhataa he
 Apart from this, there were some divisions in Bengal
 bengali or gaiyr bengalisthaneey or bahritiemasi samarthak or tiemasi virodhilekin in sabase alag bengal se jo gunj sabase zyada naaron ke taur par sunai de rahi he wo ‘jai shriram’ or iske jawaab main ‘jai hind’ yaa ‘jai bangla’!chunaav ke baad pashchim bengal ne hinsa kii anek ghatnaon ko dekha
 So will religious polarization be the key to electoral success in the state in the near future
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne rajya se 42 loksabhaa siton main se 18 siton par jeet hasil kar safalataa kii nai ibaarat likhi
 63% of Muslim voters voted for TMC and 51% of Hindu voters voted for BJP
 haqiqat to ye he ki azaad bharat main bengal main pehle kabhi is tarah kaa dhruvikaran nahin dikhaa
 The BJP has been resorting to the slogan 'jai Shri Ram' loudly to strengthen the Hindu vote bank in Hindu-dominated areas of around 25 Lok Sabha constituencies of the state
 bengal main is tarah ke paridrishy par sipiem netaa mohammad saleem kehete hai- “pehle ham kaha karte the ki bengal jo aaj sochataa he wo baaqi bharat kal sochataa he
 But now it reversed during Mamata Banerjee's reign
 ab bharat jo pehle dekhtaa he bengal ab dekh rahaa he
 We used to hear slogans of 'jai Shri Ram' in the late eighties and early nineties, but the effect was not seen then
 lekin ab ramanavami or hanuman jayanti par ise vivaadit bana diya gaya jaise ki world cap match england main naa hokar yahaan ho rahaa ho
 This match of 'BJP vs Trinamool' is destroying the values and culture of Bengal
 ye bijepi banaam tiemasi nahin balki bijepi or tiemasi saath milakar bengal kii shanti or sauhaard ko palitha laga rahe hai
 Sometimes in the name of religion and sometimes in the name of language, they are trying to divide us
 ‘jai shri ram’ naare par kisi kaa paitruk adhikaar nahin he or naa hi ‘jai bangla’ or ‘jai hind’ par
 As far as Mamta Banerjee is concerned, she attended Iftar parties this week
 unke virodhiyon kii ore se aise aarope lagaae jate rahe hai ki muslim votaron ko lubhaane ke liye mamata banerjee aisa karti hai
 Mamta Banerjee has been participating in Iftar parties earlier also, but in this election season she also used Shayari to attack BJP
 id ke maukey par upasthit logon se mamata ne kaha, “bengal kii jameen sabake liye he, bengal kii mitti, bengal kaa jal, bengal kii hawa or bengal ke fal
 The land of Bengal Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swami Vivekananda, Rabindra Nath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam taught us that we are all one and we need not fear
 hamaare bich bhaichara hona chahie
 Hindu means sacrifice, Islam means honesty, Christian means love and Sikh means sacrifice
 yahi he hamaara bharat
 We will protect it
 jo bhi isamen dakhal dene kii koshish karegaa wo tabah ho jayega
 Therefore, there is no need to be afraid of anything
 jis tarah unhone iviem par kabja kiya, usee raftaar se wo waapas jaaenge, jai hind, jai bangla, jai bharat, shukriya
 "mamata Banerjee kept herself away from Iftar parties till the completion of seven phases of the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin nateezon ke elaan ke tatkaal baad saarvajanik taur par apni pehali upasthiti main hi mamata ne saaf kiya ki ve iftaar partiyon main hissaa lenaa jari rakhengi
 In the last week of Ramadan, where Mamta participated in many iftar, on Eid she gave her message in clear and strict words
 mamata ne hindi ke muhaavarey ko udt karte hue kaha- “jo hamase takaraayega, chur chur ho jayega
 Mamata Banerjee was accompanied by her nephew and MP from Diamond Harbor Abhishek Banerjee, Minister Javed Khan, MLA Idris Ali on the occasion
 is avasar par kolkata police kamishnar anuj sharma samet kai varisht police adhikariyon ko bhi dekha gaya
 Political observers attribute religious polarization to the bjp's rise in Bengal
 itihasvid maidul islam kehete hai, ye chintaa kii baat he kyonki azaadi ke baad pashchim bengal main apekshaakrit hameshaa shant maahaul rahaa he
 But now for the first time, there was so much tension in the two communities
 ek baat saaf he ki donon partiyaan samudaayon ke asli muddon ke bare main zyada nahin jaanati
 They are resorting to easy politics in which religious symbolism is resorted to
 lekin aaj jo jarurat he wo he donon samudaayon ke bich vaastavik samvaad, padosiyon ko jaanane ke liye saamaajik pahal or donon samudaayon ke logon kii ore se aage aakar shantipurvak ek duusare ke utsavon main shirkat kii
 The kind of polarization that is visible in Bengal is really surprising
 ”trinmul congress kii taraf se kai faislon ko unke virdohi muslim tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kaa nateeja bataate hai
 Such as the stipend to the Imams, changing the time of Durga immersion in view of Muharram etc
 bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey se jab poocha gaya ki aap aise aaropon par kya kahenge ki aap hindu bhaawanaaon kii raajnneeti kar dhruvikaran kii koshish kar rahe hai to unhone kaha, “nahin ham vaise nahin he jo muharram par durga maa ke visarjan ko roak den
 After this, people have to appeal to the court and the court should allow the immersion
 wo (mamata) chunaav se pehle masjidon main jaati hai or namaaj padhati hai
 Although i would say that it is good that she is setting an example
 lekin unhen saath hi mandiron main janaa chahie
 She is dividing religions, not us
 ham hameshaa kehete hai sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas
 "political analyst Shikha Mukherjee says in this subject," It should be looked at in a bigger dimension
 ye ek tarah kaa mobiligeshan he
 Use literal symbols that are very common and which everyone knows
 agar aap ‘jai shri ram’ ko len to ye mul taur par gaiyr bangla bhashiyon ke liye signal he jinaki bengal main acchhee sankhya he
 Kolkata alone has more than 60% of its population
 ye unke liye bahut ahm he jo bijepi ke vichaar se bahut prabhavit hai, hindu raashtra ke vichaar se prabhavit hai
 Some Bengalis are also involved in this
 mere vichaar se ye aahvaan unke liye hai jo bijepi se sahanubhuti rakhte hai
 As far as Mamta is concerned, she is not clear which slogan will work for her
 jai hind yaa jai bangla
 
 
 
 wo aashwast nahin hai ki unki raajnneetik sthiti kya he or kya unka raajnneetik naaraa he
 "it is all the same as the debate over who came first from chicken and eggs
" ye dhundhna mushkil he ki bijepi ne zyada teji se ‘jai shri ram’ ke naare ko apanaaya yaa mamata banerjee ne isse kinaaraa kiya
 This whole incident has brought Mamata Banerjee to such a cross where there are only two options to turn - Left or Right

 What do you say from behind the wickets? In the last match against Dhoni Ireland, the spinners took over for 30 overs
 iske baad dhoni se samvaadadaata sammelan main poocha gaya ki jab vah apane gendbaaji vikalpon par prayog karte hai to kya vah maanate hai ki vah captain ke rup main apana sarvshereshth kaam karte hai
 Dhoni smiled at this and he replied, 'no

 After this, he told that when you walk according to the strategy, then the captain's work becomes easier
 unhone kaha, ‘isse meraa kaam thodaa aasaan ho jaataa he kyonki aapke paas ranneeti hoti he lekin jab tak is par acchhee tarah se amal nahin kiya jaataa tab tak aap achche captain najar nahin aate

 Meanwhile, a post is now going viral on social media
 iske jariye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki modi sarkaar ne 10 karod rupye kii sampatti vaale netaaon kii pension band kar di he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being viral is false
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se is tarah kaa koi aadesh nahin diya gaya he
 The archived version of the post can be viewed
 fasebukapar viral post main likhaa ja rahaa he: "10 karod sampatti vaale netaa kii aaj se har tarah kii pension band, modi sarkaar kaa shandaar faisla

 Who gets pension Here it is very important to know that the word "leader" is used in common parlance for MP, MLA and every person who has ever contested an election
 centre or rajya sarkarein netaaon ko kisi tarah kii pension nahin detii
 Pension is given only to former mps and former mlas
 purv saansad ko kitni pensionis samay har purv saansad ko 25000 rupye prati maah pension milti he
 If a leader has been an MP for more than five years, his pension increases by two thousand rupees per month per year
 lok sabha ne agast 2018 mennoticejari karte hue saileri, alounces and pension of members of parliament act 1954 kesection 8amem kiye gaye is sanshodhan kii jaankaree di thi
 There is no direct intervention of the central government in how much pension the former MLA gives to the former MLA
 haalanki agar centre sarkaar purv vidhayakon kii pension main koi badlaav laana chaahe to uske liye unhen nayaa kanoon laana hoga
 Legislators have different pensions fixed in every state
 kis rajya main vahaan kii sarkaar vidhayakon ko kitni pension de rahi he, hamane isaki jaanch nahin kii he
 The Supreme Court rejected the petition, and last year, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court
 isamen saansadon ko milane vaali pension va anya bhatton ko khatm karne kii maang kii gai thi
 The Supreme Court dismissed this petition on 16 April 2018
 court ne centre sarkaar ke tark ko sahi tehraaya tha ki purv saansadon ko kaarykaal samaapt hone ke baad, pad kii garima ko banaae rakhane ke liye pension va anya bhatte diya janaa uchit he
 It became clear in the investigation that the claim being viral is completely wrong, the Modi government has not issued any such order

 Now the question arises how to find out
 
 
 -pati ke doston se dosti badhayen
 With this, you can keep an eye on him even when he is outside the house
 -pati ke offis kaa numberajrur rakhen
 So that when he does not pick up his mobile, then you will know the status by calling there
 -uske mummy-papa ko hameshaa confidence main rakhen or baat karte rahen
 -when he is opening the mobile, steal the eyes and remember the password
 jab wo mobile chhodkar bathroom main jaae to mobile check kar len
 Although it is wrong to check someone's mobile but if you have doubt then it is very important to clear the doubt
 -uske kapadon ko yun hi dhone ke liye mat daal dijie
 Check -usko ehsaas nahin hone de ki aap uski jasusi kar rahi hai
 By the way, the best way to clear your doubts is to talk to your partner directly, but if he is avoiding you then you can adopt these methods and remove your anxiety

 Just before the sixth phase of voting, the national presidents of Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi have attacked the Congress double
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne jahaan sajeesh rachane main bijepi or congress ko ek jaisaa bataaya he, to vahiin mayawati ne alvar repakand par congress kii gahalot sarkaar ko gheraa he
 Attacking the BJP and the Congress, Akhilesh Yadav said that both parties are the same, both spread rumors and both plot
 akhilesh ne kaha, 'pratapgarh kii raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party basapa ke saath nahin he balki duusare dalon kii madad kar rahi he
 Now the Congress is also spreading a similar rumor where elections are being held tomorrow (may 12)
 donon ko hi janata ne alag kar diya he, isliye jaan-boojhkar ye dal kanfusion failaana chaahate hai'
 Mayawati besieges Congress on the pretext of Alwar, on the one hand, Akhilesh Yadav, while giving the example of PM Modi, surrounded the Congress, considering itself strong in the battle of Purvanchal, on the other hand, BSP President Mayawati targeted the Congress government there on the pretext of Alwar rape case in Rajasthan
 Took on mayawati ne kaha, 'alvar kii ek dalit mahila ke saath vahaan ke dabang logon ne milakar gangrape kiya
 The more serious thing is that to suppress this disgusting incident, the Congress government did not allow the family to expose the intimidation case, till then there was no voting
 iske baad bhi bispi kaaryakartaaon ne aawaaj uthaai to is maamle main karrwai kii gai'
 In this way, just before the battle of Purvanchal, the SP-BSP fighting in the coalition has not only criticized PM Modi, but has also targeted the Congress

 Input: IANS 1857 kaa swadhinata sangram jise saamaanya taur par bharat kaa pehla swatantraaa sangram mana jaataa he, use pathyapustakon main badalane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 Now the Paika Rebellion of 1817, which took place before the revolution of 1857, would be considered the first war
 kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash javdekar ne kaha he ki 1817 ke pika vidroh ko agle satr se itihaas kii paathya pustakon main 'pratham swatantraaa sangram' ke rup main sthaan milegaa
 Let's know what is Paika Bidroh
 1817 main odisha main hue pika bidroh ne purvi bharat main kuch samay ke liye british raaj kii jade hilaa di thim
 Originally Paika was an unorganized army of peasants of Odisha's Gajapati Shakshas, who provided military services to the king during wartime and carried out farming in peacetime
 in logon ne 1817 main bakshi jagabandhu bidyadhar ke netritv main british raaj ke viruddh baghawat kaa jhanda uthaa liya
 The ruler of Khurda was traditionally the patron of the Jagannath temple and ruled the earth as his representative
 wo odisha ke logon kii raajnneetik or saanskrithik swatantraaa kaa pratik the
 Odisha was also annexed by the British in 1803, after the British Raj ruled Bengal province in the north of Odisha and Madras province in the south
 us samay odisha ke gajpati raja mukundadev dwitiya avyask the or unke sangrakshak jai raajaguru dwaara kiye gaye shuruaati pratirodh kaa krurta purvak daman kiya gaya or jayaguru ke sharir ke jinda rahete hue hi tukade kar die gaye
 After a few years, the Paika rebels led by Bakshi Jagabandhu, the hereditary chief of the unorganized army of Gajapati kings, revolted with the support of tribals and other sections of society
 pika vidroh 1817 main aarambh hua or bahut hi teji se fail gaya
 Although the Paika people played an important role in the rebellion against the British Raj, this rebellion was by no means a rebellion of a small group of people belonging to a particular class
 ghumsur jo ki vartmaan main ganjam or kandhamal jile kaa hissaa he, vahaan ke adivaasiyon or anya virgon ne is vidroh main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai
 In fact, the right occasion for the expansion of the Paika rebellion came when 400 tribals of Ghumsur entered Khurda, rebelling against the British Raj
 khurda, jahaan se angrej bhaag gaye the, vahaan kii taraf kooch karte hue pika vidrohiyon ne british raaj ke pratikon par hamalaa karte hue police thanon, prashaskeey karyaalayon or rajkosh main aag laga di
 The Paika rebels had the support of the kings, zamindars, village chiefs and common farmers of Kanika, Kujang, Nayagarh and Ghumsura
 yah vidroh bahut teji se praant ke anya ilaakon jaise purl, pipli or katak main fail gaya
 The British were stunned before the rebellion, but later they tried to retain the hegemony but faced stiff resistance from the Paika rebels
 baad main hui kai ladaaiyon main vidrohiyon ko vijay mili, lekin teen maheenon ke andar hi angrej antat: unhen parajeet karne main safal rahe
 After this, there was a massive phase of repression in which many people were put in jail and also lost their lives
 bahut badi sankhya main logon ko atyaacharon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Many rebels fought guerrilla warfare until 1819, but were eventually captured and killed
 bakshi jagabandhu ko antat: 1825 main giraftaar kar liya gaya or kaid main rahete hue hi 1829 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Although the Paika Rebellion is highly rated in Odisha and children grow up reading stories of valor in the fight against the British, this rebellion unfortunately did not get the national prominence it deserved
 aisi mahatvapurn ghatana ko itnaa kam mahatv die jane ke peeche kai kaaran ho sakate hai, lekin yah santosh kii baat he ki bharat sarkaar ne is vidroh ko samuchit pahchaan dene ke liye is ghatana kii 200veen varshganth ko uchit rup se manaane kaa nirnay liya he

 The school administration told them that enrollment will be given only if the parents are educated
 is par baldev ne pita ke sthaan par apana naam or mata ke sthaan par meraa naam likhva diya kyonki sarbajit pakistan kii jail main tha or uski patni sukhpreet padhi likhi nahin he
 Dalbir told that when i came to know about this, i had a quarrel with Baldev because the identity of that girl had changed
 unhone ne kaha ki main isse adhik kuch nahin kahana chaahuungi kyonki or koi maane yaa nahin maane main jaanati hum ki swapndeep sarbajit kii hi beti he
 Only when the CBI people come, i will present the evidence and know who is whose sister and who is the daughter

 Dalbir Kaur, who has been campaigning for the release of Sarabjit Singh, who is imprisoned in Pakistan, alleged that all this is a conspiracy of Baljinder Kaur and Baldev Singh who have fallen so much for money and are bent on doing harm to their own baby girl
 padosi mulk kii kot lakhapat jail main may 2013 main sarbajit singh kii kaidiyon ne peet-petakar hatya kar di thi
 After this, the state government, while giving him the title of martyr, announced to give a government job and financial assistance to his daughter
 tippaniyan Swapandeep got this job, about which BJP leader and Sarabjit's sister Baljinder Kaur alleges that she is Dalbir's daughter and should be sacked and get the case investigated by the CBI
 aapke kitne bachche hai, yah poochne par dalbir cor ne kaha ki meri ek beti thi
 She was strangled to death by my husband Baldev in 1984 when she was 11 days old and gave me several abortions by giving her medicine
 main us vakt nai thi or mahilaayein tab us sthiti main nahin thi jis sthiti main aaj hai, isliye main police main nahin ja saki
 She said that since 2011, she has been living separately from Baldev, who is still lodged in Haridwar jail due to fake land
 dalbir cor ne yah bhi kaha ki mere paas saare sakshya maujuud hai or wo mujhe kisi ko bhi dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Let the CBI come, i will provide all the evidence and i am ready for any investigation
 mujhe koi fark nahin padataa he
 Dalbir told that he had taken Swapandeep with my husband Baldev Singh to get him admitted to school
 skool prashasan ne unase kaha ki mata pita agar shikshit honge tabhi namakan milegaa
 On this Baldev got his name written in place of father and my name in place of mother because Sarabjit was in Pakistan jail and his wife Sukhpreet is not educated
 dalbir ne bataaya ki isaki jab mujhe jaankaree hui tab baldev ke saath meraa jhagada ho gaya kyonki us ladki kii pahchaan hi badal gai thi
 He said that i would not like to say anything more because no one else believes or believes, i know that Swapandeep is Sarabjit's daughter
 jab sibiai vaale aaenge tabhi main saboot pesh karuungi or pataa chal jayega ki koun kiski bahan he or koun beti
 It is noteworthy that BJP leader M

 Singh Goraya had said in a press conference on Monday that Swapnad is not Dalbir Kaur's daughter, but Sarabjit's daughter and she has fraudulently given the Punjab government job to her daughter
 pakistan kii jail main band sarbajit singh kii rihaai ke liye abhiyaan chalaane vaali dalbir cor ne aarope lagaaya ki yah sab baljinder cor or baldev singh kii sajeesh he jo paison ke liye itane gir chuke hai or apni hi bacchee kaa nuksaan karne par tule hue hai
 Sarabjit Singh was beaten to death by prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail of neighboring country in May 2013
 iske baad rajya sarkaar ne use shahid kii oopaadhi dete hue uski beti ko sarkari naukari tathaa aarthik sahaayta dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 The comments yah naukari swapndeep ko mil gai, jiske bare main bhaajapa netaa or sarbajit kii bahan baljinder cor kaa aarope he ki vah dalbir kii beti he or use tatkaal barkhaast kar maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karwaani chahie
 When asked how many children you have, Dalbir Kaur said that i had a daughter
 vah jab 11 din kii thi to mere pati baldev ne 1984 main uski galaa ghont kar hatya kar di thi or dawaai dekar usne kai baar meraa garbhpaat bhi karvaa diya
 i was new at the time and the women were not in the position they are in today, so i could not go to the police
 unhone bataaya ki 2011 se vah baldev se alag rah rahi hai jo jameen ke farjivade main abhi haridwar kii jail main band he
 Dalbir Kaur also said that i have all the evidence available and i do not need to give it to anyone
 sibiai waalon ko aane dijie, main sabhi sakshya uplabdh kar duungi or main kisi bhi jaanch ke liye taiyaar hum

 rafel vimaan saude main kathith aniyamitata ko lekar congress ne modi sarkaar par ek baar phir se hamalaa bolaa he
 On Friday, the Congress claimed that in respect of this fighter aircraft deal, a well-known Indian group defense company got a total contract of one lakh 30 thousand crore rupees
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman par nishaanaa saadhaa or un par desh se jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Surjewala, putting some documents in front, said, "the opening layers of the Rafale deal are opening up the reality of the lies spoken by the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister
 vahiin, bijepi pravaktaa ne maamle main pratikriya dete hue kaha ki congress nakaaratmak raajnneeti kar rahi he
 His allegations on the Rafale deal are meaningless
 # rafalescam60,145 karod ru
 The Rafael Deal proved that the culture of crony capitalism ie 3c's has become the DNA of Modi government
 ‘jhooth parosna’ va ‘chal-kapat kaa chakravyuuh bun’ desh ko barglaana hi ab sabase bade raksha saude main bhaajapai mul mantra he
 Our statement: -pic

 com / g33s2syt65 — Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala) July 27, 2018 He said that the Rs 60,145 crore Rafale deal proved that the culture of crony capitalism has become the DNA of the Modi government
 jhooth parosna or chal-kapat kaa chakravyuuh bunakar desh ko barglaana hi ab sabase bade raksha saude main bhaajapai mul mantra he
 This deal smells of damaging the state exchequer
 'unhone daawa kiya ki france ke saath 36 rafel vimaan kii kharid kaa samjhauta hone ke baad is vimaan saude se judaa contract sarkari company hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) se lekar ek nijee bhartiya samooh kii raksha company ko diya gaya, jabaki yah company samjhaute se 12 din pehle register hui thi or uske paas vimaan banane kaa koi anubhav nahin he
 According to Surjewala, this private Indian company issued a statement on February 16 last year, saying that it had received an 'offset contract' of Rs 30,000 crore and a life cycle contract of Rs 1 lakh crore linked to Rafale
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki ek sarkari vijyapti main rakshaamantri ne kaha ki unhen nijee company ko ofaset contract die jane kii jaankaree nahin he
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should answer on 'messing with national interests'
 isse pehlecongress adhyaksh rahul gandhiis company ko rafel vimaan kaa contract dene par piem modi par tanj kas chuke hai
 Surjewala asked why Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is lying to the country? Will the Prime Minister accept that the contract was taken away from HAL and given to a private group? Was the offset contract done without the permission of the defense minister? Congress doing negative politics: BJP, BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi accused the Congress of doing negative politics
 unhone kaha ki congress ne hameshaa nakaaratmak raajnneeti kii he or desh ko peeche dhakela he
 The Congress has always made air allegations about the Rafale deal, while Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the French government have proved it wrong
 iske baavjood baar-baar aise bebuniyaad aarope congress kii taraf se lagaae ja rahe hai, kyonki congress kaa nakaaratmak drushtikon he
 Trivedi said that the Congress did not allow defense production to take place inside the country, because the Congress wanted procurement from outside and their deal would continue
 hamaari sarkaar ne dephence production kiya
 We have never accused the Congress in Bofors nor in the Augusta deal
 unheen kii party main rahe netaaon ne hi in deal par sawaal uthaae the
 VP Singh accused the Congress of raising the issue of Bofors

 The amc's Invitation Card states that Advani will hand over these gardens to the public in the presence of Modi

 Advani resigned from all posts in June this year in protest against Modi being made the head of bjp's election campaign committee

 muslim personal lau board (AIMPLB) ayodhya (ayodhya) par 9 disambar se pehle rivyuu pitishan daakhil karegaa
 His announcement is also being disputed, because all the members of the board and the common Muslims are also against it

 ek chota sa mandir bhi hoga
 There will also be a church, a gurudwara and people of all religions will be treated there for free
 ' From Shahbano's trial to the issue of triple talaq, what the Personal Law Board used to say was considered to be the movement of the Muslims of the country

 # The bjp-led Modi government at the Center has announced 10 per cent reservation for the general class
 kendriya mantri ram vilaas paswan ne aarthik rup se garib savarnon ke liye aarakshan ke mudde par loksabhaa main bolte hue kaha ki unhen isse koi dikkat nahin he
 He said that he has already been demanding a quota for poor upper castes, which the Modi government has fulfilled
 mantri ne kaha ki abhi anusuchit jati or janajati or anya pichde varg ke sadasyon ko shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main vishesh maukey milte rahe hai
 The people of the upper caste used to criticize it, but now they are also being given reservation
 ab centre main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ko phir se mauka milanaa chahie
 In fact, the Constitution Amendment Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday to materialize the reservation for the general category
 is sambandh main rahi charchaa main hissaa lete hue ram vilaas paswan ne kaha ki aarakshan virodhiyon ko aarakshan dene se aarakshan majboot hoga
 He said that even when the recommendations of the Mandal Commission were being implemented, it was raised that the reservation should be given to the economically weaker sections too, but it could not be done
 narsimha raav ne bhi apane pradhanmantritv kaal main bhi savarnon ko kota dene kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin court ne maamle ko palat diya
 Union Minister Paswan thanked the Modi government and said that when the recommendations of the Mandal Commission were implemented, there was opposition across the country at that time
 lekin virodh karne waalon ko isliye rigerveshan nahin diya ja saktaa tha ki wo samvidhan ke anuchhed 16-4 se govern nahin hote the
 If the reservation to economically weaker upper castes does not affect the reservation of obcs and SC / sts, then what is the harm? Paswan said that only obcs and scs / sts were getting reservations
 kai dalon ne samay-samay par maang kii thi ki aarthik rup se pichde savarnon ko bhi aarakshan ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 This government has embodied this effort
 savarnon ko aarakshan dene se iskaa virodh khatm ho jayega or aarakshan or majboot hoga
 The minister also raised the fact that SC / ST Act was weakened by the SC / ST Prevention of Atrocities Act
 sarkaar ne fouran samvidhan sanshodhan karke use phir usee rup main kar diya
 The upper castes protested against it across the country, before SC / ST people demonstrated in April in which 12 people were killed
 in sabhi ghatnaon se savarnon ke man main asantosh kaa bhav tha
 Paswan said that the Modi government is tackling one issue each
 isi ke tahat aarthik rup se kamjor savarnon ko aarakshan ke daayre main laayaa gaya he

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has once again accused the Modi government of the Center for being step-motherly
 metro phej 4 se sambandhit EPCA kii ek report par sawaal khadey karte hue AAP party pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne bijepi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He said that in the last few days there have been many correspondence between the Central Government and the Delhi Government regarding Metro Phase 4
 isi sambandh main EPCA ne bhi ek report banaakar supreme court ko saunpi he, jis par aam aadmi party ko andeh he
 Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged, 'the way the EPCA has submitted its report to the Supreme Court, there has been doubt in my mind about it
 EPCA dwaara prastut kii gai report ko agar dhyaan se padhaa jaae, to yah saaf taur par najar aata he ki yah puri kii puri report bhaajapa kii taraf jhuki hui he
 According to AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj, the Delhi government has kept two things regarding Metro Phase 4
 pehali yah ki phej van, tu or thri main metro ke liye jo jameen kharidi jaati he, uske liye aadha paisa dilli sarkaar detii he or aadha paisa centre sarkaar detii he
 Secondly, whatever losses were incurred in running the metro, the central government and the Delhi government were to bear half of it
 haalanki yah bade hi aashcharya kii baat he ki ab metro phej 4 main centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki metro ke liye jo jameen kharidi jaani he, uskaa sara paisa dilli sarkaar de
 Also, whatever loss is there in running the metro, Delhi government should bear all the losses, which is not right at all
 saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki jab metro main kiraaya badhaane kii baat ho, to centre sarkaar kahati he ki nirnay ham lenge
 When there is an issue of free travel for women in the metro, the central government says that we will take a decision on this
 parantu jab metro phej 4 ke liye jameen kharidne kii baat aati he, to centre sarkaar kahati he ki sara paisa dilli sarkaar degi
 The Delhi government will also bear the losses incurred in the operation of the metro
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa aisa bartaav amanviya or asanvaidhanik he
 Taking the year ahead on the EPCA, Saurabh Bhardwaj said, 'on one hand the EPCA says that the metro is very important for Delhi
 isse dilli main pradooshan kaa str ghatega
 On the other hand, when the Delhi government proposes to build 6 corridors for the metro, the EPCA talks of building only three corridors
 jab dilli sarkaar 6 coridor ke liye paisa dene ko taiyaar he, to sirf teen coridor hi kyon banaae jaaen?' unhone kaha ki aisa isliye he, kyonki centre sarkaar aisa chaahati he
 He said that if we look at this whole matter carefully, it seems that EPCA has become an institution under the central government
 EPCA dwaara prastut ki gai report par sawaal uthaate hue saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki EPCA kii report ke mutabik in 6 coridor main se 3 jagah metro kii zarurat nahin he
 The EPCA says that metro is not needed from Lajpat Nagar to Saket, Inderlok to Indraprastha, Rithala to Bawana to Narela
 sirf 3 phej kii baat EPCA or centre sarkaar kar rahe hai
 Delhiites living in these three places are being denied Metro services
 doosraa yah ki dilli sarkaar kaa sara paisa dilli ke karadaataaon se aata he, to centre sarkaar in coridor kaa sara kharchaa dilli sarkaar ke upar daal kar kyon dilli ke karadaataaon par bhaar badhanaa chaahati he? philhal puure maamle main aam aadmi party ke netaa saurabh bharadwaj EPCA ke chairman ko ek khat likhakar dobaaraa vichaar karne kii apil kii he
