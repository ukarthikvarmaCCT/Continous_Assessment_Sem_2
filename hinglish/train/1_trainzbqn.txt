 ' unhone kaha, 'kabhi-kabhaar kendriya sansadeey board yaa kisi anya manch par kisi mudde par alag-alag raay hoti he or yah saamne aata he or media kahata he ki takaraav he

 ham ek parivaar kii party nahin hai, ham kaaryakarta aadhaarit party hai
 ' yah puche jane par ki amit shah kii kathith tap kii hui baatcheet main koun 'sahib' hai to singh ne kaha, 'aam bolchaal main log duusare ko sahab bolte hai
 In the same way, they are also called Sahabzade

 Until a few days ago, the same could be said about Manjusha art of Bihar
 lekin ab isamen nai jaan foonkane kii koshish shuru hoti najar aa rahi he
 Recently, at the fashion show of Northern India Institute of Fashion in Mohali, Chandigarh, Manusha Art costumes surprised everyone
 paramparaagat manjusha art ko is nae andaaj main pesh karne kaa shrey biharsharif ke ejineering chaatr kunal kumaar ko jaataa he, jinhone bhagalpur ke manjusha art ke jaankaar manoj kumaar pandit ke sahyog se ise anjaam diya
 Manjusha Art depicts the victory story of self-reliance and trust among women of Bihar, which has progressed towards women empowerment in the last few years due to government schemes and self-help groups
 isamen mukhyamantri cycle yojana, bhagalpur ke dharhara main ek bacchee ke paidaa hone par 10 ped lagane kii parampara, vot ke liye kataribaddh khadi mahilaayein, shiksha ke liye mahila jaagrukta jaise ahm pahalu pesh kiye ja rahe hai

 kunal kehete hai, ''manjusha art nari shashaktikaran kaa pratik he, usee pariprekshya main sho ke jariye bihar ke nari shashaktikaran ko focus karne kii koshish kii gai
 He believes that Manju art of Bihar can be brought alive only by giving it a modern form
 bhagalpur ke manjusha art prashikshan centre ke nideshak manoj kumaar pandit kehete hai, ''kai sansthaanon se manjusha dizin ke liye ofer bhi mili hai
 To make this art popular, it is necessary to add Manjuha Art with more and more useful materials
 ”now this folk art is also being used in letter pads, wedding cards, birthday cards, bags and dress materials
 naabard ne bhagalpur main mahila samoohon ko prashikshan or lone kii vyavastha shuru kii he
 Actually, Manjusha Art Ang is based on the struggle of Bihula, the folk heroine of the state
 manjusha ek bahumanjila nauka he, jis par kai prakaar ke jeev-jantu or vanaspati darshaae jate hai
 Green, yellow, pink color is used in it
 lok gaatha he ki bihula ke pati balalakhendra kii sarpdansh se maut ho gai thi, tab vah manjusha par savaar hokar swarg gai thi or pati ko punerjeevit kara pai thi
 In 1934, the British ICS officer W
W
 ji
 Archer exhibited Manjusha Art at India House in London
 iske jaankaar jyotish chandra sharma bataate hai, ''sarkari or gaiyr sarkari str par jo kadam uthaae jane the, ve nahin uthaae ja sake
 It is very important to associate this art with employment
 ''mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko bhi bhagalpur main sevayatra ke dauraan is kala ne prabhavit kiya he
 While taking stock of Manjusha painting exhibition, he has asked the officials to arrange for marketing

 shanivaar ko jab yuvaraj singh team india kii jersey main vishakhapattanam ke maidan par utrenge, yakeen maaniye 120 karod bharatiyon kaa 240 karod haath unki jaijyakaar main uthegaa
 The world of special coverage cricket on Yuvraj Singh is already tilted by Yuvraj
 cricket ke diggajon kaa maananaa he ki yuvaraj ek baar phir aapako wo sabakuch kar dikhaaenge jo saalon saal desh ke liye karte rahe hai
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the Yuvatim, is counting the hours of return to cricket when he came to know that Yuvraj has come into the team
 unki aawaaj, unki ankhen or uskaa andaaz ye bayaan kar rahaa tha ki ye khabar unke liye kitni ahm he
 T-20 World Cup: Yuvraj Singh's return to the team Dhoni's joy increased manifold because no one had imagined that Yuvraj would be ready to defeat the opponents on the field so soon after defeating cancer
 jo jajba unhone dikhaaya use salaam kiye bagaiyr hindustan rah nahin saktaa
 To say cricket is an easy-looking game of ball and bat, but people associated with cricket know how much Yuvraj must have pressed to come back in such a short time
 cricket kii duniya ko fakhr he ki uskaa ye jaanbaaj jindangi kii sabase badi jang jitkar usamen nayaa adhyay jodne aayaa he
 Yuvraj has his habit of giving gifts to Yuvraj, he has a habit of giving gifts to the country
 yaa yun kahen is kaam main unhen maharath he
 He started it with the first World Cup of his life
 janvari 2001 main unhone under-19 world cap main desh ko champion banaaya
 Yuvraj was the man of the tournament in that tournament
 yuvaraj kii adaa or bol, dekhie tasveeron main
 
 
 After that the wait was a bit longer
 lekin pehle hi world tii-20 main unhone jo dhamal kiya wo afasana hi ban gaya
 Class of 6 sixes and semi-final kangaroo bowlers in 6 balls against England
 or phir jab bharat main ekadivasiy world cap hua to hindustan ne ekbar yuvaraj kaa vahi avatar dekha
 However, this was the period when he was hit by cancer
 lekin yuvaraj ne apni jaan tak kii parvaah nahin kii
 And made the country world champion
 ab yuvaraj ko khitaabi jeet kaa chaukaa lagaana he
 They are busy in this preparation
 vaapasi par sabase zyada khush he macricket birdari jab itani khush he to sochiye jaraa is jaanbaaj kii maa kitni khush hongi
 The crown prince fought with cancer, but his son was the greatest fighter made by his mother
 ilaaj ke baad yuvaraj ne kaha tha main rota tha lekin maa nahin roti thi
 It is not that those stones are hearts, in fact, they realized that if they were broken, their son would be in deep trouble
 wo aaj apane bete ko vaapasi ke mukaam tak laayin hai is vishwaas ke saath kii yuvaraj ek baar phir vijeta hi sabit honge
 Bollywood also said, Welcome Yuvraj
 
 
 bollywood to itnaa khush he maanon uski tamaam muraadein ek saath puri ho gayi hon
 The cricket star was befriended by all the Bollywood stars
 wo sabhi aaj apane dost se kah rahe hai lado jeet tumhaari hi hogi
 Bollywood has almost as deep and old relationship with Yuvraj as Yuvraj has with cricket
 yuvaraj ke style or statement se kai sitaron tak ko rashk rahaa he or ab jab yuvaraj maidan par utar rahe hai to har kisi ko himmat dikhaane or kuch kar guzarane kii prerana mil rahi he
 The stars want this star to shine once again and when it shines, it will shine
 yuvaraj kii vaapasi ne sarhadon kii saare hadein tod di he
 Pakistani artists also want Yuvraj to play with their hearts and the above help him in doing so
 har khilaadi chahta he hameshaa chamakta rahe yuvarajdusare khelon ke khilaadiyon ko akasar cricket se shikaayat hoti he
 But now that Yuvraj is going to come into action, everyone wants to brighten the name of the country and his life too
 chand dinon pehle yuvaraj raashtrapati bhawan main the
 Arjuna award
 us shaam sabase zyada taaliyaan tab bazin jab yuvaraj kaa naam pukaara gaya
 Not because Yuvraj is a cricketer
 balki isliye ki wo khilaadiyon ke liye ek misaal hai
 Whether that player is associated with any sport and now when Yuvraj is going to beat cancer and come to the crease, everyone has sent him his best wishes
 ek khilaadi ke khushi or gam ko ek khilaadi hi sabase kareeb se jaanata he
 These players know how big a comeback challenge was for Yuvraj
 sabko ehsaas rahaa he ki yuvaraj kaa daanv agar ulta padaa to badi pareshaani ho sakati thi
 But when Yuvraj arrives here after beating the troubles, everyone wants that he will set many more examples
 sahi bhi he hindustan yuvaraj kii vaapasi kaa jashn manaa rahaa he
 Tomorrow, he will salute him with great vigor
 kyonki yuvaraj jis raah par nikal pade hai wo raah unhen itihaas main wo mukaam dilaa sakati he jo jise peedhiyaan saraahti hi rahen
 US President Barack Obama wishes that when he visits India in November this year, like the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his name plate should be presented before him
 ji haa, bharat daure par obama na sirf ‘hillari thali’ kaa swaad lene ko besabr hai balki vah apane naam par ek ‘obama thali’ kii bhi khwaahish rakhte hai
 It is worth noting that when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited India last time, Hillary's favorite restaurant 'bukhara' at the ITC Maurya Hotel in New Delhi had specially presented 'hillary Thali' in front of her

 dilli kii kai dikkaton kaa thikra duusare rajyon se aae logon ke sir footataa he, lekin beete chaar-paanch saal se baahar se dilli aane vaale logon kii dar yani migration kii dar sthir ho gai he
 Migration increased from 2001 onwards, but the rate stabilized between 2007 and 2011, which means fewer people are coming to Delhi for work or livelihood
 yah jaankaree assembly main peshdilli ke iconomic sarveymen di gai he
 Among those who come, the people of UP are the first to speak of those coming to Delhi from other states, while the highest migration of 43% was from UP

 The Afghan army took command of the country's security from the us-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)

 The Afghans, who had been at the mercy of foreign armies and administrators for three and a half decades, should have welcomed themselves to be left alone, but not because the lives and goods they would have to pay to fight the rise of the Taliban would be very much More and probably won't allow stability here
 gaur talab he ki 2014 main kareeb 5,000 afgaan sainik maare gaye jo ki 2001 main jang shuru hone ke baad se maare gaye iesaef sainikon kii sankhya se kahin zyada he

 Ashraf Ghani's tenure as president began with settling differences with the US and NATO, for which he signed agreements on bilateral security and the Status of Forces
 iske baad unhone pakistan se rishte sulajhaaye or china ke saath rishte majboot banaae, jiskaa islamabad kii siyaasi takaton par khaasaa asar rahata he
 Despite Pakistan's cooperation, it would be difficult to ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan, but without it the work would be impossible

 Rail services were severely affected after a fire broke out in a signal cabin here three days ago
 isse railgadiyon main bheed bad gai thi, jisase hue haadason main teen logon kii maut ho gai
 The Central Railway claimed that 85 percent of services would be normalized by Thursday night, except for some minor disturbances
 shuukravaar shaam tak 95 pratishat sevaayen saamaanya hone kii baat kahi gai he
 a Central Railway official said, "the restoration work is nearing completion
 ham ummid kar rahe hai ki shuukravaar shaam tak sthiti saamaanya ho jaaegi or yatriyon ko raahat milegi
 'rail services connecting Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) to the suburban and remote cities of Thane and Rayagada districts are gradually becoming normal

 The situation was created after a fire broke out at the main signal cabin at Kurla station
 isse harbar line va pashchimi railway main bhi gadabadiyaan fail gai thim
 All these are said to be the lifeline of Mumbai, carrying around 80 lakh passengers every day
 railgadiyon main deree, unke radd hone va unamem atyadhik bheed ke kaaran guuruuvaar ko teen yatriyon kii maut ho gai or 17 ghayal ho gaye
 Due to this incident and the chaos that followed, the state government and the Union Railway Ministry are facing severe criticism from the people and opposition parties
 yatriyon kii bheed kam karne ke liye shuukravaar ko bhi beasti va emesartisi (maharashtra rajya sadak parivahan nigam) kii atirikt sevaayen jari rahengi
 The central government has listed the controversial 'triple talaq' bill for its passage in the Lok Sabha today
 aadhikarik sutron ne buudhvaar ko bataaya ki sattarudh bhartiya janata party ne apane saansadon ko iske liye vip jari kiya he or unase sadan main apni upasthiti sunishchit karne ko kaha he
 The Bill together calls sudden divorce of three divorces as a crime and also provides for the conviction of a prisoner
 narendra modi sarkaar ne may main apana doosraa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad sansad ke is pehle satr main sabase pehle is vidheyak kaa masauda pesh kiya tha
 Many opposition parties have strongly opposed this, but the government says that the bill is a step towards gender equality and justice
 congress, trinmul congress or dramuk maang kar rahi hai ki ise jaanch padtaal ke liye sansadeey samiti ko saunpa jaae
 The bjp-led NDA government has an absolute majority in the lower house and it will not be a difficult task to get it passed
 lekin rajyasabha main sarkaar ko kadi pariksha kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he jahaan sankhya bal ke lihaaj se satta paksh par vipaksh baari he
 Some BJP allies like Janata Dal (U) have also expressed their reservations about the bill
 isse pehle narendra modi sarkaar ne apane duusare kaarykaal main muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak dene kii pratha ko samaapt karne se sambandhit vivaadaaspad vidheyak ko june main loksabhaa main apane pehle vidheyak ke rup main pesh kiya tha
 Amid heavy opposition from the House, the House had allowed the Bill to be supported by 186 votes against 74
 kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne sadan main 'muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak 2019' pesh karte hue kaha tha ki vidheyak pichhali loksabhaa main paarit ho chukaa he lekin solahavin loksabhaa loksabhaa kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone ke kaaran or rajyasabha main lambit rahane ke kaaran yah nishprabhavi ho gaya
 Therefore, the government has brought it back to this house
 unhone vidheyak ko lekar vipaksh ke kuch sadasyon kii aapatti ko sire se darkinar karte hue samvidhan ke moolbhoot adhikaron kaa hawala diya tha, jisamen mahilaon or bacchon ke saath kisi bhi tarah se bhedbhaav kaa nishedh kiya gaya he

 gaiyr congressi dalon ne anaupchaarik rup se aane vaale sansad satr main sushamaa ke khilaaf naa bolne kaa faisla liya he
 That is, in the case of Lalit Modi, the opposition will try to surround the government but avoid targeting Sushma
 vaise is masale par sushamaa ke alaava rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje bhi ghere main ai hai
 NDTV has been quoted by reliable sources as saying that the Trinamool Congress, NCP, JDU and Samajwadi Party have reached an agreement to "speak for Sushma-against-no-talk" over phone
 ek purv kendriya mantri ke mutabik "hamane is satr ke liye apni ranneeti par charchaa kii he or hamen lagata he ki sushamaji ek acchhee mahila hai
 His behavior has always been good and right
 ham sabake saath unke achche sambandh hai isliye naa ham unke khilaaf khadey honge or naa hi naare lagaayenge
 " vahiin congress kaa aarope he ki sushamaa swaraj ne britain yatra ke liye dastauez hasil karne main lalit modi kii madad kii he or isliye unhen istipha dena chahie
 However, there is not much aggressive attitude within the opposition parties other than Congress on this dispute that arose last month
 jaise ki jab trinmul congress ke saasand saugato roy ne swaraj kii aalochana kii tab ek twit ke jariye party ne saaf kar diya ki ye roy kii 'vyaktigat raay' he
 Similarly, when NCP MP DP Tripathi spoke against Swaraj, party chief Sharad Pawar advised him to be 'silent'
 tippaniyan Sushma Swaraj has defended herself on this issue, saying that she had helped Lalit Modi on humanitarian grounds so that he could visit his ailing wife in Portugal
 to kya vipaksh ke liye ye jawaab kaaphi he? ek rajaneta kehete hai "unka ravaiya hameshaa se acha hi rahaa he
 Yes, this dispute has been quite unfortunate but one thing is clear that we are not going to demand his resignation
 " It is a different matter that this soft attitude of the opposition is not for Vasundhara Raje, whose name is also implicated in this case

 According to a former Union Minister "we have discussed our strategy for this session and we think Sushmaji is a good woman
 unka vyavhaar hameshaa acha or sahi rahaa he
 We all have good relations with them so we will not stand against them nor shout slogans
 " At the same time, the Congress alleges that Sushma Swaraj has helped Lalit Modi in obtaining the documents for the UK visit and hence he should resign
 haalanki pichley maheene uthe is vivaad par congress ke alaava baaki ke vipaksh dalon ke bheetar bahut zyada akramak ravaiya nazar nahin aa rahaa
 For example, when Trinamool Congress MP Saugato Roy criticized Swaraj, the party made it clear in a tweet that it was Roy's 'personal opinion'
 isi tarah jab ensipi ke saansad deepi treepathi ne swaraj ke khilaaf apni baat kahi to party chif sharad pavaar ne unhen 'chup' rahane kii salaah de daali
 The comments is mudde par sushamaa swaraj apana bachaav karte hue kahati ai hai ki unhone maanviya aadhaar par lalit modi kii madad kii thi taaki vah portugal main apni biimaar patni se milane ja saken
 So is this answer enough for the opposition? Says a politician "his attitude has always been good
 haa, ye vivaad kaaphi durbhagyapurna rahaa lekin ek baat saaf he ki ham unke istife kii maang nahin karne vaale
 " ye baat alag he ki vipaksh kaa ye naram ravaiya vasundhara raaje ke liye nahin he jinka naam bhi is maamle main fansaa hua he

 masarrat alam maamle par piem narendra modi ne vipaksh kii jabardast maang ke aage jhukate hue bayaan diya ki aatankwaad or algaavvaad par koi dalbandi nahin
 i am angry with the House in this matter
 main sadan or desh ko vishwaas dilaataa hum ki sarkaar banane ke baad jo kuch bhi gatividhiyaan ho rahi hai, vah bharat sarkaar se na mashvira karke ho rahi hai, na jaankaree dekar
 We do not have any consensus in the decisions taking place in the state

 hamane rajya sarkaar se spashtikaran maanga he
 The house will be informed after clarification on this relationship from the state
 samvidhan kii maryaada main kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Earlier, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "many mps of this House have expressed concern over the release of separatist leader Masrat Alam
" main sadan ko aashwast kar dena chahta hum ki naagarik suraksha par hamaari sarkaar koi samjhauta nahin karegi
 On this issue, he gave a statement in Parliament that he told that the Center has sought clarification on the report sent by the Jammu and Kashmir government
 lekin vipaksh sarkaar ke bayaan se khush nahin he
 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said that if the Prime Minister wants to have an opinion on this issue in Parliament then why should he not separate from the Jammu and Kashmir government
 baad main congress ne walkout bhi kiya In fact, as soon as Lok Sabha proceedings started, Mallikarjun Kharge appealed to the speaker to accept the adjournment motion, saying that CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed would not have made this decision alone
 rajya main bijepi-pidipi gathbandhan sarkaar kaa hawala dete hue khadge ne kaha ki mufti ne zarur piem se baat kii hogi
 The BJP wants to keep itself away on the release of Masrat Alam, so Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu linked the issue to the BJP, citing the issue as national concern
 piem ke bayaan ke baavjood vipaksh hangaamaa karata rahaa or congress ne is mudde par sadan se vakout kiya
 Significantly, the release of radical Hurriyat separatist leader Masrat Alam is because his detention order was not signed by the Jammu and Kashmir government
 aakhir wo koun he, jo bollywood abhinetri jiya khan ke khudakushi ke maamle kii tafteesh ko uljhaana chahta he? ab is maamle se judaa ek aisa sansanikhej sach saamne aayaa he, jisane is sawaal ko lekar police ko sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 Because the handwriting of the so-called letters written by Zia recovered from Zia Khan's house and from her boyfriend Suraj Pancholi's house does not match
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya jiya ke ghar ke log jhooth bol rahe hai yaa phir 'khel' kahin suraj ke ghar main hua he?kya jiya ke ghar se baraamad aakhri khat jhootha he? yaa phir suraj ke ghar se mili lav-letters galat hai? aakhir kyon nahin mil rahi he jiya kii handriting? wo koun he, jo mukademe ko uljhaana chahta he? ye wo nayaa pench he jo baliwood kii haseen adaakara jiya khan kii khudakushi ke maamle main ab saamne aayaa he
 Although this screw can have many meanings, but the biggest and most important meaning of this is that there is definitely someone who wants to derail the investigation of Zia Khan's suicide case
 aakhir wo he koun?darasal, jiya khan kii khudakushi ke teen din baad uske gharavaalon ne jiya ke kamare se mili jis chah panne ke khat ko jiya kaa likhaa bataakar police ke hawaale kiya tha, jiya ke us khat kii handriting or suraj ke ghar se mili uske jiya ke paanch lav letters kii handriting ek-duusare se mail nahin kha rahi he
 In such a simple question, whose claim is wrong? Has the letter given by Zia Khan's family to the police written not by Jia but by someone else? Or that the love letters recovered from Suraj's house are wrong? You will remember that Jiya's family members had asked to get this letter from their house when they wrote Jia during Jia's last prayer meeting
 He searched his purse to recite a poem
 unhone bataaya ki tab ye chah panne kii chitthee jiya ke bahan ke haath lagi, jo jiya ne suraj ke liye likhi thi or isamen usne suraj kii jyadatiyon kaa zikr karne ke saath-saath khudakushi karne kii bhi baat kii thi
 However, in this letter neither the name of the sun was above nor the name of Jia below
 ye or baat he ki tab police ne isi khat ke binah par uske bwoyfrand suraj pancholi ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 Later, when the police arrived at his house to harass Suraj, the police found five love letters written by Jia, which Jia had allegedly written for Suraj
 maamle kii tafteesh ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye jiya ke aakhri khat kii handriting kii jaanch jitani jaruri thi, utani hi jaruri uske lav-latters ke handriting kii jaanch kii bhi thi
 But even before the investigation, the matter of not getting handwriting of both of them has been revealed
 kyonki jiya ke ghar se mili khat main likhaawat khadi he, jabaki suraj ke ghar se mili lav letters main likhaawat tedi
 Similarly, if the police sources are to be believed, then the letter 'I' in both the letters is also written differently
 jabaki 'lav' shabd kii banaavat main bhi kaaphi fark he
 However, the police is more suspicious because after suicide, he did not get any such letter from Jia's house
 jabaki mauka e vaardaat par pahunchnewale police waalon kaa daawa he ki unhone jiya ke ghar kii acchhee tarah talaashi thi
 However, this does not mean that the people of Jia's house are wrong
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki jab tak jiya kii likhi koi or cheez ke saath donon gharon se mili alag-alag khaton ke handriting kaa milan naa ho jaae, tab tak maamle par dhundh kii chadar jarur rahegi
 And the investigation of this case will proceed in a new way if both letters are found wrong
 udhar, ek akhbaar kii maane to jiya kii khudakushi ke baad jiya kii maa raabia khan or suraj kii maa jarina wahaab kii mulaakaat koi bahut acchhee nahin rahi
 In the midst of the changing situation, Zarina, when she went to meet Rabia, told Zarina of Rabia that her son Suraj was not fit for Jiya, then Zarina also retorted that she was right to say that, because Jiya is someone else Man was definitely more mature and tactful
 jarina kaa kahana tha ki jiya suraj se bahut pyaar karti thi or suraj bhi apane tareeke se uskaa khyaal rakhata tha
 Jia Khan committed suicide because his boyfriend Suraj Pancholi wanted to get rid of him
 ye khulaasa kiya he, jiya kii maa raabia khan ne apane us bayaan main, jo unhone jiya kii maut ke baad police ko diya
 In the exclusive copy of this statement of Rabia Khan, which is held by Aaj Tak, there are many other things related to Jia's life, which you will be shocked to know
 kya jiya se peechha chhudaana chahta tha suraj? kya he jiya or suraj ke rishte kaa sach? jiya kii khudakushi se pehle suraj ne kya kaha tha jiya kii maa se? raabia khan ke bayaan kaa ek-ek sach
 
 
 'jiya wanted to keep Suraj completely ill, but Suraj was constantly misbehaving with Jia and now all his attention had shifted from Jia to his career, while Jia was living for Suraj as before
 
 
 
 or bas, isi baat ne jiya ko andar se kuch is kadar tod diya ki jiya ne khudakushi kar lee
 'it is similar to the statement of Zia Khan's mother Rabia Khan, on the basis of which the police have filed a case against Jiah's suicide Suraj Pancholi for forcing her to commit suicide
 ajtak ke paas maujuud is bayaan main raabia khan ne police ko bataaya he ki kis tarah jiya khan or suraj pichley ek saal se ek-duusare ke behad kareeb the, lekin haal ke dinon main suraj usase peechha chhudaane kii koshish kar tha
 According to Rabia, Suraj was already trying to get rid of Jia
 lekin 18 may ko jab jiya suraj ke ghar gai or suraj chupake se jiya kii maa raabia khan se milane pahunch gaya, tabhi unhen is baat kaa pakke taur par ehsaas ho gaya
 According to Rabia Khan's statement, after this, he became convinced that Suraj was no longer with Siria
 is vaakye kaa zikr karte hue raabia khan ne apane bayaan main bataaya he, '18 may kii subah saadhe aath baje jiya bag lekar kahin jane ke liye nikal padi
 Suraj received a call from me at 10:30 and asked if i can come to see you
 When i said yes, he came to my house in a red jogging suit and asked, do you know where Jia is? i said that she has gone to an event and will come back to Mande
 lekin tab suraj ne bataaya ki jiya kii flite miss ho gai he or wo uske (suraj ke) ghar par he
 i said what happened then? Do you love each other a lot? But after this, Suraj started crying and he said that since childhood he has seen his parents fighting
 usne apane pitaaji ko kaam naa milane kii vajah se depressant main jate dekha he
 He hates his father a lot, because his father treated his mother very badly
 is par maine poocha ki wo kahana kya chahta he? to phir suraj ne kaha ki jab uskaa kaam shuru ho jayega to wo jiya ko vakt nahin de sakegaa
 According to Rabia Khan, he tried his best to convince Suraj that day, but when he realized the motives of Sooraj, he told Suraj that he felt that his focus was now to move away from Jia to his career
 Is turned to the side, while Jia's focus is on the same
 lekin suraj kii jiya khan kii maa se baatcheet abhi khatm nahin hui thi or uske baad usne jo kuch bataaya use sun kar raabia buree tarah chaunk gai
 Here, Jia's mother sms Suraj to stop playing with his life and on the other hand, Suraj's father abuses his son in front of Jia's corpse
 aakhir kya chal rahaa tha khan or pancholi parivaar ke darmyaan
 Jia's mother Rabia Khan's statement answers every question
 raabia khan ne police ko die gaye apane bayaan main bataaya he ki unki beti jiya ne ek baar pehle bhi khudakushi kii koshish kii thi or is baat kaa pataa unhen kisi or nahin balki jiya ke bwoyfriend suraj se hi chalaa
 Rabia has said that the day Sooraj left Jia in his house and went to meet him, Sooraj told him that Jia had cut his hand one day
 raabia kaa kahana he ki tab usne suraj se isaki vajah poochi thi or suraj ne khud bataaya tha ki jiya apane kaam se zyada usase pyaar karti he
 According to Rabia, he then told Suraj that he also had fifty percent responsibility for this situation
 raabia ne bataaya he ki iske baad unhone apni beti se bhi baat kii or unhen is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki suraj jiya se kinarakshi kar rahaa he
 So, on May 28, he wrote an SMS to Suraj himself, 'quit playing games with you guys
 
 
 'is par usne jawaab diya,'aap ham donon ko canaphyus kar rahi hai
 
 
 'rabia says that the other day she turned the sun and made another SMS,' Let my daughter think openly about herself
 iske baad uske saath hone par tum phir apane focus se hatoge or apane mata-pita ko pareshaan karoge
 Now let it be peace
 
 
 maine pichley ek saal main is bare main kuch bhi nahin kaha, lekin ab main sabakuch samaj gai hum
 If you remain in his attention, then his life will be ruined
 
 
 'raabia ke mutabik suraj ne tab is esemes kaa koi jawaab nahin diya, lekin usne jiya ko esemes karke use ek baar phir pyaar, shaadi or ghar basaane kii baat zarur kahi thi
 And when he came to know about this, he advised Jia to be careful
 phir teen may yani jiya kii khudakushi vaale din wo jiya ke saath hi apane ghar se baahar nikali thim
 Jiya went to her brother Faizan's house, while Rabia went to her friend Anju Mahendru's house
 jahaan raat ko suraj kaa pita aditya pancholi bhi apni ek garlfriend ke saath aayaa or ye baat raabia ko acchhee nahin lagi or wo waapas apane ghar ke liye ravaanaa ho gayi
 But coming home, he saw that Jia had committed suicide
 khabar milane par anju or aditya donon unke ghar pahunche
 But Aditya Pancholi said right there, 'my son put his career on
 ab jaae banaae apana kariyar
 
 
 According to Rabia, he later came to know from a friend of Jiya that Jiya was pregnant with Suraj and had got abortion done
 vaise apane is bayaan main raabia ne donon ke bich gujarey achche dinon kaa bhi zikr kiya he or bataaya he ki kis tarah suraj unhen do baar dinar par le gaya tha or jiya se apane pyaar kaa izhaar kiya tha
 But things changed later
 aakhir wo kya baat thi, jisane suraj ko jiya se dur kar diya
 And when Jia's heart was broken, what did she write for Suraj? In her last letter from Jia's room, the entire reality of their relationship is recorded
 is khat kii maane, to jiya khan ko kariyar kii naakaami ne nahin, balki muhabbat kii naakaami ne maar daalaa
 'I don't know how to say this to you but i can say that i have nothing to lose now
 main pehle hi sab kuch ganvaa chuki hum
 By the time you are reading this, maybe i will have departed from the world before that
 
 
 main andar se tut chuki hum
 i loved you and i got rewarded in return
 tumne har roj mujhe sataaya
 Broke all my dreams ab main or jeena nahin chaahati
 
 
 'this is Majmoon, the last account of Bollywood's savory actress Zia Khan, due to which Mumbai Police on Monday arrested Suraj Pancholi, the son of Jia's boyfriend and actor Aditya Pancholi
 is khat main jiya ne apane bwoyfrand se shikaayat karte hue naa sirf us par bewafaai kaa ilzaam lagaaya he, balki ye bhi bataaya he ki kis tarah uske bwoyfrand ne use dhokhaa diya or uske saath marpet kii
 Jia further wrote in this letter how she handed over her everything to her boyfriend and the boyfrand kept playing with her feelings
 'goa kaa daura mere janmdin kaa tohfa tha phir bhi tumne beyimaani kii
 i miscarried
 tumne meraa christmas or mere janm din kaa dinar barbaad kar diya jabaki maine tumhaare janm din ko khaas banane kii bharpoor koshish kii thi
 i do not see love and dedication for you
 mujhe dar he ki tum mujhe maansik or shaareerik rup se chot pahunchaaoge
 Your life is limited to party and girls only, whereas my life was yours and mine
 agar main yahaan rahati hum to tumhen miss karongi isliye main 10 saal ke filmi kariyar or sapanom ko alavida kah rahi hum
 
 
 'at present, the police have registered a case of abetment to suicide under section 306 of IPC against Aditya Pancholi's son Suraj on the basis of this letter

 desh bhar main railgadiyon main biotoilet lagane kaa abhiyaan joro par he
 In this connection, biotoylets have been fitted in all trains running on the rameswaram-manmadurai railroad
 is tarah se rameswaram-manamdurai railmarg desh kaa pehla green train corndor ban gaya he
 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu will flag off the rameswaram-manmadurai railroad to become a Green Train Corridor on Sunday, July 24, through video conferencing
 pradhanmantri modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan ko amali jama pehanaane ke liye rail mantralay ne railway steshnon or railgadiyon ko svachh rakhane kaa kaam pramukhataa se shuru rakhaa he
 In this connection, the work of making biotoyletal trains was started
 isse jahaan ek taraf railway line par malmutra girane se hone vaali gandagi ko roka ja sakegaa to vahiin toilet main pani ke istemaal kii barabaadi ko kam kiya ja sakegaa
 By 2019, till 30 June, the Ministry of Railways has fitted 40,750 biotoylets in passenger coaches
 maujuuda vitt varsh main railway 30,000 biotoilet or laga degi
 Railways aim to have only biotoylets installed in all railway trains across the country by September 2019
 is tarah se 2019 tak puure desh main railway linon par girane vaale malmutra se desh ko mukti mil jaaegi
 The first stop in this scheme is the rameswaram-manmadurai railroad
 114 kilometre lambey is railmarg par chalane vaali sabhi trainon main sirf or sirf biotoilet hi lage hai
 Hence, the rameswaram-manmadurai railroad has been completely freed from human feces and urine falling on the tracks by trains
 24 july ko hogi ghoshnaa24 july ko khud railmantri rameswaram-manamdurai railmarg ko desh kaa pehla green train corndor ghoshit karne ja rahe hai
 There are 10 passenger trains on the rameswaram-manmadurai rail route
 in sabhi railgadiyon main 286 reldibbe hai jinamein sab main biotoilet laga diya gaya he
 After the rameswaram-manmadurai railroad, the okha-kanalas Junction (141 km) rail line, porbandar-vansjaliya (34 km) and jammu-katra (78 km) railways will be freed from excreta falling on the tracks
 iske liye in sabhi railmargon par chalane vaali gadiyon main biotoilet lagane kaa kaam jari he or ise jald hi puraa kar liya jayega
 In fact, common toilets made in trains running on Indian Railways pour feces and urine directly on the tracks
 isse patariyon par gandagi rahati he
 To overcome this, Indian Railways in collaboration with Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) developed biotoylets
 in toileton kii khaasiyat ye hoti he ki inamen mel-mutr ekatrit karne ke liye ek tanks bana hota he or is tanks main khaas tarah ke bactryria mel-mutr ko dikampoj karke pani main tabdeel kar dete hai
 Due to this, the process of falling dirt on the tracks is being stopped

 i sit back and read the remaining 50 pages of The Bad Boys Guide to the Good Indian Girl
 train thodi der ke liye sheenv stesan par rukati he
 When the train is about to run, some sizzling women in a wet sari enter the train and sit in the seats next to me
 ve aapas main baaten karke khub thahaake laga rahi hai ki kis tarah unhone daudkar train pakad lee, jo ekadam chhootane hi vaali thi
 It seems to me that they were behaving exactly like school girls, although they seemed to be around forty
 mujhase kareeb saal bhar badi ek ladki unki baatcheet main shaamil ho jaati he
 The three start laughing a lot while talking among themselves
 bhaikhla stesan aane par unke saath baithi ek ladki mujhase mukhaatib hoti he
 She asks in English, "are you Indian
" '' yah vah sawaal he, jisase main aksar rubaru hoti rahati hum
 i tell them, "I am from Mumbai
 '' ''kya aapako nahin pataa ki train main aise kapade pahanane kii ijaajat nahin he
 "I say wonder," what really
 '' aisa kahaan likhaa he
 "I deliberately look into the walls of the train in such a way as to try to see if a red colored cross has been placed, forbidding the wearing of certain kinds of clothes
" thik tabhi do anya auraten marathi main fabtiyaan kasati hai, jiskaa matlab he behayaa or veshya
 If i had not traveled in the compartment of second class women of the local train while studying college here for five years, i would have realized that i have made a big mistake by wearing such a dress
 ve lagaataar mere khilaaf apane gusse kaa izhaar karti ja rahi thim
 She was understanding that i did not understand her language, because i was reading an English book and had different clothes
 lekin unki fabtiyaan jab bardaasht se baahar ho gayi to maine apni dayee ore baithi ek antee se hindi main kaha ki main marathi samajhti hum
 Then she started speaking in Hindi and told me that how i am going against Indian culture, how i am traveling in such a way, wearing clothes that show my body, how i am not worried at all that people are staring at me Huh
 yah badi ajeeb sthiti he
 While traveling in Mumbai's local train for a long time, i have learned that it is better to remain silent
 agar main ek shabd bhi angreji main boluungi to ve spasht kah dengi ki mujhe pratham shrenee main safar karnaa chahie
 But i do not have the money to buy a first class ticket
 main un mahilaon ko kahati hum, ''kya maine aapaki baatcheet main kisi tarah kaa dakhal diya he

 If you do not like my dress, then make your mouth furrow

 The more i thought about this subject, the more i felt that this incident had nothing to do with any class or language
 yah sidhe-sidhe vichaardhaara kii baat he or kis tarah hamamen se kuch logon ne ghutti main pilaai is baat ko aatmsaat kar liya he ki ek acchhee bhartiya ladki main kya gun hone chahie
 i was forced to think about the division within women, which in a way gives rise to another gender
 main sochane lagi ki kya vastav main ham nariwad kii ek nai dhara ko janm de rahe hai, jo pink chaddi, holabaque, shoot ait site, slot vaak, yahaan tak ki pli
 It is being expressed in the form of movements like Mend the Gap
 is nae andolan kaa hissaa banane ke liye khud ko nariwadi ghoshit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Actually, i am very sure that its ardent supporters are women who live their way without worrying about any social and family customs
 ve apni marji kii maalik hai or samaaj kii roodhiyon ke aage jhukne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 They are not compelled in any way for biological reasons to be women, who are free from all kinds of shame
 ve nari hone ke kaaran khud ko shashakt maanati hai, na ki ablaa
 The number of such women may still be small, but they are a significant minority, because despite all the protests, they are deciding their future with their own hands
 unka yudhakshetra saarvajanik sthaan he
 Through her thinking, she is taking the feminist movement to new heights and forging an unbreakable relationship between the right to equality for women and her right to enjoy
 yah varg sangharsh nahin he or nishchit rup se sirf angrejibhashi duniya tak simit nahin he
 This can be seen among all sections, where women are revolting like this and demanding the right to education, right to work, right to choose a life partner, irrespective of the marriage that parents decide
 Don't uttar-aadhunik bhartiya mahilaayein un kshetron main dakhal de rahi hai, jinamein kadam rakhane se bhi ve darati thim
 The kind of life she is living now, it was also difficult for an earlier woman to imagine: independent
 shaharon main ve apane ghar se dur ek, do yaa teen bedroom vaale makaanon main rah rahi hai
 She is breaking the custom and adapting herself to a variety of complex roles
 vah rasoighar main anaadi hone se nahin darati, na hi vah swaadisht khaanaa pakaane se darati he, vah maa banane yaa na banane kii baat bhi nahin karti he
 She is making her own identity
 nari hona uske liye kamajori nahin he
 She is raising her hand and asking all of us to move towards a society free of gender boundaries

 The management of the first Rising Pune Supergiant team called him 'old' and removed him from the captaincy of the team and replaced him with Australia captain Steve Smith
 phir unka balla bhi nahin chalaa
 However, he showed his old form with a brilliant innings and told that he still has power
 maalikon kii najar main bhale hi dhoni ab laayak na hon, lekin cricket ke jaankaar unki ahmiyat samajhate hai
 That is why the new captain Steve Smith is not able to move one step without the advice of Dhoni
 iskaa saboot haal hi main ek Video main bhi saamne aayaa he, jisamen smith funsane par daudkar dhoni se salaah lete dikh rahe hai
 Although Steve Smith is seen taking advice from Dhoni many times in the match, but the latest case was faced in the match against Mumbai Indians, when in the last over of the innings, Smith was seen taking advice from Dhoni
 gauratlab he ki is match main pune ne romaanchak tareeke se teen ran se jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments is video main safataur par dekha ja saktaa he ki kaise smith salaah lene ke liye dhoni kii ore jate hai or phir ajinkya rahane bhi vahaan pahunch jate hai
 It is worth noting that we have seen Dhoni on many important occasions, losing his match under his captaincy, in the bag of Team India
 baad main ajinkya rahane ne bataaya tha ki aakhri over main smith, mujhamen or maahi bhai main is baat ko lekar charchaa hui ki ye over thakur or jayadev unadakat main se kise diya jaae
 In such a situation, we felt that the ball was not bowled fast in the last over and we got the last over from Unadkat
 jayadev kii raftaar thakur kii tulana main kuch had tak kam he
 Also, his slow ball is also very effective
 ' gauratlab he ki is match main pune ne mumbai indians ko teen ran se haraane main safalataa hasil kii thi
 The match was played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai
 steve smith vaise to match main kai baar dhoni se salaah lete dikh jate hai, lekin taaja maamla mumbai indians ke khilaaf hue match main saamana aayaa, jab pari ke aakhri over main smith dhoni se salaah lete dikhe
 Significantly, in this match, Pune won thrillingly by three runs

 If the country is going to talk about anything other than the World Cup in the next few days, then it is the Land Acquisition Bill
 bharat main pehali baar bhoomi adhigrahan bill 1894 main aayaa tha
 This law was made by the British and was therefore obviously unwarranted and exploitative
 yah kanoon 120 saalon baad pichley saal 2014 main badla ja sakaa tha
 The NDA government now wants to change this bill, on which the opposition from Anna to the opposition is ready to create a ruckus
 jaaniye kya he bhoomi adhigrahan bill main or kyon ho rahaa he iskaa virodh
 No acquisition of cultivable multi-cropped land: In the matter of land acquisition and rehabilitation, the government will not consider land acquisition which either private companies would like to do for private projects or in which multi-cropped land has to be taken for public projects
 agar kanoon banataa he to yani agar ye vidheyak kanoon ban jaataa he to bahu-fasali sinchit bhoomi kaa adhigrahan nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Those who will get the land, what will be found in the game, there is a detailed rehabilitation package for the owners of land and dependents on the land
 isamen un bhoomihinon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he jinaki roji-roti adhigrahit bhoomi se chalati he

 mukademebaaji kaa chakkarsarkaar ne jameen adhigrahan par upie sarkaar ke bill main sabase ahm badlaav retrospective cloj ko lekar kiya he
 The 2013 law provided that if the acquisition of a land had been on paper for 5 years, the government did not have possession of the land and compensation was not given, the original owner could demand the land back
 lekin ab sarkaar ne isamen yah praavdhaan jod diya he ki agar maamla adaalat main chalaa gaya he to mukademebaaji ke vakt ko 5 saal kii miyaad main nahin joda jayega
 Five year condition removed: The government has also removed the condition of starting work on the land within five years
 puraane bill ke tahat jameen lene ke baad companiyon ko paanch saal ke bheetar us par kaam shuru karnaa jaruri tha
 But now this restriction has been lifted
 puraane bill main vyavastha thi ki paanch saal ke bheetar kaam shuru na hone par jameen maalik is par dobaaraa daawa pesh kar sakate hai
 Definition of compensation The government has also changed the definition of compensation under the retrospective clause
 puraane bill ke mutabik agar sambandhit vyakti ko milane vaala muaavja uske khate main nahin bhi gaya he or sarkaar ne adaalat main yaa sarkari khate main muaavja jamaa kara diya he to use muaavja hi mana jayega
 Relaxation in accountability provisions The NDA government has also loosened the provisions laid down to ignore the legal and take action against officers who break the law
 bill main nae badlaav ke mutabik kisi afasar par karrwai ke liye ab sambandhit vibhaag kii anumati lenaa jaruri hoga
 That means the officers will escape cleanly

 hokar rahegaa jameen adhigrahanakendre sarkaar ne jis tarah se nayaa adhyadesh jari kiya he usase saaf he ki jameen maalik chaahe na chaahe, bhoomi kaa adhigrahan hokar hi rahegaa
 If he refuses to take compensation, the landowner can be evicted from his land by depositing it in the government treasury

 nilanjan kehete hai, "sanjoy chakravarti, devesh kapur or nirvikaar singh kii haal hi main publish hui research ne yah darshaya he ki bhartiya-america zyaadaatar democrat party kaa samarthan karte hai

 indian-americans concentrated on the eastern and western coasts mostly live in Democratic territories
 "'bharatiyon main ghat rahi democrat ke prati lokapriyata'deshmukh ne bhartiya samudaay main democrat ke prati ghatati lokapriyata ke bare main bhi bataaya

 Malpani has divided them into three groups: first, career-loving women who do not want to leave for maternity leave in the race to reach corporate heights; Secondly, models, actresses and socialites who do not want to 'spoil' their decayed body and thirdly, women who read the newspaper reports and realize that surrogacy is a painless way of giving birth to a child

 a similar truth is coming out in the case of the removal of AIIMS Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) Sanjeev Chaturvedi

 piem or swasthya mantri kii baatcheet ke baad secretary lav verma ne khud ek report piemo ko bheji, lekin is report main na keval tathyon ko chipaaya gaya, balki galatabayani bhi kii gai
 In the report sent by the Health Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office, it was not told that bjp's senior leader JP Nadda repeatedly wrote a letter to remove Sanjeev Chaturvedi, while the truth is that on page 71 of Sanjeev Chaturvedi's file he The proposal for removal from the post of CVO starts with the letter of JP Nadda
 sach yah bhi he ki chaturvedi ko hataane ke prastaav par health secretary lav verma ke bhi dastakhat hai, jinhone piem ko yah report bheji
 Surprisingly, JP Nadda has not even been mentioned in the report sent to the Prime Minister
 jepi nadda bijepi ke bade netaa hai, or is vakt vah bijepi mahasachiv hone ke saath party sansadeey board ke sadsy bhi hai

 aagaamidilli vidhansabha chunaavamein bijepi sabase badi party ke rup main ubharegi, lekin chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki popularity ke maamle main 'aam aadmi' kejariwal pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi aage nikal gaye hai
 All these things have been revealed in the India today-cicero survey
 pichley saal 49 din tak dilli kii satta sanbhaalane vaale purv mukhyamantriaravind kejariwalpopularity ke maamle main kiran bedi se aage hai
 Significantly, the BJP has announced its Chief Ministerial candidate in the Kiran Bedico Delhi Assembly Election
 mukhyamantri ke taur par dilli ke logon kii pehali pasand kejariwal hai or duusare number par kiran bedi hi hai
 Another surprising thing is that in this case Kiran Bedi has defeated all the old leaders of BJP
 isi hafte ke shuru main hue india today-siciro pole main dilli ke 41 fisadi log aam aadmi party ke sanyojak ko mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhnaa chaahate hai, jabaki kiran bedi ko 38 fisadi log pasand karte hai
 But the Congress is far behind in this race and only 12 per cent people see their faces in Delhi elections as Ajay Makenco
 bijepi main kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane par logon kii milijuli raay dekhne ko mili
 While 43 per cent of the people felt that the decision was right, 44 per cent believed that it was wrong to make Kiran Bedi the chief ministerial candidate
 is survey main bhaag lene vaale aadhe se zyada logon kaa maananaa he ki chunaav se pehle mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar vot khinchne main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he, jabaki party ke naam par sirf 23 fisadi vot milte hai
 Kejriwal was also questioned about Delhi's former Chief Minister of Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal with the people of Delhi
 haal hi main dilli ke ramlila maidan main hui raily main pradhanmantri modi ne kejariwal ko bhagoda kaha tha, lekin dilli kii janata aisa nahin maanati he
 Only 30 percent of the people of Delhi consider him as a fugitive and only 14 percent of people consider him anarchy
 jab logon se poocha gaya ki modi ke kehane ke anusaar kya kejariwal ko jangal main jaakar naksaliyon ke saath rahanaa chahie to ascharyajanak rup se 44 fisadi logon ne haa main jawaab diya, jabaki 34 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki pradhanmantri ko aisa bayaan nahin dena chahie tha
 However, Kejriwal has always been criticized for resigning from the government within 49 days of last year
 or kejariwal khud bhi ise apane raajnneetik jivan kii sabase badi galati maanate hai, lekin unke liye raahat kii baat ye he ki dilli ke kareeb 50 fisadi voter unhen pasand karte hai
 25 percent consider him a charismatic leader, while 22 percent people consider him a political leader
 kiran bedi par dilli kii raianan-fanan main kiran bedi ko bijepi main shaamil kiye jane par dilli ke 37 fisadi votaron kaa maananaa he ki unhen kejariwal kii kaat ke taur par party main shaamil kiya gaya he
 In every election, the voters of Delhi also see a change in the bjp's strategy, keeping Modi's face in front of them, seeking votes and declaring Kiran Bedi as the CM candidate in Delhi
 kam se kam 12 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki is baar bijepi ko bhi modi lahar par bharosa nahin he
 When people were asked if Kiran Bedi is a natural election for BJP, 28 percent of the people answered yes
 13 fisadi logon ko lagata he ki dilli main bijepi ke paas koi cheharaa hi nahin tha
 65 percent of Delhi voters believe that Kiran Bedi did right by joining BJP
 dilli chaahe dibetadilli ke 72 fisadi voter chaahate hai ki chunaav se pehle teenon partiyon ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaaron ke bich bahes ho
 Significantly, as soon as the BJP announced Kiran Bedi as its chief ministerial candidate, Kejriwal challenged him to debate among the public
 kiran bedi ne shuruyaat main to iske liye hami bhar di, lekin baad main unhone kaha, kejariwal ke saath bahes ab dilli vidhansabha main hi hogi
 On the other hand, Ajay Maken, the face of Congress in Delhi, also agreed to the debate
 dilli kaa netaa kaisaa ho?yah ladaai badi dilachasp rahi or dilli ke 40 fisadi votaron ne arvind kejariwal ko apana netaa mana, jabaki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko sirf 31 fisadi vot mili
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was nowhere to be seen in this race and he got 7 percent of the votes of Delhi
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi main dilli ke maatr 1 fisadi log apana netaa dekhte hai
 While three times Chief Minister in Delhi, Sheila Dikshit is considered as the leader by 3%
 ye to avasarvadita hedusri partiyon se netaaon kaa aayaat kar bijepi main shaamil karne ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par dilli ke 47 fisadi votaron ne ise galat bataaya or kaha ki yah avasarvadita ko badhaava dene jaisaa he
 However, 36 percent do not believe so
 yahi nahin, 49 fisadi logon ne mana ki bijepi ke jin puraane netaaon ko tikat nahin diya gaya he ve chunaav main party ko nuksaan pahunchaayenge
 How it happened In this survey of surveyindia today-cicero, about 2000 people of 35 assembly seats in Delhi were asked questions
 survey puri tarah se nishpaksh or antarrashtriya maanakon ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 Proteins present in milk and other nutrients including calcium are helpful in human physical development
 shaayad isi vajah se aaj puri duniya 'world milk de' celibratt kar rahi he
 While Congress leader Milind Deora has uploaded a video of the mistreatment of animals in dairy farms on his official Twitter account
 is video ke saath devda ne united neshans ko tag karte hue likhaa, 'yah na bhoolen ki doodh ke liye gaay kaa barbarta se garbhaadhan hota he or baad main unhen marane ke liye kasaaikhane bhej diya jaataa he
 'this video shows the genuineness of dairy farms being run for milk production
 kya kabhi aapane sochaa he ki itane saare logon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye itane bade paimaane par doodh kaa utpaadan kaise hota he
 Many times these animals are also subjected to cruelty in order to produce more
 video main dikhaaya gaya he ki gaay sirf ek hi kaaran se doodh detii hai, apane bachche kaa pet bharne ke liye
 Like humans, a cow also keeps her baby in the womb for 9 months
 vah bacchon ko thik hamaari hi tarah doodh pilaakar bada karti he
 She stops milking after the lactation period is over, just as humans do
 lekin deyari farm main jabaran paidaa kiye jane vaala doodh na sirf bejubaan pashuon ke liye khatarnaak he balki insaanon kii sehat ke liye bhi hanikaarak he
 The trade of dairy farms begins after this natural process of obtaining animal milk which is offering profits
 yahaan pashuon ko kritrim garbhaadhan bhi karaayaa jaataa he
 These methods are adopted to ensure that the milk business is always profitable
 is dauraan gaay ke bachhadon ko bhi maa se alag kar diya jaataa he
 The choice of profiteers is a very painful treatment with these calves in the female cow-dairy industry
 kai baar to deyari udyog ke karmchaaree unki berahami se pitayee bhi karte hai
 They are taken away from the mother and put in a prison, so that they do not wander around
 agar bachhda femail he to use sirf is vajah se paala jaataa he ki aage chalakar vah bhi is laabh kii bhent chadhega or mail bachade ke liye keval pashuvadh hi ekmaatr uplabdh vikalp he
 There have been many complaints - every bite of your ice cream and every glass of milk is the right of innocent calves that they never got
 udhar bachche se bichhadne ke baad shelter main ye gaae puure din ro-ro kar chillaati rahati hai
 People living in areas close to the dairy farm have also lodged a complaint with the police several times, but no way out
 4 se 5 saal main gaay kii maut-munafkhoron ke phaaydon ke liye bachche se alag hone vaali gaay amuman 4 se 5 saal main jindagi se jang haar jaati hai
 While its average age is more than 20 years
 mrityu hone ke baad inhen meet ke saudagaron ko saunp diya jaataa he
 Statistics show that 10 to 70 percent of cows are brought to the dairy farm during pregnancy
 jaahir si baat he ki is vakt unka sabase zyada phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he
 As such, the winter season brings with it a variety of health problems for people of all ages
 lekin thand kaa sabase zyada asar bacchon par padataa he
 Because viruses and bacteria attack children very fast in this season
 jis vajah se unhen sardi-zukam, naak band, saasm lene main takalif, gale main infections, viral diaria, nimonia, bukhaar jaisi samasyaayein ho jaati hai
 Therefore children need special care during winter season
 lekin aap in baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar apane bachche ko sardi ke mausam main swasth rakh sakenge
 Take care of children like this: 1
 thand se bacchon ko bachaane ke liye bahut zyada kapade ladane kii bajaay, unka talavaa, unki hatheli or unke kaan va sir dhak kar rakhen kyonki sharir ke in hisson main sabase zyada hit los hota he or yaheen se thand lagane kaa dar sabase zyada hota he
 So be sure to wear children's hats, gloves and socks
 2
 Sunlight is very important for good health
 apane bachche ko kuch der subah ke samay san bath jarur karaaen
 With this, they will get vitamin d along with fresh air
 3
 Never use room heaters around children
 kyonki heater se nikalne vaali sukhi hawa bacchon ke liye bahut nuksaandaayak hoti he
 4
 sardi ke mausam main bacchon ko rojaanaa nahalaane se bachein
 Clean their body by soaking a towel in warm water
 isse unako thand bhi nahin lagegi or wo saaf bhi ho jaaegein
 5
 bacchon ko nahalaane se pehle halke garm tel se unki maalish jarur karen
 6
 bachche aksar sote samay razaai ko hataa dete hai
 Due to which they get cold
 isliye bacchon ke sone se pehle hi unke bistar par patali garm razaai bichhaakar us par thodi der hot water bottle rakhkar unke bistar ko garm kar len or unako garm kapadon ke saath oonee juraaben or topi jarur pahana den
 So that even if the child does not wear a quilt, he will be protected from cold
 7
 If the child is more than one year old, then feed him warm fruits and vegetables according to the season
 taaja zeus bhi de sakati hai
 8
 bachche ko samay-samay par yasardi-zukamahone par steamer kii madad se steam jarur den
 9
 bachche ko sulaate samay unka cheharaa kabhi naa dhaken
 By doing this, the child's breath can be choking
 10
 Keep your baby wearing a diaper in winter and change it after a while
 isse bachche ko sardi nahin chadhegi

 laaparvaahee kaa asar is kadar he ki ek bacchee ke 4 mata-pita hone ke baavjood vah anaath ashram main rahane ko majaboor hai
 Now until the court's decision is reached, the girl will remain like an orphan in the orphanage
 maamla ahmedabad kaa he jahaan kamaljit or unki vakil patni shiba in dinon court or chaald welfare house ludhiana ke chakkar kaat rahe hai
 a lawyer by profession, Shiba and her husband Kamaljeet have a daughter of their own and they wanted that if their daughter is now grown up, then they should adopt a child so that the life of a destitute can be improved and in their own life also a child Having returned, Raunak returned
 punjab se liya bacchee ko liya godahalanki unhen nahin maaloom tha ki jis bacchee kii jindagi ko sanvaarane ke makasad se child adopashan and risource agency (CARA) kaa sahaara liya usee agency kii vajah se 11 saal kii bacchee kii jindagi main bhuuchaal aa jayega or us bacchee kii jindagi or unki khud kii jindagi main pareshaani aa jaaegi
 Kamaljeet and Siba filled out a form at the Child Adoption and Resource Agency (CARA) in July 2018 in which they preferred Ahmedabad and Punjab and Madhya Pradesh for adopting a child
 kuch dinon ke intjaar ke baad unhen phone aayaa or wo punjab se ek bacchee ko god lekar ahmedabad laut aae
 He got the girl admitted to a private school in Ahmedabad and started her education there
 mahaj 6 maheene ke andar hi bacchee ne unhen bataaya ki uske mata-pita abhi jinda hai or unhone use choda nahin he, lekin vah apane mata-pita se gum ho gai thi
 When asked, he also revealed the address of his parents
 kamaljit or uski patni shiba is khulaase se sakate main aa gaye
 The disclosure of the girl made the parents Kamaljeet and Shiba find out in this regard in Ludhiana, the information came out that the girl's parents are alive and they are working in the place where the girl told them
 khaas baat yah rahi ki bacchee balgrih main aane se pehle apane parivaar se bichad gai thi
 a few days ago, his family had also filed a complaint of the daughter's disappearance
 shikaayat darj karaae jane ke baad bhi police ne balgrih main is sambandh main na koi poochtacha kii or na hi parijanon ne aisi koi jaankaree police ko di
 Meanwhile, the family from Gujarat adopted this girl as an orphan
 duusari ore punjab main gaayab bacchee ke parijan uski talash main jute rahe
 On receiving full information, Kamaljeet and Shiba decided to hand over the adopted girl child to her relatives

 Passing the school examination with good marks, does not necessarily bring good results in the test of life
 haa, jindagi main acha karne ke liye skool janaa jaruri he
 quaid-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah was born in Karachi in 1875 and his first school was a madrasa
 saat saal kii umr main ve ek mishanri skool main bhartee hue, iske baad landan ke 'linkan in’ main padhgaye chale gaye, jahaan unhen 'jentalman student’ ke taur par bhartee kiya gaya
 He was able to become part of the bar in 1896 after four tries, but this academic setback had no effect on his confidence
 mumbai main jab unhone vakaalat kii practice shuru kii to ve logon ke bich 'brifles barrister’ ke naam se jane jate the
 At that time, Sir Charles Olivent, a law member in the Governor's Council, saw some edge in this young lawyer and he paid Jinnah Rs 1,500 in the Colonial Judicial Service
 maheene ke baari-bharkam vetan par jagah de di
 Jinnah then told him that he wanted to earn so much money in one day

 Chagla, who later also served as the foreign minister in Indira Gandhi's cabinet, used to say that Jinnah may not be a good knowledge of the law but the advocates were very good
 unke liye apana mukadmaa kanoon se kahin ahm tha
 It was this skill that he used to succeed in biting Pakistan out of this subcontinent in the fog of uncertainty and possibility between 1937 and 1947
 nae raashtra ko lekar jinna ek udaaravaadi najariya rakhte the, jiskaa rajnatik nichod britain ko ukhaad phenkna tha
 His ideals were Mustafa Kamal Ataturk, the great Turkish hero and reformer, who drove the country from the pit of Ottoman fall to an honorable position on the map of the modern world
 ataturk ne hijaab par pratibandh laga diya tha or kanoon ke sahare langik samanta laane kii koshish kii
 On this, Jinnah said in a conference of Muslim League on October 27, 1937, "I wish i had solved Mustafa Kamal had solved India's problem very easily
" afsos main vah nahin hum
 This was Jinnah's problem
 ve pakistan ko muslim bahul secular raashtra ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the, lekin is safar main unhone majahabi varchasv vaale samoohon ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Obviously, his case was more important than his law
 unki pairokari ne pakistan ko to garh diya, par uski vichaardhaara ke prati unki apekshaakrit tatasthta ne un takaton ke liye jagah chhod di jo jinna ke secular sapanom par pani pherane ko amada thi
 "the question arises whether Jinnah would have been able to live in a Pakistan or even save himself, where radical goons shot a head girl named Malala just because she wanted to go to school?" Also a school that was no more than a madrasa
 ab bharat par aate hai
 Was there corruption during Mahatma Gandhi's independence movement? The movement was formally started on August 2, 1920, when Gandhi made an unusual demand
 yah ki britain, jisane turki ko pehle vishwa yuddh main haal hi main haraaya tha, makka or madina ke paak islamic shaharon kii kaman khalipha ke haath main hi bani rahane de
 Gandhi also demanded immediate 'swaraj' for India, whose armies had supported Britain in the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire of Turkey
 isi andolan ko aaj ham asahyog andolan or khilaafat ke naam se jaanate hai
 Among Gandhi's key allies was the All India Khilafat Committee, which was headed by people like Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali, who returned from Oxford, including conservative ulema
 bharat kii janata ne isse pehle aisa koi prayog nahin dekha tha
 This movement brought hindu-muslim unity out of the comfort of conferences and brought it among the people
 apane sapanom kaa bharat banane ko betaab kuch logon ko is andolan ne jhakzor kar rakh diya
 Mahatma Gandhi was the soul of this great movement, which is why Rabindranath Tagore honored him with the title of Mahatma which was later adopted by the whole country
 is andolan ke liye paisa chande se aata tha
 The workers of the movement used to stand with their bags and throw their jewelry in the wives of the industrialists
 jo garib the, ve bhi ekaadh aana de dete
 The receipt used to be booked, but often it was not needed
 yahi ek pench tha
 Doubts arose over the funding of the movement and the inquiry committee did not take long to sit
 jaanch main paaya gaya ki khilaafat andolan ke kuch netaa fund main se apane kapadon kii dhulaai or bal kataai kaa kharch nikaalane main lage the
 It is said that a Maulana had even bought a Chevrolet car from that fund
 mumbai kaa ek kaarobaari tha, jisane 16 lakh ru
 Remove it and put it in your business
 iske ulat jab gandhi ke dwaara niyantrit kosh kii jaanch puri hui, to pataa chalaa ki aane-pai tak kaa hisaab durust
 Gandhi led the freedom movement in this country for more than two and a half decades with public donations
 unki bhi kuch kamajoriyaan thim, galtiyaan ve bhi karte the lekin inke peeche lobh kahin nahin tha
 If Gandhi were today, what would he think of a twenty-first century India, where corruption has become an epidemic, where the poison of loot has spread in public life and private enterprises? If there is a freedom to cry in heaven, then there will be a surge of salt water in the rivers there

 Let's look at the story of Gujarat in its different chapters
 gujarat kii tarakkee ko sweekaar karne main logon ko sankoch hota tha, ise 'atiranjit’ qaraar dekar khaarij kiya jaataa rahaa
 When the same story of progress was seen in the figures, nobody challenged it
 jaahir he, tathy 'atiranjit’ nahin ho sakate
 Gujarat has progressed in double digits since the Tenth Plan (2002-2007)
 bade rajyon main yahi sthiti bihar, maharashtra or tamilnadu kii he
 In the case of Bihar, it should be kept in mind that relatively large states also have difficulty in raising resources for promotion
 yadi aitihaasik karkon ne saath diya hota, to karnataka kii tarakkee or tej rahani chahie thi
 Gujarat has also overcome complaints of constant variability in growth and this shows the performance of agriculture sector there
 vahaan sadak, bijli (jyotigram yojana) or pani (nadi ghaatiyon ke bich pani kaa transfar) ke kshetra main jo kaam hua, usne aitihaasik rup se vanchit kai jilon main kai tarah kii kheti or uske vyavsaayeekaran kaa rasta kholaa
 Dairy, animal husbandry and horticulture are examples of this
 duusare, gujarat kii tarakkee kii kahani ko ab bhi galat tareeke se samaj jaataa he
 The general belief is that large industries are behind this, though the number of small factories and MSME (very small, small and medium enterprises) clusters has grown here
 rajya ke sakal gharelu utpaada main manufaccharing kii hissedari ghati he or uske barakes non-manufaccharing kshetra va seva kshetra main tarakkee hui he
 Therefore, Gujarat's growth story is more related to agriculture, MSME, non-manufacturing industry and services
 ab saamaajik kshetra par aate hai
 It is said that Gujarat did not do well in the social sector
 gramin garibi ke maamle main garibi ke anupaat main 2004-05 or 2009-10 ke bich teji se giravat ai he
 Urban poverty may not have decreased, but if rural poverty has decreased, it means that growth has been inclusive
 aisa koi saboot bhi nahin jo yah bataae ki yahaan asamanta badi he
 The timeline of statistics in social sectors is important because special emphasis on social sector started in the Eleventh Plan (2007-12)
 gujarat ne saamaajik kshetron main bhale badhibia pradarshan na kiya ho, lekin sawaal he ki kya samay ke saath maamuli sudhaar bhi hue hai or kya samaadhaan ke upaay kiye gaye hai? ek udhaaharan len, masalan 2006 se 2011 ke bich skool se bich main padhai chhod dene vaale bacchon kii sankhya main teji se giravat ai he
 55 of 2003-04 rate of delivery under medical supervision in the field of health
 87 fisadi se bad kar 2011-12 main 93
 5 percent
 tikaakaran kaa kawarej badha he
 Extremist violence has been curbed
 udyogikaran, rifinary or tatavarti kshetra kendrit vikaas par jor ke baavjood tatavarti kshetron main yaa kahin bhi koi bada haadasa nahin hua he
 Despite this, people believe that the progress in the case of Gujarat is hesitant, hardly anyone considers the story of development and no one trusts the administrative success
 ab jaraa gujarat ke prashasnic paksh ko bhi dekh len
 This chapter of the story is partly based on financial management and bridging deficiencies in central and centrally sponsored schemes with state level schemes
 yahaan maamla sarkari kharch ko badhaane kaa nahin he, balki privet investment ke liye maahaul paidaa karne kaa zyada he
 You can see the signs of breakdown of traditional government monopoly in both education and health
 iske alaava sarkari kharch ko asardaar bananaa prashasan kaa ek pahalu he
 It also includes an important component of e-governance, with the help of which government arbitrariness has been overcome
 2003 ke baad chale chintan shiviron ke jariye yah sunishchit kiya gaya ki sarkaar kaa kaam vibhaagon kii bhulbhulaiya main na fansaa rahe, balki yojanaon ke behatar kriyanvayan ke liye tamaam hnetron se vichaar liya jaae
 Now transfer, posting and planning implementation are largely free from political interference
 gujarat main prashasan kii kahani vikaas kii ek maanak ibaarat he jo duusare rajyon ke liye anukaraniya he
 It is always difficult to assess separately the elements that ensure this story of progress, development and administration
 phir bhi ham kah sakate hai ki awwal to gujarat ke saath ek viraasat judi hui he chunki 2002 se pehle kii sabhi sarkaron ne sakaaratmak asar hi choda tha
 Secondly, Gujarat has a healthy tradition of private entrepreneurship and criticism of the government
 tisare, pani or sadak parivahan jaise kshetron ke maamle main gujarat ko hameshaa bahari duniya se sampark kaa laabh miltaa rahaa he
 Automobile and auto sector components factories in the state are an example of this
 rajya kii vikaas kii parampara or viraasat ke bare main itnaa kuch ginane ke baad narendra modi ke netritv kii bhoomika ko aap nakaar nahin sakate
 The personal seal of his leadership, which include the emphasis on the social sector, the empowerment of bureaucracy, its freedom from political interference, a close watch on corruption, decentralization, emphasis on the private sector and a message of self-respect in the growth and development of Gujarat
 There are some important things

 Skipper Virat Kohli has relied on second-ranked bowler Yajuvendra Chahal in the ICC World Cup first semi-final against New Zealand, ousting Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav in the final XI
 world cap ke is behad ahm mukaable main kohli kaa yah faisla thodaa chaunkaane vaala rahaa kyonki chahal kii jagah kuldeep kaa iconomi rate zyada badhiya he or unhone ran dene ke maamle main kanjusee dikhaai he
 However, in terms of taking wickets, Yajuvendra Chahal has performed better than Kuldeep and has taken 11 wickets in 7 matches while young spinner Kuldeep Yadav has taken just 6 wickets in 7 matches of the World Cup before the semi-final match
 chahal zyada mahangeiconomi rate kii baat karen to chahal ab tak kuldeep yadav se zyada mahange gendbaaj sabit hue hai
 Kuldeep gave runs at an average of over 7 in 1 match out of 7 matches played in the World Cup
 jabaki 4 maichon main unki gendbaaji kaa iconomi rate 5 ran prati over se kam rahaa
 In these 7 matches, he put the entire 10 overs of his quota 4 times while 9 of the quota 3 times
 vahiin yajuvendra chahal kii gendbaaji ke iconomi rate par najar daalen to 7 main se sirf 1 match main hi unka iconomi rate 5 se kam rahi he jabaki 6 maichon main unka iconomi rate 5 yaa usase zyada kaa rahaa
 He scored 8 in the match against England
 80 ke rate se ran lutaae the
 7 in the match against Pakistan
 57 kii ausat se ran die
 Kuldeep is backward in terms of wickets, though Kuldeep is behind Chahal in terms of wickets
 7 main se 2 maichon ko chhod diya jaae to unhone har match main kam se kam 1 wicket liya jarur he
 Chahal has also taken wickets in 5 out of 7 matches before the semi-finals
 inamen ek baar to 4 wicket or 3 baar 2-2 wicket nikaale hai
 Chahal bowled a total of 64 overs in the World Cup before the semi-finals in which he did not put a single maiden and spent 369 runs
 vahiin kuldeep ne kul 67 overon main mahaj 337 ran hi die or 2 over madan bhi daale
 The reason for the selection, however, was that Kuldeep Yadav lagged behind Chahal in terms of wicket-taking and that is perhaps why he did not become captain Kohli's first choice of the final 11 players in this crucial match
 duusari ore chahal kii gendbaaji kii khaasiyat yah he ki unhone apane vanade kariyar main jab bhi 2 yaa 2 se zyada wicket jatke hai to jeet bharat ke khate main gai he
 Perhaps thinking that this record has kept Kohli in this match, now it is to see whether Chahal can get Team India ticket for the final by taking 2 or more wickets in this match

 Hello, i Ravish Kumar


 The voter is formless like God, but his name and his words are different like gods
 lekin in sab main ek catagori aisi he, jiske bare main netaaon ko pataa nahin kaise lagata he ki usamen jati, dharm or varg ke bhed nahin hai
 The name of this category is a female voter
 kya hamaari raajnneeti mahila voter se barabari se samvaad karti he yaa upadesh aashirwad dene kaa lahaza hi haaavee rahata he
 The next time the picture of rallies comes on TV, watch it carefully
 auraton alag baithi hai or mard alag
 This does not happen in cinema halls where it is dark but why in rallies? dilli main nibharya cond ke vakt hamaari raajnneeti ko auraton kii raajnneetik dalon se alag aawaaj ke dabaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Suddenly, these leaders, moving from big cars to arms, started being feminist in front of the camera
 is andolan kaa ek sabase bada phayda hua ki auraton kii suraksha kaa sawaal maujuuda raajnneeti ke bade sawaalon main se ek ban gaya
 But there was another loss, all the questions of women were pushed back in the name of security
 sankhya yani bhagidaari ke sawaal se netaaon ko bachane kaa mauka mil gaya
 In the selection of women candidates, these political parties also have the same scale that is used in advertisements for TV serial and Tel Masala
 mahilaon ko tikat dena hota he, to cinema-siriyal se lekar rajshahi khandaanon ke khandhiron se nikaal laate hai
 Look at the structure of all the political parties
 mahila kyrkarta kaise shuru se alag rakhi jaati he
 Women's front is just a place to keep them marginalized
 aaj-kal aapane tivi par narendra modi or rahul gandhi ko auraton se alag se samvaad karte hue dekha hoga
 Rahul Gandhi calls in his fence and his dreams begin to fade
 unase ghir kar nae jamaane ke netaa dikhne lagate hai
 Narendra Modi talks to women at several locations to discuss tea on Women's Day
 in donon ke video footage ko utub par jaakar phir se dekhiegaa or inhen netaaon ko manch par se bhaashan dete hue video se milan kijiyegaa
 On the stage, they are only and only men, from their language to their expressions
 aae din mardaana shabdaawalee se navaaje jate hai, lekin jab auraton ke bich aate hai inke kandhe jhuke hote hai, chehre par muskaan hoti he or puraa maahaul saumy hota he
 This change is only dramatic or an easy technique to influence women by understanding this
 kya unki deh bhashaa auraton ke saath barabari se pesh aati he yaa khud ko unhen daan dene ke andaaj main pesh karti he
 As if you have come to not be fascinated to address them
 phir bhi kya hamaare netaa auraton kii bhagidaari ke sawaal par eemaandaar hai
 In the sixties, there were 715 women in a thousand voters and today there are 803
 upi vidhansabha chunaavon main 60
 29 percent of the women had voted
 jo purushon se adhik tha
 Women are overtaking men in voting, but they lag behind in sex ratio
 12 sitambar 1996 ko mahila aarakshan bill sansad main pesh hua tha
 Till date it could not be passed in Lok Sabha, while this bill was passed in Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010
 tamaam raajnneetik dal panchayaton se lekar nigamon tak main mahilaon ke aarakshan ko shandaar kamyaabi kii tarah pesh karte hai, magar sansad or vidhansabha ke naam par aakar aarope pratyarope main bahes ulajhaa dete hai
 Why is the women's front of our political parties activated in demonstrating against inflation
 kahin hamaare raajnneetik dal auraton ko raajnneeti main bhi gharelu aurat kii tarah to sthapit nahin karte
 If he wanted, he could give tickets to a large number of women candidates
 kyrkarta bana sakate the
 Could campaign
 inter parliamentry union kii report bataati he ki auraton ke sawaalon par gambhir hamaare raajnneetik dalon kaa pradarshan itnaa kharaab kyon hai? is naakaami main sabaki bhagidaari rahi he
 How do we call India as the world's largest democracy without women's participation
 khayr 2013 kii report ke anusaar sansadeey loktantr main bhagidaari dene ke sawaal par bharat kaa sthaan 108 waan hai
 Pakistan is far ahead of India in this matter, being 66th and Nepal in 24th place
 543 saansadon main se sirf 60 mahila saansad hai
 Of all the new voters this time, 18 to 19 years, 41 percent are girls
 vah apni bhagidaari ke sawaal ko kaise dekhati hai? vah apni mahila matadaata kii pahchaan ko kis najariye se dekhati hai? suraksha ke naam par bhagidaari ke sawaal se kyon bachate hai hamaare netaa?

 However, it is so important that after the first kidnapping and killing of four foreign tourists in the Pahalgam area of kashmir Valley in 1994, the investigating agency linked the murder to the conspiracy of a global terrorist organization, because then an organization named Al Furan, Took responsibility for the murder
 haalanki naa hi tab or naa hi ab tak al faraan sanghathan kaa naam kisi aatanki sajeesh main paaya gaya, lekin isi maheene kuch din pehle hi na sirf jammu-kashmir or desh kii suraksha agenciyaan chaukanna ho gayi, balki kai saare videshi suraksha sanghathan bhi harakat main aa gaye
 Al Qaeda for the first time brought out the name of Zakir Musa as its first commander for Jihad against Hindustan
 jakirmusako alqaida ne gajvaa-e-hind kaa pramukh banaaya
 Who is Zakir Musasaal In 2014, like many stray youths, Zakir Musa went on a terrorist rampage in Bhikashmir, which is called the new batch of terrorists in Kashmir
 dakshini kashmir ke traal ilaake kaa rahane vaala jakir shafi bhatta hijbul ke poster bvoy burhan vaani kaa dost tha or usee ke jariye aatankwaad main shaamil hua chandigarh ke ek ejineering college main beatech kii padhai chhodkar jakir burhan brigade kaa ek hissaa bana
 On July 8 last year, Zakir Musa became Burhan's life after Burhan Wani was killed in Kokernag area of southern Kashmir
 hijbul mujahidin ne jakir musa ko dakshini kashmir kaa commander banaaya or vah burhan vaani ke nakshe kadam par chalate hue aae din soshal media par apane video massej jari karata gaya, lekin do maah pehle may ke maheene menzakir musake ek bayaan ne sabko chaunkaa diya, jab usne kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaaon ko laal chowk main faansee par latakaane kii baat kahi or seemaa paar pakistan main rah rahe aatanki cmanderon ko dhamkaaya
 This statement by Zakir Musa fueled Hizbul Mujahideen chief Saeed Salahuddin and removed Zakir Musa and made another militant Riyaz Nayak a Hizbul commander in southern Kashmir, but in the meantime, many terrorists of not only Hizbul in support of Zakir Musa in Kashmir Many Zakirs came to support Moses, but also among the common people
 uski misaal un pradarshnon main saaf dekhi gai, jahaan aksar 'musa musa jakir musa' ke naare lage
 But the big turn came last week when Al Qaeda appointed Zakir Musa as the commander of Al Qaeda
 suraksha agenciyon ko is baat kii jaankaree bhi thi ki kashmir ke alag-alag ilaakon main kai jehadi abhi bhi jakir musa ko hi apana amir maan rahe hai
 Even when a conversation between two Lashkar terrorists killed last month came to the hands of the security forces, the two Lashkar terrorists talked to Zakir Musa before he died
 yahaan tak kii mangalvaar ko dakshini kashmir ke pulavama jile main maare gaye lashkar commander abu dujana ke bare main kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah jakir musa ke saath hi kaam karata tha or usee ke samprag main tha
 There was a lot of rhetoric between Hizbul Mujahideen and the group of Zakir Musa emanating from Kashmir, but Zakir Musa slowly built his own land in Kashmir
 desh main suraksha agenciyon ne jakir musa ko mostwanted list main pehle hi rakhaa he or uske jinda yaa murda pakadaney ke liye 15 lakh kaa inaam bhi jari kiya he
 After becoming commander of Al Qaeda, on Thursday, Zakir Musa posted the first picture on social media, in which he is not alone, but eight more terrorists are seen with him
 yah saaf darshata he ki jakir musa akelaa nahin, balki kashmir main vah alqaida kii soch kaa ek bada group kaayam karne main safal ho chukaa he, jo kahin naa kahin kashmir ke saath-saath desh kii suraksha agenciyon ke liye bhi chintaa kaa vishay he, kyonki jakir musa kashmir ke saath-saath desh ke alag-alag hisson se bhi yuvaaon ko aakarshith kar rahaa he or kai saare yuvaaon ke sampark main bhi he

 The names of the real culprits of the murder are not in the charge sheet
 ummid he ki sajeesh rachane waalon ko sakht sajaa milegi
 Ishrat's sister Mushrat told that her sister was in the BSC second year at the time of the murder
 2002 main pita kii maut ke baad parivaar main vahi thi jo do vakt kii roti ke liye paise kama rahi thi
 Due to the stain on the family, his sisters could not get married and the brother did not get a job

 dilli hoicourt nelive-in-relationke rishton ko bhartiya dand samhita ke tahat balaatkaar ke daayre se baahar rakhane se inkaar kar diya he
 The High Court said that doing so would mean the relationship would get marital status, which the legislature has not opted for
 chif jaj rohinee or nyaayamurti rajeev sahay andlau kii khandpeeth ne kaha ki jahaan tak liv-in-relation ke rishton ko bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 376 (balaatkaar) ke daayre se baahar rakhane kaa sawaal he to aisa karne kaa matlab liv-in-relation ko vaivaahik darja praapt karnaa hoga or vidhayika ne aisa nahin karne kaa chayan kiya he
 The court held that the relationship of live-in-relation is a class beyond marriage
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aise maamalon main aaropee ko sahmati ke aadhaar par bachaav uplabdh nahin hoga
 We do not see any merit in the petition and hence it is dismissed

 bollywood kii kisi ection thriller kii tarah ladi police officer kaa burka pahan kar jue ke adde (gambling den) par chapa maarna
 
 
 Simultaneously just a sub inspector in plain dress and
 
 
 adde par 28 hardkor juaari maujuud
 
 
 In such a situation, fear of anything happening to the police officer
 
 
 hamalaa hone par jaan jane kaa bhi jokhim
 This is not the story of any film, but the reality of Monday night in Ahmedabad
 jis diler police officer ne ise anjaam diya unka naam he disipi manjita vanjaaraa
 It was very difficult for the police to reach the Isanpur area of the city in which the gambling base was being run
 sankari galiyaan
 Now in which street to raid in which house, it was also difficult to decide
 kaaphi samay se chal rahaa tha juapulice ko ye soochna mili thi ki isanpur main masjid ke paas gali ke ek ghar main mohammad urf sheru or nasir khan pathan kaaphi samay se jua khilaa rahe hai
 Having full faith in Manjita Vanjara, the senior officers gave her the responsibility to carry out this operation
 lekin jis ilaake main jua chal rahaa tha, vahaan police ke pahunchane kii pehle se hi jaraa bhi bhanak mil jaati to juaari vahaan se bina koi saboot chode faraar ho jate
 Therefore, the strategy was that Manjita Vanjara be sent to the burqa
 sade kapadon main saath tha ek inspectorunake saath sade kapadon main ek sab inspector ko bhi bheja jaae
 The police team was also fully alert for backup
 jaise hi manjita ishaara kare vaise hi police team vahaan pahunch jaae
 Such was the occasion at the gambling base when Manjita Vanjara stood alone there, challenging 28 gamblers
 baaki police team ko vahaan pahunchane main kuch vakt laga
 But Manjita Vanjara faced the situation by showing full courage
 maukey se 28 juaariyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 1 lakh 14 thousand rupees were also seized along with gambling paraphernalia
 manjita vanjaaraa ne india today group se kii baatcheetmanjita vanjaaraa se 'aaj tak / india today' ne is puure oparation par baat kii
 Manjita said that the duty that was assigned to her was done by her
 manjita ke anusaar wo khud ko ek police officer maanati hai, isliye isamen ladi police officer kii vajah se khaas karne jaisi koi baat nahin
 Manjita said that she was wearing a burqa in the area for two hours before the gambling gambling operation
 wo or unke saathi sab inspector aisa hi naatak karte rahe ki jaise kisi apane khoe hue rishtedaar ko dhund rahe hon
 People were staring with suspicion, but still seeing them there for the first time, many eyes stared at them with suspicion
 manjita ke mutabik is karrwai main jokhim tha lekin police officers ko har sthiti se nipatane kii training hoti he
 Manjita said that she was confident that there was a backup team behind her
 manjita ne hansate hue kaha ki un sankari galiyon main machharon kii bharmaar ne unhen jarur pareshaan kiya
 Manjita Vanjara, posted in Ahmedabad's f Division, has already carried out many such operations, including the revelations of the sex racket
 2013 main paas kii thi UPSC parikshijineering kii padhai puri karne ke baad manjita police sarvice main ain

 Film Name: Julie 2 Director: Deepak Shivdasanistar Cast: Rai Laxmi, Pankaj Tripathi, Ravi Kishan, Aditya Srivastava Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes Certificates: a Rating: 1
 5 star2004 main diarector deepak shivadaasaani ne juli banaai thi
 Neha Dhupia was seen in the lead role in this film
 ab 13 saal baad unhone juli 2 banaai he
 Has this film become like what Neha did 13 years ago? To know this, let's read the review of the film
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani juli (raay lakshmi) kii he
 She lives with her mother in a family where she also has a stepfather
 ek nazaij aulad he jiskaa pataa use baad main chalata he
 Julie has taken an acting and dance course
 lekin uske paas kaam nahin he
 When she goes in search of work, the producers-directors look at her with a second look
 uski jindagi main alag-alag logon kii entry hoti he
 Meanwhile, she reaches out to Christian woman Anne
 use kaam milanaa shuru ho jaataa he
 But after a time, he has no work again
 tab use samjhaute karne padate hai
 She tries to meet people of different ways
 is dauraan bahut saare twist or terns dekhne ko milte hai
 With this, the story of the film moves forward
 aakhirkaar kahani main ek bada twist aata he jab juli ek maharani kii byopic film 'devi' karne ke liye jaati he
 Many secrets are exposed
 jo maharani he uski deth hoti he
 Her husband is Pankaj Tripathi
 kahani main kis tarah pankaj treepathi, ravi kishan or nishikant kaamat kii entry hoti he ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Review: Ajji avenges the rape of granddaughter, shakes up the story of why the story of the film is boring
 ghisi-pity kahani he
 a lot of the Revenge drama has been created, but Julie 2 is a very weak story
 aapako pataa hota he ki agle pal kya hone vaala he
 It is a thriller but it does not look like a thriller
 kareeb sava do ghante kii film 3 ghante se bhi zyada badi lagati he
 The songs in the film are also very big
 gaanon ko chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 Editing could be more agile
 film kii kahani behatar banaai ja sakati thi
 Longer shots could be shortened
 kahani par kaam kiya janaa jaruri tha, jisaki kami film dekhte saafe samaj aati he
 Rai Lakshmi has intercepted dialogue in Hindi film
 yah thodaa atapata he
 The story of the film sometimes goes towards the love angle, sometimes towards the revenge drama and sometimes towards emotion
 kahani main kai sire hai jo bhatke hue hai
 Review: Sanjay Mishra's brilliant performance in the bitter air, will be remembered to see why if you are very fond of erotic films and you liked Julie the first one then you can see it
 kirdaaron kii baat karen to pankaj treepathi, ravi kishan kaa kaam kaaphi jancha he
 The work of Rai Lakshmi and Nishikant is also fine
 rati agnihotri ne badhiya kaam kiya he
 The film is fine in terms of acting
 lekin kahani boring he
 Why people will go to watch such a film with money is a matter of thinking
 film ko edlt certificate mila he
 If you are an adult, then only go to the theater to watch a movie
 yaa tivi par film ke aane kaa intazaar karen
 The budget budget is around 9-10 crores
 box offis par film ko apni kamai nikaal paane main mushkil ho sakati he
 The film could have been made better
 box offis par film kitna kama paaegi, yah dekh paanaa mushkil hoga

 Swati Singh, wife of Dayashankar Singh, who was expelled from the BJP for 6 years, came to the spotlight overnight due to the way the BSP made a ruckus on the objectionable statements made against her and her daughter
 lekin kam hi log jaanate honge ki mahilaon ke sammaan kii baat karne vaali swati khud mahila utpeedan ke maamle main aaropee hai
 Swati's ability to take the iron affected the BJP so much that she was being discussed to contest elections instead of her husband
 darasal, swati singh par bhabhi ke saath marpet karne, bina talaak liye bhai kii duusari shaadi karaane or bhabhi ko ghar se nikaalane kaa aarope he
 a case of assault, abuse and domestic violence has been registered against Swati against her own sister-in-law at Ashiana police station in Lucknow
 swati ke khilaaf bhabhi ne darj karaayaa tha kesaswati ke khilaaf mukadmaa unke apane sage bhai kii patni aashaa singh ne darj karaayaa
 This case is about 11 years old
 2008 main aashaa singh ne lakhanu ke ashiana thane main apni nanad swati ke khilaaf pati kii duusari shaadi karaane kaa ye maamla darj kara rakhaa tha
 There is no dispute between Dayashankar and Swati, Swati and Dayashankar Singh have also had a bad relationship
 2008 main swati ne pati ke khilaaf marpet kii shikaayat kii thi
 At that time the divorce had reached a divorce, but for the time being both sides are trying to reconcile for some time
 swati singh aaj bhi apane maayke main rahati hai jabaki dayashankar singh apni maa ke saath
 In this case, both families are not saying anything at the moment, but now Swati may find it difficult to answer this matter
 'aaj tak' par swati singh kii safayeeswati singh ke khilaaf gharelu hinsa maamla saamne aane ke baad swati singh or unke bhai punit singh ne 'aaj tak' par apni safai di
 Swati said that this is the case of 2005 when she used to live in her maternal house due to being pregnant, then there is a fight between her brother and sister-in-law in which her sister-in-law filed a dowry harassment case against her brother and the whole family
 
 swati kii maane to us vakt wo vahaan rahati thi isliye puure parivaar ke saath unka naam bhi cese main daal diya tha
 But later his name was removed during the hearing, so he has no case registered now
 pati-patni ke bich khatas se swati kaa inkaariske alaava apane pati dayashankar singh ke saath anban or talaak kii ai naubat par bhi safai dete hue swati ne kaha ki donon ke bich anban thi, lekin ye vaise hi tha jaise pati-patni ke bich hota he, lekin donon main kuch maheene pehle sulah ho chuki he or ab sab thik he
 Swati's brother Puneet said that the court battle is going on with the wife and the matter has not been settled yet
 bijepi ne bataaya nijee maamalalakhanu espi ke mutabik ye maamla philhal unke sangyaan main nahin he
 Since the case is about 11 years old, a response can be given only after a thorough investigation
 bijepi ise dayashankar singh kaa paariwarik or nijee maamla bataa rahi he lekin utpeedan ke aaropon ke baad bhi bijepi philhal swati singh ke saath majbootee se khadi nazar aa rahi he
 On 3 August 2015, a message was sent to all media organizations from the Government of India stating that a very big announcement is expected
 iske kuch der baad hi bharat sarkaar or neshnal socialist council of nagaland (ijac-muiva) yaa NSCN (IM) ke bich aitihaasik ‘fremawork samjhaute’ kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 This announcement not only aroused a ray of hope in Nagaabadi but it was also welcomed in other parts of the country
 logon ne samajha ki desh ke ek hisse main sabase lambey samay se chali aa rahi gadabadi vaali gatividhiyon par isse viraam lag sakegaa
 More than three years have passed since the declaration of the 'frameworm Agreement'
 ‘fremawork samjhaute’ main kya kya likhaa gaya tha wo saarvajanik taur par uplabdh nahin he
 People do not have any idea about the progress made in this regard
 beete maheene, grih mantralay ne sansad kii ek sthai samiti ko uttar purv ke rajyon kii sthiti ko lekar ek report saunpi gai thi
 The report said that NSCN-IM is ready for settlement with 'special status' within the Indian Union
 NSCN- IM nagaland kii seemaa kaa vistaar chahta he jisamen assam, manipur or arunachal pradesh jaise padosi rajyon ke naga prabhaav vaale ilaakon ko bhi saath jodna chahta he
 RN Ravi, who is playing the role of negotiator from the Naga organization, told the committee that the Nagas have now reached a joint consensus with the government that 'the borders of the states will not be touched' and that the Nagas will make special arrangements for them wherever they are Will go '
 indian expreski 26 april 2018 kii report ke mutabik centre sarkaar or naga sashastr samooh ke bich shanti samjhaute ke moolbhoot hisse ko antim rup de diya gaya he
 According to this report, only one obstacle is coming and that is to demand a separate flag from Naga for the state
 report main centre ke vaartakar ravi ke agast 2015 main die us bayaan kaa bhi hawala diya gaya he jisamen kaha gaya, “haa, ham (naga shanti) samjhaute ko antim rup dene ke bahut najadik pahunch gaye hai”
 Three years later, according to a report published in 'the Hindu' on 22 July 2018, the Naga peace deal is almost ready but the government has yet to take a decision on the signatories
 spasht taur par is baat ko lekar bhram he ki naga samoohon kii ore se samjhaute par koun hastakshar karegaa or is par faisla lene main kuch samay lag saktaa he
 India Today filed a petition under the Right to Information (RTI) in the Ministry of Home Affairs to clarify the situation amidst all these modifications
 sawaalon kii pehali kadi ke tahat hamane sarkaar se poocha- sarkaar ne naga samoohon ke saath vaarta kii shuruyaat kab kii thi? kis samooh se vaarta kii ja rahi he? vaarta par kitna paisa kharch kiya ja chukaa he or sarkaar kii ore se in naga samoohon ko kya suvidhaayen di ja rahi hai?sarkaar kii ore se jo pratikriya mili usamen aisi koi bhi jaankaree dene se saaf inkaar kiya gaya
 In response, it said- 'information sought by you is very sensitive and sharing information on it will be detrimental to national security interests'
 sawaalon kii duusari kadi main hamane ‘fremawork samjhaute’ ke ahm binduon ke bare main poocha
 We also asked whether NSCN-IM has been ready for settlement with 'special status' within the Indian Union
 And has it also been prepared because the boundaries of any state will neither be changed nor disturbed? The Ministry of Home Affairs responded - 'it is informed that political negotiations with Naga underground groups are not yet complete
 aise main purvakalik jaankaree dena shanti prakriya ke liye nuksaandeh ho saktaa he’
 The government does not want to share any information
 jabaki unamem se kuch pehle se hi saarvajanik domen main hai
 The government shared some information with the Standing Committee of Parliament but at the same time admitted that the negotiations were still going on
 
 
 aisi surat aitihaasik fremawork samjhaute kii ghoshnaa ke teen saal baad puraa hone ke baad he
 It is but natural that some stories and theories are floating in this regard and the government is neither officially accepting nor rejecting anything
 sarkaar bas yahi kah rahi he ki baatcheet abhi puri nahin hui he
 But generally those whose sides are involved in this dialogue or who are closely watching the Naga issue are now more ambiguous than even before the declaration of the 'framework Agreement'
 ab sabase bada sawaal he ki sarkaar kab tak sanshay kii sthiti bani rahane degi? or aise hi chizon ko latake rahane dene se sabase zyada laabh kiskaa he- naga logon kaa? naga netaaon kaa? yamodi sarkaarka? The political journey of Madhu Koda, the five-phase assembly elections in Jharkhand, in 2006 in the politics of Jharkhand, from the laborer to CM Takhar, there is such a political upsurge and overnight an independent MLA sits on the Chief Minister's chair

 Madhu Koda was sworn in as the fifth Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 18 September 2006 and remained till 27 August 2008
 is tarah madhu kodaa ne mukhyamantri ke rup main 23 maheene tak kaa kaarykaal puraa kiya

 ajasu se shuru kii siyaasi parimadhu kodaa ke raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat ol jharkhand student union(ajasu) ke saath chaatr raajnneeti se hui

 While working in the RSS, he was identified with Babulal Marandi, the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand
 yaheen se kodaa ko raajnneetik pahchaan mili or phir unhone palatakar nahin dekha
 Marandi contested Koda for the first time in the year 2000 on the BJP ticket from Jagannathpur Assembly seat
 kodaa jite or vidhayak bane
 Madhu Koda became the panchayati raj minister in the government under Marandi's leadership
 iske baad 2003 main arjuna munda sarkaar main bhi mantri rahe
 In the 2005 assembly elections of Jharkhand, BJP cut Madhu Koda's ticket, after which he rebelled from the party and went to the Independent Election ground and won once again elected MLA
 2005 main bijepi se baghawat nirdaleey vidhayak banesaal 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila, iske baad arjuna munda ke netritv main banane vaali bijepi sarkaar ko madhu kodaa ne samarthan diya or khanan mantri bane
 However, he soon lost his relationship with Arjun Munda
 congress or jeemem ne maukey ke siyaasi mizaaj ko samajhate hue madhu kodaa ko apane kheme main milaayaa
 Madhu Koda then took three other independent mlas into his trust and withdrew support from the BJP government
 iske chalate arjuna manda ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar gir gai
 Madhu Koda claimed to form the government in the year 2006
 kodaa sarkaar main jeemes, argedy, united gomantak democratic party, ensipi, farward block aup teen nirdaleey vidhayak shaamil hue
 Whereas, Congress supported from outside
 madhu kodaa ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad bhi khanan vibhaag, urja sahit anya mahatvapurn vibhaag apane paas rakhaa tha
 a person named Vinod Sinha came into the limelight when Dagamadhu Koda became the chief minister of Madhu Koda
 iske baad iskar vibhaag ne kodaa, vinod va usase jude deshbhar ke 167 sthanon par chhapemari kii or kodaa ke kaarykaal main koyala, aayran or khadaan aavanton or urja vibhaag main kaary aavanton main bhrashtachar kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha
 After this, the investigating agencies became active and a case was registered against Koda and others
 iske chalate congress ne madhu kodaa sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya, jiske baad madhu kodaa ko siem pad se hataakar jeemem pramukh shibu sorain ne satta kii kaman sanbhali or mukhyamantri bane
 The Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate (ED) tightened its grip against Madhu Koda
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki november 2009 ko pravartan nideshaalay ne kodaa ko giraftaar kar liya
 He remained in jail for more than three years
 haalanki madhu kodaa ne 2009 main jharkhand kii chibasa seat se lade or jitkar vidhayak bane
 The Election Commission had received complaints that Koda did not give the exact details of election expenses
 iske baad sitambar 2017 main chunaav ayog teen saal ke liye madhu kodaa ko chunaav ladane par roak laga di he
 As a result, Madhu Koda is out of the election field this time
 jabaki, wo jagannathpur seat se congress ke tikat par vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate the

 Putus, a second class student of primary school Noni of Meskaur block in Nawada district, does not know
 chauthi class kaa vijay ab bhi chah kaa pahaada rat rahaa he, jabaki paanchavin ke raju ko angreji varnmaala kaa gyaan nahin he
 He says, "I study every day, but forget
" '' yah sthiti chand bacchon kii nahin he, skool ke aadhe se adhik bacchon kii sthiti kuch aisi hi he
 It is not that children are not studying or are careless
 har roj class hoti he or bachche maujuud rahete hai
 But what is not happening is to study correctly
 primary skool noni ke teacher prem kumaar kehete hai, ''bacchon kii padhai ke liye maine alag se koi profeshnal course nahin kiya he, balki bachapan main ghar-parivaar se jo padhaane kaa tarika siikhaa tha, usee aadhaar par bacchon ko padhaane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 "that way Majra should be understood
" is skool main 223 bachche hai, jinhen padhaane ke liye do hi teacher hai or unki bhi training nahin hui he
 Children are not at all responsible for this condition of education
 Take the development of Singhatola Bagahi Middle School in Hathua block of Gopalganj district
 vah chauthi class main he, lekin vah apni hi class kii kitaab sahi se nahin pard paata he
 Nakula of Mohabatpur Middle School in Sheikhpura district studies in VIII, but he can hardly write his name in English
 yah sthiti kasbaai skulon ke bacchon kii hi nahin he
 The situation in the practice middle school of Nawada district headquarters is also similar
 paanchavin kaa sudhir apana naam angreji main likh saktaa he, lekin gaanv kaa naam basodih nahin
 Amit is in eighth, but cannot write the name of his father Surendra Sharma in English
 acchhee shiksha milane par yahi bachche afasar or vaigyanik banane kaa dam rakhte hai
 Where is the root of this problem? This is a subject of intense study
 lagata he ki bacchon ko sahi tareeke se shiksha dene kii koshish nahin ho rahi hai
 According to government data, 8 in the country
 1 lakh antrend teacher hai, jinamein 1,73,167 akele bihar main hai
 Take, for example, Singhatola Bagahi Middle School in Gopalganj
 yahaan nau teacher hai, jinamein se chah antrend hai
 Actually, most of the trend teachers are old
 adhikansh nae teacher patrachaar course ke jariye trend hue hai
 Although the government conducts training programs, nothing is more than formality
 indira gandhi open uniwarsity ke shaikshanik paramarshdaata arun kumaar bhi basic training or patrachaar course ke jariye training main antar maanate hai
 Although practical training is provided to bridge the gap, most teachers do not show interest
 haalanki sarkaar bhi is baat se waakif he
 In a seminar in Patna recently, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, "there is a need to make teachers aware of new ways of teaching and to give training from time to time
 chunki bacchon ko skulon main daravaaje band karke nahin roka ja saktaa
 The problem is also the lack of teachers
 rajya main 6
 33 lakh teachers are needed, compared to 3
 48 lakh teacher hi hai
 In 2012, about one lakh two lakh teachers are being reinstated, of which most of the candidates are untrained
 rajya sarkaar ne trend teachers kii upasthiti badhaane ke liye adhiktam aayu seemaa main 10 saal kii chhot di he
 But few teachers will get the benefit of this
 bihar ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri pi
 K
 shahi ke mutabik, ''2020 tak kareeb 10 lakh shikshakon kii jarurat hogi
 Therefore, the need is to trend millions of teachers, but resources are limited
 ''darasal, 1992 se teacher kii jwining main trend rahane kii anivaaryta hataa die jane se samasya badi he
 However, the state government has planned to trend teachers with the help of World Bank
 haalanki yah sab abhi prakriya main he or lanbaa safar tay kiya janaa he
 In such a situation, the way to appoint trend teachers will not be easy

 com / ukmnd3wnsp — Abdul Qadir (@imaqadir) January 15, 2017 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav se pehle shivasena or bijepi ke bich jubaani jang jari he
 Reversing the statement of BJP President Amit Shah, the Shiv Sena said that it is clear from the BJP chief's statement on the pre-poll alliance that he is not much interested in working with people who believe in Hindutva
 bijepi ko iviem par zyada bharosa
 Therefore, Shiv Sena is ready to contest elections alone
 endie kii sabase puraane sahyogi shivasena ne saaf kar diya he ki bijepi kaa rukh acha nahin he
 Let me tell you that on Sunday, Amit Shah did not directly name the Shiv Sena in Latur, Maharashtra, warned that if there is an alliance, the party will ensure the victory of its allies and if it does not, then in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections Will beat his former colleagues hard
 shivasenaane shah ke is bayaan par palatwaar karne main deree nahin kii
 Shiv Sena said that this provocative statement of Amit Shah has brought out the thinking of him and the party
 shivasena pramukh ne is desh ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko 'pehle mandir fir sarkaar' kahkar vyakt kiya tha, lekin us bayaan ne bijepi ko zamin se dur kar diya tha or ab unki jubaan phisal rahi he
 It seems that the BJP does not want people who believe in Hindutva
 shivasena ne kaha ki paanch rajyon ke parinaam se saaf he ki desh ke log unako unki jagah dikhaanaa shuru kar die hai
 The claim of winning at least 40 seats has made it clear that he is going to combine with evms
 maharashtra main bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar shivasena anishchit rahi he
 Explain that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has given BJP workers the target of winning 40 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 unke is bayaan par bhi shivasena ne palatwaar kiya
 Earlier, Amit Shah addressed the booth level workers of BJP in Marathwada
 is dauraan bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki party kaaryakartaaon ko gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ke bhram se dur rahanaa chahie
 If the allies come with us, we will ensure their victory, otherwise we will beat them
 party kaaryakartaaon ko har booth par taiyaari karnaa chahie
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has targeted the central government, saying that turning the country into a 'police raj' will not solve Modi's problems
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki isse sirf yahi sabit hone vaala he ki modi ek 'asurakshit taanashaah' hai
 Rahul Gandhi tweeted, 'modi ji, changing India into police rule is not going to solve your problems
 'isse ek arab se adhik bhartiya nagarikon ke samaksh sirf yahi sabit hone vaala he ki aap kis tarah ke asurakshit taanashaah hai'
 Significantly, the Modi government has issued an order under which the government can now scan the data of any computer
 grih mantralay ne computer ke data kii jaanch ke liye 10 kendriya agenciyon ke adhikaar badha die hai
 Investigation agencies will now be able to check the data contained in any computer
 ye pehali baar he jab kai agenciyon ko aise adhikaar die gaye hai
 Union Home Secretary Rajiv Gauba issued orders in this regard on Thursday
 iske baad vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa or ise niztaa ke adhikaar par hamalaa bataaya
 Congress leader Anand Sharma said that this government order is against fundamental rights
 is par supreme court ke nirnay ke anusaar bhi yah niztaa aapkaa moulik adhikaar he
 This order hurts the right to privacy
 is aadesh se sarkaar desh ke har naagarik kii puri jaankaree ko dekhne kii anumati de rahi he
 This has also posed a great threat to democracy
 hamane ye kaha he ki sarkaar kii taraf se ek baari sankhya main jo sammanit log hai, saansad hai yaa bade adhikari yaa supreme court, hoicourt ke jaj ke telephone bhi check ho rahe hai
 We will oppose it
 yah kisi bhi prajatantr ke liye sweekaarya nahin he
 Choreographer-director Farah Khan has learned a lot from the failure of Tees Maar Khan
 farah ne kaha, tees maar khan main koreography ke liye mujhe bhale hi puraskaar mila ho, lekin isse sabakuch nahin mil jaataa he
 It could not achieve as much success as the previous two films
 is film se kaaphi apekshaayen judi hui thim, lekin, iske liye mujhe koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 He said, fans expect a lot from me
 apni asafalataa se maine kaaphi sabak siikhaa he
 This helps you in the days ahead
 akshay kumaar abhinit tees maar khan prashansakon ke bich koi jaadu nahin paidaa kar saki, lekin iske ek item geet shila kii javaani ko logon ne haathon-haath liya
 Farah is now ready to direct the fourth film
 vah kahati hai, main ek film nirdeshit karuungi
 i am working on it now
 agle saal isaki shooting shuru hogi
 a decision of the Central Election Commission has brought great relief to those parties whose performance in the last Lok Sabha election was poor or very poor
 bahujan samaaj party (bispi), rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) or communist party of india (sipiai) jaisi partiyon ke liye chunaav ayog kaa yah faisla raahat laayaa he ki ab in partiyon kii rashtriya pahchaan ke bare main nirnay varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kiya jayega, kyonki agar maujuuda niyamon ke hisaab se faisla liya jaataa, to in partiyon kii rashtriya manyata khatm ho jaati
 To be a national party, any party has to win at least 11 seats, which are in three different states
 duusari vaikalpik shart yah he ki pichley loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha chunaav main chaar rajyon main kul maton kaa chah fisadi vot mila ho or saath main chaar loksabhaa siten jiti hon
 Or the third condition is that the party enjoys regional party status in four states
 abhi congress or bijepi ke alaava marxvaadi communist party of india (sipiem), sipiai, bispi or ensipi ke paas rashtriya party kaa darja he
 In 2014, the BSP did not get a single Lok Sabha seat, the NCP got six seats, but the vote percentage was 1
 6 pratishat ho gaya
 The CPI could win only one seat, and its vote share was less than one percent
 haal yah he ki 2004 main 44 siten jitkar bijepi or congress ke baad sabase badi party rahi sipiem kii pahchaan par bhi khatre ke badal mandara rahe hai
 Recently, in order to save the identity of its national party, several parties in the Election Commission here presented their views, after which the Commission has decided that now the level of the national party will be reviewed after every two elections
 haalanki mul niyam jo hai, vahi bane rahenge
 The comments chah rashtriya partiyon ke alaava desh main 60 se adhik manyataprapt kshetreey dal hai
 This recognition has several advantages
 jaise ek rashtriya party ko puure desh main ek hi chunaav chihn miltaa he
 Land and buildings are provided for the party's office
 radio or tivi par chunaav ke vakt prachaar kaa free vakt diya jaataa he or chunaav ke vakt 40 star campeneron kaa kharch kisi ummidavaar ke chunaav kharch main nahin judata
 By 2019, many such parties have been relieved, whose performance in the last Lok Sabha election was laggard
 ab agle chunaav main ye partiyaan satta ke darvaaze tak pahunchen yaa nahin, lekin pahchaan bachaane kii koshish main zarur lagi hongi

 ab agle chunaav main ye partiyaan satta ke darvaaze tak pahunchen yaa nahin, lekin pahchaan bachaane kii koshish main zarur lagi hongi
 At present, apart from Congress and BJP, Communist Party of India (CPM), CPI, BSP and NCP have national party status
 2014 main bispi ko ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin mili, ensipi ko chah siten to milin, lekin vot pratishat 1
 6 percent
 sipiai to ek hi seat jeet pai, or uskaa vot share ek pratishat se bhi kam rahaa
 The situation is that even after winning 44 seats in 2004, the identity of CPM, which is the largest party after BJP and Congress, is also under threat
 pichley dinon apni rashtriya party kii pahchaan ko bachaane ke liye yahaan chunaav ayog main kai partiyon ne apana paksh rakhaa, jiske baad ayog ne faisla kiya he ki ab rashtriya party ke str kii samiksha har do chunaavon ke baad hogi
 However, the basic rules are the same
 tippaniyan Apart from six national parties, there are more than 60 recognized regional parties in the country
 is manyata ke kai phaayde hai
 For example, a national party gets only one election symbol in the entire country
 party ke daftar ke liye zamin or bhawan diya jaataa he
 At the time of election, free publicity is given on radio and TV and during the election the cost of 40 star campaigners is not included in the election expenses of any candidate
 ab 2019 tak kai aise dalon ko raahat mil gai he, jinka pradarshan pichley loksabhaa chunaav main phiseddi rahaa tha
 Now whether or not these parties reach the door of power in the next election, they must have started trying to save their identity

 Seeing what a CCTV camera recorded in Bhind's district hospital, anyone should be able to stand up
 maamla har kisi ko hairaani main daalane vaala he
 12 on Wednesday, 13 December 2015
 37 baje kaa vakt
 This CCTV camera installed outside the maternity home of the hospital is on
 apane saamne honevaali har harakat ko record kar rahaa he
 a few seconds pass and this camera captures a picture of a man for the first time
 ye shaks kuch ladkadhaata hua meternity home ke vatting lounj main aakar baith jaataa he
 Just as if he is drunk with alcohol
 uske peeche-peeche ek doosraa shaks bhi thik usee andaaj main aakar uski bagal main baithta he
 Soon after, a woman passes by and then several people come together and sit in the waiting area of the Maternity Home
 lekin iske chand seconds ke baad yahaan kuch itnaa daraavna hota he ki use bayaan kar paanaa bhi mushkil he
 Now another woman from outside comes running towards this waiting lounge
 shaayad wo chilla rahi he yaa phir use bhaagate hue dekhakar kisi khatre kii ashanka se is lounj main maujuud tamaam log bhi vahaan se fouran bhaag khadey hote hai
 It is now exactly 38 minutes and 09 seconds at 12 o'clock in the night
 ab baahar kii taraf se tishart or pant pahane tandoorust kad-lathi kaa ek shaks daudta hua vatting lounj par pahunchataa he
 He turns and looks behind him in some way, as if someone is following him
 uski tishart khun se sani he or use dekhakar ye lagata he ki wo shaayad kisi se bachane ke liye is vatting lounj kii taraf pahunchaa he
 He enters directly from the glass door in the waiting lounge and closes the glass door trying to escape from his enemy
 tab tak haath main bandook liye uskaa peechha kar ek doosraa shaks camere par namoodaar hota he
 But the first person running away from life tries to escape by hiding in the glass door
 lekin ek pal ke liye shaayad wo ye bhul chukaa he ki darwaja shishe kaa he or iske aar-paar naa sirf aasaani se dekha ja saktaa he, balki ise goli bhi chhed sakati he
 Then the very next moment the chase man with the gun in his hand comes from the other side of the glass wall and comes firing at the person on the other side
 goli kaa shikaar banane vaala shaks kisi phiraki kii tarah hawa main ghumkar aundhe munh jameen par gir jaataa he or farsh par khun kii dhar bah nikalati he
 This is all very scary
 
 But the incident does not end here, but there is still more feud between the murderer and Maktool
 ab kaatil shishe ke daravaaje se andar aakar usee bandook se makatool ko dobaaraa nishaanaa banane kii koshish karata he
 But the gun might not work
 udhar, in tamaam baton se bekhbar ek aadmi ab vatting lounj kii taraf aata he, lekin ye sabakuch dekhakar wo bhi fouran ulte paanv waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the unsuspecting attacker from the world walks out of the door for a few seconds and after fixing the gun, returns to Maktool on the ground again and this time also shoots another shot at his back from very close range
 phir usee raste se bhaag nikalataa he, jis raste wo apane dushman kaa peechha karata hua vatting lounj kii taraf aayaa tha
 Now listen to the story behind this live murder
 darasal ye kahani he teen doston kii
 Both friends who shot on camera and were shot on camera, while the third friend was also injured in the same hospital
 use bhi goli lagi he, par is haadase se pehle
 He was not shot by anyone else, but by one of these two friends
 koi dost hi apane kisi dost ke khun kaa pyaasa ho jaae or use ek nahin, balki kai-kai goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaae, to sunne main ajeeb lagata he
 But this story of Bhind is something like this
 jaan lete or jaan ganvaate dikh rahe ye donon is vakt beshak ek-duusare ke aamane-saamne hon, lekin police kii maane, to ye donon ek-duusare ke achche dost hua karte the
 The horror behind the murder of CCTV in Bhind's district hospital is as scary, the more shocking the story behind it
 police kii maane, to is vaardaat se chand minute pehle tak makatool vimalesh or kaatil dharmendra apane ek tisare saathi sanju ke saath mil kar sharaab pi rahe the
 At first, while drinking liquor in Chaturvedi city of the city, the three of them heard and said something about each other and then in anger, Vimlesh shot and injured Sanju
 lekin jab vimalesh ko apane kiye kaa ahsaas hua, to khud usee ne apane dost dharmendra ke saath milakar tisare dost sanju ko motorcycle par ladakar aspataal pahunchaaya
 But with Sanju hospitalized, what happened between Vimlesh and Dharmendra was that Dharmendra suddenly became thirsty for Vimlesh's blood
 iske baad dharmendra ne vimalesh ko pehle goliyon kaa nishaanaa banaaya
 Frightened to death, Vimlesh escaped despite being bled and then approached the hospital's maternity home
 iske baad yahaan shishe ke daravaaje kii oot main usne apni jaan bachaane kii koshish kii, lekin peechha karata hua yahaan tak aa pahunche dost se dushman bane dharmendra ne use aakhirkaar goli maar di or maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Due to this incident of murder in the hospital in the middle of the night, people got into trouble
 lekin teen doston kii ye kahani sunakar har koi hairaan rah jaae
