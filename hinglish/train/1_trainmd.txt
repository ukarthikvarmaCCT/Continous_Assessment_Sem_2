 a fellow was deliberately placed behind me in the camp
 jabardastee dere ke aadmi ke saath rahane ko majaboor kiya gaya
 He who is a committee of 25 members or not Gurmeet, he forced to stay
 maine manaa kiya to bole bahan ham kya kar sakate hai
 There were 25 members, then 45 were in the committee (this is the committee that was ready to do anything for Gurmeet, after the decision, the same committee had the responsibility of rioting, some have been arrested) Forced wrongdoing in the camp

 kaise sat brahmacharee sevadaar banati hai mahilaayendere main hi rahane vaale yaa kuch baahar ke log bhi apni kunvaari betiyon ko daan main gurmeet ko dete the
 For 3-4 years these virgin girls were trained, that is to serve
 
 
 us vakt inako brahmacharee kaha jaataa tha
 They would be interviewed after 3-4 years of training
 phir gurmeet gupha main prasad detaa tha or uske baad inhen sat brahmacharee sevadaar bolaa jaataa tha
 In the cave of Gurmeet under the pretext of Prasad, wrongdoing was done
 CBI cese ke baad badla kunvaari sadhvi kaa gharsaal 2007 main jab sibiai cese hua to gurmeet ram rahim ne sadhvi ke rahane kaa ghar badal diya

 There used to be discussion in the camp
 lekin, dar ke maare koi jubaan nahin kholta tha, or phir baahar kii janata ko pataa bhi to nahin chalane detaa tha
 In the night, all the wrong things were done on the pretext of satsang
 main tang aakar baahar bhaagi to meraa peechha nahin choda
 He was beaten several times, no one came out of the camp and left the chase till he died
 dere kii vajah se meraa parivaar barbaad ho gaya
 i am dead, just alive with courage
 gurmeet ne pataa nahin kaisaa kaala jaadu kar rakhaa tha
 In the camp, people used to say, 'father, listen to the song
 
 
 ', log pagal ho jate the, main bhi bevakoof bani phir jab samaj aayaa to pataa chalaa ye kitna bada paakhandee he
 On Honeypreet, i stayed with Honeypreet for almost a year in Khuldeer

 It was also heard that Gurmeet had made Honey a relation

 Vipassana called Honeypreet

 The audio tape played a pivotal role in the investigation of the case

 Its transcription was later assigned to the ED
 'aaj tak' ke paas yah baatcheet maujuud he
 The first audio tape was a conversation between two intermediaries Carlo Gerosa and Gaido Hashke of Augusta Westland for the disappearance of documents related to bribes
 carlo gerosa -hamaare len-dein kii jaanch shuru ho gai to kya hoga?gaido hashke -are, tum isaki phikr chhod do
 We have prepared such a network of companies that the heat of investigation will never reach us
 or agar, kabhi aisa hua bhi to jaanch ko ham tak pahunchane main 10 saal lag jaaenge or tab tak paisa morishas main hoga
 Carlo Gerosa - What will happen to the documents that have been exchanged between us? Guido Hashke - All documents related to our and Augusta Westland transactions have been missing from the Lugano office in Switzerland

 Carlo Gerosa - give the rest of the documents to me, I'll take them and hide them in the wardrobe

 Due to both investigations in this, Augusta looked worried about payment from Westland
 carlo gerosa -hello, hashke
 
 
 i don't think agustawestland will stop paying entirely because of the investigation
 gaido hashke -haa, mujhe bhi aisa hi lagata he
 They will not stop payment
 carlo gerosa -kyonki agar aisa hua, to ye ek tarah se apni galati maanane jaisi hogi

 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya namdhari ne 200 karod rupee hadapney ke liye 17 november ko rachi thi shootout kii sajeesh? kya namdhari ne hi us rakam ko hadapney kii khatir karaayaa tha khoonkhraba? jaanch philhal jari he or dilli police kaa daawa he ki asli mujrim jald hi benakaab hoga

 According to the railway police, Abdul Hakim, who lived in Uttam Nagar, on July 6, first took his wife Meshhar Jahan's knee to Hapur from Anand Vihar bus station for treatment, then returned from Moradabad Passenger with his wife back to Delhi
 As soon as the train stopped in Ghaziabad on the train in time, he killed his wife by strangling her and kept the body in the sleeper berth

 The comments ab tak police pati ko ek peedit samaj rahi thi,uske baad 25 july ko pati kii maujuudagi main hi meshar jahaan kaa postmortem karavaaya jaataa he,or 8 agast ko jaise hi postmortem report main khulaasa hota he kii meshar kii galaa dabaakar hatya kii gai he to shaq pati par aakar tik jaataa he
 When the police interrogates the accused husband, in order to mislead the police, he accused the accused of murder
 lekin jab sakhti se poochtacha hoti he to wo jurm kabool kar letaa he
 According to police, the accused has already divorced two wives
 45 saal kaa aaropee pati teesri patni ke saath bhi kush nahi tha or use bhi talaak dena chahta tha
 Not only this, the accused himself got an insurance policy of about Rs 5 lakh from his wife and also started paying his installment, and then murdered him to redeem that policy

 police aaropee pati se poochtacha karti he to police ko gumraah karne ke liye usne hatya kaa aarope kisi or par laga diya
 But when strictly questioned, he confesses the crime
 police ke mutabik aaropee pehle hi do patniyon ko talaak de chukaa he
 The accused husband of 45 years was not happy with his third wife and wanted to divorce her too
 yahi nahi khud aaropee ne hi apni patni kii kareeb 5 lakh rupye kii beemaa policy karwaai uski kisht bhi bharna shuru kii,uske baad us policy ko bhunaane ke liye uskaa katl kiya
 The railway police was engaged in identifying the dead body, when the accused husband started preparing to get his wife's insurance policy done in cash
 lekin usee vakt aaropee pati ko pataa chalaa kii jab patni kaa shav nahin milegaa to kareeb 7 saal tak beemaa kaa clem nahi milegaa,isliye aaropee apni hi patni kii photo lekar 23 july ko puraani dilli railway stesan pahunch jaataa he or jaise hi old dilli railway thane kii police patni meshar jahaan kii photo dekhati he ,yard main mili shav kii shinaakht ho jaati he

 Demand for loan waiver is increasing from many states of the country after the loan of Rs
 36 thousand crores was waived by the farmers of Uttar Pradesh to fulfill the election promise of the Prime Minister
 jahaan beete 3 hafton se tamilnadu ke kisaan dilli main dharne par baithe hai vahiin kai rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne pradhanmantri se upi kii tarj par apane kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne ke liye guhaar lagaai he
 Now after the UP decision, it is evident that the rest of the states will also spend thousands of crores of rupees from the state exchequer and will try to bridge the debts of the people, which will directly put pressure on the treasury of the central government
 tamilnadu:beete 140 saal main sabase gambhir sookhe kii sthiti jhel rahe tamilnadu ne kendra sarkaar se 39,565 karod rupee kii vittiya sahaayta kii guhaar lagaai thi
 According to the state government, the central government should provide financial assistance to him on the lines of UP so that he can take a decision to forgive the farmers' debt
 tamilnadu ne maang kii he ki rajya ke kisaanon kaa sahakaari bank ke saath-saath rashtriyakrut bainkon se liya karj bhi maaf kiya jaae
 Maharashtra: After the loan waiver of farmers in Uttar Pradesh, pressure has been increased on the bjp-sponsored Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis government to forgive the debt
 ensipi, congress or shivasena ne mukhyamantri ko 3 din ke andar kisaanon ke karj maafee par faisla lene kaa ultimatum diya he
 The farmers owe a debt of Rs 30,500 crore to the farmers in Maharashtra and the state government is requesting help from the central government to forgive this debt
 rajya sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki rajya ke khajaane se is karj kii bharpai karnaa naammumkin he
 Punjab: Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh met Prime Minister Narendra and requested to help the farmers in the state under debt burden
 pradhanmantri ko likhe patr ke mutabik punjab main kisaanon par kul 80,000 karod rupee kaa karj he
 Of this loan, Rs 12,500 crore has been borrowed from cooperative banks
 rajya main prati parivaar karj lagbhag 8 lakh rupee he
 Apart from these states, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Orissa and West Bengal are also struggling with the debt problem of farmers
 gauratlab he ki andhra or telugana ko pruthak karte vakt donon rajyon ne kisaanon ko karj mukt karne ke liekendra sarkaar se 1 lakhkarod rupee kii maang kii thi
 But at this time, the then Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan had rejected the loan waiver process, saying that this makes the condition of the banks of the country crisp
 ab uttar pradesh main kisaanon ke karj kaa boj rajya ke khajaane par padane ke baad or kendra sarkaar dwaara madad kaa aashwaasan milane ke baad desh ke baaki rajyon ko bhi ummid he ki unhen bhi aisa karne kaa mauka milegaa
 It is clear that in UP, the burden of more than Rs 36 thousand crores will ultimately go to the central government, while in other states also the burden of debt waiver will be on the treasury of the central government

 IPL founder and Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) president Lalit Modi is expected to return to India, with a major confrontation between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and RCA
 dilli hycourt kii justise badar durej ahamed or justise vibhu baakh degree kii khandpeeth ne 27 agast ko apane ek mahatvapurn faisle main modi kaa passport radd karne ke aadesh ko khaarij karte hue use behaal kar diya
 In this way the path of Modi's return to the country has been cleared
 pravartan nideshaalay ne unke khilaaf kai maamle darj kiye the, iske baad se ve landan main rah rahe the
 It started when he was estranged from the then Union Minister Shashi Tharoor and revealed his investments in IPL
 hycourt ke faisle par tippanee karte hue modi ne kaha, ''yah lambii or kathin ladaai rahi or main nirdosh sabit ho gaya hum
 i have faith in the justice system of the country
 main hameshaa bharat lautne ko kahata rahaa hum or der-saber jarur apane desh lautoonga
 i will keep fighting to make my favorite game cricket clean
 '' is faisle par unke vakil or atarni mahmud aabidi, jo aaarasie ke upaadhyaksh bhi hai, ne kaha, ''unki vaapasi se bisisiai kii andruni samasyaayein dur ho sakati hai
 Which n
 shrinivasana kii nirankush kaaryastylee se ghutan mahasoos kar rahe hai, ve ab unke or unki mandali ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa sakate hai
 The High Court bench said that no such serious issue was raised, which could lead to the cancellation of his passport
 aabidi ne kaha ki isi saal farvari main bombai hycourt ne bhi modi ke khilaaf sunwaayee kii karrwai rokane kii pravartan nideshaalay kii maang ko khaarij kar diya tha
 a division bench comprising Justice Wajifdar and Justice Kolabawala has given a similar ruling in two cases
 in maamalon main naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa ulanghan tha kyonki nideshaalay jin dastavejon ko aadhaar bana rahaa tha, unhen muhaiyaa nahin karaayaa gaya
 The court then gave the directorate the option to issue a fresh show cause notice, but it did not do so
 hycourt ke aadesh ko rajasthan main kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he, kyonki bisisiai ne aaarasie ko nilambit kar rakhaa he or use apane calendar main jagah dene se manaa kar diya he
 This puts the future of the young players of the state at risk
 yah aaarasie or nagpur cricket association ke adhyaksh ke bataur modi ke chayan kaa nateeja he
 BCCI has expelled Modi for life
 usne aaarasie ko chalaane ke liye apana panel gathit kiya tha
 But this panel cannot acquire the rights of RCA, as it would be a violation of Rajasthan Sports Law
 rajasthan khel kanoon aaarasie ko manyata detaa he, na ki is panel ko
 Amidst all this, Modi is planning to build a stadium like Lord's in Jaipur
 par jaipur vikaas praadhikaran ne kuch aapattiyaan jaahir kii hai or stadium ke liye aavantit jameen par nirmaan main ho rahi deree par sawaal uthaae hai
 It has demanded that if the new stadium is built then rca's building in SMS Stadium should be given back to it
 vahiin modi ko puraa bharosa tha ki bijepi kii sarkaar aane ke baad ve waapas laut sakenge
 He had a very good relationship with Narendra Modi, who is now the Prime Minister
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or adani samooh ke saath bhi unke achche rishte the
 He hopes that the Chief Ministers of the state, Vasundhara Raje and Sharad Pawar will also help him in his return
 lekin unke puraane mitron ne kathin samay main unka saath dene main ruchi nahin dikhaai or unhen court ke bharose chhod diya tha
 After coming to India, he will try to change the inner equation of BCCI
 bisisiai ko der-saver aaarasie ko apane calendar main shaamil karnaa hi padegaa, kyonki vah rajasthan ke yuva khiladinnon ko lambey samay tak dand nahin de saktaa he

 But very few people know who the hell is this film being made on Gunjan Saxena? What has he done for the country? Let's know about Gunjan Saxena's passion and the story of Shaurya
 paanch saal kii umr main gujan ne pehali baar cockpit dekha tha or tabhi thaan liya tha ek din vah desh ke liye fiter jet udaayengi
 Gunjan Saxena's father and brother were also in the army
 unhone dilli uniwarsity ke hansraj college se grajuation kii padhai kii he

 But when the Kargil War broke out in 1999, Gunjan Saxena did something that was probably impossible for a woman to do at that time
 darasal, jab yuddh ho rahaa tha to vayusena ko payalton kii tatkaal jarurat thi or bhartiya vayusena ne mahila payalton ko bulaayaa
 At that time, Gunjan Saxena was at the forefront
 unhone ladaai ke dauraan kai ghayal sainikon kii jaan bachaai or sainya sajo saamaan ko seemaa par le jane kaa kaam kiya
 Gunjan Saxena was awarded the Shaurya Chakra by the Government of India for his courage and bravery
 bhartiya vayusena ne oparation safed sagar ke jariye bharat ko kargil yuddh main jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi

 The Indian team management, who had completed their preparations before the difficult tour of South Africa, now say that after going 0-2 in the Test series, if they had got 10 more days to practice, the picture would have been different
 practice kii jagah hua ghoomana-phiranaapako bataa den ki africa ke is mushkil daure se pehle team india ko do divasiy abhyaas match khilne kaa mauka mila tha, jise radd kar diya gaya
 The Indian team management at that time argued that instead of a practice match, net practice would help Team India prepare better
 lekin test siries se pehle bhartiya khilaadiyon kii practice se zyada shopping or ghoomana-phirana surkhiyon main rahaa
 It was obviously not an ideal preparation before a difficult tour to South Africa, which proved costly for Team India
 iske alaava captain viraat kohli ne bhi team management ke abhyaas match nahin khilne ke faisle ko uchit tehraate hue kaha tha ki practice maichon main milane vaali wicket match main milane vaali wicket kaa 15 pratishat bhi nahin hongi
 Coach Shastri remembers practice after losing the series, just as Team India lost the series for the first time after winning 9 consecutive Test series, Indian coach Ravi Shastri is missing practice and preparation
 ab ravi shastri ne kaha ki 'main kahana chaahunga ki yahaan abhyaas ke liye 10 din or milte to kaaphi badlaav hota
 The 'foreign conditions' are the main reason for falling behind 0-2 in the series
 pehle do test maichon main team india ke karaab pradarshan se ab ye sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya viraat kii sena south africa main gendbaajon ke anukool paristhitiyon main khilne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar thi, yaa phir team india bhul gai thi ki yahaan unhone 25 saal se sirf do match hi jite hai

 Kamal Nath said that i have requested Digvijay Singh to contest the Lok Sabha elections from any difficult seat if he wants to contest
 bhopal or indaur jaisi loksabhaa siton kii baat karte hue unhone kaha ki pradesh main 2-3 loksabhaa siten aisi hai jahaan se ham 30-35 saal se nahin jite hai
 Soon after the candidates were announced, they said that the former Chief Minister himself should decide from where he wants to contest the election
 tikat bantwaare ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha ki agle 3-4 din main loksabhaa chunaav main madhyapradesh se congress ummidavaaron ke tikat baantne kaa kaam shuru ho jayega
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath has come on a two-day visit to Chhindwara

 kamalnath ke bete ko tikat?chhindwara loksabhaa seat se kamalnath ke putr nakul nath ke congress ummidavaar banane kii ummid he
 However, Congress has not made any formal announcement regarding this
 kamalnath chhindwara loksabhaa seat se 9 baar saansad rahe hai
 After becoming the Chief Minister, he has to be elected a member of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly within six months as per rules
 upachunaav karaane ke liye chaar baar congress vidhayak rahe deepak saxena ne chhindwara vidhansabha seat se istipha dekar kamalnath ke liye rasta saaf kar diya tha

 New Delhi: The two-day seminar organized by Sahitya Akademi on the topic 'fine Essay: Format and Tradition' has ended
 duusare din ke pratham satr kii adhyakshata prakhyat lekhak arunesh neeran ne kii or vidyavindu singh evam manjari chaturvedi ne apane aalekh prastut kiye
 Manjari Chaturvedi, while speaking on the theme of 'fine Essay Tradition: Poorvarang', said that fine essays have a rhythm like songs and that there is a vast range of ideas in it
 chaturvedi ne hajariprasad dvivedi, vidyanivas mishra, kubernath raay or viveki raay ke lalit nibandhon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki jahaan hajaari prasad dvivedi ke niabandh vaicharik the vahiin vidyanivas mishra ji ke niabandh bhaavnaatmak the
 Viveki Rai threaded rural life and regionalism in his essays while Kubernath Rai's essays went to the deep mysteries of Indian culture
 hindi sahitya ke in chaaron charchit lalit nibandhkaron kii charchaa karte hue unhone kaha ki inhone bhashaa kaa jo nayaa sansar rachaa he, usko bachaae rakhana nai peedi ke liye chunauti hogi, vidyavindu singh ne apana aalekh vidyanivas mishra ke rachana-sansar par kendrit karte hue kaha ki vidyanivas mishra main jadon se judane kii prabal ichha thi, unhone unke kai vyaktivyanjak nibandhon kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki unke nibandhon kii visheshta yah he ki vah use samvednaa ke shikhar tak pahunchaakar naatakeey mode dete hai jiske kaaran pathakon kii ruchi ant tak bani rahati he
 In the presidential statement, Arunesh Neeran recalled his intimate relationship with Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Vidyanivas Mishra and Kuberanath Rai, saying that these three also captured the sight and pain of the invisible behind him, his pain, gaiety etc
 
 in teenon kaa rachana sansar itnaa vaividhypurna or vyapak he ki aane vaali kai pidiyon ke liye yah prerana kaa kaam karata rahegaa
 The second session of the day focused on the theme 'lalit Essay Tradition: Uttar Rang'
 vivek dube ne vartmaan peedi ke lalit nibandhkaron shyamsundar dube, shriram parihaar evam ashtabhuja shukla kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki inke lalit nibandhon main ham uttar parampara kii saanskrithik chetana ke vividh ayaamon ko dekh sakate hai
 Comparing the present environment and the global environment, he said that in changing contexts we have to face these most pressing challenges in our writing
 hoobanath pandeya ne kubernath raay, narmada prasad upaadhyaay, krishnakumar mishra ke lalit niabandh lekhan kaa zikr karte kaha ki in lekhakon ne hamaari parampara ko jivit rakhaa he lekin aane vaale samay main is vidha ke liye pathak jutanaa or nibandhon ko prakashit karvaa paanaa bahut mushkil hoga
 He said that this is also because our present creators have almost surrendered themselves to colonialism
 is satr ke adhyakshiya vaktavy main madhavendra pandeya ne kaha ki main uttar aadhuniktaa evam vartmaan paristhitiyon main lalit niabandh kii charchaa karte hue kahana chahta hoon ki yah vidha sahitya main lagbhag anupasthit he
 Today, when the whole environment is opposed to elegance, how can fine essay writing keep its place? He further said that the first attack of postmodernism is on the folk, whereas the main source of the fine essay is folk
 unhone lalit niabandh ke sabhi mul tattvon ke aprasangik hote jane par chintaa prakat karte hue kaha ki inako bachaana behad zaruri he

 (input bhashaa se) (from input language) lokapal bill ko lekar sarkaar kaa taalu ravaiya ab bhi jari he
 The cabinet meeting has been postponed once again regarding this bill
 ab ye shaam ko hogi
 It was decided earlier that there would be a cabinet meeting at Lokpal at 2 pm
 duusari ore congress ke netaaon ko mantra diya gaya he ki ve anna ke lokapal ke kilaaf kya daleelein pesh karen
 How to prove to the public that Anna's Lokpal Bill is not correct
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar ne lokapal kaa aisa draft taiyaar kiya he jo team anna ko bhale hi manjuur naa ho lekin sansad main vipakshi dal use nakaar nahin paaenge
 After the agitation for the last two days, finally the day has come when the draft of Lokpal Bill will be kept in the cabinet for approval
 somvaar kal dopaher north block main pi chidambaram ke daftar main sansadeey kaary mantri pawan bansal, kapil sibbal, salmaan khurshid or narayan sami samet sarkaar ke varisht mantriyon ne lokapal ke draft par maathapai kii
 After the meeting, Law Minister Salman Khurshid told the good news of the completion of the draft of the bill
 beshak, sarkaar ne masauda taiyaar hone kaa elaan kar diya he, lekin kai masalon par pench abhi bhi funsane kaa sanket hai
 For example, the cbi-ombudsman issue has not been agreed to, as well as the constitutional deadlock on the issue of reservation in the Lokpal, the government has accepted it and on many issues there is no opinion among the Advocate Ministers of the Manmohan Government
 is bich, ajtak ko sutron ke hawaale se mili exclusive jaankaree ke mutabik sarkaar ne maujuuda draft main teen din ke bheetar saath se zyada badlaav kar die hai
 The government has accepted the procedural form of Anna's Lokpal but does not appear ready to accept his institutional form

 According to the information received by Aaj Tak, the government is not ready to subject the CBI to the Lokpal
 wo zyada se zyada ye kar sakati he ki sibiai kii jaanch shakha alag karke use lokapal ke aadhin kar de
 The government has also agreed to form a committee to appoint the CBI chief and to place the Leader of Opposition and Lokpal along with the PM in that committee
 haalanki anna or unke saathi sibiai par koi samjhauta karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 According to sources, if the draft Lokpal gets the green signal of the cabinet today, the government will put it in Parliament tomorrow or Tuesday and will try to get it passed before the session ends on December 22
 agar usamen baat nahin bani to christmas kii chuttee ke baad 27, 28 or 29 taarikh ko sansad kaa satr badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Although the government is not officially making any statement on the extension of the session of Parliament, but the way things are still not clear on many issues, it can be said that the Lokpal bill will be passed in this session
 The jis dilli shahar ke mukhyamantri rahe, aaj usee dilli main kiraye kaa makaan talash paane main naakaam sabit ho rahe hai aravind kejariwal
 
 
 Actually, former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal lived in the Girnar apartment flat allotted in the name of his wife in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad, adjacent to Delhi, but after becoming the Chief Minister of Delhi, he forced his decision to shift to Delhi and finally to Central Delhi
 Shifted to Tilak Lane house
 lekin, 14 farvari ko mukhyamantri pad se istifa dene ke baad kejariwal ko ye ghar khaali karnaa tha, chunaav or beti kii pariksha ke chalate kejariwal ne faisla kiya ki wo is sarkari awaas kaa 85,000 rupee maheene kaa kiraaya chukaayenge or beti kii pariksha ke baad ye ghar khaali kar denge
 Then, the month of June arrived and Kejriwal did not vacate the house
 kuch logon ne unke ghar khaali na karne ko lekar unke ghar ke baahar pradarshan bhi kiya
 Meanwhile, recently, news was received that Kejriwal would vacate the government house in 1-2 days and shift to East Delhi's Mayur Vihar
 lekin, sab kuch tay hone ke baad ye maamla bhi funs gaya kyonki ye ghar koi aam aadmi nahin balki aam aadmi party ke pramukh aravind kejariwal ke liye jo tha
 Actually, there are other reasons why Arvind Kejriwal is unable to find a rented house for his family
 pehla, aravind kejariwal ko dhyaan rakhana he ki jahaan wo rahe wo jagah aasaani se pahunchane laayak ho, saath hi vahaan ke aasapaas ke log or maahaul aisa ho ki bheedbhad hone par logon ko dikkat naa ho
 Arvind has a total of six members in his family, so a house of 3-4 rooms is compulsory
 baat ye bhi he ki kejariwal purv mukhyamantri hone ke saath hi ek party ke pramukh hai, or pratishthit nai dilli vidhaan sabha se vidhayak bhi hai, isliye unako ghar main hi ek offis bhi rakhana hoga jiske liye jagah honi chahie
 And the biggest thing is that the house should not be a victim of criticism
 yahaan yaad rakhana zaruri he ki kejariwal ke ghar ko lekar vivaad pehle bhi ho chukaa he or wo bhi acha khaasaa to abhi kejariwal ke liye mushkil samay he
 On one occasion, the party performed poorly than expected, there is discontent within and outside the party and it is a matter of great concern for them not to get home from above

 swatantraaa diwas par apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakistan ko gherte hue baluchistan ke saath-saath gilgit-baltistan kaa bhi zikr kiya tha
 By doing so, he has drawn attention to an area that is strategically important
 sindhu nadi ko apane daaman main samete is ilaake main mount everest se kuch hi kam oonchi parvat chotiyaan hai
 Its history is almost forgotten and whose political future is shrouded in suspicion
 kai aise mudde hai jinpar pakistan is ilaake ko lekar asahaj sthiti main aa jaataa he
 We are referring here to 12 things that undermine Pakistan's claim: 1
 varsh 1947 main bharat vibhaajan ke samay yah kshetra, jammu evam kashmir kii tarah na bharat kaa hissaa rahaa or na hi pakistan kaa
 The Dogra rulers with the British canceled the lease deed on August 1, 1947 and retained control of the area
 lekin, maharaja hari sih ko giligit scout ke sthaneey commander karnal mirza hasan khan ke vidroh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Khan declared independence of gilgit-baltistan on 2 November 1947
 isse do din pehle 31 oktober ko hari singh ne riyasat ke bharat main vilay ko manjuuri di thi
 21 days later Pakistan entered the region and captured the area on military force
 2
 Till April 1949, gilgit-baltistan remained considered part of Pakistan
 lekin, 28 april 1949 ko pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir kii sarkaar ke saath ek samjhauta hua, jiske tahat gilgit ke maamalon ko sidhe pakistan kii centre sarkaar ke maatahat kar diya gaya
 This agreement is known as Karachi Agreement
 mahatvapurn yah he ki kshetra kaa koi bhi netaa is qaraar main shaamil nahin tha
 3
 bharat kaa daawa he ki gilgit-baltistan 1947 tak vajood main rahi jammu evam kashmir riyasat kaa hissaa rahaa tha or isiilie yah pakistan ke saath kshetreey vivaad kaa hissaa he
 4
 das lakh se adhik kii jansankhya vaale vivaadit gilgit-baltistan main do swatantraaa diwas manaae jate hai
 One is on 14 August, when Pakistan celebrates its Independence Day and another on 1 November, when the region remembers its independence achieved in 1947
 yah aazaadee mahaj 21 din tak tik pai thi
 5
 pakistanne baad main gilgit-baltistan ke sudur uttar main sthit ek ilaake ko karkoram rajmarg ke nirmaan ke liye china ko 'gift' kar diya
 The locals oppose this
 unhen dar he ki is pariyojna kaa makasad kshetra ke janasankhyikeey charitra ko badalanaa he
 People want them to be a part of the process of resolving the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan
 6
 Pakistan says that the Dogra monarchy had abolished control of the area and Maharaja Hari Singh, the last king of Jammu and Kashmir, had no authority over the area spread over 73 thousand square kilometers
 to yahaan sawaal uthta he ki pakistan ko is kshetra kaa niyantran kaise mil gaya?7
 After this dispute, since then, Pakistan's stance has remained ambiguous and evasive about the sovereignty and constitutional status of this region dominated by Pakistan
 haalanki, pakistan bharat ke daawey ko nahin maanata
 It says that the Dogra rulers included this area in Jammu and Kashmir in 1846, otherwise it has never been a part of this princely state
 8
 In favor of its claim, Pakistan cites the 1935 lease deed that gave the British rulers control of the region for 60 years
 9
 China is investing extensively in the region to exploit the minerals and hydroelectric resources of the region
 china ke saath milakar pakistan yahaan rail coridor or anya project laayaa he jise bharat ne avaidh bataaya he
 10
 is vivaadit kshetra main china kii pahunch or pakistan ke damankaaree shashan dwaara kathith maanavadhikaar ulanghan ne ilaake main algaavvaadi andolan ko janm diya
 But, little is known about this movement
 behad kade sangheey kanoon ilaake tak videshiyon or media kii pahunch ko lagbhag asambhav banaate rahe hai
 11
 pakistan gilgit main kisi bhi asantosh ko sainya shakti se kuchal detaa he
 Gilgit social activist Senge Hasanan Sering said that its latest example is the statement of Federal Planning Minister Ehsan Iqbal, in which he said that a very strong anti-terrorism law will be imposed on those opposing the china-pakistan corridor
 semring washington sthit institute for gilgit-baltistan studies ke adhyaksh hai or kshetra ke pratirodh andolanon ke samarthak hai
 12

 pichley kuch maheenon main rajdhani banaae jane kii aashaaon ke bich is ilaake main zameenon ke daam aasmaan chune lage hai
 It is noteworthy that in June, a new state of Telangana was created after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh
 vyavastha thi ki varsh 2024 tak hyderabad donon rajyon kii rajdhani banaae rakhaa ja saktaa he, or uske baad iti hub ke rup main mashhoor hyderabad nae rajya telugana ko saunp diya jayega
 Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu is credited with making Hyderabad a 'silicon Valley' almost a decade ago, and committed to the formation of a new state that he would build a 'super capital' on the lines of Singapore
 kai saptaah tak vah sanket dete rahe ki nai rajdhani shaktishaalee tathaa prabhavi kamma samudaay ke ilaake vijaywada ke nikat hogi
 However, a committee appointed by the Center to assist in the identification of a proper city for the capital, says that there is no thousands of acres of land around Vijayawada and Guntur that would be needed to make the capital
 samiti ne chetaya tha ki yahaan kii upjau krishibhumi kaa adhigrahan kaaphi kathin or mahangaa sabit hoga
 This alleged choice of Chandrababu Naidu was most strongly opposed by the Jaganmohan Reddy-led YSR Congress, which has considerable dominance in the Rayalaseema region
 wiesar congress ke netaaon ne aarope lagaaya ki chandrababu naidu kii telugudesham party ke ek sadsy ne vijaywada ke nikat kaaphi badi zamin kharidi hui he, or vahi mukhyamantri ko prabhavit kar rahe hai
 Jaganmohan Reddy warned that he would not accept the Chief Minister's unilateral decision
 unka kahana tha ki nai rajdhani ko lekar guuruuvaar ko vidhansabha main bahes or voting karwaai jaae
 On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh's Chandrababu Naidu government has laid out its ambitious plan to make the state 'prosperous' and make it among the top three states of the country by 2022
 andhra pradesh ko 'hawaii or samudri centre' ke rup main viksit karne tathaa rajya ke aarthik vikaas main vruddhi kii disha main sarkaar ne kai kaaryakramon ko apane agenda main shaamil kiya he
 The main agenda of the government includes development of 14 small and big shores, equalization of Singapore in maritime activities, development of three international airports and 14 domestic airports, three 'mega cities' and 11 'smart cities' besides 28 specials Programs such as the development of economic zones (sezs) are included
 rajya main antar-deshiy jalmargon kaa nirmaan or tateey shahar kakinada ko puduccheri ke saath jodne vaale 'rashtriya jalmaarg' kii yojana is mahatvakankshi yojana kaa hissaa hai
 After the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, five 'grids' and seven 'campaigns' have been included for the state's reconstruction
 sarkaar dwaara jin paanch gridon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he, unamem jal, urja, rajmarg, gas or fibre optic shaamil hai
 The seven campaigns include priority sector, social empowerment, development of capacity and knowledge, development of cities, development of industry sector and infrastructure

 ek samay hua karata tha jab ladakiyon kii shaadi 25 paar karne se pehle hi kar di jaati thi lekin aaj praathamiktaayen badal gai hai
 Now most girls start thinking about marriage after crossing 30
 ab unki praathamikta shaadi karnaa nahin balki khud kaa kariyar bananaa ho gaya he
 By the age of 30, they get married and start planning their family somewhere after two to three years
 lekin bahut kam logon ko pataa he ki ye lifestil khatarnaak he
 With increasing age, there are many problems related to getting pregnant and giving birth to a child, in which both mother and child are at risk
 aaie jaanate hai wo khatre jinka saamana aapako karnaa pad saktaa he agar aap 30 saal ke baad maa banane ke bare main soch rahi hai
 Here the permission of the boss is to be taken before becoming a mother

 This situation is also not true for the mother

 The risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women after 35 years increases significantly
 hai blad pressure kii sthiti na to maa ke liye acchhee he or na hi bachche ke liye
 Know how cardiac surgery is done in AIIMS 4
 umr ke prabhaav ke chalate madhumeh hone kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 The condition of diabetes can prove to be very dangerous and it can also be fatal especially if the child is born with surgery

 It is very difficult to conceive after 35, but even worse, the possibility of miscarriage increases greatly after this stage of age
 haalanki ivief or sarogesi jaise vikalp bhi kaaphi prachlit ho rahe hai lekin is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki inke safal hone kii gunjaaish shat-pratishat nahin hoti

 aaj main aapke saamne kuch jaruri muddon or ahm faislon par baat karne aayaa hum
 "exactly one year ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the country for the first time on demonetisation
 8 november kii der shaam pehle unhone bhrashtachar, kaale dhan or donon se ladgaye ke bare main baat kii
 Then as it was detonated, "in order to break the corruption and black money block, we have decided that the notes of five hundred and one thousand are in circulation today legally from the night of November 8, 2016
 Will no longer be valid
 "aane vaale kuch hi dinon main tasviir bilkul saaf ho gai
 The rationale behind this sudden move was that it would strike the roots of the country's black economy and end the counterfeit money market, which comes with financing of cross-border terrorism and elsewhere
 notebandi ko desh ke liye ek nirnaayak mode kii tarah pesh kiya gaya tha, ek aise apaardarshee or bhrasht tantra se prasthaan ke taur par, jiske baad vyavastha main paardarshita or eemaandaaree kaa raaj hoga
 It was also said that the black money which would be "exhausted" after demonetisation, would cost the Reserve Bank of India (and the government) between Rs 3 and 4 lakh crore
 kii aamadani hogi kyonki arabiai kii iske baraabar dendaree kam ho jaaegi
 There was no doubt about the seriousness of this problem
 america form global financial intigrity (jiepha) kaa anumaan tha ki akele 2014 main 21 arab dollar kaala kaa dhan desh ke baahar bheja gaya
 Another GFI report says that between 2004 and 2013, $ 505 billion, or Rs 30 lakh crore
 se zyada dhan desh ke baahar gaya
 Although the Directorate General of Revenue Intelligence, while replying to the SIT set up by the Supreme Court, described the number as "exaggerated", it is no joke to illegally go out of the country's borders for half a trillion dollars
 saal bhar baad haalanki paridrishy kaaphi dhundhala he
 Counting the direct benefits of demonetisation, at least on the basis of data, is still a difficult task
 ek sakaaratmak sanket haalanki janvari main ai ek report se miltaa he jiske anusaar notebandi ke baad hawala ke lenden main 50 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Its losses can be seen more easily on a larger scale
 iske elaan ke hafte bhar ke bheetar kai logon kii nakadi ke abhaav main maut ho gai
 Some suffered a heart attack standing in the queues of the bank
 aaj jabaki 15
 4 lakh crore Rs
 yani band kii gai mudra kaa 99 fisadi arabiai ke paas waapas pahunch chukaa he, to kuch lakh karod kaa ginvaaya gaya laabh dur-dur tak nahin dikhataa
 This has raised questions on the government's prudence about black money, which it considers to be hidden money that can be dug out at any time
 rajkot main 28 aktubar ko purv vitt mantri pi
 Addressing a meeting of businessmen, Chidambaram said, "the answer to a parallel economy lies in making the system more efficient
" 
 
 notebandi karnaa nahin
 This is how the demonetisation happened, if i have a mosquito in my house, then i will burn the whole house
 "jaankaar maanate hai ki aane vaale ekaadh saal main notebandi kaa asar or saaf dikhegaa
 One thing that is clearly visible is the progress towards formalization of the economy — a result of the government's stated agenda of greater transparency in financial transactions (hence increasing tax compliance)
 philhal, is kadam se saamaanya jan main yah sandesh gaya he ki aisa ''bhrasht logon ke khilaphy kiya gaya tha
 From this it appears that the voter has turned towards the BJP
 iskaa udhaaharan march, 2017 main uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii jeet he
 This election was held only a few months after the demonetisation, which meant that the dissatisfaction emerging from the cash crisis against the BJP must have been at the time
 jahaan tak sarkaar kaa sawaal he, vah notebandi ko kaamyaab bataa rahi he, baavjood arabiai kii is report ke ki band kii hui mudra kaa 99 fisadi laut aayaa he
 It simply meant that the whole exercise had fallen on its face, but Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it was never his purpose to seize the money
 unhone sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa—8 november, 2016 ke baad hui tikhi aalochana ke chalate jo viksit hua—ki is kavayad kaa uddeshy arthvyavastha kii nakadi par nirbharta ko kam karnaa tha
 The scope of the taxpayers was to be enlarged and the digitization of the tax system encouraged
 unhone agast main kaha tha, ''ab pratyaksh or apratyaksh kar chukaane waalon kii ''sankhya zyada hui he, jaisaa ki nijee iskar daakhil karne waalon main 27 fisadi ke ijaphe or pehle maheene main jiesti kii ugaahi se spasht he
 Now our tax base is wide, cash is underutilized and the informal economy has consolidated
 "lanki digitalykaran kaa ek aayam desh bhar ke kaarobaariyon ke liye sirdard ban chukaa he
 That is, a lot of data can be processed in a few hours with the help of a computer
 kar anupaalan ke maamle main to dasiyon hajaaron soochnaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa hota he, jaise iskar kii ghoshnaa, bank khate, panjikaran form, swaamitv ke dastavej or digital vinimay vagairah
 It is only after comparative study of these that the conclusion is reached whether they are correct or not
 is kism ke ''big data" analysis se ''shell" companiyon jaise kanoonee nuskhon ko bhi ujagar kiya ja saktaa he
 These are companies that exist only on paper and whose job is to hide the identity of the real owner of the asset or money
 iske saath hi duusari sandigdh gatividhiyon, jaise ek company ke kai bank khaaton, khate main achaanak jamaa hui raashi, achaanak nikaali gai raashi vagairah ko bhi aasaani se pakadaa ja saktaa he
 In September this year, with the help of this, the government canceled the registration of 200,000 companies and sealed their bank accounts on suspicion of being "shell"
 reporton ke mutabik sarkaar do saal yaa usase zyada vakt se niskriy padi in companiyon dwaara jamaa karai gai raashi kii jaanch kar rahi he, jinaki kul keemat 1 arab dollar ke aasapaas he
 Government sources speak of 28,000 companies that jointly operated about 50,000 accounts in 49 banks in the country
 jis din notebandi kaa elaan hua, in khaaton main sanyukt shesh raashi 2600 karod ru
 was
 agle din se lekar in khaaton ke band kiye jane ke bich 10,000 karod ru
 More than Rs
 kai anya companiyaan aisi pai gayi, jo prayek 100 se zyada khate rakhe hue thim
 More than one lakh directors of suspected shell companies have also been identified as suspects
 shaayad yahi vajah ho ki vitt mantri jetali ko arabiai ke paas laute paise kii chintaa na ho or shaayad isi vajah se sarkaar ne notebandi ke shuruaati lakshyon main digitalykaran kaa naam na liya ho
 As a finance ministry official points out, all the money deposited in banks after 8 November last year cannot be called white
 unhone bataaya, ''ab koi bhi nakadi benami nahin he
 Identification has been established and the Income Tax Department will pursue them through Big Data
 " jaahir he, galat tareeke se kamaaye gaye paise ko chupaane ke or tareeke viksit kar liye jaaenge, lekin philhal bhartiya arthvyavastha ke andhere konon main is kavayad ne thodi roshni daalane kaa kaam beshak kiya he
 Prime Minister Modi said in his Independence Day address, "more than 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is more than their declared wealth
 unhen is baat kaa jawaab dena hoga ki unhone yah sampatti kahaan se arjeet kii
 "he told that a quarter to two lakh crore
 se zyada jamaa raashi par nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he or sarkaar ne 800 karod ru
 Anonymous property has been confiscated
 notebandi ke shuruaati kaarnon main digitalykaran ko nahin ginavaaye jane kaa ek or kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki 9 november, 2016 or uske baad kai saptaah tak kai logon ke paas koi or vikalp hi nahin tha
 For this reason, digital payments grew perhaps 300 percent in the first week after demonetisation
 yah vruddhi is saal bhi jari he
 Interim data from RBI suggests that digital payments between August and September this year13

 ''view this post on instagramin an ever changing world, it's difficult for mothers to keep abreast about everything
 The one way to better prepare ourselves is to learn from each other's struggles
 i believe these experiences are crucial
 Sharing it with other moms is not only a quickfire way to keep updated but also to share your struggles with those who understand what you're going through
 We received a ton of stories from mothers all over the country
 While some reiterated the importance of some 'me time', others spoke about the pressure of having 'know it all'
 But the one common sentiment was that, parenting is a collective effort
 a mother should be able to say # mujhesabnahipata / # ididntknow without feeling guilty
 So to get more mothers involved in this dialogue, i spoke to some tough moms who accepted that they didn't know it all and bravely shared their stories
 You too can inspire other moms to speak
 So don't be afraid to share or to ask
