 The internal dispute of the Aam Aadmi Party has increased
 sutron ke mutabik piesi se nikaale jane ke baad aam aadmi party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini se bhi yogendra or prashanth bhushan ko nikaala ja saktaa he
 According to sources, this decision can be taken in the meeting of the party's National Council on March 28
 is baithak se pehle party netaa manish sisodiya, gopal raay, pankaj gupta or sanjay singh ne bayaan jari kar prashanth bhushan shanti or yogendra yadav par hamalaa kiya he
 These are the charges of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan in the AAP statement that it is sad that when all the workers were sweating, these senior leaders of our party were trying to weaken the party and defeat the party
 jo log party ko chandaa dena chaahate the, prashanth bhushan ne un logon ko bhi chandaa dene se roka
 Yogendra Yadav published negative news in the newspaper to tarnish Arvind's image
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki awam bijepi kii hi sanstha he or prashanth bhushan ne iskaa samarthan kiya tha
 i welcome the statement by 4 colleagues
 Begins the possibility of open, transparent dialogue
 Truth shall prevail
 — Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra)march 10, 2015hope this statement ends all slander, planting of allegations
 Hope no more coercion of party functionaries and Delhi mlas on this issue
 — Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra)march 10, 2015hope PB and my response will also be duly publicised by the party media
 Hope party's website will be opened for all volunteers responses
 — Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra)march 10, 2015bayaan ke aakhir main kaha gaya he kirashtriya kaaryakarinine bahumat se donon varisht saathiyon ko party kii piesi se mukt karke nai jimmedaari dene kaa nirnay liya
 The party was not saying this openly earlier, but after seeing the efforts of these three, the party has decided to make this decision public
 darasal aam aadmi party ne teenon netaaon ke bare main bayaan jari kiya tha
 It said that the party did not make public the reasons for the removal of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the PAC, thinking that it would adversely affect the personality of both of them, but after the meeting, an atmosphere is being created by making consistent statements in the media
 For example, the National Executive took this decision in an undemocratic and irresponsible manner
 media ko dekhakar kaaryakartaaon main bhi yah sawaal uthne laga he kii aakhir inako piesi se hataane kii vajah kya he
 Forced against the party being created in the media environment, the party is being forced to make public the reasons for the removal of the two senior colleagues from the PAC
 party ke netaa sanjay singh ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki jis prakaar se mayank gandhi bhai ke blog or prashanth, yogendra yadav tivi intervyuu de rahe hai, kaaryakartaaon main galatfahami thi
 Prashant Bhushan used to defeat the Aam Aadmi Party, why did he want to win the BJP? Who followed this thing, Yogendra gave a lot of interviews, what should be the truth
 prashanth bhushan ne piesi kii meeting main kaha ki is party ko barbaad kar do
 The kind of statement that came from his side caused a lot of damage to the party
 ashish khetaan se prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki 20-22 seat aae to aravind kejariwal kaa dimag thik ho jayega
 The party will decide on the decision that will be taken
 raajnneeti main ek party kaa vivaad duusare liye ke hamale kaa aujaar hota he
 In such a situation, how can the other parties stay behind this ruckus of the Aam Aadmi Party
 congress or bijepi ne is maamle par kejariwal and company par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 bjp's Shazia Ilmi said that Arvind Kejriwal is everything in the Aam Aadmi Party
 in sabase bich aam aadmi party ke popular netaa kumaar vishwaas ne kaha he ki party kii baithak main nirnay hua tha ki shant rahanaa he, lekin sabhi log jis tarah se bol rahe hai ye thik nahin
 Nobody is a big leader or small is above discipline
 party ke forum main baat rakhen, ham dobaaraa baith sakate hai, piesi main baith sakate hai
 On any issue, one can initially agree and disagree

 com / 51eoytzm6g — ANI (@ani_news) February 29, 2016 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa mandir darshan paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke aae nateezon se safal hota dikh rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi visited several temples one after the other during the election campaign of five states
 isse bijepi ke haath se congress or gandhi parivaar ko anti-hindu or muslimon kii party ke rup main pesh karne kaa mauka chhin gaya
 'brand Modi' in danger before ailan-e-jung 2019 But also did not let the game stand
 paanchon rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke campan kii shuruyaat se lekar ant tak rahul gandhi kii temple ran jari rahi
 Rahul Gandhi reached Kamalnath Temple in Chitrakoot, Vishwakarma Temple Bhopal, Pitambari Peeth of Datia's mother and Gopal Temple of Gwalior, Achleshwar Temple and Mahakal Temple in Ujjain
 unhone narmada kii aarti main bhi hissaa liya
 Not only this, Congress President Rahul Gandhi recently also undertook the extremely difficult Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
 is yatra ke baad se rahul ko shivbhakt kaha jane laga
 When Rahul visited Chitrakoot, he was also called a devotee
 vahiin, congress ke madhya pradesh adhyaksh kamalnath ne har gaanv main gaushala banane kaa vaada kiya
 The Congress party also started the Ram Gaman Van Path Yatra
 hindi pattee kaa janadesh: ab in 5 sawaalon ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate narendra modirahul ne bataaya tha apana gotrachunaav ke aakhri daur main rahul gandhi ke apana gotra bataane par bhi khub vivaad hua
 Opposition parties often question Congress President Rahul Gandhi's gotra, to which Rahul Gandhi has worshiped himself from Kaul Brahmin and Dattatreya gotra in Pushkar's Brahma temple
 isse pehle karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main rahul gandhi khud ko janeudhari brahman bataa chuke hai
 On the other hand, the BJP has put the brightest face of Hindutva and UP CM Yogi Adityanath in the campaign of all the electoral states
 haalanki, is baar bijepi kaa hindutv card nahin chalaa or rahul gandhi ke mandir darshan ne congress ko bijepi se aage laakar khadaa kar diya
 Many analysts believe that the Congress can only answer the bjp's Hindutva card with soft Hindutva
 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad congress apni secular kii chhavi se nikalakar soft hindutv kii taraf badhati najar bhi ai he
 Congress strengthened, mandate opened by the grand alliance; Gujarat assembly elections began: Temple Darshan - During the Gujarat assembly elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been continuously on the path of soft Hindutva to fight the hard Hindutva of the BJP
 gujarat main rahul ne kareeb 28 mandiron main jaakar maathaa teka tha
 During the election campaign, Rahul Gandhi also described himself as a devotee
 rahul gandhi ke gujarat main somnath yatra ke dauraan vivaad hone par congress ne rahul kii janeu vaali tasviir jari kii thi
 In the Gujarat elections, the party benefited from the political formula from Rahul's temple
 yahi vajah he ki congress ne rahul ke mandir darshan yatra ko karnataka main bhi aajamaaya, yahaan congress bhale hi sabase badi party ke rup main ubharkar nahin aa saki, lekin bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane main kaamyaab rahi

 This is because the rebel leader of the RJD party was defeated by Ram Kripal Yadav, who joined the BJP
 bihar ke gramin ilaakon main langik samanta ke liye, ve mahila shashaktikaran, balika shiksha, mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh, raajnneeti main mahilaon kii bhagidaari or nitigat maamalon main misa bharti dilchaspee leti hai
 She is also interested in travelogues, history, culture and geopolitics of countries
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 se pehle patliputra seat par ram kripal yadav kaa naam rajd kii ore se tay mana ja rahaa tha, magar ain vakt lalu prasad yadav ne ram kripal yadav ko tikat na dekar misa bharat ko tikat de diya, jiske baad ram kripal yadav baagi ho gaye or bijepi ne maukey kaa phayda uthaakar unhen tikat diya or vah patliputra se jeet kar loksabhaa pahunch gaye
 Now from the picture that has been revealed so far in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is clear that this time too there will be a contest between Misa Bharti from RJD and Ram Kripal Yadav from BJP

 The kite of Gujarat is incomplete without the Manjha of Bareilly

 Now it has reached 500 crores

 sakate main daalane vaali baat ye he ki naksaliyon ne pichley kuch maheene se apane nishane par sena or police ke saath-saath aam janata ko bhi le liya he
 In the last one year, Naxalites have carried out eight attacks in which life is known only and only to the common people
 isse saaf hota he ki ab khatra aam janata ke liye zyada bad chukaa he
 Not much time has passed when on May 17, Naxalites blew up a bus in Chhattisgarh with a bomb blast that killed 40 people
 isse pehle bhi naksali maharashtra, jharkhand or chhattisgarh ke kai hisson main 22 april 2009 tak 8 hamalon main 58 begunaahon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuke hai
 It is being said that the anger of the Naxalites is against the government's Operation Greenhunt
 ab tak ke ghatnakram ke baad ye saaf ho chukaa he ki sarkaar naksaliyon par lagaam lagane ke apane mishan main naakaam rahi he
 An even greater danger is that this red conspiracy that has become a cancer for the country is turning its hands red with the blood of the common people

 tu ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale or anya muddon samet maujuuda raajnneetik paridrishy par charchaa karne ke liye makapa ke sheersh netaaon kii is shuukravaar ko yahaan ahm baithak hogi
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury has said that Raja has dragged the Prime Minister in the spectrum allocation dispute in his statements and the truth will be revealed only after a joint parliamentary committee is examined
 bhakpa ke di raja ne kaha ki agar sarkaar is mudde par koi nirnay nahin karti to vipaksh jepisi kii maang uthaane ke liye baadhya he
 This is also because the Supreme Court is questioning the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ko jepisi kii maang maan leni chahie
 Referring to the 2G spectrum allocation scam, BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said, "the story is not going to end with the resignation of a Raja in this case as not only Raja is involved but there are others too
" pradhanmantri manmohan singh or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko sthiti spasht kerani chahie
 AIADMK Supremo Jayalalit in Chennai said that nothing less than a joint parliamentary committee of the 2G spectrum allocation scam was approved
 jayalalita ne apane bayaan main kaha, ‘yah samaj se pare he ki dramuk pramukh em karunanidhi iskaa virodh kyon kar rahe hai
 If Raja says that he is not guilty, then why does Karunanidhi object to the investigation of JPC
 ’baharhaal, 2 ji spectrum aavanton ghotaalaa maamle par pradhanmantri kii chuppi par ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara kii gai tippanee ko lekar utsahit vipaksh ke guuruuvaar ko sansad main sanyukt sansadeey samiti se jaanch karaane kii maang ko lekar apane abhiyaan ko or tej kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 The opposition is adamant on the JPC probe into the matter
 jabaki sarkaar is baat par jor de rahi he ki is mudde par jepisi kaa koi matlab nahin he or sansad kii lok lekha samiti is maamle main sachaai kaa pataa laga sakati he
 At the same time, the opposition says that the PAC only audits the case while the jpc's jurisdiction is large and there is scope for recommendation on administrative reforms by investigating corruption

 This was about a year ago
 us samay pradesh main chunaav chal rahe the
 On 26 July 2019, Aarti, together with Shweta Vijaya Jain, started a technology company with a capital of Rs 10 lakh
 is nai company kii ek puraani company ke saath partnership karai gai
 The old company was based in Bangalore and worked in the field of cyber technology
 is company kaa maalik bhi ab maamle kii jaanch kar rahi agenciyon kii radar par he
 Aarti and Shweta Vijay Jain's company had cyber security, cyber forensics and mobile security but in reality there was something else to be done here
 puraani company se partnership kaa nateeja ye hua ki in nai company kaa dakhal bhopal main bhadbhada road par sthit sibar mukhyalay tak ho gaya
 Through this company, the phone and chatting of politicians and officers started to be monitored
 chating, esemes ke saath kol record kiye gaye

 This alliance was then monitored

 After that, the case of Harbhajan Singh, Superintendent Engineer in Indore Municipal Corporation, came to light
 pehle se hi is maamle par nigaah jamaaye hue sarkaar ne is puure hanitrap gang kaa khulaasa kar diya
 After this, the members of the Honeytrap gang were questioned, so the government was surprised by the revelations in it
 isamen bijepi ke netaaon ke saath congress ke netao ke bhi naam nikal kar aae
 These three cases seem different in view, but somewhere their wires are connected
 jisamen ek senior ipies hanitrap kii kadi main gahare tak judaa hua najar aa rahaa he
 To know more about this matter, see: MP Honey Trap Case: bjp's demand for CBI investigation, Congress had clearly targeted Honeytrap? In fact, on September 18, the Indore police arrested two women and their driver
 ye mahilaayein nagar nigam ke ejeeniyar harbhajan singh kaa video banane ke baad use blackmel kar usase teen karod rupee maang kar rahi thim
 When they came to collect 50 lakh rupees as the first installment of the amount demanded, they were caught
 uske baad kai netaaon ke taar is cond se judate chale gaye
 The picture which is coming out later related to this scandal is shocking
 saath hi is baat kaa ahsaas kara rahi he ki rajya main beete kai varsho main karodon ke theke un logon ke haath lag gaye, jinhone mahilaon kaa bharpoor istemaal kiya
 The investigation of the case has now been handed over to the SIT (special Investigation Team)
 iske saath hi sattadhari dal congress or vipakshi dal bijepi ke netaaon ke naam is hanitrap sex cond se judane lage hai
 So far, the police have not raised any finger on any leader, but the discussion in the corridors is that the leaders of the Honeytrap sex scandal have had relationships with women
 kya isse kai netaa-afasaron kaa kariyar ho saktaa he barbaad?police ke haath jo suraag haath lage hai, ve is baat kaa khulaasa karte hai ki hanitrap sex cond main sirf paanch mahilaayein nahin hai, balki unke giroh ke sadsy chote jilon tak faile hue hai, jinka samay-samay par apane tarah se upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Earlier, the contract or other work was made to please the concerned leader or officer and the money was used to collect money by threatening to blackmail him, which could not work
 itnaa hi nahin bade afasaron kii posting main bhi ye mahilaayein badi bhoomika nibhaati thim
 To know more about this matter, see: Babulal Gaur was the first victim of Honey Trap, BJP had played the game: Congress sources claim that if the investigation is correct and political interference is not there, the faces of many such leaders and officers will be exposed, Those who have a long career in their respective fields and they are currently in a prominent position
 jin logon ke naam saamne aa rahe hai, unamem congress or bhaajapa donon dalon se jude netaa badi sankhya main hai, police ke haath 100 se zyada video or 200 se zyada aise phone number lag gaye hai, jo siyaasi tufaan khadaa kar sakate hai
 There is only one right step between life and death
 aap jahaan bhi hai vahaan se galat mude to ye jivan khatm bhi ho saktaa
 i am not saying this to myself, but the film Hotel Mumbai has taught me today
 saal 2008 main 26 november ko mumbai main hue us dardanaak aatankwaadi hamale main bhula paanaa aaj bhi logon ke liye mushkil he
 Especially those who stayed in Mumbai, who somehow saved themselves from that attack and who saw people dying in front of them
 ye sab vahiin log hai jinaki jindagi kii ek shaam ne unase sabakuch chin liya or hameshaa se liye sab badal daalaa
 The story of the film Hotel Mumbai is inspired by the 2009 documentary Surviving Mumbai
 ye kahani he 26 november 2008 main hue taj hotel main hue dardanaak aatankwaadi hamale kii, jisamen hotel ke mehmaan, staff or mumbai police ne apni jane ganvaai thim
 Along with this, the film also shows some extent of the terror attack on Chhatrapati Shivaji Station and Leopold Cafe on the day of 26 November
 film ke diarector anthony maras ne apane bahut se intervyuu main bataaya he ki unhone hamale ke samay hotel main rahe asal logon kii pahchaan ko chupaane kaa faisle kiya tha or isliye kahani main dikhaae gaye sabhi kirdaar kaalpanik hai, jinhen asal jindagi ke logon se prerit hokar gadha gaya he
 However, the character of Anupam Kher, the head chef of Taj Hotel, Hemant Oberoi, is real
 kahani:kahani kii shuruyaat hoti he arjuna (dev patel) se jo mumbai main rahata he
 Her wife is pregnant and she also has a young girl
 arjuna taj hotel main kaam karne vaala karmchaaree he, jo us din galat footvier main kaam par pahunchataa he
 The head chef Oberoi asks him to go home, but he requests him that he needs this shift, let him work
 vahiin david dancan or jaharaa (army haimer or naajaneen bonaidi) apane bete or uski naini saili (tilda kohm-harvi) ke saath hotel pahunchate hai
 David and Zahra are having dinner at the hotel's canopy when a terrorist attack takes place on the Taj Hotel
 shandaar he diarectionye film bahut khubsuurati se banaai gai he
 Every scene is full of fear and horror, which forces you to pray your mind
 aatankwaadiyon kaa bade aaraam se mumbai tak pahunchnaa or phir aam janata main ghul-mil janaa or taxi lekar apni-apni lokation par pahunchnaa bahut daraavna he
 As the film progresses, the incident at the Taj Hotel becomes even more serious, painful and frightening
 theatre main baithe hue ek pal aisa nahin hota jab aap thik se saans le rahe ho
 This film connects you with yourself in such a way that you will feel that you are in that room of the hotel at that time and death is standing outside as a 16 year old child
 aap kirdaaron ke saath judate he or unke har kadam ko apana kadam samajhakar sochate hai
 Injury to that character becomes an injury to your body
 diarector anthony maras kii bataur diarector pehali film he or unhone isamen badhiya kaam kiya he
 There is hardly any moment in the film when you are not attached to it and do not be afraid
 film kii editing bahut khubasurat he
 The fine cinematography, sound design and background score make the film real
 kisi he parformens:film ke actors dev patel, anupam kher, army haimer, naajaneen bonaidi, tilda kohm-harvi or jacob ijac ne badhiya parformens di he
 Their fear, confusion and panic is worth watching and the acting of all of them makes this film great
 aap ise dekhte hue aap apni imotions or apane aansuon ko nahin roak paaenge
 Overall, this is a beautifully made film which you must watch

 At the same time, the number of MBA seats in the country increased from 95,000 to 3,50,000

 But the quality of MBA education could not increase this fast
 yah usee tarah kii beemaari he jisase bharat kaa puraa hair ajukeshan sector grasit he
 Supplies have been increasing to meet the rapidly growing demand, but due to lack of quality control, the condition is that millions of young people in India have degrees, but they are not fit

 So in this case, the institutes that are lagging behind will have to make their ideal home-based institutions which are flourishing despite all the obstacles present in India

 Similarly, their contribution to global growth rate will be more than 66 percent

 With markets in the US, Europe and Japan now stagnating, it has become unavoidable for world trade to focus on rapidly growing and emerging economies

 If this is true, which is possible only when the Indian government does not stall any obstacles, then India and China will become the centers of global economic activity

 Choosing characters is a challenging task for a satirist
 isliye ki vyangy main gambhirtha bani rahani chahie, visangatiyon kaa rekhankan hona chahie
 This work has been difficult in all times
 par jis daur main ham hai, us daur main vyangyakaron ke liye charitra bahutayat main hai
 If a little creativity is put in, one to one brilliant characters stand in front of us

 How close satire can be to truth - it is revealed through this novel
 upanyaas main ek charitra he—dayaldas gupta, iske bare main upanyaas main zikr kuch yun he, dayaldas ji vinodpriy vyakti the or unki kaaryastylee adbhut thi
 The first principle of his life was - live and let live

 According to a note prepared by Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of Reserve Bank of India, many banks also agreed to give all kinds of unsecured loans
 ek daur main bank is baat ke liye bhi taiyaar hue ki chaahe to pariyojna main pramotor yani nijee kaarobaari kam rakam lagaae, zyada rakam bank kii lagegi
 a promoter told Raghuram Rajan that the banker himself used to come and speak to the promoter
 There is a blank checkbook, the amount to be filled, filled, will be found
 koun se banker rahe honge aise bainkon main, is sawaal kaa jawaab dayaldas gupta jaise charitron main miltaa he
 More than one character is in Bank of Polampur
 upanyaas main ek charitra hai—bhuralaal bhurani, inkaa zikr kuch yun hua he upanyaas main, bank main ek prabandhak bhuralaal bhurani ghoosekhori ke liye mashhoor the
 One day the poor man who repairs shoes came to him for a loan of Rs 5,000
 bhurani ji rin kii raashi sunakar hansate-hansate lot-pot ho gaye, badi mushkil se hansi thami to bole, "are nadaan tuune kahawat suni hogi, nanga nahayega kya or nichodega kya?paanch hajaar ke rin main se mujhe kya de paaegaa or bache hue se tu kya kar legaa? main tuje pachaas hajaar kaa rin detaa hum,? 5,000 mujhe de janaa
 "poor agreed and Bhurani Ji signed a document of fifty thousand rupees and gave 45 thousand rupees
 yah baat alag he ki vah garib 45 hajaar rupye kii badi rakam ko sambhaal nahin paaya
 He misused the amount and could not repay the loan
 yah upanyaas aise charitron se bharaa he ki padhakar hairat hoti he ki aise sach par aadhaarit charitron se bhare puure tamaam sarkari bank dub rahe hai, yah to aashcharya kaa vishay nahin he
 The question is how were they going so far
 bank of polampur kii ek charitra hai, sudhaa natarajan
 Who wanted to show her "joining" in any condition to achieve seniority
 duryog se jis din madam ke "bank of polampur'' main niyukti ke aadesh hue, ve uttar-purv rajyon kii saiyr par thim or vahaan "bank of polampur'' kii koi shakha to dur, atm bhi nahin tha
 Ganesh Madhavan, an old expert in personnel affairs, advised that the bank had given money for a accessible toilet in Shillong under "corporate Social Responsibility" (CSR)
 yadi nai emdi sudhaa natarajan uskaa daura, nirikshan yaa istemaal kar le to ise unki bank kii joining maan liya jayega or unki seniority shuru ho jaaegi
 For his records and security, he took a receipt of five rupees and kept it there
 aisi raseed varishthata ko lekar nyaayalay main vivaad hone ho jane par mahatvapurn dastavej siddh hoti he
 On the basis of such strong characters, the foundation of the hollowing Bank of Polampur has been laid
 bank of polampur dub gaya
 And Polampur is not just in the novel
 sachaai kai baar kalpana se zyada maarak or pechdaar ho jaati he
 This is what the character of Bank of Polampur consistently says
 aane vaale kai barason tak is upanyaas ke charitra banking jagat kii sachaaiyon kii pole kholte rahenge
 Many of the characters in this book stand up and say as if you are saying eye to eye - beware what i called imaginary

 The Supreme Court has given relief to Mayawati in the case of Eco Park being built in Noida
 court ne park main murtiyon lagane par roak lagane se bhi philhal inkaar kar diya
 Earlier, a public interest litigation was heard in the Supreme Court against the Mayawati government on 29 June in the case of Ambedkar Park, built in Lucknow
 adaalat ne upi kii mayawati sarkaar ko is maamle main kaaran bataao notice jari kiya tha
 Mayawati built Ambedkar Park in Lucknow with great passion, in which she burnt 1200 crore rupees only for the installation of idols

 Union Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne bhi is maamle main mayawati kii aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki behatar hota agar ye paisa garibon par kharch kiya jaataa
 Money was also shed like water when Ambedkar Park was built in Lucknow
 sirf murtiyon par 1200 karod rupee phoonk die
 But now Mayawati can feel some relief because the Supreme Court has refused to ban her idols at present
 Only hard work can lead you to your dreams

 in dinon yah santhaan apane nae diarector ke chunaav ko lekar charchaa main he
 In view of the controversy over the appointment of the post of FTII chairman and the changing and important role of communication in the coming times, a person who understands the role of communication is expected to be appointed to this post
 vaise yah chunaav isliye bhi ahm he, kyonki isi diarector ke kaarykaal main is santhaan ke sanchaar vishvavidhyalay main badale jane kii sambhaavna he
 In view of all these aspects, on which basis the director of this institute should be decided, on this we talked in detail by CP Singh, Professor of University School of Mass Communication, Indraprastha University
 - desh ke pramukh media santhaan main jald hi nae diarector kii niyukti honi he
 What would you like to see in a person who is in this position? Often, directors in such institutes do not think very far and just go away with their tenure
 lekin maujuuda daur ko dekhte hue hamen bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan main kai gunon vaala diarector chahie
 He has gone out of the media industry, academics and administration on his own and being energetic as well as keeping a close watch on what is happening in the country, only then he can create a national and international level of communication professionals for the country Will be able to create a competent institution
 sirf prashasan or academix yaa industry vaala bhavishya kii jaruraton ke lihaaj se shaayad hi kaam kaa sabit hoga
 This is the experience so far
 - aane vaale samay main IIMC ko communication uniwarsity banaae jane par vichaar chal rahaa he or ho saktaa he ki yah isi diarector ke kaarykaal main ho jaae
 In such a situation, expectations from the director will be even more
 
 
 bilkul
 Before i say anything else, i would like to give an example of China
 china ne jo communication uniwarsity taiyaar kii he, vah world best he
 Its model has been prepared by China in view of its needs, in which students will also be prepared in such a way that they can further contribute to the image-making of China
 hamaare yahaan jo yah nayaa sanchaar vishvavidhyalay banegaa, vah aam vishvavidhyalay se hatakar hoga
 And the capabilities of the director should also be measured on the basis of these challenges
 bharat main abhi 50 se zyada vishvavidhyalayon main maas communication padhaayaa jaataa he
 At IIMC itself, students from 80 developing countries come for training
 aise main sochane vaali baat yah he ki nae vivi kaa makasad turat-phurat naukari ke liye taiyaar rangarut paidaa karnaa hoga yaa phir 10 se 15 saal baad industry va samaaj kii jarurat or bharat ke nae sandarbhon ko dekhte hue jaankaar dena! jaahir he, hamen aaj kii jarurat nahin, aane vaale samay main sthitiyon ko sanbhaalane vaale visheshgy is vishvavidhyalay se nikaalane honge
 - Let us understand your point that we are weak about strategy
 
 
 beshak
 We are not very big-minded about the strategy
 santhaan kaa makasad sirf kuch naukari laayak patrkaar paidaa karnaa hin nahin he balki aise profeshnal paidaa karnaa he jo samaaj or media industry kii sirf vartmaan jaruraton ko puri karne tak apane ko simit na rakhen or jinke liye communication kaa matlab sirf patrakarita na ho
 How should the people of India talk to the people of India that tomorrow we can become better citizens
 
 
 desh kii tamaam vividhtaon ko dekhte hue hi hamen is vishvavidhyalay kaa aadhaar rakhana he
 What will make the country's image, what will deteriorate, how to keep the country's strong side at the international level, they are all part of this strategy
 samraat ashok kaa udhaaharan dekhen
 He spread his peace message in every way available at that time, in such a way that everyone forgot that thousands of lives were lost in the Kalinga war, after which the emperor chose the path of non-violence
 america ko dekhen- duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad vahaan ke patrakaron ne jo bhi kiya lekin kabhi desh kii chhavi ko kharaab nahin hone diya
 Iraq was attacked, arguing that there were dangerous weapons threatening world peace
 lekin kuch haath nahin laga
 Yet America was not deterred
 yahi communication stretiji kaa kamaal he, jisamen ham peeche hai or isi ke export hamaari jarurat hai
 - On this basis, what other expectations do you expect from a new director? We have to understand above all the small things that even skill and knowledge will not work
 tabhi main kahata hum ki naye diarector ko industry or academy field ke anubhav ke saath-saath doordarshee or shodh drushtih sampann bhi hona chahie
 Just one more director named, no need of the hour
 vah doordarshee ho, research jaanata ho or use desh-duniya kaa gaharaa anubhav bhi ho
 That is, for this post we need a mountain with five equal vertices, which should not fall prey to the system
 vahiin vah students ko patrakarita kii mashin na banaaen, balki isse hatakar sanchaar kii takat ko samajhe or doordarshita ke saath desh kii chhavi ko sudhaarney kaa kaam karen! nayaa diarector aisa ho jo na sirf bade sapane dikhaae balki use puraa karne kaa jajba bhi rakhe
 Give us the expert who brought the facts and truth to the fore
 pichley 50 saal main yahaan se 80 deshon ke patrkaar nikle hai
 Connecting with them may be useful
 - course strecchar ko lekar aapaki kya raay he?mere hisaab se to IIMC main teen str par course hone chahie - pehla skill level ke, duusare in-sarvice se jude or tisare hai level stretgic research
 In the first level, for conducting professional courses, in the second people who are working in the communication line should be given more training and in the third, national and international level research should be conducted
 maujuuda daur main yahaan bas pehle hi str par kaam chal rahaa he
 At the same time, teachers will also have to move ahead with the idea of fulfilling the needs of the industry
 unako desh ke saath apana sapana jodna hoga
 Walking with the youth, we ourselves will understand what kind of communication strategy we need
 yahaan main diarector se ummid karata hum ki vah urjavan hone ke saath hi sapane dikhaane vaala ho
 Dreaming paves the way to move forward
 bahut khatarnaak ho jaataa he sapanom kaa mar janaa, isliye nayaa diarector khatarnaak sapane khatarnaak tareeke se dikhaae or unako puraa karne kaa jajba bhi rakhe
 - Recently, the issue of director's age also arose
 ise 65 se ghataakar 60 saal kar diya gaya he
 What would you say? According to me this is correct
 IIMC ek nae vivi main badalegaa
 It needs a director who is a learner, not a runner, a Flexbill, a challenger, not a compromise, he has a livelihood with experience, a passion to do something, a passion that is with the institute Enhance the image of the country
 vaise videshon main yah umr seemaa 55 saal nirdhaarit kii gai he
 They believe that by this stage people have given their intelligence

 com / qwtxzdklku— Anatoly Zak (@russianspaceweb)december 21, 2017 Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) plans to transform the Sangh from a cultural organization to a social service NGO through about 1,60,000 projects across the country
 unhone aresas kii sabhi ikaayiyon ko nirdesh diya he ki ve kisi-na-kisi tarah kaa saamaajik kaam karen kyonki ''samaaj ke alpasuvidha praapt varg tak pahunchane kaa ekmaatr rasta yahi he
 "at present, around 750 ngos affiliated with the RSS are working under different names
 bhagwat ne in gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon ko rashtriya seva bharti naamak ek sheersh sanghathan ke antargat laane kii yojana banaai he
 Social work is known as service work in the inner fringes of the RSS and has been emphasized in the history of this 87-year-old organization
 sangh apane saamaajik kaary ke tahat chatravaas, awasaiya vidhyalay or swasthya centre chalaata he
 These projects are mainly run in remote areas of each state
 in pariyojnaon kii dekharekh ke liye sangh ne ek alag shakha banaai he
 a senior RSS official involved in the planning strategy told India Today that Bhagwat has decided to work out of the box to change the perspective of the organization
 us padaadhikari ke anusaar, yojana main shaamil log un yuvaaon ko sanghathan kii taraf aakarshith karne kii koshish kar rahe hai jo apni jadon se katnaa nahin chaahate or parivartan laane ke icchhuk hai
 "the youth who have just become voters are neither concerned with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement nor do they remember Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as Prime Minister
 ve aarthik sudhaar chaahate hai, lekin paryaavaran kii keemat par nahin
 They do not want to break away from the traditions but also want to modernize with it
 hamaari ummiden inhen yuvaaon par tiki hai
 Bhagwat wants to extend social work related projects to Naxal-affected areas of the country
 unhone is saal aktubar se prakritik sansadhano par adhikaar ke liye abhiyaan chalaane kii yojana banaai he
 According to that officer, "the RSS has already made some good contacts in Naxalite-affected areas
" ham sthiti par najar rakh rahe hai or hamane kuch sutara bhi bana liye hai
 In those areas, an RSS unit can start work soon
 ''sangh ke pramukh prachaarak manmohan vaidya sweekaar karte hai ki saamaajik kaam par sanghathan kaa dhyaan pehle se adhik he
 But they insist that their main goal is character building
 unhone india today se kaha, ''hamen maaloom he ki hamaare samaaj ke kai varg khaadya, shiksha or swasthya ke buniyadi adhikaron se vanchit hai
 According to him, the RSS is working in four key areas - education, health, social empowerment and economic empowerment
 ''in kshetron main 93,421 jagahon par lagbhag 1,31,578 prakalp chal rahe hai
 Bhagwat is emphasizing on social work to preserve the identity of the Sangh
 haalanki sangh kaa kahana he ki deshbhar main 55,000 jagahon par uski ikaiyaan hai or dakshin main uske sadasyon kii sankhya teji se bad rahi he, lekin uski shakhaon main aane waalon kii sankhya lagaataar sikudti ja rahi he
 An insider said, "the number of social projects in the RSS is increasing nowadays, the graph of other things is going down
 '' janvari main mumbai main yojit padaadhikariyon kii baithak main unhone kaha, ''shakha mahatvapurn he, lekin saamaajik gatividhiyaan bhi utani hi mahatvapurn hai
 Social activists welcome the initiative of Jatin Desai Bhagwat, as well as warn that if the Sangh maintains its fundamentalist ideology, then everything will go in vain

 com / pxaofdq4za Haryana Police is engaged day and night in an attempt to break the tradition of Dera Sacha Sauda
 lekin dere kii kor team ke shaatir log police ko gumraah karne main kaamyaab ho jate hai
 Be it Honeypreet or Vipassana
 sutron kii maane to police vipashyana ko giraftaar karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 After which many important secrets related to Ram Rahim and Dera can come out
 deraa sachcha sauda kii kii cheirpersonvipashyana insaki mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai
 On one side, the sword of arrest is hanging on his head and on the other he is in danger of life from the Dera gang
 vivaadit deraa sachcha sauda kii cheirperson vipashyana ab buree tarah se fansati dikh rahi hai
 On one side there are wells, on the other side there is a moat
 sutron kii maane to police vipashyana ko jald giraftaar kar sakati he
 He is accused of misleading the police and hiding information
 esaiti team ko jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki panchkula main hinsa bhadakaane kii sajeesh rachane vaali team main vipashyana bhi maujuud thi
 Police had traced the location of mobile phones of more than 20 people including Honeypreet and Aditya Insa in Sirsa
 usamen vipasana kaa mobile phone bhi shaamil tha
 However, the police have not revealed the call details of all the 20 people
 lekin haniprit, aditya or vipasana ke mobile phone kii lokation kaa khulaasa ho chukaa he
 The same thing can prove to be a big problem for Vipassana
 25 agast ko rape cese main faisla aane se pehle haniprit ne 17 agast ko sirsa main ek baithak bulaai thi
 It included all the big faces associated with the Dera Gang
 police sutron ke mutabik is baithak main panchakula hinsa kaa blueprint taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It was decided in this meeting that if the verdict came in favor, Ram Rahim would do satsang and if the verdict went against Ram Rahim, then violence would spread in Panchkula
 iske liye deraa gang ke khaas logon kii ek suchi taiyaar kii gai thi
 In which many places in Panchkula were entrusted to increase the number of dera lovers, to control and to incite a riot
 is kaam ke liye haniprit or aditya ne ek hafte pehle panchkula kii reki kii thi
 In such a situation, there are two ways in front of Vipassana
 lekin donon hi raah aasaan nahin he
 Due to lack of critical evidence related to the Panchkula violence, the police now wants to make Vipassana Insa a government witness
 vipashyana ko sarkari gavaah banane se giraftaar ke khatre se to nijaat mil sakati he lekin aisa karke vah sidhe sidhe dere ke khoonkhaar gang ke target par aa sakati he
 Vipassana now has a well on one side and a ditch on the other side
 vah na to giraftaar hona chaahati he or na hi sarkari gavaah ban kar deraa kii mukhaalafat karnaa chaahati he
 It is learned that the Dera gang has also prepared a strategy ahead of Vipassana's arrest
 uski giraftaar ko lekar sirsa main ek gupt metig hui he
 In which it has been decided that if Vipassana Insa is arrested, the new Dera team will immediately take command
 vaise haniprit kii tarah hi vipashyana ko bhi shaatir mana jaataa he
 This is the reason that despite all the inquiries the police have not been able to extract anything special from him
 jabaki baba auki haniprit ke gunahon kii kai kadiyaan vipashyana par aakar ruukti hai
 According to sources, Vipassana has full knowledge of the wealth and treasures of the Dera
 jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki haniprit insa ke nirdesh par vah deraa ke check sin karti thi
 She was fully aware of the disputed meeting of 17 August but on October 13, when she appeared before the Panchkula police, she gave a roundabout reply to the meeting
 itnaa hi nahin sutron kii maane to 25 agast ke din vipashyana insa ne hihaniprit insako deraa pahunchane main madad kii thi
 He had arranged for a carriage to send Honeypreet from Rohtak to Sirsa
 police sutron ke mutabik vipashyana insa ko maaloom tha ki haniprit insa ne deraa ke biometric taale kholkar vahaan se nakadi, jameen ke kagajaat or bainkon se jude dastavej gaayab kiye the
 Vipassana has been summoned to appear before the Panchkula and Sirsa sits a total of 5 times so far but has been able to appear before the police only twice
 usne teen baar beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaakar police se mohalat maangi thi
 The police suspect that Vipassana produced false medical certificates thrice to avoid questioning as all these certificates were issued from Dera Hospital in Sirsa
 police ab in medical certificate kii jaanch bhi karavaaegi
 The police has been taken several times and is preparing to take Vipassana to Sirsa
 use jald hi saman dekar poochtacha ke liye esaiti ke saamne bulaayaa jayega
 Vipassana Insa will be questioned about the deletion of evidence of Dera's crimes and the Panchkula violence and the police can arrest her if she breaks up again
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne ab tel keemton main badhotaree ke liye bharat, china or brazil ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The Republican Party has been consistently blaming the president's failed energy policies in this election year for the rise in oil prices, and presumably Obama has made such a statement to quell these criticisms

 amuman har videsh daure ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi 'man kii baat' karte hai
 Every time Modi is on a foreign tour after 'mann Ki Baat'
 or is tarah 'man kii baat' or 'videsh daure' main aisa rishta banataa he jisaki jhalak donon main baari-baari milti rahati he
 The Prime Minister has recently returned from a trip to three countries - and the next 'mann Ki Baat' is to be on the show weekend, which has already been recorded

 Such is the achievement of such officers that the life of the common man has been improved
 aise adhikari band daravaajon ko kholane kaa kaam karte hai, muddon ko sulajhaate hai or hameshaa logon kaa phayda dekhte hai
 At the same time, in his second tweet, Sultan Sheikh Mohammed writes that other types of officials, 'often underestimate things
 aam aadmi kii jindagi ko aise adhikari behad kathin bana dete hai
 Such officers also get happiness when there is a crowd of needy people at their doorsteps
 yueike sultan ne apane duusare twit ko khatm karte hue likhaa he ki aise hi deshon or sarkaron ko safalataa milti he jahaan pehle kism ke adhikariyon kii sankhya duusare kism ke adhikariyon se bahut zyada ho

 The people of the bride side had left no stone unturned in welcoming the wedding processions
 sabhi baaraati naachte gaate hue dwarchaar ke liye pahunch rahe the
 When the procession reached the door, when the bride came to see the groom through the window with her friends
 
 
 iske baad to baraat main hangaamaa khadaa shuru ho gaya
 The bride said this is someone else
 
 i will not marry him
 maamla bihar ke jile sitamarhi ke gaanv kohbarava kaa maamla he
 According to the bride, it is a duplicate groom
 iske baad to naaraaz parijanon gaanvvaalon ne puri baraat ko gher liya
 Meanwhile, someone asked to catch Bichwani but he had already escaped seeing the opportunity
 media report ke mutabikpuri raat baraat ko graminon ne bandhak banaakar rakhaa, somvaar kii subah panchayat bulaai gai jisamen faisla hua ki ladakevaalon ne dhokhaa kiya he isse vadhu paksh ko lakhon ko rupye kaa nuksaan hua he ab isaki bharpai duulhaa paksh ke log karenge
 After this, the procession was allowed to go after paying the account of everything
 aapako bataa den ki baraat mujffarpur jile ke golgamaa gaanv se ai thi
 When the groom saw the groom riding on the chariot, his senses flew, he told his sister-in-law that the boy whose picture was shown was not this boy
 iske baad usne shaadi se saaf inkaar kar diya
 After seeing the photo, Mukesh Sah, the bride's brother, started to understand that someone had been cheated
 khaas baat yah thi is shaadi ke madhyasth duulhe kaa chachera bhai vikaas saah tha
 The comments duulhe ne bataaya ki uskaa bhai suresh raay or vikaas saah patna main kisi mithai kii dukaan main kaam karte hai or vah chennai main naukari karata he
 According to the groom, Vikas has shown another picture for the wedding
 yah puri galati uski he
 Not only this, when the villagers talked to the hostages of the hostages, it was found that the caste card was also changed in the wedding card
 saah ke badale raay chhapavaya gaya tha
 At the same time, the groom says that he has no idea about this
 in sab baton ke baad 1 lakh rupaya dene ke baad duulhepaksh ke logon ko chhod diya gaya
 Let us tell you that the procession came from Golgama village in Muzaffarpur district
 dulhan ne jab rath par savaar duulhe ko dekha to uske hosh ud gaye usne apni bhabhi se bataaya ki jis ladke kii tasviir dikhaai gai thi vah yah ladkaa nahin tha
 After this, he flatly refused to marry
 photo dekhne ke baad dulhan ke bhai mukesh saah ko puraa majara samaj main aane laga ki kahin koi dhokhaa hua he
 The special thing was Vikas Sah, the cousin of the groom who was the moderator of this marriage
 tippaniyan The groom told that his brothers Suresh Rai and Vikas Sah work in a sweet shop in Patna and he works in Chennai

 She is getting sick from conscience

 Politics is done in the field, not on the blog

 In this connection, Dhoni and Sushant have also met in a hotel in Mumbai

 Anyway, after Dhoni's demand of 45 crores, the question of getting the film was raised
 akhbaar ne dhoni ke ek dost ke hawaale se likhaa he, 'dhoni ke paas bisisiai kaa farmaan maanane ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he
 Already, questions were being raised about the future of this film financially
 film kaa bajet 100 karod se upar chalaa gaya tha
 Firstly, it will be a sports-based drama film, even if it is about cricket, but its audience is very less
 lekin asli adnga bisisiai ne daalaa
 Even if the film is made, we will have to wait for Dhoni to retire

 BJP leaders UP President Laxmikant Bajpai, Kalyan Singh, Vinay Katiyar and many leaders and activists were present in this conference

 Amit Shah will be in Varanasi on Wednesday, where he will inaugurate the office of Narendra Modi
 amit shah ne kaha, 'upi kii janata ne jo janadesh loksabhaa chunaav main diya, mujhe laga tha isse sapa or mulaayam singh sanbhal jaaenge
 Here it turned upside down

 jiyang ne kaha, china or pakistan mitra padosi hai or sabhi maamalon main vyapak sahyog main lage hai
 As far as the cooperation project you discussed, i have not heard about it
 chini pravaktaa ne kaha, in vashren ke dauraan china ne apni kshamta ke hisaab se pakistan ko sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Jiang said, "we hope that this aid will help Pakistan improve its standard of living and achieve sustainable economic and social development and we will continue to do so in the future

 Jiang's remarks contradict Pakistani Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhtar's statement that the Chinese government has accepted Pakistan's request to take over the operation of Gwadar Port as soon as the terms of the agreement with the Singapore Port Authority are over
