yah tarkeeb kaam kar gai
 
 
 Soad shares her thoughts online about how Islam views all people, including women, as free and equal
 
 
 iske alaava udaarvaad kii raah main unke dimag main aae idia bhi
 
 
 That is the reason, the words, and the pictures too, the battle started
 
 
 dadhi vaale purushon kii tasviren post karne ke baad desh main based sheersh dharmaguruon or anya paramparawaadiyon ne soad al-shaimari ko paakhandee, naastik, dhoort or shaitani qaraar diya
 
 
 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile
 
 
 soad ke chote bhai fyez ke mutabik, samudaay ke ek netaa ne ek baar use kaha tha, "tum to mard hi nahin ho
 
 
 How can you allow your sister to behave like this? 
 
 " Fyz said that he had left Haile for about seven years, because the taunts had been out of tolerance
 
 
 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya
 
 
 After the younger brother cooped up Soad for his 'antics', the feud with him escalated to such an extent that the two brothers finally reached the hospital
 
 
 fyez bataata he, shuruyaat main to yaara ne bhi soad kaa virodh kiya
 
 
 The children in school also used to taunt Soad's sons, after which they used to come home and vent their anger on their mother
 
 
 28 oktober, 2014 ko soad al-shaimari ko hiraasat main lekar jedda kii briman jail ke mahila wing main rakhaa gaya
 
 
 He was accused of inciting public sentiments
 
 
 lekin us par kabhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya gaya, vah kabhi doshi qaraar nahin di gai
 
 
 Even behind bars, Soad al-shamri did not stop 'advocacy', and she continued to tell women that music was allowed in Islam
 
 
 iske alaava vah mahilaon ko unke kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main bhi bataati raheen
 
 
 She says that after that women Muslim missionaries started coming to the jails more than before, and told the women who were there that they wanted to be there
 
 
 jail main laga tivi hameshaa dharmik channel 'majd' (majd) par hi chalata rahata he
 
 
 He was released from custody on January 29, 2015
 
 
 unhen apane saamaajik gatividhiyon ko kam karne ke vachan par dastakhat karne pade, or unke ek purush sambandhi, unke bhai fyoz se unki rihaai ke kaagazat par dastakhat karwaae gaye
 
 
 Even after that, she keeps writing messages for her 207,000 followers on Twitter, but says she now chooses her words more carefully than before
 
 
 tippaniyan Yara now supports her mother's activities, although she still wishes that her mother should not argue against the hijab, and argue against influential religious leaders
 
 
 yaara kahati he, "unase mujhe bahut himmat milti he
 
 
 They have suffered all that you cannot afford
 
 
 " Divorced 42-year-old Soad al-shamari, who spoke about women's rights, posted pictures of several bearded men, including a traditionalist Jew, a hippie, a communist, a Turkish caliph, a Sikh, and a Muslim
 
 
 soad al-shaimari ne in tasveeron ke saath likhaa ki sirf dadhi rakh lene se koi vyakti pavitra yaa muslim nahin ho jaataa
 
 
 He also pointed out that during the time of Prophet Mohammad, one of the most staunch critics of Islam had a longer beard than the Prophet
 
 
 islamic kanoon main snaatak kii degree hasil kar chuki chah bacchon kii maa soad al-shaimari ke liye is tarah kii bebaak tippaniyan karnaa koi nai baat nahin he
 
 
 Born into a religious family of a large clan, Soad may have grazed sheep as a child, but is now a liberal activist demanding women's rights, and often challenging the powerful religious authority of Saudi Arabia with his arguments about Islam 
 
 
 apane vichaaron kii soad ko keemat bhi chukaani padi he
 
 
 She has spent three months in jail without any formal charge 'for instigating public sentiments'
 
 
 sarkaar unki videsh yatraaon par pabandi laga chuki he
 
 
 His online forum 'free Saudi Liberals Network' co-founder and blogger Raf Badawi is serving a 10-year prison sentence, and he was also publicly lobbied for 50 lashes
 
 
 soad ke pita saarvajanik rup se unhen beti sweekaar karne se inkaar kar chuke hai
 
 
 But all this was not enough to suppress the voice of Soad al-shaimri
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "mere paas kuch adhikaar hai, jo mere hisaab se mere dharm ke khilaaf nahin hai
 
 
 i want to demand those rights, and want those who make decisions, listen to me and then do something
 
 
 " Women Islamic scholars and activists in Arab countries have long demanded a fresh interpretation of Sharia laws that give equal status to men and women in front of God
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kaa shumaar saudi arab main sabase zyaada awaz uthaane vaali tathaa sakriy dharmik tathaa mahila adhikaron kii pairokaron main kiya jaataa he
 
 
 Sohad Nasif, a friend and fellow activist of Soad, says, "he (soad al-shamri) has complete confidence in what he says, and he is not hesitant at all
 
 
 vah arab prishthbhumi se hai, registani maahaul se
 
 
 She is proud of her background, but due to this background she becomes somewhat dry with everyone, and is very dry expressing her views
 
 
 " Raised as the eldest of 12 children of a farmer in the Haile province, Soad al-shaymari cared for the sheep
 
 
 vah na sirf dharmik thim, balki 'salaafi' (aisa musalmaan, jo islamic kanoonon kii shabdic vyakhya ko jyon kaa tyon sweekaar karata or maanata he) ke rup main rahati thim
 
 
 Soad al-shamari became a public school teacher after earning a bachelor's degree in Islamic law from the University of Haile
 
 
 17 saal kii umr main soad ne apane hi kabeeley ke apane se doguni umr ke purush se shaadi kii thi, or phir ek beti - yaara - bhi hui
 
 
 Soad got divorced at the age of 20, and they remarried
 
 
 soad kii duusari shaadi hil ke usee chif jaj se hui, jisane unke talaak ke maamle ko dekha tha
 
 
 After this, the war of rights for Soad al-shamri began on the day his daughter was snatched from him
 
 
 jaise hi yaara saat baras kii hui, soad ke pehle pati ko uski castady saunp di gai
 
 
 Since Soad had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should stay with her father instead of living with another man
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "jab unhone use (yaara ko) mujhase liya, or kaha 'yahi allaah kii marzi he' or 'yahi islam he', thik usee vakt mere andar vidroh kii chingaari sulag uthi
 
 
 It is not possible that there is such a God in the world, who will tolerate this injustice and suffering just because i am a woman
 
 
 " She could not even see her daughter, so for eight years she fought with her parents, her community and everyone who came between her and her daughter Yara
 
 
 bhavaheen chehre ke saath haath baandhe baat karti hui soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "main pagal-si ho rahi thi, lekin apane mata-pita ke saamne, apane jaj pati ke saamne, or unke aasapaas maujuud hamaare samudaay ke logon ke saamne, mere naam or samudaay main meri jagah kii vajah se mujhase ummid kii jaati thi ki main chupchaap baithi sab kuch dekhati rahun
 
 
 " duusari shaadi se soad al-shaimari ko paanch santaanen huin, lekin uske baad jald hi uskaa phir talaak ho gaya
 
 
 When Yara's father became ill, and his grandmother passed away, Yara's father, who was 16 years old, finally allowed him to live with his mother, and Soad al-shaimri was more lenient with all six of his children
 The visiting cities settled in Jeddah
 
 
 sharia kanoon kii apni jaankaree ko soad ne zaruuratmand auraton kii kanoonee salaahkaar (legal adwiser) ke rup main istemaal kiya
 
 
 Sometimes his advice was less pious, more full of treachery and shamelessness
 
 
 ek baar unhone apni ek mitra ko salaah di ki vah pataa kare ki uske cese ko koun-sa jaj dekh rahaa he, phir kuch mechap kare, or jaj ke saamne ro-rokar taarikh aage badhaane kaa aagrah kare
 
 
 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism
 
 
 bas, yahi kaaran rahaa shabdon, or tasveeron kii bhi, jang shuru ho gai
 
 
 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga
 
 
 According to Soad's younger brother Fayez, a community leader once told him, "you are not a man at all
 
 
 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image
 
 
 chote bhai dwaara soad ko uski 'harkaton' ke liye kose jane ke baad uske saath hua fyez kaa jhagada is kadar badha ki aakhirkaar donon bhai aspataal pahunch gaye
 
 
 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted

 vah arab prishthbhumi se hai, registani maahaul se
 
 
 She is proud of her background, but due to this background she becomes somewhat dry with everyone, and is very dry expressing her views
 
 
 " Raised as the eldest of 12 children of a farmer in the Haile province, Soad al-shaymari cared for the sheep

 Soad al-shamari became a public school teacher after earning a bachelor's degree in Islamic law from the University of Haile
 
 
 17 saal kii umr main soad ne apane hi kabeeley ke apane se doguni umr ke purush se shaadi kii thi, or phir ek beti - yaara - bhi hui
 
 
 Soad got divorced at the age of 20, and they remarried
 
 
 soad kii duusari shaadi hil ke usee chif jaj se hui, jisane unke talaak ke maamle ko dekha tha
 
 
 After this, the war of rights for Soad al-shamri began on the day his daughter was snatched from him
 
 
 jaise hi yaara saat baras kii hui, soad ke pehle pati ko uski castady saunp di gai
 
 
 Since Soad had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should stay with her father instead of living with another man
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "jab unhone use (yaara ko) mujhase liya, or kaha 'yahi allaah kii marzi he' or 'yahi islam he', thik usee vakt mere andar vidroh kii chingaari sulag uthi
 
 
 It is not possible that there is such a God in the world, who will tolerate this injustice and suffering just because i am a woman
 
 
 " She could not even see her daughter, so for eight years she fought with her parents, her community and everyone who came between her and her daughter Yara
 
 
 bhavaheen chehre ke saath haath baandhe baat karti hui soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "main pagal-si ho rahi thi, lekin apane mata-pita ke saamne, apane jaj pati ke saamne, or unke aasapaas maujuud hamaare samudaay ke logon ke saamne, mere naam or samudaay main meri jagah kii vajah se mujhase ummid kii jaati thi ki main chupchaap baithi sab kuch dekhati rahun
 
 
 " duusari shaadi se soad al-shaimari ko paanch santaanen huin, lekin uske baad jald hi uskaa phir talaak ho gaya
 
 
 When Yara's father became ill, and his grandmother passed away, Yara's father, who was 16 years old, finally allowed him to live with his mother, and Soad al-shaimri was more lenient with all six of his children
 The visiting cities settled in Jeddah
 
 
 sharia kanoon kii apni jaankaree ko soad ne zaruuratmand auraton kii kanoonee salaahkaar (legal adwiser) ke rup main istemaal kiya
 
 
 Sometimes his advice was less pious, more full of treachery and shamelessness
 
 
 ek baar unhone apni ek mitra ko salaah di ki vah pataa kare ki uske cese ko koun-sa jaj dekh rahaa he, phir kuch mechap kare, or jaj ke saamne ro-rokar taarikh aage badhaane kaa aagrah kare
 
 
 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism
 
 
 bas, yahi kaaran rahaa shabdon, or tasveeron kii bhi, jang shuru ho gai
 
 
 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga
 
 
 According to Soad's younger brother Fayez, a community leader once told him, "you are not a man at all
 
 
 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image
 
 
 chote bhai dwaara soad ko uski 'harkaton' ke liye kose jane ke baad uske saath hua fyez kaa jhagada is kadar badha ki aakhirkaar donon bhai aspataal pahunch gaye
 
 
 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted
 
 
 salaakhon ke peeche rahakar bhi soad al-shaimari ne 'vakaalat' band nahin kii, or vah mahilaon ko bataati raheen ki islam main sangeet kii ijazat he
 
 
 Apart from this, she also kept informing women about their legal rights
 
 
 vah bataati hai ki uske baad mahila muslim mishanri pehle ke mukaable jelon main zyaada aane lageen, or vahaan band mahilaon ko bataane lageen ki unka vahaan hona khuda kii marzi he
 
 
 Jail TV always operates on the religious channel Majd

 He had to sign a pledge to curtail his social activities, and one of his male relatives, his brother Fayose, was signed on his release documents
 
 
 iske baad bhi vah twitor par apane 207,000 folunron ke liye sandesh likhti rahati hai, lekin unka kahana he ki ab vah pehle ke mukaable zyaada saavdhaanee se apane shabd chunati hai
 
 
 The comments yaara ab apni maa kii gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karti he, haalanki uski khwaahish aaj bhi yahi he ki kaash, uski maa hijaab ke khilaaf bahes na kare, or prabhaavshaalee dharmik netaaon se bahes na kiya kare

 jaise hi yaara saat baras kii hui, soad ke pehle pati ko uski castady saunp di gai
 
 
 Since Soad had remarried, the court ruled that the girl should stay with her father instead of living with another man
 
 
 soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "jab unhone use (yaara ko) mujhase liya, or kaha 'yahi allaah kii marzi he' or 'yahi islam he', thik usee vakt mere andar vidroh kii chingaari sulag uthi
 
 
 It is not possible that there is such a God in the world, who will tolerate this injustice and suffering just because i am a woman
 
 
 " She could not even see her daughter, so for eight years she fought with her parents, her community and everyone who came between her and her daughter Yara
 
 
 bhavaheen chehre ke saath haath baandhe baat karti hui soad al-shaimari kahati hai, "main pagal-si ho rahi thi, lekin apane mata-pita ke saamne, apane jaj pati ke saamne, or unke aasapaas maujuud hamaare samudaay ke logon ke saamne, mere naam or samudaay main meri jagah kii vajah se mujhase ummid kii jaati thi ki main chupchaap baithi sab kuch dekhati rahun
 
 
 " duusari shaadi se soad al-shaimari ko paanch santaanen huin, lekin uske baad jald hi uskaa phir talaak ho gaya
 
 
 When Yara's father became ill, and his grandmother passed away, Yara's father, who was 16 years old, finally allowed him to live with his mother, and Soad al-shaimri was more lenient with all six of his children
 The visiting cities settled in Jeddah
 
 
 sharia kanoon kii apni jaankaree ko soad ne zaruuratmand auraton kii kanoonee salaahkaar (legal adwiser) ke rup main istemaal kiya
 
 
 Sometimes his advice was less pious, more full of treachery and shamelessness

 This trick worked
 
 
 islam kis tarah mahilaon sahit sabhi logon ko paidaaishi azaad or ek samaan dekhtaa he, is bare main soad apane vichaar online saajha karti hai
 
 
 Apart from this, ideas also came to his mind in the path of liberalism

 After posting pictures of bearded men, top religious leaders and other traditionalists in the country termed Soad al-shaimri as hypocritical, atheist, sly and devilish
 
 
 unka munhfat swabhaav or tivi tok sho main hijaab ke bina unka nazar aana hil main unke parivaar ke liye dikkatein paidaa karne laga
 
 
 According to Soad's younger brother Fayez, a community leader once told him, "you are not a man at all
 
 
 tum apni bahan ko is tarah kaa bartaav karne kii ijazat kaise de sakate ho
 
 
 " fyez ne kaha ki lagbhag saat saal ke liye usne hil chhod diya tha, kyonki taane-ulahne bardaasht ke baahar ho gaye the
 
 
 The relationship that came to her from another clan also broke down only because of her sister's image

 In the beginning, Faira tells, Yara also opposes Soad
 
 
 skool main bachche bhi soad ke beton ko taane maarthe the, jinke baad ve ghar aakar apni maa par apana gussa nikaalte the
 
 
 On 28 October 2014, Soad al-shaimri was detained and placed in the women's wing of Briman prison in Jeddah
 
 
 us par janabhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane kaa aarope tha
 
 
 But she was never prosecuted, she was never convicted
 
 
 salaakhon ke peeche rahakar bhi soad al-shaimari ne 'vakaalat' band nahin kii, or vah mahilaon ko bataati raheen ki islam main sangeet kii ijazat he
 
 
 Apart from this, she also kept informing women about their legal rights

 He had to sign a pledge to curtail his social activities, and one of his male relatives, his brother Fayose, was signed on his release documents
 
 
 iske baad bhi vah twitor par apane 207,000 folunron ke liye sandesh likhti rahati hai, lekin unka kahana he ki ab vah pehle ke mukaable zyaada saavdhaanee se apane shabd chunati hai
 
 
 The comments yaara ab apni maa kii gatividhiyon kaa samarthan karti he, haalanki uski khwaahish aaj bhi yahi he ki kaash, uski maa hijaab ke khilaaf bahes na kare, or prabhaavshaalee dharmik netaaon se bahes na kiya kare
 
 
 Yara says, "they give me great courage
 
 
 unhone vah sab jhela he, jo aap nahin jhel sakate
 
 
 " uniwarsity of hil se islamic kanoon main snaatak kii degree lene ke baad soad al-shaimari public skool teacher ban gayi
 
 
 At the age of 17, Soad married a man twice as old as his own clan , and then had a daughter - Yara
 
 
 20 saal kii umr main soad kaa talaak ho gaya, or unhone phir shaadi kar lee
 
 
 Soad's second marriage to the same chief judge of Haile, who had seen his divorce case
 
 
 iske baad adhikaron ke liye soad al-shaimari kii jang us din shuru hui, jis din unki beti ko unase chin liya gaya
 
 
 As Yara turned seven, her custody was handed over to Soad's first husband
 
 
 chunki soad duusari shaadi kar chuki thim, so, adaalat ne faisla diya ki kisi duusare purush ke saath rahane kii jagah bacchee ko uske pita ke saath rahanaa chahie
 
 
 Soad al-shaymari says, "when they took him (yara) from me, and said, 'this is the will of Allah' and 'this is Islam', right then the spark of rebellion ignited in me
 
 
 aisa ho hi nahin saktaa ki duniya main aisa koi khuda he, jo is ninsaphi or takalif ko sirf isliye bardaasht kar legaa, kyonki main ek aurat hum
 
 
 " vah apni beti ko dekh bhi nahin sakati thi, so, aath saal tak vah apane mata-pita, apane samudaay ke alaava apane va apni beti yaara ke bich aane vaale har shaks se ladati rahi
 
 
 Talking handsomely with a proud face, Soad al-shaimri says, "I was getting mad, but in front of my parents, in front of my judge husband, and in front of the people in our community around them, Because of my name and my place in the community, i was expected to sit quietly watching everything
 
 
 " Soad al-shaymari had five children from his second marriage, but he was divorced soon thereafter
 
 
 jab yaara ke pita biimaar ho gaye, or uski daadi guzar gayi, tab 16 saal kii ho chuki yaara ke pita ne aakhirkaar use uski maa ke saath rahane kii ijazat de di, or soad al-shaimari apane sabhi chah bacchon ke saath zyaada udaar kahe jane vaale shahar jedda aa bases
 
 
 Soad used his knowledge of Sharia law as a legal adviser to women in need

 Once, he advised a friend to find out which judge is looking into his case, then put on some make-up, and cry in front of the judge to urge him to pursue the date
 
 
 yah tarkeeb kaam kar gai
 
 
 Soad shares her thoughts online about how Islam views all people, including women, as free and equal

 That is the reason, the words, and the pictures too, the battle started

 His blunt nature and his appearance without a hijab on TV talk shows started to cause problems for his family in Haile
 
 
 soad ke chote bhai fyez ke mutabik, samudaay ke ek netaa ne ek baar use kaha tha, "tum to mard hi nahin ho
 
 
 How can you allow your sister to behave like this? 
 
 " Fyz said that he had left Haile for about seven years, because the taunts had been out of tolerance
 
 
 ek or kabeeley se uske liye aayaa rishta bhi sirf uski bahan kii chhavi kii vajah se tut gaya
 
 
 After the younger brother cooped up Soad for his 'antics', the feud with him escalated to such an extent that the two brothers finally reached the hospital
 
 
 fyez bataata he, shuruyaat main to yaara ne bhi soad kaa virodh kiya

 28 oktober, 2014 ko soad al-shaimari ko hiraasat main lekar jedda kii briman jail ke mahila wing main rakhaa gaya
 
 
 He was accused of inciting public sentiments
 
 
 lekin us par kabhi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya gaya, vah kabhi doshi qaraar nahin di gai
 
 
 Even behind bars, Soad al-shamri did not stop 'advocacy', and she continued to tell women that music was allowed in Islam
 
 
 iske alaava vah mahilaon ko unke kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main bhi bataati raheen
 
 
 She says that after that women Muslim missionaries started coming to the jails more than before, and told the women who were there that they wanted to be there

 Even after that, she keeps writing messages for her 207,000 followers on Twitter, but says she now chooses her words more carefully than before

 The misdeeds of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who is serving a jail sentence in the heinous crime of rape, are coming out one by one
 deraa sachcha sauda ashram main ram rahim ke kai raaj dafan hai, jin se aaj paradaa uthegaa
 5000 personnel are deployed for search inside the Dera headquarters at Sirsa
 hoicourt dwaara niyukt jaj kii dekharekh main deraa mukhyalay main search jari he
 It is expected that many secrets will be revealed in this search operation
 adaalat ke aadesh par ram rahim ke haryana main sirsa sthit deraa sachcha sauda mukhyalay main search oparation shuru ho gaya he
 Former High Court Judge AK Pawar has reached the ashram with several top officials and the search is on
 is dauraan puri karrwai kii videography bhi kii ja rahi he
 But before this, Dera has admitted to being a skeleton under the ground
 khudaai ke liye 20 jesibi mashine mangai gai hai
 Amidst fear of finding the ashes of those who were killed and killed in Lashndere, the Dera newspaper 'sach Kahoon' has tried to explain this
 haalanki is koshish main akhbaar ne sweekaar kar liya he kidere main laashen dabi hai
 It is said that by killing those who spoke against Gurmeet Ram Rahim, their dead bodies were buried in the ground inside the Dera Sacha Sauda complex
 haryana police ne kareeb 20 JCB mashiinon se dere ke andar khudaai shuru karvaa di he
 Police are trying to find out the truth of these allegations by digging out suspicious places inside the camp
 isi vajah se deraa sachcha sauda ke akhbaar ne safai di he ki deraa parisar main khudaai ke dauraan dabi hui haddiyaan or asthiyaan mil sakati hai, kyonkigurmeet ram rahiaapane anuyaayiyon ko asthiyon ko nadiyon main bahaane se roka karata tha or kaha karata tha ki asthiyon kaa visarjan karne se pradooshan failata he or nadiyon main gandagi hoti he
 The place of burial at the common death was scheduled
 The newspaper says that followers of Dera Sacha Sauda used to press the ashes into the ground at a designated place in the Dera complex
 deraa sachcha sauda ke purv sevadaar or ek samay gurmeet ram rahim ke behad kareeb rahe gurdas singh ne haalanki bada khulaasa karte hue kaha he ki ab deraa sachcha sauda ko pataa lag chukaa he ki jald hi unka yah sach bhi duniya ke saamne hoga
 Gurdas said, "the bodies of many people who had disappeared from the camp were buried in the premises of the camp itself and their bones and bones can be found when the police will dig through JCB machines
 "isi vajah se sach kahuun akhbaar ke madhyam se deraa sachcha sauda pehle hi is par par apni safai dene par laga he
 Gurdas Singh said, "there was definitely a place to suppress the ashes in the ground, but a place was built far away from the dera premises and a board was also put there
 lekin deraa parisar ke andar jahaan par logon ke shav dabe hone kii ashanka he vahaan par is tarah kii koi vyavastha nahin thi
 If male skeletons, bones and bones are found from that place, then it is clear that people were killed and buried there
 deraa parisar main is tarah kaa koi sthaan nirdhaarit nahin tha or naa hi koi board lagaaya gaya tha
 Mainpuri will have one of the ten seats in UP in the third phase of elections on April 23
 mainpuri seat sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav kaa garh he
 For the fifth time, he has landed in the field from here
 ladaai ke lihaaj se dekhen to le dekar vipaksh ke naam par keval bijepi he, baaki aath choti local partiyaan or nirdaleey ummidavaaron sahit mainpuri main kul 12 ummidavaar kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 The Congress has not fielded a candidate against Mulayam in lieu of concessions in the Rae Bareli and Amethi of the Grand Alliance
 sachai to ye he ki is seat kaa itihaas samaajawaadee party kii sabase majboot seat ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 a generation became young and for the last 24 years no one other than the Samajwadi Party had any luck
 2014 main ‘modi kii hawa’ ke baavjood bijepi ummidavaar shatrughna singh chouhan na sirf haare balki unki haar kaa antar bhi 3 lakh 64 hajaar voton kaa tha
 BSP was third with one lakh 42 thousand votes
 mulaayam ne 2014 main do siton (azamgarh or mainpuri) se jeet hasil kii thi
 He later left the Mainpuri seat to his grandson Tej Pratap
 upachunaav main ek baar phir bataur sapa ummidavaar tej pratap singh yadav ne bijepi ummidavaar prem singh shakya ko 3 lakh 21 hajaar voton se haraaya tha
 However, in this by-election bjp's vote was increased by nine percent while sp's vote was increased by five percent
 mainpuri kii ekatarfa ladaai main bijepi ke prem singh shakya 2019 main ek baar phir mulaayam singh yadav kaa saamana karenge
 If the 2014 results are taken as the basis, after the SP-BSP merger, Mulayam could get around seven lakh votes
 aise main mainpuri main badlaav kii gunjaaish takreeban na ke baraabar he
 The BJP has never won a Mainpuri seat
 1967 main jansangh (bijepi kii purvavarti party) ne pehali baar jagadish singh ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 He got about forty-six thousand
 uske baad bijepi ne agle paanch loksabhaa chunaavon main mainpuri se koi ummidavaar nahin utaara
 Ram Naresh Agnihotri of BJP contested elections in 1991 and finished second with one lakh fourteen thousand votes
 uske baad upadesh singh chouhan ne 1996 main mulaayam singh ke khilaaf chunaav lade, unhe vot to 2
 21 lakhs definitely got, but lost again this time
 mulaayam ke is garh main sapa ke saath-saath unke parivaar kaa dabadabaa he
 In the last five Lok Sabha elections including two by-elections, Mulayam himself has not won any election except for his nephew Dharmendra Yadav and grandson Tej Pratap Singh
 mulaayam paanchavi baar is parampara ko kaayam rakhane kii koshish karne ja rahe hai
 Caste mathematics is considered the biggest reason for Mulayam or sp's victory
 kareeb teraa lakh voters main se 35 fisadi yadav jati se hai jabaki kareeb 29 fisadi voters rajput hai
 This math of the voters shows that defeating the common leaders of Yadavs in UP on Mainpuri seat will be like chewing iron gram

 unke alaava andhra ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu tathaa chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh, ensipi netaa prafull patel va punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal bhi samaaroh main maujuud the
 According to sources, Uddhav Thackeray was called by BJP president Amit Shah, Devendra Fadnavis and Arun Jaitley to accept Uddhav Thackeray, which he has accepted
 pehle shivasena ne gathbandhan sarkaar ke gathan ke liye baatcheet ke dauraan bhaajapa dwaara 'lagaataar apamaanit' kiye jane kaa aarope lagaate hue samaaroh kaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The party currently has 121 seats in the 288-member assembly and it is forming the government as the largest party in the state, although the party will need some more mlas for a majority
 party ne shivasena se gathbandhan par abhi tak koi antim faisla nahin liya he
 Thackeray's presence at the ceremony indicated that the alliance of the two parties, which broke down on seat sharing before the assembly elections, could revive
 samaaroh main sabhi kii nazren modi or uddhav par thim, jinhone haath milaaye or ek duusare se kushalakshem poocha
 Fadnavis is leading a minority government with 121 BJP mlas in the 288-member assembly, which has been asked to prove majority in two weeks
 sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party 41 vidhayakon ke saath pehle hi nai sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan kii peshkash kar chuki he
 Fadnavis becomes the second Brahmin chief minister in Maharashtra dominated by Maratha leaders
 isse pehle shivasena ke manohar joshi isi samudaay se the
 Fadnavis, who was associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and close to Prime Minister Modi, became the 27th Chief Minister of the state and the 18th person to hold the post
 vah mukhyamantri banane vaale vidarbha kshetra ke chauthe netaa hai
 In Maharashtra, when the BJP achieved tremendous success in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections, it was Fadnavis who was heading the party
 uddhav thakare kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ke saath baithe the or shant dikhe, lekin shapath grahan samaaroh samaapt hone ke baad vah modi ke saath haath milakar haalchaal poochhate or muskaraate dikhaai die
 Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut said, 'BJP president Amit Shah called Uddhavji and invited him, after which he joined Devendra Fadnavis' oath
 ' unhone kaha, 'amit shah ne uddhavji ko nayi sarkaar main shivasena kii bhagidaari par sakaaratmak faisle kaa aashwaasan bhi diya or hamen ummid he ki jab baatcheet hogi to sakaaratmak parinaam nikalegaa
 ' baharhaal abhi saaf nahin hua he ki donon dalon ke bich satta main saajhedaari ko lekar paraspar sweekaarya sahmati par pahunchane ke liye baatcheet kab hogi
 Governor Rao has given Fadnavis 15 days to prove his majority in the Assembly after taking oath
 bhaajapa ke navnirvaachit vidhayak govind rathod ke nidhan ke baad sadan main party ke sadasyon kii sankhya 121 rah gai he, lekin party ne sabhi saat nirdaleey vidhayakon or kuch chote dalon ke sadasyon kaa samarthan praapt hone kaa daawa kiya he
 The NCP has said that if the Shiv Sena sits in the opposition during the power test, it will not participate in voting
 isse fadanvis ko aasaani se bahumat sabit karne main madad milegi
 However, to reach the magic figure of 145 in the House, the option of taking the 63-member Shiv Sena along with Fadnavis is considered the best

 Here in the film, many good actors have been wasted on the lines of weak and irrational story on the lines of the industry's ryavat
 isamen kahin-kahin foohad dialog bhi hai or aakhir main ek mahaniatik magar ansabhav sa ant bhi
 'chal Guru Ho Jaa Start' derives its soul, body and energy from the character of all the disputed babas of the country

 Apart from this, all the other knights including Nirmal Baba also have a glimpse in the central character Hariya Baba

 Inspired by a Baba after stumbling rate, he opens a shop of religion and it goes on

 Then finally they are busted and all are bathed in the light of knowledge

 The country really needs such films, which can open the eyes of those who cheer the babes who are surrounded by superstitions, who give their all to them and do anything to protect their interests
 magar film sabase pehle ek film he
 Her story should be strong, not a garbage cocktail
 uske samvaad chutile hone chahie
 It should have the acting acting of the actors
 magar 'chal guru ho ja shuru' isamen se ek bhi khaane par tik nahin lagaati he

 Brijendra Kala is once again seen in the role of Baba's colleague Birju Maharaj, proving his acting iron
 baaki sab actors khanaapurti karte hai
 Whether the film has a background score or sets or cinematography, everything is superficial
 diarector manoj sharma is film main betarah niraash karte hai
 This film has got very few screens

 adil raashid (england)- 676 Anshumala, who has gained fame on the strength of singing classical and folk music in the entire country including Patna, is swinging between life and death today
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya unke prashansak ek baar phir unke suron kii taazgi mahasoos kar sakenge? ab jabaki sarkaar or samaaj anshu kii madad ko aage aae hai to unke prashansakon ko ummid kii kiran dikhaai dene lagi he
 Anshu, a B-grade singer of All India Radio and topper of Miranda House, University of Delhi, has given several classical music programs in 16 languages in different parts of the country, but she has been away from music practice for a full year
 anshu ke donon gurde kharaab ho chuke hai
 Anshu, who has attained immense fame at the age of only 27 years, is unable to speak properly today
 in dinon patna ke indira gandhi ayurvigyaan santhaan (aijimes) main unka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 The government has also taken care of Anshu and assured to pay the full cost of his treatment
 anshu kii maa kiran bala kahati hai ki agar patna ke log saamne nahin aate to shaayad aaj unki beti jivit na hoti
 Anshu, born in a soldier's house and a graduate in music from Patna University and a postgraduate and mphil degree from Delhi University, was married three years ago in Ranchi to his parents' will
 vivaah ke baad anshu ne dilli, mumbai or patna ko chhod apane piya ke ghar ko hi apana thikaana bana liya, lekin vahaan unhen unki gayaki ke kadradaan nahin mili
 There was no atmosphere of his riyas in the in-laws
 vahaan kisi ne unki hausala-afjai bhi nahin kii
 According to family members, when Anshu got pregnant for the first time, one of her kidneys had a problem, but she kept hiding her disease
 jab is saal janvari-farvari main unhen kaaphi pareshaani hone lagi, to unki yah beemaari sabake saamne ujagar ho gai
 Her in-laws also opted out of physically unable help due to illness
 iske baad to maano anshu par dukhon kaa pahaad hi tut padaa
 She later returned to Patna
 patna aane ke baad vah ilaaj ke liye vellore, dilli or lakhanu tak daudin, lekin paise ke abhaav main sahi dhang se ilaaj nahin kara sakin
 He was having trouble with his treatment in Patna
 sarkaar ne anshu ke pita ishwaranand jha kaa jahanabad se patna sthanantaran kar diya he, taaki vah apni beti kaa ilaaj sahi dhang se kara saken
 Jha says that Anshu has received accolades from great people at such a young age, but probably wrote about stumbling in his luck
 vah kehete hai ki vah anshu ke ilaaj main koi kor-kasar nahin chodenge
 Fans of Anshu's singing have also included former President APJ Abdul Kalam, former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's wife Gursharan Kaur
 aijimes ke nideshak arun kumaar kehete hai ki anshu ko gambhir haalat main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, lekin dhire-dhire unki sthiti main sudhaar ho rahaa he
 He says that he is being dialysis
 pehle unhen saamaanya avasthaa main laayaa jayega or phir niyamit ilaaj kiya jayega
 Anshu fans are eager to hear his voice
 logon ko aashaa he ki anshu jarur thik ho jaaengi or unke karnpriy suron ko ek baar phir suna ja sakegaa

 Women have gone on a sex strike for the second time in two years in the small town of Barbacos in southwest Colombia, demanding good roads
 ise 'cross legs movement' naam diya gaya he
 Colombian journalist John Otis reports that women have refused sex with their partners, saying they will continue their strike until their backward and small town roads are connected to other parts of the country

 aapako bataa den ki is sadak kii haalat itani kharaab he ki paas ke aspataal tak pahunchane main hi 14 ghante kaa samay lag jaataa he or kai baar to jaruratmand raste main hi dam tod dete hai
 The women had first sex strike in 2011 against the poor condition of the roads
 tab ek mahila or uske ajanme bachche kii maut ho gai thi kyonki ambulance sadak main funs gai or ve samay rahete aspataal nahin pahunch paae
 At that time, Judge Marybel Silva also joined the strike
 tab hadtaal kii netaa rubi ne kaha tha, 'ham aisi duniya main bacchon ko lekar hi kyon aaen jahaan ve sirf isliye mar jate hai kyonki unhen ilaaj nahin mil paata or ham unhen moolbhoot adhikaar tak nahin de sakate? hamane faisla kiya he ki jab tak sadakon kii haalat thik nahin hoti tab tak naa hi ham sex karenge or naa hi bachche paidaa karenge
 19 days after the strike, two politicians of the city promised that the condition of the roads would be corrected and the government would also construct at least 35 miles of road

 And now the women have gone on strike again

 But he rejected the proposal citing the party's order
 darasal bijepi pehle hi unhen spikar pad ke liye maidan main utaarne kii yojana bana chuki thi
 The party believed that Mukhi becoming a pro-tem speaker would spoil an opposition vote against the government, as the speaker could not vote
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar kii ore se bahumat sabit kiye jane ke baad spikar kaa chunaav aupchaarikta bhar rah gai he

The committee also wants an answer as to why the security agencies did not take steps to stop the attack even after knowing the interaction between the terrorists and their masters? The committee has also sought clarification on whether special forces were used to hide the terrorists inside the airbase
 Apart from this, the committee has raised the question whether New Delhi had raised the demand to send the Pakistani committee to India to investigate the attack
 And what was the stand of the Pakistani government on this

 But you look with your eyes and think with your mind as to whose orders the sticks went, why the confrontation took place

 The students' fight is with the college administration

 enaiti srinagar par aap jitne bhi tathy rakh lijie, aap tak pahonchega vahi jo whatsap ke zariye tarah tarah ke maisejon main dhalkar failaayaa ja rahaa he
 But we'll talk anyway
 hyderabad central uniwarsity ne bhi media ko get ke baahar roak diya
 After several days of ban, 70 students were taken into custody when the students tried to break the barricade on Wednesday
 jeenyu main media ko bheetar jaakar chaatro se baat karne or vahaan se sidhaa prasaaran karne par koi roak nahin thi
 Yet the number of rumors is so high that they have spread everywhere that the media is not going to NIT Srinagar
 aaj bhi hamaari sahyogi nita sharma srinagar gayi thim lekin ijazat nahin hone ke kaaran wo campus ke bheetar nahin ja sakin
 Local students are being allowed to go to the campus from outside but those who are inside the campus are not allowed to go out due to security reasons
 campus ke bheetar internet kii bandwyeth bhi kam kar di gai he taaki soshal cites ke zariye chaatr video baahar nahin bhej saken
 Neeta Sharma said that on Thursday, the girl students also took a march to the gate, but the police parked big trucks in front of the gate so that their pictures could not be found by the media
 phir bhi media ko kuch tasviren to mil hi gayi
 However, the arrival of leaders has also been banned
 kya aapane whatsap ke afvahabaazon ke aise koi sandesh padhe hai ki enaiti campus kii sthiti baahar aa sake iske liye prashasan media ko andar jane de
 Many of you believe without even investigating the facts
 ab ye dosha bhi kya media ke chaar patrakaron kaa he ki campus ke bheetar campus ke shikshakon or diarector ke dar se chaatr chaatraon ko nakaab lagaakar bayaan dena pad rahaa he
 They are afraid that the numbers will be cut when the face is exposed

 Now listen and see
 rajya prashasan kaa kahana he ki jaanch shuru ho gai he or 15 dinon main report aa jaaegi
 The HR Ministry team says that she will stay on campus till the examination is over
 jin chaatro ko janaa he wo is team ko bataa den, unke jane kii vyavastha kar di jaaegi
 All the members are available anytime for anyone who wants to talk to the committee
 iske baad bhi chaatr santusht nahin hai
 Students are saying that our issue is security, do not communalize our issue
 campus ke bheetar inke chehre kyon dhake hue hai, iskaa jawaab enaiti degaa yaa media ke patrkaar jinhen secularavaadi bolkar bhaddi bhaddi gaaliyaan di ja rahi hai
 Should social media gangs not raise the question as to why boys and girls have to hide their face in the campus of the central government institute amidst the security of CRPF and police
 is tasviir main ladkiyaan haath jode khadi hai
 i had not seen such type of request, usually the fists are waved in the performance of the students
