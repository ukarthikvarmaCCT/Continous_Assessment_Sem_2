 He has warned that if the garbage at the Bhalswa landfill site is not stopped, he will oppose it
 mukesh goyal north emsidi ke sabase varisht parshad hai jo record baar parshad kaa chunaav jeet kar aae hai
 According to him, like the Ghazipur landfill site, the duration of Bhalswa landfill site has also been completed
 emsidi us par lagaataar kooda damp kar rahi he, jisase isaki oonchai bhi lagaataar bad rahi he
 At the same time, the risk of accident like Ghazipur has also increased

 An accident like Ghazipur at Bhalswa landfill site is likely because colonies have settled on two sides below this landfill site, where a large number of people live
 yadi kooday kaa pahaad khiskaa to neeche basii aabaadi par girane kaa khatra he
 Apart from this, the pollution caused by repeated fires at this landfill site is also affecting the health of Delhi

 Just a few days before the general election, a painful news has come to the government

 The government is already on target of the opposition over cheap agricultural yields and low growth in jobs

 Unemployment rate in the country 7 during February, 2019
 2 fisadi tak pahunch gai he
 This is the highest ever since September 2016
 farvari, 2018 main berogari dar 5
 Was 9 percent
 siemai nijee kshetra kaa ek pratishthit think tanks he, jiske aankade kaaphi vishwasaneey maane jate hai
 According to the news agency Reuters, the cmie's figures are based on a survey conducted in millions of families across the country
 CMIE ke pramukh mahesh vyas ne agency ko bataaya ki naukari chaahane waalon kii sankhya main giravat ke baavjood berogari kii dar main record badhat hui he
 He said that about 40 crore people are estimated to be employed in February, compared to 40 in February last year
 6 karod ke aasapaas thi
 Significantly, the Lok Sabha elections are to be held in the country between April and May, in such a situation, this figure can be troublesome for the Modi government
 haalanki, sarkaar berogari kii apane str par aankada jari karti he or sarkaar ne baar-baar kaha he ki berogari dar maapne ke puraane maapdand main badlaav kii jarurat he
 Last December, a newspaper report claimed that in 2017-18, the unemployment level reached a record level of 45 years
 akhbaar main daawa kiya gaya tha ki yah eneseso kii li report he
 The CMIE report released in January said that around 1 in 2018
 1 karod log berozegaar ho gaye
 For this, the demonetization made by the Modi government in 2016 and the GST implemented in 2017 were blamed
 sarkaar ne pichley maheene sansad main kaha tha ki uske paas yah aankada nahin he ki notebandi se naukariyon par kya asar padaa he
 Vyas said the labor participation rate in February was 42
 7 fisadi rahi, jabaki janvari main yah 43
 Was 2 percent
 farvari, 2018 main shramik bhagidaari dar 43
 Was 8 percent
 shramik bhagidaari kam hone kaa matlab yah he ki naukari chaahane waalon kii sankhya main bhi giravat ai he
 Adding to this further unemployment rate, the problem deepens
 akhbaar ne tab chapa tha ki neshnal sample survey offis ke dwaara kiye gaye survey ke mutabik saal 2017-18 main bharat main berogari dar 6
 1 percent
 is report ke li hote hi kaaphi vivaad hua tha or vipaksh ko hamalaa karne kaa mauka mila tha
 However, the NSSO has not yet released the unemployment data

 What happened to a mere 13-year-old girl that she made a terrible decision to put her to death
 police ke mutabik madhu maravi kii laash hostel ke kamare ke baahar kaaman bathroom ke paas lataki hui thi
 On getting the information, the police went to the spot and brought down the corpse and investigated Madhu's room
 tab police ko vahaan ek suicide note baraamad hua
 DM and Superintendent of Police also reached the spot after receiving the news of the girl's death
 is ghatana se anya chatraayen bhi sahami hui thim
 The police sent Madhu's corpse for postmortem
 ab police ke haath main wo suicide note tha, jo madhu ke kamare se baraamad hua tha
 The police was proceeding on the same basis
 chaatra ke parijanon ko soochna di ja chuki thi
 Hence, the family members reached the police
 police ne madhu ke kamare se baraamad suicide note uske gharavaalon ko dikhaaya
 Seeing whom the family came in awe
 us suicide note main likhaa he ki madhu ek teacher bananaa chaahati he, lekin jawahar navoday vidhyalay aane par use laga ki vah nark main aa gai he
 But the second twist in the case came when Madhu's family told the police that their daughter was not handwriting in the suicide note
 uske pita ne daawa karte hue he ki unki beti kii maut kaa maamla sandigdh he, lihaaja is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karai jaani chahie
 Madhu's family members said that she was very happy when she came to Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya
 saath hi jis oonchai par faansee lagane ke liye rassi baandhi gai thi
 That too brings the matter under suspicion
 parivaar kaa saaf kahana he ki madhu kii maut aatmahatya nahin he
 The family's claim has become a new challenge for the police who are trying to settle the case easily
 jis maamle ko police mahaj aatmahatya maanakar nipataane kii koshish main thi

 The police want to know if there was any untoward incident with Madhu
 saath hi police ne ab madhu ke kamare se baraamad kiye gaye suicide note kii handriting kaa milan madhu kii handriting se karaane kaa faisla kiya he
 For this, the suicide note is being sent to the handwriting expert

 Pujara is the only new face in the team announced by the Cricket Board's selection committee on Monday
 chayan samiti ke adhyaksh krishnaamchaaree shrikant ne kaha ki team main chayan kaa maandand yogyata pradarshan or fitness thi
 When asked the reason for excluding Yuvraj, Srikanth said, 'we have no specific reason to tell
 mujhe lagata he ki pradarshan or fitness sabhi chizon par gaur kiya gaya
 This is the answer to the question itself
 ’yuvaraj ko ‘shesh bharat’ team kaa captain banaaya gaya he jo ek aktubar se irani cap match main ranjai champion mumbai kaa saamana karegi
 Srikanth said that Pujara has made a place in the national team due to the good performance in the domestic circuit
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley kuch satr main pujaara ne gharelu cricket main kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya he
 He is a good player and has also done well in 'A' series
 usne apane pradarshan ke dam par team main jagah banaai he
 As expected, fast bowler Zaheer Khan, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and s Sreesanth have returned to the team
 jahir ko kandhe kii chot ke kaaran july main srilanka daure par nahin chunaa gaya tha jabaki fitness samasya ke kaaran harbhajan bhi tisare test main nahin khele the
 The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team also has the return of opener Gautam Gambhir, who suffered a knee injury during the first Test against Sri Lanka
 srilanka main balle se damdaar pradarshan kii badaulat suresh raina team main jagah barkaraar rakhane main safal rahe hai jabaki salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag, rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar or vivies lakshmana anya ballebaaj hai
 Tamil Nadu opener Murali Vijay has also got a place in the team as an alternate batsman
 pragyan ojha or amit mishra spin vibhaag main jagah banane main safal rahe hai jisaki aguai harbhajan karenge
 On the other hand, Pujara has done well in domestic cricket and this right-handed batsman has been in the race for a place in the team for some time
 is 22 varshiya ballebaaj ke gharelu cricket main dabadabe kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki usne paanch saal ke apane pratham shrenee karier main 14 shatak or 13 ardhashatak lagaaye hai
 Srikanth said that he and his teammates had chosen a balanced team for the Test series against Australia
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaara ballebaaji kram kaaphi majboot he jabaki gendbaaji bhi acchhee he
 We are confident of a good performance against Australia
 ’timen is prakaar hai:test shrinkhalaa ke liye bhartiya team:mahendra singh dhoni (captain), virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, rahul dravid, sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana, suresh raina, harbhajan singh, amit mishra, jahir khan, ishanth sharma, es srisanth, pragyan ojha, murali vijay or cheteshwar pujaara

 ) When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the relief camp in riot-prone Kokrajhar district on 28 July last, he was astonished to see the absence of a person he hoped to be there - Assam's Education and Health Minister Himanta Bishwa Sarma
 ''himant yahaan kyon nahin hai?'' pradhanmantri ne assam pradesh congress prabharee digvijay singh se poocha
 Manmohan was not the only one to wonder about this
 tarun gogoi ke saal 2001 main mukhyamantri banane ke baad pehali baar sarama kii is tarah se anupasthiti logon ke man main lambey samay se chal rahe is andeh kii pushti karti thi ki vah ab assam ke mukhyamantri gogoi ke sabase vishwast sipahsalaar nahin rahe
 The Chief Minister has become a pathetic figure in this single avatar
 congress haikaman unase naaraaz he
 The national media has cracked down on them and opposition parties are attacking them
 assam kii baraak ghati se aane vaale ek mantri kehete hai, ''sarama unke liye pichley sabhi varshon main sankatmochan rahe hai
 Now we know who was actually running the state
 '' rajya ke ek or congressi mantri kehete hai, ''har sarkari vibhaag main unke vafaadaar hai or puure rajya ke congress kaaryakartaaon main bhi acha samarthan hasil he jisase unhen madad milti he
 "during the 2011 assembly elections, Gogoi campaigned at select places in the state as he was recuperating after heart surgery
 puure rajya main congress ke chunaav prachaar kaa jimmaa sarama ne hi sambhala tha
 Sarma's wife's TV channel News Live is always ahead of her nearest rival
 congress ke liye samarthan jutaney main isaki bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 The rift in relations between Sarma and Gogoi started only when the media started crediting Sarma for the victory in the election and praised his work as Health Minister
 mukhyamantri ke bete gaurav ke raajnneeti main utarane ke baad sambandhon main duuri or badhane lagi
 When most of the ministers ran to greet the 'prince of Assam', Sarma stayed away
 congress ke ek vidhayak kehete hai, ''gaurav yadi kisi mantri ko phone karte hai or unase milanaa chaahate hai to mantri unke ghar pahunch jate hai
 But Sarma politely asks this young leader to come to his home or office
 ''sarama or gogoi ke bich tanaav us samay ahdhail main puri tarah gaharaa ho gaya jab yah khabaren ain ki sarama gupt rup se sonia gandhi se milakar up-raashtrapati ke liye mukhyamantri gogoi kaa naam sujhakar aae hai
 However, Sarma denied this but Gogoi began to grow closer with Forest Minister Rakibul Hussain, who is very close to Gaurav
 june ke ant main manmohan singh ne sidhe sarama ko phone kar assam main baadh ke halaat kii jaankaree lee, tab gogoi 10 din ke daure par america main the
 This proved Sarma's rising status in the Congress court of Delhi once again

 Deputy Inspector General of Lucknow DK Thakur said, Section 302 (murder: and 120B) conspiracy against unknown people today at Gosaiganj police station on the application of his wife Malti Sachan in the death of deputy CMO Sachan under suspicious circumstances in district jail
 An FIR was registered under thakur ne bataaya ki yah praathmiki speed post se gosiganj thane ke prabharee ko bheji gai taharir ke aadhaar par darj kii gai he
 He said that on the direction of the state government, as the case is under judicial investigation, the police will start the investigation of the matter only after the judicial inquiry is completed
 donon jaanch ek saath nahin chal saktin
 Thakur also said that the registration of an FIR in this regard will be intimated to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who is conducting a judicial inquiry into the matter
 shuukravaar ko divangat dipti siemo sachaan kii patni malti sachaan ne unke pati kii maut ke maamle main hatya kii praathmiki darj kiye jane ke liye thakur ko bhi arji bheje jane kii baat kahi thi, magar thakur ne unhen koi arji milane se inkaar kiya
 While rejecting the story of the state government terming Sachan's death as a prima facie suicide, the family of Sachan is demanding a CBI inquiry into the case, which is currently turned down by the state government
 sachaan kii maut ke bare main hatya kaa mukadmaa darj kar liye jane ke baad unke bhai aar ke sachaan ne kaha ki yah praathmiki to pehle hi darj ho jaani chahie thi
 Of late, the police filed an FIR and considered it a case of murder
 unhone saath hi yah bhi kaha ki ve or unke parijan is maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii maang par ab bhi kaayam hai kyonki sabhi jaanate hai ki police kii jaanch kaise hoti he
 Meanwhile YS Pathak, joint director of the medico-legal department of Uttar Pradesh, has claimed that all the wounds found on Sachan's body may not have been inflicted by him himself and prima facie the case is not of suicide but of murder
 unhone kaha ki unke gale par fande ke nishaan se lagata he ki unki hatya ko aatmahatya kii shakl dene ke liye baad main unke shav ko lataka diya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, the late Sachan's son Sankalp Sachan has said, "my father has been killed, because he was about to reveal the names of some people in the CMO BP Singh murder case on the court appearance the next day

 uttar pradesh main ek ke baad ek lagaataar tisare chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The sp's political fort has completely collapsed in Narendra Modi's wave
 jabaki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main akhilesh yadav mayawati ke saath milakar chunavi maidan main utre the phir bhi party ko jeet nahin dilaa sake
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Shivpal Yadav revolted from the SP and formed a separate party and entered the electoral arena, but he could not save his bail
 sapa kii karaari haar par pichley teen dinon se lagaataar manthan ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question is whether Akhilesh and Shivpal will come together after looting everything? The SP, which Mulayam Singh Yadav had laid in UP in the 90s, has completely lost the political ground of that party in the state today
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke baavjood uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav apni party kii karaari haar nahin roak sake
 After this defeat, the churning phase has started in SP
 pichley teen dinon se mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich lagaataar baithak chal rahi hai
 Mulayam has been continuously churning with Akhilesh on the strategy of bringing back the political ground lost by the SP in the churning of the mulayam-akhilesh wave
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki sanghathan main bade str par badlaav kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, there is a lot of discussion that Akhilesh Yadav will give respect to the grassroots leaders running the side line to provide strength to the party again
 iske alaava sapa chhod chuke party ke diggaj netaaon kii dobaaraa party main entry bhi karai ja sakati he
 Will Shivpal return? On the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Shivpal Yadav left Samajwadi Party and formed his own party
 ve firozabad se chunaav lade lekin, shivpal kaa garh kahi jane vaali is seat par ek lakh vot bhi hasil nahin kar paae or unki jamaanat jabt ho gai
 Apart from this, not a single candidate could touch the figure of one lakh votes in the seats in which the candidates of Shivpal Yadav fielded
 is tarah se shivpal ke raajnneetik bhavishya par sawaal khadey hone lage
 If sources close to Shivpal Yadav are to be believed, he is ready to return to the SP
 iske liye mulaayam singh yadav ne unke paksh main batting shuru kar di he
 However, Shivpal Yadav is being blamed for the defeat of Dimple Yadav in Kannauj
 iske liye akhilesh yadav ko kuch audio bhi sunaae gaye hai
 However, it is different that not only Kannauj but SP has been completely eliminated in the state
 basapa se gathbandhan hone ke baad bhi sapa apni paramparaagat seat kannauj, badaayun or firozabad ganvaa baithi
 Like 2014, SP has got five seats this time too, but these seats are Mainpuri, Azamgarh, Rampur, Moradabad and Sambhal
 inamen do par akhilesh or mulaayam singh ne jeet darj kii he, jabaki teen muslim saansad jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 According to sources, Akhilesh Yadav is not ready for Shivpal's entry into SP
 aise main mulaayam singh ne tark diya he ki shivpal yadav sanghathan ke aadmi hai or party ko dobaaraa khadaa karne main ahm role adaa kar sakate hai
 Now it has to be seen whether all the fallen Shivpal and Akhilesh will come together, forgetting the grievances

 During the commentary on the fourth day of the Melbourne Test, Kerry o'keefe has made another controversial statement, which has created an uproar on social media
 fox sports ke liye camentry ke dauraan shen worne ne o'kief ko on air apni ek pareshaani bataai
 Warne told o'keeffe that he had trouble pronouncing Indian names like Indian cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja
 phir kya tha kerri o'kief ne worne ko aisa jawaab diya, jisase vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Mayank Agarwal was running, joking Kangaroo commentatorokeff replied to Warne, 'why would you name your child Cheteshwar, Jadeja
 ' jiske baad unke saathi camentataron ne bhi chutki lee
 Following this racial comment by o'keeffe, fans on Twitter have taken a dig at him
 kuch phens ne to yah tak kah daalaa ki vah is match ke baad camentry karte najar nahin aaenge
 Has o'keefe already decided that he is doing his final commentary stint? Coz this ain't comms
 These are just bad, racist remarks
 # ausvind — Aishu Haridas (@imaishu_) December 29, 2018couldn't agree more
 It's one thing to attempt to humour, however manufactured, but Kerry o'keefe in particular has only made a fool of himself when talking about most things Indian through this series

 o'keefe claimed that Mayank Agarwal might have scored a triple century against 'some canteen staff or waiter'
 aisa kehete hue o'kief ne mayank or bhartiya gharelu gendbaajon kaa majaak udaaya
 However, o'keefe later apologized saying that his intention was not to insult the batsman who was making the debut

 Right now his film 'jai Ho Democracy' is coming
 aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main unhone film ke bare main kai baaten share kin
 
 
 Have you done the film of every genre, now what is this film 'jai Ho Democracy'? Yes, India is a wonderful country and the world's largest democracy, but there are some shortcomings which were not there during the independence of the country
 jis tarah se parliament main bahes hoti he, wo bahut hi dukhadaayi he
 They do not listen to each other, there is shouting, abusive and even beaten
 bengalooru, kashmir, lakhanu main parliament main hui ghatnaon ke upar ye film kataaksh he
 Finally, the message goes that the biggest difficulty can be solved very easily
 film aapke chehre par muskaan ke saath-saath ankhon main shaayad geelaapan bhi laae
 Do you vote What do you care about? i vote and focus on the person, not the party
 kya wo padhaa likhaa he, kya samaaj seva karata he, in sabhi baton kaa khyaal rakhata hum
 You don't think doing the same side film
 'darty politics' ke baad 'jai ho demokrasi
 There was a serious issue in 'dirty politics', there was a story about corrupt leaders and here the political corridor is being talked about with fun
 to donon alag-alag kahaniyaan hai
 You have worked both in Bollywood and Hollywood, what is the difference? There is a lot of change in Bollywood, but we are still behind the story
 cinema kii aisi koun si vidhaaen abhi bachi hai jo aap karnaa chahenge?meraa pehla pyaar aisa cinema he jo saamaajik sachai se judaa ho, lekin hamaare paas kaam ke chunaav ke zyada vikalp nahin hote
 Then i just do whatever is useful
 lekin pehla pyaar hameshaa se saamaajik nishkarsh se judy filmein hi hai
 Do you remember the first day, when you faced the camera during the shoot? Yes, in 1975, a film from the Film Institute did 'chor Chor Chup Ja', in which i first encountered the camera
 bacchon ke saath kaam kiya tha
 What kind of songs do you like to listen to? i like the old songs more, which are the songs of the 50s and 60s which had sweetness, writing, literature
 sahir ludhiaanvi, majaruuh, shailendra, niraj ke geet dil ko choote the or kahani kaa hissaa hote the
 Today's songs are imposed, there is noise and nothing else
 khel koun-koun se pasand hai ?mujhe saare khel pasand hai, lekin mujhe aitraaj to nahin par badi takalif hoti he ki hamaare yahaan cricketrs ko khuda bana rakhaa he
 The rest of the sports like football, volleyball, basketball, hockey are not being given any place or consideration
 cricketrs arab or kharbapati ban rahe hai or baaki khelon ke khilaadi jab khelkar vaapis aate hai to unhen auto or taxi main ghar janaa padataa he
 This is very unfortunate
 hockey hamaare yahaan paidaa hui he or maaf karnaa, lekin jitani urja or stamina hockey or footbal main lagati he, utani kisi or khel main nahin lagati

 Sitting in his hotel room, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, looking fingers at the video game controller in an unruly manner, was looking at the Sydney Harbor Bridge
 unka dhyaan asal main shahar ko gher rahe kaale badalon par tha, jo dhire-dhire tufaan main badal rahe the or peeche tej bijli kii chamak chhod ja rahe the
 Such changes in the weather are not new to Dhoni
 kaale badal or peeche kadakadaati bijli—yani tamaam aarope, dhoni sab kuch jhel chuke hai
 Suddenly four years ago, the last ball at the Wankhede Stadium flashed that memorable six in his mind and soon after that a blurred picture of the Sydney Cricket Ground was revealed where his team was to play the semi-final of the 2015 World Cup against Australia two days later
 us vyakti kii niyati main kya likhaa tha jiskaa jaadui sparsh kahin kho gaya tha or aakhir tak aate-aate is sabase bade toornament main vah laut aayaa tha?aaj neeli tii-shart pehle prashasankon ke hujum ke saamne bhi paravaan chadhati gharelu team ke haathon harkar team india toornament se baahar he
 In such a situation it will be very easy to write Dhoni's memoir article
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki bharat ke van-de captain jis tarah australia main 85 din main gharelu team ke khilaaf kisi bhi formet main ek bhi match na jeet paane ke sadame se team ko nikaalkar vishwa cap main ajey record ke saath semifinal main le gaye—vah sansanikhej tha, bhale hi vah antim mukaam par maat kha baithe
 It is possible that this should be his last World Cup and only a few matches remain as India's indomitable captain, but it is true that Dhoni has left an indelible mark on India's one-day game and has set such a standard
 Based on which the past and future captains will be evaluated
 to bhala dhoni ne maidan kii paraajayon or apni ipiel team chennai superkings ko lekar sattebaaji or match-phixing ke sambandh main mudgal kamishan kii tikhi report kii vajah se upji pareshaaniyon se paar paakar kaise apni chamak phir se hasil kii? kya vaapasi kii yah gaatha kisi jaadui kalam se likhi gai thi yaa yah behad hoshiyaari se rachi gai koi yojana thi?bhartiya cricket team se jude sutara vishwa cap kii shuruyaat se mahaj das din pehle unki beti jeeva ke paidaa hone ko dhoni or bhartiya team ke punarutthan kii kahani kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu maanate hai
 That morning, his comrades hoped that Captain Dhoni would tell him that he would go home quickly and return his daughter with his arms in his arms
 isaki bajaae, dhoni aae or kaha ki ve australia main ruke rahenge or team ko sankat se baahar nikaalane kii ranneeti banane main yogadan karenge
 The strong leader was standing again and suddenly the target was cleared in front of everyone
 dressing room ke andar ke shaks ne bataaya, "ham sab jaanate the ki vishwa cap shuru hua to nattejey isse bure or kya honge
 But still the team was hesitant, uncertain; Fear was absorbed inside
 lekin jab captain mahendra singh dhoni ne tay kiya ki unki sabase badi nijee khushi bhi vishwa cap main puri jaan laga dene kii unki raah main roda nahin ban sakati, to use baad sthiti ekaek sanbhaalane lagi
 Everything changed that day
 "bhartiya cricket ke halaat sudharne kii ruparekha chaar test maichon kii siries ke ant main shakl lene lagi thi jisamen bharat 2-0 se haar gaya tha
 Although the results in the tri-series against Australia and England were worse, but Dhoni did not lose heart
 coach dancan kralechar ne form main maujuud viraat kohli or ajinkya rahane samet zyaadaatar ballebaajon ke stans par kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Now they stand with their feet spread out on the pitches and place the bat right in the middle of both feet for better balance
 ab ve us paaramparik pojishan se koson dur hai, jisamen balle ko daaen paanv ke peeche rakhaa jaataa tha
 The team director, Ravi Shastri, who has never hesitated to put his face to the fore, has taken advantage of his understanding with the team's bowling coach Bharat Arun, who has played under-19 and one-two Tests along with Test and one-day
 Started working on the weaknesses of Indian fast bowlers revealed in matches
 in sab takneekee dikkaton ko sudhaarney kaa kaam to dhoni ne unki jagah chhod diya
 But the task of removing the inertia started when the captain failed to reach the final of the tri-series and the captain took his fast bowlers to a boot camp 200 km from Adelaide
 vahaan unhone gendbaajon se vishwa cap se pehle apane-apane liye nae lakshya tay karne ko kaha
 After many brainstorming exercises, the conclusion was that the fast bowlers were either throwing too short or too full
 agle kuch dinon main unhone teen-chauthai length par gend patakane par dhyaan kendrit kiya—pehle madhyam tej gati se phir dhime-dhime gati badhaakar, jab tak ki ve sabhi aasaani ke saath 140 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se zyada kii genden na phenkane lage
 After that Dhoni started working with him on the strengths and weaknesses of the opposing batsmen
 har team main se kuch ballebaajon ko chunaa gaya jinhen achaanak short pich genden daalkar chaunkaae jane ke sambhavit lakshyon ke rup main rakhaa gaya
 Meanwhile, the captain asked Ravichandran Ashwin to try to throw a slow ball in the air and Shastri's experience as a spinner came in handy
 shastri phir asina ko purv australian of-spinner bruce yardley ke paas lekar gaye jinhone suzav diya ki asina ko in sthitiyon main zyada kaamyaab hone ke liye gend ko zyada ghumana chahie
 The results soon began to emerge — first on the nets and then in the opening matches of the World Cup
 teen mukhya tej gendbaajon, mohammad shami, umesh yadav or mohit sharma ne milakar toornament main 48 wicket liye
 Considering how high-scoring the tournament matches have been, Ashwin scored 4
 28 ran prati over kii khaasi kifayati dar se 13 wicket jhatakane main kamyaabi pai
 Former England captain Michael Vaughan said in Sydney, "I never expected that the Indian team would change positions so quickly and with so much success
" dhoni ek behad chaalaak captain hai or isisi toornamenton main apane khiladinnon par maano jaadu pher dete hai
 They are like Harry Potter
 "won ke purv saathi kevin petersan kaa kahana he ki team india main aayaa zyaadaatar badlaav dhoni kii vajah se he
 Pietersen, who is present as a commentator in Australia, told India Today, "they believe in waiting for a fatal strike
 unhone paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ko khilaakar sahi kiya or unke paas kisi bhi sthiti main unako bulaakar gendbaaji karne ke liye kehane kaa vishwaas tha
 "sourav Ganguly, considered a clever and successful captain of India, whose legacy of never giving up is perhaps inherited by Dhoni, considers Dhoni a better captain than himself
 ganguli kehete hai, "test maichon main unamem rangath najar nahin aati lekin simit overon ke khel main ve kamaal ke hai
 Continuing to play against Australia, even if they lost, gave them strength
 dhoni samajhadaar the kyonki unhone team ko ekajute rakhaa or sunishchit kiya ki ve haar se sabak seekhen
 His resignation from Test captaincy gave him new energy in the World Cup
 "haalanki halaat itane aasaan nahin rahe hai
 Mudgal commission report led by former BCCI head N
 shrinivasana ko hataae jane ke baad dhoni bilkul maano khol main chale gaye the
 Dhoni is also believed to be one of the 'anonymous persons' mentioned in the report
 shrinivasana ke saath unke sambandh gahare hai—ipiel ke jariye or india cements ke jariye bhi jisamen dhoni vaais-president hai
 Therefore, it is believed that the notion that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has also benefited from this relationship is not completely baseless and there are still many questions that have to be answered by Dhoni so that the shadow of the issue can be removed
 is dabaav main unhone na sirf daure par maujuud bhartiya media se khud ko kaat liya balki aisa lagata he ki unhone bhartiya team ke maamalon main unki dilchaspee lene kaa bhi virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 As the World Cup approached, it was clear that his performance in Test cricket was going down
 is baat ko mahasoos karte hue ki chayankarta or tejatarraar ravi shastri ke adheen team prabandhan ek nai taazgi kii jarurat mahasoos kar rahaa tha jo ab unke liye de paanaa mushkil tha, captain dhoni ne siries haar jane ke baad sidney test se pehle hi achaanak test cricket se sanyas le liya
 It was speculated that in this situation, with Virat Kohli becoming the quick captain, the journey ahead for Dhoni will be stopped
 lekin sambhawatah vishwa cap shuru hone ke baad team ko in donon ke bich kii aapasi samaj kaa hi phayda mila
 People inside described them as fierce opponents of each other but Kohli and Dhoni supported each other during this tournament and changed the situation
 ve sadakon par saath-saath ghoomte dikhe, saath-saath khaanaa khaane jate, or yahaan tak ki 6 march ko perth main west indies ke khilaaf match se pehle video game consol kharidte najar aae
 Despite becoming the Test captain, Kohli put his full force behind Dhoni as the undisputed leader for the tournament and the two stood together whenever needed
 ek captain, ek khilaadi or ek vyakti ke rup main dhoni hameshaa ek paheli rahe hai
 Towards the latter part of his career, he was clearly disinterested in Test cricket and the Indian team went on to lose overseas series one after another under his leadership
 lekin ekadivasiy cricket main or vah bhi khaas taur par isisi toornamenton main trophy jeetne ke prati unki lalak unhen jununee banaati ai he
 Although he never let his heart be seen in his face, India won the Champions Trophy in 2013 and played the final of the 2014 T20 World Cup
 haalanki yakeenan dhoni ke jivan kaa sabase khubasurat pal 2011 main vankhede main vishwa cap ke final kii raat thi
 Former England captain Nasir Hussain says, "they are the players of big matches
 unhone yah kaam bakhubi kiya he ki jab sabase zyada jaruri ho, team kaa dhyaan bantane nahin diya he
 "even in the World Cup-2015, Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the team to the very close despite many adversities
 lekin kai baar kuch chijen nahin hi honi hoti hai, phir bhale hi vah jaadui sparsh vaala vyakti hi kyon na ho

 This was a mandatory condition for contesting elections, but he obtained a fake degree from Bahauddin Zakaria University, Multan

 vakil ne kaha ki praasangik niyamon ke tahat ummidavaar ko do saal main snaatak pariksha uteern kerani thi, iskaa matlab he ki unhone varsh 2008 main farji degree banavaai thi
 He said, "although the condition of graduation was not applicable in the general elections of 2013, he gave false information in the 2008 elections, he was not virtuous and meritorious and as per Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution, this qualification was determined to be an MLA

 The incident is from Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh
 darasal is gang ne ek car churaai
 The car owner's mobile phone was kept in it, from which he connected the phone to his girlfriend

 Ghaziabad SP City Shiv Hari Meena said, 'A member of this gang called his girlfriend from a mobile which was left in the car
 jisko police ne tres karke choron ko pakad liya he
 'the gang was so vicious that it used to steal cars from outside the house within minutes and the people present in the house did not even know about it
 ye gang chori kii kaaron or bikes ko malls ke aas-paas kii parking main khadi kar detaa tha taaki kisi ko shaq na ho
 After a few days, the vehicles were sold when the matter subsided
 gang ke badmaash apane saath tamanchey or chaaku bhi rakhte the jinhen police ne baraamad kar liya he
 Noida police have set up a gang of robbers, who used to book a taxi on the phone and later loot it and escape
 police ne luteron ke paas se luti hui do kaaren bhi baraamad kii he
 The police is interrogating the miscreants
 noida police ko lut kii badhati vaardaaton par lagaam kasne main badi kamyaabi mili he
 In fact, there has been a gang of policemen who used to book a vehicle through 'just Dial'
 jab gaadi inke paas aa jaati thi toluteronkaa yah giroh driver ko bandhak banaakar gaadi lootakar faraar ho jaataa tha
 Police have found out during interrogation that crooks used looted mobile phones to call on 'just Dial'
 bataate chalem ki just dial ek aisi suvidha he jo har kshetra se jude phone number or adress muhaiyaa karwaati he
 Police have also recovered two cars from these robbers
 police isgirohake teen anya sadasyon kii talash main juty hui he
 The police is also interrogating the robbers

 In the Indian Premier League i
e
 season 10 of the IPL, there is another big revelation about fixing
 is maamle ke mukhya aaropee maharashtra ke under-19 khilaadi nayan shah ne bataaya he ki vah sattebaajon maichon ke nattejey prabhavit karaata tha
 The hotel room number 1733 had become a special destination for this work
 isliye vah hotel ke cameraan number 1733 main shift hua tha
 The main accused of IPL betting racket was shifted to room number 1733 on the 17th floor of the Shahko Hotel
 khulaasa hua he ki yah ek aisa cameraa he, jo ipel maichon ke liye sattebaaji kaa adda ban gaya tha
 Aaj Tak team reached the room on the 17th floor of the hotel
 vahaan sutron se pataa chalaa ki 17veen manzil par bhartiya team kaa koi bhi khilaadi nahin tha
 Police has also confirmed this
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki ipel tiimon ke kuch prabandhan se jude karmchaaree 17veen manzil par deraa daale rahete the
 Nayan Shah's movement is also captured in several CCTV cameras installed in the corridor there
 usee sisitivi footage ke aadhaar par police do logon kii talash kar rahi he
 One of which is considered to be a special ally of Nayan Shah, while the other one appears to be associated with a team with an I-card
 iske alaava police ne do logon sepuchhatachakarne kaa faisla liya he
 They are likely to be questioned soon
 lekin abhi tak police unke naam yaa pahchaan kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 Significantly, Nayan Shah was first allotted room number 1425 but was later shifted to room number 1733
 jaisaa ki amisha patel ko bhi shift kiya gaya tha
 Nayan Shah's cell phone records showed that he was in regular contact with bookie Bunty Khandelwal
 aise hi ek maukey par nayan ne do ipel khilaadiyon ko ek wais massej bhejkar unase sampark kiya tha
 Who were ready to help him in 7 to 8 matches

 Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde is upset with the Padma Bhushan award to NRI businessman Sant Singh Chatwal
 munde kaa aarope he ki jis kaa naam nau million dollar ke bank farjivade main uchhla, jiske khilaaf sibiai jaanch hui, us shaks ko itnaa bada sammaan diya janaa galat he
 Munde has also written a letter to the Prime Minister in this regard, in which he has asked Chatwal to withdraw this honor
 chatwaal ko bank farjivade maamle main mumbai police ne giraftaar kiya tha, lekin baad main unhen jamaanat mili, jiske baad wo desh chhodkar chale gaye the
 Narendra Modi was about 15 years old when India and Pakistan fought in 1965
 un dinon wo subah hi apni toli ke saath railway stesan pahunch jate or vahaan se hokar guzarane vaale sainikon kii seva main jute jate the
 Similarly, when there was a severe flood in Gujarat in 1967, Narendra Modi along with his colleagues jumped in to help and service the flood victims
 -band kar diya tha nakam or tel khanrees se judane ke baad narendra modi ne namak or tel khaanaa band kar diya tha
 This scared his mother and brother Prahlad Modi that Narendra Modi is not going to become a monk again
 narendra modi bachapan se hi aresas se jude hue the
 On the day of Diwali in 1958, the first RSS pracharak of Gujarat RSS, Laxman Rao Inamdar alias Vakil Saheb, administered the oath of child volunteer to Narendra Modi
 modi aresas kii shakhaon main jane lage
 But when Modi opened a tea shop, his visits to the branches decreased
 -prachaarkon ke liye chaay-naashtaa banaate the modinarendra modi kii jeevani likhane vaale lekhak emvi kamath ke mutabik gujarat aresas ke daftar headgavar bhawan main subah narendra modi prachaarkon ke liye chaay naashtaa banaate the
 After this Hedgewar used to clean all the rooms of the building
 aath nau kamaron kii safai ke baad apane or vakil sahab ke kapade dhone kii baari aati thi
 Modi was a hardworking worker Narendra Modi was a very hard working worker
 aresas ke bade shiviron ke aayojan main wo apane management kaa kamaal bhi dikhaate the
 RSS leaders had the responsibility of making reservations in train and bus
 itnaa hi nahin gujarat ke headgavar bhawan main aane vaali har chitthee ko kholane kaa kaam bhi narendra modi ko hi karnaa hota tha
 After seeing the management of Narendra Modi and the way he works, it was decided to give him a big responsibility in the RSS
 iske liye unhen rashtriya karyaalay nagpur main ek maheene ke vishesh training camp main bulaayaa gaya
 Narendra Modi returned as a Gujarat RSS pracharak by taking training at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur
 aresas ne narendra modi ko gujarat akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad kaa prabharee bana diya
 During the Emergency in 1975, Narendra Modi had the same role
 immergency ke dauraan narendra modi ne apane aaj ke sabase bade raajnneetik dushman shankar singh baghela ke saath milakar gujarat bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon main nayaa josh bharne kaa kaam kiya kiya or majboot kaaryakartaaon kii fouj taiyaar kii
 In those days, Shankar Singh Baghela was a beloved leader of the masses and Modi was known for his brilliant strategy
 -shuru se the thode manamanenarendra modi shuru se hi thode manamaane the
 His old colleagues say that Modi used to lie late for the morning branch of the Sangh due to sleeping late at night and when all the workers wore full sleeve kurta, Narendra Modi used to wear half sleeve kurta
 jab sabhi kaaryakarta khaaki nekar pahante to modi safed rang kaa nekar pahanakar aate the
 - Style was Judaarendra Modi's style was different from all campaigners
 wo dadhi rakhte the or trim bhi karavaate the
 Once the then president of the RSS, Madhavrao Golwalkar, in front of everyone asked Modi the reason for trimming the beard
 immergency ke dinon main modi ne gujarat main kai bhashaaon main lakhon kii taadaad main sangh kii vichaardhaara ko darshane vaale parche or poster chhapavaaye or puure desh main behad gupt tareeke se sangh ke daftaron tak pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 During the Emergency, Modi was given the responsibility of conducting a meeting of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 chande ke taur par ek badi rakam vahaan ikattha hui or tamaam vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon ko us rakam kii chintaa ho rahi thi
 At the same time, Modi dug a pit in the ground and suppressed all the money in it and lay down himself on his mattress
 somnath se ayodhya rath yatra main badi bhoomika90 ke dashak main narendra modi ne adwani kii somnath se ayodhya rath yatra main badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 He was then made the convenor of the then BJP President Murli Manohar Joshi's Ekta Yatra
 ye yatra dakshin main tamilnadu se shuru hokar srinagar main tirangaa laharaakar khatm honi thi
 
 
 
 jab mili anushaasan kii naseehatanarendra modi ke shandaar management main murali manohar joshi kii ekta yatra bahut kaamyaab hui, lekin ek din joshi narendra modi par bhadak gaye
 Actually it was decided that the national leaders and all the workers had to have food together
 lekin bangaloru main narendra modi anant kumaar ke saath gaayab ho gaye
 Joshi was very angry at this
 subah unhone kaaryakartaaon ke saamne modi ko kadi fatkaar lagaate hue anushaasan main rahane kii naseehat de daali
 Narendra Modi's ambitions started growing after Joshi's Ekta Yatra
 modi ko lagane laga ki unhen gujarat bijepi ke senior leaders keshubhai patel or shankar singh baghela kii haisiyat kaa samajha janaa chahie
 Modi's growing stature also started to shank Shankar Singh Baghela
 1995 main jab bijepi jitkar satta main ai to keshubhai patel ko party ne mukhyamantri banaaya
 Shankar Singh Baghela revolted in the party
 is saare fasaad kii jad mana gaya narendra modi ko
 The party then moved from Gujarat to Delhi, making Narendra Modi the national secretary
 dilli main modi 9 ashok road ke ek chote se kamare main rahete the
 Atalji wanted to make Modi the chief minister of Gujarat in 2001
 ek din us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne modi ko bulaayaa or bole- tum yahaan punjabi khaanaa kha khaakar mote hote ja rahe ho
 Now leave Delhi, go from here
 modi ne poocha kahaan- to atalji bole gujarat jaao or vahaan chunaav lado
 Modi bluntly said - i have been away from Gujarat for six years, away from all issues, how will this happen
 khayr thodi der baad unhen pataa chalaa ki atalji unhen gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banaakar bhejnaa chaahate the

 In Uttarakhand, BJP has urged the BJP not to give too much light to the two consecutive Chief Ministers Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri, who hold a figure of thirty-six in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, in two consecutive closed-door meetings during a week
 Speculation has intensified among the leaders of the ruling political party in the state
 bhaajapa ke sutron ne aaj yahaan bataaya ki khanduri or koshiyaari ke bich aisi koi baatcheet nahin hui he jiskaa koi rajnatik matlab nikaala jaye
 It is a courtesy call on the two leaders and the two leaders have held talks with each other
 haalanki baatcheet kaa mudda media ko jaahir nahin kiya gaya
 On the other hand Koshiyari told that he had met Khanduri yesterday and it was just a courtesy call
 unhone kaha ‘‘chunki khanduri gat ravivaar ko mujhase milane aaye the isaliye maine unase milanaa munasib samajha
 When Koshiyari was asked whether this meeting had any political meaning and whether there was any discussion on the functioning of the state Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Koshiyari said that Nishank is doing a very good job and very well Running the government in a manner
 koshiyaari se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya nishank ke kaamkaaj par rajya main koi nayaa sameekaran ban rahaa he to unhone kaha ‘‘is tarah kii baaten kahaan se aati hai
 Nishank is doing a very good job and is also running the government well
 nishank ke liye koi bhi khatra nahin he
 On the other hand, Khanduri said that he does not discuss the topics of such meetings with the press
 unhone kaha ki baithak main kya baatcheet hui, is par press ke saath charchaa nahin kii ja sakati he
 Due to constant opposition and pressure from Koshiyari last year in the state, Khanduri had to leave the chief minister's post when the BJP lost all five seats in the Lok Sabha general elections
 rajnatik galiyaaron main koshiyaari or khanduri kii mulaakaat ko varsh 2012 main vidhansabha ke liye hone vaale aam chunaavon main party dwaara majbootee se utarane kii taiyaari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 They themselves do not know how the invoice was received
 bade hue chaalaan ko lekar trek maalik kaa kahana he ki chaalaan ke rup main itani badi rakam ko vasuulana unke saath jyaadati he
 The public's attitude towards traffic rules on the roads has often been indifferent
 ab tak trephic chaalaan main chukaai jane vaali rakam bhi behad kam rahi thi

 lekin 2 lakh jaisi badi rakam kaa chaalaan kisi bhi vyakti ke liye bharna kabhi aasaan nahin hota
 Invoices: After the implementation of the new Motor Vehicle Act from September, invoices of huge amount are being deducted continuously

 Farooq said in response to this, i would have liked to be an actor, but now i have to wait for the next life
 stage par ranvir ne jab apni film 'bajirao mastaani' ke gane par thirakna shuru kiya to faruk abdulla bhi peeche nahin rahe or vah bhi ranvir ke saath thirakane lage
 Interestingly, 78-year-old Farooq Abdullah left no stone unturned to compete with 30-year-old Ranveer in a dance match
 stage par ranvir ne kaha ki agar faruk abdulla kariyar badal lete hai, to bollywood ke bade sitaron bhi pareshaan ho sakate hai
 Ranveer said, i think if you start acting then Mr

 modi sarkaar ke maujuuda bajet ko gramin garibon or khaskar kisaanon ke liye kaaphi hitaishi bataaya ja rahaa he
 But experts believe that despite measures like increasing the MSP of crops, easing of loans, the agrarian crisis does not seem to be going away at least in recent years
 bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri arun jetali ne daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar kisaanon ke kalyaan ke liye patibaddh he
 The Finance Minister has announced to fix 50 percent more than the MSP yield cost for kharif crops, along with the introduction of 'operation Green' in the agriculture sector
 lekin yadi tathyon kii jaanch karen or kuch din pehle hi jarieconomic sarvese tulanaatmak adhyayan kar len to lagegaa ki yah sab baaten mahaj kagaji hi hai
 Not much increase in budgetary allocation The budgetary allocation of agriculture has been made at Rs 46,700 crore, which is slightly more than last year's budget and only 2 of the total budget of Rs 21 lakh crore
 3 fisadi he
 It has been increased by only Rs 4,845 crore as compared to the previous budget
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki mahaj itani badhotaree main saal 2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguna karne kaa lakshya kya puraa kar paaegi sarkaar?i am surprised to hear this
 Farmers did not get 50% profit over cost of production in the rabi season
 In fact the MSP for several crops was in reality less than the production cost
 - Devinder Sharma (@devinder_sharma) February 1, 2018 Chhawalakhif of MSP sounds very attractive to hear 50% more than the cost in MSP for the crop, but the truth is that there is a problem with it
 isamen kahin yah saaf nahin kiya gaya he ki yah badhat utpaadan laagat se upar hogi yaa nahin
 The cost of production means that all the labor, family capital, land rent, etc
 should be included in it
 kisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki, 'bazaar hastkshep or keemat samarthan yojana ke liye aavanton pichley saal ke bajet ke sanshodhit anumaan 950 karod rupee se paanch guna ghataakar mahaj 200 karod rupee kar diya gaya he
 'former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has described it as mere showmanship
 unhone kaha, 'emspi ko 1
 It has been promised to increase 5 times, but no details have been given
 iske alaava, i-markets ke liye 2,000 karod rupee or oparation green ke liye 500 karod rupee kii rakam bhi maamuli hi he
 Nowhere does this indicate that the real income of the farmers will increase
 unhone kaha, 'krishi kshetra kii samasya jari rahegi or gahraaegi hi, isse kheti par nirbhar bahusankhyak logon ke jivan main durdasha bani rahegi
 'FM is using sleight of hand in talking about "cost of production"
 Instead of promising 50% 'net returns' over 'C2 cost', as recommended by Swaminathan Commission, he is talking about 'gross returns' over 'A2+FL costs'
 - Yogendra Yadav (@_yogendrayadav) February 1, 2018 Not much use of loans There has been talk of increasing the institutional credit disbursement for agriculture sector to Rs 11 lakh crore, but the truth is that most farmers are outside the scope of this loan system 
 iconomic survey ke anusaar is vitt varsh main pradhanmantri krishisinchai yojanapar mahaj 600 karod rupee kaa aavanton hua, jabaki rajyon main sookhe or manusan kii anischitata ke halaat dekhe gaye
 Due to this, the farmers were very angry and in many states, including Rajasthan, farmers protested
 kisaan sanghathanon ke anusaar, 'bajet main bhoomihin jotdar kisaanon ke kalyaan kii baat kahi gai he, lekin sach yah he ki pichley kuch varshon se bhoomihin kisaan credit skim lagu karne ke baavjood unki haalat main koi antar nahin aayaa he
 Most of the farmers who committed suicide in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha etc
 have remained landless
 bajet main jotdar kisaanon ke hiton ke liye vastav main kuch kiya bhi nahin gaya he
 'there is no special benefit of crop insurance too
 In Budget 2018, a provision of Rs 4,000 crore has been made for the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme
 lekin pichley aankadon se pataa chalata he ki isamen janata kaa paisa sirf barbaad hi ho rahaa he or vastav main kisaanon kaa zyada bhala nahin ho rahaa
 Private insurance companies are getting maximum benefit of this
 apad raahat aavanton main kamiiconomic survey main jalwaayu parirvatan or aapadaa ko kheti-kisaani ke liye mahatvapurn bataaya gaya tha
 But the Finance Minister has reduced the allocation for disaster relief
 survey ke anusaar jalwaayu parivartan se kheti kii aay main 20 fisadi kii giravat aa sakati he
 Even then, most of the growth will go to fertilizer and chemicals subsidies

 Since he is a yogi, i trust him

 But this was not possible due to the mutilated body

 The brother of BSF jawan Prem Sagar, who was martyred in the village, said that my brother has been martyred, we are proud of this
 unke bhai ne kaha ki main pradhanmantri narendra modi se apil karnaa chaahunga, ki jaise pakistan hamaare javaanon ke saath karata he vaise hi ham bhi unke saath karen
 Talk to his wife before he was martyred Prem Sagar, 50, a resident of Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, spoke to his wife on the phone on Monday morning, and asked about Premasagar's health and blood pressure
 lekin der raat pataa chalaa ki vah shahid ho gayi hai

 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid may be the finest modern batsman of this generation, but that does not stop him from praising unconventional and effective batsman Virender Sehwag

 The way he opened the opener has redefined it in many ways, at least for me

 On the occasion of Teacher's Day, Modi addressed children across the country through video conferencing and while answering their questions, said, 'climate has not changed

 Because of this we have spoiled our entire environment

 Basic Education Department of Uttar Pradesh is not ready to learn from its mistakes
 do maheene pehle farvari main vibhaag main shikshakon ke liye hue online aavedan main tamaam logon ne osama bin laden, baraak obama jaise galat naamon se registration karaayaa tha or inamen aankade bhi farji dhang se bhare the
 The interesting thing was that the department gave these fake names a top position in the merit in the list released for the interview without scrutinizing these documents
 yahi kahani ek baar phir doharaai gai he
 This time also this feat has been done in the Basic Education Department
 vibhaag ne march maheene main ucch praathmik vidyalayon main arts or physical ajukeshan padhaane ke liye 480 instractor kii tainaati ke liye online aavedan mangaaye the
 Based on these applications last week, the merit list released by the department for the interview showed a fierce breakup in Basti district
 basti jile kii suchi main dasharath ke putr ramchandra ko home science vishay main instractor pad ke liye aavedan karne waalon kii merit list main pehali pojishan mili he
 According to the merit list, Ramachandra is a general category applicant and also disabled
 unhen hiskool main 600 main 599 evam inter main 500 main 499 number mili hai
 His birth date is 1 July 1979
 duusari ore computer ajukeshan ke liye select hue abhyarthiyon kii list main pehle number par akhilesh yadav putr mulaayam yadav hai
 According to the list, Akhilesh belongs to the backward class disabled quota
 unke hiskool main 599 or inter main 499 number hai
 An official of the district school inspector office of Basti says that these names have been found to be fake only during preliminary investigation
 adhikari ke mutabik chunki online aavednon kii scrootni rajdhani lakhanu sthit basic shiksha mukhyalay main hui thi, aise main in donon aavednon kii vistrut jaanch ke liye maamle ko mukhyalay bhej diya gaya he
 Manbharan Ram Rajbhar, Basic Education Officer of Basti district, says, 'the application process was online, so it is possible to make such a mistake
 merit list main darj naamon kaa dobaaraa veriphication karaayaa ja rahaa he
 ' sanyukt raashtra satr main hissaa lene america pahunche pakistan ke pradhanmantri shahid khaakaan abbasi ne bhartiya sena kii 'cold start doctrin se nipatane ke liye short range newclear hathiyaar viksit karne kaa khulaasa karke bahes ched di he
 Since his statement, discussions have started about the cold start doctrine of the Indian Army
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir cold start doctrin kya he, jisase parmaanu shakti sampann pakistan thar-thar kaanpata he?ek america think-tanks ke sawaal parapakistanke pradhanmantri ne bhartiya sena kii is ranneeti kaa zikr kiya or isse nipatane ke liye short range ke parmaanu hathiyaar viksit kiye jane kii baat kii, jo is baat ko darshata he ki pakistan ke andar isko lekar kitna khauf he
 India had developed Cold War Doctrine or Cold Start Doctrine to deal with the threat of a possible war from Pakistan
 iske tahat behad kam samay main yani 48 ghante main hi dushman desh ke kshetra ghuskar hamalaa karnaa or phir waapas apni pojishan lenaa he
 It also does not provide an opportunity to stabilize the enemy
 ise uksaave kii karrwai bhi nahin mana jaataa he
 It also aims to avoid nuclear war with Pakistan
 disambar 2001 main sansad main aatanki hamale ke baad se bharat ne oparation parakram laanch kiya, jiske tahat cold start doctrin ko badhaava diya gaya
 After this attack, it took about a month for the Indian Army to reach the Pakistan border, due to which Pakistan got ample time to prepare itself

 India has never publicly accepted the Cold War doctrine

 2

 3
 Factory: In terms of industry, Gujarat is a leading state in Chemicals, Petrochemical, Dairy, Drugs and Pharma, Cement and Ceramics, Gems & Jewelery, Textiles and Engineering
 pradesh main 800 badi factriyon ke saath 4 lakh 53 hajaar se adhik small or medium factriyaan he

 vahiin gujarat main sakshartaa ke aankade 78 fisadi se adhik he
 According to CSO data, the biggest challenge behind achieving this goal is the state of the school in the state

 6
 swasthya suvidha:swasthya suvidhaon ke naam par uttar pradesh or bihar kii haalat behad kharaab he

 Many Puranas have been said about the marriage of Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati
 ye us samay kaa sabase bhavy vivaah tha
 The story that is most prevalent about their marriage, we tell you the same
 
 
 devtaa, daanav, maanav sab pahunche the shaadi menkaha jaataa he ki is vivaah main devataaon ke alaava asur or maanav, bhoot-pret, gana aadi sabhi maujuud the
 The wedding was attended by the biggest and the smallest
 shiv ko pashupati kaha jaataa he isliye saare jaanavar, keede-makode or saare jeev unki shaadi main shaamil hone pahunche the
 Even ghosts and vampires became guests
 jab shiv or parvati kaa vivaah hone vaala tha, to ek badi sundar ghatana hui
 They were getting married on a very grand scale
 isse pehle aisi shaadi kabhi nahin hui thi
 Shiva, the fiercest creature in the world, was about to become another part of his life
 unki shaadi main bade se bade or chote se chote log shaamil hue
 All the gods were present there as well as the Asuras also reached there
 aam taur par jahaan devtaa jate the, vahaan asur jane se manaa kar dete the or jahaan asur jate the, vahaan devtaa nahin jate the
 They did not get along at all
 magar yah to shiv kaa vivaah tha, isliye unhone apane saare jhagade bhulaakar ek baar ek saath aane kaa man banaaya
 Shiva is Pashupati, meaning he is also the God of all creatures, so all the animals, insects and pests and all the creatures attended his wedding
 yahaan tak ki bhoot-pishaach or veikshipt log bhi unke vivaah main mehmaan ban kar pahunche
 It was a royal wedding, a princess was getting married, so an important ceremony had to take place before the wedding ceremony
 bhagwaan shiv or devi parvati kii vanshavali ke bakhaan kii rasmvar-vadhoo donon kii vanshavali ghoshit kii jaani thi
 For a king, his lineage is the most important thing which is the pride of his life
 to parvati kii vanshavali kaa bakhaan khub dhoomdhaam se kiya gaya
 This went on for a while
 aakhirkaar jab unhone apane vansh ke gaurav kaa bakhaan khatm kiya, to ve us ore mude, jidhar var shiv baithe hue the
 All the guests started waiting that someone from the groom would rise and speak about the glory of Shiva's clan but no one said a word
 vadhoo kaa parivaar tajjub karne laga, 'kya uske khandaan main koi aisa nahin he jo khadey hokar uske vansh kii mahanata ke bare main bataa sake?' magar vaaki koi nahin tha
 No one from the groom's parents, relatives or family came there because there was no one in his family
 vah sirf apane saathiyon, ganon ke saath aayaa tha jo vikrut jeevon kii tarah dikhte the
 They could not even speak human language and used to make strange sounds
 ve sabhi nashe main chur or vicitra avasthaaon main lag rahe the
 Lord Shiva wears Parvati's father Parvati Raj, requested Shiva, 'please tell me something about your dynasty
 ' shiv kahin shunya main dekhte hue chupchaap baithe rahe
 He was neither looking towards the bride, nor was there any enthusiasm in the marriage
 shiv kahin shunya main dekhte hue chupchaap baithe rahe
 He was neither looking towards the bride, nor was there any enthusiasm in the marriage
 vah bas apane ganon se ghire hue baithe rahe or shunya main ghoorte rahe
 People of the bride's side kept asking him this question again and again because no one would want to marry his daughter to a man whose clan is not known
 unhen jaldi thi kyonki shaadi ke liye shubh muhoort teji se niklaa ja rahaa tha
 But Shiva remained silent
 samaaj ke log, kuleen raja-maharaja or pandit bahut ghrinaa se shiv kii ore dekhne lage or turant fusfusaahat shuru ho gai, 'iskaa vansh kya he? yah bol kyon nahin rahaa he? ho saktaa he ki iskaa parivaar kisi nichi jati kaa ho or ise apane vansh ke bare main bataane main shame aa rahi ho
 Narada Muni tried to explain the gesture, and Narada Muni, who was present in that assembly, saw this spectacle and lifted his harp and kept pulling the same strings
 vah lagaataar ek hi dhun bajaate rahe – toing toing toing
 Irritated by this, Parvati's father Parvat Raj lost his temper, 'what the hell is this? We want to hear about the lineage of the groom but he is not saying anything
 kya main apni beti kii shaadi aise aadmi se kar duun? or aap yah khijhaane vaala shor kyon kar rahe hai? kya yah koi jawaab he? naarad ne jawaab diya, 'var ke mata-pita nahin hai
 'raja asked,' Do you want to say that he does not know about his parents? 'narada told everyone that God is Swayambhu' No, he has no parents
 inaki koi viraasat nahin he
 They have no gotra
 iske paas kuch nahin he
 They have nothing but their own
 ' puri sabha chakra gai
 Parvat Raj said, 'we know people who do not know about their father or mother
 aisi durbhagyapurna sthiti ho sakati he
 But everyone is born to someone
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki kisi kaa koi pita yaa maa hi na ho
 'narada replied,' because it is Swayambhu
 inhone khud kii rachana kii he
 He has neither father nor mother
 inkaa na koi vansh he, na parivaar
 They do not belong to any tradition nor do they have any state
 inkaa na to koi gotra he, or na koi nakshatra
 Neither a lucky star protects them
 yah in sab chizon se pare hai
 He is a yogi and has made the entire existence a part of himself
 inke liye sirf ek vansh he- dhwani
 Adi, when zero nature came into existence, the first thing to come into existence was - sound
 inaki pehali abhivyakti ek dhwani ke rup main he
 These first appeared as a sound
 uske pehle ye kuch nahin the
 That is why i am pulling this wire

 surya kaa kisi raashi main pravesh sankranti kehalaata he or jabasooryadhanu raashi main pravesh karte hai to isedhanusankranti kaha jaataa he
 Dhanurashi is the fiery sign of Jupiter and the Sun's entry into it produces special results
 bimaariyaan or rog badhate hai
 There is a lot of fickleness in the minds of people
 is samay jyotishiya kaarnon se shubh kaaryavarjitaho jate hai atah ise dhanu kharmaas bhi kehete hai
 This time Dhanu Kharmas is starting from 16 December
 is samay vivaah kyon varjit hota he?- kisi bhi vivaah kaa sabase bada uddeshy sukh or samruddhi kii prapti hoti he
 - Dhanu Rashi is considered to be the sign of prosperity
 - is samay surya dhanu raashi main chalaa jaataa he, jisko sukh samruddhi ke liye acha nahin mana jaataa
 If married at this time, neither emotional pleasure nor physical pleasure will be found
 is samay nayaa vyavsaay yaa nayaa kaary kyon armbh na karen?- dhanu kharmaas main nayaa vyavsaay armbh karnaa aarthik mushkilon ko janm detaa he, kyonki is samay bina chaahe kharche kaaphi bad sakate hai
 - Businesses started in this period stop in between
 - vyavsaay main kaaphi karj ho saktaa he or logon ke bich mendhanfans saktaa he
 Why is the construction of new houses and the purchase of property prohibited? - The purpose of building property is to consume the property happily
 - parantu agar is samay menmakanabanaaya jayega to uskaa sukh mil paanaa kaaphi kathin hoga
 - If such an effort is made, the work may stop due to interruptions
 - kabhi-kabhi durghatnaon kii sambhaavnaaen bhi ban jaati hai
 - The houses constructed during this period are generally weak and they do not get the pleasure of residence
 dhanu kharmaas main koun se kaary kar sakate hai?- agar prem vivaah yaa swayamvar kaa maamla ho to vivaah kiya ja saktaa he
 - Even if Jupiter is in the horoscope, auspicious works can be done during this period
 - jo kaary niyamit rup se ho rahe hon unako karne main bhi kharmaas kaa koi bandhan yaa dabaav nahin he
 - Karmanta, Jatakarma and Annaprashan etc
 can be done in this period due to the predetermination
 kinake upar surya ke is raashi parivartan kaa bura prabhaav hoga or kinake liye acha?- jinako krodh aata ho, raktchaap badha rahata ho, unke liye acha nahin hoga
 - People who have bone problems should pay special attention
 - jinaki raashi vrishabh,kark, kanya, tula yaa makar he, unhen samasyaayein pareshaan kar sakati hai
 Those who are in the field of administration or spirituality will benefit
 - jo log suryoday ke purv uthte hai, ve tamaam mushkilon se bache rahenge
 - This change will be beneficial for Aries, Leo, Scorpio, Sagittarius and Aquarius
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale se puraa desh stabdh he
 Countries from the United Nations to the United States, Russia and France have condemned the incident and have spoken of India's support in the fight against terrorism
 lekin aam taur par har maukey par bolne vaale, amano-amaan kii baat karne vaale pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne is hamale ko lekar chuppi saadh rakhi he
 The terror attack in Pulwama has occurred when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is to have a 5-day meeting in Paris from today (sunday)
 jisamen pakistan par bharat samet tamaam deshon ne aatanki funding ke saboot pesh kiye hai
 Therefore, it can be considered Imran's diplomatic silence before the FATF meeting
 videsh maamalon ke jaankaar or pakistan par najar rakhane vaale varisht patrkaar qamar aagaa ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha he ki pakistan is vakt aarthik sankat se jujh rahaa he
 In such a situation, tensions between indo-pak suits Islamabad
 kyonki isse focus kahin or shift ho jayega or pakistan yahi chahta he
 Qamar Aga said that Pakistan is already included in the fatf's gray list
 aise main paris main aaj hone vaali yah baithak or ahm ho jaati he jab america, europea sangh, france, germany samet tamaam deshon ne pakistan ko apni jameen se aatankwaad ko khatm karne kii baat kahi he
 The dossier of evidence is ready
 India has also become active in view of the FATF meeting
 pulavama hamale ke baad tamaam agenciyon pakistan ke khilaaf sabooton kaa dogier taiyaar kar videsh mantralay ko saunpane ko kah diya gaya he
 Earlier, the status of Most Favored Nation (MFN) given to Pakistan in the Cabinet Committee on Security Affairs has been withdrawn
 jisase paak se aayaat hone vaali kisi bhi vastu par ab 200 fisadi custom duty lagegi
 Under international pressure, it will be India's effort to isolate Pakistan already struggling on the economic front
 qamar aagaa kehete hai imran khan is baithak ke khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Because Islamabad had assigned a blue print to the FATF in the last meeting to stop the funding of terror
 masood ajahar kii karatuut padegi baribataa den ki efeetief kii pichhali baithak main pakistan ko grey-list main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 In this meeting, other countries of the world including India presented evidence of the use of the banking system by fund raising and terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed
 sanyukt raashtra ne in aatanki sanghathanon par pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 Pakistan is constantly trying to get out of this list
 lekin pulavama hamale kii jimmedaari jaish-e-mohammad dwaara liye jane ke baad paak kii raah efeetief main aasaan nahin rahane vaali
 This important meeting of the FATF could be the immediate reason for the silence of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan
 lekin iskaa doosraa bada kaaran imran kii party pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) ke khufia agency iesai or jaish se sambandh bhi ho sakate hai
 Please tell that Maulana Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, has the support of ISI of Pakistan's intelligence agency
 is baat kii pushti swayan bharat ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kar chuke hai ki 1999 ke qandahar vimaan hijank kii ghatana main iesai ne talibani aantkiyon kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Three terrorists, including Masood Azhar, were released in the incident
 aapako bataa den ki pichley saal pakistan main hue aam chunaav main imran khan kii party sabase bada dal banakar ubhari thi
 Questions were then raised by EU election observers that Pakistan's political climate before the election affected the results
 pakistan ke maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki chunaav kii vishwasniyata par sawaal khadey karne ke paryaapt aadhaar hai
 After all, to understand what these organizations were pointing, we have to look at those developments
 pathankot eiforce base hamale ke baad tatkaaleen pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne jaish kii bhoomika sweekaar karte hue masood ajahar samet anya aatankiyon ko giraftaar karne ke aadesh de die
 Imran had got Masood's support in the election but the Pakistani army ensured that Masood Azhar and his associates were not arrested, but kept in custody at a safe house of the ISI
 taaki naa to sharif sarkaar or naa hi bharat sarkaar masood ajahar ko haath laga paae
 On Sharif's move, Masood Azhar called him a 'traitor' and worse than Musharraf and Zardari
 panama papers main navaj sharif kaa naam aane ke baad pakistani sena ko nyaaypalika ke jariye unhen apdasth karne kaa mauka mil gaya
 While Azhar Masood openly campaigned in support of Imran Khan in Punjab province during the elections
 pakistan main hue aam chunaav par islamabad hai court ke jaj ajeeb siddiqui ne gambhir aarope lagaae the
 He had said that the intelligence agency ISI intervened in judicial matters and alleged that ISI had told the Chief Justice of the High Court that Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam should not come out of the jail till the elections were over
 pakistan kii satta par kabiz hone ke baad imran khan ne mahaj bayanon main bharat se baatcheet kii vakaalat kii, or duusari taraf sena va iesai kii shah par masood ajahar ko apane sanghathan kaa vistaar karne kii khuli chhot milti rahi
 Obviously, due to the army and ISI, Imran Khan has got a chair, his hands will remain tied with Masood Azhar
 kyonki pakistani sena or iesai bharat ke khilaaf jo proxi waar lard rahe hai masood ajahar us bisaat kaa sabase bada mohara bhi he or donon kaa laadla bhi

 ''there is a video clip doing the circles claiming that@javedakhtarjadudancing with@urmilamatondkarand me is from Ambani celebrations in Udaipur Fact is it is at our house Sukoon in Khandala at Shahana Chinmayas wedding— Azmi Shabana (@azmishabana)december 10, 2018 Akshay, in a review petition, has asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the death sentence
 doshi ne supreme court se punarvichaar yachika daakhil karne main hui deree ke liye bhi maafee kii baat kahi he
 In the petition, Akshay has appealed that air pollution in delhi-ncr is at a dangerous level
 dilli gas chember main tabdeel ho chuki he
 Also, the water here has become poisonous
 aise main jab kharaab hawa or pani ke chalate umr pehle se hi kam se kam hoti ja rahi he phir faansee kii sajaa kii jarurat kyon he?bataa den ki 9 july 2018 ko supreme court nenirbhaya gangrape maamle main teen doshiyon kii punarvichaar yachika khaarij kar di thi
 Akshay, the fourth accused, had not yet filed a review petition
 court ne kaha tha ki saare material par gaur karne ke baad ham pate hai ki punarvichaar karne kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 There is no merit in the petition
 supreme court ne vinay, mukesh or pawan kii punarvichaar yachika par faisla sunaaya tha
 Earlier, the court had reserved its verdict by ending the hearing on 4 May 2018
 5 may 2017 ko apane faisle main supreme court ne chaaron doshiyon kii faansee kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Congress leader and party spokesperson Sandeep Dixit said on Monday that we want Rahul Gandhi to have a greater responsibility in the government, but he himself wants to work for NSUI and Youth Congress
 gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko cabinet main hue pherbadal main rahul gandhi ko koi badi bhoomika nahin di gai
 But there are also reports that Rahul Gandhi may soon be seen in a 'big' role in the organizational reshuffle in the Congress
 pherbadal isi hafte hone kii sambhaavna he
 When Rahul did not get a big responsibility in the cabinet, Manmohan Singh had revealed that he wanted to include Rahul Gandhi in the cabinet, but Rahul wants to work for the party
 rahul ne pichley saptaah raashtrapati pranab mukherjee se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 This intensified speculation of Rahul's role

 At a rally near Aligarh on Saturday, Ajit Singh described the Mayawati government as the most corrupt government ever
 ajit singh ne kaha ki janata ab bhrashtachar se pareshaan ho chuki he
 So the time has come when Mayawati government should be overthrown
 air india kii sevaaon ke bare main ek se badhkar ek khabaren aati rahi hai, lekin is baar ek behad dilachasp khabar ai he
 One flight of Air India was late for about five hours due to the fact that the pilot went to the temple to worship Lord Shiva and got caught in the crowd
 mumbai ke ek akhbaar ne yah khabar dete hue bataaya ki dilli se mumbai kii air india udaan AI887 mangalvaar ko teen ghante let ho gai
 That is also because the pilot went to worship on Shivaratri
 akhbaar ne yatriyon kaa hawala dete hue likhaa he ki udaan kaa samay 9 baje kaa tha, lekin uske bare main koi soochna nahin hone ke kaaran yatri baithe rah gaye
 After the announcement, the passengers boarded the aircraft somehow
 9:45 tak puraa vimaan bhar gaya, lekin vah uda hi nahin
 After much delay, the passengers inquired, they were not told anything
 lekin ek yatri ne bataaya ki cabin main koi payalat nahin tha
 According to the information, at 11:40 am the pilot boarded the plane and after that he stood on the runway
 baad main vah 1:45 baje vimaan ne udaan bhari
 That is, a quarter to five hours late
 baad main pataa chalaa ki ek payalat mandir main mahashivaratri kii puja ke liye mandir gaya tha, jahaan use vilamb ho gaya
 According to Air India rules, there is a provision to impose penalty on delayed pilots
 har ghante ke vilamb par unhen 500 rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 With this rule, both pilots will be fined a total of Rs 18,000
 lekin hameshaa kii tarah air india ne is maamle par bhi chuppi saadhe rakhi he
 Siddharth Dey has been eliminated in the show Bigg Boss surprise mid-week Edition
 darshakon se sabase kam vot milane kii vajah se siddharth de kaa safar sho main khatm ho gaya he
 Speaking to the media after leaving the show, Siddharth Dey not only told about the wounds on his body in the show but also showed his wounds to the audience
 bataa den ki siddharth de ko pichley nomination task main kaaphi torchar kiya gaya tha
 Aarti Singh and Shahnaz Gill put bleed, red chili powder and even laundry surf on Siddharth's body
 in sab torchar kii vajah se siddharth de kii body par kai jakhm pahunche the or abhi bhi unka treetment chal rahaa he
 In an interview to the media, Siddharth Dey showed his wounds and also showed burn marks on his neck
 is bare main puche jane par siddharth ne kaha- apane sharir par pahuchen is jakhm ko thik karne ke liye unhen dinabhar main 20 goliyaan khaani pad rahi hai
 Why are the fans raging on Salman Kham? People are trolling Salsan Khan and the makers of the show on social media after seeing the wound on Siddharth Dey's body
 yugers salmaan khan or big bos ke mekars par aarope laga rahe hai ki unhone siddharth de ke ghaav ko dikhaane ke bajaae aarti singh or shahanaz gil ko saport kiya
 Users also said that despite all this, the makers did not take any action against Aarti and Shehnaaz, but supported them by saying that they were right
 aaie aapako bataate hai soshal media yugers kya kah rahe hai?though i am a # asimriazsupporter! # sidharthdeygot the worst burn out of d hand holding task!this is clearly inhuman & downright unacceptableno one deserve this kind of torture, i wonder how he didn't raise his voice against this # artisingh& # shehnaazgillshould apologize!pic

 com / qlgu9axjrf — Follow Krutika BB13 ♥ ️💁🏻♀️ (@realkrutika) October 30, 2019 abhi kya karensaamaajik maamalon ke mantralayon main sabase betahar mantriyon kii niyukti ho
 Not a rhetorical thinker, not even rash people, not even to show kindness to his party members, friends and family
 party ke vafaadaar tattu nahin, kisi khaas nirvachan kshetra ke prati dikhaave ke liye hi sahi, bich jane vaale nahin
 Of course, there is no one who cares too much about his comfort
 aise log jinamein yah jaanane-samajhane kii baudghik lalak ho ki ye samasyaayein kyon itani vikaraal ho jaati hai
 Why is it so modest even after spending so much money? People who try to learn with patience, who have the will to wage a continuous struggle against personal interests
 shikshak, jo padhaanaa nahin chaahate, kaam se nadaarad doctor, companiyaan, jo khushi-khushi nadiyon main jehar ghol rahi hai or ve sab, jo is desh ko lut rahe hai, sabake khilaaf ek satat sangharsh ho
 This is not at all easy
 hameshaa nai-nai yojanaayen shuru karne kii hadabadi jo hoti he
 Whenever possible, the new government is immediately stampeded
 lekin agar nae mantri ko sahi dhang se kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa to unhen ise karne ke liye vakt kii darkaar hogi
 Patience is very important
 100 din main kya karenshuru ke 100 din vahi soche-samajhe kaam karne kaa vakt he, baad main jinke, thode dinon ke liye hi sahi, alokapriy hone kaa andeshaa he
 It is quite clear that the worst aspect of the Right to Education Act will come to the surface again
 badi sankhya main garib tabake ke bacchon ko shiksha dene vaale saste nijee skulon par ajeeb kism kii nunatam jaruratein bataakar unka daman kiya ja rahaa he
 For example, what should be the salary of teachers, what should the school building look like
 sau din yah tay karne ke liye kaaphi nahin he ki is kanoon main kaise sudhaar kiya janaa chahie, lekin ise lagu karne se to roka hi ja saktaa he taaki skool chalate rahen
 Obviously, this will cause ruckus
 rajdhani main sarkari shikshakon kaa taqatvar kunba or unke saathi shor machayenge
 But the step which will make the situation more interesting is that the subsidy on petroleum products should be abolished
 bahut pehle se yah saaf ho chukaa he ki ye chijen hamaare paryaavaran ke liye buree hai or hamen peeche dhakelne vaali hai
 To make this decision a little more enjoyable, the government should also announce that 50% of the existing petroleum subsidy will be spent on universal cash transfer
 ek saal main kar daalencash transfar ke liye kisi lambii-chaudee vyavastha kii jarurat nahin he
 Giving everyone a UID or unique identity card will make it easier to ensure that no one can take advantage of it twice
 agar har kisi ke paas apana bank khaataa hoga to transfar karnaa aasaan ho jayega
