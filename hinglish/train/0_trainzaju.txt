 ashok gahalot ek-ek karke apane mantrimandal main shaamil hone vaale vidhayakon ke naam pukaar rahe the or unke bagal main mike rakhaa hua tha jis par vah shapath pard rahe the
 He was sitting on a chair next to Mike and signing his own

 Khachariwas went there and greeted him

 Earlier, none of the 11 cabinet ministers had even approached Sachin Pilot
 darasal, pratap singh akele ek aise vidhayak the jo khulkar sachin payalat ko mukhyamantri banane kii maang kar rahe the
 He was repeatedly arguing that the command should be in the hands of anyone who has worked hard for 5 years

 Recently, during the inspection of the police station in Bijnor district, the policemen got exposed
 naa wo hathiyaar chalaa paae or naa hi unke naam bataa paae
 But as soon as Yogi ji took over the command of Uttar Pradesh, the UP police had been put on Operation "thok Do"
 yogi ji ke aadesh par police dhadadhad aparaadhiyon ko thok bhi rahi thi
 Surprisingly, while performing the encounter neither the gunmen of the UP policemen nor the criminals were getting trapped
 baat pashchimi upi ke bijanour zile kii he
 Where Arjun Kumar, CO of Bijnor had reached Najibabad police station
 aane se kaaphi pehle hi unhone soochna bhi bhijwa di thi ki wo nirikshan karne aa rahe hai
 The inspection started with a inspector
 daroga ji ko pallate gan di gai or kaha chalie
 Hey, is this what you missed? sio saabah chilla uthe
 For a long time, the government has given this pellet to the gun station
 thane ke divaan sahab ne sambhaal kar bhi rakhi
 But na diwan means to sir
 naa inspector sahab se matlab
 Job is going on chalane dijie
 Thanedar drove, but what is that sir again saying Oh my God
 phir miss ho gai
 But now how to fire next
 goli kahaan lagegi
 Please tell someone
 sahab thanedaar se bole, ab bandook neeche karo
 Change the bullet vahaan khadey hokar ye sab dekh rahe dewan sahab kii to jaise izzat par ban ai
 He snatched the gun from the Thanedar and started aiming himself
 magar ye kya dewan ne goli to chalaai lekin phuss ho gai
 This news is old, but necessary to understand
 aisa ek baar nahin, baar-baar hua
 The gun did not fire when the opportunity came
 haalanki encounter ke liye bhi sarkari bandooken hi istemaal kii jaati hai
 On whose strength the UP Police conducted a rigorous encounter
 kai badmaash dher kar die
 Many people were injured and caught
 he naa kamaal? ek taraf upi kii sarkari bandooken chalati hi nahin thi, or ab achaanak vahi bandooken danaadan goliyaan ugal rahi thi
 Why not grow? When the finger on the trigger is of the Yogi's decree and the government orders the encounter, the bullets will run
 sawaal ye he ki achaanak upi main accounter kii jhadi kyon lag gai? kya whupi main kaanoon vyavastha is kadar charmara gai he ki encounter ke alaava koi rasta hi nahin bachaa? kya upi main criminal is kadar belgaum ho chuke hai ki achaanak puure sosayadi ke liye khatra ban gaye? kya upi kii police is kadar bebas ho gai ki krime par control hi nahin kar paa rahi he? yaa phir sarkaar ne sabase aasaan rasta chun liya he ki krime khatm karnaa he, to criminal ko hi khatm kar do
 But is this path right? Is the encounter the only way and the last weapon to improve up's law and order? If yes, then as long as this encounter continues, why not lock all the courts of UP for the time being? Anyway, justice is now happening on the street instead of the courts
 wo bhi goliyon se
 The use of the word Encounter began in the twentieth century in India and Pakistan
 encounter kaa sidhaa sidhaa matlab hota he badmaashon ke saath police kii muthbhed
 However, many people also call the encounter as a government killing
 hindustan main pehla encounter 11 janvari 1982 ko mumbai ke wadala college main hua tha, jab mumbai police kii ek special team ne gangster manya surave ko chah goliyaan maari thi
 It is said that after shooting the police, he put him in a car and roamed the streets of Mumbai till he died
 iske baad use aspataal le gai
 This first encounter of independent India was engulfed in controversies
 ye tamaam encounter isliye sawaal khadey karte hai ki inamen se har encounter ailaania kah kar kiya gaya
 According to the sources, the list of criminals declared to the UP STF and all the district police was sent and according to the same list, encounters are going on in UP
 vaise ise pataa nahin ittefaq kahenge yaa kuch or ki pehle khud yogi adityanath ko upi sarkaar or upi police se khud ke liye sangrakshan maangani padaa tha
 That too in Parliament
 tab unhone baqayada rote hue kaha tha ki upi sarkaar unhen jhuthe aapraadhik maamalon main fansaa rahi he
 But times have changed
 ab vahi yogi upi kii sarkaar ke sardaar hai or upi police unke aadhin
 Now someone else is asking for protection

 The police were stunned when it came to know that their number was running four hours before Sanju Bardoloi reached Bangalore, which was activated
 jis vendor ke jariye use pre actevatid sim mila tha, usase jab poochtacha hui to kareeb 1,000 pre actevatid sim card kaa pataa chalaa jo ki ek pratishthit mobile seva dene vaali company ke varisht adhikariyon kii sahmati se saat vendors ke jariye graahakon ko diya ja rahaa tha
 According to City Crime Branch DCP Abhishek Goyal, with the consent of some senior executives of the company, vendors would forge documents in the documents of customers with the correct documents and create fake documents and thus create thousands of new customers every month
 police kaa kahana he ki niyamon ko is tarah taak par rakhkar jari kiye ja rahe sim se na sirf aatankiyon par nazar rakhana mushkil ho jaataa he, balki duusare aapraadhik maamalon main bhi jaanch ke dauraan badi chunautiyaan khadi ho jaati hai
 The police suspect that other companies may also be involved in the work of increasing the market by issuing a pre-activated SIM in this way on the basis of fake documents and an investigation has been started

 Viagra or other drugs that increase sex power do not provide any special benefit to men and there is no change in their relationship with their partner
 is baat kaa khulaasa ek research se hua he
 Scientists conducted 40 clinical trials to know the changes in the life of men with Viagra
 shodh main shaamil pratibhaagiyon ne viagara lene se pehle bataaya ki partner ke saath unka rishta to thik he, lekin unhen sexual santushti nahin mil paati he
 Most of these men were also depressed
 lekin trial ke ant main shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki viagara lene ke baavjood bhi pratibhaagiyon kii sex life or saathi ke saath rishte main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Experts say that the physical problems are overcome by the medicine, but psychological obstacles remain
 uniwarsity of marilland medical centre ke doctor andrew craimar kehete hai, 'khushiyaan bahut jatil hai
 Most couples need sex therapy
 'research paper ke mutabik shaareerik kamajori yaa napunsakata kaa nakaaratmak prabhaav sex naa kar paane kii naakaami se kahin zyada purushon ko bhaavnaatmak or manovaigyanik rup se zyada pareshaan karata he
 In such a situation, the treatment which touches the physical and psychological aspects, is right for men
 haalanki 60 saal kii umr ke lagbhag 65 fisadi purush napunsakata ke shikaar ho jate hai
 And by the age of 40, 40% of men face this problem
 spire liverpool aspataal main sexual health visheshgy doctor arun ghosh kehete hai, 'inamen se zyaadaatar purush 40 ke hone or pet ke aasapaas charbi ke kaaran testasteron difishansi syndrome ke shikaar hone lagate hai, jisase testasteron level girane lagata he
 As a result, the desire for sex ends
 jab aap 40 ke ho jaaen or aapako aise lakshna dikhaai dene lagen to khun kii jaanch karana behatar he
 According to Dr
 Ghosh, there is also a psychological reason for the desire to lose sex
 unhone kaha, 'agar aapane ek baar bhi is pareshaani kaa saamana kiya hota he to aap hameshaa is baat ko lekar pareshaan rahete hai ki kahin aisa dobaaraa naa ho jaae
 Therefore, it is important that men are also treated psychologically and they should also be given sexual counseling or therapy

 Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Saturday asked Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to apologize for cheating the people of the state
 unhone parrikar se vidhayakon kii kharidari karke rajya main sarkaar gathan main unki madad karne ke liye kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ko dhanyavad dene ko kaha
 He said on Twitter, 'mr
 Parrikar should be ashamed for his power hunger
 aapane goa ke logon ke saath dhokhaa kiya he,unase maafee mangiye'
 Singh's statement comes at a time when Parrikar thanked him for the formation of a government in the state
 parrikar ne shuukravaar ko kaha tha ki vah singh ko dhanyavad dena chaahate hai jo goa main congress party ke maamalon ke prabharee hai kyonki vah goa main gum rahe the or main goa main sarkaar banane main safal rahaa
 Singh said that Parrikar should thank Nitin Gadkari instead of him who aggressively bought the mlas
 unhone kaha, manohar parrikar ne goa main unhen sarkaar gathit karne dene ke liye meraa dhanyavad kiya
 If he has to thank anyone, it is Nitin Gadkari who aggressively bought mlas from a Goa hotel on the morning of March 12
 unhone ek anya twit main kaha, samvidhan, chunaav ayog ke dishanirdesh evam ucchtam nyaayalay kaa ulanghan karne , or goa ke janadesh ko chhinane vaali goa kii rajyapal ko dhanyavad dena chahie
 Significantly, the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the recent assembly elections in Goa, but with the support of other parties, the BJP was successful in forming the government under Parrikar's leadership

 The battle cry of Lok Sabha elections has been done
 sabhi siyaasi dal or netaa apane-apane varchasv ko bachaane main lage hue hai
 In this battle of supremacy, veteran Congress leader and former Union Minister Jitin Prasad is angry with the party leadership
 mana ja rahaa he ki jitin prasad congress kaa saath chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 There is speculation that Prasad may be bjp's candidate from Dhaurahra seat
 lekin congress kaa sheersh netritv unhen manaane main juta hua he
 In this sequence, sources are quoted saying that Congress President Rahul Gandhi has met Jitin Prasad
 mulaakaat ke baad jitin ke saamne do vikalp hai
 The first option is to contest elections from Lucknow against Jitin Rajnath Singh and in the event of defeat, the Congress has given him the confidence to give him a seat in the Rajya Sabha
 naaraaz chal rahe jitin ke paas doosraa vikalp yah he ki ve dhauraharaa loksabhaa seat se chunaav laden
 So what did Jitin agree? Jitin Prasad does not want to contest from Dhaurahra
 unka kahana he ki unke aasapaas kii lakhimpur khiri or sitapur kii donon siton se congress muslim ummidavaar ladaa rahi he
 Prasad has come to know that the Mahagathbandhan will field a Muslim candidate in Dhaurahra, which will lead to a Hindu versus Muslim election in the area and he will be defeated for the second time
 isiilie jitin congress netritv par dabaav bana rahe the ki sitapur yaa lakhimpur khiri main se kisi bhi ek seat se muslim ummidavaar hataaya jaae
 Why is the Congress confused? According to the current situation, Jitin Prasad should either contest from Lucknow and later go to Rajya Sabha in the event of defeat, or contest from Dhaurahra
 kyonki congress ab donon main se kisi bhi muslim ummidavaaron ko badalakar puure rajya main galat sandesh nahin dena chaahati
 At the same time, the difficulty is that while Kaitar, a former MP from Sitapur, was made available by the Congress on the condition of giving the ticket to the party, the candidates of Lakhimpur Kheri won the second seat on the party ticket in 2009
 sutron kii maane to congress netritv kaa aisa maananaa he ki jitin prasad lakhanu se chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar ho jaaenge
 Let me tell you that the Dharaura seat first came into existence in 2009 and Jitin Prasad won this seat from the Congress ticket
 lekin saal 2014 main bijepi ke rekha verma se haar gaye the
 Jitin Prasad is the son of senior Congress leader Jitendra Prasad
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko mili prachand bahumat kaa asar pradesh main saaf najar aa rahaa he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Rahul Bhatnagar has issued a government decree
 jisamen sabko 20 march se daftar samay par aane kaa aadesh diya gaya he
 At the same time, strict action will be taken against the officers and employees who do not follow this order
 mukhya sachiv ne jari kiya aadeshupi kaa aglaa mukhyamantri koun hoga philhal is par suspence barkaraar he
 Nevertheless, it is clear from this news that whoever the chief minister is, the eye on him is directly related to Prime Minister Modi

 Now it comes that on the statement of Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sidhu had campaigned for Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli and said in a meeting on April 28 that if Rahul Gandhi loses to Amethi, he will quit politics
 siddhu us samay aatmavishvaas se labarej the or shaayad unhen ummid nahin thi ki unka yah bayaan ek maheene ke andar hi baari padane vaala he

 During the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was the star campaigner

 dilli ke uttam nagar main baari maatra main avaidh sharaab baraamad kii gai he, jise chunaav ke dauraan baanta janaa tha
 The charge is on the candidate of the Aam Aadmi Party and the politics on this issue has intensified

 com / xnu6mzuvin You must have seen a lot of your favorite heroes in the movies jumping from high erats and then easily getting rid of the enemies' sixes, but imagine what happens if an ordinary person jumps from the 8th floor? Of course, his escape is impossible, but something happened on the streets of Russia in the past that everyone's eyes were left open
 utyub par is durghatana ke video ko bhi khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 The video shows a man accidentally fall on a car parked in the parking lot from the 8th floor
 ghatana hote hi aasapaas ke log car ko gher lete hai
 The same thing is going on in everyone's mind that that man is no longer in this world, but then suddenly that man wakes up groaning and starts walking
 haalanki durghatana main vyakti ko khub chot aati he or sharir par kai jagahon se khun bhi nikal rahaa hota he
 But compared to the height from which he fell, it would be called less
 baad main poochtacha karne par us shaks ne bataaya ki vah sharaab ke nashe main tha or use nahin pataa yah sab kaise kya ho gaya
 Watch the video of the incident- ek sthaneey adaalat ne korporate jasusi maamle main giraftaar ek vyakti kii police hiraasat teen din ke liye badha di, vahiin dilli police ne kaha he ki is maamle main naukarshahon ke nijee sahaayakon (pie) or nijee sachivon sahit kuch or naam saamne aae hai jinaki jaanch kii jarurat he

 The agency said that they needed to interrogate Lokesh Sharma in front of two other accused in connection with the second FIR lodged in the espionage case

 mukhya metropolitan magistrate ne kaha ki yah maamla gambhir pravriti kaa he or ‘‘police hiraasat teen din or badhaane ke liye kiya gaya anurodh sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 The court also asked the Crime Branch to provide copies of the FIR and other documents to the accused
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘iskaa uddeshy yah he ki use pataa hona chahie ki uske khilaaf kya aarope lagaae gaye hai
 "with this, the court asked the police to decide by March 3 whether the matter comes under the Official Confidential Act or not
 lokesh kii ore se pesh vakil dike yeti ne hiraasat main poochtacha kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki unka muvakkil pehle hi paanch din police hiraasat main rah chukaa he jo iske liye jaruri samay se adhik he
 He also said that the police had already recovered documents from him
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘‘do mul dastavej sahit kai dastavej usase mili jo uske paas nahin hone chahie the
 The crime branch has informed that some documents of ministries which were not even published were also recovered from his possession

 Regarding the removal of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that the work of realizing the dream of Jana Sangh founder Shyam Prasad Mukherjee who sacrificed for the unity and integrity of the country has been done in Parliament

 isliye vah pradhanmantri or grih mantri ko badhai dete hai
 Regarding the Congress opposing the removal of Article 370, the Chief Minister said that it is meaningless to expect support from Congress for the removal of Article 370 because the Congress is doing the work it is meant for

 kabhicongreska garh rahe marwar main pichley chunaav main bhaajapa ne 39 seat jeet kar congress kaa kila dhaha diya tha
 Congress got just three seats in the account of the then Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, while one seat was won by independents

 In the 13th century, Rathore came to Marwar province and due to his valor he established his kingdom here
 marwar ke rathodon ke mul purush "raav siha' the, jinhone 1246 ke aas-paas marwar kii dharti par apana pair jamaaya
 In this dynasty, the son of Rao Ranmal, Jodhpur, founded Jodhpur in 1459 and removed the new capital from Mandore to Jodhpur

 In 1565, the Mughals took control of Jodhpur
 jodhpur rajya ke raav chandrasen ne 1570 main mughal shaasha akbar se bhent kii, lekin akbar ne unke pratidwandi bhai motaa raja udaisingh ko jodhpur rajya kaa shaasha maan liya
 Rao Chandrasen returned disappointed and continued to oppose the Mughals throughout his life
 1679 main mughal badshaah aurangzeb ne marwar par hamalaa kiya ise lutaa or yahaan ke nivaasiyon ko islam dharm sweekaar karne ko majaboor kiya, lekin jodhpur (marwar), jaipur or udaipur (mewar) kii riyasaton ne gathbandhan banaakar mughalon ke niyantran ko roke rakhaa
 Despite the strict control of Aurangzeb's empire in the 17th century, the Rathore family continued to have semi-autonomy in the region
 1830 ke dashak tak rajya par koi british prabhaav nahin tha
 But after this, during the time of Man Singh, the state became part of the subsidiary coalition and the king of Marwar (jodhpur) continued to rule as a native princely state
 saal 1947 main bharat kii aazaadee ke samay jodhpur rajya ke antim shaasha maharaja hanvant singh ne bharat main vilay ke prastaav par hastakshar karne main deree kar di
 Due to the border of Jodhpur with Pakistan, the ruler here had indicated the merger of Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Pakistan
 lekin ant main ve apane rajya kaa bhartiya ganraajya main vilay ke liye sahamat ho gaye lekin antim samay ke naatakeey ghatnakram ke baad
 Political history of Marwar: Democracy was established after independence ended the monarchy in the country
 chunki rajput shaasha or samant rahe, isliye gaiyr rajput jatiyaan inaki dabangai kaa shikaar banati raheen
 After losing the vassals of Rajputs, the Rajputs of Rajasthan became fiercely opposed to the Congress, while Jats, Gurjars and other castes became supporters of the Congress
 rajasthan ke shekhavati, marwar anchal main congress kii sarkaron ke saath mil kar jaaton ne apni raajnneeti khub chamakaayi
 Throughout the Shekhawati, Marwar region, Jats continued to win the election of MLA and MP on Congress party ticket
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti main marwar ke kshatrapasiton ke lihaaj se sabase bade kshetra marwar ko rajasthan kii raajnneeti main bharpoor pratinidhitiv mila
 Also, Marwar gave many veteran leaders to the state
 inamen nathuram mirdha, parsaram maderna, khetsingh rathod, poonamchand vishnoi, ramsingh vishnoi, gangaaraam choudhary, madhosingh dewan pramukh the
 There was a time when the politics of Marwar used to be changed at the behest of these people
 yah marwar ke kshatrapon kaa hi kamaal tha jab apatkaal ke pashchaat varsh 1977 main congress kaa puure uttar bharat se supada saaf ho gaya, lekin nagaur main jat netaa nathuram mirdha ne apane dam par jeet hasil kar sabhi ko apni majboot pakad kaa ahsaas kara diya
 The Congress won 26 seats out of the 42 seats in Marwar in the post-emergency Assembly elections on the basis of the satraps of Marwar
 lekin ek kahawat he ki bargad ke neeche ghaas bhi nahin punap sakati, isi tarah in netaaon daur main dwitiya pankti ke netaa punap nahin paae
 Due to which, the dominance of the satraps ended with their elimination
 kshatrapon ke nahin rahane kaa khamiyaja sabase adhik congress ko uthaanaa padaa
 The old satraps of the Congress not only took their own caste together but kept other small caste groups attached to it
 iskaa laabh unhen chunaav main hameshaa miltaa rahaa
 Later, Congress leader Ashok Gehlot chose Marwar for his karmabhoomi and was the chief minister of the state twice, winning the region continuously
 saal 2013 kii prachand satta virdohi or modi lahar main gahalot apni seat to bachaa paae lekin marwar yani congress ke majboot garh ko bhaajapa ne dhaha diya
 There has been no strong satire in BJP from Marwar and BJP politics revolves first around Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and now Chief Minister Vasudhara Raje
 vasundhara or centre sarkaar main marwar ko mila pratinidhitivvasundhara sarkaar main marwar ko pratinidhitiv mila, jiske tahat gajendra singh khinvsar, surendra goyal, pushpendra singh, amararam, kamasa meghavaal or otaraam devasi ko sarkaar main mantri banaaya gaya
 At the same time, there are two ministers from the Marwar region in the Modi government of the Center
 jodhpur saansad gajendra singh shekhavat or paali saansad peepi choudhary ko modi sarkaar main mantri banane kaa mauka mila
 Not only this, Marwar got three Rajya Sabha mps
 om maathur, ramnarayan dudi or narayan pancharia rajyasabha bheje gaye
 Therefore, the BJP left no stone unturned to keep Marwar in the hands of the Congress
 jab 2013 main dhare rah gaye congress ke jaateey samikaransaal 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa jaadu logon ke sir chadh bolaa
 This was the reason that all the caste equations were stagnated and the Congress in its strongest stronghold in the state got upset
 marwar ke sabase bade jaateey samooh jat or rajput samaaj ne kandhe se kandhaa mila bhaajapa kaa saath diya
 Both of them got the support of small castes and the Congress lost its stronghold
 ab kya hai halaat ?pichley paanch saalon main halaat kaaphi badal chuke hai
 According to local analysts, this time there is no such wave in Marwar
 jat-rajput samaaj main rajya sarkaar ke prati naaraazgi jag jaahir he
 At the same time, some small castes also resent their neglect
 aise main mukhyamantrivasundhara rajeke liye is bargaurav yatraamein pichley vidhansabha chunaav se pehle yojit parivartan yatra ke samaan utsahvardhak rahane ke asaar kam hi najar aa rahe hai

 The prime ministerial BJP candidate emphasized that he considers all Indians equal and it is his responsibility to join all sections of society, including Muslims
 unhone kaha, 'gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke rup main, maine yathasambhav rajya ke chah karod logon se judane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Now i have been entrusted with national responsibility
 main 125 karod logon se judane ke liye apane str se sabhi prayaas karanga
 This is part of my responsibility and i must do so
 ' Modi said, "it may be 100 steps and i can walk three, walk five or walk seven steps
" yah alag vishay he
 But it is my responsibility that i should make authentic efforts to reach every citizen of the country, every citizen of my state
 ' He was answering questions in a news channel program where he indicated his efforts to get in touch with the Muslim community
 jab modi se vishesh rup se poocha gaya ki kya har naagarik tak pahunchane ke unke prayaason main muslim shaamil hai to unhone kaha, 'main is terminology main kabhi jane vaala nahin hum
 Even if you tie the rope and take me, you will not be able to take it
 main mere deshavaasiyon ko miloongaa
 i understand the same language that he is a resident of India, he is my brother
 aap jis color se dekhnaa he, aapaki marji
 Modi is not going to go in that color
 ' He said, 'if i lose the election tomorrow then i will lose, i have no problem
 lekin desh ko tabah kar diya is bhashaa ne, barabaad kar diya he aap logon kii soch ne, us soch ko main kabhi nahin maanoonga or aap kripaya meri swatantraaa par is prakaar ke hamale karnaa band kar dijie
 ' modi ke saamne ram mandir or samaan naagarik samhita ke mudde bhi rakhe gaye jo bhaajapa tathaa muslimon ke bich duuri kii badi vajah maane jate rahe hai
 He was asked if he would be able to complete them due to his flamboyant image
 bhaajapa kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne spasht kiya ki in vishyon par vah samvidhan kaa paalan karenge
 He said, 'the country does not run with fire
 desh samvidhan se chalata he, desh sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon se chalata he or desh aage bhi samvidhan kii maryaada se hi chalane vaala he
 a firearm is for elections, not for running the country
 ' Modi was also asked if his work as Prime Minister would reflect the imprint of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as he had been associated with this organization since childhood
 jawaab main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'pehali baat he mujhe sarkaar chalaani he
 The government operates under the Constitution and i believe that the government has only one religion - India First
 sarkaar kii ek hi pavitra pustak hoti he-hamaara samvidhan
 The government has only one devotion - Bharat Bhakti and the government have the same working style - Sabka Saath, everyone's development
 ' When it came to the 2002 riots, Modi said that he has come out of all the criteria and is ready for every test in future
 lekin kabhi jhooth or raajnneetik iraadon ke aage nahin jhukenge
 He said, 'I have answered every question all the time till 2007
 aapako bura lage yaa bhala lage or aap chaaho ki main aapse dab jaau to yah hone vaala nahin he
 ' samprag sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue modi ne kaha ki upie ne 'shadyantr karke court, kachhariyon main, ucchtam nyaayalay tak mujhe ghasita
 Then i felt that i should not say anything now because the Supreme Court should not be influential
 ' He also referred to the interrogation done by the authorities in this matter
 modi ne kaha, 'aaj tak hindustan ke kisi mukhyamantri se kisi police vaale ne nau ghante tak poochtacha kii he? yah mukhyamantri he jisase police adhikari ne nau ghante tak poochtacha kii thi
 This was done on the order of the Supreme Court
 in sab kasautiyon se niklaa hum or aage bhi har kasuti ke liye taiyaar hum
 ' jab modi se unki party ke netaa giriraaj singh ke is bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya ki 'modi kaa virodh karne waalon ko pakistan chale janaa chahie' to pradhanmantri pad ke bhaajapa ke ummidavaar ne kaha, 'koi isse sahamat nahin ho saktaa
 ' unhone kaha, '2002 ke chunaav main jeetne ke baad main maninagar main mere matadaataaon kaa dhanyavad adaa karne gaya tha
 That day i said in my speech that this government belongs to those who have voted, this government belongs to those who have voted in opposition, this government is also those who did not go to vote
 ' When asked about the different views of BJP leaders on the action taken on Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra for alleged irregularities in land deals, Modi made it clear that he would focus on development instead of such issues and thus The subjects of will be dealt with as per law
 unhone kaha, 'ham paanch saal ke liye aate hai or in paanch saal main ye kooda-karkat lekar ghoomte rahenge yaa kuch acha karenge
 My personal opinion is that my strength should not go into this litter
 meri shakti sakaaratmak kaaryon main lage, acha karne main lage
 Otherwise the time of five years is very less
 agar ham isamen uljhe rahenge to desh kaa kya bhala karenge
 ' mukhyamantri ke rup main apane itane saal ke kaarykaal kaa ullekh karte hue modi ne kaha, 'meraa 14 saal kaa anubhav bataata he ki maine kabhi kisi kii file kholi hi nahin
 i have been of the opinion that if i got entangled in it, i would have entered into it
 main koi acha kaam nahin kar paata
 In 14 years i have only focused on positive things
 mujhe puraani chijen maaloom tak nahin hotin
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki koi kanoon se upar nahin hota
 Suppose there is an accusation against Narendra Modi and tomorrow if he becomes the Prime Minister then should he not be tried because he became the Prime Minister
 aisa to nahin hona chahie
 When asked whether he was expected to be criticized on the subject in relation to the controversy over information on marital status in the affidavit submitted during Modi's nomination to Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, he said, 'I am not surprised by anything' Nothing happens in my life aisi bhi baaten chalati hai
 Now they (opponents) do not have any subject, so what to do, they will keep doing it
 ' In fact, for the first time, Modi has admitted in his affidavit that he is getting criticized

 com / xd92ytjamw— Ajit Tyagi (@_ajittyagi)october 20, 2019aage sanjay singh ne kaha, 'ek saansad ko 5 hajaar unit bijli pratimah muft milti he, use khatm karne ke bare bijepi saansad nahin sochate, lekin arvind kejariwal sarkaar dwaara aam aadmi ko 200 unit bijli muft mil rahi he to use khatm karne kaa elaan kar rahe hai
 The public will never forgive such a party
 janata ne man bana liya he 200 unit muft bijli yojana jari rahegi or aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or majbootee se vaapasi karegi
 Asking the question, Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh said, 'tell the BJP people, has there ever been relief to the poor in any state? Why 5
 50 lakh karod puunjipatiyon ke maaf kar die? 10
 50 lakh crores became NPA and why 1 lakh 76 thousand crores were taken from RBI to compensate it? If the Kejriwal government is providing cheap electricity, then what are the votes? If you are giving relief to the poor, then are you buying votes? ”on the other hand, BJP leader Vijay Goel has retaliated in Delhi on the statement of ending subsidy
 unhone kaha, 'sabsidi khatm karnaa yaa naa karnaa yah hamaari sarkaar par depend karegaa
 At the same time, Vijay Goyal has claimed that if our government comes to power, then we will provide cheap electricity from the Kejriwal government to the people of Delhi
 sasti bijli kaa formulawijay goyal ne dilli main sasti bijli dene ke liye formula pesh kiya
 He said, 'we will provide competition in power companies as well as implement solar panels more and more so that the demand for electricity is reduced and the supply will be more, which will provide cheaper electricity
 sasti bijli kaa haq har vyakti kaa he
 Along with this, all the central government schemes will also be implemented in Delhi
 'kejariwal par saadhaa nishaanavijay goyal ne kejariwal par aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'kejariwal sarkaarne centre sarkaar kii kisi bhi yojana ko dilli main lagu nahin kiya he
 Kejriwal government is not enemy of poor but enemy
 kejariwal sarkaar chunaav se 2 maheene pehle free bijli kar-karke vot batorne chaahati he
 If Delhi's government really had sympathy, it would have given 5 years of free electricity
 bijepi jo bhi yojana lekar aegi vah shuruyaat ke 5 saal se lekar aegi
 He further said, 'there is no point in removing subsidies, cheap electricity has to be given
 bijli companiyon ko ek jeb se tex par kaa paisa duusare kii jeb main daal rahi he
 At the same time, when our government comes and whatever plan we have, whether it is free or cheap electricity, it will be for 5 years and not for 2 months before the elections

 piemo india ne jaise hi ravivaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kii man kii baat main kashmir par diya bayaan twit kiya, purv videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne us par chutki lete hue likhaa 'modi bhakton, ek or tamaacha? ab to samaj jaao
 After this, Aaj Tak had a special conversation with Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Kashmir and his tweet, here are the highlights of the conversation
 piem ne kashmir par jo kaha us par aapane unke samarthakon par hamalaa kyon bol diya?salmaan khurshid- haa maine bolaa lekin sach ye he jo ham arase se kehete aa rahe hai, vah ab jaakar pradhanmantri samaj paae hai
 The Prime Minister has now said what we used to say
 isliye main kahana chahta hum kijammu kashmiramen jo hinsa hui usamen ham is baat ke aaropee rahe ki ham ne maare gaye naujavaanon ke saath surakshakarmiyon kii shahadat ko saath jodakar bayaanbaji kii
 But at that time we were targeted
 isliye aaj jab pradhanmantri ne kah diya ki suraksha karmiyon ke saath-saath aam logon kii jaan jane kaa bhi mujhe dukh he, to bada sukun mila
 i had said the same thing earlier, for which i was declared as anti-national
 itnaa hi nahin twitor par mujhe deshadrohi hi nahin pakistan kaa simpethesizer kaha gaya
 Then i wrote that the slap is on Modi's supporters, what i used to say earlier is what Modi ji has said today
 modi ji ko dhanyavad
 Hopefully we will proceed on this line
 lekin ab vah modi bhakt kahaan he jo mujhe us vakt beizzat karte the jab main vahi bolta tha jo aaj modi ji ne bolaa
 Today the Indian government is moving ahead in terms of its policy, do you think there should be a dialogue with the Hurriyat on this occasion? Salman Khurshid - The Prime Minister and the Home Minister do not speak clearly on the question of talking to the Hurriyat, but meeting the Prime Minister, Chief Minister Mehbooba, Senior separatist leaders call Geelani as their father, they ask for peace together, but the question arises that from the Indian government, a It was not announced that what is the Hurriyat in the conversation with everyone? By the way, if Modi ji has any new formula to solve Kashmir issue, he should do public, Congress will support in the interest of the country, but the regret is that when we say in the beginning we are called anti-national, and Later our line is adopted
 ye hamaari sharmindagi he yaa pradhanmantri ji aapke salaahkaaron kii kamjor jaankaree? haa ham khush hai kii aakhirkaar aapane vahi kahana or karnaa shuru kar diya jo kabhi ham kaha karte the
 That is why i say that Modiji understood it, but Modi's devotees and soldiers could not understand
 kashmir maamle par kya hurriyat se baatcheet honi chahie yaa nahin?salmaan khurshid- ham to yahi kahenge kii pachaas dinon ke karfu ke baad kashmir main shanti honi chahievajpeyi jeene kashmiriat insaaniyat jamhuriyat ke naare ke saath jo ranneeti apanaai thi modi ji us naare ko to saath rakh rahe hai lekin kya wo ranneeti bhi apanaayenge hamako nahin maaloom
 But it is sure that even today the same strategy will be successful which Manmohan Singh ji and Atal ji used
 sawaal yah he kii aaj kii sarkaar sarvadaleey baithak main bhi yah nahin bataati ki uske paas kashmir mudde ke hal kaa kya formula he
 So far nothing is clear
 isi vajah se 50 din paar kar gaye hai kashmir main karfu he or itane dinon baad pradhanmantri bayaan de rahe hai
 Now this is the correct statement, but why after so many days
 aakhir pehle koun si ranneeti apana rahe the jo kashmir main aag badhati ja rahi thi
 Well, better late than never
 baluchistan gilgit or pioke main rahanevaale beghar log jammu, kathua or aasapaas rahane ko majaboor hai, unke liye bharat sarkaar ne 2000 karod ke fund kaa elaan kiya iske kya myne hai?salmaan khurshid- hindu sharnaarthiyon ke liye bharat ke daravaaje hameshaa khule rahe hai
 This has already been the promise of governments
 ab yah sarkaar bataae ki jin logon ke bare main baat kar rahi he unka record kya he
 How far has the investigation reached, is the strike right? We want to say that the UPA government had opened the doors for Hindu refugees, so the government should openly tell everyone what is being done
 ham bhi maamle ko sahi maanakar sarkaar kaa saath denge
 Because the rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits who live in different parts of the country living in Kashmir is our priority
 par sawaal yah he ki modi sarkaar unke bare main koi gambhir kadam uthaane ke bajaay pioke gilgit baluchistan kaa naam lekar siyasat karnaa chaah rahi he
 Does the Government of India support the Kashmir policy or is the Congress party with Modi's Kashmir policy? Salman Khurshid - We want to move forward on the formula of Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 We are with him but if the Modi government has If there is a new formula, bring it forward
 congress party desh hit main saath khadi hogi lekin afsos kii baat yah he ki koi bhi formula aadhikarik taur par saamne nahin aayaa he isliye ham sirf kehete hai kii jaldbaaji main or ahankaar main koi kadam uthaane se pehle kashmir ke maamle main sanjeeda hokar kadam uthaae jaaen
 If the Congress Party is consulted, it will always support it in the interest of the country, but the questions that are in front of it, why so much delay in bringing the strategy to the forefront and secondly that you are moving forward on the same strategy that you are saying today
 congress party raashtra hit main modi sarkaar ke har kadam ke saath he

 Rita of Channavar village in Jamui district wants to help people in the field of education by becoming a social worker
 lekin uske is armaan ke paravaan chadhane se pehle hi 17 disambar, 2011 kii raat bhakpa maovadiyon (naksaliyon) ne gaanv ke middle skool ko dhwast kar uske khwaabon main khalal daal diya
 Even his studies were affected by this, he has also started to fear the fate of his brothers and sisters
 uski do badi bahanon ko isliye kam umr main byaah diya gaya kyonki ve nirakshar thim
 Her brother left school after the fifth because there was no institute for further education
 ab reeta is ummid ke saath us tuuti-phooti imaarat main padhai kar rahi he ki shaayad halaat sudhar jaaen
 She says in a questioning tone, "what a mess did we do that got our aspirations mixed into the soil
" ''reeta akeli nahin he, jiske khwab toote hai
 Channavar Middle School has 235 students including Nepali, Bablu, Chhotu and Renu, who face more or less similar situations
 chhathi jamaat kii indra ko hi len
 She wants to study and become a school teacher, but the condition of the school has made her restless
 tajjub yah ki jharkhand ke giridih or bihar ke navada jile kii seemaa par jamui jile ke is gaanv ke bacchon main shiksha hasil karne kii bhukh kuta-kuta kar bhari hui he
 Renu student of class VIII says, "my elder sister and brother could not study
 main is kami ko teacher banakar puraa karnaa chaahati hum
 "people in the village have become aware about education
 magar naksaliyon kii karatuuton se unki ummiido ko palitha lagata najar aa rahaa he
 Teachers are seen shying away from going to school
 aise hi ek shikshak vijay kumaar deputesan par block main kaam kar rahe hai
 The special thing is that the Naxalites have mostly blown up the schools which were used as police camps and polling stations
 jaisaa ki chananwar ghatana ke pratyakshdarshi teacher sudama bhakt bataate hai, ''maovadiyon kaa aakrosh skool main police camp ko lekar tha
 They blew up the school by warning the villagers not to camp here again
 '' yahi nahin, suraksha kaarnon se bhi naksali do-manjila skool imaaraton ko udaate rahe hai
 Schools are also targeted to attack economic resources
 sthaneey log ajeeb kashmakash main fanse hai
 They are in danger of life if the Naxalites oppose destroying school buildings and fear of being accused of being pro-naxalites for opposing the police camp
 iske chalate ve mookadarshak ban sab kuch hota dekhne ke liye vivash hai
 In both circumstances, the education of children is being affected
 skulon kii tuuti-phooti imaaraton ke punarniman main prashasnic laachaargi saaf jhalkati he
 Due to this, most of the buildings demolished are intact
 haalanki sarkaar ne skulon main police camp sthapit na karne kaa aadesh de rakhaa he
 But local people say that whenever there are campaigns against Naxalites, then in practice that instruction cannot be followed
 bihar ke police mahanideshak abhayanand ne india today ko bataaya, ''ab rajya main koi bhi aisa skool nahin he, jahaan police camp he
 Police camps have been shifted from schools to quarters
 ''vahiin varisht naagarik sangh skulon par hamale kaa alag kaaran maanata he
 Former national vice-president of the union, Srinandan Sharma, says, "illiteracy and poverty have been the basis of Naxalites
 unhen dar he ki jab log pard-likh jaaenge tab kshetra main unki pakad dhili pad jaaegi
 Therefore, it is a conspiracy by the police to deprive children of education in the name of enmity
 '' jamini hakeekat yah he ki naksali hamalon main zyada nuksaan un logon kaa ho rahaa he, jinke ve hitaishi hone kaa dambh bharte hai
 In Patna last week, Union Home Secretary R
K
 ke
 Singh also said the same thing, "in the name of protection of the poor and tribals, the Naxalites have killed them the most and have damaged them in every way
" ''kendriya grih mantralay ne bhi is samasya se nijaat ke liye naksal prabhavit nau rajyon main 400 anti naksal police steshnon kii manjuuri de di he
 Of these 85 are for Bihar, which is the highest compared to any other state
 har thane ke nirmaan main do karod ru
 Will cost
 chananwar jamui kaa iklauta aisa skool nahin he
 The Garhi of Khaira block in the district, Bhalsudhiya of Sono block, Mahesari, Sarakanda, Charaka stone, Chormara and Gurmaha school of Barhat block are falling victim to Naxalites
 chananwar ke halaat dhwast skulon ke bacchon kii mushkilon ko samajhane kii baangi bhar hai
 In addition to Jamui in Bihar, 46 schools have been targeted in Naxalite affected districts like Banka, Munger, Aurangabad, Gaya, Kaimur, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran and East Champaran in the last six years
 dekha jaae to ausatan dedh maheene ke antaraal par ek sarkari skool ko dhwast kiya gaya he
 According to the Union Home Ministry report, 258 schools of the country were blown up from 2006 to November 2011, including 46 schools in Bihar
 naksaliyon ne is avadhi main sabase zyada chhatisgarh main 131, jabaki jharkhand main 63 or bihar main 46 skool dhwast kar die, bihar ke skulon kii sankhya thodi kam jarur he
 But the special thing is that the state has come in the line of those four Naxalite affected states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, which have increased in such incidents
 aisi ghatnaon se upji paristhitiyon se nipatane ke liye upaay kiye ja rahe hai
 The Union Tribal Welfare Affairs Ministry has decided to open an ashram school for the education of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes children of Naxalite affected and backward areas
 iske tahat rajya ke jamui, rohtas, bhabhua, munger, baankaa, navada or gaya main awasaiya suvidhayukta skool khole jaaenge
 But it is considered a long process, which will take time
 bihar police ne skool se maharoom bacchon ko jodne ke liye phir se abhiyaan shuru kiya he, lekin unhen imaarat viheen skulon se jod paanaa ahm sawaal he
 However, whatever the reason, the incident of Naxalite attacks on schools, and the subsequent circumstances, make one wonder whether it is a crime to see the golden dream of a small eye

 <justice Somashekhar Commission investigating the case of serial attacks in Karnataka in 2008 has given a 'clean chit' to the ruling BJP and organizations associated with the Sangh Parivar
 ek sadasyeey ayog ne sarkaar ko saunpi gai apni report main kaha he ‘isai yachikakartaon kii is ashanka kaa koi aadhaar nahin he ki raajnneetijna, bhaajapa, sangh parivaar or rajya sarkaar hamale main pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se shaamil hai
 According to the report submitted to Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, the issue of the distribution and conversion of literature which was used to incite offensive language against Hindus were the main reasons for the attack
 sitambar 2008 main mangalore, udupi, chikmagalore, kolar, chikballarpur, bellari or daavangere jilon main girjagharon par hamale kiye gaye the
 The Commission termed the administration's action of locking places of worship and preventing devotees from praying as "unprecedented in the administrative process and history of constitutional administration"
 jab report saunpi gai tab grih mantri aar ashok or vidhi mantri es suresh kumaar bhi maujuud the
 The Commission has said in its report, 'true Hindus had no role in any direct or indirect attack on the churches
 ’haalanki isamen is baat kaa zikr he ki hamalaa karne vaale gyaat yaa agyaat sanghathanon se jude evam isai yaa isaiyat ke khilaaf gumraah kattarpanthi shararti tatwon ko is baat kii galatfahami thi ki unhen sattadhari party kii ore se sangrakshan diya jayega
 "also, the report refutes allegations of conversion on Roman Catholic churches
 isamen kaha gaya he ki shaadi yaa svaichhik maamalon ko chhod den to roman catholic girjagharon yaa iske sadasyon kii ore se dharmantaran karaane kaa maamla kahin se bhi jaan nahin padataa
 But the report said that there are clear indications of conversion by some groups and self-appointed or self-appointed clergy in Kolar, Bangalore, Chikkaballapur, Bellary, Davanagara, Chikmagalur and Udupi for commercial gains through the use of unaccounted local or foreign funds
 
 ayog ne sarkaar ko salaah di ki vah koi kanoon laakar is tarah ke samoohon kii gatividhiyon ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 ke daayre main niyantrit kare
 The report said that allegations of collusion of top police officers and district administration with the attackers have no merit
 sthiti se nipatane tathaa doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai main bhoomika ke liye police kii tarif karte hue ayog ne kaha ki sabhi jilon se sambandhit police ne sarvshereshth prayaas kiye or adhiktar shararti tatwon ko pakadaney main safal rahi tathaa badi sankhya main aarope patr daayar kiye gaye
 Giving further relief to the BJP government, which has faced tremendous allegations of being anti-minority after the attacks, the Commission said that there is no basis for the allegations that the current government is 'deliberately not paying attention to the interests of the minority Christian community'
 ’somshekhar ne samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki ayog ne apane samaksh daayar ek hajaar yachikaaon par vichaar kiya or lagbhag 800 gavaahon se jirah kii
 He said, 'this is a sensitive and complex matter entrusted to the Commission
 ’ mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ne kaha ki sarkaar report kaa adhyayan karegi or aavashyak karrwai shuru karegi
 The report, however, termed the entry of police into some church premises in Dakshina Kannada without complying with legal requirements as an "unreasonable, inconsistent and inexperienced step" and said it was a violation of religious interests and human rights protected under the Constitution
 isamen kaha gaya, ‘lekin isamen raahat kii baat yah he ki is bare main koi saboot nahin he ki yah kisi anya bal se prerit yaa prabhavit tha
 The Commission also mentioned that in some incidents in Dakshina Kannada, police and lathicharge on women and women was excessive
 report main peediton tathaa charchon ko paryaapt muaavja die jane kaa paksh liya gaya or kaha gaya ki abhi di gai muaavja raashi kam he
 The Commission said that it is true that some people involved in the conversion are getting funds from some sources including abroad and they are misusing this money in mass conversions of innocent and helpless people belonging to weaker section of society
 report main raay di gai ki hindu dharm ke liye ahitkar is tarah kii chizon ko rokane ke liye uchit kanoon banaae jane kaa kuch hindu sanghathanon kaa prastaav ‘uchit’ he
 This supported the urge of Christian organizations to take action against Bajrang Dal convenor Mahendra Kumar in accordance with the law, who had publicly said that the attacks on churches would be justified
 report saunpe jane ke vakt kaaphi naatak hua or yediurppa ne ayog ke adhyaksh se aagrah kiya ki sarkaar dwaara koi rukh apanaae jane se pehle report ke ansh saarvajanik nahin kiye jaaen lekin somshekhar ne kaha ‘yah meri ichha or visheshadhikaar he ki ise logon ke saamne laayaa jaae
 In its interim report submitted to the government in February last, the commission had blamed the Bajrang Dal and some other organizations for the attacks, but in the final report they were exonerated
 somshekhar ne kaha ki soochna ke adhikaar adhinium ke tahat logon ko report kaa saar jaanane kaa adhikaar he
 He also said that 'some sensitive portions of the recommendations have not been made public
 ’ karnataka pradesh congress samiti ke adhyaksh ji
 Parameshwara criticized the report saying that the 'elements behind it' have come out of the recommendations
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki ayog sach tathaa hamalon ke liye jimmedaar logon ko saamne laane main vifal rahaa he
 Congress spokesperson VS Ugrappa demanded a CBI inquiry into the attacks on the churches

 500 or ek hajaar ke note band hone se bharat main aarthik aatankwaad kaa khel band ho jayega
 Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI was playing this game in India
 NIA ne nakli noton par ek vishesh report taiyaar kii thi
 It was revealed that fake currency worth 400 crore rupees are present in the transaction in the Indian economy
 vaise to pakistan kii taraf se noton par lagaam lagane ke liye bharat sarkaar ne kai jaanch agencia ko kaam par laga rakhaa tha
 But Pakistan was not deterred by its antics
 pakistan kii kufia agency ISI bharat ke kilaaf aarthik aatankwaad ko badhaava dene ke liye mostwanted don daaud ibrahim kaa istemaal bhi kar rahi thi
 According to the NIA report prepared on fake notes, there are 250 counterfeit notes in every 10 lakh operated notes

 But in the coming time, it will be a big challenge for the investigating agencies that neither the new 500 and 2000 notes can be made by Pakistan nor can it be sent to India

 Indian captain Virat Kohli is in constant discussion during the ongoing Test series between India and Australia
 haalanki kohli abhi tak balle se kuch khaas kamaal nahin dikhaa sake hai lekin australia team, australia ke purv khilaadiyon se lekar vahaan kii media ke bhi nishane par hai
 Commenting on this nature recently, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said that the Australian media is the supporting staff of the Australian team
 unhen gambhirtha se lene kii jarurat nahin
 The comments ranchi test ke drow rahane ke baad australia media ko ek baar phir nishane par liya he
 In an article published on the Daily Telegraph, Virat was described as Donald Trump
 "viraat kohli sports kii duniya ke donald trump ban gaye hai
 Like President Trump, Kohli has also started blaming the media for everything
 " It is worth noting that the series was in controversy only after the Bengaluru Test match

 After the Ranchi Test drew, Kohli said that the players of the Australian team were tight on physio Patrick Farhat
 haalanki smith ne kohli ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya
 Virat said that 4-5 Australian players were taking Patrick well, i don't know why they were doing this
 vah hamaare physio hai or hamaara ilaaj karnaa unka kaam he
 i do not understand why they were doing this? On the allegations made by Captain Kohli, Steve Smith said that he never opposed the physio of the Indian team
 viraat bhale hi kah rahe hon, lekin mujhe aisa nahin lagata he
 After the draw of Ranchi Test, Australia has once again targeted the media

 Once again there was a round of accusations between the two teams
 ranchi test ke drow hone ke baad kohli ne kaha ki australian team ke khilaadiyon ne physio patric farhat par tanj kase
 However Smith rejected Kohli's claim
 viraat ne kaha ki 4-5 australian khilaadi patric ko bur-bhala le rahe the, mujhe nahin pataa ve aisa kyon kar rahe the
 He is our physio and it is his job to treat us
 mujhe samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki ve aisa kyon kar rahe the? captain kohli ke aaropon par steve smith ne kaha ki unhone kabhi bhartiya team ke physio kaa aapmaana nahin kiya

 By that time, everything was fine, the village was breathing and the culture was also alive, and the broken culture also kept the courtyards of the neighbors open, the faces were blissful in the meetings, the fields, the barns smiling, the paths of invisible danger did not hang on the way, There were also battles and the plots on the fields became a debate, turned into abuses, and the cacophony of lathis did not come to the village of Loha, but iron He had to come, so he came to battle, the part of the lathis was captured by the Parlohe
 Now the news of the body was starting to look as if the boat was going to be changed in Laga Laganga, there was a lot of resentment, reaching from one hamlet to another, sitting on the dunes
 Lagilog began to rise from there, the new map of the rosary was being drawn in whispering, devotion was split, the period of Kirtan was entangled in the net of castes, Harmony If you change your hands on Yama, you start dividing your life; Fences are distributed, market shares are distributed and concerns continue to circulate for years, now civilization has been counted
 Now there is no dispute about the well-defined everything, there cannot be controversy because many wagah borders of dialogue have been pulled there
 As time goes on, everyone has a great concern of his flag, the flag of the village is blushing in the withered corner

 After demonetisation, the government is promoting more and more cashless transactions
 logon ko i-wolet, petm, debit / credit card se lenden karne ko kaha ja rahaa he
 But cashless payments have not yet been made in most hospitals in Delhi
 notebandi ke 37 din baad ames or ram manohar lohia aspataal ab cashles hone kii taiyaari main jute hai
 The team of 'aaj Tak' reached Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to take stock of the cashless system
 nai dilli ke bichon-bich maujuud ram manohar lohia aspataal mencashke kul 5 counter hai
 In this, the 23 number counter is where the highest cash payment is taken
 ek din main dedh se 2 lakh tak cash ikattha hota he, lekin hairaani kii baat ye rahi ki is counter main swip mashin yaa online banking kii suvidha maujuud nahin he
 Parminder, account officer of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, who is taking payment from net banking, told 'aaj Tak' that after the Government of India rules came, we wrote to the bank and now 7 swipe machines are being installed on all the cash counters
 uske alaava hamane net banking se pement leni shuru kar di he
 Downloaded m-clip application on mobile
 isse koi bhi marij sidhe bank acount main transfar kar saktaa he
 Till now cash used to be deposited in the bank, but now everything is becoming cashless
 kai counter par swip mashin nahinprashasan ke is daawey ke baad ham ram manohar lohia aspataal ke sabase zyada vyast rahane vaale cash counter pahunche
 Cashier Vinod told here that many people come with the card for online banking
 400 ke aasapaas marij dinabhar main aate hai
 Many people do not have cash and ask to use the card
 vinod ne bataaya ki 2 number counter par swip mashin lag chukaa he, lekin yahaan laganaa baaki he
 After this investigation, our team reached the counter number 2 of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where the hospital administration claimed to have installed the swipe machine
 is counter main swip mashin rakhi hui thi
 The cashier told that payments from 250 to 1000 rupees are made at this counter
 online banking ke 20 se 25 marij ab yahaan aa jate hai or swip mashin kaa istemaal kaaphi bad gaya he
 Patients said - 100 percent online banking However, patients believe that hospitals are still not ready for online banking
 ajtak kii team ne ram manohar laal aspataal pahunche marijon ke parijan se baatcheet kii
 Tulichand, who came from Dwarka, said, "online banking should be 100 percent, because patients are very upset
 mujhe 1000 rupee kii dawaai leni thi, lekin swip mashin nahin thi, to waapas janaa padaa
 Then someone helped by giving cash and then bought medicine
 aspataal main to sabase pehle online banking kaa intjaam hona chahie
 The hospital staff was not aware of the plastic money
 Kishor had gone to AIIMS to treat his relative from Vasudhanra and now Ram Manohar Lohia has come
 donon hi jagah online banking na hone se pareshaan hai
 There is no plastic money machine in the hospitals and their staff is also not aware of it
 pehle inako samajhane main 10 minute lag jate hai phir inke net nahin chalata he yaa sarwar down ho jaataa he
 Working without cash is difficult
 sabhi ke liye plastic mani istemaal karnaa mumkin nahin, lekin dukh kii baat ye he ki sarkaar abhi tak koi intjaam nahin kar pai he
 It is evident that Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital is under the central government
 yahi vajah rahi ki prashasan yahaan cashles banking ke liye gambhir nazar aayaa
 The doctors at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital are also providing online banking and cashless money training to all their staff
 prashasan kaa daawa he ki aspataal ke andar bank of baroda kii branch hone kii vajah se online banking kii suvidha ko majbootee se muhaiyaa karaayaa ja rahaa he

 There is also no doubt that the central government needs to create new and detailed guidelines for online platforms as they do not currently have the same type of censors as on films and television

 isse pehle mahabuuba ko kaman saunpane se jude ek sawaal ke jawaab main khud mufti mohammad said ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki agar party chaahati hai to mahabuuba jarur is jimmedaari ko sanbhaalengi
 Recently, due to Saeed's alcohol health, reports were constantly coming in about making Mehbooba the CM
 bijepi sutron ne bhi sanket diye the ki jammu-kashmir ke siem ke taur par said kii beti mahabuuba mufti gathbandhan kii pehali pasand ho sakati hai
 It is believed that BJP has no objection to Mehbooba becoming CM, but if he becomes CM, BJP would like to make some changes in the cabinet
 varisht pidipi netaa naeem akhtar ne kaha bhi tha ki agar rajya main kisi or ko siem banane kii baat aati he to mahabuuba mufti par aam sahmati ban sakati he
 On the question of the new CM of the state, he had said, 'there is no such possibility at the moment
 lekin,mufti sahabpahale hi kah chuke hai ki mahabuuba mufti siem pad kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke liye sabase upyukt hai
 There is a consensus in the name of Mehbooba in the party as Mehbooba is constantly working to take the party forward and there is no dispute about her

 When we are vacationing in England, he is still in the mood for cricket
 vah khel ke prati kaaphi sachet rahete hai or kabhi adhik nahin khate
 Anjali said that her husband is very much at the forefront of hiding emotions and there is little hope that he will give his chance to dominate himself as he retires
 yah alag baat he ki sachin vishwacap jeetne ke baad bhaavnaatmak ho gaye the or us samay unki ankhen bhar ai thim

 Lying in the UK, the internal security minister Amber Rood had to resign
 unhone sansadeey samiti se yah jhooth bol diya ki unki sarkaar kaa baahar se aakar basane vaale imigrent ko nikaalane kaa koi lakshya nahin tay kiya he lekin jab gardian akhbaar ne unheen kaa likhaa hua patr chhap diya jisamen ve pradhanmantri therisa me se kah rahi hai ki imigrent ko nikaalnaa mushkil nahin he
 If the lie was caught, the minister had to resign
 jabaki ve kaaphi mahatvapurn kaam kar rahi thim or pradhanmantri kii kareebi maani jaati thim
 What happens in India? Recently you must have read a report in the Aadhaar case
 supreme court ne jab sarkaar se poocha ki hamane kab kaha tha ki mobile number ko aadhaar se link karnaa anivaary he
 Whereas in September 2017, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted that the Supreme Court has ordered that the mobile number be linked to Aadhaar
 supreme court ne jab poocha gaya ki telecom vibhaag ke circular main aisa kyon kaha gaya ki supreme court ne kaha he ki mobile sim ko aadhaar se link karnaa he
 Then the representative lawyers of the government started to give some more clarification
 mantri ji ne apane twit main jo jhooth bolaa tha us par afsos tak zaahir nahin kiya
 This is India
 yahaan jhooth hi chalata he
 God, Allah, God forgive all
 1 may kii shaam news channelon par pradhanmantri ke 15 minute banaam rahul ke 15 minute jaise jumale chal rahe honge
 In the final phase of the Karnataka elections, Prime Minister Modi said that in the language you like in Karnataka, if you can speak Hindi, then you can speak Hindi, then you can speak English
 aapaki mataji kii maatrubhaasha bolte hai to maatrubhaasha
 Without taking the paper in your hands for 15 minutes, you should tell your government's achievement in Karnataka in front of the people of Karnataka
 15 minute ke bhaashan ke darmyaan kam se kam 5 baar shriman vishwesraiya ji ke naam kaa ullekh kar dijie
 Just in the media, Haldine was told that Modi gave the answer to Rahul
 bilkul diya magar kya vahi kaha jo rahul ne kaha tha
 On April 23, Rahul Gandhi had said that Nirav is Modi's case, Lalit Modi's case, Vijay Mallya's case, Rafael's case, Narendra Modi is nervous about standing in Parliament
 main aapako bataa rahaa hum 15 minute vahaan par meri spich kara do, 15 minute vahaan modi ji ke saamne meri spitch kara do, 15 minute main rafel kii baat karuunga, neerav modi kii baat karuunga, modi ji vahaan par khadey nahin rah paaenge
 We have read the statements of both of them almost exactly
 ab aap antar dekhie
 Rahul said that in the case of Rafael case, Lalit Modi and Nirav Modi, Modi ji will not last even 15 minutes
 pradhanmantri ne rahul kii is chunauti par kuch nahin bolaa, 15 minute ko nikaal kar apana 15 minute rakh diya or apni sharten bhi
 What can be a better seasoning for TV
 donon ke hi bayaan aap gaur se dekhenge to tali bajwane vaale hai
 Like there were some scenes in the cinema for the first front stall, clapping sounded as soon as the action scene came
 yahi antar aapako samajhnaa he
 Neither Rahul Gandhi will speak 15 minutes on the achievement of his government nor Prime Minister Nirav Modi, 15 minutes on Rafale aircraft agreement
 magar media main or kal ke tamaam hindi akhabaaron main aapke saamne 15 minute banaam 15 minute kii hedline paros di jaaegi
 You too will enjoy the spectacle more than a game like an IPL match
 tivi isi tarah se aapako darshak banaata he, mudde ko gaayab kar detaa he or mudde ke naam par aapke saamne manoranjan paros detaa he
 This is the character of TV
 yahi pehle bhi hota tha, yahi aaj bhi ho rahaa he or yahi kal bhi hoga
 TV questions will be made your questions
 aap apane sawaal bhul jaaenge
 No one will debate the question of what is the opinion of Congress and BJP about pension
 unke bich kis tarah kii bahes he, bank karmchaariyon kii selary ko lekar, unke kaam karne kii sthiti ko lokar congress or bijepi main kisi bahes he, aadhaar ko lekar congress or bijepi ke bich kya bahes he, donon kaa angel kya he
 As long as you are part of the audience group, you are part of a crowd, you will really enjoy that if Rahul Gandhi bathed, then Modi also shook
 ye hua chakka
 As soon as you are separated from the crowd or group like Sixty year old Kanso Devi, you fall alone
 system aapako is kadar tod detaa he ki na to congress aati he na bijepi aati he, aapaki madad ke liye
 Kanso Devi does not live in the remote Daraz villages but lives in Delhi
 pati kii maut ke baad vidhwaa pension mil rahi thi lekin achaanak band ho gai
 Those three years are trying to find out why his pension was discontinued
 1500 rupee kii pension kyon band hui yah jaanane ke liye unhone soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi
 Four years passed when the Central Information Commissioner ordered that the mistake was not of Kanso Devi, but of the officials
 magar iske baad bhi conso devi ko pension nahin mili or na hi adhikariyon par jurmaana laga
 Why was this condition of Kanso Devi, because the responsibility of providing information under the right to information is given to the institutions which have buildings but they do not have commissioners
 isi 6 march ko dakshin dilli ke muniraka main pradhanmantri modi ne kendriya soochna ayukta ke five starnuma mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya
 The media report at the inauguration described the five-story building as state-of-the-art building and environment friendly
 magar 60 karod kii laagat se bani state of di art building main state kaa art dekhie ki yahaan hone chahie 11 ayukta magar chaar pad khaali pade hai
 Four more will retire by the end of this year, including the Chief Information Commissioner
 aap pradhanmantri kii website par jaaenge to vahaan ek behad khubasurat baat likhi he ki paardarshita ke zarie hi logon ko barabari kaa darja jiya ja saktaa he
 Even after this, there are no 11 of 11 Information Commissioners
 agar yah imaarat kuch kam khubasurat bhi hoti he, state of di art nahin bhi hoti or 11 ayukta hote to conso devi jaisi mahila ko apni pension kii soochna ke liye chaar saal chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Now think what is the condition of the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner, then what will happen in the states
 hrydayesh joshi kii report bataati he ki desh ke kai rajya aise hai jahaan soochna ayukta ke daftar main ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Isn't this a joke with the country's life
 niyam ke anusaar aabaadi or lambit maamalon ko dekhte hue har rajya main 11 soochna ayuktaon kii niyukti kii ja sakati he
 It has been four years since Andhra Pradesh was created, but there is not a single commissioner here
 kerala or uttar purv ke kai rajyon main sirf ek hi ayukta he
 Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand have only two Information Commissioners
 gujarat, goa or assam main teen-teen soochna ayukta hai
 Here also 8 posts are vacant
 bihar main maatr 4 soochna ayukta hai, yahaan bhi 7 pad khaali hai
 Right to information is not a general right
 adhikari jab bina baat ke janata ke kaam nahin karte hai to janata isi kanoon kaa sahaara lekar apana bachaav karti he
 But if there is no commissioner from the states to Delhi, then what will happen to the poor people who are wandering from here to there for pension, ration or other kind of government help
 35 saal kii rina anusuchit jati se hai
 Are divorced
 teen bachche saath hai
 They have to be sent to school
 fees kam ho iske liye jati pramaan patr chahie
 Belongs to Dakshinpuri of Delhi
 rajasav vibhaag ne kah diya ki bacchon ke pita kaa bhi jati pramaan patr chahie
 What are she doing now, she went to CIC
 artiai lagaai
 It's been two years, not yet told what the process is
 soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat jaankaree maangi to do saal se jaankaree nahin de rahe hai
 When the political party, the media does not support anyone, then with this RTI, these ordinary people are fighting for their right
 satark naagarik sanghathan kii report ke anusaar sirf soochna aayogon main kareeb 2 lakh se zyaada apil lambit he
 Based on this, it was estimated that more than 50 lakh cases may be pending in all the departments of the country
 matlab suchanaaen nahin di ja rahi hai yaa phir dene main deree kii ja rahi he
 The alert civic organization estimates that the condition of Bengal is that if you apply RTI there today, your appeal will be settled after forty years
 tippaniyan On 6 March, when the headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner was inaugurated in Delhi, a website called The Print published a report that commissioners have not been appointed for two years
 sitambar 2016 main do padon ke liye vigyaapan niklaa tha magar kisi kii niyukti nahin hui
 At the inauguration of the headquarters on 6 March, Prime Minister Modi said that 'the more transparency in the system, the easier the flow of information, the more the people's trust in the government increases
 nishchit taur par soochna ke is pravaah main rashtriya soochna ayog kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi he
 When the Prime Minister also believes that the flow of information will be easy, then people's trust in the government will increase, then why is a woman like Kanso Devi taking four years to get information
 kyon do saal se siaisi ke mukhyalay main ayuktaon ke chaar chaar pad khaali hai
 Not only this, if you read the media report, a large number of answers are not received from the information sought under RTI from the Prime Minister's Office, it is found that information is being submitted
 karnataka chunaavon ke antim charan main dhuandhar raily kii shuruyaat karte hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha he ki karnataka main aapako jo bhashaa pasand ho, us bhashaa main, hindi bol saken to hindi, angrezi bol sakate hai to angrezi
 If you speak your mother's mother tongue then mother tongue
 aap 15 minute haath main kaagaj liye bina karnataka main apni sarkaar kii achievement karnataka kii janata ke saamne bol dijie
