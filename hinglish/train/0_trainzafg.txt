 The Shiv Sena played the election bugle at a big rally in Mumbai on Thursday
 raily main jamaa hui baari bheed ke jariye shivasena ne apana shaktipradarshan bhi kiya
 During this, the party's president Uddhav Thackeray targeted the Congress and current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh fiercely
 uddhav thakare ne manmohan singh par ab tak ke sabase kamjor pradhanmantri hone kaa aarope lagaate hue daawa kiya ki desh bhar main congress virdohi lahar bah rahi he or unki party ke din gine-chune hai
 Thackeray alleged, 'I don't think there has ever been such a weak Prime Minister in the country
 ’ shivasena netaa ne apane pita or shivasena sansthaapak bal thakare ke janmdin par yahaan keji somaiya grounds main yojit ek jansabha main yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki piem ko unki apni party se bhi sammaan nahin miltaa he
 Thackeray started campaigning for his party and called upon Shiv Sena workers to work to remove the Congress from power
 shivasena netaa ne hindutv ko party kaa atyant mahatvapurn mudda qaraar dete hue kaha, ‘jab ham hindutv kaa mudda buland karte hai ve hamen sampradayik kehete hai
 Is it a crime in my own country to call myself a Hindu? '' Thackeray accused the Congress of 'dividing' the country for power and said that Congress policies are destroying us
 ’ unhone pradhanmantri pad ke bijepi ummidavaar narendra modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr kaha ki desh kaa aglaa pradhanmantri bijepi se or maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se hoga
 On not announcing Congress's prime ministerial candidate, Thackeray said, "there is an anti-congress wave in the country and in such a scenario who would want to sacrifice for that post
" ’ To overcome the political war of Gujarat, veteran leaders of Congress are meeting at 10 Janpath, residence of party president Sonia Gandhi

 Apart from scoring a double century in the World Cup quarter-finals, Martin Guptill has become just the fifth cricketer to show a double century in ODI cricket
 guptil se pehle vanade cricket main sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, rohit sharma or westeindies ke kris gail ne doharaa shatak lagane kaa karishma dikhaaya
 Although Guptill's double century is the sixth double century of ODI cricket, but India's Rohit Sharma has shown this feat twice in ODI cricket
 lekin kya aapako maaloom he ki vanade cricket main doharaa shatak lagane vaale in paanchon ballebaaz main ek khaas baat kaaman he
 What is that common thing? In fact, these five batsmen have also been playing a useful role as spin bowlers for their own team
 chaahe wo sachin tendulkar hon yaa phir virendra sahvaag, jab tak team india kii ore se khelte rahe, ballebaazi ke saath-saath part time spinner kii bhoomika nibhaate rahe
 While Sachin took 154 wickets in odis, Sehwag also has 96 wickets
 tufaani ballebaaz kris gail to 168 vanade wicket jhatak chuke hai
 Rohit, who has scored two double centuries in odis, also has 8 wickets in odis, while Guptill has 2 wickets
 in paanch joardaar ballebaazon kii spin gendbaazi main bhi ek khaas baat he - ye paanchon ke paanchon daaen haath se of brake gendbaazi karte hai
 By the way, there has been a trend in social media that all the Indians who have scored double centuries in ODI cricket are Indian - three are Indian, Gayle is West Indian and Guptill is being called Indian Gupta on social media
 vaise rohit sharma kii 264 ran kii pari or guptil kii noteout 237 ran kii pari main ek or baat kaaman thi
 Both catches were missed for 4 runs, after which both made history
 rohit sharma ne vanade cricket kaa sabase bada score banaaya, to guptil ne world cap kaa sabase bada score bana diya
 Apart from this, there is one more thing common between Rohit Sharma and Martin Guptill, both scored their first double century in the 103rd ODI
 guptil ne westeindies ke khilaaf apane vanade kariyar kii 103veen pari khelte hue doharaa shatak puraa kiya
 At the same time when Rohit Sharma scored the first double century of his career in Bengaluru against Australia in November 2013, it was Rohit's 103rd ODI innings
 sabase kam vanade pari khelkar doharaa shatak banane kaa record inhen donon ke naam he

 Kohli said, 'it feels good by winning
 kai maichon main ham badakismat rahe
 Not every match, but some matches we could have won
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘itane jatke jhelane ke baad bhi team main jeet kii lalak bani hui thi
 We thought there would be a score of 190, but the bowlers performed well and stopped them before that
 aath overon main 60 ran dekar chaar wicket lenaa acha tha
 'man of the match AB de Villiers said,' i waited a long time for this

 inamen pashchim bangala main chah charnon main matdaan hona he
 The Chief Minister of the state and the head of the ruling TMC, Mamata Banerjee has raised questions about this long-term election program
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah ayog ke nirnay kaa sammaan karti hai
 Reacting to the announcement of the dates, Mamta said, "the decision on the dates and stages of voting is the prerogative of the Election Commission
 ham iskaa sammaan karte hai or nirnay kaa swaagat karte hai
 But there are times when political parties talk negatively and spread confusion about our party
 'pa
 The Chief Minister of Bengal said, 'tamil Nadu has a lot of seats, but there is only one phase of voting
 yakeenan vahaan loktantric aadhaar par chunaav karavaaya ja rahaa he, lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki vahaan aisi koi jarurat he, kyonki sipiem or congress saath milakar chunaav maidan main utar rahe hai
 "bengal is normal compared to Assam" Mamata further said, "assam also has many problems
 kai partiyaan hai, lekin vahaan bhi do charnon main chunaav ho rahe hai
 The situation is much more common in Bengal than this
 yahaan sampradayik dange nahin hue or aapraadhik gatividhiyon main bhi kami ai he
 There is only development here
 'mukhyamantri ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin he ki raajnneetik dal kyon nakaaratmak khabaren failaate hai
 Mamta said, 'I have nothing to say against the Election Commission
 janata sabhi baton kaa jawaab degi
 ' kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki achche ladke hi pyaar main dhokhaa kyon khate hai? aakhir unhen hi pyaar main bevafaayee kyon sahani padati he? aksar aisa hota he ki bure ladakon ko acha jivan saathi mil jaataa he or un ladakon ke saath dhokhaa ho jaataa he jo puure dil se kisi rishte ko nibhaate hai
 Well, there can be many reasons for this to happen and here are some reasons why you will be surprised to know
 vaise saamaanya taur par kisi bhi rishte ke tuutane kii sabase pramukh or badi vajah vishwaas kii kami hoti he
 But if you leave it, then these reasons also cannot be ignored, due to which good boys fall prey to deception in most of the cases: 1
 zyaadaatar ladke apane past rilations ko apni vartmaan partner ke saamne jaahir nahin hone dete hai
 But honest boys aside from them start a new relationship only after telling everything about the past
 aise main ladki ko hameshaa ye andeh bana rahata he ki agar wo pehle kisi ko chhodkar uske paas aa saktaa he to use chhodkar kisi or ke paas bhi ja saktaa he
 Because of this, there is always confusion in the mind of the girl about the boy
 2
 Most good boys are commanding
 wo apni partner ko lekar bahut kelkulation karte hai lekin jaruri nahin ki unka ye vyavhaar har ladki ko pasand hi aae
 Most girls do not like that someone else tells them what they should and should not do
 ek ore jahaan ladke aisi roak-tok karke apni partner ko hameshaa surakshit rakhana chaahate hai vahiin jaruri nahin ki ye baat sabhi ko pasand hi aae
 3
 aise ladke niyam-kanoon ko maanane vaale hote hai
 They feel that if they are living their life rules then others should also stay the same way
 par itane niyam-kanoon or paabandiyon ke saath rahanaa har kisi ko pasand nahin aa saktaa he
 4
 jarurat se zyada khyaal rakhane vaale ladke bhi ladakiyon ko pasand nahin aate hai
 Many times they feel compelled to do this thought
 har ladki apane tareeke se jindagi jeena chaahati he
 He needs love but more care begins to irritate her and she starts thinking to end the relationship
 5
 Whether you believe it or not, it is true that such boys are limited in themselves
 unhen lagata he ki jo wo karte hai yaa kehete hai vahi sahi hota he
 Girls do not like to live with such boys

 Royal Enfield ne apni 7,000 se motorcykilon ko ricol kiya he

 a 5-speed manual transmission is available with this engine
 haal hi main company ne Bullet 350 or Bullet 350 ES ko single channel ABS ke saath launch kiya tha
 Royal Enfield Bullet 500 comes with 499 cc, single-cylinder, 4-stroke, spark ignition, air-cooled, fuel injection engine
 is ingine ke saath 5-speed gearbox miltaa he
 The front of this motorcycle has 280 mm disc with 2-piston caliper and 240 mm disc with single piston caliper in the rear

 If you have bought a house by taking a loan from the bank, EMI (equated Monthly Installations) can prove to be a huge burden on your monthly budget
 duusari taraf, iemi byaaj daron se nirdhaarit hoti he
 These days most new buyers of bank houses 8
 35-8
 They are giving loans at an interest rate of 5 percent
 lekin maujuuda kharidaaron ke liye ye byaaj dar thodi adhik ho sakati he, khaskar un kharidaaron ke liye jinhone 1 april, 2016 se pehle karj liya he
 On this date RBI has introduced a new benchmark for lending called MCLR which allows banks to set different benchmark rates depending on the duration of the loan
 isaki vajah se pehle vaali base dar tay karne kaa tarika khatm ho gaya
 Earlier there used to be different but not the same benchmark rate
 is nae benchmark ko repo rate kaa kahin zyada sateek pratibimb mana jaataa he jiske aadhaar par byaaj ko karj kii avadhi ke aadhaar par tay kiya ja saktaa he
 But on the other hand nbfcs (non-banking finance companies) and housing finance companies (hfcs) are still offering home loans at prime lending rate where the benchmark rate is decided on the creditworthiness of the borrower
 bhartiya rigerv bank kii taaja report ke mutabik, arabiai kii ore se disambar 2014 se repo rate (vah byaaj dar jisapar rigerv bank karj sansthaaon ko karj detaa he) main do fisadi kii kami karne ke baavjood desh bhar ke bainkon main karj kii ausat dar main keval 1
 Decreased by 25 percent, 0 after demonetisation
 5 pratishat
 In this way, interest rates have not been cut by banks as much as they should have been
 agar aapane pehle se bainkon se home lone le rakhaa he to byaaj daron main katautee karaane ke kai tareeke hai
 Option of MCLR: RBI has allowed the borrowers to adopt MCLR method for the house loan
 haalanki bank is vikalp ko apnaane ke liye bachi hui rakam par 0
 5 percent amount and take it as tax fee
 emsielaar kahin zyada paardarshee tarika he
 Therefore choosing this option can prove beneficial in the long term for the borrowers
 agar karj lene vaale ne 20 saal ke liye 50 lakh rupye kaa karj le rakhaa he or use is samay 9 pratishat kaa byaaj dar dena pad rahaa he to emsielaar ke vikalp par jane ke liye uski fees 25,000 ru
 Will be
 lekin us par jane se agar byaaj dar 8
 5 percent if interest becomes full 9
 3 lakh ru
 Will save home lone sthanantaranaap bache karj ko duusare bank main sthanantarit kar sakate hai jo kam byaaj dar kaa prastaav de rahaa ho
 The new bank repays your remaining loan to the existing bank and then EMI starts as per the interest rate of the new bank
 bank se molbhaipane bache hue karj ko nae bank main sthanantarit karne se pehle aap apane maujuuda bank se molbhav kar sakate hai
 When you tell an existing bank that you are planning to transfer your loan to another bank, most banks are ready to reduce your loan interest rate
 haalanki sthanantarit karne ke liye aapako kuch fees deni pad sakati he
 This fee means two-and-a-half thousand or may vary according to the bank
 koi bhi vikalp chune lekin aapako sabase pehle napha-nuksaan kaa hisaab laga lenaa chahie
 This helps you in both transfer fees and paper work
 aam taur par shuru ke dinon main hi is tarah ke faisle lenaa phydemand hota he

 Is it a matter of media freedom? Or a case of misuse of media freedom? a case of sensationalizing the highly sensitive business of news? Or a case of ISI threatening the media whose job it is to give the news without any pressure? Or the ISI case that is determined to suppress every voice that has come up against itself in 'unfair' circumstances? Or the case of media houses who are competing with each other to get maximum trps? There is no rule or principle left in this race to beat each other
 mujhe dar he ki in sawaalon kaa koi aasaan jawaab nahin he
 It allegedly began with a shootout in which Hamid Mir, Pakistan's biggest TV journalist and one of the highest-ranked (in the case of TRP) channel Jio, was seriously injured
 19 april ko karachi main hui is golibari main unhen kai goliyaan lagi thim
 Although the whole of Pakistan condemned the firing, Mir's brother probably reacted angrily to the Jio channel and openly attacked the ISI and its director-general Zaheerul Islam, accusing them of firing

 Allegations, counter-accusations, reconciliation efforts, taking the matter to PEMRA, sharp reporting, targeting other channels on Jio vigorous anti-jio campaign across Pakistan, announcing cancellation of Jio license of PEMRA members (PEMRA Unauthorized order revoked after this announcement), Jio apologizes to ISI and finally fined
 10 lakh rupye kaa jurmaana or 15 din ke liye license kaa nilamban
 Now Jio has sued ISI for defamation
 jang bad gai he
 And it has become even worse
 bahut se log aisa hi sochate hai
 i am worried about this situation, because Pakistan is once again in international headlines for the wrong reasons — the ban on youtube in Pakistan, the most dangerous country for journalists, where 71 journalists were murdered in 2013, where some area journalists Where intelligence agencies act like censorship authorities and where the punishment for 'speaking the truth' is extremely cruel and sometimes Death

 The field of journalism and its relationship of love and hate with ISI
 meri jaisi sidhi soch rakhane vaale logon ke liye is vishay kaa utaar-chadhaav bahut hi jatil he
 What is the significance of the battle of ISI vs Jio, which has become the center of discussion at this time in Pakistan, facing problems like terrorism, power shortage, economic plight, inflation, law and order plight? Is it to divert attention from the real serious problems of the country? Does Sheri Rahman (former Minister of Information, former Ambassador to the US, currently the President of Jinnah Institute) believe so? “jio has crossed a lot of boundaries, which a reputed channel should not have crossed
 lekin sensorship iskaa hal nahin he
 The regulatory authority needs to be completely reformed, but the rule cannot be called censorship
 ”yaa phir ayaaj amir (pratishthit stanbhakaar, jang group ke akhbaar da news main likhane vaale rajnatik vishleshak or purv saansad) kii baat main koi dam he
 “this crisis is related to only one media house
 yah puraa media ke saath nahin tha
 And the reason was that a particular media house went beyond limits
 haalanki main uske akhbaar ke liye likhata hum, lekin main is maamle main unka samarthan nahin karata hum
 This is not an attack on the entire media

 Someone is shot and anyone is charged, and his pictures are shown throughout the bulletin

 If you make any allegations, file an FIR

 He (jio) went beyond limits and later realized it too

 Because construction on these projects will not be possible till now, with the NBCC having a new framework for minimum cutting of trees

 In an exclusive conversation with our affiliate channel India Today TV, Manohar said, "the BCCI did not make any effort to improve its image
" ab board ke paas lodha cameti kii siforeeshon par amal karne ke alaava koi or rasta nahin he
 In his first TV interview in the last five years, Manohar lashed out at n Srinivasan, stating that he should have stepped down from his post at the time of the 2013 spot-fixing scandal

 No person is greater than the institution, Srinivasan is the root of all the controversy

 Chandrababu Naidu will go on a day hunger strike
 20 april ko apane janm din ke maukey par vah amravati main ek din kaa upwas rakhenge
 This strategy of Naidu is believed to be the beginning of a political campaign on which the Third Front is to be united against the Modi government
 bakaul naidu, ‘hamaari maang he ki andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mili
 At the same time, the benefits to be obtained under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, whose assurances were given by the government in the Rajya Sabha, but have not yet been received

 Apart from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar has also been demanding special status for a long time

 Hence Naidu is expected to get support from these states
 sutron kaa kahana he ki, darasal naidu is maukey ko tisare morche ke gathan kaa avasar bhi bananaa chaahate hai
 Among all the parties that will support this fast of Naidu, the remaining parties can come under the umbrella of the Third Front, except aces-dukes
 vidit ho ki telugana ke siem pehali hi tisare morche kii pahal kar chuke hai or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne unka samarthan kiya
 Now if Mamata comes in favor of Naidu, then the way to move towards the Third Front can be easy

 dilli ke alji anil baijal ne kejariwal sarkaar ke mahatvakankshi mohalla clinics ke prastaav ko anumati de di he
 However, now questions are arising as to how the government will fulfill the dream of 1000 Mohalla clinics without land and infrastructure
 alji ne prastaav paas karne ke saath hi salaah di he ki sarkaar mohalla clinics main marijon kii uchit nigaraanee ke liye 6 maheene ke andar baiametric online system lagu kare
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party government had claimed to build 1000 Permanent Mohalla clinics all over Delhi
 philhal dilli main permanent mohalla clinics kii sankhya kam he, jabaki zyaadaatar clinics kiraye ke kamaron se chalaae ja rahe hai
 The total number of Mohalla clinics in Delhi so far is just 162
 iske alaava kai permanent mohalla clinics bhi taiyaar kiye gaye hai, jiname sarkaar dwaara niyamon kii andekhi kii vajah se ilaaj shuru hi nahi ho paaya he
 At present, there is a big challenge before Arvind Kejriwal to find new land and create infrastructure for Mohalla clinics

 On the question of not getting land for Mohalla clinics, Sanjeev Jha said, 'everyone should work together for the development of Delhi
 mohalla clinics ke liye puri koshish kii ja rahi he, kyonki kai jagahon par land pehle se chun lee gayi he
 There are more than 10 places in my assembly, but till now the work was stalled due to not passing the file
 ummid he 2 maheene main zyaadaatar mohalla clinics kaa seoup puraa ho jayega
 Describing the reason of the lack of land for the DDA and Delhi government, the Sangh Jha said that there is a lot of Gram Panchayat or farm land in the assembly adjacent to the village, but the main reason for the problem is not the land of DDA and Delhi government
 'aap' vidhayak sanjeev jha ke mutabik peedblyoody kii jameen par mohalla clinics khulegaa yaa nahin, is par ek badi duvidha thi
 PWD land was found in many places, but there were toilets around
 jha kaa kahana he ki ab alji ne anumati di he to ummid he jahaan clinics nahi khulaa tha, vahaan bhi khul jayega or sab saath milakar adchanon ko dur karenge
 BJP said the base of corruption
 Delhi BJP state president Manoj Tiwari has called the Mohalla clinic as the base of corruption
 tiwari ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki mohalla clinics ke zarie arvind kejariwal ne bahut bhram failaae, jo iske asafal hone kii badi vajah bani he
 Announced without a plan, which clearly means that Kejriwal does not know how to work
 sarkari tantra main samvidhan ke tahat kaam karnaa hota he, lekin bina yojana ke kejariwal ghoshnaa karte rahe
 Kejriwal is the enemy of transparency
 alji sahab sanvaidhanik tareeke se apni baat rakh rahe hai, lekin kejariwal samvidhan ko taar-taar kar rahe hai
 Currently, LG Anil Baijal, while passing the proposal of Mohalla Clinic, has strongly advised that the doctors and staff appointed in Mohalla clinics should be qualified in every way, who should be appointed in a transparent manner
 iske alaava marijon kii gopneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye praryaapt suraksha intjaam karne ke nirdesh bhi die gaye hai
 In a statement issued by the LG office, the government has clearly stated that the conditions fixed by the owner or agency of the land concerned for the use of the land or any construction should be strictly followed

 aise main unhen mantri pad par banane rahane ke liye 6 maheene ke andar soobe ke kisi ek sadan kaa sadsy hona laazmi tha
 In such a situation, these ministers are completing 6 months on September 19, before this date line, they will have to become members of the House
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi apane in paanch mantriyon ko vidhaan parishad ke jariye sadan main laane kii vyavastha kii he
 While the Election Commission had earlier issued a decree to conduct mid-term elections from four MLC seats to only four seats
 aise main yogi sarkaar ke kisi ek mantri kursi jaani tay mana ja rahaa tha
 It was said that Mohsin Raza's chair was in more danger
 darasalyogi adityanathato mukhyamantri hai, to aise main unka MLC bananaa tay he
 Apart from this, Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma are deputy cms
 dinesh sharma amit shah or modi ke kareebi or bharosemand maane jate hai
 In such a situation, there was no threat to them
 pichley dinon lakhanu daure par aae party adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha tha ki keshav ji ko upi main majbootee se raajnneeti kerani he
 In such a situation, Keshav Maurya was also in the safe zone
 iske baad sirf do naam bachate hai, swatantradev singh or yogi sarkaar main eklaute muslim cheharaa mohsin raja
 One of them would have to resign as minister
 swatantra dev singh RSS ke becoground or party sanghathan se aate hai
 Not only this, whatever the rally of Narendra Modi in UP, independent Dev has been taking care of them
 aise main unhen bhi kisi tarah kaa koi khatra nahin tha
 Mohsin Raza was among the five ministers of Mohsin Raza's Padayogi government in danger, whose ministers were supposed to be almost fixed
 lekin chunaav ayog ne mangalvaar ko apane faisle ko badalte hue jaiveer sihan kii rikt hui seat par bhi chunaav karaane kii adhisuchana jari kar di he
 It is now clear that the five ministers of the Yogi government are in the safe zone, now no minister will have to give up his chair
 paanch MLC ke istife se rikt hui sitadrasal pichley dinon soobe kepanch MLC ne apane padon se istifadekar bijepi kaa daaman thama he
 These included four sps and one BSP MLC

 In the 2014 general election, BJP won 282 seats out of the total 543 seats in the Lok Sabha
 1951-52 chunaav main congress ne 489 siton main se 364 siton par jeet hasil kii thi or us samay party ke paksh main kareeb 45 fisadi mat pade the 
 Now if we talk about 1957, Nehru was again in the election field
 desh ek kathin daur se guzar rahaa tha kyonki pradhanmantri nehru ko 1955 main hindu vivaah kanoon paas hone ke baad party ke bheetar or baahar dakshinpanthi vichaardhaara se ladanaa pad rahaa tha
 There was also a controversy in the country about various languages
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 1953 main rajya punargathan samiti ke gathan ke baad bhashaayi aadhaar par kai rajyon kaa gathan kiya gaya
 There was a different uproar in the country due to food insecurity
 lekin in saare vipareet halaat ke baavjood nehru ne 1957 ke chunaav main 371 siton ke saath shandaar jeet hasil kii 
 The vote share of the Congress also increased from 45 percent to 47 in 1951-52
 78 fisadi ho gayi
 In 1969, Indira led some senior leaders out of the party, known as the Congress (O), led by Morarji Desai
 isi daur main indira gandhi ne ‘garibi hataao' kaa naaraa diya jisane bhartiya matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse par asar kiya
 As a result, Indira Gandhi won 352 seats in the 1971 general election

 gyaarah may kaa din praudyogiki ke lihaaj se bharat ke liye behad mahatvapurn he
 The second nuclear test at Pokhran was successfully carried out on the same day in 1998
 tabhi se desh main har saal 11 may kaa din rashtriya praudyogiki diwas ke rup main manaaya jane laga
 Technology expert HK Bhagat says that the Pokhran test conducted under the name of 'buddha Smile' definitely shows India's technological capability

 On this day in 1998 Pokhran not only successfully conducted nuclear tests, but the episode started on this day had turned into five nuclear blasts of India by 13 May

 Bhagat said that on 11 May 1998, the US, which had knowledge of every corner of the world with state-of-the-art satellites, had become confused in front of Indian technology
 raksha maamalon ke jaankaar esake suri ke anusaar bharat ne parmaanu shakti banakar ni:andeh duniya main aaj apni dhak jamaa lee he, lekin desh ab bhi kai deshon se kai morche par pichhadaa hua he
 He said that India has today succeeded in developing a missile defense system on its own, but now it will have to work very hard to establish a system like the US
 suri kaa maananaa he ki bharat apane padosi china se raksha morche par kaaphi peeche he or use barabari karne ke liye edi-chotii kaa jor lagane kii jarurat he
 He said that China has developed a 'stealth' aircraft that is not in the grip of radar, which until now was only with the US
 suri ne kaha ki bharat ko yadi badi shakti bananaa he to use dusron se shreshth hathiyaar praudyogiki viksit kerani padegi
 Suri said that India has defeated many big countries in software technology and many other areas, but much attention needs to be paid to defense sector

 Technology giant Apple has recently launched the iphone X, which costs more
 haalanki isaki bikri to bharat main november se shuru hogi
 Its price will start from Rs 89 thousand and the top model is Rs 1 lakh
 agar aapako saste main khareednaa he to ek khushkhabari he
 Because the app has decided to offer an international warranty on the iphone outside the US
 isse pehle tak company america se kharide gaye iphone par international warantee nahin detii thi
 Since iphones are cheap in the US, people were hesitant due to lack of international warranty
 gauratlab he ki company ne iske koi khaas elaan nahin kiya,balki chupake se sirf policy apadet kar di he
 However, this warranty will only be on the unlocked iphone
 america main telecom companiyon ke jariye iphone beche jate hai jo locd hote hai
 Even if you unlock it in India, you will not get warranty in it
 aipal ke mutabik ab america se kharide gaye iphone par ek saal kii interneshal warantee milegi
 Most of Apple's products always have international warranty, but the company kept the iphone out of it
 yani jis desh se kharida sirf vahiin kii warantee milti he
 Pre-orders for the iphone x in India are starting from October 27, but before that such news has come, which will surely please the customers
 ab aapako america main iphone x kii keemat kya he ye bataa den
 The starting price of iphone x is $ 999 i
e
 Rs 65,000 and tax
 bharat main isaki keemat 89 hajaar se shuru he, isliye america main tex mila kar bhi bhartiya keemat se kam main milegaa
 Since international warranty will be got i
e
 it can be made in India also
 philhal company kii taraf se is par koi khaas bayaan jari nahin kiya gaya he
 Slums, that is, slums are not necessarily bad
 ve anivaary avashya hoti hai
 They are essential for the growth and running of the city, so that it can show the city the way of freedom from poverty
 ye bharat ko badalane ke liye anivaary hai
 The matter is complex, but it can be said as such
 sari bahes inke hataae jane ko lekar he taaki shahar sundar dikh sake, jaisaa ki dilli ke yamuna pushte ke saath hua
 Or it is a matter of making the city slum-free, by leasing, improving services and restoring them when needed, as the Rajiv Awas Yojana aims
 inhen hataae jane ke peeche akasar do daleelein di jaati hai
 First, that they are unproductive, their residents do not contribute to society
 duusare, ve rahane laayak nahin hai, yani aise ilaakon main sthit hai jo insaani rihaaish ke liye upyukt nahin, jaise ki nadi ke kinare yaa rail patari par
 Both these arguments have been proved wrong
 jhuggivasi utpaadak kaam karte hai
 By that i do not mean maids, cooks or drivers who make the life of the urban middle class possible
 inaki sankhya to maamuli he
 The 2008–09 report of the National Sample Survey on housing conditions and facilities in India shows that the employment pattern of both slum dwellers and non-slum dwellers is the same
 aise jhuggivasi kam hai jo ity yaa vittiya seva kshetra main kaam karte hon, lekin adhiktar kapadaa kshetra or nirmaan mazdooree main lage hote hai
 Overall, they play a part in the entire landscape of the urban economy
 ho saktaa he ki ve kam kushalta vaale kaamon main lage hon, lekin kai seva kshetra, cells aadi main hai or kuch to profeshnal bhi hai
 The city needs them as much as the city
 jhuggiyaan nahin hongi to ye kaamgaar kahaan rahenge? jhuggiyaan hataane se samooche shahar kii utpaadakta par asar padataa he
 This effect can be so dangerous that the fabric of the city is severely disintegrated
 kya ham jhuggiyon ko durust nahin kar sakate? masalan, jhuggivaasiyon ko kyon na jameen ke patte de die jaaen? iske parinaam ke bare main ek baar sochen
 First of all, there will be a competition between those who consider themselves landowners and tenants
 ek baar jameen kaa malikana haq saaf ho gaya, to shahari log yahaan jaminen kharidne ke liye pahunchenge
 This is because slums in India are located in better areas in cities than elsewhere
 amir shahari logon ke pahunchane se jagah 'sabhy' ho jaaegi or un logon ke rahane laayak nahin rah jaaegi jo pehle se vahaan par the
 Let the lease not be right, why not provide them good services
 iskaa asar dhire-dhire samaan rup se hoga or shahar ke duusare logon main jhuggiyon kii sweekaaryata badhegi
 Some poor slum dwellers will still face difficulties, who live on rent, but this will be acceptable, although the Rajiv Awas Yojana has a leasing provision
 aakhir ko, patte dena ekamusth kaam he jabaki sevaayen dena lambii avadhi kaa kaam
 Therefore, this thing needs to be considered seriously
 ek baat or, sirf yojanakaar hi is vishay main sochen itnaa kaaphi nahin he, shahar ke kathith bhadralok ko apni soch bhi iske hisaab se dhaalni chahie
 However, the status of services in slums is actually improving
 eneses ke aankade dikhaate hai ki nahin rahane laayak ilaakon main bhi pani, swatchta, naalee or kachra ikattha karne kii sevaayen samay ke saath sudhari hai
 Slum dwellers also invest in improving their surroundings
 ye ilaake rahane yogya nahin hai isliye yahaan sevaayen nahin di ja saktin, yah soch hi apane aap main galat sabit ho jaati he
 It is different that some cities will actually have such accommodations
 maujuuda saarvajanik awaasan ke mukaable jhuggiyaan kai maamle main behatar hai
 They are denser, occupy less area, expandable to 225 square feet, are closer to the workplace, have rental facilities, and, from a city perspective, supply from here quickly according to market demand can be done
 bharat philhal aarthik badlaav or shahari uthal-puthal se guzar rahaa he
 The share of cities in GDP is increasing
 aise main jhuggiyaan shahar main aane kaa ek kifayati pravesh dwaar hai jahaan garibi se nikalne kaa ek sambhavit rasta mil jaataa he

 After the national selectors sit down to select the team for the remaining two matches after the second Test match against Australia, Virender Sehwag is likely to have a deep consultation in the name, as this opener will be able to return to form despite constantly getting opportunities
 Has failed apni lachar form ke kaaran sahvaag ek-divasiy team se baahar kar die gaye the, lekin aakraamak tewaron ke kaaran australia ke khilaaf pehle do test maichon ke liye unhen team main barkaraar rakhaa gaya tha
 So far, he has disappointed the selectors, his fans and the team management by scoring 2, 19 and 6 runs in three innings of this series
 sahvaag ke pichley kuch saalon ke aankadon par gaur karne se lagata he ki aage unke liye team main jagah bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The aggressive batsman from Delhi has scored only one century in the last 40 Test innings
 disambar, 2010 ke dakshin africa daure se lekar ab tak unhone 20 test maichon main 28
 He has scored 1036 runs at an average of 77, including a century
 is bich paanch baar vah khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 Sehwag, after battling for successive runs, scored 117 in the first Test match played against England in Ahmedabad, he felt that he had regained his lost form, but he was 18 in the subsequent nine Test innings
 11 kii ausat se 163 ran hi bana paae
 His highest score was 49 runs in these nine innings
 dhoni ne chennai test ke baad kaha tha, main samajhataa hum ki hamen sahvaag ko adhik samay dene kii jarurat he
 He is a player who has his own style of playing
 kai baar ham unki jarurat se zyada aalochana kar lete hai
 We all know that he is a player who can turn the match
 vah aakraamak ballebaaj he or use usee ravaiye ke saath aage badhane den
 The comments bhartiya captain ne jis sahvaag kii baat kii he, vaisaa sahvaag pichley teen saal main kabhi-kabhaar hi dekhne ko mila he
 Looking at the figures, Sehwag completed 7,000 Test runs against Sri Lanka in Colombo in August 2010
 vah is mukaam par sabase kam pariyon main pahunchane vaale duniya ke duusare ballebaaj the, lekin iske baad 45 pariyon main vah 1547 ran hi bana paae hai, jisamen do shatak shaamil hai
 This has also adversely affected their averages
 dilli ke is ballebaaj ne apane pehle 86 test maichon main 54
 He had scored 7,610 runs at an average of 01, but 28 in the last 18 matches
 62 kii ausat se ran bana paae hai or unka overol ausat 50 se neeche aa gaya he
 Sehwag was dropped from the one-day squad due to his poor form, but was retained in the squad for the first two Tests against Australia due to aggressive temper
 abhi tak is shrunkhlaa kii teen pariyon main unhone 2, 19 or 6 ran banaakar chayankartaaon, apane prashansakon or team prabandhan ko niraash hi kiya he
 Looking at the statistics of Sehwag's last few years, it seems that it will not be easy for him to make a place in the team
 dilli ke is aakraamak ballebaaj ne pichhali 40 test pariyon main keval ek shatak lagaaya he
 Since the South African tour of December 2010, he has made 28 of 20 Tests
 77 kii ausat se 1036 ran banaae hai, jisamen ek shatak shaamil he
 Meanwhile, he could not even open an account five times
 lagaataar ranon ke liye jujhane ke baad sahvaag ne jab england ke khilaaf ahmedabad main khele gaye pehle test match main 117 ran banaae, to laga ki unhone apni khoi form hasil kar lee he, lekin iske baad kii nau test pariyon main vah 18
 Only 163 runs at an average of 11

 dekhie kaise karnaa he surya namaskara- The next week of general election results, on May 30, 2019, the country's oldest Congress party issued a two-line press release informing its spokespersons of the decision not to send it to TV channels for a month
 ek maheene kii miyaad ko khatm hue do maheene bitne ko hai par congress kaa ek bhi pravaktaa rashtriya mudde kii kisi tivi bahes main hissaa lene nahin gaya
 When this decision was taken, the Congress President Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post and the party was in a state of uncertainty, but now despite clear leadership position, the Congress remains away from TV debates
 congress iske liye ekatarfa media ko doshi tehraati he
 Congress leaders say, "in total, our 12 crore 16 lakh voters also feel that the party's position is right
" '' saansad or congress ke varisht pravaktaa manish tiwari ne india today se kaha, ''15 lakh vuvarship vaale angreji channel bhi khud ko neshnal kehete hai
 90 percent of the channels are bjp's Propoganda Bhompu, so what is the benefit of sending spokespersons there
 '' tiwari yah bhi kehete hai, ''media ko aatmanirikshan karnaa chahie ki jis kaaran use loktantr kaa chauthaa khambha kaha gaya tha vah us kartavya kaa nirvahan kar rahaa he yaa nahin
 Congress spokesperson Rajiv Tyagi says, "this is a satyagraha of the Congress against the media houses who are serving lies instead of news
" ham satya kii ladaai lard rahe hai, isamen samay lagegaa or ham samay denge
 Truth can be troubling, not defeated
 ''lekin isse congress ko lagaataar nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Due to the absence of official spokespersons of the Congress, according to the convenience in the TV debit, the channel carries someone in the name of a Congress supporter
 sirf bhartiya janata party ke khilaaf bolnaa congress kaa paksh rakhana nahin hota
 Political analyst Abhay Kumar Dubey says, "if the Congress is not sending an official spokesperson, then unauthorized supporters of the party have started coming on TV in the name of different organizations
" lekin unka bolnaa kya congress kaa aadhikarik paksh he, mujhe isamen shaq he
 i think that the Congress should be known to the people in a firm manner which is not going
 ab congress paraajay ke shok se baahar aa gai he or sonia gandhi ke kaman sanbhaalane ke saath party main anischitata bhi khatm ho gai he
 Therefore, the spokespersons should be sent to TV debates
 '' jaahir he, rajnatik ghatnaayen teji se ho rahi hai
 If the Congress does not present its position properly, then the public will not know its side
 yah samvadaheenata party ke liye nuksandeh he
 Are those who take part in TV debates by becoming Congress supporters not harming the Congress? On this, Rajiv Tyagi says that it reflects that even today, when the Congress is in opposition, the work of media houses does not go on without the Congress
 party ke neshnal media koordinator abhaya dube kehete hai, ''hamane channelon ko aagaah bhi kiya he ki congress samarthak ke taur par kisi ko bhi dibet main shaamil nahin karen
 The Congress party can only have an authorized spokesperson of the party
 ''is roak se kya phayda hua? is par tiwari kehete hai, ''sarkaar ke bhompu bane tivi channel logon ke bich amaanya (dilesitmij) hote ja rahe hai

 pehali baar chinna santan ne 22 july, 1991 ko maut ko chakma diya tha
 On 21 May 1991, the Special Investigation Team (SIT), set up to search for the conspirators and their associates for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, came very close to the main conspirators
 radha vinod raju kii aguai main esaity ne chennai ke bahari ilaake main libration tigers of tamil ilam (altitii) se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale pambal ke ghar par dhaava bolaa
 Sri Lankan Tamil Santan, a member of the LTTE intelligence wing present there, woke up and did what the hardline members of the LTTE have been doing at the time of being caught
 usne synid ke capsule ke liye haath badhaayaa, lekin esaity ne us par kaabo paa liya or khudakshi karne se roak diya
 On 18 February this year, Santan and two other convicts Murugan and Perarivalan again dodged the death

 supreme court ne faisle main kaha ki doshiyon ko taumr jail main kaatani hogi, basharte rajya sarkaar unhen maafee na de de
 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa took this opportunity in her hand
 ek din baad hi 19 farvari ko jayalalita ne elaan kiya ki chaar anya doshiyon—robert paayas, jayakumar, ravichandran or nalini ke saath santan, perarivalan or murugan bhi khuli hawa main saans lenge
 These seven convicts have been in jail in Tamil Nadu since 1991
 jayalalita ke is bayaan ke kuch ghanton baad congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apane pita ke hatyaron ke vellore central jail get se baahar nikalne kii sambhaavna par kshobh jataayaa
 He said at a rally in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, "if the prime minister's killers can get away, how can the common man expect justice
" ” agle din pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa bayaan aayaa ki hatyaron ko chhodie kii pahal ''kanoonee taur par jaij nahin” he
 His release was then stayed by the Supreme Court and a notice was issued to the Tamil Nadu government

 The ban on breathing in open air is temporary after the killing of a former head of state by these three members of a banned foreign terrorist organization
 lekin supreme court kaa faisla chaahe jo ho, chunavi varsh main jayalalita ne badhat to le hi lee he
 In any case, Jaya has an edge though Jayalalithaa knows that the Sri Lankan Tamil issue has never been a vote in Tamil Nadu
 srilanka main grih yuddh ke charam dinon may, 2009 main bhi srilankai tamil samarthak guton ke baari virodh ke baavjood jayalalita ke virdohi diemke-congress gathjod ne tamilnadu or pudducheri kii 40 main se 28 siten jeet lee thim

 They have been treating it as a terrorist organization and demanding the Center not to allow its cadres to gain a foothold in India
 ab shaayad unhen lagata he ki tamil bhaavana kuch ubhaar par he, khaskar 2011 main raashtrapati dwaara dayaa yachika khaarij karne ke baad sahanubhuti lahar tej hui he
 So, he tossed a political coin whose victory is in both cases
 agar supreme court rajeev ke hatyaron ko bari karne ke faisle par muhar laga detaa he to unki vijay hogi
 If the adverse verdict of the Supreme Court comes, then their opponent will lose the hand of Karunanidhi

 The conspiracy hatched in the jungle was Rajiv Gandhi's murder of the most painful and disgusting conspiracy of the 20th century
 manmohan singh ne 20 farvari ko ise ''bharat kii aatma par hamalaa” qaraar diya
 For the first time, a human bomb was used to kill an important leader
 isaki sajeesh uttari srilanka main vanni ke ghaney jangalon main altitii supremeo velupillai prabhakaran or uske krur khufia pramukh pottu amman ne disambar, 1990 main rachi
 Its purpose was both to revenge and change the situation
 rajeev sirf isiilie nahin maare gaye kyonki unke pradhanmantri rahete bhartiya shanti sena ne srilanka main jaakar altitii se loha liya tha, balki yah prabal sambhaavna thi ki ve phir pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 Prabhakaran's killer squad was commanded by LTTE insider Kane Sivarasan
 uski madad chennai main altitii kii khufia shakha ke pramukh murugan or duusare jasoos santan ne kii
 These people enlisted the help of several local Tamil supporters — Nalini, Subha and Perarivalan — to execute their deadly plan

 a half kg RDX was tied with thousands of nails in his waist
 dhanu purv pradhanmantri ko maala pahanaakar unke pair chune ke bahaane neeche jhuki or apane belt bam kaa batan dabaa diya
 After that, Rajiv and 17 people were killed in a loud explosion, including nine policemen and six normal people
 bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami kehete hai, ''ye sabhi kattar aatankwaadi hai
 It is absurd to say that the late decision caused him mental injury
 jo log unke dwaara maare gaye, unke adhikaron ke bare main kya kahenge?”sibiai kii esaity ne rajeev gandhi hatyakand main 1994 main aarope-patr daayar kiya or prabhakaran samet 41 logon ko abhiyukt banaaya
 Four years later a TADA court sentenced 26 conspirators to death
 inamen ek bhi sajaa par amal nahin ho paaya
 The case began to grow slowly after 2000 when the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence of just four accused - Santan, Perarivalan, Murugan and his wife Nalini
 uske baad se unki dayaa yachika par taalamatol or raajnneeti shuru ho gai (dekhen: dayaa kii raajnneeti)
 National matter, regional politics Like Jayalalithaa, former Chief Minister M
 karunanidhi bhi dayaa yachikaaon ke sawaal par idhar-udhar karte rahe hai

 ( —saath main kavin malar or e
 Sadasivam) purv cricketer vijay hajaare kisi parichay ke mohataaj nahin hai
 Born on 11 March 1915, Vijay Hazare gave a new identity to Indian cricket in the world
 unhone maharashtra ke liye cricket khelaa or saath hi 1951 se 1953 ke bich 14 maichon main bhartiya cricket team kii kaman bhi sanbhali
 Some interesting things about Vijay Hazare- dilli vidhansabha chunaav us vakt ufaan par pahunch gaya tha, jab bijepi ne aam aadmi party ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar arvind kejariwal kii lokapriyata ko takkar dene ke liye desh kii pehali mahila ipies adhikari raheen kiran bedi ko bijepi main shaamil kar liya
 With this move, a kind of fear was clearly visible in the leaders of Aam Aadmi Party, because before Kiran's arrival, there was a fear of going to BJP, Delhi's largest voter group, ie middle class
 upar se yah khabar bhi chalane lagi ki kiran bedi khud kejariwal ke khilaaf nai dilli se chunaav lard sakati hai
 So, now that New Delhi is full of seats from government employees, ie middle class, so the danger was that Kejriwal himself should not lose the election
 lekin kuch hi din baad somvaar, 19 janvari kii raat 11 baje bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne jis tarah kiran bedi ko dilli kaa mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar or purvi dilli kii krishna nagar seat se ummidavaar banaaya, usase bahut kharaab sandesh gaya
 The message was that when the BJP is contesting elections in other states without putting forward only Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and for Delhi too, it had announced to adopt the same policy, then why the BJP suddenly got the Chief Minister The name of the candidate of the post had to be announced and that too the imported candidate
 
 
 ? The BJP gave a message that it had no leader to contest against Arvind Kejriwal, perhaps by contesting an unknown name like Nupur Sharma from New Delhi seat
 decided to
 bas, yahi dilli chunaav kaa terning point tha, kyonki ek taraf bijepi ne khud apane kamazor hone kaa sandesh diya, or duusari taraf agali hi subah arvind kejariwal ne nai dilli se namakan karne jate samay is chunaav kaa sabase bada rodsho karke apni takat kaa ehsaas kara diya or bas iske baad se aam aadmi party ne jo badhat bijepi par banaai, vah bijepi ke edi-chotii kaa jor lagane ke baad bhi kaayam rahi

 Tata made a business proposal for Air Asia Barhad, a cheap airline from Kuala Lumpur (malaysia)
 air asia hindustan main ek nai airline shuru kar rahi thi or chaahati thi ki tata is company main 30 fisadi yaa 90 lakh dollar (takreeban 63 karod rupye) tak kaa nivesh karen
 a few minutes later, Air Asia chairman Tony Fernandes entered and gave a presentation on how the business would be viable
 baithak khatm hote-hote is airline main nivesh karne kaa faisla le liya gaya
 Also, some conditions were added: Tata Sons' investment in the new company would not exceed $ 9 million, no guarantees would be supported by the Tata Group (so that they would be responsible for the amount of loans taken from banks for the business Cannot be held), and finally that Tata Sons will have the appropriate representation on the board of the new company

 But after the sacking of Cyrus Mistry in October 2016, the peculiar outburst that broke out did not let it remain normal
 mistre ne neshnal company lau tribunel (ensielti) main jo maamla daayar kiyaae usamen aarope lagaaya ki 6 disambar, 2012 ko bulaai gai baithak main tata ne aise halaat paidaa kar die, jinamein chijen pehle hi tay kii ja chuki thim or vahaan maujuud logon ke paas unhen sweekaar karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin tha
 In a time when the industry was in turmoil, questioning the Tata group's decision to enter the airline business, Mistry managed Sir Dorabji Tata Trust in important matters related to Air Asia India (a company formed in June 2014)
 The trustees also raised the issue of interfering with Arankataraman or Venkat even though he was not a member of the board of Tata Sons 
 mistre ne air asia ke saude kaa faisla lene se pehle thik tarikese akalan nahin karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya or air asia india ke prabandhan main visangatiyon ko saamne rakhaa
 Surprising the Tata group, in May this year, the CBI filed a First Information Report (FIR) stating that Fernandes and Tata Sons, through their nominated personalities Venkataraman, had obtained various clearances by lobbying within the government

 Mistry approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the decision of the Mumbai bench

 But the NCLT case and the CBI investigation have brought Uda Tata's new venture into the spotlight

 pro-khalistan Sikh organizations have surprised everyone by giving their support to the Milli Muslim League, the political party of Hafiz Saeed
 mahaj chaar din pehle hi hafiz ke rishtedaar abdul rahamaan makki ne peshawar ke multan main sikh dharm ke sansthaapak guru nanak dev kaa apmaan kiya tha
 But he is forgotten and is seen with Sikh organization Hafiz Saeed
 darasal, bharat ke most wontedatanki hafiz saidke rishtedaar makki ne beeti 26 april ko na keval guru nanak dev par islam ke khilaaf sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya tha, balki unako muslim virdohi bhi bataaya tha
 Despite this, the advocates of Khalistan remained silent and Sikh organizations
 ve makki or hafiz said ke khilaaf ek shabd bhi nahin bol paae
 Surprisingly, ignoring the insult of Guru Nanak Dev, the General Secretary of Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Gopal Singh Chawla not only helped organize the conference of Hafiz Saeed's political party at Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev, It also assured Hafiz that the Sikhs of Pakistan were with him
 'aaj tak' ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik 28 april ko nankana sahib main yojit kii gai rajnatik kanvension main na keval mili muslim lig ke adhyaksh safullah khalid ne bhaag liya, balki hafiz said bhi vahaan par maujuud tha
 The organizers kept Hafiz away from the cameras, but photos of Gopal Singh Chawla and Saifullah are in front of everyone, suggesting that Chawla openly used the religious site to welcome militant Hafiz Saeed
 hafiz said ne apane ek taaja jahrile bhaashan main kaha he ki sikhon kii haalat kisi se chuphi hui nahin he
 Today, they are considered among the most common in the world
 jis samudaay ne kabhi hindustan par raaj kiya
 Today his condition is pathetic and no one is going to ask him
 haalanki haafiz kaa ye bayaan haasyaaspad he kyonki sikh samudaay ne naa keval bharat balki samooche vishvabhar main apni kabaliyat or tarakkee ke jhande gaade hai
 The shameful thing is that Hafiz Saeed's advocates of Bhikhalistan are silent after this poisonous and abusive speech
 hafiz pakistan main khulaa gum rahaa he or sikhon ko lubhaane ke liye sikh bahul ilaakon khaskar lahore or nankana sahib kii yatraaen kar unako bargalane main laga he
 If your phone has been stolen or snatched away from the country's capital Delhi or it has been lost, then you forget that that phone will never come back to you
 aap bhale apane us gum hue phone kii police shikaayat bhi darj kara den, usko sarvelans par bhi lagava den
 Believe that even then your mobile will not be able to reach you back
 dilli main mobile ek do nahin balki darjanon aise gang kaam kar rahe hai, jinke bare main ab ham aapako yahaan jaankaree de rahe hai
 Delhi Police has arrested two youths named Mahatab Malik and Praveen Sharma
 ye donon mahaj 5veen paas hai
 He bought some such devices that used to change your precious mobile phone and its identity
 in divaais ke jariye ye yuvak chori kiye yaa chhine gaye mobile phone kaa sabase pehle lock khol dete the
 After this, the password of Google in your phone was opened
 phir aap ke mobile ke saare data ko clin kar diya jaataa
 After this, the most trusted IMEI number of the mobile was changed
 is divaais kaa naam he(umt)ultimate multiprapaj tuls
 This device is like a dongle through which the pattern lock of the mobile is opened
 saaf shabdon main kahen to aap kaa phone analock kiya jaataa he
 Then VST device, it is also like a pen drive, through which your mobile phone's Google account is opened and all the information and data of the phone is cleaned
 Octopus divaais ke jariye aap ke mobile kaa IMEI number badal diya jaataa he
 Dc Unlocker Ghost device, through which mobile phones are connected to a particular and foreign network and mobile phones whose security features are difficult to break, are also unlocked through this device
 un phone kaa bhi IMEI number badal diya jaataa he
 These two boys, caught in the police, stole hundreds of mobile phones in Delhi through these devices and then with the help of these devices, all the mobile phones were made new and put fake parts in them and ready to be sold back in the market
 sangam vihaar police ne inke kabje se 65 mobile phone or ye tamaam divaais baraamad kiye hai
 The police themselves are assuming that many gangs in Delhi are cleaning their hands on your mobile phone and making it new with these new technology and these devices which are easily available in the market like Delhi's Ghaffar Market
 lekin surakshaegenciyaan inkaa todanheen nikaal paa rahi hai
 This is the reason why your stolen phone is not found despite being on surveillance
 desh kii rajdhani yaa kisi bhi rajya main mobile phone talashne main police isliye phissadi sabit ho rahi he, kyonki churaae gaye mobile phone kaa jab IMEI number badal diya jaataa he or ek hi IMEI ko kai mobile phone kaa IMEI bana diya jaataa he
 So such phones could not be tracked, even if the police recovered the stolen phones from the possession of a gang, it is very difficult to find out who is the real owner of that phone
 yani aap kaa keemtee mobile phone bhale police ke maal khaane main aa bhi jaae, aap usko pahachaanate bhi hai
 But it will be difficult to prove that this phone belongs to you

 The Prime Minister of Pakistan said that he told Nides that at the time when arrangements are being made in the Parliament of Pakistan to increase cooperation with the US, such negative messages will further undermine confidence
 gilaani ne kaha ki unhone is vishay par mukhya vipakshi party piemen (en) ke pramukh navaj sharif se baat kii
 Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar told during the joint session that he also discussed the subject with Nides
 rashtriya essembali or seenet ke sanyukt satr ke dauraan kuch saansdo kii ore se yah vishay uthaaye jane par gilaani pratikriya vyakt kar rahe the
 The lawmakers raised the subject of the announcement of a US $ 10 million reward on Saeed, the founder of lashkar-e-taiba
 unhone kaha ki said ke khilaaf purv main sakshya ke abhaav main maamle ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 Gilani said in Parliament in the evening that he raised the subject during a meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Nides yesterday

 Gilani said he spoke to Nawaz Sharif, the head of the main opposition party PMN (N), on the subject
 videsh mantri hina rabbaani khaar ne sanyukt satr ke dauraan bataaya ki unhone ne bhi nids se is vishay par charchaa kii

 pradhanmantri modi ne shuukravaar ko varanasi main hari jhandi dikhaakar mahaamanaa express ko nai dilli ke liye ravaanaa kiya
 With this, the train with new design, new style and new change coaches was started
 rail mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik, duranto or shatabdi kii tarah mahaamanaa express kii trainon kaa alag class hoga or aane vaale samay main anya railway margon par bhi mahaamanaa express chalaane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Significantly, three days a week, the Mahmana Express, which runs from Varanasi and New Delhi, is the only one of its kind with modern facilities
 bataaya jaataa he ki railway ne philhal nae badlaav ke saath 24 dibbe hi banaae hai, jinamein se 18 dibbon ko varanasi-nai dilli mahaamanaa express main istemaal kiya gaya he
 In the coming days, more coaches will be modified in Bhopal Coach Factory with new look and changes
 jaankaree ke mutabik, jaise-jaise dibbe nai rangath aate jaaenge vaise-vaise nae margon par mahaamanaa express chalaane kaa silsilaa shuru ho jayega
 Railways have a double advantage in running Mahamana Express
 ek taraf jahaan wo issebehatar yatri suvidhaayende paaegi, vahiin duusari taraf wo AC1, AC2 or sleeper ke kiraye main 15 fisadi kii badhotaree bhi vasuul paaegi
 Railway has built a model rack project
 Let us tell you that Indian Railways had built a model rack project with the objective of providing modern and comfortable facilities in all classes of coaches of Mahamana Express
 yah nayaa viksit rack bhartiya rail ko pichley 10-12 varsh se adhik samay se seva pradaan kar rahe saat alag-alag prakaar kii shrenee ke dibbon kaa naveekrut or pun: susajjit rup he

 ‘sanjay dutt phir parole par chute’ ye aisi hedline he, jise loop main lagaakar media vaale bhiaaram se soskate hai
 i believe that if not today, i will leave again after fifteen days
 jab se sanjay dutt ko jail hui wo jail main utane hi din rahe honge jitne din narendra modi pradhanmantri banane ke baad desh main rahe
 Once again, Sanjay Dutt came out on parole and filed for another parole till the end of the parole period
 skool main ‘safaring from fever sins last nite’ vaali arji bhi itani jaldi nahi sweekaar kii jaati, jitani jaldi sanjay dutt kii parole kii arji sweekaar kar lee gai
 Despite this, at the last time he had to go to jail due to dissatisfaction of some people
 sanjay dutt kaa aavedan radd hone kii vajah unhen baar-baar mil rahi beja parole kaa virodh bataaya ja rahaa he, jiske dawaab main unhen chuttee milte-milte rah gai
 This protest is against all those people who are dissatisfied due to not being discharged from the workplace
 insaan apane dukhon se utana dukhi nahin rahata jitna bagal vaale ko buudhvaar ke din outing karte dekh hota he
 Why not provoke dissatisfaction then? What would have happened to those who see Sanjay Dutt being discharged, get the niece to stop for the second time in three months to get a half-day leave
 do din kii chuttee chahie ho to das baras pehle shant hue taoojee kaa uthaavna karwaanaa padataa he
 The relatives of whom ever have to talk on the phone have to take aspirin, their maternal uncle's son has to make an excuse to donate blood
 aise vakt par lagata he sanjay dutt ko to itani aasaani se parole mil rahi he jitani aasaani se pant main rakhi gaadi kii chaabi nahin milti
 In a hurry to go to office, we have to struggle to find a towel for our own bath
 usase bhi kam mehnat main wo jail ke andar-baahar hote rahete hai
 Those who are serving the nation diligently in the rule of thirteen days leave of government job
 unhen rashtravirohi gatividhiyon ke chalate jail gaye sanjay dutt ko family sang pike dekhte dekh aisa lag rahaa tha maanon guruuvar ke vrath ke agle din janmashtami pad gai ho or saamne baith kar koi dahi bade jim rahaa ho
 All these sentences created a wave of dissatisfaction due to which the court had to reject the application of Sanjay Dutt's parole due to the protests
 chalate-chalate obama bharat aa rahe hai
 They will not leave the hotel room due to pollution and protocol
 na khuli hawa main saans lenge na bees minute se zyada ek jagah baithenge

 maujuuda siyaasi shatranj kii bisaat par nirnaayak chaalen chalane vaale mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi aakhirkaar pranab ke naam par apni muhar laga di, jisase congress kii raah aasaan ho gai
 Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, while affirming the statement of party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav about supporting the candidature of Pranab Mukherjee, announced by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), said that Pranab , Is an experienced, qualified, honest, and learned person
 sapa mukhiya mulaayam ne pranab kii ummidavaari par samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ‘raashtrapati pad par pranab mukherjee kii ummidavaari ke samarthan dene ke sambandh main meri raay vahi he, jo party mahasachiv ramgopal kii he
 Pranab is an experienced, qualified, honest and learned person
 ’trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee ke saath do din pehle raashtrapati pad ke liye purv raashtrapati doctor abdul kalam, pradhanmantri manmohan singh tathaa purv loksabhaa adhyaksh somnath chatarji ke naam prastaavit karne ke bare main sawaal hone par mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha, ‘hamane teen naamon kaa suzav diya tha, jise sweekaar nahin kiya gaya

" unhen nahin mana gaya he or pranab mukherjee kaa naam aamtaur par sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Asked if the SP could join the UPA government if the Trinamool Congress leaves the UPA, Yadav questioned it as a useless question, "who has invited us
" ’jab mulaayam se sawaal kiya gaya ki sapa ne pranab mukherjee ke naam par pehle vichaar kyon nahin kiya, to unhone kaha ki unke paas jyotish vidya nahin he
 He said, 'what are you talking about
 hamen kisne (samprag main shaamil hone) bulaayaa he
 Earlier Ramgopal Yadav said in Delhi, 'we support Mukherjee's candidature
 ham unhen samprag kaa ummidavaar banaaye jane par badhai dete hai
 When asked about the reason for supporting Pranab, Mulayam said, "so far we have been supporting Congress and have given it this time too
" aisi baaten karnaa raajnneeti main bekaar hota he
 Events happen in politics and decisions are taken accordingly
 ’yah puche jane par ki kya pranab kii ummidavaari ko samarthan dene ke bare main unki mamata se koi baat hui he, unhone kaha, ‘jab main pranab mukherjee ko samarthan de chukaa hum, to is sawaal kaa koi matlab nahin he
 On the question of BSP chief Mayawati also supporting Pranab's candidature, Yadav said in a terse tone, "you talk about Mulayam Singh

 aarushi or uske parivaar ke gharelu naukar hemraj kaa bilkul sidhaa-sa dikhne vaala doharaa hatyakand is samay kaa sabase rahasyamay maamla kyon he
 The answer to this question is not as mysterious as the statement of the Joint Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, Arun Kumar, who later handled the investigation
 unhone kaha tha ki ghatnasthal par pehle hi saboot nasht kar die gaye the
 The result is that many key evidences, clues, and clues that would have helped investigators identify the real killer were lost forever
 saboot nasht hone dene ke aarope noida police par lage
 Further investigation created a gap due to the destruction of evidence at the scene
 noida police ne hatyakand ke kuch hi ghanton ke baad 15 may, 2008 ko jaanch kaa jimmaa sambhala
 What was his style like for 24 hours? Noida police did not seal the scene
 shuruaati kuch ghanton main yah padosiyon, mitron, parichiton-aparichiton ke yah dekhne ke liye khulaa rahaa ki aakhir kya hua he
 Aarushi's room was soon allowed to be cleaned, destroying many forensic evidence including Aarushi's blood
 finger print nahin liye gaye
 Blood samples were not taken
 betaratib tareeke se postmortem kar diya gaya
 Many important biological evidence were not collected
 yahaan tak ki hatya ke samay ko lekar bhi andeh paidaa ho gaya
 The search dogs were not taken help
 noida police ne in sabhi baton kaa khyal nahin rakhaa
 Just did what the people of the house said
 yahaan tak ki police ne daravaaje par lage khun ke dhabbe or diwaar par haath ke nishaan ko bhi jaanchane kii jarurat nahin mahasoos kii
 Hemraj's body was found a day later when retired police officer KK Gautam was investigating the scene
 tathy yah he ki saakshyon ke liye puure ghar kii bhi talaashi nahin lee gai
 The question remains - did the police commit these mistakes unknowingly or was it deliberately carried out
 in sabake baavjood noida police ne press conference ke dauraan is parivaar ke khilaaf durbhaavnapurna abhiyaan chalaaya
 The police arrested Rajesh Talwar, Aarushi's father, suspecting the family members of involvement in the assassination
 meerut jone ke aiji gurdarshan singh ne bade hi naatakeey andaaj main kahani gadhate hue yah aarope lagaaya ki rajesh talwaar ne hi aarushi or hemraj kii hatya kii, kyonki ye unke vivaahettar sambandhon ke bare main jaan gaye the
 It is said that when Aarushi protested against the father's affair, Hemraj tried to blackmail Talwar
 ghatana ke bare main bataaya gaya ki talwaar ne pehle ghar kii chat par hemraj kii hatya kii, phir neeche aakar nashe kii haalat main aarushi kii hatya kii
 The CBI took over the responsibility of resolving the case in an unreliable manner on 1 June
 ve ab tak banaae gaye li par chalane ko baadhya the
 First, the CBI captured Rajesh Talwar's laptop and Aarushi's desktop for investigation
 prayogshal main le jaakar isse haal hi main mitaai gai samagriyon ko waapas laane kii koshish kii gai
 The CBI also questioned some others, including the Durrani couple, on the basis of suspicion, but no result was found
 rajesh talwaar, compounder krishna, durrani parivaar ke gharelu naukar rajkumaar or pados ke naukar vijay mandal kii kai baar forensik jaanch kii gai
 Rajesh and Nupur were sent for polygraphy test twice and psychoanalysis test once
 saath hi krishna, rajkumaar or mandal ke bhi poligraphy test, brain masping or narco analysis test kiye gaye
 The CBI has not yet clarified why they did not get all such tests of Rajesh and Nupur done
 jaanch ke lagbhag 40 dinon baad sibiai ne yah kaha ki rajesh talwaar kii giraftaar ke vakt noida police ke paas unke khilaaf koi saboot nahin the
 After this, the way of his release was cleared during the third hearing on Talwar's bail
 ab teen maheene baad sibiai chargeshit daakhil karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 On the basis of the scientific evidence on which the CBI gave a clean chit to Rajesh Talwar, she could not recover the weapons used in the murder and mobile phones of Aarushi and Hemraj
 inhen baton ke aadhaar par sibiai ke diaiji niraj gotru ne press conference yojit kar bataaya ki thos sabooton ke abhaav main vah chargeshit daakhil karne kii sthit main nahin he
 This will clear the way for bail to the three main murder accused on September 11
 sabooton kii khoj main sibiai ne hatya main prayukt hathiyaar or mobile phone ke bare main jaankaree dene waalon ke liye ek lakh rupye ke puraskaar kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In this way, the links of this scandal could not be added due to lack of reliable evidence
 hatyakand ke sthaan par shuruaati daur main hi laaparvaahee barti gai
 Many senior officers of Uttar Pradesh Police are happy that CBI has failed to resolve the case, despite all the opportunities
 unhen yah mahasoos karnaa chahie ki yah unki khud kii upeksha kaa nateeja he
 As far as the case is concerned, the situation is still as before
 yah ab tak ansulajhaa he

 uttar pradesh main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko satta ke singhaasana tak pahunchane ke liye party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii shuru kii gai 'khaat sabhaaon' kii nawachaari kavayad charchaa main he, lekin pashchimi madhyapradesh ke adivasee bahul jhabua or alirajpur jilon main siyaasi netaa pichley kai dashakon se aisi sabhaaon ke jariye chunavi bela main duurastha kshetron main janajaatiy samudaay ke matadaataaon tak pahunch banaate aa rahe hai
 In Jhabua and Alirajpur districts, direct communication with tribals sitting on a khat is known as 'khatla meetings'
 bhili boli main khaat ko 'khaatla' kaha jaataa he
 During the elections in both the districts, 'khatla meetings' are an important part of the strategy of political parties, because it is believed that the way to reach the corridors of power, especially through these meetings
 is baat kii taaja misaal yah he ki ratlam-jhabua loksabhaa seat par gat 21 november ko hue up chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa or congress ne adivasee matadaataaon tak pahunchane ke liye aisi saikadon baithken kii thim
 Senior Congress leader Kantilal Bhuria defeated his nearest rival BJP candidate and sitting MLA Nirmala Bhuria by 88,832 votes in the by-election for Lok Sabha seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 yah seat nirmala ke pita or tatkaaleen bhaajapa saansad dilip singh bhuriya ke nidhan se khaali hui thi
 Kantilal's son and his chief electoral strategist Vikrant Bhuria admitted in conversation that a series of 'khatla meetings' played an important role in the Congress' victory in the by-election to the ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha seat
 vikrant ne kaha, 'jhabua or alirajpur jilon main khaatla baithkon kaa prayog bahut purana he
 Through these meetings, we get a chance to have a two-way dialogue with the voters in a kind way, whereas in large gatherings, only one-sided interaction is possible
 khaatla baithkon ke dauraan matadaata siyaasi netaaon ke saamne apni samasyaayein khulkar rakhte hai
 When needed, they do not refrain from telling political leaders properly
 jhabua or alirajpur jilon main 'khaatla baithkon' kii chunavi kavayad ke peeche khaas bhugolic vajah bhi he
 The dispersed population of the tribals in both the districts resides in the 'pods' situated on inaccessible hills and valleys, where it is practically impossible to organize a large gathering at any one place
 aam jubaan main 'faliyon' ko mohalle bhi kaha ja saktaa he, jinamein mahaj 25 se 50 ghar hote hai
 a village is formed of many such beans
 ye faliye paanch kilometre kii duuri main bhi faile ho sakate hai
 The comments jaankaron ke mutabik, jhabua or alirajpur jilon main chunaavon ke vakt bhaajapa or congress main jabardast hode lagi rahati he ki adivaasiyon ke 'faliyon' main koun sa dal sabase pehle or sabase zyada 'khaatla baithken' karata he
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) jhabua or alirajpur jilon main khaat par baithkar adivaasiyon ke saath kiye jane vaale sidhe samvaad ko 'khaatla baithkon' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Khat is called ‘khatla’ in the Bhili dialect
 donon jilon main chunaavon ke vakt 'khaatla baithken' siyaasi dalon kii ranneeti kaa ahm hissaa hoti hai, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki satta ke galiyaaron tak pahunchane kaa rasta khaskar inhen baithkon se hokar gujarata he
 The latest example of this is that during the November 21 by-election in ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha seat, BJP and Congress held hundreds of such meetings to reach out to tribal voters
 anusuchit janajati varg ke liye arakshit loksabhaa seat ke up chunaav main varisht congress netaa kantilal bhuriya ne apni najdiki pratidwandvi bhaajapa ummidavaar va maujuuda vidhayak nirmala bhuriya ko 88,832 maton se haraaya tha
 The seat was vacated by the death of Nirmala's father and then BJP MP Dilip Singh Bhuria
 kantilal ke bete or unke pramukh chunavi ranneetikaar vikrant bhuriya ne baatcheet main mana ki ratlam-jhabua loksabhaa seat par hue up chunaav main congress kii jeet main silsilewar 'khaatla baithkon' kii ahm bhoomika rahi thi
 Vikrant said, 'the use of Khatla meetings in Jhabua and Alirajpur districts is very old
 in baithkon ke jariye hamen matadaataaon ke saath athmiya tareeke se judakar dotarafa baatcheet kaa mauka miltaa he, jabaki badi sabhaaon main unase amuman ekatarfa samvaad hi sambhav ho paata he
 During Khatla meetings, voters openly present their problems to political leaders

 The Parliament on Wednesday approved the bill amid widespread protests in the northeastern states, including Assam, over the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB)
 rajyasabha ne buudhvaar ko vistrut charchaa ke baad is vidheyak ko paarit kar diya
 The House rejected the opposition's proposal and amendments to send the bill to the Select Committee
 vidheyak ke paksh main 125 mat pade jabaki 99sadasyon ne iske khilaaf matdaan kiya
 The Shiv Sena, which had voted in the Lok Sabha in support of the bill, went to the Rajya Sabha by a vote, before Congress President Sonia Gandhi had expressed displeasure over the Sena's stand on the bill
 aise main sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya aane vaale dinon main iskaa asar maharashtra ke gathbandhan par hoga
 On passing the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), Congress President Sonia Gandhi said that it is a dark day for the history of the Indian Constitution
 yah us bharat kii soch ko chunauti he jiske liye raashtra nirmaataa lade
 Turbulent, perverted and divided India will now be formed where religion will be the identity of nationality
 duusari taraf, vidheyak ke sansad main paarit hone ke turant baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ise bharat or iske karunaa tathaa bhaichaare ke mulyon ke liye aitihaasik din qaraar diya
 He tweeted that the bill 'will remove the sufferings of many people who have suffered for years
 'modi ne rajyasabha main vidheyak kaa samarthan karne vaale sabhi sadasyon kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya
 Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is completely in accordance with the constitutional provisions and there is a provision of "not taking citizenship of anyone", so Muslim citizens of the country need not fear it
 bataa den kikaib ko sansad dwaara manjuuri pradaan kiye jane ke bich ise lekar jari virodh pradarshnon ke maddenjar assam ke guwahati main buudhvaar ko anischikaal ke liye karfu laga diya gaya he, jabaki tripura main assam rifles ke javaanon ko tainaat kar diya gaya he
 Similar protests are reported from other states in the Northeast

 To improve the language it is necessary that our vocabulary is right
 is lihaaj se dekhen, to ‘ramcharitamanas’ ekadam bejod sahitya he
 If we look at this composition of Tulsidasji separately from religion, morality, decorum, story, all of this, yet it is the perfect creation for improving and grooming Hindi
 kisi taraf se ekaadh pej padhakar bhi aap ‘baba’ ke bhashaa gyaan se laabh uthaa sakate hai
 This can be better understood by an example
 maan len, kisi bachche ne apana homework puraa karne ke liye aapse ‘samudr’ ke liye kuch payaaryavachi shabd (samaan arth rakhane vaale shabd) puch daale, to aap use kya-kya bataaenge or use yah kis tarah rataayenge? agar aap thodaa vakt nikaalkar maanas ke panne ulat-palat karte rahenge, to shabdon kii kami kabhi paas nahin fatakegi
 Only one couplet in Lanka is not given only one, not two, not five, not seven, ten synonyms
 chunki ye gey (gane yogya) hai, isliye inhen yaad rakhana bhi behad aasaan he
 See that quadruped: 'bandyo bananidhi neeranidhi jaldhi sindhu baris
 satya toynidhi kampati udadhi payodhi nadees
 
 'lankapati ravan ko jab yah khabar mili ki samudr par pul bana diya gaya he, to uske achraj kaa thikaana nahin rahaa
 In this wonder, he started to say with his ten mouths, is the sea really tied? All the words except 'bindyo' and 'truth' in the above couplet have come for the sea itself
 is tarah ab aapke paas samudr ke liye hai itane saare shabd:vananidhi, niranidhi, jaladhi, sindhu, varish, toynidhi, kampati, udadhi, payodhi, nadeesh
 This is just one example
 jyon-jyon aap isamen gote lagaate jaaenge, thodaa or gaharaai main utarane kaa aapkaa utsaah dinondin badhata jayega
 To take full advantage of this treatise, it is necessary that you keep the version of it with you, in which the meanings are given

 sonika singh deth mistry kii puri kahani jaanane ke liye yahaan clic karen The longest-serving president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, has once again been entrusted with the task of taking the party out of crisis
 rahul gandhi ke liye congress kaa sheersh pad swechha se chhodane ke mahaj 20 maheene baad sonia gandhi (72) ko congress kaary samiti (seedblusi) ne shanivaar ko party kaa antarim adhyaksh niyukt kiya
 In fact, Rahul resigned from the post of Congress President on May 25 after a bitter defeat in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 seedblusi ke liye sonia swabhaavik pasand thi, jo pehle bhi sankat kii ghadi main party kii khewanhaar rah chuki hai
 According to political analysts, this development has made it clear from time to time how dependent on the nehru-gandhi family for the Congress leadership
 congress adhyaksh pad par 19 saal tak raheen sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) kii un faislon ko lekar saraahna kii jaati he, jisane party ko lagaataar do aam chunaavon main or kai rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet dilaai
 She was the party's president from 1998 to 2017
 varsh 2004 main unhone party ke chunaav prachaar kaa netritv kiya or use jeet dilaai
 He refused to become Prime Minister and decided to nominate Manmohan Singh to the post
 unke is kadam ko kai log ek raajnneetik ‘masterstroke' ke taur par dekha gaya
 Sources said that Sonia has shown courage by deciding to accept the unanimous request of the CWC to take the leadership of the 134-year-old as she is constantly facing her poor health
 sonia gandhi nipani raajnneetik pari main samprag ke rup main gathbandhan kaa safal prayog kiya
 One of his biggest successes was to form a pre-election alliance to oust the BJP from power in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin, jab 2009 main centre main apane duusare kaarykaal kii shuruuaat main samprag ladkadaa rahaa tha, tab sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) ne gathbandhan kii naav paar lagaai
 However, he is often criticized for running a cabinet parallel to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ab, ek baar phir se party ke khewanhaar ke taur par aise samay main unki vaapasi hui he, jab is saal ke aakhir main haryana,jharkhand or maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hona he
 Party leaders hope that their leadership will bring new life to the party workers
 yah bhi mahasoos kiya ja rahaa ki sonia kii vaapasi bante hue vipaksh ko bhaajapa kaa muqabla karne ke liye ekajute hone kii ek vajah degi
 This is exactly how things started to change after Sonia Gandhi took over the reins of the party in early 1998
 vah 1997 main party kii praathmik sadsy bani thi or 1998 main isaki adhyaksh baniin
 He is a frequent Lok Sabha member since 1999

 Kapil Mishra, a former minister in the Delhi government and rebel leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has now targeted AAP leader Kumar Vishwas after Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain
 kapil ne ravivaar ko kumaar vishwaas ke ghar jaakar unase mulaakaat karne kii koshish kii or daawa kiya ki vah satyendra jain ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke saboot kumaar ko dena chaahate hai
 However, when Kapil went to Mishra Vishwas's house, he was at a family function in Bareilly during that time and Kapil Mishra was not allowed to come to the house because he was not present at home
 kumaar vishwaas se kapil mishra kii mulaakaat to nahin hui lekin unhone twitor par kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf kai twit kar daale
 In which Kapil wrote, 'kahan ho bhaiya has come to your house, all are old companions
 daravaaje bhi band kyon? shila, aseem or satyendra ke liye alag-alag kanoon?'twit ke kaaphi der baad tak jawaab naa milane ke baad kapil mishra ne phir se twit karte hue likhaa '2 baje tak intjaar karuunga, yah darwaja bhi aise band hoga jaise sonia or shila kaa band hota tha ye nahin sochaa tha? ghar ke andar to aane do
 Despite Kapil Mishra's repeated tweet, when Kumar Vishwas did not respond to him, Kapil came back again and wrote a fierce attack on Vishwas and wrote, "brother, i wish you should come back to the core principles yourself first
" dil se dua or intjaar us din kaa'
 On June 10, Kumar Vishwas said during a conversation with Rajasthan workers to prepare for the election that the Aam Aadmi Party will return to its core principles in the Rajasthan assembly elections
 kumaar ke isi bayaan ko nishaanaa banaakar kapil mishra ne khud unase hi pehle mul siddhanton par waapas aa jane ko kaha
 Kapil Mishra, after posting one after the other on social media, summoned other top party leaders and mlas, including Kumar, on corruption charges
 lekin party ke kisi bade netaa yaa vidhayak ne unhen tavajjon nahin dikhaa
 After this, Kapil Mishra wrote on Twitter again, 'corruption of Satyendra Jain has made Paramon a weapon
 India Against Corruption ke saathi ab netaaon, vidhayakon se milakar saboot denge
 The public should know who gives proof of honesty to Satyendra even after seeing all the evidence
 koun jaanakar chup, koun anjaane main
 Right from the day of his removal from the Delhi government, Kapil Mishra has been continuously accusing Satyendar Jain and then the head of the party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, one after the other
 itnaa hi nahin ravivaar kii shaam ko arvind kejariwal ke google hangout par kaaryakartaaon se ho rahe samvaad par bhi kapil mishra ne hamalaa karte hue kaha ki kejariwal is puure sambhag main sirf aap apni baat kah rahe hai or kaaryakartaaon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de rahe hai

 Now, in the changed situation after Alok Verma was sent on leave, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court claiming that his complaint did not get an FIR, because there was a lot of pressure on the CBI, due to which the agency did not discharge its obligation impartially

 As Devendra Fadnavis is entering the final stages of his 4,232-km Mahajandesh Yatra across the state, there are enough indications that he has come a long way in his political journey
 ab ve sankochi rajnatik nausikhue nahin rahe, jinhone 2014 main (sharad pavaar ke baad) rajya ke sabase yuva mukhyamantri ke taur par kaman sanbhali thi
 Today in 2019, Fadnavis is seen moving with full domination; There is confidence in his words and actions; a politician who has shown that he has the ability to take on top-notch opponents like Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Uddhav Thackeray of the Shiv Sena
 paanch saal pehle rajya bhaajapa ke ekanath khadse, prakaash mehta, girish bapat, rawasaheb daanve or vinod taavade sareekhe varisht netaa fadavis ko junior maanakar bartaav karte the
 Today, there is no doubt who is deciding the direction of the party
 fadavis ko party adhyaksh tathaa kendriya grih mantri amit shah ke saath hi saath pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa vishwaas bhi hasil he
 They have openly expressed their faith in him
 shah ne unki yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi, jabaki modi iske samaapan par unke saath honge
 Shah announced on September 1 that Fadnavis would continue to be the chief minister even after the elections
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav ko jab ek maheenaa baaki rah gaya he, fadavis jaanate hai ki ve or bhaajapa rajya main isse majboot paaydaan par pehle kabhi nahin the
 The massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections in May has only increased the party's prospects
 congress ke safaaye or uske baad rahul gandhi ke party adhyaksh pad se istife ke natijatan machi afra-tafari se rajya ikai bhauchak or pareshaan he
 Pawar's family quarrel is also benefiting the BJP
 congress or ensipi ke kam se kam 20 sheersh netaa pichley kuch maheenon main paala badalakar bijepi or sena main aa chuke hai
 The mentor of the veterans, Sharad Pawar, did not miss any opportunity to degrade him by citing Fadnavis's caste
 fadavis ne 2017 main jab chhatrapati shivaji ke vanshaj sambhaji raaje ko rajyasabha main manonith karne ke liye pradhanmantri modi ko raji kar liya tha, tab pavaar ne kaha tha, ''pehle chhatrapati (maratha) peshwa (brahman) ko niyukt kiya karata tha
 Now Peshwa has appointed Chhatrapati
 '' fadavis kaa pratishodh ab is tarah puraa ho rahaa he ki apane bacchon ko lekar pavaar or unke bhaaiyon kii takaraati mahatvakankshaayen khule main aa gai hai
 Pawar's brother and powerful media industrialist Abhijeet is actually said to be close to Fadnavis
 fadavis kii duusari uplabdhi yah he ki unhone shivasena or uske netaa uddhav thakare ko sarkaar ke khilaaf khuleam bayaanbaji karne ke baavjood apni taraf banaae rakhaa he
 He had understood that Uddhav would have to win in ways other than politics
 lihaaja fadavis khud apni taraf se aae din sena pramukh se milane chale jate or raajnneeti ke saath-saath gaiyr-rajnatik muddon par unase charchaa karte the
 Once, he took his wife Amrita along and the Thackeray family hosted a dinner for the Phadavis couple
 yahaan tak ki us raat vahaan parosi gai machhlee or zinga khaane kii vajah se jab unki tabiyat bighad gai tab bhi unhone ek shabd nahin kaha
 It was Fadnavis who persuaded both the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav and Shah to fight the elections together despite the mutual war between the two parties
 fadavis kehete hai, ''hindutv hamaara saajha aadhaar he
 i do not want to let him weaken
 '' is had tak ki rajnatik paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki uddhav bhaajapa kii shart par gathbandhan main bane rahane ko raji ho jaaenge
 Fadnavis arrived as a serious politician in crisis in late 2017 when the BJP under him secured power in 60 per cent of local bodies
 unki saakh tab or bad gai jab unhone mukhyamantri ke taur par apane kaarykaal ke dauraan teen bade sankaton ko kushalta se sambhala
 When the successive states were announcing debt waivers, Fadnavis did not initially want to put such a heavy burden on the state exchequer
 aakhir main unhone kisaanon ke 1
 Announced the loan waiver of up to Rs 5 lakh, but cleverly kept government employees, politicians and income tax payers out of it
 saath hi, karj maafee ko aadhaar se jodgaye ke unke faisle ne farji khaaton kii pahchaan main madad kii
 Therefore, the number of beneficiaries of debt waiver has come down from 89 lakhs to 52 lakhs directly and the total amount of loan waiver has come down from Rs 32,000 crores to 21,000 crores directly
 unka aglaa bada imtihaan tab hua jab 2018 main koregaanv-bhima kii hinsa ke baad dalit samudaay main virodh kaa ufaan aa gaya
 Fadnavis was under tremendous pressure to arrest Sambhaji Bhide, the leader of Hindutva and the alleged perpetrator of the riots
 magar ant main ise maovadiyon kii sajeesh qaraar diya gaya or paanch activist—varvara raav, sudhaa bharadwaj, varnan gonsalveej, arun farera or gautam navalkha—ko maovadiyon ke saath jude hone ke andeh main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But it did not end here
 is prasang kaa nateeja rajya main bi
 R
 ambedkar ke pote prakaash ambedkar kii aguai main ek tisare morche—vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie)—ke udai main hua
 Finally, Fadnavis took over his political ironie with the Maratha community's demand for reservation
 unhone samaj liya ki alpsankhyak brahman hone ke naate ve maratha samudaay ke andolan kaa nishaanaa ban sakate hai or tab is aag ko bujhane ke liye unhone nirnaayak kadam uthaae
 He reconstituted the defunct Maharashtra Backward Commission, which ultimately re-assessed the social and economic backwardness of the Maratha community at 32 per cent of the state's population
 isi se is saal june main maratha samudaay ke liye shiksha main 13 fisad or sarkari naukariyon main 12 fisad aarakshan kaa rasta saaf hua
 Fadnavis also announced the construction of hostels for Maratha students and the return of 50 per cent of their fees
 yahi vajah he ki kamjor vipaksh kisi bhi mudde par fadavis ko gherne main naakaam rahaa, baavjood iske ki kisaanon kii karj maafee kii rakam chukaane or kanoon-vyavastha banaae rakhane main deree hui
 They even failed to corner any minister, while some ministers had allegations of corruption
 aane vaale chunaav main ummid he ki bhaajapa vidhansabha kii kul 288 main se 120 siten shivasena ko degi or khud 150 par apane ummidavaar utaaregi
 The remaining 18 seats will be given to smaller parties like Republican Party of India, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha and Shiv Sangram
 congress or ensipi 125-125 siton par chunaav ladgaye or baaki 38 siten choti partiyon ke liye chhodie par raji ho gai hai
 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Raj Thackeray was also part of this alliance, but the Enforcement Directorate's investigation against him in the alleged money laundering case of Rs 78 crore has thrown him out of the race
 ho saktaa he ki electronic voting mashin ko lekar apane virodh ke bahaane emenes chunaav main hi na utre
 Seeing the opposition on such a weak wicket, Fadnavis could not stop himself from saying in Nanded, "the next leader of the opposition will be from VBA
" ''shaayad na bhi ho
 The scale of the VBA alliance was shattered on 6 September when coalition partner All India ittehadul-e-muslimeen withdrew from the Dalit Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh due to differences in seat sharing
 is gathbandhan ne loksabhaa chunaav main 14 fisad vot hasil karke or congress-ensipi ke 10 ummidavaaron kii haar main yogadan dekar ek kism kii sansani machaa di thi
 His split has now increased the confidence of the BJP
 bhaajapa ke rajya adhyaksh chandrakant patil kehete hai, ''pehle hamane 220 siton kaa lakshya tay kiya tha
 Now we can win up to 250
 '' aise main nateezon kaa besabri se intjaar rahegaa
 *** shahid ko jab bhi film 'haidar' kii shooting se fursat milti he, vah turant apane living room pahunch jate hai
 Behind this is a new hobby of Shahid
 shahid ne acting or daancing ke boote apni pahchaan banaai
 But now he is also fond of becoming a disco jockey
 yahi nahin, vah is shauk ko bhi profeshanali bhi puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 So, as time goes on, he starts to clean his hands on the DJ console
 pichley saal ek party main shahid ne deje system ke peeche apane kadam rakhe or ban gaye the deje
 Throughout the night, he kept discovering his talent and also entertained the people well
 phir ek silsilaa hi chal padaa
 In the last few days, Shahid Jin used to be a DJ there even when he used to go to close friends parties
 ab to un par aisa junun savaar ho gaya he ki khud ke liye deje kaa puraa consol kharid liya he
 Shahid has kept his DJ console in the living room of the house
 har roj vah alag-alag prayog or mixing karne kii koshish main lage rahete hai
 The essence of this new hobby is that whenever there is a chance, people are locked away from the world in their rooms
 shahid 'deje shoej' main kaise feet honge iske liye to aapako intjaar karnaa hoga
 But till then listen to one of his songs, which has a special mention of 'DJ'
 uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main ravivaar ko bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii baithak hui
 Many big changes were made in this meeting about the party
 isamen bispi supremeo mayawati ne party upaadhyaksh pad apane bhai anand kumaar ko diya he
 While Mayawati had earlier removed Anand Kumar from the post of party vice president, but now once again she has given the number 2 position in the party to her brother
 saath hi is baithak main unhone samaajawaadee party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 According to information received from sources, Mayawati spoke for about 25 minutes in this meeting
 unhone kaha ki espi ke log ye kah rahe hai ki unki badaulat bispi 10 siten jiti he to wo log apane girebaan main jhanke
 The truth is that if SP could win even 5 seats, it is only because BSP supported him
 upachunaav main hamen ye dikhaanaa he ki ye jeet hamaari akele kii jeet he jiskaa credit espi ke log le rahe hai
 SP has cheated, Akhilesh has done nothing
 Mayawati said that sp's people cheated in the election, in many places, SP leaders were defeated by SP leaders
 dharmik dhruvikaran ko lekar samaajawaadee party kaaphi dari hui thi isliye wo khulkar muddon ko uthaane se kataraati rahi
 Mayawati praised senior party leader Satish Chandra Mishra and said that those who are complaining about it should know that Satish Chandra Mishra stood with the party and me in difficult times
 mayawati ne puraane vakt ko bhi yaad kiya or kaha ki mere upar darj keson main samaajawaadee party ke netaaon kaa bada haath rahaa he
 Apart from this, Mayawati accused the SP of campaigning against the BSP in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh se kai baar shikaayat kii magar bhitarghaat hota rahaa
 Akhilesh did not take any action on his people
 nattejey aane ke baad bhi sampark kiya magar akhilesh ne koi baat nahin kii
 i should have told them where your people did not cooperate
 akhilesh ne phone tak nahin kiya- mayawatikhilesh yadav par kadaa prahaar karte hue mivati ne kaha ki gathbandhan ke chunaav haarane ke baad akhilesh ne mujhe koi phone nahin kiya
 While Satish Chandra Mishra called him to talk to me, he did not make any contact despite this
 baithak main aage bolte hue mivati ne kaha ki maine bade hone kaa ferj nibhaayaa or counting ke din unhen phone kar parivaar ke haarane par afsos bhi jataayaa
 On June 3, when there was talk of breaking the alliance in Delhi meeting, he called Mishraji but did not talk to me
 unhone mujhe massej bhijwaya ki main musalamaanon ko zyada tikat na duun, isse dharmik dhruvikaran hoga, lekin maine unki baat nahin maani
 Mayawati said that there was injustice to the non-yadav backwards under Akhilesh's rule, so she did not vote for the alliance
 samaajawaadee party ne daliton ke pramotion kaa virodh kiya tha isliye unhone hamaara virodh kiya
 The state president of BSP got the sp's senior leader got him to transfer his vote to BJP instead of BSP
 abhi bispi kisi mudde par koi dharna-pradarshan nahin karegi
 India may have given africa main twanti-20 vishwa cap jeeta ho or haal main teen test maichon kii shrinkhalaa bhi baraabar karne main safal rahaa ho lekin jab baat vanade cricket kii aati he to team india ke paas mejabaan team kaa koi jawaab nahin he
