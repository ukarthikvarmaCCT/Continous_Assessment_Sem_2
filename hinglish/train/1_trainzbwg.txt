 There are 4 countries involved in cooperation on the QUAD maritime border and China considers it a major threat to itself
 isse pehle vaarta kaa pehla daur november 2017 main china ke chengdu ke mishaan main yojit kiya gaya tha

 a recent survey suggests that men lie more than women
 iske nattejey mahilaon kii shaq karne kii aadat ko saport karte hai
 After all, when she will not get a clear answer on anything, she will always look at her partner with suspicion
 haalanki jhooth kaisaa he or kis vajah se bolaa ja rahaa he, yah vyakti vishesh par nirbhar karata he
 But it can not be denied that while some lies bring sweetness to the relationship, some also break the relationship
 mard kai baar apane parter ko khush karne ke liye jhooth bolte hai, jise galat nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is a way of expressing love but sometimes men resort to lies to hide their shortcomings and mistakes which cannot be accepted in any form
 aamtaur par mardon ke jhooth kaaman hote hai or ye hai unke kaaman jhooth ke kuch behtareen udhaaharan:1
 i am not staring at her, despite walking tirah or staring at a beautiful girl in the restaurant, men do not accept this
 ve kabhi bhiye sweekaar nahin karte ki aapke hote hue usne kisi or ko dekha
 Even if their eyes are not diverting from that other girl or woman, but they will refuse it on your request

 i have stopped smoking cigarettes
 When you get an empty packet of cigarettes from your husband or boyfriend's bag or pocket while cleaning, never ask them the reason for its emptying
 cigarette ke khaali packet ko lekar mard aksar jhooth bolte hai
 He never believes that he has finished all the packets of cigarettes
 bhale hi aapako unke kapade or haathon se cigarette kii gandh aa rahi ho lekin ve hameshaa yahi kahenge ki unhone subah se ek hi cigarette pi he
 3
 main tumhaare alaava kisi se sambandh banane kii nahin sochtaais mudde par mard aksar jhooth bolte hai
 Even if they have not thought about having an integration with anyone other than you, there is definitely something in their fantasy
 modells or heroinon ko lekar lagbhag har mard phantsi paalataa he lekin poochne par jhooth hi bolta he
 4
 main tumhaare bina ek din se zyada nahin rah saktaagar aap shaadishuda he to yah baat sunne kii aadi hongi
 Whenever you are going to go to a maternal uncle, your husband will say something similar to you
 lekin asal baat kuch or hi hoti he
 Most men want his wife to stay away from home for a few days so that he can live his bachelor's life
 5
 i was not sleeping, thinking that whenever you would catch your husband or boyfriend sleeping during the day or evening, he would give the same answer that he did not sleep but he was thinking something
 jabaki sach yah he ki vah vaaki maje kii neend le rahe the or is maamle main jhooth bolnaa unki sabase puraani aadat he
 Google has today recalled Greek professor Michael Dertouzos on his 82nd birthday through his doodle

 Also, between 1974 and 2001, he also held the post of MIT Laboratory of Computer Science Director
 jaane- google ne kyon khaas tareeke se banaaya tha mahadevi verma par doodlelogon ke liye jaruri hoga internetmical dartojas ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki duniya main internet kii suvidha laana behad jaruri he
 He had told how the Internet would play an important role in people's lives and would be useful for the people everyday
 aap sabko pataa hi he ki hamaara tivi biimaar ho gaya he
 TV has become TB all over the world

 i am not calling myself a doctor by calling someone sick

 The poison inside him is not reaching from within us

 i am very sick myself meraa tivi bhi biimaar he
 In the name of debate, this noisy noise brings light or darkness to your eyes
 aap shaayad sochate to honge
 Debate determines accountability
 lekin javabdehi ke naam par ab nishandehi ho rahi he
 Is being targeted is dibet kaa aagaman hua tha muddon par samaj saaf karne ke liye
 But the debate soon became a game of death for public opinion
 janamat ek mat kaa naam nahin he
 There are many opinions in public opinion
 magar yah dibet tivi janamat kii verieti ko maar rahaa he
 One has started establishing the rule of public opinion
 jin ankaron or pravaktaaon kii abhivyakti kii koi seemaa nahin he wo is azaadi kii seemaa tay karnaa chaahate hai
 Many times you should ask this question to yourself and what we are showing and why you see
 aap kahenge aap jo dikhaate hai ham dekhte hai or ham kehete hai aap jo dekhte hai wo ham dikhaate hai
 If someone is number one in this, then someone is like me
 koi top he to koi mere jaisaa fail
 If TRP is our destination, then why are you its partner
 kya tiarapy aapaki bhi manzil he
 So we want to take you to that dark world of TV where you can hear that noise alone
 samaj saken
 To live up to his hopes and fears, which we produce everyday of anchors
 aap is cheekh ko pahachaaniye
 Understand this outcry
 isliye main aapako andhere main le aayaa hum
 There is no technical fault
 aapkaa signal bilkul thik he
 This darkness is the picture of today's TV
 hamane jaanboojh kar ye andhera kiya he
 Understand that the lighting of your drawing room is extinguished and i am only talking to you in that seclusion of darkness
 mujhe pataa he aaj ke baad bhi main vahi karuunga jo kar rahaa hum
 Nothing will change, nor can i change
 main yani ham ankar
 One among all anchors
 ham ankar chillane lage hai
 Threatens
 jab ham bolte hai to hamaari nason main koon daudane lagata he
 Looking at us, the blood of your veins is getting hot
 dharanaon ke bich jang he
 Notifications are nowhere
 hai bhi to bahut kam hai
 Our job is to help you think differently
 jo satta main he usase sabase adhik sakht sawaal poochna he
 Our job is not to shout
 fatkaarna nahin he
 Do not abuse uksaana nahin he
 Do not bully
 poochna he
 The end is to ask for the end
 is prakriya main ham kai baar galatiyaan kar jate hai
 You forgive
 lekin kai baar aisa lagata he ki ham galatiyaan nahin kar rahe hai
 We are doing this deliberately
 isliye ham aapako is andheri duniya main le aae hai
 You listen to our voice
 hamaare poochne ke tareekon main fark kiijie
 Who is not upset and desperate
 sabake bheetar kii hataasha ko ham hawa dene lage to aapke bheetar bhi garam aandhi chalane lagegi
 Which will burn you one day too
 jeenyu kii ghatana ko jis tarah se tivi channelon main cover kiya gaya he use aap apane apane dal kii pasand kii hisaab se mat dekhiye
 Look at it according to the society and the process of balanced understanding
 kya aap ghar main isi tarah se chilla kar apni patni se baat karte hai
 Does your father scream at your mother in the same way
 kya aapane apni bahanon par isi tarah se chikha he
 Why is it that anchors scream exactly like this
 pravaktaa bhi ankaron kii tarah dhamka rahe hai
 The question is left somewhere
 jawaab kii kisi ko parvaah nahin hoti
 Beat beat, hold Hold sounds
 ek do baar main bhi gussaya hum
 Scream and scream raat bhar neend nahin ai
 Tense eyes tightened
 aksar sochataa hum ki hamaari birdari ke log kaise cheekh lete hai
 Let's shout
 agar cheekhney chillane se javabdehi tay hoti to rose pradhanmantri ko cheekhnaa chahie
 The army chief should come on TV and scream
 har kisi ko har kisi par cheekhnaa chahie
 Will we allow TV so much that they start threatening us instead of telling us
 hamamen se kuch ko chhaant kar bheed banane lage or us bheed ko lalkaarane lage ki jaao use khinch kar maar do
 He is a traitor
 deshadrohi he
 What is the anchor jo bheed ko uksaata ho, bheed banaata ho wo kya he
 The demand for screaming anchors is increasing all over the world
 aapako lagata he ki aapke badale cheekh kar wo thik kar rahaa he
 Actually he is not doing well
 kai pravaktaa gaali dete hai
 Let's talk about killing
 goli maar dene kii baat karte hai
 They do this so that you get scared
 aap bina sawaal kiye unase sahamat ho jaaen
 Our TV has started working now
 ankar rose bhaashan jhaad rahe hai
 Like i am brushing today
 wo deshbhakti ke pravaktaa ho gaye hai
 Everything is being seen through the spectacles of patriotism and betrayal
 sainikon kii shahadat kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he
 In the name of his sacrifice, no one is being made a traitor
 isi desh main jantar mantar par sainikon ke kapade faad diye gaye
 His medals were drawn
 un sainikon main bhi koi yuddh main ghayal he
 Someone has lost part of their body
 koun jaataa he unke aansu ponchney
 Martyrdom is supreme but is the political use of martyrdom also supreme
 kashmir main rozaana bharat virdohi naare lagate hai
 In today's Indian Express, a police officer has said that if we start arresting everyday, then we will arrest many
 bataanaa chahie ki kashmir main pichley ek saal main pidipi bijepi sarkaar ne kya bharat virdohi naare lagane waalon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Yes, what is their number
 vahaan to aae din koi pakistan ke jhande dikhaa detaa he, koi aatankwaadi sanghathan aies ke bhi
 What does the Kashmir problem have to do with Muslims living in other parts of India
 koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The problem of Kashmir is not the problem of Islam
 kashmir kii samasya kii apni jatilta he
 It should be left to the governments
 pidipi afzal guru ko shahid maanati he
 The PDP has not yet said that Afzal Guru is what the BJP says, that is, terrorist
 iske baad bhi bijepi pidipi ko apni sarkaar kaa mukhiya chunati he
 It is also sad that this best political experiment is being called inferior in the name of calling some students in JNU as terrorists
 bijepi ne kashmir main jo kiya wo ek shandaar raajnneetik prayog he
 History will give Prime Minister Modi a good place for this
 haa uske liye bijepi ne apane raajnneetik siddhanton ko kuch samay ke liye choda use lekar sawaal hote rahenge
 If Afzal Guru is a terrorist in JNU then what is there in Srinagar
 in sab jatil masalon ko ham haa yaa naa ki shakl main bahes karenge to tarksheel samaaj nahin rah jaaenge
 Will remain as a crowd
 yah loktantr ke liye acha nahin he
 However, now in the world of channels every rule has become serialized
 pehle hamen sikhaaya gaya tha ki jo bhadakaane kii baat kare, uksaane kii baat kare, saamaajik dwesh kii baat kare uskaa bayaan na dikhaanaa he na chhapana he
 What will we do now when anchors are talking like this? pravaktaaon ko kuch bhi bolne kii chhot de rahe hai
 The video of Kanhaiya's speech was played by the channels in a dangerous manner
 bina jaanch kiye ki koun sa video sahi use chalaaya gaya
 Now TV Today and ABP channel have reported that the videos are fake
 kuch videon main kaant chhaant he to kisi main upar se naaron ko thopa gaya he
 If there is such a difference in the video then it is a matter of investigation
 iske pehle tak kaise ham sabko nattejey par pahunchane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 In Gali Gali, slogans were raised in protest against JNU
 chaatro ko aatankwaadi or deshadrohi kaha gaya
 Will any channel take accountability of those videos now? kya ab ham ankar utane hi ghante cheekh cheekh kar bataayenge ki video sahi nahin the
 Were disputed
 kisi main kanhaiya garibi se, samantvaad se azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he to kisi ne yah kaat kar dikhaaya ki wo sirf azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he
 So, how is it supposed to talk about freedom that he is talking about independence from India
 hamaare sahyogi manish aaj kanhaiya ke ghar gaye the
 There is such a poor family that they do not have the capacity to give tea to journalists
 unhen mushkil main dekh manish kumaar waapas chale gaye
 If a student leader who suffers this poverty will not talk about freedom from poverty then will our politicians sitting in the lap of industrialists
 tippaniyan Kanhaiya Kumar's photographs were swapped so that people could see him as a terrorist and a traitor
 ek tasviir main wo bhaashan de rahaa he to usee tasviir main peeche bharat kaa kataa chanta jhanda jod diya gaya he
 Photoshop technology nowadays does a lot
 yah kitna khataranaak he
 Who were giving this air on social media by creating a group
 koun log saboot or gavaahi se pehle omar kalid ko aatankwaadi gaddaar bataane lage
 He also should not have run away
 saamne aakar bataanaa chahie tha ki usne kya bhaashan diya or kyon diya
 This is the difference between Kanhaiya and Khalid, but perhaps the way the crowd is lenient towards Kanhaiya, Khalid does not get this exemption
 phir bhi agar kalid ne aisa kuch kaha to use saamana karnaa chahie tha
 The situation is that posters have been put in place to show Khalid a terrorist
 ab agar uskaa video farzi nikal gaya to kya hoga
 Should the video not be awaited verification
 isiilie hamane aaj is screen ko kaala kar diya he
 We will give you different kinds of voice today
 ho saktaa he aapmen se kuch log channel badal kar chale jaayenge
 It is also possible that some of you will listen to the voices that have been inside you from end to end
 pehle ham aapako alag alag channelon ke studio main jo baaten kahin gayi wo sunaanaa chaahate hai
 i am not interested in name and identity because i may have done so
 aisa mujhase bhi ho jaae
 The way journalists and spokespersons have attacked anchors is no less terrible
 kahin patrkaar dhaava bol rahe the, kahin pravaktaa
 But the definition of traitors in the name of patriotism that journalists have set is very dangerous
 meraa makasad sirf aapako sachet karnaa he
 You listen gaur se suniye
 Feel when you listen to them
 kab aap uttejit ho jate hai
 Also note that no facts have been proved so far
 jaisaa ki do channelon ne bataaya he ki video ke kai sanskaran hai
 Therefore, no conclusion can be reached immediately on the basis of this
 aapke screen par yah andhera patrakarita kaa pashchaatap he
 Which includes all of us
 ham phir se bataa den ki aap mujhe dekh nahin paa rahe hai
 There is no technical fault
 ye awaz aapke zahan tak pahunchane kii koshish bhar he

 kaise bolte hai or bolne se kya hota he

 hamamen se kuch ko chhaant kar bheed banane lage or us bheed ko lalkaarane lage ki jaao use khinch kar maar do
 He is a traitor
 deshadrohi he
 What is the anchor jo bheed ko uksaata ho, bheed banaata ho wo kya he
 The demand for screaming anchors is increasing all over the world
 aapako lagata he ki aapke badale cheekh kar wo thik kar rahaa he
 Actually he is not doing well
 kai pravaktaa gaali dete hai
 Let's talk about killing
 goli maar dene kii baat karte hai
 They do this so that you get scared
 aap bina sawaal kiye unase sahamat ho jaaen
 Our TV has started working now
 ankar rose bhaashan jhaad rahe hai
 Like i am brushing today
 wo deshbhakti ke pravaktaa ho gaye hai
 Everything is being seen through the spectacles of patriotism and betrayal
 sainikon kii shahadat kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he
 In the name of his sacrifice, no one is being made a traitor
 isi desh main jantar mantar par sainikon ke kapade faad diye gaye
 His medals were drawn
 un sainikon main bhi koi yuddh main ghayal he
 Someone has lost part of their body
 koun jaataa he unke aansu ponchney
 Martyrdom is supreme but is the political use of martyrdom also supreme
 kashmir main rozaana bharat virdohi naare lagate hai
 In today's Indian Express, a police officer has said that if we start arresting everyday, then we will arrest many
 bataanaa chahie ki kashmir main pichley ek saal main pidipi bijepi sarkaar ne kya bharat virdohi naare lagane waalon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Yes, what is their number
 vahaan to aae din koi pakistan ke jhande dikhaa detaa he, koi aatankwaadi sanghathan aies ke bhi
 What does the Kashmir problem have to do with Muslims living in other parts of India
 koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The problem of Kashmir is not the problem of Islam
 kashmir kii samasya kii apni jatilta he
 It should be left to the governments
 pidipi afzal guru ko shahid maanati he
 The PDP has not yet said that Afzal Guru is what the BJP says, that is, terrorist
 iske baad bhi bijepi pidipi ko apni sarkaar kaa mukhiya chunati he
 It is also sad that this best political experiment is being called inferior in the name of calling some students in JNU as terrorists
 bijepi ne kashmir main jo kiya wo ek shandaar raajnneetik prayog he
 History will give Prime Minister Modi a good place for this
 haa uske liye bijepi ne apane raajnneetik siddhanton ko kuch samay ke liye choda use lekar sawaal hote rahenge
 If Afzal Guru is a terrorist in JNU then what is there in Srinagar
 in sab jatil masalon ko ham haa yaa naa ki shakl main bahes karenge to tarksheel samaaj nahin rah jaaenge
 Will remain as a crowd
 yah loktantr ke liye acha nahin he
 However, now in the world of channels every rule has become serialized
 pehle hamen sikhaaya gaya tha ki jo bhadakaane kii baat kare, uksaane kii baat kare, saamaajik dwesh kii baat kare uskaa bayaan na dikhaanaa he na chhapana he
 What will we do now when anchors are talking like this? pravaktaaon ko kuch bhi bolne kii chhot de rahe hai
 The video of Kanhaiya's speech was played by the channels in a dangerous manner
 bina jaanch kiye ki koun sa video sahi use chalaaya gaya
 Now TV Today and ABP channel have reported that the videos are fake
 kuch videon main kaant chhaant he to kisi main upar se naaron ko thopa gaya he
 If there is such a difference in the video then it is a matter of investigation
 iske pehle tak kaise ham sabko nattejey par pahunchane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya
 In Gali Gali, slogans were raised in protest against JNU
 chaatro ko aatankwaadi or deshadrohi kaha gaya
 Will any channel take accountability of those videos now? kya ab ham ankar utane hi ghante cheekh cheekh kar bataayenge ki video sahi nahin the
 Were disputed
 kisi main kanhaiya garibi se, samantvaad se azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he to kisi ne yah kaat kar dikhaaya ki wo sirf azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he
 So, how is it supposed to talk about freedom that he is talking about independence from India
 hamaare sahyogi manish aaj kanhaiya ke ghar gaye the
 There is such a poor family that they do not have the capacity to give tea to journalists
 unhen mushkil main dekh manish kumaar waapas chale gaye
 If a student leader who suffers this poverty will not talk about freedom from poverty then will our politicians sitting in the lap of industrialists
 tippaniyan Kanhaiya Kumar's photographs were swapped so that people could see him as a terrorist and a traitor
 ek tasviir main wo bhaashan de rahaa he to usee tasviir main peeche bharat kaa kataa chanta jhanda jod diya gaya he
 Photoshop technology nowadays does a lot
 yah kitna khataranaak he
 Who were giving this air on social media by creating a group
 koun log saboot or gavaahi se pehle omar kalid ko aatankwaadi gaddaar bataane lage
 He also should not have run away
 saamne aakar bataanaa chahie tha ki usne kya bhaashan diya or kyon diya
 This is the difference between Kanhaiya and Khalid, but perhaps the way the crowd is lenient towards Kanhaiya, Khalid does not get this exemption
 phir bhi agar kalid ne aisa kuch kaha to use saamana karnaa chahie tha
 The situation is that posters have been put in place to show Khalid a terrorist
 ab agar uskaa video farzi nikal gaya to kya hoga
 Should the video not be awaited verification
 isiilie hamane aaj is screen ko kaala kar diya he
 We will give you different kinds of voice today
 ho saktaa he aapmen se kuch log channel badal kar chale jaayenge
 It is also possible that some of you will listen to the voices that have been inside you from end to end
 pehle ham aapako alag alag channelon ke studio main jo baaten kahin gayi wo sunaanaa chaahate hai
 i am not interested in name and identity because i may have done so
 aisa mujhase bhi ho jaae
 The way journalists and spokespersons have attacked anchors is no less terrible
 kahin patrkaar dhaava bol rahe the, kahin pravaktaa
 But the definition of traitors in the name of patriotism that journalists have set is very dangerous
 meraa makasad sirf aapako sachet karnaa he
 You listen gaur se suniye
 Feel when you listen to them
 kab aap uttejit ho jate hai
 Also note that no facts have been proved so far
 jaisaa ki do channelon ne bataaya he ki video ke kai sanskaran hai
 Therefore, no conclusion can be reached immediately on the basis of this
 aapke screen par yah andhera patrakarita kaa pashchaatap he
 Which includes all of us
 ham phir se bataa den ki aap mujhe dekh nahin paa rahe hai
 There is no technical fault
 ye awaz aapke zahan tak pahunchane kii koshish bhar he
 That we can hear what we speak
 kaise bolte hai or bolne se kya hota he
 You recognize this scream
 is chillaahat ko samajhiye
 That's why i brought you into the dark
 koi takniki karaabi nahin he
 Your signal is perfectly fine
 ye andhera hi aaj ke tivi kii tasviir he
 We have deliberately darkened it
 samajhiye aapke drawing room kii batti buja di he or main andhere ke us ekant main sirf aapse baat kar rahaa hum
 i know that even after today i will do what i am doing
 kuch nahin badalegaa, na main badal saktaa hum
 i mean we anchor
 tamaam ankaron main ek main
 We are shouting anchors
 dhamkaane lage hai
 When we speak, blood starts running in our veins
 hamen dekhte dekhte aapaki raghon kaa koon garam hone laga he
 There is a war between perceptions
 suchanaaen kahin nahin hai
 There are also very few
 hamaara kaam tarah tarah se sochane main aapaki madad karnaa he
 Whoever is in power has to ask the most rigorous question
 hamaara kaam lalkaarna nahin he
 Do not reprimand
 dutkaarna nahin he
 Do not provoke
 dhamkaana nahin he
 Have to ask
 ant ant tak poochna he
 In this process, we often make mistakes
 aap maaf bhi kar dete hai
 But sometimes it seems that we are not making mistakes
 ham jaanboojh kar aisa kar rahe hai
 Therefore, we have brought you into this dark world
 aap hamaari awaz ko suniye
 Differentiate our asking methods
 pareshaan or hataash koun nahin he
 If we start giving vent to the frustration within everyone, then a warm thunderstorm will start inside you
 jo ek din aapako bhi jala degi
 The way the JNU incident has been covered in TV channels, do not watch it according to the choice of your party
 use aap samaaj or santulit samaj kii prakriya ke hisaab se dekhiye
 Do you shout in the house and talk to your wife
 kya aapke pita isi tarah se aapaki maa par cheekhte hai
 Have you shouted at your sisters in a similar way
 aisa kyon hai ki ankaron kaa cheekhnaa bilkul aisa hi lagata he
 Spokespersons are also threatening like anchors
 sawaal kahin chhot jaataa he
 Nobody cares about the answer
 maaro maaro, pakado pakado kii awaz aane lagati he
 i have also been angry once or twice
 chikha hum or chillaaya hum
 Did not sleep overnight
 tanaav se ankhen tani rahi
 i often wonder how the people of our community scream
 chilla lete hai
 If accountability was fixed by shouting, then every day the Prime Minister should scream
 rose senadhyaksh ko tivi par aakar cheekhnaa chahie
 Everyone should scream at everyone
 kya tivi ko ham itani chhot denge ki wo hamen bataane kii jagah dhamkaane lage
 Some of us started to make a crowd, and began to challenge that crowd to go and kill him
 wo gaddaar he
 Is a traitor ankar kya he
 What makes a crowd what makes a crowd
 puri duniya main cheekhney vaale ankaron kii puch badhati ja rahi he
 You think he is doing alright by screaming for you
 darasal wo thik nahin kar rahaa he
 Many spokespersons abuse
 maar dene kii baat karte hai
 Talk of being shot
 ye isliye karte hai ki aap dar jaaen
 You agree with them without question
 hamaara tivi ab aae din karne laga he
 Anchors are debating speeches daily
 jaise main aaj jhaad rahaa hum
 He has become a spokesman for patriotism
 har baat ko deshbhakti or gaddari ke chashme se dekha ja rahaa he
 The martyrdom of soldiers is being used politically
 unke balidaan ke naam par kisi ko bhi gaddaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 In this country, soldiers' clothes were torn off at Jantar Mantar
 unke medal khinche gaye
 Some of those soldiers are also injured in the war
 kisi ne apane sharir kaa hissaa ganvaaya he
 Who goes to wipe their tears
 shahadat sarvocch he lekin kya shahadat kaa raajnneetik istemaal bhi sarvocch he
 anti-india slogans are raised daily in Kashmir
 aaj ke indian express main kisi police adhikari ne kaha he ki ham rose giraftaar karne lagen to kitnon ko giraftaar karenge
 Should be told that in the last one year, the PDP BJP government in Kashmir has arrested those who raised anti-india slogans
 haa to unki sankhya kya he
 Somebody shows the flag of Pakistan, some terrorist organization is also there
 kashmir kii samasya kaa bharat ke anya hisson main rah rahe musalamaanon se kya lenaa dena he
 Has nothing to do
 kashmir kii samasya islam kii samasya nahin he
 The problem of Kashmir has its own complexity
 use sarkaron par chhod dena chahie
 PDP considers Afzal Guru a martyr
 pidipi ne abhi tak nahin kaha ki afzal guru vahi he jo bijepi kahati he yani aatankwaadi he
 Even after this, the BJP elects the PDP as the head of its government
 yah bhi dukhad he ki is behtareen raajnneetik prayog ko jeenyu main kuch chaatro ko aatankwaadi bataane ke naam par kamatar bataaya ja rahaa he
 What BJP did in Kashmir is a brilliant political experiment
 itihaas pradhanmantri modi ko iske liye acchhee jagah degaa
 Yes, for that BJP left its political principles for some time, there will be questions about it
 afzal guru agar jeenyu main aatankwaadi he to srinagar main kya he
 If we debate all these complex issues yes or no, then there will be no rational society
 ek bheed ban kar rah jaaenge
 This is not good for democracy
 baharhaal ab jab channelon kii duniya main har niyam dharashaayi ho gaye hai
 Earlier we were taught that the statement of anyone who talks about provoking, provoking, social malice is not to be shown or printed
 ab kya karenge jab ankar hi is tarah kii baat kar rahe hai
 Letting the spokesmen speak anything
 kanhaiya ke bhaashan ke video ko channelon ne khatarnaak tareeke se chalaaya
 Without checking which video was played correctly
 ab tivi today or abeepi channel ne bataaya he ki video farzi hai
 In some videos, there is a thorn, then in some, slogans are imposed from above
 agar video main itnaa antar he to yah jaanch kaa vishay he
 Before that, how were we all forced to reach the conclusion
 gali gali main jeenyu ke virodh main naare lagaae gaye
 The students were called terrorists and traitors
 kya ab koi channel un video kii javabdehi legaa
 Will we now let the anchor scream for the same hour that the videos were not right
 vivaadit the
 In some, Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from poverty, feudalism and some people cut it off that he is only talking about freedom
 to kya azaadi kii baat karnaa kaise maan liya gaya ki wo bharat se azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he
 Our colleague Manish went to Kanhaiya's house today
 itnaa garib parivaar he ki unke paas patrakaron ko chaay pilaane kii haisiyat nahin he
 Seeing him in trouble, Manish Kumar went back
 is garibi ko jhelane vaala koi chaatr netaa agar garibi se azaadi kii baat nahin karegaa to kya udyogpatiyon kii god main baithe hamaare rajaneta karenge
 The comments kanhaiya kumaar kii tasveeron ko badal-badal kar chalaaya gaya taaki log use ek aatankwaadi or gaddaar ke rup main dekh saken
 In one picture, he is giving a speech, in the same picture, the truncated flag of India has been added
 photoshop takanic se aajkal khub hota he
 This is so dangerous
 soshal media par koun log samooh banaakar ise hawa de rahe the
 Who started calling Omar Khalid a terrorist traitor before evidence and testimony
 use bhi bhaagna nahin chahie tha
 Should have come out and tell what speech he gave and why
 kanhaiya or kalid main yahi antar he par shaayad jis tarah se bheed kanhaiya ke prati udaar he kalid ko yah chhot nahin milti
 Still, if Khalid said something like this, he should have faced it
 haalat yah he ki khalid ko aatankwaadi bataane ke poster jagah jagah laga diye gaye hai
 Now what if his video is fake? kya video ke satyaapan kaa intazaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 That is why we have blackened this screen today
 ham aaj aapako tarah tarah kii awaz sunaayenge
 Maybe some of you will change the channel
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki aapmen se kuch log ant ant tak un awaazon ko sunenge jo hafte se aapke bheetar ghar kar gai he
 First we want to tell you the things that have gone somewhere in the studios of different channels
 naam or pahchaan main meri dilchaspee nahin he kyonki ho saktaa he aisa maine bhi kiya ho
 May it happen to me as well
 patrkaar to patrkaar, pravaktaaon ne jis tarah ankaron par dhaava bolaa he wo bhi kam bhayanak nahin he
 Somewhere the journalists were attacking, somewhere the spokesperson
 lekin patrakaron ne deshbhakti ke naam par gaddaaron kii jo paribhaasha tay kii he wo behad khatarnaak he
 My purpose is just to warn you
 aap suniye
 Listen carefully mahasoos kiijie ki inhen sunate hue aapkaa koon kab kulataa he
 When do you get excited yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki abhi tak koi bhi tathy sabit nahin hua he
 As stated by the two channels there are several versions of the video
 isliye iske aadhaar par turant koi nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 This dark journalism on your screen is remorse
 jisamen ham sab shaamil he
 Let us tell you again that you are not able to see me
 koi takniki kharabi nahin he
 This voice is just an attempt to reach your mind
 ki ham sun saken ki ham kya bolte hai
 How to speak and what happens by speaking
 hamaara kaam tarah tarah se sochane main aapaki madad karnaa he

 How to speak and what happens by speaking
 jeenyu kii ghatana ko jis tarah se tivi channelon main cover kiya gaya he use aap apane apane dal kii pasand kii hisaab se mat dekhiye
 Look at it according to the society and the process of balanced understanding
 kya aap ghar main isi tarah se chilla kar apni patni se baat karte hai
 Does your father scream at your mother in the same way
 kya aapane apni bahanon par isi tarah se chikha he
 Why is it that anchors scream exactly like this
 pravaktaa bhi ankaron kii tarah dhamka rahe hai
 The question is left somewhere
 jawaab kii kisi ko parvaah nahin hoti
 Beat beat, hold Hold sounds
 ek do baar main bhi gussaya hum
 Scream and scream raat bhar neend nahin ai
 Tense eyes tightened
 aksar sochataa hum ki hamaari birdari ke log kaise cheekh lete hai
 Let's shout
 agar cheekhney chillane se javabdehi tay hoti to rose pradhanmantri ko cheekhnaa chahie
 The army chief should come on TV and scream
 har kisi ko har kisi par cheekhnaa chahie
 Will we allow TV so much that they start threatening us instead of telling us
 hamamen se kuch ko chhaant kar bheed banane lage or us bheed ko lalkaarane lage ki jaao use khinch kar maar do
 He is a traitor
 deshadrohi he
 What is the anchor jo bheed ko uksaata ho, bheed banaata ho wo kya he
 The demand for screaming anchors is increasing all over the world
 aapako lagata he ki aapke badale cheekh kar wo thik kar rahaa he
 Actually he is not doing well
 kai pravaktaa gaali dete hai
 Let's talk about killing
 goli maar dene kii baat karte hai
 They do this so that you get scared
 aap bina sawaal kiye unase sahamat ho jaaen
 Our TV has started working now
 ankar rose bhaashan jhaad rahe hai
 Like i am brushing today
 wo deshbhakti ke pravaktaa ho gaye hai
 Everything is being seen through the spectacles of patriotism and betrayal
 sainikon kii shahadat kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he
 In the name of his sacrifice, no one is being made a traitor
 isi desh main jantar mantar par sainikon ke kapade faad diye gaye
 His medals were drawn
 un sainikon main bhi koi yuddh main ghayal he
 Someone has lost part of their body
 koun jaataa he unke aansu ponchney
 Martyrdom is supreme but is the political use of martyrdom also supreme
 kashmir main rozaana bharat virdohi naare lagate hai
 In today's Indian Express, a police officer has said that if we start arresting everyday, then we will arrest many

 Yes, what is their number
 vahaan to aae din koi pakistan ke jhande dikhaa detaa he, koi aatankwaadi sanghathan aies ke bhi
 What does the Kashmir problem have to do with Muslims living in other parts of India
 koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The problem of Kashmir is not the problem of Islam
 kashmir kii samasya kii apni jatilta he
 It should be left to the governments
 pidipi afzal guru ko shahid maanati he
 The PDP has not yet said that Afzal Guru is what the BJP says, that is, terrorist
 iske baad bhi bijepi pidipi ko apni sarkaar kaa mukhiya chunati he
 It is also sad that this best political experiment is being called inferior in the name of calling some students in JNU as terrorists
 bijepi ne kashmir main jo kiya wo ek shandaar raajnneetik prayog he
 History will give Prime Minister Modi a good place for this
 haa uske liye bijepi ne apane raajnneetik siddhanton ko kuch samay ke liye choda use lekar sawaal hote rahenge
 If Afzal Guru is a terrorist in JNU then what is there in Srinagar
 in sab jatil masalon ko ham haa yaa naa ki shakl main bahes karenge to tarksheel samaaj nahin rah jaaenge
 Will remain as a crowd
 yah loktantr ke liye acha nahin he

 Will any channel take accountability of those videos now? kya ab ham ankar utane hi ghante cheekh cheekh kar bataayenge ki video sahi nahin the
 Were disputed
 kisi main kanhaiya garibi se, samantvaad se azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he to kisi ne yah kaat kar dikhaaya ki wo sirf azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he
 So, how is it supposed to talk about freedom that he is talking about independence from India
 hamaare sahyogi manish aaj kanhaiya ke ghar gaye the
 There is such a poor family that they do not have the capacity to give tea to journalists
 unhen mushkil main dekh manish kumaar waapas chale gaye
 If a student leader who suffers this poverty will not talk about freedom from poverty then will our politicians sitting in the lap of industrialists
 tippaniyan Kanhaiya Kumar's photographs were swapped so that people could see him as a terrorist and a traitor
 ek tasviir main wo bhaashan de rahaa he to usee tasviir main peeche bharat kaa kataa chanta jhanda jod diya gaya he
 Photoshop technology nowadays does a lot
 yah kitna khataranaak he
 Who were giving this air on social media by creating a group
 koun log saboot or gavaahi se pehle omar kalid ko aatankwaadi gaddaar bataane lage
 He also should not have run away
 saamne aakar bataanaa chahie tha ki usne kya bhaashan diya or kyon diya
 This is the difference between Kanhaiya and Khalid, but perhaps the way the crowd is lenient towards Kanhaiya, Khalid does not get this exemption
 phir bhi agar kalid ne aisa kuch kaha to use saamana karnaa chahie tha
 The situation is that posters have been put in place to show Khalid a terrorist
 ab agar uskaa video farzi nikal gaya to kya hoga
 Should the video not be awaited verification
 isiilie hamane aaj is screen ko kaala kar diya he
 We will give you different kinds of voice today
 ho saktaa he aapmen se kuch log channel badal kar chale jaayenge
 It is also possible that some of you will listen to the voices that have been inside you from end to end
 pehle ham aapako alag alag channelon ke studio main jo baaten kahin gayi wo sunaanaa chaahate hai
 i am not interested in name and identity because i may have done so
 aisa mujhase bhi ho jaae
 The way journalists and spokespersons have attacked anchors is no less terrible
 kahin patrkaar dhaava bol rahe the, kahin pravaktaa
 But the definition of traitors in the name of patriotism that journalists have set is very dangerous
 meraa makasad sirf aapako sachet karnaa he
 You listen gaur se suniye
 Feel when you listen to them
 kab aap uttejit ho jate hai
 Also note that no facts have been proved so far
 jaisaa ki do channelon ne bataaya he ki video ke kai sanskaran hai
 Therefore, no conclusion can be reached immediately on the basis of this
 aapke screen par yah andhera patrakarita kaa pashchaatap he
 Which includes all of us
 ham phir se bataa den ki aap mujhe dekh nahin paa rahe hai
 There is no technical fault
 ye awaz aapke zahan tak pahunchane kii koshish bhar he
 That we can hear what we speak
 kaise bolte hai or bolne se kya hota he
 Many spokespersons abuse
 maar dene kii baat karte hai
 Talk of being shot
 ye isliye karte hai ki aap dar jaaen
 You agree with them without question
 hamaara tivi ab aae din karne laga he
 Anchors are debating speeches daily
 jaise main aaj jhaad rahaa hum
 He has become a spokesman for patriotism
 har baat ko deshbhakti or gaddari ke chashme se dekha ja rahaa he
 The martyrdom of soldiers is being used politically
 unke balidaan ke naam par kisi ko bhi gaddaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 In this country, soldiers' clothes were torn off at Jantar Mantar
 unke medal khinche gaye
 Some of those soldiers are also injured in the war
 kisi ne apane sharir kaa hissaa ganvaaya he
 Who goes to wipe their tears
 shahadat sarvocch he lekin kya shahadat kaa raajnneetik istemaal bhi sarvocch he
 anti-india slogans are raised daily in Kashmir
 aaj ke indian express main kisi police adhikari ne kaha he ki ham rose giraftaar karne lagen to kitnon ko giraftaar karenge
 Should be told that in the last one year, the PDP BJP government in Kashmir has arrested those who raised anti-india slogans
 haa to unki sankhya kya he
 Somebody shows the flag of Pakistan, some terrorist organization is also there
 kashmir kii samasya kaa bharat ke anya hisson main rah rahe musalamaanon se kya lenaa dena he
 Has nothing to do
 kashmir kii samasya islam kii samasya nahin he
 The problem of Kashmir has its own complexity
 use sarkaron par chhod dena chahie
 PDP considers Afzal Guru a martyr
 pidipi ne abhi tak nahin kaha ki afzal guru vahi he jo bijepi kahati he yani aatankwaadi he
 Even after this, the BJP elects the PDP as the head of its government
 yah bhi dukhad he ki is behtareen raajnneetik prayog ko jeenyu main kuch chaatro ko aatankwaadi bataane ke naam par kamatar bataaya ja rahaa he
 What BJP did in Kashmir is a brilliant political experiment
 itihaas pradhanmantri modi ko iske liye acchhee jagah degaa
 Yes, for that BJP left its political principles for some time, there will be questions about it
 afzal guru agar jeenyu main aatankwaadi he to srinagar main kya he
 If we debate all these complex issues yes or no, then there will be no rational society
 ek bheed ban kar rah jaaenge
 This is not good for democracy
 baharhaal ab jab channelon kii duniya main har niyam dharashaayi ho gaye hai
 Earlier we were taught that the statement of anyone who talks about provoking, provoking, social malice is not to be shown or printed
 ab kya karenge jab ankar hi is tarah kii baat kar rahe hai
 Letting the spokesmen speak anything
 kanhaiya ke bhaashan ke video ko channelon ne khatarnaak tareeke se chalaaya
 Without checking which video was played correctly
 ab tivi today or abeepi channel ne bataaya he ki video farzi hai
 In some videos, there is a thorn, then in some, slogans are imposed from above
 agar video main itnaa antar he to yah jaanch kaa vishay he
 Before that, how were we all forced to reach the conclusion
 gali gali main jeenyu ke virodh main naare lagaae gaye
 The students were called terrorists and traitors
 kya ab koi channel un video kii javabdehi legaa
 Will we now let the anchor scream for the same hour that the videos were not right
 vivaadit the
 In some, Kanhaiya is talking about freedom from poverty, feudalism and some people cut it off that he is only talking about freedom
 to kya azaadi kii baat karnaa kaise maan liya gaya ki wo bharat se azaadi kii baat kar rahaa he
 Our colleague Manish went to Kanhaiya's house today
 itnaa garib parivaar he ki unke paas patrakaron ko chaay pilaane kii haisiyat nahin he
 Seeing him in trouble, Manish Kumar went back
 is garibi ko jhelane vaala koi chaatr netaa agar garibi se azaadi kii baat nahin karegaa to kya udyogpatiyon kii god main baithe hamaare rajaneta karenge
 The comments kanhaiya kumaar kii tasveeron ko badal-badal kar chalaaya gaya taaki log use ek aatankwaadi or gaddaar ke rup main dekh saken
 In one picture, he is giving a speech, in the same picture, the truncated flag of India has been added
 photoshop takanic se aajkal khub hota he
 This is so dangerous
 soshal media par koun log samooh banaakar ise hawa de rahe the
 Who started calling Omar Khalid a terrorist traitor before evidence and testimony
 use bhi bhaagna nahin chahie tha
 Should have come out and tell what speech he gave and why
 kanhaiya or kalid main yahi antar he par shaayad jis tarah se bheed kanhaiya ke prati udaar he kalid ko yah chhot nahin milti
 Still, if Khalid said something like this, he should have faced it
 haalat yah he ki khalid ko aatankwaadi bataane ke poster jagah jagah laga diye gaye hai
 Now what if his video is fake? kya video ke satyaapan kaa intazaar nahin kiya janaa chahie
 That is why we have blackened this screen today
 ham aaj aapako tarah tarah kii awaz sunaayenge
 Maybe some of you will change the channel
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki aapmen se kuch log ant ant tak un awaazon ko sunenge jo hafte se aapke bheetar ghar kar gai he
 First we want to tell you the things that have gone somewhere in the studios of different channels
 naam or pahchaan main meri dilchaspee nahin he kyonki ho saktaa he aisa maine bhi kiya ho
 May it happen to me as well
 patrkaar to patrkaar, pravaktaaon ne jis tarah ankaron par dhaava bolaa he wo bhi kam bhayanak nahin he
 Somewhere the journalists were attacking, somewhere the spokesperson
 lekin patrakaron ne deshbhakti ke naam par gaddaaron kii jo paribhaasha tay kii he wo behad khatarnaak he
 My purpose is just to warn you
 aap suniye
 Listen carefully mahasoos kiijie ki inhen sunate hue aapkaa koon kab kulataa he
 When do you get excited yah bhi dhyaan rakhiye ki abhi tak koi bhi tathy sabit nahin hua he
 As stated by the two channels there are several versions of the video
 isliye iske aadhaar par turant koi nishkarsh par nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa
 This dark journalism on your screen is remorse
 jisamen ham sab shaamil he
 Let us tell you again that you are not able to see me
 koi takniki kharabi nahin he
 This voice is just an attempt to reach your mind
 ki ham sun saken ki ham kya bolte hai
 How to speak and what happens by speaking

 dilli ke water tanker ghotaale main purv siem shila dikshit ke saath kejariwal ke khilaaf bhi exiaar darj kii gai he
 The FIR was lodged on the complaint of Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta
 beete dinon sadan main siem ke 'moonch mundwane' ke bayaan par vijendra gupta ne palatwaar kiya he
 It was Kejriwal's turn to shave the mustache
 In fact, on the same issue in the assembly, CM Kejriwal challenged the leader of the opposition to shave his mustache
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki agar unhone shila dikshit ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii to vijendra gupta apni moonch mundava lenge
 Reacting to this, Vijender Gupta said on Tuesday, 'now it is Kejriwal's turn to shave the mustache
 aaj main kah saktaa hum ki agar us din vidhansabha main teble par na chadhataa to tanker ghotaale main FIR na hoti
 "kejriwal hid corruption" He said that it was necessary to make Kejriwal an accused in the tanker scam, because corruption was not only hidden but even today the same companies are being paid
 ab shila or kejariwal donon jail jaaenge
 The BJP leader said that Kejriwal not only used our laughter to hide the scam, but also used abusive words against my wife
 saamne nahin aa rahe kejarivalvijendra gupta ne kaha, 'exiaar darj hone ke baad kejariwal kyon chhip rahe hai? wo har samay twit karne or media se baat karne ke liye jane jate hai

 unhone kaha ki kejariwal and company ne jhuthe vaade kar dilliwaalon ko bevakoof banaaya
 Kejriwal should resign
 unhen jail honi chahie
 India is currently the largest market in the world in terms of arms procurement
 lekin haal hi main ai ek report main kaha gaya he ki manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main modi sarkaar ke mukaable zyada kharide gaye
 The Modi government showed little skepticism in purchasing arms
 pichley paanch saal ke dauraan hathiyaaron kii vaishvik kharid main bharat kaa hissaa 12 fisadi he
 These data were confirmed by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (sipri)
 saath hi unhone apni report main kaha, 'bharat hathiyaaron kii apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye utpaadan karne main khud sakasham nahin he
 Recently, Sipri released a report stating that India's imports increased by 24 per cent during the last five years 2013-17 as compared to the five-year period of 2008-12
 sipari ke varisht shodhakarta simon vijiman ne likhaa he, 'ek taraf pakistan or duusari tarafchinke saath tanaavon main rahane ke kaaran bharat main pramukh hathiyaaron kii maang bad gai he, jiskaa vah khud utpaadan karne main sakasham nahin he'
 Writing further, he said that, unlike China, China is capable of meeting its own arms needs
 sipari ke aankadon ke mutabik bharat kaa kul rujhaan-sanketak mulya (tiivi) 2008-12 ke dauraan 14,608 tha jo saal 2013-17 main badhkar 18,048 ho gaya
 Let me tell you, during the Congress government in the year 2011-13 when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister
 us samay bharat ne 13,319 tiivi mulya ke hathiyaaron kaa aayaat kiya tha
 But in the year 2015-17, under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP government, only 9,499 TIV worth of weapons were purchased
 lekin saal 2014 ke dauraan jab donon hi netaa satta main the us vakt 3,227 tiivi mulya ke hathiyaar kharide gaye the
 Arms purchases by India, however, have come down during the last three years of the BJP government compared to the last three years of the Congress-led UPA government
 bharat kii paraspar tulana main pakistan kaa hathiyaar aayaat pichley paanch saal ke dauraan lagaatar gata he
 Pakistan's imports from the US have steadily decreased compared to the last five years, while its supply from China has increased
 shodh report main kaha gaya he ki america se pakistan kaa hathiyaar aayaat saal 2008-12 ke mukaable haal ke paanch varsho main 76 fisadi gata he
 Therefore, despite the ongoing tensions with India and the ongoing internal conflict, Pakistan's arms imports declined by 36 per cent in 2013-17 compared to 2008-12
 bataa den, 'saal 2013-17 main vaishvik hathiyaar aayaat main pakistan kaa hissaa 2
 8 per cent '
 sipari ne apni report main bharat ke saath-saath pakistan or bangladesh ke bare main bhi bataaya ki china pakistan kaa saal 2013-17 main hathiyaaron kaa mukhya strot china rahaa or bangladesh main bhi china ke hathiyaaron kaa aayaat bade paimaane par hua

 This added strength to the party's voice as Rahul is a well-known face in the country

 ol india muslim personal lau board ke mahasachiv moulana nizamuddin ne kaha ki sapa pramukh kaa bayaan raajnneeti se prerit he or ve is mudde ko siyaasi rang dena chaahate hai
 He said, 'people living in relief camps are frightened and do not want to go home due to fear
 unka siyasat se koi taalluk nahin he
 If it were, they would not have been removed from their homes
 is tarah ke bayanon se unka nuksaan hi hoga
 Maulana Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid, condemned the SP chief's statement that it was an irresponsible attempt to hide his failures
 bukhari ne kaha ki pichley ravivaar ko unhone apane ek sahyogi ko danga raahat shiviron main rah rahe logon kaa haal lene ke liye bheja tha
 There is no truth that there are no riot victims there
 gauratlab he ki sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne somvaar ko party rajya mukhyalay par yojit kaarykram main kaha tha, ‘mujffarnagar danga peediton ke liye banaae gayi raahat shiviron main ab koi peedit nahin rah rahaa he

 If there are really conspirators of the Congress and BJP in the relief camps, then strong action should be taken against them
 ’ abbaas ne kaha ki sarkaar ko peediton ko vishwaas main lenaa chahie

 bihar kii magadh uniwarsity ke chaatr in dinon vishvavidhyalay prashasan ke khilaaf sadak se lekar soshal media tak apana gussa jaahir kar rahe hai
 The reason for the students' displeasure is the year-on-year delays in the university
 halaat ye he ki pichley do saal se vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne pariksha nahin karai he
 At the same time, the administration is saying to postpone the examination due to the election code of conduct
 vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr soshal media ke jariye apana andolan chede hue hai
 Many such videos are posted on youtube, in which they are expressing their pain
 chaatro ne Aajtak
 Talking to in, said that the examination which was to be held in the month of March last year, has not been done this year as well
 haalanki vishvavidhyalay ne pehle pichley maheene pariksha karaane kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin ab use bhi june tak ke liye taal diya gaya he
 Because of this mess, the degree that should have been got in three years, it will be found in five years, it is not yet decided
 jin chaatro ne 2017 main daakhila liya tha unki ek bhi pariksha ab tak nahin hui he
 Students also went to meet Bihar Governor Lalji Tandon on this issue
 vahaan unki mulaakat nahin karai gai or mahaj shikaayat lekar waapas bhej diya gaya
 Students are fighting for their exams on youtube-facebook when there is no hearing anywhere
 unki pramukh maang he ki unhen rajyapal or mukhyamantri se milakar apni pidaa sunaane kaa mauka diya jaae, sabhi satr samay par puure kiye jaaen
 In this regard, University Controller of Examinations Dr
 anand kumaar singh ne kaha ki kuch maheene main pariksha ho jaaengi
 The Code of Conduct has come into force so the exam dates have been extended
 haalanki jab unase 2017 ke satr main ab tak koi bhi pariksha na hone kaa sawaal poocha gaya to ve ye kahkar taal gaye ki unhen uniwarsity aae 7-8 maheene hi hue he
 So they cannot tell about the first

 On Monday, Shiv Sena was supposed to tell the Governor about forming the government by 7:30 pm but it failed
 use rajyapal ne mangalvaar raat saadhe aath baje tak samay diya he
 It is necessary to understand here why even after coming to such a golden opportunity to join the power, the Congress has hesitated to go with the Shiv Sena
 kya iskaa kaaran shivesna kaa itihaas he
 Let me tell you, Indira Gandhi had raised Shiv Sena to compete with trade unions but gradually the inclination towards radical Hindutva drove Shiv Sena away from Congress
 ab maharashtra kii raajnneeti ek aise chauraahey par aa khadi hui he jisamen sabake daawey alag hai
 Shiv Sena had earlier hoped that the next Chief Minister would be his but the attitude of the Congress changed the Shiv Sena's dreams
 congress ke vidhayak jaipur ke deuna vista resort main tehre hai lekin unke netaaon main dilli main halchal he
 On the other hand Uddhav Thackeray called Sonia Gandhi to form the government but Sonia Gandhi did not open her card

 a team of Congress leaders is scheduled to meet Sharad Pawar in Mumbai
 yani mangalvaar ko har dal apane daanv chalenge lekin isse zyada ye atakalein tej rahengi ki kya shivasena kaa apana mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana puraa hoga?

 The BJP on Tuesday said that the Prime Minister was appointed the Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) by PC Thomas, accused of palmolein import scam, but now he is wrapped like a dragon around Manmohan Singh
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha, bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jaanch karne kaa kaam sibiai karti he
 The CBI is appointed by the CVC head, but when the CVC chief was being appointed, Sushma Swaraj raised an objection to one of Thomas's names, as there were allegations of corruption against him
 bhaajapa ke janajagran abhiyaan ke tahat ek kaarykram main unhone kaha, sarkaar ne vipaksh kii aapatti ke baavjood thomas ko hi sivisi banaaya
 Certainly this work was not done by Raja or Quattrocchi, but by Manmohan Singh
 jetali ne kaha, aaj yah sthiti he ki vartmaan sivisi pradhanmantri ke gale main ajgar kii tarah lipte hue hai
 People say about the Prime Minister that he is an economist and honest
 lekin manmohan singh vicitra prakaar ke eemaandaar vyakti hai, jo aazaadee ke baad desh kii sabase bhrasht sarkaar kaa netritv kar rahe hai
 He said that the CBI does not know what happened to Ruchika and Aarushi
 lekin raajnneetik phaayde ke liye kis prakaar se kisi sarkari agency kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, sibiai iskaa sarvshereshth udhaaharan he
 Significantly, the Supreme Court gave permission to the Kerala government for further hearing in the crores of palmolein oil scam case
 is maamle main thomas or tatkaaleen mukhyamantri ke karunakaran kathith taur par lipt bataae jate hai
 Former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has said that it is the result of the efforts of the previous UPA government that now there are signs of improvement in the economy
 chidambaram ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, pehali timahi ke sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ke aankade jab 5
 7 percent comes, then i said that this is the result of the actions of the UPA government and i stand by it
 unhone kaha, hamane jo kuch 2012, 2013 or march, 2014 tak kiya or arthvyavastha ko aage badhaane ke liye lagaataar jo prayaas kiye, yah usee kaa parinaam he
 The senior Congress leader, however, feared that the new BJP government would be able to maintain this momentum
 unhone kaha, main jab driver kii seat par tha, meraa pair car ke exelrator par tha or car gati ke saath aage bad rahi thi, lekin yah hameshaa ke liye daudti nahin rah sakati, vah chaal car ko kuch duuri tak hi le ja sakati he
 Chidambaram said, we have 5 in the first quarter of 2014-15

 But making cheap rhetoric like NCP Chief Sharad Pawar on this sad issue is also condemnable
 unhone is mudde ko kuch alag dhang se pesh karke peediton kii sahanubhuti luutane kii koshish kii
 They have laid all its blame on the new government at the Center
 unka aarope he ki nai sarkaar ke aate hi alpsankhyakon or daliton par atyaachaar bad gaye hai
 Among those arrested in Pune for the murder of an engineer is a Hindu extremist group Hindu Rashtra Sena
 inamen se 18 ab tak police kii giraft main aa chuke hai
 It is being said about Dhananjay Desai, the head of this institution, that he already has many allegations of inciting violence
 is gut ke kuch sadasyon par july 2013 main ek hindu netaa kii hatya kaa bhi aarope he
 This group has been involved in violent acts for quite some time
 yah baat hairaani kii isliye bhi he ki maharashtra main ek sakht kanoon macoka ke rup main lagu he
 This law is very strict and it is also difficult to get bail if caught in it
 lekin agar yah gut yaa giroh itnaa hi updravi tathaa khoonkhaar he to uske khilaaf is kanoon ko lagu kyon nahin kiya gaya? kyon nahin is par ankush ksaa gaya jabaki maharashtra main sarkaar ensipi-congress kii thi or uske grih mantri pavaar ke khaas aaraar patil hai
 If he wanted, he could control it but it did not happen
 matlab saaf he
 Sharad Pawar wants to hunt two birds with one stone
 pehla to yah ki ve apni sarkaar par lage akarmanyata ke aarope ko jhuthalaanaa chaahate hai
 Second, on the pretext that he wants to garner votes of minorities
 lalu yadav, mulaayam singh, nitish kumaar, mamata banerjee vagairah jaise tathakthith alpsankhyak hitaishi netaaon kii qatari main pavaar bhi khadey ho gaye hai
 After the plight of his party in the Lok Sabha elections, he has understood what will be the condition of the party in the Vidhan Sabha elections
 unhen dar he ki kahin party kaa supada hi na saaf ho jaae
 The NCP, which has been in power for ten years, has nothing to show to the public, on the contrary party leaders are accused of being involved in big scams
 sharad pavaar raajnneeti ke chatur khiladi hai or ab ve koi nayaa mudda dhundh rahe hai taaki party ko praan vaayu mili
 But they have probably forgotten that the days of doing politics by considering minorities as vote banks in this country are over
 bhartiya alpsankhyakon kii soch main badlaav aayaa he or ve soch samajhakar kadam uthaa rahe hai
 It is not easy to trick or entice them
 aakhir pune kii dardanaak ghatana kii jimmedaari maharashtra sarkaar kii bhi he or ensipi iskaa hissaa he
 Obviously, Pawar cannot escape his responsibilities by making such a statement

 shuukravaar ko prasaarit hue episod priyank kii vaapasi dikhaai gai jiske baad gharavaalon ke milijule rispons bhi dekhne ko mili
 But there was an uproar when Arshi Khan and Sapna Chaudhary debated fiercely
 iske baad priyank ne apana rang dikhaate hue sapana ko arshi ke bare main kuch aisa bataaya jo gharavaalon ko bhi hilaa kar rakh dene ke liye kaaphi he
 Bigg Boss 11: Shadow of ghosts on Mehjabi Siddiqui, homegrown sensations, during the debate with Arshi, he just said two words to Pune and Goa, after which Arshi looked quite upset
 arshi ne priyank ke paas jaakar poocha bhi ki usne sapana ko aisa kya kah diya he
 Priyank said on the answer to Arshi's question that he did not know anything about it
 bataa den ki saal 2016 main pune mirar kii ek khabar ke mutabik pune police ko arshi ke sex racket kaa hissaa hone kii bhanak lagi thi
 In this case, a person named Vipul Dahal was described as an agent and was also arrested
 iske baad vipul or arshi kaa ek audio clip bhi saamne aayaa tha jisamen yah baat saamne aa rahi thi ki vah client kii talash main thi
 Arshi Khan is married to Bigg Boss's Glam Girl Arshi Khan, 10 years ago, Arshi's name was also associated with Goa's sex racket
 goa police ne arshi ko five star hotel se giraftaar kiya tha lekin baad main wo reeha ho gai thi or mumbai shift ho gai thi
 a few days ago, Arshi Khan, who hails from Bhopal, was accused by actress Gehna of mistaking her age on the show that she had also married a 50-year-old man
 itnaa hi nahin gahanaa ne arshi par sabase bada aarope ye lagaaya ki unpar 10 aapraadhik maamalon ke cese darj hai
 The biggest case is that Arshi had painted the flag of India and Pakistan on her nude body

 agar hindi cinema main sabase bure boyfriend kaa koi award hota to 29 varshiya rajkumaar raav ko jarur miltaa
 Rajkumar debuted with Love Sex Aur Cheat (2010) and Ragini MMS (2011), in which he used to seduce girls to secretly make their sex videos
 queen (2014) main ve aise duulhe bane jo shaadi se kuch hi ghante pehle rani (kangana ranot) ko chhod jaataa he
 Rajkumar, sitting in his girlfriend, rising actress Anvita Paul's flat in Oshiwara in Mumbai, screams at his screen image, saying that he is not that way in real life
 rajkumaar kaa paanch saal kaa kariyar bandhi-bandhai li par nahin chalaa he
 Most of his time was spent in minor roles in films like Gangs of Wasseypur Part Two and Talaash (both 2012)
 lekin phir raav ke liye halaat bahut teji se badale
 Rao has received the National Award for his role as lawyer and activist Marhum Shahid Azmi in the 2013 film Shahid
 mahesh bhatta se jab coffee vid karan program main poocha gaya ki bollywood kaa bhavishya koun he, to unhone raav par daanv lagaaya
 How do they choose their rolls? He told India Today, "I am a greedy actor
 main damdaar kairactor karnaa chahta hum
 If i get a script like Sathya, i would like to play Bhikhu Mhatre
 ” 2013 kaa saal gudgaanv ke is kalakaar ke jivan main 'bada badlaav’ lekar aayaa
 Instead of hiding the name in a thin line at the end of a film, for the first time Rao's face was capped on the poster of Kai Po Che
 unhen film main saamaajik drushti se thode ajibo-garib govind kii bhoomika ke liye darshakon or aalochakon donon se tarif mili
 The film was based on Chetan Bhagat's story The Three Mistakes of My Life
 darshak jaise hi raav ko pahchaanane lage, aktubar main diarector hansal mehta kii shahid ne unke kariyar ko nai oonchai de di
 The role touched the minds of the audience as Azmi's strengths and weaknesses were exposed
 film ke casting diarector mukesh chhabda kaa kahana he ki unhen nirmaataaon ko is baat par raji karne ke liye khaasi mashkkat kerani padi ki raav us role main feet hai
 Chhabra explains, "it was very difficult to sell the film because of his simple face-piece
" ab actor ke taur par unki saakh ban gai he
 People know that if they are in the film, then something different will happen
 ”raav ko maaloom he ki nai mili pratishtha se jaagi ummiido ko puraa karne kaa dabaav kitna zyada he
 They neither have the stature that one would believe the character of killing five goons at the same time, nor are they any chocolate boy to make the girls go crazy
 raav ne in kamajoriyon ko takat bana liya or irfan khan tathaa navazuddin siddiki kii qatari main shaamil ho gaye
 They are different actors from both, whose Rao is Murid
 raav kehete hai, ''ab chunauti yah he ki ek jaise role na karun
 i want my identity
 maine kabhi kariyar plan nahin kiya
 When the names of the five top actors are written in India, i want to see their names in them as well
 ”raav kaa madhyamvargeey parivaar cinema main hi rota, hansata or jeeta he
 He grew up imitating Shah Rukh in Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), cleared his hands in acting and dance at the Blue Bells Model School and then did theater at Delhi University's Atmaram Sanatan Dharma College
 2005 main jab pune ke film or televijan institute of india (apatiai) ke acting course main daakhila liya, to raav kii jindagi hi badal gai
 Till then there was no introduction to global cinema
 ve sirf tom krooj jaise sitaron ko jaanate the, lekin apatiai main robert di nero or danniel de-louis kii acting par fida ho gaye
 On arriving in Mumbai in 2008, Rao followed day and night behind casting director Atul Mongia to once audition for Dibakar Banerjee's love sex and cheat
 mongia ne baad main raav ko raagini ms or queen main bhi role dilaayaa
 In Mongia's words, "raj is special because he is still engaged when he is not shooting
" unki sabase badi khubi yah he ki ve kisi andhi daud main shaamil nahin
 "nevertheless, it has to be said now that Rao has become a hero
 is saal ke shuru main unhone apana naam rajkumaar yadav se badalakar rajkumaar raav rakh liya
 He says that he wanted to change his name from long ago
 yaari road par apane kiraye ke makaan main raav ko rojaanaa ek-do script padhgaye ko milti hai
 His next release will be Hansal Mehta's Citylights on May 30, which is based on the 2013 English film Metro Manila
 uske baad sonam kapur ke saath doli kii doli, vidya baalan ke saath hamaari adhuri kahani or phir ramesh sippi ke saath ek film aane vaali he
 Rao may have won audiences and critics with his characters, but there is one member in the family who he has not been able to cheer up yet
 unki maa kii khwaahish he ki bete ko film main naachte hue dekhen
 Rao says, "I have told him that i will definitely dance
" bas aisi koi script aa jaae, jisamen mujhe dance karnaa jaruri lage
 "this is indeed a new moment when a Mumbai actor has realized that there must be an argument behind dancing on screen
 desh kii arthvyavastha mandi kii ore he or mahangaai kaa ahsaas aap sabhi kii jebon ko ho rahaa hoga
 Petrol / diesel prices have set a separate fire
 lekin aap shaayad soch bhi nahin sake honge ki is baar dashahra par ravan jalaana bhi mahangaa pad jayega
 It may be that the brightness and brightness of Dussehra may have faded a bit this time, because even the effigy of Ravana has caught sight of GST
 jiesti ke chalate pichhali saal kii apeksha ravan ke putalon kii keemat main tej ijapha hua he
 GST has had an impact on the buyers of Ravan's effigy and Ravan has now become expensive
 ravan, meghnad or kumbhakarnake putalon par bhi mahangaai kii maar padi he
 Ravan has become expensive, as the impact of GST is also visible on the effigy, which will loosen buyers' pockets more
 daramil putala banane main istemaal hone vaali sabhi samagriyaan jiesti ke daayaren main aa chuki hai, jiske chalate putala nirmaan par aane vaali laagat main kaaphi vruddhi hui he
 The paper, color paper, paint, wire and wood used to make mannequins are taxed at 12 to 28 per cent under GST
 jiesti lagu hone ke baad putale banane kii laagat main 20 se 30 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 Traders say that earlier there was no tax on many items, but now all the goods are under GST
 dilli kaa titarpur ilaaka putalon kaa sabase bada bazaar he, jahaan10 foot se lekar 70 foot tak ke ravan ke putalebanaae jate hai, lekin jiesti or mahangaai kii vajah se is baar is bazaar kii rangath bhi phiki hi najar aa rahi he
 The latest films Piku and Tanu Weds Manu Returns have achieved phenomenal success at the box office
 in filmon kii kamyaabi to yahi bataati he ki darshak ab filmon main adarsh kii pratimurti nahin, balki apana aks dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Every interesting character in the film should show some human weaknesses so that people can easily understand them as themselves, connect with them
 isliye aisi har vah film kaamyaab hogi, jisamen piku, tanu or kusum jaise paatr honge
 Piku features Deepika Padukone as Piku and Kangana Ranot in the Tanu Weds Manu Returns, especially as athlete Kusum aka Datto
 aapako yah maananaa hoga ki jaise maine nimrat (cor) ke liye lunch box dobaaraa likhi, ye donon filmein bhi nayikaon ke liye likhi gai hai
 This is definitely a call of the times to come
 in abhinetriyon ne bada manikhej jokhim uthaaya
 If some actors were also in front and were taking similar risks then we would not have said such a thing
 jab piku kaa purush mitra uske pita ke ghar main raat bitaata he yaa tanu apane pati ko paagalakhaane main chhodkar chali aati he to kai logon ko laga ki ise darshakon kaa bada varg pasand nahin karegaa
 So should it be reconsidered? Both of them thought highly of it and then said, "whatever it is, i will do it
" "aapako kuch shrey to duusare logon ko bhi dena hoga
 In Piku, Irrfan also plays an amazing role
 deepika ke saath irfan ne prem kahani ko vaaki jeevant bana diya he
 R
 in Tanu Weds Manu Returns madhavan aise sthir paatr kii bhoomika main hai, jo sari uthal-puthal ke bich bhi shant bane hue hai
 We need such male characters in society and films, who allow women to play a central role
 yah behad jaruri he
 People later like to analyze events and formulate their arguments
 lekin piku or tanu vaids manu riterns kii kamyaabi kii buniyadi vajah yah he ki patakatha acchhee likhi gai thi or kendriya bhoomikaaon main adbhut abhinay dekhne ko mila
 This made the script more powerful
 duusare paatro kii bhoomika main bhi thik-thaak abhinay dekhne ko mila
 All the actors played excellent roles
 ham filmon ke bare main yah sochate hai ki "aakhir yahi to darshak chaahate hai
 "but a film is the story the filmmaker wants to tell
 basharte kahani eemaandaaree se likhi gai ho
 The audience knows people like the characters in the film
 apane aasapaas kii duniya main dekhte hai
 Characters like those in Tanu Weds Manu Returns are four steps ahead of those around us
 lekin phir bhi aise log samaaj main hai
 People like it because there is some truth to life in it
 bhartiya samaaj main hamane lambey samay se mahilaon ko dabaae rakhane kii koshish kii he
 But this does not mean to say that this is the only truth of India
 bhartiya samaaj bahut vyapak or pechida he
 We saw informal relationships with her office partner in Piku
 aisa nahin he ki hindustan main aisa nahin hota he, balki iske pehle ham aise rishton ke bare main baat nahin kiya karte the
 Actually, this thinking and mindset is changing now
 ab filmkaar ek khaas darshak varg kii pasand-naapsand kii chintaa chhodkar kehane lage hai, "meraa to yahi maananaa he or ab aap khud ise film main dekh lo
 "I don't think that filmmaking is a genre in which everyone's choice is taken care of
 aisa karnaa to phijul hi sabit hoga
 It is also not possible that by trying to make a film that will please everyone, you will make a very great film
 darshak hi tay kar rahe hai ki mukhyadhara kya he
 For the past few weeks, the heads of several studios in Mumbai have been searching for, "hey, is there a female-centric film?" This is a pleasant sign
 ek filmkaar hone ke naate is baat se aapako takat milti he
 You know that the script and story have real significance
 faisle marketing yaa sitaron ke irdagird nahin ghoomte
 My next project, based on the book The Sense of Ending by Nobel Prize-awarded author Julian Barnes, is a Mumbai-based love story and a new-age woman's tale
 aisi filmein bharat hi nahin, duniya bhar main hai, jinamein koi purush sitara darshakon ke aakarshan kaa centre hota he
 People of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan go to the flock because of their huge number of fans
 kya koi mahila star bhi aisi ho sakati he, jiske liye log khinche chale aaen? kyon nahin ho sakati
 It is the case of story writers and filmmakers that they create such characters
 yah dekhakar sukhad aashcharya hota he ki log paise kharch karke apni rajamandi jaahir kar rahe hai or kah rahe hai ki aisi hi filmein to ham dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Now it is up to us to provide such a compelling story
 (ritesh batra da lunch box film ke liye puraskaar praapt lekhak-nirdeshak hai) The common man has the advantage of mutual competition of companies and companies joining hands

 ) After the Supreme Court order, some loving adult couples and inter-caste and inter-religious marriages living under the fear of Khap panchayats have got some relief, but the real challenge remains
 sawaal he ki kya is aadesh ke baad khap panchayatein khud ko badalengi?isaki guarantee rajya sarkaron or prashasnic vyavastha ke paas tabhi sambhav he, jab adeshon ko eemaandaaree se lagu kiya jaae
 Its scope is rarely seen in the compulsion of caste politics and vote bank
 supreme court ne mangalvaar ko apane aadesh main kaha, “agar ek vayask purush or mahila shaadi karte hai to koi khap, panchayat, vyakti yaa samaaj un par sawaal nahin uthaa sakate hai

 Whether they are in the same village, gotra, marriage or inter-caste or inter-religious marriage
 kai baar to panchayaton ke faisle ‘honor kiling’ kaa kaaran bhi bane
 In a petition filed by the 'shaktivahini' NGO in 2010, the Supreme Court gave this order, in which the retired General Satyanarayana Vats is an advocate on behalf of the Khapas
 ve kehete hai, “kisi khap panchayat ne kabhi bhi kisi kii hatya kaa farmaan nahin sunaaya he or na hi iskaa koi ricard he
 We are opposed to honor killing and only want respect for traditions and customs
 ” aakhir ye paramparaayen or reeti rivaaj kya hai? darasal khap panchayatein kahati rahi hai ki samaan gotra main vivaah se anuvaanshik bimariyon kii sambhaavna he
 Inbreeding or marrying in a group develops harmful genes and future children may suffer from many diseases
 lekin aisa ek jati athwa upjati main vivaah karne se bhi sambhav he
 In such a situation, only inter-caste and inter-religious marriages can stop them
 lekin khap panchayatein inaki bhi ghor virdohi hai
 Khap panchayats are a system of Jat fraternity in western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan
 jo ek gotra yaa phir birdari ke sabhi gotra par aadhaarit hai
 In western Uttar Pradesh, Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait was the head of the Balian Khap and this khap has considerable influence here
 prabhaavshaalee gotra kaa vyakti hi khap kaa mukhiya hota he
 Tribes with less population are involved, but not decisive
 sarvakhap panchayat main sabhi birdariyaan hoti hai

 ve
 K
 sharma ‘shammi’ bataate hai “saamaajik vyavasthaaon ko banaae or niyantrit rakhane ke liye panchayat ek vyavastha he
 In the Jat society, this justice system is prevalent in the form of Khap Panchayat
 kisi samasya ko pehle parivaar or phir samudaay yaa panchayat main laayaa jaataa he
 If the problem is related to gotra then there is gotra panchayat through which the convict is surrounded
 ” lekin gotra yaa khap panchayatein isse kahin aage badhkar faisle karti hai
 Chau of Muzaffarnagar on 12 March 1941
 mahendra singh tikait ke gaanv sisouli kii panchayat main liye gaye ek sankalp main kaha gaya, “sab apane dil, sharir or aatma se apni khap ke bhale ke liye apane choudhary ke netritv main kaam karenge
 Khap Chaudhary has the right to demand our lives for this
 ” panchayatein kis disha main bad rahi hai, yah sankalp isaki baangi bhar tha
 There is no representation of women in the Khapas
 duusari jati ke log yaa to maujuud hi nahin hote or yadi hote hai to ve apni baat nahin rakh pate hai
 If we look at some of the popular cases and the decisions taken on them, then it is known that what is the purpose of such panchayats? On July 7, 2012, in a panchayat of Asara village under Ramala Thana in Baghpat district, it was said, "the love-marriages must either leave the village or the wife
 anyathaa is yugal ko gaanv main nahin ghusane diya jayega
 "the same panchayat also arranged that women would not use mobile phones and women below 40 years of age would not go out of the house alone
 gaanv kii mahilaon kaa sir hameshaa dhanka hona chahie
 There were 14 couples in this village who had a love marriage
 panchayat farmaan ke ek maah baad hi darjan bhar nakaabposh hamlaawaron ne gaanv kii sadaken khun se rang deen
 Kala and Sajida, who were married to Prem, entered the house and showered indiscriminate fire and killed the young man's father and sister
 24 sitambar 2012 ko shamali main sarvakhap panchayat hui, jisamen choudhary mahendra singh tikait ne sagotra vivaah par sajaa-e-maut kii baat kahi
 Khap and caste panchayat convention on endogamy marriage advocated complete ban
 is mudde par shamali main uttar bharat ke khap mukhiyaaon kaa jamaavada laga
 In such cases, he called for a fight from road to parliament, advocating for more stringent legislation
 aise main saaf he ki raajnneetik dal yaa sarkarein khap panchayaton ke virodh main khadey hone kii kitni takat rakhte hai or sawaal vahi he ki kya vaaki supreme court ke aadesh eemaandaaree se lagu ho paaenge?mujffarnagar kii sabase badi baalion khap ke choudhary divangat mahendra singh tikait ke putr naresh tikait kehete hai, “khap panchayat samaaj main faili kuritiyon ko dur karne ke liye kaam karti hai or sainkado saalon se saamaajik paramparaon kaa paalan karaane ko faisle bhi leti hai
 We value the Hon'ble Supreme Court, but tampering with social systems is wrong
 “duusari ore akhil bhartiya jat aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh yashpal malik kaa maananaa he, “kisi khap panchayat ne kabhi aisa koi faisla nahin sunaaya jo gaiyrkanoonee ho
 Some self-styled leaders may have done such work
 supreme court ko khap panchayaton kaa bhi paksh bhi sun lenaa chahie ki ve aakhir kya chaahati hai
 We are also against the people who issued the edict
 court yah bhi dekhe ki parampara kya he or galat kya he
 Those who made wrong decisions have also gone to jail

 Pagalpanti Review: bollywood main kamedi filmon kaa matlab akasar dher saare sitaron or mindles jokes se nikaala jaataa he
 Today, when a comedy-based comedy film like 'dreamgirl' and 'bala' is coming, 'pagalpanti' is such a film in which there is no idea of the story
 hansi jokes par aati nahin he, or sitaron kii acting ek samay par jaakar sirdard lagane lagati he
 Anees Bazmee continues on his old fundament of filmmaking, and in this affair he continues to leave the story behind
 isi vajah se jon abraham, arshad varsi, anil kapur, saurabh shukla, pulakit samraat, urvashi rotela, eliana dicrooj or kriti kharbandi kii 'paagalpanti' kamedi film ke taur par puri tarah se niraash karti he
 The story of 'pagalpanti' is that of the three friends John Abraham, Arshad Warsi and Pulkit Samrat
 jon abraham (john Abraham) ke saath kuch sahi nahin hota
 But one day an accident happens that the lives of all the three friends get derailed, and the three reach out to London don Don Saurabh Shukla and Anil Kapoor
 in donon ke bhi apane kuch dard hai, or sabake dard kii ek hi vajah he niraj modi
 Which has cost India crores of rupees
 niraj modi ke paatr ko asal jindagi se prerit kar banaaya gaya he
 Then begins a variety of fickle, and useless action filled comedy
 vaise bhi film ke trailor relies ke dauraan hi ishaara kar diya gaya tha ki 'dimag mat lagaana
 'this thing is also understood by watching the film
 'paagalpanti (pagalpanti)' main kahani puri tarah missing haiy
 The film is also heavily drawn
 'paagalpanti' ke kai jokes hansaate hai, lekin puri film main aise maukey kam hi aate hai
 Anees Bazmee's 'pagalpanti' dominates the shadow of his superhit film 'welcome'
 diarection ke maamle main anis bajmi ne apane puraane style ko hi apanaaya he
 In 'pagalpanti', he has tried to create forgetfulness through many stars
 paagalpanti main anil kapur, saurabh shukla or arshad varsi kii comic timming acchhee he, jabaki jon abraham niraash karte hai
 The film's heroines Ileana d'cruz, Kriti Kharbanda and Urvashi Rautela are seen working very hard, but fail to leave a mark
 paagalpanti kaa mujeec thik-thaak he
 However 'pagalpanti' is a complete family comedy, and viewers who love the Anees Bazmee style comedy may find it good

 '' sardiyaan aate hi aapako apni skin main kaaphi badlaav najar aaenge jaise ki skin main khinchaav, suukhaapan or glo kaa chalaa janaa
 The skin becomes dry as soon as winter comes
 sardiyon main skin kaa sabase zyada khyaal rakhana padataa he
 We cannot stop the changing weather, but by making some changes in our lifestyle, we can make the skin beautiful and healthy
 kaise rakhen twachaa kaa khyaal?-sabase pehle bahut garm pani se na nahaakar gunagune pani se nahayen
 Hot water removes the natural oils of the skin, due to which the skin becomes very dry
 agar aapaki skin dry hi he to chehre or sharir par sabun kaa istemaal kam karen
 Soap causes great damage to your skin

 Is similar to h which uses dryness
 phir bhi agar aapako chehre pe kaaphi dryness mahasoos ho to apane chehre ko sabun yaa phesavash kii jagah cleansing milk se saaf karen, iske baad ek alcohol free toner or moshchurizer kaa bhi istemaal karen
 Lemon will protect India's first Rafale aircraft from evil eyes, what is the astrology? If your skin is dry, then use a good body lotion or body butter for the body and keep a good moisturizer for the face
 ek acha moischarizer yaa body loshan kharidte samay yaad rakhen ki usamen shia butter yaa cocoa butter, achche natural oils jaise baadaam, jaitoon or glisreen hon
 Even if your skin is oily, there is a lack of water in it
 is samay aapke chehre ko ek jail besd moischarizer kii jarurat hoti he jisamen oil naa ho par achche moischarising agents jaise aloevera, glisreen, helluronic acid, kukumbar or watermelan ke gun hon
 The more water you drink, the more hydrated your skin will be

 Eat nutritious food instead of external things
 fal or subjiyon kaa adhik se adhik prayog karen
 Cosmetologist Abhipriya Mishra says that just as our breathing is important, skin breathing is also necessary
 hamaari skin ke upar ek ded skin kii parat ban jaati he jisaki vajah se hamaari skin saans nahin le paati
 Due to dead cells, our skin looks dry and does not glow
 in ded cells ko samay-samay par hataanaa bahut jaruri hota he jise ham exfoliation kehete he
 For this, use face scrub twice a week
 skin kaa healdi hona bahut jaruri he kyonki wo hamaare sharir kaa ek kavach he
 Therefore, it is not necessary to take care of the skin just to look beautiful
 jitna swasth hamaara sharir hoga utani hi swasth hamaari skin hogi

 By dividing the 2,500 km circle of the Himalayas into 10 regions and placing each of them roughly with a major earthquake of centuries past, the team of scientists found that six of these areas had slipped further 4-6 meters
 iskaa matlab tha ki in sabhi kshetron ke bheetar, dabaakar rakhi gai ek vishaal spring kii tarah, itnaa zyada khinchaav paidaa ho chukaa he ki vah kabhi bhi ek bade jalajle kii tarah foot saktaa he
 The central Himalayas are particularly at the mouth of Uttarakhand, especially between Dehradun and Kathmandu
 baichaiyn dhartidharti ke bheetar kii ajeeb hulchalon ke neeche platon kii banaavat plate tectonics kii nautanki chal rahi he
 These extremely massive plates holding the continents and oceans in the solid upper part of the Earth are pushing each other
 iity-khadgpur main bhugarbhashastra or bhubhautikee ke praadhyaapak wiliam ke
 "there was only one super super continent about 14 million years ago," says Mohanty
 samay ke saath vah tukdon main tuutata chalaa gaya
 6 even 6
 5 karod saal pehle bhi bharat dakshini golardh kaa ek dweep tha
 But he moved rapidly towards north
 jab bharat kii asia se takkar hui, to isane tibet ko upar dhakel diya or khud bahut gaharaai main khiskkar uske neeche aa gaya
 In this way a huge rocky mountain was born, which we know as Himalayas
 mahaj 5 karod saal main mount everest 9 kimi se kuch hi kam oonchai tak uth gaya
 "but this cycle has not stopped," says Mohanty
 ʼʼ himalay kii parvat shrunkhlaayein ab bhi har saal 2 senmi upar uth rahi hai
 And India is also constantly moving northwards
 isse asian bhubhag par jabardast khinchaav paidaa ho gaya he, jo tibet ko upar kii ore dhakel rahaa he or himalay ko ek vishaal spring kii tarah anth, ghuma or marod rahaa he
 Mohanty says, "one day this spring will crack and the Himalayas will slide forward in a huge waterfall
" ʼʼ sirf ek bhimkaay jaljla lakhon varg kimi bhubhag par jabardast tabaahi barapa degaa or lakhon logon kii jindagi ko khatre main daal degaa
 "from Afghanistan to Arunachal Pradesh and the Andaman Islands below, especially from the crores of people, the devastation of the Ganges can be predicted," he says
 ʼʼplaton kii banaavat kii is ladaai ne hi uttar bharat ko hatyare jalajalon kii badtareen yaaden di hai
 Four major earthquakes in the Himalayan region (8
 0-8
 7) They came - Assam in 1897, Kangra in 1905, Bihar in 1934 and Assam earthquake in 1950
 ye sabhi bukamp dharti ke vishaal khandon ke ek-duusare se aage-peeche khisakane kii vajah se aae the
 The Shillong plateau rose 11 meters after the burning of 1897
 kangra main 19,800 log maare gaye the or bukamp ke jatke sudur purab main kolkata tak mahasoos kiye gaye the
 jal-jala of bihar-nepal killed 16,000 people
 1950 main assam kaa bukamp 20veen sadi kaa 10waan sabase bada bukamp tha
 Is the forecast possible? In the 1960s, when Gaud was studying, studying earthquakes was like reconnaissance in the dark
 tab na to satellite hua karti thi or na hi global pojishning system (jeepies)
 The science of the movements of tectonic plates was mostly unknown
 platon kii halchal ko samajhane ke liye bukamp vaale kshetron main chaden daali jaati thim or yah dekhne ke liye intjaar kiya jaataa tha ki kitne samay main ve kitna khisakati hai
 By the 1980s, a new wave of machines and equipment started, due to which science was able to understand things more accurately
 mitra kehete hai, ''aaj ham jeepies kaa istemaal karke bukamp kshetron ko lagaataar or millimetre tak sateek naap sakate hai ki kahaan saapeksh hulchale ho rahi hai or kahaan dabaav ban rahaa he
 ʼʼ Now there are such modern seismometers which 0
 1 nanometer halchal ke liye 1 angstrum tak ke companon ko pakad sakate hai yaa bilkul cat scan kii tarah bukampiy tarangon kii tasviren khinch sakate hai
 Mitra says, "with his help we can tell in advance where the earthquake will occur, how much intensity and how big it will be
" lekin yah ham ab bhi nahin bataa sakate ki bukamp kab aayega
 The predictions of the Jalals have been more wrong than what has come out correctly
 mohanti kehete hai, ''1975 main china ne hicheng bukamp kii bilkul sahi-sahi bhavishyavaanee kar di thi
 ठीक Just a day before the earthquake, many lives were saved by evacuating buildings, even then 1,328 people were killed
 iske baad bhi 1976 main bhakamp ke purvanumaan kii sabase ahm naakaamiyon main se ek beijing ke najadik tungashan shahar main 27 july, 1976 ko aayaa bukamp tha, jo bagaiyr kisi chetavanee ke aayaa or 2,50,000 jaane le gaya
 He says, "A lot of things are working behind the waterways
 ʼʼjalajle kai kism kii hulchalon se paidaa ho sakate haih ve dharti ke bheetar chal rahi tectonic hulchalon ke kaaran ho sakate hai, ve jwalamukhiyon kii hulchalon se aa sakate hai, bhuskhalanon yaa nabhikeey or / yaa rasinic visphoton kii vajah se vishaal bhumigat gaddhon main dughartnaon kii vajah se chote bukamp ho sakate hai
 "all earthquakes have their own different mechanisms," says Mohanty
 kabhi-kabhi bukamp se pehle radon sareekhee gaisen (zyaadaatar chattaanon main maujuud uranium ke radioective sadaa se) nikalati hai, kabhi-kabhi bade jalajle se pehle choti-choti daraaren aati hai, kabhi-kabhi us ilaake main pani ke swaad main fark aa jaataa he (masalan aisa japan main aksar hota he) or kabhi koi sanket nahin miltaa
 James Jackson, head of geology at Cambridge University in the UK, was in Kathmandu to attend a conference just a week before the Nepal earthquake shook
 unhone ek press vaarta main kaha, ''(nepal) ek kism kaa duswapn tha, jo ghatane kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 From the physical and geological point of view, what happened was exactly what we had predicted

 He used to earn close to 30 thousand, but his work has been stopped for three days
 mumbai main zyaadaatar angdia or unase kaarobaar karne vaale bhi gujarati hai
 Experts say that the reason for Angadia's closure of the business is the diwali holiday along with the ban on big notes
 lekin ye zyada din band nahin rahegaa
 An Angadiya businessman claimed to have resumed work from 14 November

 But their business is that it starts again after a few days

 Mumbai's Angadiya businessman, on the condition of anonymity, told that he Rajana is doing business worth around Rs 1 crore

 Most of Angadia and her businessmen in Mumbai are also Gujaratis

 But it will not be closed for long
