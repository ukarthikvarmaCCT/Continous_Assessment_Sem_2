 In the last two years, Disability Pension was distributed to more than two thousand military officers of other ranks, including Brigadier and Major General
 sainya adhikariyon ke bich disability pension kaa trend us samay bad rahaa he, jab sena isamen kami karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 In the year 2018, 977 officers below the rank of Colonel along with 52 Brigadier and above rank officers got the benefit of Disability Pension
 isse pehle saal 2017 main 35 brigadier or isse upar ke rank ke adhikariyon ke saath 960 junior adhikariyon ko disability pension kaa laabh mila
 Let me tell you that the officers who get disability pension get more compensation from their retired officers

 At present, the government does not tax disability pension

 In this regard, the Army headquarters on Tuesday said that the disability pension being given to the military officers was kept out of the income tax, due to which the trend of taking disability pension among the military officers has increased rapidly
 yahaan tak ki sainya adhikari life style kii vajah se hone vaali bimaariyaan par bhi disability pension kii maang kar rahe hai
 The Army said that when the challenges of security of the nation are increasing, the demand for Disability Pension among the military officers is increasing at a rapid time

 The reason for this is that the number of disabled officers and jawans in the army is not so much, as many people are claiming disability pension

 aipal ne pehali bardual simsport vaala iphone launch kiya he
 However, the iphone Xs with physical dual sim support will only be launched in China
 bharat main e-sim saport vaala verient launch hoga
 The first question that comes to your mind is how the e-sim will work
 apalke liye i-sim kaa concept nayaa nahin he, kyonki pichley saal company ne Apple Watch Series 3 cellular adishan main bhi i-sim saport diya tha

 But E-SIM is considered more efficient than common physical SIM
 iske alaava aapako ek sim lekar bhi chalane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 With e-sim, you can use different data packs of two companies, use calling plans and keep two numbers
 ek number par kol aane par doosraa number vyast batayega
 However, calls can be made to any number at a time
 yphone ek baar main sirf ek cellular data network yuj karata he, kyonki isamen dual sim dual standbai feechar diya gaya he
 Some dual simsmartphones have dual sim dual active support so they can use two networks at once

 It is possible to escape by saying anything in politics and tightening the falsehood and truth in the figures has not become part of the TV debates, otherwise, the new political formula for calculating the economic growth rate (GDP) and the figures derived from it changed the country's political discourse
 Would have gone pradhanmantri apni reliyon main upie ke das saal ko koste nahin dikhte
 The government would get into questions as soon as it was said that nothing has changed in fifteen years
 sarkaar ne jidipi gananaa ke nae paimaane se desh kii iconomi kaa taaja ateet hi badal diya he
 According to these figures, the last two years in India were not of recession and unemployment but of spectacular growth
 pichley saal kii vikaas dar paanch fisad se kam nahin balki saat fisad ke kareeb thi
 That is, the atmosphere of recession and unemployment, which played a central role in bjp's unprecedented victory in the Lok Sabha elections, was not present according to these figures
 pichley do-teen varshon main bhartiya arthvyavastha sachmuch gahari mandi kaa shikaar thi yaa hamaari paimaaish hi galat thi? athwa nai sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad paimaaish kaa tarika badal diya taaki tasviir ko behatar dikhaaya ja sake? donon hi sawaal doorgaami hai or aarthik va rajnatik rup se dohare nuksaan-phaaydon se las hai
 Debate has started in economic circles, which will reach the politics after Delhi elections
 jidipi kii growth kisi desh kii tarakkee kaa buniyadi paimaana he jo nivesh ke faisle or sarkaar kii nitiyon kii disha tay karata he
 If new GDP figures are accepted, then the perspective of the coming budget will change
 bharat main sakal gharelu utpaadan (kheti, udyog, seva) kii gananaa philhal buniyadi laagat (basic cost) par hoti he yani jo keemat nirmaataa yaa utpaadak ko milti he
 The new formula will include basic cost plus indirect tax to calculate production cost
 sarkaar ne yah aankada lagu karne ke liye 2011-12 kii keemton ko aadhaar banaaya or paanch lakh companiyon (pehle sirf 2,500 companiyon kaa sample) se aankade jutaaye, jinke baad 2013-14 main desh kii iconomi 6
 Climbed to a height of 9 per cent, 4 in previous figures
 7 fisad thi
 Such changes have created deep political and economic confusion in the middle of the financial year
 bharat main pichley teen saal mahangaai, mandi, bekaari, oonchi byaaj dar, ghatate utpaadan or companiyon ke kharaab pradarshan ke the
 In these circumstances, no fresh example of fast growth is found in the world
 nai sarkaar kaa pehla purna bajet mandi se jang par kendrit hone vaala tha taaki rojgaar bad saken
 Expectations of interest rate reduction were also based on this assessment
 alabatta jidipi ke nae aankadon ke mutabik, growth, rojgaar or kamai pehle se bad rahi he isliye modi sarkaar kaa pehla purna bajet sakht vittiya anushaasan or das fisadi growth kii taiyaari par aadhaarit hona chahie na ki mandi se ubarne ke liye udyogon ko protsaahan or kamai main kami se pareshaan aam logon ko kar raahat dene par
 The controversy is such that the Reserve Bank did not include this new scale in the latest monetary review
 vitt mantralay ke aarthik salaahkaar arvind subrahmanyam bhi achraj main hai
 In the bjp's Lok Sabha victory, the depression of the Congress Raj and the disappointment stemming from unemployment played an important role
 bijepi ko yah baat acchhee tarah se maaloom he ki in aankadon se upie ke daur main aarthik prabandhan kii behatar tasviir hi saamne nahin aati he balki upie ke puure shasankaal main aarthik growth kaa cheharaa khaasaa chamakdaar ho jaataa he, jise lekar congress khud behad sharminda rahi thi
 Despite this, the change in scale has been accepted because the latest figures also include nine months of the Modi government, which can show a shining growth
 yadi vitt mantri arun jetali ko apni sarkaar ke nau maah ko shandaar bataanaa he to unhen apane bajet bhaashan kii shuruyaat kuch isi tarah se kerani hogi ki, ''sabhapati mahoday, mujhe behad prasannataa he ki tamaam vipareet paristhitiyon ke baavjood bhartiya arthvyavastha ne pichley saal yani 2013-14 main shandaar growth darj kii
 Despite the global recession, high inflation, high interest rates in the country and decrease in demand, earnings and employment also increased last year
 isse ek saal pehle bhi sthiti bahut kharaab nahin rahi thi
 "obviously, in this speech the praise of upa's economic management will also be hidden
" or vitt mantri yadi 'pichley das varshon main sab barbaad' kii dharna par kaayam rahete hai to phir jidipi kii gananaa kaa nayaa formula hi khaarij ho jayega
 The cat of figures has come out of the bag
 ek bade global niveshak kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar ko buniyadi aankadon ko lekar saaf-suthra hona chahie
 Whatever the politics behind the growth figures in place of recession, it will now spread all-round confusion
 ham ab tak is baat par mutmain the ki bharat ko mandi se ubarne kii koshish kerani he lekin ab to yah bhi tay nahin he ki arthvyavastha mandi main he yaa growth daud rahi he
 The latest GDP data on the basis of the new scale will come just a day before the Delhi election results which can start a China-like debate on the quality of data in India and its political use which will make the Modi government uncomfortable

 The foundation of a good relationship rests on mutual coordination and understanding
 irshyaa or zyada ummiden ise kharaab hi karti hai
 If they increase beyond the limit, then the end of that relationship is always the breakup
 yahaan ham aapako ladakiyon kii aisi 5 aadaton ke bare main bataa rahe hai jinaki vajah se kai barrilation brallep kii kagaar par pahunch jaataa he
 They do not even know about it themselves and by the time this is understood, it is too late
 insicurity honaarishte main duusare ko thodi chhot dete hue vishwaas kii door majboot rakhana behad jaruri he
 If you check their phone continuously, they will make meaning of their posts on Facebook, note the timings of their movements everywhere, see every friend of theirs with suspicion, then this relation will not last long
 aapaki yah harakatein dikhaati hai ki aap kitni insikyor hai or aapmen rishte sanbhaalane kii samajhadaari nahin he
 Try to change them, if you want to change them, then how did you love them? The desire to change them means that you want to mold them according to your convenience or choice and know that it is not tolerable to men at all
 aamtaur par mardon ko apane hisaab se rahanaa pasand hota he or ve apni aadaten kisi ke liye bhi badalanaa nahin chaahate
 Even if they know that they are deficient, instead of removing it, they prefer to get away from the relationship
 gender kaa antar nahin samajhatinapane kisi khaas maukey ke liye koi special planning kii thi lekin samaj na paane kii vajah se unhone aapkaa saath nahin diya
 You had expected that there would be a special reaction from their food, but it did not happen
 isse aapkaa mood of or jhagada shuru
 
 
 However, he will not understand where the bug is
 yahaan aapako samajhane kii jarurat he ki vah aapse alag hai or har maamle main aapaki soch nahin pakad sakate
 The sooner you understand this, many of your problems regarding the relationship will be solved with ease
 hameshaa munh phulae rahan xxrep 4 a p unki galatiyon ko nazarandaaj nahin kar paati hai or iske liye hameshaa taana detii rahati hai
 If she does something good, instead of praising, she bows at the old things
 ab aap hi sochen ki is par unako kaisaa lagata hoga? apni tarif sunanaa sabhi ko pasand hota he or isse relation main mithaas bhi rahati he
 So instead of counting their shortcomings, acknowledge their good efforts wholeheartedly and praise them for this
 soshal life khatm kar denaladkiyaan aksar kisi rishte main aane ke baad usee daayre main simat jaati hai or doston se kinaaraa kar leti hai
 With this, she always thinks about her partner and then expects a message or call every now and then
 jab partner kii ore se unki yah ummid puri nahin hoti he tab ve pareshaan hoti hai
 In such a situation, it is better to maintain your circle with the relationship
 jab aap apane main biji rahengi to duusari taraf se aapmen dilchaspee bhi barkaraar rahegi

 mausam vibhaag kaa anumaan sahi sabit hua ki saal 2018 monsoon ke lihaaj se acha rahegaa or saal ke dauraan pramukh dakshin-pashchimi monsoon lambii avadhi main ausatan 97 fisadi rahegaa
 This assessment of the Meteorological Department was a great relief to the farmers as it would strengthen the country's major procurement
 vahiin yah akalan centre main sattarudh modi sarkaar ke liye bhi badi raahat lekar aayaa he
 a good monsoon was going to give the central government a chance to correct its economic data ahead of the general elections due in 2019
 lekin achche monsoon ke baavjood ab kisaanon ke saath-saath sarkaar ke liye nai chunauti khadi ho gai he
 The returning monsoon is raining continuously in many parts of the country and the biggest threat from this rain is hovering over the standing paddy crop in the fields
 kya he acha monsoon?saamaanya, ausat yaa phir achche monsoon kaa matlab he ki 50 saal kii lambii avadhi ke ausat kaa lagbhag 96 fisadi se 104 fisadi barish kaa hona
 Average rainfall in 50 years is 89 cm or 35 inches of rain during the four months of monsoon
 achche monsoon kii yah paribhaasha mausam vibhaag dwaara di gai he
 At the same time, less than 90 percent of the rain is in drought conditions in the country
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri modi ke kaarykaal ke pehle do saal 2014 or 2015 main sookhe kii sthiti rahi or iske chalate desh ke aarthik aankadon main joardaar giravat dekhne ko mili
 After this, monsoon remained normal during 2016 and 2017 and its benefit was reflected in the economic data and the economy started picking up
 petrol-dijal kii keemton se yun tel nikaal rahi sarkaar, jaane windfall genmodi sarkaar ke kaarykaal kaa aakhri saal 2018 ke dauraan ummid ke mutabik acha monsoon dekhne ko mila lekin lautatemonsoonanekisanaur sarkaar kii ummid par pani pherane kii kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 According to the Meteorological Department, even 110 per cent rainfall is not good for the economy, although it does not show the loss of weak monsoon
 adhik barish kii sthiti main fasalon ke kharaab hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he or desh ke kai ilaakon main baadh kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he
 Importance of Monsoon The monsoon starts from the southern coast of Kerala from June 1 and in the middle of July this monsoon covers the entire country
 is monsoon se desh ko kul vaarshik barish kaa lagbhag 70 fisadi miltaa he
 This rain determines the production of rice, wheat, sugarcane, oilseeds and soyabean, the major kharif crops in the country
 vahiin in fasalon par aadhaarit desh kaa krishi kshetra kul jidipi kaa 15 fisadi he or lagbhag desh kii aadhi jansankhya ko rojgaar is kshetra main miltaa he
 Therefore, good monsoon increases the annual income of 50 percent of the population based on it, increasing the yield in the country
 vahiin is jansankhya kii badi hui aamadani ke sahare desh main upabhokta utpaadon kii maang main bada ijapha hota he
 This cycle further increases the share prices of agricultural companies in the country and at the same time increases the demand for auto mobiles (motorcycles, tractors, threshers etc
) in rural India
 kharaab aarthik aankade ke bich hoga chunaav?desh main june se july tak chalane vaale achche monsoon se arthvyavastha ke kai kshetron par asar padataa he
 India is dependent on itself in food production, so while good monsoon increases kharif crop yields, in the event of poor monsoon and drought, the government is forced to import food items
 lihaaja, acha monsoon sarkaar kaa aayaat kharch kam karata he
 The central government is free to spend this money to provide infra development or basic facilities in the country
 lekin aisa tab sambhav hota he jab monsoon ke baad kharif fasalon kii acchhee paidaavaar dekhne ko mili
 The way rain has been seen in many parts of the country for the past one week
 krishi jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki isse kharif paidaavaar par bura asar padegaa or khadyaan utpaadan ummide se kam ho saktaa he
 Therefore, economic experts say that if the kharif yields deteriorate, the impact will start to show on the economy within 3-4 months and most of the economic data will be seen under pressure just before the elections
 in sectors main hoga bada nuksaapchche monsoon se desh ke gramin ilaakon main kisaanon kii aamadani main ijapha ho jaataa he
 With the increased income, farmers work on buying tractors, buying scooters and motorcycles, buying gold and silver for children's wedding, spending on children's education and higher education
 jiske chalate share bazaar par krishi kshetra kii companiyon ke share main ijaphe ke saath-saath auto sector ke share, farm equipment companiyon ke share samet upabhokta utpaada companiyon ke share main acchhee oochaal dekhne ko milti he
 But in the event of poor kharif yields, this rain can become a curse for the farmers and instead of the benefits of a good monsoon, farmers begin to suffer
 joshi kii cameti kaa PMO ko notice, raghuram rajan kii NPA list par kya ection liya?bad jayega bainkon kaa enpischche monsoon se desh main banking vyavastha ko majbootee milti he
 Most of the farmers in the country arrange loans for kharif crops from government, cooperative or rural banks
 monsoon behatar hone kii sthiti main in bainkon ko karj par diya paisa waapas milane kii guarantee ho jaati he or unhen apane enpie ko kaabo karne main madad milti he
 At the same time, due to increased income of farmers, banks get good savings in the account of their rural branches, which makes the job of giving new loans to the non-agricultural sector easier
 lekin kisaanon kii fasal kharaab hote hi sabase pehla dabaav desh main banking kshetra main dekhne ko miltaa he
 While the government and cooperative banks of the country are already upset due to the increased npas and farmers 'debt waiver, another crop wastage of the banks' investment in agriculture is in a state of drowning
 mahangaai banegachunavka sabase bada muddagauratlab he ki desh main aam chunaav april-may 2019 ke dauraan karaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 By this time, the good monsoon will have done its job and the farmer will be hoping for a good rabi crop after the income from the good kharif crop
 jahaan kendra sarkaar ko ummid thi ki aam chunaavon se pehle yah doharaa bonus modi sarkaar kii ek baar phir satta main vaapasi karne main madad karegaa vahiin ab achche monsoon ke baavjood kharif paidaavaar par mandara rahaa khatra desh main manhagaai ko dastak dene kaa kaam kar sakati he
 It is to be noted that the central government is under pressure due to rising crude oil prices globally and the continuous depreciation of the rupee against the dollar in the international currency market has posed a serious challenge for it
 aise main ab yadi kharif paidaavaar ko nuksaan hota he to chunaavon ke dauraan mahangaai ek bada mudda banakar sarkaar ko gherne kaa kaam karegi
 In such a situation, is the monsoon going to betray the Modi government when it is most in need of a balanced monsoon
 desh main april se may 2019 ke bich aam chunaav karaae jane hai
 While the Modi government has promised to double farmers 'income by 2022 in 2014, the threat of a kharif crop hovering just before the elections can not only reduce farmers' income but also put them under debt burden

 a day before the GST Council meeting on Thursday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAT) has suggested Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 is suzav main kaha gaya he ki anek staron par jiesti lagane ke bajaay keval teen staron par hi jiesti lagaaya jaae
 CAT said that the government's efforts to make GST more simplified are welcome but in this context the decline in GST collection is a matter of concern
 is drushti se kuch aise kadam uthaaye jane bahut jaruri hai jisase vyapaariyon ko tex collection main suvidha ho or sarkaar kaa revenue lakshya hasil ho sake
 The GST collection stood at Rs 94,726 crore in December 2018
 yah collection teen maheenon main sabase kam he
 Let us know that the government is running a target of GST collection of Rs 1 lakh crore every month

 kuldeep ne apni shandaar gugali se maxwell ke stamps uda die

 kuldeep kii gendbaaji dekhakar cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkar bhi unke mureed ho gaye
 Sachin tweeted that 'I am very impressed with Kuldeep's bowling and his debut, keep playing like this, Dharamshala is a chance to shine in the Test' i am impressed with @ imkuldeep18's variations and the way he has started
 Keep going strong, this can be your match to shine
 - sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) March 25, 2017 Kuldeep's strength is his precise line length and amazing control of the ball
 kuldeep ne chinamen ke saath-saath gugali gend kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 Warner and Handscomb dodge several times on his googly, and so did Glenn Maxwell

 But he does not know that 69 percent of the people did not vote for him, then how can you consider him a big victory

 kashmiriyon se baatcheet band na hovhaan ke logon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki kashmir se baatcheet kaa silsilaajab shuru ho to lagaataar jari rahanaa chahie
 Negotiations should not be discontinued
 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi bhi lagaataar baatcheet ke silsile ko jari rakhana chaahate the
 That is why during the Agra talks with Pakistan, he said that you take one step back and one step on Kashmir
 is tarah do kadam jagah hogi baat ke liye
 The trust of Kashmiris needs improvement in governance in central institutions, Kashmir
 kashmiri awam kaa bharosa state se zyada kendriya sansthaanon par he
 Kashmiri believes that there is brotherhood, nepotism and corruption in the state's institutions
 jabaki kendriya sansthaanon main bhrashtachar or bhai-bhatijawad kam he
 Nature Sufism of Kashmir The nature of Kashmir has been Sufism
 sufijya ke maanane vaale dharmanirpekshata main bharosa rakhte hai
 The government should establish Sufijya institutions in Kashmir
 kyonki wahabijm kashmir main apane pair pasaarne kii koshish kar rahaa he, jise sufijm ke jariye counter kiya ja saktaa he
 Kashmir is discriminated against compared to Jammu
 Kashmir feels that there is less development in Kashmir than in Jammu
 centre kii sarkaar jammu kaa zyada fevar karti he
 For this, the voice of Kashmir also speaks
 unka kahana he ki kashmir main koi sarkari project shuru hota he, to kaaphi samay ke baad puraa hota he
 Whether it is a road case or electricity
 jabaki jammu main use samay se pehle puraa kar liya jaataa he
 Not only this, central government institutions are also set up more in Jammu
 kashmir main loktantrkashmiri avam kaa lagata he unke loktantric adhikaron kaa hanan kiya jaataa he
 He feels that the democratic system in India is not in Kashmir
 kashmiri awam kaa maananaa he ki wo apni maangon ko lekar pradarshan karte hai to police un par goli chalaati hai, vahiin haryana or karnataka main log bason ko jala dete hai or hinsak ho jate hai to police unke saath koi kisi tarah kaa hinsak ravaiya nahin akhriyaar karti he

 a girl Pinky and her husband lie wounded on the ground
 unka shikaar karne vaale hai pinki kaa bhai satbir, uskaa mamaa or kuch dost
 Pinky has committed her love marriage against the wishes of the family, against Khap's marriage
 satbir pinki ko maar detaa he or phir uske pati ko goli maarane kii taraf badhata he
 But then his uncle interferes
 wo satbir ke haath main lohe kii rod badhaata he
 Satbir starts attacking the boy with full ferocity and intensity from the rod
 peeche se mamaa kii aawaaj aati he
 This happened to men chhed de
 These bars do not just fall on the boy's body
 shahar, isaki sabhyataa or isaki barabari vaali shuchita par padati he
 At that time, i remember the decorating poster in the frame seen in a shop in Hauz Khas Village
 ye poster ek cigarette kaa vigyaapan he
 Jackie Shroff's cigarette in front of a gray background
 neeche capshan likhaa he
 Men talk
 or phir is baat par aurat ke pratighaat kii laat padati he

 And this is why NH10 becomes a very important film of today
 saghan, rangon kii phiraki se bachi hui, syah, samvedansheel or kuch ek maamalon main saral bhi
 Before listening to the story of NH10, figure out its way
 yah rasta dilli se shuru hota he or bahadurgard, rohtak, sirsa hota hua punjab main pakistan ke border ke paas jaakar khatm hota he
 That is, most of the route passes through Haryana
 ye rajya ek roopak he
 Modern India or India dwells in villages, the seething pot of this duplex
 yahaan padhai he, magar aadhunik chetana nahin, jo langik asamanta ko khaarij karti ho
 You talk about equal rights for everyone
 yahaan kahin krashing bijness, to kahin badhati kancreet colony yani shahar ke pet main samaate khet hai
 But money comes from this process of catering, but the power that comes from spending, spending it, comes to its roots in the same feudal land, where being a woman means to become brittle on its own
 baharhaal, ham kahani samajhate hai
 Meera and Arjun
 pati-patni
 Live in Gurgaon
 naukari karte hai
 One day late at night, Meera has to leave the office
 yahaan vah sadak par ghoomte darindon kaa shikaar hone se bal bal bachati he
 Husband and wife are shaken by this accident
 phir jivan ko phir se sam par laane ke liye ek chuttee plan karte hai
 On the journey, they encounter a hardship
 arjuna dakhal detaa he
 Meera stops
 magar pati ke bheetar mardon vaali baat aa jaati he
 You can also read the matter of cities
 vah haath main pistal lekar gaanv waalon ko kuch tameez sikhaane kaa elaan karata he
 But when he encounters the vassals in his own words, the ground slips under the feet
 iske baad bhagadaudi, bachane, chhipane or mauka lagane par palatwaar karne kaa silsilaa shuru hota he
 After a time, like Mohan's Meera, this Meera's fight also becomes alone
 aakhir main vah bhi mardon ko unheen kii baat main jawaab detii he
 The film NH10 has many specialties
 agar aap google par is film ko search karenge to kai baaten pataa chalengi
 That Falani is inspired by the story from foreign film and its poster from Dhikani film
 bhaiya hamane to zyada phalani dhikaani filmein abhi tak dekhi nahin hai
 But seeing this film, i can say that the story is very real
 film kaa screenple ksaa hua he
 In the first half, the role of confrontation is prepared and in the second, it is taken to the full end
 ekaadh baar gane aate hai, magar vah bhi prishthbhumi main hi
 The film has momentum
 or jahaan kahin ye kuch thaharti bhi he, vahaan cervival ke prayaason ke rang ko bas gadha karne, bheetar tak utarane dene bhar ke liye
 i had been waiting for director Navdeep Singh's second film for a long time
 unki pehali film manorama sicks feet under thi
 It had Abhay Deol, Gul Panag, Raima Sen
 chote bajet kii magar nai tarah kii film thi
 Whoever saw, liked
 ab navdeep enech 10 lekar aae hai
 He has kept every department of the film tight
 film ko bolne bhi diya he or uski chuppi main bhi arthvatta bhari he
 Sometimes this work was done by the camera or, say, the shot, sometimes the dialogues and sometimes only one voice
 ek udhaaharan se samajhate hai
 Meera is running away to escape from Satbir and his companions
 ve stone krashing vaale aria main pahunchate hai
 Meera climbs half up a steep hill
 gunde aakhir main use dekh lete hai or gaaliyon bakate hue us par pathar phenkane lagate hai
 At that time, it seems that the Taliban are throwing stones at a free woman
 magar mira pattharon se beparwaah upar chadhati rahati he
 Reach upstairs gasps and then he also abuses from above and starts throwing stones
 mardon kaa jattha hakkaa bakka rah jaataa he
 Uncle speaks, abuses sister-in-law unke liye yah acolpaneey yaa kahen ki asahneeya prahaar he
 They run away from there
 aakhir main bas unki jagah par ek pathar girtaa he dhapp se
 Here, it is a metaphor for climbing a hill
 samvaad he or aakhir main bas ek aawaaj he
 The story and dialogues of this film have been written by Sudeep Sharma
 sudeep or navdeep ne kai simton main banta kamaal kaa roopak rachaa he
 Through small details, life has been put into development
 masalan, har premi yugal kii ek rahasy bhashaa hoti he
 Which only they both understand
 ye koi jumala, koi gaanaa, koi ishaara ho saktaa he
 In reference to Arjun and Meera, it is a dialogue of a Tamil film seen during the period of fun, which the heroine speaks during Abhisar's request
 mira arjuna ko yah samvaad do baar sunaati he
 Once, when they are sneaking up to go and not to a party
 duusari baar, jab arjuna ko deh kii garmi ko bachaakar rakhane kii jarurat he, taaki sangharsh jari rahe
 The words are the same in both places, but changing the context changes their entire meaning
 sudeep ne kahani ko sanvaadon ke jariye shlesh sundarataa barti he
 Electricity has not reached the water here, what will be the disaster? yaa phir aapaki demokrasi na, gudgaanv ke aakhri mal ke baad khatm ho jaati he
 And this beauty is not just for dialogues
 pratik or bhi kai hai
 As a lone girl wanders the dark streets of the village, she is confronted by a board for help
 us par chamak rahaa he- yahaan garbhpaat kii suvidha he
 Or the narration of the story of Savitri during the Ragini festival in the same village
 jisane apane pati satyawan kii raksha ke liye yama se bhi loha le liya
 Apart from the story, screenplay and dialogue, the fourth shoulder of the film is acting
 sabase shandaar kaam kiya satbir ke role main darshan kumaar ne
 You have seen her earlier in the film Mary Kom as Priyanka Chopra's husband
 theatre becoground se aae darshan ne enech 10 main honor kiling ke naam par apni bahan or uske pati ko maarane nikle satbir naam ke yuva kaa role adaa kiya he
 Satbir does not speak much, but a goth craze is visible in his eyes
 uski deh main vah akad saaf dikhti he
 Which i initially called a manly thing
 arjuna ke role main nil bhoopalam bhi mardon vaali baat, yani juthi akad dikhaane main safal rahe hai
 Anushka is also good with her romantic chemistry
 film kaa sabase zyada focus he iske main kirdaar anoushka par
 Anushka is frozen except for a few scenes in the climax
 aakhir main unke chehre par ek kism kaa shunya najar aata he
 It is possible that the director is trying to show a bit of a coincidence
 jab aap bhavashunya se ho jate hai or usee sanak ke vasheebhoot ho jate hai jisamen sirf ek hi makasad, pratighaat kaa, bas jaataa he
 In the role of Satbir's mother, Deepti Naval has also lent her comfort to a strong mistress of the feudal civilization, the mistress of the house
 film enech 10 ko kai tarah se dekha ja saktaa he
 Right now it rains in Delhi and a lot of people write Vow, It's Raining, Nice Weather type status on Facebook
 unhen nahin pataa ki ye barish fasal ke liye, khet ke liye, kisaan ke liye kisi tabaahi laa rahi he
 It is a cleft
 jiske ek sire par apartment main rahete, shahar main white collar job karata madhyavarg he
 The village, on the other hand, is desperate to become a city, but incompletely
 or in donon ko jodta he ek haive
 The city rides on the highway and the village sits ambush on that highway for its prey
 kabhi ye jameen ke saude ke rup main miltaa he, to kabhi lut ke rup main
 NH10 is also a hoax to rise against masculine thinking
 or is soch kii saleeb ko sirf aadmi hi nahin aurat bhi dhoti hai
 When Satbir beats Meera, her mother says
 ja apni aurat ko bhi leki aa
 Teach him a lesson too
 mira ko lagata he ki jab arjuna uske saath he to use is behad ke jaanwaron se darane kii jarurat bhi nahin or isliye vah phikr mukt ho jaati he
 This is the argument that was being given by the lawyer for the accused of Delhi gang rape a few days ago
 aurat phool he
 Man is a thorn
 uski jimmedaari he phool kii raksha karnaa
 But Meera, during her journey, understands that she is liberated from her own dead and lives only
 is badlaav ko navdeep ne ek achche drishy ke dwaara dikhaaya he
 When Meera takes the watch from Arjun's wrist and wears it on her wrist
 vakt badal gaya he
 Time is in trouble magar vakt ab apane haath main he
 This time you are asking to fight your battle
 is film ko jarur dekhie
 This will give you an urgent fear
 dar jo sabak detaa he
 Fear that gives courage
 ek taraf jahaan 'het story 2' ke geet 'aaj phir tumpe pyaar aayaa he' se darshakon kii vaahvahee bator rahi film kii nayika surveen chawla film main apni maujuudagi ko vishesh banane main juty hai, vahiin apane item number ‘pink lips’ ke jariye sani leone darshakon par apana sikaa jamaana chaahati hai
 Recently, in Mumbai's studio, Sunny shot this item number and if sources are to be believed, Sunny was constantly trying to make this item number warmer than Surveen's song
 sirf yahi nahin unhone pehle hi apni team se yah kah rakhaa tha ki vah is baat kii puri saavdhaanee baraten ki unka yah geet surveen ke geet ‘aaj phir tumpe pyaar aayaa he’ se adhik hot or siowling ho
 For this, Sunny went one step ahead of Surveen through this item number and also served bold scenes to her audience
 surveen se sani kii is takkar main baaji koun martha he yah to khayr aanevaala vakt hi batayega lekin unki is takkar se darshakon ko kaaphi phayda honevaala he

 Now the next injury will be on those who harm the country's economy through fake currency, who are constantly changing their strategy
 desh ke dushmano kii ore se ab tak amuman 500 or 1000 rupye kenkali notahi utaar kar arthvyavastha ko nishaanaa banaaya jaataa tha
 But after the 500 and 1000 rupee notes are closed, even those running fake currency are forced to change the strategy
 vitt mantralay ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki ab chote mulya ke noton jaise ki 100, 50, 20 or 10 rupye ke nakli note aane kaa khatra bad gaya he
 a highly placed source of the finance ministry said, 'the new notes of 500 and 2000 have new security features which are not easy to copy
 lekin shaatir tatv ab chote mulya ke nakli note utaar sakate hai
 Recently, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data kept in the Lok Sabha, 26 lakh fake notes of 500 and 1000 came in the hold of RBI in the last four years
 inkaa mulya 167 karod rupye baithta he
 18 in caught fake notes
 9 lakh 500 ke or 7
 6 lakhs were for 1000 rupees
 sutron ke mutabik ab chote mulya ke nakli note utaare jate hai to ye jaanch agenciyon ke liye nai chunauti hoga
 The borders of Nepal and Bangladesh still remain the most dangerous zones for fake currency infiltration in the country
 rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) kii forensik report main ullekh he ki nakli bhartiya karency note (FICN) ko pakistan main ati aadhunik mashiinon par kiya jaataa he
 It also costs a hefty cost
 isliye ab nakli karency ke centre bharat main notebandi se hue nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye din-raat jute hue hai
 a highly placed source of the Finance Ministry said that wherever Indian fake currency is printed including Pakistan, it will not be possible for them to copy the security features of the new 500 and 2000 notes for years
 aise main pakistan chote mulya vaale bhartiya karency ke nakli note chhapane par jor degaa
 RBI is also well aware of this danger
 isiilie RBI kii ore se elaan kiya gaya he ki chote mulya ke noton kii nai siries bhi jari kii jaaegi jisamen alag inset number honge
 The Crime Branch of Delhi Police has planned to launch a special campaign for the liberation of minor girls trapped in the morass of other sex trade bases and networks in the red light areas running in the capital
 child welfare kamity (CWC) ke nirdesh par yah karrwai kii ja rahi he
 The crime branch will investigate every person connected to the Red Light area and other sex trade bases located in the capital
 har mahila ke ghar, parivaar, umr kii list taiyaar kii jaaegi
 a list of how many years those women and girls have been in the red light areas will also be prepared
 krime branch kii jaanch ke daayre main red lite aria or deh vyapaar ke daldal main fansi naaballig ladkiyaan va bachche honge
 He has been instructed to prepare a separate list
 list main unki umr ke pramaan ke saath yah bhi darj karnaa hoga ki unamem aids yaa echivi jaise yon sankraman kii shikaar kitne hai va kitni garbhvatee ho chuki hai
 The CWC has issued instructions in this regard to other police officers including the Delhi Police Commissioner
 CWC ne krime branch se is par 28 disambar tak acshan teken report bhi maangi he
 The Delhi Women's Commission (DCW) says that the CWC directive is more important in relation to the red light area located on GB Road
 DCW ke anusaar, GB road red lite aria main maanav taskari kar desh ke vibhinn hisson se naaballig ladkiyaan laai jaati hai or unhen vaishyavriti ke daldal main dhakel diya jaataa he
 Not only this, minors are argued to prove that they are doing prostitution on their own
 is aad main police bhi acshan lene se bachati rahi he
 This complete information and list collected by the CWC from the capital's red light areas and body trade bases will be matched with cases of kidnapping and disappearance
 CWC kaa maananaa he ki chakalagharon par rahane vaale naaballigon main yon sankraman, nashe kii lat, bachapan khone, shiksha se vanchit rahane, pratadna or unki jindagi tak ko khatra rahata he
 Therefore, the Crime Branch has been directed to gather all the information about them
 taaki police dwaara taiyaar list ke aadhaar par agala kadam uthaaya ja sake
 DCW is also continuously working in this direction
 mahila ayog kaa kahana he ki na sirf red lite aria hi nahin balki un sansthaanon ko bhi jaanch ke daayre main laana chahie, jahaan par mahilaon va bacchiyon ke shoshan or maanav taskari kii ashanka rahati he
 According to the Women's Commission, the body trade is going on in the open road on GB Road, where there is a police station at 100 meters
 agar vahaan se ladakiyon ko mukt karavaaya jaataa he to 17 main 14 ladakiyon ko waapas usee daldal main bhej diya jaataa he
 This is a big rigging of the system
 vahaan bahut choti bacchiyaan bhi hai
 After removing them from there, it is very important to do the counseling, so that it can be known that under which circumstances it got trapped in this swamp

 The Indian team has been playing continuously since the Champions Trophy in England and the team management is adopting a rotation policy to keep players from fatigue
 lekin kohli lagaataar sabhi formet main khel rahe hai
 Assuming that Kohli will play in all three odis against New Zealand and by then, the Indian captain will have three Tests, 23 odis and three T20 matches since June 2017
 agar kohli ko srilanka ke khilaaf test siries dhyaan main rakhkar tii20 siries se aaraam diya jaataa he to phir rohit sharma team kii captaini karenge

 He was not picked in three consecutive series of limited overs against Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand
 chayankartaaon ne pehle kaha tha ki aswin or jadeja ko aaraam diya gaya he
 But Ashwin, meanwhile, played six first-class matches, including four counties and two Ranji matches
 jadeja ne keval ek match saurashtra kii taraf se khelaa or unhone doharaa shatak jadne ke alaava saat wicket bhi liye
 There may be some changes in the T20 squad keeping in mind the rotation policy
 ashish nehra dilli main ek november ko pehle tii-20 match ke baad sanyas le lenge
 He can be replaced by Jaydev Unadkat or Basil Thampi in the squad for the next two matches
 yah dekhnaa hoga ki limited overon kii cricket main lagaataar khel rahe bhubaneshwar kumaar ko aaraam diya jaataa he yaa nahin

 mudde hai, naare hai, daanv-pench hai par is sabake bich sabake dimag main sawaal yahi he ki aakhir kis karavat baithegaa siyasat kaa oont
 Aaj Tak will answer this
 india today oarji opinian pole se saaf hui he tamaam sawaalon ko lekar desh kii tasviir
 By quoting 17 questions, we tell you what the country is thinking
 pehla sawaal he agar aaj chunaav ho jaaen to koun sa gathbandhan kis haalat main hoga
 The answer is shocking
 upie kii siten hai 168 se 178 jabaki 2009 main unki siten thim 259
 NDA seats are 180 to 190 while in 2009 there were 159 seats
 india today oarji opinian pole kaa doosraa sawaal tha ki agar aaj chunaav hon to congress or bijepi main se kiski siten zyada hongin
 The nation's answer is 108 to Congress, whereas in 2009 it was 207
 bijepi ko 140, jabaki 2009 main thim 115
 That is, it is clear that the country has lost confidence in the Congress leading the UPA alliance
 india-today oarji pole survey main aglaa sawaal tha desh main piem ke taur par pehali pasand koun he
 We tell you the mood of the country
 narendra modi 24 fisadi ke saath number van hai
 Rahul Gandhi was number two with 17 percent
 10 fisadi ke saath adwani number teen rahe, jabaki manmohan singh or sonia ko chaahane waalon kii taadaad bhi 10 fisadi ke aasapaas hi rahi
 Nitish Kumar's choice percentage was 5 percent
 ajtak-oarji survey main aglaa sawaal tha ki 2014 main kis party kaa netaa piem kii gaddi par baithegaa to jawaab hairat vaala mila
 The country believes that this time the PM will not be from Congress nor BJP, but any big leader of other parties will sit on the throne of PM, but he will not be as weak as Deve Gowda and Gujral
 india today oarji pole survey main aglaa sawaal tha pradesh main best siem koun he
 So in this survey of 19 states, it was revealed that Narendra Modi is number one, Nitish Kumar number two, Mamta Banerjee number three, Sheela Dixit is number four while Mayawatki is number five
 yani congress kaa ek siem hi top five main aayaa he
 The next question in the India Today ORG Poll survey was who is the role model of the country
 jawaab behad chaukaaney vaala rahaa
 Especially for those people who are going after the battle and existence of Anna Hazare
 jawaab he anna hajaare 14 fisadi logon kii najar main desh ke sarvocch role model hai, jabik sachin tendulkar 6 fisadi ke saath duusare number par hai or rahul gandhi 4 fisadi ke saath tisare number par hai
 The biggest question of the country, when the search for inflation was discovered in 19 states of India in the India Today ORG Poll survey, it was found that 37 percent people of the country blame Manmohan Singh on inflation, while Pranab Mukherjee is 24 percent and Sharad Pawar
 16 percent of the people blame it
 survey main hamane jaananaa chaha ki aakhir desh kii samasuaaon ko sulajhane main kis dal par desh kaa bharosa he, to logon kaa jawaab tha ki bijepi sabase sakasham he 35 fisadi ke saath jabaki gaiyr upie or gaiyr endie dal desh kii samasya kaa behatar samaadhaan de sakane kii sthiti 32 fisadi logon ko sahi lagi
 Whereas only 26 percent people trusted the Congress
 survey main jab poocha gaya ki bhrashtachar kii samasya se desh ko koun sa dal nijaat dilaa saktaa he to 35 fisadi logon ne mana ki gaiyr upie or endie dalon main ye kshamta he, jabaki bijepi par 33 fisadi logon ne bharosa jataayaa
 Only 25 per cent of the people considered the Congress right for this task
 survey ke dauraan jab sawaal poocha gaya he ki garibon ke bare main soch kar satta chalaane vaale dalon main sabase upar koun to desh kaa jawaab chaukaaney vaala tha
 Thirty-five percent of our sample size believed that the policies of non-nda and non-upa parties were in favor of the poor, while 31 percent expressed confidence in the BJP and only 26 percent voted on the Congress
 india today-oarji pole survey main desh ke 19 rajyon main 12 hajaar 648 logon se jab ye poocha gaya ki wo sonia ke baad congress ke adhyaksh ke taur par kise dekhnaa chaahate hai to unamem se 59 fisadi logon ne rahul ko sahi uttaradhikari qaraar diya

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its leaders during a discussion on the confidence motion in the Bihar Assembly
 nitish ne samaveshi niti kii vakaalat kii or spasht kiya ki yah desh corporate jagat se udayi gai hawa se nahin chalegaa
 The Chief Minister said that the truth which the BJP was not able to demonstrate publicly till now, it was displayed in the House today
 mukhyamantri ne sadan main kaha ki bihar bhaajapa main bahari tatwon kaa pravesh hone laga tha, jisase gathbandhan chalaanaa sambhav nahin tha
 There were attempts to impose principles on us
 nitish ne spasht shabdon main kaha ki hamaara desh or samaaj vividhtaon se bharaa he
 There is a need for inclusive policy
 yahi hamaara sidghant he, or niti bhi he
 We cannot separate from this
 unhone kaha ki hamane bahut pehle hi bhaajapa se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main spasht karne ke liye kaha tha, parantu har samay is mudde ko taal diya gaya
 He said that when we joined the BJP alliance, it was the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani
 us samay jad(you) ne sabhi vivaadaaspad muddon par apana najariya spasht kar diya tha
 But now the BJP was withdrawing from those issues in the new era, due to which it was forced to decide to break away from the coalition
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister indirectly criticized Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and said that today the country will not run with the wind blowing from the corporate world
 desh sabhi ko saath lekar chalane vaali niti se aage badhegaa
 If inclusive air was stopped today, the country would disintegrate
 unhone kaha ki aaj log samaj rahe hai ki kisi khaas vyakti ke paksh main desh main hawa chal rahi he, parantu yah bhram he
 Nitish resorted to a lion to express his feelings: 'I have come again and again the message of Amir, hum se na ho sauda jamir ka'
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bhaajapa ab tak jis sach kaa pradarshan saarvajanik rup se nahin kar paa rahi thi, use aaj usne sadan main pradarshit kar diya
 The Chief Minister said in the House that external elements had started entering the Bihar BJP, so it was not possible to run an alliance
 ham par sidghanton ko thope jane kii koshishen hone lagi thim
 Nitish said clearly that our country and society is full of diversities
 yahaan samaveshi niti kii jarurat he
 This is our principle, and so is policy
 isse ham alag nahin ho sakate
 He said that we had long ago asked the BJP to clarify about the prime ministerial candidate, but this issue was deferred all the time
 unhone kaha ki jab ham bhaajapa gathbandhan main shaamil hue the, tab atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani kaa jamaana tha
 At that time, JD (U) had made its stand clear on all controversial issues
 parantu ab bhaajapa nae yug main un muddon se peeche hatane lagi thi, jiske kaaran majaburi main gathbandhan se alag hone kaa faisla karnaa padaa
 The comments mukhyamantri ne paroksh rup se gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki aaj desh corporate jagat kii ore se udayi gai hawa se nahin chalegaa
 The country will move ahead with the policy that keeps everyone together
 agar aaj samaveshi hawa ko roka gaya, to desh bikhar jayega
 He said that today people are understanding that the wind is blowing in the country in favor of a particular person, but this is an illusion
 nitish ne apni bhaawanaaon ko jaahir karne ke liye ek sher kaa sahaara liya : 'aayaa to baar-baar sandesh amir kaa, hamase naa ho sakaa sauda jameer kaa'

 unhone kataaksh kiya, 'modi jab france main rafel yudhak vimaan kharid rahe the, tab bharat ke raksha mantri goa main machhlee kharid rahe the
 He also claimed that the home minister of the country, Rajnath Singh, was not able to send any file directly to the Prime Minister's Office, thereby reducing the dignity of the post of Home Minister

 Digvijay said in the presence of Union Steel and Mines Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, 'the central government also has the legal power to decide where the mineral extracted from a coal block will be used
 aakhir yah baat tay karne vaala centre koun hota he
 The mineral wealth emanating from the coal block should be owned by the state
 ' Digvijay told reporters in Indore, 'vault runs with Modi on foreign trips

 Big industrialists also walk
 ye udyogpati unki tijori hai

 20 agast yani purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kaa janmdin lekin desh ne 21 may 1991 ko rajeev gandhi ko vakt se pehle kho diya tha
 Rajiv Gandhi was killed in a blast in Sriperbudur, you all know this, but we will tell you when, how, where and who carried out this biggest conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi
 jafana,srilanka (november 1990)ghaney jangalon ke bich ek aatanki thikaane main prabhakaran baitha tha
 Four of his companions were sitting with him
 baby subrahmanyam, muthuraja, murugan or shivarasana
 a big conspiracy was being formed
 ghanton tanaav ke bich chali baithak
 Every man was putting his side
 behad gopneey is baithak main tanaav itnaa tha ki hawa bhi bam kii aawaaj kii tarah lag rahi thi
 Between the humidity and the heat, Prabhakaran was listening and weaving very fast
 aakhir sajeesh puri ho gai
 Prabhakaran approved the plan of Rajiv Gandhi's death
 plan ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari chaar logon ko saunpi gai
 Baby Subrahmanyam- LTTE ideologue, hideout for attackers
 muthuraja- prabhakaran kaa khaas, hamalaavaronke liye sanchaar or paise kii jimmedaari
 Murugan - Explosive expert, Terrorist, Arrangement of funds and money for the attack
 shivarasana- littey kaa jasoos, visphotak visheshgy, rajeev gandhi kihatya kii puri jimmedaari
 Baby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja arrived in Chennai in early 1991 after taking orders from the world's most feared terrorist Prabhakaran to assassinate Rajiv
 inke jimme tha behad ahm or shuruuaati kaam
 Baby and Muthuraj had to prepare people in Chennai who, despite being unaware of the purpose, help the death squads
 khaastaur par rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ke liye hatya se pehle rukne kaa ghar den or hatya ke baad chhipane kaa thikaana
 Baby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja reached Shubha News Photo Agency directly in Chennai
 agency kaa maalik shubha subrahmanyam ilam samarthak tha
 Shubha Subrahmanyam had the help of both of them before Baby and Muthuraja arrived
 shubha ko sajeesh ke liye local saport muhaiyaa karana tha
 Arriving here, Baby and Muthuraja started working differently according to their respective targets
 baby subrahmanyam ne sabase pehle shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale bhagyanathan ko apane changul main fansaaya
 Nalini, who is serving a sentence in the Rajiv murder case, is the sister of this Bhagyanathan who used to work in a printing press
 bhagyanathan or nalini kii maa nurse thi
 The nurse mother had to vacate the house she got from the hospital at the same time
 mushkil halaat main ghire bhagyanathan or nalini koatanki baby ne paise or madad ke jhaanse main liya
 Baby sold a printing press to Bhagyanathan cheaply
 isse parivaar sadak par aane se batch gaya
 Nalini and Bhagyanathan in turn became Baby's pawns
 sajeesh kaa pehla charan tha samarthakon kaa network bananaa jo shaatir dimaagon main band sajeesh ko dhire-dhire anjaam tak pahunchane main madadgaar sabit hon par bina kuch jane
 While Baby Subrahmanyam was making safe havens to live in Chennai, Muthuraja was very viciously picking people for his brutal plot
 chennai kii shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale in shaitanon ke liye vardaan ban gaye the
 It was from here that Muthuraja selected two photographers Ravi Shankaran and Haribabu
 ravishankaran or haribabu dono shubha news photocopy agency main bataur photographer kaam karte the
 Haribabu was fired
 muthuraja nehribabu kovigyaneshwar agency main naukari dilaai
 Called a man named Balan from Sri Lanka and made Haribabu's protégé
 isse haribabu ko kaaphi paisa milane laga or uskaa jhukaavamuthuraja kii taraf badhane laga
 Muthuraja, under the burden of Ahsan, provoked Haribabu against Rajiv Gandhi so much that the Tamils would suffer further if they came to power in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections
 rajeev kii hatya ke liye sajeesh kii ek ek eent jodi ja rahi thi
 Sitting in Sri Lanka, Murugan meanwhile sent Jai Kumaran and Robert Payas to Chennai
 ye donon purur ke saviri nagar ekstansion memruke
 Jayakumaran's brother-in-law LTTE bomb expert Ariwayu Perulibalan had been hiding since 1990
 in donon ko srilanka se chennai bhejne kaa makasad thnorse sechupchaap pade computer ejeeniyar or electronic expareriveyu perulibalan ko sajeesh main shaamil karnaa taaki wo hatya kaa aujaar bam bana sake
 Later, Porur's house became the headquarters of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination plan
 yaheen se chalakar puri sajeesh shreeperambdur tak pahunchi thi
 The vicious mastermind was also creating fierce hatred against Rajiv Gandhi in the mind of every person who joined
 unhen pataa tha ki bhayankar nafrat ke bina bheeshan ghinauni sajeesh anjaam tak nahin pahonchegi
 When Baby and Muthuraja added their four people, Murugan's entry into the plot took place
 murugan ne chennai pahunch kar bahutaraftaar mensajeesh ko anjaam kii ore laane kii koshishen tej kin
 Jayakumaran and Pius at the behest of Murugan
 nalini-bhagyanathan-baby-muthuraja ke thikaane par pahunch gaye
 anti-rajiv Gandhi sentiments began to fill the minds of the people
 nalini rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf puri tarah taiyaar ho gayi thi
 Satanic Forces, a book printed in the printing press in which Nalini used to work, played an important role in her brainwash
 brinwash ke saath murugan ne hatyaron kii nakli pahchaan taiyaar karne ke liye jayakumaran or paayas kii madad se farji driving license banwaaya
 Murugan, Muthuraja and Baby together find three safe hideouts in Chennai to hide
 araviyu ke taur par ek bam banane vaala taiyaar tha
 Hate of Nalini Padma and Bhagyanathan was ready against Rajiv
 shubha subrahmanyam jaisaa aadmi muhaiyaa karaane vaala taiyaar tha
 Now a message was sent to Sivarasan
 march kii shuruuaat main wo samudr ke raste chennai pahunchaa
 He stopped at Payas's house in the same area of porur
 porur hi rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii sajeesh kaa controlroom ban gaya
 As soon as Shivarasan reached Porur, the trap of the conspiracy of the forests of Jaffna was completed
 shivarasana ne kaman apane haath main le lee
 Baby and Muthuraj were sent back to Sri Lanka
 chennai main nalni,murugan or bhagyanathan ke saath shivarasana ne maanavbam khoja par wo nahin mila
 Sivarasan checked Arivayu Peruli Balan's bomb design, Sivarasan himself was a good explosive expert
 sari taiyaari ko mukammal dekh maanavbam ke itanjam main shivarasana phir samudr ke raste jafana waapas gaya vahaan wo prabhakaran se mila
 He told Prabhakaran that Manavam is not available in India
 isapar prabhakaran ne shivarasana kii chacheri bahanon dhanu or shubha ko uske saath bharat ke liye ravaanaa kar diya
 Sivarasan arrived in Chennai in early April carrying Dhanu and Shubha
 dhanu or shubha ko wo nalini ke ghar le gaya
 Murugan was already present here
 shivarasana ne behad shaatir tareeke se paayas- jayakumaran-bam dijainer arivu ko inase alag rakhaa or khud porur ke thikaane main rahata rahaa
 He instructed everyone from time to time to take correct action
 ab chennai ke teen thikaanon main rajeev gandhi hatyakand kii sajeesh chal rahi thi
 Sivarasan asked bomb expert Aivu to make a bomb that could be tied to the woman's waist without revealing the target
 shivarasana ke kehane par arivu ne ek aisi belt dizin kii jisamen chah ardex bhare grenade jamaaye ja sake
 Eighty grams of Seafour audix were loaded in each grenade
 har grenade main do mili meter ke do hajaar aath sau spellinter hon
 All grenades were added parallel with the help of silver wire
 circuit ko puraa karne ke liye do switch lagaae gaye
 One of these was to prepare the switch bomb and the other to detonate it and a 9 mm battery was installed to charge the entire bomb
 grenade main jamaa kiye gaye sprinter kam se kam visphotak main 5000 meter pratisecond kii raftaar se baahar nikalate yani har sprinter ek goli ban gaya tha
 The bomb was designed in such a way that the target could not survive if the explosion was as low as the RDX and the same happened
 ab shivarasana ke haath main bam bhi tha or bam ko anjaam tak pahunchane vaali maanavbam dhanu bhi
 It was just a matter of Rajiv Gandhi, but before that he wanted to try his conspiracy by hammering
 aaj tak ke paas 1991 main aamchunaavon ke dauraan chennai ke marina bich main hui raily kaa video he
 In this video, Sivarasan can be seen at a distance of just 25-30 feet from his target Rajiv Gandhi
 jayalalita or rajeev kii is raily main shivarasana rajeev kii suraksha kaa jayja lene pahunchaa tha
 Here he realized the flaws of Rajiv's public meeting and poor security, but one-day Jack Sivarasan did not stop here
 is raily ke anubhav ko pakkaa karne ke liye wo ek or siyaasi raily main maanavbam dhanu ko saath lekar pahunchaa
 On 12 May 1991, shivarasan-dhanu performed the final Reiki at the rally of former PM VP Singh and DMK supremo Karunanidhi
 tiruvallur ke arkonam main hui is raily main dhanu veepi singh ke behad paas tak pahunchi usne unke pair bhi chhue
 Just did not press the button of the bomb
 purv pradhanmantri veepi singh kii raily main suraksha kaa str rajeev kii suraksha ke baraabar na sahi to kam bhi nahin tha par shivarasana or dhanu ke shaatir iraade kaamyaab rahe
 This boosted Sivarasan's spirits and he saw his plan succeeding
 loksabhaa chunaav kaa daur tha rajeev gandhi kii meeting 21 may ko shreeperambdur main tay ho gai
 Shivarasan decided in a blink of an eye that the plot would be completed on 21st
 20 kii raat shivarasana nalini ke ghar ralike vigyaapan valvekhbaar lekar pahunchaa or tay ho gaya ki ab 21 ko hi sajeesh puri hogi
 Dhanu wore glasses to trick security agencies for the first time on the night of 20 May at Nalini's house
 shubha ne dhaanu ko belt pahana kar practice karwaai or shreeperambdur main kis tarah sajeesh ko anjaam tak pahunchaana he isaki puri taiyaari mukammal kar lee gai
 All were completely calm and ready for the cause
 20 may kii raat ko sabhi ne saath milakar film dekhi or so gaye
 In the morning, five people were ready to complete the shivarasan-dhanu-shubha-nalini and Haribabu plot
 shreeperambdur main raily kii gahamagahami thi
 Rajiv Gandhi's arrival was delayed
 baar-baar elaan ho rahaa tha ki rajeev kisi bhi vakt raily ke liye pahunch sakate hai
 The plot that had been brewing for the last six months was very close to its end
 ek mahila sab inspector ne use doorrahane ko kaha par rajeev gandhi ne use rokte hue kaha ki sabko paas aane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 They did not know that they were calling the death not the public
 nalini ne maala pahanaai, pair chune ke lietuki or bas sajeesh puri ho gai
 Sivarasan ran towards Chennai soon after the blast
 nalini or sudhaa usase chennai main aakar mili
 There Sivarasan told Sudha that Haribabu was killed but his camera was lying there
 shivarasana ne sundaram ko haribabu kaa camera maukey se udaane kii jimmedaari saunpi
 Sundaram tried hard but failed and then the photographs captured in that camera roll gave the clues that led Rajiv's killers to the clutches of the investigation team
 suraksha main khami thi, ye sach he par usase bada sach ye he ki aakhir littey rajeev gandhi ko maarane ke liye is kadar utaaru kyon tha
 Its answer and clues tell you
 pradhanmantri banane ke teen saal ke bheetar srilankai grihayuddh khatm karne ke liye rajeev gandhi ne srilanka ke raashtrapati je aar jayavardhane ke saath ek shanti samjhauta kiya
 In this, the Indian Peace Keeping Force had to restore peace by putting weapons of LTTE and other Tamil terrorists, but the stance backfired
 littey ne samjhaute kii peeth par khanjar bhonk diya
 The evening of the settlement, Sri Lankan naval Vijitha Rohana attacked Rajiv Gandhi
 vijitha ne bandook kii bat rajeev par de maari
 If he had a broom, he would have killed him too
 bal-bal batch gaye the rajeev
 Had there been a gunshot, Rajiv Gandhi probably would not have survived the same day
 saaf tha samjhaute ne srilankai tamilon main rajeev gandhi ke prati nafrat bhar di thi
 Meanwhile, in 1988, Rajiv Gandhi thwarted the coup attempt of the Tamil organization PLOTE in Maldives by sending the Indian Army
 tamil aatankiyon main ise lekar bhi khaasi naaraazgi thi
 As a result, Prabhakaran killed Rajiv Gandhi soon after the Indian Peace Keeping Force's full withdrawal from Sri Lanka in 1990
 halaki littey apane upar lage aaropon se inkaar karata aayaa he
 It is said that the greatest security ends where someone is bent on sacrificing his life
 rajeev gandhi hatyakand main bhi aisa hua
 Manavam's bet was very big and serious
 baavjood iske aakhir chook hui to kyon
 Rajiv Gandhi was surrounded by terrible dangers
 phir tashtaree main paros kar unki jaan aakhir kyon aatankiyon ke saamne rakh di gai
 If the head of the investigation team is to be believed, then the Central Government had no idea who killed Rajiv
 baavjood iske ki chennai or jafana ke bich chal rahe sandeshon main ek bhartiya netaa kii hatya kii sajeesh pakad lee gai thi
 Apart from this, the IB and the Ministry of Home Affairs were also issuing an alert regarding Rajiv's safety, but Rajiv's life was left in the trust of two sub-inspectors of Delhi Police
 1984 main aitihaasik jeet darj karne vaale rajeev ko 1989 main karaari shikast ne sadamein main daal diya tha
 Rajiv felt that his distance from the public was driving him away from power
 lihaaja wo 1991 ke chunaav main janata se judaav ko hi apni pahchaan bana rahe the
 He would go more and more among the public
 suraksha jahaan aade aati use fatkaar dete
 Those who say this also say that Rajiv Gandhi got some police officers of UP transferred because Rajiv was extremely angry with their security
 rajeev se jab log aise jokhim na uthaane ko kehete to unka jawaab hota, 'main janata par avishvaas nahin kar saktaa, main kab tak suraksha kii chintaa karuunga, muje jindagi jini he
 'but Rajiv may have forgotten that being alive is the first and last condition for cultivating the love of the public
 rajeev apni jind par ade rahe, suraksha ko dhata bataa rahe or dushman bhi apni jid par ada rahaa
 The assassination of Rajiv in Sriperumbudur brings out a major irony in Indian politics
 netaaon se ummid hoti he ki wo janata ke bich jaaen, unhen samajhen jane par rajeev gandhi kaa janata se pyaar hi unki maut kii vajah ban gaya
 Default in security was considered to be the biggest reason in Rajiv's murder and these lapses occurred due to Rajiv's security break reaching the public
 gujarat chunaav se pehle patidaar samudaay ko saadhane kii koshishon main juty congress ne unhen aarakshan dene kaa nayaa formula rakhaa he
 The Gujarat Congress, after talking to senior leader and lawyer Kapil Sibal, proposed a new quota to the Patidars under Articles 31 and 38 (2) of the Constitution, though it would not be within the 49 per cent quota prescribed for the reserved category
 angreji akhbaar times of india ne congress se jude sutron ke hawaale se bataaya, 'anuchhed 31 ke tahat aise praavdhaan die gaye hai
 Accordingly, the state government can bring any law to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities
 ise court main chunauti nahin di ja sakati
 "we have made it very clear that we will not tamper with the existing limit of 49% quota prescribed for SC, ST and OBC classes, but will provide additional protection of 20% by introducing a new law," sources said
 'sutron ne kaha ki nae aarakshan kaa yah prastaav jati aadhaarit nahin, balki aavashyaktaa aadhaarit hoga
 There will be benefits like OBC reservation and Patidars will also benefit from it
 vahiin is bare main gujarat congress adhyaksh bharatsingh solanki se jab baat kii gai, to unhon kaha, 'kapil sibbal ji ne kai vikalp sujhaaye hai, jiske tahat patidaaron or duusare samudaayon ko aarakshan kaa laabh diya ja saktaa he
 Another Congress source says that the Patidar Amanat Andolan Samiti (PASS) led by Hardik Patel has expressed satisfaction over our proposal, but he said that after first taking opinion from leaders and legal experts of his community including Hardik Patel He will take a decision on this
