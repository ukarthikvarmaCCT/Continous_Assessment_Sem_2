 Rahul Gandhi's statement is absolutely condemnable! He is nowhere close to even a single good deed of Veer Savarkar & his greatness
 Not just this,he should not even do the blunder of considering himself as ‘gandhi'!one cannot become ‘gandhi'by just keeping his surname as gandhi!sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena on opposition parties delegation to meet the President over # citizenshipamendmentact: i do not know about it

 As the Lok Sabha elections are drawing closer, the rhetoric between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena is becoming increasingly bitter

 Thackeray's statement is believed to be a response to Amit Shah's remarks in which he had spoken of throwing out former allies in the event of no alliance
 bayaan kii aalochana karte hue thakare ne kaha ki maine kisi se 'patake denge' jaise shabd sune hai
 The one who defeated the Shiv Sena is not yet born
 bataa den ki shivasena centre or maharashtra kii sarkaron main bhaajapa kii sahyogi he
 BJP president Amit Shah, who visited Maharashtra in early January, had said in Latur that if there is an alliance, the BJP will ensure the victory of its allies, but if it does not, the 2019 elections will defeat the BJP its old allies
 shah ne aise sahyogiyon ko patake dene kii baat bhi kahi thi
 However, he did not name Shiv Sena
 ab uddhav thakare ke bayaan ko shah kii tippanee ke jawaab ke rup main hi dekha ja rahaa he
 Modi wave also commented Uddhav Thackeray said this while addressing a public meeting in Worli area
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle modi lahar par nishaanaa sadhate hue thakare ne kaha, 'shivasena ne apni yatra main kai lehren dekhi hai

 thakare ne kaha, 'hamen bataaie ki congress kis prakaar mandir nirmaan main baadha daal rahi he
 The Congress got the result of its actions in 2014
 party ko loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa bhi pad nahin mil sakaa
 He questioned how bjp's allied parties like Nitish Kumar's JDU and Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP are opposing the construction of the temple
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ko is par sthiti spasht kerani chahie

 When asked about this, Bandopadhyay said, 'the appropriate decision will be taken at the appropriate time
 ’unhone kaha ki unki party koyala block aavanton par kaig kii report par bhi sarkaar ko gheregi
 Not agreeing with the disruptions in Parliament, Bandopadhyay said, "around 80 percent of the time in the last monsoon session was wasted due to disruptions in Parliament
" ’unhone kaha ki sansad main aam aadmi ko prabhavit karne vaale muddon par vichaar vimarsh sakriyata se hona chahie
 When the Trinamool MP was asked if he would hold the BJP responsible for the blockade in Parliament, he said, 'congress also adopted this kind of policy many times during the NDA government
 isliye donon bade dalon ko iske liye jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 He claimed that the Trinamool Congress has proved that when the interests of the common man are being affected by the policies of the Center, the party did not worry about the post of minister

 Let us tell you, the diploma in engineering qualification was fixed for all these posts
 lekin mahila B
 e are graduates
 CMRL vigyaapan kaa ullekh karte hue, nyaayadhish ne kaha ki jin ummidavaaron kii yogyata kisi pad ke liye aavashyaktaa se adhik he, ve us pad par aavedan karne ke yogya nahin maane jaaenge
 Further, he said that clear instructions were given for the post, in which "minimum qualification is clearly stated and it has been written that candidates with higher qualifications cannot apply"
 aapako bataa den, mahila ne 1 farvari, 2013 ko chennai metro rail limited (CMRL) main train oparation, stesan controlar, junior ejeeniyar (stesan) ke padon ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 He successfully passed the online examination held on 31 March 2013

 jis samay unhone chennai metro rail limited (CMRL) padon ke liye aavedan kiya tha, us samay unke paas koi degree nahin thi

 mahila ne aage tark diya ki usne apni ejineering kii degree se sambandhit kisi bhi jaankaree ko dabaaya nahin tha or isliye, niyukti ke liye uski ummidavaari par vichaar kiya janaa chahie

 Even before making the Bharat Bandh a success, most parties have made a safe distance that Vonotbandi is with the Bharat Bandh, but the bandh will not stop everything

 Shahrukh Khan's 'zero' flop will be like this, no one would have expected it
 shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan) or aamir khan (aamir Khan) ke liye 2018 acha nahin rahaa he
 Shah Rukh Khan's "zero" was seen gasping at the box office, so Aamir Khan's 'thugs of Hindostan' faced a similar fate and the film is not doing well in China either
 vaise shahrukh khan ne 'jiro' ke jhatse ubarte hue, apni agali film 'saare jahaan se acha' par focus karne kaa faisla liya he

 haryana ke mevaat kii biryani dur-dur tak mashhoor he
 During Eid, people turn to Mewat from afar to eat this biryani
 lekin abaki baar ye biryani rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke gale main atak kar rah gai he
 When the Gaurakshak government got the news of going to Birpani in Birpani, samples were picked up from seven shops serving Biryani and sent to the laboratory of one of the state's own universities Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar for examination
 maze kii baat ye he kii sarkaar vishvavidhyalay kii report par koi karwai karti isse pehle hi uniwarsity ke ek aalaa adhikari ne sarkaar se ye kah kar tahalaka machaa diya tha kii cemple positive hai
 There is no meat beef found in Biryani, where the state police and officials of the Hariyanagousseva Commission remain unaware of this report and are talking about not getting the report, while the investigating university officials are claiming to submit the report to the government
 sarkari sutron ke mutabik report anadhikrut taur par li ho chuki he or kai vibhaagon ke paas maujuud he
 In this report, there is talk of getting meat in Biryani but there is no mention of Beef in it
 report main sirf 'kaital meet' yani maveshi kaa maance he yani saaf nahin he kii sample main bif tha
 Government does not want to make the report public The Manohar Lal Khattar government of the state has kept silence on the matter even fifteen days after the report came
 sutron kii maane to sarkaar par is report ko saarvajanik na karne or is maamle ko zyaada tool na dene kaa davaav he
 The central government does not want much agitation over the beef dispute
 sutron kii maane to sarkaar is vivaad se bachanaa chaahati he
 a major reason for the government's silence is also the disqualification of the departments and their officials who did not have the right to take samples legally
 sarkaar par saadhe gaye kai sawalkul mila kar puraa vivaad chaay kii pyaali me aae tufaan kii tarah sabit hua he
 Neither the government was able to prove that there was beef in the biryani, nor did it have the answers to the questions that were asked by those thousands of biryani eaters during the festival as to why questions were raised about their food in the name of cow protection
 haryana main gauvadh or gaumance par purna pabandipurv cabinet mantri or congress netaa aftab ahamed ne beef vivaad ko lekar sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa kar diya he
 He has alleged that the state government unnecessarily tried to disturb the festival of Eid by fueling the dispute
 ek ore jahaan namoonay sehat mahakme dwaara liye jane chahie the vahiin unki jaanch kisi manyata praapt lab main kii jaani chahie thi
 It is worth noting that the BJP government of Haryana had imposed the complete ban on cow slaughter and beef in the state by implementing the Cow Protection of Cow and Gausavardhan Act 2015 as soon as it came to power

 Like Hindi poetry, Hindi story is not very selective and not at all diverse
 idhar susheel siddharth ke sampadan main teen khandon main hindi ke 27 yuva kahanikaron kii kahaniyon or aatmakathyon kaa sankalan hindi kahani kaa yuva paridrishy aayaa he
 The coming of such a full collection is a matter of pride for the literature of any language, provided it is also a true representation of its subject
 yahaan neelakshi singh, kavita, alpana mishra, manisha kulshreshth, kailash banavaasi, vimal chandra pandeya, ravi bule, umashankar choudhary jaise yuva kathakaron kii upasthiti is sanchayan ko pranvan to banaati he par sampurna nahin
 Actually, Sushil Siddharth could not make it representative
 jis yuva kahani kii charchaa kii vajah se yah sankalan aayaa he, us yuva kahani ko jin kathakaron ne sabase adhik urja di he unamem pramukh mohammad aarif, chandan pandeya, kunal singh, manoj kumaar pandeya, anil yadav or geet chaturvedi kaa yahaan na hona hairaani bharaa he or sanchayan ko paridrishy kaa pratinidhitiv karne se roktaa he
 The absence of these first-line storytellers in three volumes and 27 storytellers is indeed surprising
 paridrishy par tippanee karte hue sampadak ne likhaa he, “vagarth, nayaa gyanoday, kathadesh or pahal aadi patrikaon ne parivartan ko achook tareeke se pahachaanaa
 One thing was interesting
 shuddh bazaar ke dabaav main sampadakon main yah hode bhi dikhi ki ham kin-kin rachanakaaron par apni mohar laga den
 "interestingly, he chose Prasan Tabassum Nihan and Vivek Mishra in lieu of young representative storytellers like Mohammad Arif and Chandan Pandey, the real market pressure appears here
 tab bhi jab ve bhoomika kii shuruyaat or samaapan karte hue baar-baar pustak ke prakaashak kaa “dhanyavad” karte hai
 If this collection was the publisher's vision, then what was the editor's need? In the role, Sushil Siddharth has done the work of filling the pages instead of critically and deeply analyzing the scenario
 saavdhaanee itani he ki ve nawein dashak ke sampradayik ubhaar ko “ayodhya cond” kii sangya dekar chupchaap aage bad jate hai
 In the same way, they do not provide any basis for the sequence of storytellers (and stories)
 jo kahaniyaan or kahanikar unhone chune hai unako dekha jaae
 Rangmahal includes Nachi Radha (neelakshi Singh), Mukti Prasang (alpana Mishra), Mirror, Sapne and Vasantasena (ravi Bulle), River that still flows (kavita), Ramdhan in the market (kailash Banavasi), Uttar Pradesh Ki Khiladi (vimal Chandra Pandey), Utopia (vandana Raga) and Khunta (anuj) are really good picks
 behatar hota ki manisha kulshreshth, pratyaksha, prabhaat ranjan or umashankar choudhary kii un kahaniyon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa jinhen pathakon ne zyada pasand kiya he
 Ramdhan in the market is the story that was published in Vasudha long before the arrival of Yuva Kahani and this story told with the advent of liberalization-globalization phenomenon how difficult this new phase is going to be for farmers and working people
 
 asmitai lekhan ke aakarshan or simaaon se ladati hui jin kahaniyon ne vaaki badi chalaang lagaai he unamem neelakshi singh kii rangmahal main naachi radha awwal he
 The socio-cultural truths that Neelakshi has inaugurated in the middle-aged housewife's inauguration makes the story a big masterpiece

 It is good that on the pretext of the self-statements given here, some things have also come out of the ideology and composition process of these authors
 yuva kahani ke aagaman main vastutah jo saamaajik, aarthik or rajnatik kaaran rahe hai unhen thik se vishleshit kiye bina iskaa moolyankan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Otherwise, there is some reason why the generation whose writers felt the urge to be genuine for credibility in writing, the same generation does not hesitate to make compromises in their political commitment
 yahi nahin, banaavat kii naveenta kaa durnivaar aakarshan bhi, jo bhale hi kathy ke sampreshan main baadha ban jaae, is peedi ke lekhakon main dekha ja saktaa he
 Despite this, it was possible due to the narrator of this generation of famous senior narrators that the mind of the minority community could now come to the mind

 It was 30 years ago, that is, on 24 June 1989, when a cannon united the entire opposition in the Lok Sabha
 vah bhi tab jab vipaksh kaa koi netaa nahin tha
 a minister in the ruling party unofficially became the leader of the opposition
 usee ke baad vipaksh ke 110 saansadon main se 106 ne istipha de diya tha
 The day proved to be a disaster for Indian politics and the Congress in particular
 maamla 1437 karod rupye ke boforce ghotaale kaa tha
 In which 400 mm howitzer cannons were signed with the Swedish company AB Bofors and the government of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 1986 main hue boforce deal main dallali or bhrashtachar kaa khulaasa 1987 main swedish radio ne kiya
 It was alleged that the company had given a bribe of Rs 60 crore to the leaders of India and the Defense Department official for the deal
 iske baad desh ke media main bhi yah khabar teji se faili
 It was investigated by the CAG after being accused
 kaig ne apni report main bataaya ki hathiyaaron ko maanakon kaa ulanghan karke kharida gaya tha
 Along with this, the CAG also stated that the delivery of weapons was intentionally delayed
 us samay, 514 siton vaali loksabhaa main vipaksh ke keval 110 saansad the, inamen vishesh rup se bijepi ke (maatr) 2, janata party ke 10, vampanthi 22, telugu desham 30, ediemke ke 12 pramukh the
 106 opposition mps had resigned
 yahaan vipaksh kii majbootee ke saath hi satta kii kamajori bhi nikal kar saamne ai
 Because the hero of opposition unity was VP Singh, who came out of power
 tab bhaajapa ke netaa or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kaha tha ki ham top ko lekar hue bhrashtachar kaa bharpoor virodh karenge
 Elections were to be held in 1989 only
 rajeev gandhi kii congress sarkaar ke dobaaraa chunaav jeetne kii puri ummid thi, lekin achaanak se samay badla, raajnneeti badal gai
 But with the opposition coming together, the dice were reversed
 us samay vipaksh ke paas koi netaa nahin tha, lekin sabane milakar ekta dikhaai or satta paksh kii naak main dam kar diya tha
 VP Singh, despite being given an important position, had made this scandal public by the then defense minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who did not compromise even a little with his honest image, a staunch critic of Rajiv Gandhi
 kaig kii report or veepi singh ke khulaase ke baad vipaksh ne maang kii ki rajeev gandhi istipha den
 Later when Rajiv did not resign, the opposition mps resigned
 iske baad vipaksh kii ekajutata se 404 siten jitkar ai congress kii purna bahumat vaali sarkaar kii jaden tak hill gai thim
 From the Bofors scandal to the civil war between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, the Rajiv government was badly engulfed on many fronts
 sarkaar main raksha mantralay kaa kaarybhaar sambhaal rahe veepi singh hi rajeev gandhi ke kattar aalochak banakar ubhare
 Because Rajiv Gandhi also removed from VP Singh's cabinet in 1987
 janata dal party banaai or phir baad main sarkaar bhirajiv gandhi kii in sabhi karrwai se naaraaz vishwanath pratap singh ne na keval congress kii sadsyta se istipha de diya, balki apni loksabhaa kii seat bhi chhod di
 In this battle, strong Congress leaders like Arun Nehru and Arif Mohammed Khan stood with Vishwanath Pratap Singh
 11 oktober 1988 ko janamorcha, janata party, lokdal or congress (es) kaa vilay karke janata dal naamak nayaa rajnatik sanghathan taiyaar kiya gaya
 Soon, several regional parties like Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) also joined the Janata Dal
 inhen partiyon ko milakar ek gathbandhan taiyaar kiya gaya
 Which was given the name of National Front
 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav main neshnal front majbootee ke saath congress ke khilaaf chunaav main utaara
 The National Front fielded candidates for a total of 244 seats in this election, out of which 143 candidates were successful in winning the election
 nehru or indira ke samay bhi nahin tha vipaksh ke netaa24 june 1989 kii ghatana chhod de to pichley 70 varshon main kabhi bhi majboot vipaksh nahin ban sakaa
 Only weak opposition always appeared
 aaj bhi desh main vipaksh jaisi cheez najar nahin aati
 Neither party had the numbers to form a leader opposition after the 2014 elections
 vipaksh ke netaa ke liye jaruri he ki kisi dal ke paas kam se kam 10% (55 saansad) hon
 But the Congress had only 44 mps
 jawaharlal nehru ke kaarykaal main kabhi koi vipakshi netaa nahin rahaa
 Because no party could achieve the number of 10%
 indira gandhi ke vakt bhi lambey samay tak sansad main koi vipakshi-netaa nahin rahaa
 The sensation spread after the woman's mutilated body was found in the country's capital, Delhi

 laash kaa sir or haath-pair gaayab the
 Ramshankar said that he had put his head and arms in a tempo passing by there
 usne police ko bataaya ki kalavati kaa chaal-chalan thik nahin tha
 She confessed to Kalavati many times but she did not listen
 samaaj main badanaami ke dar se usne kalavati ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 At the same time, the police doubt how a single person can carry out such a case of murder
 philhal police ne ramshankar ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The accused is being questioned by the police

 lekin jamini str par kisaanon kii kya haalat he, ye kisi ko jaananaa he to maharashtra main sookhe kii chapet main aae pune zile kii 7 tahseelon (taluka) main aakar dekhe
 People of about 100 villages have to struggle for drop of water here
 kuen sookhe pade hai
 There is no water even at the depth of 300 feet of the land
 yahaan pichley chah maheene se hi halaat badtar hai
 Water is being transported here by tankers
 pani ke sankat ko isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki pashuon ko kisaan ganda pani pilaane ko majaboor hai
 After the bathing of humans, animals are being fed by collecting dirty water
 maharashtra ke vidarbha or marathavada kshetron main har saal hi sookhe kii maar ke samachar aate rahete hai
 But this time the drought has also hit the western part of the state
 pune kii suukhaagrast 7 tahseelon main jahaan tak nazar jaati he, bura haal nazar aata he
 Dry crops, dry wells, useless hand pumps, ground cracks
 kisaanon ko bas ek hi intazaar ki kab tanker aae or unhen kuch pani mili
 This is the first time in the last 5 years that these 100 villages of Pune are facing a famine
 pichley paanch saalo main ye pehali baar hua he ke pune jile ke saat taluka main 100 aise gaanv he jahaan akaal padaa hua he
 Pune District Magistrate Naval Kishore Ram has also considered the water crisis serious
 pune shahar se 80 kilometre dur madgudwari gaanv main ajtak / india today ne pahunch kar jamini sthiti kaa gauge liya
 It can be understood by looking at the gathering of people near the water tanker sent by the administration here that the problem of water is so serious
 mahila ne pehle pani se bachche ko nahalaaya or phir usee pani ko jaanavar ko pilaayaa (ye photo hamaare samvaadadaata pankaj khelkar ne ek maheene pehle clic kii thi)gaanv ke sarpanch ganesh midgule ke mutabik is baar kaa akaal 1972 se bhi bada ho saktaa he
 Midgule said that there was little water left in the ground but this year there was no rain in both the seasons
 sarpanch ne bataaya ke pehle saal ke paanch maheenon main hi tanker kii zarurat hoti thi lekin is saal 8 maheene tanker kii aavashyaktaa padane vaali he
 Due to lack of water, people have to withdraw from farming
 unhen subah hi 30-40 kilometre dur jaakar mehnat-mashkkat kerani pad rahi he
 So that some money can be earned and grains can be brought to feed the families
 gaanv kii ek mahila ne bataaya ki pani ko bachaane ke liye wo iskaa kam se kam istemaal kar rahe hai
 Even people are drinking very little water
 is vajah se urinary trek infections, pathari or kabz jaisi bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 According to an elderly village man, every family gets a barrel of water in two days
 bujurg ne bataaya ki unke khet main 40 pashu hai or unhen in bejubaan jaanavaro ke liye har do din baad jeb se dedh hajaar rupye kharch kar pani kaa tanker bulaanaa pad rahaa he
 This series has continued unabated for the past several months
 madgudwari ke ek saamaajik kaaryakarta ke mutabiq dimbe baandh se ek nahar nikalati he
 Earlier this river passed near the village of Margudwadi
 lekin nahar kaa nirmaan gaanv se dur kiya gaya
 Had it been passed, there would have been plenty of water in the village
 shiur tehsil ke ek prashasnic adhikari ke mutabik gaanv waalon kii maang par unhen tanker se niyamit pani uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 According to the official, if there is a proposal to bring the canal to the village, it will be sent to the government
 adhikari ne mana ki agar aisa kadam uthaaya jaataa he to isse ilaake ke 15 gaanvon kii pani kii samasya sulajh sakati he
 Pune District Magistrate Nawal Kishore Ram said that 7 out of 14 tehsils of the district are facing famine
 ram ne mana ki kam barish kii vajah se fasal 33 % se 50 % tak barbaad ho gai
 The wells have dried up and the water has gone down over 300 feet
 july maheene se hi tanker se pani pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The District Magistrate said, "for the first time, about 100 villages in Pune district are facing drinking water shortage
 prashasan kii ore se tanker se pani pahunchane ke liye paryaapt intazaam kiye gaye hai
 The crisis will intensify in april-june as the outbreak of drought will increase

 At the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, devotees will now be able to have an hour's touch
 iske liye mandir prashasan ne anumati pradaan kar di he
 Vishal Singh, the Chief Executive Officer of Vishwanath Temple told that in the evening before the Saptrishi Aarti, a touch of Baba will be made possible
 yah vyavastha shuukravaar se hi lagu ho gai he
 Before the month of Sawan, the temple administration had prohibited the sparsity
 is maukey par baba vishwanath kaa jalabhishek karne ke liye garbhagrih ke baahar pital kaa paatr laga he, jisase pipe ko joda gaya he
 He told that devotees pour Ganga water into the vessel, from where Baba is anointed with Ganga water through a pipe
 sawan maah bhar yah vyavastha thik se lagu rahi
 Due to this, people who saw darshan could not go in large numbers
 isse mandir kii vyavastha sucharu dhang se chal pai thi
 Vishal said that due to less space inside the temple, devotees used to take more time, hence this system was implemented in Sawan
 nai vyavastha ko lekar andar hi andar virodh ke swar uthne lage the
 In view of this, the temple administration has decided to relax the ban
 gauratlab he ki sawan maah biit jane ke baad kaashi vishwanath main ek aadesh jari hua tha ki jharkhand ke devgarh main sthit baijnath dham kii tarj par kaashi vishwanath baba kaa darshan baahar se hi karne ko milegaa
 At the same time, Jalabhishek and Dahibabhishek will be done in the vessel at the entrance of the sanctum sanctorum, from where it will automatically climb over Baba through the pipe

 The Supreme Court declared the ban unconstitutional in four states
 varisht vakil harish salve ne nirmaataaon kaa paksh rakhaa
 Salve said, a certificate has been received by the censor board to screen the film across the country
 aise main rajyon kaa pratibandh asanvaidhanik he
 It should be removed
 is bich supreme court ke faisle ke turant baad rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje sarkaar ne apaat baithak bulaai he
 In which the government's move on Padmavat was considered
 supreme court ne kya kahagruuvaar ko chif justise of india kii bench ne kaha, rajyon main kaanoon vyavastha bananaa rajyon kii jimmedaari he
 It is the constitutional obligation of the states
 samvidhan kii artical 21 ke tahat logon ko jivan jeene or swatantraaa ke adhikaar kaa hanan he
 The bench termed the state notifications as incorrect
 supreme court ne kaha, is notification se artical 21 ke tahat milane vaale adhikaron kaa hanan hota he
 It is the responsibility of the states to maintain law and order
 rajyon kii yah bhi jimmedaari he ki film dekhne jane vaale logon ko surakshit maahaul mili
 Earlier, the Attorney General asked for Monday's time to stand for the states
 lekin court ne rajyon ke notification par sthagan de diya
 Earlier, while favoring the manufacturers, Salve said, "prohibition of states is to destroy the federal structure under the Cinematography Act
" rajyon ko is tarah kaa koi haq nahin he
 He also said that under the guise of law and order, there is a game of political profit loss
 bataa den ki vycom 18 ne yachika daayar kar chaar rajyon ke bain kaa virodh kiya tha
 The four states that imposed the ban are expected to present their case on Monday
 padmavat ke nirmaataa deshbhar ke cinemagharon main 24 janvari ko iskaa ped privyuu rakhenge
 'padmavat' distributors 24 January night 9
 30 baje screen hone vaale shoj kaa bhugtan karke uski jagah ‘padmavat’ ko screen karenge
 In the opinion of the film expert, doing this will give the makers of 'padmavat' a chance to prove the rumor about the film wrong
 saath hi, film dekhne ke baad logon kii positive rispons film ke liye phydemand hoga
 The film 'padmavat' is banned in Haryana as well, so far the Red Signal that has been received from these states is banned in four states of the country

 Police in Goa have recommended the state government citing security reasons
 mumbai police ne security rigens kii duhai di he
 UP and other states talked about the film's performance a few days ago
 unhone abhi pradarshan ko lekar kuch saafe nahin kiya he
 Is this a big reason why Bhansali wants 'padmavat' to be released only on January 25, because of which the film is being released, there is an allegation of the controversial portrayal of Padmarani Padmini
 karani sena ne kaha ki film main aitihaasik tathyon se chhedchhad kii gai he
 There is a dream sequence between Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmini
 ghumar gane par bhi rajavaadon ne virodh jataayaa
 However manufacturers have given clarification on all points
 sensor ne bhi ise lekar paanch ahm badlaav sujhaaye the jise nirmaataaon ne puraa kar diya he

 unhone kaha, 'yah rani padmini kaa sammaan he
 There is no such thing in the entire film, which should be objected to
 mujhe is baat par hairaani he ki kuch log is film kaa virodh kar rahen hai
 'shri Shree also said, the controversy that has so far arisen about the film is needless
 yah film rani padmini ko sachhee shradhanjali or rajputon ke sammaan kii gaurav gaatha he
 Meanwhile, there is street protest in Rajasthan over the film's performance

 sensor ne paanch modification ke saath film ko u / a certificate diya he
 Films with this certificate are not allowed to be viewed by minors alone
 yah desh kii pehali aisi hindi film hogi jo IMAX 3D hindi main relies hogi
 Censor had formed a special committee a few days ago, the censor informed about the completion of the certification process of the film
 sensor ne iske liye cameti gathit kii thi
 In a meeting with the producers following the recommendations of the committee, 5 essential changes to the film were suggested

 a video has become increasingly viral on social media for the past few days
 viral video main muslim topi pahane kuch log ek dharmik sthal par pathar maarthe najar aa rahe hai
 In Attali village of Faridabad, it is being claimed that Muslim youths pelted stones at women performing kirtan in the temple
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne padtaal main paaya ki viral video kareeb chaar saal purana he
 The religious place seen in the video is not the temple but the Jama Masjid located in Sanganer, Jaipur

 This video is being rapidly shared on Facebook and Twitter
 video ke capshan main likhaa gaya he, 'kal shaam ko ataali gaanv faridabad main shantipriy muslim logo dwaara mandir main kirthan kar rahi mahilao par patharav
 a conscious woman made the video which has failed all over India
 kisi news channel pe ye nahin dikhaaya jayega
 To investigate the viral video, when we looked at its comments section, we found that a user had described it as a video of Jaipur
 isi disha main apni padtaal ko aage badhaate hue hamane google maps ke jariye jaipur main maujuud masjidon kii khoj shuru kii
 Our search was completed by visiting Jama Masjid in Kagji Colony of Sanganer, Jaipur

 Photo of Jama Masjid available on Google Maps We tried to contact Jama Masjid's phone number available on Google Maps, but that number was not valid
 iske baad hamane just dial kii madad se masjid ke aas-paas rahane vaale logon kii khoj shuru kii, to hamen irshaad ali kaa number mila
 Irshad lives near the mosque and does handmade paper business

 At that time there was a quarrel between the Jamati and Sunni sections over some thing, after which people from one of these parties threw stones at the mosque
 yah mohalle kaa aapasi jhagada tha jise baad main sulajhaa liya gaya tha
 In the investigation, it became clear that the viral video was not from Faridabad, but from Jaipur, and here Muslim youths pelted stones at the mosque, not at the temple

 Sowing of kharif crops such as soybean, paddy, cotton, maize may be delayed by at least two weeks due to slow progress in monsoon rains in central and western India
 isaki vajah se antat: paidaavaar main kami aa sakati he
 Direct connection with the economy accounts for about 70% of the total rainfall in India during the monsoon season
 isliye monsoon bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa aadhaar ban gaya he
 Due to good monsoon rains, agricultural yields are good and this boosts the rural economy
 isaki vajah se sona-chaandi se lekar tractor, car, motorcycle, refricrator jaise upabhokta vastuon kii bikri main oochaal aata he
 Due to the decrease in soybean production, India will be forced to import edible oils like palm oil, soy oil
 duusari taraf, kapaas ke paidaavaar main kami se iske niryaat main kami aa sakati he
 Likewise, India is the world's largest exporter of rice, but its yields may be adversely affected due to lower yields

 Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Faizal said that the meeting with Kulbhushan Jadhav's mother and wife was not under counselor access

 During this, both spoke openly
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan bhartiya diplomet jepi singh bhi maujuud the or wo ye meeting dekh rahe the
 However, he was not allowed to meet
 tippaniyan Spokesperson Mohammad Faizal said that we fulfilled the promise we had made with India
 hamane bharat se 30 minute ke mulaakaat kaa vaada nibhaayaa tha, usase hamane usase na zyada or na kam nibhaayaa he
 However, he later reduced the 30-minute meeting to 40 minutes at Jadhav's request
 jabaki vaada sirf 30 minute tak kaa hi tha

 We kept the promise of 30 minutes of meeting with India, we have not fulfilled more or less than that
 haalanki, baad main unhone jadhav ke anurodh par 30 minute kii is mulaakaat ko 40 minute tak kar diya
 While the promise was only for 30 minutes
 VIDEO: pakistan main kulbhushan jadhav se mila parivaar \ VIDEO: Family met Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistan shaharon main rahane vaale zyaadaatar logon ke man main gaanv kii tasviir kachche makaanon, kachi sadakon or kheton main kaam karne vaale ashikshit logon ke rup main hi hoti he
 But the truth is that now the villages are no longer the days of Sholay, there has been a tremendous change in them
 pichley kuch saal se shahari bharat ke mukaable gramin bharat zyada teji se bad rahaa he or ab zyaadaatar sanghathanon ke adhyayan bas us cheez ko hi pakad rahe hai jo jaankaree hamaari company indicas ke saathi bahut pehle hi juta chuke hai
 According to the National Sample Survey (NSS), between 2004-05 and 2009-10, rural unemployment has decreased by 39 lakhs
 gaanv ke logon kii aay bhi teji se bad rahi he
 According to the Credit Suisse report of 2011, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of rural India was 1 as compared to urban India
 5 fisadi zyada badha he
 In rural India, where this increase 6
 2 fisadi rahi, vahiin shahari bharat main sirf 4
 It is 7 percent
 eneses ke aankadon ke aadhaar par dhamakriti joshi dwaara taiyaar crisil report ke anusaar, 2009-10 or 2011-12 ke bich gramin pariwaron kaa kharch 3
 7 lakh crore (trillion) Rs
 tak badha he, jabaki is dauraan shahari pariwaron kaa kharch 3 lakh karod ru
 Has been less than
 is dauraan gramin bharat kii vruddhi dar 2 fisadi zyada rahi he
 Meanwhile, rural India is moving faster than cities in acquiring education
 pariwaron ke esets kii baat karen to gramin bharat ke log zyada tu whealer or tivi kaa istemaal kar rahe hai (graph dekhen)
 This change is not just due to improvement in agricultural productivity (marginally), or NREGA (more than cumin in the camel's mouth) or higher minimum support price (some commodities cover a small part of the rural economy)
 
 gramin bharat kii utpaadakta main baari or spasht sudhaar hua he (haalanki iskaa koi likhit sakshya nahin he) jisamen menufairing or sarvice sector kaa sudhaar bhi shaamil he
 Today, about three-fourths (apparently 73 per cent) of the rural economy is in service and manufacturing and this share is likely to grow even further
 gramin bharat kii utpaadakta main sudhaar 2000 ke dashak main hone vaale teen tarah ke vikaas yaa sudhaar se hua
 First, the spread of telecom networks across India
 gramin bharat main telecom seva kii pahunch 2000 main 0
 It has increased from 7 per cent households to more than 33 per cent in 2011 and it is yet to grow
 is dauraan gramin bharat main telecom kii kul milakar vruddhi 19 guna ho gai, jabaki shahari bharat main yah 6 guna badi
 Due to this network, unlike other countries, affordable services can also be raised in greater quantity to the lower classes in India
 is baat kii jaankaree sab ko he ki dihadi mazdooron ko ab rojgaar ke behatar avasar mil rahe hai, kisaanon or machuaaron ko apane utpaadon kii acchhee keemat mil rahi he or yuvaaon ko shiksha ke zyada vikalp mil rahe hai
 Another major improvement was the laying of good roads in rural areas
 isaki vajah se sabhi gaanvon ko ek-duusare se or bade bazaaron se joda ja sakaa
 Between 2004 and 2008, the length of rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana tripled to 1,61,000 km
 2004 main kul sadakon main gramin sadakon kaa hissaa sirf 2 fisadi tha, lekin 2008 tak yah badhkar 5 fisadi ho gaya
 Actually it has increased even more, but the latest information about this is not available
 in sadakon par nijee transport sevaayen, motorcycle har samay dikhne lageen or gaanvon main salbhar nijee transport, maal or sevaaon kaa parivahan saste or niyamit daron par hone laga
 But surprisingly, India's city-centric academic class did not try to understand this revolutionary development and their impact on productivity
 teesraa sabase bada vikaas shaayad sabase mahatvapurn he or yah communication or transport main sudhaar kaa hi nateeja he
 Human capital is improving rapidly in rural India
 yah sab jaanate hai ki bahut se sarkari skool kuch nahin karte, lekin unamem jo sudhaar aa rahaa he uski tarif karne vaale kam hai
 Today in rural India, there is hardly any child who does not go to school
 ab teacher bhi dehati ilaakon main padhaane ko taiyaar dikhte hai kyonki paas ke kasbon yaa shaharon se gaanvon tak yatra karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 The youth of the village come daily to the nearby cities for education
 iskaa nateeja yah he ki eneses ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2004 or 2010 ke bich gramin bharat kii kaam karne vaali jansankhya main secondary, hair secondary, graduate or post graduate logon kii sankhya main kramash: 45, 60, 39 or 28 fisadi kii badhat hui he
 As we have included many examples in this issue, at least some of the rural people who get better education stay in the villages
 kaamyaab gramin logon kaa yah samooh ateet ke logon se kaaphi alag he
 He is not only inspired by the passion or ideal of change in the villages, but he is also confident that he and his family can lead a happy, satisfying life in the village itself
 ve tarakkee kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai or usamen yogadan bhi kar rahe hai
 It is the Indian who is changing rural India the most — not as an idealist but as a realist who sees the opportunity and is actively participating in the new fast wave that is underway in rural India
 isliye hamen ab ek samruddhi chakra kaa ubhaar dikhnaa shuru hoga
 When better educated people make use of the huge opportunities, then they will also make room for others
 iske badale ve sunishchit karenge ki behatar shiksha or sakriy udhyamiyon kaa kam-se-kam kuch hissaa to gramin bharat main kaam karne ke liye taiyaar ho
 Some of these people can do this even while living in cities, because it has become easier to travel long distances with better transport system
 haalanki, bhartiya niti-niyantaa is chakra kii do mahatvapurn visheshtaon ko nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 These are usually short-lived and will end, unless there is free movement of goods and services from such areas to the people of the outside world
 duusari baat yah he ki gramin bharat tab tak hi tarakkee kar saktaa he, jab shahari bharat sakasham tareeke se kaam kare
 Many nostalgic thinkers have cited the main reason behind the rise of rural India as NREGA and high agricultural support prices, while the data are lacking to substantiate these claims
 gramin bharat main yadi yah bada badlaav kalyankari yojanaon kii vajah se aayaa he to aisa lagata he ki bharat ne tarakkee kaa bilkul ek nayaa model khoj liya he!tarakkee tikaoo tab hi rah sakati he jab utpaadakta main sudhaar ho or is sudhaar ko tikaoo rakhane ke liye arthvyavastha ko kholaa janaa chahie
 But rural India is still a partially open economy
 kanoon, buniyadi dhaancha, prakriyaayein, vyavhaar or bhrashtachar ek saath milakar gramin ilaakon ko oonchi deevaaron se ghire dwipon jaisaa hi banaate hai
 Technology sometimes leaks from these walls and creates a positive wave
 2000 ke dashak ke duusare hisse main bilkul aisa hi hua he
 But whether it is irrigation system, mandis, highways, goods godowns, training institutes or strange laws, much has not changed in the villages
 jitani sakriyata ham dekh rahe hai, utana hi yah bhi dekhenge ki gramin bharat thakaan kii giraft main aa rahaa he
 Reforms and investment have brought some benefit to urban India and some have leaked to rural areas
 lekin jaise shahari bharat ummiido se halkaan padataa ja rahaa he, vahi haalat jaldi hi gramin bharat kii bhi hogi
 Towns and villages are nothing but well-off houses with a few markets scattered in between
 lekin shaharon main rahane vaale logon ke vishaal samooh ko gaanvon main rahane vaale chote samoohon ko tikaoo banane or use oonchai dene main mahati bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 Cities can actually enable villages to take advantage of economic growth
 isliye agar gramin bharat ko aage baduya he to bhartiya shaharon ko acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 After all, there was such a reason that after the collapse of cities in the agricultural-centric Great Indus Valley Civilization, the entire civilization was waned
 is samay kii sarkaar se to bahut kam ummid yaa apeksha kii ja sakati he, lekin bhavishya ke niti-niyantaa kripaya ise dhyaan main rakhen
 Rural India can grow rapidly and should also increase, but for this we have to remove all the walls that our elders have put in the way

 Despite all government efforts, the price of onion is not taking the name of falling
 ab to iskar chhaapon ke khilaaf nasik ke pyaaj kaarobaariyon ne do dinon ke hadtaal kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 That is, the public's trouble will increase and the opposition's attack on the government will intensify
 vaise somvaar ko dilli main mahangaai ko lekar sachiv str kii baithak bulaai gai he, jisamen khaskar pyaaj kii badhati keemton par charchaa hogi
 The skyrocketing prices of onions gave senior BJP leader LK Advani an opportunity to attack the government
 ravivaar ko guwahati main ek raily ke dauraan adwani ne pyaaj kii keemton ko lekar upie sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 On the other hand, Sharmila Thackeray, wife of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Mumbai, was also cursing the government for the rising prices of onions
 sharmila thakare ne sadak par nikalakar jahaan logon ko 9 rupye kilo pyaaj baante, vahiin maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko ek baksaa pyaaj bhi bhej diya
 On the other hand, onions were brought from Pakistan to give relief to the people in Delhi, but people do not like these onions
 alam ye he ki thok bazaar main ab bhi pyaaj 60 rupye kilo bik rahaa he
 Meanwhile, angry onion traders have decided to keep the market closed for two days due to the survey being conducted by the Income Tax Department in Nashik, which may have an impact on the markets across the country

 is sanskaran ke liye america, rus, sweden, korian ganatantr, switzraland, sanyukt arab emirate or portugal aadi deshon ne apni bhagidaari kii pushti kii he
 The eighth edition of this exhibition took place in February 2014
 uttar pradesh main police vyapaariyon kaa kaisaa utpeedan kar rahi he, iskaa khulaa najaara guuruuvaar ko kanpur main dekhne ko mila
 Whereas the police seized millions of rupees of a businessman as hawala money in connection with his goodwork, while the income tax team, after investigation, had justified this money and reported it as income tax
 police ke is khulaase kii sabase sharmnaak baat to ye thi ki jab paise kaa maalik vyapari vyapaar mandal ke saikadon logon ke saath esaspi ko hakeekat bataane panhucha to esaspi ne bina vyapaaree kii baat sune apane sipaahiyon se kahkar unako apane offis se baahar nikalava diya
 Appreciate that the Income Tax had given the letter to the merchant and police at one o'clock, the merchant's money is correct, but the Kanpur SSP made a press conference at 5 o'clock that the money was for hawala
 or jab press conference ke dauraan vyapaaree radheshyaam apane vyapaar mandal ke saath esaspi yashasvi yadav ko apni fariyaad bataane pahunche to unhone yah kehete hue unako baahar nikalava diya ki bina ijaajat yahaan kaise aa gayi
 SSP Kanpur Yashswi Yadav says, 'harbans Mohal Police has got a great success in smuggling and hawala
 ek vyapaaree radhe shyaam ko rangehathon 7 lakh rupee ke saath giraftaar kiya gaya he
 They did not have any papers
 paisa hamane jabt kar liya he
 It is said that they do business of mutilated notes
 'kanpur ke ghantaghar main buudhvaar ko police ne checking ke dauraan vyapaaree radheshyaam kii gaadi roki thi, jisamen unke paas 6,91,000 rupaya mila tha
 The police reached Harbans Mohal police station with this money and the merchant, where the businessman said that my money is number 1
 main isko banaras se laa rahaa hum
 When the police checked the notes with Assistant Director of Income Tax Tarun Kushwaha in the morning, after seeing the paper of the merchant, he reported at 1 o'clock that the money was income tax paid
 isliye paisa vyapaaree ko relies kar diya jaae lekin police ne gudwork ke laalach main vyapaaree or uske paison ko giraftaar dikhaa kar 5 baje yah press conference kar di ki ye hawala kaa paisa he
 When hundreds of business people went to the SSP to collect the income tax letter as a reality, they got them out of their greed for good work
 vyapaar mandal ke netaa kusal bhaatia ne bataaya, 'hamaare parichit kii gaadi buudhvaar ko police ne roki thi
 Went to the police station with their money
 vyapaaree ne bataaya tha ki paisa sahi he
 Income tax officer Tarun Kushwaha also ordered the money to be corrected and released, but the police made the accused accused of good work
 'kanpur police ke gudwork ke liye vyapaaree ko abhiyukt bana dena koi nayaa maamla nahin he
 Even before this, many such black exploits of the police have been revealed, but this time it is a matter of regret that when the income tax report is telling the businessman right, the SSP got him out without hearing the complaint of the traders
 kya aise hi adhikariyon or gudwork ke bal par akhilesh sarkaar uttar pradesh main vyapaariyon ko aakarshith karegi
 The success and failure of any work is an important part and the person who does any work often gets a failure
 vahiin kisi lekhak ke saath bhi aisa hona aam he
 Recently, a 1928 Rejection Letter has been going viral on Twitter, asking not to publish any author's work
 khaas baat ye he ki us letters main jis tarah se lekhak ke aavedan ko nakaara gaya he wo behad hi dilachasp he or ise log kaaphi maatra main share kar rahe hai
 50-face girl's face impaired to look like Angelina? It has been said in the news false letter that you should not have sent your work and we will not give your name to any publisher
 saath hi is letters main lekhak kii kavita kaa bekaar bhi qaraar diya
 It was written in the letter that we have not seen this useless poem till date
 hardik ke 5 or sex video viral, ladki ke saath dikhe kamare menis letters ko letters of note twitor handle ne ise twit kiya he, jise kaaphi log share kar rahe hai

 com / dqijzsigql — Letters of Note (@lettersofnote) December 3, 2017 sarkari afasaron se bhare parivaar main usne bahut pehle tay kar liya tha ki vah apane man kaa kaam karegi
 That is why in 2010 she abandoned the management of SBI Life Insurance Company's office in Connaught Place in Delhi and moved to Mumbai
 yahaan ek saheli ke saath milakar lokhandwala main 'bottlegreen’ naam se stylish kapadon kaa showrooms shuru kar diya
 Work went on
 lekin sangam kinare vaali ladki ko samandar ke shahar kii hawa kahaan raas aati bhala! so man phir uchat gaya
 She returned to Allahabad and reached her ancestral village Dhosra, 30 km from here on Pratapgarh Road
 gobar lipe chabutaron or doodh duhate kisaanon ko dekhakar uske emb dimag main nayaa pop ap blink hua—''papa desi gaayon kii seva karte hai, aasthaa ko bijness model kaa sahaara mil jaae to dharm or bijness donon chal sakate hai
 The idea changed the life of 30-year-old Nidhi Yadav
 unhone apane pita shikshavid vasudev yadav ke sahyog se desh ke alag-alag ilaakon se parityakt desi nasl kii gaayon ko gaanv laana shuru kiya
 Today he has a 100-cow cowshed 'godham' in Dhosra village
 jahaan sirf sahiwal or gir nasl kii bhartiya gaayen hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the service of Gomata is being done here or the dream of business is also progressing
 nidhi kii suniye, ''bijness se aapkaa matlab doodh or usase banane vaale utpaadon se hoga, lekin pehle vah suniye jo aapke sawaal main shaamil nahin he
 “the first thing that has happened here is that in the 40 acres of fields between which this cowshed has been made, organic farming is being done completely, because the manure for cultivation is getting from cow dung and cow urine from the cowshed
 france kii ek company ne godham kii fasal ko organic praaanpatr de diya he
 Wheat of rest farmers where Rs 1,400
 quintal bikta he vahiin godham kaa gehun 2,500 ru
 Quintal
 yahaan kii gaayen rojaanaa 15 se 20 litre doodh detii hai jo videshi nasl kii gaayon se thodaa kam he, lekin in gaayon ke rakh-rakhaav par hone vaala kharch to videshi gaayon par hone vaale kharch kaa aadha bhi nahin
 Nidhi's software engineer husband Prabhat Kumar quips, "he is not so much worried about Adya (nidhi's 4-month-old daughter) as much as cow calves
" ”nidhi bakhubi jaanati hai ki yah vakt hygin or ecofrendli jumalon ko jor se oochhaalane kaa he
 Two Tavera trains reach Allahabad in the morning with milk from the village
 godham ke doodh ke graahakon main elahabaad hycourt ke jaj, bade sarkari afasar or shahar kii mithai kii nami dukaane shaamil ho gai hai
 But Nidhi knows that this is just the beginning
 ve is jugat main lagi hai ki kis tarah godham ko 'deyari plant’ main badla jaae
 Supporting his campaign, his father Vasudev Yadav says, "if we can show the society that cow rearing is still a profitable deal, then perhaps we can get rid of the ill-fated mangoes in which cow is on the streets with polythene and tar -dadar seems to be stumbling

 During the conversation on the show, Kapil Sharma asked Prabhas if he had received more than 5000 love proposals
 Hearing this question, Prabhas was blushing first, after which he said that this thing can be true
 prabhas ne bataaya ki unhen abhi tak kai prapojal mili hai lekin unhone kabhi gina nahin
 After this Kapil hit a joke with himself
 unhone kaha ki unhen sirf ek hi prapojal mila or unhen sweekaar karte hi shaadi ho gai
 Yeh aapka dil chura le jayenge aur aap haste reh jayenge

 It is noteworthy that Thomas was posted as CVC on 7 September last year, although Mrs Swaraj objected to her appointment
 is maamle main supreme court ne kai baar tikhe sawaalon yaa tippaniyon se sarkaar ko bhi kathghare main khadaa kiya
 On the other hand, in his plea, Thomas had also argued that about 28 per cent of the mps in Parliament have criminal cases against them, yet they are playing a role in making the law, so why their deployment is wrong

 vishaanu janit bimariyon va cancer ke ilaaj main vaigyanikon ko ek protein ke rup main ek badi safalataa haath lagi he
 According to tests conducted on mice and human cells, this protein helps to increase the number of cytotoxic (killing damaging cells) t cells, which eliminates cancer cells and cells infected by viruses
 imperial college landan ke pramukh shodhakarta professor philip eshton-ricart ne kaha, "cancer koshikaon main tii koshikaon kii gatividhiyon ko simit karne kii kshamta hoti he, jiske kaaran pratiraksha pranali un par koi khaas prabhaav nahin daal paati
 " cytotoxic tii koshikaayen pratiraksha pranali kaa mahatvapurn hissaa hai, lekin jab unka saamana cancer koshikaon se hota he, to unase mukaable ke liye ve apni sankhya ko baari maatra main badha leti hai
 Researchers have discovered a species of mice that, when confronted with viruses, can produce 10 times more cytotoxic t cells than normal mice
 ye chuuhe sankraman ko zyada prabhavi dhang se dabaate hai or cancer ke prati adhik pratirodhi hote hai
 The comments iske alaava, ye ek anya prakaar kii tii koshikaon (memri koshika) kaa nirmaan karte hai, jo purv main hue sankraman kii pahchaan kar adhik prabhavi dhang se unka muqabla karte hai
 Indeed, these mice with extremely high immunity produce a largely unknown protein, which researchers have dubbed the lymphocyte expansion molecule (LEM)
 yah khoj behad apratyaashit he, kyonki is protein ke bare main pehle se koi jaankaree nahin thi or yah maujuuda gyaat protein se bilkul alag he
 ashton-rickart stated, "the patient's condition can be improved by transplanting an active LEM gene into cancer cells' t cells
 " yah adhyayan patrika 'science' main prakashit hua he
 Professor Philip ashton-rickart, head researcher at Imperial College London, said, "cancer cells have the ability to limit the activity of t cells, due to which the immune system has no significant effect on them
 " Cytotoxic t cells are an important part of the immune system, but when they are confronted with cancer cells, they increase their numbers drastically to combat them
 shodhakartaaon ne chuhon kii ek aisi prajati khoji he, jo vishaanuon se saamana hone par saamaanya chuhon kii tulana main 10 guna adhik sankhya main cytotoxic tii koshikaon kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 These mice suppress infection more effectively and are more resistant to cancer

 This finding is highly unpredictable, as there was no prior information about this protein and it is completely different from existing known proteins

 The world believes that Masood Azhar is an international terrorist and made jaish-e-mohammed a dangerous terrorist organization
 phir bhi pakistan kii sarkaar masood ajahar kii timaardaari main juty he or sena jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki daag ko dhone main
 That is why she is saying that there is no terrorist organization called Jaish
 to ham aapako pakistan ke paanch bade jhooth bataate hai
 1
 pakistan main kiski chalati hepakistan main kiski chalati he? pradhanmantri imran khan kii yaa army chif qamar javed bajva kii yaa phir kisi masood ajahar
 Some Hafiz Saeed ye sawaal ham puch nahin rahe hai balki aapako us sach se waakif karaane ke liye uthaa rahe hai ki aatankiyon ko apane aasteen main chupaane vaala pakistan kisi aatankwaadi masood ajahar or uske aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke liye kaise jajam kii tarah bicha rahata he
 If this is not the case, then why would the Pakistan Army lie about the existence of Jaish to save Masood Azhar
 2
 Exposed the lie Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf Naparvez Musharraf has been the Chief of the Pakistani Army and beyond it being a dictator
 us musharraf ne kabool kiya he ki jaish ko jammu or kashmir main aatankwaad kii khuli ijaajat to unhone bhi di thi
 The Pakistan Army should first listen to its old boss Musharraf
 ab jab musharraf ne kabool kar hi liya he to unke raaj main jaish ne kis tarah aatank failaayaa, wo aapako dikhaa dete hai
 3
 musharraf raaj main jaish ne kiye yah aatanki hamalamusharraf ke raaj main hi masood ajahar ne saal 2000 main jaish-e-mohammad banaaya
 In April the same year, a car bomb exploded in Badami Bagh Cantt area killing 30 people
 usee saal june main jaish ke aatankiyon ne jammu or kashmir ke teen javaanon ko goli maar di
 In December the same year, a BSF vehicle was attacked on the srinagar-baramulla highway
 oktober 2001 main jammu or kashmir vidhansabha main bam visphot kiya jisamen 31 logon kii maut ho gai
 In January 2003, a BSF jawan was killed in his attack on Batmaloo bus stand
 november 2005 main naugam main car bam dhamaakaa kiya jisamen 10 log maare gaye
 In March 2006, 23 people died in a grenade attack in Pulwama, while 2 CRPF personnel were killed
 may 2006 main srinagar main maanavadhikaar ayog kii gadee par hamalaa kiya
 And killed two policemen on sopore-bandipura road in July 2008
 jhooth ko benakaab kiya pakistani videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi nepakistani sena kah rahi he ki pakistan main jaish he hi nahin to phir uskaa sargana masood ajahar kaise he
 Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has exposed the lie of this lie, Pakistan is protecting its terror by calling him ill, who is the culprit of Masood Azhar Hindustan
 phir masood ajahar ke 44 aatanki rishtedaaron ko hiraasat main kyon lenaa padapulavama cond ke baad bharat ne pakistan main air strike kii
 After this, on Wednesday why 44 terrorist relatives including Masood Azhar's brother were detained by Pakistan
 pakistan jhooth bol rahaa he or uske jhooth ke chithde chithde ho chuke hai or pakistani hukumat or sena un chithdon se apni shame ko dhankane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai

 Under the supervision of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fast-paced leader Uma Bharti, some hope has been raised for Ganga from a separate ministry, but no concrete plan has been revealed so far

 ’ganga ko saaf karne ke liye 2009 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main neshnal ganga river basin atharity (enziarbie) kaa gathan hua tha

 While promising Modi the cleanliness of the Ganges, while presenting the Sabarmati river in Gujarat as an example, activists say it does not prove useful for the Ganga from anywhere
 sabarmati gujarat kii sabase badi nadi he or iskaa udgam rajasthan ke udaipur jile main aravali parvat shrankhla main sthit dhebar jhil se he
 The river flows southwest from there after 371 kilometers of travel and falls into the Gulf of Khambhat in the Arabian Sea

 River banks have been developed to lure tourists here
 paryaavarnavidon ne ullekh kiya ki sabarmati saaf nahin hui he
 Only the water of Narmada river is being poured into it so that it looks clean
 south asia network on dams naamak enjio ke samanvayak or paryaavarnavid himanshu thakkar ne kaha, ‘ahmedabad main sabarmati main jo pani bahata dikhataa he vah narmada kaa he or yah gujarat ke suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye he
 'similar to this, Gopal Krishna of the Toxic Watch Alliance also said,' Gujarat's water management model cannot succeed for Ganga, as it has not proved useful for Gujarat either
 narmada kaa jal sabarmati main bahaanaa koi samaadhaan nahin he
 Developing along the Sabarmati River is an attack on the floodplain area of the river

 For some time, BJP has been saying that people will take to the streets and there can be civil strife
 is tarah ke gaiyr jimmedaarana bayaan in karatuuton ko protsaahit karte hai
 i do not know who is really behind them but political parties and leaders should take full care before making such statements
 ’videsh mantri es em krishna ne kaha, ‘yah nindaneey he or hamen is tarah kii karatuuton ko badhaava nahin dena chahie jo hamaari loktantric paramparaon va loktantric tanebane main garimapurna nahin hai
 Party General Secretary Digvijay Singh said that the motives of people throwing shoes or showing black flags are the same
 jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne aaj kaha ki unhen is ghatana par rahul kii pratikriya thik lagi
 Omar wrote on Twitter, 'I liked Rahul's reaction to throw a shoe, throw, throw, throw another
 ’congress netaa rajeev shukla ne is puure maamle par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki juuta phenkna ab fishan ban gaya he
 Now the time has come to deal with such cases strictly

 Such cases should be dealt with vigorously

 On this statement of Sanjay Raut, Union Minister and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has told NDTV that those who talk like this need to be isolated in the society
 aisi baton se aman-chaiyn kaa maahaul bigadataa he
 Our effort should be to keep the country on the path of progress and peace
 vahiin twitor par bhi unhone vibhinn samudaayon ke bich nafrat failaane waalon ko nishane par liya he
 Although he has not named anyone in his tweet, but his tweets are clear that his reference is to this controversial statement of Sanjay Raut
 nafrat ke naksaliyon se mujhe yahi kahana he
 
 
 
 "ped jo suukh rahe hain unhen faldaar karo,nafaratein khatm karo pyaar karo pyaar karo"---meraa hindustan talibani sonch kaa jangal nahi ,insaani ,sanvaidhanik mulyon -vasulon kaa chaman he ,isapar koi nafrat kii pradooshit hawa asar nahin daal sakati
 In fact, in his article written in the Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Raut while referring to the statement of Bal Thackeray said that taking away the voting rights of Muslims in the country will only end the politics in the name of Muslim vote bank
 'saamana' main chape lekh main sanjay raut ne mulaayam singh, lalu yadav or majalis-e-ittehadul-muslimin ke ovaisi bhaaiyon par nishaanaa bhi saadhaa or kaha ki sabane musalamaanon kaa istemaal sirf siyaasi phaayde ke liye kiya
 However, later clarifying his statement, Sanjay Raut said, "as long as the vote bank's contract is with some people, the Muslims will not benefit, nor will they develop
" ye baat shivasena pramukh bala sahib thakare ne hameshaa kahi
 
 
 Balasaheb said 15 years ago that one day if you take away the voting rights of Muslims for a few days, then everyone will know
 aaj jis tarah ovaisi bhai puure desh main zehar failaane vaali bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, usase mujhe bala sahib kii yaad aa gai or maine ye baat kah di
 The ruckus started on Raut's statement
 congress ke pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki ye sunanaa bhi ajeeb he, ham loktantr main rahete hai, kisi talibani shashan main nahin
 BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said on this article of Sanjay Raut, "the country runs with discipline and not editorial"
 18 saal ke har bhartiya ko vot dene kaa adhikaar he
 We do not agree with his words
 vahiin emm ke vidhayak imtiyaaz jaleel kaa kahana tha, vah aisa kyon kah rahe hai, ye loktantr he
 
 
 This reflects his political thinking divided on the basis of religion
 sanjay raut kaa lekh bandra purv main hue upachunaav ke baad aayaa he, jahaan ovaisi bhaaiyon ne joardaar reliyaan kin
 The house of the Thackeray family is Matoshree in the same area
 yahaan pichley chunaavon main emm ummidavaar ne 23,000 se zyada vot hasil kiye the

 The trouble is that both the Trinamool and the CPM are against the creation of separate Gorkhaland, but the attitude of the agitators is telling that this time the state government will have to face more intense agitations and questions
