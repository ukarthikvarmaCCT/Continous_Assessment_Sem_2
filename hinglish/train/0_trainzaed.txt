 Excerpt from this book
 - mahatma gandhi sanatani hindu hone ke baavjood karmkandi hindu kabhi nahin rahe the
 If we talk about Delhi, he kept coming here again from April 12, 1915 to January 30, 1948, stayed here for the last 144 days, but only went to a religious place twice
 donon baar, unke vahaan jane kaa ek makasad tha
 In fact, Bapu laid a condition when Ghanshyam Birla, a prominent industrialist and an aide of Gandhiji, requested him to inaugurate the famous Birla Mandir (lakshmi Narayanamandir) located on the temple route of the capital
 unhone kaha ki ve mandir kaa udghaatan karne ke liye taiyaar hai, par unki ek shart he
 They will inaugurate the temple only if that condition is accepted
 ye baat 1939 ke sitambar maheene kii he
 Birla ji had not imagined that he would get such an answer from Gandhiji, as he had a very good relationship with Bapu, Gandhiji used to stay in his residence on Alburkar Road (now Tis Jan Marg)
 khayr, birla ji ne baapu se unki shart poochi
 Gandhiji said that the entry of Harijans into the temple will not be banned
 darasal, us daur main mandiron main harijanon ke pravesh par anek tarah se avrodh khadey kiye jate the
 Contractors of religion did not let them go to worship
 jab gandhi ji ko aashwaasan diya gaya ki birla mandir main harijanon ke pravesh par roak nahin hogi to ve birla mandir ke udghaatan ke liye raji ho gaye
 Thereafter, the Birla Temple was duly commissioned on 22 September 1939
 baharhaal, gandhi ji yahaan par udghaatan karne ke baad phir kabhi nahin aae
 But books of all religions were read in their prayer meetings
 gandhi ji ne apni patrika ‘yang india’ main april,1925 main likhaa bhi tha- “mandiron, kuon or skulon main jane or istemaal karne par jati ke aadhaar kisi bhi tarah kii roak galat he
 ”gandhiji traveled across the country from November 7, 1933 to August 2, 1934 to end untouchability
 ise gandhi kii ‘harijan yatra yaa daura’ ke naam se bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 Gandhiji had created a public awakening against untouchability in that journey of thousand miles at 12:30
 baharhaal, birla mandir kaa nirmaan 1933 se 1939 ke bich chalaa
 Thousands of people from Gol Market, Irwin Road (now Baba Kharak Singh Marg), Karol Bagh and other surrounding areas reached on the inauguration of the Birla Temple
 sabaki chahat thi ki ve mandir ke udghaatan ke bahaane baapu ke darshan kar len
 Shri Kamalkant Basu was also behind the Kali temple of Gol Markit in that crowd
 ve mandir maarg (pehle reeding road) par sthit raisina bengali skool main padhate the
 He once told that hundreds of children and their guardians of Harcourt Butler School, Tamil School, Raisina Bengali School, etc
 had reached inside and outside the Birla Temple even before Gandhi came to the Birla Temple
 ab isi sadak par birla mandir ke alaava nai dilli kaali baadi, buddha mandir, saint thomas carch or valmiki mandir bhi hai
 Bapu also continued in a room in the Valmiki temple
 par ve vahaan kabhi puja –paath nahin karte the
 At the inauguration of the Birla temple, Gandhiji also lashed out at the leprosy of untouchability
 is kaaran se kuch kattarpanthi unase naaraaz rahete the
 They used to make false personal allegations against him
 ek baar pune main un par kattapanthi sanataniyon ne bam bhi phenkaa tha
 On 19 June 1934, when Gandhi arrived at the Pune station, he was shown a black flag with the slogan 'go back to Gandhi'
 birla mandir bhagwaan vishnu or devi lakshmi ko samarpit he
 The Birla temple is also famous for its Janmashtami celebrated here
 birla mandir kaa vaastushilp odisha ke mandiron se prabhavit he
 Its exterior is made of white marble and red sandstone
 birla mandir ke bheetar bageeche or fawwaare hai
 xxrep 4 * Mahatma Gandhi arrives at the Dargah of Qutub-ud-din Bakhtiyar Kaki, three days before his death, on the morning of 27 January in the bitter winter
 ve vahaan dargah se jude logon se milte hai
 Why do they visit Kaki's Dargah in Mehrauli? Actually, it had been nearly four months since Mahatma Gandhi had come to Delhi
 par idhar sampradayik dange thamane nahin rahe the
 He arrived at Shahdara railway station here on September 9, 1947 after pacifying the riots in Noakhali
 tab dilli main sarhad paar se hindu - sikh sharnaarthi aa rahe the, yahaan ke bahut se musalmaan pakistan ja rahe the
 There was a fierce attack in Karol Bagh, Paharganj, Daryaganj, Mehrauli
 ve dangagrast kshetron kaa baar-baar daura kar rahe the
 But the talk was not being made
 unhen 12 janvari ko khabar mili ki mahrauli main sthit qutubauddin bakhtiyaar kaaki kii dargah ke bahari hisse ko dangaiyon ne kshati pahunchaai he
 After hearing this, he decided to go on fast from the very next day
 mana jaataa he ki baapu ne apana antim upwas isliye rakhaa tha taaki bharat sarkaar par dabaav banaaya ja sake ki wo pakistan ko 55 karod rupee adaa kar de
 But the truth is that his fast was about putting moral pressure on the rioters
 gandhi ji ne 13 janvari ko praat: saadhe das baje apana upwas chaalu kiya
 At that time, Pandit Nehru, Bapu's personal secretary Pyare Lal Nayyar, etc
 were there
 birla house parisar ke baahar media bhi ‘braking’ khabar paane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 By then, there was a long time left for the news channels era
 baapu ke upwas shuru karte hi nehru ji or sardaar patel ne birla house main deraa jamaa liya
 Viceroy Lord Mountbatten also visited him again and again
 baapu se apana upwas todane kaa anurodh karne ke liye saikadon hindu , musalmaan or sikh bhi pahunch rahe the
 His personal physician, Dr
 sushila naiyar unke girte swasthya par najar rakh rahi thim
 AIR was broadcasting a bulletin on Bapu's health
 unke upwas kaa asar dikhne laga
 Delhi calmed down
 tab baapu ne 18 janvari ko apana upwas todaa
 He was given fresh fruit juice by Nehruji and Maulana Azad
 is tarah se 78 saal ke baapu ne hinsa ko apane upwas se maat di
 After this, they arrive at the dargah of Kaki on 27 January in the cold winter at half past eight in the morning
 ve vahaan par musalamaanon ko bharosa dilaate hai ki unhen bharat main hi rahanaa he
 But regrettably, no Khadim associated with the Dargah is aware of what kind of relationship Bapu has with Kaki's Dargah

 Yoga teacher Ramdev has expressed confidence that from the year 2015, black money stashed abroad will start coming into the country
 ramdev ne aaj tak ke kaarykram 'sidhi baat' main yah baat kahi
 Ramdev said, 'people also ask me on Facebook and Twitter that when will black money deposited abroad come into the country? i would just like to say that in 2015 Haridwar will not only open doors for black money in the country
 'ramdev se poocha gaya ki aap to chunaav se pehle kaha karte the ki modi sarkaar ke banate hi 100 din ke andar desh main kalaadhan aa jayega or har aam aadmi ke khate main 15 lakh rupee jamaa ho jaaenge
 Now why are they saying 2015? In response to this, Baba Ramdev said, 'you are talking about black money stored outside the country, while the truth is that it is 90 percent of the total black money inside the country
 rahi baat kul kalaadhan kitna he, to desh kaa to 100 lakh karod kalaadhan baahar he or desh ke andar 900 lakh karod kalaadhan he
 India has 1 thousand lakh crores of black money at home and abroad
 rahi baat 100 din or 2015 kii, to maine 5 saal ramlila maidan se puure desh main kaledhan ke khilaaf alakh jagaai he
 Will take time
 modi sarkaar kam se kam kaale dhan kii vaapasi ke liye sahi prakriya to apana rahi he
 It was questioned that Amit Shah says that we had just promised black money before the election
 logon ne usko thik se samajhe bagaiyr kuch zyada hi ummiden laga leen? iske jawaab main baba ramdev ne kaha, 'amit shah kaa jahaan tak sawaal he, wo behad bebaak kism ke insaan hai
 They are doing all the work from the perspective of serving the country
 modi or amit shah ke rup main desh ko shashakt netritv mila he
 And speaking of Modi ji, he does what he says
 'modi sarkaar aakhir kalaadhan khataadharakon kaa naam bataane se kyon dar rahi he? iske jawaab main baba ramdev ne kaha, 'modi ji kisi se nahin darate
 Actually, there is talk of bringing economic transparency at the global level and it is also being agreed
 uske baad kisi kaa bhi naam chupaaya nahin ja sakegaa
 Half of the world economy is dominated by black money
 'is sawaal par ki logon kii un par bahut aasthaa he
 Many people voted for the Modi government on the promise of Baba Ramdev, will the faith of those people be affected? Ramdev said in response, 'I have traveled 20 lakh kilometers in 20 years, organized meetings and camps of 200 million people
 meraa sankalp adig he
 'will Baba Ramdev have the same status as Modi Chandraswami in the Congress government in the future? In response to this question, Baba Ramdev said, 'I want to see myself as a countryman, not myself
 aaj pravasi bharatiyon main bhi aatmavishvaas he
 They feel that they got such a strong PM
 'yogaguru se poocha gaya ki aaj bhagava pahane bijepi saansad bhadakaau bayaan de rahe hai
 What do you have to say on this In response, Baba Ramdev said, 'saffron-bound mps should not make such statements
 modi ji isse kaaphi dukhi hai
 This hurts the atmosphere and goodwill in the country
 bhadakaau bayanon se vishwa main bhi desh kii chhavi bigadati he
 Modi ji has only two issues - Good Governance and Development
 modi ji ke kaam ko agar main numberon main ankun, to unhen main 100 main 100 number duungaa
 'modi gave yoga an identity in the world? In response, Baba Ramdev said, 'yoga is the legacy of sages
 yoga kii antarrashtriya str par pahchaan modi kii vaishvik jeet he
 Yoga is medical science
 modi ne ayurveda par anusandhan ke liye aayush vibhaag bhi banaaya he
 'on the question that Modi and you have ever done yoga together? In response, Baba Ramdev said, 'modi and i have done yoga together
 modi karmyogi, gyaanayogi or bhaktiyogi hai
 The youth should learn from Modi
 unka vyaktigat jivan bahut sanyampurna he
 Do you ever talk to Modi? In this reply Ramdev said, 'I spoke to Modi ji on the phone a few days ago
 poocha ki kaise ho? jawaab main modi ji ne kaha ki pehle jaisaa hum
 Modi ji has not changed

 sp's Uttar Pradesh unit spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said in a statement here that the Congress government under Indira Gandhi's prime ministership in the year 1975 also stigmatized the independence movement in the country under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and imposed emergency

 ” is saal 13 aktubar ko maut ko gale lagane se pehle uskaa yahi aakhri bayaan tha
 Police recovered this statement from a room in the shape of a suicide note where the rotten corpse of a student was lying
 bihar ke purvi champaran se aayaa 18 saal kaa sanjit (badla naam) rajasthan ke kota shahar main ejineering kii koching kar rahaa tha
 But could not withstand the pressure of studies
 har saal ek lakh se zyada ladke-ladakiyon ko apane atyaadhunik koching centaron kii ore aakarshith karne vaale kota shahar kaa yah koi iklauta maamla nahin he, yahaan har maheene ausatan ek baccha kamyaabi kii daud main pichhadakar maut ko gale laga letaa he
 Not only this, at least 100 children reach the city every day to consult a psychiatrist
 ab to pramukh koching centaron ne apane yahaan sthaayee rup se manochikitsak bhartee kar liye hai, taaki bacchon kii maansik samasyaon ko tatkaal hal kiya ja sake
 But what is so lacking in the quota of clean, weathered, Rajasthani style architecture and newly designed buildings that breaks down the children who come here for future grooming to such an extent that they take terrible steps like embracing death? 
 yah sirf padhai kaa dabaav he, yaa mata-pita kii mahatvakankshaon kaa badhata boj yaa phir apni dilchaspee se bilkul hi alag maidan main utaar die jane kii tis? yaa phir aisa to nahin ki bacchon se zyada doshi unke maa-baap hai jo bacchon par res ke ghode kii tarah mote paise kaa daanv lagaate hai or unhen jeet se kam kuch nahin chahie
 If you stop a child and talk about it in a bunch of coaching children going from here to there on the streets of the city, very few of them are outspoken
 unamem se zyaadaatar yahi kehete hai ki ve yahaan man lagaakar padhai kar rahe hai or unke mata-pita unka bhala chaahate hai
 But as Kota's senior psychiatrist, Dr
 em
 L
 agarwal kehete hai, ''aap baahar se is baat kaa andaja nahin laga sakate ki aakhir bacchon ke man main chal kya rahaa he
 "agarwal is a doctor from the city who established a psychotherapy call center named 'hope' in 2010 after the Kota city reported 35 cases of suicide within three months
" is kol centre kaa makasad tha ki jo chaatr yaa aam naagarik doctor tak aane main sankoch kar rahaa he, vah bhi kisi bhi vakt phone lagaakar manovaigyanik kii salaah le sake
 In psychology, there is a belief that just before committing suicide, the person wants to talk to someone once and in such a way, if the suicide is somehow postponed, then the intention of suicide can be changed
 unke kol centre main pichley teen saal main kareeb 4,000 log phone kar chuke hai or isamen se aadhe se zyada koching ke chaatr hai
 Dr
 agarwal bataate hai, ''home sickness yaa ghar kii yaad aana zyaadaatar bacchon kii sabase badi samasya he
 There are two aspects to this problem as well
 ek to bachche ko khud hi ghar kii bahut yaad aati he, duusari taraf agar vah khud ko niyantrit kar bhi letaa he to maa-baap bhi itani baar phone karke uski khabar lete hai yaa bhavuk baaten karte hai ki baccha is samasya se chaahakar bhi khud ko nikaal nahin paata he
 Another major problem is that children, after getting into coaching, get into the habit of studying late into the night which does not match their natural routine and they have to deal with many diseases
 ”bacchon kii manodasha ko keval visheshgy hi bhaanp sakate hai
 Referring to the boy who came to him, a psychiatrist of Talwandi area of kota, Dr
 akhilesh agarwal ne ek cese study sunai: ''16 saal ke ladke ne aakar mujhse kaha ki doctor sahab aisi dawa de do ki raat main neend na aae
 i asked why? He said that the boy in the next room kept reading all night and i could not read, it caused me tension
 baad main jab maine puure maamle kii padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki bagal vaala ladkaa tub lite jalaakar sota tha or usase naahak hi meraa pesheynt pareshaani main tha
 "actually problems develop in such a way that it becomes difficult to get to their root without understanding them very deeply
 gaharaai par jane par akasar pataa chalata he ki samasya thi nahin balki banaai gai thi
 How deep such problems are in Kota, it can be understood from this that the psychiatrist who consulted in career point coaching, Dr
 deepak gupta ne shahar kii koching claason main padhgaye vaale bacchon kii maansik samasyaon par vidhivat shodh hi kar daalaa
 In a research published as 'prevention of Psychological Illness in Coaching Students of Kota' (prevention of mental illnesses in coaching students of Kota), Dr
 gupta ne shahar ke 400 bacchon par adhyayan kiya
 Of these, 200 children were from coaching classes and 200 children were from general schools
 apane shodh parinaam main unhone paaya ki koching main padhgaye vaale 26 fisadi bachche jahaan depressant or anggity kaa shikaar hai vahiin saamaanya padhai karne vaale 14 fisadi bachche hi is tarah kii samasyaon se jujh rahe hai
 This research made it clear that the main reasons for the stress of the children were - extra pressure of coaching, change in the batch of coaching, selection of wrong subject, lack of proper knowledge about the child's ability, home sickness and hereditary diseases
 koching class ke bacchon kii ek bahut saamaanya lekin aam aadmi kii najar se akasar chhitak jane vaali dikkat ko dow
 Gupta states something like, "kota is the market of toppers"
 jo bhi baccha yahaan aata he vah apane skool kaa yaa apane shahar kaa topper hota he
 When so many toppers sit in a class, all of them cannot top it
 aise main pehle test main jab bahut se bacchon kii rank achaanak gir jaati he to ve yah jhatka bardaasht nahin kar pate
 In such a situation, if family members also act harshly with the child, then sometimes they go to the extent of suicide
 ”kota kii kariyar point koching ke siemdi or siio pramod maheshwari apane chaatro se pehali class main kehete hai, ''ham ek pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 This is not a do or die battle
 ” unka maananaa he ki baccha aatmahatya tanaav se nahin, balki glani kii bhaavana se karata he
 That is why they also understand the parents, "don't talk to children like this, see son, the respect of the whole family is now in your hands
" ham to pet katkar tumhen padhaa rahe hai, agar tum naakaam ho gaye to sab bekaar ho jayega
 Govind Maheshwari, director of the Allan Career Institute, the premier coaching institute of Kota, also believes that children need to be mentally challenged
 ve kehete hai, ''koching main ham log open seshan chalaate hai
 In this, the children express their opinion, laugh and sing and there are many things besides education
 ” in donon hi santhaan ne apane yahaan sthaayee rup se manochikitsak tainaat kar rakhe hai
 But the psychiatrist is not the only cure
 kota main koching institute kaa yah haal he ki kai sansthaanon ne apane skool bhi khol liye hai
 In many places, these schools start from class six
 maa-baap bacchon ko itani choti umr se kota bhejte hai jahaan ve bachapan se hi skool or koching donon karte hai taaki jab 12veen ke baad pariksha kii vela aae to ve kisi se kam sabit na hon
 Many families are so excited about the coaching of children that the father works alone outside and the mother or any family member stays permanently in the two-room set hostel of coaching with the children
 apane do bacchon ke saath yahaan rah rahi hisar kii krishna sahaaran kahati hai, ''betaa abhi 11veen main aayaa he or koching shuru kar di he, jabaki beti 12veen ke baad yahaan ai he
 The daughter says that it would have been nice if she had come here earlier
 ” krishna ke pati hisar main professor hai or ve bacchon kii padhai ke liye puri tarah samarpit hokar kota main aa basii hai
 a family of 2 to 3 lakh on such studies
 salanaa tak kharch kar rahaa he
 Parents also know that it is necessary to make children mentally strong and to be strict is nothing more than an irrelevant measure
 isiilie koching santhaan ab sara data computeries kar rahe hai
 By pressing a button in it, the child gets to know how his performance has been in studies so far
 har test kaa pradarshan uske saamne hota he or uske paas khud ko kisi khushrahmi yaa galatfahami main rakhane kii gunjaaish nahin rahati
 If children do not ignore these results, then they can generally understand to what extent they are going to perform in a test
 koching santhaan bhi samajhate hai ki saare bachche to doctor-ejeeniyar nahin ban sakate
 Therefore, they also advise children according to their aptitude and in many cases they are advised to change the subject
 lekin jo cheez phir bhi har bachche ke saath hameshaa bani rahati he vah he unki kachi umr
 This is the age when the child is in his state of mind for the first time
 yahi yauvan kii dahalij par uskaa pehla kadam he jahaan vipareet ling ke prati uskaa prakritik aakarshan sahaj hi use apni ore khinchataa he
 From this he also has to do spiritual practice to become a future citizen
 itane saare ayaamon ke bich santulan or vivek hi uskaa saathi he
 As long as there are limited opportunities to make a career in limited fields in this country, it is impossible to free children from the need of coaching
 manochikitsak kehete hai ki bahut zyada samvedansheel bacchon ko bheed main jhonk dena, bhaad main jhonk dene se kam nahin he
 Significantly, the parents of physicist Albert Einstein, who gave the theory of relativity to the world, left him at a boarding school in Munich, Germany and moved to Italy
 lekin oinstin ko apane parivaar kii itani yaad aati thi ki unhone apane doctor ko yah likhane ke liye raji kar liya ki agar ve apane parivaar ke paas nahin gaye to avsaad or tanaav se maansik rup se biimaar ho sakate hai
 He finally reached his parents
 jaraa si chook se purvi champaran kaa sanjit faansee par latak jaataa he or thodi si samvedansheeltaa se oinstin janm lete hai
 We cannot throw this fact in such matters
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main aakhirkaar sapa or congress ke bich gathbandhan ho hi gaya
 For the past many days, there was a tussle between the two parties regarding seat sharing
 ab kul 403 vidhansabha siton main se 298 par akhilesh ke candidats chunaav ladenge, jabaki congress ko 105 siten mili he
 sp's state president Naresh Uttam and Congress leader Raj Babbar jointly announced this alliance at the Taj Hotel in Lucknow
 unhone kaha ki sampradayik takaton ko rokane ke liye donon partiyaan saath ai hai or dalit-garibon ke hit main saath karenge
 Raj Babbar said that with the tireless efforts of Akhilesh Yadav, this alliance has come true
 rajbabbar kii maane to donon partiyaan ek saath milakar uttar pradesh main sarkaar banaaegi, or mahilaon ke hit main kadam uthaae jaaenge
 On this occasion, he described the Central Government's decision of demonetisation as wrong, and described it as a big fraud with the public
 congress ne kaha ki centre main kisaan virdohi sarkaar he
 And people are happy with the alliance of sp-congress
 gathbandhan ke pich priyanka gandhi kii badi bhoomikadarasal shanivaar der raat tak tikat bantwaare ko lekar donon partiyon ke bich baithkon kaa daur jari tha, congress kam se kam 120 siten maang rahi thi, or sapa 100 siten dene ko raji thi
 Then Priyanka Gandhi herself went ahead and took over
 der raat ramgopal yadav or priyanka ke bich dilli main mulaakaat hui, uske baad priyanka kii ore se congress ke senior leaders ne akhilesh or unki party ke varisht netaaon se bhi baatcheet kii
 However, in the meantime, SP had also declared candidates for the seats of some sitting Congress mlas
 jis vajah se gathbandhan par sanshay ke badal mandara rahaa tha
 The top faction of the disheartened Congress did not give up due to lack of seats in the marathon meeting between Akhilesh and PK
 gathbandhan kii khatir priyanka gandhi ne nai dilli main ramgopal se mulaakaat kii, to vahiin duusari ore siem akhilesh yadav or congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ke bich lakhanu main do baar baithken huin
 After which the SP agreed to give 105 seats to the Congress
 akhilesh ke ravaiye se congress ne jataai thi naarazgicongress sutron ne shanivaar ko bataaya tha ki jab tak akhilesh ko sapa kaa naam or cycle chunaav chinh nahin mila tha, tab tak unhone congress ko 142 siten de rakhi thim
 Akhilesh gave this to the Congress in writing, but after getting the Samajwadi Party and bicycle, Akhilesh offered 121 seats as a compulsion
 iske baad jab 121 par congress ne haa kii, to wo 100 par atak gaye the
 He said that Netaji's list of 38 people has to be adjusted
 bataaya gaya ki ek vakt congress 110 siton par bhi maan gai thi, lekin tab akhilesh ne kaha ki kuch puraane or aazam khan sareekhe netaaon kii siton kii maang aa gai he, meri party ke kai log party chhod rahe hai
 Therefore, we will not be able to give more than 100 seats
 haalanki aakhir main 105 siton par baat ban gai
 a shocking incident has come to light in Dahi area of dhar, Madhya Pradesh

 15 football players died in a bus accident in the African country of Nigeria on Monday
 nyeegeria footbal federation ne bataaya ki sthaneey footbal team ke pandrah sadsy desh kii rajdhani abuja main ek match khilne ke liye aa rahe the tabhi unki bas durghatnagrast ho gai or usamen savaar pandrah footbal khilaadiyon kii maut ho gai

 police sutron ne bataaya nyeegeria main sadakon kii durdasha ke kaaran yahaan har saal durghatnaon main paanch hajaar log maut ke shikaar ban jate hai
 Today we are going to present such a bitter reality related to children, after knowing that you will be shocked
 bachche hamaari aabaadi kaa kareeb 48 fisadi hissaa hai
 The age at which children should have pen in their hands, they have guns in their hands
 jin haathon main kitaaben honi chahie, wo haath koon kii syaahi se gunahon ke panne bhar rahe hai
 Where does your child go kisase miltaa hai or kitni der ghar se baahar rahata he
 Keep every news of him
 ye hidaayat nahin balki ek chetavanee he or ye chetavanee ham nahin balki khud police de rahi he
 Do you know why this warning is being given? The crime figures are witnessing that the steps of the children of the country are moving rapidly towards the black world of crime
 jin haathon main kalam honi chahie wo nanhe haath katte, bam or chaaku thaamne ko bekaraar ho rahe hai
 Innocent children from 7 to 16 years are committing serious crimes like robbery, murder, snatching, theft, jebatarashi and rape
 aap ye jaankaar or bhi hairaan rah jaaenge ki in bacchon main ladakiyon kii bhi ek badi jamaat shaamil he jo krime kii kaali duniya main dastak de chuki hai
 After all, why are these children increasingly turning to the world of crime? Are parents responsible for this? Are school colleges responsible? Or are we ignoring the needs of our children in this changing age? Age- ten years
 pesha- lut
 a gang of Delhi's children who have killed the police
 is gang kaa sargana apane chah saathiyon ke saath jis ghar kaa rukh kar letaa wo ghar tabah or barbaad ho jaataa
 The house that this gang of children used to target would burn down
 mouj masti se shuru hota tha un bacchon kaa mishan
 He used to make dangerous plans in sports
 phir chunate the apana shikaar
 They used to have complete accounts of the closed houses, and then they would go on their mission
 bacchon ke mishan khatm hone ke baad vahaan kuch nahin bachataa tha
 There was no door to door living from within
 sab kuch khatm ho jaataa tha
 Only Rakh was seen there
 bacchon kaa ye gang flude lekar chalata tha
 The gang boys were intoxicated by this, and after the theft sprinkled Fluid on the leftovers
 chori ke saboot mitaane kaa jo tarika is giroh ne dhundha wo khataranaak bhi tha or daraavna bhi
 Such was the vicious and dreaded fire gang of children
 gang ke badmaash bacchon ko pehle se khabar ho jaati thi ki koun shaadi main baahar jane vaala he
 Who stays alone in the house, and at what time the flat remains empty
 in khaali gharon main baccha gang ke badmaash bachche dhaava bolte or phir raakh chhod faraar ho jate the
 This kid gang has carried out around 200 incidents
 aisa nahin he ki baccha gang ke badmaash police ke hathe nahin chadhe ye kai baar pakade gaye
 But each time he took advantage of being a minor and kept absconding from a child-improvement home
 inhen bacchon main ek shaks he fir gang kaa sargana sanju
 The same Sanju who has been carrying out robbery and robbery incidents since the age of 10 years
 sanju ne dilli main vaardaaton ko anjaam dene ke liye 8-10 bacchon kaa giroh bana rakhaa tha
 In February 2011, the cat-and-cat game of this gangster of Delhi's fire gang came to an end
 gang kaa ye sargana ab baccha nahin rahaa
 For the first time, he was caught by the police as an adult
 is baar use bal-sudhaar grih nahin le jaaya gaya
 Rather, direct access was delivered behind bars
 ye kaisaa katl?alaav jalaane ke liye log aksar lakdi or koyale kaa istemaal karte hai
 But have you ever heard of such a bonfire? jisamen eendhan ke taur par lakdi ke bajaae insaani jism jala ho
 The soul trembles on hearing it
 magar ye hakeekat he junior gang kii us shaitani karatuut kii jisane baqayada ek katl kiya, or phir alaav ke taur par laash ko aag laga kar apni hatheliyaan garm kin
 This is the dreaded story of kidnapping and murder of junior gang's handicapped children, which no one is convinced
 khaastaur par kidanamping ke baad in naaballigon ne apane saath padhane vaale bachche ko jis tarah agava kiya or katl ke liye jo hatkande apanaae use dekhakar bade se bada peshewar apradhi bhi daanto tale ungali dabaa legaa
 The storyline that began to creep up began with a school in the Girdnibagh area of patna
 yahaan paanchavi class main padhane vaala baarah saal kaa amarjit ek dopaher apane ghar ke paas pados ke bacchon ke saath khel rahaa tha
 When Vijay, who was studying in his class, called him and took him to a nearby rented flat
 flats ke andar vijay ke chaar or dost pehle se hi maujuud the
 Amarjeet was called here by these boys on the pretext of giving ipod
 magar unka iraadaa kuch or hi tha
 On reaching the flat, the boys present there started a scuffle with Amarjeet, and finally the boys strangled Amarjeet and slaughtered him
 magar schuli ladakon ke is gang kaa asal kaam katl ke baad hi shuru hua
 To find Amarjeet's corpse whereabouts, the boys locked his corpse in a sack and waited for the evening to settle down
 andhera hote hi chaaron ladke bore main rakhi amarjit kii laash cycle par ladakar shahar ke ek sunsaan ilaake kii ore chal pade
 Upon reaching here, they sprinkled kerosene oil on the corpse and set it on fire with the intention of erasing the evidence of murder
 is tarah se lagi aag kahin vahaan se guzarane vaale logon ke dimag main shaq paidaa na kare isaliye sabhi ladke uske chaaron ore baith kar aag taapane kaa naatak karne lage
 And in this way, when Amarjeet's corpse was completely burnt, these boys left him there and left him on his way back to their homes
 sabakuch pehle se soch kar banaai gai planning ke mutabik ho rahaa tha
 Whoever heard this sensational incident of the murder of little Amarjeet, understood that Amarjeet's life was lost due to mutual faction and enmity of children
 magar hakeekat ye he ki baarah saal ke amarjit kaa katl darasal ek behad sochi samajhi sajeesh kaa nateeja tha
 At the root of which was millions of rupees
 sajeesh kii shuruuaat teen ladakon ne kii jisamen se aditya or lav amarjit ke hi skool main aathvin or barahavin class main padhate the
 While Suraj used to study in ATI
 plan tha kisi rais ghar ke bachche ko kidanap kar phiroti vasuulana
 For this, Aditya had the responsibility to find and reiki the boy with money
 jabaki lav or suraj ne kidnaping ko amali jama pehanaane kaa plan taiyaar kiya tha
 Under this plan, Amarjeet was first lured into the flat, strangled and then burnt to the corpse with the intention of erasing evidence
 iske fouran baad planning ke mutabik ladakon ne amarjit kii maa ko phiroti ke liye phone kiya
 And demanded a ransom of five lakhs in exchange for Amarjeet's release
 patna ke esaspi bachchu singh meena ne bataaya, ‘use pehle maar diya gaya phir dyspose karke phenkane ke baad tab phiroti kaa kol diya
 He had already taken the mobile number of the child's mother
 usee number par chori ke sim or chori ke set se phiroti kii kol kii gai
 On the date of this call on the 20th, police came into action
 darasal amarjit ko maar kar phiroti vasuulne kii planning bacchon ke is gang ne pehle se hi kar rakhi thi
 Since it was difficult for him to keep Amarjeet imprisoned after the kidnapping, it was everyone's opinion that he be killed immediately after kidnapping
 or us ke baad gharavaalon ko daraakar phiroti vasuul lee jaae
 To make ransom calls to Amarjeet's family, the boys especially used stolen mobiles and stolen SIM cards
 esaspi bachchu singh meena ne kaha, ‘amarjit ke hi skool main padhne vaale aditya aathvi kaa chaatr tha
 Aditya felt that Amarjeet's father is a very rich man and can get a lot of money if he asks for some money by kidnapping
 sabase dukhad baat ye thi ki in logon ne pehle hi tay kar rakhaa tha ki bachche ko bulaakar maar dena he,phir baad main phiroti kii baat kerani he
 
 ’shikanje main junior gangmgar aakhirkaar phiroti vasuulne kii yahi naakaam koshish bacchon ke is gang par baari pad gai
 The number from which the children made calls to collect the ransom, the mobile phone was tracked by the police and in this way, this dreadful truth of the children was revealed to everyone
 haalanki sab kuch jaanane ke baavjood logon ke liye ab bhi is par yakeen karnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Principal of KPS school
s
 en
 Sharma says, "it is not imaginable to burn a child's body and burn it, but we think the master minds are big boys who have instigated the children for such work
" ’magar bacchon ne jab apana jurm apni jubaan se kubula to yakeen karne ke sivaa logon ke paas koi chaara bhi nahin tha
 Accused student Aditya said, 'after killing him, lock him in a sack and burn him
 chori kaa mobile laayaa usase uski maa ko phonkar bolaa ki paanch lakh rupaya chahie
 Then after throwing his body near the Sipara bridge and throwing the bicycle near the Zakkanpur police station, we came
 ’ek hi class or ek hi skool main padhane vaale beraham haathon ne amarjit kaa katl kar daalaa, lekin chaunkiye mat khun se sane ye naaballig haath yaheen nahin ruke unhone us bachche kii laash ko bore me band kar pehle jalaayaa or phir tabatak usapar apni hatheliyaan senkate jabatak uski shinaakht kaa dar nahin khatm ho gaya
 This type of crime in children makes the thinking graph
 aakhir kyon masuumon kii maasoomiyat gum hoti ja rahi he? aakhir kyon us maasoomiyat kii jagah le rahaa he junun? ek aisa junun
 Which is taking them into the darkness of crimes
 baccha gang, fire gang, jhapatpaar gang or bacchon ke gang ke naa jane kya-kya naam hai
 These children are small in age but their intentions are very dangerous
 yakeen maniye neshnal krime ricard beuro ke aankadon kaa sach behad chaunkaane vaala he
 According to this bitter truth, about 34 thousand children are being arrested every year in the case of crime in India
 in 34 hajaar bacchon main kareeb do hajaar naaballig ladkiyaan bhi jurm main shaamil hai
 In these, action has been taken on 29 thousand children under IPC sections, while 5 thousand have been found involved in Special and Local Law
 dilli kamishan for protection of child raits ke chairman amod kanth kehete hai, ‘krime badha he, lekin duniya main kishoron dwaara kiye krime pratishat se india main ye rate ab bhi kam he
 'surprisingly, the maximum number of children caught during crime is 16 to 18 years old, whose average is 63
 5 fisadi he 12 se 16 saal tak ke bacchon kii taadaat 33
 It is 2 percent
 jabaki, krime karne vaale 7 se 12 saal ke bachche 3
 3 percent
 is saal yani 2011 main aparaadhik maamalon main pakade gaye 48 bacchon main se 17 qatl or lut jaise sangeen maamalon main shaamil paae gaye hai
 It is also a matter of concern in this new trend of garayam that many gangs who commit crime of children are taking advantage of the child law, they are organized in order to get them involved in drug smuggling, theft and jewelery
 aise main agar koi baccha kahin pakadaa bhi jaae to asli mulgim police kii pakad main nahi aata or bal kanoon ke tahat baccha thode vakt baad reeha ho jaataa he
 In today's era, expensive clothes, expensive trains, and girlfriends at a young age are pushing children into the world of gerium
 aise main bacchon ke maa-baap ye jimmedaari he ki wo apane bacchon kaa khaas khyaal rakhen or taaki unka shauk ek andhaa junun main naa ban jaae
 The crime rate of children is increasing not only in Delhi but all over the country
 lekin rajdhani main hone vaale aparaadhon kaa aankada
 The most shocking of all
 kachi umr main hi chote-chote bachche
 Such serious crimes like murder, robbery and rape are being carried out and it is a matter of concern that the number of such children is increasing day by day
 neshnal krime record beuro ke aankade behad daraane vaale he
 Children in the country's capital are also stepping into the world of crime
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki in aparaadhiyo kii umr mahaz 10 se 16 saal ke bich he
 If you look at the statistics of the crime and crime of children, then you will be surprised
 rajdhani dilli main saal 2009 main hi hatya ke 72, hatya ke prayaas ke 36, gaiyr iradatan hatya ke 31, rape ke 14, agava karne ke 14, dakaiti or lutpaat ke 54, sendhamari or chori ke 207 maamle yani kul 586 aapraadhik maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 Of these, 518 were apprehended for the first time while 68 were children with continuous crime
 bharat main bacchon main teji se bad rahe krime rate kaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kul 586 bacchon main se 518 bachein wo hai jinhone pehali baar jurm kii duniya main dastak di he
 This crime graph has made the Delhi Police sleepless
 ye hi vajah he ki kai enjio, dilli police or sarkari sansthano ne mil kar aise baccho ko sudhaarney ke liye khaas program chalaanaa shuru kiya he
 The need of the hour in this fast running life is that parents should hold hands of their children and take care of their needs
 taaki in masuumon ko kaali duniya ke is daldal se mahfuz rakhaa ja sake
 On the podium of India's largest youth festival India Today # mindrocks16, young Congress leader Sachin Pilot said without any doubt that Rahul Gandhi should now take over as chair as soon as possible
 unhone kaha ki rahul main desh kaa netritv karne kii kshamta he or unke adhyaksh banane se party ko nai takat milegi
 Minister Anupriya Patel and AAP leader Raghav Chadha were also present on the dais with Sachin Pilot
 kaarykram main raghav chaddha ne kaha ki unki party ne logon ko raajnneeti menne vikalpadene kii koshish kii he, jisase abtak janata kaa khub saath mila he

 ye ek bharosa or janata ke vishwaas kaa nateeja he
 He said that the party is also fully prepared to give new options in politics in other states
 unase jab shaadi ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki meri shadirajnneetike saath ho chuki he
 At the same time, the question was asked about the meeting with minister Anupriya Patel in political heritage
 is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki viraasat main mili raajnneetik shuruyaat main to madad karti he lekin aage kii raah khud tay kerani hoti he
 According to Anupriya Patel, the public is smarter and she now pays attention to the face that belongs to her rather than inheritance and that resolves their problem

 On the ten-year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack, the U
 S
 stands with the people of India in their quest for justice
 The attack killed 166 innocents, including six Americans
 We will never let terrorists win, or even come close to winning! Describing the Mumbai terrorist attack as 'barbaric', US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Pakistan and other countries to fulfill their obligations to the UN Security Council to enforce sanctions against those responsible for this brutality

 The Foreign Ministry said that since 26 November 2008, a total of 10 terrorists belonging to lashkar-e-taiba have carried out series of coordinated attacks at several places in Mumbai
 unhone kaha, ‘america 2008 mumbai hamale ke liye jimmedaaron kii pahchaan karne or unhen nyaay ke daayre main laane ke liye apane antarrashtriya saajhedaaron ke saath kaam karne ko patibaddh he

 With regard to making Ramapati Ram Tripathi a candidate, it is believed that BJP has tried to find caste equations for Deoria
 bijepi ke is kadam ko lekar sthaneey logon main milijuli pratikriya dekhne ko mili
 One side believes that it is a misfortune for Deoria to field an external candidate again after Kalraj Mishra, while the other side says that by bringing in candidates from outside, the BJP has acted to stop the local camp
 devaria sthit baba raghavdas degree college (biardeepi) main raajnneeti shaastra ke professor dow
 Samarendra Bahadur Singh Ramapathi considers Ram Tripathi's nomination to be non-logical
 unka kahana he ki, ‘bijepi kaa sthaneey kaaryakarta saalon bhar jhande binar lekar party ke liye kaam karata he
 Be it cold, rainy, hot, it works for the party in every season, but as soon as it comes to contest elections, the external candidate is brought and imposed
 ’ unhone kaha ki sthaneey pratyaashee se log milane main sahajata mahasoos karte hai
 They call in marriage, feel an intimacy, there is no talk on the outside
 vahiin ek rashtriya dainik ke sthaneey sanskaran main patrkaar shashikant mishra kehete hai ki devaria main kai logon ke naamon ko lekar kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki unhen pratyaashee banaaya ja saktaa he, lekin bijepi kaa yah faisla chaunkaane vaala he
 However, he believes that this will not make much difference to the core voters of the BJP
 patrkaar vijay paswan kehete hai ki sthaneey pratyaashee hota to uskaa paksh zyada majboot hota, vah logon se aasaani se mil paata
 But it will take a long time for the external candidate to reconcile with the local public and there is not much time left in the election

 He said, 'actually, it is compulsory to send external candidates to BJP in Deoria, there was one candidate in every locality here
 ’ lekin vah yah bhi kahati hai ki bahari pratyaashee lekar sthaneey logon main naaraazgi he, vah naaraazgi soshal media main bhi dikh rahi he

 She believes that this can have an impact on voting, she says that there can be two things either the NOTA button will be overburdened or the voting percentage will be affected
 juuta cond ke zikr par vah kahati hai ki devaria main rajput or brahman kaa sawaal kaayam he
 Obviously the shoe scandal will remain in the air

 Rejecting the contention of the external candidate, he said that this is not an issue at all
 sthaneey str par party main kai gut ban gaye the
 Everyone was claiming
 lihaaja bijepi kii survey team ne acha suzav diya or party ne usee ke anusaar kadam uthaaya hoga
 AP Jaiswal believes that Deoria's political and caste equations will be helpful to Ramapati Ram Tripathi

 Since then, there are misunderstandings between Karan and Disha and this is also believed to be the reason for his not appearing in the show
 lekin is bare main karan johar or disha paatani kii ore se koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 Tiger had this bad habit in his childhood, so Jackie kept the name of the film Baghi 2, so the promotion of the film is going on in full swing, the film will be released on March 30

 tippaniyan Vikram started with Tamil films and later worked in Telugu and Malayalam films
 unhone ‘sethu’, ‘sami’, ‘anniyan’ or ‘kantaswami’ anya charchit filmon main kaam kiya he

 i am not doing (bollywood) films for money
 iske bajaay mujhe yahaan bhi utana hi paisa mil rahaa he
 He said, i wanted to do something different here (in Bollywood) and 'ravana' and 'david' gave me this opportunity
 yah satya he ki hindi filmon kii pahunch bahut zyada he
 It is seen globally, but this was not the reason for doing the film here
 vikram ne tamil filmon se shuruyaat kii or baad main telugu or malayalam filmon main kaam kiya
 He has worked in other popular films like 'sethu', 'sami', 'anniyan' and 'kantaswamy'
 vikram ne kaha, meraa vahaan pehle se hi kariyar he
 He just got the offer from Hindi films and i liked it so i did it
 main (bollywood kii) filmein paise ke liye nahin kar rahaa
 Instead i am getting the same amount of money here

 mulk kii aazaadee ke sattar saal guzar chuke hai
 In these 70 years, the Muslims of the country have seen many ups and downs and have faced many challenges
 iske baavjood musalamaanon ke andar ek behatar jindagi kii ummid kii lau hameshaa jalati rahi or unki ankhon main iskaa khwab sajata rahaa he
 Where and under what condition is the Muslim of the country today after so long after independence
 is mudde par aajtak
 in interacted with all the Muslim intellectuals of the country
 musalamaanon kaa nuksaan modi se zyada nehru ne kiyapurv saansad eliyas aazmi kehete hai- musalamaanon kii jindagi ko jitna nuksaan jawahar lala nehru ne 1947 se 1964 ke bich main pahunchaaya he, utana to narendra modi pachaas saal main bhi nahin pahunchaa sakate
 During Nehru's time the condition of Muslims was so bad that four Muslims could not stand together and talk
 muslim kaum puri tarah ehsaas-e-kamatari kaa shikaar ho chuki thi
 The participation of Muslims in jobs, education and politics was completely abolished
 nehru ke is sajeesh main jamiyat ulma-e-hind ke adhyaksh rahe moulana hossain ahamed madani bhi shaamil rahe
 In the era of Nehru and Indira, the curtains and the dirty streets of Tat were the hallmarks of Muslim settlements
 musalamaanon kaa golden periodilias aazmi kehete hai ki musalamaanon ke khoe hue aatmavishvaas ko waapas laane main dow
 Faridi has played an important role
 muslim majalish ke jariye unhone musalamaanon ke andar se ehsaas-e-kamatari ko khatm kiya
 The golden period for Muslims was from 1977 to 2009 in the seventy years of independence
 isi dauraan desh ke saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik sabhi kshetron main musalamaanon kii hissedari badi or vikaas kii disha main behatar kadam uthaae gaye
 The Muslims of the country stood with the rest of the society, after 2009 an atmosphere has been created against the Muslims
 vartmaan main modi kii sarkaar he, kuch chijen jarur musalamaanon ke khilaaf ho rahi hai, lekin nehru ke daur kii tarah musalamaanon ko haashie par nahin dhakela ja saktaa, kyonki ab 1947 ke daur vaala musalmaan nahin he
 Today's Muslim is ready to die
 apane haq kii ladaai main peeche nahin hatega
 The threat to the freedom of democracy, Professor Imtiaz Ahmed says that at the time of independence of the country, which was the meaning and concept of independence
 aaj kii paristhiti main us par khatra mandara rahaa he
 Unity diversity, which is our social specialty, is being taken back
 nateeja ye he ki hamaare freedom ke saath-saath desh kii loktantric vyavastha par bhi khatra he
 Whether the freedom gained in 1947 will survive or not
 asuraksha kii bhaavana main ji rahaa musalmaandesh kiaazadee ke 70 salmen musalamaanon ne jo tarakkee kii he
 It has not been through the government level, but unfortunately it has been given by the market forces
 musalmaan baazaaroo sambhaavnaaon kaa phayda uthaakar pragatisheel or madhyavarg ke baraabar khadaa hua he
 But he has also suffered property attacks through communal riots
 pichley do-teen saalon main paristhitiyaan kaaphi najuk hui hai
 As a minority, the security that Muslims should have got, unfortunately that protection has come down
 unhen lagata he ki aazaadee ke samay samvidhan ke jariye unhen jo aazaadee mili thi wo bachegi bhi yaa nahin
 The Muslim is living in the spirit of security
 aaj hindutvvaadi soch or state ke andar taanaashaahee pravriti aa rahi he, uski dein he ki gaurakshak logon ko saream maar rahe hai
 It is now difficult to breathe in the freedom that was attained 70 years ago
 musalamaanon main tarakkee-khushhalipurv rajyasabha sadsy va patrkaar shahid siddiki kehete hai ki 70 saal main desh kaa musalmaan aage badha he or jindagi ke har kshetra main tarakkee kar rahaa he
 With the belief that his future is safe in the country
 bangladesh banane ke baad desh kaa musalmaan ird-gird dekhnaa band kar apane bhavishya ko savanrane ke liye menstream kaa hissaa ban gaya he
 Of course there are many problems and challenges today, but in the changing environment, the new breed of Muslims wants to change their thinking and work, that is the reason why today in the world, Muslims are facing the worst condition
 bharat main na to vah kisi kattarwadi sonch se judaa he auki na hi kisi aatankwaadi raste par he
 He is looking for new avenues and a new world by relying solely on the Constitution of India
 maujuuda daur main jo chunautiyaan hai unase ladane ke liye do hi raste hai, pehla shiksha or doosraa aarthik rup se sabal hona
 By following these two paths, a Muslim can remove the darkness and disperse the light
 khatre main dharmik aazaadeemoulana salmaan nadvi kehete hai ki aazaadee ke 70 saal ke baad bhi desh ke musalamaanon ko apni rashtrabhakti kaa saboot dena padataa he
 Whereas Muslims have made the most sacrifices in the independence of the country
 iske baavjood hamaari vafadari par shaq kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In the current era, religious freedom of Muslims is being targeted, sometimes three divorces, sometimes through common civil code
 itnaa hi nahin madrason ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The spirits of communal forces are so high that Muslims are being killed publicly
 desh kaa saamaajik tanabana bighad chukaa he
 In such a situation, freedom is no longer important
 desh kii tahjeeb par atarrligarh muslim university itihaas vibhaag ke professor mohammad sajaad kehete hai ki musalmaan desh kii aazaadee se lekar saanskrithik or saamaajik prayek rup main bhagidaar rahaa he
 The reason behind this is their trust in secularism and mixed culture
 samvidhan bhi usee tahjeeb ke tahat bana, jisamen sabhi samaaj ko barabari di gai
 In the last few years, the influence of right-wing forces has increased the dangers on this heritage of the country
 in 70 saalon main musalamaanon ke aarthik halaat sudharne ke saath-saath panchayatiraj main bhi unka pratinidhitiv badha he
 Which became the reason for jealousy of Muslims in other societies, through this, right-wing forces got a chance to spread their foothold
 lekin mujhe ummid he ki dakshinpanthi takate bharat main bahut lambey samay tak nahin rah sakengi
 There is a very delicate phase in front of the Muslim Muslims who have become progressive and leave conservative thinking, in such a situation, they should be self-conscious
 roodhiwaadee soch se upar uthakar progressive soch ke saath aage aana hoga
 Not only this, like a common citizen, vote silently on the party of your choice, but question all parties, not only BJP
 iske alaava desh ke musalamaanon ko desh ke baaki samaaj ke saath milakar apane mudde uthaane chahie
 Instead of uniting on an orthodox issue like the Shahabans, unite on concrete economic issues
 kisaanon kii samasya ,vikaas ke mudde or saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai main barabari se khadey hon

 aam aadmi party sarkaar kii 40 se zyada services vaali home delivery yojana par philhal brake lag gaya he
 LG Anil Baijal has returned the file to the Kejriwal government, counting about a dozen objections to the 'door step delivery' scheme
 maamle main dipti siem manish sisodiya ne alji kii manshaa par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 During the press conference at Delhi Secretariat, Sisodia responded to every objection raised by LG on the 'door step delivery' scheme
 yojana ke bare main bataate hue sisodiya ne kaha ki 16 november ko 40 services kii home delivery karne kaa faisla cabinet ne liya tha
 According to government statistics, only 25 lakh people are using these 40 services every year
 sisodiya ne aage kaha, 'door step delivery main sarkaar se certificate, driving license jaisi anya suvidha ek kol par aapke ghar aegi
 Now one has to go to the government office or fill the online form
 is prakriya se form bharne main gadabadi ho sakati he
 Frequent office visits also have to be cut, but under the 'door step delivery' scheme, a mobile assistant will come to your door
 fees, kagajaat ke alaava mashin se ungaliyon ke nishaan lagane kii suvidha ghar par muhaiyaa karai jaaegi
 The Kejriwal government claims that the mobile-assistant going to the home to provide services will be able to go to the public at the appointed time and date
 iske baad janata us karmchaaree kaa feedback bhi de sakati he
 Sisodia told that LG Sahab has raised objections by returning the file
 alji kaa kahana he ki 40 main se 35 sarvice digital ho chuki he or door step delivery kii zarurat nahin he
 LG says the scheme will increase security hassles, increase corruption, lose papers or increase field trips, which will increase pollution
 lekin aam aadmi partisarkaarka maananaa he ki digital delivery se aage badhkar kuch karnaa hoga
 Because this scheme of the government is not a delivery scheme but a super delivery scheme
 sisodiyaka kahana he ki alji ne alag-alag ilaakon main centre kholane kii salaah di he, jahaan log jaakar kagajaat de saken or ghar ke nazadik sarkari prakriya puri kar saken
 But it was not good for anyone to set up such a center
 pehle kii dilli sarkaar ne jivan centre banaaya tha jo fail model tha, isse bhrashtachar bad gaya tha
 Questioning LG, Sisodia said that LIC agents and Pizza Man come home, are they a threat to safety? The entire online industry is set on door step delivery, should they stop? This plan of the government is to save the bribe of the bastard or broker
 sisodiya ne kaha, 'ab sawaal yah uthta he ki chuni hui sarkaar itnaa bada faisal kare to kya niyukt alji ke paas is faisle ko radd karnaa chahie?' aam aadmi party sarkaar ne ummid jataai he ki supreme court dwaara faisla dete vaqt main is tarah ke maamle kaa dhyaan rakhaa jayega

 He also mentioned that the government adopts the strategy of 'mistake and correction' many times in the policy making process because sometimes it does not have complete information and the environment is also uncertain

 All signs were pointing to the announcement of Nitin Patel's name before the announcement of Vijay Rupani as the 16th Chief Minister of Gujarat at 5 pm on August 6
 yahaan tak ki khud roopaani chaar din pehle apane sathwein janmdiwas ke utsav par is baat se muthamuin dikh rahe the ki party kii pasand patel hi honge
 That is why when Patel reached Kamalam, the state headquarters of the BJP, the workers welcomed him as the future Chief Minister
 patel kaa mukhyamantri bananaa itnaa tay jaan padataa tha ki sthaneey tivi channel unki patni ke intervyuu chalaane lage the or unase pratikriya le rahe the
 The outgoing Chief Minister Anandiben Patel wanted Nitin Patel as his successor, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not make up his mind till the last moment
 unhone party adhyaksh amit shah se kaha tha ki roopaani is pad ke liye upyukt hai
 Shah himself is believed to have wanted Rupani because he loved the humble language and efficient way of getting work done by Rupani, who was the Minister for Transport and Labor in Anandiben's government
 aisa lagata he ki modi or shah ke is kathin or apratyaashit faisle ke peeche kuch jatil siyaasi ganit rahaa hoga
 Despite being Patel, Anandiben failed to stop the movement of this community on reservation
 ve gaiyr-patel votaron ko bhi ekajute rakhane main naakaam ho gai thim, jinamein se adhiktar unke kaam karne ke tareeke ke kaaran chhitak gaye the
 One thing in favor of Rupani (who is also the current state BJP president) is that he is a skilled negotiator
 sabase ahm yah baat he ki unke sir par koi siyaasi boj nahin he jo unhen gira sake: unhen lekar patelon yaa obisi main koi katutaa nahin he
 The same thing appealed to Modi and Shah in view of next year's assembly elections
 pichley 25 varsh ke dauraan bijepi kaa yah sabase tagada imtihaan rahaa he jab patel or dalit bhadke hue hai jo gujarat kii kul aabaadi main 23 fisadi hissedari rakhte hai
 Two examples might help explain why Rupani has been so relied on for understanding in electoral and party matters
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan roopaani saurashtra or kuccha ke prabharee the
 There was speculation in the media that Saurashtra's Patels have gone against Modi and the BJP is sure to lose in its own stronghold
 matdaan se thik pehle roopaani ne ek patrkaar ko bataaya ki bijepi 57 main se 42 siten jeet sakati he
 The party ultimately won 43 seats
 paanch saal baad jab gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri keshubhai patel ne bijepi se istipha diya or apni gujarat parivartan party banaai, tab roopaani ne modi se aagrah kiya ki ve is ho-halle kii chintaa na karen or aashwaasan diya ki bijepi us kshetra se kam se kam 35 siten jeet kar laaegi
 The election result of the party remained exactly the same
 lambey samay se party ke vafaadaar rahe roopaani kaa chunavi raajnneeti main ubhaar kaaphi chamatkaarik rahaa he
 He won his first election in 2014
 bijepi ne unhen rajkot pashchim kii seat se ladgaye ko namankit kiya tha kyonki vajubhai vaala ko karnataka kaa rajyapal niyukt kar diya gaya tha
 In November the same year he was taken into the cabinet
 agle farvari main ve rajya bijepi ke adhyaksh bana die gaye
 Rupani may have become an MLA in 2014 but he is one of the senior-most leaders of the Gujarat BJP
 ve chaatrajivan main abivipi ke kaaryakarta rahe or immergency kaa virodh karne ke liye 19 saal kii umr main jail gaye
 He was a Sangh activist and remained associated with the party since the inception of the BJP
 roopaani gujarat main kai cametiyon ke sadsy rah chuke hai, kai baar bijepi kii rajya ikai ke mahasachiv rah chuke hai or gujarat paryaton board ke purv chairman bhi hai
 He was a Rajya Sabha MP from 2006 to 2012
 roopaani gujarat ke pehle jain mukhyamantri hai
 This community accounts for one percent of the population of Gujarat
 unka pehla imtihaan janvari main yojit hone vaale global invester summit 'wibrant gujarat' main hona he
 It was this event that brought Modi on the national plank
 anubhav kii tamaam kamiyon ke bich roopaani ne kaaphi aatmavishvaas ke saath nai pari shuru kii he or 25 sadasyon kii apni cabinet main aath nae chehre shaamil kiye hai
 Nine faces of Anandiben's government have been removed, including some senior ones
 party ke andruni logon kaa kahana he ki aisa karnaa jaruri tha taaki satta ke kai kendron ko dhwast kiya ja sake or yah sandesh diya ja sake ki kaman ek ke haath main hi he
 Nitin Patel has been appointed as Deputy Chief Minister, while Finance and Energy Minister Saurabh Patel has been seen
 yah faisla achraj paidaa karata he, kyonki unhen gujarat ke sabase sakasham mantriyon main mana jaataa rahaa he
 He was also the force behind the power reforms
 umr, jati or kshetreey pratinidhitiv ke maamle main anyathaa 'santulit' mantrimandal se saurabh patel kii vidaai ne logon ko chaunkaa diya he
 There is speculation that Rupani may have to bear some of the loss of not keeping Saurabh Patel in his court
 kai kaarobaari puch rahe hai ki wibrant gujarat sammelan main yadi saurabh patel kii nahin, to phir kiski nigaraanee hogi, jinhone itani ahm bhoomika isamen nibhaai thi? unki kshamtaaon se haalanki shaayad hi koi inkaar karata ho or atakalein hai ki modi shaayad dilli main unka aage istemaal karen
 Rupani's biggest challenge is to bring the Patels into the BJP fold
 unke vaartakar ke kaushal kaa sabase tagada imtihaan isi morche par hoga
 Nitin Patel will prove to be his important ally in this task, even if he is a little disappointed with not being made the Chief Minister
 gramin gujarat ke patel jo is samudaay ke kul matadaataaon kaa do-tihaai hai, unhone aarakshan ke mudde par bijepi ke khilaaf baghawat kar di he
 He was harshly dealt with during the August 2015 agitation and his leader Hardik Patel was sued for treason, leading to nine months in prison
 is vajah se unka asantosh or gaharaaya hua he
 The way the BJP is concerned in the November 2015 district and taluka panchayat elections clearly shows the disenchantment of the Patels
 gujarat se chah maheene baahar rahane ke adalati aadesh ke kaaran hardik aajkal udaipur main rah rahe hai lekin unki maujuudagi yahaan gahare mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 On Rupani being made the chief minister, Hardik immediately remarked that the BJP had insulted the Patels by projecting Nitinbhai as the CM and leaving him controversial
 '' unhone maang kii ki ''nitinbhai virodh main istipha den
 Another major problem of Rupani is the increasing anger among the Dalits
 anandiben ko hataae jane kaa faisla liya hi ja rahaa tha ki amadabad se una tak ek dalit padayatra kaa elaan kar diya gaya taaki ''bijepi ke model rajya main daliton ke khilaaf ho rahe utpeeda par logon ko jaagruk kiya ja sake
 "keep in mind that last month, in Una itself, goons beat up Dalit youth in the name of cow protection
 is ghatana kii footage viral ho jane ke baad se party par itnaa zyada dabaav bana ki khud modi ko gorakshakon ke khilaaf kadaa bayaan jari karnaa padaa
 The Gujarat unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is not ready to spare him, stating that when the Prime Minister was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he himself praised the cow protection
 ''rajnatik vishleshak vidyut thaakar kehete hai ki gaiyr-patel mukhyamantri kaa chayan party ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 "the bjp's national leadership is embracing electoral suicides by choosing non-patel cms," he says
 patel vot puraa kaa puraa congress ko chalaa jayega
 "another Japanese analyst disagrees with this
" ve kehete hai, ''roopaani ek behtareen vaartakar hai or chunaav laduya jaanate hai
 You cannot take them lightly, nor can you ignore the feeling of Gujaratis for Modi
 ve ek aise shaks ko nicha nahin dikhaa sakate jise ve mahatma gandhi, sardaar patel or morarji desai ke baad rajya kaa chauthaa ratan maanate hai
 "the question is that by choosing Rupani, is the BJP ready to play and win its election bets without Patel votes?" a large section of backward in rural areas and even upper caste voters are angry with Patel
 ve maanate hai ki aarakshan kii unki maang ochhi he kyonki unki aarthik haisiyat majboot he
 If Patel did not come with the BJP, then Rupani might play on anti-patel sentiment
 saurasht ke obisi samudaay main unki gahari paith he or unhone mantrimandal main unki numaaindgi kaa acha khyaal rakhaa he
 In his new role he will have to achieve success using all these qualities
 modi ke jane ke baad gujarat kii naukarshahi main bhrashtachar badha he
 One of Rupani's challenges is cleaning up this corruption
 vipakshi congress party ko bharosa he ki aakhri maukey par mukchaymantri badalane se koi khaas fark nahin padegaa
 The party's promoter Manish Doshi calls it a "game of musical chair"
 ve kehete hai, ''yah bijepi ko bachaa nahin paaegaa
 The bjp's defeat in 2017 is clearly visible due to failure
 '' raajnneeti main jaahir he ki kuch bhi tay nahin hota
 Who will know better than Rupani and Nitin Patel! madhya pradesh ke bhopal main ek 12 saal kii ek bacchee ke saath kathith taur par rape or hatya kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The incident is on Tuesday

 After the rape, the accused crushed the girl's head with a stone and killed her

 jiske baad police ne bacchee kii rishtedaar samet pados main rahane vaale donon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he

 bhopal se bijepi pratyaashee pragna thakur ne is maamle main siem kamalnath or congress sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he

 'news agency pitiai ke mutabik, bijepi netaa pragna thakur ne bacchee kii maa se bhi mulaakaat thi jinhen gaharaa sadma laga he

 is ghatana ke baad puure desh main pradarshan hua tha or aropiyon ke liye maut kii sajaa kii maang kii gai thi
 At that time, CM Kamal Nath was the Leader of the Opposition
 unhone kaha tha, madhya pradesh rape ke maamle me puure desh main sabase zyada badnaam he, ye ghatnaayen kab rukegin? hamaari bahanon or betiyon ko kab surakshit maahaul milegaa?'gauratlab he ki madhyapradesh se rape ke kai maamle saamne aa chuke hai

 com / 6eqxw2n3ll— Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar)february 24, 2017 At present, each train with Link Halfman Bush (LHB) coaches has one to two generator bogies
 inhen dijal janarator bogiyon se sabhi dibbon ko bijli kii aapurti kii jaati he
 It is known as 'end on Generation' (EOG) technology
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki jald hi vibhaag duniya bhar main prachlit 'head on jenereshan' (echoji) praudyogiki kaa istemaal shuru karne ja rahaa he
 In this technology, electricity is taken from the wiring to the top of the train to the coaches as well
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki oktober 2019 se bhartiya rail ke kareeb 5,000 dibbe echoji praudyogiki se parichaalit hone lagenge
 This will help in removing generator bogies from trains and will also facilitate the installation of additional coaches in them
 itnaa hi nahin isse railway kii eendhan par salanaa 6,000 karod rupee se adhik kii bachat hogi
 To supply power to only one non-air conditioned compartment, 120 units of electricity are required per hour
 itani bijli paidaa karne ke liye janarator prati ghanta 40 litre dijal kii khapat karata he
 At the same time, this consumption of fuel for air-conditioned coaches increases to 65 to 70 liters of diesel per hour
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki nai pranali paryaavaran anukool he
 There will be no air and noise pollution
 saath hi yah prayek railgadee ke hisaab se carbon utsarjan main 700 ton vaarshik kii kami laaegi
 According to officials, 'for example two generator bogies are installed in each Shatabdi Express
 jab ham echoji pranali ko istemaal karnaa shuru kar denge to aisi trainon main standby ke liye maatr ek janarator bogi kii jarurat hogi
 Officials said that according to their estimates, when all trains with LHB coaches start running with new technology, about four lakh berths will be available every day from additional coaches
 isse railway kii aay bhi badhegi
 Cricket fans are going to fulfill their old dream through IPL-6

 These two biggest batsmen of their era are part of Mumbai Indians
 sachin tendulkarek baar phir mumbai indians kii kaman sanbhaalane ko taiyaar hai to riki ponting bhi is team se jud gaye hai
 Mumbai Indians bet on Ricky Ponting and become the world's luckiest team

 Now two of the biggest batsmen of modern cricket will be seen together
 sachin tendulkar kaa master classor riki ponting kaa power
 These two veterans of the same round spent the bulk of their careers challenging each other
 sachin ne test or vanade main sabase zyada ranon kaa kirtiman banaaya to unka peechha karte ponting donon formet main duusare number par rahe
 Sachin has 15645 runs in Tests and 18426 runs in odis
 record book main sachin ke baad khadey ponting ke nanm test main 13378 or vanade main 13704 ran hai
 Even in the midst of this match, both of them had immense respect for each other but, whenever Sachin and Ponting hit the ground, they proved to be the biggest problem for each other
 sachin ne kai baar ponting kii team ke sapane tode
 On the other hand, Ponting also did not allow Sachin's dream to be fulfilled many times
 ek- duusare ko chunauti dete in do diggajon ne cricket kaa puraa itihaas hi badal diya
 At that time, Sachin and Ponting's fans imagined many times that what would be the batting picture if these two giants play together in a team
 ye sapana ab puraa ho gaya
 In IPL-6, Sachin and Ponting will be part of the same team ie Mumbai Indian
 ab sawaal sirf ye he ki kya ponting ke saath aane se sachin kaa ipel jeetne kaa sapana puraa hoga? He said that we in the Northeast are committed to strengthening our party and winning the trust of the people again
 saath hi unhone kaha ki vah party ke liye mehnat karne vaale prayek congress kaaryakarta kaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum

 Former Union Minister Pachauri said here that the Congress government in the state had promised to waive up to two lakh loans of farmers in its promissory note, the process of debt waiver started as soon as the Congress was formed under the leadership of Kamal Nath

 However, farmers are still getting notice from banks

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that you will come to know on May 23 when the results of the Lok Sabha elections will come
 mujhe pen drive bhejne kaa koi matlab nahin
 Shivraj further said that Rahul Gandhi had said that the debt of farmers will be forgiven within 10 days after forming the government
 yah ab tak nahin hua he
 The former CM said that the Congress has cheated millions of farmers
 congress ko mere paas bank kagajaat lekar aana chahie

 ) After the demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupees, a huge increase in cashless transactions is being recorded
 petm, freecharge or mobiquik jaise mobile wolet kaa istemaal bhi bad gaya he
 Those people are also doing online transactions who are not even aware that their smartphone can be hacked at any time and hackers can blow money from their accounts
 blike hat havers ke liye smartphone hack karnaa baayen haath kaa khel he or ek baar smartphone hack ho gaya to cashles tranjaction aapke liye kisi bure sapane se kam nahin hoga
 If seen, all the tools used in online transactions are not free from danger
 credit, debit card, internet banking hon yaa phir i-wolet in sabhi ko hack karnaa naammumkin nahin he
 a case of online fraud comes on the day
 haal hi main atm frod kaa maamal to aapako yaad hi hoga
 This is why cashless transactions in India are dangerous security updates - Most people in India have smartphones that either do not have new software updates or even if they are ignited due to the slow internet
 jaahir he jis smartphone main nae apadet or security ptch nahin milenge wo haikar ke liye soft torget kaa kaam karegaa
 That is, the older the smartphone, the greater the danger
 HTTPS ke bare main kam he jaankaree:aamtaur par tranjaction ke vakt log ye dekhte kii us conection ke URL main HTTPS he yaa nahin
 Simply put, if there is a padlock icon on the left side of the browser's URL box, then it is HTTPS if it is not secure
 HTTPS vaala conection nahin he to samaj lijie kii aap lutane vaale hai
 History and Cache: Do you remember when was the last time you cleared history and cache from your smartphone's browser? History and cache are stored in your mobile, so it is even easier for hackers to get information about your online transactions

 Smartphone lock: If you keep a smartphone lock is a good thing, but there are still many users who do not keep their mobile lock
 agar smartphone lock nahin hoga, to bas aap haikar kii jad main jaldi hi aa jaaenge
 Because hackers are not on any other planet, they are either of you, do you know any of your friends? pop ap:smartphone main internet yani vigyapanon kii bharmaar
 a pop-up is also an add-on that entices you with interesting headings
 aap na chaah kar bhi clic kar dete hai or phir aap haikar ke control main hote hai
 If not today, tomorrow they will try to break into your online transaction

 New security patches are actually provided through new updates which protect the browser from being hacked and malware
 isliye puraane internet broujar ke jariye hone vaale tranjaction or bhi zyada khatarnaak ho jate hai
 Digital Certification: Is Digital Certification Focused On Online Transactions? Digital services like verisign provide security to websites
 broujar ke main URL ke baayin taraf logo hota he use dekh len
 Because there is certification, it cannot be cloned

 com / bcvy9umsrj— BCCI (@bcci)june 11, 2017 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi on Thursday once again called upon the youth, saying that they should take responsibility to change politics and make it clean
 punjab vishvavidhyalay parisar main congress kii chaatr ikai bhartiya rashtriya chaatr sangh (enesayuai) kii raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne kaha, "ham chaahate hai ki aap raajnneeti main aaen, ise saaf-suthri banaaen or ise badalen
 " unhone kaha, "main pichley aath varsho se raajnneeti main hum
 i have noticed that there is no good participation of the youth in this
 chaahe naukariyon kii baat ho, bhrashtachar dur karnaa ho yaa vikaas kii baat ho, keval aap hi samaadhaan hai
 You have to run the country
 aapke paas aisa karne kii shakti va gyaan he
 " rahul ne kaha ki enesayuai tathaa yuva congress ne hi yuvaaon ko raajnneeti main aane ke sabase adhik maukey die
 He said, "the doors of politics were closed for you
 hamane unhen enesayuai tathaa yuva congress main kholaa
 Today, there are also millions of youth in our organization who have no relatives in politics
 " Taking a dig at the Punjab government, Rahul said that seven out of 10 youth in the state had a problem of drug addiction
 rajya sarkaar yuvaaon ko berogari bhatte bhi nahin de rahi he
 Money was sent from the center to give scholarships to students belonging to scheduled castes and tribes, but the state government did not use it and returned it
 tippaniyan Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the National Democratic Alliance of its leadership for the Congress's unfounded criticism, Rahul said, "our government brought in foreign direct investment (FDI)
" yah kisaanon ko unka haq detaa he
 When BJP and NDA were in power at the Center, they did not oppose FDI
 ab hamane epadiai kii anumati di he to ve iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 When we brought the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) and the bill on land acquisition, he also opposed it
 " The Congress General Secretary alleged that the opposition wants to stop the works by doing so
 punjab vishvavidhyalay parisar main congress kii chaatr ikai bhartiya rashtriya chaatr sangh (enesayuai) kii raily ko sambodhit karte hue rahul ne kaha, "ham chaahate hai ki aap raajnneeti main aaen, ise saaf-suthri banaaen or ise badalen

 mangalvaar ko congress ke chiraag rahul gandhi rajasthan main the
 The motive was to bring the genie of power back to Gehlot
 magar isi dauraan unhone garib kii sehat par jo gyaan diya or phir jis tarah se baat ko marcides par le gaye, usase yah tay ho gaya ki ye do jumale ab unki raajnneetik samaj par hone vaali charchaaon main zikr paaenge hi
 Let us first read what the Congress Vice President said
 ye kaha unhoneh ‘majdoor kii jindagi kisi hoti he
 Works two to three days
 phir do din biimaar ho jaataa he
 Then takes medicine, then works
 ’ ab aap puch sakate hai ki bhala koun sa majdoor he, jo itani jaldi-jaldi biimaar hota he
 However, Rahul's aim is not to save the health of the poor, but to save the health of the Gehlot government
 unka aage kahana yah tha ki gahalot sarkaar ne puure soobe main muft dawaai bantwai
 And the BJP is opposing it saying that it is poison
 to sachai yah he ki unhen brands vaali dawaai khaane kii aadat he
 Now to explain the difference of this brand, Rahul Gandhi explained the difference between bus and Mercedes to the rural people of Chittorgarh
 unhone kaha ki jaise koi bada aadmi hota he
 He roams in Mercedes
 he na
 Then he looks at the bus and says that look why he has boarded the bus
 congress chaahati he garib baithe hawaii jahaaj paraiske alaava rahul gandhi ne apni spich main papa rajeev gandhi ko yaad kiya or bataaya ki kaise unke laae computer or mobile se kisaanon or garibon ko sabase zyada phayda hua
 He reiterated that the BJP people were opposing it then
 phir unhone bijepi ko infrastracchar kii baat par gherte hue kaha ki bhaiya aap to sadak, railway line or airport banaakar desh badalane kii baat karte ho
 The Congress says that those who are our poor people also help them that one day they too can walk on it
 garibon se sidhe samvaad kii koshish main rahul bole ki kisaan upar udata jahaaj dekhtaa he or apane aap se poochta ki kabhi meraa betaa, uskaa pota yaa uskaa betaa, is par ja paaegaa yaa nahin
 Rahul said that 'we do not want such an India
 isliye hamane adhikaar kii baat shuru kii
 what does this mean
 jo bhi is desh main rahata he
 He will get the least help
 kam se kam bhojan or rojgaar milegaa
 We do the work of infrastructure, but we also work for the poor
 yahi gehalot ji ne rajasthan main kiya
 Ask any worker
 ’garib ke saamne diwaar, ve kehete sir se maaro thokar ismenis dauraan rahul gandhi ne ek diwaar kaa zikr kiya
 He said that 'I talk to people of other political parties in Parliament
 ve hamase kehete hai ki jab aap kisi ko muft main bhojan or dawaai dete ho, to vah bighad jaataa he
 We say that one who is trapped in poverty is not at fault, no weakness in his thinking
 uske saamne ek diwaar he
 He needs to help to remove it
 wo kehete hai ki nahin, ye jo garib ke saamne diwaar he, isko garib apane aap tode, sir se jaakar thokar maare or giraae
 We say that we will hold the hand of the poor and break the wall together
 ’ye to aapane padhe rahul gandhi ke bol, magar dhyaan rakhiegaa ki sir se takkar maari jaati he or pairon se thokar
