 inputah bhashaa Reversing the Congress over the issue of electoral bonds, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday said that a 'coalition of defeated and disgruntled corrupt leaders' does not want clean, tax-paid transparent funds to be put up in the elections
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne party mukhyalay main samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘varshon tak jin partiyon main vyakti amir hue, vyaktiyon ne bhrashtachar kaa paisa liya or raajnneeti ko bhrashtachar main lipt kar diya
 Today, when he got hurt and honest money came into politics, now he is misleading the public by making allegations
 'bataa den, congress ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki sarkaar ko sansad ke donon sadanon main chunavi bond ke mudde par vistrut charchaa karaani chahie or is puri yojana kii jaanch ke liye sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) banani chahie
 Taking a dig at the Congress, Goyal said that in some parties, the leaders became rich while the BJP only used political donations for the right purpose
 goyal ne kaha, ‘ye vahi log hai jinhone rafel par anaap-shanaap aarope lagaae, jisko janata ne bhi nakaar diya or court ne bhi unke bebuniyaad aaropon ko khaarij kar diya
 He claimed that BJP is the only party that has consistently attacked black money and encouraged honest money in the electoral system

 Rejecting media reports on the matter, he said that 'no new revelations have been revealed
 ' unhone kaha ki chunavi bond ke bare main sari suchanaaen sabake saamne uplabdh hai or koi bhi artiai ke jariye jaankaree le saktaa he
 On the corporate-related question of BJP getting more funds, he said that it is natural, because the saffron party is bigger than the Congress in terms of capacity and many organizations have also rejected the 'corrupt ideology' promoted by the opposition party
 unhone kaha ki nirvachan ayog kii sifarish par narendra modi sarkaar ne 2,000 rupee se zyada ke chande par pratibandh laga diya

 vinata ne shuru main alokanath kaa naam nahin liya, lekin baad main unhone actor kaa naam bhi liya or kai sangeen aarope lagaae
 "they abused me physically," Vinata had said

 " CP Thakur, the former president of the Bihar unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on Saturday, heated up the politics of Bihar by opposing reservation in this election season
 thakur ne shanivaar ko kaha ki desh main aarakshan kii vyavastha khatm honi chahie
 After this, the opposition parties started attacking the BJP on the issue of reservation
 patna main patrakaron se charchaa karte hue purv kendriya mantri thakur ne kaha ki desh main aarakshan 10 varsh ke liye lagu kiya gaya tha, lekin aaj aazaadee ke itane dinon baad bhi aarakshan lagu he or aarakshan kii raajnneeti chal rahi he
 In this case, the Congress in-charge of Bihar, Satyavrat Chaturvedi, accused the BJP of being anti-dalit and anti-weaker class, saying that the Congress party was in favor of reservation, and will continue to be
 unhone sawaal kiya ki centre main chah varsh ke liye bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi, tab aarakshan vyavastha kyon nahin khatm kar di gai? Here, when asked by journalists on the matter, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) President Ram Vilas Paswan, who is contesting the Lok Sabha elections in alliance with BJP, said that those making such statements do not have the right information about the reservation system
 unhone aarakshan kaa paksh lete hue kaha ki sarkari naukari or chunaavon main aarakshan alag-alag maamle hai
 The Maharashtra government has issued a mandate to cancel Muslim reservation
 sarkaar ne kaha he ki bombai hai court ke musalamaanon ko aarakshan par roak lagaae jane se is par jari adhyadesh kanoonee rup nahin le sakaa isliye muslim aarakshan sambandhi purv main jari aadesh ko radd kiya jaataa he
 Devendra Fadnavis government's decision has dealt a big blow to the previous congress-ncp government
 tatkaaleen sarkaar ne maraathon ko 16 fisad aarakshan dene ke saath muslimon ke bhi ek varg ko shiksha or naukariyon main paanch fisad aarakshan dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Significantly, a petition was filed in the Bombay High Court challenging this reservation
 yachika par sunwaayee karte hue 14 november 2014 ko court ne maratha aarakshan ke saath muslim aarakshan ko bhi sthagit kar diya tha
 But the High Court did not prohibit the reservation of Muslims in education
 sarkaar ke taaja faisle main kaha gaya he ki muslim aarakshan sambandhi adhyadesh ke kanoon main nahin badalane kii vajah se is adhyadesh kii avadhi 2 disambar 2014 ko samaapt ho gai he
 The ruling of July 24, 2014 through the mandate is quashed
 khaas baat yah he ki naukariyon or shiksha, donon main aarakshan ke liye ek hi adhyadesh jari kiya gaya tha isliye ab nae shasnadesh lagu hone ke baad muslimon ko shiksha main bhi aarakshan kaa laabh nahin mil sakegaa
 This mandate of the Fadnavis government has been criticized by the Congress
 congress ke rajyasabha sadsy hossain dalwai ne kaha he ki adaalat ne bhi mana he ki muslim samaaj shiksha main pichhadaa hua he isliye use shiksha main aarakshan milanaa chahie
 But this decision of the government has proved that this government does not want to take everyone along

 maharashtra ke rahane vaale chandresh main pichley do saalon se mumbai main rahakar koching ke saath is pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 In conversation with NDTV, Karthikeya explained the strategy of preparing for this exam
 unhone bataaya kitichar jo padhaate the use dohraane main kartikeya har rose kareeb ek se dedh ghanta lagaate the
 As far as subjects are concerned, Karthikeya used to spend only three to four hours every day reading physics
 phir do se teen ghantanumericals kii practice main unka vaqt jaataa tha
 If we compare the toppers of previous years, Karthikeya's strategy is very similar to him
 masalan, unhone bhi physics, chemistry or maths main sabase zyada vaqt physics ko diya
 Karthikeya used HC Verma's book as a basic book, broadly framing NCERT as a basic resource in chemistry and Arihant Publishing's book for maths
 agar physics ke vistaar main jaaen to kartikeya bataate hai ki maikenix main aapkaa kaaphi vaqt jaataa he
 Six months of beginning in the 11th, then you get out in it
 iske liye aapaki calculas, vector, koardinate jumetry vagairah kii samaj acchhee honi chahie
 Apart from this, you should also prepare kinematics and thermodynamics in physics
 kartikeya bataate hai ki peter saicus choti si kitaab he lihaaja aapkaa khaas vaqt bhi nahin jaataa he
 p-block, Chemical Bonding in Organic These are two special care topics
 agar maths kii baat karen to arihant prakaashan kii kitaab ke alaava esel loni kii kitaab se unhone padhai kii
 Karthikeya says that if you get stuck in solving problems many times, don't give up in such a hurry
 isse phayda ye hoga ki agar aapane thodaa zyada vaqt laga kar us sawaal ko solve kar liya to aapako na sirf wo process yaad ho jaayegaa balki aapkaa confidence bhi badhegaa

 On hearing the name of the poet, hang the bag and the image of a helpless and poor man with a beard wearing kurta-pajama comes out, but these things do not apply to 42-year-old young poet Kumar Vishwas
 koi divaana kahata he koi pagal samajhataa he
 
 
 Kumar Vishwas, who has made a place in the hearts of the youth with poetry, is currently the most expensive poet in the country
 hindi, english yaa kisi bhi bhashaa kaa kavi teen ghante ke kavi sammelan ke 4 lakh ru
 Can't even think of asking
 ve kavi sammelnon main apni khud kii toyota inova car se jate hai
 By the way, they also have Tata Aria

 In 2010, when the foundation of Anna Hazare's movement was being laid, Kumar was remembered for connecting the youth with this movement
 or hua yah ki andolan ke saath kumaar vishwaas kaa kad bhi badhata gaya
 By 2010 he was to attend a poet's conference where Rs 40,000- 50,000
 liya karte the, anna andolan ke baad to unke bhav aasmaan par ja pahunche
 His popularity can be gauged from this that about 25 thousand people have liked his post on Facebook last week, announcing that he had quit his job
 yahi nahin, kareeb 2,670 logon ne unki is post par tippanee kii
 They are liked by more than two lakh people on Facebook and this number is continuously increasing

 After joining the movement, more people started recognizing me

 Kumar, the fifth child of the Sharma family, a minor in Pilkhuwa town in Ghaziabad, decided to leave engineering studies unsuccessful when his father, a professor in a degree college, was deeply disappointed
 kavitaaon ke peeche bhaagane vaale kumaar ne bie karne kii ichha jaahir kii to naaraaz pita ne isaki fees khud jutaney kaa farmaan suna diya
 It was around 1988

 Kumar also recited poetry there, which was well liked

 They started calling for poems

 The name started happening, but something was knocking them

 He decided how to awaken the love of poetry among the youth
 collejon main jaakar kavi sammelan karnaa shuru kar diya unhone pehla aayojan 2002 main enity dilli main kiya
 It is here that he calls his poem Koi Deewana
 
 
 sunai or saath main jab yah jumala joda ki is baar ke semester main yah kavita aane vaali he to haul taaliyon se gunj uthaa
 Talking to the youth in his language, wearing the same clothes as him, speaking like him, joking, these characteristics of Kumar made him popular among the youth

 ve hindi ke shaayad pehle kavi hai, jinhone apana bijness manager (vishaal) or brands manager (ruchi) rakhaa hua he
 He claims that he is the first poet in the country whose admirers can take the caller ring bank tone of his poems from their service provider
 unke prashansakon main filmkaar anuraag kashyap, cricketer suresh raina or abhinayta shekhar suman bhi shaamil hai
 Kashyapa has asked for the rights of her poem was a mad girl
 film nirmaataa sunil bohara ne apane fasebuk pej par likhaa he ki ''koi bhi kumaar vishwaas kaa mujhase bada fain hua to main use goli maar duungaa
 According to Kumar's claim, he is the only poet to be called for a corporate show

 His show in New Jersey this year was Housefull
 jise dekhne se vanchit rah gaye prashansakon kii maang par aayojakon ko usee hafte ek or sho karnaa padaa
 But along with the number of his fans, his 'enemies' also started growing
 2004 se 2009 kaa unka samay khaasaa sangharsh bharaa rahaa
 "the established poets did not like my popularity
 isi bich 15-20 kaviyon ne milakar tay kiya ki jahaan mujhe bulaayaa jayega, vahaan ve nahin jaaenge
 Even today i am not called in government conferences
 '' lekin anna andolan ne unhen nidar banaaya or bebaak bhi
 That is why he is able to compare Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi with a skilled administrator and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with a child with a brain

 During the Anna movement, he was accused of making provocative statements from the stage

 The Facebook page of India Against Corruption had to remove his poem
 sahibabad ke lala lajpat raay college main hindi ke is associat profvsar kii patni manju sharma rajasthan ke bharatpur main professor hai
 Despite being on 'legal leave' from the college for the agitation, he was accused of not coming to college
 ''mere hastakshar kaat die gaye
 i replied to 11-11 show cause notices in one day
 '' haal ke dinon main unhen lag rahaa tha ki naukari chhod deni chahie
 He has resigned the college which is not yet approved
 philhal ve chuttee par hi rahenge
 The Anna movement made Kumar a celebrity from an ordinary poet
 2005 tak 20,000 ru
 10 to 12 lakhs this year to pay a nominal income tax of Rs
 tex bharne ja rahe hai
 Apparently, both the Anna movement and Kumar Vishwas have benefited from each other

 The post cites an example that the US dropped atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan in 1945, so Japan refused to import needle from the US, showing patriotism
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki ye donon hi daawey galat hai
 Japan was the fourth largest export market for the US in 2018
 iske alaava, bharat china se saamaan aayaat karne vaale deshon kii suchi main saatven number par rahaa, america is suchi main number ek par he
 This misleading and false claim was posted on Facebook page 'dekh Bhai' on 25 August

 This post has been viral on social media since 2017 and has been shared by many users
 AFWA kii padtalunited stats trade riprogentative kiwebsitekhangaalane par AFWA ne paaya ki america ne 2018 main japan ko 120
 Exported 4 billion dollars, including various goods and services
 jabaki isi saal america ne japan se 177
 Also imported 1 billion dollars
 agar ham 2019 kii baat karen to united stats sensos beuro kibebsitakahati he ki june, 2019 tak america japan ko takreeban 37 billian dollar kaa niryaat kar chukaa he
 The post also claimed that India is the largest importing country from China
 lekin Statista kireportkahati he ki america china se aayaat karne waalon kii suchi main number ek par he
 It accounts for 19 of China's total exports
 2 fisadi aayaat karata he, jabaki china ke kul niryaat main bharat kaa hissaa maatr 3
 1 percent
 is tarah bharat china se aayaat karne waalon kii suchi main saatven number par he
 Therefore, the claim that Japan has stopped importing from the US is completely wrong and India is at number one in terms of import from China

 It is possible that after a few days, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves from his house to go to Safdarjung Airport, then go through a special tunnel
 ji haa, 7 res course road sthit pradhanmantri awaas se lekar safadarajang airport tak ek khaas surang banaai ja rahi he

 lekin ab bataaya ja rahaa he ki do maheene ke bheetar yah khaas surang banakar taiyaar ho jaaegi
 CPWD has chosen DMRC to complete the tunnel work
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki surang banane ke liye neeche kaa kaam ho gaya he, upar kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Traveling by road from PM residence to Safdarjung Airport takes three kilometers
 agar piem kaa kafila is root se jaataa he to 10 se 15 minute kaa samay lagata he or jam lagane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Why this tunnel is important? The purpose of this tunnel is to protect the PM as well as to protect them from congestion during VIP movement
 is surang kaa ek phayda yah bhi he ki viviipi movement ke samay is root par trephic diavarjan bhi nahin karnaa padegaa
 During the Emergency, this tunnel will be very effective for removing Narendra Modi from the pm's residence
 yani agar piem awaas par hamalaa ho jaataa he yaa koi prakritik aapadaa aa jaati he to narendra modi ko surakshit airport pahunchane ke liye yah surang mufeed hogi
 7, RCR to Safdarjung Airport can be reached in just two-three minutes after the tunnel is built

 -input bhashaa se Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that he will not "pressurize" Japan over the civil nuclear deal, as he understands the sensitivity of the nuclear issue
 do din kii yatra par japan aae manmohan singh ne haalanki kaha ki vah chahenge ki japani companiyaan bharat ke parmaanu udyog vistaar main bhagidaari karen
 "we would hope that Japan will be India's partner in the expansion of the Indian nuclear industry for peaceful purposes," he said during an afternoon banquet here
 lekin main japan main mudde kii samvedansheeltaa ko mahasoos karata hum or isliye dabaav nahin daaloongaa
 Manmohan made these comments in response to a question
 unase donon deshon ke bich samgr aarthik bhagidaari samjhauta (siipie) puraa hone ke baad agle kadamon ke bare main poocha gaya
 The Prime Minister's comments come at a time when Japan has been insisting that the proposed agreement on the civil nuclear agreement should provide that cooperation will end if India conducts a nuclear test
 donon desh prastaavti samjhaute par do daur kii baat kar chuke hai or bhartiya paksh sanket de chukaa he ki dastavej main uski sthiti uchit shabdon ke jariye anukool rup se darshaayi ja sakati he
 Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack and is highly sensitive to the issue, especially expressing concern that India has not signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT)
 yah ullekh karte hue ki bharat kii teji se badhati aarthik vruddhi ke chalate urja kii maang bad rahi he manmohan ne vyavsaayik hastiyon se kaha ki is kshetra main donon deshon ke bich sahyog se ‘‘japani companiyaan bharat ke mahatvakankshi parmaanu kaarykram main bhagidaari karne main sakasham hongi
 The Prime Minister said that being a global leader in energy efficient technology, Japan can play an important role in helping India so that its energy needs can be met in an environmentally friendly manner
 yahaan nippon kidanaren dwaara yojit vyavsaayik dopaher bhoj main manmohan ne kaha ‘‘ham paaramparik or yahaan tak ki naveen evam akshay urja kshetra main japan kii praudyogiki tathaa nivesh chaahate hai
 India is already eight countries after the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) granted India an exemption for peaceful nuclear trade in 2008
 
 The United States has signed nuclear agreements with France, Russia, Canada, Kazakhstan, Argentina, Namibia and Mongolia

 However, Rajbhar rejects these allegations outright

 *** On Wednesday, when PM Modi arrived for special puja at Somnath temple in Gujarat, the presence of Keshubhai Patel with Amit Shah gave rise to political speculation again
 atakalein lagani shuru ho gayi ki kya hardik patel factor kii kaat ke liye bijepi phir se keshubhai patel ko aage karne kii taiyaari main he
 But is it so easy? jaane kya mushkilen hai patidaar andolan kii or bijepi ke liye kyon nahin he raah aasaan-1
 How close will Keshubhai be to Team Modi? Keshubhai Patel was once far above Modi in the politics of Gujarat and Modi came to his throne only later
 tabase modi or keshubhai patel ke rishton kii talkhi kisi se chuphi nahin rahi
 But suddenly Keshubhai was seen with Patel, then it was said that BJP is trying to bring other Patidar leader Keshubhai Patel to deal with the challenge faced by Hardik Patel
 2
 How much of Hardik's penetration among the Patels? Hardik Patel is in the role of agitator with the Patidar community leader, who was once considered a leader of the Patidar community and is demanding a reservation for him and has a direct fight with Team Modi
 hardik patel rajya main kai badi reliyaan kar chuke hai or abtak bijepi sarkaar ke liye iskaa saamana karnaa aasaan nahin rahaa
 3
 shivasena se hardik ke judane kaa kya hoga asar?hardik patel ab gujarat main shivasena ke phase hai or aise main bijepi ko apane liye phir se sambhaavnaaen dikh rahi hai
 Bringing Keshubhai Patel back raises the bjp's prospects
 haalanki, hardik or shivasena ke ek hone kaa nuksaan bhi bijepi ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The Shiv Sena is considered a staunch Hinduist and if Hardik Patel gets a little benefit from it, then BJP will be directly affected
 4
 How BJP will overcome the Rupani Factor? After removing Anandi Ben Patel to make non-patel leader Vijay Rupani the CM, it is important for the BJP to put forward a Patel leader so that Hardik Patel does not get a chance to make inroads into the Patidar community
 aise main keshubhai patel ke liye phir se bijepi main jagah bananaa aasaan hoga
 However, after victory in the Lok Sabha elections, Modi had come to meet Keshubhai Patel and now the two leaders were seen together in the Somnath temple
 iske siyaasi myne khoje ja rahe hai
 What is the background of the Patel movement in Gujarat? The Bakshi Commission identified socially and educationally backward communities in Gujarat and made reservations for the Other Backward Classes in the 1970s
 isamen patidaar shaamil nahin the, jinka saamaajik dabadabaa pehle bhi tha or ab bhi he
 After including the Kshatriya community in the reservation list, the Patels started the reservation movement
 tab gujarat main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) multah patelon kii party maani jaati thi
 The Congress also has a good share in the state in terms of vote share (30 per cent in the north) and it is considered to be basically a party of Kshatriyas in the state
 The anger of the Patidars was more that their place was given to the lower castes
 
 pichley do saal se hardik patel patidaaron ke netaa ke rup main ubhare hai or modi ke khilaaf kai rajyon ke kshetreey netaaon kaa unhen samarthan hasil hua he
 This can become a problem for the BJP, for which the BJP needs an effective Patidar leader to cut it

 Referring to his previous letter to Manmohan, denouncing the proposal of the Indian Navy chief to enroll Sri Lankan naval personnel in the four-year Bachelor of Technology course to be given to Indian naval officers, the Chief Minister said, "I see this in media reports i am completely disappointed that the Indian Coast Guard is taking part in a Marine Defense exercise and It has deployed its ships, officers and people to Trincomalee to take part in the exercise, which will reportedly commence on 21 December 2013

 In the case of worshiping at Durgabhavan, Deobandi Ulema says that if Nusrat Jahan has to do non-religious work, she can change her name
 ravivaar ko durgashtami ke avasar par nusrat jahaan maathe par bindi, maang main sindur lagaakar apane pati nikhil jain ke saath kolkata ke pandal main pahunchin thim
 During this, there was a lot of shrieking on the drum
 is par devbandi ulema kaa bayaan saamne aayaa he or unhone naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 View this post on Instagram That why Nusrat is where non-religious people are working? He said that in Islam it is forbidden to pray to anyone other than Allah
 agar nusrat jahaan ko gaiyr-majahabi kaam karne hai to kyon naa nusrat jahaan apana naam badal len, is tarah ke amal karne se islam va musalamaanon kii kyon tauheen kar rahi hai
 Deobandi Ulema said that this practice of Nusrat Jahan has not been revealed for the first time, she has been worshiping even before this
 isi amal ko doharaate hue unhone is baar bhi navadurga kii puja kii he to main samajhataa hum ki is tarah kaa amal islam ke andar bilkul jaij nahin he

 It is a matter of concern that such incidents are continuously increasing
 sirf maheene bhar ke andar dilli, gurugram or gajiabad main chaar parivaar ke 17 logon ko unke apano ne hi maut ke ghat utaar diya
 In Ghaziabad, a man killed his wife and then committed suicide
 gurugram main kuch din pehle ek chemical ejeeniyar ne bivi or bacchon kii katl karne ke baad khudakushi kar lee thi
 At Mehrauli, a government school teacher brutally murdered his wife and children
 jaraa sochie ki in sab ghatnaon main ek baat kaaman he ki parivaar ke mukhiya ne hi in vaardaat ko anjaam diya or maasoom bacchon kaa katl kar diya
 Someone strangled wife's children and someone strangled them
 or kisi ne apni maasoom betiyon ke munh or naak par tepe baandh kar apane hi ashiquane ko shmashaan bana diya
 Does the gardener cash in? depressant or manmutav dur karne kaa bas yahi ek rasta bachaa he?gajiabad ke musuri main pradeep apane parivaar ke saath rahata tha
 But 3 days ago, there were four dead bodies lying on the bed in his room
 pradeep ke alaava uski teen, paanch or aath saal kii teen betiyon kii laashen
 The arms and legs of the three girls were open
 bas aankh se lekar munh tak chaar inch kii kaali tepe chipki thi
 The tape was wrapped in such a way that they could not breathe through the nose or mouth
 khud pradeep ne bhi apane munh or naak ko usee kaali tepe se lapet rakhaa tha
 But the question is whether a person with both hands open can only commit suicide by wrapping tape on the mouth and nose? a similar heartbreaking incident occurred in Gurugram

 is babat unhone media ko tepe jari bhi kiya, is tepe main ek shaks peedit ladki ke pita ke dost ko ye samajhane ke liye kah rahaa he ki wo donon apane bayaan badale len or ye silsilaa pichley kai dinon se jari he
 The victim's lawyer says that if his client does not change his statement, he and his family will have to face serious consequences
 peedit ladki ke vakil kaa kahana he ki in dhamkiyon ke baad se puraa parivaar kaaphi ghabaraaya hua he
 According to the victim's lawyer, this voice is from Asaram's old serviceman Shyam and he has also threatened the victim's father over phone that the central government is a few months old
 6 maheene baad wo badal jaaegi
 Think of your family and take the matter back
 peedit ke vakil ke mutabik naaballig ladki ke pita jald hi police main is bare main ek shikaayat darj karavaaenge
 How much truth is there in this audio recording will be known only after the police investigation, but it is also true that earlier the DCP of Jodhpur, who is investigating this case, has also been threatened with death
 satsang ke dauraan hota tha ladakiyon kaa chunaavakoi sant apane satsang main ladakiyon par nigaah rakhe or phir mauka milte hi unhen uthaa kar sidhe apane haram main bitha le, ye sun kar bhi ajeeb lagata he, lekin asaram ke bare main unke puraane vaidya or raajadaar ne jo nayaa khulaasa kiya he, wo kuch aisa hi he
 According to this person, Asaram used to pick girls during satsang with the help of his seekers and that too in a very unique way
 asaram ke puraane sevadaar or peshey se vaidya amrit prajapati kii maane to unhone khud apni ankhon se asaram kaa wo sach dekha, jise dekhne ke baad pehali baar khud unke liye apni ankhon par yakeen karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 Because Asaram had been sexually exploiting the girls and women who had come in his satsang for years by wearing the saint's costume for a few days, and all this was done in such a vicious manner that Asaram himself would be seen as the seeker-like operatives living near him
 Apart from this, there is no news of this game to anyone
 lager lite se asaram karata he isharaprajapati kii maane to asaram sirf ishaaron hi ishaaron main apane gurgon ko satsang main pahunchi un ladakiyon ke bare main bataaya karata tha, jo use pasand aa jaati thi
 And for this, while going from his hut to the pavilion of the satsang, Asaram shined many times with a small laser light in his hand
 asaram ko agar apni swaagat main khadi ladakiyon main se koi ladki pasand aa jaati, to wo baatcheet ke bahaane us ladki par ek-ek kar lager lite se teen baar raushnee chamkaaya karata or bas, iske baad asaram jaise hi aage badhata, uske shaatir sadhak us ladki ko asaram ke haram tak pahunchane ke liye jugat lagaana shuru kar dete
 The girl is now tried to brainwash through things like surrender and sacrifice to the guru, and as soon as the girl becomes a little weak, she is taken straight to the guru's meditation hall, that is, Asaram's harem
 asaram ko shilpi par sabase zyada bharosaprajapati kii maane to asaram kii karatuuton kaa bhanda footne par police beshak asaram ke saath-saath uski ek shishyaa shilpi par apana shikanja kas rahi ho, lekin aaj se koi das das pehle hi asaram ke paas shilpi sareekhee 25 se zyada sadhak yaa phir yun kahen ki gurgey hua karte the, jo asaram ke liye ladakiyon kaa intjaam karte the
 But even then, Shilpi was more vicious than all her operatives and most trusted of Asaram
 kyonki aksar shilpi ko asaram kii pansad samajhane ke liye lager lite kii jarurat bhi nahin padati, balki wo sirf uske haav-bhav or harkaton se hi ye bhaanp leti thi ki asaram kis ladki ke saath apni nazdikiyaan badhanaa chahta he
 Amid reports of tension in the relationship, senior BJP leader LK Advani started his election campaign on Monday seeking votes for Narendra Modi
 shegaanv se maujuuda bhaajapa saansad dinesh gandhi ke samarthan main apni pehali chunaav prachaar raily ko sambodhit karte hue adwani ne kaha, 'modi ko vot den, badlaav ke liye vot den
 'he said,' The country needs and hopes to work, not just slogans
 isliye badlaav ke liye vot den, modi ko vot den
 ' media main aisi atakalein lagati rahi hai ki donon netaaon ke bich sab kuch thik nahin he
 Recently, after Advani expressed his desire to contest from Bhopal, the party leadership had to come in the middle for the honor
 lekin, adwani par gandhinagar nirvachan kshetra ko hi chunane kaa dabaav daalaa gaya
 Advani has been representing the Gandhinagar seat since 1991, but his desire to contest elections from Bhopal was seen as tensions were growing between him and Modi
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhaajapa ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii tarif karte hue adwani ne kaha ki unhone narmada pariyojna ke jariye gujarat kii tasviir badal di

 Vishwas has also told his supporters through Twitter that the Rajya Sabha seat does not matter to him, first the country and then the party
 aam aadmi party ke ek sutara ne bataaya ki yah nishchit he ki aam aadmi party kii ore se kumaar vishwaas rajyasabha nahin jaaenge
 If sources are to be believed, Vishwas has spoken out of the party's stand in the past, which the party is not happy with
 saaf he ki rajyasabha ke liye 5 janvari tak namakan karne kii aakhri taarikh he
 So far, many other people had offered Rajya Sabha seat from Kejriwal
 party kisi majboot chehre ko rajyasabha main bhejnaa chaahati he, lekin abhi tak jise bhi party kii taraf se approach kiya gaya he, usne manaa hi kiya he
 So far, if many veterans are considered as aproachsutras, the Aam Aadmi Party has so far been offered Rajya Sabha seat to big legends like former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie
 ye teenon hi modi sarkaar ke dhuravirohi rahe hai
 Apart from these, the party has approached former Supreme Court judge TS Thakur, Infosys chief Narayana Murthy, Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi and businessman Sunil Munjal
 haalanki, abhi tak in sabhi kii ore se koi bada kaaran saamne nahin aayaa he jiske kaaran unhone is peshkash ko thukraayaa ho
 But it can be said that they are not happy with the policies of the Aam Aadmi Party

 How to move on after a serious heartbreak? (one of the top three questions by my clients
 ) i took many years to move on after my 1st broken relationship
 After many wrong decisions, much hatred and ill health later, i finally allowed mindfulness into my life
 It took me 7 years for closure and 15 years to finally love a Man truly
 (you don't have to have a snail speed like i did!) So how did i attract the perfect man i envisioned? How did i move on after heartbreak? 1
 i stopped talking about my ex partner completely
 2
 i allowed a complete cleansing process
 No casual or serious dating
 3
 i finally started to 'bless my ex partner'
