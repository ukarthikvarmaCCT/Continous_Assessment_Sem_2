 a Congress member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) set up to investigate the Land Acquisition Bill sent a text message to Rahul Gandhi on the afternoon of 25 July
 yah unhen ek ittila dene ke liye tha, jo unhen jepisi ke ek saathi sadsy or varisht bijepi netaa se mili thiah sarkaar bhoomi vidheyak main kisaanon kii manjuuri or saamaajik prabhaav ke akalan vaali dhaaraon ko waapas laaegi, donon dharaaen jo manmohan singh sarkaar ke 2013 ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii mul aatma thim
 The Congress vice-president decided to move forward and told his JPC member that the party should ensure that the land bill does not come in any form in the monsoon session of Parliament
 is ranneeti ko mukammal shakl dene ke baad rahul ne yuva congress ke adhyaksh amarinder singh raja se baat kii
 Raja had planned a dharna outside Sushma Swaraj's house on July 27 in connection with the alleged help of Foreign Minister Lalit Modi and sought Rahul's opinion on it
 yojana kuch is tarah tay huiah rahul sansad main 'hangaame' kii aguai karenge, raja kii bhoomika sadak par tamaashe ko anjaam dene kii hogi
 Regarding the strategy of 'bhaiyya', Rahul says, the President of Youth Congress, "he always said only one thing: Get on the road, raise your voice and make public engagement with them on every issue
" ''16veen loksabhaa main yah rahul kii pehali or ab tak kii sabase badi fatah thi
 With just 43 colleagues in the Lok Sabha, he forced the government to back down on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's most lavish legislation, despite the nda's overwhelming majority in the lower house
 may, 2014 ke baad se rahul kii pehali manovaigyanik fatah kii ittila dene vaale us text massej ne or uske baad unki party ke koi na koi mudda uthaane or use kamyaabi ke mukaam tak pahunchane main rahul kii tarakkee ne aakhirkaar rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ke agle daur tak ke liye congress kaa mizaaj or lahaza tay kar diya—khub bolo, aam logon ke saath samvaad kaayam karo or apni takat se zyada jor se waar karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 Despite the victory, calling it the second incarnation of Rahul Gandhi, his supporters pass away
 loksabhaa main congress ke mukhya sachetak jyotiraditya sindhiya hakeekat bayaan karne vaale andaaj main kehete hai, ''yah (bhoomi adhigrahan) vidheyak unheen kii dein he
 He took to the streets in 2013 to bring this bill and now he did the same to save it again
 ''haalanki bhoomi vidheyak ko lekar rahul ke is junun kii vajah se yah dharna bhi bani he ki ve udyogon ke khilaaf hai—dhan kii tangi jhel rahi party ko is dharna se or bhi thes lag sakati he
 This tightness is to the extent that in July eighty-five treasurers of the Congress Motilal Vora had to issue a letter that all the member party had to pay Rs 250
 chanda den
 Apart from this, except for the general secretaries of the party, the air travel of other leaders has been stopped
 congress ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''rahul kii sabase badi kamajori yah he ki unke paas ahamed patel sareekha koi shaks nahin he jo korporate gharaanon ke saath sampark kar sake
 "perhaps this is the reason that these days the discussion in the party is in full swing that Patel can soon replace Vora
" nai-naveli shailiabhi is baat kaa faisla hona he ki rahul kaa yah atisakriy virdohi tevar kitna kargar he or kya congress ko phir se jilane kaa yahi sabase acha tarika he
 There is an opinion that many important changes in the way they work have brought life to the workers
 ek to rahul kaa nijee cell phone number ab sabhi mahasachivon or rajya party adhyakshon ko de diya gaya he
 Defying their earlier courts, they can now speak directly to them
 ravivaar sahit saaton din subah 8
 Working in a tiring manner from 30 am to 2 pm, these days, he sends direct instructions over the phone on which strategy to follow
 party ke jo varisht netaa pehle shikaayat karte the ki rahul ke daftar ne unhen pahunch se baahar kar diya he, ab khush hai
 a colleague of his office says, "earlier, if a Congress leader asked for an appointment with him and i used to say that he was very busy for the next one week, he would get angry
" ab ve khud yahi baat kehete hai, magar vah netaa khush ho jaataa he kyonki yah baat sidhe unhone kahi he
 "even the veteran leaders of the party seem happy
 purv kendriya mantri or loksabhaa saansad kamalnath kehete hai, ''unase milanaa aasaan he or kisi bhi din ve congress adhyaksh kii banisbat zyada logon se milte hai
 "another important change is that Rahul is no longer dependent on one permanent political team
 isaki bajaae ve alag-alag muddon par visheshgyata ke aadhaar par alag-alag netaaon se baat karte hai
 For example, when the issue of land acquisition became bigger, Jairam Ramesh was brought out of his resting place
 pehali baar loksabhaa main chunakar aae saansad kehete hai, ''jaankaron kii baat ve sunate jarur hai, lekin aakhri faisla congress upaadhyaksh khud lete hai; uske baad ve daaen-baayen nahin karte
 Some prominent leaders, for instance, questioned the strategy of stalling Parliament to demand the resignations of Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 rahul ne unako dhairya se suna lekin apane faisle par tike rahe
 "close associates say that the most important change has been that even when things are not going well around them, they do nothing to challenge the opponents
 haal hi main jaipur main ve party kaaryakartaaon ke bich takreer kar rahe the, tab gram panchayat ke ek sadsy ne unhen kai baar tokaa or party ke kaamkaaj par apni hataasha jaahir kii
 Rahul turned his answer into an attack on the BJP, which he said (by the panchayat member) was what he had to say and now he has found peace
 lekin yah baat vah isliye kah sake kyonki ve congress main hai
 Can anyone voice opposition in BJP? Can anyone dare to speak in front of Modi? ”he is trying to pass on the art of instant speech to Rahul San — a lesson he learned in the hands of Modi in the Lok Sabha elections and Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi assembly elections
 Is achieved by the defeat of
 party ke andruni sutara kehete hai ki ve ek aisa sancha taiyaar karne kii koshish kar rahe hai jo do netaaon kii shaileyon ko milakar gadha gaya he
 "they follow Kejriwal's model in terms of choosing issues, because politics like Aam Aadmi Party's TV serial snapped up traditional Congress voters in Delhi," says a top leader
 vahiin modi se unhone siyasat main tamaashe kii ahmiyat sikhi
 The edge and tongue of his attacks have become more comfortable and grounded
 ''unke ek bharosemand saathi kubul karte hai ki rahul pradhanmantri ke chunaav se pehle ke bhaashanon kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kar rahe hai—bataate hai ki july 2013 main pune ke fagryusan college main modi ke bhaashan ko sunne ke baad unhone apane daftar ke ek sahyogi se kaha, ''unhone koi vijan saamne nahin rakhaa lekin jis dhang se ve bole, chaatro ko bada acha laga
 It is very important to say what people want to hear
 '' shaayad yahi vajah he ki 31 july ko apatiai, pune ke chaatro ke saath baithak main unhone vakpatutaa kaa sahaara liya, ''is par vaaki acchhee film banegi—bharat sarkaar kii puri takat 250 chaatro ko darkinar karne kii koshish main he
 Another way Rahul is trying is to create new core groups for the party
 june main unhone vetan or duusare phaaydon kii maang ke liye virodh pradarshan kar rahe dilli ke safaikarmiyon se mulaakaat kii
 Rahul was so impressed with Raja Rani, a woman involved in the performance, that he made the head of the party's scheduled caste cell
 raju se us mahila se sampark karne ke liye kaha
 The 40-year-old woman could not join immediately due to being a government employee, but after some time the party is trying to figure out how to involve them
 apni kerala yatra ke dauraan rahul ek machuaare pratapan se mili or uske baad unhen party main shaamil kar liya gaya
 Problems The same advocates of Puranirahul say that bringing this type of new people will make the party bigger, while many leaders of the states feel that strengthening the local structure of the organization is more important
 uttar pradesh ke ek sheersh netaa kehete hai, ''ve dur-dur ke daure kar rahe hai, safai karmchaariyon or haat-bazaar ke dukandaaron ko khoj rahe hai, lekin ve apane grih rajya uttar pradesh main kuch vakt kyon nahin gujaarte? dilli kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar jaataa he or isi rajya main ham sifer hai
 Former Union Minister Jitin Prasad Milda, who lost the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Dhaurahra seat in the state, defended that the party is working on a strategy for UP
 rahul kii badi aajamaaish un rajyon main hogi jahaan agle do saal main chunaav hone vaale hai
 Leave aside the fact that in most of these states, the expectation of the Congress performing well is not visible at least for now
 bihar main is saal hone vaale chunaavon se thik pehle party nitish kumaar-lalu prasad yadav ke gathbandhan main tisare darje kii bhoomika adaa kar rahi he
 Next year, the party will go to the polls seeking votes to come back to power in two states
 inamen se ek, party ke liye sabase mahfuj rajya maane jane vaale assam main mukhyamantri tarun gogoi or hemanth biswa sarama ke bich ladaai is kadar badtar hoti ja rahi he ki yah rajya bhi party ke haathon se jaataa dikhaai de rahaa he
 In Kerala, Chief Minister Uman Chandy and Pradesh Congress chief V
 em
 The widening gap between Sudheeran as well as the trend of anti-incumbency votes can dislodge the party from the throne of the state
 tamilnadu or pashchim bengal main bhi 2016 main chunaav hone hai or in donon hi rajyon main party haashie ke khilaadi kii bhoomika main simat gai he
 In Punjab, Rahul has failed to resolve the ongoing crisis between former Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and state Congress chief Pratap Singh Bajwa and as a result the party may again miss the 2017 elections
 ek varisht netaa kii baat par bharosa karen to amritsar se loksabhaa saansad amarinder singh ne ek nai party kaa naam pehle hi register karvaa liya he or congress chhodie ke liye ve bas sahi samay kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Such leaders do not even have a list at the moment, but Jyotiraditya Scindia is confident that Rahul will put the party afresh and win the election
 guna se saansad sindhiya kehete hai, hindustan ke bahut kam netaaon ko harek rajya kii itani gahari aitihaasik or saamaajik jaankaree he jitani rahul gandhi ko he
 "during a recent padyatra, Rahul apparently began to experience guilt while eating biryani for lunch
 bataate hai ki unhone apane ek sahyogi se kaha ki ve na sirf sehat bigaadpee vaala khaanaa kha rahe hai, balki gym bhi nahin ja paa rahe hai—vah bhi kabhi-kabhi to kai din tak
 Many state Congress leaders may feel that as much as Rahul cares about his aligned muscles, he should be equally concerned about improving the health of the party in various states
 beshak bhavishya main party ko isiu se baahar nikaalane kaa yahi ekmaatr tarika bhi he
 Have you ever loved anyone? Ever given someone a heart? But still the love remained unilaterally
 kuch hote hai aise bhi jo kamitment ke is khel main utarane se kataraate hai
 Staying single has become a symbol of freedom
 lekin single rahane kii is daud main zyaadaatar ladke hi najar aate hai
 During the dating, the girls show commitments more quickly, but the boys are caught in the confusion
 kamitment se dur bhaagate ladakon ko pahchaanane main ladakiyon ko koi khaas mashkkat nahin kerani hoti
 By looking at some specific things, you can guess that the boy does not want to commit, like: 1
 wo ofishili aapako apni garlfriend banane se kataraata he
 2
 wo baar baar yahi zikr karata he ki uskaa kaam uske liye jaruri he or use apane kariyar par focus karnaa he
 3
 wo apane doston or family se aapako nahin milwataa he
 4
 wo pehle se kisi cheez kii planning nahin karke rakhata he, balki aakhri samay main saare plance banaata he
 5
 dating ke liye weekends par sabase zyada samay miltaa he, lekin wo weekends par hi aapke saath nahin hota
 6
 wo imotional nahin he
 7
 wo or bhi kai ladakiyon se dosti or baatcheet rakhata he
 It is probably most painful for a girl that the boy she is investing her time in and her emotions is not serious about the relationship
 aise main ladki ko pataa hi nahin hota ki aakhirkaar wo us ladke kii life main kahaan stand karti he
 The only confusion in the mind is that he likes but wanders away from love and his expression
 jaruri nahin ki aisa hameshaa hi dekhne ko mili
 Many times a boy is entangled in his work pressure, or is deceived by his ex-girlfriend
 aise cese main bhi wo kamitment se kataraata he
 So in this way, search the boy's mind
 shaayad wo physical relationships se bhi kuch zyada expect karata ho
 Follow the tricks of emotional bonding with him
 offis ke time se lekar khaane pine tak apni phikr jataaie
 When you have thrown your time, your energy and your emotions into a boy, then it is not right to retreat
 apni pasand ke ladke kii jaruraton ko samajhie
 And if there is a question of commitment, then you take the initiative

 ' Aam Aadmi Party leaders are coming forward to give clarification one after the other after receiving notice on the mess of income tax

 Manish Sisodia alleges that all donations from the Aam Aadmi Party are coming through the bank and despite the transparent manner, the donations are being called illegal
 sisodiya ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki inakam tex vibhaag ko 34 baar jawaab nahin dene kaa aarope bhi galat he
 Interacting with the media, Manish Sisodia showed a bundle of accounts in which the information of the donors of Aam Aadmi Party is present
 sisodiya ne kaagaj kii potliyaan dikhaate hue kaha ki yah aam aadmi party kaa acount he, isamen 1 lakh se zyada entry he
 Anant Singh gave a donation of 500 rupees from Shahdol, has written all his details
 ashok prasad ne gudgaanv se 123 baar chanda diya, inaki bank detail, pataa sab kuch likhaa hua he
 Sisodia claimed that the common man also prepares reports of donations received by the party
 manish sisodiya kaa kahana he, "bharat ke itihaas main aam aadmi party hi ek aisi party he jo apane chande ke ek-ek rupee kaa puraa hisaab naa keval vyavasthit karti he balki use chunaav ayog samet jaanch agenciyon ko saunpti he
 If someone gives a donation of 10 rupees to the party, then his entire book and account remains with the party, in spite of this, all the donations of the Aam Aadmi Party have been taxed as illegal
 inakam tex vibhaag kii yah karrwai centre main baithi bhartiya janata party ke ishaare par hui he
 "although the notice of income tax was sent to the Ramlila Maidan a few days before the foundation day program, but the Aam Aadmi Party is also alleging that as recently as the Chief Minister of Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal made this appeal That the people of Gujarat should not vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party and we all aim to defeat the BJP, after that the income tax notice is passed t was sent

 Meanwhile, supporters gathered in large numbers at Jantar Mantar on Saturday evening
 hajaare ne jahaan ravivaar se aamaran anshan par baithne kii baat kahi, vahiin arvind kejariwal ne anna se apil kii ki unke praan desh ke liye jaruri he or sehat ko dekhte hue unhen anshan par nahin baithna chahie
 He said that soon after independence, the country lost Gandhi, after the entire revolution movement, the country soon lost Jayaprakash Narayan and now the country will not be able to bear that Anna's health also deteriorate
 dopaher main hajaare ne ravivaar se aamaran anshan par jane kii chetavanee dete hue kaha ki ve raajnneetik party kaa gathan to nahin karenge lekin achche ummidavaaron ko khadaa kar janata ko vikalp denge
 Taking a dig at the Congress and the BJP, he said that the country is not safe in these two hands
 udhar bhaajapa ne team anna ko paroksh chetavanee dete hue kaha ki loktantr main sabhi ko apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar he, lekin aisa karte samay seemaa ko paar nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that people often ask why he does not form a political party and does not send his candidates to Parliament
 is par unhone kaha ki ek to chunaav main karodon rupe kharch hote hai or unke paas itane paise nahin hai ki vah chunaav lard saken, lekin is anshan ke khatm hone ke baad vah puure desh kaa daura karenge or aise charitravaan logon kii khoj karenge jo chunaav lard saken
 Contrary to Hazare and Ramdev's stance of not targeting Pranab Mukherjee after becoming President, Kejriwal targeted Mukherjee, saying that his presidency has corrupted the dignity of the chair as he is accused of corruption
 unhone kaha ki vah is baat se sahamat nahin ki raashtrapati ban jane se mukherjee mahamahim ho gaye or unke bare main baat nahin ho sakati
 He said whether the President and the Prime Minister are higher than God, who cannot be questioned
 janatantr kaa matlab sawaal poochna he or agar iskaa matlab deshadroh he to vah isaki sajaa bhugatne ko taiyaar hai
 During this, Hazare was present on the stage
 team anna ke ek or ahm sadsy prashanth bhushan ne bhi mukherjee, pradhanmantri singh or grahamantri pi
 Again attacked Chidambaram and repeated his allegations
 bhushan ne kaha, ‘kaha ja rahaa he ki ham pradhanmantri or kendriya mantriyon par aarope lagaakar araajaktaa failaa rahe hai lekin agar mantri bhrasht hai to araajaktaa to badhegi hi
 Referring to the Naxalites, he said, "being fed up with corruption and poverty, people take up arms and become Maoists
" desh grihayuddh kii ore bad rahaa he
 'bhushan said that all the big parties, whether Congress or BJP have become puppets of all the big companies
 kejariwal ne kaha ki manish sitaudiya, gopal raay or vah anshan par baithe hai or ve agle 60 dinon tak anshan jari rakh sakate hai, aise main hajaare ko anshan nahin karnaa chahie kyonki unka praan desh ke liye bahut jaruri he

 Some protesters overpowered the Prime Minister
 surakshit awaas ke geton par bhi chadhate dekha gaya jinhen police ne aisa karne se roka
 Amid the debate on Team Anna forming a political party, Kejriwal said in the language of signs that which political party can provide a solution to the problem of corruption, it has to be ascertained and till the solution is found out, he will remain at Jantar Mantar
 kejariwal ne kaha ki vakt aa gaya he ki jab ladaai janalokapal se badi hokar sampurna kranti ke liye ho
 On the discussion about the reduction of crowds in Team Anna's fast, Kejriwal said that the truth is not the conduit of the crowd and in the end the victory will be true
 main sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko chunauti detaa hum ki ve apni reliyon main isse aadhi bheed ko bhi bina trakon or bason main bhar kar laakar dikhaaen
 Kejriwal appealed to the media and said that even in jp's revolution, the media had put itself at stake and this time too it should support the truth
 unhone kaha ki congress kii pole pattee khul rahi he jabaki bhaajapa kaa bhi vahi haal he
 Earlier, on the fourth day of Team Anna's fast, there was a large crowd of supporters, amidst the weekend and happy evening

 BJP spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said here that everyone has freedom of expression in a democratic system
 samaaj or sarkaar donon ko apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar he
 They are exercising their rights but no one should cross the border

 pichhali saal ramlila maidan kii tarah hi ravivaar se jantar mantar par bhi samarthakon or aane vaale logon ke liye rasoi lagaai jaaegi
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee has written in his latest book 'coalition Years 1996-2012' that he was expected to be elected as Prime Minister twice
 pehle 2004 main jab sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) satta main aayaa or duusari dfa 2012 raashtrapati chunaav se pehle
 Congress veteran Mukherjee also said that when Sonia Gandhi told Manmohan Singh her choice for the post of Prime Minister, he was really reluctant to join the government as a cabinet minister under Singh because at the time of Indira Gandhi Mukherjee was Finance Minister and Singh was his junior at that time
 lekin, unhone is baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki manmohan singh ek 'aakasmik pradhanmantri' (accidental prime ministar) the
 6 rumors related to the Taj Mahal, which the world believes are true! Mukherjee said, 'A strong nationalist, courageous and strong-minded man, Manmohan Singh was certainly not an' accidental Prime Minister '
 mujhe vishwaas he ki bhavishya manmohan singh ko ek alag prakaash main dekhegaa, jaise (purv pradhanmantri) pi
 V
 (narsingh raav) kaa aaj ke samay main moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Mukherjee wrote that when Sonia Gandhi rejected the proposal made by UPA leaders on May 18, 2004 to make her Prime Minister, speculation in the party and media about her (sonia's) choice was intensified
 jaane madar terresa ke alaava kin bharatiyon ko mila Nobel prizemukarji ne likhaa he, 'congress party main us vakt aam sahmati thi ki hone vaale pradhanmantri ko raajnneetik netaa hone ke saath saath party ke maamalon or prashasan kaa anubhav ho
 In this sense, after Sonia Gandhi refused, i was expected to become Prime Minister
 bharat kaa ye vitt mantri bana tha pakistan kaa pehla pradhanmantriunhone kaha, 'yah sambhaavna shaayad in tathyon ke adhaar par jataai ja rahi thi kyonki mere paas sarkaar main kaam karne kaa vyapak anubhav tha jabaki singh ke paas ek sudhaarwadi vitt mantri ke rup main paanch saal ke alaava civil survet kaa vyapak anubhav tha
 Eventually, Sonia Gandhi put forward her choice of Manmohan Singh and had to accept it
 lagaataar do videshi dauron par karaari haar ke baad ab iskaa asar team main bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Now the question is whether everything is going well between Team India captain Virat Kohli and Kochharvi Shastri
 haal hi main england daure ke badapractice machake mudde par captain kohli or coach shastri donon kii alag-alag raay saamne ai
 First Indian captain Virat Kohli said that he is not in favor of more practice matches
 haalanki shastri kaa kahana he ki australia main test siries shuru hone se pehle hamane adhik se adhik abhyaas match yojit karaane kaa board se anurodh kiya he
 Mushfiqur's big feat, ahead of Dhoni and Sangakkara, the Indian team will begin their tour of Australia in a three-match T20 series starting on 21 November
 bharat ko teen tii-20 antarrashtriya, teen vanade or chaar test maichon ke liye 21 november se 18 janvari ke bich australia kaa daura karnaa he
 Let us know that the practice matches before the Test series in England were described by Captain Kohli as a waste of time
 lekin ab coach shastri kii in baton se jaahir he ki vah captain se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Asia Cup 2018: It could be India's playing XI Indian team played only one practice match before the Test series on the tour of England
 asex ke khilaaf yah match bhi pehle chaar din ke liye prastaavit tha
 This was later reduced to three days at the request of Team India
 practice match ke bagaiyr, koi taiyaari nahin hone ke kaaran bharat ne south africa main 1-2 or england main 1-4 se siries ganvaai
 In such a situation, one should not be surprised if there is lack of coordination or dispute between the captain and the coach regarding some decisions in the near future

 But still this girl and her family have to live in the shadow of fear

 Many of them made their journey on foot, walking for days through the hills, then floating across the Naf River or the Bay of Bengal on make shift boats
 
 
 many of them injured, pregnant, elderly, etc
 Their ordeal didn’t end here

 In the second half of 2017, the world saw horrific images of ethnic cleansing from the Rakhine State of myanmar(burma)
 This violence drove nearly 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh - 60% are children! Many months later they are still highly vulnerable, living in overcrowded camps with no idea when or where they will ever belong
 
 
 even worse, when they will get their next meal
 AND
 
 
 as they finally start to settle and feel a sense of safety, monsoon season looms
 
 
 threatening to destroy all that they've built so far
 This is an entire generation of children that have no future in sight

 For the Rohingya children, over 300,000, in the camps in Bangladesh this is the only space that allows them to be kids
 These Child Friendly Spaces created by @unicef give kids access to art, music, dance, sport, and counseling etc
 The space has often proved to be very therapeutic, helping these kids deal with the horrific situations they faced
 
 the @unicef aid workers work tirelessly to make sure these children find their spirit again
 It doesn't matter where a child is from or what his or her circumstances are
 
 
 NO child deserves a life without hope for the future
 The world needs to care
 We need to care

 'this is little Shohida (8 months old), who stole my heart with her infectious smile
 It’s a poignant reminder of the dichotomy of life
 
 
 here she was getting all the help she needed, when just a few months before, her mother, Alada (who was only 19 years old at the time) walked for 15 days, while 6 months pregnant with her, to get across the border
 It shows us that there is hope left in this world
 When you're dealing with a mass exodus of thousands of people, who have been displaced from their homes and are desperate for refuge, the need for proper health and nutrition takes center stage
 
 
 especially for women and children
 On the various Unicef field visits i have taken, i am always surprised by the simple yet effective solutions that @unicef and their partners develop to deal with the most dire and pressing situations and issues
 This is something i experienced again today during my visit to the Nutrition Centre at the Jamtoli camp in Cox’s Bazar
 More than 60,000 babies have been born in the camps over the past 8 months, so this center is an essential resource for new mothers to learn about proper feeding and nutrition
 It all begins with the MUAC, a process where the child’s middle upper arm is measured to ascertain their nutrition level
 From there, aids create a program for the child and a nutrient rich, ready-to-eat peanut paste is portioned out for each child based on the severity of malnutrition
 At the Center mother’s are also taught basic hygiene and good health practices when they are in their homes

 'rohingyaon par hue julm ko lekar duniya bhar se awaajen uthi thim, lekin aaj tak is maamle kaa koi sthaayee hal nahin nikal sakaa
 Many Rohingya refugees have lost their close ones and are living in camps
 aapako bataa den ki myanmar main rahane vaale 2015 main rohingya musalamaanon ke khilaaf vahaan kii sena ne aakraamak abhiyaan ched diya tha
 After this lakhs of refugees started coming to Bangladesh

 India also provides relief material in these refugee camps, but no solution has been found to this problem
 desh kaa pet bharne vaale anndaata ek baar phir sadakon par hai
 40 thousand farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai on a 200-km trek, but there is no one to take care of them
 desh main 9 karodakisanpariwaar hai jisamen 6
 3 crore families are in debt
 karj main doobane ke kaaran 1995 ke baad se ab tak kareeb 4 lakh kisaan khudakushi kar chuke hai, isamen khudakushi karne vaale kareeb 76 hajaar kisaan akelemaharashtrase hai
 Most problems related to farming are from this state
 maharashtrahi nahin balki andhra pradesh, telugana, tamilnadu, karnataka, madhyapradesh, bihar, uttar pradesh, chhattisgarh, odisha or jharkhand jaise rajyon main bhi kisaan khudakushi karte rahe hai
 In 2017, farmers in these states committed the most suicides
 desh kirajnneetimen kisaanon kii ahm bhoomika rahati he
 About 70 percent of the people here are directly or indirectly involved in farming
 amuman har chunaav ke pehle raajnneetik dal kisaanon kii karj maafee kii baat karte hai, lekin chunaav khatm hone ke baad us par kuch khaas dhyaan nahin dete jisase kisaan sadak par andolan karne ko majaboor hote hai
 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report states that the rate of suicide among farmers under the burden of debt is continuously increasing
 2005 se 2015 ke bich 10 saal ke aankadon par najar daalaa jaae to desh main har ek lakh kii aabaadi par 1
 4 to 1 8 kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai
 Farmers agitating in Maharashtra demand that the government's promise of loan waiver last year should be fully implemented
 bina kisi shart ke sabhi kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya jaae
 Electricity bill should also be waived
 saath hi kisaanon kaa kahana he ki swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu kiya jaae or garib or majhule kisaanon ke karj puri tarah se maaf kiye jaaen
 Another major demand of farmers is that the problems related to the allocation of tribal forest land should be resolved so that tribal farmers can get the ownership of their lands
 ye chand ahm maangen he kisaanon kii, iske alaava unki kai or maangen bhi he jise puraa kiya gaya to unki sthiti main sudhaar aa sakati he
 Usually every government declares itself to be friendly to the farmers, but after a hiatus the farmers have been forced to hit the road
 maharashtra main phir se hajaaron kii sankhya main kisaan sadak par utre hai, hamaare anndaataaon kii maang itani nazaij bhi nahin he ki sarkaar ke paas isko lekar jawaab dete na bane
 The government should answer important questions related to the existence of farmers, and should try not to force them to hit the road again and again

 This is the province that elects the highest number of Lok Sabha mps
 agle do charnon main rajya kii kul milakar 27 siton par matdaan hona he
 All the seats are from the eastern part of UP
 isamen banaras or gorakhpur jaisi loksabhaa siten bhi shaamil hai
 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is contesting from Banaras, Gorakhpur seat is considered to be the stronghold of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 2014 main, bijepi or sahyogi dalon ne 73siten jeetin thim
 This performance also continued in the 2017 assembly elections
 jab bijepi ne kul 403 main se 312 siton par fatah hasil kii thi
 This time, compared to 2014, many things are making a difference on the Lok Sabha elections
 gathbandhan se is baar kaa chunaav kuch alag he
 Because in comparing the vote share of the 2017 assembly elections to the votebank of the Lok Sabha constituency-wise parties, the vote of the alliance in many places is overshadowing the bjp's votebank
 doosraa bada antar priyanka gandhi wadra kaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's younger sister took over as the in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, making her debut in the much-awaited active politics in February this year
 pichley kuch maheenon se logon kaa kahana he ki unhone kaaphi prabhaav choda he or congress ke maton main das pratishat kii vruddhi kar sakati he
 But it may have the opposite effect on the Grand Alliance
 kyonki congress ke vot agar bijepi virdohi kheme se aaenge to phir yah gathbandhan ke liye mahangaa padegaa
 Last time, 41 percent of the votes of BJP got 85 percent seats
 magar 41 pratishat vot ko lahar kaha jaae
 Such a definition is not found in books
 1977 main janata party ke paksh main jarur ek lahar thi, jab party ko 48 pratishat vot share mili the
 In 2015, Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party secured 53 percent of the votes in the assembly elections
 2015 main 'modi wave' kaa jo turm prachlan main aayaa, darasal vah landslide victory thi
 It is important to know the difference between wave and landslide
 'wave' yani lahar 'hai popular' vot se tay hoti he, jabaki landslide adhik sankhya main siten aane se
 Uttar Pradesh is a state where more Dalits and Muslims live than other parts of the country
 yahaan nagareey ilaakon se zyada log gaanvon main rahete hai
 But this time, the Scheduled Caste vote is moving away from the BJP
 yah vot congress or sapa-basapa gathbandhan main bant rahaa he
 The Muslim vote is also going to the Congress and the alliance
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bijepi ke paale se kareeb 15 pratishat dalit dur ho rahe hai
 In this, 10 percent vote to Congress and five percent to coalition
 mahagathbandhan ko muslimon kaa 75 pratishat or congress ko 25 pratishat vot mil rahaa he
 Similar votes were also distributed in 2014
 bijepi kaa jaadu yuvaaon par chal rahaa he
 The number of such youth is 18 to 25 years
 iske alaava mahilaon or anya pichhadaa varg(obisi) kaa bhi bijepi ko saath mil rahaa he
 The BJP is expected to get 55 percent of the OBC electorate, 35 seats to the Grand Alliance and 10 percent to the Congress
 vahiin 18-25 varsh ke 50 pratishat matadaata bijepi ke paale main khadey dikh rahe hai
 The alliance is also likely to create a stir among the upper castes
 ucch varg ko bijepi kaa voter mana jaataa he
 There are nine 'bell Weather' seats in Uttar Pradesh, that is, which are considered to be the condition of political season
 ye siten aksar jeetne vaali party ke ummidavaaron ko hi chunati ai he
 Apart from this, three seats have always been electing the opposite candidates of the stream
 yani chunaav jeetne vaale dal ke candidate yahaan nahin jitate
 Thus, the seats of Amethi, Rae Bareli and Azamgarh fall under the category of "alta Belvedar"
 vahiin hawa ke rukh ke saath chalane vaaleen belwedar siton main rampur, hardoi
 The last phase of voting will take place on 19 and the results will be on 23

 Indian captain Rohit Sharma, while giving credit to the entire team in the first T20 match against Sri Lanka, praised Mahendra Singh Dhoni who landed at number four and scored useful runs in the death overs, besides the usual behind the wicket
 Exhibited
 rohit ne bharat kii 93 ran se jeet ke baad kaha, ‘keel rahul ne top order main shandaar ballebaaji kii or dhoni, manish pandey ne pari kaa shandaar ant kiya
 Dhoni's answer is no
 unhen number chaar par utaarne kaa vastav main phayda mila
 He has won many matches for us and i think number four is ideal for him
 ’katak tii-20: team india ne srilanka ko 93 ranon se peeta, rahul or chahal chamakerohit ne iske saath hi kaha ki toss haarane se koi khaas asar nahin padaa
 He said, 'the toss didn't make much of a difference, because the dew was there from the beginning
 hamen ummid thi ki yah puure 40 over tak rahegi or aakhir tak kuch bhi nahin badla
 It was not easy to bat even later
 ’rohit ne yujavendra chahal or kuldeep yadav kii spin jodi kii bhi tarif kii

 ve jaanate hai ki team unase kya chaahati he or vah usee ke anusaar pradarshan karte hai

 captain kool mahendra singh dhoni ne apni captaini main team india ko tii-20 world cap jitayaa, test main best banaaya, world jitayaa or vanade main bhi number van banaaya
 But now the situation seems to be changing
 aisa lagane laga he ki maahi team ko apni jaagir samajhane lage hai or unki isi jid ke chalate team lagaataar pit rahi he
 After the defeat in South Africa, the team has lost two odis in New Zealand and with it has lost the number-1 crown in odis
 newjiland daure par duusare vanade main dhoni ne 4 aisi galtiyaan kii jo haar kii ahm vajah bhi bani
 Let's have a look what are these four mistakes - mistake why winning the toss - 1 Why bat first? Dhoni won the toss but did not decide to bat first here as in the first match
 jab baar-baar team india pehle gendbaaji karke haar rahi he to phir se is galati ko dohraane kaa kya matlab he? pichley 5 vanade main 4 baar dhoni ne toss jeeta or pehle gendbaaji kii or har baar team india ko munh kii khaani padi
 Why not change in mistake number-2 team? The logic of not winning the winning combination is understandable, but despite the constant defeats, how is this insistence on Dhoni not changing the team? The team lost badly in South Africa, then in the first ODI in New Zealand
 jab team main kam se kam do badlaav kii puri gunjaaish thi tab dhoni ne vahi haari hui team ko maidan par utaar diya
 The result was again the same and the team lost the number-1 crown
 galati number-3kamjor kadi team main kyon? jo khilaadi har baar kamjor kadi sabit ho rahe hai, unhen team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ke bajaay dhoni baar-baar maukey die ja rahe hai
 Ishant Sharma is the senior most bowler in the team, who is the weakest bowler in bowling, but again and again he is proving not only expensive but a complete failure
 kuch aisa hi haal aswin kaa bhi he jis gendbaaj kaa kaam wicket chatakaane kaa he wo to wicket nikaalane kii kala hi jaise bhul gaya he
 Ashwin has got just 1 wicket in the last 7 international innings
 pichley 5 vanade main aswin ne 46 over phenkane ke baad 1 wicket liya
 Who are the weak batsmen in the batting? Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina These three batsmen have disappointed the last few matches
 shikhar dhawan ne pichley 5 maichon main sirf 56 ran banaae hai
 After scoring a double century in odis, Rohit Sharma's form has dropped such that he does not run anymore
 pichley 5 vanade main rohit ne mahaj 15 kii ausat se ran banaae hai
 After Dhoni, the senior-most batsman Suresh Raina's struggle with form has been prolonged
 galati number-4do spinner kyon? newjiland kii conditions main do spinner kargar sabit nahin ho rahe hai
 If the bowling of Ashwin and Jadeja from above is also not effective, then why is Dhoni playing with two spinners by putting 2-2 pace bowlers on the bench? What is the compulsion to not change the coin which is proving to be a bad thing again and again? This defeat is also pricking now because Team India is not only losing continuously abroad, but now the team number eight in the ODI rankings The number-1 team has been forced to slip to the second position

 Film director Mahesh Bhatt, who has launched many Pakistani actors through his films in Bollywood, has recently put his side on the controversy of banning Pakistani actors and their films in the country
 mahesh bhatta ne kaha he ki pakistani kalakaaron kii bharat main ho rahi khilaafat bhi isi aatankwaad kaa hi dushprinaam he or aatankwaad yahi chahta he donon deshon main vivaad bade
 Mahesh Bhatt said this in Chandigarh on Saturday on the performance of the play The Last Salute based on the book The Last Salute to President Bush written by Iraqi journalist munnatuddar-al-zaidi

 Khilafat of Pakistani artists in India is also the result of this terrorism

 Bhatt said that his personal opinion is that terrorism should be curbed but people-to-people contacts of both countries should remain
 donon deshon ke logon ko apni sarkaron par har masale ko baatcheet se hal karne ke liye dabaav bananaa chahie
 Bhatt said that people should try to stop the war rather than to fight

 This film was started when everything was fine between the two countries and our Prime Minister himself went to Pakistan to meet Nawaz Sharif and now when the relationship has deteriorated, Karan Johar's film is being opposed
 is desh ke logon ko ye tay karnaa hoga ki ye desh logon ke mood ke hisaab se chalegaa yaa phir policy ke hisaab se
 Aomesh Bhatt, who did not act like Pakistan, said that if the central government makes a policy regarding Pakistani artists then we will accept it

 assam ke neshnal register of citigens (NRC) ko taiyaar karne kii puri prakriya supreme court kii nigaraanee main kareeb teen saal tak chali
 Now the draft NRC has come out, more than 40 lakh people have not been involved in it
 ajtak-india today kii team dwaara fact check karne se pataa chalata he ki agar enarasi ke survey karne vaale kuch behatar kaam karte or assam tathaa duusare kai rajyon ke prashasan ne mustaidi dikhaai hoti to yah sankhya kaaphi kam ho sakati thi
 The Fact Check team spoke to all sources
 usase yah pataa chalata he ki bahut se logon ko apane bhartiya mul kaa hone kaa daawa sabit karne ke liye data yaa dastavej uplabdh nahin ho paae
 Significantly, for the residents of Assam to prove their citizenship, being named in the NRC of 1951 and in the voter list before midnight of March 24, 1971, was collectively referred to as Legacy
 saal 2015 main shuru hui is kavayad main logon ke dastavejon kii vaidhata kii jaanch or field veriphication kiya gaya or uske baad draft enarasi taiyaar hua
 Let us know what is the reason that 4 million people were left out of this list
 1
 Link Linking Documents: Linking documents include land documents, birth and death certificates, university or school degrees, names in a voter list or ration card, and bank / insurance / post office records
 enarasi kii sharton ke mutabik kisi aavedak ko 1951 kii enarasi main shaamil yaa 1971 tak kii matadaata suchi main shaamil apane bhartiya purvajon se rishta sabit karne ke liye uparokt main se koi bhi dastavej pesh karnaa tha
 But many people outside NRC failed to provide any such linkage document that could prove their family heritage
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi gramin mahila ko kisi cirkil officer, gram panchayat sachiv yaa sarpanch se hasil marij certificate pesh karnaa tha
 The NRC survey team also carried out physical verification of such documents
 team ko yah pataa chalaa ki tamaam vivaahit mahilaayein apane viraasat ke dastavej jaise pita ke bare main pramaan nahin pesh kar pain, jaahir he ki jin mahilaon kaa maayka kaaphi dur yaa duusare rajya main he, unke liye yah mushkil kaam tha
 Prateek Hajela, Coordinator of NRC, told Aaj tak-india Today that the biggest reason for not being able to submit the linkage document was that many applications were rejected
 2
 Incomplete voter lists To validate citizenship, it was important that the applicant's proof of inheritance be in the voter list and the 1951 NRC
 1951 ke baad kii sabhi jilon kii matadaata suchi ko online or enarasi seva kendron (NSK) main uplabdh kiya gaya
 Documents from the RTI filed in the nrc's executive director's office show that some districts are missing some year's voter lists
 nae enarasi draft main badi sankhya main logon kaa aavedan khaarij hone kii yah bhi ek vajah he
 Hajela says that the applicants were asked to present some more documents in its option, but it seems that they did not
 3
 After the 1951 census, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was prepared in the same year across the country
 isamen 1951 kii janaganana ke har vyakti ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 This register was kept in the offices of deputy commissioners and sdms of the districts
 baad main ise police ko saunp diya gaya
 The RTI documents confirm that NRC data of 1951 of three districts - Sivasagar, Cachar and Karbi Anglong are missing
 jaankaron ko ashanka he ki bahut se logon ke aavedan khaarij hone kii yah bhi ek vajah he
 Hajela claims that when the process of drafting the register started in 2015, all such things were considered
 lekin aisa lagata nahin ki is maamle main koi riyaayat mili he

 Mahmood Madni said, 'my statement in Jaipur was misrepresented
 maine sirf yahi kaha tha ki congress ye na samajhe ki musalmaan sirf use vot denge
 The Congress should not be under the illusion that by creating fear of Modi it will get the vote of the Muslim community
 'mahmud madani ne kaha, 'khud ko secular bataane vaali partiyaan ko muslim samudaay ko lekar apana agenda bataanaa chahie
 What did he do for Muslims and what is the plan to do next? wo is buniyaad par vot lene kii koshish karen na ki kisi kaa dar dikhaakar
 'he said,' i want to say to every party that we must do politics to take votes but not negative but positive agenda
 majahab or dharm ke naam par vot na maange jaae or na hi is par raajnneeti ho
 Asked questions about Modi's support, he said, "I am not supporting him
" kisi kaa dar dikhaakar vot lene se manaa karnaa alag cheez he or sidhe-sidhe paksh main bolnaa alag baat
 Because of Modi's image and the way he used to win elections in Gujarat, he has always been in the news

 For the moment, i will not open my cards on Modi

 The controversy arose after this statement by Mahmud Madni

 Pointing to the promises made to the people of Bihar during the election campaign, Manjhi said, "now to see Modi's work, talking and doing is different
" ' unhone kaha ki bihar ke vikaas ke liye kendra ne baraabar sautela vyavhaar kiya he
 The Raghuram Rajan Committee found Bihar worthy of special state status, but till date, Bihar did not get special state status
 maanjhi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang ko lekar jo ladaai prarambh kii thi, use jari rakhaa jayega
 He said, 'we will continue the fight till we achieve this
 bihar centre kii nai sarkaar par dabaav banaae rakhegi
 When asked that Modi, like him, comes from a very backward caste, Manjhi said, "I don't know about Modi's caste, but he himself promoted it during the election campaign
 'unhone kaha ki ve yahaan isliye hai kyonki nitish kumaar ne kuch apratyaashit prayog kiya he
 Manjhi, coming from a Mahadalit family, has completed her journey as a shepherd in childhood, later a farm laborer and then a clerk to the Chief Minister today
 unhone kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi raajnneeti ko satta hasil karne kaa jariya nahin samajha or unke liye yah samaajik kaam he
 He said that his first priority would be to speed up all the development schemes initiated by the Nitish government
 unhone kaha ki bihar kii pahchaan ko lekar purv mukhyamantri ne jin kaaryon ko apane haath main liya tha, unhen puraa karuunga

 behad karine se rahasypurna banaai gai is jaankaree ne hamen thodaa-sa bhramit or zyada jaankaree hasil karne ke liye thodaa utsuk bana diya he
 Stroke-like symptoms can occur in every stroke, but it seems that not every symptom is caused by stroke
 doctor sahab, lihaaja vah stroke tha yaa nahin tha? agar vah stroke hi tha, to hua kahaan tha? agar vah sirf ''stroke jaisaa'' tha, to aap shaayad hamen bataa sakate hai ki vah kiske jaisaa tha
 Sir, please don't mind me, but was there something special in these "symptoms" that required him to be treated in Dubai and your 'soft hands and of course your brilliant mind? Is Islamabad, or There are no such qualified doctors in Lahore, or Karachi, who can cure these nameless symptoms? The question arises because the pompous pranks of Pakistan and the vile rumor of India are spreading that the Sadar of Pakistan does not trust any hospital in his country, and they are afraid that they may be poisoned or such That something could happen
 beshak, yah sahi nahin ho saktaa, kyonki agar koi sadar apane hi logon par bharosa nahin kar saktaa, to use ohade par bane rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 But apparently when you told about those bad symptoms, the unworthy journalists of the west spread the news that Zardari "is resting at his home in Dubai to improve his health
" '' agar islamabad apane sadar ke liye behad jaruri aaraam karne laayak bhi mahfuj nahin he, to phir to halaat bahut hi kharaab hai
 Isn't it, Sir, you have a lot of knowledge about diseases, so i hope you can tell something about it without breaking the Bokrat (hippocrates)

 Among them, 26-year-old Kavya Bagga, a management student of BHU, dressed in branded clothes standing next to her scooty, will get Pramod Kumar, the middle-aged in local politics

 In such a situation, there is no doubt of the shop owner Ramji Yadav that even a veteran leader like former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar has tasted the jalebi here, then famous classical singer rajan-sajan Mishra passes through here and does not forget to taste it

 ' jab bhi kabhi 'big fat vaiding' kii baat hoti he, sabase pehle dimag main hindustani shaadiyaan hi aati hai
 
 
 In our country, an attempt is usually made to make the wedding so grand that the guests feel that they have reached the wedding of a king-king
 
 
 hindustan main hone vaali shaadiyon ko dekhakar kisi kaa bhi mantrmugdh ho janaa behad aam baat he
 
 
 Indian weddings adorned with bright colors from all over the world have guests arriving in hundreds, sometimes thousands, and there are plenty of rituals to perform, which have different ceremonies
 
 
 ab sochie, aisi hi kisi shaadi ko aap puri tarah sirf apane haath main thame yphone ke jariye 'cover' kar rahe hai
 
 
 Did not feel shocked
 
 
 ?tippaniyan But Israel's award-winning photographer Sephi Bergerson has done just that
 
 
 unhone haal hi main rajasthan ke udaipur shahar main hui ek shandaar shaadi ko sirf apane yphone 6es plus (iphone 6S Plus) ke jariye shoot kiya, or yakeen maniye, nattejey kisi bhi shaadi kii aam album ke mukaable kahin zyaada shandaar hai
 
 
 Talking to Mashable, Sefi said, "there are no special tricks for photography
 
 
 agar main aapke haath main jimi hendrix (jimi Hendrix) kaa guitar pakadaa duun, to aap uski tarah guitar bajaane nahin lagenge
 
 
 It does not rely on equipment
 
 
 " unki khinchi hui is shaadi kii tasveeron ko dekhne ke baad to ham bhi sephi se puri tarah sahamat ho gaye hai
 
 
 In a video uploaded to youtube, explaining in detail how to photography such a big event from the iphone, Sephy told Mashable that these photos are also fine art, and photo journalism
 
 
 vah kehete hai, "main apane graahakon se hameshaa kahata rahata hum ki photo kheenchna is bare main nahin hota ki shaadi main koun-koun shaamil hua, balki is bare main hota he ki aap us kshan kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 
 
 Later, when you look at those pictures, you will be able to feel the same feeling again, only then is the success
 
 
 " We would like to tell you that Sephi not only captured these pictures through iphone, but also did post-production work on those pictures on iphone itself
 
 
 so, hamaare khyal se jin logon ko yphone yaa photography yaa hindustani shaadiyon yaa teenon main dilchaspee he, unke liye yah video behad khubasurat inaam sabit hoga, lekin ham yah soch rahe hai ki kya aane vaale vakt main yphone hi DSLR camaron kii jagah le lenge
 
 
 Well, the answer will only give time to come, so watch this video right now
 
 
 lekin israel ke puraskrit photographer sephi burgerasan (sephi Bergerson) ne thik aisa hi kar dikhaaya he
 
 
 He recently shot a spectacular wedding in Udaipur city of Rajasthan only through his iphone 6S Plus, and believe it, the results are more spectacular than any wedding album
 
 
 Mashable se baatcheet karte hue sephi ne bataaya, "photography ke liye koi khaas tarkiben nahin hoti hai
 
 
 If i hold the guitar of Jimi Hendrix in your hand, you won't be playing guitar like that
 
 
 yah upkaran ke bharose nahin hota he
 
 
 "after seeing the pictures of this wedding drawn by him, we too have completely agreed with Sephi
 
 
 utyub par aplod kiye ek video main yphone se itane bade samaaroh kii photography karne ke bare main vistaar se samajhaate hue sephi ne Mashable se kaha ki ye tasviren fine art bhi hai, or photo jarnalism bhi
 
 
 He says, "I always tell my clients that taking a photo is not about who attended the wedding, but about how you feel at that moment
 
 
 baad main jab aap un tasveeron ko dekhen, to usee ehsaas ko dobaaraa mahasoos kar paaen, tabhi kamyaabi he
 
 
 " ham aapako bataanaa chahenge ki sephi ne na sirf ye tasviren yphone ke jariye khinchin, balki un tasveeron par post-production kaa kaam bhi yphone par hi kiya
 
 
 So, for those of us who are interested in iphone or photography or Indian weddings or all three, this video will prove to be a great reward, but we are wondering if the iphone will replace DSLR cameras in the coming times
 
 
 
 khayr, jawaab to aane vaala vakt hi degaa, so, philhal yah video dekhie

 Navjot Singh Sidhu's awaaz-e-punjab Front has come to a complete breakdown and Sidhu, who talks about sacrificing everything for Punjab, has not been able to step into Punjab for the last 4 months
 siddhu ke darshan punjab ke logon ko bas tii
 V
 par hi ho rahe hai halaat ye ho gaye hai ki navjot singh siddhu jo ek vakt main king mekar ban kar ubhar rahe the, unhen na to ab koi raajnneetik party puch rahi he or naa hi aawaaj e punjab front khadaa karne ke dauraan unke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar khadey unke sahyogi balki unke do khaas sahyogi ludhiana se vidhayak bains bandhu to siddhu se bina mashwara kiye hi aam aadmi party kaa daaman bhi tham chuke hai or pargat singh bhi ishaaron main kah hi chuke hai ki wo bhi zyada intjaar nahin kar sakate or congress main unka janaa tay ho chukaa he
 Earlier there was hope of going with AAP, there was a time when both Aam Aadmi Party and Congress wanted to bring Navjot Singh Sidhu into their court
 unako baari bharkam ofer de rahi thi, in ophers main navjot singh siddhu kii patni navjot cor ke liye bhi mantri pad jaise ofer or navjot singh siddhu ke liye dipti siem kaa pad die jane kii baat thi
 But perhaps Sidhu's ambition was more than this, that is why Sidhu kept talking to the Aam Aadmi Party and sometimes the Congress
 haalanki siddhu ke sahyogi pargat singh or ludhiana se vidhayak bandhu bains bros ne unhen puraa mauka or vakt diya ki siddhu koi faisla len, lekin siddhu shaayad apane tivi ke moh ko chhod nahin paae or is kaa nateeja yah niklaa ki ab siddhu ke sahyogi bains bros unka daaman chhod chuke hai or pargat singh bhi siddhu kaa haath chhod kar congress kaa haath jald hi thaamne vaale hai
 Navjot Singh Sidhu may be in the headlines in the Congress, although the discussions of going to Congress and AAP are also common, but his front voice, a-punjab, created just after leaving BJP, got a big shock when his front Two big leaders, Ludhiana MLA Simarjit Singh and Balwinder Singh, known as Bains Brothers
 donon ne bina navjot singh siddhu or unke sahyogi pargat singh ke, aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan kar liya
 According to the alliance between the Lok Insaaf Party and the Aam Aadmi Party, the party of Bains Brothers, the Lok Insaaf Party will field its candidates in five seats and support the Aam Aadmi Party on the remaining seats
 haalanki is maukey par jab bains bros se yah sawaal poocha gaya ki unhone bina navjot singh siddhu ke hi yah gathbandhan kar liya he to unka kahana tha ki unhone logon kii maang par yah gathbandhan kiya he or navjot singh siddhu or pargat singh unke bade bhai hai or un donon ko bhi is gathbandhan ke bare main jaankaree de di gai he
 But when Pargat Singh was talked to, he expressed regret and surprise and said that i wish that the Bains brothers would go on talking, as well as Pargat indicated that they too can go to the Congress soon
 jald lenaa hoga faislis vajah se navjot singh siddhu par baari dabaav he ki vah apane raajnneetik bhavishya ko lekar jald se jald koi faisla le len nahin to punjab kii raajnneeti main vah alag-thalag pad jaaenge
 Sidhu now has the last chance to either support the Aam Aadmi Party with the Bains Brothers unconditionally or accept the invitation given to him by the Congress for an unconditional party for a long time
 Do it haalanki in donon hi surat main siddhu or unki patni ko koi baari bharkam raajnneetik phayda milane kii ummid nahin he
 In such a situation, it is also being said that now Sidhu has only one option and that is Congress because both the Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party have announced their most candidates, so the Congress is the one to adjust Sidhu somewhere
 It is in the capacity of Prabhu and perhaps now Sidhu will have to talk about Punjab Punjabiyat and Punjabis too

 The Congress and its president Rahul Gandhi have been attacking the Modi government at the Center for a long time on the Rafale case
 ek baar phir congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par rafel vimaan saude main desh ke saath samjhauta karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 He also said that his party's demand for a JPC probe on the Rafale case is correct as it is not the court but parliamentary committee that can investigate on this issue
 congress netaa or purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne media main us report kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki saude main bhartiya vaayu sena (aieef) unki jarurat ke 90 vimaan se vanchit karte hue sarkari khajaane se daso company ko har vimaan par 186 karod rupee kaa munafa diya gaya
 In 2015, orders for 36 jet fighter aircraft were signed at a 41 per cent higher price per aircraft

 Chidambaram further said that no one has ever answered this question, whether Prime Minister or Defense Minister (nirmala Sitharaman), Finance Minister (arun Jaitley) or Law Minister (ravi Shankar Prasad)
 sabhi ne kisi na kisi prakaar se sirf rafel saude kaa bachaav kiya
 Referring to the 13 India Specific Enhancements (india-centric reforms) on the demand of the Indian Air Force (IAF), former Finance Minister Chidambaram said that the deal price was around 1
 3 arab euro thi, jiskaa bhugtan upie or modi ke saude donon main kiya janaa tha
 He said that if 126 aircraft were bought, Dassau would have 1 in more than ten and a half years

 He said that Dassau Company benefited from two sides

 The Modi government has done harm to the country in two ways
 pehla, bhartiya vayusena ko 90 vimaanon se vanchit kiya jisaki use sakht jarurat he or doosraa yah ki har vimaan par 2

 The riddle of the death of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari, son of former veteran Congress leader, Chief Minister and Governor ND Tiwari, was finally solved

 Rohit, who was killed on April 15, was returning to Delhi from Uttarakhand
 tab video colling ke zarie apurva ne rohit ko ek mahila rishtedaar ke saath car main sharaab pite dekha
 The quarrel just started from here
 praparty kaa jhagada pehle se hi tha
 However, Apoorva says that Rohit was killed suddenly
 10 april 2019, dephence colony, nai dilhirohit shekhar tiwari apni maa ujjwala sharma, ek mahila rishtedaar, naukar golu or driver akhilesh ke saath apni car main uttarakhand ke liye ravaanaa hota he
 Voting was on April 11 for the first phase in Uttarakhand
 rohit or uski maa kaa vot uttarakhand ke kathgodam ilaake main tha
 After five days stay in Kathgodam, all return to Delhi, Rohit was drinking alcohol in the car all the way
 chunki safar lanbaa tha lihaaza dilli pahunchate-pahunchate wo kaaphi zyada nashe main ho chukaa tha
 On April 15, 2019, Defense Colony, Delhi, after a seven-eight-hour journey, Rohit and his family reach home between ten and half past ten
 ghar aane ke baad rohit raat kareeb 11 baje akele khaanaa khaataa he or apane kamare main chalaa jaataa he
 After this, Rohit's mother, Bada Bai Siddharth, wife Apoorva and household servants etc
 also eat food
 khaanaa khaane ke baad rohit kii maa tilak len ke apane ghar chalaa jaati hai
 Female relatives also move away
 maa ke jane ke baad bhai siddharth or naukar, driver bhi apane-apane kamare main chale jate hai
 There was no camera on the first floor of the house
 rohit kaa cameraa vahiin tha
 Then there were only three people apart from Rohit
 apurva, rohit kaa naukar golu or driver akhilesh
 Golu and Akhilesh were hired by Rohit
 in donon kaa parivaar rohit kii selary par hi palata tha
 Around 12 in the night
 45 baje apurva rohit ke kamare main jaati he
 She was the last person to go to Rohit's room
 rohit buree tarah nashe main tha
 There is a fight between Rohit and Apoorva in the room
 jhagada is baat par bhi tha ki rohit mahila rishtedaar ke saath sharaab kyon pi rahaa tha
 During this quarrel, Apurva angrily pressed Rohit's throat, mouth and nose with a pillow
 chunki rohit shaam se hi sharaab pi rahaa tha or is kadar main nashe main tha ki apana bachaav nahin kar sakaa
 The way Apoorva pressed Rohit's throat, mouth and nose, he came to know that Rohit was dead
 iske baad wo rohit ke kamare se nikal kar afne kamare main chali jaati he
 When Rohit's throat was strangled, it was ringing around night
 rohit ko neend naa aane kii beemaari thi
 He often woke up all night
 or din main hameshaa der tak sota tha
 So when he did not wake up the next day from morning till noon and then till four in the evening, no one in the house had any doubt as to why Rohit is not awake
 lekin dephence colony ke is ghar main ek shaks thi, jise maaloom tha ki rohit ab kabhi nahin uthegaa
 Who knew that Rohit's room is not Rohit but his body
 par wo bhi intjaar kar rahi thi ki ye khabar koi or de
 Finally, at four o'clock in the evening, Rohit's servant Golu gives this news to everyone for the first time and everyone comes to know about Rohit's death
 or jab police maamle kii tahakikat karti hui apurv se poochtacha kar rahi thi to vah chikhakar boli- haa maine hi rohit ko maaraa he

 yogi sarkaar ko upi kii satta sanbhale ek hafte se adhik samay ho gaya he
 From the very first day, Yogi Sarkar is in action mode
 bina ek bhi cabinet meeting ke siem yogi 50 se adhik faisle le chuke hai
 Especially the action of the Yogi government against the anti-romeo squad and slaughterhouses
 iske alaava bijli vyavastha sudhaarney, sarkari system ko chust-durust karne or daftaron main anushaasan par siem yogi kaa khaas jor he
 The reason is that Yogi Sarkar has not 5 but just two years
 isi do saal main apane kaam ko sabit karnaa he or 2019 kii siyaasi jang isi kaam ke boote jeetna he
 With the help of PM Modi, the people of UP have given a majority to the BJP and now Modi and Yogi have to win the 2019 battle by making a change in the biggest state of the country
 upi se piem modi ke ye paanch vaade hai, jin par yogi sarkaar sabase pehle praathamikta ke saath kaam karegi or 2019 kii raah aasaan karne kii koshish karegi
 1
 vakt kam-chunautiyaan hajaaryogi sarkaar bhale hi 5 saal ke liye satta main ai he, lekin 2019 ke aam chunaav main ab bas do saal shesh he
 For his second innings in the politics of the Center, UP matters to Modi
 upi se loksabhaa kii 80 siten aati hai
 In the 2014 elections, BJP won 71 out of 80 seats
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhi banpar jeet hasil hui he
 Now the challenge is to keep it intact
 upi ko badalane ke vaade ke saath modi ne logon ke bich chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 Now the Yogi government has the responsibility to fulfill it
 yahi kaaran he ki yogi sarkaar pehle hi din se ection mod main he
 There may not have been a single cabinet meeting in a week, but more than 50 odd decisions have been taken
 khaskar system or sarkari daftaron main aam logon kii samasyaayein suni jaaen iske liye siem yogi sarkari afasaron or karmchaariyon par sakht dikh rahe hai
 2
 udyog hi nahin krishi ko banaaenge vikaas kaa injansatta main aate hi siem yogi ne pehle din elaan kiya ki kheti ko upi kii tarakkee kaa aadhaar banaaenge
 Along with this, giving employment to the youth and stopping migration, is its priority
 upi main nai sarkaar ke satta sambhalate hi piem modi ne pradesh sarkaar ke liye apana rodmap pesh kiya tha
 The PM said - Development is our prime and purpose and the development of Uttar Pradesh will lead to the development of the country
 ab yogi sarkaar ko parform karnaa he
 Uttar Pradesh has a population of 22 crores i
e
 16 percent of the country's population, but up's share in GDP is only 12 percent
 prati vyakti aay main upi 31wein number par hai
 In UP, 30 per cent are poor, while at the national level this figure is 22 per cent
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar upi main vikaas hota he, to desh kii vikaas dar ek fisadi bad jaaegi
 Therefore, the Modi government has to give special importance to Uttar Pradesh
 yahi kaaran he ki piem modi ne yogi sarkaar ko paanv jamaane main madad ke liye apane sabase bharosemand afasar nripendd mishra ko lakhanu bheja

 anti romeo kanoon se khatm hongi kanoon-vyavastha kii chunautiyaan?chunaav prachaar ke dauraan piem modi ne akhilesh sarkaar par kanoon-vyavastha ko lekar sidhi chot kii
 Modi continued to say that the law and order situation in the Akhilesh government is absolutely collapsed
 betiyaan shaam main ghar se nikalne se darati hai or bijepi agar satta main ai to thanon ko sapa karyaalay se waapas police thanon main tabdeel kiya jayega
 Now the government is of BJP and the challenges are also of BJP
 yogi sarkaar ke satta sanbhaalane ke pehle din hi elahabaad main bisapi ke ek netaa kii goli markar hatya kar di gai
 The case of rape of two sisters in Lakhimpur Kheri added to the challenges
 yogi sarkaar ne har jile main anti romeo dasta banaakar mahila suraksha kii ore kadam to badhaayaa he lekin mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh rokane ke liye or sakht kadam uthaane honge
 Success on this front will present UP as a role model to the rest of the states

 When will the smile on the face of farmers? PM Modi said in the March 4 rally in Jaunpur that a new government will be formed after Holi and after the formation of the government, a decision will be taken for the loan waiver of the farmers
 ab yogi sarkaar ko satta sanbhale 8 din ho chuke hai
 Millions of farmers in UP are waiting for the debt waiver decision
 esbiai or arabiai ne karj maafee ke trend ko nuksaandaayak bataaya he or vitt mantri jetali bhi sansad main elaan kar chuke hai ki centre kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin karegi
 Obviously now the Yogi government will have to declare the debt waiver of the farmers on the basis of its resources
 centre sarkaar jaanati he ki agar upi ke kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya to baaki rajyon main karnaa padegaa or iske liye sansadhano kii phir chunauti hogi
 Before the 2019 war, the Yogi government has to not only waive off farmers 'debts but also fulfill Modi's promise to increase agriculture and double farmers' income

 Atal on the agenda of Hindutva? Without a single Muslim candidate, the BJP, who came to the UP election summer, gave a Muslim minister a place in the cabinet as soon as he came into government
 yogi ke chayan ko vishleshkon ne modi ke shmasaan banaam ramajaan bayaan kaa ekstansion bataaya
 Yogi himself has been raising issues like Kairana, Love Jihad prominently in his election rallies
 ram mandir ke mudde ko yogi mudda nahin bhaavnaatmak maamla bataate hai
 Now Yogi is in power and he has to live up to all these promises of BJP
 bahumat kii unke paas kami nahin centre main bhi bharpoor or rajya main bhi bharpoor bahumat
 That is, now no excuse will run in front of the public
 avaidh boojadkhaanon ko band karne, anti romeo sowod banane ke vaade ko yogi pehle hafte main puraa kar chuke hai
 But for this they are also facing opposition
 teen talaak ke maamle ko bhi bijepi netaa ore khud yogi adityanath pramukhataa se uthaate rahe hai
 Everyone will keep an eye on what to do now
 iske saath ram mandir mudde ke samaadhaan kii ore badhane or out of court setlement ke liye supreme court kii tippanee ke baad isapar jald kaam karne kii chunauti bhi yogi sarkaar ke saamne hai
