 2010 main hue bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan nitish kumaar ne narendra modi ko bihar main prachaar ke liye aane se roak diya tha
 Apart from this, he has always raised his voice against Modi's candidature for the post of Prime Minister

 ham baat kar rahe hai 'da great bruce lee' kii
 Bruce Lee, known as the king of martial arts, is known for his action-packed films and martial arts
 vahiin jab bhi unke bare main socho to ek hi aise shaks kii chhavi saamne aa jaati he jisamen bijli jaisi furti he

 bruce lee kii teji aam insaan se kahin zyada tej thi
 The pace of his kick was so fast that he had to slow down a shoot 34 frames during the shooting of a film
 taaki darshakon ko ye mahasoos naa ho ki vah nakli acting kar rahe hai
 Because it was not possible for a common man to kick / kick so fast
 jaaniye, kiske naam par rakhaa gaya Mount Everest kaa naam5
 Everyone has an idol
 aise hi bruce lee gamma pahalwaan ke bahut bade fain the
 By the way, Lee was also a fan of boxer Mohammad Ali and his dream was to fight with him once
 6
 The amazing thing is that Bruce Lee started learning martial arts to fight miscreants
 phir kya uske baad se unhone peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 7
 jahaan lee marshall art king se aaj tak mashhoor hai
 At the same time, he was also known as a good cha-cha dancer

 But there is one Bruce Lee who used to make a hole in a steel coca-cola can
 aapako bataa de kii us samay yah can aaj ke aluminium can se adhik mote steel se banati thi
 10
 vaise to bruce lee kii sari hi filmein jabardast kii thim
 He had acted in more than 20 films at the age of just 18
 unki khaas filmon ke namsethhe Good And The obvious,the Big boss,fist Of fury,way Of dragon,enter The Dragon

 narsingh yadav rio olympic 74 kilo varg main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale the
 After failing in the dope test, wrestler 'narasimha Yadav said that he is innocent and the whole matter is a conspiracy against him', the Indian Wrestling Federation also alleged in it that Narasimha had a clean history and conspiracy
 
 narsingh ke khilaai hui sajeesh: kushti sanghabhartiya kushti mahasang ke sutron ne kaha ,‘ismensajishahui he
 Narasimha has a clear history
 uske khilaaf sajeesh hui he’ narsingh ke rio olympic jane kii ummid lagbhag khatm ho gai he
 Sushil Kumar will not be able to go to Rio
 Sushil Kumar will not be able to go to Rio Olympics
 sutara ne kaha,‘74 kilo varg main numaaindgi kaa faisla baad main liya jaayegaa
 But India will not be represented in the 74 kg category in Rio as the term of sending players 'names is over'
 pichley saal world championships main kaansya padak jeetne vaale narsingh kaa rio olympic ke liye chayan vivaadit halaat main hua tha kyonki olympic ke dohare padak vijeta susheel ne 74 kilo varg main daavedaari thoki thi
 Since Narasimha won the quota through the World Championship, both the WFI and the Delhi High Court rejected Sushil's demand
 narsingh ko haalanki iske liye lambii kanoonee ladaai ladani padi thi
 The demand for action against a complainant for alleged fraud of Rs 34 crore and a fake deal by three domestic women became a juggle of DLF and its top executives of the country's largest real estate company
 gauratlab he ki sebi ne company ke 2007 ke pratham saarvajanik nirgam (ipo) kii vivaran pustika main in saudon or inase jude jokhimon ko saarvajanik nahin kiya tha
 That is why the stock market regulator (SEBI), in an order published yesterday, prohibited six executives including DLF and its chairman and chief promoter DLF from entering into any buy and sell deal in the stock market for three years
 dlef ne ipo main 9,187
 5 crores was raised
 dlef kaa ipo us samay desh main sabase bada ipo tha
 The company says that it has not violated any rule law
 uskaa kahana he ki aadesh ke uchit nahin he or vah unke khilaaf apana bachaav karegi
 SEBI gave details of the entire development in the 43-page order
 iske anusaar dlef ke ipo ko lekar vyavsaayee kinshuk krishna sinha ne sebi main 4 june 2007 or 19 july 2008 ko do shikaayatein kii thim
 In the first complaint, he said that a company named Sudipti Estates Private Limited and some others had cheated him of 34 crores rupees in the matter of land purchase
 unhone is sambandh main sudipti or praveen kumaar va kuch anya ke khilaaf praathmiki bhi darj kii thi
 Sinha had also said that Sudipti had only two shareholders - DLF Home Developers Limited (DHDL) and DLF Estate Develop Limited (DEDL)
 donon companiyon dlef kii anushanbee hai
 Sinha said that both these companies are part of the DLF group
 apni duusari shikaayat main sinha ne kaha ki delf is baat se inkaar kar rahi he uskaa yaa uski anushangiyon kaa sudipti se koi sambandh he
 He claimed that dlf's lack of association with Sudipti was wrong
 sebi dwaara is sambandh main poochne par delf ne sambandh se inkaar kar diya
 Not satisfied with dlf's reply, Sinha filed a petition in the Delhi High Court which in April 2010 asked Sebi to investigate the matter
 sudipti or dlef kii yachika par vichaar karne ke baad ucch nyaayalay ne july 2011 main ek anya aadesh jari kiya or sebi ko is maamle kii jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Subsequently, SEBI ordered an inquiry into both complaints made by Sinha in 2007
 jaanch ke baad sebi ne delf ko june 2013 main dlef, chairman evam mukhya pravartak singh, unke putr rajeev singh, putree piya singh, or teen anya ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya tha, jinamein prabandh nideshak tisi goyal, tatkaaleen mukhya vitt adhikari ramesh sanka, tatkaaleen kaaryakari nideshak (vidhi) kameshwar swaroop or tatkaaleen gaiyr kaaryakari nideshak jies talwaar shaamil the
 Except Talwar, SEBI issued an order against six people and the company
 talwaar ko andeh kaa laabh diya gaya
 Chandrasekhar Azad, co-founder of Bhima Army, attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely in Aaj Tak's special program agenda
 unhone kaha ki unka makasad he ki vah bahujan movement ko itnaa majboot kar denge ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko waapas gujarat bhej denge
 He said that i am not doing politics, nor am i coming into politics
 lekin mere upar kai tarah ke aarope lag rahe hai, aarope to pradhanmantrinarendra modipar bhi lag rahe hai
 He said that PM Modi is facing allegations against Rafael
 ham puure desh main bahujan andolan ko itnaa majboot karenge ki 2019 main narendra modi ko waapas gujarat bhej denge
 Azad said that not only Dalits but 85 per cent of the people including OBC listens to him
 unhone kaha ki hamane bijanour, gujarat main muslimon ke saath baithak kii
 OBC society has also rallied, so it is not that we are talking about only one section
 unhone kaha ki ab main maharashtra ja rahaa hum, vahabhima koregaanjaaoongaa
 Some people are blocking me from going, but will still go
 ham lathi khaaenge, jail jaaenge lekin apni baat puri karavaaenge
 Azad said that he will not enter politics yet, but will go to every part of the country
 logon ko jaagruk karenge, taaki aane vaale andolan ke liye logon ko taiyaar kiya jaae
 He said that i will talk to parties like Tejashwi Yadav's party, Samajwadi Party, RLSP, Bahujan Samaj Party and strengthen them
 '25 lakh do to tumhaara baccha tumhen lautaa denge! 10 lakh do to tumhaare bachche kii haddiyaan tumhe mil jaaengi! ji haa
 
 
 a similar deal was going on in Ghaziabad
 yah sauda pehle daur ke liye chaar lakh rupee main tay hua lekin sauda karne vaale ne baccha jinda nahin lautaaya
 Later a deal was also made for the bones of the child but the accused was caught before the deal was done
 ghaziabad ke muradanagar ilaake main sthit bhopur gaanv main hue is vaakye ke tahat maasoom kaa kankal baraamad kar liya gaya he
 In fact, the innocent Vishal, a resident of Bhopur village, went missing from the house on 23 June
 iske baad kaaphi talash kii lekin uskaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 The next day, on 24 June, Vishal's father received a call for a ransom
 lekin, jab vishaal ke pita ne apni aarthik sthiti kamazor hone kaa hawala dekar kidanaper se baat kii to sauda chaar lakh main tay hua
 Vishal's father informed the Muradnagar police about this, but the police returned it without registering the report
 aise main kidanaper ko rakam dene ke alaava unke paas koi chaara nahin tha
 Meanwhile, the case was also reported to the Delhi Police
 dilli police ne ghaziabad police se sampark bhi saadhaa
 But the Ghaziabad police, adopting a lax attitude, did not register a case
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad 26 june ko maamla darj kiya gaya
 But no action was taken
 tippaniyan Kidnapper called again two days ago
 phone par usne kaha ki ab vishaal ke pita ko unka baccha jinda nahin mil saktaa
 One million rupees will have to be paid in lieu of his bones
 baat phir chaar lakh main tay hui lekin is bich police ne aropiyon ko hiraasat main le liya
 The accused have come into custody through surveillance and they have recovered Vishal's body from Bhopur village on Friday
 zaahir he agar police vakt rahete kaarywai karti to shaayad vishaal kii jaan batch sakati thi
 
 
 
 haalanki abhi tak is maamle main police khamosh he
 The deal was decided for the first round at four lakh rupees but the dealmaker did not return the child alive
 baad main bachche kii haddiyon ke liye bhi sauda kiya gaya lekin sauda hone se pehle hi aaropee pakad liya gaya
 The skeleton of the innocent has been recovered under this incident in Bhopur village located in Muradnagar area of ghaziabad
 darasal, bhopur gaanv kaa rahane vaala maasoom vishaal 23 june ko ghar ke paas se laapata ho gaya tha
 After this he searched a lot but nothing was found out
 iske baad agle din yani 24 june ko vishaal ke pita ke paas phiroti ke liye phone aayaa
 However, when Vishal's father talked to Kidnapper citing his financial condition being weak, the deal was fixed at four lakhs
 vishaal ke pita ne is baat kii soochna muradanagar police ko di lekin police ne report darj kiye bagaiyr hi unhen lautaa diya
 In such a situation, he had no choice but to give the money to Kidnapper
 is bich, dilli police ko bhi maamle kii soochna di gai
 Delhi Police also contacted Ghaziabad Police
 lekin dhulmul ravaiya apana rahi ghaziabad police ne maamla hi darj nahin kiya
 After considerable effort, the case was registered on 26 June
 lekin koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 The comments do din pehle kidanaper ne phir se phone kiya
 On the phone, he said that now Vishal's father cannot find his child alive
 uski haddiyon ke evaj main das lakh rupee dene honge
 The matter was decided again in four lakhs but in the meantime the police took the accused into custody
 servilans ke madhyam se aaropee hiraasat main aae hai or unhone shuukravaar ko bhopur gaanv se vishaal kii laash ko baraamad karvaa diya
 Obviously, Vishal's life could have been saved if the police had acted in time
 
 
 
 However, the police is still silent on the matter

 bhartiya janata party ne ambedanagar jile ke tanda kasbe main hindu yuva vahini ke netaa rambabu kii hatya kii sibiai jaanch karaaye jane kii maang or gajiabad main beeti raat party saansad yogi adityanath ko jabaran train se utaar liye jane ke virodh main vidhanbhavan ke saamne joardaar pradarshan kiya or uttar pradesh sarkaar kaa putala bhi foonka
 Addressing the protesters, the party's state president Laxmikant Vajpayee said that law and order in the state has collapsed and the morale of the rioters is on the seventh sky due to the government's policy of appeasement
 unhone tanda main rambabu kii hatya ke peeche sthaneey sapa vidhayak kaa haath hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki pradesh sarkaar ko is maamle kii bhi sibiai jaanch karwaani chaiye or sarkaar ko gupta ke ghar jaakar unke parijanon ko 25 lakh rupaye kaa muaavja dena chaiye
 Stating that the Samajwadi Party government had lost the moral right to continue in power, Vajpayee said that the way MP Yogi Adityanath was taken off the train at Ghaziabad railway station, it becomes a matter of breach of privilege and the officials responsible for it Action should be taken against notebandi ke mudde par ekajute hue vipaksh ne sansad main apana hangaamaa jari rakhaa or donon sadanon kii karrwai nahin chalane di
 Obviously, this situation suits the government as it is finding time to reduce the hassles of people engaged in ATM and bank lines

 isi ranneeti ke tahat krishi mantralay ne kisaanon ke liye beej or khaad kharidne ke liye puraane 500 ke note istemaal karne ko manjuuri de di
 Not only this, there is a plan to monitor cooperative banks in the next few days as most of the banks are associated with some political party in the states, in such a situation, the government is considering an action plan to stop their misuse
 is sabake bich vipaksh ke tevar deele padate najar nahin aa rahe
 It is possible that in both the houses of Parliament, there will be a ruckus on demonetisation, because both the government and the opposition are firm on their stand

 shikshakon ko bhi naksali paathyakram padhaanaa hoga varanaa ve bhi maut ke ghat utaar die jaaenge
 By looking at these books, you can get an idea of the kind of thinking and preparation with which Naxalism is planting crops
 apane dam kham vaale ilaakon main naksaliyon ne pehali kaksha se lekar paanchavi kaksha tak ke schuli bacchon ke liye naksali paathyakram lagu kiya he
 The government is surprised about the Naxalite courses, so the children of the schools whose buildings have been demolished by the Naxals have been shifted to other schools
 rajya ke skul shiksha mantri ke mutabik naksali bachapan se hi schuli bacchon ko naksalwad se jodne kii kavayad main jute hai
 On the other hand, a large population living in these areas is worried about the curriculum
 unhen nahin samaj main aa rahaa he ki apane gharon main rah kar unke bachche desh ke jimmedaar naagarik banenge yaa phir hathiyaar uthaa kar naksali
 Therefore, a large number of children have been shifted to city and district headquarters
 bastar ke andruni ilaakon ke schuli bacchon or shikshakon paranksli sahityaor paathyakramon kii bhi maar pad rahi he
 The teachers are afraid that if the disobedience of the Naxalites does not take their lives, then the school children are worried about what will happen to their future after living in these areas

 Premium charges apply !! bhartiya janata party main koi netaa anushaasan kii lakshmana rekha paar karne ke ghere main aata he to use party kii ore se 'kaaran bataao' notice jari kar jawaab maanga jaataa he
 If the answer is not satisfactory, the person concerned has to undergo disciplinary action
 haal hi main aisa bhopal se loksabhaa kii saansad sadhvi pragna thakur or indore se vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey ke saath hua
 Although the answer for both has come, it is not possible to have a meeting of the party's disciplinary committee
 darasal, sadhvi pragna ko 'kaaran bataao' notice kaa jawaab die hue dedh maheene se upar ho chuke hai
 At the same time, five days have passed since Akash Vijayvargiya also replied to the notice
 dilachasp ye he ki abhi tak bijepi kii anushaasan samiti kii koi baithak nahin hui he
 Due to no meeting, it is evident that it is not decided whether the committee is satisfied with the reply of Sadhvi Pragya and Akash Vijayvargiya
 yaa phir donon netaaon ke khilaaf aage kii karrwai ke liye samiti apni sanstuti kendriya netritv ko bhejegi yaa nahin
 Explain that the bjp's disciplinary committee has three members - Avinash Rai Khanna, Bijoy Chakraborty and Satyadev Singh
 beete kuch maheenon se is anushaasan samiti kii koi baithak nahin ho pai he
 What is the controversy related to Sadhvi Pragya: Pragya Pragya, during the Lok Sabha election campaign this year, issued a statement describing Nathuram Godse as a patriot, the BJP did not delay in issuing a 'show cause' notice to her
 sadhvi pragna ne 5 june 2019 ko party ke notice kaa jawaab bheja
 In it, she said that she will remain in discipline from the future and will meet Prime Minister Modi and also clear his point
 akaash vijayawargeey ko kyon mila tha noticepichley maheene bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ke bete akaash vijayawargeey ne indore main ek jarjar imaarat ko dhwast karne pahunche nagar nigam ke ek adhikari kii cricket bat se pitayee kar di thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed a tough stance after the incident caught fire
 modi ne bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main akaash vijayawargeey kaa naam liye bina kaha tha ki hamaari party main aavedan, nivedan phir de danaadan kii parampara nahin he
 The PM had also said, 'we do not need such an MLA, irrespective of the son of any one, even if one MLA is reduced, the party does not matter, which local leaders will welcome when that MLA comes out of jail
 They should also be removed from the party
 'is prakaran par bijepi ne 4 july ko akaash vijayawargeey ko 'kaaran bataao' notice diya
 He was given 15 days to respond to this notice
 pichley hafte hi akaash vijayawargeey ne notice kaa jawaab dete hue maafee maang lee thi
 Meanwhile, on Monday also Sadhvi Pragya was summoned by BL Santosh, BJP general secretary (organization)
 sadhvi pragna iske liye bijepi daftar pahunchi
 From another statement, Sadhvi Pragya has recently gone viral on the video of Sadhvi Pragya, in which she is seen saying that cleaning toilets or drains is not her job and she has not been selected for this
 naaliyon kii safai vaale bayaan par bhi party kii ore se sadhvi pragna se naaraazgi jataai gai or bhavishya main is tarah ke bayaan nahin dene kii hidaayat di gai
 At present, Sadhvi Pragya has already responded to the notice issued by the party on the statement that Nathuram Godse is described as a patriot, but due to the non-meeting of the party's discipline committee, the decision on him is hanging in the balance
 bijepi ke samvidhan ke anusaar, kisi bhi saansad or vidhayak par koi bhi karrwai karne kaa faisla lene kaa adhikaar sirf bijepi sansadeey board ke paas he
 According to sources, so far, the Discipline Committee has not sent any recommendations in the cases of Sadhvi Pragya and Akash Vijayvargiya
 sadhvi pragna or akaash vijayawargeey ne beshak noticeon kaa apane hisaab se jawaab de diya he
 Now the big question is whether the Disciplinary Committee will be satisfied with their answers or recommend any action
 sadhvi pragna or akaash vijayawargeey par anushaasan samiti kya rukh apanaati he, is par sabhi kii nigahen tiki hai, kyonki piem modi yun hi kisi par tippanee nahin karte hai

 Bihar Congress state vice president Brajesh Pandey is caught in a sexual harassment case of a Dalit girl
 dalit ladki koi or nahin balki ek congress ke hi netaa kii beti he
 The son of a former IAS is also involved in this sensational incident
 dhai maheene pehle ladki ne exiaar darj karai thi, lekin police haath par haath dhare baithi he
 However, Brajesh Pandey resigned from his post following the allegations
 peedit ladki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se guhaar laga chuki he
 The President has written letters to the Prime Minister and even the CBI, but there was no help from anywhere
 thak haar kar use media kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Accused Nikhil Priyadarshi is the son of a former IAS, his brother-in-law is SP in CBI
 uskaa dost bihar ke dijipi kaa betaa he
 The victim girl has not only been sexually abused by blackmail, but has also been tortured
 uskaa aarope he ki brajesh pandey or nikhil priyadarshi sex racket chalaate hai
 It also includes many influential politicians and bureaucrats from Bihar
 police ne is maamle main esaiti gathit kar jaanch shuru kii he, lekin abhi tak kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 The victim said that she got acquainted with Nikhil Priyadarshi through whatsapp and Facebook
 iske baad donon ke bich baatcheet hone lagi
 One day Nikhil sent him to Brajesh Pandey
 vah use unke boring road ek flats main le gaya tha
 There, the intoxicating substance in the cold drink was yellow
 iske baad usko koi hosh nahin tha
 He told that after he got drunk, Brajesh Pandey touched his private part
 usne iskaa baad virodh kiya, to nikhil or uskaa parivaar usko bahut marataa-pitataa tha
 Family members also included Nikhil's father and brother
 ve sabhisex racketchalaate he
 They were also pressurized to supply it
 peeditaka aarope he ki usne jab thane main shikaayat darj karai, to police ne aaropee ko hi sangrakshan diya
 The SHO was aware that Nikhil was leaving the airport, but told the ADG he did not order the arrest
 har koi uske paksh main he, isliye abhi tak koi karrwai nahin hui
 After this, he requested CM
 lekin jab shahrukh khan or rohit shetty jaise do masters ek saath aae hon, tab ummid kii jaati he kuch zyaada kii, kuch nae kii
 
 
 That means a lot of comedy and romance
 
 
 is film main kamedi or ection to he, lekin shahrukh khan ke hote hue bhi romance kii kami he
 
 
 On the other hand, there is no newness in the story of the film, because we have seen many times the story of a girl running away from a wedding without any choice, and how the hero saves her is also seen in the movies
 
 
 bas, nayaa kuch he to vah he south india se north india kaa milan
 
 
 Compared to the rest of Shah Rukh Khan's films, the music of 'chennai Express' is also simple
 
 
 so, 'chennai express' kaa safar haseen to he, lekin kuch nayaa nahin he, isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 3
 5 stars
 
 
 udhar, film kii kahani main bhi nayaapan nahin he, kyonki bina marzi ke karwaai ja rahi shaadi se bhaagti ladki kii kahani ham kai baar dekh chuke hai, or hero use kaise bachaata he, yah bhi hamane filmon main dekha he
 
 
 If anything is new, then it is the union of North India with South India
 
 
 shahrukh khan kii baaki filmon ke mukaable 'chennai express' kaa sangeet bhi saadhaaran he
 
 
 So, the journey of 'chennai Express' is beautiful, but nothing new, so my rating for this film is 3
 5 star

 It was so crowded that there would be difficulty in walking, we controlled all the crowds, took out all the boards and put our boards and made it a correct location by writing Urdu
 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko mili jeet ko abhi 6 maheene bhi nahin hue the ki loksabhaa chunaav main party ko karaari shikast jhelni padi he
 This is the reason why the churn continues in the party and the reasons for the defeat are being reviewed

 The Congress party, which won 114 out of 230 seats in the state assembly elections, won only one of the 29 seats in the Lok Sabha elections held six months later

 The more seats the BJP talks about before winning, the more it gets, so there is a possibility of disturbances
 congress ke sutron kii maane to madhya pradesh main kamalnath kii sarkaar aane ke baad kisaanon kaa do lakh tak kaa karj maaf kiya gaya, bijli bill ko aadha kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, many important decisions have been made which have tried to benefit the people of every section, even after that the Congress could not get results like assembly in Lok Sabha elections
 congress party ne 29 main se 15 siton kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 Why the results did not conform to the party and the government has remained a puzzle that the party has started brainstorming to solve
 rajasthan kii purv mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kii suraaj sankalp raily ke jaipur pahunchane par hui bijepi kii raily main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi bole ki congress ke khilaaf hawa chal rahi he

 narendra modi ne kaha ki vasundhara ji bataa rahi thim ki rajasthan ke siem ashok gahalot gali gali main ghumkar kah rahe hai ki main to seva ke liye satta kaa kadava ghunt jehar samaj pi rahaa hum
 PM also says that everything is like poison
 mujhe samaj nahin aata ki ye congress vaale jo khud desh ko karpshan kaa jehar pilaa rahe hai
 Why talk of poison all the time
 shaayad karpshan ko bachaane ke liye aisa karte honge

 Then he said that millions of people have come here to listen
 rajasthan kii pidaa, desh kaa dard sunne aae hai
 Does not suit you aap jaanate hai ki aap kitna nuksaan kar rahe hai
 Once again, Modi's slogan intensified, then Modi stood up with folded hands
 phir shor kuch thama to bhaashan aage badha
 Congress Nemodi changed the country's ABCD, mentioned the Corruption Alphabet on Facebook
 unhone kaha ki ab bachche si for cat nahin karpshan,kolgate or congress padhate hai
 According to Modi corruption is like a jewel for the Congress
 najarana he unke liye yah
 He also said that PM returned from G20, but did not tell the country what he said there
 kuch kaha bhi yaa nahin
 One medicine of everything: Narendra Modi said that there is only one medicine in the country that is deteriorating
 congress kii chuttee kar do
 Giving a touch of localism, he said that apart from Gujaratis in this country, there are only Marwaris who understand the real value of money

 The rupee is in the midst of a death
 modi ne kaha ki congress kii do hi chintaa he

 modi ne kaha ki mujhe pataa chalaa he ki rajasthan kii rajyapal margaret alva ji bhi is haive kii buree haalat ko dekhte hue kahati hai ki is par janaa munasib nahin
 Voters are to be a big celebration of youth 40% of Rajasthan voters are under 30 years of age
 is tathy par dhyaan dilaate hue modi ne kaha ki hamaare bacchon kii jab shaadi hoti he, to parivaar main utsav manaaya jaataa he
 But when he gets the right to vote, when he gets the precious gift of the Constitution of India, then this festival is not celebrated
 modi ne kaha ki main rajasthan kii dharti se puure desh ke yuvaaon ko sandesh dena chahta hum ki 18 saal kii umr main voter banane ke baad aap bharat bhagya vidhaataa ban jate hai

 pump ke kisse se khatm kii apni batcongress ko ukhaad phenkane kii baat karte hue modi bole ki jahaan jaao, sab baat karte hai ki puure desh main congress ko ukhaad phenkane kii aandhi chal rahi he
 He then explained that if we assume that the storm to remove the Congress is going at a speed of 200 km
 tab bhi kya isse saaikal ke tub main hawa bharegi
 He asked the public for his answer
 phir ek cheekhti hui na sunne ke baad muskuraate hue bole, agar haath main pump ho to hawa bhar jaaegi
 Booth's worker is that pump
 bijepi kaa kaaryakarta pump kii tarah kaam karegaa, logon ko khinchakar laaegaa, tabhi matpeti bharegi
 Rajnath heard the story of the old man mocked by the PM At the bjp's Suraj Sankalp rally, the national president of the party, Rajnath Singh, told an anecdote on the PM after describing Vasundhara Raje as the future Chief Minister of Rajasthan

 She reached out to Dr
 Manmohan Singh

 PM said, take five lakhs for treatment
 budhiya ne inkaar kar diya
 PM raised the amount to 10 lakhs

 The PM asked

 Hand over files, they also disappear

 Varsha Dongre, an assistant jailer who exposed the exploitation of tribals in the forests of Bastar, has lost her job
 khabaron ke mutabik varsha dongare ko raipur kii central jail main dipti-jailer ke ohade se nilambit kar diya gaya he
 He wrote a Facebook post after the Sukma Naxalite attack
 post main aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki chhattisgarh main naksali samasya ke peeche adivaasiyon kii jameen puunjipatiyon ko saunpane kii sajeesh he
 According to Dongre, innocent people are being tortured for this by innocent people
 haalanki dongare ke nilamban kii vajah is fasebuk post ko nahin bataaya gaya he
 What is the reason for the suspension? When Dongre's post jumped in the media, DG Jail issued a notice to him
 iske baad dongare ne swasthya kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue chuttee le lee thi
 According to the police administration, Varsha was sent an email notifying the holiday
 iske baavjood wo duty par waapas nahin lautin
 This is a violation of Section 207 of the Prison Manual

 At the same time, the government had claimed to give onion to the people at the rate of mandi, while the best type of onion was also not sold for Rs 50 per kg
 thok mandi main pyaaj kii keemat 41 rupye kilo ke aasapaas bani hui he
 Now BJP and Aam Aadmi Party have also come into the fray against government claims of cheap onions
 donon partiyon ne bhi kai ilaakon main 30 se 40 rupye kilo pyaaj bechney kii muhim shuru kii he
 The BJP alleges that the Congress government of Delhi is making profits in the name of relief

 Guruji, from Ganesh Gaitonde: “


 the one who is the most beloved, the sacrifice is the same

 If not the story, then not the Puranas and if not the Puranas then there is no God either

 isi shabd ke bharose lakhon phans ummid lagaae baithe the secred games 2 kaa
 As the entire nation was preparing to celebrate independence, some fans were waiting for Netflix's series Sacred Games 2 in the dark of night
 14 agast 1947 kii raat 12 baje pandit jawahar laal nehru ne bharat kii azaadi kaa elaan kiya to desh main ummiden jagin, 14 agast 2019 kii raat 12 baje netflix khulaa to ek hi sawaal kaa jawaab chahie tha
 Is this world worth saving? Regrettably this question sacrificed the hopes of millions of fans, the hopes that Sacred Games 1 had raised and the second season broke
 to iskaa gunahagaar koun he? duusare sijan kaa villen koun he? kahani main dikhaae gaye guruji, sarvashaktishaalee bhagwaan ganesh gayatonde yaa phir is series ke diarector anuraag kashyap / niraj ghevaan
 1
 sijan 2 main dikhaae gaye villen: gurujeepankaj treepathi un abhinaytaon main shaamil hai, jinhone pichley kuch saal main kaaphi fame kamaaya he
 On the basis of his character, acting, he wins the hearts of the critics as well as the audience
 unka nibhaayaa guruji kaa kirdaar is sijan kaa asli villen he
 Who is creating the whole story and making all the characters including Ganesh Gaitonde at his behest
 dhyaan or sex kii sikh dene vaale guruji mumbai ko khatm karne kaa mantra bhi dete hai or duniya main newclear kii jang karvaa ek nayaa sansar rachana chaahate hai
 The end of the Kali Yuga and the beginning of the Satyuga
 guruji ke kirdaar main pankaj treepathi bilkul feet hai, chehre par shanti or dhimi aawaaj ke saath guruji ke kirdaar main bhi dhal gaye or apni adaakaari se villen vaala khel bhi khel gaye
 According to the story, Pankaj Tripathi left no stone unturned in the character of Villain
 baaki to wo kah hi chuke hai, ‘newclear se aae hai
 
 
 And will end at the nuclear itself '
 2
 Villain of the story: Ganesh Gaitondenwajuddin Siddiqui still sees his fans in the role of Faisal, this is his strength and this is his weakness
 pehle sijan main ganesh gayatonde sachmuch bhagwaan lagane laga tha, navazuddin ne us kirdaar ko jiya tha jo baar-baar pehla sijan dekhne ke baad screen par dikhaai padataa tha
 Lord Ganesh Gaitonde, the omnipotent Lord of Kailashpada
 lekin duusare sijan main ye sab gujara jamaana laga
 Because Guruji turned out to be the real villain of the story, but for the character of Ganesh Gaitonde, Nawaz proved to be the villain in many places
 agar dhyaan se doosraa sijan dekhen to kai pal aise dikhenge jahaan navazuddin ek saadhaaran abhinayta ke taur par najar aa rahe hai
 His character was shown to be weak, that is different but Nawazuddin weakened that character many times by acting
 jab tak ganesh gayatonde kenya main rahaa, tabatak uskaa kirdaar or adaakaari donon hi kamjor rahe

 secred games 2 kaa asli villen: anuraag kashyamnurag kashyap wo diarector hai jinhone bollywood main baghawat kii, yani li se hatakar unhone kuch aisa kar dikhaaya jo koi nahin kar saktaa tha
 In a low budget, Gangs of Wasseypur was formed, which became history and entered into every household
 filmi duniya ke yuva student ke liye gangs of vasepur ek chapter he or anuraag kashyap uske professor
 When the first season of the Sacred Games came, Anurag Kashyap did it organically, because the world would see his power
 lekin duusare sijan main puraa khel hi bighad gaya
 The game deteriorated from the first episode of the second season to its final part
 kami kahani main bhi dikhi, kami sikvence main bhi dikhi or shaayad diarector sahib vahaan bhi chuke jahaan unhen do kahaniyon kaa saath chalaanaa tha, pehali sartaaj singh kii kahani jo vartmaan tha or duusari ganesh gayatonde kii jo bhoot kaal tha
 At the same time, the story became very mythical, it reached the nucleus and then kalyug-satyug, it could not be known
 8 ghante kii timeline main kabhi to aise laga ki ek dashak sirf 5 minute main khatm kar diya gaya ho, jabaki ek online siries main film jaisi pabandi nahin rahati
 Well, the expectations of the audience were very high, Netflix also felt like there would be a blast and perhaps Anurag Kashyap himself would have expected a lot from himself
 pehle sijan main jo dhamaakaa ‘kukku ke jaadu’, ‘bhagwaan ko maanate ho’ yaa phir ‘atapi-vatapi’ kii jodi ne kiya or wo aam insaan main ghus gaye wo duusare sijan main kalyug-satyuga ke chakkar, newclear ke dhamaake, bharat-pakistan-north korea-south korea ke formule nahin kar paae
 Now once again, perhaps waiting for a year in the audience's destiny is written to answer the question which was earlier this year
 ‘kya ye duniya bachaane laayak he?’ ‘agar he to kya ye shahar batch paaegaa?’ant main sirf vahi baat jo guruji ne ganesh gayatonde se marane se pehle kahi thi or gayatonde use doharaata hi rah gaya

 There was a smile on his face and after a short stay he left for his hometown of Rampur
 sandesh saaf tha
 Azam Khan did not attend the Samajwadi Party (SP) national executive meeting in Agra starting September 11 after the last eight cabinet meetings due to resentment
 is par jab mulaayam ke bhai or sapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ke saath varisht netaa naresh agarwal ne un par kade hamale kiye, to party supremeo mulaayam singh yadav fouran unke bachaav main yah kehete hue saamne aa gaye ki ajam kabhi sapa se naaraaz nahin ho sakate
 On September 13, Mulayam Singh sent Akhilesh Yadav to Azam and made the party leaders realize his importance again
 pichley ek maah ke dauraan yah doosraa mauka tha jab mulaayam ne ajam ko khaas tavajjo dene kaa sandesh diya
 On August 17, when Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders held a meeting with Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh Yadav in connection with starting the Chaurasi Kosi Yatra, Azam questioned the meeting of the top party leaders with the VHP
 unke is kade tevar ke 24 ghante ke bheetar hi pradesh sarkaar ne 25 agast se prastaavit churaasi kosi yatra par pratibandh laga diya
 After all, what are the reasons for which Azam has become sp's helplessness and Mulayam Singh ignores other leaders of his party and appears with him on every occasion
 soobe kii sapa sarkaar main teen muslim cabinet mantri or saat rajyamantri hai lekin jalawaa sirf ajam kaa hi he
 Knowledgeable in Muslim affairs and former Head of Department of Persian Department at Lucknow University, Prof
 khan aatif bataate hai ki sapa ke muslim netaaon main ajam iklaute netaa hai jo kareeb 30 varsh se mulaayam singh se jude hue hai
 He explains, "although the leader of Muslims in UP is Mulayam Singh, but he also needs a face that can act as a" link "between his party and the Muslims
 saharanpur se lekar sonbhadra tak ajam kii pahchaan he
 They are also the most experienced
 yahi vajah he ki mulaayam or ajam ek-duusare ke poorak bane hue hai
 After being formed by the SP government in March last year, he wanted to make Mulayam Singh Azam's experience as the Speaker of the UP Legislative Assembly but he did not agree to it
 ajam ke inkaar ke baad mulaayam ne unhen sansadeey kaary, nagar vikaas or alpsankhyak kalyaan jaise vibhaagon kaa cabinet mantri banaakar akhilesh sarkaar main number-tu kii haisiyat de di
 Azam's importance in the party was clearly seen at the inauguration of Johar University in Rampur on September 18 last year
 mulaayam singh, akhilesh yadav or 45 mantriyon kii maujuudagi yah bataane ke liye kaaphi thi ki maujuuda sarkaar ke liye yah kaarykram kitna ahm he
 of the sp's Legislative Council from the western districts, says that Azam's most need for the party is within the House
 unke mutabik, ‘‘ajam khan jab sadan main apni baat rakhte hai to unka ek khaas andaaj hota he
 His style of sarcasm on the opposition is also different
 dhardaar shabdon or jumalon se las unke tir thik nishane ko bedate hai or yahi andaaj ajam or samaajawaadee party ko phayda pahunchaata he
 "due to this specialty, Azam remains the government's governor within the House
" ajam ne sansadeey kaarymantri ke bataur isi varsh march main pratapgarh ke kunda main dipti espi jiyaul haq samet teen logon kii hatya ke baad acroshit vipaksh kaa majbootee se saamana kar apana loha manvaaya tha or iske baad mukhyamantri ke saath jiyaul haq or mrit pradhan nanhe yadav ke ghar pahunchakar soobe se achaanak paidaa hue siyaasi tufaan ko tham liya tha
 Azam's eloquence and special style of speaking distinguishes him from other leaders
 sapa main unase acha vaktaa doosraa nahin he
 For this reason, the media also keeps a close watch on Azam
 ajam ke baat-baat par naaraaz hone ko rajnatik vishleshak unki sochi-samajhi ranneeti maanate hai
 Head of Sanskrit Department at Badri Vishal Degree College, Farrukhabad, Dr
 ramakant tiwari bataate hai, ‘‘asal main sapa yah nahin chaahati ki ajam kuch aisa kar baithen jisase party ke ‘‘lakshya-2014’’ ko lekar desh ke siyaasi halkon main khaas taur par muslim or dharmanirpeksh takaton ke bich ulataa-sidhaa yaa samasya khadaa karne vaala sandesh jaae
 '' Close to Azam and Associate Professor at Raza Degree College, Rampur, Dr
 asalam khan bataate hai, ‘‘ajam apni baton ko bagaiyr kisi laag-lapet ke kehete hai isiilie duusare logon ko ve kadavi lagati hai
 "even though the leaders of politics were seen since childhood, Azam Khan has the number two position in the cabinet of the largest state of the country, but the politics tricks were seen in him from his childhood
 unke pita mohammad mumtaj khan ausat aarthik haisiyat vaale parivaar se the
 Azam, the second of two brothers and four sisters, was studying eleventh from Sunderlal Inter College in Rampur in 1966
 us vakt ‘‘angreji hataao movement’’ chalaa tha
 In Rampur, students under the leadership of Azam demonstrated fiercely
 police karrwai, lathicharge hua
 An arrest warrant was also issued against Azam
 lekin baad main police prashasan ne unhen bari kar diya
 After passing the intermediate examination in 1968, Azam went to study Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)
 vahaan kii chaatr raajnneeti main unke rajnatik kaushal ko badaae kaa bharpoor mauka mila
 He actively participated in the movement for the restoration of minority status to AMU and due to this he went to jail many times
 bie (onors) or elelbi kii padhai puri karne ke baad unhone ellem main pravesh liya
 Azam was elected Secretary of AMU Students Union in 1975 while still a LLM student
 isi dauraan desh main immergency lag gai
 Azam Khan also had to go to Aligarh Jail in Emergency
 isi dauraan un par ‘‘misa’’ bhi taamil hua or unhen banaras jail bhej diya gaya
 On returning to Aligarh from jail after a quarter of a year, Azam Khan received a tremendous reception in AMU
 ellem puraa karne ke baad ajam ne chaatr jivan chhodkar sakriy raajnneeti main pravesh karne kaa man banaaya
 But he had to face failure in the first innings of politics
 ajam khan ne 1977 main pehali baar muslim majalis party ke samarthan se rampur (sadar) vidhansabha se chunaav ladaa lekin haar gaye
 Impressed by former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, Azam joined his party Janata Party (charan Singh)
 1980 main isi party ke tikat par pehali baar rampur (sadar) vidhansabha seat se vidhayak chune gaye
 Four years later Charan Singh formed the Lok Dal and Azam also joined it
 1985 main ve duusari baar vidhayak bane
 Azam says, "in 1985, i first came in contact with Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav)
 us vakt main vidhayak tha or netaa ji vidhaan parishad main the
 His nature had a big impact on me
 ’’ 29 may, 1987 ko choudhary charan singh kii mrityu ke baad unki party lokdal do bhaagon lokdal (e) or lokdal (bi) main bant gai
 Azam joined Lokdal (B) along with Mulayam Singh
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘jab party do bhaagon main bant rahi thi tab netaa ji ne mujhase poocha ki kya aap meraa saath denge
 i immediately came unconditionally with him
 iske baad netaa ji ke saath mere paariwarik rishte ban gaye
 Netaji and i may not be partners of happiness, but we are definitely partners of suffering
 ’’ajam khan 4 aktubar, 1992 ko gathit hui samaajawaadee party ke sansthaapak sadasyon main se hai
 Azam, a seven-time MLA, was a cabinet minister in the Mulayam Singh government in 1989, 1993 and 2003
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan sapa ke tatkaaleen rashtriya mahasachiv amar singh se vivaad ke chalate unhen 21 may, 2009 ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 On 4 December 2010, Amar Singh returned to his party after leaving the SP
 iske baad se ajam sapa supremeo ke sabase najdiki party sadasyon main se hai
 Azam Khan's entry into Muslim politics began in 1980 when there were riots in Moradabad
 vipakshi vidhayak rahete hue ajam danga peediton ko raahat saamagree pahunchane ke liye muradabad ravaanaa hue lekin tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya
 Azam then strongly raised the issue in the assembly
 is puure prakaran main ve pehali baar akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main aae
 In 1985, in protest against the decision of the Supreme Court in the Shahbano case, the "muslim Personal Law Board" decided to start a demonstration, then joined Azam as a member of the "protection of Sharia Committee" in UP
 unke puraane saathi or vartmaan main pradesh ke apper mahadhivaktaa jafarayab jilani bataate hai ki sakriy raajnneeti main kudane ke baad se hi ajam muslim maamalon ke ek bade pairokaar ke rup main ubhar kar saamne aae the
 In response to the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi lock in Ayodhya on February 1, 1986, on 6 February 1986, a meeting was held in the house allotted to Azam Khan in b Block of Darul Shafa, Lucknow, in which the formation of "babri Masjid Action Committee" The decision was taken
 ajam or jilani sanyukt rup se is cameti ke sanyojak bane
 On becoming the first Chief Minister in 1989, Mulayam Singh replaced Azam as a cabinet minister in his government
 us vakt bhi ajam ‘‘babari masjid acshan cameti’’ ke sanyojak the
 The then Prime Minister V
 pi
 Many big leaders, including Singh, were pressurizing Azam to leave the post of convenor of the Action Committee after joining the government, but Mulayam did not let anyone run
 yahi vah daur tha jab ajam muslim raajnneeti kaa ek mukhya cheharaa banakar ubhare
 Whenever Mulayam felt the need of a partner on Muslim issues, Azam was seen standing
 haalanki sampradayikta ke muddon par unhone mulaayam kii aalochana bhi kii
 Azam was the most opposed to Mulayam's proximity to former BJP chief minister Kalyan Singh during the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 magar party se baahar hone ke baad unhone congress yaa bispi kaa daaman nahin thama balki rajnatik vanvaas main chale gaye or jaldi hi sapa netritv ko unki kami kaa ehsaas ho gaya
 19 of sp's Muslim Chehrarajya population
 33 fisadi musalmaan hai or 21 jilon main unki taadaad 25 fisadi se zyada he, jinamein zyaadaatar pashchimi uttar pradesh main hai
 The situation is that if ever a green state is formed, then there will be more chances of becoming Muslim Chief Minister Apart from this, in many Lok Sabha constituencies of the state, Muslim voters decide to win and lose
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki 2009 ke aam chunaav main ajam sapa kii kalyaan singh se badhati nazdikiyon se naaraaz the tab party 22 siton par simat gai
 The seats of large Muslim voters like Moradabad, Sambhal, Badaun, Bahraich, Saharanpur, Firozabad, Muzaffarnagar, etc
, came out of the sp's hands
 mulaayam singh ko ajam kii ahmiyat kaa andaja lag gaya or phir donon khushi ke aansu bahaate hue gale mili
 This resulted in last year's assembly elections
 ajam kehete hai, ‘‘agar maine 2009 main kalyaan singh ke sapa main shaamil hone par baghawat na kii hoti to kya samaajawaadee andolan majboot hota? kya sapa purna bahumat se satta main aati?’’sapa ke bahumat hasil karne ke baad bhi mulaayam or ajam main matbhed hue
 The two differed on the issue of making Akhilesh the chief minister, appeasing Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid, and allowing the vhp's Chaurasi Kosi Parikrama
 lekin mulaayam ne akhilesh kaa naam mukhyamantri ke rup main prastaavit karne ke liye unhen manaa liya; bukhari or unke damaad umr ali khan se duuri bana lee; or viechpi kii parikrama ko ijaajat dete se inkaar kar diya
 On the other hand, Azam is accused that he does not want any other Muslim leader in the party to emerge
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke ek mantri apni bebasii ke bare main kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar main hamaari haisiyat palledaar jaisi he
 "but a Muslim leader rejects Azam's hold on Muslims
" unke mutabik 2012 ke chunaav main ajam ne apane nau logon ko tikat dilvaaya tha, jinamein se sirf teen hi jeet sake
 Not only this, only Azam could win the elections in the five assembly seats of Muslim majority Rampur
 muslim raajnneeti main paith kii hode ne ajam ko virdohi netaaon ke nishane par laa khadaa kiya he
 Even though the SP government's plan to provide motor-driven rickshaws to the changing people of Rampur has not yet come out of the usage stage, most motor-driven rickshaws in Rampur

" ’’ jaahir he ki apni kaabiliyat ke saath-saath ajam kaa vivaadon se gaharaa naata he
 a deep connection to controversies Azam has been in the news for his alleged role from the Moradabad riots of 1980 to the recent Muzaffarnagar riots
 lekin inase unke muslimon ke pairokaar hone kaa sanket jaataa he, jo ajam ke rajnatik kariyar or sapa ke liye sahi he
 In the sting operation of Aaj Tak and Headlines Today on September 17, state police officials admitted that Azam had ordered not to be stern with Muslim rioters
 (dekheh vot ke dangon main mara voter)
 But Azam refutes the charge, saying, "these kinds of things are not in my nature
" is tarah kii jindagi jeene se main maranaa pasand karuunga
 "they are ready to conduct any kind of investigation into the matter
" baharhaal, mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav agle saal aam chunaav ke maddenjar ajam khan ko nazarandaaj karne kaa jokhim nahin mol sakate
 Muslim votes are necessary for the success of SP and only Azam is considered honest and stubborn in the interests of the community
 sapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ‘‘sapa main 42 muslim vidhayak hai

 Before that, reports of the film's performance being banned in some states are also coming out

 soshal media par logon ko sarkari yojanaon ke tahat banti jane vaali free chizon kii baadh ai hui he
 Following the claims of distribution of free laptops and smart phones, such messages are being shared on social media that on 15 August 2018, free helmets will be distributed under the Prime Minister's Road Safety Scheme and free bicycles under the Pradhan Mantri Cycle Scheme
 soshal media par muft helmet, muft cycle baante jane sambandhi massej beshak logon ko khush karne vaale hon
 But are the central government really preparing to distribute helmet-cycles on August 15, under the schemes named after the Prime Minister? The name of the government scheme is also mentioned on the website link given in the viral message, along with the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aakhir kya he sachai? india today fact check team ne is tarah ke massej kii padtaal kaa faisla kiya
 Following the huge success of # Helmet, the "free Cycle Distribution Scheme" 😂😂pic
 twitter
 com / ifdpkedp7g— Narendra Dammy (@nkdammy) July 22, 2018 In a message spread through whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter, it is also claiming that free helmets and free bicycles are distributed to nearby government schools in the area on 15 August 2018
 Will go
 donon massej main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki inhen apane doston, rishtedaaron or grups main zyada se zyada share karen jisase ki sabhi chaatr-chatraayen iskaa laabh uthaa saken
 After further investigation, we came to know that both these websites are godaddy
 com ke tahat panjikrut hai
 http: / / helmet
 pm-yojna
 in which the organization whose name was in the registration of free helmet scheme was shocking
 yah naam tha "modi sarkaar karporation " or pataa- punjab ke naam par registerd tha
 Similarly http: / / bharat-sarkar
 co jis par free cycle yojana kaa massej viral hua tha uske registration main kisi kaa naam nahin tha bas pataa erizona, united state par registerd tha
 No more information
 jaahir he ki free cycle or free helmet baatane waalon kaa koi ata pataa kahin maujuud nahin
 Clicking both links opens a page
 pej main sabase upar pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tasviir, ashok chakra kii tasviir or phir cycle / helmet kii tasviir lagi hui he
 "prime Minister's Cycle Scheme 2018" and "prime Minister's Road Safety Scheme" are written just below these pictures
 cycle ke liye ek gulabi pattee par likhaa he ki free cycle paane ke liye apana naam, apane pita kaa naam, skool kaa naam, varg, apana pataa or apana rajya kaa naam darj karen
 Similarly, on a blue strip for the helmet it is written that to get a free helmet, enter your name, bike number, state name
 saath hi ye bhi ki driving license he yaa nahi darj karen
 Link to an advertisement right after this
 or phir form bharne ke baad register karne kaa batan
 We decided to fill the form to find out the truth
 phir baari baari se donon yojanaon ke farm bharen
 First of all, we filled the form of the alleged Prime Minister Cycle Scheme
 register ke batan ke ko dabaate hi baad massej aayaa ki hamaara aavedan unhen mil gaya he
 Complete the process below to confirm this application
 aavedan kii pushti kii prakriya ye thi ki massej ko watsap par 10 doston ke saath share karnaa padegaa
 After that click on the blue button and get your order number
 india today fact check team ne phir kathith pradhanmantri sadak suraksha yojana ke antargat free helmet paane ke form par bhi apana registreshan karavaaya
 In this too, on pressing the register button, the same earlier message came that they have received your application, complete the process given below to confirm the application
 phir apane 10 doston ko whatrup par share kare or apana order number praapt karen
 During the investigation, it was seen that if the link of the scheme was opened on mobile then it was necessary to share with 10 people on whatsapp
 lekin computer par link ko clic kiya to watsap par share kiye bina bhi aage badha ja saktaa he
 The last stop of the process was to click the button to get your order number
 jaise hi is batan ko clic kiya to pop -ap windo khulaa jisapar likhaa tha "dhanyavad aapkaa order safaltaapurvak praapt ho gaya he
 And your order number is 39SZ67AB3A1VM, please write it in a safe place "
 iske baad oke batan ko clic karte hi ek or pej khulaa jis par ek baar phir se pradhanmantri modi kii tasviir lagi hui thi or us par likhaa hua tha " dhanyavad aapkaa order praapt ho gaya he! aapkaa order number 39SZ67AB3A1VM he, kripaya ise kisi surakshit sthaan par likh len, sabhi cycle 15 agast 2018 ko najdiki sarkari vidhyalay main vitarit kiye jaaenge, us din apana order number apane paas rakhen
 "similarly, the same message was seen on the registration of helmets
 khayr, itani padtaal karte-karte donon hi prakriyaaon ke antim pej par nazar padi to is par do vigyaapan ke link the
 And it was written just below that 'modi / Govt
 ap downlod karke inastol karen
 Then there was the button to install Modi App / Government App
 saath hi likhaa tha ki "inastol kiye hue app kam se kam 7 din tak mobile main rakhen"
 But if you download this app, you will find that it is not a Modi app, an app named 'freebuzz', which is used for video sharing
 hamane or jaanch kii to pataa chalaa kii in donon website godaddy
 com
 http: / / helmet
 pm-yojna
 in jisamen free helmet yojana ke registration main jis sanghathan kaa naam tha vah chaukaaney vaala tha
 The name was "modi Sarkar Corporation" and the address was registered in the name of Punjab
 isi tarah http: / / bharat-sarkar
 Co, on which the message of the Free Cycle Scheme went viral, no one was named in the registration, just the address was registered in Arizona, United States
 iske alaava or jaankaree nahin
 It is clear that there is no sign of free bicycle and free helmet distributors
 15 agast ko free helmet or free cycle baantne kii kathith yojanaon ke bare main parivahan rajya mantri mansukh mandavia se jab poocha gaya to unhone is tarah kii kisi bhi yojana hone se inkaar kiya
 During the investigation, the terms and conditions given below the registration form were also shocking, which can be read on these links
 viral test se saaf hua ki free helmet yaa free cycle jaise sabhi massej farji hai
 Just such messages are being used to mislead people on social media platforms
 pej par aane vaale vigyapanon se in farzi website kaa makasad apni jeben bharna he
 Let me tell you that earlier messages like 'pradhan Mantri Free Laptop Scheme' and 'pradhan Mantri Free Smartphone Scheme' were spread on social media which proved to be fake
 farji massej main pradhanmantri modi kii tasviir or jis tarah yojanaon ko sarkari yojana kaa naam de kar logon ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa he, inke khilaaf sarkaar ko kade kadam uthaane chahie
 But people should also be aware of such misleading messages
 kisi bhi website / soshal media platform par pradhanmantri yaa kisi netaa kaa photo lagaakar us par koi bhi baat likh dene se wo vishwasaneey yaa sach nahin ho jaatin
 In such a situation, it is necessary to first examine the messages and the claims given in them
 viral test main yah khabar juthi nikali
 Under such a scheme of the Government of India, neither free helmets nor free cycles will be distributed
 personal technology ke kshetra main nirantar sudhaar or innovations tathaa online community badaae se samaaj kii nai paribhaasha ban gai he
 Along with this, the meaning of study and teaching is also changing
 soshal media website jaise fasebuk, twitor, linkdin, googleplus or pinterest logon ko jodgaye, jaankariyon kaa aadan-pradaan or sambandh banane ke liye protsaahit kar rahi hai
 But they also provide opportunities for people to search the internet in a directionless way, to make connections with people without any reason
 is tarah ke kaam se logon kaa seekhney kaa uddeshy puraa nahin hota he
 It cannot be denied that people have made these networks a part of life to create professional and personal relationships
 sabhi internet upabhoktaaon main kareeb 72 fisadi log soshal media par sakriy hai or inamen 18-29 saal ke yuvaaon kii sankhya 89 pratishat he
 Even the number of people in the 30-49 age group using social networking sites is 72 percent
 50-60 saal ke log bhi in cites kaa istemaal kar rahe hai or inaki sankhya kareeb 60 fisadi he
 Believe in comscore's global trends, between 2011-12, the time spent on youth social networking sites has increased by more than 62 percent (1 in 8 minutes in 13 minutes)
 is avadhi main zyada paaramparik internet ke istemaal main 50 karod ghanton kii kami ai he
 This shows that today's active web consumers or digital natives are demanding people who prefer to benefit from social networking sites
 yahaan tak ki shiksha shastri bhi ucch shiksha main soshal netwarking ke phaaydon par najar rakhane lage hai
 About 100 percent of the students of universities and colleges are spending most of their time on social networking sites
 yah adhyayan course kendrit hone ke saath-saath anaupchaarik bhi ho saktaa he, jisamen pehle se nirdhaarit kisi karikulam kii jarurat nahin hoti he or akasar seekhney vaale ke bheetar se hi nae vishay nikal aate hai, jaise students kaa koi samooh, jo aane vaale test ke liye yaa kuch nai rochak cheez seekhney ke liye ikattha hota he

 According to the New York Times, Peter Shane, CFO of HTC has said that even after this deal, HTC will have more than 2 thousand research and design staff

 pakistan kaa raksha vyay july-sitambar kii pehali timahi ke liye bajtiy seemaa ko paar kar gaya

 In 2014, when the BJP won 27 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh, people felt that this was an exception; But 2019 is proving that he was no exception
 isse pataa chalata he ki jab log centre main kisi sarvocch netaa ke naam par matdaan karte hai, to rajpariwaar ke netaa bhi haar sakate hai—guna main jyotiraditya sindhiya un ke
 P
 yadav se haare hai jo kabhi unke saansad pratinidhi hote the
 Since 1990, the voters of Madhya Pradesh have been upset about electing the party in the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 in arthon main dekhen to maatr paanch maheene pehle rajya main bhaajapa kaa 15 saal kaa shasankaal khatm karne vaali congress ko abhi aae parinaamon par aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 In 1998, BJP won 30 out of 40 seats of undivided Madhya Pradesh while Congress won 0 out of 10 seats
 iske kuch hi maheenon baad congress vidhansabha chunaav jeetne main safal rahi thi
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan became the Chief Minister for the second consecutive term in 2008 when the BJP won 143 out of 230 seats in the state and the Congress had a total of 71 seats
 iske kuch maheenon baad 2009 ke aam chunaav main congress ne 29 main se 12 loksabhaa siten jeetin
 Why the Congress could not perform in the Lok Sabha elections like assembly elections
 ek baat to yah ki kamalnath sarkaar ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye adarsh aachaar samhita lagu hone se pehle chunavi vaade puure karne ke liye keval dhai maheene kaa samay mila
 In this time also the government mainly focused on farm loan waiver
 usase bhi buree baat yah hui ki krishi rin maafiyon se koi chunavi phayda nahin paidaa hua
 It also seems to increase the reservation for other backward classes from 14 percent to 27 that could not excite the target group
 iske alaava, congress ke bade diggajon ke bich jo talmail vidhansabha chunaavon main dikhaa tha vah aam chunaav main dekhne ko nahin mila
 The bjp's landslide victory is not in the interest of the Congress government in the state as it rests very lightly on the majority
 rajya vidhansabha ke kul 230 main se 114 sadsy congress ke hai or use chaar nirdaleeyon, ek sapa vidhayak tathaa do basapa vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil he
 Other leaders, including BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, have also said that the state government will collapse after the elections
 vijayawargeey ne 19 may ko indore main kaha tha ki kamalnath ne rajya main 22 siten jeetne kaa daawa kiya tha, ab prashn to yah he ki kya vah agle 22 dinon tak mukhyamantri kii kursi par bane rahenge
 The next day on 20 May, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Gopal Bhargava wrote a letter to Governor Anandiben Patel, demanding a special session of the Assembly
 unhone india today se kaha, ''kisaan karj maafee par congress ne kuch spasht nahin kiya he
 Various claims are floating in the air
 vidhansabha ke satr main sab kuch spasht ho jayega
 Bhargava's demand was turned down but a session is to be called to pass the budget
 bhaajapa kii ore se ateet main bhi aise prayaason kaa itihaas hone ke kaaran sarkaar ko asthir kiye jane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The strength of the BJP in the Legislative Assembly has come down a bit due to the absence of MLA from GS Damore
 damor ratlam seat se chunaav jite hai
 The coming days are tough for Kamal Nath

 Overall, Anurag Kashyap plays a lot

 gurugram ke bhondsi ilaake main cricket match se paidaa hue vivaad ke baad bheed ne ek parivaar par hamalaa kar diya or uske sadasyon ko lathi, dandon or rohe kii rod se peeta
 The police had arrested six people so far
 ghatana kaa video bhi saamne aayaa tha, jisamen kuch logon parivaar ke purushon ko laathiyon se peetate hue dikh rahe the, vahiin parivaar kii mahilaayein ro rahi hai or unhen chhodane kii bheed se guzarish kar rahi thi
 ACP of Gurugram, Shamsher Singh had told that the incident happened at 5 pm on Thursday when the family members of the victim were playing cricket outside their house in Bhup Singh Nagar
 yah parivaar alpsankhyak samudaay se taalluk rakhata he
 Police said the family of three-four people were allegedly attacked by a mob of around 40 in Bhondsi area
 police adhikari ne bataaya tha ki parivaar ke ek sadsy sajid ko us vakt tak dandon or lohe kii rod se peeta gaya, jab tak vah behosh na ho gaya
 Sajid told that six-seven people, who had drunk alcohol, prohibited him from playing cricket in the street
 jab parivaar ke logon ne cricket khelnaa jari rakhaa to kareeb 40 se zyada log vahaan ikattha ho gaye or unhone parivaar par hamalaa kar diya
 i am Girindra
 do saal pehle tak dilli or kanpur main khabaron kii duniya main rama rahane vaala ek shaks, jiske liye khabar kii duniya hi roji roti thi, lekin uske bheetar apana ek gaanv tha, jisamen renu kii ek basti thi
 
 
 His was sloppy
 
 
 parati pariktha thi
 The same village took me away from the metropolitan life to my fallow land and journalist Girindra by profession reached Purnia district of Bihar
 apane gaam-ghar
 To do farming
 vahi purniya jila, jo in dinon tufaan kii tabaahi ke kaaran aap logon ke jehan main he
 Where Phanishwar Nath Renu used to say- Awaran Deve Patua, Pet Bharan Deve Paddy, Chadarva Tana of Basniya of Purnia
 
 
 yah sab ek jatke main nahin hua tha, iske peeche man se hamane paanch saal tak ladaai ladi
 Then i agreed to go back to the village
 ab to kisaani karte hue do saal ho gaye hai, matlab kul jamaa 730 din
 In these days of counting, we have seen a lot of ups and downs, but the year 2015 is examining the people doing harvest like me
 march ke ant main hamane bin mausam barish kaa tandav dekha
 Wheat and mustard crops were destroyed in front of the eyes, but on Tuesday, April 21, nature's attack broke our right back
 tufaan kii chapet main hamane sab kuch ganvaa diya
 The corn crop was damaged
 kehete hai ki purniya jile main ghasphoos ke ghar main rahane vaale kisaan makka kii fasal se pakkaa makaan kaa safar tay karte hai
 There is a lot of income from its cultivation, but no one gets ahead of time
 mangal kii raat aadhe ghante kaa tufaan ne hamaari jindagi ko ek aise mode par laa khadaa kar diya he, jiske aage ghupp andhera he
 Electricity is away from us for the last four days
 bijli jo roshni detii he, vah bhi hamase dur ho gai he
 Do not know how the mathematics of the harvest divides everything by doing subtraction
 ganit ke us sawaal kii tarah jisamen bhaag karte hue hamaare hisse main keval shunya hi naseeb hota he
 Maybe this is life
 kisaani karte hue hamane jivan kaa itnaa ulajhaa ganit nahin dekha tha
 Till yesterday, the field in which the young maize plant was fluttering on its youth, we saw it weeping in front of our eyes in the lap of the earth
 kheti karte hue hamane janaa ki har fasal hamaare liye santan he
 Paddy is like a daughter to me, then Mecca is my son, who gives me a year's worth of ration water
 us makke ko jab maine khet main ludhake dekha to man ke saare taar ek saath tut gaye
 When i used to do journalism in an air conditioned cabin office, we used to talk about the village countryside during lunch time
 aah graamy jivan! jaise jumale se gaanv ghar kii baaten karte the
 For us, the village was like a legend at that time, in which there is only happiness
 ham anchal kii saanskrithik smriti main hari doob kii talash kiya karte the, lekin jab kisaani karne dharti par utre to jaan gaya ki is dharti par kisaani hi ek aisa pesha he jahaan ham sau fisadi prakruti par nirbhar hote hai or yahaan sukh kii talash main dukh se roj milnajulana hota he
 We create wealth due to nature and we also see wealth flowing in water due to that
 gaam kii sulekha kaaki kaa angan mangal kii raat tabah ho gaya
 Bread was cooked in the courtyard stove at night, milk was boiled
 khaane ke baad sab jab sone gaye tabhi hawa kaa jor barish ke sang tabaahi kii patakatha likhakar aa chukaa tha or angan-ghar sab kuch udaate hue nikal gaya or chhod diya sulekha kaaki ko bas rone ke liye
 The Chief Minister of the state got out of the helicopter from above
 muaavja kii maukhik barish karte hue ve shant-chitt mudra main akhabaaron –channelon par avatarit hue lekin sulekha kaaki jaise logon kaa dukh baantne jameen par koi nahin aana chahta
 Alauddin Chacha of Gam says- “you do not even read farming while writing farming! Then you should know that elections are going to be held in the state
 ab to tufaan bhi siyaasi karne waalon ke liye vakt par aane laga he
 
 
 
 “ itnaa kehane ke baad chachcha kii ankhen bhar ain or ve mujhe apni bansbatti dikhaane lage jahaan bans ukhde pade hai
 
 
 While doing farming, we keep dreaming of a golden future
 fasal bechakar jivan kii gaadi ko or aage badhaane main lage rahete hai
 See, this time it was expected that the crop would be good, then Babuji would be taken to Delhi once again
 vahaan kisi anbhavi neuro sarjan se dikhaaenge
 With the hope that they should stand up again and explain to me that planting potatoes in such and such a field heats up paddy in the east
 babuji kii tabiyat ko lekar main khud ko ek bharam main rakhata aayaa hum is aashaa ke saath ki vah thik ho jaaenge
 For the past two years, the maize crop has been strengthening my illusion, but this time it also broke
 ye anubhav keval meraa nahin balki mere jaise sainkadon kisaanon kaa hoga, jisane is baar tufaan kii tabaahi ko bhoga he
 Last night i heard on the radio that during the Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, the issue of the devastation caused by the storm in the Parliament was overshadowed
 mere jaise kisaan kii guzarish bas itani he ki kisaani-mudde ko raajnneeti kii kitaab kaa cover pej na banaaya jaae
 Assistance was reached to the farmers of Purnia and the affected district
 us kisaan ke bare main dilli main baithe log sochane kii koshish karen, jinke ghar main matam failaa he, un gharon ke bare main sochen jahaan ki chat hawa main udakar kahin dur chali gai or bilakhte bachche dhoop main ro rahe hai
 i am seeing all this with my eyes
 camere kaa lens tasviren lene se manaa kar rahaa he
 The comments man ke bheetar baitha khud kaa sampadak dukh kii marketing karne se manaa kar rahaa he, vah kahata he shabdon ke jariye logon tak apni baaten pahunchaao
 The power of the word is such that it touches the heart
 man kii baat sunakar main saham jaataa hum or ek najar phir apane khet kii ore detaa hum or phir mudakar bichhaavan par lete babuji ko dekhne lagata hum
 i think that if they were alright, they would explain to me - "don't be afraid, fight
 kisaani karte hue ladanaa padataa he or phir ve kuch muhaavara sunaate or kehete ki jaao ghumo or tabaahi ke manjar ko mahasoos karo taaki tumhen apana dukh kam dikhne lage kyonki tumse bhi zyada kshati or logon kii hui he
 " kisaani karte hue khud kaa dukh main shabdon ke jariye bayaan karata hum
 The destruction of this time is pleasing to me
 tabaahi kaa aankada badhata hi ja rahaa he
 People who bake the bread of politics are also afraid of farming issues
 muaavja kaa bandarbaant hona abhi baaki he
 When the amount of compensation will reach the people or how much will be reached, it will also be a story
 ham sab us katha ke charitra honge, jise baad har koi hamen bhuulaa degaa
 But remember, we all grow wheat for bread, rice for rice and maize for your popcorn in multiplexes
 yadi ek aandhi hamen barabaad kar sakati he to yaad rakhie ek acha monsoon hamen banpar fasal bhi degaa
 we will not give up
 ham jaanate hai ki hamaare haath main keval beej bona he
 The destiny of the crop is in the hands of nature
 aandhi or barish kii maar se ham haar nahin maanenge
 We do not know when the government compensation will reach our bank-accounts, but we do know for sure that we have to work very hard for the next crop
 mausam kii maar sahane ke baad himmat jutakar phir se kheton main lag janaa he
 Not just for your own and family's stomachs, but also for the dining tables of all of you
 usee gaanv ne mujhe mahanagareey jivan se koson dur apni parati jameen kii ore le jane kaa kaam kiya or peshey se patrkaar girindra pahunch gaya suba bihar ke purniya jila
 Own home
 kheti baari karne
 The same Purnia district, which is in your mind these days due to the destruction of the storm
 jahaan ke bare main fanishwar nath renu kehete the- aavaran deve patua, pet bharan deve dhan, purniya ke basaiyya rahe chadarava taan
 
 
 All this did not happen in a jolt, we fought it out of mind for five years
 tab jaakar man raji hua, gaanv lautne ke liye
 Now it has been two years of farming, which means 730 days total deposits
 ginati ke in dinon main hamane dher saare utaar-chadhaav dekhe, lekin saal 2015 mere jaise kisaani kar rahe logon kii pariksha le rahaa he
 At the end of March, we saw an orgy of rain without rain
 genhu or sarson kii fasalon ko ankhon ke saamne tabah hote dekha, lekin pichley mangalvaar ko yani 21 april ko prakruti kii maar ne hamaari rahi sahi qamar bhi tod di
 We lost everything in the grip of the storm
 makka kii fasal chaupat ho gai
 It is said that farmers living in grass house in Purnia district travel to a pucca house with maize crop
 khub aamadani hoti he isaki kheti se, lekin vakt ke aage kisi kii nahin chalati he
 The half-hour storm on the night of Mars has brought our lives to a turning point, in front of which there is darkness
 pichley chaar dinon se bijli hamase dur he
 The light that lightning has given us is also far away from us
 pataa nahin kisaani kii kismat kaa ganit jod ghataav karte hue kaise sab kuch baant detaa he
 Like that mathematics question in which our division has only zero luck
 shaayad yahi jivan he
 While cultivating, we had not seen such a complicated math of life
 kal tak jis khet main makke kaa jawan paudha apni javaani par ithla rahaa tha, use hamane apni najaron ke aage dharti maiyaa ke god main rote bilakhte dekha
 While doing farming, we came to know that every crop is a child for us
 dhan mere liye beti kii tarah he to makka meraa betaa he, jo mujhe saal bhar kaa rashan pani detaa he
 When i saw that maize rolled in the field, all the strands of mind broke together
 jab main vaataanukoolit cabin vaale offis main patrakarita kiya karata tha to lunch time main ham gaanv dehaat kii baaten karte the
 Ah Rustic Life! For example, the village used to talk to Jumle
 hamaare liye gaanv us vakt ek aisi dantakatha kii tarah tha, jisamen keval sukh hi sukh hota he
 We used to search for green coach in the cultural memory of the region, but when the farmers came down to the ground, they knew that farming is one such profession on this earth where we are 100 percent dependent on nature and here in search of happiness, sadness Have to meet every day
 prakruti kii badaulat daulat banaate hai or usee kii badaulat daulat ko pani main behate bhi dekhte hai
 The courtyard of Gam's Sulekha Kaki was destroyed on Tuesday night
 angan ke chuulhe main raat main roti paki thi, doodh ublaa tha
 When everyone went to sleep after dinner, the force of the wind had come after writing the script of destruction with the rain and the courtyard and house went out blowing everything and left Sulekha Kaki just to cry
 soobe ke mukhyamantri helicopter se upar se dekhakar nikal liye
 He appeared on newspapers-channels in a calm-minded manner, giving a verbal rain of compensation, but nobody wants to come to the ground to share the grief of people like Sulekha Kaki
 gaam ke allaudin chachcha kehete hai-“ tum to kheti kisaani karte hue likhte padhate bhi ho na! tab to tumhen pataa hona chahie ki soobe main chunaav hone vaale hai
 Now even the storm has started coming on time for the political leaders
 
 
 
 "after saying this, Chacha's eyes filled up and he started showing me his bamboo where the bamboo is uprooted
 
 
 kisaani karte hue ham sunahare bhavishya kaa sapana dekhte rahete hai
 By selling the crop, they are engaged in furthering the car of life
 dekhie na, is baar ummid thi ki fasal acchhee hogi to babuji ko ek baar phir dilli le jaaenge
 Will show it to an experienced neuro surgeon there
 is aashaa ke saath ki ve phir khadey ho jaaen or mujhe samajhaayen ki falaan khet main aalu lagaana to purab ke khet main garma dhan
 i have kept myself in a dilemma about Babuji's health with the hope that he will recover
 pichley do saal se makka kii fasal mere us bharam ko majboot karata rahaa he, lekin is baar wo bharam bhi tut gaya
 This experience will not only be mine but hundreds of farmers like me, who have suffered the devastation of the storm this time
 kal raat radio par suna ki loksabhaa main shoonyakaal ke dauraan sansad main tufaan se hui tabaahi kaa mudda chaaya rahaa
 The request of a farmer like me is that the issue of farming should not be made the cover page of the book of politics
 purniya or prabhavit jile ke kisaanon tak sahaayta pahunche
 Try to think of the people sitting in Delhi about the farmer whose weeds have spread, think of those houses where the roof has blown away in the air and the crying children are crying in the sun
 yah sab ankhon se dekh rahaa hum
 The camera lens refuses to take pictures
 tippaniyan The editor sitting inside his mind is refusing to market the misery, he says, through words, convey your words to the people
 shabd kii takat aisi hoti he ki vah dil ko chhu letaa he
 After listening to my mind, i am scared and give one glance to my field and then turn and see Babuji lying on the bed
 sochataa hum ki yadi ve thik rahete to mujhe samajhaate- “daro mat, lado
 You have to fight while farming and then they would say some idiom and say go go and feel the scene of destruction so that you can see your suffering less because you have suffered more and more
 “ i express my grief through words as a farmer
 is baar kii tabaahi mujhe sukhar kar rahi he
 The figure of destruction continues to grow
 kisaani ke muddon se raajnneeti kii roti senkane vaale logon se dar bhi lag rahaa he
 Compensation is yet to be distributed
 logon tak muaavje kii raashi kab pahonchegi yaa kitni pahonchegi, ye bhi ek kahani hogi
 We will all be the characters in the story, which will be forgotten by us later
 lekin yaad rakhie, roti ke liye gehun , chaaval ke liye dhan or multiplex main aapke popcorn ke liye makka ham sab hi upjate hai
 If a thunderstorm can destroy us, remember that a good monsoon will also give us a bumper crop
 ham haar nahin maanenge
 We know that we only have to sow seeds in our hands
 fasal kii niyati prakruti ke haathon main hai
 We will not give up due to storm and rain
 sarkari muaavja hamaare bank-khaaton main kab pahonchega ye to hamen pataa nahin, lekin itnaa to jarur pataa he ki agali fasal ke liye hamen khub mehnat kerani he
 Having to bear the brunt of the weather, you have to muster up courage and re-enter the fields
 keval apane or parivaar ke pet ke liye nahin balki aap sabon ke dining teble ke liye bhi
 Now it has been two years of farming, which means 730 days total deposits

 dhan mere liye beti kii tarah he to makka meraa betaa he, jo mujhe saal bhar kaa rashan pani detaa he
 When i saw that maize rolled in the field, all the strands of mind broke together
 jab main vaataanukoolit cabin vaale offis main patrakarita kiya karata tha to lunch time main ham gaanv dehaat kii baaten karte the
 Ah Rustic Life! For example, the village used to talk to Jumle
 hamaare liye gaanv us vakt ek aisi dantakatha kii tarah tha, jisamen keval sukh hi sukh hota he
 We used to search for green coach in the cultural memory of the region, but when the farmers came down to the ground, they knew that farming is one such profession on this earth where we are 100 percent dependent on nature and here in search of happiness, sadness Have to meet every day
 prakruti kii badaulat daulat banaate hai or usee kii badaulat daulat ko pani main behate bhi dekhte hai
 The courtyard of Gam's Sulekha Kaki was destroyed on Tuesday night
 angan ke chuulhe main raat main roti paki thi, doodh ublaa tha
 When everyone went to sleep after dinner, the force of the wind had come after writing the script of destruction with the rain and the courtyard and house went out blowing everything and left Sulekha Kaki just to cry
 soobe ke mukhyamantri helicopter se upar se dekhakar nikal liye
 He appeared on newspapers-channels in a calm-minded manner, giving a verbal rain of compensation, but nobody wants to come to the ground to share the grief of people like Sulekha Kaki
 gaam ke allaudin chachcha kehete hai-“ tum to kheti kisaani karte hue likhte padhate bhi ho na! tab to tumhen pataa hona chahie ki soobe main chunaav hone vaale hai
 Now even the storm has started coming on time for the political leaders
 
 
 
 "after saying this, Chacha's eyes filled up and he started showing me his bamboo where the bamboo is uprooted
 
 
 kisaani karte hue ham sunahare bhavishya kaa sapana dekhte rahete hai
 By selling the crop, they are engaged in furthering the car of life
 dekhie na, is baar ummid thi ki fasal acchhee hogi to babuji ko ek baar phir dilli le jaaenge
 Will show it to an experienced neuro surgeon there
 is aashaa ke saath ki ve phir khadey ho jaaen or mujhe samajhaayen ki falaan khet main aalu lagaana to purab ke khet main garma dhan
 i have kept myself in a dilemma about Babuji's health with the hope that he will recover
 pichley do saal se makka kii fasal mere us bharam ko majboot karata rahaa he, lekin is baar wo bharam bhi tut gaya
 This experience will not only be mine but hundreds of farmers like me, who have suffered the devastation of the storm this time
 kal raat radio par suna ki loksabhaa main shoonyakaal ke dauraan sansad main tufaan se hui tabaahi kaa mudda chaaya rahaa
 The request of a farmer like me is that the issue of farming should not be made the cover page of the book of politics
 purniya or prabhavit jile ke kisaanon tak sahaayta pahunche
 Try to think of the people sitting in Delhi about the farmer whose weeds have spread, think of those houses where the roof has blown away in the air and the crying children are crying in the sun
 yah sab ankhon se dekh rahaa hum
 The camera lens refuses to take pictures
 tippaniyan The editor sitting inside his mind is refusing to market the misery, he says, through words, convey your words to the people
 shabd kii takat aisi hoti he ki vah dil ko chhu letaa he
 After listening to my mind, i am scared and give one glance to my field and then turn and see Babuji lying on the bed
 sochataa hum ki yadi ve thik rahete to mujhe samajhaate- “daro mat, lado
 You have to fight while farming and then they would say some idiom and say go go and feel the scene of destruction so that you can see your suffering less because you have suffered more and more
 “ i express my grief through words as a farmer
 is baar kii tabaahi mujhe sukhar kar rahi he
 The figure of destruction continues to grow
 kisaani ke muddon se raajnneeti kii roti senkane vaale logon se dar bhi lag rahaa he
 Compensation is yet to be distributed
 logon tak muaavje kii raashi kab pahonchegi yaa kitni pahonchegi, ye bhi ek kahani hogi
 We will all be the characters in the story, which will be forgotten by us later
 lekin yaad rakhie, roti ke liye gehun , chaaval ke liye dhan or multiplex main aapke popcorn ke liye makka ham sab hi upjate hai
 If a thunderstorm can destroy us, remember that a good monsoon will also give us a bumper crop
 ham haar nahin maanenge
 We know that we only have to sow seeds in our hands
 fasal kii niyati prakruti ke haathon main hai
 We will not give up due to storm and rain
 sarkari muaavja hamaare bank-khaaton main kab pahonchega ye to hamen pataa nahin, lekin itnaa to jarur pataa he ki agali fasal ke liye hamen khub mehnat kerani he
 Having to bear the brunt of the weather, you have to muster up courage and re-enter the fields
 keval apane or parivaar ke pet ke liye nahin balki aap sabon ke dining teble ke liye bhi
 Till yesterday, the field in which the young maize plant was fluttering on its youth, we saw it weeping in front of our eyes in the lap of the earth
 kheti karte hue hamane janaa ki har fasal hamaare liye santan he
 Paddy is like a daughter to me, then Mecca is my son, who gives me a year's worth of ration water
 us makke ko jab maine khet main ludhake dekha to man ke saare taar ek saath tut gaye
 When i used to do journalism in an air conditioned cabin office, we used to talk about the village countryside during lunch time
 aah graamy jivan! jaise jumale se gaanv ghar kii baaten karte the
 For us, the village was like a legend at that time, in which there is only happiness
 ham anchal kii saanskrithik smriti main hari doob kii talash kiya karte the, lekin jab kisaani karne dharti par utre to jaan gaya ki is dharti par kisaani hi ek aisa pesha he jahaan ham sau fisadi prakruti par nirbhar hote hai or yahaan sukh kii talash main dukh se roj milnajulana hota he
 We create wealth due to nature and we also see wealth flowing in water due to that
 gaam kii sulekha kaaki kaa angan mangal kii raat tabah ho gaya
 Bread was cooked in the courtyard stove at night, milk was boiled
 khaane ke baad sab jab sone gaye tabhi hawa kaa jor barish ke sang tabaahi kii patakatha likhakar aa chukaa tha or angan-ghar sab kuch udaate hue nikal gaya or chhod diya sulekha kaaki ko bas rone ke liye
 The Chief Minister of the state got out of the helicopter from above
 muaavja kii maukhik barish karte hue ve shant-chitt mudra main akhabaaron –channelon par avatarit hue lekin sulekha kaaki jaise logon kaa dukh baantne jameen par koi nahin aana chahta
 Alauddin Chacha of Gam says- “you do not even read farming while writing farming! Then you should know that elections are going to be held in the state
 ab to tufaan bhi siyaasi karne waalon ke liye vakt par aane laga he
 
 
 
 “ itnaa kehane ke baad chachcha kii ankhen bhar ain or ve mujhe apni bansbatti dikhaane lage jahaan bans ukhde pade hai
 
 
 While doing farming, we keep dreaming of a golden future
 fasal bechakar jivan kii gaadi ko or aage badhaane main lage rahete hai
 See, this time it was expected that the crop would be good, then Babuji would be taken to Delhi once again
 vahaan kisi anbhavi neuro sarjan se dikhaaenge
 With the hope that they should stand up again and explain to me that planting potatoes in such and such a field heats up paddy in the east
 babuji kii tabiyat ko lekar main khud ko ek bharam main rakhata aayaa hum is aashaa ke saath ki vah thik ho jaaenge
 For the past two years, the maize crop has been strengthening my illusion, but this time it also broke
 ye anubhav keval meraa nahin balki mere jaise sainkadon kisaanon kaa hoga, jisane is baar tufaan kii tabaahi ko bhoga he
 Last night i heard on the radio that during the Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, the issue of the devastation caused by the storm in the Parliament was overshadowed
 mere jaise kisaan kii guzarish bas itani he ki kisaani-mudde ko raajnneeti kii kitaab kaa cover pej na banaaya jaae
 Assistance was reached to the farmers of Purnia and the affected district
 us kisaan ke bare main dilli main baithe log sochane kii koshish karen, jinke ghar main matam failaa he, un gharon ke bare main sochen jahaan ki chat hawa main udakar kahin dur chali gai or bilakhte bachche dhoop main ro rahe hai
 i am seeing all this with my eyes
 camere kaa lens tasviren lene se manaa kar rahaa he
 The comments man ke bheetar baitha khud kaa sampadak dukh kii marketing karne se manaa kar rahaa he, vah kahata he shabdon ke jariye logon tak apni baaten pahunchaao
 The power of the word is such that it touches the heart
 man kii baat sunakar main saham jaataa hum or ek najar phir apane khet kii ore detaa hum or phir mudakar bichhaavan par lete babuji ko dekhne lagata hum
 i think that if they were alright, they would explain to me - "don't be afraid, fight
 kisaani karte hue ladanaa padataa he or phir ve kuch muhaavara sunaate or kehete ki jaao ghumo or tabaahi ke manjar ko mahasoos karo taaki tumhen apana dukh kam dikhne lage kyonki tumse bhi zyada kshati or logon kii hui he
 " kisaani karte hue khud kaa dukh main shabdon ke jariye bayaan karata hum
 The destruction of this time is pleasing to me
 tabaahi kaa aankada badhata hi ja rahaa he
 People who bake the bread of politics are also afraid of farming issues
 muaavja kaa bandarbaant hona abhi baaki he
 When the amount of compensation will reach the people or how much will be reached, it will also be a story
 ham sab us katha ke charitra honge, jise baad har koi hamen bhuulaa degaa
 But remember, we all grow wheat for bread, rice for rice and maize for your popcorn in multiplexes
 yadi ek aandhi hamen barabaad kar sakati he to yaad rakhie ek acha monsoon hamen banpar fasal bhi degaa
 we will not give up
 ham jaanate hai ki hamaare haath main keval beej bona he
 The destiny of the crop is in the hands of nature
 aandhi or barish kii maar se ham haar nahin maanenge
 We do not know when the government compensation will reach our bank-accounts, but we do know for sure that we have to work very hard for the next crop
 mausam kii maar sahane ke baad himmat jutakar phir se kheton main lag janaa he
 Not just for your own and family's stomachs, but also for the dining tables of all of you
 jab main vaataanukoolit cabin vaale offis main patrakarita kiya karata tha to lunch time main ham gaanv dehaat kii baaten karte the

 Let us know that a few days ago, Union Minister Jitendra Singh had said that after the elimination of special state status to Jammu and Kashmir, now people should pray for pok to join India
 unhone ek baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha tha ki ham khushkismat hai ki yah (vishesh darje ko radd karnaa) hamaare jeevankaal main hua

 Defending the Centre's decision to abolish the special status enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and divide the state into two union territories, Singh said, "nothing happens overnight
" anuchhed 370 or jammu kashmir ke samvidhan ke vyapak adhyayan evam anusandhan ke baad hi is vishay ke vidwatajanon ne is vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kiya he

 This step has been taken in accordance with the special provisions and the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution

 com / tzd68uecvm aaj lingayat samaaj ke darshanik or samaaj sudhaarak basaweshwar bhagwaan kii jayanti he
 Many leaders are celebrating his birth anniversary on this occasion and paying tribute to him
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi bengalooru main basaweshwar bhagwaan kii jayanti manaai or maalyarpan kiya
 Let us know who were Basaveshwara and what their contribution is in reducing the evils spread in the society
 
 
 - basaweshwar bhagwaan ko hindu dharm main jati vyavastha or anya kuritiyon ke khilaaf sangharsh karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 He is also called Vishva Guru, Bhakti Bhandari and Basava
 unhone ling, jati, saamaajik sthiti kii parvaah kiye bina sabhi logon ko baraabar avasar dene kii baat kahi thi
 He is a supporter of the concept of formless God
 - sant basaweshwar kaa janm 1131 isvi main bagebadi (karnataka ke sanyukt bijapur jile main sthit) main hua tha
 He broke this thread at the age of 8 after the Upanayana rite (janeu)
 - unhone us daur main kai padon par apni sevaayen bhi di thim
 There was discrimination on the basis of poor and rich and caste in the society
 jiske khilaaf unhone aawaaj uthaai
 Tatya first fought the war of independence! The British had to dust - Basveshwar, a saint who fought to end female oppression 800 years ago
 saath hi wo shiv ke upaask the or unhone mathon, mandiron main faili kuritiyon, andhvishwaason or amiron kii satta ko chunauti di
 a saint by whose name an entire era of Kannada literature is known
 - basaweshwar khud brahman parivaar main janme the
 He opposed the dominant system of Brahmins
 ve janm aadhaarit vyavastha kii jagah karm aadhaarit vyavastha main vishwaas karte the
 He founded this new sect, called Lingayat, to remove the Kurits
 bataa den lingayat pehle hindu vaidic dharm kaa hi paalan karata tha
 'indus Valley Civilization was over due to 900 years of drought' - Lingayat society is counted among the forward castes of Karnataka
 karnataka kii aabaadi kaa 18 fisadi lingayat hai
 The nearby states like Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh also have a significant population of Lingayats
 - lingayat sampradaay ke log naa to vedon main vishwaas rakhte hai or naa hi murti puja main
 Lingayats do not worship the Lord Shiva of the Hindus but provide a way to worship the Lord in the proper shape as "ishtalinga"
 - ishtling andey ke aakaar kii gendnuma akruti hoti he jise ve dhaage se apane sharir par baandhte hai
 Lingayats consider this ishtalinga a symbol of inner consciousness
 niraakaar paramatma ko maanav yaa praaniyon ke aakaar main kalpit na karke vishwa ke aakaar main ishtling kii rachana kii gai he
 - Lingayats also do not believe in rebirth
 lingayaton kaa maananaa he ki ek hi jivan he or koi bhi apane karmon se apane jivan ko swarg or narak bana saktaa he

 The dreadful face of terror in Nice in France, everyone's soul trembled
 naa bam, naa bandook
 a lorry coming at a speed of 70 km gave a new speed to the fear of terror
 puure do kilometre tak 70 kii raftaar se ek lorie sadak par daud rahi thi
 At that time there were thousands of people on the road
 tej raftaar lorie dekh kar log achaanak bhaagane lage
 But Laurie was constantly chasing those fleeing people and crushing them under her wheels
 aath minute baad jab lorie rukii tab tak 80 se zyada logon kii jaan ja chuki thi
 The country which used to be filled with the fragrance of perfume, was left in the fiza of France, it was just panic
 pehle 'smaili' phir 'france'dilli se kareeb 6 hajaar kilometre dur samandar kinare basaa france kaa khubasurat shahar nise
 France's National Day was a holiday and thousands of people gathered to enjoy fireworks on the seaside near the city's famous French Riviera Resort
 nise kii is masti se bas kuch der pehle encripted phone app telegram par achaanak ek smaili image aata he
 The image was released on behalf of United Cyber khalifa
 kuch second ke is smaili image ke baad achaanak ek shabd kaa ek massej aata he 'france
 Laurie first arrived at the speed of '70 and then France
 jaahir he iskaa matlab kisi ko samaj nahin aayaa or jab samaj aayaa tab pataa chalaa ki ye france par hamale kaa ek nayaa code tha
 As the city was on vacation, people were on the streets and then, despite no entry, suddenly a huge and big lorry started running on the same road on the sea shore at a speed of about 70 kilometers per hour, on which the old and old, Children and women were having fun
 bedardi se logon ko rondabelgaum lorie kii raftaar dekh kar pehle to yahi laga ki shaayad driver kaa lorie par control nahin rahaa yaa phir lorie kaa brake fail ho gaya
 After seeing this, there was a rumor on the road that the bus screamed all around
 lorie sadak par maujuud logon ko apane pahie tale kuchalate hue lagaataar usee raftaar se aage badhane laga
 Within a minute, people's misconceptions were dispelled
 galatfahami ye ki lorie kaa brake fail he yaa driver kaa lorie par control nahin rahaa kyonki sadak par ghuste hi ab lorie logon kaa peechha kar-kar ke unhen rond rahaa tha
 After eight minutes of chaos, after crushing people for eight minutes and two kilometers, the lorry finally stops at one place
 iske baad achaanak lorie kaa driver baahar nikalataa he
 This time he had an automatic weapon in his hand
 wo baahar nikalate hi ab bheed kaa nishaanaa lekar goliyaan barasaani shuru kar detaa he
 It was now believed for the first time that it was not an accident but another terrorist attack on the land of France
 wo aatankwaadi hamalaa jiske bare main bas kuch der pehle hi is smaili ke code ke saath iesas ne apana paigaam jari kiya tha
 The citizen of Tunisia was a terrorist, it is clear that by now the security agencies of France had also got an idea
 lihaaja lorie ke driver ko firing karte dekh wo bhi javaabi firing karte hai
 In which the lorry driver is killed
 iske baad lorie kii talaashi lee jaati he
 He was alone in the entire lorry
 haa, lorie ke andar kaaphi hathiyaar zarur rakhe the
 The papers recovered from the lorry then reveal that the lorry driver was a citizen of Tunisia but lived in Nice
 uske taar bagdadi ke iesas se jude the
 The third major attack in a year was the third ISIS attack on France in the last year and that too when Emergency has been in force to deal with terror in France since the first attack
 jis nise shahar ko city of victory yani vijay kaa shahar kaha jaataa tha, vahaan logon kii bhagdad or cheekh-pukaar ke bich agar koi haara he to wo he insaaniyat
 a victim of terror, Nees has also been witness to the crusade between Christianity and Islam hundreds of years ago
 aaj phir itihaas doharaav ke kagaar par he jab dharm ke naam par khooni jang chede iesas ke khatre ne duniya kii tasviir ko bhayanak bana diya he
 In order to save lives, terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al Qaeda have already spoken of making vehicles a means of terror
 udhar, chashmadidon kii maane to nise kii sadakon par daude maut ke is trek ne jo koharaam machaaya he, vaisaa kisi ke liye soch paanaa bhi mushkil he
 Many people say that the truck was continuously moving at a speed of sixty to seventy kilometers per hour, crushing people and the condition was that hundreds of people jumped into the sea to save lives
 delivery driver tha aatankifrance ke adhikarik sutron kii maane to ye 31 saal kaa ek shaks tha, jiskaa naam mohammad lahuej buhel tha
 He was a French citizen of Tunisia origin, who lived in the same city where he carried out the attack
 mauka-e-vaardaat par use goliyon se dher karne ke baad jab police ne uske trek kii talaashi lee, to kuch dastavejon se uski pahchaan saaf hui
 According to the police, he worked as a delivery driver and was caught in small crimes once but he was such a dreadful terrorist, it was just revealed
 badha di gai immergencyhaalanki abhi uske sidhe taur par iesas ke sampark main hone ke koi pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai, lekin jis tarah iesas ke telegram channel kii ore se hamale se pehle ek encripted massej main france kaa naam likhaa gaya tha, usase shaq he ki is hamale ke peeche iesas hi he
 On the other hand, after several months of the attacks in Paris, France was now slowly returning from emergency to normal life, but now after this attack, the government has once again declared Emergency in the entire country
 pichley 18 maheenon main ye teesraa mauka he, jab france khun ke aansu royaa he
 The first terrorist attack on France took place in January last year when the ISIS targeted the Charley Hebdo magazine
 phir das maheene baad hi france par sabase bada aatankwaadi hamalaa hua
 ISIS raided seven places in Paris, killing 147 people and now Nice has been attacked
 7 janvari, 2015 ko sharli habdo par hamalaihi wo din tha, jab apane krantikari patrakarita ke liye puri duniya main mashhoor france kii patrika sharli habdo ke daftar main aatankwaadi hamalaa hua
 Two armed men entered the office and started firing indiscriminately
 or jab tak police ne hamalaavaron ko dher kiya, tab tak teen pulicekarmiyon samet kul 17 logon kii jaan ja chuki thi
 This was the first terrorist attack in France in recent times, which started a new debate in the whole world about the spread of terror and freedom of the press as well as the spread of terror
 darasal, sharli habdo megsine par paigambar mohammad kaa cartoon chhap kar unki bekadri karne kaa ilzaam tha lekin is iljaam kaa badla aatankwaadi is tarah lenge, ye kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Later it became clear that ISIS was behind this attack
 13 november, 2015 ko paris main katleamphrance abhi sharli habdo par hue hamale se puri tarah ubar bhi nahin sakaa tha ki thik das maheene baad is desh ne apane seene par dehshatgardi kaa doosraa waar jhela
 This day, terrorists stormed seven bases simultaneously in the French capital of Paris and started firing rapidly
 jisamen kul 130 log maare gaye or is hamale ke peeche bhi iesas hi tha
 How terrible this attack was, can only be gauged from the fact that after the second world war, this attack was called the second biggest attack in France
 vaise to is hamale ke dauraan hi france police or alag-alag suraksha agenciyon ne zyaadaatar aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar diya, lekin hamale kaa mastermind abdelslam chakma dekar nikal bhaagane main kaamyaab rahaa
 However Abdelsalam was arrested in April 2016 following a terrorist attack in Belgium
 14 july, 2016 ko nise main hamalaaye pichley 18 maheenon ke dauraan france par hua teesraa aatankwaadi hamalaa he, jise iesas kii ore se hi anjaam diya gaya he
 But the most special and most surprising thing about this attack is the way to execute it
