 BJP adhyaksh amit shah ne chunavi raily main CM nitish kumaar par karaara prahaar kiya he
 Amit Shah alleged that Nitish betrayed the people of Bihar and threw a dagger on bjp's back
 unhone lalu-nitish par aarakshan ke mudde par jhooth bolne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 From the time of BJP Jana Sangh, reservation supporter Amit Shah alleged that lalu-nitish are spreading confusion among the public by deliberately lying on the issue of reservation
 unhone daawa kiya ki bijepi jansangh ke samay se aarakshan ke samarthan main hai, isamen badlaav kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 He said that Lalu does politics of socialism and backward, but distributes tickets to sons
 lalu ke liye parivaar pehle he
 While campaigning in Begusarai, Amit Shah said that he had met Lalu Prasad, who brought Jungle Raj, who opposed Jungle Raj
 unhone daawa kiya ki lalu-nitish kii jodi bihar ko aage nahin le paaegi
 He said that incidents of kidnapping, dacoity and bloodshed were frequent during Jungle Raj
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki jaiprakash narayan ne congress ke khilaaf hi 'sampurna kranti' kaa naaraa diya tha, lekin ab jepi ke anuyaayi lalu or nitish ne congress ke saath milakar gathbandhan kaayam kiya he
 He said that Nitish can betray anyone to gain power
 BJP kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala badhaate hue amit shah ne kaha ki yah party kaaryakartaaon ke parishram se jitati ai he
 Significantly, Shah is on a 7-day tour of Bihar for campaigning
 ram mandir ko lekar ajtak ke 'oparation ramamandir' ne ram janmabhumi cese ke hindu or muslim pakshakaron kii pole kholkar rakh di he
 This disclosure will shock every patriotic citizen of the country who has faith in the biggest temple of justice i
e
 the Supreme Court
 'oparation ramamandir' ko anjaam dene ke liye ajtak ke andercover reporters khufia camaron ke saath ayodhya main un pakshakaron se mili jo camaron ke saamne ram janmabhumi cese ko lekar supreme court par bharosa jataate hai
 But as soon as the camera is off, their opinion also changes
 sampradayik tanaav kaa ek purana mudda jisko lekar ab sabar kaa baandh kamjor pad rahaa he
 On the one hand there is the impatience of the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and on the other side is the Supreme Court, from where the date is being met in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute case
 lekin ramamandir ke mudde par hindu or muslim yachikakarta jo bolte hai, kya vaisaa hi asal main sochate bhi hai? ajtak ke khufia camaron main ram janmabhumi ke muslim pakshakaron ne ise lekar apni jis visphotak soch ko ujagar kiya he, use jaanakar aapke rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 In the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute case, you must have heard the Muslim party Haji Mehboob in front of the cameras respecting the Supreme Court's decision and favoring the Ram temple
 ek baar to wo ramamandir ke liye court ke baahar samjhauta karne ke liye raji tak ho chuke the
 He had said that if Babri leaves the site of the mosque, then we have no objection if Hindus build their temple
 lekin jab ajtak ke andercover reporter ne ayodhya main haji mehboob se ghar par unase baatcheet kii to unki domunhi soch saamne aa gai
 Haji Mehboob- Even today, if a judgment comes in the mosque issue, do you know mian, can you put a brick there
 maine to chalange bhi kiya tha, hamane kaha jab tak jinda hum ek eent rakh kar bataaen
 Reporter - Even after Judgment? Even after the Supreme Court Judgment
 
 Haji Mehboob - Yes, yes, please tell
 
 inshaallah, as long as i am alive, i say the right thing
 
 i speak 
 They cannot keep a brick in my life
 
 No matter what they do
 
 Reporter - Ram temple? Haji Mehboob - Remember yes
 
 Reporter - Even if it is a Judgment of the Supreme Court? Haji Mehboob - Whether it is a Judgment of the Supreme Court
 
 Even if there is a judgment in the world
 
 i am a Muslim and a small Muslim, i am a criminal, but they cannot keep a brick in my life
 
 Reporter - You will not even accept the Supreme Court Judgment? Haji Mehboob - i will not accept anything
 
 Will remember 
 Click here to see Operation Ram Mandir
 
 
 yani jo haji mehboob khule camaron ke saamne supreme court par bharosa jataate nahin thakte, vahi haji mehboob khufia camere par supreme court ke faisle ko thenga dikhaate sune ja sakate hai
 When we asked Haji Mehboob that if he would not allow Ram temple to be built even after the Supreme Court's decision, then the situation in the country could worsen
 to haji mehboob kaa jawaab ye tha
 
 
 Reporter - Just like you are saying that the judgment of the Supreme Court also came in the favor of the Hindus, you will not allow a brick to be placed on the temple
 
 Haji Mehboob - i will not allow it
 
 i to you 
 You are Muslim, so i am saying, otherwise, i said that brother is fine, Judgment will come, will be seen
 maine to ye kaha
 
 lekin yakeen maniye
 
 koi bhi musalmaan usko bardaasht nahin kar saktaa
 
 reporter - to klesh hoga, ye to desh main ?haji mehboob - klesh hota
 
 hoga
 
 hona hi he, isamen kya do raay he
 
 haji mehboob ne ajtak ke khufia camere par sirf ram mandir hi nahin, balki nyaay ke sabase bade mandir ko lekar bhi apni dogali soch ko ujagar kar diya
 But the question is how Haji Mehboob is making such a big claim with so much confidence
 iskaa jawaab bhi hamen khud haji mehboob ne hi diya
 Haji Mehboob confessed on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera that in 1992 he had planted bombs himself in a deteriorating environment in Ayodhya and no one was able to spoil him
 haji mehboob - main to jhooth bolta nahin hum
 What happens is that the world knows that Haji Mehboob had planted bombs
 maine chalavaaya tha
 There are no two opinions
 reporter - bam chalavaaye the aapane ?haji mehboob - bilkul chalavaaye the
 
 haji mehboob - ye he prashasan bhi, khuda kaa karam he
 She is very afraid of me
 
 Reporter - here in Ayodhya? Haji Mehboob - What is Ayodhya, whatever Faizabad is
 
 Haji Mehboob revealed the hidden intentions in his heart about the Ram temple and the Ram Janmabhoomi case on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera
 to ab sawaal ye tha ki ayodhya main ramamandir ko lekar jo iraade haji mehboob rakhte hai
 At the same time, the rest of the Muslim parties of the Ram Janmabhoomi case are also kept
 babari masjid ke khilaaf aayaa faisla to manjuur nahin- ikbaal ansariram janmabhumi vivaad cese main babari masjid ke pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari bhi haji mehboob kii tarah hi camaron ke saamne kah chuke hai ki agar ramamandir nirmaan ko lekar modi sarkaar adhyadesh laati he, to unhen koi aitraaj nahin hoga
 On 20 November, he said that if the law is being benefited by the country
 aman chaiyn he to kanoon banaaen, vahiin se kanoon bananaa he, vahiin se kanoon banegaa
 Listening to the words of Iqbal Ansari on camera, it seems that he has a lot of faith in the law
 lekin camaron ke peeche ikbaal ansaari bhi haji mehboob kii taraf palat jate hai
 On Aaj Tak's intelligence camera, Iqbal Ansari can be heard saying that if the Supreme Court verdict comes against the Babri Masjid, he will not accept it and no one else will be ready to accept Muslims
 reporter - aapako lagata he log supreme court kaa faisla maan lenge
 
 ?ikbaal ansaari - ayodhya, ye babari masjid he
 The whole world knows this
 to aise main supreme court faisla kar de
 
 jaise log mantri kaa naam 5 saal baad jaan jate hai
 
 vaise hi babari masjid ko aane vaali kai peedi jaanegi ki yah masjid ayodhya main he
 This is the name Babri Masjid
 reporter - main vahi kah rahaa hum isliye supreme court kaa ye faisla nahin maanegaa koi
 
 iqbaal ansaari - koi nahin maanegaa
 
 reporter - nahin maanegaa na ?iqbaal ansaari - koi nahin maanegaa
 
 jab hamane of camera babari masjid ke pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari se poocha ki agar faisla musalamaanon ke paksh main nahin aayaa to kya hoga
 Iqbal Ansari's opinion on this also matched Haji Mehboob's opinion
 reporter - to supreme court kaa faisla agar musalaamanon ke khilaaf aayaa to musalmaan nahin maanenge?iqbaal ansaari - nahin maanenge
 Reporter - If you don't believe in Muslims, what will you do? Iqbal Ansari - You are a Muslim
 
 What will you do 
 Reporter - Gusaikbal Ansari - So will the life Loriporter - then there will be a ruckus in the country? Iqbal Ansari - organically created
 
 That is, neither Iqbal Ansari nor Haji Mehboob are not in favor of allowing Ram temple to be built on the disputed land in Ayodhya
 phir chahen supreme court hi kyon naa ramamandir nirmaan kaa aadesh de de
 That is, the thinking of these two Muslim parties in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute is twisted
 ek wo jo on camere par bolte hai or ek wo jo ajtak ne aapako bataaya
 Now the question is that when Muslim parties do not have to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, then why are they fighting the case
 
 
 ?is sawaal kaa jawaab haji mehboob ke us daawey main miltaa he jo unhone ajtak ke khufia camere par kiya he
 Haji Mehboob clearly said that the All India Muslim Personal Law Board is earning a lot of money in the name of Babri Masjid
 
 
 reporter - ab jabaki ayodhya par unka bhi daawa he babari masjid par
 
 haji mehboob - hareporter - personal lau board kaa
 
 haji mehboob - are ye sab daawa to usee liye aa rahaa he, usee par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 
 jo bhi aa rahaa he ayodhya ke naam par aa rahaa he
 
 reporter - acha paisa bhi aa rahaa he inke paas?haji mehboob - bahut aayaa he
 
 or kahaan se laa rahe hai
 
 koi apni jeb se ladata he masjid kaa mukadedma, jo lard rahe hai
 
 haji mahabuuba kaa daawa he ki ol india personal lau board babari masjid ke naam par raajnneeti karata he or babari masjid ke naam par naa sirf deshbhar se balki videsh se bhi paisa aata he
 
 
 Reporter - Where is the funding coming from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board? Haji Mehboob - he knows? Reporter - as you are saying, a lot of money came to him in the name of Ayodhya Babri Masjid? Haji Mehboob - Hey, everywhere Coming from Libya
 
 Many times in front of us
 
 The words of Haji Mehboob open the game of politics in the name of Babri Masjid
 haji mehboob daawa karte hai ki babari masjid par raajnneeti karke apni jeben bharne vaale log kabhi nahin chaahate ki ye masalaa kabhi hal ho
 Haji Mehboob - See in our community, they also do not want to end this issue
 
 Reporter - People of our community do not even want, Muslims do not want? Haji Mehboob - Nobody wants
 
 Reporter - Let the issue of Ayodhya be resolved
 
 The The reason for this, Sir Haji Mehboob - if you will keep on rotating and roti, as long as it lasts
 
 
 haji mehboob kii baton se babari masjid ke pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari bhi ittefaq rakhte hai
 Iqbal Ansari admitted that many institutions and people are just doing politics and earning money in the name of Babri Masjid
 
 
 ikbaal ansaari - koun karata he
 
 ham aaj bhi kehete hai koun karata he madad
 
 aana janaa jo he
 
 naam to babari masjid kaa he
 
 tamaam log din bhar aate jate hai
 
 aap log agar hamaari jagah par ho to
 
 aapako maaloom ho jaataa ki kitne log hamaari madad karte hai
 
 hamaare kaam par to bahut se log kamaate hai
 
 koun kya detaa he
 
 vahaan jo he desh kaa kaam bataaenge, ayodhya jate hai to musalaamanon kii dekh-rekh karte hai
 
 yahaan chanda ho rahaa he, vahaan chanda ho rahaa he
 
 yahaan koun lag ke detaa he chanda
 
 reporter - matlab aapke naam par kama bhi rahe hai log ?ikbaal ansaari - tamaam log kamaate hai
 
 yahi hamaare walid sahab ke time par bhi rahaa
 
 log khaali bevakoof banaate hai
 
 raajnneeti karte hai
 
 ajtak ke khufia camere par ikbaal ansaari ne khulaasa kiya ki ram janmabhumi ko lekar court se baahar madhyasthata kar chuke ek muslim dharmaguru ne unhen babari masjid kaa cese chhodane ke liye ek ofer bhi diya gaya tha
 
 ikbaal ansaari - kahe lakhanu main aadha bisraa zamin le lo bhai
 
 reporter - kya bole aapse ?ikbaal ansaari - aadha bisraa jameen lakhanu main le lo
 
 wasim rizvi de rahaa he
 
 reporter - aadha bisraa kya hota he ?ikbaal ansaari - matlab 600 sq ft
 Reporter - 600 sq ft
 jameen lakhanu main le lo
 
 ikbaal ansaari - haa, lakhanu main
 
 reporter - kis cheez ke liye ?ikbaal ansaari - masjid ke liye
 
 ikbaal ansaari jo daawa kar rahe hai, usamen kitni sachai he ye to wo khud hi jaanate honge, lekin ikbaal ansaari ne ajtak ke khufia camere par ye bhi daawa kiya ki upi main samaajawaadee sarkaar ban gai to unke beton kii naukari lagani tay he
 Iqbal Ansari - This time Akhilesh government will come, it will be done in that
 
 This is what we have expected
 
 Reporter - Talking to anyone? Iqbal Ansari - will be done now
 
 It is a conversation
 
 Reporter - will be the job in the next UP government? Iqbal Ansari - The reporter - is your conversation? Iqbal Ansari - Yes Iqbal Ansari seems to hear that while being a party to Babri Masjid, he can also juggle the pulses and bread of his coming generations Have been jisase pataa chalata he ki babari masjid kaa pakshakaar banane ke kitne phaayde hai
 In conclusion, the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute is a means of politics for Muslim parties
 jise wo kisi bhi keemat par haath se jane dena nahin chaahate
 Will the Hindu parties accept that the Supreme Court will give a verdict in favor of the Babri Masjid and what the Hindu parties will do if the Supreme Court's decision comes against the Ram temple
 
 
 kya hindu pakshakaar apane khilaaf faisle ko maan lenge
 
 
 ? In this connection, the next meeting of Aajtak's Special Investigation Team was held in the case of Ram Janmabhoomi in the Supreme Court on behalf of Trilokinath Pandey
 triloki nath pandeya ayodhya ke karsevak puram main rahete hai
 Trilokinath Pandey - Why don't the judges give the verdict
 
 Why did it take 77 years
 
 i am asking you 
 ? Reporter - No, yes
 
 We do not know
 
 Why are you not giving it? Trilokinath Pandey - Now time will answer it
 
 Do not ask us, God
 
 There will be some intention
 
 To make some decisions about this country
 
 But it is certain that Hindu society will not compromise on Ram Janmabhoomi
 mandir jarur banegaa chaahe hook or chaahe crukayaani muslim pakshakaar apane khilaaf faisla nahin maanenge or hindu pakshakaar apane khilaaf faisla nahin maanenge, lekin agar supreme court kaa faisla khilaaf aayaa to hindu pakshakaar kya karenge
 In response to this question, Trilokinath Pandey expressed his intention to change the constitution
 
 
 reporter - agar maan lijiye sar, supreme court kaa fansla aa gaya or muslaanon ko ye haq diya gaya ki aap masjid bana lijiye, us sthaan par, to ab wo banane lagenge
 
 trilokinath pandeya - kaise bana lenge
 
 janata kii adaalat main jaaenge
 
 reporter - unke saath kanoon, police or prashasan hoga na usko banavaane ke liye
 
 trilokinath pandeya - hamaare saath bhi koi na koi khadaa ho jayega
 
 police ko khadaa karti he janata
 
 samvidhan ko khadaa karti he janata
 
 sarkaar ko banaati he janata
 
 nayaa samvidhan banegaa, nai police banegi, nayaa court banegaa, nayaa system khadaa hoga
 
 supreme court main ramamandir ke pakshakaar trilokinath pandey kaa daawa he ki ramamandir ke khilaaf aayaa koi bhi faisla koi bhi hindu nahin maanegaa
 
 or puure desh main hangaamaa ho jayega
 
 
 Reporter - will not consider Supreme Court order as Hindu? Trilokinath Pandey - will not accept
 
 Reporter - And you are saying that instead of having the same religion parliament, there will be a similar religion court? Trilokinath Pandey - No, there will not be a religion court
 
 There will be a new constitution
 
 a new upheaval will come in the world
 
 Reporter - Then there will be uproar in the country
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - Done
 
 If the country wants it will happen
 
 Trilokinath Pandey claims that every obstacle that comes in the way of Ram temple will be removed
 
 
 lekin jab ajtak ke andercover reporter ne poocha ki vaajapeyi sarkaar main ramamandir kyon nahin ban paaya to unhone ek kissa sunaaya
 
 
 Trilokinath Pandey - After Atal ji's government, in government itself
 
 Ashok Singhal's conversation with Atal ji and Advani ji ceased and there was no speech for life
 
 Reporter - Reason? Trilokinath Pandey - See, it has been decided that Atal ji's government has to run for 5 years
 
 Reporter - till 2004? Trilokinath Pandey - But this curiosity arose inside the saints as to why the temple is not being discussed in the reign of Atal ji
 
 Ashok ji told Atal ji that there is an authorized area, in which 45 acres of land is owned by Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 
 Give one acre of land to us
 
 
 jo pathar hamaara taiyaar he, jisko ham vahaan rakhwa den taaki duniya kii najar main lage ki ye sarkaar kuch halchal kar rahi he
 
 reporter - ye kisne bolaa sar ?trilokinath pandeya - ashok ji ne
 
 reporter - ashok ji ne
 
 trilokinath pandeya - atal chale gaye court main
 
 supreme court
 
 reporter - atal ji
 
 trilokinath pandeya - or 5 jajon kii bench ne ye kah diya ki aisa nahin ho saktaa he
 
 ye isamen kisi prakaar kaa len-dein, puja-paath, anushthan nahin ho saktaa
 
 to ashok ji ne kaha atal ji se, ab to supreme court ne bain kar diya
 
 ab to ram janmabhumi kaa naam lenaa hi contempat ho jayega
 
 lambe samay se ham log saamaajik jone main kaam kar rahe hai
 
 main suzav dene aayaa hum ki ram janmabhumi kaa vidheyak lie
 
 vidheyak gir jayega
 
 lekin sarkaar bhi gir jaaegi
 
 isi vishay ko lekar janata ke bich main jaaenge or ho saktaa he purna bahumat kii sarkaar aa jaae
 
 reporter - ye 2001 kii baat he ?trilokinath pandeya - nahin, 2003 kii baat he
 
 vahaan adwani ji baithe the
 
 adwani ji ne kaha ki ek mandir kii diwaar ke liye sarkaar qurbaan nahin kii jaaegi
 
 reporter - adwani ji bole ?trilokinath pandeya - jiram janmabhumi cese main hindu pakshakaar trilokinath pandeya ke daavon or khulaason se lagata he ki agar supreme court ne ramamandir ke paksh main faisla nahin sunaaya to hindu sanghathan khilaafat par utar sakate hai
 
 
 Our next meeting was with Mahant Saurabh Das of Santoshi Akhara
 
 
 mahant saurabh das ke anusaar santoshi akhaada, nirmohi akhaade kii hi ek shakha he or nirmohi akhaada ram janmabhumi cese main ek or pakshakaar he
 Saurabh Das claimed on Aaj Tak's intelligence camera that even if the verdict does not come true, the Ram temple will still be built at any cost
 aisa kaise hoga
 Listen to the words of Mahant Saurabh Das himself
 
 
 reporter - agar aapke paksh main nirnay nahin aata he to uski kya taiyaari he ?saurabh das - uski to taiyaari phir ab vahi log karenge, jo hamaare bade hai
 
 reporter - wo jo aapse kahenge, aap kar denge ?saurabh das - wo hamen karnaa hi padegaa
 
 reporter - wo mahant, sadhu sant jo kahenge 
 
 saurabh das - unka sahyog puraa karenge
 
 tan man dhan se
 
 reporter - chaahe wo aapse hinsak andolan karne ko kahen ?saurabh das - wo to baad kii baat he
 
 yani muslim pakshakaron kii tarah hi hindu pakshakaar bhi ram janmabhumi par supreme court ke us faisle par apana faisla suna chuke hai
 
 
 When the date of hearing in the Supreme Court regarding the verdict has not yet been decided
 
 
 oparation ram mandir ke khulaase dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki hindu pakshakaar hon yaa muslim pakshakaar, donon ko supreme court ke faisle se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 These are the people who have also made the subject of faith a game of politics and power
 aise logon ko benakaab karnaa ajtak apana ferj samajhataa he
 Because it is not necessary that the truth should be what is before your eyes
 kai baar sach aapaki ankhon se chipa rah jaataa he or kai baar jaanboojhkar chipa diya jaataa he
 Aajtak has revealed this hidden truth about the Ram temple through Operation Ram Mandir
 india today ke 'oparation ram mandir' par bijepi iti cell ke pramukh amit malviya ne ayodhya main vivaadit sthal ke aasapaas kii avivaadit bhoomi ko unke mul maalikon ko dene kii baat kahi
 Let us know that on 29 January, the Central Government has moved the Supreme Court for permission to undisputedly return 67 acres of land to its original owners including Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 malviya ne kaha, 'is maamle par supreme court ke faisle ke baad rajya or centre kii sarkaron par nirbhar hoga ki wo court ke faisle ko shanti se nishpadit karen or ek ram mandir kaa nirmaan ho
 Anyway, that 67 acres of land there is undisputed
 yah sirf ek chota sa hissaa he, jise lekar vivaad he
 However, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) reacted strongly
 vihip ke pravaktaa shriraj nair ne daawa kiya ki unka sanghathan kanoon kaa paalan karne vaala he, lekin vivaadit bhoomi par ram mandir se kam kuch bhi manjuur nahin
 He said, "we are not fighting for just one temple here
 tathakthith vivaadit sthal se devataaon ko hataane kii himmat kismen he
 It is a temple and will always be a temple
 "activist or islamic scollar asad khan falahi ne kanoonee taur par masale ke hal kii baat kahi
 He said, 'the party is not the last word
 main is tarah ke bayaan sunata aa rahaa hum
 The same thing will apply and that is the decision of the Supreme Court and the Constitution
 'ol india muslim personal lau board ke sadsy mahmud praachaa, ne falahi kii baat ko doharaaya
 He said, 'in India, only the Constitution of India will prevail
 ho saktaa he ki main supreme court ke faisle se khushi nahin mili lekin mujhe us faisle ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 He said, 'haji sahib who is the one to challenge the constitution of India
 jo koi bhi aisa karegaa, ham uski aawaaj ko kanoonee tareeke dabaa denge
 Once again i am saying with full responsibility that the Constitution of India is supreme

 Research conducted in New York has revealed that women who are willing to have physical relationships
 wo laal rang ke kapade pahenti hai
 However, in the Indian context, it would not be right to justify this research
 bharat main vivaahit mahilaayein laal rang ke kapade pahenti hai
 Which is considered as a sign of Suhag
 pehle kiye gaye survey ke mutabik, laal paridhaan main saji mahilaon ko purush sex ke lihaaj se zyada aakarshak maanate hai
 Women also believe that they feel threatened by women dressed in red in the social gathering
 unka maananaa he ki sex kii talash main mahilaayein laal rang ke paridhaan main hoti hai
 Researchers at Rochester University in New York, Trnava University in Slovakia and the Slovak Academy of Sciences said, "if you're in a red dress, you look at other women suspiciously
" yah har haal main nahin hota, lekin duusari mahilaon or purushon ke sanket se saavdhaan rahiye ki aap sex main ruchi leti hai
 Women prefer wearing a red shirt to meet an attractive man, but they do not do so when meeting with a man of choice
 teen shodh main rischars ne yah pataa lagane ke liye haath milaayaa ki laal rang se mahilaon ko kya sanket miltaa he
 In the first experiment, it was found that women, seeing the other in red clothes, consider her more 'eager' for sex than a woman wearing white clothes

 The day of Monday was once again full of uproar in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly
 shivaraj ke vidhansabha kshetra main daliton dwaara ichhamrityu maangane ke maamle ko congress ne apana hathiyaar banaaya or bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 In the Assembly of state Chief Minister Shivraj Singh, 50 Dalit families have asked the CM for permission for euthanasia
 sarkaar kii di jameen par dabangon kaa kabjagaanv waalon kaa aarope he ki saalon pehle sarkaar ne jo jameen unhen aavantit kii thi us par dabango ne kabja kar rakhaa he

 Many villagers have also signed their memorandum in the memorandum and it states that the land which was given by the government in 2002, has been occupied by the Dabango and they have not got that land for 15 years
 yahi nahin gaanv ke dabang gaanv waalon komaarane kii dhamkeebhi dete hai
 As the villagers who have been living for 15 years are now exhausted and the families are dying of hunger, so these people have asked for CM Mishra's death
 budni ke jo gramin ichhamrityu maang rahe hai unamem borkhedi, vasudev, sohankhedi or jogla gaanv ke log hai
 Congress shrugged off now because the matter was about Shivraj Singh Chauhan's assembly, the Congress also took it up and created a ruckus in the assembly
 congress ne sarkaar ko dalit virdohi bataate hue nishaanaa saadhaa
 During this, Congress mlas came out of the House and started shouting slogans
 isse pehle bhi shivaraj kii vidhansabha main ek dalit mahila kii maut ko lekar bhi congress sarkaar par dalit virdohi hone kaa aarope laga chuki he
 Home Minister said that Bhupendra Singh, who has become the new Home Minister in the Shivraj government, has called it a political conspiracy of the Congress
 unhone kaha ki vahaan aisi koi samasya he hi nahin
 The Congress is deliberately making false allegations

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters Rajya Sabha MP Ram Jethmalani has opened a front against BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 jethmalani ne mangalvaar ko bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari se istife kii maang kii
 Jethmalani has advised Gadkari to relinquish the post of party president in the interest of the party and till a clean inquiry
 ram jethmalani ne kaha, ‘nitin gadakari ko jaanch puri hone tak istipha den
 No one proves guilty by resigning
 ’jethmalani ne yah kadaa bayaan apane bete mahesh jethmalani ke istife ke ek din baad diya he
 Significantly, Mahesh Jethmalani has resigned from the National Executive on Monday in protest against Nitin Gadkari's continuation of the post of party president despite being surrounded by allegations
 ram jethmalani ne nitin gadakari kaa swami vivekanand ke saath daaud kaa tulana kiye jane ko apraasangik maanate hue ise nasamajhi main kahi gai baat qaraar diya he
 He said that if Gadkari wants the interest of the party, he should resign
 ram jethmalani ne kaha ki bijepi kaa sheersh netritv gadakari ko adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chahta he lekin koi khulkar nahin bol rahaa he
 Jethmalani claimed that Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Shatrughan Sinha are in touch with him and he hopes he too is not happy with Gadkari

 BJP Rajya Sabha MP Ram Jethmalani had advised Nitin Gadkari about two weeks ago that he should not stand again for the post of BJP President in the light of allegations
 bahut beraham he lutian dilli
 
 
 Large bungalows spread everywhere
 
 
 kabhi bangalon kii nazadikiyaan raisina hill kii ladaai ke liye nae saathi de detii hai to kai baar is ladaai ke liye bangalon ke nazadikiyon ke baavjood dilon main dooriyaan ho jaati hai
 
 
 On January 1, 2004, Sonia Gandhi walked out of her bungalow 10, Janpath and walked 12, home to her neighbor Ramvilas Paswan, who lives in Janpath
 
 
 nae saal ke pehle din padosi se haath milakar unhone upie kii neenv rakhi or paanch maheene baad atal bihari vaajapeyi jaise diggaj ko 7, rescorse road se 6, e krishna menon maarg bhej diya
 
 
 In the same Lutyens' Delhi, once again Thursday was named after Paswan
 
 
 janpath se ashok road tak kaa safar
 
 
 For Narendra Modi, a journey of hope from CM to PM
 
 
 paswan ke liye 'sampradayikta' se 'dharmanirpekshata' or phir 'sampradayikta' tak kaa safar
 
 
 See the strange combination of politics
 
 
 yah sab ghatnakram us din hua, jiske thik baarah saal pehle gujarat ke godhra main sabarmati train jalaai gai thi, jiske baad rajya main dange hue the, jiske maddenjar ramvilas paswan ne kuch mahine baad hi narendra modi ko hataane kii maang karte hue atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar se istipha diya tha
 
 
 However, the experts say that Paswan was angry because the Telecom Ministry was snatched from him
 
 
 baharhaal, bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ramvilas paswan se haath milakar ek tir se do shikaar kiye hai
 
 
 The 17-year alliance with Nitish Kumar in Bihar was quite strong on social grounds, but after the departure of Nitish, some backward and extremely backward castes, Mahadalits and Pasmanda Muslims fell from the NDA
 
 
 bijepi ko is baat kaa ehsaas he ki agar use rajya main badi sankhya main loksabhaa siten jeetni hai to modi ke naam ke alaava soshal ejineering kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 
 
 Party leaders claim that there is an air of Modi in the state, but Narendra Modi himself says that if the tires are made to stand in the air, then it does not automatically fill the air
 
 
 tair main hawa tabhi bhar paaegi, jab poling booth par kaam ho or logon ko matdaan kendron tak laayaa jaae
 
 
 That is, it is clear that to increase the percentage of votes of the BJP, it is necessary to increase the social circle
 
 
 so, party ne bihar main paswan se haath milakar yahi kiya he
 
 
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP got 14 percent votes with Nitish, while Paswan got around 7 percent votes with Lalu Prasad Yadav
 
 
 dilachasp baat yah he ki lalu ke saath gathbandhan main paswan ko 40 main se 12 siton par ladane kaa mauka mila tha, lekin vah ek bhi nahin jeet paae
 
 
 In informal discussions, Paswan's son Chirag, who founded the alliance with the BJP, says that Lalu Prasad played the game behind the scenes and did not let his Yadav votes go to Paswan, while Paswan gave his supporters votes in every seat to the RJD Get it done
 
 
 lalu se rishte tut jane main yah aarope bhi haaavee rahaa he
 
 
 BJP leaders believe that there are about 15 seats where Paswan has between fifty thousand and two lakh votes
 
 
 vaise, paswan hon yaa mayawati, ye donon apane dalit samarthakon ke vot transfar karwaane kii haisiyat rakhte hai
 
 
 Therefore, with Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha, BJP can cross the decisive figure of 30%, hence it has now formed a multi-colored coalition of social justice in Bihar
 
 
 is gathbandhan se bijepi ko doosraa phayda rashtriya str par hota dikh rahaa he
 
 
 It is felt that the coming together of Paswan will change the thinking of potential allies regarding the communal image of Narendra Modi and remove the hesitation of these parties joining the BJP before and after the election
 
 
 bijepi kii nazaren ab pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee, urisa main naveen patnayak or assam main assam gana parishad par tik gai hai
 
 
 Its pre-poll alliance with AGP is also possible in Assam, while it is expected to get support after the election with TMC and BJD
 
 
 tamilnadu main emdmake, piemke or dmdike saath baat chal hi rahi he
 
 
 And within 12 hours of the alliance with Paswan, DMK chief m Karunanidhi's statement has also come, in which he has praised Narendra Modi
 
 
 so, bijepi ko lagata he ki paswan ke saath gathbandhan se uske paksh main bandwagon prabhaav kaam karegaa
 
 
 Anyway, in Lutyens Delhi, it is said about Paswan that where the wind is blowing, Paswan is there

 credit card companiyon ne card par oonchi kharch seemaa rakh kar logon ko mahangi kharidari karne ke liye aakarshith kiya he
 Often they are not paid in full by the stipulated time and credit card holders have to either take a cyclical loan or convert the remaining amount to EMI
 agar aap shesh raashi ko agali nirdhaarit tithi tak khatm karne kii sthiti main hai to chakree rin main buraai nahin he, agar nikat bhavishya main is shesh raashi kaa bhugtan karne kii sthiti main nahin hai to ise iemi main parivartit karwaanaa hi behatar he

 In such a situation, banks charge fixed rate of interest on the converted balance
 ''nunatam dey kaa bhugtan karke chakree rin kaa upyog karne se tulana karen to usamen byaaj kii raashi badhati jaati he or iemi main badalawaane kaa vikalp isaki tulana main kaaphi sasta padataa he
 Gaurav Chopra, founder and CEO of indialends, says, "three factors affect the rate of interest on a loan when converted to EMI: (a) the credit profile of the borrower (b) the term of the loan and (c) the bank's Internal policies
 saamanyat: credit card se lenden ke baad iemi main parivartit karaae gaye in rinon par 14 se 21 pratishat vaarshik kii dar se byaaj liya jaataa he jabaki credit card par lagbhag 42 pratishat vaarshik dar se byaaj dena hota he
 But the options for change in EMI are not the same in all cases and their total cost varies considerably
 agar aap credit card kaa upyog aksar badi kharidon ke liye karte hai to behatar hoga ki aap na chukaaye ja sake bakaayon ko iemi main badalawaane kii laagton par bhi dhyaan den

 "it may also happen that on a credit card showing a lower interest rate, you may have to pay a higher processing fee than others (see graphic)

 However, their interest rate is not the same

 Shiv Sena is sitting on the chair of Chief Minister with the support of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress
 vahiin bijepi wet and watch kii sthiti main he
 When the results of the Maharashtra assembly elections were announced on October 24, everyone felt that the BJP and Shiv Sena would easily form the government
 288 siton par chunaav hue the, jisamen bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 siten milin
 The magic figure of a majority in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is 146
 aise main agar bijepi or shivasena kii siton ko mila diya jaae to aankada 161 baithta he
 In such a situation, hardly anyone would have thought that the BJP and Shiv Sena would be separated
 donon partiyon ne 2014 main alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 But even then no one had got majority
 sharad pavaar ko sonia kaa ek kol
 
 
 And after the stuck government in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena joined the NDA and formed the government in Maharashtra
 is baar donon partiyon ne saath milakar chunaav ladaa
 But instead of advantages, both seats decreased
 baavjood iske shivasena-bijepi ke paas itani siten thim ki ve aasaani se sarkaar bana len
 This was probably the first time in Indian politics, when the Grand Alliance did not form a government despite being a figure worth forming
 shivasena jahaan 50-50 formule ke rukh par kaayam he
 At the same time, BJP does not want to compromise on the post of Chief Minister
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki mukhyamantri pad dhai-dhai saal ke liye baantnaa chahie
 But BJP said that no such situation was reached
 iske baad 30 saal puraani dosti main daraar pad gai or shivasena ke tevar talkh hote gaye
 Uddhav Thackeray stepped up efforts to form a government with other parties outside the BJP
 rajyapal ne diya shivasena ko jhatka, sarkaar gathan ke liye or samay dene se inkaarphilhal alam ye he ki nattejey aane ke 18 din baad bhi ab tak maharashtra main mukhyamantri kii kursi khaali padi he
 On Monday also, there was a round of meetings and discussions in the state's council throughout the day
 kabhi sonia ne pavaar se baat kii to kabhi uddhav ne
 As the day progressed, Shiv Sena leader Aditya Thackeray met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and expressed his desire to form the government
 lekin unhen congress kii ore se jhatka laga
 There was news in the day that the Congress is ready to support the Shiv Sena from outside
 baithkon se lekar sarkaar banane ke nyote tak, puure din chalaa siyasat kaa 'power play'magar baad main congress ne kaha ki philhal shivasena ko koi samarthan patr nahin diya gaya he
 Now again Congress will talk to NCP
 iske baad governor ne ensipi ko bhi sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya or raat ko ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ne uddhav thakare ko phone kiya or kaha ki ve shivasena sang sarkaar banane ko taiyaar hai
 But for this, the support of Congress is also necessary

 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday approached a special PMLA court in Mumbai demanding that liquor baron Vijay Mallya be declared a fugitive
 ek kathith bank karj farjivade ke maamle main maalya ke khilaaf kii ja rahi dhanshodhan kii jaanch ke silsile main idi ne unhen bhagoda ghoshit karne kii maang kii he
 Officials said that the agency has requested the court to pass an order under Section 82 of the crpc to declare Mallya an absconder as there are 'too many' arrest warrants pending against him
 isamen dhanshodhan rokthaam kanoon (piemele) ke tahat jari kiya gaya ek gaiyr-jamaanti varrent bhi shaamil he
 He said that the court can pass the order on June 13 on the ed's plea
 adhikariyon ne bataaya, ' maalya ke khilaaf vibhinn maamalon main bahut saare giraftaar varrent lambit pade hai
 There is also a case of check bounce in them and they are also looking for money laundering
 agency ne maamle kii jaanch kii sthiti se adaalat ko avgat kara diya he or maalya ko jaanch main shaamil hone kii jarurat he
 He told that in this case the same special PMLA court of Mumbai has been taken which had issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya in the past
 ullekhneey he ki kisi aapraadhik maamle main koi adaalat kisi vyakti ko tabhi bhagoda ghoshit karti he jab adaalat ke paas yah yakeen karne kii vajahen hon ki jis aaropee ke khilaaf usne giraftaar varrent jari kiya tha, vah faraar ho chukaa he yaa apane aap ko chupa rahaa he taaki varrent taamil na karaayaa ja sake
 Under Section 82 of the crpc, the court can publish a written declaration in which the accused can be asked to appear at a particular place at a particular time within 30 days of the publication of such declaration
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki yadi maalya siarpisi kii dhara 82 ke tahat shuru kii gai kaarywahi kaa paalan nahin karte hai to agency ke paas siarpisi kii dhara 83 ke tahat faraar vyakti kii sampatti kurk karne kaa bhi vikalp he
 Apart from this, the ED is also preparing to attach Mallya's assets worth Rs 1,400 crore under PMLA
 ullekhneey he ki maalya apane rajanyik passport kaa istemaal karte hue do march ko bharat chhodkar chale gaye the
 Based on an FIR filed by the CBI last year, the ED has registered a money laundering case against Mallya and others

 adhikariyon ne kaha ki agency ne adaalat se anurodh kiya he ki vah siarpisi kii dhara 82 ke tahat ek aadesh paarit kar maalya ko bhagoda ghoshit kar de, kyonki unke khilaaf 'bahut saare' giraftaar varrent lambit hai
 It also includes a non-bailable warrant issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
 unhone bataaya ki adaalat idi kii arji par 13 june ko aadesh paarit kar sakati he
 Officials said, "A lot of arrest warrants are pending against Mallya in various cases
 unamem check bouns kaa bhi ek maamla he or dhanshodhan ke maamle main bhi unki talash he

 ' unhone bataaya ki is maamle main mumbai kii usee vishesh piemele adaalat kaa rukh kiya gaya he jisane pichley dinon maalya ke khilaaf gaiyr-jamaanti varrent jari kiya tha 
 It is worth mentioning that in a criminal case, a court declares a person to be a fugitive only if the court has reasons to believe that the accused against whom he had issued an arrest warrant has escaped or is hiding himself So that the warrant cannot be served
 siarpisi kii dhara 82 ke tahat adaalat ek likhit ghoshnaa prakashit kar sakati he jisamen aaropee ko aisi ghoshnaa ke prakaashan ke 30 dinon ke bheetar ek khaas samay par ek khaas jagah par pesh hone ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Officials said that if Mallya does not follow the proceedings initiated under Section 82 of the crpc, the agency also has the option to attach the property of the absconding person under Section 83 of the crpc
 iske alaava idi, piemele ke tahat maalya kii 1,400 karod rupee kii sampatti kurk karne kii taiyaari main bhi he
 It is noteworthy that Mallya left India on 2 March using his diplomatic passport

 centre evam rajya ke police balon ke bich yah takaraav kii abhootpurv sthiti thi
 Mamta, who was playing a leading role in efforts to form an anti-bjp alliance ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, claimed that the CBI knocked on Kolkata Police Commissioner Kumar's door without a search warrant
 mamata ne aarope lagaaya ki ve har us rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagaana chaahate hai, jahaan vipakshi partiyaan satta main hai
 The Trinamool Congress supremo said, 'I can assure it

 unhone kaha ki sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko maan lenaa chahie ki 40 saal main pehali baar lokapal ke mudde par koi vidheyak sansad main charchaa ke str par pahunchaa he
 Bansal dismissed the speculation that the Congress has issued a three-line whip asking all mps to be present in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday because it is nervous
 unhone kaha ki yah ek vidhisangat prakriya he
 However, the BJP made it clear that it will not back down on its proposal for amendments and it is the responsibility of the government to make a broad consensus by making necessary amendments

 Pending cases
 hoicourt main philhal 71,000 maamle apni sunwaayee kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been advocating for the last 35 years, says that when the 80-year-old tells the court that he has been cessing for the last 20-25 years, the case should be concluded soon after taking into consideration his age
 Your heirs are present, they will definitely benefit from the decision of the court, the situation of our justice system is like this at the moment
 faislon par asarajajon kii sankhya aadhi he lihaaja sidhe taur par aane vaale faislon par iskaa asar dikhataa he
 Often, cases have to be completed by the judges quickly and sometimes the hearing date is found after one year, due to which not only the lawyers are under pressure but it also has a bad effect on the functioning of the judges
 vakil pankaj gupta kehete he ki jaise-jaise jaj or vakil kii diary main cese badhate jate hai, pressure apane aap doguna hota jaataa he
 If as a lawyer, my capacity is to handle four cases a day, but if i have to handle 10 cases then the pressure will definitely increase

 Shashank Dev, who has been an advocate for almost two decades, says that when there are no judges, then think about how justice will be done, how cases will be heard and how early settlement is possible in the case

 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii adhyaksh mayawati ne is puure maamle ko lekar prashasan ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Mayawati said that the lax attitude of the administration is unnecessarily blaming the matter
 kuch logon dwaara shiksha ko dharm or jati kii ati-raajnneeti se jodne ke kaaran upje is vivaad ko katai uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 The BSP president said that the appointment of a Muslim Sanskrit scholar as its teacher by BHU would be considered to be the right patronage for Talent and no one should be allowed to do any work that would demoralize in this regard
 mayawati ne kaha ki sarkaar isapar dhyaan de to behatar hoga

 If this appointment was made as a Sanskrit teacher in any other department of the university, there would be no opposition
 yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki sanskrit vidya koi bhi kisi bhi dharm kaa vyakti pard or padhaa saktaa he, lekin dharm vigyaan kii baat jab koi duusare dharm kaa vyakti kare to vishwasaneeyata nahin rah jaati
 Feroze Khan is having difficulty in being appointed as a Muslim, Assistant Professor Feroz Khan says, My father Ramzan Khan has taken the title of Shastri in Sanskrit

 In today's voting, we saw that about 68 percent people were in favor of giving this highest honor to Sachin
 lekin lagbhag 32 pratishat logon kaa isse asahmati jataana bhi myne rakhata he
 He also found much for the achievements of Sachin Tendulkar in the playground
 unhen bharat ke sabase priy khilaadi ke rup main bharpoor prashansa to mili hi, akut daulat bhi mili
 He became a brand that has no match in the world of sports
 har badi company sachin se apane brand kaa endorasment chaahati thi or uske liye munhmaange paise dene ko taiyaar rahati thi
 As a result, Sachin Tendulkar became one of the most wealthy players in the world
 forbs patrika ne sachin ko duniya ke sabase dhani khilaadiyon kii suchi main 51 wein sthaan par rakhaa he
 Meaning that he did not get less than what Sachin gave to the country

 Of these, 101 goals were scored in the Olympic Games
 dhyaan chand ke khel ko dekhakar sari duniya hairaan rah gai
 Don't know how many people praised him
 cricket ke shaukeenon ko jaanakar hairaani hogi ki khud don breadman ne dhyaan chand kaa khel dekhakar kaha ki wo to ran banane kii tarah gol daagate hai
 He won the honor of India after winning many important wins in international hockey tournaments
 itani sari uplabdhiyon ke baavjood dhyanchand ko vah sammaan nahin mil sakaa, jiske vah hakdaar the
 He neither sought nor respected wealth
 vah dhan ke abhaav main rahe, beemaari se peedit rahe or kisi ne unki taraf dekha nahin, jabaki videshon main unki dhooma machi rahi, austria main unki adamkad pratimaa lagaai gai or england main unke naam par ek stesan kaa naam bhi rakhaa gaya
 He selflessly served hockey and continued to teach hockey to children even after retirement
 bharat maa ke is sapoot ko bharat ratna dene ke sabhi kaaran maujuud hai
 The government did well by giving Bharat Ratna to Sachin in due course of time, but he should not forget Dhyanchand's magnificent achievements

 She said that she would take any action only when the ministry brought a court order
 udhar, sarkaar ke is rukh se internet premiyon main aisi site par pratibandh lagane kii ashanka balwati ho gai
 Voices have also started raising against it
 rajyasabha saansad va udyogpati rajeev chandrashekhar ne kaha, ki sibbal bharat main internet par niyantran kaa chini model lagu karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But he will not succeed in it
 vahiin, jammu evam kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah online samagriyon par pratibandh ke khilaaf hai lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa aksar durupyog kiya jaataa he

 This was observed in new research where 23 to 33 per cent of women in an online study admitted that they were engaged in 'foodie calls'

 pradhanmantri narendra modiki mahatvakankshi bullate train pariyojna japan ke sahyog se banaai jaani he
 For this, there have been important agreements between the governments of both countries, but recently there has been a big steel scandal in Japan
 is scandle main saamne aayaa he ki japan kii bullate train ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaala steel tay maanakon ke mutabik nahin he
 This has raised the question whether it will have any effect on the Modi government's dream project mumbai-ahmedabad bullet train or not
 kobi steel par lage hai aropadarasal japan kii companykobi steelalimited par bullate train ke liye ghatiya maal khapaane kaa aarope laga he
 The company has feared that something may have been tampered with at the research center at Coby Steel
 company kii taraf se bheje gaye steel ko adhomanak paaya gaya
 After the news came in the media, the management of the company has also apologized for it
 suraksha ko koi khatra nahincentral japan railwayur yahaan bullate train kaa sanchaalan karne vaali companiyon ne haalanki saaf kiya he ki isse suraksha ko koi khatra nahin he
 Steel sent by the company has not met the standards
 japan sarkaar philhal is maamle kii jaanch main juty he
 How worrying for India, India's first bullet train is being built in collaboration with Japan
 aise main japan main bullate train se judaa scandle saamne ke aane ke baad bharat main bhi charchaa shuru hone lagi he
 Questions are beginning to arise here as to what effect this scam may have on India
 haalanki bharat kii bullate train project pariyojna main japan ke sahyeg ko dekhen, to iskaa koi asar is par padataa nahin dikh rahaa he
 Focus on Make in India Japan is providing technology and financial support to prepare India's first bullet train
 bhartiya bullate train kaa khaakaa bhi japan ne hi taiyaar kiya he
 However, the parts and other items used to make bullet trains will be made indigenously
 bharat sarkaar iske jariye 'mek in india' campeinn ko badhaava dena chaahati he
 In such a situation, any impact of this scandal of Kobi on India is negligible
 asurakshit nahin, adhomanak kii he shikayatjapan main saamne aae is ghotaale kii baat karen, to isamen company par aarope he ki unhone bullate train ke liye jo steel istemaal kiya, vah adhomanak he
 Companies operating the bullet train have made it clear that this will not affect the safety of the bullet train
 bharat ke paas kai hai vikalpaise main agar bhavishya main bharat sarkaar japan se steel mangati bhi he, to kobi ke alaava kai badi japani companiyaan hai, jinase vah steel le sakati he
 Other companies, including JFE Holdings, account for more than 75% of Japan's steel industry
 kobi steel is industry kaa ek chota sa hissaa he
 Japan's track record is better, so far there is a record of bullet train running in Japan that no accident has happened due to this
 jiskaa sidhaa matlab he ki yahaan kii bullate train ke suraksha maanak kaaphi kade hai
 The first bullet train to run in India is also due to Japanese technology
 aise main japan kaa trek record dekhte hue is takanic par bharosa jataayaa ja saktaa he

 Sri Lanka and Pakistan will compete in the ICC World Cup 2011 on Saturday
 apane pehle match main canada ko 210 ranon se haraane ke baad srilanka ke hausale buland hai
 Sri Lanka, who consider themselves as title contenders, will take on Pakistan at the Premadasa Stadium on Saturday
 yah uskaa doosraa muqabla hoga
 Pakistan has also made its World Cup debut in a spectacular manner
 usne hambantota ke usee maidan par kenya ko 23 farvari ko 205 ranon se haraaya tha, jis par srilanka ne ranon ke lihaaj se vishwa cap main paanchavin sabase badi jeet darj kii thi
 This match between the two teams will entertain the spectators, as both are strong and at the same time are striving to give their full strength for the second title win in the World Cup
 pakistan ne kenya ke khilaaf vishwastareey khel dikhaate hue pehle 300 ranon se adhik kaa score khadaa kiya or phir use 112 ranon par dher kar diya
 Sri Lanka also put the opposition team to 122 after scoring a score of over 300 against Canada
 ab tak ke pradarshan ke lihaaj se donon tiimon ko barabari kaa darja diya ja saktaa he, lekin santulan ke lihaaj se srilanka kaa palada thodaa baari he
 Sri Lanka will get a lot of support from the domestic audience in this match
 is match ke liye srilanka main sarvaadhik sankhya main darshakon ke umadane kii ummid he
 While Sri Lanka will depend on Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan and captain Kumar Sangakkara to score a century in the first match in batting, in bowling it will have confidence in Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara and star spinner Muttiah Muralitharan
 pakistan ne damdaar ballebaaji ke baad behtareen gendbaaji karke match apane naam kiya tha
 Pakistan will once again attempt to score big on the strength of Kamran Akmal, Younis Khan, Umar Akmal and misbah-ul-haq, while bowling it relies on the spin of skipper Shahid Afridi, who took five wickets against Umar Gul, Shoaib Akhtar and Kenya
 Have to stay
 group-e se australia, newjiland, srilanka or pakistan kaa antim-8 main pahunchnaa tay mana ja rahaa he, lekin pakistan or srilanka kaa prayaas lagaataar jeet kaa lay banaae rakhte hue talika main sabase upree sthaan paanaa hoga, kyonki isse quarter final main unka saamana group-bi main apekshaakrit lachar pradarshan karne vaali tiimon se hoga
 There is a possibility of rain for this match
 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki colombo main shanivaar ko badal chhaae rahenge, jabaki adhiktam taapmaana 30 degree centegrade or nunatam taapmaana 24 degree centegrade bana rahegaa
 With a 20 percent chance of rain, both teams will win the toss and bat first to make full use of the power-play, so that if the match is decided based on the duckworth-lewis rule after the rain, then their upper hand remains heavy
 bhartiya team landan ke ovel main 11 june, 2017 ko champions trophy ke semi-final main jagah banane ke liye dakshin africa ke khilaaf asal main nokout match khel rahi thi
 Two days ago, she had lost the match against Sri Lanka at the same ground, who had no hope of winning
 so, ab karo yaa maro kaa muqabla tha
 a lot was at stake in this match against the world's number one ODI team and as if this pressure does not come down, there was a furore in the media clash between the captain and the coach (anil Kumble)
 captain viraat kohli ke liye match kii baari ahmiyat thi
 India won this match easily due to the sharp bowling
 or bharat ke ran chej kii jimmedaari viraat ne apane kandhon par uthaai, jaisaa puure saal ve aksar karte rahe the, or naabad 76 ranon par match khatm karke hi laute
 This simple victory had no effect on the captain — he was not a man to be swept away in a flood of accolades
 june 2017 kii 18 taarikh, ovel, landan
 India had lost the Champions Trophy to Pakistan and Virat Kohli returned to the pavilion without scoring any runs
 match khatm hone ke kuch hi pal baad soshal media par kohli ko trol kiya jane laga or agbabula fai na tamaam kism kii gaali-galouj karne lage
 He was so much cursed for being so badly degrading
 is haar se unase zyada koi dukhi nahin tha, par ek dashak se zyada vakt se sabase oonche str par cricket khelte aa rahe kohli ke liye apane prashansakon kaa pyaar or nafrat koi nai baat nahin thi
 They knew very well that in India, cricketers are beheaded like a deity one day and tortured like a devil the next day
 pataa yah chalaa ki champions trophy viraat ke liye ek apwaad bhar thi, us saal jo vaise unke liye shandaar rahaa tha
 The 2,818 international runs in the 2017 calendar are the third highest in history so far — and just 46 runs short of the record by Kumar Sangakkara (2,868 runs, in 2014); He has won nine consecutive series as captain, one after the other; And has scored over 200 runs six times in the last 17 months
 khel ke sabhi formet main oonche ausat ke alaava maidan par unki karaamaat or dabadabe kaa sabase pakkaa saboot yah he ki ve kam overon ke donon formet kii isisi ranking main pehle number par kabiz hai or test main nan
 At 2 (after Steve Smith of Australia)
 ise acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye yah bataanaa kaaphi hoga ki duniya kaa koi bhi ballebaaj teenon formet ke isisi top 5 main shumaar nahin he
 The rift between the captain and the coach has been forgotten and the year ends with a grand wedding like a fairytale
 viraat kohli kaa kayapalatperth, janvari 2012
 The Australians, as they often do, were able to continuously repel Virat
 ve darshakon kii chhedchhad se tang aa chuke the or tabhi unka muqabla karne ke liye ghatiya tareeke par utar aaeh bheed ke khaas taur par shor machaa rahe ek hisse kii taraf se unhen ''wankar" (neech yaa ghinauna) kaha gaya, to unhone bhi jawaab main apni bich kii ungali dikhaa di
 Unable to handle anger was the hallmark of the early Kohli and it was expressed concern that it might become a hindrance to the path of this promising blossom
 do maheene bitate-bitate kahani puri tarah badal gai
 Kohli scored a match-winning 183 in the match against Pakistan in Dhaka
 yah match aadhi raat se kuch pehle hi khatm hua
 The media was present in large numbers and was waiting for Kohli's soundbite before sending his report of the match
 mirpur main press conference kii jagah pavilion ke bilkul saamne kii taraf thi or media ke ahaate main pahunchane ke liye puraa maidan paar karnaa padataa he
 On the way to the media center, Virat suddenly stopped on the way, turned and started running slowly towards a part of his fans in the stand
 koi 2,000 darshak match ke baad bhi ruke hue the or ab bhi puure utsaah se ''kohli, kohli" chilla rahe the
 Many were surprised to see that Virat decided to get his Muraids with photographs and autographs before turning to the media
 beshak, unhen acchhee tarah pataa tha ki ve kya kar rahe hai or press conference ke kamare main daakhil hote hi unhone vahaan ikattha media ke logon se maafee bhi maangi
 The metamorphosis had begun
 maidan kii us aakraamak shakhsiyat par ab ek nai paripakvata, ek nayaa dhairya or sanyam paradaa daalata maaloom detaa tha
 After playing his 200th Test and his last international match in November 2013, Sachin Tendulkar was sitting in the dressing room of the Wankhede Stadium, disposed of alone, about the moment
 to lijie khud sachin kii jubaani suniye ki uske baad kya hua, ''jab main dressing room main baitha tha, to dekha ki viraat meri taraf chale aa rahe hai
 When he came close to me, i saw that he had tears in his eyes and he extended a gift towards me
 jaahir he, yah koi aisi cheez thi jo unke dil ke bahut kareeb thi
 He said it was given to him by his dad (a family legacy for good fortune) and he always wondered who he would hand it over
 main awak rah gaya ki unhone mujhe itane durlabh sammaan ke laayak samajha
 We hugged, my belligerents tied up and i told Virat that you should leave before i start crying
 "yah kayapalat 2016-17 aate-aate puraa ho chukaa tha, jab viraat ne khel ke teenon formet main captaini puri tarah sambhaal lee
 He was still a person who took iron and gave a rude reply
 unhen australia ke captain ko bagaiyr in shabdon kaa istemaal kiye dhoort or beyimaan kehane main koi jhijak nahin hui or na hi em
 s
 dhoni kii aalochana karne or team main unki jagah par sawaal uthaane ke liye media ko lalkaarane main koi dar mahasoos hua
 This man enjoys the unconditional loyalty of his team and support staff
 rukhsat ho rahe coach anil kumble ke katu or tikhe lafjon se ve halkaan nahin hue or na hi soshal media par kumble kii vidaai se upji tikhi pratikriyaaon ne unki neend haraam kii
 He was very careful and fit when he said to me, "I have to take responsibility for my work, just like i take credit for my success
" 
 
 media ko bhi apana kaam karnaa hota he
 They have a right to criticize me
 bhartiya cricket team kaa captain hone ke naate meraa kaam apni behtareen kaabiliyat se team kii aguai karnaa he
 As long as i am truthful about my work and every time i lead India well, i do not care about what is being written and said about me
 main jaanata hum ki main kitni kadi mehnat karata hum or jab tak meri taiyaari us tarah chalati he jaisi main chahta hum, to nattejey jarur aaenge
 “it is a tremendous confidence in itself
 kuch log galati se ise gurur samaj lete hai
 But this is also the key to understanding Virat's office
 yah, or vah bhi jise tendulkar apana ''haashiye kaa vijan" kehete hai, ''vah game ko bahut shandaar tareeke se pard saktaa he or pehle se andaaj laga letaa he ki khel main aage kya hone vaala he
 This is what sets him apart from others
 " sachin apni pari ko bahut baariki or sahi raftaar se aage badhaane ke alaava ek kism se cricket main durandeshi hone kaa shrey unhen de rahe ho sakate hai
 He adds, "that's why he is so good in the run chase
" vah samaj letaa he ki yah match kahaan ja saktaa he, jisase use apni takat ko sahi jagah lagane main madad milti he
 "this marginal vision was also reflected brilliantly when India chased down Australia's huge total runs in the World T20 match in Mohali on 27 March 2016 and Sri Lanka in Kolkata on 16-20 November 2017
 Even in the first Test against
 mohali main viraat ne, unke hamawatan ravichandran aswin ke lafjon main, ''australian total kaa mukammal dhang se peechha kiya" or kolkata main us pich par, jo unke gendbaajon ke liye mushkil thi, shatak lagaakar match kaa rukh tay kar diya
 One of the brightest stars in the Indian cricket sky, and the fastest (52 matches) to record 300 Test wickets, Ashwin says, "it is as if he was a mathematician who graced the stadium grid
" Kind of know
 unhen pataa he ki gap kahaan hai or chej karte vakt ve mukammal dhang se raftaar badhaate jate hai
 They are role models for most of us
 "viraat kohli ke ek or mureed saurabh ganguli ke liye viraat or baakiyon main din kii roshni kaa fark he
 He says, "in Test cricket, Steve Smith may be a little ahead, but when you see all the formats of the game, it's Virat Kohli
" " unke hisaab se viraat ko batting karte dekhnaa khud ko daavat dene kii tarah he, saurabh kehete hai, ''ve us kism ke khilaadi hai jo phens ko test cricket kii taraf waapas le aayega
 "revealing his mastery over many formats," says Saurabh, "look at his shot selection closely
 ve kabhi slog nahin karte
 Even when they lift the ball high, it is a traditional cricketing shot
 aap unhen falls stroke khelte hue mushkil se hi kabhi dekhenge kyonki ve sahajata se ran banaate hai or tamaam formet main teji se score khadaa karte hai, ve kabhi dabaav main nahin aate
 And they score fast, so the bowler is always under pressure while throwing the ball to them
 pes or spin donon ke saath ve bahut sahaj hai
 The bounce does not make them difficult, as they can play pull shots
 mujhe lagata he, ve dakshin africa main bhi kaamyaab honge
 "one of the finest cricketers himself, David Warner says," His confidence makes him distinct and special
 agar ve 350 bhi chej kar rahe hon, to ve jaanate hai ki ve kuch hi overon main match kaa rukh badal sakate hai or dabaav main nahin aate hai
 The person who has scored 50 international centuries in just nine years will be a very good player
 "badhata kad, fitness kaa kaarobaaraviraat kii viraasat ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa ja chukaa he, ki unamem fitness ko lekar kisi deewangi he
 The current Indian team is obviously the best team in the world in all formats of the field in terms of fielding, with Virat's fitness mantra becoming a philosophy of life for this young team
 har duusare din vah soshal media par apni workout kii tasviir saajha karte hai or dressing room main sab unka anusaran karte hai
 Their standards in fitness are not just cricketers, and they seem to be equivalent to Cristino Ronaldo or Justin Gatin, or Weyde Van Neckerk or Gareth Ballet
 unhone apane niyam bana rakhe hai, jisamen saare bhartiya cricketron ke liye yo yo andurence test anivaary he
 Virat now wants the whole country to be with him in this journey of fitness
 november main puma ke saath apni spotrs or lifestil company van8 kii shuruyaat karte hue unhone kaha tha, ''ham logon ko baahar nikalakar khilne or khud par garv karne ke liye raji kar saken, to ham bharat ko swasth bana sakate hai
 “rs 100 crore for eight years
 ke is saude ne viraat ke bheetar ke kaarobaari ko bhi baahar laa diya
 He denied Cola's advertisement saying he was not confident in this "product", perhaps because it did not match his theory of fitness, despite Virat today 14
 4 karod dollar ke saath bharat kaa sabase bada brand hai or unhen ek-do saal ke liye kiye jane vaale karaaron par bharosa nahin he
 "long engagement means they can influence the brand's publicity and shape the product based on their point of view," says a top Indian brand expert
 " ve jaanate hai ki khel main kariyar chota hota he, jisamen kuch hi behtareen pal hote hai
 
 is lihaaj se ve apane maujuuda prabhaav kaa sahi tareeke se istemaal kar rahe hai
 Assessing the current situation, idealists are strengthening their hold on the promotion of Virat products, which means preferring their choice and rejecting lucrative offers
 apane antarrashtriya kariyar kii sandhyavela main chal rahe dhoni ke saath unke vyavhaar main sankoch or nishpakshta jhalkati he
 Whenever the media attacks the former captain, Virat comes forward to defend him
 8 november ko press conference main ve baras pade, ''main nahin samaj paa rahaa hum ki kyon emesadi ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 "saurabh says," It's different from what i saw
 mujhe yah dekhakar acha lagata he ki viraat kis tarah se dhoni kaa bachaav karte hai
 "the famous marriage and new life is a celebrity today and she has drawn a clear line between her personal and professional life
 italy ke tuskeni heritage resort main apni shaadi ke shandaar, lekin nijee samaaroh ke unke faisle or is puure aayojan main media kii pahunch simit rakhane se lekar patibaddhta jataane ke unke tareeke tak main isaki jhalak dikhi
 After the wedding they opened their doors to countless fans and media: the two media appearances in Delhi and Mumbai made up for the media's absence in Italy
 apni ballebaaji kii tarah apni jindagi main bhi viraat samay kaa khaasaa kchayaal rakhte hai
 They got married at the end of a year of achievement, when the captain and coach's controversy was left behind, anyway, this year has proved to be the most successful year of their professional life so far and how could this year's farewell be better than this 
 nae saal main kathin chunautiyaan saamne hai
 Despite the achievements, the true story of Virat is yet to be revealed
 dakshin africa, england or australia ke dauron main kisi ek main bhi mili jeet unke aasapaas aparajeyata kaa aabhamandal rach degi
 Does Virat realize the challenges? Do they know how severe the failure can be in the next 12 months? From two reports in late October 2017, in which a lot was written about Kohli, i came to know that he is aware of this
 ek report kohli ke duniya kaa sheersh spotrs brand banane se sambandhit thi, to duusari report abhinetri or unki saajheedaar anoushka sharma se unke sambhavit vivaah par kendrit thi
 Interestingly in both cases, whatever Kohli does, he was justified
 beshak, ve kuch kehete hai yaa karte hai, to vah khabar ban jaati he
 So when it was learned that he could marry Anushka, it was breaking news for all the media
 or kuch dinon main hi pataa chalaa ki kohli ne bharat ke sabase keemtee brand ke rup main shahrukh khan ko bedakhal kar diya
 a lot is at stake and Kohli knows the high and low of his business
 kohli ke bare main abhi bahut kuch likhaa janaa he
 Five years later, will he be India's greatest batsman and most prolific captain or will he fall as autocratic who treated Kumble like Kivandati? Does it matter to them how we see them? What does Kohli really care about as a person? i guess they are not like that in reality
 aisa lagata he ki ve samay ko puraa jite hai, apane gym main, apane prashikshan main, apni shaadi main or 22 gaj kii pich par
 My assessment is that they will not let the publicity agreements worth crores of rupees go
 unhen apni jimmedaariyon kaa ehsaas he, ve jab ballebaaji karte hai yaa abhyaas kar rahe hote hai to puri tarah se ekagra hote hai
 As if there were some human robots
 gujarey dinon ke ol rounder ian batham kehete hai, ''viraat main acchhee baat he ki ve jeetne ke liye khelte hai
 Whatever the circumstances, they would like to win the match
 yahi baat unhen khaas banaati he
 " duniya ghoomane ke shaukeen hai to aapako aapako in saat shaharon kaa aakarshan jarur apni ore khinch legaa
 There is no shortage of beauty and litigants in every corner of the world

 Almost every political party from the ruling party reaches to eat food for the Dalits for their political gains, but the condition of Dalits in the country is that in Patan, Gujarat, Dalit activist Bhanubhai Vankar had to take the path of self-immolation
 2018 ke abhi 2 maheene bhi nahin gujarey hai or desh ke vibhinn hisson se daliton par atyaachaar kii darjanon khabaren akhabaaron ko syah kar chuki hai
 Let's look at some of the popular cases of Dalit oppression so far this year: a Dalit girl was burnt alive in Unnao
