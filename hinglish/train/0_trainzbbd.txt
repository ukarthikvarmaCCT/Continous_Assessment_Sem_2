 Janata Dal (united) spokesperson and Legislative Councilor Neeraj Kumar has said that 'seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha elections in the Grand Alliance is not so easy

 Speaking to NDTV, Neeraj Kumar said that Lalu Prasad is the president of RJD, the principal party of the Ghatak Dal and has a history of political life that even when he was the Railway Minister, he took land in Patna to give hotel contract
 
 yahi nahin railway main naukari dene ke naam par garib logon se bhi jameen likhavai gai

 aise main aane vaale chunaav main tikataarthiyon ko tathaa mahagathbandhan main shaamil ghatak dalon ke netaaon ko bhi jameen or sampatti kaa agreement taiyaar kar unase milanaa hoga
 Neeraj claimed that the seat-sharing in the Grand Alliance was not due to Kharmas but to the bargaining of property and land

 Savarna reservation, this is the reservation of the general class
 ham iske lagu karne ke tareeke kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Without any investigation, commission, survey and survey, they amended the constitution in just a few hours
 ham garib savarnon ke paksh main hai
 The fate of this reservation implemented in haste will be similar to demonetisation
 hamaare palatu chachaa ko hi dekh lijiye
 Nitish Kumar bounced and decided to support the Gold Reservation in a hurry
 ab rajd ke stand kaa sharmaate-sharmaate samarthan kar rahe hai
 After a few days, we will openly support our demand because the public is the owner
 wo unhen majaboor kar degi
 We had been demanding for so long, did not increase our ceiling but gave them here without asking
 kyonki unhen aapke vot se dar nahin lagata
 We are questioning the method of this reservation
 bataaiye 8 lakh salanaa kamaane vaala yani maheene ke 66,666 ru kamaane vaala garib kaise hua? centre sarkaar kii ajeeb ganit he bhai? agar aap salanaa 8 lakh kamaate hai to aapako 20 fisadi tex dena padataa he
 That means you have to pay tax of Rs 72,500 annually for earning 8 lakhs annually and Modi ji says they are poor
 bataaiye jo vyakti 72,500 rupee tex sarkaar ko detaa he, sarkaar use aarakshan de rahi he
 Modi ji, who has 5 acres of land, ie 160 kathas i
e
 8 bighas of land, is also poor
 or unhen aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan milanaa chahie
 Please tell
 
 
 aarakshan virdohi pehle merit-merit chillaate the ab bahut kush hai
 His dualism will not work
 yaa to aap ye maniye ki aap jativaadee hai, isliye qaabil, yogya or pratibhashali dalit-pichhadon ko kaatane main lage hai or unhen pratinidhitiv nahin de sakate
 Or assume that he is the biggest reservation officer
 aap dusron kii hakmaari bhi karenge or varna-vyavastha main khud ko dusron se shreshth bhi samajhenge
 Will also disdain others
 unki jaat kaa majaak bhi banaaenge
 Will exploit but will not give the right to equality
 unki jati kii bhi gananaa nahin karenge or naa hi hone denge
 And we will not even count our caste because your poll will reveal how a handful of people have captured all areas and resources of the country on the basis of ethnic muscle power and fraud
 desh ke 52% OBC ko 27% rigerveshan dene ke liye mandal kamishan bana 1978 main
 The report came in 1980
 lagu hone kii ghoshnaa hui 1990 main
 Came into force in 1993
 vah bhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main 2008 main lagu ho paaya
 How much movement took place, how many bloodshed, how many people ate sticks, all of them cannot be imagined
 ab bhi puri tarah se obisi aarakshan lagu nahin hua he
 No commission was made to give 10% reservation to 15% gold and reservation was given in 72 hours
 desh main SC / ST ko puraani janaganana ke mutabiq, aabaadi ke anupaat main 22
 5% similar reservation was given but today the population of Dalits has also increased, so SC / ST reservation should also increase
 ham isaki purazor maang kar ladaai kaa elaan karte hai
 According to the 1931 census, the backward population was 52%
 lekin pichhadon ko azaadi ke 46 saal baad 1993 main maatr 27% hi aarakshan mila
 In 2008, after 61 years of reservation in higher education, that too, Modi's Manuwadi government ended two days ago
 hamaari maang he ki pichhadon ko kam se kam aaj se 88 saal pehle yani 1931 kii pichhadon kii jansankhya (52%) ke hisaab se to kam se kam 52% to aarakshan milanaa chahie
 And then after the ethnic census it should be increased in ethnic proportion
 hamaari maang he ki atipichhadon ko 40% aarakshan mili
 Today we announce a new movement 'unemployment remove, increase reservation'
 
 
 'jaateey janaganana karwaao or jaateey anupaat main aarakshan badhaao
 Increase reservation of SC / ST and OBC to 90% in the country
 nijee kshetra main aarakshan lagu karo'
 
 
 On what basis are these people changing caste reservation into economic reservation? Based on which report, commission and survey? If today we and you do not oppose tampering with the Constitution, then Baba saheb and the coming generations will not forgive us! If your MP is backward and Dalit, do not let him enter your area, because he has increased the reservation for you and Bahujans
 Did not demand
 aise kaayar or darpok log aapke saansad banane ke laayak nahin hai
 If they cannot raise their voice in your party for your entitlements, then such mps are damned
 desh main jitne bhi dalit-pichde saansad hai unka boycott kiya jaae
 They should not be allowed to enter the area
 unase sawaal-jawaab kiya jaae

 Reddy told reporters here, 'I think we can send a notice but until we get an opinion from the Law Ministry about this, i cannot say anything clearly about it
 ’tippaniyan The Ministry of Petroleum and its technical unit Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) have alleged that the reason for the reduction in production from the KG-D6 area is to dig a limited number of wells against the plan

 ' nayaa raipur main taiyaar khadaa nayaa mantralay bhawan gulzaar nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Reason: a Pyramid
 200 karod ru
 The building was to be inaugurated on 16 April but the pyramid being built to suit the ministry was not ready
 isliye kaarykram taal diya gaya
 Raman Singh government wanted to start functioning in the new ministry from the second week of April
 varisht iees adhikari bi
 L
 agarwal or unki team ne puure mantralay ko nae bhawan main shift karne kii sari taiyaari bhi kar lee thi
 The five floors of the building were ready, the names of ministers and officials were also listed in the ministerial block
 lekin, jaisaa ki sutara bataate hai, isi bich ek jyotishi ne mukhyamantri dow
 Raman Singh told that there is a Vastu defect in the new building of the ministry
 jisase yahaan adhikariyon kaa kaam main man nahin lagegaa or bhaajapa sarkaar kaa pradarshan bhi kharaab ho jayega
 Sources reveal that the construction work started as soon as the astrologer predicted the evil and suggested a way to build a pyramid to avoid it
 raman singh kehete hai, ''janata ke aashirwad ke saath vaastu bhi acha hona jaruri he
 Vastushastra will prove useful in the development of the state

 maje kii baat to yah he ki mantralay kaa jo nakshaa paas hua he usamen pyramid kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 But there was no budget problem in its construction and there was no problem in completing other formalities including maps
 haalanki adhikari pyramid ke adhuraa hone kii vajah se mantralay kaa udghaatan nahin hone kii baat se inkaar kar rahe hai
 NRDA chairman N
 baijendra kumaar kehete hai, ''nirmaan kaary puraa nahin ho paaya he isliye nae mantralay main kaam kuch din baad hi shuru ho paaegaa
 "but the entire government staff has justified and praised the construction of the pyramid
" lok nirmaan mantri brajmohan agarwal pyramid nirmaan ko vaidic parampara kaa hissaa bataate hue kehete hai, ''prakruti main kai ghatnaon ko vaastu shaastra niyantrit karata he
 The construction of the pyramid is not surprising
 ''pyramid visheshgy or chhattisgarh pyramid spiritual socity ke adhyaksh shailendra jain kii maane to 37 meter ooncha yah pyramid raman sarkaar ke liye vaaki main sarthak sabit hoga
 Ravindra Prasad, the project manager of IVRCL Infrastructure Ltd, the company that built the pyramid, claims that it will be one of the larger concrete pyramids built around the world
 haalanki is khaas pyramid kaa laabh aam janata nahin uthaa sakegi
 Only special people will be able to enter the ministry through this
 mantralay ke mukhya abhiyantaa salil shrivastav bataate hai ki pyramid ke bheetar se mukhyamantri, mantri or adhikari hi pravesh karenge
 While there are three different routes for the general public to enter
 nae mantralay bhawan main vaastu ke or bhi upaay kiye gaye hai
 For example, only the Chief Minister will sit on the fifth floor of the Ministry, like any king-maharaja
 mantrimandal ke sadasyon or adhikariyon ke chembar baaki kii chaar manjilon par hai
 All the chambers have marble, granite and Italian flooring
 mukhyamantri ke chembar main woodan floring he
 Special materials sourced from China have been installed in its falls ceiling
 vaastu shastriyon ke mutabik, yah bhi nakaaratmak shaktiyon ko dur rakhane kaa upaay he
 Some such arrangements have been made in the interior of the cm's Chamber so that the sunlight will fall directly on the place where the Chief Minister will sit and take important decisions

 a number of architectural measures have also been taken to protect the officers from mischief
 unke cabin main belgian glass or germany ke glass block lagaae gaye hai
 The reasoning is that it keeps the mind-brain calm
 jabaki vipaksh ke netaa rabindra choube daawa karte hai, ''sarkaar chaahe kitni kavayad kar le lekin aagaamee chunaav uskaa puraa shaastra bigaad degaa
 "no one knows how auspicious this pyramid proves for the Raman government, but it is so clear that India will take time to overcome superstition

 co / vraceqij50 bijepi ke matrusanghathan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ne ab ek nai theory di he
 The RSS has said that due to the arrival of the Mughals in India during the medieval period, Dalits, tribals and other marginalized sections were born in the country
 bijepi pravaktaa vijay sonkar shastri kii likhi teen kitabon main varisht aresas netaaon ne yah daawa kiya gaya he
 These books are, 'hindu tanners caste, Hindu Khatik caste and Hindu Valmiki caste
 ' haal hi main in kitabon ko aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne relies kiya tha
 'the invaders forced to act disgusting' These books have been written by senior RSS leaders Suresh Soni, Krishna Gopal and Suresh 'bhaiyaji' Joshi
 bhaiyaji joshi likhte hai, 'hindu granthon ke mutabik shudra kabhi achhut nahin the
 Untouchables, Dalits and Indian Muslims became class only after Islamic atrocities in the medieval period
 'vah likhte hai, 'chandravanshi kshatriyon ke hindu swabhimaan ko thes pahunchane ke liye videshi aakrantaon ne unhen (hinduon ko) ghinaune kaam karne ke liye majaboor kiya
 They started committing cow slaughter
 ve gaay kii chamadi nikaalkar uske shav ko viraan jagahon par phenk dete the
 In this way, foreign invaders gave this work to Hindus as punishment and gave birth to a caste-working caste
 ''RSS kaa daawa, mughalkaal kii he daliton kii utpatti'ek anya varisht aresas netaa suresh soni likhte hai, 'daliton kii utpatti turk or mughalkaal kii he
 The Valmiki, Sudarshan, Mazhabi Sikhs and their 624 subcastes today are born out of the atrocities committed on the Brahmins and Kshatriyas
 'tisare RSS netaa krishna gopal likhte hai, 'vaidic kaal main khatic jati ko brahmanon main gina jaataa tha
 It is also worth noting that before the arrival of Muslim invaders, there is no reference to pigs being reared in India
 hinduon ne dharmaraksha ke liye majaboor hokar yah vyavsaay apanaaya
 'trying to bring everyone under the umbrella of the Hindu? It is noteworthy that the RSS, a Hinduist organization, has been promoting the rewriting of Indian history and, at the same time, has dismissed the written history of professionals as anti-hindu
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad aresas ne puraanon par aadhaarit bharat kaa itihaas likhane kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 The RSS has also been accused of trying to influence school and university courses with its agenda in bjp-ruled states
 jaankaar maanate hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko dalit or pichhadon kaa vot bhi mila tha
 There is also a theory that the BJP and the RSS want that Dalits and backward should not be allowed to separate from the Hindu vote bank

 He drinks alcohol and tortures him in various ways
 shimla ne bataaya ki use chat se bhi neeche phenkaa gaya
 The husband wanted a dowry but did not have the status of a parent to fulfill his demand
 uske ek betaa or beti thi, pati kii pratadna ke aage vah apane ko haara hua mahasoos karne lagi or aatmahatya jaise kadam uthaane kaa vichaar man main aayaa, magar bacchon kaa cheharaa uske saamne aa jaataa tha
 Shimla recounts that one day late at night she left the house with her son and daughter, and boarded a train and left for Banda
 uske paas ek din kaatane ke liye paisa nahin tha, magar banda pahunchane par use parichiton kaa aisa saath mila ki usamen ladane kaa jajba jaag uthaa
 Today, Shimla's son and her daughter are pursuing graduation, while Simla herself runs a family with embroidery stitching
 ab to ve un garib balikaon ko nishulk silaai-kadhai sikhaa rahi hai, jo swaavlambee banakar kuch kar guzarana chaahati hai
 Both children are continuing their studies by teaching tuition, they also teach free tuition to poor children
 shimla kahati he ki uskaa parivaar aaj thik chal rahaa he
 She is walking with the hope that the lives of children should be preserved
 unhen is baat kaa afsos nahin he ki pati kii ore se tiraskaar va pratadna mili, magar aatmasantosh is baat kaa he ki ve bhi samaaj ke un logon ke kaam aa rahi hai, jinhen rojgaar hasil karne ke liye kisi ke sahyog kii jarurat he
 She gives a message to women struggling with the opposite situation, 'don't give up, but be prepared to face it
 jo log sangharsh karte hai samaaj bhi unka saath detaa he
 He was awarded the Sumitra Jijji Smriti Samman at a function held in the capital Bhopal on Sunday, in appreciation of the struggle of Shimla

 Despite this, the check-up game between Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav continues

 Mulayam Singh Yadav called a meeting of Lohia Trust on Thursday, which did not include SP President Akhilesh Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav, Azam Khan, Dharmendra Yadav and Balram Yadav
 akhilesh gut ne mulaayam kii is baithak kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 It is clear that the spark of rebellion in the Mulayam clan is burning
 lohia trust ke bahaane shivpal apni siyaasi jameen majboot karne main lage hai
 In the political circles, it is believed that Mulayam Singh Yadav can take some political steps on the pretext of this meeting
 yahi vajah he ki is baithak par sabhi kii nigahen lagi hue hai
 Before the assembly elections, Akhilesh along with uncle Ram Gopal Yadav planted Shivpal's whereabouts

 The party is now completely Akhileshmay
 shivpal lagaataar mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko target par lete rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 Ever since the defeat in the assembly elections, Shivpal has been publicly saying that the party should be given the command of Mulayam Singh Yadav, but Akhilesh has clearly said that he is the president of the party and will remain
 party kii kaman kisi ko nahin denge
 To pressurize Akhilesh, he also chanted the formation of a separate party
 par akhilesh ke iraade main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 After this came the news that Shivpal can go to BJP
 is par bhi akhilesh khamoshi akhriyaar kiye rahe
 Shivpal is constantly laying his political board with the help of Mulayam
 shivpal ko ummid he ki mulaayam ke sahare wo apni raajnneetik naiya paar laga lenge
 That is why time and time again they say that they will unite the socialists and form a secular front, which will be headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 shivpal gut kaa kambaikaspa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne pichley dinon lohia trust karyaalay main hui baithak main bada faisla lete hue akhilesh ke kareebi chaar sadasyon ko trust se bedakhal kar diya tha

 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav did not attend the Lohia Trust meeting
 baithak ke baad shivpal yadav ne kaha ki philhal trust main vahi rahegaa jo lohia hit main kaam karegaa
 When Akhilesh and Ram Gopal were not involved in the meeting, Shivpal said that the information of the meeting was given to everyone, maybe some work has been done
 vahiin akhilesh yadav ko trust kaa mukhiya banane kii chal rahi charchaa ko shivpal yadav ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 Shivpal Yadav said that the chairman of the trust is Netaji and will remain the same

 bijepi ne party saansad varun gandhi ko raajnneetik gatividhiyaan apane nirvachan kshetra sultanpur tak hi simit rakhane kii sakht hidaayat di thi
 Despite this, Varun went on a tour of Allahabad, due to which the BJP is said to be very angry
 baahar jane se pehle ijaajat lene kii hidayataparty ne varun gandhi ko sakhti ke saath kaha he ki wo chunaav kshetra se baahar nikalne se pehle ijaajat len
 The BJP said that on May 1, he was not allowed to visit Allahabad on behalf of top party leaders
 khud ko siem ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne kii koshishane vaale weekend main elahabaad main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak he, jisamen uttar pradesh ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 The party has not yet considered anyone's candidacy for the post of Chief Minister, but due to Varun Gandhi's move to Allahabad last month, many leaders have feared that he would cast himself as CM candidate trying
 bijepi main poster war par sangrampichley dinon party ke kuch netaaon ne ek poster jari kiya tha, jisamen smriti irani ko biimaar jabaki varun gandhi ko zyada lokapriy ho rahe netaa ke taur par pesh kiya gaya tha
 Since then, there has been an uproar in the party
 varun ke saath laga gandhi ban rahaa adchanvarun gandhi soshal media par kaaphi active hai or party ke sabase lokapriy netaaon main se ek gine jate hai
 However, his relationship with the top leadership of the BJP and the union strategists over his blood relations with Gandhi associated with his name and with the Congress high command is not considered good
 pradesh bijepi ke ek netaa ke mutabik varun gandhi ko vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ke sanket ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 He said, 'he represents the Gandhi family in BJP
 ye sangh kii vichaardhaara ke vipareet he
 'the report submitted to the High Command, led by PM Narendra Mordi and party's national president Amit Shah, BJP has decided to stop the politics of dynasty in the organization
 pradesh bijepi ke adhyaksh keshav prasad maurya ne varun gandhi ke elahabaad daure kii report nai dilli main party ke sheersh netritv ko bhej thi
 The equation of the changed relationship told that when the party sought an answer from Varun Gandhi about this, he said that he would continue to meet the farmers
 iske baad bijepi netritv ne unhen sultanpur se baahar raajnneetik gatividhiyaan karne se pehle party se ijaajat lene kaa aadesh suna diya
 When Rajnath Singh was BJP President, Varun had a good relationship with him
 laal krishna adwani ke saath bhi unki kareebi thi lekin narendra modi ke piem or amit shah ke bijepi adhyaksh banane ke baad rishton ke sameekaran bhi badal gaye

 - input language gujarat main johariyon kii hadtaal ab 30 din puraani ho gai he
 Never before have shops of jewelers remained closed for so long
 johari dukaane chhodkar roj sadakon par kabhi maun raily to kabhi bike raily samet alag-alag kaarykram kar rahe hai
 There is a protest against the one percent excise duty on gold and silver jewelery
 sarkaar se baatcheet hui he, lekin nateeja nahin nikal rahaa
 The government is ready to improve on some provisions, but is not ready to withdraw the excise duty
 ek hypavar cameti banaai gai he joki 60 dinon main report degi, lekin johari isse santusht nahin hai
 Hence, their strike continues
 mahatvapurn he ki is hadtaal se rozaana hajaaron karod rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 According to an estimate, the daily gold trade in the country is between five and 6,000 crore rupees
 ab tak deshbhar main vyapaar ke nuksaan kaa aankada ek lakh karod ko paar kar gaya he, lekin samaadhaan kaa rasta najar nahin aa rahaa he
 The government feels that black money in this area can be reduced by increasing duty in gold
 sarkari anumaan yah he ki zyaadaatar log apane kaale dhan se sona-chaandi kharidte hai
 Where excise duty can be calculated at every level of money and the government will also get income
 tippaniyan While jewelers feel that corruption will only increase
 unka kahana he ki pehle bhi jab sone main sarkari vibhaagon kaa dakhal zyada tha tab bhrashtachar apane charam par tha
 The government is doing huge damage to their business because of their recognition
 is excise duty se logon ke liye sona or mahangaa ho jayega, unke vyapaar par nuksaan hoga auki sarkari vibhaag ko bhrashtachar ke liye paise dene padenge wo alag, kyonki ek gahanaa banane main sone kii safai, shuddhta, quality se lekar karigar auki bikri tak kai str se kaam hota he
 It is not possible to document excise at all levels, so government officials will have to feed money to escape
 donon hi paksh apni baat manwaane par ade hue hai
 But in this strike, the artisans who made the jewelery are crushing, because their wages are being killed
 philhal to johariyon ne unhen tankhwaah dena tay kiya he, lekin kaam ke abhaav main unhen kaaphi dikkatein aa rahi hai

 It is important that thousands of crores of rupees are being lost daily by this strike
 ek anumaan ke anusaar, desh main rojaanaa paanch se 6,000 karod rupee kaa sone kaa kaarobaar hota he
 So far, the loss of trade across the country has crossed one lakh crore, but there is no way to find a solution
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki sone main duty badhaakar is kshetra main kaale dhan ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Government estimates are that most people buy gold and silver from their black money
 excise duty se jahaan harek str par paison kaa hisaab lagaaya ja sakegaa or sarkaar ko aay bhi hogi
 The comments jabaki johariyon ko lagata he isse bhrashtachar badhegaa hi
 He says that even before the intervention of government departments was more in gold, corruption was at its peak
 sarkaar apni manyata kii vajah se unke vyapaar ko baari nuksaan kar rahi he
 This excise duty will make gold more expensive for people, their business will suffer and the government department will have to pay money for corruption, because gold becomes a jewel, from cleanliness, purity, quality to artisans and sales
 Work is done from the level
 itane sabhi staron par excise ke kaagazat karnaa sambhav nahin, lihaaza bachane ke liye sarkari adhikariyon ko paise khilaane padenge
 Both sides are adamant on getting their point
 lekin is hadtaal main gahanon ko banane vaale karigar pis rahe hai, kyonki unki mazdooree maari ja rahi he
 At present, the jewelers have decided to pay them, but they are facing lot of problems due to lack of work

 ol india agricultural students association (AIASA) ne agriculture ke field main padhai kar rahe students ko behatar rojgaar na milane ke kaaran sitambar or oktober ke maheene main vyapak andolan karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The association submitted a memorandum related to it to the Prime Minister on 20 August
 association ke president sudhir kumaar ne kaha he ki agar unki maang par koi dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he to agriculture ke field main padhai karne vaale students ke saath wo desh bhar main vyapak pradarshan karenge
 Sudhir says that in a country like India where more than 60 per cent of the population's employment is dependent on agriculture, the absence of the Indian Agriculture Service is unbearable for the candidates studying in this field
 vahiin, inhone kaha ki jahaan science or arts ke branches main padhai kar rahe students ko acchhee fellowship di jaati he, vahiin science ke antargat hi aanevaali is field ke students ke saath bhedbhaav kiya jaataa he
 Even the amount received in the fellowship is less than other fields
 sudhir ne aage kaha ki koi bhi raajnneetik party unke mudde par thik se dhyaan nahin de rahi he
 He said that in order to make 'kisan Channel' good and popular, field students of agriculture were needed, but here too students were recruited on a very negligible scale
 21 april ko is saal students ne 'blike de' ghoshit kiya tha
 Not only this, AIASA says that they will further gather old and new agricultural students from all over the country and put their demands widely before the government

 Vinay Katiyar has said that if the claim on the mosque remains intact, then we will claim six and a half thousand other disputed mosques
 saath hi unhone kaha ki babari masjid naam kii koi cheez bachi hi nahin thi
 He asked Owaisi the question that he should tell where to build the mosque, Ramlala is seated in Ayodhya and there is Ram's temple, now it will give only grandeur and divinity
 jald hi vahaan bhavy or divya ram mandir banegaa
 Katiyar said that when Babar's tomb is not built in Afghanistan, what will be built in India
 daawey ke mutabikbabari masjidakaagaj main he hi nahin, kahin babar ke naam kaa kuch nahin he
 There is nothing left in the name of leaving, now it is just that Lord Ram is in the temple of Tat and now he has to build a grand temple
 agar vah ayodhya se hat jate to phir ham baaki mandiron ke bare main sochenge ki baaki ham chhod den
 We have always said that we need three places Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura
 kaashi or mathura main hamaare mandir pehle se hai lekin ayodhya main aisa koi dhaancha nahin tha
 First leave the claim on Ayodhya temple, then we will think what to do of kashi-mathura
 bataa den ki ovaisi ne kaha tha ki supreme court aasthaa nahin sabooton ke aadhaar par apana faisla sunayegi or ayodhya main babari masjid banegi
 He said that the Babri Masjid was ours and will remain, after the Supreme Court's decision comes in our favor, we will build a mosque there

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav nattejey ghoshit hone ke baad bhi yah tay nahin ho paa rahaa he ki rajya main agali sarkaar kis party kii hogi
 The public has not given an absolute majority to any party, after which the matter is completely stuck
 ek taraf satta ganvaa chuki congress ne kshetreey dal jedies ko madad dekar sarkaar banane kaa daawa kiya he
 So at the same time, the BJP, which won the most seats, has submitted a claim to the Governor to form the government
 aise main ab gend rajyapal ke paale main he or yah faisla unhen hi lenaa he ki kis party ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaayaa jaae
 In the event of this association, the Governor is being discussed as having five options, on the basis of which he can take a decision
 ye hai wo paanch vikalp-pehla vikalp:rajyapal ke paas is baat par vichaar karne kaa mauka hota he ki chunaav se pehle gathit gathbandhan dalon ko sarkaar ke liye bulaayaa jaae
 But this is not the case in Karnataka and the Congress and JDS have decided to form a coalition government after the results
 isliye rajyapal is aadhaar par donon dalon ko bulaane kii sthiti main najar nahin aate hai
 Second option: the party that gets the highest number of seats after the results, claims the governor to form the government, after which the governor considers that and in the event of having sufficient numbers, invites the larger party to form the government
 
 teesraa vikalp:chunaav pashchaat bane gathbandhan ko bhi rajyapal sarkaar banane ke liye bula sakate hai
 After the results, if some parties get aligned and they claim to form the government, the governor can invite them to form the government too
 karnataka main philhal yahi sameekaran hai
 Fourth option: If the coalition parties after the election also claim to form the government with the external support of any other party or independent legislators, the governor can also ask them to form the government
 paanchvaan vikalp:agar kisi bhi dal ke paas sarkaar banane ke liye aavashyak vidhayak sankhya na ho to is paristhiti main rajyapal raashtrapati shashan ke liye kadam uthaa sakate hai

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) IPL 2019 has started
 ab tak hue maichon main cricket phens ko ummid ke mutabik kai romaanchak match dekhne ko mili
 This journey, which lasts about two months, is still in its initial stage
 is baar ipel kii jaisi shuruyaat hui he usase tay he ki is baar bhi ye toornamet romaanchak rahane vaala he
 Fans will also have to wait until the finals for the 12th season champion of the world's largest cricket league
 lekin final se pehle toornament main ab tak jo match hue hai usase jo sanyog bane hai uske mutabik is baar kii champion sirf or sirf ek hi team lag rahi he, jo pehle bhi 3 baar khitaab par kabja jamaa chuki he
 Yes, we are talking about Mumbai Indians (MI)
 aamtaur par har ipel main dhili shuruyaat karne vaali mumbai indiens ke liye is baar champion banane ke sanyog baith rahe hai
 We are saying this because the Mumbai Indians, who have been the three-time champions so far, have lost in the first match of that tournament
 or is baar ke bhi pehle match main use dilli capitals ke khilaaf haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Let us know that Mumbai Indians became the IPL champions for the first time in 2013
 iske baad 2015, 2017 main bhi vah khitaab par kabja kii
 It is also worth noting that after one year or season, she became the champion
 agar 2013 main vah champion bani to 2014 ke baad vaale sijan yani 2015 main vah champion bani
 She also became the champion in the post-2016 2017 season
 or ab 2018 ke baad ek or sijan uske saamne he
 She was the champion in 2017 and lost the first match of 2019
 matlab saaf he ki is baar jo sanyog baith rahaa he ki wo mumbai indiens ke paksh main baith rahaa he
 However it is too early to say who will be the winner of the tournament
 iskaa faisla to jab final match main aakhri gend phenki jaaegi tab hi maaloom padegaa
 Such was mi's journey in 2013, 2015 and 2017, when in 2013 when Mumbai Indians became champions for the first time, they played the first match of the tournament against RCB
 use apane pehle hi match main 2 ran se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 After this, in the final match, Mumbai Indians had defeated Chennai Super Kings by 23 runs to register a spectacular victory
 2015 main mumbai indiens jab champion bani thi to toornament ke pehle match main uskaa saamana tha KKR se
 Here too, he suffered a 7-wicket defeat in the first match
 lekin iske baad final match main mumbai indiens ne chennai superkings ko 41 ranon se parajeet kar diya tha
 At the same time, in 2017, he had to face defeat in the first match of the tournament
 6 april 2017 ko rising pune superjoint ke khilaaf khele gaye is match main use 7 wicket se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 However, this defeat was changed by Mumbai Indians in the final
 final mukaable main usne pune ko 1 ran se maat de thi
 Talking about 2019, this time also he had to face defeat against Delhi Capitals in the first match
 24 march ko khele gaye is mukaable main dilli capitals ne mumbai indiens ko 37 ranon se maat de thi
 Now looking at all these results, the coincidences that are happening are definitely going in favor of Mumbai Indians, but the team is made by playing on the field
 is sanyog se mumbai indiens jaisi team ko jarur is baar ke toornament main acha karne kii prerana mil sakati he
 Chief selector MSK Prasad on Tuesday clarified that his committee selected Ravindra Jadeja for the Test series based on his fitness report, in which he was declared fully fit
 jadeja ke kandhe main jakadan thi, jisase vah perth main duusare test main nahin khel sake the or coach ravi shastri ne patrakaron se kaha ki yah khilaadi bharat se hi is chot ke saath aayaa tha
 This Saurashtra all-rounder has been included in the Boxing Day Test
 prasad ne kaha, ‘kisi bhi chayan baithak kii purv sandhya par chayan samiti ko sabhi khilaadiyon kii fitness report di jaati he
 Jadeja was perfectly fit in that report
 jab hamane unhen chunaa tha, to uske baad vah ranjai trophy main bhi khele, jisamen unhone 60 over gendbaaji kii thi
 So there is no question of his unfit at the time of selection for Australia
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab bhi koi swasthya sambandhit mudda uthta he, to hamaara ek samooh he jo in sab chizon ko dekhtaa he
 Everything is seen by the physio and it is also clearly given in the statement
 ’ prasad ne yah bhi kaha ki mahendra singh dhoni kaa newjiland daure ke liye tii-20 team main vaapasi karnaa tay hi tha, kyonki unhen sirf westeindies or australia ke khilaaf chah tii-20 antarrashtriya maichon ke liye aaraam diya gaya he
 Prasad said, 'with regard to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, when he was given rest, we said that he will be rested for these six matches, so that we can give more chances to Dinesh Karthik and Rishabh Pant
 yahi ahm kaaran tha
 Now they have played some matches, so we thought that we should bring Mahendra Singh Dhoni back in the team again
 ’unhone rishabh pant ko australia or newjiland ke khilaaf vanade team se baahar rakhane ke faisle ke bare main kaha ki aisa unhen aage kii badi chunautiyon ke liye tarotaaja rakhane ke liye kiya gaya he
 He assured that this young wicket-keeper is still involved in the 2019 World Cup race
 mukhya chayankarta ne suchit kiya ki ab se sirf 20 khilaadi hi vishwa cap tak kor team ke rup main khelenge
 He said, 'as promised, we said that we are moving closer to the World Cup and we have only 13 odis left
 yah ab kor team kii tarah hi he
 We have selected 20 players and only these 20 members will play from now on

 chidambaram ne kaha he ki vahaan ke nagarikon ko bina manjuuri ke hamaare desh main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Along with this, he also questioned the justification for issuing a large number of visas to Bangladeshis
 mumbai hamalon ke baad suraksha sthiti par kadi najar rakh rahe chidambaram ne bangladeshiyon ke bharat aane or visa kii samaysima samaapt hone ke baad unke waapas nahin lautne par nazar rakhane ke liye aprabhavi nigaraanee pranali par chintaa jataai
 Referring to the massive population pattern change due to illegal Bangladeshis in Assam and West Bengal, he said, 'I do not see Bangladeshis as Muslim or non-muslim
 vah bangladeshi hai or unka bagaiyr visa ke bharat aane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 The Home Minister told a channel, "they don't have work permits, they don't have any means to work here
" ' avaidh pravaas rokane ke liye uthaae jane vaale kadamon ke bare main puche jane par chidambaram ne kaha, 'ab in chizon par gaur kar rahaa hum ki hamaari simaaon, passport niyantran binduon par kya ho rahaa he
 i think a large-scale visa is being issued to Bangladeshis every month
 ' unhone kaha, ' itani sankhya main visa jari karne kaa koi kaaran nahin he

 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said on Friday that the Kejriwal government does not work on the rights it has

 Delhi government-run power distribution companies are charging permanent charges from consumers on a 23,000 MW load basis
 jabaki khud dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli main bijli kii maang kareeb 7000 megawatt he tobijli companiyankis aadhaar par dilli waalon se kareeb 23000 megawatt lod ke mutabik paisa vasuul rahe hai
 In this way, the Delhi government is getting about Rs 287 crore from discoms every month
 iske saath hi vah discom ko 200 karod pratimah sabsidi bhi de rahi he
 That is, the electricity companies have so far recovered Rs 800 crore more from the consumers, so there is 2400 crore annually
 bijepi ne nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar jaanati he ki ab 2019 chunaav ke kuch hi din bache hai, isliepurn rajya kaa muddautha rahi he jabaki pani or bijli puri tarah kejariwal sarkaar ke adheen hai
 Therefore, water is not available and electricity companies are benefiting

 aise makaanon ke nivaasiyon ko vaikalpik sthanon par shift karke, makaanon ko todaa janaa chahie, taaki koi haadasa na ho or log surakshit rah saken
 Not all basic facilities in a single colony The Leader of Opposition alleged that the government had promised that all those facilities would be provided to 200 unauthorized colonies within a year

 samaaj ke roodhiwaadee rivaajon ke khilaaf awaz uthaanaa aasaan nahin hota, lekin jodhpur main ek 19 saal kii ladki ne kuch aisa hi kiya
 Shanta Devi Meghwal turned down her child marriage in 11 months
 shanta devi kaa parivaar garib he, pita makaan banane main karigar kaa kaam karte hai or jab shanta 11 maheene kii bacchee thi to uski shaadi kar badi bahan ke saath kar di gai thi, lekin shanta ko iskaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 After this, the family moved to Jodhpur, Shanta is now a BA second year student
 teen saal pehle usko shaadi ke baar main pataa chalaa
 The boy is 9 years older than him and less educated
 phir shanta ne maa-baap ko samajhaayaa ki vah shaadi thukraana chaahati he, maa baap ne uski baat maan lee, lekin ab jati panchayat aade aa rahi he
 Saying, deposit 16 lakh rupees, then the marriage will be broken
 panchayat ne bal-vivaah maanane se inkaar kar dene par birdari se baahar karne va hukka-pani band karne kaa talibani farmaan suna diya he, lekin shanta is bal-vivaah kii bediyon se aaazaad hokar apni marji se apana jeevanasathi chunakar shikshak bananaa chaahati he, jisase vah samaaj ko nai disha pradaan kar sake
 Shanta Devi's family is supporting her in this fight, for which the Panchs of the society have issued a decree to impose a fine of Rs
16 lakhs while socially boycotting the whole family, otherwise Shanta Devi is being forcibly threatened for sending her in-laws
 is

 bal-vivaah nirast karaane ke liye peedita va uske parijanon ne sarathi trust kii managing trustee kriti bharti se sampark kar apni vyathaa sunai
 The victim's father Padmaram Meghwal dared to get the marriage annulled for the happiness of his daughter Shantadevi, on which the entire society rallied against him
 trust kaa kahana he ki pehle ve sasuraal waalon se baat karke vivaah todane kii raay denge or agar nahin maanate he to kaanoon kaa rasta apanaayenge
 Shanta Devi's family is poor, the father works as an artisan in building houses, and when Shanta was an 11-month-old girl, she was married to her elder sister, but Shanta did not know anything about it
 iske baad parivaar jodhpur aa gaya, shanta ab bie second year kii student he
 Three years ago he came to know about the wedding

 The first 1,500-page chargesheet filed by the CBI on July 3 in the Ishrat Jahan case has raised more questions than answers
 isamen 15 june, 2004 ko mumbai kii 19 varshiya chaatra ishrat samet chaar logon ke saath hui gujarat police kii muthbhed ko farji yani sidhe-sidhe hatya bataaya gaya he
 In this, seven officers of Gujarat Police have been accused but it is not disclosed whether Ishrat was a terrorist or not
 sabase dilachasp baat yah ki isamen kisi bhi netaa kaa naam lene se bachaa gaya he
 But this charge sheet presents a terrible picture of Surhana and intelligence agencies joining hands to help political masters
 abhi tak gopneeyata ke aavaran main kaam karte aa rahe khufia beuro (ibi) kii kaaryastylee par pehali baar saarvajanik rup se sawalia nishaan uthe hai
 In this way, a cheap kind of fight has started between IB and CBI
 sibiai ke mutabik, muthbhed kii yojana gujarat kii sabsidiari ibi (esaibi) ne banaai, jo centre main ibi or rajya main police ke tahat kaam karti he
 According to the chargesheet, Special Director of IB, Rajendra Kumar, who headed the SIB of Gujarat from 2001 to 2005, was posted as additional DGP of the state
 pi
 Pandey and DIG d
 ji
 Together with Vanzara, they carried out the murder in a planned manner
 kumaar ne hi yah jaankaree di thi ki ishrat or teen anya—pranesh pillai urf javed shaikh, amjad ali rana or jishaan johar—lashkare taiyaba ke aatankwaadi hai or narendra modi ko maarane nikle hai
 The police team kidnapped him and kept him illegally hidden and given him drugs before he was "murdered"
 drug die jane kii baat aaropapatr main to nahin thi lekin ek anaupchaarik press conference main sibiai afasaron ne isaki pushti kii
 To justify the encounter, weapons were placed in Sheikh's car and handed over to "militants" by SIB
 darasal, muthbhed kii praathmiki iske hone se pehle hi likh lee gai thi
 This was stated in the charge sheet, quoting the CBI investigation
 isamen kumaar kaa naam he lekin unka or ibi ke teen duusare afasaron ke naam aropiyon kii suchi main nahin hai
 a CBI officer says Kumar, p
 mittal, em
 K
 sinha or rajeev vankhede ko duusare aaropapatr main aropit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reason: Some aspects are yet to be proved in the investigation
 kumaar 31 july ko ritair hone vaale hai
 Pandey is absconding and suspended Vanzara is in jail
 aaropapatr is par bhi maun he ki maare gaye chaaron lashkar ke gurgey the yaa nahin
 The taped conversation between Mujammil, a key let operative, and Javed Sheikh, a partner of Ishrat, about the terrorist attack on India is not explained in it
 khud ibi pramukh asif ibrahim ne pradhanmantri or kendriya grih mantri ke daftar ko bataaya tha ki ishrat or shaikh ke alaava unka saath de rahe do pakistani bhi lashkar ke gurgey the, jo kuch netaaon ko maarane ke mishan par nikle the
 Senior Advocate K
 tii
 s
 tulsi kehete hai ki is baat kaa koi arth nahin ki ishrat yaa duusare aatankwaadi the yaa unke aatankwaadiyon se rishte the
 In his words, "the police executioner is few
" unako shubahaa hi tha to un par mukadmaa chalaate, maar nahin daalana chahie tha
 This is clearly murder
 ” unka maananaa he ki sibiai ko siyaasi aakaaon ko bhi ghere main laana chahie tha, ''vah kanoon se upar nahin he”
 Another legalist, on the condition of anonymity, says that the police and IB officers will also have the political impact of taking the CBI encounter as a fake
 unke mutabik, ''sibiai ne siyaasi aakaaon se kisi kaa naam to nahin liya he lekin uski maar kaaphi dur tak pahunch chuki he
 "this will give enough spice to the Congress to target Modi
 gujarat ke ek varisht vakil aaropapatr par sawaal khadaa karte hai, ''ghatana ke nau saal baad aaropapatr daayar kiye jane ke baavjood yah na to sajeesh kaa khulaasa karata he or na hi chaaron kii hatya ke peeche kii manshaa kaa
 "A CBI officer has an answer
" uske shabdon main, ''yah sabake liye jeet jaisaa he
 The IB was credited with accurate input, so did the police investigation and the elimination of terrorists
 modi ke liye yah khud ko ek aise netaa ke rup main pesh karne kaa mauka tha, jise aatankwaadiyon se khatra tha
 It is fun to see how the UPA government got caught in its mess
 sibiai kaa aaropapatr 6 agast, 2009 ko kendriya grih mantralay kii ore se pesh 14 panne ke halafname se itar baaten kahata he
 The government submitted an affidavit in the Gujarat High Court challenging Ishrat and Sheikh's families as innocent, challenging their encounter
 isamen usne kaha tha ki ishrat or shaikh donon lashkar ke gurgey the
 Sheikh was in constant touch with the Muzammil of Lashkar responsible for plotting to target VVIP persons and Mujammil had joined Ishrat in the network so that they would be responsible for their activities while pretending to be husband and wife
 To roam halafname main kaha gaya tha ki mujammil se shaikh kii mulaakaat march-april 2004 main oman main uske pravaas ke dauraan hui thi
 It was three months before the encounter
 yah bhi ki centre sarkaar ko pataa tha ki lashkar chotii ke rashtriya or pradeshik netaaon kii hatya kaa mansuba bana rahaa he
 However, when the Modi government referred this affidavit to the court, the central government filed a second affidavit on September 29, 2009, in which it did not deny its earlier claims related to Ishrat and Sheikh, but gave conclusive evidence
 Rather, he lightened it by stating general input
 usamen kaha gaya ki sabooton kii ''jaanch or un par karrwai karnaa rajya sarkaar kaa kaam tha
 "now the central government is supporting the demand for a CBI inquiry, saying that it was not averse to the CBI investigation
 bijepi pravaktaa nirmala seetaraman kahati hai, ''is maamle main centre sarkaar ke daakhil kiye gaye pehle halafname kaa ab sibiai ke daayar aaropapatr se milan karen to iske peeche kii siyaasi manshaa saaf taur par saamne aa jaati he
 "modi's strategy will now be that the police officers accused in this case do not testify against him
" gujarat police ke ek bhi aaropee varisht afasar ne agar unka naam le liya to sibiai bade aaraam se modi ke chunavi rath ko tham sakati he
 At the same time, Modi would also like to make maximum profit by presenting himself as a persecuted soul
 khel to abhi shuru hua he

 This notice has been given by the Supreme Court on the petition of MP Singh, a senior citizen living in Mainpuri, UP
 empi singh ne shikaayat kii thi ki cenier citigen ko mili is acchhee suvidha kaabannupaalan nahin kar rahe or bujurgon ko kai baar iske liye ghoose deni padati he
 MP Singh complained about this to the Reserve Bank and the government several times, but no action was taken
 kya hota he reverse mortgejariverse mortges ke tahat senior citigen apni sampati kisi bank ke paas girvee rakh kar apana jivan yaapan kar sakate hai, or ye sampati paisa lautaane ke baad waapas ho jaati he
 This can be considered as a kind of retirement scheme, under which senior citizens can take loan from the bank to earn their livelihood by keeping their property
 asal main yah home lone kaa ulataa jaisaa hota he, isliye ise reverse mortges kehete he
 The person taking the home loan pays the loan every month through EMI, while in reverse mortgage, the senior citizen gets a fixed amount every month to cover their expenses
 is lone par byaaj vagairah jodakar senior citigen kaa jo bakaayaa banataa he, vah kabhi bhi ise chukaakar property waapas le saktaa he
 If the senior citizen dies without paying this money, then his child cannot take the property without paying the outstanding loan amount

 Amnesia is not new
 aksar log bahut sari chijen bhul jate hai
 But what will you say about such a murderer who says that he remembers counting up to ten murders and then does not remember the count
 or ye das kii ginati bhi use tab yaad ai jab police ne use bas ek katl ke iljaam main pakadaa
 These murderers are actually robbers first
 magar aadat ye he ki lut ke baad ye apane shikaar ko jinda nahin chhodte
 Some time ago an NIA police officer was killed
 ye katl bhi is kaatil ne hi kiya tha
 Serial killers in this world have been many and have become part of many live stories
 lekin police kii giraft main aae munir or ashutosh mishra ye serial kilors kii wo nai jodi he, jinke aas-paas is daur kaa koi doosraa serial killer tikta bhi nahin
 He did not remember how many slaughtered
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki katl or lutpaat ke maamalon main ye psyco serial kilors kuch itane aage nikal chuke hai ki ab inhen khud bhi thik se ye yaad nahin ki inhone ab tak kitnon kii jaan lee he or kitne karod rupye luute hai
 And no one else but the police who arrested these gangsters named Munir and Ashutosh, are telling themselves with their tongues
 kai maamle darjakarib do saalon se police ke chhalaava bane munir or uske saathi ashutosh ko das katl kii ginati to yaad he
 But no further
 munir ko pichley 28 june ko upi ke greater noida se giraftaar kiya gaya
 But since there were many cases against him in Delhi too, Delhi Police brought him on transit remand, but when the questioning started, he confessed to such incidents that it was difficult for the policemen to calculate the accounts themselves
 lekin ye jurm ke liye uske junun kaa to sirf ek pahalu bhar tha
 How merciless Munir is can be gauged by the fact that he commits robbery and robbery, but in this task, if anyone comes in the way for a moment, then he is not too late to shoot him
 Would do pulisavaalon ko bhi nahin chodtamunir beraham to he, wo pulisavaalon se bhi khaas nafrat karata he
 So much so that whenever he sees a policeman alone, he shoots him straight away and immediately snatches away his weapon and runs away
 phir inhen hathiyaaron se wo lutpaat kii agali vaardaat ko bhi anjaam detaa he
 According to the police, so far more than four policemen have been murdered and many cases have been forgotten
 lekin ye to uske siraphire mizaaj ke ajeeb or chaunkaanewaale kisse abhi or bhi hai
 Many agencies may not have been caught behind, and it would not have been common to have a serial killer
 agar usne enie ke dspi tanzeel ahamed kii jaan naa lee hoti
 But due to suspicion, he not only murdered Tanjeel Ahmed and his wife, but also shot 24 bullets to Tanjeel in hate
 or bas isi ke baad enie or upi estf samet kai alag-alag agenciyaan uske peeche pad gayi
 Munir had already established his roots in the world of marajur with suspicion
 lekin tanzeel ahamed kii jaan lene ke baad pehali baar uskaa naam surkhiyon main aayaa or sirf upi police hi nahin, balki enie or upi estf samet kai agenciyaan uske peeche pad gayi
 Actually, Munir along with some of his friends committed a bank robbery in Dhampur, Bijnor in December 2015
 is dakaiti main 91 lakh rupye luute the
 From then on, the Bijnor police were lying behind Munir and Munir felt that Tanjil was telling the police his news, and just in this doubt, he took the life of Tanjil
 property ke silsile main tanzeel se hui baatcheetamunir ke sir par lut ke rupayon se amir banane kaa kaisaa bhoot savaar tha, iskaa andaja sirf isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki wo alag-alag bank, atm centre or kaarobaariyon se luute gaye karodon rupye se upi main tabadatod property kharid rahaa tha
 Moreover, in connection with the purchase and purchase of property, he also had several conversations with DSP Tanjil Ahmed
 lekin baad main wo khud hi tanzeel par shaq karne laga tha
 Munirpulis did not keep the phone, if Munir is a psycho killer, he is very well aware of the way the police work
 yahi vajah he ki wo servilans se bachane ke liye kabhi mobile phone kaa istemaal tak nahin karata tha
 And for this reason, he kept laying corpses one after the other, robbing the bank, but for years the police kept cheating
 dilli ke kamala market ke atm main hui lut ke baad bhi police tab dhokhaa kha gai, jab vaardaat ke dauraan us ilaake main active tamaam mobile number khangaalane ke baavjood uske haath khaali rah gaye
 Experts say that Munir's friendship with the police officers was an important reason for this modus operandi
