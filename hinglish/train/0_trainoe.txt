 Excavation may take 30 to 40 days
 " By 5 pm on the first day, only about six inches deep could be excavated in an area of five meters
 shanivaar ko subah das baje se phir se khudaai kaa kaam shuru hoga
 The morning before the excavation, the District Magistrate held a meeting with ASI and GSI officials regarding excavation methods and safety

 In his ashram, one kilometer from Buxar, the government dreamed three months ago that the treasury was buried under the fort of a king who was martyred in a battle with the British in 1857
 shobhan sarkaar ne teen sitambar ko sthaneey prashasan, rajya sarkaar or centre sarkaar ko is bare main avgat karaayaa
 It is being told that Charan Das Mahant, Union Minister of State for Food Processing, visited the fort in the last week of September along with Sant Shobhan Sarkar, who claimed to have suppressed the treasury

 vichaar-vimarsh ke baad eesai adhikariyon ne 18 oktober se khudaai kiye jane kaa nirnay liya
 Historians are claiming that it is difficult to get such a quantity of gold in the fort land, because Raja Rao Rambakhsh Singh was not such a big and magnificent ruler

 On the other hand, gold is yet to come out, but many of its contenders have surfaced

 Sheila Dixit, a veteran Congress leader and three-time Chief Minister of Delhi, died on Saturday at the age of 81
 shila dikshit gandhi parivaar kii kareebi netaa maani jaati thi
 This was the reason that when Sonia Gandhi took charge of the Congress in 1998, she made Sheila Dixit the state president of Delhi
 us vakt congress main kai bade netaa the lekin baavjood iske sonia gandhi kii pehali pasand shila dikshit baniin
 Let us tell you that the Assembly elections in Delhi were held in 1993 and the BJP government was formed
 bijepi ne paanch saal ke kaarykaal main teen mukhyamantri banane pad gaye
 In such a situation, Sonia Gandhi placed a bet on Sheila Dixit before the 1998 assembly elections to help the Punjabi and Brahmin voters of Delhi
 iske peeche vajah ye thi ki shila mulat: punjabi thi or unki shaadi brahman parivaar main hui thi
 Sheila Dixit took charge of the state Congress and activated the organization in Delhi
 shila dikshit ne congress ko bijepi kii dilli sarkaar ke vikalp ke taur par pesh kiya
 He also established himself as an alternative to the then Chief Minister of Delhi Sushma Swaraj
 shila dikshit ne us vakt kii bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf janata ke asantosh ko bhi aawaaj di or is tarah se 1998 main bijepi ko satta se baahar karke congress satta main aa gai
 After this, Sonia Gandhi stamped the name of Sheila Dixit for the Chief Minister of Delhi
 1998 main jab pehali baar shila dikshit mukhyamantri baniin to raajnneetik galiyaaron main mana gaya tha ki kuch din hi wo is pad par rah paaengi or baad main dilli ke hi kisi diggaj netaa ko siem banaaya jayega
 However, a few days later, the rebellion against him also started to rise
 congress ke diggajon main dalit chehre ke taur par choudhary prem singh the to jat netaa sajjan kumaar kii bahari dilli main jabardast pakad thi
 Similarly Jagdish Tytler, Jayaprakash Aggarwal, Subhash Chopra, Rambabu Sharma also had their own political base
 isi ke chalate mana ja rahaa tha ki dilli ke congressi diggaj shila dikshit ke siyaasi kile ko dharashayi kar unki jagah inamen se koi le saktaa he
 Rebels of eviction of Sheila Dixit from power also arose
 kai congressi netaa naaraaz bhi hue, lekin shila dikshit ne apane raajnneetik kaushal or raajnneetik morche se alag team khadi kar apane khilaaf uthne vaale sur ko dabaa diya
 Behind this was the confidence of Congress high command Sonia Gandhi who was with him
 yahi vajah rahi ki shila dikshit ek ke baad lagaataar teen baar dilli kii mukhyamantri baniin or koi unhen maat na de sakaa

 The case of the murder of RSS worker Himmat Patidar in Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, was completely reversed

 The deceased was not the courageous Patidar but Madan Malaviya of his village
 ye vahi shaks tha, jise police himmat kaa kaatil maanakar uski talash kar rahi thi
 The police was suspicious of Madan because he had been missing since the information about the murder of Patidar

 Then the police was brainwashed

 The body was identified after calling the police
 patidaar ke pita lakshminarayan or chachere bhai suresh uski pahchaan kii
 The Hindu organizations started an uproar as soon as the news of the death of Himmat Patidar was killed
 is dauraan maamle kii chaanbin main juty police ko pataa chalaa ki gaanv kaa yuvak madan malviya bhi gaayab he
 After this, the police started looking for Madan as a murderer
 lekin diene test ne is hatyakand kii puri kahani ko hi badal kar rakh diya

 based on the input of in) Congress's steering committee meeting
 unhone kaha ki baithak main to sirf puraane chehre hi dikh rahe hai, iske jawaab main rahul ne kaha ki ham yuvaaon ko bhi saath lekar aaenge or puraane logon ko bhi saath lekar chalenge
 Actually, this meeting was called to decide the dates and place of plenary session
 isliye 16, 17 or 18 march ko dilli main planry seshan kaa elaan kar diya
 Issues of Nirav Modi, farmers, youth, Pakistan and Kashmir also arose in this meeting
 baithak main sabase dilachasp vakya rahaa, jab rahul ne bhavishya kii congress kaa khaakaa khinchaa
 According to sources, Rahul said that we should give special place to the youth, new faces, women and SC-ST at important places in the organization
 is par tapaak se muskuraate hue bagal main baithi sonia gandhi bol padin ki lekin yahaan to saare puraane chehre hi najar aa rahe hai
 Sonia wanted to say that many old leaders lost their hearts, some new faces smiled in their hearts
 puraane netaaon ko ehsaas tha ki congress main badlaav hona hi he or nae chehron ko jagah milanaa bhi tay he
 In this case, not all the elders, but some are sure to be discharged from a large level
 aise main sonia ne khud rahul ko rokkar jo bolaa usne sabhi ko sidhaa sandesh diya ki wo bhi chaahati hai ki nae chehron ko jagah mili
 Also, when Rahul sets up a working committee in the future and many elders are on leave, their displeasure should not be with Rahul
 haalanki, turant maamle ko bhaanpate hue party adhyaksh rahul ne sonia ko jawaab diya ki ham nae chehron ko bhi laaenge or saath hi hamako puraane chehron kii bhi jarurat he
 Overall, Sonia herself shot a political arrow, saying that she would be the old face, which would serve Rahul in the future
 isse pehle bhi sonia khud rahul ko apana bos bataa chuki hai
 You have openly spoken to the Congress leaders that with the loyalty and honesty you have supported me, i hope to do the same with Rahul now
 kul milakar sonia ne kabhi sonia kii rahi congress ko rahul kii congress banane kaa rasta khud hi saafe kar diya
 Apart from this, the biggest emphasis was on the issue of Nirav Modi
 tay hua ki ise sansad se sadak tak uthaae rakhana he
 In Parliament, the party can demand a probe by the JPC (joint Parliamentary Committee) into the matter
 is mudde par desh bhar main sarkaar ko gherte rahane kaa bhi faisla hua
 Not only this, Sonia now takes special care that a direct message should be sent not only among the public, but also among the Congress leaders that now the survey survey of the Congress is Rahul
 aaj bhi sonia stearing cameti kii baithak ke liye pehle hi congress mukhyalay 24 akbar road pahunch gayi
 She moved forward a little, but Rahul did not come
 isliye waapas lautakar get par khadi hokar intjaar karne lageen
 When Rahul came, Sonia accompanied Rahul to the steering committee meeting
 baithak khatm hote hi sonia or rahul purv pradhanmantri doctor manmohan singh ko vidaa karke aage bade
 While Rahul went to talk to the media, Sonia turned to the district
 raste main sonia se poochne par ki aap kuch bolengi to sonia ne kaha ki rahul bolenge
 After that, Sonia stood in the way of 10 Janpath and Rahul continued to talk to the media
 is dauraan sonia ne rahul kaa intjaar kiya
 When Rahul returns, Sonia and Rahul leave the Congress headquarters together and go to 10 Janpath
 iske baad rahul vahaan se apane ghar 12 tughlaq len ke liye nikal gaye
 Significantly, the Congress' biggest decision-making body working committee was dissolved on Friday
 iske baad 34 netaaon kii stearing cameti kaa gathan kar diya gaya, jisamen zyaadaatar kaarysmiti ke hi sadsy the

 On the other hand, the Congress attacked the state government and Shah and said that this has exposed the claim of Bhopal to be 'open defecation free'
 vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh ne kaha ki madhyapradesh ko lekar bhaajapa adhyaksh shah dwaara kiye gaye daavon kii kalai unheen ke saamne khul gai

 5 rajyon main hone vaali chunavi jang se pehle congress kaa modi sarkaar par hamalaa karnaa tej ho gaya he
 On Monday, Congress leader Sachin Pilot held a press conference and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitleeper fiercely
 unhone mehul chokasee, neerav modi,vijay maalyase jude maamalon ko aadhaar banaate hue kaha ki arun jetali ko turant apane pad seistifade dena chahie
 Sachin Pilot said that the Modi government is helping the people who looted the money of the country, the government had information about the scam going on in the Punjab National Bank for the last three and a half years, but did not take any action
 unhone kaha ki vijay maalya, neerav modi, mehul ne ghapala kiya or sarkaar rokane main naakaam rahi
 These people betrayed the country but how did they run away from the country so easily? Sachin Pilot alleged that Sonali Jaitley, daughter of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and her husband were hired by Mehul Chowki's company as retainer for 24 lakhs
 baad main ye 24 lakh waapas lautaa die gaye lekin sawaal he ki satta se jude log hi bhagode logon kii vakaalat karne kyon aage aate hai
 First give money to saffron and then give legal protection

 Sachin Pilot said that if the cbi's own involvement is not clear, then with whose mouth the Government of India and CBI can now investigate corruption cases
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi congress party vitt mantri arun jetali ko inhen muddon par gher chuki he
 The party, under the leadership of Congress President Ahul Gandhi, sought the finance minister's resignation shortly after Vijay Mallya revealed that he had met Arun Jaitley before leaving the country

 dilli ke ek nami skool main nauveen kaksha kii chaatra ke dwaara kii gai aatmahatya ke baad kai tarah ke sawaal uth rahe hai
 The biggest question is how can such incidents be stopped
 abhibhavak or skool prashasan bacchon kii suraksha or unke aatmavishvaas ko badhaane ke liye kya kar sakate hai?mashhoor vakil or bacchon ke liye kaaphi kaam kar chuke ashok agarwal maanate hai ki skulon main bacchon ke kisi bhi tarah ke utpeedan ko rokane ke liye shaikshik or kanoonee donon praavdhaan he
 In addition, under the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), there are strict guidelines for schools that deal with complaints ranging from assaulting a child to criminal incidents and sexual harassment
 bacchon kii counselling karke bhi samasya ko kaaphi had tak kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 But the problem is that school administration and parents often prefer to remain silent on the physical or mental abuse that occurs to children within the big walls of big schools
 ashok agarwalkahate hai ki isaki sabase badi vajah abhibhavakon kaa skool prashasan main dakhal naa ke baraabar hona he
 Such incidents can be reduced drastically if 50 percent of the parents are advised and involved in the management committee of the schools
 abhibhavakon kaa dakhal jarurbhibhavakon kii hissedari kaa sabase bada phayda yah hoga ki naa sirf vah skool prashasan ke gairajaruri adeshon par lagaam lagane ke liye kaam kar sakate hai, or bacchon kii samasyaon ke hal skool prashasan ke madhyam se khoj sakate hai jinako aksar jaanboojhkar nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 Schools also consider their duty as fulfilled by calling the parents to the parent teacher meeting
 or agar skool kii management cameti nahin sunati he to police court or sarkaar ke paas abhibhavak apni samasyaon ko likh sakate hai yaa sidhe sampark kar sakate hai
 But sometimes due to lack of information and sometimes reluctance, often parents are unable to tell the problems related to their children outside
 yani abhibhavakon kaa dakhal jab takskulonke bheetar nahin badhegaa, jab tak vah skulon par dabaav nahin daalenge tab tak aisi ghatnaon kii punrariti ko rokna mushkil hoga

 Asha, who has sung pop, cabaret, ghazals, bhajans and all kinds of songs during her time, said that in that era, even cabarets were not vulgar and special precaution was taken regarding the lyrics
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe yaad he ki ‘piya tu ab to aajaa’ main ek pankti thi ‘jiske liye chhu liye hai mere kadam’ or majaruuh sultanpuri gaanaa ricard hone se pehle hi jane lage ki bachche gaanaa sunenge to mai kya munh dikhaaungaa
 Asha, who has been awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award and the Padma Vibhushan Award, said, "I also don't want to sing songs like this that i have to be embarrassed in front of my grandchildren
" mujhe ab live sho ke jariye shrotaaon se sidhe judane main adhik majaa aata he

 Asha, who is making her acting debut through Marathi film 'my', also said that this is her first and last film
 unhone kaha, ‘yah film karne main mujhe bahut majaa aayaa lekin yah meri pehali or aakhri film he
 'at this stage of age, the very energetic Asha is also active in her restaurant business and is going to open a new outlet of Ashaj in Cairo in November

 After the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Wanike, the politics of the country's Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Kashmiri students have tried to read namaz-e-janaza, and the politics has been heated
 jammu-kashmir kii purv mukhyamantrimahabooba muftin centre se maamle hastkshep karne kii maang karne ke saath-saath kaha he ki chaatro ko apane saathi ko yaad karne kaa puraa haq he
 Former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti wrote in the tweet, 'the consequences of suppressing the voice of the students will not be good
 chaatro par se cese waapas liye jane par centre hastkshep kare or eemyu prashasan unka nilamban waapas le
 State governments outside Jammu and Kashmir should be sensitive to the situation, so as to prevent their isolation
 Pushing youth to the wall will be counter productive
 Center must intervene in withdrawing cases against students & AMU authorities must revoke their suspension
 The respective State governments outside JK should be sensitive to the situation & prevent further alienation 
 1 / 2 — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) October 15, 2018 Mehbooba Mufti further wrote, 'it would be wrong to punish students for remembering their classmates who are victims of continuous violence in Kashmir
 'it will be a travesty to punish them for remembering their former colleague who was a victim of relentless violence in Kashmir
 2 / 2— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) October 15, 2018 It is noteworthy that terrorist Mannan Wani was a phd student at AMU
 kuch dinon pehle soshal media par eke-47 ke saath uski ek tasviir saajha hui thi jiske baad uniwarsity prashasan ne mannaan ko nilambit kar diya tha

 Two students have been suspended in this case, while an FIR has been registered against 7 students

 'it is very unfortunate that students are wanting to leave midway
 AMU VC, teachers,hm Rajnath Singh and MHA officials should solve this issue

 Meanwhile, the GJM held rallies in different parts of the hilly region to demand a separate state

 Darjeeling was its focal point
 (input ieenes se) Prashant Kishore's journey took several turns in the last six years as an election strategist
 bijepi kaa 2012 gujarat campagne ho yaa 2014 loksabhaa chunaav, kishor ko narendra modi ke ranneetikaar ke taur par desh ne janaa
 Then also came the time that Kishore joined hands with the most ardent opponents of the BJP and first set up electoral board for him in Bihar and then UP
 yani kishor ne ek dashak se bhi kam vakt main bhartiya raajnneeti ke bade spectrum ko naap liya
 But it seems that Kishikor has made up his mind of 'gharwapsi' before the 2019 Mahakabakabale
 bijepi se jude sutron ke mutabik kishor thik vahiin pahunchate lagate hai jahaan se chah saal pehle unhone shuruyaat kii thi
 According to sources, like the former UN health specialist Kishore 2014, he can be seen advising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2019 campaign
 party main gahari paith rakhane vaale sutron kaa kahana he ki beete kuch maheenon main kishor kii pradhanmantri ke saath kai mulaakaat ho chuki hai, agle saal ke aam chunaav ke liye forward planning banane ke liye kishor kii pradhanmantri ke saath kuch mulaakaat nirdhaarit samay se bhi kahin zyada der tak chalin
 Sources say that Kishore has advised the BJP to give special emphasis on mobilizing the support of the youth
 kishor kaa maananaa he ki 2014 se pehle yuvaaon ko saath jodne ke liye jitani mehnat kii gai thi, vaisaa hi majboot conect ab kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Election strategist Kishore also seems to have forgotten the perceived differences of the past with NBJP chief Amit Shah
 sutron ke mutabik kishor kii shah ke saath bhi unke ghar par kai baithken hui hai
 One insider says, "if these two had decided to never work together forever, they would not have been having lunch and dinner together on many occasions
 agar pradhanmantri kehete hai ki sabhi ko mil kar kaam karnaa hoga to koi bhi pradhanmantri kii salaah se alag nahin ja saktaa
 After the 2014 general election, Kishore had demanded a higher position in the party, for which Amit Shah refused
 iske baad donon ke rishton main talkhi aa gai or kishor ne bijepi ke dhur virodhiyon se ranneetikaar ke taur par haath mila liya
 According to party sources, this time, Kishore has been made clear that his relationship with BJP will remain till the 2019 elections
 kishor ke nae sanghathan, I-PAC, ne is bich yuvaaon kii bhartee karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Its hashtag # nationalagendaforum is being associated with every tweet that says- 'the power to vote energizes the engine of democracy
 abhi vot den or 2019 kaa apana agenda set karen
 a theme of the 'I-PAC' is woven around the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 1869 main janme baapu kii 2019 main hi 150veen jayanti he
 Mahatma Gandhi's name is being used by the National Agenda Forum hashtag users on Twitter to connect the youth with them
 Gandhiji believed in the power of the youth to change the face of this country
 NAF is giving the youth the platform to effect change in this country

 So that Jaganmohan Reddy's chances of gaining power in Andhra Pradesh can be strengthened
 reddy kii loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bhi kishor kaa saath lene kii manshaa rahi
 Let us tell you that TDP was successful in gaining power in the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections after a thorn in Andhra Pradesh
 simandhra main tidipi ko wiesar congress se mahaj 2
 Only 06 per cent votes were received which gave it a decisive edge
 tidipi pehle endie main bijepi kii jodidar thi
 But earlier this year, the TDP severed ties with the NDA
 tidipi ne ye faisla rajya ko vishesh darja dene kii maang centre sarkaar kii ore se thukraa die jane ke baad liya
 Kishore has worked as a strategist in Punjab for JDU and Congress in Bihar
 haalanki uttar pradesh main congress ke liye sambhaavnaaen majboot karne kii koshish main ranneetikaar ke taur par kishor naakaam rahe
 However, sources related to Kishore blame the leadership of the Grand Old Party for the plight of the Congress in UP
 kishor ke ek sahyogi kaa kahana he, ‘agar congress ne priyanka gandhi ko upi main mukhyamantri ke liye apane chehre ke taur par pesh karne kii salaah ko maan liya hota to muslim ekamusth congress kii ore laut sakate the or wo chunaav jeet sakate the

 After the death of Kisunanda Pushkar, in which Swamy is accused, many flaws and negligence were taken by the police in the investigation of this case
 swami kaa aarope he ki isi vajah se ab takshashi tharuris maamle main bachate rahe
 Subramanian Swamy says that after coming to the Vigilance Report Court it will be clear which policemen made mistakes in the investigation after the death of Sunanda Pushkar
 darasal sunanda pushkar kii maut ke baad dilli police ne ek visilence cameti gathit kar is puure maamle kii tahakikat kii thi
 But this report of the Vigilance Committee was never made public by the police
 gauratlab patiala house court sunanda pushkar ke pati shashi tharur kii arji par sunwaayee kar rahaa he, jisamen maang kii gai he ki subramanyam swami ke dakhal ko is cese main khatm kiya jaae
 On the application of Shashi Tharoor, the Patiala House Court issued notice to Subramaniam Swamy in this matter and sought his response
 jisamen aaj swami kii taraf se pichley kuch maamalon se jude hue dastavej pesh kiye gaye
 On behalf of Swamy, an effort was made to make it clear in the court that his locus is formed in this case
 jabaki shashi tharur kii taraf se pesh vakil kaa kahana tha ki sunanda kii maut se jude is maamle main subramanyam swami kaa koi lenaa dena hi nahin he
 Therefore, all the applications filed by them on this matter should be dismissed

 shahid balwajise sibiai ne2ji spectrumghotale main giraftaar kiya he uskaa puraa sach aap janenge to chaunk jaaenge
 Shahid Balwa is considered to be the most important character in the 2G spectrum scam, while his name is also associated with the under world don Dawood Ibrahim
 itnaa hi nahin, forbs magazine jab bharat ke sabase amir logon kii list jari karti he to usamen bhi unka naam hota he
 Shahid Balwa, co-founder of the Dynamics Balvaz Group, or dbgroup, and promoter of DB Realty, is a person who is not easy to understand
 ye 2ji spectrum ghotaale ke mukhya sandigdh hai to anderworld don daud ibrahim se bhi inkaa conection hone kaa shaq in par kiya gaya he
 He is also one of the businessmen of the country, who is named in the list of the richest people in the country released by the prestigious Forbes magazine
 2ji spectrum ghotaale main shahid balava kaa naam sandigdhon kii suchi main sabase upar he to uski kai vajahen hai, ek to ye purv sanchaar mantri e raja ke kaaphi kareebi maane jate hai
 They have been related to former Communications Minister a Raja since 2004
 doosraa 2ji spectrum aavanton sabase zyada phayda inhi kii company swaan telecom ko mila swaan telecom ko sirf 1537 karod main 13 cirkil ke license mil gaye
 Shahid Balwa is trapped in the 2G spectrum scam, and there is a long-standing suspicion of connection with Dawood Ibrahim
 kaha jaataa he ki yuai kii jis ettishlaat company ko balava ne apni company swaan telecom kaa 45 fisadi steke bechaa us ettishlaat company kaa acha khaasaa steke pakistan telecom korporation limited main bhi he jo ki ek tarah se iesai kii hi nigaraanee main rahata he
 Property of Balwa 1 in 2010
 06 kharab america dollar thi or inkaa naam forbs kii sabase amiron kii list main 66wein number par tha
 But after allegations of connection with Dawood and then the name of 2G spectrum scam, Balwa's respect has got in the mud
 iviem hack karne ke liye chunaav ayog kii sharton se aam aadmi party khush nahi he
 The Commission has on June 3 challenged all political parties to hack evms
 iviem hack karne kaa mauka unheen raajnneetik dalon ko milegaa jo 26 may kii shaam 5 baje tak hekathon ke liye registration karavaaenge
 The Aam Aadmi Party had submitted a demand letter to the Election Commissioner on 24 May questioning the challenge of the Election Commission's hacking
 'aap' ne maang kii thi ki 3 june ko iviem se chhedchhad yamdar board cobadalakar hack karne kii anumati di jaae
 AAP leader Sanjay Singh had said that the party will clarify whether it will participate in the hackathon on June 3 only after the reply from the Election Commissioner
 philhal chunaav ayog ne aam aadmi party kii maangon ko puri tarah se nakaar diya he
 On which 'AAP' leader Sanjay Singh has expressed resentment by tweeting
 EC ko apane safeguard par bharosa he,ye he safe game, EC ne kaha tha motherboard badalane par EVM kaam nahi karegaa,ec mauqaa de,kaam nahi kiya,to ham galatavpiche

 co / 3mzrezfxci — Sanjay Singh AAP (@sanjayazadsln) May 25, 2017 Obviously the Aam Aadmi Party is not satisfied with the conditions of the Election Commission
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki dilli vidhansabha main dami iviem hack karne vaali aam aadmi party, haikathan main hissaa legi yaa nahi? philhal to isaki sambhaavna kam hi lag rahi he
 Significantly, after the elections of five states in the last months and before that, questions have been raised on EVM
 jahaan kai vipakshi partiyaan is par hamalavar rahi hai
 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party legislator Saurabh Bhardwaj also showed a symbolic EVM hacked within the Delhi Assembly
 isse chunaav ayog bhi dabaav main hai or sabakuch saaf karnaa chahta he
 While clean India is being talked about in the whole country, it seems to be the opposite in the railways
 ek angreji akhbaar ne khabar di he ki dilli se kerala aane-jane valitrenkerala express ke toilet main baqayada khaane-pine kaa saamaan rakhaa jaataa he
 Apart from this train, this type of work is done in many more trains and there is no concern about the health of the passengers, due to which a large number of passengers fall ill
 akhbaar ne dakshin railway kii kai trainon ke bare main bataaya he ki gande dhang se khaanaa rakhane ke alaava badboodaar waiter khaanaa paroste hai jinke sharir se durgandh aati he
 The result of such mess is that 50 passengers of ajmer-ernakulam Marusagar Express got food poisoning due to eating such dirty food and they were admitted to the hospital on the way
 aisa nahin he ki sirf dakshin bharat kii trainon main gandagi hoti he, purv rail kaa to isamen koi jawaab nahin he
 Dirty trains, dirty toilets are common
 toilet main pani na hona ek aam shikaayat he
 Same is the situation here in the matter of food
 dilli se ranchi aane-jane vaali rajdhani express ke khaane kii to sabase zyada shikaayat hoti he
 Once, an MP reached the hospital after eating his food
 nai sarkaar ke aane ke baad rail yatriyon main kuch ummid bandhi thi lekin usamen koi pragati nahin hui he or railway ke daawey jyon ke tyon hai

 yah notice congress or vipakshi partiyon kii ore se diya gaya tha, jise rajyasabha ke sabhapati or uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The number six judge will preside, this special bench will be presided over in seniority order by sixth justice Arjan Kumar Sikri
 inke alaava justise sharad arvind bobade, justise envi ramana, justise arun mishra or justise adarsh kumaar goyal peeth main shaamil rahenge

 ajtak kachi coloniyaan pakki nahin ho pai hai
 Also, a conspiracy is going on in Delhi against the BJP, which also includes the Delhi chief and the Congress state president
 tiwari ne kaha ki dilli main bhukh se betiyaan mar rahi hai or dilli sarkaar bangladeshi-rohingya kaa saath de rahi he
 The party is focusing on Delhi and Lok Sabha elections through the Purvanchalis
 is samudaay ke logon ne pichley saal nagar nigam ke chunaavon main party ko samarthan diya tha
 According to an estimate in Delhi, 40 percent of the total voters are Purvanchali voters

 Now the world of television serials has moved from the luxurious atmosphere of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi and Mumbai to the unseen world of Begusarai in Bihar, Jamshedpur, Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Mathura, Agra and Bhopal and Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh
 haal main andtiwi par shuru hue begusarai ke diarector ravindra gautam kehete hai, "audiens nayaapan chaahate hai
 Large metros like Delhi, Mumbai have been seen a lot
 hindustan main har shahar kaa apana culture he
 This same talk and newness is pulling the directors and producers towards the places which were untouched till now
 "bharat main privet channelon kaa udai or serial industry apni yuvavastha main he
 Satellite TV in the country started in the late 1990s
 tab se lekar ab tak isamen kai badlaav darj ho chuke hai
 Where once the Gujarati family and Rajasthani splendor were its subjects, now the picture has changed
 vartmaan main lagbhag darjan bhar dharawahik aise hai jo uttari bharat ke vibhinn shaharon par aadhaarit hai
 Arvind Babbal, producer-director of Life ok's serial Mahakumbh, says, "I shot my serial in Banaras
 yahaan to ek industry hi khadi ho gai he
 It has every facility in Mumbai
 log bhi profeshnal hai
 "for places like Lucknow and Banaras, movement has become easier and there is also better airline
 diarector maanate hai ki in jagahon par fresh frem bhi milte hai
 Babbal says, "banaras has changed completely now
 " sambhawatah uttar bharat ko dekhne kaa mumbai kaa najariya bhi
 One reason for this is that the arrival of such people in the industry is also being considered, who are from small cities and have reached this point after a long struggle
 inhen logon ke shahar or sangharsh tivi par najar aa rahaa he
 Begusarai's author Anshuman Sinha is himself from Bihar
 is serial main kaam kar rahe narendra jha bhi bihar se hi hai
 Gautam says, "I am from Lucknow myself
 maine pratigya 2008 main banaaya tha jo elahabaad aadhaarit tha
 As such, both the TV and film industry have increased the interference of the people of small cities in North India
 "gaanv-dehaat kaa tiarapy gemin dharawahikon main uttar bharat ke chote shaharon ke najar aane kii ek vajah tiarapy ko mana ja rahaa he nchayonki tivi or satellite channelon kii pahunch dur-duuraj tak ho gai he
 The means of entertainment there are less than in big cities
 is vajah se tivi ek bada madhyam ban jaataa he
 Says Babbal, "TV is a great source of entertainment in towns and villages and serials play an important role in it
 mahakumbh uttar bharat main khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 "not only this, according to a FICCI-KPMG report, 16 in India till 2013
 1 karod gharon main televijan tha jabaki 2018 tak iske 19
 1 crore tax is expected to reach
 2013 ke in gharon main 86 fisadi ke yahaan cabel or satellite channel the to 2018 main yah aankada 95 fisadi par pahunch jayega
 In this way the reach of TV and channels will give rise to new viewers and new stories
 asli jindagi or shaharon se jude in dharawahikon ko apane content kii originelity par khaas dhyaan dena hoga varanaa adhakachari chijen jaayaka bigaad sakati hai
 Anyway, most of the early episodes of the serials are being shot at respective places
 baaki set par shoot hota he
 With daily soaps this compulsion persists, but fakeness should not be too much
 begusarai kii bhashaa ko lekar bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki usamen bhojpuri kaa tach nahin he
 Gautam says, "language has to be kept in such a way that everyone understands it
 hamane local lahaza rakhaa he
 "this is just the beginning of the journey to these unknown cities
 abhi to kai mukaam tay kiye jane baaki hai

 iske liye kareeb 1,200 karod rupee kaa bajet he or 55 dinon main yahaan kareeb 10 karod shraddhaluon ke pahunchane kii ummid he
 Tough arrangements have been made for the living, food and security of crores of people in the harsh winter
 apane aap main kai khubiyaan, vividhta or vishistataa liye tirthraj prayag kaa mahakumbh mela vaaki duniya kii kisi bhi event company or prabandhan guru ke liye ek ajooba or shodh kaa vishay he
 This is the reason that the management gurus and research students of the Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) School of Management Studies, Allahabad have decided to conduct research on devotees, saints and businessmen
 emenenity main skool of management studies ke associat professor tanuj nandan kehete hai ki duniya bhar ke prabandhan visheshgy kumbh ke aayojan se kaaphi kuch sikh sakate hai
 Giving protection to prominent personalities in Kumbh, controlling the crowds of crores of devotees, settling a new city to live is truly praiseworthy
 yahi kaaran he ki harvard or oxford jaise vishvavidhyalayon ke shodh chaatr yahaan mahakumbh par shodh karne ke liye aane vaale hai
 Department head Piyush Ranjan Aggarwal told, 'in research we will try to know how much a common devotee spends, what is the social and economic level of the devotees
 shodh main sadhu-santon kii madad bhi lee jaaegi
 For this, a team of 100 teachers and researchers will work in Kumbh
 shodhakarya ko paanch bhaagon main baanta gaya he-vitt, marketing, soochna evam vyavastha, saamaajik or aarthik str va maanav sansaadhan
 Aggarwal says that the aim is to give the management students a close look at the country's economy and social and economic status

 This will be the ground experience for management students
 bollywood ke 100 karod club ke raja salmaan khan akasar majaak karte hai ki ve apane dost aamir khan kii film '3 idiyats' kaa box offis record nahin tod paae
 Now call it the misfortune of the meeting or something that Shahrukh Khan disliked them
 shahrukh kii film 'chennai express' ne '3 idiyats' kaa record todate hue 212 karod rupee (26 agast tak) kii kamai kar lee he
 202 before this
 47 karod ke bijness ke saath '3 idiyats' bharat main sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film thi
 But 'chennai Express' director Rohit Shetty is not among those who try to capitalize on his success
 film ko box offis par mil rahe itane badhiya rispons ke bare main rohit kehete hai, 'main bahut khush hum ki film itnaa acha kar rahi he or bijness bhi badhiya hua he
 But it's silly when someone says that you have broken the record of '3 Idiots'
 ''main on record kahana chahta hum ki '3 idiyats' ek mahaan film he
 You cannot compare '3 Idiots' to 'chennai' Express
 haa, meri film ne '3 idiyats' ke bijness ko cross kar liya he
 But it looks like we are claiming that 'chennai Express' is more good and great
 yah betuki baat he
 If '3 Idiots' were released today, it would have done business of 235 crores or 240 crores
 'kamedi or ection se bharpoor shahrukh kii film 'chennai express' ko bharat hi nahin, balki videshi darshakon ne bhi haathon haath liya
 What's more, the second big film 'once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobara', released a week later, did not attract the audience
 milind lutheriya nirdeshit akshay kumaar or imran khan starer yah film do hafton main 57
 Could do business of Rs 5 crore only
 mjedaar baat yah he ki donon hi filmon 'chennai express' or 'vans apon e time in mumbai dobaaraa' ko film samikshakon se saraahna nahin mili thi
 Despite this, Shah Rukh outpaced many of his competitors
 gauratlab he ki '3 idiyats' 23 disambar 2009 ko relies hui thi
 And it took three and a half years for a Bollywood film to break its record
 vaise abhi se trade panditon main is baat ko lekar bahes shuru ho gai he ki ab koun si film shahrukh kii 'chennai express' kaa record todegi
 Hrithik Roshan's 'krrish 3' and Aamir Khan starrer 'dhoom 3' released this year are being considered as hot contenders

 "private sector companies expect this stock to be more than 2 lakh tonnes
 sodhi kehete hai," agar bazaar se 50 hajaar ton maal kii bhi khapat ho jaae to bazaar main keemten sudhar jaaengi
 However, the next three to four months are in lean season, in which consumption will be more than production
 isse sthiti main kuch sudhaar jarur aayega
 It is also important to understand that if the available stock is not consumed in the market before the start of the crush season after November 15, this crisis can be deepened

 global market main milk powder kaa maujuuda bhav 135 se 140 rupye prati kilo he jabaki bharat main milk powder kii laagat 180 se 190 rupye prati kilo he
 Therefore, this stock of milk powder has become standing due to sluggish exports for the last 3 years

 dhawan ne court se kaha ki aise gaiyr-anukool maahaul main bahes karnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Dhawan told the court that a minister in UP has said that Ayodhya belongs to Hindus, the temple belongs to him and the Supreme Court also belongs to him
 main avmaananaa ke baad avmaananaa daayar nahin kar saktaa
 He has already filed contempt against the 88-year-old man

 desh main aisa nahin hona chahie
 We rule out such statements
 donon paksh bina kisi dar ke apni daleelein adaalat ke samaksh rakhane ke liye swatantra hai

 Rajiv Dhawan said that the Constitution Bench has to consider two main points

 Rajiv Dhawan, citing a judgment of the Supreme Court in 1962, questioned the High Court's decision and said that the mistake which could not be sustained, should be done under the law
 dhawan ne kaha tha ki adaalat main yah sabit kiye jane ki koshish kii jaati rahi he ki jameen pehle hindu pakshakaron ke adhikaar main thi
 Assuming the court has been convinced that is not fair
 unhone hindu paksh ke daawey par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki 'kya ramalala virajman kah sakate hai ki us jameen par malikana haq unka he? nahin, unka malikana haq kabhi nahin rahaa he

 ''input - bhashaa Just a week after the Pulwama terror attack, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala has launched a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi government
 surajevaala ne guuruuvaar subah press conference kar kaha ki jis dauraan pulavama main aatanki hamalaa hua tha, tab pradhanmantri gym corbett main film kii shooting kar rahe the
 During this time, the Congress raised 5 big questions on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and also targeted his ministers
 congress ne pradhanmantri se puche 5 sawaal


1
 Why do Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval not accept responsibility for their failure? 2
 pulavama hamale main istemaal hua itnaa visphotak, rocket launture kahaan se aae, vaahan ne vahaan kaise pravesh kiya?3
 Why was the threatening video released just 48 hours before the Pulwama terror attack ignored? 4
 siarpief ne agar hawaii yatra kii maang kii thi, to unki maang ko kyon nahin mana gaya?5
 During the 56-month tenure of the Modi government, 488 jawans have been martyred, why have the terrorist attacks not stopped with demonetisation? Not just sharp questions but Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala targeted the Congress with many evidences
 unhone is dauraan pradhanmantri modi ke gym corbett daure par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Surjewala said that 3 on 14 February
 10 baje pulavama main aatanki hamalaa hua, lekin pradhanmantri shaam paune saat baje tak gym corbett main film kii shooting karte rahe the
 He said that the Prime Minister was having tea snack in Ramnagar even after the attack, greeting his supporters
 surajevaala ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah lagaataar chunavi reliyaan kar rahe hai or pulavama aatanki hamale par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 During the funeral of the martyrs, BJP Netarandeep Surjewala was seen laughing and showed the picture of BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj and Modi Cabinet Minister KJ Alphons during this time
 isamen sakshi maharaj pulavama hamale main shahid hue jawan ke antim sanskaar main hansate hue dikh rahe hai to vahiin keje alphons shahid vivi vasantkumar taabut main rakhe parthiv sharir ke saath selfi lete hue dikh rahe the
 The Congress attacked the Modi government with these questions
 surajevaala ne kaha ki aaj jab puraa desh shok manaa rahaa he, to pradhanmantri modi south korea main saiyr-sapata kar rahe hai
 He also asked why the Prime Minister did not declare national mourning after the Pulwama attack, did he not want to stop the inauguration of the projects he was doing continuously
 aapako bataa den ki 14 farvari ko pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main 40 jawan shahid hue the, jiske baad media ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bayaan diya tha ki unki party agle kuch dinon tak raajnneetik bayaan nahin degi
 Now exactly seven days later, Congress has stepped up to question the government
 rajd supremeo lalu prasad ne desh main maujuud vartmaan sankat ke liye congress ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki sankat kii ghadi main jab koi congress ke saath nahin tha to ve akele uski madad ko aage aae the or aaj vahi congress bihar se unke safaya main juty he
 While welcoming JDU leader Dr
 Fayyaz Ahmad from Madhubani's Bisfi in Patna's RJD state office to join the RJD, he alleged that even after 63 years of India's independence, what the Congress has done for the people of the country did
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki desh kii vartmaan peedi ke saamne aaj jo bhi samasyaayein munh baae khadi hai, uske liye congress jimmedaar he
 The RJD supremo said, 'in the hour of crisis when no one was with the Congress and BJP and RSS used to call Sonia Gandhi a foreigner
 aise samay main kisi congressi netaa ne munh nahin kholaa par ham bina kisi laalach ke bole ki koun bolta he ki sonia gandhi videshi hai
 She is the daughter-in-law of India and we will make her the Prime Minister
 ’ lalu ne kaha ki congress unka adarsh nahin he kyonki apatkaal ke dauraan congress kii nitiyon kaa virodh karne par hi ve misa ke tahat ek saal jail main rahe the
 He said that BJP is only a mask but the real face behind it is the Sangh Parivar, which is opposed to Islam like America
 isliye centre or uttar pradesh sahit desh ke anya rajyon se bhaajapa ko satta se baahar karne ke liye vamadal, samaajawaadee dal or congress ekajute hue the
 Alleging that the Congress had met with the BJP, Lalu said that now the same Congress is trying to end their existence in Bihar
 rajd supremeo ne kaha ki chunaav ke samay main vibhinn dalon dwaara tarah-tarah kaa pralobhan diya jayega or afvaah failaayaa jayega, lekin us par dhyaan nahin dena he
 He said that people who think about the Congress party are from any community
 unhen unki yah salaah he or ve unhen aagaah kar rahe hai ki congress ko majboot karnaa bhaajapa ko majboot karnaa hoga
 Lalu said that there are different types of discussions, but he does not want to get into these discussions nor does he want to give his response today
 unhone kaha ki chunaav to aate jate rahete hai, lekin unki party desh main bhaichara or sadbhaavna ke maahaul ko kharaab karne main lagi sampradayik takatein apni jaden nahin jamaa sake
 They will continue to strive for this
 mahila vidheyak ke jariye prakhar netaaon ko sansad or vidhansabhaon se baahar karne kii sajeesh rachane kaa congress par aarope lagaate hue rajd pramukh ne kaha ki congress aisa kiske ishaare par kar rahi he
 They do not know about it, but they will not accept it in its present form under any circumstances and why should the government not lift them out of Parliament with the help of army-police
 unhone kaha ki rajd mahilaon ke virdohi nahin hai balki unki party ne suzav diya he ki centre is bill ko laae par usamen muslim, pichhadi jati or dalit sahit garib mazdooree karne vaali mahilaon ko aarakshan dene kaa praavdhaan kare

 The death of 17 people burnt by fire in Bawana, Delhi has raised the question of how such a big accident happened
 saath hi charchaa is baat ko lekar bhi he ki aakhir ghatana ke prati javabdehi kiski he
 This is because the government in Delhi belongs to the Aam Aadmi Party and the municipal corporation is ruled by the BJP
 aise main praathmik taur par jo laaparvaahee saamne aa rahi hai, uske liye koun jimmedaar he, philhal ye bahes kaa vishay he
 The police have arrested the factory owner in this case
 saath hi police ne apni tafteesh jari kar di he
 Police is currently pursuing the investigation in Bawana area based on factory rules
 isamen kuch ahm baaten saamne ai hai
 In fact, illegal factories in Shahadra area of delhi were shifted to Bawana Industrial Area
 iske liye dilli rajya audyogic evam infrastracchar vikaas nigam yani DSIIDC ne kareeb 10 hajaar factriyon ko bavana industrial aria main jameen muhaiyaa karai thi
 These lands were given during the Sheela government
 - DSIIDC dilli sarkaar ke adheen aata he, lekin jin factory maalikon ko jaminen di gai thim, unhen factory chalaane ke liye nagar nigam se license lenaa hota he or emsidi par lambey samay se bijepi kaa shashan chalata aa rahaa he
 - Factory owners are required to take 2 licenses from MCD
 pehla license niyamon ke mutabik building nirmaan ke liye lenaa hota he
 But this was not done
 ise lekar lalit goyal kii bhoomika kii police jaanch kar rahi he
 - Second license has to be taken to run the factory
 lekin police kii giraft main maujuud factory maalik manoj jain ne apane bayaan main bataaya he kicold craikar factory(jaise stage pataakhe) chalaane ke liye kisi license kii jarurat nahin thi
 In addition to the breach in the licensing process, it has also been found in the investigation that the factory owner did not even take fire NOC
 philhal, dilli sarkaar ne bhi maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party is blaming the BJP and the MCD for the accident, while the BJP is directly blaming Delhi's Keerwind Kejriwal
 donon partiyon ke bich aarope-pratyarope kaa daur bhi chal rahaa he

 Political mercury has suddenly risen after a pornographic video of a former minister surfaced in Kerala
 yah video ek televijan channel par prasaarit hua, jiske baad unase vidhayak pad se istipha dene kii maang uthne lagi he
 In the video, he is shown with a woman
 video main dekhi gai mahila ne police ko die bayaan main kaha he ki na keval vidhayak jose thettyil, balki unke bete ne bhi unka ek baar nahin, kai baar yon shoshan kiya
 Police has registered a case against father-son in this case
 udhar, thettyil ne mana ki vah mahila ko lambey samay se jaanate hai, lekin unhone uske saath kisi bhi tarah ke galat aacharan se inkaar kiya
 Following the revelations of the case, the Congress-led ruling United Democratic Front took out a march and demonstrated
 lekin hairaani kii baat yah he ki yah mudda is saptaah kii shuruyaat main hui left democratic front kii baithak main nahin uthaa
 Its convenor, Vaikom Viswan, said the issue was never discussed, as police are investigating the matter
 thettyil kii party janata dal-secular ne bhi unka saath dene kaa faisla kiya he
 In such a situation, speculation has intensified about whether he will be arrested
 atakalein is baat ko lekar bhi lagaai ja rahi hai ki kya vah naitikta ke aadhaar par vidhayak ke pad se istipha denge?puure maamle main sabase adhik hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki yah video swayan shikayatakarta mahila ne banaai he
 He says that initially Jose's son promised to marry him, but later father-son together exploited him physically, after which he installed secret cameras in his room
 police kaa kahana he ki ghatana pichley saal kii he
 The woman kept these videos with her for several months
 lekin jab jose or unke bete ne unhen nazarandaaj kar diya to usne video or 15pannon kii shikaayat ke saath police se sampark kiya
 As the dead bodies of the children killed in the terrorist attack on the Army Public School were growing, anger and mourning in Pakistan was getting tightened
 ashk or dard se phija baari ho chuki thi
 Some people had left for Peshawar only to be able to live with the Gamzada families
 main skool main agali subah pahunchi
 On that wintry and misty morning, the school campus from nursery to class 12 was haunted by silence
 hawa baari or thami hui thi
 Something was visible, just rows of military trucks and journalists with their cameras
 ek seedhi ke neeche meri mulaakaat apni ek sahakarmi se hui
 She was crying
 ye sidhiruaan us auditorium tak jaati thim jise nau dehshatgardon ne bujadkaane main tabdeel kar diya tha
 i started climbing stairs
 har taraf khun bikharaa hua tha
 On the wall of the auditorium i saw a school moto written, We Shall Rise and Shine
 aathven, nauven or dasven darje ke bachche jab golibari se bachakar yahaan se nikalne kii koshish kar rahe honge, to unhone hi apane juute, kitaaben or jacketen yahaan chhod di hongi
 This stuff was scattered everywhere
 har konaa khun ke mote thakkon se pata padaa tha
 Was getting furious with frozen blood
 main stabdh thi
 Fear gripped me
 mere aansu rukne kaa naam nahin le rahe the
 
 
 It was here that the terrorists turned their laughter, their joy, their hopes and enthusiasm into shouts of shouting and saving lives
 in khubasurat masuumon ko dil todgaye vaali ek aisi jang main jhonk diya gaya tha jo gaiyr-barabari or ninsaphi kaa intiha thi
 In the same auditorium, around 250 children of eight, nine and tenth class had gathered to take training in first aid
 ek faujee doctor ne bamushkil apana lacture in lafjon ke saath shuru hi kiya tha, ‘‘allaah ke naam par, jo sab pe raham karata he
 
 
 '', That the children heard the sound of bullets firing
 ujali or halke rang kii salwar-kameez pahane kareeb nau noujvaan haul main ghus aae the or unhone bachein par goliyaan chalaani shuru kar di thim
 He had raised the slogan of Allah o Akbar before firing bullets
 allaah ke naam par koi bhi jang itani dardanaak nahin rahi hogi-jisamen ek taraf doctor tha to duusari ore shaitan
 Some of the features in this slaughterhouse were heart-breaking — the floor was stained with blood, the corner in the hall was the one where a coward blew himself
 ek teacher kaa kaala goun farsh par padaa maano kah rahaa tha, ‘‘dekho, main apana kaam karte hue shahid hua
 "A red scarf with folds was wrapped in a chair that a mother would have lovingly tied around her son's neck that morning
" teesri qatari main ek jodi hare rang ke juute pade the, jo us subah kisi maasoom ke pairon main rahe honge
 Fawad is still in the hospital
 vah pehali qatari main isi haul main tha lekin apni kursi ke neeche chhip gaya tha
 He was shot in the arms and legs
 uske sabase achche dost ke sir main goli lagi
 Fawad has seen his Magaz coming out with his eyes
 nauveen darje kaa junain jaanghon or panjon mans goli lagane ke baavjood isliye batch gaya kyonki vah jahaan gira, vahaan khun kaa talab tha or usne pade-pade mare hone kaa naatak kiya
 He said that he had to struggle a lot to get out of the hall later
 aspataal main doctor khud is baat se pareshaan the ki unke donon bachche jinda hai yaa nahin
 They were engaged in the injuries of injured children but were from the lost
 ek or doctor kii ankhon main aansu the
 He almost cried, complaining that he had taken photographs of vips, which led to "at least seven of my children being gone, all i had to do was put a tube inside them and they would all have survived
" ’’ har koi ro rahaa tha
 a crying teacher of Mardan wanted to live with the children in shock
 quick rispons force ke ek sipaahi ne bataaya ki usne skool ke pados se uthte dhuen kii jaankaree control room ko kareeb 10 bajkar 20 minute par di thi
 This smoke was rising from the residential area which was east of a green strip along the boundary of the school
 aatanki jis car se aae the, use unhone phoonk diya tha or esamaji kaa khyal kiye bagaiyr 12 foot oonchi skool kii diwaar par chadh gaye the jis par kantedaar baad lagi thi
 As soon as this soldier reached the place of smoke, he heard the sound of gunfire
 usne control room ko aagaah kiya or 20 minute baad 15 logon ke saath usne auditorium main aatankiyon par dhaava bolaa
 The firing between the army's commando force and regular units and the militants forced the militants to take refuge in the adjacent administrative section
 puri tarah jal chuke daftar, toote hue daravaaje, baalo ke guchchhe or ceiling par chhitaka khun is baat kii gavaahi de rahaa he ki chaar aatankiyon ke khud ko uda lene ke baad vahaan kya manjar rahaa hoga
 He had such a stock of weapons that we believe, he came here at three o'clock in the morning to spot him and he kept his weapons hidden here
 warsaw road par hue is katleam ke baad pakistan ab hameshaa ke liye badal chukaa he
 Pakistan will no longer be the same in tackling terrorists
 avam main machi cheekh-pukaar, siyasatdanon kii ekajutata, faansee par lagi roak ko hataane kaa wajire-ajam kaa faisla, 51 aatankiyon ko faansee die jane kaa faisla, apana dharna khatm kar sarkaar ke aatank virdohi abhiyaanon main saath aane kaa imran khan kaa faisla, fouj kii yah saarvajanik ghoshnaa ki koi aatanki acha yaa bura nahin hota
 The army chief met the Afghan president on the evidence that the conspiracy to massacre our children was hatched in Kunar — all these indications are that the scope of a new Pakistan still exists where there is no softening of terrorism Will be treated main jab skool se nikal rahi thi to ek roti hui aurat ne desh ke hukmaranon ke liye, netaaon ke liye, mujhase apana sandesh bhijwaya tha, ‘‘khuda ke liye unhen jaakar kah do ki bas, bahut ho chukaa

 Will reach close to bataa den ki film 'kalank' (kalank) ko samikshakon se mix rivyuu mili the or film ko har kisi ne ausat bataaya tha
 In this way, the film was considered a crisis due to the lack of good reviews of the film
 lekin film ne pehle din dhamaakedaar kamai karke sabko chaunkaa diya
 The box office collection of 'kalank' will also be seen in the coming days as word to mouth will work a lot in the case of the film

 jhooth bolne kii vajah se finland ke pradhanmantri anti rine (antti Rinne) ko istipha dena padaa he lekin hamaare yahaan to sarkaar banane or chunaav jeetne ke liye netaa anginat jhooth bolte hai
 Here politics starts with lies
 finland ke pradhanmantri ne desh main chal rahi postal strike ko lekar sansad ko gumraah kiya tha
 His lies were caught and he had to resign
 november ke maheene main hajaaron kii sankhya main finland ke state postal sarvice ke karmchaaree sadak par utre
 This performance went on for about two weeks
 pradarshan ke peeche mukhya vajah thi unki varking condishan main badlaav or vetan main katautee
 When the Postal Service employees of Finland came on the road, many other organizations also came on the road to accompany them
 finland kaa transport department bhi pradarshan main shaamil hua
 Within three days, 300 flights to Finland were canceled when Air Line employees joined the demonstration
 krooj, jahaaz bhi port par khadey rah gaye
 There was an atmosphere of chaos in Finland
 27 november ko gavarning board ko karmchaariyon ke saamne jhukna padaa or kaaryakari sthiti main badlaav or tankhwaah main katautee ko lekar jo prastaav diya gaya tha use waapas lenaa padaa
 The Finland PM said in Parliament on 28 November that the government did not want a change in executive status and any pay cuts but the Governing Board of Postal Services wanted a change in any situation
 finland ke pradhanmantri ke bayaan ke baad postal sarvice ke gavarning board ke cheirperson ne kaha ki pradhanmantri sansad ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 The government never opposed the proposal for change of executive position and cut salary
 jab finland ke pradhanmantri kaa jhooth pakadaa gaya to vipaksh sansad main hangaamaa karne laga or piem ko istifa dena padaa
 Six months ago Antti Rinne became the PM of Finland
 rine kii party ke paas purna bahumat nahin he, chaar anya partiyon ke samarthan se ve sarkaar chalaa rahe the jisamen centre party bhi shaamil thi
 The Center Party said that the Prime Minister of Finland has lost faith and it is no longer possible to trust him
 iske baad rine ko istifa dena padaa
 Now who will become Prime Minister in Finland remains to be seen
 vaise bhi central party nahin chaahati he ki desh main chunaav ho
 The Center Party will continue its support to Rinne's Social Democratic Party
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri banane kii res main soshal democratic party kii sannaa marine (sanna Marin) sabase aage hai
 The Marine is 34 years old
 agar ve pradhanmantri banati hai to finland ke itihaas main ve sabase kam umr kii pradhanmantri hongi
 This is not the first time that a prime minister of Finland has had to give up his chair due to lies
 san 2003 main centre party ke pradhanmantri Anneli Jaatteenmaki ne jhooth bolaa tha or kursi chhodana padi thi
 In 2015, Finland Prime Minister Alexander Stubb had to apologize in Parliament for lying, although his chair survived
 us samay Stubb ne kaha tha ki 90 pratishat export manaate hai ki unki taraf se diya gaya band polisy kaa prastaav sakaaratmak tha, jabaki aisa nahin tha
 Has any leader in our country ever left his post because of lying, or apologized? Seems like this has never happened, and there is no possibility of it happening any further
 hamaare yahaan ke netaa jhooth bolne or gumraah karne ke baad yahi kehete hai ki unke bayaan ko galat sandarbh main liya gaya
 IT cells have been formed here to win elections, which keep spreading lies
 galati sirf netaaon kii nahin, yahaan kii janata kii bhi he
 If the public is ready to be stupid, then the leaders are fooling
 hindu-muslim dibet main log khush hai
 People clap when leaders lie at election rallies
 chunaav khatm ho jate hai to logon ko samasyaayein yaad aati hai
 During the election, there is love for its leader
 janata stechu ban jane par zyada khush najar aati he, jabaki uske liye aspataal zyada myne rakhata he
 Even today, demonstrations are being held in many places in Delhi
 chunaav ke baad agar sarkaar nahin sunati he to dabaav banane ke liye pradarshan ek jariya ho saktaa he, lekin sabase badi baat he ki aap kis mudde par vot de rahe hai
 People see who is the prime ministerial candidate
 yah nahin dekhte hai ki jis saansad ko vot dekar jita rahe hai vah thik he yaa nahin? jab samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hota he to pradarshan karne ke liye jantar mantar pahunch jate hai
 First of all, you should sit in front of your MP and mla's house
 saansad or vidhayak ko majaboor karnaa chahie ki vah unke mudde ko sansad yaa vidhansabha main uthaae
 If the leader does not raise the issue, then close the door when you come to ask for votes in the next election
 logon ko khud ke liye khud kii ladaai main shaamil hona padegaa
 Coming to Delhi and demonstrating does not make everything right, neither the government listens nor the media
 media ko tiarapy chahie
 The performance of ordinary people can never be a topic of TRP for the media
 jis tivi screen par aam log dikhnaa chahie vahaan netaaon kii shakl or bite dikhaai detii he
 That is why people need to change themselves
 khud ko uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri va kaddavar netaa kalyaan singh kaa raajnneetik vaaris bataane vaali madhya pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri va bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii netaa uma bharti kaa mahoba janapad ke charkhaari vidhansabha kshetra main jald hi kalyaan se saamana hoga
 Uma will have to work hard to ensure her victory from here
 unhen yahaan na keval kalyaan singh ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, balki apni hi birdari ke sthaneey kaddavar netaaon se bhi jujhna hoga
 The Election Commission has generalized Charkhari for the first time in the new delimitation
 charkhaari vidhansabha kshetra main 38 hajaar matadaata lodhi birdari ke hai or yah lodhi bahul seat ho gai he
 Lodhi Dhruvaram Chaudhary, a four-time MLA from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) from the adjacent Rath Assembly seat, is also contesting from Charkhari, while Samajwadi Party (SP) has nominated another local strongman from Lodhi Samaj, Kaptan Singh Rajput 
 vahiin, congress ne pichde varg se raamjivan yadav par daanv lagaaya he
 Kalyan Singh, the former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, has a strong hold in the Rath and Charkhari regions
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main raath se unki party ke ummidavaar ne dhruvraam choudhary ke daant khattey kar die the
 From this, it can be guessed that Kalyan Singh will be charmed in Charkhari
 kalyaan singh ne buudhvaar ko farukhabad main ghoshnaa kii ki vah charkhaari main uma ke khilaaf jansabha karenge
 The comments uma ne pichley dinon lakhanu main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha tha, "main bhaajapa main kalyaan kaa vikalp nahin hum
 He is a great and great leader who is like my father
 " ram mandir andolan main kalyaan or uma ne aguva kii bhoomika nibhaai thi or uske baad se donon ne har raajnneetik ladaai main ek-duusare kaa saath diya
 Political strategist Ranveer Singh Chauhan says, "there will be a split of Lodhi votes in Charkhari
 chunaav kaa puraa daaromadar 36 fisadi dalit maton par tikaa hua he
 Overall, where Uma Bharti will face opposition from her fraternity's former Chief Minister Kalyan Singh
 vahiin birdari ke hi sthaneey kaddavar netaaon ke chakravyuuh or rahul kii yuva takat ko todane ke liye bhi baari mashkkat kerani hogi
 " uma ko yahaan se apni jeet sunishchit karne ke liye baari mashkkat kerani hogi
 Not only will he have to face Kalyan Singh's opposition here, but he will also have to grapple with local leaders of his own fraternity
 nirvachan ayog ne nae parisemen main pehali baar charkhaari ko saamaanya kiya he
 There are 38 thousand voters in Lodhi fraternity in Charkhari assembly constituency and it has become a Lodhi dominated seat
 bagal kii raath vidhansabha seat se bahujan samaaj party (basapa) se chaar baar vidhayak rahe lodhi dhruvraam choudhary bhi charkhaari se chunaav lard rahe hai, jabaki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ne lodhi samaaj ke ek anya sthaneey kaddavar netaa captain singh rajput ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 At the same time, the Congress has placed a bet on Ramjeevan Yadav from the backward class
 raath or charkhaari kshetra main uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh kii majboot pakad he
 In the last assembly election, his party's candidate from Rath had drugged Dhruvaram Chaudhary's teeth
 isi se andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki charkhaari main kalyaan singh kaa kya jalawaa rahegaa
 Kalyan Singh announced in Farukhabad on Wednesday that he would hold a public meeting against Uma in Charkhari
 tippaniyan Uma had said in a press conference in Lucknow recently, "I am not an alternative to welfare in BJP
" vah ek bade va mahaan netaa hai or jo mere pita samaan hai
 "kalyan and Uma played the role of leaders in the Ram Mandir movement and since then the two have supported each other in every political fight
 raajnneetik ranneetikaar ranvir singh chouhan kehete hai, "charkhaari main lodhi maton kaa bantwaaraa hoga
 The entire electorate of the election is based on 36 per cent Dalit votes
 kul milakar jahaan uma bharti ko apni birdari ke purv mukhyamantri kalyaan singh kaa virodh jhelana hoga
 At the same time, a lot of effort will have to be made to break the chakravyuh of the local strong leaders of the fraternity and the youth power of Rahul

 unka dil garibon ke liye bhi dhadkta he
 Apart from being a leader, Kapil Sibal, who wrote songs in films, participated in literature till date
 kapil sibbal ne garibon par ek kavita sunai-haq mere dilaa tu,mujhako khuda tu, nahin to bataa tu, karegaa phir kya tu
 Kapil Sibal said that every person should become a human being
 jo insaaniyat ke raste nahin chalegaa hameshaa pareshaan rahegaa
 Life is such a thing that you do not know what is going to happen next
 kapil sibbal ne bataaya ki ham jab siyasat main the to hameshaa apni baat rakhte the
 i have been writing poems before i became a politician
 kapil desh main badlaav kii maang karte hue bhi dikhe
 He said that unless we all understand the feeling of poor mind then things will not change

 Did you have the intoxication of power? We were intoxicated by power, but you also know how drunk we were
 hamen kaam kiya or vahi hamaari pehali jimmedaari thi
 By the way, we have come here to talk about virtues and not politics
 to kya satta ko bhi kya koi shaayar chahie?kavi samaaj main hai or aisa nahin he ki satta ko kavi chahie
 Everyone has a poet in their mind and the poet has no power
 apane likhane ke anubhav ke bare main bhi unhone baatcheet kii
 He said, i used to write before 2014 and i have written two books

 All arrive at the same place later
 chaahe phir aap kitni bhi bhagdaud kar len
 Read these lines of poetry on this very point

 On the statement of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raj and Ramdas Athavalenraj have become famous
 donon netaaon ne kaha he ki mukhyamantri ko bayaan waapas lenaa chahie kyonki isse daliton main naaraazgi badhegi
 Chief Minister Chauhan recently said in a tweet that under the SC-ST Act in Madhya Pradesh, there will be no arrest without investigation
 siem shivaraj ne apane twitor handle se ek twit kiya tha ki madhya pradesh main essi-asti act main bina jaanch ke giraftaar nahin kii jaaegi
 He said that SC / ST Act will not be misused in MP
 chouhan se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki kya rajya sarkaar centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke evaj main koi adhyadesh laaegi, to unhone kaha, "mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 "furthering his point, the Chief Minister said that the interests of all the upper castes, backward classes, scheduled castes, tribes will be protected in the state, whoever will be arrested only after investigation of whatever complaint comes
 kya kahaudit rajanabijapi saansad udit raaj ne kaha ki is maamle main main takalif mahasoos kar rahaa hum ki aisa bayaan kyon diya he
 Our government strengthens the law and our Chief Minister dilutes
 isse badi bechaini mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 Phones are also coming
 samaaj ke andar phir se niraashaa he
 Outrage has arisen, so it should be reconsidered
 udit raaj ne kaha, yah jo hamaara samaaj he, isamen ekta honi chahie
 Which is contradiction must end
 faasla khatm hona chahie
 This will increase casteism
 main baat party main bhi rakhuunga
 i will talk to Mr
 Chauhan
 main rashtriya adhyaksh se bhi baat karuunga
 In the case of SC-ST itself, why such a double character, double standard is being adopted
 shivaraj singh chouhanako kahuunga ki vah is maamle ko waapas len, is bayaan ko waapas len
 What said Athawale, RPI leader and MP Ramdas Athawale has also come down against Nechauhan's statement
 unhone kaha, ho saktaa he shivaraj singh chouhan ne apana bayaan agadi jatiyon ko khush karne ke liye diya ho lekin unhen aisi koi baat nahin bolni chahie jisase dalit samudaay main bhay yaa asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa ho
 Athawale said that Chauhan should withdraw his statement as the Chief Minister is for both forward and backward
 supreme courtne essi-asti act ke maamle main bada faisla sunaaya tha or jaanch ke baad hi prakaran darj karne kii baat kahi thi, magar centre sarkaar ne ek adhyadesh laakar supreme court ke faisle ko badal diya tha
 According to this ordinance, a complaint will be registered without investigation on behalf of a person from SC-ST society and the accused will go to jail for six months
 centre ke is faisle ke khilaaf madhyapradesh main virodh pradarshan kaa daur lagaataar jari he
 Protest in Madhya Pradesh On 3 September, the upper castes of the upper castes in Madhya Pradesh took to the streets against the Dalit law and lodged their protest
 upi ke kai hisson main bhi virodh kii khabaren hai
 a few days ago, in many districts of Bihar, the upper castes openly protested and expressed their displeasure
 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Before that, opposition to the upper castes is considered very important
 yahaan akhil bhartiya brahman mahasabha or kshatriya mahasabha ne bijepi ke khilaaf khulkar virodh shuru kiya
 Since both the Center and Madhya Pradesh have a BJP government, the Mahasabha took a pledge to defeat the BJP, blaming the law on this party
 udhar, akhil bhartiya kshatriya mahasabha sanghathan ke rashtriya adhyaksh amar singh bhadauria ne kaha ki agle vidhansabha chunaav main sanghathan bijepi kaa khulkar virodh karegaa or logon se iske khilaaf vot dene kii apil karegaa
 Bhadauria, while denying the changes brought by the central government in the law, said that it had deeply hurt the interests of the general class
 america raashtrapati donald trump ne kashmir masale par madhyasthata kii apni apil phir se doharaai he
 However, the US said that if both countries say India and Pakistan, then only Trump will try to mediate
 america ne kaha ki ham kashmir masale par baariki se najar rakh rahe hai
 On 26 August Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet
 isse pehle america prashasan ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki kashmir ke halaat par ham baariki se najar rakh rahe hai
 We are also advising both of us to maintain peace and restraint
 is hafte trump or modi kii mulaakaat main kashmir kaa masalaa uth saktaa he
 Explain that there has been tension between India and Pakistan since the repeal of Article 370 of the Constitution giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 raashtrapati donald trump se pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mulaakaat se pehle america ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki trump prashasan kashmir ke halaat par kareeb se najar banaae hue he
 We are appealing for peace
 gauratlab he ki bharat ne antarrashtriya samudaay se spasht rup se kaha he ki jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene vaale samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ko khatm karnaa ek aantarik maamla tha or saath hi pakistan ko vaastaviktaa sweekaar karne kii salaah bhi di
 However, there is no doubt that for the last seven decades, India and Pakistan have come face to face on the Kashmir issue
 hamane baatcheet bhi kii, jangen bhi ladiin, zakhm bhi khaae or zakhm die bhi
 But never accepted the arbitration of any third on the issue of Kashmir
 lekin pakistan ke maujuuda halaat aise hai ki use apni charmarati arthvyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye america kaa saath chahie or america ko duniya ke saamne apni choudharahat dikhaane kaa bahaanaa
 On this pretext, US President Donald Trump jumped into the Kashmir issue
