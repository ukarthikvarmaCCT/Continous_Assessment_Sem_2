 Students' union elections are being held today in the midst of assembly election campaign in Rajasthan
 har saal hone vaale ye chunaav is baar isliye zyaada mahatvapurn hai kyonki teen maheene baad rajya kii satta ke liye vot daale jaaenge
 These college and university elections are also considered a litmus test of state politics
 khasakarrajasthanuniwarsity ko iske sabase bade pratik ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 In such a situation, everyone keeps an eye on the results here
 haalanki, rajya main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar hone ke baavjood pichley chaar chunaavon main akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (ABVP) ko adhyaksh pad par jeet nahin mili he
 That is, since the formation of Vasundhara Raje government in December 2013, the results of the student union elections for the bjp-backed ABVP have been disappointing
 ab jabaki puraa pradesh chunavi mod main he, aise main chaatr sangh ke nattejey bhi chunavi bhaashan kaa hissaa banenge ye mana ja saktaa he
 The last four election results were won by NSUIK Anil Chaupra in 2014
 unhone abivipi ke shankar gaura ko haraaya tha
 Subsequently in 2015 also NSUI won and Satvir Chaudhary defeated Rajkumar Biwal
 2016 main nirdaleey ankit dhayal ne abivipi ke akhilesh pari ko haraaya or 2017 main nirdaleey pawan yadav ne abivipi ke sanjay machedi ko haraaya
 However, it is also a fact that they rebelled against the independent ABVP and went to the students' union elections and they won
 baghawat se ubari ABVPABVP kaa daawa he ki pichley chunaavon main baghawat unke liye nuksaandeh rahi he, lekin maujuuda chunaav main is samasya kaa samaadhaan kar liya gaya he
 ABVP Provincial Organization Minister Arjun Tiwari told Aaj Tak that this time there has not been a revolt in his organization, but the students of NSUI have chosen a different path, which will benefit ABVP
 arjuna tiwadi ne rajasthan uniwarsity ke saath hi aagaamee vidhansabha main bhi bijepi kaa paracham lahraane kaa bharosa jataayaa
 At the same time, NSUI candidate Ranbir Singhania, who accused him of assault, also claimed victory
 bataa den ki voting subah 8 baje shuru hokar dopaher 1 baje tak chalegi
 These are the candidates for the post of President, Rajpal Chaudhary - ABVP Ranbir Singhania - NSUI Vinod Jakhar - Rebel candidate, NSUI Mahesh Samota - Rebel candidate, NSUI Dushyantraj Chundawat - Rebel candidate, NSUI Vinod Kumar Kumawat - Independent candidate cricketer se rajaneta bane imran khan kii party ne ravivaar ko kaha ki isane nato sainikon ke liye padosi desh afghanistan jane vaale raste ko band karne kii yojana sthagit kar di he

 Party president Imran said the protest against the drone attack and the decision to block passage between 20 and 23 November for NATO troops have been canceled in view of Pakistan's fragile security situation
 imran ne kaha, ise radd nahin kiya gaya he lekin hamaare logon kii samvedansheeltaa tathaa desh main suraksha kii najuk sthiti ko dekhte hue sthagit kiya gaya he
 It was one morning in October 1998
 us samay ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne fikki main bhaashan dene se pehle ek bade idia par charchaa ke liye vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ko bulawaaya
 Vajpayee wanted to present a vision in one of the two largest industry organizations in the country that would immediately attract big business leaders
 usee samay unhone deshbhar main rajmargon kaa jaal bichaane kaa vichaar pehali baar rakhaa
 On October 24, 1998, at a FICCI meeting, he announced that the government would start the work of laying 7,000 km of roads from 20 different places across the country in the same year
 us samay puure desh ko rajmargon or sadakon se jodgaye kaa vaajapeyi sarkaar kaa yah prastaav bahut dur kii kaudi lagata tha
 Sinha said that "people made fun of Vajpayee and started asking where would the money come from?" There were also many challenges such as land acquisition
 ’’ is samay 54,000 karod ru
 For the road project underway, the money was initially raised by levying an additional rupee on petrol and diesel
 pandrah saal baad bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar narendra modi ne jab bharat kii nadiyon ko aapas main jodgaye samet kai vichaar rakhe tab bhi logon kii pratikriya lagbhag waisi hi thi
 His concept for India includes plans to connect rivers, run bullet trains, modernize railway systems, build gas grids and optical fiber networks, and build 100 smart cities
 in par 20 lakh karod ru
 Will cost
 nadiyon ko jodgaye kaa vichaar 2002 main vaajapeyi yug main aayaa tha, jisamen uttar bharat kii 14 nadiyon ke alaava himalay se nikalne vaali or dakshin bharat main prayadweep kii 16 nadiyon ko jodgaye kii baat thi
 In 2004, the UPA government, led by the Congress, put it on hold
 pramukh infrastracchar sarvice company feedback inphra ke upaadhyaksh vinayak chatarji kaa kahana he ki aisa hone se baadh or akaal se mukti milegi, nae panbizli ghar lag sakenge or lakhon hectare jameen kii sinchai ho sakegi
 Modi also told at an award ceremony in Delhi on 17 January how the future cities would flourish along with the optic fiber network
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki vigyaan or technology se aadhunik bharat kii buniyaad padegi
 There Shiva Nadar, Kiran Karnik, Vineet Nair & c

 Well-known faces of the IT industry like Gurnani were present
 ek ity company ke varisht adhikari ne apana naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki ve modi yaa unki party ke prashansak nahin hai, phir bhi lagata he ki modi takanic main nai soch kaa mahatv samajhate hai
 This thinking of Modi seems to be similar to the policies started from Vajpayee era
 vaajapeyi ne sadakon, rajmargon or bandargahon ko jodgaye jaise kaamon se raashtra nirmaan kii jo prakriya shuru kii thi, use modi soochna hive ke jariye aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 Suresh Prabhu, who was the Minister of Power in the Vajpayee cabinet, says that "vajpayee was the first Prime Minister who envisioned roads to connect all villages with the country's major markets
" puure desh ke liye yojana banaate samay aapako jamini str kii jaankaree honi chahie or modi ke ghoshit agenda se lagata he ki ve ise lekar gambhir hai
 Modi's supporters say that his vision for India is based on the successes in Gujarat
 gujarat main is samay kareeb 125 smart city pariyojnaayen chal rahi hai
 These smart cities are connected to IT as well as roads and highways
 lekin aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki modi ke iraade bharat kii jamini sachaai se koson dur hai or ye iraade unke apane bhi nahin lagate
 For example, running a bullet train is very expensive and has been under consideration for years
 bharat ke optical fibre network kaa dayera badhaakar do lakh gram panchayaton ko broadband se jodgaye kii yojana pehle se he
 Prominent agrarian economists believe that Modi's proposal to provide immediate current information about farming has passed
 isaki vajah yah he ki bharat main jot choti hone ke kaaran upgrah ke jariye puure desh main paidaavaar kaa hisaab rakh paanaa vyaavhaarik nahin mana jaataa
 But experts also say that infrastructure has been finding a place in the main agenda of politics after a long time
 vinayak chatarji is baat se khush hai ki nadiyon ko jodgaye kii baat to ho rahi he
 The impact of this program may be four times that of the national highways scheme
 centre for policy research main varisht arthshaastri rajeev kumaar maanate hai ki yah sab sunne main bahut acha lagata he, lekin jab tak puraa khaakaa saamne na ho tab tak ye sari chijen kori bayaanbaji hi lagati hai
 Vajpayee had a unique ability to bring everyone together on important decisions
 lekin modi ko apni kalpana saakaar karne ke liye yah kaabiliyat hasil kerani padegi
 It will not be easy

 film kaa naam:bombai velveetdrector:anuraag kashyapstar cast:ranbir kapur, anoushka sharma, karan johar, ke ke menon, vivaan shah, manish choudhary , siddharth basuavadhi:151 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 staffnurag kashyap kaa zikr hote hi agglag film kii soupane aap hi panpane lagati he , chaahe wo blike friday , gulaal , gangs of vasepur ho yaa phir agli , or is baar bhi kuch alag karne kii koshish kii he anuraag ne , itihaaskaar gyaan prakaash kii kitaab 'mumbai febles ' se prerit hokar unhone pichley aath saal se sirf'bombai velvet 'kii likhaawat kii or aakhirkaar darshakon ke saamne aa gayi unki kriti 
 When we do a new experiment, there are only two things, either it succeeds or disappointment strikes
 aaiye jaanate hai anuraag kaa ye prayaas kaisaa he
 Story: - Balraj (ranbir Kapoor) comes to Bombay (now called Mumbai) with his mother in 1949 during the indo-pak partition and there, due to some circumstances, he dreams of becoming rich under poverty and making that dream come true
 Businessman Kaizad Khambata (karan Johar) works as a manager in the 'bombay Velvet' club, and Rosie (anushka Sharma), who works as a jazz singer in the same club Safety sits
 ishk ke saath saath dhandha bhi chalata rahata he phir twist or alag alag kathanak saamne aate hai or tipical anuraag kashyap kii filmon se thodaa alag clymex aata he
 Acting and Music: - In terms of acting, Ranbir Kapoor has revived his character, the way the tone, chalal, hav bhava has been captured by Ranbir is a compliment
 vahiin roji ke kirdaar main jaij singer bani anoushka sharma kaa kaam prashansaneey he lekin karan johar ke kuch aise seen hai jo aapke chehre par muskaan bhi laate hai 
 The character of actor KK Menon could have been made even bigger and better, Anurag has not been able to fully cash him in this film
 vivaan shah bhi kuch frem share karte hai is film main or ek or kirdaar he chimman yani rabar ke dost kaa , jise manish choudhary ne nibhaayaa he, wo kai baar saraahneey sa dikhataa he
 On the other hand, if we talk about the music, then the impression of the 60s Gano is found in this film and according to me i should have reduced 1-2 songs
 jis tarah se gaano ke dauraan 60 ke dashak ke vaadya yantron kaa prayog amit trivedi ne kiya he wo bhi kaaphi saraahneey he
 Why you can see that you have your own reasons for watching this film, for example, you are a fan of Ranbir, Anushka, or Karan Johar, and if you are a fan of Anurag Kashyap and his film, then this film may not fit you And disappointment came along
 kyon naa dekhen-film ko dekhte dekhte kai baar aise khyaal aate hai kii aakhir kab khatm hogi ye film or pataa chalata he kii abhi to interval bhi nahin hua he , anuraag kashyap ne goliyaan, maar dhaad, 60 ke dashak kaa shahar basaaya he or harek choti choti baariki par to dhyaan diya he lekin is baar wo apni kriti se logon kaa manoranjan karne main asamarth se dikhte hai, soch kaaphi acchhee thi kii bombai ko mahanagar kaa darj milane se pehle kaa vakt or log kaise the lekin is baar filmakan kaaphi dhilaa rah gaya
 The manner of telling the story is quite disappointing and the money is not recovered with 151 minutes
 main khud anuraag kii kai filmon se ittefaq rakhata hoon lekin is film kii tulana kaa star kaaphi neeche rah jaataa he haalanki ranbir ne apane sarvocch pradarshan main se ek role is film main nibhaayaa he lekin is film kii patakatha kaa khamiyaja unhen bhi uthaanaa padegaa
 i give 2 stars to this film
 1 star ranbir kapur kii behtareen or umdaa parfarmes ke liye or 1 star anuraag kashyap kii 8 saal kii taiyaari ke liye ,kyonki film banane main kaaphi mehnat lagati he bhale hi wo dishaheen hi kyon naa ho

 ”(input-bhashaa) In Maharashtra, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to form the government
 chunaavon ke baad bijepi sabase badi party ban kar ai thi isi vajah se rajyapal ne sarkaar gathan kii sambhaavnaaen talashne kii koshish kii
 The governor has asked the BJP to explain its stand on forming the government
 iske baad sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki bijepi netaa ravivaar ko rajyapal se mil sakate hai
 Significantly, in the assembly elections, BJP became the largest party by securing 105 seats
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko devendra fadanvis ne rajyapal ko istipha saunp diya tha
 Let us tell you that 15 days have passed since the election results in Maharashtra on October 24, but neither a party nor a coalition of any parties came forward to form the government
 isi vajah se rajyapal ne khud sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko talashne kii koshish kii
 That is why on Saturday, the Governor has asked the state's largest party, BJP, about forming the government
 shuukravaar ko fadanvis ne diya tha istifamaharashtra main chunaav parinaamon ke baad nai sarkaar ke gathan main aayaa gatirodh khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 Finally, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis submitted his resignation to the Governor on Sunday evening
 is ghatnakram ke baad aisa mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi ne sarkaar gathan kii apni yathasambhav koshishen kar lee hai or ab vah anya dalon ke rukh kaa intjaar karnaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena is still firm on its terms
 fadanvis ne shivasena par lagaae kai aarompani press conference ke dauraan fadanvis ne spasht kiya ki mere saamne kabhi bhi uddhav thakare ne dhai-dhai saal ke siem kaa prastaav nahin rakhaa tha
 However, he also said that i do not know if this thing would have happened to Amit Shah
 fadanvis ne aage kaha ki chunaavon ke baad mahayuti kii acchhee siten ai thim 
 We could have sat down and settled the matter but his attitude was not of discussion
 pehle din se hi un logon ne bayaanbaji shuru kar di thi
 Accusing Shiv Sena of 'betrayal' during the press conference, Fadnavis said, "I even went to meet him, made a call but he did not receive a single call
" rigelt aane ke baad congress or ensipi se lagaataar charchaa kii lekin hamase baat bhi nahin kii 
 "at the same time, pointing at the behavior of other Shiv Sena leaders, Fadnavis said," The way people talk around Uddhav Thackeray does not form a government
 baatcheet se vivaad sulajh saktaa tha
 Some people started making rhetoric from the day of the result
 bal thakare hamaare liye sammanit hai isiilie hamane kabhi koi apmanjanak baat nahin kii
 "uddhav Thackeray gave Fadnavis a furious reply
 On behalf of Shiv Sena, senior party leader Sanjay Raut denied all things of Fadnavis
 uske baadashivsena pramukh uddhav thakare bhi media ke saamne aae or ek-ek kar sabhi baton par apana paksh rakhaaor spasht kiya ki bijepi kii ore se jhooth bolaa gaya or main jhuuthon se baat nahin karata
 With this, Uddhav Thackeray once again reiterated that i have pledged to my father that one day i will make Shiv Sainik the CM of Maharashtra and i am still firm on that
 fadanvis ke phone vaali baat kaa jawaab dete hue uddhav ne kaha ki mere paas vakt tha or main baat kar saktaa tha lekin main jhooth bolne waalon se baat nahin karata
 PM Modi calls me younger brother and BJP cheats me
 logon ko amit shah and company par koi bharosa nahin he
 i will not make any further mistake iske saath hi bijepi ko ultimatum dete hue uddhav ne kaha ki bijepi sarkaar banaae nahin to hamaare vikalp khule hai
 Maharashtra needs a government as farmers are troubled by drought and excess rainfall
 sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue uddhav thakare ne kaha ki congress or ensipi se maine abhi tak baat nahin kii he

 At the rally, he had asked people in his familiar style, tell me, did you get hurt by hearing the word Hindu terrorism or not? Three Congress leaders, on target, digvijaypm made the theory of Hindu terror an election issue 15 days ago
 The Hindu terror theory was discussed a lot during the UPA era
 isi theory ko lekar congress ke teen bade netaa pi chidambaram, digvijay singh or susheel scindia frontroot par khel rahe the
 Sanghi, saffron and Hindu terrorism
 aise shabdon ke istemaal par congress or bijepi ke bich badi rajnatik ladaai pehle hi ho chuki he
 In this, the maximum target of BJP was Digvijay Singh, against whom BJP has fielded Sadhvi Pragya Thakur
 aise hi sadhvi ‘dharmayuddh’ nahin kah rahinisi ko vakt kehete hai jo kabhi bhi badal saktaa he
 It was not thought that there would be a chance that the BJP would face the face of Digvijay Singh in the election due to which the theory of Hindu terror came in the discussion
 ye bijepi kii nai chunavi ranneeti he
 Sadhvi Pragya is not calling it a crusade
 digvijay singh ke saamne pragna thakur ko utarkar hindutv vaale chunavi hathiyaar main bijepi ne tej dhar lagaai he
 The BJP has got its chance ever since the NIA court acquitted four accused, including Swami Aseemanand, in the Samjhauta blast case on March 20
 darasal sadhvi ko chunaav maidan main utaarne main sangh or bijepi ko bada mauka dikhaa ki wo hindu aatank kii theory ko janata kii adaalat main lekar jaaen, kyonki upie kii sarkaar par lagaataar aarope ye lage ki hindu aatank kii theory ko jabaran khadaa kiya gaya tha
 bjp's impregnable fort for 30 years Since 1989, in the last thirty years, the BJP has won the Bhopal Lok Sabha seat every time
 pichhali baar 3 lakh 70 hazaar vot ke antar se bijepi ne ye seat jiti thi
 But in the 2018 assembly elections, Congress won 3 out of 8 seats in Bhopal
 paanch siton par bijepi kaa vot share bahut kam hua, jisase bijepi kii chintaa badhi thi
 This time the Congress increased the problems of the BJP by removing Digvijay Singh and forced to change the strategy, because there are about four and a half lakh voters in the 18 lakh voters of Bhopal
 10 saal baad bhi vahi siyaasi sthitivaise hindu aatankwaad ko chunavi mudda pehali baar nahin banaaya gaya he
 Sadhvi Pragya was also in the election center in the 2009 elections
 us samay bhi bijepi ne hindutv kaa card khelaa tha
 The then Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh ke bainks laalkrishna adwani kaa cheharaa aage rakhte hue bijepi ne ‘majaboor pradhanmantri yaa majboot pradhanmantri’ kaa naaraa uchhaala tha
 Not only did the party fail, but Advani's political career also came to an end
 ab 10 saal baad 2019 main bhi sadhvi pragna siyaasi surkhiyon main hai
 The BJP is again in the fray with a card of Hindutva, putting forward the face of a strong Prime Minister as Narendra Modi
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki 10 saal pehle phuss hua ye pataakhaa is baar koi bhuuchaal laa paaegaa yaa nahin

 netritv kii sabase badi chunauti 'dharm sankat' se paar paanaa hota haih pillai'leader kaa atitude pita kii tarah hona chahie, na sukhakaari na hitkari'india today group ke salanaa bijness event mindersh ke 7wein sanskaran ke 'corporate chanakya' satr main management guru doctor radhakrishnan pillai ne bataaya ki chanakya niti kahati he ki ek leader ke paas ek do saal nahin balki 100 saal kaa plan hona chahie
 The success of the leader depends on his strategy
 unke netritv kii sabase badi chunauti tab aati he jab unke saamne 'dharm sankat' aata he or usamen se 'kya karen or kya na karen' main se kisi ek ko chunanaa hota he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan Pillai said that when you are a leader, you are responsible for everything
 leaders ko insaani manovigyaan ko bhi samajhnaa aana chahie
 i see Chanakya as a psychologist who looked into human behavior
 leader ke liye shuruaati 90 din ahmachankya par chanakyaniti naam kii kitaab likhane vaale pillai kehete hai ki yadi aap kisi santhaan main pramot hote hai yaa phir kisi anya duusari sanstha main shaamil hote hai, to shuruaati 90 din behad mahatvapurn hote hai
 But the problem with the leaders is that they become enthusiastic about taking action on the very first day
 unhone kaha ki chanakya kehete hai ki leaders ke saamne sabase badi dikkat us samay hoti he jab unke saamne 'dharm sankat' aan padataa he ki 'kya karen yaa kya na karen'
 In the 7th edition of Mind Rush, Pillai said that Chanakya Niti says that the leader should keep talking to the elders constantly so that he can get to know about past events and their experiences
 usase lagaataar sampark main rahanaa chahie hota he
 Apart from this, attitude is also very important, the leader's attitude should be like a father, neither pleasing nor profitable
 leader kii energy par team kii energy nirbharaunhone kaha ki leader kii energy par hi team kii energy nirbhar karti he
 Most leaders in the world remain calm and work in a peaceful manner
 leader alag-alag tareekon se logon ko protsaahit karte hai
 Dhoni says that do not think big think differently
 chanakya kehete hai ki ranneeti kaam nahin karata he to yah leadership kii samasya he
 a leader should have the ability to assure everyone that everything is stable and there is no problem
 leader khud charge rahe or dusron ko motivet karata rahe
 a leader has to think and get the KRA done
 chanakya kehete hai ki leader ke paas 100 saal kaa plan karnaa chahie
 It all depends on his success planning
 kamyaabi ke liye lagaataar adhyayan sabase bada hathiyaar he kyonki sara gyaan aantarik hota he
 Pillai said that Chanakya's Arthashastra is very simple and is a practical book which talks about material, price, punishment
 chanakya anushaasan kii baat karata he
 It is not that economics came during Chanakya
 chanakya ne khud mana ki unase pehle ke 14 logon ko arthshaastra kii jaankaree thi, wo pehle guru nahin hai jinhen is shaastra ke bare main pataa tha
 The right people get the right job: Chanakya Niti Doctor Radhakrishnan Pillai said that economics talks on leadership
 ek leader kii sabase badi chunauti hoti he ki sahi log ko sahi kaam mili
 He said that Chanakya was not a king, but he had a strategy
 uski ranneeti kargar rahi
 a leader's training is imparted on weekends
 saptang main sapt ang yani saat ang hote hai
 In the 7 thousand sutras of economics, this sutra talks about leadership
 saprung main swami, amatya, janapad, durg, kosh,dand or mitra aate hai or inamen har kisi kii apni mahatta hoti he
 Chanakya's economics also talks about foreign policy
 unhone kaha ki chanakya ke is siddhant total management kahata hum
 Everything has been said in it
 pillai ne kaha ki chanakya kii niti kahati he ki leader ko kabhi bhi akele sangharsh nahin karnaa chahie
 People should fight together by strategizing
 ramayana or mahabharat kii ladaai bhi is kaa bada udhaaharan he
 In this fight, the army's numbers were not important because the strategy worked
 chandragupta ke saath chanakya rahe to arjuna ke saath krishna
 Strategy is important for success

 If the position of the planet Venus in the horoscope is not good, then the thumb of the person gets spoiled without any reason or its form starts deteriorating

 petroleum mantri em virappa moili ne aaj kaha ki sarkaar gas mulya vruddhi ke nirnay ko waapas nahin legi
 Gas producing companies in the country have been allowed to increase from April 1, 2014, which will be double the current price
 moili ne gas mulya badhaane ko lekar apane evam kuch anya ke khilaaf dilli sarkaar ke bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro dwaara darj praathmiki ko ‘asanvaidhanik’ bataate hue dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii tikhi aalochana kii
 The Chief Minister had directed to file this FIR on the complaint of some retired officials in this regard
 moili ne yahaan ek kaarykram ke dauraan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, is par (mulya badhaane ke nirnay par) roak lagane kaa sawaal hi kahaan uthta he
 This (decision to allow gas price increase for both public and private sector producers) has been done through a government process
 is par mantrimandal dwaara do baar vichaar kiya gaya or dobaaraa ise manjuuri di gai he
 The new rates are based on the recommendations of the committee set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Moily's predecessor, S

 Moily said, i do not think the Delhi government is our Appellate Tribunal
 ve jo kuch bhi kar rahe hai vah puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he or nischitator par sangheey dhaanche ke siddhanton ke khilaaf he
 He said that the FIR is "a very clear case that they are exercising their rights beyond the constitution and i would rather say that it is contrary to the statutory provisions"
 moili ne kaha ki oengisi jaisi saarvajanik companiyon va aariel ko antarrashtriya gas bazaaron main maujuuda evam pichley 12 maheene main eendhan aayaat kii laagat ke ausat mulyon ke baraabar keemat vasuulne kii anumati, rangarajan samiti kii siforeeshon par aadhaarit he
 He said, he (rangarajan) is an eminent economist and i gave a single word, full stop in his recommendations
 kuch bhi nahin badla he isliye gas mulya vruddhi par moili kaa faisla kahaan he
 Moily said, the Rangarajan committee was formed by Jaipal Reddy, who was the petroleum minister at the time
 maine apni jaruraton ke mutabik, samiti gathit nahin kii he
 Asked if he would go to the High Court against the FIR, Moily said that it was for the Cabinet and the Prime Minister to decide, as the decision to raise the price of gas was not his personal decision
 unhone kaha, mantrimandal dwaara ise do baar (pehali baar june, 2013 main or phir disambar main) manjuuri di gai
 Earlier at a conference organized by the Indian branch of the United Nations' Global Compact Network, Moily said that energy security for the country cannot be achieved unless competitive prices are given

 Revealing the incident, the Ghaziabad police has recovered the 5-month-old child safely

 Professor Rajeshwar Shastri Musalgaonkar, who predicted the Bharatiya Janata Party to get more than 300 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, has made a new prediction about the Modi government
 ajtak se baatcheet main ujjain ke professor rajeshwar shastri musalgamvakar ne kaha ki aagaamee paanch saal main centre kii modi sarkaar kai nae kirtiman sthapit karegi
 During this time the fear of insecurity in the country will end
 vikram vishvavidhyalay ke professor musalgamvakar ne daawa kiya he ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan desh main shanti bani rahegi or yah sarkaar ab tak sabase vishwasaneey sarkaar sabit hogi
 Let us tell you that during the Lok Sabha elections, Professor Mussalgaonkar had predicted the Bharatiya Janata Party to get more than 300 seats in his Facebook post
 isaki shikaayat congress ne jila nirvachan adhikari or jila shiksha adhikari se kii thi
 The District Education Officer suspended Professor Musalgaonkar, believing it to be a violation of the code of conduct
 haalanki jab loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aae, to professor musalgamvakar kii bhavishyavaanee sahi sabit hui or bijepi ne shandaar jeet hasil kii
 In this election, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 Lok Sabha seats, while the Congress could win only 52 seats
 iske alaava diemke ko 23 siten or trinmul congress ko mahaj 22 loksabhaa siten milin
 After all, who is Professor Musalgaonkar Professor Rajeshwar Shastri Musalgaonkar is a Professor in the Department of Astrology of Vikram University, Ujjain
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan professor ke daawey par bhale hi ungliyaan uthi hon, lekin jab nattejey aae, to professor rajeshwar shastri musalgamvakar kii bhavishyavaanee sach sabit hui
 Now BJP has won with majority and Narendra Modi is going to take oath of Prime Minister for second time on 30th May
 aise main ab yah dekhnaa behad dilachasp hoga ki kya professor kaa nilamban waapas hota he yaa nahin? The Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill 2014 has been passed by the Delhi Cabinet
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twitor par likhaa, 'badhai! dilli jan lokapal bill dilli cabinet dwaara paas
 'congratulations
 Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill passed by Delhi Cabinet— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)february 3, 2014dilli sarkaar dwaara jan lokapal bill ko manjuuri mil gai he
 The Cabinet will introduce this bill directly in the Delhi Assembly, it will not be presented to the Central Government
 jan lokapal bill kaa lambey samay se intjaar tha
 This decision was taken after three cabinet meetings
 kejariwal sarkaar pehle hi bataa chuki he ki vidhansabha kaa satr 13 se 16 farvari tak bulaayaa jayega
 Although Delhi does not have full state status, it is against the constitution to bypass the central government and submit a bill directly to the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 is bare main samvidhan visheshgy subhash kashyap ne kaha ki dilli ke maamle main centre kaa kanoon hi sarvopari he
 If a law is passed by both the Center and the Legislative Assembly, then the law of the Center is valid
 chunki centre sarkaar janalokapal bill paas kar chuki he, to dilli ke apane lokapal kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Yes, the Legislative Assembly can amend the Lokayukta Act itself
 kashyap ne bataaya ki samvidhan ke anusaar dilli kaa prashasan raashtrapati ke haath main hota he or unheen ke adheen leftinent governor dilli ke prashaasak hote hai
 Accordingly, the bill should first go to the Lieutenant Governor
 up rajyapal aamtaur par bill ko raashtrapati yani grih mantralay ke paas bhejte hai, jahaan se paas hone ke baad ise rajya main paas kiya jaataa he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Minister Manish Sisodia said, 'today is a historic day for Delhi
 iske bill ke tahat dilli main mukhyamantri se lekar chaparasi tak sabhi log iske daayre main aaenge
 If anyone's name comes in corruption, there will be a similar investigation against him
 'kejariwal sarkaar ne badi sidhi-si lakeer khinchi he ki koi bhi ab bhrashtachar ke aaropon se pare nahin hoga or jaise esadm kii jaanch hogi vaise hi mukhyamantri kii jaanch hogi
 On the basis of the charges, the investigation will be completed in a maximum of 6 months and if found guilty by the Lokpal court, the punishment from 6 months to life imprisonment
 lekin kejariwal sarkaar ke is jan lokapal bill 2014 par bavaal much gaya he
 There is no denying that this law will help in making Delhi a corruption-free city, but the intentions of getting it stuck by clarifying the constitution and traditions are already clear
 dilli jan lokapal adhinium to yahaan tak kahata he ki jo mahakme dilli sarkaar ke daayre se baahar hai, lekin dilli kii janata kaa jinase tallaku he- jaise emsidi, jaise dilli police jaise endiemasi, unke afasaron kii jaanch bhi jan lokapal kar sakegaa
 Even if his report is heard by the general courts
 to kya shaskaon ko apane visheshadhikaron ke khatm ho jane kii chintaa khaae ja rahi he
 Because after the Delhi Jan Lokpal is passed, having a minister, chief minister or IAS, IPS will not be a shield in case of dishonesty
 yahaan tak ki khud jan lokapal bhi shikayaton se upar nahin honge
 Is this a dangerous and illegal initiative in itself? It is understandable that no one should consider themselves above the law or punishment, any corruption can be investigated and any charges should be heard and decided quickly
 What should be the problem? You decide whose concerns are in the dock and whose character? ranvir singh auradipika padukonki shaadi bollywood kii is saal hui sabase charchit shaadi bataai ja rahi he

 Indian batsmen have succumbed to the pressure of big scores
 duusari pari main bharat kaa score 4 wicket ke nuksaan par 112 ran hai or vah england se 333 ran peeche he
 Due to the irresponsible performance of the batsmen, India have come to the verge of an embarrassing defeat in the third cricket Test against England when they lost four wickets for only 112 runs in response to the target of 445 runs
 chauthe din kaa khel samaapt hone par ajinkya rahane 18 or rohit sharma chah ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 India have to make 333 runs on the last day with only six wickets left
 murali vijay (12), shikhar dhawan (37) cheteshwar pujaara (2) or viraat kohli (28) pavilion laut chuke hai
 India were trailed by 269 runs after being dismissed for 330 in the first innings, but England captain Alastair Cook decided to bat again instead of giving the follow-on to rest his bowlers
 bharat ne 445 ran ke mushkil lakshya k jawaab main duusari pari kii kharaab shuruuaat kii
 Victory run out on the throw of Stuart Broad
 pujaara kaa kharaab form jari rahaa jo spinner moin ali kii gend par pehali slip main kris jordan ko kaich de baithe
 Kohli and Dhawan added 51 runs for the third wicket but Dhawan was caught by Jordan in a slip off Joe Root on a superb off break ball
 vahiin ali ne viraat kohli ko bold kiya
 Earlier, England declared the second innings at 205 for four
 pari ghoshit karne ke samay captain elestare cook 70 ran banaakar khel rahe the jo match main unka doosraa ardhashatak he
 Cook scored this with the help of 114 balls with seven fours

 Jadeja took three wickets for 52 runs
 isse pehle bhartiya team tisare din ke apane score aath wicket par 323 ran main sirf saat ran kaa ijapha karke out ho gai
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (50) could not add a single run to yesterday's score
 james anderson ne 53 ran dekar paanch wicket liye or test cricket main ek pari ke paanch wicket lene kaa kamaal unhone 16veen baar kiya
 Cook decided not to follow India
 cook or sam rabasan (13) ne england kii pari ko dhire-dhire aage badhaayaa
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar broke the partnership in the seventh over of the innings by edging Robson to Shikhar Dhawan in the first slip
 pehali pari ke shatakaveer gairi balance 38 ran banaakar out hue
 He was unfortunate that umpire Marais Erasmus called him out at short leg off Jadeja
 lunch ke baad cook or ian bel (23) ne teji se ran banane shuru diye
 He was successful in this as it seemed that the Indian team was waiting for the announcement of the innings
 isse ballebaajon ko aasaani se ran banane kaa mauka mila
 Jadeja dismissed Bell in the 27th over
 root ne iske baad aakraamak khel dikhaate hue 38 gend main aath chaukon kii madad se 50 ran banaaye

 New Delhi: In the last decade, a new generation of Hindi readers has been created
 jo na keval nae lekhakon or nae tarah ke content kii ummid se sarabor he, balki use apni bhashaa kii viraasat kii bhi chintaa he
 It has also had a positive impact on the Hindi publishing industry
 kisi bhi jimmedaar or doordarshee prakaashak ko jab pathakon kaa bahut majboot saath miltaa he to use nai se nai yojanaon ko saakaar karne, viraasat ko nai pahunch dene kaa kadam uthaane main sankoch nahin hota
 This is a major event in the history of Hindi publishing, when four reputable publications have merged into Rajkamal Publishing Group, on their way to reaching the state of history
 sahitya bhawan privet limited (sthapana varsh: 1917), purvoday prakaashan (sthapana varsh : 1951), saransh prakaashan (sthapana varsh: 1994), remadhav prakaashan (sthapana varsh: 2005) isamen shaamil hai
 These four publications have been very special for Hindi in terms of their authors and the works published from here
 ab ye raajakmal prakaashan samooh ke ang ho gaye hai
 Speaking about the merger, Ashok Maheshwari, Chairman and Managing Director of Rajkamal Publication Group, said that since i took up my senses, Hindi publishers were able to talk to each other about bulk purchases
 thok kharid yani sarkari nirbharta
 Everyone would fight for this and for this reason they would be friends
 tabhi se sochataa rahata ki isse mukti kaise mil sakati he! mujhe lagata rahaa he ki acchhee, pathak priy pustaken zyada se zyada hon, ek saath hon, tabhi shaayad isse mukti sambhav ho sakati he
 Collecting thousands of books that have been written by the best Indian manisha, who have been dear to the readers, which have a stream of Indian tradition and contemplation, go to the trough of the past, gather a chance to get back to the market better, We have a big step towards being self-reliant and reader-dependent
 102 varsh puraane ‘sahitya bhawan’ kii sthapana mahaan hindi sevi rajarshi purushottams tandon ji kii aguai main hui thi
 Initially, the organization faced financial hardship due to its non-commercial approach

 Talking about the merger, his great-grandson and current director of Sahitya Bhavan, Alankar Tandon said that, more than a thousand rare books have been published from Sahitya Bhavan in almost all literary genres
 raajakmal prakaashan samooh agrani prakaashan santhaan he
 In such a group Sahitya Bhavan Pvt
 li
 Involvement is an important phenomenon not only for the publishing industry, but also from the literary point of view
 ham prasann hai or samooh ke ujjwal bhavishya kii kaamana karte hai
 Poorvodaya Prakashan was founded by the well-known Hindi writer Janendra unke suputr pradeep kumaar kaa kahana he, hamaare liye yah bahut sammaan kii baat he ki purvoday prakaashan kii viraasat ab raajakmal prakaashan samooh ke pratishthit haathon main he
 Poorvodaya Prakashan has provided quality and quality literature to readers for many decades
 ummid he ki raajakmal prakaashan samooh main purvoday prakaashan kaa shaamil hona hindi bhashaa or sahitya kii samrudh saanskrithik viraasat ko or aage badhaayegaa
 Remadhav publication started with the passion and enthusiasm of three friends, Atul Garg, Ashok Bhowmik and Madhav Bhan
 inhone shuruyaat bangla ke murdhanya lekhak sathyajith re, shankar, shripanth, sunil gangopadhyaay kii kitabon ke hindi anuwaad se kii
 With attractive covers and good production, they became well recognized from the beginning
 remadhav ke sah-sansthaapak madhav bhaan kaa kahana he, 'remadhav publications kaa raajakmal prakaashan santhaan ke saath judana hamaare liye gaurav kii baat he
 i am glad that Remadhav's books will be published by Rajkamal Prakashan, with superb production as per their tradition
 saransh prakaashan ke sansthaapak mohan gupt ne hinditar bhartiya bhashaaon ke sahitya or vishwa sahitya kii chuninda kritiyon ke anuwaad saath hi saamaajik-aarthik or raajnneetik vishyon par vaicharik pustakon ke prakaashan ke dhyey ke saath jab apana kaam shuru kiya tab unki umr 60 ke padaav par thi
 Very soon he published many important books of big authors with high quality
 unka kahana he ki saransh ek sapane kii falshruti thi
 i was concerned about protecting its quality
 kisi ke aarthik hiton ke liye main iske naam kaa durupyog nahin hone dena chahta tha
 But after observing Ashok Maheshwari's style of functioning and his behavior for a long time, he was confident that he was able to not only preserve, but also carry forward the tradition of this glorious institution
 ab saransh unka he or main aashwast hoon ki ve mere is sapane kii mahaneeyata ko bhi surakshit rakhenge
 It may be noted that Rajkamal Prakashan was established in 1947
 is varsh 28 farvari ko vah apana 70waan prakaashan diwas ‘bhavishya ke swar: vichaar parv’ ke rup main manaa rahaa he
 Rajkamal has more than 7000 books published in 21 genres of more than 45 subjects
 25 se adhik bhartiya or bharatietar bhashaaon ke shreshth sahitya kaa hindi main anuwaad prakashit kar chuke is prakaashan ke kai kitaaben paanch-paanch lakh pratiyon se zyada bik chuki hai
 Standing on the strong foundation laid by visionary founders like Omprakash ji, this publication became a publishing group in 1995 when Radhakrishna Publications and Lokbharati Publications merged with it
 raajakmal prakaashan samooh ke sampadakeey nideshak satyanand nirupam ne is vilay ko hindi or kai bhartiya bhashaaon kii anek durlabh anudit kritiyon ko sangrakshit karne or bhavi peedi ko saunpane vaala kadam bataaya
 He said that the real strength of this big step of Rajkamal is its readers
 unke bharose ke bal par na keval nae tarah ke content ke prayogdharmi prakaashan ham lagaataar kar rahe hai, balki ateet kii dastaveji kitabon ko sahejane-punarprakashit karne kaa kaam bhi aage badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 This series of bringing the diversity of Hindi writing in the best way will go further
 yah hindi prakaashan kaa ek nayaa or behatar daur he
 Amod Maheshwari, CEO of Rajkamal Publishing Group, says the merger of the prestigious four publications into Rajkamal Publishing Group reflects Rajkamal's commitment and passion to reach readers
 hindi prakaashan jagat main in chaaron prakashnon kii ek vishesh pahchaan rahi he
 Rajkamal Publication Group has been involved in the work of bringing the books published from these publications to the maximum readership
 raajakmal prakaashan samooh ke marketing diarector alind maheshwari ne kaha ki kitabon ko aakarshak andaaj, rup, evam bhinn plateform par pathakon tak pahunchaane ke liye raajakmal prakaashan hameshaa se janaa jaataa he
 He said, 'pathak's interest and his choice are omnipresent for us

 We are trying to make books of all four publications available for readers not only in print but also on digital platforms
 " The order of the arguments on the appeals of both sides in the Ram Janmabhoomi case in Ayodhya ended on 17 October
 iske baad vaikalpik raahat (molding of relif) kii maang bhi hindu or muslim pakshon ne ek ke baad ek daakhil kar di
 Molding of relief is a process whereby parties seek alternative relief in the event that their original demand is not met
 muslim paksh ne vaikalpik raahat kii maang silband lipaphe main daakhil kii jis par hindu paksh ne aapatti jaahir kii
 But the court has taken this demand on record
 vaikalpik raahat ke masale par ek kadam aage badhate hue ramalala kii taraf se supreme court se visheshadhikaron kaa istemaal karte hue puri jameen khud ko dene kii maang kii gai he
 It has been said that no part should be given to the Nirmohi Akhara or the Muslim side bypassing the decision of the High Court
 ees kii report se sabit he ki yahaan mandir hua karata tha
 Therefore, the entire land should be given to the Hindu side
 lekin muslim paksh kii maang vishay se kuch hatakar he
 This is a civil case and hindu-muslim parties are in the court regarding the ownership of the land
 muslim paksh ne supreme court se maang kii he ki faisla aisa aae jisamen sanvaidhanik mulya parilakshith hon
 Because this matter will affect the future generations of the country
 sunni vakf board kii taraf se daakhil is apil main kaha gaya he ki court deshhit main faisla de
 The Supreme Court is the keeper of the constitution and its decision should reflect a multicultural and multi-religious culture
 bhavishya kii peediyaan is faisle ko kaise dekhengi, iskaa bhi dhyaan faisle main rakhaa janaa chahie
 Court decisions are based on facts, not feelings
 supreme court samvidhan kaa rakhwala he
 This may have been a motive of the Muslim side to remind the court, which is not clear in this case
 mukhya maang uski bhi jameen par kabje kii he lekin molding of relif main muslim paksh ek bhavuk apil kar rahaa he jo ki apane aap main amoort kism kii he
 This case is not going on in a small court but in the Constitution Bench and five judges in the bench including the Chief Justice have heard it for a quarter of a month
 samvidhan peeth ko faisla dete vakt samvidhan ke mulyon kaa upadesh dena kitni yuktisangat baat he ye to faisla aane par hi pataa chalegaa
 But this much is certain that the Muslim side has made an emotional appeal with the facts
 adaalat ke faisle tathyon or gavaahon par aadhaarit hote hai
 There is no direct witness in this case
 tathyon ke naam par aitihaasik or puranic sakshya hai
 There are reports of the Archaeological Survey of India which can be said to be an important evidence in the case
 hoicourt ne apane faisle main vivaadit jameen ko teen bhaagon main baanta tha jiske khilaaf supreme court main apil hui or hindu-muslim paksh ne puri jameen kaa malikana haq maanga he

 unhone kaha ki ramadayal ne bachche ko padhaane likhaane or videsh bhejne kaa vaada kiya he
 The couple also has an eight-year-old son

 soochna dete the
 When the public was surrounded by problems of exchange of notes, they used to bring new ideas
 us vakt bainkon ke baahar lambii kataron se janata pareshaan thi, haahaakaar machaa hua tha magar shaktikant das press ke saamne aae or bataane lage ki unhen report mili he ki kaala dhan badalane ke liye kuch log baar-baar linon main lag rahe hai, isliye kataren lambii hoti ja rahi hai
 His statement is that the reason for the long queues in banks and atms was that the same people are going to different places again and again
 isliye tab yah idia lekar aae ki cash counter par note badalane vaale logon kii ungali par chunaav ke samay istemaal hone vaali syaahi lagaai jaaegi
 The decision was severely criticized
 tab chunaav ayog ne vitt mantralay ko likh diya ki na mitane vaali syaahi ke istemaal se paanch rajyon main hone vaale matdaan kii prakriya par asar nahin padana chahie
 The announcement was made but when the ink did not reach the banks, banks started using the marker
 is faisle kaa majaak udne laga
 Shaktikanta Das has now become the Governor of the Reserve Bank
 jab notebandi ke samay poocha jaataa tha ki bhartiya reserve bank ke governor notebandi par kyon nahin bol rahe hai tab shaktikant das ne kaha tha ki koun bol rahaa he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 i am speaking on behalf of the government
 isliye iskaa koi matlab nahin he ki main bol rahaa hum yaa koi or bol rahaa he
 Shaktikanta Das is a 1980 batch IAS officer
 itihaas vishay ke hai magar lambey samay tak aarthik maamalon se sambandhit vibhaagon main kaam kiya he
 Also did a management course from IIM
 pi chidambaram, pranab mukherjee or arun jetali ke saath vitt mantralay main kaam kar chuke hai

 In response, departments related to their economic affairs are being introduced
 ve 28 saal main pehle aise governor hai jo arthshaastri nahin hai
 s Venkitaraman became the governor before him
 arabiai ke governor banane kii yah koi shart nahin he ki arthshaastri hi hoga
 Former governor d Subbarao has said that even a phd without economics can be a governor
 governor aisa vyakti hona chahie jis par bazaar bharosa kare
 Amit Ranjan Mishra has written that Das was a contender even after Rajan's departure
 ritair hone ke baad jab unke secority and exange board sebi ke chif banane kii charchaa ho rahi thi tab bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ne hangaamaa kar diya tha
 Wrote a letter to the Prime Minister that he was close to Chidambaram and indulged in corruption
 iske baad kaha jaataa he ki unhen sebi kaa mukhiya nahin banaaya gaya tha
 Subramanian Swamy has also given a statement today
 vaise pi chibandaram ne bhi shaktikant das ko governor banaae jane kii aalochana kii he
 It is said that Shaktikanta Das will follow the direction of the government
 ek arthshaastri kii jagah notebandi kaa samarthan karne vaale naukarshah ko chunane se is sanstha kii garima ko or thes pahonchegi
 The slaves who supported the ban on demonetisation are the other who have been elevated to the top post
 shaayad unka ishaara krishnamurthi subramanyam ko aarthik salaahkaar banaae jane ko lekar he
 Krishnamurthy Subramaniam also described demonetisation as beneficial
 chidambaram ne sawaal kiya he ki kya sarkaar logon ko yah sandesh dena chaahati he ki aap kya sochate hai, hamen parvaah nahin
 We will do what we like
 udhar, zyaadaatar maamalon main sarkaar ke har faisle kii tarif karne vaali do sansthaaen siaiai or fikki ne shaktikant das ko governor banaae jane kaa swaagat kiya he
 The chairman of FICCI has said that Shaktikanta Das has a 360 degree understanding of financial matters
 siii ke adhyaksh rakesh bharti mittal ne kaha he ki anbhavi aarthik export ko governor banaakar sarkaar ne sthiti ko sambhala he or niveshkon or industry main bahut zyaada bharosa paidaa kiya he
 We are confident that the flow of money to lend to banks and non-banking financial institutions will increase
 das tatkaal is samasya par dhyaan denge
 Was Urjit Patel not increasing the flow of money to the banks, did it mean that it was understood that the government wants the Reserve Bank to lend money to the banks from its reserves
 kya shaktikant das un baton par dastakhat karte chalenge jinke virodh main urjit patel ne istipha diya he
 The npas of banks are increasing at the moment
 kaha ja rahaa he ki lone lekar nahin chukaa paane vaali kai companiyaan diwalia hone ke kagaar par hai, ye udyogpati apni companiyon ko bachaa lenaa chaahate hai
 Want to get more loan from banks so that new bookkeeping can be started after paying old accounts
 motaa-moti yahi baat he
 Speaking to the media, Governor Shaktikanta Das made it clear that the government runs the economy
 das ne kaha he ki ve banking sector ke kaaryakari adhikariyon se milenge
 Will talk to them nijee bankeron se bhi milenge
 Sunil Jain of Financial Express tweeted that Shaktikanth will do what he wanted from Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Secretary Urjit Patel? Will the PSA rules be relaxed, will take a soft approach on npas, hand over RBI reserves to the government, give more loans to small scale industries, give more powers to government directors on the board or go on their way? pisie ko samajhnaa hoga
 This is a prompt corrective action
 bhartiya reserve bank ne pisie ke niyam banaae hai
 The government is said to have been unaware but Mint had published a report and claimed that both sides knew
 pisie ke tahat hota yah he ki bhartiya reserve bank un bainkon ko apni nigaraanee main le letaa he jinka enpie ek anupaat se bahut zyaada ho jaataa he
 Under his supervision, he tells the banks not to open a new branch, do not give dividends, save every penny and recover the loan given
 nayaa lone nahin den
 Avoid lending in certain sectors
 bainkon se kaha jaataa he ki agar unke lone kii kisht 180 dinon main nahin aati he to us lone ko enpie ghoshit kar den
 Declaring an NPA will mean that the company will not get a loan for further
 bank bhi lone nahin de sakegaa
 The bank has to recover the money
 is vakt 11 bank pisie ke tahat hai
 The controversy is that the Reserve Bank of India should free these 11 banks from the strict PCA rules so that loans can be distributed
 ashanka yah he ki lone bantane lage to phir se enpie badhegaa
 Loan to MSME has reduced during the Modi government
 2013-14 main jidipi kaa 4
 Was 2 percent
 2017-18 main 2
 8 percent
 bank NBFC ko lone dene lage jiske jariye laghu udyogon ko lone diya jane lage
 Banks have stopped lending to nbfcs ever since the IL&FS dispute broke out
 isse chote bijness ko lone nahin mil rahaa he
 At that time the public was troubled by the long queues outside the banks, there was chaos, but Shaktikanta Das came to the press and told that he has received reports that some people are repeatedly in lines to change black money, so queues Are getting longer
 baqayda unka bayaan he ki bainkon or atm main lambii kataron kaa kaaran yahi tha ki ek hi log alag-alag jagahon par baar-baar ja rahe hai
 Therefore, then he brought the idea that the ink used to be used at the time of elections will be put on the finger of the people who change the notes on the cash counter
 is faisle kii kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 Then the Election Commission wrote to the Finance Ministry that the use of non-dissolving ink should not affect the voting process in five states
 elaan ho gaya magar bainkon ke paas syaahi nahin pahunchi to bank marker kaa istamaal karne lage
 This decision started making fun of him
 shaktikant das ab reserve bank ke governor ban gaye hai
 When asked at the time of demonetisation why the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India is not speaking on demonetisation, Shaktikanta Das said that who is speaking is not important
 main sarkaar kii taraf se bol rahaa hum
 So it does not mean that i am speaking or someone else is speaking
 shaktikant das 1980 batch ke iees afasar hai
 History is subject but has worked in departments related to economic affairs for a long time
 im se bhi management kaa course kiya he
 He has worked in the finance ministry with p Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee and Arun Jaitley
 im bengalooru se financial management se course kiya he
 Shaktikanta Das, a BA and MA from history, is being told about how he will handle the work related to monetary policy
 jawaab main unke aarthik maamalon se sambandhit vibhaagon ko pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He is the first governor in 28 years who is not an economist
 unase pehle es venkitaraman governor bane the
 There is no condition that it will be economist to become Governor of RBI
 purv governor di subbarao ne kaha he ki arthshaastra main bina piechdi vaala bhi governor ho saktaa he
 The governor should be someone whom the market trusts
 amit ranjan mishra ne likhaa he ki das rajan ke jane ke baad bhi daavedaar the
 After his retirement, when there was talk of making the Securities and Exchange Board of Sebi chief, there was an uproar by bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy
 pradhanmantri ko patr likh diya tha ki ve chidambaram ke kareebi rahe hai or bhrashtachar main lipt rahe hai
 It is said that he was not made the head of SEBI
 subramanyam swami ne aaj bhi bayaan diya he
 However, P
 Chibandaram has also criticized the appointment of Shaktikanta Das as the Governor
 kaha he ki shaktikant das sarkaar ke ishaare par chalenge
 Choosing a bureaucrat who supports demonetization over an economist would hurt the dignity of this institution
 notebandi kaa samarthan karne vaale das duusare vyakti hai jinhen chotii ke pad par baithaaya gaya he
 Perhaps his reference is to make Krishnamurthy Subramanian an economic advisor
 krishnamurthi subramanyam ne bhi notebandi ko phydemand bataaya tha
 Chidambaram has questioned whether the government wants to send a message to the people that what we think, we do not care
 ham vahi karenge jo hamen pasand he
 On the other hand, CII and FICCI have welcomed the appointment of Shaktikanta Das as the Governor in most cases, which has praised every decision of the government
 fikki ke adhyaksh ne kaha he ki shaktikant das vittiya maamalon kii 360 degree samaj rakhte hai
 CIE President Rakesh Bharti Mittal has said that the government has handled the situation by making experienced economic experts as governors and has created a lot of trust in investors and industry
 hamen bharosa he ki bainkon or gaiyr banking vittiya sansthaaon ke paas karz dene ke liye paise kaa pravaah badhegaa
 Das will immediately address this problem
 kya urjit patel bainkon ke liye paise kaa pravaah nahin badha rahe the, kya iskaa yahi matlab hua jo samajha ja rahaa tha ki sarkaar chaahati he ki reserve bank apane reserve khazaane se bainkon ke liye paisa de
 Will Shaktikanta Das sign the things against which Urjit Patel has resigned
 is vakt bainkon kaa enpie badhata ja rahaa he
 It is being said that many companies which cannot repay the loan are on the verge of bankruptcy, these industrialists want to save their companies
 chaahate hai ki bainkon se or karz mil jaae taaki purana hisaab chukaakar nayaa bahikhaata chaalu ho jaae
 This is the case
 governor shaktikant das ne media se baat karte hue saaf kar diya ki sarkaar hi arthvyavastha chalaati he
 Das has said that he will meet the executive officers of the banking sector
 unase baat karenge
 Will also meet private bankers
 financial express ke sunil jain ne twit kiya he ki kya shaktikant chupchaap vahi karenge jo vitt mantralay or aarthik maamalon ke sachiv urjit patel se chaahate the? piese ke niyamon main dheel denge, enpie par naram rukh apanaayenge, arabiai kaa reserve sarkaar ko saunp denge, laghu udyogon ko zyaada karz denge, board main sarkari nideshkon ko or adhikaar denge yaa apni raah par chalenge?tippaniyan PCA has to be understood
 ise pramt karactive ection hota he
 The Reserve Bank of India has framed the PCA rules
 kaha jaataa he ki sarkaar ko pataa nahin tha magar mint ne ek report chhaapi thi or daawa kiya tha ki donon pakshon ko pataa tha
 What happens under the PCA is that the Reserve Bank of India takes into account the banks whose npas exceed a ratio
 apni nigaraanee main lekar bainkon se kahata he ki ve nai branch na kholen, dividend na den, ek-ek paisa bachaaen or jo lone diya he use vasulein
 Do not give a new loan kuch khaas sector main lone dene se bachein
 Banks are asked to declare that loan as NPA if their loan installment does not come within 180 days
 enpie ghoshit karne se yah hoga ki us company ko aage ke liye lone nahin milegaa
 Even the bank will not be able to give loan
 bank ko paisa vasuul karnaa he
 At present, 11 banks are under PCA
 vivaad yahi he ki bhartiya reserve bank in 11 bainkon ko pisie niyamon kii kadai se mukt kare taaki lone bant sake
 It is feared that the NPA will increase again if the loans are distributed
 modi sarkaar ke samay MSME ko lone kam ho gaya he
 4 of GDP in 2013-14
 2 pratishat tha
 2 in 2017-18
 8 pratishat ho gaya
 Banks started giving loans to nbfcs through which loans were given to small scale industries
 jab se IL&FS kaa vivaad saamne aayaa he bainkon ne NBFC ko lone dena band kar diya he
 Due to this, small businesses are not getting loans

 chaahate hai ki bainkon se or karz mil jaae taaki purana hisaab chukaakar nayaa bahikhaata chaalu ho jaae
 This is the case
 governor shaktikant das ne media se baat karte hue saaf kar diya ki sarkaar hi arthvyavastha chalaati he
 Das has said that he will meet the executive officers of the banking sector
 unase baat karenge
 Will also meet private bankers
 financial express ke sunil jain ne twit kiya he ki kya shaktikant chupchaap vahi karenge jo vitt mantralay or aarthik maamalon ke sachiv urjit patel se chaahate the? piese ke niyamon main dheel denge, enpie par naram rukh apanaayenge, arabiai kaa reserve sarkaar ko saunp denge, laghu udyogon ko zyaada karz denge, board main sarkari nideshkon ko or adhikaar denge yaa apni raah par chalenge?tippaniyan PCA has to be understood
 ise pramt karactive ection hota he
 The Reserve Bank of India has framed the PCA rules
 kaha jaataa he ki sarkaar ko pataa nahin tha magar mint ne ek report chhaapi thi or daawa kiya tha ki donon pakshon ko pataa tha
 What happens under the PCA is that the Reserve Bank of India takes into account the banks whose npas exceed a ratio
 apni nigaraanee main lekar bainkon se kahata he ki ve nai branch na kholen, dividend na den, ek-ek paisa bachaaen or jo lone diya he use vasulein
 Do not give a new loan kuch khaas sector main lone dene se bachein
 Banks are asked to declare that loan as NPA if their loan installment does not come within 180 days
 enpie ghoshit karne se yah hoga ki us company ko aage ke liye lone nahin milegaa
 Even the bank will not be able to give loan
 bank ko paisa vasuul karnaa he
 At present, 11 banks are under PCA
 vivaad yahi he ki bhartiya reserve bank in 11 bainkon ko pisie niyamon kii kadai se mukt kare taaki lone bant sake
 It is feared that the NPA will increase again if the loans are distributed
 modi sarkaar ke samay MSME ko lone kam ho gaya he
 4 of GDP in 2013-14
 2 pratishat tha
 2 in 2017-18
 8 pratishat ho gaya
 Banks started giving loans to nbfcs through which loans were given to small scale industries
 jab se IL&FS kaa vivaad saamne aayaa he bainkon ne NBFC ko lone dena band kar diya he
 Due to this, small businesses are not getting loans
 das ne kaha he ki ve banking sector ke kaaryakari adhikariyon se milenge
 Will talk to them nijee bankeron se bhi milenge
 Sunil Jain of Financial Express tweeted that Shaktikanth will do what he wanted from Finance Ministry and Economic Affairs Secretary Urjit Patel? Will the PSA rules be relaxed, will take a soft approach on npas, hand over RBI reserves to the government, give more loans to small scale industries, give more powers to government directors on the board or go on their way? pisie ko samajhnaa hoga
 This is a prompt corrective action
 bhartiya reserve bank ne pisie ke niyam banaae hai
 The government is said to have been unaware but Mint had published a report and claimed that both sides knew
 pisie ke tahat hota yah he ki bhartiya reserve bank un bainkon ko apni nigaraanee main le letaa he jinka enpie ek anupaat se bahut zyaada ho jaataa he
 Under his supervision, he tells the banks not to open a new branch, do not give dividends, save every penny and recover the loan given
 nayaa lone nahin den
 Avoid lending in certain sectors
 bainkon se kaha jaataa he ki agar unke lone kii kisht 180 dinon main nahin aati he to us lone ko enpie ghoshit kar den
 Declaring an NPA will mean that the company will not get a loan for further
 bank bhi lone nahin de sakegaa
 The bank has to recover the money
 is vakt 11 bank pisie ke tahat hai
 The controversy is that the Reserve Bank of India should free these 11 banks from the strict PCA rules so that loans can be distributed
 ashanka yah he ki lone bantane lage to phir se enpie badhegaa
 Loan to MSME has reduced during the Modi government
 2013-14 main jidipi kaa 4
 Was 2 percent
 2017-18 main 2
 8 percent
 bank NBFC ko lone dene lage jiske jariye laghu udyogon ko lone diya jane lage
 Banks have stopped lending to nbfcs ever since the IL&FS dispute broke out
 isse chote bijness ko lone nahin mil rahaa he

 The key positions of the Yukans across the country have been taken over by family members or their loyalists of senior Congress leaders

 In an interview with India Today, Satava, however, insisted that the Yukas draw 95 per cent of their cadre from non-political families

 The results of Tamil Nadu and earlier Bihar assembly elections showed that in reality, not much has changed
 in donon rajyon main rahul gandhi ne kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 However his member number 12 in Tamil Nadu due to Rahul's recruitment drive

 vahaan congress ne 63 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 This means that 12 of the Yukans

 Of course Rahul is being discussed all around, but the Congress machinery has failed to expand its base due to the eagerness of the younger generation

 India claims that it has been attacked by cross-border infiltration, while Pakistan is saying that infiltration is not possible given the security of the border
 bharat ne ek hamalavar ke diene ke namoonay die hai, lekin pakistan kahata he ki iskaa milan kisase karen - yahi baat awaz ke namoonon ke bare main kahi ja rahi he - bharat kah rahaa he - pakistan aatankiyon tak pahunche, jabaki pakistan kaa kahana he ki saazish uske yahaan nahin hui
 Apparently, the issue of allowing the Pakistani JIT to come to India has been clouded by questions
 isko lekar sarkaar safaai de rahi he to vipaksh hamale kar rahaa he
 Senior Minister of Government Venkaiah Naidu says, "pakistan has to clear what its stand on terrorism can never say yes or never

 By coincidence, Pakistan claimed to have captured an Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav at the time Pakistan JIT was visiting India
 jaahir he, bharat-pakistan ke bich bharose kii kami saafe dikh rahi he
 This deficiency was also noticed during the investigation of JIT
 enie kaa kahana he ki bharat ne pakistan ko puure saboot die
 Masood also gave the names of Rauf Kashif and Latif Sharif, offering that the investigation team should see the bodies of the slain terrorists, but the Pakistani team refused
 tippaniyan Now India is talking about taking help from the world's best test labs to give a more robust look to its investigation
 ye saaf he ki ye rassakashi der tak chalati rahegi
 On the other hand, India is aware that Pakistan will not give importance to the evidence given by it, hence it is now seeking help from the US and FBI to investigate the calls that happened when the attack took place

 He alleged that Section 370 in Kashmir was only due to Nehru, while Dr

 Speaking on the Kashmir issue of the return of Kashmiri Pandits, Swamy further said that it is an integral part of India

 In Uttar Pradesh's Kerath district, some youths who were living in the neighborhood, barged into her house and burnt her alive

 According to the girl's father, some residents living in her neighborhood used to harass her daughter a lot
 16 agast ko aropiyon ne unki beti ko tution se ghar lautate vakt jabaran ek mobile phone diya tha
 The accused had told the girl that if she did not pick up the phone, her parents would be killed
 pita ke mutabik is bare main jab mukhya aaropee ke ghar jaakar uski shikaayat bhi kii gai thi
 The family of the accused had then apologized and said that this will not happen now
 lekin iske baad aaropee ke pita sahit kuch ladakon ne ghar me ghuskar unki beti ke upar kerosine chhidaka auraag lagaadi
 Due to which the girl got scorched by 75 percent

 kendriya swasthya mantri jagat prakaash nadda ne 26 march ko odisha ke bhubaneshwar main rotawiras tike rotawac ko rashtriya tikaakaran kaarykram main shaamil karne kii shuruyaat karte hue ye baaten kahin
 He could hardly have guessed that his own obstacles would be stuck in his path
 aresas se jude sanghathan swadeshi jaagran manch ne bharat main nirmit rotawiras ke tike ko viksit karne main bill and melinda gates foundation kii madad par sawaal uthaakar sarkaar ko chetavanee di he ki foundation kii madad uske sujhaaye gaye kaamon main nahin, desh ke logon kii ore se sujhaaye gaye kaamon main hi leni chahie
 Ashwini Mahajan, the national co-convenor of the forum, says, "the charity of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is fine, but also the fact that its board has multinational health sector companies that will have their own natural interests
" ''bharat main nirmit rotawac ko sarkaar ne pehle charan main odisha, andhra pradesh, haryana or himachal pradesh main lagu kiya he
 Here children are being provided free vaccine
 lekin ab swasthya mantri nadda kii mushkil yah he ki desh main nirmit jis tike ko ve ugantarkari maan rahe hai, us par swadeshi kii vakaalat karne vaali sanstha hi gambhir sawaal uthaa rahi he
 After the forum has been articulated in this way, the debate has started whether a country like India needs this rotavirus vaccine or not
 Apart from this, questions have also been raised on the study regarding vaccine trials and its effects
 kyon uth rahe hai sawaal?rotawiras ek prakaar kaa sankramak vishaanu he, jisase khaskar paanch saal tak ke bacchon main antrashoth, ulti or dast hota he
 Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health (now transferred to ICMR, Indian Council of Drug Research)
 rakesh kumaar kehete hai, ''rotawiras se duniya main jitne bacchon kii mrityu ho rahi he usamen har paanchvaan baccha bhartiya he
 "the government says that keeping this in mind, the rotavirus vaccine has been included in the national program
 lekin bharat main rotawac tike ko viksit karne kii prakriya or uskaa asar hi sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 It has been built by Hyderabad-based company Bharat Biotech, which was selected by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in the year 2000, when the company did not have any of its licensed products at the time
 bharat biotech ko bharat sarkaar ke biotechnology vibhaag (debiti) ne bhi vittiya sahaayta di
 Interestingly, the government did not make any mou while assisting the company
 itnaa hi nahin, foundation jisane bhartiya company ko madad di, kya vah epasiare kaa ulanghan nahin he? mahajan bataate hai, ''foundation fahrren countribution regulation act (epasiare) ke tahat panjikrut hi nahin he
 The Modi government had revoked the licenses of 15,000 foreign entities receiving foreign aid registered under the FCRA, but the Gates Foundation remained untouched because the Gates Foundation, not FERA, works as a liaison office under FEMA, hence from FCRA Being saved '' ve yah bhi jodate hai ki tikaakaran karnaa saraahneey he, lekin pehle hamen apni jarurat ko khud tay karnaa hoga
 Policies are being affected! The policy process of the government in the case of vaccine is also under question
 kisi bhi vaxin ko chunane se pehle swasthya mantralay kii sanstha neshnal technical adwijuri group of ikvaunijeshan (natagi) kii sifarish jaruri he
 But in 2013, the Equalization Technical Support Unit (ITSU) was formed to support Natagi, whose job is to coordinate the details of the meeting, agenda, presentation, etc
 lekin mantralay sutron ke mutabik, dilachasp pahalu he ki itsu ke sabhi 32 sadsy bill and melinda gates foundation kii ore se chune jate hai or unhen vetan bhi foundation se miltaa he
 Confirming the fact that the officials of the ministry argue that the scope of work has increased, Natagi gets the secretariat facility from Itsu
 lekin is bare main india today ke saath i-mail se hui baatcheet main bill and melinda gates foundation kaa kahana he, ''itsu main foundation kaa koi karmchaaree karyrat nahin he or tikaakaran se judaa har nitigat faisla bharat sarkaar ke daayre main aata he
 We would also like to say that in August 2013 we gave a grant to the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) to set up Etsu
 yah unit swasthya mantralay ko prabandhkeey or takneekee madad muhaiyaa karaane ke liye sarkaar ke saath ek emoyu ke tahat lagaai gai thi
 "the question that arises is that those working for a foreign institution may not be able to influence the internal discussion of the ministry but it can hardly be denied that the news and attitude of the meeting will not reach that institution
" natagi ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''itsu na sirf agenda banaata he balki baithak ke kis bindu ko kaise note karnaa he, vah usee par nirbhar karata he
 Itsu also decides which presentation or paper will be kept in the meeting
 '' mahajan bhi britain kii global justise nau sanstha kii report ke hawaale se kehete hai ki 'gates foundation apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar krishi or dawa kshetra main lagi badi bahurashtriya companiyon ke hiton main nitiyaan banavaane main lipt he
 According to him, only after this report, the Government of India has put the Foundation on the watch list
 unka kahana he ki swasthya mantralay main 365 visheshgy salaahkaar salaah dete the jinhen mantralay ne nahin, balki videshi companiyon ne niyukt kiya tha
 Although Ministry officials dismiss the point of 365 but believe that experts will have to be hired due to increasing work and pressure to produce results immediately
 sarkaar videshi sanstha ke prabhaav main nitigat faisle ke aarope ko sire se khaarij kar rahi he
 The Ministry of Health says that it takes four to five years to implement any vaccine
 rotawac ko lekar technical sab cameti kii do baithken disambar 2013 or april 2014 main huin, jab centre main upie sarkaar thi
 But the meeting of the big body, Natagi, which recommends this, was held in June 2014 after the formation of Narendra Modi's government at the Center, in which the decision to include the rotavirus vaccine in the universal vaccination program was taken by majority vote rather than consensus
 iske baad 9 march 2015 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rotawac vaxin ko launch kiya
 "we work on the recommendations of the Technical Sub Committee and Natagi, not on the advice of the Gates Foundation," says an official
 is bare main do baar sab cameti, natagi ke baad ipisi (ampaward program cameti jisamen swasthya sachiv hote hai) or phir ems (mishan study group jisamen mantri str kii charchaa hoti he) kii baithak ke baad vaxin ko program main shaamil kiya gaya
 The Gates Foundation also says that it has been working towards giving people a better and healthier life by partnering with the central and state governments in India since 2000 (then there was the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Center)
 vaxin or trial par andeh kyon?swasthya mantralay ke sutara bataate hai ki ek taraf foundation ne bharat kii aisi company ko chunaa jiske paas vaxin ke kshetra main koi anubhav nahin tha, lekin use vaxin viksit karne ke liye madad di
 On the other hand, advocating the inclusion of the vaccine in the government program while shielding the data, which shows personal interest
 lekin gates foundation is tarah ke aaropon ko khaarij karata he
 In its reply, the Foundation states, "it has no commercial interest in the production and distribution of rotavirus vaccines in India
" bharat sarkaar hi apane kaarykram ke liye is vaxin ke chayan, kharid or vitaran ke liye puri tarah jimmedaar he
 However, the difference in vaccine trials in India and the US is only pointing to a conflict of interest
 america main 1998 main jab rotashield vaxin kaa trial 10,000 bacchon par hua to usase 3 bacchon main intssepshan (aant ke ek hissaa duusare hisse ke andar janaa) paaya gaya, jiske baad use pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 After this the trial of Rotatech vaccine was done at 60,000
 lekin bharat main bane rotawac kaa trial behad chote str par desh ke teen kendron—vellore, pune, dilli main mahaj 6,799 bacchon par kiya gaya jisamen 4,532 ko vaxin diya gaya
 According to the government, this study found 23 cases of intussusception
 agar is aankade kaa bade str par adhyayan kiya jaae to bhi rotawac kii vajah se 10,000 main 37
 26 without vaccines if 5 children are victims of intussusception
 36 bachche
 That is, 11 cases were found more
 lekin mantralay ke dipti kamishnar dow
 Pradeep Haldar says that even without vaccine, 48-50 cases of intussusception are found every year out of 1 lakh children
 lekin is aankade ke lihaaj se bhi rotawac ke trial se nikle adhyayan ko dekhen to tike kii vajah se isamen prati ek lakh bacchon main 110 cese or jud jate hai
 Member of Natagi and the pediatrician who gave a disagreement note on the decision to implement the rotavirus vaccine at the meeting and the Head of Department at St
 Stephen's Hospital Delhi, Dr
 jaikab pulial india today se kehete hai, ''sarkaar ke aankadon ko hi dekhen to rotawac vaxin main america main epad se pratibandhit rotashield vaxin se paanch se das guna to antarrashtriya license praapt vaxin rotatech se 70 guna zyada intssepshan kaa jokhim he
 He also alleged that the sample size was deliberately kept low so that the outcome of the intussusception is not visible so the trial data in Vellore is not being made public, where the highest number of intussions took place and the results of the three centers were combined
 unicef ke health specialist dow
 Satish Gupta also believes that the sample size of the trial in India was small
 unka kahana he ki abhi chaar rajyon main ise shuru kiya gaya he or nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 If cases of intussusception rise in these states, it can also be stopped
 mantralay ke mutabik, charanwar lagu karne kii vajah rotawac vaxin ke mahaj ek karod dose hi uplabdh the
 Pediatrician and Medical Superintendent of Holy Family Hospital in Delhi, Dr
 sukvabul varsi bhi maanati hai ki bharat main bade paimaane par trial nahin hua he aise main uskaa data sahi nahin ho paaegaa
 Vaccine: The problem or solution in a country like India where malnutrition, non-availability of clean drinking water, sanitation and standard of living are lower than in western countries, such a vaccine should be given without devising better infrastructure to overcome the problem or No, there is a debate about this
 swadeshi jaagran manch kaa kahana he ki isliye tikaakaran videshi companiyon ke mutabik nahin hona chahie
 But the Health Ministry argues that rotavirus has nothing to do with indigenous conditions like hygiene and vaccines are the only option to deal with it
 unicef ke dow
 "rota has nothing to do with sanitation," says Gupta
 haalanki tike se diaria ko puri tarah nahin roka ja saktaa
 Only one-third will be covered by this, sanitation and ORS will be required for the rest
 '' lekin dow
 Warsi believes that the vaccine should be adopted as the last option
 ve kahati hai, ''yah sahi he ki diaria se hone vaali mauton kii sankhya zyada he lekin isse nipatane ke liye pehle hamen swatchta ke sabhi upayon par jor dena chahie
 If you do not insist on cleanliness, then the vaccine will also have no effect
 '' ve yah bhi kahati hai ki pashchimi deshon main vaxin kaa asar 90 fisadi ke kareeb isliye he kyonki vahaan swatchta par dhyaan rahata he, jabaki bharat main yah 50 fisadi ke kareeb hi he
 However, UNICEF experts argue that the impact of both foreign and Indian vaccines is 60-62%
 lekin rotawiras vaxin ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par mantralay ke atirikt sachiv dow
 C
 ke
 Mishra and the then Joint Secretary Dr
 rakesh kumaar kehete hai, ''rotawiras kii vaxin privet str par 2009 se chal rahaa he
 No one questioned then
 ab jab 4-5 hajaar main milane vaali vaxin garibon ko muft muhaiyaa karai ja rahi he to haituba kyon machaai ja rahi he? '' lekin sarkari tikaakaran ke faisle se judi badi sanstha natagi ke sadsy dow
 Pulial says that the best treatment for diarrhea is salt-sugar solution in water and special care should be taken with it
 unka maananaa he ki rotawac tike kaa sabase zyada dushprabhav gaanvon main ho saktaa he
 There are no experts there
 intssepshan kii sthiti main garib uske ilaaj kaa kharch nahin uthaa saktaa
 But the opinion of the Gates Foundation is completely different from the opinion of these doctors
 uski daleel he, ''rog kii vyapak rokthaam-niyantran ke liye tike ahm hote hai or shishu mrityu dar main kami laane ke vyapak samaadhaan kaa hissaa hote hai
 It is the safest and economical way to prevent disease and save crores of lives
 '' mantralay bhi yah maanata he ki intssepshan ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa, isliye puri nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 Dr
 Vellore's demand to make the Vellore data of the trial of the rotavirus vaccine public
 pulial ne dilli hycourt main piiel daakhil kii thi lekin pulial khud natagi ke sadsy hai isliye court ne gopneey data dene kii maang ko janhit yachika ke liye upyukt nahin mana
 In this case he also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi, but his concern was not justified there too
 lekin ab is maamle par sidhe sangh se judi sanstha saamne aa gai he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen whether the government takes honest steps to remove these fears or it goes ahead

 a person named Rupesh was shot dead around 9 pm on Sunday night in Delhi's Ketamur Nagarilake
 34 saal ke roopesh ko gambhir haalat main aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Angry locals created a ruckus after this incident
 ugr bheed nepulisaki gadiyon main todphod kii or motorcykilon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 The police who arrived to control the uproar were also stoned
 roopesh ko drugs taskaron ne goli maari!sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki roopesh ko drugs taskaron ne goli maari he
 According to people, the liquor business is openly done in Timur Nagar area
 iske khilaaf ilaake ke log lagaataar aawaaj uthaa rahe the
 Rupesh and his brother have also complained to the police several times in writing
 aarope he ki nashe ke kaarobaari isi baat se naaraaz chal rahe the
 It is being told that on Friday night, two people reached there when Rupesh was standing outside his house
 inke bich aropiyon se roopesh kii kuch kahasuni hui or phir aaropee goli markar faraar ho gaye
 CCTV footage of the incident has also been revealed
 footage main do shaks daudte hue aa rahe hai
 Meanwhile, a shot is seen in Rupesh's chest
 goli lagane ke kuch second ke baad roopesh jameen par gir padataa he
 Rupesh was rushed to the hospital immediately after being shot, where his condition remains very critical
 vahiin duusari taraf ghatana kii soochna paa kar maukey par pahunchi police ko bheed ke gusse kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The police also had to do aerial firing to control the crowd

 South East KDCP, Chinawal Viswal said that at present the situation is under control and precautionary police force has been deployed
 police kii maane to abhi tak goli maarane kii asal vajah kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he
 On the other hand, the allegations of the local people also cannot be ignored
 ek 10 saal ke ladke par apni hi umr ke ek ladke kaa rape karne kaa aarope laga he
 During the court hearing, it was told that the boy raped the school toilet along with his classmate
 court main kaha gaya ki class chal rahi thi or isi dauraan aaropee ladke ne apane sahpaathee se kaha ki vah uske saath sex karnaa chahta he
 Hearing this, the boy felt that he was joking and he refused
 lekin class khatm hone ke baad jab peedit baccha toilet gaya to aaropee ladke ne uskaa peechha kiya or use pakad liya
 After this, the boy pushed her towards the sink and then raped her
 do saal puraani yah vaardaat euke ke wales kii he
 During the hearing at Mold Crown Court on Tuesday, it was told that the accused boy committed rape after watching online porn
 abhiyojan paksh ke vakil karl scolj ne kaha, 'is maamle main yah saaf he ki bachche ne pornography main jo dekha use khud karne kii thaan lee'
 He said that the pornographic material on the internet is responsible for this accident
 aaropee ladkaa ab 12 saal kaa ho gaya he
 He is accused of raping and abetting his classmate for sexual activity
 rape ke baad peedit ladke ko lagane laga tha ki agar logon ko is bare main pataa chalegaa to use homosexual kaha jayega
 And for this fear he did not say anything to anyone
 ghatana kaa khulaasa pichley saal tab hua jab teacher ne peedit ladke se us afvaah ko lekar poochtacha kii jisamen kaha ja rahaa tha ki usne apni garlfriend ko antarang tareeke se chuaa he
 During interrogation, the victim told the teacher that a boy studying with her had raped her in the toilet
 usee raat peedit ne apane gharavaalon ko rape ke bare main bataaya, jiske turant baad police main report darj karvaa di gai
 The victim says that he hates the accused very much because he used to be very good in front of the teacher, but he used to talk in the playground
 vahiin, aaropee kaa kahana he ki usne peedit ladke se na to sex ke bare main baat kii or na hi uskaa rape kiya
 The case is currently under trial
 pehali khabar yah he ki lalu prasad yadav par chal rahe chaara ghotaale ke ek maamle main sajaa guuruuvaar ko sunai jaaegi
 It was earlier to be recited on Wednesday
 duusari khabar ye ki sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav or rashtriya janata dal or congress ke teen anya netaaon ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa notice jari kiya he
 The court has issued this notice of contempt to the four people for their statement in the context of RJD President Lalu Prasad, convicted in the fodder scam
 iff teen netaaon main rajd ke varisht netaa or purv mantri raghuvansh prasad singh, rajd pravaktaa manoj jha or congress netaa manish tiwari hai
 In fact, Lalu Prasad was convicted in the fodder scam on 23 December when RJD leaders questioned the acquittal of former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra
 unhone kaha tha ki mishra jati se brahman hai to unhen bari kar diya gaya or lalu pichhadi jati se taalluk rakhte hai to unhen doshi tehraaya gaya
 In response to this notice, all of them will have to appear in court on 23 January
 iskaa matlab he ki rajd ek gahare sankat main funs chuki he
 Lalu Yadav is in jail when the party needed him most
 lalu prasad jitne din jail main rahenge, party ke liye chunavi dushwariyaan utani hi badhati jaaengi
 But now one more question arises that in the absence of Lalu Prasad, who will be the party's ambassador? Now senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has assumed that only Tejashwi Yadav will succeed the RJD President
 yah thik he ki apni santulit or paripakv raajnneeti ke liye tejasvi ko thodaa bahut sammaan hasil he
 But it is also certain that right now it will take time for him to fit into the mold of his father
 duusari taraf unke bade bhai tejpratap zyada ugr or takaraav vaala he
 In such a situation, if Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that by rule and legally after the father, the son has the right and Tejashwi is the son of Lalu
 aisi sthiti main sabhi log unhen uttaradhikari maanate hai
 Also, besides many senior RJD leaders like Jagdanand Singh, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Ramchandra Purave, Shivanand Tiwari, many former ministers and legislators may object to Raghuvansh as Tejashwi Yadav is also facing allegations from several investigating agencies
 aisi sthiti main tejasvi kanoonee pachade main padate hai or jail jate hai to kya rajd tejasvi ko sweekaar karegi?baharhaal, baat pehle rajd main tejasvi kii aguai par muhar lagane kii
 Dynasty is nothing new in India
 baat rajd main vanshavaad kii bhi nahin he, kyonki lalu jab jail gaye the to kisi taqatvar netaa ko kursii saunpane kii bajaay patni rabari devi ko mukhyamantri banaakar gaye the
 People did not like it because then it was believed that Lalu is the leader of social justice and his party is working towards advancing socialist principles
 bharat main vanshavaad ke varchasv par lekh patric french ne kaam kiya he, unka teen saal pehle kaa adhyayan bataata he ki bharat main loksabhaa main 30 saal se kam umr ke har saansad kaa raajnneetik khandaan se rishta he
 If such an incident had happened elsewhere in the world, there would have been a ruckus, but we Indians have accepted it
 patric french ne likhaa he, agar yah rujhaan jari rahaa to bhartiya sansad main sirf khandaani raajnneetijna hi bache rah jaaenge, or desh par khandaanon kaa hi puri tarah shashan hoga
 Doesn't this mean that the French are announcing the rise of new princely states in India! Take the statement of Raghuvansh Prasad in the same context, where the picture looks worse, where the tapa-tapaya leader like him is seizing the crown of Yuvraj
 is
 voter bhi apane dharm, jati or upnaam ke aadhaar par vot kar rahaa he
 (now this is not surprising), although the Lalu dynasty, which stands against the established political trends, may seem imposing at first, but when the senior party leaders are ready to cover it, it does not give healthy signs
 tejasvi kaa netritv bhale hi bade netaaon ko manjuur ho, lekin unki raah aasaan nahin rahane vaali
 With Lalu behind bars, not only Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap will also have to deal with 80 party mlas

 In such a situation there will be a risk of defections and divisions in the party
 vaise lalu ne jab bhi jail yatra kii he, vah unke kariyar main teji laane vaala hi sabit hua he, jaisaa ki apatkaal ke baad hua tha or tab unhone pehla loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 But, there is a difference of forty years from seventy-seven to the present day, the story has become a little different
 (manjit thakur, india today main vishesh samvaadadaata hai) The reality of Ram Rahim, who is running the Sultanate of hypocrisy under the guise of religion, has come to the fore
 lekin ab ram rahim ko lekar ek aisa khulaasa hua he, jo sabase hat kar he
 In the search of Ram Rahim's camp, police have found many such things, including intelligence cameras, pen drives and hundreds of hard disks, which are generally used for espionage
 to kya ram rahim dere main aane vaale logon or viviipi logon kii jasusi karata tha
 Were they supervised
 agar aisa tha to kyon?suna aapane baba kya kya kar lete hai
 But what Babaram Rahimane said is incomplete
 hamase puraa suniye
 Baba does not just sing
 gavaa bhi lete he
 They even dance when they dance
 actor, diarector, produsar
 doctor
 master or pravachan dene ke alaava baba khilaadi bhi hai
 It is also difficult to guess such a big player
 baba ke jis nae khel kaa khulaasa ham karne ja rahen he, uske mutabik baba james bond yani jasoos bhi hai
 They are also not small
 sharalakahoms
 Karamchand and Byomesh Bakshi are spies older than Baba
 court ke aadesh ke baad ram rahim ke sirsa dere kii talaashi main kai hairaan karne vaale raaj baahar aa rahe hai
 The intelligence report of the court commissioner has been handed over to Aaj Tak, and what this report is telling is the living proof of the most serious allegations against Ram Rahim till date
 court kamishnar ne punjab haryana hoicourt main jo senetigeshan report saunpi he uske mutabik baba ke dere se ek obi vine, paanch spai camere, 68 hard discs baraamad hui hai
 65 hard disks of which were hidden in 2 briefcases
 isse pehle bhi dere se 65 hard discs baraamad ho chuki hai
 a total of 133 hard disks have been recovered from the ashram so far
 iske alaava ashram se 11 pen drive bhi mili hai
 Earlier, 92 pen drives have been received from the ashram
 is tarah se ab tak ashram se 103 pen drive mil chuki hai
 166 cds, 17 laptops and 9 computers have been recovered from the ashram
 ashram se 29 mobile phone mili hai
 There was also an attempt to break a mobile phone out of it
 court kamishnar e ke es panvar nedera sachcha sauda ashramase ye tamaam saamaan jabt kiye hai
 But now based on the items found in the sanitation report, speculations have started that there was something wrong with Baba's intention
 varanaa obi vine, jisase video ko aplink kiya jaataa he
 And the spy cameras that make intelligence videos are what Baba's ashram needed
 khufia camaron, computer or sidi pen drive kaa ye jakhira khud ko sant kehane vaale shaks ke thikaane se baraamad ho to shaq hona to laazmi he
 And if this person is Gurmeet Singh aka Ram Rahim, then definitely believe that something else was going on in the name of Dera
 ye khel kya tha
 Its secret is about to be destroyed
 baba ko apane raaj fash hone ke dar is kadar sata rahaa he ki usne court se guhaar lagaai he ki uske ye raaj media kii najaron se dur rakhe jaaen
 After these suspicious items recovered from Baba's camp, questions are now arising whether Ram Rahim was involved in espionage activities? Are Ram Rahim's strings attached to any detective organization? Was Ram Rahim to endanger the security of the country? Why did Ram Rahim install spy cameras in the ashram? Does the hard disk contain spy or sting videos? Whom did Ram Rahim spy and why? But the revelations are not enough
 kai or baaten saamne ai hai, jo chankane vaali hai masalan, dere se maanav twachaa vaale 17 jaar baraamad hue hai
 6 files related to abortion have been recovered from the hospital of Dera
 in sab ke alaava dere se 7 diariyaan bhi baraamad hui hai
 When the skin bank of the Dera Hospital, which calls itself the Messenger of God, did not get the license, where did it get its donor? aspataal se garbhpaat kii 6 filein milin jo ye sawaal puch rahi hai ki aakhir sant ke ashram main garbhpaat kii naubat kyon ai? or un saat diariyon main kis kis kaa kaccha chittha band he
 Now the investigation agencies have to find answers to all these questions in further investigation
 loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle uttar pradesh main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan main sendhamari kii he
 The BJP may field sp's sitting MP Pravin Nishad as its candidate for victory in Gorakhpur, a stronghold of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 lekin samaajawaadee party ne bhi bijepi ke is tod kaa jawaab dhund nikaala he
 Before the talks of Nishad Party and NDA reached any stage, SP has once again given ticket to Nishad candidate from here
 sapa ne praveen nishad kii jagah rambhual nishad ko maidan main utaara he
 Let us know that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath does not want to let go of the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat with his hands
 kyonki yahaan se unke guru mahant avaidhyanath saansad hua karte the iske baad yogi adityanath yahaan se 1998 se lagaataar saansad chune jate rahe
 He resigned after becoming CM in 2017
 iske baad hue upachunaav main bijepi ne puraa jor lagaaya tha ki yah seat barkaraar rahe lekin sapa ne yah sapana chakanachur kar diya
 In such a situation, Yogi and the party are churning out who should be given tickets from here, so that in any case, this seat will remain with the BJP
 yogi or sanjay nishad kii hui thi mulakatshuukravaar ko praveen nishad ke pita sanjay nishad ne lakhanu main yogi adityanath se mulaakaat kii
 After the meeting of the two, there was a discussion that both the parties could contest together
 yogi adityanath se milane ke baad sanjay nishad ne kaha ki upi ke siem ne mujhe aashwaasan diya ki hamaari shikayaton ko suna jayega or unase nipta jayega
 He said that the Nishad Party will contest the elections on its symbol
 endie tay karegaa ki koun kahaan se chunaav ladega
 According to the information, BJP can give Gorakhpur and Jaunpur seats to Nishad Party
 praveen nishad ko jahaan gorakhpur se tikat mil saktaa he to vahiin jonpur ke purv saansad dhananjay singh nishad party se pratyaashee ho sakate hai
 That is why Nishad is betting on the candidates that they should give 3 in Gorakhpur
 5 lakh matadaata nishad jati ke hai
 These same Nishad voters played a key role in Pravin Nishad's victory in the by-election held last year
 upachunaav main sapa or basapa ne saajha ummidavaar khadaa kiya tha
 Even in the earlier elections, the SP and the BSP have been giving tickets to the Nishad candidate to get the votes of the Nishad caste people
 lekin unke vot bant jate the
 Last year, due to the common candidates in the by-elections, the votes of the Nishad caste people went to the same account, which resulted in the BJP losing here
 ab jab sapa-basapa gathbandhan ek baar phir nishad ummidavaar par daanv laga rahaa he or charchaa he ki bijepi bhi praveen nishad ko yahaan se pratyaashee bana sakati he to aise main yahaan par chunavi ladaai dilachasp hone kii puri ummid he
 Sanjay Nishad, the president of Sanjay Nishadnishad party, who spoke before the meeting with Yogi, said on Friday that we are not with the alliance and the Nishad party will contest the Lok Sabha elections independently
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh yadav ke ravaiye se hamaare kaaryakarta or kor cameti naaraaz he
 Sanjay Nishad said that Akhilesh Yadav had said that he would declare seats for our party
 lekin unhone apane postaron main hamaari party kaa naam or ek shabd tak nahin likhvaya
 Sanjay Nishad said that now we are free and all options are open before us
 nishad party akele bhi lard sakati hai or anya vikalpon par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 Samajwadi Party candidate from Gorakhpur, Rambhual Nishad, claimed on Saturday that Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad quit the SP-BSP-RLD alliance because he was allegedly given a lot of money from the BJP
 haalanki, sapa pratyaashee ke is daawey ko sanjay nishad ke putr praveen nishad ne sire se khaarij kar diya
 Attacking Sanjay Nishad, the SP-BSP-RLD alliance candidate Rambhual said that Sanjay Nishad only raised money for the money given to him by the BJP
 vah dhokheybaaj he or samaaj ke sammaan ke liye kabhi nahin lard sakate
 The current MP of Gorakhpur, Pravin Nishad said that he (SP) kept me in the dark, told me to prepare for the election and at the same time made Rambhual Nishad a party candidate
 jahaan tak bijepi se paise lene kaa aarope rambhual nishad laga rahe hai vah puri tarah se aadharahin he
 He claimed that his demand, that the Nishad community be included in the Scheduled Castes category, has been accepted by the state government

 pyaaj ke bhav main ai teji ke kaaran achche pyaaj kii fasal liye pune gultechdi bazaar main aane vaale kisaanon ke chehere par in dinon raunak chai hui he
 The faces of the farmers are seen blossoming and even if not, if the farmers believe that after three years, their onion crop is getting 40 rupees per kg
 somvaar ko jab 'aaj tak' ne pyaaj mandi main bhav kaa jayja liya, to vyapaaree or kisaan khush dikhaai de rahe the
 According to businessman Jadhav, after three years, good days have come for onions
 pehle pyaaj kaa bahut kam bhav aayaa karata tha
 From the perspective of customers, the rising prices of onion may make them cry immediately after Diwali as interest rates will touch the sky
 bhav main teji aane kii vajahpichley dinon maharashtra samet kai pashchimi rajya main baari barish hone se holcel market main pyaaj aana kam ho gaye
 On the one hand good onion is coming down in the market, the effect has increased due to increasing demand
 pune ke gultechdi market main ravivaar or somvaar ko pyaaj 3500 se 4000 rupee quintal yani 100 kilo pyaaj ke liye 4000 rupee bhav ho gaya he or ye pyaaj dilli va anya bade shaharon main pahunchate-pahunchate tak 55 rupye prati kilo ho jayega
 Normally, 150 trucks of onion are traded in Mandi, Pune, but there is less arrival of onions due to rain
 achche pyaaj ke 60 se 70 trek aa rahe hai, jinke bhav 35 se 40 rupye prati kilo rah rahe hai
 At the same time, 50 trucks of light quality onions, which are priced at Rs 15 to 20 per kg
 bhav achche milane se kisaan khushmandi main 'aaj tak' ke samvaadadaata kii mulaakaat us kisaan se hui jise das oktober ko pyaaj ke liye 25 rupee prati kilo kaa bhav mila tha or 24 oktober ko usne 40 rupye prati kilo bhav se apana pyaaj bechaa
 The farmer says that all people should participate in the happiness of the farmers
 kai baar kisaanon ko 2 se 5 rupee kilo ke bhav se pyaaj bechnaa padataa he, to tab wo bhi dukhi hote hai
 The government should not interfere: In the business market, traders told that due to continuous rains, onions are spoiled and farmers are not able to send the goods and due to this, if the goods are low, then the price is bound to be high
 pune market main vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki pichley teen saal kisaanon ko nuksaan sahan karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Onion farmers had been crying for three years
 abaki baar pyaaj kisaanon ke liye khushiyaan laayaa he, to sarkaar ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 Imran Khan's party Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) has emerged as the largest party in the elections held in Pakistan
 haalanki pitiai ko sarkaar banane ke liye neshnal assembly main bahumat sabit karnaa he
 Imran Khan needs at least 51 percent of the total votes of the total members of the National Assembly for a clear majority
 pakistan kii 342 siton vaali neshnal assembly main kisi bhi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye kul 172 siton kii jarurat he
 The PTI leadership has claimed the support of at least 170 mps
 isamen nirdaleey or gathbandhan kii partiyon ke navnirvaachit saansad shaamil hai

 PML-N and PPP have announced to join hands to challenge pm's contender Imran Khan
 pakistan muslim lig- navaj (PML-N) ke paas 64 or pakistan piples party (pipipi) ke paas 43 site hai
 However, the move to elect Imran Khan as Prime Minister from a coalition of a few small parties will not make much difference, but it will reduce his seats in Parliament
 jisase unke liye bahumat sabit karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Significantly, Imran Khan's party Pakistanistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) has emerged as the largest party by winning 116 seats in the elections held on 25 July

 After meeting Chinese journalists on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted one after another on microblogging website Twitter, in which he wrote expressing his opinion about the mutual relations between India and China

 uttar pradesh kekushinagaramen guuruuvaar subah ek bada haadasa hua tha
 The school van (tata Magic) was hit by the train at the unmanned railway crossing
 jis haadase main 13 bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 a high-level meeting was convened by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal after the accident, wherein the removal of unmanned railway crossings from the mission boards across the country was discussed in mission mode
 mantralay ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'deshbhar se maanav rahit railway crocingon ko hataane ko lekar baithak main bahuaiami ranneetik charchaaen kii gayin
 In which aspects such as rail-friendling at crossings, converting routes, under-bridges and over-bridges were discussed
 'saath hi maanav rahit cosing ko hataane ke kaary kii pragati ko online madhyam se website par bhi saajha karne kii baat kahi gai, jisase ki kaaryon par saarvajanik nigaraanee rakhi ja sake
 The official said that the target of removing unmanned crossings from 11 mandal areas has been fixed by September 2018, while the targets of the remaining 5 mandals will also be fixed soon
 mantralay ke adhikariyon ke anusaar maanav rahit crossing ko hataane main 4 varsh pehle ke ausat se tulana kii jaae to abhi do-tihaai zyada raftaar se kaam ho rahaa he
 Now only 3479 unmanned rail crossings are left on large lines across the country
 driver kii laaparvaahee se hua haadasahaalanki haal hi main hue is haadase par sarkaar safai detii najar ai or laaparvaahee driver ke sir daal di
 Railway says that this accident happened due to the negligence of the driver
 crossing par get mitra maujuud tha, jisane driver ko ishaara bhi kiya, lekin driver ke dwaara ishaara nahin dekha gaya
 At the same time, it is also being said that the driver had installed earphones, due to which he did not hear the sound of the train
 badal gaye do mantri, lekin nahin badale bayaangauratlab he ki isse pehle bhi aise haadase hote rahe hai
 Exactly similar incident took place in Bhadohi, UP in July 2016
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki us vakt bhi railway ne haadase par safai dete hue is baar kii tarah hi bayaanbaji kii thi or aise vaayade bhi kiye the
 That was the statement of the railway at that time which is being given today
 is tarah se aap kah sakate hai ki 2 saal, 2 haadase or 2 rail mantri badalane ke baad bhi railway ke bayaan ek jaise hi hai
 What was the statement at the time of Bhadohi accident? In July 2016, Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh also had an accident like Kushinagar
 us vakt maanavrahit railway crossing main tej raftaar train se schuli vine takaraa gai thi, jisamen 8 bacchon kii maut ho gai thi
 Subsequently, the then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had tweeted that, Gate Mitra had tried to stop the driver but the driver ignored his warning, due to which the accident happened
 Gate Mitra was available at the time of accident but sadly van driver ignored his warning which resulted in this sad incident 2 / 3— Suresh Prabhu (@sureshpprabhu)july 25, 2016ek jaise haadase-ek jaisi theoryin donon haadason (kushinagar or bhadohi) main kaaphi samanthaayen hai
 In both cases, the school van has been hit by the train
 itnaa hi nahin shuruaati jaanch main bhi donon hi maamalon main ek hi jaisi theory ko saamne rakhaa gaya rahaa he
 According to which, Gate Mitra was present at the unmanned gate
 saath hi driver ne yearphone lagaaya tha, jis vajah se wo train kii aawaaj nahin sun sakaa
 Arvind Kejriwal has responded to the allegations of spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar

 i am deeply hurt that u have written such strong sentiments against me
 
 
 
 
 
 - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) April 4, 2014 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar wrote in one of his articles that Kejriwal's hidden agenda has come to the fore with everything that happened in Delhi
 padhein shri shri ravishankar ne kya likhaahjab aam aadmi party bhartiya raajnneeti ke patal par ubhadi to logon ko laga ki yuva or sakriy netaa desh kii vyavastha main sudhaar laane kii disha main kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 However, it started with the non-political movement
 main arvind kejariwal se ek bindu par sahamat hum ki raajnneeti main vyaapt bhrashtachar kii safai ke liye raajnneeti main ghusna padegaa
 For this reason, i have always advocated leaving the bullets to the Naxalites and moving towards the ballot
 main yah dekh kar khush hua ki jharkhand main pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan kai yuva logon ne bhaag liya
 In today's politics, for the common man, participation in these elections is limited to casting votes only
 is nai party ke gathan ne un lakhon logon ke man main yah aashaa jagaa di jo bhrashtachar or raajnneeti main aparaadhiyon ke bolbaale se pareshaan hai
 Many people who subscribe to AAP want to see a better India
 is party ne logon se sidhaa sampark kiya or dilli vidhansabha chunaav main chaunkaane vaala rigelt diya
 Later, AAP formed the government with the support of Congress
 logon ko yah aashaa thi ki nai sarkaar bhrashtra netaaon par karrwai karegi
 If the AAP had fallen after taking strict measures against corruption, its credibility and purity would have increased further
 lekin party ko istipha dekar dilli chhod desh kii raajnneeti main utarane kaa galat suzav diya gaya
 By doing this, Kejriwal showed that he is no different from other politicians, but his hidden political agenda came to the fore
 sasti lokapriyata, swavirodh, atimahatvakanksha or taanaashaahee ne ‘aap’ kii sakaaratmak chhavi ko mailaa kar diya or turant hi kai bade naam bhram mukt ho kar party se alag ho gaye
 Now Kejriwal says that he is satisfied with the fractured mandate in this election and is talking about a mid-term election in the next two years
 yah desh kii arthvyavastha or suraksha ke lihaaj se unka bahut hi samvedanheen ravaiya darshata he
 He went to Gujarat for only four days and without any head began to criticize the development there

 The sighting of a tree was rare in Saurashtra until the early years of the 1990s and 2000s
 yahaan sookhaa is kadar haaavee tha ki logon ko akasar apane maweshiyon ko bechnaa padataa tha
 But today there is greenery here
 tab yahaan bijli bhi badi mushkil se din ke do ghante hi uplabdh hoti thi lekin aaj yahaan ke lagbhag sabhi gaanvon main bijli or pani kii suvidha maujuud he or prati vyakti aay main bhi kaaphi ijapha hua he
 Although Gujarat is not 100 percent corruption free, i am not hesitant to say that it is much better than it used to be
 apane aankadon ke saath eemaandaaree baratane vaale bijepi ke piem candidet narendra modi par kejariwal ne filmana andaaj main aarope lagaae
 If people have chosen AAP for the politics of the country and if they do the same here as they have done in Delhi then it will not be less than a disaster for the country
 jab arthvyavastha ke maamle main desh kii haalat acchhee nahin he aise main yah jokhim mol nahin liya ja saktaa
 We need a stable government at the center to bring the economy back on track and promote growth
 desh kii raajnneeti main kudane kii hadabadi main ‘aap’ ne un siddhanton ko taak par rakh diya jisaki vajah se uskaa janm hua
 AAP should have proved itself first in Delhi politics and then insisted on increasing its strength in other parts of the country
 use gaanvon main janaa chahie tha, panchayat or nagarpalika chunaav ladanaa chahie tha
 He should have worked on strengthening his cadre for governance
 isse duusari raajnneetik partiyon ko apni kaaryniti par dobaaraa sochane ke liye majaboor hona padataa
 Thus, with a strong foundation, this party would have been a boon for the country
 lekin itane saare virodhabhaason se chalate ‘aap’ ne apane raajnneetik sudhaar ke agenda ko ganvaa diya he
 There is also anger among Kejriwal's recent antics against those who were ever his staunch supporters
 wo desh ko ek vikalp dene aae the, lekin unhone desh ko vikalpaheen kar diya

 In the absence of former Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fast bowler Varun Aaron will lead Jharkhand in the East Zone Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 League Cricket Tournament
 isse dhoni ke is toornament ke liye uplabdh rahane kii atakalon par viraam lag gaya he
 With no T20 tournament schedule yet, there was speculation that Dhoni, who had captained the two World Cup winners before the IPL auction, could play for Jharkhand
 haalanki aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki dhoni ne chayan samiti se apane naam par vichaar nahin karne ko kaha
 This is a big shock for Mahi's fans, as he wanted to see him (dhoni) captaining once again
 haalanki pichley saal vijay hajaare trophy main dhoni jharkhand kii kaman sambhaal chuke hai
 For Jharkhand, players like Saurabh Tiwari, Ishank Jaggi, Virat Singh and Ishaan Kishan will land on the field
 philhal team india south africa daure par he or dhoni test nahin khelte hai, isliye vah apane parivaar ke saath zyada se zyada vakt bitaa rahe hai

 dilli sarkaar ke nursery admician main management kota khatm karne ke khilaaf 15 janvari ko dilli hai court main ek yachika daayar kii gai thi
 During the hearing of the case on Monday, the court said that the Delhi government can eliminate categories like smoking, non-veg but how can it snatch the autonomy of schools
 agali sunwaayee 28 ko, sarkari skulon par poocha sawalmaamle main hai court ne dilli sarkaar ko 5 janvari tak halafanama dene ko kaha he
 The next hearing will be on January 28
 tab tak ke liye philhal kii prakriya vaise hi jari rahegi jaise chal rahi he
 Only after the court's order will be clear which of the 62 categories will remain and which will be removed
 saath hi court ne sarkaar par sawaal uthaaya ki sarkari skulon ko sudhaarney ke liye sarkaar kya kar rahi he
 Is control of private schools only on the agenda of the government? At the same time, private schools said in the court that the Delhi government's order to abolish the quota of schools is against the High Court's Judgment
 hai court ne pehle kaha tha, apane niyam tay karenge schulskulon ne kaha ki kuch skool ho saktaa hannersry admicianke liye wo category bana rahe hon, jin par sarkaar ko aapatti ho jaise smoking, non-veg aadi
 But they are minority schools and their percentage is very less
 sarkaar saare skulon ko ek hi lakdi se haank rahi he
 The Delhi government's order to abolish the management quota is a carbon copy of the lg's order in 2013, on which the High Court itself has ordered that private schools not receiving aid will decide their own rules
 vahiin ganguli cameti ne bhi is baat kii sifarish kii thi kii privet skool kii autonomi rakhni jaruri he kyonki isse aage or achche privet skool or quality ajukeshan ko badhaava milegaa
 There is no evidence of misuse of quota
 The government has claimed that the schools misuse the management quota, but since the notification of 2007, the government has no evidence or case to prove its allegation
 agar koi skool phir bhi koi gadabadi karata he to sarkaar ke paas kanoon he uske khilaaf karwaai karne kaa
 In the EWS category, a lottery can be taken out but it is not practical to implement it in the other categories
 mata-pita apane bacchon ko kis tarah kii shiksha dena chaahate hai, kis skool main admician dilaanaa chaahate hai, is adhikaar ko unase nahin chhina ja saktaa 
 Relief for private schools Prabhash Raman, spokesperson for non-aided private schools, said that the court has understood their problems and this decision has brought relief for them
 vahiin skulon kii pairvi kar rahe vakil camel gupta ne kaha ki hamaari ladaai kaa mukhya mudda skulon kii autonami he
 At the same time, the court has also raised the question why the government is not paying attention to government schools

 There is no doubt that donating in temples is a matter of ultimate faith in God and the temple

 Free wi-fi does not seem to be a reality at the moment
 vaai faai par artiai se hua khulasakejariwal sarkaar ke free vaai faai ke bade vaade ko lekar artiai se ek bada khulaasa hua he
 The government may be claiming free wi-fi in East Delhi by December, but the reality of this promise is that even a year and a half after the formation of the government, the Kejriwal government does not even know how to give wi-fi to the people of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar ke soochna takanic vibhaag se chaunkaane vaala jawaab aayaa ki free vaai faai ke liye ab tak koi yojana hi nahin ban pai he
 In anticipation of free wifi, young Mukesh from Delhi applied RTI and asked that 1
 free vaai faai ko lekar sarkaar kii kya yojana he or yojana kii taaja sthiti kya he?2
 How many areas of Delhi have been provided with free wi-fi from 14 February to 4 June 2015? 3
 agar free vaai faai diya ja rahaa he to vaai faai dene vaali company koun he?4
 In the free wi-fi scheme, how much data will be given to people for use? a total of 12 such questions were asked in RTI
 gauratlab he ki free vaai faai dene kaa jimmaa sarkaar ke soochna takanic vibhaag ke paas he or isko nodel agency bhi banaaya gaya he
 Interestingly, on 25 June, Ashish Khaitan of the Delhi Dialogue Commission had announced that he would give wi fi in East Delhi by December and on 29 June the official reply comes that till now he has no information in this regard
 sarkaar ko apni yojana kii jaankaree nahinartiai main puche gaesavalon ke jawababehad chaunkaane vaale the
 The answers exposed the Kejriwal government's claims and preparations on free wi-fi
 vaai faai yojana ke bare main jawaab diya gaya ki yojana abhi taiyaar kii ja rahi he
 The Department of Information Technology is awaiting the government's proposal related to the scheme
 yani is jawaab se saaf he ki dedh saal baad bhi dilliwaalon ko chhodie khud dilli sarkaar ke paas free vaai faai kaa koi ata-pataa nahin hai
 Disappointment among the youth There is a lot of disappointment among the youth of Delhi due to non-fulfillment of the election promise of Fi

 raging kii yah ghatana pichley saal himachal pradesh ke tanda main hui thi jisamen choton ke chalate kanishtha chaatr aman kacharu kii maut ho gai thi
 Additional District and Sessions Judge Purinder Vaidya pleaded guilty to four counts of ragging under IPC 304 (2) culpable homicide not amounting to murder, 452 (unauthorized entry after preparing to harm) and 34 (common intention)
 Held

 At the same time, the right way of giving interviews can also give you a good job
 media reports ke mutbik, ek recruiting softwarecompanemen chif pipal officer rechal bite ne bataaya he ki aksar ummidavaar intervyuu dete vakt aisi dogaltiyankar dete hai, jis vajah se vah naukari kho dete hai
 She said that she had been a recruiter and HR executive at Apple and Inchuit
 jahaan unhone 6,000 se zyada logon kaa intervyuu liya
 Know what those mistakes are
 
 
 
 Anerechal Bite did not show softness that during the interview the behavior of the candidate is not soft
 unhone kaha ki phone intervyuu ke baad ek ummidavaar ko duusare round ke liye brakefast par bulaayaa
 But the way he behaved with the hotel staff, it became clear that he was a human being
 unhone kahana he ki jab bhi koi ummidavaar intervyuu dene aaen to vah narmi se pesh aaen
 You will not get a job due to your bad behavior, as well as your image can also be difficult
 sawaal naa puchhanounhone kaha ki aap ek nai company main naukari ke liye intervyuu dene ja rahe hai, or company se sambandhit koi sawaal nahin poochhate hai to iskaa bhi galat impresssont padataa he
 The recruiter feels that you are not serially concerned and do not know anything about the new company
 unka kahana he ki candidet jis bhi company main intervyuu dene ja rahe hai uske bare main research karke jaaen
 So that you can answer the questions related to the company from the recruiter
 ek cheez kaa hameshaa khyaal rakhen ki jab bhi aap koi atapata or logical sawaal poochhate hai to koi bhi aapako bevakoof nahin samajhegaa
 Yogi Adityanath's Vande Mataram's mantra in UP has many political meanings being extracted
 virodhiyon kaa aarope he ki ye bijepi ke bhagava agenda kaa hi ek aujaar he
 But after going through the history, it is known that the Congress avoided Vande Mataram
 aise maahaul main jab vande maataram gaanaa jaruri ho yaa nahin is par bahes chhidi he to ye jaananaa bhi behad ahm he ki vande maataram ko lekar mahatma gandhi kii kya soch thi
 What importance did Mahatma Gandhi give to Vande Mataram during a prayer meeting in Guwahati just before independence
 darasal jovande maatarmazadee kii ladaai main deshbhakti kaa power bank hua karata tha, vahi vande maataram aazaadee ke baad badale vakt main ek alag hi raajnneetik raag kaa pratik ban gaya
 Alam was that despite the provision of the national anthem to be accorded the honor and status of Vande Mataram in the constitution, the national anthem of the country got away from the Parliament of the country
 bijepi or shivasena jaisi partiyon ne jabavande maataramko apane tarkash kii tir banaaya, tab isaki baaki siyaasi vichaardhaaraon se duuri or bhi bad gai
 The color of politics changed so much that those who spoke of Hindu nationalism became Vande Mataram
 lekin baaki logon ke liye ise apnaanaa utana hi mushkil ho gaya
 On the other hand, the controversy that erupted during the freedom struggle did not stop Vande Mataram even after independence
 islam ishwar ke alaava kisi or ke saamne sir jhukaane kii manaahi jaisi baaten tab bhi thi or aaj bhi utani hi shiddat se saamne khadi hai
 Talking about the Ram Mandir and the Uniform Civil Code, when the BJP formed a government with a large majority in the biggest state of the country after a long time, the meaning of Vande Mataram became equally fierce in the eyes of the opponents
 kuch logon ko andeshaa he ki vande maataram ke jariye pradesh or desh kaa tanabana badalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 But against these political ways of Vande Mataram, voice has started coming from within BJP
 jaahir he ki mahatma gandhi ke vande maataram ke bol aaj bhi vahi hai
 But its meanings are changing with time and politics
 yadi aap yah maanate hai ki daulat se khushiyaan nahin kharidi ja saktin to aapako ek baar phir se sochane kii jarurat he kyonki ek nae adhyayan main daawa kiya gaya he ek had tak hi sahi lekin paise se khushiyaan kharidi jarur ja sakati hai
