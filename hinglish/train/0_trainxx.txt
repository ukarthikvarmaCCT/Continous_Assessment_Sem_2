 @beingsalmankhan@skfilmsofficial@tipsofficial@rameshtaurani@remodsouza During the crucial hearing in the Ayodhya Ram temple case, the Supreme Court refused to hear the hearing today
 court ne kaha ki is maamle main jald sunwaayee sambhav nahin he
 With this, the court has not set any next date for the next hearing
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki nikat bhavishya main is maamle main court main sunwaayee nahin hogi
 Earlier, on March 21, the court asked BJP leader and petitioner Subramanian Swamy in this case to tell on March 31 whether the two sides were ready to settle the issue by mutual agreement
 pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne donon pakshon se kaha tha ki agar is maamle ko baatcheet se suljhaayaa jaae to behatar hoga
 Not only this, while hearing the case, Chief Justice had said that if both the parties feel that they are ready to mediate themselves and if the negotiations do not resolve, then the Supreme Court is ready for hearing
 21 march ko pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish justise khehar ne kaha ye maamla dharm or aasthaa se judaa hua he or donon paksh aapas main baith or baatcheet ke jariye hal nikaalane kii koshish karen
 Chief Justice Justice Khehar said that if both parties feel they are ready to mediate themselves
 court ne kaha ki agar paksh chaahe to is maamle main court kisi ko madhyasth niyukt kar saktaa he
 The court had then told BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to re-hear the case on March 31
 tippaniyan In fact, Subramanian Swamy had said in the Supreme Court that the Ram temple dispute case is pending in the Supreme Court for the last 6 years
 is maamle main supreme court ko rojaanaa sunwaayee kar jald faisla sunaanaa chahie
 Here, the Sunni Waqf Board, a lawyer for the son of Babri Masjid advocate Mohammad Haasim, has written a letter to the Registrar of the Supreme Court raising questions about Subramanian Swamy's role
 chitthee main kaha gaya he ki swami ne jald sunwaayee kii maang kii thi lekin is maamle main wo pakshakaar nahin hai, balki unhone hastkshep yachika daali he
 But the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to accept his petition or not
 chitthee main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki swami pakshakaron ke vakeelon ko bhi sunwaayee se judi jaankaree nahin dete
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had told both the parties that it would be better if the matter is resolved by negotiation
 sirf itnaa hi nahin maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue cheef justise ne kaha tha ki agar donon pakshon ko lagata he to wo khud madhyasthata karaane ke liye taiyaar hai or agar baatcheet se hal nahin nikalataa he to phir supreme court sunwaayee ko taiyaar he
 In the last hearing on March 21, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Justice Khehar said that this matter is related to religion and faith and both sides should sit together and try to find a solution through dialogue
 mukhya nyaayadhish justise khehar ne kaha agar donon paksho ko lagata he to wo khud madhyakshata karaane ke kiye taiyaar hai
 The court said that if the party wishes, the court can appoint a mediator in this matter
 court ne tab bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ko kaha tha ki wo 31 march ko maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye phir se mension kare
 The comments darasal subramanyam swami ne supreme court main kaha tha ki ram mandir vivaad kaa maamla pichley 6 saal se supreme court main lambit he
 In this case, the Supreme Court should hear every day and give its verdict soon
 idhar babari masjid ke pairokaar mohammad haasim ke bete ke vakil or sunni vaqf board ne supreme court ke register ko chitti likhakar subrahmanyam swami kii bhoomika ko lekar sawaal uthaae hai
 The letter states that Swamy had demanded an early hearing but he is not a party to the matter, but has filed an intervention petition
 lekin supreme court ne ab tak ye tay nahin kiya he ki unki yachika ko sweekaar kiya jaae yaa nahin
 It has also been said in the letter that Swami does not give information related to the hearing to the lawyers of the parties
 21 march ko pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish justise khehar ne kaha ye maamla dharm or aasthaa se judaa hua he or donon paksh aapas main baith or baatcheet ke jariye hal nikaalane kii koshish karen

 purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur kii patni sunanda pushkar kii maut ke nau maheene baad ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki unki jaan jehar ne lee thi
 a team of three doctors from the forensic department of AIIMS, after examining Visara i
e
 Sunanda's stomach pouch, found that there were some pieces of poison in the stomach
 par ye jehar kya tha, kis tarah kaa tha, sunanda ne khud ise khaaya yaa use khilaayaa gaya in sab sawaalon ke jawaab philhal nadaarad hai
 That is, the question of whose poison killed Sunanda still remains a question
 sunanda pushkar kii maut naa to beemaari kii vajah se hui, naa unhen dil kaa daura padaa tha or naa hi dawa ke orvadoj ne unki jaan lee
 So did this new revelation solve the mystery of Sunanda's death? off course not! Because doctors have just given the reason for death
 ye nahin bataaya he ki jis jehar ne jaan lee wo jehar koun sa tha? wo jehar kisi chemical ghalemal kaa nateeja tha yaa phir sajeesh ke tahat hi us jehar ko sunanda ke pet tak pahanchaya gaya
 And the biggest question is whether the poison was taken by Sunanda himself with the intention of committing suicide, or by someone with the intention of killing him, that poison? Is due to darasal 17 janvari ko sunanda kii laash jis paanch sitara hotel ke kamare se mili thi, vahaan laash ke saath alprex kii goliyon ke do khaali pattey mili the
 There were a total of thirty tablets in both leaves
 magar ab visra report aane ke baad pataa chalaa ki sunanda ne marane se pehle alprex kii ek bhi goli nahin khai thi
 That is, there was no death from drug overdose
 isi ke baad ames ke teen doctoron kii team ne visra report kii dobaaraa jaanch kii to pataa chalaa ki sunanda ke pet main jehar ke kuch ansh the or yahi jehar maut kii vajah bana
 In the report given by the three doctors of the forensic department of AIIMS, it has been written that Sunanda's viscera, ie, the stomach bag contains ethyl, alcohol, caffeine, acetamenophen, cotinine
 par inamen se kis jehar yaa chemical ne sunanda kii jaan lee, modical board is bare main khamosh he
 Doctors say that there are a lot of restrictions in the viscera report, so nothing can be said about the type of poison
 ames medical board ne visra report 27 sitambar ko taiyaar kii thi or 30 sitambar ko ise dilli police ko saunp diya
 Although the report does not mention the type of poison, but after taking the name of six types of poison, it has been said in the report that forensic lab is difficult to investigate
 visra report to aa gai, maut kii vajah bhi bataa di gai
 But then the same question whether this will solve the mystery of Sunanda? Even though the medical board did not mention the type of poison, it could not ascertain whether the poison was eaten or fed by Sunanda himself with the intention of committing suicide
 magar usne delli police se 13 sawaalon ke jawaab jarur maange hai
 The Modal Board says that if the answers to these 13 questions are found, then it will be easy to give the last medical opinion
 sunanda ko kiske jehar ne maaraa is sawaal kaa jawaab beshak doctoron kii team nahin de pai
 But those same doctors have put the Delhi Police in the dock for investigating this case
 forensik exparts kaa kahana he ki maut kii vajah bani jehar kaa bhi pataa chal jaataa, agar dilli police medical board ko puri jaanch report detii
 The medical board has also mentioned several policemen in its investigation report
 dilli police kamishnar kaa kahana he ki medical report ab bhi adhuri he or jab tak khud police kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch jaati aage kii karrwai nahin mushkil he
 But the Modal Board says that there were many things related to the investigation which even after nine months the Delhi Police did not give it to the Medical Board despite the demand
 ab apni report ke saath medical board ne ek baar phir dilli police se 13 sawaalon ke jawaab maangen he
 The Medical Board asked the Delhi Police to answer 13 questions
 krime seen kii tasviren board ko kyon nahin muhaiyaa karai gayi?2
 Why were the statements and circumstantial evidence of the people not given? 3
 laash ke saath kamare se kuch davaaiyaan mili thim
 Who wrote these medicines? Where were you purchased from? And who were these medicines for? 4
 sunanda pushkar ke ilaaj kii parchi main kahin bhi alprex kaa zikr nahin tha
 Then how was Alprax found in the room? 5
 15-15 tablet kii alprex ke do khaali pattey kamare se mili, jabaki visra report se pataa chalata he ki unhone alprex khai hi nahin
 6
 sunanda ne sote hue relex rest sleep company kaa ek begni rang kaa top or mark and spencer kaa loar pahana hua tha
 There were six spots of light white stain on their tops, which may be of acetaminophen, caffeine, lidocaine, and methanol paraben
 ye paristhitijanya sakshya hai jinaki or jaanch kii jaani chahie
 7
 kya sunanda kaa koi kareebi alprex khaataa he?8
 Did Sunanda seek any medical help at the hotel before her death? 9
 maut ke baad sabase pehle jis doctor ne sunanda ko dekha uskaa bayaan kahaan he?10
 His body smelled of mild filthy gas and a wound in his left eye
 iske bare main ye pataa lagaana chahie ki wo pehle se maujuud tha, jab unhen aakhri baar jinda dekha gaya tha
 11
 wo email kahaan he jo 26 janvari ko doctor rajeev bhasin ne bheja tha?12
 After Sunanda's death, the mail from Doctor Anil Gupta sent from Dubai on January 26, where his illness is mentioned, is where he is
 taaki usase unki beemaari or maut kii vajah pataa kiya ja sake
 13
 jis bed shit or gadde par sunanda kii laash mili, uski forensik jaanch kyon nahin karai gai?medical board ne apni jaanch report main ye sansanikhej khulaasa bhi kiya he ki maut se pehle sunanda bilkul tandoorust thim
 That is, she was not a victim of any disease
 unka dil, liver sab kuch thik tha
 Whereas after Sunanda's death it was constantly being said that she was extremely ill
 jaanch report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki sunanda ke sharir par chot ke jo nishaan mili the, uske bare main bhi dilli police ne board ko koi jaankaree yaa jaanch report nahin di

 But in order to win the political battle, Rahul Gandhi has decided to come up with a new strategy
 june main kaaryakartaaon se milenge rahulsutron ke mutabik, june maheene main rahul karnataka rajya ke kaaryakartaaon se milenge
 After this a big program will be organized in the state in the month of July
 is kaarykram main har block ke adhyaksh or ek booth sanyojak ko nyotaa diya jayega
 If sources are to be believed, Rahul will address about 80,000 workers in this way
 sanghathan kii majbootee par dhyaan denge rahulisi ke saath karnataka main congress apana prachaar abhiyaan shuru karegi
 The matter is simple, we will focus on the strength of Kirahul Sangathan
 kaaryakartaaon se rishta majboot karenge, lekin rajya ke siyaasi chunaav main modi se takaraane kii bajaay rajya ke bijepi netritv se rajya kaa congress netritv takaraayega
 Under this strategy, Rahul will play a role in booth management, but the political math will be to confront the state BJP unit instead of hitting Modi
 modi banaam rahul nahin hogi siyaasi ladaayeetay he ki karnataka ke 80 hajaar party kaaryakartaaon se milakar rahulparty sanghathan mempani pakad majboot karenge
 Rahul will not be at the center in the state in this political battle
 kul milakar ab congress chunaav ko rahul banaam modi karne kii bajaay rajya bijepi netritv banaam rajya congress netritv karne ko taiyaar he

 lekin piem modi ne suraksha gheraa todate hue unase haath milaayaa
 After this, the reporters asked Modi, 'when are you coming to Pakistan?' Without answering this question, Modi smiled and proceeded from there
 isse pehle saarc sammelan ke sampann hone par modi ne pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif se kaaphi der tak haath milaayaa
 After the conclusion of the SAARC conference, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that Prime Minister Modi's first SAARC committee was a success
 emie pravaktaa akbaruddin ne kaha, 'saarc sammelan ke dauraan maahaul bahut acha rahaa
 We are very satisfied with this
 saarc sirf bharat or pakistan ke bare main nahin he
 He said, "india wants a smooth and peaceful relationship with Pakistan
" ham sarthak baatcheet karne ke icchhuk hai

 ' maharashtra cese par supreme court main sunwaayee kal somvaar tak ke liye tal gai he
 The petition filed jointly by the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress was strongly argued by the complainant during the hearing in the country's largest court
 kapil sibbal ne court se kaha ki rajyapal centre ke sidhe nirdesh par kaam kar rahe hai
 Recommendation for the end of President's rule, cabinet meeting and the time line for when the President's signature was signed
 court ne sarkaar gathan se judi puri prakriya ke paper ko lekar aane ko kaha he
 As soon as the hearing started in the Supreme Court, advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Shiv Sena, first apologized to the court for conducting the hearing on Sunday, on which the court said that it is our duty to protect the Constitution
 kapil sibbal shivasena kii ore se court main daleel rakh rahe hai to abhishek manu singhvi congress kii ore se pesh ho rahe hai
 Kapil Sibal - Election results were declared on 24 October
 sadan main bahumat ke liye 145 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie
 Nothing happened between October 24 and November 9
 is dauraan rajyapal ne kisi ko sarkaar banane ke liye nahin bulaayaa
 Kapil Sibal - then called the BJP on 9 November, but refused to form the government
 10 november ko shivasena ko bulaayaa lekin use 24 ghante kaa hi samay diya gaya
 Other parties were subsequently moved to President's Rule in the afternoon on 12 November
 ise bhi padhein---ncp kaa nayaa daanv, rajbhavan ko saunpi MLA kii list, ajit pavaar kaa bhi naam shamilakapil sibbal-chunaav purv gathbandhan (bijepi-shivasena) tut gaya or chunaav baad nayaa gathbandhan banaaya gaya
 At 7 pm on 22 November, a PC announced that we, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have agreed to form the government together and will stake claim to form the government
 lekin jis tarah faisla liya gaya wo anokhaa he or maine is tarah kaa faisla ab tak nahin dekha
 In the morning, the Governor recommended abolition of President's rule and President's rule was abolished
 lekin is dauraan koi cabinet baithak nahin hui
 Then at 8 am, 2 people were also administered the oath
 jo kuch bhi hua wo sab kuch rahasyamayi he
 When were the proposals made and how was the invitation given
 is par kuch bhi saaf nahin he
 Kapil Sibal - If they believe that majority is with them, then prove the majority in the House at the earliest
 supreme court ne is dauraan saare dastavejon kii baat poochi to kaha ki kuch bhi record par nahin he, lekin shaam 7 baje se subah 7 baje ke bich yah sab kuch hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 It is interesting that President's rule was lifted at 5:47 am on Saturday
 or is faisle ke mahaj 3 ghante ke andar devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar ko shapath dilaa di gai
 Justice Sanjeev Khanna - When was the letter of support given? Kapil Sibal: Nothing on record
 aadhi raat ke baad hi sab kuch hua lagata he
 Mukul Rohatgi- i want to raise one aspect of the case
 cese karne waalon ko dekhie
 Representatives from Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress were sent
 kya yah sahi he
 The petitioner has come to the Supreme Court under Article 32
 lekin kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke paas koi moulik adhikaar nahin hota
 They should first go to the High Court
 pehle ke die gaye aadesh vyaktigat taur par di gai yachika par aadhaarit the
 Not to be proved on behalf of majority parties
 justise khanna- in takneekee aapattiyon ko badla ja saktaa he
 They can add parties by verbal mentioning
 vidambnaa yah he ki yah mudda karnataka main kapil sibbal kii ore se uthaaya gaya tha
 Now he is on the other side
 mukul rohtagi-main bijepi ke ek or kuch nirdaleey ummidavaaron kii ore se court main pesh ho rahaa hum
 There was no need to hear on Sunday
 kisi pakshakaar ko kuch tathy maaloom nahin to aaj hi sunwaayee karne kii kya jarurat thi
 Justice Ramanna and Justice Khanna - Now the bench has become and we have started hearing, so this question has no meaning
 court ne kapil sibbal se poocha koi or daleel? to unhone karnataka ke maamla kaa udhaaharan liya
 Kapil Sibal - All these orders are consistent that there should be a floor test
 maharashtra ke logon ko ek sarkaar kii darkaar he
 They are not conducting floor tests because they want to do something different in the meantime
 shaam 7 baje hamane daawa kiya ki ham sarkaar banaaenge
 The circumstances in the state are exactly opposite to their letter of support
 ham abhi bhi bahumat sabit kar sakate hai
 There is a set procedure for the formation of Abhishek Manu singhvi-sarkar
 rajyapal kii bhoomika hoti he ki pehle vah hastakshar or bhautik dastavejon ke madhyam se khud ko santusht kare
 Physical verification of legislators should be done
 - jab shaam 7 baje hamane elaan kiya ki ham sarkaar banane ja rahe hai to aadhi raat ko rajyapal ne aisa faisla kaise le liya
 Did they get any verification done before the verdict? - What is the basis of swearing in of CM and Deputy CM? Ajit Pawar claimed that my mlas have come with me
 - kal ensipi ne ek baithak kii thi jisamen 41 vidhayak maujuud hue
 In this meeting, when 41 mlas decided to remove Ajit Pawar from the post of Legislature Party leader, how are they claiming that they have the support? - These questions would not have arisen if the Governor had followed the procedure
 mukhyamantri or upmukhyamantri pad ke shapath grahan ke peeche ensipi ke bich hua matbhed he
 Justice Ramanna- We are not sitting here listening to the internal issue of the party
 hamen isse koi lenaa dena nahin
 Mukul Rohatgi - What the BJP did with the Governor was the killing of democracy because that letter of support was only signed by 43 mlas
 sirf sadan main bahumat siddh karnaa hi sabase upyukt or vishwasaneey upaay he
 In the judgment given in the Mukul rohatgi-bommai case, it is also said that the best way to take a decision is the floor test
 anya faisle bhi 24 ghante kaa samay dete hai
 Justice Ramanna - It is clear
 bommai faisle main koi vivaad nahin he
 Singhvi - This idea is to stop horse trading
 centre kii ore se solicytor general tushaar mehta pesh hue
 The Tushar Mehta-coalition does not have the fundamental right to form the government, their petition cannot be allowed
 abhishek manu singhvi-mere paas jharkhand, uttarakhand, goa, karnataka or anya rajyon main hui aisi hi ghatnaon main vakaalat kaa anubhav he
 Singhvi made some suggestions to the court during this time that such time management could be done
 somvaar subah protem spikar ke rup main sabase senior vidhayak ko chun liya jaae
 From 11 am to 4 pm the oath of legislators should be fulfilled
 iske baad satr aahut kar floor test karaayaa ja saktaa he
 The singhvi-karnataka case clearly states that voting should not be held by secret ballot
 khule rup se matdaan hona chahie or puri prakriya kaa sidhaa prasaaran bhi hona chahie
 a similar floor test was conducted in Goa case
 SG tushaar mehta-karnataka maamle main main rajyapal ke liye upasthit hua tha
 We had presented all the papers
 abhishek manusinghvi- uttarakhand cese main bhi vot karaayaa gaya tha or sidhaa prasaaran hua tha
 SG Tushar mehta-he can present documents on behalf of the Governor
 singhvi- shapath grahan ke saath-saath yaa thik baad sadan main prastaav ke samarthak or virodh karne vaale sadasyon ko alag-alag taraf bitha sakate hai, yaa phir voting karai jaae
 Sibal: The ruling party has been given time till November 30 to prove its majority on behalf of the Governor, this means something is falling apart
 court aaj yaa kal floor test karaane kaa aadesh de saktaa he
 Many of these were not cases where i am producing the letters of mlas
 yahaan ek dipti siem he, jiske paas koi samarthan nahin he
 This is a blatant violation of democracy because democracy runs on numbers
 rajyapal ko unhen aamantrit nahin karnaa chahie tha
 singhvi-composite floor test should be done
 samarthan patr par 41 vidhayakon ke dastakhat hai, lekin upmukhyamantri ajit pavaar apane samarthan main ensipi ke 51 vidhayakon kaa daawa karte rahe
 The court can order a floor test today or tomorrow or when the facility is there
 mukul rohtagi-samvidhan ke anuchhe 360 or 361 main rashtrpati or rajyapal ke adhikaron kaa vistaar se ullekh he
 Under 361, the Governor is not accountable before any court for the work done under his jurisdiction
 rajyapal ko adhikaar he ki wo kisko mukhyamantri ke rup main chune
 Justice Ramanna- The Governor cannot make such an appointment, but it cannot be questioned
 sab pehle se nirdhaarit he
 The decision should be made by floor test
 justise ramanna- har cheez ke liye kanoon nirdhaarit he
 The rule is set
 rohtagi- ab sawaal he ki court kya kare or kya kar saktaa he
 Justice Bhushan - We do not even know whether and under what process all this happened? Rohatgi - That is why we are saying that what was needed to disturb people on Sunday by making people so fast? Rohatgi - tomorrow For the Protem Speaker's oath, the oath to the legislators and then the Governor's brief speech and then the test
 rohtagi-sadan court kaa or court sadan kaa sammaan karata he
 This is the truth
 nahin to kahin sadan kal ko paas kar de ki supreme court do saal main saare maamle nipataae
 Justice Ramanna - Is anyone presenting on behalf of the state government? fadanvis yaa ajit pavaar kii ore se
 Sibal- We have presented copies of the petition to everyone
 ham aashwast hai
 Those people did not attend
 tushaar mehta- main centre kii ore se pesh hua
 i was not briefed by anyone
 jarurat hui to maharashtra ke liye bhi jawaab daakhil kar saktaa hum
 The Supreme Court issued notice to all the defendants
 ab is sambandh main kal saadhe 10 baje sunwaayee hogi
 Copies should be given to all parties
 court ne governor kaa aadesh or samarthan patr kal subah tak talab kiya
 It has also been asked to bring the order of the Governor tomorrow morning and the order of the letter sent by Fadnavis
 saath hi centre, maharashtra, devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar ko notice jari kiya gaya he
 The craze of online shopping has increased rapidly over the last few years
 aap bhi karat honge online shopping
 There is more shopping due to offers and discounts
 lekin aapako mod of pement ke taur par kya istemaal karnaa chahie? cash on delivery? yaa card? agar aapkaa jawaab debit card he to shaayad aapako debit card se shopping karne se bachanaa chahie
 Buying any goods by giving debit card details on the internet is not free from danger
 online shopping sef he or ye ofline pement se bhi surakshit he
 Not using a debit card for online shopping is actually your way of protection
 kai sari pareshaaniyon se batch sakate hai
 If something goes wrong, you can avoid it
 online pement ke liye debit card kaa yuj na karne kii do vajahe hai
 Online transactions in India require a password or PIN with a card number
 pehali vajahdebit or credit cards se shopping karne se i-tranjaction yuj hota he, lekin ek bada fark he
 There is a limit on credit cards, so you cannot spend much
 lekin debit card kii koi limit nahin hoti he
 You can shop as much money as you have in your account
 duusare shabdon main kahen to debit card agar hack hua to aksar aap online frod kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 It is possible that all your money can go as much as you have in your bank account
 agar credit card frod hota he to jitani credit limit he utane hi paise jaaenge
 The second reason is that the limit given in credit card is not your money
 aap credit card se shopping karte hai to aap bank kaa paisa yuj kar rahe hai jo phir aapke upar karj ban jaataa he jise baad main bank ko chukaana hota he
 The bank charges interest for this and for some time it is free
 ye frod se protection kaa bhi kaam karata he
 If anyone has even made a dent in the credit card, then it is the responsibility of the bank to protect it from fraud
 aap bank ko ye explene kar sakate hai ki credit card kaa kisi ne galat yuj kiya he or aap iske liye jimmedaar nahin hai
 In most cases, the bank investigates the transaction itself and if they understand that you are telling the truth, then the fraudulent money is not asked from you which is good for you
 agar aapke saath debit card frod hota he to aap bank ko bataa sakate hai ki aapke card kaa galat istemaal kiya gaya he, ye bhi sambhav he ki aapako wo paise bhi waapas mil jaaen, lekin credit or debit card ke frod main fark ye he ki agar debit card frod hua to pehle aapke paise chale jaaenge or phir agar bank aapke daawey ko sach maneka to waapas milenge
 But in the case of credit cards, your money does not go, unless a bank later refuses to believe that a fraud has happened to you
 iske baad aapse paise chukaane ko kahe jaaenge
 However, you can still challenge it
 saadhaaran shabdon main kahen to agar aap debit card yuj karke paise spend kar rahe hai to aapke cash kaa tatkaal nuksaan hota he
 Money is immediately deducted from the bank, the credit card works differently
 yahaan tranjaction or pement karne ke bich aapke paas samay hota he, jo aamtaur par credit card ke billing saaikal kaa aakhri time hota he
 Taking a dig at Rahul, PM Modi said that the young leader said very well that how can PM Modi talk about online banking in a country where 60 percent people are illiterate
 kya maine koi jaadu tona kiya he jo koi anpadh ho gaya
 They are not even understanding what they are doing
 anpadh janata kiski dein he, lekin kisi kaa kalaadhan khul rahaa he to kisi kaa kaala man khul rahaa he
 i am working with the belief that the country will become clean and go clean like gold

 pichley kai hafton se dilli ke alag-alag bazaaron main dukaanon ko sil karne kaa silsilaa jari he
 Officers of the Monitoring Committee and MCD are also continuously taking action after the Supreme Court order
 is bich mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne uparajyapal anil baijal ko aisa formula bataaya he jo dilli ke kaarobaariyon ko ceiling se raahat dilaa saktaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal wrote a letter to LG Anil Baijal on January 25, a few days before the Aam Aadmi Party and BJP uproar
 kejariwal kaa daawa he ki in 4 baton ko agaruparajyapal amal main laate hai, to vyapaariyon ko ceiling se raahat mil sakati he
 The Chief Minister claims that making this change only comes under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor

 2

 3

 4
 kanvarjan charge par let fees ko puri tarah se maaf kiya jaae
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also given the reason for waiving conversion charge
 kejariwal kaa kahana he, 'vyapaariyon ne pichley kaafii samay tak emsidi ko kanvarjan charge jamaa karaayaa he or emsidi ne 3 hazaar karod rupye kakanvarjan charge ikaitha kiyatha

 'siem arvind kejariwal ke mutabik jin market se kanvarjan charge ikattha kiya tha, wo sara paisa unheen market ke vikaas par karch hona tha lekin emsidi ne aisa nahin kiya
 Therefore, now all conversion charges and fines of traders should be waived

 The BJP feels that one ideology can run the whole country, but the truth is that this country is not made up of just one thought or ideology but thousands and millions of ideas
 rahul ne kaha ki congress 70 karod bharatiyon kii jaruraton par dhyaan kendrit karegi, jo philhal madhya varg ke str se neeche hai or unke vikaas evam samruddhi ke liye kaam karegi

 The Supreme Court clearly stated that there will be no investigation in this case, there is no basis in the case
 court ne kaha ki is maamle ke jariye nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 What is the whole matter? Let me tell you that Justice Loya was hearing the famous Sohrabuddin Sheikh case

 Tulsiram, a witness of the Sohrabuddin encounter, was also killed

 The Supreme Court had transferred the trial related to the resentment case expressed by Amit Shah for not presenting

 Since then, this matter came under discussion again

 Judge Loya's son had held a press conference, however, Judge Loyake's son Anuj Loya had expressed his displeasure over the issue being raised a few days ago by holding a press conference
 anuj ne kaha tha ki unke pita kii maut prakritik thi, vah is masale ko badhanaa dene nahin chaahate hai
 Four judges had held a press conference and it is worth mentioning that recently four Supreme Court justices held a press conference for the first time revolting against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 is dauraan in nyaayamurtiyon ne khule taur par jaj loya ke cese kii sunwaayee ko lekar aapatti uthaai thi
 These judges also complain that the Chief Justice listens to all the important cases themselves, that is, they take advantage of being the Master of Roster

 In response to a question asked on this issue, Amit Shah said that Caravan magazine has published the news about the death of Justice Loya, on the other hand an English newspaper has also published the news

 The session of the 17th Lok Sabha started on Monday and new members took oath as well, but the MP whose oath caught everyone's attention was BJP MP from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur
 ji haa, vahi sadhvi pragna singh thakur jinhone mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko deshbhakt kaha tha
 This statement sparked controversy across the country
 vivaad itnaa gaharaaya ki piem modi tak ko saamne aana padaa or unhone chunaav prachaar ke antim din apni antim raily main kaha ki godse par die bayaan ke baad wo sadhvi ko kabhi maaf nahin karenge
 National President Amit Shah had referred the matter to the Disciplinary Committee, but it seems that after the end of the election, the BJP, celebrating an overwhelming majority, has put the matter on hold
 gauratlab he ki amit shah ne 17 may ko godse par die sadhvi pragna ke bayaan ko gambhir maanate hue ise anushaasan samiti ko saunpa tha or 10 din main isaki report aane kii baat kahi thi, lekin maheenaa bhar biit jane ke baad bhi naa to is maamle main koi report ai or naa hi isaki ab koi ummid dikhti he
 Even though the report of the Disciplinary Committee did not come even after the month had passed, Aaj Tak spoke to Satyadev Singh, a member of the BJP Discipline Committee
 satyadev singh ne kaha ki is maamle main wo kuch bhi nahin bataa sakate
 Not only this, when he was asked whether he had come to know about the statement made by Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur on Godse or not, Satyadev Singh said that only General Secretary Ramlal will be able to tell anything in this matter, because all the matters related to the organization Let's see the same
 satyadev singh ne kaha ki raamalaal ji hi tay karenge ki sadhvi pragna singh thakur par karrwai kerani he yaa unhen maaf karnaa he
 Now the question arises whether in view of the final phase of elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pretended to send the matter to the Disciplinary Committee to calm the anger of the people? Because when the Discipline Committee is not aware of the matter, then the big question is, who will take action? On the other hand, Sadhvi Pragya has already said that she has given her answer to the Disciplinary Committee

 The Congress also alleged that Rajiv Mehrishi, as the Finance Secretary, was also a part of the negotiations in May 2015 at the price of 36 Rafale deal
 congress kaa aarope he ki ucchtam str par hui kathith gadabadiyon or bhrashtachar main unka bhi haath tha
 In such a situation, he himself cannot investigate the deal in which he himself was a partner
 supreme court tak main sieji kii report ke bare main bhram paidaa hone par bhi wo chup rahe or modi sarkaar ko jhooth failaane se rokane kii koshish nahin kii
 The chairman of the negotiating team that finalized the Rafale deal said this on the claims of the leaked note
 The Congress has given a memorandum to the CAG, saying that it is your responsibility as a CAG to submit a report to the PAC investigating the Rafale deal
 ham aapse guzarish karte hai ki aap apane aap ko is jaanch se alag kiijie or saarvajanik taur par apni galati sweekaar kiijie

 We told them about the scam
 hamane unhen bataaya ki qaraar kii jaanch honi chahie kyonki yah bhrasht tareeke se hua
 But how can he conduct an inquiry against himself? "the Congress said - PM or PMO were acting as middlemen in the Rafale deal! He said that in the arguments presented by the Congress to the CAG, the Congress had said that in the Rafale deal There have been irregularities and corruption in this
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘‘nishchit taur par vah vitt sachiv ke taur par liye gaye faislon kii jaanch nahin kar sakate
 He will save himself first and then his government

 Before the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the exit poll has made it clear that this time again the Modi government
 haalanki, final nattejey 23 may ko aane hai
 Meanwhile, another figure has emerged today
 darasal, ajtak ne pehali baar anokhaa prayaas karte hue janata ko i-voting kaa mauka diya tha
 The people of the country have participated extensively in this and the Modi tsunami is also visible in the results of this e-election
 i-chunaav main bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ko 326 siten mil rahi hai, jabaki congress va uske sahyogi dalon ko 112 siten mili hai
 On the other hand, e-voters have given 105 seats
 yani narendra modi ke netritv main endie phir se sarkaar banaata dikh rahaa he
 This figure of e-election till date is almost like exit poll
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole main endie ko 339-365 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Whereas in the e-election of Aaj Tak, the public has given 326 seats to the NDA, which is much more than the absolute majority
 yani agsit pole ke anumaan par i-chunaav bhi muhar laga rahaa he
 Let me tell you that for the first time in the online era, Aaj Tak had given the people of India the opportunity to vote through the Internet
 ye wo mauka tha jisamen aap kisi bhi loksabhaa seat par apni manapsand raajnneetik party ke liye vot kar paae

 3 BJP supporters did not cast their vote
 The BJP had a figure of 328 mps in the House and 325 votes were cast in their favor
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki wo teen saansad koun hai jinhone vot nahin diya
 However, it has not been detected yet

 Hearing on the bail of Asaram accused of rape in Jodhpur central jail has been postponed
 ab sunwaayee 13 janvari ko hogi
 Asaram's lawyer Ram Jethmalani made a big effort to argue the bail plea, but the court did not hear one and postponed the hearing
 asaram kii ore se jaipur hoicourt main jamaanat ke liye yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Disappointment spread after the news of supporters of Asaram standing outside the Central Jail in Jaipur and Jodhpur in Jaipur
 court ne jethmalani se kaha, jaldbaaji na karendalat main asaram kii jamaanat par bahes ke liye qamar kasakar pahunche vakil ram jethmalani chaahate the ki maamle par aaj hi bahes ho or asaram ko bel mil jaae
 But the public prosecutor said to postpone the debate and give another date, which was accepted by the court
 jethmalani ke baar-baar kehane par court ne kaha ki itani jaldi kya he? abhi kuch din pehle hi to asaram kii jamaanat yachika khaarij hui thi
 More cases are yet to be heard in the court, so do not rush

 Asaram, who was arrested in the charge of exploitation of Asaramayun, trapped badly in 14 streams, has been wrapped by the Jodhpur police in 14 streams that it is now difficult for Asaram to breathe in the open air
 balaatkaar se lekar bal yon utpeedan or yahaan tak ki bal taskari kii sangeen dhaaraon main ghire asaram ke tamaam jurmon ke bahi-khate kaa hisaab-kitaab isi mukademe se hoga
 The supporters of Asaram on social media have insisted that Asaram's supporters in jail had become quite active on social media since Sunday to get him bail

 In fact, supporters have demanded that Asaram be given justice and that he be granted bail on 7 January
 iske alaava zyaadaatar samarthakon kaa aarope he ki media ne asaram ko badnaam karne ke liye jhuthe aarope ko tool diya
 This was not the first time that Asaram supporters have raised their voice on Twitter in this manner
 isse pehle pichley saal disambar maheene main bhi # whysobiased? or bapuji hashtag ke jariye asaram ke bhakton ne unke samarthan main twit kiye the

 Suresh Prabhu, the second railway minister in the Modi government, presented his first railway budget
 itihaas main pehali baar hua he jab kisi nai train kaa elaan nahin hua
 Passenger fares have also not increased
 isaki jaankaree railmantri ne shuru main hi de di
 Often the Railway Minister saved this announcement for the end, so that interest in the budget speech would remain
 magar prabhu ji ne to puri film kii story pehle bataa di
 Some films also start like this
 prabhu aapaki rail ko tej kar dena chaahate hai
 The speed of trains is being increased in 9 rail corridors
 isamen gaadi kii raftaar 110-130 kimi prati ghante kii jagah 160 se 200 kimi prati ghante hogi
 So that the journey between Delhi Kolkata and Delhi Mumbai can be completed in one night
 yani bullate train to abhi sample ke rup main aegi agar aa gai to, magar maujuuda railgadiyaan 200 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se chalane lagengi yah soch kar hi aap dilli se patna 13 kii bajaae 7 ghante main pahunchane kaa sapana dekh sakate hai
 There is not much emphasis on bullet train
 chote se paragraph main nipta diya gaya he yani prabhu ne apni praathamikta bataa di he
 other than this pichley saal june main hi yatri haada main 14
 There was an increase of 5 percent
 deazal ke daam kam hone ke baad bhi kuch chizon kaa maal haada badhaayaa gaya he
 Like urea freight will increase by 10%, cement by 6
 3% or lohe steel main ek fisadi se kuch kam
 Fertilizer Minister Anant Kumar has said that we will increase the subsidy for the price of urea which will increase
 rail bajet taiyaar karte vaqt suresh prabhu ne mote taur par chaar lakshya rakhe hai
 These are the methods that Railways will adopt to achieve these goals
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha he ki main is baat se zyada khush hum ki pehali baar railway ko takniki rup se behatar or aadhunik banane ke liye thos nazariyaa saamne aayaa he
 The railway budget of 2015 marked the beginning of reforms in railways
 abhi tak gadiyon or coach kii sankhya par hi baat hoti thi
 The budget of the railway has now increased to Rs 1 lakh 11 crore, which was 65 thousand 798 crore
 to paisa kahaan se aayega iske liye raste ye hai
 Railways need 27 times the money to double, triple the track with electrification
 paanch saal ke liye railway kaa anumaanit bajet saadhe aath lakh karod rakhaa gaya he
 The Congress has said that Mumbai is only about Delhi and Kolkata
 puure desh kii nahin
 Nitish Kumar has said that there is no clarity about PPP mode
 ek sawaal saansad nidhi ko lekar uth rahaa he
 The Railway Minister has said that mps should spend some of their funds to improve railway stations
 ek saansad ko har saal paanch karod kii raashi sthaneey vikaas ke liye milti he
 From MP funds, Corporate Social Responsibility Funds to Pension Funds and in partnership plans with states and also sharing the expenses, will Prabhu Agale raise Rs 8
5 lakh crore for five years
 ek uttar ho saktaa he ki nahin juta paaenge, lekin agar yah nahin ho saktaa he to phir koun sa rasta bachaa he jiske bare main prabhu ne nahin sochaa kya aalochak aapako bataa rahe hai
 Suresh Prabhu has emphasized that this is a five-year road map
 vishwa bank jaise sanghathanon se nivesh aayega
 Do not know how will come and on what conditions
 aisa nahin ki pehle nahin aayaa
 Prabhu claims that if we improve the consumer services, the passenger's trust in the rail will increase and he will be able to pay more
 prabhu kaa lakshya he ki rail ko har din do karod yatriyon kii jagah teen karod yatriyon ko dhonaa hoga
 Obviously, coaches have to be increased for the number of passengers
 gadiyon kii sankhya badhaani hogi
 Then there will be talk of car and coach
 is bajet main prabhu ne kaha he ki upree berth par chadhane vaali sidhiyon kii dizine main badlaav karenge
 Talking to NIFT for bed design
 bajet ko padhakar laga ki samasyaon par prabhu kii nazar to gai he, ho saktaa he ki unka rasta mukammal na ho lekin kya prabhu ne yah kehane kaa saahas nahin dikhaaya he ki railway garib he
 He needs investment
 kya railway ke nijeekaran kaa koi gupt daravaaza khulne ja rahaa he? kya prabhu ne yah kaha ki nijeekaran ke alaava koi rasta nahin? pradhanmantri ne varanasi main to kaha tha ki ve kabhi nijeekaran nahin karenge

 Be sure to consult your doctor to get rid of regular periods and stress
 achaanak biimaar hona jaise bukhaar, cold, kaph yaa phir lambe samay tak biimaar rahanaa bhi period ko aniyamit karata he
 It is usually temporary
 aap jaise-jaise apni beemaari se ubarne lagate hai aapke period regular hone lagegein
 Changes in your schedule, including working at night shifts, going to the out-of-station or having a wedding-party at home, affect your body
 aise main agar aapke period aniyamit ho jate hai to ghabaraaen nahin, jaise-jaise aap is parivartan ke aadi hote jaaenge, aapke period niyamit ho jaaenge
 Birth control pills and some other medications can also cause your period to become irregular
 agar aisa ho to doctor se sampark jarur karen
 Overweight is also a major cause of irregular menstruation
 proper eksrasij karen or healdi diet len
 Periods also become irregular during pre-menopause
 kuch mahilaon main is dauraan baari raktasrav to kisi ko kam bliding hone lagati he
 Unbalanced hormones are also a cause of irregular periods
 tinegers main, policystic overi syndrome naamak hormone kaa asantulit hona aam baat he
 It is this hormone that affects their period
 period shuru hone ke shuruuaati samay main kai tinegers ko aniyamit period hone kii samasya rahati he
 During this time, the hormones of the body are not adjusted and the eggs are not released every month from ovaries
 jis kaaran aapkaa cycle aniyamit hone lagata he, yah samasya 3 maah ke andar thik ho jaati he
 The ruckus that arose from a Facebook post among IIMC students led to a complaint by the SC-ST Act, leading to a written complaint to tell a teacher the root of the whole case
 ab yah maamla ek teacher dwaara chaatr ko dhamkee die jane tak pahunch gaya he
 Post on Rohit Vemula's suicide, a student studying at IIMC wrote a Facebook post a few days ago on social media's intentions to question Rohit Vemula's suicide
 is post par kuch chaatro ne aapatti jaahir kii or ise lekar college ke saath hi essi-asti kamishan, adivasee maamalon ke mantralay, or saamaajik nyaay mantralay tak shikaayat kar di
 The debate started on a Facebook post between two students studying at IIMC about the death of Rohit Vemula and the rhetoric on social media about it
 isi bahes ke dauraan duusare chaatr ne is sambandh main ek post likhakar maamle main campaning kar rahe logon kii niyat par sawaal uthaaya
 Two students of another department disagreed with his post and complained about it to the college as well as the SC-ST commission, the tribal affairs ministry as well as the social justice ministry
 post se bhavanaaen aahat hone kii shikayatchatro kahana he ki us post se unki bhavanaaen aahat huin or wo sambandhit chaatr ke khilaaf kadi karrwai chaahate hai
 After his complaint, the college set up a committee to hear the matter, not including the head of the accused student's department
 ab aaropee chaatr kaa kahana he ki use kuch bolne nahin diya ja rahaa or use aise maahaul main bahut dar lag rahaa he
 The student accused the teacher that it is being told that on Wednesday evening, a student of IIMC heard Amit Sengupta, teacher of English Journalism Department, inciting other people
 usne is baat kii likhit shikaayat oesady anuraag mishra or anya vibhaagadhyakshon se kii
 After this complaint, the alleged accused teacher Amit Sengupta surrounded the student campus and started talking about withdrawing the complaint
 placement kaa vakt kareeb hone se ghabaraaya chaatrchaatr ke mutabik teacher ne kaha ki agar wo shikaayat waapas nahin letaa he, to wo us par manahani kaa mukadmaa kar denge
 He and some students had a heated debate on this issue
 ab sunne main aa rahaa he ki teacher ne chaatr ko dekh lene kii dhamkee di he
 The student is nervous because the placement time is close and he has said to complain about this again
 beete kuch samay se charchaa main he santaanakendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantralayake antargat aane vaala yah santhaan main beete kuch samay se charchaa main he
 Earlier, questions were raised on the DG of the institution and then after his departure, the convocation ceremony of the students of the previous batch is also being delayed due to the arrival of the new dgina

 Addressing an election meeting in pimpri-chinchwad, Kisanpune, which is suffering from power problem, Advani said that due to power shortage, the industrial units of the state have gone out, which has led to unemployment
 unhone kaha ki bijli kii samasya ke kaaran kisaanon kii samasyaon main bhi ijapha hua he, jiske kaaran vah aatmahatya karne kaa majaboor ho rahe hai
 Keeping the example in front of the people, there has been increase in inflation, the leader said that there is no power crisis in the BJP ruled states, which is leading to the development of that state

 sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii 137veen jayanti ke maukey par gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne narmada jile main 'louh purush' sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke ek smarak kaa shilanyas kiya
 LK Advani was also present on this occasion
 sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii viraasat ko lekar do din purv gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke bich ek tarah se saarvajanik bahes hone ke baad modi ne aaj patel kii pratimaa kii aadharshila rakhi
 This statue of Sardar Patel will be the tallest statue in the world and is named Statue of Unity
 is murti kii oonchai 182 meter hogi or yah paanch saal main kareeb 2500 karod rupee kii laagat se taiyaar hogi
 At the same time, the Congress is feeling uneasy due to Narendra Modi's love for Sardar Patel and there is also a war of words between the two parties
 modi ne buudhvaar ko apane blog par likhaa tha, sardaar patel kii jayanti or bhi vishesh hogi, kyonki ham stechu of unity kii aadharshila rakhane ja rahe hai
 He wrote, the 182 meter high 'statue of Unity' will be among the world's tallest statues, through which a tribute will be paid to the Iron Man of India
 yah sadhu bet main sthit hogi, jo sardaar sarovar baandh ke najadik he
 Modi said in the blog, the statue is being constructed using PPP model using modern technology
 kuch maheene pehle maine bharat bhar ke mere kisaan bhaaiyon or bahanon se anurodh kiya tha ki pratimaa ke nirmaan ke liye apni kheti main istemaal hone vaale lohe ke upkarnon ko daan main den
 He said that Sardar Patel was not only an iron man, but also a peasant son
 main ek baar phir sabhi se hamaare is prayaas main sahyog kii apil karata hum
 During the inauguration of the Sardar Patel Museum on Tuesday, there was a debate between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi over the claim on Patel's legacy
 narendra modi ne kaha tha ki agar sardaar patel bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri hote, to desh kii dasha or disha hi agal hoti, vahiin pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne patel ke dharmanirpeksh rukh kii yaad dilaai
 Modi wrote in his blog, Sardar Patel was the creator of modern India
 unhone anek avarodhon ko paar karke puure desh ko ek kiya or aaj ham hamaari ekta kaa utsav manaa sakate hai, jo sardaar patel ke prayaason ke kaaran mili he
 He wrote, it is equally true that there are some forces in our country who are not getting this unity
 unhone logon ko daraane or gumraah karne ke liye banduukon or bam kaa istemaal kiya
 We should send a strong message to these elements from the country of Lord Buddha, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel that their path of violence will not work
 unhen apana rasta badalakar mukhyadhara main aana chahie or desh ke vikaas ke liye kaam karnaa chahie, taaki sardaar patel jaise mahaan netaaon ke sapane puure ho saken
 The 'statue of Unity' will be nearly twice as high as the 93-meter-high 'statue of Liberty' in America and four times higher than the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro

 rajkot range ke aiji diaar patel ne kaha ki do hajaar se adhik pulicekarmi, rajya police rigerv bal kii teen companiyaan, areef kii ek company, twarit pratikriya prakoshth kii saat timen or paanch police adheekshak tainaat kiye gaye hai, taaki match sugamawa purvak sunishchit ho

 haalanki, koi bhi vyakti jo bal yaa dadhi katwataa he use in chunaavon main mat dene kaa adhikaar nahin hoga
 In this way, this bill will reform the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925, which governs the gurdwaras of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh
 sikh gurudwara kanoon, 1925 main sahajadhari sikhon ko jo bal chote karaate hai yaa dadhi banavaate hai unhen vot daalane kii vishesh rup se anumati he
 That exemption has been abolished through this bill
 ab bal-dadhi katwane vaale sahajadhari sikhon ko bhi vot dene se vanchit kar diya jayega
 During the debate in the Lok Sabha, there were repeated shuffling between Akali Dal members and Congress and AAP members under the leadership of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal

 The BJP claimed it was a social media scam, claiming that Gehlot took the step after falling behind the state BJP president Vasundhara Raje in the matter of Laika
 bijepi pravaktaa ne mukhyamantri gahalot par istambul kii iti form se like kharide jane kaa aarope lagaaya tha or kaha tha ki congress soshal media par bhi apni galat chhavi pesh kar rahi he
 On this allegation of BJP, Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said, 'on Facebook anyone can sit and like anywhere
 is par andeh karne kii kya baat he
 Chief Minister is a popular figure
 lokapriyata paane ke liye unhen is str tak girane kii jarurat nahin he
 The Congress retorted that if i sit in Jaipur and enter my location in Istanbul, the page will show only Istanbul
 aise main yah kisi sajeesh kaa hissaa ho saktaa he or bijepi badnaam karne ke liye yah kaam bhi kar sakati he
 The Congress spokesperson said, 'you know how expert the people of BJP are in the cyber world and it has been their habit to do all this
 'gauratlab he ki rajasthan main disambar main chunaav hai or aise main gahalot or vasundhara apni-apni yatra ke saath janata ke bich nikle hue hai or unke sibar export sibar war room main apni alag ladaai jari rakhe hue hai

 In the lush green hills of Shivalik and the beautiful view of the Ganges in the Pashulok Barrage, as if it was not in front of him, he was seeing that the AIIMS in which he had put the best three years of life for admission there is neither teacher nor lab nor Hospital only

 pichley shiksha satr main har college main 50-50 yani kul 300 chaatr-chaatraon ko daakhila diya gaya
 All these students came here on the basis of the merit of the entrance examination of AIIMS, Delhi, the most prestigious examination of medical admission in the country
 inamen se 90 fisadi se zyada chaatr aise hai jo ames main daakhila lene se pehle kisi na kisi medical college main daakhila paa chuke the
 Last year, where 300 students got admission in MBBS, this year this number has been increased to 600
 iske alaava 360 nursing students bhi is baar chah nae ames main daakhile ko taiyaar hai
 The government claims that the hospitals will be made operational from July 1, 2013

 ”echelel saarvajanik kshetra kii company hindustan letex limited kaa chota naam he, jo condom banane ke liye mashhoor he, lekin rishikesh main ames ke residential complex kaa civil work kara rahi he
 Fed up with the irresponsible work of this company, AIIMS administration has also registered an FIR against the company
 ''yah sab dekhte hue, yah suchit kiya jaataa he ki yadi echelel limited kaa isi tarah kaa tandav jari rahaa to aagaamee shiksha satr main embibies chaatro ke nae batch, shikshakon kii bhartee, nursing staff kii bhartee or nursing paathyakram ke chaatro kii bhartee kii prakriya turant roak di jaae

 Despite this letter, when Dr
 kumaar se poocha gaya to unhone kaha, ''ek aadmi ke kehane se hamaara kaam gaiyrkanoonee nahin ho jayega
