 ' chennai superkings ko ipel kanoonon ke mutabik bain kar dena chahie
 In the matter of spot fixing, all the officials of BCCI should take responsibility and take strict steps to prevent such fixing
 ye baat ajtak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main bijepi ke saasand or purv test cricketer kirti aaazaad ne kahi
 Kirti Azad said that if he were in place of Dhoni, he would not have played the IPL final under any circumstances
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya dhoni ko ek stand lenaa chahie ki team kaa maalik pakadaa gaya he isliye unhen bhi chennai super king main nahin rahanaa chahie
 On this question, Kirti Azad said- 'this is what you should ask Dhoni, what does his heart say but if i were in his place, i would not play, i would say i don't want to earn money, to earn as much as possible, forgive me, i It cannot
 or ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki ipel kii up cameti kya karti he, unhen sabase bada faisla lenaa he ki kya ipel kanoon ke antargat is team ko khilaanaa chahie
 'will the BCCI inquiry committees come to any conclusion? Because he is being run by the same people who are involved in this whole mess
 is par kirti aaazaad ne kaha- ‘ye pehle 2009 main south africa main hua tha
 After that a board committee was formed, whose report was not revealed to anyone for the last four years
 sarkaar kii taraf se gathit yashavanth sinha cameti ne 2010 main jo report di usamen kaha gaya ki ipel ke andar bahut gorakhdhandha hua he
 FEMA was violated in that
 epabiai, arabiai ke ulanghan hue
 Under which 1 thousand 8 crore rupees were taken out of the country
 jo sarkari mulajim the unhen sajaa mili, lekin bisisiai main aaj bhi wo log baithe hai
 Why that report has not been revealed yet
 ’ek sawaal ke jawaab main kirti azaad ne kaha- ‘1999 main sibiai kii report aane par khilaadiyon par life time bain laga diya
 But this time you just suspended the players
 us vakt massej acha gaya tha or isiilie 2000-2008 tak koi gadabadi nahin hui
 Are all disciplines only for the players
 ye anushaasan officers ke liye kyon nahin yaa phir bisisiai ke adhikariyon ke upar kyon nahin? paardarshita, javabdehi or jimmedaari kiski he? cricketer to 50 lakh ke liye bik jaataa he
 He sells his conscience for 50 lakhs
 uske aage ke log 5 karod, 50 karod, 500 karod or 5,000 karod kamaate hai, lekin jo gorakhdhandha aakhon ke saamne ho rahaa he
 Why is nothing being done to stop him
 ’kya netaaon ko cricket ko alavida kah dena chahie or peshewar or purv khilaadiyon ko hi cricket chalaanaa chahie? is par kirti aaazaad ne jawaab diya- ‘vishwa bhar main peshwar prabandhan sangh hi khel ko chalaate hai lekin hindustan main aisa nahin hota
 Today the recognition of the Indian Olympic Association has been revoked
 is paristhiti ko dekhte hue bisisiai kii bhi manyata radd honi chahie
 But could not be done because 80 per cent of the money to the ICC goes from India
 isliye wo khud kuch karte hue darate hai
 His name is Narasimha, but without teeth and without nails
 wo bechaara kya kisi ko maaregaa, wo kehane ke liye isisi he jise tii-20, world cap or chapian trophy karwaane ko mil jaati hai or wo isi main khush hai
 He gets the rest from the BCCI so he does not say anything
 ’to kya jab tak ye puraa maamla sulajh nahin jaataa ipel ko band kar dena chahie? is sawaal kaa uttar dete hue kirti azaad ne kaha- ‘khel kyon band ho, khel to vahi he
 It is the responsibility of those who play and those who feed, that is, those who are sitting in the association
 aaj bisisiai main jo log baithe hue hai, gadabad kar rahe hai, ek-duusare ko chhupate rahete hai, raajnneetik log hai, apni pratishtha banaae rakhte hai or apni pratishtha ke kaaran kehete hai jo jaataa he dhul main to jaae or uski kameez meri kameez se zyada safed nahin honi chahie
 'is BCCI chief n
 shrinivasana ko istipha dena chahie
 On this question, Kirti Azad said - 'how many will resign
 en
 Srinivasan should not talk that Meiyappan has nothing to do with the team
 jab ki ye jaahir hota he ki unke paas har jagah jane kaa paas tha sirf dressing rum ke
 We are going to Srinivasan but there are many people who play from behind
 mahabharat kaurav or pandavon ke bich hua tha, lekin unke peeche shakuni mamaa bhi baithe the
 Who played an important role in getting the fight done
 ’jab rahul kavanal ne unase poocha ki bisisiai or ipel kaa kanoon hi ye kahata he ki koi bhi team kaa maalik kisi bhi galat gatividhi main pakadaa jaataa he to us team ko bain kar dena chahie
 So should Chennai Super King also be banned? On this, Kirti Azad said- 'absolutely, should be banned according to the rules
 ’jab unase poocha gaya ki kya naitikta ke aadhaar par rajeev shukla ko bhi jimmedaari lete hue istipha de dena chahie? is par kirti azaad ne kaha- ‘inkaa istipha baad main banataa he usase pehle sawaal banataa he displenry cameti kaa
 And even before that a legal cell is made, who did not make such laws earlier
 ’to aap kah rahe hai ki arun jetali kaa istipha pehle hona chahie or baad main rajeev shukla kaa? kyonki ipel main jo gandagi he use roak paane main wo naakaam rahe hai
 On this, Kirti Azad said- 'if the medicine was given at the right time, the patient would have survived
 agar pehle radio therapy kar di jaati to tumor cancer main nahin badalata, lekin aaj ye cancer main tabdeel ho gaya he or iske liye jo doctor jimmedaar hai us par jurmaana laganaa chahie
 Even those who did not act strictly, did not make laws
 cricket main gadabadi hone ke 24 ghante main kaarywahi honi chahie
 In this game you can not wait
 asad rauf par pichley saal bhi kuch iljaam lage
 Did nothing then
 is baar bhi sari game ho gai jab do match bache to kaha ki unhen match mat khilne do
 The ICC spoke double-handed here
 itane vakt main to asad kitni gadbadiyaan kar chukaa hoga
 Suspend the players, ban them, it is easy but it is not easy to act on the officials who messed up
 ’vaise kirti aaazaad ne bisisiai ke pressindet ke liye kai naam bhi sujhaaye jo naa sirf cricket ko kareeb se jaanate he balki unke mutabik eemaandaar bhi hai
 Kirti Azad said- 'there are many people who are honest, listen to cricket but i am afraid to take their name, that there is nothing wrong with them, but Shashank Manohar is a great person, Sanjay Jagdale is very close to cricket Know ye kuch aise naam hai jinhone cricket ko vakt or izzat donon hi di he

 Rites of East and West and many other things are mentioned
 hansi-majaak ke bich ek badi baat kehane kii koshish kii jaati he or film ko anjaam miltaa he
 Weak Links: - The story of the film is very weak and 2 hours 18 minutes seems quite big
 kahani ko or behatar likhaa ja saktaa tha
 - The film has a good start, but as the story progresses, it seems like what is happening
 script ko or bhi tite kiya ja saktaa tha
 Apart from Paresh Rawal, none of the characters of the film have emerged well
 - kai aise seen bhi hai jo kaaphi forcephul lagate hai
 - The songs of the film are also messed up, which makes its pace weaker
 film ko kyon dekh sakate hai:karthik aryan, kriti kharbanda, tanvi azmi kaa abhinay acha he
 Sanjay Mishra has done well
 vahiin paresh rawal is film kii jaan hai, jinaki vajah se kahani main fan bana rahata he

 Bhagwat had said that due to this unique feeling of unity, people belonging to religions like Muslims, Parsis and others feel safe in the country
 unhone kaha tha, 'parsi bharat main kaaphi surakshit hai or muslim bhi khush hai

 India and Pakistan have announced to build a corridor for Kartarpur Sahib, one of the important sites of faith of Sikh devotees, but Pakistan still does not desist from its nefarious activities
 sikh shraddhaluon ke pakistan sthit kartarpur sahib aasaani se or bina kisi aadchan aane jane ke liye coridor banane kaa elaan kiya gaya
 But on Wednesday evening itself, Pakistan barred Indian diplomats from entering the Nankana Sahib Gurdwara
 isi tarah rajanyikon ko guuruuvaar subah sachcha sauda gurudwara main jane se roka gaya
 India lodged a protest before Pakistan on Friday for allegedly harassing officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad and refusing permission to visit Indian Sikh pilgrims in Pakistan
 videsh mantralay ke mutabik bhartiya ucchayog ke rajanyik adhikariyon ko pareshaan kiya gaya or unhen 21 evam 22 november ko gurudwara nankana sahab or gurudwara sachcha sauda main bhartiya shraddhaluon se milane kii anumati nahin di gai
 The statement from the ministry said that despite being allowed travel permission from Pakistan's foreign ministry in the past, they were not allowed to go there
 bataa den ki ateet main aise avasaron par pakistani suraksha adhikari kii ore se bhartiya rajanyikon kaa maamla dekha jaataa tha
 But this time everything was happening under the supervision of pro-khalistan supporter Gopal Singh Chawla
 chawla ko kukhyat aatanki hafiz said kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 On Thursday morning, two officers belonging to the Indian High Commission Ranjit Singh and Sunil Kumar reached the Gurudwara Sacha Sauda
 donon adhikariyon ne gurudware main pravesh bhi kiya
 But as soon as Chawla and his henchmen arrived at the gurudwara, both Indian diplomats were outrageously forced to leave the gurdwara premises
 pakistan ne sikh pavitra sthalon main bhartiya rajanyikon ko pravesh nahin die jane ke peeche suraksha kaarnon kaa hawala diya he
 These diplomats are not even given a chance to meet Indian Sikh devotees
 bharat ne un khabaron par gahari chintaa vyakt kii he jinamein bhartiya tirthayatriyon kii pakistan yatra ke dauraan sampradayik vaimnasy or ashishnutaa ko uksaane or pruthakatawaad ko badhaava dene jaisi baaten saamne ai hai
 India Today has access to pictures and videos in which pro-khalistan posters and banners can be seen surrounding gurdwaras in Pakistan
 bataa den ki guru nanak dev ji kii 550veen jayanti par bharat se 3800 sikh shraddaluon ko pakistan sthit gurudwaron main jane ke liye pakistan sarkaar ne anumati di he
 In sharp contrast to how Indian diplomats were treated in Pakistan, India warmly welcomed Pakistani High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood when he accompanied 144 Pakistani devotees to attend the annual Urs in Sirhind
 tab unhone vahaan shaikh faruki sarhindi (mujadeed alf sani) ke majaar par jaakar maathaa teka tha
 According to the india-pakistan Protocol, 1974, on the pilgrimage to religious places, both countries have the responsibility to conduct such religious pilgrimage every year
 shuukravaar ko videsh mantralay ne kaha he ki usnepakistanse aise sabhi kadam uthaane ke liye kaha he jisase ki bharat ke khilaaf dushprachaar ko roka ja sake or saath hi algaavvaad ke himytiyon par majboot lagaam lage
 The Karnataka assembly election has not been announced yet, but political seats are being laid
 satta par kabiz mukhyamantri siddharmaiya rajya main congress kaa cheharaa hai or aane vaale dinon main unhen chunavi jang main bijepi kaa muqabla karnaa he
 On the other hand, PM Narendra Modi prepares such a political pitch in the state assembly elections that the contest is confined around the regional leader versus Modi and in this he gets beaten by his stature and popularity
 par karnataka kaa paridrishy ulta he, yahaan siddharmaiya khud hi modi ke daanv se bijepi ko gherne kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 BJP is upset with this trap of Siddaramaiah
 siddharmaiya ke trep main bijepidrasal siddharmaiya sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat ek ke baad ek bijepi ke aalaa netaaon par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 In return, the bjp's central leadership is also retaliating
 siddharmaiya ne pehle upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko nishane par liya, phir party adhyaksh amit shah ko or ab sidhaa pradhanmantri narendra modi ko
 In an interview to an English newspaper, he said that PM Narendra Modi is popular, but he could not fulfill his promises made before the Lok Sabha elections
 siddharmaiya or amit shah aamane-samnesiddharmaiya ne isse pehle bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko 'buddhiheen' or 'eks jail bird' (jo pehle jail ja chukaa ho) kaha tha
 Not only this, he had earlier called the people of BJP, Sangh and Bajrang Dal as terrorists
 karnataka ke siem bijepi kendriya netritv par lagaataar is tarah kii tippanee kar rahe hai
 Apart from bjp's local unit Siddaramaiah, the central leadership is also responding
 amit shah ne kaha ki siddharmaiya sarkaar bhrashtachar kii sabhi simaaon ko paar kar chuki he, siddharmaiya or bhrashtachar samanarthak shabd hai
 External vs
 local making Chief Minister Siddaramaiah is trying to make the political attack on top political leaders by him an issue of external vs
 local
 bijepi netaaon dwaara rajya sarkaar kii ja rahi aalochana ko siddharmaiya khud par nijee hamalaa jaisaa pesh kar rahe hai
 Through these attacks, Siddaramaiah is sending the message in Karnataka that in the coming elections, the contest is the top leader of Karnataka Siddaramaiah vs BJP in Delhi
 isse siddharmaiya ko karnataka gaurav kaa phayda milane kii ummid he
 The state unit of BJP itself is also understanding this game
 party kii ore se siem ummidavaar bies yediurppa ne apane aalaa netaaon ko ise lekar sachet bhi kiya he
 The plan to become the face of Kannada pride is that regionalism has always been an issue in the politics of South India
 siddharmaiya is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hai
 He knows that if he and his BJP leaders are sitting in Delhi, then they can become the face of Kannada pride and can convince people in their language and bring them in their favor
 ve nahin chaahate ki karnataka main muqabla siddharmaiya banaam yediurppa ho, agar aisa hota he to chunaav kaa mudda kshetreeyata yaa bhashaa kaa nahin balki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj or karpshan kaa hoga, jisamen siddharmaiya ko anti inckbansee kaa nuksaan jhelana hoga
 BS Yeddyurappa, the face of BJP in Karnataka in Yeddyurappa kashmaksh, wanted to focus on highlighting the achievements of the BJP government by highlighting the failures of the state government during his Parivartan Yatra
 itnaa hi nahin wo chaah rahe the ki satta virdohi rujhaan ko ek mudda banaae jaae
 But even before that, Siddaramaiah gave rise to the issue like Hindu terrorism and this was overshadowed by the reaction of BJP leaders
 modi kaa 2014 formulaayediurppa yah chaah rahe the ki jis tarah se 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan piem ummidavaar narendra modi sirf vikaas kii baat karte hue congress ke khilaaf sattavirohi rujhaan ko ek bada mudda banaakar chal rahe the
 The same formula should be applied in Karnataka as well, but Siddaramaiah is sitting his hand in PM Modi's Gujarat election
 wo modi kii hi tarah sthaneey bhashaa main logon se conect hone, bijepi netaaon ko bahari bataane par jute hue hai jaise ki gujarat main piem modi ne rahul gandhi ko bahari or khud ko gujarat kaa betaa bataakar siyaasi baaji apane naam kii thi
 The citizenship bill is an example of what happens to the craze of a country one law
 jab yah kanoon banegaa to desh ke saare hisson main ek tarah se lagu nahin hoga
 In the Northeast, this law is being implemented with many agar butts
 manipur main lagu na ho sake iske liye 1873 ke angrezon ke kanoon kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 For the first time there will be an Inner Line Permit
 ab bhartiya permit lekar manipur ja sakenge
 Even after this, there is no celebration about this law in Manipur
 chaatr sanghathan NESO ke aahvaan kaa vahaan bhi asar padaa he
 This law will not apply in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland
 assam or tripura ke un hisson main lagu nahin hoga jahaan samvidhan kii chhathi anusoochi ke tahat swytt parishad kaam karti he
 It will not apply in Sikkim as there is a provision of Article 371
 desh aise hi hota he
 Different geographical areas require different laws
 bharat hi nahin duniya bhar main kanoonon kaa yahi itihaas or vartmaan he
 Somewhere within a country the law is different for geographical reasons and elsewhere for community reasons
 in zaruuraton ke kaaran prashasnic dhaanche bhi alag hote hai
 But the thinking of Hindi states regarding Kashmir was blunted
 hindi akhabaaron or hindi channelon ne hindi pradeshon kii janata ko murkh banaaya ki jaise kashmir main ek desh ek kanoon kaa na hona hi sankat kaa sabase bada kaaran he
 Now the same Hindi newspapers and Hindi channels are not giving you a lecture on one country one law and no one is questioning the Home Minister or the Prime Minister
 sabko pataa he ki janata padhi likhi he nahin
 If you are educated, you are happy in devotion, then go out by speaking whatever you want
 aap hindi akhbaaron ko dekhie
 Are there concerns of the Northeast and news of the movement? Why are you being prevented from knowing? What will happen if you know? Because Hindi newspapers do not want the citizens of Hindi territories to be competent
 aap aaj na kal, hindi akhabaaron kii is janahatya ke asar kaa adhyayan karenge or meri baat maanenge
 The swarm of newspapers is killing the conscience of the poor and toiling citizens of Hindi
 ab bhi aap ek minute ke liye apane akhabaaron ko palat kar dekhie or ho sake to faad kar phenk dijie unhen
 The Hindustan newspaper has written that the last litmus test on the Citizenship Bill today
 rajya sabha main bill pesh hona he or hindi kaa ek bada akhbaar agnipariksha likhata he
 You know the litmus test

 unhone srisanth ko bekasoor bataaya he or kaha he ki srisanth isliye kah rahe hai ki jiju ne unhen fansaaya, kyonki srisanth ko jiju ke bare main pehle se kuch pataa nahin tha
 The lawyer also says that if Sreesanth had no phone record, then why was he arrested

 The mosque was built over the ruins of the temple, which stood there for a long time
 masjid ke banane tak ise hindu maanate the ki vivaadit kshetra kaa bada hissaa shri ram ke janmasthan se sambandhit tha
 Although that area was not mentioned
 masjid ke banane ke kuch samay baad se hindu vivaadit kshetra ke us hisse kii pahchaan ram janmabhumi se karne lage
 Long before 1885, Ram Chabutara and Sita Rasoi existed and Hindus worshiped there
 yah behad unic or apratyaashit he ki masjid ke ahaate ke bheetar hinduon kaa dharmik sthal he, jahaan namaaz bhi padhi jaati he

 ’ The Bihar government and the central government are face to face with the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme
 bihar main pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana lagu nahin ho paa rahi he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has strongly objected to the plan
 unki aapatti is baat ko lekar he ki har rajyon ke liye beemaa kii premier dar alag-alag rakhi gai he
 Under this scheme, the state and the center have to give 50:50 share of the donation amount, so why should the name of this scheme be Prime Minister's crop insurance
 biharsarkaarka maananaa he ki sabhi rajyon main beemaa ke premier dar main ekarupata honi chahie or is yojana kaa 90 pratishat kharch centre ko vahan karnaa chahie
 The farmers of Bihar are grinding in this quarrel between the Center and the state
 samastipur ke kisaanon ne fasal kshatipurti ke liye muaavja na milane par aatmahatya karne kii dhamkee di he
 There are different insurance rates
 Under the new scheme of Prime Minister Crop Insurance, the state government has to select the insurance companies by August 15, but the Bihar government is raising questions about the arrangement of this scheme
 is yojana ke tahatakendre or rajya sarkaron ko 50-50 fisadi raashi deni he
 Also, the premium amount has been fixed for all the states separately
 masalanutar pradeshke kisaanon ko 5 fisadi premium raashi kaa bhugtan karnaa he to bihar ke kisaanon ko 15 pratishat
 Bihar government did not accept the plan
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that it seems that this scheme is not made for the farmers but to benefit the insurance companies
 bihar sarkaar chaahati he ki beemaa ke premium main ekarupata honi chahie
 It should not be that if elections are held in Uttar Pradesh next year, then the farmers there have to pay less premium and the farmers of Bihar more
 is yojana ke tahat bihar ko saadhe chah sau karod rupaye dena padegaa
 The government believes that why not give such amount to the farmers for compensation, rather than giving it to the insurance companies
 sabhi rajya taiyaar: krishi mantribihar sarkaar ke sahakaarita mantri ne kendriya krishi mantri ke saamne maang rakhi he kii is yojana ke tahat centre ko 90 fisadi raashi deni chahie or 10 fisadi rajya ke liye nirdhaarit honi chahie

 The relationship between Pahlaj Nihalani, former head of the censor board and the disputes seems to be quite old
 bataur sensor chif to vah aae din vivaadon main rahete hi the, ab bhi ye silsilaa thama nahin he
 After bidding farewell to the censor board, Nihalani suddenly came into the limelight when she launched her very bold poster of Julie-2

 He also made it clear that he does not want to make a sequel to this film
 pachisia kii maane, to us vakt deepak ne unhen ye vishwaas dilaayaa tha ki wo ye film nahin banaaenge
 Pachsia says that now Deepak has not only made the film but has also registered its title Julie-2 in his name
 vah isejuli ke sikwalke taur par pramot kar rahe hai, jo ki gaiyrkanoonee he
 Pachisia has approached the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association on this

 Not only this, according to the report Pachsia has also filed a case in Mumbai High Court regarding the ban on the film

 Angry and frustrated by this, Srinivas and Parushuramamulu poured kerosene on themselves and set fire to it
 unke saath aae ek gramin ne kaha, "ham 10 baje se 3:30 baje tak intjaar kar rahe the
 Then we were asked to go without meeting

 Opener Virender Sehwag's finger injury and appropriate bowling combination remain the biggest concerns for India in the ICC World Twenty20 Super Eight ahead of the match against Australia

 It was a right fit for India in the match against England with five bowlers, but Dhoni loves to play with seven batsmen and in such a situation he can return to his old formula

 Australians have always been troubled by Turbator's presence and there is little chance of him being picked in the playing XI in front of a batting lineup that has left-handed batsmen like David Warner and Michael Hussey

 The researchers said that this theory can be understood in such a way that a region of the brain is immersed in memories and this brain also serves to tell the body about the cold feeling

 We know that it provides psychological relief

 The second study placed these participants in three rooms
 ek cameraa thanda (20 degree celsius), aaramdaayak (24 degree) or garm (28 degree) tha
 It was then measured how much they found themselves lost in past memories

 jin pratibhaagiyon ne kaha tha ki sangeet unhen yaadon main dubo detaa he, unhone yah bhi kaha ki sangeet unhen garmaahat bhi detaa he
 In the fourth study, in order to examine the relationship between memories and physical warmth, participants were asked to recall a golden memory of their past or a simple event by placing them in a cold room

 upi main bijepi ne jo master plan banaaya he, usame sabase bada nishaanaa mayawati ke dalit vot bank main bade paimaane par send lagaana he
 The BJP started its preparations long back
 isliye bijepi pehle ambedkar ke jariye apane dalit vot bank majboot karne kii koshish karti rahi he
 Taking the same sequence forward, BJP President Amit Shah said in an event on the occasion of Valmiki Jayanti that everyone is known by Valmiki for the epic Ramayana
 ramayana vishwa ke saamne bhartiya samskruti ko bataane vaala agradoot granth he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana, social harmony Amit Shah further said, 'what should be the ideal servant, how should be the ideal brother, sister, how can the ideal wife be
 in sab kaa varnan maharishi valmiki ne ramayana main kiya
 If Valmiki did not write Ramayana, then perhaps no one in the world knows Lord Rama
 bhagwaan ram bharat ke janamanas main amar hai or yuva peedi ko prerana de rahe hai
 For Dalit upliftment and Dalit harmony, he worked without much fanfare
 sant samaaj ne bina valmiki kii jaat puche unke gyaan or gunon kii puja kii, yah bataata he ki bhartiya samskruti ke khun main samarasata rachi-basii hui he

 Whether it is a common man or a special person, everyone thinks that no one is lacking in anything in their family

 For example, a salaried person works hard day and night to increase his income
 isi prakaar ek vyapaaree apane kaarobaar ko aage badhaane ke liye kai kaam karata he
 But it has also been seen that even after full effort by humans, it does not get the success that it expected
 bhartiya vaastushastra main iske liye kai upaay bataae gaye hai
 Here are some Vastu tips that can help make life happier: jis bartan yaa paatr main doodh rakhaa ho, use kabhi kabhi bhi khulaa na rakhen
 If the milk is hot then cover it with a mesh or clean cloth, but do not leave it uncovered
 ghar main cactus yaa kantedaar paudhe na lagaayen
 This leads to a flow of negative energy, which becomes a hindrance in bringing auspicious results
 khaanaa khaane se purv sadaiv / pratidin gaay ko bhojan karwaanaa chahie
 Not only Indian Vastushastra, it has been given great glory in almost all Hindu scriptures
 kehete hai, aisa karne se parivaar ke sadasyon kaa swasthya thik rahata he or dhan-daulat sambandhi maamle kii chintaa nahin kerani padati he
 While worshiping at home, where you have offered flowers offered to God for the entire time, it should not be allowed to stay in one place
 yah ghar main nakaaratmak urja badhaata he, isliye subah chadaaye gaye phulon ko sandhya main mandir se hataa dena chahie
 If there is a safe in the house, then it should not be approached near the kitchen and in the kitchen

 Emerging from an old father-son in Kulfi, Sonu sang this song of 102 from heart, as well as Amitabh's health is also changing, but despite this, he remains a constant in films and takes care of his own health Keep it
 jab 1 saal main amitabh kii 6 filmein relies huin, 3 main kiya dabl rolefilmon kii baat karen to amitabh aajkal apni aane vaali film 102 note out ke pramotion main vyast hai
 The film has a release date of May 4, 2018
 film main lambey vakt baad amitabh or rishi kapur kii jodi dekhne ko milegi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley dismissed the allegation of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi that the withdrawal of 500 and 1000 notes would adversely affect farmers
 jetali ne kaha ki congress netaa ko 'apane dimag kaa istemaal' karnaa chahie or ye samajhnaa chahie ki jo krishi main hai unhen kisi tarah kaa tex nahin dena padataa, chaahe wo ise bank main rakhen yaa ghar par
 Jaitley also called the allegation of Nehru Gandhi unfounded that the common man would face difficulties in withdrawing 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 jetali ne purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram kii ore se 2000 rupye ke nae note kii laagat ke anumaan ko bhi 'bahut badha chadha kar' kaha hua qaraar diya
 Jaitley said, 'as far as Rahul Gandhi is concerned, he should understand that no person, poor or common man, will have to face inconvenience
 'vitt mantri ne kaha ki krishi se hone vaali aamdaniay kar se muktahai
 Farmers, whether they keep money in the bank (depositing old and now withdrawn currency notes) or at home, do not have to pay any tax in both cases
 agar wo dhan bank main rakhte hai to unhen byaaj bhi milegaa or dhan surakshit bhi rahegaa
 In this way they will have three benefits - no need to pay tax, interest will be available and money will be safe
 agar wo ghar par hi dhan asurakshit dhang se rakhte hai to unhen zyada pareshaani hogi
 So before making such a statement, he (rahul Gandhi) should use his mind and think seriously
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne kai twit main is faisle ke liye pradhanmantri par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki asli apradhi apane kaale dhan par pehle kii tarah baithe hue hai or kisaanon, chote dukandaaron or gruhaniyon ko afra-tafari main daal diya gaya he
 At the same time, Chidambaram had estimated the cost of 18,000 to 20,000 crores on new notes of 500 and 2000

 a film is coming soon on him, titled 'super 30'
 is film main unka kirdaar bollywood abhinayta ruthik roshan nibhaayenge
 Today, even though millions of people know Anand Kumar, there is a strong struggle behind his success
 bihar ke patna se taalluk rakhane vaale anand kumaar ke pita postal department main clerk kii naukari karte the
 Due to poor economic condition of the house, he studied in Hindi Medium Government School
 skool ke dauraan unhen ganit vishay se kaaphi lagaav hua tha
 Where he devised new mathematical formulas by himself
 iske baad cambridge uniwarsity se unhen bulaava aayaa gaya
 The sanitary pad disposing machine was prepared because of this woman, she was not particularly good at going to Cambridge University as soon as she completed her studies in poverty, but when she was called from Cambridge University, she could not go
 vajah thi ghar kii aarthik sthiti
 He needed about 50 thousand rupees to go and live in Cambridge, Anand did not have that much money
 vahiin pita kii mrityu or tang aarthik haalat ke chalate unka sapana saakaar nahin ho sakaa
 After which all the responsibility of the house fell on Anand's shoulders
 ghar kii aarthik sthiti ko sudhaarney ke liye anand apana pasandida vishay ganit main bacchon ko padhaanaa shuru kiya
 Although he himself was educated in poverty
 jiske chalate vah padhai ke liye zyada fees bacchon se nahin lete the
 So he started making papad at home with his mother to earn some more money
 anand roj shaam ko chaar ghante maa ke banaae paapadon ko cycle se gum-gum kar bechate the
 The owner of crores made pakoda seller, such is the success story of how Anand Kumar became the subject of discussion
 The founder of Super-30, Anand Kumar, who was coaching the Joint Entrance Examination, got 30 out of 30 students
 jiske baad vah charchaa kaa vishay ban gaye
 All of them know that it is very difficult to get admission in IIT, but Anand had made the dream of admission of poor children in a prestigious institute like IIT into reality
 do bacchon ke saath shuru kiya 'ramanujan skool of mathematics'garib bacchon ke maseehaa kahe jane anand kumaar ne 2 bacchon ke saath apana institute 'ramanujan skool of mathematics' kholaa tha
 In this school, a student used to give 100 rupees and some 200 rupees in the name of admission
 bataa den, apane institute se wo har saal 30 student ko silect karte hai or joint entrens ejamination (jeii) advance jaisi pariksha ke liye taiyaari karavaate hai
 But before selecting these Super 30 students, the test is taken, in which only after passing, they are given a place in Super-30
 bacchon kaa chayan karne ke baad anand unhen apane saath rakhte hai or unki padhai-likhaai se lekar khaanaa-pinaa rahanaa aadi har ek cheez kaa kharch khud uthaate hai
 Engineering left for farming, started his own businessanand Kumar started Ramanujan School of Mathematics in the year 1992
 vahiin unke institute main zyaadaatar students aise parivaar se aate hai jinke paas enginiiring kii padhai ke liye utane paise nahin he
 Explain, in the year 2009, Discovery Channel featured a program on Super 30
 neuyork times ne bhi anand kumaar or unke super 30 ke bare main bhi likh chukaa he
 Anand Kumar's entire family is included in Super 30

 Earlier, injured Nuwan Pradeep was also ruled out of this test series

 Rested due to injury, Herath has not suffered any serious injuries, but he has been a regular active on the cricket field for the last three years
 unki umr ko or agle do maah main pakistan ke khilaaf hone vaali test siries ko dhyaan main rakhte hue chayankartaaon ne unhen aaraam dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Sri Lanka team coach Asanka Gurusinha, who will be treating Herath in Colombo, said, "our management has decided here, because we want our important player with the team
 hamane herath ke saath kisi bhi tarah kaa khatra mol na lene ke bare main sochaa he
 He would have been very close to bowling for 200 overs if he had played 6 even in the third Test
 unke sharir ke liye yah kaaphi adhik bhaar he' herath ne bhi is baat kii pushti kii he ki vah team ke saath pallekele na jaakar colombo main hi rahakar apana ilaaj karavaaenge
 Under the ICC World Cup-2011, the Chinnaswamy Stadium in the lap of Karnataka capital Bengaluru will witness India's first match played on Sunday
 bhartiya team ko apane pehle abhyaas match main khitaabi hetric bana chuke maujuuda champion australia se bhidana he
 50,000 spectators are expected to gather at the Chinnaswamy Stadium for this practice match
 yah match ravivaar ko khelaa ja rahaa he, aise main vishwa cap ke maddenjar bhartiya team kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye isse kai guna adhik darshak televijan par is match kaa lutf lete dikhenge
 The Indian team has concluded its four-day training camp at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) on Saturday morning
 chaar dinon tak khilaadiyon ne khel ke har vibhaag main guru gairi karston ke saath pasinaa bahaya
 During this time, many veterans of Indian cricket gave tips to improve the shortcomings of their players
 bhartiya team abhi-abhi dakshin africa daure se lauti he
 In this tour, she was successful in drawing the Test series but lost in the ODI series
 iske baavjood bharat kii saakh par koi fark nahin padaa kyonki usne antim samay tak ladate hue shrinkhalaa ganvaai
 Team India, playing under its host, is being considered as a strong contender for the title this time
 cricket ke jaankaron se lekar aam logon tak kii yahi raay he ki mahendra singh dhoni ke dhurandhar desh ko 28 varsh ke baad ek baar phir vishwa cap khitaab dilaane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Dhoni said a few days ago that he wants to win this World Cup for his team's most successful player Sachin Tendulkar, who is probably playing his last World Cup
 tendulkar apana chatha vishwa cap khilne ja rahe hai
 This match will be like a 'final' for India as it will know its shortcomings and strengths before the group round starts
 bahut kuch pataa he or bahut kuch chauthi baar khitaab bachaane ke liye baichaiyn dikh rahi riki ponting kii team se bhidane ke baad saamne aayega
 The match is important for the spectators as well as the team management and strategists, who are expecting some figures through it
 australia kii team vishwa kii sarvocch variyata praapt ekadivasiy team kii haisiyat se vishwa cap main hissaa lene pahunchi he
 To underestimate him would be nothing more than an idiot
 yah alag baat he ki ashes main use england ke haathon haar mili lekin ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main usne england ko 6-1 se haraakar sabit kar diya ki ekadivasiy muqablon main vahi bees he
 Through this match it will also be proved that the level of performance of the Australian players in the Indian environment will be because they have just returned from playing on the bouncy pitches of their home
 yahi bhartiya khilaadiyon ko bhi aankna hoga kyonki dakshin africa main unka saamana tej or oochaal yukt pichon par mejabaan team ke saath hua tha
 On the other hand, India's pitches are flat and help the spinners and due to this, molding their game according to the slow pitch will be a serious challenge before the players
 shanivaar ko kul paanch abhyaas match khele gaye lekin inamen se ek bhi match aisa nahin tha, jisamen barabari kii tiimon ke bich bhidat hui ho
 The india-australia clash will also be watched by those who are looking at these two teams as potential champions

 His body has been kept at his residence Krishna Menon Marg, where he is going to have his last darshan since late at 9 pm on Thursday
 ek puraani kahawat he ki mahilaayein pyaar paane ke lieshareerik sambandhbanaati hai, jabaki purush sambandh banane ke liye pyaar karte he
 But the thing to note here is that what happens in your mind in those special moments of love with your partner
 yani us vakt aap kya soch rahe hote hai
 Many interesting answers have come to this question asked for the study
 kai logon ne sweekaar kiya ki vah yahi sochate hai ki vah apane partner ke eks se behatar hai yaa nahin or kya vah apni partner ko santusht kar paaenge
 In a recent study, questions were raised about the thinking of both men and women in those moments of love
 jo jawaab aaen unamem se kuch aise hai-kai purushon ne sweekaar kiya ki jab kabhi unki partner apane kapade utaarti he to wo sochate hai ki kya unki partner hot he? logon ne kaha ki vah aise samay main uttejit ho jate hai, lekin iske saath hi man ke kisi kone main partner kii hotnes ko parakhane bhi lagate hai
 Often in those special moments the mind of the man is focused on making a relationship
 jabaki mahila ke man main kai saare sawaal chal rahe hote hai
 For example, will his partner always be with him or not? Will she be able to make her partner happy? Usually, women also have a question about how many women her partner has formed a relationship with
 haalanki unhe aise purush pansad hote hai, jinhen shaareerik sambandh banane kaa anubhav hota he, kyonki aise saathi unki kaamuktha badhaane main madad karte hai
 According to the study, women tend to like the compliment given to them by the partner during the relationship
 yah unke aatmavishvaas ko badhaata he or unki uttejnaa bhi badhati he
 If you want to enjoy married life to the fullest, then it is very important to keep your mother-in-law happy
 par kai mahilaayein khaastaur ve jinaki nai-nai shaadi hui he, is rishte ko sambhaal nahin paati hai or shaadishuda jindagi ko kadavaahat se bhar leti hai
 Keeping the mother-in-law happy is not so difficult either
 agar aap chahen to apane thode se prayaas se is rishte ko khushnuma bana sakati hai:1
 You are going to break away from one family and become part of another family
 aapke aane se pehle ye parivaar apane aap main puraa tha
 You are also a part of it
 unki apni aadaten hongi or apane tradishan
 Do not come to the new house thinking of changing everything according to your need and will
 apni baat unhen bataaen or unka bhi panit of vyuu jaanane kii koshish karen
 By doing so, find a common path and move forward
 2
 Do not enter a new house with you in advance
 apane saas-sasur ke nae vichaaron kokhule dil se sweekaar karne kii koshish karen
 You don't need to completely change yourself for them but don't think of changing everything in them either
 3
 You try to know what it is that you like and they too
 duniya main lagbhag har mahila ko ghoomana-phirana or kharidari karnaa pasand hota he
 Women also fondly watch their favorite shows on TV
 agar aap kahin aisi jagah baahar ja rahi hai jahaan aap apnimdar in lau ko le sakati hanto jarur le jaaie
 This will increase love and trust between you two
 saath main baithkar tivi dekhnaa bhi bura idia nahin he
 4
 aap apane saas-sasur ke saath dopaher kaa khaanaa baahar khaane ja sakati hai
 You can order them to your favorite restaurant by taking them to their favorite restaurant
 5
 You do not need to show false love
 agar aapako unki parvaah he to wo aapke haav-bhav main jhalkegaa
 You can talk to them about their childhood
 unki pasand jaanane kii koshish kar sakati hai
 6
 unhen bhi vakt den or khud ko bhi vakt den
 You are completely new to that family and that family
 aise main kuch bhi turant chaah lenaa or ummid kar lenaa galat hoga
 You both need to take some time
 7
 Be respectful with your husband
 aapaki saas ko jab ye ehsaas ho jayega ki aap unke bete se bahut pyaar karti hai to aapkaa rishta bhi majboot hoga
 Never put your husband in a situation in which you and his mother are seen as rivals ahead of him
 8
 You should act as a bridge between your husband and father-in-law
 isse aapkaa sammaan bhi badhegaa or log aapako pasand bhi karenge
 Keep in mind one thing in marriage, no one tells you to change your identity and thinking, nor is there any need for it

 pandrah saal se bhi pehle maine isaki aantarik shakti ko pahachaanaa or us samay jab bahut kam log is bare main vichaar karte the maine ek aise dastavej ko roopakar diya jo baad main ek agragami or preranadayak dastavej bana-andhra pradesh ke liye vijan-2020
 Similar work needs to be done in all states and union territories
 meraa pakkaa vishwaas he ki desh kaa maanav sansaadhan samrudh or acha he, or agar prashikshit karke unka uchit istemaal kiya jaae to ve kalpana se pare nattejey dikhaa sakate hai
 i had seen it then and i have been arguing that by the first quarter of the 21st century, India could join three or four of the world's highest nations
 aaj bharat main aisa hi ho rahaa he
 If you look at what Indians are doing around the world, it would be gratifying to know that they are doing exceptionally well
 isaki teen pramukh vajahen hai: bhartiya apane swabhaav se bahut mehnatee hai; ve mukhyatah madhya or nimna madhyavarg se hai, jinka vishwaas he ki dhairya kaa fal meetha hota he; or teesri baat yah ki ve kai nape-tule jokhim uthaakar udhyamshiltaa kaa bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai
 We feel tremendous power when we look at societies in Europe, America, China and Japan — we have a large number of young people who do not have them or can truly feel a sense of pride
 yah hakeekat he ki hamaari aabaadi kii 50 fisadi kii aayu 25 saal se kam he
 This is our biggest problem while for many developed and developing countries their aging population is the biggest deterrent
 bharat dhire-dhire nishchit rup se apni is takat kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 This is why India is reforming after freeing its economy in 1991 and adopting the characteristics of liberalization
 ek samaaj ke rup main hamaari pragati dilasa dene vaali he or bahut kam logon ko lagata tha ki halaat is tarah sudharenge
 But comparing it with other democratic and open societies, one gets heartbroken
 yah isliye ki amir adhik amir hote ja rahe hai
 Four of the 10 richest people in the world are from India
 isse bhi badtar yah ki sabase zyada amir logon main 40 fisadi bhartiya hi hai
 This is not a good sign for a multi-layered society like ours
 dhan kaa nirmaan jaruri he lekin dhan kaa sarthak vitaran bhi utana hi jaruri he
 This is the real challenge in addressing our social concerns and bridging the gap between the affluent and the disadvantaged
 lekin hamen use puraa karne ke liye peyajal muhaiyaa karaane, kuposhan dur karne tathaa apane logon ko behatar swasthya seva dene jaisi saamaajik chunautiyon se nibatane ke liye apni rajnatik, prashasnic or yahaan tak ki nyaay vyavastha main bhi sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 There is a system in our Constitution to prevent any kind of excesses, but there is little or virtually no system to prevent the democratic system and institutions from doing their duty and carelessness in performing their responsibilities and duties
 hamaare loktantr ko isse badhat or ghaataa, donon he
 We need to find competent people who can plan and implement meaningful reforms so that all democratic institutions are activated and the head of society is made accountable
 nijee swaarth ke liye vyavasthaaon ko todane ke prayaas rokane chahie
 Instead, methods should be devised to strengthen these institutions and if necessary, by suggesting far-reaching reforms, they should be vigorously implemented
 maine andhra pradesh main iske liye prayaas kiye hai, kuch vishwastareey buniyadi dhaanche or suvidhaayen taiyaar kii hai
 These include a new international airport, which is among the 10 best airports in the world, the Indian School of Business, which is counted among the best institutions, and an International Convention Center, which is unmatched across Asia
 mujhe apane isi anubhav kii vajah se lagata he ki bharat nishchit rup se agle 20 saal se bhi kam varshon main duniya ke pramukh rashtron main se ek hoga
 Not only for me, but if anyone wants to become a policy-maker while in politics, then the biggest challenge is to protect the sensitive sections keeping the interests of poor people in mind while creating wealth
 main hameshaa se yahi karata rahaa hum or karata ranga
 The cash transfer scheme, which i promised in the election, is a similar initiative
 meri koshish yahi rahati he ki duusare samaaj main aajamaae gaye garib samarthak kaaryakramon ko apane yahaan lagu kiya jaae
 Due to my social concerns, i try to bring balanced development and to take all sections of society together
 meraa maananaa he ki ham isi tarah majboot or swasth bharat kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 We are going in the right direction and i am sure that more and more political, especially new and young political, will demonstrate the necessary commitment and will
 agar un sabane patibaddhtapurvak aisa kar dikhaaya to viksit hote raashtra ke rup main ham logon se kiye gaye apane vaade acchhee tarah se nibhaa sakate hai
 N
 chandrababu naidu se 5 sawalap bharat ko aarthik sankat se ubaarane ke liye kya karenge?yah kuch samay tak rahane vaala sankat he
 We need to create wealth, generate more revenue, create employment opportunities and provide protection to the poor in this hour of crisis
 aap rashtriya suraksha main logon kaa vishwaas behaal karne ke liye kya upaay karenge?aatank ke khilaaf jang main tadarth pratikriya or ravaie kii jagah sakht niti apnaani chahie
 Administrative reforms, including implementing police reforms, are the need of the hour
 vishesh kaam karne ke liye haal main banaai gai rashtriya jaanch agency jaisi or sansthaaen banane se vishwaas behaal ho saktaa he
 Criminal justice system is in bad shape
 aap kya karenge?kai aayogon ne aparaadh nyaay vyavastha or jelon main sudhaar kii sifarish kii he
 We need to implement them immediately
 prashasan bhrashtachar or javabdehi kii kami kaa shikaar he
 What will you do? Develop a system that promotes transparency in decision making
 isamen praudyogiki kaa istemaal shaamil he
 Smart cards can be used to benefit welfare schemes to targeted beneficiaries
 raajnneeti kaa apradheekaran ab mahamari ban gai he
 How will you end it? The money received by political parties should be accounted for and there should be a system to stop black money
 isse apradheekaran ruk jayega
 For this we also need to improve the election process

 You will have to watch the film for further story
 baat film kii kaamiyon or khoobiyon kii
 The first half of the film is a bit loose
 first haaf kaa kaafii vakt qirdaaron ko jamaane main or kahani ko parde par rachane main chalaa jaataa he
 Although the screenplay is not loose, but yes, if the emotions emerged and appeared in the first part, then the first part of the film would also fall into the heart
 film ke gaanon kii likhaai acchhee he par jubaan par nahin tikte
 In the avatars of action and comedy that people have seen Ajay Devgan before, think that in this film Ajay will be seen in that avatar as people have seen him in 'zakhm' or 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam'
 tippaniyan 'drisham' is a story that will keep you with yourself

 In the second part, the film takes the audience on an emotional journey

 Talk about the shortcomings and merits of the film
 film kaa pehla bhaag thodaa dhilaa he
 Much of the first half of the time is spent in coining the tenants and creating the story on screen
 haalanki screenple dhilaa nahin he, par haa, imotions agar ubhar kar pehle bhaag main dikhte to film kaa pehla bhaag bhi dil main utarataa

 usne yah bhi likhaa he ki niyamon ke mutabik aath ghante kii duty karwaai jaani hoti he, lekin unhen lagaataar 20-20 ghanton kii duty par tainaat kiya jaataa he
 The comments jawan ne swasthya suvidhaon kaa zikr karte hue likhaa ki kaagazon par doctor niyukt rahete hai, lekin vaise vah salbhar nadaarad hi rahete hai
 Sick soldiers are sent to the district hospital
 jawan kaa kahana he ki force main kuch bhi niyamon ke mutabik nahin chal rahaa he

 In such a situation, the contribution given by the judges and lawyers will surely work for the flood victims of Kerala as well as to compensate for the damage done to the state due to the devastation caused by the floods in Kerala

 ” ek kendriya sachiv ne bataaya ki ab iees adhikari samaj gaye hai ki ve sidhe nishane par honge
 One big reason for this is that Modi is a Prime Minister who has been an active Chief Minister and has brought with him the same agility of administration which used to run in his state
 is samay unka sara dhyaan gharelu masalon or arthvyavastha kii haalat sudhaarney par he
 One secretary exclaimed, "the first priority of this government is domestic administration

 Now the Secretary has understood that the decision to keep the ministers under control has been made consciously, whereas in the previous government, the activation of the ministers was something else
 unka kahana he ki iskaa sanket is faisle se miltaa he ki mantri apni pasand ke nijee sachiv tak niyukt nahin kar sakate
 There are clear signs of this even in the daily process

 adhikariyon ne sajaa ke dar se faisle lene main rukaawat daalane ke nae tareeke nikaal liye
 The Supreme Court's landmark verdict in October 2013 laid down its traumatized vein over the petition filed by former government officials to keep the executive free from interference: political interference and verbal orders have reduced the level of bureaucratic functioning 
 magar yah faisla bhi isse bachane kaa rasta nahin de paaya
 It can be said that one of the direct reasons for the Indian economy to reach the lowest level in six years was the paralysis of the bureaucracy

 Naresh Chandra, a former cabinet secretary and eminent government officer, says that Modi must amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 to give the bureaucracy the right signal to protect government employees from being tortured for their decisions
 unka kahana tha, “adhinium kii dhara 13(1)di ke tahat ‘janhit’ shabd kii spasht paribhaasha kii jaani chahie
