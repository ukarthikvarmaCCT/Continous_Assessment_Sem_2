 ) For almost a quarter of a century, almost all newly elected Prime Ministers of India have focused heavily on leaving their distinctive mark on the operation of foreign and security policies in the first year after assuming office
 1991 main jab narsingh raav ne pad grahan kiya, tab desh diwalia tha, uskaa videshi mudra bhandar chintajanak str par kam tha or uskaa pramukh sainya saathi, soviet sangh, tut rahaa tha
 It was Rao's diplomatic skills that enabled him to establish a new paradigm of economic relations with the outside world
 sabase ullekhneey thi unki abhinav shluk isty niti, jo bharat ko purv or dakshin purv asia kii teji se badhati arthvyavasthaaon se jodatii thi
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee took power in a blistering way, he not only made India a nuclear power, but he also cleverly conducted relations with global conglomerates to thwart us-led global economic sanctions
 kargil kii oonchaaiyon se pakistani sena ko ukhaad phenkna or america raashtrapati bill clinton se pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko niyantran rekha kii shpavitrataay kaa sakvamaan karne ke liye majaboor karwaanaa, unke yaadgaar kadam the
 Similarly, soon after assuming office, Manmohan Singh cleared the way for the nuclear deal with the George Bush administration, ending global nuclear sanctions against India
 unhone chini pradhanmantri wain jiyabaao ke saath bhi samajhadaari se samjhauta kiya, jisase seemaa mudde hal karne ke liye maardarshak siddhanton kii ruparekha taiyaar hui
 When Narendra Modi took power, India was going through a severe economic downturn, which was born out of financial waste, economic mismanagement and universal corruption
 jab bharat kii antarrashtriya saakh kam rah gai thi, tab bharat ke dakshin asian padosi badmijaaj or baichaiyn ho rahe the or china teji se asia bhar main bharat ke prabhaav ko nasht karata ja rahaa tha
 Modi decided to take an active approach in foreign policy from the day he assumed office
 saarc (dakshin asian kshetreey sahyog sanghathan) ke sabhi padosi deshon ke shasnadhyakshon ko unke shapath grahan samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya, taaki ve saarc netaaon se vyannddhitagat rup se alag-alag parichit ho saken

 The Modi government has apparently accepted that as China moves towards becoming a consumption-based economy, India could be a potentially attractive destination for foreign investment in industries
 abhi yah dekhnaa baaki he ki kya ise, textile jaise rojgaronmukhi or ahm kshetron main bhi vaastaviktaa main badla ja sakegaa, kyonki vietnam or bangladesh jaise desh nae avasaron kaa laabh uthaane main hamase aage badhate najar aa rahe hai
 Also, do we have the necessary comparative edge in the areas of infrastructure, power and interest rates, which is crucial for global competition in the hi-tech industry? Modi has been successful in giving a new boost to our relations with America and other western conglomerates like France, Germany, Britain, Australia and Canada

 We should have no doubt that in today's world it is not in India's interest to rely exclusively on any foreign connivance

 It is expected that Prime Minister Modi will not allow the Chinese objections to stop him from expanding military cooperation with the US, Australia, Japan and other countries and pursuing concerted efforts

 We also cannot ignore the emergence of a us-led initiative to encourage China and Pakistan to support the reconciliation process with the Taliban in Afghanistan, resulting in increased Taliban control in southern Afghanistan

 Increase the defense budget: India is not in a position to compete with China in the economic future nor in the military

 '' a woman from Darjeeling has been accused of molesting friends of the woman for molesting and opposing three men in South Delhi early Tuesday
 police ne yah jaankaree di
 The woman, working in a private company, was returning to her home in Kotla Mubarakpur by joining a party with her husband and three friends
 der raat kareeb do bajkar 15 minute par jab vah log subhash gali crossing pahunche to sadak ke kinare sharaab pi rahe teen logon ne unke saath gaali-galoch kii jiske baad jhagada shuru ho gaya
 One of the injured gave this information
 usne bataaya ki iske thik baad sharaab pie vyakti ne mahila ko dhakka de diya or uske dost ko maaraa-peeta
 Apart from this, the woman's husband and another woman were also beaten up
 police ne bataaya ki do aropiyon 19 varshiya yogesh or 23 varshiya saurabh ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he or tisare kii talash jari he
 a case of attempt to murder has been registered on them
 lakshmi nepal kii rahane vaali he or baaki anya darjeeling ke rahane vaale hai
 Significantly, this is not the first case of molestation of women in the capital Delhi

 In this case, SHO of Delhi Cantt Police Station was also shown the line

 nyaayamurti ech el dattu or e aar dave kii peeth ne coli kii maut kii sajaa kii taamil par ek saptaah ke liye roak laga di
 An official of the Supreme Court said that an appeal was made before the bench after midnight in this regard and the order was issued at around 40 minutes past one o'clock
 adhikari ne bataaya ki aadesh ke bare main sambhddha jail praadhikariyon ko bataa diya gaya he
 It is notable that Surender Koli, who was sentenced to death in the Nithari incident, was given another chance by a Supreme Court verdict

 It is to be noted that last Tuesday, the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court, while giving a historic verdict, said that the reconsideration petition of those sentenced to be hanged will be heard in open court and the guilty will be given half an hour to present their case
 peeth ne ye bhi kaha ki jin logon kii punarvichaar yachika khaarij ho chuki he, wo ek maheene ke bheetar phir yachika daayar kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court on July 24 dismissed Koli's reconsideration petition on delayed grounds

 On July 27, the President rejected the mercy petition, paving the way for starting the judicial process of hanging Koli

 The CBI had filed a charge sheet against him in 16 cases in which he murdered children after sexual harassment

 pichhali baar centre or rajyon ke mukhyamantri disambar, 2006 main mili the
 From this you can understand how serious both the Center and the State are about the inter-state Council
 jabaki baithak main jis tarah se khulkar baaten huin, usase lagata he ki centre or rajyon ke sambandhon ko majboot karne ke liye kitna zaruri or gambhir manch he

 It was also said that the Center is continuously removing subjects from the list of states and putting them in the concurrent list

 in sabake bich is tarah kii baithak 10 saal baad hui yah bhi apane aapmen kam swaagat yogya nahin he, jo phir se hamen centre or rajyon ke bich ke sambandh ko khubasurat naaron kii jagah vyaavhaarik aadhaar par sochane samajhane kaa mauka detii he
 At the same time, a sacked government in Arunachal was being restored when good things were being said about cooperative federalism
 jayalalita kii tippanee se andaaza mil saktaa he ki rajya, centre se kya chaahate hai or centre ke team india kii baat ko lekar unka anubhav kaisaa he
 It was also said that the Center is continuously removing subjects from the list of states and putting them in the concurrent list
 jaise shiksha ko rajya kii suchi se nikaalkar samavarti suchi main daalaa gaya he
 The Center should return the rights to the states in terms of education
 tamilnadu mahasoos karata he ki centre rajyon kii karypalika shakti kaa atikaraman kar rahaa he
 Regarding the Inter State Council, Tamil Nadu also says that there is discussion here, but action is not taken
 is sanstha ko or majboot kiya janaa chahie
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that you have organized an inter-state meeting after ten years, you have not even asked the states what the agenda should be
 yojana ayog main hamen bolne kaa mauka miltaa tha, magar khatm ho gaya he
 At NITI Aayog, we also participate in the meeting once
 ve hamaari nahin sunate, niti ayog main kuch bhi nahin he
 The Akali Dal is a BJP government in Punjab
 vahaan ke up mukhyamantri ko bhi centre se tamaam shikaayatein raheen
 Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal said that the situation in the states has become like a beggar
 rajyon ko or zyaada shaktiyaan milani chahie
 Badal also said that the Center is taking possession of the rights and Iqbal of the states against the spirit and proposals of the Constitution
 sabaki aam raay he ki satta ke kendrikaran kaa trend bana hua he
 Obviously, this change is not of a day
 lekin jis tarah se maujuuda pradhanmantri kooparative federlism or team india kaa naaraa dete hai, usase lagata he ki rajyon ko adhikaar diye jane kii prakriya main badlaav nahin aayaa he
 The BJP talks of giving more funds to the states under the 14th Finance Commission, but the states do not consider it sufficient
 unki shikaayat vittiya sansaadhan ke bantwaare ko lekar jas kii tas bani hui he
 States are not talking about financial resources, but are talking about the attack on rights in other subjects
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha ki 14 wein vitt ayog ne rajyon ko milane vaale phaayde kam kar diye hai
 But the loudest voice in this meeting was against the Governor
 agar aap sabhi ke bhaashanon se alag alag tatwon ko lekar rajyapal kii chhavi banaaen to kuch is tarah ubharegi
 Reading his statements about the governors, mujhe laga ki rajyapal rajyon main centre kii taraf se lagaaya jane vaala sisitivi camera he
 Whose job is who is coming to meet the Chief Minister's office and who is coming out of there to meet them
 in sabakaa video footage ricard karnaa or uski sidi centre ko bhejnaa rajyapal kaa kaam rah gaya he
 In many recent cases, mlas have been writing letters of resentment and distrust from their government and leaders to the Governor and have also accepted the Governor
 arunachal pradesh ke maamle main supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne rajyapal naamak sisitivi camere se saaf-saaf kaha he ki wo centre kaa agent nahin he
 Therefore, the Chief Ministers feel that this CCTV camera is starting to interfere in their rooms too much
 isliye is sisitivi camere ko hi hataa dena chahie taaki mukhyamantriyon ko lage ki ve kisi nigaraanee main nahin hai
 Nitish Kumar said that till it is removed, the process of planting it should be transparent and Arvind Kejriwal asked that it be planted by asking the Chief Minister
 jayalalita ne kaha ki rajyapal naam ke is sisitivi ko mahabhiyog ke baad hi hataaya janaa chahie na ki raashtrapati kii marzi se
 Nitish said that while the cameras are being installed, the camera remote should be with the Chief Minister and it should work with the help and consultation of the State Cabinet
 arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane or court main ise galat sabit hone ke baad kai rajya raashtrapati shashan lagane kii dhara 356 ko lekar kaaphi ashankit dikhe
 Especially the chief ministers of non-bjp governments
 bhaajapa shasit pradeshon ke mukhyamantriyon ne centre dwaara rajyon ke atikaraman kaa sawaal nahin uthaaya
 After all, how could he tell his own central government that the rights of the states were being violated
 lagata he bijepi shasit rajyon main rajyapal kaaphi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that there is a need to stop the misuse of social media
 kattarwad ko rokane ke liye kai kadam uthaane honge
 There should be real-time intelligence sharing between the state and the center
 tippaniyan It may be that the newspapers reported more than the complaints of the Chief Ministers of the anti-bjp parties governments, or whatever the reporting has done, it seems that the Chief Ministers of the BJP neither have problems with the NITI Aayog nor do they get funds in any case
 They have no problem with putting the subject of the list of states in the concurrent list
 samavarti suchi kaa matlab yah hua ki us maamle main centre or rajya donon hi kanoon bana sakate hai, magar centre ne bana diya to sansad kaa banaaya kanoon hi maanya hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on the occasion that 14 wein vitt ayog ke kaaran kendriya karon main rajyon kii hissedari 32 pratishat se badhkar 42 pratishat ho gai he
 States have received 21 percent more from the Center in 2015-16 than in 2014-15
 koyala khadaanon kii nilaamee se rajyon ko aane vaale varshon main kareeb saadhe teen lakh karod raashi milegi
 The Center will give 75 percent of its subsidy to whichever state reduces kerosene consumption
 pradhanmantri yani centre kii baat kuch or, mukhyamantri yani rajyon kii baat kii disha kahin or
 The Prime Minister did not say anything about the apprehension of the states regarding the rule of President rule, using section 356
 yah zarur kaha ki khule maahaul main charchaa ho or sabhi apana suzav den
 The Prime Minister was calling this meeting a symbol of the spirit of Cooperative Federalism, with many states questioning the non-adherence to the spirit of Cooperative Federalism
 in sabake bich is tarah kii baithak 10 saal baad hui yah bhi apane aapmen kam swaagat yogya nahin he, jo phir se hamen centre or rajyon ke bich ke sambandh ko khubasurat naaron kii jagah vyaavhaarik aadhaar par sochane samajhane kaa mauka detii he
 At the same time, a sacked government in Arunachal was being restored when good things were being said about cooperative federalism
 punjab main akali dal bijepi kii sarkaar he
 The Deputy Chief Minister also had many complaints from the Center
 up mukhyamantri sukhbir badal ne kaha ki rajyon kii sthiti bhikhaariyon jaisi ho gai he
 States should get more powers
 badal ne bhi kaha ki centre samvidhan kii bhaavana or prastaavon ke kilaaf rajyon ke adhikaar or ikbaal par kabza kar rahaa he
 It is common opinion that the trend of centralization of power remains
 zaahir he yah badlaav ek din kaa to nahin he
 But the way the current Prime Minister gives the slogan of Cooperative Federalism and Team India, it seems that the process of giving powers to the states has not changed
 bijepi 14wein vitt ayog ke tahat rajyon ko adhik fund diye jane kii baat karti he, magar rajya ise paryaapt nahin samajhate hai
 Their grievance remains as to the sharing of financial resources
 rajya apni baat sirf vittiya sansadhano ko lekar nahin kah rahe, balki anya vishyon main adhikaron par ho rahe hamale ko lekar bol rahe hai
 Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said that the 14th Finance Commission has reduced the benefits to states
 lekin is baithak main sabase zyaada awaz uthi rajyapal ke kilaaf
 If you create the image of the governor by taking different elements from everyone's speeches, then something will emerge like this
 rajyapalon ke bare main unke bayanon ko padhate hue, i felt that the governor is a CCTV camera installed in the states
 jiskaa kaam he ki mukhyamantri ke daftar main koun milane aa rahaa he or koun vahaan se nikalakar unase milane aa rahaa he
 Recording video footage of all this and sending its CD to the center has become the Governor's job
 haal ke kai maamalon main vidhayak apni sarkaar or netaa se naaraazgi or avishvaas kii chitthiyaan rajyapal ko bhi likhte rahe hai or rajyapal sweekaar bhi karte rahe hai
 In the Arunachal Pradesh case, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court has clearly stated through a CCTV camera named Governor that he is not an agent of the Center
 lihaaza mukhyamantriyon ko lagata he ki yah sisitivi camera unke kamaron main kuch zyada hi dakhal dene laga he
 Therefore, this CCTV camera should be removed so that the Chief Ministers feel that they are not under any surveillance
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jab tak ise hataaya nahin jaataa, iske lagane kii prakriya paardarshee ho or arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki mukhyamantri se poochkar ise lagaaya jaae
 Jayalalithaa said that this CCTV named Governor should be removed only after impeachment and not by the President's will
 nitish ne kaha ki jab laga hi rahe hai to camere kaa remote mukhyamantri ke paas ho or yah rajya mantrimandal kii sahaayta or paraamarsh se kaam kare
 After imposing President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and after proving it wrong in court, many states were very apprehensive about the imposition of President's rule
 khaskar gaiyr bhaajapa sarkaron ke mukhyamantri
 Chief Ministers of bjp-ruled states did not raise the question of encroachment of states by the Center
 aakhir wo apni hi centre sarkaar se kaise kah sakate the ki rajyon ke adhikaar kaa atikaraman ho rahaa he
 Governors seem to be doing quite well in BJP ruled states
 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki soshal media ke galat istemaal par roak lagane kii zarurat he
 Several steps have to be taken to stop radicalism
 rajya or centre ke bich real time main khufia soochnaaon kii saajheedaari honi chahie
 The comments ho saktaa he ki akhabaaron ne bhaajapa virdohi dalon kii sarkaron ke mukhyamantriyon kii shikayaton ko hi zyada report kiya varna jitani bhi reporting hui he usase yahi lagata he ki bijepi ke mukhyamantriyon ko na to niti ayog se dikkat he, na unhen kisi maamle main fund milane se dikkat he, na unhen rajyon kii suchi ke vishay ko samavarti suchi main daalane se dikkat he
 The concurrent list means that both the Center and the state can make laws in that matter, but if the Center has made it then only the law made by Parliament will be valid
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is avasar par kaha ki Due to the 14th Finance Commission, the share of states in central taxes has increased from 32 percent to 42 percent
 2015-16 main rajyon ko centre se 2014-15 kii tulana main 21 pratishat adhik raashi mili he
 Auction of coal mines will give the states about three and a half lakh crores in the coming years
 jo bhi rajya kerosene kii khapat main kami karegaa, uski sabsidi kaa 75 fisadi hissaa centre use degaa
 The Prime Minister means something more about the Center, the Chief Minister means the direction of the states
 pradhanmantri ne dhara 356 ke beza istamaal, raashtrapati shashan ko lekar rajyon kii ashanka ko lekar kuch nahin kaha
 It was said that discussion should be held in open environment and everyone should give their suggestions
 pradhanmantri is baithak ko Cooperative Federalism kii bhaavana kaa pratik bataa rahe the, kai rajya isi kooparative federlism kii bhaavana ke paalan nahin hone par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Such a meeting between all of them after 10 years is also no less welcome in itself, which again gives us an opportunity to understand the relationship between the Center and the States on a practical basis instead of beautiful slogans
 kooparative federlism par jab acchhee acchhee baaten kahi ja rahi thi, usee vakt arunachal main ek barkhaast sarkaar phir se behaal ho rahi thi
 Obviously, this change is not of a day
 lekin jis tarah se maujuuda pradhanmantri kooparative federlism or team india kaa naaraa dete hai, usase lagata he ki rajyon ko adhikaar diye jane kii prakriya main badlaav nahin aayaa he

 If child marriage is terminated from India, then you cannot even imagine how much India can benefit economically

 Only four countries in the world are allowed to grow GM mustard, including the US, Canada
 australia shaamil hai
 Supporters and scientists of GM mustard argue that GM mustard oil is already being imported from Canada
 isliye jiem food kaa dar failaana bevajaah kaa hauvva he
 Now it remains to be seen whether the government will allow GGM mustard to grow in the fields in October and if yes, will it lead to the same revolution that is being claimed

 Therefore, the fear of GM food is unnecessary
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya sarkaar jijiem sarson ko oktober main kheton main ugane ke liye anumati degi or agar haa to kya isse vahi kranti aegi jiskaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he

 sunwaayee ke dauraan hoicourt ne kaha tha ki pratibandh lagaana sabase aakhri vikalp he
 The court said that why should the government use the last option first, the government will have to take steps in a sequential manner

 Therefore, the immersion was banned and orders were made for the immersion date

 Lal Krishna Advani finally agreed 24 hours after resigning
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne party ke kai netaaon kii maujuudagi main is baat kaa elaan kiya
 The press conference was called at Advani's house, although Advani himself was not present at the press conference
 rajnath singh ne adwani ke faisle ke bare main sabko bataaya
 He said that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat spoke to Advani and advised him to accept the party's decision
 adwani ne unki salaah maan lee
 In the letter of his resignation, there was a conversation between Rajnath and Advani about the objections that Advani had expressed about the party's looks
 rajnath ne kaha ki jab bhi adwani ji ko kisi tarah kii shikaayat hogi, ve khud unase baat karenge
 On the question of Advani not coming to the press conference, Rajnath Singh said, 'this is common courtesy
 main press conference main bolta or wo mere bagal main baithe hote, yah uchit nahin hota
 "why was Advani missing from the meeting hall of his own house? It is understandable that he did not go to Goa, but he did not understand why Advani was missing from the meeting hall of his own house
" sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne adwani ko apana faisla badalane par majaboor kar diya tha
 Advani could do nothing else
 rajnath singh do din se adwani ko ishaaron main lagaataar samajha rahe the ki unhen aaj nahin to kal maananaa hi padegaa nahin to man markar unhen unki chitthee par hastakshar karnaa hoga, kyonki modi to jahaan pahunch chuke hai vahaan se unhen nahin utaara jayega
 Rajnath Singh had to go to Rajasthan to throw this ace
 bansawada jaakar saaf-saaf boli nikali
 The language may be different, but it meant that Advani is big, he is right, Advani is older, it is also right, because of Advani, BJP is also right, but what he is doing now is not right
 bijepi ke is dard ke bich party kii dukhi atmaaon kaa adwani ke awaas par pahunchnaa jari rahaa
 Some went to worship and some expressed regret, but when they came out, they gave false hope of hope
 maan jaaenge mahoday
 BJP left the decision on Advani, as a matter of fact, the treatment of Advani was left in the niche of Advani
 vah chahen to jala len or chahen to buja rahane den
 The cure was that the BJP would run like this now
 ab yah unpar he ki vah saath chalenge yaa ekantavaas karenge
 Lal Krishna Advani continued to look red, but it is true that it was his only and last helplessness, and the interesting thing is that BJP also put the responsibility of finding an excuse to agree
 koi bhopal se aayaa, koi patna se or koi pados se, lekin baahar nikalakar sabane yahi kaha ki adwani ji ko maan janaa chahie, kyonki iske alaava or kuch samaj main nahin aata
 Advani was disgusted to agree that by the end of the evening it was decided that Advani would agree
 aadha to wo dopaher main hi maan gaye the
 The question of half was decided by politics
 to kul milakar adwani ruthe hi the maan jane ke liye
 Same BJP, same leader and same decision, but Advani agrees
 ghar main baithe-baithe ruthe the or vahiin baithe-baithe maan bhi gaye
 Jaswant Singh is the only leader who mentioned his feelings behind the outburst that some BJP leaders are busy in fulfilling personal agenda
 muddon kaa samaadhaan to na hona tha na hua, kyonki jo mudde adwani ne uthaae the vah modi ke itane mahatvapurn ho jane ke pehle bhi the or baad main bhi rahenge, lekin in do dinon main adwani kii samaj main yah aa gaya he ki wo bijepi ke gujarey daur ke devtaa hai
 Did not understand that as Advani did not understand, just as Advani did not understand, in the same way, it was not understood by anyone that Advani was obeyed, but he also agreed and agreed
 donon bhavanaaen adwani ne band kamare se jaahir kii
 Well, it had to be, because there was no other option but the other one is now two and that question is what will Advani do now? In front of the party, he had raised a dilemma that he had to choose between Narendra Bhai and Lal Krishna
 party ne kaha koi duvidha he hi nahin
 Then why did Advani write a letter to Rajnath Singh questioning the entire party and when he wrote it, what changed in BJP in two days? Did he really worry about the party's image? Or did he understand that after the pressure of the Sangh, u turn on BJP is no longer possible for Modi? Or there is a middle path between the party and Advani, in which there is scope for both position and honor
 kya party ne nahin kii adwani kii parvaah?sach to yah he ki adwani kii naaraazgi kii parvaah hi party ne chhod di thi
 After returning from Goa, one day, of course, the leaders also expressed concern over it, but the very next day, everyone started doing their work
 narendra modi alag sammelan karte rahe or rajnath singh alag
 In the remaining time, he thought as much as he thought for Advani
 bijepi ke sabase bade netaa ke vikalp simatate ja rahe the or isi ke saath badhati ja rahi thi dil kii dhadkan, kyonki ek din pehle kaa sawaal ab badal gaya tha
 On Monday, the question was what would happen to BJP without Advani, but now it was being said that what would happen to Advani without BJP

 The fire of yagna has been ignited for the last 8 days inside the Indore ashram at Khandwa Road, one of the 400 ashrams of Asaram
 havan kunda ke chaaron ore baithe teen-chaar bhakt is aas main raat-din baapu ji kaa sikhaaya mantra japate hue aahuti dete rahete hai ki unhen mukademon se mukti mil jaae
 They co-ordinate the wind with the wind
 buddhi vivek vigyaan nidhaana
 Swaha! While chanting, in front of the big picture of Bapu ji, in the pool made of scripture method with brick and dung, with a mixture of fennel, black sesame and sugar, open heart offering ghee is offered

 After being accused of misdeeds, this rule is being implemented more strictly
 sirf ashramakarmiyon kii patniyaan or betiyon jaise kaaryakarta hi ashram ke chaaron taraf prarthana kii vibhinn avasthaaon main baithe rahete hai
 Some of them keep on chanting Hanuman Chalisa on the loud speaker in front of Asaram's pedestal inside the bulletproof glass enclosure on the platform
 kuch log kaamana puri karne vaale ped ke saamne sashtaang pade rahete hai
 Beside it is a herbal medicine shop which also houses the office of Rishi Darshan, an ashram magazine
 ashram ke karyaalay main 5 sitambar kii maun raily kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi thim
 One by one the devotees were being called and they were told that i want 5,000 people tomorrow
 asaram ke bhakton ko vinamrata to sikhaai hi nahin gai he
 They follow you, keep an eye
 aapaki har harakat par gaur karte hai
 Why are you wandering around or looking for something or is there a flight tag on your bag? Have you taken initiation Why didn't you go to the ashram in Mumbai? What kind of woman has come alone to Indore? Why didn't your husband come along? Workers are sent to inquire you one by one
 aapaki talaashi lee jaati he
 Understand something, before that you get surrounded and this circle becomes more bullying and threatening
 aawaaj main jigyaasa se zyada dhamkee kaa put aa jaataa he
 If you do some computer work on the ipad and phone, then you will feel guilty, don't you know Bapu ji refuses? There is noise before you understand anything
 ashram band ho gaya he
 The doors are locked
 aapako baahar nikaalkar sadak par khadaa kar diya jaataa he
 If you do not walk away from the door while waiting for your car to return, you are locked in a lock in a chair next door
 tabhi saamne ke gurukul se ek gussell skool principal sabko dhakelta hua aayaa or bhavishya ke saboot ke liye tasviren khinchate hue bolaa, “tum apane aapako kya samajhati ho, yahaan ham se sawaal kar rahi ho, photo le rahi ho
 We will also take your photo
 ”yahaan ke maahaul main kuch laachaari bhi he
 One female servant said, "this is Kali Yuga, at the end the truth will come out, milk will be water of milk, we are not nervous
 hamen vishwaas he, bas vah to jaise aarope lage hai, unhen hajam karnaa mushkil he
 "there was a lot of drama in this Indore ashram last week when the Jodhpur Police squad led by ACP Chanchal Mishra came here along with Indore Police under the command of DIG Rakesh Gupta
 donon police daston ke saamne duvidha yah thi ki unhen aaropee ko bhaagane nahin dena tha or kanoon ke mutabik usase poochtacha kerani thi
 Also, it was to be seen that the devotees should not suffer any harm
 diiji gupta ne bataaya, “ham khaas taur par baba ramdev ke saath ramlila maidan main hui ghatana ko doharaana nahin chaahate the
 Our complete focus was that no devotee should have a single stick
 ” dur-dur se aae 4,000 se adhik bhakton ne ashram ko jane vaali sadakon par hari chataaiyaan failaa deen
 Now the police could neither pass over them with Asaram nor take the jeep inside the ashram
 police ne bhi teen din tak google ke nakshon se ashram kaa chappa-chappa chaanaa tha
 He saw that there is a road on which only the servants come
 vahaan saadi vardi main police vaale tainaat kar die gaye or baaki sadakon par vardi main police vaale khadey rahe
 Around 11 o'clock in the night, the servants sensed the tricks of the police and they started laying mats on the third road as well
 apni chaal naakaam hote dekh indore police ne jodhpur police se kaha ki jhatpat or sakhti se kaam nibataae
 Asaram sometimes threatened suicide, sometimes locked himself in a room and then disappeared for dinner
 jaankaar sutron kaa kahana he ki vah is ummid main taal matol kar rahaa tha ki shikaayat karne vaali ladki ke pita ko kharidne main kaamyaab ho jayega
 Asaram could not believe that his political devotees would betray him
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki uske talkh bhaashanon kaa ulataa asar hua
 One reason for the collapse of the fort of Indore was also that the media was lagging behind day and night
 jab asaram ko pataa lag gaya ki narendra modi ne saath chhod diya he to usne bhopal se ahmedabad kii udaan chhod di
 When he felt that the doors of the political corridor in New Delhi had been closed, he fled to Indore in the hope that a large number of supporters would call and take some time out
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki jodhpur kii asipi chanchal ne apane majboot iraade ke bal par hi yah maamla suljhaayaa, jab asaram ne khud ko kamare main band kar liya to unhone darwaja todgaye kii dhamkee di
 The ACP was determined that whatever happens, Asaram will be arrested and the trial will be carried out
 aakhirkaar kisi bhi najar se dekhen, uske patan kaa kaaran ek damdaar mahila afasar hi bani
 It is too late to close the doors to the Indore ashram
 college kii padhai kisi ke bhi kariyar main ek ahm sthaan rakhti he
 You decide the direction of your career only by studying here

 It has been barely a month and a half since Nitish Kumar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar, but the 'mahagathbandhan' that he had woven with RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav is already seen under deep pressure
 sholay film kii mashhoor jai or viru kii jodi se tulana ab beete jamaane kii baat hui
 No one even talks about the Biharis who have 'dusted' the 'outsider' BJP
 ek maheenaa bitate-bitate gathbandhan ke saajheedaaron main ek duusare ko patkhni dene kaa khel shuru ho chukaa he
 BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi says, "nitish is the Chief Minister, but Lalu is already behaving like a Super Chief Minister
 '' nitish kii 71 siton ke mukaable lalu prasad kii 80 siton ke saath vidhansabha main argedy kii halki-si badhat se bhi mukhyamantri kii mushkilen badi hai
 a glimpse of the ensuing events was found only on December 29 when Lalu held a press conference expressing concern over the increasing crimes in the state and also gave the Chief Minister a list of suggestions on what he should do and what not to deal with
 isse nitish ke kheme main bhaunhen tan gayi
 JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar and state president Vasistha Narayan Singh did not delay in reacting
 unhone saaf shabdon main lalu se baj aane ko kaha
 Senior Narayana Singh even taunted the RJD chief, saying that everyone knows how badly his party had left the state (during his reign), which Nitish had to clean up
 donon taraf se vyangy-baan barasaaye jate rahe magar donon hi khemon ke varisht netaa jis tarah se bad-chadhakar bol rahe the, usase lagata tha ki unhen party netaaon kii shah hasil he
 In the midst of all this upheaval, Nitish, who is generally calm and calm, also suddenly showed signs of stress
 isaki jhalak rajasav or bhoomi sudhaar vibhaag kii unke is kaarykaal kii pehali baithak main mili
 The Chief Minister had just sat down with his cup of tea and Principal Secretary Vyas Ji presented his power point presentation about the land acquisition process
 haalanki sabhi kii raay thi ki prajentation umdaa tha, magar bataate hai, saaf taur par khinn dikhaai de rahe mukhyamantri ne thodaa adheer hote hue kaha, ''yah sab to ham jaanate hi hai
 How much difference will this make? We have to make the real process of land acquisition easy
 ganga driveve kii hi misaal len
 The department should work for road construction and close coordination with the district administration of Patna to complete the land acquisition
 ''kuch hi pal baad nitish ek or atiutsaahi iees afasar ko jhidak rahe the
 In response to his talk, the Chief Minister said, "if you bring me here, then the whole land acquisition will happen, won't you?" Though Nitish's rebuke came with his smile, his Nagwari looked at the dozen IAS officers in the room
 Could not save march main 65 saal ke ho rahe nitish bihar ke mukhyamantri ke taur par apane paanchaven kaarykaal main naakaam hona gavaara nahin kar sakate
 On December 28, six days before the meeting referred to above, the Chief Minister appeared in a similar manner with a group of top police officers
 ye afasar ek baithak ke liye unke daravaaje par ikattha hue the
 Nitish not only refused to see his presentation, but most of them, all of whom were senior IPS officers, turned back on their feet
 nitish ne unase kaha ''apane daftar waapas jaaie or vah kiijie jo aapse karne kii ummid kii jaati he
 Nitish was angered by the continuing deterioration of law and order after the murder of a private power company supervisor and two engineers in Darbhanga (who say that his road construction company refused to pay extortion money), which was expressed in He did not do anything
 unhone saaf lafjon main kaha, ''mujhe aparaadh kii dar ke aankade nahin chahie
 i am not here to earn profanity
 yah isliye ho rahaa he kyonki aap log vah nahin karte jisaki ummid kii jaati he
 i want results
 giraftaar kaaphi nahin, unki sampatti jabt kiijie
 "lalu is laughing from behind? The RJD chief has not yet interfered in the affairs of the government so much but his impression on the government is clearly visible
" saamaanya prashasan vibhaag kii kaman haalanki nitish ke haath main he, magar lalu ne apane do bharosmand iees afasaron sudhir kumaar or aar
 K
 mahajan ko apane do beton tejasvi or tej pratap ke vibhaagon main tainaat karvaa liya he
 Both of them were with him in the Railway Ministry
 sachivalay ke sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki adhikariyon kii tainaati main lalu kii suni jaati he, lekin yah unke bihar kii sabase badi party kaa netaa hone ke naate samajha ja saktaa he
 The power establishment of Bihar also seems to be divided these days according to the governmental affairs controlled by the parties
 mukhyamantri ko milakar 29 sadasyon ke mantrimandal main nitish or lalu donon ke 12-12 mantri hai
 The rest of the ministers belong to the Congress
 kai log maanane lage hai ki bihar main satta kii kaman ab mahaj ek ghar se nahin nikalati
 The internal competition between the two centers of power is having the opposite effect on both the leaders
 lalu bagaiyr kisi jimmedaari ke satta kaa bharpoor majaa le rahe hai, jabaki jimmedaariyon ke saath satta kaa dabaav nitish par pad rahaa he
 In fact, they are seen hitting hands and feet very much in the process of fixing things
 gaddi sanbhaalane ke ek hafte ke bheetar 20 november ko bihar main sharabbandi kaa faisla isaki maujuun misaal he
 This shows how far the Chief Minister has come from his previous tenures
 pichley kaarykalon main unhone rajasav badhaane ke liye sharaab kii bikri kii nigaraanee par khaasaa jor diya tha (2015-16 main sharaab kii bikri se 4,000 karod ru
 Is expected to get revenue of Rs
)
 aaj ve khajaane main nakadi par jhatka sahane ke liye taiyaar hai, to kya yah lokapriyata kii daud main lalu se aage nikalne kii khatir he? agar aisa he, to philhal isamen ve kaamyaab ho chuke hai
 In Bihar, the first liquor will be banned from April 1, and then in September, the imported liquor bikini will stop
 lipaphe par baari majamoonnithish ko bakhubi pataa he ki hakeekat jitna hi vajan is baat kaa bhi he ki log unki sarkaar ke bare main kya sochate or maanate hai
 Recently, he removed his name from the list of vips running red lights in the convoy
 nitish bakhubi samajhate hai ki unka siyaasi kad ab mahaj ek mukhyamantri kaa hi nahin rah gaya he, balki unhen desh main 2019 ke liye ek bharosemand kendriya netaa kii talash kar rahe harek bijepi virdohi jamaavade ke vaikalpik netaa ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 He has equalized Narendra Modi's record in Gujarat by winning three consecutive times
 phir unke pichley kaarykalon kii uplabdhiyaan bhi unke saath hai hi, jinamein sadak, shiksha, urja or swasthya ke kshetron main saaf sudhaar dikhaai diya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why in the new term, they are working more vigorously in matters of governance
 lalu ke saamne doum darje kii bhoomika nibhaane kii bajaae unhone aakraamak hone kaa rasta chunaa he
 Sources reveal that he intends to give a safe tenure to a handful of working officers
 shahari vikaas or udyog sareekhe kam kaam karne vaale mahakme bhi unke nishane par hai
 This is not the first time that Nitish is leading a government in which his mlas count less than the coalition mlas supporting him
 bihar ke mukhyamantri ke taur par unke pehle kaarykaal main march 2000 main, jab vah sarkaar mahaj saat din chal saki thi, bijepi ke 67 vidhayakon ke mukaable nitish ke paas keval 34 vidhayak the
 But it was a different time
 bijepi ne junior partner ke taur par nitish kaa samarthan kiya tha, tab bhi faisle nitish ke hi hote the or bhagava saajheedaar parde ke peeche se kaam karte the
 But the game changes when Lalu is a coalition partner and also that big partner
 aane vaale dinon main, mumkin he mukhyamantri ko lage ki vidhansabha chunaav jeetna is khel kaa aasaan hissaa tha
 Now one of his most difficult challenges is to hold Lalu's storm with one hand and to overcome his central ambitions with the other

 The results revealed that women are less stressed in the office than in their home
 shodhakartaaon ne bataaya ki,mahilaayenophis main zyadakhushrahati hai
 While men are more happy in their home
 is study main alag-alag becoground se aae logon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 According to the researchers, the main reason for this is that when women are not satisfied with their jobs, they change their jobs and work where they feel good
 lekin purush aisa nahin karte hai
 Despite not being satisfied with their jobs, they continue to work in the same company, due to which they are not happy in the office
 study main ye bhi saamne aayaa ki kaamkaaji maataaon ko un mahilaon ke mukaable kam tanaav hota he jinke bachche nahin hote he
 In fact, researchers believe that women who have children have a good mood and reduce stress
 haalanki, is study ke nattejey har paristhiti main sahi sabit nahin hote hai, kyonki ye study kam hi logon par kii gai he
 Also, unmarried people have not been talked about in this study
 sirf shaadishuda logon par ye study kii gai he

 saath hi gramin bainkon ke liye bazaar se rakam jutaney ke prastaavon kaa sidhaa matlab he ki sarkaar in bainkon ko milane vaali madad band karne ke mood main he
 There is nothing special in this budget for laborers and farmers

 Employment will also be affected as there is not much incentive for domestic industry

 Apart from this, talking to mps, these issues will be raised during the debate on the budget

 Because the budget provision will fail completely to serve the farmers and their expectations and aspirations

 Akshay himself did not know about this until he was 20 years old
 sonam ko is umr main shuru hua tha periods, kaha- tension main rahati thisonam kapur aaj kal apni aane vaali film 'pedman' kaa pramotion kar rahi hai
 The film is based on the life of Runachalam Muruganatham, who designed a cheap sanitary napkin making machine for the women of the village
 pramotion ke dauraan sonam se unke pehle periods ke bare main poocha gaya
 BIGG BOSS: Shilpa's brother gave a response to Hina Khan on the 'call Girl' comment

 What has happened to you after all? kyon aap do pyaar karne vaale dilon ko milane nahin de rahe
 In the history of our Hindi films, who were the enemies of the hero-heroine, which you people have fallen behind in their lives
 kabhi prem chopra ne apni chatur chaalon se premiyon kii rahon main kaante vichhaae to kabhi mogambo khush hua to aashiquon kii jaan suukh gai
 Shakal also did not torture the two loving hearts
 praan sahab kaa intkaal hue abhi zyada din nahin gujarey hai, lekin bhagwaan maaf kare unke karmon ke kaaran aashiquon ke dilon se khub badduaen nikali hongi

 You have seen three films in recent times and here too you have removed the pain like a colic in the depths of the heart
 'ranjhna' dekhi yahaan puri film main heroin se chaante khate rahe hero ko jab apni premika mil sakati thi, thik usee samay par aapane use maar diya
 Love in the film 'lootera' once again rises, but before that, the writer has broken the tip of his pen like a judge of old films
 teesri film, jisane 'gajini' ke baad sabase zyada dukh diya vah thi 'aashiqui-2'
 Your eyes, intention and mind are all bad
 pehali vaali 'aashiqui' main saare dukh-dard jhelkar bhi ant main hero-heroin milte hai to har yuva ke dil main pyaar kaa phool khilne lagata he
 But where do you like the happiness of others? In 'aashiqui-2' everything was going well, Heroine was supporting the hero moment by moment, the hero had also promised to improve, but you dumped him in the sea
 dekhie aashiquon kii badduaen mat lijie
 Badgers of lovers are very bad
 kabir das kaa doha to suna hi hoga aapane- durbal ko na sataaie, jaki moti hai
 From the breath of my skin, the iron is consumed

 After Pratyusha's death, a shocking thing has come to light that when Pratyusha's corpse was taken down from the ceiling fan
 us vakt uske maathe par sindur laga hua tha
 The police and his friends were shocked when they saw the vermilion
 sabake saamne ek hi sawaal tha ki aakhir pratyusha ke maathe par shaadi se pehle sindur kyon laga tha
 What is the mystery of sindoor on Pratyusha's forehead
 pratyusha kii laash ko sabase pehle uske premi rahul raaj ne hi dekha tha
 And it was Rahul who reached the hospital with Pratyusha's body
 jabaki andheri west ilaake kii jis socity main pratyusha rahati thi, uske guard shrinath ke mutabik donon ke bich bahut jhagada hota tha
 Rahul is questioning the role of Raj Singh in this whole affair
 pratyusha ke saathi kalakaaron kaa maananaa he ki rahul raaj ko to vahaan nahin hona chahie tha

 Pratyusha's relationship with her boyfriend Rahul was not good

 com / 9infh9pcru— Manish Sisodia (@msisodia)july 16, 2019beete saal karikulam kaa udghaatan buddha dharmaguru dalai lamas ne kiya tha
 Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia had informed about the celebration by tweeting from his official Twitter handle
 unase meghalaya ke shiksha mantri ne bacchon se happines class main mulaakaat kii thi
 The Chief Minister has issued informal guidelines for ministers in the Kamal Nath government
 ise mantriyon ke liye code of conduct naam diya gaya he
 By the way, there are many rules in it which have been made for ministers
 lekin mantriyon ko media se sanbhalkar rahane kii salaah ne vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 While the Congress is calling it discipline on one hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has strongly criticized it
 madhya pradesh main 15 saalon ke baad satta main ai congress lagata he apane mantriyon ke bayanon or vyavhaar kii vajah se vivaadon main nahin aana chaahati
 Perhaps this is the reason why the Kamal Nath government has issued informal guidelines for all its ministers
 is guideline main mantriyon ko kai tarah kii salaah di gai he
 For example, how should they behave in public, journalists, public servants-officers or in public events and places
 lekin isi guideline main mantriyon ko ye bhi salaah di gai he ki patrakaron se sanbhalkar rahen
 Guidelines for Ministers: In this informal guideline, ministers have been told that journalists nowadays record conversations and statements from their mobile cameras
 isliye mobile kii maujuudagi main dhyaan se baatcheet karen
 Ministers have been asked to refrain from giving personal opinion on sensitive matters
 aapkaa bayaan vivaad paidaa kar saktaa he
 Media and opposing parties are looking for such opportunities
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki patrakaron se keval apane hi yaa staff ke phone se baat karen kyonki kai phone main automatic recording hoti he jiskaa baad main durupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Meet the journalists whenever they meet separately
 kaaryakartaaon yaa adhikariyon-karmchaariyon ke saamne patrakaron se naa milen
 The Public Relations Minister of the government has termed this guideline as the discipline of Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 unka kahana he ki train sidhi patari par chalati he tab tak thik rahati he varna durghatana ho jaati he
 Minister PC Sharma told 'azataj', 'kamal Nath ji is our head and he feels that he should be more positive because his own style of functioning is very clear
 vah kisi tarah ke vivaad main nahin padate
 There should be discipline as it is in everyone
 patrakaron se khauf nahin he, lekin lekin patrakaron se sanbhal kar baat karen yah to aapkaa sammaan badhaayaa he
 There should be no such thing that leads to the wrong message
 ham bas chaahate hai ki janata ke bich main acchhee chhavi rahe
 If the train runs straight away, if it gets there then it will become an accident
 'mantriyon ko jari guideline main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki unhe sanbhalkar bayaan dena he
 Stay in dignity in public places and do not share the stage with persons of criminal tendencies
 camere par bayaan dete vakt bhashaa kaa dhyaan rakhen or kam shabdon main apni baat rakhen
 Apart from this, it has been advised to avoid posting or forwarding the truth on social media
 bijepi ne saadhaa nishanaavahin bijepi ne mantriyon ke liye jari guideline par sarkaar ko aade haathon liya he
 Umashankar Gupta, who was a minister in the Shivraj government, said that there was no such restriction in his government
 sarkaar jab galat nahin he to media se baat karne main kyon kataraana
 Gupta said, 'these things have been said, there should be transparency in the government somewhere
 use rokane kii koshish kii gai he
 Banning journalists from talking is a big mockery of democracy
 bilkul taanaashaahee ravaiya apnaanaa chaahate hai aap jo bolnaa chaahate hai
 They all do not want to speak or tell the truth to the public
 aapako apane mantriyon par bharosa nahin he
 His conduct is not trusted
 agar aapkaa kaam paardarshee he, koi bhrasht aacharan nahin he to aap media se kyon kataraate hai
 In BJP, no minister was prohibited from speaking to the media, rather the Chief Minister himself said that he should remain in the middle of the media '
 kamalnath sarkaar main ye koi pehali baar nahin he jab mantriyon or media ke bich main diwaar khadi kii gai ho
 Earlier too, by issuing an order, only 7 out of 28 ministers were authorized by the government to talk to the media, which was also disputed
 vishwa bank ne kishanganga baandh vivaad par pakistan sarkaar se bharat ke prastaav ko sweekaar karne kii salaah di he
 Pakistan has taken the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration where India has proposed the appointment of an impartial expert
 ab vishwa bank kaa kahana he ki pakistan ko maamle main peeche hatate hue bharat ke prastaav ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 Pakistan has been consistently saying that the construction of the Kishanganga Dam is a violation of the Indus Water Agreement of 1960
 uski daleel he ki is pariyojna se na sirf pakistan main bahani vaali nadiyon kaa jal str prabhavit hoga balki nadiyon kii disha tak badal jaaegi
 For this reason, Pakistan has taken the matter to the International Court of Justice
 duusari ore bharat kaa maananaa he ki pakistan jo daleelein de rahaa hai vah mudde par sateek nahin baithti isi vajah se is maamle mennishpaksh visheshgyaki niyukti kii jaani chahie
 Sources have revealed that Pakistan is not ready to accept India's proposal in this matter
 kyonki use aisa lagata he ki isse vah internation court main apana paksh kho saktaa he or madhyasthata ke sabhi daravaaje band ho sakate hai
 Also, whenever any dispute arises between India and Pakistan in other matters, an attempt can be made to resolve the dispute through a similar impartial expert
 disambar 2016 main vishwa bank ke adhyaksh ne pakistan ko bataaya tha ki is maamle main dakhal ke liye philhal taiyaar nahin he
 Reacting to this, Pakistan reminded the World Bank of its role and said that it was not ready to stay on the issue
 pakistan ko lagata ki agar yah mudda lataka gaya to bharat itane vakt main kishanganga baandh ke nirmaan kaa kaam puraa kar legaa
 Recently, Pakistan objected to this even after the inauguration of the Kishanganga project on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin vishwa bank aapatti khaarij karte hue maamle mendkhal dene se inkaarkar diya tha
 Let me tell you that Pakistan has reached the World Bank, complaining about the project, accusing it of violating the 1960 Indus Water Agreement
 yahaan padosi mulk ne vishwa bank se is pariyojna kii nigaraanee rakhane ko kaha tha
 There was no consensus on this, but the World Bank has promised Pakistan that it will continue to talk to both countries on this issue

 Uddhav Thackeray, who had soaked a statue of Veer Savarkar at the North Campus of Delhi University, said that the public beating of those who insulted Savarkar, a respected person from Maharashtra, would understand the value of freedom
