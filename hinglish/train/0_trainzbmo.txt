 adaalat kii kaarywahi main hissaa lene ke liye salmaan apana kaam khatm karke mangalvaar ko mumbai pahunch gaye
 Salman, one of the most popular actors of Bollywood, has projects till 2017 and he has an investment of 200 crores from the industry
 court main suraksha hui kadiseshans court ke sutron ne bataaya ki police ne adaalat parisar main suraksha vyavastha kadi karne kii taiyaari kar lee he taaki salmaan ke phans ko parisar main aane se roka ja sake
 Sources said that only media persons, lawyers and court staff would be allowed inside the court

 ho sakati he 10 saal tak kii sajaais maamle main abhiyojan or bachaav paksh kii bahes 21 april ko puri ho gai thi
 The debate was renewed after the magistrate included charges of culpable homicide and sending the case to the sessions court
 gaiyr iradatan hatya ke maamleki sunwaayee magistrate nahin balki satr adaalat kar sakati he or doshi paae jane par apradhi ko 10 saal tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 Earlier, the magistrate was hearing a case against Salman for negligence and speeding
 is maamle main ipisi kii dhara ke tahat aaropee ko do varsh tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 Driver's testimony- i was driving the car
 Salsaman (49) says that he was not driving at the time of the accident and his driver Ashok Singh was driving at the time
 bachaav paksh ke gavaah ke rup main pesh hue singh ne is baat kii pushti kii he
 However, the prosecution led by Pradeep Gharat has alleged that Salman was driving after drinking 'bacardi Rum' from a bar while the actor says he was drinking water rather than alcohol
 haalanki abhiyojan ne daleel di ki car main salmaan ke alaava unka police body guard rabindra patil or gayak mitra kamaal khan maujuud the lekin abhinayta ne tark diya ki car main ek chauthaa vyakti ashok singh bhi tha
 In 2013, a court framed charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder during a fresh trial against Salman

 Government crane slashed on the victims SUV: Salman's lawyersalman's lawyer Srikanth Shivde argued that the post-mortem report of the deceased showed that he died of injuries from the crush and that the injuries were caused by the police
 The gone crane could not lift the heavy SUV at once and dropped it onto the victims
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne tark diya ki baayan pahiyaa fat jane ke kaaran car ek dukaan se takaraa gai thi
 He said that the road was being repaired near the shop at the accident site and stones were scattered at that place
 abhiyojan paksh ne kaha ki vah patil kii ore se police ko die gaye bayaan ko aadhaar bana rahaa he
 Patil had said that he had advised the actor not to drive at high speed and carelessness, but Salman did not listen to him
 patil kii sunwaayee ke dauraan maut ho gai thi
 Patil had also said that Salman had drunk alcohol at the time of the accident
 haalanki usne salmaan ke is daawey ke bare main kuch nahin kaha ki gaadi ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha
 Patil's testimony was argued separately by counsel for the lawman, saying that Patil's statement should be sidelined as he passed away and that he was not available for questioning while the prosecution argued that Patil's statement was considered Must go because he saw Salman driving the car and he was a key witness
 bachaav paksh ke vakil ne yah bhi tark diya ki police ne stearing wheel se ungaliyon ke nishaan nahin uthaae the, jisase yah pataa chal sake ki gaadi koun chalaa rahaa tha
 According to the prosecution, Nurullah Mehboob Sharif was killed and Kalim Mohammad Pathan, Munna Malai Khan, Abdullah Rauf Sheikh and Muslim Sheikh were injured due to Salman's negligence and speeding driving

 When the journalists asked them where do you have the evidence to prove these allegations, they raised their hands and said, 'I don't have evidence
 press conference main maujuud kasturba nagar se 'aap' vidhayak madanlaal ne daawa kiya ki unhen siem banane kaa laalach dekar 'aap' se 9 vidhayakon ko todane kii sajeesh kii gai
 He said that this conspiracy was done at the behest of BJP leader Arun Jaitley
 madanlaal ne kaha, 'saat disambar ko raat main ek aiesadi number se kol aayaa
 It was said that Arun Jaitley wants to talk to you
 lekin maine 'shat ap' kah phone band kar diya
 'he claims that in lieu of breaking the MLA from' AAP ', he was given Rs 20 crore and lured in the cm's chair
 madanlaal ne yah bhi kaha ki gujarat ke ek shaks ne unase is bare main sampark kiya tha
 Madanlal denied the allegations that he had held a meeting with Vinod Kumar Binny

 bhartiya cricket ke chamakate sitaron ke sammaan main paanch sitara hotel main raat ke bhavy jashn ke liye joshila jamaavada tay tha
 The bcci's annual awards ceremony, honoring the players for their outstanding performances on the field, provided an excuse for top officials of the world's most powerful cricket board to travel to Mumbai's business class and pat themselves on the back
 lekin janvari 5 kii us raat ko akad gaayab thi
 The smell of a strange plot was floating in the air
 desh ke cricket prashasan kii saaf-safai ke liye supreme court kii gathit nyaayamurti lodha ayog ne siforishein pesh kar di thim
 The Commission's report recommended a fundamental change in the structure and modalities of the Board of Control for Cricket in India
 us raat paanch sitara hotel ke haul main har kisi kii jubaan par ek hi sawaal thah ab aage kya hoga?haalanki bisisiai ke 87 varsh puraane itihaas main kai hichkole aae hai, lekin is baar kii chunauti sabase badi or nirnaayak honi tay he, jo duniya ke sabase dhani cricket board ke astitv par hi sawaal uthaa rahi he or use chunauti de rahi he

 Lodha submitted the report on 4 January, which was like a last setback for the BCCI already beset with questions

 And if Justice T

 If the Supreme Court bench headed by Thakur makes these recommendations binding for the BCCI, it will be like an unexpected chapter in Indian cricket
 yah apratyaashit isliye he, kyonki abhi zyada din nahin hue ki cricket kaa kaarobaar khaas logon ke club kii tarah berokatoke jari tha
 Apart from a few controversies, the IPL remained a mine for young talent and money making

 There was an atmosphere of applause, with Srinivasan leading the players by giving them pension and former international and domestic players with a one-time bonus
 or achaanak ve may 2013 main spot phixing ke vivaad main ulajh gaye
 His son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan was caught by the Mumbai police for betting and suspected spot-fixing, when Srinivasan made a terrible mistake by ignoring him
 agar unhone bisisiai pramukh ke naate ipiel aachaar samhita ke tahat chennai super kings ke khilaaf karrwai kii hoti, to cricket kaa khel unheen ke saath bana rahata
 First the Supreme Court, then the Mudgal Commission and finally when the Supreme Court got Justice Lodha to look into the entire functioning of the BCCI, it was as if the last nail was knocked in the coffin
 bisisiai se jude ek shaks ise cricket kii bhashaa main kehete hai: lodha kii gend par, shrinivasana ne kaich lapka or bisisiai out ho gaya
 He told India Today, "srinivasan should have read the writing on the wall long ago
 2013 main jab spot phixing ke maamle khule tab agar sirf unhone kanoonee karrwai ke prati ahankaar nahin dikhaaya hota, to hamen yah din nahin dekhnaa padataa
 They kept changing their maneuvers to maintain their power and now we are at the mercy of the Supreme Court
 ''lekin kya bisisiai ko vastav main is jatke kii jarurat he? puure maamle ko dekhne ke do tareeke hai
 Without BCCI veterans in the 1980s and 1990s, it would not have reached this stage today
 paise or rasookh main hui vruddhi ne na sirf bisisiai ke liye daanv bada kar diya, balki isane desh main cricket kaa str bhi badha diya
 But after the start of the financial success and IPL beating money, perhaps the BCCI has forgotten its main concern cricket
 kai vivaadon or en
 Srinivasan's dictatorial attitude probably led to BCCI spending more time and money in the courts
 haalanki philhal bisisiai kaa yahi kahana he ki, ''report ke adhyayan ke baad hi kuch kaha jayega'' lekin board acchhee tarah jaanata he ki iskaa matlab kya he
 On the occasion of the Mumbai event, BCCI President Shashank Manohar, himself a well-known legalist, was busy in meetings with senior officials
 aam sabha kii vishesh baithak jald hi bulaai jaaegi, uske pehle rajya sanghon ko 15 din kaa notice dena hoga
 Reports will also be sent to the state associations, they will be asked to make notes on it and then set up a committee to consider its feasibility
 manohar jaanate hai ki agar bisisiai ne lodha report ke aage apane ghutane tech die, to vishwa cricket main uskaa dabadabaa ghat jayega
 The board will not have trouble approving minor changes
 masalan, ipiel ko bisisiai se alag kiya jaae, nau sadasyon kii ek sarvocch parishad ke gathan kiya jaae or samooche tantra or vittiya lenden ko niyantrit karne ke liye ek mukhya kaaryakari adhikari kii niyukti kii jaae
 He would have no hesitation in endorsing any law to legalize betting or even in formation of sports associations
 lekin bisisiai ko artiai ke daayre main laane, ek rajya-ek vot, ek vyakti-ek pad, padaadhikari ke liye adhiktam 70 varsh kii aayu seemaa, padaadhikariyon ke kaarykaal kii seemaa tay karne or mantriyon or sarkari karmchaariyon ke bisisiai main padaadhikari banane par pratibandh jaise chah siforeeshon ko dur rakhane ke liye board kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 The bcci's dilemma is that it can neither reject all recommendations nor be in a position to accept select recommendations
 antat use sabhi siforeeshon ko maananaa pad saktaa he yaa phir vah kuch na maane, lekin lodha kii kanoonee haisiyat ko dekhte hue yah aasaan ladaai nahin he

 Lodha was very cautious in media interaction with Ravindran
 ''ham ek fori samaadhaan kii disha main ja rahe hote or bisisiai kaa niyantran sarkaar ko saunp dete, to is sab kii aavashyaktaa nahin rah jaati
 We wanted to maintain the autonomy of the BCCI and the most difficult challenge before us was that diseases needed to be treated
 '' lodha ne koi baat dabe-chhipe shabdon main nahin kii, isliye bisisiai ke diggajon ko inamen goodharth khojane kii jarurat nahin thi
 Lodha, who has never hesitated to say it clearly, has headed a bench in the Supreme Court that oversaw the CBI probe into the coal block allocation scam, which had canceled all 214 coal block allocations since 1993
 koyala ghotaale ke dauraan unhone hi sibiai ko 'pinjre kaa tota' kaha tha, jo bahut mashhoor ho gaya tha
 So, when they say that "cricket needs to be saved and i will assure that the sports lovers are not disappointed
" paardarshita or javabdehi laane ke liye puri koshish karuunga
 It would be difficult to ignore his words
 cricket premi chahenge ki khel saaf-suthra ho, lekin koi bhi yah nahin chahta he ki bharat kaa sabase lokapriy khel sarkari niyantran main rahe
 Unlike other sports federations, the BCCI is the only one, which is independent of government control
 mote paise ke alaava—abhi bhi vishwa cricket kii kamai kaa lagbhag 70 fisadi hissaa bharat se miltaa he
 a former BCCI president's question is, "do they also want to do the same to us as hockey or football associations that need the government's permission to send national teams to competitions?" Ajay Shirke, president of Maharashtra Cricket Association, who resigned as BCCI treasurer in protest against Srinivasan's way of handling a state-one vote form Questions the practicality of Prule
 masalan, maharashtra or gujarat donon main teen-teen association hai
 They ask, "who will get one vote from the three associations of Maharashtra, Mumbai, Maharashtra and Vidarbha?" How can you suddenly turn the 80-year-old association into an associate member? ”the National Cricket Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar under the patronage of the Mumbai Cricket Association has already called an emergency meeting on 13 January
 yah desh ke vibhinn konon main yojit kii jane vaali kai baithkon main se pehali baithak ho sakati he
 Pawar's intention may be to become the BCCI President again, which may have a 70-year age limit
 lagata he, philhal ke liye, bisisiai or uske rajyavar sahyogiyon ne nyaayamurti lodha dwaara phenki gai bodiline bounsar ko jhukkar guzar jane dene ko praathamikta di he
 But, as the saying goes, the last ball has not been thrown yet and the game will certainly continue till the last moment

 This becomes a reason for a settled settlement to go to desolation

 Due to darkness in the room, Charu came near her open window and bowed something and did not know what she was writing with great concentration
 amal chupchaap kab uske peeche aakar khadaa ho gaya, use pataa nahin chalaa
 She kept writing something in the light of the clouds
 amal use padhane laga
 Many of Amal's compositions were also open nearby
 charu ko apane lekhan ke liye ve hi adarsh lagati thim
 "you used to say, you can't write
 "achaanak amal kii upasthiti se chaaru buree tarah chaunk gayi
 He immediately hid his copy
 boli, "yah galat baat he!""isamen galat kya he?""chhipakar kyon dekh rahe the?"amal ne kaha, "tum phir dikhaati kahan ho?"charu ne apane likhe ko faadane kii koshish kii
 Amal quickly snatched the copy from her hand
 chaaru boli, "agar tumne isaki ek bhi pankti padhi to main tumse jivan-bhar ke liye kutti kar luungi
 "amal also said," If you stop reading, then i will also do a loot for a lifetime
 "chaaru boli, "devar ji, tumhen mere sir kii kasam! ise mat padho!"aakhirkaar chaaru ko hi haarana padaa, kyonki vah khud bhi amal ko apana likhaa dikhaane ke liye lalayit thi
 But he would not be so ashamed while showing it, he had not thought
 amal ne jab bade anunay ke baad use padhanaa shuru kiya, tab maare shame ke chaaru ke haath-paanv barf kii tarah thande ho gayi
 She said, "I will go and get a drink for you
 "kahkar vah bagal ke kamare main paan kaa bidaa banane ke liye chali gayi
 After reading the implementation, he went to Charu and said, "you have written very well
 "chaaru paan main kattha lagaana bhuulakar boli, "jaao, mujhase majaak karne kii jarurat nahin
 Return my copy "amal ne kaha, "'abhi nahin
 First, remove it clearly and send it to a magazine
 "chaaru boli, "patrika main bhejne kii jarurat nahin
 It's enough
 "chaaru ne kaaphi aapatti kii, magar amal nahin mana
 He repeatedly swore, "this is a very suitable composition for the magazine
 "chaaru badi hataasha se boli, " ab tumse ladane kii mujhase kshamta nahin he
 i know, if you stick to it, you will not accept it without completing it
 "amal ne kaha, "ek baar bhaiya ko bhi dikhaane kii jarurat he
 Hearing this, Charu stood unhappily, and tried to snatch that copy and said, "no, they don't need to show
" agar unhen mere likhane ke bare main kuch bataaya to phir main kabhi kuch nahin likhuungi
 "amal said," Sister-in-law, you are getting it wrong
 bhaiya munh se jo bhi kahen, ve tumhaara likhaa dekhakar bahut khush honge
 "charu Boli," whatever, i don't mean anything with his happiness
 "chaaru ne pratigya kii thi ki ek din vah bhi kuch likhakar amal ko chakit kar degi
 She would not leave without proving how different she was from Manda
 pichley kuch dinon se vah dher sara likhakar faad chuki thi
 Whoever sat down to write, could not get rid of the effect of implementation
 milakar dekhati to ek hi cheez ho jaati thi
 Even a part of Amal's article was included in his article
 sanyog se utana hi ansh acha tha, baaki bachakaana lagata tha
 Seeing this, Amal would surely laughed heartily, thinking that Charu tore it all down and threw it in the pond so that no piece of it would accidentally fall into Amal's hand
 pehle usne 'shravan kaa megh' likhaa tha
 He thought he had written a new thing full of emotions
 achaanak gaur karne par usne dekha ki vah rachana 'asadha kaa chandramaa' se buree tarah prabhavit thi
 Amal wrote - 'brother Moon, why are you roaming in the clouds like thieves?' Charu wrote- 'sakhi Kadambini, you suddenly don't know where you are coming from and stealing the moon under your blue flame! / adi-adi
 'kisi tarah se bhi amal ke prabhaav se mukt na ho paane se chaaru ne rachana kaa vishay hi badal diya chandramaa, badal, shefali, bahu katha kaho, aadi vishay chhodkar usne 'kalitla' naam se ek niabandh likhaa
 In his village there was a Kali temple on the banks of the pond in the darkness of the shade of trees
 us mandir ko lekar bachapan kii kalpana, bhay, utsukata aadi smritiyontthaa us jaagrit devi ke mahatmaya ke bare main gaanv main prachlit pracheen kinvadantiyon aadi ko lekar usne ek niabandh taiyaar kiya
 Her debut was somewhat poetic like Amal's, but later she was written in a different style with a simple and vernacular break
 usee lekh ko amal ne chhinakar padhaa tha
 Initially, the essay was quite succulent, but that uniformity could not be maintained till the end
 jo bhi ho, pehali rachana ke taur par lekhika kaa praytn prashansaneey tha
 Charu said, "dewar ji, let us also get a monthly magazine
 kya kehete ho?"amal ne kaha, "bina dher saare paison ke yah kaise chal paayegi?"chaaru boli, "is patrika main koi kharch nahin hoga
 We will not print it, we will write it by hand
 usamen hamaare-tumhaare alaava or kisi kii rachana nahin rahegi
 Will not let anyone read it
 sirf do pratiyaan niklengi ek tumhaare liye, ek mere liye
 "had it been a few days before, Amal would have jumped from this proposal
 ab gopneeyata kaa utsaah usamen khatm ho gaya tha
 It was no longer a pleasure to write without reading from others
 phir bhi pichley dinon kaa thaath banaaye rakhane ke liye usne kaha, "thik he, yah to bade maje kii baat hogi
 "charu Boli," but you have to promise that apart from our magazine, you will not publish your work anywhere else
 "amal ne kaha, "tab to sampadak meri jaan hi le lenge
 "charu said," and what weapon cannot come in my hands? "the same thing happened
 do sampadak, do lekhak or do pathakon kii cameti ban gayi
 Amal said, "the four texts will name the magazine
 "chaaru boli, "nahin iskaa naam 'amala' hoga
 "in this new busyness, Charu forgot the grief and grief of a few days in between
 uski masik patrika main manda ke ghusane kaa koi jariya nahin tha or usamen bahari vyaktiyon ke liye pravesh bhi band tha

 Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap believes that people get free after marriage, who come and go wherever they feel like coming and going
 jab tak shaadi nahin hoti he, tab tak sabko mata-pita ke under main rahanaa padataa he
 This is the thinking of Bihar's Health Minister and RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav and son of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi
 upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadavako watsape par mili shaadi ke dheron ofron par jab tej pratap se sawaal kiya gaya, to unhone yahi kaha ki yang or dianemic log sarkaar main kaam kar rahe hai
 That's why his younger brother is getting so many marriage proposals
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri or tej pratap yadav ke chote bhai tejasvi yadav ko watsape par 44 hajaar se adhik shaadi ke ofer ladakiyon ne bheje hai
 Tejashwi Yadav is also the Minister of the Road Construction Department
 unhone vibhaag kii taraf se ekwatsepanumber jari kiya tha, taaki kharaab sadakon kii tasviir log vibhaag ko bhej saken, lekin us par kharaab sadakon se zyada ladakiyon ke massej the, jisamen ladakiyon ne apane bare main bataate hue tejasvi se shaadi ke prastaav die hai
 Tejashwi Yadav himself is taken aback by this proposal of girls
 tejasvi ke bade bhai auraswasthya mantri tej pratapyadav bhi kunvaare hai, lekin unki shaadi par koi sawaal hi nahin puch rahaa he
 When reporters questioned the marriage proposal of Tejashwi Yadav, he replied that both our brothers are still under their parents and our parents will decide our marriage
 ham abhi janata kaa kaam kar rahe hai or log jaan rahe hai ki yang or dianemic log abhi sarkaar main kaam kar rahe hai
 This is why the brother has received so many marriage proposals
 uttar pradesh main yadav parivaar main chal rahe uthaa-patake par apni pratikriya dete hue tej pratap ne kaha ki kisi party main khit-pit nahin hoti he
 Such things have happened in our party, also in BJP and it happens in all parties and there is reconciliation at the time of elections
 unka maananaa he ki samaajawaadee party main bhi sulah ho jaaegi
 The public knows which party to vote for and whose government to form
 yah ek aitihaasik jalsa tha, jo deshbhar se lakhanu tasharif laae takreeban 300 shaayaron or lekhakon kii ek saath maujuudagi se roshan ho rahaa tha
 The host was hosted by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who was all set to distribute the awards of Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy for the first time at his government residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow
 mukarrar taarikh 4 agast ko yojit is jalse kii sadaarat muslim vakf or alpsankhyak kalyaan vibhaag ke cabinet mantri mohammad ajam khan ko kerani thi
 As soon as the clock of 11 in the morning of the needles started the fixed time of the prom, but Azam Khan did not come
 unki lokation lee jaati rahi or logon ko roke rakhane ke liye shero-shaayari kaa daur bhi chalata rahaa
 As the wait of the watches grew longer, the discomfort was increasing in the prom
 aakhirkaar aagantukon ke sammaan kaa lihaaj karte hue mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne paune do ghante baad ajam khan kii gairmaujuudagi main hi shaayaron or lekhakon ko puraskaar baant die
 Although earlier chairman of Urdu Academy Nawaz Deobandi pointed out the reason for Azam Khan's absence in the gestures, saying that the lion from the stage must have been a compulsion, there is no infidelity
 vajahon kii kadikhaan aapas main judi hui hai
 Hours before the start of Jalsa, the government agreed to postpone the proposed Shia Waqf Board election on August 12
 yah maang shiya moulana kalbe javwaad kii ore se uthi thi or sweekaar bhi ho gai
 Suddenly, this attention received by Maulana Javvad, Azam Khan chose to express his displeasure at the same well-known method of absence which he has tried on several occasions during the last two years
 haalanki ajam khan ne apane na aane kii vajah kuch or hi bataai
 In a way of giving some clarification, he said that he could not come on time in the program due to the delay in coming from Allahabad to Lucknow via road
 lekin jo log unke rajnatik tewaron se parichit hai, ve ise mahaj ek sanyog nahin qaraar de rahe hai
 The rigging in the election The ongoing tussle between Azam Khan and Jawwad has taken a violent form in the wake of allegations of rigging in the Waqf Board election
 25 july ko alavida kii namaaj ke baad kalbe javwaad kii aguai main pradarshnakariyon ke hujum ne ajam khan ke vikramaditya maarg par maujuud sarkari awaas ko gherne ke liye kooch kar diya tha
 When the police tried to stop them from moving ahead, a violent clash that lasted six hours on both sides killed one person and injured hundreds
 asal main shiya vakf board pradesh main jin 8,000 sampattiyon kii dekharekh apane mutavalli (trustee) ke madhyam se karata he, unki anumaanit keemat 50 lakh karod ru
 Sits more than that
 yahi vajah he ki in sampattiyon par kabje ke liye shiya vakf board jang kaa maidan ban gaya he
 (illegal occupation of Waqf land in Kala Imambara area of lucknow) Syed Faizi, 35, of Talkatora Waqf in Halatlankhanu, spoiled by voter list, has been named in the board's voter list for the last two times, but when the latest list was released on August 3 If it happened, his name was missing
 faiji kehete hai, ''pradesh main 8,000 se zyada vakf hai, lekin inamen se keval 25 ko hi voter banaaya gaya he
 Whereas in previous elections this number used to be close to 50
 ” shiya vakf board main chairman samet kul 13 sadsy hote hai or inkaa chunaav do charnon main hota he
 In the first phase, two Mutavalli are elected as members in the board
 iske chunaav main vahi mutavalli vot de sakate hai, jinke vakf kii salanaa kamai ek lakh ru
 Be more than
 4 agast ko chunaav prakriya shuru hone ke ek din pehle jaise hi vakf board kii nai voter list jari hui, may, 2012 ko vakf board ke bhang hone ke baad teesri baar ghoshit hue chunaav bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii bhent chadh gaye
 The eminent waqf of the state is Amiriya Madrasa Amdia Mahmudabad, Waqf Imambara Syed Ali Kabir of Meerut, Waqf Sajjadia Karim and Jadid of Lucknow, Waqf Haji Sheikh Afzal Hussain are among the list of two dozen Waqf whose Mutawallis are participating in the election this time
 have stopped
 jabaki in sabhi vakfon kii salanaa aamadani kai lakh rupye thaharti he
 This disturbance in the voter list has given the Shia cleric Kalbe Jawwad another weapon to surround Azam Khan
 javwaad kehete hai, ''ajam khan ne board main apane kareebi or purv chairman wasim rizvi ko dobaaraa chairman banane ke liye manamafik voter list taiyaar karai he
 "they allege that Azam Khan is seizing his men in the board because he is afraid of opening up the investigation into the rigging of the Waqf properties
 haalanki alpsankhyak vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari in saare aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 He says, "most of the waqf is a large part of the income of charity
 chunki daan se hui aay ko shudgh aay main nahin joda jaataa, isliye board ke nirdhaarit maapdand main kaaphi kam vakf shaamil ho rahe hai
 "maulana Kalbe Jawwad's war against corruption spread over ten years of Jungsia Waqf properties started 10 years ago
 varsh 2003 main jab mulaayam singh yadav mukhyamantri bane to vakf mantri ajam khan kii sifarish par purv sapa saansad mukhtaar anis ko shiya central vakf board kaa chairman banaaya gaya
 Maulana Kalbe Jawwad strongly opposed the sale of a Waqf property in Hazratganj, Lucknow during Anees's tenure
 moulana ke talkh rukh par mukhtaar anis ko board ke chairman pad se hatana padaa tha
 After this, in 2004, former SP councilor Wasim Rizvi, close to Maulana Kalbe Jawwad, became the chairman of the board
 lekin uske baad 2007 main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad mayawati kii sarkaar banane ke baad rizvi bispi main shaamil ho gaye
 In 2009, the Shia Central Waqf Board completed its five-year term
 chunaav ke baad jab nae board kaa gathan hua to moulana kalbe javwaad kii sahmati se unke bahanoi jamaluddin akbar ko chairman banaaya gaya or is board main wasim rizvi sadsy chune gaye
 It was also from here that the political war between Wasim Rizvi and Maulana Kalbe started
 ek saal baad 2010 main board par bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hue tatkaaleen chairman pro
 Jamaluddin Akbar resigned and thereafter Wasim Rizvi once again held the post of Chairman of Shia Waqf Board
 2012 main sapa sarkaar banane ke do maheene baad 28 may ko vakf board ko bhang kar diya gaya
 Under the influence of Kalbe Jawad, the government handed over the investigation of illegal occupation of Waqf properties to CB-CID
 pichley varsh 29 disambar ko sibi-siidi ne paanch jilon main dhaandhlee ujagar karte hue wasim rizvi samet kul 11 logon par exiar darj kara di
 Even seven months later, angry with the arrest of the accused, Kalbe Jawwad alleges, "the demand for a CBI probe into the occupation of Waqf is a pretense of Azam Khan
 ve sibi-siidi jaanch main fanse hue apane kareebi logon ko bachaa rahe hai
 “the opening of the trial by investigation is the historic Kala Imambara in Pir Bukhara area of chowk, two kilometers from Bada Imambara in Dirkhanloo
 iske ahaate main faili hui 10 bigha jameen vakf kii he
 Some societies occupied and plotted this land and now the entire locality has been settled here

 Here the land mafia got noticed on the cemetery built on 25 bigha land of Waqf
 phir kya tha, pichley 25 saal main dhire-dhire kabristaan kii 10 bigha jameen kii plotting karke use bech daalaa gaya
 This business of grabbing Waqf properties is going on with full vigor not only in Lucknow, but all over the state
 agar keval rajdhani lakhanu kii hi baat karen to aazaadee ke samay yahaan par kul 46 shiya kabristaan the, lekin is vakt keval 15 hi bache hai
 The remaining 31 cemeteries have been secretly occupied and illegal colonies have been established there
 vakf sampattiyon par ho rahe avaidh kabje ke khilaaf lard rahi sanstha 'husaini tigers’ ke adhyaksh shamil shamsi bataate hai ki vakf sampattiyon kii dekharekh karne vaale kai mutavalliyon ne inaki jameen ko bechney main bhrashtachar kiya he
 a large number of Waqf properties have been 'deleted' with Azam's connivance
 shamsi kehete hai, ''vakf sampattiyon par kabje kii sibiai jaanch se 20,000 karod ru
 Scam of more than can be revealed
 isi ghotaale ko khulne se bachaane ke liye ajam khan board par apane samarthakon ko kabiz karwaanaa chaahate hai
 “this sequence of allegations and counter-allegations is not one sided
 tali donon haathon se baj rahi he
 Without denying the allegations leveled against him and naming Kalbe Jawwad, Azam Khan says, "the religious leaders wanted their brother-in-law to be the chairman of the Shia Waqf Board
" ve sitambar, 2013 ko is silsile main mujhase milane mere awaas par bhi aae the
 i refused to help him in this matter
 isliye ab ve anargal aarope laga rahe hai
 "azam Khan says that the black religious attire is actually trying to sell Islam
 kalbe javwaad ke paas ajam khan ke aaropon kaa jawaab taiyaar he
 Presently, he is working to prepare a roadmap for a big demonstration in Lucknow in the coming days at his residence in Chowk
 ve ajam khan ke aaropon par tikhi pratikriya dete hue kehete hai, ''quran-e-majid main jhooth bolne par laanat he
 Say this, Azam with his hands on the quran-e-majeed
 agar ham jhuthe honge to amama utaar denge or agar ve jhuthe hai to apana ohada chhod den
 "however, those who brought into existence Waqf properties by donating with the intention of helping the poor and the helpless, may not have anticipated that these properties would later become the battleground of dominance and politics among some

 ek skool ke bheetar ek vyakti par tendue dwaara kiye gaye hamale kaa video internet par viral ho gaya he, lekin jis biologist sanjay gabbi par hamalaa karata yah tendua nazar aa rahaa he, unka kahana he ki vah is baat se khush hai ki hamalaa un par kiya gaya
 Currently undergoing treatment at the hospital, and awaiting surgery on Saturday, Sanjay told ndtv's Agenda, "imagine the mother who is watching her son being attacked on TV
 
 
 mujhe aise halaat se nipatane kii training hasil he, lekin agar vah tendua mujh par hamalaa nahin karata, to ho saktaa he, vah campus main kahin or chalaa jaataa, or kisi or par hamalaa karata
 
 
 So, i am happy (he attacked me)
 
 
 " His legs were bitten in the attack, but according to officials, one of the leopard's sharp teeth was broken, so the attack was not as dangerous as it could have been
 tippaniyan Sanjay Gabbi is trained for this, and the Forest Department on Sunday invited him to the Vibgyor School to catch the leopard
 pichley do dashakon se yahi kaam karte aa rahe sanjay ne kuch or log maange the va kuch prakriyaaon kaa paalan karne ke liye kaha tha, lekin vaisaa nahin kiya gaya
 Talking to NDTV, Sanjay said, "I said section 144 should be imposed (so that people do not crowd around the school), fire brigade personnel are called, ambulance is called
 
 
 " sanjay ko is baat kii bhi chintaa thi ki tendua behosh kiye jane par swimming pool main girakar dub na jaae, isliye unhone use khaali karne ke liye bhi kaha tha
 The thing that troubled Sanjay the most was the presence of the media because it caused panic and the leopard became cautious
 unhone bataaya, "main unase peeche hatane or baahar jane ke liye kehane kii koshish kar rahaa tha, lekin phir tendua aa gaya, or khalabali much gai
 
 
 " unhone kaha ki jahaan is prajati kaa koi pashu gum rahaa ho, vahaan bheed lagaana yaa camere lekar aana us pashu ko kahin zyaada khatarnaak bana detaa he

 Weak evidence was introduced
 ab yahaan yah ek baat samajhane or poochne laayak he
 Why didn't the Sangh demand an inquiry into Sunil Joshi's murder? Why did the case be closed? Why didn't the BJP government get justice for Sunil Joshi's murder? Why did the then Sangh chief and then Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat not ask for the murder of his pracharak before the case was closed for investigation and now he is not seeking an appeal in the High Court

 Is there no violence in the history of Buddhism? Is there no violence and no war in civilizations that follow Christianity and Islam? Do not panic? Is the definition of terror free from murder and violence? The Prime Minister of India could have defended Pragya Singh Thakur politically

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki unke ek vichaarvaan bayaan ke kilaaf sonia gandhi ko saarvajanik rup se bayaan jari karnaa pad jayega
 Through an e-mail issued in English, Sonia Gandhi has stated in a very strict tone that the Congress talks of maintaining the caste-based reservation of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward as they have faced discrimination for centuries
 sonia ne kaha he ki sonia gandhi kisi ko obisi, essi, asti ke aarakshan par congress ke stand ko lekar na to shankaa honi chahie na bhram
 The Congress had implemented it, the Congress is trying to strengthen it further and the Congress will be at the forefront of continuing it
 aarakshan par jon jaani janardan ke mood main aae janardan dvivedi kaa vichaar bahes kii mez tak bhi nahin pahunch sakaa
 Today, when the opposition raised the matter in the Rajya Sabha, the government and the Congress made a distance in the morning
 darasal yahi hona bhi tha
 Congress or BJP can never speak out against reservation as a party
 jo log ekaadh netaaon ke aarakshan virdohi bayaan sunakar khush ho jate hai, unhen kuch din or samvidhan or samaaj kaa adhyayan karnaa chahie
 This idea did not come for the first time from Janardan ji either
 sonia kaa bayaan to shaam ko aayaa, lekin subah se lekar shaam ke bich tamaam aalochanaon ke baad bhi dvivedi ji apane vyaktigat vichaar par ade hue the
 Even today, he said that those for whom reservation has been done did not benefit
 ye sawaal garibi kaa he, uski koi jaat nahin hoti
 The case of objection is related to politics
 mayawatiji is desh kii badi netaa hai, lekin agar aap gaur se dekhen to bahujan se lekar sarvajan tak kii unki yatra kya he, wo samay ke saath drushtikon kaa parivartan he
 On the other hand, as soon as Mayawati condemned the statement of Janardan Dwivedi to the Congress as private, he also raised some questions with the Congress
 kya desh main essiasti obisi ke log in teenon maapdandon main forverd ho gaye hai kya kaaphi advance ho gaye hai, kya kaaphi viksit ho gaye hai, main samajhati hum, nahin hue hai
 After the statement of Congress MP PL Punia, Sonia, if you were in prime time today, you would have seen the edge of her words
 vaise kal ve dvivedi ji kii varishthata kaa aadar karte hue bhi kai tareeke se saafe kar chuke the ki yah bayaan thik nahin he
 PL Punia said that it has also been strongly condemned in the meeting of SC and ST mps Forum today
 jati ke aadhaar par aarakshan se koi samjhauta nahin he, baaki jo karnaa he kare
 He also said that the Congress High Command has been demanded to take action
 bijepi ke ravishankar prasad ne vahi kaha jiskaa mujhe andeshaa tha
 The essence of Ravi Shankar's statement seemed to be that Janardan Dwivedi made this statement to implicate the BJP
 unhone kaha ki rahul sonia ke bhaashan likhane vaale janardan dvivedi ke bayaan ko gambhirtha se liya janaa chahie
 a new trial balloon has been dropped, as Narendra Modi comes from a very backward class, knowing that a new debate is being tried
 ise ham uchit nahin maanate hai
 The relationship between Narendra Modi being backward and Dwivedi ji talking about reservation on caste basis was not very clear, but according to him, the Congress, which is facing corruption charges, has tried to start a new debate
 vaise pichley saal thik isi din yani 5 farvari ke financial times main bijepi ke mahasachiv varun gandhi kaa bayaan chapa he, jisamen ve kah rahe hai ki naukariyon main anusuchit jati−janajati ke aarakshan ko samaapt kar diya janaa chahie, kyonki yah aam janata ke hit ke kilaaf he or yogya ke adhikaar kaa hanan he
 It was not clear from the newspaper report where Varun had opposed the reservation
 kair iske ek maheene baad ve bijepi ke mahasachiv ban gaye
 a video of Narendra Modi speaking in English has been put on youtube in July 2013
 is video main modi bhaashan nahin de rahe balki nijee baatcheet jaise prasang main kah rahe hai ki sabhi ke liye shiksha kii suvidha ho to aarakshan koun maangega
 If there are jobs for everyone, then who will ask for reservation? hamen bahutayaat ke daur 'era aaf planti' kaa srijan karnaa hoga
 Then no one will ask for reservation
 ye samay kii barbaadi he
 BJP supports reservation
 akali dal kii saansad harsimrat cor badal ne bhi kaha he ki ve bhi isaki himaayat karti hai, magar congress das saal se kahaan thi
 However, the Akali Dal has been demanding inclusion of Jat Sikh in the OBC reservation
 udhar, baba ramdev kehete hai ki aadarneey janardan dvivedi ji ne pehali baar ek acchhee baat boli he
 There are still some good men left in the Congress who are daring to tell the truth, Dwivedi ji has done the same thing that reservation should be done on the basis of economic and not on the basis of caste
 to kya baba ramdev bijepi ke bheetar bhi janardan dvivedi sa sach bolne kaa saahas karne vaala dhundh nikaalenge yaa sab apana apana nijee bayaan dekar hi gaayab ho jaaenge
 Today's debate is an extension of Tuesday's debate
 aaj bhi ham jatigat aadhaar or aarthik aadhaar ko lekar baat karte hue arakshit siton kii raajnneeti par baat karenge
 In prime time
 
 
 baba kedarnath ke aashirwad or kedarpuri ke punarnirmaan se khwaahish to jameen thos or pukhta kar lene kii rahi hogi, lekin ghar main hi kalah foot padi
 Not one but two became the cause of discord
 donon hi centre or rajya main sattarudh bhaajapa ke do sarvocch netaaon ke sandesh or aadesh se sambandhit hai
 One, there is a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pay attention to a junior minister while laying the foundation stone for five reconstruction works in Kedarnath on 20 October
 doosraa, bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa vah aadesh he ki uttarakhand main party ke santhnik jilon kii sankhya 23 se ghataakar 14 kar di jaae
 Therefore, there is a panic in both the organization and the government of the state BJP
 darjanon bade-chote netaa or kaaryakarta khulkar naaraazgi jaahir karne lage hai
 Many leaders are anticipating that this rift within the government and the party organization may prove to be a hindrance for the bjp's Mission 2019
 pichley dinon amit shah uttarakhand daure par aae to bhaajapa ke santhnik jilon ko khatm karke unhen prashasnic jilon kii tarah hi baantne kaa aadesh suna diya
 In fact, in view of the heterogeneous geographical conditions of Uttarakhand, the BJP had separated the distribution of districts from the administrative districts to make the organization effective
 lekin bhaajapa adhyaksh ko yah nahin rucha
 So, now the bjp's 23 organizational districts were scrapped and made 14 districts
 13 prashasnic jilon ke alaava dehradun ko mahanagar ke rup main alag jile kaa darja mila
 The names of new district heads were also announced
 aise main jo pad se hataae gaye yaa jahaan pad hi khatm ho gaye, vahaan naaraazgi foot padi
 Then during the visit of Kedarnath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of some projects related to the Navnirman of Kedarpuri
 lekin aadharshila ke shilapat main vibhageeya mantriyon kii jagah pehali baar jitkar aae rajyamantri dow
 The name of Dhan Singh Rawat was excavated
 baadh or sinchai ke saath hi paryaton or tirthaton mahakme ke mantri satpal maharaj or yahaan tak ki saansad, purv mukchaymantri bhuvanchandra khandudi tak ko nazarandaaj kar diya gaya
 However, state BJP president Ajay Bhatt says that the name in the Shilapat is not an issue that should be so serious about it
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘jin nirmaan kaaryon ke shilapat pradhanmantri ne lagaae, unka kharchaa sarkari khajaane se na hokar kuch nijee sansthaanon or puunjipatiyon ne uthaaya he
 In such a situation, the government protocol does not apply to this proposed construction
 ’’ ve yah bhi bataate hai ki deepawali kaa mauka hone se vahaan bahut kam netaa or mantri gaye
 His consent was reached on the last day
 ‘‘satpal maharaj or khandudi kaa bhi vahaan jane kaa kaarykram tay nahin tha
 Dhan Singh Rawat was entrusted with all the preparations for the Prime Minister's visit, so his name was inserted in the inscription
 ’’lekin asantosh gaharaata dekh damege control shuru kiya gaya
 Calling Shilapat the fault of government officials, Chief Secretary S
 ramasvami or paryaton sachiv minakshi sundaram kii bali le lee gai
 Utpal Kumar Singh, who went on central deputation, has been replaced as Chief Secretary
 darasal dhan singh ravat abivipi se lekar sangh ke prachaarak rah chuke hai
 Party leaders say that the gift of Rawat's close association with the Prime Minister and Union Ministers is being given to him, as has been the case with Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 kuch yah bhi kah rahe hai ki satpal maharaj ko congress se aane or khandudi ko bujurgiyat kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 The rest of the ministers and leaders from the Congress have also become suspicious
 udhar, party sanghathan ke maamle main amit shah ke faisle se or bhi hadakamp machaa he
 a senior party leader, who did not wish to be named, said, "it is a failure of the state leadership that it has not been able to convince the national president that the decision to reduce the districts is wrong
" yah faisla jameen par party kii pakad kamjor karegaa
 Here, BJP workers were trying to increase the district from 23 to 27
 naubat party ke bheetar vidroh tak kii aa gai he
 "now the central leadership of the BJP has started a campaign to pacify it
" khabar he ki ruthe or pad se hataae gaye logon ko sarkaar main kuch nai jimmedaari mil sakati he
 But its effect is also seen to be reversing because after this assurance, there may be increased anger among the activists who played an important role in winning the BJP
 unhen ummid thi ki unhen kuch jimmedaari saunpi jaaegi
 Then PM Narendra Modi said that after the disaster in Kedarnath in 2013, when he asked to hand over the work of Kedar reconstruction to Gujarat, there was a disturbance in the central government at that time
 is par purv mukhyamantri harish ravat ne fouran palatwaar kiya, ‘‘bajaae congress ko is maamle main ghaseetne ke tab ke mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ab bhaajapa main hi hai, piem ko unase poochna chahie
 But the real challenge of the BJP is to deal with internal rebellion
 uttari kashmir ke bandipura jile main do haivaanon ne ek goongi-baheri naaballig ladki ko apni havas kaa shikaar bana liya
 The incident was carried out by the accused when the girl went to fetch wood from the outskirts of the village
 maamla bandipura jile ke lankarishipura gaanv kaa he
 a police officer said that the girl was picking wood in Lankarishipura village on October 4
 aarope he ki usee dauraan aarif or adil naamak do shaks vahaan pahunch gaye or unhone ladki ko akelaa paakar uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 a police officer said that a case was registered in this regard on the complaint of the girl's father
 jiske baad police ne mangalvaar ke din donon aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 According to police, the medical examination of the girl confirmed the rape
 adhikari ne bataaya ki donon aropiyon ke khilaaf dhara 376 or ranbir dand samhita ke tahat maamla darj kar liya gaya he

 Shah will try 'johar Jan Aashirwad Yatra' to try to feed lotus on the seats of Agasanthal, the formal announcement of the assembly election of BJP-65 plus in Narayan Jharkhand has not been done yet, but political parties are busy fixing their political fort

 Raghuvar Das is embarking on a 'johar Jan Ashirwad Yatra', which will be flagged off by BJP President Amit Shah, to take the achievements of his five-year tenure door-to-door
 mukhyamantri raghuvar das 19 se 24 sitambar tak santhal ke sabhi chah jilon kii yatra karenge
 In Santhal, through the Johar Jan Ashirwad Yatra, we will try to cover all the 18 assembly constituencies of the region
 yah ilaaka adivasee bahul mana jaataa he or jharkhand mukti morcha kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, this journey of BJP is considered very important
 bataa den ki bijepi 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main santhal pargana main bahut behatar nahin kar saki thi
 This is the reason why CM Raghuvar Das has made a strategy to give special attention to the seats of Santhal Parganas area in the initial phase of his 'johar Jan Ashirwad Yatra'

 These results, judging by the assembly seats, show that the NDA coalition had an edge over 63 seats (57 BJP and 6 AJSU) in a total of 81 assembly segments
 bijepi loksabhaa chunaav ke isi trend ko aadhaar banaakar vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye 65 siton kaa lakshya tay karte hue 'abaki baar 65 paar' kaa naaraa bhi diya he

 In such a situation, everyone's eyes are fixed on the JDS
 trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti bani to?jedies kosbhi agsit polmein 30 se 35 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 In such a situation, both BJP and Congress may need JDS to reach the magic figure of 112 seats required for majority
 ab sawaal ye he ki jedies inamen se kiske saath janaa pasand karegi? iske liye janata dal secular kii siyasat ko samajhane kii jarurat he

 pichley chunaavon main kya rahi thi jedies kii sthitikarnataka main jedies alag astitv main he to kerala main left democratic front kaa hissaa
 The JDS has formed a government with both Congress and BJP

 congress se devgauda kaa he purana conectiongedies kii sthapana echdi devgauda ne 1999 main janata dal se alag hokar kii thi
 The roots of the Janata Dal begin with the Janata Party formed against the Congress in 1977
 isi main se kai dal or netaaon ne baad main janata dal banaai
 In Karnataka, the command of the Janata Dal was in the hands of Dev Gowda
 unheen ke netritv main janata dal ne 1994 main purna bahumat ke saath sarkaar banaai or devgauda mukhyamantri bane
 Politics changes in politics: After two years, in 1996, as the leader of the Janata Dal, HD Deve Gowda was the Prime Minister of the country for 10 months
 isse pehle agar jaakar dekhen to 1953 main devgauda ne apni siyasat kii shuruyaat bhi congress netaa ke rup main hi kii thi, lekin pehali baar wo nirdaleey ke taur par vidhayak bane the
 Then during the Emergency, JP joined the Movement and joined the Janata Dal
 bijepi ke saath bhikarnatakamein banaai sarkardevgauda ke bete echdi kumaraswami rajya main bijepi ke samarthan se bhi sarkaar chalaa chuke hai
 After the 2004 elections, the Congress and the JDS formed a government and Dharam Singh of the Congress became the CM
 lekin 2006 main jedies gathbandhan sarkaar se alag ho gai
 Kumaraswamy then became CM in January 2006 as part of a turn-around agreement with the BJP
 lekin agle saal satta bijepi ko saunpane kii jagah kumaraswami ne oktober 2007 main rajyapal ko istipha bhej diya
 After which the state came under President's rule
 haalanki, baad main jedies ne bijepi ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya

 Yeddyurappa became CM for 7 days
 2008 se alag hai raste2008 ke chunaav main jedies-bijepi alag-alag chunaav maidan main utre or bijepi ne purna bahumat kii sarkaar banaai
 Congress won in 2013 and Siddaramaiah became CM
 2014 main centre main modi sarkaar ke banane ke baad secular politics kii charchaa chali to jedies ne apni siyasat main phir badlaav kiya
 On 14 April 2015, JDS and 5 other parties JDU-RJD-SP-INLD and Sajapa announced the anti-bjp New Janata Party Pariwar alliance
 lekin baad main bihar main argedy-jediu alag ho gaye or janata parivaar ke is gathbandhan ko lekar bhi koi thos pahal saamne nahin ai
 Mamta gave the advice to the Congress, the day the Karnataka elections were announced, the same day West Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress Chief Mamata Banerjee appealed to the Congress that Deve Gowda is a good person and to defeat the BJP in Karnataka, the Congress should be from the JDS Should join hands
 usee din parade ke peeche kai mulaakaaten bhi huin
 Devgowda also invited the Congress to come together
 lekin kuch hi ghanton main devgauda or kumaraswami ne you-turn le liya or gres-bijepi se kisi bhi gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko nakaarne lage
 The JDS formed an alliance with the BSP and NCP and contested the elections with the support of Owaisi's party
 yaheen se congress or jedies main talkh bayaanbaji shuru hui jo aaj tak thami nahin he
 The reason for the same vote bank congress-jds issue is that the JDS is a threat to the Congress because it can only harm Muslim, Dalit votes
 isliye congress jedies ko bijepi kii bi team sabit karne main juty rahi
 Experts say that the alliance between jds-congress was not natural
 rajya kii 60-65 siton par congress or jedies main sidhaa muqabla he
 When Rahul Gandhi called JDS bjp's B-team, BJP showed a soft attitude
 bijepi kii reliyon main jahaan congress par khulkar waar hua vahiin jedies par zyada kuch nahin bolaa gaya
 PM Modi himself said at a rally in Karnataka that Rahul Gandhi should not insult a senior leader like Deve Gowda
 ye ahankaar dikhaata he
 Political history of Karnataka Political history of Karnataka has been very complex
 1985 ke baad vahaan koi bhi dal dobaaraa satta main waapas nahin laut sakaa he
 The JDS maintains a significant footprint in the Old Mysore region
 ye devgauda parivaar kaa garh mana jaataa he
 However, in the 2013 elections, the Congress had managed to make a dent here
 vokkaliga-lingayat fite main jedies ko phaaydaechadi devgauda vokkaliga samudaay se aate hai
 The Vokkaliga community, with 15 per cent of the population in Karnataka, is primarily considered to be the vote bank of the JDS
 rajya main ab tak vokkaliga samaaj ke 6 siem ban chuke hai
 By placing bjp-congress bets on the Lingayat card, this vote bank can again go to the JDS
 vokkaliga samudaay dakshin ke jilon main failaa hua he
 The dalit-muslim vote equation 19 percent of the Dalit community in Karnataka also matters
 dalit matadaata sabase zyada hai
 Though there is a lot of division in this, JDS is eyeing this vote bank in alliance with BSP
 iske alaava congress ke saath jedies kii ladaai muslim vot bank ko lekar bhi he
 If the JDS manages to make inroads in all of these, then the Congress will suffer
 dakshini jilon main bijepi ko ummid congress ke purv netaa or rajya ke purv siem es
 m belongs to Krishna who has come to the bjp's fold this time
 kul milakar dekha jaae to is baar trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main jedies kingmekar ke role main aa sakati he
 JDS government has been formed with both BJP and Congress, so it is possible for him to join any camp
 kis kheme main jaakar kya milegaa jedies kobijepi ke saath jaakar jedies centre kii satta main bhagidaari paa sakati he or 2019 ke liye chunaav ke liye endie kaa hissaa ban sakati he
 Also, it is not impossible for the JDS to join the Congress camp
 karnataka main jedies basapa ke saath gathbandhan kar chunaav ladi he or basapa bijepi ke khilaaf desh kii siyasat main congress ke saath khadi najar aati he
 Apart from this, the JDS in Kerala is part of the left wing which has been seen standing against the BJP in recent months with the Congress in national politics

 The issue of Kashmir has been an emotional issue for the people of India and Pakistan
 imran khan aksar apni raajnneetik jameen taiyaar karne ke liye inhen bhaawanaaon ko hawa dete dikhe hai
 In his address before becoming PM, Imran described Kashmir as an important issue between the two countries, but advocated peace and compromise by coming to a table to resolve the issue of Kashmir

 imran khan ne kaha ki vah aise pakistani hai jo vyapaar ke mahatv ko samajhate hai

 This in itself was shocking and completely different from the behavior of the former rulers of Pakistan
 iske peeche imran khan kaa nijee anubhav bhi ho saktaa he
 Because Imran has had business contracts with top Indian companies in the past
 bataa den ki 80 ke dashak main jab pakistani team bharat ai thi tab imran ne godarej ke sinthul sabun ke liye apana pehla aid kiya tha

 Along with this, UIDAI also said that legal action is being taken against zdnet for publishing false and irresponsible reports
 zdnet ne daawa kiya ki haikar aadhaar card holder ke naam, 12 disit kii pahchaan sankhya, bank khate kii jaankaree or usase judi sevaaon kii nijee jaankaree aasaani se hasil kar sakate hai
 This report also said that the zdnet team tried several times to contact the Indian authorities regarding serious lapses in security of Aadhaar data and sent e-mails, but they had not received any reply in this regard yet

 haalanki aadhaar number gopneey number nahin he or sirf iske jariye koi kisi kii nijee jaankaree nahin hasil kar saktaa he
