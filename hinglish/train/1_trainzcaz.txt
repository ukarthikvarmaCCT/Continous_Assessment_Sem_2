 To go to great lengths to get freedom and to show fearless style, both these things Chandrashekhar Azad is immortal today
 aaie jaanate hai unke bare main:1
 His ideology changed with the sudden discontinuation of the non-cooperation Movement by Gandhiji and he became an active member of the Hindustan Republican Association by joining revolutionary activities
 2
 Chandrashekhar joined Gandhiji's non-cooperation Movement in 1921 at the age of just 14, and was arrested and when the judge asked him his father's name, Chandrasekhar gave his name Azad and father's name Independence and address in jail
 Told

 3
 ek baar elahabaad main police ne unhen gher liya or goliyaan daagni shuru kar di
 There was firing from both sides
 chandrashekhar aaazaad ne apane jivan main ye kasam kha rakhi tha ki wo kabhi bhi jinda police ke haath nahin aaenge
 So they shot themselves
 4
 The park in which he died after independence, that park in Allahabad was renamed Chandrashekhar Azad Park and the Dhimarpura village in Madhya Pradesh where he lived was renamed Azadpura
 5
 Azad's early life was spent in the tribal area, so in childhood, Azad shot a lot of bow and arrow with the Bhil boys

 jabaki aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye aisa nahin he

 Even the price of tea being served at home is being included in the election expenses

 Even door to door campaigns are being banned

 Pakistan's provocative action on the loc is continuing, leading to increasing tension between the two countries
 pakistani sainikon ne pichley chaar din main aathvin baar mangalvaar subah phir se sijafire kaa ulanghan kiya or jammu kashmir ke samba jile main bhartiya seemaa chaukiyon ko nishaanaa banaakar goliyaan chalaayin

 After Anil Kumble's resignation as coach, the Indian team has now got a new coach in the form of Ravi Shastri
 jis tarah se kumble ke saath coach ke rup main bartaav hua, uske baad saaf taur par kohli ko kaaphi aalochana jhelni padi thi
 After Ravi Shastri became the coach, it is now expected that the team will do well in uniting again, but we will tell you what can be the bad effect on Team India after Ravi Shastri became the coach: senior players Leaf 1 can be cut
 yuvaraj singh :ravi shastri ke coach banane ke baad team ke anbhavi khilaadiyon par gaaj gir sakati hai
 The effect of age has started showing on Yuvi at this time
 aise main in khilaadiyon kaa team main jagah bananaa mushkil ho saktaa hai
 Yuvraj Singh, who played a one-time match winner in India's team and was instrumental in winning India the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 World Cup, has been recovering from cancer ever since
 It is not the same now
 ballebaaji main bhi ab us puraane yuvaraj kii jhalak nahin dikhti he, haal main hi khatm hui champions trophy ke pehle match ko chhod diya jaae to baaki match main yuvaraj ne kuch khaas pradarshan nahin kiya he 
 If the Indian team wants to win the 2019 World Cup, then it is quite sure that Shastri will keep this in mind, due to which Yuvraj Singh's exit is considered almost certain
 2
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Looking at Dhoni's recent performance, he is also getting a lot of questions, how well it will be to take him to the 2019 World Cup and Shastri gives a lot of preference to the young batsmen, after which Dhoni has to go out of the way
 Can be shown
 isse pehle ravi shastri dhoni kii captaini ke paksh main bhi nahin dikhe the
 When Ravi Shastri said in a TV show, i just advise Dhoni that the time has come that he can enjoy his cricket rather than face pressure and hand over the captaincy of the three formats to Virat Kohli
 kyonki dhoni kii captaini main ab wo bhukh nahin dikhaai detii
 There were also reports that it was due to Shastri that Dhoni retired from Test cricket
 ravi shastri or viraat kohli ke bich kareebi badhane kii vajah se dhoni kaaphi asahaj the
 Trouble had increased to such an extent that Dhoni was not able to take decisions openly
 team kaa hoga aakraamak ravaiyacricket ko hameshaa se jental mans kaa khel mana jaataa he
 India is always seen as a quiet team
 isaki vajah maidan main khilaadiyon kaa ravaiya rahaa hai
 But the very aggressive nature of Ravi Shastri and Kohli coming together will change the attitude of the team
 team main ye ravaiya ek nakaaratmak soch laaegaa, jisase team ke pradarshan or khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan prabhavit ho saktaa he
 It will be interesting to see how Ravi Shastri can take the team forward in the coming times
 keval viraat kaa samarthanbhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli or ravi shastri ke rishte bhi jag jaahir hai
 Virat Kohli is considered to be the closest to Ravi Shastri
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ravi shastri ke kaaran hi viraat kohli ko test team kii captaini bhi mili thi
 Even when Ravi Shastri was working as the director of Team India, Ravi was always seen praising and supporting Virat Kohli
 keval viraat kohli kaa hi samarthan karnaa ravi shastri ke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 Because if the time to come is to be thought of, then no other player of Team India would want the head coach of the team to support only the captain of the team and no one else
 aise main team main baghawat kii ummiden kaaphi bad jaaengi
 Cheteshwar Pujara and Ashwin may also be on leave after Rahul Dravid retired in Test for the Indian team, if any player has taken his place, it is Cheteshwar Pujara
 lekin ravi shastri ko pujaara keeballebajipasand nahin he, kyoki pujaara behad hi dhimaa khelte he or isse test match dra hone ke asaar adhik ho jate he
 Ravi Shastri once criticized Pujara for this
 aapako bataa den ki pujaara kii dhimi ballebaaji ke kaaran hi rohit sharma ko number 3 par kuch maichon main khilaayaa gaya tha
 At the same time, Team India's off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is very successful in India, but as soon as the team goes to play outside the subcontinent, Ashwin's balls do not prove to be effective at all
 aise main ravi shastri ek baar phir wo kar sakate hai, jo 2014 ke australian daure ke edilade main khele gaye pehle match main kiya tha
 When the team management headed by him dragged Ashwin and fed him to Karn Sharma
 ravi shastri kaa coach bananaa dhoni yug ke ant ke saath-sathviraat yugaka udai mana ja rahaa he
 The manner in which the BCCI and the Advisory Committee have set the norms and rules for Kohli's wishes shows that at this time Kohli is not the captain but the big boss of the Indian cricket team

 kudankulam pariyojna ke khilaaf jari andolan par unhone kaha ki iske peeche kuch gupt makasad hai

 Now that the Yogi government, sitting on the power of the state, has taken its six-month journey, the question is arising that how much the government has moved towards making UP a model state
 yogi ke paas samay zyada nahin he kyonki mahaj 18 maheene baad unhen phir se rajya kii janata ke bich piem modi ke liye vot maangane janaa he or tab unase piem modi ke chunavi vaade ke bare main sawaal jarur poocha jayega
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has released a report on his 180-day functioning
 lekin bigadi kanoon vyavastha, badahaal swasthya seva or ladkadaati bijli vyavastha unpar sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 Demolished power system Adityanath had promised to repair the power system of the state as soon as he assumed power
 isi kadi main unhone centre sarkaar ke saath 24 ghante bijli dene kaa samjhauta kiya tha
 Under this, the district headquarters was said to provide electricity for 24 hours, tehsils for 20 hours and villages for 18 hours
 aaj 6 maheene ke baad yogi kaa ye vaada sirf vaada sabit hua he
 The Yogi government is celebrating the completion of its 6 months, but in many districts people are on the streets over electricity
 yogi ke khud ke kshetra gorakhpur main bhi ghanton bijli kii katautee jari he
 The Yogi government has destroyed the identity of VVIP district on electricity, but in most districts, the power crisis has deepened due to several reasons
 khud bijli mantri bhi maanate hai ki bijli kii haalat thik nahin he
 Minister Shrikant Sharma says that he inherited a decaying power system, so it will take time to improve
 badahaal swasthya sevauttar pradesh swasthya seva kii haalat jagajaahir he
 In 6 months, if the Yogi government was the most surrounded or the most criticized on any issue, then it was a public health issue
 yogi ke grihgile gorakhpur main BRD medical college main oxigen kii kami se saikadon bacchon kii maut hui or ye silsilaa ab bhi jari he
 At the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Farrukhabad, dozens of children died due to lack of oxygen
 iske alaava meerut main swine flu se bhi kai marijon kii maut hui
 The government has not been able to progress much in terms of health
 gorakhpur main ames kaa shilanyas hue 1 saal se adhik vakt biit chukaa he, yogi sarkaar ke 6 maheene guzar chuke hai magar ab tak ames aspataal kaa nirmaan kaary bhi shuru nahin ho sakaa hekya encounter ke boote sanbhalegi kanoon vyavastha?yogi sarkaar encounter ke jariye kanoon vyavastha durust karne ke liye apni peeth thapthapa rahi he
 According to government statistics, in 6 months, the police killed 15 miscreants in 420 encounters
 84 badmaash ghayal hue
 In six months, 1106 miscreants were arrested
 lekin soobe main halaat ye he ki har roj kahin na kahin kisi na kisi kii hatya, balaatkaar or dakaiti jaisi ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 Yogi's cabinet minister Suresh Khanna told the assembly that till May 9, there were a total of 729 murders, 803 rapes, 60 robberies, 799 robberies and 2682 kidnapping incidents in the state
 gaddha yukt raaston par daudegi vikaas kii gaadi?yogi sarkaar ne 100 dinon main rajya kii sadakon ko gadde mukt banane kaa daawa kiya tha, lekin 180 din guzar chuke hai phir bhi sadakon ke gadde bhar nahin paae hai
 After 100 days, it was argued by the Yogi government that the pit of corruption cannot be filled so soon
 samaajawaadee purvanchal express ve adhar main lataka hua he, bas iskaa naam badalakar sirf purvanchal express ve rakh diya gaya he
 The government does not have the money, so now the government wants to pursue the Purvanchal Expressway with NHAI
 karjamaafee se tarif kam, lekin badanaami zyaadavidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hi bijepi ne upi ke kisaanon ke karj maafee kaa vaada kiya tha
 This was the reason that people started talking about debt waiver as soon as the government was formed
 yogi sarkaar is disha main aage badi or pehali hi cabinet main 1 lakh tak ke karj ko maaf karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Under this, the farmers of the state also benefited, but some farmers were distributed certificates of waiving loans of small amount of only 9 paise, 18 paise, 20 rupees
 jisase sarkaar kii puri karjamaafee skim par sawaal uthne lage or wo majaak kaa paatr bani
 Anti-molestation of girls: The government formed an anti-romeo squad to stop molestation of girls
 iske tahat pulicekarmiyon ne premi jodon ko pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Which was very bad about it
 jis teji se anti romeo sqoid harakat main ai, utani hi teji se gaayab bhi ho gai
 Now, comments on women in schools, colleges and public places, molestation cases are coming back again
 khatai main nadiyon kii kayakalpagomati river front kaa kaam bich main hi ruk gaya he
 This was Akhilesh Yadav's dream project, but now CBI is facing the heat of investigation
 varanasi main varuna ke river front kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Akhilesh Yadav's plan to build a super specialty cancer and liver hospital is also in the process
 matlab saaf he ki yogi sarkaar agar aise hi chalati rahi to phir upi ko model state banane kaa piem modi kaa vaada jumala sabit ho jayega

 The duration of the special session may go ahead
 The Delhi government issued a statement saying, "A two-day special session of the assembly has been called on 26 and 27 May to discuss the notification of the central government that has taken away its power from the Delhi Assembly
 'mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kii adhyakshata main shanivaar ko hui mantrimandal kii baithak main yah nirnay liya gaya

 gopal subramanyam ne likhaa he, 'mujhe ummid he ki ye notification raashtrapati kii anumati ke bina hi jari hua he
 In such a situation, it is completely unconstitutional

 sansadeey sachiv maamle main 'aap' ke 20 vidhayakon ko hoicourt se raahat milane ke baad party netaaon ne dilli vidhansabha main press conference ke dauraan chunaav ayog ke faisle par sawaal khadey karte hue vipakshi dalon se saath aane kii apil kii he
 The AAP party has raised the demand for an impartial inquiry, accusing the BJP IT chief of tweeting the Karnataka election dates ahead of the announcement
 party netaaon ne desh ke sabhi vipakshi dalon se mulaakaat karne kii jaanakri dete hue centre kii bijepisarkarko iviem se lekar 'aap' vidhayakon ke maamle main shaamil hone kaa aarope bhi lagaaya he
 Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh alleged that at present, the Election Commission is not taking action with impartiality, whether it is the issue of evms or the case of 20 mlas in Delhi, or the election dates of Gujarat or Himachal
 Many times, the Election Commission waited till the Prime Minister's rallies and only after that the election dates were announced
 unhone kaha, 'bhartiya janatapartike iti cell ke pramukh ne karnataka chunaav kii tarikho kaa elaan chunaav ayog se pehle hi kar diya, usase ye sabit ho jaataa he ki desh kaa nirvachan ayog aaj puri nishpakshta se kaam nahin kar rahaa he, nirvachan ayog bhartiya janata party ke ishaare par kaam kar rahaa he
 If no action is taken against the culprits in this case, then the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will not be found fair
 'aam aadmi party ne hoicourt se raahat paane vaale 20 vidhayakon ke sansadeey sachiv maamle par bhi chunaav ayog ko jamkar gheraa
 Sanjay Singh said that the way the whole country is in front that former Election Commissioner AK Jyoti decided to disqualify 20 party mlas a day before his retirement, it was entirely at the behest of BJP Was and that decision was of the Bharatiya Janata Party

 ab rakesh ne atul ko phanne khan diarect karne kaa mauka diya, jisaki script par kaaphi samay se kaam chal rahaa tha
 It is a Hindi film inspired by the Belgian film Everibadi is Famous
 jisamen anil kapur, aishwarya raay bachchan or rajkumaar dikhenge
 How is the film finally made, let's review
 
 Badne Khan's Badla 'achhe Din' song, was there pressure on the makers? The story of the story is of Taxi Driver Prashant alias Fanney Khan (anil Kapoor)
 phanne ko orcestra main gane kaa bada shauk he
 But due to the needs of the house, he can never become a big singer and starts working in the mill
 uske ghar main uski bivi (divya datta) or beti lata (pihu sand) rahete hai
 Fanne wanted him to become a singer like Mohammed Rafi
 lekin aisa ho nahin paata he
 But when he has a daughter in his house, Fanne swears that he will definitely make his daughter a singer like Lata Mangeshkar
 yahi kaaran he ki wo beti kaa naam lata rakhata he
 Lata teases everyone because of her obesity
 isi bich kahani main twist tab aata he
 When Funne, Adhir (rajkumar Rao) kidnap the famous singer Baby (aishwarya Rai Bachchan)
 kya phanne apana sapana puraa kar paayegaa? use kya kya jhelana padataa he, ye sab jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi

 imoshan ke saath unki parivaar or baaki kirdaaron ke saath chemistry sateek jaati he
 Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has a decent role
 rajkumaar raav sarprise package hai, jo apni maujuudagi bakhubi darj karaate hai
 In the film, Pihu Sandar performs well as Anil's daughter
 film kaa becoground score badhiya he
 The good thing is that most of the real locations have been shot
 film kaa sangeet bhi thik thaak he
 The political backlash over the song 'achhe Din', the bjp's retaliation on Digvijay, the weak link of the film is its story, which could have been made very good
 film kii soch or van liner badhiya hai
 But the screenplay waned
 anil kapur, rajkumaar raav jaise behtareen actors kii maujuudagi ke baavjood bhi film bahut ausat dikhaai padati he
 The climax in particular is weak
 baap-beti ke rishte ko bhi kaaphi halkaa dikhaaya gaya he
 While she is the life of this film
 ek bahut acchhee film banaayi ja sakati thi, lekin wo ausat hi rah gayi
 Ek zindagi, ek sapna

 Seeing the prolongation of the strike of a section of pilots in Air India, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has called a meeting of all the recognized unions of this government aviation services company next week to sort out the various issues related to the salaries and conditions of service of the employees

 It will discuss issues related to promotion and progress during the service
 ’ mantralay kii yah pahal airline main karmchaaree-prabandhan sambandhon main kisi prakaar kii or gadabadi kii sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye he
 It is noteworthy that the process of integration of employees in the integrated company Air India formed after the merger of erstwhile Air India and Indian Airlines also needs to be supported as there is a possibility of dissatisfaction among some sections of the employees regarding salary and promotion opportunities in the process
 is
 ullekhneey he ki is baithak main nyaayamurti dharmadhikari samiti kii siforeeshon par charchaa hogi
 This report is about the process of integration of the two erstwhile government airlines after their merger

 The IPG is also in talks but it is demanding that 71 of its members who were sacked during the strike be reinstated and the recognition of the union should also be restored

 The NGT sternly stated that if this amount was not deposited by the Volkswagen company by Friday, the company's MD would be arrested
 foxwagon company se ye jurmaana isliye vasula ja rahi he, kyonki car banane vaali is company ne dijal vaahanon main carbon utsarjan kam dikhaane ke liye her-pher karne vaali divaais laga di thi
 Due to this disturbance, Volkswagen's vehicles on the roads spread pollution in the environment and do not follow the rules, which the car manufacturer needs to do to prevent pollution
 is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad NGT ne jaanch ke liye ek cameti banaai thi, jisane paryaavaran ko hue nuksaan kaa akalan kiya tha
 After the report of the committee, the NGT imposed a penalty of Rs 171 crore on the Volkswagen company
 haalanki, is jurmaane ko bharne ke bajaay foxwagon company ne engiti ke is aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti de di thi, lekin maamle main sheersh adaalat ne company ko raahat dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court gave no stay to the company to pay the fine and fixed January 21 as the date of hearing
 iske baad guuruuvaar ko engiti ne is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan company ko nirdesh diya ki vah 100 karod rupee kii rakam yaa to shuukravaar shaam 5 baje tak jamaa karaae yaa phir gambhir nattejey bhugatne ke liye taiyaar rahe
 If the company does not pay Rs 100 crore by Thursday following the ngt's orders, action could be taken from the arrest of the company's MD to the seizure of assets of the Volkswagen company in India
 foxwagon company ne pehali baar saal 2015 main mana tha ki usne saal 2008 se saal 2015 ke bich duniyabar main bechi gai ek karod 11 lakh gadiyon main 'difit divaais' lagaai thi
 The specialty of this device is that during lab testing, the Volkswagen wiring proved to meet environmental standards, while the truth was that Volkswagen cars were emitting more nitric oxide gas
 yah utsarjan europea maanakon se chaar guna adhik tha
 Volkswagen has so far had to pay a fine of billions of rupees at different places due to this manipulation
 company sirf germany main hi kareeb 8,300 karod rupee kaa jurmaana bhar chuki he
 Also, some top executives of the company have been jailed in this case
 ab bharat main bhi foxwagon company kii mushkil bad gai he

 Omar said, 'what happened in Kishtwar should be condemned

 It is a different matter that Scindia could not make the party successful at that time
 ab agle saal vahaan chunaav hona he or shivaraj singh chouhan ke 15 saal ke anti inkambency kii ummid main congress apane liye satta palat kaa ek mauka dekh rahi he
 Scindia would not like to let go of this opportunity
 khaastaur par tab jab 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav or dilli donon abhi dur kii kaudi hai! Now let's try to understand the sloganeering in AICC
 ek mitra bataate hai ki mohan prakaash ko incharge ke taur par na to kamalnath chaahate hai na sindhiya
 In such a situation, what is the harm if the worker kills the cat with some help Nobody's name will come and work will be done
 mohan prakaash madhyapradesh ke incharge hai or arun yadav pradesh congress adhyaksh
 Some activists, who reached the AICC from Madhya Pradesh, were accusing the two local organizations of arbitrarily changing seven block presidents before the elections
 unka kahana tha ki madhyapradesh main sanghathan chunaav kaa elaan ho chukaa he lekin usase pehle hi whatsap massej ke jariye saat block adhyakshon ko badal diya gaya he
 This worker reached the Congress headquarters with his complaint in this regard
 unka aarope he ki ghanton intjaar karaane ke baad bhi mohan prakaash unase nahin mili
 Then slogans started
 is bich ek doosraa ghatnakram aage bad chukaa tha
 After returning from abroad, Kamal Nath went to meet party president Sonia Gandhi
 isse is charchaa ko or bal mila ki unhen madhya pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari saunpi ja sakati he
 Actually this discussion has been going on for several weeks
 ab jaakar use amali jama pehanaane kii taiyaari he
 This meeting is also being seen as an opportunity to present a report card as Kamal Nath as Haryana Incharge
 haryana main bhupinder singh hooda khemaa puri kaman apane haath main chahta he
 Not only does he want to bid farewell to Ashok Tanwar as the state president but also remove Kiran Chaudhary as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party
 laal pagadi ke khilaaf baari pad rahi gulabi pagadi kii is ladaai ko aise sulajhaa paanaa kamalnath ke liye ek badi chunauti he ki saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi na toote
 Anyway, returning to Kamal Nath, he comes to the question of the new responsibility
 madhyapradesh ke adhyaksh arun yadav ko hataakar kamalnath ko kaman dene main sawaal yah tha ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ko is baat ke liye kaise taiyaar kiya jaae
 The post of Deputy Leader of the Lok Sabha Congress is vacant after Amarinder Singh became the Chief Minister of Punjab
 puri ummid he ki sindhiya ko upanetaa bana diya jaae
 There is also talk of making him General Secretary in Rahul's new team
 tippaniyan But the question is still that Scindia will leave his legacy of Madhya Pradesh as 'settle' in Delhi like this? That too when he was made the head of the campaign committee in 2013 elections, apart from the wishes of an old leader like Digvijay Singh
 ye alag baat he ki tab sindhiya party ko kamyaabi nahin dilaa paae
 Now elections are to be held there next year and in the hope of 15-year anti-incumbency of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the Congress is looking at an opportunity to overturn power
 sindhiya ye mauka haath se jane dena nahin chahenge
 Especially when both the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and Delhi are still far away! ab AICC main hui narebaazi ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai
 a friend says that neither Kamal Nath nor Scindia want Mohan Prakash as in charge
 aise main kuch adane se kaaryakarta billi maar den to kya buraai he! kisi kaa naam bhi nahin aayega or kaam ho jayega

 vaarta ke madhyam se assam kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan kii prakriya kii shuruyaat hogi
 "but when asked again about the disputed demand of the organization, he said," If we raise the demand for sovereignty again, the talks will not take place
 ’yah poochne par ki kya ulpha ne maang chhod di he to unhone kaha, ‘1979 main rajya kii sthiti ko dekhte hue ham assam ke liye samprabhutaa chaahate the
 The ULFA was born and we went out to escalate the conflict

 The Center's interlocutor PC Haldar called the progress "very positive" which would provide a very constructive and meaningful basis for the negotiations

 Asked if the talks would be successful without the involvement of his absconding 'commander in Chief' Paresh Barua, Chaudhary said, "why do you think the talks will not succeed

 Under the guise of fighting communal forces in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress Party gave a green signal to the alliance with the Samajwadi Party
 ise lekar betaabi donon ore hi he, kyonki donon ko ek duusare kii zarurat he
 The Congress, which has lost its base in the state, is fighting to save its nose, so for the ruling SP, this election is a credibility question
 varisht congress netaa evam party ke upi prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad ne mangalvaar ko elaan kar diya ki congress upi main sapa kii cycle main hawa bharne ko taiyaar he
 It is to be noted here that the discussion of this alliance has been in full swing for the last several days

 The alliance formula has been prepared under Priyanka's supervision

 Here, the Congress party wants to have 15 alliances with the SP so that the nose of this national party remains
 yahi vajah he ki rajya ke 403 vidhansabha siton main se vah 100 ke figure par abhi bhi adi hui he
 So at the same time, SP is talking about giving 85 to 88 seats to Congress
 sutron ke mutabik, rahul gandhi chaahate the ki congress party ko dedh sau siten mili, lekin unhone gathbandhan ke liye guna-bhaag kaa faisla priyanka ke haath chhod diya
 The green signal to the seats of the first two phases is now being examined by the final figures in both the parties

 The SP has already promised to give about 21 seats to Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 isliye donon gut ek duusare par dabaav bana rahe hai
 What will be the compromise in Gandhi's stronghold? The Congress party put the maximum pressure on the SP with seats in the traditional constituency of the Gandhi family
 congress se samjhaute ke tahat gandhi ke garh raibareli or amethi main sapa apane 7 maujuuda vidhayakon ko ticket nahin degi
 The SP wants the Congress to compensate for this in Purvanchal
 magar congress kii samasya yah he ki is ilaake main bijepi kaaphi majboot he
 At the same time, with some seats like the party's second seat Padrauna, where the Congress was ranked number 2 in the Lok Sabha elections, it does not want it to lose its good seats, which are likely to win

 Payal to commit suicide and other charges
 doctor paayal tadvi ne hostel ke kamare main khudakushi kii thi or is maamle main teen varisht doctoron ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 ayodhya par 9 november ko aayaa tha SC kaa aitihaasik faislavivaadit bhoomi par ramalala virajman ko mila malikana haksunni vaff board ko ayodhya main hi 5 acre jameen dene kaa aadeshram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par 9 november ko supreme court kaa aitihaasik faisla aa chukaa he
 a five-judge constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, while delivering the verdict, has recognized Ramlala Virajaman as the real owner of the disputed land
 iske saath hi sarkaar ko 6 maheene ke bheetar ek trust banaakar mandir nirmaan kii ruparekha tay karne ko bhi kaha he
 While the court has ordered the Sunni Waff Board to give 5 acres of land in Ayodhya itself
 supreme court ke faisle ke baadaraam mandirnirmaan ko lekar sarkaar dwaara banaae jane vaale 'ayodhya trust' ko lekar sadhu-santon ke bich vivaad shuru ho gaya
 Amidst the controversy, Aaj Tak tried to bring all the major sages of Ramnagari on one platform
 iske saath hi yah jaanane kii koshish bhi kii ki mandir nirmaan ko lekar unki kya ichha he
 During the program, all the Sadhus-saints simultaneously reiterated that Lord Ram's temple should be built as soon as possible after the Supreme Court's decision and if there is a delay in the construction of the temple, at least remove the tent where Lord Ram is staying there
 The womb house should be constructed
 baad main mandir chaahe jab tak banataa rahe
 This fact arose when former MP and member of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas Ram Vilas Vedanti said that the temple will be ready by 2024
 darasal ek sawaal ke jawaab main vedanti ne kaha tha, "narendra modi kii ore se main bataa rahaa hum, 3 maheene ke andar trust kaa nirmaan hoga or 3 maheene ke baad mandir nirmaan kii prakriya aarambh ho jaaegi or mujhe lagata he ki 5 saal ke andar isi panchavarshiya yojana main mandir banakar taiyaar ho jayega or usamen bhagwaan ram virajman ho jaaenge"
 He added, "I cannot predict whether the election of 2024 will be contested at the temple or not, but i can say that the temple will be constructed by 2024"
 iske baad ramalala mandir ke mukhya pujari acharya satyendra das ne saaf kaha ki mandir nirmaan main agar adhik vilamb ho rahaa he to pehle kam se kam garbh grih kaa nirmaan kar tent se ramalala ko mukti dilaa deni chahie
 There should not be politics on this
 agar ramalala phir 4-5 saal tak tatapattee main rahete hai to is tarah ke trust kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Ramlala has stayed in the Tatpatti for a long time
 iske baad dharmaguru karpatri ne acharya satyendra das kii baat kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki agar 2024 tak mandir nirmaan kii baat ho rahi he to jarur iske peeche kuch raajnneeti he
 i would just like to say that the saint of Ayodhya wants to see the Ram temple built as soon as possible
 thik aisi hi baat hanuman gadhi ke mahant raju das ne bhi kahi
 He said, "divinity should be removed without delay and maintain divinity there
" hamen trust se koi lenaa-dena nahin

 ye film un chuninda filmon main shaamil ho gai he jiske pehle hafte or duusare hafte ke box offis collection main zyada fark nahin he
 The release of Simba, Manikarnika and Thackeray did not make much difference to the film and the film made 71 in its first week of release
 26 karod or phir duusare hafte main 62
 77 crores
 iske alaava tisare or chauthe hafte main bhi film ne apni raftaar ko banaae rakhaa he
 Film Name: Pyar Ka Panchnama 2 Director: Luv Ranjanstar Cast: Karthik Aryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Sunny Singh Nijjar, Sonali Sehgal, Omkar Kapoor and Ishita Sharma Duration: 136 minutes Certificates: Erating: 3
 5 stardiarector lav ranjan ne saal 2011 main 'pyaar kaa panchnaama' film banaai, jise darshakon ne kaaphi pasand kiya
 After 2 years, 'akash Vani' was also brought which was rejected by the public and now Pyaar Ka Panchnama 2 has been released
 kya pehle part kii hi tarah is film main bhi purushon par ho rahe pyaar bhare atyaachaar ko darshak pasand karenge?kahaneeyah kahani he teen dostopanshul 'gogo' (karthik aryan), siddharth urf 'chaukaa' (sani singh) or tarun urf thakur (onkaar kapur) kii, jinaki jindagi main kramshah ruchika urf chiku (nushrat bharucha), supriya (sonaali sahagal) or kusum (ishita sharma) naam kii ladkiyaan hai
 Now, how the life of these three couples goes through love love and what bothers the boys' presence of girls is shown in the film
 scriptfilmaki script ko purushon ke dard se prerit hi rakhaa gaya he
 Once again, an attempt has been made to show the happenings of everyday life on the screen by taking out the pen
 ladakiyon ko kya pasand he or kis baat par unka mood kab kharaab ho jaae, isko bhi alag-alag sanvaadon ke aadhaar par bayaan kiya gaya he
 Like the previous film, this time there is a big monologue which Karthik Tiwari is seen performing
 film main kirdaaron ke naam bhi kaaphi alag hai jaise gogo, chaukaa or thakur
 The plot of the film is similar to the previous film, but this time the story is decorated with outdoor views
 tino couples ke milane se lekar unke bich ishk panpane or nok-jhonk ke alag alag flavor bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 In today's fast paced life, this story has been written keeping the couple's life in mind
 actingteenon jodiyon ne abhinay acha kiya he or diarector ne jo bhi flavor in teenon jodiyon ko diya he us daayre mempraformansubhi dikhaai padati he
 While on one side there are stories involving Karthik and Nushrat, who have both played in character, Sunny Singh's comedy-filled dialogues and acting are also laughable
 sonaali sahagal or ishita sharma or onkaar kaa abhinay saraahneey he
 The film is an adult story, due to which the three actresses have done a very smooth job to give a glamorous shot
 musicafilm kaa sangeet teenon couples ke hisaab se rakhaa gaya he haalanki kuch geet agar nahin hote to film kii raftaar or bhi tej hoti
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its length, and if the short songs or sequences were kept short, the film would have been even more crisp and cut-to-cut
 kyon dekhegar aap edlt hai or kisi relationships main yaa shaadishuda hai to yah film ek baar jarur dekh sakate hai kyonki actors kii acting dekhakar aap bilkul nahin kah sakate ki wo apni kala main maahir nahin hai
 We all know that when Indians speak English, they are not pure English
 wo hindi or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey bhashaaon kaa mishran hota he
 Learn, we are giving you an example of some words used in English influenced by Indian languages: 1
 bhartiya aksar poochhate hai- 'what is your 'good' name?' ye vaakya angreji kaa nahin he
 But it is interesting to know where the 'good name' trend started
 hindi main ''aapkaa shubh naam kya he?'' kehane kaa prachlan he
 The word 'auspicious' is said to be of respect
 '2
 Many people use 'today morning' (today morning) and 'yesterday night' (tomorrow night) instead of 'this morning' and 'last night', which is wrong
 3
 When we address more than one person, we say 'you people', which makes no sense
 lekin ham in shabdon ke itane aadi ho chuke hai ki hamen apana galati kaa pataa hi nahin chalata he
 4
 raat ko sone ke vakt zyaadaatar mahilayen kya pahenti hai? aap kahenge- 'niti'
 This word is incorrect
 darasal hamane apane suvidhanusaar 'nite-goun' ko niti kar diya he
 5
 egg-lovers kaa fevorett brakefast 'french toast' asal main french nahin he
 In France it is known as 'french Toast' but there is no such dish in India
 6
 'he is eating my mind' - These sentences speak a lot in Indian anger, but this is a literal translation of 'he's / she's eating my brains' in English
 iskaa koi matlab nahin he or ye phani lagata he
 7
 yadi aap kisi bhartiya se puuchhenge "where are you from?" to aapako ek kaaman jawaab milegaa "I belong to Delhi"
 It may show your love for your city, but there is no such sentence in English
 isi prashn kaa doosraa jawaab- "I am from Delhi only" bhi ho saktaa he
 In Hindi it is called "I am from Delhi"
 isi 'hi' kaa litrel transleshan only main kar diya jaataa he jo ki bilkul galat he
 8
 'foreign-return' kaa prayog aksar videsh se pard kar aae yaa kaam kar ke aae vyakti ke liye kiya jaataa he
 There is no such word in English
 9
 'my boss is sitting on my head for this work' is called 'my boss is sitting on my head for this assignment' while speaking in English
 yah bhi ek bahut hi phani transleshan he
 10
 angregimen apana naam bataate samay bahut se log, udhaaharan ke liye 'main rahul' kii jagah, 'myself, Rahul kehete hai, jo ki galat angreji he

 Life has returned to life in Barwala town, 32 km north of Sarsbaj Hisar city in Haryana
 haftebhar se chali aa rahi samachar channel, police or tamashbinon kii dhul udaati gadipoon kii dhamachaukadi khatm ho chuki he
 a man, who called himself an incarnation of Kabirdas, the great Nirguna saint of Bhaktikal and whose spins were telling him above the law and constitution of the country, was arrested like a mouse and sent to a dungeon in a police van
 lekin kaale kapade vaale bandookdhaari gardon kii suraksha main 12 acre ke kilanuma satalok ashram main chale is tamaashe ne haryana police kii izzat or neend, donon uda di, saath hi baba rampal ke hath ne ek maasoom bachche sahit chah logon kii jaan le lee
 Dozens of vehicles were set on fire and journalists were brutally beaten up, so different
 raahat yahi he ki ashram main fanse 15,000 log bina kisi bade shakti prayog ke surakshit nikaal liye gaye
 L' Ekin all Why? Where did this Baba, who had been in jail for one and a half years after committing a similar uproar in Satlok Ashram of Karuntha in Rohtak district, get his strength again? After being driven away from Karauntha, how did he create a bigger empire in Hisar than ever before? And finally how did he challenge the entire machinery of the state (see box: Rampal's impregnable fort secret)? Looking at it from above, it seems that Baba was doing this only in a fad, but from the scale of the social fabric and politics of Haryana, Baba's intoxication was not wrong
 darasal haryana kii raajnneeti main deron kaa dakhal pichley ek dashak main khaasaa bad gaya he
 Jat vs Non Jat, Jat vs Dalit, Sikh vs Dalit Sikh, Aryasamaji vs Kabirpanthi, besides these there are many equations which have a deep impact on the society and politics of Haryana
 is vibhajit samaaj main sadiyon se haashie par rahe dalit or anya pichhadi jatiyon ne 1940-50 ke dashak main shuru hue in deron yani nae sampradaayon kii ore dekhnaa shuru kiya
 These dera stressed the worship of a god and spoke of equality between humans
 aage chalakar in deron ne nashamukthi jaisaa mahilaon ko vishesh lubhaane vaala mudda bhi khaasi pramukhataa se uthaaya
 If you look at the profile of 15,000 devotees who came out of Rampal's ashram, most of them are from the deprived sections of the society
 bhakton kii sankhya badaae ke saath hi netaaon ko in deron main vot bank dikhne lagata he or sarkarein utana zyada hi munh pher leti hai
 (rampal in police custody) Strict court, Rampal's relationship with the Sarkar Sajjat community was also cordial with Jat leader and then Congress Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hoodaddha
 lekin jab aktubar 2006 main rampal ne aryasamaj ke sarvocch granth satyarth prakaash ke bare main anargal tippanee kii to rohtak ke zyaadaatar aryasamaji jat uske khilaaf ho gaye or khud aryasamaji parivaar ke hudddha ko rampal ko rohtak se bhagane par majaboor hona padaa
 The court dealt strictly with Rampal amidst this behavior of politics
 adaalat main pesh hone ke baad use ek saal teen maheene tak jamaanat nahin mili
 Despite this, the people of Rampal claim that a few days before the assembly elections this time, Hoodaddha promised Baba to get the case removed
 iske liye ashram ke chah log hooddha ke dilli sthit awaas par unase mili bhi the
 However, the case did not go away
 lekin bijepi kii nai sarkaar ne bhi baba kii file kholane main khaas dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 Once again, the Punjab and Haryana High Court took the contempt case very seriously
 tab itane drame ke baad baba pakad main aayaa
 The government is now filing a lawsuit against Rampal in 20 sections including sedition
 (barwaala main satalok ashram main 5,000 se zyada logon kii baithne kii kshamta vaala atyaadhunik pandal)deron kaa rasukhsarkaar kii khamoshi kii thos vajah he
 An example of this is that when the entire nation's eyes were on the Satlok Ashram of Barwala, nestled among mustard fields, then many ministers and mlas of the ruling BJP, led by Kailash Vijayvargiya and Assembly Speaker Kanwarpal Gurjar, were in charge of the party's election in Haryana
 Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim arrived at k Dera Sacha Sauda to pay his thanks to Insa
 mana jaataa he ki is sabase prabhaavshaalee dere ke haryana main 50 lakh bhakt hai
 Baba, who is facing allegations of murder, sexual exploitation and recently forcibly impotent of 150 of his servants in different courts of Haryana and Punjab, openly supported the BJP in the last assembly election
 chunaav se pehle bhi bijepi kii list jari hote hi uske 45 pratyaashee baba ke paas pahunche the
 Amid the barwala scandal, BJP leaders had to reach the Dera Sacha Sauda in bulk, thanking them for the same favor
 dere ke pravaktaa pawan insa safai dete hai, “ek baba ke vivaad main aane se sab ko ek taraazoo main taulnaa galat he
 Guruji is involved in 104 major social works, from building houses for the poor to building prostitutes
 ye saare aarope niraadhaar hai
 We are answering these in court
 ” insa rajnatik prabhaav par ghumaakar tippanee karte hai, “raajnneeti se hamaara sidhaa matlab nahin he, lekin desh main 5 karod deraa premi hai
 When the leader comes, Guruji blesses
 ”(baba ke singhaasana par baithkar photo khinchvaate haryana police ke adhikari)udhar, sirsa ke deraa bhumanshah sangarasaadha kaa ati pichde kamboj samudaay main khaasaa asar he
 The Dera is not very active in politics, but its opposition to Om Prakash Chautala's Indian National Lok Dal is well known
 donon pakshon main lambey samay se jameen vivaad chal rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Dera always supports the party that defeated the INLD
 pichley chunaav tak iskaa phayda congress ko hota tha, lekin nai hawa main aashirwad bijepi kii jhuli main gira
 It is a different matter that despite the support of both these dera and the saint ram-rahim going to vote for the first time, the BJP lost five Vidhan Sabha seats in Sirsa
 is dere ke samaantar hi sirsa main deraa sachcha sauda jagamaliwali he
 Devotees and leaders also visit here
 ye dere agar daliton ke aasare ke liye hai, to namdhari sampradaay se sikh dharm ke log jude hai
 Dera's raga has been with the Congress since the beginning and it continued in this election as well
 haalanki deraa khuli rajnatik bayaanbaji kabhi nahin karata
 Apart from this, Radhaswami Satsang Vyas and Satnami deras are also widely affected in Haryana
 ek anumaan ke mutabik haryana main 2,000 se zyada chote-bade dere hai or takreeban har seat par koi na koi deraa game changer mana jaataa he
 There are 30 seats on which only the political appeal of Dera Sacha Sauda is considered to have a significant effect
 in deron ke alaava kurukshetra jile ke pahova main baba maan singh kaa deraa ne chunaav main ieneldi kaa samarthan kiya
 Sant Rampal Ashram of Karoda, Ashram of Swami Gyanananda of Ambala, Dera of Mandiwala Baba and then the art of living by ISKCON and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar also did not lag behind in the electoral role
 (gurmeet ram rahim insa)barood ke dher paraise main yah sawaal apni jagah kaayam rahegaa ki kya manoharlal khatter sarkaar ko aage barwaala jaise maamalon se do-chaar nahin hona padegaa
 a similar uproar in the Rohtak ashram of Sant Rampal in 2006 and the wearing of costumes like Guru Govind Singh in 2008 between Sant Ram Rahim's devotees and Sikhs in the bloody clashes on the streets of Haryana suggest that the dera many times parallel themselves He starts understanding power
 ram-rahim par gambhir maamalon ke ab bhi paanch se adhik mukademe chal rahe hai, baaki dere bhi kuch nahin to sampatti ke vivaad se to jujh hi rahe hai
 Most of the ashrams and dera chiefs of Haryana prefer to walk with privately armed guards
 in samvedansheel halaat main sarkaar agar vot ke liye baabaaon ko bavaal ke raste par aage badaae detii he to der-saver aanch ek baar phir uski choukhat par hogi kyonki adaalatein kisi se muravvat baratane vaali nahin hai

 jab-jab sanathan dharm par sankat gaharaata he or sari ummiden khatm ho jaati hai
 
 tab-tab wo aate hai
 
 dharm raksha kii aakhri jang ladane
 They come whenever the country is in danger
 yaa phir hamalaavaron ne sar uthaaya
 Wrapped with ashes
 bina libaas vaale commando
 On whose forehead there is tilak, trident in hands and anger in eyes
 har har mahadev kehete hue jo dharm or desh par mar mitane ko taiyaar hai
 
 
 He is the commando of Kumbh
 wo karm se hathi or dharm ke rakshak hai
 He is a saint with secrets and mind in appearance
 wo samskruti kii aan or sabhyataa ke paharedaar hai
 His passion in blood and country in heart
 wo koi or nahin sanathan dharm ke commando hai
 But where do they come from? wo chale kahaan jate hai
 What is their world like? wo kis duniya main kho jate hai
 Nobody knows this
 sabko bas ye pataa he ki jab kumbh yaa ardhakumbh aata he to lakhon kii taadaad main naga sadhu ek saath duniya ko nazar aate hai
 But when kumbh-kumbha becomes there, all of them suddenly disappear as if they never existed

 kehete hai bhartiya sanathan dharm ke maujuuda swaroop kii shuruyaat aadiguru shankaracharya ne kii thi
 He was born in the eighth century and the condition of India was not so good in those days

 At first, these Akharas were associated with young people who wanted to do something for the protection of religion, who through exercise and exercise first strengthened themselves and took on enemies
 lekin phir ye akhaade vairaygy kii sikh dene vaale ashramon main tabdeel ho gaye
 People joining the Akharas for the service of the nation and religion started cutting off from the world

 So that the next-previous account of every relationship in the world ends
 iske baad inhen naga diksha di jaati he, jahaan do tarah ke naga sadhu taiyaar hote hai
 a Digambara Naga monk
 duusare shri digambar naga sadhu
 The Digambara Naga monk does not wear any cloth except wearing a nappy
 jabaki shri digambar kii diksha lene vaale sadhu puri tarah nirvastr rahete hai
 The most difficult is to become a Shri Digambara Naga Sadhu because then all his senses are destroyed in order to stand on restraint and celibacy
 nirvastr rahane vaale sadhu puure sharir par raakh ko mel kar rakhte hai
 There are two reasons for this
 ek to raakh nashvarata kii pratik he duusare raakh ek tarah ke aavaran kaa kaam karti he taaki bhakton ko paas aane main kisi tarah kaa sankoch na rahe
 
 naga sadhu jis raakh ko lapetate hai wo kai baar chitaaon se lee gai murdon kii raakh hoti he to kai baar jis dhuni ke saamne wo baithe rahete hai usee kii raakh ko mel liya jaataa he

 If there is a question of place names and the sign language of the stations on the travel map of the metro, then Delhi Metro is still expected to do a lot in this matter
 darasal, inamen se kaaphi naamon ko yaa to galat tareeke se likhaa gaya he yaa alag-alag jagahon par inhen alag-alag tareeke se uccharit kiya gaya he
 For example, 'chelmsford Club', located next to the Central Secretariat Metro Station, is spelled 'chams Ford Club' at Gate No

 At the Mandi House metro station, the sign of the historic building of 'lady Irwin College' of the year 1930 has the word 'V' written in English instead of 'w' in the word Irwin
 imaarat kaa namakaran bharat ke purv vysarai lord irvin kii patni ladi dorothi irvin ke naam par kiya gaya he
 The same mistake of English has been repeated in writing the sign of 'bhagwan Das Road' on the wall of this station
 ‘bhagwaan das road’ ke ‘bhagwaan’ main angreji ke ‘w’ kii jagah angreji ke ‘V’ akshar ko likhaa gaya he, lekin yah galtiyaan keval deevaaron tak hi simit nahin hai balki yah metro train kii ‘elidi yatra maanchitr’ par bhi dikhti he
 These are written in some other way on the signs outside the station, while on the 'LED travel map' inside the train they are written in another way
 udhaaharan ke liye ‘jangpura’ stesan kaa naam patari ke paas or diwaar sanket chihnon main ‘jangpura’ likhaa gaya he, jabaki train coach ke andar inhen do shabdon ke yugma ‘jang pura’ ke rup main likhaa gaya he
 The same mistake is repeated with the name of 'moolchand'

 Pancharishta has an Ayurvedic formula that strengthens digestive power and due to this, relieves to a great extent from frequent acidity, gas and other stomach problems
 pachan sambandhi samasyaayein sabhi aayu varg main sabase aam taur par pai jane vaali swasthya samasya he
 In today's era, when lifestyle related diseases are increasing all over the world, if one finds it in his family, friends or his colleagues, then he will find comfort from a person suffering from digestive problems like acidity, gas, indigestion etc
 kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki aaj ke daur main acidity, gas, badahajmi ityadi jaisi pachan sambandhi samasyaayein itane aam taur par kyon maujuud hai? iskaa sidhaa sa jawaab haih laaparvaah jivan style
 Run-of-the-mill life, eating oat-patang, and unhealthy and unhealthy eating habits promote digestive problems
 jab baar-baar acidity, gas or badahajmi kii shikaayat rahane lage to samajhie ki chetavanee kii ghanti baj rahi he
 Due to irregular lifestyles and advancing age, digestive power weakens, its balance starts to deteriorate, leading to stomach upset
 ayurveda ke anusaar, khaanaa sahi dhang se pachne ke liye pachan agni kaa santulit rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 Agni is considered the basic element in Ayurveda, this digestive fire can be compared with the fiery fire
 agar agni kam ho jaae, to khaanaa pachne main samay lagata he, or agar agni zyada ho jaae to khaanaa samay se jaldi pach jaataa he
 If we keep a big wood in low heat then it extinguishes
 ayurveda hamen isi tarah se pachan agni ko santulit rakhane ko kahata he, jisase hamaara khaanaa nipunata se or bina kisi samasya ke pach jaae
 Due to fire imbalance, stomach aches like acidity, gas, indigestion can occur
 ayurveda ke anusaar, ''swasth pachan hi acchhee sehat kii shuruyaat he
 "in today's era of instant rest, people are increasingly looking for medicines that give instant but temporary relief, which in a way is a reflection of our careless lifestyle
 jab logon ko sab kuch ''abhi" or ''isi vakt" chahie, to jaahir si baat he, koi sahi samaadhaan kaa upyog kyon karegaa? yah lakshan sambandhi davaaiyaan kuch samay ke liye upar-upar se madad kar detii hai, lekin asli samasya uskaa jad se ilaaj nahin kar paatin
 In such a situation it becomes very important to understand that as digestion is a process, the recovery is also a process, and oftentimes, permanent relief from acidity, gas and indigestion is achieved by increasing digestive power
 pancharishth anya dawaaiyon se alag kaise he or pet kii takalifon kaa bejod samaadhaan kyon he? pancharishth 3,000 varshon ke ayurvedic gyaan par aadhaarit he
 Every drop of it is enriched with 35 distinct Ayurvedic elements like Aloe Vera, Amla, Draksha and Triphala, which affect your digestive power, affecting your seven digestive centers (mouth, stomach, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, small intestine and large intestine)
 Returns, increases appetite, and strengthens stomach
 pancharishth ke phydeyah pet ko jad se majboot kareiske har boond main 35 vishisht ayurvedic tatwon se samrudh haiyah saaton pachan centre par asar karata haiyah pachan tantra ko svachh karata haiyah pachan shakti or bhukh badhaata haiyah pachan-sambandhi samasyaon ko ghataae, acidity, gas, badahajmi ityadi jaisi pet kii takalifon se sthaayee raahat dilaataa he After Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, now kissing photos of Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor's husband Anand Ahuja are on the internet

 In fact, India Today open-source Investigation had revealed in its report with the facts how Pakistan continued to cover the deaths of its own jawans on the Line of Control
 india today kii report ke baad pakistani sena ke pravaktaa baikfoot par hai
 What is being said by the spokesperson in words, is in a way confirming the facts of the India Today report
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa kaa kahana he ki unke liye javaanon kaa hataahat hona aankadon kaa maamla nahin he
 At a press conference in Rawalpindi on Wednesday, Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said, "this is not a matter of data
" agar 20-25 hajaar logon ne pakistan ke liye qurbaani di he to ye sirf aankadon se hi nahin judaa he, ye maanavtaa ke bare main he
 They live for us according to the principle of Islam
 ' pakistani sainikon kii maut kii sankhya ko chupaane se jude sawaal par sidhaa jawaab dene kii bajaay ISPR ke diarector general gafoor ne jajbaati root kaa sahaara lekar pardaa daalane kii koshish kii
 Major General Ghafoor said, "two people (pakistani soldiers) sacrificed their lives for us
" wo apane parivaar yahaan peeche chhod gaye
 They have parents, children here
 main har pakistani se apil karata hum ki ve apane apane kshetron main in shaheedon ke pariwaron tak pahunche

 ' gafoor ne kaha, 'pakistani sena har saal 6 sitambar ko 'shahid din' manaati he or un shaheedon kii kurabaani vyarth jaaegi agar pakistani naagarik unke gharon tak nahin jate hai
 Although none of the reporters present at the press conference had questioned the India Today report, Gafoor himself made a statement at the end of the question-and-answer session
 isse pehle gafoor ne india today broadcast ke link ko share karte hue kaha tha ki ye bhartiya media kaa 'ISPR' ke liye junun he
 India Today's open-source Investigation in its report matched the Pakistani military's date-wise (historical) data with the information provided to the media every day, and found a vast difference between them
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki niyantran rekha par pakistani javaanon kii maut historical data main to ullekh kiya gaya lekin ise rojaanaa die jane vaale bayanon main chupaaya gaya
 The second part of the India Today report showed through crowd-sourced data that several jawans died on the Line of Control from July to August on behalf of the Pakistani Army
 lekin ISPR ne saarvajanik taur par ise kabool nahin kiya
 Sushant Sarin, Senior Fellow of the Observer Research Foundation, said on the India Today revelation, 'the reason behind why he does not publicly acknowledge the deaths of his jawans
 agar wo aisa karne lagen to ye pakistani sena ke liye badi sharmindagi kaa sabab hoga
 The Pakistani army wants to show itself to be accused of invincibility, when in reality it has to face a lot of trouble
 ' sareen ke mutabik pakistani sena ne kargil yuddh ke dauraan bhi yahi kiya tha
 Sarin said, "they control the media so that nothing can be leaked

 Taking a stern stand on Kumar's non-appearance in the court on Wednesday after the Delhi High Court refused to grant him relief, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Lokesh Kumar Sharma said that Kumar had the responsibility to appear before him
 asimem ne kaha, ‘aaropee ko buudhvaar ko adaalat main upasthit hone ko kaha gaya tha lekin usne upari adaalat main chunauti dene kaa rasta chunaa or sahi kiya lekin vah koi raahat nahin paa sakaa
 It was his duty to honor the order of the court
 ’adaalat main maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan sibiai ke vishesh abhiyojak or varisht adhivaktaa aar es cheema ne kumaar ke vakil ke us aavedan kaa virodh kiya jisamen unhone apane muvakkil ko adaalat main vyaktigat peshi se chhot dene kii maang kii thi
 He said that granting such an application would be a relief to the accused which has not been approved by the High Court at present

 The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, which came to power for the third time after a landslide victory in the Assembly, was surrounded by the opposition in the very first session of the Assembly
 vipaksh ke netaa satyadev kataare ne sarkaar par doshiyon ko bachaane kaa aarope lagaate hue hunkaar bhari ki ghotaale kaa puri tarah pardaafash karke hi ve dam lenge
 The people of his own party are not supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government which is getting involved in this scam of the Professional Examination Board (vyapam)
 pichley dinon bijepi kii varisht netaa or pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti ne is ghotaale ko bihar ke chaara ghotaale se bhi bada ghotaalaa qaraar diya
 Recently, the Special Task Force (STF) probing the scam has presented a 750-page challan to the court, referring to Vyapam officials and other accused who were involved in the scam
 pradesh sarkaar kii sanstha vyapam sarkari collejon ke liye pravesh ke alaava kuch sarkari vibhaagon main bhartee ke liye bhi parikshaon kaa aayojan karti he
 Vyapam officials were always accused of arbitrary entry by taking money
 lekin is farjivade kaa khulaasa pichley saal july main achaanak hi hua
 In fact, on July 7, many such Munnabhai were caught in Madhya Pradesh pre-medical Test (PMT) examination held in Indore, who were taking the exam instead of other students
 in chaatro se poochtacha main ghotaale ke mastermind dow
 Jagdish Sagar's name was revealed
 sagar kii giraftaar ke baad jab police ne usase poochtacha kii tab is bade ghotaale kaa pataa chalaa or jaankaree mili ki keval sarkari collejon main pravesh main hi nahin balki sarkari vibhaagon kii bhartee main bhi lambey samay se farjivada chalaa aa rahaa he
 Since then, there have been frequent revelations and the names of Vyapam officials as well as politicians have been added to the scam
 is maamle main estf ne vyapam ke purv pariksha niyantrak pankaj trivedi or prisimple system analist nitin mahindra sahit 130 logon ke khilaaf beete 7 or 9 disambar ko do exiar darj kii thim
 An FIR was also lodged against former Higher Education Minister Laxmikant Sharma based on the statements of Trivedi and Mahindra
 in donon ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki lakshmikant sharma ne unhen kuch chaatro ke role number die the
 Only those students had passed these people in the examination
 iske baad haal hi main sharma se bhi poochtacha kii gai
 During interrogation, the former minister denied these allegations
 lekin vipaksh ne sarkaar par unhen bachaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He had said that why Sharma was released only by interrogation instead of being arrested? The Vyapam scam took a mysterious turn when a man came forward claiming a lot of evidence related to the scam
 rajdhani bhopal se lagbhag 45 kilometre dur barkheda gaanv main rahane vaale tajwar khan beeti 15 janvari ko us samay surkhiyon main aae jab netaa pratipaksh kataare ne vidhansabha main ashanka jataai ki khan kii hatya kii ja sakati he
 As a reason, he said that Khan has a lot of concrete evidence of the Vyapam scam
 kataare khan ke ghar bhi gaye the or unki patni se mulaakaat bhi kii
 In 2012, it was Khan who lodged a complaint with the Governor and the Lokayukta about the ongoing scam in Vyapam
 shikaayat main unhone kaha tha ki vyapam ne sahaayak shikshak varg 2 or varg 3 main bhartee ke liye jo pariksha yojit karwaai thi usamen bade paimaane par farjivada hua he
 Khan had also provided a list of recruiters in a fake way

 "he also said to complain to the Lokayukta," i have lodged a complaint in this regard to the Lokayukta with evidence
 ''khan pichley dinon barkheda sthit apane ghar se achaanak gaayab ho gaye the
 Meanwhile, the Bhopal police investigating the Vyapam scam reached his house

 Khan says, "I did not run anywhere but went to Datia for some of my personal work
" '' vahiin police ne tajwar kii patni ke saath badasluki ke aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 On returning to Khan's house, Bhopal police reached his house in Barkheda and took his statement
 khan apni patni reshma or bete ke saath ek chote se ghar main rahete hai
 Now the police has also provided them security
 ve apane aap ko peshey se patrkaar or bhrashtachar kii aawaaj naam kii patrika kaa sampadak bataate hai
 Khan and his wife claim that they have been receiving threats ever since they filed complaints of rigging in Vyapam's examinations
 khan ne yahaan tak kaha he ki unki jaan ko khatra he or aise main ve suicide karne ko majaboor ho sakate hai
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has come on the defensive from all-round attacks on his government in the Vyapam scam
 congress kii ore se mudda uthaae jane ke baad unhone vidhansabha main yah sweekaar kiya he ki 2007 se lekar ab tak sarkari vibhaagon main hui 1,47,000 bhartiyon main se 1,000 niyuktiyaan farji pai gai hai
 At present, no action has been taken against these people
 chouhan ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar kisi bhi doshi ko nahin bakshegi
 However, government colleges have started taking steps at their own level against students getting admission in fake way
 pradesh ke teen medical collejon ne farji tareeke se pravesh paane vaale 153 chaatro ko pichley hafte nilambit kar diya
 These students took admission between 2006 and 2012
 inke khilaaf exiar bhi darj ho chuki he
 It is another matter that many of these students have completed their studies
 suspend kiye gaye kai chaatr adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhata chuke hai, aise main philhal inke khilaaf bhi or koi karrwai nahin ho rahi he
 Uma Bharti and Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh have demanded CBI probe into the Vyapam scam
 lekin chouhan iske liye taiyaar nahin hai
 He turned down the demand for a CBI inquiry, saying that the STF was doing its work very sincerely
 lekin vipaksh aarope laga rahaa he ki bijepi sarkaar apane doshi netaaon ko bachaane kii koshish main he
 However, if the Congress has a chance to surround the government, the government is in a sway on this issue

 And the rebellion of Fernandes is proving to be a real headache for Nitish and Sharad
 jaahir he furnandis kii ladaai pratikatmakataa se kahin aage kii baat he
 And their presence breaks the caste equations as well, which is such a special thing that keeps them far ahead in the electoral race
 shaareerik rup se puri tarah swasth na hone, joki unke kuch samarthakon ko faisle ke din unase kuch dur rakh sakati he, ke baavjood furnandis ko ab bhi nazarandaaj kiya janaa mushkil he kyonki unke virdohi nishad vishwaas jagaane main safal nahin rahe hai
 Nishad has changed parties in the past, just as college students finish one party on Saturday night and move on to another
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki apni party ke ummidavaar ke liye prachaar karne ke liye nitish kumaar ko teen baar mujffarpur aana padaa he
 Ironically, there was a time when Fernandes projected Nitish Kumar to break Lalu Prasad Yadav's supremacy
 ve samta party ke sansthaapakon main se ek hai jise unhone or nitish ne lalu ke saath sambandh bigadane ke baad sthapit kiya tha
 Later, Nitish removed Fernandes from the post of party president, in connivance with Sharad
 beshak furnandis chunavi raajnneeti kii uthapatak se taratamya nahin bitha sakate
 His opponents are arguing that this will only give symbolic representation to Muzaffarpur in Parliament
 lekin kya furnandis ko tikat na dene kaa yadav or nitish kaa faisla sahi tha? yahaan do baaten hai, jisamen se ek yah he ki yadav ne furnandis ko ek patr bheja tha jisamen unhen rajyasabha kii sadsyta kaa prastaav kiya gaya tha, yani jad (you) ke adhyaksh vaastaviktaa main shaayad furnandis kaa patta hi saaf kar rahe the
 Perhaps instead of writing letters to Yadav and Nitish, they should have met Fernandes and said that they are not in a position to contest elections
 is bich mujffarpur main furnandis puri tarah se chintaaon se pare najar aate hai
 They have folded hands, looking towards the people and as their convoy moves forward their face looks full of desire
 jaise hi ek garm hawa ko jhonka teji se aata he, halki-si muskaan unke chehre par daud jaati he
 They make fists and mumble something with trembling lips
 
 The speed of the jello increases and gets lost somewhere in the horizon
