 ' Nearly eight crore rupees were looted at Delhi's Lajpat Nagar flyover by showing a pistol to a businessman on Tuesday morning
 lut kii ye ghatana kareeb 11 baje lajpat nagar metro stesan ke paas kii he
 On Moolchand fly over, this businessman was going in a Honda City car and he was accompanied by four other people in the car
 tabhi ek wagon aar ne honda city car ko over tech kiya or sadak par hi use roak liya
 There were about three people in the Wagon R
 sabhi ke haathon main pistaul thi
 Among those seated in Honda City was a property dealer
 uske aath karod rupee ek brifces main rakhe the, abhi ye log kuch samaj paaen tabhi peeche se ek or car main badmaash aae or pistaul se daraa kar honda city ko lekar bhaag gaye
 The crooks also took away the money kept in it along with the car

 The robbers came in a total of two cars and left one of their wagon r cars on the spot
 supreme court ke aadesh par bengalooru main gathit vishesh trial court ke faisle ko kaarij karne kii jo vajah justise kumaraswami ne bataai he uname se pramukh hai :tippaniyan - The trial court did not properly assess Jayalalithaa's assets
 - trial court ne ye to maan liya ki jayalalita ne 3 karod rupee apane dattak putr kii shaadi par karch kiye lekin ye sabit karne ke liye paryaapt sabooton kaa abhaav he
 - The loan taken from the bank was not considered as a part of the income, even the property was not assessed properly
 - itnaa hi nahin, gavaahon ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag gavaahi di, aise main hai court unki gavaahi par bharosa nahin kar saktaa
 In such a situation, i feel that the trial court's decision is not statutory
 justise kumaraswami ne 919 pannon main apane faisle kii vyakhya kii he
 In this decision, he has ordered the lower court to immediately return the four people who had been confessed as accused in this case
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki taqariban 67 karod rupee ke aay se adhik sampatti kaa ye maamla yaheen khatm ho gaya? is maamle kii shuruyaat subrahmanyam swami kii yachika se hui thi or diemke kii pahal par trial supreme court ke aadesh ke baad bengalooru main shuru hua tha
 In such a situation, both of them have the option to knock the doors of the Supreme Court against this decision, as well as Karnataka can also choose the decision in the Supreme Court as a prosecution
 - trial court ne jayalalita kii sampatti kaa aankalan sahi dhang se nahin kiya
 - The trial court admitted that Jayalalithaa spent Rs 3 crore on the marriage of her adopted son, but there is lack of sufficient evidence to prove this
 - bank se liye gaye lone ko aamadani kaa hissaa nahin mana gaya isse bhi sampatti kaa akalan sahi dhang se nahin ho paaya
 - Not only this, witnesses testified differently at different times, so the High Court cannot rely on their testimony
 aise main mujhe lagata he kii trial court kaa faisla kaanoon sangat nahin he
 Justice Kumaraswamy has explained his decision in 919 pages
 is faisle main unhone nichali adaalat ko aadesh diya he ki is maamle main jin chaar logon ko mujrim qaraar dekar unki sampatti japt kii gayi thi use foran waapas kiya jaye
 Now, the question arises that this matter of disproportionate assets worth about 67 crores has ended here? The case started with a petition by Subrahmanyam Swamy and the trial started in Bengaluru following a Supreme Court order on the dmk's initiative
 aise main is faisle ke khilaaf supreme court ke darvaaze khatkhatane kaa vikalp in donon ke paas to he hi saath hi saath abhiyojan paksh ke taur par karnataka bhi faisle ko supreme court main chunoti de saktaa he
 In such a situation, both of them have the option to knock the doors of the Supreme Court against this decision, as well as Karnataka can also choose the decision in the Supreme Court as a prosecution

 faisal hossain or aihasaan khurshid par uri hamale main shaamil aatankiyon ko guide karne kaa aarope tha
 But no evidence has been found in the investigation
 donon ko 21 sitambar ko elosi ke paas pakadaa gaya tha or ab unki vaapasi kii prakriya shuru kar di gai he
 If the court accepts the closure report, both will be able to return home

 Apart from the statement made against both of them to the Indian Army, no other strong evidence could be found

 The blue sky, the coast surrounded by golden palm trees and the gorgeous views of the sea make it a great holiday destination for both native and foreign tourists, hippies and wealthy tourists alike
 yahi vajah he ki goa aane vaale sailaaniyon kii taadaad har saal badhati ja rahi he
 In 2018, Goa invited 70,81,559 tourists, the highest among the states
 us saal 9,33,481 videsh sailaani goa aae
 Apart from tourism, the mining and pharma sectors have been the mainstay of Goa's economy
 rajya kaa sakal gharelu utpaada 2017-18 main maujuuda keemton par takreeban 9
 95 billion dollars (about 70,000 crore rupees)
 ) rahaa, jo maharashtra (300 arab dollar se zyada) or karnataka ( 200 arab dollar se upar) ke mukaable khaasaa kam tha
 Yet Goa is the first because its per capita GDP is the highest in the country — two and a half times the national figure

 The terrain off the coast is rich in minerals, making mining the second largest industry in the state
 2017-18 main desh ke 32 fisad louh ayask kaa utpaadan goa main hua tha
 Some important mining companies of the country are located in the state, such as Sesa Sterlite Limited, v

 Salgaonkar and Badgers and Fomento Resources
 goa ke takreeban 1,50,000 log apni roji-roti ke liye khanan udyog par nirbhar rahane lage hai
 Not only this, Goa has become a major center for export of raw materials with vast deposits of iron and manganese ore, bauxite, industrial clay and silica sand
 desh kaa 55 fisad louh ayask kaa niryaat goa se hota he
 Iron ore exports from the state between September 2015 and November 2017 1

 In the disruption of iron ore exports to China, which often exceeded the state's capacity, Goa's mineral resources were heavily exploited, causing irreparable damage to the environment here
 15 march, 2018 ko goa main louh ayask nikaalane sahit tamaam khanan gatividhiyaan thap pad gayi
 This was the second time in nearly two years
 yah supreme court ke 7 farvari, 2018 ke us aadesh ke baad hua, jisamen louh ayask kii 88 khadaanon kii lij radd kar di gai thim
 The government renewed the leases of these mines in 2014-15, immediately before the Mines and Minerals (regulation and Development) Act, which empowered the auction of leases

 The pharmaceutical industry, along with tourism and mining, has traditionally been the third largest factor in the state's growth — manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and biological products accounted for 51 per cent of Goa's exports in 2017-18
 india today ko die gaye ek exclujiv intervyuu main goa ke mukhyamantri pramod saavant ne sarkaar kii praathamiktaayen ginate hue kaha: ''sabase zyada dhyaan yuvaaon ke liye nijee or sarkari donon kshetron main rojgaar ke avasar srujit karne par he
 In any new venture eighty percent of the jobs will have to be given to the local residents of Goa
 '' unhone yah bhi bataaya ki duusare number par sabase zyada dhyaan ''yuvaaon ke liye swarozgaar ko badhaava dene par he or yah udyog (svachh udyog), sevaaon, krishi, deyari farming tathaa machhlipaalan main nivesh ke liye start-ap companiyon ko protsaahanon ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 What are these big incentives being given to start-up companies? Sawant says, "start-ups starting at Rs 25 lakh are set to get Rs 10 lakh back as returns with the help of state incentives
 iske alaava, sarkaar start-ap main bhartee kiye gaye karmchaariyon kii 50 fisad tankhwaah dene main madad degi
 "" Another top priority is infrastructure
 saavant kehete hai, ''jor sadak margon, pulon or antarrashtriya hawaii addon ke nirmaan par he
 "they also say," The next priority is on three stages of tourism - first sun, sand and sea; Second, tourism in the mainland and finally medical tourism
 phir ham goa ko svachh udyogon ke audyogic centre ke taur par badhaava dena chaahate hai
 Because these industries are especially oriented towards giving jobs to the local residents of Goa
 ''khanan ke bare main kya? saavant kahin zyada satark hai
 He says, "keeping in mind the pre-conditions of the Supreme Court, we are planning an e-auction of mines
 ''sarkaar ke mishan kii ruparekha bataate hue mukhyamantri kehete hai, ''hamaara vijan goa ko khaskar chote rajyon main bharat ke sarvshereshth, sabase zyada viksit rajya ke taur par prachaarit karne kaa he

 The Eleventh Finance Commission ranked Goa as the best-placed state for its infrastructure while the National Population Commission ranked Goa at the top in the best quality of life based on 12 key indicators

 Poverty has been a result of the dynamic drivers of Alvidagroth, high standards of HDI and high per capita income, with the poverty rate in Goa being one of the lowest in the country
 prati maah yaa prati din prati vyakti khapat kharch ke aadhaar par garibi kii gananaa karne vaali tendulkar samiti ke tareeke ke mutabik (dekhen-shandaar pradarshan), 2011-12 kii janaganana ke dauraan garibi kii rekha se neeche rahane vaali aabaadi kaa anupaat goa main 5

 1 fisad), punjab (8
 3 percent), and undivided Andhra Pradesh (9
 2 fisad) sareekhe duusare rajyon ke mukaable bhi kam tha
 The miracle is that Goa crossed the long distance from being the ninth lowest poverty rate state in 2004-05 to become the state with the lowest overall poverty rate in 2011-12
 2004-05 main goa main garibi kii dar 25 fisad thi, jo 2011-12 main 5 fisad par aa gai
 That is, there has been a big fall of about 20 percent in seven years
 isi avadhi main desh main garibi kii dar main ausat giravat takreeban 15 fisad ankon par bani rahi he
 The decline in poverty rates has been more rapid in urban areas than in rural areas of Goa

 Medium and small scale industries include manufacturing units that produce pesticides, fertilizers, tires, tubes, footwear, chemicals, medicines, wheat products, steel rolling, fruit and fish cans, cashew nuts, clothing and beverage products
 in sabhi main hajaaron log kaam par lage hai
 Goa is also known for its inexpensive beer, wine and other liquor and this is due to the very low excise duty on alcohol here
 paryaton, aatithy-satkar or manoranjan kshetra bhi, jisamen bhavy mandovi nadi par falte-phoolate casino bhi shaamil hai, rojgaar paidaa karata he
 The Sawant government has started to emphasize on these medium-scale sectors, especially along with agriculture including green organic farming

 This increase at the national level is just 3

 Panaji, the state capital, has the highest urban density where 1,14,759 people live
 iske baad madagaanv (1,06,484) or mormugaanv (1,01,326) hai
 However, a large part of the urban area is located on the coastal belt, due to which there are not many industries in the main rural areas

 In terms of literacy, Goa ranks third in the states and second in developed states

 According to the 2011 census, it 88
 7 fisad ho gai thi, jo 73 fisad ke rashtriya ausat se kahin zyada thi (dekhen sakshartaa main sheersh par)
 Kerala is the only developed state whose literacy rate (94 percent) is higher than Goa
 maharashtra (82
 3 percent) and Tamil Nadu (80
 1 fisad) do anya viksit rajya hai jinaki sakshartaa dar 80 fisad se zyada he
 Yet they are still behind Goa

 saal 2003 main shuru hua rajyon kii dasha-disha (esoes) survey rajyon ke pradarshan kaa vishleshan karne ke liye mahatvapurn maanak ke taur par ubharkar aayaa he
 The survey strongly believes that the future of the country lies in the states and union territories
 goa kaa rajya kii dasha-disha survey ek kadam or aage jaataa he: yah vikaas ke ek dashak ke dauraan vibhinn shreniyon main goa ke jilon or talukaaon ke pradarshan kaa vishleshan karata he
 Each category is typically a mixed index of criteria that can be measured even after a time interval, provided the data is present
 goa ke maamle main adarsh to yahi he ki uttar banaam dakshin main sthit do jilon, jinamein harek main chah taluka hai, kii tulana kii jaae
 Taluka level data is half-incomplete and only a few standards data exist
 aage kaa rastrangreji kathan 'small ij vanderphul' goa kii anekanek takaton ko bakhubi jaahir karti he
 Goa ranked first on three indicators — economy, governance and tourism — among India's smaller states expected in India's Today's SOS Best Performance Ranking of 2018; Ranked second in infrastructure and environment and third in education and health

 However, the future brings with it many challenges
 goa main ek to menuphaccharing kii vruddhi kii gunjaaish simit hi he
 The industry usually requires vast tracts — in that sense there is little scope in Goa
 paaramparik khanan kshetra kaa bhi kaaphi dohan kar liya gaya he or yah kshetra gambhir kanoonee or paryaavaran se judi chunautiyon se ghira he
 These industries thrive on low-cost manual work, which is lacking in Goa
 soochna praudyogiki (ity) or biotechnology se jude udyogon sareekhe hitech udyog vikalp hai, magar iske liye baari-bharkam puunji nivesh or behatar shikshit kamgaaron kii jarurat he
 Another serious challenge for Goa is the sharp decline in agricultural productivity, due to excessive use of land and pollution
 goa kheti yogya jameen or khetihar mazdooron kii jabardast kami kaa saamana bhi kar rahaa he
 The share of agriculture in the state's net domestic product is less than 8 percent in the country
 krishi main goa ko jo akelaa tulanaatmak phayda hasil he, vah he nakad fasalon—yani kaashew, nariyal, supaari, katahal or kele sareekhee fasalon—kaa
 Goa needs to spread hands and feet in new agricultural produce through organic farming and agro-processing
 is sabake liye aadhunik technology or takneekon ke saath krishi main jabardast nivesh, krishi kaarybal ko shikshit karne or utpaadan ke sadhano donon main krantikari badlaav kii jarurat he
 *** indian institute of technology (IIT) ne aisi lagbhag 30 companiyon kaa naam public kar diya he, jo IIT ke students ko placement main job kaa ofer dekar baad main mukar gaye

 All IIT Placement Committee (AIPC) convenor Kaustubh Mohanty said in a conversation with the newspaper that 'there have been cases in which we have cobblelisted one or two companies, but this is happening for the first time when so many companies in a single year The decision to make the names of the companies listed in the blacklist public was taken by consensus
 ve galati karne waalon ko sakht sandesh dena chaahate hai

 Amid ongoing debate in the country over the fact that India does not have a single university in the list of the world's top 200 universities, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAC) said that the agencies that determine the global ratings of higher education institutions should be called developing countries like India
 According to the ground conditions, their parameters should be changed
 nack ke nideshak dhirendrapal singh ne kaha, ‘‘vishvavidhyalayon kii vaishvik ranking ke paimaane bharat jaise vikasshil deshon ke jamini halaat se kaaphi alag hai
 India and other developing countries like us need to increase communication with such ranking agencies so that these parameters can be changed according to the situation of developing countries

 For this, our universities have to put more emphasis on global participation in their campuses
 ’’ Director of Naik Dhirendrapal Singh said that out of 744 universities in the country, only 300 have been associated with Naik, while out of more than 40,000 colleges in the country, only about 7,000 are associated with Naik

 He said that in the current global ranking system of universities, its big marks are determined by how many countries students study in a university, how many Nobel Prize scholars have been associated with themselves and how many patents are registered in its name
 tippaniyan Singh said, "indian universities need to make more efforts to get ahead of other countries on these parameters

 UNAIDS, a UN body working on AIDS, also disagreed over Azad's remarks, saying there should be no discrimination between men on the basis of physical relationships
 samalangik samarthak kaaryakartaaon ne kaha ki aaazaad kaa bayaan ‘avaigyanik or ataarkik’ he
 Organizations emphasized the need for a change in the thinking of society

 rashtriya khel vikaas vidheyak ke lagu hone se khel sanghon par lagaam lagegi or bisisiai jaise dhankuber sanstha par bhi sarkaar kaa ankush lag sakegaa
 This bill could not get the approval of the cabinet because many ministers in the cabinet meeting objected to some provisions of this bill
 unhone kaha, mai samajhataa hum ki is vidheyak ko lagu karne main pehle hi kaaphi der chuki he
 We should have implemented this bill long ago, if this happens then the Commonwealth Games scam would not have happened and those who are in Tihar Jail today are not the officials of the Indian Olympic Association
 unhone kaha ki is vidheyak se khel sanghon ke artiai ke antargat aane se kaamkaaj main paardarshita or javabdehi aa sakegi
 The Sports Minister said that the purpose of bringing this bill is not for the government to control the sports federations

 According to the Xinhua news agency, the Nuclear and Industrial Security Agency has said that only 10 percent of the radiation from this disaster-prone plant has spread to the atmosphere, compared to the nuclear crash of the Charonabil

 a spokesperson for the Tokyo Electric Power Company (tepco), the operator of the plant, said that the side effects of the accident at the plant could be more than the charonabil
 samachar agency kyodo ke mutabik adhikariyon ne kaha, "vikiran kaa prasar puri tarah se nahin rukaa he or is baat kii chintaa barkaraar he ki risaav main teji se vruddhi ho sakati he or cheronabil ke str tak yaa usase zyada ho sakati he

 Senior agency official Hideko Nishiyama said that 29 people had died due to radiation effects in Charonabil, but no one has been seriously affected in Fukushima so far
 unhone kaha ki cheronabil main parmaanu riector fat gaya tha jabaki phukushima sanyantr hydrogen visphoton ke kaaran kshatigrast hua he
 Nishiyama said that increasing the level of the disaster would not affect the existing displacement area as the scope has been announced on the basis of uniform radioactive radiation

 maharashtra main shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane ko lekar congress ne party varking cameti (CWC) kii baithak ab khatm ho gai he
 After leaving the meeting, senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that the right aspects have been discussed in this meeting which started from 10 am
 aakhir main party ke varisht netaaon ne yah tay kiya he ki ham maharashtra congress ke netaaon ke saath baithak karne ke baad hi kisi faisle par pahunchenge
 He said that the party has called senior leaders of Maharashtra Congress for a meeting at four in the evening
 bataa den ki maharashtra main BJP sarkaar nahin banaaegi yah ab saaf ho gaya he
 In such a situation, everyone's eyes are now towards Shiv sena-congress and NCP
 NCP pramukh sharad pavaarane Shiv Sena ke saath sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar bada bayaan diya he
 He said that we are not going to take any decision to form the government without talking to the Congress
 udhar, congress party ne maharashtra ke maujuuda raajnneetik halaat ko lekar CWC kii baithak bulaai he
 In this meeting, the party will take a decision only after discussing with senior leaders of the party regarding support to Shiv Sena
 in sab ke bich,centre kii modi sarkaar main shaamil shivasena ke iklaute mantri arvind saavant ne istife kaa elaan kiya he
 Giving details of the resignation decision on Twitter, he said that Shiv Sena's side is the truth
 jhuthe maahaul ke saath nahin rahaa saktaa he
 Arvind Sawant said that he would press conference on this at 11 am
 yah faisla aise main unhone kiya he jab maharashtra main shivasena, congress or ensipi kii sarkaar banane kii khabaren hai
 With the announcement of Arvind Sawant's resignation, it has been decided that the Shiv Sena is out of the NDA
 shivasena or bijepi kii dosti 30 saal puraani thi
 It is believed that the NCP had put a condition before the Shiv Sena to form a government in Maharashtra that it would have to break ties with the NDA first
 haalanki maharashtra main shivasena or ensipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke bhi samarthan jarurat padegi
 But Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has said that the meeting is going to be held at 10 o'clock today and the decision will be taken according to the instructions of the high command
 lekin uske saath hi unhone kaha ki abhi tak kaa jo faisla he ki hamen vipaksh main hi baithna chahie
 Let us tell you that in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, BJP has got 105 seats, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44 seats
 bijepi or shivasena ne milakar bahumat kaa 145 kaa aankada paar kar liya tha
 But Shiv Sena kept demanding 50-50 formula according to which the model of running the government was two and a half years
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath samjhauta isi formule par hua tha lekin bijepi kaa daawa he ki aisa koi samjhauta nahin hua
 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken
 notebandi ke baad bharat main nakli noton ko khapaane ke taur-tareeke badal gaye hai
 The route for sending fake notes across the country including Delhi has also been changed
 pehle nepal, upi, kashmir or bengal hote hue nakli note bhartiya bazaaron main pahunchate the lekin ab inhen srilanka, bangladesh, malaysia or thailand ke raste bharat bheja ja rahaa he
 According to security agencies, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim is associated with the black trade of these fake notes and these notes are being printed in Karachi and Lahore only
 hindustan times ke mutabik, disipi special cell sanjeev yadav ne bataaya ki seemapar se pahunch rahi nakli noton kii khep ke saath hui giraftaareyon se paak khufia agency iesai kii sathganth kaa khulaasa hua he

 The first category in this is that of printing of notes

 Dawood Ibrahim is the biggest gang member of the third category, after the supply of fake consignments in the country reaches them in their Indian network and market
 sutron kii maane tonkali notake dhandhe main jude logon kii iesai dwaara madad kaa makasad bhartiya arthvyavastha ko tahas-nahas karnaa he
 The biggest name that comes up in this is that of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim
 ISI kii madad se bharat main failaae jate hai nakli notedaud ibrahim ke saath-saath aatanki sanghathan bhi bhartiya arthvyavastha ko nuksaan pahunchane main koi kasar nahin chhodte hai
 The Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, through its network, supplies fake notes to various parts of the country
 suraksha agenciyon kii maane to bharat main nakli noton kii supplai kaa sargana pakistan ke lahore main baitha ikbaal kaana he
 Sleeper cells of terrorist organizations also get help in this racket from the operatives of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim
 itnaa hi nahin, vibhinn aatanki sanghathanon ke sleeper cell ke logon ko bhi is network se joda gaya he
 Actually Iqbal Kana has created this black business of fake currency in India only through ISI network

 Tandwa Police Station Ajay Kumar was returning from a police jeep with policemen from a meeting of Navinagar Circle in Aurangabad, Bihar
 tabhi raste main barudi surang main visphot hua
 In this, eight policemen including the police station were killed
 isse teen din pehle hi munger jile ke jamalpur railway stesan se kuch dur pehle sahibganj-danapur intercity express par naksali hamale main biempi ke teen jawan shahid hue the jabaki ek mahila samet teen pulicekarmi ghayal ho gaye
 Police rifles were also looted by Naxalites
 munger or aurangabad jilon main naksali hinsa kii ghatnaayen nai nahin hai
 This is the latest link in the state government's poor system
 isse pehle 17 aktubar ko aurangabad ke obra main jila parshad ke pati susheel pandey samet saat logon ko maar diya gaya tha
 The weak will of the government is being blamed for the rising Naxalite spirits
 bihar ke purv police mahanideshak di
 P
 ojha kehete hai, ''sarkaar kii ichhashakti kamjor he, jisaki vajah se naksaliyon kaa manobal badha he
 The reason for increase in Naxal activities is 20 percent law and order and 80 percent socio-economic problem
 rajya sarkaar donon front par asafal he
 According to the Home Ministry report, Naxalite incidence has increased in Bihar this year as compared to last year
 2013 ke july maah tak 114 ghatnaayen ghat chuki hai
 Of these 34 people lost their lives, including 13 policemen
 pichley saal ke july tak ke aankade dekhen to 20 logon kii jaan gai thi
 Apparently there has been an increase in incidents of Naxalite violence in 2013
 july, 2012 or july, 2013 ke tulanaatmak akalan main naksali police par haaavee rahe hai
 According to the report, there was a Naxalite attack on the police last year, but till July this year there were six Naxalite attacks
 pichley saal paanch naksali maare gaye the, lekin is saal ek bhi naksali nahin maaraa gaya
 The reports of central intelligence agencies are shocking
 30 agast ko pradhananmatri, raksha mantralay or rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ko saunpi gai chah pannon kii khufia report main khulaasa kiya gaya he ki bihar sarkaar maovadiyon ke prati naram rukh apana rahi he
 Are the eastern regions of the Maoists being controlled from Bihar itself? Naxalites are working by dividing Bihar into seven zones
 is khufia report ke aadhaar par bihar vidhanmandal main vipaksh ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha, ''bihar sarkaar ke naram rukh kii vajah se rajya main naksaliyon ko paanv pasaarne kaa mauka mila he
 Even after the report became public, the Chief Minister continues to deny information
 '' khufia agenciyon kii sanyukt team main ibi or ro jaisi khufia agenciyaan shaamil hai
 Experts attribute the vote bank politics to the soft state government's stand
 tark he ki naksaliyon kaa thikaana pichhadaa ilaaka rahaa he
 The 22 districts of the state are Naxalite affected, of which a dozen districts are considered very sensitive
 rajya sarkaar naksaliyon ke khilaaf vishesh abhiyaan chalaane se parhez karti rahi he
 His problem is that there is not enough police
 bihar main police kii maujuudagi rashtriya ausat kii tulana main kaaphi kam he
 There are 125 policemen per one lakh population in the country, while in Bihar it is 84
 shahid hue tandva thanadhyaksh ajay kumaar ke pita shobhit poddar bhi maanate hai ki rajya sarkaar ko nitiyon main badlaav laana chahie taaki naksalgrast thanon main kisi daaroga or sipaahi kii posting lambey samay tak na rahe
 "they stay on target of Naxalites for long time," he says
 '' dedh saal pehle unke bete kii posting hui thi, jis dauraan usne naksaliyon ke daant khattey kar die the
 a few months ago i met the SP several times for transfer, but the reply was that there is no transfer line on the palm
 samay aayega, tabadalaa ho jayega
 The posted police are also working in the absence of training and resources
 yahi vajah he ki rajya sarkaar ne saat naksaliyon par teen se paanch lakh kaa inaam ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 But no arrest has been possible
 aisa dekha gaya he ki naksaliyon ke khilaaf karrwai se aamajanon kii mushkilen badi hai
 Even more worrying is that the insider system of Naxalites is becoming stronger than the police
 november main siarpief kii 159veen batalian ke assistant commandent sanjay kumaar yadav kii giraftaar se aisa hi jhatka laga
 Sanjay has been leaking information about anti-naxal operations for the past one year, due to which many police operations failed
 taaja ghatnaon se utpann halaat par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kehete hai, ''police naksali sanghathanon ke khilaaf search abhiyaan tej karegi
 Massive campaigns will be launched to arrest the Naxalites
 '' haalanki nitish kaa maananaa he ki police oparation hi naksali samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hai
 He said, "work should be done at political, administrative and economic levels to solve the Naxalite problem
 iske liye prayaas chal rahe hai
 "the state government has changed the policies for surrender and rehabilitation of left-wing extremists
" samarpan karanevaale ugravadiyon kii protsaahan raashi dhai lakh ru

 pradesh ke jalon jile main khud ko sattaruq samaajawaadee party (sapa) kaa vidhayak bataakar police va prashasnic adhikariyon ko dhamkaane vaale farji vidhayak ko giraftaar kar jail bhej diya
 Superintendent of Police Rakesh Shankar said that Yashveer Singh Gautam, a resident of Madaripur, called himself SP MLA and called on different numbers and used to pressurize the administrative and police officers and pressurize them to do illegal work
 unhone bataaya ki police ne jila intelligence team ke prabharee lakshmi swaroop mittal ko is maamle kaa padaarfash karne ke nirdesh die gaye the
 On this, the Intelligence team arrested the fake SP MLA from his ancestral village and sent him to jail on Tuesday
 'aap' kaa kya hoga? philhal yeek bada sawaal he
 Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi and is also the convenor of AAP
 sawaal ek vyakti ke donon padon par rahane par uthaae gaye hai
 The party is becoming person-centered - this is the biggest question raised
 ek sambhaavna ye he ki sawaal-jawaab hote rahenge, party bhi chalati rahegi
 In a democratic set up, they are like a deterrent
 sawaal uthaane kii gunjaaish jitani rahegi dhaancha utana hi majboot rahegaa
 The democratic health of the party will be equally healthy
 loktantr kii yahi khubsuurati he
 Otherwise, who can stop being a ruined Gulistan
 buudhvaar, 4 march ko aam aadmi party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak bulaai gai he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who has remained silent till now on the rise of AAP, has said in the tweet, "I am very sad and hurt by whatever is happening in the party
" dilli kii janata ne ham par jo bharosa jataayaa he, usase dhokhaa he
 "this meeting will be hot, this thing is guaranteed
" aaie ab is prastaavit meeting ke swaroop or sambhaavnaaon ko samajhane kii koshish karte hai -1
 Maybe Yogendra Yadav should keep himself away from the meeting
 itnaa to tay he ki is baithak main yogendra yadav sabake nishane par honge
 The tape will be narrated in the meeting which is a recording of the conversation between the AAP worker and a journalist
 yogendra yadav par lagaae gaye aaropon main se ek ye he ki unhone media main party ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali khabaren parosi
 These tapes will be presented as evidence of the allegations
 prashanth bhushan apane purv nirdhaarit kaarykram kii baat kah baithak main aane se pehle hi manaa kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, Yogendra can fall alone in the meeting, so he can find an excuse to stay away
 2
 Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan may be removed from the Political Affairs Committee
 jaisi ki khabaren aa rahi hai
 Their opponents say that as long as these people stay in the PAC, they will keep disturbing, so it will be in the party's interest to get rid of them as soon as possible
 loktantr main kisi ke khilaaf karrwai se pehle use apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya jaataa he or arvind kejariwal iske pakshdhar bhi hai
 In such a situation, it may also happen that a show cause notice is issued against both of them and they are given a chance to present their case
 3
 May be Yogendra Yadav returns to the backfoot
 yogendra yadav ne somvaar ko ek twit main kaha tha, "'yah vaqt badi jeet ke baad bade man se, bade kaam karne kaa he
 The country has raised great expectations from us
 choti harkaton se khud ko or is aashaa ko chota na karen
 "though these words can have hundreds of meanings, but if they are understood directly, then it seems that Yogendra Yadav does not want to quarrel
 jaisaa ki wo baahar bhi kehete rahete hai ki 'abhi ham naye naye hai
 Now we are learning '- and on the same line in the party forum, let us say that whatever was on his mind, he said that, his intention is neither to harm the party nor to hurt anyone
 iske saath hi sijafire ho jaae
 4
 ho saktaa he arvind kejariwal sanyojak kaa pad chhod den
 In a tweet, Kejriwal says: "I will not get into this quarrel, but will focus on running the government in Delhi
" janata ke bharose ko kisi bhi haalat main nahin tuutane duungaa
 'it is possible that Kejriwal will take the initiative to hold elections inside the party for the new convenor, which hardly anyone can resist
 sab kuch thik thaak chalata rahe iske liye kejariwal kaa ek loktantric or raajnneetik kadam ye bhi ho saktaa he
 5
 ho saktaa he koi bich kaa rasta nikaala jaae
 Just like Kejriwal has handed over the entire portfolio to Manish Sisodia while being the Chief Minister of Delhi, similarly he should hand over the responsibilities by making some co-convenors in the party
 aise main yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko sah-sanyojak yaa varisht sah-sanyojak ke pad ofer kiye jaaen
 The matter will be made only if they accept this position
 raajnneeti main kuch samasyon kaa ek hal ye bhi hota he ki samaadhaan ko taal diya jaae
 Former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao applied this formula a lot and he also benefited from it
 mumkin he kejariwal bhi is maamle main 'wet and vaach' kaa rasta akhriyaar kar len
 Anyway, Kejriwal is going on 10 days leave for treatment from March 5

 DMRC has said that it will also give 100 buses
 5
 Like the last time, do not charge extra charge for hailstorms and uber, Delhi government will also take care of this
 shuukravaar ko isi sambandh main ola-ubar ke saath baithak kii jaaegi
 6
 aam aadmi party sarkaar dilli main teesri baar od-ivan formula lagu karne ja rahi
 Earlier, two more Delhiites had taken out their vehicles keeping in mind the odd-even
 7
 In 2016, its first phase was implemented from January 1 to January 15 and the second phase from April 15 to April 30
 8
 Environmental experts believe that with the implementation of the odd-even formula, about one million private vehicles disappear from the roads
 lihaaja is formule se naa keval yaatyaat main jabardast kami aati he saath hi shahar main pradooshan kaa badhata str bhi kam hone kii ummid hoti he
 9
 buudhvaar ko dilli sachivalay main baithak ke dauraan trephic police, parivahan or paryaavaran vibhaag ke saath od-ivan par charchaa ke baad yah faisla liya gaya he
 10
 sienji vaahanon ke liye har district ke do sienji panpon par steekar milenge
 CNG stickers will be available at 22 stations in Delhi from 2 pm tomorrow
 sienji vaahanon par od-ivan formula lagu nahin hoga
 This is od-even means odd-even means that the last number of your car's number plate is even or odd
 is formule main dilli kii sadakon par ek din od or uske agle din ivan number kii gaadiyaan chalaane kaa niyam hota he
 In the language of mathematics, 1,3,5,7 and 9 are called odd numbers
 isi tarah 2,4,6,8 or 0 ko ivan number kaha jaataa he
 If the last number of your car's number plate is odd (1,3,5,7,9), then you are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 and 31 can drive on the same date

 The issue has sparked debate across the country since the Agra conversion case
 sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr bhi is mudde se garm he
 The entire opposition surrounds the government
 apane bayanon ke liye khyath piem is maamle main “manmohan” se ho gaye hai
 On the other hand, the Shiv Sena has now questioned the intention of the Center and the BJP
 shivasena ke mukh patr saamana main bijepi kii kendra sarkaar ko sawaalon ke ghere main khadaa kiya gaya he
 The editorial in Saamna on conversion has praised the enthusiasm of Hinduist organizations but doubts have been raised on the government's intention
 shivasena kahati he ki kahin aisa to nahi ki ye utsaah modi sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban jaye? baat galat nahi he, jab se kendra main bijepi kii sarkaar ai he desh main hinduvaadi sanghathanon ke haunsale buland hai
 Every week, a minister or a leader of the government is creating a new controversy with rhetoric
 jo vipaksh baari bahumat vaali sarkaar ke saamne khud ko kamazor mahasoos kar rahaa tha, use khud sarkaar ke kaarindon ne hi mudde plate main rakh kar paros diye hai
 Modi is now instructing his government's ministers, mps and party leaders not to speak furiously
 vipaksh kii maang ke baavjood ve dharmantaran ke masale par khamoshi akhriyaar kiye baithe hai
 Uttar Pradesh Governor Ram Naik has also been given a place in the editorial
 khud ko ram mandir kaa pujari bataane vaale nik ke bare main kaha gaya he ki ram nik jo kehete hai usamen harj hi kya he? bhale hi wo aaj rajyapal hon, lekin ve sangh ke swanyasevak hai or mandir andolan ke car sevak bhi
 The Shiv Sena has made it clear that the way Hinduist organizations have made conversions a mission, does it have the support of the government? Actually, not only Shiv Sena but this question is arising in the minds of many people
 sarkaar kii chuppi bhi is maamle main sandigdh he
 However, on the uproar in the Agra case, Amit Shah had said that forced conversion was not acceptable
 lekin baavjood iske desh ke kai hisson main chal rahi 'ghar vaapasi' kii taiyaari kis taraf ishaara kar rahi he? The stock markets of the country turned bullish on Tuesday

 shauchalay desh ke liye kitne jaruri he
 Its latest example is presented by a woman living in Vidarbha district of Maharashtra
 is mahila neshauchalay banavaane ke liqupana mangalsutra bech diya
 After this admirable work of the woman, she is being praised all around
 gramin vikaas mantri pankaja munde ne unhen badhai di he
 Sangeeta Avhle of Sikhhar village of Washim in Vidarbha district recently set a unique example of social revolution by building toilets at home, emphasizing the dignity of women
 mahila ne bataaya ki uske pati ne ghar main shauchalay banavaane kii uski maang kii andekhi kii
 His father-in-law also did not support him
 kisi bhi parivaar kii aadharbhoot jarurat shauchalay he, jevar nahin
 i sold a gold mangalsutra to build a toilet in my house
 mahila ke is kadam kii prashansa karte hue munde ne kaha ki rajya main ham zyada se zyada sankhya main shauchalay banvaanaa chaahate hai or is baat se aashwast karnaa chaahate hai ki mahilaon ko ab sharmidagi jhelane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Input IANS reatin2 stardiarectorpavan kriplanikalakaarradhika aptekai filmon main diarector darshakon ke dhairya kii pariksha lene ke maamle main had se guzar jate hai, or aisa hi kuch phobia ke bare main bhi he
 For a long time there was chaos that Phobia is a low budget and thriller
 film ke horer factor ko bhi ubhaara ja rahaa tha
 There was also talk of suspense
 vivaadon kii vajah se surkhiyon main rahane vaali radhika apte ko is film kaa eks factor mana ja rahaa tha
 But when i saw the film, this phrase started echoing in the mind - Thotha Chana Baje Ghane
 film puri tarah se kanphyus he
 The directors have not been able to understand what they want to show
 kehane ke liye psychological thriller, lekin sir ko baari kar detii he
 How much of the story in the story is the story of Radhika Apte
 jo ek painter he or bahut acha kaam karti he
 But one night she falls victim to an accident with a taxi driver and her entire life changes
 use agraphobia ho jaataa he
 She lives alone in the house
 kahin nahin jaati he
 Seeing unknown people starts to panic
 uske ghar vaale or dost uski madad karne kii koshish karte hai
 When there is no result, it is kept in a house alone
 jahaan vah apni hi ek alag duniya or kahaniyaan gadhane lagati he
 He feels that someone has been killed
 uskaa padosi kaatil he
 Then he starts suspecting his friend too
 kai jagah to film kamedi tip ho jaati he
 Overall, the director could neither make it a thriller nor a film that could tie it
 diarector ek behtareen film banane se chook gaye
 Star Appeal As far as acting is concerned, Radhika Apte prevails in the film
 unke saath kuch kalakaar aate hai
 Which does not seem to require much to know
 sara kaam radhika apte ke jimme he, lekin ek uljhi hui kahani main ve jitani jaan daal sakati thim, ve us koshish main safal rahi hai
 They have given very good expressions like fearing, getting confused and scared
 lekin kai jagah unke hansane, rone or darane ke expreshans ek jaise hi lagane lagate hai
 Overall, the film generates curiosity when Radhika succumbs to agoraphobia
 lekin uske baad diarector ko samaj hi nahin aata ki ve kya dikhaaen
 Sometimes when they try to put a touch of horror, they convert the scene into a joke
 phir ve kuch aise halaat banaate hai, jo kahin se bhi conect nahin karte hai, or psychological thriller main hamaari psychology kii pariksha hone lagati he
 It may be natural to have phobias from such films after watching the film
 agle maheene 5 april ko relies ho rahi piem narendra modi kii byopic relies se pehle charchaa main he
 However, opposition parties have also complained to the Election Commission to stop the release of the film
 hoicourt main bhi yachika daayar kar film kii relies par bain lagane kii maang kii gai he
 Meanwhile, a new promo video of the film on the political life of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been released
 promo video main 2002 main hue godhra ko lekar sawaal or us par pradhanmantri ke jawaab ko dikhaaya gaya he
 In a 16-second promo, the journalist asks Vivek Oberoi, who is playing the role of PM Modi, why have you not apologized for Godhra till date? Modi's reply is, "apology begs the culprit, law proof
 agar maine jurm kiya he to faansee par lataka do
 "after the promo, the debate on the film is likely to intensify
 “maafi gunehgaar maangta hai aur kanoon saboot”

 Whether the youth of the country or the women power or the shining stars of the silver screen, are willing to join the new stream of politics with equal rights
 so, rahul gandhi ke ranneetikaar or kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne dangon kii siyasat ko khaarij karte hue mana, ''1984 ke dange ham par kalank hai

 "but when a Congress leader sitting in the audience gallery questioned the Sikh society's faith in the Congress despite the anti-sikh riots and the Muslim society's continued distance from the BJP, Shah said," The Modi government was the only Muslim community vote in 2014
 Going to be ”jairam ramesh ne gujarat dangon ke maamle main esaity se modi ko mili clin chit ko jhuthlaayaa to shah ne kadaa etraj jataate hue kaha, ''jakiya jaafaree cese main esaity ne saaf kaha ki prosicute karne laayak kuch nahin he
 Gujarat government did not make this SIT

 The verdict arrived in lower court, Modi was acquitted
 phir bhi congress mudda uthaakar dhurveekaran kar rahi he
 "but Ramesh read the excerpt from the SIT report saying that while acquitting it, it has also been said about Modi that his criminal involvement cannot be denied
" shah ne aakraamak andaaj main un aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya ki dangon ke baad modi kisi danga peedit se milane nahin gaye
 At first Ramesh refused to consider this election as Rahul versus Modi, but on the question of giving prominence to Rahul in the campaign, he did not refrain from confessing that Congress in its first phase of campaigning Rahul Gandhi to Modi and Arvind Kejriwal Wants to show as a different personality
 ramesh ne rahul ko raajnneeti kaa marathon bataaya jo kejariwal kii 100 meter kii daud se alag hai
 On this platform, the new jumbo of politics was 60 years vs
 60 months vs
 60 days, then the question arose as to who is better than the congress-bjp and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)

 He has spoken of doing so much work in 60 months that people will gain confidence

 "but on bringing the Gujarat model into the country, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Manish Tewari said that it will destroy the country, while AAP leader Rahul Mehra also said that AAP did not say 60 days, but rather The faith of the people was over, which had awakened and now people are connecting with democracy

 Possibilities of a Third Front were also explored on this platform between Modi vs Rahul
 jedy (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ne kaha ki jaise congress main ek bambu par tambu (gandhi parivaar) he, ab bijepi bhi uski nakal kar rahi he jo uski taasir nahin he
 But he should not forget that no one wins in the other's arena
 lekin achaanak congress kaa graph kyon gira or chaar rajyon main party kyon haari
 Was inflation the reason? On this question, Union Minister of State and Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot confessed to inflation as a reason, he even gave his NCP quota associate Tariq Anwar, sitting on the stage, a plan to distribute it in public instead of wasting grains

 This time there is no such violence in the Lok Sabha elections, but in the 2019 elections, if the eyes of most people are focused on a state, then it is only West Bengal

 After boarding the plane, set designer Aparna Sood made sure that everything from the bathroom to the intercom and the drinking water machine worked properly

 madhavani kehete hai, ''haalanki jindagi kii or itihaas kii sachaai main meri dilchaspee he, magar meri dilchaspee manovaigyanik or jajbaton kii sachaai main bhi he
 One way to show this is that the character did this or that the character felt or thought so

 Rangarajan said at the Maharashtra Economic Summit here last night, the current account deficit increased to 3 in the first half of the current financial year
 7 pratishat tak pahunch gaya

 diemke ke divangat netaa em karunanidhi ke 60 saal ke raajnneetik jivan main vaise to kai bade ghatnakram rahe hai
 But there are two chances of his political journey - first the ouster of MG Ramachandran (MGR) from DMK in 1972 and the second attempt to merge AIADMK with DMK in 1979
 ji haa aaj ke daur main lagbhag asambhav se lagane vaale is prayaas ko purv kendriya mantri or odisha ke mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke pita biju patnayak ne 1979 main lagbhag sambhav kar diya tha
 This was the period when a non-congress government was formed at the Center for the first time and there was uncertainty in the politics of the states
 is daur main rajyon kii swaayatata ko lekar karunanidhi ek mukhar pairokaar the
 Let us know that MGR, the actor-turned-politician, founded AIADMK in 1972 due to differences with Karunanidhi
 party kii sthapana ke paanch saal baad hi mjiaar kii ediemke tamilnadu kii satta par kabiz ho gai
 MGR had supported the Charan Singh government at the Center and when the next election was on the head, MGR came in contact with Indira Gandhi seeing the possible withdrawal
 lekin jab indira or mjiaar kii prastaavit baithak sambhav nahin ho pai tab charan singh sarkaar main mantri rahe biju patnayak ne diemke or ediemke ke vilay kaa prastaav rakhaa
 On this proposal of Patnaik, when Karunanidhi asked who was behind it? Patnaik then replied that MGR wants this and also wants to know what is your opinion on it
 karunanidhi is shart par taiyaar ho gaye ki diemke kaa naam barkaraar rahegaa vahiin party kaa jhanda ediemke kaa hoga
 Karunanidhi also said that MGR can continue as the Chief Minister after the merger while Karunanidhi will command the party
 jiske baad patnayak ne chepak guest house main donon dalon ke pramukhon kii meeting karwaai
 DMK general secretary k Anbazhagan and AIADMK general secretaries VR Nedunchezhiyan and p Ramachandran were present on the occasion
 jabakiemjiaar or karunanidhike bich band kamare main baithak hui
 The two leaders, after agreeing on an agreement, decided to convene an emergency meeting of the party executive in which the resolution of merger of the two parties was to be passed
 lekin kuch hi ghanton baad mjiaar ke vichaar badal gaye jab vellore kii ek jansabha main mjiaar ne to manch se vilay ke sambandh main kuch nahin kaha lekin ediemke ke anya netaaon ne diemke kii aalochana kii
 With this, this chapter of merger also ended
 mjiaar ke saath hui is baithak ke 30 saal baad saal 2009 main karunanidhi ne ek avasar par yah khulaasa kiya tha ki mjiaar ke cabinet mantri ne hi vilay ke mansoobon par pani pher diya
 Karunanidhi had also said that he suspected that this would have happened between mgr's meeting to the Vellore public meeting
 is baithak main maujuud rahe ediemke netaa pi ramchandran ne daawa kiya ki unhone hi mjiaar ke vichaar yah kahkar badal die ki donon dalon ke vilay ke uparant ediemke caderon kaa koi mahatv nahin rah jayega
 Ramachandran understood this about MGR and abandoned the idea of merger

 He said that if there is any activity in India and Pakistan for a comprehensive dialogue then other countries can help but its process will be decided by the partner countries
 bharat main niyukt norge ke rajdoot niles ragonar kamsavag ne baad main ek twit main yah spasht kiya ki solberg ne bharat or pakistan ke bich madhyasth banane kii peshkash nahin kii he
 When Solberg was asked if a military solution was possible in the Kashmir Valley, he replied, "I personally do not believe that problems can be solved in a military way
" main shantipurna samaadhaan main vishwaas rakhti hum
 i believe in the participation of women and youth in peace talks

 At least 18 Taliban, including some foreign terrorists, were killed in several drone attacks on 2 campuses of the al-qaeda affiliate 'haqqani Network' and another terrorist base in Pakistan's troubled North Waziristan region

 Democracy basically rests on questions, criticism, opposition and fair elections (in which denial or acceptance is hidden) from a government

 Why? If the representatives of the public will not ask questions, then who will ask? America's presidential democracy does not have a question hour

 court ne kaha ki yah shikaayat primaor thi kyonki tab film bani nahin thi or duusari baat he ki agar film main kuch aapattijanak he to yah sensor board tay karegaa ki film relies ho yaa nahin ho

 hoicourt ne yah bhi kaha ki rani padmini dharmik paatr nahin thim, balki aitihaasik charitra thim
 Therefore, there is no case of hurting religious sentiments
 sensor board ek independent sanstha he or sab kuch dekhne ke baad hi certificate diya he
 If there is any object in it, then it can be challenged

 inkhiya is badlaav ke peeche kuch or vajahen bhi dekhte hai
 One of them is the growing agricultural sector here
 ve kehete hai, ''jaisalmer jaise marusthali jile main nabbe ke dashak se shuru hue bhoojal aadhaarit krishi kaary ne isamen ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 "tube-based farming started in the Chandan region of Jaisalmer district has now reached the Basia region extending from the central part of the district to the south-west

 rathod ise rekhaankit karte hai, ''barish sab ore baraabar nahin ho rahi he
 There may be local reasons behind this
 is sambandh main abhi sahi vajahon kaa pataa nahin lag paaya he
 Research is still going on
 ” unke hisaab se bhi global varming ek vajah ho sakati he
 Rathore says that the rains are getting plentiful but the days of rains have reduced
 yani jis din varsha shuru hoti he, to baari varsha hoti he
 In this way it also becomes the cause of loss of life and property
 ''pichley saal nagaur main kai ilaake sookhe rah gaye jabaki kai ilaakon main baari barish hui
 Similarly, due to lack of rain in many areas of Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Barmer, the state government had to declare those villages as famine-stricken
 ”ulataa-pulatakhaiyr, registan main varsha kaa ausat badaae se khushhaali to jarur ai he lekin yah badhata str registan ko na keval khatm kar rahaa he balki shushk kshetra main pai jane vaali anaaj or pashuon kii kai prajatiyon ke liye bhi astitv kaa sankat khadaa kar rahaa he
 Also, the sequence of crops has been badly affected
 krishi vaigyanik salaah dete hai ki anukool taapmaana ke dauraan 5 se 20 aktubar ke darmyaan sarson kii buaai kar lee jaani chahie, lekin ab vaisaa taapmaana november main aane laga he
 The wheat crop needs an average temperature of 22 degrees and November is considered suitable for sowing due to this
 par pichley do-teen saal se vaisaa taapmaana disambar main jaakar mil rahaa he
 The dwindling desert has also affected tourism
 jaisalmer ghoomane aae gujarat ke vadodara ke pankaj shah kehete hai, ''desert ke bare main kaaphi sun rakhaa tha, so bivi or bete ke saath aa pahunchaa par yahaan to sam or khuhadi ilaake main hi thodi-bahut ret najar ai
 "the Thar Desert is now moving towards Pakistan

 Now farmers feel that they have been cheated

 Now the situation is that despite the full use of tubewells and fertilizing the soil, the former will not be able to shine in the ground

 The name of that trick is Miranda trick
 jo dadar main aaj bhi he
 Bal Thackeray's father Prabodhankar Thackeray wrote in his biography Majhi Biography, that he had two floors on the ground in Miranda Chawl
 ye chaal sau se bhi zyada puraani he ab ek-aadh ghar hi aisa bachaa he jo apane puraane swaroop main kaayam he
 Most people have made changes inside the houses
 baahar kaa strecchar jahaan pehle puri tarah lakdi hua karti thi ab adhiktar hissaa lohe kaa bana diya gaya he
 But some part is exactly the same
 chaal main 10*10 ke kamare hai
 There is a one room kitchen inside the houses
 lekin bollroom sabhi pariwaron ke bich main ek hota he
 The Miranda Chal is the structure of Ground Plus 2
 yahaan har floor par ek bollroom he
 Thackeray, the seed of enlightenment of South Indians, was a big social reformist of that era and also wrote Marathi plays
 lekin parivaar ko paalane ke liye us kamai se puraa nahin ho paata tha
 Therefore, till late in the night, the enlightened people used to do separate typing work
 itnaa zyada ki typing karne se unki ankhen kharaab ho gayi thim
 At that time, the Miranda Chal used to live mostly in Malayali and Tamil people
 prabodhankaar thakare apni aatmakatha ‘majhi jeevanagaatha’ main bataate hai mirada chaal main rahane vaale dakshin bharatiyon se nahaane se pehle tel lagane kii aadat ko lekar thakare parivaar kaa jhagada rahata tha
 Chawl has a common bathroom for everyone
 tel lagaakar nahaane se prabodhan thakare ko lagata tha baad main nahaane vaale duusare log bollroom main phisal sakate hai
 But Chawl residents did not listen to them and said that bathing with oil is the custom in South India
 unhen sabak sikhaaneke liye thakare parivaar ne apane ghar ke aage meet ke tukade rakhane shuru kar die
 This angered his vegetarian neighbors
 jab unhone etraj jataayaa to thakare parivaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki ye hamaara rivaaj he
 It is believed that he had seeds against the South Indians from here
 shivasena ke gathan ke baad bal thakare ne dakshin bharatiyon ke khilaaf naaraa diya tha bajaao pungi uthaao lungi
 Even an elderly living in Miranda Chawl did not see the Thackeray family living here with his own eyes, but everyone has heard the stories of their parents, grandparents living with them
 miranda chaal se jane ke baad kabhi bal thakare yaa parivaar kaa koi vyakti yahaan nahin aayaa
 But the people of Chal tell proudly that they once lived with the Thackeray family
 bal thakare or telephone diarectoribal thakare kii larger dain life image rahi he
 Such a person who used to speak in Mumbai
 dhak aisi ki koi samakaleen netaa unke dur dur tak nahin tha
 The president of a political party who used to say very arrogantly that he does not believe in democracy
 uskaa bas chale to wo desh ko thokashahi se chalaae
 Worth seeing was the upbringing of Bala Saheb walking with Rutabe and Lav Lashkar in an absolutely middle class atmosphere
 bal thakare padhane main ek ausat (average) chaatr the lekin bahut creative the
 Used to make very good cartoons
 desh duniya main kya chal rahaa he is par unki pakad rahati thi, ghor anti communist the
 When Bala Saheb got a job in Free Press Journal, then he started his magazine poignant
 yaheen se unki jindagi main bhi bade badlaav aane shuru hue
 It is said that one day Bala Saheb carefully looked at the telephone directory of Mumbai
 jisamen marathiyon ke naam gine-chune the or sari telephone doirectory dakshin bharatiyon ke naam se bhari padi thi
 Most of the government jobs were occupied by South Indians in Mumbai at that time
 un dinon main telephone hona ek states simbel tha
 Even though the number of Marathis in Mumbai was high, they were not in the elite class despite being SON OF THE SOIL
 marathi nichle darje ke kaamon main zyada the
 Whereas the South Indians going to tie the office were
 bala sahib ko ye baat bahut chubh gai
 Telephone directory reached Marathi youth through poignancy, it was clear that the government jobs in Mumbai were occupied by outsiders and South Indians and only the lower class, low class jobs were part of the Marathas
 thakare ko ye baat nashtar kii tarah chubhi
 He printed the names of South Indians and details of their positions in the poignant
 neeche capshan main 'padho or chup raho' (vaachaa ani thand basaa)
 For a few days, Balasaheb continued to print the list of names of different government departments and the South Indians working in it
 dhire–dhire ye baat berozegaar marathi yuvaaon kaa khun khaulane lagi
 Listing in the poignant, he began to believe that South Indians were eating their jobs
 bala sahib ne nae nae dakshin bhartiya naamon ke saath list chhapana jari rakhaa lekin capshan badal diya
 Now the caption was read and grow (the covenant rose)
 After this, a crowd of unemployed youth started coming out of the office of Parmik
 bala sahib kii wo telephone doirectory marathi yuvaaon ke dilo-dimag ko jhakzor kar rahi thi
 Crowds of Marathi youths gathered in front of Rose Marmik
 thakare ke pita prabodhan thakare ko bhi laga ki is urja, is urja aavesh ko bekaar nahin jane dena chahie
 Shivaji Park was filled in the first rally itself
 On 19 June 1966, Shiv Sena was formed in the presence of only 18 people by bursting a coconut at 9
30 am
 prabodhan thakare ne party ko shivasena naam diya
 4 months after the formation of the party, Thackeray announced through a poignant that the Shiv Sena's first rally would be held at Shivaji Park on Dussehra
 kuch dinon baad kisi ne unase kaha ki shivaji park jaisi badi jagah par pehali hi raily karnaa thik nahin
 They should keep a small ground where people will come even if they come less
 par 1966 main hui shivasena kii pehali raily main itane log jute ki shivaji maidan chota pad gaya
 There was tremendous enthusiasm among the people who gathered at the first rally of Shiv Sena
 bala sahib ke bhaashan ke baad marathi yuva ijane josh se labarej ho gaye vastav main kahenge ki bhadak gaye ki shivaji park se nikalakar mattunga main dakshin bharatiyon kii dukaanon ke saath tod phod kii
 This series of sabotage continued for a long time after Balasaheb's rallies
 china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing ne kaha ki pipuls libration army (piele) ko ‘kshetreey yuddh’ jeetne kii taiyaari rakhni chahie or yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki kendriya netritv ke sabhi faislon kaa sakhti se paalan ho
 Central Military Commission (CMC) President and Communist Party of China secretary-general Xi said, "PLA Force Headquarters should have total loyalty and strong faith in the Communist Party of China"
 yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki kendriya netritv ke sabhi faislon kaa puri tarah karyanvayan ho
 "the People's Liberation Army Force Headquarters should improve their combat preparedness and increase their ability to win regional wars in the Information and Technology era," the government dialogue committee Xinhua quoted Xi as returning from a three-day visit to India last week
 
 shi ne ‘kshetreey yuddh’ jeetne ko lekar haalanki pehali baar aisa bayaan nahin diya he, lekin vaastavik niyantran rekha par bhartiya kshetra main china dwaara baar-baar kii ja rahi ghuspaith ke maddenjar unka yah bayaan kaaphi myne rakhata he
 According to the official statement, all PLA forces should follow President Xi's instructions and improve their operations to achieve the new goals and missions set by the CMC
 haalanki abhi tak yah spasht nahin ho sakaa he ki purna nishtha or kaman ke sucharu karyanvayan hetu adeshon ke paalan par itnaa jor kyon diya ja rahaa he
 These instructions from Chinese President Xi Chinfing came at a time when there is a deadlock between the PLA and the Indian Army on the Line of Actual Control in Chumar area of ladakh region
 is gatirodh main somvaar ko ek nayaa mode aayaa jab piele ne bhartiya seemaa ke bheetar saat tambu laga die or vahaan se hatane kaa bhi koi sanket najar nahin aa rahaa he
 61-year-old Xi has acquired the image of China's most powerful leader after former President Deng Shaoping, from the very first day of assuming power, with the right to hold the presidency, CPC and the military trio
 deng, maao ke baad desh ke raashtrapati bane the
 Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao did not receive all three rights simultaneously
 satta sanbhaalane ke baad se hi shi ne sena ke padon main badlaav karte hue apane prati vafaadaar generalon ko sheersh padon par niyukt kiya he or piele ke kuch generalon ko hataaya he tathaa bhrashtachar ke aarope main un par mukadmaa bhi chalaaya he
 PLA chief General Fang Fengui had said in a statement that all the forces of the PLA follow the instructions of President Xi, the chairman of the CMC
 siemasi china kii sena kaa alaakaman he
 Fang had said that the forces should improve their operations to achieve the new goals and missions set by the CMC
 is bich ‘piele chinas of staff’ ne beijing main baithak kar nai paristhitiyon main sena kii dakshata badhaane ke tareekon par charchaa kii
 Fang also attended this meeting
 cricket kaa jaadu vaaki sir chadhakar bolta he or jab baat austrailia or bharat ke bich test shrinkhalaa kii ho to kehane hi kya
 Its hallmark was also seen during the Commonwealth Games today when the eyes of Australian journalists came for coverage in India on the Internet
 austrailia test par tiki thi
 The Australians, who were getting information from ball to ball, were praising VVS Laxman besides praising his team's victory
 chot ke baavjood khelte hue lakshmana ne bharat ko jeet kii dahalij tak pahunchaaya
 Laxman, who scored 281 in the Kolkata Test against Steve Wa's team, was dubbed the Very Very Special by the Australian media
 sidney se aaye feirfaks radia ke patrkaar olds mure ne bhashaa se kaha, ‘lakshmana vaaki special he
 We thought that we will win this match but once again Laxman came in the way
 vah karishmai khilaadi he
