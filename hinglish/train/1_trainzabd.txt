 Team India is amazing The top order in the league matches was going on in excellent form, but when it came to their performance in important knockout matches like semi-finals, it flopped badly
 sheersh kram is kadar ladkadaaya ki world cap ke nokout mukaable main yah ab tak kii sabase kharaab shuruuaat ke rup main darj ho gaya
 On the second day of the rain-interrupted match at Manchester's Old Trafford Stadium, the Indian bowlers bowled tightly to restrict New Zealand to 239 runs
 bharat ko final main pahunchane ke liye 50 over main 240 ran banane the, lekin toornament ke nirnaayak match main bharat kaa sheersh kram aayaa ram-gaya ram banakar rah gaya
 India lost the match by 18 runs due to the disappointing performance of the batsmen and ended up reaching the final
 ummid pe duniya kaayam he! - yahaan badhayen hausala19 gendon main 3 attackebhartiya pari kii shuruuaat karne rohit sharma ke saath lokesh rahul krij par aae
 The way he had played in the World Cup so far, it was expected that both batsmen would advance the scoreboard giving the team a modest start
 lekin aisa nahin hua or pari kii naunvin gend par tej gendbaaj mat henry ne rohit sharma (1) ko wicket ke peeche kaich out kara diya
 Rohit, who scored a record 5 centuries in the World Cup, went on to score just 1 run today
 is shuruaati jatke ke baad team india sanbhalane main juty hi thi ki phir agle over main trent bolt ne captain viraat kohli ko pagabaadha kar diya
 He too went on to score just 1 run
 semifinal jaise mukaable main mahaj 5 ran par 2 wicket khone ke baad team india ko lokesh rahul se aas thi, lekin vah bhi wicket ke peeche lapke gaye
 Lokesh also went on to score just 1 run
 rohit 4 gendon main 1, captain viraat kohli 6 gendon main 1 or lokesh rahul 7 gendon main 1 ran banaakar pavilion laut gaye
 India lost 3 big wickets in just 19 balls
 bharat semifinal se pehle mahaj 1 match ganvaakar ankatalika main sheersh par rahi thi, lekin nirnaayak mukaable main sheersh kram ke flop sho ne har kisi ko niraash kar diya
 Worst performance This is the worst performance ever in a World Cup semi-final or knockout match
 isse pehle 1996 ke world cap mohali main khele gaye ek semifinal match main westeindies ke khilaaf australia kii shuruyaat behad kharaab hui thi
 Batting first, the Kangaroo team lost 3 wickets for just 8 runs
 baad main team ne 50 over main 8 wicket par 207 ran banaae or yah muqabla 5 ran ke antar se jeet liya
 However, after taking the first 3 major setbacks in the knockout match, only Australia's team has managed to win the match
 iske alaava 2011 ke world cap ke quarter final main pakistan ke khilaaf westeindies ne 16 ran par 3 wicket kho die, baad main team ko haar bhi mili
 Click on this link to encourage Team India, same thing happened with England and South Africa respectively in the semi-finals of 1975 and 2007 and both teams lost 3 wickets for just 26 runs against Australia

 RSS ke sar sanghachaalak mohan bhagwat kaa 11 sitambar 1950 ko hua janmapashu chikitsa main snaatak ke baad piji kii padhai chhod sangh se jude bhagwatmohan raav bhagwat ke pita madhukar bhagwat gujarat ke the pratham praant prachaarkarashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke sar sanghachaalak mohan raav bhagwat buudhvaar (11 sitambar) ko 69 varsh ke ho gaye
 Born in Chandranagar, Maharashtra and studying veterinary medicine, the RSS has created new dimensions of organizational success
 2009 main sangh pramukh bane bhagwat ke daur main aaj pratidin aath lakh se zyada swayamsevak desh main lagane vaali 55 hajaar se adhik shakhaon main jate hai
 More than two lakh service works (projects) are going on across the country
 bhagwat ke daur main sangh ne purvottar, dakshin ke un rajyon main khaasi majbootee darj kii he, jahaan pehle naganya upasthiti thi
 By the way, it is also said that in the 2014 elections, the victory was made easier by the standing of the Sangh Parivar by uniting behind Modi's face
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main or banpar jeet mili
 However, the Sangh considers it not to be a victory but a victory for the national aspirations of the people
 sangh ke kisi prachaarak se baat kariye to vah is baat par sidhaa aapatti jataate hai or kehete hai ki aap hamen bijepi se jodakar kyon dekhte hai
 On the occasion of Mohan Bhagwat's birthday, he talks about the relationship between the Sangh and the BJP during Modi's era
 bhagwat-modi ke daur main jabardast samanvayagujrat main aaj jo sangh kaa sanghathan he, uski neenv kabhi mohan raav bhagwat ke pita madhukar bhagwat ne daali thi
 He was the first Pracharak pracharak of Gujarat
 baad main shaadi kar unhone grihasth jivan main pravesh kiya tha
 Narendra Modi has attained Bhagwat in his youth
 sangh vichaarak dilip devdhareajtak
 If we look at the relationship, you can also say 'manas Son' of Madhukar Rao Bhagwat
 yah modi-shah ke daur kii bijepi or bhagwat kii aguwai vaale sangh ke bich sammanvay kaa hi nateeja he ki varsh 2014 or 2019 main lagaataar bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad se ab tak kisi tarah kii na vyaktigat or na sanghathanaatmak muddon par takaraav kii naubat nahin ai
 Whenever there was some confusion between the Sangh and the BJP on the economic and political issues, the Coordination Committee resolved to sit together
 bhagwat or modi ke daur main kisi tarah kii koi saarvajanik tikhi bayaanbaji bhi nahin hui, yahaan tak ki sanketon main bhi nishaanaa nahin saadhaa gaya
 Otherwise, during the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Sudarshan, the officials of the Sangh did not miss public statements
 swadeshi jaagran manch, sangh se jude kisaan or majdoor sangh to tab atal sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khole rahete the
 The example of coordination shown in the Pushkar meeting can be gauged from the maturity of the sangh-bjp relationship during the bhagwat-modi era in the recent coordinator meeting in Pushkar from September 7 to 9
 jab bijepi ko sabase zyada pareshaan karne vaale aarakshan ke masale par sangh ne saaf kah diya ki jab tak samaaj se asamanta khatm nahin hoti, tab tak aarakshan jari rahanaa chahie
 The BJP breathed a sigh of relief from this statement of the Sangh
 isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sangh raajnneetik mudde par bijepi kaa kitna khyaal karata he
 Dilip Deodhar calls this the success of coordination between the office bearers of the Sangh and the BJP
 bhagwat-modi main kai samanthaayensang pramukh mohan bhagwat 11 sitambar ko paidaa hue to pradhanmantri narendra modi 17 sitambar ko
 Not only the month, the birth date of both is also the same
 jab sangh kaa 2025 main shatabdi varsh hoga, tab bhagwat or modi donon 75 varsh ke ho jaaenge
 The personality of both Bhagwat and Modi has the virtue of co-ordinating over time
 sangh sutron kaa maananaa he ki bhagwat or modi hamaumr hai
 In such a situation, there is no such thing as senior-junior, due to which the relationship between BJP and Sangh was uneasy during the times of Atal and Sudarshan
 chintaa bhi donon kii saajha haisang or bijepi tathaa bhagwat or modi ke bich uchit samanvay banaakar kaam karne ke peeche astitv barkaraar rakhane kaa bhi maamla he
 Sangh ideologue Dilip Deodhar says that after Gandhi's assassination, Nehru banned the Sangh
 immergency main indira ne bandishen lagaayee or jab ayodhya kii ghatana hui to bhi tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ne bain laga diya tha
 At the same time, when the UPA government was in place, there was a preparation to tighten the Hindu terrorism term on the one hand and other leaders of the Sangh, including Indresh Kumar, on the other hand, there was an attempt to put Modi in the Gujarat and Home Minister Shah in the legal trouble
 aise main sangh, bijepi or modi kii sajhi chintaa bhavishya main astitv ko majbootee se banaae rakhane kii hui
 It was understood that the goals set in coordination can be met
 vistaar or agenda ko puraa karne ke liye satta kaa bhi rahanaa jaruri he
 This is the reason why the Sangh and BJP did not vow to repeat the same mistake as 2004
 mohan bhagwat ke daur main sangh yaa sahyogi sanghathanon ke padaadhikari bijepi kii nitiyon yaa netaaon kii vyaktigat aalochana se bachate hai
 Yes, there is a policy criticism in organizations' meetings
 sudarshan se vaajapeyi ke rishte asahaj rahotal bihari vaajapeyi ne 1995 main organizer main likhe ek lekh main sangh ko apni aatma bataaya tha
 He wrote, "the long association with the RSS is the direct reason that i like the Sangh
 main uski vichaardhaara pasand karata hum or sabase badi baat, logon ke prati or ek duusare ke prati aresas kaa drushtikon mujhe bhaataa he or yah bas aresas main miltaa he
 "however, after becoming the Prime Minister, there was a period when his relations with the Sangh were somewhat uncomfortable
 yah daur tha sangh main sar sanghachaalak bane kees sudarshan ke daur kaa
 At that time, the leaders of the Sangh and allied organizations did not miss out on personal attacks
 jabaki sangh main vyaktigat nahin balki nitigat aalochana kii parampara rahi
 In Vajpayee's time, there were several clashes with the Sangh's subsidiary organizations like Swadeshi Jagran Manch, VHP, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Kisan Union
 sangh se bijepi main aane vaale govindacharya kii ore se kathith taur par vaajapeyi ko mukhauta qaraar die jane se bhi rishte bigade the
 Even in an interview in 2005, the then RSS chief KS Sudarshan had made Atal Bihari Vajpayee indolent
 vahiin unhen raajnneetik sanyas lene kii bhi naseehat de di thi
 The issue of Govindacharya was also at the center of Vajpayee's displeasure with the Sangh
 jab atal bihari vaajapeyi ne naaraazgi main aakar kah diya tha ki bijpi main yaa to vah rahenge yaa phir main
 Eventually, Govindacharya had to leave the BJP on the pretext of study leave
 2004 main gaharaa gaya tha atal-sudarshan matbhedsang ke nagpur ke vichaarak dilip devdhar kehete hai ki 2004 main sangh parivaar hindu samaaj ko sangathit karne niklaa tha magar khud asangathit ho gaya tha
 As a result of the confrontation with Vajpayee, in 2004, the Sangh Parivar was not united in the election as it had been in the previous elections
 yah sudarshan or vajapapi ke daur main sangh or bijepi ke bich samanvay kii kami kaa nateeja tha
 Deodhar said, "although i would not say that the Sangh Parivar was not defeated, it made a difference in the 2004 general election
" bijepi or congress ke bich siton kaa antar zyada nahin rahaa
 Whatever seats BJP and NDA got, it was won by the good work of the Atal government
 haa agar sangh parivaar ekajute hua hota to nattejey jarur badal sakate the
 i would say that it was not the victory of the Congress but the defeat of the Sangh
 takaraav ke peeche junior-senior kaa bhi maamla!sangh vichaarak dilip devdhar kehete hai ki kees sudarshan apane vichaaron ko lekar bahut drudh rahete the
 This Atal Bihari Vajpayee knew
 yahi vajah rahaa ki bhale hi rajju bhaiya ne unhen 1998 main uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya tha, magar unhen sar sanghachaalak kaa daayitv der se varsh 2000 main mila
 There is a discussion in the Sangh Parivar behind the delay that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said at that time that if Sudarshan is formed now then there will be trouble in running the government
 aise main jab deree se daayitv mila to bhi sudarshan vaajapeyi ko lekar kuch naakaaratmak hue
 In fact, Sudarshan felt that Vajpayee wanted to interfere in the functioning of the Sangh even while in the BJP
 vahiin yah bhi mana jaataa he ki sangh main bhale hi sudarshan sar sanghachaalak ban gaye, magar atal bihari vaajapeyi unhen junior hi maanate the
 In such a situation, due to being a junior-senior, there was a conflict on some issues
 us vakt atal bihari vaajapeyi ne sangh parivaar se samanvay ke kaam se khud ko alag kar rakhaa tha
 This work used to be done by Advani
 jisase vaajapeyi or sangh ke tatkaaleen sar sanghachaalak ke bich rishte utane madhur nahin rahe, jitne kii hote hai

 pdp's chief spokesperson Naeem Akhtar said, "people voted against the National Conference in the election and with just 15 seats, she (NC) cannot decide on the formation of the government
" ' iske tatkaal baad neshnal conference ke mahasachiv ali mohammad sagar ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki uskaa prastaav bahari samarthan tak simit tha
 Taking a dig at the PDP, he said that he is ready to do everything possible to come to power

 The country's 72nd Independence Day will be celebrated loudly on August 15 tomorrow
 lekin teen dashak puraani parampara ke chalate madhyapradesh ke mandsaur shahar ke prasiddh pashupatinath mandir main aazaadee kaa salanaa parv 10 agast ko hi manaa liya gaya
 In fact, in this ancient temple on the banks of the river Shivana in Mandsaur, about 250 km from Indore, Swatantradayadivas are celebrated on the basis of Hindu calendar
 bhashaa ke mutabik, pashupatinath mandir ke purohiton or yajmaanon kii sanstha jyotish evam karmkand parishad ke adhyaksh umesh joshi ne bataaya ki 15 agast 1947 ko jab desh angreji raaj se aaazaad hua, tab hindu panchang ke mutabik shravan maas ke krishna paksh kii chaturdashi thi
 Hence, Independence Day is celebrated every year in the temple of Lord Shiva by worshiping on this date
 unhone bataaya- is baar yah tithi (shravan krishna chaturdashi) 10 agast ko padi
 Therefore, according to our tradition, we celebrated Independence Day at Pashupatinath Temple on this date
 joshi ne bataaya ki swatantraaa diwas par bhagwaan shiv kii vishesh puja kii gai
 During this period, the Ashtamukhi Shivalinga was anointed with the water of Durva (a type of grass used in worship) and prayed for the prosperity of the country
 unhone bataaya ki mandsaur ke pashupatinath mandir main shravan krishna chaturdashi ko swatantraaa diwas manaane kii parampara varsh 1987 se jari he

 Although he continued to travel a short distance

 His grandson Vishwajit Singh kept telling him that Dada himself should drive by himself to Pune

 aisa hi kuch ek america jode ke saath bhi ho gaya
 Actually, the couple wanted to memorialize their entrance at the wedding venue
 dulha-dulhan isamen safal bhi rahe, lekin unhone jo sochaa tha, hua uske thik ulat
 It is being told that the couple is from the US
 is jode ne tay kiya tha ki wo apni shaadi ke venue main behad alag andaaj main entry lenge
 The wedding venue was also great
 chaaron ore jhil se ghira ghaas kaa maidan tha, jahaan dulha-dulhan ko hawa main latakate hue utarana tha
 For this, he tied a wire
 sab kuch thik chal rahaa tha, lekin phir gadabad ho gai
 It happened that the bride had reached the meadow hanging from the wire with a bouquet in her hands when the groom came from behind and hit her
 iske baad dulhan to ghadi ke pendulum kii tarah hawa main lataki rah gai, jabaki dulha dhadaam se jameen par ja gira
 The video was shot in 2011, but has only been put on the internet for the past week

 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who lasted for nearly six and a half hours, said after the review meeting in Lucknow that the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 were going to be unsatisfying
 sindhiya ne kaha ki upachunaavon ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam par bhi charchaa karenge or apane dam par chunaav ladenge

 Our aim is to strengthen the organization
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar saunpa gaya tha
 The Congress performed poorly in western UP and the party could not win any seats
 khaas baat he ki congress sirf raibareli seat jeet pai
 Party chief Rahul Gandhi himself also lost the Amethi Lok Sabha seat to BJP candidate Smriti Irani
 vahiin samiksha baithak main congress netaaon kaa kahana tha ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan banane ke baad janata ne congress ko vikalp ke taur par dekhnaa chhod diya

 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle pichley kaaphi samay se aam aadmi party or congress ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar maathapai par viraam lag gaya he
 After a lot of political turmoil, an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress was finally formed in Delhi over the Lok Sabha Election
 sutron kii maane to dilli main loksabhaa kii saat siton main se teen-teen par donon partiyaan apane ummidavaar utaarengi
 At the same time, one seat will be given to Shatrughan Sinha or Yashwant Sinha
 yani dilli main na congress badi na aam aadmi party
 Both parties will contest on equal number of seats
 mana ja rahaa he ki shatrughna sinha yaa yashavanth sinha main se koi ek donon partiyon kii ore se saajha ummidavaar honge
 However, the decision in the name of Shatrughan Sinha will come after that stand of RJD, that if RJD will make Shatrughan Sinha candidate from Patna Sahib
 bataa den ki isse pehle hi aam aadmi party ne 6 siton par apane ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Actually, in the meantime, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has called a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the alliance with the leaders of Congress's Delhi unit
 dopaher 12 baje se inke ghar ek baithak honi thi
 It is believed that an official announcement on the alliance can be made only after this meeting
 sutron ke mutabik congress kaa kendriya netritv gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar tha, lekin party kii dilli unit iske paksh main nahin thi
 This is the reason why Congress President Rahul Gandhi had to come in the middle
 isse pehle khabar thi ki aam aadmi party ne congress ko gathbandhan ke liye do formula sujhaayaa he
 Now Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party is in the mood to deal seats
 yahi vajah he ki aam aadmi party ke pehle formula ke tahat AAP chaahati he ki dilli main aam aadmi party 6 siton par lade or congress mahaj ek par
 In this case, the Aam Aadmi Party will not contest elections again, where the Congress will be
 vahiin duusare formula ke tahat aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki agar dilli main congress ko zyada siten chahie to use punjab, haryana jaise rajyon main seat dekar isaki bharpai kerani hogi
 This claim of sources is also confirmed by this fact as the Aam Aadmi Party has so far announced the names of its candidates on 6 out of 7 Lok Sabha seats in Delhi
 unhone abhi tak ek seat par apana patta nahin kholaa he
 It is believed that the Aam Aadmi Party still believes that if an alliance is made with the Congress, then the seventh seat will be left for it
 idhar, mangalvaar ko dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath congress ke gathbandhan ko lekar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne baithak bulaai he
 Many Congress leaders will attend this meeting
 mana ja rahaa he ki sambhav he rahul gandhi aaj baithak ke baad dilli main aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan par faisla le lenge
 According to sources, the Congress high command wants an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, while the state unit of the Congress is not in favor of the alliance
 pichley saptaah mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalki aam aadmi party(aap) ne dilli kii 6 siton par apane ummidavaaron kaa elaan kiya tha
 AAP leader and Delhi convenor Gopal Rai has announced the names of his candidates for the 6 Lok Sabha seats so far for the Lok Sabha elections 2019, according to which their candidates are: mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke sandarbh main aresas ke khilaaf apni kathith tippanee ko lekar daayar manahani ke maamle main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi somvaar ko bhiwandi kii ek adaalat main pesh hue
 The next hearing on this issue will now be on 3 March
 'gandhiji ke hatyaron ke khilaaf ladaai'sunwaayee ke liye pahunche rahul gandhi ne court ke baahar kaha ki main aaj gandhiji ko yaad karata hum
 My fight is against the ideology that killed Gandhi, who removed Gandhi from the calendar
 gandhiji hameshaa bharat ke dil main rahenge
 They can kill Gandhiji, but cannot destroy him
 pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan bhiwandi main magistrate kii adaalat nerahul ko jamaantade di thi
 Rahul Gandhi also appeared in court at that time
 adaalat ne maamle ko 30 janvari tak ke liye sthagit kar diya tha
 Significantly, the local RSS official Rajesh Kunte has filed a defamation case regarding the statements of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul kaa yah bhaashan chah march, 2014 kaa he
 During this speech, Rahul had allegedly claimed that RSSK people killed Gandhi

 The Forum demands that the land on which the 39-storey building is being constructed should be set up from the private builders to establish the "ambedkar Hostel" in the name of Ambedkar ji so that this society will always remember you
 raashtrapati ko likhe patr main unhone bataaya he ki dilli vishvavidhyalay main har saal arakshit shrenee ke ummidavaaron kii sankhya main lagaataar vruddhi ho rahi he
 Every year, SC, ST, OBC students come from abroad to take up higher education (mphil, phd), but due to less seats in the hostel, they have to stay around campus with room to pay higher prices or as paying guests

 It is not possible to mention Rani Karnavati on Rakshabandhan
 karnavati aisi mahaan rajput rani thi, jinhone johar main jaan de di, par ghutane nahin teke
 In fact, the ruler of Chittor, Maharana Vikramaditya, was considered weak by Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and attacked the kingdom
 is musiibat se nipatane ke liye karnavati ne seth padmashah ke haathon humayun ko raakhi bheji thi
 What was given, along with Sandeshrakhi, Karnavati also sent a message
 unhone sahaayta kaa anurodh karte kaha tha ki main aapako bhai maanakar ye raakhi bhej rahi hum
 
 
 
 jab 72 saal pehle basaa-basaaya hiroshima hua shamshaan ghat main tabdilakyon der se pahunchi raakhidrasal, un dinon humayun kaa padaav gwalior main tha, isliye uske paas raakhi der se pahunchi thi
 By the time he reached Chittor with the army, Bahadur Shah's victory and queen Karnavati had been done
 # friendshipday: jaane dosti ke itihaas ke bare main jiskaa koi majahab nahin hotahumayun kii taiyaarirakhi milte hi humayun ne vahaan se agra or dilli sandesh bheja or fujen jutaney kaa aadesh diya
 But by the time he reached Chittor with the troops, it was late
 karnavati mahal kii sabhi striyon ke saath johar kar chuki thim
 If there was no light, then how could it have been able to withstand the traffic? Rani Karnavatimarch In 1534, the ruler of Gujarat, Bahadur Shah attacked Chittor at the behest of angry feudatories of Chittor
 rana sanga kii patni rajmata karnavati ko jab ye pataa chalaa to ve chintit ho gayi
 He knew that only Humayun could protect his kingdom
 isliye mewar kii laaj bachaane ke liye unhone mughal samraat humayun ko raakhi bheji or sahayata maangi
 Humayun accepted Rakhi
 raakhi milte hi usne dheron uphaar bhejein or aashwast kiya ki vah sahaayta ke liye aayega

 Bihar has a NDA government and there will be a government

 On the statement of BJP leaders, he said that it does not make any sense unless an official statement comes from the party

 The time has come to give the BJP a chance in return

 ' Since the beginning of the winter session in Parliament, the opposition has created uproar in both houses on the issue of demonetisation
 piem narendra modi dwaara 500-1000 ke noton ko band karne ke faisle or iske kaaran ho rahi dikkaton ke chalate vipaksh ne donon hi sadanon main virodh darj karaayaa he
 The same opposition has been demanding a discussion with the government on this issue in both houses
 sarkaar jahaan charchaa ke liye taiyaar hui vahaan sawaal yahi uthaa ki aakhir kis niyam ke tahat charchaa hogi
 The opposition has been demanding that the discussion be held under the rule in which voting takes place after the discussion
 vahiin sarkaar charchaa ke baad voting ke khilaaf thi
 Now Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan has made it clear that the notice under Rule 193 has been accepted to discuss demonetisation
 tippaniyan Discussion on "demonetisation of currency note for abolition of black money" has been placed on the agenda under Rule 193 in the Lok Sabha
 bijedy ke bhartruhari mehataab or tiares ke api jitendra reddy kaa notice loksabhaa spikar ne sweekaar kiya he
 Voting does not take place after discussion under this rule
 haalanki, aaj bhi is mudde par charchaa hone kii sambhaavna kam he kyonki anya vipakshi partiyaan voting vaale niyam ke saath charchaa par adi hai
 Let me tell you that for the last three weeks there has been a constant deadlock in the Parliament regarding demonetisation
 itnaa hi vipaksh sarkaar ke saath is mudde par donon hi sadan main charchaa kii maang karata rahaa he
 Where the government agreed to the discussion, the question arose as to what rules would be discussed
 vipaksh kii maang rahi ki charchaa us niyam ke tahat ho jisamen charchaa ke baad voting hoti he
 The government was against voting after discussion
 ab loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ne saaf kar diya he ki vimudrikaran par charchaa ke liye niyam 193 ke tahat notice sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The comments lok sabha main niyam 193 ke tahat "kaale dhan ke khatme ke liye karency note kaa vimudrikaran" par charchaa kaarysoochee main rakhaa gaya he
 The notice of Bhartrihari Mahtab of BJD and AP Jitendra Reddy of TRS has been accepted by the Lok Sabha Speaker
 is niyam ke tahat charchaa ke baad voting nahin hoti he
 However, the issue is less likely to be discussed today as other opposition parties are adamant on discussing it with the voting rule

 ab tak aapane taliban kii darindagi ke sirf kisse sune honge, aaj uski jubaan se sunenge aapbeetee jise taliban ne de rahi rakhi he maut ke ghat utaarne kii dhamkee
 His name is Vajma
 vaajama afghanistan ke ek tivi channel main ankar hai or taliban ke liye ye baat bardaasht se baahar he ki koi mahila tivi par dikhe
 Vajma is telling the story of the Taliban's havoc
 taliban ke farmaan kii choti si andekhi bhi aisi sajaa main tabdeel ho jaati he ki jiske bare main sunakar hi ruh kaanp jaae lekin afghanistan main ladakiyon ne vahshat ke us daur ko sirf dekha hi nahin balki use jhela bhi he
 Have seen how the Taliban throws acid on the beautiful face of a girl
 tejaab kii us dhar main ladki ke chehre ke saath-saath unki puri jindagi jhulaste dekha he
 The situation of the bestiality of the Taliban is that even if a girl goes out on the road in the burqa, the Taliban's gangsters throw acid on her face
 aise main bin burke ke ghar se baahar nikalne vaali ladakiyon ke hasr ke bare main to kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 It is a coincidence that Vajma is still alive to tell the story of the Taliban's excesses
 taliban ne vaajama ko bhi de rakhi he dhamkee ki use maut ke ghat utaar denge, uskaa galaa kaat denge
 What is Vajma's crime? Its only crime is that it is the anchor in a TV channel in Afghanistan, looks on TV, if the face of a woman walking on the road is seen, the Taliban throws acid, then the whole world sees Wajma's face
 taliban bhala ye kaise bardaasht kar saktaa he
 The fact is that Taliban rule means the death of women
 ladkiyaan skool nahin ja sakati, wo akele ghar se baahar nahin nikal sakati
 If it is necessary to get out, then they will have to stay in the screen from head to toe and hang it in the throat with a Taliban seal
 taliban ko mahilaon kaa mechap bilkul pasand nahin or agar kisi mahila ne nail polish yaa lipstick bhi laga liya, to use bich chauraahey par yaa to kode padenge yaa phir shuru ho jaaegi talibani aatankwaadiyon ke pattharon kii bauchhaar
 According to the Taliban, the biggest crime of women is love and if a woman in the occupied area of taliban committed the crime of love, then her punishment is certain and the Taliban do not need any proof for their law
 It is enough to punish charges
 taliban kaa farmaan he ki koi mahila sadak par bagaiyr kisi purush ko saath liye naa nikle or wo purush bhi us mahila kaa pati hona chahie
 For this, they will have to carry the marriage certificate along with it and if there is even a slight omission in the instructions on these orders, then the Taliban's acid is ready to ruin the beauty of Afghanistan

 Akal Takht, and also condemned the producers of the film for comparing whiskey or chicken to the Golden Temple
 unhone kaha ki film relies hone se pehle is dialog ko film main se hataa diya jaae
 According to Akal Takht chief Giani Gurbachan Singh, in addition to such comparisons of the Golden Temple, the string worn in the film has also been used incorrectly

 India's legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar has joined professional networking website linkedin on Thursday
 vah is site se linkdin infliansar ke taur par jude hai
 According to a statement, more than 500 people around the world have been associated with this website as influencers, Sachin is the first cricketer to be associated with this form
 soshal netwarking site linkedin se judane kii jaankaree khud sachin ne twit karke di
 He wrote that i am excited to come to linkedin India
 iske saath hi sachin ne 'maai second ining' tital se ek blog bhi likhaa he, jisamen unhone bataaya he ki unhen kab laga ki ab cricket chhod dena chahie
 Sachin wrote in the blog, 'delhi Champions League games were going on in October 2013
 meri subah kii shuruyaat kii gym workout ke saath hoti thi, jise main pichley 24 varshon se follow kar rahaa tha, lekin vah subah kuch badali hui si thi
 'sachin further wrote,' i felt that i was missing the strength i needed to get up and start the day
 us subah uthne main mujhe jor lagaana pad rahaa tha
 After this change we realized how important gym workouts are to my cricketing career
 jo kaam main pichley 24 saal se daily karata aa rahaa tha, lekin us subah meri kuch karne kii ichha nahin ho rahi thi, kyon?'sachin kii maane to ye wo sanket tha jo ahsaas kara rahaa tha ki ab mujhe ruk janaa chahie
 Because sports were the sweetest part of my life, but that day i felt that if i do not take some decision then i will not be able to do justice to the game
 linkdin main unka pehla post unke cricket ke baad vyavsaayee banane main hasil kii gai safalataa ke bare main bataati he
 Tendulkar has been associated through this platform with the aim of connecting with a large number of people and educating them to do better in their fields
 sachin ne kaha, 'main lagaataar sikh rahaa hum or haalia daur main maidan ke baahar maine kaaphi kuch siikhaa he
 This experience is different from my international cricket experience
 ek team kaa hissaa hona or lagaataar sikhte rahanaa mere aage badhane kaa kaaran he
 'sachin, who has attained the status of God in cricket, believes that on many occasions with this company, he can use his on-field experience to benefit the company
 unhone kaha, 'meraa lakshya apana anubhav linkdin jaise manch ke saath saajha karnaa he, taaki main badi taadaad main peshewar logon or udyamiyon tak pahunch sakuun or unhen ek alag soch de sakuun tathaa unke har din ke pradarshan ko behatar karne main unki madad kar sakuun

 maldive main supreme court ke aadesh ko darkinar karte hue vahaan ke raashtrapati abdulla yamin ne apatkaal lagu kar diya he
 In the midst of this political crisis, opposition camps of Maldives against the dictatorship of President Yameen and Supreme Court have requested India for help
 lekin maldive main china ke badhate prabhaav kii vajah se is baar bharat thode sanshay main he
 Maldives is a small country right, but really important for us
 aaie jaanate hai aisi das vajahen ki ham maldive ke halaat par mookadarshak kyon nahin rah sakate
 
 
 1
 maldive hind mahaasaagar main samrik rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn jagah par sthit he
 It is just 700 km from the Lakshadweep group of our country
 dur he
 The Maldives is adjacent to an important ship route that supplies energy to many countries such as China, Japan and India
 bharat kaa kareeb 97 fisadi antarrashtriya vyapaar hind mahaasaagar ke dwaara hi hota he
 Therefore, it can be understood how important it is for India to secure its routes
 2
 The Indian Ocean region has more than 40 countries and nearly 40 percent of the world's population
 china ne anti piresi abhiyaan ke naam par das saal pehle hind mahaasaagar main adan kii khadi tak apane nausainik jahaaj bhejne shuru kiye
 Due to this, the importance of Maldives grew steadily and now it has become the center of international geopolitics
 3
 India has now become an important force in South Asia
 hind mahaasaagar ilaake main suraksha vyavastha kaayam rakhane main bharat kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 For this India will have to cooperate with Maldives in the field of security and defense
 4
 China's growing economic cooperation with Maldives is a matter of concern for India
 maldive ke videshi karj main kareeb 70 fisadi hissaa china kaa ho gaya he
 The Maldives have had close ties with India for the first decades
 vahaan china kaa duutavas 2011 main hi khulaa he
 India opened its embassy there long before 1972
 isliye ab bharat ko china ke is dabadabe ko kam karne ke liye koi kadam uthaanaa hi hoga
 The current political crisis is an opportunity for this
 5
 India and Maldives have a decades-old religious, cultural, social and business relationship
 maldive ko 1965 main aazaadee milane ke baad manyata dene vaale pehle deshon main bharat shaamil he
 Therefore Maldives is important for us
 6
 There are around 25,000 Indians living in Maldives, which is the second largest foreign community
 maldive main har saal jane vaale paryatakon kaa kareeb 6 fisadi bharat kaa he
 Bollywood celebrities especially like to celebrate holidays there
 vahaan kai bollywood filmon kii shooting bhi hui he
 7
 maldive se bharat main bhi badi sankhya main vahaan ke naagarik shiksha, upachaar or kaarobaar ke liye aate hai
 The number of citizens of Maldives receiving long-term visas for higher education or treatment in India is increasing day by day
 8
 Large part of Maldives population wants India to help in this crisis
 inamen purv raashtrapati nashid kii party amdipi jaise vipakshi dal or unke samarthak bhi hai
 9
 maldive saarc kaa sadsy desh he
 India's role in SAARC is like that of a vanguard nation
 aisa hi chalata rahaa to maldive ke aage chalakar saarc se baahar nikal jane ke asaar hai
 Therefore, it is important for India to somehow make it into SAARC
 maldive saarc kaa ekmaatr aisa desh he jahaan piem modi kaa daura nahin hua he
 10
 maldive ek sunni musalmaan bahul desh he
 The current President Yameen has promoted religious fundamentalism in the country
 aisa mana jaataa he ki maldive se badi sankhya main noujvaan syria jaakar iageies main bhartee hue hai
 Weak Maldives can become a haven for religious extremists and radicals
 iske alaava vahaan taskari or nashili dawaaon kaa vyapaar bhi bad saktaa he
 These are all things that raise India's concern
 hamaare bagal main pehle se pakistan jaisaa dharmik kattarta vaala desh he, ham pados main ek or islamic kattar desh ko vahan nahin kar sakate, is par ankush lagaana hoga
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Thursday gave musician A
 aar rahamaan se hindu dharm main waapas aane kii apil karte hue kaha ki yah unki ghar vaapasi kaa samay he
 a fatwa was issued against Prophet Mohammad over a tune in a film
 vihip ke sanyukt mahasachiv surendra jain ne kaha ki hindu log prakhyat sangeetkaar kaa bahen failaakar swaagat karenge or aarope lagaaya ki unhone vanijyik kaarnon ko lekar islam sweekaar kiya tha
 He said, 'the fatwa against Rahman is very unfortunate and more unfortunate than this is the feeling of revenge present in it
 unhone ek film ke liye dhun taiyaar kii jo kisi dharm ke aadhaar par nahin he
 Surendra Jain told reporters, 'I will appeal to Rahman that he should return, he should return home
 hindu samaaj apane bete kaa intjaar kar rahaa he
 We will not only welcome them by spreading our arms but also ensure that they do not cause any harm, no matter how fatwa is issued
 ' ghar vaapasi ek vivaadaaspad kaarykram he jise kuch khaas hindu sanghathan chalaa rahe hai jiskaa lakshya musalamaanon or isaayiyon ko hindu dharm main waapas laana he
 Iranian director Majid Majidi has directed the film 'muhammad: Messenger of God'

 kya GST kaa asar ab dikhegaa shridevi kii film mom par? 1 july se lagu hue GST ke baad se hi jahaan ek taraf kai chijen mahangi hui hai vahiin kuch ke daam gire bhi hai
 But how beneficial the coming of GST has been for those watching the film and how much loss will have to be faced is a matter of understanding
 mumbai main tikat saste, dilli main koi asar nahibhi tak tikat ke daam main rajyon kaa antertenment tex bhi shaamil hota tha
 The same tax GST will be levied from now onwards
 is tarah kuch jagahon par tikat ke daam ghate hai to kai jagahon par koi asar nahin hoga
 How is Sridevi's film Mom, know in this review
 
 
 bataa den ki GST main film tikat ko 28 pratishat vaale tex slab main rakhaa gaya he
 That is, where earlier 40% entertainment tax had to be paid in Maharashtra, now 28% will have to be paid after GST
 is tarah mumbai main tikat rate ghat jaaenge
 Similarly, in Delhi almost earlier, there were ticket rates in this tax slab
 isliye GST ke aane ke baad dilli ke bollywood phans ko zyada fark nahin padegaa
 Whereas in the same neighborhood i
e
 noida-ghaziabad, the price of movie tickets will be less
 imotional drama he salmaan kii tubalite lekin ye kamiyaan bhi hai film main
 
 
 Will films be tax free? Taxes were removed from films to give good and social message to maximum audience
 yah puri tarah rajyon par nirbhar karata tha kyonki tex free kaa matlab antrterment tex kaa hatana hota tha or ise rajya sarkaar hi lagaati thi
 But now the GST will divide the state and central government

 But how much difference there will be in this price, it will have to wait a bit for now
 phullu main uthaa he sabase ahm mudda, jaane kya he maamla
 
 
 However, Yogesh says that the cost of theater owners may increase after GST due to increase in electricity rate and maintenance cost every year
 internet booking karaane par kya zyada dena hoga paisine dinon film tikat kii internet booking kaa jor he
 For this also, a separate tax has to be paid
 kya inke rate main bhi fark aayega? is bare main yogesh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar sabhi i-commers site ke tranjaction par kuch charge lagane kii planning main he
 However, nothing has been decided on this yet
 lihaaja internet booking main philhal tikat ke rate main zyada antar nahin hoga

 khaane-pine par badhegaa kharnagar aap movie outing ke dauraan nachos, cold drink, popcorn khub kharidte hai to aapako jeb thodi zyada halki kerani hogi
 After GST, their rates have increased by about 3 percent
 yani 300 kii cheez kharidne par aapako pehle jahaan 15 pratishat kaa tex dena hota tha, vah ab badhkar 18 percent ho gaya he
 Now, how much GST has an impact on the earnings of films, for this, along with MOM, you will also have to wait for the release of Jagga Jasoos
 kyonki ek tareeke se badi camershal film ranbir-katrina starer hi maani jaaegi

 ) The pictures of sabotage and violence in the name of culture and nationality in the country may have some truth
 samskruti ke paharedaar banane kaa daawa karanevaalon kaa cheharaa kuch or bhi ho saktaa he
 Aaj Tak has revealed the full truth of how terrible and embarrassing this can be
 jo log samaaj main maryaada ko bachaaye rakhane ke liye marane maarane kaa dam bharte hai unka asli dhandha kya he!mangalore ke pub se ladakiyon ko baahar nikaal kar unke saath badasluki karne kii tasviren aapke dimag main aaj bhi jinda hongi or ladakiyon ke saath aisa saluk karanevaale sanghathan shriram sena ke mukhiya pramod mutalik ko bhi aap nahin bhuule honge
 We are reminding you of Mutalik because we are going to introduce him to the same face of Mutalik
 dharm or samskruti kii raksha kii aad main mutalik or uske gurgon kaa asli cheharaa chipa he
 The team of Aajtak and Tehelka have captured the truth in their camera which will reveal that Mutalik who claims to be a watchman of nationality, tradition and culture is indeed a fraud
 sach ye he ki dharm kii aad main mutalik dhandha karata he
 The tehelka-aajtak team went out to meet Attavar when Pramod Muttalik, who was a business of sabotage by sending mercenary goons under the guise of protecting a particular religion, talked to his party's national vice-president Prasad Attavar
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baad jab ham attavar se mili or hamane uskaa sach janaa to pairon tale jameen khisak gayi or hamaara daawa he ki aap bhi hairat main pad jaayege
 Let us tell you one more truth of Shri Ram Sena chief Muthalik
 shriram sena ke mukhiya pramod mutalik kaa khasmkhas (yani daayan haath) prasad attavar he
 Before telling anything else about Atavar, let us tell you about Jitesh who claims that he can do anything with the voice of Pramod Muthalik, the head of Shri Ram Sena
 mangalore main kai dinon kii khaas chaanane ke baad ajtak tahalaka ke reportron se jab jithesh takaraayaa to wo hamen prasad attavar ke paas le gaya
 Yes, Prasad Attavar, whom we have mentioned to you earlier and have also told that this is the right hand of Pramod Mutalik
 is shaks ke bare main ajtak tahalaka ne jab chaanbin shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki attavar anderworld don ravi pujari ke liye kaarobaariyon se ugaahi karne ke liye jail ja chukaa he
 So we started fumbling its truth and then it put its real face in front of us
 attavar ne baatcheet main hamase kaha ki paisa do to karnataka hi kyon maharashtra pashchim bengal auki urisa main kisi bhi pradarshnee main todphod ho jaayegi
 At this we talked about the threat of the underworld with the exhibition from Attavar
 ajtak-tahalaka or attavar ke bich hui baatcheet ke kuch anshahtahalaka-ajtak: aisa ho saktaa he hamaari pradarshnee ke andar
 
 
 Ravi Pujari make a comment inside the media Attavar: Why? tehelka-aaj Tak: We will get more publicity from it
 Atavar: How will he? tehelka-aaj Tak: Atavar: How? tehelka-aaj Tak: From any perspective
 
 
 wo to sochna padegaa
 Suppose he will put a picture of his rival gang in the exhibition and he will threaten why we did this
 
 
 aisa hi kuch kar den to
 Attavar: Picture
 
 
 tasvirtahalaka-ajtak: wo jabardast ho jaeguttavar: wo chodo
 
 wo karegaa naa
 
 
 If he understands the meaning of Atavar's talk, then to bring the exhibition to the headlines, this person can also arrange for the threat of the underworld
 dange ke dhandhe kaa sach itnaa hi nahin he
 We wanted to see the full face of Attavar, so the matter continued and then in a short time he also blamed the truth of the setting with the police
 attavar ne kaha ki police ko vishwaas main lekar kaam karnaa hoga
 Police will have to 'set' by giving money
 isse hinsa ke baad kii giraftaareyon ko saamaanya giraftaar sabit karegi police
 Minor currents have to be imposed on boys who commit violence
 attavar ne kaha ki hinsa failaane vaale ladke mangalore ke baahar se honge
 Some things are clear like this from the discussion that Pramod Muthalik has a relationship with the underworld
 pramod muthalik ke gurgey phaayde ke liye anderworld kaa istemaal karte hai
 The rioting business is done by calling for culture
 panga, paisa lekar aasaani se ho jaye iske liye mutalik ke logon kii police ke saath setting bhi he or hinsa kii dukandaaree karne vaale ye log masuumon ko gumraah karte hai
 But during this time, the police arrest Prasad Attavar and our deal stops
 prasad attavar ko karnataka kii sabase surakshit jail bellari main rakhaa gaya
 But Prasad Attavar is so powerful and easily manages the police-administration
 prasad attavar anderworld ke ishaare par ugaahi ke aarope main pahunch gaya karnataka kii bellari jail par ajtak-tahalaka kii use benakaab karne kii muhim yaheen nahin rukii
 Our correspondents arrived in Bellary jail and there Atavavar's dreaded face was exposed to show how the national vice-president of Sriram Sena sells his faith for money
 jail main kaid prasad attavar ne aise khulaase kiye jinase hadakamp much jayega
 Despite being imprisoned, Attavar was fully guaranteed to get hired on the injury of Danke
 is guarantee kii baatcheet main attavar se jo baat hui uske kuch anshahtahalaka-ajtak: pachaas ladkaa hoga jo todphod

 That it

 tehelka-aaj Tak: Yes Attavar: This is a promise
 
 
 aapako puure neshnal media main
 
 
 tehelka-aaj Tak: Will get coverage
 
 
 ?attavar: haa kawarej mil jayega
 
 
 i do all the settings in the national media
 
 
 attavar ye kah rahaa he ki wo pub vaali todphod se badi tod karavaayegaa or media main kawarej bhi dilvaayegaa
 When we met Attavar in Mangalore Jail, he told us the economics of extortion on money this time
 anderworld se rishton kii puri kahani attavar ne kholkar rakh di
 It also revealed how the threat of underworld is also sold in the mercenary
 attavar: nahin
 
 nahin
 
 
 Mangalore yathalka-aaj Tak: Mysore Attavar: Mysore? In both the places i will set the tehelka-aaj Tak: How much will it cost? 
 
 idhar baat karnaa thik nahin he
 Attavar - In Mangalore
 
 
 tahalaka-ajtak: haa pradarshnee main 200 kaaryakarta hone chahibattavar-haantahalaka-ajtak: pub kii tarah hi tod-phod honi chahibattavar-wo main kya bolta hum

 main pehle bolaa tha aapse?shriram sena ke mukhiya pramod mutalik kaa khasmkhas prasad attavar ne todphod karne se lekar anderworld don tak kaa intjaam karne kii guarantee lee
 After this conversation, Attavar was shifted from Mangalore Jail to Bellary Jail
 lihaaja tahalaka-ajtak kii team attavar se milane bellari jail pahunchi
 Attavar's influence was visible here too
 andar ek alag kamare main hamaari mulaakaat attavar se karaayi gai
 Attavar: Regarding payment
 
 
 ?tahalaka-ajtak: haa kul kitna?attavar: abhi main kya bolta hum
 
 
 To be in one place? tehelka-aaj Tak: Two places, Mysore and Mangalore Attavar: How to talk about money
 kunthalka-aaj Tak: The police setting
 sanghathan kaa he
 The boy belongs to the people and belongs to you
 kitna kitna dena he
 How much to give sari setting aapako kerani he or ravi pujari kaa kya he

 You will see how Sriram Sena chief Pramod Muthalik agreed to spread violence on contract, then he also told that this work can be done in Bangalore too
 khud mutalik ne tahalaka-ajtak ke reporter ko bangalore main apane khaas aadmi vasant kumaar bhavani se milane ko kaha
 This Bhavani is the same person who was making headlines in the media after the attack on the pub in Mangalore as the spokesperson of Shriram Sena
 pradarshnee main bevajaah hinsa failaane ke liye pramod muthalik se baat pakki hone ke baad hamaari manzil tha bangalore shahar, jahaan pramod muthalik kaa sabase khurafati saathi or shriram sena kaa bangalore city pramukh vasant kumaar bhavani rahata he
 Vasant Kumar Bhavani is the same person who had become the spokesperson of Sri Ram Sena after the attack in Mangalore pub
 vailemtine de ke din jab kuch logon ne pramod muthalik ke chehre par kaalikh potee thi, tab shriram sena kii ore se javaabi hamalaa bolne vaala bhi bhavani hi tha
 Bhavani is a well-to-do man and Bhavani is Pramod Muthalik's most important companion
 bhavani ke bare main khud muthalik ne bataaya tha ki hinsa failaane jaise kaam main bhavani bahut maahir he
 Pramod Muthalik- What i am telling you
 
 Our president is there
 reporter- bangalore ke
 
 ?pramod muthalik- bangalore ke
 
 
 They are also very strong
 
 Introduced to you? Now you must know how important Muthalik and Shriram Bhavani is for the army
 bangalore ke jayanagar ilaake main ek chote se cafe main bhavani se mulaakaat hui
 During the conversation, Bhavani started explaining his entire plan in which area of bangalore it would be better to organize an exhibition and spread violence in the exhibition
 bhavani- ye rabindra kalakshetra maaloom he naa aapako
 
 
 ? Reporter- Yes
 
 Yes 
 Bhavani - There is an open stage behind it
 
 Reporter - how much crowd can come in it
 
 
 ?bhavani- do hazaar
 
 
 Reporter - 2000
 
 But he is communally sensitive, right? Bhavani - Communal wise is also sensitive
 
 If spoken, the market is very close from there
 
 
 reporter- city market?bhavani- city market
 
 
 Reporter - Yes, there is a Muslim area there
 
 Bhavani - That's why this place is very good for you
 
 There is a very good scope from Shivaji Nagar, because there is also a lot of Muslim population next to it
 
 
 bhavani acchhee tarah jaanata he ki kis ilaake main hinsa failaana aasaan he
 There was talk of spreading violence in the name of art exhibition and this vicious name Vasant Kumar was now explaining to us that the area where he wants to spread violence, what is the benefit of that place
 
 ? Reporter- Yes, it is in the city market
 
 But the commercial area falls more there
 
 
 bhavani- aapkaa jo thinking he naa, uske liye suut ho jaataa he udhar
 
 
 Reporter - suits our profile
 
 ? Bhavani - Suits him
 
 There is more suit than Shivajinagar
 
 Shivaji Nagar became a remote area, it is more floating
 
 
 reporter- shivaji nagar kiya to vahaan par ye lagegaa
 
 
 There is not an educated class, so why doing it there? 
 
 city market kiya to
 
 bhavani- aapako idia ke liye or is concept ke liye ye match ho rahaa he
 
 kyonki ilitaret aake aapkaa gailaree to dekhne vaala nahin he
 
 dekhegaa to ye aapkaa
 
 apper class
 
 middle class
 
 
 Reporter- Elite Class
 
 Bhavani knows that where there will be a crowd of upper class people, there will be more headlines than sabotage
 bhavani jis jagah par hinsa failaane kii baat kar rahaa tha, uskaa ek or phayda tha
 Bhavani knew that even after spreading violence with complete preparation at such a place, no one would doubt that everything was pre-decided
 bhavani- apper class hi zyaada dekhegaa
 
 to apper class
 
 
 If you keep it in Shivaji Nagar then who will come
 
 It will be pre-planned for everyone
 
 
 reporter- hammam
 
 bhavani- agar shivaji nagar kiya to
 
 
 Yes, if you think from one direction, it is right, but it will not get much air
 
 
 reporter- haa
 
 logon ko kahin lag saktaa he
 
 
 Somewhere there is an under table alliance
 
 Bhawani - may look
 
 
 vasant kumaar bhavani bangalore main pradarshnee ke dauraan hinsa failaane ke liye raji tha
 After considering each aspect, he had prepared the entire plan and after seeing his diary, he also described the best day to spread violence in the exhibition
 wo jaanata tha ki weekend main pradarshnee dekhne ke liye zyaada log jutenge
 
 isliye usne weekend kaa din chunaa hinsa failaane ke liye
 Bhavani- Weekend is good for riots
 weekend main zyaada bheed hogi or bada seen creat hoga
 We will work out the setting with the police
 lekin pehle ham paison kii baat tay kar len
 You can understand from the talk of Basant Kumar Bhavani that instigating a riot in Bangalore is a minor matter for him
 wo guarantee de rahaa tha kaam kii
 Provided that he gets the desired price
 vasant kumaar bhavani
 The Bangalore City chief of Shri Ram Sena is more vicious than ours-you-think
 usne naa sirf paise lekar hinsa failaane ke liye jagah sujhai, balki ye bhi bataaya ki kise chif guest banane se hinsa failaane kaa kaam aasaan hoga or jab baat paison kii ai, to bhavani ne ek-ek kaam kaa rate list pesh kar diya
 You have already heard why Vasant Kumar Bhavani, the right-hand man of Pramod Muthalik in Bangalore, chose the city market place to spread violence
 ye uske plan kaa pehla hissaa tha
 It was also the idea of this vicious thing that if a Muslim leader is made the Chief Guest in the exhibition, the work of Shri Ram army will be more comfortable
 chif guest banane laayak netaaon kaa naam bhi bhavani ne hi sujhaayaa
 Bhavani - Call Mumtaz Ali only
 
 
 reporter- kisko
 
 ?bhavani- mumtaj ali ko
 
 reporter- ye koun he
 
 
 Bhavani is a minister of the Waqf Board, is it not? 
 
 abhi
 
 
 Reporter- from Karnataka
 
 Bhavani - Yes
 
 
 reporter- aa jayega wo to
 
 kitna age hoga mumtaj ali kaa
 
 ?bhavani- fifty ke upar he
 
 
 After suggesting the name of the chief guest, Bhavani began to tell what preparations had to be made before the violence spread
 usne bataaya ki maukey par ambulance bhi chahie
 Because how much bloodshed would happen in the pre-determined violence, even Bhavani does not know
 bhavani- main iskaa esurance nahin de saktaa
 
 
 How much will be your damage 
 Damage will happen
 
 But how much it will not guarantee
 
 
 kyonki hamaare ladke bahut pherosius (ugr) ladke hai
 
 
 They do not look back and forth
 
 Reporter- Once done
 
 
 bhavani- kiya
 
 
 i can't even avoid them, because i will get angry
 
 
 jab netaa hi pherosius he to unke foloar bhi pherosius honge
 
 
 i want to tell you this much
 
 
 damege to hoga lekin kitna hoga
 
 ye bol nahin saktaa hum
 
 bhavani kii baton se saaf he ki uske giroh main bhaade par maar-peet karne
 
 
 There is a whole army of sabotage
 wo hamen bataa rahaa tha ki ek baar uske ladke bekaabu ho gaye, to unhen control karnaa mushkil hoga
 That is why Bhavani was telling that the ambulance will have to be kept ready
 reporter- public beating ho sakati he
 
 
 Bhavani - may be
 
 
 udhar aake jo bhi aake unako
 
 
 Because our boys also do all this
 
 
 porter- bheed vagairah ai to phir control nahin hota
 
 bhavani- control nahin hota he
 
 reporter- ambulance taiyaar rakhana padegaa
 
 ?bhavani- bilkul
 
 
 It can also happen
 
 They are my people again
 
 When you take something
 
 
 to phir unako samajhaana padataa he
 
 
 Have to speak
 
 
 cese zyaada ho jayega
 
 pehle se zyaada cese he
 
 
 Control it 
 
 sirf jo ye disple he usko thodaa
 
 
 these
 
 
 reporter- damege karo
 
 
 Bhavani - Damage it
 
 
 logon ko tach mat karo
 
 
 Reporter- He doesn't listen but
 
 Bhavani - i will explain this much but
 
 
 bol nahin sakate naa
 
 ek-aadh to rahata he jo leki mila usko tod do, phod do
 
 aise siraphire log hai
 
 pradarshnee ke dauraan hinsa failaane kaa ek-ek plan bataane ke baad bhavani mudde kii baat par aayaa
 That is, how much will be the price to spread the riot? Reporter- He told me two lines
 
 Different for the organization
 
 Different for the worker
 
 
 to maine sanghathan ke liye 5 lakh kaa
 
 to bole dekhenge
 
 kaaryakartaaon ke level par ye ho jayega ki cese vagairah pad gaya to thik he
 
 kaaryakartaaon ke liye 50 hazaar par
 
 
 He will get something
 
 Something will be used in his case
 
 
 das ladkaa aa gaya to 5 lakh
 
 unhone mujhe bolaa yun
 
 sanghathan kaa aap kya karte ho wo muthalik ji ke saath he or ladkaa
 
 
 I'll give you that myself
 
 The setting of the police
 
 i will do it too
 
 That also has to be done
 
 
 bhavani- police kaa setting bhi karnaa padegaa
 
 
 Without him it will not be there
 
 
 bhavani kii ye baat behad hairaan karne vaali he
 He is taking the contract to spread violence and is also talking about setting up with the police before spreading the violence
 iske liye wo saude main alag se rakam tay karne main juta rahaa
 Reporter - No
 
 
 hoga
 
 to vahaan par 3 fez main ja rahaa he
 
 
 3 Dimensional
 
 
 sanghathan kaa alag
 
 kaaryakartaaon kaa alag or police kaa alag
 
 
 Bhavani - Separate police
 
 
 bhavani hinsa failaane ke saude main bhi puri saavdhaanee barat rahaa tha
 He first asked us about our budget in exchange of violence in Bangalore and then asked how much money Sriram Sena Vice President Prasad Atavar had agreed to do in Mangalore
 
 
 ? bhavani kii baton se ye saaf ishaara mil rahaa tha ki dange ke dhandhe main uske or atavar ke bich hode chal rahi he ki sanghathan ke liye koun, kitna paisa kama saktaa he
 Hooliganism and riots were caught in the intelligence camera
 sari baaten ho chuki thim
 It had been decided that how and when the destruction would be done
 paison kii baatcheet bhi muthalik ke ek aadmi se ho chuki thi
 Now Muthalik had yet to be stamped
 hamaari team phir pahunchi muthalik ke paas
 This time Muthalik's tongue was slightly changed
 pataa nahin kya baat thi ki pichhali mulaakaat main jo seenaa chaudaa kar apane gundon or gundgardee kii baat kar rahe the, wo is baar aatma kii aawaaj sun rahe the
 However, Muthalik had these things just to preserve his image
 agar unki chhavi par daag naa lage, to wo kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai
 We are saying this also because Muthalik returned to his old things in a short time
 wo taiyaar the ki unke log fasaad karenge
 Ready to take money, their goons will reach the designated place to sabotage
 baat saaf he or wo ye ki muthalik khud sidhe-sidhe paison kaa len-dein nahin karte
 But they know where and how the money is reaching them
 ajtak-tahalaka ke khulaase main ye baat saaf he ki parampara or samskruti ke naam par gundgardee kii jo dukaan pramod muthalik ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar kholi he, wo khub chal rahi he
 Tafsil tells you how the company of the business of rioting works at the behest of Muthalik
 kaise paise ke liye dharm kii dukandaaree chalaata he shriramsena kaa mukhiya pramod muthalik
 How Muthalik's company riots in the name of Hindu culture
 shriram sena kaa mukhiya pramod mutalik dange kii supaari letaa he
 He does not talk about money and gives the betel nut to his Karinde Prasad Attavar
 prasad attavar paise ke dam par hinsa kar surkhiyaan batorne vaale se puri deal karata he
 He talks about the money and then gives the contract to his partner Basant Kumar Bhavani
 basant puri ranneeti banaata he ki kitne paise par kitne log kis tarah se kis mudde par virodh kii hinsa karenge or kin dhaaraon par police giraftaar karegi or kin dhaaraon par mukadmaa kaayam hoga
 In which city will the man arrive from which city to riot, and then when the details of the money rupees and the whole strategy is ready, then Pramod Mutalik-finalizes the deal
 phir basant or attavar apane karinde pujari,jithesh or kumaar ko saunp dete hai dange ke dhandhe kii deal
 These three arrange rioters
 unhen bataate hai ki kis cheez ko todna he or kise chhodana he
 They decide who is to be beaten and whose face is soaked, and they decide the end to which the violence is to take place
 is tarah se mutalik kii company kaam karti he
 The world thinks that the extremist Hinduist organizations are fighting the fight for the protection of culture, but the reality is that they are simply using people to earn money and some people are making headlines by contracting violence on the basis of money

 In fact, he became the inspiration for the message
 akhilesh pandeyb uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri harish ravat par kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) kaa shikanja kasata najar aa rahaa he
 In fact, on 30 September, the Uttarakhand High Court allowed the CBI to file an FIR against Rawat in the 2016 Sting case of alleged buying and selling of mlas
 isse pehle teen sitambar ko sibiai ne hycourt ko yah jaankaree di thi ki usne is cese kii jaanch puri kar lee he or vah jald hi is maamle main exiar darj karnaa chaahati he
 In that sting video, Rawat was allegedly seen bargaining to gain the support of the rebel mlas to continue in power
 isi video ko aadhaar banaakar 31 march, 2016 ko rajyapal kii sanstuti ke baad ravat ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch shuru hui thi
 At the same time, after the end of President's rule and the government was reinstated, the then Harish Rawat government had on May 15, 2016 recommended that the case be investigated by SIT instead of CBI
 par yah maamla sibiai ke paas hi rahaa
 Rawat then moved to the High Court to escape arrest and the court ordered the CBI to take permission from the court before taking any action
 duusari ore, congress se baagi harak singh ravat ne bhi hycourt main yachika daayar kar rajya sarkaar ke 15 may, 2016 ke aadesh ko chunauti di thi
 Now the High Court is hearing both the petitions simultaneously
 isamen rajyapal kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish ko di gai chunauti bhi shaamil he
 In its recent order, the court said that CBI is free to register an FIR and initiate an inquiry into the matter, but Rawat cannot be arrested until his final order and only after his order, CBI should take further action
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 1 november ko hogi
 According to the Supreme Court lawyer and former Union Minister Kapil Sibal, appearing for Rawat, "the High Court has said that the CBI can file an FIR if desired, but the decision will be based on if the Governor's order of March 31, 2016 CBI cannot do any prosecution if it goes wrong
 ''is bich, uttarakhand congress ke vibhinn dhade ravat ke saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 To show solidarity with Rawat, state Congress president Pritam Singh, leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh, former state president Kishore Upadhyay and former cabinet minister Tilak Raj Behad reached Nainital and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the central government of conspiring against Rawat
 Planted
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar sibiai kaa galat istemaal kar sajishan ravat ko shikanje main lene kii koshish kar rahi he
 Pritam Singh expressed displeasure, "the BJP government at the Center had conspired to topple the previous Congress government
" bhaajapa ne congress ke vidhayakon ko todaa
 But instead of taking action against those who topple the government by giving temptation, efforts are being made to act on Rawat on the pretext of sting

 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main pehali baar maidan main utari is nai party ne 28 siten jiti thim
 i met the poet Gulzar a few years ago, when his daughter Meghna and my daughter Ranjitha made a film together - Just Married
 bahut sidhi-saadi or gahari film thi
 i hoped that would go well, but our box office is not always very generous towards such straightforward films, especially if the film also has a little intelligence and understanding
 just marid aisi hi film thi
 However, Gulzar says that he had known me since the '70s, when he used to visit Kolkata often
 vahaan sadak kinare chamchamati choti-choti kitabon kii dukaanon main tafarih karte hue kai baar meri kavitaaon kii kitaaben kharid lete or unhen apni librari kaa hissaa bana lete
 But little do they know that it was about the same time when i used to watch the films that he wrote and directed with great wonder and surprise, sitting in the dark, dark neem of the well-known giant cinema hall of Kolkata
 Were
 unki bhashaa, unki kalpana or yahaan tak ki unke maun main bhi kuch to baat thi
 The way there was a silence in his films, i was filled with astonishment at the man's understanding and talent for words and images
 agar aap mujhase kamedi kii baat karen to jo pehali film mere jehan main aati he, vah he angoor
 If you talk about the mystery of male-female relationship, then the effort of the film flashes in the mind
 raajnneeti? aandhi film apane vakt kii raajnneeti ko kai roopon or arthon main paribhaashit karti he
 One such film is Matches
 film achaanak maheenon tak akhabaaron kii surkhiyon main chhaae rahe nanaavati cese se prerit thi
 The film veneer was the story of an extramarital affair, which was censored by the censors
 mausam ek pita or uski veshya beti ke bich sambandhon kii khoj karti he
 And long before Arvind Kejriwal came on the scene, the film Hootootu had lathi on the fast growing corruption in India
 40 baras se zyada guzar chuke hai
 Gulzar did not make any film for many years
 darasal unhone 21veen sadi ke shuruaati 14 saal main koi film nahin banaai
 (his last film Hootootu was made in 1999
 ) lekin ve takreeban har saal vah kisi-na-kisi film ke liye likhe gaye apane geet ke liye sarvshereshth geetkaar kaa aword uda hi le jate hai
 Since Gulzar used to make films, cinema has changed a lot since then
 vaise hi dhamal machaane vaale hit geeton kii duniya bhi kaaphi badal chuki he
 But even after passing from year to year, the magic of Gulzar's words remains intact
 unke geet us peedi kaa bhi dil jeet rahe hai, jise shaayad yah bhi pataa na ho ki gulzaar ne apane samay kii kuch bahut yaadgaar filmein banaai hai or hindi cinema kii teen mahaan shakhsiyaton bimal roy or rishikesh mukherjee main unka bhi naam shumaar kiya jaataa he
 His poems have also become more sharp and deep with age
 kavitaaon ke bimb, saadagi or gaharaai aapke dilo-dimag par chaa jate hai
 i have seen him reading in front of an audience
 shrotaaon ke saath ve turant ek jaadui rishta kaayam kar lete hai
 They are not trying to impress anyone
 ve sirf ye bataa rahe hai ki unhone kya dekha, chuaa, mahasoos kiya
 Surprisingly, his words go deep in you and you see those things in the same way
 mumkin he, unhen aapane pehle bhi dekha ho, lekin kabhi yah nahin sochaa hoga ki ve aapaki jindagi main aisa anokhaa jaadu bhi bhar sakati thim
 i never had this much talent
 isliye maine purnakalik patrkaar banane ke dauraan kavitaayen likhnaa chhod diya
 As a poet and journalist, i knew that struggle with words was not possible for me
 ek patrkaar jise likhane ke paise milte hai or jo kuch ghanton main hajaaron shabdon kaa mattha bana dete hai
 After almost two decades i returned to poetry and i am not surprised that i found Gulzar present at the launch of every new book
 gulzaar ko apane shabdon kii akhandta or eemaandaaree kaayam rakhane ke liye koi sangharsh nahin karnaa padaa
 Words come to them on their own
 kavita, kahani, gadhy, geet or yahaan tak ki film lekhan bhi
 All have been integrated into their creative universe
 dadasaheb phalke puraskaar se sammanit 46 logon main se gulzaar nishchit hi mere sabase priy logon main se ek hai
 He earned his living by words, but did not forget to choose the right words
 unke liye shabd sirf prem kii gunagunaahat nahin, balki yudgh kaa hathiyaar bhi hai or shanti kii mashaal bhi
 He did what he was best at
 apane shabdon ke jariye hamaare jivan ko chuaa, hamen vah dikhaaya, jo shaayad ham nahin dekh pate, sannaate kii gunj sunai, jaadu kii anubhuti karai or hamaare jivan ko samrudgh kiya
 When it comes to words, there is definitely no one like Gulzar
 lekhak film nirmaataa hai

 Prior to the visit of US President Barack Obama to India, the popularity of American leadership in the country has gone down significantly compared to the year 2008
 bharat main log obama prashasan kii peshewar vija fees main vruddhi kiye jane tathaa outsorcing par uski nitiyon ko lekar khaasaa naaraaz hai
 According to the latest data released yesterday by Gallup Poll, the popularity graph of the US President has fallen from 31 per cent in 2008 to 18 per cent in 2010
 iske vipareet 7
 With the approval of the Carrie Lugar Burman Bill of $ 5 billion in aid and help in large-scale flood relief work, the popularity of the American leadership in Pakistan has increased where it has increased from ten percent in 2008 to 18 in 2010
 Has reached percent
 outsorcing ke khilaaf apane abhiyaan ko tej karte hue obama ne haal hi main kaha tha ki unka prashasan keval unheen companiyon ko kar main laabh pradaan karegaa jo desh main rojgaar ke avasar paidaa karengi
 This is a move that could affect Indian IT companies on a large scale
 obama kii november main hone vaali bharat yatra se purv obama prashasan ek vivaadaaspad vidheyak laayaa he jisamen ech 1 bi or el 1 vija fees main vruddhi kii gayi he
 The move is believed to be a blow to India's IT industry of over $ 50 billion
 ise sanyog hi kaha ja saktaa he ki jin 18 asian deshon main gaoup survey karaayaa gaya unamem se bharat or pakistan main america netritv kii sarvaadhik kam lokapriyata dar darj kii gayi he
 The number of people who dislike Obama in Pakistan is 68 percent and 72 percent in India
 jin anya deshon main america netritv kii lokapriyata dar kam darj kii gayi he unamem vietnam, srilanka, nepal or indonesia bhi shaamil hai jahaan survey ke daayre main aane vaale logon main se aadhe logon ne apni koi raay jaahir nahin kii lekin jinhone ne bhi apni raay jataayi unamem se obama prashasan ko pasand karne waalon kii sankhya bhi acchhee khaasi thi
 Since 2008, the number of people expressing uncertainty about the American leadership in India, Vietnam, Nepal and Indonesia has also increased significantly
 gaoup ne kaha he ki pakistan or afghanistan hi surveykshan ke daayre main aane vaale keval aise desh hai jahaan kramash: 68 or 54 fisadi ne america netritv ko naapsand kiya he
 The popularity of American leadership in these countries has been decreasing in the last several years
 saal bhar pahate tak america or uttar korea duniya bhar ko jang kaa dar dikhaa kar daraate rahe
 Many times it seemed as if nuclear war would really start
 magar phir trump or kim jone un donon shant ho gaye
 Kim Joon Un is still cool
 magar america ek baar phir ashaant ho uthaa he
 But this time its target is Iran, not North Korea
 america drone ko maar giraane ke iran ke kadam ke baad se america lagaataar iran par chadhaai karne kaa mauka dhund rahaa he
 On the other hand, the attitude of Iran is also tough
 lihaaza khatra is baat kaa he ki kahin sachmuch jang shuru naa ho jaae
 20 June 2019 Kumobarak, Iran Unmanned Global Hawk MQ-4C traton surveillance drone valued at US $ 130 million, or about 696 million rupees, was trying to sneak into Iranian airspace
 or tabhi bina vakt ganvaae irani revolutionari guard ne radar gided missile se use maar giraaya
 America woke up as its most modern and powerful drone was shot down
 lekin isse pehle ki america iran ke khilaaf koi dhamkee detaa
 a statement from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was released
 unki taraf se kaha gaya ki "america hamen halake main naa le ham apni simaaon kii hifaazat karnaa jaanate hai
 "iran's retort to America: America has the courage to speak against this posture in Russia, after Russia and China, but it will also kill this advance drone without radar Guided missile cannot be dropped
 ye ummid use nahin thi
 The US therefore adopted the first policy of war to respond to Iran, stating that its drone was in international airspace and not Iranian airspace
 magar iran ne bina der kiye uski is niti ko ek video jari kar fail kar diya
 In which the American drone in Iranian radar is seen entering its air range
 20 june 2019 shaam 7
 At 45, Washington DC, americaamerican drone MQ-4C a tweet from President Trump's Twitter account several hours after the trough was dropped
 ''iran ne ek bahut badi galati kar di he
 The world understood with Trump's warning and stern tone that now America is going to take some big action against Iran
 jang kii shuruuaat kisi bhi vakt ho sakati he
 But instead of trying to avert war
 iran kii taraf se trump ke twit kaa jawaab kuch is tarah aayaa
 Come, we are ready for war
 america raashtrapati donald trump ke is twit ke baad iran par hamale kii taiyaariyon shuru ho gayi
 Orders for an attack were also ordered from the US President's office
 20 june 2019 der raat, oman kii khadiamerica ne apane vimaanon ko iran or oman kii khadi se hokar guzarane par roak laga di
 And deployed their warships, fighter aircraft and warships to attack Iran in the Gulf of Oman
 kisi bhi vakt hamalaa shuru ho saktaa tha
 But then a message came from Washington
 hamale kii yojana radd kar di gai he
 Because his advisors explained to President Trump that this attack on Iran could be fatal at this time
 kyonki 2015 main iran ke jis parmaanu samjhaute ke ulanghan ko aadhaar banaakar america use katghare main khadaa karne or us par hamalaa karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 China, France, Germany, Russia, European Union and Britain were not in the court of America itself
 kyonki in deshon kaa maananaa he ki iran ne samjhaute kii har shart kaa paalan kiya he
 In such a situation, all countries except Saudi Arabia and Israel are seen standing with Iran on this issue
 lihaaza kabhi oman kii khadi main khadey tel tankeron par hamale, to kabhi america drone maar giraae jane kaa bahaanaa lekar trump kisi bhi surat main iran par hamalaa karnaa chaahate hai
 In fact, the US is under pressure from countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel to attack Iran on the one hand because they see Iran's increasing dominance in Arab countries as a threat to themselves
 vahiin duusari taraf trump ke liye bhi ye jang zaruri he kyonki agle saal kii shuruuaat main vahaan aam chunaav hai or trump in chunaavon main rashtrawaad ke mudde par phir se white house par apana kabza chaahate hai
 And perhaps that's why he is blaming former President Barack Obama for this agreement and calling it extremely dangerous for America
 haalanki is bich roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin is masale par america ke saamne dhaal banakar khadey ho gaye hai

 The comments gujarat sarkaar hardik kii maang ko lekar kitni gambhir he, yah abhi tak pataa nahin chalaa paaya he, lekin hardik ke khilaaf kai sanghathanon ne apni awaz uthaanaa shuru kar diya he
 The OBC community of Gujarat is going to start its maha rath yatra on 1 September
 ranvir desai kii aguwai main 'aarakshan suraksha sanghathan rathyatra' puure gujarat main niklegi
 Ranvir Desai said that this rath yatra will reach 248 tehsils, 162 municipalities, 8 general municipalities of Gujarat
 yah yatra 26 janvari 2016 tak chalegi
 Ranveer Desai says that if the government wants to do something for the Patel community, then do it, but do not include this community in the 27 percent reservation for obcs
 agar sarkaar 27 pratishat se zyada aarakshan detii he to is par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Ranveer Desai has also raised the question why are these people now demanding reservation when Sardar Patel himself was against reservation
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki aarthik maapdand ko lekar sarkaar kuch karnaa chaahati he to sabhi jatiyon ke liye kare
 On the other hand, Thakur army has also waged its war against Hardik
 thakur sena ke kanvener alpesh thakur 23 agast se ahmedabad main dharne par baithne vaale hai
 Their objective is to empower the OBC community
 unhen lagata he ki patel samudaay ke obisi main aane par is varg main purv se maujuud jatiyon ko nuksaan hoga
 He considers Hardik Patel's demand wrong
 gujarat main lagbhag 54 pratishat obisi hai or unamem 36 pratishat thakur samudaay ke hai
 Alpesh also informed that there has not been much development of obcs in this year
 agar 12 pratishat patel obisi main aa jaaenge to muqaabala or bad jayega
 It is not known who will win and who will lose in this battle, but such a battle will definitely bring a stir in the politics of Gujarat
 kuch hi dinon main 22 saal ke yah ladke ne gujarat ke patel samudaay main apni alag pahchaan banaai he
 Hardik Patel has been working for his community for the last four years
 hardik mahilaon kii suraksha or kisaanon kii maang ko lekar awaz uthaa rahe hai
