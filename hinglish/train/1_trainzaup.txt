 ) cricket ke maujuuda jamaane main albert trot kaa naam bhale hi anjaanaa-sa lagata ho, lekin is cricketer ke naam bade chaunkaane vaale record hai
 Surprisingly, this all-rounder, born in Australia, shot himself at the age of 41 on this day (july 30) in 1914
 lekin aaj bhi trot ke kirtiman romanchit karte hai
 The cricketer Trott had a Test career of only five Tests, playing Tests from both Australia and England
 unhone australia or england donon kii tiimon kii taraf se test match khele (3 test australia or 2 test england kii ore se)
 Trott made his debut against England in January 1895 in Adelaide
 debyue kii ek pari main 8 wicket lene vaale pehle bolertrot apane pehle hi test kii pari main 8 wicket lene vaale pehle gendbaaj ban gaye
 Since then, 8 bowlers have taken 8-8 wickets in the innings of the debut test
 lekin sabase kam ran dekar 8 wicket lene kaa record aaj bhi daahine haath ke slo bowler trot ke naam he
 See this list - TOP-3: 1 of the most economical 8 wickets in a debut test
 albert trot (australia) : 27 over, 10 madan, 43 ran, 8 wicket, 18952
 Bob Messi (australia): 27
 2 over, 9 madan, 53 ran, 8 wicket, 19723
 Narendra Hirwani (india): 18
 3 over, 3 madan, 61 ran, 8 wicket, 1988
 
 
 So, leaving Australia and moving to England, Albert Trott scored 102 in three Tests for Australia
 50 kii ausat se ran banaae
 Nevertheless, Australian selectors did not listen to him and did not select him for the 1896 tour
 iske baavjood trot ne himmat nahin haari or vah khud ke kharch par england chale gaye
 Where he got a chance to play for Middlesex in county cricket
 isi ke baad 1898 main trot ne england kii ore se da
 Played 2 Tests in Africa
 lords main sabase bada chakka lagane vaale ekmaatr cricketer1899 main jab australia kii team england daure par ai to trot ne jabardast dhamaakaa kiya
 In fact, in the match played between MCC and Australia at Lord's on 31 July, Trott hit a six off Australia's Monty Noble that made history
 trot lords ke pavalian ke upar se chakka jadne vaale ekmaatr khilaadi hai
 Trott played 375 first-class matches during the 1892–1910 feat of two hat-tricks in an innings of first-class cricket
 victoria or middlesex unki timen raheen
 He 21
 09 kii ausat se 1674 wicket liye
 Middlesex made Trott's profit match in 1907, Trott's miraculous performance at Lord's against Somerset continues to amaze today
 darasal, trot pratham shrenee kii ek hi pari main do hetric lene vaale pehle gendbaaj ban gaye the
 Somerset needed 264 runs to win on the third day of the match
 ummid thi ki is benifit match ke aakhri din dopaher baad darshak jutenge
 But that match ended very quickly due to the trot's one-two hat-trick
 trot ke liye dhan nahin ugaha ja sakaa
 That is, Trott made a loss of his own
 -hua yun ki summerset kii team ne lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 77 / 2 ran banaae the
 Trott took a hat-trick and the score fell to 77 / 6
 iske baad score 97 / 7 ran tha, to ek baar phir trot ne hetric lekar puri team samet di
 Trott's bowling analysis was 8-2-20-7
 beemaari ke baad depressant main chale gaye the, khudakushi keatrot pehle hi test khilne kii hode se baahar the
 He also distanced himself from first-class cricket in 1910 and tried his hand at umpiring
 is bich vah dropsy (jalodar- pet main pani bharna) naamak beemaari ke shikaar hue
 Gradually Trot started drinking more alcohol
 iske baad lagaataar depressant main rahe
 And finally he shot himself with a pistol
 rochak factalabarta trot ke baad pratham shrenee cricket kii pari main do hetric lene kaa karnama joginder raav ne kiya
 He achieved this feat in his second match against Northern Punjab in 1963–64 in Amritsar

 Also off screen i don't think they look 60's

 ' gauratlab he ki sanjay dutt apana filmi kariyar shuru karne se pehle hi drugs ke aadi ho gaye the or ve kaaphi saalon tak apni is lat ke saath sangharsh karte rahe
 After this, with the help of his father, he went to America for his treatment and after that he made a great comeback in films

 madhya pradesh ke bundelkhand main pani ke sangrakshan or sanvardhan ke liye tarah-tarah ke prayog ho rahe hai
 The people of a village have decided strangely that the amount of labor or contribution that a person or a family makes in the repair of the pond, will be given in proportion to the agricultural irrigation and water for daily use
 shuklan toria tikamgarh jile kii gram panchayat bangaanv ke tahat chota sa gaanv he
 This village is situated on the side of the mountain and there is no road to reach it
 is gaanv main chandelkalin talab he, lekin risaav ke kaaran har saal barish kaa pani kuch maheene tak hi thahar paata he
 From the people of the village, cattle are forced to wander from village to village
 gaanv ke log arase se talab ko sudhaarney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But the administration and the government did not get any help even after pleading
 lihaaja ab gaanvvaalon ne khud hi is kaam kaa bidaa uthaaya
 The residents of Shuklan Tauria tried to repair the pond of their village through the ongoing work under the Integrated Water Management Mission in the surrounding area
 sarpanch leelavati shukla ne bataaya ki unhone talab marammat main 'parmarth samaaj seva' santhaan se sahyog maanga
 When the institution prepared the expense of pond improvement work, the total expenditure was estimated at Rs 3
5 lakh
 santhaan kii shart thi ki marammat kaary main saamudayik hissedari aavashyak he
 For this, the people of the village should contribute Shramdaan or contribution equal to ten percent of the total expenditure on repair
 is gaanv main brahman, pichhadaa or dalit varg ke kul 80 parivaar rahete hai or talab se lagbhag 70 acre jameen kii sinchai hoti he
 a meeting of the people of the village was called on the issue of shramdaan and contribution
 dhaniram ahirwar ne bataaya ki baithak main tay hua ki shramdan kaa to hisaab rakhana mushkil hoga
 Therefore, 10 percent of the total amount spent on repair should be collected between each other for 30 thousand rupees, for which an amount of Rs 412 per acre was fixed on the cultivated land
 sthaneey nivasee baijnath paal ne kaha, 'gaanv ke sabhi log 412 rupee prati acre ke maan se raashi jamaa karne taiyaar ho gaye
 He who has cultivated land has deposited the amount in the same proportion
 talab kii marammat ho rahi he, ummid he ki barish kaa pani is baar barbaad nahin jayega or kheti va dainik upyog ke pani ke liye bhatakana nahin padegaa
 Sanjay Singh, the head of the institute, said, '10 percent of the money has been taken from the villagers to maintain community share
 yahi kaaran he ki gaanv ke log talab ke marammat kaary par na keval najar rakhe hue he, balki gunvattta ko bhi banaae rakhane main sahaayak ban rahe hai
 He said, 'the people of the village themselves keep a record of the expenses
 agar vikaas kaary main samudaay kii hissedari to bhrashtachar kii kahin koi sambhaavna bachati hi nahin he
 'the people of Shuklan Taurio village have contributed to the repair of the pond and tried to write a version of community participation in the development, which may in due course become an inspiration for another village

 In women, emotional pain is reflected in depression, while in men it brings concrete problems

 divangat pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne 1966 main taashkand ke daure ke dauraan apane tatkaaleen soviet sangh ke samakaksh alexi kosigin se tohfe main mili kot ko apane ek karmchaaree ko de diya tha, jisapar alexi ne unhen ‘super communist’ kaha tha
 Shastriji died during this tour
 bharat ke dwitiya pradhanmantri ke bare main is tarah ke kai vaakyon kaa zikr unke bete or sah-lekhak anil shastri or lekhak pawan choudhary ne kitaab ‘laal bahadur shastri : lesans in leadership’ main kiya he
 The book states that the day Shastri was to meet the President of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, on 3 January 1966, it was bitterly cold and he was wearing his Khadi wool coat that day too
 kitaab ke mutabik, kosigin ko laga ki jo kot shastri pahane hue hai vah madhya asia main is barfile sard mausam ke liye utana garm nahin he or vah unhen ek roosi overkot dena chaahate the par udhedbun main the ki kis tarah unhen isaki peshkash karen
 The authors say, at a function, Cosijin finally presented the Russian coat as a gift to the Prime Minister, hoping that he would wear it in Tashkent
 agali subah unhone dekha ki shastriji abhi bhi khaadi un kaa kot hi pahane hue hai, jo vah dilli se laae hue the
 Hesitantly, he asked the Prime Minister whether he liked the coat he was given
 unhone likhaa he, shastriji ne haa main jawaab dete hue kaha vaaki yah kaaphi garm or mere liye kaaphi aaraamdeh he
 However, i have given it to one of my employees, who did not bring a nice woolen coat to wear in this shivering cold
 thande deshon kii apni yatraaon ke dauraan main jarur aapaki bhent kaa istemaal karuunga
 Kosijin referred to the incident during his address at a cultural event organized in honor of Shastri and Khan
 unhone kaha, ham communist hai par pradhanmantri shastri super communist hai
 This book, published by Wisdom Village Publication, has many interesting stories from Shastriji's childhood, youth to political life
 har vaakye kaa zikr unke bete anil ne kiya he
 In the chapter titled 'plain Life, High Thought', the authors mention that while Shastriji was the Home Minister, his sons were studying at St
 Columbia School in New Delhi
 ek din beton ne apane pita se shikaayat kii ki sarkari adhikariyon ke bachche car se aate hai, jabaki ve taange se skool jate hai
 Shastriji told him that he would be able to get the facility of transport to school by car as long as he would be the Home Minister and in later days he would feel bad about going to Tanga again
 bacchon ko apane pita ke siddhant kaa ahsaas hua or unhone tanga se hi jane kaa nirnay kiya
 The book also mentions those aspects of how Shastri dealt with issues of administration and politics in times of crisis like the 1965 war
 ek anya adhyay main anil ne is baat kaa bhi ullekh kiya he ki titike naam se mashhoor tatkaaleen vitt mantri titi krishnaamchaaree ke istife se unke pita kaise nipate the
 He wrote, i remember that my father talked over the telephone to the then Congress President Kamaraj who was in Chennai at the time and told him that he had accepted ttk's resignation and appointed Sachindra Chaudhary as the new Finance Minister
 mere nikat sambandhi kaushal kumaar us kamare main maujuud the or achraj main pad gaye ki kya congress adhyaksh shastriji se is baat ke liye naaraaz honge ki aisa nirnay se pehle unase vichaar-vimarsh kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Shastriji told him humbly and firmly, the Prime Minister has the privilege of who should be kept in the cabinet and who does not and he does not want to lose his privilege in any way

 Replying to the discussion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah lashed out at the Congress party
 isi dauraan jab amit shah panchayat chunaav par bol rahe the, to bagal main baithe rajnath singh ne yaad dilaayaa ki ye rajeev gandhi kaa hi sapana tha
 Soon after this, Shah also said this in his speech and took a dig at the Congress
 darasal, amit shah kashmir par charchaa ke dauraan jawaab de rahe the
 During this time he said that the Congress governments never let the people of Kashmir choose their Panchayat chief, only 3 families ruled under his rule
 amit shah ne kaha ki aaj ghati main 40 hajaar sarpanch apana kaam kar rahe hai, modi sarkaar ne aam logon ko adhikaar diya he
 When Union Home Minister was speaking, Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said in his ear that this was Rajiv Gandhi's dream
 phir kya amit shah ne bhi turant iskaa tanj congress par kas diya
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the policy of humanity, Jamuriyat, Kashmiriyat is still going on

 Premium charges apply !! doodh kaa jala chacha bhi phoonk-phoonk kar peetaa he, ye kahawat gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par bijepi ke liye sateek baith rahi he
 CM Yogi Adityanath has started special social engineering in view of the defeat in the by-elections and the deteriorating caste equation
 bijepi ummidavaar bhojpuri star ravi kishan ke liye siem yogi damakham se maidan main utar gaye hai
 The CM himself is holding meetings and public meetings to organize ethnic mathematics
 isse pehle ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko aisi kadi mashkkat nahin kerani padi thi
 Before the by-election, the BJP used to get a unilateral vote in the name of Math
 lekin yogi ke siem banane ke baad hue upachunaav main yah myth tut gaya
 With the support of the BSP, SP candidate Pravin Nishad won the election
 jo ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 The byelection is said to have shown the mirror to the yogi
 sapa-basapa main gathbandhan ke saath hi yah tay ho gaya ki agar gorakhpur kii seat bijepi ko bachaani he to un galatiyon se sabak siikhnaa hoga jo upachunaav ke parinaam ke baad hue manthan main nikali thim
 The biggest lesson of the by-election defeat was that BJP was in over confidence
 jaateey sameekaran ko halke main lenaa duusari bhul maani gai
 It was also believed that voters were not persuaded how important it was for them to vote
 iske alaava alag-alag virgon ko ekajute na karnaa bhi badi bhul maani gai
 In view of this, Yogi has changed the strategy this time
 gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par siem yogi adityanath 10 se 17 may ke bich kareeb 14 sabhaayen khud karne vaale hai
 bjp's social engineering is going on to accommodate every section in this parliamentary seat of 5 assemblies
 siem yogi adityanath 14 may ko khajani or dohariya main jansabha karenge
 BJP national president Amit Shah is arriving in Gorakhpur on 16 May
 amit shah kii sabha se bijepi ko phaayde ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 After this, on May 17, CM Yogi will address a public meeting at Harpur Budhat
 vahiin, ravi kishan apane purvajon ke gaanv mamkhor main campaning karke khud ko gorakhpur kaa laal bataa chuke hai
 BJP leader Nitin Bakshi said that the BJP is contesting elections with full power
 har str par party kii taiyaari mahagathbandhan se majboot he
 He said that CM Yogi Adityanath has met every president and a prominent activist of about 2300 booths
 unhen unki jimmedaari saunp di gai he
 CM himself is continuously holding public meetings
 saath hi ravi kishan bhi door tu door campaning kar rahe hai
 Local journalist Manoj Singh said that this time in Gorakhpur, the election battle has become interesting
 nomination ke baad siem yogi khilaadiyon, vakeelon, vyapaariyon se alag-alag mili hai
 Apart from this, there is a campaigning among the Brahmins, Kayasthas, people of the Sikh community
 is tarah kii soshal ejineering pehle bijepi ne nahin kii thi
 Overall, we can say that BJP is working hard here, but how successful it will be, it is difficult to say
 is seat par nishad voter hi jeet-haar tay karenge
 Manoj Singh said that Nishad Party President Sanjay Nishad and his MP son have also started campaigning for Ravi Kishan
 nishad votaron ko saadhane kii badi jimmedaari sahi myne main sanjay nishad par hi he, lekin mahagathbandhan se bhi nishad (rambhual nishad) candidet he
 In such a situation, it is a challenge to move the Nishad voters towards the Brahmin candidate
 manoj singh ne kaha ki beete upachunaav main sanjay nishad sapa ke saath the, lekin ab vah bijepi main aa chuke he
 Therefore, it is a big challenge to cultivate Nishad
 patrkaar manoj singh ne kaha ki upachunaav se bijepi ne sabak liya he
 Perhaps CM is also constantly campaigning among the Nishad society
 is baar sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne ram bhuaal nishad ko utaara he
 Ram Bhuyal Nishad was on the BSP ticket in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 unhen yogi adityanath ne 362715 voton se haraaya tha
 Rambhual received 176412 votes
 duusare number par sapa kii rajmati nishad thim, jinhen 2,26,344 vot mili the

 In Melbourne he scored a brilliant century for Team India

 After Rohit Sharma opened the account without Shikhar Dhawan, he first scored the Indian innings and then scored a great century
 shikhar dhawan ne 146 gend par 16 chauke or 2 chakke kii madad se 137 ran banaae
 His strike rate was over 93 during this innings

 He is just the third batsman to score a century for India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
 unase pehle saurav ganguli or rohit sharma ke naam is maidan par shatak kaa record tha
 In India's first two matches, Shikhar Dhawan batted strongly for Team India, and has shown that he is going to prove to be a trump card for Team India in this World Cup

 In just 55 odis, Dhawan has completed his seven centuries, that is, Dhawan is scoring a century before every eighth ODI

 By the way, a special feature with Shikhar Dhawan is that whenever he has scored a century, Team India has managed to win in that ODI, will Shikhar Dhawan's century prove to be lucky in Melbourne

 a post shared by Adah Sharma (@adah_ki_adah) on Jun 14, 2018 at 10:59pm PDT Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray asked why Pakistani artists are being given such a grand welcome in India
 ek saanskrithik kaarykram main thakare ne kaha ki vah kisi bhi kala yaa kalakaar ke khilaaf nahin hai lakin jis tareeke se desh main pakistani kalakaaron kaa swaagat hota he, use vah pasand nahin karte
 He asked if Asha Bhosle or Lata Mangeshkar were invited to the program in Pakistan? If not, why should we invite Pakistani artists? Thackeray said that the participation of Pakistani artists in the music reality show 'sur Kshetra' is not appropriate
 bharat-pakistan match se pehle kuch to baat he ki dhadakanen tej hone lagati hai
 Regardless of the number of matches you have seen in about 125 matches between them

 In every match, there is a moment that becomes part of the life of the fans
 world cap main ravivaar ko hone vaale match se pehle pakistan ke captain misbah-ul-haq ne puche jane par khulkar kaha ki ye match puri tarah dabaav kaa he
 He also said that how you think about this match in the dressing room, it all affects its outcome
 captain kool maahi bhi maanate hai ki yah match duusare maichon se thodaa alag zarur hota he, lekin unka maananaa he ki unki koshish yah rahati he ki is 'thode alag' factor ko bahut kam kar den
 Captain Cool Mahi also says that the role of fans becomes very important in these matches, so the thrill increases
 world cap main chhathi baar bhidnt se pehle donon hi timen apni takat ke bare main bataakar apni daavedaari pesh kar rahi hai, lekin donon hi captain badhachadh kar daawa karne se batch rahe hai
 In fact, both teams have gone through difficulties to reach the World Cup

 Aamir Khan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have a different kind of relationship that is not usually seen between a celebrity and a politician
 haal hi main bollywood sitaron ne soshal media par deshavaasiyon se vot daalane kii apil kii thi
 Modi, especially taking reference to Aamir and Salman's film Andaz Apna Apna, said that stars like you should motivate people to cast their votes
 aamir khan ne bhi piem ke is twit kaa riplai kiya tha or kaha tha ki vot daalana kisi bhi loktantr main bahut badi jimmedaari he
 On his 54th birthday, Aamir was asked if he would support the BJP in the general elections, then Aamir made it clear that he does not support any political party
 Voting is not only a right but it’s also a duty
 Dear @ beingsalmankhanand @ aamir_khan, It is time to inspire and motivate youth in your own Andaz to vote so that we can strengthen Apna Democracy & Apna country
 — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)march 13, 2019aamir khan or narendra modi ke bich utaar-chadhaav dekhne ko milte rahe hai
 On 15 April 2006, Aamir supported activist Medha Patekar performing at Jantar Mantar
 medha us samay gujarat sarkaar ke ek faisle kaa virodh kar rahi thi jisamen ye kaha gaya tha ki sardaar sarovar baandh kii lambaai badhaai jaaegi
 During that time Aamir's film Rang De Basanti was about to be released and he along with his entire team came to support Medha
 aamir kii narmada bachaao andolan main sakriyata dekhakar kai log hairaan hue the
 Earlier, Aamir had criticized Modi for the 2002 Gujarat riots
 unhone kaha tha ki ek chif ministar hone ke naate modi sthiti ko apane kaabo main nahin kar paae
 Hundreds of people lost their lives
 jaahir he, aamir kaa ye bayaan gujarat sarkaar ko nagavar gujara or gujarat main saal 2006 main ai unki film phna ko anadhikarik rup se bain kar diya gaya
 Apart from this, his film Taare Zameen Par in 2007 also faced a lot of opposition in Gujarat
 aamir ne saaf kiya tha ki ve narmada baandh ke construction ke virodh main nahin hai lekin ve chaahate hai ki jin logon ko is baandh ke banane ke chalate apni jameen se haath dhonaa padaa he, unki rihaayash ke liye sarkaar jaruri intjaam karen
 He also said that he will not apologize to anyone because he has the right to speak

 a post shared byaamir Khan(@_aamirkhan) onjan 19, 2019 at 11:56am psthalamki modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad donon ke rishte main badlaav dekhne ko mila
 In 2014, within a month of Modi becoming PM, Aamir Khan met him and shared pictures of this meeting on social media
 unhone piem ke mahatvakankshi project svachh bharat abhiyaan main bhi apana saport dene kii baat kahi thi
 After this, Aamir Khan came under target of many people after his controversial statement in 2015
 endie sarkaar ke power main aane ke baad desh main ashishnutaa se judi kai ghatnaayen dekhne ko mili
 Regarding this, Aamir Khan had said that according to the situation of the country at the moment, according to my wife, she is not feeling very safe
 aamir ke is bayaan par unhen jabardast virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Brand Snapdeal, which is being promoted by Aamir on social media, also suffered its sting
 haalanki film rang de basanti ke 10 saal puure hone par unhone saaf kiya tha ki unke bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya or logon ne is masale ko zarurat se zyada tool diya or unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki media ke kuch hisse ne unke bayaan ko twist diya
 He had made it clear that the beauty of our country is unity in diversity
 aamir ne kaha tha ki jo log desh main negativity failaa rahe hai, unase meri haath jodakar guzarish he ki ve aisa naa karen
 View this post on instagramgehri soch :-) a post shared byaamir Khan (@_ aamirkhan) onjan 13, 2019 at 7:48 am PST Since then Aamir has met with PM Modi on several occasions
 ve maharashtra sarkaar ke saath pani ke ek project main bhi active hai
 He has once discussed how the Indian film industry can contribute to the economic conditions of the country in the PMO
 iske alaava janvari 2019 main mumbai main bhi neshnal musium of indian cinema ke udghaatan par donon kii mulaakaat hui thi
 It will be interesting to see what changes will happen in the relationship between Aamir and Modi after the Lok Sabha elections
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke 'janeudhari hindu' hone ke party ke daawey par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad dow
 Subramanian Swamy said that 47-year-old Gandhi's descendants had to wear janeu for their father's funeral
 iske saath hi swami ne congress party ko 'ek parivaar kii dharmashala' bataate hue kaha ki isamen koi adhyaksh bane isse kuch fark nahin padataa
 Let me tell you that Rahul Gandhi has filed nomination papers for the post of Congress Party President on Monday and he is fully expected to be elected against it
 rahul gandhi ke hindu hone ke sawaal par swami ne media se kaha ki use jabaran baahar se janeu pahananaa padaa nahin to vah apane pita kii antyeshti main bhaag nahin le sakate the
 Swami said about Rahul that when he confesses that he is a Shiva devotee, what is the problem of him accepting that he is a Hindu? You say i go to the temple, i am a Shiva devotee, then your colleague fills his name in the non-hindu register in the Somnath temple
 us register ko maangana hota he
 His assistant had called for the register and told the priest that the names of two non-hindus were to be written
 sach kya he, bataa dijiye
 Are you a Hindu or not
 ek minute main sara vivaad khatm ho saktaa tha
 On the question of religion being a private subject, he said, see, lying is not religion
 aapane kaha ki main shivbhakt hum or register main kaha ki mangaiyr hinduhun
 You said i did not fill the register, the assistant filled it
 usne aapke dastakhat bhi kiye hai
 The BJP leader claimed that the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya will start soon and next year we will celebrate Deepawali at the Ram temple in Ayodhya itself
 unhone kaha ki maine dekha he ki hamaare tark kya hai or pratidwandi ke tark main koi dam nahin he
 He has lost in the Allahabad High Court, has now come on appeal, but has not kept anything new, so i believe that we are sure to win in the court
 ek sawaal ke uttar main swami ne kaha ki gujarat membijepiki jeet nishchat he
 On the question of bringing liquor baron Vijay Mallya back to the country, Swamy said that the government is engaged, will not spare anyone
 jiesti par swami ne kaha ki nayaa kar dhaancha lagu hone ke baad ab desh kii jidipi dhire-dhire badhani shuru ho rahi he
 Similarly, after the ban on demonetisation, everyone said that this will harm the BJP, but after this the BJP won heavily in the Vidhan Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh

 bhartiya sena pramukh general bipin ravat guuruuvaar ko sikkim pahunche hai
 The Army Chief will visit the border area here and review the situation
 ye daura isliye ahm he kyonki sikkim border par pichley do din se china kii dadaageeri saamne ai he
 China has stopped the journey of Kailash Mansarovar
 tirthayatriyon ko border se waapas lautaa diya he
 China has been threatening India for the last two days on the pretext of tension on the border
 sena pramukh kaa ye daura haalanki pehle se tay tha, lekin ye china ke saath chal rahe border par tanaav ke taaja halaat ke bich bahut mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 General Bipin Rawat will visit the forward post along the Sikkim border and review the security situation with senior commanders
 bulldozer se todaa bunkerisase pehle buudhvaar ko ek baar phir khabar ai ki china ne bharat or bhutan ke saath lagi apni seemaa par sthit bhartiya sena ke ek puraane bunker ko bulldozer kaa istemaal karte hue hataa diya
 According to the information, the incident of removal of the Indian bunker occurred in the Doka La area of sikkim in the first week of June, causing tension on the indo-china border in the Sikkim region
 bharat-china ke bich jammu-kashmir se lekar arunachal pradesh tak 3,488 kilometre kii seemaa he
 Out of this 220 km falls in Sikkim
 khabaron ke anusaar china ne us vakt bulldozer jaisi baari mashinari kaa istemaal karte hue puraane bunker ko jabaran hataaya, jab bharat ise hataane ke china ke aagrah par taiyaar nahin hua
 Before the Mansarovar Yatra halted, China's Foreign Ministry had alleged that Indian soldiers had crossed the border in Sikkim to its territory
 china ke videsh mantralay or raksha mantralay ne ise bhartiya javaanon kii ghuspaith kaha or peeche hat jane ko kaha
 Due to this, China also stopped the visit of Kailash Mansarovar, and returned 50 Indians of the first batch
 china ke videsh mantralay ne kaha ki jab tak bharat ke sainik peeche nahin hatenge tab tak wo maansarovar yatra nahin hone degaa
 China's dispute not only with India, but also with Bhutan, China's official newspaper Global Times wrote that whichever way India has to teach the lesson of rules, it should be taught
 ab china ne ye kehete hue sikkim border par bhartiya sena ke ek puraane bunker ko tod diya, ki bharat uskaa kahana nahin maan rahaa
 On the Sikkim border place where China is constructing a road in Donglong, India objected, because the area where China is constructing the road, it comes in the area of bhutan as well as India
 sikkim ke border se judaa hua ye wo ilaaka he, jahaan par china kaa bharat ke saath hi nahin bhutan ke saath bhi vivaad he
 Even in 2008, Bunkerchin said that it is right to build its road because this area is neither from India nor Bhutan
 china ne 1890 kii british raaj kii sandhi kaa hawala dete hue sikkim border ke paas ke ilaake ko apana bataaya he
 Even China said that according to this 127-year-old treaty, the ancient name of Sikkim is Zhi and the area in which India is objecting to the construction of the road, there has been no dispute about the boundary of the area
 lekin sachai ye he ki sikkim border par china pehle bhi dadaageeri dikhaata rahaa he, 2008 main bhi usne sena ke bunker tode the
 China has been continuously trying to build roads and occupy land along the border connecting Tibet to Sikkim and Bhutan
 bharat-america dosti se jala chinais baar ye maamla tab saamne aayaa he, jab bharat or america kii dosti nae sire se apadet hui he

 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bharat-america kii sachhee dosti se china kaa dil jal gaya he

 While Rahul Gandhi is praising the debt waiver scheme of the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh, many farmers of the state are in a state of confusion about this scheme
 vajah he ki is yojana kaa kriyanvayan kaise hoga unke niyam kya hai ye saaf nahin hue hai
 Many farmers have even threatened to take revenge in the Lok Sabha elections if they are cheated
 
 
 kuch khush hai
 
 
 There are some ways, on which the government works, then they do not need debt waiver
 45 saal ke sanjay yadav thunakhurd main rahete hai
 There are 4 acres of farming, which raises a family of 6 people
 philhal genhu lagaaya he
 Eggplant in the remaining portion
 sarkari bank se ek lakh, 90 hajaar kaa karj he
 The cooperative bank has a total debt of two and a half million
 sarkaar ne karj maafee kaa elaan kiya, lekin sanjay khush nahin hai
 Sanjay says that, 'when we took the loan, it has to be reversed every 6 months
 ham maheenaa bhar let hote hai to bank vaale massej karte hai uske bhi paise lagate hai
 Due to fear, due to the pressure, we collect money for one day by lifting it and withdraw it again the next day
 ek din kaa paisa sahuukaar se lenaa padataa he ek din kaa vah 2 se 3 hajaar bhi le letaa he
 Personally, there will be no benefit
 june-july main palati kar aayaa, kyonki march main fasal bhi nahin biki thi to ham paisa laae kahaan se
 At the same time, Chauthmal Yadav of Abdullapur has about 3 acres of cultivation
 sosayadi or bank of india ko milakar lagbhag ek lakh kaa karj he
 The bank did not give the money until 31 March
 ab khush hai ki puraa karj maaf ho jayega
 Chauthamal said, 'we are happy with the government
 udhar, suraj yadav ke ghar main 22 logon kaa parivaar he, genhu or chanaa boyaa he
 There is about 5 acres of farming, there is a debt of 1
5 lakh
 kesisi se ghar kharch ke liye karj liya tha
 Still happy to take back a new loan
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar banakar aegi bahut had tak kisaanon ko madad milegi
 Raju Rathore of Jamunia Talab planted wheat on 4 acres, it costs 70-80 thousand
 fasal bechakar itnaa hi paisa miltaa he
 There is no water; i took a loan to dig a well for irrigation
 lagbhag 3 lakh kaa karj he, khush he ki 2 lakh maaf ho jayega
 Currently defaulter
 raju rathod ne kaha, karj chukaa nahin paaya tha, fasal nahin hui thi, kuch to maaf ho jayega
 It is a great relief
 dhanyavad he mukhyamantri ji kaa, sinchai ho to dikkat nahin aae, sahi mulya or sinchai par dhyaan diya to karj maafee kii jarurat nahin padegi
 At the same time, 37-year-old Naveen Mewada is a resident of Pacham
 pani kii kami thi so dedh acre main phool laga liye, 31 march se pehle 90 hajaar kaa karj bhar diya
 Then i took a loan in April
 wo sarkaar se khush nahin hai
 Naveen said, 'I took out a loan in April of 80, 000 double, then Rahul Gandhi said that he will forgive the debt, thinking that the government will be ours or not, the new promise given after March 31 will be forgiven
 We will not
 vachanapatr main taarikh likhni thi
 The rules have come so much here, every farmer being a defaulter fills money
 sihor jile ke colector tarun pithode ne kaha, puure jile main lagbhag 2 lakh kisaan hai, jisamen akele sahakaari bainkon ke 53000 difolter he
 They owe about Rs 240 crore
 sarkaar karz maafee ke liye ek online portal banaayegi jisamen kisaanon ko apana panjikaran karana hoga
 For this, the Aadhar card will be necessary, so that many accounts of the farmer can be sorted, because the loan waiver will be from a single account
 sarkari karmchaaree, inakam tex or 15000 kii pension vaale kisaanon ko bhi is skim se dur rakhaa jayega
 The duration of the scheme has been kept from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2018, there will be no loan waiver from the later date
 bas isi se kisaan naaraaz hai
 This is the discussion from the farm to the market
 sihor jile ke baad ham vidisha ke madvaai pahunche
 
 
 The village is rich in Pusa Basmati and its sorbet wheat, but here too people believe that more issues than debt forgiveness are in front of them
 vidisha mandi main philhal chanaa, soyabean pahunch rahaa he
 Here too, farmers say that if there is cash in the market, there is no need to take a loan if you get the right price for the crop
 sarkaar paise jutaney ke liye bond bechney or andhrapradesh kii tarj par sarkari bainkon ko 3-5 saal main byaaj sahit paise lautaane ke bare main soch rahi he
 The Congress is treating the farmers' displeasure as an illusion, while the BJP feels that the debt waiver is a sham
 congress pravaktaa pankaj chaturvedi ne kaha ki kisi prakaar kii bhram kii sthiti nahin he
 The Congress has fulfilled its promise
 31 march ke saare lone samaapt kiya gaya he
 4 xxrep 4 0 crore loan has been waived
 iske baad bhi koi visangati he to koi bhram he to use dur karenge, kyonki ye vaayada rahul ji kaa he use nibhaane sarkaar patibaddh bhi he samarpit bhi
 At the same time, former Cooperation Minister Vishwas Sarang said, 'this is political stunting is a hoax
 bataa den ki madhyapradesh sarkaar lagbhag 1 lakh 87 hajaar karod ke karje main he
 In such a situation, the government is robbing applause from the announcement, but a slight laxity in the implementation will annoy the farmer if the economy already derailed does not fall into a hole
 andhra pradesh kaa vijiangaram loksabhaa seat pradesh ke uttar main sthit he

 court ke notice par 30 april ko arvind kejariwal ko court main pesh hona hoga
 Apart from Arvind Kejriwal, the Patiala House Court has also ordered three more Aam Aadmi Party leaders to appear before it
 jisamen east dilli se is baar loksabhaa chunaav ke liye aam aadmi party kii pratyaashee aatishi merlina, rajyasabha saansad susheel gupta or kondli se vidhayak manoj kumaar shaamil he
 a defamation suit was filed against the chief minister on behalf of BJP leader Rajiv Babbar
 bijepi netaa kaa aarope tha ki mukhyamantri ne soshal media par logon ko bijepi ke khilaaf bhadakaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Lied to the voters that the vote of Vaishya and some other castes has been cut by BJP
 rajeev babbar ne apni yachika main kaha he ki yah puri tarah se managasaint or bijepi ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh ke tahat jaanboojhkar kiya gaya he
 Which includes Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and some leaders of his party
 rajeev babbar kaa aarope he ki aam aadmi party kii taraf se votaron ke paas phone ja rahe the jisamen aap ke party kaaryakarta yah bataa rahe the ki unke vot ko bijepi ne katwa diya he
 But the Aam Aadmi Party has re-added their vote to the voter list
 is tarah ke phone kol kuch un logon ko bhi gaye jinka voter list main naam kuch or tha jabaki phone unhen kisi or voter ke liye kiya gaya
 Or those whose name was already cut due to change of place
 or duusari jagah se bataur voter vah apana voter idi card banavaa chuke the
 Not only this, some BJP workers also got this call
 jiske baad donon partiyon ke bich main isko lekar ghamaasan chhid gaya or maamla court tak pahunch gaya
 But the most interesting thing in this is that after the defamation case came to the court, when the hearing started in the court and after noting the Election Commission, the court wanted to go to it, the Election Commission said that they do not have any such data of the voters In which any information about their caste or religion is with the Election Commission
 iske alaava chunaav ayog ne apane halafname main court main saaf kar diya ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal kaa chunaav ayog ke kaaryaklap main kisi tarah kaa koi dakhal nahin he
 All the information given in the court by the Election Commission went in favor of Rajiv Babbar and after that Kejriwal was summoned to appear in the court in this case

 In such a situation, a partisan view of the deal in the Shiv Sena is emerging in favor of recovering the price of its support
 rajya main behatar or malaaidaar vibhaag apane khate main chadha lene ke badale main samarthan diya ja saktaa he
 The comments party ke paas philhal 5 cabinet vibhaag hai, jinamein paryaavaran, udyog, swasthya, parivahan or vibhajit lokanirmaan vibhaag hai, lekin unki najar rajasav or grih vibhaagon par tiki he

 Earlier, party chief Uddhav Thackeray had said that Kovind would not support the NDA candidate if only Dalit votes were chosen

 The Shiv Sena never did politics by making someone a shield
 uddhav ne kaha ki shivasena ne emes swaminathan kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke liye sujhaayaa tha, jisase kisaanon ko phayda miltaa
 Shiv Sena will open its cards today

 For the last time, the star whose roar is heard most at the box office is Salman Khan, and this time also his film 'ek Tha Tiger', released under the Yash Raj banner, was released on the occasion of Eid
 - Six days' earnings have broken all the next-previous records, but rather it looks like this film will break the remaining records of earnings too soon
 
 
 salmaan khan kii 'ek tha tiger' kis kadar hit rahi he, iskaa andaaza is baat se behad aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sirf id ke din hi uski collection 20 karod rupee se zyaada rahi, or yah film 100 karod kaa kaarobaar karne vaali filmon kii fehrist main sabase kam dinon main aisa karne vaali film ke taur par shumaar ho gai
 
 
 According to film business experts, the collection of 'ek Tha Tiger' will be better till Wednesday
 
 
 komal nahata ke mutabik unhen lagata he ki aane vaale dinon main 'ek tha tiger' salmaan khan kii hi 'dabang' or 'bodyguard' ke ab tak kiye kaarobaar ke aankade ko paar kar legi
 
 
 According to Nahata, 'ek Tha Tiger' will not only make a collection of Rs 150 crores easily, but if it stays the same, then it can also surpass Aamir Khan's super hit film 'three Idiots' by crossing 200 crores
 
 
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that this is Salman Khan's fifth consecutive hit film since 2009, while four of these films 'dabangg', 'ready', 'bodyguard' and now 'ek Tha Tiger' have crossed the 100 crore mark, However, 'wanted', which came in 2009 and became a huge hit, could not touch this figure
 
 
 in paanch hit filmon ne ab tak kul milakar 600 karod rupee ke kaarobaar kaa aankada paar kar liya he, or yah rakam philhal sirf badhati hi dikhaai de rahi he
 
 
 But the most interesting thing is that Salman Khan is not going to stop, and he is already preparing for the next Eid
 
 
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah apane bhai sohail khan ke production house main ban rahi khud kii film 'sherkhan' ko agali id par release karnaa chaahate hai
 
 
 So come, let's wait, thinking that when 'tiger' has done this awesome, what will the 'lion' do

 According to Komal Nahata, he feels that in the coming days, 'ek Tha Tiger' will surpass the business figures of Salman Khan's 'dabangg' and 'bodyguard' so far
 
 
 nahata ke mutabik 'ek tha tiger' na sirf 150 karod rupee kaa collection aasaani se kar legi, balki yahi alam rahaa to vah 200 karod kaa aankada paar kar aamir khan kii superhit film 'thri idiyats' kii barabari bhi kar sakati he
 
 
 The comments ullekhneey he ki yah salmaan khan kii varsh 2009 ke baad lagaataar paanchavin hit film he, jabaki inamen se chaar filmon 'dabang', 'ready', 'bodyguard' or ab 'ek tha tiger' ne 100 karod kaa aankada paar kar liya he, haalanki varsh 2009 main ai or jabardast hit rahi 'wonted' is aankade ko nahin chhu pai thi
 
 
 These five hit films have so far crossed the Rs 600 crore turnover mark overall, and the amount seems to be only increasing at the moment
 
 
 lekin sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki salmaan khan rukne vaale nahin hai, or vah abhi se agali id kii taiyaari main jute hai
 
 
 It is believed that he wants to release his brother Sohail Khan's production house 'sherkhan' on the next Eid
 
 
 to aaie, intazaar karte hai, yah sochate hue ki jab 'tiger' ne yah kamaal kiya he, to 'sher' kya dhamal karegaa

 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj tweeted on micro-blogging website Twitter, the breakdown of NDA is sad and unfortunate
 tippaniyan It is worth noting that after the bjp's Goa conference, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was made the chairman of bjp's election campaign committee and related developments, JDU made a formal announcement to separate from NDA today

 Nitish said, BJP is going through a new phase
 ham usase sahamat nahin hai
 We cannot compromise our basic principles

 nitish kumaar chaahate the ki bijepi yah ghoshnaa kare ki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banaaya jayega
 JDU president Sharad Yadav resigned from the post of NDA convenor and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommended to the Governor to remove BJP ministers
 nitish ne kaha, bijepi nae daur se guzar rahi he
 We do not agree with that
 ham apane buniyadi usulon se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Nitish Kumar wanted the BJP to announce that Narendra Modi would not be made the prime ministerial candidate
 bhartiya janata party is samay apni puri takat narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par ubhaarne main jhenk rahi hai
 Where Modi goes, what he speaks, he makes headlines
 modi to kya, unke raajnneetik chele amit shah bhi uttar pradesh ke prabharee banane ke baad se behatar samachar saamagree pradaata banakar ubhare hai
 But with a cool mind, what has this rise of Modi given to the BJP besides controversies
 ve chunaav prachaar samiti ke mukhiya bhale hi ek maheene pehle bane hon, lekin unka naam hawa main lambey samay se tair rahaa he
 And during this period, the BJP lost the power of Uttarakhand to the Congress
 iske baad himachal main bhi bijepi kaa suryaast ho gaya
 In Karnataka, Modi campaigned a lot, but the result was the same which was already predicted
 kisi dakshini rajya main pehali baar bani bijepi sarkaar buree tarah chunaav haari or kaman congress ke haath chali gai
 The bitterness between LK Advani and Modi, who put the party on its feet, increased to such an extent that the elderly leader resigned from his post
 baad main sangh ke maan manwwal ke baad adwani maan to gaye lekin bijepi or sangh ke itihaas main pehali baar sangh itnaa rajnatik dikhaa
 The Sangh chief added the thread of love between BJP and Advani, but the doctors in Nagpur could not erase the knots lying in it
 or sabase bada jhtka party ko bihar main laga, jahaan jediu ke saath uskaa dedh dashak se purana rishta ek jatke main tut gaya
 In the same period, the BJP also lost its government in Jharkhand
 modi ko lekar bijepi jitna aage badhati ja rahi he, uski jameen utani hi khisakati ja rahi he
 On the other hand, the UPA-2 government, which has been decorated in its necklaces beaded by countless scams, is going away
 uskaa koi sahyogi jab naaraaz hota he, usase pehle hi congress nae sahyogi ko taiyaar rakhti he
 It may take political bargaining to see the attitude of Congress, but it is succeeding
 pehle mamata gayi, phir karunanidhi
 And when it felt that the Congress was making a mess, then the anti-sp and BSP came together with it
 ab jab sapa ankhen tarer rahi he to congress ke paas jediu kii sanjivani maujuud he
 It would be unfair to tell Congress mistakes from JDU just a matter of time
 darasal yah to congress kii doorgaami ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 From the beginning, the Congress was in the mood that one day the leaf of secularism would run and JDU would quit the BJP
 agar aisa nahin tha to congress ne us par jaan chhidqane vaale lalu prasad yadav ko upie do main lakh koshishon ke baavjood shaamil nahin hone diya, jabaki rajd se ek seat zyada rakhane vaale ajit singh centre main naagarik uddyan mantri hai
 If everything goes at this pace, then soon the JMM government in Jharkhand will stand with the support of the Congress and in return the Congress will get the right to contest 10 seats in the state for the Lok Sabha
 yani congress badi khamoshi se apni ranneeti par aage bad rahi he
 The Congress has exposed its strategic yearning by bringing a food security ordinance before the election
 sabase maje kii baat he ki bijepi ne modi kaa hallaa machaakar logon ke dimag se congress ke ghotaalon kii yaad ko hi kamjor kiya he
 And cases like Raghavji happening in between will prove to be bjp's trouble makers
 congress chuppi main jeet kii ummid lagaae baithi he to bijepi modi kii hunkaar ko vijaynaad maan rahi he
 Congress is ahead in the bets so far
 lekin kal kii netagiri aaj ke halaat se tay ho yah jaruri nahin he
 Because if it were, there would be no need to hold elections to form governments
 vaise bhi baton-baton main sarkaar gir bhale hi jaae, lekin banate to kisi ne nahin dekhi he

 This glacial earth is not a desert-ridden, but it has gone from north to south like a few miles long curved zigzag line with black vegetation on the hills on both sides
 aaiye, is vanapankti ko kuch sameep se dekhen
 There are more than two types of trees in it - a white-bulkier, but nowadays Nishchatra Bhurj (bhojpatra); And other very simple quotes
 samakon par shakhaon ko failaaye atiharith yaa krishna-rahit sui-se pattee vaale deodara
 No matter how much part of the trees are covered with snow, the snow on their branches and skulls makes them Krishna-white and pull their eyes towards them

 No membrane chimes come from anywhere, neither bird's tweet, nor animal's word

 It may be eight cubits or more thick
 abaki saal barf zyada pad rahi he, yah shikaayat sabhi ko he
 What does a cedar look like? Same snow, same vegetation, same high mountain land
 haan, pahari kii duusari ore ek jagah dhuaan uth rahaa he
 In this creature-word-zero Aranyani, the rise of dhoom is curiosity
 chalo, vahaan chalakar apane kautuhal ko mitaayen
 Smoke was very far away, but in the clean uninterrupted sky, it seemed very close to us
 chalakar ab ham uske najadik pahunch gayi hai
 The fat lying in the fire and the smell of flesh is coming in our nose
 or ab to shabd bhi sunai de rahe hai ye chote bacchon ke shabd hai
 We will not have to walk silently with feet and breath, or else they will know, and then do not know what kind of reception they or their dogs will give
 haan, sachmuch hi chote-chote bachche hai, inamen sabase bada aath saal se adhik kaa nahin he, or chota to ek varsh kaa he
 Half a dozen boys and a house
 ghar nahin yah swaabhaavik parvat-guha he, jiske parshv or pichley bhaag andhkaar main kahan tak chale gayi hai, ise ham nahin dekh rahe hai, or na dekhne kii koshish kerani chahie ! or sayaane aadmi ? ek budhiya jiske san jaise dhoomil shwet kesh uljhe tathaa jataaon ke rup main is tarah bikhare hue hai ki uskaa munh unamem dhakaa hua he
 Now the old lady removed her hairstyle by hand
 uski bhauhen bhi safed hai, shwet chehre par jhurriyaan padi hui hai, jo jaan padati hai sabhi munh ke bheetar se nikal rahi hai
 There is also fire smoke and heat inside the cavity, especially where the children and our grandmother are
 daadi ke sharir par koi vastra nahin, koi aavaran nahin
 Both his dry hands are lying on the ground near the feet
 uski ankhen bheetar ghusi hai, or halake nile rang kii putaliyaan nistej shunya-si hai, kintu bich-bich main unamem tej uchhal jaataa he jisase jaan padataa he ki unki jyoti bilkul chali nahin gai he
 The ears seem very alert
 daadi ladakon kii aawaaj ko acchhee tarah sun rahi jaan padati he
 Just then a child shouted, his eye turned around
 baras-deb- baras ke do bachche hai, jinamein ek ladkaa or ek ladki, kad donon ke baraabar hai
 Both the hairs are white with a slight yellowish appearance, like an old woman: but more shiny, more lively
 unka sharir pivar pusht, arun gaur, unki ankhen vishaal, putaliyaan ghani neeli
 The boy is crying, the girl is sucking a small bone standing in her mouth
 daadi ne boodhaape ke compit swar main kaha-"agin ! aa 
 Come here! Grandma here
 "agin uth nahin rahaa tha
 At that time, an eight-year-old boy came and took him to his grandmother on his lap
 is ladke ke kesh bhi chote bachche ke se hi pandu-shwet hai, kintu ve adhik lambe hai, unamem adhik laten padi hui hai
 The character of his naked naked body is also noticed
 kintu vah utana pivar nahin he; or usamen jagah-jagah kaali mile lipati hui he
 The older boy stood up to the grandmother and said - "grandmother! Rochana snatched the bone
 agin rota 
 
 ladkaa chalaa gaya
 Grandma raised Agin with her dry hands
 vah ab bhi ro rahaa tha
 a flowing stream of his tears had drawn a thick Arun line over his filthy cheeks
 daadi ne agin ke munh ko chuum-puchkaar kar kaha- ‘‘agin ! mat ro
 i kill Rochan "- and bare one hand, but slammed on the floor moistened with years of fat
 agin kaa "uun uun" ab bhi band na tha; or na band the aansu
 Grandma wiped the tears from her dirty palm, making the Arun row of cheekbones black
 phir rote agin ko bahalane ke liye sookhe chamade ke bheetar jhalkati hui thathriyon ke bich kumhade kii sukhi betia kii bhanti latakate charmamay stanon ko laga diya
 Agin put the breast in her mouth, she stopped crying
 usee samay baahar se baatcheet kii aawaaj aane lagi
 He pulled his face from the dry breast and peered up
 kisi kii mithi sureeli aawaaj ai-"agin"
 Agni cried again
 do janiyon (striyon) ne sir par laade lakdi ke gatthar ko ek kone main pataka
 Then one ran near Rochana and the other near the fire
 agin ne or rote hue "maan-maan" kaha
 Mother, keeping her right hand free, opened the cottonseed white bull's sarom leather over the right breast and placed it down
 jaade kii bhojan-krichhrata ke kaaran uske tarun sharir par maance kam rah gaya tha, to bhi usamen asaadhaaran soundarya tha
 Arun-white image of his red scum-cheeked cheekbones, scattered braided pandu-white hair protecting the frontal, short-fleshy, bluish-round breasts on the chest, crescent-shaped foreskin, athletic medium volume buttress, muscular Bertral Thigh, Shramdhavan-familiar Hallakar Penduli
 us ashtadashi taruni ne agin ko donon haathon main uthaakar uske mukh, aankh or kapol ko choomaa
 Agin had forgotten to cry
 uske laal hothon main se nikal kar safed dentuliyaan chamak rahi thim, uski ankhen ardhamudrit thim, gaalon main chote-chote gadde pade hue the
 Taruni sat down on the Taurus-skin and she gave her soft breasts to Agni's mouth
 agin apane donon haathon se pakade stan ko pine laga
 At the same time, another naked Taruni also sat near with Rochana
 unke chehre ko dekhne se hi pataa lag jaataa tha ki donon bahanen hai
 2
 guha main unhen nibhrit baatcheet karte chhod ham baahar aa dekhte hai
 Many feet covered with leather on the snow are going in one direction
 chalo unhen pakade hue jaldi-jaldi chalem
 Now she reached the forest of the cross-hill slanting
 ham teji se daudte hue badhate ja rahe hai, kintu taaji pad-pankti khatam hone ko nahin aa rahi he
 We sometimes walk in the white ice field, sometimes in the forest itself, crossing the backbone of the hill and the other ice field rises crossing the other forest
 aakhir neeche kii ore se ek vrikshahin pahari kii ridh par hamaari najar padi
 The white snow rising from below is meeting the Nil Nabh, and how many human idols, marking themselves in that Nil Nabh, are disappearing under the cover of the mountain
 unke peeche nila akaash na hota to nishchay hi ham unhen na dekh pate
 There is a white rain-skin like snow on his body
 unke haathon main hathiyaar bhi safed rang se range maaloom hote hai
 Then how can their moving statues in the great white ice field be identified, and take a closer look
 sabase aage supusht sharir kii ek stri he
 Age will be between forty and fifty
 uski khuli dahini bhujaa ko dekhne se hi pataa lagata he ki vah bahut balishtha stri he
 His hair, face and limbs are similar to both the aforementioned fingers of the cavity, but are larger
 uske baayen haath main teen haath lambi bhurj kii moti nokdaar lakdi he
 On the right, there is a stone-pestle fastened by binding with a wooden rope to a leather cane
 uske peeche-peeche chaar mard or do striyaan chal rahi hai
 The age of a man will be slightly more than a woman, the rest are twenty-six to fourteen years old
 bade mard ke kesh bhi vaise hi bade-bade tathaa pandu-shwet hai
 His mouth is covered with thick beard-mustache of the same color
 uskaa sharir bhi stri kii bhanti hi balishtha he; uske haathon main bhi vaise hi do hathiyaar hai
 Of the remaining three men, two are of the same thick beard-mustache, but younger in age
 striyon main ek baees, duusari solah se kam he
 We have seen the faces of the cavity and by joining everyone, it is clear from the grandmother that the appearance of all these men and women is cast in the mold of the grandmother
 in nar-naariyon ke haath ke lakdi, haddi or pathar ke hathiyaaron or unki gambheer cheshtaa se pataa lag rahaa he ki ve kisi muhim par ja rahe hai
 Leading woman descending from the hill - say mother - roamed to the left; All are following him quietly
 barf par chalate vakt chamade se unke banke pairon se jaraa bhi shabd nahin nikal rahaa he
 Now there is a large rock hanging in front (pragara, mountain), with many rocks lying next to it
 shikariyon ne apni gati atyant mand kar di he
 They have become very alert by dispersing
 ve saare pairon ko chirkaar bahut der karke ek pair ke peeche duusare pair ko uthaate, chattaanon ko haath se sparsh karte aage bad rahe hai
 Mother first reached the entrance of the cavity
 vah baahar kii safed barf ko dhyaan se dekhati he, vahaan kisi prakaar kaa pad chihn nahin hai
 Then she enters the cavity alone
 kuch hi haath badhane par guha gum jaati he, vahaan roshni kuch kam he
 After a while she makes her eyes accustomed, then moves on
 vahaan dekhati he teen bhure bhaaluu- maan, baap, baccha- munh neeche kiye dharti par soye, yaa mare pade hai- unamem jivan kaa koi chihn nahin dikh padataa
 Mother returned slowly
 parivaar uske khile chehre ko hi dekhakar bhav samaj gaya
 The mother shows Kani with her thumb, stretching three fingers by pressing the finger
 maan ke baad do mard hathiyaaron ko sanbhaale aage badhate hai, duusare saans roke vahiin khadey pratiksha karte hai
 Mother goes inside and stands near the bear
 bada purush bhaluni ke paas or doosraa bachche ke paas
 Then they hit their pointed poles together with such vigor, that they enter the womb and reach into the heart
 koi hilta-dolata nahin
 The six-month sleep of winter is still more than a month late, but what does mother and family know about it? They have to work only by being cautious
 danda kii nok ko teen-chaar baar or pet main ghusaa ve bhaaluu ko ulat dete hai, phir nirbhay ho unke agle pairon or munh ko pakadakar ghasitate hue unhen baahar laate hai
 Everyone is happy laughing and speaking out loud
 bade bhaaluu ko chit ulatakar maan ne apane chamade kii chadar se ek chakamak pathar kaa chaaku nikaala, phir ghaav kii jagah se milakar pet ke chamade ko cheer diya- pathar ke chaaku se itani safai ke saath chamade kaa chirana abhyast or majboot haathon kaa hi kaam he
 He cut a piece of soft liver into his mouth, the second youngest fourteen year old boy
 baaki sabhi log bhaaluu ke gird baith gayi, maan sabko kaleji kaa tukdaa katkar detii ja rahi thi
 After a bear, when mother put her hand on another bear, Shodashi Taruni went out
 usne barf kaa ek dala munh main daalaa, usee vakt bada purush bhi baahar aa gaya
 He too held a nugget and held Shodashi's hand
 vah jaraa jhijak kar shant ho gai
 The man took her to one side, tied her arm
 shodashi or purush haath main barf kaa bada dala liye jab bhaaluu ke paas laute, tab donon ke gaalon or aankhon main zyada laali thi
 The man said- "I bite, mother! You are tired
" maan ne chaaku ko purush ke haath main de diya
 He bent down and kissed Tarun's face of twenty-four years, then grabbed his hand and went out
 unhone teen bhaaluon kii kaleji ko khaaya
 Where will the fat stay in the four-month-old sleepless bears? Yes, the baby bear's flesh was a little more tender and tasteful, out of which they ate so much
 phir thodi der vishram karne ke liye sabhi paas-paas let gayi
 Now he had to return home
 nar-maadaa bhaaluon ko do-do aadamiyon ne chamade kii rassi se chaaron pairon ko band danda ke sahare kandhe par uthaaya or chote bhaaluu ko ek taruni ne
 Mother was walking ahead in her stone-shadow
 un jangal maanvon ko din ke ghadi-ghante kaa pataa to tha nahin, kintu ve yah jaanate the ki aaj chandani raat rahegi
 After a short walk, the sun seemed to have gone below the horizon, but it did not go into the depths, that is why the evening - the raga remained for hours, and when it was erased, the earth, amber, became ubiquitous everywhere
 abhi ghar-guha dur thi, jabaki khuli jagah main ek jagah maan ekaek khadi ho kaan lagaakar kuch sunne lagi
 Everyone stood silently
 shodashi ne chhbbise tarun ke paas jaakar kaha-"gurr, gurr, vruk, vruk (bhediya)
 Mother also said nodding up and down
 
 
 
 
 
 "grrr, Grrr, Vrk
 bahut vruk, bahut vruk
 "then said in a stirring voice-" Ready "the victim was placed on the ground, and all stood with their arms facing each other, facing each other
 baat kii baat main saat-aath bhediyon ke jhund kii laplapaati jeebhe dikhalaai dene lageen or ve gurraate hue paas aa unke chaaron ore chakkar kaatane lage
 Seeing wooden spears and stone-pelts in the hands of humans, they were hesitating to attack
 isi samay ladke ne- jo ghere ke bich main tha, apane danda main bandhi ek lakdi nikaal kar qamar se bandhi chamade kii patali rassi ko chadha kaman taiyaar kii, phir na jane kahan chipaaye hue tikshn pashaan-fal vaale baan ko nikaal choubise purush ke haath main thama use bheetar kar khud uski jagah aa khadaa ho gaya
 Twenty-four men toughened the Pratincha, then snapped a rifle and hit the wolf in the womb
 bhediya ludhak gaya, kintu phir sanbhal kar jis vakt vah andhadhundh akraman kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, usee vakt us purush ne doosraa baan choda
 This time the wolf had suffered a wound
 use nishchal dekh duusare bhediye uske paas pahunch gayi
 First they licked the hot blood coming out of his body
 phir ve use katkar khaane lage
 Seeing them busy eating, the people then picked up the prey and started running with caution
 abaki baar maan sabase peeche thi, or bich-bich main gum-ghumkar dekhati jaati thi
 Today there was no snow, so their footprints could tell the path well in the moonlight night
 guha aadh mile se kam dur rah gai hogi ki bhediyon kaa jhund phir pahunch gaya
 They handled the weapons by placing the victim on the ground again
 abaki dhanurdhar ne kai baan chalaaye, kintu vah kshan bhar bhi ek jagah na thaharne vaale bhediyon kaa kuch na kar sakaa
 After a very long maneuver, four wolves broke down on a hexadex
 bagal main khadi maan ne apana bhaalaa ek bhediye ke pet main ghusaa jameen par patake diya, kintu baaki teen ne shodashi kii jaangh main chot kar gira diya or baat kii baat main uskaa pet chirakar antadiyaan baahar nikaal deen
 At the time everyone was concentrating on saving Shodashi, at the same time, the other three attacked the empty twenty-four men from behind and tore into the ground without even giving a chance of rescue
 jab tak log udhar dhyaan den, tab tak shodashi ko vah pachis haath dur ghaseet le gayi the
 Mother saw, twenty-four men dying near the half-wolf
 adhamare bhediye ke munh main kisi ne danda daal diya, kisi ne uske agle donon pair pakad liye, phir baaki ne munh lagaakar bhediye ke behate hue garam-garam namakeen khun ko piya, maan ne gale kii naadee katkar unke kaam ko or aasaan bana diya
 All this work was done in a few minutes, people knew that only after finishing the hexade, wolves would attack us
 unhone mritpraaya choubise purush ko vahiin chhod teen bhaaluon or mare bhediye ko uthaa daudna shuru kiya, or ve sahi-salaamat guha main pahunch gayi
 The fire was burning very well, in whose red light all the children and the two girls were sleeping
 daadi ne aahat pate hi kaanpati kintu gambheer aawaaj main kaha- "nisha! aa gai ?” "haan" kahkar maan ne pehle hathiyaaron ko ek ore rakh diya, phir vah chamade kii poshaak khol digambari ban gai
 In the same way, keeping the victim, everyone else removed the leather-dress and allowed the blissful warm touch of fire to spread in Rome ab sara soya parivaar jaag uthaa tha
 
 ek maamuli aahat par jaag jane ke ye log baalpan se hi aadi hote hai
 Mother had taken care of the family till now while spending a lot of care
 hiran, khargosh gaay, bhed, bakrii, ghode ke shikaar jaada shuru hone se pehle hi band ho jate hai, kyonki usee vakt ve dakshin ke garam pradesh kii ore nikal jate hai
 Mother's family should have gone some more south, but Shodashi fell ill at the same time
 us samay ke maanav-dharm ke anusaar parivaar kii swamini maan kaa karttavya tha ki ek ke liye saare parivaar kii jaan ko khatre main na daale
 But, the mother's heart showed weakness
 aaj unhen ek chod, do ko khona padaa
 It is now two months for the victims to return, in the meantime, see how many more have to be given
 teen bhaaluu or ek bhediya main to unka jaada nahin cat saktaa
 The children were very happy, the poor people were lying empty stomach
 maan ne pehle unhen bhediye kii kaleji kaat-kaat kar di
 The boys were eating after all
removed chamade ko bina nuksaan pahunchaae utaara
 Leather is a big work
 maance katkar jab diya jane laga, bahut bhukhon ne to kuch kaccha hi khaaya, phir sabane aag ke angaar par bhun-bhun kar khaanaa shuru kiya
 All of them were cheering mom for cutting one cheek out of their barbecued pieces
 maan ne kaha- "bas, aaj pet bhar khao, kal se itnaa nahin milegaa
 "mother got up and went to one of the corners of the cavity, bringing the puffed membrane from there and said-" This is just honey, drink today, dance, play
 " chhoton ko jhilli se ghut-ghut karke pine ko mila, bado ko zyada zyada
 He got intoxicated
 ankhen laal ho ain
 Then the laughter started
 kisi ne gaanaa gaaya
 The older man started playing wood with wood
 log naachne lage
 Today was a night of joy
 maan kaa rajya tha, kintu vah anyaay or asamanta kaa rajya nahin tha
 Except for the old grandmother and the elder man, all the mothers had children, and the older man and mother were sons and daughters, so there could be no question of mine
 vastutah meraa-tera kaa yug aane main abhi der thi
 But yes, mother had equal and first rights over all men
 apane choubise putr or pati ke chale jane se use afsos na hua ho, yah baat nahin; kintu us samay kaa jivan ateet se adhik vartmaan-vidyaman kii phikr karata tha
 Mother's two husbands were present
 teesraa chaudaa saalaa taiyaar ho rahaa tha
 During the time of his kingdom, not even a single child could reach the status of a husband
 maan chhbbise ko pasand karti thi, isliye baaki teen taruniyon ke liye ek vah pachaasa purush hi bachaa tha
 As the winter passed, Grandma was found sleeping forever one day! Three of the children were taken to the wolves and the older man went into the flow of the river Umdi as the snow melted
 is prakaar parivaar solah kii jagah nau kaa rah gaya
 3
 basant ke din the
 Navajivan was being communicated in nature
 chha: maheene se sookhe bhurj-vrikshon par duse-pattey nikal rahe the
 The snow melted, the earth was being covered with greenery
 hawa main vanaspati or nai mitti kii bheengi-bhagi maadak gandh fail rahi thi
 Lifeless life was becoming alive
 kahin vrikshon par pakshi naanaa-bhanti ke madhur shabd suna rahe the, kahin jhilli anwarat shor machaa rahi thi, kahin him-dravit pravahon ke kinare baithe hajaaron jal-pakshi krimi-bhakshan main lage hue the, kahin kalahans pranay-krida kar rahe the
 Now in these green parvat forests, herds of herds used to be seen grazing by jumping deer, somewhere sheep, goats, some reindeer, somewhere
 or kahin inaki ghaat main lage hue chitah dubak kar baithe hue the, or kahin bhediye
 Man-families, which had stopped at one place like the flow of the river blocked for winter, were now flowing
 They were going into the open spaces with their weapons, their skin and their children carrying home-fire
 din bitne ke saath pashu-vanaspatiyon kii bhanti unke bhi shushk charm ke neeche maance or charbi ke mote str jamate ja rahe the
 Sometimes big dogs with their long hair would catch sheep or goats, sometimes they would kill any animal with a net, arrow or wooden spear
 nadiyon main bhi machhliyaan thim, or is volga ke upree bhaag ke nivaasiyon ke jaal aaj kal kabhi khaali baahar nahin aate the
 It was still cold at night, but the day was hot, and the nisha-parivar (mother's name is Nisha) was lying on the banks of the Volga with many other families nowadays
 nisha kii bhanti hi duusare pariwaron par bhi unki maataaon kaa shashan tha, pita kaa nahin
 It was impossible to tell exactly whose father is there
 nisha ko aath putriyaan or chah putr paidaa hue, jisamen chaar ladkiyaan or teen putr ab bhi uski pachpan varsh kii avasthaa main maujuud hai
 There is no doubt in their being children, because evidence of childbirth exists for this; But it is not possible to tell who their father is
 nisha ke pehle jab uski maan-budhi daadi-kaa rajya tha, tab budhi daadi-us vakt praudha-ke kitne hi bhai pati, kitne hi putr pati the, jinhone kitni hi baar nisha ke saath naachakar, gaakar uske prem kaa paatr banane main safalataa pai thi, phir swayan rani ban jane par nisha kii nirantar badalati premakanksha ko uske bhai yaa sayaane putr thukaraane kii himmat nahin rakhte the
 That is why it is impossible to say who the father is among the seven surviving children of Nisha
 nisha ke parivaar main aaj vahi sabase badi budhi or prabhutaa-shalini bhi he; yadhyapi yah prabhutaa der tak rahane vaali nahin he
 In two or two years, she herself is going to become an old grandmother, and then the most nisha-daughter accounting is going to be the state
 us vakt lekha kii bahanon kaa usase jhagada jarur hoga
 Every year, it is the duty of every queen mother to protect the family from decay, where some family members are to be subjected to floods of wolf or leopard jaws, bear claws, bull horns, Volga
 to bhi aisa hota aayaa he, lekha kii bahanon main se ek yaa do avashya swatantra parivaar kaayam karne main samarth hongi
 This family growth would have stopped only if many Rajas had a semen area like many spheres
 parivaar kii swamini nisha apni putree lekha ko shikaar main bahut safal dekhati he
 She climbs the hills like a harin
 us din ek chattan par, bahut unche aisi jagah ek bada madhuchhatra dikhaai padaa, jahaan rich (madhvad) bhi use kha nahin saktaa tha
 But, Lekha tied the logs on the log, then on the night of the lizard's move, he burnt the honeycomb with a big honey-bee and pierced it with a torch
 neeche ke chamade ke kuppe main tees ser se kam madhu nahin gira hoga
 Not only was this Nisha's family praised for this courage of accounting, but also the neighbor-family
 kintu nisha usase santusht nahin thi
 She was watching, Tarun does not want to listen to her prayer as much as Nisha-son is ready to dance at the behest of the account, though they do not yet have the courage to disobey Nisha openly
 nisha kitne hi dinon se koi rasta soch raheen thi
 Sometimes she would have thought that Lekha should be strangled to death while sleeping, but she also knew that Lekha was more sacrosanct than that; She alone cannot harm him
 yadi vah duusare kii sahaayta lenaa chaahe, to kyon koi uski sahaayta karegaa ? parivaar ke sabhi purush lekha ke pranay-paatr, krupa-paatr bananaa chaahate the
 Nisha's daughters too were not ready to share the mother's hand, they were afraid of accounting
 ve jaanati thim ki asafal hone par lekha buree tarah se unke praan legi
 Nisha was thinking about sitting in solitude
 ekaek, uskaa cheharaa khil uthaa--use lekha kaa parrast karne kii koi yukti sujh padi
 He had climbed all day long
 saare parivaar apane-apane chamade ke tambuon ke peeche nange lete yaa baithe dhoop le rahe the, kintu nisha tamboo ke saamne baithi thi, uske paas lekha kaa teen varsh kaa putr khel rahaa tha
 Nisha had red-red strawberry fruit in her hand
 volga kii dhara paas se bah rahi thi, or nisha ke saamne sidhe khadey araar tak dhaalu jameen thi
 Nisha rolled a fruit
 ladkaa dauda or use pakadakar kha gaya
 Then rolled the other one; She could catch him going a little further
 nisha ne jaldi-jaldi kitne hi fal ludhaka diye; bachche ne unhen pakadaney ke liye itani jaldi kii ki ek baar uskaa pair araar se phisal gaya or vah dhamm se volga kii tej dhar main ja gira
 Nisha ran towards Volga and screamed
 kuch dur par baithi lekha ne dekha
 Seeing the son, he stumbled towards Dhar
 uskaa putr dhar main abhi neeche-upar ho rahaa tha
 He succeeds in capturing the leap and capturing the son
 bahut pani pi jane se baccha shithil ho gaya tha
 Volga's icy water was piercing like a thorn in the body
 lekha ko dhar katkar kinare kii ore badhanaa mushkil tha
 She had a child in one hand, with the other hand and legs, she was trying to swim
 usee vakt apane gale ko usne kisi ke majboot haathon main fasaa dekha
 It did not take long to understand the account now
 vah der se nisha kii badali hui manovriti ko dekh rahi thi
 Today Nisha wants to remove this thorn-account of her path
 lekha ab bhi nisha ko apana bal dikhalaa sakati thi; kintu uske haath main baccha tha
 Nisha placed his chest on her head, seeing Lekha pushing hard
 lekha ek baar dub gai
 His child got out of hand to splash
 ab bhi nisha ne use bekaabu kar rakhaa tha
 Suddenly, his hand fell on Nisha's neck
 lekha behosh thi or nisha uske boj ke saath tairne main asamarth
 He tried something, but wasted! The two met Volga together
 parivaar kii balishtha stri rochana nisha-parivaar kii swamini bani

 yah desh main kisi rajya main ho rahaa is tarah kaa pehla surveykshan he
 Nearly four lakh government employees are engaged in a survey of about one crore families in 10 districts of the state
 telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) ne vipaksh ke un aaropon ko khaarij kiya he, jinamein kaha gaya he ki is kadam kaa lakshya hyderabad main rah rahe andhra pradesh ke logon ko alag-thalag karnaa he
 The government says that through these figures it is identifying those people who should really get the benefit of government schemes
 surveykshan kii shuruyaat subah saat baje rajyabar main hui
 In the house-to-house survey, the beneficiary's name, age, educational qualification, occupation, Aadhaar number, bank account number, property and other family details are being recorded
 yah surveykshan shaam saat baje tak jari rahegaa
 While there are apprehensions that the survey is being conducted to isolate the residents of Andhra Pradesh living in Hyderabad, on the contrary, the survey does not include the beneficiary's residence column
 is prakriya ke liye sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko rajya main chuttee ghoshit kar di he, jisase telugana main saamaanya janajivan prabhavit hua he
 Shops, petrol pumps, hotels, theaters, commercial establishments, companies, factories and educational institutions are closed

 9 saal se satta se bedakhal bijepi ko narendra modi main apana bhavishya dikhataa he
 But the 9-year-old fake encounter case of Ishrat Jahan has come up in front of Modi's future
 haalanki sibiai kii chargeshit main sirf 7 pulisavaalon kaa hi naam he, lekin der-saber isaki aanch narendra modi or unke sabase priy paatr amit shah tak pahunch sakati he
 Questions are also being raised on Modi because at the time when Ishrat Jahan's encounter took place, Gujarat's home ministry was also with Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 jabaki grih rajya mantri unke sabase bharosemand sahyogi amit shah the, jinhen modi ne in dinon bijepi kaa uttar pradesh prabharee banavaa rakhaa he
 Now the question is whether the government did not have any inkling about such a serious matter of its own policemen
 or agar nahin thi to maamle kii shuru main hi nishpaksh jaanch karaane kii koshish kyon nahin hui
 No one has the answer
 modi par sawaal is liye bhi uth rahe hai ki sibiai kaa daawa he ki modi or amit shah kii jaankaree kaa saboot he
 The CBI is trying to prove that the encounter was fake and the information was already known to Chief Minister Narendra Modi and his close aide Amit Shah
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki unke paas police ke kuch aise gavaah bhi hai jinke paas wo recording he jisamen diaiji vanjaaraa ne ibi adhikari rajendra kumaar ko ishaaron main bataaya tha ki modi or amit shah ko muthbhed kii puri jaankaree he
 But BJP is saying that Modi is immaculate, undeserving Congress is playing dirty game
 modi 2014 ke liye deshvyapee abhiyaan par nikal pade hai
 Taking the image of his made-up development man
 lekin ishrat jahaan cond modi kii chhavi par pehle se lage daag ko or gaharaa kar saktaa he
 Political ruckus has started: Political ruckus has started on the cbi's charge sheet on the incident encounter
 ishrat ke encounter ko farji bataane par congress ne narendra modi ko gher linna he to bijepi ne bhi congress par jabardast palatwaar kiya he
 When the CBI called Ishrat Jahan encounter fake, the Congress attacked the Gujarat government
 gujarat ke siem narendra modi kaa naam naa hone ke baavjood modi par congressi hamalaa tej tha
 On the other hand, the BJP did not delay in retaliating
 bijepi ke nishane par thi centre sarkaar
 The CBI chargesheet also gave JDU an opportunity to attack Modi
 left bhi peeche nahin rahi
 It is clear that the political war has started on the CBI charge sheet

 com / zfpu3fn3h4 Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (MS Dhoni), who is under criticism due to his batting at the moment, can also make a big achievement
 dhoni ne ab tak vanade international main bharat kii ore se khelte hue 9949 ran banaae hai or unhen team india kii ore se khelte hue vanade main 10,000 ran puure karne ke liye 51 ran kii darkaar he
 Significantly, Mahi scored 174 runs in three matches against Africa XI, playing for Asia XI in 2007, which made him join the 'dus Hazari' club during the recently concluded Asia Cup but for India They still need 51 runs to complete 10,000 runs in odis
 openar yani shikhar dhawan (shikhar Dhawan) yani 'jatji' ke paas bhi is match main vanade cricket main paanch hazaar ran puure karne kaa mauka hoga
 Shikhar Dhawan currently holds 48 in 111 matches
 27 kii ausat se 4827 ran bana hai
 Dhawan now needs 173 runs to complete five thousand runs in ODI cricket
 dhawan guwahati main hue vanade main flop rahe the lekin asia cap main balle se jabardast pradarshan karte hue ve main of da toornament rahe the
 This left-handed opener may not reach this record in the Visakhapatnam ODI but it will probably achieve this feat in the five-match ODI series

 jis umr main bacchon ke haathon main khilone or kitaaben honi chahien, us umr main agar koi unheen haathon main maut kaa saamaan thama de, to ise aap kya kahenge? aaj vaardaat main baat aise masuumon kii, jo al kaayda kii aatank factory main goli-bandook se khelnaa sikh rahe hai
 Al Qaeda has released the video of its factory, the world is in a hurry
 ye tasviren chaunkaati hai, rongte khadey karti hai
 These pictures make me think
 kyonki ye koi jang kaa maidan nahin, balki duniya ke sabase khatarnaak aatanvaadi sanghathan al-qaayada kii factory kii sabase taaja tasviir he
 This picture is of the factory in which jihadi and human bombs are made, but this time the video released by this factory for its branding is two steps ahead of all the pictures so far
 kyonki is video main aise chote-chote or maasoom bacchon ko khataranaak hathiyaaron kii tranning lete hue dikhaaya gaya he, jinhen duniyaadaari kii samaj to dur, abhi thik se apane kadamon par chalanaa tak nahin aata
 It is the lonely hideout on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there is a lot of silence and this silence breaks only when the fire in this factory of terror fires
 itnaa to saaf he ki alqaida ne in bacchon kaa jihad ke naam par brinwash kiya he
 But who are these children after all? Who are their parents? Where do they come from? And what is the purpose of giving them such dangerous weapons at such a young age? The answers to these questions are surprising
 jehad ke naam par insaan kis kadar pagal ho saktaa he, al-kaayda kaa ye letest video is baat kaa sabase bada subut he
 In this al-qaeda terror factory, they are learning the tricks of firing from innocent automatic pistols
 jis bachche ko dikhaaya gaya he vah abhi behad chota he
 Age will be only 5 years
 or isi choti umr main uske haath main maut kaa ye saamaan kisi ko sakate main daalane ke liye kaafii he
 When that child first fires and the trigger is shaken with the pistol shock
 pehla jatke par to wo kisi tarah sanbhal jaataa he, lekin firing ke duusare jatke se uskaa bhi balance bighad jaataa he
 Not just one, many children have been shown to learn to use such dangerous weapons
 pakistan or afghanistan ke border par al-kaayda ke ek gumnaam thikaane main khud aatankwaadiyon ne hi is video ko shoot kiya he
 But the most shocking truth of this factory of terror is that almost all of them are innocent orphans who were poured into the face of death
 faujee or police kii karrwai main maare gaye aatankiyon kii in auladon ko al-kaayda ne phir se usee raste par laa diya he, jis par chal kar unke pitaaon ko maut mili thi
 Obviously, humans and humanity have no place in this factory of terror

 Warne was a commentator in the australia-pakistan Sydney Test in January, which has been overshadowed by fixing

 When an office colleague flirts with you, do not live in the happiness that you are the most beautiful woman in the office
 iske vipareet aise purush sahakarmiyon se saavdhaan rahen kyonki ek shodh kahata he ki ve apni boriyat bhagane ke liye karyaalay main flert karte hai or nijee jivan main asantusht rahete hai
 Researchers at the University of Surrey surveyed more than two hundred women and men aged between 21 and 68 years and asked them if they flirted in the office
 shodh main yah chaunkaane vaali baat saamne aayi ki aise purush jivan, rojgaar main kam santusht hote hai
 Participants in the research included lawyers, stockbrokers, charity workers and bureaucrats
 unase unke vyaktitv , naukari tathaa karyaalay main mehnat se kiye jane vaale kaam ko lekar sawaal kiye gaye
 The results of this research showed a clear distinction between women and men
 flert karne vaali mahilaayein bhi apni naukari se utani hi santusht thim jitani ve mahilaayein jo karyaalay main puri tarah kade peshevraana sambandh rakhti thim
 But in contrast flirting men were not satisfied with their employment, personality etc
 shodhakarta chadi musa ne kaha, ‘pichley shodhon main yah dikhaaya gaya tha ki log vibhinn kaarnon se flert karte hai jinamein aatm gaurav ko badhanaa, majaa karnaa or romance karnaa shaamil tha
 "he said," If men feel dissatisfied with their role, they flirt to keep themselves happy and that is a negative definition of relationships
 ’unhone kaha, ‘flert karne ke phaayde ho sakate hai lekin karyaalay main jarurat se adhik flert is baat kaa sanket he ki aap apni naukari se asantusht hai or boriyat kaa shikaar hai
 ' congress or jedies vidhayakon ke istife se shuru hua karnataka kaa siyaasi naatak abhi khatm nahin hua he
 After the resignation of 13 Congress and 3 JDS mlas, the Congress and JDS coalition government has come down from the figure of 113 required for a majority
 vidhansabha adhyaksh kii ore se istife par faisla lene main ho rahi der ke chalate philhal yah maamla supreme court main pahunch gaya he
 The Supreme Court asked the Speaker to maintain the status quo until the next hearing on 16 July and no action should be taken till then
 jedies netaa or mukhyamantri kumaraswami or congress netaa siddharmaiya vishwaas jataa rahe hai ki ab bhi bahumat unke paksh main he
 However, the BJP has been suspicious that the coalition government does not have a substantial majority in the House
 agar 16 vidhayakon ke istife vidhansabha adhyaksh sweekaar kar lete hai to karnataka kii gathbandhan sarkaar gir jaaegi
 In such a situation Kumaraswamy may have to resign from the post of CM
 agar koi party apana bahumat siddh nahin kar paati he or naye sire se chunaav honge
 According to the mandate data of 2019 Lok Sabha elections, which party will win in the event of re-election? India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed the data of the last Lok Sabha election and found that the BJP got the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 If you change the seats in the assembly, the BJP has an edge over 171 seats in Karnataka
 karnataka kaa number gemekarnataka vidhansabha main kul 224 siten hai
 In the last assembly election, BJP became the largest party in the assembly
 uske paas 105 vidhayak hai jo ki bahumat se 8 kam hai
 Congress won 79 seats and JDS 37 seats
 donon partiyon ne gathbandhan karke bahumat hasil kar liya or bijepi ko satta se baahar kar diya
 However, after the resignation of 16 mlas of the ruling party, the mathematics of majority has changed again
 aankadon se aisa lag rahaa he ki sarkaar girane ke baad nae sire se chunaav hote hai to bhagava party satta main laut sakati he
 If the results of the Lok Sabha election 2019 were converted into assembly seats, the statistics say that BJP got an edge over 171 out of 224 seats, while the Congress and JDS alliance was ahead in only 47 seats
 mandya loksabhaa seat ke tahat aane vaali chah vidhansabha siton par nirdaleey pratyaashee sumalata ambarish ko badhat mili jinhone siem kumaraswami ke bete nikhil kumaraswami ko haraaya tha
 Comparing the results of the 2018 assembly elections in Karnataka and the Lok Sabha elections held in 2019, the alliance lost 69 seats in the Lok Sabha
 aankadon se pataa chalata he ki gathbandhan ko uttar-pashchimi karnataka main bada nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he
 Even in the southern regions of Karnataka where the coalition parties did better during the assembly elections, the BJP has made a dent
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan mandya seat par bijepi ne apana pratyaashee khadaa na karke ambarish ko samarthan diya tha
 The BJP was the largest party in the Karnataka assembly elections, but could not get a majority
 lekin ek saal baad hi loksabhaa chunaav hue or matadaataaon kaa mizaaj badal gaya
