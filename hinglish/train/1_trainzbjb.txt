 dilli main pichley kuch dinon se waite kamishnar ke mudde par centre sarkaar banaam dilli sarkaar kii jang ko ab viraam lag gaya he
 LG Najeeb Jung has appointed IAS officer SS Yadav as the new VAT Commissioner of Delhi
 yadav abhi dilli jal board ke siio the or kejariwal ke behad khaas maane jate hai
 In fact, a few days ago, the transfer of VAT commissioner IAS officer Vijay Kumar was removed from Delhi, after which the Kejriwal government accused the LG and the central government of working under pressure from the influential traders lobby and hawala traders
 yahi nahin jab kejariwal sarkaar ne nae waite kamishnar ke liye iees afasar ankur garg kaa naam aage badhaayaa to alji ne ye kah kar thukraa diya ki is pad ke liye ye bahut junior hai
 After this, the Kejriwal government passed the cabinet proposal and said that if LG can meet the VAT collection target of 24000 crore, then keep the VAT department with you
 iske baad alji ne press jari karke safai di ki unhone kisi kaa koi transafar nahin kiya he
 The order of the Ministry of Home Affairs was that officers who had been transferred months ago should be relieved
 or, kyonki sarkaar grih mantralay ke aadesh nahin maan rahi thi isliye un afasaron ko relive karne ke liye grih mantralay ko alji daftar ko nirdesh dena padaa jiske alji daftar ne aadesh jari kiya
 The comments asal main dilli sarkaar kii kul kamai kaa 70 fisadi waite se aata he yani chunaav main jo bhi vaade kejariwal ne dilli kii janata se kiye the uske liye mukhyatah paisa waite se hi aana he
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party government has decided to increase the VAT collection target from 17 thousand crores to 24 thousand crores
 aise main is department se zaraa bhi chhedchhad usko bardaasht nahin
 Overall, the appointment of Kejriwal's special and favorite officer SS Yadav as the VAT commissioner is to be believed that at least this front was carried out by Kejriwal, who is holding onto the department
 asal main kuch dinon pehle waite kamishnar iees afasar vijay kumaar kaa transafar dilli se baahar kar diya gaya tha jiske baad kejariwal sarkaar ne alji or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf rasukhdaar tryder lobby or hawala kaarobaariyon ke dabaav main kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Not only this, when the Kejriwal government put forward the name of IAS officer Ankur Garg for the new VAT commissioner, the LG turned down saying that he is too junior for this post
 iske baad kejariwal sarkaar ne cabinet prastaav paas karke kaha ki agar alji 24000 karod ke waite collection ke lakshya ko puraa kar sakate hai to waite vibhaag apane paas hi rakh len
 After this, LG issued a press clarification that they did not transfer any
 grih mantralay kaa aadesh tha ki jo afasar maheenon pehle transafar ho chuke hai, unako relive kiya jaae
 And, because the government was not accepting the orders of the Home Ministry, the Home Ministry had to direct the LG office to release the officers whose LG office issued the order
 tippaniyan Actually 70 percent of the total revenue of the Delhi government comes from VAT i
e
 for whatever promises Kejriwal made to the people of Delhi in the election, the money is mainly to come from VAT
 isliye aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne waite collection kaa lakshya 17 hazaar karod se badhaakar 24 hazaar karod karne kaa faisla kiya he 
 In such a situation, it is not tolerable to tamper with this department
 kul milakar kejariwal ke khaas or pasandida maane jane vaale afasar es es yadav kii waite kamishnar ke taur par niyukti se mana jaae ki kam se kam ye morcha to kejariwal ne fateh kiya jisase department par u kii pakad barqaraar he

 Asked about the repeat question raised by the Supreme Court in the a Raja case by reporters, party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said, "I don't know what the court has said
" 
 Is it comment, instruction or order
 
 It is not appropriate to say anything until you see the details
 ’ unhone kaha ki jo kuch bhi kaha gaya he uski pehle party or sarkaar samiksha karegi or uske baad tay karegi ki kya jawaab dena he
 It is difficult to comment until the full details of what the court has said are seen
 party ne sanchaar mantri e raja dwaara apane istife ke liye diye gayi tarkon kaa bhi samarthan kiya ore kaha ki raja ne khud kaha he ki unhone apane party netaa se baat karne ke baad apane vivek se istipha dene kaa faisla kiya he or saath hi kaha ki unhone sansadeey loktantr ke sugamawa se kaamkaaj ke liye aisa kiya he
 We see no reason to disagree with his comment
 ahamed ne saaf taur par kaha ki na na to unki party or na na hi sarkaar tuji maamle kii sanyukt sansadeey samiti se jaanch karaane ke paksh main he
 He, however, deferred answering questions asked on the cag's comments against Raja

 ) congress netaa jairam ramesh aam aadmi party kii safalataa ke khaase prabhavit najar aa rahe hai
 Jairam Ramesh has said that had the Lokpal Bill been passed two years ago, the Aam Aadmi Party would not have emerged
 ramesh ne saath hi raajnneetik varg ko chetavanee di he ki aam aadmi party kaa majaak nahin banaaen
 However, the Congress party has shied away from his statement
 jairam ramesh yaheen nahin ruke
 He told the political class that he should not make fun of the Aam Aadmi Party and warned that this new party can take different incarnations in the states on legitimate issues
 congress netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki desh main communist hi aise raajnneetik samooh hai jo bhavy jeevanstyli or dhan ke khule pradarshan kii beemaari se mukt hai
 He said, 'we cannot ignore the Aam Aadmi Party as they are agitating for corruption, austerity in politics, simplicity in politics, then there are issues with fair values
 'gramin vikaas mantri ramesh ne kaha, aaj congress party AAP ke bare main soch rahi he, lekin bijepi to aam aadmi party ke kaaran pehle hi apni neend gavaan chuki he
 Prakash Karat is saying that we are Aam Aadmi Party
 punjab main agar badal apane raste nahin sudhaarte hai to aam aadmi party akali dal ko bhi kha jaaegi
 AAP is Dashavatar
 alag-alag rajyon main yah party alag avatar le sakati he
 On the other hand, the Congress has distanced itself from Ramesh's statement on AAP

 ' buudhvaar ko deepak dhawalikar ne kaha mere bayaan ko media ne galat tareeke se pesh kiya, meraa makasad kisi dharm ko chot pahunchaana nahin tha, aap balaatkaar ko shiksha se nahin jod sakate, unhone hamaari chhavi karaab karne ke liye sab ghalmail kar diya
 Deepak Dhavalikar is a minister from the quota of bjp's ally Maharashtra Gomantak Party in Goa, a few days before his wife Lata Dhavalikar held a program at the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti blaming Western civilization for the increasing cases of rape, saying that women should give their children Do not send in convent schools, but teach in schools that promote Hindu culture
 ek din baad deepak dhawalikar ne apni patni kaa saath dete kaha ki unhen kabhi chhedchhad kaa shikaar nahin hona padaa, kyonki taumr unhone sari pahani he, lekin buudhvaar ko dhawalikar apane bayaan se palat gaye or kaha desh main jo jaisaa chaahe pahanane ke liye swatantra he
 But the Goa Congress seems to be politicized in these statements, it feels that MGP wants to snatch the bjp's fiery Hindutva agenda from these statements, Durgadas Kamat, Goa Congress Secretary, said in a conversation with NDTV
 Strange is immature, but if you think politically, it is the thinking of Maharashtra Gomantak Party to garner bjp's votes

 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main mili shikast ke baad donon dalon ne ek baar phir saath aane kaa faisla kiya he
 The past shows that both parties have come together in the same situation as in 1992, even today
 ayodhya main babari masjid vidhwans or bhartiya janata party ke badhate graph ko dekhte hue basapa-sapa 1992 main ek saath aae or donon dalon ne milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 During that time the two parties held several joint rallies in which Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh Yadav shared the stage
 in reliyon main kanshiram bijepi ke saath saath congress par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa karte the
 At times he has not even criticized former Prime Minister VP Singh
 unka maananaa tha ki veepi singh ke pradhanmantri rahane ke dauraan hi bhaajapa kii hindutvaadi raajnneeti ko badhaava mila
 In fact, in 1993, the SP and the BSP formed a government in Uttar Pradesh
 sapa-basapa ke saath aane kii prishthbhumi babari masjid vidhwans kii ghatana ke baad bani
 After the incident of 6 December 1992, Mulayam Singh Yadav reached BSP office in Delhi on 8 December 1992
 yaheen kanshiram or mulaayam singh yadav ne gathbandhan banane kaa faisla kiya
 The two parties held a joint rally on 14 December 1992 at the Christian College Ground in Mainpuri and the process continued

 In the same sequence, their alliance was claimed to be permanent at a huge Chetna rally jointly organized by both parties in Varanasi and Faizabad on 28-29 March 1993 respectively
 in reliyon main uttar pradesh ke vibhinn jilon se donon dalon ke kaaryakartaaon ne bade paimaane par hissaa liya
 At the rally in Beniabagh in Varanasi, the then BSP President Kanshi Ram addressed and termed the alliance as permanent
 is raily main kanshiram ne kaha ki desh main vyapak parivartan kii shuruyaat uttar pradesh se hogi
 There is no better leader than Mulayam Singh to fight this change
 pichley chunaav main bhi hamane unka niyaswaarth samarthan kiya tha
 Our main goal is to connect people who are broken up on the basis of caste
 barabari kii saamaajik, aarthik vyavastha banani he or jindagi ke har kshetra main barabari laana he
 For this, we have chosen the support of the Samajwadi Party
 is raily ko mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi sambodhit kiya
 Similarly, at the joint Chetna rally held in Faizabad, Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh expressed different views on the question of the opposition Ekta than the BJP

 un dinon yah naaraa bahut prasiddh hua or jan jan kii jubaan par chadha hua tha
 However, describing journalists as enemies for Bahujan society, Kanshi Ram said, "political change is more important than social change
" samaajawaadee party parivartan kii disha main sangharshrat he
 The BSP has compromised with the SP by looking at this vision
 basapa-sapa kaa yah gathbandhan tikaoo rahegaa
 'kanshi Ram also said that,' However, our party is against coordination with anyone, because our fight is not only with power but with change of system and humanism

 At the closed-door meeting of Dalit workers of BJP on October 28, before the third phase of the Bihar Assembly elections, a worker informed party president Amit Shah about the important issue which was being discussed openly
 usne kaha ki aarakshan par mohan bhagwat ke bayaan se bijepi ko “jhatka” lag rahaa he
 Once upon a time Shah became shocked, then normal
 aisa laga ki kamare main maujuud sabhi kaaryakarta is par charchaa ke liye pehle se taiyaar baithe the
 All of them were questioning the understanding of the Sarsanghchalak, who spoke about the review of reservation, while it is common that large sections of the state, besides the Dalits, have been the beneficiaries of the reservation
 shah or unki team ne ghabrahat main ek vaikalpik tarika nikaalane kii koshish kii jiskaa nateeja pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashanon main saaf dikhaa jab unhone har keemat par aarakshan kii raksha karne kaa elaan kiya
 Before this strategy could work, one-third of the state's 243 assembly seats, ie 81 seats had been voted
 ab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 On the other hand, the Mahagathbandhan spread fear among the overwhelmingly backward and Dalit sections of the state that the BJP plans to take away the benefits of reservation from them and thus exploited the reservation dispute as much as possible in its election campaign
 loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke sahyogi rahe or ab mahagathbandhan ke chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor tathaa unki team ne bina deree kiye bhagwat ke kahe ko 20 lakh se zyada sandeshon ke madhyam se whotsap par jhonk diya
 Apart from this, there was a flood of messages on Facebook and other social media forums
 rajya main rajya ke 6 karod mobile phone hai, jinaki sankhya rajya ke matadaataaon kii sankhya ke baraabar he
 The Grand Alliance also conducted millions of papers with it
 argedy ke ek netaa kehete hai, “jahaan-jahaan lalu prasad sabhaaon ko sambodhit karne gaye, hamane aise saikadon parache logon ke bich baant die jin par bhagwat kii tippanee likhi hui thi
 We hoped this would have the opposite effect for the BJP

 He had no idea how things worked in Bihar
 ve isaki bajaae maamuli baton ko lekar prachaar karte rahe ki kaise lalu, nitish or rahul gandhi ek manch par nahin aa rahe hai
 Shah and his team were so confident in the massive victory they got in the Lok Sabha elections last summer that they could not catch the fact that the game was now slipping out of their hands
 jaldbaaji main ranneeti main jo badlaav kiye gaye, masalan modi pichde jati se hai vagairah nuksaan kii bharpai kar paane main naakaam rahe
 Although local leaders may have had an idea of what is going to happen on November 8, the day of the verdict, a day before that, a big leader of the Bihar BJP, in frustration, called Bhagwat's comment "such a goal in his own court" "which was impossible to reverse
 dharmik muddon ko oochaalnamatadaan ke chauthe charan 1 november ke pehle prachaar ke dauraan shah kii bechaini ko saaf dekha ja saktaa tha
 Not only Shah but Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a communal color to the bjp's campaign in the hope that perhaps they will be able to repeat the leaks of Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh
 isiilie 26 aktubar ko baxur main jab modi ne nitish par pichhadi jatiyon se kota chin kar “ek vishesh samudaay” ko die jane kaa aarope lagaaya, to raily main maujuud jansamooh samet kisi ko bhi is baat kaa ranchamaatr shaq nahin tha ki unka ishaara musalamaanon kii ore he
 Shah also played a communal card while addressing a rally on 30 October at Raxaul on the bihar-nepal border
 unhone logon ko yah chetavanee de daali ki bijepi agar chunaav haar gai to “pakistan main pataakhe phode jaaenge
 This statement, which came under the constant campaign of saffron organizations, not only made 17 percent Muslim vote bank firmly with the grand alliance but it also angered many other sections as to why BJP is trying to polarize the atmosphere
 is
 bijepi ke purv netaa or atal bihari vaajapeyi kii cabinet main mantri rahe arun shouri kehete hai ki yah ranneeti puraani pad chuki thi

 ”nakli roshamatganana shuru hone ke do ghante baad deshbhar ke aresas or bijepi kaaryakartaaon ke paas rajasthan ke ek sangh padaadhikari kii ore se esemes aata he
 It cites the "lessons" taken from Bihar's mandate for Modi and Shah, that "politics is a team action", "cannot be won on the strength of the captain alone" and also that "the public is a dummy leader Do not like ” ho saktaa he ki aane vaale dinon main yah bhaavana or gahari ho jaae, lekin sangh parivaar ke bheetar vibhinn logon kaa maananaa he ki shah ke netritv main rachaa gaya chunaav prachaar anaavashyak rup se aakraamak tha or modi lagaataar nitish ko nishaanaa banaate rahe jiske chalate jedy(you) or uske pramukh ke prati sahanubhuti main ijapha hua
 Modi's question about Nitish's Bihari DNA also backfired
 prashanth kishor ne use apane prachaar abhiyaan kaa hissaa bana daalaa
 Thousands of Biharis were asked to send a sample of their hair and nails to the Prime Minister's Office in Delhi
 har bhejne vaale ne modi se apana diene janchvaane kaa aagrah kiya
 Also, by calling Bihar a "sick state", Modi loses any opportunity to say that the development in Bihar was actually due to his predecessor alliance with the JD (U), which should be credited to the BJP
 bijepi kii sthiti tab or bighad gai jab lalu ne bif ko chunaav prachaar kaa hissaa bana daalaa or dadri main ek musalmaan kii kathith taur par gomance khaane ke naam par saream petakar hui hatya par modi kii chuppi ko kathghare main khadaa kar diya
 The last nail in the bjp's coffin was hit on November 4, a day before the final phase of voting when the Election Commission banned the bjp's advertisements in which the party questioned Nitish's silence regarding cows being slaughtered
 It was raised that this would allow polarization of Hindu voters against the Grand Alliance
 modi-shah kii team jaise-jaise ye galtiyaan karti gai, prashanth kishor or unki team vaise-vaise har ek masale ko naatakeey mode dekar mahagathbandhan ke phaayde main bhunaati gai
 Prashant Kishore, after playing with the DNA comment, made Modi's remarks on Lalu's daughter Misa, who called Misa a "poor daughter" at a rally in Patna on October 25 (amid Modi's wave in the Lok Sabha elections With reference to the defeat of Misa)
 prashanth kishor ne jo sandesh prasaarit kiya vah bilkul spasht thah modi mahila virdohi hai
 After this, when the Prime Minister and other leaders started to make a jangle of Jangraj, which was incidentally Nitish's coined word about Lalu's rule, when both of them used to be anti-political & RJD chief had a ready answer to this
 , We will bring back Mandalraj
 ”is haar ke baad bihar bijepi ke kai netaa nijee baatcheet main is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki chunaav prachaar ke aupchaarik rup se shuru hone se kaaphi pehle hi modi ne bihari asmita ko chot pahunchaa di thi
 He cites a rally in Patna on August 18 where Modi, like a king, paid a quarter of a million rupees
 ke aarthik package kaa elaan is tarah kiya tha goyaa ve apni praja ko khayraat baant rahe hon
 When BJP started its election campaign in Bihar, it had 8
 58 fisadi voton kii pehle se kami thi
 NDA may have got 31 out of 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar in 2014, but it got 36 in total
 48 fisadi vot (bijepi 29
 86, LJP 6
 5 or araspi 0
 12 per cent) RJD, JD (U) and Congress jointly got 45
 06 fisadi voton se kam hi the
 The difference in the wrong mathematic share was quite high, but the BJP, which was on the cusp of its success in the Lok Sabha elections, continued to believe that Lalu and Nitish would never work together due to their bitter past and internal contradictions
 uske aashcharya kii seemaa na rahi jab donon netaaon ne puri sahajata se siton kaa na sirf paraspar bantwaaraa kar liya balki pichhali vidhansabha main sirf chaar siten rakhane vaali congress ko bhi 40 siten de deen
 In contrast, the distribution of tickets in the BJP camp was not smooth

 chunaav nateezon ke ek din baad 9 november ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne sweekaar kiya ki bijepi chunavi ganit main chook gai
 After the BJP Parliamentary Board meeting to discuss the electoral debacle, Jaitley said, "I believe that the main reason (of the NDA debacle) is that when the three important parties come together, they can improve their math facilities lets see
 hamane sochaa tha ki loksabhaa chunaav kii tarj par vikaas kaa agenda or pradhanmantri modi kaa prabhaav is ganit par baari pad jayega or nai chemistry ko paidaa karegaa, jabaki aisa nahin hua
 Jaitley also admitted that the BJP had also grossly underestimated the ability of its three allies to get the candidates of the coalition candidates from their caste-based supporters in their respective regions
 unhone kaha, “pradhanmantri kii reliyon main baari bheed jutati thi lekin party ke kuch netaaon ke die bayanon ne hamen vikaas ke apane mukhya mudde se bhatka diya or hamaara sandesh sahi sandarbh main logon tak nahin pahunch paaya
 "the real matter is that from the time of ticket distribution, the party was not dependent on development alone

 oonchi jatiyon ko golband karne kaa jimmaa bijepi ne apane paas rakhaa jabaki pichhadi, ati pichhadi jatiyon or daliton ke vot ke maamle main vah paswan, maanjhi or kushvaha par nirbhar thi
 They not only failed to overcome this task, but also the attempt to add youth to the Yadavas failed
 iskaa or nakaaratmak prachaar kaa khamiyaja yah hua ki kuch bijepi samarthakon ke vot bhi bikhar gaye or oonchi jatiyon ke dabadabe vaale kshetra bhi nikal gaye
 Bihari vs outsider This may sound strange, but the BJP has also lost its trust in Modi as an evangelist
 iskaa sidhaa-sa matlab sthaneey netaaon ko darkinar kar dena tha
 Shatrughan Sinha has raised this issue openly and many people are now talking about it
 modi ke paas shaayad bechney ke liye bahut sapane or ummiden nahin thim

 Lalu, Nitish and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi reminded the public in every meeting that Modi has failed to generate employment, real development for the people and bring back black money, which has led to the loss of 15 lakhs to every person in the country
 Rupee
 daalane kaa vaada kiya gaya tha
 Says a young JD (U) activist, “modi served stale food this time
 ” yahi nahin, modi bijli, sadak, pani kii baat jab reliyon main karte the to log samaj nahin pate the ki kisi pratikriya di jaae
 The truth is that under Nitish's rule in Bihar, the condition of roads, electricity has improved
 yani modi kii ye baaten bhi logon ko bharose ke kaabil nahin lagati thim
 Modi was the face of bjp's election campaign and his soul was Shah

 As the election campaign progressed, the presence of these "outsiders" started to irritate the hearts of state and district level BJP leaders
 party ke ek sthaneey netaa kehete hai, “unase bihar kii jatil jatigat raajnneeti ko samajhane kii kaise ummid kii ja sakati thi?” baad main postaron main sthaneey netaaon ko jagah di gai par tab tak der ho chuki thi
 Major leaders of the state also came to know the decisions only when they were given "information" to implement them by outside leaders

 The former Union Minister said that BJP has now divided into two factions, one which is genuine and the other which is fake and unfortunately the party is now in the hands of fake

 The slums of Delhi are very sensitive to fire due to rising heat
 is maheene jhuggiyon main hue agnicandon ke kaaran paanch logon kii maut ho gai he, jabaki 50 ghayal ho gaye
 Fire crews believe that a number of measures can be taken to prevent such incidents, including banning commercial activities in slums and power supply from underground wires
 adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki jhuggiyon ko banane main upyog kiye jane vaale tatwon, jvalansheel vyarth padaatharen ko surakshit rakhane or jhuggiyon ke bich se bijli ke taron ke jane se in ilaakon main aag lagane kii ghatnaayen badhati ja rahi hai
 Apart from this, the incidence of fire is also increasing due to lack of telecommunication facilities to inform the fire brigade and narrow paths to reach the slums
 dilli agnishman seva ke nideshak aarasi sharma ne kaha ‘‘jhuggiyon main aag mukhya taur par atyadhik garmi ke kaaran lag rahi he
 This heat makes the material used in the construction of slums more flammable, causing a short circuit
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘jhuggiyaan jis padaarth se banatin hai, vah aag pakadaney par jahrili gas paidaa karata he
 "one person was killed and two were injured in two incidents of fire in the capital yesterday
" shalimaar baag kii chaay kii ek dukaan main pichley mangalvaar ko lagi aag main 30 log ghayal ho gaye the
 On the same day, a fire in Shaheen Bagh engulfed 175 slums

 In this episode, now the bjp's original vote bank is desperate to make a place in the heart of the Yadav community
 jabaki duusari taraf akhilesh yadav or shivpal yadav ke bich siyaasi talavaarein khinch chuki hai
 In such a situation, BJP is going to hold 'yadav Conference' on 15 September in Kolkata
 yadav mahasabha apane sadasyon ko bijepi ke is sammelan main jane se nahin rokegi
 The Yadav community has the largest number of OBC community in Uttar Pradesh
 soobe main kareeb 8 fisadi yadav matadaata hai or pichhadi jati main lagbhag 20 fisadi hissedari he
 For the last three decades, UP Yadav has been strongly associated with the voter SP
 bijepi ne yadav samudaay se aane vaale apane party kaaryakartaaon or padaadhikariyon ko is sammelan main shaamil hone ke liye khaastaur par kaha he
 Yadav caste workers from booth level to state level have been entrusted to attend maximum Lucknow conference
 yadav mahasabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh udai pratap singh yadav ne kaha ki hamaare sanghathan main sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke log shaamil hai
 In such a situation, we will not stop the Yadav community from going to this program
 unhone kaha ki upi main yadav matadaata sapa ke saath hai to bihar main argedy ke saath hai, lekin baaki rajyon main ve duusare dalon ko vot karte hai
 In such a situation, BJP is also trying
 haalanki udai pratap sapa se jude hue hai
 Akhilesh Yadav made him the president of Uttar Pradesh Hindi Sansthan in his government
 itnaa hi nahin mulaayam singh yadav ke guru bhi hai, isi kaa nateeja he ki sapa ne unhen 2002 main rajyasabha bhi bheja tha
 Now, in UP, the SP is struggling to preserve its political existence
 aise main bijepi kaa ye sammelan kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Anurag Yadav, who was associated with the Yadav Mahasabha, said that the BJP is holding a Yadav conference in terms of the changed equation of UP, but it is difficult to say that it will succeed in it
 haalanki bijepi ne haal ke dinon main yadav samudaay ke kai netaaon ko aage badhaayaa he
 He said that Shivpal Yadav has separated from Akhilesh Yadav and formed a socialist secular front
 aise main sapa se jo log naaraaz or said line chal rahe the unke liye majboot thikaana hoga
 The Yadav community is divided into two factions
 ek tabaka wo he jo yuva he or ghar-parivaar se sampann he, use saamaajik nyaay or yadav hiton se koi lenaa nahin he
 He is with Akhilesh Yadav
 jabaki doosraa tabaka wo he jo yadav samaaj or saamaajik nyaay ke sangharsh ko dekha he
 They are all with Shivpal
 anuraag kehete hai ki akhilesh or shivpal ke bich bada vaicharik antar he
 Akhilesh Yadav celebrates the birth anniversary of Parashuram, but does not celebrate the birth anniversary of BP Mandal
 aarakshan ke mudde par sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe hai, lekin akhilash khamosh hai
 While Shivpal is vocal on all these issues
 aise main shivpal aane vaale samay main badi dikkat paidaa kar sakate hai
 So much will depend on the strategy ahead of Shivpal
 lakhanu ke varisht patrkaar kaashi yadav kehete hai ki sapa main bikharaav kaa phayda uthaane ke liye bijepi yadav sammelan kar rahi he, lekin use bahut zyada kamyaabi nahin milane vaali he
 The Yadav community is very politically aware
 maujuuda raajnneeti main apana bhala bura samajhataa he
 The way the Yadavs have been targeted since the coming of the BJP government is well known
 gauratlab he ki yadavon ko jodne ko lekar bijepi ne haal ke dinon main kai bade faisle liye hai
 The old leader of Etah region, Harnath Yadav has recently been sent by the BJP to the Rajya Sabha
 jabaki sanghathan main yuvaaon ke sabase bade sanghathan main subhash yaduvansh ko bhartiya janata party yuva morcha kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 Girish Yadav was made a minister when the Yogi government was formed in 2017
 iske alaava varanasi kshetra se aane vaale ek yadav ko vidhanparishad kaa sadsy bhi niyukt kiya he
 The BJP believes that it cannot separate any caste from itself and it thinks in totality
 bijepi yuva morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh subhash yaduvansh kaa kahana he ki yah hamaare pichde jatiyon ke sammelan kaa hi ek hissaa he
 The BJP does not hold any caste conference, but it is true that on September 15, our Yadavs and similar caste people are in the posts of the party
 unhen is kaarykram main bulaayaa gaya he

 input bhashaa se In terms of population, how many Chief Ministers are there in the country's largest state UP, this discussion has become hot once again
 vajah he satta main baithi party ke sabase taqatvar netaaon main aapasi khinchataan
 There is a discussion that CM Akhilesh Yadav is having to fight for the supremacy in his own family and perhaps this is the reason that for the first time in the history of Samajwadi Party government, the Chief Minister has not yet started the Saifai Festival even after four days have passed
 pradesh main paristhitiyaan kisi bhi rahi hon lekinspa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadavake paitruk gaanv main yadav parivaar har saal saifai mahotsav utane hi dhoomdhaam se manaata rahaa he
 When this opportunity comes to power, its color is different
 bade shaharon or bollywood ke chuninda sitaron kii chakachaundh is chote se gaanv main utar aati he or saifai nae saal kaa swaagat isi roshni main sarabor hokar karata he
 Artists also questioned the absence of CM, the absence of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav remains a matter of discussion in this program started on 26th December this year
 beete attharah saalon main aisa kabhi nahin hua ki parivaar ke ahm sadsy or samaajawaadee sarkaar main upi ke mukhyamantri ne saifai mahotsav main chaar din biit jane ke baavjood shirkat na kii ho
 Now, apart from party leaders, artists are also questioning this
 kalakaar surabhi tandon ne kaha, 'main is mahotsav main shuru se aa rahi hum or mukhyamantri kii kami khal rahi he
 The Chief Minister has been in many programs before us, but now we have come to perform in his house, then he is lacking, it is his family but if there are four utensils in the house, there will be a knock-out
 'to ye he naaraazgi kii vajah?siem akhilesh yadav ke naa aane ke peeche naaraazgi kii atakalein is charchaa ko or tool de rahi hai
 The biggest reason for this is being told that two of Akhilesh Yadav's close leaders Anand Bhadoria and Sunil Singh 'sajan' were expelled from the party just before the start of the Saifai Festival
 darasal bhadauria or saajan, donon netaa akhilesh yadav kii us kor team ke sadsy the jinhone 2012 chunaavon ke samay akhilesh ke chunaav prachaar kii kaman sanbhali thi
 After Akhilesh became the Chief Minister, both the leaders also got a reward from their CM
 us samay lohia vahini ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahe anand bhadauria ko jahaan jitin prasad ke khilaaf lok sabha chunaav ladane kaa tikat mila vahiin sapa kii chaatr ikai- samaajawaadee party chaatr sabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahe sunil singh ko ek korporation kaa adhyaksh bana kar mantri kaa darja diya gaya
 However, both of these leaders were shown the way out of the party on the charge of working against the party in the past panchayat elections
 sutara bataate hai ki siem akhilesh yadav ke party ke pradesh adhyaksh rahete hue bhi is faisle main unki raay nahin lee gai
 In such a situation, it is hot news in the political circles of UP that CM Akhilesh did not reach Saifai Festival to show his displeasure
 kuch vipakshi rajaneta to ise mukhyamantri kaa vidroh qaraar de rahe hai
 BJP said- there is some black in the pulses
 BJP BJP President Laxmikant Bajpai said, 'there is black in some lentils
 samay aane par clear bhi hoga
 But this thing is also right, the Chief Minister is distressed that a fair is going on in Saifai and the circumstances of the state are not favorable
 mela sthagit bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 There is bad law and order, the farmer is dying, and in the Saifai, the dance of the bars is done
 ye shaayad anuchit he
 He also said that the reason for this resentment is also the division of power in the house
 saadhe teen saal biit gaye lekin siem kuch bhi khyaati praapt nahin kar sake

 That is, it is not necessary to refer the matter to the bench of 7 judges again
 faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne kaha he ki ye saaf he ki nagaraj faisle ke mutabik data chahie
 But as a relief, it is not necessary for the state to collect quantitative data showing class backwardness and inadequacy of that class's representation in public employment
 is masale par supreme court ne centre or rajyon kii daleel sweekaar kii hai
 The Supreme Court has said that the state governments can consider reservation after releasing the data

 samvidhan ke anuchhed 335 kaa anupaalancourt ne kaha ki pichhadepan kaa nirdhaaran rajya sarkaron dwaara ekatra aankadon ke aadhaar par tay kiya jayega
 Explain that according to the decision of Nagaraj vs
 Union, reservation limit in promotion cannot exceed 50 percent
 is seemaa ko supreme court ne barkaraar rakhaa he
 At the same time, the court has also said that the principle of 'creamy layer' cannot be applied in SC-ST reservation in promotion of government jobs
 darasal, 2006 main supreme court kii 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne sarkari naukariyon main pramotion par aarakshan ko lekar faisla diya tha
 At that time, the court upheld some such arrangement with some conditions
 kya he em nagaraj kaa faisla?supreme court ne 2006 main cese main em
 Had given decision regarding Nagaraj
 court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki 'krimi layer' kii avadharana sarkari naukariyon kii padonnatiyon main essi-asti aarakshan main lagu nahin kii ja sakati, jaisaa anya pichhadaa varg main krimi layer ko lekar pehle ke do faislon 1992 ke indra saahani va anya banaam centre sarkaar (mandal ayog faisla) or 2005 ke ivi chinnaiyya banaam andhra pradesh ke faisle main kaha gaya tha
 But for reservation, state governments will have to provide quantitative data
 nagaraj faisle par kya tha centre kaa tark?darasal, isse pehle centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki 2006 main nagaraj maamle main aayaa faisla ST / SC karmchaariyon ke pramotion main aarakshan die jane main baadha daal rahaa he
 Therefore, this decision needs to be rethought
 haalanki, 12 saal baad bhi na to centre or na rajya sarkaron ne ye aankade die
 Instead, many state governments passed reservation laws in promotion, but due to the Supreme Court order, these laws were repealed

 haal main bataai gai jinson kii kul sankhya se yah 1,700 kam he, jabaki praarambhik anumaanon main isaki sankhya 100,000 bataai gai thi

 spanish rashtriya cancer research centre (sienio) ke aadharbhoot anusandhan ke upanideshak alphonso vailencia ne kaha, 'main ise sikudta hua (srinking) maanav jinom kahati hum
 The coding portion of the protein (protein-producing) has continued to grow
 kuch saal pehle tak koi yah soch bhi nahin saktaa tha ki ye genes itani kam sankhya main hote hue bhi kaise itnaa jatil kaam kar sakate hai
 The researchers integrated the facts from seven large-scale human spectrometry studies (50 human tissues) in order to measure which proteins actually produce proteins
 1,700 vaise genes kaa pataa chalaa, jinke bare main gyaat tha ki ve protein paidaa karte hai, lekin vastav main kai kaarnon se aisa nahin paaya gaya
 The reason for this was that either they had no structure related to coding or they lacked the ability of protein coding
 nishkarsh ke anusaar, protein paidaa karne vaale 90 fisadi se zyada maanav genes kii utpatti 10 karod saal pehle ke metajons yaa bahukoshikeey jeevon ke samay hui thi
 This clearly shows that at the level of jeans and proteins, the difference between humans and primates is very less

 Amid the ongoing debate over compromising the growth rate to curb inflation, Home Minister p Chidambaram said that a 9 percent economic growth rate is necessary to compete with a neighboring country like China
 unhone kaha ki oonchi aarthik vruddhi dar se na keval prati vyakti aay badhegi, balki china jaise padosi desh se muqabla bhi kiya ja sakegaa
 Chidambaram said, there is some argument that we should not try for 9 percent growth rate
 hamen 7 pratishat kaa lakshya hi rakhana chahie
 If we achieve a growth rate of 5 to 6 percent, it would be unfortunate
 unhone jor dekar kaha, hamen is tathy ko swikaarna hoga ki anya baaten jaruri hai, par kisi bhi sarkaar kaa pramukh uddeshy oonchi vruddhi dar hona chahie
 Advocating the high economic growth rate, Chidambaram said that China had left India behind in terms of per capita income in the 1990s, today the gap has widened
 unhone bataaya, china ne 1990 main prati vyakti aay ke maamle main bharat ko peeche choda tha
 China's per capita income doubled from India in 2003
 2040 tak china kii prati vyakti aay bharat se 3
 Will be 5 times
 us samay bharat main prati vyakti aay 24,000 dollar hogi jabaki china kii 85,000 dollar
 The Home Minister said that these figures will also raise concerns about safety

 congress ke liye yah raahat kii baat he ki mayawati uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar ke khilaaf satta-virdohi bhavanaaen badaae kaa intjaar karnaa chaahati hai
 The former chief minister is using this time to prepare his cadre

 isi tarah andhra pradesh main police 2016 main ek aaropee par rajdroh kaa aarope sabit karne main kaamyaab rahi
 There was a lot of debate in 2016 about the controversy over the sedition law at Jawaharlal Nehru University
 2016 main puure saal main desh bhar main sirf ek aaropee hi deshadroh main doshi sabit hua
 In 2016, a total of 35 cases of sedition were registered and 48 people were arrested
 26 ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar hui or andhra pradesh main sirf ek aaropee par dosha sabit hua
 In 2016, Haryana had the highest number of 12 arrests on sedition charges
 inamen se 8 ke khilaaf chargeshit daakhil kii gai lekin kisi par bhi aarope sabit nahin ho sakaa
 Let us know that in February 2016 in Haryana, there were incidents of violence due to demonstrations due to Jat agitation
 ye andolan jaaton ko obisi darje ke tahat aarakshan dene kii maang ko lekar tha
 a senior Haryana Police official says, "given the violence, the rate of conviction remains negligible, which is a failure
 lekin kai baar rajaneta hi hinsa ke aropiyon ko chhudaane ke liye dakhal dete hai
 The officer also cited reasons such as appeasement, vote bank politics, due to which police often succumbed to the pressure and the accused are left out
 tab teen din main 30 maut hui thim
 This indicates the failure of the police that treason charges could not be proved on anyone that year
 2016 main hi rajdroh ke aarope main rajasthan police ne 7 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 At the same time, four cases were registered in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, but the charges could not be proved anywhere
 andhra pradesh main ek giraftaar hui or aaropee par dosha sabit hua
 In 2015, 30 cases of sedition were registered in which 73 people were arrested
 bihar main sabase zyada 9 maamle darj hue jinamein 40 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Far from proving the blame, the Bihar police failed to file a charge sheet against any of the accused
 2014 main desh main rajdroh ke 47 maamle darj hue jinamein 58 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Chargesheet was filed against 16 accused
 lekin jharkhand main sirf ek aaropee par hi dosha sabit ho sakaa
 Statistics from 2014 to 2016 show that only one case of sedition was registered in Jammu and Kashmir in 2015, in which no progress could be made
 haal main algaavvaadi sanghathan dukhtaraane millat kii pramukh asia andrabi or uski do sahyogi mahilaon par rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ne rajdroh kaa aarope lagaaya he
 They were brought from Srinagar to Delhi and sent to judicial custody for 30 days earlier this week
 kendriya grih mantralay ke mutabik neshnal krime record beuro (NCRB) ke paas 2017 kaa data uplabdh nahin he, ise abhi tak sankalit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The sedition law in 2016 made a lot of headlines after the JNU controversy surfaced
 isamen jeenyu ke teen chaatro ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 He was allegedly accused of raising anti-national slogans on 9 February 2016
 haal hi main jeenyu prashasan ne umr khalid ko nishkasit kiya or kanhaiya kumaar par 10,000 rupye kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 The sedition law has been criticized by many critics as too harsh
 28 disambar 2015 ko congress saansad shashi tharur ne privet member bill ke jariye ipisi kii dhara 124 e (rajdroh) ko nae praavdhaan se badalane kii maang kii
 The Ministry of Home Affairs told the Parliament that the report of the Law Commission's study on the scope and use of the sedition law is yet to be received
 grih mantralay ne purv main vidhi or nyaay mantralay se vidhi ayog se aagrah karne ke liye kaha tha ki vah 124 e (rajdroh) ke praavdhaanon ke istemaal kaa adhyayan karen or sanshodhan sujhaaye
 According to Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir, the Law Commission is inspecting Section 124A
 draft report taiyaar kii ja rahi he ki rajdroh kanoon kaa dayera kya he or kin paristhitiyon main ise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 It was discussed in June but the report is yet to be finalized
 rajyasabha sansad vijay kumaar ne sawaal main poocha ki kya sarkaar isse avgat he ki abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke naam par rashtrawaad virdohi ghatnaayen bad rahi hai?ipisi kii dhara 124 e ( rajdroh) ke mutabik jo koi bhi maukhik athwa likhit shabdon, chinhon athwa anya prakaar se bharat main vidhi sampann rup se sthapit sarkaron ke viruddh nafrat, avmaananaa athwa asantosh bhadakaane kaa prayaas karata he, use umr kaid or athwa teen saal tak badhaai ja sakane vaali sajaa sunai ja sakati he
 The Law Commission is now working to define a clear definition of 'treason'

 Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley gave a budget speech of 1 hour 48 minutes
 haalanki beete saal bajet bhaashan ke dauraan arun jetali kaa shairana andaaj gaayab tha
 The record of giving a long budget speech has been in the name of Jaswant Singh, who was the finance minister in the NDA government

 In this, the accounting of the revenue is fixed for a few months or a few days
 ise mini bajet bhi kaha jaataa he
 Pakistan is also going to send manned space into space while competing with India
 isaki taiyaari lagbhag ho chuki he
 It is a different matter that Pakistan is not standing on its own feet in this matter and is going to send a vehicle with the help of China
 jabakibharatki taiyaariyaan apni hai or kaaphi dinon se isamen laga he
 There is talk of a partnership with Russia, but it has not been officially announced yet
 saal 2022 main pakistan apane mishan main kaamyaab ho jaataa he, to spes main bhi bharat ke saath uski pratispardhaaen dekhi jaaengi
 As Pakistan Information Minister Fawad Chaudhary announced on Thursday, if everything goes well, in 2022 Pakistan will also wave its flag in space

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made its official announcement from the ramparts of the Red Fort
 swatantraaa diwas par die apane sambodhan main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki bharat 2022 main jab apane 75wein aazaadee diwas main pravesh karegaa, to uski puri taiyaari hogi spes main kisi bhartiya vyakti ko bhejne kii

 It is under construction under the 'human Spaceflight Program (HSP)'

 Apart from this, every kind of test will be done for the selected people, in which mental and physical examination is important
 spes main koi ghatana ho to usase nipatane ke liye halki-phulki first aid lene kii bhi training di jaaegi
 In space too, Mahamukabalabharat and Pakistan may have set a 2022 launch date, but China has sent its vehicle long before that
 saal 2003 main china apana maanavyukt yaan bhejkar un teen deshon main shaamil ho gaya jo spes mishan main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Russia and America have also sent their vehicles before China
 ab jab bharat insaani spes mishan vaala chauthaa desh banane ja rahaa he, to pakistan ne bhi apni taiyaari tej kar di he
 Pakistan and China have a very deep strategic relationship
 china uskaa sabase bada dephence saplir bhi he
 Therefore, he is putting all his strength in the space mission of Pakistan
