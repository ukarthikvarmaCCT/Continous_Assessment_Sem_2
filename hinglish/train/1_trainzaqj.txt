 Call it an undisclosed settlement
 yaa ek raajnneetik paripati
 But except for a few exceptions this has happened
 bade netaa chaahe desh bhar main gum-gum kar ek-duusare par tikhe or karaare hamale karen, magar ek-duusare ke chunaav kshetron main prachaar karne nahin jate
 One such exception is Narendra Modi's rally in Rahul Gandhi's constituency Amethi
 bijepi ne amethi main modi kii raily karaane kaa faisla bahut soch-samaj kar kiya
 There is no opinion about this in the party
 kai bade netaa us aghoshit samjhaute yaa paripati ko todane ko khilaaf hai
 Even no big leader except Modi has gone there to promote the party
 amethi main modi kii raily karaane kaa faisla party ke mahasachiv or upi ke prabharee amit shah kaa mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, Shah believed that BJP as Smriti Irani is seen giving a tough fight to Rahul Gandhi in Amethi
 gandhi-nehru parivaar kaa garh ban chuke amethi main bijepi pehle bhi chunaav jeet chuki he
 Sanjay Singh, who came from Congress to BJP, won this seat in 1998
 haalanki tab sonia yaa rahul mukaable main nahin the
 Sonia Gandhi fought and won from here in 1999
 2004 main wo paas kii raibareli seat chali gayi or rahul gandhi yahaan se lade or tab se saansad hai
 The thinking behind Modi's rally in Amethi is that the BJP should be seen fighting in the entire state
 party raibareli kii tarah amethi main walk over nahin dena chaahati thi
 This was the thinking behind launching a strong candidate like Smriti Irani in Amethi
 raibareli main party sonia gandhi ke mukaable uma bharti ko utaarne kii soch rahi thi
 But this could not happen
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki puure desh main amethi-raibareli kii pahchaan gandhi parivaar se hone lagi he
 The locals are proud of this
 jabaki vipakshi dalon ke kaaryakartaaon ko ye santosh he ki isi bahaane kam se kam unki puch to hoti he
 It is sure that even though Amethi and Rae Bareli are VIP seats, like in other constituencies of Uttar Pradesh, there also dominates all the local issues
 bijli-sadak-pani jaisi buniyadi suvidhaon ko tarasate amethi or raibareli ke log ye ummid bhi chhod chuke hai ki sonia-rahul in muddon par zyaada dhyaan denge
 But Narendra Modi's campaigning in Amethi will change the result of the election there, it is very unlikely
 rahul ke chunaav kshetra main modi ke chunaav prachaar karne kaa makasad yahi dikhaanaa lagata he ki bijepi is ladaai ko behad gambhirtha se le rahi he
 It is no surprise that people are now asking what will happen in Amethi? However, there is no talk of any major reversal in the election results there
 mahatvapurn baat ye bhi he ki priyanka gandhi ne amethi or raibareli main deraa daal kar modi par sidhe hamale kiye hai or unhen iskaa jawaab dene ke liye majaboor kiya
 For almost one and a half weeks, Priyanka is seen in the media directly competing with Modi while rahul-sonia left behind
 sawaal ye he ki congress iskaa jawaab kaise degi? banaras main congressi ummidavaar ajay raay ke samarthan main prachaar kii baat se priyanka inkaar kar chuki hai
 There was news in the middle that Priyanka Kashi might visit Banaras on the pretext of visiting Vishwanath, but it was also denied
 congressi ranneetikaar is baat se bhi inkaar kar rahe hai ki banaras main sonia yaa rahul kii chunavi sabha hogi
 It is sure that the responsibility of strategizing for Ajay Rai in Benaras has been given to Ghulam Nabi Azad, the highly settled leader of Congress
 lekin ye sab baaten tab kii hai jab modi kaa amethi main chunavi sabha karne kaa kaarykram nahin bana tha
 Now in the changed situation, Congress may also think again on its strategy and bring Rahul or Sonia to campaign in Benaras
 1984 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko madhav raav sindhiya ne haraaya tha
 The stalwarts of all opposition parties, including BJP, were defeated
 loksabhaa main congress ke khilaaf bolne ke liye koi damdaar vipakshi netaa nahin bachaa tha
 Perhaps from this lesson, this undisclosed agreement or convention has been made that some big leaders are in the Lok Sabha is also important for democracy
 haalanki 1999 main bellari main sonia gandhi ke khilaaf sushamaa swaraj maidan main utari thi
 But the tradition of big political opponents not campaigning in the constituency remained

 Despite being the Human Resource Development Minister of the country, Smriti Irani had to go to school and interview for the admission of her children

 In this interview, the teachers and the principal of the school asked me and my children questions
 smriti irani ne kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki agar main mantri hum, sirf is vajah se niyamon kii andekhi nahin kii jaani chahie
 This is a responsibility that should not be misused

 Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday transferred DM Ravikant Singh of Gautam Budh Nagar, Noida
 ravikant ne hi ies afasar durgasakti nagpal ko clin chit di thi
 He was transferred overnight and did not receive any posting at the moment
 heeralaal gupta noida ke nae dm banenge
 The issuance of late night transfer orders by the UP government is shocking
 is bare main media ko jaankaree dene ke liye koi press note bhi nahin jari kiya gaya
 It is believed that DM Ravikant is facing punishment for giving clean chit to Durga Shakti Nagpal
 ravikant ko philhal hold par rakhte hue kahin or niyukti bhi nahin di gai hai
 It is worth mentioning that Durga Shakti Nagpal, a 2009 batch officer, is determined to fight against the illegal sand mining mafia of Noida
 gautamabuddha nagar main greater noida kii 28 varshiya esadm ne is saal farvari se july ke bich noida police ke saath milakar 66 exiar darj kin, apane jile main avaidh khanan se jude 104 log giraftaar kiye or 81 vaahan jabt kiye
 They formed flying squads of policemen who raided at any time from 11 am to 4 am in the night and Durga herself was present so that there was no disturbance
 unhen jaanane vaale adhikari or karmchaaree kehete hai ki in 6 maheenon main unhen gaanvvaalon, khanan mafia or is kaarobaar se rishte rakhane vaale netaaon se dhamkiyaan milin
 She was unflinching in her motive until the matter was out of the toleration of the ruling Samajwadi Party government
 27 july ko aanan-fanan main unhen nilambit kar diya gaya
 a common belief in Indian politics is that the country that wins Uttar Pradesh wins
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye 24 saal baad apane tamaam matbhed bhulaakar jab samaajawaadee party (espi) or bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ne gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya, to yah sawaal poocha jane laga ki is gathbandhan main congress kyon nahin he? is rahasy se pardaa uthaate hue upi ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha he ki chunavi ankaganit sahi karne ke liye congress ko gathbandhan se baahar rakhaa gaya
 If we weigh this answer given by SP President Akhilesh Yadav in up's political mathematics scales, then it will be clear why he said this? If a party got majority in Lok Sabha after 30 years in 2014 general election The reason for this was because the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 71 out of the total 80 seats in UP and the NDA got 73 seats
 in chunaavon main espi, bispi or congress akele ladi thim or bahukoniya mukaable kaa phayda bijepi ko mila
 But today's political situation is different, SP-BSP, once fierce opponents of each other, has joined hands to stop the bjp's chariot
 is samjhaute ke mutabik 38 siton par bispi or 37 siton par espi ladegi
 While 3 seats have been left for Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 to vahiin congress ke liye raibareli or amethi kii seat chodi gai he
 In the 2017 assembly elections, arithmetic was not good, Akhilesh Yadav said in an interview to a news agency that despite all the development work during his tenure, we lost the assembly elections because the electoral arithmetic was not good
 isliye hamane bispi or areldi ko saath lekar or congress ke liye 2 seat chhodkar ankaganit thik kar liya
 Explain that SP had aligned with Congress in UP assembly elections
 is gathbandhan main donon dalon kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa
 Prior to this, BSP has also contested elections in 1996 in alliance with Congress
 in chunaavon main bispi kaa vot to congress ko mila lekin congress kaa vot bispi ko transfar nahin hua
 In fact, the influence of the weakened Congress in UP has been limited to some urban areas and upper caste
 yah wo aabaadi he jo espi-bispi ke khilaaf vot karti he
 So in the case of Congress alliance with these two parties, this vote goes to BJP (where Congress is not a candidate)
 jabaki espi-bispi-areldi haal main hue kairana, phulpur or gorakhpur upachunaav main gathbandhan karke dekh chuke hai ki inke vot ek-duusare ke ummidavaaron ko mili
 In such a situation, the role of the Congress is no more than a vote cut, which will ultimately benefit both these parties
 bijepi ko nahin milegaa dharmik dhruvikaran kaa maukauttar pradesh ke sabhi vipakshi dalon ke ek saath aa jane se bijepi dwaara yah prachaar karnaa aasaan ho jaataa ki sabhi dal use haraane ke liye ikattha hue hai
 BJP has already declared SP and Congress as part of Muslims 
 aise main bijepi dwaara voton ke dhruvikaran kaa plan kaamyaab ho jaataa, jiskaa phayda bijepi ko hi miltaa
 But now it is clear that wherever the Congress contests, the BJP will reap the votes, not the alliance
 congress ke paas nahin he koi jatigat votbankcongress ko is gathbandhan se alag rakhane kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki uske paas kisi vishesh jati kaa votbank nahin he
 While SP has yadav-muslim, BSP has dalit-muslim and Ajit Singh has influence over Jat vote of West Uttar Pradesh
 congress kii samarthak zyaadaatar agadi jati or shahari madhyam varg he, jinhen floating vot kaha ja saktaa he
 This vote may go to BJP as an alternative to Congress, but not to SP-BSP
 congress ko bhi adhik siton par ladane kaa milegaa maukaagar congress sapa-basapa-areldi ke mini gathbandhan main shaamil hoti to pradesh main uski takat dekhte hue utani siten nahin milti jitani wo ladanaa chaahati
 The alliance proved this by giving 2 seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi
 lekin ab congress adhik siton par chunaav lard sakati he
 This situation is favorable for both the Congress and the coalition
 kyonki gathbandhan chahega ki congress zyada se zyada siton par bijepi kaa vot kaate

 com / euix7wwea0 In the current series between India and Australia, the captains of both teams will be remembered for a long time due to their strong performances
 test itihaas main pehali baar kisi series main captainon ne saat shatak banaae hai
 As captain, Virat Kohli scored three centuries in this series, while on the other hand, Steven Smith's bat also yielded the same number of centuries, while captain Michael Clarke scored an excellent century in the Adelaide Test
 is lihaaj se dekhen to viraat kohli or steven smith is series ke hero rahe
 Both of them got a chance to captain the Test for the first time and both showed that under the pressure of captaincy, their performance flourished
 steven smith ne is series main balle se dhamal dikhaate hue chaar shatakon kii badaulat 769 ran banaae
 He has become the highest run-scorer in a series of four or fewer Test matches at an average of over 128
 vahiin duusari ore viraat kohli ne series ke chaar test maichon kii aath pariyon main chaar shatak kii badaulat 692 ran banaae
 For India, this is the highest score by a batsman in a series on Australian ground
 edilade main series ke pehle test main viraat kohli ko team india kii ore se captaini kaa mauka mila or unhone donon pariyon main joardaar shatak jadkar itihaas bana diya
 Thanks to Kohli's century innings, Team India had reached a historic victory in Adelaide, although Kohli could not win the team, but he also won the hearts of his critics
 edilade test main australia kii captaini maaikel clark kar rahe the
 Despite the shock and backache of his friend Philip Hughes, he dared to score an outstanding century in the first innings of the Adelaide Test
 bristben or melbern main team india ke captaini mahendra singh dhoni ke jimme thi
 In the Brisbane Test, captain Dhoni could not do much with the bat, but in the second innings, when Australia had to score only 128 runs to win, they used their bowlers well
 australia ke chah wicket gir gaye, jisamen teen ke kaich dhoni ne hi lapke the
 But on the other hand, in just 25 years, Australia captain Steve Smith scored a century in the second Test in a row
 edilade ke pehle test main unhone note out 162 ran or noteout 52 ran banaae the
 In the first innings of Brisbane, Steven Smith scored 133 runs as captain, while in the second innings he contributed 28 runs
 melbern test main steven smith ne lagaataar tisare test main teesraa shatak thok diya
 He played a strong innings of 192 runs in the first innings
 smith agar doharaa shatak puraa kar lete to sabase kam umr main doharaa shatak banane vaale captain kaa record unke naam hota
 Don Bradman made this record in 1937 at the age of 28 years and 131 days
 steven smith is test kii duusari pari main mahaj 14 ran bana paae
 The captain of India in this Test was Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who saved the match for India by ticking the wicket in the second innings on a delicate occasion
 24 ran kii ahm pari ke dauraan hi vah bharat kii ore se test maichon main sabase zyada ran banane vaale captain ban gaye
 Dhoni has the highest number of 3454 runs for India as captain in Tests
 itnaa hi nahin unhone wicket ke peeche pehali pari main paanch or duusari pari main chaar shikaar banaae
 At the same time, he also took the world record of highest stumping behind the wicket
 isi test ke dauraan emes dhoni ne test se sanyas lekar cricket kii duniya ko chaunkaa diya
 Dhoni captained 60 Tests in 90 Tests, India's record of highest and most Test wins from India
 series ke aakhri test sidney main steven smith ne pehali pari main 117 ran or duusari pari main 71 ran thok die
 At the same time, Virat Kohli made history for India by scoring a century in the third consecutive innings as captain
 vah is mukaam tak pahunchane vaale iklaute cricketer hai
 Kohli scored 147 runs in the first innings and 46 runs in the second innings
 steven smith ko joardaar ballebaazi ke liye main of da series bhale chunaa gaya ho lekin viraat kohli kaa daawa kisi lihaaj se smith se kamatar nahin tha
 It is clear that this series was Virat Kohli's first series as captain, but the way he has introduced aggressive and responsible cricket, it is evident that he has prepared to replace Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 test maichon main dhoni ke baad viraat kohli kaa nayaa daur shuru ho chukaa he
 On the other hand, Steven Smith seems to fit perfectly in the role of Michael Clarke's contender
 haalanki donon ke paas anubhav kii kami jarur he, lekin aane vaale samay main yah donon vishwa cricket ke sabase joardaar captain ke taur par ubharne ke liye taiyaar hai

 In this context, the 'war' Hindi version crossed the 300 crore mark in just 28 days
 50 karod kaa collection kiya hoga

 'war', which made a grand opening on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, has left behind many big films of the year with its earnings
 itnaa hi nahin, sultan or padmavat ko pachhadte hue war hindi cinema kii saatvin sabase badi film ban gai he
 The special thing is that Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff's 'war' wielded a lot of magic abroad as well as capturing the box office in India
 kamai se itar film apane content or kalakaaron ke jariye darshakon kaa dil jeetne main bhi kaamyaab rahi he
 Especially the pair of Hrithik and Tiger got a lot of craze in the fans to see them on screen
 bataa den ki film 'war (war)' kii kahani 'kabir' ruthik roshan (hrithik Roshan) or 'khalid' tiger shroff (tiger Shroff) kii he
 The situation in the film is such that the Guru and the disciple are forced to collide with each other
 bekaabu guru par nakel kasne ke liye shishy khalid kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, or phir shuru hote hai jabardast ection
 Bikes, cars, helicopters, snow mountains are seen everywhere

 Apart from these, viewers will get plenty of action and stunts in 'war'

 adaani samooh ke chairman gautam adaani bhi wharton india ichonamik forum main bhaag nahin lenge
 This is revealed after the news of the cancellation of Narendra Modi's speech at the annual function held in Philadelphia, USA

 Prabhu said that Wharton had invited Modi himself
 modi ne nahin kaha tha ki unhen nimantran diya jaae or agar aap us nimantran ko radd kar rahe hai to mujhe lagata he ki yah sirf gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa hi nahin balki puure desh kaa apmaan he
 Regarding the reason for canceling the Wharton trip, Prabhu said that i have been a regular speaker in colleges and universities around the world, whether it is America or Japan, Singapore or Middle East
 unhone kaha ki modi kaa nimantran radd karne kaa faisla haasyaaspad he
 Modi did not ask for this invitation
 vah loktantric rup se chune gaye netaa hai or teen baar mukhyamantri rahe hai
 Modi is not one who rises up with the help of anyone
 vah chunaav ayog dwaara karaae gaye chunaavon main logon dwaara chune jane par unke pratinidhi banakar aae hai
 He said that the university should be a place where different views are debated
 is tarah kaa faisla samaj se baahar he, khaskar tab jabaki vah ek america vishvavidhyalay dwaara liya gaya ho
 Prabhu said that Gujarat is the leading developed and industrialized state of India

 desh main islam ko lekar hameshaa log alag-alag vichaar rakhti he, vahiin in muddon par raajnneeti bhi jamkar hoti he
 At a recent Hyderabad rally, MP Asaduddin Owaisi said that after demonetisation in Muslim areas, money was not available in atms and cash, the debate on politics and religion started on TV channels
 ye unheen vivaadon kii agali kadi si thi, jisamen kabhi bharat mata kii jai ke naare, kabhi suryanamaskara or kabhi teen talaak ke muddon ke bich islam par bahes kii gai
 But what is the real picture of Islam in India? Which is seen from the point of view of politicians in political rallies or through the cleric or the ulema or even more
 maujuuda halaat main yah sawaal pechida lag saktaa he, lekin jawaab aasaani se mil saktaa he, agarzamiya milia islamiyaamein chal rahe ek seminar main aapane islam par research karne waalon ko suna ho to, islam ke in vidwaanon ne charchaa to alag alag vishyon par kii, lekin ek baat ko lekar amrai nazar aayi or wo ye ki islam kii tasviir ko bharat main siyasat se juda karke dekhie or fark bhi mahasoos kiijie
 The difference is that the political people speak loudly and make a loud noise and the debate is done in the closed room debate on the squeeze of research, but see the irony that in the closed-door debate, the definition of Islam is as big, deep and spread
 In the political debates under the open sky, it is made as narrow as possible

 Iyer has said that he is deeply disappointed that even intelligent people like Tharoor are making such conclusions about Modi

 Actually, Congress spokesperson Shashi Tharoor said that pradhanmantri narendra modi ek vakt nafrat ke pratik maane jate the, lekin ab unhone khud ke vyaktitv ko aadhuniktaa or pragati ke avatar main badal diya he
 Shashi Tharoor has also said that it will not be considered a courtesy if the Congress adopts a stern attitude towards Modi's liberal and all-along initiative

 rajdhani ke jawaharlal nehru stadium main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak kaa manch sajaa he
 In this, the crowning of the new national president Amit Shah has to be stamped
 badi-badi do screen ke bichobich lage hordings barabas dhyaan khinchate hai jo bijepi main ek yug ke badlaav kaa sanket he
 In it, on the left is written under the picture of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani - One India, on the right, under the picture of Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi - Best India
 sandesh saaf he ki bijepi ab modi-shah yug main pravesh kar chuki he
 The writing on the hoardings was also stating that the seal of the National Council was a mere formality
 shah kii tajposhi ke peeche loksabhaa chunaavon main bataur prabharee mahasachiv uttar pradesh main unki apratyaashit safalataa ko maapdand bataaya ja rahaa he
 But the fact is that even before the Lok Sabha election results, Modi had started the exercise to make Shah the BJP President and gave a clear indication of how his vision for the party was
 is nazariye kaa khulaasa modi apane bhaashanon or kaamkaaj kii style se kar chuke hai
 Now from the same perspective, Shah is preparing to give a new face to the party
 unhone party main amul-chul badlaav kaa dirghakaalik khaakaa taiyaar kar liya he
 By the way, Modi and Shah's landing in national politics is similar in a sense
 modi pehle kabhi saansad bhi nahin rahe or pehali baar chune gaye or pradhanmantri kii kursi par kabiz ho gaye to kabhi pradesh ke adhyaksh bhi nahin rahe shah ab bijepi ke shahenshaah ban gaye hai
 Of course, now Shah will be expected to show success like Uttar Pradesh in terms of changes in party organization and the party's expansion into new areas
 jahiraa taur par isse unhen rashtriya pahchaan mili or ve bijepi main shikhar par pahunch gaye
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave Shah the man of the match award at the August 9 National Council meeting, saying, "if Amit does not come to Uttar Pradesh, then the country will not know about his potential
" ” haalanki shah ke upar soharabuddin farji muthbhed kaa mukadmaa chal rahaa he or isi maamle main unhen 2010 main jail bhi janaa padaa tha
 The bail granted three months later and the court's condition of staying out of Gujarat with him were difficult for his personal life, but proved to be favorable for his political career
 khud shah rashtriya str par apni safalataa kii kahani bharosemand logon ke saath nijee baatcheet main kuch yon bayaan karte hai, “jab mujhe do saal gujarat se baahar rahane ko majaboor hona padaa to maine dilli main rahete hue un lamhon kaa istemaal apana network banane main kiya
 During this time, i used to roam in Lucknow or other states of the country and at that time i became a lot of friends
 unheen doston se bana information network loksabhaa chunaav main mere kaam aayaa
 Out of the friends i made during that difficult time, i sorted some people and took their support personally
 ” ab bijepi ke sirmaur bane shah ne badlaav kii neenv rakhte hue 20 saal kii dirghakaalik yojana par kaam karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 The working style of the organization will change
 Under its long-term strategy, Shah's priorities are to make the organization effective and to establish cohesion between the party-government
 vaajapeyi-adwani yug se rajnath singh tak sahaj sulabh rahane vaale adhyaksh vaala yug khatm hone vaala he
 Shah's mood is different from that of his predecessors
 unke kareebi ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, “ve bheedbhad se dur rahane vaale shaks hai jinhen darbari raajnneeti pasand nahin
 They give preference to those working on the ground with solid figures
 ” 49 varshiya shah apni team main bhi apni umr se neeche ke logon ko laane kii taiyaari kar chuke hai
 During the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, he played the role of co-incharge with him and now he has given mission-year mantra to the state organization minister Sunil Bansal
 rajya sanghathan main padaadhikariyon kii adhiktam umr 40 varsh tak laane kii yojana par kaam karne kii salaah di gai he taaki agle 20 saal kii rajnatik yojana banaakar kaam kiya ja sake
 Ram Bahadur Rai, a senior journalist and analyst who keeps an eye on the Sangh and the BJP, says, "the specialty of Shah is that whoever comes in front of him, in two-three minutes guess that the person is of the organization's work
 Or parliamentary politics
 ” raay maanate hai, “shah sanghathan ko praathamikta denge
 In the Atal era, the post of organization minister coming from the Sangh was abolished because he dominated the presidents
 lekin ab shah use behaal kar rahe hai
 "shah is eyeing the bjp's wave in the UP assembly as well
" upi ko lekar shah kii soch kitni spasht he, ek varisht netaa bataate hai, “shah ne chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan party ke kuch netaaon se nijee baatcheet main kaha tha, “upi se ek bhi muslim jitkar nahin jayega
 “its basis was the strong blueprint of the caste-social equation, on the basis of which tickets were given
 sutron ke mutabik, shah kii yojana ati pichde or dalit varg se kuch chehre laakar 2017 se pehle nayaa netritv khadaa karne kii bhi he
 Therefore, preparations have also been made to crack down on the leaders especially in UP who go to Delhi to flatter or complain about the leaders
 haal main sampann rashtriya parishad kii baithak main party ko 97 aise sthaneey netaaon ke pahunchane kii report mili he jo parishad ke sadsy nahin the
 But to show face, he had joined the council meeting in a fake way
 sangh-bijepi rishton kaa nayaa adhyaypahale 2004 ke chunaav main endie kii haar or phir 2005 main laalkrishna adwani ke jinna prakaran ke baad sangh-bijepi ke rishte khattey-mithe hi rahe hai
 But after the 2014 Lok Sabha election victory, a new chapter of relationships has started
 shah or modi donon ke gujarat se hone ko lekar sangh ko hichak thi, lekin vaajapeyi sarkaar ke anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sangh ne hari jhdi de di
 a senior Sangh leader said that when the top leaders of the Sangh sat for the final decision, their opinion was made, "the party and the government should remain the same center
 modi ko free hand diya jaae taaki baad main yah shikaayat karne kii sthiti nahin ho ki jo vah karnaa chaahate the, unhen nahin karne diya gaya
 "amit Shah's team will show a glimpse of new relations of the sangh-bjp
 sangh kaaryakarini ke sadsy ram madhav or prachaarak shivaprakash ko bijepi main bhejne or bina kisi badi aupchaarik jimmedaari ke har badi baithak main ram madhav kii maujuudagi behatar samanvay kii ore ishaara karti he
 He can be given the responsibility of co-ordinating the government-party by making him general secretary or vice-president
 sutron ke mutabik, sanghathan main is baar sanghathan mahaamantri ke alaava paanch se chah sah sanghathan mantri honge
 There are preparations to bring two or three other pracharaks from South India
 pehali baar bijepi ke kisi adhyaksh kii team main sangh se kam-se-kam saat prachaarak shaamil honge
 The example of coordination in the relationship is that on issues like GM crop and insurance, labor reforms, some leaders of the Sangh's subsidiaries blew the bugle against the Modi government but no big leader of the Sangh spoke
 nai peedi kii dream timeek jatke main sanghathan se puraane logon ko vidaa karnaa aasaan nahin he isliye sutron kaa kahana he ki shah agar apni team main kuch puraane or umr main bade logon ko shaamil kar bhi lete hai to nirnay prakriya main un padaadhikariyon kii bhoomika simit rahegi
 Shah's strategy is to place young people from states at the center, by putting old people in positions that are constitutionally important, and this team will truly be Shah's team that will work in parallel
 shah aankadon or jamini tathy ke saath ranneeti banaate hai or sanghathan main bhi yahi chaahate hai
 In the coming time, BJP will now have politics on the basis of data and technology will be used for dialogue-coordination
 shah ne sanghathan kii kaaryastylee badalane ke liye sabase pehle khud par use amal main laana shuru kar diya he
 For example, it has been decided not to use charter aircraft and helicopters
 amuman bade netaa pradeshon ke daure main hotalon main thaharnaa pasand karte hai, lekin shah ne upi main sangh kii pranali apanaai or kaaryakartaaon ke pariwaron main hi tehre
 Says analyst Rai, "shah, after adopting the old Sangh style, communicated directly with the workers
 ab apni us pranali ko ve shaayad puure desh main apanaayenge
 “the BJP now has to monitor the entire system by outsourcing it
 shah adhyaksh ke bajaae ek siio kii bhoomika main honge, lekin jaisaa ki ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki iskaa matlab yah nahin hoga ki kaaryakartaaon ko nanandaaj kiya jayega
 According to sources, Shah will not be easily accessible, but as the matter of workers reaches the center, a separate mechanism will be created for him
 ek varisht netaa ke mutabik, yah pranali thik usee tarah hogi jaise aaj ke jamaane main internet banking hoti he
 Wherever you go to the bank, the bank gets the job done
 usee tarah kaaryakartaaon kii baat centre tak pahunch jaae or unhen dilli aakar netaaon kii parikrama na kerani pade
 modi-shah's strategy is to prepare the dream team and field the new BJP in the next Lok Sabha elections
 shah or modi kii kaaryastylee se saaf he ki bijepi main vahi tikega jo daud sakegaa
 The caste-based people have a perception about preferencebjp that it is a Brahmin-party
 lekin atal-adwani yug ke baad modi-shah yug main pravesh kar chuki bijepi kii badi chunauti is dharna ko todakar use saamaajik nyaay kii party banane kii he
 This attitude is also being discussed in the party during the days of the Ram Mandir movement as all the big faces of BJP were non-brahmins in this era, but later the situation changed
 bijepi kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha 11 sadasyeey sansadeey board main aaj bhi chah netaa brahman samudaay se hai
 But this domination in Shah's team will end
 shah rashtriya parishad kii baithak main saaf kar chuke hai ki ab party ko nae kshetra main ghuskar dirghakaalik raajnneeti kerani he
 In this regard, the party's major focus is Uttar Pradesh assembly elections
 isi ranneeti ke tahat modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav se upie sarkaar kii ore se jat aarakshan die jane ke faisle kaa supreme court main bachaav kiya he
 According to sources, in order to break Mayawati's vote bank in UP, the Modi government is considering to push the reservation bill with a political profit-loss strategy soon
 isi ranneeti ke tahat shah ne bijepi ke samvidhan main sanshodhan bhi karavaaya he
 According to the new amendment, the number of office bearers in states with more than 40 Lok Sabha seats will be increased
 haalanki isamen sankhya kii seemaa tay nahin kii gai he
 a senior BJP leader explains, “earlier the team used to include the recommended faces of a senior leader
 lekin is sanshodhan ke baad shah apni pasand ke logon ko badhayenge
 "similarly, in Jharkhand, Shah along with tribal Arjun Munda has made a strategy to advance Raghuvar Das of Dalit society so that the social equation can be corrected
 jaahir he ki bijepi ab atal-adwani yug kii chaaya se baahar nikal chuki he to duusari peedi ke netaaon main modi sheersh purush ban chuke hai jo nai takanic or yuva josh ke saath bijepi ko nae rang-rup main dhaalane kii yojana ko amalijama pehanaane main jute hai or shah modi ke sapanom kii bijepi kaa jariya ban chuke hai
 At the moment, Lalu is laughing back at Nitish's government, while the responsibility to do so will not come on him

 Its major parts: RJD is not in the government

 They must have been introspecting why they had to leave
 un par tippni karne vaala main koun hota hum?par raghuvansh prasad singh jaise argedy nitish se aagrah kar rahe hai ki ve maanjhi ko dipti siem banaakar le aaen
 There is democracy in our party
 har kisi ko apni raay dene kaa adhikaar he
 Your MP from Madhepura, Pappu Yadav has also said that RJD should prefer Manjhi rather than Nitish? He will have a problem of his own
 gathbandhan sahyogi ke bataur aap nitish ko kaisaa pate hai?hamaara kaam secular takaton ko majbootee or garibon ko insaaf sunishchit karnaa he
 Then why did RJD not take a stake in the government? Why don't you both give good governance? Because we did not have the mandate in the 2010 assembly elections
 janadesh nitishji ke saath tha, isliye sarkaar unhen chalaani chahie
 This is the time to go to the people, to alert them against the conspiracies of the BJP and not to become a minister for a few months
 kya aap sarkaar par nigaraanee bhi rakhenge yaa kisi nunatam saajha kaarykram par jor denge?main kyon nigaraanee karuunga? agar jarurat hogi to main nitishji se baat kar luungaa

 varisht netaaon ko saath lekar aage kii ladaai ladanaa chaahati he congressharyana main purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda lead role main aaecongress party main gutbaji lambey vakt se jari he
 Earlier it used to go behind the curtain, but now it has started coming out in front
 aisi sthiti main party alaakaman ke liye rasta dhundhna mushkil bharaa ho gaya he
 However, the new working president Sonia Gandhi wants to fight the battle ahead with senior leaders
 haryana, madhya pradesh or rajasthan main mache ghamaasan ko dekhte hue unhone varisht netaaon ko tarjeeh dete hue apni good book main rakhaa he
 In such a situation, senior leaders are seen to be overshadowing the youth leadership
 bhupendra singh hooda vs ashok tanvarharyana kii gutbaji ko dekhte hue party aalakaman ne varisht netaaon ke saath vidhansabha chunaav main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 The party has been entrusted with the responsibility of the state president by Kumari Selja
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda kaa lead role main aana or haryana pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh pad se ashok tanvar kii chuttee se saaf jaahir he ki team sonia gandhi kii chali he
 It is not hidden from anyone that Ashok Tanwar is Rahul Gandhi's choice
 tamaam rassakashi ke baavjood wo pichley 6 saal se party ke pradesh adhyaksh bane rahe
 Actually, Bhupendra Singh Hooda has always felt difficulty in keeping track with Tanwar's attitude
 unhen ye bhi malaal rahaa ki unki varishthata ko zyada tavajjo nahin di ja rahi thi or to or ashok tanvar rahul gandhi ko report karte the
 It may have hurt Hooda's honor and since then, he was cold
 vaise hooda or tanvar ke bich khinchataan ne uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle tool pakad liya tha
 Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot The bitterness between Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Deputy CM Sachin Pilot is not hidden from anyone
 haal hi main rajeev gandhi jayanti par donon diggajon ne ek-duusare ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 In this program, CM Gehlot had said that when there was a famine in Rajasthan, Rajiv Gandhi gave immediate help after listening to us
 is par dipti siem ne tanj kasate hue kaha tha ki mukhyamantri ji jis tarah se rajeev gandhi ne aapaki baat maani thi, usee tarah se aap bhi vidhayakon kii baat maniye
 Actually, the race for the throne started between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot before the return of Congress in Rajasthan
 kyonki rahul gandhi ne sachin payalat ke saath-saath ashok gahalot ko bhi vidhansabha chunaav main ladaane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Gehlot vs Pilot controversy started within the Congress in the state only after Gehlot landed in the election ground
 us dauraan gahalot bhi siem kii kursi kii chahat main jute rahe or apane anubhav kii baaten kah-kahkar sachin payalat ko kamatar sabit karte rahe
 However, one reason behind Sachin Pilot was that the party did not get the seats as expected in Rajasthan
 bahumat se party ek seat dur hi rahi
 If the number of seats was 125, then Sachin Pilot would have fallen heavily on Gehlot
 vahiin, party ke alaakaman ko bhi lag gaya tha ki anubhav ko hi tarjeeh dena vaazib hoga
 Jyotiraditya Scindia vs Kamal Nath is not taking the name of the pandemonium over the state president of Madhya Pradesh
 15 saal baad satta main vaapasi karne vaali congress ke bhale hi achche din aa gaye hon, lekin soobe main yuva netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ke din nahin badale
 Scindia, once seen as the face of the Chief Minister, first fell behind Kamal Nath in this race and then lost his seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 is dohare jatke se ubarne ke liye jyotiraditya madhya pradesh main hi apana sikaa jamaana chaahate hai
 For this, his eyes are fixed on the PCC Chief's chair
 iske liye unke samarthakon ne morcha khol diya he
 Scindia has also sent his message to Chief Minister Kamal Nath
 unhone kaha ki sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad party ke bheetar matbhedon ko hal karnaa mukhyamantri kii hi jimmedaari he
 At the same time, Kamal Nath has already given a big message to Delhi by breaking two BJP mlas
 aise main yahaan bhi alaakaman kamalnath par pehle bharosa jataayegi
 On Tuesday, two former captains of the Indian cricket team, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, participated in the session titled 'preparing for the 2019 World Cup' of Hindi Agenda Aaj Tak
 is satr ke dauraan donon diggajon ne kuch halke or kuch gambhir pahaluon ko chuaa
 When asked former captain Sunil Gavaskar whether he believed that the Indian team would win the World Cup, he said yes of course
 unhone kaha ki vah chaahate hai ki lords main hone vaale final main aakhri over kii aakhri gend ho mahendra singh dhoni ballebaaji kar rahe hon or saamne se pakistan ke tej gendbaaj mohammad aamir gend daalen or jeet ke liye 6 ranon kii darkaar ho
 Hit Dhoni Sixer on the ball coming inside Aamir and make the same gesture as he did in the 2011 World Cup final
 gavaskar ne bataaya- IPL ke liye kapil dev hote nilaam, to kitne kii lagati boli?sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki maujuuda team kii sabase badi kamajori gendbaaji he, khaastaur par aakhri over main zyada ran de jate hai
 That is why the team likes to chase
 lekin yadi pakistan jaisi team ne 300 ranon se zyada kaa lakshya khadaa kar diya, to ballebaajon par dabaav bad jaataa he
 He said that the biggest strength of this team is batting
 rohit sharma, viraat kohli jaise ballebaaj kabhi-kabhi neeche khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko mauka nahin mil paata
 At the same time, Kapil Dev said that his heart says we will win, but the mind says that a lot of hard work needs to be done
 chayan acha hona chahie
 There should be no injury in the last four to five weeks
 or jab ham maan lete hai ki ek khilaadi hamen toornament jita degaa, tab haar kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 Kapil said that this team's confidence is its biggest strength and over-confidence is the biggest weakness

 Neither Modi leaves any chance nor does Rahul hawk by running 'shabdaban'

 BJP specializes in distribution politics
 
 
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ham aatankwaad se ladane ke saath-saath desh main vikaas bhi karnaa jaanate hai jabaki bijepi ke log keval baantne kii raajnneeti karnaa or logon ko aapas main baantne or ladvane kaa kaam jaanate hai
 He once again described Modi's Gujarat model as a toffee model, saying that the government had helped only one industrialist, Adani, to the tune of 40 thousand crores and in ten years he became a man of 300 crores to 40 thousand crores
 jabaki upie sarkaar ne manaregaa main 30 hajaar karod rupaya daalaa or karodon garib mazdooron ko kam se kam 100 din kaa rojgaar mila
 Rahul said, 'this is the only difference between him and us
 vah udyogpatiyon ke bare main sochate hai jabaki ham garib, kisaan majdoor ke bare main sochate hai
 "everyone's blood and sweat is swept in the progress of the country", said Rahul Gandhi, while encircling the BJP, he talks of India Shining, India is shining in his eyes and all this has happened due to his belief that BJP people But in my view, the progress that has been made in India has sweated the blood of the laborers, poor, farmers, young people, job professionals and police personnel standing here
 rahul ne kaha ki endie kii sarkaar main aatankwaad kii vajah se kareeb 22 hajaar log maare gayi the or unke ek mantri gidgidaate hue afghanistan ke qandahar gaye the
 The hostages were freed by apologizing to the terrorists
 'hindu-musalmaan ko ladaane kii baat karti he bijepi'ham aatankwaad ko khatm karne ke saath-saath vikaas kii bhi baat karte hai or bijepi keval hindu se musalmaan ko ladaane or sikh ko isaai se ladaane kii baat karte hai
 He accused the Modi government of Gujarat that the common man is not well in Gujarat but only some industrial houses close to the government
 unhone kaha ki isi tarah tata ko bhi saste dar par gujarat sarkaar ne karj uplabdh karavaaya
 The poor farmers' land there is being given to industrialists close to the government
 'ham karte hai aam janata ke liye kaam or modi'rahul ne kaha ki modi or hamaare main yahi fark he ki vah udyogpatiyon ke bare main sochate he or ham or upie sarkaar aam deshavaasiyon ke bare main
 They gave money to Adani, gave money to Tata, our government gave employment like MNREGA to the common man
 isi tarah ab bhojan kaa adhikaar diya
 He said that look at the figures of Gujarat government, there are 40 lakh people below BPL, 40 percent people do not have drinking water
 10 lakh yuva berozegaar hai phir bhi yah gujarat model ko puure desh main lagu karne kii baat kehete hai
 Rahul enumerated the achievements of the UPA He counted the achievements of the UPA government and said that in the last five years, our government built more roads than the NDA government's tenure, doubling the power generation

 aadhikarik sutron ne bataaya ki malik ne chidambaram ke saath telephone par vaarta kar is mudde par baatcheet kii
 In fact, Pakistan's anti-terrorism Court has sought an explanation from the Government of Pakistan about whether it has received permission from Indian authorities to send a commission
 sutron ke mutabik chidambaram ne kaha he ki vah pakistani prastaav par gaur karenge or kanoon ke visheshgyon se paraamarsh karne ke baad jawaab denge
 Malik called Chidambaram and told that the Pakistani court has expressed such a wish, which is dependent on the consent of the Indian authorities

 During a conversation with poet and writer Prasoon Joshi, the Prime Minister talked about his personal experiences as well as the functioning of the government
 is dauraan ek sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha ki desh main vikaas sirf sarkaar nahin kar sakati he, ye ek janabhagidaari kaa kaam hona chahie
 The Prime Minister said, "democracy is not a contract agreement that i voted for today
 5 saal kaam karo main baad main puuchhuunga ki kya kiya, varanaa duusare ko le aaunga
 This is not a labor contract, it is a partnership work ''
 darasal, pradhanmantri se sawaal poocha gaya tha ki unhone sarkaar ke saath-saath logon ko bhi kaam par laga diya
 People are also working with the government today
 PM modi ne sunai sargical strike kii kahani- PAK ko phone kar kaha tha laashen uthva loise sawaal ke jawaab main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jab azaadi kii ladaai ladi ja rahi thi, to 1857 se 1947 tak desh main kai log aise the to desh ke liye mar-mitane ke liye taiyaar the
 And it used to be like this everywhere, people were fighting, martyred and then another one stood up
 lekin mahatma gandhi ne is ladaai ko jan andolan bana diya, agar koi kuch bhi kar rahaa hota tha to use azaadi ke saath jod diya
 The PM said that Mahatma Gandhi told the people that if you are sweeping, you are working for freedom, even if you are a teacher
 apni baat kehete hue unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne pichley kuch samay main ye hi kiya he
 He told that we are taking people along with everyone in making a toilet, in the campaign of Swachh Bharat
 agar janabhagidaari hogi tabhi vikaas hoga, sarkaar akele dampar vikaas nahin kar paaegi

 Thousands of Jat community members from northern states reached Jantar Mantar here to support the ongoing agitation in Haryana
 jat andolankaaree naukariyon or shiksha main aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 Roads leading to the protest site were filled with Jat agitators from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Punjab, causing trouble to the drivers passing through the area
 aayojan sthal tak pahunchane vaale pradarshnakariyon kii bheed se nipatane ke liye pramukh chauraahon or margon par police or yatayaat karmiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 Yashpal Malik, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Jat Reservation Sangharsh Samiti, who is spearheading the agitation, said, "jat justice dharna is being organized at Jantar Mantar to express their demand for justice and reservation for members of the Jat community in Haryana '
 unhone bataaya ki samudaay ke sadsy aarakshan ko lekar raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ko ek gyaapan soupenge or sansad kii ore march nikaalenge
 The comments anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) shrenee ke antargat shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan kii maang ke alaava jat pichley saal ke andolan ke dauraan jail main band logon ko reeha karne, pradarshan ke dauraan daayar kiye gayi maamalon ko waapas lene or is dauraan maare gayi or ghayal hue logon ke parijanon ko naukari dene kii maang kar rahe hai
 Last year, 30 people were killed and property worth crores of rupees was damaged in several places in Haryana during the violence during the Jat agitation
 uttar pradesh, haryana, uttarakhand, dilli or punjab ke jat andolankariyon se pradarshan sthal kii ore jane vaali sadaken bhar gayi, jiske chalate us ilaake se guzarane vaale vaahan chaalkon ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Police and traffic personnel were stationed at major intersections and routes to deal with the crowd of protesters reaching the venue
 andolan kaa netritv kar rahe akhil bhartiya jat aarakshan sangharsh samiti ke adhyaksh yashpal malik ne kaha, 'haryana main jat samudaay ke sadasyon ke liye nyaay or aarakshan kii apni maang ko mukhar banane ke liye jantar mantar par jat nyaay dharna kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he'
 He informed that members of the community will submit a memorandum to the President and Prime Minister regarding reservation and will march towards Parliament
 tippaniyan Apart from the demand for reservation in education and government jobs under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, the Jats were released during the last year's agitation to release jailed people, withdraw cases filed during demonstrations and were killed in the meantime
 They are demanding to provide jobs to the families of the injured

 i did not think about shooting, even if it was said that the message would go away in a concrete way
 meri raay main pradhanmantri ko aise atirek se bachanaa chahie tha
 For the cow protectors whom he had been referring to for two days as anti-social elements, fake cow protectors, a handful group who broke the unity of India, for them to say shoot me but do not kill my Dalit brothers
 jo log pradhanmantri kii nazar main kanoon or samaaj ke apradhi hai unhen hamaare pradhanantri ko goli maarane kii ijazat katai nahin di ja sakati
 In Allahabad's Parivartan rally also the Prime Minister had said that give me a chance in UP, if you do any harm to any of your work in five years, then you will kick me out
 pradhanmantri ko laat maarna yaa goli maarna tip ke atirek se bachanaa hi chahie
 The moral responsibility of the problem on which he was speaking remains his, as many incidents have happened in his or his party's governed states
 magar aisa nahin he ki daliton par hinsa kii ghatana duusare dalon kii sarkaron main nahin hui he
 The incident of atrocities on Dalits is also taking place or where the BJP government is not there
 lekin desh ke pradhanmantri ke naate yaa kai rajyon main sarkaar chalaane vaali bijepi ke sarvocch netaa hone ke naate ve yah chetavanee pehle bhi de sakate the
 Due to refusal, the message was sent to many people that these cow guards have the patronage of the BJP governments, the support of the Sangh and the Sangh organizations
 isliye inke khilaaf bijepi shasit sarkaron ne bhi koi thos karrwai nahin kii magar yah bhi sahi he gaiyr bijepi sarkaron ne bhi in gau rakshakon ko waisi hi chhot di
 He also did not take any concrete action
 ve bhi laachaar nazar aae
 Therefore, the Prime Minister should address this problem, not on its own pretext
 par pradhanmantri ke duusare rup ko dekhnaa he to aap jiesti par die gaye unke bhaashan ko sun sakate hai
 How easily he spoke a technical topic in the House
 saralata se bhi or udaartaa se bhi
 If the Finance Minister does not mind, then he can learn this art from the Prime Minister on how to communicate with the public on GST
 lekin kya baat he ki jiesti par saralata or udaartaa se bolne vaale pradhanmantri ke gau rakshakon par die bayaan ko vipaksh ne us tarah swaagat nahin kiya jis tarah pakistan main rajnath singh ke bhaashan kaa kiya
 The first criticism was that the first was that he only spoke about Dalits and not about Muslims, while they are also being victims of this violence
 duusari aalochana yah ho rahi he ki unhone bahut der se bolaa
 But what the critics are not able to see is that in a jolt with this statement, the political, religious and social recognition of these cow guards has ended
 abhi tak ye jab bhi screen yaa sadak par avatarit hote the to kisi vichaardhaara or sarkaar ke sangrakshan main palane vaale asaamaajik tatv lagate the
 The Prime Minister has confirmed them to be anti-social elements
 pehle bhi kuch log in gau rakshakon kii harkaton ko bharat ke loktantr kaa khatara bataa rahe the, fark ye tha ki tab soshal media ke utpaati samarthak inhen sarkaar virdohi chashme se dekh rahe the, bharat ko badnaam karne vaale tatv ke rup main dekh rahe the
 If the Prime Minister had said this earlier, no party could have dared to beat and beat up four Dalit youths in Una in Gujarat
 madhya pradesh ke railway stesan par ek garib mahila ko utaar kar use maaraa nahin jaataa
 He would not have dared to arrest him after killing
 na hi haryana main us vyakti ko gau rakshak trek se utaar kar gobar or mutr pilaa pate
 Dadri's Akhalaq would not have been murdered and then there would have been no politics of sophists
 kam se kam pradhanmantri us vakt to roak hi sakate the jab bihar ke chunaavon main bijepi ke postaron par gaay kii tasviir chap rahi thi
 Only about such inflammatory posters, the Election Commission has demanded clear powers from the Center so that they can be banned
 ye nakli gau rakshak koun hai
 Which ideology thrives in the political ashram
 sach baat ye he ki ye tab bhi the jab bijepi kii sarkaar centre yaa kai rajyon main nahin thi
 It may be that their production has increased in two years
 jab centre ke mantri or bijepi ke netaa gau raksha ke naam par unheen tewaron main bayaan dene lagen to kya asamaajik kaary karne vaale gau rakshak, donon ek hi bhashaa main baat karte nazar nahin aae
 The Prime Minister and the Union have given an open message to the state governments saying that the curriculum vitae of all of them should be ready and strict action should be taken
 unke bayaan kaa yah sabase majboot paksh he ve unheen rajya sarkaron ko karrwai ke liye kah rahe hai jin par shah dene ke aarope hai
 Let's see in which state the action takes place
 madhya pradesh main yaa haryana main yaa upi bihar yaa bengal main
 Gau Rakshak has gone out of the Prime Minister's statement, the RSS also issued a statement on Sunday night and supported the Prime Minister's statement
 aresas ne bhi kaha he ki samaaj ke kuch asaamaajik tatwon dwaara gau raksha ke naam par kuch sthanon par kanoon apane haath main lekar evam hinsa failaakar samaaj kaa sauhaard dooshit karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 By this, efforts are being made to pollute the harmony of society by spreading violence towards the sacred work of cow protection and cow service
 aresas deshavaasiyon se aahvaan karata he ki gau raksha ke naam par kuch mutthi bhar avasarwaadi logon ke aise nindaneey prayaason ko, gau raksha ke pavitra kaary main lage deshavaasiyon se naa joden or unka asli cheharaa saamne laayen
 The union, which claims the presence of its organization and branch on the chatter, is also appealing to the people to bring out the real face of such people
 ye apil apane swayansavekon se kerani thi ki aap pataa kar bijepi sarkaron ke mantriyon ko soochna den or karrwai karavaayen
 But there is another statement of the Sangh, why we had to issue a second statement, we cannot tell it, but it took a lot of revenge
 kaha gaya ki vartmaan samay main desh ke vibhinn sthanon par anusuchit jati ke bandhuon par atyaachaar evam utpeedan kii ho rahi ghatnaon kii rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kade shabdon main ghor ninda karata he
 Taking the law in your hands and torturing the captives of your own society, it not only shows injustice, but also inhumanity
 kya anusuchit jati jodne ke liye somvaar ko bayaan jari hua
 But in both the statements there was no mention of Muslims
 iske alaava sangh kuch balance bhi karata nazar aayaa
 The Prime Minister has called seventy eight percent of cow guards as anti-social elements
 sangh ke bayaan main kuch mutthi bhar gau rakshakon kii baat kahi gai he
 When the atrocities of cow guards were discussed in the Rajya Sabha, apart from the mps of the opposition party, Mayawati had clearly said that in the name of cow protection, Muslims were tortured all over the country, with the youth and now in Madhya Pradesh
 In where the BJP government is, the women were beaten up publicly, the police kept watching the spectacle, the crowd kept watching the spectacle
 is sambandh main sarkaar kya kahana chaahegi?tippaniyan The Prime Minister rightly said that if cows are stopped feeding plastic, then that will be the biggest cow protection
 unhen apni party kii sarkaron ko bhi alag se nirdesh dena chahie tha ki kyonki madhya pradesh or rajasthan ne gaay se sambadhit vibhaag kii sthapana kii he
 Even after this, according to the news of Rajasthan magazine, 27,000 cows died in the last three years at Hingonia Gau Shala in Jaipur, Rajasthan
 ham apni taraf se is report kii pushti nahin kar sakate phir bhi yah sankhya itani badi he ki gau shaalaaon ke bheetar kii kuvyavastha par eemaandaar nazar kii maang karti he
 Cows die due to disease, but if a single cow dies of hunger, it is painful
 sangh ko bhi un sachche gau rakshakon se poochna chahie tha ki ve gaayon kii raksha karte karte kahaan nikal gaye hai ki gau shaalaaon main gaayen mar rahi hai
 Where are the cows when the cow is not safe in schools? yah sawaal sirf rajasthan se hi nahin balki bihar or bengal se bhi poocha janaa chahie ki unke yahaan kii gau shaalaaon kii kya sthiti he
 The Prime Minister should avoid kicking or shot type redundancy
 jis samasya par ve bol rahe the uski naitik zimmedaari unki to banati hi he, kyonki kai ghatnaayen unke yaa unki party kii shasit rajyon main hui hai
 But it is not that violence on Dalits has not happened in the governments of other parties
 daliton par atyaachaar kii ghatana vahaan bhi ho rahi he yaa hui he jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar nahin he
 But as the Prime Minister of the country or as the supreme leader of the BJP which runs the government in many states, he could have given this warning earlier also
 na dene ke kaaran kai logon main sandesh gaya ki in gau rakshakon ko bijepi kii sarkaron kaa sangrakshan praapt he, sangh or sangh ke sanghathanon kaa samarthan praapt he
 Therefore, bjp-ruled governments did not take any concrete action against them, but it is also true that non-bjp governments also gave the same exemption to these cow guards
 unhone ne bhi koi thos karrwai nahin kii
 They also looked helpless
 isliye pradhanmantri is samasya ko sambodhit karen, na ki iske bahaane khud ko
 But to see the second form of Prime Minister, you can listen to his speech given on GST
 ek technical vishay ko ve kitni saralata se sadan main bol gaye
 Simple as well as generous
 agar vitt mantri ko bura na lage to ve pradhanmantri se ye kala sikh sakate hai ki jiesti par janata se kaise samvaad kiya ja saktaa he
 But what is the matter that the Opposition did not welcome the Prime Minister's statement on cow guards who spoke with ease and generosity on GST, just as Rajnath Singh's speech in Pakistan
 pehali aalochana yah hui ki pehla ki unhone sirf daliton ke bare main kaha, musalamaanon ke bare main nahin jabaki is hinsa ke shikaar ve bhi ho rahe hai
 The second criticism is that he spoke too late
 lekin kya aalochak yah nahin dekh paa rahe hai ki unke is bayaan se ek jatke main in gau rakshakon kii raajnneetik, dharmik or saamaajik manyata samaapt ho gai he
 Till now, whenever they appeared on the screen or on the road, there used to be anti-social elements in the protection of any ideology and government
 pradhanmantri ne inke asaamaajit tatv hone kii pushti kar di he
 Earlier too some people were describing the actions of these cow guards as a threat to the democracy of India, the difference was that at that time the pro-social media supporters were looking at them through anti-government spectacles, seeing India as a defaming element
 
 pradhanmantri yahi baat pehle kah dete to hamaare gujarat ke oona main chaar dalit yuvakon ko ardhangn kar peetane kaa saahas koi dal nahin kar paata
 a poor woman is not killed by killing her at a railway station in Madhya Pradesh
 maarane ke baad use giraftaar karne kii himmat na hoti
 Nor would he have been able to take the cow from a cow guard truck in Haryana and drink cow dung and urine
 dadri ke akhlaaq kii hatya na hoti or uske baad kutarkon kii raajnneeti na hoti
 At least the Prime Minister could have stopped at the time when a picture of a cow was being printed on BJP posters in Bihar elections
 aise bhadakaau postaron ke bare main hi chunaav ayog ne centre se spasht adhikaar maange hai taaki in par pabandi lagaai ja sake
 Who are these fake cow guards? ye kis vichaardhaara ke raajnneetik ashram main palate badhate hai
 The truth is that these were even when the BJP government was not in the center or in many states
 ho saktaa he ki inkaa utpaat do saal main zyada bad gaya ho
 When Union ministers and BJP leaders start making statements in the same tone in the name of Gau Raksha, both cow protectors who do anti-social work are not seen speaking in the same language
 pradhanmantri or sangh ne rajya sarkaron ko yah kah kar khulaa sandesh de diya he ki in sabakaa biodeta taiyaar ho or sakht karrwai kii jaae
 This is the strongest aspect of his statement
 They are asking the same state governments to take action against those accused of incitement
 dekhte hai kis rajya main karrwai hoti he
 In Madhya Pradesh or Haryana or in UP Bihar or Bengal
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se gau rakshak machal gaye hai, aresas ne bhi ravivaar raat bayaan jari kar pradhanmantri ke bayaan kaa samarthan kar diya
 The RSS has also said that efforts are being made by some anti-social elements of the society to destroy the harmony of the society by taking laws in their name and spreading violence in the name of cow protection
 isse gau raksha or gau seva ke pavitra kaary ke prati hinsa failaakar samaaj kaa sauhaard dooshit karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 The RSS calls upon the countrymen not to add such deplorable efforts of a handful of opportunists in the name of cow protection to the countrymen engaged in the sacred work of cow protection and bring out their real face
 chapche chappe par apane sanghathan or shakha kii maujuudagi kaa daawa karne vaale sangh ko bhi logon se apil kerani pad rahi he ki ve aise logon kaa asli cheharaa saamne laayen
 This appeal was to be made to your volunteers and you should find out and inform the ministers of the BJP governments and get them to take action
 lekin sangh kaa ek or bayaan he, doosraa bayaan kyon jari karnaa padaa ye to ham nahin bataa sakate lekin usamen kaaphi kuch badla badla sa laga
 It was said that at present, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh strongly condemns the incidents of atrocities and harassment of scheduled caste brothers in various places of the country
 kanoon apane haath main lekar apane hi samaaj ke bandhuon ko pratadit karnaa yah keval anyaay hi nahin, amanviyata ko bhi prakat karata he
 Was the statement released on Monday to add Scheduled Caste
 par donon hi bayaan main musalamaanon kaa koi zikr nahin aayaa
 Apart from this, the Sangh was also seen doing some balance
 pradhanmantri ne sattar assi fisadi gau rakshakon ko asamaajik tatv kaha he
 a handful of cow defenders have been mentioned in the Sangh's statement
 jab gau rakshakon ke atyaachaar par rajyasabha main charchaa hui tab virdohi dal ke saansadon ke alaava mayawati ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki gauraksha ke naam par pehle puure desh ke andar musalmaan ke saath utpeedan kiya gaya, yuvak ke saath kiya gaya or ab madhya pradesh main jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he, vahaan par mahilaon ko saream peeta gaya, police tamaasha dekhati rahi, bheed tamaasha dekhati rahi
 What would the government like to say in this regard? Comments pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki gaayon ko plastic khilvaanaa band kar diya jaae to vahi sabase badi gau raksha hogi
 He should also have given separate instructions to the governments of his party that Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have established cow related departments
 iske baad bhi rajasthan patrika kii is khabar ke mutabik rajasthan ke jaipur ke hingonia gau shaala main pichley teen saal main 27,000 gaayen mar gayi
 We cannot confirm this report from our side, yet this number is so large that the cow demands an honest look at the mismanagement within the schools
 beemaari ke kaaran gaayon kii maut hoti he lekin bhukh se ek bhi gaay mari he to yah dardanaak he
 The Sangh should also have asked those true cow guards that where they have gone out protecting the cows that cows are dying in cow houses
 gaayen jab gau shaalaaon main surakshit nahin he to kahaan hai
 This question should be asked not only from Rajasthan but also from Bihar and Bengal, what is the status of their cow schools
 par pradhanmantri ke duusare rup ko dekhnaa he to aap jiesti par die gaye unke bhaashan ko sun sakate hai
 How easily he spoke a technical topic in the House
 saralata se bhi or udaartaa se bhi
 If the Finance Minister does not mind, then he can learn this art from the Prime Minister on how to communicate with the public on GST
 lekin kya baat he ki jiesti par saralata or udaartaa se bolne vaale pradhanmantri ke gau rakshakon par die bayaan ko vipaksh ne us tarah swaagat nahin kiya jis tarah pakistan main rajnath singh ke bhaashan kaa kiya
 The first criticism was that the first was that he only spoke about Dalits and not about Muslims, while they are also being victims of this violence
 duusari aalochana yah ho rahi he ki unhone bahut der se bolaa
 But what the critics are not able to see is that in a jolt with this statement, the political, religious and social recognition of these cow guards has ended
 abhi tak ye jab bhi screen yaa sadak par avatarit hote the to kisi vichaardhaara or sarkaar ke sangrakshan main palane vaale asaamaajik tatv lagate the
 The Prime Minister has confirmed them to be anti-social elements
 pehle bhi kuch log in gau rakshakon kii harkaton ko bharat ke loktantr kaa khatara bataa rahe the, fark ye tha ki tab soshal media ke utpaati samarthak inhen sarkaar virdohi chashme se dekh rahe the, bharat ko badnaam karne vaale tatv ke rup main dekh rahe the
 If the Prime Minister had said this earlier, no party could have dared to beat and beat up four Dalit youths in Una in Gujarat
 madhya pradesh ke railway stesan par ek garib mahila ko utaar kar use maaraa nahin jaataa
 He would not have dared to arrest him after killing
 na hi haryana main us vyakti ko gau rakshak trek se utaar kar gobar or mutr pilaa pate
 Dadri's Akhalaq would not have been murdered and then there would have been no politics of sophists
 kam se kam pradhanmantri us vakt to roak hi sakate the jab bihar ke chunaavon main bijepi ke postaron par gaay kii tasviir chap rahi thi
 Only about such inflammatory posters, the Election Commission has demanded clear powers from the Center so that they can be banned
 ye nakli gau rakshak koun hai
 Which ideology thrives in the political ashram
 sach baat ye he ki ye tab bhi the jab bijepi kii sarkaar centre yaa kai rajyon main nahin thi
 It may be that their production has increased in two years
 jab centre ke mantri or bijepi ke netaa gau raksha ke naam par unheen tewaron main bayaan dene lagen to kya asamaajik kaary karne vaale gau rakshak, donon ek hi bhashaa main baat karte nazar nahin aae
 The Prime Minister and the Union have given an open message to the state governments saying that the curriculum vitae of all of them should be ready and strict action should be taken
 unke bayaan kaa yah sabase majboot paksh he ve unheen rajya sarkaron ko karrwai ke liye kah rahe hai jin par shah dene ke aarope hai
 Let's see in which state the action takes place
 madhya pradesh main yaa haryana main yaa upi bihar yaa bengal main
 Gau Rakshak has gone out of the Prime Minister's statement, the RSS also issued a statement on Sunday night and supported the Prime Minister's statement

 Usually, after the mention of the chair, the image of the leader who takes the reins of politics emerges in our mind, but that chair is not being talked about here
 is kahani main us kursi kii baat kii ja rahi he, jisapar baithkar pulisavaale kanoon kaa raaj qaayam karte hai
 Will anyone believe that there is a police station in this country, where, except to sit in a chair kept, only by seeing it the breath of the big police officers stops
 rajasthan ke barmer ke mandali ilaake main ek police thane kii imaarat hameshaa viraan rahati he
 Day or night, no one dares to go to a special room in this police station
 yahi vajah he ki 100 saal baad ajtak is imaarat ke andar kaa raaj jaanane ko majaboor hua
 The fast running life of the city comes to a stop at this police station
 100 saal puraane is thane main ek aisa raaj dafan he ki aam log to kya, sangeenon se las police ke bade afasar bhi iskaa rukh nahin karte
 The reason for the officers running away from this police station is a chair of the police station
 thane ke kamare main rakhi wo kursi, jisapar jo afasar ek baar baitha, wo barbaad ho gaya
 The question is, why do the policemen get cold as soon as they step inside the police station? Why does this chair scare the police officers so much? If you sit in a chair, why do the officers get scared even after looking at it? After all, what is the story of this chair of the police station? Actually, when the unhonies start becoming part of life, then they also affect our life, making them think
 kuch aisa hi rahasy he is imaarat kaa
 There is a similar story about a chair placed in a building and this is an incident
 isaki imaarat bhi ek aisi hi anhoni kahani bayaan karti he, jisamen kab kiskaa kirdaar kya likh jaae, ye koi nahin jaanata
 Even the biggest police officers are afraid to step foot in this building
 wo bhi tab, jabaki imaarat baqayada ek thana he
 The chair play here is unique
 kaha to yahi jaataa he ki ab tak jis kisi afasar ne is kursi par baithne kii himmat dikhaai, vah dobaaraa is kursi par nahin baith paaya
 Not only this, he did not get any chair across the district again
 thane main jo bada afasar aayaa, wo bas thane kii had se baahar nikalate hi naukari se yaa to suspend ho gaya yaa phir uskaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 Although it is necessary for the top police officers to visit every police station in the district once a year, but no officer came to this police station of Barmer for many years
 hairat to yah he ki yahaan ke logon ne to lambe vakt se jile ke police captain kaa cheharaa tak nahin dekha he
 The fear of the chair is understandable, but the soldiers living in the police station are not unaware of it
 dar unamem bhi he
 Recently posted soldier Mohanram Sahamte says that he does not sleep at night
 naa to is thane kii imaarat viraan he or na hi isse judaa koi aisa itihaas he, jisamen dar basataa ho
 People are foolish
 bedadak aate-jate hai, lekin vardeevaale kaufajada rahete hai
 In order to keep himself safe from this mist of mystery, the Bawardi proper policemen illuminate the lamp here every night
 darasal samadhi or diye kii kahani 100 baras puraani he or itane hi baras se police officer is thane se kaufajada hai
 If you believe the story heard, then 100 years ago, there used to be a Baba named Bholanath inside the Mandali police station
 police ke sipaahi or daaroga baba kii seva karte the
 Meanwhile, the mother of the officer posted in the police station died
 jab afasar ne apane police captain se maa ke antim sanskaar main jane ke liye chuttee maangi, to afasaron ne chuttee dene se inkaar kar diya
 People of the area believe that after this incident Baba cursed the police officers
 tab se lekar ab tak jo bhi police kaa bada afasar thane main qadam rakhata he wo suspend ho jaataa he yaa phir jila-badar kar diya jaataa he
 Call it superstition or something else, but it is true that dozens of officers visiting this police station have been suspended
 pichley ek saal main teen adhikariyon ne yahaan jane kii himmat dikhaai, lekin unamem se ek adhikari ko suspend hona padaa, jabaki do kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 There are many more such cases where logic does not work
 haath aati he sirf ek abujh paheli, jise sulajhaaye jane kii koshishen aae din hoti rahati hai
 Everything is not going well these days in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar
 somvaar ko iskaa ek taaja udhaaharan us samay dekhne ko mila jab purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne tikhe shabdon main kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan par hamalaa bolaa
 Manjhi attacked Paswan for the first time in response to questions from reporters in his constituency Makhdumpur
 darasal, maanjhi har maukey par paswan dwaara unhen nicha dikhaae jane par na keval pareshaan the balki unhone man bana liya ki ab paswan se saarvajanik rup se do-do haath kar hisaab baraabar karenge
 Recently, while participating in a program of a channel, Ram Vilas Paswan had said that Manjhi is a state level leader while he said about himself that he is a national level Dalit leader
 yahi nahin paswan ne maanjhi par vyangy karte hue kaha ki wo rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan main nae-nae aae hai or unhen abhi sabit karnaa baaki he ki wo apni jati maanjhi kaa vot trsanfer kara pate hai ki nahin
 Responding to this, Manjhi said that he is worried about his family and not the Dalits and should not make the mistake of considering them as ants, because ants can also defeat elephants
 tippaniyan Manjhi asked Paswan why his son, brother or son-in-law is in every position in his party
 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya
 But it is believed that if the BJP leaders do not intervene in the coming days, then the war between these two Dalit leaders may intensify
 mana ja rahaa he ki maanjhi, paswan or unke bete chiraag paswan ke un bayanon se bhi naaraaz chal rahe hai jisamen chiraag ne maanjhi ke party ke kai netaaon ko gathbandhan se tikat na dene kii vakaalat kii he
 In fact, Manjhi was not only upset about Paswan being let down by him at every opportunity, but he made up his mind that now he would be able to settle two accounts with Paswan publicly
 pichley dinon ek channel ke kaarykram main bhaag lete hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha tha ki maanjhi rajya str netaa hai jabaki apane bare main unhone kaha ki wo rashtriya str ke dalit netaa hai
 Not only this, Paswan sarcastically said that he has come new to the National Democratic Alliance and he has yet to prove whether he can transfer his caste Manjhi's vote
 isi ke jawaab main maanjhi ne apni bhadaas nikaalte hue kaha ki paswan ko keval apane parivaar kii chintaa rahati he na ki daliton kii or wo unhen cheentee samajhane kii galati na karen kyonki cheentee bhi hathi ko parrast kar sakati he
 The comments maanjhi ne paswan se poocha ki aakhir unki party main har pad par unke bete, bhai yaa damaad hi kyon asin hai
 Certainly Paswan was not aware of this attack by Manjhi and when asked his response on Monday, he deferred questions
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale dinon main agar bijepi ke netaaon ne hastkshep nahin kiya to in donon dalit netaaon ke bich vakyuddh or tej ho saktaa he
 It is believed that Manjhi is also angry with Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan's statements in which Chirag has advocated for not giving tickets to Manjhi's party leaders from the coalition
 yahi nahin paswan ne maanjhi par vyangy karte hue kaha ki wo rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan main nae-nae aae hai or unhen abhi sabit karnaa baaki he ki wo apni jati maanjhi kaa vot trsanfer kara pate hai ki nahin
 Responding to this, Manjhi said that he is worried about his family and not the Dalits and should not make the mistake of considering them as ants, because ants can also defeat elephants

 What will happen in the future? What will the future look like These questions arise in everyone's mind
 abhi tak kii bollywood or hollywood filmon main bhavishya ko lekar hameshaa technology, udati hui gaadiyaan hi dikhaai gai hai
 But this style has been slightly changed in the new series Laila on Netflix
 huma kuraishi kii is series main 2047 kaa vakt dikhaaya gaya he, jo bataata he ki abhi or tab main zyada antar nahin rahane vaala he
 However, the future shown in the series is a bit intimidating
 or isi ko lekar soshal media par ek tagdi bahes bhi chhidi he
 Because there will be something that can surprise everyone
 6 episod kii laila series main dikhaae die kuch aise hi bade points padhein
 
 
 Water will hit! In this story of 2047, water begins at the beginning
 pani ko lekar kai hisson main bheed he, log ek duusare se lard rahe hai
 Drinking water from the drain, like atms, there is a place of water that work is going on by purchasing it
 to vahiin huma kuraishi kaa kairactor shalini bhi pani ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se apane ghar main laata he or swimming pool banaata he, jo ki unke parivaar ke maut kaa kaaran banataa he
 Not only that black rains, drinking black water can also surprise everyone
 taj mahal vidhwans!1992 main hue babari vidhwans ne abhi tak bharat kii raajnneeti main jagah banaai hui he
 But can anyone drop the Taj Mahal, which is considered a sign of love? laila main aisa hi dikhaaya gaya he, jab hindu raashtra aryavart kii sthapana hoti he to joshi ji (kirdaar kaa naam) ke samarthak tajmahal ko gira dete hai
 a scene in the series also depicts the Taj Mahal dropping
 aryavart kii sthapana!abhi tak kii filmon main bhavishya ko alag hi tareeke se dikhaaya gaya he, har kisi ke paas ghar he, paisa he lekin ye series kuch nayaa laai he
 By then, the country has become Aryavarta and operates under a single rule
 har koi ek duusare ko jai aryavart kahkar sambodhit kar rahaa he
 a community is being victimized
 huma kuraishi ke kirdaar kii shaadi bhi ek vishesh samudaay se hoti he, isliye unhen siries main shuddhi dilaai jaati he
 The process of purification! Series has shown a place in the labor center
 ye aryavart kii hi jagah he, jahaan par mahilaon ko jabaran laayaa jaataa he
 Where they are made to work and remorse, for example, Hindu women who have done anything contrary to religion, are married to a Muslim youth
 yaa mahila hone kii maryaada ko laangha he
 At this place, the juthan is fed, the wages are paid and sent to factories
 abhi tak kii bhavishya vaali filmon main hamen aisa nahin dekhne ko miltaa he, kyonki 21veen sadi main mahilaon kii barabari kii baat hoti he
 Which seems like further expansion but the perspective of the series shows a different factor
 imaaraton se ooncha hota kooday kaa dher!climet change kaa gyaan is samay duniyabar main dekhne-sunne ko miltaa he
 However, this cleanliness drive is not visible in 2047
 series main kai aise seen hai jo kooday ke pahaad se dhake hue hai or imaaraton se oonchi kooday kii oonchai he
 Which is telling your future as scary
 agar baat puri series kii karen to isamen kul 6 episod hai, ek episod kii lambaai kareeb 40 se 50 minute hai
 The entire story revolves around Huma Qureshi and her daughter
 unke alaava south superstar siddharth ne bhi series main shandaar role kiya he
 However, at some places the series will be seen to bore you
 lekin netflix ne har baar kii tarah kuch alag karne kii hi koshish kii he

 10 sitambar ko konitish kumaarake jamshedpur daure ko lekar raghuvar das ne nitish kumaar ko sawaalon ke ghere main liya he
 Raghuvar Das has attacked Nitish Kumar in three tweets on 18 October
 raghuvar das ke hamale par jediu ne talkh tevar apanaae or bijepi par palatwaar karte hue kanoon kaa danda dikhaa diya
 Raghuvar Das said - Nitish Namdar, i am Kamdar Chief Minister, actually Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das tweeted and asked Nitish Kumar what the people with him did in the hotel
 is par nitish kumaar ko kuch bolnaa chahie
 Raghuvar Das while attacking Nitish Kumar said that Nitish Namdar is the Chief Minister, i am Kamdar
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ko is par bhi jawaab dena chahie ki unke gathbandhan ke hi logon ne unhen paristhitivash mukhyamantri kaha he
 On the statement of Raghuvar Das, JDU retaliated by showing the BJP the rule of law on Sunday
 jediu ke pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne is par palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki atal-adwani kii parampara ko chhod kar bijepi nae raajnneetik vichaar se aakraant ho gai he
 The new age BJP has nothing to do with democratic values and accepted traditions
 bijepi ke vidhayak rajakishor kesari kis aarope main maare gaye, yah puraa desh jaanata he
 Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das should not express unparliamentary sentiment

 These questionnaires were shot by Das who attacked Nitish Kumar, saying that some people who accompanied him during the tour of Jamshedpur were seen in a hotel in Bishtupur after the meeting
 yahaan par unki har harkaton ko sisitivi camere ne kaid kar liya he
 Only after this, while CM Raghuvar Das tweeted in this matter, Bihar CM had asked that Nitish Kumar tell what happened in the hotel

 Before the T20 match against South Africa at Dharamshala, Virat Kohli said, "one of the great things about him (dhoni) is that he thinks for Indian cricket

 aapaki najar main rahul gandhi jaise adhyaksh kaa vikalp koun hoga? agar aap kisi aisi party ke sadsy hai jisapar vanshavaad haaavee rahaa he yaa jise congress ke naam se janaa jaataa he, to ek maatr vikalp hongi unki bahan, priyanka gandhi
 Successful public leaders like Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh are rarely seen in the Congress these days
 ab unhone bhi priyanka gandhi wadra ko party adhyaksh banaae jane kii shashi tharur kii maang kaa samarthan kar diya he
 Amarinder Singh said that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would be a right choice as Congress President
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi ko is par faisla lene kii jarurat hogi lekin agar vah congress adhyaksh chuni jaati hai to har taraf se unhen samarthan milegaa
 In an interview to PTI on Sunday, Tharoor said that he hopes Priyanka Gandhi will contest for the post of party president
 unhone saath hi yah bhi kaha ki yah nirnay gandhi parivaar ko lenaa he ki vah is pad ke liye maidan main rahengi yaa nahin
 At the same time, Tharoor clearly stated that the 'lack of clarity' about leadership after Rahul Gandhi's resignation is hurting the party
 tharur congress kaarysmiti ke sabhi mahatvapurn padon ke liye chunaav chaahate hai taaki aane vaale nae netaaon ke liye maarg prashast ho
 In an interview to NDTV, Tharoor said that the Congress Working Committee cannot decide on the next president as its own members have not come to the polls
 priyanka gandhi ko adhyaksh banaae jane kii nai maang tab uthi he jab congress karnataka main apni gathbandhan sarkaar bachaane main naakaam rahi he
 Although this was perhaps the biggest sign of Congress being in a coma after Rahul Gandhi stepped down as party president 70 days ago, the party gave some signs of reform when Amarinder Singh's talk about Priyanka Gandhi being made public was made public
 
 lekin is maang ke saath samasya yah he ki unke bhai rahul gandhi vishesh rup se kah chuke hai ki jab wo pad chhod rahe hai to unke parivaar se koi unki jagah na le
 Although it seems that there is no option left for Priyanka Gandhi, but before writing this column, the senior Congress leaders i spoke to said that only Priyanka is the only one who can stop the party split because Team Sonia and Team Rahul is face to face
 apni maa sonia gandhi kii tulana main rahul gandhi kaa party adhyaksh ke rup main 18 maheene kaa kaarykaal ashaanti se bharaa tha
 Sonia served as the party chief for 19 years, the longest tenure in the Congress
 ek senior netaa ne tark diya, 'rahul gandhi ne apane faisle par nahin sochaa
 How can he prevent his sister from becoming the president
 khaas taur par jab party aisa chaahati he
 Which non-gandhi party president will be able to work with all members of the Gandhi family in active politics
 'saaf taur par congress offis main gandhi parivaar ek vinamr hathi he or koi bhi senior netaa unke khilaaf nahin jayega
 Priyanka Gandhi was initially reluctant for this post but after the current crisis that has gripped the party, the party also wants them to come
 gauratlab he ki congress ke paas halhi main hua ek ghatnakram he jisamen priyanka gandhi ne upi ke siem yogi adityanath se sidhi takkar lee thi
 Priyanka tried to meet the families of 10 people killed in the Sonbhadra violence
 priyanka ko hiraasat main liya gaya tha or unhone puri raat guest house main bitaai thi
 He had insisted that he was sent there by Rahul Gandhi
 us samay rahul gandhi sanyukt rajya america main the
 But it indicates how warring Priyanka is
 anyathaa vah isse pehle keval isliye trend kar rahi thim kyonki vah apane bhai kii pad par bane naa rahane kii ichha kaa saath de rahi thim
 i had also written earlier that Sonbhadra was not a Belchi moment
 daadi indira kii tarah priyanka ek tej rajaneta ke taur par ubharin
 And the Congress managed to attack itself as some leaders tried to reach the guest house in support of it
 lekin congress ke liye, koi gandhi galat nahin kar saktaa
 Priyanka still has a long way to go to establish herself as a major leader with the electorate and ensure that Sonbhadra is not Rahul Gandhi's Bhatta Parsaul affair
 mayawati sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan kaa virodh karne ke liye may 2011 main rahul gandhi upi ke gaanv main pradarshan karne bike se gaye the or unhen giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Ultimately this became just another moment in Rahul Gandhi's shoot and scoot school of politics, when he failed to maintain any continuity on the issue
 tharur or singh ne bataaya tha ki congress kya soch rahi he
 And it is not possible that he did this without the superficial knowledge of Priyanka Gandhi
 sonia gandhi pehle hi senior netaaon kii apil ko thukraa chuki hai ki vah antarim adhyaksh bane
 Perhaps the Congress, which is struggling with lack of power, where all decisions were issued in the name of Rahul Gandhi, is now a different story after his resignation
 shaayad karnataka sarkaar kaapatan or tamilnadu ke sahyogi or diemke pramukh stallin dwaara die gaya vishaal sanket unhen raajnneetik satta se dur kar rahaa he
 The DMK chief invited West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to inaugurate the political statue of her father Karunanidhi in Chennai on 7 August
 jabaki banerjee aupchaarik sahyogi nahin hai
 In December last year, Sonia Gandhi was also invited for a similar honor
 isliye jab gandhi ne bahut zyada dharna pradarshan kiya to is baat ke sanket hai ki party main koi giravat nahin he lekin unamem he
 Gandhi is both a stress factor and a stress response

 centre sarkaar july se puure desh main guds and services tex lagu karne kii taiyaari main juty he
 Where the central government is expected to increase income after the implementation of GST
 vahiin yah bhi daawa he ki jiesti desh main bade kaarobaari maukey saath lekar aayega
 GST will prove to be a big relief for the central government as unemployment figures are troubling it
 iske chalate sarkaar ne 75 lakh rupee ke turnover vaale kaarobaariyon se sabase zyada ummid laga rakhi he
 There are large scale trading, manufacturing and restaurant businesses in this turnover country
 in kshetron main jiesti ke baad kaarobaar main or tej hone kii sambhaavna he
 The central government will levy 1 percent tax from the people doing the trading
 vahiin manuphacchirang karne vaale chote kaarobaariyon se 2 fisadi or restaurant kaarobaar karne waalon se 5 fisadi tex lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 At present, all these services were highly taxed
 khaas baat yah he ki sabase zyada tex chori bhi inhi kshetron main hoti thi
 a study by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) found that a 1% increase in GDP would create 2
5 million new jobs
 jiesti ke lagu hone ke baad se GDP 2% se 2
 Expected to grow by 5%
 jisase logon kii aay badhegi natijatan logon kii kharid shakti bhi badhegi
 Sunil Goyal, MD, Global Hunt, says that jobs will come in the first 1-2 years after the implementation of GST in accounting and training companies
 menuphaccharing, emmemasiji, i-commers, telecom, automotive or media sector hi sabase zyada phaayde main hoga
 Most jobs will also be available in these areas

 'ab dekhnaa he ki kya sarkaar kii ummid par jiesti khara utarataa he or chote kaarobaari is tex saugat kaa phayda uthaate hue nai naukariyaan paidaa karne main safal hote hai
 For Pakistani leaders, it becomes akin to Agneepath when it comes to advancing relations with India
 is baat ko pradhanmantri navaj sharif se behatar bhala or koun samaj saktaa he
 They have lost power once again and they have once again placed it at stake
 unhone tay kiya he ki rishton kii door ko 1999 main unhone jahaan choda tha, vahiin se aage badhayenge
 He accepted the invitation to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ignoring the huge skepticism in his country
 uske baad sab bekaar chalaa gaya
 The resumption of Foreign Secretary level talks was hampered and harsh statements sour the atmosphere
 upha shikhar baithak ke dauraan donon pradhanmantriyon ke bich mulaakaat kii bharat kii taraf se kii gai pahal ne is gatirodh ko todaa
 But the backdrop of tensions prevailing for the past one year due to the heat on both sides did not allow expectations from this meeting
 pakistan main maahaul main khaasaa badlaav he or yah dharna lagaataar bad rahi he ki nae bhartiya netaa ko aage badaae main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Modi's speech in Dhaka in June and then the release of Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks of a Pakistani court, were clearly indicative of a deteriorating relationship
 khaas taur par pakistani log bhartiya netritv ke hamalavar tewaron se ashankit the
 Apparently, Sharif was under great pressure when he went for the Ufa summit
 isliye koi hairat kii baat nahin ki baithak ke nattejey se pakistan main kaaphi gussa upja he
 There, many opposition parties have accused Sharif of following the Indian signals
 bhartiya pradhanmantri kii ore kai kadam badhkar jane vaali unki chaal se lekar sanyukt vaktavy kii shabdaawalee tak, sharif par kai gahare nishane saadhe gaye hai
 The swords were drawn at the same time when the two leaders shook hands
 purv grih mantri or ab pakistan piples party (pipipi) ke seenetter rahamaan malik kaa ek twit viral ho gaya tha
 In it, he said, "our Prime Minister had to walk in a long corridor and Narendra Modi did not show such decency that he would go ahead and receive him
" '' baithak ke baad donon videsh sachivon ke sanyukt vaktavy se to maano hamalon kii bauchhaar-si ho gai
 Opposition leaders accused Sharif of kneeling
 imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party kii pravaktaa shirin majaari bhi kahaan peeche rahane vaali thim
 "it was a draft written by Indians on which our Prime Minister signed it," he alleged
 '' majaari ne mahasoos kiya ki bhartiya shasnadhyaksh ko pakistan kii yatra kaa sharif kaa nyotaa gaiyr-jaruri or ''kootnithik shishtachar kii jaruraton se aage badhkar tha'' kyonki vah saamaanya niyamit prakriya ke taur par bhi aage ja saktaa tha
 Opposition leaders were equally upset over the Kashmir issue
 kai aalochak jis baat se gahari niraashaa jaahir karte hai, vah yah thi ki lambit masalon ko nibatane ke saath-saath sanyukt (compojit) baatcheet kii phir se shuruyaat ke kisi sanket kaa bhi koi zikr nahin tha
 Many Indian TV analysts, who are beating up Modi's diplomatic success, added to these sentiments
 in tippaniyon se is dharna ko majbootee mili ki baithak ke baad kaa bayaan puri tarah se ekatarfa tha
 Former Pakistan High Commissioner to India Ashraf Jahangir Qazi declared, "the joint statement was a non-urgent tragedy
" ''isliye yakeenan upha baithak ne phir se sharif ko baikfoot par dhakel diya he
 Despite this, there is no indication from their side that they are considering bowing back from criticism
 unka yakeen shaayad is par tikaa he ki unki sarkaar rajnatik rup se pichley saal kii tulana main is samay kahin zyada sthir he
 The government has already recovered from the crisis posed by the siege of Islamabad, the capital of supporters of Imran Khan and Maulvi Tahirul, last year
 punjab soobe main zyaadaatar upachunaav main pakistan muslim lig (en) kii kamyaabi se bhi sarkaar kii sthiti majboot hui he
 The economy also appears to be stagnant, although the boom is yet to take place
 lagbhag chaar fisadi kii aarthik vikaas dar pichley chah saal main sarvaadhik he or mudrasphiti bhi aath saal ke nunatam str par he
 Pakistan's growing economic relations with China and the $ 46 billion Chinese investment agreement in infrastructural development have further enhanced Sharif's public standing
 is bich aatankwaadi hamalon main jaahiri giravat ai he or uttari wajiristaan main taliban baagiyon ke khilaaf chal rahaa sainya abhiyaan bhi antim charan main he
 Because of this, the terrorists have failed to commit any major incident by targeting the security bases
 haal ke maheenon main afghanistan ke saath pakistan ke rishton main bhi ullekhneey sudhaar hua he jisase hukumat par se dabaav or kam hua he
 Pakistan also hosted historic direct talks between Taliban representatives and Afghan government officials, raising hopes of an effective peace dialogue between the two sides
 ahm yah he ki sena ke saath sharif ke rishte pichley saal kii tulana main kahin behatar hai
 Of course, one of the reasons for this is the government's decision not to prosecute General Pervez Musharraf for treason, which was actually a major cause of tension with the military leadership
 badi baat yah he ki donon paksh ek-duusare ko jagah de rahe hai
 It is true that Sharif has bowed himself more but the army has also kept itself out of the game of political power
 yakeenan jab desh ko baghawat kii sthiti or aatankwaadi khatre kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa ho to aantarik suraksha main sena kii bhi ahm bhoomika ho jaati he
 For a long time the military has been playing a decisive role in important aspects of security and foreign policy
 yah bhi ek myth hi he ki naagarik sarkaar kii in nitiyon ko banane main koi bhoomika nahin hoti
 It is true that when it comes to policy in the case of India, it is necessary to take the army along and Sharif should have taken the top commanders of the army into confidence on the Ufa meeting
 yakeenan, nazariye main thodaa matbhed ab bhi ho saktaa he, lekin sena rishton ko saamaanya banane kii aisi kisi bhi prakriya main koi adnga nahin lagaaegi jisase tanaav kam ho or usko badhate aatankwaad par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa mauka mil sake
 And then we must not forget that it was Musharraf who was the architect of Kargil's war who in 2004 carried forward the peace process with India
 kashmir ke mudde par koi anya pakistani netaa itnaa lacheelaapan nahin dikhaa saktaa tha jitna ek sainya shaasha ne dikhaaya tha
 There is no doubt that the terrorist attacks on Mumbai reversed that process, but there is always a chance to move forward
 sanyukt bayaan par ho rahi aalochanaon se pare, is baat par to sabhi pramukh dalon main aam sahmati he ki donon deshon ke liye is gatirodh se baahar aane kaa ekmaatr rasta baatcheet kaa hi he
 If India takes one step forward, Sharif is ready to come two steps ahead
 donon hi deshon ke liye zyada sarthak baatcheet kii disha main badaae kii jarurat he
 Much will also depend on how much progress is made towards reopening the negotiations to focus on the commitments made in Ufa and the main source of tension between the two countries

 Conversation with Vishal Singh, Chief Executive Officer of Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust - Why is the Vishwanath Mandir Corridor Scheme being opposed? baaki aise log hai jo behad maamuli kiraye par bhawanon main rah rahe hai
 There is a lot of illegal occupation
 yahi log virodh kar rahe hai
 - Where will the illegal occupants go for a long time? - The idea is to give compensation to the illegal occupants also
 -prashasan par mandiron ko todgaye kaa aarope lag rahaa he?-prashasan kisi bhi mandir ko nahin tod rahaa he
 To bring the temples to their original form, the encroachment of the surroundings is being removed by freeing them from illegal occupants
 -yah kaise pataa chalegaa ki koun vaid he or koun avaidh?-iske liye ek team he jo survey kar rahi he
 Even if a man claims 10-11 shops, we will be able to give him only one shop
 -bhoomi kaa adhigrahan tay seemaa par nahin ho paaya?-kuch dikkaton ke chalate adhigrahan kii karrwai dhimi he
 Efforts are on to acquire the land required for the scheme by the end of the year
 yojana main koi bada nirmaan kaary nahin hona he
 The temple complex will be enlarged
 -vivaad se yojana teji nahin pakad paa rahi?-virodh ko dekhte hue 'special aria deveopment athurity' (sada) kaa gathan kiya ja rahaa he
 There will be an autonomous institution here
 'sada' hi coridor yojana ke vikaas ke liye puri tarah jimmedaar hoga
 -the Act of Temple Trust is also 35 years old? -new Act is ready
 is par adhyadesh aana he
 In this, the powers of the Chief Executive Officer will increase
 isse mandir parisar main yojanaon ko tej gati se lagu kiya ja sakegaa
 Some people associated with the temple do not want a transparent system, so they are protesting
 -mandir se jude kuch pujari gadabadi main lipt mili hai?-kuch log doodh kii jagah shraddhaluon ko chooney kaa pani bech rahe hai
 The temple is being damaged by offering it
 un par karrwai ho rahi he
 -trust treasures are not even audited? -the money of the temple trust has never been counted for the last 16 years
 maine pehali baar paisa ginvaaya
 The trust has a quarter and a half crore
 hai
 i have recommended the CAG of India to be audited

 Aam Aadmi Party's big argument behind not giving BJP a chance to form a government is that after the result of Delhi elections last year when no party got majority
 tab sabase badi party ke baavjood tatkaaleen dilli bijepi adhyaksh harshavardhan ne uparajyapal najeeb jang ko chitthee likhi thi or bahumat naa milane kaa hawala dekar sarkaar banane main asamarthta jataai thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that if the BJP gets an invitation to form the government in Delhi, it will give a boost to the horse trading of mlas
 aise main aam aadmi party dilli main bijepi sarkaar banavaane kii kisi bhi koshish kaa virodh karegi
 It is difficult for BJP to get majority
 BJP has 3 mps out of 31 mlas
 aise main 70 siton vaali vidhansabha kii takat ghatakar 67 ho gai he
 That means 34 would be the majority figure
 shiromani akali dal ke 1 vidhayak ko milakar bijepi ke paas 29 vidhayak hai
 If the Aam Aadmi Party issues a whip, then the membership of its mlas who vote in favor of the BJP will be canceled
 haalanki do tihaai sadsy (18) ne bijepi ke liye vot daalaa to sadsyta radd nahin hogi
 Similarly, 6 out of 8 Congress mlas will have to vote in favor of BJP
 yah sambhav hota nahin dikh rahaa
 If you and some Congress mlas fall ill and do not participate in voting, then the matter can be made
 kya gopneey matdaan se dilli main banegi sarkaar?chunki dilli main koi dal sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he
 Due to the defection law, no MLA can afford to go away from the party line and support another party, hence secret voting is considered a better option to form a government
 iske liye uparajyapal najeeb jang ko apane vishesh adhikaar kaa upyog karnaa hoga jo unhen dilli ensiti act ke jariye sansad se mila he
 Under this authority, the Lt
 Governor can call a special session of the Legislative Assembly for a one-point agenda
 wo sadan ko sambodhit kar sakate hai
 They can order the assembly to elect their leader through secret ballot
 sadan kii sahmati ho to uparajyapal ke aadesh par spikar ko gupt matdaan karana padegaa
 According to the NCT Act, political parties can issue a whip to vote in favor of their candidate
 lekin gupt matdaan kii surat main vip kaa phayda siyaasi partiyon ko mil paayegaa isamen shaq he
 An interesting aspect of this whole political game is that despite fewer seats, BJP is said to be ready for secret ballot
 lekin apane vidhayak dheer singh ke vidhansabha adhyaksh hone ke baavjood aam aadmi party kadam khinch rahi he
 In the political corridors before the Supreme Court hearing, there is also a lot of discussion in the political corridors that this drama is happening only for the September 9 hearing in the Supreme Court
 sutron kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar chaahati he ki dilli main sarkaar bane yaa naa bane, lekin apni bhagdaud ke bare main supreme court main joardaar jawaab de diya jaae
 Once this work is done, then you will think of holding elections by December January
 tab tak haryana or maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey bhi aa jaaenge or hawa kaa rukh pataa chal jayega
 Meanwhile, by-elections will be held in the three vacant seats of Delhi Assembly in November
 yani litmus test ke kai maukey saamne hai
 Current state of the assembly The BJP has 28 mlas in the 70-member Assembly in Delhi
 bijepi ne 31 siten jiti thim par party ke teen vidhayak dow
 Harshvardhan, Ramesh Bidhuri and Pravesh Verma were elected to the Lok Sabha and had to give up their assembly seats
 aam aadmi party ko vidhansabha ke apane pehle chunaavon main hi 28 siten hasil hui thim or usne congress ke aath vidhayakon ke bahari samarthan se dilli main sarkaar bana lee thi

 raajnneetik galiyaaron se baahar piem narendra modi kii notebook main apni jagah banane ke liye varun gandhi har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai
 Usually 39-year-old BJP candidate Varun Gandhi refrains from criticizing his cousins rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, but while talking to "india Today", he said that Rahul cannot compete with Modi, adding That Rahul Gandhi cannot become Prime Minister for two decades to come
 jab unase poocha gaya ki rahul gandhi piem ummidavaar ke yogya hai, is par unhone kaha ki main koi jyotishi nahin hum, lekin mujhe lagata he ki 10-20 saalon tak sambhav nahin he
 Also, when Varun was asked if his cousins could compete with Prime Minister Modi, he said that voters would not accept him for the higher post
 uttar pradesh ke pilibhit loksabhaa seat se bijepi ummidavaar varun gandhi hai
 He told "india Today" that the country has made up its mind and they are ready to give Modiji not only votes but also his blood
 unhone rahul-priyanka ke saath rishton ko lekar kaha ki, hamaara rishta shishtachar kaa he, lekin aupchaarik
