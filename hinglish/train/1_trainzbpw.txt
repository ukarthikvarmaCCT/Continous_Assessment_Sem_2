 There is still about a year to go for the Lok Sabha elections, but the furore over the nda's prime ministerial candidate does not seem to stop
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ko lekar shanivaar or ravivaar ko jediu kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak dilli main hone vaali he
 Even though this meeting is going to be held in Delhi, it is believed that the decisions taken in it can bring a change in the politics of Delhi as well as in the politics of Bihar
 yahi kaaran he ki endie kii mukhya ghatak bijepi sahit anya vipakshi dalon kii bhi nigahen is baithak par lagi hui hai
 Opposition parties are giving a lot of importance to the statement of JDU leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in which he had said to declare a leader of secular image as the prime ministerial candidate
 argedy haalanki na to bijepi ke laalkrishna adwani or na hi narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar maanata he
 RJD general secretary and MP Ramkripal Yadav said that Nitish is referring to a leader with a secular image, but he is calling Advani a good leader who is pushing the entire nation in the fire of communalism
 jediu kii hone vaali baithak main nitish kii hakeekat saamne aa jaaegi
 When asked about the JDU meeting, BJP leader and Bihar minister Giriraj Singh said, "it is not a hide and seek game of boys and girls
" abhi tak jediu sabake saamne bijepi se milakar sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Whatever decision will be taken in the meeting will be in front of everyone
 vaise abhi koi jaldbaaji nahin he
 As of now, no party has decided a prime ministerial candidate
 aise main itani jaldbaaji nahin kii jaani chahie
 On the other hand, Congress leader Umakant Singh said that if Nitish leaves BJP and goes to fight against communal forces, a new political equation will be considered
 unhone kaha ki abhi nitish sampradayik shaktiyon ke saath hai
 It is to be seen what happens in the meeting to be held in Delhi
 is bich, jediu ke ek netaa ne kaha ki baithak main party bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ko yah saaf sandesh de sakati he ki vah pradhanmantri pad ke liye kisi sampradayik chhavi vaale vyakti ko sweekaar nahin karegi
 Many JDU leaders have made it clear on various occasions that Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is not acceptable to them as prime ministerial candidate
 endie kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main puche jane par nitish ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki sab kuch shanivaar or ravivaar ko dilli main hone vaali jediu kii baithak main tay hoga

 dalit netaa prabhudayal kaa kahana he ki, 'aam aadmi party ke netaashutoshne gandhi ji ke parivaar par aarope laga die, jise ham sahi nahin maanate
 The Dalit society demands that Ashutosh and Sandeep Kumar be expelled from the party
 'sandip kumaar ke khilaaf pradarshanmahilapradarshnakariyon kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi kii tarah sandip kumaar ko sajaa mili
 For such work, soot should be placed on the mouth of Arvind Kejriwal
 dalit samaaj ke mutabik arvind kejariwal ko naitikta ke aadhaar par istipha dena chahie, kyonki wo aise mantri kaa chayan dilli sarkaar main karte hai, jo ashleel harakat karata he
 The people of entire Delhi are ashamed and after Sandeep Kumar has mixed the name of Dalits in the soil, then the whole society boycott them

 Name- Sudhir Kumar Makkar aka Golden Baba Age- 54 years ago- Mahant, Panchadashnam Juna Akhara, Barelibaba's life is such a big box of contradiction, this Baba's identity itself tells us
 kehane ko to baba mahant hai, akhaada chalaate hai
 Live the life of saints
 lekin in baba kaa bhi ek ateet he
 This past belongs to that trade of Baba
 jisaki aad main gunaah karne kaa
 But this is probably the specialty of Baba that Baba has not only committed the crime, but has also lied with open heart
 baba purvi dilli ke puraane historishiter hai
 When the history sheet was spoken, the book of Baba's name was opened in the police station, in which the accounts of all his small and big crimes are recorded
 or kisi bhi shaks ke naam police historishiter tabhi taiyaar karti he, jab police ko ye yakeen ho jaataa he ki ye shaks sudhar nahin saktaa or ye shaks ke adatan apradhi he
 That is, there is something similar with your Golden Baba from professional wrongdoing and coincidence
 golden baba ke khilaaf kareeb 3 darjan mukademevaise bhi baba gunahon kii duniya main kisi thor rakhte hai, iskaa andaja bas isi ek baat se lag jaataa he ki is vakt bhi baba ke khilaaf har tarah gunahon ke takreeban teen darjan mukademe alag-alag adaalaton main chal rahe hai or in mukademon main apharan, phiroti, jabaran vasuuli, marpet, jaan se maarane kii dhamkee jaise tamaam chote-bade gunaah shaamil hai
 Today, Golden Baba undoubtedly roams on his body with crores of jewels, wears gold rings on every finger and sometimes even entertains himself with a gold shirt, but Golden Baba also used to throw him away
 aise main ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki kodiyon se shuru kar karodon main khilne tak ke baba ke safar main baba ne kaise-kaise gul khilaae honge or kaise itani daulat ikattha kii hogi
 Golden Babadar used to work as a tailor
 Actually, Baba is a resident of Gandhinagar area of east Delhi, in the same Gandhinagar where there is a good work of clothes and once used to tailor the same cloth market of Baba Gandhi Nagar
 lekin baba ko jaanane vaale log bataate hai ki baba ke armaan shuru se hi kaaphi bade the
 Soon Baba changed the track and Baba kept working the property for a few days
 lekin isi bich ek roj baba antardhyaan ho gaye or sidhe haridwar main ja based
 Then when he returned from there, a new avatar of Baba had appeared
 ab dhandha pani chhod kar baba kaa manbabagirimen lag chukaa tha
 Baba got a temple built in Gandhinagar and gradually converted it into an ashram and became a Mahant himself
 lekin mahant banane ke baavjood sone kii chamak baba ko lubhaati rahi
 Even if Baba used to donate for the ashram, it was in the form of gold, and in the same way, Baba made so much gold that this gold made Baba a Golden Baba overnight

 Hafiz Saeed wants to use the death of Kashmiri youths with Pakistani intelligence agency ISI to fulfill his nefarious plans
 ek taraf wo surakshabalon ke khilaaf hinsaatmak pradarshan karne ke liye uksaata he or duusari taraf unhen aazaadee ke sapane dikhaa kar gumraah kar rahaa he

 But, the way Hafiz Saeed is plotting to spread terrorism in India and Kashmir, it proves that Pakistan is misleading the world

 The king ordered his idol from Ayodhya, the birthplace of Shri Ram, and kept it in the palace until the temple was built

 Thus the palace itself was made a temple of Lord Rama

 Once there was a country girl who dreamt of being a princess, she made tiny stories in her head playing in her own company about a prince who would come on a horse and take her far away, as time went by she grew up and went to the city the girl realised that the world we live in is not kind to princesses and every girl needed to become her own hero to survive, to fight the competition at work, to fight for her identity every step despite her million achievements, to work like a man and to love like a dog she has to not stop despite what life may throw at her
 So the girl wiped her own tears and fought the battle , she ran and climbed and fell and stood up and ran and conquered ,till she became a Queen 
 She did the impossible and faced the unheard and reigned supreme, and then again it was life's turn to show her that she is just a small town girl and not a powerful queen, so life played its most devilish card and took her beloved father away, the man who was her inspiration to live, the man who's language she spoke and the world applauded her, he was her hero and her hero was gone
 The girl lost all desire to fight, the colors seems to fade away and all lacked lustre 
 Then her hero from the sky sent her a prayer, he sent her a blessing, there came a country boy, raw and rustic, tanned skinned scar faced, with his childlike innocence and his calming maturity he fit into her being like a jigsaw puzzle, he loved her and healed her broken heart, he gave her so much love that all her broken pieces joined back together, he made her feel beautiful everyday and never let her shed a tear again
 You know what happened to the girl ? She became a Princess üë∏, because a woman becomes a reflection of what her man thinks of her, she became a princess as she knew her protector has come

 This is the first time in telecom history when the salary of BSNL employees is stuck
 ab tak karmchaariyon ko har maheene ke aakhri yaa agle maheene ke pehle varking de tak selary mil jaati thi
 According to English newspaper Times of India, this condition of BSNL is the price war of private telecom companies

 It constitutes 55 percent of the company's total revenue
 jabaki har saal is bajet main 8 fisadi kii badhottaree ho jaati he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Myanmar, considered a master of diplomacy, has increased China's tension
 dilachasp baat yah he ki vah china main yojit bricks summit main hissaa lene ke baad sidhe myanmar pahunche hai
 On 16 August 2017, China's official newspaper Global Times expressed deep concern over the growing proximity between India and Myanmar
 chini akhbaar ne kaha tha ki bharat apni act east policy ke jariye myanmar main china ke prabhaav ko kam karnaa chahta he
 However, this time China has kept silence on this
 philhal uski ore se is babat koi virdohi pratikriya nahin ai he
 If i look at history, Myanmar has been closer to China than India
 jahaan bharat or myanmar ke bich dwipaksheeya vyapaar kareeb 2
 2 billion dollars, while bilateral trade between China and Myanmar total 9
 5 arab dollar kaa he
 Bilateral trade between the two countries has been $ 6 billion in 2016-2017 alone

 It is clear that Myanmar is closer to China than India
 haalanki bharat or myanmar ke bich 1,642 kimi kii seemaa he
 Apart from this, the maritime boundaries of both countries are also found in the Bay of Bengal

 However, after Prime Minister Narendra came to power, the relationship between the two countries started a new beginning
 piem modi ne myanmar ko bharat kii act east policy kaa ahm pillar qaraar diya
 The purpose of this Act East Policy is to strengthen India's economic and strategic relations with Southeast ASEAN countries
 myanmarek aisa asian desh hai, jisaki jamini seemaa bharat se milti he
 Hence Myanmar is called the Gateway to ASEAN of India
 ang saan su kii ke satta main aane ke badbhaarat-myanmarrishte kii nai shuruyatang saan su kii sarkaar se pehle myanmar main sainya sarkaar thi, jiske china se gahare rishte the
 Meanwhile, China has deep roots in Myanmar
 su kii ke satta main aane ke baad bharat or myanmar ke bich rishte behadtar hone kii ummid badi
 The reason for this was that Suu Kyi was educated in India only
 unako bharat samarthak mana jaataa he
 However, after coming to power, Suu Kyi also visited China before India
 iske chalate mana ja rahaa tha ki myanmar main china ne majboot paith bana lee he
 So it is difficult for India to gain a foothold there, but the Modi government understood the importance of the neighboring country Myanmar and offered it defense support
 isse china tilamila gaya or chini akhbaar ne is par tikhi pratikriya di
 China said that India has made this proposal to beat China in Myanmar

 She talks about the honor of women to the leaders of the opposition, but has given her leaders and mlas-mps a free hand to harass the women
 ek taraf 'bijepi beti bachaao-beti padhaao' kaa naaraa detii he to duusari taraf bijepi ke netaa or vidhayak mahilaon kii izzat kaa tamaasha bana rahe hai
 Sajan says that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, accused in such a big case, is still a member and MLA of BJP
 bijepi ne uske khilaaf kisi tarah kii koi karrwai nahin kii he
 While he is accused of raping a girl and killing the victim's father
 yahi nahin unnav ke saansad chunaav jeetne ke baad jail main band balaatkaar ke aaropee kuldeep singh senger ko dhanyavad dene jate hai
 The bjp's double character can be understood from this
 sapa netaa ne kaha ki bijepi netaa mahila sammaan kii baat kehete hai lekin unheen kaa ek vidhayak par balaatkaar kaa aarope he
 We do not take any action regarding this
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi ke netaa sadan main mahila ko jersey gaay bolte hai or sab maun rahete hai
 The BJP hopes for female dignity but not from the leaders of its own party but from the leaders of other parties
 yahi vajah he ki aaj tak bijepi kuldeep singh senger ke khilaaf kisi tarah kii koi karrwai nahin kii
 Let us tell you that the BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar was accused in the Unnao rape case
 jab yah maamla saamne aayaa tha to bijepi ne unnav maamle ko lekar maun dhaaran kar liya tha
 BJP leaders had not even opened their tongue on this matter
 bijepi ke kai vidhayak to khuleam aaropee kuldeep singh senger ke paksh main khadey najar aa rahe the
 He was giving a statement against the victim itself
 isi main ek vidhayak surendra singh hai jinhone kaha tha ki teen bacchon kii maa ke saath kahin koi balaatkaar karata he
 On 17 April 2017, a 17-year-old minor girl is kidnapped in Makhi village, 15 km from Unnao
 ladki gangrape kaa aarope makhi gaanv ke hi rahane vaale bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger par lagaati he
 Being an MLA from the ruling party, the police in this case instead of taking action against the accused, puts the victim's father in jail
 peedita siem yogi ke awaas ke baahar aatmadah karne kii koshish karti he
 After this, the victim's father dies in police custody
 ab unnav balaatkaar peedita ke vakil, mausi or chachee haadase kii shikaar ho jaati hai
 The victim's aunt and aunt died in the accident
 jabaki peedita or uske vakil kii haalat gambhir bani hui he

 kedarnath main ai baadh ke baad adaalat ke aadesh ke tahat jin baandhon ke nirmaan kaa kaam turant roak diya gaya tha, unamem se kuch ko hari jhandi dene ke liye centre sarkaar supreme court main apil kar sakati he
 The central government will soon have to give an affidavit in the court, in which the government's decision on the dams will be decided
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar kii banaai ek export cameti pehle hi in baandhon par sawaal khadaa kar chuki he
 a meeting of the 'national Ganga River Basin Authority' was held on Thursday under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar adaalat main is tarah kaa halafanama de sakati he, jisase roke gaye baandhon main kuch kaa kaam shuru karne kii anumati mil sake
 The current government of Uttarakhand is also not in favor of stopping construction of dams
 is meeting main pradhanmantri se baat karne ke baad uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne kaha ki hamane un baandhon kaa nirmaan shuru karaane ke liye kaha he jo bahut zaruri hai
 Significantly, after the 2013 floods in Kedarnath and the devastation caused in the state, the court had asked to study what role these dams had in this ruin
 centre ne pehle adaalat main ye sweekaar kiya ki tabaahi main in baandhon kii pratyaksh or apratyaksh bhoomika thi, lekin baad main usne apana rukh badal liya
 At present, several dams are under construction in the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins of Uttarakhand, on which it has been questioned that due to these, no scientific study was done on the environment and the impact on Uttarakhand's rivers and life
 2014 main sarkaar kii export cameti ke zyaadaatar sadasyon ne baandhon ke khilaaf report di thi, lekin rajya ke mukhyamantri harish ravat ne enditivi india se kaha ki kuch logon ke kehane par yaa virodh karne se vikaas kii pariyojnaayen nahin roki ja sakati
 He says that dams like Tehri have helped prevent destruction
 udhar jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne is bare main koi bayaan dene se inkaar kar diya
 She simply said that the matter is sub judice and she cannot say anything on it
 saat bacchon kii maa jaaraa ko nahin pataa kii jab uske bachche khaane ke bare main poochhate hai, to vah unase kya kahe
 Zara, who is wearing a blue burqa, said that i usually tell her that we should wait till her father comes with something

 iaiti dilli main pichley dinon ek student ne suicide kar liya th or is khabar se ek baar phir bacchon par lagaataar padhai ke pressure kii baat uthne lagi thi
 The children spend 3 to 4 years of hard work and coaching for IIT entrance
 uske baad bhi kuch bachche hi is sabase kathin pariksha ko paas kar iaiti campus main entry kar pate hai
 UPES is starting three new vocational courses, this way, but even after leaving the campus, there is a constant pressure on projects and examinations on children
 vahiin isi pressure ke chalate bachche kai baar galat kadam uthaa lete hai
 In order to reduce the pressure of children a little, IIT Delhi has thought of revamping the curriculum for its first year
 ve ram gopal raav, diarector ai ai tii dilli ne hame bataaya ki bacchon ko first year main practical practices prowide karne ke liye baat chal rahi hai taaki campus main aane ke baad bachche thodaa relax kar padhai ko enjoy kar sake
 Children are kept engrossed in books and notes for 3 to 4 years to remove entrance
 lekin campus main jane baad bhi unhen koi raahat nahi milti jiskaa anjaam pressure or stress ke rup main har pal unhen jhelana padataa hai
 AP SSC 10th Board: Check result like this
 
 
 koching se shuru hua pressure or padhai kaa silsilaa baccha har pal jhelta rahata hai
 It is not possible for every student to handle this stress and perhaps this is the reason why 8 students are sueded every hour in our country
 iaiti ke first year karikulam main badlaav karne kii raah par chalata iaiti dilli bacchon ko kitabon or sawaalon se hataa kar practical padhai kii taraf le jane kii soch rahaa hai
 
 
 
 wo jinhone kabhi nahin kii naukari, par mazdooron ke liye thi buland aawazlekin suicide karne kii peeche kii maansikta agar sirf padhai yaa koi pariksha hai to vaaki us system ko badalane kii zarurat hai
 According to doctors, there is not only one reason behind suicide, that is why if a student does suicide then there are other things besides the pressure of studies
 bade imtihaanon main top karne vaale bachche or fail hone vaale baccho main sirf itnaa hi fark hota hai ki ek pressure ko handle karke padhai karata hai or doosraa pressure main rahakar padhai karata hai ab aise main bacchon ko bade imtihaanon kii taiyaari ke saath saath zindagi ke utaar-chadhaav , haar-jeet ko jhelane kii taiyaari bhi karwaani chahie

 The RSS has said in an editorial in its mouthpiece, 'the media ignored Russian President Putin's visit
 vah 24 ghante kii bharat yatra par the or unka ekmaatr agenda hathiyaaron kaa bada sauda karnaa tha
 Most Indians were unaware that the deal was worth about three billion dollars
 ‚Äô sampadakeey ke anusaar rus ke saath hastakshar kiye gaye hathiyaaron ke saude ke bare main sarkaar ne abhi tak koi aadhikarik bayaan nahin diya he
 The RSS alleged that the media did not make a comprehensive reporting of his visit and the government acted to divert attention from the issue

 It is said that during the investigation Christian Michel, an accused in the agustawestland case, referred to "mrs
 Gandhi" and "son of an Italian woman"
 bhaajapa ne aarope lagaaya ki ab sach saamne aa rahaa he
 The Congress also cited Mitchell's statements before his extradition in which he alleged that Indian investigative agencies were pressurizing him to name a member of the Gandhi family and alleged that it was a "fix match"
 party pravaktaa tom vadakkan ne kaha ki mishael ne pratyrpan se pehle ‚Äò‚Äòadaalat main kaha tha ki us par yah dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he ki vah gandhi parivaar main se kisi sadsy kaa naam le or isi kaaran ve sajeesh rach rahe the or isamen ve kaamyaab bhi hue
 "wadakkan said," The motive is clear and what he said was pre-decided and so happened
 yah nishchit rup se ek fiks match he, jiskaa uddeshy gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf kuch aarope lagaana he
 Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad also targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 prasad ne gandhi par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main apshabd kehane kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki adaalat main pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke bayaan ke baad ‚Äò‚Äòaaj samay he gandhi parivaar spashtikaran de
 The Congress rejected the allegation, saying that the central government was using agencies to implicate the Gandhi family
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki is maamle main giraftaar bichauliye mishael kaa bayaan ek parivaar kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 He claimed that this family has now been caught
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòadaalat main idi ke khulaase ne spasht kar diya he ki sach ko ab nahin dabaaya ja saktaa
 The truth about Congress, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul is coming to the public
 janata congress ko karaara jawaab degi
 Javadekar said that the country was aware of the first two words "family" and "AP" about the VVIP helicopter case, but Mitchell has now "mrs Gandhi" "son of Italian woman" "elder" "R
 By mentioning ', some other names have been taken
 prasad ne daawa kiya ki mishael is maamle main bahut ahm vyakti tha jo tay nirvaasan prakriya ke baad bharat laayaa gaya
 He claimed, "he has taken the name of Sonia ji and has given hints about Rahul Gandhi in a chit to his lawyer

 Today is the time for the Gandhi family to respond
 jahaan tak congress kii baat he to koi bhi sauda kisi ‚Äòsaude' ke bina puraa nahin hota
 Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi should clarify his position on Mitchell's statement
 congress dwaara sarkaar par gandhi parivaar ko fansaane ke liye jaanch agenciyon par dabaav daalane kaa aarope lagane par, prasad ne daawa kiya ki congress ne unhen kaid kar rakhaa tha lekin ab ve nishpaksh jaanch kar paa rahi hai
 Javadekar accused the Congress of "looting" the country and compromising national security

 a major negligence of Greater Noida Police of Uttar Pradesh has been revealed
 beete dinon police ne oparation clin abhiyaan chalaakar bina vija rah rahe 60 videshi nagarikon ko pakadaa tha
 But on Thursday, ten of these prisoners escaped
 jiske baad noida police ne is puure maamle main chuppi saadh rakhi he
 The case belongs to the Greater Noida Police Line
 jahaan se bina vija rah rahe 10 videshi naagarik bathroom kii khidki todakar faraar ho gaye
 Ten of the ten escaped prisoners are of Nigerian origin
 vahiin is maamle main noida police kuch bhi bolne se batch rahi he
 Under Operation Clean Campaign-10 of Greater Noida Police, a large number of police forces had checked the visas and other documents of all foreign origin people living in noida-greater Noida border
 inamen se 60 videshi nagarikon ke dastavejon main gadabadi pai gai
 Apart from this, he did not even get a visa
 police ke jariye kii gai karrwai main 32 purush or 28 mahilaayein thi
 They were all kept in the police line
 jisamen se 10 kaidi police ko chakma dekar faraar ho gaye he
 At the same time, the police is not making any statement regarding this whole matter and the media is not even being allowed to enter the police line
 oparation clinabta den ki noida police beete kai dinon se lagaataar abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 This campaign has been named Operation Clean
 is abhiyaan main police roj alag-alag prakaar ke aparaadhon par ek saath drive chalaati he
 Recently, Noida Police conducted a school bus checking campaign
 iske tahat police kii team ne skool bason or vine main suraksha maanakon kii checking kii thi
 Such a campaign of the police is being highly appreciated
 yah abhiyaan subah 6 baje se der raat tak chalaaya ja rahaa he
 But due to the escape of 10 prisoners, the police is also getting into the nitty gritty
 yah sawaal bahes ke laayak thah kya sarkaar ko kisi sankat ko rokane ke liye jhtapat koi ehtiyaati kadam uthaanaa chahie; yaa phir intjaar karne kii samajhadaari dikhaani chahie, apana vakt lenaa chahie or dekhnaa chahie ki kya sankat aapke daravaaje par aate aate kisi khai main girakar aapkaa rasta hamvaar kar degaa? neuyork main ek dostana lunch ke dauraan yah baatcheet kahiraa ke taharir skhwaayar ke sandarbh main ho rahi thi, lekin badi aasaani se yah sandarbh dilli kaa jantar mantar bhi ho saktaa tha
 Long experience of power has taught Congress to wait
 dhiredhire kaaphi kuch ho saktaa he
 An air of challenge can come out, invisible forces may lead him astray, unnatural leadership may cause him to break
 jab kaamchalaoo jugat se hi kaam nikal jaataa ho to dirghakaalik ranneeti kyon banaai jaae?sheersh par baithe log nunatam maukhik dakhal tak khud ko simit rakhte hai, hangaamaa machaane kaa kaam bich kii paant ke un netaaon ke jimme chhod dete hai, jinhen ek jatke main nakaara ja saktaa haih aise mantri jinamein khaas rajnatik dam na ho, yaa asahaay pravaktaa jinhen hawa main ganth baandhne kii kala sikhaai jaati he
 Who will listen when you speak everyday? And if anyone listens, who remembers it? Time is usually a companion of the government
 sarkaar shant haathiyon kii chaal chalanaa pasand karti he; or congress aisa hathi he jisaki yaaddaasht badi tej he, jo badabade dag bharta he, sansthagat tareeke se bartaav karata he, or jisamen mauka milane par apane dushman kii khopadi bedadak kuchalane kii aniatik kshamta he
 But what if an elephant like this slips on a banana peel? Is it a joke or a tragedy? It is probably both for the ruthless spectator who has a permanent pass of the Rangbhoomi, and that audience is the voter
 bhale hi vah hathi phir apane pairon par khadaa ho jaae parauski maryaada to gai hi, uske gaurav kii bhi hawa nikal jaati he
 The UPA government is particularly sloppy, it was inviting the group of bananas repeatedly as if one or two might not be enough to slip its heavy steps
 uski ghaatak chook yah thi ki usne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bharat ke gusse ke bare main puri tarah galat andaaj laga liya
 He dismissed the challenge as another juggle of the ravaged opposition, or even more so, as a right-wing Vetal that taps behind the national psyche
 usne thik usee tarah sarkaar samarthak tatwon ko is kaalpanik shadyantr ke khilaaf 'aa'aa karne ko uksaaya jaisaa usne kareeb chaar dashak pehle jaiprakash narayan ke maamle main kiya tha
 The roar echoing across the country is the voice of the public, not of any political party

 agar aapane khud ko unke anusaar badal diya, to aapaki shakhsiyat unhen prabhavit hi nahin kar paaegi
 Because your real face will not come in front of them
 aap donon ko milte hue bhale hi jamaana guzar gaya ho, lekin apni har mulaakaat kaa pehali mulaakaat kii hi tarah se anand uthaaen, taaki aapke saathi ko yah mahasoos na ho ki aap unke saath ko enjvaay nahin karatin
 In the early days of dating, give your friends the same amount of time and attention that you give to your partner
 unki baaten aapako thes pahunchaati hai, to bhi rishta khatm karne yaa badlaav jaisi baton ko man main na laaen
 Actually, when women start thinking from the heart, they take the matter to heart
 lekin shuruaati daur main jaraa sa intjaar behatar vikalp he
 In at least three months, you cannot be angry with them for trivial matters
 do agal alag logon kii pasand bhi alag ho sakati he, isliye agar aapako unki koyee cheez yaa baat pasand nahin he, to chup rahane ke bajaae yah baat unhen bataaen
 He may not be aware of that deficiency and improve upon it
 aap unhen apana dil de chuki hai or unke saath jivan bhar rahane kaa irata bana chuki hai, to ab vakt aa gaya he ki aap unase vaade karne lagen
 If he refrains from making promises, give him an example of couples he has met and who are happy with each other
 yakeen maniye iske baad vah sahajata se aapke saath vaadon kii door main bandha sakenge

 Former Team India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels that the pace bowler Mohammed Shamiko, who is suffering from injuries, is a bit risky to join the Indian team for the World T20 but he said that the team announced on Friday has a 'balance of wonders'
 shami ko australia kaa daura karne vaali team main shaamil kiya gaya tha lekin chot ke kaaran unhen ek bhi gend phenke bina daure se waapas lautnaa padaa
 His selection will also depend on fitness for the World T20 Championship to be held from March 8 to April 3

 Although this format is short (he can throw four overs)
 world tii20 ke liye ek maheene se adhik kaa samay bachaa he or asia cap main bhi uske gendbaaji kaa kaaphi mauka milegaa
 Gavaskar said that the inclusion of Shami and left-arm spinner Pawan Negi would strengthen the team overall but he also wanted a leg-spinner
 of spinner ravichandran aswin or baayen haath ke spinner ravindra jadeja team ke liye mukhya spin jodi hogi
 Gavaskar said, "this is a good team, i believe the leg-spinner would have given more options but the selectors retained the team

 On many occasions, franchises also have to pay players who report on their injury in the team camp
 ipel ke vartmaan sijan main dilli dairedevills kobhartiya tej gendbaaj mohammad shamiki sevaayen nahin lene ke baavjood apni jeb dhili kerani pad rahi he
 Shami will not be able to play for three months due to a knee injury during the World Cup
 bhugtan ko lekar niyamon main spasht he ki chotil khilaadiyon ke sambandh main vetan sambandhi niyam khilaadiyon ke paksh main hai
 It states that as soon as a player is bought in the IPL auction and he reports in the team camp, the franchise will have to pay 50 percent of the contracted amount even if he is injured and does not participate in the tournament
 ipel sanchaalan parishad ke ek sadsy ne sweekaar kiya ki dilli dairedevills ko is saal shami ko unke anubandh kaa 50 pratishat vetan (2
 12 crore)
 bina match khele shami ko milenge khub paisabisisiai ke senior adhikari or ipel sanchaalan parishad ke sadsy ne kaha, 'niyamon ke mutabik agar shami ek bhi match khele bina ipel se baahar ho jaataa he or chot ke kaaran trial match main bhi nahin khel paata he tab unhen unki anubandh raashi kaa aadha hissaa dena hoga
 So if they 4 at auction
 25 karod rupee main kharida gaya to dairedevills ko unhen isaki aadhi raashi deni hogi
 The source said, "even though Shami was injured during the World Cup but he had reported to the camp, the franchise has no choice
" unhen bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The BCCI and IPL have always been in favor of the players and i don't think this rule is going to change
 shami anubandhit khilaadi he isliye unke oparation kaa kharchaa bisisiai vahan karegaa
 'finch's case is different from Shami's case, however, quite different from Mumbai Indians opener Aaron Finch who was injured during the IPL match and then dropped out of the tournament
 sutara ne kaha, 'finch apni frenchiji se puraa bhugtan hasil karne ke hakdaar hai kyonki vah ipel match ke dauraan chotil hue the
 'the most interesting aspect though is about the trial match
 do frenchiji ke adhikariyon ke mutabik jaise hi koi khilaadi trial match main report karata he vah puure bhugtan kaa hakdaar ban jaataa he
 The franchisees do not get the full amount of insurance for the injured player
 He said, 'for example, the player knows that he is injured but what is the problem of playing in a trial match
 20 over ke match main jaise hi aapako dard hota he phir aap chaahe 10 lakh ke khilaadi ho yaa 10 karod ke yah myne nahin rakhata
 You will get full payment

 Khari Baoli market of Old Delhi is becoming increasingly digital to overcome demonetisation
 kahin petm exepted hai, to kahi debit / credit card ke jariye bhugtan ho rahaa he
 According to wholesalers, now 80 percent of buyers are cashless
 kuch dukaanon main abhi bhi kisi tarah kaa online pement opshan maujuud nahin he, lekin aise dukaanon kii sankhya behad kam he
 Cashless shops are 90% of Khari Baoli You will get different options for cashless payments in about 90% shops of Khari Baoli
 masaalon or dryfruts ke liye mashhoor asia ke sabase bade bazaar ke thok vikritaon kii maane to cashles bhugtan ko badhaava dene se bazaar ne raftaar pakadi he
 According to them, there has been no significant change in the prices of food and drink after demonetisation, but there is still a 60 percent decline in business
 darasal khaari baawali ke thok bazaar se dilli hi nahin, balki desh bhar ke khudara vyapaaree saamaan le jate hai
 But post-demonetisation retailers, who carry lump sum goods, are now giving priority to goods in need
 bhugtan karne ke liye bhi vyapaaree zyaadaatar check yaa phir net banking ko tavajjo de rahe hai
 According to Ramkishan Goyal, wholesalers of the samples, the demonetisation effect was seen in the month of November, but the market is almost normal from the second week of December
 haalanki pehle kii tarah bikri nahin ho rahi he, lekin hotel, restaurant se lekar khudara vyapaaree tak sabhi ab khaari baawali kaa rukh bejhijak kar rahe hai
 One reason for this is the digitalisation of Khari Baoli businessmen
 deyari product teders association ke adhyaksh ashok arora ne bataaya ki jaruri chizon ke thok bazaar par notebandi kaa asar kam dikhaa he
 In the beginning, Khari Baoli market was also stalled
 lekin ab logon kii jeb main paisa he, nai karansi he, lihaaja khudara vyapaaree se lekar aam public tak sabhi khaane-pine kii jaruri chijen kharid rahe hai
 Due to this, the business of Khari Baoli market is also catching up
 notebandi kaa zyada asar lakjri itms par padaa he
 Khari Baoli businessmen expect the market to pick up in the next one-and-a-half months
 mazdooron kii mushkilon kaa nahin ho rahaa halhaalanki khaari baawali bazaar kaa ek varg aisa bhi he, jo ab bhi notebandi kaa shikaar he
 Due to declining business, work for unloading workers of goods loading has reduced compared to earlier
 aise main unki maheene kii kamai bhi aadhi rah gai he
 Pappu Yadav, who runs a hand cart, said that before demonetisation, the revenue used to be 12 to 15 thousand months, but after demonetisation, the work in the market has also halved
 isliye kamai bhi lagbhag aadhi ho gai he
 According to Rajiv Batra, head of Khari Baoli Sarva Vyapar Mandal, traders and buyers are becoming cashless, but it is not easy for Khari Baoli's labor class to be cashless, as most of them do not even have bank accounts
 aise main agar thok vikreta kisi majdoor ko uskaa bhatta dena chaahe to use cash kii hi jarurat padati he, isliye puri tarah cashles hone main abhi khaari baawali ko kaaphi vakt lagegaa

 farvari main hi supreme court ne faisla sunaate hue shashikala or unke do rishtedaaron ko doshi tehraate hue chaar saal kii sajaa sunai thi, lekin jayalalita ke nidhan kii vajah se unhen alag kar diya tha, lekin karnataka sarkaar ne punarvichaar yachika main kaha tha ki supreme court main sunwaayee puri hone tak jayalalita jivit thim isliye yah faisla un par bhi lagu hona chahie or court unki sampatti jabt kar 100 karod kaa jurmaana vasuulne ke aadesh jari karen
 According to the rules - the court considers the review petition in the chamber
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main kaha ki hamane karnataka sarkaar kii yachika par merit ke aadhaar par gaur kiya
 We observed that there is no need to change the order dated 14 February 2017, hence the petition is dismissed on the basis of merit
 karnataka sarkaar ne jayalalita ko bhi doshi qaraar dene or trial court ke 100 karod ke jurmaane ko barkaraar rakhane kii maang kii thi
 In February itself, the Supreme Court, while giving the verdict, had sentenced Sasikala and two of her relatives to four years of imprisonment, but separated them due to Jayalalithaa's demise, but the Karnataka government said in a review petition that the Supreme Court Jayalalithaa was alive till the completion of the trial, so this decision should apply to them as well and the court should seize her property and recover a fine of 100 crores
 Release Order
 niyamon ke mutabik- court punarvichaar yachika par chember main vichaar karata he
 The Supreme Court said in its order that we have considered the petition of the Government of Karnataka on the basis of merit
 hamane ye paaya ki 14 farvari 2017 ke aadesh main badlaav karne kii jarurat nahin he, isliye merit ke aadhaar par yachika ko khaarij kiya jaataa he
 One, the intoxication of police uniform is such that it outweighs every drug
 phir iske upar sharaab kaa bhi nasha ho to kanoon ki dhajjiyaan udana to tay he
 a policeman guarding the law in Lucknow got so drunk that he forgot the shame of the uniform
 duty ke dauraan nashe main talli hokar usne lakhanu ke kanpur road par sthit sarojini nagar kii puraani chungi par sarerah aisa bavaal machaaya ki logon kaa majamaa lag gaya
 During this time, the policeman did not even regret that the uniform was embarrassing due to his actions
 pulicekarmi or ek anya vyakti kii aapas main guttham-gutthi dekhakar log vahaan ikattha ho gaye
 On hearing the news of the Sarerah policeman's beating, the policemen of Sarojini Nagar police station reached the spot and somehow managed to settle the matter
 lekin jis tarah se vardi sarerah beabaru hui usase police kii saakh par batta laganaa tay he
 Passers-by said that the policeman often commits a drunken stupor

 Former Prime Minister and senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh can become a Rajya Sabha candidate from Rajasthan
 bhartiya janata party ke rajasthan pradesh adhyaksh or rajyasabha sadsy madan laal saini ke nidhan ke baad rajya ke cote kii ek rajyasabha seat khaali hui he
 Regarding which, there is an ongoing exercise to send Manmohan Singh to the Rajya Sabha within the Congress
 bataa den ki 24 june ko madanlaal saini kaa akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan main 75 varsh kii aayu main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Congress had more than 6 months to become a Rajya Sabha member of MLA Madan Lal Saini more than BJP
 aise main paanch saal se zyada kaa vakt abhi bachaa hua he
 It is believed that there may be an election for Rajya Sabha in the state anytime in July
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii jeet ke baad rajasthan main congressi vidhayakon kii taadaad badi he
 In such a situation, the Congress hopes to win the Rajya Sabha elections
 congress ke paas seat jeetne kaa maukacongress ke paas philhal 100 khud ke vidhayak hai or gyaarah nirdaleey vidhayak hai, jo congress ke associat member ban chuke hai
 Apart from this, Congress also has the support of mlas of Bahujan Samaj Party and Bharatiya Tribal Party here whereas BJP has only 72 mlas
 aise main 200 sadasyeey vaali rajasthan vidhansabha main congress ke paas rajyasabha kii yah seat jeetne kaa mauka he
 After this, in August 2020, the tenure of three Rajya Sabha members of BJP is coming to an end
 magar congress itane lambey samay tak intjaar nahin karnaa chaahati he or manmohan singh ko rajyasabha main bhejnaa chaahati he
 According to Congress sources, discussions were also being held with the DMK in Tamil Nadu for this
 magar ab rajasthan main mauka aayaa he or jeet sunishchit he
 Therefore, Congress does not want to take any more risk regarding Manmohan Singh
 14 june ko khatm hua kaarykalagauratlab he ki manmohan singh kaa rajyasabha main kaarykaal 14 june ko khatm ho gaya he
 He has been a five-time Rajya Sabha MP from Assam
 jab vah pradhanmantri the, tab bhi vah rajyasabha se hi chunakar aae the
 His last term began on 15 June 2013 which ended on 14 June

 angreji akhbaar da times of india ne yah khabar di he
 According to the newspaper, Biryani has not been kept in the banquet offered to the Pakistani Prime Minister at Rashtrapati Bhavan
 bataaya jaataa he ki modi ne upie ke kaarykaal main pakistaniyon se baatcheet ko biryani diplomasi kaa naam diya tha or uskaa kaaphi majaak udaaya tha
 This dish made of rice and meat is quite popular but this time it will not be served while some other non-vegetarian dishes will be served
 pichley hafte shashi tharur ne twit kiya tha ki agar navaj sharif nimantran sweekaar karte hai to hamen ummid kerani chahie ki narendra modi unhen biryani jarur khilaaenge
 Now President Pranab Mukherjee has freed Modi from that dilemma
 unke staff ne vahaan biryani ko menu main nahin rakhaa he
 Other selected dishes are placed instead
 modi ne upie sarkaar kii pichley saal march main is baat ke liye aalochana kii thi ki unhone pakistani pradhanmantri raja parvej ko chikan biryani khilaayaa tha jabaki ek bhartiya sainik kaa sir kaat liya gaya tha

 Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also became the country's most successful one-day captain after defeating hosts England in the fourth ODI of the series played in Birmingham
 yah dhoni kii captaini main bharat kii 91veen van-de jeet thi, jabaki test maichon or tii-20 international maichon ke sabase kaamyaab bhartiya captain kaa tamgaa vah pehle hi hasil kar chuke hai
 Now in terms of statistics, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has surpassed the record of former India team captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who led the Indian team to a total of 90 matches under his captaincy
 ab is maamle main maujuuda samay main khel rahe duniya ke sabhi captainon main dhoni bhale hi awwal ho gaye hai, lekin sarvakalik saphaltam van-de captainon kii suchi main abhi unka number chatha he
 Australia veteran Ricky Ponting tops the list, captaining 230 matches to win his team in 165 matches
 unke baad australia ke hi alan border kaa naam he, jinaki captaini main kangaaroon ne 107 match jite, haalanki border ne kul 178 maichon main team kii captaini kaa daayitv nibhaayaa
 The third name in the list is the late South African captain Hansi Cronje, who captained 138 matches, and won his team in 99 matches
 chauthe number par newzealand ke stephen fleming kaa naam darj he, jinaki captaini main khele gaye 218 maichon main se kiwi team ne 98 maichon main jeet darj kii
 In fifth place is South Africa's Graeme Smith, who captained 150 one-day Internationals, and his team won 92 of them
 so, maujuuda raftaar se khelte or jitate rahe to 'mistar kool' ke naam se mashhoor mahendra singh dhoni jald hi riki ponting ke alaava sabhi anya captainon ko peeche chhodte dikhaai de sakate hai, lekin dhoni apni is kamyaabi ko team kii kamyaabi se jodakar hi dekhte hai
 He says, "when i was handed the captaincy, it was a fantastic team, and i still have a great team
 
 
 main un sabakaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahta hum, jinaki vajah se yah mumkin ho paaya
 
 
 " vaise, safal bhartiya captainon kii suchi banaai jaae, to dhoni ne birmingham main jitkar purv captain mohammad azahruddin ko peeche choda he, jinhone 174 van-de maichon main captaini kar 90 main jeet hasil kii thi, jabaki ab dhoni ne 162 van-de maichon main captaini kaa daayitv sambhalakar 91 main jeet darj kii he
 By the way, Dhoni has also lost 57 matches under his captaincy, while four matches were tied and 10 matches could not be concluded
 saphaltam captainon kii suchi main dhoni or azhar ke baad saurav ganguli kaa naam aata he, jinhone apane daur main 146 maichon main captain rahakar 76 jite
 He is followed by Rahul Dravid, who captained 79 one-day matches, and won 42, and fifth in the list is India's first World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev, who captained 74 matches and won 39
 
 vaise, ab agar kul milakar dekha jaae, to mahendra singh dhoni ke naam kaaphi safaltaaen darj hai - vah bharat ke sarvaadhik safal test captain hai, jisane 22 maichon main team ko jitayaa
 He is also now India's most successful one-day Captain
 dhoni hi bharat ke sarvaadhik safal tii-20 captain bhi hai, jisaki captaini main team india ne 26 maichon main jeet hasil kii he
 It was Dhoni who won the 2007 T20 World Cup title under his captaincy, and under his captaincy, Team India won the 2011 one-day World Cup title
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni kii kamyaabi kii yah fehrist behad lambii he, lekin upar likhi kuch kamyaabiyaan aisi hai, jo duniya ke kisi bhi cricket captain or team kaa sapana hoti hai
 The special thing is that Dhoni knows how to repeat his success
 vah baaki sabase kuch juda hai, or unke khilne kaa tarika or bhi alag he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni says, ‚ÄúI do what i do
 
 
 main yojana banaata hum, vah chal jaati he, to thik
 
 
 If it is not able to walk, then it is fine
 
 
 main apni yojana par kaayam rahata hum
 
 
 Sometimes you get wickets, sometimes you don't, but it has an effect, about which i do not want to tell more
 
 
 " Dhoni has repeatedly hinted that the 2015 World Cup is a big mission for him, and if Team India achieves success again next year in 2011, a history can be written in Indian cricket, which Cricket fans will remember it from generation to generation

 As soon as the unknown object fell, the people informed the police, the officer was trying to find out - the object fell
 The citizens of KV Kuppam of Kassvelore district were surprised on Monday night when an unknown object fell from the sky in their neighborhood
 nagarikon ne tatkaal police ko soochna di
 Police officers arrived at the scene along with a forensic expert
 agyaat vastu kii jaanch ke baad kaha gaya ki ye visphotak nahin kuch or he
 The unknown object had two LED bulbs that were still extinguishing after falling
 ye bhi sthaneey logon ke liye chintaa kii baat thi
 But when it was decided that the unknown object is not an explosive, a closer look showed it written on it - 'graw Radiosondes'
 ye ek company he jo mausam adhyayan ke liye upkaran banaati he
 When looking at the website of this company, there was a device which was found with the object falling from the sky
 ye market main uplabdh radiosonds main sabase halkaa or chota he
 It is one of the most used radiosondes in the world
 ye taapmaana, aadrata, hawa kaa dabaav, hawa kii disha or veg ko sateekta ke saath naapane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Officials are now trying to find out how this object or device fell from the sky in this area
 lagata he ki kisi ko ritairement acha nahin lagata tabhi jab bhi aisa elaan hota he ki ritairement kii umr badha di gai he jisaki nahin bhi badhati he wo bhi kush ho jaataa he
 On the other hand, people who read employment news after leaving college do not like this news
 unhen lagata he ki ab ye or teen saal ritair na hue to unki berojgaare ke saal bad jaaenge
 The person who is in the job is also in the same condition as unemployed, let's get three more years
 jo naukari main nahin he uski haalat laachaar jaisi to he hi
 When the Prime Minister said that he is going to make the age of 65 all doctors by making laws
 is khabar ko lekar kahin swaagat hua to kahin sugabugahat ki are kahin hamaare pet par prahaar to nahin he
 The 35-year-old youth is 65 percent and if the retirement age is 65 years, then these 35 percent will not have to wait for 65 years
 to hamane sochaa ki isi bahaane check kiya jaae ki doctor ritair kitne saal main hote hai
 Well, at the age of eighty eighty, the doctors are doing private practice and there is no problem for it, but what the government had till now thought it was 60 or 62, due to which there is so much enthusiasm for doing 65 years
 akhil bhartiya aryuvigyaan santhaan (ames) main ritairement kii umr 65 saal pehle se he
 The retirement age of doctors in Safdarjung Medical College is 60, 62 and 65 in different categories
 bihar main sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 Doctors retire in 65 years in all medical colleges of UP
 sarkari aspataalon ke specialist doctor 62 saal main ritair hote hai
 Non-specialist doctors have to retire in 60 years
 karnataka main doctoron ke ritairement kii umr 60 saal he
 Three government hospitals in Odisha have 65 years, the remaining hospitals have 62 years
 maharashtra main 64 saal main doctor ritair hote hai
 The Prime Minister rightly said that the retirement age at Medikal College is different
 aspataal main alag he
 Somewhere is 65 years and somewhere 60 to 62
 kai jagahon par umr badhaane kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 On 20 January 2015, a report appeared in the Hindu newspaper that then Manohar Lal Khattar had reduced the retirement age of Haryana state government employees from 60 to 58
 punjab or haryana hoicourt ne is faisle ko sahi mana tha
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was of the opinion that this decision would create maximum employment opportunities for the youth
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana tha ki phir haryana main iees, college ke teacher or nyaayik adhikari kyon 60 saal main ritair honge, ve bhi 58 main ho jaaen
 Opponents lost in court
 4 april 2016 ke india today kii site par ek or khabar he ki haryana sarkaar doctoron kii kami ko dur karne ke liye unke ritairement kii umr 58 se badhaakar 62 karnaa chaahati he
 The Haryana Health Minister said that such a proposal is under consideration
 urisa ne bhi sarkari doctoron kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye ritairement umr 60 se badha kar 65 saal kar diya tha
 But the Odisha Medical Services Association came out openly against this proposal
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likh diya
 Now it is not known to whom these associations will write letters because the Prime Minister is going to do 65 years
 hamaare desh main marizon ke anupaat main doctoron kii kami to he lekin kya ye kami isliye he ki is vakt doctor nahin hai
 If this is the case, you should not find a single doctor unemployed
 bharat main har saal kareeb 50,000 embibies doctor desh ke 370 medical college se nikalate hai
 India is the largest doctor producing country in the world
 america main har saal 18000 doctor nikalate hai magar unki aabaadi kii tulana bharat se nahin kii ja sakati
 Is quite low
 ab hamen samajhnaa ye he ki kya vaaki doctoron kii kami he hamaare desh main yaa sarkari aspataalon main bhartee hi nahin nikalati he or jinhen sarkari naukari milti he kya ve aspataalon main jate hai
 Many times doctors do not go on duty in government hospitals of Odisha
 2015 main odisha sarkaar ne 613 doctoron ke khilaaf notice bhi jari kiya tha
 Not only Odisha, you will find this story in government hospitals in all the states of the country
 iskaa matlab sarkari aspataalon ke tantra main bhi samasya he
 But the Times of India reported in April 2015 that the government would give an incentive of 80,000 rupees in addition to salary to doctors working in villages and difficult areas
 tab bhi doctor gaanvon main seva ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Afshan Yasmin reports in the Hindu newspaper of 30 January 2016 that a general surgeon appointed from the Karnataka Public Service Commission resigned on the very next day of appointment
 ek mahila doctor jwine karne ke baad aspataal hi nahin gai
 Afshan has written that 1122 doctors were reinstated but only 597 came on duty
 jabaki public sarvice kamishan jab duusare padon kii bahaali nikalataa he to vahaan seat se zyada aavedak hote hai
 When the resettlement for government hospitals comes out, fewer applications come from seats
 ye chand udhaaharan bin kar isliye laayaa taaki pataa chale ki ham umr badha kar koi krantikari faisla le rahe hai yaa krantikari faisla na lenaa pade isliye umr badha rahe hai
 Do governments not try at all that doctors do not come
 aisa to nahin lagata
 The Akhilesh government of UP has said that if doctors go to the villages, then at the time of admission in post graduation, thirty numbers will be found separately
 doctoron se baat kar pataa chalata he ki sarkari aspataalon main kaam karnaa jhamela he
 There is a tightness from atmosphere to chance
 ve 65 saal karne ke faisle se bahut utsahit nahin hai
 Now we want to know whether fewer doctors are being born in our country
 pradhanmantri kii ek baat to thik lagati he ki ek din main to doctor paidaa nahin ho sakate
 Doctoral studies are of many years, but then why should the post graduate seats be so low in our country
 50,000 doctor agar embibies karte hai to 25,577 seat kyon hai post grajuation ke liye
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye
 The condition in the government medical college is that the youth passes, the doctor is not able to become a faculty
 lihaaza wo hataash hokar privet aspataalon main chalaa jaataa he jahaan paisa pad or kathith rup se azaadi milti he
 His plea for freedom in private hospitals seems to be fake, some is real
 doctoron kaa hona bahut zaruri he lekin kya is vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye thos surgery ho rahi he
 There is no shortage of doctors, there is no excuse for not going to the villages, have the governments improved the facilities of doctors working in hospitals in the villages, has increased the funding of research in government medical colleges, has the teaching environment improved is
 kahin aisa to nahin ki kami ke kaaran kii jagah kami kaa bahaanaa banaakar 65 saal sirf vaahvahee luutane ke liye kii gai he
 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 pradhanmantri ne jab kaha ki ve kanoon banaakar sabhi doctoron kii umr 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There was a welcome about this news and somewhere there was a rumor that there was no attack on our stomach
 35 saal ke yuva 65 pratishat hai or agar ritairement kii umr 65 saal ho gai to kahin in 35 pratishat waalon ko 65 saal tak intazaar to nahin karnaa padegaa
 So we thought that in the pretext of checking how many years the doctors retire
 vaise to assi assi saal kii umr main doctor privet practice kar rahe hai or iske koi dikkat bhi nahin he magar sarkaar ne ab tak kya soch kar 60 yaa 62 kar rakhaa tha jiske kaaran 65 saal karne ko lekar itnaa ullas he
 Retirement at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is 65 years old
 safadarajang medical college main alag-alag shrenee main doctoron kii ritairement umr 60, 62 or 65 hoti he
 Doctors retire in 65 years in government hospitals in Bihar
 upi ke sabhi medical college main doctor 65 saal main ritair hote hai
 Specialist doctors of government hospitals retire in 62 years
 gair specialist doctoron ko 60 saal main ritair hona padataa he
 The retirement age of doctors in Karnataka is 60 years
 odisha ke teen sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal he, baaki ke aspataalon main 62 saal he
 Doctors retire in Maharashtra in 64 years
 pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki medikaal college main ritairement umr alag he
 Hospital is different
 kahin 65 saal he to kahin 60 se 62 he
 In many places there has been a demand for increasing the age
 20 janvari 2015 ko hindu akhbaar main ek report chhapi he ki tab manohar laal khatter ne haryana rajya ke sarkari karmchaariyon ke ritair hone kii umr 60 se ghataakar 58 kar di thi
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court accepted the verdict as correct
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii raay thi ki is faisle se yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke adhiktam avasar paidaa honge
 Those who opposed said that then why should IAS, college teachers and judicial officers retire in 60 years in Haryana, they should also become 58
 court main virdohi haar gaye
 There is another news on India Today site of 4 April 2016 that Haryana Government wants to increase their retirement age from 58 to 62 to overcome the shortage of doctors
 haryana ke swasthya mantri kaa bayaan tha ki aise prastaav par vichaar ho rahaa he
 Orissa also increased the retirement age from 60 to 65 years to meet the shortage of government doctors
 magar is prastaav ke khilaaf odisha medical sarvice association khulkar aa gaya
 Even wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 ab pataa nahin ye association vaale kise patr likhenge kyonki pradhanmantri bhi 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There is a shortage of doctors in the proportion of patients in our country, but is this a shortage because there are no doctors at this time
 agar aisa he to aapako ek bhi doctor berojgaar nahin milanaa chahie
 Every year around 50,000 MBBS doctors in India come from 370 medical colleges in the country
 bharat duniya main sabase zyada doctor paidaa karne vaala desh he
 There are 18000 doctors every year in America, but their population cannot be compared to India
 kaaphi kam he
 Now we have to understand whether there is really a shortage of doctors in our country or in government hospitals, recruitment does not come out and those who get government jobs go to hospitals
 odisha ke sarkari aspataalon main kai baar doctor duty par jate hi nahin he
 In 2015, the Odisha government also issued a notice against 613 doctors
 odisha hi nahin ye kahani aapako desh ke tamaam rajyon ke sarkari aspataalon main milegi
 It also means a problem in the system of government hospitals
 lekin april 2015 kii times aaf india kii khabar he ki sarkaar gaanvon or mushkil ilaakon main kaam karne vaale doctoron ko vetan ke alaava 80,000 rupaya protsaahan raashi degi
 Even then the doctor is not ready for service in the villages
 30 janvari 2016 ke hindu akhbaar main afshaan yasmine kii report he ki karnataka public sarvice kamishan se niyukt ek general sarjan ne niyukti ke agle hi din istipha de diya
 a female doctor did not go to the hospital after joining
 afshaan ne likhaa he ki 1122 doctoron kii bahaali hui magar 597 hi duty par aae
 Whereas when the Public Service Commission comes out of the resumption of other posts, there are more applicants than seats
 sarkari aspataalon ke liye bahaali nikalati he to seat se kam aavedan aate hai
 Brought this few examples so that we know that we are taking a revolutionary decision by increasing our age or not having to take a revolutionary decision
 kya sarkarein bilkul prayaas nahin karti ki doctor nahin aae
 It does not seem so
 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge
 Talking to doctors shows that working in government hospitals is a mess
 maahaul se lekar maukey tak kii tangi he
 They are not very excited by the decision to do 65 years
 ab ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main kam doctor paidaa ho rahe hai
 One thing about the Prime Minister seems to be that doctors cannot be born in a day
 doctorl kii padhai kai saal kii hoti he lekin phir hamaare desh main post graduate kii seat itani kam kyon hon
 If 50,000 doctors do MBBS then why 25,577 seats are for post graduation
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015
 may 2015 main unki umr 65 ho gai
 The age of retirement in Maharashtra is 64 years
 is dauraan jab radio therapy kaa professor nahin mila, professor na hone se radio therapy kii donon siten chali jaatin lihaaza sarkaar ne yah prastaav taiyaar kiya ki jo contract par doctor rakhe jate hai unki umr 65 se badhaakar 70 kar di jaae
 This story tells that by increasing age we are covering the problem
 post graduate kii seat badhaai ja sakati he
 Till when there will be a post-graduate seat, where will the teacher be born, where will the doctor be born when there is no teacher
 tippaniyan Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase
 yah ek chakra he
 Governments can overcome this deficiency in one to two years if they wish
 ritairement umr kii jagah post grajuation kii seat badha detii to lagata ki iraadaa saaf he
 When OBC reservation was given in the nomination, within a few months the seats also increased and the class rooms were also built
 sarkari medical college main haalat yah he ki javaani guzar jaati he doctor faikalti nahin ban paata he
 So he gets frustrated and goes to private hospitals where the money position and alleged freedom are found
 privet aspataalon main azaadi kii unki daleel kuch nakli lagati he kuch asli bhi hoti he
 It is very important to have doctors, but are there solid surgeries to improve this system
 doctor kii kami nahin lagati, kahin gaanvon main nahin jane kaa bahaanaa to nahin, kya sarkaron ne ganvo main aspataalon main doctoron ke kaam karne kii suvidha behatar kiye hai, kya sarkari medical collejon main research kaa fund badhaayaa he, kya teaching kaa maahaul behatar hua he
 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 Retirement at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is 65 years old
 safadarajang medical college main alag-alag shrenee main doctoron kii ritairement umr 60, 62 or 65 hoti he
 Doctors retire in 65 years in government hospitals in Bihar
 upi ke sabhi medical college main doctor 65 saal main ritair hote hai
 Specialist doctors of government hospitals retire in 62 years
 gair specialist doctoron ko 60 saal main ritair hona padataa he
 The retirement age of doctors in Karnataka is 60 years
 odisha ke teen sarkari aspataalon main 65 saal he, baaki ke aspataalon main 62 saal he
 Doctors retire in Maharashtra in 64 years
 pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki medikaal college main ritairement umr alag he
 Hospital is different
 kahin 65 saal he to kahin 60 se 62 he
 In many places there has been a demand for increasing the age
 20 janvari 2015 ko hindu akhbaar main ek report chhapi he ki tab manohar laal khatter ne haryana rajya ke sarkari karmchaariyon ke ritair hone kii umr 60 se ghataakar 58 kar di thi
 The Punjab and Haryana High Court accepted the verdict as correct
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter kii raay thi ki is faisle se yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke adhiktam avasar paidaa honge
 Those who opposed said that then why should IAS, college teachers and judicial officers retire in 60 years in Haryana, they should also become 58
 court main virdohi haar gaye
 There is another news on India Today site of 4 April 2016 that Haryana Government wants to increase their retirement age from 58 to 62 to overcome the shortage of doctors
 haryana ke swasthya mantri kaa bayaan tha ki aise prastaav par vichaar ho rahaa he
 Orissa also increased the retirement age from 60 to 65 years to meet the shortage of government doctors
 magar is prastaav ke khilaaf odisha medical sarvice association khulkar aa gaya
 Even wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 ab pataa nahin ye association vaale kise patr likhenge kyonki pradhanmantri bhi 65 saal karne ja rahe hai
 There is a shortage of doctors in the proportion of patients in our country, but is this a shortage because there are no doctors at this time
 agar aisa he to aapako ek bhi doctor berojgaar nahin milanaa chahie
 Every year around 50,000 MBBS doctors in India come from 370 medical colleges in the country
 bharat duniya main sabase zyada doctor paidaa karne vaala desh he
 There are 18000 doctors every year in America, but their population cannot be compared to India
 kaaphi kam he
 Now we have to understand whether there is really a shortage of doctors in our country or in government hospitals, recruitment does not come out and those who get government jobs go to hospitals
 odisha ke sarkari aspataalon main kai baar doctor duty par jate hi nahin he
 In 2015, the Odisha government also issued a notice against 613 doctors
 odisha hi nahin ye kahani aapako desh ke tamaam rajyon ke sarkari aspataalon main milegi
 It also means a problem in the system of government hospitals
 lekin april 2015 kii times aaf india kii khabar he ki sarkaar gaanvon or mushkil ilaakon main kaam karne vaale doctoron ko vetan ke alaava 80,000 rupaya protsaahan raashi degi
 Even then the doctor is not ready for service in the villages
 30 janvari 2016 ke hindu akhbaar main afshaan yasmine kii report he ki karnataka public sarvice kamishan se niyukt ek general sarjan ne niyukti ke agle hi din istipha de diya
 a female doctor did not go to the hospital after joining
 afshaan ne likhaa he ki 1122 doctoron kii bahaali hui magar 597 hi duty par aae
 Whereas when the Public Service Commission comes out of the resumption of other posts, there are more applicants than seats
 sarkari aspataalon ke liye bahaali nikalati he to seat se kam aavedan aate hai
 Brought this few examples so that we know that we are taking a revolutionary decision by increasing our age or not having to take a revolutionary decision
 kya sarkarein bilkul prayaas nahin karti ki doctor nahin aae
 It does not seem so
 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge
 Talking to doctors shows that working in government hospitals is a mess
 maahaul se lekar maukey tak kii tangi he
 They are not very excited by the decision to do 65 years
 ab ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main kam doctor paidaa ho rahe hai
 One thing about the Prime Minister seems to be that doctors cannot be born in a day
 doctorl kii padhai kai saal kii hoti he lekin phir hamaare desh main post graduate kii seat itani kam kyon hon
 If 50,000 doctors do MBBS then why 25,577 seats are for post graduation
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015

 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 The Prime Minister rightly said that the retirement age at Medikal College is different
 aspataal main alag he
 Somewhere is 65 years and somewhere 60 to 62
 kai jagahon par umr badhaane kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 On 20 January 2015, a report appeared in the Hindu newspaper that then Manohar Lal Khattar had reduced the retirement age of Haryana state government employees from 60 to 58
 punjab or haryana hoicourt ne is faisle ko sahi mana tha
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was of the opinion that this decision would create maximum employment opportunities for the youth
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana tha ki phir haryana main iees, college ke teacher or nyaayik adhikari kyon 60 saal main ritair honge, ve bhi 58 main ho jaaen
 Opponents lost in court
 4 april 2016 ke india today kii site par ek or khabar he ki haryana sarkaar doctoron kii kami ko dur karne ke liye unke ritairement kii umr 58 se badhaakar 62 karnaa chaahati he
 The Haryana Health Minister said that such a proposal is under consideration
 urisa ne bhi sarkari doctoron kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye ritairement umr 60 se badha kar 65 saal kar diya tha
 But the Odisha Medical Services Association came out openly against this proposal
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri ko bhi patr likh diya
 Now it is not known to whom these associations will write letters because the Prime Minister is going to do 65 years
 hamaare desh main marizon ke anupaat main doctoron kii kami to he lekin kya ye kami isliye he ki is vakt doctor nahin hai
 If this is the case, you should not find a single doctor unemployed
 bharat main har saal kareeb 50,000 embibies doctor desh ke 370 medical college se nikalate hai
 India is the largest doctor producing country in the world
 america main har saal 18000 doctor nikalate hai magar unki aabaadi kii tulana bharat se nahin kii ja sakati
 Is quite low
 ab hamen samajhnaa ye he ki kya vaaki doctoron kii kami he hamaare desh main yaa sarkari aspataalon main bhartee hi nahin nikalati he or jinhen sarkari naukari milti he kya ve aspataalon main jate hai
 Many times doctors do not go on duty in government hospitals of Odisha
 2015 main odisha sarkaar ne 613 doctoron ke khilaaf notice bhi jari kiya tha
 Not only Odisha, you will find this story in government hospitals in all the states of the country
 iskaa matlab sarkari aspataalon ke tantra main bhi samasya he
 But the Times of India reported in April 2015 that the government would give an incentive of 80,000 rupees in addition to salary to doctors working in villages and difficult areas
 tab bhi doctor gaanvon main seva ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Afshan Yasmin reports in the Hindu newspaper of 30 January 2016 that a general surgeon appointed from the Karnataka Public Service Commission resigned on the very next day of appointment
 ek mahila doctor jwine karne ke baad aspataal hi nahin gai
 Afshan has written that 1122 doctors were reinstated but only 597 came on duty
 jabaki public sarvice kamishan jab duusare padon kii bahaali nikalataa he to vahaan seat se zyada aavedak hote hai
 When the resettlement for government hospitals comes out, fewer applications come from seats
 ye chand udhaaharan bin kar isliye laayaa taaki pataa chale ki ham umr badha kar koi krantikari faisla le rahe hai yaa krantikari faisla na lenaa pade isliye umr badha rahe hai
 Do governments not try at all that doctors do not come
 aisa to nahin lagata
 The Akhilesh government of UP has said that if doctors go to the villages, then at the time of admission in post graduation, thirty numbers will be found separately
 doctoron se baat kar pataa chalata he ki sarkari aspataalon main kaam karnaa jhamela he
 There is a tightness from atmosphere to chance
 ve 65 saal karne ke faisle se bahut utsahit nahin hai
 Now we want to know whether fewer doctors are being born in our country
 pradhanmantri kii ek baat to thik lagati he ki ek din main to doctor paidaa nahin ho sakate
 Doctoral studies are of many years, but then why should the post graduate seats be so low in our country
 50,000 doctor agar embibies karte hai to 25,577 seat kyon hai post grajuation ke liye
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye
 The condition in the government medical college is that the youth passes, the doctor is not able to become a faculty
 lihaaza wo hataash hokar privet aspataalon main chalaa jaataa he jahaan paisa pad or kathith rup se azaadi milti he
 His plea for freedom in private hospitals seems to be fake, some is real
 doctoron kaa hona bahut zaruri he lekin kya is vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye thos surgery ho rahi he
 There is no shortage of doctors, there is no excuse for not going to the villages, have the governments improved the facilities of doctors working in hospitals in the villages, has increased the funding of research in government medical colleges, has the teaching environment improved is
 kahin aisa to nahin ki kami ke kaaran kii jagah kami kaa bahaanaa banaakar 65 saal sirf vaahvahee luutane ke liye kii gai he
 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them

 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge
 Talking to doctors shows that working in government hospitals is a mess
 maahaul se lekar maukey tak kii tangi he
 They are not very excited by the decision to do 65 years
 ab ham yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main kam doctor paidaa ho rahe hai
 One thing about the Prime Minister seems to be that doctors cannot be born in a day
 doctorl kii padhai kai saal kii hoti he lekin phir hamaare desh main post graduate kii seat itani kam kyon hon
 If 50,000 doctors do MBBS then why 25,577 seats are for post graduation
 maharashtra main radio therapy main piji karne ke liye sirf do seat he
 While the number of cancer patients is continuously increasing
 vigat varsh times of india ne likhaa he ki puure maharashtra main radio therapy ke ek hi professor hai
 Those who should have retired in 2007 at the age of 60 but Dr
 Kamble continued to teach at Nagpur Medical College till May 2015
 may 2015 main unki umr 65 ho gai
 The age of retirement in Maharashtra is 64 years
 is dauraan jab radio therapy kaa professor nahin mila, professor na hone se radio therapy kii donon siten chali jaatin lihaaza sarkaar ne yah prastaav taiyaar kiya ki jo contract par doctor rakhe jate hai unki umr 65 se badhaakar 70 kar di jaae
 This story tells that by increasing age we are covering the problem
 post graduate kii seat badhaai ja sakati he
 Till when there will be a post-graduate seat, where will the teacher be born, where will the doctor be born when there is no teacher
 tippaniyan Because there will be a teacher, there will be post graduate students only then the seat will also increase
 yah ek chakra he
 Governments can overcome this deficiency in one to two years if they wish
 ritairement umr kii jagah post grajuation kii seat badha detii to lagata ki iraadaa saaf he
 When OBC reservation was given in the nomination, within a few months the seats also increased and the class rooms were also built
 sarkari medical college main haalat yah he ki javaani guzar jaati he doctor faikalti nahin ban paata he
 So he gets frustrated and goes to private hospitals where the money position and alleged freedom are found
 privet aspataalon main azaadi kii unki daleel kuch nakli lagati he kuch asli bhi hoti he
 It is very important to have doctors, but are there solid surgeries to improve this system
 doctor kii kami nahin lagati, kahin gaanvon main nahin jane kaa bahaanaa to nahin, kya sarkaron ne ganvo main aspataalon main doctoron ke kaam karne kii suvidha behatar kiye hai, kya sarkari medical collejon main research kaa fund badhaayaa he, kya teaching kaa maahaul behatar hua he
 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 Brought this few examples so that we know that we are taking a revolutionary decision by increasing our age or not having to take a revolutionary decision
 kya sarkarein bilkul prayaas nahin karti ki doctor nahin aae
 It does not seem so
 upi kii akhilesh sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar doctor gaanvon main jaaenge to post grajuation main admician ke vakt tees number alag se milenge

 Is it not that 65 years have been done only to rob bravado, instead of lack of excuse
 privet sansthaanon main ritairement umr 70 saal he taaki 65 par doctor nikle to wo le jaaen
 Maharashtra has just two seats to do PG in Radio Therapy
 jabaki cancer ke marizon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Last year, the Times of India wrote that there is only one professor of radio therapy all over Maharashtra
 jinhen 60 saal kii umr main 2007 main ritair ho janaa chahie tha lekin doctor kamble nagpur medical college main may 2015 tak padhaate rahe
 She turned 65 in May 2015
 maharashtra main ritairement kii umr 64 saal he
 During this time, when the professor of radio therapy was not found, the absence of a professor would lead to both seats of radio therapy, so the government prepared a proposal that the age of doctors who are hired on contract should be increased from 65 to 70
 yah kahani bataati he ki umr badhaakar ham samasya par pardaa daal rahe hai
 Post graduate seats can be increased
 jab tak post graduate seat nahin hogi to padhaane vaale teacher kahaan se paidaa honge, jab teacher hi nahin honge to doctor kahaan se paidaa honge
 The comments kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle
 sarkarein chahen to is kami ko ek do saal main dur kar sakati hai
 Had the post-graduation seat been increased instead of retirement age, the intention would have been clear
 jab namakan main obisi aarakshan diya gaya tha tab kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar siten bhi bad gayi or class room bhi ban gaye
 The condition in the government medical college is that the youth passes, the doctor is not able to become a faculty
 lihaaza wo hataash hokar privet aspataalon main chalaa jaataa he jahaan paisa pad or kathith rup se azaadi milti he
 His plea for freedom in private hospitals seems to be fake, some is real
 doctoron kaa hona bahut zaruri he lekin kya is vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye thos surgery ho rahi he
 There is no shortage of doctors, there is no excuse for not going to the villages, have the governments improved the facilities of doctors working in hospitals in the villages, has increased the funding of research in government medical colleges, has the teaching environment improved is
 kahin aisa to nahin ki kami ke kaaran kii jagah kami kaa bahaanaa banaakar 65 saal sirf vaahvahee luutane ke liye kii gai he
 Retirement age in private institutions is 70 years so that if doctors come out at 65, they take them
 kyonki teacher hoga, post graduate chaatr honge tabhi to seat bhi badhegi
 This is a cycle

 ‚Äô The Delhi High Court has given a big relief to the promise of the Aam Aadmi Party, which provides full statehood
 hoicourt ne aam aadmi party ke vigyapanon par roak lagane ke liye daayar yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The High Court rejected this PIL filed during the election season as not being eligible for hearing
 janhit yachika main kaha gaya tha ki purna rajya kaa darja dene kii baat kahkar aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaavon main dilli ke votaron ko dhokhaa dene kii koshish kar rahi he
 Based on this, the petition said that the advertisements of the party associated with wooing voters by lying
 yachika main is baat par khaas jor diya gaya tha ki agar dilli main loksabhaa kii sabhi 7 seat bhi aam aadmi party jitati he to bhi parliament main wo dilli main purna rajya kaa darja nahin dilaa sakati
 But the Aam Aadmi Party is seeking votes in the Lok Sabha elections from the voters of Delhi in the name of getting full statehood
 yachika main is daawey ko puri tarah se bhraamak or galat he bataaya gaya
 The petition said that misinformation was both legal and moral in its own right to gain votes from voters before the elections
 is yachika main court se kaha gaya tha ki aam aadmi party kii taraf se purna rajya se jude jitne bhi vigyaapan chaape yaa prasaarit kiye ja rahe hai, unako turant roka jaae
 But in the matter, as soon as the hearing started in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, the court made it clear that they do not consider such petitions to be hearable and it is not necessary to issue any guidelines
 court ko andaja tha ki agle hafte dilli main hone vaale chunaav ke maddenjar is tarah kii janhit yachika lagaai gai he, jo janhit main kam or raajnneetik makasad se lagaai gai zyada dikhaai padati he
 This petition was filed under section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, which said that to get full statehood status in Delhi, it is necessary for any government to be in absolute majority so that the bill can be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and the Aam Aadmi Party's There is no such majority
 yah yachika saurabh kansal or surabhi kansal kii taraf se dilli hai court main daayar kii gai thi

 Here are some excerpts from a special conversation with Ayushmann Khurrana: What would you like to say after the hit of 'dum Lagaake Haisha'? Looks great after many years
 'viki donor' ke baad ab jaakar ek baar phir se bahut khushi ho rahi he
 Although 'nautanki Sala' also did well, but this time the film has also been appreciated by the critics

 kya ab aap aane vaali filmon ke liye diarector or producers se mol bhav karne kii sthiti main aa gaye hai ?abhi to bas mujhe aditya chopra or shoojit sarkaar se ek guru mantra mila he kii sho karo, painting karo, aaraam se relax karo or jab bhi script kaa chayan karo to khud se karo
 So i am comfortable working now
 aapaki 90 ke dashak kii kya yaaden hai ?bas yahi ki un dinon skool jaaya karata tha, gaanon kii casette sunata tha
 You also remember the name of each cassette
 'aashiqui' or 'dil' kaa combo
 Apart from this, lists were made to fill songs
 us 90 ke dashak ko main behad miss karata hum
 What is the first choice, stage, mic or acting? Stage, because there we do everything at one time
 jab aapaki aalochana hoti he to kya manosthiti hoti he ?itnaa sara kaam kiya he radio, tivi or filmon main ki ab aadat si ho gai he utaar-chadhaav kii
 So now i get to learn something by every mistake
 kis insaan kii aatmakatha par banane vaali film kaa hissaa bananaa chahenge ?meri ichha he ki sachin tendulkar kii aatmakatha kaa hissaa banuun kyonki main unka bahut bada fain hum
 How do i like myself more - in clean shave or beard? i like myself in light beard though my look was kept clean on demand for the character in 'dum Lagae Haisha'
 aane vaale dinon main koun-koun si filmein kar rahe hai ?jaldbaaji main nahin hum
 i am ready to do Shoojit Sarkar's film

 You will be shocked to hear the names of filmmakers Fahd Mustafa and Deepti Kakkar or "actors" Loha Singh and Ritu Maheshwari
 aap kah sakate hai ki kisi bahaki-bahaki baaten kar rahe hai, ye koun log hai? inkaa naam hamane kaise kahin nahin suna? chaunkiye mat, maine bhi nahin suna tha, jab tak main vaaki chaunk nahin uthaa
 Last week an 80-minute documentary was shown in several of our multiscreen halls
 haalanki use aise samay dikhaaya ja rahaa tha jab zyada log haul main janaa pasand nahin karte
 Nevertheless, the reviews called it a Dhansu film, but when i went to see it in a mall in South Delhi, the concierge told me that only a few people had arrived at the hall with tickets
 main ravivaar ko shaam 3
 When we reached to see it at 45, there were only 15 more people
 isliye kisi bhi myne main yah film pipli live sareekhee charchaa nahin bator saki
 We are discussing Fahd and Deepti here because perhaps they can be counted among our most creative young people
 unhone hamaare sadate-bujhate badboodaar shaharon main bijli chori ke sangathit kaarobaar par behad naatakeey or ankhen kholane vaali documentary contiyaabaaz banaai he or yah shaayad hamaare sabase zyada bujhate shahar kanpur kii katha he
 Then we are also discussing its main characters - Loha Singh and Ritu Maheshwari because they do the same in real life and have played these roles with great courage and honesty in the film
 loha singh nate kad ke thulthule sharir vaale hai or unki ungliyaan kuch tedi-medhi-si ho gai hai, shaayad bijli ke jhtke khaakar
 He is the "katiyabaaz" of the city
 yani ek ‚Äò‚Äòcontia‚Äô‚Äô ke jariye ve dusron ke conection se bijli chura lete hai
 When all the measures fail, but the need for electricity is desperate, then people take the help of Loha Singh
 or ve kisi duusare ke conection se bijli churaate hai or aapako dekar apni roji-roti chalaate hai
 The bonus is that you do not have to pay the cost of that electricity either
 isi se ladgaye kii koshish sirf maheshwari karti hai
 This young IAS officer is the Chief Executive Officer of Kanpur Electricity Supply Company (KESCO)
 yah sarkari company 2,000 karod ru
 Many have gone bankrupt due to dues of more than Rs
 vah grid se bijli kharidne yaa nae transformaron par kharch karne ke kaabil nahin he
 Often these transformers catch fire during the summer season, which is a common sight in all cities
 aise main unka kaam asambhav-sa he or shaayad unase gambhirtha se use anjaam dene kii ummid bhi nahin kii jaati he
 Still, she tries and is angered by the local Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki and is transferred in 11 months
 uttar pradesh main aisi kahaniyaan aam hai
 But i reached home and started searching on Google and found that they were real characters
 2003 batch kii yah iees afasar punjab ejineering college se first divijan se graduate he or unki upiessi profile se pataa chalata he ki unke tabadale akasar hote rahete hai
 So when she smiles and tells in front of the camera that her children were able to complete their year-long studies in a school only once, you immediately realize what she is saying
 hamane haryana main ashok khemka or uttar pradesh main durga shakti nagpal kii surkhiyaan to dekhi hai lekin yahaan ek or iees afasar vyavastha se loha lene ko taiyaar he
 He has done a similar role in the documentary
 udhar, loha singh bhi apni gaaliyon or hazirajvaabi se utane hi saahasik lagate hai
 The credit line of this film mentions Loha Singh, Ritu Maheshwari and the people of Kanpur
 shaayad ve ham sabhi, shahari bharatiyon kaa naam bhi jod sakate hai
 Of course, we are the people of the country in a distorted sense of "freedom fighters" because we all want something free from grain to highways, water to electricity, especially if the government is providing it
 yah bhaavana hamaare shaharon main kaaphi majboot he
 In an Indian city, you want to pay to the municipal corporation and income tax payers but not to the electricians
 bijli ke maamle main aap yaa to inspector ko ghoose dena yaa phir kisi ‚Äò‚Äòcontiyaabaaz‚Äô‚Äô kii madad lenaa pasand karte hai
 When the entire electricity business was run by the old government departments, it was very easy
 lekin bijli sudhaaron ke baad zyaadaatar rajyon main rajya bijli bordon kaa bistar gol karke utpaadan, transmishan or vitaran ke liye nai companiyaan bana lee gai hai (amuman inhen jankose, transkoj or discoms kehete hai)
 They are still government but their rates are decided by the regulator and their balance sheet needs to be corrected
 agar aisa nahin he to rajya ko apane bajet se use adaa karnaa hota he
 Privatization of electricity has taken place in some big cities - like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Delhi
 contiyaabaaz yah behad prabhavi tareeke se dikhaati or bataati he ki darasal bharat ke gambhir bijli sankat kii sachai kya he
 For the past several years, i have been roaming around the country in many elections and everywhere, every person's most serious complaint is about electricity
 sarkarein adhik-se-adhik bijligharon kaa vaada karti hai or bataati hai ki falaan-falaan varsh main itane hajaar megawatt bijli utpaadan ke sanyantr lagaae gaye
 No one wants to tell that there is a shortage of electricity, but not so much that there is darkness in our lives
 samasya yah he ki bijli utpaadan main paise lagate hai or ham, bharat ke log, uske liye bhugtan karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 My colleague, India Today (hindi) editor Anshuman Tiwari, introduced me to a variety of statistics to reveal the astonishing reality of the country's self-imposed power crisis
 kendriya bijli praadhikaran (siie) kii july 2014 kii report (http: / / goo
 glxjfddn) gives some interesting facts about this
 masalan, kya aap yakeen karenge ki us maheene desh main kul bijli kami mahaj 3
 6 percent, 3 in the busiest time
 9 pratishat tak pahunchi thi? uttar main yah kami 5
 8 percent and even in the busiest times in the west and east respectively, only 0
 9 or 1
 Was 7 percent
 to phir itnaa bada sankat kahaan se ban aayaa?isaki pehali vajah to yah he ki hamase bijli kii sahi keemat nahin lee jaati, khaskar kisaanon se to bilkul nahin
 And when we have to give, we find out ways of not giving 
 natijatan, rajya sarkaron kii zyaadaatar bijli companiyon kii haalat gambhir he kuch to keiessio kii tarah diwalia ho chuki hai
 They do not have the money to buy electricity, which now needs to work openly or upgrade the distribution system
 agar kisi company kaa mukhiya bakaayaa vasuulne kii gambhirtha se koshish karata he to use maheshwari kii niyati jhelni padati he
 Our power crisis gets worse because subsidies are given and there is a habit of burning electricity for free
 yahi nahin, hamaari sarkarein bakaayaa bhi vasuulne main naakaam hai
 If electricity distribution is such a poor business, then how are our private companies making profits in CESC, BSES, etc? a report in the CEA report is of T&D losses
 puraani angreji main iskaa matlab transmishan or vitaran ke ghate se he lekin bijli kshetra main kisi se puuchhie to vah iskaa arth fouran batayega, chori or dakaiti ghaataa
 This report provides us with figures for 2010-11 and 2011-12 and a deficit of 23 respectively
 97 pratishat or 23
 67 percent
 iskaa matlab yah he ki 15 saal ke bijli sudhaaron ke baavjood samooche bijli utpaadan or vitaran kaa kareeb ek-chauthai ganvaa diya jaataa he
 Most of us steal citizens of all classes
 ham athulaneey log hai, ham bijli kii daron ke liye pradarshan karte hai
 Nevertheless, we happily install gensets in our homes and make our own electricity from more expensive diesel
 yaad kiijie, arvind kejariwal ne jab dilli main bijli bilon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya tha to vah hamaare dil ko kaise chhu gaya tha
 The truth is that the electricity situation in Delhi has been much better than before, the T&D deficit is quite low
 lekin companiyaan nijee hai
 So they arrange for us to pay
 lekin ham, ‚Äò‚Äòswatantraaa senaanee‚Äô‚Äô bhugtan karne ke aadi nahin hai
 For this reason, we considered Kejriwal as our hero when he was using his IIT engineering skills to connect disconnected electricity connections by not paying money
 isi vajah se kanpur, yaa desh main duusari jagahon par log bijli chori karne ke liye paise dena chaahate hai, chaahe ve us takanic ko ‚Äò‚Äòcontia‚Äô‚Äô kahen yaa duusare uttar bhartiya rajyon main ‚Äò‚Äòkundi‚Äô‚Äô lagaana kahen
 In Uttar Pradesh, it is like an epidemic in the same way as cheating in examinations
 ek baar phir siie kii report kii ore rukh karen
 Shortage of electricity at the busiest time in the country's largest state 23
 6 fisadi he, jo uttar bharat main kul kami kaa 5

 isaki vajah vahi he ki log bhugtan nahin karte
 Come now, two prominent foreign scholars Prof

 bakaul unke, yah rajnatik aparaadh nahin he, mahaj ‚Äò‚Äòsthaneey rasukhadaaron ke jariye saarvajanik satta par kabiz‚Äô‚Äô hone jaisi aam baat he
 There is a simple relationship: if you let me steal, if you get caught then save and i will vote for you
 isi tareeke se irfan solanki kanpur main phir chunaav jitate hai
 So the story of the power crisis stems from a relationship between strangely cynical people and leaders

 88wein auskar samaaroh main anemated film 'insaide out' ko best feechar film kaa award mila he
 The special thing is that the film is made in the supervision of Sajan Sakaria, an Indian youth living in Kerala
 film main unhone behtareen tareeke se jindagi ke sukh-dukh, dar or krodh ko dikhaaya he
 Favorite film of children and youngsters, let us tell you that before getting the Oscar, this film has been very well liked between children and youngsters
 sakaaria isse pehle bhi'toy story' or 'finding nemo'jaisi lokapriy anemated filmon kaa hissaa rah chuke hai
 According to the news published in Cartoons Times of India, since childhood, Sakaria was fond of making cartoons since childhood

 Often a small incident by engineering a changed line brings a big change in our lives

 At the same time, Sakaria decided that he would now proceed in the same line in which he was interested and proficient

 Amid the ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, Mamata Banerjee has raised questions on the Air Strike (IAF Air Strike) by the Indian Air Force at the terror camp
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee (mamata banerjee) ne brihaspativaar ko kaha ki javaanon kaa jivan chunavi raajnneeti se zyada keemtee he, lekin desh ko yah jaanane kaa adhikaar he ki pakistan ke balakot main vayusena ke hawaii hamale ke baad vastav main vahaan kya hua tha
 Let me tell you that on February 26, the Indian Air Force carried out an air strike on the Jaish terror camp on the land of Pakistan, in which about 300 terrorists were killed
 videshi media kii un reporton kaa hawala dete hue jinamein kaha gaya tha ki balakot main aatanki shiviron par bhartiya vaayu sena ke hamalon se koi nuksaan nahin hua he, mamata ne kaha, "balon ko tathyon ke saath saamne aane kaa mauka diya janaa chahie
 "mamta told reporters at the state secretariat here," After the air strikes, we were told that there were 300 deaths, 350 deaths
 lekin maine neuyork times or washington post main aisi khabaren padhin jinamein kaha gaya ki koi insaan nahin maaraa gaya
 Another foreign media report said only one person was injured
 "unhone kaha, "hamen yah jaanane kaa adhikaar he, is desh ke log yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki kitne maare gaye (balakot main)vastav main bam kahaan giraaya gaya tha? kya yah lakshya par gira tha?" isse pehle sarkari adhikariyon ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha vayusena ne pakistan ke khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa praant ke balakot main jaish-e-mohammad ke bade prashikshan shiviron par bam giraakar unhen tabah kar diya, jisamen 350 antkavaadi, unke prashikshak or bade commander maare gaye
 In fact, on 26 February, in order to avenge the Pulwama terror attack, India attacked the terrorist bases of Jaish, which were on the Pakistani soil
 bhartiya vayusena ne mangalvaar subah pakistan ke balakot main jaish e mohammad ke aatanki shivi par bam giraae the or kareeb 300 aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 During this time India used about 12 Mirage fighter jets and rained 1000 kg bombs
 iske baad pakistan kii baukhalaahat saamne aane lagi or usne bharat ke daawey ko khaarij karne kii koshish kii
 Tensions between the two countries have escalated since India's airstrike over terrorist targets
 haalanki, airstrike ke baad bharat ne isaki soochna tamaam deshon ko de di
 VIDEO: Press conference of the three armies: We did what we wanted to do modi sarkaar ne saamaanya varg ke garibon ke liye 10 pratishat kota dene kaa faisla kiya he
 The bill related to this has been passed in the Lok Sabha and is being debated in Rajya Sabha
 is bich ek mahatvapurn sawaal yah uthaaya ja rahaa he ki kya yah kanoon court main tik paaegaa? ye sawaal isliye he kyonki supreme court ye baat saaf kar chukaa he ki aarakshan kisi bhi surat main 50 fisadi se zyada nahin ho saktaa jabaki centre sarkaar dwaara saamaanya varg ke garib chaatro ke liye 10 fisadi siten arakshit karne se aarakshan 60 fisadi tak ho jaataa he
 On Tuesday, while intervening in the debate on the bill in the Lok Sabha, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley explained the government's reasoning in this regard
 jetali ne kaha ki supreme court ne 50 fisadi kii jo seemaa lagaai he wo seemaa keval jati aadhaarit aarakshan ke liye lagaai he
 The reason behind this was the feeling of the court that at least 50 per cent seats for the general class should be left or else there would be discrimination against the other class to revive one class
 jetali ke mutabik is lihaaj se maujuuda bilsupreme courtke nirnay kii bhaavana ke khilaaf nahin he
 Because it is giving 10 percent reservation to the general category, keeping in mind the interest of 50 percent limit has been fixed
 isi tark ke hisaab se sarkaar ko ummid he ki uskaa bill supreme court kii pariksha main paas ho jayega
 What was the decision of the Supreme Court In the Indira Sawhney case, the Supreme Court had said that in no case can there be more than 50 percent reservation because on the one hand we have to take care of merit and on the other hand we have to look at social justice
 isi main ek khaas baat justise jivan reddy ne uthaai ki kuch halaat main sarkaar 50 fisadi kii seemaa rekha ko laangh sakati he
 Opponents, who are opposing the government's reservation bill as a fraud with the general category, argue that the government is misinterpreting the Supreme Court's decision
 court ne 50 fisadi se zyada aarakshan na hone dene kii baat isliye kahi thi, taaki kam se kam aadhi siten merit ke aadhaar par bhari jaaen
 If the quota of 10 per cent was fixed for the poor of the general category, then only 40 per cent seats for merit would be left which would be against the decision of the court
 yahi vajah he ki ye bill supreme court main nahin tik paaegaa

 ) rajdhani dilli main bhale hi loksabhaa kii sirf 7 siten hai lekin desh kii kursi ke saath in 7 siton kaa ajab sa sanyog judaa hua he
 The electoral history of the last 21 years tells that in the riots of these 7 seats, whichever party won the hearts of the people of Delhi got the chair of the country
 dilli kii sabhi saaton siton par ek saath 12 may ko chathe charan main vot daale jaaenge
 In Delhi, the competition has been generally between the Congress and the BJP, but the contest is triangular due to the Aam Aadmi Party being in the fray
 rajdhani main loksabhaa kii 7 siten ye hai- nai dilli, north west dilli, pashchimi dilli, purvi dilli, uttar pashchim dilli, chandani chowk or dakshin dilli
 In 2014, BJP won these seven seats
 bijepi ko 46
 4% of the votes were received
 jabaki congress ko 15
 1 and 32 to the Aam Aadmi Party
 9% vot mili
 In 1951, when the first elections in the country were held, Delhi had 4 Lok Sabha seats
 1967 main siten 7 ho gayi
 But the real turning point in the politics of Delhi came 21 years ago in 1998 when BJP won 6 out of 7 seats
 keval ek seat congress ke khate main gai
 The BJP won the Delhi battle, the government was also formed at the center and Atal Bihari Vajpayee became the Prime Minister
 1999 main phir se desh main chunaav hue
 In this election for the 13th Lok Sabha, BJP again won all the seven seats
 centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii phir sarkaar bani
 After this, the Congress managed to win 6 seats in the 2004 elections and BJP got only one seat
 centre kii kursi par bhi badlaav hua
 Dr
 At Center replacing Atal Sarkar manmohan singh ke netritv main upie sarkaar bani
 The Congress was again successful in the 2009 elections and managed to win all 7 seats
 isi ke saath centre main bhi upie-2 sarkaar bani
 But in 2014, the voters of Delhi changed their support base and put all seven seats in bjp's bag
 2014 main dilli kaa siyaasi mizaaj badla to desh kii kursi par bhi badlaav hua or centre main narendra modi sarkaar bani
 The political battle of 2019 was a long-running battle of Congress versus BJP in Delhi
 lekin aam aadmi party ke aane se muqabla trikoniya ho gaya he
 For the first time in 2014, the Aam Aadmi Party entered the Lok Sabha elections but could not win any seats
 haalanki aam aadmi party ko 32
 9% votes were definitely received
 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav main 70 main se 67 siten aam aadmi party ne jiti thi
 This time the party is fighting on seven seats
 congress or bijepi ne bhi 7 siton kaa daanv jeetne ke liye puraa dam laga rakhaa he
 Compared to which seat? 1
 nai dilli-minakshi lekhi(vartmaan saansad)-bijepi, ajay maakan-congress, brajesh goyal-aam aadmi party se
 2
 purvi dilli-gautam gambhir-bijepi, arvinder singh lavali-congress, atishi marlena-aam aadmi party

 dilli kii in 7 siton ke liye siyaasi ladaai main in teen dalon ke alaava kai or dal tathaa nirdaleey ummidavaar bhi maidan main hai
 a total of 349 candidates from all the parties have enrolled
 lekin muqabla in teen dalon ke bich hi mana ja rahaa he

 Can India and Pakistan ever unite? Are the people who snatched peace between the two countries separate from the political community?

 main videsh mantri ke rup main baar-baar yahi kahati thi ki koi bhi baat aakhri nahin hoti, hamane yahi dekha he ab tak
 We took a bus to Pakistan, got Kargil infiltration in return
 yahaan sabko lagata he ki dosti ke badale udhar se goli aati he?hina:pakistan main sabaki ye soch he ki agar ham aapako nuksaan pahunchaate hai, to hamen bhi nuksaan pahunchataa he
 In Islam, the status of neighbor is more than relative
 hamane in nafaraton vaali baton ko kinare kiya
 Both these states
 hindustan or pakistan ne, donon ne apane yuvaaon main ek-duusare ke liye nafrat paidaa kar di he
 What have we achieved in these 60 years
 aap jin logon kii baat karte hai, unhen pakistan kii mukhyadhara ne khaarij kar diya he
 There is no benefit or support from doing evil in India in the elections there
 aap mind set kii baat kar rahi hai
 Hafiz Saeed, the perpetrator of the Mumbai attack, roams the streets of Lahore
 agar pakistan sanjeeda he, to use pakadakar hamaare hawaale kar dete
 It would have been a big deal
 hina:dekhie, meraa tay respons to ye hona chahie tha ki aapkaa or hamaara system ek sa he kamobesh to aapako pataa hona chahie ki kya kya dikkatein aati hai
 Now look at the Samjhauta Express blasted here in India
 kya usamen logon ko justise mil chukaa he
 Hafiz Saiz was twice detained
 phir hai court main use bari kar diya gaya
 Every time we asked Hindustan to give us strong evidence
 pakistan main aam pakistani hafiz said ko kabool nahin kiya ja saktaa
 But the main stream in India also hates Pakistan
 hafiz said par aapaki kya raay he?hina:main unase sahamat nahin hum
 Their thoughts are not in the interest of Pakistan
 unki harakatein galat hai, ninda karne yogya hai
 Does the General intervene in the decisions of the Government of Pakistan? Hina: We all worked together to build consensus on India during our reign
 aapaki sarkaar pentagon se lekar har jagah apane raajnneetik vichaar rakhti he
 There is pressure from many institutions in making decisions here too
 main jab videsh mantri thi, to akasar yah kahati thi ki ye tark dena band kariye ki india ne nahin kiya, to ham nahin karenge
 i used to say what is wrong in taking a good step first
 kya iesai sarkaar ke kabje main he?hina:ye intelligence hameshaa civil government ke under main aata he, aana chahie
 Earlier we had a military coup several times
 magar ab halaat badal rahe hai
 You too should see this changing scene
 aap sirf negative par focus nahin kar sakate
 Sharif said during the election, we will be friends with India
 magar unki sarkaar aane ke baad se seemaa par tanaav badha he
 So statements are few and actions are something else
 
 
 hina:simple sa jawaab he, elosi par donon hi said se log mar rahe hai
 What is the solution for this? aapako lagata he ki hamaari taraf se uksaaya gaya
 On our side, India is doing
 ab iske pher main kya har str par roak den
 When LOC attacks were going viral on Indian TV everywhere
 hamaare khilaaf chargeshit taiyaar kii ja rahi thi
 So we also had a child's corpse being seen everywhere, who was killed in LOC firing
 to kya hamane sab roak diya?aapke army chif
 The PM, the Home Minister and the Leader of the Opposition started making war-related statements
 hamaare yahaan sawaal uthne lage ki kya aap bujdil or darpok hai, jo jawaab nahin de rahe
 We just issued a statement that we have to return to the level of dialogue
 kya aapako lagata he ki pakistan main kuch log bharat ke saath dosti nahin chaahate or aisi har koshish ko kharaab karne kii firaaq main rahete hai?hina:donon said main aise log hai, jo shanti hone nahin dena chaahate
 i believe that according to the thinking and propaganda of these few people, the majority should not give their opinion
 pakistan main kattarpanth ke himachati log kinare pade hai, magar aapke yahaan menstream political party or media house is tarah ke vishavaman main shaamil hai
 During the elections in Pakistan, everyone had to talk about friendship with India
 magar is badlaav ko aap log tarjeeh nahin dena chaahate
 The mainstream of Pakistan has changed
 phir aap daaud ibrahim ko saunp kyon nahin dete?hina:mujhe nahin pataa ki daaud kahaan hai
 There are institutions between India and Pakistan, which act on such issues
 sansthaaen hai, jo in mushkilon ko hal kar sakati hai
 We should not decide things according to the noise of media
 daaud ke bare main ham shuru se maang kar rahe hai, saboot de rahe hai
 Hina: i think we still confined ourselves to the statements
 aap or baat chhod den
 You know 139 soldiers died a year and a half ago from today
 kya wo aapane maare the
 On your behalf, soldiers also die in Siachen
 iske liye koun jimmedaar he
 We have posted them there
 jab ham pahaado ko khaali chhodte hai, aapaki sena ke log, mujahid vahaan aakar baithte hai
 Hina: Because of this belief, the matter does not proceed
 aap kargil kii baat karte hai
 We can say Siachen
 ek insaan jo pakistan main mashhoor nahin he
 Not popular, his trial is going on
 uski aad lekar rishte behatar na karnaa kahaan kii baat he
 Believe in everything you do
 pakistan dosti karnaa chahta he
 It was accepted
 hina:dekhie agenda tivi channel tay nahin karte
 We are trying meraa vash chalata to daaud or hafiz jaise log pakistan se uth chuke hote
 i believe that if you obey heart and mind in exchange for concession and keep your thinking clear, then Insha Allah will fulfill its purpose
 aman behaal hoga
 What was the political atmosphere like after you became the foreign minister? Hina: i did not pay any attention to such things
 mujhe bharat main pakistan ke ucchayukta salmaan bashir kii salaah yaad he
 Be natural and maintain your confidence as a woman
 hamane apane raaj main ye khyaal rakhaa
 We tried to change the atmosphere
 puure jokhim uthaakar
 You see, the way we Indians in Pakistan are respected
 swaagat karte hai
 Malala Yousafzai is in the news
 vah raajnneeti main aana chaahati hai 
 Does it have a place in Pakistan? Hina: i have been in the main stream politics of Pakistan for ten years
 vahaan aurat hone ke naate aapako zyada maukey milte hai
 Made me a foreign minister in the first place
 hamane neshnal assembly kii spikar ek aurat ko banaaya
 Your critics say that under the new law your father could not contest elections due to not being a graduate and you got his place
 auron ke saath aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Hina: i will not register disagreements at all
 ye puure south asia main hota he
 You also have such families here
 malala yusufajai kii baat karun to vah ek shandaar rajdoot hai
 It is true that she reminds me of the worst, not the best
 magar ye yaad dilaanaa hi hamen behatari kii prerana de saktaa he
 How do you rate the Sharif government on the issue of relations with India? Hina: Clap rings with both hands
 hamen aapasi maahaul behatar karnaa hoga
 Unless you create a demand for friendship
 uski jarurat paidaa nahin karenge
 Until then, people's thinking will not change
 aap log ek khyaal ko shuru karte hai
 Then he cemented it
 badlaav bhi hai
 The hope of peace is more popular here
 
 
 chunaav ham sabakaa hayhalia vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ke paksh main chunaav nattejey aate dikh rahe hai
 Do you think that if Narendra Modi of this party later becomes PM
 kya asar hoga?hina: abhi is par jajment kol dena sahi nahin hoga
 Elections are yet to be held
 lanbaa vakt he
 If there is a demand for friendship with Pakistan in the country
 to kya dikkat he
 If Modi is saying that Manmohan is wearing a bangle in the case of Pakistan
 or modi chunaav jitate hai, to ye memaurity kii soch dikhaata he
 Then the same thing happened that mainstream thinking has to be changed
 kargil shahid vijayant thapar ke pita karan thapar kaa sawaal: kya non state players kii aad main kuch log bure kaamon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Sometimes a soldier is beheaded
 nafrat kii shuruyaat aise hi vaakyon se hoti he
 Hina: Look, i said that our soldiers were martyred on the LOC incident
 aapaki taraf se yuddh kii baaten shuru ho gayi
 We made peace by rejecting Pakistan's popular demand
 aapse kaha ki baatcheet kii mej par aaen
 You talked about non-state players, so we are facing it the most
 hamaare sainik, adhikari mar rahe hai
 We are not supporting it
 hedlins today ke nalin mehta kaa sawaal: pakistan main bhartiya filmon ko bain kar diya gaya he
 Hina: See the court just said that new films should not be released till the licensing process is completed
 ab isaki vyakhya is tarah se ho rahi he ki bhartiya filmon ko roak diya gayahedlins today ke gaurav saavant kaa sawaal: agar sarkaron kii baatcheet kaamyaab nahin hoti, to kya bharat or pakistan kii phujon ko aapas main baat kerani chahie?hina: bharat yaa pakistan main military ko ek alag ikai ke rup main kyon dekhte hai
 We have left the military coup behind
 jis tarah se videsh mantralay ek duusare ke sampark main rahete hai
 In the same way, the army should also keep in touch
 ye bharam dur karnaa hoga ki pakistani fouj bharat se shanti chaahati hi nahin he

 netaaon kaa avaidh khanan kaarobaariyon ko sangrakshan hone ke baavjood gaur ne kaha he ki unhone is kaarobaar ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaane kaa nirnay le liya he
 This is the reason that 10 companies of security forces have been deployed in this area
 gaur ne kaha ki chambal ilaake main jab bhi police avaidh khanan kaarobaariyon ke khilaaf karrwai karti he to us par bahubaliyon dwaara hamale kara die jate hai

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke dwaara lalu yadav ko chhodkar bijepi kaa daaman tham lene ke baad jediu ke varisht netaa sharad yadav guuruuvaar ko apane agle kadam kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 According to sources, Sharad Yadav has sharpened the rebel tone
 guuruuvaar ko unhone dilli ke constitution club main 'sajhi viraasat bachaao' naam se ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya he, jisamen tamaam vipakshi netaaon ko nyotaa bheja gaya he
 It is believed that Sharad Yadav may announce a non-political platform on Thursday with some of his supporters, including MP Ali Anwar, through which he will continue the inner war against Nitish Kumar
 sutron ke mutabik, sharad yadav ne baagi tevar tej kiye hai or 19 agast ko vah or ali anwar patna jaaenge jahaan vah shrikrishna memorial haul main 11 baje 'jan adaalat sammelan' karenge
 Sharad Yadav was removed from the post of his parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha by Janata Dal United after showing rebellious attitude against Nitish Kumar
 unke saath nitish kumaar ke khilaaf baghawat karne vaale rajyasabha ke saansad ali anwar ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii gai
 In Bihar, 21 leaders close to Sharad Yadav were expelled from the party as they had joined Sharad Yadav's yatra
 party se nikaale gaye netaaon main purv mantri or dalit netaa ramai ram bhi shaamil the jinhen sharad yadav camp kaa mana jaataa he
 Sharad Yadavpuri is busy with life for the common heritage Save Conference on Thursday so that he can establish his identity as the leader who unites the opposition
 iske liye biaar ambedkar ke padpote prakaash ambedkar ko bhi bulaayaa gaya he or maharashtra ke kisaan netaa raju shetty ko bhi, jinaki sanstha swabhimani shetakari sanghathan endie ke saath thi, lekin aajkal endie se uske sambandh thik nahin chal rahe hai
 Sharad Yadav has also called Ghulam Nabi Azad of Congress and also CPM leader Sitaram Yechury
 lekin sipiem isamen hissaa legaa yaa nahin, isko lekar abhi sanshay bana hua he
 On Wednesday, Sharad Yadav said in a press conference that he has called all the leaders of the opposition to the Common Heritage Rescue Conference
 buudhvaar ko unke press conference main khaas baat yah rahi ki unhone kai baar puche jane ke baavjood nitish kumaar ke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin bolaa or sirf itnaa kaha ki unka yah sammelan kisi ke khilaaf nahin he balki desh kii sajhi viraasat bachaane kii koshish he
 He said incidents of farmer suicides like Rohit Vemula and attacks on Dalits in Una prompted him to call the convention
 lalu kii raily main gaye to hogi dikkataudhar buudhvaar ko jediu ke netaa kasee tyaagi ne sharad yadav ke conference ke bare main kaha kii sharad yadav agar desh kii sajhi viraasat bachaane ke liye logon ko lamaband karte hai to unhen isse koi dikkat nahin he
 But if Sharad Yadav participates in Laloo Yadav Kirali to be held in Patna on 27 August, then there will be no place for him in JDU
 khaas baat yah he ki jediu bhi 19 taarikh ko patna main party kii baithak karne ja rahaa he, jisamen aupchaarik rup se jediu ke endie main shaamil hone kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 The leaders of the Sharad Yadav camp claimed that they had the support of 14 JDU state units, but KC Tyagi said that only five JDU state units were recognized in the Election Commission and four of them were with Nitish Kumar
 Huh
 haalanki sharad yadav ko party se nikaale jane ke bare main puche jane par ek baar phir kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki sharad yadav jediu ke varisht netaa hai or ham nahin chaahate ki unke khilaaf party ko koi bhi kadam uthaanaa pade
 But for this they will have to break ties with a corrupt leader like Lalu Yadav

 However, shortly after this, the bjp's figure again came down to 96
 kuch samay baad jab bijepi 99 seat par aage dikhne lagi to sabaki nazren is seat yani modasa par tik gai
 Due to this Modasa seat of North Gujarat, BJP could not make a century of seats
 matganana ke antim daur main sirf saat siton ke nattejey aane baaki the or bijepi ko kul 99 siten hi milti dikh rahi thim
 The result of the Modasa seat continued to fluctuate throughout the day and the contest between the two forks in both candidates
