 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is well aware that he has created history with the second consecutive victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 is lihaaj se janadesh ke samarthan main unki kootnithik, prashasnic or siyaasi gatividhiyaan to samaj main aati hai, par 'man kii baat 2
 The way he mentions books, book culture and Hindi writers in the first episode of '0' is not only indicating his literary love, but also how despite his busyness he is not only self-taught, literary works We are giving importance to them, but by referring to them, we are also trying to orient others in this direction
 pradhanmantri modi ne desh kii janata se radio par yojit hone vaale is bahucharchit samvaad main khaasaa vakt pustak charchaa par diya
 During this, he recounted Munshi Premchand and his many stories
 haalanki pradhanmantri pehle bhi pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke peeche munshi premchand kii kahani 'idgah' or uske nayak hamid kaa zikr kar chuke hai
 But this time the way he talked to crores of countrymen is not only a pleasant sign for the world, but is also foreshadowing a new campaign to take the country and countrymen towards education, literature and culture
 pradhanmantri ne 'man kii baat' main kitabon par apni baat yon rakhi- "mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, aapane kai baar mere munh se suna hoga, 'buke nahin book', meraa aagrah tha ki kya ham swaagat-satkar main phulon ke bajaay kitaaben de sakate hai
 Since then people have started giving books to many places
 mujhe haal hi main kisi ne ‘premchand kii lokapriy kahaniyaan’ naam kii pustak di
 i felt very good
 haalanki, bahut samay to nahin mil paaya, lekin pravaas ke dauraan mujhe unki kuch kahaniyaan phir se padhane kaa mauka mil gaya
 "while reading Premchand's real depiction of society in his stories, his image starts to form in your mind
 unki likhi ek-ek baat jeevant ho uthati he
 His stories expressing human sensations in simple, simple language touched my mind as well
 unki kahaniyon main samooche bharat kaa manobhaav samahit he
 When i was reading a story called 'nasha' written by him, my mind automatically shifted to the economic inequalities prevailing in the society
 mujhe apni yuvavastha ke din yaad aa gaye ki kaise is vishay par raat-raat bhar bahes hoti thi
 The story of Zamindar's son Ishwari and the poor family's Bir learns that if you are not careful, then when the impact of bad association goes away, it is not known
 "duusari kahani, jisane mere dil ko andar tak chhu liya, vah thi ‘idgah’, ek balak kii samvedansheeltaa, uskaa apni daadi ke liye vishuddh prem, utani choti umr main itnaa paripakv bhav
 When Hamid, 4-5 years old, reaches his grandmother with a platter from the fair, then the human sympathy reaches its peak
 is kahani kii aakhri pankti bahut hi bhavuk karne vaali he kyonki usamen jivan kii ek bahut badi sachai he, 'bachche hamid ne buudhe hamid kaa part khelaa tha - budhiya ameena, balika ameena ban gai thi
 "" One such poignant story is 'pus Ki Raat'
 is kahani main ek garib kisaan jivan kii vidambnaa kaa sajiv chithran dekhne ko mila
 Even after its crop is destroyed, the haldu farmer is happy because now he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold winter
 haalanki ye kahaniyaan lagbhag sadi bhar pehle kii hai lekin inaki praasangikta, aaj bhi utani hi mahasoos hoti he
 After reading these, i had a different feeling
 "yaad rahe ki pradhanmantri pad saal 2014 unki tajposhi ke baad se hi unpar kitabon kii baadh si aa gai he
 According to an assessment, more than three hundred and fifty books have been written on them so far
 isi dauraan khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi schuli chaatro ko pariksha ke tanaav se bachaane ke liye ek kitaab likhi thi, jo anudit hokar kai bhashaaon main chhapi or uskaa kaaphi prasar bhi hua
 It is no surprise that the opposition that often questions the Prime Minister's degree is silent on literature, but the Prime Minister is trying to bring letters and studies back into the mainstream
 unhone apane is radio samvaad main aage kaha-"jab padhane kii baat ho rahi he, tabhi kisi media main, main kerala kii akshara librari ke bare main pard rahaa tha
 You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village nestled amidst the thick forests of Idukki
 yahan ke praathmik vidhyalay ke shikshak pi
 K
 muralidharan or choti si chaay kii dukaan chalaane vaale pi
 V
 chinnathampi, in donon ne, is librari ke liye athak parishram kiya he
 There was a time when books were brought here by stuffing them in bundles and loaded on the back
 aaj ye librari, adivasee bacchon ke saath har kisi ko ek nai raah dikhaa rahi he
 "prime Minister is speaking and Gujarat cannot be mentioned, it cannot happen
 apane grih rajya kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha, "gujarat main vaanche gujarat abhiyaan ek safal prayog rahaa
 Millions of people of every age group participated in this campaign of reading books
 aaj kii digital duniya main, Google guru ke samay main, main aapse bhi aagrah karunga ki kuch samay nikaalkar apane daily routine main kitaab ko bhi zarur sthaan den
 You will really enjoy it and write whatever book you read on the narendramodi App so that all the listeners of 'mann Ki Baat' will also know about it
 "spasht he, ek lambey antaraal ke baad desh ke pradhanmantri ne bina kisi academik aayojan ke padhane, or padhate hi rahane kii baat kahi he
 He should be praised for this
 aisa vahi kah saktaa he, jise shabdon kaa mahatva pataa ho or jo khud bhi aisi kavita likh saktaa ho
 Read this poem titled 'across the Picture' of Prime Minister Narendra Modi: If you don't try in vain to find me in my picture or poster, then i am sitting in the posture of Padmasana, in my confidence, in my voice and my workplace
 tum mujhe mere kaam se hi janotum mujhe chhavi main nahilekin paseene kii mahak main paoyojna ke vistaar kii mahak main thahromeri aawaaj kii goonj se pahachanomeri aankh main tumhaara hi pratibimb he
 ** The author of this poem is Narendra Modi
 yah kavita saal 2007 main gujarati main prakashit unke sankalan 'aankh aa dhanya che' main chhapi thi, jiskaa hindi anuwaad 'aankh ye dhanya he' naam se prakashit hua
 Anjana Sandhir put these poems in front of Hindi readers, and critic Ila Prasad described them as an expression of a burning heart in the heat of life
 sagar vidhansabha sitbijepika garh he
 BJP has been ruling here for the last 25 years
 yahaan abhi vidhayak hai shailendra jain, jo yahaan se 2008 or 2013 main jitkar aae the
 Sudha Jain was MLA in this seat before Shailendra Jain
 wo 1993, 1998 or 2003 main is seat par jeet darj karne main safal hui thi
 She has also been a minister in the Madhya Pradesh government, but in 2008 the party did not give her a ticket
 unki jagah shahar bijepi adhyaksh shailendra jain ko chunaa gaya
 Sushil Tiwari, who was from Sagar Vidhanasabha seat last time from Congress, is now with BJP
 ab unki jagah amit dube, navy jain, mukul purohit, bhoopendra singh muhaansaa, munna choube bhi apni daavedaari jataa rahe hai
 Talking about the ethnicization of Sagar, Thakur and Jain community have a significant influence here
 pichley chunaavon main dekha gaya he ki jain samudaay bijepi ke paksh main khadaa rahaa he
 Apart from this, the vote of Yadav, Muslim, OBC and Backward Classes is also decisive here
 monsoon se pehle hui barsaat main hi dilli ke kai ilaakon main logon ko jalairao kii samasya se jhujhna padaa
 Now BJP has blamed Kejriwal government for this
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke netritv main pratinidhimandal uparajyapal anil baijal se kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf shikaayat karenge
 The real BJP has alleged that the Delhi government's PWD department is responsible for the problem of incitement
 kyonki peedbludi ke naalon kii safai nahin hone kii vajah se ye pareshaani ho rahi he
 Also, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has also accused of rigging in the matter of cleaning drains
 dilli main peedblyoody ke antargat 1010 bade naale aate hai
 Of these, only 85 drains have been thoroughly cleaned
 250 se adhik ko to ab tak haath bhi nahin lagaaya gaya he
 In the remaining 700 drains, only cleanliness work has been carried out
 emsidi or dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody kaa takaraav jagajaahir he
 Obviously, whether there are small roads in Delhi or big roads under PWD, the problem is the same everywhere
 jaraa sibarish main jalabhrawaho jaataa he
 There is a tussle between the government's PWD department and the municipal corporation about this and people have to face a lot of trouble

 He told a newspaper that on the evening of 22 March, he received a call from an unknown number
 kol recorded aawaaj main thi ki wo bijepi ke praathmik sadsy ban chuke hai
 CPM leader said, 'when i disconnected the phone, a message came on my phone, welcome to BJP and also wrote the Membership number (1079741000) in the message
 'ham kahin nahin ja rahe: amit shahbijapi missd kol membership abhiyaan chalaa rahi he, jiske jariye wo duniya kii sabase badi party ban gai he
 Janardhana's husband, however, denies that he had made a missed call
 unhone daawa kiya ki recorded massej bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh kanak vardhan singh dev kii aawaaj main thi, aapkaa party main swaagat he
 He said, 'I did not make any message or call on my behalf
 'pichley do dashakon se sipiem kii central kamity ke sadsy janardan pati ab is maamle main chunaav ayog ko patr likhakar dakhal kii apil karne kii taiyaari main hai
 Addressing the rally at Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi said that the country has seen four types of governance, 'nampanthi', 'left', 'damnist' and now 'evolutionist'
 unhone kaha ki 'mahamilavati' dal vaishvik paridrishy main bharat kii badhati takat ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chaahate

 kya kisaanon kii aamadani vaaqai dugani ho jaaegi? is saal bhale na ho magar chah saal baad 2022 main ho jaaegi? pradhanmantri narendra modi apni kisaan reliyon main is baat par khaase jor de rahe hai ki unki sarkaar ke prayaason se chah saal baad kisaanon kii aamadani dabl ho jaaegi
 The Finance Minister has also reiterated this in his budget
 pehali baar kisaanon kii aamadani dugani hone kii baat kii ja rahi he or is par charchaa tak nahin
 Do you know what the farmers talk about day and night when they have been patient so much for six more years? kya pataa vaaqai inakam dabl ho jaae
 Will it really happen? There must be and why will not happen
 kya ham jaanate hai ki abhi kisaanon kii salanaa aamadani kitni he? aarthik surveykshan kii report main likhaa he ki desh ke 17 rajyon ke kisaanon kii salanaa aay bees hazaar rupee hai
 If you divide it in a month, then the monthly average income of crores of farmers is Rs 1662
 hamaara kisaan itane kam paise main kaise jeeta hoga yah sochna band hi kar dijiye to thik rahegaa
 Now if the Prime Minister is successful in his promise, then in 2022, this will double to Rs 3332
 mudrasphiti ko shaamil kar len to is raqam kii bhi koi haisiyat nahin rahegi
 If the Prime Minister is right, then is this not what he is saying that nothing can happen to farmers
 itani maamuli vruddhi main aisa kya khaas nazar aa rahaa he ki dabl inakam vaali baat par sarkaar itnaa jor de rahi he
 Even after six years, if it becomes Rs 3332 per month, then what will be the change in the economic condition of the farmers
 yah bhi saaf nahin ho paa rahaa he ki sarkaar kheti kii aamadani ko dabl kar degi yaa gramin kshetra main rahane vaale logon kii aamadani dabl kar degi
 The Prime Minister is taking the name of the farmer but only the farmer does not live in the village
 agar sarkaar kisaanon kii aamadani dabl hi karnaa chaahati he to fasalon kii laagat kaa pachaas fisadi jod kar daam dene kii baat kyon nahin karti? bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr ke pej 44 par likhaa he ki sunishchit kiya jayega ki laagat kaa pachaas fisadi laabh ho
 What should the government be doing to ensure this? It is not possible to see the condition of increase in support prices and there is no reduction in cost
 abhi jo samarthan mulya miltaa he usase bahut mushkil se laagat nikal paata he
 Has the government discovered any new formula, claiming to double the income on its own? agar aisa he to yahi baat saaf saaf kahi jaani chahie
 At times, it seems that the government is busy talking about everything except its promise
 sarkaar ekikrut bazaar kii baat karne lagi he
 There should be a complete improvement in the system of the market, but it is not yet clear that this will only increase the prices
 arthshaastri devendra sharma ne ek udhaaharan diya ki karnataka main do sau mandiyon ko ekikrut kiya gaya he phir bhi tamaato ke daam laagat se kam he
 There was talk of income commission for farmers during election discussions, that thing has also been lost in new dreams
 tippaniyan It is welcome to pay attention to the villages in this budget
 lekin har mad main chand hajaar karod kii vruddhi kar dene se hi manzil aasaan nahin hone vaali
 The development of infrastructure in villages will increase employment business opportunities but will not increase for everyone
 un jagahon par jaakar dekhnaa chahie jahaan sadaken acchhee hai or sinchai ke saadhan behatar
 Punjab can be an example
 vahaan kheti or kisaan kii haalat khasta he
 Therefore, farmers should keep a calculator with them
 abhi se jodna ghataana shuru kar dena chahie ki 2022 main uski aamadani dabl hone vaali he
 3332 rupees a month will be a lot, so he should start the practice of planning to spend
 dukhad he ki ham kisaanon ke paas slogan pahunchaa dete hai lekin slogan kaise saakaar hoga nahin bataate
 Every day a new slogan eats the old slogan
 kya vaaqai aisa ho jayega? zarur hona chahie or kyon nahin hoga
 Do we know what the annual income of farmers is right now? The Economic Survey report states that farmers in 17 states of the country have an annual income of twenty thousand rupees
 ise aap maheene main baantenge to karodon kisaanon kii masik ausat aay 1662 rupee hoti he
 Stop thinking about how our farmer would have won in such a small amount of money
 ab agar pradhanmantri apane vaade main safal rahe to saal 2022 main yahi dugani hokar 3332 rupee ho jaaegi
 If you include inflation, then this money will not have any status
 agar pradhanmantri ji kaa kahana sahi he to kya ve yahi nahin kah rahe hai ki kisaanon kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 What is so special in such a slight increase is that the government is emphasizing so much on double income
 chah saal baad agar 3332 rupee prati maah ho bhi jaae to kisaanon kii aarthik sthiti main kya badlaav aayega
 It is also not clear whether the government will double farm income or double the income of people living in rural areas
 pradhanmantri to kisaan kaa hi naam le rahe hai magar gaanv main sirf kisaan nahin rahata he
 If the government wants to double the income of the farmers, then why not talk about giving the price by adding fifty percent of the cost of crops? The BJP has written on page 44 of its manifesto that it will be ensured that fifty per cent of the cost is benefited
 sarkaar bataaye ki ise sunishchit karne ke liye kya kar rahi he? samarthan mulyon main vruddhi kii haalat dekhakar to nahin lagata na hi laagat main koi kami ai he
 The support price we get right now is very difficult to extract the cost
 kya sarkaar ne koi nayaa farmula khoj liya he jiske dam par inakam dabl karne kaa daawa kar rahi he
 If this is the case then the same thing should be said clearly
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar apane us vaade ko chhod baaki baaten karne main lagi he
 The government has started talking about an integrated market
 bazaar ke system main bilkul sudhaar hona chahie lekin yah abhi saaf nahin he ki isse qimaton main oochaal hi aa jayega
 Economist Devendra Sharma gave an example that two hundred mandis have been integrated in Karnataka, yet tomato prices are below cost
 chunavi charchaaon ke dauraan kisaanon ke liye aay ayog kii baat chali thi wo baat bhi nae nae sapanom main kho chuki he
 The comments rahi baat is baar ke bajet main gaanvon kii taraf dhyaan dene kii to wo swaagat yogya he
 But with the increase of a few thousand crores in every item, the destination will not be easy
 gaanvon main buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas se rojgaar vyapaar ke avasar badhenge lekin sabake liye badhenge koi zaruri nahin
 Must visit places where the roads are good and the means of irrigation are better
 punjab ek udhaaharan ho saktaa he
 There the condition of farming and farmer is poor
 isaliye kisaanon ko apane paas ek calculator rakhana chahie
 From now on, it should start subtracting that his income is going to double in 2022
 maheene kaa 3332 rupaya bahut hoga isliye use kharch karne kii yojana banane kaa abhyaas shuru kar dena chahie
 It is sad that we deliver slogans to the farmers, but do not tell how the slogan will come true
 har din ek nayaa slogan puraane slogan ko kha jaataa he
 If the Prime Minister is right, then is this not what he is saying that nothing can happen to farmers
 itani maamuli vruddhi main aisa kya khaas nazar aa rahaa he ki dabl inakam vaali baat par sarkaar itnaa jor de rahi he

 All the encounters of UP Police have done similar encounters by Uttar Pradesh Police
 lagbhag har muthbhed main police kaa nishaanaa itnaa sateek rahaa ki badmaashon ke pair main hi goli lagi
 In almost every encounter, the police story seems to be similar
 sawaal ye he ki 100 main se 98 muthbhedon main badmaashon ke pair main hi goli kyon lagati he
 The Yogi government has given the UP Police an open exemption for the encounter of miscreants
 pashchimi uttar pradesh kii baat karen to meerut range police ne 1 janvari 2019 se lekar 11 sitambar 2019 tak yani 9 mahine main 674 encounter kiye

 Meerut range ADG Prashant Kumar said in the conversation till date that who is raising the question as to why the bullet is in the leg itself
 agar badmaash sawaal uthaate hai to koun badmaash police par sawaal nahin uthaata
 After the encounter, the miscreants who get shot in the leg
 unka aspataal main ilaaj karavaaya jaataa he
 He is then sent to jail
 bel milane par wo baahar aa jate hai or sabhi ke pair sahi salaamat hi rahete hai
 After the arrival of the Yogi government, the case of the encounter of the UP police was going to the Supreme Court
 haalanki upi police ne us par bhi jawaab de diya tha
 But the UP Chief Minister has given the UP Police an open leeway to shoot at the miscreants if necessary
 to sawaal uthta he ki kya police vaale apane number banane ke chakkar main badmaashon ko pakadakar pair main goli markar giraftaar karne ke aadi to nahin ho rahe hai

 i live with my four sons
 ve abhi bahut chote hai
 You can guess their age from this, that i do not have to worry now that they may have hidden an adult magazine under a mattress or secretly visited a porn site and then erased internet search history
 mujhe khushi he kifilhal mere bete abhi un jigyaasaaon ke chakkar main nahin pade hai
 But i fully realize that all this will happen very soon
 shaayad meri kalpana se bhi zyada jaldi
 (I mean i had not even thought about sex till the age of 25)
 )isliye main chaahati hum ki mere bachche mujhe nirvastr dekhen-1
 Because if i do not do this, then i do not know which woman they will see naked first
 shaayad kisi magazine yaa movie main, jiskaa sharir ho saktaa he ki parfect na ho
 So what would they expect? Which image of the woman will they live with? 2
 main chaahati hum ki mere bete puuchhen ki mere pet par nishaan kaise pade hai
 And i can tell them with pride how difficult it is to keep a child in the womb
 ve ho saktaa he ki mere deele pet ko dabaaen, lekin main bataanaa chaahati hum ki main unhen paalate hue is sharir ke saath khush hum
 3
 main nahin chaahati ki ve kisi mahila ke tane huestan ko hi adarsh maan len,jo ki shaayad kisi magazine main digitaly banaae gaye hon
 They should know that their size changes later, especially after the birth of children
 4
 i believe that my efforts will make children understand themselves and they will ask me to cover my body
 ek samay aayega, jab ve mere kamare main nock karke aaenge
 Till then i want to give them a chance to touch my body
 in anubhavon ke saath jab ve shaadi karenge
 After some age when their wives would say 'I wish our legs were a little thinner', my sons would reply that 'they are perfect as they are'

 Opener Mayank Agarwal said that after scoring a half-century on the first day of the second Test match against West Indies, his team is in excellent condition in the match
 bhartiya team ne agarwal ke 55 or viraat kohli ke 76 ranon kii badaulat din kaa khel samaapt hone tak paanch wicket ke nuksaan par 264 ran bana liye hai
 Aggarwal said, 'I felt there was movement in the ball in the first session
 kemar roach or holder ne shandaar gendbaaji kii
 Batting was not easy, there was a lot of moisture in the pitch and the ball was moving
 'agarwal ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki holder sahi jagahon par gendbaaji kar rahe hai, vah aapako ek inch bhi jagah nahin de rahe hai
 He does not give you a bad ball to score
 'unhone kaha, 'isliye dabaav hameshaa bana rahata he, bhale hi aap dephend karte rahen
 In the first spell, he bowled six-seven overs, of which three or four were maidens, so as a batsman you know that you cannot score more runs
 ham behtareen sthiti main hai
 Losing only five wickets on such a pitch was a good effort from our side

 Former Indian cricket captain Anil Kumble believes that India's spin department is full of level bowlers and he called Harbhajan Singh, who is returning to the team, one of the 'best spinners in the country'
 srilanka main chal rahe tii-20 world cap main team main vaapasi karne vaale harbhajan kii gairmaujuudagi main ravichandran aswin or pragyan ojha ne acchhee bhoomika nibhaai
 Harbhajan had to stay out of the team for a long time due to poor form
 test cricket main 619 wicket ke saath tisare sabase safal gendbaaj kumble ne kaha ki harbhajan singh behtareen gendbaaj he
 He also said that Ashwin is very patient bowler which is important for performing under pressure
 purv captain kumble kaa saath hi maananaa he ki leg spinner amit mishra, rahul sharma or piyush chawla ko bhi paryaapt maukey milane chahie
 Talking about the country's leading spinners, Kumble said that the spin bowling attack of Ashwin, Harbhajan and Ojha is very strong
 kumble ne kaha, ‘agar aap spinner ko paryaapt maukey nahin doge to aapako uski asli kshamta ke bare main kabhi pataa nahin chalegaa
 The spin department is quite strong at the moment as there are two spinners (ashwin and Ojha) who are doing well on the field
 ’kumble ne kaha, ‘harbhajan singh bhi maujuud hai, jise 400 test wicket hasil karne kaa anubhav he or jo kaaphi pratispardhi he
 When he returns to his best form, you will have three good spinners in the team and in addition three leg spinners are trying to make a place in the team
 ’ kumble ne kaha ki harbhajan ab bhi rashtriya team main kaaphi yogadan de sakate hai
 England cricket team captain Kevin Pietersen and coach Moores have resigned from their posts

 Peterson and Moores' working relationship soured when the selection committee member coach ignored former captain Michael Vann to tour the West Indies against Peterson's will
 haalanki is rishte main kaaphi pehle kadavaahat aa gai thi
 Peterson reportedly does not respect Moores
 moors ko vah ausat coach maanate hai
 The England and Wales Cricket Board had given managing director Hugh Morris the responsibility of reconciliation between the two and Peterson was in favor of resolving the issue before the West Indies tour

 On Wednesday, she appeared before the Rajya Sabha's Privileges Committee on this statement and said that she stands by her statement
 jarur padhein: jaaniye koun hai sadhvi prachiapako yaad hoga kisadhvi prachike is bayaan par kaaphi bavaal machaa tha
 Samajwadi Party MP Naresh Aggarwal had complained about the matter to the Committee of Privileges in Rajya Sabha
 sadhvi praachi ne buudhvaar ko visheshadhikaar samiti ke saamne is bayaan par maafee maangane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The Privileges Committee asked Sadhvi to apologize
 Sadashvi Prachi appeared before the Privileges Committee along with her lawyer
 cameti ke adhyaksh pije courian ne unase kaha ki vah apane bayaan ke liye maafee maange or yah vaada karen karegi ab se vah aisi baat nahin karenge
 But the committee members were surprised when Sadhvi Prachi flatly refused to apologize and bluntly said that she stood by her point
 sadhvi boleen- main darane vaali nahinvisheshadhikaar samiti kii meeting se baahar aakar sadhvi praachi ne kaha ki un par dabaav banane kii puri koshish kii gai lekin wo darane vaali nahin he
 Sadhvi Prachi reiterated her charge that what else can be said about those who are not ready to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai and want to cut the country? The Privileges Committee in its next meeting will decide what action should be taken against Sadhvi Prachi
 pehle bhi vivaadit bayaan detii rahi hai sadhvisadhvi praachi apane bayanon ko lekar lagaataar vivaad main rahati hum
 Earlier, he had also said that people should boycott all three Khan's films as their films promote love jihad
 anupam kher se bhi unki tu-tu main-main hui thi jab anupam kher ne yah kaha tha ki sadhvi praachi jaise logon ko jail bhej dena chahie

 In the UP Rajya Sabha elections, a lot of vigor is going on between BJP and SP-BSP
 is bich raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya ke vot na daalane kii khabar aa rahi he
 Actually, Raghuraj has cast his vote for the Samajwadi Party and is about to cast his vote as the 37th voter, but now a candidate needs 36 votes to win
 aise main raghuraaj pratap singh kaa 37 main se vot kaa kuch pratishat BSP ko ja saktaa he, isiilie aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki wo vot nahin daalenge
 But he later voted
 iske baad wo siem yogi adityanath ke saath mulaakaat kii
 It was believed that 398 mlas would do it in the Rajya Sabha elections

 In such a situation, 36 votes will now be required to select a Rajya Sabha member
 lekin aisa nahin hua soobe ke 400 vidhayakon ne matdaan kiya
 Please tell that the BSP has so far received a total of 34 votes
 isamen basapa ke 17 vot, 10 vot samaajawaadee party ke or 7 vot congress ke shaamil hai
 Right now the BSP needs at least 2 to 3 votes to win

 anil singh unnav ke purava vidhansabha se vidhayak hai
 Been close to BJP before also
 bijepi se tikat nahin milane par bispi se chunaav lade or jite
 Why is Raghuraj Pratap Singh shying away from voting for BSP It is worth mentioning that Mayawati took a very aggressive stand against Raghuraj Pratap Singh during the BSP government in UP in 2002
 or raghuraaj ko jail bhijwane ke saath unki aapraadhik gatividhiyon ko rokane ke liye kadaa ection liya tha
 Not only this, along with sending police to his palatial house, a lot of confiscation was also done
 iske baad 2007 main bhi mayawati ne raghuraaj pratap singh ke khilaaf kadaa ruukh apanaae rakhaa
 This is the reason why Raghuraj is reluctant to vote for the BSP candidate
 bataa den ki raghuraaj ke khilaaf hatya sahit kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai

 haalanki england kii shuruyaat kharaab rahi or 15 over ke bheetar hi unke 72 ran par chaar wicket gir chuke the

 team india ke vyast shedul or england ke khilaaf siries main ab tak ke prabhavi pradarshan ko dekhte hue chayankartaaon ne ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja ko aaraam diya or unki jagah mishra or rasul ko mauka dene kaa nirnay diya he
 Talking about Amit Mishra, everyone is aware of his bowling skills
 daaen haath kaa yah spinner apane 'verieshans' se kisi bhi team ke ballebaaji kram ko dhwast karne kii kshamta rakhata he
 In this sense, they were definitely entitled to the opportunity
 haalanki pradarshan main sthirataa nahin hone ke kaaran ve team se andar-baahar hote rahe hai
 Very few people will remember that Amit Mishra had given a memorable victory to the Indian team in his last match of short format, bowling charismatic
 oktober 2016 main khele gaye is vanade match main 'mishri' ne kiwi ballebaaji kram ko dhwast karke rakh diya tha
 In this match, Amit took five wickets for just 18 runs and played a decisive role in Team India's 3–2 series victory
 yahi nahin, newjiland ke khilaaf is siries main ve main of da match or main of da siries bhi rahe the
 The selection of 27-year-old all-rounder Parvez Rasool is a bit surprising, but the Jammu and Kashmir player has also proved his talent on the number of occasions
 (padhein, isliye thode niraash hai jammu-kashmir ke harfanmaulaa parvej rasul) In addition to spin bowling with right hand, Parvez Rasool also bats well
 team india ke mahaan spinner bishan singh bedi parvej rasul ko pratibha se bharpoor gendbaaj maanate hue unki prashansa kar chuke hai
 Bedi has contributed significantly in making Rasool's bowling sharper
 ek vanade match main team india kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke rasul ko gharelu cricket main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne kaa inaam mila he or ve nishvith rup se is maukey ke hakdaar the
 Rasul specializes in bowling wicket-to-wicket and they do not allow the ball to fly much
 is lihaaj se vanade or tii20 main ve upyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 The comments vaise bhi gharelu cricket main chamak dikhaane ke baad parvej rasul ko team india main jagah milane kii maang unke rajya jammu-kashmir main jorshor se uthati rahi he
 Former state CM Omar Abdullah has also been included in the demand
 varsh 2013 main jab rasul ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf paanchaven or antim van-de match main bhi antim ekadash main jagah nahin mili to umr abdulla ne niraashaa jataai thi
 Omar had tweeted whether Rasool was taken to Zimbabwe only to drop his morale
 yah kaam to desh main bhi aasaani se ho saktaa tha
 Former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor and sports critic Ayaz Memon also questioned the decision not to give Rasool a chance in the playing XI at that time
 parvej ne ab tak team india kii ore se ek vanade khelte hue do wicket hasil kiye hai
 By the way, his record of domestic cricket is very effective
 58 pratham shrenee maichon main ve 38
 Has scored more than three thousand runs at an average of 87 which includes eight centuries
 yahi nahin, pratham shrenee maichon main 156 wicket bhi is khilaadi ke naam par darj hai
 Parvez also has 478 runs and 27 wickets in 37 T20 matches (not international)
 
 
 kam hi logon ko yaad hoga ki amit mishra ne shorter formet ke apane pichley match main hi karishmai gendbaaji karte hue bhartiya team ko yaadgaar jeet dilaai thi
 In this ODI match played in October 2016, 'mishri' demolished the Kiwi batting order
 is match main amit ne mahaj 18 ran dekar paanch wicket liye the or team india kii 3-2 kii siries jeet main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Not only this, he was also Man of the Match and Man of the Series in this series against New Zealand
 27 varshiya harfanmaulaa parvej rasul kaa chayan jarur kuch hairaan kar rahaa he lekin jammu-kashmir ke is khilaadi ne bhi hasil hue maukon par apni pratibha kaa loha manvaaya he
 (read, so i am a little disappointed that all-rounder Parvez Rasool of Jammu and Kashmir) parvej rasul daaen haath se spin gendbaaji ke alaava acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar lete hai
 Team India's great spinner Bishan Singh Bedi has praised Parvez Rasool as a bowler full of talent
 rasul kii gendbaaji ko dhardaar banane main bedi kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 Rasool, who represented Team India in a one-day match, has been rewarded for his consistently good performance in domestic cricket and he certainly deserved the opportunity
 rasul wicket-tu-wicket gendbaaji karne main maahir he or ve gend ko zyada flite nahin karaate
 In this context, they can prove useful in odis and T20s
 tippaniyan Anyway, after showing the glow in domestic cricket, the demand for Parvez Rasool to get a place in Team India has been loudly rising in his state of Jammu and Kashmir

 Ramuwalia, who was a minister with SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in the government of Deve Gowda and Indra Kumar Gujral, has now become the 'leader of the leader' in the politics of UP

 This is the reason that during the last two years, the cabinet minister of the most disputed mining department in the state, Gayatri Prasad Prajapati was successful in getting the pardon due to the choice of Mulayam Singh
 vahiin duusare sabase vivaadaaspad netaa gonda se vidhayak or sapa sarkaar main madhyamik shiksha rajyamantri rahe vinod kumaar singh urf pandit singh ko mulaayam singh kii najdiki kaa phayda mila

 itnaa hi nahin, 31 aktubar ko hue mantrimandal vistaar main apane pasand ke netaaon ko pramukhataa dilaakar (dekhen box) mulaayam singh ne saaf kar diya ki ve 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle akhilesh yadav ko 'free-hand' dene ke mood main nahin hai
 Now it is also clear that in the next assembly elections, the face of SP will be Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, but the election war will be fought by Mulayam's warlord

 In the first week of October, he has met Akhilesh Yadav along with other top SP leaders and prepared the rallies
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, ''ye reliyaan loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle hui-desh bachaao, desh banaao kii tarj par hongi
 But this time the entire focus will be on publicizing the achievements of the SP government
 '' panchayat chunaav ke fouran baad ye reliyaan pradesh ke sabhi mandal mukhyalayon par hongi or inamen mukhya vaktaa ke rup main mulaayam singh hi maujuud rahenge
 For this, two books are being distributed to the district level leaders of the party from the SP headquarters
 inamen ek kitaab main akhilesh yadav sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa zikr he to duusari main centre kii bijepi sarkaar ke adhure vaadon kaa bahikhaata he
 SP spokesperson and cabinet minister Rajendra Chaudhary says, "through these books, the achievements of the state government have been mentioned which could not find a place even in the media
" inhen padhakar party ke netaa janata ke saamne sapa kaa paksh bakhubi rakh sakenge
 Not only this, the party is going to organize special camps at the district level soon to empower the leaders in telling the achievements of the SP government in news channels and in public
 inamen sapa ke varisht netaa or export jilastareey netaaon ko prabhavi bhaashan dene kii tarkiben suzaayenge
 Factionalism challenge: Before going to the next assembly elections, Mulayam Singh is also busy in fighting the opposing camps within the party

 yahi vajah thi ki 1 aktubar ko agarwal ne hardoi main apana janmdin 'kaumi ekta sammelan' ke taur par manaaya tha

 However, the manner in which Cabinet Lok Sabha leader Amar Singh has shown favor in the expansion of the cabinet, there is a lot of resentment in Azam Khan's camp

 Mulayam Singh has devised a special strategy this time to keep the new ministers included in the balance of cabinet through options
 party ke ek rashtriya mahasachiv bataate hai, ''mantrimandal main shaamil kiye gaye nae mantriyon ke jile se hi duusare gut ke netaaon ko bhi tavajjo di gai he taaki ye mantri aisi sthiti main na aa saken ki party ke liye aprihaary ho jaaen

 is baar ke mantrimandal vistaar main bhi aisa hi he
 The real challenge to Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was trying to spark the image of Akhilesh Yadav by creating a ruckus among ministers, came the next day, when SP councilor Bantu Yadav was shot at some distance from his residence on 1 November
 aparaadhiyon ke buland hausalon ne yah sanket bhi de diya ki sudhari kanoon vyavastha ke liye mulaayam ko nae sire se prayaas karnaa hoga
 Only then will the image of Akhilesh Yadav flourish
