 The Bharatiya Janata Party has released its first list for the Gujarat elections
 shuukravaar ko jari kii gai is list main kul 70 ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 The Gujarat election remains a question of credibility for the BJP, which is why the BJP is putting its dice in mind
 bijepi ne apni is list main 49 vidhayakon ko dobaaraa mauka diya he
 Leaders coming from the Congress have also been given tickets
 apni pehali list main bijepi ne jaateey sameekaran kaa puraa khyaal rakhaa he
 In the first list, how many tickets from which caste - Patidar - 15 Chaudhary - 2 Thakor - 8 Koli - 5 Kshatriyas - 6 Brahmins - 2 Jain - 2 In addition, BJP has given tickets to 4 women
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch samay se rajya main patidaar aarakshan ko lekar andolan chal rahe hai
 Due to the movement, Patidar leader Hardik Patel has emerged as an important face in the Gujarat elections
 hardik patel chunaav main congress kaa saath de sakate hai, yahi kaaran he ki bijepi patidaaron ko lekar kaaphi soch samaj kar apana kadam aage badha rahi he
 Gujarat Election: BJP released the first list, 70 names announced: In this list, there are a few candidates for both the phases
 inamen aisi siton ko laayaa gaya he jisapar koi vivaad kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 The party has declared 58 candidates for the first phase, 12 candidates for the second phase
 bijepi ne kai maujuuda vidhayakon ko tikat diya he, saath hi congress se bijepi main aae kai netaaon ko bhi tikat diya gaya he
 In its first list, BJP has given tickets to Raghav Patel, Ramji Parmar, Mansi Chauhan, CK Rauji from BJP to Congress
 gauratlab he ki gujarat main pehle charan ke 19 jilon kii 89 siton ke namakan kii antim taarikh 21 november he
 So BJP has time to announce the names of its candidates right now
 vahiin duusare charan ke 93 siton ke namakan kii antim taarikh 27 november he
 Gujarat: 12 out of 70 Patidars in bjp's first list, Congress leaders also got a chance sansad kaa monsoon satr shuru hote hi vipaksh kaa sarkaar par hamalaa karnaa bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Mayawati spoke the first major attack of this session
 rajyasabha main unhone sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa, to vahiin puri baat naa kiye jane par upasabhapati se bhi vah naaraaz huin
 Mayawati walked out of the Rajya Sabha angered and asked to resign
 bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo or uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri mayawati kaa rajyasabha main kaarykaal april 2018 main khatm ho rahaa he
 The party does not have enough figures in the state assembly to reach the Rajya Sabha once again in 2018
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke 2007 ke chunaav main bahujan samaaj party ko purna bahumat mil or party kaa vot share bhi 30 fisadi se adhik rahaa
 This figure was important for Mayawati in the state's politics because apart from her Dalit vote bank in the state, she got votes from forward castes and she came to power as the most powerful Chief Minister of the state
 ise bhi padhe: pehali baar donon taraf se dalit ummidavaar hona, baba sahib or BSP kii dein: mayawatiek dashak bitta he or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ne mayawati ke liye ankaganit ko puri tarah se ulat diya
 His party won just 19 seats out of 403 seats in the state assembly
 seat ko chhodkar sendhamari unke vot bank main lagi or dalit bahul siton main se 84 fisadi siten bijepi ke khate main gayi
 At the same time, BJP also got 41 percent vote of Dalit vote bank
 bas ab ek hi rasta!vahiin 2018 main ek baar phir rajyasabha jane ke liye unhen unke paas mahaj ek vikalp bachataa he ki vah samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan kar len
 According to the data, the two parties together can send two members to the Rajya Sabha
 lekin kya bihar main argedy or jediu kii tarj par mayawati apane virdohi samaajawaadee party ke saath yah samjhauta karne ke liye taiyaar hongi
 Significantly, if Mayawati takes this step to reach the Rajya Sabha in any case, then what effect this may have on the general election to be held in 2019 after one year, Mayawati will have to assess
 ek dashak main badale in aankadon ne ab mayawati ke saamne apana raajnneetik astitv bachaane kii chunauti khadi kar di he
 While he has to ensure a seat in the Rajya Sabha once again for himself in 2018, his party is not empowered to send him to Parliament this time
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa daawa he ki yadi mayawati kaa rajyasabha kaarykaal puraa hote hi unhen dobaaraa rajyasabha main jagah nahin mili to unke liye raajnneeti main apana astitv bachaana itnaa aasaan nahin rahegaa
 Dalit President Baba Saheb owes it that voting has been done to elect a new President in the country
 desh kii sansad samet sabhi vidhansabha main yah voting karai ja chuki he
 The contest is between NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind and opposition candidate Meera Kumar
 voting shuru hote hi basapa supremeo mayawati ne ek bada bayaan diya ki yah pehali baar he ki satta or vipaksh donon kii ore se dalit ummidavaar maidan main utaara gaya he
 Mayawati believes that anyone can win or lose but the big thing for them is that the next President of the country will be the Dalit
 haalanki is bayaan ke saath mayawati ne yah koshish bhi kii ki iskaa puraa shrey vah baba sahib ambedkar or kanshiram ko den jisase bahujan samaaj party ke liye raajnneeti main apni saakh bachaana aasaan ho
 But, this statement also includes the compulsion of Mayawati that when both BJP and Congress have presented the Dalit candidate as President in the country, they do not have enough data to ensure a seat in Rajya Sabha for themselves

 Actually, here Ruby and Tahir got married a year ago against the wishes of the family

 It is worth mentioning that recently in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, Abdul Hakim was killed by the accused in a similar incident

 rajeev gandhi parivaar or sanjay gandhi parivaar
 The political war between the two is old
 inke aapasi mail-jol kii tasviren bhi rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad bamushkil hi najar aati hai
 But on Thursday, on a special occasion, the prince Rahul and Varun of the two families met and saw something like that
 darasal, sansad bhawan ke anexi main yun to sansad kistanding cametiki tamaam baithken hoti hai, lekin anexi hui sansad kii videsh mantralay kii standig cameti kii is saal kii 13veen or antim baithak kaa najaara kuch aisa tha ki cameti ke sadasyon kii ankhe bhi chaundhiya gayi
 In the same hall, this meeting was going on under the chairmanship of Shashi Tharoor at the round table
 baithak menvarun gandhi, karn singh, supriya sule, sharad treepathi, pawan verma sareekhe saansad maujuud the
 The topic of discussion outside was that this is the last meeting of the year and for the first time Varun Gandhi is attending, then shortly after Rahul Gandhi, another member of the Entry Lee Committee
 tahakikat karne par maaloom hua ki rahul bhi varun kii tarah saal bhar main pehali baar aae hai
 While sitting on the conversation between Rahul and Varun, Rahul said hello to Varun along with the rest of the members, Varun also responded warmly by saying hi while sitting in the chair
 baaki sadsy is najaare ko gaur se dekh rahe the
 On many occasions in the middle of the meeting, between Rahul and Varun, yes, yes, exactly as the dialogue happened
 par tab khaas najaara saamne aayaa jab demand for grant par ho rahi is baithak main rahul ne mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke liye suzav diya ki enarai se shaadi ke baad pareshaani main padane vaali mahilaon kii medical or legal madad ke liye videsh mantralay kaa fund kaaphi kam he, isko jaldi badhaayaa janaa chahie
 Before anyone would say anything on this, Varun supported Rahul and said, 'it is absolutely right, i also agree
 aisa kiya janaa chahie
 This is a very good suggestion
 'rahul baad main aae or pehle nikaledhai ghante chali baithak main rahul kareeb dedh ghante ruke or uske baad adhyaksh shashi tharur ko jaruri kaam kaa hawala dete hue jaldi jane kii anumati ek parchi main likhakar maangi or ravaanaa ho gaye

 lekin aapasi baatcheet main baithak se nikle saansadon ke bich do gandhiyon kii mulaakaat charchaa kaa vishay rahi
 The families of both of them owe it to the old couple of years, who would have forgotten when Maneka Gandhi contested against Rajiv Gandhi after Indira Gandhi's assassination as her Lok Sabha constituency

 The master plan to strengthen the organization was discussed in a meeting chaired by Sonia Gandhi on Thursday
 isko lekar training incharge sachin raav dwaara banaaya gaya chaar panne kaa note jari kiya gaya
 It is the view of the party leaders that to spread the message to the public about the ideology of Congress, its opinion on issues, workers need to be associated with the organization and training them
 bhagava brigade kii vishaal chunavi mashinari kaa saamana karne ke liye ab desh kii sabase puraani party sangh ke prachaarkon kii kaat dhundne main lagi he
 The party will raise its cadre on the ground through membership drive and training drive
 party kaa maananaa he janata kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye netaaon ko jamini ladaai ladane kii jarurat he
 Senior people of the party will be 'motivators', for this a group of workers will be formed, who will be called 'motivators'
 isko ittefaq kahie yaa sangh ko lekar congress kii uljhan par 'prerak' shabd sangh ke prachaarak se bilkul miltaa-julata he
 It will be senior people associated with the 'motivational' organization, who will have a good knowledge about the Congress ideology and the party
 'prerak' ke jariye congress party apane jamini kaaryakartaaon tak pahonchegi or unako regular training degi
 These are the people of the Motivational Party who will gain the confidence of the activists
 vah sammanit netaaon main se chune jaaenge or pradesh congress kamity ke antargat hi kaam karenge
 If the word 'co-ordinator' and 'associate' are considered by the churches, some leaders expressed concern about the word 'motivator' in the meeting and it was decided with the consent of everyone that the word 'motivator' was changed to 'co-ordinator' or 'associate'
 Will be done
 sutron kaa kahana tha ki sabase pehle mukul vaasanic ne kaha ki 'prerak' shabd kii jagah duusare shabd kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Whatever the word, the reality is that it will not be easy to beat the BJP in the same game, even when the Sangh's huge machinery is connected with the BJP

 This is true for the Kejriwal family from March 2014 to February 10, 2015, which can deter anyone thinking of making politics clean
 yah sab kejariwal ne isi daur main bhoga
 These conditions were not there at all from the Anna agitation of 2011 till 14 February 2014, when Kejriwal resigned on the issue of Jan Lokpal and sacrificed his government in Delhi

 Within a year of joining politics (forming the Aam Aadmi Party) after the Anna movement, his whole family had a happy feeling of Arvind becoming the CM of Delhi

 First, to picket and then to leave the cm's chair on the question of Lokpal, ie the rapid struggle which brought power, the situation was created by abandoning power at the same speed

 In a country where sticking to a chair is considered a sign of being strong, Kejriwal left the cm's chair for public issues and committed a crime! In protest against the inaction of the police in rape cases, they staged a crime! It took years to realize this as the Kejriwal family lived, be it a tragedy or a lesson in politics
 begharon ko ghar dilaane kii 49 dinon kii sarkaar ke mukhiya ko hi dilli main koi kiraye par ghar dene ko taiyaar nahin hua

 Kejriwal appeared to be active for the Delhi elections but the family was involved in a silent struggle
 so, nateezon ke din 10 farvari ko jab kejariwal ne haath main mike tham kar sadak par jeet main khoe kaaryakartaaon se kaha, ''yah meri patni sunita he'' to jatke main dard or traasadee kaa baandh tut gaya, jo baras bhar se samooche parivaar kaa imtahaan le rahaa tha

 php Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh met Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday evening amid speculation of his resignation following the terror attacks in Mumbai
 haalanki is baithak main unke istife kaa mudda nahin uthaa or is par faisla sonia gandhi karengi
 After the meeting, Deshmukh said that he has informed Sonia Gandhi about everything
 deshmukh ke anusaar sonia gandhi baad main unhen apane nirnay se avgat karaayengi
 During Deshmukh's meeting with Sonia, besides Sonia's political secretary Ahmed Patel, Defense Minister and party in-charge of Maharashtra Affairs AK Antony and Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee were also present
 deshmukh par istife ke liye dabaav us samay bad gaya jab rajya ke upmukhyamantri or ensipi netaa aaraar patil ne istipha de diya
 The most controversial statement made in the Lok Sabha by Nirmala Sitharaman was on the issue of onions
 The last day of the winter session of Parliament got disturbed
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saansadon ne congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke 'rape in india' bayaan par sansad ke donon sadanon main jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 Although Rahul made this statement outside the House at an election rally, but its echo was also heard in the House
 rahul ne bhi saaf kar diya ki wo maafee nahin maangenge
 The Congress mp's statement was outside the House, but inside Parliament, some mps from the ruling and opposition made such statements which were discussed from the street to the Parliament
 sadhvi ne godse ko bataaya deshbhaktasatr kaa pehla vivaadit bayaan bijepi saansad sadhvi pragna kaa rahaa
 He called Nathuram Godse a patriot in the Lok Sabha, which was fiercely debated
 haalanki baad main unhone maafee maang lee thi
 The SPG Amendment Bill was being discussed in the Lok Sabha
 charchaa ke dauraan diemke ke saansad e raja godse ke ek bayaan kaa hawala de rahe the ki usne mahatma gandhi ko kyon maaraa
 Sadhvi Pragya interrupted as soon as a Raja said this
 sadhvi pragna ne godse ko deshbhakt bataate hue kaha, 'aap ek deshbhakt kaa udhaaharan nahin de sakate
 However, Pragya Singh Thakur's statement was removed from the Lok Sabha records
 adheer ranjan ne nirmala ko nirbala sitaraman batayacongress sansadeey dal ke netidhir ranjan choudharyloksabhaa main sarkaar par hamlawar to rahete hai, lekin aakraamakata main vah kai baar vivaadit bayaan de dete hai
 He made an objectionable statement on Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the lower house
 adheer ranjan nenirmala sitaramanako nirbala sitaraman bataaya
 After this statement, BJP got a chance to attack Congress
 party ne ise mudda banaaya
 Adhir Ranjan apologized after the bjp's attacking stance
 nirmala sitaraman par unke bayaan par abhi vivaad thama hi nahin tha ki adheer ranjan ne ek or vivaadit tippanee kar di
 He targeted the Modi government on the pretext of Make in India but he got himself caught in it
 unhone kaha ki bharat rape in india banataa ja rahaa he
 The BJP created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha even today about his statement
 'lahasun-pyaaj nahin khaati'ye to baat hui sadhvi pragna or adheer ranjan choudhary kii
 The government ministers also did not shy away from the controversial statement
 loksabhaa main pyaaj kii keemton par charchaa ke dauraan vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aisa bayaan diya jisaki kisi ko ummid nahin thi
 Nirmala Sitharaman said in a reply to the Congress mp's question, "I do not eat so much garbage, onion, sir
" main aise parivaar se aati hum jahaan anian se matlab nahin rakhte
 'his statement became very viral on social media
 virendra singh mast kaa bayanvirendra singh mast ne auto sector main mandi ko lekar ek ajeebogareeb bayaan diya
 He said in the Lok Sabha that in order to bring the country into disrepute, talk of slowdown in auto sector and reduced sales are being done
 unhone sawaal kiya ki agar auto kshetra main mandi he tab ek ek ghar main kai gaadiyaan or sadak par jam kyon he?nishikant dube kaa jidipi par bayaansatr main jidipi kaa mudda uthaa
 BJP MP from Godda Nishikant Dubey gave such a statement on GDP, on which he was fiercely drawn
 loksabhaa main nishikant dube ne kaha ki jidipi 1934 main ai, isse pehle koi jidipi nahin thi, sirf jidipi ko bible, ramayana yaa mahabharat maan lenaa satya nahin he or bhavishya main jidipi kaa bahut zyada upyog nahin hoga
 More important than GDP is the permanent economic welfare of the common man, which is happening
 aprijal ke baad ab wo vakt aane vaala he, jab aapaki selary bhi badhegi or aapako pramotion bhi milegaa
 Many employees change their behavior after getting promoted and they lose focus on their work
 pramotion milane k baad karmchaaree thode laaparvaah ho jate hai or kuch galtiyaan kar dete hai
 Let us know which mistakes should be avoided after getting promotion
 team ko na karen awoidaye baat yaad rakhen ki jo pramotion mila he usamen aapaki team kaa bhi yogadan he
 Without teamwork, your success is not possible
 isliye kaam ke dauraan team ko awoid karne kii koshish naa karen
 Also do not exaggerate yourself
 freshars se intervyuu main puche jate hai ye sawaal, aise den jawaab
 
 
 Don't become careless Often people get a little careless after getting promoted
 unhen lagata he ki ab to pramotion ho gaya, agar parformens thodi kam bhi hogi to zyada fark nahin padegaa
 But remember one thing, with getting promotion, your responsibilities and target also increase
 isliye offis kaa kaam pehle se bhi zyada gambhir rup se len
 If you do not do this, you will never reach your goal
 overconfident naa rahenye baat naa bhoolen ki pramotion aapke achche kaam ke liye mila he
 Do not become overconfident after promotion
 offis ke har kaam main apana haath naa daalen
 Give the work assigned to you at the right time
 pramotion ke baad bos ko ye jataane kii koshish naa karen ki aap har kaam kar sakate hai
 One mistake in an affair of an overconfident can cause you heavy damage
 ye 7 chijen offis main behatar kaam karne main karengi helpana karen khud par ghamankepani uplabdhiyon par garv karnaa acchhee baat he, lekin ise apane sar par chadh jane dena aapke liye hi nuksaandaayak hota he
 Therefore, do not let your success climb on you by forgetting it
 apane karmchaariyon ke bich baithkar apane munh miyaan mitthu naa bane
 Do not consider anyone's work as small, it is often seen that after getting promotion, people consider their juniors' work as small
 kaam ke dauraan bhala- bura bhi bol dete hai
 But you should not forget that you started the work with a small post

 The judges were also very impressed with his performance

 Recently, Faizal Khan also wrote an emotional note posting his picture from the hospital
 unhone likhaa tha, "kabhi-kabhi, bhagya aapaki ichchhaaon ke khilaaf kaam karata he or durbhaagya se aap ise control nahin kar sakate
 Nach Baliye was my return to the stage, performing brilliantly on stage, dancing and all that i love
 or is baar bachche ke taur par nahin balki ek vayask ke rup main!" Groupism or Individualism? Which factor can be more effective in maintaining any political party for a long time? Aam Aadmi Party was born from an issue
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolanase jude logon ke samooh ne yah raajnneetik forum banaaya
 Arvind Kejriwal remained the key-factor of this politics of groupism, with whom some faces like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan also appeared on the screen
 lekin dilli chunaavon main mili kamyaabi kaa said effect kahen yaa kuch or ki party dhire-dhire vyaktvaad kii ore kendrit hone lagi he
 If we see, those parties are more permanent in the country, on which familyism or any other reason has emerged
 varanaa isse itar jitne main prayog hue hai unamem zyaadaatar jaldi hi bikhar kar barbaad ho gaye
 It seems as if we have not been able to get much ahead from the governance of the royal family
 sirf sonia-rahul or koi nahincongress main kai aise netaa hai jinaki apni haisiyat or janaadhar he, lekin ve netritv ke samanaantar shaayad hi kabhi khadey hote najar aaen hon
 After the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the Congress also had to go through a crisis
 party tuuti bhi, lekin jab sonia ne kaman sanbhali to satta kii bhagidaari ke liye sab saath ho liye
 Now after Sonia, it is only Rahul's - or else there are some slogans about Priyanka
 bas or kuch nahin
 There is no one else there
 phir jhagada kis baat ke liye
 Mayawati Kanshi Ram formed Bahujan Samaj Party when BSP said
 wo mayawati ko le aae or kaman saunp di
 Now BSP means Mayawati - no one else
 sapa yani mulaayam yaa phir akhilesh yadavauttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet kar akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri bane
 There may be a period of resentment and respect for supremacy in the party, but there is rarely a question about leadership
 vaise loksabhaa chunaav main sirf ve hi jite jo parivaar ke sadsy the - baaki party saaf ho gai - isliye sawaal uthaane vaala koi bachaa bhi nahin
 Apart from lalu-rabri's lalu-rabri party, in times of crisis, Misa Bharti and sometimes Tejashwi Yadav manage the front, the rest are activists with full faith in leadership
 aisa nahin hota ki vidhayakon kaa gut alag party banane kii koshish na karata ho, lekin lalu kaa vyaktvaad sari koshishon par baari padataa he
 What could be the condition of interfering excessively, Sadhu Yadav, who is a close friend of Lalu, is an example of this
 thakare, thakare or thakrebal thakare ke baad uddhav thakare netritv sambhaal rahe hai
 Aditya Thackeray will replace him next

 Behind the BJP is also the Sangh Parivar, which is tied to ideology
 lok sabha chunaav se pehle bijepi main bhi khub shor shoraba hua lekin sab shant bhi ho gaya
 Talking about ideology, the Left parties - CPI and CPM are also in the fray
 oktober 1988 main veepi singh ke prayaas se lok dal, congress es, janamorcha or janata party ke ek dhade ko milakar janata dal bana, lekin zyada din nahin chal sakaa
 In Indian politics, there have often been experiments in the shadow of groupism, in which leaders of small parties and dissidents of big parties form a group and then as soon as the ambitions start booming, all of them fall apart
 saidhantik rup se bhale hi ise khaarij kar diya jaae, lekin bhartiya raajnneeti kii sabase badi hakeekat yahi he ki samoohwaad ke mukaable vyaktvaad jisaki jad main parivaarwaad ho zyada prabhavi rahaa he
 In the opinion of AAP leader Ashutosh, the ruckus in the party started due to the conflict of views in which the leftist thinking of politics on one side and the thinking of practical practical politics on the other side 
 ab ye sirf vichaaron kaa takaraav he yaa varchasv kii ladaai he? yaa kejariwal ke neeche ek nayaa samooh ban gaya he jo party par haaavee he? agar naye samooh main mahatvakankshaayen jagin, phir 'aap' kaa kya hoga? aap bachegi yaa tuutakar bikhar jaaegi

 After Sachin Tendulkar's 99th international century, Dale Steyn's havoc bowling and fireworks display of tail-end batsmen in the last over, South Africa beat India by three wickets in a Group b thrilling league match to enter the quarter-finals of the World Cup Chance prevailed
 dakshin africa ko aakhri over main 13 ran kii jarurat thi
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni handed the ball to Ashish Nehra, whose first ball was hit by Robin Peterson for a four and the second ball was hit for six

 On the ordinance protecting the tainted leaders, Rahul Gandhi on Friday blew up a revolt against his government that so far the Congress and ministers of the Manmohan cabinet were also turning one by one

 Came to the media and said that after returning to the country, i will discuss it in the cabinet
 unhone kaha ki is sambandh main rahul ne mujhe chitthee likhi thi
 At the same time, sources in the government have told that now this ordinance will be withdrawn
 kyonki rahul gandhi ke saarvajanik virodh ke baad sarkaar ke paas or koi vikalp nahin bachataa
 Ordinance is nonsense, tear and throw away: Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was shocked by giving a different opinion from the party on the government ordinance to contest the elections of Rahul Gandhi
 adhyadesh ke liye behad kade shabdon kaa istemaal karte hue rahul ne kaha, 'adhyadesh par meri raay he ki yah saraasar bakawaas he or ise fadkar phenk dena chahie

 He is our leader, so his opinion is the opinion of Congress

 '' Union ministers also changed, till now, many of Manmohan's ministers, who were defending the ordinance in front of the media, started taunting Rahul Gandhi after his statement

 I'm happy

 But now i am saying
 rahul gandhi sahi hai
 After this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Shukla even said that Rahul Gandhi's statements are correct
 unka bayaan hi party kii raay he
 Now the question arises that if Rahul Gandhi did not agree with this decision of his government then why wait for three days? That too when it is discussed in the Congress Core Group meeting before any decision is approved in the cabinet
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki congress kor group kii baithak main rahul gandhi bhi maujuud rahete hai

 Now time has once again brought Sudha on the road

 Even when the floods reached the courtyard, no one thought that their house was going to be destroyed

 "manmohan Singh Rawat of Thatti village says," On the day of the disaster, DM, SDM, Tehsildar and 108 emergency services were called, but nobody came for 8 days
 thati-budhakedaar gram panchayat ke rafal, dadoli, dunala or ghanaali taakon main bahut nuksaan hua he
 People's fields, filters, houses are all washed away

 But as soon as the house had a roof, nature did its work
 ab natthilal ke paas na khet bache or na unka ashiana hi ban paaya
 Natthilal says, "I have nothing left now
" saare khet bechakar makaan bana rahaa tha
 Now he is also not left
 main pehle bhi duusare ke makaan main rahata tha
 Now maybe there will never be a house

 chhattisgarh rajya police academy kii train mahila police afasaron ne ek senior adhikari par badasluki ke gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Trainee women officers allege that their trainer ASP Mirza Jiyarat Baig is abusing them indecently and that they are paraded late night wearing nightwear
 haalanki anushaasan kaa hawala dete hue kisi shikayatakarta mahila train afasar yaa aaropee adhikari jiyaarat beg ne camere par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 According to the complaint letter sent to Raipur SP, about a dozen women trainee police officers have sent a complaint letter to SP of Raipur in this regard
 mahila train police afasaron kii shikaayat he ki jiyaarat beg unke saamne hi abhadra vyavhaar or ashleel bhashaa kaa prayog karte hai
 They also allege that they are suddenly picked up late at night and paraded in front of male police officers in their night clothes
 is baat kii di ja rahi he sajounhone yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki raat main unke kamare kaa darwaja khulwaane ke liye adhikari ustad va major ko bhej dete hai
 The complainant women officers say that in the past, the former SP of Police Academy and the current SP of Surguja, Sadanand Kumar met the trainee officers
 mahaj itani si baat se naaraaz hokar jiyaarat beg ne sabhi train dspi ko vardi sahit dedh kilometre kii parade lagavai thi

 When sick, they are not given proper treatment

 dhamkee dete hue aaropee afasar unhen dandit karne, rojnaama main entry na karne dene or sarvice book kharaab karne kii baat kehete hai
 The accused officer denied the allegations, ASP Jiyarat Begne refused to say anything on camera on the allegations made by the women trainee officers
 haalanki unhone apane upar lage aaropon ko bebuniyaad jarur bataaya
 The surprising thing in this whole case is that despite receiving complaints from women trainee officers, the DIG of Police Academy did not consider the need for immediate action and went on leave
 ajtak ne jab police academy ke DIG ares nayak se sampark kiya to unhone kaha ki abhi vah chuttee par hai or chuttee par jane se pehle unhen shikaayat mil gai thi

 vah ajeebogareeb lamhaa vijendra shekhavat ko puure byore ke saath ab bhi yaad he-''main or mahima mehara, jo ab meri bijness partner hai, pehali dfa saath-saath amer ke kile main gaye
 Suddenly he caught and pulled back
 asal main saamne hathi ke gobar kaa ooncha dher padaa tha
 "elephants abound in this fort adjacent to Jaipur and built by Raja Man Singh in 1596 and its ride is one of the major attractions here
" aise main yahaan jagah-jagah haathiyon kii lid kaa dher najar aana koi hairat kii baat nahin
 He avoided getting his feet on this stinking heap, but Shekhawat, who ran a small business of handmade paper, saw a good possibility of a business in it
 unhone sochaa ki kyon na ise kaagaj banane ke liye kachche maal kii tarah istemaal kiya jaae
 Those acquaintances and experts in front of whom Vijender expressed such opinion, called it insanity
 lekin is bare main jo baat shekhavat ko pataa thi, vah duusare log shaayad nahin jaanate theah yahi ki hathi kii lid main fibre yani reshon kii maatra bahut zyada hoti he
 He explains, "the elephant's digestive system cannot digest fibers very well
 is tarah se uski lid main kaagaj banane ke liye jaruri pulp taiyaar karne kii khaasi gunjaaish hoti he
 An elephant is an animal that can digest only 40% of its consumption
 '' usee kii lid ko ab ricikal kar shekhavat or mehara jo hathi chhap brands kaa kaagaj bana rahe hai, use desh bhar main 40 dukaanon se bechaa jaataa he or niryaat bhi kiya jaataa he
 In 2011-12, he got a total of Rs 35 lakh from it
 kii aamad hui
 They also make elephant print cards, notebooks, bags, photo albums and many other decorative items
 aaj har metro shahar main is brands kii dukaane hai or sabase zyada maang mumbai, bangaloru or chennai se aati he
 The company started in 2004
 lekin hathi kii sawari itani aasaan bhi na thi
 Vijendra says, "apart from glory, everyone ridiculed me
" meri maa to ghar main lid ko laae jane ke bare main sochakar hi fat padin
 He said that because of this profession, no girl would be willing to marry me
 ''hathi kii lid ikattha karnaa mushkil kaam he
 Very few workers are willing to dirty their hands for this
 iske baad ise disinfvct yani rogaanu mukt kiya jaataa he or yah andaja lagane ke liye prayog kiye jate hai ki isse kaagaj banane ke liye jaruri gunvattta vaala pulp taiyaar hoga yaa nahin
 Shekhawat did experiments for months before using the correct method for making paper
 unki raay suniye, ''aisa nahin ki hathi lid se mujhe koi khaas lagaav tha
 i did experiments with other things as well
 kavle ke tanon ke reshedaar hisson kaa istemaal kiya
 Tried silk threads to make decorative paper
 lekin inamen se kuch bhi kargar nahin hua
 But the use of elephant droppings was effective
 ''vijendra ne haathiyon se dharmik judaav nikaalkar apane parivaar ko bhi manaa liya
 What did you say, listen: "I told him that the head of the first worshiped deity in Hinduism, Ganesh, is the head of an elephant, so how can the elephant's dung be considered impure
 maine unhen bataaya ki brahmanon kaa ek varg aisa he jo hathi kii lid ko pavitra maanata he
 "today all those difficulties have been left behind
 unki patni (ji haa, unhen yogya jeevanasathi milane main koi dikkat nahin hui) unke is kaam main sakriyata se judi hai
 His brothers also help in this work
 yah ab bhi ek kutir udyog he, jisamen shekhavat ne lid ko garm karne, saaf karne or uski chantai karne ke liye sirf teen logon ko naukari par rakhaa he
 He does the rest with his wife and brother
 vijendra har subah khud bhi lid ko ikattha karne nikalate hai
 They themselves supply green fodder to elephant owners to improve its quality
 har 1,000 kilo lid se kareeb 150 kilo pulp taiyaar hota he
 "my past experience in the handmade paper industry has helped establish the Elephant Imprint brand," says Mehra, a Shekhawat partner who handles much of the distribution for the company
 '' ve bataati hai ki shuruaati kuchhek saalon main brands ko jamaane main mushkil ai, lekin 2007-08 ke baad aamadani main asaadhaaran ijapha hua
 In his own words, "until around 2010, there was hardly any company other than us that mass-produced handmade paper, so its market was very small
 saamaajik-aarthik dashaon main sudhaar or is kshetra main kai nae khilaadiyon ke utarane se maang badhaane main madad mili
 However, neither Shekhawat nor Mehra are keen to give the project a bigger face
 mehara kahati hai, ''bade retailor jis tarah kii maang karte hai uski vajah se ham unke paas janaa pasand nahin karte
 Sometimes our supply is delayed, especially during the rainy season when the pulp takes a long time to dry
 ham jin vyapaariyon ko supplai karte hai unhen isse koi dikkat nahin hoti
 "vijendra also agrees," i think the nature of mutual support of our business is what makes it sustainable

 Here are excerpts from her conversation: Your film has been released and within four days she joined the club of 100 crores
 kya ab aap tanavamukt ho gaye hai?main chaar dinon se soya nahin hum
 This often happens at the time of release, but tonight i will sleep like a superhero
 yah kaaphi badhiya he ki film chaar dinon ke andar hi 100 karod ke club main aa gai
 Not only this, the film made 35 on Monday
 91 karod rupee kii kamai karke ek din main sabase zyada kamai kaa nayaa record bhi banaaya he
 This is a feeling that i cannot express in words
 ek film par teen saalon tak mehnat karne ke baad relies ke din kaisaa lagata he?shuukravaar ko to subah hui hi nahin kyonki guuruuvaar ko ham soe hi the
 It is not just my hard work, but the whole team worked on a project for two to three years
 isliye aap chaahate hai ki team main shaamil sabhi logon ke liye film acha kaam kare
 My father took a brave step by making Krish 3 so i want the film to do a good job for him and others
 vah koun si shuruaati baaten thim, jinhone aapako bataaya ki aapaki film chal nikali he?main shuruaati baton main yakeen nahin rakhata
 In the beginning there will be many people who will tell you that your film is very good, but it is better to wait in the first few days and then you get to know about the response yourself
 shuruaati baton se film par nishkarsh nikaalane kii jarurat nahin he

 aapane mumbai main audiyans ke saath baithkar film dekhi
 It sounds good, but wasn't it dangerous? It is a learning experience for any artist
 jab main un logon ke saath film dekh rahaa tha to main baar-baar ye soch rahaa tha ki hamen is seen main kuch or bhi daalana chahie tha kyonki ve yahaan par hans rahe hai, hamen thode or ection kaa istemaal karnaa chahie tha kyonki darshak anand uthaa rahe hai
 i have decided that now i will see all my films sitting in the audience
 aapaki film ne 35
 It has also created a new record of highest earning in one day by earning Rs 91 crore
 aap jaise star ke liye is tarah ke record kitne myne rakhte hai? kya isse kuch badal jaataa he?yah ek game he or main ise khilne ke liye taiyaar hum
 We are all here for a cause and i want to be involved in the whole process from acting to celebrating the success of the film
 ye records khud par or apane kaam par phir se vishwaas dilaate hai
 What do you learn from what is written about your films? Good or bad! If someone writes something about my work, it is their own idea, it is not the idea of the public, but of a person

 But i want to tell the audience that Krrish 4 will be released before you know it

 Rani Mukherjee is not an identity in Bollywood
 filmi becoground se aane vaali rani apni kutanes or acting skills kii vajah se jaani jaati hai
 Rani has been away from film industry since the birth of daughter Adira
 india today ke program main rani ne bataaya ki wo duusare baby kii planning kar rahi hai
 Rani Mukherjee is making a comeback in Bollywood with the film 'hichki'
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki kya wo kabhi apane pati aditya se unhen kisi film ke liye cast karne ko nahin kahatee, rani kaa jawaab tha - nahin
 Rani said, Whenever i talk to Aditya, i talk about the planning of another child, not for any film
 rani ne kaha ki adira ke baad ab unhen duusare bachche kii chaah he
 PHOTOS Finally, Rani was spotted at the airport in a very cool look when she arrived to meet sister Rani Mukherjee
 filmon se dur rani kaa ye andaaj kaaphi glamras tha
 The Queen carried a leather jacket with a black T-shirt, blue jeans, sporty sneakers and a Louis Vuitton bag
 rani kaa ye andaaj unhen sach main bollywood deeva banaata he
 By the way, let us tell you that you will be surprised to know the price of Rani Jacket
 rani kii jacket kii keemat 1 lakh 30 hajaar rupee he jise unhone british fishan brand belstaff se kharida he
 Rani Mukherjee speaks on Padmavati- Be in love, do not spread hatred
 Let us know that Rani Mukherjee, who appeared in India Today Conclave, spoke openly about nepotism, Padmavati controversy and her film career
 padmavati vivaad par rani mukherjee ne kaha, hamen samaaj main pyaar se rahanaa chahie
 Humanity should speak the language of love and should not do anything that spreads hatred in the society

 The intoxication of wealth, fame and success speaks to the head of a human being many times, but in the country's largest state of Uttar Pradesh, these three addicts dominate every other leader and leader of the ruling party of the state
 thane main balaatkaar kii koshish ke baad koi aurat jinda jala di jaati he, to kahin koi vidhayak kisi garib bevaa kaa ghar hi ujaad detaa he or kahin jabaran vasuuli ke liye vidhayak kii dhamkiyon se gram pradhan kii jaan ke laale pad jate hai

 peedit mahila kii maane to donon vidhayakon ke gurgon ne mangalvaar achaanak uskaa ghar chaaron taraf se gher liya
 Before she could understand anything, first pulled her out of the house and then mutilated her house in front of her eyes with a bulldozer
 vah cheekhti rahi, chillaati rahi or raham kii bheekh maangati rahi, lekinkanoonabanane vaale vidhayak khud hi ek garib vidhwaa ko beghar karte rahe
 a single roof has also been snatched away from a single woman living in a place for 40 years on the strength of her husband
 kaaphi bhagdaud ke baad police nemahilaaki shikaayat par report to darj kar lee, lekin iske baad use jo dhamkee mili, wo rongte khadey karne vaali thi
 The mla's operatives said that if he did not withdraw his police complaint, he would be burnt alive next time
 jahaan kanoon banane waalon se lekarkanoonki hifaazat karne waalon tak saare ke saare satta ke chashme se duniya dekhte hon, vahaan bhala insaaf kii ummid bhi kisase kii ja sakati he

 france se 36 rafel ladaaku jet vimaanon kii kharid ko lekar vartmaan bharat-france vaarta ofaset provijan or hathiyaar praudyogiki main badlaav ko lekar mushkil main funs gai he
 Defense sources said a major obstacle is the offset provision that India is putting pressure on, but France says that this will increase the price of the aircraft
 ofaset niti raksha kharid prakriya, 2005 ke tahat pehali baar laai gai thi, jiske antargat videshi company ko apane qaraar kaa ek hissaa bharat main nivesh karnaa hoga
 The second issue is that the Air Force is demanding some special changes to Rafale, so that certain weapons can be put into it, while France has offered other changes
 isse bhi keemat bad jaaegi
 The comments sutron ne kaha, 'jab se misr or katar ke saath qaraar hue hai tab se hi daam ke liye pehle se nirdhaarit maapdand hai
 The aircraft for India cannot be cheaper than the price at which the other two countries have bought the aircraft

 The offset policy was first introduced under the Defense Procurement Procedure, 2005, under which a foreign company would have to invest a part of its agreement in India
 doosraa mudda yah he ki vayusena rafel main kuch vishesh prakaar kii tabdili kii maang kar rahi he, taaki kuch khaas hathiyaar usamen lagaae ja saken, jabaki france ne duusare tarah kii badlaav kii peshkash kii he
 This will also increase the price
 tippaniyan Sources said, "since the agreement with Egypt and Qatar, there have been pre-determined parameters for the price
 anya do deshon ne jis daam par vimaan kharida he, bharat ke liye vimaan usase kam daam par nahin ho saktaa
 He said that there has been no dialogue between the two sides recently, which indicates a possible deadlock
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni france yatra ke dauraan vayusena kii sanchaalanaatmak jaruraton kaa hawala dete hue 36 rafel ladaaku jet kharidne ke apane faisle kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The announcement came as a nod to the Air Force's modernization plan, as the original deal to buy 126 Rafale jets through the tender process was stuck for years
 sutron ne kaha, 'jab se misr or katar ke saath qaraar hue hai tab se hi daam ke liye pehle se nirdhaarit maapdand hai

 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whether the BJP will bring one new year to explain the way of MCD, or give the old face a chance once again
