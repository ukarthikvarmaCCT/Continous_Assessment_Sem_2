 The law of Maharashtra prohibits the illegal transportation of beef (or cows, bulls and calves for cutting)
 haalanki kamjor bhaison kaa vadh kiya ja saktaa he
 The buffaloes present in the truck were declared infertile from the government mandi and from where they were purchased
 driver ke paas sarkari pashu chikitsak dwaara jari ek chikitsa praaanpatr bhi tha, jiske tahat vah pashuon ko lekar ja saktaa tha
 Nevertheless, a truck was stopped by a mob of cow guards in Saswad village, about an hour from Pune
 us bheed ne hamaare cameraman sanjay or trek driver ke saath dhakka-mukki kii
 His phone was also snatched away
 ve sabhi is dauraan gaali-galouj karte rahe
 They entered the truck's cabin and then drove the truck to the police station
 police stesan pahunchane tak unhone ek baar bhi trek main peeche kya he, yah dekhne kii jahamat bhi nahin uthaayi
 a large crowd gathered at the Saswad police station
 yahaan ke maahaul main tanaav saaf jhalak rahaa tha
 The police made little effort to control the crowd present there, but during this time he continued to act on the gestures of a young man leading this crowd of cow guards
 is yuvak ne enditivi ke saamne apni pahchaan ek sthaneey hinduvadi sanghathan 'samast hindu agaadi' ke sadsy subhash tayade ke rup main bataai
 The colleagues of Tayade said that Pandit Parasuram Modak, who runs a cowshed here, informed them about this truck
 unhone bataaya, 'pandit ji kii gupt soochna ke baad ham log raatbhar is trek kii talash main lage rahe
 ' fasebuk par ek community pej ke anusaar parasuram modak ek gaurakshak hai or unhone 40 saal tak bijepi va aresas ke ke liye kaam kiya he
 When we asked Sub Inspector AS Tapade how this mob can stop a truck and push it? He said that the guards only give information to the police
 hamane jo dekha tha vah isse bilkul ulat tha
 There was a mob law
 jab tapade par dabaav daalaa gaya to unhone kaha, agar jarurat padi to gaurakshakon par karrwai hogi
 Meanwhile a senior officer, Inspector SS Gaur arrived there and took charge in his hand
 goud maamle ko puri tarah se sunate usase pehle hi tapade ko kisi swami kaa phone aayaa
 Tapad also increased the phone inspector
 inspector goud ne swami ko bataaya ki trek main gaay-bail nahin balki bhainsen thi or aisa lagata he ki inke paas sabhi jaruri kagajaat bhi hai
 Later it was revealed that this Swami was none other than Shiva Shankar Swami
 swami ke bare main pataa chalaa ki ve pune kshetra main jaanwaron ke kai tabele chalaate hai
 There are several cases against him including attempted murder
 yahi nahin unhen kuch samay ke liye jila badar bhi kiya gaya tha
 Shortly after Swamy's call, the police registered a case under the provisions of anti-animal slaughter law and cruelty against animals
 tippaniyan Sadiq Qureshi, a member of a group providing legal aid to the drivers, appeared angry
 unhone kaha, hamaare paas chikitsa box, pani, chaara sab kuch he
 The police is working under upward pressure

 a post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan) on Nov 1, 2019 at 3:40 am PDT Saaho Box Office Collection Day 1: bahubali prabhas (prabhas) or bollywood actress shraddha kapur (shraddha Kapoor) kii most awated film 'saaho (saaho)' box offis par relies ho chuki he or relies hone ke saath hi film ne tabadatod kamai kii he
 Many speculations are being made about the 'saaho Box Office Collection'
 lekin film trade export ne isaki pehali din kii kamai ko lekar ishaara kar diya he or is baar kai record tuutane vaale hai
 According to the film trade expert Atul Mohan
 'saaho (saaho)' pehle din 70 karod (sabhi varjan) rupee tak kaa kaarobaar kar sakati he
 Apart from this, the Hindi version of the film can collect from 18 to 20 crores
 ' is tarah 'saaho' box offis par bhuuchaal laane ke liye taiyaar he
 Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor have a mixed reaction on social media about the starrer film Saaho
 jahaan kuch phens ne 'saaho' ko damdaar movie bataai he to vahiin yah movie film samikshakon kii ummiido par khara nahin utar pai he
 Even film critics have given 'saaho' only one or two stars
 iske saath hi film kii relies ke baad se hi soshal media par isse jude mims bhi ban rahe hai
 Looking at these reactions of people about 'saaho', it can be said that it has not been able to compete with Prabhas's previous film Bahubali
 'saaho' banpar bajet film he
 It costs around Rs 350 crore, so it will have to work hard at the box office
 'saaho (saaho)' ko dekhakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yah ection premiyon ke liye parfect masala he
 But for those who want a story, the film definitely brings disappointment, as the director has tried to create a grand action on a very simple story
 lekin trade export maan rahe hai ki film ke box offis collection (saaho Box Office Collection Day 1) main duusare din giravat aa sakati he

 Kya Hai Hai Kahaani - This film is the story of two brothers, Nunnu (jimmy Shergal) and Munnu (nandish Sandhu), one of whom walks the path of truth and the other chooses the path of deceit, domination and robbery
 bada bhai nunnu bachapan se hi kaaphi shararti rahata he or uskaa padhai main man nahin lagata
 But younger brother Munnu is a boy walking the right path
 film kii shuruyaat main ek samvaad he jisamen nunnu kii maa usase kahati hai ki ''bete ke sir se baap kaa saaya chale jane ke saath hi bete kaa bachapan bhi chalaa jaataa he
 This is where the story begins
 pita ke swargvaas ke baad sari jimmedaari achaanak hi nunnu ke kandhon par aa jaati he
 Since he never studied, he takes the wrong path to feed himself and his family
 isi bich kahani main ek bebas maa kaa bhav bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 She likes to remain silent despite being aware of her son's antics, because she has no other way
 nunnu galat kaamon se paisa kama rahaa hota he or uski maa use daantne kii bajaay uski hausalafajai karti he
 Nunnu moves forward on the path of evil
 magar logon kii madad bhi karata he
 He has a sense of respect and kindness towards common people
 galat kaam ke saath-saath samaaj seva bhi karata rahata he or logon kaa fevorett ban jaataa he
 At the same time, the other brother Munnu read and becomes a professor and runs a coaching institute
 munnu ke man main bade bhai ke prati aadar-satkar kaa bhav to he, magar wo unke kaam or taur-tareekon ko pasand nahin karata
 He asks his brother to leave all these jobs
 munnu ke andar kii achchhai or sach kii raah nunnu ko pighalaane main safal to ho jaati he, magar kahani main ek bahut bada twist bhi laati he
 The story after Interval is based on this twist
 isi ke saath-saath baaki kirdaar bhi sakriy hote hai or ant main film dard kii ek tis liye happy anding ke saath khatm hoti he

 Among the co-stars, the role of Baba Bhandari was once again impressed by Saurabh Shukla, Pawan Malhotra was superb in the sp's role
 iske alaava manoj paahwa, supriya pilganvkar, yashpal sharma, mukesh tiwari or raaj jutshi ne bhi apni jagah thik hai
 Shot in a small town, this film tells the story of the atrocities and black mankind spreading in the society
 film main kuch zyada nayaapan nahin he
 But there are some twists in the story that bind
 kuch badhiya samvaad hai
 This film is full of entertainment

 PM Modi wrote a blog on the birth anniversary of Ram Manohar Lohia, targeting the Congress and regional parties, he wrote that people who are today Dr
 lohia ke siddhanton se chal kar rahe hai, vahi kal deshavaasiyon ke saath bhi chal karenge
 People who are dr
 lohia ke dikhaae raste par chalane kaa daawa karte hai, vahi kyon unhen apamaanit karne main lage hai
 PM Modi wrote that Dr
 lohia ke vichaar aaj bhi hamen prerit karte hai
 He wrote a lot about modernizing agriculture and empowering farmers, according to his ideas, the NDA government is working in the interest of farmers through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Krishi Irrigation Yojana, Soil Health Card and other schemes
 lohia par likhe blog ke jariye congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue piem modi ne likhaa ki dow
 Lohia was very sad to see the prevailing caste system in society and inequality between women and men
 ‘sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kaa hamaara mantra tathaa pichley paanch saalon kaa hamaara trek record yah dikhaata he ki hamane dow
 Has achieved significant success in realizing Lohia's vision
 agar aaj ve hote to endie sarkaar ke kaaryon ko dekhakar nishchit rup se unhen garv kii anubhuti hoti
 Whenever Dr
 lohia sansad ke bheetar yaa baahar bolte the, to congress main iskaa bhay saaf najar aata tha
 At the same time, regarding other parties of the opposition, PM Modi has written that today the so-called Lohiaist parties with the Congress are desperate to form an opportunistic grand alliance
 yah vidambnaa haasyaaspad bhi he or nindaneey bhi he
 The Prime Minister wrote that Dr
 lohia vanshavaadi raajnneeti ko hameshaa loktantr ke liye ghaatak maanate the
 Today, he must have been shocked to see that for his 'followers', the interests of their families are above the national interest
 unhone likhaa ki dow
 Lohia favored equality between men and women in every sphere of life
 lekin, vot bank kii politics main aakanth dubi partiyon kaa aacharan isse alag rahaa
 That is why the so-called Lohiaist parties opposed the NDA government's attempt to end the inhuman practice of triple talaq
 in partiyon ko yah spasht karnaa chahie ki inke liye dow
 Are Lohia's ideas and ideals big or vote bank politics? pichley dinon pakistani singer or model misha shafi ne ali jafar par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 After this, other women also accused Ali
 soshal media par chalaae gaye campan # metoo ke jariye kai khulaase kiye gaye
 After rejecting these allegations of sexual exploitation, Ali has sent a legal notice to Ali and demanded compensation
 jeeyo news kii report ke anusaar, ali kaa kahana he ki yadi misha apane jhuthe aaropon ke liye maangi nahin maangati to unhen manahani ke liye 10 karod rupye (bhartiya mudra ke ansur 6 crores rupee) adaa karne honge
 The report further states that if Meisha did not delete the tweets made in Zafar's name and he did not apologize within 2 weeks, a defamation case would be filed against him
 duusari ore jab misha ke vakil ahamed pansota se is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki unke client ko jafar kii koi kanoonee soochna nahin mili he
 Forced to try 'kiss', many women accused Ali Zafar of accusing him through a tweet
 unhone likhaa tha- ek mahila, public figure or maa hone ke naate maine hameshaa apni aawaaj uthaane kii koshish kii he, jisase un logon ko protsaahan mili, jo mujhe follow karte hai, mukhya taur par wo ladkiyaan jo pakistan main apana rasta khud bananaa chaahati hai
 During my career my family and fans have given me a lot of love and support
 isse mujhe apni aawaaj uthaane kii himmat mili
 However, there are still many issues about which women are a bit difficult to talk about - especially sexual abuse
 ali jafar misha shafi ke aaropon ko jhootha bataa chuke hai
 Now his two female band members (kanja Munir and Aksha Ali) have come in support of singer Ali Zafar
 unhone jaiming seshan ke dauraan kii puri kahani kaa khulaasa kiya he, jahaan par misha ne yon utpeedan kaa daawa kiya tha
 Pakistani singer accuses Ali Zafar of sexual exploitation, Aksha Ali wrote through a post on social media - i am surprised by Meesha's allegations
 main us concert main kru kaa hissaa thi, main ali jafar ke saath tour par jaati hum
 i have seen many girls lashing out at them, but they respond to them with great respect
 ham ek sahaj vaataaran main kaam karte hai

 pichley do din se puure ilaake main khaskar nandagaanv ke 60-70 ghar vaale mahadalit tole main dar or ’na jane kya ho jaae’ kaa milajula maahaul he
 Let me tell you here that on 12 January, the head of state Nitish Kumar reached Nandgaon during his development review trip and his convoy got a lot of stone pelting
 mukhyamantri to vahaan se surakshit nikal gaye lekin ek darjan se zyada sarkari gaadiyaan kshatigrast ho gayi or kai police adhikari ghayal ho gaye
 The video that came out of this incident clearly shows that women, men and young boys are driving bricks on government vehicles passing through the front
 mukhyamantri ke kafile par hui patharbaji kii is ghatana ne nandagaanv ke shant or beficri vaale maahaul ko pulisia halchal main tabdeel kar diya he
 The question here is why this stone-pelting happened? Did the people who stoned the Chief Minister's convoy belong to this village or came from outside? Were people who were involved in this stoning incident upset or did they get caught on the pretext of committing this incident? These are some of the questions which are constantly being asked in the context of this incident
 sthaneey patrkaar vinit mishra ke mutabik yah ghatana sthaneey mahadaliton main maujuud naaraazgi or jila prashasan dwaara is naaraazgi ko kam karke aankane kii vajah se hui
 Vinit says, 'the people of Mahadalit Tola felt that they were being ignored in the development work
 wo chaahate the ki apane gaanv main aa rahe mukhyamantri se milen, unhe apni baat kahen
 Complain about the development that has not happened in your hamlet
 tole ke rahanihaar is ichha ke saath jila prashasan ke adhikariyon se bhi mili the lekin unhone inaki suni nahin
 He stood on the side of the road and the Chief Minister's convoy started coming out in front of him
 kisi vajah se kuch mahilaon ke saath dhakka-mukki hui or phir ekaek se pattharav shuru ho gaya
 However, according to the head of Nandgaon, Rajiv Pathak, there was substantial development in the hamlet of the Mahalits
 jab hamane rajeev se patharbaji hone kaa kaaran poocha to wo bole, ' ham bhi to yahi soch rahe hai
 The women who are seen stepping stones in the video were working with us in NREGA till one day back
 hamen bilkul bhanak tak nahin thi ki us basti ke log naaraaz hai or itani badi ghatana ho jaaegi
 During the conversation, Rajiv is asked many times if all was normal
 kisi basti yaa kisi samooh main koi asantosh nahin tha to yah ghatana kaise or kyon hui hui ? lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab unke paas nahin he
 In response, he is heard saying the same thing again and again, in different ways - the development has happened everywhere
 kisi basti, kisi mohalle ko choda nahin gaya he
 At the same time, Rajiv Singh, a social worker living in Dumraon and a better understanding of the area, believes that this incident was the result of the local administration's neglect of Dalits in the development and development work
 rajiv singh us ghatana ke bare main vistaar se bataate hai
 He says, 'look
 
 
 us gaanv ke do ward 06-07 main mukhyamantri kii yojana ke mutabik vikaas hua he
 The Chief Minister reached there to see the same work
 is ward ke bagal main hi ek dalit basti he
 Some time ago money came for the development of the Dalit colony, but spent that money in the other ward
 is baar bhi unke badal ke tole main vikaas kii ganga bahi lekin unke tole kii sthiti jas kii tas rahi
 The people of the colony wanted to say this to the Chief Minister
 wo mukhyamantri ko apane tole main laana chaahate the
 'rajiv further states,' People standing on the roadside to meet the Chief Minister, after leaving the Chief Minister's car started shouting a little slogan
 iske jawaab main police or kuch sthaneey logon ne mahilaon ke saath dhakka-mukki kii jisaki vajah se yah patharbaji hui
 'aaj Tak also tried to talk in the dalit community but this attempt was unsuccessful due to frequent phone calls
 is bich ek video footage aayaa he jisamen kuch sthaneey mahilaayein or purush is baat kii shikaayat kar rahe hai ki police raat main unke gharon main ghus rahi he

 Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's foldable smartphone is coming soon
 is smartphone kaa ek video jari kiya gaya he
 a double-folded smartphone can be seen in it
 isse pehle bhi shaomi kaa hi ek video aayaa tha jisamen company ke chif foldable smartphone yuj karte hue dikh rahe the
 Recently Samsung and Huawei have launched their foldable smartphones, but none of them are in the market
 yah company kaa doosraa video tiger he jisamen dabl fold smartphone dikhaaya gaya he
 This video is of 10 seconds and has been shared on the Chinese micro blogging website Weibo
 ise utyub par bhi aplod kiya gaya he
 The double folded smartphone can be seen in this video and there is also swipe gesture
 Galaxy Fold or Huawie Mate x kii tarah ye van fold nahin hota he, balki ye tu fold hota he
 According to the report, Xiaomi's foldable smartphone can be launched between April and June this year
 khaas ye hoga ki isaki keemat samsung or huaave ke foldable smartphone se sta hoga
 At present, the company has not said anything about the launch of this smartphone
 gauratlab he ki is mobile world congress main foldable smartphone chhaae rahe
 But Xiaomi did not perform the foldable showcase even during this time
 lekin is saal ke aakhir tak market main teen se chaar companiyon ke foldable smartfones market main jarur honge
 It can be guessed by watching the video that this smartphone is slightly bigger and different from the foldable ones of Samsung and Huawei
 kyonki samsung or huaave ke foldable smartphone ek baar mudate hai, lekin is foldable smartphone ko tu fold kiya ja saktaa he
 There are thin bezels all around the display of this smartphone

 In this lady friendly version, Doritos will be less crunchy and less vocal
 yahi nahin, ab snacks kaa packet bhi alag andaaj main najar aayega joki ladakiyon ke bag main aasaani se feet ho sake
 According to the company, market research has shown that women do not like to eat chips with very loud voice
 garlfriend se shaadi ke baad aise badal gai meri jindagipepsico siio indira nui ne new york post ko bataaya, aapane kai ladakon ko chips khate dekha hoga or chips jab khatm ho jaati he to ve apni anguliyaan bhi chaatane lagate hai
 The remaining chips in the packet are also eaten by dusting the packet as he likes it very much and in any case he does not want to suffer the loss of the broken chips left in the packet
 mahilaayein bhi aisa hi karnaa chaahati hai lekin ve karti nahin hai
 They do not eat loudly in public places and they do not lick their fingers either
 company ke is faisle kii aalochana kii ja rahi he
 Many believe that such steps will further strengthen the gender stereotype
 ladke or ladakiyon ke bich chali aa rahi soch ko or badhaava milegaa
 Like girls should not eat with voice, they should not laugh openly etc
 iske alaava logon ne is par bhi jor diya he ki mahilaon ke liye samaan keemat par chota packet laane ke kadam se kai customer usase duuri bana lenge

 During this time, a fierce battle was also witnessed between Virat Kohli and Mitchell Johnson, playing fiercely
 bhartiya pari ke 64wein over main kohli ne janson ko do chauke jade, to janson ne kohli par fabtiyaan kas deen, haalanki kohli ne is par kuch kaha nahin or sirf ek kutil muskaan bikher di
 After this, the result of a mutual tussle between the two players in the 82nd over was narrowly avoided

 But Johnson threw and caught the ball in the followthrough

 pahchaan ke liye
 The conclave has photographs of many big figures

 Whereas my father wanted to remain in the UPA

 Ultimately, we preferred to go with the BJP

 'is Bollywood a club? On this question, Ranveer Singh said, 'bollywood is like a jungle
 main apni ladaai lard rahaa hum
 i got suggestions but no help

 You have to make your own place
 bas aapako maukey kii talash main rahanaa chahie jaise mili, chaukaa jad do

 Be it BJP or Congress
 main kisi kaa samarthan nahin karata
 Inflation is coming down
 puri duniya kii arthvyavastha main sudhaar ho rahaa he
 The next government will get better platforms for development
 bhrashtachar ek mudda he, chunauti bhi he
 But there is a hue and cry about it
 mujhe ye nahin pasand
 This has hurt policy making
 naukarshah faisle lene se dar rahaa he
 It is impacting development
 rojgaar nahin paidaa ho rahe hai
 Unemployment has increased
 agar aisi sthiti bani rahi to hamaara haal bhi arab kranti kii tarah hoga

 Parties should leave aside their ideological differences and think about India's sovereignty, Kashmir peace, employment of youth and justice for Kashmiri Pandits
 Very unfortunate that Article 370 is being converted into a liberal vs conservative debate
 Parties should put aside ideological fixations & debate what's best for India's sovereignty & federalism, peace in J&K, jobs for Kashmiri youth & justice for Kashmiri Pandits

 The Supreme Court asked the petitioner to go to the High Court and file a fresh petition
 iske baad yachikakarta ne apni shikaayat waapas le lee
 This petition claimed that thousands of people disappeared or were killed by security forces during the insurgency in Punjab

 shahari kshetron main vistaar ke liye rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ne nai ranneeti apanaai he
 Under which the residential society will be made the center of publicity in different cities
 yani gramin or semi-urban kshetron se nikalakar aresas ke prachaarak ab bade shaharon kii socity main har daravaaje tak pahunchenge
 To increase this scheme of door-to-door campaigning, the 'head of apartments' will be appointed, which will convey the message of the Sangh to the people
 ye pramukh ghar-ghar jaakar apni socity yaa apartment main logon tak sangh ke vichaaron ko pahunchaayenge or unhen apane saath judane ke liye prerit karenge
 According to the news of the Delhi-based 50 Society English newspaper Indian Express, under this urban scheme of propaganda of the Union, appointed chiefs in cities like Delhi, Noida, Bangalore, Lucknow, Agra, Meerut and Gurgaon where there are apartments and society culture
 Will go akele rajdhani dilli main aisi 50 socity chinhit kii gai hai, jahaan prachaar pramukhon kii niyuktiyaan kii jaaengi
 RSS worker will be the head The responsibility of the head of the apartment will be given only to an RSS worker who has knowledge of the branch

 The apartments will perform major weekly and monthly events
 saath hi wo logon ko sangh kii shakhaon main hissaa lene ke liye prerit bhi karenge
 Indeed, the RSS believes that a large population of the city is shifting in society culture
 lekin in logon tak aresas kii shakha or uske kaarykram nahin pahunch pate hai
 This is the reason that a plan has been made to appoint an apartment chief to spread the views of RSS among the educated and employed sections of the society

 Madhya Pradesh has created history
 keval isliye nahin ki congress ke barkhaast do vidhayakon kii bahaali ke liye vidhaayi itihaas main pehali baar rajya main vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa gaya he balki isliye kyonki congress ne khud apane vidhayakon kii bahaali kaa virodh kiya
 Interestingly, the ruling party BJP was openly supportive of him
 pichley dinon vidhansabha satr ke dauraan congressi vidhayakon ne apni ek maang ko lekar jamkar hangaamaa kiya tha
 He did not allow speaker Ishwardas Rohani to come out of the room and threw papers on the table, climbing on his foot
 ye vidhayak vyavsaayee dilip suryavanshi or sudhir sharma ke thikaanon par pade iskar chhaapon par charchaa kii maang kar rahe the
 These businessmen are said to have relationships with senior BJP leaders
 spikar ke saath durvyavhaar or sadan main hangaamaa karne ke aarope main agle hi din, 18 july ko, bhind se vidhayak choudhary rakavsh singh chaturvedi or mahidpur kii vidhayak kalpana parulekar ko barkhaast kar diya gaya
 The resolution to end their membership was passed in the Vidhan Sabha by voice vote
 is ghatana se congress kii baanchhein khil gayi kyonki isse use bijepi kaa virodh karne kaa thos mauka mil gaya
 In the Congress Legislature Party meeting, it was decided that all the mlas of the party will collectively resign in protest against disqualification of Parulekar and Chaturvedi
 mukhyamantri nivas kaa gheraav bhi hua
 Efforts were on to spread the fire of protest across the state that suddenly the sacked mlas themselves poured cold water on it
 parulekar or chaturvedi ne party line se hat kar or pradesh sarkaar ke numaayindon ke saath milakar spikar ko maafinama de diya
 After this, the whole scenario changed
 bijepi ne vidhayakon kii bahaali ke liye vishesh vidhansabha satr bula liya to congress ne inaki bahaali ko asanvaidhanik qaraar de diya
 Congress has lost its face
 uske vidhayakon ke is kadam se party ke haath se bijepi ko gherne kaa ek mudda chhot gaya he
 Hazarilal Raghuvanshi, president of the state Congress discipline committee, says, "it was a big issue that went hand in hand
" lekin vidhansabha spikar ayogy vidhayakon ko waapas vidhayak kaise bana sakate hai
 "state Congress president Kantilal Bhuria is in a dilemma, he is neither able to oppose nor support the mlas
" haalanki party kii laaj bachaane kii khatir unhone yah aarope jarur laga diya ki mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or spikar ne vidhayakon ko daraa or dhamka kar maafinama likhvaya he
 Leader of the Opposition Ajay Singh also admits that he had no idea about the apology
 congressi saansad sajjan singh verma poochhate hai, ''kya adhyaksh yaa vidhansabha inhen behaal kar sakate hai?'' lekin spikar ishvardaas rohani vidhayakon kii barkhaastagi hi nahin, bahaali ko bhi uchit tehraate hue kehete hai, ''barkhaast vidhayakon ne faisle par punarvichaar kaa aagrah kiya tha or apane kiye par khed bhi jataayaa tha
 It was only then that the decision to call a special session was taken
 adhyaksh ke paas nirnay lene ke aseemit adhikaar hote hai
 "chief Minister Chauhan also justifies the reinstatement of mlas, while constitution expert and former advocate general Ravinandan Singh says," The constitution does not give unlimited powers to anyone
 '' is faisle ko lekar bijepi bhi ekamat nahin he
 BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Raghunandan Sharma says, "the decision after disqualification is through a court or election
 '' prashn to uthta hi he ki chunaav ayog jis sthaan ko rikt ghoshit kar chukaa he use bagaiyr chunaav ke waapas bharaa hua kaise ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this event will create another history
 or vah is baat kaa ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne vidhansabha kaa ek ghante kaa vishesh satr janhit ke mudde ko lekar nahin, balki apane shakti pradarshan ke liye bulaayaa tha

 iske jawaab main sani leone ne kaha ki bhartiya film jagat main ruthik roshan or priyanka chopra ke badan sabase shandaar hai
 After launching the DVD 'super Hot Sunny Mornings', Leon said, "priyanka's body is very structured

 jiske saamne haar kaa khatra ho, use gathbandhan bana lenaa chahieh chanakyamit shah ke ulat nitish kumaar or lalu yadav pracheen rajnatik guru chanakya yaa unke rajnatik darshan ke prashansak nahin maane jate
 So, in the summer of May 2014, one morning when Lalu persuaded his daughter Misa to call his old rival friend Nitish on the phone, he spoke about how the Modi wave benefited from their separation and the political politics of the two If the future was drowned in him, then he did not need Chanakya's gnome to understand this
 unke saamne haar kaa sankat nahin tha balki ve haar kaa kadaa swaad chakh chuke the
 He felt that more such bitter doses were yet to come
 gathbandhan bananaa vakt kii najaakat thi, lekin yah kaam jitna aasaan dikhataa tha, utana vastav main tha nahin
 In a state with a fierce political rivalry like Bihar, bridging personal and political differences seemed a big task
 iskaa shrey inhen donon netaaon ko jaataa he ki inhone alag-alag doobane kii bajaae ek-duusare kaa haath tham kar saath tairne kaa faisla kiya
 Perhaps this was the reason that on Sunday 8 November, Nitish was not among the crores of people who got up early and sat down to watch the democratic drama of Bihar
 isaki bajaae nitish ne kuch or der tak soe rahanaa munasib samajha, baavjood iske ki ve tadake hi uthne ke aadi hai
 They knew by heart that the hard marathon race they have run with Lalu in the last 18 months is not going to go in vain
 ve pichley teen din lagaataar jamini str se feedback lene main vyast the or kahin se kuch bhi nakaaratmak nahin tha
 He woke up at about nine o'clock with some friends and sat in front of the TV with a roasted bangle and herbal tea
 iske baad unke paas phone kol kii baadh aa gai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call came at around 10:30
 modi ne nitish ko kamyaabi ke liye badhai di or kaha ki yah janadesh unke kaam main logon ke bharose kaa parichaayak he
 As sweet as his victory was, his vengeance proved far more sweet than that
 yah vahi cameraa tha jisamen baithkar nitish ne pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan modi ke tamaam bhaashan tivi par dekhe the or uski kaat khojane kii ranneeti taiyaar kii thi
 During these months, Modi had roamed all over Bihar and addressed 30 rallies which was unexpected for a prime minister
 nitish ne 230 or lalu ne 251 sabhaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 However, this number did not matter on the day of judgment
 asli matlab to nitish ke janata dal (you) or lalu ke rashtriya janata dal ke mili-jule aankade se tha, jiskaa kanta 243 siton vaali vidhansabha main 178 par aakar thama
 Lalu was on the other side when Nitish's phone rang around twelve thirty
 donon ne is shandaar pradarshan par ek-duusare ko badhai di
 What they had achieved together seemed impossible a few months ago
 inke mahagathbandhan ne bijepi ko dhul chataa di thi
 The return story Eleven months ago, when Nitish had come to Delhi on a cold December morning, if anyone had predicted the possibility of victory, he would have dismissed it as a lewd joke
 yah sach he ki argedy or congress ke saath unki party ke gathbandhan ke baad agast 2014 ke up-chunaavon main ukvamid kii ek kiran dikhaai di thi
 The votes received by these parties were also sufficient
 ati pichhadaa, mahadalit or musalamaanon ke samarthan se jedy(you) ko loksabhaa chunaavon main 16
 04 percent votes were received
 yadav or musalmaan ke mishran se argedy ko 20
 46 per cent of the votes were received while Congress 8
 56 vot hasil kiye
 If combined, a total of 45
 06 fisadi vot banate hai jo ki bijepi ke netritv vaale endie ke 36
 More than 48 percent votes
 iske baavjood nitish achche se jaanate the ki chunaav sirf ganit kaa khel nahin hota
 In addition, taking an emotional step after a poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, he resigned to make Mahadalit Jeetan Ram Manjhi the chief minister, a move that also began to reverse
 maanjhi ek ke baad duusare vivaad ko janm dete ja rahe the
 Nitish's record of good governance was being discarded, as corruption had replaced him and people were becoming disillusioned
 samasya yah thi ki chunaav bamushkil das maheene dur tha
 After the defeat in Lok Sabha, Nitish had met party workers from across the state and knew that his party's future was not going to end
 iske baavjood kaaphi kuch kiya janaa abhi baaki tha
 On the other hand, successive victories in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand brought bjp's rise to an unbeatable position
 isiilie disambar kii ek subah jab nitish dilli main 37 saal ke ek yuvak prashanth kishor se milane aae, us vakt unki ummiden rajdhani ke suraj kii tarah maddhim thim
 Kishore was a health worker in the United Nations who can be given some credit for Modi's spectacular victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 kishor modi ke chahete the jinhone unhen 7, rescorse tak pahunchane ke liye ek nae chunaav prachaar praaroop ko gadha tha jo america raashtrapati ke chunaav kii tarj par tha
 In October 2014, Kishore's relationship with Amit Shah deteriorated and that of JD (U) Rajya Sabha MP Pawan
 verma ke sampark main the
 He had expressed his desire to work with Nitish
 verma ne is noujvaan ke bare main nitish ko bahut prabhaavshaalee dhang se bataaya tha jiske baad nitish unase milane ko raji ho gaye the
 Kishore advised Nitish that he should return to the post of Chief Minister again
 yah kaam jitani jaldi ho sake, behatar hoga
 It is believed that Nitish may not have immediately responded to this, but he agreed with him
 nitish ke shashan ke bare main kishor ne pehle se thodaa adhyayan kar rakhaa tha
 He was deeply impressed by how a chief minister coming from a small Kurmi community with just three per cent of the vote is maintaining equal trust among all sections of caste-ridden Bihar
 nitish kii saakh thi, unka sushasan kaa acha record tha or acha pradarshan karne vaale ek netaa kii unki chhavi kaayam thi
 His balanced power and politically sound conduct gave him additional benefits
 bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi samooche bihar par kabja kar liya tha, lekin kareeb 65 fisadi janata ne tab bhi use vot nahin diya tha or kishor kii nigaah main nitish ke liye yaheen sabase bada avasar maujuud tha
 Nitish's decision to become chief minister again changed the political game of Bihar, but Manjhi's removal was not so easy as he was adamant and there was a revolt within JD (U)
 mahadalit voton par najar gadaaye bijepi ne is sankat kaa laabh uthaaya
 February came when Nitish returned to the post of Chief Minister
 unke paas ab bijepi or modi kii takat se loha lene kii taiyaari karne ke liye mahaj saat maheene the
 The teenagers were taking so much time as enough
 mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar nitish ko hi hona tha, lihaaja maanjhi ke kiye-dhare ko unhen durust bhi karnaa tha or yah dikhaanaa bhi tha ki chijen unke niyantran main hai
 The BJP made the biggest mistake with Manjhi as it changed its script from here & now BJP had boarded the backward political boat instead of good governance
 bihar ke log jaanate the ki mahadalit kii shrenee to darasal nitish kii banaai hui thi, jise unhone tamaam sarkari laabh se nawaja bhi he
 That is why the results on 8 November show that Dalits and Mahadalits have indeed voted for Nitish
 pehali chaal kaa phydamarch se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar rang main aa gaye
 They knew that electricity affects normal life just like roads and education, so they first caught this area
 kaaphi jald karrwai kii gai or pareshan kshamta 1,000 megawatt se zyada bad gai jabaki rajya main 20,000 se zyada jaale hue transformaron ko badal diya gaya
 In a state like Bihar that has been deprived for years, this initiative has made a big difference
 june main nitish ke saath kishor ke aa jane se chizon ko raftaar mili or chunavi ranneeti ke maamle main pahalakadami karne kaa shuruaati laabh nitish ko mila
 The BJP delayed starting its election campaign due to the fear that it might break its rhythm in the middle
 vahiin kishor or unki team ne june main hi bad chalabihar-bihar@2025naamak abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 This program was official, but it engaged more than 10,000 voluntary workers who were going to more than 40,000 villages of Bihar, highlighting the achievements of Nitish government and taking the opinion of the people that in the next ten years What do you want amit shah ne 16 july ko jab bijepi ke chunaav prachaar vaahan kaa anaavaran kiya, tab tak nitish ko rajya bhar se feedback praapt ho chukaa tha jisaki madad se ve apane prachaar abhiyaan ko or behatar tareeke se garh paane main sakasham ho paae
 Another early work by Kishore was that he bought all the billboards and hoardings on all the important routes in the big cities of Patna and Bihar
 kuch hi dinon main nitish or lalu kii tasveeron vaale laal or sunahare billboard dikhaai dene lage
 After the names of the candidates were announced, new billboards with their photographs were also installed
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki logon ne samay se pehle hi chunaav main dilchaspee leni shuru kar di
 Kishore did not get the benefit of just the first move
 nitish ke kareebi jedy (you) ke ek netaa bataate hai ki unke lagaae hordingon se “nitish ke pratyaashiyon main bhi manovaigyanik badlaav dekhne ko mila
 Suddenly, cadre workers of a non-cadre party started taking themselves seriously and people also became serious
 ” aise kai kadamon se hausala badhata gaya or aakhirkaar 30 agast ko patna ke gandhi maidan main mahagathbandhan kii vishaal raily main puraa bihar hi umad aayaa
 If Manjhi had been an irritant to Muktinitish from the past who had spent some of his labor and time, Lalu could have proved a headache for him
 nitish vyavasthit or nape-tule insaan hai jabaki lalu unke thik ulat hai
 Both of them have absolutely different style, preferences, concerns and politics
 nitish kii sari chhavi sushasan ke sahare bani thi jabaki lalu apane kandhe par apana vot bank ladakar chalane vaale netaa the
 Apparently, it was not in Nitish's strength to have a sudden rapport with Lalu
 ek se zyada maukon par ve lalu ke saath manch saajha nahin kar sake or unhone yahaan tak kah diya ki ve dabaav main kaam nahin kar sakate
 There was an open statement between the two
 lalu ne jab 8 june ko nitish ko gathbandhan ke mukhyamantri ke chehre ke bataur sweekaar kiya tha, to unhone kaha tha ki ve jehar pine ko taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, Nitish went to Sonia Gandhi's party in Delhi instead of going to Lalu's Iftar party on 13 July
 donon netaa 20 july ko jab purv mukhyamantri es
 N
 sinha ke janm-shatabdi samaaroh main shaamil hone gaye, tab lalu ne 45 minute ke sambodhan main kam se kam saat baar is baat kaa zikr kiya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ke peeche unka haath he
 Nitish did not react and remained apathetic
 ek din baad unhone twit karke apni tulana chandan ke ped se kii jo apane irdagird lipte jahrile sanpon se beasar rahata he
 By this time it seemed as if the alliance would break
 tabhi nitish chupchaap ek din lalu ke ghar gaye or donon ne kareeb ghanta bhar saath main bitaayaa
 After this, the two were never found publicly making statements against each other
 siton ke bantwaare par jab donon saath aae to gathbandhan majboot dikhne laga
 It also had the credibility of Nitish's good governance and Lalu's solid vote bank
 nitish kaa sabase bada daanv congress ko 41 siten dena tha jabaki uske sirf paanch vidhayak the
 This strategic mistake seemed obvious at the time, but inadvertently the result was that 17 percent of the Muslim voters of the state stood firmly with the Grand Alliance
 jo nuskhe aaj nayab dikh rahe hai ve bahut sahaj theah lalu ke saamaajik nyaay ke palade ko nitish ke aajamaae hue sushasan ke palade ke saath baraabar taula janaa tha
 Both were intended to empower the poor and the underprivileged
 mahilaon ko ek tabake ke bataur vishesh ahmiyat di jaani thi
 Apart from this, the word "bihari Vs Outer" was for everyone
 patna sthit asian deveopment research institute ke shibal gupta kehete hai ki bihar main sadak, bijli or buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke sandarbh main nitish ne jati / varg nirpeksh laabh dene kaa kaam kiya he
 He says, "lalu, on the other hand, has been a symbol of the backward rise in the state
 sachaai yah he ki aap pichhadon ko sangathit kiye bagaiyr sampradayikaran se nahin lard sakate
 Therefore, Nitish and Lalu had to revive the mandal-kamandal politics of the early nineties
 ”endie ke ghatak dal jahaan siton ke bantwaare par ladate-jhagadate rahe, vahiin nitish ne lalu or congress ke saath chupchaap yah sauda kar liya
 It was finalized at once, giving the impression that the alliance was strong
 yah kaam aasaan nahin tha
 Despite having 115 seats in the previous assembly, Nitish not only decided to contest 101 seats but put more than two dozen JD (U) seats in Lalu's bag
 iske badale main lalu se unhen sirf ek seat mili
 It is different that many JD (U) candidates got a place in Congress
 nitish kii ek or ranneetik chaal yah tay karne main rahi ki ve or lalu ek-duusare ke pratyaashiyon ke liye ghanghor prachaar karenge
 He also held publicity meetings for the Congress candidates and conveyed the message that the alliance is strong
 nitish kii shant bhangima ko logon kaa samarthan mila
 He was not deterred by the sharp, intense, deadly and divisive blows of the BJP
 nitish ne hamalaa bhi kiya to unhone modi ke adhure vaadon par hi sawaal uthaaya
 The Mahagathbandhan also did not delay in carrying out the statement of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on review of reservation
 kishor ne aarakshan khatm karne sambandhi bijepi kii yojana par 20 lakh se zyada sandesh whotsap par bheje
 Apart from this, he assured that in every rally of Lalu and Nitish, a large number of leaflets should be distributed on which offensive messages are printed
 unhone yah bhi tay kiya ki modi or amit shah kii har raily ke baad yaa to lalu yaa phir nitish 24 se 48 ghante ke bheetar pados main hi ek raily karenge
 The idea was that the statements of Modi and Shah could be cut off in front of the people
 modi ke liye “jumala babu” jaise dilachasp naam bhi gadhe gaye
 The ideology of the youth of Bihar was knowing that Modi was drawing huge crowds in his election meetings and most of the young voters clapping on his promises were
 unhen rangeen tivi yaa skuti dene ke bijepi ke vaade nitish ke apane vijan dastavej ke saamne nirarthak sabit hue
 The youth who attended Nitish's meetings used to clap loudly when they promised him free English speaking training
 bihar kii 31 fisadi aabaadi 30 saal se neeche kii umr kii he or nitish isaki nabj ko samajhate the
 In Bihar, 245 seats each have an average of 85,000 voters below 30 years
 loksabhaa kaa chunaav jedy (you), sipii, congress-argedy or endie ke maidan main hone se titarafa tha
 This time the election was completely polarized
 uske baavjood nitish ko sabase zyada samarthan yuvaaon kii ore hi mila
 Apart from these youths, there were also around 25 lakh voters in Bihar who voted for the first time between 18 and 19 years
 in matadaataaon ke janm se kam se kam chah saal pehle hi mandal kii lahar main hindi pattee kii raajnneeti kaa kayakalp ho chukaa tha, lihaaja inaki smriti main lalu-rabari kii argedy sarkaar kaa daur nadaarad tha
 That is why he did not mind Jungraj's allegations
 is tabake kii ladkiyaan us vakt skool main padhati thim jab nitish ne mukhyamantri cycle yojana shuru kii thi
 He voted Nitish fiercely
 aaj nitish jab bihar main apni sarkaar kaa nayaa kaarykaal shuru karne ja rahe hai, to unhen is jeet tak pahunchane vaali apni kathin or kaanton bhari raah ko yaad rakhana hoga or un vividh samoohon ko bhi, jinhone unka lagaataar saath diya he
 There will be ups and downs in this game of power that to deal with, he and Lalu will always have to remember the skills with which they are able to deal with each other and all the allegations made by the NDA
 yah in diggajon ke upar he ki ve is janadesh kii suraksha karte hue use or shashakt banaate hai yaa phir apni adoordarshita se ise nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Nitish realizes this, it is evident from his statement to India Today, "this is a people's mandate, we bow down and accept
 mujhe bihar ko vikaas ke agle paaydaan tak le jane ke liye mehnat kerani hogi
 "at the moment, he and Lalu can take the time to celebrate this Mahajeet

 Honeypreet, who dreamed of being a prisoner of rapist Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim in jail, would himself one day get behind the bars of the jail, he never thought
 ab use jail main khud ek timaardaar kii zarurat pad rahi he, kyonki vahaan use kai bimariyon ne gher liya he
 Actually, Gurmeet failed to get Ram Rahim out of the police custody, Hanipreet Insakhud wanted to stay in jail with him
 is chahat ko puraa karne ke liye baqayada ek farji medical certificate taiyaar karavaaya gaya tha
 In which it was clearly written that Honeypreet Gurmeet is an attendant of Ram Rahim
 vah uski bimariyon se waakif he
 Therefore it is very important for him to stay close to Baba, because Gurmeet Ram Rahim is unfit
 lekin jail prashasan ne pehle se hi doctoron kii ek team kaa intjaam kiya hua tha
 The one who had medical examination of Gurmeet Ram Rahim declared him fit
 or tabhi gurmeet ram rahim or haniprit kaa ek saath rahane kaa sapana chur-chur ho gaya tha
 Honeypreet Insa, who lives like a queen in the palaces of Gurmeet, in need of Timardar, is in a worse condition behind bars
 9 dinon tak police lowep main rahane ke baad ab use agle 23 din ambala central jail main bitaane hai, kyonki maamle kii agali sunwaayee 6 november ko nirdhaarit kii gai he
 Jail for Honeypreet, who sleeps on velvet mattresses, now has a dirty dirty bag and the hard floor of cell number 11
 kabhi baba gurmeet ke saath dedh karod rupee se bhi zyada keemat kii lagjri car main ghoomane vaali haniprit insa kaidiyon kii vine main baithkar ambala pahunchi
 That too not on the van seat but on the floor of the seat
 taaki logon kii najar us par na pade

 sutron kii maane to panchakula ke sector 23 thane main remand par liye jane ke baad police adhikariyon ne ek raat uski jamkar dhunaai bhi kii thi, taaki vah saare raaj ugal de
 The need of the timber has been reduced due to the physical and mental suffering of Honeypreet
 saath hi use migraine sahit kai bimariyon ne bhi gher liya he
 Brightness is missing from his face
 vah biimaar najar aati he
 He needs rest
 halaat ye he ki ab use khud ek timaardaar kii jarurat he
 His illness is increasing and food and drink has reduced
 ram rahim kii phikrogel main takalif bhari jindagi ji rahi haniprit insa ko abhi bhigurmeet ram rahimaki chintaa lagi rahati he
 His love and affection for Gurmeet has not diminished
 9 dinon kii police remand ke dauraan haniprit ne kai baar gurmeet ram rahim se milane kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 He told the doctors that Baba had a backache
 vah usase milanaa chaahati he
 Meanwhile many big festivals like Karvachauth, Dussehra and Diwali passed
 jail main jab uske maa-baap milane pahunche to vah foot-foot kar rone lagi
 She wanted to talk to her family a lot, but the time was over
 medical praaanpatron kii hogi jaanchagauratlab he ki gurmeet ram rahim or haniprit ne deraa ke do doctoron or dilli ke do nami doctoron kii madad se ek juthi medical report banavaai thi
 Based on which Honeypreet Insa wanted to stay in jail with Baba as an attendant
 wo medical report police ke haath lag gai
 a copy of it is also available to this day
 ab police gurmeet ke farji medical ke alaava vipasana insa ke medical certificate kii bhi jaanch karwaanaa chaahati he
 It is clear that apart from Honeypreet and Gurmeet, there is going to be an increase in the number of doctors who provided fake medical certificates

 Just as we teach our child the importance of eating everything including eating, dressing, brushing, it is also necessary to tell them about 'good Touch' and 'bad Touch'
 bacchon ke saath bad rahe chhedhkhani ke maamalon se unako bachaane ke liye yah behad jaruri he
 'good Touch' and 'bad Touch' refer to the intent of the toucher
 koi shaks aapako kis niyat se chhu rahaa he, yaa vah kis jagah, kis tareeke se chhu rahaa he- isi se pataa chalata he ki vah good tach he yaa bed tach
 However, it is also important to give the child the right information about his body parts before telling about it
 bachche ko kaise samajhaayen tach ke bare main :1
 When the child is four years old, then start talking to him
 use yah samajhane kii jarurat he ki use kis par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Explain to him that he should not go away with anyone
 koi anjaan use kuch khaane ko de to use vah cheez turant munh main nahin daalani chahie
 2
 bachche se khulkar baaten karen
 There should be no hesitation in saying your words to him
 use aisa nahin laganaa chahie ki agar wo aapako kuch kahegaa to use daant pad sakati he yaa aap uski baat ansuna kar denge
 3
 bachche ko good tach or bed tach bataane ke dauraan aapako sanyam se kaam lenaa hoga
 Maybe he takes time to understand things
 use privet parts ke bare main bataaen
 Explain to him that nobody can touch him at this place
 4
 Tell the child that he does not need to go close with anyone
 agar use koi god main bithaane kii baat kahe yaa choomanaa chaahe to vah inkaar kar de
 5
 bachche ko ye samajhaayen ki agar use kuch bhi ganda lag rahaa ho to wo apane mata-pita ko turant bataa de
 Prepare the child in such a way that he trusts you completely and shares every small and big thing that happens with you
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne somvaar ko centre sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki vah jokhim bhare ilaakon main sena ke liye kaam karne vaale sahaayakon (porter) ko behatar bhugtan, chikitsa suvidha, badi hui aarthik sahaayta or seva se alag hone kii sthiti main 50,000 rupee kii prastaavit raashi se adhik kaa anudaan dene ke liye ek yojana taiyaar kare

 a bench of Chief Justice TS Thakur and Justice AM Khanwilkar issued the directive and said that these assistants come from very poor sections of society and may not have educational qualifications but they provide significant support to the army and the border Localities are an integral part of campaigns
 tippaniyan The court ordered that the plan for these assistants be finalized in three months and it also disposed of the petitions filed by 29 assistants
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 In a four-page letter to Congress on Sunday, Barr said, "although this report does not conclude that the president committed the crime, this report does not absolve him

 The matter was overshadowed by Trump's nearly two-year tenure

 Barr said that despite the offer of several people associated with Russia to "help Trump's propaganda campaign," Muralr found no evidence of such a conspiracy

 The letter stated, "based on the Special Advocate's final report on these issues, in consultation with officials of various departments, and based on the principles of the federal prosecutor, i came to the conclusion that the evidence found during the investigation of the Special Advocate proved It is not enough to do that the President committed the crime of obstructing justice

 saath hi unhone kaha ki shastri kii baaten aparipakv hai or un par dhyaan bhi nahin dena chahie
 Speaking to a private news channel, Ganguly said, "talking like this is not a good thing
 yah sirf unki (shastri) aparipakvata darshata he
 i think that not all of us should pay much attention to his words
 'ganguli ne kaha, 'vah kab kya kah dete hai vah koi bhi nahin jaanata
 i do not want us to focus too much on his statement
 main sirf chahta hum, ki bharat is aakhri test main acha cricket khele
 Moeen Ali admitted - the current Indian bowling attack Bestaganguli further said, "comparing players and teams from different rounds is not right and not possible
 ham sabhi bhartiya team ke liye khele hai, chaahe vah dhoni yaa dravid yaa anya hon, ham sabhi ne ek hi bhartiya team kaa pratinidhitiv kiya he or hamaara khelte hue lakshya sirf bharat ko jeet dilaanaa hota tha
 Ganguly further said, "we support Virat Kohli and the rest of the boys and want him to do well, but comparing teams of different times is not the right thing
" 'pichhali bhartiya tiimon kaa recordbata den, ki dhoni, ganguli or dravid kii captaini main bhi bhartiya team ne videshon main acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Perhaps Ravi Shastri forgot this thing
 ganguli kii captaini main bhartiya team ne jahaan 2002 main england main 1-1 se siries drow karai thi, to vahiin australia 2003-04 main bhi bharat ne siries ko 1-1 se drow karaayaa tha
 Under Dravid's captaincy, India won the Test series 1–0 in 2006 on West Indies soil
 vahiin england ko bhi saal 2007 main usee kii dharti par 1-0 ke antar se haraaya tha
 India also won a Test match in South Africa under Dravid's captaincy
 dhoni kii captaini main bharat ne newjiland kii dharti par 1-0 se test siries jiti thi

 'kumkum bhagya' ke 4 janvari ke episod main purab ne pragna, daadi or daasi ko apane plan ke bare main bataaya jisase abhi or pragna ek duusare ke kareeb aa sakate hai
 The three like the plan of the East and they apologize to him that they misunderstood him

 However Abhi tells him that he does not want to talk about the two of them
 iske baad tanu or aalia pragna kaa majaak udaati hai
 Tanu says that now Abhi will be her, Pragya says that this will never happen
 vahiin aalia or tanu pragna or purab ke rishte kaa bi majaak udaati hai
 Aaliya says that when Purba said that he loves Pragya, she felt bad because sometimes she loved Poorab
 iske baad vah pragna se kahati he ki ab abhi usase nafrat karata he isliye use ghar chhodkar chale janaa chahie
 The comments pragna un donon se kahati he ki wo donon kitna bhi plan kar len uske or abhi ke bich koi nahin aa saktaa he

 is bich purab abhi ke paas jaakar kahata he ki use ek baar uski baat sunani chahie
 But Abhi tells him that he does not want to talk to her
 iske baad vah khud ko blem karata he ki aakhir usne pragna par bharosa kyon kiya
 On the other hand, when Pragya returns home, Sarla asks her about Poorva and her pictures

 After this, Tanu and Alia make fun of Pragya
 tanu kahati he ki ab abhi uskaa ho jayega is par pragna kahati he ki aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 At the same time, Alia and Tanu make fun of Pragya and Purab's relationship
 aalia kahati he ki jab purab ne kaha ki vah pragna se pyaar karata he to use bura laga kyonki kabhi vah purab se pyaar karti thi
 She then tells Pragya that Abhi hates her so she should leave the house and leave
 tippaniyan Pragya tells them that no matter how much they plan, no one can come between her and Abhi
 unhen alag karne main ve donon kabhi safal nahin hongi
 Meanwhile, Poorab goes to Abhi and says that she should listen to him once
 lekin abhi usase kahata he ki vah usase koi baat nahin karnaa chahta he
 He then blames himself as to why he trusted Pragya
 udhar pragna jab ghar waapas pahunchati he to sarala usase purab or uski tasveeron ke bare main puuchhati he
 Sarla also says that why did she go to meet Purab when she started talking about Abhi's music
 is par pragna sabhi ko puri ghatana ke bare main bataati he ki aalia ne use or purab ko abhi kii najaron main giraane ke liye yah sab kiya
 Pragya also tells them about East's plan but Sarla says that this plan will not be successful
 pragna un donon se kahati he ki wo donon kitna bhi plan kar len uske or abhi ke bich koi nahin aa saktaa he
 Both of them will never succeed in separating them

 bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi or saansad pappu yadav ke bich ravivaar ko hui mulaakaat ke baad bihar ke raajnneetik sameekaran badalte dikh rahe hai
 When the two leaders met the media after about an hour of meeting, their style was somewhat different
 maanjhi ne bijepi ko aankh dikhaate hue spasht sanket die ki agar seat shering main sammanjanak baaten nahin huin to unke liye duusare raste khule hue hai
 The meaning of Manjhi is clear that if he is ignored in the seat sharing, then he can contest from the NDA and contest elections and leave the BJP and also hold the hand of Congress
 haalanki maanjhi ne yah bhi kaha ki agar endie se baat nahin bani to vah or pappu yadav saath milakar chunaav ladenge

 The seat sharing is yet to be discussed
 endie main pappu yadav shaamil honge yaa nahin yah inkaa vyaktigat faisla he
 There will be a decision on contesting elections with both of us after 20 July
 NDA main ho sakate hai shamilsutra ke mutabik, pappu yadav bhi endie main shaamil ho sakate hai
 He is in talks with some central BJP leaders
 haalanki, bihar bijepi main pappu ko lekar matbhed he
 But the problem of the party high command is that it wants to come out strong only against the grand alliance of nitish-lalu-congress
 'main votakatwa nahin banuunga'raajnneeti ke maahir khilaadi pappu yah baat bhalee-bhaanti samajhate hai, isliye vah bijepi ko sanketon main chetane se bhi nahin chook rahe
 He said, 'I will not become a voter
 na hi maine jane kii koi arji di he
 But i will fight in a rough alliance
 agar bijepi nahin to congress
