 The condition of nursing services here has been bad for the last one month

 Contractual nurses are demanding regularization, but in the last month, 36 nurses were removed from their jobs for regularization

 But the hospital administration is making the situation worse by evicting the nurses who have been working for years

 That is why new recruits are made instead of hiring old people or regularizing them

 Union Minister Arun Jaitley has fiercely attacked Pakistan expressing happiness over the air strike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Pakistan's Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack
 shanivaar ko ek tivi kaarykram main jetali ne kaha ki pakistan ke andar ghuskar jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki shiviron par safaltaapurvak hawaii hamalaa kar bharat ne uske parmaanu dhauns kii kalai khol di he
 He said, 'pakistan fought the Conventional War (traditional war) with India in 1965, 1971
 kargil yuddh main ve apane sainikon kii laashen tak lene nahin aae or haar gaye
 In this way, the Pakistani army saw that they could not stand in front of India's strong economy and superior military strength in the Conventional War
 'kendriya mantri jetali ne kaha ki pakistan ke saamne do hi vikalp maujuud the- ek, aatankwaadiyon ke jariye proxi waar (chhadam yuddh) or doosraa vikalp jise newclear blf (parmaanu dhauns) kehete hai, kyonki donon deshon ke paas atomi hathiyaar hai
 This time his nuclear bluff was also exposed
 imran ne kaha tha- jang donon ke liye aatmghaateegauratlab he ki air strike ke baad pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii baukhalaahat dekhne ko mili thi
 Meanwhile, Imran Khan accused India of ignoring peace proposals
 unhone kaha ki do parmaanu sampann deshon kii bich kisi bhi tarah kii jang donon ke liye aatmghaatee hogi
 At the same time, Emraan had also expressed willingness to negotiate with India and said that even the 'cold War' is not in the interest of both countries
 imran khan ne kaha, 'do parmaanu sampann deshon ko jang ke bare main sochna bhi nahin chahie
 Even the idea of cold war should not be brought to mind, because it can worsen the situation
 donon deshon ke bich aapasi baatcheet kii ekmaatr rasta he
 The war in both nuclear-rich countries is suicide
 'saboot maangane waalon par barase jetalybalakot main vayusena ke air strike or usamen aatankiyon ke maare jane kaa saboot maangane waalon par bhi jetali ne tikhaa prahaar kiya
 He said, 'political parties and leaders should understand that no army in the world makes public its operational details
 ye desh kaa durbhaagya he or kuch netaaon main is prakaar kii nasamajhi he ki ve aaj saarvajanik jivan main hai
 They are becoming witnesses of Pakistan by making such statements, knowingly and unknowingly
 mujhe lagata he ki janata inkaa wo haal karegi ki pakistan ke tivi main inako tiarapy milegi or hindustan main janata kaa aakrosh bardaasht karnaa hoga
 The US also did not provide evidence after the end of Laden - Jaitley said that the widows of the martyrs of the Pulwama attack, although not the details of the action, were asking for any photographs of the slain terrorists
 ve kah rahi hai ki koi tasviir hi dikhaa di jaati to unke dil ko thandak pahunchati
 It is not impossible to provide a picture with the help of satellite
 jetali ne kaha, 'duniya main kahin bhi koi army yaa air force apane oparational ditels saarvajanik nahin karti
 The US attacked in Abbottabad (pakistan), killed Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and threw his body into the sea and shared no operational details from the world
 Congress leader Kapil Sibal questioned the success of the Indian Air Force air strike Taking a dig at Jaitley said, 'it is unfortunate that such people are in public life
 agar oparation ditels saarvajanik kii gai to kapil sibbal ko hi nahin pakistan kii fouj ko bhi pataa chal jayega ki hamaare kitne miraj ude, kahaan se ude, kitne bam barasaaye or kis raste se aatanki canmp ko target kiya
 "the PAK gave information about the strike to the world due to these 2 reasons", he said that it was Pakistan's army and not the government that first gave information to the people about the air strike
 pakistan ne sabase pehle duniya ko strike ke bare main jaankaree di
 There were two main reasons behind this
 pehla, pakistan main unki fouj ne janata ke bich apni badi chhavi banaai hui he
 How could that country go in front of its citizens and say that Indian airplanes bombed Jaish's camp
 jetali ne kaha ki doosraa kaaran or bhi bada he
 If Pakistan complained to the whole world, see that Indian planes violated our loc, then the first question would arise - what was your loss? Then the international community would see the loss
 
 Which camp was going on there? How many buildings were there in the camp and hundreds of people were staying
 
 swimming pool
 
 There was a gymnasium
 
 Those who died there would ask about them
 
 Who were those people? 
 One by one the names of their BC commanders and old and new fidayeen came to light
 'pakistan pehle de aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai ke saboot'jetali ne kaha, 'pakistan ke saath tab tak koi baatcheet nahin ho sakati, jab tak vah aatanki sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi nirnaayak karrwai nahin karegaa
 That action should be seen by the whole world and Pakistan will give proof of that, then we will think what to do
 abhi baatcheet ke liye awaajen uthaane kaa koi auchity nahin he

 The struggle for power in Bihar is now seen moving in the Assembly in a big way
 ek tarafnitish kumarsomvaar rajyapal ke samaksh sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai or jediu ne congress or rajd ke samarthan vaala patr ravivaar ko rajbhavan main saunpkar 130 vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kiya he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has categorically refused to leave the post before the strength test in the assembly
 rajbhavan ke sutron ne kaha kinitish rajyapal kesarinath treepathi se dopaher dedh baje mulaakaat karenge
 Earlier, the JDU submitted a letter of support to the RJD, Congress, CPI and an independent MLA, claiming that it had the support of 130 mlas in the 243-member house
 bihar ke vidhansabha adhyaksh udai narayan choudhary ne bhi ravivaar konitish kumarako maanjhi kii jagah jediu vidhayak dal ke naye netaa ke rup main manyata de di or party ne kaha ki maanjhi ke pad se istipha dene se inkaar karne ke baad unhen hataa diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, Manjhi, who arrived in Delhi to attend the meeting of NITI Aayog, met Prime Minister Narendra Modi there and it is being speculated that BJP can play an important role in the power test
 udhar, rajyapal ne nitish ke samarthak 20 cabinet mantriyon kaa istipha sweekaar kar liya jinhone shanivaar istipha de diya tha
 Public relations officer of the Governor S

 243 sadasyeey sadan main jediu ke 111 vidhayak, bijepi ke 87, argedy ke 24, congress ke paanch or paanch nirdaleey vidhayak hai, jabaki das siten khaali hai
 The present strength of the Assembly is 117, given the total strength of 233
 'loktantr kaa galaa ghontne se bijepi ko nuksaan hoga'bihar main jadyu vidhayak dal ke nae netanitish kumaarane kaha ki agar bijepi ‘loktantr kaa galaa ghontne’ kaa koi prayaas karti he, to isse uskaa hi nuksaan hoga
 Kumar will formally claim on Monday to form the government in Bihar
 kumaar ne soshal media account par kaha, ‘jis din bijepi loktantr kaa galaa ghontne kaa prayaas karegi, vah apane hi pairon par kulhadi maaregi
 Underlining the statements of BJP leaders, Kumar expressed fear of early dissolution of the Bihar Legislative Assembly and strongly opposed it
 unhone kaha ki chunaav baar baar nahin hone chahie or sarkaar ko kaam karnaa chahie or chunaav samay par hone chahie
 He said, 'the majority is with us

 Indian mythology turned Ravana's sister Shurpanakha into a villain
 
 
 lekin yah upanyaas na sirf uske bahaane stri aazaadee ke pakshon ko rakhata he balki maryaada purushottam ram kii bhi nae sire se padtaal karata he
 There is a story of female rebellion against the dignity of men
 ''chal, bal, kaushal se apane ko sansar bhar main shreshth tathaa mahaan pratipaadit karne kaa lobh jo tumhaare bheetar jad jamaaye hue he, use main acchhee tarah dekh sakati hum
 Even if you try to hide it with a lacquer cover
 ” ''tumne ahilya ko charnon se sparsh kyon kiya? kisi bhi samaaj kii unnati nari ko samuchit sammaan die bina ho nahin sakati
 Don't you know this! " As such, every moment in the novel, the voice of women's freedom and her rights is articulated under the pretext of Shurpanakha's character
 lekin isamen vaishrawani urf shurpanakha ke ye kathan kuch sutara hai jo upanyaas ke marm ko saz karte hai
 Indian religious history coined characters like Rama to enhance the dignity of men and made women like Vaisravani a villain
 isaki vajah shaayad yahi he ki purushon kii gadhi in kathaon ne naitikta kii sari thekedaari striyon ke kandhon par daal di
 The theme of Shurpanakha is the hallmark of this
 upanyaas yah sawaal uthaata he ki ek stri jo sirf apane prem ko abhi-vyakti karti he, uski naak kaat lenaa, kahaan kii maryaada he
 Under the pretext of this story, the Odia writer Chaudhary is not only successful in keeping Shurpanakha's favor but also exposes the deception of the gods on behalf of men on the pretext of female characters like Ahilya, Mandodari, Tara
 phir chaahe vah ram hon, indra hon yaa lakshmana
 Not only this, Shurpanakha also casts a demon character like Ravana on how she allegedly weaponized her sister for her own emancipation or conceit
 ''purush bas nari ko yuddh ke liye bahaanaa hi nahin banaate, chaare kii bhaanti prayog bhi karte hai
 The novel presented explores a vivid theme
 sambhav he agar yah hindi kii rachana hoti to ab tak yaa to vivaadit ho chuki hoti yaa pratibandh jhel rahi hoti
 Such efforts are negligible in Hindi literature
 maithilisharan gupt kaa mahakavy saket bhale hi lakshmana kii patni urmila kii pidaa ko abhivyakt karata he, lekin usamen aisa teevr vidrohi swar nahin he
 It has a tradition in Odia
 mahabharat kii pramukh paatr draupadi par aadhaarit pratibha raay kaa upanyaas draupadi isaki misaal he
 Although it is very difficult to break the anti-women images of Hindi literature and religious stories that have taken place in the eyes of Hindi readers, it is good that this is happening in other Indian languages
 is vajah se aise upanyaason ke hindi main hi nahin balki anya bhashaaon main anuwaad kii jarurat he
 Vaishravani is a commendable effort in this direction
 bhashaa thodi mushkil jarur he lekin yah shaayad puranic kaal ko darshane or use pakadaaey kii vajah se he
 But it does not stop in front of the flair of the narrative
 kahana na hoga, prastut rachana ko is nazariye se padhaa janaa na sirf dilachasp he balki behad jaruri bhi he

 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati announced a coalition in Uttar Pradesh in a joint conference with Akhilesh Yadav, the national president of the Samajwadi Party
 iske saath hi mayawati ne soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton kaa formula saamne rakhaa
 Under this, SP-BSP will contest 38-38 seats and two seats are left for allies
 baaki bachi do siten yani amethi or raibareli aisi hai jahaan sapa-basapa gathbandhan congress ke khilaaf chunaav main ummidavaar na utaarne kii ranneeti apanaai he
 Mayawati said that Congress will not join this alliance
 unhone kaha, 'ham kisi bhi aisi party ko gathbandhan main shaamil nahin karenge jisase party yaa gathbandhan ko nuksaan pahunche
 However, after this, he also announced not to contest the candidate of the coalition against Amethi and Congress in Rae Bareli to heal the Congress trouble 
 mayawati ne kaha, 'amethi or raibareli, yah donon loksabhaa kii siten hamane congress party ke saath bina koi gathbandhan kiye hi unke liye chhod di hai, taaki bijepi ke log in donon siton par congress party kii sangrakshak va unke adhyaksh ko uljhaakar na rakh saken
 However, Samajwadi Party did not field candidates against Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in earlier elections
 lekin basapa ummidavaar maidan main hota tha
 At the same time, Congress did not field its candidates against SP in seats like Kannauj and Mainpuri
 darasal, mayawati ne apane is kathan se yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan congress ke khilaaf nahin he balki endie ke khilaaf he
 This is the reason why he decided not to contest the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli, so that the Congress could not face any problem in the electoral arena against the BJP there
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki agar sapa-basapa gathbandhan in donon siton par apane ummidavaar utaarte to congress ke liye pareshaani zyada bad sakati thi
 In such a situation, Congress President Rahul Gandhi would remain entangled in Amethi and would not be able to give time to surround BJP in other states of the country
 bataa den ki is donon siton ko chhodane ke peeche ek badi vajah yah bhi maani ja rahi he ki loksabhaa chunaav najeeton ke baad congress ke saath gathbandhan kii raah ko khole rakhane kii ranneeti he
 In the recent assembly elections of three states, both the SP-BSP contested against the Congress, but after the results came, they supported the Congress in forming the government
 jaipur main jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ne haathon main tirangaa lekar bharat mata ke jayakaare ke saath desh bhar ke logon se apil kii ki is tarah kii baton par aapas main nahi laden
 Seeing the way in which NIT of Kashmir and Mewar University of Chittor in Rajasthan are fighting with each other for hoisting Jammu & Kashmir and external students and speaking Bharat Mata ki Jai, close to J&K, studying at Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur
 500 students gathered on the amar-jawan Jyoti to give the message of unity
 jammu-kashmir ke chaatr-chaatro ne kaha ki ham apane desh se pyaar karte hai or isiilie ham ise ek rakhane ke liye yahaan jute hai
 There is a need to learn the students and leaders who are quarreling after seeing these children
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya he ki agar unki party 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main jitkar kendra main sarkaar banaati he to garibi rekha ke neeche sabhi ko ek nunatam aay dene ke liye universal basic inakam (UBI) yojana ko lagu kiya jayega
 At the same time, the current Modi government at the center has also been working on the Universal Basic Income Scheme for nearly two years to provide relief to the people below the poverty line
 kendra sarkaar ne aarthik surveykshan 2016-17 main pehali baar ubiai kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki desh main garibi unmoolan kii disha main ubiai ahm bhoomika adaa kar saktaa he
 It is evident that the exercise of both Congress and BJP is to entice the poor people to vote in the upcoming elections
 lekin, kya he universal basic inakam or kya ise lagu karne ke baad desh se garibi kaa namonishaan mit jayega
 What is UBI? UBI is a fixed income that all the citizens of the country - poor and rich, employed, unemployed get from the government
 is aay ke liye kisi tarah kaa kaam karne athwa paatrata hone kii shart nahin rahati or adarsh sthiti he ki samaaj ke prayek sadsy ko jivan-yaapan ke liye nunatam aay kaa praavdhaan hona chahie
 Why UBI? UBI is not a new concept but has been in the limelight for the use of redistribution of income throughout the world during the last few years
 kai deshon main is yojana par payalat project chal rahaa he, haalanki bataur yojana ise abhi kisi desh main lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 There are two important arguments behind the implementation of UBI that inequality is increasing rapidly globally and unemployment is increasing rapidly due to automation in this era of technology
 kuch jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki maujuuda vyavastha ko yadi sahaara nahin diya gaya ko samanta main teevr ijapha or berogari ke tufaan se sabase badi vaishvik chunauti khadi ho jaaegi
 How will UBI work? According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, there are three important aspects of the future UPI scheme - universal, unconditional and institutional
 vahiin iske aankalan ke liye garibi rekha nirdhaarit karne ke liye suresh tendulkar formule se 7,620 rupee prati varsh tay kiya gaya he
 Man's livelihood is possible on this annual income
 vahiin ek anya survey ke mutabik is dar par ubiai ko lagu karne par jidipi kaa 4
 9% of the expenditure will be on the state exchequer
 skim ke tahat yah suvidha diarect benefit transfar ke jariye pahunchaai jaaegi
 Why the question on UBI arose? According to the model given by the Economic Survey 2016-17, the poverty line in the country has not been properly assessed
 jahaan tendulkar formule se 22 fisadi jansankhya ko garib bataaya gaya vahiin iske baad hue si rangarajan formule ne 29

 While for urban areas this expenditure 33

 The Land Acquisition Bill is to be introduced in the Lok Sabha on Monday, but the Congress has clearly said that it does not want any change in the 2013 Land Law
 bill ko lekar loksabhaa main bahes shuru ho gai he
 There may be a power test between the government and the opposition on the controversial land acquisition bill in the Lok Sabha
 modi sarkaar ke mantriyon ne is bare main rasta nikaalane ke liye raajnneetik partiyon se baatcheet kii
 After meeting with the opposition parties, government sources said that despite opposition from the Congress, the government will put the bill on Monday for discussion and passage, and an eight-hour time has been fixed to discuss it
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha, 'ham upie sarkaar ke 2013 main laae gaye bhoomi bill main koi badlaav nahin chaahate hai
 Asked if his party would accept an amendment to it in view of the concerns of different parties in the government, he said - where does the question of accepting the amendment arise when we are saying that there should be no change in the earlier bill 
 -input bhashaa se Bharatiya Janata Party national president Amit Shah responded to the questions raised by the opposition on the air strike of the Indian Air Force and the entire incident after the Pulwama terror attack on the platform of India Today Conclave
 saath hi pakistan ke daavon ko bhi khaarij kiya
 Amit Shah said that the Army has given evidence of India's action and the questions raised within the country are working to make Pakistan happy
 india today tivi ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne amit shah se air strike ke sabooton ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par jawaab maanga to unhone sena dwaara saboot rakhane kii baat kahi
 Shah said that the army has given evidence of what happened and the people of the country should decide whether to trust the army or not
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne ye bhi kaha ki jo tathy sena ne rakhe hai, un par shankaa karne kii koi vajah nahin he or jo shankaa kar rahe hai, wo pakistan ko khush karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 In fact, on the night of 26 February, by air strike across the loc, the Indian side claimed that a large number of terrorists have been piled up targeting the Jaish terror base in Balakot
 media reports main saikadon kii sankhya main iske aankade aae, lekin pakistan ne aadhikarik taur par ye kaha ki bharat kii strike se unki sarhad main koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 There is also a contradiction in the international media about the death toll from India's Keki strike

 However, on Thursday, the army, air force and navy held a joint press conference claiming that the target we had set in Balakot has been met and they have all the evidence

 In the bribery case, Sai's lawyer Kalpesh Desai told India Today, "narayan Sai and others are being implicated in false cases so that Asaram Bapu and Sai can be further implicated

 Desai, however, refuses to divulge his details, saying that the matter is in court

 The apartment belonged to Prahlad Kishanlal Sevani, a builder and longtime follower of Asaram

 He found 42 large boxes and many documents in computers and hard disks

 Eventually, it revealed the vast network of fraud and crime associated with Asaram and his ashrams
 aisa police kaa daawa he
 Asthana wrote in his letter in early 2014, handing over the case to the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department for a thorough investigation, "the massive seizure of Asaram and Narayan Sai traces the seized documents and hard disk
" isamen deshbhar ke vyapaariyon, kaarobaariyon or real state dealron ke bade paimaane par naam bhi darj hai
 These people used black money for their professional and personal benefit from this business

 "the specifics mentioned by the Surat Police while taking the case forward, it gives an idea of this huge fraud

 But even after 18 months, the Income Tax authorities have been able to show only modest progress

 He told India Today, “we have investigated the matter thoroughly and the order of confiscation has been issued
 iske nattejey jaldi hi saarvajanik kiye jaaenge
 By the way, India Today's investigation, based on the seized documents, reveals that Asaram and his son have a long, dark chapter of a vast empire that has stood for decades
 mote taur par anuyaayiyon ke chande se ikattha kiye gaye paison or ashramon kii bikri se kamaaye munaafe se sood-byaaj kaa ek bada tantra jaisaa banane kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 Apart from this interest-bearing business, seized documents also reveal suspicious land deals
 gujarat, maharashtra, andhra pradesh ke saath-saath kai madhya or uttar bhartiya rajyon main jameen-jaaydaad kaa adhigrahan kiya gaya
 Around 400 ashrams and religious centers have been opened by Asaram and his followers almost everywhere
 jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik, paise ke sandigdh lenden ke liye kareeb 800 bank khaaton kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 Mukesh Patel, assistant commissioner of religion and rich police, alleges that a lot of land owned by Asaram is illegal
 narayan sai ke khilaaf balaatkaar ke maamle kii jaanch kii aguai patel hi kar rahe hai
 He says, "these lands have been acquired through luring and encroaching devotees who have wrong documents
 ” akele gujarat main sabarkantha jile ke perrmal ashram or motera (ahmedabad) tathaa surat ke asaram kendron par prashasnic or police karrwai ke baad ashram ko gaiyr-kanoonee dhang se kabjai gai jameen ko khaali karne par majaboor kiya gaya
 The 54-year-old Ninesh Shah, who has been fighting a case against Asaram for years, is the perfect example of Asaram's alleged mannerisms
 unke aaropon ke mutabik, barason pehle 1978 main asaram ne shah ke pita rajnikant shah ko, jo us vakt unke anuyaayi the, ahmedabad ashram ke najadik apni milkiyat kii 15,300 gaj jameen “tohfe main dene” ke liye raji kar liya
 At that time the price of this land was 20 lakh rupees
 kuch saal baad shah ke pita ko ehsaas hua ki unhen to jhansa dekar lut liya gaya he, kyonki jameen kaa rajasav ab bhi vahi chukaa rahe the jabaki jameen par kabja asaram kaa tha
 So, they asked for the land back
 is maamle ke aaj santis saal ho chuke hai
 Shah's father has passed away long ago
 jameen ke us tukade kii keemat ab 100 karod rupye aanki jaati he or us par ashram kii mahila ikai kabiz he
 Shah says, "he played with my father's feelings and got the land in his name through a gift deed
" jameen kaa rajasav or kar aaj bhi ham chukaa rahe hai or jameen waapas lene ke liye mukadmaa lard rahe hai so alag
 Investigators say this is just one of many examples accusing Asaram and his associates
 jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik, asaram 400 trust yaa nyaason ke jariye apane is puure samrajya par niyantran rakhata he
 Two of these most important trusts are run by Sant & Asaramji Ashram Trust & Sant Shri Asaramji Mahila Utthan Trust & Ahmedabad
 jaanchakartaaon or sevani apartment se jabt dastavejon se sanket miltaa he ki patrikaon, prarthana pustakon or sidi jaisi vyapaarik vastuon tathaa sabun, dhupabatti or tel sareekhe ayurvedic utpaadon kii bikri se, shraddhaluon ke chande se or aksar ashram kii hadpi hui jameen par kheti se bhi ashram ke khajaane main moti rakam ai he
 The bulk of this money earned by illegitimate methods was to reinvest in ashrams or for the welfare of devotees and residents
 lekin jaanchakartaaon kaa aarope he ki inamen se bahut badi dhanrashi isaki bajaae jameenon ke sandigdh saudon main dhan lagane ke liye or sahukaari kaa ek jabardast racket chalaane main istemaal kii gai, jisamen auni-pauni byaaj daron par nakad dhanrashiyaan udhaar di jaati thim
 Insiders allege that the ashram's actors manipulated the records to avoid paying taxes
 surat ke police ayukta rakesh asthana kehete hai, “bazaar main beche jane vaale ashramon ke utpaadon kii packaging ke liye ahmedabad kii ek company ko jo vaarshik theka diya gaya tha, vah 350 karod rupye kaa tha
 Can imagine real turnover
 ”police bataati he ki 2013 main asaram kii giraftaar tak ashram se prakashit do patrikaon&kai bhashaaon main chhapane vaali masik patrika rishiprasad or ek pakshik patrika lok kalyaan sethu&kii 14 lakh pratiyaan har maheene bikati thim jinase salanaa 10 karod rupye ke aasapaas rakam aati thi
 But it is said that the biggest means of collecting money was to have a satsang organized in the number of 50 to give a sermon to the followers & in every discourse of two or three days, only 1 crore was sold from the sale of products
 jute jate the&or asaram ko aayojakon se jo miltaa tha, vah alag
 It is said that most of the money-pullers used to have three or four annual Gurpurnima programs, during which Asaram's organizations get donations of crores of rupees
 kabhi asaram ke pramukh sahyogi rahe or ek dashak pehle “guru” se alag hokar aaj asaram balaatkaar mukademe ke ek gavaah rahul sachaan kehete hai, “unke liye har kaam dhan-batoru kaam hota tha&chaahe garibon ko nickshulk khaanaa baantne ke bhandare hon, baadh sareekhee prakritik aapadaaon ke dauraan raahat ke kaam hon yaa yahaan tak ki go seva hi kyon na ho
 Actually, the amount of 1,650 crore rupees (loan amount) seems to be modest; If it is Rs 5,000 crore
 hoti to bhi mujhe jaraa tajjub nahin hota
 ”people close to Asaram say that 10 to 20 bhandaras were done every year, for which Rs 150 crore

 Even donations were made

 To understand this intricately connected business model, funds for these programs were collected through the 11,000 Yoga Vedanta Seva Samitis established by Asaram across the country and disseminated donations to his magazines

 Chaos erupted when documents were seized during the raid
 ashram ke karmchaariyon ne kathith rup se police ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dene kii koshish kii
 In early 2014, a senior officer of Surat Police was allegedly charged Rs 100 crore
 rishwat dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha taaki vah police ke kabje main pade dastavejon ko kahin gaayab kar de
 But when this attempt went in vain, it is said that C
 Asaram's associate was involved in the investigation
 kumbhaani naam ke ek inspector ko andar tak pahunch banane ke liye laalach dene main kaamyaab rahe
 Abdul Rahman Jabha, the reader of Surat Police Commissioner Asthana, who is considered a highly respected officer for his honesty, was given a similar greed

 It is said that in the financial dealings of Asaram it was considered to be a matter of wani

 Rehman Jabba believes that he has "detailed information about deals that Asaram might not even know properly
 ” adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki asaram aankh mundakar vaani par bharosa karata tha&itnaa zyada ki unke bich najdiki sambandhon ke kaaran narayan sai or uske pita ke bich kai baar matbhed paidaa ho gaye the
 The seized documents reveal that Wani helped invest in immovable properties
 uske kaam karne kaa tarika ek hi thah vah anuyaayiyon ke saath sanyukt saudon kii talash main rahata or phir kisi khaas sampatti ko kharidne ke liye unhen karj detaa
 He then allegedly set a deadline to sell the land and fetch a pre-determined price
 agar keemat main utaar-chadhaav ke kaaran utana paisa nahin mil paata to vah anuyaayi se sirf bank kaa byaaj le letaa tha
 But if that land was sold at a fixed price or higher then the follower would have to share 50% of the profits

 police kaa kahana he ki surat sthit kiraane kii dukaanon kii ek shrunkhlaa sahaj ke maalik kethan patel ke jariye paison kaa prabandh kiya gaya tha
 While the police have nabbed Rupabhai and Patel, IT and ED officials have also been involved in connecting the links for a long time

 In this sense, the film can collect around 8 crores
 haalanki, isaki adhikarik soochna milani abhi baaki he
 Karan Deol and Sahar Bamba's 'the Zoya Factor' and 'departure' have faded compared to 'pal Pal Dil Ke Paas'
 kyonki donon hi film ek hafte main keval 4 karod rupee kaa collection kar pai hai
 Let me tell you that the film Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas has been directed by Sunny Deol and produced by Dharmendra
 agar karan deol (karan Deol) or sahar bamba (sahher Bammba) kii 'pal pal dil ke paas' (pal Pal Dil Ke Paas) kii kahani kii baat karen to film main karan (karan Deol) ek trekking company ke maalik hai, jo manali main sthit he

 rajat bangaluru main 28 saal ke management profeshnal hai
 Her life was full of colorful romance but she still did not find the 'girl' she was looking for
 so, jaise hi unhen apane liye ek sahi ladki mili, unhone parivaar kii marji se shaadi kar lee
 But as soon as they find out that the girl's virginity is intact, they become somewhat disappointed
 rajat ke liye yah aisi saanskrithik aadchan thi jiske lambey samay tak asar hote hai
 Luckily both of them came out of this trouble by having sex in new ways before marriage
 darasal, yah vichaar ab apni rangath khone laga he ki comarya stri kaa sabase bada gahanaa hota he
 And now it is also being welcomed
 isse yah bhi pataa chalata he ki shahari or kasbaai bharat main mahilaon kii jindagi main, khwahishon or ummiido ke badlaav main saamaajik-saanskrithik varjanaaon kaa kitna asar dikhataa he
 Priority of marriage has also fallen behind due to increase in girls' emphasis on professional goals and social activism
 janaganana ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki hamaari aabaadi main akeli rahane vaali mahilaon kaa aankada kul aabaadi kaa 12 pratishat (7
 14 crores), which is a big increase in terms of 'marriageable' age of 20-29 years
 ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki bharat dating / hook-ap ap tinder kaa bhi bada bazaar he
 Due to the recommendations of Tinder Bindass Sex, the clean dating app emphasizing marriage is overshadowing the market
 or ladkiyaan jis daur main vah seemaa langhane ko tatpar hai, jahaan bhartiya striyon ne pehle kabhi pair bhi nahin rakhaa, vahiin hamen pornahab kii haal hi main jari 2015 kii report par bhi gaur karnaa chahie
 According to this report, the Indian statistics of women watching porn increased from 26 percent in 2014 to 30 percent last year
 sankshep main kahen to beete kai dashakon se jari prayaason, shiksha, sakaaratmak sarkari kadamon, nariwadi sakriyataaon kaa asar ab jameen par bhi dikhne laga he
 Not only this, the expression of aspirations and expectations has not been confined only to the 'eminent' sections considered economically and professionally
 lihaaja, anivaary taur par pravritiyon main ek andruni badlaav aakaar le rahaa he
 We can call it a kind of aesthetic progress
 maamla ab sirf jindagi kaa lutf uthaane se badhkar indriya sukh hasil karne kii khwaahish kii ore bad rahaa he yani apni asmita ko pahchaanane kii jarurat par jor zyada he
 The growth of social media and the development of new language to express themselves, present themselves and take selfies has also provided an opportunity for women to enhance their appearance and show it to the world
 aajkal bharat kii zyada se zyada ladkiyaan tivi kii naukariyon kii ore aakarshith ho rahi hai, or apane sharir ko adhik se adhik sexi dikhaane ke jatan karti hai
 This shows that the cultural identity of the body is changing for middle class women
 yah vichaar ab kuch dhilaa padataa ja rahaa he ki stri kaa sharir gaurav kaa pratik hota he (haalanki iske saath hi naitik paharedaari, jatigat hinsa vagairah main bhi ijapha ho rahaa he)
 The biggest symbol of this change is the acceptance of a porn artist like Sunny Leone in the mainstream entertainment industry, which was impossible to imagine even ten years ago
 iske saath ham yah bhi yakeen karne ko majaboor honge ki yahaan tak ki ghrinaa kii had tak striyon—or ab purushon—ko sex vastu ke rup main parosane kaa rujhaan gata he
 The other aspect of this can come out of the question whether women are watching porn according to their desires or enjoying what is made of men's perspective? Can it? What can be the explanation of a happy or free sex life? Often we get caught in the deception that tradition has been 'oppressive' and modernism 'liberates'
 in manyataon main kuch varjanaayen prayogshiltaa ke maamle main jarur tuuti hai
 They are described as: Casual, Experimental, and Open Equals are considered free while Virgin and Missionary positions are considered archaic
 inamen ekaadh sachaaiyaan bhi hai lekin inamen jo bhinnata he, vah nae kaayade bhi bana rahi he
 There are several indicators of immunity, which reveal such an environment
 thrisom yani ek saath teen
 Experience of sex in lift or cab or both
 or doosraa samalangik sex
 From this you come to the conclusion that the atmosphere has been released
 inase bilashak sex ke maamle main ek khulepan or vividhta kaa andaja lagata he
 But these are also examples of consumption of sex
 inase kisi kii vyaktigat khwahishon or nae prayogon kaa pataa nahin chalata isliye isse aise nae niyam bhi banate hai jinhen log sweekaar karnaa chaahate hai
 The question is not whether one's virginity is intact or that he prefers a missionary position, but rather whether we can combine it with fun and relaxation? Does it detract from compulsive circumstances or not? It is also interesting to note that when we virginity (this concept is based on the myth that it should penetrate the male while in reality it is a membrane on the face of the woman's vagina, If it had covered it, women would not have menstruation) and talking about its changing ways, then they are usually referring to the virginity of women
 kinhin vajahon se yah nahin poocha jaataa ki purush comarya ke bare main bhi dharanaen badali hai yaa nahin? purush comarya ke bare main kaisaa anubhav karte hai? 'sex ke maamle main anbhavi' hone kaa dabaav unke manobhaav, rishte or sex santushti par kya asar daalate hai?darasal stri-purush sex sambandhon main badlaav par zyaadaatar bahes-mubahise striyon ke sex rujhaanon par hi kendrit hote hai, maano hamaari sex samskruti kii samasyaayein unheen tak simit hai
 For this reason, masculinity is established as a permanent emotion in a sex-free environment
 aksar ham saanskrithik naitikta—jise sabhi sweekaar karte hai or khulkar rajamandi jaahir karte hai—or vyaktigat naitikta, jo ham akele main sochate or karte hai, ke bich jhulate rahete hai
 Today we talk about success in sex and a kind of consumerist language, which creates the impression that those who do not have sex are losers
 yah baat purushon ke bare main khaas he jo puraane jamaane kii mardaangi or aaj ke daur kii sex unmuktata ke vichaar ke bich fanse rahete hai
 In a serious research for the new multi-media digital project, in the case of Ishq — the term that encompasses sex, love, and lust — women openly say that they want sex but realize they are deceived by men Also remains constant
 isliye sex ke maamle main barabari kii satahi baton main ek gaiyr-barabari kaa bhav bhi lagaataar chipa hi rahata he
 Interaction with sex teachers, counselors and other people shows how unfamiliar people are with their partner's body
 research ke aise koi aankade maujuud nahin hai jinke bal par yah pataa lagaaya ja sake ki kitni mahilaon ko niyamit taur par sex ke dauraan puri santushti milti he
 It is believed that only one in every 3 women in the world gets satisfaction
 2010-11 ke rashtriya parivaar swasthya sarvenkshan ke mutabik, 8
 30 million women use contraceptive pills taken in emergencies while 1
 6 karod purush condom kaa istemaal karte hai yani yah 5:1 kaa anupaat he
 In order to know the changes in the matter of sex, we may have to consider new questions instead of concepts like 'repressed sex feelings and hypocrisy' of the colonial period, only then we will be able to know its truths more fully and equitably
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main ek ladki ne doston kii madad se apane baap ko hi maar daalaa
 23-year-old Kulwinder Kaur aka Nikki not only murdered her 56-year-old father but also took out the pacemaker Sina Chirkar
 ladki ne beete somvaar ko aisa kadam isliye uthaaya kyonki uskaa pita hi uskaa yon shoshan kar rahaa tha
 Police have arrested Kulwinder and co-accused Prince Sandhu and Ashok Sharma in this case
 sandhu ek tatu artist he jabaki ashok ek kapade ke showrooms main kaam karata he
 Sensational facts have come to light in this case
 nikki ne apane do doston kii madad se apane pita ko cricket stump se peet petakar kar marava daalaa
 According to police, this dreadful idea of taking out a pacemaker from the body of Kulwinder, who lives in Khyala area of western Delhi, came about two months ago after watching a crime show aired on TV
 tivi par ek real life story main dikhaaya gaya tha ki mumbai main ek mahila ne apane pati ke saath milakar chachaa ko maar daalaa tha jo us mahila kaa yon shoshan kar rahaa tha
 Similarly, Kulwinder used to hate his father so much that he wanted to kill his father in any case
 use yah bhi pataa tha ki uskaa pita dil kaa marij he or pesamekar ke bina jinda nahin rah saktaa
 The deceased's name is Daljit Singh, who was a taxi driver by profession
 dalajit kii patni yani nikki kii maa teen saal pehle guzar gai thi
 Since then he was sexually abusing the daughter
 ladki ne yon shoshan kii baat shuru main apni donon badi bahanon ko bataaya tha
 But he refused to help
 police ke mutabik 30 april ko ladki ne ghar kaa main get khulaa chhod diya taaki sandhu or sharma berokatoke andar daakhil ho saken
 According to the police, as soon as the girl's father fell asleep, Sandhu and Sharma beat her to death by beating her with a cricket stump
 iske alaava, khidki todakar usase nikle shishe se ladki ke pita kaa seenaa chirakar pesamekar baahar nikaal diya
 After this, the corpse was wrapped in a bed sheet and kept in the car and went to the forested area of uttam Nagar and put it on the hideout

 Memoirs are the most readable in non-fiction genres
 sansmarankar or sansmrit donon pathak ke parichit hon to kitaab ke prati utsukata or bad jaati he
 My literature journey of Bhishma Sahni, i want to see everyone of Dudhanath Singh immortal and three such books which came here apart from the story of Asghar Wajahat testify to this
 saahani ke nidhan ke priaru pandrah varsh baad ai meri sahitya yatra multah punjabi main 2001 main chhapi meri sahit yatra kaa pankaj ke
 There is a quick Hindi translation by Singh
 yah kitaab bhishma saahani ke lekhak banane kii aapbeetee he, jisamen angrejon kaa jamaana, bharat vibhaajan, nehru yug or in sabake bich dhire-dhire aakaar letaa saahani kaa lekhak vyaktitv aa gaya he
 Writing the first story, migration to Moscow, translation, editing and many episodes have come to such a reading that it is known that how many (self) narrators who have given great works could find a place in the heart of the readers after the struggle
 ek jagah ve likhte hai—''jindagi kii kisi sachai ko bayaan karne ke liye lekhak kisi aise madhyam kaa upyog karata he jo yatharth chitra se alag ho, bhale hi kaalpanik ho, par sachai kaa bodh karaata ho to bhi main us ko yathartwaadee hi kahuunga
 "we know that Sahni's autobiography is past and it is not a prelude to her autobiography in the confusion of the literary journey? Like she herself answered it in the book:" i am writing it i am aware that such a description may refer to the development of my creation talent, but the whole environment of a human being contributes a great deal in preparing the ground for his compassion and artistic development
 " yah kitaab lekhak bhishma saahani ke sangharsh kaa bhitari aainaa dikhaati he
 Dudhanath Singh is the greatest narrator of Sathottari generation
 vidroh unka mul swar he or iske liye vidrup se unhen gurej nahin rahaa
 i want to see everyone immortal is his latest book of memoirs, which contains the memoirs of one politician and three litterateurs
 jin pathakon ne unki kitaab laut aa o dhar padhi he, ve jaanate hai ki sansmaran ke liye bhi unki bhashaa kaisaa jaadu rach sakati he jo kabhi-kabhi viraag jaisaa lage or nishthur hone kaa bhram paidaa kar sake
 The self-image of Dudhanath Singh spontaneously emerging in these memoirs is no less important, which is the result of common farmer's uneasiness and uneasiness
 pradhanmantri rahe chandrashekhar kii udaartaa or saujanyta ke samaksh yah tejasvi chhavi pathak main bhi vishwaas paidaa karne vaali he
 The "casual but laughable" picture of Premchand's son and narrator Amrit Rai is a debate far more important than the one that Amrit Rai raised during the tide of the progressive movement
 yahaan raay ko yaad karte hue doodhnath singh us bahes kii smriti ko punarnava karte hai jisaki uttejnaa der tak bani rahati he
 He has written - "you cannot weigh the conscience of a house by celebrating it in a house, the silence inside it identifies it
" beej (amrit raay kaa upanyaas) kii asafalataa or mailaa anchal (fanishwarnath renu kaa upanyaas) kii safalataa kaa rahasy yahi he
 "memoirs on storyteller and editor Satish Jamali and critic and Satyaprakash, professor in Allahabad, are also documents of Allahabad life
 asagar vajahat apni peedi ke sarvaadhik sakriy or bahuvidhai rachanaakaar hai
 Beyond the narrative, there are small but soulful memoirs written on more than a dozen people
 in logon main faij, intizaar hossain, kurratul ain haidar, bhishma saahani, rajendra yadav, nemichandra jain, brajeshwar madan, shehryaar, pramod joshi or arun prakaash jaise jane-maane rachanaakaar hai
 In the role of this book, Wajahat has given serious consideration to the condition and necessity of non-extracurricular genres, which certainly see these genres considered to be marginalized with renewed vigor
 urdu sahitya ke mahaan kathakaar ke rup main jane gaye intizaar hossain ek baar bharat aae or yah ichha jaahir kii ki unhen apni janmabhumi dikhaa di jaae
 Wajahat and some friends took him to Dibai
 yahaan aayaa sansmaran us ghatana kii gavaahi he
 The memoir shows how artificial the lines of division are and how the heat of humanity still connects people on both sides
 isi tarah ve madan ke bohemian sareekhe jivan ke anoothepan ko dekhte hai
 The hidden and untargeted aspects of Bhishma Sahni and Rajendra Yadav's personality have led to the sight of the Wajahat then their guru friend Prof
 kunwarpal singh ke avdaan ko bhi ve nahin bhoolatey
 Undoubtedly, readers will adopt these works reflecting the seriousness and importance of non-fiction genres

 After Antisipatory Bell, Vadra again sought permission to go abroad
 According to the letters, vadrarobert Vadra, who wants to go to Spain this time for business, has sought permission by going to the Rouse Avenue Court to go abroad
 yah duusari baar he jab wadra ne nichali adaalat se videsh jane kii ijaajat maangi he
 Vadra has been awarded an antipissuary bail by the trial court in the money laundering case
 anticipetary bel dete vakt court ne wadra se kaha tha ki unhen videsh jane se pehle court se ijaajat leni hogi
 He has requested to go abroad for the second time after receiving the antisepatriary bell
 pehali baar wadra apane pet ke ilaaj ke liye videsh gaye the
 During the hearing in the court on the plea of robert Vadra to go abroad, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sought time to file his reply on his plea
 12 sitambar ko court is maamle main agali sunwaayee karegaa
 Robert Vadra has sought permission from the court to go abroad from 21 September to 8 October in his application
 wadra ke vakil keties tulsi ne kaha ki videsh jane se judi unki arji ko saarvajanik na kiya jaae, jis par court ne poocha ki kya unki suraksha ko koi khatra he ?haalanki sunwaayee ke dauraan court main idi ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha ki unki suraksha ko lekar kisi tarah kii koi dhamkee nahin he
 This case is unnecessarily being called in the court without any solid basis
 haalanki court ne idi se kaha ki robert wadra kii videsh jane se judi arji se judi jaankariyaan agali sunwaayee tak sil band rakhi jaaen
 ED will oppose permission to go abroad, tell that Robert Vadra is currently out of court bail in the case related to money laundering
 wadra ko agrim jamaanat isi saal april main patiala house court ne kuch sharton ke saath di thi
 The last time Vadra went abroad in connection with his treatment, but this time he has sought permission from the court to go abroad after giving reasons to his business
 sutron ke mutabik, is baar vah spain janaa chaahate hai
 However, when Aaj Tak spoke to the ed's lawyer, he said that on the next hearing, he will oppose the application related to Robert Vadra's going abroad
 agar robert wadra ko baar-baar videsh jane kii anumati milti rahi to vah cese ko kamjor karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Witnesses and evidence can also be tampered with as the strings of this money laundering case are connected to foreign countries
 jis lokapal kii maang ne anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal ko saath kiya, ek takat ke rup main sthapit kiya or ek bade jan andolan ko janm diya, usne hi donon ko dur kar dene kaa bhi kaam kar diya
 Today, of course, Kejriwal is saying that Anna Hazare has been tricked by the Congress or BJP people on the Lokpal Bill, but the truth is that he started this separation
 anna ne apane andolan kii shuruyaat main hi saaf kah diya tha ki vah raajnneeti se dur rahanaa chaahate hai or unka lakshya bhrashtachar se ladanaa he
 But Kejriwal crossed over to Laxman Rekha and formed a party
 yah anna kii vichaardhaara ke khilaaf tha or us samay hi donon main matbhed ho gaye, jisaki parinti ab dikh rahi he
 Now Anna is in favor of passing the Lokpal Bill in its present form
 unka kahana he ki yah bill kaaphi had tak un jaruraton ko puraa karegaa, jinaki baat unhone kii thi
 It will have at least one start
 lekin kejariwal puraani maang par hi ade hue hai or ve kah rahe hai ki unhen jan lokapal vidheyak se kam kuch nahin chahie
 This bill will not eliminate corruption and it will become a way to save the corrupt
 unka kahana he ki yah vidheyak naram he or isse koi laabh nahin hoga
 They are also demanding to liberate the CBI
 itnaa hi nahin ve yah bhi kah rahe hai ki isse congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko milage milegi or ve iskaa shrey le jaaenge
 It is clear that now the paths of both have been separated
 ek raajnneetik dal ke netaa hone ke naate zaahir he kejariwal yah katai nahin chahenge ki anna kisi or dal yaa rajaneta kii tarafdaari karen yaa phir kuch aisa karen ki unke alaava kisi or kii vaahvahee ho
 Now the question is how can Kejriwal decide whether Anna likes or not? Anna knows that a very strict Lokpal Bill is not possible under the present system
 raajnneetik dal uske liye taiyaar nahin honge
 a better way is to start
 lekin kejariwal chaahate hai ki ek jatke main sab kuch badal diya jaae
 However, both are now far away and now they are not likely to sit together and talk about the problems of the country

 prasad ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko bataanaa chahie ki aisi haalat main santvanaa deni chahie yaa raajnneeti kerani chahie
 Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi has also raised questions on the issue of the surgical strike of the army earlier, that is why it can be expected from them
