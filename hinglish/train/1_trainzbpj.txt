 Encouraged by the victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the results of the by-elections in 11 assembly seats to the BJP have already shown a mirror before 2022
 bhaajapa bhale hi saat siten jeetne main kaamyaab hui he, lekin use har seat par vipaksh se kadaa sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 BJP has lost its Zaidpur seat despite strong fortifications in the by-elections
 iske alaava bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat 2017 ke mukaable bahut ghat gaya he
 bjp's poll percentage in almost every seat is also a concern
 sirf lakhanu kaint or balha aisi do siten hai, jahaan party ne 2017 kaa pradarshan barkaraar rakhaa he
 Yes 
 
 rampur main haar ke baavjood party ke vot bade hai
 a total of 60 in this by-election in Gangoh Vis seat of Saharanpur
 30 pratishat matdaan hua
 Despite the victory here, the bjp's vote fell by about eight per cent
 is seat par hue kul 60
 BJP got just 30 in 30 percent polling
 41 pratishat hi vot mili
 a total of 71 in Gangoh seat in the 2017 general election
 92 pratishat vot pade the or bhaajapa ne 38
 It won with 78 percent of the vote
 raajnneetik panditon ke anusaar, vipaksh jab bikharaa hua he tab bhaajapa kii yah haalat he, to yadi vipaksh ekajute hota tab to nattejey hi kuch or hote
 The BJP organization started a campaign to win all the seats from June 22 by giving responsibility to a minister of the government and a state official of the organization
 mukhyamantri or bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh ne sabhi siton par chunavi adhisuchana jari hone se pehle or baad main ek-ek baar jarur daura kiya tha
 Despite this, the party lost the Zaidpur seat
 vipaksh kii ore se akhilesh yadav ek seat par prachaar karne gaye the or unki party ko teen siton par jeet hasil hui
 His vote percentage has also increased in every seat
 bhaajapa ko ghoshi seat par kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa or party pratyaashee maatr 1734 vot se kisi tarah jeet hasil kar paaya
 In 2017, Fagu Chauhan won this seat by more than 7000 votes
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki bhaajapa "bhale hi saat siten jikar utsahit ho rahi he, par jamini hakeekat yah he ki use vipaksh se lagbhag har seat par shikast hi mili he
 About 10 percent vote percentage incident is a big deal
 jis prakaar se 11 siton par sapa duusare number par he, yah bhaajapa ke liye acha sanket nahin he
 One thing is that despite the opposition's disenchantment, we did not get success in 11 seats
 yah aatmachintan kaa vishay he
 Even after the entire army of the organization and the government has come down, our vote percentage has decreased and if one seat is lost, then the party will have to think on its strategy
 adhikari yojanaon ko sirf kagaajon main rakhe hue hai
 Nothing has reached the ground yet
 "varisht raajnneetik vishleshak rajeev shrivastav ne kaha, "upachunaav sabake liye aatmamanthan kaa vishay hai
 bjp's vote percentage has decreased by about 10 percent
 yogi sarkaar kii nitiyaan yaa to jameen tak nahin pahunch paa rahi hai, yaa jameen par pahunch gai hai to kaaryakarta iskaa prachaar thik se nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Why the strategy failed in the seats where the vote percentage decreased
 kaaryakarta naaraaz kyon hai
 There is a need for introspection on these subjects
 haalanki is baar bhaajapa ne apane kaaryakartaaon ko hi tikat die the
 Nevertheless, the results did not come to their attention
 ise pataa karne kii jarut he
 The flaw of the organization has to be found
 mishan 2022 main kaaryakartaaon or yojanaon ko jameen par jaanch kar hi utarana padegaa

 Even today, all questions related to the Sangh, BJP and the government are expected to be asked
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh dwaara dilli main yojit teen divasiy sammelan ke duusare din mangalvaar ko bhagwat ne kaha ki yah dharna bilkul galat he ki sangh mukhyalay nagpur se kol kiya jaataa he or (uske tathaa sarkari padaadhikariyon ke bich) baatcheet hoti he
 This belief is also because the association of President and Prime Minister has been with the Union
 bhagwat ne yah bhi kaha kiareesakabhi apane swayamsevakon ko kisi raajnneetik dal ke liye kaam karne ko nahin kahata he
 He said that the Sangh does not give advice, but instead offers suggestions on demand
 haalanki unhone bhaajapa yaa uske kisi bhi netaa kaa naam nahin liya

 The medical system in government hospitals in Rajasthan has once again collapsed
 doctoron ne 18 disambar se hadtaal par jane kii chetavanee di thi, lekin is bich sarkaar ne sakhti jataate hue 15 disambar kii raat se hi doctoron ko giraftaar karnaa shuru kar diya

 doctoron kii maang he ki medical sevaaon main prashasnic kaaryon main bhi doctoron kii niyukti ho, na ki prashasnic adhikariyon kii
 Also, the working hours of the doctors should be fixed for 7 hours and the current level should be increased

 Hizbul hopes that Riyaz will not allow his people to deviate from the goal of Hizbul

 And when we reviewed a building that is running in which 16 small and big restaurants are running, we found that these security arrangements are not completely correct, but arrangements have been made to deal with adversity
 bataa den ki yahaan maujuud restaraan, bars or food joints jis building main bane hai wo kareeb-kareeb 50 se 60 saal puraani hai
 Despite this, most of the nightclubs running here have taken Fire NOC

 Troubled by complaints of dirtying of blankets in trains, the Indian Railways has prepared an action plan to wash them more frequently and replace existing blankets with designer and lighter blankets in a phased manner
 iske alaava istemaal kiye kambalon ko phir se istemaal kiye jane se pehle niyamit rup se saaf kiya jayega
 On the other hand, some media reports have also said that the Railways is planning to stop using blankets
 chah maheene main ek baar dhulate hai kambalhalankikamblonko har ek yaa do maheene ke bheetar dhone kaa nirdesh he, lekin haal main kaig kii ek report main bataaya gaya ki yahaan kambal chah maheene se nahin dhule the
 However, now soon stinky blankets in trains may be a matter of time
 railway ne rashtriya fishan dizin santhaan nift ko kam oon vaale halke kambal banane kaa kaam saunpa he
 Thin, ordinary water-soluble blankets are also being tested as a pilot project in the Central Railway Zone

 In some sections, the work of changing the cover of the blankets has been started and the work of washing the blankets for 15 days and one week instead of one month is being started
 kambal band karne kii bhi he khabarkuch media khabaron main kaha ja rahaa he ki railway asi coach main kambal ke istemaal par hi roak lagane par vichaar kar rahaa he
 It plans to keep the AC coach temperature so low that blankets are needed
 abhi aisi coach kaa taapmaana 19 degree celsius rahata he, railway ise badhaakar 24 degree karne kii yojana bana rahaa he taaki yatri ko kambal na odhana pade or wo chadar se hi kaam chalaa sake
 The police on Tuesday arrested the main accused in the Murshidabad triple murder case
 murshidaabad ke police adheekshak mukesh kumaar ne bataaya ki utpal behara ko jile main sagardighi ke sahapur ilaake se subah giraftaar kiya gaya
 He is a mason by profession
 bandhu prakaash paal (35), unki garbhvatee patni beauty or unke aath varshiya bete angan ke shav aath oktober ko murshidaabad jile ke jiyaganj main unke ghar main khun se lathpath mili the
 Police said Behera had given money to Pal for two life insurance policies

 Pal and Behera had been in dispute over the matter for the past few weeks
 paal ne uskaa apmaan bhi kiya tha, jiske baad behara ne uski hatya karne kaa faisla kiya
 'the police claimed that Behera had confessed to his crime
 bhagavadhari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh kii gorakhpur se saansad hai
 He has won five consecutive Lok Sabha elections
 lekin adityanath ko sirf vikaas ke naam par hi vot nahin miltaa, asal main unki raajnneeti sampradayik bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaane ke formule par chalati he
 Yogi ji is once again on his old formula
 siyaasi galiyaaron se lekar har chauraahey par unki or unke bayanon kii charchaa he
 Yogi Adityanath is a bsc pass
 26 saal kii umr se hi saansad hai
 He has reached Parliament for the fifth time, but behind this miraculous victory is his hardline Hindutva agenda
 aisa agenda jisase unki takat lagaataar badhati gai
 So much so that whatever the yogi says in Gorakhpur is the same rule, it is the same law
 tabhi to unke samarthak naaraa bhi lagaate hai, 'gorakhpur main rahanaa he to yogi-yogi kahana hoga
 'ajay Singh is the real name of Adityanath, the political pariyogi started in 1998
 vah mul rup se uttarakhand ke rahane vaale hai
 He studied bsc from Garhwal University
 gorakhnath mandir ke mahant avaidhyanath ne unhen diksha dekar yogi banaaya tha
 Avaidyanath retired from politics in 1998 and declared Yogi Adityanath as his successor
 yaheen se yogi adityanath kii raajnneetik pari shuru hui he
 He was the youngest MP when Yogi Adityanath reached Parliament by winning the 12th Lok Sabha election from Gorakhpur in 1998
 hindu yuva vahini kaa gathanrajnneeti ke maidan main aate hi yogi adityanath ne siyasat kii duusari dagar bhi pakad lee
 He formed the Hindu Yuva Vahini and launched a campaign against conversion
 kattar hindutv kii raah par chalate hue unhone kai baar vivaadit bayaan die
 Yogi remained in controversy, but his strength continued to grow
 2007 main gorakhpur main dange hue to yogi adityanath ko mukhya aaropee banaaya gaya
 An arrest was made and there was chaos in this too
 yogi ke khilaaf kai aparaadhik mukademe bhi darj hue
 By now, Yogi Adityanath's status had become such that the gathering would begin where he stood
 wo jo bol dete, unke samarthakon ke liye wo kanoon ho jaataa
 Not only this, even when the festivals like Holi and Deepawali are celebrated, Yogi Adityanath issues decrees from Gorakhnath temple, hence Hindus festivals in Gorakhpur are celebrated a day later
 urdu ban gai hindi, miyaan badalakar mayyogi adityanath ke taur-tareekon kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone gorakhpur ke kai aitihaasik muhallon ke naam badalawa die
 Under this, Urdu market became Hindi market
 ali nagar aryanagar ho gaya
 Mian Bazaar became Maya Bazaar
 itnaa hi nahin, yogi adityanath to azamgarh kaa naam bhi badalawaanaa chaahate hai
 Adityanath argues behind this that the country is identified with Hindi and not Urdu, Arya is not from Ali
 gorakhpur or aasapaas ke ilaake main yogi adityanath or unki hindu yuva vahini kii tuuti bolti he
 He also has a tremendous presence in the BJP
 iskaa pramaan yah he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main prachaar ke liye yogi adityanath ko bijepi ne helicopter muhaiyaa karavaaya tha
 There were riots in Gorakhpur in 2007, in which Yogi was deeply wounded
 lekin iske baad se yogi adityanath kii takat badhati gai or wo hindutv ke swayambhu mathadhish ban gaye
 The election bugle for the Gujarat Legislative Assembly is over
 chunaav ayog ne rajya main chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan kar diya he
 There will be elections in the state in two phases
 bijepi-congress samet sabhi raajnneetik partiyaan puure damakham ke saath prachaar main juty hai
 Just before the announcement of the election dates, 'aaj Tak' has known the public opinion by going public
 ye survey india today group or AXIS MY INDIA ne milakar kiya he
 a total of 182 seats have been surveyed in Gujarat from 25 September to 15 October
 iskaa sample survey 18243 he
 Two positions, BJP has doubled seats in both the survey has been done keeping in mind the two conditions in the state
 pehali sthiti he jab congress ke saath hardik patel nahin he
 That is, when people were asked that if Hardik Patel does not come with the Congress, then who will get how many votes and how many seats
 jabaki duusari sthiti main congress ke saath alpesh thakor, jignesh mewaani ke alaava hardik patel bhi shaamil hai
 According to the survey, the Congress is getting a slight edge with the coming of Hardik Patel, but that too does not seem to be able to get the power of the state
 bijepi donon hi sthitiyon main 22 saal baad bhi satta se dur hoti najar nahin aa rahi he
 The funny thing is that in both the situations the BJP seems to get double the seats from the Congress
 yani congress kii puri koshish ek baar phir dhuladhusit ho sakati he
 First position: The BJP is projected to get 115 to 125 seats in the first position of the survey, while the Congress, which is pushing full power to grab power, seems to be reduced to only 57 to 65 seats
 survey main anya ko 0 se 3 siten milane kaa andaja lagayaa ja rahaa he
 Talking about vote percentage, BJP is getting 48 percent votes in the first position of the survey
 jabaki congress evam uski sahyogi partiyon ko sirf 38 fisadi vot milte najar aa rahe hai
 In this situation, the party supporting Hardik Patel is getting 2 per cent votes
 gujarat main kise kitni seat?congress+alpesh thakor+jignesh mewaani: 57-65 sitbijepi: 115-125 sitahardik samarthit party: 0 sitanya (waghela samarthit party+aap):0-3 sitgujarat main kise kitna vot?bijepi: 48%congress+alpesh thakor+jignesh mewaani: 38%hardik samarthit party: 2%anya (waghela samarthit party+aap):12%duusari sthitisurve kii duusari sthiti main bijepi ko thodaa nuksaan hota najar aa rahaa he lekin vah itnaa maamuli he ki uske liye chintaa kii koi baat nahin he
 The BJP is still standing behind the magic figures needed to come to power
 duusari sthiti main bijepi ko 110 se 120 siten hi mil rahi hai

 "nisha told that later her father adopted her and also supported her
 irani ne is video ko 23 agast ko share kiya gaya tha tab se lekar ab tak ise 1
 68 lakh views have been received
 hajaaron logon ne coment box main tarif kii he
 In the caption of the video, Smriti Irani wrote, "with Lakme Fashion Week you don't just get to learn fashion
 " You must have heard the story of the bickering and quarreling in the mother-in-law's daughter-in-law, but in America, the quarrel between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law increased so much that the daughter-in-law of the 20-year-old killed her mother-in-law
 adaalat ne hatya ke jurm main bahu ko 41 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai he, lekin adaalat main police or aaropee mahila ne hatya kii jo kahani sunai vah rongte khadey kar dene vaali he
 The case relates to Colorado Springs, where in 2013 Elizabeth Rainey killed her 59-year-old mother-in-law, Debra Rainey, with a knife
 hatya kaa pataa police ko tab chalaa jab elizabeth ke padosiyon ne police se shorgul kii shikaayat kii
 When the police arrived at the scene, everything seemed normal
 lekin jab chaanbin kii gai to ghar kii rasoi se storeroom tak haivaaniyat kii had ne police ko bhi sakate main daal diya
 According to the information received from the police, everything was not good in Elizabeth and her husband Jason Rainy and there was a fight between husband and wife
 elizabeth kii ek choti beti bhi he, jisaki dekhbhaal ke liye hi uski saas debra saath rahati thi
 It is said that due to the quarrel between the daughter and daughter-in-law, the family atmosphere was not good and Debra often taunted Elizabeth in this regard
 lekin usne shaayad hi kabhi sochaa ho ki uski bahu kisi din use dardanaak maut ke ghat utaar degi
 Hastain's police told the court that Elizabeth and Debra were alone at home on the day of the incident
 donon main kisi baat ko lekar jhagada hua, jiske baad elizabeth ne pehle to debra ke upar ghar ke saamaan phenk kar waar kiya
 But his anger did not calm down
 elizabeth ne apni saas par khulata hua pani daalaa or phir naak or munh main bleech powder bharkar, chaaku se godakar uski hatya kar di
 Admitting her crime in court, Elizabeth said, 'she never liked me
 main isse tang aa gai thi or isliye maine use maar daalaa
 After the death of his mother-in-law, Elizabeth hid her body in an air mattress kept at home
 yahi nahin ghar kii saaf-safai kar usne sabakuch saamaanya jaisaa kar diya
 But meanwhile, Elizabeth's neighbors complain to the police about the noise
 police maukey par pahunchi to sab saamaanya tha, lekin jab adhikari rasoi pahunche to vahaan chaaku par khun ke dhabbe ne unhen sakate main daal diya
 When the police started questioning Elizabeth after she found a bloodied knife thrown at the child, she tried to run away for fear of being caught
 yahi nahin, iske liye usne apni choti bacchee ko police kii god main phenkaa or bhaag khadi hui, lekin police ne use ghar ke baahar sadak se giraftaar kar liya
 Police report that Elizabeth is suffering from mental illness
 10 saal kii umr se hi use bopolar disorder he or vah iske liye dawa bhi le rahi he
 Sources associated with the Government of Pakistan reported that Monday morning before the NSA talks
 30 ajij or gilaani kii mulaakaat hogi
 However, with this, he told that Aziz will meet other Kashmiri separatists at the Pak High Commissioner's feast on Sunday evening

 Taking a major decision, the Modi government at the Center has abolished the subsidy on Haj pilgrimage
 is saal lagbhag paune do lakh log haj yatra par jaaenge lekin unhen sabsidi kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 Actually, this is a decision whose demand has been arising from time to time from the Muslim section itself
 eimm ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi, kamaal faruki jaise netaa kai baar haj sabsidi khatm karne kii vakaalat kar chuke hai
 Subsidies on air travel In fact, the largest part of the subsidy for Haj pilgrims is spent on air travel
 bharat sarkaar kaa civil aviation mantralay haj cameti of india ke jariye ye sabsidi muhaiyaa karaata he
 This money is given directly to Air India instead of Haj pilgrims
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki haj yatriyon ke naam par di jane vaali ye chhot sirf unheen haj yatriyon ke liye uplabdh karai jaati he, jo haj cameti of india (hcoi) main registerd hokar haj ke liye saudi jate hai
 While Haj pilgrims going through private tour operators (ptos) do not get the benefit
 nai niti ke tahat haj cameti ke jariye 70 pratishat yatri or 30 pratishat yatri privet operators ke madhyam se haj yatra par ja sakenge
 Steps for the betterment of Muslims: Kamal Farooqui, a member of the high-level committee set up to set up Haj policy for the next five years, said that the government has taken a better step for Muslims by eliminating the Haj subsidy
 haj sabsidi se musalamaanon ke bajaay air india ko phayda pahunchaaya ja rahaa tha
 He said that just as the Central Government has taken steps to abolish the Haj subsidy, so should the subsidy given by the government for travel to other religions
 faruki ne kaha ki hamane haj nitiyon main jo bhi maangen sarkaar ke saamne rakhi thim, un sabhi ko sarkaar ne maan liya he
 The Muslims of the country are now completely free to take Haj from any flight and leave the airport as per their convenience
 AIMIM ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi bhi haj sabsidi khatm karne kii maang kar chuke hai
 She said in conversation with Aaj Tak last year that her money should be spent on Muslim girls' education by abolishing the Haj subsidy
 ovaisi ne kaha ki isse unki tarakkee hogi or jisko bhi haj janaa hoga vah jarur jayega
 There is no use of giving Haj subsidy
 chunki isse sirf airlines ko phayda hota he or duusare logon ko phayda hota he
 He said that for the last 10 years he has been raising this matter in Parliament
 itnaa kharch karti he sarkaarek aankade ke mutabik, 2012 main sabsidi par 836 karod rupaya kharch kiya gaya, jabaki 2013 main sabsidi ke taur par 680 karod diya gaya
 It further reduced to 533 crore in 2014
 darasal, 2010 main videsh mantralay ne ek prastaav rakhaa tha, jiske tahat har saal sabsidi main 10 pratishat kii ghatotari kii baat kii gai thi
 After which the Haj subsidy is being cut continuously
 haj par jane vaale yatri haj cameti of india main aavedan karte hai
 For this, they also have to submit the application fees
 haj cameti apane cote ke tahaj jane vaale yatriyon kii list sarkaar ko saunpti he, jo airlines ke saath saajha kii jaati he
 The Haj Committee spends about 25 thousand rupees for a Haj pilgrim
 jabaki privet tour operators kii madad se jane vaale ek haj yatri kaa hawaii yatra kharch isse kahin zyada aata he
 This year the cost of a passenger going to Haj through private operators has come to about 70 thousand rupees
 jabaki haj cameti kii taraf se jane vaale yatri ko yahi kharch 25 hajaar rupee padaa he
 Both these amounts are more than the common traveler going to Saudi Arabia
 haalanki, alag-alag sthanon se ye kharch bhi alag hota he
 Today is 'world Dance Day' and in such a situation, many people checked the reality of their dance spirit
 soshal media par vaise to har jashn ko manaane kaa apana hi ek khaas tarika he lekin world dance de par logon ne khub thumake lagaae or unhen soshal media par share kiya
 In this celebration of dance, many people have also posted videos in some laughable manner

 From Bollywood to South Industry, only Bahubali is being discussed at this time
 phir chaahe film main kalakaaron ke kaam kii tarif ho yaa phir box offis collection kii baat ho
 Meanwhile, news has come that Sridevi, the first Bollywood actress, was approached for the role of Sivagami
 reports ke mutabik film ke diarector eses rajamauli ne pehle is role ke liye shridevi se baat kii thi or unhen kahani pasand bhi ai thi
 But the matter got stuck on fees

 Sridevi chose Puli Movie instead of Baahubali which did nothing amazing at the box office
 bahubali main rani shivgami kaa kirdaar kaa powerful dikhaaya gaya he or unhone apni adaakaari se har kisi kaa dil jeet liya he
 But the thing to think is that if Sridevi had done yes for this role then what would the film have been like

 In the films of Sooraj Barjatya, the hero named 'prem' has always been an ideal person

 Salman Khan recently revealed the secret that this time the love is a bastard type

 Whether it is Mayawati government or Akhilesh Yadav government, the magic of IAS Rama Raman has been going on on both of them
 noida, greater noida yaa phir yamuna express-ve praadhikaran main chaahe jitne bhi bade ghotaale hue ho, lekin rama raman kii kursi barkaraar rahi
 There has been no action till date against this officer who played a key role in the restoration of Yadav Singh
 adaalat ne sunaaya tabadale kaa farmandarasal iees adhikarirma ramankele aise pehle afasar nahin hai
 Joe Noida has been the Chairman and CEO of Greater Noida for a long time
 brajesh kumaar or mohinder singh kaa kaarykaal bhi chaar se paanch saal kaa rahaa
 Lalit Srivastava was also the chairman and CEO twice in BSP for three and a half years
 noida praadhikaran kii sthapana 17 april 1976 main hui thi, jabaki greater noida kii sthapana 28 janvari 1991 or yamuna praadhikaran kii 24 april 2001 ko sthapana hui
 The ceos of the three authorities have been different since inception, but the chairman has remained the same
 HC ne rama raman ke kaam par lagaai rokbasal iees rama raman ko elahabaad hai court ne bada jhatka diya he
 IAS Rama Raman, who was holding the post of Chief Executive Officer of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway Authority, fell on Friday
 elahabaad hai court ne siio ke rup main unke kaam karne par roak laga di he
 Not only this, the Allahabad High Court has also ordered forfeiture of the rights of Rama Raman in its strict instructions
 iske alawapradesh sarkaarko do hafte ke andar inkaa tabadalaa karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The High Court has also said that the state government will have to transfer Rama Raman out of Gautam Buddha district
 ek saamaajik kaaryakarta kii yachika par faislajankaree ke mutabik greater noida or yamuna praadhikaran ke chairman pad par rama raman kaaphi lambey samay se tainaat rahe
 Rama Raman held the post of Chief Executive of Noida Authority and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority for the last 6 years, on which the High Court had objected to Rama Raman's holding 3 posts simultaneously
 bataa den ki saamaajik kaaryakarta jitendra goyal kii yachika par court kaa ye faisla aayaa he, maamle kii agali sunwaayee 20 july ko hogi
 Significantly, Rama Raman became the CEO of Greater Noida Authority in 2009, then also became the chairman of Greater Noida, Noida and Yamuna Expressway Authority in 2011
 hoicourt ne pehle bhi jataai thi naaraazgihaicourt ne ek bade aadesh mentinon praadhikaranke chairman rama raman ke kaamkaaj par roak laga di he
 The court has once again pulled up the functioning of the Akhilesh government over the appointment of senior IAS officer Rama Raman
 bataa den ki hoicourt ne purv main bhi praadhikaran main rama raman kii niyukti ko lekar sawaal uthaae the
 The court had then asked the government, what is the compulsion behind the government's deployment of Rama Raman, why he has been posted in the authority for so many years
 mayawati par bhi rama raman kaa jaadookhaas baat yah he ki chaahe mayawati sarkaar ho yaa phir akhilesh yadav sarkaar sabhi par iees rama raman kaa jaadu hameshaa chalaa
 Whatever major scams have happened in Noida, Greater Noida or Yamuna Expressway Authority, Rama Raman's chair remains intact
 yadav singh kii bahaali main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale is afasar ke khilaaf aaj tak koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Before the current chairman of the trio, Rama Raman, Brajesh Kumar was the first officer to hold the responsibility of the CEO and chairman of Greater Noida for nearly four and a half years
 vah bhaajapa shasankaal main 1997 se 2001 tak siio or chairman rahe
 After this, after the formation of SP government in the state in 2005, he was again made the CEO and chairman of Noida and Yamuna Authority along with Greater Noida
 haalanki is baar unka kaarykaal kareeb aath maheene kaa rahaa
 The court asked the question of not being transferred
 Rakesh Bahadur, chairman of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Authority and Noida CEO Sanjeev Saran, also had to step down from the court's intervention
 donon adhikariyon par noida main hotel aavanton main gadabadi kaa aarope tha
 Both were suspended after the BSP came to power in 2007
 iske baad pradesh main jab 2012 main sapa satta main ai to donon kaa nilamban khatm kiya gaya tha
 Both the officers were again posted in Noida and Greater Noida, against which a PIL was also filed in the High Court
 iske alaava koi bhi adhikari do saal kaa kaarykaal puraa nahin kar paaya
 He was also in the post for a long time, Tayanatarama Raman became the CEO of Greater Noida Authority in 2009
 phir 2011 main greater noida, noida or yamuna express-ve athurity ke chairman bhi ban gaye
 IAS officer Rama Raman is not the first officer to have been the longtime chairman and CEO of Noida, Greater Noida
 brajesh kumaar or mohinder singh kaa kaarykaal bhi chaar se paanch varsh kaa rahaa
 Lalit Srivastava was the CEO and Chairman of Greater Noida and Yamuna Authority from 2001 to 2003 and the end of 2007 to 2009 and Chairman of Noida Authority during the BSP regime
 iske alaava rakesh bahadur bhi do baar noida, greater noida or yamuna praadhikaran ke siio rahe
 His first term was from 2005 to 2007 while his second term was in 2012
 greater noida main yogendra narayan, nripendra mishra, ravi maathur, di es bains, tii jorge joseph, ajay shankar, ares maathur siio ouk chairman aise the, jinka kaarykaal lanbaa tha
 Apart from his early leave, there was no officer in the three authorities who had even completed the two-year term
 adhiktar siio or chairamainon kii chuttee ek saal ke bheetar hi ho gai
 There were many such officers in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Authority, who could not even complete the tenure of six months
 lekin yogesh kumaar, gangaaraam barua, dinesh singh or manoj kumaar singh ek se teen maheene ke andar pad se hataa die gaye
 Crores of scams in the authority
 Now the question arises that why the same officer was made the head of the three authorities, while there are many crores of scams in the authority
 iees rama raman 6 saal se in teenon praadhikaranon ke siio kaa pad sambhaal rahe hai
 Meanwhile, despite all the scams in the authorities, they were not removed
 court ne kaha he ki kai yogya adhikariyon ke baavjood ek hi adhikari ko teen praadhikaranon kaa siio banaae rakhana kai tarah ke sawaal khadey karata he
 The Chief Secretary has been ordered that the committee constituted under his chairmanship should take a decision on the transfer of Rama Raman within two months

 adhik se adhik mahilaayein kaam karne nikal rahi hai or saarvajanik sthanon par pehle se adhik dikhaai de rahi hai, ve saarvajanik thikaanon main purush pradhanta ko chunauti de rahi hai
 Therefore, unwanted eyes also arise on them
 " 2014-15 ke surveykshan main 25 pratishat kishor-kishoriyon ne kaha ki skool main hi unhone sex kiya he
 In the 2016 survey, money became a staple in modern marriages, so "mistrust" continued to go home
 is saal, jab bhartiya purush or mahilaayein apni yonechhaon, bhaavnaatmak jaruraton or fantasiyon ke liye khulti ja rahi hai, ham rujhaan main badlaav ko bhaanpane ke apane 15 saal ke safar kii samiksha kar rahe hai
 The survey reveals that a large number of Indians are satisfied with their sex life
 lekin ghar main khushhaali kii is tasviir ke baahar bhi bahut kuch he, stri-purush ke bich dharanaon, vyavhaar or pasand-naapsand main kaaphi fark he jisase kuch paaramparik samajhadaari kii pushti hoti he to kuch myth tuutate hai
 Do you think one night connection is right? 35 percent of men and women answered "yes"
 jaahir he, yah bhaawanaaon se itar kabhi-kabhaar, achaanak sex kii taraf tikhe rujhaan kaa sanket he
 It is also worrying that the dark side of technological development - from internet, mobile phones to dating and hookup apps - is affecting people's lives
 ''kya internet par pornography dekhne se aapkaa sex jivan prabhavit hua he?" isse 42 pratishat purush or striyaan sahamat hai
 This is why cases of "unwanted or forced sex" are increasing in male-female relationships? 25 percent of urban Indians said "yes" in response
 takreeban ek hajaar sawaalon, 50,000 logon se baatcheet or 15 saal kii avadhi ke baad shaayad ham is sawaal ke jawaab ke kareeb pahunch paae hai ki jab pyaar yon sambandhon main badalata he to kya hota he? aaie hamaare saath un baari badlaavon ke gavaah banie, jisaki talash main ham pichley 15 saal se aadhunik bharat ke band daravaajon or bistaron main jhaankne kii koshish main baari utaar-chadhaav se rou-ba-rou hue hai

 Once, his team at the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) were discussing the security of the building

 But Doklamane turned down the team's suggestion and said that if we do this, birds will not sit on this wall

 According to the former Chief of DRDO, Kalam was quite nervous during the test of 'agni' missile

 He said that if anything went wrong, he would take responsibility for it and leave his post

 Once some youths expressed a desire to meet Dr

 Kalam not only met the youth in the Personal Chamber of the Rashtrapati Bhavan but also spent a lot of time with them and listen to their ideas

 Varun's gestures, words, and targeted fraternity remind him of his late father Sanjay Gandhi, who "forced sterilization" of "muslims, whose population growth rate is becoming a threat to Hindus and Hindustan"
 He was a strong advocate
 lekin jab 1977 main loksabhaa chunaav hue to congress ko dhul chaatni padi or desh main pehali gaiyr-congress sarkaar kaa maarg prashast hua
 The basic difference then was that the Congress was randomly dependent on Muslim votes, but the BJP knows that it will not get Muslim votes
 darasal bhaajapa uttar pradesh main 1991-1999 ke bich hindutv kii laharon vaale apane sunahari din lautaane ko betaab he jab party ko loksabhaa kii kramshah 29, 57, 52 or 51 siten mili thim
 That is why the party is trying to take advantage of this situation and that is why a section of the party, Sangh Parivar and saints and saints have supported Varun
 party kii yojana he ki upree adaalat se raahat na milane par varun ke khilaaf police ke darj maamle main unki sambhavit giraftaar ko party ke sheersh netaaon kii maujuudagi main khaasaa naatakeey prasang bana diya jaae
 The nation will then be reminded that when Muslim leaders like Maulana Bukhari, the Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid, use the same language and dare the courts, there is no courage to lay hands on them
 saamaajik-aarthik or majahabi masalon par musalamaanon kii aawaaj uthaane vaale jafarayab jilani kehete hai ki bhaajapa uttar pradesh main bhi ek modi taiyaar karnaa chaahati he taaki sampradayik bhaawanaaon kaa dohan kiya ja sake lekin isamen vah kaamyaab nahin hone vaali
 Since 1999, the bjp's popularity in the state has been declining since the issue of issues related to Hindu interests were noticed
 1999 main rajya main party ko 27 siten mili thim jo 2004 main ghatakar 10 par aa gayi
 Since then, the BJP was looking for a new Hindu symbol to raise the morale of its workers
 party ne apana khoyaa aadhaar waapas paane ke liye gorakhpur se saansad or hindu hiton ke ugr yoddha yogi adityanath ke samaksh ghutane bhi tech die lekin apni simit apil ke kaaran ve party ke uddharak nahin ban paae
 Now BJP has got a symbol in the form of Varuna
 bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke netaa dayashankar singh sawaal karte hai, ''varun ne kya galat kiya? jansankhya rokane ke liye parivaar niyojan vakt kii jarurat he or is baat se koun inkaar karegaa ki simavarti jilon main pakistan or nepal se hathiyaaron kii taskari ho rahi he
 "varun's verbal attacks on Muslims may satisfy extremist elements for a short time, but in the absence of any Hindu wave, polarization of Hindu votes is not possible behind Varun and ultimately the party
" siyasat ke nausikhua varun pilibhit main pair jamaane ko sangharshrat hai or unke kathith jahrile bhaashanon ne unhen 'hinduon kaa sangrakshak' bana diya he
 He has managed to polarize the votes but his speeches outside Pilibhit do not seem to get any benefit from the party
 ulate une bhaashanon kii pratikriya main pashchimi or tarai kshetra kii darjan bhar siton par muslim voton kaa dhruvikaran hone se unki maa menka gandhi ko muslimon kaa gussa jarur jhelana pad saktaa he
 After the death of the children in Gorakhpur Medical College in Uttar Pradesh, the comments of all the political parties are continuing on one side and on the other hand the state government is giving its arguments in the case
 lekin aspataal main jin bacchon kii maut hui, unke parivaar main matam chaaya hua he
 Today 12-year-old Vandana's school has a holiday, this holiday is not for any festival but because her smart student is no longer in this world
 aspataal kii laaparvaahee se gai jaangruuvaar ko jab vah aspataal gai to apane daadi ke liye pakode laane kaa vaada karke gai magarabiardi aspataal membhartee hone ke baad vandana ne duniya ko alavida kah diya
 His family alleges that due to the negligence of the hospital and the lack of oxygen supply, his little life got angry with him
 apane bhai ko raakhi baandh ke uski raksha karne kii to kasam usne khai lekin apni raksha usne shaayad bhagwaan par chhod di
 That is why God called him to himself
 12 saal kii vandana hameshaa ke liye apane bhai bahan ko chhod kar chali gai
 Perhaps Vandana did not even know that that journey to the hospital would be her last
 varanaa vah apane daadi ke liye pakora laane kaa vaada nahin karti
 Living in a small town of Belipar village, some distance away from Gorakhpur, Vandana was the darling of her home
 guuruuvaar ko vandana ko jab bukhaar chadha to uske baba usko tempo stand tak lekar gaye, tab vandana hansate-khelte apane baba ko bolte hue gai ki wo bazaar se pakora laaegi, par biardi aspataal pahunchate hi vandana ko isiu main bhartee kar diya gaya
 Vandana's uncle Umesh told, 'I was sitting with Vandana, the doctor said that if there is a lack of blood, i gave blood
 uske baad baahar se dawaai lekar aayaa
 Then the doctor said that oxygen has gone bad, so you take this pump and keep pumping with it
 jab subah hui to ekaek vandana naa kuch bol rahi thi, naa kuch kah rahi thi
 The doctor did not give any allegation of the clergy that everything was not fine on Friday morning
 naa vandana kuch bol rahi thi or aasapaas afra-tafari machi thi
 Suddenly an army of doctors reached the ICU
 phir doctor ne vandana ke chachaa ko kinare le jaakar bolaa ki bina shor-sharabe ke vah vandana ke mrit sharir ko aspataal se le jaae
 Doctor Neto did not even give him a single form of treatment for Vandana
 yahi nahin doctor ne kaha ki vah peeche ke daravaaje se jaae or bilkul shor naa kare
 If Vandana's poor family had any wealth, she was their daughter, which they were very proud of
 uske papa majdoor hai, magar apane bacchon ko paalane main unke maathe par kabhi bhi shikan nahin ai
 Today when his daughter is snatched from him, he wants the guilty to be punished

 The controversy over the demand for the removal of the critical dialogue against the government in the South Indian film 'mursal' has caught up a lot
 tamilnadu bijepi unit dwaara film se is dialog ko hataae jane kii maang kii baat congress samet tamaam vipakshi partiyaan bijepi kii ninda kar rahi he
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi also lashed out at the BJP government over the issue
 vahiin madhur bhandarkar ne 'indu sarkaar' ko lekar rahul gandhi kii chuppi par bhi sawaal uthaa diya
 Congress leader and actress Nagma spoke to Aaj Tak over the controversy over actor Vijay's film 'mursal' and the allegations made by Madhur Bhandarkar on 'indu Sarkar'
 baikfoot par 'marsal' ke produsar, kaha- jaruri he, to hataa denge GST se judaa sinaunhone kaha- sawaal yah he ki 'marsal' main kaat-chhaant kii maang koun kar rahaa he? maang kar rahe hai kuch khudgarj log jinhen aisa lagata he ki us film main kuch galat kaha gaya he
 However nothing was said wrong
 uske dialogs ko khud bijepi kii sensor board ne paas kiya he
 When the censor board has passed, there is no question of dispute arising
 kanoon ke hisaab se yah log nirmaataaon ko film se seen kaatane kii jabardastee nahin kar sakate
 The film 'mersal' features a dialogue from actor Vijay, in which he recounts a moment without naming him, and how the children died of oxygen deficiency in a hospital and the supplier of oxygen near the hospital for years
 There was no money to give
 is dialog par bhi aapatti uthaai ja rahi he
 On the bjp-congress clash about the film, close to 100 crores in 3 days, Nagma said- When children were dying in Gorakhpur, Yogi went to Amethi and gave a speech
 hindi main ek kahawat he- billi aankh band karke doodh piti he to use aisa lagata he ki duniya use dekh nahin rahi he
 Yogis are also doing the same
 roj unke ilaake main kitne bachche mar rahe hai or aaj tak aisa ho rahaa he
 Film is a medium
 jo janata bolnaa chaahati he, use film ke dwaara bolaa jaataa he
 When health services are so important, why is it not given attention? After the controversy over the film 'mersal', producer-director Madhur Bhandarkar also jumped in and directly questioned Rahul Gandhi that against 'indu Sarkar' Why did he not raise his voice while the demonstrations were happening? Nagma attacked Madhur Bhandarkar, saying that his film 'indu Sarkar' was a flop film in which the censor board of BJP was decimated
 maine khud 'indu sarkaar' dekhi he
 It was written at the beginning of the film that it is all fictional
 us film main koi acchhee baat to thi hi nahin, naa to samaaj ko acha kaary kar karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Who stopped their freedom of speech
 'indu sarkaar' main kaant chhaant bijepi ke sensor board ne kiya
 The Producers Guild asked for separate authority for cases like Mersal
 "I don't understand why this dispute is happening
" agar congress kii sarkaar hoti or sensor board congress kaa hota to samaj main aata ki usko kaatane kii koshish kii gai
 The film was not banned
 agar kahin kisi ne todphod kii or bijepi, congress ko usamen daalana chaahati he to bataa duun ki rahul gandhi ne us vakt twit kar kaha tha ki main kahin kisi tarah kii todphod ko samarthan nahin karata
 The point is not to compare 'marsal' and 'indu Sarkar'
 yah to ek achche hero kii film he jo ki bahut acchhee kar rahi he or bahut maal masala he
 Vijay is the biggest hero in the South after Rajinikanth
 jo film madhur bhandarkar ne banaai thi usamen koi star cast nahin thi
 According to your thinking, what you put into it, i don't know why it is being made so big
 If this was so, BJP workers would go and watch the film and hit it
 filmon ke tareeke, raajnneeti or filmon par ho rahi raajnneeti ke sawaal par nagma ne kaha ki donon ke bich dashakon purana rishta he jo kabhi alag nahin ho saktaa
 Mersal: Rahul targeted Modi on the pretext of Tamil identity, Madhur said, "where were you then? Film and politics have been related for years and this is not the topic of today and tomorrow
" dev anand, dilip kumaar sahab ko le lijie
 Take MG Ramachandran and NT Rama Rao
 us kaal se is kaal tak yah sab filmon kaa or raajnneeti kaa bahut raajnneetik rishta rahaa he
 Nargis- Take the relationship of Sunil Dutt
 film ke vivaad ke sawaal par lage haath nagma ne bijepi netaaon or saath hi kendriya mantri smriti irani par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Tell me one thing that whatever the Congress did for years, BJP is doing its show case
 nayaa kya kar ke dikhaaya jiske itnaa phudak rahe hai? smriti irani bhi bahut kuch bolti hai lekin kya kiya janata ke liye? ek chandani chowk se ladi thi vah to haar gai vahaan se vahaan palat ke bhi peeche nahin gai
 Amethi speaks of Amethi as Rahul Gandhi is there
 rajyavardhan rathore kehete hai ki rahul gandhi doping karte hai, maidan main bhaagate hai

 However, the work of the Nashik Police and the Mumbai Crime Branch team was completely different
 nasik police jahaan sidhe sajaad kii talash main uske gaanv ja dhamkee thi vahiin mumbai krime branch kii team ne pehle sajaad ke ghar parivaar or doston kii jaankaree jamaa karnaa shuru kiya
 Because the team of Nashik police had to face stone pelting
 sthaneey police badi mushkil se unhen apni suraksha main baahar nikaal kar laayi thi
 It is another matter that for the second time the Nashik police had managed to take the statement of Sajjad's mother
 par sajaad kaa kuch pataa nahin chal paaya tha
 It is learned that Sajjad has three more brothers
 unke naam hai taufeeq, amajid or irfan
 After about 6 months, for the first time, Mumbai Crime Branch team went to Jammu
 sutara bataate hai ki police team ko jammu se apane adhikariyon kii taraf se saaf nirdesh tha ki wo sidhe kashmir main sajaad ke gaanv yaa uske aasapaas nahin jaayegi jab tak ki koi thos suraag nahin mili
 Therefore, Inspector Nikam first started to source in Baramula by staying in Jammu
 saath hi us ilaake kii bhugolic or saamaajik sthiti kii jaankaree bhi jutani shuru kii
 From there it came to know that it is fine to reach Ramban in front of Srinagar but going ahead of it is not empty of danger
 team jammu se hi waapas aa gai or mumbai aakar jammu main banaaye gaye sorce ke jariye talash jari rakhi
 Meanwhile ACP Abhay Shastri returned to his division, police inspector Mahesh Tawde also had to return to the Malad police station in connection with a murder and constable Ajay Ballal was also not part of the team for any reason
 team main rah gayi sirf inspector sanjay nikam or baaki ke 4 sipaahi
 Inspector Sanjay Nikam did not remain calm even while living in Mumbai
 sajaad ke bhaiyon ke naam se internet par soshal site khangalate rahe
 After several days of trying, he found a page on Facebook called Killer
 sajaad ke chote bhai dwaara banaaye gaye us pej par sabhi 4 bhaiyon kaa ek saath ek photo bhi tha
 But the place seen in the photo behind the brothers was different from the village of Sajjad
 dhyaan se dekhne par pataa chalaa ki wo koi aisi jagah he jahaan baandh yaa tunnel jaisaa koi nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he
 Seeing the four brothers together in the photo, it was clear that Sajjad has not escaped into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, he is on the same side and is in touch with his family
 police ke haath bahut bada suraag lag gaya tha
 But the challenge was to identify the place and go there
 is ahm suraag ke saath inspector nikam apni team ke saath ab srinagar ke liye nikal gayi
 For this, he grew his beard, and also changed his dress
 vahaan rahakar unhone kuch aise sorce banaaye jo baraamula ilaake ko samajhate the, vahaan jaan pahchaan rakhte the
 In conversation with him, it was found that not everyone can go to that area
 vahaan kuch aise samvedansheel ilaake hai jahaan jane ke liye kisi bhi bahari shaks ke paas tiarapy yani temporary racidence paas hona chahie
 He should also know that person in the area
 wo ilaaka sena kii nigaraanee main he or jaraa bhi shaq hone par wo goli maar sakati he
 The police team had a double challenge
 agar wo apni asli pahchaan jaahir karte hai to raaj khulne kaa dar tha or pahchaan chhupate hai to goli khaane kaa
 According to sources, during this time, he had to spend a lot of money to build sources and gather information
 bataate hai ki vahaan ke logon ko mithai pasand he lekin vahaan is tarah kii mithai aasaani se nahin milti isliye unhen mithai ke dibbe bhent kar kaam nikaalnaa padaa
 By now, a lot of information had been gathered with the police team
 ye bhi pataa chal chukaa tha ki photo main peeche dikh rahi jagah jhelum nadi par neshnal hydro power kii site hai jahaan nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 From this, it was guessed that Sajjad should not be working at that place
 lekin sirf andaaje par hi vahaan jane kaa jokhim nahin liya ja saktaa tha
 However, it has been learned that Inspector Nikam somehow reached the village of Sajjad once after putting a jugaad
 lekin jab ye jaankaree mili ki vahaan 20 se 25 ghar sajaad ke mughal parivaar ke hi hai or ek aawaaj par sabhi jamaa ho jate hai isaliye vahaan jaraa bhi jokhim mol lenaa munasib nahin tha
 It was also learned that Sajjad, instead of staying in his house, used to keep coming to his uncle Sarif's house in Jabar area, 4 km from the village
 vahaan kuch karnaa uske gaanv se bhi jokhim bharaa tha
 The police team once again came back to Mumbai and waited for the opportunity
 mithai vaale sorce kaam me lage rahe
 In the first week of October, it was reported that the work of construction of a large project is going on in Sonamarg, about one and a half thousand workers work there
 salamabad se bhi kai ladke us site par mazdooree karte hai or vahiin rahete hai
 Meaning Sajjad had a strong possibility of being there
 soochna milane ke baad inspector sanjay nikam apane teen sipaahiyon ke saath nikal gaye
 Srinagar to Mumbai and from there to Sonmarg
 srinagar hawaii jahaaj se gayi the isaliye bandook or hathkadi le jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 In such an area where there is possibility of attack on stone pelting, police and army also, there could be 4 people unarmed, anything could happen
 lekin sajaad ko pakadana tha wo bhi bina sthaneey police kii sahaayta liye kyonki baat li hone kaa dar tha
 In the local veneer, the team did not go directly to that site and went to the surrounding village first
 khud ko telephone company kaa afasar bataakar telephone tower lagane ke liye survey karne aayaa he bataaya
 People who were facing the double whammy of terror and poverty showed a source of income and they agreed to give land for it
 lekin police kaa lakshya to un mazdooron tak pahunchnaa tha
 Therefore, the condition of bringing the necessary laborers to build the tower was given to the land owners
 paisa aata dekh bhala koun manaa karegaa
 Those people called some contractors from where the construction work was going on in Sonmarg
 unase kotesan maanga gaya or mazdooron ke kaam dekhne ke liye us site par le jane kii shart rakhi gai
 The contractor was ready and within a short time the team was among those workers
 ittefaq se jis thekedaar se mulaakaat hui thi uske mazdooron kii list main sajid naam likhaa tha
 The police had foreseen that Sajjad might resort to another name to hide his identity and that Sajid was similar to Sajjad, so the police wanted to see Sajid
 thekedaar kaa uski taraf ishaara karte hi police team ko use pahchaanane main der nahin lagi
 But no one hurried nor let the joy of finding Sajjad come on his face
 team waapas chali gai
 The next two days kept looking for a chance to pick him up
 lekin wo construction site se baahar nahin aayaa
 Now the police had no choice but to go and capture Sajjad among the workers
 takreeban 100 meter dur gaadi khadi kar sipaahi dayaa kamble or sandip kamble ko driver ke saath usee main baithe rahane ko kahkar impector nikam sirf ek sipaahi sandip talekar ke saath sajaad ke paas gaye
 There was a big pit just behind Sajjad where he was working and was afraid that if he runs away he might fall into the pit and if this happens then the matter will not be delayed and nothing will be said after that
 isliye impsector nikam pehle us gadde kii taraf sajaad ke bilkul kareeb khadey hue phir ek haath se uske haath ko dabaaya or bole, "sajaad tuje mere saath chalanaa he
 "and released his hand
 lekin tab tak saath main gaya doosraa sipaahi tay yojana ke mutabik duusari taraf se sajaad se satakar khadaa ho gaya
 According to Inspector Nikam, Sajjad took root at the place as soon as he heard his voice
 use kuch samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ham koun hai or kya chaahate hai? hamane uskaa haath bina pakade hi sharir se dhakka dekar aage chalane kaa ishaara kiya or usase saamaanya baat karte karte gaadi ke paas laaye
 Everything happened so peacefully that even the laborers working nearby could not understand anything
 gaadi kaa darwaja kholkar jaise hi use gaadi main bithaaya gaya andar baithe sipaahi dayaa kamble ko dekh kar wo pahchaan gaya or uske munh se aawaaj nikali "are sahab aap?" dayaa kamble wo sipaahi hai jo mukademe ke dauraan vishesh sarkari vakil ujwal nikam kii madad ke liye hameshaa adaalat main maujuud rahete the
 Sajjad knew him well and Daya did not even have a beard so Daya Kamble was asked to sit in the car
 sajaad or kuch bolta yaa harakat karata tab tak doosraa sipaahi bhi uske bagal main baith chukaa tha or gaadi bhi vahaan se nikal chuki thi
 The inspector Sanjay Nikam, sitting on the seat next to the driver, turned back and gave Sajjad an apple and said "eat"
 sajaad ko pahachaanate der nahin lagi or bol uthaa nikam sahab aap hai? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him
 tab sajaad kaa jawaab tha, sahab us paar jindagi nahin he
 There is nothing but poverty, unemployment and livelihood, so i wanted to live here
 iske baad kii kahani to jag jaahir he
 How important Sajjad's arrest was can be gauged from the fact that Mumbai Police Commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar himself announced his arrest
 unhone bataaya ki jaise hi mujhe sajaad kii giraftaar kii soochna mili maine sabase pehle pallavi ke pita purkysth ko phone kar bataaya to unki aankh main aasuun aa gaye
 He said that i was waiting for this moment
 police ayukta ne puri team kaa parichay patrakaron se karaayaa
 The comments kadalathi se pahalwaan lagane vaale inspector sanjay nikam 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main bhi morcha sanbhaalane waalon main rahe hai
 He was in the property cell at that time
 property cell ne hi saal 2008 main indian mujahidin ke pune modul ko pakad kar aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin kii qamar todi thi
 Then Arun Chavan was in charge of the property cell and Shripad Kale, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Nikam and Ajay Sawant were important part of that team
 uske pehle tak paheli rahe indian mujahidin ke liye wo bada jhatka tha
 a large number of his terrorists were also caught in Ahmedabad and Karnataka after that
 us samay divangat aar aar patil rajya ke grahamantri the unhone 5 lakh rupee inaam dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But later he resigned after the 26 / 11 terror attack and that promise was just a declaration
 hairaani kii baat he ki saal 2000 se 2008 tak desh main aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaale sanghathan ko benakaab karne vaali team ko inaam to dur ek adad puraskaar bhi nahin mila
 Found only a greeting letter from then Additional Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti in Crime Branch
 ab kashmir kii duruh paristhitiyon main se faraar qaatil ko khoj nikaalane or bina kisi gadabadi ke use pakadakar waapas salaakhon ke peeche bhejne vaali team kii tarif to khub ho rahi he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself has tweeted and tweeted
 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? It is learned that Sajjad has three more brothers

 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? The team returned from Jammu itself and came to Mumbai and continued the search through the source made in Jammu
 is bich asipi abhaya shastri apane divijan main waapas laut gaye, police inspector mahesh taavade ko bhi ek hatyakand ke silsile main malad police thane main waapas aana padaa or sipaahi ajay ballaal bhi kisi vajah se team kaa hissaa nahin rahaa
 Only Inspector Sanjay Nikam left the team and the remaining 4 soldiers
 mumbai main rahakar bhi inspector sanjay nikam shant nahin baithe
 Social sites were searched on the Internet in the name of Sajjad's brothers
 kai dinon kii koshish ke baad unhen fasebuk par killer naam se ek pej mila
 On that page created by Sajjad's younger brother, there was also a photo of all 4 brothers together
 lekin photo main bhaaiyon ke peeche jo jagah dikh rahi thi wo sajaad ke gaanv se alag thi
 a careful look revealed that it is a place where some construction work like dam or tunnel is going on
 photo main chaaron bhaaiyon ko saath dekhakar itnaa to saaf ho gaya tha ki sajaad pakistan adhikrut kashmir main nahin bhaaga he, wo isi paar he or apane parivaar ke sampark main he
 a huge clue was found in the hands of the police
 lekin chunauti us jagah ko pahchaanane or vahaan jane kii thi
 With this vital clue, Inspector Nikam left for Srinagar with his team
 iske liye unhone apni dadhi badhaai, or pahanava bhi badal liya
 Staying there, he made some such sources which understood the Baramula area, and kept his life there
 unase baatcheet main pataa chalaa ki us ilaake main har koi nahin ja saktaa
 There are some sensitive areas where the TRP i
e
 Temporary Residence must be near any outside person to go
 uske liye ilaake main us shaks ko jaanane vaala bhi hona chahie
 The area is under the supervision of the army and if there is any doubt, it can shoot
 police team ke saamne dohari chunauti thi
 If they reveal their true identity, Raj was afraid to open up and if he hides his identity, then to eat the pill
 sutron ke mutabik is dauraan sorce banane or jaankaree jutaney ke liye use khub paise bhi kharch karne pade
 It is said that the people there like sweets but they do not get such sweets easily, so they had to work by offering them cans of sweets
 ab tak police team ke paas kaaphi jaankaree jamaa ho chuki thi
 It was also learned that the site seen behind the photo is the site of National Hydro Power on the Jhelum River where construction work is going on
 isse ye andaja lag gaya ki sajaad ho naa ho us jagah par hi mazdooree kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 But it was impossible to go there only on the basis of speculation
 baharhaal pataa chalaa he ki inspector nikam kisi tarah jugad lagaakar ek baar sajaad ke gaanv tak bhi pahunch gayi the
 But when it was received information that 20 to 25 houses belonged to the Mughal family of Sajjad and all gathered on one voice, so it was not appropriate to take any risk at all
 ye bhi pataa chalaa ki sajaad apane ghar me naa rahakar gaanv se 4 kilometre dur jabaad ilaake main apane chachaa sarif ke ghar aata jaataa rahata tha
 Doing something there was risky even from his village
 police team ek baar phir waapas mumbai aakar maukey kaa intjaar karne lagi
 The sweet source continued to work
 oktober ke pehle saptaah main khabar mili ki sonmarg main ek bade project ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he, vahaan takreeban dedh hajaar majdoor kaam karte hai
 Many boys from Salamabad also work at that site and live there
 matlab sajaad ke vahaan hone kii prabal sambhaavna thi
 After receiving the information, Inspector Sanjay Nikam left with his three soldiers
 mumbai se srinagar or vahaan se sonmarg
 Srinagar went by airplane, so there is no question of carrying gun and handcuffs
 aise ilaake main jahaan baat baat main patharav, police or sena par bhi hamalaa hone kii ashanka bani rahati hai vahaan 4 log wo bhi nihathe, kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 But Sajjad had to be apprehended, even without the help of the local police as the matter was feared to be leaked
 sthaneey libaas main team sidhe us site par naa jaakar pehle aasapaas ke gaanv main gai
 Having described himself as an officer of the telephone company, he has come to survey to set up a telephone tower
 aatank or garibi kii dohari maar jhel rahe logon ko aamadani kaa jariya dikhaa or wo uske liye jameen dene ko taiyaar ho gaye
 But the aim of the police was to reach those laborers
 lihaaja tower banane ke liye jaruri mazdooron ko laane kii shart jameen waalon ko hi di gai
 Who would refuse to see money coming? wo log sonmarg main jahaan nirmaan kaam chal rahaa tha vahiin ke kuch thekedaaron ko bula laaye
 They were asked for a quotation and a condition of being taken to the site to see the work of the workers
 thekedaar taiyaar ho gaya or thodi hi der main team un mazdooron ke bich main thi
 Sajid's name was written in the list of laborers of the contractor whom he met by coincidence
 police ko pehle se andeshaa tha ki apni pahchaan chupaane ke liye sajaad duusare naam kaa sahaara le saktaa he or sajid sajaad se miltaa julata he isliye police ne sajid ko dekhnaa chaha
 The police team did not take any time to identify him as soon as the contractor pointed at him
 lekin kisi ne koi hadabadi nahin kii naa hi apane chehre par sajaad ko khoj nikaalane kii khushi ko aane diya
 The team went back
 agle do din use vahaan se uthaane ke maukey kii talash hoti rahi
 But he did not come out of the construction site
 ab police ke saamne mazdooron ke bich me jaakar sajaad ko pakadaney ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 Standing the car about 100 meters away, while telling soldiers Daya Kamble and Sandeep Kamble to sit in the same place with the driver, Inspector Nikam went to Sajjad with just one soldier Sandeep Talekar
 sajaad jahaan kaam kar rahaa tha uske thik peeche bada gaddha tha or dar tha ki agar wo bhaagta he to gadde main gir saktaa he or agar aisa hua to baat bigadate der nahin lagegi or uske baad kya hoga kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa tha
 So Impactor Nikam first stood very close to Sajjad towards that pit, then pressed his hand with one hand and said, "sajjad you have to go with me
 " or uskaa haath chhod diya
 But by then the other soldier who went along, according to the plan, stood close to Sajjad from the other side
 inspector nikam ke mutabik unki aawaaj sunate hi sajaad jagah par hi jad gaya
 He did not understand who we are and what he wants
 We gestured to push forward with his body without holding his hand and brought him to the car while talking to him
 sabakuch itani shanti se ho gaya ki aasapaas kaam karne vaale majdoor bhi kuch samaj nahin paye
 Opening the door of the car, as soon as he was seated in the car, he recognized the soldier sitting inside Daya Kamble and came out of his mouth, "hey sir, you?" Daya Kamble is the soldier who was always present in the court to help Special Public Prosecutor Ujwal Nikam during the trial
 sajaad unhen acchhee tarah se pahachaanata tha or dayaa ne dadhi bhi nahin rakhi thi isliye dayaa kamble ko gaadi main hi baithne ko kaha gaya tha
 By the time Sajjad and someone spoke or acted, the other soldier had also sat next to him and the car had also left from there
 driver ke bagal kii seat par baithe inspector sanjay nikam ne peeche mudakar sajaad ko ek seb diya or bole "kha"
 It did not take long to recognize Sajjad and he spoke up, Mr
 Nikam, are you? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he
 If not today then he will be caught tomorrow
 phir wo seemaa paar kyon nahin bhaag gaya? inspector sanjay nikam ke mutabik ye sawaal unhone bhi usase poocha tha
 Then Sajjad's answer was, Sir, there is no life beyond that
 garibi, bekaari or jillat ke sivaa vahaan kuch nahin he isaliye main yaheen rahakar jeena chaah rahaa tha
 The story after this is obvious
 sajaad kii giraftaar kitni ahm thi iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud mumbai police ayukta dattatreya padsalgikar ne patrkaar parishad laker uski giraftaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 He told that as soon as i got the information about the arrest of Sajjad, i first called Pallavi's father Purkayastha and told him that my eyes were filled with tears
 wo bole mujhe isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 The Commissioner of Police introduced the entire team to journalists
 tippaniyan Sanjay Nikam, who is a wrestler from Kadakathi, has also been among the frontrunners in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 us samay wo property cell main the
 In 2008, the property cell broke the back of terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen by holding the Pune module of Indian Mujahideen
 tab arun chavaan property cell ke incharge the or shripad kaale, nandkumar gopaale, sanjay nikam or ajay saavant us team ke ahm hissaa the
 It was a big setback for the Indian Mujahideen who had been puzzle till that time
 uske baad ahmedabad or karnataka main bhi badi sankhya main uske aatanki pakade gaye
 At that time, the late RR Patil was the Home Minister of the state and promised a reward of Rs 5 lakh
 lekin baad main 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad unhone istipha diya or wo vaada sirf ghoshnaa banakar rah gaya
 Surprisingly, the team that exposed the organization that carried out the terrorist incidents in the country from 2000 to 2008 did not even get a single award
 mila he to sirf krime branch main tab ke atirikt police ayukta deven bharti kaa ek abhinandan patr
 Now the team sending the absconding killer from the difficult circumstances of Kashmir and holding him back without any disturbance is praised
 khud mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne twit kar shaabaashi di he
 But the question is, will they get reward and reward on their bravery, dedication and success or will it remain a mere verbal exercise like the year 2008? is ahm suraag ke saath inspector nikam apni team ke saath ab srinagar ke liye nikal gayi
 For this, he grew his beard, and also changed his dress
 vahaan rahakar unhone kuch aise sorce banaaye jo baraamula ilaake ko samajhate the, vahaan jaan pahchaan rakhte the
 In conversation with him, it was found that not everyone can go to that area
 vahaan kuch aise samvedansheel ilaake hai jahaan jane ke liye kisi bhi bahari shaks ke paas tiarapy yani temporary racidence paas hona chahie
 He should also know that person in the area
 wo ilaaka sena kii nigaraanee main he or jaraa bhi shaq hone par wo goli maar sakati he
 The police team had a double challenge
 agar wo apni asli pahchaan jaahir karte hai to raaj khulne kaa dar tha or pahchaan chhupate hai to goli khaane kaa
 According to sources, during this time, he had to spend a lot of money to build sources and gather information
 bataate hai ki vahaan ke logon ko mithai pasand he lekin vahaan is tarah kii mithai aasaani se nahin milti isliye unhen mithai ke dibbe bhent kar kaam nikaalnaa padaa
 By now, a lot of information had been gathered with the police team
 ye bhi pataa chal chukaa tha ki photo main peeche dikh rahi jagah jhelum nadi par neshnal hydro power kii site hai jahaan nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 From this, it was guessed that Sajjad should not be working at that place
 lekin sirf andaaje par hi vahaan jane kaa jokhim nahin liya ja saktaa tha
 However, it has been learned that Inspector Nikam somehow reached the village of Sajjad once after putting a jugaad
 lekin jab ye jaankaree mili ki vahaan 20 se 25 ghar sajaad ke mughal parivaar ke hi hai or ek aawaaj par sabhi jamaa ho jate hai isaliye vahaan jaraa bhi jokhim mol lenaa munasib nahin tha
 It was also learned that Sajjad, instead of staying in his house, used to keep coming to his uncle Sarif's house in Jabar area, 4 km from the village
 vahaan kuch karnaa uske gaanv se bhi jokhim bharaa tha
 The police team once again came back to Mumbai and waited for the opportunity
 mithai vaale sorce kaam me lage rahe
 In the first week of October, it was reported that the work of construction of a large project is going on in Sonamarg, about one and a half thousand workers work there
 salamabad se bhi kai ladke us site par mazdooree karte hai or vahiin rahete hai
 Meaning Sajjad had a strong possibility of being there
 soochna milane ke baad inspector sanjay nikam apane teen sipaahiyon ke saath nikal gaye
 Srinagar to Mumbai and from there to Sonmarg
 srinagar hawaii jahaaj se gayi the isaliye bandook or hathkadi le jane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 In such an area where there is possibility of attack on stone pelting, police and army also, there could be 4 people unarmed, anything could happen
 lekin sajaad ko pakadana tha wo bhi bina sthaneey police kii sahaayta liye kyonki baat li hone kaa dar tha
 In the local veneer, the team did not go directly to that site and went to the surrounding village first
 khud ko telephone company kaa afasar bataakar telephone tower lagane ke liye survey karne aayaa he bataaya
 People who were facing the double whammy of terror and poverty showed a source of income and they agreed to give land for it
 lekin police kaa lakshya to un mazdooron tak pahunchnaa tha
 Therefore, the condition of bringing the necessary laborers to build the tower was given to the land owners
 paisa aata dekh bhala koun manaa karegaa
 Those people called some contractors from where the construction work was going on in Sonmarg
 unase kotesan maanga gaya or mazdooron ke kaam dekhne ke liye us site par le jane kii shart rakhi gai
 The contractor was ready and within a short time the team was among those workers
 ittefaq se jis thekedaar se mulaakaat hui thi uske mazdooron kii list main sajid naam likhaa tha
 The police had foreseen that Sajjad might resort to another name to hide his identity and that Sajid was similar to Sajjad, so the police wanted to see Sajid
 thekedaar kaa uski taraf ishaara karte hi police team ko use pahchaanane main der nahin lagi
 But no one hurried nor let the joy of finding Sajjad come on his face
 team waapas chali gai
 The next two days kept looking for a chance to pick him up
 lekin wo construction site se baahar nahin aayaa
 Now the police had no choice but to go and capture Sajjad among the workers
 takreeban 100 meter dur gaadi khadi kar sipaahi dayaa kamble or sandip kamble ko driver ke saath usee main baithe rahane ko kahkar impector nikam sirf ek sipaahi sandip talekar ke saath sajaad ke paas gaye
 There was a big pit just behind Sajjad where he was working and was afraid that if he runs away he might fall into the pit and if this happens then the matter will not be delayed and nothing will be said after that
 isliye impsector nikam pehle us gadde kii taraf sajaad ke bilkul kareeb khadey hue phir ek haath se uske haath ko dabaaya or bole, "sajaad tuje mere saath chalanaa he
 "and released his hand
 lekin tab tak saath main gaya doosraa sipaahi tay yojana ke mutabik duusari taraf se sajaad se satakar khadaa ho gaya
 According to Inspector Nikam, Sajjad took root at the place as soon as he heard his voice
 use kuch samaj hi nahin aayaa ki ham koun hai or kya chaahate hai? hamane uskaa haath bina pakade hi sharir se dhakka dekar aage chalane kaa ishaara kiya or usase saamaanya baat karte karte gaadi ke paas laaye
 Everything happened so peacefully that even the laborers working nearby could not understand anything
 gaadi kaa darwaja kholkar jaise hi use gaadi main bithaaya gaya andar baithe sipaahi dayaa kamble ko dekh kar wo pahchaan gaya or uske munh se aawaaj nikali "are sahab aap?" dayaa kamble wo sipaahi hai jo mukademe ke dauraan vishesh sarkari vakil ujwal nikam kii madad ke liye hameshaa adaalat main maujuud rahete the
 Sajjad knew him well and Daya did not even have a beard so Daya Kamble was asked to sit in the car
 sajaad or kuch bolta yaa harakat karata tab tak doosraa sipaahi bhi uske bagal main baith chukaa tha or gaadi bhi vahaan se nikal chuki thi
 The inspector Sanjay Nikam, sitting on the seat next to the driver, turned back and gave Sajjad an apple and said "eat"
 sajaad ko pahachaanate der nahin lagi or bol uthaa nikam sahab aap hai? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him
 tab sajaad kaa jawaab tha, sahab us paar jindagi nahin he
 There is nothing but poverty, unemployment and livelihood, so i wanted to live here
 iske baad kii kahani to jag jaahir he
 How important Sajjad's arrest was can be gauged from the fact that Mumbai Police Commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar himself announced his arrest
 unhone bataaya ki jaise hi mujhe sajaad kii giraftaar kii soochna mili maine sabase pehle pallavi ke pita purkysth ko phone kar bataaya to unki aankh main aasuun aa gaye
 He said that i was waiting for this moment
 police ayukta ne puri team kaa parichay patrakaron se karaayaa
 The comments kadalathi se pahalwaan lagane vaale inspector sanjay nikam 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main bhi morcha sanbhaalane waalon main rahe hai
 He was in the property cell at that time
 property cell ne hi saal 2008 main indian mujahidin ke pune modul ko pakad kar aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin kii qamar todi thi
 Then Arun Chavan was in charge of the property cell and Shripad Kale, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Nikam and Ajay Sawant were important part of that team
 uske pehle tak paheli rahe indian mujahidin ke liye wo bada jhatka tha
 a large number of his terrorists were also caught in Ahmedabad and Karnataka after that
 us samay divangat aar aar patil rajya ke grahamantri the unhone 5 lakh rupee inaam dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But later he resigned after the 26 / 11 terror attack and that promise was just a declaration
 hairaani kii baat he ki saal 2000 se 2008 tak desh main aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaale sanghathan ko benakaab karne vaali team ko inaam to dur ek adad puraskaar bhi nahin mila
 Found only a greeting letter from then Additional Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti in Crime Branch
 ab kashmir kii duruh paristhitiyon main se faraar qaatil ko khoj nikaalane or bina kisi gadabadi ke use pakadakar waapas salaakhon ke peeche bhejne vaali team kii tarif to khub ho rahi he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself has tweeted and tweeted
 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? The area is under the supervision of the army and if there is any doubt, it can shoot
 police team ke saamne dohari chunauti thi
 If they reveal their true identity, Raj was afraid to open up and if he hides his identity, then to eat the pill

 thekedaar taiyaar ho gaya or thodi hi der main team un mazdooron ke bich main thi
 Sajid's name was written in the list of laborers of the contractor whom he met by coincidence
 police ko pehle se andeshaa tha ki apni pahchaan chupaane ke liye sajaad duusare naam kaa sahaara le saktaa he or sajid sajaad se miltaa julata he isliye police ne sajid ko dekhnaa chaha
 The police team did not take any time to identify him as soon as the contractor pointed at him
 lekin kisi ne koi hadabadi nahin kii naa hi apane chehre par sajaad ko khoj nikaalane kii khushi ko aane diya
 The team went back
 agle do din use vahaan se uthaane ke maukey kii talash hoti rahi
 But he did not come out of the construction site
 ab police ke saamne mazdooron ke bich me jaakar sajaad ko pakadaney ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 Standing the car about 100 meters away, while telling soldiers Daya Kamble and Sandeep Kamble to sit in the same place with the driver, Inspector Nikam went to Sajjad with just one soldier Sandeep Talekar
 sajaad jahaan kaam kar rahaa tha uske thik peeche bada gaddha tha or dar tha ki agar wo bhaagta he to gadde main gir saktaa he or agar aisa hua to baat bigadate der nahin lagegi or uske baad kya hoga kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa tha
 So Impactor Nikam first stood very close to Sajjad towards that pit, then pressed his hand with one hand and said, "sajjad you have to go with me
 " or uskaa haath chhod diya
 But by then the other soldier who went along, according to the plan, stood close to Sajjad from the other side
 inspector nikam ke mutabik unki aawaaj sunate hi sajaad jagah par hi jad gaya
 He did not understand who we are and what he wants
 We gestured to push forward with his body without holding his hand and brought him to the car while talking to him
 sabakuch itani shanti se ho gaya ki aasapaas kaam karne vaale majdoor bhi kuch samaj nahin paye
 Opening the door of the car, as soon as he was seated in the car, he recognized the soldier sitting inside Daya Kamble and came out of his mouth, "hey sir, you?" Daya Kamble is the soldier who was always present in the court to help Special Public Prosecutor Ujwal Nikam during the trial
 sajaad unhen acchhee tarah se pahachaanata tha or dayaa ne dadhi bhi nahin rakhi thi isliye dayaa kamble ko gaadi main hi baithne ko kaha gaya tha
 By the time Sajjad and someone spoke or acted, the other soldier had also sat next to him and the car had also left from there
 driver ke bagal kii seat par baithe inspector sanjay nikam ne peeche mudakar sajaad ko ek seb diya or bole "kha"
 It did not take long to recognize Sajjad and he spoke up, Mr
 Nikam, are you? sawaal he ki sajaad mughal ko pataa tha ki police uski talash main he
 If not today then he will be caught tomorrow
 phir wo seemaa paar kyon nahin bhaag gaya? inspector sanjay nikam ke mutabik ye sawaal unhone bhi usase poocha tha
 Then Sajjad's answer was, Sir, there is no life beyond that
 garibi, bekaari or jillat ke sivaa vahaan kuch nahin he isaliye main yaheen rahakar jeena chaah rahaa tha
 The story after this is obvious
 sajaad kii giraftaar kitni ahm thi iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki khud mumbai police ayukta dattatreya padsalgikar ne patrkaar parishad laker uski giraftaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 He told that as soon as i got the information about the arrest of Sajjad, i first called Pallavi's father Purkayastha and told him that my eyes were filled with tears
 wo bole mujhe isi pal kaa intjaar tha
 The Commissioner of Police introduced the entire team to journalists
 tippaniyan Sanjay Nikam, who is a wrestler from Kadakathi, has also been among the frontrunners in the 26 / 11 terror attack
 us samay wo property cell main the
 In 2008, the property cell broke the back of terrorist organization Indian Mujahideen by holding the Pune module of Indian Mujahideen
 tab arun chavaan property cell ke incharge the or shripad kaale, nandkumar gopaale, sanjay nikam or ajay saavant us team ke ahm hissaa the
 It was a big setback for the Indian Mujahideen who had been puzzle till that time
 uske baad ahmedabad or karnataka main bhi badi sankhya main uske aatanki pakade gaye
 At that time, the late RR Patil was the Home Minister of the state and promised a reward of Rs 5 lakh
 lekin baad main 26 / 11 aatanki hamale ke baad unhone istipha diya or wo vaada sirf ghoshnaa banakar rah gaya
 Surprisingly, the team that exposed the organization that carried out the terrorist incidents in the country from 2000 to 2008 did not even get a single award
 mila he to sirf krime branch main tab ke atirikt police ayukta deven bharti kaa ek abhinandan patr
 Now the team sending the absconding killer from the difficult circumstances of Kashmir and holding him back without any disturbance is praised
 khud mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne twit kar shaabaashi di he
 But the question is, will they get reward and reward on their bravery, dedication and success or will it remain a mere verbal exercise like the year 2008? oktober ke pehle saptaah main khabar mili ki sonmarg main ek bade project ke nirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he, vahaan takreeban dedh hajaar majdoor kaam karte hai
 Many boys from Salamabad also work at that site and live there
 matlab sajaad ke vahaan hone kii prabal sambhaavna thi
 After receiving the information, Inspector Sanjay Nikam left with his three soldiers
 mumbai se srinagar or vahaan se sonmarg
 Srinagar went by airplane, so there is no question of carrying gun and handcuffs
 aise ilaake main jahaan baat baat main patharav, police or sena par bhi hamalaa hone kii ashanka bani rahati hai vahaan 4 log wo bhi nihathe, kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 But Sajjad had to be apprehended, even without the help of the local police as the matter was feared to be leaked
 sthaneey libaas main team sidhe us site par naa jaakar pehle aasapaas ke gaanv main gai
 Having described himself as an officer of the telephone company, he has come to survey to set up a telephone tower

 The inspector Sanjay Nikam, sitting on the seat next to the driver, turned back and gave Sajjad an apple and said "eat"
 sajaad ko pahachaanate der nahin lagi or bol uthaa nikam sahab aap hai? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him
 tab sajaad kaa jawaab tha, sahab us paar jindagi nahin he
 There is nothing but poverty, unemployment and livelihood, so i wanted to live here
 iske baad kii kahani to jag jaahir he
 How important Sajjad's arrest was can be gauged from the fact that Mumbai Police Commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar himself announced his arrest
 unhone bataaya ki jaise hi mujhe sajaad kii giraftaar kii soochna mili maine sabase pehle pallavi ke pita purkysth ko phone kar bataaya to unki aankh main aasuun aa gaye
 He said that i was waiting for this moment
 police ayukta ne puri team kaa parichay patrakaron se karaayaa
 The comments kadalathi se pahalwaan lagane vaale inspector sanjay nikam 26 / 11 aatanki hamale main bhi morcha sanbhaalane waalon main rahe hai
 He was in the property cell at that time
 property cell ne hi saal 2008 main indian mujahidin ke pune modul ko pakad kar aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin kii qamar todi thi
 Then Arun Chavan was in charge of the property cell and Shripad Kale, Nandkumar Gopale, Sanjay Nikam and Ajay Sawant were important part of that team
 uske pehle tak paheli rahe indian mujahidin ke liye wo bada jhatka tha
 a large number of his terrorists were also caught in Ahmedabad and Karnataka after that
 us samay divangat aar aar patil rajya ke grahamantri the unhone 5 lakh rupee inaam dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But later he resigned after the 26 / 11 terror attack and that promise was just a declaration
 hairaani kii baat he ki saal 2000 se 2008 tak desh main aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam dene vaale sanghathan ko benakaab karne vaali team ko inaam to dur ek adad puraskaar bhi nahin mila
 Found only a greeting letter from then Additional Commissioner of Police Deven Bharti in Crime Branch
 ab kashmir kii duruh paristhitiyon main se faraar qaatil ko khoj nikaalane or bina kisi gadabadi ke use pakadakar waapas salaakhon ke peeche bhejne vaali team kii tarif to khub ho rahi he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis himself has tweeted and tweeted
 lekin sawaal he kya inhen inaki bahaduree, samarpan or safalataa par inaam or puraskaar milegaa yaa phir saal 2008 kii tarah sirf jubaani kavayad ban kar rah jaayegi? The question is whether Sajjad Mughal knew that the police were looking for him
 aaj nahin to kal wo pakadaa hi jaayegaa
 Then why did he not run across the border? According to Inspector Sanjay Nikam, he also asked this question to him

 com / 1s8yt0ni7b — Office of RG (@officeofrg) December 5, 2017 What was Rahul's old tweet? Rahul tweeted the 7th question to PM Modi, wrote, 'jumlal infidelity kills, demonetisation kills, GST kills all earnings She left, inflation was killed if anything else was left
 badhate daamon se jeena dushwaar bas amiron kii hogi bhaajapa sarkaar?'rahul ne apane twit main kuch aankadon kaa bhi zikr kiya he jo desh main badhati mahangaai kii ore ishaara kar rahe hai
 It has been told that between 2014 and 17, the prices of items like gas cylinders, lentils, onions, milk, diesel, tomatoes have increased more than double

 com / fmg4pm4z2s— Office of RG (@officeofrg)december 5, 2017modi ko gherne kii ranneetigujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ke bich congress ne ranneeti banaai he ki rahul gandhi roj pradhanmantri modi se ek sawaal puuchhenge
 In his first question, Rahun raised the promise of providing housing in Gujarat, in the second the issue of debt on the Gujarat government and in the third the issue of power supply
 iske baad rahul ne rajya main shiksha vyavastha or gujarat main mahila suraksha, swasthya kaa mudda uthaate hue pradhanmantri modi ko nishane par liya tha
 These are 6 questions so far
 
 
 vetan ayog pagaar par daaga tha sawalrahul gandhi abhi tak kul chha: sawaal puch chuke hai
 Asking the sixth question, the Pay Commission questioned the salary
 rahul ne apane twit main poocha ki ''bhaajapa kii dohari maar ek taraf yuva berozegaar duusari taraf lakhon fiks pagaar or kontract karmchaaree bezaar 7wein vetan ayog main ₹18000 masik hone ke baavjood fiks or kontract pagaar ₹5500 or ₹1 xxrep 4 0 kyon? 'mahila suraksha ko lekar poocha tha prashn (paanchavaa sawaal)rahul ne ravivaar ko twitor par 5waan sawaal karte hue gujarat main mahilaon kii suraksha, shiksha or swasthya kaa maamla uthaaya tha
 Rahul had questioned the BJP, which held power in Gujarat for 22 years, questioning PM Modi
 rahul ne twit karte hue likhaa, 'na suraksha, na shiksha, na poshan, mahilaon ko mila to sirf shoshan, anganwari varkar or aashaa, sabko di bas niraashaa, gujarat kii bahanon se kiya sirf vaada, puraa karne kaa kabhi nahin tha iraadaa'
 With this question, Rahul has also written the answer to the hashtag Gujarat
 shiksha par maanga jawaab (chauthaa sawaal ) # gujarat_maange_javabake saath rahul gandhi ne subah apana chauthaa sawaal twit kiya
 In this tweet, he wrote with the title 'prime Minister- Fourth question', 'at the expense of government school-college, did business of education, hit every student with expensive fees, how will the dream of New India come true?' Tanja (third question) Rahul's third question is related to power supply in Gujarat
 rahul ne twit kar modi se poocha ki 2002-16 ke bich 62 hajaar 549 karod kii bijli kharid kar 4 nijee companiyon kii jeb kyon bhari? saath hirahul gandhi ne gujarat sarkaarper sarkari bijli kaarkaanon kii kshamta ghataane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rahul said that the capacity of the government power plants was reduced by 62 percent but why did he buy electricity from a private company for Rs 3 per unit for Rs 24? There was debt and in 2017, Gujarat has a debt of Rs 2,41,000 crore
 yani har gujarati par 37 hajaar rupee kaa karj he
 Keeping these figures in front, Rahul Gandhi has asked why the people of Gujarat should pay the sentence of Narendra Modi's financial mismanagement and publicity? Started from the house (first question) On November 29, Rahul started his questions
 congress upaadhyaksh ne twit karte hue pehla sawaal poocha, '22 saalon kaa hisaab, gujarat maange jawaab, gujarat ke halaat par pradhanmantriji se pehla sawaal: 2012 main vaada kiya ki 50 lakh nae ghar denge, 5 saal main banaae 4
 72 lakh houses
 pradhanmantriji bataaie ki kya ye vaada puraa hone main 45 saal or lagenge'
 Rahul Gandhi is reminiscent of the election promises made by the BJP in the last election

 After the embarrassing defeat of 180 runs against Pakistan, Team India captain Virat Kohli praised Pakistan, but Kumble took a tough class after the match
 khabaron ke mutabik anil kumble ne team ke kai khilaadiyon ko khub daant lagaai or kaha ki har kisi kaa khel final main ummid se kam str kaa tha
 It is believed that this became the final reason for Kumble's departure
 aaie jaanate hai ki hua kya
 
 
 Kumble was further infuriated that there was absolutely no grief on the players' faces after the match and he was joking with the Pakistan players on the field
 anil kumble ne dressing room main team ke gendbaajon kii khub class lagaai or unhen kaha ki team main bane rahane ke liye aisa pradarshan kaam nahin aayega
 Kumble's bitter words were not liked by captain Virat Kohli, because Kohli believed that the players had done the effort but that day Pakistan's team was better in every respect
 par kumble kohli kii is daleel ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 The comments bas phir kya tha? is jhagade ne kohli-kumble vivaad main taabut main aakhri keel kaa kaam kiya
 The next day when Kumble met BCCI officials, Kumble was made clear that Kohli no longer wanted him as the coach of the team
 kumble ne usee samay team ke coach pad se istipha dene kaa man bana liya
 Anil Kumble has said in the tweet about the possibility of not improving relations with captain Virat Kohli after leaving the coach's post
 kubanle ne likhaa, 'mujhe bataaya gaya ki captain ko meri kaaryastylee ko lekar pareshaani he
 i was surprised to know this because i know the boundaries of captain and coach very well
 haalanki bisisiai ne mere or captain ke bich sulah karaane kii koshish kii

 But Kumble was not ready to accept Kohli's argument
 tippaniyan Just what then? The feud served as the last nail in the coffin in the kohli-kumble dispute
 agle din kumble jab bisisiai ke adhikariyon se mili to kumble ko ye saaf kar diya gaya ki kohli unhen ab team kaa coach nahin chaahate
 At the same time, Kumble made up his mind to resign as the coach of the team

 At the same time, administration in the states was also tight

 Social media has created a stir over an alleged statement by BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat of Madhya Pradesh
 ek viral post ke mutabik sadhvi pragna ne kaha ki agar bijepi satta main aati he, to goa, uttar-purv or dakshin bharat main puri tarah se gomance par pratibandh laga diya jayega
 In this viral post further, Sadhvi Pragya was also quoted as saying that former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar died of cancer because he was allowed to consume beef in Goa and did not respect the cow
 india today anti phek news room (AFWA) ko apni padtaal main saarvajanik rup se aisa koi bhi bayaan nahin mila, jisamen sadhvi ne aisa kaha ho
 Many people have shared this post including the Facebook page 'news Today channel'
 twitor par bhi yah post viral ho rahaa he
 Pragya Thakur: "parrikar (ex CM of GOA) died of cancer because he allowed the consumption of beef in Goa"
 The consumption of cow urine cured my of breast cancer
 Parrikar died because he did not respect Gau Mata
 😩🙏😩https: / / t
 co / fcx5yglt6t— ☭ Comrade ☭ Of FEKOSLOVAKIA (@comrade_ind) April 30, 2019 We thoroughly searched the internet, but we did not find any mention of this statement of Sadhvi Pragya in any reliable news report
 agar sadhvi ne saarvajanik rup se is tarah kaa koi vivaadit bayaan diya hota, to vah media or bhaajapa ke pratidwandviyon dwaara jarur uthaaya jaataa
 In connection with this statement, we got an article from a website called 'indiascoops'
 26 april ko is website ne ek lekh chapa tha, jiskaa sheershak he -'will Totally Ban Beef in States like Goa, north-east, If BJP Comes to Power at the Centre: Sadhvi Pragya
 '(if BJP comes to power, beef will be banned completely in Goa, north-east and South India)
 is lekh ke anusaar sadhvi pragna ne ye bayaan madhya pradesh ke sihor main diya tha
 It was also mentioned in the article that Sadhvi Pragya made this statement not in media or public meeting, but in front of some followers
 india today ne is bare main jaanane ke liye sadhvi pragna kii bahan upama singh se sampark kiya
 Upma told us that this statement is absolutely false and Sadhvi Pragya never made such a statement
 haal hi main unhone mumbai aties ke purv pramukh hemanth karkare par vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 He said that Hemant Karkare died because he cursed Hemant
 haalanki jab is bayaan ko lekar vivaad machaa, to sadhvi pragna ne maafi maang lee thi

 baraak obama main ek sanskari khandaani ladke ke saare lakshan hai
 Sanskars are the reason why they are greeted as soon as they come, they are very high, all the aunts of the locality can call again and again to change the bulbs and clean the fans
 teen divasiy daure ke aakhri dinabaraak obamamericom ko bhi yaad kar rahe the or ‘dilavaale dulhaniya le jaayenge’ kaa samvaad bolte najar aae,matlab ladke kaa khilne-kudane main man lagata he or filmi bate kar jaahir kar diya ki hansod bhi he, jati-umr kaa bandhan or bagal main mishael na hoti to mohalle kii aantiyaan ekaadh darjan ladakiyon ke photo dekar hi unhen chhodti
 Well Obama went but left Shahrukh Khan happy, Dilwale
 
 With a dialogue of, the Maratha temple has been arranged for the next five hundred weeks
 wo to shukr manaaie shahrukh kii ‘dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge’ kii bajaay ‘happy new year’ kaa dialog nahi bolaa varanaa modi vidaai main ek sau ikyavan vaala lipapha bhi na dete
 After a dialogue by Dilwale Dulhania, we have done a lot of searching and searching that evergreen dialogues of Hindi films that Obama can speak
 mere bare main zyada mat sochna-haa bhai kii 'kik' kaa ye samvaad obama navaj sharif se bolte najar aa sakate hai
 While saying yes to visit India, he turned down the invitation of Pakistan, so Nawaz Sharif don't think much about me, i come to India and not Pakistan
 rishte main to ham tumhaare baap lagate hai –antarrashtriya bazaar main jeebh laplapate dragon ko baraak obama kii ye naseehat bade kaam aa sakati he,yahan ham kaa matlab america yaa obama nahi balki do mahashaktiyaan hai bharat or america jo saath baithkar chaay bhi pien to dard china ke akhabaaron main najar aata he
 My name is Barack - Barack Obama's name is also not short of 'hussain' infiltrators, and while speaking on the last day in India, he also indicated that those who do not know him question his faith for this reason, He belongs to any religion and this is not wrong, so do not hesitate to repeat this dialogue of Obama Shahrukh
 aaj ke baad meri beti ke aasapaas bhi najar aae to mujhase bura koi nahi hoga- baraak obama hindi filmon ke paapaaon kaa pasandida dialog america media se bolte najar aaenge,jo pichley kuch samay se obama kii badi beti ke garbhvatee hone kii afvaahen uda rahe hai
 Today there is not so much in the mind, as much as we used to leave, in the scale - whose lion is there, who does not know, but the dialogue spoken in the drunken film was fitting on Barack Obama in the past, who knows Obama well
 That he had been a drug addict at one time, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol were common for him, i wish we had known how many times Obama had repeated these conversations alone on Dry Day
 bhai main tuje kuch hone nahi duungaa-obama kii ore se ye dialog un sabhi ke liye jinhone obama healthcare polisy le rakhi he׀jinke ghar shishe ke hote hai wo dusron ke ghar par pathar nahin uchhaala karte- america company ne ‘da intervyuu’ banaai,north korea ne soni kii websit par havers ke jariye hamalaa kiya,badale main america ne unki internet vyavastha thapp kar di,rajkumaar sahab ke is dialog ke liye isse behatar sichuation kya ho sakati he?
