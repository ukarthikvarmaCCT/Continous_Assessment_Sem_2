 Masood Azhar writes columns every week in the Jaish newspaper
 yah akhbaar pakistan ke peshawar se chhapata he
 Now remember the statement of Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, which he recently gave in an interview of American news channel
 kuraishi ne masood ko bahut biimaar bataaya tha
 When the Imran government felt that it could not go wrong with the confession of Masood at his disposal, the army said that Jaish Mohammad does not exist in Pakistan, but the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Taking a slap in the face of both the government, Masood himself said that he is in Pakistan and is fit
 isi se sabit hota he ki pakistan main aatankiyon kii kya haisiyat he
 China has become the shield of terrorist, the whole world is angry, despite Hafiz Saeed being declared a global terrorist, he has got all kinds of leeway in Pakistan
 usase ye sawaal bhi uthne lage hai ki masood par global aatanki kaa tag chaspa ho bhi jaae to kya hoga

 Are Indian men still as sensitive about their virginity of virginity as they used to be a decade ago? Or put it this way that if Actress Khushboo reiterates her 2005 statement, "no educated man would want his wife to be a virgin", then will shoes and eggs be thrown at him, he will be courted
 Will be dragged into, and forced to make a public apology on TV? The India Today group-mdra Sex Survey, 2013 indicates that the trend of men is the same even today
 survey bataata he ki vivaah purv sex kar chuke purushon kaa anupaat mahilaon ke mukaable teen guna he, phir bhi kam-se-kam 77 fisadi purush ab bhi ‘‘virgin dulhan’’ par hi jor dete hai
 This is surprising because a huge change is seen in the ways of man-to-man interaction
 bees saal pehle adhikansh log khulkar apane ‘‘boyfriend’’ or ‘‘garlfriend’’ hone kii baat sweekaar nahin karte the
 However, now the thinking about dating has changed and people have become soft on it
 1980 ke dashak tak agar kisi filmi sitare kaa kisi ke saath romance chalata tha to vah stardst kii chatpati gapshap se hi pataa chalata tha
 Today, the stars talk openly about who they are dating, who they have had a breakup with, or who they are living in a live-in relationship with
 sex survey main vivaah purv sex kii baat swikaarne vaale stri or purushon ke pratishat main fark bhi uljhane vaala he
 If there are three times the number of men than women in the case of premarital sex, then most of these men will either go to brothels or there will be more number of women with more than one partner
 zyada sambhaavna yahi he ki saamaajik varjanaaon kii vajah se mahilaayein vivaah purv sex kii baat sweekaar karne main hichak rahi hon
 Hymenoplasty demand has increased in the country in the last decade
 kai baar halke-phulke shabdon main ise ‘‘punah comarya’’ praapt karnaa kehete hai
 It is a surgery to repair the virgin membrane
 dilli ke apollo aspataal main cosmetic sarjan anup dheer kehete hai ki har saal himanoplasty kii maang 20-30 fisadi kii dar se bad rahi he
 Since it has around Rs 1 lakh
 kaa kharch aata he isliye yah madhya or ucch madhya varg kaa hi shagal ho saktaa he
 Anita Kant, head of Obstetrics at the Asian Institute of Medical Sciences in Faridabad, says, "many girls believe that no matter how modern their partners are, the male mentality is conservative
" ’’duusare shabdon main bhartiya samaaj main sex ko lekar ek had tak udaartaa dikhne ke baavjood mahilaon se judi sex sambandhi puraani rudhipoon main khaas badlaav najar nahin aata he
 But it is certain that the "lost" virginity cannot be regained by the repair of the hymen? Wouldn't educated men know about this surgery? What will happen if they come to know this later? In such a situation, if the couple talks openly about this, can not money, time and anxiety be avoided? According to the survey, 77 percent of men say that if a girl tells about their premarital sex then they will not marry her
 haalanki tathy yah bhi he ki chaahe himan ko durust kiya gaya ho yaa nahin, is baat kaa koi sanket nahin mil saktaa ki kisi aurat ne shaareerik sambandh banaae hai yaa nahin
 Often the hymen is "ripped off" by taking part in a sport that involves more setbacks and hard work, such as cycling
 or aam manyata ke vipareet ‘‘nath utaarne’’ jaisaa koi aayojan nahin hota
 Online sex education website Skarltein has named Hymen as "the outer covering of the vagina", according to which the hymen is a very fine membrane that partially covers the vagina (does not completely close), hence the male infertility
 During the course it is not really "shattering, bursting, shattering"
 iske vipareet yah halki-si fat jaati he or baad main apane aap hi durust bhi ho jaati he
 In many girls, the hymen is quite flexible and slides to one side during intercourse
 yahi vajah he ki sex ke maamle main sakriy rahane vaali kai mahilaon kii hin par koi fark nahin padataa or vah apni jagah barkaraar rahati he
 Despite these facts, men remain highly sensitive to "virgin" women in almost all societies and cultures
 or iske liye ve koi bhi keemat chukaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 In 2012, 22-year-old college student Natalie Dylan auctioned her virginity on the net
 use apane tution ke liye paise kii jarurat thi
 The auction bid reached $ 3
7 million
 mahilaon kii virginity ko lekar is purush maansikta ko kaise samajha ja saktaa he? kuch kii daleel he ki kisi purush ke liye yah aashwast hone kaa paaramparik tarika he ki uski dulhan pehle kisi or ke bachche kii maa nahin bani he
 But what is it today? Hugo, a writer and professor of gender studies, "relates the male mentality about visor virginity to" anxiety about masculine strength "and" fear of competition "
 yani isaki jad main purushon ko sex ko lekar asuraksha he
 If he can reach where no man has reached before, he will not worry about how his masculine strength will be compared to others! This insecurity is hidden in the mantle of social beliefs
 kaam sutara pita ko salaah detaa he ki apane beton kaa vivaah virgin ladakiyon se karen to unhen ‘‘samaajik pratishtha’’ hasil hogi
 It is also interesting to note that historically the wish of the virgin bride has been in the middle and upper middle class, and this is not only in India
 apane jivan ke adhikansh samay apni privesi ko bachaae rakhane main vyast raheen rajkumaari dyna ko vivaah ke dauraan bahucharchit virginity test se guzarana padaa tha, or uske nateezon kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa kar unke ankal ne gauravanvit mahasoos kiya tha
 In the Victoria era, British upper class couples could not show the courage to do more than carriage rides, touches or kisses, while in 1800, about one-third of the working class women in England were found pregnant on the wedding day! In a mass marriage organized to help the poor and tribal families of the state government in the state, 450 bridegrooms had to undergo virginity and pregnancy test
 adhikari yah jaanakar hairaan the ki kuch dulahanen garbhvatee thim
 He was removed from the event
 stri comarya ko lekar bharat main sabase pracheen saanskrithik sandarbh kareeb 2000 saal pehle kii kitaab arthshaastra main miltaa he
 It has policies related to economy and administration
 isamen ladakiyon kii virginity bhang hone ke maamalon main vibhinn jati or varg ke liye alag-alag aarthik dand vidhaan hai
 For upper caste men, breach of virginity of a girl of their caste was a penalty of 400 rupees or a hand cut, whereas in the case of a maid daughter, it was a provision of giving 12 panas and clothes and jewelry
 virginity ko sirf aarthik mulya se hi nahin taula jaataa balki aisa vidhaan bhi he jisase ucch varg kii virginity ko ‘‘manhagi vastu’’ or tathakthith nichali jatiyon kii virginity ko ‘‘sasti vastu’’ ke rup main aanka jaataa he
 But in both cases it is "the object" itself
 is tarah mahilaon ko vibhinn brands or mulya kii vastu bana diya jaataa he
 This is the principle under which the male virgin procures the bride
 yah isse alag nahin he ki mahilaayein plastic yaa dhaatu kii sex tathaa baccha paidaa karne kii mashin hotin or dukaanon se kharid laai jaatin
 It is the same unfortunate thought that a brand new machine should be bought, whose seal is sealed
 second hand saamaan koun khareednaa chahega? or agar second hand maal hi khareednaa ho to saste main khareednaa chahega
 In many parts of India, where the male-female ratio has decreased so much that girls are not available to marry, there has been a practice of "bride smuggling"
 kai bhaaiyon vaala koi parivaar ‘‘dulhan’’ kharidta he jo sabhi bhaaiyon ke sex or baccha paidaa karne ke kaam aati he
 And when they feel that it has been used a lot, it is sold to some more needy family for something cheaper
 is tarah ek ‘‘dulhan’’ paanch-paanch baar tak bechi-kharidi ja sakati he
 Apart from this, there are some communities which traditionally depend on the prostitution of their daughters
 unke yahaan kisi ladki kii virginity bhang kaa utsav yaa ‘‘nath utraai’’ ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 In this event he is sold to the highest bidder
 or agar koi vastu kharid laate hai, to bhala koi yah kehane vaala koun hota he ki use kaise istemaal karo or kaise nahin?aashcharya nahin ki india today-emdiare survey main 80 fisadi purush maanate hai ki agar kisi stri se unhone shaadi kii he to usase sex karne kaa bhi unhen adhikaar he
 Or 80 percent say that even if they become impotent, their wives have no right to find another sex partner
 lekin antat stri ko sambhog or baccha paidaa karne kii vastu maanane kaa purushon kaa amanviya najariya sirf unke boote hi kaayam nahin he
 Traditional women also want to see themselves as that
 striyaan purushon kii virginity yaa sex sambandhi aakankshaon main feet hone kii chintaa main mari jaati hai avasarvadita, duschintaa kii shikaar hoti hai
 It has been 2000 years since the value of virginity of women was established in India
 ab ise chunauti dene kaa, badalane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 And this will only happen when the Indian woman learns to be the master of her body, her work and her own feelings

 The sound of an echo in the political plains of Uttar Pradesh is bound to reach Delhi
 yah pehla mauka he jab rajya vidhansabha ke chunaav main sirf partiyon kii nahin, vyaktiyon kii saakh bhi daanv par he, jinaki siyaasi hanak chunavi nattejey se tay honge
 For the bjp-congress and the Samajwadi Party, this election will be a test of generational change, while for Mayawati the challenge is to establish herself in central politics by repeating the charisma of 2007 to meet the expectations of the people
 04 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india toderajanatik vishleshak neeraja choudhary kahati hai, ''yah chunaav saadhaaran chunaavon ke mukaable behad mahatvapurn he
 The future of the main parties will be decided by this, because this time a new generation is in the field
 '' uttar pradesh samet paanch rajyon ke chunaavon kaa pehla asar april-may 2012 main hone vaale rajyasabha ke 58 siton or june-july main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav par padegaa
 Political experts believe that the election results of the country's largest state, Uttar Pradesh, will show the trend of general elections in 2014
 siyaasi dalon ko bhi iskaa bakhubi andaja he
 In an attempt to become a role model for the youth, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has put his credibility at stake
 philhal, raa'l kii koshish kaa asar hota dikh rahaa he, lekin log yah nahin bhuule hai ki bihar chunaav main unki mehnat jaaya ho gai thi
 The Congress has 22 mlas in the state and despite such hard work, if this figure does not reach a respectable level or from fourth to second-third position, then Rahul's stature is bound to be small
 28 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudechoudhary kahati hai, ''agar congress uttar pradesh, uttarakhand or punjab main satta main aati he, to dedh saal se bachaav kii mudra main rahane vaali party ko hamalavar hone kaa mauka milegaa or 2014 ke aam chunaav main rahul kii bhoomika badi hogi
 But in the event of defeat, Rahul's leadership will be questioned and the opposition will promote him as a failed leader
 '' tab janata main bhi unki lokapriyata kaa graph girnaa tay he
 In such a situation, the party may start preparing to bring Priyanka Gandhi as a trump card for the next assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah hi vidhansabha chunaav main bhi congress kaa paracham laharaata he to pradhanmantri pad kii daud main rahul ke saath shaamil vipakshi netaa kai furlongs peeche chhot jaaenge
 If the BJP has a heavy upper hand in the results, then the list of prime ministerial contenders in the party will get longer
 sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, narendra modi sareekhe netaaon ke saath nitin gadakari, rajnath singh bhi swaabhaavik daavedaar ke taur par ubharenge
 21 December 2011: See India Today in pictures, although former National President Rajnath Singh, who is playing the role of a decisive strategist in the state, does not agree with the plea that the defeat and victory of UP elections will affect the politics of the Center
 ve kehete hai, ''uttar pradesh chunaav kaa apana mahatv jarur he, lekin main isse sahamat nahin hum ki jiske sarvaadhik vidhayak jeetenge, vahi dilli kii satta par haaavee hoga
 "the Congress also has a similar argument
 sapa-basapa ke mukaable apni kamjor sthiti kii ghabrahat or dar bhaajapa-congress netaaon main saaf dikhti he
 Digvijay Singh, general secretary in-charge of the Congress in the state, says, "it is too early to say that the 2012 Uttar Pradesh elections will have an impact on the 2014 general election
" abhi lanbaa samay he or samay ke saath mudde or halaat badal jate hai
 "on the other hand, Mayawati can manage to save her survival in both the win-win situation, because she has her own separate vote bank
" vaise, haar kii sthiti main mayawati ke pradhanmantri kii kursi tak pahunchane kii manshaa par pani phirana tay he
 After being out of power, she will not be able to even plan to increase her political power by dividing the state into four parts
 mayawati apni khaas ranneeti ke tahat chunaav ko basapa banaam congress dikhaane kii koshish main hai
 14 December 2011: See in the pictures, India Today retorts every statement of Rahul
 lekin basapa ho yaa sapa donon ne rashtriya partiyon ke saath gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko khatm nahin kiya he
 Issues like the Lokpal Bill in Parliament or the proposal to cut inflation, the BSP-SP has not allowed its relations with the Congress to become very tense by adopting a walkout strategy
 isaki ek vajah yah bhi he ki upie sarkaar maaya or mulaayam ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamalon ko ankush ke rup main istemaal kar rahi he
 This election raises the question of survival for the SP
 kai varshon se satta se dur party ke liye soobe kii siyasat main apni ahmiyat banaae rakhane kii khatir behatar pradarshan jaruri he
 On winning, Mulayam will install his son Akhilesh Yadav as the heir in the state and can find a place in the cabinet by becoming a Congress partner at the Center

 barish main bhigi-bhigi mumbai abhinayta salmaan khan ko bahut acchhee lagati he lekin vah aagaamee 24 july ko lekar ashankit hai
 On this day, the waves of the sea have been predicted to rise to dangerous levels
 salmaan ne apane blog main likhaa he ki pichley kuch dinon se mumbai barish main bhig rahi he or bahut pyaari lag rahi he
 Anyway, the monsoon enhances the beauty of Mumbai
 unhone likhaa he ki haal hi main shuru kiye gaye si link par gaadi chalaane kaa majaa is saal barkhaa kii buundon ke bich kuch or hi hoga
 But the idea of 24 July is disturbing because waves are predicted to rise to dangerous levels on this day

 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha he ki desh main aam hindu, musalmaan, sikh or isai sab har vakt ek-duusare ke saath bahut aaraam se milakar rahane main hi puraa yakeen rakhte hai
 The Congress General Secretary said that despite this it is sad that there are people in every community and every religion who do not like peace and do such things which harm all of us
 singh ne kaha ki unhen yah maanane main jaraa bhi jhijak nahin he ki kai kaarnon ke chalate musalmaan bhaaiyon or bahanon main yah bhaavana panapati ja rahi he ki unke saath kai baar insaaf nahin hota he
 He said that we should take responsibility for this and we should not have any trouble in accepting it
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha ki islam bharat main aaj se 1400 saal pehle aayaa par is desh main kabhi bhi hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich main dharmik yuddh nahin hua or naa hi kabhi donon ke bich dharm ko lekar talwaar khinchi
 Digvijay Singh said that the evidence is that Raja Mansingh used to fight in Akbar's army, while Hashim Shah Suri was a very important part of Maharana Pratap's army
 unhone kaha ki yah desh ganga-jamuni samskruti kaa mulk he or jo log is samskruti ko todna chaahate hai, ve log kabhi bhi desh kii bhalaai nahin chaahate hai
 Digvijay Singh said that we should understand this very well and spread the message of peace and peace to the people
 argedy pramukh lalu prasad ke chote bete tejasvi yadav ko shaayad hi pehle kabhi apane janmdin par itani khushi mili hogi
 On Monday, 9 November 2015, where Tejashwi turned 26, his chair in the assembly was confirmed a day before that
 is dohari khushi ko argedy pramukh ke chote nawab ne apane andaaj main kaaryakartaaon ke saath saajha bhi kiya
 Lalu Prasad's party, which emerged as the biggest surma of the grand alliance victory in the political summer of Bihar, has got 80 seats in the state assembly
 ravivaar ko chunaav nateezon ke baad se hi utsahittejasvisomvaar ko apane janmdin par jab jage to baahar kaaryakartaaon or unke chaahane waalon kii lambii qatari thi
 Everyone congratulated him on his birthday
 mithai khilaai or phulon kii maala bhent kii
 Read, Tejaswi said - What is the future of Narendra Modi 'development is our priority', Tejaswi says, 'this is a chance of double happiness
 party kii jeet or meraa janmdin
 So enthusiasm and enjoyment is also double
 ' tejasvi ne apane samarthakon or kaaryakartaaon kaa mithai khilaakar dhanyavad kiya
 On his birthday, Tejashwi further said, "our priority is development
 bihar kaa vikaas
 We will put Bihar on the path of development so that the state becomes a model
 'tasveeron main dekhen, chunaav nateezon par kisne kya kahatin numberi se top parabihar kii raajnneeti main argedy ke punarjanm ke saath hilalu prasad ke donon betontej pratap or tejasvi ne raghopur or mahua vidhansabha seat se jeet darj kii he
 The last time Lalu's party got just 22 seats in the 243-member Bihar Legislative Assembly and he remained as the leader of the number three party in terms of figures
 desh main notebandi lagu hone ke baad se kalaadhan ko safed karne kaa kaala khel puure desh main badastoor jari he or bihar bhi usase achoota nahin he
 But the Bihar government's involvement in playing the black game of white money in Bihar is second to none
 sarkaar ke mulajimon dwaara is khel ko khele jane main pis rahi he bihar kii garib janata
 There is a recent case of Aurangabad district of Bihar by government employees playing the black game of white money
 jile ke goh prakhand ke dadar panchayat ke panchayat sevakon ne vidhwaa or vriddha pension ke naam garib labhaanviton ke bich sabhi niyam or kanoon ko taak par rakhkar paanch sau ke puraane note vitarit kar die
 The anger of the villagers rose to the seventh sky after the Panchayat Sevaks' case of disbursement of old currency notes of 500 rupees among the beneficiaries and all the Panchayat sevaks started protesting
 darasal vidhwaa or vriddha pension kaa bhugtan labhaanviton ke bich nakad na kar unke khaataa main bhej kar karne kaa praavdhaan he
 But all the beneficiaries were invited to the panchayat and the old note was distributed among all, because of the wrong intention of consuming the old note of five hundred by the Panchayat servants
 labhaanviton main se kisi ne iskaa bhandaphod kar diya ki 500 ke puraane note kaa chalan band ho jane ke baad bhi pension ke rup main is rupee kaa bhugtan kyon kiya gaya, phir kya hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 After the Block Development Officer intervened and the withdrawal of the old notes from the beneficiaries, the matter was resolved

 congress-jds government in Karnataka themed on the backfoot is not the case in Madhya Pradesh as the two mlas of BJP will be comfortable with the support of the BJP mlas
 Hours were not even here and in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Kamal Nath announced that two BJP mlas are with the Congress
 i am
 narayan treepathi or sharad kaul naam ke in donon bijepi vidhayakon ne congress main jane kii baat kii pushti kar di he
 On this big development in Madhya Pradesh, people are going to hear that Congress has avenged Karnataka in just 24 hours
 jo bijepi pehle kamalnath sarkaar giraane kaa dam bhar rahi thi, ab usee ke vidhayak virdohi kheme main taal thok rahe hai
 There was a big uproar in Karnataka on Tuesday evening and the 14-month-old congress-jds coalition government fell
 congress ke baagi vidhayakon ke istife se echdi kumaraswami kii sarkaar alpamat main aa gai or floor test main sarkaar dharashayi ho gai
 The Congress alleges that in Karnataka, the BJP gave a big lure to its mlas and got them to resign
 225 sadasyeey karnataka vidhansabha main vishwaas mat ke liye 20 vidhayak sadan main hajir nahin hue the
 99 votes in favor of the trust vote while 105 votes were cast against it
 iske saath hi bijepi ne elaan kar diya ki vah karnataka main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karegi
 a similar situation was seen in Madhya Pradesh
 jaisaa ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne kaha, upar se number ek or do kaa aadesh hua to ek din bhi nahin chalegi sarkaar
 After Bhargava's claim, speculations started that whether Madhya Pradesh was also following the path of Karnataka? But this did not happen and Chief Minister Kamal Nath said that 'BJP was telling our government in a minority and it was being talked about to topple anytime, but today during the voting, two BJP mlas have supported our government
 'karnataka jaisi nahin madhya pradesh kii sthitikarnataka main kumaraswami kii sarkaar baikfoot par aa gai thi kyonki uske kai vidhayak baagi ho gaye the or vidhansabhadhyaksh ko istipha saunp diya tha
 During the trust vote, 20 mlas did not appear for voting in the 225-member Karnataka Assembly
 vishwaas mat ke paksh main 99 jabaki iske khilaaf 105 vot pade or sarkaar gir gai
 With the rebel mlas of BJP, Kamal Nath here, the thing to note is that 14 Congress mlas resigned from the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, so the government had come to a minority there long ago but this is not the case in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya kii 230 vidhayakon vaali vidhansabha main congress ke 114 or bijepi ke 108 vidhayak hai
 Now it will be seen that do both BJP mlas leave the party? If this happens, the Congress will stand at 116 and BJP at 106
 congress ke liye yah bahumat kaa aankada hoga, jabaki bijepi yahaan baikfoot par hogi
 In such a situation, the Kamal Nath government's dependence on independents, BSP and SP mlas will be reduced
 haalanki in donon vidhayakon par dal badal kanoon ke tahat ayogy tehraae jane kii talwaar latakati rahegi lekin yah vidhansabha adhyaksh par nirbhar karegaa
 Let us tell you that many BJP leaders have claimed not to take long to topple the Kamal Nath government
 in bayanon ke bich kamalnath ne har baar yahi kaha ki rajya main congress kii sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he or vah puure paanch saal kaa apana shashan chalaaegi
 Further strengthening his talk, he announced on Wednesday that two BJP mlas have come into his camp
 kah sakate hai ki raajnneetik asthirataa kii atakalon ke bich kamalnath ne sanket de diya he ki unki party karnataka jaise halaat paidaa nahin hone degi or 24 ghante ke andar aisa kar dikhaane kaa unamem puraa damakham bhi he
 French right-hander Marine Le Pen, who is leading in the presidential election race, says she will resign as the party's chief to gain the support of a large number of people before the final round of elections on May 7
 
 pen ne 2011 main apane pita jin meri le pen ke baad neshnal front (enef) party kii kaman sanbhali thi
 At the same time, the current President François Hollande has appealed to the people to vote for Macron and choose the next President and not Marine Le Pen
 pen ne somvaar ko 'france 2' televijan ko bataaya ki "maine hameshaa yah sochaa he ki france kaa raashtrapati france ke sabhi logon kaa raashtrapati hota he or us par puure desh ko jodne kii jimmedaari hoti he lekin kathani ko kerani main badalane kii bhi jarurat he
 Penn said, "I have decided to leave the chairmanship of the National Front
 ab main party kii adhyaksh nahin rahuungi
 "we are the people who define democracy," Xinhua quoted Penn
 meri koi bhi gatividhiyaan logon ke liye khilaaf nahin hogi
 Only i can guarantee the security of the country

 If Penn (48) wins the election, she will be the first woman President of the country
 ye hai daud mendesh ke raashtrapati pad ke liye ho rahe chunaav main 11 ummidavaar maidan main hai
 Four of these candidates are considered to be the most dominant in this race, Conservative candidate François Filan, extreme right-wing Marin Le Pen, liberal centrist Emmanuel Macron and extreme leftist jean-luc Mellencon
 is chunaav main sheersh aaen do ummidavaaron ke bich saat may ko duusare daur kii pratispardhaa hogi
 All candidates have made several issues, including immigration, the economy and the French identity a major electoral issue
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan rashtriya suraksha ek pramukh mudda rahaa he
 Current President François Hollande is not contesting for a second term
 vah france ke aadhunik itihaas main aisa karne vaale pehle netaa hai, jo duusare kaarykaal ke liye chunaav maidan main nahin hai
 Can Prime Minister Narendra Modi dare to announce major economic reforms like railway, retail and banking from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15 August? Will Modi declare that a Bill will come in the Cold Session of Parliament to make legal arrangements to prevent conflict of interest in high positions? Can it be announced that the government will end the political presence in all sports associations by enacting a law? Can the Prime Minister show the courage of this announcement that a law will be made in six months to make the process of donations of political parties transparent? The Prime Minister has asked the country not what people want to hear from them on Independence Day, so here it is Expectations list
 yakeenan, desh ab unase naitik shiksha nahin sunanaa chahega
 Announcements of new schemes are not at all true
 jab kisi dal ke paas bhavy janadesh ho, vipaksh buree tarah tut chukaa ho, centre ke saath desh ke 11 rajyon main us dal yaa uske doston kii sarkaar ho, us dal kii sarkaar, darasal, pichhali sarkaar kii hi nitiyaan lagu kar rahi ho or pichhali sarkaar chalaane vaali party apana rajnatik mooldhan bhi gavaan chuki ho to phir sansad na chal paane kii vajah sirf mutthi bhar vipaksh kii ugrata nahin he
 The Modi government will now have to ask itself what it has done between August 15 and August 15 that has given such solidarity and energy to the desperate opposition
 endie sarkaar kii ulajhanon kaa majamoon manusan satr main sansadeey gatirodh kii dhundh ke paar chipa he
 The government faces the double challenge of credibility within a year, which is bigger than the upa's second innings
 pehali chunauti yah he modi sarkaar bhartiya loktantr ke teen alikhit mulyon par kamjor dikh rahi he, jo bahumat se bharpoor sarkaron ko bhi apraasangik kar dete hai
 The first rule is that in any situation the government should not be seen stopping freedom of expression
 doosraa siddhant he ki bahumat ho yaa alpamat, vipaksh ko saath lekar chalane kii kshamta honi chahie or teesraa niyam jo haal main hi judaa he ki ucch padon par paardarshita ko lekar koi bhi samjhauta saakh par buree tarah baari pad saktaa he
 In March this year, the government should have been alarmed after the curbs on freedom of expression (section 66A of the Information Technology Act) were rejected in March
 lekin supreme court main (aadhaar cese) niztaa ko moulik adhikaar na maanane kii taaja daleel, website par pratibandhon or unki vaapasi, soochna ke adhikaar par roak or swayamsevi sansthaaon par chaabuk chalaate hue lagaataar sarkaar sanket de rahi he ki vah kuch moulik aazaadiyon ko lekar sahaj nahin he
 In a parliamentary democracy, it is imperative to have a government with the opposition
 rajeev gandhi ke 413 sadasyon ke bahumat ke saamne 15 sadasyon kaa vipaksh naganya tha lekin use nakaarne kaa nateeja itihaas main darj he
 In light of the lesson the BJP had got from the Congress, it should have been strict to the extent of transparency about transparency in high positions
 alabatta loksabhaa main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj jab faraar lalit modi kii madad ko unki biimaar patni kii madad maanane kii bhavuk apil kar rahi thim to swaraj or modi parivaar ke kaarobaari rishton kaa ateet peeche se jhaank rahaa tha
 The biggest inconsistency is that no one understands these three values of Indian democracy better than the BJP, whose entire political life is spent fighting and harassing them with the Congress
 lekin bijepi ne ek saal ke bheetar hi us congress ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee, vipaksh kii ahmiyat or paardarshita kaa sabase bada pairokaar bana diya jo hameshaa in mulyon par apane kamjor ateet ko lekar asahaj rahi he
 The second challenge is also not light
 modi ko yah nahin bhoolanaa hoga ki ve khule bazaar kii pairokari, nijeekaran, sudhaar or nijee udhyamita ko badhaava dene ke model ko bakhaante hue satta main aae the lekin pichley ek saal main unke netritv main jo gavarnence nikali he usamen railway sudhaar, banking sudhaar, sabsidi punargathan, prashasnic sudhaar jaise saahsee faisle nahin dikhte
 The government is setting up new public steel plants (along with the states), covering the inefficiency of psus like the Congress, creating government schemes, creating new missions and bureaucracy and devising new ways of distributing subsidies
 Still working
 saamaajik skiimon par aapatti nahin he lekin gavarnence main sudhaar kaa saahas dikhaae bagaiyr puraane system par nae mishan or scimen thope di gai hai
 Therefore every mission is also empty of symbolic successes
 modi sarkaar se apeksha thi ki vah loktantric mulyon or udaarikaran ke nae pratimaan gadhegi jo na keval gavarnence kii congressi reeti-niti se alag honge balki vipaksh ke taur par bijepi kii bhuulon kaa pratikaar bhi karenge
 But the Modi government does not know why it wants to prove that major successes bring their own anti climax? It is not necessary that the moment of transition takes years, sometimes immediately after a transition Another may come
 2014 narendra modi ke paksh main aae janadesh ko bharat ke taaja itihaas kaa sabase bada sankraman maanane vaale shaayad ab khud ko sanshodhit karnaa chaahate honge, kyonki asli sankraman to darasal ab aayaa he jab modi satta main ek saal guzaar chuke hai or ummiido kaa ufaan ub, jhunjhalaahat or mohabhang kii nami lekar baithne laga he
 When Modi faces the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort next week, the country will not want to listen to him 'mann ki Baat' but talk of governance, because the people of the country want to once again confirm that they have put their weak shoulders on There is no burden of expectations

 'vidyane also said,' Often women stand up for the rights of their families, their children, but when it comes to themselves, they remain silent, so i salute Kangana's spirit and convey my best wishes
 vahiin jab amitabh bachchan se bhikangana-ritikavivaad ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya to unka jawaab tha, 'mujhe is baat ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin he

 - Gulzar Sahib found fire
 bheetar kii aag shant karnaa aasaan ho gaya
 Then made a wheel and started farming
 kheton kii dekhbhaal ke liye unke bich jhonpadi bana lee
 Dug wells or bastiyaan bas gayi
 Then when did the ruckus begin? us din, jis din ek aadmi ne ek tandi uthaakar jameen par ek gheraa banaaya
 And then said
 jameen kaa ye tukdaa meraa he
 The pieces kept growing
 fasaad lagaataar badhate gaye
 Clans were formed, Sultanates were formed, countries were made
 or is banane main bighad gaye insaan
 So look closely once again
 khet hai, khet ke bich jhonpadi he
 No, this is a military outpost
 isse kuch furlongs duuri par ek lakeer he
 Which is not visible
 lakeer ke us paar bataaya jaataa he ki pakistan he
 On this side is Hindustan
 ye bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he kyonki na bataaya jaae to fark samaj na aae
 People from the upper parts speak Punjabi there, too
 vahaan bhi cricket ke liye diwane hua jate hai, yahaan bhi
 There is corruption as well here
 vahaan waalon ko bataaya jaataa he ki saare fasaad kii jad hindustan vaale hai or hamen bhi sikhaaya jaataa he ki pakistan se nafrat karo
 But amidst this noise, some dervishes are sitting under an old banyan
 kandhon par kauon ko jamaaye
 They do not need a visa to go there
 ye darvesh kisse sunaate hai
 Of sharing
 aisa hi ek kissa ab parde par numaya hua he
 Name is Delhi, what is Lahore
 ye kissa us jhonpadi si dikhti outpost se shuru hota he or vahiin par khatm
 But where do the true stories end
 ve to beej kii tarah hamaare bheetar dhans jate hai
 Then when you get moisture, then it starts to rise
 vakt he 1948 kaa
 There is a military post on the indo-pak border
 pakistaniyon ne is par hamalaa kiya he
 Most people on both sides stayed on the farm
 pakistan kii taraf se bachaa ek sipaahi
 Rahmat Ali (vijayaraj)
 uskaa captain taana martha he, tu jinda he to aage bad
 Sasala Muhajir (people who migrated from India and settled in Pakistan) showed their loyalty to Pakistan
 rahamat aage badhata he
 He has to go and fetch a file from the enemy base
 is file main ek surang ke byore hai
 The tunnels that Hindustani is digging between Delhi to Lahore
 udhar, hindustani chaowkee par dar se kanpakpaata ek sipaahi he
 No, not just the uniform
 he to vah ek bawarchi
 The name is Samarth (manu Rishi Chadha)
 rahamat or samarth ke bich muthbhed shuru hoti he
 There is talk, even kick
 kabhi paranthe banate hai, to kabhi pani bharaa jaataa he
 Sometimes a shot is fired, sometimes it is abused
 or isi guftgu ke bich donon ke bahaane do mulkon kii takalif saamne aati he
 How humans were divided in politics
 rahamat jo dilli kaa rahane vaala tha or ab lahore main apni gali talash rahaa he
 Samarth, who was a boy of the Shahs of Lahore, is now setting foot in Delhi
 donon ke shaharon kaa zikr kya hua
 They got a common ground
 bandook kinare ho gai or jabaan aage
 One brother comes to his heart and the other brother to life
 magar har ped par shahad kahaan lagata he
 So, through some new characters in the story, the restlessness returns again, to impart the necessary lessons
 film main zyaadaatar seen or samvaad vijay raaj or manu rishi ke bich hai
 Both have done amazing acting
 jab samvaad kam hote hai, tab abhinay or bhi asardaar hota he
 But this happens rarely
 iske alaava raaj jutshi or vishwajit pradhan bhi chote role main mukammal asar chhodte hai
 The specialty of the film is its clever editing, good acting and the current dialogues, which sometimes create jokes and sometimes death
 magar behatar hota ki samarth or rahamat ke bich kii munhaachahi ko or vistaar diya jaataa
 After a while, it becomes monotonous
 film kaa becoground score bhi kabhi kabhi kuch zyada hi vajani ho jaataa he
 Vijay Raj has instilled a lot of confidence as a director
 gulzaar kii aawaaj film ko ek kism kii pavitrataa bakhshati he
 Manu Rishi has brought to light the dialogues of Lahore and Delhi
 film ko dekhakar tamaam logon ko us film kii yaad aa sakati he, jiske haathon auskar main lagaan haari thi
 Bosnia Herzegovina's film No Man's Land
 vahaan bhi do alag paalon main khadey sipaahi maanviya traasadee kaa aakhyaan apni kahaniyon or sanvaadon ke jariye sunaate hai
 There is something here too
 magar ek dikkat he
 Less with the film, more with us
 abhi kuch darvesh hai
 From Gulzar and Kuldeep Nayyar
 kuch guzar gaye khushvanth singh or yashpal se
 Those who used to tell us stories from across the side, they used to get hooked
 lahore apana sa lagata tha
 Used to live in Tafriah in Karachi
 mujhe yakeen he ki us taraf ke log bhi chandani chowk main nikaah kii kharidari ko machalate honge, tadapate honge
 But what really
 kya hamaare liye pakistan sirf ek badmaash padosi bhad he
 The partnership with him just stops here
 uske paar kuch nahin
 When this generation passes away, came here after Partition, will the Madri ideas born for that land with them also end
 mujhe is vakt piem manmohan singh kii shakl yaad aa rahi he
 His elder father was to go to the village in Pakistan, where he was born, grew up and studied for some time
 nahin ja sake
 Politics came in the way of a leader
 sochie jab piem nahin aa ja sakate, to aam insaanon kii bisaat hi kya
 And then these stories are saved, which keep the hope alive
 kabhi to aapasi takaraar kam hogi
 Sometimes we sit together and hum
 aman kaa geet gaayenge
 And during this dua, attention returns to the ground of the film
 kaash dilli or lahore ke bich ek surang hoti
 We used to stay connected from inside
 kya dilli kya lahore dekhie, taaki sanad rahe ki sirf jameen banty he
 And before this split everything was shared, is and will remain
 mujhe ummid he ki agle hafte sarhad paar jab ye film relies hogi, to unke khyaal bhi kuch aise hi honge
 Accumulating, acquiring, through love
 ladakar bhi kabhi koi jeeta he kya

 rajdhani dilli se patna kii duuri 1,000 kilometre se zyada he
 But on February 10, as soon as Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party dusted off Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP in the Delhi Assembly elections, it seemed that the distance for Nitish Kumar had miraculously reduced
 bihar main barason ke lalu-rabari raaj ke baad vikaas, sushasan or kanoon vyavastha kaa raaj kaayam karne kaa tamgaa hasil karne vaale purv mukhyamantri nitish ko aisa lag rahaa tha ki media ko sambodhit karte hue ve apane purv avatar main aa gaye hai
 He was weighing his political future continuously since he broke off his relationship with the BJP in June last year
 nitish ne 10 farvari ko ek-ek shabd taulate hue kaha, ''dilli ke chunaav parinaamon ne ek aisa sandesh diya he jiskaa asar rashtriya rajdhani se kahin zyada vyapak he
 We will repeat the Delhi results in Bihar
 '' usee shaam unhone kejariwal kii tarj par ujala or safed mafalar bhi dhaaran kar liya
 If these symbols are ignored one by one, then it seems that getting Delhi to double in Bihar is far away
 kahin us 1,000 kimi se bhi zyada dur, jitani duuri dilli-patna ke bich he
 The very next day, on February 11, both Kejriwal and Nitish met President Pranab Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan — Kejriwal had met the courtesan before forming the government, while Nitish was asked to parade his mlas in the hope of forming a government in Bihar
 Had brought kejariwal to apni jeet kii lahar par savaar hokar aae the, lekin nitish ke sir par usee subah kaale badal ghir aae jab patna hycourt ne unhen jedy(you) vidhayak dal kaa netaa banaae jane par roak laga di
 While Kejriwal has an advantage that he will no longer have to carry the burden of his friends who have become enemies, the problem with Nitish is that he will have to be friends first and then live with enemy-turned-friend Lalu Prasad Yadav, whose habit of sitting back Has been driving with remote control and as a partner he is also the judge for JD (U)
 iske alaava unke sir par jeethanram maanjhi kaa boj bhi he jinhen nitish ne apane bharose par apni jagah di thi lekin aajkal ve bijepi ke kareeb dikh rahe hai or mahadalit vot bank ko le udne kii firaaq main hai
 Engaging in caste equations is a simple arithmetic of Bihar's politics: if Nitish will gain 14 per cent Yadav votes by staying with Lalu, Manjhi is also in danger of losing 15 per cent of Mahadalit votes if he is removed from Bihar's chief minister's chair
 is
 apane samudaay ke netaa ko hataae jane se mahadalit jedy(you) se khafa ho saktaa he
 If Nitish did not take any step to win back the trust of the voters, it is natural for him to win the game
 dhyaan rahe ki bihar main vidhansabha chunaav aktubar-november main hone hai
 It is not possible for Nitish to return to those glorious days of 2010–13 when he came to power with his then ally BJP by winning huge votes and was called the creator of the new Bihar
 us sthiti main aane ke liye unhen vaise jabardast mehnat kerani hogi
 Since June 2013, however, the Bihar government continued to run entirely on the jugaad system and after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in May 2014, Nitish resigned as Chief Minister
 maanjhi ko apni jagah mukhyamantri kii kursi par baitaane ko shuruyaat main to unka masterstroke mana gaya jisase ummid thi ki bijepi ke khate main mahadalit voton ko khisakane se roka ja sakegaa, lekin jald hi yah kadam galat sabit hua
 Now JD (U) strategists also believe that their assessment was wrong that Manjhi, a politician of small stature and from Bihar's smallest caste, will remain silently a rubber stamp without any question
 maanjhi ne india today ko bataaya, ''maine khud ko bachaae rakhane ke liye apane kariyar main khud ko zyada tavajjo nahin di, lekin main apane atmasammman ko hameshaa ke liye nahin kuchal saktaa tha
 "manjhi himself admits that for the first two months he continued to work as instructed, but soon realized that there was a huge opportunity in his hands
" is sankochi mahadalit netaa ne jaan-boojhkar pehle se tay raste ko chhodane kaa faisla kiya, khud ko bihar kaa sabase bada dalit netaa pradarshit kiya or din bitate-bitate ve or majboot hote gaye
 As uneasiness grew in the Nitish Kumar camp, the JD (U) chief interrupted Manjhi's term by implementing an alternative plan, which he had promised him to do before the assembly elections
 Will keep on the chair
 nitish ko yah andeshaa ho gaya tha ki maanjhi jitani der tak kursi par bane rahenge, unke liye bihar kii siyasat main vaapasi utani kathin hoti jaaegi
 In the meantime, Manjhi too started his political idiom and he started insisting that only a Dalit could succeed him
 jaise-jaise unka aatmavishvaas badhata gaya, nitish baichaiyn hone lage
 But their position is not like that of Lalu Yadav, who has the support of 14 per cent Yadavs
 nitish kurmi jati se aate hai jisaki sankhya bihar main sirf teen fisadi he
 This is their crisis
 nitish or lalu ke liye maanjhi or unka mahadalit vot bank kitna ahm tha, yah isse samaj main aata he ki donon is sthiti ke saath kitni saavdhaanee se pesh aae
 He tried twice unsuccessfully to take Manjhi into confidence and transfer power with ease
 ye donon netaa bihar kii raajnneeti main hameshaa pakad banaae rakhane ke liye jane jate hai lekin 20 janvari tak haalat yah rahi ki donon koi faisla le paane kii sthiti main nahin the, jab lalu ne ghoshnaa kii ki maanjhi hi mukhyamantri bane rahenge
 Even though Lalu changed his side in the first week of February, he managed to give the message that the decision of Manjhi's fate is an internal matter of JD (U) and Nitish can take a decision on it
 is dauraan hue nuksaan ko kam karne ke liye jedy(you) ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ko laayaa gaya jinhone 6 or 7 farvari ko hui do daur kii baatcheet main maanjhi ko istipha dene ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii
 Sources reveal that Manjhi was said to be given a respectable position in the party and a ministerial berth was also proposed for his son, but he was not in the mood due to which Nitish was forced to remove him forcibly
 nitish ne jab 2007 main apni soshal ejineering shuru kii thi—jisamen 22 dalit upjatiyon main se paswan ko chhodkar 21 ko unhone mahadalit kii shrenee main daal diya or unke upar sarkari yojanaon kii bauchhaar kar di—tab ve dalit vot bank ko tod paane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 It was a major setback for Ram Vilas Paswan
 maanjhi ab agar bijepi ke kheme main chale gaye to yah faisla nitish par hi palatwaar kar saktaa he or dalit va mahadalit vot bank kaa dobaaraa ekikaran sambhav he
 Nitish has no problem with Manjhi
 vishleshkon kii maane to lalu bhi unke liye utani hi badi chunauti hai jinaki party ke samarthan par unki nirbharta sarkaar main tike rahane or vidhansabha chunaav tak main rahane vaali he
 Lalu specializes in running the government from behind
 chaara ghotaale main funsane ke chalate mukhyamantri pad se istipha dene ke baad ve barason tak apni patni rabari devi ko kursi par baitaakar sarkaar chalaa chuke hai
 Nitish Kumar cannot be Rabri Devi of course, yet he will have to stand with Lalu who does not get tired of telling people that he is Nitish's 'elder brother'
 badale main lalu isliye nitish kaa samarthan karte rahenge kyonki unhen apni rajnatik viraasat apane bacchon ko saunpane main isse sahajata hogi
 Once undergoing a heart operation and being banned in the fodder scam, Lalu is keen to give his legacy to one of his three children: eldest daughter Misa Bharti, who contested the last Lok Sabha election Defeated, the eldest son Tej Pratap or the youngest son Tejashwi Prasad
 philhal is puure ghatnakram par nigaah rakh kar intjaar karne vaali iklauti party bijepi hi he, jisaki ek vajah dilli main hui uski haar he
 Sushil Kumar Modi, senior BJP leader and deputy chief minister during Nitish's tenure, says, "the constitutional crisis has arisen in Bihar as Nitish Kumar is hungry for power
" ve is jhamele main bijepi ko khinchne kii anaavashyak koshish kar rahe hai jabaki aag unke ghar main lagi hui he
 "it is believed that Nitish Kumar will introduce some aggressive social engineering and take anti-corruption measures so that the remaining bet is in his hands but there is little time for seven months to do anything on the government or policy front
 
 bihar kii raajnneeti ke 2005 ke baad se lagaataar nau saal tak badshaah rahe nitish ke liye yah vakt vaaki kathin he, lekin is vakt jaruri soshal or siyaasi ejineering ko agar koi shakl de saktaa he to ve nitish hi hai
 Anyway, he is a trained electrical engineer
 unki samajhadaari or doordarshita is siyaasi sankat se paar paane se sabit hogi

 The body of 40-year-old Chetan Kumar Saini was found hanging on the wall of Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur on Friday morning
 shuruyaat main kile kii diwaar par koyale se likhi baton ko dikhaakar media ne yahi khabar bataai ki chetan ne aatmahatya kii he, lekin jis jagah laash mili vahaan kile kii chattaanon-pattharon par kuch aisi bhadakaau baaten likhi hui hai
 Which indicates that it was murder rather than suicide
 media kii shuruaati khabaron main yahi dikhaaya gaya ki chetan ne rajasthan or deshbhar main chal rahepadmavati filmake virodh main suicide kii he, kyonki koyale se likhi baton main film padmavati kaa zikr tha
 However, the matter looked somewhat different when it was investigated closely
 kile kii chattaanon par likhi baaten film ke nahin, balki film kaa virodh kar rahe logon ke khilaaf thim
 The media also highlighted the point in which it was found written on a rock in the fort that "we don't just hang effigies Padmavati"
 is likhaawat se pehle yah sandesh gaya ki chetan ne suicide kii he
 But this thing written on the rock of the fort was incomplete
 iske alaava 10 or bhi chattaanon par isi tarah kii baaten likhi pai gayi
 Taunting the people protesting against the Padmavati film on a rock, it is written that, "those opposing Padmavati, we do not just hang effigies from the fort"
 Are, especially Mr
 Rajput Karni Sena
 "do jagahon par chetan tantric likhaa hua he
 Tantrik was killed at one place and Chetan Tantrik was killed at one place "
 saaf he ki jinhone chetan ko markar latakaaya, wo nahin chaahate the ki ye maamla suicide kaa lage
 Hold on baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 An attempt has been made to give this murder a communal color on another rock
 jisamen likhi baton se aisa lage ki ye baaten kisi musalmaan ne likhi hai
 It is written on the rock that, "this is the condition of every Kafir
 jo kafir ko maaregaa, allaah ko pyaara hoga
 "" We do not hang effigies / Fellow of Allah
 "iske alaava chattaanon par teen aise massej likhe hai jinamein kafir shabd aata he
 Allah is written in two but these letters are missing
 saare massej par padhakar yahi nateeja nikalataa he ki ye aatmahatya kaa nahin balki hatya kaa maamla he, hatya ke peeche bhi ek sochi samajhi sajeesh thi taaki mudde ko hindu banaam musalmaan banaaya ja sake or fasaad karaayaa ja sake

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to the Central Government demanding that Sanjeev Chaturvedi, who was the deputy secretary in AIIMS, be relieved of the post so that he (kejriwal) can bring him to the post of his Officer on Special Duty (OSD)

 ye maamla isliye itnaa mahatvapurn he kyonki sanjeev chaturvedi kaa pehle bijepi or congress donon sarkaron se kaaphi takaraav ho chukaa he
 In such a situation, the question is arising whether the Center will free this officer with clear image to work in the Kejriwal government
 Although the current Health Minister JP Nadda has been writing letters to remove Chaturvedi from AIIMS and being sent back to Haryana as the first MP, when Chaturvedi was removed from the post of AIIMS CVO last year, Nadda is calm with the controversy that followed
 pehle kejariwal chaturvedi ko anti karpshan beuro ke pramukh ke taur par maang rahe the
 But now they are being sought as OSD
 parampara he ki mukhyamantri yaa koi doosraa mantri jab kisi adhikari ko apana oesady banaata he to amuman inkaar nahin kiya jaataa
 Perhaps that's why Kejriwal has sent a letter from the Modi government to this officer to make his OSD

 For the strengthening of the party, every activist Ahsutra says that in the midst of this edict, Rahrahul said, the party cannot be strong without understanding the importance of the workers
 ' rahul ne udhaaharan dete hue kaha, kaise pehle aresas kaa kaaryakarta bataur prachaarak apni bhoomika nibhaataa he, phir baad main uski entry bijepi main kii jaati he
 Similarly, we must also assure our worker that if he is working hard, then his opinion is also being taken in the decisions of the party and later the better worker will also be given important position in the organization
 'rahul kii hidaayat badali jaae party kii kaaryasalisutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki rahul kii is naseehat par netaaon ne sawaal uthaaya, 'kaise upie sarkaar ke dauraan kai aise pad khaali pade rahe, jahaan kaaryakartaaon ko edjust kiya ja saktaa tha

 rahul ne bataaya ki rajasthan main bhi tamaam pad khaali pade rahe, jahaan workars ko edjust kiya ja saktaa tha
 When we got information on this, it came to know that those posts were kept vacant only because the workers who will not get the posts will be unhappy and it is not possible to give the post to everyone

 saasand reddy ke is sawaal main rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 You saw
 do saansadon ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 In response to Reddy Saheb, the Ministry of Railways says that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 rail mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main yah zarur kaha he ki yah sahi nahin he ki 2014 ke baad se koi bhartee abhiyaan nahin chalaa he
 But this figure is interesting
 pehle jawaab hu ba hu pard lete hai
 Since 2014, 79,600 candidates in group-c and 90,534 candidates in group-d have been empaneled by Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells respectively
 jawaab main likhaa he 2014 se 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 yani chaar saal main railway kii kitni bhartiyon nikaleen ye hisaab kiijie or is saal jo nikali he use saamne rakhie to pataa chalegaa ki is dauraan railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari main karodon naujavaanon kaa intazaar kitna lanbaa rahaa hoga
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134
 ise aap chaar saal main baant den to 2014 se har saal nikalne vaali bhartiyon kii sankhya hoti 42, 533
 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000
 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he
 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders
 hamaari yah series ndtv

 The first question was that what is the zone-wise number of vacancies in all class groups in the railways including SC, ST category in the whole country? Thus, what is the reason for the posts lying vacant for a long time? Is the government considering starting a special recruitment drive to fill the vacancies? If yes, what is its details and by when is it likely to be started? Otherwise what are the reasons for this? rail mantri piyush goyal ne likhit jawaab diya he
 Ideally, this answer should have been on the front page of all Hindi and other newspapers, for which even the poor and unemployed pay their hard earned money and buy and read newspapers
 kya aapako pataa he ki railway ke sabhi zone main kul milakar 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 pad khaali hai
 This figure is as of 1 April 2017
 do lakh karod ke 2 ji ghotaale main kuch sabit nahin hua, magar do lakh padon par bahaali ho gai hoti to aaj desh ke kitne hi berojgaaron ke ghar main khushiyaan man rahi hoti
 The Railway Minister has written in the Lok Sabha that the number of vacancies in the railway is 2 lakh 22 thousand 159
 ab ise aap zone waar dekhie
 It is also placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha in the same reply
 har zone ke chaatr railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai isliye yah aankada unke liye bhi mahatvapurn he

 This year the Railway Minister claims that around 90,000 recruits have been released
 agar sabhi 2 lakh par bhartiyon nikal gayi hoti to berojgaar naujavaanon ke liye avasaron kaa vistaar ho jaataa
 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years

 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete
 yani bhartee nikali to he 2018 main, kya pataa puraa hote hote 2019 biit jaae, 2020 aa jaae
 Only students who take railway exams can tell better

 pashchim bengal ke mushirdabaad se saansad sipiem saansad mohammad badaruddoja khan or raiganj se sipiem saansad mohammad saleem ne 27 farvari ko tarankit prashn poocha tha
 He had many questions
 pehla sawaal ye tha ki puure desh main anusuchit jati, janajati shrenee sahit railway main sabhi varg samoohon main rikt pade padon kii zone-waar sankhya kitni he? is prakaar se lambey samay se rikt pade padon kaa kya kaaran he? kya rictiyon ko bharne ke liye sarkaar koi vishesh bhartee abhiyaan shuru karne par vichaar kar rahi he? yadi haa to iskaa byoraa kya he or ise kab tak shuru kiye jane kii sambhaavna he? nahin to iske kya kaaran hai? Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has given a written reply
 kaayade se yah jawaab sabhi hindi or anya akhbaaron ke pehle panne par hona chahie tha, jiske liye garib or berojgaar bhi apni mehnat kii kamai se paise dete hai or akhbaar kharid kar padhate hai
 Do you know that there are 2 lakh 22 thousand 159 vacancies in all zones of Railways? 1 april 2017 tak kaa yah aankada he
 Nothing proved in the 2G scam of 2 lakh crores, but if two lakh posts had been restored, today there would have been happiness in the house of so many unemployed people of the country
 rail mantri ne loksabhaa main likhakar diya he ki railway main khaali padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 he
 Now you see it zone wise
 yah bhi usee jawaab main loksabhaa ke patal par rakhaa gaya he
 Students of every zone prepare for railway exams so this figure is also important for them
 uttar railway me 27, 537 pad khaali hai 19,651 posts are vacant in Central Railway purv madhya main 17, 065 pad khaali hai Western Railway has 16, 520 posts vacant
 uttar madhya main 15,930 pad khaali hai North West Railway has 13,532 vacancies
 dakshin purv main 13, 212 pad khaali hai There are 12,670 vacancies in Northeast Railway
 purvottar seemaa railway main 11,044 pad khaali hai
 Southern Railway has 10,827 vacancies pashchim madhya railway main 10,626 pad khaali hai
 Northern Railway has 8, 95 posts vacant
 purv tat railway main 6,878 pad khaali hai
 There are 5, 211 vacancies in South Western Railway
 metro main 898 pad khaali hai The number of vacancies as on 1 April 2017 is 2 lakh 21 thousand 159
 is saal rail mantri kaa daawa he ki 90,000 ke kareeb bhartiyon nikali hai
 If all 2 lakhs had been recruited, opportunities would have expanded for unemployed youth
 mohammad saleem or mohammad badaruddoja khan kaa ek or sawaal tha ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke kitne pad khaali hai to rail mantralay ne bataaya he ki 1 april 2017 tak in do shreniyon main 41, 128 pad khaali hai Do you know how long it takes to complete the recruitment process in Railways? Find out from any zone of the railways
 iskaa ausat wo bataaenge kam se kam 2 saal or adhik se adhik teen saal
 In many cases it takes up to 4 years
 ek pariksha kii hedline dekhakar khush hone se pehle yah bhi samaj len ki ise puraa hone main 2 saal teen saal legaa
 That is, if recruitment is out in 2018, what will be the completion of the address by 2019, come 2020
 railway kii pariksha dene vaala chaatr hi behatar bataa sakate hai
 On 7 February, Lok Sabha MP PV Midun Reddy has also starred in the question
 pivi midun reddy wiesar congress party ke saansad hai, andhrapradesh ke rajampet se
 In this question of Sasand Reddy, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 aapane dekha
 In response to two mps, the Ministry of Railways says that more than 2 lakh posts are vacant
 reddy sahab ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 The Railway Ministry has stated in its written reply that it is not true that there has been no recruitment drive since 2014
 lekin yah aankada dilachasp he
 First, we read the answer
 2014 se railway bhartee bordon or railway bhartee selon dwaara kramash: group- si main 79,600 or group-di main 90,534 ummidavaar panelabaddh kiye gaye hai
 It is written in response that from 2014 to 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 i
e
 how many recruitments of the Railways came out in four years and keep in mind what has come out this year, then it will be known that during this time, millions of youngsters are waiting for the preparation of railway exams
 How long it must have been
 2014 se lekar 2017 tak group-si or grud kii kul bhartiyon nikaleen 1 lakh 70 hazaakar 134
 If you divide it in four years, then from 2014, the number of recruits will be 42, 533
 2018 main jo bhartiyon nikali hai unki sankhya 90,000 bataai ja rahi hai
 That is, this year, recruitment has doubled compared to the average of the last four years
 kaash rail mantri in bhartiyon ko chah maheene main puraa karke dikhaa dete
 The average time of completion of recruitments would be reduced to 6 months, which is currently 2 to 3 years
 bilkul ho saktaa he
 What an energetic minister like him cannot do
 vaise abhi tak nahin hua, prabhu ji nahin kar paae to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki piyush goyal se nahin hoga
 Compliments of millions of students will be received
 jo bhi he teen saansadon kii badaulat railway main bhartee ko lekar aapke paas kam se kam kuch thos aankada to aa gaya
 That is why they thank you
 kya vaaki railway main staff kii baari kami nahin he, is par rail union kaa kya kahana he
 SSC exams are always in dispute
 iske pariksha kendron kaa bhi haal lenaa zaruri ho gaya he ki pariksha hoti kahaan hai
 What kind of centers are there? is bich aapako pataa hi he ki esayssi sijiel 2015 or 16 kii pariksha kaa nateeja agast se aktubar 2017 ke bich aa chukaa tha
 But he did not join till the end of January
 15000 se adhik chaatr pareshaan gum rahe the
 Our series started about this
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki 11,000 naujavaanon kii jwining kii prakriya shuru hui he
 But students have started messaging about it that someone has gone medical but is not getting the letter, so after getting the joining cadre of someone, it is stuck
 phir bhi maamla aage badha he to chaatr khush hai
 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come
 somvaar 5 march ko jab excise or custom vibhaag main inakam tex inspector or tex clerk kii jwining kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Their number is 1635 only
 ye chaatr bahut khush hai
 First pass the exam in three years, then pass and wait for joining for seven to eight months
 kitna torchar hota hoga
 Do you know at which centers SSC exam takes place
 kuch to bade centre hote hai jo iti companiyon kii hoti he, lekin bahut centre kaa haal dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath aisa khilwaad kaise ho saktaa he
 We do not want to go through the process of choosing the center, but we want you to visit these centers
 gauge len
 See what kind of fun your kids are having
 pehle ye video dekhie, elahabaad main 5 or 6 march ko chaatro ne esayssi ke intazaamon ke kilaaf pradarshan kiya, raily nikaali or dharna bhi diya he
 The slogan of their rally is first they have fought the whites and now they will fight with the thieves
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
 Don't know how many episodes will go on, but there is no special change in the situation
 12, 460 shikshak court se do do baar mukadmaa jeet jate hai, magar un adeshon ke baad bhi naukari nahin milti he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has given a written reply
 kaayade se yah jawaab sabhi hindi or anya akhbaaron ke pehle panne par hona chahie tha, jiske liye garib or berojgaar bhi apni mehnat kii kamai se paise dete hai or akhbaar kharid kar padhate hai
 Do you know that there are 2 lakh 22 thousand 159 vacancies in all zones of Railways? 1 april 2017 tak kaa yah aankada he
 Nothing proved in the 2G scam of 2 lakh crores, but if two lakh posts had been restored, today there would have been happiness in the house of so many unemployed people of the country
 rail mantri ne loksabhaa main likhakar diya he ki railway main khaali padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 22 hazaar 159 he
 Now you see it zone wise
 yah bhi usee jawaab main loksabhaa ke patal par rakhaa gaya he
 Students of every zone prepare for railway exams so this figure is also important for them
 uttar railway me 27, 537 pad khaali hai 19,651 posts are vacant in Central Railway purv madhya main 17, 065 pad khaali hai Western Railway has 16, 520 posts vacant

 is saal rail mantri kaa daawa he ki 90,000 ke kareeb bhartiyon nikali hai
 If all 2 lakhs had been recruited, opportunities would have expanded for unemployed youth
 mohammad saleem or mohammad badaruddoja khan kaa ek or sawaal tha ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke kitne pad khaali hai to rail mantralay ne bataaya he ki 1 april 2017 tak in do shreniyon main 41, 128 pad khaali hai Do you know how long it takes to complete the recruitment process in Railways? Find out from any zone of the railways
 iskaa ausat wo bataaenge kam se kam 2 saal or adhik se adhik teen saal
 In many cases it takes up to 4 years
 ek pariksha kii hedline dekhakar khush hone se pehle yah bhi samaj len ki ise puraa hone main 2 saal teen saal legaa
 That is, if recruitment is out in 2018, what will be the completion of the address by 2019, come 2020
 railway kii pariksha dene vaala chaatr hi behatar bataa sakate hai
 On 7 February, Lok Sabha MP PV Midun Reddy has also starred in the question
 pivi midun reddy wiesar congress party ke saansad hai, andhrapradesh ke rajampet se
 In this question of Sasand Reddy, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has said that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 aapane dekha
 In response to two mps, the Ministry of Railways says that more than 2 lakh posts are vacant
 reddy sahab ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 The Railway Ministry has stated in its written reply that it is not true that there has been no recruitment drive since 2014
 lekin yah aankada dilachasp he
 First, we read the answer
 2014 se railway bhartee bordon or railway bhartee selon dwaara kramash: group- si main 79,600 or group-di main 90,534 ummidavaar panelabaddh kiye gaye hai
 It is written in response that from 2014 to 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 i
e
 how many recruitments of the Railways came out in four years and keep in mind what has come out this year, then it will be known that during this time, millions of youngsters are waiting for the preparation of railway exams
 How long it must have been
 2014 se lekar 2017 tak group-si or grud kii kul bhartiyon nikaleen 1 lakh 70 hazaakar 134
 If you divide it in four years, then from 2014, the number of recruits will be 42, 533
 2018 main jo bhartiyon nikali hai unki sankhya 90,000 bataai ja rahi hai
 That is, this year, recruitment has doubled compared to the average of the last four years
 kaash rail mantri in bhartiyon ko chah maheene main puraa karke dikhaa dete
 The average time of completion of recruitments would be reduced to 6 months, which is currently 2 to 3 years
 bilkul ho saktaa he
 What an energetic minister like him cannot do
 vaise abhi tak nahin hua, prabhu ji nahin kar paae to iskaa matlab yah nahin ki piyush goyal se nahin hoga
 Compliments of millions of students will be received
 jo bhi he teen saansadon kii badaulat railway main bhartee ko lekar aapke paas kam se kam kuch thos aankada to aa gaya
 That is why they thank you
 kya vaaki railway main staff kii baari kami nahin he, is par rail union kaa kya kahana he
 SSC exams are always in dispute
 iske pariksha kendron kaa bhi haal lenaa zaruri ho gaya he ki pariksha hoti kahaan hai
 What kind of centers are there? is bich aapako pataa hi he ki esayssi sijiel 2015 or 16 kii pariksha kaa nateeja agast se aktubar 2017 ke bich aa chukaa tha
 But he did not join till the end of January
 15000 se adhik chaatr pareshaan gum rahe the
 Our series started about this
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki 11,000 naujavaanon kii jwining kii prakriya shuru hui he
 But students have started messaging about it that someone has gone medical but is not getting the letter, so after getting the joining cadre of someone, it is stuck
 phir bhi maamla aage badha he to chaatr khush hai
 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come
 somvaar 5 march ko jab excise or custom vibhaag main inakam tex inspector or tex clerk kii jwining kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Their number is 1635 only
 ye chaatr bahut khush hai
 First pass the exam in three years, then pass and wait for joining for seven to eight months
 kitna torchar hota hoga
 Do you know at which centers SSC exam takes place
 kuch to bade centre hote hai jo iti companiyon kii hoti he, lekin bahut centre kaa haal dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath aisa khilwaad kaise ho saktaa he
 We do not want to go through the process of choosing the center, but we want you to visit these centers
 gauge len
 See what kind of fun your kids are having
 pehle ye video dekhie, elahabaad main 5 or 6 march ko chaatro ne esayssi ke intazaamon ke kilaaf pradarshan kiya, raily nikaali or dharna bhi diya he
 The slogan of their rally is first they have fought the whites and now they will fight with the thieves
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
 Don't know how many episodes will go on, but there is no special change in the situation
 12, 460 shikshak court se do do baar mukadmaa jeet jate hai, magar un adeshon ke baad bhi naukari nahin milti he
 The Railway Minister has written in the Lok Sabha that the number of vacancies in the railway is 2 lakh 22 thousand 159
 ab ise aap zone waar dekhie
 It is also placed on the floor of the Lok Sabha in the same reply
 har zone ke chaatr railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari karte hai isliye yah aankada unke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 Northern Railway has 27, 537 vacancies
 madhya railway main 19,651 pad khaali hai 17,065 posts are vacant in East Central pashchim railway main 16, 520 pad khaali hai
 There are 15,930 vacancies in North Central uttar pashchim railway main 13, 532 pad khaali hai There are 13,212 vacancies in South East purvottar railway main 12, 670 pad khaali hai
 There are 11,044 vacancies in the North Eastern Border Railway
 dakshin railway main 10,827 pad khaali hai West Central Railway has 10,626 vacancies
 uttar railway main 8, 95 pad khaali hai
 There are 6,878 vacancies in East Coast Railway
 dakshin pashchim railway main 5, 211 pad khaali hai
 There are 898 vacancies in Metro 1 april 2017 tak khaali pade padon kii sankhya 2 lakh 21 hazaar 159 he
 This year the Railway Minister claims that around 90,000 recruits have been released
 agar sabhi 2 lakh par bhartiyon nikal gayi hoti to berojgaar naujavaanon ke liye avasaron kaa vistaar ho jaataa
 Mohammed Salim and Mohammad Badruddoza Khan had another question that how many posts of SC and ST are vacant, then Ministry of Railways has told that 41, 128 posts are vacant in these two categories till 1 April 2017
 kya aap jaanate hai ki railway main bhartee prakriya ko puraa hone main kitna vakt lagata he? railway ke aap kisi bhi zone se pataa kiijie
 They will give an average of at least 2 years and more than three years
 kai maamalon main 4 saal bhi lag jate hai
 Before being happy to see the headline of an exam, also understand that it will take 2 years to three years to complete
 yani bhartee nikali to he 2018 main, kya pataa puraa hote hote 2019 biit jaae, 2020 aa jaae
 Only students who take railway exams can tell better
 7 farvari ko loksabhaa main saasand pivi midun reddy ne bhi tarankit prashn kiya he
 PV Midun Reddy is a YSR Congress Party MP from Rajampet in Andhra Pradesh
 saasand reddy ke is sawaal main rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaha he ki railway staff kii baari kami kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he
 You saw
 do saansadon ke jawaab main rail mantralay kahata he ki 2 lakh se adhik pad khaali hai
 In response to Reddy Saheb, the Ministry of Railways says that the railway is not facing a huge shortage of staff
 rail mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main yah zarur kaha he ki yah sahi nahin he ki 2014 ke baad se koi bhartee abhiyaan nahin chalaa he
 But this figure is interesting
 pehle jawaab hu ba hu pard lete hai
 Since 2014, 79,600 candidates in group-c and 90,534 candidates in group-d have been empaneled by Railway Recruitment Boards and Railway Recruitment Cells respectively
 jawaab main likhaa he 2014 se 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 yani chaar saal main railway kii kitni bhartiyon nikaleen ye hisaab kiijie or is saal jo nikali he use saamne rakhie to pataa chalegaa ki is dauraan railway kii pariksha kii taiyaari main karodon naujavaanon kaa intazaar kitna lanbaa rahaa hoga
 From 2014 to 2017, the total recruitments of group-c and Grud turned out to be 1 lakh 70 Hajakar 134
 ise aap chaar saal main baant den to 2014 se har saal nikalne vaali bhartiyon kii sankhya hoti 42, 533
 The number of recruitments released in 2018 is said to be 90,000
 yani isi saal bhartee pichley chaar saal ke ausat kii tulana main dabl nikali he
 i wish the Railway Minister could have completed these recruitment in six months
 bhartiyon ko puraa hone ke samay ke ausat ko 6 maheene par laa dete jo is vakt 2 se 3 saal he
 Exactly
 unke jaisaa urjavan mantri chaahe to kya nahin kar saktaa he
 Well, it has not happened yet, if Prabhu ji could not do it does not mean that Piyush will not be from Goyal
 lakhon chaatro kii duaen milenge
 Whatever it is, due to the three mps, you have at least some solid data about recruitment in the railway
 isliye inkaa shukriya to banataa hi he
 Is there really a huge shortage of staff in the railways, what does the union say on this
 esayssi kii pariksha hameshaa vivaadon main rahati he
 Its examination centers have also become necessary to know where the examinations take place
 kis tarah ke centre hote hai
 In the meantime, you know that the result of SSC CGL 2015 and 16 examinations came between August and October 2017
 magar janvari biit jane tak inaki jwining nahin hui thi
 More than 15000 students were wandering around
 isi ko lekar hamaari series shuru hui thi
 We told you that the process of joining 11,000 youth has started
 magar ise lekar bhi chaatr massej karne lage hai ki kisi kaa medical ho gaya he magar letters nahin mil rahaa he, to kisi kii jwining kader milane ke baad ataki hui he
 Still, the matter has moved forward, the students are happy
 department of post main acountint pad ke liye chune gaye chaatro kii besabri badhati ja rahi he ki unka letters kab aayega
 On Monday 5 March, when the process of joining the Income Tax Inspector and Tax Clerk in the Excise and Customs Department started
 inaki hi sankhya 1635 he
 These students are very happy
 pehle to pariksha paas kiijie teen saal main, phir paas kar jwining ke liye intazaar kiijie saat aath maheene
 What a torture it would be
 kya aap jaanate hai ki esayssi kii pariksha kin centaron par hoti he
 There are some big centers which belong to IT companies, but you will be surprised by seeing the condition of many centers, how can such a mess happen with the future of millions of students
 ham centre chunane kii prakriya main nahin janaa chaahate magar ham chaahate hai ki aap in centaron kaa muyna karen
 Take review dekhen ki aapke bacchon ke saath kis tarah kaa mazaaq ho rahaa he
 Watch this video first, on 5 and 6 March in Allahabad, students demonstrated against SSC arrangements, took out a rally and staged a sit-in
 inaki raily kaa naaraa he pehle lade hai goron se ab ladenge choron se
 Now come to the question of examination center
 kai centaron ko lekar chaatro ne sawaal uthaaen hai
 Our colleague Ajay Singh in Banaras has himself visited and checked several centers on the spot
 kai centre chote-chote gharon main kiraye par chalate vaale computer institute main chalate hai
 There is no place to sit, their address is also difficult to find
 in centaron main setting ke zarie nakal kii guzaaish bad jaati he
 Earlier the exam was subjective, then the school was in college, ever since the objective pattern has come, it has started happening in the computer center
 in centaron ko out sorce kiya jane laga he
 See this center of Sigra area of varanasi
 ye hardware institute he yahaan bhi pariksha ho rahi he
 In this small institution, the roll number is installed at the gate
 andar pariksha chal rahi he
 Students say that those who have gone in, we cannot see what they are feeding
 darasal centre kam hone ke kaaran ye parikshaayen kai paali main or kai din tak chalati he
 Because of this, there is rigging and rumors of rigging also fly away
 ajay singh ne koching manager se baat kii aap khud sun len
 We are telling from a city
 chaatro ne kai shaharon se jo tasviren bheji hai wo bhayaavah hai
 You will not believe that such a big test can happen
 jab hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai to phir aan line pariksha kii maaramaari kyon he
 This is the second center in Sigra area of varanasi
 sadak par janarator rakhaa he or usee par role number or sitting arrangement kii suchi chipka di gai he
 In addition to the Computer Institute, this building has hostels and other business activities
 yahi esayssi kaa centre he
 This building is of BJP MLA
 get par kaa naam bhi tanga he
 Ravi Tripathi is a BJP MLA from Bhadohi
 ham nahin kehete ki unki koi bhoomika he magar pariksha centre ke baahar vidhayak kaa naam tanga dekhakar afvaahon ko bal milane lagata he
 In their bleeding, students can naturally be suspicious if they had SSC examination in a rented computer center
 esayssi ko aisi jagahon par centre dene se pehle thik se jaanch kerani chahie
 The case of recruitment of 12, 460 teachers in Uttar Pradesh goes through a strange turn
 hamane in shikshakon kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya magar usase kai sau guna baar in chaatro ne apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kiya he
 Not only the sit-in demonstration, these teachers also fought their battle in the court
 vahaan se jeet kar bhi ye haar jate hai
 On 3 November 2017, a single bench of the High Court had asked the UP government that these teachers should be recruited in 2 months
 3 janvari 2018 ko do maheene puure ho gaye magar 12,460 shikshak bahaali kaa intazaar karte rah gaye
 The case was then heard in the division bench
 vahaan se bhi ye 12, 460 shikshak jeet gaye
 This time the High Court asked the UP government to start the recruitment process within 4 weeks
 6 march ko chaar hafte puure ho gaye
 Students do not know anything
 shaayad sarkaar ko pataa ho jo kisi ko pataa nahin he
 The comments 2016 main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha
 Its counseling continued till March 2017
 18 march 2017 tak saare zile ke cat of gaye or merit list ban gai thi
 But on 23 March, the Yogi government banned these recruitments
 iske baad se ye noujvaan har maukey par pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These photos are of his performances, sent by him
 yahaan tak ki 16 july 2017 se teen sitambar 2017 tak dhai maheene lakhanu ke lakshmana mela maidan main dharna bhi diya
 12, 460 teachers win from the court but do not win from the government
 har tarah ke mantri se mil aate hai, saansadon se mil aate hai magar inaki bhartee kii prakriya shuru nahin hoti
 Court order also does not apply
 aap dekh hi rahe hai ki naukariyon kii kya haalat he
 We have come to the 24th episode
 pataa nahin kitne episod tak chalate chale jaaenge, lekin halaat main koi khaas badlaav nahin he
 12, 460 Teachers win two cases out of court, but do not get jobs even after those orders

 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers

 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here

 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself

 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he

 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands

 In the Department of Post, the students selected for the post of accountant are growing eagerly when their letter will come
 somvaar 5 march ko jab excise or custom vibhaag main inakam tex inspector or tex clerk kii jwining kii prakriya shuru ho gai
 Their number is 1635 only
 ye chaatr bahut khush hai
 First pass the exam in three years, then pass and wait for joining for seven to eight months
 kitna torchar hota hoga
 Do you know at which centers SSC exam takes place
 kuch to bade centre hote hai jo iti companiyon kii hoti he, lekin bahut centre kaa haal dekhakar aap hairaan rah jaaenge ki lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath aisa khilwaad kaise ho saktaa he
 We do not want to go through the process of choosing the center, but we want you to visit these centers
 gauge len
 See what kind of fun your kids are having
 pehle ye video dekhie, elahabaad main 5 or 6 march ko chaatro ne esayssi ke intazaamon ke kilaaf pradarshan kiya, raily nikaali or dharna bhi diya he
 The slogan of their rally is first they have fought the whites and now they will fight with the thieves
 ab aate hai pariksha centre ke sawaal par
 Students have raised questions about many centers
 banaras main hamaare sahyogi ajay singh ne khud jaakar maukey par kai centaron ko check kiya he
 Many centers run in rented computer institutes in small homes
 baithne kii jagah nahin hoti, inkaa pataa bhi mushkil se miltaa he
 The setting in these centers increases the scope of copying
 pehle pariksha subjective hoti thi to skool college main hoti thi, jab se abjective pattern aayaa he tab se computer centre main hone lagi he
 These centers are being outsourced
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake ke is centre ko dekhie
 This is a hardware institute, the examination is also being done here
 chote se jagah main chal rahe is institute main role number get par laga he
 Examination is going on inside
 chaatr kehete hai ki jo bheetar gaye hai ham dekh nahin paa rahe hai ki wo kya gul khilaa rahe hai
 Actually, due to the lack of centers, these examinations run in many shifts and for many days
 is vajah se bhi dhaandhlee ho jaati he or dhaandhlee kii afvaah bhi ud jaati he
 Ajay Singh talked to the coaching manager, you should listen yourself
 ham to ek shahar se bataa rahe hai
 The pictures that students have sent from many cities are horrifying
 aap yakeen nahin karenge itani badi pariksha kaa yah haal ho saktaa he
 When we do not have the resources, then why is there an on-line examination
 varanasi ke cigara ilaake main hi yah doosraa centre he
 a generator is placed on the road and a roll number and seating arrangement are listed on it
 is building main computer institute ke alaava hostel bhi he or duusari vyavsaayik gatividhiyaan bhi chalati hai
 This is the center of SSC
 yah building bhaajapa ke vidhayak kii he
 The name of the gate is also hung
 ravi treepathi ji bhadohi se bhaajapa ke vidhayak hai
 We do not say that he has any role, but seeing the name of the MLA hanged outside the examination center, rumors start to gain strength
 unki bliding main agar kiraaye par chalane vaale computer centre main esayssi kii pariksha hoti to chaatr swaabhaavik rup se andeh kar sakate hai
 SSC should be properly examined before placing centers in such places
 uttar pradesh main 12, 460 shikshakon kii bhartee kaa maamla ajeeb mode se guzarataa rahata he
 We have raised the issue of these teachers many times, but several hundred times more than that, these students have demonstrated to protest their demands
 sirf dharna pradarshan hi nahin balki in shikshakon ne apni ladaai adaalat main bhi ladi
 They also lose by winning from there
 3 november 2017 ko hoicourt ke single bench ne upi sarkaar se kaha tha ki 2 maheene main in shikshakon kii bhartee ho jaani chahie
 Two months were completed on 3 January 2018, but 12,460 teachers were waiting for reinstatement
 phir yah maamla division bench main suna gaya
 From there also these 12, 460 teachers won
 is baar hoicourt ne upi sarkaar se kaha ki 4 hafte ke bheetar bhartee kii prakriya shuru kiijie
 Four weeks were completed on 6 March
 chaatro ko kuch pataa nahin he
 Perhaps the government knows what no one knows
 tippaniyan In 2016, advertisements for the recruitment of 12, 460 teachers were released
 march 2017 tak isaki counselling chalati rahi
 By 18 March 2017, the entire district was cut off and merit list was made
 lekin 23 march ko yogi sarkaar ne in bhartiyon par roak laga di
 Since then, these youngsters have been performing on every occasion
 ye tasviren unheen ke pradarshnon kii he, unheen kii bheji hui he
 Even two and a half months from July 16, 2017 to September 3, 2017, staged a protest at the Lakshman Mela ground in Lucknow
 12, 460 shikshak court se jeet jate hai magar sarkaar se nahin jeet pate hai
 Meet all types of ministers, meet mps, but their recruitment process does not begin
 court kaa aadesh bhi lagu nahin ho pota he
 You are watching what is the condition of jobs
 ham 24 wein episod tak aa chuke hai
