 a unique list of unemployed people of India has come out, which shows very clearly how many registered unemployed state by state in employment offices spread across the country
 chaar karod 75 lakh se zyada berozegaron kii is fehrist main naukari sirf teen lakh se kuch zyada berozegaaro ko hi mili he, or ye suchi bharat sarkaar kii hi he
 That is, the government knows that there are 79,91,000 registered unemployed people in Tamil Nadu
 - pan bengal main 76,71,700 registerd berozegaar hai
 - There are 68,56,300 registered unemployed in UP
 - dilli main 11,98,200 registerd berozegaar hai
 The condition of the country is that out of 978 employment offices, 4,82,61,100 are registered unemployed, out of which only 3,38,500 youth have got employment
 vahiin rojgaar daftaron kii halaat bhi behad kharaab he
 It seems as if the employment offices are unemployed, where the unemployed do register their names, but no one gets the job
 aise main sawaal he ki kya rojgaar daftaron ko band kar dena chahie?rojgaar daftaron se naukari kitnon ko milti he ye sabase badi lottery kii tarah he, kyonki dilli main 100 rojgaar, to bengal main 1500 or upi main 1300 logon ko hi rojgaar daftar se naukari mili
 10 states where none of the jobs were found
 puure desh main rojgaar daftar hi ek fisadi se kam 0
 Employed 7 percent
 rojgaar daftar chalaane kaa matlab yahi he ki daftar chalaane se hi jo rojgaar mil jaae vahi bahut he, yaa sarkaar ke paas koi kaam hi nahin he to rojgaar daftar chal rahe hai, kyonki kam se kam ek se do lakh rupee to har rojgaar daftar ko chalaane main lagata hi hoga
 In such a situation, one year was spent on 978 employment offices of the country, 12 to 22 thousand lakh rupees would have been spent
 haalanki desh kaa sankat yahi he ki har sarkaar kahati he rojgaar denge
 Employment is being given and there is no employment
 lekin sankat he kitna baari ye sarkari dastavej hi bataa dete hai
 Former South Africa captain Sean Pollack believes that Virat Kohli gets his glimpse in Hardik Pandya and he predicted this all-rounder to get a long chance in the Indian team
 pola ne kaha, ‚Äòmujhe spasht taur par sanket mili hai ki kohli hardik pandya ke ravaiye ko pasand karte hai
 This is very similar to the kind of cricket that Kohli plays
 or use yah ravaiya pasand he isliye acchhee sambhaavna he ki pandya ko team main jamane or apni jagah pakki karne ke liye lanbaa samay milegaa
 "kohli likes Pandya's style of playing the most successful bowler in South Africa, Pollack said," It is the nature of cricket, if the captain likes the way a player plays, then the player gets extra opportunities
 'VIDEO: asli game changer to pandya the, ek hi thro par africa ko nipta dalaapandya ne paanchaven vanade main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 73 ran kii jeet ke dauraan acha pradarshan kiya jisase bharat yahaan pehali siries jeetne main safal rahaa
 Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav's pair of wrist spinners also performed well and took six wickets once again
 kuldeep-chahal kaa jawaab nahimpitiai ke mutabik chahal or kuldeep kii tarif karte hue pola ne kaha, ‚Äòagar aap unke vanade aankade dekho to kuldeep kaa ausat 20 se kam he or usne 38 wicket chatkaaye hai
 He said, 'chahal is also similar and his average is 22
 in donon kaa ichonami rate shandaar he
 But can they win India the World Cup in England
 yah acha he ki aapako vahaan kaa daura karne kaa mauka milegaa jisase vahaan unke pradarshan kaa akalan ho sakegaa
 You will not always find wickets in England where the ball is turned

 " The battle for the words of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, has been shattered
 
 
 raajnneeti ke scrtch card par sajaai gai bhaavnaatmak maryaada kii patali parat khurch chuki he
 
 
 The barcode of power has come before everyone
 
 
 amethi ke maidan main chhidi jubaani jang kii anugunj puraa desh dekh or sun rahaa he
 
 
 The high morality is rooted in the abyss of 'low politics', and Modi and Priyanka are face to face
 
 
 amethi kii sabha main narendra modi ne bijepi ummidavaar smriti irani ko apni choti bahan bataaya
 
 
 This was necessitated because Priyanka Gandhi had responded a day earlier to a question from reporters related to Smriti Irani's claim "
 
 
 koun
 
 
 ? ‚Äùthat is, Priyanka refused to accept Smriti Irani in the race against Rahul Gandhi, and questioned her identity
 
 
 narendra modi ko yah nagavar guzara, isliye unhone smriti irani kaa parichay dete hue use apni choti bahan bataaya or janata se choti bahan ke liye vot maanga, use jitaane kii apil kii
 
 
 Gave an hour-long speech, read ballads in the pride of the younger sister
 
 
 to kya choti bahan ke liye umada pyaar 'beti' kii haisiyat par baari padaa
 
 
 The haalanki narendra modi ne priyanka gandhi kaa sidhe taur par naam nahin liya, lekin jab unhone rahul gandhi ke rajeev gandhi ke nakshekadam par chalane kii baat ko lekar kataaksh kiya to zaahir he, nishane par priyanka hi thim
 
 
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had told Rahul during the campaign in Amethi that he had a forward thinking like Rajiv Gandhi
 
 
 rahul 'bhaiya' par kiye gaye kataaksh se bahan priyanka kaa aahat hona lazimi tha, kyonki 'maa ke liye beti kuch bhi karegi, bhai ke liye bahan kuch bhi karegi', to aise main modi yah bhi jaanate honge ki bhai par unke nishane se bahan ko bhai ke liye kuch karne kaa 'avasar' milegaa
 
 
 In the election time, this opportunity is only for the counterattack of statements, so is Modi very cleverly giving this 'opportunity' to Priyanka to keep speaking continuously and continue the process of retaliation, so that this 'trump card' of Congress Try to bring it into a straight fight of politics and try to beat it
 
 
 ? Priyanka was already hurt by Modi's attack on her husband Robert Vadra
 
 
 is babat bayaan bhi diya or ghotaale ke aarope se ghire apane pati kaa bachaav bhi kiya
 
 
 When Priyanka was asked a question on the controversy surrounding her daughter, she replied, "I am Rajiv Gandhi's daughter"
 
 
 ab jo 'beti maa ke liye kuch bhi karegi', vah pita ke liye bhi to 'kuch bhi karegi'
 
 
 Narendra Modi must have been aware of this as well
 
 
 aise main divangat pita ko nishane par lekar modi ne priyanka ko uksaane kii koshish kii
 
 
 It was Rahul's statement in which he called Modi a politician of anger
 
 
 palatwaar ke dauraan gandhi parivaar ko gussell sabit karne ke liye narendra modi baat ko gandhi parivaar kii pichhali teen pidiyon tak le gaye
 
 
 For example, he mentioned Rajiv Gandhi's anger at the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Sonia's anger at Sitaram Kesri and PV Narasimha Rao and Rahul's anger at ordinances related to tainted leaders
 
 
 zaahir he, isse priyanka ko bhi gussa aayaa
 
 
 Then immediately came the answer
 
 
 "inhone amethi kii dharti par mere shahid pita kaa apmaan kiya he
 
 
 The people of Amethi will never forgive this act
 
 
 inaki 'neech raajnneeti' kaa jawaab denge
 
 
 The answer will come from each booth in Amethi
 
 
 " Now in this statement, 'harkat' and 'despicable politics', these two words are stinging
 
 
 'neech raajnneeti' kii baat modi ko chubh gai, lekin unhone 'neech raajnneeti' kii tohamat ko 'nichi jati' kii haisiyat se jodakar apana kad bada karne kii koshish kii
 
 
 Votes will be cast in Amethi on 7 May
 
 
 so, amethi kii janata ne 'badla nahin, badlaav ke liye' vot diya yaa gandhi parivaar ke prati apni bhaavnaatmak yathasthitwaad ke liye, iskaa pitara 16 may ko khulegaa
 
 
 Many people were also speculating that the Congress will take revenge for Modi's threat in Amethi in Benares
 
 
 khabar yah bhi chal padi ki priyanka gandhi prachaar ke liye banaras jaaengi, jabaki anaupchaarik baatcheet main priyanka pehle hi bataa chuki hai ki banaras ke congressi ummidavaar ajay raay kii taraf se bulaava tha, lekin unka vahaan jane kaa koi iraadaa nahin
 
 
 But when the media has an eye on the face, a verbal war can be fought from anywhere
 
 
 vaise, fasebuk par ek dilachasp coment padhane ko mila - "amethi ek hi bhai-bahan se pareshaan he
 
 
 Now other siblings have also arrived

 Antila security guards told the police that two men had descended from the Swift Dzire car

 The constitution bench of five judges has reserved a decision in the matter of giving 10 to 30 per cent incentive marks for government doctors working in remote / hilly areas for admission to postgraduate medical courses in the state
 MCI ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki rajyon ke paas is tarah kaa koi adhikaar nahin he ki wo sevarat doctoron ko is tarah kaa kota de
 This will weaken the provision of merit and these facilities are only for PG Diploma
 centre ne bhi is kota kaa virodh kiya he or kaha ki rajya ko ye adhikaar nahin
 This quota is illegal

 isamen bataaya gaya he ki kai kaarnon se rajya kai varshon se or kai saalon se seva pradaan karne vaale ummidavaaron ke liye 50% rajya kota ke aarakshan ke pattern kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 Even in 50% this list can be prepared by providing incentives for service in difficult, rural or remote areas
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki yah samvidhan kaa ulanghan he kyonki shaharon main kaam kar rahe doctoron or doordaraj ke kshetron main kaam kar rahe doctoron ke bich bhedbhaav karata he
 He demanded the cancellation of the rules so that admission could be done only on the basis of NEET marks
 yachikaaon main post graduate medical ajukeshan regulation ke viniman 9 (4) or (8) kii vaidhata ko chunauti di he jo in sevaaon ke liye doctoron ko aarakshan pradaan karte hai
 Incentives are offered to such candidates from 10% to a maximum of 30% of the marks obtained for each year's service in the National Eligibility-less Entrance Examination in remote and / or difficult areas or rural areas

 It states that for many reasons, states are following the pattern of reservation of 50% state quota for candidates who have served for many years and for many years
 yahaan tak ki 50% main yah suchi mushkil, gramin yaa doordaraj ke ilaakon main seva ke liye protsaahan pradaan karke taiyaar kii ja sakati he

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray visited the Mahalaxmi temple to visit Goddess Ambabai and started a political campaign
 bhari bheed ko sambodhit karte hue fadanvis ne vipaksh par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 56 inch seene vaale bayaan ko lekar tanj bhi ksaa
 He said, 'we decided to have an alliance and even split the ticket, but what about the opposition? He says that they are all 56 parties, but to win elections, you do not need 56 parties, 56 inch chest is needed
 'fadanvis ne shivasena ke saath apni party ke samjhaute ko "hindutvvaadi" gathbandhan ke rup main ullekh kiya jo jati, dharm or bhashaa se pare he
 Referring to Sharad Pawar's Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), he said, "also, there is nationalism in our DNA instead of our name
 " sattarudh bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ne 48 siton par 25 : 23 ke anupaat main apane-apane ummidavaar khadey karegi

 The Lok Sabha elections will be held in 7 phases across the country, which will start from 11 April and will run on 19 May
 matganana kii taarikh 23 may he
 In an alliance, two things are most important, one is who will be the leader of that alliance and second, which party will contest in the coalition in how many seats and what will be its formula
 jahaan tak bihar kaa sawaal he, pehle sawaal kaa jawaab to khud BJP ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kuch dinon purv yah kahkar de diya tha ki janata dal united (jediu) ke saath gathbandhan atal he or BJP nitish kumaar ke netritv main hi aglaa vidhansabha chunaav ladegi
 But on what the formula will be on the seat synergy, BJP says that now they expect Nitish Kumar to make an announcement on their behalf
 jaise BJP ne unhen netaa maanakar apana dil dikhaaya he, nitish kumaar siton ke samjhaute par apana bada dil dikhaaenge
 This is to say of Bihar BJP President Sanjay Jaiswal
 haalanki jaisawal ne ek baat to spasht kii he ki koun sa dal kitni siten ladega ye aakhirkaar jediu kii taraf se nitish kumaar or BJP kii taraf se amit shah mil baithkar hi tay karenge jaisaa ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan dekha gaya or yah vishay rajya ke netaaon kii paridhi se baahar he
 But it is believed that Sanjay Jaiswal has given this statement to the mood of his party's central leadership on this subject, because two days before the statement of the party's national president Amit Shah, Sanjay Jaiswal gave a statement in Bhagalpur in which He had said that the NDA is unbreakable and whatever statement Union Minister Giriraj Singh makes is his personal opinion
 jahaan tak party ke stand kaa sawaal he to jo bhi party ke adhikrut pravaktaa bolen use hi party kii raay mana janaa chahie
 This statement was seen as an indication that the party has distanced itself from Giriraj Singh's statements targeting Nitish Kumar and is currently excluded from campaigning for coalition religion
 jabaki giriraaj singh ne apane loksabhaa kshetra begusarai main pichley kai dinon se party ke kaaryakramon main sakriy hai
 But this statement of BJP leader Sanjay Jaiswal is being directly understood that the party wants that as it has decided on equal number of seats in the Lok Sabha, Nitish Kumar will now have equal number of seats in the assembly elections as well
 Give your consent to the principle of fighting
 BJP netaaon kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa ne gathbandhan dharm ke liye jab nitish kumaar ke maatr 2 saansad jite hue the tab apane kai nivartmaan saansadon ko tikat se bedagal kar 17-17 kii barabari ke formule ko apanaaya tha or khud nitish kumaar ne pichley vidhansabha main rajd ke 22 vidhayakon ke baavjood baraabar-baraabar ke siddhant ko apanaate hue chunaav ladaa tha
 Therefore, the formula of Nitish Kumar has also been adopted for his ally and BJP for JDU
 isliye is baar isi formule ke aadhaar par siton kaa bantwaaraa ho aisa BJP chaahati he

 lekin badali paristhiti main jab BJP ne bhi apane sanghathan kaa vistaar kiya he or centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar he aise main uskaa maananaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main barabari-barabari ke siton ke samjhaute ko nazarandaaz karnaa nitish kumaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) a bench headed by Justice SC Dharmadhikari was hearing a petition filed by Phantom Films, the producer of "udta Punjab"
 nirmaataa board kii samiksha samiti ke aadesh se asantusht hai jisane film ke 17 june ko pradarshan se pehle usamen badlaav karne kaa suzav diya he
 Justice Dharmadhikari compared the "udta Punjab" on narcotics addiction to another previously released film, "go, Goa Gone", in which the film depicts the situation in Goa where people try to mingle with the party
 Go and take banned drugs
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòyadi goa ko us film main drug ke durupyog ke sthal ke rup main dikhaaya ja saktaa he to ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô main punjab ko dikhaane main kya buraai he
 The counsel for the censor board argued that the review committee's suggestion to make 13 changes to the film is not arbitrary and the committee has set its mind while making this suggestion
 vakil ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòham punjab evam uske logon ke sandarbh tathaa film main istemaal kii gai bhashaa ko lekar aapatti kar rahe hai
 Hearing the arguments, the court said that it is not satisfied with the two suggestions given by the censor board
 in sujhaavon main samiti ne chandigarh, amritsar, tarantaaran, jashanpura, moga evam ludhiana jaise sthanon kaa sandarbh hataane ko kaha he
 Regarding other suggestions of the review committee, the counsel for the censor board said that he would give his arguments in this regard on Friday
 iske baad adaalat ne maamle ko taal diya
 However, advocate Ravi Kadam of Anantrag Kashyap's production company Phantom Films said that the order was issued randomly and is arbitrary
 unhone kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòpunjab avadharana kaa abhinn ang he tathaa ise film se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Kashyap said separately that he felt that he was being blackmailed in his entire battle with the censor board to get a certificate for 'udta Punjab'
 unhone kaha ki pehle kabhi bhi board yaa sarkaar ke saath unke jhagadon main unhone kabhi yah mahasoos nahin kiya ki unhen chup kiya ja rahaa he, lekin yah maamla alag he
 While opposition parties in Punjab are accusing the ruling Akali dal-bjp of using their influence to curb 'udta Punjab', Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal said the government had nothing to do with the film
 And it is a matter between the filmmakers and the censor board
 badal ke virdohi or punjab congress ke adhyaksh amarinder singh ne kaha ki unhone ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô ke nirmaataaon ko patr likhakar anurodh kiya he ki 17 june ko ise amritsar main relies karne ke liye isaki bina sensor vaali sidi unhen muhaiyaa karaaen
 The comments kashyap ko basapa adhyaksh mayawati kaa samarthan mila jinhone kaha ki ‚Äòudata punjab‚Äô main kuch galat nahin he or party iskaa samarthan karti he
 On the other hand, after Ashok Pandit, another member of the censor board, Chandramukh Sharma also came out against the functioning of its chief Pahlaj Nihalani and said that he would request him to go to the government and change the name of CBFC to 'PRO of government' Say

 kuch aisa hi hua fatehabad ke bhatu kii rahane vaali sonia ke saath
 Who had a love marriage to a young man named Sultan of Ambarsar village in Narwana 23 days ago against the wishes of his family
 darasal, sonia or sultan 22 oktober ko shaadi karne ke baad gudgaanv main rahane lage the
 After 22 days, suddenly the victim's brother-in-law Pravin reached Gurgaon and pleaded with both of them to stay in the village
 sonia ne devar or pati kii baat maan lee or uske saath unke paitruk gaanv amabarsar chalane ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 But Sonia did not realize that death awaited her on the way
 jaise hi vah amritsar belarkha road se guzarati bhakhdanaharake paas pahunchi, vahaan uskaa sasur ishwar pehle se hi intjaar kar rahaa tha
 In fact, Sultan, Praveen and Ishwar had already planned to kill Sonia
 aropiyon ne sonia ke sir main eent maari or phir use nahar main dhakel diya
 After that, the three returned to their homes, considering Sonia dead
 udhar, nahar main phenki gai sonia eent ke waar or nahar main girane ke baavjood bhi jinda batch gai
 She somehow managed to come out of the canal by holding bushes somehow
 police ke mutabik sonia sabase pehle ek hotel main pahunchi, jahaan se usne police ko ghatana kii soochna di
 When the police arrived on the spot, Sonia heard the tragedy
 iske baad police ne sonia ke bayaan ke aadhaar par aaropee pati sultan, devar praveen or sasur ishwar ko giraftaar kar liya
 The police admitted the injured Sonia to the hospital
 jahaan uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he

 bihar main 'mahagathbandhan' ko lekar mahamanthan ke daur jari hai
 The alliance has two issues - Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress
 mahagathbandhan ko lekar congress lalu prasad or jithan ram maanjhi ke saath he, vahiin party ke kuch netaa ishaaron-ishaaron main nitish kumaar ko saath lene kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 This 'nitish Prem' of the Congress leaders is not coming to Lalu's two Lals, ie, Tejashwi and Tej Pratapko
 ise bhaanpate hue congress phoonk-phoonk kar kadam uthaa rahi he
 According to sources, Congress in-charge for Bihar, Shakti Singh Gohil, has advised the party leaders who speak in favor of Nitish Kumar to keep their mouths shut
 rajya se congress ke kuch netaaon kii ore se nitish ke paksh main bole jane par argedy ne aapatti jaahir kii thi
 After this, the Congress directed its leaders not to make rhetoric
 bijepi se nitish ke alag hone par hi badhegi baat: sutaracongress sutron ke mutabiknitishabijapi ke saath khud ko sahaj nahin mahasoos kar rahe hai, lekin jahaan tak mahagathbandhan main unhen saath lene kaa sawaal he to is par vichaar sirf unke bijepi se naata todane kii surat main hi kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also certain that the Congress cannot resent its loyal ally RJD at the expense of Nitish
 darasal, nitish ne jis tarah pehle bijepi se naata todakar argedy or congress ke saath gathbandhan kar bihar kaa pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav jeeta or phir kaarykaal ke bich main hi palati maarthe hue bijepi se dobaaraa haath mila liya, is saare ghatnakram ne nitish kii vishwasaneeyata par sawalia nishaan lagaaya he
 On the other hand, Lalu has stood firmly in the difficult times of the Congress
 argedy se rishte thik karne ko nitish khud karen pahalsutron kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar kii taraf se aane vaale sanketon par congress ne saaf kiya ki nitish ko pehle argedy se baat karke apane rishte thik karne kii pahal kerani hogi, congress usee ke baad is disha main koi kadam uthaaegi
 According to Congress sources, Nitish must first separate himself from the fascist BJP
 bihar ke liye congress prabharee shakti singh gohil kaa kahana he, 'nitish aaj bijepi ke saath hai, isliye un par 'no coment' hi congress kii line he
 But why Nitish left the Grand Alliance and went with the BJP, it will tell the time to come
 aakhirkaar bijepi netritv kii blackmel or dabaav kii raajnneeti sab jaanate hai, nitish kis vajah se gaye, ye bhavishya hi batayega
 Yes, i can say this much that Nitish is very unhappy with the BJP on the lines of the rest of the NDA allies
 'congress ko madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh main jeet kii askul milakar congress aaj ke nitish ko majaboor or kamjor maanati he, isliye bhavishya menmahagathbandhanamen wo saath aate hai to isse usko aitraaj nahin he
 However, the party also believes that it is the responsibility of Nitish to remove the resentment of RJD about Nitish
 sutron ke mutabik congress is saal ke aakhir main madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon par nazren gadaaye he
 If Congress gets success in elections in these states, then the basis of politics with Hanak will be decided for it
 nitish centre kii raajnneeti main, bihar main tejasvi ke tilak kaa formula?congress sutron ke mutabik, agar sab kuch thik disha main chalaa to congress nitish ko 2019 ke baad centre kii raajnneeti main aakar bihar main tejasvi kaa tilak karne kaa formula de sakati he
 After all, the Congress is ready to form the biggest grand alliance to defeat Modi in Bihar, that too in Bihar where he himself is a junior partner
 philhal abhi ye sab dur kii kaudi he

 a special CBI court in Ghaziabad issued bailable warrants against Noida doctors Rajesh and Nupur Talwar in the aarushi-hemraj murder case
 adaalat ne is aadesh ke saath hi magistrate ke samaksh danpati ke nijee taur par pesh hone se chhot maangane sambandhi unki yachika ko khaarij kar diya
 Rajesh and Nupur were directed by Special Judicial Magistrate Preeti Mishra to appear in the court
 unhone sibiai kii closer report ko khaarij karte hue talwaar danpati ko hatya, saboot nasht karne or aparaadh karne kii saajha ichha rakhane kaa aaropee banaaya tha
 On the other hand, in another development, the Talwar couple has claimed in the affidavit in the Allahabad High Court on Monday that several facts were revealed during the investigation which have been ignored by the special CBI court
 talwaar danpati ne apane halafname main daawa kiya ki chah november 2008 ko kiye gayi diene pareekshan ke nishkarsh main bataaya gaya tha ki unke ghar kii chat, ghar main paayi gayi whisky kii bottle or ek anya naukar krishna ke takiye par paye gayi anguliyon ke nishaan ek hi vyakti ke the or nishchit taur par yah vyakti purush tha
 In the petition presented in the CBI court, Rajesh Talwar had sought exemption from personal appearance citing medical reasons, while Nupur had pleaded privately in court in Allahabad High Court pending the same murder case
 a waiver was demanded
 danpati ne sibiai kii vishesh adaalat dwaara unhen jari saman ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay main chunauti di thi
 The High Court, which began hearing the matter on 25 February, had refused to impose any stay against the CBI court order
 talwaar danpati ke vakil satish tamata ne kaha, ‚Äòsibiai kii adaalat ne rajesh or nupur kii yachika ko khaarij karte hue unke khilaaf bees-bees hajaar rupaye ke jamaanti warrant jari kiye
 The court has now ordered him to appear on 22 March
 ‚Äôtamata ne kaha, ‚Äòelahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne aaj unki yachika par sunwaayee kii lekin apana faisla kal ke liye surakshit rakh liya
 He said, Rajesh is not medically fit and has been advised to rest and he cannot walk without help
 yachikakartaon ne ucch nyaayalay main kaha tha ki is tathy ke baavjood unhen saman jari kar diye gayi hai ki jaanch agency ne apni closer report main unhen aaropee nahin banaaya he
 Aarushi (14) was found dead at her residence in Noida near Delhi on the night of 15-16 May 2008, while the body of house servant Hemraj was found on the roof of the house a few hours later
 haalanki sibiai ne rajesh se narko pareekshan tathaa brain masping sahit vyapak poochtacha kii thi lekin jaanch agency ne rajesh yaa unki patni nupur ko is varsh daakhil apni closer report main aaropee ke taur par pesh nahin kiya tha
 The Talwar couple also alleged that they were banned from accessing Aarushi's computer while they submitted an application under the Information Technology Act
 is computer ko sibiai ne jaanch ke liye jabt kar liya tha
 The Talwar couple asked that they be given access to the computer to find out who might have switched off the router which is necessary for access to the Internet
 15 may 2008 ko router us samay chaalu avasthaa main paaya gaya tha jab aarushi apane kamare main mrit paayi gayi thi
 The Talwar couple also said that apart from this no evidence was found against Aarushi's mother Nupur
 ucch nyaayalay main talwaar dampati ke vakil gopal chaturvedi ne tark diya ki yadi mukademe ke dauraan hatyakand main unke khilaaf koi saboot saamne aata he, to adaalat dand prakriya samhita kii keval dhara 319 ke tahat nupur ke khilaaf kaarywahi kar sakati he
 Talwar's claim made by CBI counsel Nazrul Islam Jafri last Friday that the investigating agency had no right to oppose the plea, saying that the CBI was not a party to the case and was merely a court Is presenting arguments in this case to help
 yachikakarta ke purv main kiye gayi is daawey par ki adaalat ne unke khilaaf galati se mukadmaa chalaane kaa faisla kiya he jabaki tathy yah he ki sibiai ne apni closer report main unhen sandigdh qaraar nahin diya tha, jaafaree ne kaha, ‚Äòyadi jaanch agency ke nateezon se koi nyaayadhish sahamat nahin hai to vah is sambandh main koi bhi faisla karne ke liye swatantra hai
 Jafri also cited the statement of Umesh Sharma, the driver of the Talwar couple, in which he said that he had seen about nine-and-a-half Aarushi at the dinner table with the Talwar couple on 15 May 2008
 apane bayaan main talwaar dampati kii naukaraani bharti ne kaha tha ki agali subah saadhe chah baje usne danpati ko us samay jagaaya jab aarushi ne darwaja khatkhataye jane kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 Nupur opened the door with the key that he had on it
 jaafaree ne kaha, ‚Äòisse sabit hota he ki aarushi kii hatya umesh ke talwaar danpati ke ghar jane or rosemara ke kaam nipataane ke liye bharti ke aane ke bich hui
 Meanwhile, the Talwars are responsible for proving what happened
 ‚Äô The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that it will hear the petition of the Campa Cola flat owners on 6 January
 yachika main court ke pichley aadesh ko waapas lene kii maang kii gai he, jisamen unhen manjuur yojana kaa ulanghan kar nirmit flaton ko khaali karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi before the court bench said that those living in the flats described as irregular have already paid the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation a fine for regularizing the structure
 is par nyaayamurti echel daatu kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne chah janvari ke liye soochibaddh karne kaa aadesh diya
 The court was told that the Municipal Corporation came to know about the payment of the fine under a question asked under the Right to Information Act (RTI)
 adaalat se kaha gaya ki pichhali sunwaayiyon main yah soochna uplabdh nahin thi
 Assembly elections are likely in Maharashtra in October
 Electoral activism of all parties including BJP has to be increased between the BJP and Shiv Sena
 The seat-sharing of the political parties has increased as the assembly elections in Maharashtra come close
 bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah bhi beete ravivaar ko sholapur main raily kar chunavi maahaul garma chuke hai
 But the decision on the seat-sharing with the Shiv Sena has not been done yet
 gathbandhan main barabari ke formule ke tahat shivasena bijepi se baraabar siten chaahati he
 However, after the removal of 370 from Kashmir, the confident BJP is not in favor of giving equal seats to the Shiv Sena due to the atmosphere created in its favor across the country
 party netaaon kaa maananaa he ki bijepi akele chunaav ladakar bhi sarkaar banane kii kshamta rakhti he
 Maharashtra elections are likely in October
 yahaan bahumat kaa aankada 145 siton kaa he
 The last time the BJP contested alone in the 2014 election was 122 seats
 sitting emele kii siton par nahin hoga samjhautabijepi ke sutara bataate hai ki bhartiya janata party(bijepi) maharashtra kii 123 siton par kisi tarah ke samjhaute ke mood main nahin he
 Similarly, BJP does not want to take the seats of 63 mlas present with Shiv Sena
 is prakaar kul 288 vidhansabha siton vaale maharashtra main shesh 103 siton par bijepi 50:50 ke anupaat main bantwaaraa karnaa chaahati he
 If that happens, BJP will get more than 170 seats
 haalanki sutara bataa rahe hai ki is formule par shivasena aasaani se sahamat nahin hogi
 Alternatives to fight alone Also during the tour of Maharashtra, all the top BJP leaders have instructed the state unit to prepare to contest all the seats
 ravivaar or somvaar ko maharashtra daure par rahe bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi meeting ke dauraan sabhi siton par apni taiyaari chust-durust rakhane ko kah chuke hai
 Before this, be it BJP general secretary Saroj Pandey or executive chairman JP Nadda, who also visited Maharashtra, they have also made a strategy for preparing the party for 288 seats
 isse sanket milte hai ki bijepi akele chunaav ladane ke vikalp ko bhi khulaa rakhana chaahati he
 Actually, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance was broken in 2014 due to seat sharing and some other differences
 donon dalon ne tab akele chunaav ladaa tha
 In such a situation, the BJP is running with the option of preparing in advance for any situation

 is par deepika ne kaha, swara film kii shuruuaat main chalaa disclemur padhanaa bhul gayi
 The biggest thing is that the film is of old times

 In a recent interview, when Swara was asked, you thought that there would be so much ruckus on it, she said that i was i had no idea at all
 jab unase open letters main prayog kii gai bhashaa or shabd par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone jawaab diya, mujhe nahin pataa tha ki jo shabd maine letters main likhaa, wo angreji main 'V' se or hindi main 'ya' se shuru hota he

 The batting of Cheteshwar Pujara and opener Mayank Agarwal, who were the reason for the historic Test series victory on Australia tour, was calm

 At the same time, if we talk about the Windies, there are a lot of concerns for him

 english boltevakt akasar hamase aisi galtiyaan ho jaati hai jinaki taraf ham kai baar dhyaan hi nahin dete
 The main reason for these mistakes is that we do not know the exact word
 yahaan ham aapako bataa rahe hai aise shabdon ke istemaal ke niyam joinglish kii aam bolchalauralikhanemen istemaal kiye jate hai
 These words sound similar but they have different meanings
 1
 Its and it's: Often people get confused in its and it's while writing
 iske liye aap ek sidhaa sa niyam yaad rakh lenditsek possessive pronoun he jaise my, your, his, ours, yours, theirs
 It is also used like these pronoun
 aap isko is udhaaharan se samaj sakate hai
 The puppy played with its toy
 It‚Äôs, it is kaa contraction he
 If you cannot understand it, then you can understand the sentence by writing it separately
 It‚Äôsko ek vaakya main subject or helping varb ke rup main bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example i thinkit's going to rain or i thinkit isgoing to rain
 2
 Whose and Who's: Whose is the possessive pronoun of Who,
 jiskaa istemaal akasar kiskaa / kiske ke arth main hota he
 You can think of it as Whose money did he take? That is, whose money was it for? Who's who is a contraction
 aap Who is ko alag-alag karke bhi is vaakya ko samaj sakate hai
 who's can be used as a subject and a helping verb in a sentence
 udhaaharan ke liye who‚Äôs going to clean the house or Who is going to clean the house
 3
 To or Too:to kaa istemaal pripojishan or noon ke taur par kiya jaataa he jaise i am going to the store, We want to help
 That too means there too
 yah also kaa paryaayavachi shabd he
 At some places, it comes before Adjective and Adverb, where it is used for much more
 jaise i am too tired yaa i ate too much
 That means i am too tired or i have eaten too much
 4
 Lose and Loose: Often people do not understand the difference between lose and loose
 Lose ek varb (kriya) he jiskaa matlab hota he khona, ganvaana, peeche ho janaa, haarana, chuknaa, chhodana
 You can understand this with this example- i do not wish to lose my money

 'he further wrote,' In the Dahi Handi pyramid, small children are offered in the top three to four stones and when the falls fall, children suffer serious injuries
 iske chalate kai ki mrityu ho jaati he to kai aapng ho jate hai
 You (maneka Gandhi) should order the Maharashtra government to either ban it completely or do not participate in child gopals for 12 years
 gauratlab he ki kuch dinon pehle hi in sab maamalon ko lekar maharashtra bal sangrakshan ayog ne 4-12 saal tak kii umr ke bacchon ke dahi handi main bhaag lene par paabandi laga di thi

 really shameless In the Barkatullah University of Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, their classmates who protested against the molestation of students, were beaten up by their students
 faraar manachale yuvakon kaa ab tak suraag nahin laga he
 After the gang-rape of a girl in a moving bus in Delhi, the Madhya Pradesh government and the police have come into action, but the incidents of molestation and rape of young women in the state are not taking its name
 rajdhani bhopal main manchalon ne vishvavidhyalay parisar main chaatraon se chhedchhad kii
 Upon receiving information about the molestation of female students, the classmates thrashed these students when they reached for rescue
 vishvavidhyalay parisar main kaaphi der tak hangaamaa chalata rahaa, magar bich-bachaav karne koi aage nahin aayaa
 Many students have also suffered injuries
 vishvavidhyalay ke mahila adhyayan centre kii pro
 Asha Shukla expressed grief over the molestation incident and demanded to provide security to the students opposing the molestation
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhartiya janata party kii prachand jeet ne virodhiyon main khalabali machaa di he
 Particularly, the main opposition party, the Congress, seems to have a greater impact of defeat
 rashtriya str par jahaan khud party adhyaksh rahul gandhi apni jimmedaari chhodane ke liye ade hue hai, vahiin rajyon main bhi halaat takaraar vaale najar aa rahe hai
 Despite the government in Rajasthan, the Congress is not able to win even a single seat and the crisis in the politics has deepened and the Congress leaders are appearing in rebellious mode
 is bich congress ko samarthan de rahe bispi vidhayakon kii rajyapal se mulaakaat kii charchaa ne bhi siyasat garmi di he
 In such a situation, questions are also arising whether there can be some vicissitudes in the politics of Rajasthan
 ye sawaal isliye bhi kyonki congress ke andar se to bagawati sur uth hi rahe hai
 On the other hand, the discussion of the meeting of the mlas supporting the Congress standing at the mouth of majority has also given rise to these fears
 haalanki, is puure ghatnakram ko congress ke apane netaaon ne hi janm diya he
 Uday Lal Anjana, a minister in the Gehlot government, has questioned the distribution of tickets for the worst defeat in Rajasthan in the Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan tak ki anjana ne yahaan tak kah diya ki ashok gahalot ke bete vaibhav ko jodhpur loksabhaa seat se chunaav nahin ladanaa chahie tha
 At the same time, Uday Lal also believes that the Congress should have aligned with Hanuman Beniwal's party, due to which the BJP formed an alliance
 udai laal ke bayaan ke alaava ashok gahalot or dipti siem sachin payalat ke bich kii duriyon ko bhi congress kii haar se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 However, the party is denying this
 bispi vidhayakon ne machaai khalabalisomvaar ko bahujan samaaj party ke 6 vidhayakon ke rajyapal se milane kii khabar ne bhi siyaasi sargharmiyon ko hawa dene kaa kaam kiya
 The news has come that all the BSP mlas supporting the Congress government will meet in the evening
 haalanki, baad main bispi vidhayakon ne is mulaakaat ko radd kar diya
 Raj Bhavan said that this meeting has been canceled by the mlas and no reason has been given for this
 haalanki, bispi vidhayakon kaa saath chhodana bhi gahalot sarkaar ke liye musiibat khadi nahin kar saktaa he
 The Congress has 100 members in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly with 200 seats
 jabaki 6 bispi vidhayakon ne use samarthan diya he
 Apart from this, Independent mlas also have support for Gehlot Government
 bataa den ki rajasthan main kul 13 nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 While there are 6 others
 vahiin, pramukh vipaksh dal bijepi ke paas mahaj 73 vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, even though the chances of the Gehlot government's coup are slim, the Congress leaders are losing their opposition due to the Congress not getting any one of the 25 seats after taking over the state power five months ago
 yahaan tak ki mantri kataaria ke istife tak kii bhi charchaa ho rahi he
 On this discord of the Congress, BJP state president Madan Lal Saini said that the Congress had made false promises to farmers and youths, which had an impact in the Lok Sabha elections
 agar kuch karne kaa jajba aapke man main he to duniya kii koi bhi takat aapako nahin roak sakati

 Whoever goes to Sai Ram's shelter does not come empty at his rate
 baba ko man se yaad karo to wo saare sankat dur kar dete hai
 Eliminate every trouble with the recitation of this chalisa: In the first twilight steps, i will offer my head
 kaise shiridy sai aae, sara haal sunaauun main
1
koun he mata, pita koun he, ye na kisi ne bhi janaa
 Where was the birth Sai made a riddle, question riddle? Someone said of Ayodhya, this is Lord Ramchandra
 koi kahata sai baba, pawan putr hanuman hai
3
koi kahata mangal murti, shri gajanand hai sai
 Some say Gokul Mohan, Devaki Nandan is Sai
 4, Shankar, many consider the devotees to be worshiping Baba
 koi kah avatar dutt kaa, puja sai kii karte
5
kuch bhi maano unako tum, par sai hai sachche bhagwaan
 Very kind Deenbandhu, donated life to how many, many years ago event, i will tell you
 kisi bhaagyashaalee kii, shiridy main ai thi baraat
7
aayaa saath usee ke tha, balak ek bahut sundar
 Came, came and settled there, made the holy Shirdi city wandering for eighty days, he asked for alms
 or dikhaai aisi lila, jag main jo ho gai amar
9
jaise-jaise umr badi, badhati hi vaise gai shaan
 In the city, there was a house-to-house, Sayin Baba's praises echoing in the 10‡••dig, and then Sayin Ji's name
 deen-dukhi kii raksha karnaa, yahi rahaa baba kaa kaam
11
baba ke charnon main jaakar, jo kahata main hum nirdhan
 His mercy would be on that, the bond of unhappiness would be opened
 12 Nobody ever asked for alms, two Baba children
 evamastu tab kahkar sai, dete the usko vardaan
13
swayan dukhi baba ho jate, deen-dukhijan kaa lakh haal
 Finally, a huge devotee of Shri Sai came like a sea, a madrasi came, very rich in the house
 maal khajaana behad uskaa, keval nahin rahi santan
15
laga manaane sainath ko, baba mujh par dayaa karo
 To Naiyya, who is troubled by the storm, you cross me
 16‡•• In a dark, capped house without a lamp
 isliye aayaa hum baba, hokar sharnaagat tere
17
kuldeepak ke abhaav main, vyarth he daulat kii maaya
 Today, Baba, i come to you as a beggar, take shelter, give me son and charity, i will be indebted all my life
 or kisi kii aashaa na mujhako, sirf bharosa he tum par
19
anunay-vinay bahut kii usne, charnon main dhar ke sheesh
 Then Baba, being pleased, gave this blessing to the devotee, ‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§æall good will your son be born in your house
 krupa rahegi tujh par uski, or tere us balak par
21
ab tak nahin kisi ne paaya,sai kii kripaka paar
 Blessed with the son Ratna Madrasi, the world that is sent to him with the mind of the world, salvation is in the world
 saanch ko aanch nahin hai koi, sadaa jhooth kii hoti haar
23
main hum sadaa sahare uske, sadaa rahoonga uskaa das
 As Sai has found God, is it so short? Is there a day like this 2424, i do not get bread
 tan par kapadaa dur rahaa tha, shesh rahi nanheen si langoti
25
sarita sanmukh hone par bhi, main pyaasa kaa pyaasa tha
 Sometimes i used to rain down on me, Davagni
 In addition to the 26 world, i had no support
 bana bhikhaari main duniya main, dar-dar thokar khaataa tha
27
aise main ek mitra mila jo, param bhakt sai kaa tha
 Freed from the flames, but he was with me in the world, for the vision of Baba, both of them thought
 sai jaise dayaa murti ke, darshan ko ho gaye taiyaar
29
paavan shiridy nagar main jaakar, dekh matvaali moorati
 Blessed to be born that, when we have seen Sai's sunrise since 3030, we have seen all the misery
 sankat saare mitai or, vipadaaon kaa ant ho gaya
31
maan or sammaan mila, bhiksha main hamako baba se
 Reflected in the world, we have been honored by Sai Baba's aura, in this life
 iskaa hi sambal le main, hansata jaaoongaa jivan main
33
sai kii lila kaa mere, man par aisa asar hua
 347 'kashiram' Baba's devotee used to live in Shirdi, as it was filled in every particle of the world
 main sai kaa sai meraa, vah duniya se kahata tha
35
sikar swayan vastra bechata, gram-nagar bazaaron main
 Junkrit was his heart mechanism, Nisha was awestruck in Sai's jingles, he slept, moon stars in Rajni Aanchal
 nahin sujhata rahaa haath ko haath timir ke maare
37
vastra bechakar laut rahaa tha, hai! haat se kaashi
 The strange coincidence that came that day, the lonely 3838 people stood in the way, calling him unjust
 maaro kaato looto isaki hi, dhwani padi sunai
39
lut petakar use vahaan se kutil gaye champat ho
 He was deeply touched by the trauma, he lost the noun, he remained there for a long time, in the same condition
 jane kab kuch hosh ho uthaa, vahiin uski palak main
41
anjaane hi uske munh se, nikal padaa tha sai
 Whose resonance was heard in Shirdi, Baba was awakened
 lagata jaise ghatana sari, ghati unheen ke sanmukh ho
43
unmaadi se idhar-udhar tab, baba lege bhatakane
 Whatever happened, all the things that came, bursting into them, and in blazing coals, Baba put them on
 hue sashankit sabhi vahaan, lakh tandavanrity niraala
45
samaj gaye sab log, ki koi bhakt padaa sankat main
 All the aggrieved were standing there, but in awe of amazement, for the sake of saving them, Baba is today very worried
 uski hi pidaa se peedit, unki ant:sthal he
47
itane main hi vividh ne apni, vichitrataa dikhalaai
 Having written the one whom the public, reverence sarita waved, 4848, to a nounless devotee, the car one came there
 sanmukh apane dekh bhakt ko, sai kii ankhen bhar ai
49
shant, dheer, gambhir, sindhu-sa, baba kaa ant:sthal
 Today, do not know why it would have become intermittent, today it was 5050 today, the idol of mercy itself, was made remedial
 or bhakt ke liye aaj tha, dev bana pratihaari
51
aaj bhakt kii visham pariksha main, safal hua tha kaashi
 For the sake of his own vision, the city-dweller gathered up to 52, whenever and wherever a devotee was in trouble
 uski raksha karne baba, aate hai palabar main
54
yug-yug kaa he satya yah, nahin koi nai kahani
 When the distressed devotee used to go, the priest himself was of humanity, beyond the antidote 555
 jitne pyaare hindu-muslim, utane hi the sikh isai
56
bhed-bhav mandir-misjad kaa, tod-phod baba ne daalaa
 Rah Rahim all belonged to him, echoed by Krishna Karim Allatala 5757 hours, the corner of the mosque
 mili paraspar hindu-muslim, pyaar badha din-din duuna
58
chamatkaar tha kitna sundar, parichay is kaaya ne di
 And even in Neem Kaduwahat, sweetness Baba filled up all the love to 59 Sai, loved everyone balanced
 jo kuch jisane bhi chaha, baba ne usko vahi diya
60
aise snehashil bhaajan kaa, naam sadaa jo japa kare
 No matter how sad the mountain is, in a moment she shied away, as the donor, we did not see anyone
 jiske keval darshan se hi, sari vipadaa dur gai
62
tan main sai, man main sai, sai-sai bhaja karo
 After you have lost your body, you should do it with care
 63 ‡§∏‡•Å When you will remember your mind, you will remember Baba
 or raat-din baba-baba, hi tu rata karegaa
64
to baba ko are! vivash ho, sudhi teri leni hi hogi
 Baba will have to fulfill your every wish
 65‡•• Jangal, do not go wild in the wild, and seek Baba
 ek jagah keval shiridy main, tu paaegaa baba ko
66
dhanya jagat main praani he vah, jisane baba ko paaya
 In sorrow, in happiness, there are eight poles, the quality of Sai is sung
 Mountains of great distress, even if lightning breaks down
 sai kaa le naam sadaa tum, sanmukh sabake raho ade
68
is buudhe kii sun karamat, tum ho jaaoge hairaan
 Stunned to hear that, who knows how clever Sujan was once in Shirdi, someone came to see him
 bholi-bhali nagar-nivasee, janata ko tha bharamaaya
70
jadi-bootiyaan unhen dikhaakar, karne laga vah bhaashan
 Listen listeners, the house is mine, Vrindavan, 71, i have one, and astonishing power
 iske seven karne se hi, ho jaati dukh se mukti
72
agar mukt hona chaaho, tum sankat se beemaari se
 So, my humble request is to buy 73 lakhs from every male, from every woman, its intake methods are unique
 yadhyapi tuchh vastu he yah, gun uske hai ati baari
74
jo he santati hin yahaan yadi, meri aushadhi ko khaae
 Get the son-jewel, he will ask for the fruit; 75‡•• whoever does not buy me, will regret for life
 mujh jaisaa praani shaayad hi, are yahaan aa paaegaa
76
duniya do dinon kaa mela he, mouj shauk tum bhi kar lo
 If you get everything from it, you should take it too
 pramudit vah bhi man hi man tha, dekh logon kii naadaani
78
khabar sunaane baba ko yah, gaya daudkar sevak ek
 Hearing this, Bhukruti stretched and, having forgotten all the conscience, gave the servant, hold the jewel and bring the wicked
 yaa shiridy kii seemaa se, kapati ko dur bhagaao
80
mere rahete bholi-bhali, shiridy kii janata ko
 Who is such a low who dares to cheat, to trick such a creepy, insidious looter all over the world
 mahanash ke mahagart main pahunchaa, duun jivan bhar ko
82
tanik mila abhas madari, krur, kutil anyaayi ko
 Kaal dances now on the head, Angry Sai stops all the games throughout the year, runs on his head
 soch rahaa tha man hi man, bhagwaan nahin he ab khayr
84
sach he sai jaisaa dani, mil na sakegaa jag main
 Sayin Baba of Ansh Ish, wearing him or her in the difficult world of 8585 snake, modesty, courtesy etc
 badhata is duniya main jo bhi, maanav seva ke path par
86
vahi jeet letaa he jagat ke, jan jan kaa ant:sthal
 His sadness makes the world awake, when the weight of sin in the world increases
 use mitaane kii hi khatir, avtari hi aata he
88
paap or anyaay sabhi kuch, is jagati kaa har ke
 In the moment, the avatar Sai came to death in the death of the world, fleeing the demon for a moment
 samta kaa yah paath padhaayaa, sabko apana aap mitaakar
90
naam dwarka masjid kaa, rakhaa shiridy main sai ne
 Eradicated heat, heat, shock, whatever came, Sai used to sit in remembrance of Mast Ram, Sai
 pahar aath hi ram naam ko, bhajte rahete the sai
92
sukhi-rukhi taaji basi, chaahe yaa hove pakwaan
 Sauda was hungry for love, all for the sake of love and reverence
 bade chaav se us bhojan ko, baba paavan karte the
94
kabhi-kabhi man bahalane ko, baba baag main jate the
 He was a happy nature, happy in the merry mind, of the 95-color floral garden, dim-wobbly
 behad viraane man main bhi sneh salil bhar jate the
96
aisi sumdhur bela main bhi, dukh apaat, vipadaa ke maare
 Hearing the agony of his heart, listening to Baba while he was alive, he was filled with a lotus, Nayan Kamal
 de vibhuti har vyathaa, shanti, unke ur main bhar dete the
98
jane kya adbhut shakti, us vibhuti main hoti thi
 On the forehead, which used to bear sorrow, all the pain was taken
 dhanya camel kar unke jinase, charan-camel ve parasaae
100
kaash nirbhay tumko bhi, saakshaat sai mil jaataa
 Chaman, desolate for years, would blossom again today, i would catch the Charan Shri, not leave my life
 manaa letaa main jarur unako, gar ruuthate sai mujh par

 He said that it is justified to impose Public Safety Act (PSA) on 80-year-old Farooq Abdullah
 supreme court main sunwaayee se ek din pehle sarkaar ne ravivaar ko rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or neshnal conference ke netaa faruk abdulla ko piese ke tahat hiraasat main liya
 Furious at the government's action, Asaduddin Owaisi said whether the central government was scared of Farooq Abdullah
 80 saal ke bujurg par itane kade act lagaaya janaa yah sabit karata he ki vahaan par sthiti gadabad he or sab kuch sahi nahin chal rahaa
 He further said that the Prime Minister meets Abdullah and suddenly he becomes a threat to the country
 'ab kya kahenge amit shah'ovaisi ne kendriya grih mantri kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki amit shah ne sansad main kaha tha ki abdulla ko na pakadaa gaya he or hiraasat main liya gaya he
 Now what will he say on this? abdulla or masarat alam ko ek hi category main rakhaa gaya he
 He said that the government is lying
 sarkaar har cheez ko chupaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Why is former Jammu and Kashmir CM Ghulam Nabi Azad needing to seek permission from the government to go there

 a person detained under the Public Safety Act can be detained without trial for up to 2 years
 rajyasabha saansad or purv mukhyamantri faruk abdulla pichley maheene 5 agast se house arest hai
 But the former Chief Minister has been booked under the PSA a day before on Sunday

 shahzad ne twitor par likhaa, 'agar congress netritv kii ore se sardaar patel ko apamaanit kiya gaya tha to mujhe bhi aaj kuch vaisaa hi apamaanit mahasoos ho rahaa he
 When i raised my voice to end dynastic politics
 maine adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav kii baat kahi thi na ki rahul gandhi kaa virodh kiya tha
 But on behalf of the Congress it was said that i am not a member, i proved that they are lying
 'if Sardar Patel was insulted by Congress leadership back then, then i feel the same way today
 When i raised my voice to end dynasty politics & election for pres post &, not coronation of Rahul Gandhi, then they (congress) said i was not a member

 He has praised Maharashtra Congress leader Shahzad Poonawala for questioning dynasty
 piem modi ne manch se kaha ki shahzad ne shahjade ko lekar sawaal uthaae to unki aawaaj ko dabaane kii koshish kii gai
 Even Shahzad was removed from the social media group
 piem ne kaha ki ye kis tarah kaa tolerance he
 In fact, Shahzad Poonawala had recently raised questions about the election of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi as the President
 unhone saarvajanik taur par kaha tha ki sirf rahul gandhi hi kyon congress ke adhyaksh ban sakate hai
 After this question of Shahzad, his elder brother and Robert Vadra's relative Tehsin Poonawala also opposed Shahzad
 yahaan tak ki tahseen ne twitor par shahzad se apane rishte khatm karne kaa elaan kar diya tha
 Please tell that Tehsin is a relative of Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra
 is masale par vivaad ke baad ravivaar ko piem modi ne gujarat main surendranagar kii raily se ek baar phir is mudde ko uthaaya
 The special thing is that this comment of PM Modi has come at a time when all preparations to make Rahul Gandhi the party president in the Congress have been completed and he is going to nominate on December 4
 isse pehle hi modi ne ye mudda uthaa diya
 He taunted that where there is no internal democracy, no one can work for the people
 a youngster Shehzad has exposed the rigging that is taking place in the Congress President Poll
 And Shehzad is a senior Congress leader in Maharashtra
 Congress has tried to muzzle his voice and wants to even remove him from their social media groups
 What tolerance is this: PM‚Äî BJP (@ bjp4india) December 3, 2017 Shahzad You showed great bravery PM Modi praised Shahzad Poonawala from the stage
 unhone kaha ki, 'shahzad tumne bahut bahaduree dikhaai he, lekin afsos he ki congress main hameshaa aisa hi hua he
