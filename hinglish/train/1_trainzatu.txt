 Rating: 3 Star Artist: Bipasha Basu, Emraan Abbas and Mukul Devdirector: Vikram Bhattakritcher 3D Bipasha Basu and Director Vikram Bhatt have already said that it is not a horror movie but a creator based
 film main kuch aisa hi dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 It is a film crafted by some Indian tradition and imagination
 jisamen halkaa-sa horer kaa put daal diya gaya he
 Vikram Bhatt is trying out the 3D format from his last few films, and has also been successful
 aisi hi koshish krichar main bhi he
 If the length of the film had been reduced a bit and the story would have been a bit more logical then it could have become a bang movie
 lekin bipasha basu kii acting or technology kii vajah se film kahin-kahin acchhee lagati he
 Anyway, Vikram has started a new trend by daring like this
 kahani main kitna damafilm ko himachal pradesh kii khubasurat vaadiyon main shoot kiya gaya he
 Ahana (bipasha) opens a lodge in the middle of the forest in Himachal
 log bhi khub aate hai, lekin tabhi ek brahmarakshas in jangalon main aa jaataa he, or apni bhukh mitaane ke liye shikaar karne lagata he
 Ahana's lodge also comes under the target of Brahmarakshas
 phir kahani shuru hoti he ahaana ke apane astitv ko bachaane or brahmarakshas se ladane kii
 Often the weakness of Indian directors has been that they are unable to maintain the subject on which they are raised
 lay tut jaati he
 Romance and not-knowing-what-is-a-matter-of-the-way things make the film lame
 aisa vikram ke saath bhi hua
 They should have shown more than Bipasha and Kreacher
 kahani ko or dilachasp banaaya ja saktaa tha
 Star Appalibipasha is now known as the horror queen in Bollywood
 pichley kuch samay se ve aisi hi filmein kar rahi hai, jo bollywood kii anya heroine shaayad haath bhi nahin daalana chaahe
 Bipasha has expressed her boldness with such decisions, and has also mastered such films
 film main unke seens main khub majaa aata he
 The expressions on his face are also fun
 haalanki imran ke saath unki chemistry jamati nahin he
 Mukul Dev is fun and interesting
 kamai kii batek aisa darshak varg bhi he jo is tarah kii filmon ko dekhte hue zyada tarkon main nahin ulajhata he or vah parade par hone vaali har ghatana kaa majaa lene main yakeen karata he
 a couple of songs from the film are also good
 film ko dekhne masej hi aane vaali he or isamen isi tarah kaa masala bhi he
 Creature is a film made for small towns and single screen theaters
 vaise bhi viman lead vaali filmon ko pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the third film based on Heroine after Mardaani and Meri Kaum in the last four weeks
 ab baari bipasha kii he! Terror funding coming from Pakistan to the valley was exposed on camera by 'aaj Tak' sting 'operation Hurriyat'
 is oparation ke baad jaanch agency NIA ne teror funding ke maamle main hurriyat netaaon kii giraftaar bhi kii he
 At the same time, due to the sting operation, there has also been a huge decline in the stone pelting in the valley
 hurriyat par nakel kasne ke baad se hi patharbaajon tak paisa nahin pahunch paa rahaa he or isi vajah se ghati main patharbaji kam hui he
 Let me tell you in a systematic way how the Pak sponsored stone pelting has been tightened in the valley
 1
 In the sting operation of 'aaj Tak', Hurriyat leaders were shown on camera confessing about Pak funding
 iske baad NIA ke adhikariyon ne espi str ke 8 adhikariyon kii ek team banaakar kashmir main pakistan kii funding kii jaanch shuru kii
 2
 sting 'oparation hurriyat' ko dekhne ke baad hi aatankwaad or aatanki ghatnaon par najar rakhane vaali jaanch agency enie ne turant hi praarambhik jaanch kaa maamla darj karte hue badi karrwai shuru kar di
 The NIA first initiated an investigation against Naeem Khan, Bitta Karate, Javed Baba, Hafiz Saeed, among others who confessed to hawala funding from Pakistan on 'aaj Tak' camera
 3
 When the NIA found strong evidence in this investigation in which the direct relations of the Hurriyat leaders started meeting with the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Chief of the let, the NIA started the investigation by registering an FIR after a written order from the Home Ministry
 yah FIR jamaat-ud-daawa ke chif hafiz said, hijbul mujahiddeen, dukhtaraan-e-millat, hurriyat conference sahit duusare agyaat logon ke khilaaf darj kii gai
 4
 FIR ke mutabiq hawala ke jariye hurriyat conference ko paisa mil rahaa he
 The FIR states that the Central Government has received information that the Hurriyat Conference is taking money from Pakistan through several illegal and hawala channels, in connivance with the Hizbul Mujahideen, lashkar-e-taiba and other terrorist organizations, which are used to keep the Kashmir Valley in trouble
 Is for 5
 Sources have revealed that a team of women, led by separatist women leader Asiya Andrabi, seduce school and college students
 agency kaa maananaa he ki patharbaji main chaatraon ko shaamil karne ke liye in mahilaon ko paise die jate hai
 The FIR of the investigating agency has named Hafiz Saeed, Hurriyat Conference members, Hizbul Mujahideen, lashkar-e-taiba and dukhtaran-e-millat as accused
 FIR main kai bade naam aane ke baad hurriyat netaaon par tabadatod chaape or poochtacha kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 6
 enie ne uske baad 3 june 2017 ko badi karrwai karte hue jammu-kashmir or dilli sahit alag-alag shaharon main kareeb do darjan jagahon par chhapemari kii jisamen enie ko kai chaunkaane vaale dastavej mili the
 According to information from NIA sources, on the basis of these documents, the NIA has interrogated separatist leaders like Naeem Khan, Bitta Karate, Javed Baba, Sahid ul Islam, Altaf Funtus dozens of times in Delhi
 7
 Now 7 main accused are in the custody of NIA
 court ne 10 aropiyon kii remanj par bhej diya he
 In the coming times, the NIA will tighten its grip on big Hurriyat leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani
 NIA sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabiq NIA pehle charan main pakistan kii taraf se hone vaali funding kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The investigation will be completed in the next several stages
 8
 There has been a huge reduction in stonewalling in Delhi amid interrogation of Hurriyat leaders in Delhi
 algaavvaadi netaaon par aarope lagate rahe hai ki vah patharbaajon ko 500 or 1000 rupye dekarek din ke liye patharbazikarate the
 Now, after paving the way for Pakistan funding, the funding from Pakistan is not reaching these stoners
 isi vajah se patharbaji kii ghatana ko patharbaj anjaam nahin de paa rahe hai
 9
 suraksha agenciyon ke aankade saaf bataate hai ki is saal 1 june se lekar 11 julai tak 44 aatanki dher hue phir bhi patharbaji kii koi badi ghatana nahin hui
 According to the information received by 'aztak', in 2016, whenever the security forces took action against the terrorists, for several days, the stonemasons started throwing stones to help the terrorists
 lekin is saal ek june se lekar 11 july tak 44 aatanki maare gaye or patharbaji kii chhitput ghatnaayen hi ghati hai
 10
 pichley saal 8 july ko burhan vaani kii maut ke baad 3 maheene tak ghati main patharbaji hui thi
 Thousands of security agencies were injured in stone pelting last year, but this year, since the nia's investigation, Pakistani funding has come under control
 saath hi hurriyat netaaon ke khilaaf jaanch se patharbaji kii ghatnaon main kami ai he
 DG CRPF has said in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that there has been a significant reduction in the number of stones this year compared to last year
 'oparation hurriyat' par puche sawaal par diji CRPF ne kaha ki jis tareeke se enie in patharbaajon ke aakaaon ko giraft main le rahi he uske baad se aisi patharbaji kii ghatnaon main kami ai he
 Apart from this, new methods were used by CRPF to prevent stone pelting, that strategy has also curbed it
 is saal ab tak 424 patharbaji kii ghatnaayen hui he jabaki pichley saal is samay tak kahin zyada patharbaji kii ghatnaayen hui thim
 On the manner in which 16 youths raised slogans of Pakistan Zindabad in Gaya district of Bihar 2 days ago, senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi has said that the Grand Alliance government in the state looks as if Bihar wants to make Kashmir
 2 maheene pehle bhi patna kii sadakon par vivaadit islamic dharmaguru jakir nayak ke samarthan main jamkar pakistan ko samarthan ke naare lage the or uske 2 din baad hi bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke grih jile nalanda main pakistani jhanda laharaaya gaya tha
 Sushil Kumar Modi has questioned the intention of Bihar government regarding all these incidents
 susheel modi ne twit kar likhaa, 'in tatwon kaa dussahas itnaa bad gaya he ki yah ek taraf jakir nike ke samarthan main pakistan jindabad ke naare lagaate hai vahiin duusari taraf pakistan kaa jhanda bhi laharaate hai
 Even during the puja, these elements attacked the immersion procession '
 modi ne kaha ki aise tathyon par kaarywahi nahin kar ke bihar sarkaar pakistan samarthakon ko badhaava de rahi he or sawaal uthaaya ki kya mahagathbandhan sarkaar bihar ko kashmir bananaa chaahati he? mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se sawaal karte hue modi ne poocha ki aakhir kyon bodhgaya or patna main hue aatanki hamalon ke abhiyukton ke khilaaf ab tak spidi trial nahin shuru hua he?modi ne janata dal united par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki pakistani aatankwaadi david hedli kii gavaahi main aatanki sabit hone vaali ishrat jahaan kaa majahab dekhakar jediu use kuch vakt pehle bihar kii beti bataa rahi thi vahi aaj yah party bhopal jail se faraar hue 8 simi ke aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane par aansu baha rahe hai
 Sushil Modi tweeted, "religious party politicians can beat any of SIMI terrorists killed by calling them Bihar's son", Modi said RJD President Lalu Prasad and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Bhopal encounter By raising questions, morale of security agencies are breaking
 modi ne kaha aise rajanetaaon ke aarope galat unki sampatti japt kar unhen deshadroh kanoon ke tahat dandit kiya janaa chahie

 aap campitent (yogya) hai, isliye aapke liye job ophers kii bhi kami nahin hogi
 You can leave the job whenever you want, looking at your career, but for many people there may be more reasons behind leaving any job
 lihaaja jab aap job chhod rahe hon yaa kisi kaaran se chhot rahi ho, to aapako in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he: While leaving the job, do not leave your image negative in the company or organization in which you are working
 isse aage chalakar vaapasi main pareshaaniyaan hongi
 Do not break contact with the boss of the old company, they can be helpful in your growth
 isliye jab job chhoden to, bos ke liye ek 'happy note' jarur chhodkar jaaen
 If you are running in a notice period, try to give your best still
 rejignation dene ke baad bhadda vyavhaar na karen
 One is that your image is damaged due to bad behavior, secondly the company can take action against you, you cannot get NOC or release letter
 rejignation dene ke baad company kii property kaa usee tarah care karen, jis tarah se pehle karte aa rahe the
 Do no harm
 aapane company se jo kuch bhi apane naam se ishyu karavaaya he, use nishchit taur par waapas karen
 Never try to take what you do not have in the company with you
 kai companiyaan apane yahaan kiye hue kaam (project, data aadi) ko le jane kii ijaajat nahin detii he
 So do not forget to handover your data
 apane eczit intervyuu main graticude jaahir karen, chaahe greevans kitna bhi kyon naho
 Do not be angry
 kalig yaa imploi kii buraai karne se bachein
 Leave your colleagues politely before leaving office
 saare gile-shikave dur kar len
 By doing this you will leave with a good image
 job chhodte samay apane future plan ke bare main adhik baat na karen yaa jis nai company main ja rahe hai, vahaan ke bare na bataaen, ho saktaa he ki koi aapako nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kare
 So when you are leaving the job or are missing for some reason, then you need to keep these things in mind: job chhodte vakt jis company yaa sanstha main aap kaam kar rahe hon, vahaan apnichhavi nakaaratmak bana kar na jaaen
 This will lead to difficulties in return later
 puraani company ke bos se sampark na toden, ve aapke growth main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 So when you leave the job, definitely leave a 'happy Note' for the boss
 yadi aap notice period main chal rahe hai,prayaas karen ki aap tab bhi apana best den
 Do not behave lewdly after giving a registration
 ek to bure vyavhaar ke kaaran aapaki chhavi karaab hoti he, duusari baat yah ki company aapke khilaaf ection le sakati he, aapako NOC yaa relies letters nahin mil saktaa he
 After giving the registration, take care of the property of the company in the same way as before
 koi nuksaan na pahunchaaen
 Whatever you have issued in your name to the company, definitely return it
 company main jo cheez aapaki nahin he use apane saath le jane kii bhi kabhi koshish na karen
 Many companies do not allow their work (projects, data etc
) to be carried out
 isliye apane data handover na karnaa bhoolen
 Show gratitude in your exit interview, no matter how greven it is
 gussa jaahir na karen
 Avoid doing evil of the collar or the employee
 offis chhodane se pehle apane sahakarmiyon se vinamrata purvak vidaa len
 Take away all the grievances
 aisa karne se aap ek acchhee chhavi lekar vidaa honge
 While leaving the job, do not talk too much about your future plan or the new company you are going into, there may be someone trying to harm you

 And they are going to hand over this document to the SIT investigating the case
 is ghatnakram se aisi sansani faili ki bhopal se dilli tak bhartiya janata party hill gai
 Even speculation started till the resignation of Shivraj
 uske baad rajyapal ramanaresh yadav ke khilaaf isi maamle main exiar darj hui or unke istife kii atakalein bhi tej ho gayi
 Then came the day on 25 March when the death of his son Shailesh Yadav, accused of the Vyapam scam under mysterious circumstances in Lucknow, heightened the political sensitivity of the scandal that had been in the news since 2013
 lekin do maheene ke bheetar hi phijaan badal gai
 On 24 April, when the Madhya Pradesh High Court considered the contents of a pen drive from the Delhi High Court as 'prima facie' fake, Shivraj Singh Chauhan stumbled and said that all the allegations of Digvijay were fake and got a clean chit in the Vyapam scam
 is
 to kya saikadon medical siton or sarkari niyuktiyon main farjivade se judevyapam ghotaale ko shivaraj ke upar siyaasi bam kii tarah phenkane kii digvijay kii koshish naakaam ho gai he? jis ghotaale main shivaraj sarkaar ke purv shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma jail main hai or jisamen kendriya mantri uma bharti or khud digvijay singh kaa naam bhi uchhal chukaa ho, vah maamla itnaa sidhaa bhi nahin he
 What happened in the court was that the hard disk of Nitin Mohindra's computer, the main accused in the scam, was replaced between the seizure and production in the court
 isi badlaav main bhartiyon main sifarish karne ke vaale ke taur par jahaan-jahaan mukhyamantri kaa naam likhaa tha, vahaan rajyapal, uma bharti or anya mantriyon kaa naam daal diya gaya
 Digvijay Singh made this claim through a software expert from Indore who was initially helping the STF and police in investigating the case, but later became Whistle Blower
 hard discs main chhedchhad ke sakshya do jagah jamaa kiye gaye
 Digvijay Singh gave a bundle of evidence to the SIT investigating the case
 udhar, isi tarah ke dastavejon ko pandeya ne yah kehete hue march main dilli hycourt main jamaa kara diya ki madhya pradesh main uski suraksha ko khatra he
 Since the hearing of the case is going on in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, the Delhi High Court sent a pen drive with evidence to the Madhya Pradesh High Court
 esaity ne 24 april ko adaalat main rakhi apni report main kaha ki 'pratham drushtya' pen drive main maujuud saamagree farji pai gai
 That is, the evidence which was submitted directly by Prashant Pandey has come to the opinion of SIT and this opinion is not final yet
 nau may ko maamle kii phir sunwaayee hogi
 At the same time, the investigation of the papers given by Digvijay Singh to SIT is still on
 esaity ke pramukh chandresh bhushan ne apane bayaan main yah baat saaf bhi kar di, "hamane sirf pen drive kii saamagree par apni pratham drushtya report di he
 The documents given by Digvijay Singh are under investigation
 "siyasat par asarlekin is nukte se mukhyamantri shivaraj ke utsaah par koi fark nahin padaa
 After all, he did not celebrate even after becoming the Chief Minister for the third time in October 2013 as Vyapam's betel hounded around him
 kabhi unke pie, kabhi unke rishtedaar, kabhi unki patni or ant main to khud unheen par aaropon kii kaalikh lagaai gai
 None of these allegations were proved in the court, but Shivraj's future was at stake after the matter was presented directly to the court of Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat made a surprise announcement on Tuesday during the release of a book in Delhi that India is a Hindu nation
 bhagwat ne ghoshnaa kii, 'ham sabakuch badal sakate hai
 All ideologies can be changed, but not just one thing can be changed, that 'india is a Hindu nation'
 ' hindutv kaa zikr karte hue aresas pramukh ne hanuman, shivaji or aresas ke sansthaapak keshav baliram headgavar ke naam ek saans main liye
 Despite the claims of the Hindu Rashtra, when the head of the institution talks on homosexuality, it seems that the RSS is engaged in changing its serious image
 bhagwat ne kaha ki is mudde ko charchaa ke jariye suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 He said, "the Mahabharata has been an example in ancient armies, not in the Vedas
 ' yah pehla mauka nahin he, jab bhagwat ne samalangita par sangh ke rukh main badlaav ke sanket die hai
 He said during the three-day grand event 'future of India - RSS Vision' in 2018, that he is gay and the society needs to change over time
 bhagwat kaa adhikansh bhaashan aresas ke ek udaar chehre ko pesh karne par tha, lekin unhone asahmati ke mahatv par jor diya
 He said, 'we can have differences here, not discrimination
 'vahiin pitiai kii report ke mutabik aresas dwaara kisi ‘vaad' par chalane kii baat se saaf inkaar karte hue iske pramukh mohan bhagwat ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya ki sanghathan main ek hi vichaardhaara satat rup se chalati chali aayi he ki jo ‘bharat bhoomi kii bhakthi' karata he, vahi ‘hindu' he
 The Sarsangh Chalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) said this at the Lokaparna ceremony of the book 'the RSS: Roadmap for 21 Century' by Sunil Ambekar, a senior campaigner associated with ABVP
 sangh dwaara maatr hinduon kii baat karne ke daavon kii ore paroksh karte unhone ne kaha, ‘hamane hindu nahin banaae
 They have been going on for thousands of years
 desh, kaal, paristhiti ke saath chale aa rahe hai
 He said that if any person who considers India as his motherland and loves him, then the Hindu is still alive
 bhagwat ne kaha ki bhashaa, panth, praant pehle se hi hai
 Even if someone has come from outside, there is no problem
 hamane baahar se aae logon ko bhi apanaaya he
 We consider everyone our own
 unhone kaha, ‘ham desh, kaal, paristhiti ke anuroop apane main badlaav laae hai lekin jo bharat bhoomi kii bhakthi karata he, bhartiyata purna rup main use viraasat main mili he, vah hindu he
 
 yah vichaardhaara sangh main satat rup se bani hui he
 There is no confusion in this
 ' Very upset with the adjournment of the Rajya Sabha, the BJP has said that the government does not have a majority and it ran away even before the Rajya Sabha got voting
 saath hi unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ne satta main rahane kaa rajnatik or sanvaidhanik adhikaar kho diya he
 On the other hand, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley attacked the government and said that since the Parliament of India has been formed, no one has given such a huge deception to the Parliament
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jo sarkaar voting se bhaagti he
 He does not have the right to remain in government
 ye sarkaar kii naitik haar he

 Take out old clothes that will cover your entire body
 jitna kam rang sharir par lagegaa, chhudaana utaana hi aasaan hoga
 2
 sharir kaa jo hissaa khulaa ho us par cold kriim yaa phir tel laga len
 Oily skin will not be able to freeze the color and will be easily left
 3
 If you are going to get out in the sun on Holi day, then apply waterproof sunscreen to avoid tanning
 sanscream se twachaa naa keval tanning se bachegi balki rang bhi nahin chipakegaa
 Know why and how Lattmar Holi plays in Barsana

 Drinking sufficient amount of water keeps the skin moist

 So keep drinking water

 While playing Holi, we take care of the body but forget the lips and ears
 hothon or kaanon par lip balm yaa vaseline laga lenge to donon surakshit rahenge or koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 Not India, it is celebrated here as the biggest Holi in the world! If any part of the body is getting irritated or jealous while playing Holi, immediately pour cold water at that place

 a woman stole her own car in the capital Delhi
 usne chori bhi kii aisi-waisi jagah se nahin, balki police kii naak se neeche se
 It may be surprising to hear, but it is true
 darasal, bijness karne vaali 29 saal kii ek mahila ne dilli ke chandani chowk jaise bheedbhad vaale ilaake main 'no parking jone' main apni car khadi kar di
 Traffic police took his car with him when he violated the traffic rules openly
 baad main trephic police ne car ko dilli police ke paas jamaa karvaa diya
 Carmilla, standing in the wrong place, stole his confiscated car, showing 'impulse'
 jabt kii gai car prakriya puri hone tak police kii sampatti maani jaati he
 The incident is dated July 12
 dilli police ke adhikari ne bataaya ki mahila ne apni car ko chandani chowk ke toun haul ke baahar khadi kii thi
 From there, the car was pulled from the crane and taken to the old police line
 usee jagah par sabhi jabt gadiyon ko rakhaa jaataa he
 The car was pulled from the crane and, according to police, the woman arrived there about 20 minutes after the car was brought and started inquiring about her car
 kuch hi der main usne apni gaadi khoj lee
 The woman started sitting on the driving seat of her car very comfortably
 jab vahaan maujuud consteble ne usase kaha ki vah is tarah bina fine jamaa karaae car nahin le sakati, to vah gaali-galoch karne lagi
 After this, she got upset with the car
 is dauraan anya pulisavaale bhi vahaan maujuud the
 a constable even tried to leap and catch the vehicle, but he could not succeed in it
 police ko dhata bataakar nikal gai karboharhaal, mahila ke khilaaf dhara- 379, 186, 332 ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya he
 The car is registered under the name of Kajri Gupta
 police ko pataa chalaa ki bijness karne vaali vah mahila ek doctor ke ghar kiraye par rahati he
 As per information, the woman has never paid a rent to the doctor
 court ne use ghar khaali karne kaa aadesh diya he
 However, the police said that the woman was absconding, who was being searched
 police ko ummid he ki vah jald kii pakad main aa jaaegi
 Jai Shri Ram, speak with full force Jai Shri Ram
 kabhi jiske itnaa bolne ke saath hi kisi bhi sabha main ram naam kii ganga bahane lagati thi, josh se labalab kaaryakarta ayodhya main ram mandir ke model ko hi puure desh ke raamarajy kaa model bataane lagate the
 Today, the international president of the same Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), 'praveen Togadia', became permanently attached to the organization
 lagbhag 52 varshon ke baad hone vaale vihip ke chunaav main praveen togadiya gut ke ummidavaar raghav reddy ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Despite being in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad for 32 years, why today the organization gave Togadia three divorces
 darasal iske liye hamen pichley kuch mahino main hone vaali ghatnaon par ek najar daalani hogi
 Sometimes the disappearance of Togadia and sometimes speaking out against the government openly, the incidents were such that the tug of power with Pravin Togadia was becoming known
 modi virodh main pis gaepraveen togadiya kii vihip se vidaai ne aaj sangh parivaar ke bhitarkhaane chal rahi raajnneeti ko sataha par laane kaa kaam kiya he
 Today, the Sangh and its allied organizations appear to be divided in support and opposition of Narendra Modi
 ek netaa ke rup main aaj modi itane majboot ho chuke hai ki unke virodh kii gunjaaish dikhti nahin he
 That is why today Togadia had the same condition as Sanjay Joshi
 khulkar sarkaar kii nitiyon kii aalochana karnaa or use kisaan virdohi, hindu virdohi, yuva virdohi bataanaa hi inke vidaai kaa ekmaatr kaaran he
 No other instance of close friendship between Modi and Togadia was found soon
 sangh ke vichaaron ko donon ne gujarat ke har kone tak pahunchaaya
 Even after Narendra Modi joined the BJP, his relations continued
 jab apane rajya se hi modi ko raajnneetik vanvaas de diya gaya to gujarat main wo praveen togadiya hi the jinhone modi kii vaapasi sunishchit karne ke liye apane str par unka bharpoor sahyog kiya
 Why have Togadia, who once interfered in the BJP government of Gujarat, stood on the sidelines today? Actually the situation changed completely after the 2002 Gujarat riots
 kabhi modi kii raajnneetik chhavi main hindutv kaa chhaunk daalane vaale praveen togadiya ab narendra modi ke liye sabase badi dikkat kaa sabab ban rahe the
 The charges of rioting were leveled against the Modi government of Gujarat and the anti-muslim violence was being described as sponsored at the government level
 narendra modi ne apane aapako raajnneetik jeevandaan dene ke liye praveen togadiya, vihip or bajrang dal jaise sanghathano ke par kutarne shuru kar die
 Togadia has always been alleging that Modi made him a scapegoat to make his politics shine
 aarope to ye bhi lagaae gaye ki dangon main police kii goli se 300 hinduon ko maarane kaa paap gujarat sarkaar ne kiya or dangon ke pashchaat pachaas hajaar hinduon ko jail main daal diya gaya 
 According to Togadia's farmer and young lover Togadia, since 2004, the distance between him and Modi has increased greatly
 lekin togadiya ne kabhi bhi modi virodh ko logon ke saamne jaahir nahin hone diya
 In the last few months, the way they have come out openly against the government is going to harm both Modi and Togadia somewhere
 ram mandir, kashmir tak to sahi tha, lekin ab togadiya kisaan or yuvaaon ke mudde ko bhi bade jor -shor se uthaa rahe hai 
 First Sanjay Joshi is Togadia today, then who is next? Indeed, there is a strong attempt to retain the relevance of the Modi era within the BJP and the Sangh
 ab togadiya 17 april se anischitkaaleen upwas par baithne vaale hai to iskaa matlab he ki abhi raajnneetik taapmaana or badhane vaala he
 The RSS too cannot avoid questions this time
 sangh or bijepi ke kader ke bich main bhi ye sandesh to janaa tay he ki maujhuuda vaqt main ek vyakti kii chhavi aaj puure sanghathan par haaavee he
 *** mashhoor punjabi singer daler mehandi mujeec industry main apane andaaj ke liye jane jate hai
 Fans have been seen performing 'tara Ra Ra' on their songs for years
 lekin ab daler menhadi par bhi hariyaanvi singer sapana choudhary kaa rang chadh gaya he
 Or rather say, Daler Mehndi has tried to make a super hit by giving Punjabi touch to Sapna's hit style
 daler mehandi or sapana choudhary kaa gaanaa baawali tered 25 april ko relies kiya gaya he
 The entire song features Sapna Chaudhary's face and her Haryanvi style
 lekin ye puraa gaanaa daler mehandi kaa he kyonki is gane ke liriks, mujeec ko compoj daler mehandi ne kiya he
 But after listening to the song, this question definitely arises that why did Punjabi pop singers like Daler Mehndi need to capitalize on Sapna Chaudhary's fame
 ye gaanaa sunne main bhale hi acha or dekhne main mjedaar he, lekin isamen daler mehandi kaa wo jaadu gaayab he jiske sabhi diwane hai
 You can hear Ganadaler Mehndi below for a long time ruling the Punjabi industry and Bollywood
 bhale hi nae singrs kii bheed industry main rap banaate hue dikh jaae
 But even today a song of the voice of Daler Mehndi becomes an anthem
 aise main mana sapana choudhary aaj ke vakt kaa mashhoor cheharaa hai, lekin jis daler mehandi kii tarah gane kaa singrs sapana dekhte hai unhen kisi sapana choudhary kii jarurat nahin he
 The Baoli Tareed song is completely Haryanvi
 bas gane kii shuruyaat main punjabi bhashaa ko yuj kiya gaya he
 However, Sapna Chaudhary can be seen snorting on the signature step of Daler Mehndi
 gane ko nayaa experiment maanakar sune to thik he
 But the mistake of giving it a place in the playlist of Daler Mehndi's hit number is hardly a fan of Daler Paaji
 gane ko dekhakar ye jarur lag rahaa he ki nae jamaane kii res main khud ko shaamil karne ke liye daler paaji ne ek koshish kii he jo hit to he, lekin superhit nahin he
 There is a new twist in the controversy related to keeping government schools open when Christmas is celebrated on December 25, 'good Governance Day'
 modi sarkaar ne is masale par congress par palatwaar kiya he
 
 
 
 kyonki mantri bhi kabhi chaatra thim!ab centre kii bijepi sarkaar 1987 main tatkaaleen congress sarkaar dwaara jari kiye gaye ek circular ko saamne kar rahi he
 It said that the students of Navodaya schools cannot leave the school campus and go to their home until the government formally announces the holiday
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki chaatr anya sabhi chhuttiyaan awasaiya skool main hi manaayenge
 Opposition parties under the leadership of the Congress are raising their voice against the issue of the government's alleged order to keep the schools open on Christmas day
 congress ne sansad ko gumraah karne ke liye kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu tathaa maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar prastaav laane kii bhi chetavanee di he
 On the other hand, Venkaiah Naidu had said in Parliament that the agenda of the Congress party was fixed according to a 'family'
 unhone kaha ki logon ko is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran karne kii anumati nahin di jaaegi
 This is a sensitive issue
 gauratlab he ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne navoday vidhyalay, CBSE skool tathaa AICTE ko 25 disambar ko sushasan diwas ke rup main manaane ke liye alag-alag circular jari kiya tha
 However, the Union Minister had clarified that all participation would be voluntary and institutions do not need to keep the school open on Christmas day
 rajasthan sarkaar ne prastaav taiyaar kiya he ki rajasthan main ab sharaab pinaa he to gau seva bhi kerani padegi
 The Excise Department of Vasundhara Government of Rajasthan has made such a rule that whoever drinks alcohol will have to pay Gau Mata tax
 rajasthan sarkaar ne aabkaari vibhaag ke prastaav ko circular ke jariye cabinet main jari kiya he jiske andar yah prastaav he ki sharaab kii bikri par cou tex lagaaya jaae
 The proposal for this has been sent to the Finance Department
 finance department yah tay karegaa ki sharaab kii bikri par kitna cou tex lagaaya jaae
 The Vasundhara government of Rajasthan is raising huge funds for the cows to wash away the blot on their government due to the death of thousands of cows in Hingonia Gaushala
 rajasthan sarkaar ne sabase zyada aamadani vaale apane aabkaari vibhaag se poocha tha ki wo kis tarah se gau seva ke liye paise juta saktaa he
 From the sale of every bottle of liquor to the excise department, the government has sent a proposal to impose cow tax on every peg in bars and hotels
 sarkaar ne ise circular ke jariye cabinet main rakhaa he jahaan hari jhandi milti he to ordinance ke jariye rajasthan main lagu kiya jayega
 The proposal for this has been sent to the Finance Department
 sansadeey kaarymantri rajendra rathod ne kaha ki aabkaari vibhaag ke prastaav ko vitt vibhaag adhyayan karegi
 The final decision on the proposal will be taken by Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 isse pehle rajasthan main vasundhara sarkaar ne stamp duty par 10 se lekar 20 fisadi takagau kar lagaaya thajo abhi liya ja rahaa he
 Which is earning about 300 crores
 rajya ke kareeb 1600 gaushalaon ke 6 lakh gau dhan ko paise die ja rahe hai lekin gaushalaon se or paise kii maang uth rahi he
 Right now the stamp duty is being charged
 Currently, the tax is being levied on the stamp duty, the money is not being deposited to give grants to the cowsheds because the recession has reduced the registry of houses and recovery of cow tax
 Is decreasing considerably rajasthan main is saal chunaav hone hai or gaay kii seva ek bada mudda he
 The Congress is describing the BJP government as the murderous government of Gau Mata
 abhi halaat yah hai ki gaushalaon ko 60 fisadi raashi decilitre management fund se diya ja rahaa he
 Recently, the central government has reduced the funds given for cow services out of the disaster management by 90%
 gaushalaon ko anudaan nahin milane se rajasthan main sadhu sant kai baar pradarshan kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, it is the intention of the government that if liquor pargau mata is taxed in the state, then huge amount will come in the treasury for the grant of gaushalas
 sarkaar yah dikhaanaa chaahati he ki vah gau seva ke liye rajya main ek bada fund taiyaar kar rahi he
 However, this will shock the wine lovers as the prices of alcohol will rise

Devi Lal's legacy spoke of the tremendous tide of Tau Chaudhary Devi Lal in the politics of JJP Kingmakerhariyana of Chautala divided into two factions
 devilal kii party ne 1987 ke haryana vidhansabha chunaav main 90 main se 85 siten jitkar tahalaka machaa diya tha
 Devi Lal's political legacy was handled by his son Om Prakash Chautala and became the Chief Minister
 32 saal ke baad unki viraasat sambhaal rahaa chautaala parivaar do dhadon main bant gaya he
 While the INLD is commanded by Om Prakash Chautala and his younger son Abhay Chautala, nephew Dushyant Chautala is seen forming a separate party to prove that he will handle Devi Lal's legacy
 india today-exis maai india ke mangalvaar ko aae agsit pole ke mutabik bijepi ko 32 or 44 ke bich seat milti dikh rahi hai
 Whereas, the Congress is expected to get 30 to 42 seats, JJP is seen to have 6 to 10 seats and in others account 6 to 10 seats
 agsit pole ke anusaar is vidhansabha chunaav main inelo puri tarah se saaf hoti dikh rahi he
 Whereas JJP, separated from INLD, is seen in the role of Kingmaker

 While INLD is headed by Om Prakash Chautala and his younger son Abhay Chautala

 At the same time, Om Prakash Chautala and Abhay Chautala, who are heading the INLD, fielded candidates for a total of 78 seats in Haryana's Rann

 As the last phase of the election draws near, the Mamkhor village of Gorakhpur has come into the limelight one by one
 
 The Baazi Samajwadi Party was killed in the 2018 by-election in Gorakhpur, considered to be the stronghold of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 
 So now the pressure is on BJP and Yogi Adityanath to save this seat
 
 That is why BJP has fielded superstar Ravi Kishan Shukla of Bojpuri and Hindi films born in this soil
 ji haa, ravi kishan kaa puraa naam he ravi kishan shukla
 The Mamkhor village from which Ravi Kishan belongs is considered to be the village of Shukla Brahmins
 magar ye gaanv sirf ravi kishan shukla ke naam se hi mashhoor nahin he
 Rather, there is also the village of Sriprakash Shukla, the biggest gangster in the nineties in UP
 vahi shriprakash shukla jisaki upi main tuuti bolti thi
 And he came into the limelight when he took betel nut to kill the then Chief Minister Kalyan Singh
 lakhanu se kareeb 310 kimi dur gorakhpur kaa mamkhor gaanv loksabhaa chunaav main achaanak surkhiyon main aa gaya
 Because the connection of Bhojpuri superstar Ravi Kishan, who is contesting from Gorakhpur on a BJP ticket, has been joined by nineties gangster Sriprakash Shukla
 mamkhor pahunchate hi ravi kishan us mitti ko pranaam kiya, jahaan kabhi gangster shriprakash shukla kaa bachapan beetaa
 Because this Mamkhor soil connects Ravi Kishan Shukla's connection with gangster Sriprakash Shukla
 ittefaq se donon isi gaanv se taalluk rakhte hai
 On one side of Mamkhor village is Ravi Kishan Shukla who played the role of gangster in reel life
 to duusari taraf real life kaa gangster shriprakash shukla tha
 One gained worldwide recognition with reel life
 duusare ne aparaadh kii duniya main apni badshahath kaayam kii
 Everyone knows the story of Ravi Kishan
 magar bahut kam logon ko pataa he ki is chote se gaanv se nikalakar shriprakash shukla ne kaise jurm kii duniya main apni pahchaan banaai thi
 Sriprakash Shukla was the biggest don of UP in the 90s
 jiske naam se janata hi nahin balki police or netaa bhi tharathar kaanpane lagate the
 Newspaper pages were dyed every day with the same headlines
 ham baat kar rahe hai upi ke sabase khatarnaak mafia don shriprakash shukla kii
 Who established the secret of terror in the biggest state of the country
 koun tha shriprakash shuklashriprakash shukla kaa janm gorakhpur ke mamkhor gaanv main hua tha
 Her father was a teacher in a school
 vah apane gaanv kaa mashhoor pahalwaan hua karata tha
 In 1993, Sriprakash Shukla killed a man named Rakesh Tiwari who whistled after seeing his sister
 20 saal ke yuvak shriprakash ke jivan kaa yah pehla jurm tha
 After this he did not look back and he moved forward in the world of gory
 bangkok bhaag gaya tha shuklaupane gaanv main rakesh kii hatya karne ke baad police shukla kii talash kar rahi thi
 Understanding the seriousness of the matter, Sriprakash thought it better to leave the country
 or vah kisi tarah se bhaag kar bangkok chalaa gaya
 He lived there for a long time, but when he returned, he had made up his mind to make a place in the world of crime
 surajbhaan gang main shaamil hua tha shriprakashashriprakash shukla hatya ke maamle main vaanchit tha
 Police were searching for him here and he was roaming freely in Bangkok
 lekin paise kii tangi ke chalate vah zyada din vahaan nahin rah sakaa
 And he returned to India
 aane ke baad usne mokama, bihar kaa rukh kiya or soobe ke surajbhaan gang main shaamil ho gaya
 Shreeprakash Shukla, who rose from the murder of Shahi, became a name in the world of crime
 isi dauraan usne 1997 main rajaneta or kukhyat apradhi virendra shahi kii lakhanu main hatya kar di
 It is believed that all this happened at the behest of Shahi's opponent Hari Shankar Tiwari
 vah chillupaar vidhansabha seat se chunaav ladanaa chahta tha
 After this, how many cases of murder, kidnapping, illegal recovery and intimidation were written in the name of Sriprakash Shukla
 railway thekon par tha ek chhatra rajashriprakash shukla police kii pahunch se baahar tha
 His name was becoming bigger than that
 upi police hairaan-pareshaan thi
 The name was known but there was no photograph with the police
 kaarobaariyon se ugaahi, kidnaping, katl, dakaiti, purab se lekar pashchim tak railway ke theke par ecchhatra raaj
 This was his profession
 or iske bich jo bhi aayaa usne use maarane main jaraa bhi deree nahin kii
 So people were afraid of him even to the police

 The government had made up its mind
 lakhanu sachivalay main upi ke mukhyamantri, grahamantri or dijipi kii ek baithak hui
 In this, a plan was made to form a special force to deal with criminals
 4 may 1998 ko upi police ke tatkaaleen ediji ajayraj sharma ne rajya police ke behtareen 50 javaanon ko chhaant kar special task force (estf) banaai
 The first task of this force was - Shriprakash Shukla, Zinda or Murda
 police ke saath pehali muthabhedashriprakash ke saath police kaa pehla encounter 9 sitambar 1997 ko hua
 The police got the news that Sriprakash, along with three of his colleagues, was going to get a haircut in the salon at Janpath Market in Lucknow
 police ne chaaron taraf gheraabandi kar di
 But this operation not only failed but a policeman was also martyred
 is encounter ke baad shriprakash shukla kii dehshat puure upi main or zyada bad gai
 The police was barely visible
 Photo: STF personnel armed with AK 47s in white uniforms raided from Lucknow to Ghaziabad, Ghaziabad to Bihar, Calcutta, Jaipur and then went to the picture of Sriprakash Shukla
 idhar, estf shriprakash kii khaak chaan rahi thi or udhar shriprakash shukla apane kariyar kii sabase badi vaardaat ko anjaam dene upi se nikal kar patna pahunch chukaa tha
 Murder of the minister was done in Patna, Shriprakash Shukla shot dead the then Bihar government minister Brij Bihari Prasad outside Indira Gandhi Hospital in Patna on 13 June 1998
 mantri kii hatya us vakt kii gai jab unke saath security guard maujuud the
 He got down from his red light car when 4 miscreants armed with AK 47 started firing on him and escaped from there
 mukhyamantri ke murder kii supaareeis katl ke saath hi shriprakash ne saaf kar diya tha ki ab purab se pashchim tak railway ke thekon par usee kaa ek chhatra raaj he
 The case of the murder of the Bihar minister had not cooled down yet when the UP Police received a news that swelled the hands of the police
 shriprakash shukla ne upi ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri kalyaan singh kii supaari le lee thi
 The news of CM taking betel nut for Rs 6 crore was like a bomb fall for STF
 mobile servilans kaa istemalastf harakat main ai or usne tay bhi kar liya ki ab kisi bhi haalat main shriprakash shukla kaa pakadaa janaa jaruri he
 STF came to know that Sriprakash talks to one of his girlfriends in Delhi on mobile
 estf ne uske mobile ko servilans par le liya
 But Sriprakash became suspicious
 usne mobile kii jagah pisio se baat karnaa shuru kar diya
 But she did not know that the police had also kept her girlfriend's number on surveillance
 servilans se pataa chalaa ki jis pisio se shriprakash kol kar rahaa he, wo gajiabad ke indirapuram ilaake main he
 As soon as the news is received, the UP STF team immediately rushes to the location
 aise maaraa gaya tha shriprakash shukla23 sitambar 1998 ko estf ke prabharee arun kumaar ko khabar milti he ki shriprakash shukla dilli se gajiabad kii taraf aa rahaa he
 As Shriprakash Shukla's car crosses the Vasundhara Enclave, the STF team including Arun Kumar starts following him
 us vakt shriprakash shukla ko jaraa bhi shaq nahin hua tha ki estf uskaa peechha kar rahi he
 As soon as his car entered the deserted area of indirapuram, the STF team suddenly stopped the way by overtaking Sriprakash's car
 police ne pehle shriprakash ko sarender karne ko kaha lekin wo nahin mana or firing shuru kar di
 Sriprakash Shukla was killed in police retaliation
 or is tarah se upi ke sabase bade don kii kahani khatm hui
 After the death of Shriprakash Shukla, STF revealed during investigation that Shukla had friendship with many leaders and top police officers
 kai police vaale uske liye khabari kaa kaam karte the
 In return for which he used to get money from Sriprakash
 kai netaa or mantri bhi uske sahyogi the
 The name of a UP minister was associated with him several times
 vah tatkaaleen mantri ab jail main band he
 Intelligence investigations of several officials and leaders were also conducted in this case
 police ne kharche kiye the ek karodmafia don shriprakash shukla apane paas har vakt eke47 rifl rakhata tha
 According to police records, the campaign launched by the police for the elimination of Sriprakash
 us par lagbhag ek karod rupee kharch hue the
 This was the first such case in itself, when the police spent such a huge amount of money to apprehend a criminal
 us vakt servilans kaa istemaal kiya janaa bhi kaaphi mahangaa tha
 It can be called the most expensive police mission ever
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye 2014 behad khaas rahaa
 This year under his leadership, BJP came to power at the Center with an absolute majority
 dilli main desh kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baad modi ke dam par bijepi ne haryana or maharashtra jaise rajyon main bhi jeet darj kii
 After becoming Prime Minister, Modi traveled to America, Australia, Japan, Myanmar, Bhutan
 is dauraan unki lokapriyata ke charche deshi or videshi media main khub hue
 In 2014, Narendra Modi emerged as the global leader
 isi kaa parinaam rahaa ki vah 'time person of year' kii res main aae or readers pole main top par rahe, lekin vah 'time person of da year' nahin ban sake
 The same thing disappointed his fans in 2014
 nahin is saal modi ne har jagah apane naam kaa danka hi bajvaya
 Questions began to arise that if the readers' poll was not to be accepted, then why did Time conduct the survey? Why did 'ebola Fighters' become Time Person of the Year when Modi won the Readers Poll? All these questions are legitimate, but Time magazine also has its own history
 aaiye jaanate hai un factors ko jinaki vajah se modi nahin ban paae 'time person of da year'
 
 
 What happened in the readers poll? Narendra Modi got 16 percent votes in the Readers Poll
 time ke pole main kul 50 lakh vot pade the
 Modi defeated Ferguson Protesters, Hong Kong's pro-democracy Joshua Wong, Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and Ebola Fighters to get the most votes in the poll, but was not included in the final short list
 time kii short list main jaik maa, tim cook, vladimir putin, ibola fiters aadi shaamil the
 Why 'ebola Fighters', why not Modi? Time magazine managing editor Nancy Gibbs said, 'ebola is a war and a warning
 ibola kii rokthaam main global health system fail rahaa
 In such a situation, some women and men came forward and assured to fight against this disease
 unka tyaag or samarpan bhav bahut badi baat rahi, isliye ibola fiters time person of da year bane'
 He was elected 'person of the Year' after 2007
 After 2007, Time was chosen as Person of the Year to celebrities like Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama, Mark Zuckerberg, Pope Francis
 time kii hakeekat kya he?time ke anusaar agar koi vyakti vishesh, group, idia or object prabhaav chodta he, to use person of da year chunaa ja saktaa he

 Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati has surprised everyone by announcing a review of alliance with Samajwadi Party
 haalanki mayawati kii raajnneeti ko jaanane waalon ko 24 saal pehle kii ek ghatana yaad hogi? jo unki raajnneeti se parichit nahin hai unhen ham lagbhag dhai dashak pehle kii ek ahm raajnneeti halchal yaad dilaanaa chahenge
 Just 24 years before today, that date was 3 June 1995, when Mayawati became the CM of Uttar Pradesh with the support of the BJP, putting aside Akhilesh's father Mulayam Singh Yadav
 is baar vah siem to nahin banane ja raheen lekin ek tarah se mayawati ne samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya akhilesh yadav ko siyaasi dhokhaa diya he
 Because if someone has benefited the most in the 2019 elections, then only the BSP is being named after the BJP
 2014 main basapa kaa ek bhi saansad nahin jeet paaya tha lekin sapa se haath milaane ke baad basapa ke 10 saansad jeetne main safal rahe
 Experts also say that if the BSP had not got the sp's votes, it would have been impossible to win so many mps
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki akhilesh kisi bahaane se gathbandhan se alag ho jaaenge lekin uske pehle mayawati ne apane vichaar jaahir kar die
 On May 3, 1995, Mayawati became the Chief Minister of UP, just a day before the famous guesthouse incident of UP took place
 1993 main ram lahar par savaar ko bijepi ko upi kii satta se baahar karne karne ke liye samaajawaadee party pramukh mulaayam singh yadav or bispi pramukh kanshiram ne gathjod kiya tha
 SP-BSP fought together in the assembly elections
 espi ko 109 siten mili or bispi ko 67 siten ain
 Mulayam Singh Yadav became the CM of undivided UP in collaboration with BSP
 lekin espi-bispi kii ye dosti zyada din tak nahin chali
 The BSP withdrew support to the government on 2 June 1995 due to mutual estrangement and Mulayam Singh's government came to a minority
 bahumat jugad karne ke liye sapa ne basapa ke kai vidhayakon se sampark saadhaa, lekin baat nahin bani
 On June 2, 1995, Mayawati was meeting with her MLA in room number one of the state guest house in Lucknow
 tabhi kathith taur par samaajawaadee party ke ugr kaaryakartaaon ne unpar hamalaa kar diya
 This incident had a profound impact on Mayawati's political journey, she could never forgive the then SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 24 saal tak donon raajnneetik dalon main koi sampark nahin rahaa
 The very next day of this incident, Mayawati became CM with external support from BJP and other parties
 bataur siem ye unki pehali pari thi
 However, his tenure as CM was only four months
 17 oktober 1995 main ye sarkaar gir gai
 Akhilesh showed political foresight to strike a political friendship with Mayawati
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan upi kii raajnneeti main mahagathbandhan naam kaa abhinav prayog hua
 Mayawati and Akhilesh, the two warriors of politics, came together to stop the BJP, forgetting the years-old rivalry
 piem narendra modi ke ubhaar ko rokna donon ke liye chunauti thi iske liye donon ne is gathbandhan kii jarurat ko samajha
 This alliance was seen as an alternative politics against the BJP in the country and Uttar Pradesh
 lekin chunaav nateezon main manachaaha nateeja na milane ke baad is gathbandhan par sankat ke badal mandara rahe the
 Mayawati has put the last nail in the coffin of the Grand Alliance, saying that Akhilesh could not even win his wife in the Lok Sabha elections

 Telangana BJP president g Kishan Reddy, while trying to defend his party mla's controversial statement on Sania Mirza, said on Friday that he was not against making him the brand ambassador of the state but was making the plea for those students Who are not getting the stipend since their parents have settled there after 1956
 unhone kaha ki telugana sarkaar ne tennis star sania mirza ko brands doot banaaya jisane ek pakistani se shaadi kii he jabaki das yaa 15 saal pehle hyderabad main aakar based chaatro ko fees vaapasi karne ko taiyaar nahin
 He said, 'you are giving messenger status to Sania Mirza, so why not help the students
 aap un chaatro ko wajife or fees vaapasi se inkaar kar rahe hai jo 10 yaa 15 saal pehle hyderabad main aakar based hai
 But Sania Mirza is married to a Pakistani and you are making her a brand ambassador
 ham brands doot banane ke khilaaf nahin hai lekin donon masalon kii tulana kar rahe hai
 Reddy said that BJP leader k Laxman in the Telangana Assembly had also given a statement on the same lines but the media twisted it
 popular tivi sho tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma main dayaban yani disha vakaani ko lekar kaaphi samay se suspence kaa bana hua he
 Disha Wakani has not been seen in the show for a long time
 unke waapas aane yaa na aane ko lekar pichley kuch maheenon se kai tarah ke kayaas ja chuke hai
 It is also said that a search is on for a new face instead of direction
 ab disha ko lekar ek or khabar saamne aa rahi he
 It is being claimed that the direction of the direction is now very low in the show
 charchaaon kii maane to disha vakaani sho main dayaban kaa kirdaar nahin nibhaaengi
 According to the report of Telechakkar, the direction and the makers of the show have not reached any agreement regarding the return of the actress to the show
 production house ne ab kisi nae actress ko sho main laane ke liye prastaav rakhaa he
 In such a situation, it is believed that the audience of Taarak Mehta's Ulta Chashma will soon be able to see another face in Dayaben's character instead of direction

 Along with this, she has also been in the discussion due to the uniqueness of that character
 sitambar, 2017 main disha matternity live par gai thi
 He has been missing from the show since then
 november main unhone ek baby girl ko janm diya tha
 After this, Disha got her holiday date extended
 tab se aaj tak vah sho par waapas nahin lauti hai
 There was also a report in the middle that the reason for the altercation between Disha Vakani and the producers is Mayur Pandya, the husband of the actress
 bataaya gaya ki mayur ne production house se maang kii thi ki disha maheene main sirf 15 din hi kaam karengi or in dinon main vah sirf 4 ghante shoot karengi
 It was also said that he had also demanded a 100 per cent increase in fees, which the makers did not like
 aap kii jeet ke saath hi sabase charchit jumala jo chal niklaa he, wo he '5 saal kejariwal'
 That is, they are the face of this magnificent victory

 Kejriwal is now back to national politics, not just Delhi
 1
 Kejriwal has shown in Delhi what Narendra Modi and Amit Shah did together in UP during the Lok Sabha elections
 vahaan basapa, sapa kaa safaya ho gaya
 Here both BJP and Congress
 aise main kejariwal kaa kad modi or shah ke baraabar ho gaya he
 If they wish, they can once again emerge in the politics of the country
 2
 In such a situation, when it was believed that Modi wave is going on in the country, Sehri is the head of Kejriwal to win about 90 percent of the seats in Delhi
 deshbhar kaa modi or bijepi virdohi vipaksh aise hi chehre kii talash main tha
 If they want, they can become this face
 3
 Prior to the elections, Lalu, Mulayam etc
 leaders have been giving statements in favor of AAP
 ab jabaki kejariwal ne apana dam dikhaa diya he to ye sabhi tisare morche kaa netritv unhen dene ke liye bhi man bana sakate hai
 If Kejriwal wishes, he can accept this leadership
 4
 Kejriwal has won such a big victory because of some of his basic promises
 isamen bhrashtachar kaa safaya pramukh he
 When they have got this unprecedented majority they can also implement it
 5
 The ideal administration that Kejriwal has been talking about through the Lokpal can be implemented in Delhi
 ise model rajya bana sakate hai

 '' sarkaar dwaara haal hi main i-kamrs kii pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) niti main jari kiye gaye spashtikaran ko lagu kiye jane kii taarikh 1 farvari 2019 se aage badaye jane kii kuch i-commers companiyon kii maang ko kanfederation of ol india trederj(cat) ne betuka bataate hue virodh kiya he
 In a letter sent to Mr
 Ramesh Abhishek, Secretary, DIPP Department of the Ministry of Commerce, on Sunday, Kat has registered his strong opposition to this
 saath hi yah bhi maang kii he ki is niti ke antargat i-commers companiyaan privet label yaa apane brands se saamaan bech sakati hai yaa nahin, isko spasht kiya jaae
 cat's national general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said in a letter to Secretary Abhishek that the government should not bend under any pressure and in any case should not extend the date
 unhone kaha ki saal 2018 kaa press note-2 keval 2016 kiefadipolicy ke press note-3 kaa spashtikaran bhar hi he or policy 2016 se hi jari he
 No change has been made in the policy, rather the policy has been clarified
 is nazariye se diipipi dwaara 1 farvari 2019 ko ankit karnaa sarkaar kii saraasar galati he or isliye bhi kisi bhi taarikh ko badalanaa sarkaar kii ek or galati hogi
 Khandelwal said that the demand by kee-commerce companies to extend the date is a well thought out move and they want to stop the implementation of the policy under the guise of it
 jisase laagat se bhi kam daam par maal bechney or bade discount dene kaa unka kaarobaar chalata rahe or ve desh ke ritel bazaar par apana kabja jamaa saken
 He said that the government should not come under any pretense of these companies and in any case the date should not be extended further
 khandelwal ne patr main yah bhi kaha ki praivat label yaa apane brands se maal bechney ke jariye se i-commers companiyaan market par ekadhikaar kaa bada khel khelti hai
 In a circular issued by the government on January 3, many doubts have been resolved, but one solution has led to confusion over the continuation of the private label or brand
 unhone is policy ke antargat praivet label yaa brands dwaara maal bechnaa jari rahegaa yaa nahin, ise spasht kiye jane kii maang kii he
 If this continues, then the policy will have no meaning and the government's intention to establish healthy competition and equal business environment in e-commerce will be completely lost

 All these parties expressed their complete confidence in the Election Commission and agreed to hold the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 bataa den ki april-may main desh main loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 In such a situation, assembly elections will be held in many states along with the Lok Sabha elections
 is kadi main jammu-kashmir main bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi vidhansabha chunaav karaae jane kii sambhaavna he
 The team led by Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora met different political parties, top security and administrative officials to take stock of the preparations for the Lok Sabha elections
 team main teen sadsy hai jinhone jammu-kashmir kii 10 partiyon ke netaa ke saath mulaakaat kii
 Actually, the Supreme Court directs that after the dissolution of the assembly, the new election should be held within six months
 jammu- kashmir ke maamle main yah samay seemaa may, 2019 main khatm ho rahi he
 This is the reason why the Election Commission is exploring the possibility of conducting assembly elections in the state along with the Lok Sabha

 aabaadi ke taur par dekhen to upi bharat kaa sabase adhik aabaadi vaala rajya he
 This is the reason that the number of IPS officers is also higher than other states of India
 1 janvari 2016 tak upi main kul 404 ipies adhikariyon kii tainaati thi jo tay seemaa se 21 pratishat kam he
 Let us tell you that the ideal number of deployment of IPS officers in Uttar Pradesh is 517
 lekin phir bhi rajya main transfar kii dar rashtriya ausat se chaar guna adhik he
 In Uttar Pradesh, wearing an IPS uniform may be a matter of concern, but not comfort
 is baat kii tasdik beuro of police research and deveopment (beepiardi) ke nae aankade karte hai
 According to the data, there has been a 37 percent decrease in transfers of police officers, but still between 2006 and 2015, IPS officers in UP held their posts for less than a year on average
 police adhikari apana shahar samajhate usase pehle unka transfar ho gaya uske baad bhale krime rate doguni ho jaae
 According to the data, between 2007 and 2015 (2006 data is not available), IPS officers were transferred 2,251 times in UP, which was 43 percent of the IPS transfers in India
 aapako bataa den ki isi bich puure bharat main kul 5169 baar ipies adhikariyon kaa transfar hua
 Let us also tell you that the number of IPS officers in UP is 11% of India's IPS cadre
 duusare number par tamilnaduapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki ipies adhikariyon ke transfar ke maamle main upi jaisaa koi or rajya nahin he
 Tamil Nadu may be second in the list, but there have been only 453 transfers, which is only about one-fifth (1 / 5) of the transfers in UP
 akhilesh ne kiye tabadatod transfarapako bataa den ki janvari 2016 main samaajawaadee party ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne 80 varisht ipies adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kiya tha jisamen ek police mahanireekshak bhi shaamil the
 The following month, the Chief Minister released another massive transfer list in which 50 IPS officers posted in 12 districts were moved
 khaas baat yah rahi ki is list main kuch ve naam bhi shaamil the jinke janvari main transfar hue the
 The long transferred list of IPS officers in UP is nothing new
 akhilesh sarkaar ne satta main kadam rakhte hi march 2012 main lagbhag 100 ipies adhikariyon kaa transfar kiya tha
 All parties do the transfer
 It is not the case that Akhilesh Sarkar has done this transfer on IPS officers
 pichhali sarkarein bhi aisa hi karti ai hai
 According to BPRD data, Mayawati made an average of about 261 transfers every year during her entire reign (2007 to 2011)
 agar mayawati kii satta main hue tabadalon se akhilesh sarkaar ke tabadalon kii tulana karen to akhilesh ne apane chaar saalon main ausatan prativarsh 163 tabadale kiye hai (yahaan 2016 ke aankade uplabdh nahin hai)

 Indira Gandhi went to the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Court's decision where the country's largest court on June 24 allowed her to continue as the Prime Minister, but did not reject the High Court order
 isi faisle ke ek din baad indira ne desh main apatkaal laga diya
 Before the Emergency was declared in the country on June 25, 1975, several events prepared its outline
 isaki shuruyaat 12 june 1975 se ho gai, jab elahabaad hoicourt ke jaj justise jagmohan laal sinha ne is din apane bade or saahasik faisle main raibareli se saansad ke rup main indira gandhi ke chunaav ko avaidh qaraar de diya
 Also, the High Court prohibited him from contesting any kind of elections for the next 6 years
 11 din baad supreme court pahunchin indiracourt ke is faisle ke baad indira gandhi ke paas rajyasabha main jane kaa rasta bhi nahin bachaa tha
 For this reason Indira Gandhi had no other way but to leave the post of Prime Minister
 faisle ke 11 din baad 23 june ko indira ne supreme court main isaki chunauti dete hue yachika daakhil kii ki elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle par puri tarah se roak lagaai jaae
 Indira Gandhi was disqualified for the 1971 election (photo-getty) The next day, on 24 June, Justice VR Krishna Iyer of the Supreme Court's summer vacation bench ruled that they would not completely abstain from the High Court verdict Will apply
 lekin unhone indira ko pradhanmantri pad par bane rahane kii ijaajat de di
 It also directed that she would not be able to cast any vote till the final decision is taken
 desh main is samay indira gandhi ke lihaaj se raajnneetik halaat bahut achche nahin chal rahe the
 There were voices of protest against him inside and outside the party
 1971 ke chunaav main jeet hasil karne ke liye indira ko khaasi mehnat kerani padi
 In this election she gave the popular slogan of 'garibi Hatao' and on the basis of this slogan, she returned to power again with an absolute majority
 congress ko is chunaav main 518 siton main 352 siten hasil huin or indira phir se pradhanmantri ban gayi
 4 years after the election, Kesindira contested from Rae Bareli parliamentary seat and managed to win the election by over one lakh votes, but her rival and United Socialist Party candidate Rajnarayan did not accept the decision and Indira's victory Challenged in Allahabad High Court
 yah cese us samay behad charchit rahaa, 'indira gandhi banaam rajanarayan' ke naam se janaa gaya, lekin is chunaav par faisla 4 saal baad 1975 main aayaa
 Rajnarayan in his case accused Indira Gandhi of corruption, misuse of government machinery and resources
 rajanarayan kii ore shantibhushan ne jabaki indira kii ore se nanabhay palkhivala ne cese ladaa
 Shantibhushan, appearing for Rajnarayan, said that Indira even used government employees and resources in campaigning
 unhone iske liye pradhanmantri ke sachiv yashpal kapur kaa udhaaharan diya jinhone raashtrapati kii ore se istipha manjuur hone se pehle hi indira ke liye kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 And the same argument went against Indira and the court rejected her election on the basis of the Representation of People Act
 lagaataar bad rahe the hamaleis bich gujarat or bihar main chaatr andolanon ke kaaran vipaksh ekajute hota ja rahaa tha
 The Opposition had united under the leadership of 'lok Nayak' Jayaprakash Narayan (JP) and was a constant attacker on the central government
 hoicourt or phir supreme court ke faisle ke baad vipaksh or hamalavar ho gaya
 On the evening of June 25, the next day after the decision of the country's largest court, Jayaprakash Narayan (JP) had a rally at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan
 jepi ne is raily main badi sankhya main aae logon ke bich indira gandhi se istife kii maang kii
 After the court's decision, Indira was being surrounded all-round and it is said that she did not want to leave the post of Prime Minister under any circumstances

 Lalu Prasad Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has now started exploring the possibility of a new grand alliance in Bihar, seeing no possibility of JDU seceding from the NDA
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye party rajya main bahujan samaaj party or sipiai-emel ko jodne par vichaar kar rahi he taaki dalit or gaiyr yadav obisi vot party kii taraf aakarshith kiye ja saken
 Significantly, Lalu tried to bring non-nda parties on one platform by organizing a 'BJP Bhagao, Desh Bachao' rally held in Patna in August 2017
 lekin tab bispi supremeo mayawati ne is aamantran ko thukaraate hue kaha tha ki jab tak 2019 ke liye seat saajhedaari or gathbandhan kaa praaroop tay nahin ho jaataa, unki party kisi ke saath manch saajha nahin karegi
 Recently, Mayawati had emphasized that the BSP will form an alliance with any party only if it is given a 'respectable number' of seats, otherwise it will fight alone
 basapa ke saath gathjod ke dwaara upi ke upachunaavon main bijepi ko haraane ke badaspa netaa akhilesh yadavane kaha tha ki vah aam chunaav main gathbandhan ko banaae rakhane ke liye kisi bhi balidaan ko taiyaar hai
 However, there is no confirmation of any alliance in Bihar, due to which the local leaders and activists of BSP have started preparing for the Lok Sabha elections at the ground level
 karnataka main mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami keshapathgrahan samarohame tamaam vipakshi netao ke saath mayawati ke bhi rahane se utsahit argedy ke ek netaa ummid jataate hai ki bihar main basapa ke saath seat saajhedaari kaa samjhauta ho jayega
 According to him, if this alliance is formed, it will have a good effect on at least 6 seats in the up-bihar border and votes will increase in other places as well
 gauratlab he ki bihar main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bispi ko 7
 65 lakh votes were received, which increased to 7 in the 2015 assembly elections
 88 lakh tak pahunch gaye
 However, it could not get any seat in Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha
 iske alaava argedy makapa (CPI-ML) ko bhi gathbandhan se jodne par vichaar kar rahi he
 This party has some influence in the backward and Dalit communities of the state
 party ko jithan ram maanjhi ke hindustani avam morcha kaa pehle hi samarthan mil chukaa he jo daliton main kuch janaadhar rakhti he

, Gandhi Jayanti day, 30 January means the feeling of death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi
 ahimsa par rajya pryojit hamalaa godse kii bandook se zyada khatarnaak he
 Mahatma Gandhi's greatest achievement was that he put the ancient Indian thought of non-violence at the center of the social, political concept of modern India
 hamaari rashtriya chetana main basii ye ahimsa hi thi jisane aazaadee ke lambey or kathin safar main hamen digne nahin diya
 There is something far beyond the antics of physical violence
 yah gulaami ke vaastavik sparup ko pahchaanane kii hamaare purvajon kii adbhut samaj se upji he
 Everyone becomes a prisoner in a slavery environment
 shoshit varg bhay, abhaav, asahaayta kaa, to shoshak varg satta kii laalasaa or apni kathith aavashyaktaa kaa
 Responding to anger, revenge and violence arising out of exploitation leads to deteriorating social environment
 ahimsa hamen har haal main daman se ladane kaa hausala detii he
 The path of non-violence neither suppresses nor endures oppression
 ahimsa hameshaa hamen maanavtaa ke prati sajag karti he
 Fear breaks the cycle of longing, hatred and discrimination
 ahimsa ’swa’ par ’raaj’ yani purna niyantran kaa rasta he
 This is a situation in which the exploiters get rid of the exploiters and the exploiters from the habit of exploitation
 shoshit or shoshak, donon ko hi daman kaa chakravyuuh todna sikhaati he
 Everyone should get freedom to search for the truth, that's why the nuanced eye of Indian spirituality has adopted non-violence right from the beginning
 ahimsa raajnneeti ko samvedansheel banaati he
 Ahimsa reconstructs the structure of society
 taaki sabase kamjor ke haath main satta or uske sahbhaag ke aadhaar par samaaj apni uplabdhi kaa akalan kar sake
 It is non-violence that makes room for the powerless, marginalized people and minorities at the center of political will
 ahimsa ek aisi raajnneetik shuchita ko sthapit karti he jahaan sabase kamjor ke sangrakshan or samavesh ko nihit kiya gaya ho
 So that under no circumstances should this fundamental value be fractured
 ahimsa satta main karunaa, samvednaa laati he
 So that power does not remain as a weapon of exploitation of each other
 satta hamaare saanjhe bhavishya ko sanvaarane kaa madhyam ban sake
 We inherited leadership devoted to non-violence from the freedom movement
 hamaare sanvaidhanik mulyon kaa chunaav ahimsa kii takat kaa shaktishaalee aagaaz he
 The constitution of our country was created in a time of extreme poverty and inequality
 ek taraf garib, besahaara, ashikshit aabaadi thi
 Emerging from oppression, clad in institutional social distinctions, deprived of political participation, the poor were, on the other hand, a relatively small powerful class with capital, land, education and domination
 vibhaajan ke bhayankar sampradayik dange or lakhon logon kii maut kii traasadee se bharat abhi ubhar bhi nahin paaya tha
 Generally, the power would argue that only a small section of sovereignty should take advantage of the opportunity and strengthen their monopoly over the nation
 satta main baithe log kah sakate the ki hamaari ek maatr praathamikta puunji nirmaan honi chahie
 We will not be able to tolerate the inefficiency created by public participation
 ve apni pairvi main yah bhi kah sakate the ki vaishvik pratispardhaa main tikne or pratibha sampann hone kii raah main garib, besahaara, ashikshit aabaadi ke hawaale rashtriya disha nirdesan kar dena badi baadha he
 We will find it very heavy
 vibhaajan kii vibhatsata ko ve dar or bhedbhaav failaane ke liye istemaal kar sakate the
 According to his convenience, it could be blamed on certain communities, declaring them as synonymous with danger, disqualifying them from disqualification for equality
 baapu ko sabase pehle netaji ne kaha tha 'rashtrapita'ye log pracheen granthon ke hawaale se mahilaon or sarvhaara varg ko haashiye par dhakelne kii prakriya ko nyaaysangat tehra sakate the
 But what happened was just the opposite
 apane prabhaav kaa istemaal satta hathiyaane yaa aise satahi tark prastut karne ke bajaay netritvkartaaon ne bharat ko samta kii raah pradaan kii thi
 a path that transferred its wildly economic, political, social power from a small elite to a myriad of unmatched people
 parinamtah hamen ek aisa samvidhan mila jo ki maanav itihaas main shashaktikaran or shantipurna saamaajik kranti kaa mahatvakankshi praytn karne ko drushtigat, vaidhanik aadhaar detaa he
 Every provision of the constitution, whether one person one vote one value, suffrage for all adults, equality of opportunity and influence, positive protection for marginalized people, secularization of nation state with a single religion recognizes the exclusive rights of tribal people Or the scientist confirms the advocacy of modern ideas
 iskaa asar krantikari tha or sabhi paramparaagat bhedamulak dhaanchon par sidhaa prahaar bhi tha
 There must have been many reasons behind these enlightened elections of our ancestors
 magar sabase ahm baat yah thi ki samvidhan kii rachana ahimsa se paripurna rashtriya raajnneetik chetana ke maahaul main hui
 Generally, despite the unprecedented challenges and temptations such as dodging an old man, the leaders representing the country and its representatives had the discretion, nobility and humility to give wings to the imagination of 33 crore independent Indians
 usko saakaar karne kaa avasar de saken
 This could only be ensured by the original spirit of non-violence
 aisa karke unhone desh ko na keval mukti ke path par agrasar kiya, balki fasiwad, aupniveshik daastaa or vishwa yudhon ke parinaam main se karahate vishwa ko bhi karunaa kaa rasta dikhaaya
 This generation undoubtedly stood up to their forefathers
 yah pradarshit kiya ki shikhar kaa netritv ugrata aadambar yaa fabtiyon se nahin nikharata
 Power is handled with compassion, humility and nobility
 badi dukhad baat he ki satta se hamaare vartmaan sambandh iske thik vipareet hai
 The electoral majority has strongly supported the removal of Muslims from all democratic places
 zyaadaatar udyogpati kisaan kii bhoomi ko paane hetu unki aawaaj ko kuchalane main koi asuvidha nahin mahasoos karte
 Some courts consider interference with the conversion of an adult woman to be her right and obligation
 rajya sarkarein adivaasiyon ko bhoomi se bedakhal karti hai
 Far from giving them any compensation, their own ancestors do not even give them a chance to be heard before grabbing the ground
 sabhi saamaajik netaa bhojan arthath rashan ko band karaane kii dhamkee dekar shauchalay nirmaan ke abhiyaan ko suvidha se apni sahmati dete hai
 Learn- Why is the picture of Mahatma Gandhi printed on the note? The army considers Indian citizens to make human armor as their efforts
 suchi anwarat ho sakati he
 These people are not representative of everyone
 magar nihsandeh ahimsa ke liye yah amanglik kaal he
 How did we get such a downgrade? Non-violence has always challenged centralized power
 vigat sarkarein bhi kai baar ahimsa ke maarg se hati hai
 But this current system is trying to remove non-violence from our common consciousness
 aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 In this project, moral correctness or so-called sanctity is his dominant weapon
 is kritrim naitik gaurav abhiyaan kii vajah aisi banaai jaati he, jisase kisi kaa bhi bhed nahin ho saktaa, koi nakaar nahin saktaa
 'shouldn't society be free from open defecation?' Should terrorism not end? Shouldn't the corrupt be punished? Shouldn't our sisters and daughters get protection? ' These queries are used to target a class
 us lakshith varg ko kamatar or karunaa ke ayogy bataaya jaakar use uski aukaat main rakhane kii baat kii jaati he
 So that the perceived progress of the society is not interrupted
 kaala dhan ikattha karne vaale, khule main shouch karne vaale, kar chori karte vyavsaayee, gomance bhakshak evam vitarak, ahindi bhashi, vande maataram ko nahin gane vaale, kashmiri patharbaj, aaazaad khyaal chaatr, satyanveshi patrkaar evam mahilaayein jo tathakthith bhartiya samskruti kaa paalan nahin karti hai, aadi lambii suchi he
 a list that can be considered worthy of airing all kinds of prejudices, fears and appearances
 inamen se prayek varg ko lakshya bataakar hinsak, lubhaavne naitik abhiyaan ko chalaaya jaataa he
 The target class is said to be synonymous with immorality and outside the purview of reform
 taaki apane gunahon ke atmavlokan kaa boj suvidha se jhatak diya jaae, kisi par bhi apana nyaay thopane se pehle uski jagah swayan ko rakhkar dekhne kii musiibat se bachaa ja sake
 This moral war is presented as the last indispensable sole weapon to overthrow the problem
 itane mahatv kaa abhiyaan kii ’ant bhala to sab bhala’
 That is, no matter what route is used to achieve the desired moral destination
 atah naitik yuddh se judaav, vyakti ko deshbhakt ke taur par pramanit karata he
 The person has nothing to do in it
 keval ghrinaa ko angikaar karnaa he, hikaarat ko apnaanaa he, mook tamashbin banakar utsahit hokar tathakthith doshi varg par maansik kaalikh malana he
 It means that in this moral war, even if it is only right for a moment, we have to uproot non-violence from the mind
 gandhi ji jis ahimsa ko jiya karte the or jiske liye khud kaa tyaag kar gaye, vah ahimsa aise ek laghu abhiyaan ke jariye hamaare avchetan maanas se har baar shaniah shanai tirohit hoti ja rahi he
 Gandhiji used the ancient traditional wisdom path of the country to build a nation state like India
 ek aisa maarg jo ki maanav maatr ko apane apane satya shodhan kii sampurna aazaadee pradaan kare
 This route is being attacked today
 ve hamen hamaare apane dambh ke pinjre main asuraksha, kripanata kii hathkadiyon se las bhaybheet boune banaakar rakhana chaahate hai
 The country wants to keep the reins of its own
 is gandhi jayanti par baapu ke prati hamaari sachhee shradhanjali yahi ho sakati he ki ham apane bheetar kii ’aatma’ ko malin na hone den
 Lead him to greatness
 aisa tab sambhav he jab ham apane ahan ko bhulaakar maanav maatr ko gale lagane lagenge
 Let us also embrace those who are still descendants of Godse's thoughts
 unako bhi prem, karunaa or vinamrata se angikaar karen
 Nathuram's bullets did not hit Gandhi's values
 uski goliyaan jo na kar sakin, wo ghrinaa kaa aaj kaa vaataavaran na kar paae
 It will be sure to go somewhere

 Rahul Bowling is also captaining with batting
 rahul gandhi pichley 9 saalon main saansad or mahasachiv ke rup main jis tarah se agrim sanghathanon kaa swaroop badla he wo apane aap main kranti he
 Now he has taken over the responsibility of Congress
 6 maheenon main unka kaam khud bolegaa
 This information and broadcasting minister Manish Tiwari said in the direct talk program till date
 rahul gandhi se mat pucho phijul sawaal!manish tiwari ne ye bhi kaha kiraahul gandhi upaadhyaksh ke pad par aakar naujavaanon main rakt sanchaar kiya he
 If the UPA comes to power in 2014, who will be the Prime Minister
 is sawaal ke jawaab main manish tiwari ne kaha, 'chunaav ek saal dur hai, is saal hamaari praathamikta arthvyavastha ko sudrudh bananaa he
 To fulfill the promises which have not been fulfilled
 khaskar khadyann suraksha, mahila shashaktikaran or mahila bill kaa vaada puraa karnaa he
 Then when the 2014 elections come, the Congress party will fight and the UPA alliance will win and the Prime Minister will come out
 2004 main jab ham chunaav lade the us vakt desh main atal bihari vaajapeyi piem the
 The Congress party won the elections and the UPA was structured
 rahul ke bol: narendra modi karte hai nafrat kii raajnneeti!satta ke do centre ko lekar digvijay singh kii bayaanbaji ke sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha ki digvijay singh varisht netaa he or unki alag muddon par apni raay he
 As far as the Congress and the government are concerned, we have strengthened the economy, political perspective of this country with coordination and balance for the last 9 years
 rahul gandhi congress team ke captain hai, lekin ye captain naa to bowling karnaa chahta he naa hi batting
 Absolutely not captaincy
 ye congress ke liye dikkat kii baat nahin he, is sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki rahul bowling, batting ke saath captaini bhi kar rahe hai
 The manner of functioning of each person is different
 kai log baatcheet karke kaam karte he to kuch kaa kaam khud bolta he
 The way Rahul Gandhi has changed the nature of forward organizations as MP, General Secretary for the last 9 years is a revolution in itself
 ab unhone congress kii jimmedaari sanbhali he
 You will see his work speak for itself in the next 6 months
 aap kahenge ki ve akraamakata se batting or dhuandhar bowling kar rahe hai
 BJP is bringing forward Narendra Modi's face for the 2014 elections, but on why the Congress is not putting forward Rahul Gandhi's name, Manish Tiwari said, "as far as i know, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari is the difference in all these
 congress party apni ranneeti or raajnneetik soch is baat par tay nahin karti ki vipaksh kii taraf se koun chunaav lard rahaa he
 If BJP wants to forward someone, then it is their internal matter
 ham 2014 main logon ke paas apane kiye hue kaam ko lekar jaaenge
 On the Central Government's question of misuse of CBI, Manish Tiwari said, "as far as misuse of CBI is concerned
 main tahalaka kaa vakil tha, venketaswami or phukan kamishan kaa
 On the day you have time, i will tell you how the CBI and ED were misused by the BJP
 mulaayam singh varisht netaa he jo wo kehete he, main usamen nahin janaa chahta
 Anyway, the charge sheet of every investigation is filed in the court
 adaalat uske upar faisla detii he
 There has been no such decision in the last 9 years in which it has been said that the government has tried to find someone wrong
 ye mithyaa he, bebuniyaad baat he
 Asked why the Prime Minister was not being called before the Joint Parliament Committee, Manish Tiwari said, "I have been a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its proceedings are going on
" us par tippanee karnaa uchit nahin he
 Putting aside some parliamentary beliefs, i want to tell you that this matter arose but this thing was rejected because all the papers and documents Yashwant Sinha are talking about, all that the BJP is talking about Documents exist
 e raja jepisi ke saamne aana chaahate he, lekin ve bulaae nahin ja rahe hai, is sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha, 'jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, oktober main jab tak main jepisi main tha hamaare saamne kabhi koi aisi baat nahi aayi ki raja jepisi ke saamne aana chaahate hai
 The second thing is that the people you are accusing are trying to bring those people under a political conspiracy

 Following the bjp's defeat in the latest by-election, the Shiv Sena has given the ruling BJP at the Center a pretext to 'make the people not understand their inheritance' and 'not to take swordsmanship in the air'
 shivasena pramukh ne bijepi ko pair jameen par rakhane kii hidaayat di thi
 Replying to this, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the party's feet are on the ground
 yaad rahe ki bijepi or shivasena puraane sahyogi hai lekin maharashtra aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye seat bantwaare ke mudde par dono partiyon main khinchataan chal rahi he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has instructed BJP in a very strong tone in the party mouthpiece 'saamana'
 unhone ise maharashtra ke chunaavon ke liye bhi ek sabak bataate hue likhaa, 'yah sabak sabake liye he
 The public should not consider their inheritance
 pair jameen par rakhen
 Do not let the frenzy of victory climb and do not do fencing by riding on the wind
 ''nahin hua lav jihad ke mudde kaa phayda'unhone likhaa, 'yah sabak jo log lenge vahi maharashtra par kabja karenge
 Otherwise the public will reverse and peel the skin
 ' shivasena pramukh ne likhaa ki 'lav jihad' kaa mudda uthaane kaa bhi bijepi ko koi phayda nahin hua
 He wrote, 'the issue of love jihad was raised in Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin uskaa kuch vishesh parinaam hua tha, aisa nahin dikhaai detaa
 However, the Shiv Sena chief also said that the by-election results should not be linked to Modi
 unhone likhaa, 'mahatvapurn baat yah he ki (congress ko) yah jeet rahul gandhi yaa sonia gandhi ke kaaran mili, aisa koi nahin bol saktaa
 In the same way, this is a referendum given against Modi, so no one should be killed
 'maharashtra main akele ladane ko taiyaar shivasena!yaad rahe ki maharashtra main siton ko lekar bijepi or shivesna aamane-saamne hai
 The BJP had given the formula for 135-135 seats, while the Shiv Sena is determined to field candidates in 150 seats
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke prastaav ko khaarij karte hue somvaar ko saaf kar diya tha ki bijepi ko 135 siten dena sambhav nahin he
 According to sources, it is reported that Shiv Sena has prepared a list of its candidates for all 288 seats in the assembly
 ek khabar yah bhi he ki upachunaav ke nattejey ke baad nae formule ke tahat shivasena ko 145 siten dene par vichaar ho rahaa he jabaki bijepi ko 125 siten mil sakati he
 Experts believe that the bjp's poor performance in the by-election will strengthen Shiv Sena's claim for seat sharing

 'pakistani channels ran news related to Sarabjit's release for a long time on Tuesday, but later in the middle of the night, suddenly the President's spokesman Farhatullah Babar said that the President had nothing to do with any such decision
 unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki kuch bhram he
 The first thing is that it is not a matter of granting amnesty
 sabase ahm baat yah ki yah vyakti sarbajit singh nahin, balki surajeet singh baldiyat sucha singh he

 Judge Ranganath Pandey of Allahabad High Court wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just before his retirement, in which he said that the appointment of judges in the judiciary goes on discussing tea in closed rooms
 yahaan koi paardarshita nahin he
 In the appointment, nepotism and casteism dominate
 jiskaa matlab he ki jajon ke bachche yaa rishtedaar hi jaj banate hai
 For people outside the circle of families, the possibilities are slim
 hindi main likhe apane patr main unhone likhaa ki rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog (NJAC) se nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main paardarshita kii aashaa jaagi thi
 But the judges unfortunately declared it unconstitutional as it hindered the appointment of their family members
 yah pehali baar nahin he jo kisi jaj ne is tarah ke aarope lagaae hai
 If we work a little hard, the list of those who say so is very long
 ranganath pandeya kii is chitthee ke baad unke ritairement par elahabaad hoicourt main hi die jane vaale 'phul court reference' (ek tarah kii ferewel party) ko bina kisi kaaran se radd kar diya gaya
 He has now retired as a judge, but the issue he reminded will never retire
 un jaison kii awaz is bahes ko phir se shuru kar degi
 When we resist something, we make it a circle, making it the center
 is ghere kii trigya (radius) tanya (stracable) hoti he
 Pull as much as you like and keep enlarging the circle
 aise main aap is ghere main har us masale ko daal sakate hai, jo uske centre se sambhddha he
 Taking this as a theory, we come to the story now
 samajhane main aasaani ho to ham ise binduon main dekhenge
 In this, let us first understand the basic issue briefly
 jajon kii niyukti ke liye bhaajapa netritv vaali (pichhali) NDA sarkaar ne sansad se rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog kaa kaanoon paas karaayaa
 The Commission, comprising and transferring judges to the Supreme Court and High Court, was to have 6 members in which the Chief Justice of India (CJI) was made the chairman, in addition to the two senior most judges of the Supreme Court, the Law Minister and two prominent people
 Had to be made
 in do logon kaa chayan CJI, pradhanmantri or loksabhaa main vipaksh kii sabase badi party ke netaa se bani ek chayan samiti ko karnaa tha
 The bill, which was amended by the 99th Constitution Amendment, was passed by Parliament with a two-thirds majority from both houses
 yani sattadhari dal ke saath-saath vipaksh bhi isamen saath tha
 Not only this, it was the third kind of amendment under Constitution Amendment 368 which requires a special majority of two-thirds as well as the consent of more than half of the states
 isamen 20 rajyon kii sahmati lee gai thi
 But after the Parliament passed both houses and agreed upon 20 states, a five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional
 aasaan bhashaa main samajha jaae to is bill ke peeche kitna bada janamat tha, jise nakaar diya gaya
 - We do not want to read the first page of the constitution but keep an opinion on the appointment of judges
 "modi sarkaar nyaaypalika kii shaktiyaan kam karne par amada he", aisa kehete hue NJAC ko asanvaidhanik ghoshit karne vaale supreme court ke faisle par 'khushiyaan' manaai gayi
 - We do not think that the UPA-2 (congress) initiative like NJAC was done, it also brought the bill for it, it was sent to the Standing Committee during his tenure
 - ham nahin jaananaa chaahate ki UPA ke bill main bhi lagbhag vahi praavdhaan the, jo NDA ke bill main the
 The appointment of the judges was planned with the joint involvement of the judiciary and the executive
 bas uskaa naam thodaa alag nyaayik niyukti ayog (JAC) tha
 - We do not want to know that there is no 'collegium' system anywhere in the Constitution
 vyavastha chhodie, collegium jaisaa koi shabd hi samvidhan main nahin he
 - Judiciary and executive will be appointed jointly by judges, this is at the core of the constitution
 savindhan ke anuchhed 124(2) ke anusaar “ucchtam nyaayalay ke or rajyon ke ucch nyaayalayon ke aise nyaayadhishon se paraamarsh karne ke pashchaat, jinase raashtrapati is prayojan ke liye paraamarsh karnaa aavashyak samajhen, raashtrapati apane hastakshar or mudra sahit adhipatr dwaara ucchtam nyaayalay ke prayek nyaayadhish ko niyukt karegaa
 "in this article with the appointment of judges, it is clearly written that the President" considers it necessary to consult ", that is, the President has to be appointed, the Chief Justice will only advise
 lekin paraamarsh kaa matlab kya hoga? kya vah badhyakaari hoga yaa sirf salaahkaari, iskaa faisla first jajej cese main hua jab teen jajon vaali bench ne nirnay diya ki paraamarsh kaa matlab sahmati nahin he
 This means the President is supreme and he is not bound to act as advised
 is cese tak jajon kii niyukti main karypalika kii prabhavi bhoomika thi
 We can also call it an equal share role
 dekha jaae to yah faisla ek tarah se nyaaypalika ne apni shaktiyon ke viruddh hi diya tha
 But the story changed 180 degrees after the second case
 - Second or phir Third Judges Case main samvidhan kii is mul aatma se aapane aap ko na sirf dur kiya, balki aatma ko 'dafn' kar diya
 In the 2nd Judges case, the 'advice' given to the President in the appointment of judges was made 'binding'
 is cese ne 9 jajon kii peeth ne first jajej cese ko 7:2 se palat diya
 - The case of the 'balance' of the executive and the judiciary, which the Constitution makers had talked about in the appointment of judges, not only broke the other scales of the scales but also established their supremacy over it
 - First Judges Case tak jajon kii niyukti main karypalika kii bhoomika thi lekin Second Judges Case se jajon kii niyukti main karypalika kii koi bhoomika nahin rahi isamen 9 jajon vaali peeth ne nirnay diya ki supreme court ho yaa hai court, kisi bhi jaj kii niyukti bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish kii raay ke anuroop hi kii ja sakati he, anyathaa nahin
 In the Third Case, the same opinion of the Chief Justice was converted into a 'collegium' and now the Chief Justice had to consult 4 other judges and choose on the basis of majority
 yaheen se us collegium kaa janm hua, jo aaj tak chalaa aa rahaa he
 In 2013, the UPA government introduced a bill for the formation of the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC), its structure was exactly like the NDA
 vah bhi chha: sadasyon vaala ayog bananaa tha, antar bas itnaa tha ki UPA-2 dwaara laae gaye vidheyak se aage jaakar NDA ke vidheyak main janemaane vyaktiyon main se ek ko anusuchit jati, janajati, anya pichhadaa varg, alpsankhyak or mahila main se chunanaa tha
 Actually, this provision was also included on the suggestion of the Standing Committee on the previous (UPA) Bill
 - agar ham NDA-UPA ko chhod or peeche jaaen to saal 1987 main vidhi ayog ne aaj ke NJAC jaisaa hi nyaayik ayog banane kaa suzav diya tha
 In 1990, the Bill was again introduced to constitute this National Judicial Commission
 - 2002 main bane neshnal kamishan tu rivyuu da varking of da constitution, jise saral hindi main samvidhan samiksha ayog bhi kaha jaataa he, ne bhi jajon kii niyukti ke liye ayog ke gathan kaa suzav diya tha
 The National Advisory Council (NAC), formed in 2005 under the leadership of UPA chief Sonia Gandhi, also suggested for a similar commission
 - sabase ant main, saal 2007 main bane dwitiya prashasnic sudhaar ayog (2nd ARC) ne bhi apni report main ise doharaaya
 - The Executive Commission was included in all the Appointments Commission suggested by all these Commissions / Councils
 samvidhan samiksha ayog ko chhod diya jaae to sabhi ne hoicourt main jajon kii niyukti main mukhyamantri ko bhi shaamil karne kaa suzav diya tha
 The legislature was also included in the NAC and 2nd ARC with Sonia Gandhi
 - supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne 4:1 se NDA sarkaar dwaara laae gaye NJAC ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya
 (this bench included Justice J
 chelmeshwar ne isse sahmati jataai thi)
