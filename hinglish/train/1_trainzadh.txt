 sonaali phogot tik tok par hai kaaphi fameskuladeep bishnoi bole-raajnneeti ke jariye haraayengeharyana vidhansabha chunaav main kai siton par congress, bijepi, jananaayak janata party or indian neshnal lokdal ke ummidavaaron ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 The BJP has fielded the Bhajanlal family and former TV actress Sonali Phogat, called Tick Talk Queen from Adampur, the stronghold of Kuldeep Bishnoi, currently in the Congress
 sonaali phogot tik tok par kaaphi femesahai
 The videos made on his Hindi film songs on Tick Talk went viral as soon as BJP announced him as its candidate from Adampur
 kuch logon ne soshal media par sonaali phogot ko trol kiya to kai logon ne unke video ko lekar alag-alag baaten likhni shuru kar di
 'I have been active in politics for 12 years' and all these things do not see any effect on Sonali Phogat
 adampur sebijapi ummidavaar sonaali phogaatane kaha, 'jaise hi bijepi ne mere naam par tikat kaa elaan kiya vaise hi mujhe pataa laga ki soshal media par mere tik tok ke video viral kiye ja rahe hai
 i have been active in politics for the last 12 years but acting is my profession and i can never leave this profession of acting
 isi vajah se tik tok ke madhyam se main apana shauk puraa karti hum
 Sonali Phogat further said, 'many things are being said about my Tick Talk video, but i have definitely fulfilled my acting passion in these videos but have never crossed my civilization and dignity
 'kuldeep bishnoi par bolaa hamalasonali phogot ne congress ummidavaar kuldeep bishnoi par bhi tikhe hamale bole or kaha, 'pichley kareeb 50 saal se bhajanlaal or unke parivaar kaa adampur kii seat par dabadabaa he
 i think Bhajanlal did good work but now Kuldeep Vishnoi gets his votes by tricking the people of Adampur in the name of Bhajanlal and by blackmailing him emotionally
 'aage phogot ne kaha, 'mujhe bahari bataane vaale kuldeep bishnoi khud hi apane vidhansabha kshetra main nahin rahete hai
 He is a businessman
 apane bijness ke liye wo zyaadaatar vakt videshon main rahete hai jabaki main adampur kii hum
 i was born in Adampur
 adampur main meri sampatti he or main adampur main hi zyada vakt rahati hum
 Sonali Phogat said, "if i become an MLA, i will continue my acting profession even after that and i will also make videos of my tick talk, but the videos of that time would be more of message to the youth than film songs
" vahiin ye bhi sach he ki main apane acting ke profeshan nahin chhoduungi
 He said, 'I am an actor first and then come into politics after that
 isi vajah se main raajnneeti ke saath apane acting ke profeshan ko bhi jari rakhuungi
 The way the people of Hisar and Adampur know about me, what property i have, everyone knows how much land is there
 'kuldeep bishnoi kaa palatwaradampur se congress ummidavaar kuldeep bishnoi ne bhi sonaali phogot par palatwaar karte hue kaha, 'tik tok ke video se aap fain to bana sakate hai lekin iskaa ye katai matlab nahin ki wo fain vot main bhi tabdeel honge
 Work has to be done to get votes
 'saath hi unhone kaha, 'bhajanlaal parivaar ne lagaataar kshetra main kaam kiya he
 The public's trust in our family is based on the work that my father did and the work i have done for this area
 lagaataar hamaare parivaar ko yahaan kii janata jitati rahi he
 'kuldeep Bishnoi said,' Sonali Phogat is definitely in this area, but people of many villages here will not even know the name
 ' sonaali ke viral videos par kuldeep bishnoi ne kaha, 'maine apane kaaryakartaaon ko kaha he ki sonaali phogot ke videos ko lekar koi bhi abhadra baat likhakar viral naa kii jaae
 That is his personal life and we should respect the personal life of everyone and if we have to defeat him, we will defeat him in elections through politics
 'adampur ke logon kaa kya he kahana?haalanki adampur kii jamini hakeekat jaanane ke liye jab ajtak kii team ne adampur main maujuud logon se baat kii to logon ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaam kii to tarif kii
 On the other hand, BJP candidate Sonali Phogat said, 'even though his videos are quite popular on social media, he is like a parachute candidate for Adampur
 logon kaa kahana he ki bijepi ne adampur jaisi seat par congress ko takkar dene ke liye galat ummidavaar kaa chayan kar liya he or bijepi ke kisi sthaneey netaa ko hi ummidavaar banaaya janaa chahie tha
 People said that their displeasure is definitely with Kuldeep Bishnoi, but on seeing Sonali Phogat coming out in front of them, it seems that Kuldeep Bishnoi will benefit
 vahiin kai logon kaa kahana he ki vah sonaali phogot ke video to soshal media par dekh chuke hai lekin wo sonaali phogot ke bare main in videos ke alaava or kuch nahin jaanate hai
 Whose hand will win? Overall, Adampur is one such seat
 jahaan par bijepi har haal main bhagava laharaana chaahati he lekin sonaali phogot ko jis tarah se aage kiya gaya he use dekhakar lagata he sonaali phogot par parachute candidet hone kaa thappa lag chukaa he
 Anyway, Sonali wanted to contest from bjp's ticket from Nalwa Assembly constituency of Hisar but the party did not give ticket from there and sent it to Adampur
 ab 24 oktober ko matganana ke baad hi saaf ho paaegaa ki kya sonaali phogot kaa charchit cheharaa or unke viral videos voton main tabdeel hote hai yaa nahin

 The Railway Claims Tribunal and Consumer Forum can provide a substantial compensation to the passenger along with giving back the ticket money from the railway

 Similarly, if dissatisfied with the decision of the Consumer Forum, an appeal can be made to the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission

 kabhi koi kisi purush se yah nahin poochta ki vah apni patni ko kab pregnent kar rahaa he! main pichley 10 maheenon main aa rahi pregnancy kii khabaron se tang aa gai hum

 She says, 'being an actress and public figure, i have accepted that people would like to infiltrate their personal lives
 main jaanati hum ki log isamen ruchi lete hai or anumaan lagaate rahete hai
 i don't have any problem with this, but this time the lines of decorum were crossed
 main pareshaan hui, kyonki har maheene meri pregnancy se judi ek nai kahani saamne aane lagi

 india today conklev east 2018 ke chauthe satr di great eastern hope main kendriya mantri babul supriyo ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Padmaja Joshi
 is dauraan unhone pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that Bengal does not need hardcore politics, as Mamata didi is doing
 ramanavami banaam moharrm par bolte hue babul ne kaha ki pashchim bengal main ramanavami ko bijepi lekar nahin ai he
 BJP is not born in West Bengal
 ramanavami ko rajya ke logon ne khud chunaa he
 Babul said that in Moharram we used to think how someone could injure themselves so much with a whip
 unhone kaha ki jab bhi mujhe najar lagati thi to moulana meri najar utaarte the
 Babul Supriyo said that the notion of him being a problem maker is completely wrong
 babul ne kaha ki raniganj dange ke samay vah kamare main band hokar nahin baithna chaahate the
 Mamta was spoiling the communal atmosphere outside and it was very important for her to get out of the house
 babul ne kaha ki dange se sthaan par vah police ke pahunchane ke baad nahin balki pehle aae the vahiin police vaale duusare ilaake main baith kar chaay pi rahe the
 Babul said that in Bengal, he is not fighting with the Trinamool Congress but for equality
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki panchayat chunaavon ke baad se mamata pareshaan hai or vah vipaksh ko thaamne ke liye kuch bhi karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Babul Supriyo said that the whole country is watching the situation of violence in Bengal but why is it that things like Tier Gas and Water canon are never used in West Bengal
 babul ne daawa kiya ki rajya sarkaar pehle upadriyon ko puri chhot detii he or jab vah danga fasaad or aagjanee kar lete hai tab unhen ek ghante kaa samay maukey se bhaagane kaa diya jaataa he
 Only after this, the police in the state arrive at the place of some incident
 hinsa par bolte hue babul ne kaha ki bijepi ke paas masal power nahin he ki vah rajya kii in takaton se lard sake
 But the people of the state are now understanding these forces and have an undercurrent against them and they themselves are ready to respond to their violence
 babul ne kaha ki dangon kii jagah par crude bamon kii supplai tiemasi ke offis se kii jaati he
 The government in the state has made a formula to run things on its own in this way and the police are never allowed to stand for justice
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki mamata banerjee ne sarkaar kii takat kaa galat istemaal karne kaa kaam kiya he
 Babul said that Mamta didi may lead a normal life but she is letting such things grow around her
 vah saamaanya si chappal or neeli sari pahenti hai lekin hinsa ke raast par chalati hai
 More violence than in West Bengal is in UP and Bihar, according to the Home Ministry data
 babul ne kaha ki rajya main home ministry rajya kaa subject he or bengal main kyon rajya sarkaar kendra ko aankada degi ki vahaan hinsa ho rahi he

 Will current India captain Virat Kohli demolish Sachin Tendulkar's record of most runs and centuries in odis and Tests? Australian legend Glenn Magra has once again given rise to this debate
 unhone in donon bhartiya ballebaajon ke vajan ko mapa or atakalon ko viraam dene kii maang karte hue kaha ki maujuuda bhartiya test captain viraat kohli cricket ke maidan par master blaster sachin tendulkar ke kiye karnaamon kii barabari kar sakate hai
 It is not pleasing to compare himself with Sachin because he respects him a lot
 viraat ne to yahaan tak kaha ki sachin se tulana karne par unhen sharmindagi mahasoos hoti he
 But the way you are batting, this comparison will continue to work more or less
 hamane viraat kohli ke vartmaan record or sachin tendulkar ke tab ke records ko dekha or jo nattejey paae wo chaunkaa dene vaale hai
 The funny thing is that Virat Kohli's pace of scoring runs is on the track that he will destroy his Test and ODI records faster than the master blaster
 yahaan ek baat gauratlab he ki sachin ne keval ek tii20 antarrashtriya match khelaa he jabaki 135
 Virat, who has scored 1,658 runs in 45 matches at a strike rate of 57, is the betazabadshah of this format
 tii20 main viraat ke 57
 The average of 17 runs is more than any current cricketer who has scored more than a thousand runs
 vanade main sachin par viraat hai barisfed gend viraat ko zyada bhaati he
 We are not talking about the figures of Virat in ODI cricket
 171 match khel chuke viraat kaa ausat yahaan 51
 It is 51
 ab tak wo 25 pariyon ke dauraan tihare ank main bhi pahunch chuke hai
 During this time he has scored 7,212 runs
 ab is mukaam par agar sachin tendulkar ke aankade dekhe jaaen to wo viraat se koso peeche hai
 Until playing the same ODI, Sachin Tendulkar is less than half of Virat i
e
 only 12 centuries and 38
 85 kii ausat se mahaj 5,828 ran banaae the
 However, after this, Sachin Tendulkar increased his number of odis to 463 by playing 292 odis and 44 by the time he retired
 83 kii ausat se kul 18,426 ran banaae
 Sachin scored a total of 49 centuries during his ODI career
 agar viraat isi raftaar se khelte rahe to nishchit hi sachin tendulkar ke record ko unke jitne match khilne se kahin pehle tod denge
 Virat will hit at least 63 ODI centuries Now the question arises that with the speed at which Virat is scoring, how many centuries can he score during his career? We have come to the conclusion by doing the usual multiplication division that if Virat Kohli also plays ODI equal to Sachin, then he will score a mountain of 19,527 runs with 63 centuries
 ab agar sachin kii hi tarah yahaan se unke balle se or adhik ran barasane lage to yah record kis oonchai par pahonchega yah kahana mushkil he
 Sachin is better than Sachin in the Test In the long format of Virat Cricket, Sachin Tendulkar scored 51 centuries but for this he also played 200 Tests
 agar viraat kohli ke vartmaan record ko dekhen to wo is mukaam par sachin se aage nikal gaye hai
 So far, Virat has scored 3,245 runs in 45 Tests
 unka ausat 45
 Is of 06 and he has also scored 12 Test centuries
 jabaki itane hi test khilne tak sachin ne viraat se do shatak kam yani 10 centuri ke saath 3,087 ran banaae the
 Sachin 50 of course
 60 ranon kii ausat ke saath viraat se kahin aage the
 There is no doubt that with 100 centuries in international cricket, Sachin is one of the all-time great players of cricket but we keep seeing the biggest records on the cricket field being destroyed and the confidence and chic with which Virat Cricket's He is proving to be the dwarf to the greatest bowlers on the pitch and looking at his above comparative study done from Little Genius, i have to say No Skil he let his master's steps will be overtaken
 philhal vakt he viraat kii shandaar ballebaaji or team india kii captaini karte hue unke adbhut nirnyon ko dekhne or uskaa lutf uthaane kaa

 India's national security adviser Ajit Doval is arriving in Beijing on Thursday amid the ongoing standoff with China over Doklam
 dobhaal kaa yah daura yun to bricks enese baithak ke liye he, lekin ise donon deshon ke bich jari tanaav ko khatm karne se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 In fact, BRICS is headed by China and President Xi Jinping has called a meeting of security advisors from all five BRICS member states (brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)
 isi ke tahat shi jinping shuukravaar subah in suraksha salaahkaaron se mulaakaat karenge
 At the same time, apart from this BRICS meeting, Ajit Doval will also meet Chinese President Xi Jinping
 chini adhikariyon ke mutabik, shuukravaar dopaher ko yah baithak hogi
 According to the sources, during this period, the issue of the latest dispute regarding the border may arise

 a month-long agitation over Doklam is reported to have triggered the deadlock over the Doklam area when Indian troops stopped the Chinese army from building a road in the area
 iske baad donon deshon ke sainik pichley ek maheene se zyada vakt se aamane-saamne hai
 Here, China claims that it is building a road in its territory, while India fears that China is forcibly constructing a road in the region of Bhutan to ease access to the states of Northeast India and that is why it interfered is

 However, he also believes that negotiations are taking place through diplomatic route and in such a situation, Doval's visit is being seen as the link of ongoing dialogue behind this curtain

 sarkaar ke is nakad tohfe ko gaiyr jaruri bataate hue ashok khemka ne haryana civil seva ke chapter 5 ke niyam 50 kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki sarkari karmchaariyon ko maandey sirf bahut hi khaas kaam karne par miltaa he or uski seemaa sirf 10 hajaar rupye tak hoti he
 But on the occasion of Diwali, Manohar Lal Khattar has opened government treasuries for his personal staff

 Some people are being given ₹ 7 xxrep 4 0 arguments, which is against the rules
 ashok khemka ne apni hi sarkaar kii khinchaai ho karte hue kaha he ki diwali ke naam par diya ja rahaa maandey na keval niyamon ke khilaaf he balki karmchaariyon ke ek varg vishesh ko diya ja rahaa he jo pratiniyukti yani deputesan par hai
 Most of the employees who are being given cash Diwali gifts worth thousands of rupees are posted in the Chief Minister's Office, Chief Minister's residence and the Chief Minister's security
 kuch din pehle ashok khemka ne khatter cabinet ke mantri krishna bedi ko saal bhar apane vibhaag kii ek jeep ke durupyog par khari khoti sunai thi or unako imaanadaaree kaa paath padhaayaa tha
 The minister next day handed over the jeep to the department

 The BJP, which is in power at the Center, is also a partner of power in Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin chunauti yaheen se shuru hoti he
 BJP or say Modi cannot leave Abkashmir as a state ruled by an opposition party and neglected

 In which there is a compulsion to talk to Pakistan and Kashmiri separatists on the one hand and on the other the tense situation of the state

 Then when some mission is found, whether it is from a terrorist organization or ISI, they also turn to India

 Which he has been doing for years

 The Arabic word hurriyat means freedom

 Almost all the big leaders of the All Party Hurriyat Conference are closer to Islamabad than Delhi
 unhen pakistan or arab deshon se acchhee-khaasi funding hoti he
 So that they can dissolve tension in Kashmir peace when needed
 jab bharat sarkaar naksaliyon ko koi sidhi baat nahin karti, to hurriyat ko kyon manyata detii rahi he
 Is the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan a cause for concern? us-led NATO forces are moving from Afghanistan

 Kashmir is the valley or Jammu and Ladakh too? Kashmir's separatists only talk about Kashmir valley
 unki vichaardhaara ko jammu or ladakh main bilkul tavajjo nahin milti
 National Conference and PDP have also mostly worked on this line
 haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main to pidipi ko ghati se hi siten mili hai
 The question now arises as to whether his concern is confined only to his voters and his feelings in the valley
 bharat ke lakhon iti profeshnal kii taraf se liye jane vaale h1-bvijamem badlaav ko lekar america ne apana rukh saaf kiya he
 He has said that there has been no change in the rules for the issuance of this visa
 america or bharat ke bich agle saptaah nai dilli main 2+2 baithak honi he
 Earlier, the Trump administration has issued this statement regarding H1-B visa
 nai dilli main hone vaali is baithak main videsh mantrisushamaa swarajvija kaa mudda uthaa sakati hai
 Sushma Swaraj had said in the Rajya Sabha last month to put India's side before the US in this regard
 unhone kaha tha, ''ham is mudde ko alag-alag manchon par aupchaarik rup se uthaa rahe hai
 We are talking to the White House, the administration of US states and lawmakers on this
 ''sushamaa ne is dauraan bataaya tha ki 6 sitambar koni dillimein hone vaali baithak main bhi H1-B vija kaa mudda uthaaya jayega
 He had said that we will raise this issue politely in the meeting
 america prashasanke ek adhikari ne naam na jaahir karne kii shart par kaha, '' bharat ke paas is baithak main vija mudde par kuch kehane kaa nahin rah jayega
 Because there has been no change in the policies of this visa
 ''adhikari ne bataaya ki 'trump prashasan kii taraf se jo kaaryakari aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 It has ordered a large-scale review of the US visa program to work here
 ''unhone bataaya kivija samikshakarne kaa lakshya yah sunishchit karnaa he ki isse america ke karmi or unhen milane vaala vetan prabhavit naa ho
 Bharatiya Janata Party veteran Murali Manohar Joshi has almost been denied the ticket
 bijepi ne is baar laalkrishna adwani kii tarah hi murali manohar joshi ko tikat nahin diya he
 It is being told that party general secretary Ramlal himself informed Murali Manohar and asked him to go to the party office and announce it
 magar murali manohar joshi ne chunaav na ladane kaa elaan karne se saaf inkaar kar diya or unhone kanpur ke votaron ke liye ek patr likhaa or isaki soochna di ki raamalaal unhen chunaav na ladane ke liye kah rahe hai
 It is believed that Murali Manohar Joshi's ticket from Kanpur is almost cut off from the BJP and he will not be seen in the election arena this time like Advani
 kareebi sutron kii maane to murali manohar joshi ko jitna dukh unke tikat kaate jane kii soochna se nahin he, utana use pahunchaae jane ke tareeke se he
 Murali Manohar Joshi says that he would have liked if BJP President Amit Shah himself had come to tell his decision to cut his ticket
 darasal, jab bijepi mahasachiv raamalaal ne murali manohar joshi ko tikat kaate jane kii soochna di to chunaav na ladane kaa khud se elaan karne ke liye murali manohar joshi kii tarah laal krishna adwani bhi taiyaar nahin hue
 Like Murali Manhor Joshi had told Ram Lal if party president Amit Shah himself had come and told the decision of the party
 bataa den ki alke adwani ne bhi kaha tha ki agar amit shah unhen faisla bataane aate to acha lagata
 After the party's decision, Murali Manohar Joshi wrote a letter to his voters in Kanpur and said that Ramlal was asking him not to contest
 isse pehle ram laal laalkrishna adwani, calraj mishra se mulaaqaat kar chuke hai
 On the other hand, Shanta Kumar and Kariya Munda told the decision of the party leadership on the phone that you should declare for yourself that you do not want to contest elections
 iske baad calraj mishra, shanta kumaar or kariya munda ne khud ghoshnaa kii ki ve chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai
 But Murali Manohar Joshi and LK Advani are refusing to announce themselves
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bijepi ne umr kaa hawala dekar laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi samet kai bujurg netaaon ke tikat kaate hai
 Earlier on Monday, LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi did not figure in the list of star campaigners released by the BJP for UP
 mana ja rahaa he ki badhati umr kii vajah se hi ab bijepi main adwani or murali manohar joshi kii andekhi ho rahi he

 On the day of Ekadashi one should not sweep the house, because there is a fear of death of ants and other micro-organisms

 Because the notification under which 21 parliamentary secretaries were made in March 2015 clearly stated that the parliamentary secretary will get a place to work in the office of the minister with whom the parliamentary secretary will be connected, but the government's request for room in the assembly It means that Parliamentary Secretaries were asked to provide separate rooms, as well as giving furniture means that it will also cost money

 bijepi kii sahyogi party shivasena ne ek baar phir se bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Shiv Sena has accused BJP of adopting a dual policy
 shivasena ne desh main ‘ghor ashishnutaa’ sambandhi bayanon ko lekar abhinaytashahrukh khanko nishaanaa banane vaale bijepi ke kuch virgon kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki abhinayta ko ‘pakistan jane’ ke liye kehane se party kii ‘dohari niti’ jaahir hoti he
 The Shiv Sena in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana' said, "the BJP member and Chief Minister (devendra Fadnavis) had invited Ghulam Ali to perform in the state amidst complete security
" is tarah ek ore aap aamantrit karte hai or duusari ore aap shahrukh khan ko pakistan jane ke liye kehete hai
 a dual policy is being adopted at this time
 shahrukh ek kalakaar hai or unhen keval musalmaan hone ke kaaran nishaanaa bananaa sahi nahin he
 The editorial further noted that the controversy over the Bollywood superstar's remarks has masked the faces of those who opposed the Shiv Sena's protest against Ghulam Ali's concert and former Pakistan minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri's book release in Mumbai
 Were criticizing him for usne kaha, ‘raajnneetigyon ko sahishnutaa evam ashishnutaa ke mudde ko lekar sirf isliye hi shahrukh ko nahin ghaseetna chahie kyonki vah musalmaan hai
 Those who said that India's reputation for the issue of Ghulam Ali and Khurshid has been hurt, their masks have gone off after the Shah Rukh episode
 ’darasal,bijepi netaa kailash vijayawargiyane mangalvaar ko ek twit ke jariye vivaad paidaa kar diya tha
 He said in his tweet that Shah Rukh lived in India but his 'soul' was in Pakistan
 unki is tippanee se ek din pehle hi shahrukh ne kaha tha ki desh main ‘ghor ashishnutaa’ he
 Vijayvargiya had withdrawn his controversial tweets after being targeted due to his comments but insisted that if there was intolerance in India, Shah Rukh would not have been the most popular actor after Amitabh Bachchan

 Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena said that it will continue to oppose social, cultural and political relations with Pakistan until the neighboring country retains its antics
 shivasena ne kaha ki party jo kar rahi he, vah darasal logon kii bhaawanaaon kii hi abhivyakti he
 Shiv Sena said, 'ghulam Ali says that he will not come to India until the relationship between the two countries improves
 ham unke is ruukh kii saraahna karte hai or ummid karte hai ki vah apane ruukh par dridhtaa ke saath kaayam rahenge
 Meanwhile, he can play the role of a peacekeeper and try to replace Hafiz Saeed and other terrorists who are sitting in Pakistan and spewing venom against India

 However, many leaders of Andhra Pradesh are still opposed to Telangana

 unhone kaha tha, ‘ham telugana kaa samarthan karte hai
 The BJP is ready for the formation of the state
 ’ bhaajapa netaa kehete rahe hai ki yadi bhaajapa aam chunaavon ke baad satta main ai to vah telugana rajya kaa gathan karegi
 But the Congress has more difficulty inside

 fasebuk ne data li maamle main bharat sarkaar ke nae notice par apana jawaab de diya he
 In this, Facebook said that it has made what changes to keep the information of the users safe
 haalanki, britain kii cambridge analitica ne abhi tak sarkaar ke duusare notice kaa aupchaarik rup se jawaab nahin diya he
 An information technology ministry official said that a decision in this regard will be taken only after getting answers from both

 hamane phek acounts, vigyaapan main paardarshita badhaane or farji khabaron kii chintaa ko bhi dur karne kaa prayaas kiya he

 (input-bhashaa) Living from one city to another is not an easy task
 aap jis jagah kii ek-ek gali se waakif hon, us jagah kii yaaden aapako nae shahar main chaiyn se ek pal rahane nahin detii hai
 Apart from this, it is not easy to adapt yourself to the new city
 khaskar us dauraan jab aap naukari karne yaa padhai karne shahar aate hai
 In such a situation, the conflict increases further
 agar aap ek se duusare shahar ja rahe hai, khaastaur par chote shahar se kisi metro main, to ye pareshaaniyaan aapke saamne aa sakati hai:1
 What to take away The problem begins with packing
 jab aap ghar chhodane lagate hai to aisa mahasoos karte hai ki apane jarurat ke saamaanon ko do-teen bag main sametanaa aasaan nahin he
 You remove the item again and again and keep it again
 har saamaan ko rakhana us samay jaruri lagane lagata he, lekin sab saath le janaa sambhav nahin hota he
 2
 kahaan talaashen ghardusri pareshanine shahar main ghar talashne kihoti he
 Small towns have a habit of living in a big house
 vahiin metro city main ek kamare main aapako duniya basaani hoti he
 a roommate has to be shared with a roommate
 yahi nahin, agar aap piji main rahete hai to pareshaaniyon kaa ant nahin he
 You are always looking for a good and cheap house in the new city
 3
 It is the turn of friends after home to find new friends
 nae shahar main dost bananaa aasaan kaam nahin he kyonki yahaan koi aapke bare main jaanata he
 You will soon become friends in colleges
 lekin agar aap naukari karne aae hai to dost bananaa mushkil he
 If you are lucky and your friendship is with someone, then there will be no guarantee of how many days will last
 4
 Wandering of unknown place in the city for a week, your mind becomes empty
 yani aapako kuch bhi samaj main nahin aata he ki ho kya rahaa he
 5
 khaane kii pareshaandgar aap khaane ke shaukeen hai to aapke liye nae shahar main mushkil kam hone ke bajaay bad jaati he
 You start looking for places in the city where food and drink of your choice are found
 6
 People coming from the small town of Tehzeeb also experience cultural shock (cultural) when they come to big cities
 har shahar kii apni tahjeeb hoti he or nae maahaul main edjust karnaa sabhi ke liye asaan nahin hota
 7
 raaston kii bhulbhulaiyabade shaharon main aksar raste pataa karne main aapkaa vakt nikal jaataa he
 Suppose you have come to Delhi, then you will have to master the metro stations
 mumbai main hai to local hi ab aapaki life line hogi
 Without understanding this life line, your work is not going to work
 8
 Remembering the house, as soon as you walk around the city and come to your bed peacefully at night, the memory of the house starts
 baar-baar mummy-papa or apane doston ko phone karte hai
 Where earlier there was no money to give a missed call in your phone, now you start recharging on recharge
 9
 Every job has to be done by yourself
 When you are alone in a city, you have many other responsibilities ranging from your belongings to your shoulders
 akelaa rahanaa aapkoatmanirbharbana detaa he
 Initially it may be painful but it proves beneficial for your life
 10
 New language has to be adopted, in a new city, you have to be two to four from the language there
 khaastaur par frej ke short form, jaise ki titiwiel (tok tu you letters), pikchar (picks), eneefdblyoo (note sef for work), jeenef yani (just for fan), vyakti ko banda or kai saare aise nae shabdon ko sunanaa or unka matlab jaananaa ek nayaa anubhav hota he
 11
 sukun kii talashshahar kii bheed se pareshaan hokar kai baar aisa bhi samay aata he, jab aapkaa man kisi park main akele baithkar chupchaap kisi ped yaa paudhe ko dekhne ko karegaa

 Nokia ne dubaara vaapasi ke baad ab tak bharat main chaar android launch kiye hai
 These include mid range and high end smartphones
 ab intjaar he company ke bajet smartphone kii jo shaomi se takkar le sake
 Therefore, the company can launch Nokia 2 in India tomorrow
 haalanki isaki koi bhi aadhikarik jaankaree nahin he
 The license to manufacture Nokia's handsets is now on HMD Global which has started sending media invites
 31 oktober ko yah event he
 According to the company, the next milestone of Nokia phones will be introduced on this day
 is smartphone ko america retailor kii website par dekha gaya tha
 It is written here for $ 99
 reports ke mutabik is phone ko haal hi main rus mencertification mila he or agle maheene iskaa aadhikarikelaan ho saktaa hai
 Significantly, Finland company HMD Global has a license to manufacture Nokia's smartphones and the company is constantly trying to bring back the old Nokia once again
 philhal is smartphone kii zyada jaankaree to saamne nahin ai he , lekin darj detel ke mutabik isamen 4,000 mah kii powerful bydaree lagi he
 Apart from this, the news is that Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 or 212 chipset can be given in it
 retailor kii website par iskaa product number TA-1035 diya gaya
 It has dual sim support
 tasviir or kuch darj jaankariyon ko dekhen to kah sakate hai ki isamen 5 inch kii disple diya ja saktaa he or isaki internal memory 8GB yaa 16GB kii ho sakati he
 However, micro SD card support will be provided in it
 philhal company ne aadhikarik taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 If it launches in India, Xiaomi will surely have some difficulty, because Xiaomi is far ahead in terms of the smartphone of this segment
 Nokia 2 ko haal hi main benchmark antutu par dekha gaya jahaan iske spacifications bhi darj hai
 Here its codename is TA 1035
 haalanki isamen sirf chand jaankariyaan hi hai
 However, in some reports, it is also being said that Nokia can launch its mid-range smartphone Nokia 7 in India on October 31, which has recently been launched in China
 makaan kii registry or raajnneetik vafadaari main ab koi fark nahin rahaa
 The way you make a sale on stamp paper while buying and selling your house, now it is being written by writing on the same stamp paper that we will remain loyal to our leader
 polytics din-raat kisi film kii tarah chal rahi he
 The hero of a few films used to claim to carry a resignation in the pocket, but 44 mlas of the West Bengal Congress have exhausted all their chances of joining another party or being loyal to another leader by writing on stamp paper
 100 rupee ke stamp paper par 44 congressi vidhayakon ne likhaa he, magar isse pashchim bengal rajasav vibhaag ko maatr 4,400 rupee kaa hi aay hua he
 Petrol mlas of more than this would have burnt people in starting their car
 halafname main likhaa he ki, 'yahaan tak ki agar main party kii niti yaa faisle se sahamat nahin hone par bhi nakaaratmak tippanee nahin karuunga yaa party ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye nakaaratmak kadam nahin uthaaungaa
 i will resign from my post of MLA before making such remarks or taking action
 ' These affidavits were not brought by Congress mlas from their homes
 baithak main aae to congress adhyaksh adheer ranjan choudhary ne unhen diya or unhone dastakhat kar die
 Thick Fat was unanimously decided
 ek-do vidhayak baithak khatm hone se pehle chale gaye the, unke dastakhat nahin hai
 The affidavit states, "as an MLA, i will follow the party's guidelines and as an MLA, the leader will follow the guidelines of the opposition
 vidhansabha main chif wheep kaa bhi paalan karuunga
 " is tarah se halafname ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko samarpit kar diya gaya he
 This in itself is a case of wonder
 halafname main vidhayakon ne sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke prati sampurna nishtha rakhane kaa vaada kiya he
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien wrote that such an affidavit is bizarre in itself
 derek o bryan ne raajnneetik dal ko paribhaashit karte hue likhaa he ki ek raajnneetik dal samaan soch rakhane vaale logon kaa swechha se bana sanghathan hota he
 They all believe in the same principle
 kya congress ko khud main bharosa nahin rahaa ki wo apane vidhayakon se halafanama maang rahi he
 Derek o'brien praised the Trinamool Congress for this
 enditivi dot com par apane lekh main derek ne kaha he ki haal ke itihaas main congress se nikal kar apni party banaakar ek alag raajnneetik andolan chalaane vaali mamata banerjee ekmaatr netaa hai
 While talking about the Congress, the MP has started speaking about his party
 jaise ki tivi bahason main hota he
 The first line is criticized, the rest of the line is self-praise
 bangla congress, tamil manila congress, congress tiwari se lekar rashtravaadi congress party sabakaa itihaas or safalataa ke paimaane ko derek ne gina diya
 It is obvious that the Congress gave an opportunity to count
 ginate-ginate ve aakhri paragraph main waapas halfmane vaale masale par aate hai or likhte hai ki kuch log is halafname ke bare main kah rahe hai ki yah chotii ke netaaon ke khilaaf baghaavat rokane ke liye he, jahaan party main surgery kii zarurat par jor diya ja rahaa he
 There is concern at the local level that these mlas may not go to the Trinamool Congress
 jaisaa ki ateet main hua he or chunaav se pehle adheer choudhary ne aisi ashanka bhi jataai he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has said that people in the Congress party are captives of the Gandhi family
 kuch dal ke log likhakar nishtha jataa rahe hai to kuch dal ke log nishtha jataane ke liye aisi-aisi baaten bol de rahe hai ki likhane main kaaphi acha lagata he
 In March this year, in a meeting of bjp's national executive in March, he said that Prime Minister Modi is a gift of God to India
 ve garib logon ke maseehaa hai
 The challenges of every sector are inherited and they are trying to meet those challenges
 isse pehle 2014 ke saal main bhartiya saanskrithik sambandh parishad ke chairman lokesh chandra ne kaha tha- modi ji garibon ke liye bhagwaan ke avatar hai
 Look at his Jan Dhan Yojana
 karl marks ne garibi par bahut sari chizein likhin hai, lekin unka asli yogadan kya tha

 aisa karne waalon se main arj karata hum ki wo aisa na karen
 Objected to building the temple but the God-ordaining minister is in his cabinet and a good minister
 kam se kam congress ke adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh is tarah kaa twit to kar hi sakate hai
 By the way, Devkant Barua ji, who described Indira Gandhi as India, now has the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 agar tuutane se bachaane ke liye kiya he to congress ko ise rashtriya str par karne kii naubat na aa jaae
 In Assam, Himanta Vishwa Sharma left the party and joined the BJP
 unke peeche 9 anya congressi vidhayak bijepi main chale gaye In Uttarakhand also 9 mlas joined BJP
 agar yah samasya he to tab to congress ko apane sabhi sadasyon se halafanama karvaa lenaa chahie
 It is also possible that the MLA stays in the party and the vice-president, the activist spokesperson, should all go
 ye halafanama congress ke vidhayak apane ghar se banavaa kar nahin laae the
 When he came to the meeting, Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary gave it to him and he signed it
 motaa moti sarvasammati se faisla liya gaya
 One or two mlas left before the end of the meeting, they are not signed
 halafname main likhaa he, "vidhayak hone ke naate main party ke dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karuunga or vidhayak hone ke naate netaa vipaksh ke disha nirdesh kaa anusaran karuunga
 i will also follow the Chief Whip in the Assembly
 " In this way the affidavit has been dedicated to Congress President Sonia Gandhi
 yah apane aap main gazab kaa maamla he
 In the affidavit, the mlas have promised full allegiance to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 trinmul congress ke saansad derek o bryan ne likhaa he ki is tarah kaa halafanama apane aap main vicitra he
 Derek o'brien, defining a political party, wrote that a political party is a voluntary organization of like-minded people
 ye sabhi samaan siddhant main yakeen rakhte hai
 Is the Congress itself not confident that it is seeking an affidavit from its mlas
 derek o bryan ne iske bahaane trinmul congress kii jamkar tarif kar di
 In his article on ndtv
com, Derek has said that Mamta Banerjee is the only leader in recent history to run a separate political movement by forming her own party from the Congress
 baat congress kii karte-karte saansad sahab apane dal kaa bakhaan karne lage hai
 Like in TV debates
 pehali pankti aalochana kii hoti he, baaki kii pankti aatm prashansa kii
 From Bangla Congress, Tamil Manila Congress, Congress Tiwari to Nationalist Congress Party, Derek counted the history and scale of success
 zaahir he ginane kaa mauka congress ne hi diya
 Counting back to the last paragraph, they come back to the affidavit issue and write that some people are saying about the affidavit that it is to prevent rebellion against top leaders, where the party emphasizes the need for surgery Is going
 sthaneey str par chintaa he ki kahin ye vidhayak trinmul congress main na chale jaaen
 Adhir Chaudhary has expressed such apprehension as has happened in the past and before the elections
 bhartiya janata party ne kaha he ki congress party main log gandhi parivaar ke bandhua hai
 Some party people are expressing allegiance by writing, while some people are saying such things to show loyalty that it feels very good to write
 isi saal main march main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main unhone kaha tha ki pradhanmantri modi bharat ko bhagwaan kaa tohfa hai
 He is the Messiah of the poor
 har sector kii chunauti viraasat main mili hai or ve un chunautiyon kaa saamana karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Earlier in the year of 2014, Chairman of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations Lokesh Chandra had said - Modi ji is an incarnation of God for the poor
 unki jandhan yojana ko dekhiye
 Karl Marx has written a lot of things on poverty, but what was his real contribution
 modi ji ne garibon kii zindagi main kaaphi parivartan kiye hai
 In some aspects, he surpasses Gandhi and is an incarnation of God
 tippaniyan Prime Minister Modi made several tweets in the morning of February 2015
 kaha ki maine dekha he ki mere naam ke mandir banaae ja rahe hai
 i saw such news, i was shocked
 yah bharat kii parampara ke kilaaf he
 Our culture does not teach to build temples
 vyaktigat rup se main dukhi hua hum
 i request those who do not do this
 mandir banane se etraz kiya lekin bhagwaan bataane vaale mantri unke mantrimandal main hai or achche mantri hai
 At least Congress president and vice-president can tweet like this
 vaise indira gandhi ko bharat bataane vaale devkant barua ji ke rajya main ab bhartiya janata party kaa raaj he
 If it is done to save it from breaking, then the Congress does not have the opportunity to do it at the national level
 assam main himanta vishwa sharma party chhod bijepi main aa gaye
 9 other Congress mlas went after him in BJP uttarakhand main bhi 9 vidhayak bijepi main chale gaye
 If this is the problem, then the Congress should get all its members affidavit
 yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki vidhayak party main rah jaae or kaaryakarta pravaktaa upaadhyaksh sab chal de
 In this way the affidavit has been dedicated to Congress President Sonia Gandhi

 Iraq is burning in the fire of civil war

 With the civil war in Iraq now, the Indian economy is feared to be in shambles
 iraq se tel kii supplai agar roak di jaati he to bharat ke saamne bada sankat khadaa ho jayega
 India is the fourth largest oil importing country in the world

 In the last one week, crude oil prices have risen by $ 5 per barrel

 Terrorists are capturing Iraqi oil wells

 If America also comes down in this war, then oil refineries and oil wells will suffer a lot

 Both the low supply of oil and the drastically increasing prices of oil will double the economy of India
 tel kii keemton ke badhane kaa asar duusare utpaadon par bhi saaf badhegaa
 If the price of crude oil increases, the cost of freight will increase in the country, and then the prices of essential commodities will increase

 All he has to do is to deal with this crisis on the domestic front

 sangh ke ek padaadhikari kehete hai, ''kalladka yediurppa ko vash main nahin rakh sakate
 His emphasis may be on Gowda as he is the leader of the coastal region and relies on the goodwill of the RSS to get elected
 lekin gauda ke khilaaf bhi maamle hone kii vajah se unhen bhi baahar hi samajhie

 agar aap yah sochati hai ki aap apane purush saathi kii har baat jaanati hai, to aap galat hai
 They may even pretend that they tell you everything, but believe it, it is not so
 aapke saathi ke man main kai aisi baaten bhi hai, jo ve aapako kabhi nahin bataaenge
 Some such truths, which they will not dare to open even before forgetting you
 yakeenan ab aapke man main utsukata ne janm le hi liya hoga
 So know which are the truth, which your male partner will never want to share with you
 to mohatarama sabase pehali baat jo ve aapse kabhi nahin baantenge, wo he bistar ke dauraan agar ve kisi bhi tarah aapako rijhaate hai yaa aapako manaane ke liye minnaten karte hai, to ve ise apane sahaj vyavhaar kaa hissaa hi maanenge
 You will never say that they actually have to make efforts to convince you
 itnaa hi nahin, agar aapako paaltu jaanavar rakhane kaa shauk he or aapke ghar main ek bhayankar-sa kutta he, to bhale hi aapke mahashay kaa dil us kute ko dekhakar jor-jor se dhadkane lagata ho, lekin ve is baat kii aapako bhanak tak nahin lagane denge
 Yes, one more thing, remove this idea from your mind that they like your song very much
 bhale hi ye baat unhone khud apane munh se kabuuli ho, lekin yakeen maniye purushon ko mahilaon kaa gaanaa katai pasand nahin he
 Reason- For him it would be like watching a singing show
 agar aapako unase ye shikaayat rahati he ki unhen aapaki baton main ruchi nahin hoti, to aap galat hai
 He really loves listening to you
 ve aapke vichaar or najariyon ko sunanaa chaahate hai, lekin aapaki ve baaten to aap aksar karti hai, jaise kapade, aapke dost yaa phir kuch aisa hi unhen katai pasand nahin hoga
 So if you want them to listen to you from the heart, then give yourself and your relationship a place in those things
 aapane aksar dekha hoga ki aapkaa saathi aapke pita ke bare main chuppi saadhe rahata he
 Or even speaks, very little
 to iske peeche ek hi vajah ho sakati he
 That is, they have a different opinion about your father
 jab bhi aap unase apane pita kii baaten karti hai, to ve yahi sochate hai ki aapke pita utane bhi achche nahin jitne aap sochati hai
