 If there is no shield to equalize then it becomes difficult to face political charges
 is Is equal to ke kaaran kitnon kii kursi batch jaati he
 Tell the BJP why you are doing casteist politics, then she will say that we are doing nationalist politics
 jativaadee to janata dal vaale karte hai
 Ask the Janata Dal why are you doing casteist politics, then they will say ask the BJP
 is tarah se Is equal to kii talwaar raajnneetik dalon ko bachaane kaa hi kaam karti he
 It only beats the head of the asker
 kya karenge aap jab is nishkarsh par pahunchenge ki donon hi paksh Is equal to ho gaye hai
 After this stage, political decision depends only on loyalty
 agar aap kisi party ke prati nishthavan hai to Is equal to ke kaaran aapse koi nahin poochhega ki bhai aapaki party kii sarkaar main yah sab hua aap kya mahasoos karte hai
 The answer will come that the same has happened under the Congress rule
 bijepi bhi sansad main kaam nahin chalane detii thi, congress bhi nahin chalane degi
 Done is not equal to
 Is equal to ke kaaran saarvajanik jivan main raajnneetik bahes shunya kii avasthaa main pahunch gai he
 All are the same
 sab ghotaale karte hai
 What will you do now darshak yaa janata to bahut dinon tak Is equal to avasthaa main nahin rah sakati
 She goes to another case as soon as she is equal to one
 vahaan se phir mudda dar mudda bahes karte hue Is equal to kii avasthaa praapt kar leti he
 As if a question was asked in mathematics that a monkey climbs to such a height and slips down to two feet
 bataao bandar ne kitni duuri tay kii
 The condition of every question in politics has become monkey
 bandaron kii tarah phisalkar do-teen feet neeche aa jate hai
 Soon, the leaders will tell themselves through a press conference that we have done a better scam than Vyapam too
 jaisaa madhya pradesh main hua tha
 Just like what happened in Toji, we did it while giving the license to build a bridge in our state
 samvidhan kii dhara Is equal to ke tahat hamen yah adhikaar praapt he ki ham ghotaale karen or istipha na den
 Before handing over the investigation to the CBI, delete the evidence and if the CBI investigates before then nothing happens
 Is equal to cloj ke kaaran ab ghotaalaa karnaa aasaan hua
 We are all one
 jaao tumko jo karnaa he kar lo
 The public is never one
 kaise hogi
 It has to be instigated in the name of Hindu, sometimes in the name of Muslim
 kabhi pichde ke naam par dhadkna he, to kabhi dalit ke naam par
 Therefore the facility of Is equal to is reserved only for political parties
 isliye zaruri he ki aap agar kisi dal ke samarthak hai to duusare dal kii buraaiyaan khojkar rakhiye taaki aapke dal kii buraai saamne aate hi duusare vaale kaa bataakar hisaab baraabar kar liya jaae
 Is equal to has helped supporters to stay with their party
 isse hota yah he ki koi bhi dal adarsh nahin sabit hota
 Everybody is accused of some or the other
 Is equal to ke kaaran janata kaa ek vicitra tareeke se raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa he
 This also makes the public comfortable
 uski nishtha par koi dabaav nahin padataa
 The gravity of public loyalty becomes zero due to Is equal to
 vah hawa main tairne lagati he
 As soon as Nitish Kumar mentions Vyapam, BJP leaders will refer to the paddy scam
 is tarah se zikr karte karte donon ek hi mez par ludhak jaayenge
 Is equal to will be
 aap kuch bhi boliye aapse ummid kii jaati he ki Is equal to ke saath hi bolenge
 If you greeted Eid and did not give the Rath Yatra, you are not secular
 aap chhadam secular hai
 If you want to talk about the hundred people who died of poisonous liquor in Maharashtra, then immediately in the next paragraph, you will have to talk about school children who died of poisonous food in Chhapra, Bihar
 sabaki baat karte hue aana hoga tab aap mul baat karne ke uttaradhikari maane jaayenge
 Now there is a problem
 maan lijie ki vyaapman kii baat karne ke liye aap upi, bihar ke vyapamon kii baat karte aa rahe hai, lekin isaki koi guarantee nahin ki aapse koi puch degaa ki kya aapane 2-ji par baat kii
 Just your loyalty will be doubtful and you will be excluded from the circle of Is equal to
 raajnneetik dal puri koshish karte hai ki jin par aarope laga rahe hai wo Is equal to ko praapt na kar saken yani un par aarope na laga saken
 The moral force of the accuser is high until Is equal to
 sab bhrasht hai
 All are accused
 jaanch hai to use lekar sawaal hai
 Overall, Is equal to causes the leader and his supporters to have fun
 har ghotaalaa jaldi hi burgers or milkkek kii tarah lagane lagata he
 There are a lot of Is equal to on Twitter
 ve har baat ko baraabar kar dete hai
 Just after that no one tells what to do if it is equal to between Congress and BJP
 agar bijepi or aam aadmi party ke netaaon kii digriyaan farzi nikal aae to kya jaae
 In this way, both the scams are corrected or both are wrong
 agar isi tarah se anya dalon kaa bhi aapas main Is equal to ho gaya to kya kiya jaae
 Then only the questioner should be sent to jail
 yah kehete hue ki dekhtaa nahin be, ham donon ne ghotaale kiye hai, to aarope kis par laga rahe ho
 We are the same
 agar aap congress, bijepi kii baat karenge to koi aakar kahegaa ki are aapane samaajawaadee party yaa aam aadmi party kii baat nahin kii he
 Which is all good with them
 wo bhi inhen ke jaise hai
 The comments har tarah kii bahes main Is equal to ho gaya he
 Politics is tired
 basi lagati he
 It would have been better if the public had also declared that we are no longer public
 ghotaalaa sab karte hai lekin hamen ghotaalaa karne vaali yahi party pasand he
 So, do not disturb us unduly by talking about scam or corruption
 ham kisi na kisi dal ke samarthak hai, hamen is baat se fark nahin padataa ki hamaare netaa ne ghotaale kiye hai
 We the people have to support our party in every situation
 hamen Is equal to karte rahanaa he
 Is equal to politics is the Bermuda triangle, in which all the allegations go missing
 Is equal to ganga he, jisamen nahaakar sab paapi sanyasi ho jate hai
 Is equal to the noose for those who raise questions
 agar uthaane se pehle yaa uthaate vakt yaa uthaane ke turant baad usne dusron par sawaal nahin uthaae, to wo tatasth nahin he
 The culprit is just what is not neutral
 devtaa vahi he jiskaa jis mudde par Is equal to ho gaya he
 In prime time, Rose is equal to
 tamaam vaktaa Is equal to karke chale jate hai
 i go home and stay awake
 aap tivi dekhakar thodaa mujhe gariyaa dete hai, is-us kaa dalal bataa dete hai, pement bhi nahin bhijwate or chaiyn se mere jaise kisi ko gariyaane chale jate hai
 Your only work is left to see if Is equal to this article
 nahin hua he to pakkaa dalal hoga
 Never drink a cup of tea at home of a leader in my life, i keep hearing that i am his broker
 dallali main bhi meraa Is equal to ho gaya he
 If i have brokered everyone, then it is equal to
 yah ek tarah kii hinsa he jo rose ham jaison ke saath hoti he
 We are killed in this way
 apradhi to vahi he jo Is equal to nahin hai
 Whose Is equal to is free in this country
 aapane id kii badhai di, rathyatra kii nahin di na
 i said that you are secular
 is tip kii soch hi Is equal to kii khoh se aati he jo khud ko devtaa or duusare ko paapi banaate rahete hai
 The rest is your wish
 Is equal to kii dhaal na ho to raajnneetik aaropon kaa saamana karnaa mushkil ho jaae
 Due to this Is equal to, how many chairs are left
 bijepi se kahie ki aap jativaadee raajnneeti kyon kar rahe hai, to wo kahegi ki ham to rashtravaadi raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The casteist people do the Janata Dal
 janata dal se puuchhiye ki aap jativaadee raajnneeti kyon kar rahe hai, to ve kahenge ki bijepi se puuchhiye
 In this way, the sword of Is equal to works only to save political parties
 isse sirf poochne vaale kaa sar kalam hota he
 What will you do when you come to the conclusion that both sides have become equal
 is avasthaa ke baad raajnneetik faisla sirf nishtha par ashrith ho jaataa he
 If you are loyal to a party, no one will ask you because of Is equal to, what do you feel, brother, in the government of your party
 jawaab aayega ki congress ke raaj main bhi to yahi hua he
 BJP also did not allow Parliament to function, Congress would not allow it to run
 ho gaya na Is equal to 
 The political debate in public life has reached a state of zero due to Is equal to
 sab ek jaise hai
 Everyone scams
 ab aap kya karenge
 The audience or the public cannot remain in Is equal to state for many days
 wo ek maamle par Is equal to karte hi duusare maamle par chali jaati he
 From there the issue gets the status of Is equal to, arguing issue by point
 jaise ganit main ek sawaal poocha jaataa tha ki ek bandar itani oonchai tak chadhataa he or phisalkar do feet neeche aa jaataa he
 What distance did the monkey cover? raajnneeti main har sawaal kii haalat bandar jaisi ho gai he
 Slips like monkeys come down two or three feet
 jaldi hi ab netaa press conference kar khud hi bataayenge ki hamane bhi vyaapman se bhi acha ghotaalaa kiya he
 Like it happened in Madhya Pradesh
 jaise tu ji main hua tha, thik usee tarah apane rajya main pul banane kaa license dete vakt hamane kiya he
 Under the Article Is equal to the Constitution, we have the right to scam and not resign
 sibiai ko jaanch saunpane se pehle saboot mitaa den or sibiai pehle bhi jaanch kar le to kuch na ho
 It is now easy to scam due to the Is equal to clause
 ham sab ek hai
 Go do what you want to do
 janata kabhi ek nahin hoti
 How will it be
 use kabhi hindu ke naam par bhadakna he, to kabhi musalmaan ke naam par
 Sometimes beats in the name of backward, sometimes in the name of Dalit
 isliye Is equal to kii suvidha sirf raajnneetik dalon ke liye hi arakshit he
 Therefore, it is important that if you are a supporter of any party, then find out the evils of the other party so that as soon as the evil of your party comes to the fore, the account of the other one is calculated
 Is equal to ne samarthakon ko apane dal ke saath rahane main kaaphi madad kii he
 It happens that no party proves to be ideal
 sab par koi na koi aarope laga hi hota he
 The public is being politicized in a bizarre way due to Is equal to
 isse janata bhi sahaj ho jaati he
 There is no pressure on his loyalty
 Is equal to ke kaaran janata kii nishtha kaa gurutvkarshan shunya ho jaataa he
 She floats in the air
 jaise hi nitish kumaar vyaapman kaa zikr karen, bijepi ke netaa dhan ghotaale kaa zikr kar denge
 Referring in this way, both will be rolled on the same table
 Is equal to ho jayega
 Whatever you say, you are expected to speak with Is equal to
 agar aapane id kii badhai di or rathyatra kii nahin di, to aap secular nahin hai
 You are pseudo-secular
 aapako agar maharashtra main zahreeli sharaab se marane vaale sau logon kii baat kerani he, to turant agle hi para main bihar ke chhapra main zahreele bhojan se mare schuli bacchon kii baat kerani hogi
 You have to come while talking about everything, then you will be considered the heir to the original talk
 ab isamen bhi ek samasya he
 Suppose you have been talking about Vyapam in UP, Bihar to talk about Vyapam, but there is no guarantee that someone will ask you if you spoke on 2-G
 bas aapaki nishtha sandigdh ho jaaegi or aap Is equal to ke ghere se baahar kar diye jaayenge
 Political parties try their best not to achieve Is equal to those who are accusing them, that is, they cannot accuse them
 jab tak Is equal to nahin hota he tab tak aarope lagane vaale kaa naitik bal ooncha hota he
 All are corrupt
 sab par aarope hai
 If there is an investigation, there are questions about it
 kul milakar Is equal to ke kaaran netaa or unke samarthakon kii mouj ho jaati he
 Every scam soon looks like burgers and milkcakes
 twitor par Is equal to vaale bahut hai
 They make everything equal
 bas uske baad koi nahin bataata ki agar congress, bijepi ke bich Is equal to ho gaya to kya kiya jaae
 What to know if the degrees of BJP and Aam Aadmi Party leaders come out fake
 kya is tarah se donon ghotaale sahi ho jate hai yaa donon hi galat ho jate hai
 What to do if other parties have also become equal to each other in the same way
 phir to sawaal uthaane vaale ko hi jail bhej dena chahie
 Saying that he does not see, both of us have committed scams, so who are you accusing
 ham to ek jaise hi hai
 If you talk about Congress, BJP then someone will come and say that you have not talked about Samajwadi Party or Aam Aadmi Party
 unke yahaan koun sa sab acha he
 They are also like them
 tippaniyan Is equal to in all kinds of debate
 raajnneeti thak si gai he
 Looks stale
 acha hota ki janata bhi ab ghoshit kar de ki ham ab janata nahin rahe
 Everyone does scams but we like this scam party
 isliye aap ghotaale yaa bhrashtachar kii baat kar hamen naahak pareshaan na karen
 We are supporters of some party, we do not mind that our leader has committed scams
 ham janata kaa kaam apni party kaa har haal main samarthan karnaa he
 We have to keep doing Is equal to
 Is equal to raajnneeti kaa bermuda trikon hai, jisamen jaakar saare aarope laapata ho jate hai
 Is equal to the Ganges, in which all sinners become saints by bathing
 sawaal uthaane waalon ke liye Is equal to faansee kaa fanda he
 If he did not question others before or when lifting or immediately after lifting, then he is not neutral
 apradhi sirf vahi he jo tatasth nahin he
 The deity is the one whose issue is equal to
 prime time main rose Is equal to ho jaataa he
 All the speakers go by Is equal to
 main ghar jaakar jaagta rahata hum
 You give me a little garrison by watching TV, tell the broker of this, do not even send the payment and go to comfort someone like me
 aapkaa yahi kaam bachaa he ki dekho iske lekh main Is equal to hua he yaa nahin
 If not done then you will be a sure broker
 zindagi main kisi netaa ke ghar ek cap chaay nahin pi, aaye din sunata rahata hum ki is-us kaa dalal hum
 In the brokerage too, my Is equal to
 agar maine sabhi kii dallali kar hi lee he, to Is equal to ho gaya
 This is the kind of violence that happens to us everyday
 ham isi tarah se maare jate hai
 The culprit is the one who is not equal
 jiskaa Is equal to ho gaya wo mukt he is desh main
 You greeted Eid, did not give the Rath Yatra
 maine kaha tha ki aap secular hai
 This type of thinking comes from the lair of Is equal to those who keep themselves deities and others sinners
 baaki aapaki marzi

 gujarat kaa surat ab global dowmund kaarobaar kaa hub he
 Gujarat has taken the crown from Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel, almost two decades ago
 is kaarobaar main bharat kii maharath diamond kii khadaan se nikalne vaale ro diamond kii kating or policing ke kshetra main he
 At the same time, Israel remains the largest center of diamond trading for the whole world
 china, rus, africa samet bharat se aane vaale bejod taraashe hue heere ab bhi tel aviv ke showrooms main beche jate hai
 Still, most of the diamonds are brought to Tel Aviv for cutting and polishing after they are released from the mines of Africa and Russia
 yahaan se surat ke kaarobaari diamond kii kating or policing ke kaam kaa order laate hai or kaam puraa hone ke baad izarail main sthit diamond treders duniyabar main anguthi, pendent, swiss ghadiyaan, purse ityadi main lagane ke liye chote-bade aakaaron main diamond ko bechney kaa kaam karte hai
 In the 80s, the diamond business moved from Tel Aviv to Surat, in the global diamond trade until the 1980s, Israel was called Diamond Hub
 tel aviv or aasapaas ke kuch shaharon main diamond industry kaa 80 fisadi kaarobaar hota tha jisamen diamond kating, policing se lekar cell tak shaamil tha
 Read this: How did Mahaghotala in PNB, 30 out of every 100 rupees deposited in the bank go missing? But during this decade, some diamond traders in Surat snatched this business from Israel with quick mastery over cheap labor cost and new technology
 Succeeded in persuading iron

 Surat did 60 per cent of Israel's total exports in 2001, according to Kamal Israel trade data between 2001 and 2010
 lekin surat ke kendra main aane kii kavayad ke chalate uske export main diamond kaarobaar 41 fisadi par simata or 2010 main yah ghatakar mahaj 27 fisadi ke aasapaas rah gaya
 Read this: We stayed tuned and 50 years ahead of 'new India', 'new China' according to the current figures in Israel during FY 2016-17 where exports in diamond cutting and polishing are just 1
 3 billian dollar kaa rahaa vahiin is dauraan bharat ne kul 22 billian dollar kaa export kiya
 Apart from this, where in the 1980s and 1990s, Israel's Diamond Industry used to work 25 to 35 thousand people, today only 500 to 1000 people work
 surat kii diamond industry main maujuuda samay main 4,500 companiyaan hai jahaan lagbhag 5 lakh logon ko rajgaar mila he
 Diamond trading continues; Kingdoms has become a global hub for cutting and polishing diamonds, but in the total business of diamonds, Israel still continues to dominate
 evan-johar kii kitaab mine tu mistress ke mutabik 1939 main global diamond kaarobaar main philistin main chaar diamond kating plant the jahaan 197 log kaam karte the
 Read this: The 'nationalist' boycott of Chinese firecrackers will not work
 The Jewish diamond merchants fled Belgium and Holland after the German occupation in the 1940s
 is dauraan is kshetra main 33 companiyaan ban gai or lagbhag 5000 log inamen kaam karte the
 With this strength, at present, Israel is a big player in diamond trade and even today, diamond traders of Surat get the biggest job of cutting and polishing from Israel

 kutiyaa main bulaakar rape kaa arongale din jab peedita ke mata pita chhindwara gurukul pahunche
 He was told that his daughter is possessed by ghosts

 On August 14, the victim's family reached Asaram's Jodhpur ashram
 15 agast kii shaam ko peedita ko thik karne ke bahaane se asaram ne use apni kutiyaa main bulaakar rape kiya
 After the case was lodged in Delhi, the whole family returned home, so on August 17, the girl told the whole thing to her family

 At the box office, this film also did not show anything special but Priyanka was told that she has all the characteristics of becoming a big star
 5
 The year 2004 also did not prove to be good for Priyanka
 is saal unki teen filmein 'plan', 'kismat' or 'asambhav' relies huin, or teenon hi filmein buree tarah se pity jiske baad priyanka ke kariyar par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye magar priyanka ne himmat nahin haari

 iske baad unhone ek or bada risk uthaaya or abbaas mastaan kii film 'aitraaj' main negative kaa role kiya
 Despite Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor, the most praised Priyanka Chopra after Batori and this film, people started taking Priyanka with seriousness
 8
 In 2005, Priyanka made 5 films and the first two films, 'blackmail' and 'karam', both did not stop, but once again her pairing with Akshay Kumar was the film 'waqt - The Race Against Time'
 is film main amitabh bachchan bhi ahm kirdaar main the or phir kuch filmein arjuna rampal, abhishek bachchan, akshay khanna ke saath bhi kii, jinka kuch bhi nahin hua
 Then came the year 2006 when 'krrish' with Hrithik Roshan and 'don' with Shah Rukh Khan in which Zeenat Aman played the character Priyanka and the journey started from Bollywood's big heroine
 9
 The start of 2007 proved to be extremely bad for Priyanka

 Priyanka did not disappoint and turned to the off beat films

 In 2010, 'love Impossible' with Uday Chopra, 'anjana Jaani' with Ranbir Kapoor and 'saat Khoon Maaf' line of director Vishal Bhardwaj were flopped, but whenever there were such bumps in Priyanka Chopra's career, she started worrying
 Thinked instead and changed my strategy each time
 12
 Then again with Don '2' with Shah Rukh and 'agneepath' with Hrithik, he once again hit the line with hits like 'mary Kom', 'ramlila' and 'bajirao Mastani' and he made his mark in every film
 13
 Often seen in the film industry after a long career, actresses either get married or they themselves stop working and when people felt Priyanka is at the peak of her career and what happened next? Then Priyanka was once again shocked and turned to Hollywood

 Sourav Ganguly has made a big disclosure saying that Greg Chappell wanted to remove Sachin Tendulkar from Team India
 ganguli ne ye baaten india today group ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ko bataai
 Ganguly told that he was not ready for this, only then the captaincy was taken from him
 saurav ganguli ne bataaya, ‘chapel meri captaini kii shikaayat mere peeche duusare players se meri captaini kii shikaayat karte the jiske bare main maine selectors ko bataa diya tha
 i still remember that meeting held in Mumbai today, when i had raised these same things
 mujhe captaini se hataaya gaya kyonki tab mujhe kai senior players ko team se hataane ko kaha gaya tha lekin maine iske liye saaf manaa kar diya tha
 Then i was asked to remove Sachin, Laxman, Zaheer, Harbhajan and Sehwag
 maine saaf manaa kar diya ki aap achaanak aisa nahin kar sakate
 'saurav clearly said that Sachin himself wrote about it in his book
 isliye ab is baat ke saamne aane par yah mere liye ascharyajanak nahin he
 Then after the tour of Zimbabwe i was removed from the team and now Sachin has brought these things to everyone
 to mujhe pataa he ki ye baaten kahaan se aa rahi hai
 Ganguly said, "I lost the captaincy in 2005, even then the case was the same and even before the World Cup in 2007
 mujhe dravid ke liye afsos he kyonki yah sahi nahin he ki jab aap captain hote hai to koi aapke peeth peeche aapaki captaini par sawaal uthaae
 i also know that he did the same during my captaincy
 tab usne rahul se aisa kaha tha
 This is very sad for anyone
 mujhe chapel or bhartiya cricket donon ke liye afsos he ki unhone cricket ke str ko is had tak gira diya
 Ganguly continued, 'I don't know what was going on in Chapel's mind? He came to pursue Indian cricket or to do all these unnecessary things
 mujhe is baat kaa behad afsos he ki main tab bhartiya cricket kaa hissaa tha jab peeche ye sab chal rahaa tha
 When Ganguly was asked whether what Sachin had written in his book that he wanted to control Indian cricket, Ganguly said, "I don't know if this is the Australian way of cricket
" hamaare paas jon rhite or gairi karston jaise safal videshi coach rah chuke hai, lekin main hameshaa apane desh ke coach kaa fain rahaa hum
 'then no one came in front
 kya senior players greg chapel se bhaybheet the? yah poochne par ganguli ne kaha, ‘kabhi-kabhi ek khilaadi ke rup main aap vivaad main nahin padana chaahate
 You want to stay away from it
 main samaj saktaa hum ki tab chuppi kyon sadhi gai
 He had seen what happened to me
 siries jeetne or test main centuri lagane ke baad bhi maine apni captaini khoi
 After that i could never captain India
 us samay duniya kaa best vanade player hone ke baad bhi main kabhi vanade nahin khel sakaa
 He had seen all this
 wo risk nahin lenaa chaahate the, or vivaadon se dur rahanaa swaabhaavik tha
 i do not blame them
 mujhe team ke khilaadiyon kii vajah se hataaya gaya yah main nahin maanata
 Neither Sachin nor Dravid were behind my exit

 rajasthan ke alvar main kathith gorakshakon dwaara kii gai rakabar khan kii hatya kaa maamla ab desh kii sabase badi adaalat main pahunch gaya he
 On Monday, the Supreme Court has accepted the petition, in which the Rajasthan government and officials have been accused of violating the directions of the Supreme Court in connection with the Alwar case
 supreme court main is maamle kii sunwaayee 20 agast ko hogi
 This petition has been filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of Tehsin Poonawala
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main supreme court ne linching ko lekar kai disha nirdesh jari kiye the, centre or rajya sarkaron ko nirdeshon kaa paalan karne ko kaha tha
 But despite the SC order, such incidents did not stop in the country
 kya he alvar maamla?aapako bataa den ki rajasthan ke alvar jile main mob linching main rakabar khan kii maut ke maamle main rajya police par kai gambhir aarope lage hai
 It is alleged that the police preferred to bring the recovered cows to Gaushala first instead of taking Rakbar to the hospital
 yahi nahin, police ne khud bhi rakabar kii pitayee kii
 Due to this, Rakbar was delayed for three hours to reach the hospital and he died

 The Supreme Court said in its judgment that mobocracy cannot be allowed

 It is the duty of the government to ensure that the rule of law is maintained

 No citizen can take the law into his own hands

 Parliament should make laws in this matter and governments should work according to the constitution

 The Supreme Court said that the government should give compensation to the victims of the mob
 asadha shukla paksh kii poornima ko guru poornima ke rup main puure desh main utsaah ke saath manaaya jaataa he
 There have been many learned gurus in India, but Maharishi Veda Vyas was the first scholar who explained the four Vedas of Sanatana Dharma (hinduism)
 sikh dharm keval ek ishwar or apane das guruon kii vaani ko hi jivan kaa vaastavik satya maanata he
 a popular proverb of Sikhism is the following: 'guru Govind Dow standing kak k xxrep 9 a pada, Balihariiguru you told Govindio'
 
 What is believed is that Adi Guru Ved Vyas was born on Ashada Purnima
 unke sammaan main hi asadha maas kii poornima ko guru poornima ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 But one should see the deeper meaning because the full moon that falls in the month of Ashadh is not known
 akaash main badal ghire ho sakate hai or bahut sambhav he ki chandramaa ke darshan tak na ho paaen
 What full moon without moon! Can you ever imagine? Without the moon's flickering rays, what would the full moon mean? agar kisi poornima kaa zikr hota he to vah sharad poornima kaa hota he to phir sharad kii poornima ko kyon na shreshth mana jaae kyonki us din chandramaa kii purnataa man moh leti he
 Crocodile is more than Aashad Purnima because it has special significance
 asadha kii poornima hi kyon he guru poornimaasadha kii poornima ko chunane ke peeche gaharaa arth he
 It means that the Guru is like a full moon moon, which is full of light and the disciple is like the clouds of Aashaadh
 asadha main chandramaa badalon se ghira rahata he jaise badal rupi shishyon se guru ghire hon
 All kinds of disciples can be, have come with the darkness of births
 ve andhere badal kii tarah hi hai
 In that too the Guru can shine like the moon, in that dark surrounded environment can also awaken light, only then is the superiority of the Guru post
 isliye asadha kii poornima kaa mahatv he! isamen guru kii taraf bhi ishaara he or shishy kii taraf bhi
 This is an indication that where both meet, there is some meaning
 guru purnima parv kaa mahatvajivan menguru or shikshak ke mahatvako aane vaali peedi ko bataane ke liye yah parv adarsh he
 Vyasa Purnima or Guru Purnima should not be celebrated on the basis of superstition but with reverence
 guru kaa aashirwad sabake liye kalyankari va gyanavarddhak hota he, isliye is din guru pujan ke uparaant guru kaa aashirwad praapt karnaa chahie
 The importance of this festival in Sikhism is more because the ten gurus have been very important in Sikh history

 In such a situation, politics may intensify on this issue during the upcoming assembly elections

 Now once again this issue is hot
 congress or ensipi ne is smarak nirmaan ke liye nivida prakriya main kul 1300 karod rupee ke ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The NCP made this allegation citing the letter of two officials of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Project Division
 ensipi kaa aarope he ki senior acounts officer sanjeev kumaar singh ne ek aphis note main 2018 main aarope lagaaya tha ki contract dene main aniyamitata barti gai he or sivisi ke guidelines kaa ulanghan hua he
 Singh said in his letter that the terms of the original tender were changed, which was in violation of the CVC guidelines
 isamen kaha gaya he ki agar nunatam boli lagane vaale kii dar vyavhaarik nahin thi to adhik pratispardhi daron ke liye nivida mangaaye ja sakate the
 The allegation states that in February 2019, the second divisional accounts officer Vikas Kumar wrote a letter to the Principal Accountant General, demanding an audit of the project's tender
 isamen kumaar ne ucch adhikariyon dwaara dabaav kii ore bhi ishaara kiya tha
 Accusing the BJP, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said, "they have come to power by seeking votes in the name of Shivaji Maharaj and are doing corruption in the project of Shivaji memorial itself
" ham is puure maamle main nyaayik jaanch kii maang karte hai
 The BJP rejected the charge and said that these allegations are baseless
 ye nahin chaahate ki yah project kabhi puraa ho
 Maharashtra PWD Minister Chandrakant Patil said, "congress and NCP have no fundamental right to speak on them
 donon partiyaan satta main rahete hue ise puraa nahin kar sake or jab yah puraa ho rahaa he to ye is par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that the memorial of the founder of the Maratha Empire, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, is being built on the Mumbai coast in the Arabian Sea

 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa asked her cadres to give them 40 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as a gift, in view of their aspiration to play an important role in national politics
 tamilnadu main loksabhaa kii 39 siten hai jabaki ek seat pados ke kendrashasit kshetra puducheri kii he
 On February 24, Jayalalithaa, who is turning 64, urged the party workers not to hold any grand event on her birthday, that they should gift them all 40 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and work from now on
 Start jayalalita ne rashtriya raajnneeti main badi bhoomika nibhaane kii apni ichha kaa izhaar pehali baar nahin kiya he
 Earlier in December, while addressing party workers, he said that work would have to be done to bring the party to such a position that it can choose the Prime Minister
 jayalalita ne pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav congress yaa bhaajapa kisi se bhi gathjod kiye bina akele hi ladaa tha or unhen maatr 9 siten mili thim lekin gat varsh april main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main satta virdohi lahar ke chalate unhone dramuk ko karaari shikast di or rajya main teesri baar mukhyamantri baniin
 Now he is eyeing the Lok Sabha elections
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ne qamar kas lee he
 The party is going to organize Nukkad public meetings at 90 places in the capital on Monday
 vivadagrast'ramjaado banaam 
 
 jaado' tippanee ko lekar vipaksh ke nishane pararhi kendriya mantri sadhviniranjan jyotibhi in sabhaaon ko sambodhit karengi
 These BJP meetings will be held in Trilokpuri and New Ashok Nagar areas of East Delhi
 sadhvi ke alaava kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad, menka gandhi, najma hepatulla, satyanarayan jenita or thavar chand gahalot bhi sabhaaon ko sambodhit karne vaale sheersh netaaon main shaamil hai
 In a statement issued by Delhi BJP, it said that the party will organize 350 street corner meetings in all corners of Delhi
 mantriyon ke alaava, abhinetri se netaa bani kiran kher or paresh rawal bhi in sabhaaon main bhaag lenge
 According to party sources, the controversy over the statement of Sadhvivi Niranjan Jyoti is now a matter of old days
 sadhvi logon ke bich jaaengi or narendra modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan karengi
 State Minister for Food Processing, Miraniranjan Jyoti gave a controversial statement while addressing an election meeting on 30 November
 iske baad sansad ke donon sadanon main kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 Sadhvi apologized for her statement after the commotion
 lekin vipakshi partiyaan sadhvi ke istife ko lekar apni maang par adi rahi
 After the Prime Minister's intervention in both the Houses, the opposition relaxed the demand, but the proceedings of Parliament could not go on smoothly for a whole week
 jharkhand main raashtrapati shashan kii avadhi kareeb ek pakhwaade main samaapt ho jaaegi or aise main congress rajya main vaikalpik sarkaar banane ke liye jharkhand mukti morcha ke saath gathbandhan banane kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 Sources said that as per the consensus so far, the Congress will accept Hemant Soren, the son of JMM president Shibu Soren, as the chief minister, while the JMM will have to give consent to the Congress candidates in nine to ten seats in the next Lok Sabha elections
 sutron ne kaha ki congress rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar main shaamil hogi
 However, there are some contrary opinions in the party as well
 hemanth or varisht jhamumo netaa champai sorain mangalvaar ko ranchi se nai dilli pahunche or ve congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi, varisht party netaa e ke antni tathaa ahamed patel se mulaakaat karenge
 Antony is also the head of a subgroup formed on the subject of coalition for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 congress shuruyaat main adhiktar party vidhayakon ke dabaav ke baavjood jharkhand main sarkaar banane ko lekar zyada utsuk nahin thi
 a senior Congress leader said, 'but with the Lok Sabha elections nearing, the party thought of including another party in the UPA
 jhamumo ke paas rajya main majboot aadhaar he jisase inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand, the Congress currently has one, which is represented by Subodh Kant Sahay
 jhamumo ke do loksabhaa sadsy hai
 He contested the last Lok Sabha election alone
 saal 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main jab congress or jhamumo ne gathbandhan main chunaav ladaa tha to congress ko chah siten milin thim or jhamumo ke khate main chaar seat ain thim
 The RJD and CPI also had an alliance and captured two and one seats respectively
 is tarah upie ke khate main tab 12 siten ain thim
 Congress General Secretary Shakeel Ahmed, BK Hariprasad, in-charge of party affairs of the state, Jharkhand Pradesh Congress President Sukhdev Bhagat and Congress Legislature Party leader RP Singh met JMM President Shibu Soren and his son Hemant on Tuesday to form the government in the state Negotiated the possibility
 sutron ke mutabik agar argedy is gathbandhan main shaamil ho jaataa he to loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye congress ke nau se das siton ke sambhavit hisse main se use do siten di ja sakati hai
 Sources in both Congress and JMM have talked about running the government in a positive manner while Congress spokesperson Mim Afzal said on such questions that information will be given only if a decision is taken
 jharkhand main 8 janvari ko bijepi sarkaar girane ke baad raashtrapati shashan lagaaya gaya tha
 Shibu Soren's party, which has been supporting UPA 2 from outside, appears keen to form an alternative government in the state, allying with the Congress after breaking ties with the BJP
 rajya main raashtrapati shashan 18 july ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 Even before this, Jharkhand has been under President's rule in 2009 and 2010

 Even after the passport is canceled, Nirav Modi has traveled to many countries by dodging, which is a cause of concern for Indian security agencies
 videsh mantralay baar-baar kah rahaa he ki neerav modi kaa passport radd he, lekin phir neerav yatraaen kar rahaa he
 The biggest question is, how can this be possible, let's try to understand
 1
 If a person's passport is canceled, then this information is given by the Immigration Authority in all countries
 ye jaankaree bhartiya ucchayog, bhartiya mishan or anya adhikari dete hai
 2
 is maamle main 24 farvari ko videsh mantralay ne neerav modi kaa passport radd kiya tha
 But the Interpol report says that Nirav Modi is still using passports
 3
 On June 5, Interpol wrote a letter to Indian agencies claiming that Nirav was traveling on an Indian passport from March 15 to the first week of May
 31 march ko neerav modi euke se paris bhi bhartiya passport par hi gaya tha
 4
 sawaal he ki akhirpassporterdd hone ke baad bhi neerav modi travel kaise kar rahaa he
 When the CBI and ED are asked about this, their answer is that only the Ministry of External Affairs can tell anything about it
 videsh mantralay is maamle ko lekar police exiaar karvaa saktaa he
 5
 interpol ke paas abhi tak neerav modi ke bare main jo bhi jaankaree he vah ek-duusare deshon kii agenciyon ke bich rishton ke kaaran mil rahi he
 But as Nirav Modi's passport is still active, no one is allowed to arrest or interrogate him
 6
 If a red corner notice is issued against Nirav Modi, then Interpol can ask its partner countries to give information about Nirav Modi
 jaise hi jaankaree milti he to use giraftaar / hiraasat / poochtacha kii ja sakati he
 7
 jo bhi desh use giraftaar karata he to use turant bharat ko isaki jaankaree deni hogi
 But how and how soon that India will come will be decided on the relationship between India and the country where Nirav Modi will be caught
 gauratlab he ki kareeb 13 hajaar karod rupee ke pienbi ghotaale ke maamle main sibiai ne neerav modi or kai anya ke khilaaf chargeshit daakhil kii he
 After this, the CBI has requested Interpol to issue redcorner notice
 haalanki abhi interpol ne red corner notice ko notiphoi nahin kiya he
 Therefore, Nirav Modi is able to travel easily
 bataa den ki ferjilator of andertekingske jariye neerav modi ne punjab neshnal bank ko 13400 karod rupee se zyada kii rakam kaa chuunaa lagaaya he
 Apart from Nirav, Mehul Choksi also has an important role in this scam
 sibiai ne 14 may ko mumbai ke sibiai court main pehali chargeshit daakhil kii
 In the charge sheet filed by the CBI, 24 people were charged in this scam of Rs 13,400 crore, besides the main accused Nirav Modi, including Allahabad Bank CEO Usha Ananthasubramanian

 Protest of Ghuggi in foreign countries also created a ruckus on this viral speech of Gurpreet Ghuggi
 gurprit ghuggi philhal america main hai or vahaan par bhi unhen sikh sanghathanon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party defended Gurpreet Ghuggi and said that his talk is being misinterpreted and there are very few people who are opposing Ghuggi and some people are needlessly making this point under an agenda
 Are engaged ghuggi par ho sakati he karrwisikh sanghathan is baat se kaaphi naaraaz hai or jald hi gurprit ghuggi ke khilaaf police or court main shikaayat karne kaa man bana rahe hai

 5 feet kii golai vaala yah shivlinga niklaa he
 The entire temple complex collapsed in the twelfth century earthquake and subsequent flooding of the Chitrotopala Mahanadi
 mandir ke khambhe nadi ke kinare chale gaye
 Hundreds of Shivling have been found in Sirpur in excavations for many years
 inamen se gandheshwar kii tarah yah shivlinga bhi saabut niklaa he

 The period was calculated on the basis of coins, statues, copper plates, utensils, inscriptions found in the excavation
 site par khudaai kii gaharaai jaise-jaise badhati he, pracheen kaal ke or saboot milte jate hai
 Based on the depth at which Shivling was found in the ground, it has been considered as two thousand years old
 baharhaal yahaan mil rahe shivlinga puraatatv ke jaankaron ke liye ab shodh kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he

 If we have to seek cooperation from the government, then some of its things have to be accepted

 Before the budget speech of Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu, the biggest question was in people's minds, how many new trains will be announced
 kis rajya ko zyaada or kise kam trainen milengi
 Actually, this scale of looking at the railway budget was made for the last several years
 har baar bajet ke baad vipaksh ke netaa agar sarkaar par kisi baat ko lekar sabase zyaada nishaanaa sadhate to wo ki trainen dene main nyaay nahin kiya gaya
 The regional parties have increased in politics and they used to show resentment for not getting trains to their states, but this time the government snatched this issue from the opposition
 vahiin tikaton kii keemat alag na badi, na ghati, to ye mudda bhi nahin uthaa
 Suresh Prabhu emphasizes the change in the budget, but this is not the first railway budget, with emphasis on change
 saafe-safaai ke daawey har rail bajet main hote hai
 i travel in the railways and i am still waiting for these claims to become reality
 janvari maheene main patna se dilli aa rahaa tha
 The train was late for about eight hours
 bathroom kaa bura haal tha
 a number has been installed for cleanliness, but there is no benefit to call on it
 trainen or zyaadaatar railway stesan aaj bhi gande hai, or ise kaagazon par nahin, zamin par saafe karne kii zarurat hai
 If Suresh Prabhu could do it, it would be the biggest success
 vahiin, tikaton kaa reserveshan ab chaar maheene pehle hoga, iske peeche tark diya ja rahaa he ki dallalon par lagaam lagegi
 Right now this limit is two months and three months before that
 teen maheene se do maheene karne ke peeche tark diya gaya tha ki dallalon par lagaam lagegi, kya lagaam lagi? darasal reserveshan ke maheene kam yaa zyaada karne se dallalon par lagaam nahin lagegi
 For this the system has to be changed
 ab suresh prabhu ne jis tarah bajet ko badla he usase ummid kerani chahie ki railway bhi badalegaa
 However VVS Laxman admits that he was surprised when Suresh Raina was dropped from the ODI team
 vahiin kapil kehete hai, "kabhi-kabhi khilaadiyon ko jatke bhi zaruri hote hai, raina vaapasi ke liye jor lagaayenge
 " bharat main natya kala ke sabase pratishthit centre rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) main pravesh itnaa dushwaar hota he ki har saal kai pradeshon ke ek bhi chaatr ko daakhila nahin mil paata
 Leave aside the matter of one district
 lekin is saal bihar ke begusarai jile ke teen kalakaaron ko isamen kamyaabi mili he
 Two of them — Khushboo Kumari and Chandan Kumar — belong to the group The Fact, 42-year-old Praveen Kumar Gunjan, a prominent color worker in the city
 tisare alok ne bhi unke saath rangakarm kiya he
 But Pachisek has been associated with the stage for years and Gunjan, an NSD educated himself, considers it a more natural process than an achievement
 darasal, gunjan oonche khwaabon kii bajaae yatharth kii duniya main jite rahe hai
 At the time of entering NSD, he had clearly told the interview board that "I am laughable so i will not become an actor
" par abhinay karvaa saktaa hum kyonki isaki samaj he mujhe
 He gave proof of this in the Samjhauta drama
 muktibodh kii isi sheershak kii kahani par taiyaar ekal naatak main maanavendra treepathi ne kamaal kaa abhinay kiya
 He received the Best Director Award in 2012 for "meta", considered an Oscar for Indian theater
 2009 main enesdy se nikalne ke baad gunjan mumbai, dilli yaa patna main deraa daalane kii bajaae sidhe begusarai aa gaye
 Now the question was whether a team and facilities for staging
 unhone kasbe or aasapaas ke gaanvon ke bisek yuvaaon ko jodakar da fact group banaaya (paas ke dumri gaanv kii khushboo kii aawaaj main chhipi pratibha unhone usee dauraan pahachaani)
 Apart from mobilizing resources, in order to connect directly with the people of the city, he established a bond with all ideologues, Left, Congress, RSS, JD (U), RJD
 usee kaa nateeja he ki 21 disambar se nagar ke tounhall main hone ja rahe da fact ke saatven salanaa jalse rang-e-maahaul ke liye jaise puraa shahar khadaa ho gaya
 Rajinikanth's 2 in five theaters
 0, bhojpuri lagal nathunia ke dhakka or kedarnath jaisi filmein chal rahe hone ke baavjood sadak chalate log gunjan ko rokkar puch rahe hai, "i bataaie, abaki koun-koun naatak bulaae hai?'' unheen ke utsav main begusarai ke log kulbhushan kharbanda or ashish vidhyaarthee sareekhe nami abhinaytaon kaa jeevant abhinay dekh chuke hai
 Noted actress Seema Biswas is coming up with a new drama for the second time next week
 par utsav kii shuruyaat to gunjan nirdeshit ek akeli aurat se hi hogi, jisamen shahar ke log ek baar phir theth gaanv se nikali khushboo kii abhinay pratibha ke gavaah banenge

 New school buildings have been built around these buildings
 shikshavidon kaa maananaa he ki skulon main bacchon ke ghar or samudayik parivesh se jeevant sambandh sthapit hone vaala maahaul muhaiyaa kiya janaa chahie
 For this the ancient buildings of schools have been said to be effective

 The government has set up centralized data centers in Delhi and Bengaluru to legally intercept conversations and messages over phone and internet
 iske saath hi doorsanchaar companiyon ke thikaanon par vishesh rup se sarwar lagaae gaye hai
 In June 2011, the government commissioned the Central Monitoring System (CMS) to legally capture voice, data, SMS and internet services
 iske liye centre ne 400 karod rupee aavantit kiye hai
 Sources said the installation of the equipment at the central data center in Delhi and the disaster recovery site in Bangalore has been completed under the project and is currently undergoing trials

 - input language haryana ke pachankula, rohtak or gurugram se lekar punjab ke kai shaharon tak, rajasthan ke barmer se lekar uttar pradesh or phir bharat-nepal border tak, haryana police jagah jagah kii khaak chaan rahi he
 He is desperately looking for Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh's right hand and Honeypreet Insan, the mastermind of the Panchkula violence
 lekin haniprit he ki lagaataar haryana police ko chakma detii aa rahi he
 Getting help from Haryana Police from other states has also not worked yet
 sutron ke mutabik haryana pulicehanipritki giraftaar ke liye ro or ibi jaisi kendriya khufia agenciyon se lekar nepal police tak sampark saadh chuki he, lekin haniprit kaa ab tak kuch pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa
 Where is Honeypreet? Had Honeypreet already suspected that the police would try to arrest Gurmeet as soon as he goes to jail
 kya isi vajah se haniprit ne underground hone ke le pehle se hi phulpruf taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 Haryana Police DGP BS Sandhu claims that all efforts are being made to arrest Honeypreet and Dera spokesperson Adi Insan
 deraa ke pravaktaa rah chuke aditya insaan par bhi haniprit kii tarah deshadroh kaa aarope he
 The DGP has expressed hope that both will soon be under police custody
 jahaan se bhi kuch bhanak milti he, police timen us sthaan ko gher kar talaashi leti hai
 Meanwhile, two former followers of the dera have claimed that Gurmeet Ram Rahim had foreseen what bad conditions might happen for him
 ye daawa karne vaale hai gurmeet ke rishtedaar bhupendra singh or kabhi gurmeet ke bahut kareebi maane jane vaale purv sevada gurdas singh
 According to both of them, Gurmeet had already realized everything and bought a lot of land abroad
 inamen kai saude haniprit ke naam par kiye gaye the
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim had made full arrangements to hide himself and Honeypreet by taking roots in Dubai, Canada, USA and Singapore
 kehane ko videsh main jameen deraa sachcha sauda ke naam charchaa ghar banane ke liye kharidi jaati thi
 According to Bhupendra Singh, if Honeypreet is still in the country, then it is very likely that the staunch followers of the camp will be helping her hide
 aisi sthiti main haniprit haryana, punjab, uttar pradesh yaa rajasthan main kahin bhi chuphi ho sakati he
 It is also likely that she is constantly changing her hideout to avoid the police
 yahi vajah he ki wo police ke hathe nahin chadh paa rahi
 Ex-serviceman Gurdas Singh, quoting a number of dera's close quarters, claimed that Honeypreet reached the Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa after Gurmeet Ram Rahim was imprisoned in Rohtak
 vahaan usne apane saamne ahm sabooton ko thikaane lagaaya
 According to Gurdas Singh, Honeypreet broke several CCTV cameras in front of her and deleted her footage
 yahi nahin hriniprit ne dere main rakhe apaar kaale dhan ko bhi idhar-udhar rakhwa kar manage karaayaa
 She then went underground by explaining the strategy of the forward to the confidants of the managing committee of the camp
 gurdas singh ke mutabik police ko agar koi haniprit ke sahi thikaane tak pahunchaa saktaa he to wo ek shaks he
 And that is Vipassana Insan, the chairperson of the Dera Managing Committee
 gurdas singh kaa kahana he ki agarpulisvipasana par focus kare to use kamyaabi mil sakati he
 Whatever it is, Honeypreet currently remains a big puzzle for Haryana Police and the country's intelligence agencies
 haryana police par dabaav he ki gurmeet ke saare rahasyon se pardaa uthaane ke liye jald se jald haniprit ko giraftaar kare
 Only after this happens can the Panchkula violence and conspiracy to manage the crowd be exposed
 supreme court ne aaj aarushi−hemraj hatyakand maamle main noopur talwaar ko somvaar tak sarender karne kaa aadesh diya he
 Nupur will have to surrender to the lower court
 tippaniyan Nupur Talwar filed an application to stay the non-bailable warrant issued by the lower court of Ghaziabad
 supreme court ne aisa karne se inkaar kar diya or kaha ki jab noopur jamaanat ke liye arji daayar karengi to us par teji se vichaar kiya jayega
 This means that Nupur may have to spend a day or two in jail until his bail is decided
 gauratlab he ki noopur aarushi-hemraj hatyakand main aaropee hai or vah is sunwaayee ke dauraan adaalat main maujuud thim
 His lawyers gave several arguments to save him from the trouble of going to jail, but the court has pronounced the verdict by hardening his stand
 noopur talwaar ne gajiabad kii nichali adaalat dwaara jari gaiyr-jamaanti warrant par roak lagane kii arji daayar kii thi
 The Supreme Court refused to do so and said that when Nupur filed an application for bail, it would be considered expeditiously
 iskaa matlab he ki noopur ko ek-do din jail main bitaane pad sakate hai, jab tak unki jamaanat par faisla nahin ho jaae
 Significantly, Nupur is an accused in the aarushi-hemraj murder case and she was present in the court during this hearing
 unke vakeelon ne unhen jail jane kii pareshaani se bachaane ke liye kai daleelein deen lekin court ne apana rukh sakht karte hue faisla suna diya he

 Meghna says that i was not told about this
 unhone kaha, yahaan sara sansar jarurat ke niyam par chalata he
 We should understand, as long as your need is your value

 It should have been investigated
 gaur ho ki 16 june ko, id juluus ke dauraan 'azaadi' ke naare kii afvaahen failaai gayi jiske baad kishtwar ke puri ilaake main tanaavpurn sthiti utpann ho gai
 However, the police showed speed and dismissed the claims and increased security in the entire area
 saal 2013 main bhi soshal media par id ke dauraan pakistan sambandhi naaron kii afvaahen failaai gayi thim, jiske baad puure ilaake main hinsa fail gai thi
 Three people were killed in this, while many people were injured
 haryana ke mahendragarh main 24 schuli bacchon ko jaise hi deepiti kaa tikaa lagaaya gaya, unki tabiyat bigadane lagi
 Apparently, there is a possibility of some big flaw and negligence in giving the vaccine, but instead of investigation, the school and hospital administration was seen in the cover of the case
 gaanv rasulpur ke 24 bacchon kii tabiyat ek saath bigadane se hadakamp much gaya
 The DPT was injected by the Health Department to the younger children of the Primary School and immediately after the injection, a child fainted, then an innocent complained of headache, vomiting and fever
 maamla gambhir tha or ghere main swasthya vibhaag se lekar skool prashasan tha, lihaaja puure maamle par pardaa daalane kii koshish bhi shuru ho gai
 one bed of the hospital 
 aspataal ke doctor bhi kuch bataane ko raji nahin the
 There was an effort to avoid media questions
 philhal sabhi bachche khatre se baahar bataae ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises whether innocent injections of DPT were not given to the innocent
 It is very important to investigate this question
 champions trophy ke final mukaable main pakistan ke haathon bharat ko karaari shikast jhelni padi thi
 Cricket fans across the country were saddened by India's defeat
 lekin is bich kashmir se pakistan kii jeet par pataakhe phode jane kii khabar ai thi
 The government has today denied this news
 sansad main kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir jammu-kashmir sarkaar kii report kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pichley saal ICC champions trophy ke pakistan ke khilaaf bhartiya team kii haar ke baad kashmir main pataakhe phode jane jaisi koi ghatana nahin hui
 Ahir gave this information in written reply to Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant's question in Lok Sabha
 sadsy ne sawaal kiya tha ki kya ICC champions trophy ke final main bharat kii haar kaa jashn jammu-kashmir mempataakhe chhodkar manayagaya?bataa den ki pichley saal 18 june ko khele gaye champions trophy ke final main bharat 180 ran se haar gaya tha
 After this defeat, Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq had claimed in a tweet that firecrackers were being burnt all over the valley and celebrations in Kashmir before Eid
 unhone jeet ke liye pakistan cricket team ko badhai bhi di thi
 Fireworks all around, feels like an early Eid here
 Better team took the day
 Congratulations team # Pakistan— Mirwaiz Umar Farooq (@mirwaizkashmir) June 18, 2017 Following this same tweet by Mir, media reports of India's defeat in the valley bursting firecrackers and throwing firecrackers inside the CRPF camp in Srinagar
 lekin sarkaar ne aaj loksabhaa main iskaa khandan kiya he

 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi today said that there is no threat to his government and he will complete his term
 mukhyamantri awaas par yojit ‘janata ke darbar main mukhyamantri’ kaarykram ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main rajyasabha upachunaav main jadyu ummidavaaron kaa party ke baagi vidhayakon dwaara kiye ja rahe virodh ke bare main puche jane par maanjhi ne kaha ki unki sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he or yah agle saal november tak apana kaarykaal puraa karegi
 Manjhi said that at present the issue is not anti-congress but anti-bjp
 isliye sabhi dalon ko ek manch par aakar bhaajapa ke khilaaf sangharsh karnaa chahie
 He supported Lalu Prasad, the RJD supremo of former Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, to support the JDU candidates in the upcoming by-elections for the two Rajya Sabha seats in Bihar on June 19, with the Congress and the CPI destabilizing the Bihar government and holding elections in the state
 Justified the appeal to take it as a 'common cause' to thwart the 'game plan'
 yah puche jane par ki rajd ke ‘jangal raaj’ ke khilaaf sangharsh kar satta main ai jadyu kaa uske saath haath milaanaa kya sahi he, jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha ki yah ab yah purana mudda ho gaya he
 He said that in ancient times people did not wear clothes, but after development, they started wearing clothes
 isi prakaar ‘jangal raaj’ ek puraani baat he
 The IAS officer has been sent to jail on charges of taking bribe in his first posting
 yah ghatana bihar ke kaimur zile kii he jahaan 2013 batch ke bhartiya prashasnic seva ke adhikari doctor jitendra gupta ko kuch trek waalon se ghoose lene ke aarope main rajya nigaraanee vibhaag ne giraftaar kiya or buudhvaar shaam nigaraanee adaalat ne unhen 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main jail bhej diya
 Jitendra Gupta, who was jailed in his first posting, was working at the SDM post in Kaimur district, Bihar
 jitendra gupta ke saath unke driver or homeguard ke ek jawan ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya he or un teenon par trek waalon se avaidh vasuuli karne kaa aarope he
 Actually, in this incident, the surveillance department came when some truck owners informed that 4 trucks were being taken from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand like Punjab iron and on 4th of this month, accused Jitendra Gupta caught an overloaded truck and drove the truck In lieu of leaving, he demanded one lakh 45 thousand and after negotiation, 80 thousand was negotiated
 lekin trek maalikon ne is bich nigaraanee vibhaag ko suchit kar diya or 12 july ko esadm ko driver se paise lete rangen haathon pakadaa gaya
 Later, several truck documents were also found in the raids on Gupta's house
 tippaniyan At the same time, the state's IAS Association says that this action is wrong and if the arrest of the officer on the driver's statement started, then in the coming days many officers of the country can go to jail
 is sambandh main rajya iees association kaa ek pratinidhimandal nigaraanee vibhaag ke aaladhikariyon se bhi mila
 Some people say that the possibility that Gupta's action caused a furore in the truck and entry mafia cannot be ruled out and he arrested Gupta through the driver

 darasal is ghatana main nigaraanee vibhaag us samay aayaa jab kuch trek maalikon ne soochna di kii jharkhand ke jamshedpur se 4 trek punjab lohe ke samaan lekar ja rahe the or is maheene kii 4 tarikh ko aaropee jitendra gupta ne ek overloded trek ko pakadaa or trek ko chhodane ke badale ek lakh 45 hazaar kii maang kii or baad main molbhav ke baad 80 hazaar main baat bani
 But the truck owners, meanwhile, informed the monitoring department and on July 12, SDM was caught red-handed taking money from the driver
 baad main gupta ke ghar par chhapemari main kai trek ke kaagazaat bhi mili
 The comments vahiin, rajya kii iees association kaa kahana hai ki ye karrwai galat he or driver ke bayaan par adhikari kii giraftaari agar hone lagi to aane vaale dinon main desh ke kai adhikari jail ja sakate hai
 In this regard, a delegation of the State IAS Association also met the top officials of the Monitoring Department
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki gupta kii karrwai se trek or entry maffia main khalabali machi ho or unhone driver ke madhyam se gupta kii giraftaari kar di

 elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne shuukravaar ko aarushi talwaar ke mata-pita kii ore se daayar rit yachika par sunwaayee shuru kii
 In the petition, Aarushi's parents have challenged the summons issued to her by a special court in Ghaziabad
 talwaar danpati ko apni beti aarushi or gharelu kaamkaaj main haath bantane vaale hemraj kii hatya ke aarope main saman jari kiya gaya he
 He has challenged the summons issued by the special CBI court on the ground that the summons was issued in the 'closure report' filed by the investigating agency despite his not being named as the accused
 talwaar danpati ke vakil gopal chaturvedi ne adaalat main jirah ke dauraan kaha ki sibiai kii ore se daayar ‘closer report’ ke maamle main gajiabad kii vishesh adaalat ke paas teen vikalp the- pehla, report ko sweekaar kar le, doosraa, ise nirast kar diya jaae yaa teesraa, phir se jaanch karne kaa aadesh de
 However, Chaturvedi claimed that the court did not consider any of the above three options and wrongly decided to initiate proceedings against the Talwar couple
 jab sibiai ke vakil najarul islam jaafaree jirah ke liye khadey hue to bachaav paksh ke vakil ne yah kehete hue iskaa jabardast virodh kiya ki is tarah kii yachika main virodh karne kaa adhikaar jaanch agency ke paas nahin he
 Chaturvedi made a number of arguments in favor of his argument and requested the court that proceedings be dismissed in a special CBI court
 gauratlab he ki vishesh adaalat ne talwaar danpati se kaha he ki vah 27 farvari ko adaalat main sasharir hajir hon

 Militants attacked a military camp in Kupwara district of North Kashmir, in which three military personnel, including a captain, were martyred and five soldiers were injured
 jaish-e-mohammad ke do sandigdh aatanki javaabi karrwai main maare gaye
 a defense spokesperson said that the militants attacked the military camp at Panjgaon in Chowkibal of Kupwara at four o'clock this morning
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki hamale main ek adhikari samet teen sanyakarmi shahid ho gaye
 The army killed two terrorists
 shahid adhikari kii pahchaan captain aayush ke taur par hui he, lekin do sainikon ke naam tatkaal pataa nahin chal paae hai
 Officials said five other soldiers were also injured in the attack
 ghayal sainikon ko ilaaj ke liye vaayu maarg se sena ke 92 base aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Official sources said that a search operation is being carried out to find out whether any other terrorist had taken advantage of the darkness and entered the camp
 shivi main maujuud sanyakarmi is ilaake main sadak kholane ke kaam se jude hai
 The comments (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) ek raksha pravaktaa ne kaha ki aatankiyon ne aaj subah chaar baje kupwada ke chaukeebal sthit panjagaanv main sainya shivi par hamalaa bol diya
 The spokesman said that three military personnel, including an officer, were killed in the attack
 sena ne do aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 The martyr officer has been identified as Captain Ayush, but the names of the two soldiers are not immediately known
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki hamale main paanch anya sainik bhi ghayal hue hai
 The injured soldiers were airlifted to the Army 92 Base Hospital for treatment
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki yah pataa lagane ke liye khoj abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he ki andhere kaa phayda uthaakar koi anya aatanki shivi main to nahin ghus gaya
 The military personnel present in the camp are involved in the road opening work in this area

 ) The openness about Hindi that Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed in his speech at the three-day 10th World Hindi Conference at Lal Parade Ground, Bhopal, seemed completely different from the traditional opinion of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and even the BJP
 bijepi kii puraani soch or modi ke nae tareeke kaa fark videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or modi ke bhaashanon main istemaal hindi bhashaa ke prayog main saaf dikhaai diya
 Sushma Swaraj's entire speech was in Sanskritist Hindi, while Modi was speaking colloquially in his own style
 kabhi isi bhashaa ko mahatma gandhi or pandit nehru ne hindustani naam diya tha
 Modi emphasized in his speech that Hindi should not be averse in incorporating the words of other languages into itself
 unhone kaha ki bhashaa hawa ke us jhonke kii tarah he, jo apane saath sthaan or parivesh ko bhi aage le jaati he
 Language will have to grow from generation to generation and meet the demands of new times
 duusari ore sangh kii vichaardhaara or pathan-pathan kii style main hameshaa se sanskritnishtha bhashaa kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 Modi took his differences to such a level that he said that if language closes its doors, it will disappear like a dinosaur
 modi ne aagaah kiya ki bazaar ko hindi kii darkaar he
 Hindi people should be ready for this
 agar modi or kuch had tak mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke vaktavy ko chhod den, to kaarykram kii baaki bhashaa or paath saamagree main clishtha hindi yaa sangh kii bhashaa main shuddhtavaadi hindi kaa jor dikhaai diya
 This is also natural to happen, as BJP MP and Sangh staunch activist Anil Madhav Dave has a key role in designing the event
 bhashaa ke istemaal main sabase zyada gajab videsh rajyamantri general wike singh ne kiya
 Singh had recently given a statement that official Hindi has made the plight of Hindi
 lekin ve khud sangrakshan jaise sidhe shabd kaa istemaal karne ke bajaay sangrakshakata jaise shabdkosh se baahar ke shabdon kaa istemaal dhanyavad gyaapan main karte rahe
 No Hindi writing on the stage One of the highlights of the inaugural function of the World Hindi Conference was that no writer, poet or artist got a chair on the stage
 pradhanmantri or videsh mantri is baat se bakhbar the or iske paksh main unki daleel thi ki yah sahitya kaa nahin, bhashaa kaa sammelan he
 But this argument does not embrace the fact that all the development of Hindi language is to be done by the leaders, who are the same people who are seen on the stage
 gauratlab he ki 1975 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne nagpur main jab pehle vishwa hindi sammelan kii neenv daali thi, to usamen mukhya bhaashan kavyitri mahadevi verma kaa hua tha
 Due to all these reasons, the established literature fraternity of the country is boycotting this event
 kaabiliyat hone ke baavjood kya aapako kahin naukari nahin mil paa rahi he? philhal jahaan kaam kar rahe hai, vahaan khush nahin hai? agar aisa he to aaj to ham aapke liye kuch aise upaay lekar aae hai, jinke liye mana jaataa he ki nishchit rup se manachaaha or aakarshak naukari dilaate hai

 dilli main bijepi kii chunaav samiti kii baithak jari he
 Sources are quoting from the news that Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha seat is set to be announced today, while Speaker Rajnath Singh may contest from Chittorgarh
 iske alaava uttar pradesh kii 50 se zyada siton par aaj faisla liya jayega jabaki meeting main gujarat par charchaa philhal nahin hogi
 The next meeting of the BJP will be held on 19 March
 
 
 
 So Banarsi will become Babu Modi In the election season, Modi came to Benaras to awaken the supporters and Baba Vishwanath, but himself went to become a Benares Babu
 banaras kii aabo hawa or raily main umade samarthakon kaa utsaah dekh modi philhal to dil se banarsi ho jane kaa dawa kar rahe hai, ab sambhaavna he seat se bhi banarsi babu ban jaaenge
 What happened to Murali Manohar Joshi, the old seeker of the Banaras seat, is upset with Modi's growing Banaras fascination
 party ke piem ummidavaar ko ye seat bha gai to bha gai
 What is the use of raising the question that when there is a Modi wave in the whole country, then why only look at the seat of Banaras? Modi can stand on the electoral wave from anywhere in the country
 maathapai jari he, chunaav samiti kii teen-teen baithken ho chuki hai, lekin is baat par faisla ab tak atka he ki modi aakhir ladege kahaan se? banaras ke sawaal par joshi ji ade hai, to lakhanu kii seat chhinane kii dehshat main lalji tandon laal-pile ho rahe hai
 Now just waiting for the meeting of BJP Election Committee, which is going to seal the final seat of Modi
 modi ko banaras seat milane ke myne or phaayde
 
 
 In the eyes of the BJP, if Modi contested from Varanasi seat, then the seats of entire Purvanchal will be benefited
 upi ke saath bihar kii siton par bhi bijepi ke kor vot bank ko sahi sanket jayega
 Along with the bjp's big group, the Sangh has also advocated for Modi to fight Varanasi
 varanasi seat kii kitni ahm he, iskaa andaja aresas kii gahari dilchaspee se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 On this, Amit Shah, the general secretary in charge of UP has consulted with the Sangh regarding Modi's candidature
 amit shah puure saal isi mashkkat main lage rahe
 The Sangh also conducted surveys in its own way, but a controversy arose over the candidature before Modi would stake his claim from there or the party would defend him
 joshi ji kii narazgi puraani ho gai, ab tak sangh na sirf modi kii ummidavaari ko lekar green signal de chukaa he, balki joshi ji kaa krodh shant karne kaa mantra bhi phoonk chukaa he
 Because the strategy is to take electoral advantage from Modi's wave in Purvanchal along with Gujarat
 is par bijepi main ekarey ban chuki he
 What about Joshi's complaint
 
 
 magar joshi ji kii shikaayat kaa kya hoga, jo philhal ansuni he
 If he was given the seat of Kanpur, where would Kalraj Mishra fight? The alternative may be of Lucknow, but the party president Rajnath Singh himself is eyeing this and Lal ji Tandon is also putting his own finger on it
 aise main bijepi kii nai list kaa intjaar sabko besabri se he
 Actress Nisha Mukherjee has been away from the big and small screen for quite some time
 tanishachhote parde par aakhri baar tivi siriyalbig bos(2013) main najar ai thim
 Tanisha was the first runner up in this reality TV show
 log jaanate hai ki tanisha bhale hi parde se dur hai lekin soshal media par vah ab bhi kaaphi sakriy rahati hai
 However, on Thursday, he shared a picture from his account that made headlines
 asal main tanisha ne apane acount se apni toplace tasviir share kar di thi
 In the caption of the picture, Tanisha wrote, "if you don't see anything beautiful in yourself, then you should buy a better mirror for yourself, my mirror does not need any cleaning
 shubh prabhaat duniya
 Be genuine bade parde kii baat karen to tanisha aakhri baar 2016 main ai film anna main najar ai thim
 The film was directed by Shashank Udapurkar
 film main tanisha ne ek patrkaar kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 Tanisha recently commented on social media after watching Kajol's film Helicopter Eela
 kaajol kii tarif karte hue tanisha ne likhaa, "meri bahan shandaar parformar he
 " bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne jammu-kashmir ke kathua gangrape or hatya maamle kii ninda kii he
 There has been resentment among the people across the country about this incident
 nai dilli main media ko sambodhit karte hue bijepi kii rashtriya pravaktaa minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki bijepi shuru se hi kathua or unnav balaatkaar maamalon ke khilaaf rahi he
 He also questioned why the recent rape and murder case in Assam did not get as much coverage as was given to Kathua and Unnao
 unhone bataaya ki 5veen class kii 12 saal kii chaatra kaa balaatkaar kar use petrol chhidakkar aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 Two other people were also involved in the case along with the main accused Zakir Hussain
 lekin is maamle ko kawarej nahin mila
 Lekhi also accused the media of not showing the bjp's remarks in the Kathua and Unnao rape case
 saath hi unhone congress ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki desh main kathua or unnav ke alaava bhi rape kii ghatnaayen hui hai
 Why did the Congress not carry out candle marches on other events
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar kii raat rahul gandhi ke aahwan par congress ne candal march nikaala tha
 Lekhi said that the strategy of these people can be seen
 pehle ye alpsankhyak-alpsankhyak chilla rahe the phir dalit-dalit chillane lage
 Now women and women are shouting and surround the center on the issues of the state government
 rajya sarkaron dwaara uthaae gaye jaruri sakht kadamon ko nazarandaaj karte hue ye log aise aarope laga rahe hai
 An 8-year-old was raped in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir and was then tragically killed
 vahiin, uttar pradesh ke unnav main ek kishori ne bijepi vidhayak par balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya, jiske baad uski shikaayat darj kii gai
 Amid growing controversy in the case, the CBI has detained and questioned the accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 senger ke party main bhavishya ke sawaal ko lekhi taalati najar ain
 He said that i do not know what is the truth of the case, so i do not want to say anything till the investigation in this case
 unhone upi kii bijepi sarkaar dwaara vidhayak ke khilaaf samay par karrwai na karne kii baat ko bhi nakaara
 Lekhi said that the incident happened 10 months ago in Unnao, the police took the victim's statement before the magistrate, in which the name of the BJP MLA was not taken
 lekhi ne kaha ki magistrate ke saamne bayaan dene ke baad peedita ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko patr likhakar vidhayak par aarope lagaaya
 After which action was taken on the MLA
 kathua gangrape cese par lekhi ne kaha ki bijepi is maamle main jammu kashmir ke do bijepi vidhayakon ke kaamon kaa samarthan nahin karti he
 Who were seen supporting the rape accused during a rally
 unhone kaha ki bijepi pehle hi vidhayakon ke kaamon kaa ninda kar chuki he

 It was 87 percent in 2014, compared to 97 percent in 2013

 ’ Delhi assembly election enthusiasts are at the peak, with 20-22 days left by counting fingers, when Delhi's command comes into hand, it will be closed in electronic voting machines
 is ladaai ko or dilachasp banane main jitna haath dilli ke sthapit netaaon kaa he, kamobesh utani hi bhagidaari is baar ke chunaav main kuch namchin mahilaon kii bhi nazar aa rahi he
 After Kiran Bedi, reports of Jayaprada and Shazia Ilmi joining the BJP are also strong
 agar dilli kii mukhyamantri ke taur par koi mahila shapath leti hai to ye apane aap main ek abhootpurv ghatana hogi, kyonki isse pehle agar arvind kejariwal ke 49 din ke alpashasan kaal ko chhod den to lagaataar 15 saal ke lambey samay tak dilli kii kursi par shila dikshit baithi raheen
 Again, this command, in the hands of a woman, is evidently going to feed the mood of Delhi too
 7 farvari ko jab dilli main voting hogi tab dilli main kul 1,30,85,251 vot daalenge, inamen se 72,60,633 purush or 58,24,618 mahila voter hongi
 This time 1
 72 lakh nae voter bhi shaamil honge to zaahir he unamem bhi ek badi sankhya mahilaon kii hogi
 In such a situation, we thought that a large population of educated women travels daily in the Delhi-metro called Delhi's heart, so why don't we go among them and try to know which leader is special for them at this time there is space? dilli metro ke vaishali se mandi house jane vaali train ke mahila kampartment main kadam rakhte hi meri nazar padi, bijepi ke naarangi or hare rang ke poster par, jisapar hameshaa kii tarah muskuraate hue modi nazar aa rahe hai, 'chalo chalem modi ke saath' ke naare ke saath
 i started an informal conversation with two young girls Pooja and Neha (who are physically challenged children's special educators) and asked what should be the Chief Minister of Delhi? To which Pooja said, a person who can do good work
 donon ladakiyon ne bataaya ki naukrishuda hone ke kaaran unke liye sabase ahm mudda suraksha kaa he taaki ve kisi bhi vakshe bagaiyr kisi baadha ke kahin bhi aa-ja sake
 Both the girls said two things that they are confident that Kejriwal is a very honest man and will also work, but he is not in the mood to give him a chance again after the last time he resigned
 in ladakiyon ne kaha ki raajnneeti koi angan main khele jane waal stapu yani kit-kit kaa khel nahin he ki jab chaha chhod kar chale gaye
 Sheila Dixit or Congress is nowhere in their mind, and they are impressed by Modi's work
 haalanki jab maine poocha ki modi kaa koi ek faisla bataaen jo inhen bahut acha laga ho to donon bataa nahin paayi
 Then i caught the train on the second route where Kejriwal's posters are placed in the entire compartment
 in posters main kejariwal agle paanch saalon main dilli main har jagah sisitivi camera, mobile phone par suraksha batnaa or bason va metro main security marshalls tainaat karne kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 Here i started a conversation with Shubhra
 shubhra ek marketing form main kaam karti hai, maine inase poocha ki ye jo posters lage hai kya isse aapaki kisi netaa yaa party ke prati soch main koi badlaav yaa samaj develop hoti he? Shubhra's answer was - It makes a difference, for example, when we go to the market to buy clothes, we also buy some accessories there, what we see is first part of our thinking and then our decisions
 shubhra ko bhi kejariwal se shikaayat he lekin kahati hai ki ve ek baar unhen phir se mauka dena chahengi
 
 kyonki unako lagata he ki ve mahilaon, garibon, aam janata or khaaskar bacchon ke shiksha kii disha main behatar kaam karenge
 Working as a homeopathic doctor at the Defense Colony's Nehru Medical College, Ritika says that these posters affect those who are less educated
 ham jaise log jo multiple medium of communications se jude hue hai unhen apana nirnay lene ke liye in postaron kii zaroorat nahin he
 Although Ritika also admitted that Kejriwal is an honest man but now she does not trust him, and the central government is doing quite well
 pradhanmantri modi ke kaaran hamaare bheetar aatmavishvaas jagaa he
 i continued my journey on the second day i
e
 even today, and by then Kiran Bedi had arrived in the electoral field
 peshey se chartd acountint rajani or soochna or praudyogiki mantralay main karyrat nita ke mutabik centre main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad sarkari daftaron ke kaam-kaaj main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa he
 Earlier officers did not come at all, now everyone comes on time and also works
 in donon kaa kahana tha ki kejariwal achche vyakti hai or unhone kaam bhi kiya tha, lekin chunki unki sarkaar congress ke samarthan par thi to ho saktaa he ki ve kisi dabaav main rahe hon, modi sarkaar ke saath aisa nahin he, or ab jabaki paridrishy main kiran bedi bhi aa gai hai to hamaare liye unpar bharosa karnaa juyada aasaan hai, kyonki unamem wo saare gun hai jo kejariwal main he
 
 
 
 lekin unka ek mahila hona hamen swaabhaavik taur par unke kareeb le jaataa he
 Richa of Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar says that she likes Kejriwal very much, but after the coming of Modi government, the prices of petrol-diesel have come down, inflation has come down and the safety of women is being taken care of
 Would like to give a chance to kyonki kejariwal raajnneeti main bachche hai
 As i walked towards Sarabjit in Shastri Nagar, he and his two other friends standing with me shouted together that Madam Bedi is our first choice
 
 
 agar wo nahin hotin to kejariwal hote lekin ab jab bedi bijepi kii candidet hai to hamen lagata he ki agar ham kejariwal ko vot denge to wo west ho jayega or ham apane vot ko west nahin karnaa chaahate
 By the time i reached my destination, i had understood that how much of the master stroke played by Prime Minister Modi or BJP will affect the election results, it will tell the time to come but changing the hearts and minds of women voters of Delhi That Kavayad has slowly started on the right
