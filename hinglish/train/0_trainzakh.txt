 The Gujarat government on Thursday framed rules for compulsory voting in local elections in the state, imposed a fine of Rs 100 for not voting and for not making satisfactory disclosures
 haalanki swasthya, shiksha or anya milakar 12 kaarnon se voting na karne par chhot bhi de di gai he
 But the question is arising whether the government has completed its 'ego' by making this rule
 gujarat main matdaan anivaary karne ke liye pehali baar bill narendra modi, bataur mukhyamantri laae the
 The trick was that in this bill 50 percent women reservation was also added in local elections
 saalon tak yah maamla kendra kii upie sarkaar dwaara banaae gaye rajyapal or gujarat ke bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri ke bich sangharsh kaa mudda bana rahaa
 The governor kept saying that it is not possible to make voting compulsory, it is a violation of fundamental rights
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar mahila aarakshan or anivaary matdaan ke liye alag-alag bill paarit kare, taaki mahila aarakshan lagu kiya ja sake
 The Narendra Modi government repeatedly passed the same bill in the Legislative Assembly without any reshuffle
 sarkaar ne aarope lagaaya tha ki rajyapal mahila aarakshan lagu nahin hone de rahi hai
 This endless struggle continued
 aakhir sangharsh khatm hua kendra main bhi bhaajapa kii sarkaar aane ke baad
 Now the governor was also made by him, Narendra Modi has become the prime mover of the bill
 aise main bill to paas hona hi tha, rajyapal ne manjuur bhi kar liya
 About 6 months have passed since the bill was approved
 mahila aarakshan ko lekar niyam turant bana die gaye the lekin voting anivaary karne ke liye niyam banane ko lekar jaddojahad ab tak jari thi
 There was also a fear that if the penalty is excessive, people will not get angry and BJP will not have to bear the brunt of it
 ab bich kaa rasta nikaala gaya he
 The fine has also been imposed for 100 rupees, ie name only
 voting na karne ke liye aam taur par middle class or samrudh tabake ko kosa jaataa he
 There can never be any harm in paying a fine of Rs 100 to this class
 sawaal aata he garibon kaa
 Most of the poor have gone away from their homes in search of work
 zyaadaatar adivasee mazdooree ke liye shaharon main jate hai
 Only in monsoon do we go home to do farming
 aise main agar voting kerani he to unhen 500 se 1000 rupee kharch kar or mazdooree kaa khamiyaja bhugatkar janaa hoga
 Will it be in their interest? shaharon main jo garib kaam karte hai ve agar ek din kaam par nahin jaaenge to unhen unki dihadi, jo 100 rupee se lekar 500 rupee tak ho sakati he, se haath dhonaa padegaa
 In such a situation, they have to die from both sides
 yaa to sarkaar paisa legi yaa maalik paisa kaat legaa
 When i spoke to some people, they said that if we walk on a two-wheeler, wearing a helmet is not good at all
 is kaaran trephic police ko 50 - 100 rupaya jurmaana to har mahine de dete hai
 It is a matter of giving it only once in 5 years
 yani sirf 100 rupaya jurmaana bemaani he
 The comments isse bhi ahm baat yah he ki kya mujhe vot dene ke liye sarkaar jabardastee kar sakati he? kya ham sarkaar par jabardastee kar sakate hai ki aisi vyavastha bane ki hamen acha lage, aise logon ko hi rajnatik partiyaan umidavaar ke taur par khadaa karen? kya vot dena yaa na dena meraa nijee adhikaar nahin he? kya sarkaar mujh par jabardastee karke meri aazaadee chin nahin rahi he? It is important that the Congress, which is calling it a violation of fundamental rights here, has passed the bill for mandatory voting in the gram panchayats in Karnataka in the Vidhan Sabha
 dekhnaa he ki is mudde par aage raajnneeti kisi chalati he
 For the first time, the bill was brought by Narendra Modi as Chief Minister to make voting mandatory in Gujarat
 chaalaaki yah thi ki isi bill main sthaneey chunaavon main 50 pratishat mahila aarakshan bhi jod diya gaya tha
 For years, the issue remained a matter of conflict between the Governor appointed by the UPA Government at the Center and the BJP Chief Minister of Gujarat
 rajyapal kehete rahe ki voting anivaary kar paanaa sambhav nahin he, yah moulik adhikaron kaa hanan he
 He said that the government should pass separate bills for women reservation and compulsory voting, so that women reservation can be implemented
 narendra modi sarkaar ne bina koi pherbadal kiye baar-baar yahi bill vidhansabha main paarit kiya
 The government had alleged that the Governor was not allowing women's reservation to be implemented
 yah antaheen sangharsh chalata rahaa
 After all, the struggle ended after the BJP government came to power at the center
 ab rajyapal bhi unheen ke banaae hue the, bill ke mukhya prastaavak narendra modi pradhanmantri ban chuke hai
 In such a situation the bill had to be passed, the governor also approved it
 bill manjuur hue kareeb 6 mahine biit gaye hai
 Rules for women reservation were made immediately, but the struggle to make rules to make voting mandatory was still continuing
 dar bhi tha ki kahin jurmaana zyada rakh diya to log naaraaz na ho jaaen or bhaajapa ko iskaa khamiyaja na bhugatna pad jaae
 Now the middle path has been drawn
 jurmaana bhi 100 rupee, yani naam bhar ke liye hi rakhaa gaya he
 The middle class and the affluent class are generally accused of not voting
 is varg ko 100 rupee jurmaana dene main kabhi harj nahin ho saktaa
 The question comes from the poor
 zyaadaatar garib apane ghar-baar se dur kaam kii talash main gaye hote hai
 Most of the tribals go to the cities for wages
 sirf monsoon main kheti karne ke liye hi ghar jate hai
 In such a situation, if you want to vote, then they have to spend 500 to 1000 rupees and suffer the brunt of wages
 kya yah unke hit main hoga
 If the poor who work in cities will not go to work one day, then they will have to lose their daily wages, which can range from Rs 100 to Rs 500
 aise main unhen to donon taraf se maranaa he
 Either the government will take the money or the owner will deduct the money
 jab kuch logon se meri baat hui to unhone kaha ki ham tu-whealer par chalate hai to helmet pahananaa jaraa bhi acha nahin lagata
 For this reason, the traffic police pay a fine of 50 - 100 rupees every month
 yah to 5 saal main ek baar hi dene kii baat he
 That is, just 100 rupees fine is meaningless
 tippaniyan More importantly, can the government force me to vote? Can we force the government to make such a system that we like it, to make such people stand as political parties? Is it not my personal right to vote or not to vote? Is the government not forcing me to take away my freedom? mahatvapurn yah he ki jo congress yahaan par ise moulik adhikaron kaa hanan bataa rahi he, unheen kii sarkaar ne karnataka main gram panchayaton main voting anivaary karne kaa bill vidhansabha main paarit kar diya he
 It remains to be seen how politics will proceed on this issue

 iraq kii ek factory main hui ek chori kii vaardaat ne is baar puri duniya ko daraa diya he kyonki jis cheez kii chori hui he, wo ek radioective meterial he or jis par chori kaa shaq he, wo iesas he
 In such a situation, if ISIS has made a dirty bomb using this material, then how dreadful it can be, its thinking is that the world is being scared because the victims of the dirty bomb start melting bones and people They die with sesame seeds
 chori ne paidaa kiya darais duniya main chori kii har roj namaaloom kitni vaaradaaten hoti hai, lekin dakshini iraqi shahar basra main is baar ek aisi chori hui he, jisane madhya asia se lekar europe or rus se lekar america tak sabko daraa diya he
 It is a matter to ponder because how did a theft pose such a big threat to the world? But the real story behind this theft is really creepy
 kyonki agar ye chor jaldi pakade nahin gaye, to yakeen maniye ki sirf is chori kii vajah se hi duniya main lakhon log apni jaan se ja sakate hai or wo bhi tadap-tapad kar
 Radioactive material missing from Iraq, in fact, several capsules of a very creepy radioactive material have disappeared from a factory in Basra
 vaise to is meterial kaa istemaal aam taur par gas or tel kii pipeline main bahaav ko banaae rakhane or cancer ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he, lekin isi radioective meterial kii chapet main aane se insaan maut ke munh main bhi samaa saktaa he or bhi tadap-tadap kar
 The most worrying among them is that ISIS terrorists are suspected to be behind the theft of this material
 aise main agar iesas ne is meterial kaa istemaal kar koi darty bam bana liya, to uske dhamaake se kahaan or kisi tabaahi machegi, iskaa andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he
 In fact, the use of radioactive material in conventional methods of explosion is known by the world as Dirty Bomb and under new circumstances, the biggest threat of ISIS Dirty Bomb is to its enemy countries like America, Russia, England and France
 bina taal tode yaa nuksaan pahunchaae hui chorisutron kii maane to iaar-192 ke naam se janaa janevaala ye meterial ek america tel company ke workshop main puri hifaazat se rakhaa tha, lekin ek roj achaanak laptop ke sijwale ek bakse main rakhaa ye meterial gaayab paaya gaya
 It was also surprising that the thieves stealing the radioactive material did not break any lock or damage the factory or the boxes to make it disappear, but in a very cunning manner, they took all the goods by keeping watch of the security personnel
 
 iesas par shakajankaron kii maane to chori kaa ye tarika dekh kar ye baat saaf he ki chori ke peeche kisi aise shaks kaa haath he, jise radioective meterial or uske khatre kaa ehsaas he or yahi vajah he ki usne chori karne main bhi puri ehtiyaat barti he
 In such a situation, the first doubt of all the security agencies is towards ISIS
 vaise basra se iesas ke kabje vaale ilaake kii duuri takreeban 300 mile he, lekin isshaharake aas-paas duusare virdohi guton or ladaakon kii maujuudagi jarur he
 If radioactive material is dangerous, according to public opinion, this radioactive material can be used not only through bombs, but also by keeping it open in a crowded place
 ye meterial itnaa khatarnaak he ki ek ghante yaa usase zyada tak agar koi iske sampark main aata he, to uski maut tay he
 In such a situation, if ISIS or any other faction blasts this radioactive material with just one IED, then its dreadful results can come
 yahi vajah he ki iraqi sarkaar ke saath-saath ab tamamsuraksha agenciyambhi har haal main chori gaye is meterial ko dobaaraa hasil karnaa chaahati he, taaki begunaahon ko khaufnak maut se bachaaya ja sake
 Is there anyone around you who keeps flirting all the time? If yes, let me tell you that this is not unusual
 zyaadaatar mardon ko flert karnaa acha lagata he
 They get a different pleasure in doing so
 wo is kaam ko kaaphi injoy karte hai
 In most cases girls do not like boys who flirt, but if flirt partner is doing, then they too like it
 par kya aapane kabhi ye sochaa he ki mard flert karte kyon hai? ho saktaa he ki wo aapako pasand karata ho or isi kaaran aisa kar rahaa ho lekinye ekmaatr kaaran nahin he
 Apart from this, there are many other reasons why men flirt
 1
 You may be surprised by reading, but it is true that flirting brings confidence in men
 darasal, flert karne ke liye bahut himmat kii jarurat hoti he or jab wo aisa karne main kaamyaab ho jate hai to unhen lagata he ki unhone bahut kuch hasil kar liya
 2
 kai baar mardon ko lagata he ki flert karke hivo apni baat aage badha sakate hai
 They feel that by doing this, they can convey their heart to the girl whom they like
 bhale hi ye sidhaa rasta na ho lekin pehali baar baat karne ke liye unhen flert karnaa hi sabase aasaan lagata he
 3
 flert karne se purushon ko energy milti he
 Most men feel that this is a sinful task and they see it as a task
 4
 It is a means of entertainment for most men
 par aise ladakon se saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat hoti he
 5
 kai baar kisi ke saath rishta shuru karne ke liye bhi purush flert kaa sahaara lete hai
 This is the oldest and most popular way of starting a conversation
 is maamle main karti par 10 lakh rupee kii rishwat lene kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Apart from this, on the basis of information about alleged illegal payments made by INX Media, CBI also registered a case against Karti Chidambaram and others
 (input bhashaa se) Former President of the country and senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee is reaching Nagpur today at the invitation of RSS
 wo yahaan 7 june ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sangh shiksha varg ke samaapan samaaroh main mukhya atithi honge
 Significantly, this decision of Pranab Mukherjee was opposed by many Congress leaders
 kuch ne kaha tha ki wo aisa nahin kar sakate, ham unase baat karenge
 At the same time, some Congress leaders reminded Pranab of his old statements against the Sangh
 vaise to RSS kii taraf se in bayanon par koi pratikriya nahin ai he lekin aaj indian express main RSS ke sah-sarkarywah dow
 Manmohan Vaidya has written an article which can be seen as a response to these statements
 'pranab da, nagpur main aapkaa swaagat he’ sheershak se likhe gaye apane lekh main manmohan vaidya ne congress or left ke netaaon ko nishane par lete hue likhaa he,'pranab da desh ke purv raashtrapati hone ke alaava congress ke bade netaa bhi hai lekin kisi bhi swayamsevak ne unhen RSS ke kaarykram main bulaane kaa virodh nahin kiya
 At the same time, a section of Congress and Left leaders opposed it, expressing their disagreement
 hamen in donon pratikriyaaon ko samajhnaa hoga
 In his article, Manmohan Vaidya, while targeting the left parties and the left-wing intellectual section, wrote that in this country for years there has been a section which never accepted open dialogue in the country and the world
 unhone likhaa he ki agar koi left kii baton se sahamat nahin he to wo sanghee he
 In his article, he has also recalled the occasions when newspaper editors, people from other parties, kept distance from RSS
 ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue wo likhte hai, 'bataur prachaar pramukh ek baar main kolkata gaya tha
 The Left was then led by the CPM government in the state
 sthaneey RSS karyaalay ne da stateman, da indian express, da times of india, vartmaan va left se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale duusare akhabaaron ke sampadakon ke saath meri mulaakaat ke liye koshish kii
 But everyone refused and i was told that the editors said they did not want to waste their time meeting me
 ’is lekh main unhone aise kai maukon ke bare main likhaa he jab unase yaa RSS ke duusare netaaon se logon ne keval isliye milane se manaa kar diya tha kyonki wo RSS se the
 At the same time, in his article, Manmohan Vaidya has described RSS as an organization to meet and listen to those who have different views and that is why RSS has called former President of India and senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee on its platform
 
 is sambandh main ek ghatana kaa zikr karte hue manmohan vaidya likhte hai, 'kuch saal pehle chini communist party(sipisi) kaa ek dal bharat daure par aayaa tha
 The CPC party had also expressed a desire to meet the leaders of the union
 hamane unase kaha ki aap ek raajnneetik party hai or ham sidhe-sidhe samaaj main kaam karte hai
 We have nothing to do with politics, so what is the need of this meeting? So his reply came that the CPC is a cadre based political party and the Sangh is also a cadre based organization
 iske baad ham aapas main mili or hamaari mulakaat acchhee rahi
 'overall, it can be said that through this article, the Sangh has given a befitting reply to the leaders who are raising questions about Pranab Mukherjee going to Nagpur and participating in the RSS program

 During the three years during which i lived in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya, and covered that area, i did not think it necessary to write a single serious news about that state
 yah vaaki gambhir maamla he
 The truth is that Meghalaya was very quiet and relaxed when fires broke out in Nagaland, Mizoram and Tripura and life in Assam was stalled that pipelines sending crude oil to India were also closed

 The Northeast in our national consciousness was a story of revolt and extremism, a threat to national security, a fragile frontier, as Marhum Loksev Nari Rustomji said in her beautiful book
 purvottar hamaare liye ek aisa kshetra tha jisaki raksha kii jaani thi or kuch mutthi bhar anjaan-si vividh janajatiyaan thim jinase hamen khud ko bachaana tha
 Just like Kashmir, our commitment to this region was just that we had to save the ownership of this area

 The Northeast was a legend of national security and once the danger arose the news itself died
 kareeb chauthai sadi guzar gai or baaki kshetra bhi meghalaya kii tarah ab shant ho gaya he or isiilie vah hamaare rashtriya (indian?) radar par nahin aata he
 That is why when a group of relatively marginalized militants killed a consignment of our soldiers, we did not understand how to react
 phir aisa laga, goyaa kisi kism kaa badla le liya gaya he or ham dobaaraa sab kuch bhul gaye, khaskar isliye kyonki ham bharatiyon par kisi or hamale kii khabar nahin ai
 In this era of constantly diverting attention and grand ideas to 140 characters, while dissertations are also being decided on the basis of whether something is in practice, it would be foolish and complacent to talk about a news story that lasts a week
 Already his death has died on the eastern outskirts of the country and a new Modi has been overshadowed

 This is because when harsh state militarism replaces democratic and emotional power, then the worst mistakes happen

 And if the worst treatment of Kashmiris happened in any phase, as shown in the film Hyder and which shook one of the staunch people, it was also during the period of 'indecisive' Rao

 There were two reasons for this

 Secondly, you do not slap your chest by killing the people of your own country, then it does not matter how responsible they may have been for this and what atmosphere there is against them in the country

 i was not asking this question to say that we should leave the army on the poorest tribals of Central India, but my question was related to one principle: Why do we have any doubt in using the same armed force against the Kashmiri and Northeast rebels? does not happen? Are they not their Indian people, or are they less Indian than the Maoists in the mainland, who today are a greater threat than any Naga group or other militant groups in the Northeast? Let me assure you that there will be no celebration or chest-thumping in doing so
 rashtriya suraksha kaa hamaara sara vimarsh isi buniyadi paakhand se bharaa padaa he

 desh badla par bhartiya cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kii chuppi nahin tuuti
 It seems that Dhoni has refused to break the ban of the BCCI
 unhone ek baar phir se is masale par puche gayi sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin diya
 He just said that some players are mentally weaker than others
 champions trophy se pehle samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue dhoni ne saaf kiya ki vah haal ke vivaadon ko lekar kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin denge
 He, however, said that he would definitely break his silence at the right time
 press conference se pehle isisi ke ek adhikari ne patrakaron se kaha ki baatcheet keval champions trophy tak hi simit honi chahie
 In a similar manner, the media manager of the Indian team also intervened in the press conference before the team's departure on Tuesday
 mumbai main sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin dene ke kaaran media or camentataron ne dhoni kii kadi aalochana kii thi
 One journalist, however, questioned Dhoni about spot fixing, to which he said, "if i did not reply to Indian journalists, then i see no reason to answer you
" main sahi samay par baat karuunga
 'significantly, in the press conference held in India, Dhoni also made up his mind to remain silent
 phixing se jude har sawaal kaa jawaab unki chuppi hoti thi
 Dhoni did not even answer the question till date
 haalanki ek mauka aisa bhi aayaa jab vindu daara singh ko nijee taur par jaanane ke sawaal par dhoni sirf muskuraae
 After the voting in 89 seats in the first round of Gujarat assembly elections, it is difficult to say that there is a political wave or atmosphere in favor of any one political party, but there is a fierce contest between BJP and Congress
 rajya ke jin ilaakon main pehle daur ke matdaan hue, vahaan ke alag-alag kshetron se alag-alag khabaren aa rahi hai
 The picture of the urban area is telling something, while the rural areas are something else
 is baar chunavi tasviir saaf nahin hai
 This is the reason that after the first round, the bjp-congress seems to be in a dilemma, but both political parties are claiming an edge over the tongue so that in the second phase, the electoral atmosphere can be created in their favor
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavamein pehle charan ke matdaan ke baad raajnneetik panditon ke bich nateezon ko lekar bahes jari he
 Although the BJP is expecting a return to power, the condition of the Congress is stronger than before, on which many political pundits fully agree
 pichhali baar se 4 fisadi kam hua matadaanabta den ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle daur main shanivaar ko saurashtra-kuccha or dakshin gujarat ke 19 jilon kii 89 siton par matdaan hue
 The remaining 93 seats in the state will go to polls in the second phase on December 14
 chunaav ayog ke mutabik pehle charan main 68 fisadi voting hui
 Whereas in the last assembly election of 2012, about 72 percent voting was held in these seats
 is tarah dekha jaae to kareeb 4 fisadi matdaan kam hue hai
 Revenge of saurashtra-kutch Saurashtra region is very important in the politics of Gujarat
 saurashtra-kuccha main kareeb 54 siten aati hai
 This entire area is considered to be Patidar multiplicity
 bijepi kaa ye majboot garh rahaa he
 The BJP has been reaching the throne of power with this fort for the last two decades
 lekin is baar pehle daur ke hue matdaan ne bijepi ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Voting in all districts of Saurashtra was lower than last time
 saurashtra kshetra main shanivaar ko hue matdaan kaa puraa ausat nikaalte hai to wo kareeb 64 fisadi ke kareeb pahunchataa he
 Whereas last time around 70 percent voting was done in this area
 'bijepi ke khilaaf wo gussa najar nahin aayaa'gujarat central university ke professor jai prakaash pradhan kehete hai ki bijepi se patidaar samaaj naaraaz maane ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it seemed that in Saurashtra, the Patidars would step up and vote against the BJP
 jis prakaar 2015 ke jila panchayat ke chunaav main kiya tha or bijepi kaa safaya kar diya tha
 Out of 11 Zilla Panchayat seats in Saurashtra, BJP had won only one seat in the account, Congress won the remaining 10 seats
 vidhansabha ke chunaav ke matdaan main bijepi ke khilaaf wo gussa najar nahin aayaa
 Gujarat political analysis and social activist Ashim Roy says that it is difficult for the BJP in Saurashtra to repeat the results earlier this time
 patidaar vot jis prakaar bijepi ke paksh main ekamusth jate the wo is baar ke chunaav main nahin hua
 The Patidars of Saurashtra had a large section in favor of the Congress, while the BJP won more than two-thirds of the seats in the 2012 assembly elections from Saurashtra, but this time the Congress is likely to get more seats than before
 unka kahana he ki gramin ilaakon main congress ke paksh main matdaan hue hai, to shahari kshetra main bijepi
 The decision of South Gujarat was held in the hands of tribals in about 35 seats in South Gujarat
 saurashtra kii tarah dakshin gujarat main kisi ek jati kaa varchasv nahin he
 There are more or less all castes in this area, but there are many assembly seats in this region where tribal societies play an important role
 dakshin gujarat ke narmada, bharuch, daing, tapi or balsath jile aise hai, jahaan adivasee bahulya he
 The previous elections in Bharuch and Tapi in these tribal districts in favor of Congress have seen low turnout, but the rest of the districts of South Gujarat have witnessed a large turnout
 jai prakaash pradhan kehete hai ki dakshin gujarat main chotu bhai vasava se congress kii dosti bijepi ke liye musiibat kaa sabab sabit ho sakati he
 a large section of tribals appeared in favor of Congress
 gramin ilaakon main jabardast votingashim roy kehete hai ki dakshin gujarat main kisaan or vyapaariyon kii badi taadaad he, kisaanon main maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf gussa he to vyapaaree bhi virodh main hai
 BJP has been successful in persuading the traders to a great extent, but it has not reduced the anger of the farmers
 isiilie vyapaariyon kaa bada tabaka bijepi ke sang kal dikhaa to vahiin kisaan congress ke paksh main the
 That is why voting has taken place in large numbers in rural areas
 asamanjas ke bich bijepi-congress ke daavegujarat chunaav ke pehle daur ke matdaan ke baad bijepi or congress asamanjas main hai
 Despite this, claims are being made by both the parties for the lead
 taaki baaki bachi 93 vidhansabha siton kaa maahaul unke paksh main ban sake
 In the second phase, polling is to be held in the constituencies of North Gujarat and Central Gujarat
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki use 120 siton se adhik par jeet milane ja rahi he
 At the same time, BJP President Amit Shah is talking about winning 150 seats by beating the tal, while Ahmed Patel from Congress is also looking at winning 110 seats

 adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki sibiai computer graphics shikshak rijawanur rahamaan kii maut ke maamle main hatya kaa maamla darj kare or jaanch nae sire se ek baar phir shuru kare
 The body of Rizwanur was found lying near the railway tracks

 adaalat kii khandpeeth ne 18 may ko apane faisle main kaha tha ki rijawanur ke bhai rukbanur rahamaan ne 21 sitambar, 2007 ko jo shikaayat darj karai he, sibiai use praathmiki ke taur par le
 The bench also noted that Justice Soumitra Paul in his earlier order had ordered the CBI to submit a report on the matter only by ordering an inquiry into the cause of death, and authorized the agency to investigate the alleged crime

 yun to siyasat main koi apana nahin hota lekin desh ke baaki hisson kii tarah tamilnadu ke rajaneta bhi satta par pakad banaae rakhane ke liye rishtedaaron par hi bharosa karte hai
 a hallmark of this was seen when Sasikala got her nephews TTV Dinakaran and s Venkatesh back in the party just before going to jail
 ab sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki shashikala khemaa dinakaran ko mantri banane kii taiyaari main tha
 If the sources of such cut Dinakaran were considered, then the list of Palaniswami ministers who had taken to the Governor Vidyasagar Rao, Dinakaran was also named in it
 lekin governor ne unke naam par aitraaj kiya
 Rao said that he would have to seek legal advice before administering the oath to Dinakaran
 aisa isliye dinakaran ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke cese chal rahe hai
 Hence Palaniswamy's oath-taking can be postponed
 jaahir he palanisvami aisa nahin chaahate the, lihaaja dinakaran kaa naam mantriyon kii suchi se kaat diya gaya
 Who is Dinakaran? TTV Dinakaran is the son of Sasikala's late sister Vanithamani
 wo philhal rajyasabha saansad hai
 Dinakaran first made headlines in 1996 when Jayalalithaa spent crores of rupees at the wedding of her adopted son Sudhakaran
 dinakaran ke bhai sudhakaran se jayalalita ne kai saal pehle naata tod liya tha lekin dinakaran lambey vakt tak jayalalita ke kareebi rahe
 Between 1991 and 1995, disproportionate amounts were deposited in their accounts
 us vakt jayalalita mukhyamantri thi
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) then filed a case against him under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA)
 idi ke praadhikaran ne unpar 25 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha jise is saal janvari main madras hoicourt ne barkaraar rakhaa tha
 In 2011, Jayalalithaa fired Dinakaran and his brother from the party after receiving complaints of interfering with the work of the party and the government
 lekin shashikala naa sirf unhen party main waapas lekar ain balki unhen up-mahasachiv bhi bana diya

 There were some such cases, which despite being old, remained a problem for the police and the CBI this year

 Those have not been revealed yet
 lekin in maamalon main hone vaali har karrwai par puure desh kii najar lagi rahi
 The case of Pratyusha Banerjee's death The death of the famous TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee, the female bride, also remained a challenge for the police and investigative agencies this year
 isi saal 4 april ko sandigdh halaat main pratyusha kii maut ho gai thi
 But till now the case of his death is complicated between murder and suicide
 is maamle main pratyusha ke boyfriend rahulraj singh par use suicide ke liye uksaane kaa iljaam he
 The police also arrested him
 lekin rahul ko jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 He is currently out of jail

 Which showed that Pratyusha was badly angry with Rahul and broke down
 rahul use dehavyapaar main dhakelnaa chahta tha
 But the police have not yet reached any concrete result in this matter

 Apart from Delhi Police, Ghaziabad Police is also looking for the killers

 8 november 2016 ko kendra sarkaar ne notebandi kaa ahm elaan karte hue sanchaar main kul 86 fisadi karency ko amaanya ghoshit kar diya
 After this, the process of depositing the invalid currency of 500 and 1000 rupees into the bank lasted for several days
 lekin abhi bhi kendra sarkaar ke paas notebandi ke baad desh ke bainkon ke paas jamaa hui puraani karency kaa koi aankada maujuud nahin he
 The Committee of Parliament will present its report on demonetisation in the impending monsoon session of Parliament and the Reserve Bank Governor will not be called anymore on the issue of demonetisation
 vitt par sansad kii sthaayee samiti kii teen ghante se adhik chali baithak main rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel se kai sawaal puche gaye
 Even in these questions, the most important question arose regarding the number of old currency deposited in banks
 lekin ek baar phir rigerv bank ke governor is sawaal kaa jawaab yah dete hue taal gaye ki unke paas philhal aankada nahin he kyonki jamaa hui pratibandhit karency ko ginaney kaa kaam abhi bhi jari he
 Demonetisation wrong move, Modi's decision hurts economy: Krugman Now the question is, after the announcement of demonetisation, did banks deposit old currency from their customers without counting and without entering into their ledger? If it is not, then why the central bank was not able to collect their ledger data from all the banks of the country, so that it can be clearly told how much number of old currency has been returned to the bank after 8 November
 baar-baar rigerv bank se is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mil paane se sambhaavna ban rahi he ki desh kaa kendriya bank puraani karency kii sankhya ke maamle main kuch chipa rahaa he
 Perhaps the biggest lie of Vonotbandi is that after coming out, not only the Reserve Bank but the Modi government is sure to be shaky
 yahi vajah he ki ise chupaaya ja rahaa he

 Ram Madhav attacked Naidu and said that Naidu is known for promising Khilafi and has a long history
 unhone kaha ki isse pehle bhi chandrababu kai baar dal-badal kar chuke hai
 Ram Madhav said that we have sufficient strength and there is no threat to the government in any way from the motion of no confidence

 Bhalerao, who is present with the government officials and hundreds of farmers present in the meeting, says, “we have not received the payment of the crop for the last six months and now nobody in the sugar factory is willing to talk to us
 ' unka dukhada sun mukhyamantri ne unhen aashwaasan diya ki unka bhugtan jald hi kar diya jayega
 Earlier, Pankaja Munde's office had told NDTV that it could not confirm with certainty whether Bhairao had supplied sugarcane to the ministry's factory, though he would pay half of his dues within the next one or two months
 Will do it tippaniyan Bhalerao's appeal shows the way sugar mills are operating
 ullekhneey he ki atyadhik utpaadan ke chalate chini ke daam neeche aa gaye hai or chini factoriyon ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he or isi vajah se kisaanon kaa bhugtan nahin ho paa rahaa he

 Chief Minister Fadnavis was addressing a farmers' gathering in Parbhani, when farmer Madhav Bhalerao stood up and said that for the last six months a factory in the state government, minister Pankaja Munde, has not given him crop money
 sabha main maujuud sarkari adhikariyon or saikadon kisaanon ke saath maujuud bhalerao kehete hai, ' beete chah maheene se hamen fasal kaa bhugtan nahin mila or ab to chini kaarkaane main koi bhi hamase baat karne ko taiyaar nahin

 Pointing to the government camps for providing free fodder to cattle, CM Fadnavis said, "never before has there been a camp for fodder in the month of August

 a few weeks back she managed to get in 5 reps at 50 kgs and she rocked it
 Today was lifting day and we felt we had the energy to push that weight a little higher
 After a few warm up sets she cruised through 3 reps at 60kgs which was a personal best for her anyway (I missed a count and i got the stare)
 Next, we decided to push it even further and do just 1 rep at 70 kgs - knowing @aliaabhatt she decided to give me 2 for good measure
 Love the fact that she just NEVER backs down from what’s put in front of her
 New personal best done and now we're going to try and smash it again, soon
 What say? Stay the same @aliaabhatt - we’ve got a lot of work to do

 niti ayog kii report main upi kii badahaal sevaaon or dharm-jati ke naam par ho rahe aparaadhon ko lekar basapa supremeo mayawati ne uttar pradesh sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Mayawati, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and head of Bahujan Samaj Party, attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party government and said that BJP is a double-engineered government, so why is it not able to stop casteist and religious fanatics
 mayawati ne bijepi par ye nishaanaa twit ke jariye kiya
 In a tweet in the famous mob lynching case of Jharkhand, Mayawati said, 'why do BJP governments allow such casteist and religiously heinous crimes to be perpetrated in their states, which bring not only the entire state and the government there but also the country and the PM They also have to be embarrassed
 vaise ab to police va sarkari karmchaaree bhi is nai afat ke shikaar hai
 In the National Health Index released by NITI Aayog, Uttar Pradesh ranks at the bottom of the country
 upi kii kharaab swasthya sevaaon par mayawati ne rajya sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 He wrote, 'niti Aayog report is to shame the government that UP is the most backward state in the country in terms of public health
 ' mayawati niti ayog kii report ko lekar jahaan sarkaar par hamalavar huin, vahiin sarkaar ko dabl ingine vaali sarkaar bataaya
 Mayawati raised questions about poor health services, what is the benefit of such a double-engineered BJP government? Such development for which work of crores of people, in which his life remains completely hell? He has blamed the entire state for mob litching
 haalanki isse pehle buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main piem ne kaha tha ki jharkhand main mob linching kii ghatana se vah aahat hai
 He said that it is not correct to say that Jharkhand has become the base of mob lynching
 unhone kaha ki kya puure jharkhand rajya ko doshi bataa dena sahi he? jo bura hua he use alag karen
 We will do politics by keeping everyone in the dock, but we do not have the right to discredit the entire Jharkhand, there is also a lot of gentlemen
 nyaay ho, iske liye kanoonee vyavastha he
 Mayawati is constantly attacking the BJP government these days
 saath hi loksabhaa main apni sahyogi party samaajawaadee party par bhi in dinon wo nishaanaa saadh rahi he
 It is clear that in the wake of the upcoming by-elections and the 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati has tightened her back
 lakhanu main shanivaar ko yojit alpsankhyak jaagarukta sammelan mulaayam singh yadav ne alpsankhyako sambodhit karte huye kaha ki wo alpsankhyako ke har haq ke liye ladege
 Mulayam Singh Yadav asked the BJP to change its attitude towards Muslims and said that the Ayodhya issue will no longer run, he also said that about four hundred Muslim youth in Uttar Pradesh, who were forcibly jailed in the name of terrorism

 Mulayam Singh Yadav instructed the ministers of Uttar Pradesh government to come to the conference to implement the manifesto within two and a half years
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi sthit ek civil court ne saman jari kiya he
 The court has ordered Rahul Gandhi to present his case in the court
 court ke aadesh ke baad 3 july ko rahul gandhi ko court main pesh hona hoga
 Please tell that during the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had allegedly made objectionable remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 2 March
 rahul gandhi ne chunavi jansabha ke dauraan kaha tha ki sabhi modi bhrasht hai
 His statement was also severely criticized
 jaj vipul kumaar kii adaalat ne yah saman jari kiya he
 It is worth mentioning that earlier this year, the Ranchi court had issued summons against Rahul Gandhi on a complaint by BJP worker Naveen Kumar Jha
 us samay rahul gandhi ne dilli main yojit adhiveshan main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippanee kii thi
 Rahul had said that a assassin in BJP can become president, but it cannot happen in Congress
 rahul ke is bayaan par naveen jha ne kaha tha ki unke is bayaan se unhen thes pahunchi he, unke is bayaan se party kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 The bugle of assembly elections in Gujarat has been blown up on 1 October with Amit Shah's Gaurav Yatra
 2002 se 2014 tak gujarat main ladaa gaya har ek chunaav narendra modi ke netritv main ladaa gaya
 During this time, Lal Krishna Advani also played the role of the top leadership in the campaign
 lekin maujuuda raajnneeti main jari ghatnakram se saaf sanket mil rahaa he ki party ke andar laal krishna adwani ko jabaran ritair karne kii kavayad ho rahi he
 In 2014, he was elected from the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat of the state and became a member of the current Lok Sabha
 is seat se adwani lagaataar 24 saal se loksabhaa pahunch rahe hai, lekin ab na to loksabhaa kii is seat ko or na hi gujarat kii raajnneeti ko laal krishna adwani kii jarurat he
 It is a fact that in national politics, the credit of bringing BJP from two Lok Sabha seats to power is given to Lal Krishna Advani's 1990 Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya
 ise bhi padhein: mukhyamantriyon ko teen saal main kamjor kar majboot hue pradhanmantri modisutron kii maane to agle maheene hone vaale gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye laal krishna adwani ko party kii star prachaarkon kii suchi main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 On Sunday, the party's list of star campaigners for Himachal Pradesh elections was released and in this list also they have been kept free from any electoral responsibility of the state
 haalanki isse pehle hue uttar pradesh ke chunaavon ke liye bhi taiyaar hui star prachaarkon kii suchi se adwani kaa naam gaayab tha
 Now that Advani is not named in the list, it can be clearly understood that Lal Krishna Advani will not be given a ticket from Gandhinagar seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 ab gujarat chunaav ke liye party ke prachaar kii taiyaari par najar daalen
 For the first time since 2002, the Gaurav Yatra started from Karamsad, the birthplace of Sardar Patel under the leadership of Amit Shah, has to be taken to all the assembly seats in the state
 is yatra ke udghaatan ke baad pehle charan main ise 76 vidhansabha siton tak le jane kii jimmedaari up mukhyamantri nitin patel ko di gai
 The second leg of the yatra started from Porbandar on 2 October and its command was handed over to the state unit's party president Jitu Vaghani
 ise bhi padhein: 2019 kii siyaasi jang jeetne ke liye taiyaar ho rahaa he modi kaa apana 'manaregaa'donon hi charan kii in yatraaon ko jab ummid ke mutabik bheed nahin dikhaai di to party ne aanan-fanan main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko bataur star prachaarak is yatra ko safal banane kii jimmedaari di gai
 Here too, he was an MP from Gandhinagar for 2 decades and the party's top most leader Lal Krishna Advani was not included
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle yadi star prachaarkon kii suchi se adwani kaa naam baahar he to jaahir ek ki ek saal ke andar hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi unki gandhinagar se ummidavaari par sawaal khadaa kiya ja saktaa he
 It is possible that Advani, who has been marginalized inside the party after the 2014 victory, will not need the party in the next Lok Sabha elections
 aisa hota he to star pratarakon kii yah suchi laal krishna adwani ke political ritairement kii disha main pehla kadam he

 com / l2fbyalroh kendriya cabinet mantri nitin gadakari ke baad ab maharashtra sarkaar kekrishi mantri ekanath khadsene bhi paudhon or kheti ke liye mutr ke istemaal par jor diya he
 Khadse said that the state government is trying to make special fertilizer to increase the productivity of farming
 ek angreji akhbaar kii khabar ke mutabik khadse ne kaha, 'insaanon ke mutr ko kheti main istemaal karne se utpaadakta badhegi
 For this, there is also a plan to collect it from multiplexes and cinema houses urinals
 ' iske pehle kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki vah apane garden ke pedo ko behatar banane ke liye unamem apana mutr daalate hai
 They store their urine in a can of 50 liters for this
 kisaanon ko di jaaegi sabsidi!khadse ne kaha ki insaani mutr kheti ko zyada utpaadak banaata he
 It can be better used, especially in rural areas
 unhone kaha ki mumbai ke cinema gharon se mutr ekatrit kar use gramin ilaakon main bheja jayega, jiskaa istemaal kheton main hoga
 The state government has also started a new policy to woo farmers towards this scheme
 jo kisaan is yojana ke aadhaar par kheti karenge unhen sarkaar 35 fisadi sabsidi dene par vichaar kar rahi he
 With this money, farmers will collect cow dung and cow urine in addition to urine and make manure
 khadse ne kaha ki gadakari ke bayaan main kuch bhi galat nahin tha
 Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth has proved this in his study
 lagaataar bad rahimahangise aam aadmi ko raahat dilaane ke liye modi sarkaar ek pukhta vyavastha karne ja rahi he
 With this system, not only will inflation be curbed, but also the prices of vegetables and pulses can be controlled
 iske liye centre sarkaar ek automatic system laane kii yojana bana rahi he
 Through this, inflation will be controlled before it reaches the sky
 ye hogi nai vyavasthapichley kai maheenon se pyaaj, tamaato samet anyasubgiyonv daalon ke daam main lagaataar badhotaree ho rahi he
 This has also had an impact on retail inflation and wholesale inflation
 aniyantrit mahangaai ko ab modi sarkaar ek automatic system se kaabo karegi
 According to the Hindustan newspaper, the government will arrange for Common Standard Procedure (SOP) for this
 aise kaabo hogi mahangisamanya maanak prakriyaake tahat jaise hi kisi saamaan kaa daam ek seemaa se zyada bad jayega, vaise hi us par niyantran paane ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae jaaenge
 Through this, the government will be able to control the prices of fruits and vegetables before they increase wildly
 is prakriya ko puraa karne ke liye sarkaar kisaan or upabhoktaaon ke hiton ke bich samanvay banaaegi
 The PMO is in filereport, citing an official of the Consumer Ministry, who has said that the proposal for this new system is currently with the Prime Minister's Office
 yahaan se nikalne ke baad sambandhit mantralayon main ise bheja jayega
 It will be finalized after getting approval from all ministries
 aise karegaa kamsamanya maanak prakriya main mahangaai par kaabo paane ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya ko mul maanak mana jayega
 In such a situation, if the price of a commodity increases by 50 percent more than the MSP, then the government will immediately come into action
 is par niyantran karne ke liye sarkaar esaopi ke jariye fouran us utpaada ke niryaat par roak laga degi
 Tomato-onion prices should increase so that the prices of tomato have skyrocketed in the last few days
 pyaaj kaa bhi yahi haal tha
 In Delhi's retail mandis, the price of a kg of tomatoes reached 80 to 100 rupees per kg
 yahi nahin, anya subjiyon ke daam bhi aasmaan chune lage the
 Due to this, the pressure on the common man's pocket was increasing
 lagaataar bad rahe damatmatar or pyaaj kii keemten abhi bhi 50 rupee va usase zyada he
 Prices are constantly increasing
 pichley dinon dilli kii retail mandiyon main saamaanya tamaato 80 rupee prati kilo bik rahaa tha
 At the same time, people were paying up to 100 rupees for desi tomatoes
 subjiyon ke daam lagaataar badhate hi ja rahe hai
 Not only Delhi, Dehradun, Noida and other places are also seeing an increase in the prices of vegetables
 sarkaar kii ho chuki he aalochanalagataar bad rahi mahangaai ko lekar sarkaar kii aalochana bhi ho rahi thi
 Many people attributed the government's negligence to rising inflation
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha tha ki jald badhati keemten niyantrit ho jaaengi
 He informed that as tomato supply increases, prices will start to decline
 haalankikya kargar hogi nai vyavasthatmatar or pyaajki keemten badhane se philhal kuch raahat mili he, lekin nai vyavastha mahangaai par lagaam kasne main sabase zyada kargar sabit ho sakati he
 However, for this to be effective, common people may have to wait a long time
 kyonki abhi yah prastaav pradhanmantri karyaalay main hi he or uske baad ise alag-alag mantralayon se guzarana hoga
 The time it will take will be finalized after passing through all these ministries
 antim rup dene ke baad hi ise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 It is almost certain to take some time to implement this initiative by the government

 mere paas amitabh ji kaa driver aayaa or mujhe le gaya
 "" i asked, what happened brother? Hearing this, Amitabh said - what is this, the whole book

 Kader Khan said, i tell you

 But when the scene was over, he had tears in his eyes

 Hearing on the Nirbhaya case in Patiala House Court, due to the petition in Tilisupriam Court, the hearing has been filed by the accused Akshay, the hearing on the petition for issuing a death warrant against the convicts in the SC reconsideration or the gang rape case is still deferred in the Patiala House Court
 patiala house court kaa kahana he ki abhi ek yachika supreme court main listed he, aise main usee ke baad is par nirnay ho sakegaa
 This petition was filed in Patiala House Court on behalf of Nirbhaya's parents
 patiala house court main shuukravaar ko kya hua, puraa maamla samajhie
 
 
 Why the hearing could not be held today? In the Nirbhaya case, it was said by the Patiala House Court that because a petition related to this case has been filed in the Supreme Court, due to this, the hearing cannot be held yet
 supreme court main nirbhaya maamle main doshi akshay kumaar ne faansee ke faisle ke khilaaf punarvichaar yachika daayar kii he, isapar 17 disambar ko sunwaayee honi he
 Now after hearing the same case, there will be a hearing in Patiala House Court on December 18 at 2 pm
 nirbhaya ke maa-baap kii taraf se kareeb ek saal pehle patiala house court main ye yachika daayar kii gai thi ki doshiyon ke khilaaf jald se jald deth warrant jari kiya jaae, taaki faansee kii prakriya ko aage badhaayaa ja sake
 What did the family and the Delhi Police say? During the hearing in Patiala House Court on Friday, the lawyers of Nirbhaya's family, lawyers of Delhi Police, were asked to issue the death warrant immediately
 iske liye unhone yaqub menon cese kaa hawala diya, vakeelon ne tark diya ki us maamle main bhi deth warrant jari ho chukaa he
 It was argued on behalf of Delhi Police that the Patiala House Court has the right to issue a death warrant, if the convicts want to challenge it, they can go to the High Court
 haalanki, jaj ne sidhaa kaha ki vah supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge
 What did Nirbhaya's mother say? After the hearing was postponed on Friday, Nirbhaya's mother has said that she is satisfied with the hearing, but she will get peace only when those convicts are hanged on the gallows
 beete dinon jab hyderabad rape-hatya maamle main aropiyon ko police encounter main dher kar diya gaya tha, usee ke baad se hi desh main mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate atyaachaar par gussa bad rahaa he
 Significantly, in the Niribhaya gang rape case in 2012, four convicts were sentenced to death
 nirbhaya ke doshi akshay, pawan, vinay or mukesh abhi tihaad jail main band hai
 Now a lot of matches are to be played by Team India on the land of the subcontinent, where the pitches will be their choice

 The Modi government at the Center has termed the statement of the UP government minister and SP leader Azam Khan a complete nonsense in which Azam Khan claimed that Dawood Ibrahim was also present in PM Modi's meeting with Nawaz Sharif in Lahore
 sarkaar ke pravaktaa frank noronho ne bayaan jari kar kaha ki ye daawa bilkul aadharahin he
 Allegations totally unfounded, baseless & false: goi Spokesman Frank Noronha to ANI on Azam Khan's allegation -PM Modi met Dawood in Lahore- ANI (@ani_news) February 6, 2016 Gave the statement
 sapa ke diggaj netaa ne daawa kiya tha ki pakistan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke samakaksh navaj sharif kii baithak ke dauraan kamare main anderworld sargana daaud ibrahim bhi maujuud tha
 Not only this, the SP leader said that he also has convincing evidence
 ajam khangajipur main shanivaar ko nijee kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunche the
 During this, while speaking to the media at the local airport, he said, 'prime Minister Modi had also met Dawood Ibrahim in the same room in which the Prime Minister Narendra Modi met and interacted with Nawaz Sharif in Pakistan
 mere paas iske saboot maujuud hai
 "PAK comes to kebab, death here on eating meat", the SP leader further said, "we sent Pashmina shawls and Malihabadi mangoes to Nawaz Sharif, while silver kebabs came from Pakistan in silver cans
 ' ajam khan ne kaha ki padosi mulk se hamen seenk kebab bheja jaataa he, jabaki hamaare yahaan maance khaane ke naam par bhi musalmaan maare jate hai
 MLA from Rampur Nagar, Ajam Khan said that the worst government in the entire country is that of BJP ruled states
 rafel deal vivaad par ghiri hue centre kii modisarkaarake liye mushkilen kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 Earlier the opposition parties were attacking the issue, now BJP colleagues have also started targeting them
 shivasena ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne ravivaar korafelsaude ko ‘‘boforce kaa baap’’ qaraar diya or kaha ki is saude ke khilaaf baar-baar bolne se desh kii raajnneeti memrahul gandhika mahatv badha he
 In the party mouthpiece 'saamana', Raut said that those who accused Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's relative in the Bofors deal of taking a bribe of 65 crores are now in power
 ‘‘aaj un par rafel vimaan saude main 700 karod rupee kii ghoose lene kaa aarope he
 Rafael is the father of Bofors
 ’’saude par francwa oland ke daavon ko lekar bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hueshivsenasaansad ne hairaani jataai kii purv francisi raashtrapati ko congress adhyaksh kaa samarthak kaha jayega yaa ek ‘‘raashtra virdohi’’ qaraar diya jayega
 On September 21, a French media report quoted Hollande as saying that the Indian government had proposed Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation to be an offset partner to Reliance Defense in the Rs 58,000-crore deal and France had no option Was
 shivasena netaa ne kaha, ‘‘sawaal yah nahin he ki anil ambani ko yudhak vimaan banane kaa anubandh diya gaya balki prayek vimaan ke liye 527 karod rupee ke mulya ke bajaae modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main yah sauda 1570 karod rupee main kiya gaya
 This means the middleman got a brokerage of about Rs 1,000 crore per aircraft
 ’’raut ne bhaajapa ke un aaropon ko haasyaaspad qaraar diya ki saude ko lekar gandhi dwaara kii ja rahi aalochana ‘‘pakistan kii bhashaa bolne or uski madad’’ karne sareekha he
 "the same allegations were leveled against the Congress during the Bofors deal (in the late 1980s)," he said
 kya tab isse pakistan kii madad nahin ho rahi thi? jo satta main hai ve boforce ko ek ghotaalaa maanate hai
 
 
 However they are not willing to believe that Rafael is also a scam
 ’’rajyasabha saansad ne kaha, ‘‘desh main sirf rahul gandhi rafel qaraar ke khilaaf bol rahe he, jabaki baaki sabhi raajnneetik dal khamosh hai
 That is why Rahul is now gaining more importance in the politics of the country
 congress ne kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan ke istife kii maang kii he
 This question has arisen when a 2013 income tax report came out of a news report from NDTV which showed that a mining industrialist arrested in the Vyapam scam had to pay for the visits of the current Union Minister
 congress ke netaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki dharmedra pradhan ko istipha de dena chahie or agar vah aisa nahin karte to pradhanmantri ko turant unka istipha maang lenaa chahie
 Not only this, Surjewala also reiterated the demand of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan to step down
 surajevaala ke mutabik yahi ek tarika he jisase us ghotaale kii nishpaksh jaanch ho sakati he jisamen ab tak 49 logon kii jaan ja chuki he
 It is worth noting that the NDTV report today spoke of a document, according to which there was a direct transaction of money between the millionaire Sudhir Sharma and some senior politicians arrested in the Vyapam case
 is maamle par dharmendra pradhan (jo us vakt kendriya mantri nahin the) ne enditivi se kaha "ye sirf ek taraf kii baat kahi gai he
 My ticket has always been booked by the party office
 " pradhan ne saaf kiya he ki sudhir sharma se unka koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The comments ye inkam tex report, un dastavejon main shaamil he jo sudhir sharma samet kai rajanetaaon ke gharon par chaape padane ke dauraan mili hai
 Congress MLA Veer Singh Bhuria is also named in it
 surajevaala kaa kahana he ki 2011 main sudhir sharma ke ghar par pade chaape ke baad bani ye report kahin naa kahin dikhaati he ki vyaapman ghotaale se mili paise kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Not only this, the Congress leader has also accused the Chief Minister of lying to the Madhya Pradesh Assembly and the people of the state
 bhaajapa netaa shaayna en si ne enditivi se kaha he ki kisi ko bachaane kii koshish nahin kii ja rahi he
 Anyway, relying on any one report is better than waiting for a CBI inquiry

 On this matter, Dharmendra Pradhan (who was not a Union Minister at the time) told NDTV "this is only an aside
" meri tikat hameshaa se party offis hi book karwaati ai he
 "pradhan has made it clear that he has nothing to do with Sudhir Sharma

 isamen congress vidhayak vir singh bhuriya kaa bhi naam he
 Surjewala says that this report, made after the raid on Sudhir Sharma's house in 2011, somewhere shows that the money from the Vyapam scam has been used

 Farmers started a padyatra by opening a front against the administration's land acquisition for the proposed industrial project in Madhya Pradesh

 Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad said on Tuesday that he stood by his statement on Kashmir
 vah apane man kii baat bolte hai or isse palatate evam badalte nahin hai
 His response comes days after India objected to his statement on Kashmir
 bataa den, pichley maheene sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main kashmir mudde ko uthaate hue mahatir ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bharat ne jammu-kashmir par ‘akraman karke kabja' kiya he
 He had said that India should work with Pakistan to resolve the issue
 haalanki bharat ke videsh mantralay ne mahatir ke bayaan par kadi pratikriya jataai thi
 Now Mahathir Mohammed said during the press conference in Parliament, 'we have realized that the people of Kashmir had benefited from the UN resolution and we are all saying that not only India and Pakistan but also America and other countries Should also follow it
 ' unhone kaha, ‘ham apane man kii baat bolte hai or ham isse palatate or badalte nahin hai
 'indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said earlier this month that India and Malaysia have traditionally enjoyed a good and friendly relationship and' we regret these comments as they are not based on facts
 'mahatir mohammad ne kaha, ‘kabhi-kabhi hamaare tanaavpurn sambandh rahe, lekin ham logon ke saath dostana vyavhaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Malaysia is a trading nation
 hamen bazaaron kii aavashyaktaa he or isliye ham logon ke liye achche hai

 Further, on the Indian business association's call not to buy palm oil from Malaysia, Mahathir said that the government was studying the effects of their boycott

 Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra raised the issue during zero hour and said that due to lack of proper storage facilities in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, wheat is rotting on a large scale
 unhone kaha ki kendriya krishi mantri ne aashwaasan diya tha ki nijee bhandaaran sahit anaaj ke bhandaaran ke samuchit prabandh kiye jaayenge, lekin adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee or rajanetaaon kii niyat ke kaaran jamaakhoron kii ban aayi he or vah oonche daam par gehun or chaaval bech rahe hai
 Mishra said that the matter has reached such an extent that even the Supreme Court has made serious remarks in this matter
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha ki yadi anaaj kaa sahi bhandaaran nahin ho paa rahaa he to use garibon main muft baant diya janaa chaiye
 The BJP leader demanded that the Union Agriculture Minister should inform the country about the entire matter through Parliament

 Javadekar said that the government has not made any efforts towards increasing the production of fertilizer
 na to urvarak ke band kaarkaanon ko kholane kaa prayaas kiya gaya or na hi is kshetra main koi nayaa nivesh kiya gaya
 He alleged that the Union Chemical and Fertilizer Minister and the Union Agriculture Minister were not taking any interest in the matter

 buudhvaar ko north emsidi kii sthai samiti kii baithak main dengue ke masale par vipaksh ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 According to the opposition, the corporation is hiding the figure of dengue deaths
 vipaksh ne saboot ke taur par baqayda ek deth certificate bhi pesh kiya gaya jisaki exclusive copy dilli ajtak ke paas he
 Dengue is spreading rapidly in the capital
 magar is masale par nigam ne jo aankade abtak muhaiyaa karaae hai uske mutabik dilli main dengue ke abtak 255 maamle saamne aae hai or isamen abtak kisi bhi shaks kii maut nahin hui he

 mrityu praaanpatr main saaf taur par santosh naam kii mahila kii maut kii vajah dengue ko bataaya gaya he
 Leader of Opposition in North MCD, Mukesh Goyal said that the BJP is misleading the people of Delhi regarding dengue
 haalanki deth certificate saamne aane par sthai samiti ke adhyaksh ko bhi maananaa padaa ki dilli main dengue se maut hui he jiskaa aankada nigam ke paas nahin he
 The highest number of dengue cases has been reported from Delhi in the North MCD
 lekin khatra aage chalakar or bad saktaa he
 Because the MCD itself believes that it has a very low stock of medicines used for the prevention of dengue
 dawaaiyon kii kami se saaf he ki aane vaale dinon main dilli ko dengue ke dank se or zyada satark rahane kii jarurat he
 The MCD is given data on dengue patients every week
 emsidi ke aankadon ke mutabik dengue ke marij to bad rahe hai lekin uske aankadon main abhi tak kisi kii maut kii pushti nahin kii gai
 In such a situation, the big question is whether the death toll is not being reached with the MCD or is it deliberately hiding the death toll

 The postmortem report on Wednesday revealed some spot marks on the body, but the murder was not confirmed
 haalanki, namrata chandani ke parivaar ne is postmortem report ko maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 The family claims that Namrata's murder was not a suicide
 namrata ke bhai vishaal chandani kaa kahana he ki maine apni bahan kaa shav dekha tha, sabhi saboot is baat kii ore ishaara karte hai ki ye ek hatya he naa ki koi suicide
 Explain that Vishal Chandani is also a Medical Consultant in the Medical College of Karachi
 bataa den ki postmortem report saamne aane ke baad doctoron ne daawa kiya tha ki namrata chandani ne dupattey se faansee lagaai thi
 But Vishal says that the scars found on Namrata's neck do not prove that he had committed suicide
 namrata ke bhai vishaal kaa daawa he ki wo nishaan ek cabel ke hai, iske alaava namrata ke haathon par jakhm ke bhi nishaan the
 Who point out that he was coerced

 ek aarthik samachar patr ne khabar di he ki fifa world cap main istemaal kiya jane vaale footbal kii supplai kaa order pakistan ko mila or usne uski supplai bhi kar di
 According to the letter, Pakistan has also won the supply of football to European countries
 in deshon main footbal bade paimaane par khelaa jaataa he or uske liye ball ke bade order aate hai
 Football is made in Jalandhar, India, while in Sialkot, Pakistan
 lekin jalandhar ke kaarobaari chook gaye or world cap ke liye brazuka ball banane kaa kaam sialkot kii companiyon ko mil gaya
 That too when the machine-making ball in Pakistan has recently started
 samajha jaataa he ki world cap sijan ke liye pakistan ko 6 karod footbal bhejne kaa order mila he
 China has gained a tremendous edge in making football
 usne isamen bhi bharat ko haraa diya tha lekin vahaan mazdooree badhane se ye ball mahange hone lage or bharat ko phir se order milane lage
 But this time our producer missed the chance

 China showed inability to make too many balls in a short period of time
 jab tak bhartiya nirmaataa kuch karte, pakistan kii company forward sports ne adidas ko aashwast kar diya ki vah unke liye ball supplai kar sakati he
 He also sought modern machinery to make these balls and started making balls in Sialkot
 jalandhar main bade paimaane par footbal banate hai or footbal khilne vaale bade desh jaise france, euke, uese vagairah sabhi jagah vahaan ke ball jate hai or unke paas order bhi hai
 But their problem is that they lack people working in low wages
 iske alaava trand lebar kaa bhi abhaav he
 Not only this, there is also a shortage of cheap raw materials in India
 sarkari mashinari bhi behad sust he
 Obviously, football cannot be made here at that speed
 bhartiya nirmaataaon kaa kahana he ki yahaan samasyaayein bahut hai or isliye jaldbaaji main die order ham nahin le pate kyonki hamaare paas iske liye aadharbhoot suvidhaayen nahin hai
 India should be satisfied with the fact that these football bladders are exported from India and they are used in the ball used in the World Cup
 yahaan se hi ye pakistan bhi jate hai

 India has recognized its problems
 sari samasyaon kaa ek hi naam he, nehru
 There is no such problem in India which is not rooted in Nehru
 agar nehru nahin hai to vah samasya nahin hai
 He is the first leader in the world who has created so many problems on his own
 trephic signal par gaay dikh jaae, aapako kahana chahie ki nehru doshi hai
 Harvard people should do hardwork in research whether there is any problem for which Nehru is innocent
 doshi nahin hai
 Whoever will find such a problem for which Nehru is not responsible, then i will give him coconut with my expenses, which will be called Nehru coconut
 raajnneeti ke ramgarh main nehru funs gaye hai

 2014 ke baad public dibet main nehru ne aisi vaapasi kii he jaise kabhi kisi jamaane main do teen saal ke gap ke baad achaanak anshuman gaekwad kii team india main vaapasi ho jaati thi
 If China did not declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, then Nehru's name also figured in it
 china se koi gussa nahin
 The Chinese defender did not say anything but Ravi Shankar Prasad called Nehru responsible
 arun jetali ne to apane twit main kya nahin kaha
 Jaitley said so much by tweeting that it happened by mistake of your grandfather
 bharat aapke parivaar kii galatiyon ko durust kar rahaa he
 The same person is responsible for both Kashmir and China
 mujhe laga tha ki whatsap uniwarsity main nehru kaa sara silebus puraa ho gaya he
 But the Chinese angle market saw a new beginning
 ravishankar prasad ne hindu akhbaar main chape shashi tharur kii kitaab par ek lekh kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki nehru ne sanyukt raashtra ke suraksha parishad kii seat china ko de di
 Shashi Tharoor has to tweet seven to deny
 tharur ne kaha ki china to 1945 se hi suraksha parishad kaa sadsy tha
 In 1949, when Mao Tse Tung's Communist government was formed, Chang Kai-shek moved to Taiwan, which was recognized as an exile government
 yah sarkaar khud ko republic of china kahati thi
 Nehru wondered how the small island could be made a member of the Security Council
 nehru ne anya sthaayee sadasyon se kaha ki communiston ke prabhaav vaale china ko shaamil kiya jaae
 America refused and asked India to subscribe
 nehru ko laga ki yah galat hoga
 There will be another injustice with China
 bharat apane dam par ek din sthaayee sadsyta legaa
 Tharoor wrote that anyway India could not replace China and become a member until the UN Charter could change
 or america pahal karata bhi to rus vito kar detaa
 It is therefore incorrect to say that Nehru gifted permanent membership of the Security Council to China
 1945 se 1971 tak republic of china suraksha parishad kaa sadsy tha
 He became a member of the People's Republic of China Security Council after 1971
 tab tak nehru kaa nidhan ho chukaa tha
 BBC Hindi has published an article on this
 is lekh main 27 sitambar 1955 ko sansad main die gaye nehru ke bayaan kaa hawala he jise main pard rahaa hum
 On this day Nehru replies that 'no proposal was received formally or informally to become a permanent member of the Security Council in the UN
 kuch sandigdh sandarbhon kaa hawala diya ja rahaa he jisamen koi sachai nahin he
 The Security Council at the United Nations was formed under the UN Charter and had permanent membership of certain countries
 charter main bina sanshodhan ke koi badlaav yaa koi nayaa sadsy nahin ban saktaa
 In such a situation, there is no question that India was given a seat and India refused to take the seat
 hamaari ghoshit niti he ki sanyukt raashtra main sadsy bane ke liye jo bhi desh yogya hai un sabko shaamil kiya jaae
 Apart from Ravi Shankar Prasad, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his tweet quoted a letter from Nehru to the Chief Ministers on 2 August 1955
 bijepi ne bhi 2 agast 1955 ke patr kaa hawala diya jisamen unke anusaar likhaa hua tha, 'anaupchaarik rup se america ne raay di thi ki china ko sanyukt raashtra main liya jaae magar suraksha parishad main nahin or bharat ko china kii jagah liya janaa chahie
 We cannot accept this because relations with China will be affected and it will be an injustice to a great country like China not to remain on the Security Council
 'kya vaaki nehru ne aisa kaha tha
 We saw this paper in the Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru Second Series Volume 29, page number 439, 440, 441
 salected works of jawaharlal nehru ke saare patron or lekhon ko chapa gaya he
 Part One has 14 volumes

 It is a long letter
 iske para 3 main nehru likhte hai ki jiniva main america or china ke rajdoot kii mulaakaat donon deshon ke sambandhon kii disha main choti shuruuaat he, phir bhi mahatvapurn he
 The release of American airmen imprisoned in China will improve relations significantly
 pradhanmantri chau en laai kaa bhaashan bhi naram tha
 In this letter, there is nothing about the UN Security Council
 to phir jetali kis patr kaa hawala de rahe hai
 The government has often said that India should be made a member of the Security Council
 kya sarkaar ne kabhi nehru ko mili prastaav kaa hawala diya he, is bare main vitt mantri na sahi to kam se kam krishi mantri to bataa hi sakate hai
 Nehru was made president of the Congress in 1929 at the Lahore Congress when he was just 40 years old

 Gandhi introduces Nehru to the Lahore Congress and says that he is undoubtedly an extremist
 jo apane vakt se kahin aage kii sochate hai
 But he is so humble and practical that he does not speed up so much that things break
 vah sphatik kii tarah shuddh hai
 His integrity is beyond doubt
 jo bhay or ninda se pare he
 The nation is safe in their hands
 azaadi kii ladaai main nehru 9 baar jail gaye
 3259 days are spent in jail
 9veen baar jab jail gaye to 1051 din tak band rahe
 This means he was continuously imprisoned for three years
 aaj kal ke netaaon kii antair degree kaa pataa nahin chalata magar nehru ne kareeb 550 pannon kii kitaab likhi thi, discovery of india

 nehru kii viraasat ko mitaa dene kaa sukh kise mil rahaa he or kis keemat par mil rahaa he, ise samajhane kaa vakt kahaan he
 a fact has also come up in this debate that Vajpayee also made a mistake by signing treaties with China on Tibet

 The Election Commission has claimed that VVPAT along with EVM will be used at all booths throughout Delhi during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 dilli ke chif elactoral officer ranbir singh ne is abhiyaan ko launch karte hue kaha ki zyaadaatar logon ko iviem ke bare main jaankaree he, lekin VVPAT ke bare main nahin
 It is very important for every voter to know VVPAT

 is dauraan parche baantkar EVM se jude har sawaal or andeh ko dur karne kii koshish hogi
 What will be done to protect the evms used for machine awareness campaigns, how to protect them from tampering? In response to this question of 'aaj Tak', the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi replied that the rules of the Election Commission will be followed
 EVM ko raat ke vakt kisi privet jagah par nahin balki police suraksha ke bich sarkari santhaan main rakhi jaaegi
 a political party alleges that votes are being cut in Delhi? In response to this question, Ranbir Singh said that such complaints were investigated and the facts were also shared with the political party

 Therefore it is not possible to tamper with EVM and tamper with the result

 Controversy in the most powerful Yadav family of UP is also a topic of discussion in national politics at this time
 rajya ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav apane chachaa shivpal singh ke khilaaf khulkar saamne aa gaye hai
 In this arrogance, Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal is in favor of CM Akhilesh, while the SP supremo has raised his voice in favor of brother Shivpal Yadav
 upree taur par yah vivaad bhale hi yadav parivaar kii andruni ladaai mana ja rahaa ho, lekin iske centre bindu 60 saal ke amar singh hai
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav is openly opposing Amar Singh's return to the party, while Mulayam and Shivpal have stood by him
 (padhein, mulaayam ke kehane se gale mili akhilesh or shivpal, iske baad chachaa-bhatija phir bhide) Actually, the personality of Amar Singh is like this
 raajnneeti main bhale hi vivaadon se ghire rahe hon lekin unki aprihaaryta hameshaa bani rahi
 Amar Singh's opponents consider him to be a very ambitious and a conspirator, while his supporters call him an expert in fund razors and crisis management
 shaayad yahi kaaran rahaa ki siem akhilesh yadav or party ke pramukh muslim chehre maane jane vaale ajam khan ke purajor virodh ke baavjood amar singh kii party main na sirf sasamman vaapasi hui balki unhen rashtriya mahasachiv pad se navaj diya gaya
 It is said of businessman Amar Singh that his relations are in all parties, due to which he emerges as a 'troubleshooter'
 (upi main ghamaasan : sapa baithak main bole shivpal yadav- bete kii kasam, akhilesh ne kaha tha alag party banaaenge) Due to his utility, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav said in Monday's meeting that i cannot leave Amar Singh
 ' sapa pramukh ne kaha, 'amar singh mere bhai hai
 Born in a Rajput family, Amar Singh was expelled from the party in 2010 along with his special aide Jayaprada
 sapa se nikaale jane ke baad amar singh ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan rashtriya lokdal ke saath haath mila liya or fatehpur sikri se chunaav bhi ladaa lekin haar gaye
 However, even after staying out of the SP, neither Mulayam, Amar Singh nor Amar Singh could forget the SP supremo
 upi main vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle ve party main vaapasi karne main kaamyaab rahe
 The comments amar singh ko mulaayam kaa kaaphi vishwaas hasil he
 When the Communist Party of India withdrew its support due to the UPA government's proposed nuclear deal with the US in 2008 and the government came into a minority
 kaha jaataa he ki us samay amar singh ne hi mulaayam singh yadav ko samarthan dene ke liye raji kiya tha
 The credit of bringing corporate culture to the Samajwadi Party also goes to Amar Singh, although he was also the target of opponents for this
 paise, bollywood or desh ke taqatvar hastiyon tak apni pahunch ke liye mashhoor amar singh sapa kii ore se kai baar rajyasabha sadsy rah chuke hai
 He has been a member of several committees of Parliament
 (padhein, akhilesh yadav hue bhavuk, bole - netaa ji kehete to istifa de detaa, party main meraa kuch nahin) Along with this, his name has also come up in controversies
 isamen upie sarkaar ke paksh main vot dene ke liye 3 bijepi saansadon ko kathith taur par rishwat kii peshkash karne kaa maamla pramukh he
 An audio tape also came against him, claiming that it contained Amar Singh's voice
 amar singh ek samay bollywood ke super star amitabh bachchan ke bhi khaas sahyogi rah chuke hai lekin vakt ke saath unke sambandhon main khatas aati gai
 Mulayam's openness in favor of Amar Singh in the SP meeting has disappointed all the opponents including Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav at the moment

 Bumrah's success, Rajbumrah said, 'when i made my first-class debut, my first spell was ten overs
 main ranjai trophy main hameshaa adhik se adhik over karata rahaa or jisase mujhe madad mili

 Bumrah took five wickets in an innings in Test cricket for the second time
 isse bharat kaa siries main 0-2 kii haar se ubarkar vaapasi kaa rasta saaf ho gaya
 Test cricket is different from limited overs, Bumrah said, "you don't get anything easily

 The hard work we do other than the camera, we get results in such days

 There you deftly defuse the batsman and here in restraint and consistency everything is there in Test cricket
 meraa dhyaan isi par tha
 "big blow to England," said Bairstow's finger injury, Bumrah said, "I always concentrate on bowling with good length and challenge the batsman with good length

 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ke mutabik puraani dilli, karol baag, chhatarpur, devli, model toun, moujpur, pahadganj jaise ilaake main pani aa hi nahin rahaa he
 And the water that is coming is dirty

 There is a shortage of 230 MGD water here
 dilli main 37 lakh logon ko pani nahin mil paa rahaa he
 According to Manoj Tiwari, the BJP has promised that within four years after the government comes to Delhi, it will give clean water to the people of Delhi

 After the government comes to Delhi, we will give water to Delhiites

 is hafte singapore main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi duniya kii vittiya takneekee (fintech) companiyon ko bharat main aane kaa nyotaa de rahe the tab bharat main mobile, banking, beemaa, mutual fund kaa bazaar 'aadhaar' khisakane ke jatke se ubarne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Following the Supreme Court's decision on Aadhaar, many services have been beset with the confusion of customer identification
 vittiya seva udyog apane dard ko jiesti ke saath saajha kar saktaa he lekin sarkaar or bazaar, donon ke phaaydon kii surat nahin dikh rahi he
 The GST people can share their frustration with the concerns of Rafael or the Air Force where a very sensitive need for defense is embroiled in a controversy over the government and the country's credibility
 aadhaar, jiesti or rafel main gaharaa rishta he
 Their roles are different but their similarities and trouble are uniquely similar
 isse koun asahmat hoga ki teenon hi faisle yaa prastaav desh ke liye jaruri the
 The economy needs a scientific, biometric-based mass-identification system
 jiesti ko lagu kiya hi janaa tha or vaayu sena kaa aadhunikeekaran arse se lambit tha
 Interestingly, the previous government had decided them or the land was ready to implement them
 in teenon faislon ko nai yani modi sarkaar ne hathohath liya tha yani ki teenon faislon par, siddhanthata, ek kism kii rajnatik sahmati thi
 But what happened was that all three became the cause of confusion, controversy and politics rather than necessary reforms
 darasal, bhartiya loktantr is samay kuch apratyaashit museebaton se rubaru he
 Here reforms are not failing now because they have political differences or the common people are not with these decisions or the country does not have the ability to change itself
 
 
 asafalataa kii vajah ab yah he ki achche sudhaar isliye musiibat ban rahe hai kyonki sarkaar uchit loktantric prakriya kii andekhi kar rahi he
 Welfare from Dambha is also fatal and the same has happened with Aadhaar, GST and Rafael
 masalan aadhaar ko len
 
 
 It was agreed nearly a decade ago that India would have to adopt a biometric identification system to prevent loot in the sharing of government welfare resources
 upie se endie tak aate-aate aadhaar kii sankalpana par bahes khatm ho chuki thi, nitigat sawaal yah tha ki bharat main naagarikta kii pahchaan ko aadhaar se joda jaae yaa ise sirf sarkari skiimon ke labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan tak simit rakhaa jaae? is sawaal ke uttar main un sabhi ulajhanon ke jawaab chhipe the jinke kaaran aadhaar vivaadit hua
 Democracy advocated that the government formulate policy after dialogue on it and it would be implemented easily, but the government's insistence on righting itself increased so much that it was first implemented ad hoc and then on the basis of Supreme Court pressure The Bill of Law was approved by the Parliament by making a money bill
 aadhaar kaa faisla (sankalpana nahin) loktantr ke paimaanon par khara nahin tha isliye baari kharch par khadaa hua aadhaar, supreme court main khet rahaa
 Now the old anarchy returned with identity proofs
 aadhaar se judye ke baad ab isse alag hone kii muhim chal rahi he
 The cost of customer identification has increased for mobile, bank and financial services companies
 dhokhadhadi ke khatre gai guna bad gaye hai
 In the same way, GST also got bogged down in stubbornness and prejudice
 ek aisa sudhaar jisase jidipi badaae, laagat ghatane or tex chori rukne kii ummid thi uski taiyaari kharaab thi or badlaav par badlaav isliye hue kyonki unke saath koi sahmati nahin banaai gai jin par ise lagu kiya janaa tha
 GST is not implemented as poorly as anywhere else in India
 jiesti or aadhaar to nae faisle the lekin raksha kharid main vivaadon ke tajurbe ke baavjood, rafel main paardarshita ke liye un prakriyaaon kaa paalan nahin hua jinke jariye ise vivaadon se bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 Government affidavits in the Supreme Court are stating that in the Rafale judgment, rules like cabinet committees or sovereign guarantees have been ignored
 gandhi kii ek buniyadi baat ab sarkarein aksar bhuulane lagi hai: achche lakshya ke liye sadhano kii
 Purity is also necessary
 sarkaron ko samajhnaa padegaa ki koi bhi sudhaar agar loktantric prakriya se nahin nikalataa to sakriy loktantron main uske samasya banane ke khatre bad jate hai
 Purity of means is also necessary for good goals

 The conversation is a good start and it gave me hope for Assam and the north-east

 Singh said that Indian society has a long tradition of stamina and secularism and the country has always been ready to adopt new ways of thinking and living
 singh ne kaha, ‘hamaare bahudharmik or bahusaanskrithik samaaj ko paribhaashit karne vaale udaar drushtikon ko poshit or majboot karne kii jarurat he
 Inaugurating the Rs 1600 crore Guwahati Water Supply Project in Guwahati, Singh hoped that the project would benefit more and more people of Guwahati
 iske alaava unhone agle 20 saalon main shahari aadharbhoot sanrachanaon ko badaye jane kii baat par jor diya or kaha ki jawaharlal nehru shahari navinikaran mishan ke tahat sarkaar majboot nivesh ko badhaava de rahi he

 Idi has come as Tubelight this time from Salman Khan
 lekin is baar bhai kuch zyada hi imotional ho gaye hai
 His acting is right
 vaise bhi salmaan khan kii filmein dekhne ke liye rivyuu kii jarurat nahin he
 One has to see the records of the bus collection
 lekin salmaan se hatakar tubalite main kya he- is bare main jarur baat honi chahie
 Then salman-katrina duo will be seen in the sequel of Tiger Zinda Hai, where you can learn about these in 7 points - first thing is Om Puri
 tubalite main om puri shuruyaat se lekar aakhir tak najar aate hai
 His role as an uncle teaches Gandhigiri the character of Salman
 unki aawaaj or damdaar screen pregence is baat kaa ehsaas nahin dilaati ki ab vah hamaare bich nahin hai
 However, when we remember this, it is understandable that what we lost as Om Puri
 - sohail khan bhi is film main bhai ke saath hai
 After a long time, he has appeared on screen and it seems that his distance from the screen is also right
 haalanki bhaaiyon kaa bromance film ke shuruaati seen baandhakar kar rakhata he lekin isse zyada sohail ke role ke bare main baat unke saath jyaadati hi hogi
 - Salman Khan's naive antics attract more than the work of Matin Re Tangu
 ji, tubalite kaa 'chini baccha'
 She can be called the best child actor to be seen with Salman so far
 sharaarat ho yaa imoshan, matin kii tubalite har frem main jami he
 - Joo Joo's glam factor in plain style is also a great aspect of Tubelight
 china kii is abhinetri ke parde par aane par aap unase najar nahin hataa sakenge
 Be it the scene of slapping Zeeshan Ayub or comforting Salman, looking at Joo Joo, he feels that he should get more chances in Bollywood
 agar vah dance acha kar gayi to hamaare liye katrina caff kaa acha vikalp ho sakati hai!tubalite ko dekh cilebs ne aise kiya riect, dekhen TWEETS- vahiin maaya ke role ke baad isha talwaar bhi tubalite se chamak sakati hai
 His plane-gen avatar featured a special attraction
 bataa den ki isha malayalam filmon kii hit actress hai or kai bade brands ke vigyapanon main tivi par khub najar aati hai
 His experience is clearly visible in the film as well as the possibility of him moving forward in Bollywood
 - kabir khan ne ek baar phir sabit kiya he ki vah parde par international imoshans dikhaane ke master hai
 He has done the chemistry of Salman, Matin and Juju
 vahiin film main unhone bhale hi bajrangi bhaijan main pakistan kii tarah china nahin dikhaaya, lekin jang or aman kaa antar behtareen tareeke se pesh kiya he
 Film Review: The emotional drama is Salman's 'tubelight' - Apart from this, Shah Rukh Khan's appearance is also good
 haalanki jaadugar pasha ke role main unke luk se zyada dialog prabhavit karte hai or khud par yakeen rakhane kii baat sahi bhi he
 Just as Salman Khan is confident of how the film gets a rating, it will earn a record breaking release on Eid! Also, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, Garhwal's beautiful hills and Chinese army locust attack tactics 
 
 
 ye sabhi tubalite ko salmaan factor se hatakar or chamakaate hi hai!tubalite se shahrukh kii tasviren li, jaadugar ke role main aae najar With whom the wires of Ashok Jadeja, which defrauded the public by misleading the rupee, are connected to whom, it is gradually being revealed
 pehle ye pataa chalaa ki bollywood actress mahima choudhary ne jadeja ke naam par vot maange the or ab abhinayta kiran kumaar se bhi is masale main poochtacha hone vaali he
 Gujarat CID is about to interrogate the film actor Kiran Kumar on the issue of Jadeja
 jadeja ne bataaya he ki usne kiran kumaar ko gujarati film banane ke liye paanch karod rupye die the
 However, Kiran Kumar completely denies this
 ahmedabad main chhaaraa samudaay ke log kaaphi taadaad main based hue hai
 And before the real face of Mahathg Ashok Jadeja was revealed, he was the incarnation of Kuldevi Vahanvati Shikotar Mata of the Chara community
 ek aisa shaks jis par shikotar mata kii aseem krupa thi or wo unke aashirwad se paison ko teen maheene main teen guna kar saktaa tha
 Mahima, who came to mobilize votes for the Congress candidate, tried to woo Ashok Jadeja's devotees by repeatedly saying Jai Maadi
 ashok jadeja ne elaan kar rakhaa tha ki shikotar mata ne use chhaaraa samudaay ke logon ke kalyaan ke liye hi bheja he
 Before the expose of Jadeja's demeanor, the people of the Chara community had such tremendous faith in Ashok Jadeja that shouting his name was a guarantee of vote for the candidates and Mahima Chaudhary did the same
 pataa nahin is thagraj ke or kitne or kis had tak conection hai

 When the role was offered to Karan, he responded in two words, "no, thanks

 So many actors were denied this role that the producers almost made up their mind to hide the gay aspect during the audition
