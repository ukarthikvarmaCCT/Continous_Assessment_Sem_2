 ek taraf karodon main khelanevaale asaram or unke bete narayan sai or duusari taraf footpath par jindagi gujaarta ek insaan
 On one hand, Asaram, who teaches the world of virtue and love, and on the other side, a man begging people in the struggle to stay alive
 lekin har roj jameen bicha kar aasmaan ko odhanevaale isi shaks ke seene main asaram or narayan sai ke wo raaj dafan hai, jo shaayad is duniya main in teenon ke alaava or koi nahin jaanata
 Now you will ask what kind of relationship Asaram can have with this poor begging on the sidewalk who knows Asaram and Narayan Sai so closely
 darasal, muflisi main jeene vaala yah shaks or koi nahin, balki khud asaram kaa sagaa bhatija vinod sirumalani he
 Nephew, son of Jetharam Sirumalani, Asaram's immediate elder brother
 vinod sirumalani
 But now the question is, how can the condition of the nephew of such a big and rich person be such that he has to beg people to live? So, in the answer to this question also, the reality of Asaram is hidden, after knowing that anyone will be embarrassed
 is shaks kii baton par yakeen karen to uskaa parivaar kabhi lakhon main khelaa karata tha or unki jindagi bhi acchhee khaasi thi, lekin ye asaram hi hai, jinhone iske puure parivaar ko sadak par laa diya
 Asaram fraudulently grabbed his own elder brother's property and before he could recover, his entire family came on the road
 yahi vajah rahi ki asaram ke bade bhai ne apni maut se pehle khud apane is bete se asaram ko kabhi maaf nahin karne kii baat kahi thi lekin takadir or tikadamon ke sahare asaram ne naa sirf sabko khamosh kar diya, balki unka apana sagaa bhatija hi sadakon par aa gaya
 Asaram's nephew Vinod Sirumalani, who was living on the sidewalk, once had a full-fledged family
 usne apni pasand kii ek ladki se lav marij bhi kii thi or pyaar kii nishaani ke taur par apni baanh par apana or apni patni kaa naam bhi gudwa liya tha lekin khud apane hi chachaa asaram kii surat main vinod kii taqadir usase kuch aisi ruthi ki wo jite-ji kahin kaa nahin rahaa
 Her father was killed, the house was snatched and wife went to Asaram
 ji haa, usee asaram ke paas, jo kehane ko to vinod kaa chachaa tha, lekin vinod kii maane to usee chachaa ne uski patni komal ko aisi pattee padhai ki wo phir laut kar kabhi nahin ai
 If Vinod is to be believed, Asaram's hypnosis has such a lore that when the girls look at him, then he becomes obsessed with them and his wife also became the victim of Asaram's secret lore
 vinod kahata he ki aaj uski patni kahaan he, wo nahin jaanata lekin wo aaj bhi usase beintehaa pyaar karata he
 However, these eyes of Vinod did not just see the ruin of himself and his family
 asaram ke saath-saath narayan sai kii wo karatootein bhi dekhin, jise sun kar kisi ke liye apane kaanon par bhi yakeen karnaa mushkil ho jaae
 Vinod says that Narayan Sai is very fond of taking off clothes of people and even tried to undress himself once Narayan's childhood
 vinod kii jindagi ab beshak in tukdon main simati ho, lekin isaki ankhon ne asaram or narayan sai kaa jo sach dekha he, wo chaunkaanewaala he
 Vinod not only saw his wife going to Asaram, but also during his stay at Asaram's ashram, he saw many more girls falling prey to Asaram
 zaahir he, vinod kii ye ankhon dekhi asaram ke khilaaf bolanewaali duusari tamaam ladakiyon or puraane saadhakon kii shikayaton se mail khaati hai or chunki vinod khud asaram kaa sagaa bhatija he, uski baton kaa vajan kahin or bhi zyaada he

 kya angreji ke 'engendered' shabd kaa aashay sahaj rup se angreji main hi 'gender Equality' se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In the essay paper of the UPSC Civil Services Mains Exam held recently, students of English and Hindi were surprised by a similar question in English
 hindi ke anuwaad kaa arth ekadam se ulat hone se chaatro ke dimag chakra gaye
 They did not understand what the correct answer was
 darasal niabandh paper ke khand e main pehla sawaal poocha gaya- ''if development is not engendered, it is endangered
 "it was translated into Hindi -" Development is troubled without including the same concerns as men and women
 '' yani iske anuwaad kaa mul sawaal se koi sarokaar nahin he
 In fact, this English sentence should be appropriate in Hindi, 'development that does not produce anything is dangerous
 ' tippaniyan In fact, in the same way, those who write answers in English also did not have any special moment

" '' iskaa hindi main anuwaad kiya gaya- ''stri-purush ke samaan sarokaaron ko shaamil kiye bina vikaas sankatagrast he
 This means that its translation has nothing to do with the original question

 However, Rahul had already sent his written letter of support

 At the Jaipur Chintan Shivir, the Congress was churning on Mission 2014 when a spark by Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement emerged which turned into shoals
 susheel kumaar scindia kaa itnaa kahana tha ki bijepi aag babula ho uthi
 The BJP gave Shinde's statement not just unfortunate but dangerous for the environment of the country
 bijepi ne is bayaan par sonia gandhi ko maafee maangane ko kaha he or gambhir parinaam kii chetavanee bhi di he
 BJP President Nitin Gadkari said that the Congress did not have the courage to respond to Pakistan
 magar bijepi or sangh ke khilaaf kuch bhi bol sakati he
 He said that BJP is neither against Muslims nor do we do politics of regionalism
 log marate rahen magar congressi sirf bayaanbaji karte rahegein
 BJP says that Congress's reality has come out from Shinde's statement
 bihar bijepi ke netaa giriraaj singh ne kaha ki agar congress itani hi gambhir he to aatankwaad ke khilaaf kadaa kanoon kyon nahin banaati
 By the way, the political experts are seeing the deep trick of politics behind Shinde's statement
 darasal, is saal jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai unamem se zyaadaatar main yaa to bijepi kii sarkaar he yaa phir bijepi un rajyon main majboot he
 Since the contest is directly between the BJP and the Congress, and the aggressive approach of the BJP to draw minority votes could be a profitable deal for the Congress
 duusari taraf, bijepi bhi hindu voton ko ikaitha karne ke liye scindia ke bayaan ko bhunaane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye 4 charnon ke matdaan ho chuke hai
 The parties are engaged in giving their election campaign a edge
 haavda main ek chunaav kaarykram ke dauraan bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet kii
 During this, he targeted West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamta Banerjee
 rajya main sarkaar giraane kii mamata banerjee ke aarope par amit shah ne kaha ki ham sarkaar giraane kii baat nahin kar rahe hai, lekin sarkaar unki he to use bachaane kaa kaam bhi unheen kaa he
 Amit Shah accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Left parties of imposing the politics of violence in West Bengal
 unhone kaha, 'pashchim bengal main pehle communist or baad main tiemasi ne hinsa kii raajnneeti ko bengal kii samskruti par thopane kaa kaam kiya he
 This is the point of our struggle
 ek jamaane main bengal main ravindra sangeet kii yahaan gunj sunai detii thi
 Kirtans of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were heard here
 yahaan bengali chintak, vaigyanik, sangeetkaar, sahityakar puure desh kaa maarg darshan karte the
 But now the politics of bomb blasts, bullets and violence is going on here
 main maanata hum ki bengal kii janata vikalp kii khoj main he
 Communists and Congress cannot make these choices
 lekin yah vikalp narendra modi ke netritv main keval bhartiya janata party ban sakati he
 The BJP president said that the kind of sentiment i am seeing in Bengal is clear that a big change is going to happen in Bengal
 bengal kii janata bijepi ko 23 se zyada siten dekar prachand bahumat se jeet dene vaali he
 On the question that last time TMC had got 40 per cent votes and BJP got 17 per cent votes, do you think that so many votes can be converted into seats? To this Amit Shah said, 'there are many states like Manipur, Tripura, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, where we had one to 22 percent vote, and crossed 50
 yahaan to hamaara 17 pratishat he
 Seeing the reaction of Bengal, it seems that this state is going to make a big contribution
 'bengal main badlaav bahut bahut dhire dhire hota he
 It took a long time to remove the left
 kya tiemasi ke khilaaf satta virdohi lahar taiyaar ho gai he? is sawaal par amit shah ne kaha, 'logon ne bahut ummiido ke saath tiemasi ko laayaa tha, lekin ummid par khara yahin utarane kii vajah se logon main jald hi niraashaa paidaa ho gai, or yahi niraashaa aaj mamata banerjee ko hataane kaa kaaran banane vaali he
 On Mamta Banerjee's statement of sending the pebble sweets to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah said, "we do not send pebbles, sending pebbles is their (mamta Banerjee) nature
" isko mithai samajhnaa hamaara nechar he
 We take it as a good luck
 sangheey dhaanche main vyaktigat dushmani nahin honi chahie
 'tmc's 40 mlas are planning to get in touch with the BJP and bring down the government of Bengal after May 23, but the BJP president said,' We are not talking about toppling the government
 agar swatah sarkaar gir jaati he to ham kya kar sakate hai
 They have a (TMC) government, their job is to save, it is their job to unite the legislators
 lekin ye jo janata kaa aakrosh he wo unke vidhayak bhi dekh rahe hai
 This outrage is not against the mlas but against Mamata and her nephew
 mamata ji or unke gundon ke khilaaf he
 Do you think that after May 23, the Trinamool government can be in the shape of a fall
 amit shah ne kaha, 'main is prakaar ke akalan main janaa nahin chahta he
 But the challenge is for Mamata Banerjee to keep the Trinamool mlas united in a situation where the mandate is going to come

 america raashtrapati baraak obama ke sansad daure ke dauraan vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke saansadon ko ‘shaleenta’ se pesh aane kii salaah di gayi he
 Confirming this, the Speaker's office sources said that the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry, not the Speaker's Office, had given this advice
 gauratlab he ki raashtrapati bill clinton dwaara varsh 2000 main sansad sadasyon ko sambodhit karne ke baad saansadon dwaara kiye gayi vyavhaar kii kaaphi aalochana hui thi
 Arjun Ram Meghwal, a senior member of the main opposition BJP in the Lok Sabha, told the language that the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry had issued a letter of advice to the leaders of all political parties in the past, which clearly states that US President Barack Obama's During the arrival of Parliament and specially addressed to the members of both the Houses, the members should behave 'decently' and maintain 'courtesy' । yah salaah patr party netaaon ko jari kiya gaya hai
 They have been asked to ensure that the mps of the concerned parties maintain decency in the House and their conduct should enhance the dignity of the Parliament
 pehle spikar karyaalay kii ore se saansadon ko is prakaar ke disha nirdesh jari kiye jane kii sambhaavna thi lekin spikar mira kumaar ne yah kehete hue nirdesh jari karne se inkaar kar diya tha ki isse saansad aahat mahasoos karenge
 He said that mps are mature and experienced and they know how to behave
 haalanki spikar karyaalay sutron ne yah jarur sweekaar kiya ki clinton ke daure ke dauraan saansadon dwaara kiye gaye vyavhaar ko lekar media main ai kuch repotaren ke baad spikar ne clinton ke sambodhan kii video ricarding nikalava kar dekhi thi
 Sources said that from the video recording, the speaker wanted to see if there was anything objectionable in the conduct of the mps
 marxvaadi saansad em bi rajesh ne palakkad se phone par sampark karne par aise kisi nirdesh kii jaankaree hone se inkaar karte hue kaha ki kal dilli pahunchane par hi unhen is sambandh main vistrut jaankaree mil sakati he
 But so far they have not received any such instruction from the party
 ek party netaa se yah puche jane par ki in nirdeshon ke maddenjar kya saansad america raashtrapati se haath nahin mila paaenge, jaisaa purv america raashtrapati bill clinton ke sansad daure ke dauraan hua tha, to is par unhone koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Recently, Speaker Meera Kumar, in an interview, denied the possibility of issuing any such guidelines, saying that there is no need to take such a step and he is confident that the mps will act better
 ullekhneey he ki purv america raashtrapati bill clinton ke saansadon ko sambodhit karne ke baad central haal main behad afra tafari kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya tha
 It is also recorded in the record of the Lok Sabha Secretariat that at that time three hundred mps shook hands with Clinton

 In the second quarter of the financial year, China grew 6 percent and India only 4

 27 janvari, 2050yahi upyukt tha ki yah ghoshnaa vidarbha rajya kii rajdhani nagpur main kii jaae
 In 2025, the Second State Reorganization Commission divided India into 50 states
 nagpur or vidarbha desh ke thik bich main hai
 Two major decisions were taken following the report of the State Reorganization Commission
 pehla, pradhanmantri ab swatantraaa diwas kaa bhaashan dilli ke laal kile se nahin denge
 Nor will the Republic Day parade be held only in Delhi
 isaki jagah inhen har baar alag-alag shaharon main kiya jayega
 This decision was first implemented in the year 2040, when India's urban population crossed 50 percent
 doosraa, ab mantri udghaatan karne, bhaashan dene ke liye or aam jivan ko baadhit karne vaale daure din main nahin karenge
 After the filing of a PIL in the year 2030, all such movements now take place at night and all the programs are held at midnight with the direction of the Supreme Court
 haalanki, kal kaa ganatantr diwas samaaroh kuch alag tha
 Readers will remember that when the 100 years of independence celebrations were celebrated on August 15, 2047, it was decided that the Prime Minister would give a mid-night speech on January 26 instead of August 15
 ise to 2048 se hi lagu kar diya gaya tha, lekin 26 janvari, 2050 ko jab bhartiya ganatantr ke 100 saal puure hue to aisa pehali baar hua ki bhaashan dene ke liye pradhanmantri khud upasthit nahin the
 Instead, his holographic image was presented at the new convention center on Miles Stone in the heart of India
 apane bhaashan main pradhanmantri ne orgenigeshan for iconomic kooparation and deveopment (oisidi) kii nai report kaa hawala diya
 After India became a member of OECD in 2040, its headquarters was shifted from Paris to New Delhi
 isaki nai report ke anusaar, 2050 main bharat parcheging power perity (pipipi) ke lihaaj se china ko peeche chhodte hue duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha ban gaya he
 IMF and World Bank data have been used in this report
 nominal exange rate ke maamle main america ko peeche chhodte hue bharat duniya kii duusari arthvyavastha ban chukaa he
 This means that the US dollar weakened against the Indian rupee
 nominal exange rate ke saath bharat kii prati vyakti aay ab 20,000 dollar tak pahunch gai he
 Recall that five years ago undp's Human Development Report indicated that India's Human Development Index 0
 9 kii seemaa ko paar kar chukaa he, jisase yah desh ucch maanav vikaas vikaas shrenee vaale sheersh deshon kii qatari main pahunch gaya
 The adult literacy rate in the country has increased to 95 per cent and the infant mortality rate has come down to five per thousand
 16wein vitt ayog ke vichararth vishyon ko vyapak banane ke baad yojana ayog ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 The planning and identification work of people with BPL has now been decentralized
 is tarah eneses ab bhi aankade jutata he (ab bade namoonay har saal liye jate hai) lekin jansankhya kii kitni fisadi garibi rekha ke neeche he, iske liye koi vishisht sankhya nahin he
 Different people use different poverty lines to calculate the data based on the NSS data
 haalanki, garibi kaa dayera 2 se 5 fisadi tak he
 We know that the last illiterate adult woman has been made literate in 2049 and was given an award at the Republic Day celebrations yesterday
 haalanki, vipakshi netaaon ne pradhanmantri ke bhaashan kii aalochana main deree nahin lagaai, unka tark tha ki sarkaar samasyaon ko chhipaane kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 For example, the rupee-dollar regulation rate has reached Rs 10 per dollar and with India's current account surplus and heavy capital account inflows it is impossible to stop further strengthening of the rupee, making exports un-competitive
 pichley teen dashakon se vaastavik jidipi main vruddhi 9 fisadi se zyada rahi he, jisaki vajah se bhartiya duutavaason ke liye har saal 4 karod vija aavednon ko nibataana mushkil hota he, jinamein se 50 lakh aavedan imigration ke liye hote hai
 Every year around 2,00,000 students apply to study in India
 bahut se avaidh tareeke se yaheen rah jate hai
 Foreign companies have also been accused of violating work permit rules
 varsh 2040 main 70 lakh ‘avaidh’ imigrants ko vaid kiya gaya he
 But many people worry that Indian culture and security are at stake
 china ke saath seemaa samjhaute ke baad uske saath mukt rup se puunji or kamgaaron kii seemaa paar awajahi kii ijaajat ke liye ek samjhauta bhi hua he
 India could not handle the issue of border dispute in isolation
 donon deshon kii saz sthiti ke nirdhaaran ke liye ek sanyukt bharat-china kaary samooh banaaya gaya he
 Western countries have been accusing India and China of factionalism, especially after a Chinese became World Bank president and an Indian became the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 bharat or china ke paksh kaa nirdhaaran dakshin asia or purvi asia ke anya padosi deshon se raay lene ke baad kiya jayega kyonki donon pramukh arthvyavasthaaen is ilaake kii anya arthvyavasthaaon ke saath ekikrut ho chuki hai
 This has become even more complicated due to the attitude of Pakistan as Pakistan has so far refused to grant MFN status to India
 lekin ab pakistan chaar praanton kaa sangh he or yah punjab evam sindh ke liye zyada samasya he, baaki do rajyon ke liye nahin
 The opposition has also criticized the government for not finalizing the audits of the 2048 Summer Olympics, which India had organized
 in khelon main bharat ko 367 medal hasil hue jise hamaari kshamta se kaaphi kam mana ja rahaa he
 a developed country like ours should have won at least 500 medals
 bibek debaroy centre for policy research, nai dilli main professor hai Recently, in the Kapil Sharma Show, Govinda, his wife Sunita Ahuja and daughter Narmada arrived as guests
 is episod ke pehle segment main govinda ke bhaanje krishna abhishek najar aae the
 But from the segment that Govinda shot with his family, Krishna Abhishek looked absent from there
 ab bombai times se baatcheet main krishna abhishek ne govinda kii maujuudagi main sho se missing hone par jawaab diya he
 Krishna Abhishek said- "I was told by the team that Sunit does not want me to be a part of that segment
" isliye unki entry se pehle maine apana act khatm kiya
 It was sad and shocking
 kyonki meraa kairactor sapana sho kaa ahm hissaa he
 "" However, ignoring all these things, i decided not to create any ruckus
 kyonki ye narmada kaa bada din tha
 They all came to promote Narmada's album
 agar main bada bhai hone ke naate apni choti bahan ke liye ye kar saktaa hum to main bhi apane bado se waisi hi ummid rakhata hum
 It is very sad that Kitchi Maman does not want us to fight and bring our issues in public, something like that happens in the meantime

 Apart from the law, he also raised me up
 
 
 iske alaava meri garlfriend kii umr kam he, so, uske apane aap hi aag se baahar nikal aane ke maukey maa ke mukaable zyaada hai

 South African farmer Alvin van der Merwe said that many years ago, laborers noticed that the langurs on a tree were soon licked
 us samay duusare pedo par bhi santare lage the, lekin languron ne sabase pehle us khaas ped ke santaron par hi jhapatta maaraa
 The same thing happened next year
 kisaan or khet mazdooron ke liye yah ek paheli ban gaya ki langur ek khaas ped ke santaron ko hi sabase pehle kyon apana bhojan banaate hai
 a laborer finally solved this mystery

 lakhanu uniwarsity se ritred professor om prakaash pandey ko sanskrit ke kshetra main mahatvapurn yogadan ke liye raashtrapati sammaan ke liye chunaa gaya he
 This honor will be given to him during the program organized on the occasion of Republic Day at Rashtrapati Bhavan
 pandey ko haal hi main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 About 50 books and 150 research papers of Professor Om Prakash Pandey have been published so far
 ve paris kii sorbon novili uniwarsity main bataur visiting professor kaam kar chuke hai
 Prof
 who was a member of the Secretary of National Ved Vidya Pratishthan
 pandey ko 2003 main veda ratna puraskaar, 2006 main saraswati sammaan, 2008 main sahitya academy, 2010 main valmiki sammaan se sammanit kiya ja chukaa he
 Here are excerpts from his conversation: Why does Sanskrit seem to be ending today? Vision is the biggest reason behind the end of Sanskrit language
 logon ne sahi tareeke se sanskrit padhane vaale ko vijan nahin diya
 Our biggest drawback is that we are not able to connect people and they are unable to connect
 duusari vajah yah he ki sanskrit kabhi jeevika kaa saadhan nahin ban pai
 Earlier people used to study Sanskrit and held high positions in governance
 vakt ke sath aisa hona band ho gaya
 What is your expectation from the government about Sanskrit? The administration has also neglected Sanskrit language
 jaise angreji bhashaa ko har str par badhaava mila, sanskrit ko bhi diya ja saktaa tha
 Have you heard that the central government is making Sanskrit mandatory in schools? This is not possible
 sanskrit bhashaa ko bataur subject hi rakhaa ja saktaa he lekin centre sarkaar ise anivaary nahin kar sakati he
 This is also because Sanskrit does not increase the vote bank of any party
 sanskrit kaa sabase zyada nuksaan kiya he alpsankhyak manovriti ne, kyonki sarkaar ko lagata he is bhashaa ke kshetra main kiye gaye kaam se ek varg ko laabh hoga, duusare varg ke log naaraaz ho jaaenge
 We need to rise above this mindset
 sanskrit padhane waalon ke liye khaas kitaaben aaj koun-si hai?sanskrit seekhney waalon ke liye aaj achche saadhan maujuud hai
 Constant work is being done in this language
 kai upanyaas hai or is bich kai kahaniyaan bhi likhi gai hai
 If you are interested in Sanskrit, then read Bhagavad Gita, Abhigyan Shakuntalam, Meghdoot
 aaj sanskrit dharm-karm tak simit kyon rah gai he?sanskrit ke dharm-karm tak simit rah jane ke peeche vajah he sanskrit padhaane waalon kii
 They have kept it in front of the people by just connecting it with religion
 aaj log sanskrit main ruchi nahin rakhte lekin apane bacchon ke namakaran main sanskrit naamon ko chunate hai
 What is the reason behind this? People also ask us to state the name of our child
 aisa isliye he kyonki sanskrit logon ke rakt main he
 People want to be connected with him even today because they believe that it is our culture
 sanskrit bhashaa se logon ko aaj kaise joda ja saktaa he?logon ko sahi vijan dikhaanaa hoga
 Those who teach Sanskrit will have to pay their responsibility seriously
 aapako itane bade sammaan se sammanit kiya gaya he, kya kahana chahenge ?yah sammaan thik vaisaa he jaise koi vaishno devi kii yatra par gaya ho or bich raste main thake hue insaan ko koi khaanaa-pani puch de
 Actually it is good to have respect
 phir abhi to aage sahitya ke kshetra main bahut se kaam karne hai

 The Election Commission dismissed complaints of Bluetooth tampering of evms during the Gujarat elections
 aaj subah matdaan ke dauraan congress ke varisht netaa arjuna modhwadiya ne porbandar main teen matdaan kendron par iviem se chhedchhad kii shikaayat kii thi
 The Commission stated that the device detected after Bluetooth turned on in the complainant's mobile phone was not an electronic voting machine (EVM) but a polling agent's mobile phone
 isse pehle, gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle charan kii 89 siton par matdaan jari rahane ke bich congress ke varisht netaa arjuna modhwadiya ne porbandar ke ek muslim bahul ilaake ke teen matdaan kendron par iviem se sambhavitchhedchhadki shikaayat kii thi 
 He claimed that some electronic voting machines (evms) were found connected to external devices via Bluetooth
 mukhya chunaav adhikari (siio) bibi swine ne shaam ko patrakaron ko bataaya ki unki ore se karai gai jaanch ke baad mili report ke mutabik, shikayatakarta ke mobile phone main jab bluetooth on kiya ja rahaa tha to ‘isio 105’ ke rup main ek anya upkaran uplabdh mil rahaa tha
 Swine said that it was feared that 'ECO 105' is an EVM in the polling booth, raising fears of possible tampering through Bluetooth technology
 unhone kaha ki jin matdaan kendron se shikaayat ai vahaan collector evam paryvekshak ko bheja gaya or shikayatakarta ko bhi bulaayaa gaya
 Swain said that the investigation was done in front of the local media and the report submitted by the District Election Officer (DEO) said that a polling agent had a mobile phone of the Intex company on which 'ECO 105' model number Was marked as unhone kaha ki manoj singerkhiya naam kaa ek matdaan agent mobile phone lekar chal rahaa tha
 He was standing close to the complainant's phone
 shikayatakarta ne sambhavat: sochaa hoga ki isio main ‘isi’ kaa matlab ellection kamishan he
 Earlier Modhwadia had said that we found that electronic voting machines in three polling booths of Muslim-dominated Memonwada are connected to external devices through Bluetooth
 jab bhi kisi mobile phone kaa bluetooth on kiya jaataa he to ‘isio 105’ naam kaa ek upkaran uplabdh dikhaai detaa he
 He alleged that this clearly meant that electronic voting machines could be tampered using the device via Bluetooth
 congress netaa ne kaha ki iviem main lagi chip bluetooth ke jariye program karne laayak lagati hai or yah chhedchhad kii ashanka paidaa karti he
 The voting system should be free from such linkage to external devices
 baharhaal, bhaajapa ne kaha ki modhwadiya kii ore se kii gai shikaayat dikhaati he ki vipakshi congress koi bahaanaa talash rahi he, kyonki vah jaanati he ki chunaavon main use karaari shikast milane vaali he
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that Congress members are saying that there is something wrong with evms
 chunaav ayog ko is par jawaab dena chahie, lekin ham kah sakate hai ki nattejey aane se pehle hi congress bahaane talashne main jute gai he, kyonki use chunaavon main apni haar dikhaai dene lagi he
 They are trying to hide behind evms

 raily se pehle amit shah ne vidhaan parishad main congress dal ke netaa dinesh pratap singh, unke bhai jila panchayat adhyaksh avadhesh singh samet kai congressi netaaon ko bhaajapa main shaamil karaayaa
 However, for fear of losing membership, Dinesh's younger brother and Rakesh Singh, MLA from Harchandpur assembly constituency of Rae Bareli, did not join BJP
 baad main amit shah ne raily se raibareli main gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf jang kaa aagaaj kar diya
 In his half-hour address, Amit Shah mentioned several times to members of the Panchavati family, indicating that Dinesh Pratap Singh would have a bigger role in Rae Bareli in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bhagava party ke ek bade netaa dinesh pratap singh ko sonia gandhi ke khilaaf raibareli loksabhaa seat se pratyaashee banane kii purajor vakaalat kar rahe hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP fielded Supreme Court lawyer Ajay Aggarwal against Sonia Gandhi
 chunaav main sonia gandhi ko saadhe paanch lakh vot mili jabaki ajay mahaj paune do lakh voton par hi simat gaye the
 In the 2017 assembly elections, the Congress could win only Rae Bareli Sadar and Harchandpur out of the five assembly seats in the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat
 bhaajapa sonia gandhi ke khilaaf aglaa loksabhaa chunaav kaaphi majbootee se laduya chaah rahi he
 That is why the BJP wants to weaken Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli by breaking the local Congress leaders
 bhaajapa kaa saath mila to shparivartan sankalp releey main dinesh pratap singh ne congress se apane 15 varshon ke rishte ko jamkar dhoyaa
 Targeting the development of Rae Bareli during the Congress government, Dinesh Pratap Singh said, "the National Flying Academy was established in Fursatganj but in the last 30 years not a single youth of Rae Bareli could become a pilot from here
 ''haalanki bhaajapa kii gherebandi ko todgaye ke liye khud sonia gandhi morcha sambhaal chuki hai
 Three days before the BJP rally, on April 18, Sonia Gandhi reached her parliamentary constituency Raibeli after a year and a half and paid Rs 70 crore
 se adhik kii yojanaon kii shuruyaat kii
 After Legislative Council member Dinesh Pratap Singh left the Congress, Sonia Gandhi has forwarded Congress' Youth Legislative Council member Dinesh Singh and young MLA Aditi Singh from Rae Bareli Sadar
 raibareli main shahar piesi ke saamne bane oonchaahar se samaajawaadee party (sapa) vidhayak manoj pandeya ke navnirmit awaas "neelam mainsion'' pahunch kar sonia gandhi ne nae samikarnon ke beej bo die
 Manoj Pandey, who is marginalized in SP, calls Sonia's arrival at his residence just a courtesy, but in this meeting, the seeds of a big political cloak of the coming days are hidden
 baharhaal, raibareli kii dharti ko panje kii pakad se mukt karakar camel khilaane kii ranneeti is baat se tay hogi ki bhagava dal raibareli or gandhi parivaar ke bich bane bhaavnaatmak judaav kii kaat kaise nikaal paata he?*** An Australian scientist has caught a mistake in the world-famous Oxford English Dictionary, which had not been noticed in the last 99 years, and because of this, the Oxford English Dictionary had to change the definition of Siphon

 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar, angrezi kii oxford dictionari main lagbhag ek shatabdi tak galat jaankaree di jaati rahi ki ek sifan ke peeche gurutvkarshan nahin, hawa kaa dabaav kaam karata he
 
 
 In 2010, Dr
 Stephen Hughes of Queensland University of Technology caught this mistake
 
 
 iske baad dow stephen hughes ne ek hypobaric chambar (hypobaric Chamber) main sifan or barometer (barometer) kii simaaen jaanchane ke liye ek prayog kiya, jisamen zyaada oonchai kaa prabhaav (effects of high altitude) banaaya ja saktaa he
 
 
 a siphon was drawn within this chamber at a height of one and a half meters, and when the pressure was equal to a height of 40,000 feet, a fountain formed at the top of the siphon, but the flow of water remained almost the same
 
 
 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar, oonchai ko 41,000 foot le jane par fawwara pani kii do dhaaraon main bant gaya, lekin jab ise 40,000 foot par waapas laayaa gaya, yah is tarah pehle jaisaa ho gaya, jaise kuch hua hi na ho
 
 
 Even with Mount Everest, the air pressure at 40,000 feet at an altitude of 10,000 feet is about 18 percent higher than the pressure at sea level
 
 
 prayog ke liye ek tub ke jariye ek-duusare se judi do baltiyaan rakhi gayi, jinamein ek ko duusare kii tulana main ooncha rakhaa gaya
 
 
 After this, the water was sent from a lower bucket to a height bucket through a pool pump
 
 
 dow stephen hughes ke mutabik, "yah tathy ki oonchi tathaa nichali baltiyon main pani kaa str sthir rahaa, yah sanket detaa he ki hawa kaa dabaav pani ko sifan main nahin dhakel rahaa he
 
 
 " dow stephen hughes ke mutabik, unke dwaara galati pakade jane par oxford english dictionari ne usamen sudhaar kiya he, tathaa hawa ke dabaav kaa zikr hataa diya he, lekin phir bhi nai paribhaasha puri tarah spasht nahin he

 Hughes has been published in the science journal 'scientific Reports'

 According to television reports, Fletcher sounded downbeat to the players and expressed his disappointment at the way the team came out despite a win over South Africa in the Super Eight
 bisisiai ne haalanki in reporton ko khaarij kar diya
 When BCCI President n Srinivasan was asked to comment on Fletcher's attitude, he said, "I have no information about what you are saying
" main media report ke aadhaar par is maamle par tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 Team manager Sanjay Patel said that there is no truth in these reports
 unhone kaha, ‘yah aadharahin report hai
 This is only gossip and they do not contain truth
 ’ Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has criticized the statement made by PM Modi regarding Balakot attack
 unhone kaha ki kaha ki piem modi (PM Modi) kii raajnneeti kii sachai saamne aane ke baad ab vah janata ke radar par aa gayi hai
 Priyanka Gandhi (priyanka Gandhi) said after the conclusion of her road show in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, that Jumla had been speaking in the government for five years, thought it was cloudy weather, i will not come in the radar
 dhyaan ho ki piem modi ne shanivaar ko ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki unhone kharaab mausam ke baavjood pakistan ke balakot main aatanki shiviron par bhartiya vayusena ke mishan ko manjuuri di thi
 This was contrary to the suggestion of experts, because he (prime Minister) believed that due to cloudy sky, Indian fighter aircraft would not come under the radar of Pakistan
 rafel vimaan saude par pradhanmantri ko gherte hue priyanka (priyanka Gandhi) ne kaha ki vah kehete the ki bhrashtachar khatm karenge
 Then who got the Rs 30,000 crore Rafale scam? Amid the chants of "chowkidar Chor Hai", the Congress General Secretary said in the Nukkad Sabha that he was such a big defense expert that he himself decided that a company would make a warship which has not built such aircraft till date
 is company ko jameen de di gayi or theka bhi de diya gaya
 These aircraft were not built by the government company Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HL)
 priyanka gandhi ne aage kaha ki vah itane bade raksha visheshgy hai ki unhone sochaa ki mausam cloudi he or vah aisa kaam karenge, to radar par nahin aayenge
 But he has come on the radar of the public
 chaahe barish kaa mausam ho yaa khuli dhoop ho, sab samaj gayi hai ki inaki raajnneeti kii sachaai kya he
 In the current Lok Sabha elections, Priyanka retaliated when the ruling BJP dragged former Prime Ministers like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki jaise skool main kuch bachche aise bhi hote hai jo daud main haarane kaa purvabhaas hote hi khud hi gir padate hai or duusare bacchon par jhootha dosha madhte hue kehete hai ki unhone laat markar yaa dhakka dekar unhen gira diya
 This is the situation of the PM of the country today
 vah chunaavon main kah rahe hai ki nehru ji ne aisa kiya, indira ji ne aisa kiya or rajeev ji ne vaisaa kiya
 Priyanka Gandhi said that in this century, come and tell the questioning people what you have done for them in the last five years
 congress mahasachiv ne modi par satta ke ahankaar ke kaaran desh ke aam aadmi se duuri banane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki unhen america ghoomane kaa mauka mil gaya

 vah japan main dhol bajaakar aa gayi
 He also ate biryani in Pakistan
 lekin vah pichley paanch saalon main apane hi sansadeey kshetra varanasi main ek bhi garib yaa kisaan ke ghar nahin gayi
 Have you seen him hug from a commoner? Priyanka Gandhi said that a few days ago, in the photo printed in the newspaper, i saw the Prime Minister kissing a child on her lap
 lekin photo ke neeche capshan likhaa tha ki yah baccha (bhaajapa adhyaksh) amit shah kaa pota he
 i was thinking that he is cherishing the child of a common countryman by obeying me
 lekin baat kuch or hi nikali
 Continuing the direct attack on the Prime Minister, the Congress General Secretary said that he has disrespected the promises he had given you and the expectations he had raised in you
 loktantr main sabase bada kaayar netaa vah hota he jisamen janata kii aawaaj sunne kii himmat nahin hoti
 a leader today is your Prime Minister who does not have the courage to listen to your voice
 unhone bhaajapa ke rashtrawaad ke naare par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, "yah kaisaa rashtrawaad he jo mahilaon, adivaasiyon, daliton, kisaanon or naujavaanon ko surakshit nahin rakh saktaa?" notebandi ko desh kii janata ke liye bada sadma qaraar dete hue priyanka ne kaha, "notebandi ke baad bainkon kii qatari main ek bhi udyogpati nahin laga tha
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi was the only leader of the country, who stood in queue with people shoulder to shoulder at the time of demonetisation
 lekin is baat ko lekar inke (bhaajapa ke) tamaam netaaon ne rahul kaa majaak udaaya tha
 He said that the GST system filled with complex taxes has broken the back of the small shopkeepers and they are contemplating to shut down their business sadly
 (input bhashaa se) The Maharashtra government has decided to form a squad to curb open defecation across the state and change the mindset of the people who do so

 It said that these teams would include local bodies, self-help groups, ngos, students' representatives and social workers working in the area for cleanliness

 whatsapp has announced end to end encryption for chats
 yani ab sarkaar se lekar khud whatsap ko bhi kisi yugers ke whatsap chats padhane kaa akhriyaar nahin he
 In such a situation, the security agencies have objected to this encryption of whatsapp
 unka maananaa he iskaa yuj karke anti neshnal eliments apane khatarnaak mansoobon ko anjaam de sakate hai
 Let us tell you that whatsapp's messages, photos and videos have been announced by the company to encrypt with 256 bit security
 iske baad ab security agenciyon ko bhi iskaa acces milanaa naammumkin ho gaya he
 According to a security official, whatsapp's move is a potential security threat
 sanddhantik rup se bharat main avaidh he whatsapapako bataa den ki bharat main information technology se jude koi bhi aise act nahin hai jinamein kisi privet sarvice ko 256-bit ancripshan kii parmishan di gai ho
 In such a situation, it would be considered illegal
 department of telecom ne 2007 main ek niyam banaaya tha jiske mutabik, binasarkaar ke parmishan ke koi bhi privecinternet player ancripshan ke liye 40-bit se zyada kaa yuj nahin kar saktaa he
 It is worth noting that the end to end encryption given in whatsapp is 256 bit secure
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kyasarkaar iske khilaaf koikadam uthaati he yaa nahin
 However, recently, the government brought a draft against whatsapp's deleting chats, which was taken down after heavy furore

 Advani said that the Congress should not try to find a 'scapegoat' for the Mumbai blasts
 adwani ne apane blog par likhi tippanee main centre se kaha ki use aatankwaad kii chetavanee ko lekar apni niti main ‘moulik’ badlaav karnaa chahie or yadi aisa nahin kiya gaya to bhavishya main aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahengi
 Referring to Chavan's statement about NCP taking over charge of Maharashtra's home ministry, he said, "the Congress party should not be allowed to find a scapegoat for the recent bombings in Mumbai
" aam aadmi yah padhakar hairaan ho rahaa hoga ki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri visphoton ke liye rakanpa ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai, kyonki rajya main grih mantralay uske paas tha
 Advani said that Union Home Minister p Chidambaram himself exonerated Maharashtra Home Minister RR Patil on the allegation that there was no espionage lapse in the blast case, which means that there is no fault of the local police was
 unhone aatankwaad se mukaable main sarkaar kii niti main parivartan kii maang karte hue kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak mumbai main logon ke maare jane kaa prashn he, aap rajya ke mukhyamantri athwa grih mantri ko jimmedaar tehra sakate hai, lekin iske saath hi nayi dilli bhi utani hi jimmedaar he
 "advani said," The Prime Minister and the Congress President should understand that unless there is a fundamental change in the policy of the Government of India to counter terrorism, such incidents will continue to happen
 ’’chavaan ne ek vivaadaaspad bayaan main kaha tha ki congress kaa mahatvapurn grih mantralay kaa prabhaar rakanpa ko dene ke liye sahamat hona ek galati thi
 His statement was strongly reacted by Congress ally NCP
 chavaan ne apane bayaan ne kaha tha, ‘‘meraa maananaa tha ki vah ek galati thi
 We should have reconsidered that
 mujhe aise kisi gathbandhan sarkaar ke bare main jaankaree nahin, jisamen grih, vitt or yojana jaise mahatvapurn mantralayon kaa prabhaar mukhyamantri ke paas na ho

 Nawazuddinthoda became emotional during the rehearsal of a scene in No Land Man, but because he is very professional, he immediately took over himself
 magar mujhe unke imotional hone kii vajah baad main pataa chali
 Actually, there is a scene in the film in which Nawaz has to talk to his reel sister Saima over the phone
 View this post on instagramlife of an artist! While rehearsing a scene from No Land's Man, @nawazuddin
 _siddiqui became slightly emotional but, since he is extremely professional, Nawaz quickly regained his composure
 Later on i came to know the reason
 The scene i mentioned was between him and his sister whose reel name was Saima
 He asked me if i knew his sister's name is Saima too
 i answered negative as my script was written five years ago and i had no idea about his sister
 He then told me his sister Saima has been suffering from cancer for eight years and he has been trying everything he could to help her in this battle
 So whenever he had scenes with Saima, he was feeling extremely emotional
 i didn't know how to respond to this strange connection
 i forgot this quickly as i had other things to deal with
 Two days ago, while we were shooting a scene, he received a call
 We had no idea what was going on
 He completed the scene brilliantly
 After we packed up, i came to know he lost his sister while we were shooting that scene
 i have recently developed some idea about this man's attachment to his family
 As someone who is strongly connected to the family, i could completely understand how he was feeling
 i didn't know how to deal with this situation
 But he knew
 While coordinating everything back home, he continued his shoot and made sure our New York shoot is completed
 He will fly home today
 Maybe he will be standing silently in front of her grave
 Maybe they will speak thousand words in silence
 Maybe fiction and reality will merge into each other

 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) ke pramukhimran khaanne shanivaar kopakistanke 22wein pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath grahan kii
 a day before he was sworn in, he proved a majority in the lower house of the Pakistani Parliament
 is dauraan unhone pakistan kii janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki hamaari sarkaar main desh ke lutere bakhshae nahin jaaenge
 During this, he looked very aggressive
 bataur pradhanmantri unhone apane pehle sambodhan main kaha, 'main aaj apane vatan se vaada karata hum ki ham vah tabdili laaenge jiske liye yah mulk lambey samay se koshish karata rahaa he
 We have to maintain strict accountability in this country
 main vaada karata hum ki main pakistan ko luutane waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karuunga
 i will bring back the black money which has been white
 jo paise shiksha, swasthya or pani par kharch hone chahie the, ve logon kii jeb main chale gaye
 'the opposition to the speech is because in this speech, he was not seen as a Prime Minister but as the leader of an opposing camp
 unke is bhaashan se pakistan ko aashaa thi ki wo desh kii baat karenge lekin unke bhaashan ke zyaadaatar hisse main vipaksh par chhintakashi or hamalavar rukh dikhaa
 Contrary to expectations, his address featured his traditional fairbrand style
 jisamen unhone puure time vipaksh ko nishane par rakhaa, raajnneetik virodhiyon kaa uphaas kiya
 The people of Pakistan expected a balanced speech from him, which should have talked about inclusiveness, reconciliation and openness to political opponents to give the government a better direction
 lekin unhone apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ko kadavaahaton ke saath chunauti di
 In fact, Shahbaz warned that he would start demonstrations if the government did not investigate fraud in the elections
 isi par imran ne shahbaaj ko di-chowk main ek maheene tak dharna karne kii chunauti di
 Imran said, 'don't try to blackmail me
 ' saal 1996 mempitiaiki sthapana karne vaale pashtun ne kaha ki vah 22 saalon ke sangharsh ke baad is mukaam par pahunche hai
 Indicating indirectly to Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted in the corruption case, Imran said that he would not be lenient towards any 'dacoit'
 khan ke is bhaashan ke baad raajnneetik or saarvajanik galiyaaron main ek tarah kaa rosh dekha gaya
 Many said that Khan should have given a speech in a calm and serious manner, the new Prime Minister would not have expected such a speech
 raajnneetik vishleshak nahin hai khushpakistan ke purv chunaav ayog ke sachiv kanvar dilashaad ne piem imran khan ke bhaashan ko lekar express tribune se baat kii
 He said, 'they need to improve their ways, the sooner the better
 ' unhone kaha ki khan ko nai raajnneetik vaastaviktaaon main samyojit karne kii jarurat he kyonki vah sheersh par he or neshnal assembly main desh chalaane vaale kursi par baithna he
 Dilshad said that an elected prime minister should not behave like a leader of the opposition
 unhen aalochana kaa saamana karnaa hoga or unhen aapasi matbhedon va tanaav ko khatm karne vaale shaks kii bhoomika nibhaani padegi
 According to Dilshad, he lost his temper during the majority test in Pakistan's Parliament, upset by the opposition's attitude
 unhone kaha, 'shaayad imran se yah nahin dekha gaya ki pipipi kii shuukravaar ke chunaav main matdaan se dur rahane kii ghoshnaa spasht rup se unke paksh main thi
 Indeed, he was hoping that the opposition's response would be formal after the majority test
 lekin vipaksh ke netaaon ne sadan main matdaan ke baad gussa jaahir kiya or virodh bhi
 It seems that after this unexpected reaction, the newly elected Prime Minister lost his temper and became aggressive
 lekin unhen shant rahanaa siikhnaa hoga
 Imran said, 'I have not come on the shoulders of any dictator; i have reached this point after 22 years of struggle
 sirf ek netaa ne mujhase zyada sangharsh kiya or vah mere hero (pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali) jinna the
 The party people were also unhappy with the style of speech, even after the majority test, the PTI leaders themselves admitted that the attitude of their leader ie Imran Khan in the House was inappropriate
 vahiin, khan kii party ke kuch netaaon ne unka samarthan bhi kiya
 On the condition of anonymity, a PTI leader said that Imran Khan wanted his speech to be very balanced
 saath hi imran ne party ko mili jeet ke baad die gaye apane bhaashan se kuch alag dikhaane kii koshish kii
 He had specially prepared for this
 unhone kaha, 'lekin chijen waisi nahin huin jaisaa unhone sochaa tha
 He got out of his way after the opposition created a ruckus in the House
 mujhe ummid he ki wo aage sanbhal jaaenge
 Senior PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah said, while speaking on Khan's speech, "you are the Prime Minister of the country
" aapako us pad kii garima kaa khyal rakhte hue apane str kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 You have to learn to behave
 ' unhone tanj kasate hue kaha, 'imran khan satta main alpakaal ke liye hi rah paaenge
 But as long as you are there, you have to learn to respect others
 ' The film industry has been divided into two camps with regard to the Jauhar scene of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat
 darasal, haal hi main swara bhaskar ne bhansaali ke naam ek open letters likhakar film ke jariye mahilaon ko vastu kii tarah pesh karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He had said, women are not just vajina
 pichley kuch dinon se bollywood ke seleb is par pratikriyaayein de rahe hai
 Swara is also answering Twitter responses and is also asking questions
 lekin ek intervyuu main unhone baar-baar us shabd naam lene se parhez kiya, jis twitor par likhaakar wo feminism par bahes kar rahi hai
 According to a report from a respectfully placed talkspotboy, Swara said, "I think everybody has the right to give their feedback
" maine apni baat ko bahut sammanjanak tareeke se rakhaa
 i had no bad intention
 maine jo sawaal puche wo bahut jaij the
 If people do not agree with me then that is also fine
 ye ek loktantr he philhal abtak
 When Suchitra got surrounded by Swara, the answer was 'phani, only Vajaina Yaadh Rahee', hesitating to repeat the word Swarajab Swara was asked, you thought that there would be so much ruckus on it, then he said that i have no idea of this at all
 Was
 mujhe nahin pataa tha jo log filmon se connected nahin hai wo bhi apni raay dene or meri baat par apni naaraazgi jaahir karenge
 When he was questioned on the language and the word used in the open letter, he replied, i did not know that the word i wrote in the letter starts with 'V' in English and 'Y' in Hindi
 us par itnaa logon ko bura lag jayega
 Swara, who used bold words in the open letter, felt very hesitant to speak those same words at the event
 unhone yahan tak kaha, 'main yahaan us shabd kaa naam nahin le sakati kyonki kai family channel bhi yahaan event main maujuud hai
 On "hollow Feminism", the director advised to go to Bastar, Swara said, "I am always with Haranipadmavati, always in the tone of clarifying, i have supported Sanjay sir from the beginning
" maine karani sena ke khilaaf lagaataar bayaan die hai
 i always talked about Padmavati's right
 lekin ek baar film ho jaati he to wo public plateform par a jaati he
 Then when Padmavat has put such big things in front of the society, then i felt that my words should also come before the country
 mujhe bolne ke paise nahin die kisi neswara se poocha gaya ki kya unhone jo bolaa wo ped tha? naaraaz swara ne kaha, 'aap logon ne to kabhi mujhe paise nahin die
 Next time the media also asks me questions, it would be good if you give money first
 ' swara ne un logon par sawaal uthaa die jo log ise publicity stant bataa rahe hai
 He said that a girl who is an artist is called whenever she questions
 ki usne sach bolne ke paise liye hai
 He has no character
 use jalan hoti he kisi kii safalataa se
 All the questions i asked were valid
 mujhe nahin pataa tha bharat kii janata itnaa padhati he
 It is good to know that people have read my letter and their interest has woken up
