 uttarakhand ke uttarkashi main durgam kshetra main tainaat shikshika uttara pant bahuguna ko 28 june ko mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne janata darbar main nilambit karne ke aadesh de die
 Uttara had heard them scrambled when the demand for transfer was not heard
 vaise baad main shiksha mantri arvind pandey ne uttara ko phone karke khed jataayaa or raahat dilaane kaa aashwaasan diya
 After the meeting of BJP state president Ajay Bhatt and national president Amit Shah in Delhi, the BJP and the government have again become aggressive on Uttara
 bhaajapa kii sibar team bhi shikshika ko laaparvaah bataane main jute gai
 Actually, according to sources, Shah has a clear directive not to take a U-turn in this episode and justify the cm's action
 pradesh ke ucch shiksha rajya mantri dhan singh ravat ne kaha, ‘‘shikshika uttara bahuguna puri taiyaari ke saath janata darbar main ai thim
 An attempt was made to tarnish the image of CM under a plot
 ’’vahiin uttara kahati hai, ‘‘main uttarkashi ke naugaanv block ke aage jyeshthwari naamak sthaan par skool teacher hum
 i have been away from home and children for almost 25 years
 meraa betaa dehradun main rahata he or beti noida main
 The husband died in 2015
 mukhyamantri chaahate to kah sakate the ki haa kuch karenge, sunwaayee hogi
 Now what to expect from the government
 ’’ isse pehle bhi bhaajapa karyaalay main ek mantri ke janata darbar main haldwani ke ek transporter ne jehar kha liya tha, to sarkaar kii kaaphi kirakiri hui thi
 At the same time, Raghunath Singh Negi, president of Uttarakhand Jan Sangharsh Morcha, says, "A teacher has been suspended by CM, while cm's wife has been serving in the Sugam region for the last 22 years in her 26 years of service, she is also in Dehradun 
 is dauraan unka kisi duusari jagah tabadalaa nahin hua he
 The cm's wife has not been transferred even after getting promotion
 ’’ yah jaankaree ek artiai main saamne ai he
 Actually, the media in-charge of the Morcha Praveen Sharma had put up an ITI in which he asked for full details of the cm's wife Sunita Rawat's service in the education department
 iske jawaab main vitt mantri prakaash pant kehete hai, ‘‘mukhyamantri kii patni alti cader main niyukt hai or purv main durgam sthanon par sevaayen de chuki hai
 His cadre belongs to the mandal, so he can be transferred anywhere within the mandal, while the cadre of Uttara Bahuguna is from the district
 so, unka tabadalaa jile se baahar nahin ho saktaa
 But questions are being raised about the wives of many politicians
 soobe ke vitt evam sansadeey kaarymantri prakaash pant kii patni pithoragarh main posting hone ke baavjood raajpur road sthit rajkeey inter kalege main sevarat hai
 Sonam Tamta, the teacher wife of Minister of State for Textiles Ajay Tamta, has been absent from Mumma Inter College for almost three years
 bina kaaran or kisi soochna ke unki anupasthiti par shiksha vibhaag maun saadhe hue he
 The wife of BJP MLA Dhan Singh Negi from Tehri has also been posted in GGIC on Rajpur Road, Dehradun since 2009
 bhaajapa ke pradesh upaadhyaksh jyoti prasad garola kii shikshika patni bhi pichley ek saal se dehradun sthit shiksha nideshaalay main atachament main pahunchi hai
 At the same time, the son-in-law of Minister Prasad Naithani, who was the Minister of Education in the Congress Government, has been posted in the school of Jamai Kotla near Premnagar in Dehradun for the last several years
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya media prabharee anil baluni kii ucch shiksha main tainaat patni bhi haldwani main padhaane kii bajaae dilli main sthaneey ayukta ke bataur tainaat ho gai hai
 *** Apparently, the politically influential state is able to get the desired postings and the common people are cursed in difficult areas

 haalia vidhansabha chunaavon main upi jaise rajyon main congress ke kamjor pradarshan ke baad bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne guuruuvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 Sonia Gandhi has just returned from the US after her medical treatment and the two leaders met at her Delhi residence
 is maamle main nitish kumaar kii party jadyu ne kaha ki yah kaaphi samay se lambit shishtachar bhent thi
 But sources are looking at this meeting as part of JDU chief's efforts to 'grand alliance' in 2019 general elections against BJP
 ullekhneey he ki nitish kumaar ke netritv main jadyu, rajd or congress ne bihar vidhansabha chunaav main mahagathbandhan banaakar bijepi ko shikast di thi
 Now at the national level, this kind of 'mahagathbandhan' is starting to arise within the parties
 nitish kii sonia se mulaakaat ko bhi is sandarbh main dekha ja rahaa he
 Anyway, Nitish Kumar has been calling for a grand alliance of secular parties to compete against PM Narendra Modi at the national level, as it was done before the Bihar elections
 bijepi se haar ke baad vaise bhi congress is vakt 'aatmamanthan' kar rahi he
 According to sources in this link, Nitish Kumar while advising Sonia Gandhi said, "instead of reacting to Narendra Modi, we should decide our own agenda
 '' kamobesh aisi hi salaah congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko bhi nitish kumaar de chuke hai
 The comments ullekhneey he ki sonia gandhi swasthya kaarnon se haalia daur main saarvajanik rup se zyada sakriy nahin dikhaai di hai
 Even during the UP assembly elections, she could not campaign in Amethi and Rae Bareli, the seats considered to be the stronghold of the Gandhi family
 yahaan kii kul 10 siton main se congress keval do hi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 Her last public appearance was before the UP elections at a rally in Varanasi where she became ill and had to return to Delhi midway
 is mulaakaat ko july main hone ja rahe raashtrapati chunaavon ke lihaaj se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 In this regard, JDU leader KC Tyagi said that the two leaders also discussed the possibilities of a common candidate from the opposition for the post of President
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha, ''sabase badi vipakshi party kii netaa hone ke kaaran sonia gandhi ko is masale par aguai kerani chahie
 KC Tyagi also said that Nitish Kumar has discussed this issue with the Left parties too and has received positive response
 vaise bhi nitish kumaar rashtriya str par piem narendra modi se muqabla karne ke liye dharmanirpeksh dalon ke mahagathbandhan ke liye aahvaan karte rahe hai, jaisaa ki bihar chunaav se pehle kiya gaya tha
 After the defeat of BJP, the Congress is doing 'introspection' at this time
 isi kadi main sutron ke mutabik nitish kumaar ne sonia gandhi ko salaah dete hue kaha, ''narendra modi par pratikriya dene ke bajaay ham logon ko apana agenda khud tay karnaa chahie
 Nitish Kumar has already given similar advice to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 tippaniyan It may be noted that Sonia Gandhi has not appeared more publicly in recent times due to health reasons
 yahaan tak ki upi vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bhi vah gandhi parivaar kaa garh maani jane vaali siton amethi or raibareli main bhi prachaar karne nahin ja sakin

 The opposition, which has been creating a ruckus in the Lok Sabha for the past several days over the decision of the central government to invalidate the big notes, today expressed strong opposition to a statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raised slogans of 'prime Minister apologize'
 sadasyon ke baari hangaame ke kaaran sadan kii kaarywahi ek baar ke sthagan ke baad puure din ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Members of the opposition parties were opposing a statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on demonetisation, along with the demand for immediate adjournment under Rule 56 of the postponed division of the house
 sadan kii kaarywahi subah shuru hone par is vishay ko lekar apni maangon ke samarthan main congress, trinmul congress, vam dal ke sadsy asana ke sameep aakar narebaaji karne lage
 Expressing his objection to the statement made by the Prime Minister at a function, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said today that what the Prime Minister said is not correct
 unhen sadan main bolnaa chahie kyonki satr chal rahaa he
 At a book release ceremony this morning, Modi said that the pain of those criticizing the government, accusing them of not preparing before the demonetisation decision, is that they themselves did not get the time to prepare
 agar unhen 72 ghante kaa samay taiyaari ke liye mil jaataa to vah pradhanmantri kii tarif karte
 Congress and Trinamool Congress members were heard shouting slogans like 'prime Minister come to the House, if you have courage, then speak in the House'
 adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne sadasyon se apane sthaan par jane kaa aagrah kiya or sadan kii kaarywahi chalaane kaa prayaas kiya
 During this time some questions were also taken and the concerned ministers also gave their answers

 On Tuesday, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi addressed the rally in East Imphal in Manipur
 rahul ne raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa, rahul ne kaha ki piem ne 2014 main dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge dikhaai lekin baad main gabbar singh niklaa
 Manipur will go to polls on March 4 and 8
 imphal main bole rahul gandhi -- manipur ke logon ne duniya ko bahut kuch diya, yahaan ke log nechar kii izzat karte hai
 - Manipur: Rahul Gandhi said - Sold in America also made shawls of Made in Manipur - will help by finding youth by choosing - PM did not fulfill the promise of Sports University - PM talks a lot, National Highway not ready for three years , There was talk of 100 days
 - manipur ne preeped electrucity kaa model he, puri duniya main isaki tarif hui
 This caused confusion in the mind of PM Modi
 - kuch maheene pehle sonia ji ne mujhe phone kar kaha ki pehali baar piem modi ne mujhe phone kiya or kaha ki maine aitihaasik kaam kiya he or kaha ki hamanen naga acord kiya he
 - But did not tell the Chief Minister about this, even the ministers of PM Modi did not know
 lekin kisi ko is faisle kaa pataa nahin laga
 In 2014, PM Modi showed all the good-hearted Dulhania pictures, but later came out of Gabbar Singh
 - 2014 main piem modi ne sabhi achche din kii dil vaale dulhaniya pikchar dikhaai, lekin baad main gabbar singh kii nikal kar aayaa
 One day an idea came and stopped 500-1000 notes and laughed
 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 - Gold did not go behind Swiss bank but put the common man in line
 bank ke baahar linon main koi bhi amir nahin khadaa tha
 - On November 22, 2014, Sahara was raided, income tax paid Rs 2 crore on October 30 in the paper entry
 - iske baad birla ke kaagajon par bhi gujarat siem kaa naam aayaa, or piem modi ibobi singh par sawaal uthaate hai
 But there is no evidence against them
 - 15 lakh rupee, sports uniwarsity kii baat kii lekin kuch nahin mila, jahaan bhi jate hai nafrat failaate hai piem modi, jhuthe vaade karte hai
 i want Manipur to bring 5 medals to the Olympics in the coming time
 - is pradesh ko nagpur kii vichaardhaara nahin chalaa sakati, yahaan manipur kii vichaardhaara hi chalegi
 Next time PM comes here, ask him a question what did you do for Manipur
 rajdhani ke fliowaron par billboard bhi bahut kuch un hiron kii tarah hi damakate hai jo un par dikhaai gai jaani-maani model dhaaran kiye hoti hai
 Every 100 meters, a new billboard becomes noticeable — shining, beautiful, rich, and reflecting the lifestyle that the brand's founder, Nirav Modi, tried so hard to embrace
 vahaan se bas thodi hi duuri par roj alssubah phool waalon kii ek toli dakshin dilli kii dephence colony main brands ke flagship store ke peeche kii sarvice len main apane kaam par lag jaati he
 They make adorable decorations with the most beautiful fresh flowers to decorate the store
 yah pehla store tha jo modi ne 2010 main apana julri brands launch karte vakt sthapit kiya tha or iskaa dizin bhi spanish vaastushilpi jam heyan ne banaaya tha
 Decorated with a private display room for high and affluent customers, this store became the standard for all stores upon seeing it
 neerav modi koun he?julri kaarobaar main lage kisi bhi shaks se puuchhen to ve aapako bataaenge ki ek bharosemand brands sthapit karne main dashakon kaa vakt lag jaataa he or duniya bhar main apni saakh kaayam karne vaale brands ko banane man to or bhi zyada
 In the diamond and jewelery business, most people generally avoid fame and pomp, and Modi was no different
 jab bhi uskaa intervyuu liya gaya, vah jaldi hi baatcheet ko khud apane upar se hataakar apane diginon or us brands par le aayaa jo usne banaaya tha
 It allowed its PR machinery and marketing to build its image in such a way that only the top-notch magazines had access to it, and asked them to make sure that its products were displayed singly and discretely on one page, not in the midst of other brands' crowds (the largest fashion brands around the world do the same)
 beete 20 saal kaa mukammal khaakaa khinchaa gaya tha, jisamen modi ne apni kamyaabi kii yojana banaai or vahaan pahunchane ke liye lagaataar kaam kiya
 The 47-year-old Modi is a man who grew up amidst garish jewels and diamonds while listening to stories from his father
 vah raat-din jaise gahane-jevar hi odhata-bichhaata tha
 His father Deepak Modi moved to Antwerp, Belgium in the sixties
 deepak ke bhi johari pita deepak ko is kaarobaar main laae or chalis ke dashak main mumbai se singapore jaakar bas gaye the
 He used to sell raw diamonds to the customers of India and remained a merchant of diamonds — he had no desire or plan to enter the retail market
 teesri peedi kaa neerav hiron kaa parkhi or kaarobaari he
 He is a Jain of Palanpur
 usne gujarat ke is ilaake ke duusare jainiyon kii tarah hi chamak-damak se bharaa samrajya khadaa kiya
 Palanpur has more than 400 families in Antwerp and trades all diamonds
 unhone shuruyaat main is kaarobaar ke centre main rahe yahudiyon ko peeche chhod diya he
 Nirav was born to a Gujarati parent in India, grew up in Antwerp and spent the bulk of his childhood with a desire to become a music conductor
 in mansoobon ko alabatta us vakt tilanjali de di jab usne tay kiya ki vah wharton se japani or finance kii padhai karenge
 After a year, he decided to leave it too
 19 baras kii umr main vah mumbai chale aayaa
 His initiation into the family business began under the umbrella of maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, who was the leader of Gitanjali Gems
 usne 1985 main yah company apane pita se hasil kii thi
 Vigil felt that if he wanted to expand his business, he would need a much larger portfolio of branded diamond jewelery that he could sell in retail markets around the world
 usne gili, nakshatra, di damas, sangini or duusare sah-brands launch kiye or unhen desh bhar main faile 4,000 se zyada bikri thikaanon par bechaa
 Modi spent nine years in Gitanjali Gems and here he learned the tricks of his business
 pichley kuch saalon ke dauraan uske saath kareeb se kaam kar chuke ek shaks kehete hai, ''ve parfectionist the, hameshaa aage badhate rahane vaale shaks
 Even before the task at hand was completed, they used to start planning the next step
 unhone bade sapane dekhe
 In 2004, Modi launched Firestar International, which discovered and traded the finest diamonds around the world
 chaukasee is company main partner ban gaya jiskaa khalis mulya 2
 3 billion dollars is said
 neerav modi brands kii dizin or uske baad lonching to mahaj ittaphacan hui
 In an earlier interview to India Today, he said, "I wanted to get into the diamond jewelery business, i wanted to be in a place where this thing was just about to start
" ''modi ne ek dost ke kehane par digining shuru kii, jinase uski mulaakaat achaanak ek party main hui thi
 This friend insisted on designing a pair of earrings for them
 usne inkaar kar diya
 She remained adamant and even threatened her in Mumbai's Prasad Chambers
 unki jid ke aage aakhirkaar vah dizin ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 a month later, when she came to see his earrings designed, she jumped with joy
 modi ne kaha tha, ''unki pratikriya dekhakar mujhe ehsaas hua ki kisi kii jindagi main us kism kii khushi lanakitni adbhut baat hogi
 He founded the brand on his own in 2010 and became a superstar of jewelery overnight
 us bazaar main jahaan saikadon julri brands maujuud the, teen vajahon se vah alag dikhaai detaa tha
 One, his designs, which were elite, confident, dazzling, international and comfortable and were made with the finest diamonds
 do, uski shakhsiyat—usase milane vaala harek shaks kahata he ki vah nafasat pasand or mridubhashi shaks he
 Three, the consummate businessman, who used to look at business opportunities and looked back, probably used to work on them without much thought
 ek baar yah poochne par ki lagjri kaa unke liye kya matlab he, usne kaha tha, ''lagjri kaa matlab he had se zyada mukammal
 It is the filter through which i see the goals of design i
e
 creativity, artistry and comfort
 lagjri sidhi-saadi, magar jajbaat jagaane vaali hoti he
 It is the original excellence and fine craftsmanship carved from the most pure and unmatched diamonds
 ''2010 main jab vah julri bana rahaa tha, uske kachche diginon par nilaameeghar christies ke julri pramukh kii parkhi nazren padin
 Christies picked her Golconda Lotus necklace for the 2010 auction and placed it on the front page of her catalog — never before, and Modi became the first Indian to be honored with this honor
 uske baad usne heere ke teen anuthe pattern patent karwaae—ek, jisamen hiron kaa ek aabhamandal banaaya gaya tha, doosraa, jisamen heere kadigoon kaa kaam karte the or teesraa, jisamen hiron kii pankhudi banaai gai thi
 He began to build an empire that had spread across all continents — this was not an easy feat, especially when no other Indian jewelery brand had managed to spread its footprint around the world
 modi apane brands kii ek-ek baarik baat kaa khud khyaal rakhata tha
 He said, "every aspect of the business — designing, production and their commercial performance — is done in-house because i want complete control over quality
 ''uski nijee jindagi kabhi saarvajanik daayre main nahin rahi
 The wife of 42-year-old Amy Modi was raised in New York and after her marriage, she moved to Mumbai and stood with him forever
 modi parivaar ke saath aksar milane vaale ek shaks ke mutabik, vah mumbai kii oonchi or rasukhdaar socity main gaharaai se rachaa-basaa tha, lekin upar se chakachaundh se dur hi rahata tha
 Her brother Neeshal Modi married Ishita Salgaonkar, niece of Anil and Mukesh Ambani
 neerav or uski patni ko ruia parivaar (essar samooh) ke bhi kareeb bataaya jaataa he
 All three of his children were educated at the same Dhirubhai Ambani school in Mumbai, where many industrialists and children of stars study
 haalanki pichley saal unhen is skool se nikaalkar neuyork ke ek skool main daal diya gaya tha
 This was perhaps a sign that Modi had realized the decisive reach of things and wanted to take his family away from Mumbai to a safe area
 brands neerav modiusake aabhushanon kii khaasiyat thi ki unamem behtareen kism ke heere kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha, unamem gajab kii khubsuurati hoti thi or dhaatu kaa istemaal kam se kam kiya jaataa tha
 Apart from this, Modi's emphasis was that his jewelery should be completely comfortable
 uske kaarkaane ke pramukh peter majur ek vakya yaad karte hue bataate hai, jisamen modi ne ek mahila ko ek aabhushan puure din pahanaaya jo uske paas manjuuri ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 He wanted to know whether the woman did not feel any problem while wearing her work
 laajabaav saundaryabodh ke baavjood modi ko rekhachitr bananaa nahin aata he
 Then how did he design without any visual reference? Once in an interview to India Today, he said, "I keep my point very clear and in detail, and most of the people in my design team have long Because of working together, i understand before i finish
 ''jahaan tak prerana lene kaa maamla he to iske dheron strot rahe hai—yatraaon main dekhe gaye belboote, kala or kavita ke prati lagaav, yahaan tak ki darshanik vichaar jaise amoort strot bhi
 For example, he once asked his team to design a collection of lotus flowers that looked like a lily in Monet's painting
 ''maine apni team se kaha ki jis tarah maaikel angelo kii murti david main kahin koi dosha nahin he, usee tarah hamaare aabhushanon main koi kami nahin honi chahie
 If there is any deficiency in us, then spoil it and rebuild it again
 ''ek baar usne kaha tha, ''main khushkismat rahaa hum ki bachapan se mujhe behtareen chijen dekhne kaa mauka mila he, jaise kala or vaastushilp—16veen sadi kii rubence kii paintingon se lekar aadhunik samay ke fishan dizinron jaise antwork sicks se lekar mughal kaal ke kuch behtareen vaastushilp
 All of this gave me a lot of inspiration, due to which i have traveled around the world and i also learned a lot from these trips
 ''sitaron kaa saathmodi ne 2014 main nai dilli kii dephence colony main apana pehla store kholaa tha or unka samrajya teji se badhata gaya jisamen neuyork ke medisson scawair main ek bhavy store, honkong main chaar store, macau main ek store (jo abhi haal hi main pichley hafte khulaa tha), 2017 main landan ke old bond street main ek store shaamil the
 Thus, in just five years, 14 stores opened in Delhi, Mumbai, Hong Kong, Macau, New York, London, Beijing, Singapore, Las Vegas and Hawaii
 modi ne kaha, ''ham 2025 tak duniya bhar main 100 store kholane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 "his brand is the only brand in India that compares well with the world's leading brands such as Karthiye, Van Cleef & Arpels and Harry Winston
" usne 2016 main paris main binel des antikuires kala meley main apane aabhushanon kii pradarshnee kii thi
 The proof of his increasing fame shows that rich and famous people started wearing his jewelery at big events
 hollywood abhinetri ket vincellet ne 2016 ke auskar puraskaron ke samay uske aabhushan pahane the
 Also Dakota Johnson, Naomi Watts, Coco Rocha and Taraji P
 hension ne bhi uske aabhushanon kii shaan badhaai thi
 Several international models have advertised Nirav's jewelery, including Rosie huntington-whiteley, who wore the jewelery at the opening of Modi's store in Madison Avenue in 2017
 model lija heden ne uske gahanon kaa vigyaapan kiya tha, jo pashchim or purab kaa behtareen mishran tha
 In 2017, Priyanka Chopra became her brand ambassador and was adorned in her jewelery on billboards and television
 unke saath abhinayta siddharth malhotra bhi hote the
 It is said that Sharon Stone had come to Modi's studio in Mumbai and many Bollywood actresses were her regular customers
 uski khyaati ko dekhte hue yah koi aashcharya kii baat nahin thi ki 2017 main dilli main prince of wales se milane ke liye use aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Level of service: Modi laid great emphasis on maintaining a different level of service
 aap mumbai, neuyork yaa honkong ke unke kisi bhi store par jaaen, jahaan uskaa staff sthaneey hota tha, lekin aapako ek jaisaa anubhav milegaa
 When the first store opened, Modi said, "if you like chocolate, you will be offered the best type of chocolate, whether you are a customer or not
 aapako 300 kism kii chaay main se aapaki pasand kii chaay di jaaegi or har chaay ko banane kaa ek alag tarika hoga
 Modi did not mind that after working all day in London, he rode a motorbike on a rental to reach a dinner meeting in Paris
 motorbike ke shaukeen modi ko fast len par bike bhagaanaa pasand tha, chaahe vah sadak ho yaa vaastavik jindagi
 But it seems, this hobby of rakratar cost him dearly
 lagjri brands ke ek salaahkaar ke mutabik, ''neerav modi kaa sapana bharat kaa kartie bananaa tha
 But such controversy would be disastrous for his brand
 use apni saakh bachaani hogi

 pichley das dinon main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne teen badi niyuktiyaan kii hai
 Anil Sinha on the post of a CBI Director, Dineshwar Sharma on the post of IB Chief and Vivek Srivastava on the post of SPG Chief
 anil sinha jahaan bihar cader ke police adhikari hai, vahiin dineshwar sharma kerala cader ke or vivek gujarat cader ke, lekin in teenon adhikariyon main ek samanta he or vah he in sab kaa paitruk rajya bihar hona
 Dineshwar Sharma, however, never worked in Bihar
 vah enese ajit dobhaal ke kareeb maane jate hai
 His style of work also largely follows the formula and principle of Doval
 vahiin anil sinha ke bare main tay hai ki jab tak vah sibiai nideshak ke pad par rahenge, modi sarkaar ke sabhi hiton kaa khyal rakhenge or apane purv ke bos ranjit sinha kii galatiyon ko nahin doharaaenge
 But the most question is being raised in the minds of people regarding the appointment of Vivek Srivastava by SP Modi as SPG Director, because Vivek is an officer of 89 batch and he does not have much experience in terms of experience
 jaankaron kii maane to centre sarakar ne anubhav or batch se zyada haal ke dinon main adhikariyon ke pradarshan ko tarjeeh di he, jahaan vivek apane sabhi shortlysted anya adhikariyon par baari paden
 In fact, Vivek had not only served five years in the SPG as a DIG, but in recent years, he was instrumental in arresting Yasin Bhatkal, the largest terrorist of the Indian Mujahideen, as the Joint Director of the IB of Bihar- Jharkhand
 iske alaava unhone hi yah bhi bataaya ki bodh gaya blast main indian mujahidin kaa hi haath he or pichley saal narendra modi kii patna raily main hue bam visphot kii ashanka ke bare main bhi unhone rajya sarkaar ko pehle hi alert kar diya tha
 Within six months after the bombings, he, along with the NIA, played a key role in arresting several accused of Indian Mujahideen
 modi bhi jaanate hai kii vivek jab gujarat main posted the, tab ek band ke dauraan bijepi sansad ko giraftaar karne main unhone koi hichak nahin dikhaai thi, isliye modi jinhen khud ke upar kai tarah ke threat kii jaankaree hai, unhen maaloom hai ki aisi paristhiti main shaayad vivek se behatar adhikari nahin milegaa jo suraksha ke maamle main unki baton ko bhi nayindaz karne main bhi shaayad hichake nahin
 Ajay Singh, husband of Parliamentarian Kavita Singh, who won the independent candidate from Daronda in Bihar, was from JDU, and the assembly elections in Haryana and Maharashtra have also resulted in the by-elections in 5 seats in Bihar
 in paanchon vidhansabha siton main se ek seat par eimm ke pratyaashee, do siton par rajd or ek seat par nirdaleey pratyaashee vijayi hue hai

 koun si he wo sitis seat kaa naam darunda he
 This assembly falls in the famous district of Siwan parliamentary constituency of Bihar

 At the same time, RJD made Umesh Singh a candidate
 lekin in donon ko maat dete hue nirdaleey pratyaashee karanjit urf vyas singh ne baaji maar lee
 Vyas Singh is the rebel leader of the BJP who won the election independently
 bijepi ke purv saansad bhi virodh mereham baat yah he ki vyas singh ko bijepi ke purv saansad omprakash yadav kaa bhi samarthan tha
 He openly campaigned for Independent Vyas Singh and appealed to defeat Ajay Singh of JDU
 yahaan bataa den ki omprakash yadav abhi siwan main bijepi ke sabase bade netaa hai
 During the election campaign in Daronda, there was a split between BJP and JDU
 purv saansad omprakash yadav samet anya kai bijepi netaa jediu ke ummidavaar ajay singh kaa khulkar virodh kar rahe the
 There was a fierce battle between BJP and JDU leaders
 bijepi ke sthaneey netaaon kaa kahana tha ki ajay singh apradhi chhavi ke hai or jediu endie gathbandhan kaa dharm nahin nibhaa rahi he
 Allegations on BJP high command Many local BJP leaders also alleged that the party high command has bowed down to JDU
 vahiin bihar bijepi ke bade netaaon main shumaar susheel modi or mangal pandey ne ajay singh ke liye chunaav prachaar kiya
 Not only this, bjp's rebel candidate Vyas Singh was also expelled from the party
 isse pehle chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din darunda pahunche susheel modi ne manch se kadi chetavanee di thi ki agar vyas singh ne namakan waapas nahin liya to unhen kadi sajaa denge
 Despite the strictness of the BJP high command, opposition from local leaders of the party continued
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki vyas singh ko jeet mili to vahiin jediu ummidavaar ajay singh haar gaye
 Ajay Singh Ajay Singh Siwan is the biggest leader of JDU
 iske saath hi siwan kii vartmaan saansad kavita singh ke pati bhi hai
 Ajmay Singh's mother Jagamato Devi was also a long-time MLA
 saal 2011 main jagamaato devi ke nidhan ke baad darunda seat par upachunaav hua tha
 Then JDU did not give ticket to Ajay Singh as he had many criminal cases registered
 iske baad pitrupaksh main hi ajay singh ne kavita singh se shaadi kii or party ne unhen chunavi maidan main utaara
 Kavita Singh also won the 2015 assembly election

 When Asaram's lawyer requested for an early hearing on his client's bail plea, the judges said, "can there be different grounds for prisoners?" First let your medical report come

 The court said that his petition would be heard in January after the winter vacation
 supreme court ne 15 oktober ko ames ke nideshak ko asaram kii medical report kii samiksha ke liye medical board gathit karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The court also said that if needed, his medical test should be done to determine whether he should be granted interim bail in the Jodhpur rape case

 That one night 13 years ago
 
 
 salmaan khanki naa jane kitni raaton kii neenden uda chuki he or aaj bhi uda rahi he
 Same night
 
 Which sometimes hit the headlines in the name of hit and run and sometimes in the form of non-intentional killing
 vahi raat
 
 jisamen kabhi salmaan gaadi kii driving seat se utarate bhi dikhe or kabhi gaayab bhi
 Salman Khan, who came out to cover the distance of about five kilometers in that one night, has not been able to reach the floor of peace even after 13 years, but now the case is going to get his floor on May 6 at exactly eleven in the morning
 kariyar ke sabase sunahare daur se guzar rahesalmaan khanmitti ko bhi chhu de to sona ban jaati he
 Salman Khan, who has made a series of films earning over a hundred crores
 magar mukaddar ke is sikandar kii takadir kabhi ek jaisi nahin rahi
 Both fame and trouble clung to Salman like a twin
 hit and ran cese kaa bhoot pichley 13 saalon se salmaan kaa peechha kar rahaa he or jo unhen baar-baar filmi set ke baahar asli adaalat main is tarah haazir hone ko majaboor karata he
 Salmanka's stature was still much larger than the 70 mm screen on which she was the big star of the big screen but by the time she was a big star, she had also achieved the title of Bollywood's big spoiler
 'ham dil de chuke sanam' kii superhit kamyaabi or mohabbat or nafrat ke bich aishwarya raay ke naam 'tadap-tadap ke is dil se aah nikalati rahi alaap' ke darmyaan salmaan khan apane kagin kamaal khan ke saath raat saadhe nau baje ghar se nikalate hai
 Outside stood his bodyguard and Mumbai Police constable Ravindra Patil
 kamaal, patil ko bataate hai ki rain baar, juhu chalanaa he
 According to Ravindra Patil's statement to the police, a white colored Toyota Land Cruiser car drives by itself and then the three reach Juhu
 rain baar ke manager rigwan rakhaangi ke mutabik us raat baar main bahut saare celebrities the
 In Salman's hand he saw a glass of white color, which had something resembling white liquid
 rigwan ke mutabik salmaan or unke doston ne foster bear, cosmopotilan cocktail, white bacardi ram or snacks ke order die the, jiskaa kul bill kareeb das hajaar rupye tha
 After leaving the Rain Bar, Saman goes to the Hotel JW Marriott for a while and then the three go home late at night
 raat teen baje ke baad salmaan party se baahar nikalate hai
 The government lawyer says that he was drunk, but Salman Khan says that he only drank water in the bar that night
 ghar jane ke liye unke paas us raat safed rang kii toyta land kruger gaadi thi
 Along with driving the bodyguard less driver
 salmaan kii gaadi raat ke andhere main kareeb teen baje bandra ke hill road par pahunchati he
 
 gaadi kii raftaar behad tej thi
 So, shortly before the American Express Bakery on Hill Road, the driver suddenly loses the balance of the vehicle and in a moment the car leaves the road from the left side and starts running on the pavement
 badanasibi se us vakt usee footpath par american express bekri main kaam karne vaale paanch karmchaaree so rahe the
 The high speed land cruiser overtakes the five and then stops the car after hitting the shutter of the shop
 police ke mutabik haadase ke baad salmaan khan achaanak ghabara jate hai
 By then, the rest of the people sleeping around also wake up after hitting the pavement of the car and hearing the shouts of the injured
 log gaadi ke neeche fanse logon ko baahar nikaalte hai or unhen aspataal le jaaya jaataa he
 After some time, Salman leaves the vehicle on the spot and disappears, but even with a 70 mm screen, a glimpse of his height is enough to identify him
 bhaagane se pehle salmaan ko kai log pahchaan chuke the
 In the accident, one worker dies almost on the spot, while four workers are badly injured
 chaaron main se zyaadaatar ke pair ko gaadi ne rond daalaa tha
 Niamat Sheikh, one of the four injured, had initially told the police that he was sleeping at the time of the accident
 tabhi jor kii aawaaj ke saath uske baayen pair par kuch vajani cheez chadhi jisase uski aankh khul gai
 Sheikh said that he saw Salman Khan coming down from the driver's seat at the right door of the car
 magar baad main magistrate court main shaikh ne kaha ki usne driver kii seat se salmaan ko utarate nahin dekha tha
 Before this incident, Salman Khan had made headlines for his anger with the blackbuck victim and Aishwarya Rai, so it was not too late to spread the news of this incident
 salmaan haadase ke baad maukey se gaayab ho chuke the
 When police reached home, they did not meet at home either, but Salman
 
 
 
 Salman Khan was hard to hide
 lihaaja kareeb aath ghante baad wo khud saamne aa jate hai
 By morning, the news was spread all over Mumbai
 salmaan khan ke daaman par ek or daag lag chukaa tha par haadase ke baad se khud salmaan gaayab the
 The car's number and the eyewitness had chugged against Salman
 lihaaza subah-subah police salmaan ke ghar pahunchati he lekin salmaan ghar par nahin the
 Actually Salman Khan wanted some time for legal advice
 isiilie wo gaayab the
 He knew that running too late could cause difficulties
 jamaanat milane main dikkat aegi
 So, about eight hours after the accident, he himself comes forward and finally the Bandra police arrest him
 giraftaar ke baad salmaan ko jeje aspataal le jaaya jaataa he, jahaan salmaan kaa blad sample liya jaataa he
 The police register a case of negligence and dangerous driving against Salman
 gairajamaanti dhara ke chalate giraftaar ke kuch der baad hi unhen mahaj 950 rupye ke jurmaane ke saath jamaanat par reeha bhi kar diya jaataa he
 Some social organizations protest against Salman's release so easily and reach court on 5 October 2002
 wo adaalat main salmaan ke khilaaf ek janhit yachika daakhil kar salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa darj karne kii maang karte hai
 The court not only accepts the plea, but also orders the police to file a case against Salman under Section 304-2 of the IPC, ie culpable homicide not amounting to murder
 iske tahat adhiktam sajaa das saal kaid he
 On 7 October 2002, police arrest Salman again for culpable homicide not amounting to a court order
 salmaan jail chale jate hai
 They remain in jail for the entire 18 days
 is dauraan wo chaar baar jamaanat kii arji dete hai
 But the bail application is rejected four times
 phir aakhirkaar 18 din baad 24 aktubar 2002 ko salmaan ko jamaanat mil jaati he or wo reeha ho jate hai
 After his release, Salman Khanmarch challenges the decision to file a non-accidental murder case against him in 2003 Mumbai Sessions Court
 lekin do maheene ke andar hi may 2003 main seshans court naa sirf unki arji ko khaarij kar detii he balki magistrate court ko salmaan ke khilaaf chargeshit taiyaar karne kaa hukum suna detii he
 However, Salman continued the legal battle
 khud par lage gaiyr iradatan hatya kii dhara hatwane ke liye wo seshans court ke faisle ko ab bombai hai court main chunauti dete hai
 In this case Salman gets first relief here
 bombai hai court ipisi kii dhara 304-II hataa detii he
 The court said that this section does not fit in this case
 salmaan ke hisse ye khushi behad kam vakt ke liye ai
 Because the Maharashtra government reached the Supreme Court in October 2003 against the Bombay High Court verdict
 uski daleel thi ki maamla gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa hi banataa he
 Salman Khan received the biggest blow from the Supreme Court in December 2003 after a two-month wait
 supim court ne bombai hai court ke faisle ko patalte hue kaha ki salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa chale yaa naa chale iskaa faisla magistrate court karegi
 Now that the Magistrate Court had already ordered the police to file a charge sheet against Salman under Section 304-2 of the IPC, the bus trial was yet to begin
 mumbai police salmaan khan ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 304(II) ke alaava motor vical act 1988 or bombai prohibeshan act 1949 ke tahat dhara 279, 337, 338 or 427 ke adheen mukadmaa darj kar leti he
 Four big charges against Salman Khan are made in the charge sheet
 pehla, haadase ke vakt salmaan khan hi toeta land kruger car chalaa rahe the
 Second, Salman's car was extremely fast
 teesraa, haadase ke baad salmaan maukey se bhaag gaye the
 And fourth that night Salman had drunk more than normal amount
 inamen se zyaadaatar iljaam salmaan ke suraksha guard or mumbai police ke sipaahi rabindra patil ke bayaan ke aadhaar par hi lagaae gaye the
 Patil was the first to give a statement to the police that Salman was drunk after leaving the bar and was driving the same vehicle even after he refused
 or gaadi kii raftaar bhi kareeb 90 se 100 kilomir prati ghanta thi
 Ravindra Patil was an important eyewitness in this case
 ji haa
 Was
 kyonki patil kii teen aktubar 2007 ko maut ho chuki he
 Ravindra Patil was a constable in the Mumbai Police
 usne haadase ke baad police ko jo bayaan diya tha uske mutabik us raat wo car main salmaan khan ke baraabar main baitha hua tha
 The court considered Patil's statement to be an important part of the case even after his death
 magar salmaan khan kii taraf se court main kaha gaya ki jis raat haadasa hua tha rabindra patil puure raste car main so rahaa tha
 He did not know anything
 rabindra patil ne apane pehle bayaan main police ko ye bhi nahin kaha tha ki haadase vaali raat salmaan nashe main the
 Rather, he said this after four months
 chargeshit daakhil hone ke baad mukadmaa court main chalata rahaa
 During this time there are several turns in the case
 sabase pehle salmaan kii taraf se kaha jaataa he ki us raat wo gaadi chalaa hi nahin rahe the
 Rather, his driver was driving Ashok Singh
 salmaan ne sharaab pine kii baat se bhi inkaar kiya
 Also accused that his blood sample was deliberately changed
 jeje aspataal ke doctor shashikant pavaarane shuruuaati bayaan main kaha tha ki salmaan ne pehle apana blad sample dene se manaa kar diya tha
 But there was a smell of alcohol in his mouth
 baad main magistrate ke saamne doctor shashikant ne kaha ki ye kahana mushkil he ki salmaan ke munh se bu sharaab kii hi aa rahi thi
 As far as the blood sample was concerned, Salman's lawyer said that the sample has been tampered with
 daleel ye di gai ki us din do alag-alag blad sample kii shishi lab bheji gai thi par un par naam kaa chit nahin laga tha
 a total of 28 witnesses appeared in this case
 inamen se sirf ek gavaah salmaan khan kii taraf se tha
 Driver Ashok Singh
 baaki 27 gavaahon ne abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se salmaan ke khilaaf gavaahi di
 Many of these witnesses were those who overturned the statement given to the police in court
 trial ke dauraan mumbai police ne adaalat main salmaan khan ke khilaaf kul 27 gavaah pesh kiye
 While only one witness appeared on behalf of Salman
 salmaan kaa driver ashok singh
 Those are 27 witnesses who appeared against Salman

 Ashok Singh - Salman Khan's driver and only witness from the defense side The most important and shocking turn of this case came when the debate and arguments in the court was now going to end
 tabhi bees april 2015 ko achaanak adaalat main ashok singh naam kaa ek shaks pahunchataa he
 He describes himself as the driver of Salman Khan and his father Salim Khan
 ashok singh ke adaalat main die bayaan ke mutabik wo 1990 se khan parivaar kaa driver he
 Ashok Singh said that on the night of September 28, he was driving, not the land cruiser Salman Khan
 'ghatana vaali raat hi police ko sabakuch bataa diya'is par jab adaalat ne usase poocha ki ye baat 13 saal baad ab kyon bataa rahaa he to ashok singh kaa kahana tha ki us raat car kaa ek pahiyaa fat gaya tha, jisaki vajah se gaadi kaa santulan bighad gaya or wo footpath par chadh gaya
 After that Salman called the police on number 100 that night
 phir vahaan se wo bandra police thane gaya, jahaan wo chaar baje subah tak rukaa rahaa
 And that night, he told the police everything
 salmaan khan us raat car kii driving seat se utre the yaa nahin ye is cese ke liye ek ahm sawaal tha
 The Mumbai Police has mentioned in the charge sheet that Salman Khan had come down from the right door of the car i
e
 the driving seat that night
 jabaki salmaan ke vakil ne adaalat main kaha ki haadase ke baad car kaa pichhlaa darwaja jam ho gaya tha
 That is why Salman had to descend from the front
 trial ke dauraan salmaan khan se adaalat ne kul 419 sawaal puche the
 The questions varied of course
 par salmaan khan aakhir tak adaalat ko yahi yakeen dilaate rahe ki us raat naa to unhone sharaab pi thi
 Neither he was driving nor any accident happened at his hands
 kyonki gaadi unka driver ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha
 Now the last debate of 13 long years with the same Ashok Singh, the last testimony has been completed

 Former Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh said on Saturday that his party will not field its candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli seats, which are considered to be Congress strongholds, in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh
 singh ne yahaan ek jansabha main kaha, ‘‘main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa shukraguzaar hum kyonki unhone meri beemaari ke vakt meri khariyat poochi thi
 My party has decided that it will not field its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 ’’ samaajawaadee party par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, ‘‘mujhe baahar nikaale jane ke baad sapa ek pahiye kii cycle ho gayi he jo aksar sarkas main dikhaai detii he
 Singh said that SP and Bahujan Samaj Party are two sides of the same coin
 uttar pradesh ke mainpuri police ne buudhvaar ko ekafarji iasko giraftaar kiya he
 Accused Suresh Kumar used to call himself DM of Banda district and used to swindle the job
 is farji dm ke khilaaf lakhon rupee kii thagi kaa aarope he
 According to the information received from the police, after completing msc studies, accused Suresh Kumar alias SK Singh was preparing for UPSC
 maamla thana elau ilaake ke bhaamvat gaanv se judaa he
 Prabhudayal, who lives here, works as a contractor in Dwarka, Delhi
 farji adhikarise prabhu dayaal kii mulaakaat haryana ke bahadurpur main hui thi
 At that time, SK Singh called himself a PCS officer and was a city magistrate
 prabhudayal ne anusaar, disambar 2014 main esake singh ne bataaya ki vah upi cader kaiees adhikariban gaya he or banda janapad main padasth he
 Interestingly, the real DM posted in Banda district is also Suresh Kumar
 aarope he ki naam kaa phayda uthaakar farji dm suresh kumaar ne janvari maheene main prabhu dayaal ko phone par bataaya ki unke yahaan do chaparasi ke pad rikt hai or vah naukari lagava sakate hai
 For this, the accused demanded money at the rate of two lakh rupees per post
 prabhu dayaal ne do lakh rupee farji adhikari ke khate main daal bhi die
 In February, the fake officer once again called and talked about another vacant post, in lieu of which 50 thousand rupees and account were deposited
 milane gaye to khulaa bhedabataya jaataa he ki is bich prabhudayal suresh kumaar se milane banda pahunche, lekin dm offis pahunchate hi sara bhed khul gaya
 As soon as he understood the reality, Prabhudayal called the fake DM, to which he said that he was on leave
 fansaane ke liye bichaaya jalprabhudayal ke mutabik, farji dm ko fansane or police ke hawaale karne ke liye unhone esake singh ko bataaya ki vah apane gaanv mainpuri ke bhaamvat aae hue hai or yahaan kuch rupee icttha ho gaye hai
 Frauded for money, DMSK Singh reached the village, which was caught by Prabhudayal and handed over to the police
 pakade gaye farji dm ne poochtacha main bataaya ki vah jonpur kaa rahane vaala bataaya he
 Police suspect that many more people may be associated with it
 police sambandhit anya thagi ke maamalon kii bhi poochtacha kar rahi he
 SP of Mainpuri Shrikant Singh Yadav said that Suresh Kumar of Jaunpur was recovering money in the name of getting people to work as fake dms

 The Muslim face of the Samajwadi Party, Azam Khan, used the trump card 17 years ago to beat his biggest political enemy Noor Bano in the politics of Rampur
 aaj jab usee turup ke pattey ko bijepi ne unheen ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utaar diya he to ajam khan unke khilaaf badjubaani par utar aae hai or sari simaane paar kar di hai
 Regarding Azam Khan's latest remarks, Jaya Prada has said that this time he has exceeded the limit
 jaya pradaa ne kaha ki ab meri kshamta khatm ho gai he or ajam khan ne itani dushmani paidaa kar di he ki ab wo bhai kya, mere kuch nahin bache hai
 The feud between the two leaders is not today, but the gap of enmity arose long ago
 is adaavat ko rampur ke log 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dekh chuke hai
 In fact, despite Azam Khan's opposition, Jaya Prada contested the 2009 election from Rampur Lok Sabha seat on Mulayam Singh Yadav's SP ticket
 ajam khan isse naaraaz ho gaye or unhone party line ke khilaaf jaakar jaya pradaa kaa purajor virodh kiya
 However, he could not succeed in defeating Jaya Prada, but the rivalry between the two became a matter of discussion everywhere
 yahaan tak ki sapa se ajam khan kaa saath bhi chhot gaya or unhen nishkasit kar diya gaya
 There were also allegations of distributing pornographic images of Jaya Prada in Rampur
 ab chunaav prachaar main jaya pradaa khud yah daawa kar rahi hai ki ajam khan kuch bhi kar sakate hai or mujhe badnaam karne ke liye meri ashleel photographs failaai gayi
 However, former SP leader Amar Singh is believed to be the major reason for the dispute between Azam Khan and Jaya Prada
 sapa ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav or amar singh behad kareebi rahe hai
 At the behest of Amar Singh in 2004, it was Azam Khan who made Jaya Prada contest the Lok Sabha elections from Rampur, in which she won
 lekin jald amar singh or ajam khan ke rishton main ai khatas kaa asar jaya pradaa or ajam khan ke bich dikhaai dene laga
 When SP was given a ticket to Jaya Prada again in 2009, Azam Khan became angry and he opposed Jaya Prada from ticket to contest elections
 donon netaaon ke bich bayaanbajidonon netaaon ke bich kii naaraazgi unke bayanon main bhi aksar dekhne ko milti rahi he
 Jaya Prada compared Azam Khan to the villain shown as Khilji in the film Padmavat in the year 2018 before the election
 ajam khan bhi jaya pradaa ko nachaniya kahkar aksar unki aalochana karte rahe
 Even Jaya Prada has been critical of Azam Khan's behavior, crying from the public stage
 ab jabaki donon 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav aamane-saamne lard rahe hai to bayaanbaji kaa ye daur seemaa paar karne laga he
 Jaya Prada is accusing Azam Khan of sharing her pornographic photos while referring to 2009 in the election campaign
 ajam khan ne to undervier tak ko lekar tippanee kar di he, jise lekar har taraf se unki aalochana ho rahi he

 This has been revealed in ndtv's investigation
 padtaal main pataa chalaa he ki sarkaar ne 2014 se 2018 ke bich kul 7 baar aisa karne kii koshish
 Private firm was also approached for this
 isi saal may me ai media reports ke anusaar sarkaar ne 25 april 2018 ko ek aisa hi tender nikaala tha jise supreme court ke hastekshep ke baad radd kar diya gaya
 a similar effort by the Unique Identification Authority of India to monitor social media came to the fore on 18 July 2018
 haalanki is koshish ko bhi supreme court ne nakaar diya
 The first hearing of the case has been completed on this Friday
 gauratlab he ki enditivi ne apni jaanch main paaya ki is tarah ke form se centre sarkaar ne 2014 main satta main aane ke baad hi sampark karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The first tender was taken out on 1 December 2014
 yah tender videsh mantralay ne jari kiya tha
 And with this, there was also talk of making a special media monitoring folder
 jabaki doosraa tender 3 disambar 2015 ko nikaala gaya
 This time the tender was released by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 isamen vyaktigat soshal media account or yujar kii monitering karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting subsequently issued two more tenders
 pehla tender 5 farvari 2016 or doosraa 10 july 2017 ko jari kiya gaya
 The tender released in the tender on 5 February while the 10 July tender was said to track all the ongoing trends on social media
 tippaniyan Whereas the tender negative sentiments of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued on 16 May 2016 were asked to neutralize
 khaas baat yah he ki jab enditivi ne in tender ko lekar soochna evam prasaaran mantralay se sampark kiya to mantralay ke media and communication divijan ke dipti diarector arun kumaar ne kaha ki ham aapke sawaalon ko varisht adhikariyon tak pahunchaa denge or agar unhone in sawaalon par koi jawaab diya to isaki soochna aapako de di jaaegi
 Experts say that although now the government has backfired but even then it cannot be denied that the government tried to spy people on a large scale
 internet policy kii jaankaar amba kaak ne kaha ki is tarah kaa ek upkaran nishchit rup se sabhi ke soshal media khaaton kaa surveykshan karata he, lekin do bade prashn hai
 The first is how he would do it

 If he had done so, he would surely have violated the rules of social media service
 unic aaidentification othirity of india dwaara soshal media ko monitor karne ke liye isi tarah ke ek prayaas 18 july 2018 ko sabhi ke saamne aayaa
 However, this attempt was also rejected by the Supreme Court
 is maamle kii pehali sunwaayee isi shuukravaar ko puri gai gai he
 Significantly, NDTV found in its investigation that such firm started contacting the Central Government only after coming to power in 2014
 ise lekar pehla tender 1 disambar 2014 ko nikaala gaya
 This tender was issued by the Ministry of External Affairs
 or iske saath hi special media monitering foulder banane kii bhi baat kahi gai thi
 While the second tender was withdrawn on 3 December 2015
 is baar tender soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne jari kiya tha
 It asked to monitor personal social media accounts and users
 isi soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne aage chalakar do or tender jari kiye
 The first tender was released on 5 February 2016 and the second on 10 July 2017
 5 farvari ko jari kiye gaye tender main lisning tul jabaki 10 july ke tender main soshal media par chal rahe over ol trends ko trek karne kii baat kahi gai
 The comments jabaki 16 may 2016 ko jari soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ke tender negative centiments ko neutrlij karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The special thing is that when NDTV approached the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting regarding these tenders, Arun Kumar, deputy director of the media and communication division of the ministry said that we will forward your questions to senior officials and if they have any questions on these questions If given the answer, it will be given to you
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki haalanki ab sarkaar khudako peeche kar liya he lekin iske baavjood bhi is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki sarkaan ne bade str par logon kii jasusi karaane kii koshish kii

 In this case, Patna SSP Manu Maharaj said that no case was reported on behalf of the family about the missing or kidnapping of the girl

 Two people have been arrested and the accused father and the four remaining in the car are being searched
 is hafte release hui he 'teen', jiskaa nirdesan kiya he ribhu dasgupta ne or iske kai nirmaataaon main se ek hai sujoy ghosh
 
 
 Talking about Starcast, the film has Amitabh Bachchan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vidya Balan and Sabyasachi Chakraborty
 
 
 kahani ke bare main zyaada baat nahin karuunga, kyonki film main suspence bhi he, jo khul saktaa he, or main aapkaa mazaa karaab nahin karnaa chahta
 
 
 So, i will only tell that this is the story of John Biswas, who has not forgotten the kidnapping of his granddaughter, eight years ago and is still looking for the criminal who kidnapped him
 
 
 film main jon vishwaas ke kirdaar main hai amitabh bachchan, fadar martin ke kirdaar main nawaz, vidya baalan nibhaa rahi hai inspector sarita kaa kirdaar or manohar bane hai sabyasachi chakravarti
 
 
 Some special things before telling the film's shortcomings and features
 
 
 film kii release se do din pehle, yani buudhvaar ko film aalochakon ko dikhaa di gai or agle din brihaspativaar ko nirdeshak ribhu or abhinayta amitabh bachchan ek choti-si sabha main patrkaar or aalochakon se mukhaatib hue, jisamen amitabh ne kaha ki sabha ke peeche unki manshaa sirf yah he ki unhen or filmkaaron ko unki kaamiyaan pataa lag saken, taaki bhavishya main ve inhen sudhaar saken
 
 
 At the same time, they can also know the attitude of critics how they rate a film, so that with the help of it, they can improve their work in the future
 
 
 sabha main main bhi shaamil tha
 
 
 i would call it a bold initiative, even though some people call it a new way of publicity, because no actor or filmmaker wants to face their criticisms after the film is shown and listen to the flaws at all, but here Big b and the director Ribhu also heard praises and flaws, and explained some things that people did not understand
 
 
 to pehle to team ke is kadam ke liye unhen badhai
 
 
 Now i will talk about the flaws, the flaws that were put in front of this meeting
 
 
 inamen se kuch ke saath main sahamat hum, or kuch ke saath nahin
 
 
 So this is the flaw placed in front of that assembly
 
 
 bataur thriller, kuch logon ko film kii gati dhimi lagi
 
 
 Some people did not understand the relationship of Amitabh Bachchan and Nawaz in the film, or there was a question mark on it
 
 
 kuch ko laga, amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha or film main itnaa tamzam sirf film ko gadhane ke liye kiya gaya yaa suvidhanusaar kiya gaya
 
 
 Some said, who is guilty in the film should have already guessed after the second kidnapping, and confessed his crime
 
 
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki ve bataur darshak film main lipt nahin ho paae
 
 
 Those who have not seen the film will not understand these things, and i myself am speaking very sparingly that suspense does not open
 
 
 khayr ye thi ve kaamiyaan jinka zikr sabha main hua, lekin in sabhi baton se main ittefaq nahin rakhata, sivaay ek ke
 
 
 That is - if the character of Amitabh Bachchan had wanted, the story could have been reached in advance, or the police could have taken help
 
 
 iske alaava ek or kaami jo mujhe lagi - film kaa kirdaar manohar jab-jab phiroti ke liye phone sunata he, to vah awaz kyon nahin pahchaan paata
 
 
 So according to me, these were flaws and now it is about the things, including those which were mentioned earlier in the meeting
 
 
 film main amitabh bachchan kaa kaam logon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa, or 'hatke' laga
 The editing of the film was amazing
 film ke gaanon ke bol or sangeet kaaphi acha laga
 The film's way of telling the story, that is, is amazing
 nawaz kaa kaam logon ko 'hatke' laga
 The comments mere hisaab se ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main, lekin main kuch or jodta hum
 
 
 i did not find the film slow and at the same time i was traveling with the story of the film and along with John Biswas i was also looking for the culprit
 
 
 film kaa screenple kaabil-e-taareef he or script bhi
 
 
 The film's cinematography adds to the mood of the film and the background score highlights the film's emotion
 
 
 or saath hi ribhu kaa niyantrit nirdesan
 
 
 So overall all these things are in the film and it is definitely a good film, so go and watch the film
 
 
 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars
 
 
 film kii kaamiyaan or kuubiyaan bataane se pehle kuch khaas baaten
 
 
 Two days before the release of the film, i
e
 on Wednesday, the film was shown to critics and the following day, on Thursday, director Ribhu and actor Amitabh Bachchan met journalists and critics in a small gathering, in which Amitabh said that his back of the gathering The only intention is that he and the filmmakers can find out their shortcomings, so that they can rectify them in future
 
 
 saath hi ve aalochakon kaa nazariyaa bhi jaan saken ki ve kisi film ko kis tarah aankate hai, taaki uski madad se ve bhavishya main apane kaam main sudhaar laa saken
 
 
 i was also involved in the meeting
 
 
 main to ise ek nirbhik pahal kahuunga, bhale hi kuch log ise prachaar kaa nayaa tarika kahen, kyonki film dikhaane ke baad koi bhi abhinayta yaa filmkaar apni aalochanaon kaa saamana nahin karnaa chahta or kaamiyaan to bilkul nahin sunanaa chahta, lekin yahaan big bi or nirdeshak ribhu ne tarifein bhi sunin or kaamiyaan bhi, or kuch baaten jo logon ko samaj nahin ain, unhe samajhaayaa bhi
 
 
 First of all, congratulations to the team on their move
 
 
 ab main baat karuunga kaamiyon kii, un khaamiyon kii, jo is sabha main saamne rakhi gayi
 
 
 i agree with some of these, and not with some
 
 
 to ye he us sabha main saamne rakhi gai kaamiyaan
 
 
 As a thriller, some people found the film slow
 
 
 kuch logon ko film main amitabh bachchan or nawaz kaa rishta samaj nahin aayaa, yaa us par ek sawalia nishaan tha
 
 
 Some felt that if Amitabh Bachchan's character wanted it, the story could have been carried out in advance and in the film, so much of the frills were done only to make the film or it was convenient
 
 
 kuch ne kaha, film main jo doshi he, use duusare apharan ke baad pehle hi anumaan ho janaa chahie tha, or apana gunaah kabool kar lenaa chahie tha
 
 
 Some believed that he could not indulge in the film as an audience
 
 
 jinhone film nahin dekhi, unhen ye bate samaj nahin aaengi, or vaise main bhi khud bahut bachakar bol rahaa hum ki kahin suspence na khul jaae
 
 
 Well these were the flaws mentioned in the meeting, but i do not agree with all these things, except one
 
 
 vah he - amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha, yaa police kii madad le saktaa tha
 
 
 Apart from this, there was another problem which i felt - when the character of the film, Manohar, hears the phone for ransom, why does he not recognize the voice
 
 
 to mere hisaab se ye thi kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii, jinamein pehle ve, jinka zikr sabha main hua
 
 
 People liked the work of Amitabh Bachchan in the film, and felt 'hatke'
 film kii editing kamaal kii lagi
 The lyrics and music of the film was very good
 film kaa kahani kehane kaa tarika, yani nerrative kamaal kaa he
 Nawaz's work was felt by the people as 'offending'
 tippaniyan i think these are all good qualities in the film, but i add something else
 
 
 mujhe film dhimi nahin lagi or saath hi main film kii kahani ke saath safar kar rahaa tha or jon vishwaas ke saath main bhi apradhi kii talash main tha
 
 
 The screenplay of the film is kaabil-e-praise and also the script
 
 
 film kii cinemotographi film ke mizaaj ko or umdaa karti he or saath hi becoground score film ke imoshan ko ujagar karata he
 
 
 And also the controlled direction of Ribhu
 
 
 to kul milakar ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main or yakeenan ek acchhee film he, to jaaie or film dekhie
 
 
 This film from my side 3
 5 star
 
 
 i was also involved in the meeting

 So this is the flaw placed in front of that assembly
 
 
 bataur thriller, kuch logon ko film kii gati dhimi lagi
 
 
 Some people did not understand the relationship of Amitabh Bachchan and Nawaz in the film, or there was a question mark on it
 
 
 kuch ko laga, amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha or film main itnaa tamzam sirf film ko gadhane ke liye kiya gaya yaa suvidhanusaar kiya gaya
 
 
 Some said, who is guilty in the film should have already guessed after the second kidnapping, and confessed his crime
 
 
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki ve bataur darshak film main lipt nahin ho paae
 
 
 Those who have not seen the film will not understand these things, and i myself am speaking very sparingly that suspense does not open
 
 
 khayr ye thi ve kaamiyaan jinka zikr sabha main hua, lekin in sabhi baton se main ittefaq nahin rakhata, sivaay ek ke
 
 
 That is - if the character of Amitabh Bachchan had wanted, the story could have been reached in advance, or the police could have taken help
 
 
 iske alaava ek or kaami jo mujhe lagi - film kaa kirdaar manohar jab-jab phiroti ke liye phone sunata he, to vah awaz kyon nahin pahchaan paata
 
 
 So according to me, these were flaws and now it is about the things, including those which were mentioned earlier in the meeting
 
 
 film main amitabh bachchan kaa kaam logon ko kaaphi pasand aayaa, or 'hatke' laga
 The editing of the film was amazing
 film ke gaanon ke bol or sangeet kaaphi acha laga
 The film's way of telling the story, that is, is amazing
 nawaz kaa kaam logon ko 'hatke' laga
 The comments mere hisaab se ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main, lekin main kuch or jodta hum
 
 
 i did not find the film slow and at the same time i was traveling with the story of the film and along with John Biswas i was also looking for the culprit
 
 
 film kaa screenple kaabil-e-taareef he or script bhi
 
 
 The film's cinematography adds to the mood of the film and the background score highlights the film's emotion
 
 
 or saath hi ribhu kaa niyantrit nirdesan
 
 
 So overall all these things are in the film and it is definitely a good film, so go and watch the film
 
 
 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars
 
 
 bataur thriller, kuch logon ko film kii gati dhimi lagi

 film kaa screenple kaabil-e-taareef he or script bhi

 meri taraf se is film ko 3
 5 stars
 
 
 jinhone film nahin dekhi, unhen ye bate samaj nahin aaengi, or vaise main bhi khud bahut bachakar bol rahaa hum ki kahin suspence na khul jaae
 
 
 Well these were the flaws mentioned in the meeting, but i do not agree with all these things, except one
 
 
 vah he - amitabh bachchan kaa kirdaar chahta to kahani ko pehle hi anjaam tak pahunchaa saktaa tha, yaa police kii madad le saktaa tha
 
 
 Apart from this, there was another problem which i felt - when the character of the film, Manohar, hears the phone for ransom, why does he not recognize the voice
 
 
 to mere hisaab se ye thi kaamiyaan or ab baat kuubiyon kii, jinamein pehle ve, jinka zikr sabha main hua
 
 
 People liked the work of Amitabh Bachchan in the film, and felt 'hatke'
 film kii editing kamaal kii lagi
 The lyrics and music of the film was very good
 film kaa kahani kehane kaa tarika, yani nerrative kamaal kaa he
 Nawaz's work was felt by the people as 'offending'
 tippaniyan i think these are all good qualities in the film, but i add something else
 
 
 mujhe film dhimi nahin lagi or saath hi main film kii kahani ke saath safar kar rahaa tha or jon vishwaas ke saath main bhi apradhi kii talash main tha
 
 
 The screenplay of the film is kaabil-e-praise and also the script
 
 
 film kii cinemotographi film ke mizaaj ko or umdaa karti he or saath hi becoground score film ke imoshan ko ujagar karata he
 
 
 And also the controlled direction of Ribhu
 
 
 to kul milakar ye sabhi kuubiyaan hai film main or yakeenan ek acchhee film he, to jaaie or film dekhie
 
 
 This film from my side 3
 5 star

 At the meeting of the IIT Council, the apex committee associated with the running of the Indian Institute of Technology, IIT, shouted slogans of 'bharat Mata Ki Jai'
 itihaas main aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua he
 Not only the council members raised slogans of 'bharat Mata Ki Jai', but also paid tributes to the meeting in memory of the martyrs under the 'jara Yaad Karo Kurbani' program

 The demand for change of leadership in the Congress-ruled states has been gaining momentum since the Congress lost the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke teen mukhyamantriyon- assam ke tarun gogoi, haryana ke bhupinder singh hooda or maharashtra ke prithviraj chavaan par talwaar latakati dikh rahi he
 Sources are quoting from the news that among the three Congress chief ministers who are hanging the sword, first of all, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi may be defeated
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke turant baad tarun gogoi ne apane istife kii peshkash kii thi, jise alaakaman ne thukraa diya tha
 But the high command may have to change its decision after a huge demand for change of leadership by the state Congress
 mana ja rahaa he ki rajya ke 78 main se 45 vidhayak netritv parivartan ke liye muhim chalaa rahe the or ye ashanka jataai ja rahi thi ki agar aisa nahin hota he, to party main baghawat bhi ho sakati he
 Significantly, assembly elections are due in Assam after two years
 idhar, congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke ghar ek baithak hui he, jisamen haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda bhi shaamil hue
 The demand for change of leadership in the state is rising after the Congress's poor performance in Haryana in the elections
 khaas baat yah he ki aaj hi sonia ek hafte ke liye videsh ja rahi hai
 On the other hand, there is strong opposition to the replacement of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra and this is the reason that the Chief Minister of the state Prithviraj Chavan reached Delhi late on Friday night and he first met Ahmed Patel
 mana ja rahaa he ki chavaan aaj bhi kai congressi netaaon se milenge
 Earlier speaking to the media, Chavan said that after the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, many chief ministers have told the party leadership that they want to work for the party and are ready to step down

 According to a written report given in Parliament, 86 soldiers have been killed in the terrorist attacks in Kashmir this year, compared to 74 during this period
 report main kaha gaya he ki suraksha balon ne is saal 2 disambar tak 238 aatankiyon ko maar giraaya he, jabaki is karwaai main ab tak 37 aam logon kii jaan gai
 As of October this year, terrorists have tried to infiltrate 284 times in which 128 times they were successful
 pichlesaal is avadhi main 113 baar aatanki desh kii seemaa main ghusane main kaamyaab hue the, jabaki ghuspaith kii 378 koshishen ho chuki thim
 The Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Hansraj Ahir, has said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha that the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been affected by cross-border sponsored and militant violence
 isi report par aadhaarit 'ajtak' ko sutron ne jaankaree di he ki pakistan kii khufia agency iesai paak adhikrut kashmir main aatanki camp chalaa kar aatankwaadiyon ko bharat ke khilaaf bhadakaane kii koshish main juta he
 Across the border, 13 new launching pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir are under the pretext of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of firing the Pakistan Army and ISI
 sutron ne 'ajtak' ko jaankaree di he ki is saal iesai ne aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane ke liye nae tareeke ke barfile registan main chalane vaale dress kharide hai
 It can be used to infiltrate Pakistani terrorists through closed routes during snowfall
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aaj sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv baan kii moon se mulaakaat kii or apane pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif kii ore se kal uthaae gaye kashmir mudde kaa hawala dete hue yah sanket die ki vaishvik sanstha is mudde par charchaa ke liye uchit manch nahin he
 During his meeting with Moon, Modi pointed to Sharif's statement on Kashmir because the Pakistani Prime Minister had raised the Kashmir issue in the United Nations General Assembly a day earlier
 aadhikarik sutron ne kaha ki modi ne mahasachiv moon se mulaakaat main sharif dwaara kashmir par die gaye bayaan kaa hawala dete hue sanket diya ki sanyukt raashtra is mudde ko uthaane kaa uchit manch nahin he kyonki yah ek dwipaksheeya maamla he
 In his address, Sharif had yesterday instigated India that six decades ago the United Nations had passed a resolution to hold a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir
 sharif ne kaha tha, 'jammu-kashmir ke log us vaade ke puraa hone kaa intjaar ab bhi kar rahe hai
 ' bhartiya nausena kii nai bharat main hi baniin pandubbiyaan, jinka ravivaar ko hi samudri pareekshan kiya gaya, darasal aisi banduukon jaisi haalat main hai, jinamein goliyaan nahin hon
 
 
 This is because the main weapon of the Scorpene class submarines - the Black Shark Torpedo - is also designed by the subsidiary company of Finmeccanica, and is manufactured by them, while blacklisted after bribing them to sell helicopters in India
 i went
 ek francisi company se teen arab dollar ke saude ke tahat mumbai main taiyaar kii gai chah deazal-electric pandubbiyon main se ek kalveri ko ravivaar ko majgaanv dock se pareekshan ke liye baahar samudr main nikaala gaya, taaki kuch hi maheene baad use sena main shaamil kiya ja sake
 But without its torpedoes, Kalveri would have no weapons to target enemy submarines
 hathiyaar ke naam par kalveri par sirf france main bani exoset misile hongi, jo dushman jahaajon ko nishaanaa bana sakati he, pandubbiyon ko nahin
 All six Scorpene class submarines are to be delivered to the Indian Navy before 2020, and are strongly in need of modernization, especially as China upgrades the navy
 philhal bharat ke paas kul 15 puraani pandubbiyaan hai, jo rus or germany kii bani hui hai
 The Rs 1,500-crore deal for 100 Black Shark Torpedoes was scheduled to be signed in 2013 with finmanica's subsidiary company Whitehead Sisteni Subaki (WASS)
 us vakt use nilambit kar diya gaya tha, or kuch hi maheene baad sarkaar ne finamaikanika kii ek or sabsidiari agastavestland ke saath helicopter sauda radd kar diya, or phir finamaikanika corporate family ko hi bharat sarkaar se kisi bhi tarah kaa sauda karne se pratibandhit kar diya gaya
 Senior sources in the Indian Navy told NDTV that it could take at least five years to identify, sort and then test the right torpedoes for the new contracts
 blike shark torpeado kaa chayan kai alag-alag tarah kii torpeado main se technical trial ke dauraan pradarshan, keemat or afasaron kii raay ke aadhaar par kiya gaya tha, jinhone kaha tha ki mumbai main taiyaar kii ja rahi pandubbiyon ke liye blike shark torpeado hi sarvshereshth rahegi
 The comments 50 note kii sheersh gati se chal sakane vaali blike shark torpeado ko dushman jahaajon or pandubbiyon ko rokane or nasht kar dene ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 Because of the state-of-the-art fiber-optic wiring - which maintains contact between the torpedo and the submarine after being fired - the Black Shark torpedo performs 200 percent better than the old-time torpedo
 haalanki ab kalveri pehali baar ghota lagaaegi, or apane sonar system ko adhiktam range tak test karegi, lekin us par tainaat kru ko maaloom ho, ki kahin agar sangharsh kii koi naubat ai, to ve sirf dushman pandubbi kii awaazen hi sun paaenge, kyonki unke paas hamalaa karne ke liye koi torpeado hogi hi nahin
 
 
 Kalveri, one of six diesel-electric submarines designed in Mumbai under a three billion dollar deal from a French company, was towed out of the Mazagaon dock on Sunday for testing, so that it was inducted a few months later
 Can go lekin apane torpeado ke bina kalveri par dushman pandubbiyon ko nishaanaa banane ke liye koi hathiyaar nahin honge
 In the name of the weapon, only French-made Exocet missiles will be on Kalveri, which can target enemy ships, not submarines
 sabhi chah scorpin class pandubbiyon ko 2020 se pehle bhartiya nausena ke hawaale kiya janaa he, or use aadhunikeekaran kii joardaar jarurat he, khaastaur se china dwaara nausena ko apgrade kiye jane kii vajah se

 The Black Shark Torpedo was selected during a technical trial out of several different types of torpedoes based on performance, price and opinion of the officers who said that the Black Shark Torpedo is the best for submarines being built in Mumbai
 Will remain tippaniyan a 50 shark top speed black shark torpedo is designed to intercept and destroy enemy ships and submarines

 His father and retired IPS officer Devi Singh Ashok were also close to BSP founders Kanshi Ram and Mayawati

 Apart from these few prominent police officers, more than 200 officers who have held good positions in Mayaraj have been selected and sent to insignificant posts

 It is in the application, that Sansonia and Rahul have said in their application that they had applied to the High Court to dismiss the summons issued from the lower court, but the High Court has also commented on the merit of the case in their decision
 iske alaava hai court ne arji dene waalon par bhi kai nakaaratmak tippaniyan kii hai

 But compared to single people in the country, the tendency of suicides among married people to give up on life remains more
 enciarabi (rashtriya aparaadh record beuro) kii haalia report ke mutabik varsh 2012 main aatmahatya ke sarkari aankadon par vaivaahik sthiti ke hisaab se najar daali jaye to pataa chalata he ki pichley saal apni jivan lila kaa khud ant karne waalon main 70
 3 percent were married, while 22
 6 pratishat shaadi ke bandhan main kabhi nahin bandhe the
 According to the NCRB report, in the year 2012, a total of 1,35,445 cases of suicide were reported in the country
 pichley saal 63,343 shaadishuda purushon ne jaan di, jabaki 31,921 vivaahitaaon ne aatmahatya kaa kadam uthaaya
 In the year 2012, the number of men who committed suicide was 19,727
 vahiin shaadi ke bandhan main nahin bandhane vaali 10,830 mahilaon ne maut ko gale lagaaya
 3 of those who committed suicide last year
 7 pratishat vidhur yaa vidhwaa ke darje vaale the
 3 among suicides
 5 pratishat log yaa to talakshuda the yaa kisi vajah se apane jeevanasathi se alag rah rahe the
 According to government figures, last year, the male-female ratio of suicide cases was 65:35, which means 65 males and 35 females per hundred people
 yah aankade ek or chintajanak pahalu kii ore dhyaan khinchate hue bataate hai ki varsh 2012 main aatmahatya karne vaale har chah logon main se ek gruhinee thi
 The NCRB report also throws light on the psychology of Indians who have committed suicide
 report bataati he, ‘yah dekha gaya ki pichley saal zyaadaatar purushon ne saamaajik or aarthik kaarnon se aatmahatya kii, jabaki adhiktar mahilaon ne bhaavnaatmak or nijee vajahon ke chalate khud apni jivan lila samaapt kar lee
 Renowned psychiatrist Deepak Mansharmani says that the prevalence of married life in the country is more than that of the unmarried ones, which makes it clear that the marital relationship is no longer the same emotional heat and that the 'bond of seven births' is stronger than any The practice of 'professional participation' has been going on
 manshaarmani ne kaha, ‘bhartiya samaaj ke taane-bane main bade badlaavon or parvarish kii galatiyon ke kaaran logon main vyaktigat sahansheeltaa lagaataar kam hoti ja rahi he
 This is also weakening the institution called Vivah
 ’ unhone kaha ki shaadiyaan tab hi lambe samay tak chal sakati hai, jab pati-patni ek-duusare kii kamiyon ko kabool karte hue aapas main poorak bane
 There may be an error in the analysis of data, if someone points out an improvement then we will definitely
 hamaara iraadaa kuch or nahin balki bas itnaa he ki rail yatriyon kii pareshaani kam ho or aankadon ko dekhnaa or samajhnaa hameen hi nahin aap bhi thik se sikh jaaen
