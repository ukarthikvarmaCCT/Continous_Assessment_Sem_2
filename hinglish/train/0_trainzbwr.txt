 bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyakke mudde par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or kendriya mantri nitin gadakari aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 Targeting Sonia Gandhi on Monday, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari accused him of misleading the country
 kendriya sadak evam parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne somvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se aagrah kiya ki ve bhoomi vidheyak par raajnneeti na karte hue rashtrahit main use paarit karaane main sarkaar kaa sahyog karen
 He has challenged Sonia Gandhi to open debate, so that the situation in front of the country becomes clear
 gadakari ko modi ne bhoomi vidheyak par vipakshi partiyon ko manaane kaa jimmaa saunpa he
 In this series, in a letter to Sonia Gandhi, she said, "I believe that such important issues should work keeping the national interest in mind and not on political grounds
" ' patr main unhone aarope lagaaya ki purv main congress ke netritv vaali UPA sarkaar ne aisa kanoon banaaya tha jisamen nijee kshetron ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke praavdhaan saral the kintu saarvajanik kshetron ke liye kathin
 Gadkari asked, "why is large-scale land acquisition excluded from the scope of social impact assessment under Article 105 of the UPA government's law
" ' unhone aarope lagaaya ki samprag sarkaar ne jaanboojhkar is tarah kii vyavastha kii thi
 He asked, 'did you do this to benefit private sector companies
 'unhone kaha, 'aapke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ke antargat hajaaron hectare bhoomi koyala block ke naam par adhigrahit kii ja sakati thi vah bhi bina kisi saamaajik akalan ke, lekin agar rajya sarkaar skool athwa sadak athwa sinchai pariyojna ke liye ek hectare bhi bhoomi chaahati he to unhen ek lambey or kathin prakriya se guzarana hota tha
 In fact, in a letter to Gadkari, Sonia had rejected Gadkari's offer to negotiate and said it was a joke and the BJP government unilaterally enforced the land ordinance
 vidheyak ko kisaan virdohi bataate hue sonia ne aarope lagaaya tha ki sarkaar udyogpatiyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye puri tarah samarpan kar rahi he
 Responding to this allegation, Gadkari said, "the previous government deliberately created a system in which large land acquisition projects were out of estimation while welfare projects run by the state government were stuck in it
 ' The institute, which runs a large series of madrasas in Uttar Pradesh, has now started a two-year 'anti-terrorism' course
 ye madrasa bareli aalaa hazrat kii dargah se sanchalit hote hai
 In this, students who teach Mufti will be taught how terrorists misinterpret the Quran and Hadith and use it for horror
 is course main aatankwaad kaa itihaas, bharat main aatankwaad or aatankwaad se islam kii hui badanaami jaise topic bhi shaamil hai
 This new course has been started in 48 madrasas of Ruhelkhand
 lekin ise dhire-dhire puure mulk main failaane kii yojana he
 In this way, now students of these madrasas will read about the training of Islam as well as the horror, because the terrorists are terrorizing in the name of Islam itself
 duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatankwaadi sanghathan iesas ke jhande par bhi 'allaah' or 'mohammad' hi likhaa he
 Therefore, those studying Mufti will be taught how terrorists are maligning Islam
 is course ko shuru karne vaale bareli ke mufti mohammad saleem nuri kehete hai - Salim Noori said, "terrorists use religion like opium
 aatanki training campon main kisi nae dehshatgard ke jehan main uthne vaale har sawaal kaa jawaab quran or haddees kii galat vyakhya kar diya jaataa he, taaki aatank failaate vakt use koi afsos na ho
 They are told that Kafirs have no right to be alive
 kafir ke jaan-maal donon par momin kaa akhriyaar he
 a suicide attack is justified in the way of Allah
 begunaahon kii maut par afsos kii jarurat nahin kyonki ve bhi tumhaare haathon marakar jananath jaaenge

 al-kafirun's verse number 109 of the Quran will be read, which says, "I do not worship what you do
" or tum uski ibaadat nahin karte, jisaki main karata hum
 
 
 Your religion is with you and my religion is with me
 " or quran kii sura al bakra kii aayat number-256 bhi padhai jaaegi jo kahati he, majahab ko lekar koi jor-jabardastee nahin he
 Allah is the One who hears and knows everything
 mufti saleem nuri kehete hai ki ham chaatro ko quran kii donon vyakhya padhaayenge
 One is the one who is right and the other is what the terrorist says
 phir ham chaatro ko yah bhi bataaenge ki iskaa reference context (sandarbh) kya he
 How a terrorist changes the meaning of an incomplete portion of a verse of the Quran by quoting it out of context (beyond context)
 
 
 yah logon kii ankhen kholane vaala hoga
 The brain wash that is done in the name of religion, states that the real life will be achieved after death, when after death there will be hunches in Jannat, who will always be young

 When he regained consciousness in the ICU of the hospital, he asked the nurse standing close to him, where are the other hurries? If the training of this new course is spread, then people will surely understand that it is not Islam, only horror
 ye nayaa course ruhelkhand ke 48 madrason main shuru kiya gaya he
 But there are plans to gradually spread it across the country
 is tarah ab in madrason ke chaatr islam kii talim ke saath-saath dehshatgardi ke bare main bhi padhenge, kyonki dehshatgard islam ke naam par hi dehshatgardi kar rahe hai
 The flag of ISIS, the world's most dreaded terrorist organization, has also written 'allah' and 'mohammed'
 lihaaja mufti kii padhai karne waalon ko padhaayaa jayega ki kis tarah aatankwaadi islam ko badnaam kar rahe hai
 Mufti Mohammad Salim Noori of Bareilly, who started this course, says - saleem nuri ne kaha, "aatankwaadi dharm ko opium kii tarah istemaal karte hai
 Every question that arises in the mind of a new terrorist in terrorist training camps is answered by misinterpretation of the Quran and Hadith, so that there is no regret in spreading terror
 unhen bataaya jaataa he ki kafir ko jinda rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 Momin has a stake in both Kafir's life and property
 allaah kii raah main aatmghaatee hamalaa jaij he
 There is no need to regret the death of innocents because they too will die at your hands
 kafiron kaa katl hi jihad he
 If we are martyred after fighting the Kafirs, then there will be sacrifices in heaven
 " tippaniyan But in this anti-terrorism course, the correct explanation of all these issues will be taught, so that students who become muftis can understand the lies of terrorists
 quran kii sura al kafirun kii aayat number-109 padhai jaaegi jo kahati he, "main uski ibaadat nahin karata, jisaki tum karte ho
 And you do not worship what i do
 
 
 tumhaara dharm tumhaare saath or meraa dharm mere saath he
 "and Surah al-bakra's verse number-256 of the Quran will also be read which says, there is no coercion about religion
 allaah sab kuch sunne or jaanane vaala he
 Mufti Salim Noori says that we will teach students both interpretations of the Quran

 On Doctor's Day, talk about relatives who are not less than doctors in any sense
 har rishtedaar potential doctor hota he, jo aapke biimaar padate hi asli rup main aa jaataa he
 If doctors are another form of God, then relatives will also have some elusive form of them
 doctors de par ek-ek badhai sandesh un tamaam rishtedaaron ko bheja janaa chahie, jo ibola se lekar haade ke bukhaar tak kaa ilaaj karnaa jaanate hai
 Relatives have a habit, they are always concerned about your health, see you even after two hours, then you can see the decline in health
 har rishtedaar khud main pathalogy hota he, jo bina ek boond khun nikaale saare rog bataa saktaa he, ankhon se body moss index nikaal saktaa he or maathaa chhukar taapmaana jaan saktaa he
 Relatives are dangerous, they become more dangerous in case of illness
 bhagwaan na kare, vahi beemaari agar unhone khud jheli ho tab aapako khud bhagwaan bhi nahin bachaa sakate
 Relatives are ambiguous, their eyes are microscopic
 agar unke taaoo ke saale kii chachee ko bhi pantis saal pehle ardh kapaari hua ho, to unhen sari duniya sir pakade najar aane lagati he
 Your eyes are heavy, the head is aching, there is a slight spasm in the throat, they will also call it a half cup
 bhale aap memia paden, aapako pataa ho ki dard sirf computer ke saamne der tak bina aaraam kiye kaam karne se hua he, wo nahin maanenge ye ardh kapaari hi he, kyonki unke taaoo ke saale kii chachee ko bhi pantis saal pehle hua tha
 The favorite disease of relatives is Vata, by turning the head and ask, you will get a specialist of every other relative Vata disease
 wo aapako cese history bataa sakate hai, dasiyon anubhav gina sakate hai, marij ke naam se lekar ilaaj main lage din or kul kharch bataa sakate hai
 The treatment of this disease is also very fun, someone will recommend applying fish oil, then someone will heat papaya leaves in mustard oil
 ek rishtedaar aise hi maukey par meri daadi ko wo tel de gaye, jo raat ko lagane par radium sa chamakta tha, ilaaj kya khaak hona tha hamane use har raat laga-laga matrix-matrix khel daalaa
 The one who kills the most is the Confidence of relatives, every one comes with such confidence that the disease itself will tremble
 ilaaj bataane vaala khud itani taiyaari se aayaa lagata he ki beemaari ko homework main kami si lagati he
 Diseases should be humanized, they should also get word, they will tell that many symptoms were not found in them at first, relatives heard and developed later
 aise rishtedaaron ke saamne kabhi dhang ke doctor kaa naam nahin lenaa chahie
 He will prove him ineffective from his experiences, he should continue to treat cancer according to the relatives in the eyes, even if you have been cured by puncturing three needles a week
 rishtedaar jab puuchhen to tulsi ke pattey main ghi-kattha khaakar hi thik hua hoon bataaie
 You can avoid illness, avoid a doctor, avoid relatives

 One such friend told us one day that the time gap is an occasion for annual celebrations, and most of the big names will be seen in it
 maine bhi vahaan jane ke liye kaha to unhone turant haa kar di
 On the evening of 9 December i reached there with all my friends who were associated with Pankaj Bisht's magazine

 unhen dekhakar acha laga, phir asagar vajahat, maitreyi puspa or pankaj bisht sabase mila
 Everyone was fun to speak
 sab ko pard rakhaa tha, jisase milane kaa majaa doguna tha
 The author who attracted the most attention was Pankaj Singh
 us samay tak maine unki ek kavita tak nahin padhi thi
 His name was occasionally heard from friends
 lekin padhaa kuch nahin tha
 i was taking the most signature on this issue of time interval so that this evening would be memorable
 to jab main pankaj singh ke paas gaya to unhone apane chir-parichit andaaj main, hansate hue or buland aawaaj main meraa naam poocha, or kitaab par apane sin karke, mere peeth par pyaar se thapki di or meraa hausala badhaate hue kaha ki kabhi fursat ho to milanaa

 maine unhen phone kiya or naam bataaya to unhone turant mujhe pahchaan liya
 i asked to meet, so he said that come back anytime before
 kuch din baad unase time lekar main pahunchaa
 As soon as i reached his house in East Stand of Mayur Vihar, he greeted me with great warmth
 baahar halki barish ho rahi thi
 When i sat there, it started raining and loud
 ve kavita or marxvad ko lekar baaten karne lage
 When they asked me for tea, i said yes
 chaay ai to mere paseene chhot gaye
 There was black tea, which i did not like at all, then Pankaj Singh said that add lemon to it, the fun will be doubled
 maine daal liya to jabardast cultural shock laga
 i could not understand that tea-drinking person
 jaise-taise vah gilaas gatak gaya
 Perhaps if they understood this, they said that if they do not look good, let it be
 maine kuch nahin bolaa or chaay khatm kar di
 He had a smile on his face, and yes he did not drink tea because there was blood coming out of his teeth
 uske baad mere kariyar se lekar unke safar ke bare main dheron baaten huin
 Seeing me a little disturbed, he said many encouraging things, and also recited three to four poems
 lekin bhavishya se jude kai sanshayon ke saath main vahaan baitha tha, or shaayad isi vajah se unki kavita “bhavishyafal” kaa sheershak mere jehan main jinda rah gaya

 jabaki uttar gujarat main gandhinagar, banaaskantha, sabarkantha, aravali, mehsana, chota udaipur alvalli or patan jile aate hai
 In the second round of Gujarat assembly elections, Central gujarat-north Gujarat is considered very important for both BJP and Congress

 The BJP is on fire in urban areas including Ahmedabad and Vadodara

 congress kaa daaman thaamne vaale obisi netaa alpesh thakor or unke 7 samarthakon ko party ne maidan main utaara he
 Alpesh faces a big challenge to win the elections to himself and his supporters, as well as the OBC vote in the Congress side
 bijepi ne bhi obisi votbank ko apane paksh main karne ke liye khaas ranneeti banaai he
 Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani is contesting as an Independent from Vadgam seat
 congress kaa unhen samarthan hasil he
 But Jignesh himself is in the fray, BJP has a strong siege against him
 jignesh apni seat tak hi simit hai or rajya kii baaki siton par wo prachaar main nahin ja paa rahe hai
 In such a situation, the game of taking advantage of the Congress through the Jignesh card seems to be a mess
 hardik ke saamne chunautipatidaar netaa hardik patel bijepi ke khilaaf jhanda buland kiye hue hai

 bjp's strongman and deputy CM is a candidate from Mehsana
 aise main hardik ke saamne bijepi ke khilaaf patidaaron ke vot dalane kii chunauti hai, to vahiin nitin patel ke saamne apni seat bachaane ke saath-saath apane samaaj ko bijepi ke saath jode rakhana hoga
 Due to Patel's displeasure, BJP has faced a major challenge, including Nicole and Bapunagar, the urban seat of Ahmedabad

 3
 During an posting in Delhi, Natwar's eyes were fixed on Hem, the beautiful daughter of Maharaj Yadavindra Singh of Patiala, at an official function
 ye pehali najar ke pyaar jaisaa kuch tha
 At the end of the first meeting, Natwar asked Hem
 kya main aapako phone kar saktaa hu
 The meeting lasted one and a half years
 phir kanat place ke gelord restaraan main hem ke janmdin par natwar ne prapoj kar diya
 Three weeks later, the answer was received
 patiala ke rajpariwaar ne shuruaati virodh kiya
 Then everything was accepted
 shaadi main ek gavaah ke bataur dastakhat kiye indira gandhi ne
 4
 videsh seva se natwar ko dilli bula liya gaya
 To work in Nehru's Prime Minister's Office
 yaheen unhone is desh ke pehle taqatvar naukarshah pien haksar ke saath kaam kiya
 One day Nehru wrote a letter to the Head of State and gave it to the PMO with the file
 file pahunchi natwar ke paas jo khat padhakar magan to ho gaye, magar jise dena tha, use dene ke bajaay or kaam main vyast ho gaye

 indira ne hami bhar di
 It was decided that he would resign from the IFS and enter Parliament through the Rajya Sabha
 magar congress mahasachiv rajeev gandhi kii kareebi kotary ko natwar kaa ye dakhal raas nahin aayaa
 Why the Rajya Sabha was stirred up

 Natwar won the Lok Sabha elections from Bharatpur
 7
 Natwar joined Rajiv Gandhi's Council of Ministers as a Minister of State
 magar unhen shuruaati saalon main videsh mantralay nahin mila
 However, Rajiv kept taking his opinion on all important issues
 natwar kaa kahana he ki rajeev ne srilanka ke mudde par unhen kinare rakhaa
 He has claimed that Rajiv Gandhi also met LTTE Chief Prabhakaran himself and asked his ministers to meet many times
 ek baar to alam ye ho gaya ki bengalooru main gut nirpeksh deshon ke pramukhon kii baithak chal rahi thi
 8
 rajeev kii hatya ke baad tamaam videshi pramukh or netaa sonia gandhi se milane pahunche
 During this, Natwar Singh was constantly with Sonia
 pakistan kii netaa benazir bhutto ne sonia gandhi ko salaah di ki unhen apane bacchon kii khatir siyasat se dur hi rahanaa chahie
 Natwar reacted to this and said, why did you not follow the advice you are giving
 gauratlab he ki benazir ke pita julfikar ali bhutto pakistan ke pradhanmantri the or faujee takhtapalat ke baad unhen faansee de di gai thi
 Benazir later took over the father's legacy

 He suggested the first name of the then Vice President Shankar Dayal Sharma
 sharma ne apane kharaab swasth kaa hawala de inkaar kar diya
 Then came the turn of PV Narasimha Rao
 magar piem banane ke baad narsimha raav or sonia gandhi ke bich sambandh lagaataar kharaab hote chale gaye

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke ran main chauthe charan kii 71 sansadeey siton par 29 april yani somvaar ko vot daale jaaenge
 In this phase, the challenge before the BJP is to save its fort while to do something in front of the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi puri tarah se chunavi sangram main pasinaa bahaane main jute hai
 At the same time, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is working day and night to get his lost political land
 loksabhaa chunaav ke chauthe charan main 9 rajyon kii 71 loksabhaa siton par voting hogi
 These include five seats in Bihar, one in Jammu and Kashmir, three in Jharkhand, six in Madhya Pradesh, 17 in Maharashtra, six in Odisha, 13 in Rajasthan, 13 in Uttar Pradesh and eight in West Bengal
 chauthe charan kii jin 71 siton par voting honi he, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon ke lihaaj se ise dekhen to bijepi ne vipaksh kaa puri tarah se safaya kar diya tha
 Out of 71, BJP alone managed to win 45 seats
 jabaki bijepi apane sahyogi dalon ke saath yani endie 56 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Apart from BJP, Shiv Sena got 9 seats and LJP 2 seats
 vahiin, congress ko mahaj 2 siten mili thim, jinamein madhya pradesh kii chhindwara or pashchim bengal kii beharampur seat thi
 Kamal Nath from Chhindwara and Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary from Behrampur had managed to win
 congress ke alaava naveen patnayak kii party bijedy 6 siten jiti thi
 TMC 6 and SP 1 seats were won
 bijepi ke saamne 45 siten bachaane kii chunautiaise main chauthaa charan bijepi ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 The challenge before the BJP is to save its 45 seats
 jabaki rahul gandhi ke saamne congress ko do siton se aage badhaane kaa chalange he
 The Congress could not win any of the 13 seats in Rajasthan where elections are held
 ye sabhi bijepi ko mili thim
 In the 6 seats in Madhya Pradesh where elections were held, Congress could win only one seat and the remaining five seats were won by BJP
 aise main congress kii najar rajasthan or madhya pradesh ke saath maharashtra par he
 The changed power in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh has given the Congress hope of victory
 maharashtra kii 17 loksabhaa siton par voting honi he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena and BJP had managed to win all these 17 seats
 shivasena ko 9 or bijepi ko 8 siten mili thim
 Congress and NCP did not get a single seat
 is baar badale hue sameekaran main congress-ensipi gathbandhan ne shivasena-bijepi ke durg bhedane kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi he
 At the same time, elections are to be held in three seats of Jharkhand, all of which are with the BJP
 is baar congress mahagathbandhan ke jariye jeet kii aas lagaae hue he
 13 seats of Uttar Pradesh are to be voted under the fourth phase
 2014 main bijepi ko inamen se 12 or sapa ko ek seat mili thi
 This time the BJP is facing a tough challenge from the SP-BSP alliance
 jabaki congress bhi kai siton par jeet kii aas lagaae hue he
 However, bjp's special focus is on Bengal and Odisha
 bengal kii jin 8 siton par chunaav hai inamen se ek seat bijepi or ek seat congress ko mili thi
 The remaining 6 seats went to tmc's account
 is baar bijepi apni siton ko badhaane main juty he
 While the 6 seats in Odisha where elections are being held, all these seats are with BJD
 bijepi odisha main apni jagah banane kii kavayad main juty he
 In this way, where the BJP has a challenge to retain a large number of 45 seats in the fourth phase of polling, the Congress will try to win as many seats as possible while rectifying its worst performance of 2014

 The International Court of Justice in The Hague has ordered the execution of Jadhav to be stayed until the final verdict is pronounced

 Can he hang Jadhav? According to experts, now Pakistan will refrain from doing so after the order of the International Court
 chunki pakistan yuan kaa sadsy or international court of justise kaa sadsy desh he, isliye vah kanoonee taur par ab karegaa, isaki gunjaaish kam he

 par sajaa se pehle hi april 2013 main kuch kaidiyon ne sarbajit par hamalaa kar diya tha or 5 din baad aspataal main unhone dam tod diya
 Why is there a threat to Jadhav, but the final verdict of the International Court has not yet come

 In such a situation, anything can happen in a long time of three months

 Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was arrested earlier in Pakistan under suspicion about Kulbhushan, has been sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan, but Pakistan has always been hiding the facts about it
 usne kaaphi samay tak bharat ko ye nahin bataaya ki kulbhushan jivit he yaa nahin or kis jail main rakhaa gaya he
 -pak has framed Jadhav in this way, know what happened in this case? -pakistan has lost the case to India in ICJ even 18 years ago -pakistan's bundle of lies and the reality of the allegations against Jadhav - ICJ works like this a team of 15 judges will decide in Jadhav case - will justice be done in Jadhav case? Nikam said - India firmly put its side - Jadhav's lawyer has a house of 100 crores, Bell was given to Salman in 3 hours

 During the Lok Sabha elections, there was an interesting contest between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the Varanasi seat
 is mukaable main jite to modi par chunaav prachaar ke dauraan unhone kejariwal par chuppi banaae rakhi
 At that time everyone had the same question in their mind that why is Modi doing this? Now the Prime Minister himself has revealed the reason for this
 bhale hi dilli vidhansabha chunaav main kejariwal ne bijepi ko badi patkhni di ho, lekin kai maheene pehle tak pradhanmantri unhen ek chote shahar kaa netaa maanate the, jis ke bare bayaanbaji karnaa vakt barbaad karne ke samaan hota
 Modi said this to former BBC journalist Lance Price in July last year
 price ne is baat kaa zikr apni pustak 'da modi effect: insaide narendra modij compain tu transform india' main kiya he
 The book also mentions a fight between AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal and Modi in Varanasi
 kejariwal par chunaav prachaar ke dauraan chuppi ke bare main puche jane modi ne price se kaha, 'meri khamoshi meri takat he
 You should know that in a larger perspective, Kejriwal is nothing but a small leader of a city
 vipaksh ke anya netaaon ke mukaable unhen jarurat se zyada surkhiya mil rahi hai
 In such a situation, why waste time ignoring anyone? Therefore, it is not even worth that i waste my time in ignoring Kejriwal
 'modi ne kaha, 'kejariwal ko narendra modi ko nishaanaa banane or congress ko bachaane ke liye media ke ek chuninda samooh ne congress ke ishaare par uchhaala
 Keep in mind that he is not even a Member of Parliament, as Chief Minister he was able to stay for only 49 days and could not get even one percent of the national vote
 'matganana ke vakt tivi nahin dekh rahe the modi16 may 2014 kii taarikh ko hi narendra modi ke haathon main desh kii kaman aa gai wo bhi prachand bahumat ke saath
 But what Narendra Modi himself was doing on the day of election results
 kahaan the wo
 What was going on at the time in Modi's heartbreak? in sawaalon ke jawaab bhi narendra modi ne die hai
 He said, 'I was completely alone at the time when the counting of votes was going on in the morning
 mere paas koi tivi set bhi nahin tha
 i was meditating
 us din meri pehali baatcheet rajnath singh se hui
 i received his first call later that afternoon
 rajnath singh kii raay thi ki aisa to hona hi tha
 We knew in advance that we were getting a large majority
 'aise tamaam dilachasp raaj is kitaab main saamne aayaa he
 Modi also told how he had already realized that he could be the candidate for the post of PM during the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki, unhen itani jaldi ummidavaari mil jaaegi, isaki ummid nahin thi
 The book also has a long discussion on Modi's propaganda policy
 kaise modi ne media se duuri banaakar apane liye dilchaspee jagaai, iskaa zikr bhi modi ne kiya he

" ” ab jab bhartiya arthvyavastha naukariyon ke ghor sankat kii ore bad rahi he, aise main jaruri he ki iske nirdosh shikaar—jinaki sankhya kaaphi hogi—jindagi ko dhyaan main rakhen or kaamyaab naakaamiyon ke liye taiyaar hon
 Ten things to keep in mind for those who are looking for a job or who feel that they may soon be able to do the same: 1 No job is better than having someone
 chunaav ke pehle nai bhartiyon main teji nahin aane vaali
 Employed people should wear helmets and hide under desks
 naukari kii talash kar rahe logon ko apni apekshaayen kam kar leni chahie; yah chhaantane-chhodie vaala samay nahin he
 2 Do something new
 nae vichaaron ke liye yah badhibia samay he
 Prepare yourself for additional responsibilities, handling the work of colleagues who have left work
 apni marketing main sankoch na karen
 Invest in learning
 mandi apane andar chhipe hunar ko taraashne kaa sunaharaa mauka detii he
 The pace of change is accelerating and the world of skilled or unskilled, rural or urban, construction or services work is changing with technology
 yah computing, communication or vyapaar ke saath aane kaa samay he
 3 keep in touch
 zyaadaatar naukariyaan un logon ke madhyam se nahin milteen, jinhen aap bahut acchhee tarah jaanate hai (majboot sambandh), balki un logon ke madhyam se milti hai jo aapke network ke daayre main hote hai (halke-phulke sambandh)
 Maintain light-hearted contact with your classmates, former colleagues, parents of children's classmates and everyone else
 4 zyada bachat karen
 The best preparation for a difficult time is to spread the foot inside the sheet, keep credit card expenses and other debts to a minimum and avoid those expenses
 behatar vikalpon kaa intjaar karne ke liye yah lacheelaapan behad jaruri he
 Leave the quarrel of age 5
 kuch naukariyaan aisi hoti hai jo urja, utsaah or kam tankhwaah vaale yuvaaon ke paksh main baithti hai
 Ignore them
 mushkil daur main tajurba bahut myne rakhata he
 Remind the employees that you are aged, intelligent and therefore more effective
 6 parivaar or doston ko kareeb rakhen
 Remind yourself that we live not in an economy but in a society
 jindagi kii sabase acchhee chijen bhautik chijen nahin hai or sankat ke badal bhi chant jaaenge
 Spending time with family and friends will be the foundation stone for your health
 7 baatcheet jari rakhen or koshish badhayen
 In difficult times, the ratio of interview calls also decreases
 aise main apni taraf se koshishen badhayen
 As such opportunities are rarely available, so the art of negotiation or bargaining is very important
 padnaam, seekhney ke maukey, bhoomika, shahar or un sabhi chizon par saaf-saaf baat karne ke liye taiyaar rahen jin par aap tankhwaah ke liye samjhauta karne ko taiyaar hai
 8 Think about your business
 main kabhi kisi naakhush kaamyaab udhyami se nahin mila magar kai naakhush kaamyaab karmchaariyon ko jaanata hum
 The difficult phase is not only the door to becoming your own boss, but due to the competition, it also provides many unique opportunities

 haalanki yah us samay kii baat he jab na to haryana kaa astitv tha or na hi punjab kaa
 According to Urdu Press, Gurugram has more than six lakh Muslims and most of them are migrant laborers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh

 Part of a larger conspiracy that began four years ago
 mujhe pataa he ki pehle kii sarkaron main or desh ke baaki hisson main bhi aisi ghatnaayen hui hai
 But the difference is that now they are happening very easily and more accurately under the nose of the government
 hakeekat yah he ki ab na to koi sunwaayee kii jagah he or na hi kanoonee vyavastha jiske chalate zyaadaatar musalamaanon ke saamne aage kaa rasta band he
 Throughout my life, i have taken equal pride in both my nationality and my religion
 mere dimag main uljhan nahin thi
 For me, being Muslim was as important as being Indian
 pehali chot lagi babari masjid dhahaae jane se, duusari gujarat main 2002 main hue narsanhaar se
 Earlier, even in the darkest times, a light of hope was seen, but this time the incidents are very high, frequent and blistering that there is no hope left
 jin logon ne musalamaanon se nafrat ko hi apana dharm bana rakhaa he, unke liye mere paas kuch nahin he sivaay mere afsos ke ki un logon ne apane hi khubasurat majahab ko khokhla kar diya he
 For Muslims, i have an idea of human friendship or humanism

 2018 main congress party ke adhyaksh kii jimmedaari milane ke baad rahul gandhi ne 2019 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle apni choti bahan priyanka ko party main mahasachiv banane kaa nirnay liya he
 While this decision of the Congress party has been linked with familyism, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the Congress workers
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle priyanka kii entry ko masterstroke ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 This is also because she plays the role of a skilled manager, a strong campaigner and an excellent architect
 kushal manager47 saal kii priyanka gandhi wadra abhi tak khud ko congress kii gatividhiyon se alag rakhte hue apane parivaar ke liye kaam karti rahi hai
 Especially in the parliamentary constituencies of mother Sonia Gandhi and brother Rahul Gandhi, their role and activism are considered very important
 1998 main maa sonia gandhi ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad priyanka gandhi pramukhataa se saamne ain
 In the 1999 general election, Sonia Gandhi contested the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi in UP and Bellary in Karnataka
 sonia ke do siton se chunavi maidan main hone ke chalate priyanka ne amethi ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhali
 At the time of this election, Priyanka was 28 years old and campaigned fiercely for her mother
 isi dauraan amethi se lagi hui raibareli seat se congress ummidavaar ke taur par captain satish sharma chunaav lard rahe the
 Arun Nehru of BJP was in the fray against him, in whose favor there was a strong atmosphere
 priyanka ne chunaav prachaar ke aakhri din captain satish sharma ke paksh main prachaar karke arun nehru ko jeet se maharoom kar diya
 He had said only one thing during the campaign that you people will win the election to this traitor who betrayed the Gandhi family
 haalanki, isse pehle vah apane pita rajeev gandhi ke saath bhi amethi aati rahi hai
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Amethi seat was left for Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi went to contest from Rae Bareli, the seat of her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi
 is chunaav main priyanka ne amethi or raibareli donon kshetron main prachaar kiya
 Priyanka Gandhi's activism about Rae Bareli and Amethi can also be gauged from the fact that every week people from Rae Bareli area still come to Delhi and Priyanka Gandhi visits them
 vah aksar raibareli kaa daura karti rahati hai
 While camping there during the election
 raibareli or amethi ke liye congress party ek alag ranneeti ke tahat vidhansabha or block str par sanghathan ke kaam kaa bantwaaraa karti he or priyanka gandhi swayan is sab par najar rakhti hai
 Apart from this, in both the parliamentary seats, from the panchayat elections to the assembly elections, she decides the ticket
