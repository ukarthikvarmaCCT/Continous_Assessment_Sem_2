 paksh or vipaksh kii udaseenta ke bich berojgaaron ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki ve apane muddon kaa kya karen
 j Mazumdar's news appeared in the Indian Express of 20 March
 is khabar ke anusaar work force yani kaam karne waalon kii taadaad main tezi se giravat ai he
 Fewer people are currently engaged at work than they were five years ago
 1993-94 ke baad pehali baar ai kaary bal main giravat ai he
 NSSO conducted the Periodic Labor Force Survey for 2017-18, the report has not been made public
 iske anusaar 2012-13 main purushon kaa work force yani kaary bal 30
 4 crores which decreased to 28 in 2017-18
 6 karod ho gaya
 Such a decline in the work force of men has been seen for the first time since 1993-94
 gaanvon main purushon ke kaary bal main 6
 There is a 4 percent drop
 yah kaaphi he
 4 in cities

 You will remember that when the government was not releasing this report, then in December last year, the acting Chairman of the National Statistical Commission, PC Mohan and other member JV Meenakshi resigned
 is data ke anusaar 4 karod se adhik rojgaar khatm hua he
 Between 2011–12 to 2017–18
 berojgaare kitni bhayaavah ho gai hogi aap samaj sakate hai
 Shouldn't unemployment be debated at this time
 sirf congress bijepi karne ke liye nahin, balki hamane kya aisa kiya jisase berojgaare itani bhayaavah ho gai or kya aisa karne vaale hai, kya hamaare raajnneetik dalon ke paas vaaki koi aisa idia he jisase lage ki berojgaare ko lekar koi samaadhaan nikal saktaa he
 If this question is not taken lightly, then for the next five years, the unemployed will do injustice to themselves
 berojgaaron or naujavaanon ko sabhi netaaon ko majaboor karnaa hoga ki ve berojgaare ke sawaal par aaen
 State your blueprint

 There were only 17 lakh candidates who had only 10th qualification
 railway ne daawa kiya tha ki 2 karod aavedan aae the
 This is the condition
 padhe likhe logon ke liye rojgaar nahin he
 Everyday messages from the unemployed come
 kaayade se is mudde par gambhir bahes honi chahie thi
 Issues in this election do not seem to have any relation with unemployment, but how long will this situation be avoided

 They say that media coverage is not happening, but they should be asked the question, what do these people see when they watch news channels? Do they read such news seriously and firstly? There are two types of fighting at the time of elections

 The Shiv Sena has said that Narendra Modi's statement of 'toilets first, then temples' shows that the BJP is not in touch with the idea of its prime ministerial candidate
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘vastav main modi vahi kah rahe hai, jo jairam ramesh isse pehle kehete rahe hai
 The Congress should appoint Modi as the brand ambassador for the toilet project
 
 
 ’sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘modi ko shauchalay vaali tippanee ke liye aalochana jhelni padi
 He called 'jai Jayaram' instead of 'jai Shriram', after which efforts started in the party to avoid questions about it
 ’isamen kaha gaya he, ‘tasviir yah he ki modi netritv kar rahe hai or bijepi anusaran kar rahi he
 What can we say Everyone should be involved in toilet construction
 jahaan tak mandir nirmaan kaa sawaal he, to ham use baad main dekhenge
 "the editorial says," Modi has put forward a bold idea from the commentary 'first toilet, then Devalaya'
 yah hairaan karne vaala he ki congress ne iske liye un par hamalaa bolaa
 'the editorial says,' When Ramesh first put forth his views, he was criticized by BJP, VHP and Sangh Parivar
 ab bijepi netaa modi kaa bachaav kar rahe hai
 'the editorial further states that if Modi and Ramesh announce the construction of schools and public facilities at the places where illegal mosques and madrasas stand, it would indeed be the mantra of secularism
 kya kaha tha narendra modi ne
 
 
 In an event organized for youth on 2 October, Narendra Modi said, 'build the toilet first, the temple later
 ’ modi ne kaha tha ki unki chhavi ek hindutvvaadi netaa kii he, iske baavjood ve yah kehane kaa saahas rakhte hai
 Uddhav has endorsed Modi Uddhav Thackeray had recently welcomed Modi to be bjp's prime ministerial candidate and said that Amrit has come out after the 'samundra Manthan'
 uddhav ne kaha, ‘vartmaan paristhitiyon main yadi kanges parajeet hoti he or hindutv protsaahit hota he tathaa desh kii bagdor modi ke haathon main jaati he, to shivasena uskaa khule dil se swaagat karegi
 ' pulavama hamale kaa badla lete hue bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main ghuskar air strike ko anjaam diya he
 The Mirage aircraft of the Air Force has targeted the hideouts of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed and 200-300 terrorists are expected to be killed in the operation
 bharat kii ore se pakistan ke khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa, balakot, mujaffarabad or chakoti sthit launch pad ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 Reacting to the Air Force's Air Strike, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah first tweeted the Air Force's action by tweeting, but his position changed within minutes after the situation was cleared and he called the operation a surgical strike
 Is also called a major action
 We’ve entered a whole new paradigm with the Balakote air strike
 The post Uri strike was to avenge our losses, Balakote was a "preemptive strike to prevent an imminent jem attack"
 Totally new ballgame
 - Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah) February 26, 2019 Omar wrote in a tweet that for the first time since 1971, an air strike has been carried out against Pakistan in a peace period, for the first time, the military has been known to be effective
 saath hi unhone kaha ki balakot air strike se hamane ek nai misaal pesh kii he, uri ke baad sargical stril hamaara badla thi, lekin balakot strike ne jaish ke mansoobon par pani pher diya
 Earlier in his tweet, Omar had said that if this operation took place in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, then there is a really strong air strike
 lekin agar yah poonch sector ke balakot main hua he to sirf sankethik karrwai he
 Because at this time the forward launch pads of the terrorists remain empty and are not working
 If this is Balakote in KPK it’s a major incursion & a significant strike by IAF planes
 However if it's Balakote in the Poonch sector, along the loc it's a largely symbolic strike because at this time of the year forward launch pads & militant camps are empty & non-functional
 — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)february 26, 2019is pehle air strike kii shuruaati jaankaree milte hi abdulla ne twit kar kaha ki agar yah sahi he to koi choti strike nahin he, lekin pehle hamen aadhikarik pushti kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 He wrote in another tweet that now Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan will have a problem of fulfilling promises

 Fans of 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah' are eagerly waiting for their favorite character

 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma (taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah)' se jude sutron ke mutabik, sho ke nirmaataaon ko dayaban ko sho main laane kii koi jaldbaaji nahin he
 Whatever actress will be selected for Dayaben's character will be done very thoughtfully

 Dayaben is the wife of Jethalal in 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', and till now Disha Wakani played the character
 lekin disha vakaani ne bitiyaa ke janm ke baad kuch samay kaa brake liya tha
 But media reports have said that the terms of direction of returning to the show are something that the producers do not agree with
 isliye nai dayaban kii talash jor-shor se chal rahi he

 Is there any restlessness in your mind while making a physical connection that no one is listening to your voices with an ear? Due to this restlessness, you are neither satisfied with yourself, nor are you able to please your partner
 aisa aksar hota he, kabhi ghar main bahut se logon ke hone ke chalate yaa bedroom kaa ghar ke kisi duusare sadsy ke bedroom se sate hone ke chalate
 Is it because of these troubles that you keep on sighing only to get sighs that increase the flavor
 agar aisa he, to yahaan aapke liye kuch kargar suzav hai
 Look completely sealed in the market
 aap ko aapaki pareshaani ke ek nahin, anek hal mil jaaenge
 If the sound goes out through the doors, then instead of being silent yourself, close the mouth of your doors, that is, seal them
 daravaaje ke thik neeche se lekar upar tak har us jagah jahaan se aawaaj baahar jane kii ashanka ho, sil laga den
 Keep in mind one thing, after sealing, extinguish the lights of the room and see if the light outside is coming in from the doors
 agar kisi jagah se roshni bheetar aa sakati ho, to aawaaj ke liye bhi vah rasta saaf he
 Close that too
 len dhime sangeet kaa saharabrukas acosti korporation ke adhyaksh benet brookes kaa kahana he ki sambadhon ke dauraan kai anchaahi awaajen aati hai, jaise palang kaa siraahaana diwaar se takaraane par yaa spring vaale gadde se uthne vaali awaajen
 You cannot stop these voices even by wishing
 in se bachane liye kamare main halkaa sangeet bhi baja sakate hai
 This will free one from the worry of going outside the voices and the other will increase the flavor of the relationship
 bachaav ke saadhan or bhi hai
 
 
 Buy a thick stuffed mat from the market and place it right behind the door
 iske awala takiya yaa kambal bhi ek acha vikalp he
 If you have young children in your house and you are afraid that they will not listen to you in the night time, then open your shower
 shower kii aawaaj bacchon kaa dhyaan aapaki ore nahin aane degi
 Just what are you afraid of now? hindustan ke raashtra dhvaj tirange ko fahraane kaa har naagarik kaa moulik adhikaar he, lekin sabhi naagarik apane vaahan par is tirange ko nahin laga sakate hai
 According to the Indian Flag Code 2002, only a select few sitting in constitutional positions are allowed to hoist the tricolor in their vehicle
 saal 2004 se pehle tak sirf sarkari vibhaagon, karyaalayon or shaikshanik sansthaanon main hi tirangaa fahraane kii ijaajat thi, lekin saal 2004 main bharat sarkaar banaam naveen jindal maamle main supreme court ne kaha ki har hindustani ko tirangaa fahraane kaa moulik adhikaar he
 This right is given to all citizens under Article 19 of the Constitution
 iske baad se sabhi nagarikon ko tirangaa fahraane kaa adhikaar mil gaya
 However, even now citizens cannot move around with a tricolor on their car
 agar koi aam naagarik apane vaahan par tirangaa fahraata he, to wo gaiyr kanoonee he
 Action can be taken against such people
 vaahan ke alaava railgadee, naav or vayuyan ke upar, bagal yaa peeche tirange ko nahin fahraaya jayega
 If anyone does this, it would be illegal
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir kin logon ko apni gaadi par tirangaa fahraane kaa adhikaar mila he
 Who can put tricolor in their car? 1

 Lokpal Bill will be introduced in Lok Sabha today at 11 am
 congress bhale hi is bill ko apane bhrashtachar virdohi sankalp kii jeet maan rahi ho
 Opposition to the bill continues in and outside Parliament
 lekincongresis bill ko lekar puri tarah se santusht he or party kaa kahana he ki wo sangharsh ko taiyaar he
 Sources have revealed that the government wants other parties to prove themselves against the bill during the debate
 bill paas na ho to dosha sarkaar par nahin sansad par aae
 The government is also considering a strategy to take advantage of the ruckus and clout of parliamentary rules
 agar ye baat sach he to sarkaar soch rahi hogi ki aisa karke wo bill ko agle saal tak ke liye taal de
 In such a situation, the sword of opposition to Anna in the entire dispute will not fall only on the Congress
 congress ne apane saansadon ko bill kaa sinopsis bantwa diya he
 It is clear that the party wants its people to be fully prepared to present their views when there is a debate in the Parliament
 lokapal par charchaa ke lievinter seshanko teen din ke liye badha diya gaya he
 Parliament will also run on 27, 28 and 29 December after the holiday
 sarkari bill se team anna naarazlokapal par sarkaar ne jo bill taiyaar kiya he, aaj sansad main use pesh kar diya jayega
 However, neither Team Anna is happy with this bill and no opposition
 lekin sarkaar kaa daawa he ki wo isi satr main ise paas kara legi
 However, there is preparation for a war from Parliament to the road
 jo kaam pichley 43 barason main nahin ho sakaa, wo ab hone ko he
 The bill for the largest law against corruption in India will be tabled in Parliament today
 ek aisa bill, jise lekar pichley 9 maheene se lagaataar chal rahaa he andolan
 a bill whose demand created public outrage across the country
 ek aisa bill, jise lekar centre sarkaar kii naa jane kitni baar fajihat bhi ho gai
 a bill for which Anna has gone on hunger strike thrice and is preparing for the fourth fast
 standing cameti kii report main baari pherbadal karte hue ab sarkaar ne ek bill to taiyaar kar liya he
 However, neither the team Anna is happy nor the opposition on the bill that has been prepared
 jis team anna ne lokapal ke liye aawaaj buland kii he, wo team anna sarkaar ke lokapal ko sire se khaarij karti he
 But the government claims that it is fulfilling all the promises it had made
 lekin, sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholane vaali team anna ne ab ye iljaam lagaana bhi shuru kar diya he ki darasal sarkaar ko logon kii parvaah nahin, wo to utana hi karti he, jitna sonia or rahul unase karne ko kehete hai
 Sonia takes over, reinforcing Sonia's support for Morchalokpal's current bill
 Her speech at the parliamentary party meeting, in which she gave the Lokpal a look and electorate with other government schemes
 sonia ne kaha congress ab 2009 ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr se zyada kar chuki he
 Overall, the situation is that like every other time, this time there are many obstacles in the way of Lokpal
 bill abhi loksabhaa main pesh bhi nahin hua he or bakheda shuru ho chukaa he
 The Congress has started saying that the government is serious and the BJP feels that the government is not running
 jaahir he ab sawaal yahi khadaa hota he ki aakhir kya hoga is lokapal kaa
 Will this law be enacted in 2011 and if it is made, then how will it be made
 sarkaar kii gupt ranneetisarkaar kii ranneeti saaf he ki saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi naa toote
 The opposition has started an uproar over the bill that has been made
 aise main ashanka he ki bill par agle teen dinon main shaayad hi bill paas ho paae
 Obviously, the government is trying to show that it is serious
 lekin baaki logon kii bhi to jimmedaari he
 On the instigation of Sonia, the government defeated Anna
 par sansad ke bheetar use sonia ke bill ko badalane se bhi bachaana he
 In such a situation, the strategy of the government within the House is very complicated due to which it wants to hit many targets with one arrow
 sarkaar chaahati he ki agle teen din main uske alaava duusare dal bhi bill virdohi sabit hon
 If the bill is not passed then the blame is not on the government but on the Parliament
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik sarkaar hangaame or sansadeey niyamon kii aad kaa phayda uthaane kii ranneeti par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 If this is true, then the government must be thinking that by doing so, it will defer the bill for the next year
 aise main puure vivaad main anna ke virodh kii talwaar keval congress par nahi giregi
 Some calls for this strategy have been heard in Parliament
 jo mahila aarakshan bill ke hashr kii yaad dilaati hai

 Hi
 
 
 main raveesh kumaar
 Padma is Sachdev, comes from Jammu and Kashmir and is a famous litterateur
 unase maine poocha ki aapane jhelum main aisi tabaahi dekhi he
 His answer was that we have seen floods, but have not seen many floods
 mujhe to vah nadi sust gabhin gaay kii tarah leti hui lagati he
 Flows slowly
 chenab kii tarah hiloren nahin uthati usamen
 The name Jhelum derives from a town in Punjab, Pakistan, through which Jhelum passes
 bhartiya upmahadweep kii puraani nadiyon me se ek he jhelum jise vitasta bhi kehete hai
 In Kashmir, it also has the name Apabhramsa Vyath
 jaise aap vyathaa bolte hai
 We also asked senior journalist Jawahar Lal Kaul about the conduct of this river
 unhone bhi apni yaadon ko tatol kar kaha ki jhelum to bahut shant nadi he
 There used to be floods in it, but it entered our courtyard as if it had got permission
 kaul sahab ne bataaya ki azaadi ke baad kii yah badi tabaahi he
 Srinagar was flooded in the 90s, but its scale was very small
 jhelum yaa vitasta kii sahaayak nadi doodh ganga jo srinagar ke paas jhelum main milti he, vah ugr ho gai or baandh tod diya
 Kaul Saheb also said that the level of Dal Lake in Srinagar was above Jhelum
 dal kaa pani jhelum main jaataa tha, lekin ab jhelum kaa pani dal main aane laga he
 Those who have seen Jammu and Srinagar are telling that the flow of fifty bridges is telling that people had forgotten that rivers also flow in this state
 sainkadon kilometre kii sadaken bah gai hai
 Our engineering to management has been exposed
 aakhir shant si bahane vaali jhelum itani ugr kyon ho gai? vah kosi kii tarah kyon dehshat paidaa kar rahi he? srinagar ke kisi bhi mohalle kaa naam lijie duba hua he
 Many districts around Jammu are in the grip of floods
 poonch, rajori, udhampur main bhi janmaal kaa nuksaan hua he
 One million people are said to be affected
 jammu shahar kaa pathankoth se sampark tut gaya he
 The administration closed three bridges on the Tawi River
 chauthe pul main bhi nuksaan hone kii khabar ai he
 The devastation is so widespread that nothing could happen without the army
 laajawab kaam kiya he sena ne
 The Army and the NDRF have worked together in rescue and relief under adverse circumstances
 qareeb tees hazaar logon ko surakshit jagahon par pahunchaaya gaya he
 This operation is not like the Kedarnath incident of last year, but is going on a very large scale
 ek vakt to srinagar ke ram munshi baag main jalastr pachis feet upar chalaa gaya
 It is historical
 yahaan 17 feet ke baad baadh maan lee jaati he
 If the water level in Ram Munshi Bagh is 26 feet, then water will be filled in the Dal, which is already full
 ram munshi baag ke alaava sangam asham main jal str mapa jaataa he
 Scale has sunk in all three places
 sangam main bhi jal str khatre ke nishane se dasiyon feet upar bah rahaa he
 There is news of water depletion from many places, but now if water increases here, the water of Dal and Jhelum together will cause deep damage to Srinagar
 yahaan kii sadakon par gaad jamaa ho gai he
 High Court, Secretariat, Lal Chowk have all drowned
 aspataal bhi dub gaye hai or in tak pahunchane kaa rasta bhi
 It is a matter of relief that reports of shortage of water have started coming up in Srinagar, yet some areas are having enough water
 aaj barish bhi nahin hui he, phir bhi khatra tala nahin hai
 Jammu and Kashmir needs relief material in large quantities
 patna, gandhinagar, ghaziabad or dilli se naaven pahunchaai gai hai
 Tents from Kanpur
 vayusena ke 23 vimaan or 29 helicopter anwarat bachaav kaary main lage hai
 There were also floods in 1992, 95 and 96, but this time ten to ten feet of water is flowing more than these years, then you can imagine how angry Jhelum and its tributaries are
 mausam vibhaag ne kaha he ki aaj se jammu kashmir main halki barish to hogi, magar musaladhar nahin
 It may bring some relief but it is not easy to deal with the disaster that has come
 puure rajya main sadaken bah gai hai
 Many districts have lost contact with each other and Srinagar with many districts
 chah dinon tak hone vaali musaladhar barish se rajya main kitna nuksaan hua he iskaa turant andaaza nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Phone, electricity and drinking water supplies are at a standstill
 sena or andiaref satellite phone se kaam chalaa rahe hai
 In a village in Udhampur, more than twenty houses were washed away due to landslides
 30 se zyada gramin malbe main hi dab gaye
 In our news room, people are constantly calling and informing about where they are stranded in their own Srinagar or Jammu
 bachaav dasta abhi bhi saare logon tak nahin pahunch sakaa
 People have finished their important things
 is vakt jab sara rajya baadh main fansaa hua he, or centre rajya milakar logon tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ham bas yahi jaananaa chahenge ki vahaan hua kya? kya koi vishesh badlaav aayaa ki jhelum ne srinagar ko duba diya
 Why did such flood come in sixty years? What can be done now for relief and rescue? pradhanmantri ne is rashtriya aapadaa ghoshit kiya he
 It is obvious that the devastation has happened so much that it will take several months for Jammu and Kashmir to recover from this

 When the finance minister reached the ministry, he surprised everyone, because he had a velvet red cloth in his hand instead of a red briefcase, which had a copy of the budget closed
 laal kapade main bharat kaa raashtra chinh bana hua tha or ise laal-pile riban se baandha gaya tha
 Now in India Today's special program budget roundtable, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman explained why she broke the tradition of briefcase
 unhone kaha ki brifex main bajet kii kapiyaan lekar arase se vitt mantri sansad pahunch rahe the
 But Indian tradition is not closely related to the briefs, so this time she came to Parliament with the budget copies wrapped in traditional red cloth
 unhone kaha ki bahi-khaataa or bhartiya parampara ek-duusare se behad najadik he
 However, the Finance Minister said that he had difficulty in pronouncing the ledger
 kyonki yah shuddh hindi ke shabd hai
 He said, i am still not able to pronounce the book correctly, nor do i know its true meaning
 ' kaarykram ke dauraan bhi nirmala sitaraman bahi-khaataa kaa uccharan karne main atak gayi, jiske baad wo khud hans padin or kaarykram main maujuud log bhi hansane lage
 He said that we changed the leather briefcases that have been coming in since the British era because i was getting negative signals from them
 bahi-khaataa se sthirataa kaa sandesh jaataa he
 The country's first full-time female finance minister said, 'I wanted to break out of this British tradition
 mujhe laga ki bajet ek pavitra dastavej he or ham apni pustakon ko varsh kii shuruyaat main devataaon ke saamne kaise rakhte hai, yah bajet ke saath bhi hona chahie
 Therefore left behind the tradition of Briefex
 'gauratlab he ki 1860 main britain ke 'chancelar of di excekar chif' wiliam ewart gladston financial papers ke bandal ko ledar bag main lekar aae the
 Since then, this tradition had come out
 britain ke vitt mantri apane saath laal rang ke ledar suutakes kaa istemaal karte hai
 In independence India, the shape and color of Briefx changed many times
 lekin pehali baar brifces kii jagah bahi-khaas lekar nirmala sitaraman sansad pahunchin

 Basit claimed that it was challenging for him to concede any Indian journalist to write articles in favor of Kashmir's right to self-determination until he met Dey who 'agreed' to it and he wrote one of his columns Wrote in, "now the time has come to settle this issue through a referendum forever
 ”purv rajdoot ke sansanikhej daavon par pratikriya dete hue de ne twitor par ek video main kaha ki saamaanya taur par unhone is tippanee ko bina pratikriya die nazarandaaj kar diya hota lekin jhooth kaa pardaafash karnaa bahut jaruri he

 South Africa has not done well in this World Cup so far
 pehle match main mejabaan england ne use maat di thi to duusare match main bangladesh ne uskaa manamardan kiya tha
 Looking at South Africa's World Cup history, it is called Chokers
 dakshin africa is thappe se peechha chhudaati nahin dikh rahi he
 The defeat against England is understandable, but bowing to Bangladesh has gone against his fame
 uski pareshaaniyaan kam bhi nahin ho rahi hai
 His main fast bowler Dale Steyn has been ruled out of the World Cup

 In the practice match against New Zealand, the Indian batsmen were shattered in front of the swing
 aise main dakshin africa ke do mukhya gendbaajon kaa na hona nishchit hi bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye raahat kii baat hogi
 Now the challenge of Kagiso Rabada will be important before him
 bhartiya ballebaaji kii lay sheersh-3 ke pradarshan par kaaphi nirbhar karti he
 If one of these three stands up to the end, then India's score is good
 beete do saal main yahi dekha gaya he
 In such a situation, the opening pair of Rohit sharma-shikhar Dhawan is a good start, while Virat Kohli has the responsibility to handle the team

 com / zerropu97r— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup)june 5, 2019number-4 ke liye rahul honge pehali pasandworld cap se pehle number-4 ko lekar kaaphi charchaa rahi thi
 Lokesh Rahul played at number four in the practice match against Bangladesh and scored a century
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki kohli apane pasandida rahul ko kam se kam pehle match main to number-4 par bhejenge varanaa kedaar jadhav bhi is sthaan ke liye vikalp hai
 If Rahul comes at number four, Jadhav can come at number 5 and then Mahendra Singh Dhoni at number 6
 chahal or kuldeep main kise milegaa mauka ?gendbaaji main kohli kin do tej gendbaajon ke saath utarate hai yah dekhnaa hoga
 It is quite likely that Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar will have Kumar on the field, but given the form of Mohammed Shami, Kohli may give him a chance in place of Kumar
 bumraah kaa khelnaa tay he
 India have the option of Hardik Pandya as the third fast bowler
 vahiin dekhnaa yah bhi dilachasp hoga ki kohli or mukhya coach ravi shastri leg spinner yujavendra chahal or chinamen kuldeep yadav kii jodi ke saath hi jate hai yaa anbhavi harfanmaulaa khilaadi rabindra jadeja ko mauka dete hai
 Hashim Amla's poor form is a big problem South Africa's bowling concern is new, but his old concern is his batting
 team kii ballebaaji kamjor he or quinton di cock or captain phalf du plasis ke alaava koi or ballebaaj badi pari khilne kii sthiti main dikhataa nahin he
 Experienced JP JP Duminy and David Miller make a good start, but are not able to reach it
 hashim amala kharaab form se baahar nahin nikal paa rahe hai
 While Dusen had scored a half-century against England, Markram played a good innings against Bangladesh
 plaing ilevan:bharat :rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli (captain), keel rahul, emes dhoni (wicketiper), kedaar jadhav, hardik pandya, bhubaneshwar kumaar, kuldeep yadav, yujavendra chahal, jasprit bumrahdakshin africa :quinton di cock (wicketiper), hashim amala, phalf du plasis (captain), raasi vine der dusein, david miller, jepi dumini, endile fehalukvayo, kris morris, cagiso rabada, imran taahir, tabrej shamsi Just think, there is a war between two countries
 donon mulk ke sipaahi aar-paar kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 Then the army of a country falls short
 jang ab najuk halaat main he
 If the army is in full numbers, then that country can win the war
 bhale hi uske desh main ladane ke liye or sipaahi naa hon
 There should be money, because with the same money, he can call the army on rent from another country
 ji haa, aapako shaayad yakeen naa ho
 But it is true that a very large country, in turn, gives its army on rent to fight many countries of the world
 syria main iesas aatankiyon ko khadedane ke liye chalaaya gaya ye oparation hakeekat he
 These pictures of this operation are true
 ve bagdadi ke aatanki hai yaa nahin
 But are they really Syrian army soldiers? Yes, take this question mark ie question mark very carefully
 kyonki isi main us chalaave kii sari kahani chuphi hui he, jo rus duniya se kar rahaa he
 He created a furore in Ukraine
 inhone syria main aatankiyon kaa maar bhagaaya
 These soldiers are not deception
 ye kiraye ke sainik hai
 That is all they are known for
 ye kahin bhi
 Anytime
 kisi ke liye bhi
 Let's fight
 badale main inhen paise milte hai or aadesh ye sirf headquater kaa sunate hai
 Who are these ukraine kii jang main ye vidrohiyon ke saath lade
 He supported the army in Syria
 ab ye sudan or madhya africa deshon main lard rahe hai
 And soon they will turn to Libya
 piemasi vegnar ke sainik hai
 That is, private military contractor
 rus kii ek nijee sainya company he, jo kiraye ke sainik taiyaar karti he
 And fights for her clients
 ab tak ye russian army, novorosia kii army, sirian armd force or irani armd force ke liye jang kaa contract lekar vahaan apane sainikon ko bhej kar koharaam machaa chuki he
 The enemies on whom he wreaked havoc in the money include the Islamic State, the al-nusra Front, the Free Syrian Army and the Army of Ukraine
 saal 2011 se lekar 2014 tak iesas ne syria ke zyaadaatar hisse ko apane kabze main le liya tha
 It seemed as if Damascus was also just coming out of the hands of President Bashar al-assad
 or unka takhta palat tay he
 But according to sources, an intelligence deal took place during this time
 ye deal thi kiraye ke in sainikon kii
 According to the deal, the PMC Wagoner will send its troops to the Rann of Syria, which along with the Syrian military will drive out the terrorists
 haa, badale main vegnar company ko acchhee khaasi rakam di gai
 But believe me, as soon as Wagner's troops stepped on the Syrian soil in 2014
 bagdadi ke ladaakon kii jaise shamat hi aa gai
 Within a year, these hired soldiers filled Syria's land with the bodies of these terrorists
 alam ye hua ki chand jagahon ko chhodkar puure syria se bagdadi ke aatankiyon ke paanv ukhd gaye
 And the rest of the work was completed by the Syrian Army
 haalanki ye khabar to nahin mili ki vegnar ne apane kitne sainikon ko syria ke front par bheja tha
 But it was found out that 18 soldiers died among his soldiers who killed thousands of soldiers
 syria main jang karne vaale vegnar sainik kaa kahana he ki hamaari tukdi palmaayra kii jang main shaamil hui
 First our team inspected the battlefield and then we went into the field with complete planning
 hamane hazaron aatankiyon ko maaraa
 But 18 of our soldiers were also killed
 ek saal main hamane vahaan kii sthiti par kaabo paa liya or sirian army ke liye rasta taiyaar kar diya
 Unlike other countries, such private military companies are legal in Russia
 aisa karne ke peeche rus kaa maqasad yuddh hone par kisi bhi apaat sthiti se nipatna he
 But officially the Russian authorities do not believe in the existence of Wagner or any other such company
 lihaaza ye baat maananaa to dur kii baat he ki uske kiraye ke sainikon ne duusare deshon main jang kaa theka liya
 According to defense expert Powell Felgenhour, Wagner apparently existed
 or uske tathakthith swayamsevak un tamaam yudhakshetron main nazar aate rahe hai
 Where the Russian government wants to send them
 donbas or syria iske udhaaharan hai
 But they have not been legalized
 rusi sarkaar bhale aisi kisi privet sena se inkaar kare
 But now after the disclosure of an agency, the world has come to know that Russia has established many such private army in its country to prepare for war
 saath hi wo in privet senaaon ko un jagahon par bhi istemaal karti he
 Where it cannot send its troops directly due to international pressure

 ranvir ne puraane jamaane kii romantic kahani vaali film luteraa main kaam kiya
 The film may not have earned much at the box office, but in this, he definitely convinced his acting
 ranvir kehete hai, “main 150 karod ru
 i would prefer to work in a film like Lootera instead of working in a film which is very enjoyable, and the audience will really enjoy it and appreciate the film
 ” ranbir kapur ne besaram main munhfat or shararti yuvak kaa role kiya he
 When he tried to become a masala hero, the audience reaction was not encouraging
 iskaa sandesh saaf tha ki bhedchaal kaa hissaa mat bano, balki apni raah khud banaao
 Without worrying about the film's earnings, both actors made their own distinct identities
 ye donon hi actor aise samay main bollywood main aae hai, jab star kii bajaae film kii kahani zyada pramukh ho gai he
 Both have shown that they do not want to be tied in the grooves of any romantic, action or comedy star
 isaki jagah ve apni pahchaan ek bahumukhi kalakaar ke rup main bananaa chaahate hai
 Two films of both are to come in 2014
 ranvir film gunde ke saath shuruyaat kar rahe hai, jo 1970 ke dashak kii filmon kii tarah acshan, naatakeeyata or romance se bharpoor hogi
 The next is Kill Dil, which is being directed by his master Maestro Ali

 She says, "it is easy because the audience wants new faces but we have to prove ourselves because we are not yet stars
" ”is tarah ranbir kapur, ranvir singh, pariniti chopra or aalia bhatta hindi cinema ke parade ko nai chamak dene ja rahe hai
 Although his career is just beginning, he is willing to take risks by joining with directors working on new ideas

 Parineeti says, "I used to think that i would not get a film until a big star would be there

 bharat ne ummid jataai he ki is saal ke aakhir tak jaish-e-mohammad ke chif masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit kar diya jayega
 Syed Akbaruddin, India's representative at the United Nations, said that India is working patiently on this and all options are being considered
 hamaare sahyogi 'india today' ke saath khaas baatcheet main akbaruddin ne kaha, 'ham sabar se lekin bahut saare sadsy deshon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We hope that with the cooperation of member countries we will be able to achieve our goal and that goal is to bring a terrorist who is running a terrorist organization
 ham aadha kaam kar chuke hai or ummid karte hai ki jald hi ise puraa kar lenge
 India had proposed after the Pathankot attack, India had proposed to declare Samud Azhar as an international terrorist before the UN Security Council Committee under Resolution 1267 this year
 pathankot main hue aatanki hamale ke baad bharat ne ye kadam uthaaya tha, jiskaa mastermind masood ajahar tha
 China had imposed a hurdle, although China, which had a close relationship with Pakistan, had stalled it
 pakistan ne koi bhi kaaran die bina is par aage badhane se inkaar kar diya tha or china ne aisa duusari baar kiya tha
 The ban imposed by China will end in December this year
 china ko yaa to sahyogi deshon ko isamen saport karnaa hoga yaa phir wo is rejolution ko block karne ke liye apni vito power kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 China will not be able to put up after December, says Atangasayed Akbaruddin has hoped that the matter will gain momentum by the end of this year, as the organization of jaish-e-mohammed, Masuz Azhar, already has a banned terrorist organization
 aise main masood ajahar ko bhi aatankwaadi ghoshit kiye jane ko lekar bharat kii ummiden bad gai hai
 Akbaruddin said, 'he (china) initially asked for a technical hold for 6 months and after that he asked to extend it for another 3 months
 teen maheene kaa vakt is saal ke ant main khatm ho rahaa he
 We hope that at the end of this year, we will get the gift of declaring him a terrorist in the UN
 ' This year, Nandkishore Acharya, who was awarded the Sahitya Akademi for his collection of poems 'peelte Apne Ko', is the youngest Hindi writer of the Akademi Award in the last three years - just 74 years old
 varanaa beete saal yah sammaan 75 saal kii chitra mudgal ko mila or uske pehle vaale saal 86 saal ke ramesh kuntal megh ko
 In fact, for the last five-seven years, going to the D
A
, remembering the missing seniors like Sahitya Akademi Award in Hindi 
 isse yah udhaas karne vaala khyal aata he ki kya hindi lekhakon ko sahitya academy jaisaa majhola puraskaar bhi tabhi mila karegaa, jab ve avkaash prapti kii umr ke bhi 15, 20 yaa 25 saal paar kar chuke hon? pichley 12 saal main udai prakaash sambhawatah akele lekhak hai jinhen 60 saal se kam kii umr main yah sammaan mila
 Otherwise 90 writers of this period have also been honored
 agar sahitya academy sammaan praapt duusari bhashaaon ke lekhakon ko dekhen to yah vriddhavastha sirf hindi kii niyati lagegi
 Of course, this is not being said in the sense of any obnoxiousness or disobedience to senior writer Nandkishore Acharya or other writers, its purpose is simply to draw attention to the fact that the world of Hindi is not just lax in recognizing and recognizing its idols
 , But also keeps the narrowness
 nateeja yah hota he ki lekhak jab buzurg ho jate hai, jab unke liye sahitya academy jaisaa sammaan bemaani ho jaataa he, tab unako sahitya academy pradaan kar diya jaataa he
 This is also true of Nandkishore Acharya ji
 unki haisiyat sahitya academy se badi he
 He has been the author of the stunning and self-respecting tradition of Hindi
 apane liye kuch maangana yaa apni paatrata kaa bhaan bhi karana unhen apni garima ke anukool kabhi nahin laga hoga
 So the Hindi world went on to shore them up easily - perhaps one of the reasons is that they stand outside the leftist tradition of Hindi and are also against the right wing
 ve multah gandhivadi or samaajawaadee vishwaason ke lekhak rahe jinhen agyeya jaise viraat lekhak kaa bauddhik saannnidhya or lekhkeey saahchary hasil rahaa
 He was included among the poets of 'fourth Saptak', although it was the least appreciated among the Saptakas and along with it, the tradition of Saptakas also became intact
 lekin nandakishor acharya kai myanon main hindi ke anuthe kavi, lekhak or vichaarak rahe
 His prose was originally sharpened, but not offensive, thinking very spontaneously — and even juicing when needed
 'agyeya kii kavy titirsha' unke gadhy, unki aalochana or vichaar paddati ko samajhane ke lihaaj se ek pyaari si kitaab he
 In this book, he emerges as a penetrating, positive critic
 agar nandakishor acharya ke vipul rachanakarm par nazar daalen to ve multah kavi lagate hai
 At least one and a half dozen poetry collections are named after him
 vichaar or samvednaa kii jis saajha rassi se aksar agyeya apni kavita bunate the, vah apane sabase majboot rup main jin kaviyon ko viraasat main mili he, unamem nandakishor acharya bhi hai
 Often this sensation is seen very slowly acquiring a philosophical dimension here
 misaal ke taur par :'kavita sunai pani' shrunkhlaa kii apni ek kavita main ve likhte hai-'ek kavita sunai / pani ne chupake se dharti ko / Sooraj listened to him / Done the scene where his / the air was too low / Smelled by touching / The rhythm became sky / Singing to him / i was not able to give him / myself / He could not apana aap 
 'thinking in another way, his poem is about the thirst of Maruthal, the poetry of his soul
 is kavita main mitti yaa ret kii gandh bhi he or smriti kii suvaas bhi
 But they do not appear to be a memorial, but rather a slow and sensitive journey in which they have the patience to find footprints on the sand - and be patient to identify those who have disappeared
 aisi bahut sari kavitaayen unke yahaan hai jinako padhanaa samvednaa se vichaar, or phir vichaar se darshan kii yatra karnaa he
 At some one place they say that there can be no truth which is not even a dream
 darasal, yaheen lagata he ki multah yah kavi vichaarak he
 Of course, his thinker role is also unique in many ways, if not the best, in Hindi
 isi tarah unka naatakkaar rup unke baaki roopon se bilkul alag or anupekshniya he
 Many of his plays have been played and appreciated repeatedly
 yahaan bhi yah khyal aata he ki acharya ji ke vishad vyaktitv kii vajah se unke naatakkaar rup par jitne swatantra dhang se vichaar hona chahie tha, vah ho nahin paaya
 The fame of Sahitya Akademi as an institution has been greatly eroded recently
 jis daur main lekhakon par hamale ho rahe the, un dinon academy se apeksha thi ki vah inkaa virodh karegi, lekin is maamle main uski dhulmul bhoomika dekhte hue bahut saare logon ne apane puraskaar bhi waapas kiye
 Not only this, right-wing trends were also affected by its rewards
 yah daur vaise bhi sahitya or abhivyakti ke lihaaj se kaase sankat kaa daur he
 But the story of the collapse of institutions, which seems to be power-charged in other places, seems self-charged in the context of Sahitya Akademi
 lekhakon ke ek swytt or shashakt sanghathan ke rup main uski jo jeevant bhoomika dikhni chahie, vah dikhaai nahin padati
 But still it is an association of writers and this cannot be expected
 acha lagegaa agar sahitya academy apane lekhakon ke saath khadi ho or is mushkil samay main agar saajha pratirodh kaa na sahi to saajha vivek kaa manch bane
 UN AIDS in its most recent report released on Tuesday said that there has been a 16 per cent decline since 2010 globally

 The first suspect of the police in the case went to the housemaid
 andhere main chalaaya gaya yah waar sateek baitha or jab bhed khulne lage to sunne vaale vardidhariyon ke bhi hosh phakhta ho gaye
 The case was of ancestral land and the name of business leader Chandra Kumar Chhabra came to the center of this entire conspiracy
 police ne naukar or chhabda donon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 Why and how the plot of death was hatched In the Hussain Ganj area of UP capital, Pushpala Chhabra was murdered while sleeping in his house
 chaanbin hui to hatya ke peeche paison kaa khel saamne aayaa
 Pushpalata Chhabra, the lone mistress of crores of property, lived alone in one part of the house after her husband's death

 Chandra Kumar Chhabada is a businessman, while has also contested the election of mayor once
 yahi nahin, use samaajawaadee party ke ek netaa kaa kareebi bhi bataaya jaataa he
 According to the fear, the will and the assassination, Chandra Kumar had to face the fear of changing the will of Aunt Pushpala
 yahi kaaran he ki usne pushpalata kii hatya kii sajeesh rachi or katl kii yojana main naukar deepu ko shaamil kiya
 Chandra Kumar lured Dipu to 50 thousand rupees in lieu of murder
 pushpalata kii hatya ke baad police ko pehla shaq naukar deepu par hi hua
 After rigorous interrogation, Deepu opened the entire case
 usne kaha ki chandra prakaash ne chachee kii hatya is tarah karne ke liye kaha tha, jisase ki yah saamaanya maut lage
 As part of the plan, Deepu wanted to press the sleeping floss's mouth with a pillow, but then the wreath woke up and started struggling
 mauka haath se jaataa dekh, deepu ne pushpalata par ek ke baad ek mukke kii barish kar di or tab tak martha rahaa, jab tak ki uski saans ne saath nahin chhod diya

 desh kii satta par duusari baar apni badshahath kaayam rakhane ke liye bijepi gujarat model par aadhaarit 'no ripet theory' par kaam kar rahi he
 Under this strategy, the BJP is going to cut the ticket of its existing mps in large numbers and bet on new faces
 isi 'gujarat model' ke jariye bijepi pichley do dashak se gujarat kii satta par kabiz he
 The BJP has been in power for five years under the leadership of Narendra Modi
 upi, gujarat se lekar madhya pradesh-chhattisgarh or rajasthan main badi sankhya main bijepi ne jeet hasil kii thi
 It is bound to be an anti-incumbency trend against the current BJP mps
 bijepi ne anti inkamabency se paar paane ke liye badi sankhya main puraane saansadon kii jagah nae chehre ke saath siyaasi ranbhumi main utarane kaa man banaaya he
 In many states, BJP is cutting the ticket BJP is going to cut the tickets of the sitting mps in more than half the seats in Uttar Pradesh
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne upi kii 80 siton main se 71 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 In such a situation, the party can bet on a new face by cutting the ticket of about 40 mps
 aise hi chhattisgarh main bijepi apane sabhi 10 saansadon kaa tikat kaatane kaa faisla kar chuki he
 In the last election, it was successful in winning 10 out of the 11 seats in the state

 BJP national president Amit Shah is busy finalizing the list of candidates for the Lok Sabha
 mana ja rahaa he ki ek- do din main ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan bijepi kar sakati he
 The BJP has planned to place bets on strong leaders who fit the political equation and have the potential to win the electoral battle

 Even before this, new candidates have been replacing the old faces

 The second time ticket was not given to non-working and legislators surrounded by corruption and crime charges
 ab isi ranneeti ke tahat loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bijepi ne badi sankhya main apane saansadon kaa tikat katkar unke khilaaf kshetra main bane anti inakambency ke asar ko kam karnaa he
 Under the same principle, BJP is working on the strategy of landing in Lok Sabha elections with new faces instead of old faces
 MCD ke chunaav main bijepi ne kaate tiktadilli ke nagar nigam chunaav main isi formule ke jariye fatah kiya tha
 In the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections, the BJP had made possible the impossible victory of MCD by cutting the ticket of all the councilors and replacing them with a new face

 bijepi ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri divi sadanand gauda ne 11 vidhayakon ke istife par kaha ki vidhayakon ko lagata he ki is party (congress-jedies) se baahar aane kaa yah behatar mauka he
 That is why these people have resigned, because they feel that the state and their constituency as a legislator is not good for them

 The democracy of the country follows the Constitution and the Supreme Court interprets the nuances of the Constitution and the law

 Dalits argue that this decision weakens the SC-ST Act
 sawaal ye he ki agar aisa he to ye sanghathan sidhe supreme court main ja sakate the
 The political parties that encouraged them to shut down and protested and the veteran lawyers sitting in them could also go to the Supreme Court and plead
 lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya kyonki in partiyon ko raajnneeti kerani thi
 Apart from the 2019 general election, elections for many states are coming

 People of the states of Madhya Pradesh, Western Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc

 ye jaruri nahin ki supreme court kaa faisla lokapriy bhi ho kyonki vahaan bhavukta or votbank ke aadhaar par nahin balki kanoonee or sanvaidhanik bindu ke aadhaar par hote hai, unako sadak par updrav machaakar palata nahin ja saktaa
 If the people of the society or political parties are thinking of doing this, then they should think their future because in the near future, the Supreme Court will have to come to judgment on matters like Ayodhya case, halala-mutawiwah and multi-marriage among Muslims, Article 377
 court ke faisle tushtikaran kii buniyaad par nahin honge or na hi sankhyabal ke aadhaar par
 Violence can occur from both sides and can go to any level
 jis votbank kii raajnneeti chal rahi he wo aise hi hoti rahi to desh main ganatantr aa jayega or jo kuch aazaadee se hasil kiya he vah mitti main mil jayega
 The Act is not going to weaken the verdict as far as the SC-ST Act is concerned, the Court has not weakened it, due to its misuse, it has made a slight change in the rules
 agrim jamaanat dene kii baat court se pehle bhi aa chuki he or maamle kii praathmik jaanch ke baad giraftaar kaa praavdhaan har cese main he
 In the SC-ST Act, if the court says that the DSP level inquiry officer is expected to take a prudent decision, it is already in the provision of the Act
 jahaan tak tatkaal giraftaar kii baat he to murder ke cese main bhi tatkaal giraftaar nahin hoti he

 Taking a dig at the Yogi government, the BSP supremo said that when the government knew that these 17 castes could not get the benefit of Scheduled Castes, then why did the government take such a decision? It is clear that the Yogi government has issued this order to cheat these 17 castes like the SP government
 bispi adhyaksh mayawati ne kaha ki yogi sarkaar kaa faisla 17 obisi jatiyon ke logon ke saath dhokhaa he
 These people will not be able to get the benefit of any category, because the UP government will not consider them as obcs

 jo bhi ladki unki ingandi harkaton kaa virohakarti, vah uskaa research work baadhit kar dete the, jaisaa ki unhone mere saath kiya
 i am very tense and worried because i have to submit my research in July

 ab sawaal he kya england is badi haar ko bhuulaakar australia ko agle test main takkar de paaegi? England batsmen flopped completely at Lord's
 england apni pehali pari main 312 ran bator saki
 Captain Alastair Cook tried to stay on the pitch but his innings could not progress beyond 96 runs
 26 july se shuru hone vaale tisare test se pehle english captain ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 From batsman's form to finding tips on winning the toss
 toss jeetne ke bare main elister cook ne kaha, 'qareeb 15 yaa 16 baar main toss haar chukaa hum, iskaa mujhe bhi aashcharya he
 It is important to win the toss in the Test, but that does not mean that i am ignoring the good performance of the Australian players
 agle test main muqaabala zordaar hoga
 ' series ke pehle test main maat khaane ke baad australia ne 67 saal main sabase badi jeet hasil karte hue zordaar vaapasi kii
 Apparently, the team's coach Darren Lehman is very happy
 lekin wo english team kii palatwaar karne kii taaqat se bhi khub vaakif hai
 Australia coach Darren Lehmann also admits to the strength of England
 unke mutabik english team ko gharelu maidan par maat dena mushkil hota he
 If our team plays with the same vigor we played at Lord's, the result will be in front of everyone
 mere khyaal se england kii team puri taaqat se vaapasi karegi
 The comments cardiff main haar ke baad mehmaan team ne apni sabhi kamiyon se nijaat paa liya he lekin lords main openar kris rogers ko sir main lagi chot zarur fikr kii baat bani hui he
 According to the coach, Rodgers is fine but the decision on his playing will be taken by the team doctor
 landan main doctoron ne rogers kaa chekup kiya jisaki medical report aana baaqi he
 However, along with the Australian coach, the players also want to return to Rodgers' team
 unke mutabik english pichon ko khilne kaa sabase zyaada anubhav rogers ko he
 In such a situation, his return in the third Test is very important for the team
 pari kii shuruyaat main english gendbaazon ko rokane kaa zimmaa rogers ne donon test main bakhubi nibhaayaa
 In such a situation, the Australian captain and coach must be asking for his quick fit
 lords main england ke ballebaaz puri tarah se flop rahe
 England were able to score 312 runs in their first innings
 captain elister cook ne pich par tikne kii koshish zarur kii lekin unki pari bhi 96 ran se aage nahin bad saki
 The English captain has several challenges ahead of the third Test starting on 26 July
 ballebaazon ke form se lekar toss jeetne ke nuskhe talashna tak
 Regarding winning the toss, Alastair Cook said, 'I have lost the toss about 15 or 16 times, i am also surprised
 test main toss jeetna ahm ho jaataa he lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin ki main australian khilaadiyon ke achche pradarshan ko nazarandaaz kar rahaa hum
 The competition will be stronger in the next Test
 ' Australia bounced back after winning the first Test of the series with the biggest win in 67 years
 zaahir he isse team ke coach darren lehaman kaafii kush hai
 But he is also well aware of the strength of the English team to reverse
 australia ke coach darren lehaman bhi england kii taaqat ko maanate hai
 According to him, the English team is difficult to beat on home ground
 hamaari team jis josh ke saath lords main kheli usee josh ke saath agar aage bhi khelti he to nateeja sabake saamne hoga
 i think the England team will come back with full force
 tippaniyan After the defeat at Cardiff, the visiting team has overcome all its shortcomings but head injury to opener Chris Rodgers at Lord's remains a matter of concern
 coach ke mutabik rogers thik hai lekin unke khilne par faisalaa team ke doctor lenge
 In London, doctors checked Rodgers, whose medical report is due
 vaise australian coach ke saath-saath khilaadi bhi rogers kii team main vaapasi chaahate hai
 According to him, Rodgers has the most experience of playing English pitches
 aise main tisare test main unki vaapasi team ke liye kaafii mahatvapurn he
 Rodgers played well in both Tests to stop English bowlers at the start of the innings

 You will also take your children to the zoo
 bachapan main khud bhi gaye honge
 It is really nice to walk around the animals and watch them wander
 lekin yah acha tabhi tak lagata he jab tak hamen yah puri tarah se vishwaas ho ki is vicharan main ham bhi surakshit hai or pashu-pakshi bhi
 But what happened at a zoo in Tokyo will probably be a long time witness
 soshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he jise dekhakar aap ek pal ke liye chaunk jaaenge
 a child in yellow dress who came to visit the zoo was looking at the lion across the glass wall
 vah jaise hi mudane laga ki achaanak dur baitha sher uski ore chalaang lagaate hue dauda or kaanch kii diwaar par nakhun-se maarane laga
 What would have happened if there had not been a glass wall between the child and the lion
 
 
 aap soch sakate hai
 However, the lion also turned around after a second
 sher ke panjon se bachanaa mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin ho saktaa tha agar bich main yah kaanch kii diwaar na hoti
 The video was made at the Chiba Zoological Park in Tokyo
 haalanki chidyaghar ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki vah sher jab bhi bacchon ko dekhtaa he aisi hi vyavhaar karata he
 He feels that the lion will have a 'play intention' with the children
 tippaniyan You will tremble after watching this incident of a few moments in the video
 
 
 chidyaghar ghoomane aae pili dress pahane ek baccha kaanch kii diwaar ke paar sher ko dekh rahaa tha
 As he turned, suddenly the lion sitting far away ran towards him and started hitting him with nails on the glass wall
 bachche or sher ke bich yadi vah kaanch kii diwaar na hoti to kya hota
 
 
 You can think sher bhi haalanki second bhar baad hi mud gaya
 Avoiding the lion's claws is not difficult, it would have been impossible if it had not been a glass wall in the middle
 yah video tokio ke chiba zoological park main banaaya gaya
 However, zoo officials say that the lion behaves in a similar way whenever it sees children
 unhen lagata he ki sher bacchon ke saath 'khilne kii manshaa' rakhata hoga
 The comments video main kuch palon kii yah ghatana dekhakar aap kaanp jaaenge

 jab do secular dal aapas main ladate hue apana makasad sampradayikta se ladanaa bataaen to samajhie ki chunaav aa gaya he
 Secularism is the fundamental element of Indian politics that political parties have turned into football
 kabhi secularism ke naam par morche bana karte the, ab ise lekar morcha banane vaale aapas main lard rahe hai
 The problem is why the parties that distribute electoral life insurance of secularism only talk to the representatives of Muslim society
 unhen hi kyon aashwaasan dene jate hai
 Have you ever seen such a meeting in which people of majority society have been called and leaders are saying that we have to end majority communalism
 bina bahusankhyak sampradayikta se lade koi kaise alpsankhyakon ko aashwaasan de saktaa he
 Do not see any party in these pictures
 har dal kareeb-kareeb yahi karte hai
 The victims of communalism are Sikhs as well as Christians
 magar na to unase koi sartificket lene jaataa he na vah dete najar aate hai
 That is why if it was not a basic element, then all the parties would not have advocated it right for show
 matlab ki yah jaruri he or yah bhi jarur he ki iske naam par herapheri zyada hui he jameen par ladaai kam
 Arvind Kejriwal also visits Muslim intellectuals in Delhi on Monday and says that communalism is a bigger threat than corruption
 kehete hai agar dangon main hamaara parivaar khatm ho gaya, to phir sab khatm ho jaataa he
 On Tuesday, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley also meet representatives of Muslim society in Delhi
 sammelan kaa naam he- 'narendra modi mishan 272 plus role of muslim summit'
 bjp's national president says that whatever we have kept by putting hands on the heart, whatever questions arise in your mind, you can ask where ever there was a mistake, if there was any mistake or omission on the part of the people, then i assure you that we will bow down and apologize
 vaise aap dashark khud se sawaal kiijie ki sikh dangon par maafee se insaaf miltaa he yaa sajaa dene se
 Does communalism end with the apology of a leader for the Gujarat, Delhi, Muzaffarnagar riots
 maafee ke naam par kahin ek duusare ko maaf karne kaa khel to nahin chal rahaa
 How is the idea of banning political parties like the leader involved in the riots
 ab chalate hai patna, jahaan secularism kii ladaai ek agyaat va automatic dalbadal ke jariye ho rahi he
 Within 24 hours, Lalu Yadav discovered nine of his 13 mlas and sat on a rickshaw, saying that Nitish was weakening his fight against communalism at the behest of the BJP
 nitish kehete hai ki vah to endie-bijepi se alag hue hai
 We cannot compromise on communalism in any way
 chiraag paswan kehete hai ki pita ramvilas paswan ne mujh par faisla choda he
 Narendra Modi has got a clean chit
 udhar aaj dilli main 11 dal jamaa hue yah kehete hue ki ve gaiyr congress or gaiyr bhaajapa he
 Jayalalithaa's AIDMK, BJD, SP, JDU and AGP
 inke bich siton kaa samjhauta nahin he
 The prime ministerial candidate is not decided, but Jayalalithaa's party in Chennai celebrates her birthday cake by cutting the Parliament and passes the proposal to become the Prime Minister
 twitor se praapt is tasviir main jayalalita pradhanmantri ban chuki hai or duniya ke tamaam raashtra pramukh unako namaskara kar rahe hai
 In this poster, the President of Sri Lanka is seated in Jayalalithaa's footsteps
 videshi niti bhi final he bas morche kaa jeetna baaki he
 In Lucknow, the SP says that Mulayam Singh Yadav has to be made the Prime Minister
 sapa ne upie se samarthan waapas nahin liya he, magar morche main aa gai
 Prakash Karat said that we are united against the divisive communal policies of BJP
 bhrashtachar or aarthik nitiyon ke maamle main congress or bijepi main koi fark nahin he
 Sharad Yadav has said that we are one and this is the first front
 kya yah acha nahin hota ki is morche ko vishwasaneey banane ke liye ye sabhi 11 dal likhit halafanama dete ki nattejey kuch bhi aae ve is gathbandhan ko chhod kar nahin jaaenge
 Will the trust not go in support of Jayalalithaa Modi or will the BJP, which believes that the Third Front failed as a failed idea, no longer seek support from any of them
 bijepi ke ravishankar prasad ne kaha he ki kuch log jutate hai fate hue kapade kii tarah, usamen silaai or marammat karte hai or chunaav ke baad phir tut jate he
 This is the Third Front, Federal Front, New Front
 desh isse ub chukaa he
 By the way, UPA and NDA are also a front in themselves and there is a breakdown in them
 chunaav ke pehle bhi or baad main bhi
 Mamata Mayawati, who claims to fight communalism, is not in any alliance
 bina voto kaa bikharaav roke vaicharik samatharnbaji se ye tamaam secularadal aapas main bhi ladate hue kiski madad kar rahe hai
 How does the public recognize who the real warrior is, against communalism

 ) The devastating floods in Bihar devastated the lives of many people, but the most painful story is that of Pinki and Phoolan, two women from Bhagalpur
 baadh ne in donon mahilaon par aisa kahar barapaaya ki apane pati or bete ke antim sanskaar ke liye in donon mahilaon ko bheekh tak maangana padaa
 If Aaj Tak showed this news prominently, it also had an impact
 raat ke 12 baje hi baadh peediton ke bich muaavja vitarit kiya gaya
 Not only this, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in Patna and DM Adesh Titarmare in Bhagalpur reviewed the relief work being carried out among the flood victims till 12 noon
 donon ko mila 4-4 lakh kaa muaavjabihar ke siem ne kii ghoshnaa ki sarkari rupayon par sabase pehla hakbaadh peeditonka, lekin bhagalpur ke rajandipur gaanv kii pinki or phulan kii dard bhari dastaan ne siem ke saare ghoshnaaon kii hawa nikaalkar rakh di
 In a government of good governance, if a woman had to beg for her husband and son's shraddhakaram, what could be a bigger tragedy? CM Nitish Kumar was very hurt after seeing this incident and immediately ordered the DM of Bhagalpur to immediately give Rs 4-4 lakh as assistance amount to both
 yaheen nahin, kotahi baratane waalon ke khilaaf bhagalpur kamishnar ko jaanch ke bhi aadesh de die
 The CM has a clear order that the death toll in the flood is to be given within 24 hours
 sio ne dikhaai maamle main laaparvaahibataya ja rahaa he ki sthaneey sio ne is maamle main kaaphi laaparvaahee dikhaai
 Pinki's husband and Phoolan's son died in the flood
 postmortem ke baad unkadah sanskaraho gaya, phir bhi sio kaan main tel daal kar baithe rahe
 On Friday, both of them had Shraddha Karma
 isliye wo bheekh maang kar unka karm kar rahi thim
 Both women are illiterate and no one was listening to his plea
 'ajtak' ne is maamle ko jab pramukhataa se uthaaya, to prashasan madad ke liye aage ai

 bhubaneshwar main yojit bhaajapa kii do-divasiy rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main shanivaar ko party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki party madhya pradesh, gujarat or karnataka ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi nirnaayak vijay hasil karegi
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made the media aware of what was said in the speech of the party president through a press conference
 unhone bataaya ki party adhyaksh ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki in chunaavon main kshetreey dalon ko na haraa paane kaa myth tutaa he
 Both regional parties lost together with the Congress in UP
 upi main 403 main 325 seat kaa jeetna is baat kaa pramanik udhaaharan he ki upi kii janata nirnaayak rup se bhaajapa ke saath ai he
 This result is a rejection of the politics of casteism, appeasement and familism
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki 'desh kii aazaadee ke baad se narendra modi desh ke sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 People believe in them '
 unhone kaha ki, 'ham yah apeksha karte the ki haare hue dal eemaandaaree se apni haar ko sweekaar karenge, lekin ab wo haarane kaa bahaanaa dhund rahe hai or us bahaane main iviem kii charchaa hui he'
 He asked the question: "when the UPA won in 2004-09, was the EVM good?" SP and BSP won in UP and BJP lost in Delhi, was EVM right? This kind of talking is like open humiliation of the election, instead of accepting defeat honestly
 ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki party adhyaksh ne rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main aahvaan karte hue kaha ki aaj bhaajapa duniya kii sabase badi party he, lekin ab bhi desh main bahut saare kshetra hai, jahaan bhaajapa ko aage badhanaa he
 So do not be lazy and all the people of the working committee will give 15 days time to the organization
 
 
 boothon par jaaenge or rahenge
 The National President himself will also visit the booths
 iske saath hi amit shah ne yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki wo aagaamee sitambar tak 95 din tak deshbhar main daura karenge or kaaryakartaaon se milakar, unase baat kar sanghathan ko majboot banane kii disha main kaam karenge
 He condemned the violence with BJP and Sangh workers in Kerala, Tripura and Bengal and said that after the formation of the Left government in Kerala, in view of the attack on BJP workers there, we have decided that if there is violence, we will make peaceful retaliation And the BJP lotus will blossom there
 tippaniyan Amit Shah also said that three years of Modi government are nearing completion
 is dauraan sarkaar ne jo kaam kiya anya sarkaron ko ye kaam puraa karne main do-teen kaarykaal lagate
 Apart from capital investment, farmer development, skill development, technological development, upliftment of the poor, many other development programs have been done in the country
 ham new india kii kalpana ke saath aage badhenge
 Along with this, he described the development of Orissa as a matter of concern
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se aahvaan kiya ki yah kaha gaya ki saal 2014 kii jeet ke baad bhaajapa apane charmotkarsh par pahunch gai, lekin bhaajapa kaa charmotkarsh aana abhi baaki he
 Today we have 13 Chief Ministers, but we imagine that we should have Chief Ministers in every state of the country
 2019 main hamen dobaaraa narendra modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa he
 There should be BJP rule at every level from panchayat to parliament
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne party adhyaksh ke bhaashan main kahi gayi baton se media ko ek press conference ke jariye avgat karaayaa
 He said that the party president said in his address that the myth of not defeating regional parties in these elections is broken
 upi main congress ke saath donon kshetreey dalon kii haar hui
 Winning 325 seats in 403 seats in UP is a testament to the fact that the people of UP have joined the BJP decisively
 yah nattejey jatvaad, tushtikaran or parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti kii asweekruti he
 He also said that 'narendra Modi is the most popular leader of the country since the independence of the country
 log unamem vishwaas karte hai'
 He said, 'we expected that the losers would sincerely accept their defeat, but now they are looking for an excuse to lose and in that excuse EVM has been discussed'
 unhone yah sawaal kiya ki 'saal 2004-09 main jab upie jiti to kya iviem thik thi? upi main sapa or basapa jiti or dilli main bhaajapa haari to kya iviem thik thi? is tarah kii baaten karnaa haar ko eemaandaaree se sweekaar karne kii bajaay chunaav ayeg ke khule niraadar ke samaan he'
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the party president called in the national executive meeting and said that today BJP is the largest party in the world, but there are still many areas in the country where BJP has to move forward
 isliye aalasy nahin karnaa he or varking cameti ke saare log 15 din kaa samay sanghathan ko denge

 Along with this, Amit Shah also announced that he will be touring the country for 95 days till next September and will meet the workers, talk to them and work towards strengthening the organization

 The comments amit shah ne yah bhi kaha ki modi sarkaar ke teen varsh puure hone vaale hai
 The work done by the government during this period would have taken two to three terms for other governments to complete
 desh main puunji nivesh, kisaan vikaas, kaushal vikaas, takneekee vikaas, garibon ke utthan ke alaava anya kai vikaas kaaryakam hue hai

 iske saath hi unhone urisa ke vikaas kii sthiti ko chintajanak bataaya
 He called upon the activists to say that the BJP reached its climax after the 2014 victory, but the BJP is yet to reach its climax
 aaj hamaare 13 mukhyamantri hai, lekin hamaari kalpana he ki desh ke har rajya main hamaare mukhyamantri hon
 In 2019, we have to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of the country again
 panchayat se lekar parliament tak har str par bhaajapa kaa shashan hona chahie
 He also said that 'narendra Modi is the most popular leader of the country since the independence of the country

 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke vishaal road sho ke dauraan party evam trinmul congress (TMC) ke samarthakon ke bich kolkata kii sadakon par jabardast jhadap ho gai thi
 However, Shah suffered no injuries and the police took him to a safe place
 tiemasi ne twit kiya ki derek obrayan, sukhendu shekhar raay, manish gupta, nadimul haq vaali trinmul sansadeey team kolkata main shah ke road sho ke baad bengal kii sampada par hue hamale ko lekar chunaav ayog se mulaakaat karnaa chaahati he
 Outside goons of the BJP set fire and broke the bust of Vidyasagar
 gauratlab he ki pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah par mangalvaar ko tikhaa hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki vah kya bhagwaan hai jo unke khilaaf koi pradarshan nahin kar saktaa
 Banerjee said this after clashes between BJP and Trinamool Congress supporters during Shah's roadshow in Kolkata
 is dauraan ishwarchand vidyasagar college main todphod or 19veen sadi ke samaaj sudhaarak vidyasagar kii pratimaa todane ke aarope bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon par lage hai
 Mamta Banerjee told reporters after visiting Vidyasagar College in North Kolkata that what Amit Shah considers himself? Are they on top? Is there a God who cannot do any demonstration against him? BJP President Amit Shah said, 'TMC goons tried to attack me
 mamata banerjee (pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri) ne hinsa bhadakaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin main surakshit hum
 Shah said that the police remained mute spectators during the clash
 unhone kaha ki police ne unhen bataaya tha ki rodsho kii ijaajat college ke paas samaapt hoti he or unhen swami vivekanand ke bidhan sarini ke paitruk awaas par le jaaya jayega
 Shah claimed, 'they (police) withdrew from the planned route and took the path where there was a traffic jam
 mujhe shradhanjali dene ke liye vivekanand ke awaas par nahin jane diya gaya or main isse dukhi hum
 On the other hand, Mamta Banerjee reacted to this and described Shah as 'goon'
 unhone shahar ke behaala kii raily main kaha, 'agar aap vidyasagar tak haath le jate hai to main aapako gunde ke alaava kya kahuungi
 He said, 'I hate your ideology, i hate your ways
 ' saath hi unhone vidyasagar kii aavaksh pratimaa tode jane ke khilaaf guuruuvaar ko ek virodh raily kii ghoshnaa kii
 Mamta said whether Amit Shah is above God that no one can perform against him
 is bich bijepi ne mangalvaar ko chunaav ayog se pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko rajya main chunaav-prachaar se rokane kaa anurodh kiya or aarope lagaaya ki vahaan 'sanvaidhanik tantra' dhwast ho gaya he
 a delegation of the party, including Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, reached the Election Commission after the violence and arson incident during BJP President Amit Shah's roadshow in Kolkata and demanded immediate intervention to ensure free and fair elections in the state
 Of
 nakvi ne mamata banerjee par kathith taur par bhaajapa ko nishaanaa banane ke liye hinsa main 'sahabhaagi' hone kaa aarope lagaaya or daawa kiya ki unhone trinmul congress ke apane kaaryakartaaon ko bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon par hamalaa karne ke liye 'uksaaya'
 Earlier this tension was heightened when a stone was pelted while passing through the Bidhan Sarani in North Kolkata for the residence of College Street and Swami Vivekananda of Amit Shah's convoy
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki college street par kalakatta vishvavidhyalay parisar ke baahar jhadap tab shuru ho gai jab ek samooh ne shah ke khilaaf narebaaji kerani shuru kar di
 (from input language) sansad cabajet satramen bijepi kii aguwai vaali endie sarkaar ke khilaaf puure vipaksh ko lamaband karne ke liye congress purajor koshish kar rahi he
 At the same time, Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee has not shown much warmth by the opposition, calling such efforts as 'routine exercise'
 bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko bajet vaale din vipakshi dalon kii baithak ke liye sonia gandhi ne aahvaan kiya he
 Talking to journalists in the state assembly, Mamta Banerjee said about the possible meeting of the opposition parties, 'I am not aware of this
 hamaari party kii sansadeey samiti ise dekhegi
 i am not going there because i already have many schedules
 har din wo ek saath baithte hai, ise zyada gambhirtha se naa liya jaae, ye routine maamla he
 According to TMC sources, mps Derek o'brien and Sudeep Bandopadhyay will represent the party
 party kaa ye rukh aisi atakalon ke bich aayaa he ki rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh banane ke baad se tiemasi apni taraf se congress se duuri banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The TMC has been expressing from time to time how the Chief Minister of West Bengal is in the best position to command the opposition to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 mamata banerjee ne buudhvaar ko tiemasi kii kor cameti kii baithak main chunaav funding ko lekar bijepi ke saath ek hi saans main congress kii bhi aalochana kii
 Mamta said, 'BJP is spending crores on digital (social media)
 yahi kaam congress bhi kar rahi he
 Remember that both parties have a lot of money
 is maamle main bijepi pehle number par he or congress duusare par
 Some parties are certainly not in power but they have raised a lot of funds for their use
 aisa hamaari jaisi partiyon ke saath nahin he
 'the India Today Conclave held in Kolkata last month emphasized the need for' collective leadership 'in the opposition to challenge the Modi-led NDA
 mamata banerjee kaa ‘federal front’ banane kaa sapana beshak adhuraa he lekin wo saaf taur par vipaksh kaa netritv karne kaa mauka congress ke haath main nahin jane dena chaahatin
 When Mamata Banerjee was questioned about the possibility of forming a grand alliance of opposition, she said, 'we are working together in Parliament
 main patna main lalu prasad ji se mili, mere uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke saath achche rishte hai
 We are also in touch with Stalin in Tamil Nadu and Naveen Patnaik in Odisha
 maharashtra main uddhav bhi mujhase milane aae
 There are good relationships with many more
 yahaan tak ki bijepi main bhi kuch logon ke saath mere achche rishte hai lekin sabhi ke saath nahin
 Mamta Banerjee did not react to Rahul Gandhi's recent promotion to the post of Congress President
 unhone bas itnaa kaha ki rahul yuva hai or unhen anubhav kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is certain that TMC is stepping on the issue of building an opposition front before the 2019 elections
 tiemasi bijepi ke baagi netaa yashavanth sinha ke ‘rashtriya manch’ kii baithak main to maujuud rahi lekin ensipi netaa sharad pavaar kii bulaai baithak se usne dur rahanaa hi behatar samajha
 After the summer holidays, the relationship between the judiciary ie the Supreme Court and the government will be normal
 kyonki ab collegium badla hua hoga, justise chelmeshwar ke ritair hone ke baad supreme court main jajon ke varishthata kram main ab number paanch justise arjan kumaar sikri kii collegium main entry ho chuki he
 In such a situation, a little ease can be expected in the ongoing strategic relationship with the government on the appointment of judges
 uttarakhand hoicourt ke chif justise ke em joseph ko supreme court laae jane ke sabase bade pairokaron main se ek justise chelmeshwar collegium main nahin hogen
 Although the Supreme Court is opening from July 2 after 43 days of summer vacation, it is estimated that the atmosphere will change now
 benchon main jaj badale honge, sarkaar ke saath talmail ke mudde bhi shaayad badal jaaen
 However, the issue of bringing Justice KM Joseph to the Supreme Court is likely to continue
 elahabaad hoicourt ke liye do varisht vakeelon mohammad mansoor or bashaarat ali khan ke naam kii collegium kii sifarish lautaane ke sarkaar ke faisle par bhi maamla funs jaae
 Among these two senior lawyers, Mohammad Mansoor is also the son of former Supreme Court judge Sagir Ahmed
 hoicorts main jajon kii niyukti ke liye supreme court ke teen jajon ke collegium ne 2016 main hi in donon naamon kii sifarish elahabaad hoicourt ke liye kii thi, lekin centre sarkaar ne do varsh tak in filon ko dabaae rakhane ke baad may main in tippaniyon ke saath in filon ko punarvichaar ke liye collegium ke paas bhej diya ki inke khilaaf kai shikaayatein hai
 Therefore, it should also be considered from this perspective
 supreme court ke puraane adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki ho saktaa he sarkaar ko ye nagavar gujara ho ki jin justise sagir ahamed ne apni report main kashmir kii swytta kii sifarish kii thi
 Article 370 also advocates how to give his son the green signal to become a judge of Allahabad High Court so easily
 baharhaal, mohammad mansoor chif standing council kii haisiyat se hoicourt main yogi sarkaar ke faislon or nitiyon kaa bachaav karte rahe hai
 Now how the mood of the collegium is on both these hot issues, it will be a matter of view, because now in the Collegium of the three senior most judges for the appointment of judges in the High Courts, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Madan B
 Lokur on these issues What kind of opinion do you have? gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki inamen se do to press conference karne vaale baagi dal main bhi rahe hai
 These three judges are also part of the collegium made for the elevation of judges in the Supreme Court
 bas in teenon ke baad usamen justise courian joseph or justise arjan kumaar sikri bhi shaamil ho jaaenge
 Justice Joseph has also been in the press conference faction
 lihaaja supreme court ke liye paanch jajon ke collegium main teen to tevar vaale jaj rahenge hi
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see how the attitude of Justice Gogoi is, as he is supposed to become the Chief Justice from October 2
 chif justise apane ritairement se kareeb ek maheenaa pehle apane uttaradhikari ke naam kii sifarish centre sarkaar ko bhejte hai
 In such a situation, their relationship with their rebel attitude and Chief Justice remains intact or fresh freshness comes after the holidays

 The challenge before the government is to give employment figures, on which work is going on
 aaj rojgaar ke tareeke badal gaye hai
 "PM Modi while talking about the employment figures said that CII and NASSCOM have reported that the employment has increased manifold than before

 tiwari) on May 22, 2017 at 2:16am PDT Between India and Australia, more mind games are played in the field than cricket
 itihaas gavaah he jab bhi in donon deshon ke bich koi cricket siries kheli jaati he, to khel se zyada jubaani jang kaa pradarshan kiya jaataa he
 In this interesting competition, players of both teams, whether India or Australia, do not like to be left behind
 kolkata vanade main bhi aisa hi kuch dekhne ko mila jab khel bhaavana ko taak par rakh kar khilaadi maidan par aapas main bhid rahe hai
 Actually, Team India was the first batsman to win the toss in Kolkata ODI
 bharat ke 3 wicket gir chuke the or krij par the viraat kohli or kedaar jadhav
 In the 33rd over of Team India's innings, a ball from Marcus Stoinis was missed by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, missed by Kedar Jadhav, and Virat Kohli, standing at the non-strike end, took 1 run
 is baat par pehle stoinis ne kohli ko kuch kaha uske baad mathew vade ne viraat kohli par jubaani hamalaa shuru kar diya, jo stump ke mike ne pakad liyakohali-vade ke bich hui bahes is video main dekhenmathew vade ne kohli ko kaha, “main tumhaari tarah dressing room main pareshaan ho saktaa hum or maidan par ro bhi saktaa hum
 Everyone will be sad for you
 jiske jawaab main kohli ne kaha, tumhaare dimag main jo bhi baat ho mujhe usase koi lenaa dena nahin he
 i want to score runs while batting on the field and those runs come from anywhere
 gauratlab he ki ye koi pehla mauka nahin he jab australian khilaadi maidan par apane pradarshan se zyada jubaani jang kaa sahaara le rahe ho
 Even before this, in the Border Gavaskar Trophy in the beginning of the year, there was a lot of heat on the field between the players of both the countries
 chitrakoot ke jangal main daaku lalit patel ne somvaar ko der raat teen bandhakon ko jinda jala diya
 He was abducted from Madhya Pradesh
 daaku kii talash main police combing kar rahi he lekin uskaa kahin pataa nahin he
 a few days ago, the bandits have also broken into a martyr's memorial of police in Banda
 upi-empi kii sarhad par in ilaakon main daakuon kaa aatank he
 Here he is writing a new story of crime every day
 chitrakoot ke kolhua ke jangal main taaja jaale hue teen narkankal milane se dehshat fail gai he
 Police reached the spot as soon as the news came
 ilaake ke dare hue log dabi jubaan main kehete hai ki madhya pradesh kaa inami daaku lalit patel or uski gang vahaan se gujri thi
 It is suspected that the three men, who were abducted by the robber on May 30 from the new village of Satna, have burnt them for not receiving the ransom
 jangal main mauka muyna ke liye pahunche banda ke diaiji gyaneshwar tiwari kehete hai ki, ”ho saktaa he ki inhen kahin or maaraa gaya ho or yahaan laakar ek saath jala diya gaya ho
 Now a thorough investigation is being done about it
 jo bhi yahaan avidence mili unako colect kiya gaya he
 Skull is collected
 diene sampling karai jaaegi or jo log gaayab hai unke parivaar waalon ke diene pareekshan karaae jaaenge
 Then it will be connected
 ” In these jungles of the UP-MP border, the bandits have increased significantly
 in ilaakon par lambey arase tak daakuon kii hukumat rahi he
 His profession is to kidnap people and collect ransom and cut all government contracts
 isi ilaake ke sabase bade daaku dadua ne yahaan 35 saal raaj kiya
 Its decree was run on 10 assembly seats here
 chunaav ke vakt jiske liye uskaa farmaan jari hota avam ko use vot dena padataa
 But here in the campaign against the dacoits, one by one all the big bandits were killed
 san 2007 main saat lakh kaa inami daaku dadua maaraa gaya tha
 In the year 2008, Thokiya, a five lakh prize robber, was killed
 saal 2012 main do lakh kaa inami daaku ragiya maaraa gaya or 2015 main paanch lakh kaa inami daaku balkhadia maaraa gaya
 But now again three gangs of bandits have become active here
 yah gangen aksar raaton main jangal main barish hone par gaavon main panaah lene aati hai
 The villagers have to feed the entire gang
 chitrakoot ke kolhua ke jangal ke paas rahane vaale rameshwar kehete hai ki, “are sahab pucho na
 
 raat ko khet hi nahin jate hai
 Crop animals are variable
 
 The doors of the house remain closed
 or agar raat ko daaku rahane aa jaaen to musiibat hi he
 If you refuse to give them shelter, then shoot the robber and if you give shelter then come on the target of the police
 gaanv waalon kii badi musiibat he

 Assam Public Works (APW), which filed the original petition in the Supreme Court, said the NRC would prove to be a 'defective document' as its demand for reverifying it was rejected by the apex court
 apidblyoo kii yachika par hi chah saal pehle rashtriya naagarik panji (enarasi) ko adhyatan karne kii prakriya shuru hui thi
 Abhijeet Sharma, president of the non-governmental organization (NGO) APW, also questioned the software's ability to manage documents used in the NRC updating process and asked whether it was inspected by a third-party technology expert? Sharma told reporters after the final NRC was released on Saturday, "the final NRC has decided that the issue of illegal migrants in Assam will never be resolved
 ise doshapurn tareeke se puraa kiya gaya jabaki yah assam ke itihaas kaa sunaharaa adhyay hota
 '19 lakh applicants are out of the last NRC

 The re-verification of 27 per cent of names by NRC state coordinator Prateek Hazela is a mystery
 koi nahin jaanata ki kya yah shat pratishat dosharahit he yaa nahin
 Questioning the software used for the process, Sharma said, "is it because of software with flaws because the names of 39 suspected families in Morigaon district also joined the NRC, which has been mentioned by the District Commissioner?" Significantly, in 2009, APW filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding the removal of the names of 41 lakh foreigners from the voter list and updating the NRC
