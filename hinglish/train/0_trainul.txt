 The decision to revoke Scheduled Tribe (ST) certificate of BJP MP Jyoti Dhurve from Betul in Madhya Pradesh has angered CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 sarkaar se jude sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri ne is sambandh main anusuchit jati evam janajati (SC-ST) kalyaan vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv ashok shah or ST vibhaag kii ayukta deepali rastogi ko talab kar jabardast jhaad lagaai
 According to highly placed sources in the Shivraj government, CM Shivraj was very upset that the department did not inform him before making his decision in this regard public
 bataa den ki madhya pradesh kii ek ucchstareey chaanbin samiti ne buudhvaar ko bijepi saansad jyoti dhurve kii anusuchit janajati praaanpatr ko nirast kar diya
 Dhurve, who was a Member of Parliament from Betul seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) category since 2009, in his election affidavit, stated his caste as Gond
 haalanki samiti kii jaanch main paaya gaya ki unhone jati ko lekar halafname main jhooth bolaa he
 The complaint was filed against the BJP MP by advocate Shankar Pendam of Betul district on 30 May 2009
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki jyoti ko jo gond jati kaa pramaan patr jari hua he, vah tathyon par aadhaarit nahin he
 The complainant had claimed that while taking the caste certificate, Jyoti did not present proper documents for her claim that she belonged to the Gond caste
 pendaam kii shikaayat ke baad up police adheekshak SC / ST kalyaan vibhaag dwaara is maamle main jaanch kii gai
 This investigation report was presented on April 1, 2017 and it was found that the documents presented by Jyoti did not match her claims that she belonged to the Gond caste

 According to the information received, CM Shivraj has called Dhurve to Bhopal to deal with the situation and discuss further strategies

 ' bihar kaa 'leningrad' or 'mini masco' ke naam se mashhoor begusarai loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main na sirf desh ke 'hot' siton main shumaar he, balki raajnneeti ke centre ko bhi apni ore modane main ab tak kaamyaab rahaa he
 The entire country is eyeing the Begusarai seat like Varanasi, Amethi, Rae Bareli and Wayanad
 loksabhaa chunaav ke is mahasamar main bihar kii siyasat kaa centre ban chuki begusarai seat ke lim lite main rahane kii vajah jeenyu chaatrasangh ke purv adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ke saath-saath baat-baat par virodhiyon ko pakistan bhejne kii naseehat dene vaale bijepi ke firebrands netaa giriraaj singh hai
 However, the candidature of RJD candidate Tanvir Hasan from Mahagathban also made the contest quite interesting
 kanhaiya kumaar pehle mahagathbandhan kii ore se maidan main utarane vaale the, magar tejasvi yadav kii ore se hari jhandi nahin milane kii vajah se mahagathbandhan ne kanhaiya ko apana ummidavaar nahin banaaya
 Since then, there have been such winds in political fissures in Bihar that why Tejashwi did not field Kanhaiya from RJD ticket, is Tejashwi afraid of Kanhaiya's popularity or is there some issue of youth representation? Many types of news floated in the media after the nomination was not made
 har koi apane anusaar is faisle kii vyakhya karata dikhaa
 Many things were done about Kanhaiya and Tejashwi, for example, both are young and Tejashwi does not want anyone in Bihar to stand up to a bigger young leader than him, etc
 agar begusarai aaj media kii surkhiyaan bator rahaa he, to isamen koi doraay nahin ki isaki vajah kanhaiya kumaar kii ummidavaari he
 Kanhaiya Kumar's candidacy has brought the Begusarai seat to the spotlight, it can be gauged how high the graph of Kanhaiya's popularity is and perhaps Tejashwi Yadav knows this very well
 raajnneetik vishleshak aisa maanate hai ki mahagathbandhan kii ore se kanhaiya kumaar ko tikat na milane kii vajah tejasvi yadav kaa raajnneetik dar bhi rahaa
 Tejashwi Yadav would never want someone in Bihar to appear before him, or a young leader who competes with him
 tejasvi ko shaayad is baat kaa dar sata rahaa tha ki agar vah kanhaiya ko tikat de dete hai, to kal hokar kanhaiya unki lokapriyata ko takkar dete dikh sakate hai yaa phir unke samaantar ek youth chhavi ko gadhate dikh sakate hai
 There are many reasons for this fear
 kanhaiya yuvaaon ke bich khaase lokapriy hai, isaki baangi vah kai manchon se dikhaa chuke hai
 Tejashwi Yadav also realizes that Kanhaiya's victory will make Kanhaiya more popular and will gain more edge
 saath hitejasvi yadav kii tulana kanhaiya kumaar se hone lagati
 Therefore, from a political point of view, in a way, it can prove to be a danger bell for the stunning
 kanhaiya kumaar or tejasvi yadav kii lokapriyata main buniyadi antar bhi he, jo janamanas ko achche se pataa he
 His father Lalu Prasad Yadav is behind the popularity of Tejashwi Yadav
 yun kahen to tejasvi yadav ko raajnneeti or lokapriyata unhen viraasat main mili he
 But this is not the case with Kanhaiya Kumar
 kanhaiya ne apane dam par lokapriyata hasil kii he
 Not only this, Kanhaiya also has no political legacy like Tejashwi
 tejasvi yadav ko bani banaai raajnneetik jameen mili, magar kanhaiya ne apni jameen khud banaai
 From Begusarai to Jawaharlal Nehru University, from the President of the Students' Union to the CPI leader, Kanhaiya Kumar has achieved everything on his own strength
 kanhaiya ne tejasvi yadav yaa anya netaaon se itar apni jameen khud banaai he
 This is the reason why Kanhaiya can compete Tejashwi in these cases too
 agar begusarai se kanhaiya ko rajd kaa tikat mil jaataa to tejasvi yadav ko phir inhen dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 The youth is showing sympathy for Kanhaiya
 raajnneeti beet ko cover karne vaale kuch patrkaar maanate hai ki begusarai main kanhaiya kumaar ke saath youth voter hi saath jate dikh rahe hai
 Because Giriraj Singh still dominates Bhumihar voters and RJD has its own vote bank, due to which the contest is triangular
 kanhaiya sirf begusarai ke yuvaaon ke bich hi nahin, balki desh ke vibhinn ilaakon ke yuvaaon ke bich bhi kaaphi femes hai
 Tejashwi Yadav may have also been aware that giving Kanhaiya Kumar a ticket from the RJD meant that he would have to put himself in front of another young leader who might later find it difficult for him
 kanhaiya kumaar kii padhai likhaai kii baat karen to tejasvi yadav se vah kaaphi aage hai
 Kanhaiya has a phd, while Tejashwi Yadav's qualification is still a matter of matriculation and non-matriculation
 is maamle main dekha jaae to tejasvi yadav ko bhavishya main is baat se bhi dikkat ho sakati he or counter nerrative taiyaar karne main kanhaiya ke paas tejasvi ke khilaaf yah behatar hathiyaar bhi ho saktaa he
 Within the RJD, there would be comparisons between Kanhaiya and Tejashwi Yadav and then if tested on many parameters, Kanhaiya can also win in this
 iske alaava, bhaashan kii kala main tejasvi yadav kanhaiya ke saamne kamjor sabit hote hai
 Kanhaiya has introduced this art in an argument with BJP spokespersons
 itnaa hi nahin, ve aksar bhaashanon main modi sarkaar or satta ke virodh main prakhar dikhte hai
 But there is no edge like Kanhaiya in Tejashwi's speech
 tejasvi yadav ko kanhaiya kii rajd se ummidavaari par ek or sabase badi dikkat ye thi ki kanhaiya kumaar abhi jeenyu main deshvirohi naare ke maamle main abhi aaropee hai
 If Tejashwi Yadav had given him a ticket, the BJP would have got a chance to say that the RJD was giving tickets to the alleged 'traitor'
 haalanki, yah baat alag he ki ab bijepi ne maalegaanv blast kii aaropee pragna singh thakur ko bhopal se digvijay singh ke khilaaf utaar diya he
 But Tejashwi Yadav did not want to give BJP a chance to attack RJD from anywhere
 iske alaava, tanwir hasan ne 2014 ke chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood jis tarah se pradarshan kiya tha, tejasvi is baat ko bhi nahin nakaar sakate the, kyonki vah is baat ko jaanate the ki bijepi kii ore se bhoomihaar jati se hi ummidavaar hoga or kanhaiya bhi usee jati se aate hai, aise main vah bich main apane puraane candidet par bharosa jataakar mukaable ko jeet sakate hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, RJD candidate Hassan gave a strong fight to BJP here, but he lost to Bhola Singh of BJP by more than 58,000 votes
 us chunaav main bhakpa ke rajendra prasad singh tisare sthaan par rahe the
 Bhola Singh got 4,28,227 votes while Tanveer Hasan got 3,69,892 votes
 baharhaal, begusarai kii raajnneeti jati par aadhaarit rahi he
 Bachwara, Teghda, Begusarai, Matihani, Ballia, Bakhri, Cheriabariarpur In the Begusarai Lok Sabha constituency comprising seven assembly constituencies, according to an estimate, out of 19 lakh voters, Bhumihar voters are around 19 percent, 15 percent Muslim, 12 percent Yadav and seven percent Kurmi
 yahaan kii raajnneeti mukhya rup se bhoomihaar jati ke aasapaas gumti he
 There is evidence that Bhumihar mps have been elected at least nine times in the last 10 Lok Sabha elections
 baharhaal, abhi beyisarai main sabhi ji tod mehnat kar rahe hai
 However, who will win in this interesting battle, it will be known only after the election results of May 23
 sanjay dutt ko maafee dene kii arji lekar amar singh or jaya pradaamangalvaar ko maharashtra ke rajyapal ke shankar narayanan mili
 Jaya Prada had sought time to meet the Governor two days earlier and today he went with Amar Singh and apologized for Sanjay Dutt
 jaya pradaa kaa kahana he ki wo kanoon kii izzat karte hai, lekin dutt parivaar ne is desh ke liye bahut kuch kiya he
 The Governor did not get any letter from Katju, President of Press Council, Justice Markandey Katju and Congress leader Digvijay Singh have also demanded to forgive Sanjay Dutt
 justise katju ne do din pehle maharashtra ke governor ke shankar narayanan naam khulaa khat likhaa tha
 But the Raj Bhavan of Maharashtra has said that the Governor has not received any letter from Justice Katju
 rajbhavan ke mutabik open letters likhane kaa ye matlab nahin hota ki wo chitthee rajyapal ko mil gai he

 lekin kanhaiya ne nyauta sweekaar karne se inkaar bhi nahin kiya he
 a mild tremor was felt in the Kashmir Valley on Saturday morning
 isamen janmaal ke nuksaan kii koi khabar nahin he
 Aamir Ali, coordinator of the Natural Disaster Management Unit, told that it was 5 in the Kashmir Valley at 9
46 am
 2 tivrata kaa bukamp mahasoos kiya gaya
 He said that the epicenter of the earthquake was the Hindukush region of Afghanistan
 is maheene ghati ko hilaa dene vaala yah doosraa bukamp he
 Earlier on March 12, a slight tremor of earthquake was felt in the valley
 vahiin duusari ore pakistan ke pashchimottar hisse main shanivaar subah bukamp ke jatke mahasoos kiye gayi
 Earthquake intensity 5 on the Richter scale
 4 maapi gai he
 There is no news of loss of life or property in the earthquake yet
 ham us desh main rahete hai jahaan kisi ajanabi ko koi or hamaare liye chun kar laata he
 The stranger performs certain rituals prescribed by the society and then gets the right that now those two people can have sexual relations among themselves
 vahi agar koi do log prem main hai or aapasi sahmati se shaareerik sambandh sthapit karte hai lekin samaaj se iske liye anumati nahin lete hai to wo 'vyabhichaar' yani kii 'edltri' kehalaayegaa
 And these days there is a debate in the Supreme Court about this adultery
 bahes is baat ko lekar chal rahi he ki agar koi purush kisi vivaahit mahila ke saath sambandh banaata he, us mahila ke pati kii anumati ke bagaiyr to yah dandaneey aparaadh he
 But the punishment is only for the man who has made the relationship, the woman is kept free from crime
 aise main soshal activist joseph shin jinhone court main yachika daayar kii he, unka kahana he yaa to purush ke saath-saath mahila ko bhi ipisi kii dhara 497 yani ki 'vyabhichaar' ke maamle main dand diya jaae, kyunki galati agar kii gai he to aapasi sahmati se kii gai he
 Why should only men be guilty in this case? Why not a woman? Otherwise, this law should be abolished
 supreme court kii taraf se abhi is baat par faisla aana baaki he magar centre sarkaar ne apana rukh saaf karte hue kaha he ki, vivaah naam kii sanstha bachi rahe isliye 497 kaa bana rahanaa jaruri he
 If Section 497 is repealed, the probability of deteriorating social structure will increase
 is saamaajik sanrachana ke banane or bigadane se pehle hamen ipisi kii dhara 497 ko samajhane kii jarurat he
 After all, when the Macaulay sat down to write a law about 150 years ago, he wrote a law keeping in mind his limited Indian knowledge
 is kanoon ke tahat agar kisi purush ne kisi duusare purush kii stri ke saath sambandh bana liya or isaki khabar yadi pati ko lag kai to vah isaki shikaayat kar saktaa he
 The penalty against which a complaint has been filed was imposed
 aaropee vyakti jurmaana bharkar mukti paa letaa tha
 Macaulay then excluded Section 497 from the offense category
 lekin kalantar main jab kanoonon main sanshodhan hua or nae kanoon bane to dhara 497 ko 'aparaadh' kii shrenee main daal diya gaya
 Under which provision of punishment of two to five years was made
 tab se le kar ab tak yah kanoon apane isi rup main barkaraar he
 It is worth noting that adultery is not considered a crime in Macaulay's country, ie Britain, whereas in India it is a malicious and social crime
 ab hamen samajhane kii darkaar he ki aakhir kab tak sadiyon puraane kanoonon ko ham dhote rahenge
 The petition which has been filed from above, under which instead of abolishing 497, women were also made a part of the punishment
 aise main mahilaayein hi duusari mahilaon par cese karengi
 Also, there is a mention in this section that if a man establishes a relationship with his wife by taking the permission of the husband, then he will not be placed in the category of crime or adultery
 yani ki pati se anumati le kar koi bhi uski patni ke saath sambandh banaae or patni kii rajamandi ho yaa na ho koi fark nahin padataa
 Then the probability of such a case increases, where the husband forces the wife to sleep with someone for her own benefit
 kitni dukhad baat he ki ek stri ko ye bhi haq nahin he ki wo apni marji se kisi ke saath apni khushi ke liye sambandh banaae
 Anyway, there is a tradition of remaining silent about sex in our country
 khaas kar wo striyaan jo in vishyon par apni aawaaj mukhar karti hai turant ye samaaj unke charitra par ungali uthaa detaa he
 Not only this, 497 also mentions that if a man makes an affair with an unmarried girl then he does not fall into the category of adultery
 vahaan is baat ko bhi saaf nahin kiya gaya he ki agar us purush kii pehle se koi patni he to use sambandh banane ke liye apni patni se anumati lene kii aavashyaktaa hogi yaa nahin
 That is, wives are the property of husbands
 unki apni abhilaashaa yaa kameksha nahin ho sakati kya? kyon nahin ye haq un do vayaskon ko de diya jaae jo aapasi sahmati se shaareerik sambandh sthapit karnaa chaahate hai? kyon jaruri he ki jisase shaadi hui ho usee ke saath hi sambandh bane?ho saktaa he or kai baar hota bhi he ki shaadi ke baavjood do logon main wo samaj yaa prem viksit nahin ho paati jiske baad un do logon main se kisi ek kaa kisi bahari vyakti yaa stri ke saath sambandh ban jaae, to isamen galat kya he? kyon har baar manushya kii ichha se upar saamaajik niyamon ko rakhaa jaae?jab koi bhi insaan chahen purush ho yaa stri apane saamaajik kartavyon ko nibhaate hue agar apni khushi se kisi ke saath sharirak sambandh banaata he to isamen samaaj ko kyon aapatti ho?kya apni khushiyon ke liye sochane kaa haq insaan ko nahin he? ab supreme court kii taraf se jo bhi faisla aae magar ek pragativaadee soch ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hamen kisi ko bhi is baat ke liye nicha nahin dikhaanaa chahie
 With whom and with whom it is a relationship, it is a private matter and not a social or criminal issue
 lekhika anu roy mahila evam bal adhikaron ke liye kaam karti hai

 kai bilderon evam flats maalikon ne bhi ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kar rakhi thi or nyaayalay se anurodh kiya tha ki pratikul aadesh se ve buree tarah prabhavit honge

 The State Government had appealed against this decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court, which was turned down by the Supreme Court

 Since then, several schemes have been launched in his name, such as the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana, the program of livelihood and skill development, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gramjyoti Yojana, the program of electrification in villages, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Rural Skill Scheme and the name of the new office of the Ministry of Tourism Deendayal Upadhyay Tourism Building was kept
 isi tarah loksabhaa tivi ne unke jivan par 13 bhaag vaale ek vrutt chitra kaa prasaaran shuru kar diya he or doordarshan ne unki jeevani par film banane kaa vaada kiya he to soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke prakaashan vibhaag ne unki kritiyon ko phir se prakashit karne or unka prachaar karne kii baat kahi he
 BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe says that soon after the essay competitions and exhibitions in schools and colleges in his name, the announcement of setting up of benches in his name will be announced in some central universities
 ve kehete hai, “pehla agenda yah he ki dinadayal upaadhyaay ke bare main puure desh ko bataaya jaae
 "but who is Deendayal Upadhyay? He was the general secretary of Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 aresas kii rajnatik shakha jansangh kii sthapana 1951 main kii gai thi
 This is also the organizational base of the Jana Sangh BJP
 mukherjee ne ek baar kaha tha, “agar mere paas do dinadayal hote to main bharat kaa rajnatik nakshaa badal detaa
 After Mukherjee's death in 1953, when Upadhyay became the president of the Jana Sangh and started the work of organizing the party on the ground, it turned out to be true as predicted
 1962 main 14 siten jeetne ke baad 1967 ke aam chunaavon main party ne 35 siten jeetin
 The Jana Sangh then supported Ram Manohar Lohia from Farrukhabad, Acharya Kripalani from Amroha and Meenu Masani of the Swatantra Party from Rajkot in an effort to expand their influence across the country and develop a "national democratic alternative" in the face of the Congress
 m gar yah safar lanbaa nahin rahaa or 1968 main upaadhyaay kii aakasmik maut ke saath hi unka utthan or party main badhata unka kad achaanak hi tham gaya
 His body was found lying on the railway tracks near Mughalsarai station
 bijepi ke kuch logon kaa ab bhi maananaa he ki unki hatya kii gai thi
 Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya had by that time given four lectures on "integral Humanism", a philosophy of unity rooted in Hindutva
 darasal, unke ye vyaakhyaan marxvaadi or iske mahaan bhartiya vichaarak em
 N
 roy ke “gahare amanviya yantrikwaad” kaa uttar the
 Roy's philosophy is known as "radical Humanism"
 jansangh or uski viraasat vaali party bijepi ko nishchit rup se upaadhyaay ne hi saanche main dhaala tha
 But the party's grandfather, LK Advani, who considers Upadhyay as his political mentor and who along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee developed the BJP as a powerful party, was not called for the Janmashti Festival held at the Upadhyaya Kenharu Memorial
 upaadhyaay ko mahapurush banane kii is muhim se do sawaal khadey hote hai-bijepi or aresas apane duusare adarsh nayakon ko is tarah kaa sammaan kyon nahin de rahe, jaise ki ke
 B
 headgavar, guru golwalkar or vir saavarkar
 And is Upadhyay the bjp's Nehru? Sahasrabuddhe says, "it would not be wrong to say that Deendayalji's struggle to build the Jana Sangh, not to show any disrespect towards Nehru, was in the struggle to build the Congress
 Is much larger than ” sahasrabuddhe ke mutabik, mahatma gandhi ke shishy ke taur par nehru ko “congress party chaandi kii tashtaree main parosi hui mili thi
 Whereas Upadhyaya had erected the Jana Sangh keeping one brick each
 sahasrabuddhe bhale hi kisi khaas makasad se inkaar karen, lekin yah vaastaviktaa he ki party ne upaadhyaay kaa janmashti mahotsav manaane ke liye bahut soch-samajhakar nehru memorial librari kaa chayan kiya tha, jabaki yah kaarykram bade aaraam se puraane shahar main aresas ke mukhyalay ke paas sthit dinadayal shodh santhaan main yojit kiya ja saktaa tha
 By forcing the resignation of Nehru Memorial director Mahesh Rangarajan on 16 September, the BJP may have wanted to point out that right-wing thinkers have long been kept away from national discourse and must now find a proper place in the nation's construction
 or iske liye rashtriya str par nehru se judi jagah se behatar koun-sa sthaan ho saktaa he?us kaarykram main arun jetali ne is baat kaa ullekh kiya ki nehru ke oonche kad ke baavjood upaadhyaay ek “samaantar vichaar” or “vishisht sanghathan” taiyaar karne main safal rahe the
 But historians say that Upadhyaya's main philosophy is "lectures of Integral Humanism" being nothing more than general ideas, they cannot be considered fundamental ideas in any way
 mastishk, sharir or aatma ko jodgaye ke bare main german romantics main bhi isi tarah kaa vichaar vyakt kiya ja chukaa he
 Russian Slavophiles followed this fiercely in the 19th century
 lekin upaadhyaay ke vichaar mahatvapurn isliye maane gaye kyonki ve apane mul shrotaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Political analyst Pratap Bhanu Mehta says that BJP has not had many great men, that's why efforts are being made to name Upadhyay
 iske saath hi ve yah bhi kehete hai, “lekin shyama prasad mukherjee yaa ke
 M
 munshi jaise apekshaakrit zyada pragatisheel vyaktiyon ko aage badhaane kii bajaae bijepi saamaajik rup se apane rudhivaadee daayre main hi simati hui dikhaai detii he
 "but why Upadhyay's name is ahead of Savarkar, Golwalkar or Hedgewar in bjp's list?" Sahasrabuddhe says about this, “there is no question of distinguishing between one source of inspiration from another source
 ham to apane virodhiyon kaa bhi sammaan karte hai
 Guru Golwalkar was a spiritual thinker, while Deendayalji kept political views before us
 ” lekin apana naam gupt rakhane kii shart par bijepi ke ek sutara ne sweekaar kiya ki “golwalkar ke vichaaron se vivaad paidaa ho saktaa he
 "certainly the way the Congress glorified nehru-gandhi for many decades was bound to react, though Nehru himself never liked such glorification
 lekin lagata he, bijepi apane nayak ke mahimamandan ke jariye aadhunik bharat ke sabase charchit nayak ko peeche karne ke prayaas karne main lagi he

 According to him, due to this problem, natural resources are rapidly decreasing

 Earlier, he had instructed Hindus to have more children
 'ram mandir vahiin banegaa'giriraaj singh ne ram mandir par bhi apni raay rakhi
 He claimed that the temple would be built in 200 percent Ayodhya
 singh ke mutabik tushtikaran kii raajnneeti aisa hone se nahin roak paaegi
 He said that if Ram temple is not built in Ayodhya, then dissatisfaction will develop in the mind of majority population
 singh kaa daawa tha ki hindu or musalmaan ek hi khandaan ke vanshaj hai
 Attacking Owaisi, Giriraj Singh said that the constitution was made by the people of the majority population
 'gaay he mata-tulya'giriraaj singh ke mutabik goraksha ke naam par marpet galat he

 But i am very impressed with it for the first time
 ’ match main paanch wicket chatakaane vaale bolt ne kaha ki ‘match main jeet darj nahin kar paanaa niraashajanak he
 Bolt said that it is important to get a wicket at the beginning of the innings
 agar aap pehle powerple main do yaa teen wicket hasil kar lete ho to isse virdohi team par dabaav daalaa ja saktaa he or match main dabadabaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 But they played well
 ’is kiwi tej gendbaaj ne kaha, ki ‘acchhee tiimon ke khilaaf khelte huegalati kii gunjishkaphi kam hoti he
 It is a big challenge for us to beat the team which is in very good form and make upsets

 input-ians input- IANS The bail plea of journalist Vinod Verma, arrested in the CD scandal, will be heard on Monday
 do din pehle vinod verma ke vakeelon ne court main jamaanat yachika lagaai thi, lekin police kii ore se cese diary pesh nahin kii gai, natijatan sunwaayee tal gai
 The court on Monday directed to present the police diary
 patrkaar vinod verma ko chhattisgarh police ne 27 oktober ko gajiabad se giraftaar kiya tha
 The court there handed him over to the Chhattisgarh police on a three-day police remand
 iske baad raipur kii jila court ne police remand kii avadhi teen din ke liye or badha di
 On October 31, he was jailed for 13 days on judicial remand
 verma kii ore se pesh jamaanat aavedan main kaha gaya he ki unke paas se naa to koi sidi baraamad hui he or naa hi koi aapattijanak vastu mili he
 The Chhattisgarh police have implicated him in false charges
 is aavedan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki unke paas se ek pe nadrive or ek laptop hi mila he
 On the other hand, in order to make the case serious in the CD scandal, the police is trying hard
 court main patrkaar vinod verma ke khilaaf daayar prakaran kamjor naa pad jaae iske liye police ne tabadatod chaape jari rakhe hai
 Police inquiries are on with many traders from Bhilai and Durg and activists associated with the Congress
 bataa den ki rajya sarkaar ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di he
 On the other hand, the police are taking extreme action and taking many people into custody and accusing them
 ye wo log hai jinka congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel or patrkaar vinod verma se kareebi naata rahaa he
 Police are questioning a dozen people who are in constant contact on Vinod Verma's mobile
 durg ke meyar devendra yadav samet kuch kaarobaariyon se bhi is maamle main poochtacha kii gai he
 Till now the Chhattisgarh police has not been able to tell how Vinod Verma is involved in the blackmailing and conspiracy in the Dirty CD scandal
 yah tathy abhi tak police sthapit nahin kar pai he
 Not only this, who made this CD and when it has not been clear
 sidi banane kaa aakhir makasad kya tha, ise lekar bhi police kii maathapai jari he
 Police actions, including the Congress, are seen as completely suspicious
 aanan fanan main sarkari vimaan se police kaa dilli janaa, phir ratorat patrkaar vinod verma ko daboch lenaa
 Within a few hours of the CD going viral, Minister Rajesh Munat's claim that the CD is fake is no less than a conspiracy
 raipur ke police adheekshaksanjeev shukla or aiji pradeep gupta yah kah chuke hai ki raipur ke pandari thane main darj exiaar main naa to patrkaar vinod verma kaa naam he or naa hi yah kaha gaya he ki darty sidi mantri rajesh munat kii he
 Nor have both officers and police staff seen the pornographic CD
 aise main kaise police kii team vishesh vimaan se dilli pahunch gai
 Both officers could not answer many important questions
 aamtaur par exiaar darj hone ke kai dinon baad bhi rajya kii police aropiyon kii sud tak nahin leti
 In such a situation, Raipur police is also under investigation
 aakhir sibiai kya karegi is baat ko lekar bhi bhram kii sthiti he
 Actually, a SIT is doing the entire investigation of the crime
 aise main sarkaar ne sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kyonki yah sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Usually, after the matter is recommended to the CBI, the transparency of the concerned state police breaks its investigation by bringing it to a particular fact, but this is not happening in Chhattisgarh
 congress pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel se bhi ab tak kyon poochhataanch nahin hui, jabaki wo shahar main he or unke khilaaf is darty sidi cond kii sidi vitarit karne kaa aarope laga kar raipur ke civil line thane main iti act ke tahat prakaran darj kiya gaya he
 There are many facts which seem to indicate that the police proceedings are being out of the box
 aise main sibiai aakhir kya jaanch karegi, yah dekhnaa mahatvapurn hoga
 The Chhattisgarh Police is collecting all the facts of the CD scandal with special interest
 mul shikayatakarta prakaash bajaj media se najar bachaate chahalkadami kar rahe hai
 From the police to the bjp-influenced government staff and its officials, by issuing another CD, it is propagating that the real CD is this and that the minister's CD is fake
 iskaa makasad kya he
 It is clear from the special interest of the Chhattisgarh Police that there is no attempt to divert even the CBI investigation
 philhal patrkaar vinod verma kii jamaanat yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan chhattisgarh police kya tathy rakhegi, is par sabhi kii nigahen lagi hui hai

 Children forget everything while playing
 khilne ke dauraan na to unhen garmi lagati he or na hi thakaan hoti he lekin suraj kii garmi or taap unke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 On one hand there is weakness due to heat, on the other hand, the risk of getting many diseases also increases
 ab bachche hai to ham unhen khilne-kudane se roak nahin sakate par aap chahen to in upayon ko apanaakar aap apane bacchon ko surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Let's know how to save children from the heat of summer
 
 
 -garmi ke mausam main bacchon kii pachan shakti kamjor ho jaati he
 During this period, children are more susceptible to diarrhea, heat stroke, stomach irritation, vomiting, jaundice, typhoid
 isliye bacchon ke khanpan kaa puraa dhyaan rakhen or unhen halkaa, paushtik aahaar den
 Do it -khilne ke dauraan bachche sabakuch bhul jate hai ormausam kaa dhyaan die bina hi khelte rahete hai
 In such a situation, keep in mind that the child should not play during strong sunlight or sun
 shaam hone par hi bachche ko baahar jane den
 During the day, ask him to play indoor games
 - garmiyon main shaam ke vakt machhar or keede kaaphi sakriy ho jate hai
 In such a situation, when the child is going to play, send him outside only by applying cream that provides protection from insects and mosquitoes
 -koshish karen ki baccha baahar kii koi cheez na khaae
 To prevent de-hydration, give children as much liquid as possible
 unhen ghar main hi bana zeus, nibu pani yaa phir nariyal pani pine ko den
 Buttermilk, fresh fruit juice, milk shake can also be given to the child
 iske alaava khiraa, kakadi or tarbooz bhi khaane ko de sakate hai
 There will be no shortage of water in the child's body due to their consumption
 - garmiyon ke dinon main bacchon ko din main do baar nahaane kii aadat dalawaaen
 Wear baby clothes only and change clothes daily
 kahin bhi baahar se aane par uske haath pair acchhee tarah se sabun se saaf karavaaen
 Doing so will reduce the risk of infection
 -mausam kaa dhyaan rakhte hue sard-garm kaa khyaal rakhen jaise, agar bachche dhoop main khelkar waapas aaen to cooler ke saamne na baithne den or turant hi thanda pani bhi na den
 - The risk of conjunctivitis in the summer season is also increased
 isliye thode-thode antaraal ke baad bacchon kii ankhen thande pani se dhulawaate rahen
 This will not cause dryness in the eyes of children
 - bacchon ko garmiyon main aksar ghamauriyon or sanbern kii samasya ho jaati he
 To protect them, bathe children with glycerin soap twice a day with cold water and use prickly pesticide powder
 mashhoor naatakkaar or cinema, televijan kii duniya ke patakatha lekhak vijay tendulkar kii aaj jayanti he
 In the world of literature, Vijay Tendulkar's pen stops speaking of big pen-makers

 seshanh gats he glorispikarh farhaan akhtarindia today mind rox summit 2013ke aakhri seshan kii moderator baniin india today group kii sinerjee offisar kali puri
 The guests of this session are Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Screen Play, Best Lyrics Award, Farhan Akhtar
 Mind rocks: dallalon ko vidhansabha nahin jane duungaa: kejarivankhtar aayaa or chaa gaya
 
 
 As soon as Farhan Akhtar came on stage, a bill in my laundry started ringing and Farhan started to whir
 phir vah khud bhi mike par yah gaanaa gunagunaane lage
 When the noise stopped for a few seconds, i said, i wish, the manager of my band would see this and be happy
 Mind rocks: summit kaa aagaaj, 'antariksh' ne jamaaya rangakali pehla sawaal poochhate hi thithak gayi
 The noise was increasing like the sea
 farhaan bole, aisa lag rahaa he ki ek tub main baitha hum or dhudum dhudum bulbule aakar lag rahe hai
 Then Farhan had to speak
 mere paas kehane ko bhi bahut kuch he
 You will keep watching me like this
 yahaan kii energy shandaar he
 i will come to Mind Rocks every year
 suniye or kya kaha farhaan ne kali ke sawaalon par
 
 
 Question: Do you care about the 100 crore club? Answer: My answer would be that yes, i am happy that the films are so liked, earning
 masalan, bhaag milkha bhaag, jisamen rakesh, prasoon, sonam, sabaki mehnat thi
 People praised him
 magar 100 karod kaa sochakar kaam nahin chal saktaa, ki chalo ek film banaate hai, jo itnaa kamayegi
 i want people to remember me both as an actor and a director
 jab main diarect karata hum, to puri tarah se usee main dub jaataa hum
 When i act, i am completely spent
 donon main hi sahaj hum
 Only the public can decide in whom i can do better
 main to itnaa hi kahuunga ki main apni taraf se koi kasar nahin chodta
 For example, the band had to understand the mechanism for Rock On
 bhaag milkha bhaag ke liye physical training kerani padi
 i once said that every person has a milkha
 har shaks asambhav ko hasil kar saktaa he
 The need is to identify that possibility and then give everything to him
 bich raste main chhod dena aasaan he
 But it is difficult to hold on to the last and make the thought possible
 magar aap tike rahen aakhri tak, to aap zyada majboot, zyada budhimaan hokar ubharenge
 Mind rocks: Pace wanted to become a footballer, became a tennis player: about the experience of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag
 javabamere liye is film ko karnaa ek nai lakeer khinchne kii tarah tha
 Everyone was asking questions
 farhaan kaise karegaa
 How will the role of an athlete become a Sardar
 
 
 ye aapke liye ek chunauti gadhane kaa kaam karata he
 It is up to you, you take it in negative sense or take it as a chance, like a challenge
 kisi bhi cheez ko karne laayak hai aap, ye use mehnat se hasil karke hi sabit kiya ja saktaa he
 Be it Bhaag Milkha Bhaag or the second peak of cinema, this philosophy has come in his journey
 mahatvakanksha ye nahin rahi ki kisi or se behatar hona he yaa kisi ko pachhaadna he
 The objective is to do your best
 Mind rocks: maa kii farmaaish par banaaya daaru songah hard kaurabahan joya kii farhaan karte hai bahut izzat
 
 
 There was a time when there was competition in the industry
 joya meri bahan, uskaa mujh par bahut asar rahaa
 i used to lie a lot in childhood
 main ye yakeen karnaa chahta tha ki main jhooth nahin bolta, story gadhata hum
 Zoya was the only one who knew
 kuch gadabad karata tha, to wo pakad leti thi
 Used to come near and say go and tell the mother about it
 isiilie main uski bahut-bahut izzat karata hum
 That is why even today i am lost, confused, i go to him only
 or haa, vah bilashak bahut pratibhashali riter or diarector bhi he
 Mind rocks: Till today we have not seen women rioting: Kiran Bediswal: What is that hunger that excites you even after you have achieved all this? Answer: Farhan said that you decide in a moment and then according to that decision ahead Let's go the way
 jab milkha vaali film mili, to laga ki ye mujhe mere confort jone se baahar nikaalati thi
 And it was very important to move forward
 Mind rocks: risk lene se ghabaraae nahin yuvah lauren gotlebaswalabhag milkha bhaag kii mushkil training ke dauraan kabhi kathinaayee lagi ho, laga ho ki ab or nahin kar saktaa?javabzhamammam yangsters ko dhyaan main rakhkar ye sawaal poocha gaya he
 But i am not right to answer this

 In this task, the winning team has to protect their flag, which is placed in the garden area, while the other team has to remove it and place their flag there

 Things get worse when one team tries to remove the flag with all its might, and the other saves it

 For the party's 21st General Conference, also known as the Party Congress, 800 delegates of the CPM are gathering in Visakhapatnam from across the country
 is baar kaa sammelan isliye mahatvapurn he ki kareeb 10 saal tak sipiem ke mahasachiv ke pad par rahane ke baad prakaash karaat is pad se ritair ho rahe hai
 The name of CPM MP and Sitaram Yechury is leading the way as his successor
 haalanki prakaash karaat ne enditivi india se baatcheet nen kaha, hamaari party main central cameti hi mahasachiv kaa chunaav karti he
 In our party, it cannot happen that i declare the name of my successor
 agle mahasachiv kaa pataa aapako vishakhapattanam main hamaari congress ke aakhri din hi pataa chalegaa
 Karat's statement and talking to sources in the party reveal that the last round of churning for the post of general secretary will take place in the 'party Congress', but in the current situation the chances of Yechury becoming the general secretary are the highest
 party mahasammelan main sabase badi ikai he ,‘party congress'
 The 'party Congress' elects the Central Committee, which is the deciding body of about 75 to 80 members
 central cameti kii tulana bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini yaa congress kii seedblusi se kii ja sakati he
 Senior leader of CPM and important Central Committee member of the party, Nilotpal Basu, says that in our party there is not much importance of who is the general secretary, because every major decision and the party's line is decided by the central committee
 mahasachiv kaa kaam ise lagu karana or ek samanvay bithaana he
 'currently, three big and senior leaders of the Politburo are Prakash Karat, SR Pillai and Sitaram Yechury
 ye teenon hi 1992 main chennai main hui ‘party congress’main paulitte beuro ke liye chune gaye

 That is why in this 'party Congress' the CPM will discuss the political proposal as well as the party's strategy, for which a review report is being kept in this 'party Congress'
 pichley saal seetaram yechuri or prakaash karaat ke bich party kii line ko lagu karne main hui galatiyon ko lekar matbhed ubhare the
 Read: - Conflicts in CPM, differences emerged in karat-yechury In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, CPM had 44 mps and was the third largest party in the Lok Sabha
 aaj uske paas keval 9 saansad hai
 The party has lost power in Bengal and Kerala and only Tripura has survived its government
 agle saal bengal or kerala donon hi jagah party ko chunaav kaa saamana karnaa he
 In both states, the CPM faces a tough challenge
 aise main party main kai log maanate hai ki seetaram yechuri ko aglaa mahasachiv bananaa thik rahegaa
 But sources also say that a camp can also extend the name of Sill Pillai at the last moment, who are second after Karat in order of preference

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was seen pleading with the Congress on Wednesday that BJP can be defeated if the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress join hands
 ye alag baat he ki unki vinati dilli ke liye nahin balki haryana ke liye thi lekin iske myne gambhir hai
 Even those who understand politics know that Arvind Kejriwal is not seen in the mode of pleading
 baavjood iske ve congress ko apane paale main milaane main lage hai, to iske napha-nuksaan kii bhi unhen samaj hogi hi
 People are also surprised because recently, Delhi Congress President Sheila Dixit has bluntly said that there will be no alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir aisi kya majaburi he jo congress se gathjod ke liye aam aadmi party ne apane saare ghode khol die hai?congress se lagi asajaan len ki dilli ke alaava desh kaa aisa koi rajya nahin he jahaan aam aadmi party dam thok kar kah de ki hamaara vahaan thos janaadhar he
 This party tried its best in many states but its political experiment has fallen on its face
 udhaaharan ke taur par punjab or goa ko dekh len
 In both places, the Aam Aadmi Party went in full preparedness but had to return back to Goa
 haalanki, punjab loksabhaa chunaav main party ne acha pradarshan kiya lekin clin sweep ke sapane uske dhare rah gaye
 Explain that Punjab has 13 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ko 4, congress ko 3, akali dal ko 4 or bijepi ko 1 seat par jeet mili thi
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which has done well in the Punjab Lok Sabha, fell behind in the assembly elections
 is pichhadane ko vah gathbandhan se bharpai karnaa chaahati he taaki milakar bijepi ko haraaya ja sake
 The journey of Delhi via Haryana is now about Haryana
 aam aadmi party kaa haryana main majboot aadhaar nahin he or party yahaan ghusane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) was formed in December after a split in the Indian National Lok Dal
 abhi haal main jejepi ne jind vidhansabha seat par hue upachunaav main acha pradarshan kiya tha
 In this by-election, the Aam Aadmi Party supported the JJP candidate but BJP candidate Krishna Lal Middha won by 12248 votes
 jejepi ke digvijay singh chautaala duusare number par rahe
 That is BJP number one, JJP number two and Congress number three
 is lihaaj se bhi aam aadmi party soch rahi he ki haryana main agar congress or jejepi se gathbandhan ho jaae to bijepi ko aasaani se maat di ja sakati he
 But the important question in front of Arvind Kejriwal's party is how to answer to the BJP which won 7 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, while the INLD had to settle for 2 and Congress 1
 aam aadmi party is sawaal kaa jawaab congress ke saath gathbandhan main dhund rahi he
 It is not the case with Sheila, Tanwar that Arvind Kejriwal suddenly agreed to join hands with Congress for an alliance in Haryana on Wednesday
 jejepi or aam aadmi party main gathbandhan kii charchaaen vahaan pichley kaaphi din se chal rahi hai lekin gathbandhan kisi anjaam tak nahin pahunch paaya he
 Kejriwal is well aware that if there is talk of a coalition in Haryana, the possibility of an alliance in Delhi will not be far away, but the real problem is that today the Congress command in Delhi is in the hands of Sheila Dixit, then Ashok Tanwar is the president in Haryana
 in donon netaaon se arvind kejariwal aakhir baat karen to kaise? aise main kejariwal sidhe taur par rahul gandhi ko sambodhit kar rahe hai or gathbandhan kii aas jagaa rahe hai
 Now that the Congress has come to an answer, what to say that the alliance prospects in both the parties have waned? It would be a mistake to believe that there is some kind of mutual understanding between Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, when both seem to be avoiding each other
 haal main kejariwal se ek sawaal poocha gaya ki kya aam aadmi party gathbandhan kii baatcheet se aage bad chuki he? is par kejariwal kaa kaaphi sadha jawaab tha ki "bina gathbandhan ke aam aadmi ke saansad jeet rahe hai, philhal aam aadmi party ke paas congress se koi jaankaree nahi he"
 There was no talk against the Congress in his talks
 isse saaf he ki kejariwal kahin na kahin gathbandhan kii majaburi se bandhe hai ki ho saktaa he kal ko koi acchhee khabar aa jaae

 Former captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who led India to victory in the three matches of the Cricket World Cup against Pakistan, feels that Pakistan will not be a major threat to the defending team in the much-anticipated match between the two arch-rivals in the World Cup
 ajaharuddin ne kaha, bharat-pakistan kaa muqabla hameshaa hi bada hota he
 We have not lost to Pakistan in the World Cup and when we get down for the match, it will be in everyone's mind
 mujhe lagata he ki bhartiya team acchhee he or agar vah acha khele, to mujhe nahin lagata ki pakistan se koi bada khatra hoga
 He, however, said that after the match against Pakistan in Adelaide on 15 February, the road will not be easy, as the team which has failed to perform well in Australia so far, will have to maintain more consistency to retain the title
 purv captain ne kaha, antim chaar main jagah banane ke liye raah aasaan nahin hogi
 They have to play better continuously
 mujhe lagata he ki unhen zyada match jeetne honge, taaki aatmavishvaas kaa str ooncha rahe
 If they started losing, it would be very difficult to make a comeback
 ajaharuddin ne kaha, unke paas acchhee team he, pratibha he, lekin ant main yah myne rakhata he ki team feet kitni he or vanade maichon ke dauraan apane ko alag-alag sthitiyon ke anuroop kaise dhalati he
 The performance of the current Indian team, which recently lost a four-match Test series to Australia and failed to reach the final of the tri-series, is reminiscent of the performance of the team that visited Australia in 1992, when Azharuddin led the Indian team there
 After the poor performance, they could not make it to the semi-finals of the World Cup
 lekin ajaharuddin ko lagata he ki ek baar jab board daure ke liye sahamat ho jaataa he, tab koi bahaanaa nahin hona chahie
 He said, the board had approved the tour and the program, so we cannot complain
 ham taiyaar the or hamen pataa tha ki hamen test match khilne hai or phir vishwa cap se pehle trikoniya vanade siries main khelnaa he
 The board agreed to it and accordingly they (players) should have taken care of their fitness
 ajaharuddin ne kaha, chotil hone kaa dar hameshaa rahata he, kyonki yah ek kathin khel he, lekin saath hi aapako iskaa dhyaan rakhana chahie, kyonki aapako daure kaa pataa he
 Therefore you cannot make excuses like this
 unhone kaha, lekin hamen ek feet team chahie, mujhe lagata he ki chot se pareshaan khilaadiyon ko team main rakhaa gaya he or yah sahi nahin he
 This puts players in dilemma replacing those players and this is not true for team management, as they are not sure about the fitness of these players

 com / u0peiawlvs congress ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi jald hi party ke adhyaksh banane ja rahe hai
 After independence, the Congress has had 16 presidents so far and Rahul Gandhi is going to be the 19th president of the party
 congress main sonia gandhi ne jitne saal party kii adhyakshata kii he utane hi saal jawahar laal nehru, indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi teenon ne milakar adhyaksh pad sambhala he
 For 38 years, Gandhi has been the president of the Gandhi family in the Congress party for 19 years, while Nehru has been president for 4 years, Indira for 8 years and Rajiv Gandhi for 7 years
 saaf he ki 70 saal kii aazaadee main 38 saal tak gandhi parivaar ke log hi party adhyaksh rahe hai
 In the remaining 32 years, from JB Kripalani, p Sitaramaiya, Purshottam Das Tandon to Kamaraj, Jagjivanram and PV Narasimha Rao, Sitaram Kesari also took over as president
 ateet ke aasare bhavishya kii raahazadee se pehle ke 61 baras yani 1985 se 1946 tak congress main 50 adhyaksh bane or adhyaksh hone kii is pherahist main gokhale se lekar mahatma gandhi, abdul kalam aaazaad or sardaar patel se lekar madanamohan malviya, lala lajpat raay, dada bhai nauroji or subhash chandra bose se lekar rajendra prasad tak adhyaksh rahe
 So Rahul Gandhi, apart from his family, can take command of the party by learning from the participants in the freedom struggle
 sirf 4 mahilayen hi raheen adhyakshaparty main adhyaksh pad sirf chaar mahilaon ne hi sambhala
 These include Annie Bensat, Sarojini Naidu, Indira Gandhi and Sonia
 adhyakshon kii is perhist main sonia or indira se pehle jo do mahilaye congress adhyaksha raheen usamen 1917 main ani bensot to 1925 main sarojini naidu kaa naam he
 This history of the Congress presidents shows that the Congress was once the court of the country
 lekin maujuuda vakt congress apane hone ke ehsaas main sabase kamjor he or 19 baras baad jab sonia gandhi se rahul ke haath main congress kii kaman aayegi to rahul gandhi kesamne sawaal teen honge
 Heritage, Renaissance and Conflict
 in teen kasautiyon par khara utarkar hi rahul congress ko maujuuda vakt main ubaar paaenge
 The challenge to deal with the Modi wave, the party will have to be very tough from where it is now, because the Modi wave is such that the dream of Congress-free India has reached the heart of the BJP
 congress ko apane kader main nae jaagran kii bhi zarurat hogi, kyonki haal ke dinon main vipaksh kii bhoomika simatati ja rahi he or use ladaai na sirf sansad tak balki sadakon par utar ke kerani hogi
 In the last few days, there is also that enthusiasm in Rahul Gandhi, which seems that he is ready to take the lead
 lekin pad ke baad unke saamne party, kader or janata teenon ko saath lekar chalane kii chunauti bhi hogi

 netherlands ke da hegg sthit international court of justise (isije) ne kulbhushan jadhav par faisla sunaaya he
 In a major setback to Pakistan, the ICJ has banned the hanging of Kulbhushan Jadhav and asked him to reconsider
 iske saath hi isije ne ye bhi faisla sunaaya he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko counciller acces kii ijaajat milegi
 16 judges were hearing the case, out of which 15 ruled in favor of India
 ab jo sabase bada sawaal he ki agar pakistan ne isije kaa faisla nahin maanata he to kya hoga
 Article 94 of the United Nations Charter states that all members of the United Nations must comply with ICJ decisions in cases in which they are parties
 bharat or pakistan ne is par hastakshar kiye hai
 Also read: What would happen to Pakistan if icj's verdict on Kulbhushan was not given? Pakistan had not given Jadhav counselor access in violation of the Vienna Convention
 vienna canavension main ek vaikalpik protocol he, jiske baad vivaad ke samay is sandhi ko sin karne vaale ise maanane ke liye baadhya hote hai
 Both Pakistan and India are parties in this
 isije kii ore se die jane vaale aadesh badhyakaari hote hai
 But now there is a difference between principles and reality
 saal 2004 main isije ne mexico ke 51 nagarikon ko lekar faisla sunaaya tha
 At that time, the US had convicted all 51 of these citizens in a court trial
 america ke supreme court ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya tha or kaha ki faisla rashtriya kanoonon ko kinare nahin kar saktaa he
 In 2005, the US pulled itself out of this alternative protocol
 isije ke faisle badhyakaari jarur hote hai lekin ve deshon ko faisla maanane ke liye majaboor nahin kar saktaa he
 If Pakistan does not accept the decision of ICJ, then the role of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will become important
 ye bhi padhein-kulbhushan jadhav par ICJ ke faisle ne paak ko ek-do nahin, die puure teen attackeuanessi pakistan ko isije kaa faisla maanane ke liye majaboor kar sakati he
 But the screw here is China
 yahaan par zyaadaatar ummid he ki china apane dost pakistan ke saath jayega
 The second is also that the UNSC refuses to interfere in it
 phir is maamle main koi rasta nahin rahegaa
 Third, the Security Council measure can be adopted only when international peace and security is at stake

 Tees Maar Khan - Though Housefull 4 is not Akshay Kumar's first film to do good business despite poor reviews
 isse pehle bhi akshay kumaar kii filmon ke saath aisa kai baar ho chukaa he
 You will remember Akshay Kumar's film Tees Maar Khan, released on 24 December 2010
 film kaa bajet mahaj 28 karod rupee tha lekin isane box offis par takreen 60 karod rupee kaa bijness kiya tha
 Sing is Bling - Apart from this, the film was released in the year 2015, when it comes to Prabhu Deva-directed film Sing Is Bling
 ye film bhi critics se acha rivyuu paane main naakaam rahi thi
 The mouth publicity that this film received was also not good
 lekin baavjood iske 41 karod rupee ke bajet se bani is film ne takreeban 116 karod rupee kaa bijness kiya tha
 Rowdy rathore-akshay Kumar's film was a Hindi remake of a South Indian film
 45 karod rupee ke bajet main bani ye film saal 2012 main relies hui thi
 The film did a business of around 133 crores at the box office at that time

 In the politics of Haryana, the trio of Bansi lal-devi lal-bhajan Lal's shadow over the political legacy of Lal's political legacy will fight the heirs of the three Lal families in the election elections
 The politics of Haryana has been confined around Bansi Lal, Devi Lal and Bhajan Lal for almost four decades
 haryana ke ye teenon 'laal' pradesh kii satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hone ke saath-saath rashtriya raajnneeti ke bhi bade chehre rahe hai
 But, in the current political climate of Haryana, the 'lalas' of Bansi Lal, Devi Lal and Bhajan Lal are being forced to preserve their political existence
 purv up pradhanmantri devilal, purv mukhyamantri bansilaal or bhajanlaal ke naam se haryana kii pahchaan hoti rahi he
 Although the three lalas considered to be Chanakya of Haryana politics are no longer in the world, but their heirs are advancing the politics of their respective families
 inamen in laalon ke bete hi nahin balki betiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Devi Lal's legacy was in two factions, in the politics of Bantihariana, Tau Chaudhary Devi Lal spoke a tremendous weight
 devilal kii party ne 1987 ke haryana vidhansabha chunaav main 90 main se 85 siten jitkar tahalaka machaa diya tha
 Devilal was the CM of Haryana twice
 haryana ke saath-saath punjab main vidhayak rahe devilal do alag-alag sarkaron main desh ke dipti pradhanmantri bhi bane
 His political legacy was handled by son Om Prakash Chautala and four times he was the CM of Haryana

 vah teen baar vidhayak chuni gai
 In order to carry on Bansi Lal's political legacy, Kiran Chaudhary introduced her daughter Shruti Chaudhary in 2009 and she came to Parliament after electing from Bhiwani
 iske baad 2014 or 2019 main ladi, lekin vah jeet nahin sakin
 In such a situation, the challenge for the Bansi Lal family is no less

 With the defeat of the West Indies, Team India has confirmed its place in the quarter-finals
 dhoni ke dhurandhar lagaataar duusari baar worldcup khitaab jeetne se ab mahaj teen kadam dur hai
 The biggest reason for this change in Team India is the great performance of the team's fast bowlers
 mohammad shami, umesh yadav or mohit sharma kii tikdi is worldcup ke dauraan sabase khatarnaak or maarak tikdi ban kar ubhari he
 Mohammed Shami has bowled 25 overs in 3 matches, taking 9 wickets for just 100 runs
 mohit sharma ne 4 maichon main 30 overon kii gendbaaji main 117 ran dekar 6 wicket jatke hai
 At the same time, Umesh Yadav scored 32 from 4 matches
 3 overon kii gendbaazi main 141 ran dekar 6 wicket liye hai
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said after the match to the West Indies, "the bowlers have done brilliantly, Umesh bowls fast, Shami has taken responsibility with the new ball, Mohit is consistently doing well in the middle over, fast bowler in one unit
 Are doing as well
 " The wonder of these bowlers is that no team has been able to bat a full 50 overs against India so far
 itnaa hi nahin koi team bharat ke khilaaf 225 ran bhi nahin bana saki he
 Let us know that in the first match, Pakistan were all out in 47 overs, for 224 runs
 duusare match main hashim amala or abi divilliars jaise ballebaazon kii team 41wein over main 177 ran par simat gai thi
 In the third match, the UAE was reduced to 102 runs in the 31st over
 jabaki chauthe match main westeindies kii team 45wein over main 182 ran par simat gai
 In the tournament, Indian fast bowlers have shown amazing performance on Australian soil
 baaki ke do maichon main unhen newzealand main kahin zyada anukool halaat milenge
 If Team India's fast bowlers continue to work at this pace, then Team India will create history this time too

 iske alaava suresh raina, viraat kohli or rohit sharma ko bhi jagah mil sakati he
 The current ODI series in South Africa was seen as an opportunity to prove its usefulness to potential players, but skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni put an end to the speculation by saying that only this performance would not be the basis of selection
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘sirf ek shrinkhalaa kaa pradarshan myne nahin rakhata
 Only players playing well for the last year and a half will get a place
 ’gendbaaji main bharat ke paas itnaa pool hi nahin he ki chayan kii duvidha paidaa ho

 There may be chaos in the country regarding demonetisation, but in Chhattisgarh, the tribals of Bastar are enjoying themselves
 wo haat bazaaron main har wo saamaan kharid rahe he jinaki unhen rojaanaa aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Neither they have 500 and one thousand notes nor black money
 jiske chalate notebandi kaa asar in adivaasiyon par nahin hua he
 The hot markets of Bastar seem to be ineffective by demonetisation, usually small or big haat markets in other districts of Chhattisgarh have had a partial effect from demonetisation
 lekin bastar ke bazaaron main pehle kii tarah raunak barkaraar he
 Sulfi is called Maanghay Haat markets are identified as Sulfi, it is called indigenous beer of tribals
 ped paudhon se nikalne vaale is peya padaarth kii bazaar main pehle kii tarah maang bani hui he
 The same is true of vegetables, there is no problem of open money in the market, nor of big notes
 adivaasiyon ke is bazaar main aaj bhi sau kaa note sabase bada mana jaataa he, vyapaaree ise haathon haath le rahe he
 Not seeing the routine affected, these Haat market does not seem to have affected the daily routine of the tribals in the note ban
 aadhuniktaa ke is daur main ye adivasee aaj bhi paramparaagat chizon ko hi mahatv dete he
 So the traders participating in the hot markets do not forget to bring their goods
 in bazaaron main mahilaon kii shringaar saamagree se lekar purushon ke dainik upyog main aane vaali har vasteen shumaar hoti he
 Earlier these tribals used to give chironji, cashew nuts and many precious herbs to the merchants in exchange for salt and chilli
 kyonki inke haathon main nagdi nahin hua karti thi
 But in the current era, the income of the tribals is also large, so there is a trend of 100,50 such notes in all the hot markets of Bastar
 bastar ke haat bazaaron par naksaliyon kii bhi nigahen lagi rahati he
 Since these days, the Naxalites are setting up to buy 500 and 1000 notes that they have
 lihaaja saadi vardi main police ke javaanon kii tainaati in haat bazaaron main he
 They are keeping an eye on mutual transactions ranging from buyers to traders
 police ko andeshaa he ki zyada se zyada 500 or 1000 ke noton ko khapaane ke liye naksali kahin adivaasiyon ke paas maujuud 50 or 100 ke noton ko hi chin len
