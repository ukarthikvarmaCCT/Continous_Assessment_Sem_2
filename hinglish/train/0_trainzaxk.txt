 He filed a petition in the Supreme Court in February 2016
 yah desh main pehali muslim mahila thi jisane sadiyon se chali aa rahi ekbargi teen talaak kahkar fouran talaak dene kii pratha kii vaidhata ko chunauti di thi
 The unprecedented decision on 22 August 2017
 pradhan nyaayadhish kii adaalat main gahari shanti chai hui thi, jo supreme court ke mahaan faislon kii parampara ke anuroop thi
 But there was a fair outside the court
 puraa lon rang-birangi chhatriyon se dhak gaya tha, tivi channelon ke photographeron ne apane camere adaalat ke oonche-oonche stambhon par laga rakhe the, reporter adhikariyon se ek paas ke liye reria rahe the, yuva vakil badi teji se laal rang ke makhmali paradon ko hataakar andar-baahar aa-ja rahe the
 Around 10 in the morning
 30 baje kolahal shuru ho gaya
 By midday, the crowd boomed with joy and the slogans of "boy, Boy, Triple Divorce" echoed with the fingers making the letter "V" (victory) in English
 teen talaak kaa mudda jitna charchit hua he, utana haal ke varshon main shaayad hi koi doosraa mudda charchit hua ho
 The issue has been in national prominence since October 2015 when the Supreme Court accepted the PIL and petitions of Muslim women seeking a stay on triple talaq
 is mukademe ke centre main un muslim mahilaon kii takalifon se bhari nijee jindagi thi, jo parampara or aadhuniktaa, majahab or kanoon ke bich funs kar rah gai thi
 The drama of the case was going on in the general public as well: there was a political contest as to who takes the credit for "freedom" for Muslim women
 kya modi sarkaar, jisane teen talaak ke khilaaf kadaa rukh apanaaya, yaa ol india muslim personal lau board (eiempielbi) jo puure bharat main sunni musalamaanon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The board said that personal law does not have the authority to interfere with the judiciary
 adaalat ke bheetar jo drama hua, vah iskaa clymex tha
 There five judges wrote a new chapter in the history of the country by ending three divorces by a small margin of three
 teen talaak kaa mukadmaa aadhunik loktantric samaaj main sanvaidhanik nyaay kaa ek adarsh rup he
 According to Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, it is respect for human rights, rule of law for public interest and a particular political culture
 ve kehete hai ki beti bachaao, beti padhaao kaarykram se lekar sukanya samruddhi yojana tak ''langik nyaay" dilaanaa narendra modi sarkaar kaa mukhya lakshya rahaa he
 The promise that was fulfilled '' Today, i feel free
 " yah kehete hue shaayara ke chehre par muskaan or ankhon main chamak dikhaai de rahi thi
 He said, "I support and welcome the decision
 yah muslim auraton ke liye ek aitihaasik din he
 "as the verdict was being read in court, the calm and Sakuchai Shaira, wearing a blue salwar-kameez, looked silently to see how the rule of law worked
 desh kii aazaadee ke 70wein varsh main agar sachmuch kisi ne kismat ke saath vaade ko nibhaate hue dekha he to vah shaayara he, bharat kii pehali mahila jisane teen talaak kii sanvaidhanik vaidhata ko chunauti di—vah ek baithki main teen baar talaak kehane kii pratha jo muslim mardon ko (khaskar sunni sampradaay ke) fouran ekatarfa or waapas na liya ja sakane vaala talaak dene kaa adhikaar detii he
 This "arbitrary" right for centuries was a combination of primitive laws that had been ruling over family, marriage, divorce and inheritance in the name of religion and tradition
 shaayara kii jindagi kii kahani aam mahilaon kii daraavnee kahani he
 Take the case of Ishrat Jahan
 kareeb 40 saal kii ishrat pashchim bengal ke ek gaanv main apane chaar bacchon ke paalan-poshan main vyast rahati thi ki ek din kadhai kaa kaam karne vaale uske pati ne dubai se phone karke 15 saal puraani shaadi ko tod diya
 Or take the case of 29-year-old Afreen Rahman
 madhya pradesh ke uske pati saiyad ashahar ali varsi ne sirf 11 maheene kii shaadi ke baad hi speed post se teen talaak bhej diya
 In March 2015, Zakia Soman and Nur Jahan Niaz, co-founders of the Indian Muslim Women's Movement (BMMA), an organization fighting for the rights of Muslim women in the country, conducted a survey on 5,000 Muslim women under the name "seeking Justice Within Family"
 unhone paaya ki talakshuda 59 pratishat mahilaayein teen talaak kii vyavastha se peedit thim or 92 pratishat mahilaayein is par pratibandh lagane ke paksh main thim
 He had collected more than 50,000 signatures and sent it to the Prime Minister
 shabdon kii shaktiyah vah kshan he jise shabdon kii takat se napa ja saktaa he
 This issue is being fiercely discussed in political circles
 kuch netaa to is shabd par pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi zyada vajan daal rahe hai
 Since October 2016, the Prime Minister has consistently used words such as "protect" and "protect" Muslim sisters from the injustice of triple talaq in his speeches: During the election campaign in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP national in Bhubaneswar On the occasion of his address to the executive, and in the Independence Day speech this year
 22 agast ko unhone is faisle ko ''aitihaasik" bataaya
 This was enough to give credit to the Prime Minister for this legal battle of triple talaq on social media
 ek pratikriya ko dekhen, ''pradhanmantri modi kii ore se lagaataar spasht or drudh rukh akhriyaar karne ke baad teen talaak kii kupratha ko supreme court ne asanvaidhanik bataa diya he
 "union Finance, Defense and Corporate Affairs Minister Arun Jaitley said the same after the verdict
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne ise muslim mahilaon ke adhikaron kii jeet bataaya
 According to rss's Indresh Kumar and Rakesh Sinha, it is the victory of "god" over "demonic powers" and "archaic secularism"
 abhinetri evam saamaajik kaaryakarta shabana azmi ne ise ''bahadur muslim mahilaon" kii jeet bataaya he
 Shaista Ambar of the All India Muslim Women's Personal Law Board called the decision a "victory for women and Islam"
 eiempielbi, jo mukademe main ek prativaadee or teen talaak kaa ghor pakshdhar tha, ne bhi is faisle ko ''nijee kanoonon kii jeet" qaraar diya he
 The opposition has carefully sent a congratulatory message to Muslim women on this
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne twit kiya ''supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat he
 "west Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who said in a poem on demonetisation that India will grant three divorces to Modi, is now tight-lipped on the issue
 makapa netaa vrinda karaat ne ''alpsankhyak mahilaon ke sangharsh ko hathiyaane kii koshish" ke liye bhaajapa ko aade haathon liya he
 Director of the Center for the Study of Society and Politics, Kanupar A
 ke
 Verma agrees
 ve kehete hai ki pradhanmantri kaa teen talaak kaa mudda uthaane ke ranneetik kadam ne chunavi taur par bhaajapa ke liye khel badal diya he
 In the 2017 assembly elections in UP, the BJP got a stunning 311 seats out of 403
 yahaan 100 se zyada muslim bahul vidhansabha kshetra hai, jahaan bhaajapa kii pehle kabhi maujuudagi nahin rahi thi
 Varma says, "but this time in the Muslim majority areas in UP, most of the votes went in favor of BJP
" yahaan tak ki devband main bhi, jahaan 71 pratishat aabaadi musalamaanon kii he
 "this had shocked BSP supremo Mayawati, which made her feel that voting machines were manipulated
 darasal, pradhanmantri ne chunaavon se pehle khule taur par kaha tha ki muslim mahilaon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaron kii raksha kii jaaegi
 She says this was a perceived threat to reach out to Muslim women by raising the issue of triple talaq, which benefited immensely

 There was fierce legal debate between the two factions even though they were under formal courtesy of the court
 justise nariman ne bahumat kaa netritv kiya or adaalat ne 3-2 ke faisle se teen talaak kii vyavastha ko khatm karke kanoon ke shashan ko barkaraar rakhaa
 Two judges (justice Nariman and Justice Lalit) dismissed it as "unconstitutional"
 justise joseph ne ise gaiyr-islamic hone ke aadhaar par khaarij kiya tha
 According to Justice Nariman and Justice Lalit, triple talaq is a violation of the fundamental rights of the Indian Constitution under Article 14 (equality before law)
 justise joseph ne bhi aisa hi raay jaahir kii lekin ek alag tark ke aadhaar par
 He said that there is no provision of triple talaq in the Quran, therefore it is un-islamic and does not give the right to protect Article 25 (right to Religious Freedom) under the Constitution

 Darul Uloom, Deoband still maintains on the old stand that it is a case of Sharia and law cannot interfere in it
 muslim personal lau board faisle kaa adhyayan karne ke baad 10 sitambar ko kaarysmiti kii baithak main rukh spasht karegaa
 "the courts and parliament should not interfere in religious issues," says Maulana Maulana Mukrati Abul Qasim Nomani Banarasi, Mohtamim of Darul Uloom, Deoband
 ol india muslim personal lau board jo bhi faisla karegaa, ham uskaa samarthan karenge
 Sharia will not tolerate any interference

 "all India Shia Personal Law Board Vice President Maulana Drs
 kalbe sadik is faisle kaa swaagat karte hue kaha, ''supreme court kaa faisla sahi he
 The Shia community has already divorced three divorces
 "jabaki devbandi vichaardhaara se jude aalimon ke sanghathan jamiyat ulema hind ke rashtriya adhyaksh moulana arshad madani kehete hai, ''desh ek baar sampradayikta kii jad main aakar bant chukaa he
 Therefore, the government should work in full consciousness
 teen talaak par supreme court kaa faisla sahi he
 "apart from this, Maulana Shahabuddin Rajvi, the national general secretary of Bareilly's Alim Dargah Ala Hazrat, Bareilly, has a different opinion
 ve kehete hai, ''dargah aalaa hazrat sthit sunni bareli marakaj kii ore se supreme court main punarvichaar arji di jaaegi
 "three divorces are not allowed in the previously unreasonable Qur'an and Hadith to say three divorces together
 islam ke pehle khalipha abubakar siddiq ke mutabik ek saath boli gai teen baar talaak ek hi talaak maani jaaegi
 Divorce thrice will be given at three different times at intervals of one month
 islam ke duusare khalipha umr faruk ke samay kuch dinon tak yah vyavastha rahi, lekin talaak ke maamle bade to unhone ek saath teen talaak ko manyata to di, lekin yah vyavastha bhi di ki aisa karne vaale kii peeth par jakhmi hone tak kode barasaaye jaaenge, taaki log ek saath teen talaak bolne se daren
 Imam Ibne Taymiya, the all-time greatest thinker of Islam in the 13th century, considered triple talaqs as inappropriate
 devbandi vichaardhaara ke ulema maanate hai ki bhale hi yah tarika sahi nahin, lekin talaak to ho gaya
 They accept the second caliph's simultaneous triple talaq arrangement, but ignore the order of whipping and wounding

 - VVS Laxman (@ vvslaxman281) October 6, 2015 upi ke cabinet mantri ajam khan or rajyapal ram nik ke bich takaraar badhati ja rahi he
 The Governor has currently put on hold the dream of securing the removal of Azam's mayors
 unhone uttar pradesh nagar nigam (sanshodhan) vidheyak 2015 ko raashtrapati ke paas bhej diya he
 In such a situation, now President Pranab Mukherjee will decide whether the rights of the mayors in UP will be cut or not
 kya he vidheyak memrashtrapati ko rajbhavan kii ore se 'uttar pradesh nagar nigam (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2015' or 'uttar pradesh nagarpalika vidhi (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2015' bhej gaye hai
 According to Raj Bhavan, some of its currents are against democracy
 prastaavit vidheyak ke tahat nigam adhinium, 1959 main nai dhara 16-e jodi gai he, iske jariye sarkaar nagar nigamon ke meyar or nagar palika chairman ke khilaaf shikaayat par kaaran bataao notice jari kar sakati he
 Not satisfied with the answer, the government can withhold all administrative and economic rights of the mayor and chairman
 aise shuru hua vivadadrasal, yah puraa vivaad vidhansabha main ajam khan ke rajyapal par die gaye bayaan se shuru hua
 Governor Ram Naik's outcry over the alleged remarks of Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan in the Assembly sparked controversy in Samajwadi Party and Raj Bhavan
 vivaad kii shuruyaat 8 march ko tab hui, jab nagar vikaas mantri ajam khan ne kaha ki sadan main paarit kiye jane ke baad bhi rajyapal nagar nigam sanshodhan vidheyak ko manjuuri nahin de rahe hai
 The manner in which the Governor has stopped this bill for a year, it seems that they are working under the influence of a particular party
 ajam ko lekar akhilesh karen vichaariske baad sadan main apane bare main ajam ke kathith taur par aapattijanak tippanee ko gambhirtha se lete hue nik ne vidhansabha adhyaksh se is bare main anedited sidi or recording kii copy muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha tha, jo unhen 15 march ko uplabdh karai gai thi
 After watching the CD, the Governor wrote a letter to the Speaker, saying that the minister's language was not in accordance with the dignity, dignity and tradition of the Assembly
 sadan main sansadeey kaary mantri kaa bhaashan sansadeey kaary mantri ke rup main unki yogyata par sawalia nishaan lagaataa he
 The Chief Minister should think about this
 vidheyak ko lekar pehle bhi ho chukaa he hangamanagar nigam sanshodhit vidheyak 2015 rajbhavan main manjuuri ke liye fansaa padaa he
 Azam Khan also questioned the deadline for any bill to be stopped in the Raj Bhavan
 baharhaal vidhansabha main spikar ne governor kaa bachaav kiya tha or mantri ajam khan kii 60 line kii tippanee main se 20 line ko kaarywahi se hataa diya tha
 The President will consider the questions raised by the Governor on the advice given by the President
 iske aadhaar par vahab vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ke sandarbh main rajyapal ko suzav bhi denge
 The most important thing is that just as there is no time limit for the consideration of the Governor, in the same way the President can also consider the Bill for an unlimited time
 aise main is vidheyak kaa philhal latakana tay mana ja rahaa he

 The total value of the seized gold is Rs 27 lakh
 police ke anusaar aropiyon se kul 832 gram sona jabt kiya gaya he
 The special thing is that the accused was carrying gold as a paste to avoid getting caught
 police kii jaanch me pataa chalaa he ki aaropee ise mumbai se hyderabad lekar ja rahaa tha
 During the security checkup at the airport, the police suspected him
 jab uski talaashi lee gai to uske bag se sona niklaa
 In the initial police interrogation, the accused has said that he was given this gold by one of his friends
 police ne philhal use giraftaar kar liya he
 Also, the whole matter is being investigated
 bataa den ki airport paratskar kii giraftaar kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he

 The Delhi High Court has said that private schools can also include their assigned criterion in the nursery admission along with the guidelines of the Delhi government
 gauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar ke notification ke baad didie kii jameen par bane skool admician ke liye apana criteria tay karne se vanchit ho gaye the
 Nursery Admission: Now the form will be filled till 31 January, although the decision on the nursery admission is yet to be decided by the High Court, but to avoid delay in the process of submission of the admission form till 31 January, the High Court has approached the private schools to decide their admission The form has been allowed to be sought on the basis of rules
 aisa isliye kiya gaya he kyonki 19 janvari ko honi vaali agali sunwaayee ke baad jab court kaa faisla aaye to usase skulon ko forms kii scrootni karne me samay naa lage
 Admission in Oxford University is even more difficult than admission to nursery schools in Delhi? This time the decision will be decided on the basis of the court's decision whether the nursery admission will be based on the schools' own criterion or on the basis of the notification of the Delhi government
 privet skulon kaa tark he ki sarkaar kaa nebarhud ko lekar notification parents or bacchon se unke manapsand skool main admician lene kaa moulik haq unase chhinta he
 While the Delhi government argues that its notification is in the favor of the parents and the management quota has been scrapped for their interests only
 is maamle me ek jaj ne maamle kii sunwaayee se ye kahkar inkaar kar diya ki unka betaa bhi inhen privet skulon me se ek me padhai kar rahaa he
 Therefore, the matter should be referred to another bench for hearing
 ab is maamle kii sunwaayee justise manmohan kar rahe hai
 In such a case, the hearing to be held on January 19 will be very important because it will decide on what basis the nursery admissions will be done this time

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The news of the discovery of gold which has caused panic in the entire country, the treasure of which the agencies of the Government of India are engaged in the search, today the same treasure was rejected
 khaarij karne vaale koi or nahin, khud khudaai kar rahi sanstha he
 Now a big question has arisen that when there is no treasure, why dig? Is there any scientific basis for this excavation or is it just a spectacle? In Chunargarh Fort, the demand for the discovery of treasures 'forget gold'
 
 
 'dondia kheda gaanv main khudaai kar rahi sanstha orcyological survey aaf india (ASI) ke khudaai nideshak saiyad jamaal hasan ne yah khaarij kar diya he ki koi sone kaa khajaana milane vaala he
 The treasure, the dream of which Union Minister Charan Das Mahant had told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has been told wrong before the excavation
 sadhu shobhan sarkaar ne jo sapana dekha, us sapane ko bharat sarkaar ke puraatatv vibhaag ne pehle hi khaarij kar diya
 Secret of the world's largest treasure
 
 
 aakhir kyon ho rahi he khudaai?sawaal uthta he ki agar jameen ke neeche khajaana nahin he, to khudaai ho kyon rahi he? iskaa jawaab he jiyological survey aaf india (GSI), yani jameen ke neeche kii jaanch karne vaali bharat sarkaar kii sanstha kii report
 It is being told that there is a possibility of something like metal in the report
 yah kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Also, it will be thousand tons, it is also not necessary at all
 mahakhajane ko lekar fatehgarh main badmaashon kii dastakagiological survey aaf india kii vah report janata se saamne nahin ai he, isliye kisi ko nahin pataa ki report main likhaa kya he
 By the way, GSI usually gives its report for mining of minerals
 agar saal 2012 kii jiesai kii report dekhen, to uttar pradesh main unnav ke aasapaas koi bhi aisi jagah nahin he, jahaan sone jaisi koi cheez jameen ke neeche dikhi ho
 Then how can it happen that not a hundred, two hundred tons, but a thousand tons of gold have escaped the sight of GSI? So is the digging of gold just a dream casserole or can there be a treasure there too? The complete excavation will take months, the excavation is going on in the palace that ruins the king in Unnao
 ek hajaar ton sone kii baat sunakar log dur-dur se pahunchane lage hai
 PAC personnel have been deployed to control the crowd
 lekin jis raftaar se khudaai ho rahi he, is kaam main maheenon kaa vakt lagegaa
 Laborers started reaching Raja Rao Rambakhsh Singh's palace with shovels
 afasaron kii nigaraanee main mahal main khudaai kaa kaam jari he
 All this is happening for a dream
 sapana shobhan sarkaar naam ke ek sant kaa he, jinka daawa he ki is mahal kii khudaai se ek hajaar ton sona nikalegaa
 But the great scientist and former President APJ Abdul Kalam is also rejecting this dream
 jaaniye koun hai shobhan sarkaarhad to yah he ki jis eesai afasar kii aguwai main khudaai kii ja rahi he, unhone khudaai ke duusare din hi sona ke sapane ko khaarij kar diya
 The ASI team turned out to take thousands of tons of gold, has turned the saint's dream
 khud orcyological survey of india kii team ab kehane lagi he ki vah yahaan sona nahin, samskruti kii talash main pahunchi he
 Take a look at the dream of the monk and the facts related to it: - Actually, this dream was seen by a saint Shobhan Sarkar, who lives not in Unnao but in his ashram in Kanpur countryside
 -22 sitambar, 2013 ko pehali baar kendriya krishi rajyamantri charandas mahant se shobhan sarkaar kii pehali baar mulaakaat hui thi
 Charandas was called by Shobhan Sarkar to see the irrigation project developed by him
 -isi mulaakaat main shobhan sarkaar ne mantriji ko sona or mahal kaa sapana suna daalaa
 Charandas Mahant wrote a letter to the Prime Minister after returning from there

 Ever since the Muzaffarnagar violence, Nitish Kumar has been taking the lead from other leaders in dealing with communal violence
 nitish sarkaar ne sampradayik dangon main maut kii maaavja raashi badhaakar paanch guna kar di he
 That is, if there were deaths due to communal violence in Bihar, the victim's family would get compensation from one lakh to five lakh
 nitish sarkaar ne iskaa faisla mangalvaar ko hui cabinet kii baithak main liya
 At the National Integration Council meeting, the way Nitish Kumar stressed the need to rein in communal riots and suggested measures for not to repeat the riots like Muzaffarnagar, it was clear that Nitish is seen as taking a lead on this issue
 Will not leave any stone unturned
 dangon main 5 lakh kaa muaavja puure desh main sabase zyada hoga
 It is worth noting that Nitish Kumar has already demanded a strict ban on religious visits inspired by politics
 saath hi bihar main har jile main danga nirodhak dasta tainaat karne kii vakaalat kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, after returning from the meeting of National Integration Council, the way Nitish has taken this decision, it is clear that he wants to be at the forefront of the country with a policy of zero tolerance on communal violence as well as those who heal wounds
 yahi vajah he muaavje kii ye raashi desh ke kisi bhi rajya ke mukaable sabase zyada hogi
 However, Nitish is leaving no stone unturned to become a bigger champion than Lalu in view of the Muslim vote in Bihar
 haalanki sarkaar ne is muaavja niti ke elaan main dango ke alaava aatankwaad or ugravadi hamalon main maare jane waalon ko bhi itani hi muaavja raashi dene kaa elaan kiya
 He is the most powerful person of his party
 uske saamne achche bade netaa bhi baithne yaa tikne se kataraate hai
 In today's time, BJP means Amit Shah and Amit Shah means BJP
 iske alaava or isse aage peeche kii sari sidhiyaan dhwast si yaa shaktiheen maaloom detii hai
 But look at this picture carefully
 tasviir vrundavan main chal rahi rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii samanvay baithak kii he
 Officials of the Sangh and its related organizations have gathered in this meeting
 or in padaadhikariyon kii baithak main peeche se teesri pankti main bhaajapa kaa yah sabase taqatvar cheharaa bhi nazar aa rahaa he
 bjp's General Secretary Ramlal is together
 sangh kii teen din kii yah baithak ek sitambar ko shuru hui
 During this meeting, the Sangh discusses its domestic and external issues and takes feedback on the functioning
 alag-alag hisson main or vibhinn kshetron main ho rahe kaamkaaj kii report lee jaati he
 Discussions are held on the hurdles coming in the work, there is a discussion on all the current topics and at the same time there is talk on the harmony between the government and the organization
 amit shah party adhyaksh ke naate or raamalaal party main mahaamantri ke naate is baithak main upasthit hue
 It is believed that some other BJP leaders may also be summoned in this meeting
 lekin mul rup se zimmedaari party ke netritv kii he
 This is the reason why, despite being overburdened with the preparations for cabinet expansion and the strategy of Gujarat and Himachal elections, Amit Shah had to register for the Sangh meeting
 haalanki hajiri kii ek badi vajah cabinet vistaar bhi he
 The car cannot move forward without the Sangh's stamp on the way the Modi cabinet is being finalized
 or isiilie amit shah ko vahaan pahunchnaa padaa jahaan sangh ke sheersh netritv or chehre upasthit hai
 Also read: Faggan Singh Kulaste said- Resigned at the behest of Amit Shah, Amit Shah has also arrived with his list and he has to reply to the leadership on the list of questions of the Sangh and also to take directions for further preparations
 amit shah is baat ko achche se samajhate hai ki zamin par jis patibaddhta or taiyaari ke saath sangh unki takat banataa he, vaisaa bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta bhi nahin kar sakate
 And this is the reason why Amit Shah, despite being so powerful, gives the head in front of the Sangh
 mantrimandal main badal rahe chehron se lekar upi or anya rajyon main paidaa hui tazaa sthitiyon or jatiltaaon par bhi amit shah ko sangh kii class main upasthit rahanaa he or paath yaad karne hai
 He had to focus on the party's image and upcoming elections at this time
 unhen taiyaari kerani thi aarthik morche par ghiri sarkaar ko logon ke bich sanbhaalane kii
 But for all this the Sangh's recommendation is also needed
 or isliye bhi amit shah ek vidhyaarthee kii tarah baithe hai sangh kii baithak main
 However, some of the seniors who have left the party have been constantly questioning the functioning of the party and have expressed concerns about lack of self-observation and lack of democracy in the party
 lekin sangh kii baithak main anushaasan aisi tamaam takaton ko darkinar kar bade se bade netaa ko ek swayamsevak tak simit kar detaa he
 Such an example is no longer seen in any political party other than the Left

 sabhi ko sikkon kii kami ke baad hone vaali dikkaton kii chintaa sata rahi he
 Markets are slowly recovering from the effects of demonetisation, but now the way the coinage has been stopped, the coins will disappear from the markets in the coming days
 haalanki dhalaai par abhi asthai roak lagaai gai he, lekin dukandaaron kaa maananaa he ki iskaa asar jald hi bazaaron main dikhne lagegaa, jab ajtak ne bazaaron kaa survey kiya to paaya ki aane vaale dinon main sikkon kii killat se log buree tarah pareshaan ho sakate hai
 INA Market is one of the major markets of Delhi Delhi
 yahaan kapadon se lekar har tarah kii chizein milti he
 There is a plethora of ration shops as well as dry fruits chemists and food joints
 iene market association ke pramukh ramesh kaa kahana he, 'hamaari chemist kii shop he, jahaan ek disprin kaa patta 4 rupee kaa miltaa he or ek ino 7 rupee kaa, ab jab sikkon kii killat hogi, to ham chaar rupee ke disprin ke badale khule paise kaise lautaaenge
 Customers are not ready to take any goods in exchange for open money, in such a situation, it will be natural
 bengali market, dilliye bazaar dilli ke sabase puraane bazaaro main se ek he or yahaan khaane-pine kii mashhoor chizon ke saath-saath steshnari or chemist kii dukaan he
 Here too, shopkeepers believe that if there is a shortage of coins, the shopkeepers as well as the customers will have to face difficulties
 ek 25 rupee ke samose ke liye koi card kaa istemaal nahi karata, mithaiyon se lekar khaane ke snacks bhi online nahi liye jate, aise main cash bhuktan hi hota he or chuttay paison kii jarurat bahut padati he
 We transact open money ranging from 500 to 1000 rupees a day
 agar sikke kam hue to sab par asar padegaa
 Hooda Market, Gurugramaye Bazaar is one of the major and major markets of Gurugram
 yahaan par bhi choti-badi har tarah kii dukaane hai, jahaan logon kii khachaakhach bheed hoti he
 The owner of a dairy present here said, 'milk sells for Rs 38 or Rs 18 a packet
 ab log to 50 kaa note yaa 20 kaa pakadaa dete he, par agar sikke nahi hue to ham unako kya denge
 Right now we have to give coupons ranging from 2 to 9 rupees, the situation will become difficult in the future
 'ek housewif sunita bhi isse naakhush dikhin
 He said, 'my government is requesting not to close coins, now we have not overcome the ban on demonetisation and now the coinage will spoil the budget, from dhobi to hawkers, the money keeps on peaking, when it is completely closed
 We will have to give more, because they will not bear the burden
 'gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne asthai taur par 1 rupye 2 rupee or 5 rupee kii dhalaai kaa kaam puri tarah se roak diya he, jiske kaaran desh me sikkon kii jarurat se zyada dhalaai ko bataaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, a large number of coins were made after demonetisation and the increasing number of online transactions at the smallest level has reduced the consumption of coins, due to which the coins are stored in large numbers and the minting of coins till the next order of RBI Has been stopped

 Economic interests of cricketers have to be seen

 Ganguly became the captain of the Indian cricket team in 2000, while Team India was in a shambles
 usase pehle ke daur main match phixing scandle kii kaali chaaya se bhartiya cricket ko guzaranaa padaa tha
 Ganguly not only boosted the morale of the players with his aggressive captaincy but also reinforced the belief that Team India can win abroad as well
 ganguli bisisiai kaa adhyaksh pad sambhalate hai to isisi main unki board room ranneetiyon par sabaki nazren rahengi
 How will Ganguly perform in this new innings, boards of other countries will also be interested in this

 This is a big opportunity for me to do something
 aap chahen nirvirodh chune jaaen yaa duusare tareeke se, ye badi jimmedaari he kyonki ye cricket kii duniya kaa sabase bada board he
 India is a power house
 ye chunauti hogi
 "when India Today asked Ganguly to compare his feelings with the times when he was the captain, he said," There is nothing greater than being the captain of India
 ’kya aapboard adhyaksh hone kii ummid kar rahe the to ganguli ne kaha, “maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main adhyaksh banuunga
 "but India Today came to know from sources that while discussions were going on, Ganguly was only interested in handling the top post in the board
 brajesh patel ko nahin mila samarthanganguli ne jab anya kisi pad ko sanbhaalane kii ichha nahin jataai to purv cricketer brajesh patel kaa naam bhi adhyaksh pad ke liye uchhla
 But Patel's name did not get enough support and the BJP lobby in the BCCI also wanted to see Ganguly as the president
 is ghatnakram ne baaji ganguli ke paksh main mode di
 There is also a discussion that the ruling BJP has made a deal with the cricket star to be ready to be the face of the party in the next election battle of Bengal or at least to play the role of star campaigner
 haalanki ganguli ne aise kayaason se saaf inkaar kiya
 Ganguly said, 'there is nothing like that
 kisi ne mujhe aisa nahin kaha
 Ganguly can himself appear at the BCCI headquarters on Monday to fill the form
 supreme court ne chetavanee dete hue kaha he ki dharm ke naam par hamalaa yaa hatya ko jaij nahin tehraaya ja saktaa

 In its judgment, the court gave strict warning against such crime and said that an attack or murder in the name of religion cannot be justified
 supreme court ne sabhi adaalaton se bhi kaha ki ve apane aadesh main aisi koi tippaniyan na karen jo kisi samudaay jati yaa dharm ke paksh main yaa khilaaf mahasoos hon
 The court quashed the High Court order granting bail to the accused in the Pune murder case and sent the case to the High Court for reconsideration
 court ne kaha ki maamalon par sunwaayee karte samay adaalat ko desh ke samras samskruti or bahultavaadi samaaj kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 The Supreme Court said that it is possible that the accused behind the crime should not have personal enmity with the victim, but religious hatred
 is bare main hoicourt ke jaj kaa iraadaa kisi samudaay kii bhavanaaen aahat karne kaa nahin hoga, lekin ye tippanee aalochanaon ko bal detii he
 The High Court, while granting bail to the murder accused, in its order said that the accused had no personal enmity with the deceased
 mritak kaa kusur sirf itnaa tha ki vah duusare dharm kaa tha
 While canceling the bail of the accused in a murder case of 2 June 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, the Supreme Court said in their judgment that the accused had committed a heinous crime like murder

 There is an uproar over theft in the Radha Krishna textile market of Surat
 radha krishna kapadaa market bharat kaa sabase bada kapadaa bazaar mana jaataa he
 There are five to six thousand cloth shops here
 jab se yahaan pichley kai ravivaar ko dupliket chaabi kii madad se maal chori kii ghatana saamne ai he, vyapaariyon ke hosh ude hue hai
 All are checking stock of their goods and watching the recording of CCTV
 sari dukaanon main sisitivi camere nahin hai or jinke yahaan hai, bahuton ke paas nite vijan nahin hai
 Since last Sunday when the theft incident occurred in four shops, 20 traders have filed firs
 sisitivi camere kaa teen maheene se zyaada kaa byaap nahin hota he isliye chori kaa sahi andaaza milanaa mushkil he
 So far, theft has been reported in more than a hundred shops
 ek dukaan se ek baar main paanch se saat lakh kaa maal paar kar detaa he
 The thief does not target that shop again
 yah sari jaankaree surat ke kapadaa vyapaariyon ne phone par di he
 He says the theft has been happening for the past several Sundays
 har ravivaar ko 40-50 dukaanon se maal paar kar surat ke hi duusare ilaake ke godaam main rakhaa jaataa he
 If you guess the price, then there is a possibility of theft of goods worth more than 200 crores
 ravivaar ko maal chori kar market main hi rakhaa jaataa tha
 Then it was taken out on Monday
 kyonki bazaar kaa niyam he ki ravivaar ko band rahata he
 If someone has to open a shop, then he can open it till four o'clock in the evening by giving special permission and fees
 uske baad market khaali karnaa padataa he
 Apparently theft takes place only after that
 police jaanch kar rahi he
 Two godowns have also been caught where the stolen goods have been kept hidden
 chor pakadaa jayega, iskaa aashwaasan diya ja rahaa he
 But traders doubt the market management itself
 federation of textile treders association (phosta) kii aalochana ho rahi he
 How are these thieves happening after four o'clock in the evening without their knowledge
 ravivaar ko market se maal baahar nahin ja saktaa to market main hi rakhaa jaataa hoga
 In this organization, political organizations are accused of being weak
 chori se pehle sisitivi or internet band hone kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 If the internet was on, merchants would keep looking at the pictures of the shop on their mobile phones
 magar band ho jane se sampark tut gaya
 Not only this, the police also do not cooperate when traders go to complain of theft
 suurate ke vyapaariyon kaa kahana he ki ve aae din tarah tarah kii choriyon se pareshaan rahete hi hai magar jab se is tarah kii chori kii ghatana saamne ai he, unke hosh ud gaye hai
 Therefore traders are performing consistently
 market ko band rakhaa he
 Today, India's largest textile market is closed for the fourth day
 media main ise kanoon vyavastha kaa prashn nahin banaaya jayega
 If Bihar was UP, there would be uproar
 lekin gujarat he to 200 karod kii chori bhi saamaanya ho jaati he
 These news are discussed in the local newspapers but who consider it a discussion
 karodpati vyapaaree hairaan hai ki unki bhi samasya ke liye godi media main jagah nahin he
 They are asking me to do something
 main akelaa kya kya karun

 On one hand, Swami Om, once hurt by the talk of 'apni Beti' Priyanka Jagga, once again became emotional, on the other hand, Priyanka managed to crack the friendship between Manu Punjabi, Manveer Gurjar and Monalisa
 'gai captency pani main' task ke dauraan manu-manavir or mona kii ladaai ho gai jiske baad mona rone lagi
 However Manvir and Mona settle their quarrel in Manu's mediation
 subah naashte ko lekar gharavaalon or chalanjaron ke bich bahes ho gai
 On needing gas to make breakfast, Alina said that the first householders should show what they are preparing for breakfast, then they will ride the cycle
 idhar manu or manavir charchaa karne lage ki chalanger room main bani ke hone kii vajah se yah sari pareshaani ho rahi he
 At the same time, the director of the work, Priyanka did not understand the whole thing about the challengers, because of this there was a lot of debate between the householders and the challengers
 dopaher ko 'big bos' ne 'jab tak tere paanv chalenge' task ke khatm hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said that as the task manager, Priyanka did not meet the expectations of 'bigg Boss' due to which she is not a contender for the next Captaincy
 iske baad 'big bos' ne kaha ki captaini ke donon daavedaar 'gai captency pani main' task se hi chune jaaenge
 During this time, when Nitibha called Om Swami as Priyanka's father, she was shocked that she was not his father and there was no need to add his name to him
 isse om swami aahat ho gaye, jab manavir ne unhen samajhane kii koshish kii ki unhen logon se ummid nahin kerani chahie to vah rone lage
 Nitibha told Om Swami that he is cute but makes everyone angry with his antics
 iske baad monalisa ne manu ko bataaya ki test tub khaali karne ke liye manavir baar baar use ishaare kar rahaa he
 Finally, when four test tubes were left, when Manveer asked Mona to throw them, Mona asked why he was being forced again and again
 iske baad manavir or mona ke bich bahes ho gai, manavir is baat se aahat the ki mona or manu ne ab tak unhen nahin samajha he
 Manu asks Manveer to talk slowly, Manveer told him that he listens to everything that does not mean that he cannot walk on his own
 iske thik baad priyanka ne mona se kaha ki manu mona se ek test tub khaali nahin karvaa paa rahaa he, yahi un logon kii dosti he? iske baad washroom main manu ne lopa or rohan ke bare main baat karte hue kaha ki log dosti kaa kachra kar rahe hai, is par manavir ne kaha ki manu bhi vahi kar rahe hai
 After this both of them got into an argument though Manu handled the case
 is dauraan jhagade se aahat priyanka ro rahi thim, unke baahar aane ke baad manu ne manavir se kaha ki vah mona se baat karke aapas ke diference clear karen, unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisi tisare ko apni baatcheet main shaamil karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Late in the night, members of Team Indiawale kept discussing that if Monalisa empties the test tube, then none of Manveer and Manu become captains
 is par manu ne mona ko kuch bhi kehane se manaa kar diya
 Priyanka tells Manveer that she is no friend to anyone but being friends, Manu shouts at Priyanka that she tells Gaurav that she will make him captain, tells Manveer to tell her and Manu that she will make him captain
 manu ke jane ke priyanka ne manavir se kaha ki yadi vah abhi nahin samajhate hai to kabhi nahin samaj paaenge
 Late in the night, Manu told Manveer that Priyanka wants to break the friendship between Mona and those people, she is playing the game
 agle episod ke snike peak main hamane dekha ki captency ke liye mukhya muqabla gaurav or manavir ke bich hoga, vahiin lopamudra or om swami ke bich bhi ladaai dekhne ko milegi

 In the 10 weeks of Modi Raj, we came to know that the BJP has nothing new to give

 The matter is getting heated up politically in the state following the statement of former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh seeking proof of the air strike
 rajya ke do purv mukhyamantriyon ne ab unke khilaaf hamalaa bol diya he
 Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan targeted him fiercely and said that he has become blind in opposition to Modi and is speaking the language of Pakistan
 bijepi ne unke bayaan kii aalochana karte hue ravivaar ko puure pradesh main pradarshan kaa elaan kiya he,rajya ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne digvijay singh kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki vah modi virodh main andhe ho gaye hai
 The problem is that Digvijay Singh is speaking the language of Pakistan
 ye desh ke liye kalank he
 He further said that while opposing Modi, Digvijay Singh has started opposing Bharat Mata
 unke bayaan ke virodh main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) aaj ravivaar ko puure pradesh main congress ke netaaon dwaara nirantar apmaan kiye jane ke virodh congress kaa putala jala rahi he or dhikkaar sabhaayen kar rahi he
 He accused Digvijay Singh that he had already destroyed Madhya Pradesh earlier
 ab vah desh ko tabah karne kii koshish main lage hai
 He said, 'I condemn his statement and language
 sena pramukh tak is airstrike par pisi kar chuke hai
 If they are not able to accept the military strength of our army then it is a shame
 'chunaav main milegaa air strike kaa phaaydahbabulal gauramadhya pradesh ke ek or purv mukhyamantri babulal gaur ne bhi digvijay par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki sena ke pradhan ne saboot de to die
 The head of the army does not belong to any party
 vayusena pramukh, thal sena pramukh, jal sena pramukh ne saboot de to die unase prashn kiijie
 He further said that he is sorry for why the Congress has not taken the action that Narendra Modi has taken so far, 182 people were killed in the 26 / 11 attack inside Mumbai and no one took action at that time
 unhone aage kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi pehali baar kah rahe hai ki sena swayan karrwai karen
 Babulal Gaur, after giving a big statement, said that the benefit of this air strike can be given to BJP in the coming Lok Sabha elections
 gaur ne kaha ki digvijay singh ko apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar he, lekin wo chunaav se dar rahe hai kyonki iskaa laabh narendra modi or bijepi ko milegaa
 This is a political matter and the BJP will benefit because in every war only the ruling party gets the benefit
 bhai unhone (aatankwaadiyon) ne sena ke javaanon ko maaraa, sena ne unako maaraa
 Digvijay gets son's support Amidst the attack by the BJP, the minister of urban administration in the Kamal Nath government and Digvijay Singh's son Jayawardhan Singh supported his father's statement
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii saraahna ke bayaan par jayavardhan singh ne pita kii pairvi karte hue kaha, 'maine bayaan suna he, unhone koi galat baat nahin kii he
 On asking for evidence of the air strike, Jayawardhan said, "how much damage has been done, they are just asking for this information and the country is also asking for this information
" ' saath hi jayavardhan ne bijepi par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki bijepi baukhalaahat main he kyonki 15 saal main wo jo kaam nahin kar saki use congress ne satta main aane ke mahaj 60 din main kar diya or isi kii baukhalaahat bijepi main dikh rahi he or in dinon uske netaa anaap-shanaap bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 Digvijay to apologize: Before BJP state president Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Madhya Pradesh BJP state president and MP Rakesh Singh also called Digvijay Singh's statement unfortunate and called him a Pakistani

 During the research, we faced many problems

 i asked some scientists and researchers for help with my project but they felt that me and my partner are too small and not eligible to do such a big project

 ) a few hours before the elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh, the fight between each of the SP and BSP mlas has resulted in a fight and thorn
 ab bhi dasvin seat ke liye sabhi partiyaan jod-tod kar rahi hai
 The strength of the united opposition has been reduced to a few votes
 lekin siton kaa ganit abhi bhi kuch aisa he ki kisi kii bhi jeet aasaan najar nahin aa rahi
 No party has the full number i
e
 37 votes
 do vot katane se vipaksh kii takat hui kamailahabaad hoicourt ne basapa ke vidhayak mukhtaar ansaari ke vot dene par roak laga di he
 The SP has also suffered a setback
 jail main band sapa vidhayak hariom yadav ko jail prashasan ne jane se manaa kar diya he
 With this, the BSP with 19 mlas has come down to 18
 36 par tehra vipaksh, 1 seat se jeet doorasapa kii baat karen to unke paas kul 47 vidhayak hai
 Of these, Nitin Aggarwal, son of Naresh Aggarwal, is believed to be voting in favor of BJP
 hariom yadav ke vot na de paane kii surat main yah sankhya 45 ho jaaegi
 Jaya Bachchan is in the field from SP
 isamen se sapa kii ek seat surakshit karne ke liye 37 vot nikaal den to bache 8 vot
 The SP will contest votes for Mayawati only after the victory of its candidate
 aise main sapa ke bache hue 8 vot, basapa ke 18, congress ke 7 vot or areldi kaa ek vot jod den to kul hote hai 34 vot
 Raja Bhaiyya's feud can be formed in Roda
 Two independent mlas who can join the SP camp are Raja Bhaiya and his close Vinod Saroj
 is tarah vipaksh puri takat laga bhi le to jaadui 37 se ek vot kam yani 36 vot hi rah ja rahe
 But the question is, will Raja Bhaiya vote for Mayawati's candidate? Because Raja Bhaiya's feud with Mayawati is well known
 agar raja bhaiya ne dushmani nibhaa di to bispi kii mushkil or bad sakati he
 But with the arrival of Shivpal Yadav, its fears have reduced considerably
 31 par thahari bijepivahin bijepi kii baat karen to jaadui number unke paas bhi nahin he
 BJP has a total of 311 mlas in the assembly
 iske alaava apana dal (es) ke 9 vidhayak, kal tak baagi tevar dikhaane vaale suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke netaa or cabinet mantri om prakaash rajbhar ke chaar vidhayak saath hai
 If we combine allies, this number reaches 324
 itane baari-bharkam number ke saath bijepi 8 seat to behad aasaani se jeet rahi he
 But he has 28 votes left for the ninth seat
 bijepi ko naresh agarwal ke bete nitin agarwal, amarmani ke bete amanmani or bhadohi se vidhayak vijay mishra kaa vot milane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 By combining these three votes, BJP gets a total of 31 votes which is 6 less than the magic number
 vipaksh 1 to bijepi 6 vot ke liye laga rahi takatis tarah puri takat lagane ke baad bhi vipaksh jahaan 36 vot tak hi pahunch paa rahaa, vahiin bijepi 31 tak pahunch rahi he
 The whole battle is on these numbers
 vipaksh kii koshish he ki kisi bhi tarah se uske ek vot kaa jugad ho jaae
 At the same time, BJP was trying to get 6 votes
 cross voting par tikaa puraa khemb jeet kaa faisla cross voting se hoga
 That is, the votes of rebel mlas will matter
 bispi pratyaashee bhimrao ambedkar kii jeet kaa sara daaromadar ab vipaksh ke upar nirbhar karata he
 The SP, Congress and RLD have announced their support for the BSP candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections
 raja bhaiya kaa rukh bhi kaaphi myne rakhata he
 In Anil Agarwal and Bhimrao Ambedkar, 11 candidates are in the fray for the 10 seats of the contesting UP
 soobe ke maujuuda vidhayakon kii sankhya ke lihaaj se bijepi ke 8 or sapa ke ek sadsy kii jeet tay maani ja rahi
 There is a close contest between bjp's 9th candidate Anil Agarwal and bsp's lone candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar

 Gloria Stanem first instance
 ummiido ko turant pankh lagane kii
 In 2000, the news came from a large Phogat family from Sydney in Balali village of Bhiwani district of Haryana
 vetaliftor karnam malleshwari ne kaansya padak jeeta tha
 It was India's only medal at the Olympics and the first ever by an Indian woman
 glassgo kaamanwealth games main freestil kushti main jite apane padak kii sunahari abha main damakati 24 varshiya babitha phogat yah baat kehete hue malleshwari ke padak se sidhaa naata jodatii hai: mahavir singh phogat ne apane kunbe ke saare bacchon ko gherkar kheton main kushti sikhaanaa shuru kar diya taaki ve bhi padak jeet saken
 Mahavir, himself a wrestler, taught his daughters, sons, nephews and nieces what he used to come
 shaayad unhen bhi is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki unhone kya shuruyaat kii he
 Her eldest daughter Geeta won gold at the Delhi Commonwealth Games in 2010 and became the first Indian woman wrestler to qualify for the Olympics in 2012
 babitha ne dilli ke rajat ko glassgo main swarna padak main tabdeel kar diya
 Cousin Vinesh is not even 20 years old and has returned from Glasgow with a gold medal
 apane kheton ke sire par khandaani akhaade main photo khinchvaate samay uski ankhon par neend haaavee thi
 The family is still not satisfied
 chote bhai-bahan ab bhi cadet yaa junior khitaabon kii ummid main akhaade se andar-baahar hote rahete hai
 Unbeknownst to all the noise and search for missing Glasgow medals at home, Jeannie, younger than five years, is taking training on machines
 phogat parivaar ke doordaraj ke vanshaj balaali ke akhaade main chachaa mahavir kii sone kii talash main shaamil hone pahunch rahe hai
 Many stories are heard about the way the Phogat sisters have challenged or defied social beliefs
 lekin asian khelon kii training or trial ke liye jane se pehle unhone gaanv main vijay chakkar lagaaya, or uske baad pradesh kii rajdhani main, dilli ke televijan studios main unhen kai baar janaa padaa
 Babita and Vinesh have to struggle to do all this
 babita bataati hai ki jab ve mitti ke akhaade (mat unki pehali safalataa arjeet karne ke baad ai) main pehali baar utrin to kaanaafoosee hoti thi, “gaanv vaale kaha karte the, ‘ab ke hoga’
 We used to practice with the boys, talk to them and wear necker
 ”vinesh kahati hai, “tab ham bachche the
 What do good children know about these social traditions? ”the medals reinforced such objections
 bhala champion kaa bahishkaar koun karegaa? babitha ne bhartiya khilaadi ke dildaar andaaj main mana ki unki kamyaabi kaa bharat or khaskar haryana ke sandarbh main kya mahatv haih aaj ve us samaaj ko dhul chataane vaali pahalwaan ban gai hai, jisamen kokh main hi bacchee ko maarane se lekar ant tak mahilaon ko samaaj se baahar rakhaa jaataa he
 Babita folds her hands and says, "don't kill them
" hamen dekho
 We are also girls
 ve ham se aage ja sakati hai
 "perhaps she does not give as much importance to overcome the traditional belief about women to present herself as a role model of her sport and her tradition of lifelong dedication
" babitha maanati hai ki ve har baar jab bhi bada toornament jitkar lautati hai, to gaanv main kushti main dilchaspee bad jaati he
 She says, "but they want immediate results
 unhen yah nahin dikhataa ki yahaan tak pahunchane ke liye maine 10-12 saal pasinaa bahaya he
 Those days of training in the Phogat family are fondly remembered
 har kisi ke paas bataane ko koi baat he or aisa lagata he ki sab kul milakar ek jaise naatakeey andaaj main smritiyaan taaja karte hai
 Babita recalls the fun of childhood days, “papa used to wake us up at 3:30 in the morning
 ham do-dhai ghante practice karte the
 Father used to rotate the fields
 uske baad bees minute ghar main aaraam hota tha
 Then take a bath, eat and go to school
 skool main akasar jhapai aa jaati thi
 Especially when the teacher's face was towards the blackboard
 kabhi-kabhi ve hamen sone detii thim
 Returning home for an hour and then training
 ravivaar ko skool se chuttee hoti thi lekin training se nahin
 "vinesh is younger and a bit thinner than her sisters (they wrestle in the 48 kg category while Babita and Geeta wrestle in the 51-55 kg class)
 vinesh ne bataaya ki chot lagane ke dar se bahanon ke saath akhaade main utarane main hichakati thim, “taoojee poochhate the, tu koi gulab kaa phool he?”mahavir phogat sakht guru hai or babitha ne dabi jabaan main bataaya ki training se bachane ke liye ve kisi-kisi tikadam lagaati thim
 Sometimes they would move around and go back to sweat and guess how much training was done
 ladkiyaan sarson ke patton par jami os se maathaa geela kar leti thim
 He had got the inverter installed so that the training did not stop even when the electricity went out
 ladkiyaan use frij se jod detii thim, taaki bijli jane par bydaree khatm ho chuki ho
 But now there is no fear of punishment for coming on Matt
 ve apni technic or furti par kaam kar rahi hai or unhen us khel kaa shubhankar bataaya ja rahaa he, jisase mahila pahalawaanon se ummiden bad gai hai
 There was a possibility of wrestling being dropped from the Olympic Games last year
 usase ubarkar mahilaon kii shreniyan badhaane or purushon kii kam karne kii koshish ho rahi he
 Babita's eyes glow with pride stating the new equation, "two boys' medals less, Freestyle and Greco Roman, seven to six each, and two more girls, ie four to six
 to baraabar ho gaye na 6-6-6” (mahila kushti sirf freestil he)
 Wrestling began in the ancient Olympics
 lekin nae jamaane main pahchaan banane main use mahila pahalawaanon se sahi daanv lagavane kii jarurat he, jinhen 2004 main athens se olympic ke akhaade main utarane kii ijaajat mili he
 The Phogat sisters want to be outnumbered in the 2016 Rio Olympics
 philhal training or tryles ke liye ve lakhanu main hai
 The World Championships and Asian Games are back and forth, and the dominance of Japanese and Chinese women wrestlers is such that whoever gets the first place will enter the Asian Games arena in Incheon, South Korea
 isse pehle parvatarohi santosh yadav jaisi mahilaon ne haryana main mahilaon ke khilaaf peedi-dar-peedi chalati aa rahi dharna ko todaa
 Wrestlers like Sushil Kumar of Delhi aroused India's interest in this ancient sport of the twenty-first century
 parivartan ke vaahak ke rup main phogat bahanon kii anuthi bhoomika, shaayad unki joshili paariwarik mahagatha main shaamil hone ko utsuk kuch or pahalawaanon ko aakarshith kar sakegi

 kartarpur coridar par pakistan kaa doharaa ravaiya saamne aayaa he
 On Thursday, an important meeting of Home Ministry and Foreign Ministry officials was held regarding the corridor, in which Pakistan has refused to accept the talk of India
 coridor ko lekar ajtak ko grih mantralay ke sutron se ahm jaankaree mili he, jiske mutabik jo bhartiya dailygation meeting main shaamil hua tha, usne apane shraddhaluon ko lekar kai ahm maangen pakistan ke saamne rakhin, jinhen pakistan ne maanane se inkaar kar diya
 India objected to these demands of India 1
 bharat ne kaha tha ki 5000 yatri har din kartarpur sahib ke darshan karen or kisi khaas din jaise baisakhi, gurupurnima ke samay 15000 yatri pratidin darshan karen
 But Pakistan denied this in the meeting
 usne kaha he ki rojaanaa sirf 500 shraddhalu darshan karenge
 But the number is very small according to India
 2
 India had demanded that all Indian citizens and OCI card holders should visit Kartarpur Sahib, but Pakistan said that only Sikhs will go there
 sutron ke mutabik pakistan yahaan par dharm ke aadhaar par baantne kii koshish main juta hua he
 3
 bharat ne pakistan se kaha ki ek parivaar yaa phir ek group chaahe jitani sankhya kaa ho usko kartarpur ke darshan karne ke liye pakistan ijaajat de
 But Pakistan did not listen to India here too and said that only and only a group of 15 devotees can visit India at one time
 bharat ne isko lekar aitraaj jataayaa
 4
 bharat ne kaha ki koi vyakti chaahe gaadi se jaae yaa phir wo darshan karne paidal janaa chahta he wo ja saktaa he, ye uski ichha ke anusaar hona chahie
 But even here Pakistan has run its arbitrary and said that no one can go on foot across the border
 darshan karne vaala shraddhalu sirf or sirf gaadi se hi ja saktaa he
 5
 kartarpur sahib ko maharaja ranjit singh ne or kuch shraddhaluon ne milakar 100 acre jameen daan main di thi
 Pakistan is using this land for itself
 bharat ne kaha kii 100 acre jameen kartarpur sahib trust main rakhaa jaae
 Pakistan also denied this during its meeting
 grih mantralay ke sutron ne ajtak ko jaankaree di he ki pakistan ke saath 1974 main ek emoyu bharat or pakistan main sthit donon deshon se jude dharmik sthanon ko lekar hua tha, jisamen 15 dharmik sthaan pakistan main the, jinako bharat ke shraddhalu darshan kar sakate hai or 7 dharmik sthaan bharat main hai jinako pakistan ke shraddhalu darshan kar sakate hai
 Pakistan did not include Kartarpur Sahib in the mou during 1974
 bharat ab chahta he ki donon deshon ke bich main ek kartarpur sahib ko lekar emoyu ho jisase bharat ke shraddhalu achche tareeke se darshan kar saken par pakistan yahaan bhi apana adiyal ravaiya apanaate hue bharat ke delygation ko yah kaha ki vah sirf or sirf 2 saal ke liye hi emoyu par sin karnaa chahta he
 However, India also objected strongly to this, but Pakistan believes that it does not believe that here too, it is busy showing its tricks in full ways
 bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne upie sarkaar ke vaidhata kho dene or uskaa janadesh samaapt ho jane kaa daawa karte hue elaan kiya he ki vah is bhrasht sarkaar ke khilaaf november se pehle desh bhar main rath yatra nikaalenge
 "this government is responsible for the worst scam," said 83-year-old Advani, who has defended two former mps of his party who were sent to jail in the cash-for-note note case
 vot ke badale note kaa maamla yaheen khatm nahin hoga
 i have an idea to take a trip across the country, for which i have received approval from the party president
 unhone kaha, is yatra kaa naam or swaroop kya hoga or yah kahaan se shuru hogi, ise lekar kuch kalpanaaen hai, jinhen jald hi antim rup de diya jayega
 Immediately it will be against corruption, but its issue will also be based on good governance and clean politics
 ham isamen bhrashtachar, kalaadhan or naitik aacharan kaa vishay bhi uthaaenge
 On the question of whether this would be a rath yatra, Advani accepted, it would be similar to a rath yatra
 november tak sansad satr nahin hoga, isliye yah usase pehle hi hogi
 It is worth mentioning that Advani has taken out Ram Janmabhoomi Rath Yatra, Mandate Yatra, Swarna Jayanti Rath Yatra, Bharat Uday Yatra and Bharat Suraksha Yatra earlier
 kya yah yatra reddy bandhuon ke prabhaav kshetra bellari or narendra modi shasit gujarat ke ahmedabad se bhi niklegi or kya vah note ke badale vot maamle ko lekar pradhanmantri kaa istipha maangenge, is par endie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh ne kaha, is par faisla abhi nahin kiya gaya he
 i take such things as suggestions

 Jinping's statement came at a time when there is tension between China and its other neighbors over border-related matters
 china kaa dakshin purv asian sagar main japan or dakshini china sagar main kai duusare deshon ke saath vivaad he
 He has a border dispute with India, which is trying to find a solution through negotiations

 Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal United is to face assembly elections in Bihar in November this year

 ’’ The Election Commission refused to give information under RTI, did not give back to the complaints of code of conduct against PM
 There is an enigma for the people
 The Election Commission website was when Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora was announcing the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections
 us dauraan unhone bataaya ki loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf jo bhi shikaayatein mili thim, unamem se 99 fisadi shikayaton ko maatr do din main nipta diya gaya
 When reporters asked him questions on the criticism of the Election Commission against the PM for violating the code of conduct, he said, "99 percent of the complaints were settled within 48 hours
" "aroda jo sandesh dena chaahate the vah saaf tha ki chunaav ayog aachaar samhita ko lagu karne ke maamle main nishpaksh or chaukanna tha
 But the questions received by India Today from the Election Commission under the Right to Information (RTI) in June, the answers received, tell a different story
 is artiai aavedan main chaar sawaal the:1) loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan piem modi ke khilaaf chunaav ayog main aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kii kitni shikaayatein ain?2) in shikayaton par gaur karne ke liye kitni baar ayog kii purna bench vichaar karne baithi?3) kya in shikayaton par ayog kii purna bench ke faisle main matbhed tha?4) agar chunaav ayuktaon main aapasi asahmati kaa koi dastavej ho muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 The answers that the Election Commission gave to India Today were literally something like: 1) The information you have asked for is not available collectively
 in maamalon kaa alag-alag section / divijan main nipataara kiya gaya or in soochnaaon ko artiai act 2005 ke section 7(9) ke tahat sangruhit karke uplabdh nahin karaayaa ja saktaa
 You can ask questions to get information, especially with the complainant's name, state etc
 2 & 3) sawaal kii shakl main jo soochna maangi gai he, artiai act 2005 ke section 2(f) ke tahat vah 'soochna' kii shrenee main nahin aati
 4) The information you have asked for cannot be made public under 8 (1) (g) of RTI Act 2005
 ise saarvajanik karne par kisi vyakti vishesh ke jivan yaa shaareerik suraksha yaa pahchaan kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 This information is confidential from a law and security point of view
 sankshep main kahen to 26 july ko die gaye apane jawaab main soochna ayog ne koi soochna nahin di
 Broadly, the Commission gave two arguments for refusing to answer: a) The Election Commission does not have a combined figure of complaints against Modi
 b) artiai kanoon ke tahat ayog kii purna bench ke bare main soochna nahin maangi ja sakati
 India Today's RTI team appealed to the Central Information Officer of the Election Commission
 kendriya soochna adhikari ne 20 sitambar ko die apane jawaab main daawa kiya ki aachaar samhita se jude sabhi faislon ko ayog kiwebsitepar saarvajanik kar diya gaya he
 The reply stated, "the appellant is informed that in the case of the Code of Conduct, the grievances are settled on the basis of the report of officers at the field level
 faisle ke pehle likhe gaye note vaale hisse main field str se di gai reporton or vichaaron kaa sandarbh hota he
 This is why the Central Information Officer has cited section 8 (1) (g) of the RTI Act
 haalanki, apilkarta ko suchit kiya jaataa he ki aachaar samhita ke maamalon main sabhi shikayaton par jo bhi faisle liye gaye hai, unhen chunaav ayog kiwebsitepar aplod kar diya gaya he
 "but when India Today went to this link and searched in the name of Modi, we got only one result
 haalanki, vah ek pravishti bhi abujh paheli thi
 The first page open in the search says that on 10-11 April, Udhamsingh Nagar of Uttarakhand received a complaint regarding alleged distribution of sari related to Modi
 lekin jab india today kii team ne "view details" batan par clic kiya to jo pej khulaa vah hamen kareeb aadha dashak peeche le gaya
 Here the date of complaint was showing January 1, 1970, but there was no information in it
 jab hamane "download PDF" vikalp par clic kiya to jawaab aayaa: "maaf kiijie, aap jo panna talash rahe hai vah khoja nahin ja sakaa
 " dadri kii ghatana par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bayaan ke baad mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ne un par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki unke dwaara ghatana ko durbhagyapurna bataaya janaa bahut hi 'kam or vilamb se' uthaaya gaya kadam he
 RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav reacted strongly, saying, what kind of silence is it to break?

 'tippaniyan He said on Twitter, 'BJP, RSS and Modi are the same

 Lalu's response came after his interview in PM Modi's Bangla daily Anand Bazar Patrika, in which he accused the opposition of adopting false secularism and doing politics of polarization, as well as the Dadri murder case and Ghulam Ali in Mumbai
 The concert was canceled as 'unfortunate', but PM Modi also said that his government had nothing to do with these incidents

 aurangabad (maharashtra) Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is unhappy with Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan's stand
 rahul gandhi ne apni naaraazgi loksabhaa netaa vipaksh kaa pad or sadan main congress ko jawaab dene ke liye samay nahin die jane par jataai he
 Actually, all the members of the Congress party met on Tuesday in the Parliament complex
 isamen rahul or sonia gandhi ne bhi hissaa liya
 Rahul said this again and again, 'it has been said before the speaker and the government that no application has come from the Congress regarding the opposition leader
 jiske baad congress ne upie ke sabhi ghatak dalon se hastakshar karakar spikar ko is sambandh main kagajaat die the
 After which the speaker Sumitra Mahajan was assured of taking action soon
 lanbaa samay biit chukaa he phir bhi spikar kaa koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 'let me tell you that in July, Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of Congress Parliamentary Party in Lok Sabha, had sent a signed letter of 60 mps to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and submitted his claim on this post
 is baithak main party ke varisht netaa kamalnath ne rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unhen khud aage aakar morcha sanbhaalanaa hoga
 Apart from the UPA, coordination with other opposition parties has to be increased
 unki maangon ko samarthan dena hoga tabhi jarurat padane par ye partiyaan congress ke saath aaengi
 Everyone will have to meet with the speaker once again in this regard
 tabhi jaakar sarkaar or spikar par dabaav banaaya ja saktaa he
 Let me tell you that the Congress is the second party with 44 seats in the Lok Sabha
 lekin 545 sadasyon vaale sadan main netaa pratipaksh kii haisiyat ke liye anivaary 55 sadsy sankhya se party pichad rahi he
 The BJP is bent on denying the Congress the Leader of the Opposition citing the same rule
 jammu kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatankwaadi hamale main shahid hue siarpief ke sabhi 40 javaanon kii pahchaan unke aadhaar card, idi card or kuch anya saamaanon ke jariye hi ho pai
 Officials said that due to the huge explosion, the bodies of the soldiers were badly mutilated, so it was difficult to identify them
 in shaheedon kii pahchaan aadhaar card, unke idi card, pan card or unki jebon yaa baigon main rakhe chuttee ke aavednon se kii ja saki
 Senior officials said that some of the bodies were identified with watches and their purses tied in wrists
 ye saamaan unke sahyogi ne pahachaane the
 40 soldiers are named in the list of martyred soldiers in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 siarpief ke kafile main 78 gaadiyaan thim or kareeb 2500 jawan shaamil the
 Initial information was that the Jaish terrorist had loaded 350 kg RDX in the SUV
 lekin sutron ne bataaya ki aatanki esayuvi main nahin, balki ek car main tha or usamen 350 nahin 60 kilo ardex rakhaa hua tha
 At the same time, sources also said that the blast was carried out by overtaking from the left side
 notebandi ke faisle kaa joardaar dhang se bachaav karte hue sarkaar ne kaha he ki yah kadam rashtriya hit main uthaaya gaya he or isse desh main bhrashtachar, kalaadhan evam aatankwaadi gatividhiyon par lagaam lagegi or dirghakaal main arthvyavastha ko laabh milegaa
 Union Minister Piyush Goyal intervened in the discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the opposition's adjournment motion regarding demonetisation, saying that the Modi government's denial of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes aimed at curbing corruption, black money and terrorism The country has welcomed the decision
 unhone kaha, 'lekin kuch logon kaa is bare main chintit hona swaabhaavik bhi he
 The Minister of Power, Coal, Mines and Renewable Energy, Goyal said, "this decision has honored honest in the country and has led to loss of dishonesty
" unhone kaha ki is kadam kii vajah se kuch pareshaani to honi hi thi, lekin iske baavjood logon ne iskaa samarthan kiya he
 Goyal said that when the new government took office in 2014, the country was embroiled in corruption and scandals
 ab modi sarkaar ne ek kadam uthaaya he, jiske madhyam se vah logon kii apekshaaon par khare bhi utre hai
 He said, 'but there are others who are not happy with this step
 yah bhrashtachar, aatankwaad, nashili dawaaon ke khilaaf ladaai kii disha main ek mahatvapurn kadam he or raajnneetik dalon ko is par khush hona chahie
 ' notebandi ke kadam ko uchit tehraate hue goyal ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki uplabdh dastavejon or reporton ke aadhaar par bhartiya rigerv bank ne mahasoos kiya ki badi maatra main rakam yaa to vitarit nahin ho rahi he yaa sarkari khajaane main nahin aa rahi he
 He analyzed that this amount was hidden
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar iske bare main vishesh aankade nahin bataa sakati, lekin arabiai ne sarkaar ko ek prastaav diya jise mantrimandal ke samaksh rakhaa gaya
 The move was approved by the Cabinet
 goyal ne kaha ki eemaandaaree se kamaaye gaye dhan par koi roak nahin he, isliye kisi ko samasya nahin honi chahie
 On the objections raised by the opposition, Goyal said that some people are saying that seven days or ten days should have been given, but secrecy is most important for such a step
 notebandi ke phaayde bataate hue goyal ne kaha ki dirghakaal main byaaj daren kam ho jaaengi, mahangaai ghategi or karon kii daren neechein aaengi
 Goyal said, "even if five percent of the people do not pay taxes, then 95 percent of the people have to bear the brunt and they pay the price
 agar kar diya jaataa he to centre sarkaar ke paas kisaanon, mahilaon, anusuchit jati janajati tathaa pichde varg ke logon or anya ke kalyaan ke liye kaam karne ke vaaste adhik dhan uplabdh hoga
 ' unhone uttar pradesh main asann vidhansabha chunaavon main phayda uthaane ke maddenjar yah kadam uthaae jane ke vipaksh ke aarope ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki aise bayanon kii asaliyat isi baat se sabit ho jaati he ki log is kadam kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 The comments goyal ne kaha ki kuch log kah rahe hai ki sarkaar ko un logon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karnaa chahie, jinke swiss bank or anya videshi bainkon main khate hai, lekin agar aisa kiya gaya to sarkaar ke liye aise khaaton ke bare main or jaankaree hasil karnaa mushkil ho jayega

 Where the MNREGA scheme changed the fortunes of UPA-1 in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, now the focus of UPA-2 is to bring a similar ambitious law
 congress nit upie sarkaar bhoomi adhikaar kanoon ke jariye 2009 ke nateezon ko dohraane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 In the wake of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the UPA has drafted an ambitious land reform law that aims to provide land to landless families living in villages
 draft ke mutabik bhoomihin pariwaron ko jameen di jaaegi jiskaa istemaal ghar banane ke alaava aamadani arjeet karne ke liye kiya ja sakegaa
 According to the law, at least 0 to the landless poor

 The draft of this law has been prepared by the Special Committee on Land Reforms
 is samiti kii adhyakshata kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh kar rahe hai
 It will be sent to other UPA ministers on March 18 to take feedback on the law
 centre sarkaar is kanoon ko monsoon satr main sansad main pesh karne kii taiyaari main he taaki isse chunavi phayda hasil kiya ja sake
 Jairam Ramesh told Mail Today, 'our motive is that those who do not have their own land and houses should be given their rights
 kuch vaise hi jaise mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium or van adhikaar kanoon ke jariye garib janata kii madad kii gai
 'he said,' The government is committed to giving rights to the landless poor in the country
 'congress party kaa bhi he saathaankado ke lihaaj se is bhoomi sudhaar kanoon kaa masauda behad hi krantikari he
 According to the 11th Five Year Plan, there are 13 lakh to 18 lakh landless families in the country
 upie kaa maananaa he ki mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise muddon kii vajah se agle chunaav main use shahari matadaataaon kii berukhi kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 In such a situation, his eye is on the rural voters, to woo them, the party is ready to adopt all the tricks
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki upie ne indira awaas yojana, pradhanmantri gramin sadak yojana or cash sabsidi skim jaisi yojanaon ko zyada tavajjo di he
 Also, the proposed Land Reform Act will also be another important step in this direction
 upie kii is ranneeti ko congress kaa bhi samarthan he
 Party spokesperson Rashid Alvi said, 'congress is in favor of land reforms, we are committed to giving land to the landless people so that that class has a house to live in and can live with dignity
 'haalanki is kanoon ko jamini hakeekat banane main adchanon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Matters related to land are under the state government
 aise main kisi kendriya kanoon kaa prabhaav simit ho saktaa he
 Congress sources said that in such a situation Congress-ruled states would have to come forward to implement the law
 ek baar jab kanoon in rajyon main sucharu dhang se lagu ho jayega
 Then there will be pressure on the rest of the states to implement it
 congress kaa anumaan he ki yah kanoon loksabhaa chunaav main party ke liye madadgaar sabit hoga
 It has become fashionable these days to adopt new tricks for the promotion of films
 
 
 aamir khan apni film ke pramotion ke liye kabhi banaras kii galiyon main bhatakate hai, kabhi patna ke autoricshaw vaale kii shaadi main pahunchakar dhyaan khinch lete hai
 
 
 Similarly, the team of the new film 'bol Bachchan' has given a new dimension to the promotion and marketing just before the release
 
 
 film ke sitare ajay devgan or abhishek bachchan tathaa nirdeshak rohit shetty kii team film kii khatir dilli main master chandgiram ke akhaade main pahunch gai or surkhiyaan bator leen
 
 
 Whether this new bet of Bollywood won him or not, he managed to get the wrestling game in the Olympic season
 
 
 vaise akhaade kii parampara ke mutabik in sitaron kaa khub jamkar swaagat bhi kiya gaya, or khaskar, chote bacchon main gazab kaa utsaah dekhne ko mila
 
 
 But now the media coverage that this promotion campaign is getting has probably started to fill the glamor color in Indian wrestling
 
 
 haalanki isi akhaade se nikalakar sonika kaliraman jaisi athleton ne khub naam kamaaya he, bollywood star akshay kumaar ke 'feare factor - khataron ke khilaadi' or 'big bos' jaise rielity sho main aakar naam bhi batora, lekin in sabaki badi vajah unki kaabiliyat ke alaava khud unka glamras hona bhi rahaa
 
 
 In the arena, several photographs of Marhoom Master Chandgiram remained witness to that occasion
 
 
 varsh 1970 ke bangkok asiad main swarna padak vijeta master chandgiram apane jite−ji bharat main mahila kushti ke bhi hero bane rahe
 
 
 By putting his sons and daughters in the game, he kept on trusting that he would definitely return on the day of the game
 
 
 so, aaj agar in sitaron ko chandgiram dekhte, to behad khush hote
 
 
 Without reaching the ground, it is not possible to feel the spirit of any game
 
 
 ajay devgan ne bataaya ki bachapan main vah bhi kabhi−kabhi kushti kiya karte the, isliye vah samajhate hai ki is khel kaa ek alag hi nasha he
 
 
 Ajay said, "the world of wrestling is completely different, and i believe that wrestling has not got the rights that other sports have been getting
" 
 
 tippaniyan These stars were serious about the game, and it should be considered a good initiative
 
 
 abhishek bachchan ko cricket bahut pasand he, or vah ipel kii mumbai indians team ke bade fain hai, lekin akhaade main pahunchakar vah bhi kushti se prabhavit hue bina nahin rah sake
 
 
 In the spirit of wrestling, he again expected Indian wrestlers to win medals in the Olympics
 
 
 abhishek ne kaha, pichhali baar bhi kushti ne padak jeeta tha, or is baar bhi agast main ham olympics padak zarur jeetenge
 
 
 Ajay Devgn plays a wrestler in 'bol Bachchan', so the film's promoters are trying to cash it in the arena as well
 
 
 film se kushti ko fouran phayda pahunche, na pahunche, lekin film kii team ko pataa he ki gaanvon or chote shaharon main kushti ke lakhon diwane hai or 100 karod ke club main pahunchane ke lakshya ke chalate unhone akhaadon ko bhi bhunaane kii yojana banaai he
 
 
 Whether this new bet of Bollywood won him or not, he managed to get the wrestling game in the Olympic season

 Although athletes like Sonika Kaliraman have earned a lot of name out of the same arena, Bollywood star Akshay Kumar's name shows such as 'fear Factor - Khatron Ke Khiladi' and 'bigg Boss' reality shows, but all of them are a big reason for his ability
 Apart from this, he himself was also being glamorous
 
 
 akhaade main marhoom master chandgiram kii kai tasviren us maukey kaa gavaah bani raheen
 
 
 Master Chandgiram, a gold medalist in the 1970 Bangkok Asiad, continued to be the hero of women's wrestling in India
 
 
 apane bete or betiyon ko is khel main lagaakar vah bharosa karte rahe ki is khel ke din zarur lautenge
 
 
 So, if Chandgiram had seen these stars today, he would have been very happy
 
 
 maidan main pahunche bina kisi bhi khel kii ruh ko mahasoos karnaa mumkin nahin hota
 
 
 Ajay Devgan told that he used to wrestle occasionally as a child, so he understands that this sport has a different intoxication
 
 
 ajay ne kaha, kushti kii duniya bilkul alag he, or main maanata hum ki kushti ko uskaa vah haq nahin mila, jo duusare sports ko miltaa rahaa he
