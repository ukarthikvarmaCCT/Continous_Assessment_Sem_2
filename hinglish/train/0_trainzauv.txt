 supreme court ne yachikartaaon se hai court kaa rukh karne ko kaha he
 The Supreme Court said that first approach the High Court on the Aadhaar case
 supreme court main yah yachika saamaajik kaaryakarta ripak kansal or purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne daakhil kii thi
 This petition stated that the ordinance brought on the grounds is against the democratic process
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki supreme court purv main aadhaar par die gaye faisle ko palat de
 The Ordinance on Aadhaar has been approved by the Union Cabinet to bring an ordinance to amend the Aadhaar law, which was challenged in the Supreme Court
 cabinet ke faisle kii jaankaree dete hue 28 farvari ko kendriya kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bataaya tha ki cabinet ne aadhaar ko svaichhik rup se mobile number, bank khaaton se jodne ko kanoonee aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye adhyadesh laane ko manjuuri di
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the Lok Sabha had passed the bill related to it on 4 January, but the bill could not be introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 isliye ab sarkaar yah adhyadesh laa rahi he
 Through these amendments, stringent provisions have been made to prevent misuse of Aadhaar and to maintain the privacy of the people
 ab kisi vyakti kii pahchaan ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary nahin banaaya jayega
 Why Aadhaar Ordinance 2019 can be challenged in the Supreme Court on two levels
 sanshodhano ko mul rup se sansad main ek bill ke jariye laayaa gaya tha jise loksabhaa main paarit kar diya gaya, lekin yah rajyasabha main paarit nahin ho sakaa
 It could not be given concrete shape before the end of the Parliament session
 isliye modi sarkaar iske liye adhyadesh lekar ai
 However, the ordinance can be enforced only in the event that the conditions specified in Article 123 of the Constitution are met
 yachikakartaon kaa kahana he ki aadhyadesh ke jariye kendriya sarkaar apni takat kaa durupyog kar sakati he

 — ᏢᎪᎡᏙᎬᏚᎻ 🏏 (@prvs8)april 24, 2017 The Delhi High Court has issued a notice to the Center and the Delhi government on the rising dengue outbreak in Delhi
 nyaayalay ne donon sarkaron se dengue se nipatane ke upayon ke bare main poocha he
 The Central and Delhi governments have been instructed to file affidavits in this regard in two weeks
 vahiin, dilli main dengue ke chalate marane waalon kii sankhya badhkar 14 ho gai he
 In the last 24 hours, two more people succumbed to dengue
 tippaniyan a three-and-a-half-year-old girl died of dengue in Delhi's Deoli area yesterday
 neha ke parivaar kaa kahana he ki do sarkari aspataalon main jane ke baavjood uski dengue kii jaanch nahin hui or sirf bukhaar kii dawa de di gai
 When there was a high fever, relatives rushed to Saket City Hospital with the girl, but the girl died during treatment
 vahiin, dengue ke badhate maamalon ke maddenzar dilli sarkaar ne ek ahm faisalaa lete hue dengue ke test ke liye lee jaani vaali fees ko 600 rupaye kar diya he
 That is, no more rupees can be collected in the name of dengue test in any private hospital
 is vakt dilli ke alag-alag aspataalon main dengue ke 2000 se zyaada mariz bhartee hai or ilaaj kii suvidhaayen bhi naakaafi hai kyonki marizon ke liye bistaron kii kami he
 At the same time, the Delhi government has also asked private hospitals to increase three to four thousand beds

 dilli ke devli ilaake main kal saadhe teen saal kii bacchee kii dengue se maut ho gai
 Neha's family says that despite going to two government hospitals, she was not tested for dengue and was given only fever medicine
 jab kaaphi tej bukhaar hua to rishtedaar bacchee ko lekar saket city aspataal pahunche lekin ilaaj ke dauraan hi bacchee kii maut ho gai
 At the same time, in view of the increasing cases of dengue, the Delhi government has taken an important decision to reduce the fees charged for dengue test to Rs 600
 yani kisi bhi nijee aspataal main dengue ke test ke naam par isse zyaada rupaye vasule nahin ja sakenge
 At present, more than 2000 dengue patients are admitted in different hospitals in Delhi and treatment facilities are also insufficient as there is a shortage of beds for the patients
 vahiin ab dilli sarkaar ne nijee aspataalon ko bhi teen-chaar hazaar bed badhaane ko kaha he

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter ishkbaaj ke 4 march ke episod main asipi ranvir singh randhaava apni maa kamini ke saath oberoi mension pahunchataa he
 Shakti is shocked to see Kamini, she is the love of her college days
 kamini ko dekh tej kaaphi khush hota he ki pinki or shakti kii life main ab drama dekhne ko milegaa
 Pinky tells Kamini that he should stay away from Shakti
 vahiin kamini shakti or tej se college ke dinon kii baaten karti he
 On the other hand, Shivaay tells Anika on the phone that due to urgent work she has to go out of the house, but she knows that at home she will handle everything and will not let anything go wrong
 idhar kamini kahati he ki use priyanka tabase pasand he jabase ranvir ne use uske bare main bataaya tha
 She says that she has brought all the items of the omen and will be stopped
 tej usase kahata he ki sabakuch bahut hi jaldi ho rahaa he, vah kahata he ki roka baad main bhi ho saktaa he
 Kamini interrupts him knowing that he has known her for years
 vah shakti kii taraf ishaara karte hue kahati he ki rishte jodne main zyada der nahin kerani chahie nahin to dooriyaan bad jaati hai
 Anika says that they should wait till Shivaay arrives for Roka
 rudra bhi kahata he ki shivaay ke bina roke kii rasm nahin ho sakati
 Rudra calls Shivaay, looking at the phone on the other side, Shivaay's attention shifts from the car as the balance of the car deteriorates and his car passes over some people sleeping on the road
 isse vah kaaphi dar jaataa he or car se utarkaar un logon ke paas aata he, haalanki tab use pataa chalata he ki vah kisi film kii shooting kaa seoup he
 However, someone would have been recording this entire incident on the phone so that Shivaay could be implicated in some conspiracy
 tippaniyan Sahil on the other hand returns home from Bangalore Trip
 anika use lekar andar jane lagati he itane main kamini use tok detii he ki shubh kaam main kisi apahiz ke hone se apshakun ho jaataa he, vah sahil ko ghar se baahar nikalne ke liye kahati he
 Ranveer stops Kamini but she gets angry at him
 vah sahil ko manahuus kehete hue use ghar se nikaalane ke liye dhakka detii he
 This makes Sahil fall down, all the people from the house find Kamini's behavior strange
 iske baad anika kamini ko rokkar kahati he ki sahil uskaa bhai he or usne ek or kadam uski taraf badhaayaa to usase bura koi nahin hoga
 Kamini gets into a scuffle between Anika, Kamini falls down with Anika's bang
 vah teble par apana sir markar khud ko chot pahunchaa leti he
 She then tells the Oberoi family that she is not rich like them but she will never forget this insult
 is par tej anika se kahata he ki vah kamini se maafee maang le
 But Anika says that it is not her fault
 isse naaraaz kamini vahaan se jane lagati he itane main shivaay vahaan pahunchakar unhen rokane kii koshish karata he
 Priyanka gets angry with Kamini's insistence on insistence, she tells them to leave, and says she does not want a beggar relationship
 kal ke episod main ham dekhenge ki daksh (shivaay ke bachapan kaa dost or anika kaa psico aashiq jisase anika kii sagaai hui thi) asal main asipi randhaava kaa bada bhai he or vah badla lene ke makasad se oberoi parivaar kii jindagi main waapas laut aayaa he
 Here Kamini says that she likes Priyanka ever since Ranveer told her about her
 vah kahati he ki vah shagun kaa sara saamaan lekar ai he or roka karke hi jaaegi
 Tej tells him that everything is happening very quickly, he says that Roka may be later too

 He probably would have liked to write the same slogan that was seen on the caps during the entire Anna movement, 'I am Anna Hazare
 ' lekin unhen anna ke naam or tasviir ke istemaal kii ijazat nahin he
 So he wrote, 'I am a common man'
 unhone 2 oktober 2012 ko hi apane bhavi raajnneetik dal kaa drushtikon patr bhi jari kiya

 kuch aisa hi somvaar ko congress adhyaksharahul gandhike saath hue jab unhone ek fasebuk post main galat rajya naam likh diya
 Actually, while sharing the news of the doors being opened for girls 50 years after the establishment of a Sainik School, Rahul Gandhi in his tweet wrote Manipur instead of Mizoram
 rahul ne fasebuk post main likhaa,''agar mauka mili to aisa kuch bhi nahin jo ladkiyaan nahin kar sakati
 These girls in the Sainik School of Manipur are proof of this
 in bahadur, prerit karne bacchon ko meri shubhakamanaayen
 You are the future of India
 hamen aap par garv he
 "while the military school that Rahul was talking about is in Mizoram and not in Manipur
 haalanki rahul ne apni galati main sudhaar kiya
 But Amit Malviya, the head of the BJPK IT cell, took Rahul Gandhi's tweet as an opportunity to target him, saying that Rahul Gandhi shared an article in Mizoram and wrote Manipur
 purvottar ke bare main unki agyanta badi samasya he
 Malaviya did not stop here, he wrote again in the tweet, 'rahul Gandhi go and write a hundred times that Mizoram and Manipur are two different states of Northeast India and i will remember this during the rest of my term as Congress President
 'rahul gandhi madhya pradesh daure par hai, jahaan unhone ujjain ke mahakaleshwar mandir main puja archana kii

 After which, after realizing his mistake, Rahul clarified that there were so many scams in Madhya Pradesh and BJP ruled states that he was confused

 ' Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has nationalist leanings, has millions of followers on Twitter, but follows only three people
 27 saal se unki patni aki abe, japan ke sarvaadhik pratishthit patrkaar, itihaaskaar or sahityakar naoki inose or bharat ke agle pradhanmantri narendra modi
 
 @narendramodigreat talking to you, Mr
 Modi
 i look forward to welcoming you in Tokyo and further deepening our friendly ties
 - 安 倍 晋 三 (@abeshinzo) May 20, 2014 Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo, who returned to power, has revived some of the country's declining economy
 unhone loksabhaa chunaavon ke nattejey aate hi desh ke agle pradhanmantri narendra modi ko badhai di
 Shinzo congratulated Modi on the phone, but Modi also thanked him on Twitter
 unhone apane twit main likhaa ki gujarat kaa mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan bhi japan ke pradhanmantri unke sampark main lagaataar the
 Modi said that even when the head of the western countries avoided contacting him, Shinzo also got him along
 modi ne ummid jataai ki ve donon milakar bharat or japan ke rishton ko nai oonchai par le jaaenge
 There are a lot of similarities between Shinzo and Modi, when Japan came to power, Japan had the same situation as India has now
 acchhee aarthik sthit ladkadaane lagi thi or desh nae sire se ummid kii aakanksha kar rahaa tha
 In such a situation, Shinzo effectively returned to power in 2012 after six years of misrule
 bijepi ke narendra modi bhi bhartiya logon khaskar yuvaaon kii desh ko nae sire se dharre par laane kii ummiido ke tale is mukaam tak pahunche hai
 Talking about the similarities between the two, strategist Brahma Chelani writes, 63-year-old Narendra Modi puts forward his philosophy like Abe's liberal nationalism
 donon hi apane mulk ko vaishvik pratispardhaa main aage le janaa chaahate hai or desh kaa yakeen nae sire se behaal karnaa chaahate hai
 Both have a lot of work to do at the policy level
 chelani likhte hai ki donon hi netaa bazaar aadhaarit arthvyavastha ke himachati hai or asian deshon main kareebi rishton ke mukhar himachati bhi

 agar aipal kaa yah patent hakeekat bana to smartphone kii duniya main dhamaakaa ho saktaa he
 Because reports are coming that American technology company Apple is working on a wireless technology that can charge phones through a wifi router
 abhi tak wireles charging kaa matlab ye he ki iske liye smartphone ko dock main laganaa hota he jise socket se conect karte hai
 That means it will be wireless charging
 aipal ne america patent or trademark offis main dualfrequency ke saath wireles chargingand communication system ke patent ke liye aavedan kiya he
 (wireless Charging and Communications Systems with dual-frequency Patch Antennas)
 patent kii website par yah isi naam se dekha ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that here it is a method through which power transfer can be done at a dedicated frequency for data communication
 US patent or trademarkophis main aipal ne is patent ke liye27 april 2017 ko aavedan kiya he
 In this, the patch antenna can be used for wireless power transfer at microwave frequency or it can also be used for millimeter wave communication
 haalanki aipal aisi pehali company nahin he jisane aise wireles charging keliye patent kiya he
 Earlier, Sony has also applied for a patent for a similar wireless charging
 itnaa hi nahin digni ke kuch riserchars ne ek research main yah paaya tha ki wifai kii tarah hi wireles charging sambhav he
 For this, he also released a demo video
 jaahir he company ise agle iphone main to nahin de sakati he,kyonki iske patent ke liye aavedankarna or ise feechar ke taur par launch karne main kaaphi samay lagate hai
 Most of the patents are subsequently dismantled during research and development
 lekin ummid kii ja rahi he aipal agle kuch saalon main is technology ko apane products main laa saktaa he
 However, in this patent filed by Apple, it is not clear in which product the company will use this technology
 mumkin he ise iphone yaa ipad main diya ja saktaa he
 Recently, the diagram of iphone 8 was leaking in which the place of wireless pad can be seen
 yah handset ke rier cacing kii taraf he
 Interestingly, this is the place where patch antennas occur and similar patches are mentioned in the patents filed by Apple
 iske alaava bhi iphone 8 main wireles charging kii kai reports ai hai or is baar company yah feechar de sakati he, kyonki iphone ke takkar ke sabhi smartphone main yah feechar diya ja rahaa he
 The example is the recently launched Galaxy S8

 Director Alankrita Shrivastava's film, Lipstick Under My Burka, tells the story of women's aspirations, irrespective of their age, religion or society
 is film main ek mahila kii puri jindagi kii kahani chaar paatro dwaara kahi gayi he jo umr ke alag padaav par hai
 How do these women strangulate their aspirations, trapped in the restrictions of society, family and the Ravites, and force them to live
 is film main rihana ( palabita borthakur) burke main kaid, apane sapanom or chaahaton ko parivaar kii paramparaon ke bandhanon se aaazaad karnaa chaahati hai, vahiin duusari taraf lila (aahana kumra) ek beauty parlor chalati he, par uske sapane bhopal kii tang galiyon se nikalnaa chaahate hai
 Talking about the shortcomings of the film, i do not consider it to be a shortage of time, but of a filmmaker, because earlier films have been made on such a subject and the most recent film that i miss is 'parcht'
 tulana kii jaae to us film main bhi kahani kii aatma 'lipstick under maai burka' jaisi hi thi, lekin har filmkaar ko apni tarah se apni kahani kehane kaa haq he par bataur aalochak meri mushkil ye ho jaati he kii vishay main phir utana nayaapan nahin lagata
 Apart from this, the second drawback of the film is a bit after the interval in the film, where the pace of the story of the film decreases

 What to do There is nothing except farming to raise a family
 ' nawarti ke bete bajrangi ne rajya sarkaar se maang karte hue kaha ki hamaara sab fasal kharaab ho gai he
 Government should announce some compensation, otherwise where will the farmers go

 Before addressing the students, Obama on Friday addressed the students at Illinois University in Urbana
 is dauraan unhone trump calmericamein hone vaale bantwaare or dhruvikaran kii vajah nahin balki uskaa lakshan qaraar diya
 Obama said that Trump is taking advantage of the same anger and resentment that politicians have been giving air to over the years
 obama ne kaha ki yah donald trump ke saath shuru nahin hua balki yah to ek lakshan
 He is only taking advantage of the anger that has been sown by politicians over the years
 obama ne kaha ki na sirf hamaare bhootkaal main ek dar or gussa boyaa gaya tha balki hamaare jindagi main hue utaar-chadhaav kii vajah se bhi yah gussa paidaa hua
 Obama said that unfortunately the politics of anger and fear has found a place in the Republican Party
 obama ne yahaan par kaha ki ye sirf democratic or republican ke bich nahin hona chahie or na hi log ye sochen ki ham kuch logon ke samoohon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 He said that we have to raise our voice against discrimination in the same way that we have been raising against those who are warm with Nazi thinking
 obama ne asaadhaaran taur par pehali baar vartmaan daur kii raajnneeti se judi apni chintaaon ke bare main baat kahi

 While the demand for a unilateral ceasefire placed by Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti is unlikely to be approved by the Center, according to sources, the leadership of the security forces is also not in a position to take such a step
 mahabuuba mufti ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki may ke madhya main ramajaan shuru hone se lekar agast main amarnath yatra sampann hone tak centre ko ekatarfa sijafire par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Due to this demand of Mehbooba, the BJP, the ally in the Jammu and Kashmir government, does not agree

 Ram Madhav objected to the word ceasefire
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav says that the Center has already appointed Dineshwar Sharma to talk to interested parties in Jammu and Kashmir
 ram madhav ne saath hi saaf kiya ki jahaan tak aatankwaadiyon kaa sawaal he to hamen unase sakhti se nipatna chahie
 According to him, the Indian government has not yet received any formal proposal
 ram madhav ne sijafire shabd par aapatti jataai he
 Ram Madhav said, 'we should not use a word like ceasefire in such a situation
 ram madhav ne kaha, agar aatankwaadi ramajaan main apni gatividhiyon se dur rahete hai, agar aatankwaad rukta he to surakshabalon ke oparation apane aap band ho jaaenge
 It is the duty of the security forces to protect the people
 ’ bataa den ki mahabuuba mufti ne buudhvaar ko sarvadaleey baithak main ekatarfa sijafire kii maang kii thi
 Home Ministry did not get any such proposal: Rajnath Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh says that his ministry has not received any such proposal yet, but they will raise the issue with Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti
 bijepi kii jammu or kashmir unit ne mahabuuba mufti kii maang ko ‘vivek se pare’ bataaya he
 Security forces not in favor of postponement of anti-terror operation Meanwhile, officials of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir say that the written proposal is unlikely because the initiative was taken at the political level
 sutron ke mutabik surakshabalon kii leadership bhi mahabuuba mufti kii maang maane jane ke haq main nahin he
 Sources said that the army or security establishment is not in favor of any ceasefire
 or naa hi ve aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf aaparishan ko sthagit karne ke paksh main he
 The terrorists will get a head lift from the ceasefire, says militant organizations like malshkar-e-taiba, jaish-e-mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen are currently without effective leadership and are under tremendous pressure
 elosi ke paas surakshabalon ke lagaataar oparation or pro-active stand ne ghati main aatanki sanghathanon kii qamar tod kar rakh di he
 The remaining gangsters of these terrorist organizations have also been running around here
 sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki sthaneey nagarikon kii ore se bhi aatankwaadiyon ke movement ke bare lagaataar suchanaaen milti rahati hai
 This shows that the common people of the valley are fed up with terrorism and violence
 sutron ke mutabik agar is vakt surakshabalon ke oparation ko sthagit karne yaa sijafire jaisaa koi kadam uthaaya jaataa he to isse aatanki sanghathanon ko hi phayda milegaa
 The 2016 incidents are also cited by the sources
 tab hijbul mujahidin ke aantki burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad ghati main bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan hue the
 The focus then shifted from anti-terrorism operations to a law and order duty
 isse aatanki sanghathanon ko dobaaraa sir uthaane kaa mauka mila tha
 After this, it took several months for the security forces to overcome the situation again
 sutara ye bhi kehete hai ki mahabuuba mufti ne sijafire kii maang kii he, lekin iske sharton aadi ke bare main or kuch saaf nahin kiya he
 Without a big political initiative, a ceasefire will not make a difference in the situation in Jammu and Kashmir
 acha nahin rahaa anubhavsutra ye bhi kehete hai ki ghati main ateet main oparation ko sthagit karne yaa sijafire ke anubhav achche nahin rahe hai
 During Atal Bihari Vajpayee's prime ministership, the decision to ceasefire or 'combat Operations' (NICO) was taken

 Even then the army was not removed, only the siege and search operation were postponed
 lekin wo pahal naakaam rahi kyonki aatankiyon ne srinagar airport samet kai jagah hamalon ko anjaam diya tha
 On an average there are 48 boys every month, the sources involved in the terrorist organizations, along with the figures, told the situation of terrorism in the valley
 sutron ke mutabik 2018 shuru hone ke baad se ausatan har maheene 48 sthaneey ladke aatanki sanghathanon main shaamil hote rahete hai
 Also 22 local boys are missing
 unke bhi aatanki sanghathanon main shaamil hone kii ashanka he
 The security forces are looking to bring them back to the mainstream
 lekin unhen mukhyadhara main tabhi liya jayega jab unhone kisi aatanki gatividhi main hissaa nahin liya hoga
 Sources said that an estimated 70 foreign terrorists are now hiding in the valley
 aatanki sanghathanon main jin nae ladakon ko shaamil kiya gaya he, wo prashikshit nahin hai
 Therefore, the security forces have little difficulty in overcoming them
 agar suraksha balon ke oparations sthagit kiye jate hai to aatankiyon ko dobaaraa ekajute hone or sangathit hone kaa mauka milegaa
 The security forces are looking for Riyaz Nikku, Zeenat ul Islam and some other terrorists these days and can reach them soon

 Former finance minister and senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who came into the limelight after an article in a newspaper, appeared in front of the media for the first time today and attacked the Modi government fiercely
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki ham upie-2 ke samay policy paralisis kii baat karte the, lekin aaj bhi nitiyaan waisi hi hai
 The speed at which the execution of projects should have accelerated did not come into this government
 40 maheene tak sarkaar main rahane ke baad ab ham puraani sarkaar ko dosha nahin de sakate
 The public was given double shocks in the form of demonetisation and GST
 narendra modi sarkaar kii aalochana karne vaale yashavanth sinha ko bete jayant sinha kaa sakht jawaab Yashwant Sinha told ANI that for a long time we know that India's economy is declining
 iske liye ham pehle kii sarkaar ko dosha nahin de sakate kyonki hamen puraa mauka mila
 Has been in government for 40 months
 jiesti kaa main bhi samarthan karata hum lekin ise lagu karne main sarkaar ne jaldbaaji kii
 i am the only one except the Congress finance minister who has presented the budget 7 times
 aaj desh kii janata chaahati he ki rojgaar mili, par jisase pucho vahi kah rahaa he ki rojgaar nahin mil rahaa
 Shatrughan Sinha, who came to the rescue, told Yashwant Sinha - Tested - tested wise person yashavanth ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke samay ham log policy paralisis kii baat karte the
 Projects worth millions of crores were stalled then
 un pariyojnaon ke liye bainkon ne lakhon karod kaa lone diya tha
 Banks' money was also snapped by the hanging of projects
 bainkon kaa 8 lakh karod fansaa he
 Problems were further exacerbated by the way GST was implemented
 1 july se jiesti lagu karnaa jaldbaazi thi
 a falling economy does not create employment
 ek jatke main desh cashles nahin ho saktaa
 Only welfare schemes do not give impetus to the economy
 gauratlab he ki purv vittamantri yashavanth sinha ne buudhvaar ko ek angreji akhbaar main lekh likhakar girti arthvyavastha ko lekar arun jetali par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Yashwant Sinha wrote that Arun Jaitley has been the biggest face in this government so far
 cabinet main naam tay hone se pehle hi unka naam tay tha ki jetali vittamantralay sanbhaalenge
 Despite losing the Lok Sabha elections, no one could stop him from becoming a minister
 sinha ne kaha ki isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main jaswant singh or pramod mahajan bhi vaajapeyi ke kareebi the, lekin iske baad bhi unhen mantri nahin banaaya gaya tha
 But Jaitley got the finance ministry as well as the defense ministry
 unhone likhaa tha ki pradhanmantri kaa daawa he ki unhone garibi ko kaaphi nazadik se dekha he
 His finance minister is working excessively to ensure that all Indians can see him (poverty) as closely as possible
 sinha ne kaha ki notebandi ne girti jidipi ko or kamjor karne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Taking a dig, Sinha said that PM Modi says that he has seen poverty very closely, now that the way his finance minister is working, it seems that he should show poverty to all Indians
 aaj ke samay main na hi naukari mil rahi he or na hi vikaas tej ho rahaa he, jiskaa sidhaa asar investment or jidipi par padaa he
 The way the government implemented GST also has a negative impact on the economy
 jidipi abhi 5
 7 per cent, while the government changed the way it fixed GDP in 2015
 agar puraane niyamon ke hisaab se dekha jaae to aaj jidipi 3
 7 percent

 jiesti kaa main bhi samarthan karata hum lekin ise lagu karne main sarkaar ne jaldbaaji kii
 i am the only one except the Congress finance minister who has presented the budget 7 times
 aaj desh kii janata chaahati he ki rojgaar mili, par jisase pucho vahi kah rahaa he ki rojgaar nahin mil rahaa
 Shatrughan Sinha, who came to the rescue, told Yashwant Sinha - Tested - tested wise person yashavanth ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ke samay ham log policy paralisis kii baat karte the

 Yashwant Sinha wrote that Arun Jaitley has been the biggest face in this government so far
 cabinet main naam tay hone se pehle hi unka naam tay tha ki jetali vittamantralay sanbhaalenge
 Despite losing the Lok Sabha elections, no one could stop him from becoming a minister
 sinha ne kaha ki isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main jaswant singh or pramod mahajan bhi vaajapeyi ke kareebi the, lekin iske baad bhi unhen mantri nahin banaaya gaya tha
 But Jaitley got the finance ministry as well as the defense ministry
 unhone likhaa tha ki pradhanmantri kaa daawa he ki unhone garibi ko kaaphi nazadik se dekha he
 His finance minister is working excessively to ensure that all Indians can see him (poverty) as closely as possible
 sinha ne kaha ki notebandi ne girti jidipi ko or kamjor karne main ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 Taking a dig, Sinha said that PM Modi says that he has seen poverty very closely, now that the way his finance minister is working, it seems that he should show poverty to all Indians
 aaj ke samay main na hi naukari mil rahi he or na hi vikaas tej ho rahaa he, jiskaa sidhaa asar investment or jidipi par padaa he
 The way the government implemented GST also has a negative impact on the economy
 jidipi abhi 5
 7 per cent, while the government changed the way it fixed GDP in 2015

 yashavanth sinha ne ANI se kaha ki bahut dinon se hamen pataa he ki bharat kii arthvyavastha main giravat aa rahi he
 We cannot blame the earlier government for this because we got full opportunity
 40 maheene se sarkaar main hai
 i also support GST but the government was quick to implement it
 congress ke vittamantri ko chhod den to main hi akelaa hum, jinhone 7 baar bajet pesh kiya he
 Today the people of the country want to get employment, but ask whomever is saying that they are not getting employment
 bachaav main utre shatrughna sinha ne yashavanth sinha ko bataaya- jaancha-parkhaa budhimaan vyaktitippaniyan Yashwant said that during the UPA government, we used to talk about policy paralysis
 tab lakhon karod kii pariyojnaayen rukii hui thim
 Banks had loaned millions of crores for those projects
 pariyojnaon ke latakane se bainkon kaa paisa bhi funs gaya tha
 8 lakh crores of banks are implicated
 jiesti lagu karne ke tareeqe se samasyaayein or badhin
 From 1 July it was too early to implement GST
 girti arthvyavastha main rojgaar paidaa nahin hota
 The country cannot become cashless in one stroke
 sirf kalyankari yojanaon se arthvyavastha ko gati nahin milti 
 Significantly, former finance minister Yashwant Sinha wrote an article in an English newspaper on Wednesday, targeting Arun Jaitley for the declining economy
 yashavanth sinha ne likhaa ki arun jetali abhi tak is sarkaar main sabase bada cheharaa rahe hai
 Even before the name was decided in the cabinet, his name was decided that Jaitley would take over the Finance Ministry
 loksabhaa chunaav haarane ke baavjood unhen mantri banane se koi nahin roak paaya
 Sinha said that earlier in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Jaswant Singh and Pramod Mahajan were also close to Vajpayee, but even then he was not made a minister
 lekin jetali ko vitt mantralay ke saath hi raksha mantralay bhi mila
 He wrote that the Prime Minister claims that he has seen poverty very closely
 unke vittamantri is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye zarurat se zyaada mehnat kar rahe hai ki sabhi bhartiya bhi use (garibi ko) utana hi nazadik se dekh saken
 Sinha said that demonetisation played an important role in further weakening the falling GDP
 tanj kasate hue sinha ne kaha ki piem modi kehete hai ki unhone garibi ko kaaphi kareeb se dekha he, ab jis tareeke se unke vitt mantri kaam kar rahe hai, usase aisa lagata he ki ve sabhi bharatiyon ko garibi paas se dikhaaen
 In today's time neither the job nor the growth is accelerating, which has a direct impact on investment and GDP
 sarkaar ne jiesti ko jis tarah lagu kiya uskaa bhi nakaaratmak asar arthvyavastha par padaa he
 GDP 5 now
 7 fisadi he, jabaki sarkaar ne 2015 main jidipi tay karne kaa tarika badla tha
 Today GDP 3 if seen according to the old rules
 7 fisadi he

 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par narendra modi ke naam kaa elaan kya hindustan ke musalamaanon ke liye buree khabar he, jawaab he haa
 But not because of what you might be thinking
 muslim vot bank ke bare main aam dharanaen aksar galat sabit ho jaati he
 Because in it, Muslims are seen as a group that votes for any party only on the basis of religion
 darasal musalmaan bhi hinduon kii tarah hi shashan, mahangaai, berogari or kanoon-vyavastha jaise muddon ke aadhaar par vot dete hai
 But experience says that when a community feels scared, forgets the remaining issues and votes on the basis of religion
 isaki sabase acchhee misaal to hamen musalamaanon se zyada hinduon ke vot dene ke tareeke main mil sakati he
 In the 1990s, behind the bjp's rise, Hindus believed that Muslims were made happy in the name of secularism, so Hindus should get organized
 1996 main bijepi ko record 20 fisadi vot mili the
 This figure 25 in 1998
 6 fisadi par pahunch gaya tha
 But when the anger over alleged Muslim appeasement subsided after the BJP came to power, the party's vote did not disappear
 uske baad se bijepi kaa vot 19 fisadi ke aasapaas atka hua he
 The vote of the Congress is also not fluctuating much
 pichley chaar chunaavon se uskaa vot 28 or 29 fisadi ke bich bana hua he
 But the Congress managers are worried about the next elections due to the poor functioning of the UPA
 baharhaal modi ke naam ke elaan se unamem phir se josh aa gaya he
 Now the Congress feels that if it contests on the issue of Modi, not on the basis of functioning, then its performance can be much better than expected
 yah ek sidhaa-sa ganit he
 Now whether this is true or not, a large number of Muslims do not trust Modi at all and hold him responsible for the 2002 Gujarat riots
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye unki ummidavaari hi musalamaanon main dar paidaa karne ke liye kaaphi he
 The Congress feels that this feeling of insecurity among the Muslims will give them enough votes to defeat Modi
 congress kii ranneeti is mahatvapurn vot ko hasil karne kii he
 Parliamentary elections in India are won by a very small margin
 hindi kshetra main, jahaan bahu-koniya mukaable hote hai, jeet kaa yah antar or bhi kam ho jaataa he
 Therefore, if Muslims lean a little in favor of it, then the BJP can suffer a huge loss and the Congress can benefit
 lekin in voton ko jeetne ke liye congress ko khud ko aisi party ke rup main pesh karnaa hoga, jo bharat ke musalamaanon ko suraksha de sakati he
 With this, he will also have to woo the Muslims
 yah sach he ki upie ke pichley nau saal ke shashan main berogari, ashiksha or bhedbhaav jaisi alpsankhyakon kii tamaam samasyaon ko dur karne kaa gambhirtha se prayaas nahin kiya gaya he
 Therefore, Congress can now hope to woo them only on the basis of slogans and immediate benefits
 aisa karne ke liye maulaviyon ko manaanaa, bade-bade vaade karnaa (masalan, naukariyon main aarakshan) or musalamaanon kii dharmik pahchaan ke liye maahaul bananaa shaamil hoga
 When the Congress takes this path, other secular parties will also try to woo Muslims
 masalan lalu yadav or mulaayam singh yadav kii partiyaan, jo khud ko musalamaanon kii badi himachati bataati rahi hai
 (however, after the violence in Muzaffarnagar, guess the reaction of Muslims, then their disillusionment with SP has probably started
 )narendra modi ke chunaav manager chunki jaanate hai ki unhen musalamaanon kaa zyada samarthan nahin milane vaala, isliye ve waisi hi hindu lahar paidaa karne kii koshish karenge, jisase 1998 main bijepi ko phayda mila tha
 This will increase religious tension and it is possible, violence will also increase
 ek aise samay main jab bharat ko do dashakon main sabase kathin aarthik sankat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, hamaare netaa hindu or muslim raajnneeti khel rahe honge
 Amidst all this, the real loss will be for the Muslims of India
 mukhyadhara main laane kii bajaae unhen alpsankhyak matadaata bane rahane ke liye protsaahit kiya jayega
 Instead of casting their votes on various issues like the rest of Indians, they will be forced to vote on religious grounds
 or agar hinsa bhadakti he to jaahir he alpsankhyakon ko hi sabase zyada bhugatna padegaa

 In Jannat, when the weather is changing colors in the swamps, Indian Army soldiers spend their lives in Kashmir fighting away from their families
 kashmiriyon or bhartiya sena ke sambandhon ko lekar haal hi main relies haidar film kii kaaphi prashansa or aalochana hui
 After watching the film Hyder in the mind of a former soldier after being away from the family for the sake of the country in Kashmir all the years of his life, the question arises as to which country he fought on the border for so many years
 kyonki sainik ke mutabik film main bhartiya sena kaa nakraatmak cheharaa pesh kiya gaya
 After watching the film Hyder, a former army officer has reviewed it for the Agniveer website
 yah rivyuu in dinon soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 The ex-soldier has compared the experience of his deployment days in Kashmir to the story of the film Hyder
 haidar film kii kahani 90 ke daur kii he
 The reviewing troops were also stationed in the Kashmir Valley during the 90s
 maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan:purv sainik ne website par likhaa ki maanavtaa ke itihaas main agar sabase zyada maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan kisi kaa hua he to wo bhartiya sena ke kashmir main tainaat sena ke jawan hai
 For the past few days, when ceasefire violations by Pakistan are continuously happening in the valley
 aise main ek aisi film aati he jo kashmir main logon kii raksha ke liye lard rahe sena ko villen kii tarah pesh karti he
 The person making this film is not a foreigner but an Indian
 ye baat kaaphi dukhad he
 Story of Haqiqat and Haider: Talking about the ground reality of Kashmir, Sainik wrote that Saurabh Kalia 'haider' is not as popular as Shahid Kapoor, the director and actor of the film
 kyonki saurabh ek aisi film kaa sitara nahin tha jisane rupayon kii khatir desh kii kharaab chhavi pesh karne vaali film main kaam kiya tha
 Rather, Saurabh lost his life for the sake of the country
 pakistani sena ne saurabh samet bhartiya sena ke paanch javaanon ke sharir ke tukade kar unhen jaan se maar diya tha
 Jihadi writers Basharat Pir and Vishal Bhardwaj, who wrote against India after years of struggle of the Indian Army, criticize the Indian Army by making a film
 dushman kii goli khate hai sainik:ghati main sainikon ko hone vaali pareshaani ke bare main sainik ne rivyuu main likhaa ki kashmir main tainaati ke dauraan bhartiya sena ke jawan dushman kii goli seene par khate hai
 Families living in Kashmir abuse soldiers
 film ko dekhne ke baad mere man main ye khyaal aata he ki ham kinhen bachaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 Which countrymen were we considering as our friends? Haider is an anti-national film: Ex-serviceman wrote that 'haider' is an anti-national film
 iske jariye sharmnaak tareeke se rashtravirohi film banaai gai he
 The former soldier wrote that i had lost one hand while protecting the country, on which i am proud and regretted that i could not die for the sake of the country
 haidar ne pesh kii sena kii aapraadhik chhavi:purv sainik ne likhaa, 'haidar main sena ko apradhi kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 The story of the film is written by Basharat Pir, who hates India
 pir ne bharat se hi sabakuch paaya or wo bharat ke khilaaf hi bolte rahete hai
 Pir is not a professional film writer
 lekin film kii kahani kaa plot gadhane ke liye film kii team ne pir ko chunaa
 The film gave a clear message that any person in Kashmir who helps India
 wo galat he
 In the film, Hyder's father, the doctor, helps the terrorists
 sena doctor ko giraftaar kar aantki ko maar detii he
 In such a situation, Haider moves into the film's story to avenge this
 jai hind na bolnaa galat:film main jai hind na bolne ko sahi tehraaya gaya
 In a scene in the film, when Haider's father Jai Hind does not speak, he is punished
 is seen ke baad haidar kaa pita apane bete ko badla lene ke liye sandesh dene kii baat irfan khan(ruhadaar) se karata he
 Should Jai Hind be asked to speak should be seen as revenge
 ham jaise sainikon ke liye jai hind wo shabd hai jiske liye ham jaan de bhi sakate hai or jaan le bhi sakate hai
 The story deviates: The former soldier wrote that at the end of the film Haider shows Haider going towards Pakistan
 haidar kii maa ke role main kashmiri mahila ke gande charitra ko pesh kiya jaataa he
 Hyder makes inflammatory speeches against India and the military throughout the film
 chutspa:rivyuu main sainik ne likhaa ki film main kai baar chutspa shabd kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Through which two attempts were made to fulfill
 pehla film main ise gaali kii tarah istemaal kar masala lagane kii koshish kii gai
 The second was an attempt to rhyme with Chutspa, calling AFSPA bad
 is shabd ke jariye kashmir main bharat ke adhikaar ko gaiyrkanoonee bataaya gaya
 Chutspa is a Hebrew word
 jise hutsapah (KHSUTSPAH, HUTSPAAH) pukaara jaataa he
 But Vishal mispronounces the term in the film Hyder
 purv sainik ne haidar film ke bare main kaha ki main is film par pratibandh kii maang nahin karata hum
 Because it is different from Bain's category
 yah ek bold film he
 But this film needed a bit more boldness
 jaisi boldnes pakistan sijafire ulanghan kar dikhaata he
 At the end of the review, the soldier appeals that it is better to go to the film and waste his money than to donate to the army and the PM Relief Fund after the Kashmir floods

 In an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'saamana', Thackeray said that now there is neither controversy nor bitterness
 haalanki, uddhav bijepi ke ravaiye se aahat hai
 He said that minds are broken

 BJP will put a condition, Uddhav should apologize for calling PM a chaiwala! In this editorial, Shiv Sena has also taken exit polls
 uddhav ne likhaa he ki pole kaa khel logon ko murkh banane kaa dhandha he
 How can they claim to express the thinking of entire Maharashtra based on the opinion of 2000-5000 people with exit polls? Taking a dig at the bjp's happiness on the survey, he said that those who love betting definitely feel discount
 na to vivaad chahie or na hi katutaudhav ne likhaa he, 'vaise to maharashtra prajvalit nahin hota

 Due to this, all this sweet music happened
 ab na to vivaad chahie or na hi katutaa

 It would be better for him to wait for the day of election results
 'jinhen satta priy hota he unako batta jarur lagatah shivasenaudhav thakare ne kaha, 'biryani or sharaab kii bottle par loktantr kaa bhavishya tay ho rahaa he
 The sting of democracy is played by winning the election won on the basis of bribery
 nai sarkaar aati he to nae gulli-danda se nae sire se khel rachaaya jaataa he
 Our expectation from the polling that took place on the 19th is that such a game should be stopped forever
 maharashtra ko ek drudh or vikaasshali sarkaar praapt ho
 Let the ruling Maharashtra dedicated to the public sentiments
 'shivasena pramukh ne likhaa he, 'satta bazaar kya kahata he or tumhaare ve pole vaale koun se aankade dikhaa rahe hai, is sabase zyada mahatvapurn he ki logon ne jo janadesh diya he, use pehle electronic voting mashiinon se baahar aane do
 If they stayed for the real election results, then how would they be called poll people? Talking to two-five thousand people and expressing their mandate by expressing their views is a disrespect to public sentiment

 Nitish says that there is a movement in many states of the country in support of the ban of liquor

 When Nitish Kumar was asked that home delivery of liquor is being done despite the ban of alcohol in Bihar, he admitted that this cannot be denied, but if you analyze the wider impact of the liquor ban then it would have faded

 The question is whether the judges appointed by the collegium system are still free from political interference! According to former judge Markandey Katju, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Court gave a big relief to the Modi government by rejecting the petition of former Gujarat IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt due to political pressure

 The Attorney General told the Supreme Court that there are only 7 crore PAN cards, 5 crore passports and 12-15 crore ration cards in the country, while more than 92 crore Aadhaar cards have been made, but the biggest question is that the National Judicial Appointments Commission disagrees with the order The Supreme Court judge Chelameswar has raised

 If Amit does not come to Uttar Pradesh, then the country does not know about his potential
 ” rajdhani sthit jawahar laal nehru stadium main yojit bijepi kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 18 maheene pehle 9 agast ko jab yah baat kahi thi, to sandesh saaf tha ki bataur bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ab modi ke sapanom kii bijepi kaa jariya ban chuke hai
 Shah also made a blistering start and, to cash in on the enthusiasm of the activists with the Modi wave, launched several plans for the party's Mahavistar
 maharashtra main shivasena se gathbandhan todgaye kaa faisla ho, jammu-kashmir main gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane kaa yaa phir haryana-jharkhand main apane boote bijepi ko satta main laana, shah ne party ke sapanom ko sahi myne main pankh laga die
 But now when the BJP president is to be elected, despite these successes, his path of becoming president again is not easy
 modi-shah yug main pravesh kar chuki bijepi ke liye 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kaa yah pehla bada mauka he jab sanghathanaatmak morche par aatmamanthan ho rahaa he
 The fork will be formally discussed about the future of the saffron family at a meeting of top Sangh strategists in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, on 7-8 January
 is mudde par sangh or bijepi main halchal tej ho chali he
 According to sources, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Sahasarakaryavah Krishna Gopal and the general manager of North India Bajrang Lal Gupta are not happy with the working style of Shah
 lekin sah-sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve philhal yathasthiti ke paksh main hai
 Despite inflicting full force in Bihar and Delhi, the Sangh is upset with the way the party has suffered a humiliating defeat
 bihar chunaav ke nateezon ke baad kuch saansadon ne sidhe sangh pramukh bhagwat ke aarakshan sambandhi bayaan ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 It sent a message to him that the party leadership wanted to avoid accountability, while Bhagwat's comment on reservation was in keeping with the old Sangh policy
 unki tippanee par jab vivaad hua tha tabhi bhagwat kaa saakshaatkaar lene vaale paanchajnya ke sampadak hitesh shankar ne india today se kaha tha, “sangh kabhi mausam yaa chunaav dekhakar apni baat nahin kahata
 "therefore, according to sources, on November 7, just a day before the results of the Bihar election, when the top leaders of the Sangh were sitting in Delhi, it was decided that whatever the outcome of the Bihar election, the BJP leadership should change
 
 isaki badi vajah party kaa atikendrikaran tha, jahaan shakti teen netaaon modi-shah-arun jetali (teenon gujarat se) ke bich kendrit ho chuki he
 But the second faction of the Sangh argues that if Shah is removed now, the image of Modi who emerged as a strong leader in the country and the world will be questioned
 yah bhi kaha jayega ki bihar chunaav kii haar ke baad sangh parivaar kaa modi par se vishwaas gata he isliye usne sanghathan par shikanja kas diya he
 Apart from this, the Brigade, who returned the award by accusing him of intolerance, will also get a new opportunity to attack Modi
 charchaa is baat kii bhi he ki philhal netritv parivartan ko taalte hue sangh baad main shah ko gujarat chunaav ke naam par adhyaksh pad se hataakar mukhyamantri banaakar bhej saktaa he
 Most of the Sangh's leaders, despite agreeing with this argument, want to change the current state of centralization
 haalanki in charchaaon ke bich shah ke ek bharosemand sipahasaalar kehete hai, “bihar-dilli kii chunavi haar se netritv parivartan kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Had the party lost in bjp-ruled states, Shah's re-election could have been affected
 shah iklaute party adhyaksh hai jinhen maaloom tha ki bihar main saamaajik sameekaran nitish-lalu ke paksh main he, phir bhi unhone party ko puri pratishtha daanv par lagaakar chunaav ladvaya taaki kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal kamjor na ho
 "but the Sangh's concern is about how to change the dominant person-worship and centralization of power in the BJP
 sangh ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, “sanghathan or sarkaar main is tarah ke maahaul ko dur karne kaa ek hi tarika hota he-pherbadal
 If there is to be a change in the organization, then the president and his team will have to make changes
 ” shah ke paksh main maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand, jammu-kashmir kii jeet ginai ja rahi he
 But the party's defeat in Bihar and Delhi is also being counted as an increase in the vote percentage of Shah supporters
 sawaalon main shah kii kaaryasileeloksabhaa chunaav ke baad shah ne jab bijepi kii kaman sanbhali to unka andaaj sab kuch badal dene vaala tha
 With his debut, the era of easygoing president from vajpayee-advani era to Rajnath Singh was over, it was impossible to meet Shah without a predetermined time
 unhone sanghathan kii team main apane vishwaston kii niyukti par jor diya or shuruyaat main hi maardarshak mandal banaakar adwani-joshi sareekhe bujurg netaaon ko party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha sansadeey board se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 So the lower level activists hesitated to convey their message to the high command or it became difficult to reach them
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav aate-aate kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi is kadar bad gai ki 70 siton vaali vidhansabha main pichhali baar bahumat se 4 siten kam (32) paane vaali bijepi sari takat jhonkne ke baavjood 4 siten bhi nahin laa pai
 Now? To meet the activists, Shah had to hold a program of mass democracy once a month
 party main vyaktinishta ke haaavee hone se saansad bhi kulbulane lage
 Bharat Singh, an MP from Ballia in UP, was uprooted at the party parliamentary party meeting 20 days before the completion of one year of the Modi government
 isse pehle koi saansad yaa netaa modi kii maujuudagi main kuch kehane kii himmat nahin juta paata tha
 He complained to the ministers for not responding to the letter for four months and the Centre's plan did not reach the parliamentary constituency
 Some distressed mps cheered him with applause
 bihar se saansad kirti aaazaad ne to haal hi main, shah ke manaa karne ke baavjood didisie maamle par press conference kar kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ko kathghare main khadaa kiya
 MP at the time of Bihar election
 ke
 While Singh accused of selling tickets and giving tickets to tainters, MP Shatrughan Sinha openly criticized the BJP leadership from the Prime Minister
 bihar chunaav main sthaneey netritv kii andekhi kar bahari logon ko kaman saunpane se bhi sthaneey ikai main naaraazgi paidaa hui
 And after the defeat, LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi of the guiding board along with senior leaders Shanta Kumar and Yashwant Sinha raised questions on modi-shah's working style and demanded the responsibility of fixing the defeat
 sanghathanaatmak rup se bhi shah ke faislon par sawaal uthe
 He removed Varun Gandhi from the post of general secretary but made some leaders who did not have a ground base as general secretaries
 shah se pehle tak sanghathan main mahasachivon kii saptahik baithken ho jaaya karti thim, ab padaadhikariyon kii bhi baithak kam ho gai he
 Recently, an officer also pointed this out in a conversation with Shah
 ek padaadhikari bataate hai, “beete saal 2 july ko pehle mahasachivon or dopaher main padaadhikariyon kii baithak hui thi to vahaan shah ne nae prabhariyon kii suchi, kuch nae vibhaag tay kar die, phir poocha ki kisi ko kuch kahana he to bataaen
 According to this officer, after being fixed, no one had enough courage to speak anything
 mahavistaarak kii chhavi kamajorgujrat se hi modi ke khaas ranneetikaar rahe shah kii chhavi kushal ranneetikaar kii ban chuki thi
 Shah, as UP in-charge, proved his strategy skills in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone chunaav ke dauraan pradesh ke ek netaa se yahaan tak kaha tha ki soobe se ek bhi musalmaan chunaav jitkar nahin jayega
 This was not a prediction, but a result of his solid strategy, in which he created a ripple in UP
 lekin bihar or dilli ke chunaavon ne unki chhavi ko palitha laga diya
 However, the increase in vote percentage was described as his achievement
 haalanki party main unke khilaaf yah daleel di jane lagi he ki bahukoniya mukaable main shah ne jeet dilaai lekin jin rajyon main sidhaa muqabla hua, vahaan unka micromanagement dharashayi ho gaya
 After becoming the president, when Shah targeted to increase the number of BJP members to 100 million, he adopted the missed call technique, disregarding the traditional method
 par lakshya paar karne kaa daawa kiya to aankadon par ungali uthne lagi
 He then laid out the blueprint for the mass contact campaign, in which the initiative to reach all the members and make them member-to-worker began
 lekin sadsyta abhiyaan main tab tak kai gadbaditaan paith chuki thim
 For example, out of 11 crore missed calls, the data of about 4 crore people was not available to the party
 party ne satta main hone kaa phayda uthaate hue mobile companiyon se gaiyr-aadhikarik taur par data maange
 Companies are also just 1
 20 karod kaa hi aankada de pain
 Professionals were also employed in this work, but somewhere the name-address was wrong and the PIN code was missing somewhere
 pradeshon kaa aankada bhi kuch jagahon par mix ho gaya tha
 Even a fortnight after the deadline of the mass campaign ended on July 31, 2015, the party was able to contact only about 40 lakh members, who were not even 4%
 party netaa kehete hai ki takneekee khaamiyon ke chalate aisa hua, mahasampark main jamaa form kii sankhya isse kahin zyada he
 But if sources are to be believed, the party has stopped this campaign as impractical
 sanghathan chunaav kii hadabadi main shah ne mahasampark abhiyaan ke bich main hi mahaprashikshan abhiyaan shuru kar diya or 15 lakh sakriy sadasyon ko prashikshit karne kaa faisla kiya
 It was to be completed only in October last but two months after that it is still in balance
 mahaprashikshan abhiyaan ke prabharee pi
 Muralidhar Rao says, “the people of Jharkhand were also involved in the Bihar elections
 kerala or gujarat main bhi sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav the
 So training could not be done in these states
 sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii prakriya bhi deree kii ek vajah he
 In other states, there have been sections up to the mandal level and in some states to the district level
 hamane teen maheene kaa samay or badhaayaa he
 Now it will be completed by march-april
 rashtriya str par bhi 6-7 varg yojit kiye jaaenge
 According to sources, now 10 lakh workers will be trained in this campaign
 pehle yah lakshya 15 lakh kaa tha
 According to a BJP leader, there are only 10 lakh party officials from top to bottom
 prashikshan abhiyaan ke sanyojak mahesh sharma sweekaar karte hai ki apekshit lakshya nahin mila he
 Nevertheless, “despite so many electoral activities, it is a big thing to give such priority to the work of the organization
 apekshit lakshya praapt nahin hue lekin bahut acha kaam hua he
 Apart from these arguments, the question arises that when the plans for organization expansion were being made, there was no idea of the upcoming elections? Why was there such a panic? According to sources, when Shah started the General Training Campaign in the midst of the General Public Relations Campaign, some officials said that it was an obstacle in the General Campaign Campaign
 lekin shah ne sanghathan chunaav karaane kii baat kahkar daleelon ko khaarij kar diya
 Result: His image of the generalist began to be questioned
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, “ab chunauti bad gai he
 Earlier a member was disturbed, then it was easy to reach him through the active member
 ab missd kol vaale sadsy tak party kaise pahonchegi?”pradhanmantri modi ne apni sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone par khud saansadon-vidhayakon ko saamaajik suraksha yojana ko desh bhar main pahunchane kaa lakshya diya tha
 Under this, at least 11,000 people were to be given this plan in every assembly, but due to the disinterest of mps, this goal could not be realized
 uttar pradesh main party ne ise har vidhansabha kii jagah sansadeey kshetra ke hisaab se 11,000 tay kiya
 In addition to this, Shah started 8 important projects like Namami Gange, Swachhta Abhiyan, "beti Bachao, Beti Padhao", office construction, office modernization for which separate committees were also formed, but most of the plans are limited to meetings only
 shah bane to kisi hogi bijepitamam avarodhon ke baavjood amit shah agar adhyaksh banane main safal rahe, jisaki sambhaavna zyada he, to unhen sangh parivaar kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke thos prayaas karne honge
 Sangh's interference will also increase from team formation to other activities
 tathy yah he ki shah ne party main darbari samskruti khatm kii or pravaas par focus kiya
 Insisting on simplicity, stop using private aircraft and instructed not to stay in luxurious hotels
 par unke dobaaraa adhyaksh banane par, party main punap rahi gutbaji ko rokna or varishton ke saath sangh parivaar se samanvay sadhana unki badi chunauti hogi
 By the way, after the defeat in Bihar, he has started an exercise to change his image
 kendriya netritv main samoochee shakti samahit karne kii ranneeti ko badalte hue unhone assam main sthaneey netritv ko aage badhaayaa he, jabaki ab tak party modi ke naam par hi kismat aajamaati rahi he
 He has given the command of the State President and Election Campaign Committee to Sarbananda Sonowal in Assam
 sanghathanaatmak chunaavon main bhi shah ne rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh jaise rajyon main mukhyamantriyon kii pasand ke hi pradesh adhyaksh banane die
 He had a different opinion before the Bihar election results
 vaise, kaaryastylee main is badlaav par bhi sawaal uth rahe haih ab tak kii jeet kaa shrey modi-shah ko mila kyonki vahaan koi sthaneey cheharaa saamne nahin tha
 In such a situation, if the party performs well in Assam, the credit will go to the local leadership
 sangh agar shah ko bila shart adhyaksh banane par raji hota he to saaf ho jayega ki aglaa loksabhaa chunaav modi-shah kii saraparasti main hi ladaa jayega
 It will be a setback for the anti-modi camp that is hoping that the organization be brought parallel to the government
 
 
 
 If Shah is not formed, the election of a new national president for BJP is very important for the future of the party
 aise main vah sangh par kaaphi kuch nirbhar he
 If the Sangh carries out the strategy of making a heavyweight president, then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari may be the choice
 par aise main pradhanmantri modi kii saakh par sawaal uthegaa kyonki sanghathan par unki pakad kamjor hogi
 Under Shah, he is able to carry out all his plans in the organization effortlessly
 shah ke adhyaksh na rahane par sanghathan ek baar phir puraane dharre par laut saktaa he
 New equations will emerge in organization and government
 abhi modi-jetali-shah kii tikdi bijepi or sarkaar donon par pakad banaae hue he
 While the bitterness of Modi's relationship with Rajnath Singh is well known, it is also a fact that there was no telephone conversation with Modi while Gadkari was president
 unheen ke samay bijepi ke purv sanghathan mantri sanjay joshi ko party main ahm jimmedaari di gai thi or modi ne ise ahan kaa sawaal banaate hue mumbai kii kaaryakarini kaa bahishkaar kar diya tha
 Eventually, Joshi had to resign from the executive
 joshi se modi kii adaavat gujarat se hi he
 Last year, the party took action even after some activists put up posters of congratulations on Joshi's birthday
 halaat badalane par joshi kii vaapasi ho sakati he
 However, according to sources, the Sangh is still brainstorming that Modi should not be affected in the election of national president
 sangh ke liye imtahaan kii ghadibijepi main jis tarah shakti kaa kendrikaran hua he, usase sangh chintit he
 He realizes that it is not possible for the organization to run independently under Shah
 saamanyatya sangh bijepi par haaavee hota rahaa he, lekin jis tarah sarkaar or sanghathan main vyakti puja badi he, usase aane vaale samay main yah sthiti palat sakati he
 Shah had hinted at the party by showing his active involvement in building his own team
 aise main 23 janvari se pehle hone vaale sanghathan chunaav main nirnay se pehle sangh ko apni sthiti tay kerani hogi ki vah rajnatik sanchaalak kii bhoomika banaae rakhana chahta he yaa phir badale hue daur main “naitik” maardarshak tak hi simatana chahega
 Certainly, the Sangh applies a master stroke in the election of the BJP president
 ab use hi tay karnaa he ki vah kuch sharton ke saath shah kii tajposhi ko hari jhandi dikhayega yaa phir sanghathan main badlaav kar shinkaja kasega

 Campaign: On the lines of the central government's Namami Gange project, Amit Shah formed a separate committee of Namami Gange, which included two Union ministers Prakash Javadekar, Uma Bharti, Rajneesh Kumar, co-organization ministers Shivprakash and Hridaynath Singh along with National Secretary Trivendra Singh Rawat
 
 is team kii maheene main ek baithak ho jaati he
 Amit Shah himself has also attended two meetings

 Result: The party's special journey for awareness from Gomukh to Gangasagar was to begin in October

 This trip has not been done yet and the next date has not been decided

 But in the initial stages, the meetings of this team could not be held due to the absence of important members like Sitharaman
 disambar ke madhya main do baithken huin, jise party upaadhyaksh vinay sahasrabuddhe ne sanchalit kiya
 Result: The Modi government has about two years to go, but at the organization level, the structure has not been able to make this campaign successful
 sabhi rajyon se ek brands ambesder, dharmik santon-kathakaron ke naam, 5 enjio or jile se 5 pramukh logon ke naam maange gaye hai
 The party wants to form a movement by preparing it as a separate branch at the national level
 lekin shah apane pehle kaarykaal main ise puraa nahin kar paae hai
 Question: Why the party has not been able to create a complete structure of this campaign at the national level so far? 6 Office Construction Committee: Committee was formed on April 4, 2015
 abhiyaanhis cameti main maangeram garg, kendriya mantri piyush goyal, sah sanghathan mantri saudaan singh, rakesh kumaar jain, baldev raaj sharma ko jimmedaari di gai
 Amit Shah aimed to build bjp's own grand office in every district of the country
 lekin nirmaan kaary se judaa mudda hone kii vajah se is kaam main raftaar dikhi or lagaataar meeting kii vajah se desh bhar main jila str par jameen chinhit karne kaa kaam shuru ho gaya
 The result: Election bottlenecks may have been created in other campaigns, but there was no such thing in this work
 akele uttar pradesh main 75 jilon main se 40 jilon main jagah chinhit ho chuki hai or 2016 main us par nirmaan shuru ho jayega
 Question: When the election in the rest of the campaign created a bottleneck, what is the point of getting quick in the direction of office construction? 7 Office Modernization Time: On April 4, 2015, a committee was formed

 On the other hand, BJP also strongly condemned this behavior of DM

 The state whose chief minister talks of breaking caste
 us rajya kaa dm agar is tarah kii baat karata he, to ye ek chintajanak baat he
 Not only this, DM Sahab said that according to the population of Kanu society in Bihar, there is no representation in the Vidhan Sabha
 itnaa hi nahin dm sahab ne ek kadam or aage badhaate hue kaha ki agar apni jati ke vyakti se dushmani bhi ho, tab bhi vot use hi dena chahie

 At the same time, he has also advocated to create a fund to help the students of Swatrajya
 12 saal pehle aaj hi ke din sansad par aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 On that day, five terrorists in a white ambassador's car had shaken the entire Hindustan by pillaging the largest temple of democracy in 45 minutes
 aapako bataate hai sansad par hamale kii puri kahani:13 disambar, 2001subah 11 bajkar 28 minutesansad bhawan, dillisansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kii sargharmiyaan tej thim
 The proceedings of both the houses had been adjourned for 40 minutes following a fierce uproar by the opposition
 sadan sthagit hote hi pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or vipaksh kii netaa sonia gandhi loksabhaa se nikal kar apane-apane sarkari nivas ke liye kooch kar chake the
 Many mps had also left
 par grih mantri laalkrishna adwani apane kai saathi mantriyon or lagbhag 200 saansadon ke saath ab bhi loksabhaa main hi maujuud the
 As usual, there was a whole media gathering inside the Lok Sabha premises, by then many mps and Ministers had also come out from inside the House and were enjoying the warm sun
 subah ke 11 bajkar 29 minutesansad bhawan kaa get number 11uparashtrapati krishnakanth sharma ke car ke kafile main tainaat suraksharmi ab sadan se unke baahar aane kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 And at that very moment, a white ambassador car accelerates towards the vice presidential convoy
 sansad bhawan ke andar aane vaali gadiyon kii tay raftaar se isaki raftaar kahin zyada tej thi
 One could only understand that Jagdish Yadav, a Lok Sabha security worker, was seen running behind the car
 wo lagaataar car ko rukne kaa ishaara kar rahe the
 Seeing Jagdish Yadav running wildly, Vice President's security guards ASI Jeet Ram, ASI Nanak Chand and ASI Shyam Singh also sneak towards him in an attempt to stop the ambassador car
 surakshakarmiyon ko apni ore aata dekh ambesder car kaa driver apni gaadi ko get number ek kii taraf mode detaa he
 The vice-president's car was parked near gate number one
 tej raftaar or mode kii vajah se car kaa driver niyantran kho detaa he or gaadi sidhe uparashtrapati kii car se ja takaraati he
 At 11:30 in the morning, No
1, Parliament House, now someone could understand that only when the four doors of the ambassador open simultaneously and the five fidayine sitting in the car go out in a blink of an eye and start firing indiscriminately
 paanchon eke-47 se las the
 The five had bags on their back and shoulders
 pehali baar aatank loktantr kii dahalij paar kar chukaa tha
 The entire Parliament building was echoed by a flurry of bullets, four security personnel who were trying to stop the ambassador car became the victims of the first attack of terrorists
 par sansad bhawan main maujuud baaki logon ko abhi bhi pataa nahin tha ki kya hua yaa kya ho rahaa he
 Most of the people were thinking of the sound of gunfire
 kisi ne vahamo-gumaan main bhi nahin so tha ki sansad bhawan ke andar bhi aatankwaadi ghus sakate hai
 But then only then comes a blast sounding in the midst of gunfire
 goliyon kii gunj ke baad pehla dhamaakaa ye elaan kar chukaa tha ki duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke mandir yani sansad bhawan par hamalaa ho chukaa he
 Amidst the clamor of the gunfire and the blast of the blasts, the picture was clear in a moment after seeing the security personnel falling on the bloodied ground
 or ab sansad bhawan ke andar chaaron taraf afra-tafari or dehshat kaa maahaul tha
 Whichever corner was visible, he was running away
 ab bhi goliyon kii aawaaj sabase zyada get number 11 kii taraf se hi aa rahi thi
 The five terrorists were still showering bullets and grenades from around the ambassador's car
 tabhi aatankwaadiyon ko get number 11 kii taraf jamaa dekh sansad bhawan ke suraksha karmidelli police or siarpief ke javaanon ke saath get number 11 kii taraf badhate hai
 Now firing had started from both sides
 golibari se mahaj kuch sau meter kii duuri par maujuud grahamantri laalkrishna adwani ko bhi tab tak hamale kii khabar mil chuki thi
 Therefore, all senior ministers including LK Advani and Defense Minister George Fernandez were immediately taken to safe places inside the house
 iske saath hi sadan ke andar jane vaale tamaam daravaaje bhi band kar die jate hai or vahaan surakshakarmiapani-apni pojishan le lete hai
 On the other hand, seeing the security personnel moving towards gate number 11, the five terrorists also start changing their positions
 paanch main se ek aatanvaadi goliyaan chalaata hua ab get number 1 kii taraf bhaagta he
 While the remaining four try to move towards gate number 12
 aatankwaadiyon kii koshish kisi tarah sadan ke daravaaje tak pahunchane kii thi taaki wo sadan ke andar ghus saken
 But the security personnel had already taken their positions around all the doors
 iske alaava aatankwaadi jis tarah goliyaan barasaate hue idha-udhi bhaag rahe the usase saaf lag rahaa tha ki ve andar to ghus aae hai par unhen ye pataa nahin he ki sadan ke andar daakhil hone ke liye daravaaje kis taraf hai?isi afra-tafari ke bich ek aatankwaadi jo get number 1 kii taraf badha tha vahiin se goliyaan barsaata hua sadan ke andar jane ke liye sansad bhawan ke galiyare se hote hue ek daravaaje kii taraf badhata he
 But before he succeeds in his attempt, he is shot by security forces
 goli lagate hi get number ek ke kareeb galiyare main hi daravaaje se kuch dur wo gir padataa he
 The first terrorist had fallen
 par abhi wo jinda tha
 The security personnel were still avoiding getting close to him despite taking him completely under target
 kyonki dar ye tha ki kahin wo khud ko uda na ne
 And this fear of security personnel was not wrong either
 kyonki jameen par girane ke kuch hi pal baad jab us aatankwaadi ko laga ki ab wo ghir chukaa he to usne fouran remote dabaa kar khud ko uda liya
 He tied a bomb to his body
 chaar aatanki ab bhi jinda the
 Not only were they alive, but were constantly running away indiscriminately
 aisa lagata tha maano ve ghanton muqabla karne kii taiyaari ke saath aae the
 Because they had a full range of bullets, bombs and grenades
 jo wo apane sharir main chupa kar or kandhe par tange bag main lekar aae the
 Till now the attack had already been reported to NSG commandos and army
 aatankwaadiyon se nipatane main maahir dilli police kii special cell kii team bhi sansad bhawan ke liye kooch kar chuki thi
 But the live operation in the Parliament House was still going on
 news channel ke jariye hamale kii khabar ab desh-videsh tak fail chuki thi
 Meanwhile, perhaps the remaining four terrorists had also reported the death of one of their companions
 shaayad ye khabar unhen us dhamaake se mili thi jo remote ke jariye ek aatankwaadi ne khud ko uda kar kiya tha
 So the rest of the terrorists became more nervous now
 ghabrahat main ab chaaron aatankwaadi idhar-udhar bhaagate hue chupane kaa thikaana dhundne lage
 On the other hand, the security personnel had now started surrounding the terrorists from all four sides
 golibari ab bhi jari thi
 And then in the meantime another good news came from gate number five
 ek or aatankwaadi surakshakarmi kii goliyon se dher ho chukaa tha
 Now three terrorists left
 un teenon ko acchhee tarah pataa tha ki wo sansad bhawan se zindaa batch kar nahin nikal sakate
 So he also made one last attempt to go inside the house
 ve goliyaan barasaate hue dhire-dhire get number 9 kii taraf badhane lage
 But the security personnel surrounded him near gate number nine
 din ke kareeb 12
 At 10 o'clock, Gate No
 9, Parliament House, now the entire operation was confined near Gate No
 9
 donon taraf se lagaataar goliyaan chal rahi thim
 In between, terrorists were also throwing grenades on security personnel
 par chunki ve chaaron taraf se ghir chuke the lihaaja ab bachane kaa koi rasta nahin tha
 And finally after a while, all the three terrorists were piled up

 ) Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar's film 'rustom' has been released
 pesh he unase hui khaas baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:'rustam' kaa kirdaar nibhaana mushkil tha?nahin, mere liye mushkil nahin tha kyonki mujhe to bas kirdaar nibhaana tha
 The writer always faces difficulty in writing the character
 film kise zyada pasand aegi?ye film auraton ko zyada pasand aegi
 The script is quite different, first a woman cheats in a relationship and then tries to back low
 dekhiegaa ye film kai saare divorce ko bhi roak paane main sakasham rahegi
 You are doing more patriotic films nowadays, don't you think Manoj Kumarato? See Manoj Kumar Sahab has done many great films
 aise insaan se meri tulana kiya janaa galat rahegaa
 i don't think Manoj Kumar Sahab did films like 'housefull 3' and 'dhishoom', so it is not right to compare with him
 maine bahut sari alag-alag tarah kii filmein kii hai or main nahin chahta ki mujhe koi ek hi tarah kii filmon ke liye 'tag' kare
 Your 'dhishoom' character has been well received
 ji mujhe lagata he ki samaaj ke log ab har tarah ke role ko sweekaar kar rahe hai
 If more such rolls continue, i will definitely do so
 arshad ke baad ab aap 'jolly elelbi' kar rahe hai?ji dekhie aisa hota he ki kai baar kisi or ko bhi mauka miltaa he
 The sequel to my 'welcome' film was done by someone else
 kisi bhi role par kisi kaa janmasiddh adhikaar nahin hota, jaise 'hera pheri' kii agali film meri jagah koi or kar rahaa he
 So it keeps happening
 main apane hisaab se us kirdaar ko nibhaataa hum
 Is there anything in the industry? No, i am happy that i am a part of this industry
 mujhe koi malaal nahin he, koi bhi mere jaisaa kariyar chahega
 If i keep a grudge, then i will not be a bad person because there is no possibility of malaise in whatever God has given me
 khud ke bheetar kii koi aisi baat, jis par aapako kaam karnaa he?abhi to mujhe bahut sari acting kerani he, apni aawaaj par kaaphi kaam karnaa he
 Is Rustom inspired by the 'nanavati case'? No, it is based on 4 different real-life incidents
 aapaki filmon kaa bijness 300-400 karod kaa kyon nahin hota?kyonki main saal main 4 filmein karata hum
 What would you say about the comment made on Naseeruddin Shah's 'rajesh Khanna'? i have been in the industry for 25 years and believe that those whose glass houses do not throw stones at the houses of others
 kisi bade vidwaan ne kaha he ki apane bijness se matlab rakhana chahie
 Who am i to comment on anyone
 sabaki apni-apni raay hoti he
 They can speak their mind
 lekin ab wo baat khatm ho chuki he
 Naseer Saheb has also apologized
 main nahin chahta ki ab us baat ko zyada tool diya jaae
 How do you see the losses and gains in the film? Our film is made in 26 crores and the money is spent in promotion
 ab jo bhi kamai hogi wo produsar ke taur par meri hogi
 If the film will run then i will get it and if it runs short, i will get less
 magar flop nahin hogi, bas yahi soch rakhata hum, yahi kaaran he saal main 3-4 filmein karata hum
 What kind of film is yet to be done? i did the horror comedy film 'bhool Bhoolaiya'
 abhi or bhi aisi horer kamedi filmein karnaa chaahunga kyonki aisi filmein kam banati hai or sirf mahmud saab hi aisi filmon ke maahir the
 There are such big stars, still connected to the ground? i had flopped 14 films too, but success and failure teaches me to connect with the ground

 According to sources in Pakistan, Islamabad wants a meaningful dialogue on the issue as public opinion in their country differs on the issue

 pakistan ke sutron ke anusaar, islamabad chahta he ki is masale par ve ek sarthak baatcheet chaahate hai kyonki unke desh main logon kii raay is masale par alag-alag he
 This reaction of Pakistan is the latest evidence that the negotiation between PM Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Ufa, Russia last month is hindering the path of this dialogue
