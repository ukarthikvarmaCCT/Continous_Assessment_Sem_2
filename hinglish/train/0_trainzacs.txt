 26 july ko dopaher ke baad lag rahaa tha kuch bada hone vaala he, barish ruk nahin rahi thi, shaam hote-hote sthiti bighad gai, tay ho gaya tha ki raat daftar main bitaani padegi
 Not only this, you will also have to work overnight
 raat ko nariman point se mumbai ke upnagaron ke paas jane kii kaaphi koshish kii, lekin safal nahin ho paaya
 The water blocked all the roads
 vahaan upnagar main sthit hamaare duusare daftar main bijli chali gai thi or sampark tham gaya tha
 Reporting of areas filled with water was going on as far as possible throughout the night
 lag rahaa tha subah tak thik ho jayega
 In the morning, i received a call from an officer of the metropolitan municipality that he was going to share help with the helicopter, i asked, is the situation so bad? He said it looks like pahunche to kaha ki reporter or cameraman aaenge to madad kaa saamaan utaarna padegaa
 Then it was decided that only the cameraman would go
 jab dedh ghante ke baad ve laute to, jo tasviren dekhi yakeen karnaa mushkil tha
 In Mumbai, the filling of rain water is familiar to the child, but here, just as there was no difference between Mumbai and Arabian Sea, it was known that it is not a disaster to end in a few hours
 vikaas ke naam par mumbai ke saath jo khilwaad hua he uskaa fal mumbai bhugat rahi thi
 On July 26, immediately after the water leakage, the then Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh immediately held a press conference and said that there was 966 mm of rain in Mumbai and there was no control of the government
 bina kisi yojana ke hue consatructionunase jabpucha gayaaki control is baat par to ho saktaa tha ki itani haani to naa ho, logon ko jald se jald madad to pahunchni chahie thi, aakhirkaar 400 logon ko jaan ganvaani padi? unhone mana ki mumbai main dizaster management kii kami he, saath hi gaiyrkanoonee or bina kisi yojana ke hue consatruction ne mumbai kii ye haalat bana di he
 The maximum damage was done in the areas around Mithi River (named river)
 uske aas-paas hue nirmaan ne barish kaa pani samandar main le jane vaali is nadi kaa galaa ghont diya gaya tha
 Because of which water entered the surrounding areas
 banaaya gaya dizaster management celsarkaar ne faisla liya or dobaaraa aisa naa ho iske liye upaay karne kii thaan lee
 At least announced
 mukhya rup se tay hua ki aapadaa prabandhan kaa ection plan banaaya jaae
 The storm water drain of Mumbai means drains connecting the rain water to the sea
 mithi nadi ko gaharaa or chaudaa banane ke liye nishchit samaysima ke saath plan banaaya jaae
 After this, Disaster Management Cell was formed in Mumbai Municipal Corporation till 2007
 lekin baaki projects kii haalat dekhen to lagata he ki mumbai ab bhi 26 july 2005 jaisi barish kaa shikaar ho sakati he
 In the hope of completion of the project, Mumbai now see the Bremstravot project, in fact, in view of the growing population and size of Mumbai, there was talk of starting this project in 1993, but it had to be started on 26 July 2005
 is project ke tahat mumbai ke naalon ko chaudaa or gaharaa bananaa tha, mumbai main 8 pumping stesan banane the, taaki pani ko pump karke samandar main choda ja sake, kul 58 ahm infrastracchar project banane the
 All this work was supposed to be finished in 2011, but till now only half the work has been completed and the project will be finished in 2016
 Nobody is saying that this chest will be completed in 2016
 mithi nadi ke project kaa bhi yahi haal he, nai sarkaar aane ke pehle tak bijepi ke maujuuda saansad kirit saumaiyya har saal june maheene main patrakaron ko mithi nadi kaa boat main safar kara kar mithi project kaa adhuraa kaam dikhaate the ab to wo bhi ruk gaya he
 Flood Risk in Mumbai Recently, the report of the Government Panel for Climate Change ie IPCC has stated that out of 50 cities around the world, Mumbai has been declared as the second largest flood prone city
 is report ke mutabik mumbai ke 28 lakh logon par samudri baadh kaa khatra bana hua he or agar kuch nahin kiya gaya, to 2070 tak ye sankhya 1 karod tak pahunch jaaegi
 That is, the situation is serious and if the government is taking some steps then it is insufficient
 sarkaar kaa lachar ravaiya jimmedaarmumbai kaa flud protection cover yani baadh kaa khatra rokane kaa sabase naiysargik kavach mangrowj bhi dhire-dhire hat rahaa he or iske liye sarkaar kaa lachar ravaiya jimmedaar he
 The cover of about 5000 hectares of mangroves is being removed along the edges of Mumbai
 is maamle par jab bombai hoicourt main janhit yachika daayar hui, tab adaalat ne mumbai mangrowj cell ko mangrowj kii sthiti par report banane ko kaha
 According to this report, many mangroves have been removed and temples, roads, huts and even pucca buildings have been built there
 kai jagahon par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se malba lad kar mangrowj ko hataaya gaya
 Experts say that no consideration has been given to the construction plan of floodplain which does not contain flood water in Mumbai's development plan
 phir ho sakati he tabahichennai main ek hi din kareeb 350 mem tak barish hone kii vajah se itani tabaahi hui he, mumbai main ab bhi agar ek ghante main 100 mem tak barish hoti he to mahanagar palika or prashasan ke tote ud jate hai
 Recently, on 19 June 2015, Mumbai was closed by 280 mm of rain
 matlab saaf he ki mumbai keval ek duubataa shahar banakar rah gaya he or agar fouran jaruri kadam nahin uthaae gaye to 26 july 2005 ke halaat dohraane ke asaar bane hue hai

 This time, Navratri Festival is on their target
 ye mahotsav adhiktar gujarati samudaay ke log manaate hai
 The MNS has warned all the organizers of the Navratri festival to pay according to commercial rates if they organize such events at the bmc's place
 saath hi aise aayojanon se hone vaale munaafe kaa aadha hissaa biemasi ko den
 'BMC should take half the money for Dandiya events', says that the way the BMC charges fees for organizing and promoting Ganapati festivals from Ganesh mandals, the same should be taken from the Navratri organizers
 party ke parshad sandip deshpandey ne is sambandh main biemasi pramukh ko chitthee likhi he
 It demands that BMC should claim at least 50 per cent of its earnings from commercial events such as Kodandia
 chitthee main kaha gaya he ki navaratri aayojakon mahangi tikaton, vigyapanon or praayojakon se moti kamai karte hai
 This time Navratri is to be held from 1 October to 10 October
 mumbai main har saal garba or dandiya ke liye 500 se zyada stall lagaae jate hai
 These events are mostly held on BMC land
 navaratri mahotsavon ke aayojakon main adhiktar gujarati samudaay ke hi log hai
 'rules should be one for all' Deshpande wrote in his letter, 'if the BMC takes money from Ganesh mandals then why the exemption to Dandiya organizers? They use the city space, earn but give only nominal money to BMC
 biemasi ko apana jaij rajasav nahin chhodana chahie
 BMC should also charge fees for advertising and banners from such organizers
 ' haalanki chitthee main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki emenes navaratri mahotsav ke aayojan ke khilaaf nahin he
 Marathi people also participate in it
 lekin niyam sab ke liye ek hone chahie
 The issue is being politicized - BJP though BJP, Shiv Sena partner in power in BMC, has expressed a different opinion
 biemasi se jude bijepi netaa manoj kotak ne kaha, 'biemasi durga puja or navaratri ke liye jameen detii he
 MNS should not adopt a divisive attitude towards festivals

 To fulfill this objective, Garrison is demanding to make Uttarakhand the capital

 bajet kii tangi or isse jude raajnneetik uddeshyon ke bich santulan saadhane ke liye sarkaar ko apni nitiyon main badlaav karne ko vivash hona padaa he
 In order to motivate the general class students who have passed class X, the 'padhe beti-badhe Beti' scheme has been discontinued
 vahiin, ab chaatraon se judi do anya yojanaon 'kanya vidyadhan' or 'hamaari beti, uskaa kal' par hi sarkaar ne dhyaan lagaaya he
 Though the funds of these schemes have been reduced by ten thousand rupees in view of the financial condition of the government treasury, but the government argues that this change has been done with the aim of benefiting more and more students
 darasal, sarkaar ke saamne bajet kii kami ke alaava aagaamee aam chunaav kii bhi chintaa bhi he
 By increasing the amount of funds, the government has decided to increase the number of beneficiaries in both the schemes, to further its political campaign

 agar aap saahitiyik patrika hans ke dariyaganj sthit daftar main rajendra yadav ke kamare main jaaen, to aapako unki kursi khaali padi najar aegi
 It has been nearly a year and a half since his death
 daftar main koi shakchas ab bhi unki kursi par nahin baithta
 His picture hangs on the wall just above it
 lekin unka paryaay ban chuke hans kii nirbaadh yatra par koi viraam nahin laga he
 In the same office a letter from a well-wisher for the May 2015 issue of the magazine, "the mind had died after Rajendra had left
 sochaa, jaise sarika or dharmayug jaisi pratishthit patrikaayen band ho gayi, vaise hi hans bhi band ho jayega
 But when i read the recent issue of Hans, she was satisfied that she is leaving like that
 rajendra ji jo saikadon nae lekhak bana gaye the, ve usko kaise marane denge
 Apparently after the death of Rajendra Yadav, his daughter Rachna Yadav took over the management of the magazine and the editing work is being looked after by Sanjay Sahai
 sahay bataate hai, “dar tha ki rajendra ji ke baad hans ke saamne achaanak aarthik sankat na aa jaae
 But Rachna is managing everything professionally
 ” asal main hans main rajendra yadav jaisaa tej or pratishtha ab bhale hi nahin najar aa rahi ho par uski yatra badastoor jari he

 ab patrika ne ek nayaa prayog kiya he
 It has started a new column titled Intruder, in which stories of youth living in slums are being preferred
 isamen ek rikhshachaalak kii kahani ko jagah mili he
 Obviously, in the literary circles of Hindi, no one could have imagined this before
 isi tarah paakhi ne apane april, 2015 ke ank main lokapriy lekhak surendra mohan pathak kaa saakshaatkaar prakashit kiya he, jinhen kal tak hindi kii saahitiyik birdari lugdi sahityakar kah kar khaarij karti rahi he
 In this issue, litterateurs' discussion on popular literature and serious literature is presented
 jaahir he, ye laghu patrikaayen na sirf nae prayog kar rahi hai balki nae vimarshon kii ore unmukh hai jisamen vartmaan samay kii nabj kii padtaal he
 In this episode, Wagarth discussed the poem of the last fifty years in five digits from October 2014 to February 2015, which was discussed
 isamen muktibodh kii mrityu se lekar ab tak kii yani 1964 se 2014 tak kii hindi kavita kii padtaal he ki is dauraan kavitaayen kisi raheen or muktibodh ne jin mulyon ko jagah di, kya unhen swar mil paa rahaa he? isi tarah hans or pahal ke haalia ankon main karmendu shishir ne urdu or muslim navajagaran ke bare main vistaar se charchaa kii he
 This side has been neglected so far
 in patrikaon main sahitya se itar samasamyik vishyon par bhi vimarsh shaamil he
 For example, in the January 2015 issue of the initiative, Jitendra Bhatia explores the plight of farmers, from their suicides to the GM crop, titled twenty-first Century Battles, while Global Enlightenment in New Enlightenment and discussions focused on issues such as disaster, ethics and concerns
 Raises many questions
 ullikhit patrikaon kii ek or khubi yah he ki inamen videshi sahitya pramukhataa se jagah ghere hue he
 For example, while the March 2015 issue of Kathadeesh focuses on afro-american female writing, the May 2015 issue of Naya Jnanodaya focuses on stories and poems from Afghanistan, Pakistan to neighboring countries such as Myanmar and the Maldives
 isi tarah pahal ke march 2015 ke ank main america ke mashhoor kavi or nibandhkaar david mason kii paanch kavitaayen prakashit hai
 In the initiative, the best works have been published from French and German to Bangla, Punjabi and Marathi and other Indian languages
 iske naam ek or uplabdhi jud gai he ki germany kii tiubinaje uniwarsity ne is patrika ko digitise kiya he or iske sabhi 99 ankon kaa german main anuwaad ho chukaa he
 Bahujan Udhaar Meanwhile, Sanjeev Chandan, editor of Streekaal, a magazine focused on women's discourse, draws attention to another rise, "the scope of writing for dalit-adivasi-backward communities in literary magazines has increased
 ” kuch patrikaayen to mukhya taur par inhen par kendrit hai
 For example, the Forward Press has brought out the Bahujan literature annuity issue and introduced Bahujan approach to criticism ranging from OBC literature to discussion
 isane bahujan kendrit saanskrithik vimarsh sthapit kiya he or in samudaayon kii aawaaj ko jagah di he
 Similarly, Professor Ganga Sahai Meena in JNU has started a tribal literature magazine, saying the absence of tribals in Hindi literature
 sahyog se srujanalekin in patrikaon ke saamne sabase bada sankat aarthik hi he
 Except magazines like Naya Gyanodaya, Wagarth and Pakhi, almost all magazines run with community support
 vagarth ko bhartiya bhashaa trust nikaalata he, nayaa gyanoday ko bhartiya gyanpith to paakhi ko independent media inishiative socity nikaalati he
 The editors of several journals reported that they are two to four from the economic crisis
 pariktha ke sampadak shankar bataate hai, “sarkaar saahitiyik patrikaon ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 The Government of Delhi has given several journals under the name srishna-smritan Rs 30,000
 kaa vigyaapan dene kaa silsilaa shuru kiya tha
 Now that too is closed
 ” sanjay sahay centre kii nai sarkaar kii niti kii ore sanket karte hai, “agar aap satta virdohi likhte hai to vah riect karti he
 We used to get Doordarshan's advertisement which has been discontinued last year
 ” vahiin gyanaranjan kehete hai, “ham kisi bhi rajnatik party yaa uski sarkaar ke vigyaapan nahin lete
 The journey of initiative continues with the cooperation of friends and friends
 ”gauratlab he ki gyanaranjan kii swasthya-sambandhi dikkaton or aarthik chunautiyon kii vajah se hi pahal kaa safar kareeb teen saal pehle band ho gaya tha
 So magazines like Streekal remained irregular and almost closed due to these reasons and now have focused on the website
 aise main kya ye patrikaayen apni parampara or saakh ko bachaane ke saath-saath or peshewar banengi? mandaloi sujhaate hai, “saahitiyik patrikaon ko sarkari vigyapanon kaa sahyog to chahie hi
 Also they need to develop their marketing system and be professional
 ” It is said that God appears in the mother's face and if you have served the mother then you do not need to worship God
 kuch aisa hi maa bhi apane bachche ke chehre ko dekhakar mahasoos karti he
 a child is weak or a healthy mother's love never diminishes for her child
 aapane kai baar special bachche dekhe honge or man hi man ek baar to jarur dayaa ke bhav se unki maa ke bare main sochaa hoga ki ye baccha to unhen koi khushi nahin de saktaa
 But do you know that the faith and love of the Commission is the same for every child because his child is a God given gift for that mother
 jo baat duniya kaa koi insaan nahin samaj saktaa vah maa kaa man bin kahe samaj jaataa he
 In this video, see the precious love of such mothers and the dreams of their open eyes for their children
 tabhi to kehete hai jise apane sukh-dukh kii parvaah nahin use maa kehete hai
 Our heartfelt gratitude to his dedication and love

 "" These days there is talk of serial 'utran' on TV, then people in Bollywood are narrating stories of Shahrukh Khan's 'utran'
 suna ja rahaa he farah kii jis film "tismar khan" ko shahrukh khan ne naa kar di thi, ab wo film aa gai he akshay kumaar kii jholii main
 Now Farah Khan and Shah Rukh Khan may not have such a long conversation, because Farah Khan is going to direct his new film 'teesamar Khan'
 aisa pehali baar hoga ki farah ke munh se lite, camera or ection guunjega or ection shuru karenge shahrukh kii bajaay akshay kumaar
 Yes, Teesamar Khan is Akshay Kumar
 hameshaa shahrukh ko 'mai hum naa' kehane vaali farah khan ne ab kah diya 'main nahin hum naa'
 Farah, along with her husband Shirish Kunder, has signed Akshay Kumar in Shah Rukh Khan's contest
 is maukey ko paakar akshay behad khush hai
 Akshay Kumar said, 'yes, i am doing Farah's film Teesamar Khan
 meraa farah or unke pati shiris kundar se bada purana rishta he
 i did Shirish's first film Jaanman and have done two films with Farah's brother Sajid Khan
 main yah nahin jaanata ki kya ye film shabarukh ke liye likhi gai thi, ye to farah hi jaane
 Not only this, Farah has also gone ahead to make Shah Rukh's elder Dushman Salman's girlfriend Katrina Kaif the lead heroine of his film
 is tarah farah ke pati shiris ne shahrukh ke saath chapter close karne kaa elaan kar diya he
 Now the question is how did Akshay and Katrina break into Shahrukh and Farah's camp, then the people of the industry believe that this rift has created Farah's husband Shirish
 shiris kii khunnas yah he ki shahrukh khan unhen zyada pasand nahin karte or naa hi unke saath filmein karnaa chaahate hai, jabaki farah khan maanati he ki shahrukh kii dosti ke bina wo adhuri hai
 Shahrukh is very important to him
 farah kii har kaarobaar main shahrukh khan kaa shaamil hona lajimi mana jaataa tha
 Ever since Farah Khan joined Shah Rukh in the industry, his success and recognition took off
 film 'dil se' ke 'chhiya chhiya' se shuru hua ye safar 'om shanti om' tak lagaataar dhamaake kar chukaa he, lekin ab jab farah ne shahrukh ko chhod kar akshay kumaar ko tismar khan ke taur par chunaa he, usase yah to tay ho gaya ki is industry main dosti kitni bhi gahari ho uski umr lambii nahin hoti

 The petition also sought to quash the Election Commission's order to dismiss the BSP memorandum complaining of EVM malfunctions
 tippaniyan The BSP has demanded from the Supreme Court that the Election Commission be ordered to conduct all future elections from evms with VVPAT (paper trail) of Assembly and Lok Sabha, out of which the slip comes out when votes are cast

 On the charge of giving tickets to criminals by giving money to BJP MP RK Singh, there was a stir in the politics of Bihar
 maamla badhata dekh grih mantri rajnath singh ko safai deni padi
 Rajnath did not talk much on this issue
 sirf itnaa hi kaha ki bijepi main siton kaa bantwaaraa soch-samajhakar nyaaypurna tareeke se kiya jaataa he
 Sushil Modi said - Such allegations are made in every election
 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and BJP leader Sushil Modi said the allegations of RK Singh are baseless
 saath hi kaha ki is tarah ke aarope har chunaav ke baad hamen jhelane padate hai
 This is not the first time
 bijepi ne kisi bhi criminal ko tikat nahin diya he
 Allegations put on us are baseless

 Chirag said - In bjp's internal Mamlabihar, Chirag, BJP MP of LJP and bjp's son Ramvilas Paswan refused to comment on the matter
 unhone kaha ki yah bijepi kaa andruni maamla he
 She has already clarified this
 This is bjp's internal matter

 jagadishpur main 3 karod rupee main ek ranger ko tikat de diya gaya

 India is changing and Bombay High Court also believes something like this
 hai court ne kaha he ki shaadi kaa vaada kar sambandh banane kaa har maamla balaatkaar nahin hota, court ne to yah bhi kaha he ki bharat main khaskar bade shaharon main abashaadi se purv sexkoi chaunkaane vaali baat nahin he
 Actually, the court made this remark while hearing the bail plea of rahul Patil of Nashik
 rahul patil par unki purv garlfriend seemaa deshmukh ne shaadi kaa vaada kar balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Seema claimed that she had become pregnant after making the relationship but despite promising, Rahul married another girl
 duusari taraf is maamle ke abhiyukt rahul ne apni safai main kaha ki unka rishta aapasi rajamandi se bana tha lekin unki jati alag hone ke kaaran shaadi nahin ho saki
 Significantly, both Rahul and Seema are lawyers by profession
 ek angreji akhbaar main chhapi khabar ke mutabik donon 1999 se ek duusare ke saath the or unke bich 2006 main shaareerik sambandh sthapit hue the
 Seema claimed that Rahul had promised to marry her earlier but in 2009 she refused to marry
 seemaa ke mutabik usne iske baad aatmahatya kaa prayaas bhi kiya tha
 Even after this, the physical relationship between the two continued to be maintained
 is maamle par sunwaayee karte hue bombai hai court kii justise mridula bhatkar ne kaha, aajkal prem sabandhon main yaa shaadi se pehle shaareerik sambandh utani badi baat nahin he jitani ki ye pehle hua karti thi
 This is more common especially in metro cities like Mumbai and Pune
 justise bhatkar ne aage kaha, haalanki pashchimi deshon kii tarah khulaapan hamaare samaaj main ab bhi nahin aayaa he
 We still do not see the sexual relations of youth before marriage properly
 lekin court samaaj or yuvaaon ke sambandhon main aa rahe badlaav se anjaan nahin rah sakati

 Due to which the child died on the spot
 bachche kii pahchaan mohammad bilal shaikh ke taur par hui he, jo pehali kaksha main padhata tha

 Agenda Aaj Tak is an attempt to take the 12-year-old ruler to a new level in the world of news
 11 saalon tak india today conklev yojit karne ke baad india today group lekar aa rahaa he hindi jagat kaa ye mahamanch, jiskaa theme he 'india maange mor'
 There will be debate on this great stage, from politics to theater, from society to language
 jo baaten hongi, wo aainaa hongi aaj kii soch or kal kaa sach kii
 The most important thing is that these things will be in Hindi
 do dinon tak chalane vaale agenda ajtak ke is mahamanch main shaamil hongi siyaasi manch kii kai diggaj hastiyaan
 There will be talk from national politics to regional politics
 alag-alag rajya, alag-alag agenda or inhen alag-alag agendon par baat karne ke liye alag-alag rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi rahenge maujuud is mahamanch par
 Those faces will also shine on this platform of mahabhas and mahamanthan, who have shaken the political ground of the country through social movement
 isamen siyasat kii baat hogi, samaaj kii baat hogi
 On the ground of changing social nature and concern, there will also be talk of the game, which has become a religion for India
 cricket ho, kitna cricket ho, kahaan tak cricket ho- in sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye bharat or pakistan ke paanch purv captain khud maujuud rahenge is manch par
 Neighborhood impacted 65 years of history of the country
 kal kaisaa hoga ye rishta, is par bolne ke liye pakistan se aaenge taharik-e-insaaf ke adhyaksh imran khan
 Imran's presence in this era of cricket diplomacy will also be important because he has also understood this country as a cricketer
 agenda ajtak main baat us aaine kii bhi hogi, jo barason se rupahale parde par desh kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sthitiyon ko dikhaata aayaa he
 You will also know how the world of Bollywood sees this changing India
 6 or 7 disambar ko is mahamanch par tay hoga agenda
 Agenda to take today's India to tomorrow
 kul 21 seshan main 40 se zyada vaktaa rakhenge apane vichaar
 Agenda: In this first year till date, for two days in the capital of the country, eminent people of the country and the world will consult each other
 agenda ajtak main tamaam vishyon par khub hogi charchaa
 Also, people participating in this can ask a lot of questions
 priya dutt ne pehali baar manyata par kaha ki vah sunil dutt or naragis dutt ke parivaar kii bahu nahin he
 She is not Sanjay Dutt's wife
 usne keval mere bhai ko apni raajnneetik or filmi ichchhaaon ko puraa karne ke liye yah sab dhong rachaa he
 "I am happy that my father is not alive to see the situation today," said Priya Dutt, the daughter of late actor Sunil Dutt, a famous Hindi film actor
 saansad priya dutt ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party se sanjay dutt ke chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa par vah hairaan hai
 Sanjay Dutt did not take any advice from the whole family
 ek akhbaar ko die saakshaatkaar main hindi filmon ke mashhoor abhinayta or purv congressi netaa swargeey sunil dutt kii beti priya dutt ne kaha ki sanjay dutt kii patni manyata ke kaaran dutt parivaar kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 Priya said that if Sanju wanted to contest elections, he could get a ticket from the Congress at the right time
 hamaare pita ne aaj tak kabhi samaajawaadee party se naata nahin rakhaa he
 Even now the ink of the verdict had not dried up that Sanjay Dutt's plea to be forgiven was put in the court of the Governor of Maharashtra by none other than a former Honorable Judge of the Supreme Court
 nyaayamurti em
 N
 katju ne apni guhaar ke paksh main dilachasp daleelein di hai
 One is that Sanjay Dutt was not found guilty of the 1993 bomb blasts and was not considered a terrorist
 unhen bina license pratibandhit hathiyaar apane paas rakhane kaa hi doshi mana gaya
 Secondly, this incident occurred 20 years ago, since then it has seen a lot of humiliation and ups and downs
 tisare, vah 18 maheene jail main kaat chukaa he
 Fourth argument, he is married and father of two young children
 paanchvaan, unke mata-pita samaaj or raashtra kii bhalaai ke liye kaam karte the
 Sixth argument, he has renewed the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and his message through his film
 sawaal yah he ki agar katju kii apil maan lee gai to kya inamen se koi bhi daleel akele yaa samuhik rup se nyaay kii kasuti par tik paaegi? yah pareshaani main daalane vaala andeshaa he, kyonki peshey se vakil ek kendriya mantri kah chuke hai ki unki raay main vajan he or uskaa sammaan hona chahie
 The Congress government in Maharashtra, under pressure from the film industry, can certainly recommend the pardon to the governor by considering the opinion of a former Supreme Court judge as a strong legal basis
 haalanki sanjay dutt press conference karke saaf kah chuke hai ki ve kshamaa yachana nahin karenge
 We must understand here the true state of the Constitution and the law, which was not so clear at the time of Nanavati pardon in the 60s
 haalanki aaj usee ko beshkeemtee misaal ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the Supreme Court, the right to pardon is part of our constitutional process, not a personal act of mercy on the part of the empowered bench
 icchaanusaar yaa belgaum dhang se iskaa istemaal nahin ho saktaa
 The court has clearly stated that the right of pardon cannot be a law in itself, but should be governed by the nuances of the constitutional system
 so is maamle main die gaye kshamaadaan ko paanch tarkon se chunauti di ja sakati he
 One, it is given without mind
 do, aadesh ke peeche manshaa thik nahin
 Three, it is entirely based on irrelevant arguments
 chaar, sambhddha saamagree ko vichaar ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Five, this order is arbitrary
 sanjay dutt ke mukademe ke tathyon ko samajhane main hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ko thodaa vakt laga or kuch chaanbin bhi kerani padi
 We waited for the next day's newspapers
 par tatkaal maafee kii maang karne waalon ko shaayad ye tathy munh jubaani yaad the
 Dutt waited for the consignment to arrive, quietly helping to bring the weapons into his compound
 ve anis ibrahim ke sampark main the jo daaud ibrahim kaa bhai or ek mukhya shadyantrkaari he
 They also sent weapons to destroy
 to kya vah sirf takneekee aparaadh kaa doshi he? jaahir taur par nahin
 Every person convicted of a crime is subjected to a lengthy tortuous judicial process
 har sajayaftaa jo kshamaadaan kii apil karata he, kaaphi samay jail main bitaata he
 Sanjay Dutt has a wife and small children, so he also belongs to all other criminals
 kaiyon ke maa-baap mashhoor chaahe na hon, bhale log honge, jinhone apane samudaay kii seva bhi kii hogi
 Many will also have the talent of the artist
 main agar rajya sarkaar kaa vakil hota or inamen se kisi bhi daleel ke aadhaar par kshamaadaan ko uchit tehraane kii koshish karata to shaayad badi vinamrata se mujhe apni file band karke duusare mukademe par dhyaan lagane kii salaah di jaati
 Nanavati pardon was decided in a different phase and the facts of the case are completely different anyway
 tab koi tabaahi nahin machi thi, samaaj yaa desh par aatank kaa saaya nahin tha
 It was a case of killing the wife's lover and Commander Nanavati was very polite in the whole incident
 unhone prem ahuja se poocha tha ki kya vah jimmedaari legaa or unki patni se shaadi karegaa? marane se pehle vah unke munh par hansaa tha
 After killing her, Commander Nanavati himself appeared before the police
 rajyapal se kshamaadaan milane ke baad kaawas nanavati, unki patni silvia or teen bachche bharat chhodkar canada chale gaye or kabhi nahin laute
 If Sanjay Dutt gets an apology, then he will start earning from films
 par baaki abhiyukt jail main sadate rahenge
 Just days after Katju appealed in favor of Sanjay Dutt, Justice Katju was admitted to Ilham and remembered Jabunnisa Kazi
 uski sifarish ke liye katju ko sochane-samajhane main vakt laga par dutt kii sifarish turat-phurat karnaa uchit laga
 Now that the accused himself has given up the option of pardon, the constitutional justification is that all appeals of the third parties to the state and central governments should be handed over to the trash
 bevajaah jhel daalane waalon par kanoon kii najar jaraa tedi hi rahati he
 (based on a conversation with Shravya Jain) Raju Ramachandran is a senior Supreme Court lawyer
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne patni ko die jane vaaleguzaara bhattapar bada faisla diya he
 The court has said that while deciding maintenance allowance, it should be seen whether the husband can give that much or not
 uski jimmedaariyon par bhi gaur kiya janaa chahie
 The Patiala House Court also rejected the interim Gujara's demand for a deranged woman's estranged husband in a domestic violence case
 adishnal seshans jaj amit bansal ne yah faisla sunaate hue magistrial court kaa aadesh barkaraar rakhaa
 In this, the decision was made on the basis of financial condition of the husband
 patni ne magistrial court ke faisle ko chunauti di thi
 The court said that the husband gets a salary of four and a half thousand rupees every month
 isamen bhi 1,300 rupye vidhwaa maa or maansik rup se veikshipt ladke ke ilaaj par kharch ho jate hai
 Spending like electricity, water are different
 pati kii puri kamai to niyamit kharch main hi chali jaati hogi
 The court also said, 'the woman could not bring the husband's salary proof'
 jabaki pati ke daawey ko court ne sweekaar kar liya
 It was said that the woman has residential property in her name which she can earn money by renting

 Mamta Banerjee accused the BJP of acting like a militant organization
 mamata ke mutabik bijepi jab se centre main ai he, baahubal dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Mamta said, 'I invite them to come here and see the political reality
 kya unhone nahin dekha ki panchayat chunaavon main kya hua? kyonki aap dilli main shashan kar rahe hai, aap bandook or bam kii bhashaa main bol sakate hai
 But what if you are not in power
 log bhavishya main jaldi hi aapako thikaane laga denge
 'let us tell you that West Bengal Police has filed an FIR against BJP state president Dilip Ghosh for making inflammatory speech in Jalpaiguri on Tuesday
 ghosh ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon se kaha tha ki agar un par tiemasi kii ore se hamalaa kiya jaataa he to wo bhi utani hi takat ke saath palatwaar karen
 Ghosh said, 'our patience also has a limit
 
 
 hamane koi bond likhakar nahin diya he ki jo ham par hamalaa karegaa ham use muft rasagulle khilaaenge
 
 
 They will be answered with bomb for bomb, bullet for bullet and sticks for every stick
 
 
 'ghosh ne jile main ‘kanoon ulanghan kaarykram’ kii aguai karte hue party kaaryakartaaon se kaha, 'tiemasi ke dada jo yahaan gundgardee kar rahe hai, main unase kahata hum, wo din zyada dur nahin he jab tum yaa to jail jaaoge yaa sidhe encounter main maare jaaoge
 'police have registered a case against Ghosh under Section 143 / 186 / 188 / 506 of Indian Penal Code
 mamata kaa ye bayaan tab aayaa he jab ek or bengal bijepi ke netaa sayathan basu ne dilip ghosh kii tippanee doharaai
 Talking to party workers in Birbhum, Basu said, “my state president has spoken of encounters
 main phir bolta hum ki agar bijepi satta main aati he to aparaadhiyon ko 72 ghanta degi
 They will surrender here or else be prepared for the encounter

 com / tixmvtv825 Accusing Digvijay Singh of destabilizing the Kamal Nath government, Singhar said - Singing a letter to Digvijay Singh Gandhi in the direction of creating an alternative power center, Singhar's complaint of Digvijay has reached the door of party president Sonia Gandhi
 soobe ke van mantri umang singhar ne apni hi party ke varisht netaa digvijay singh par kamalnath sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa aarope lagaate hue sonia gandhi se shikaayat kii he
 Forest Minister Umang Singhar has alleged in a letter to Sonia Gandhi that Digvijay Singh is plotting to destabilize his own government and is in the process of setting up an alternative power center in the state
 singhar ne 'india today' se is baat kii pushti kii he ki unhone sonia gandhi ko patr likhaa he
 However, he did not mention the letter as to what his bottom line was
 satta kaa centre bane digvijayhaalanki 'india today' ko patr ke bare main jaankaree mili he jisamen singhar likhte hai, 'kaaphi dukh ke saath main ise aapke sangyaan main laa rahaa hum ki digvijay singh khud ko vaikalpik satta centre ke rup main sthapit karne kii koshish karte hue kamalnath ke netritv vaali sarkaar ko asthir karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 They are constantly writing letters to the Chief Minister and his cabinet colleagues and releasing them on social media
 aisa karke ve vipakshi bijepi ko sarkaar par hamalaa karne ke liye gola-barood muhaiyaa kara rahe hai
 'singhar further writes in the letter,' On Friday 30 August, Digvijay Singh wrote a similar letter to all the ministers of Madhya Pradesh government seeking clarification regarding the action taken on their transfer and recommendations of posting
 unhone soshal media par bhi patr jari kiya
 After this, the opposition BJP seized the occasion and attacked the government saying that Digvijay Singh was running the government from behind the scenes
 'ghotaalon kii jaanch kii maangadigvijay singh ke patr kaa van mantri umang singhar ne kya jawaab diya? patrakaron ke is sawaal par shinger ne kaha, 'pradesh kaa har vyakti iske bare main jaanata he
 Everybody in the government and the opposition also knows that Digvijay Singh is running the government from behind the scenes, then what is the need to write a letter to him
 'singhar ne sonia gandhi ko likhe patr main yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki digvijay singh vyaapman ghotaalaa, tender ghotaalaa or paudharopan ghotaalaa jaise maamle kaaphi oochaal rahe hai or mukhyamantri kamalnath se isaki jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai lekin ve sinhasth yaa ujjain kumbh mela ghotaale kii ratti bhar baat nahin karte
 Singhar said, "simhastha scam is the result of the urban administration department of his son Jayawardhan Singh
 jayavardhan singh ne vidhansabha main is bare main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki ujjain kumbh main koi ghotaalaa nahin hua, jabaki tab vipaksh main rahi congress ne ise bada mudda banaaya tha
 'the differences between the Digvijay camp and the Kamal Nath camp in Madhya Pradesh are obvious, but in recent times it has seen a lot of momentum
 digvijay singh kai dafe apni hi sarkaar ko mushkil main daalate dikhte hai

 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main exis maai india agsit pole ne tamaam rajyon main siton kaa sateek anumaan lagaakar sabit kiya ki india today group chunaav se judi kawarej main kyon sabase aage rahata he
 And why on the counting day people across the country showed the most trust on @indiatoday and @aajtak
 survey kii ye prakriya pashchim bengal main khaastaur par mushkil or jatil thi
 People in this state respond differently than in other parts of the country
 yahaan tak ki is rajya se nattejey bhi desh ke anya hisson se alag dekhe gaye
 Where there was a storm of Modi everywhere and the opposing parties had to be defeated
 vahiin pashchim bengal main bijepi ke vot share main jabardast oochaal ke baavjood mamata banerjee kii party tiemasi ne apni jameen kuch had tak bachaae rakhi
 However, TMC lost 12 seats compared to 2014 Lok Sabha elections
tmc has suffered the biggest loss saal 2009 main rajya kii satta main aane ke baad se tiemasi ko ye sabase bada nuksaan sahanaa padaa he
 Talking about the vote share in West Bengal, tmc's vote share rose from 40% to 43%
 exis maai india survey main jaise anumaan lagaaya gaya tha vaise hi bijepi ne pichley chunaav ke 16% vot share ke mukaable is baar 40% vot hasil kiye
 The BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats, surprising everyone in this Lok Sabha election
 congress ko rajya main 6% vot share ke saath is chunaav main do loksabhaa siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 The Congress' presence is now confined to its strongholds like Malda and Murshidabad
 kisi vakt left kaa abhed durg maane jane vaale pashchim bengal main ab uskaa vot share 6% par sikud gaya he
 Though the Left has a vote share of the Congress, but it did not have a single Lok Sabha seat, so its loss is much bigger than the Congress
 exis maai india ke data ne dikhaaya ki is baar pashchim bengal main aae badlaav ke peeche kya kuch ahm factor rahe
 The voting pattern also changed according to age group
 agar 18-25 ayuvarg kii baat kii jaae to is varg ke 42% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 TMC got 1% less than BJP i
e
 41% votes from younger voters
 agar 26-35 aayu varg kii baat kii jaae to is varg se bijepi or tiemasi ko 42-42% vot mili
 43% of the voters in the age group of 36-50 voted for TMC and 41% for BJP
 haalanki 50 varsh se upar ke ayuvarg ke adhiktar votaron yani 45% ne tiemasi ke paksh main vot diya
 At the same time 37% of the voters from this category voted for BJP
 profeshnal digridharakon ne bijepi ko bharpoor samarthan diya
 53% of the voters from this category voted for the BJP
 is varg se mahaj 33% votaron ne hi tiemasi ko vot diya
 In terms of educational level, BJP got 35% to 40% votes in classes ranging from illiterates to post graduates
 vahiin tiemasi ko har varg main 40% se adhik vot milanaa isaki lokapriyata kaa saboot he
 On the other hand, the Left and the Congress could not even cross the double-digit figure in vote share in any category
 mahila votaron kii baat kii jaae to 44% ne tiemasi ke paksh main vot diya
 42% of male voters voted TMC
 bijepi ko mahila or purush votaron se baraabar 40-40% vot mili
 Urban voters preferred BJP to vote more than TMC
 shahari votaron main 46% ne bijepi or 39% ne tiemasi ko vot diya
 This trend was reversed in rural areas
 gramin votaron main 44% ne tiemasi or 39% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 The agricultural laborers gave full support to TMC
 is varg se 51% votaron ne tiemasi ko vot diya
 Only 31% of the voters from this category voted for BJP
 chaatro kii baat kii jaae to unhone bijepi par adhik bharosa karnaa pasand kiya
 42% voted BJP and 39% TMC from this category

 Headley is serving a sentence in a US prison in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case
 guuruuvaar ko hedli ne adaalat ko bataaya ki ishrat jahaan aatanki sanghathan lashkar kii hi sadsy thi
 Rajendra Kumar said, 'the information from Headley reveals that the CBI case against him was a deep conspiracy by the high and mighty people of that time to end the political challenge against him
 unhone kaha, 'tab satta main rahi congress ne bijepi main pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar ke rup main majbootee se ubhar rahe narendra modi ke khilaaf badhat banane ke liye ye farji cese taiyaar karavaaya

 vipakshi dalon ne unke is bayaan kii kadi aalochana karte hue sarkaar se is bare main spashtikaran maanga he
 On this statement of Sakshi Maharaj, Amit Shah has said that this is his personal comment

 Sakshi Maharaj said, we accepted the slogan 'hum do, hamara ek'
 tab bhi in deshadrohiyon ko santosh nahin hua he
 He gave another slogan 'hum do aur hamare

 The saffron-clad MP from Unnao said at a religious conference yesterday, 'that's why i want to urge Hindu women to give birth to at least four children

 ' Sakshi Maharaj had earlier raised a controversy by calling Nathuram Godse, the murderer of Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, a 'patriot' and for this he was forced to apologize in Parliament

 jabaki congress sirf 39 siten hi jeet pai thi
 While 2 seats went to others

 tab randeep ne jind chunaav jeetne par kaithal kii seat chhodane kii baat kahi thi, ab unke virdohi bhi isko mudda bana rahe hai
 The fact is that from 2014 to 2019, Randeep paid less attention to the state's politics due to being busy in Delhi's politics but he also has Kaithal development work to count

 The government ombudsman bill only talks about corruption of senior officers

 Prashant Bhushan, the third member of civil society, told the people that the government has no objection to bringing the Prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejasaath hi saansadon kaa bartaav bhi lokapal ke daayre main aana chahie is mudde par bhi kuch sahmati bani he
 On the question of bringing the Member of Parliament to the Lokpal, the Government cited Section 105 of the Constitution under which the Parliament would be exempted from speaking in Parliament

 The process of by-election for 58 new members and one seat for Rajya Sabha has been completed in 16 states of the country
 in 58 siton main 25 siton ke liye chunaav 6 rajyon main karaae gaye jabaki 10 rajyon se 33 sadsy bina kisi virodh ke rajya sabha pahunch rahe hai
 According to the final results, BJP has become the largest party in Rajya Sabha
 chunaav ke antim nateezon se desh kii raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi, kya loksabhaa kii tarah rajya sabha main bhi bijepi apana varchasv banaaegi? yadi nahin to rajya sabha kii maujuuda sthiti kaa kya asar 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon par padegaa?' aaie jaanate hai aane vaale dinon main bijepi kii raajnneeti par iskaa kya asar hoga
 In these Rajya Sabha elections, BJP has won 29 seats, Congress has got 9 seats, TMC has 4 seats, while TRS-BJD has got 3 seats
 tidipi or argedy ne 2-2 siten or samaajawaadee party, shivasena, ensipi or wiesar congress ko ek-ek seat mili he
 In the House of Arithmetic, the BJP has benefited from the number of 10 mps, which has increased the BJP from the current 58 members to 68
 uske saathiyon ko milakar endie kaa aankada 86 ho gaya he
 However, this figure is far below the 123 seats required for majority in Rajya Sabha
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda chunaavon ke baad congress ko bahut zyada nuksaan nahin hua he, uske paas 54 siten bani hui hai
 The Congress also had 54 mps in the Upper House earlier in the Rajya Sabha
 congress ke sahyogi dalon ko mila den to upie kaa aankada 68 tak pahunchataa he
 Therefore, one thing is clear in this situation that BJP does not have majority in the tenure of the current Lok Sabha
 iske liye use ek baar phir 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main prachand bahumat main aane ke saath-saath 2018 or 2019 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main badhat banani hogi
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for the BJP to catch up with its agenda of Hindutva before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main vikaas ke agenda ke saath-saath apane hindutv ke agenda ko badhaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 After the election results, when a strong Modi government was formed at the Center, the party pushed forward policies of fast development to bring good days
 ab jab 2019 ke aam chunaav main mahaj ek saal kaa vakt bachaa he, tej vikaas aarthik aankadon se gaayab he or bijepi ke achche din ke saamne vahi sawaal khadey ho rahe hai jo atal bihari vaajapeyi ke shining india ke saamne the
 In such a situation, the BJP had the option of going back on the Hindutva agenda, but the Modi government would not even get a chance to go on its Hindutva agenda for the next one year due to lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne beete kai dashakon se hindutv ke agenda kii baat kii he
 For this agenda, during the last 4 years, the Modi government has drafted the removal of the Uniform Civil Code, Section 370 and to conduct the Lok Sabha as well as the assembly elections across the country
 lekin in sabhi masaudon par aage badhane ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kii jarurat he jiske liye yah jaruri he ki bijepi ko loksabhaa ke saath-saath rajya sabha main vishesh bahumat mili
 To live up to the Hindutva agenda, it is also necessary that the BJP has a special majority government in at least 15 states
 haalanki maujuuda samay main bijepi ke 15 rajyon main mukhyamantri ke saath-saath 21 rajyon main gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 But in the event of the possibility of a majority in the Rajya Sabha after the 2019 elections, this figure can also be seen to change
 gauratlab he ki jahaan haryana, jammu-kashmir, jharkhand or maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke turant baad honge vahiin andhrapradesh, arunachal pradesh, odisha, sikkim or telugana kaa chunaav loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath karaayaa jayega
 Apart from this, assembly elections of Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram and Rajasthan will be held in 2018 just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 in chunaavon ke baad yadi kendra main bijepi ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha main vishesh bahumat ke saath-saath 15 rajyon main do-tihaai bahumat vaali sarkaar rahegi tab modi sarkaar ke liye hindutv ke agenda par kargar faisla liya ja sakegaa

 The government waives the taxes of big companies and deducts the taxes of people like us

 The comments dopaher ke vakt aise phone aate rahete hai

 Everybody's work is very minor, but has been raging for months
 principal sahab ne sirf apni baat hi bataai, mujhase kuch kaha nahin
 He said that you should show the point of both sides

 i do not want you to just do my work, but the government knows
 sarkaar ko kaise pataa chalata hoga, kya sarkaar ko vaaki pataa nahin hota hoga
 He was thinking that the principal gave a phone with a lot of blessings

 You are speaking

 He also wrote the Ombudsman of the Reserve Bank of India in Patna
 sirf itnaa kehane bhar se, ki main hi bol rahaa hum, udhar se aati awaz express mail kii tarah raftaar pakadaney lagi
 Very much explained that you breathe a little and tell it comfortably, then the voice of the elderly started to stop

 As the DA progressed from year to year, my pension increased to a little over three lakhs
 maine pan card ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 Done in 1998 and 2003, but the PAN card arrives this April
 pan card nahin hone ke kaaran bank vaale ne automatic tids kaat liya he
 The government says that PAN card will be available in 48 hours
 meri galati thi ki pan card nahin banwaaya, lekin maine aavedan to kar hi diya tha
 Now if the maker has not given the PAN card then he should also be punished or not
 pan card nahin hone par meraa to tex kaat liya, lekin jisane pan card banane main deree kii, uske khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 The speak of the principal continued

 i have to say to you that when the bank has already deducted TDS, should i get its certificate or not
 desh ke liye hi tex kaata na, main to uskaa hisaab nahin maang rahaa, bas itnaa kah rahaa hum ki certificate milanaa chahie

 haa sar, aapako certificate to milanaa chahie
 But Ravish Babu is not giving the bank person
 main sasaram inkam tex afasar ke paas bhi gaya
 The officer also called the banker asking why they are bothering an elderly person, so the banker started scaring me that you have gone to the Income Tax Officer, now you will be raided
 maine kah diya ki main master rahaa hum
 If there is no more than a disproportionate asset, then why would it be raided? aap meraa certificate dijie
 And i am saying, many people like me are upset here

 Some have died, but TDS certificate is not available

 Today my taught children are professors in Banaras Hindu University, also IAS officers, but i am not able to get a certificate
 sarkaar badi-badi companiyon ke tex maaf kar detii he or ham jaise logon ke tex kaat leti he
 Definitely cut, but give TDS certificate
 tippaniyan Such calls keep on coming in the afternoon
 bahut sari chitthiyaan bhi aati hai
 Everyone is upset with some officer or employee
 sabake kaam behad maamuli hai, lekin maheenon se dhakke kha rahe hai
 The principal only spoke about himself, did not say anything to me
 yahi kaha ki aap donon paksh kii baat dikhaaiye
 Not just me, but also take the side of State Bank of India
 main nahin chahta ki aap sirf meraa kaam karen, lekin sarkaar ko pataa to chale
 How would the government know, would the government not really know
 yahi soch rahaa tha ki principal sahab ne dher sara aashirwad dekar phone rakh diya

 See Ravish Babu, i have been the principal of the school

 No tax was deducted
 saal-dar-saal die badhate-badhate meraa pension teen lakh se kuch zyaada kaa ho gaya
 i had applied for PAN card
 1998 or 2003 main kiya, lekin pan card is april main aayaa he
 Due to not having a PAN card, the bank has deducted automatic TDS
 sarkaar kahati he ki 48 ghante main pan card milegaa
 My mistake was that PAN card was not made, but i had already applied
 ab agar banane vaale ne pan card nahin diya to use bhi sazaa milani chahie ki nahin
 My tax was deducted for not having a PAN card, but no action was taken against the person who delayed making the PAN card
 principal sahab kaa bolnaa jari rahaa
 i was just feeling this trouble of theirs
 yah soch rahaa tha ki koun kya kar saktaa he is maamle main
 Sir, what can i do with this? mujhe pataa he, aap kuch nahin kar sakate
 What can you do when writing to the finance minister did nothing? bas, main aapako apni baat sunaanaa chahta hum

 guuruuvaar shaam chah baje raashtrapati pranab mukherjee khilaadiyon ko rashtriya khel puraskaron se sammanit karne ja rahe hai, lekin vivaad hai ki in puraskaron kaa peechha hi nahin chhod rahe hai
 This time again controversies have arisen regarding Rahul Dravid
 haal hi main sanyas lene vaale cricketer rahul dravid 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' puraskaar ke sabase majboot daavedaar maane ja rahe the, lekin ab yah puraskaar unhen kabhi nahin diya ja sakegaa
 It was also considered difficult to find a better contender than Dravid for the award, but the committee, headed by former Olympic medalist Rajyavardhan Rathore, gave the shooters Vijay Kumar and wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt leaking importance to the medals won at the London Olympics
 Decided to give away this honor
 isse yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki cricket se ritair ho chuke dravid ko ab aage khelratna puraskaar nahin diya ja sakegaa
 However, the BCCI has decided to send the name of Dravid for Padmabhushan, which is the third highest civilian honor in the country and so far nine cricketers have been awarded the Padma Bhushan
 vaise vivaadon kii shuruyaat varsh 2005 main hi ho gai thi, jab 2004 ke athens olympic main rajat padak jeetne vaale rajyavardhan rathod ko usee saal arjuna puraskaar or agle saal yani 2005 main khelratna puraskaar de diya gaya tha
 This time the chairman of the awards selection committee was Rathore himself, but he decided to give Khelratna to Olympic medalists instead of Dravid
 is tarah puraane niyam bhi tode gaye or vivaadon ko bhi bulaava diya gaya
 However, when the Sports Ministry gave a separate relaxation for the cricketers after the deadline for the Sports Awards, it seemed that now Rahul Dravid will be conferred with the Khel Ratna Award this year
 is puure prakaran par purv cricket captain bishan singh bedi ne kaha he ki kahin na kahin koi chook hui he, kyonki rahul dravid ko kisi bhi puraskaar ke liye apni yogyata siddh karne kii jarurat nahin he or vah hamaari jaankaree main behtareen cricketer hai
 Apart from this, as usual this time too there are many players who are questioning the selection process of Arjuna and other sports awards
 kuch ne artiai ke jariye sawaal uthaate hue khel mantralay se jawaab talab kiya he, jabaki kuch adaalat jane kii baat kah rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that there are many such legendary players from Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble to Mahesh Bhupathi who, despite their abilities, could not get the 'rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna' award
 jaahir he, ye naam is puraskaar kii chayan samitiyon ke aage hameshaa sawaal banakar khadey rahenge
 Staying in controversy has become the nature of sports awards and if this award was given to Dravid and next time Olympic medalists, there would have been no controversy and no objection

 is baar phir rahul dravid ko lekar vivaadon ne janm liya he
 Recently retired cricketer Rahul Dravid was considered the strongest contender for the 'rajiv Gandhi Khelratna' award, but now the award will never be given to him
 is puraskaar ke liye dravid se behatar daavedaar ko dhundhna bhi mushkil mana ja rahaa tha, lekin purv olympic padak vijeta rajyavardhan rathod kii adhyakshata main bani cameti ne landan olympic main jite gaye padakon ko ahmiyat dete hue nishanebaaj vijay kumaar or pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt ko li se hatakar yah sammaan dene kaa faisla kiya
 This also made it clear that Dravid, who has retired from cricket, will no longer be given the Khel Ratna Award
 haalanki, bisisiai ne dravid kaa naam padmabhushan ke liye bhejne kaa faisla kiya he, jo desh kaa teesraa sabase bada naagarik sammaan he or ab tak nau cricketron ko padmabhushan se nawaja ja chukaa he
 The controversy started in 2005, when Rajyavardhan Rathore, who won a silver medal in the 2004 Athens Olympics, was given the Arjuna Award in the same year and the Khelaratna Award in the following year
 is baar puraskaron kii chayan samiti ke adhyaksh khud rathod the, lekin unhone dravid kii bajaay olympic padak vijetaon ko khelratna dene kaa faisla kiya
 In this way the old rules were also broken and disputes were also called
 haalanki, khel puraskaron ke liye tay taarikh ke biit jane ke baad jab khel mantralay ne cricketron ke liye alag chhot di, to lagane laga tha ki ab rahul dravid ko is saal khelratna puraskaar se jarur nawaja jayega
 On this entire episode, former cricket captain Bishan Singh Bedi has said that there has been some lapse, because Rahul Dravid does not need to prove his eligibility for any award and he is the best cricketer to our knowledge
 iske alaava, hameshaa kii tarah is baar bhi kai aise khilaadi hai, jo arjuna or duusare khel puraskaron kii chayan prakriya par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Some have called for an answer from the Sports Ministry raising questions through RTI, while some are asking to go to court
 ullekhneey he ki saurav ganguli or anil kumble se lekar mahesh bhupati jaise kai aise diggaj khilaadi hai, jo kaabiliyat ke baavjood 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' puraskaar ke hakdaar nahin ho paae
 Obviously, these names will always stand as a question before the selection committees of this award
 vivaadon main rahanaa khel puraskaron kii fitrat ban gai he or agar is baar yah puraskaar dravid ko, or agali baar olympic padak vijetaon ko diya jaataa, to na vivaad hote or na hi kisi ko aitraaj hota
 The comments vaise, raashtrapati bhawan main guuruuvaar shaam yojit hone ja rahe samaaroh main nishanebaaj vijay kumaar or pahalwaan yogeshwar dutt ko desh ke sabase bade khel sammaan 'rajeev gandhi khelratna' se nawaja jayega
 Apart from these, Arjuna Awards will be given to 25 other players, including cricketer Yuvraj Singh, hockey player Sardar Singh, women wrestler Geeta Phogat, badminton player p Kashyap and Ashwin Ponnappa, women archers Deepika Kumari and Bombayla Devi
 landan olympic main padak vijeta susheel kumaar or yogeshwar dutt ke coach yashavir singh, mahila athlete krishna punia ke coach virender singh, boxing ke coach biai furnandis or hockey coach harendra singh sahit aath kochon ko dronacharya puraskaar die jaaenge

 jahaan tak sahvaag kaa sawaal he to yah tay he ki vankhede stadium main vah apana 100waan test match khelenge
 It will be a historic moment for him as it is the home ground of Sachin Tendulkar, who holds the record for the most 191 Test matches
 jin bhartiya cricketron ne ab tak 100 se adhik test match khele hai unamem tendulkar ke alaava rahul dravid (164), vivies lakshmana (134), anil kumble (132), kapil dev (131), sunil gavaskar (125) , dilip vengsarakar (116) or saurav ganguli (113) shaamil hai
 We all know that using boiled water instead of normal water is beneficial, but just as everything has two aspects, there are two forms of this process as well
 ek to phydemand he or doosraa nuksaandeh
 Every time you boil water, its ingredients change
 jisaki vajah se ye swasthya ke liye phydemand nahin rah jaataa saath hi isamen arsenic, nitrite or fluraide kii maatra bhi bahut adhik bad jaati he
 Boiling water too much brings many dangerous elements in it
 jaharila nitritapaani ko bahut adhik ubaalane se usamen nitrite kii maatra bad jaati he joki isi kaa ek avyav hota he
 Too much boiling of water turns nitrite into poison
 ucch taap nitrite ko nitrosamin main badal detaa he
 Which can cause life-threatening cancer
 arsenic kii matraapaani ko bahut adhik ubaal dene se isamen arsenic kii maatra bad jaati he
 Drinking water with excess arsenic increases the risk of fatal cancer, heart attack and various mental illnesses
 jo log saalon se arsenic pradooshit pani pite aa rahe hai ve twachaa sambandhi kai bimariyon ke shikaar ho jate hai
 Increasing the amount of fluoride, boiling the water too much increases the amount of fluoride in it
 ek lambey vakt tak aisa pani pite rahane sehddiyon par bura asar padataa he
 If children are drinking the same water then it has a very bad effect on them

 Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken had questioned Modi cabinet minister Smriti Irani for not being a 'graduate' and given her a very important ministry like the Human Resource Ministry
 maakan ne hairat jataate hue kaha tha ki jis vyakti ne apni shaikshik yogyata ke bare main spasht rup se zikr nahin kiya, use maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kaa prabharee kaise banaaya ja saktaa he
 Smriti is not a graduate either
 is par kendriya kanoon, iti evam sanchaar mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki agar congress pravaktaa (ajay maakan) ne aisa kaha he to yah bahut durbhagyapurna he
 The country has become familiar with the way Smriti speaks Hindi and English and the kind of leadership abilities she has
 unhone kaha tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unke gunon ke kaaran hi unhen yah pad diya he
 He has been given this position after taking care of his abilities
 prasad ne congress ke kisi netaa kaa naam liye bina kaha ki aisi tippaniyan karne se pehle congress ko pehle apane girebaan main jhankkar dekh lenaa chahie
