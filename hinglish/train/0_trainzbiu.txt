 This is where writing started
 main bataa duun ki mere vivek kaa vistaar bhi meri bhavukta or samvedansheeltaa se hua he
 That is why people often consider me impractical and stupid, which i think is justified
 2
 Where do you choose the subject of your poems? - i take the subject of poetry from life itself; nature, society, time - all are included in life itself
 baahar kii ghatnaayen jab bheetar jaati hai, manobhaavon ko jhakzorti hai, tabhi kavita footati he
 The poem is composed when the conflict pushes into compassion
 3
 Your reaction to the flagellation of litterateurs, and its attachment to a particular ideology? - Flagging may be needed as a citizen but not as a poet
 haan, vichaardhaara zarur chahie, aisi vichaardhaara jo samaaj ke aakiri aadmi ke sangharsh or karunaa ko samajhane main madad kare, uske paksh main khadaa hone kii taaqat or saahas de
 Not only understanding, ideology is also necessary for the expansion of experience
 lekin, dhyaan rahe ki vichaardhaara satta ke viruddh ek nayi yaa alag satta khadaa karti he jabaki kavi kaa kaam satta ke viruddh sashastitv nirmit karnaa hota he

 hindi sahitya main kavita kii vartmaan dasha se aap kitne santusht hai? bahudhaa dekha jaataa he ki prakaashak bhi kavy sankalan chhapane se kataraate hai, aapaki najar main iskaa jimmedaar koun he?- kavita kii apni seemaa he or khaas kuubiyaan bhi, unhen thik se pahachaanen to aise sawaal nahin uthenge
 The poem attains a little generality only when there is a big movement in the society, such as the Bhakti movement or the freedom movement
 lekin kavita bure dinon main bhi hoti or likhi jaati he
 His permanent role is to expand the reader's senses
 aaj bhi likhi ja rahi he or padhi bhi ja rahi he
 Poetry collections are also sold
 prakaashak saharsha chhapate hai, balki kaibar sankalan nahin dene yaa waapas le lene se naaraaz bhi hote hai
 Yes, this poet should know and understand whether its readers are or not
 
 
 alabatta sansthaaen katha or aalochana karidati hai, kavita sangrah or naatak nahin karidatin
 It is good that poetry does not have a market, it has few but committed readers
 5
 How important is the award to the poet? Are the writers of today making compromises for facilities and prizes? - The prize is not important, except that it gets some new readers, some people get noticed
 iskaa virodh karnaa bhi iske mahatv ko sweekaar karnaa he
 a good writer never juggles, if found easily, he should accept it, provided there is no politics behind the giving
 6
 Your comment on today's political situation as a poet? - Political conditions are very bad, because today's politicians are not undertaking to understand the social reality, collide with it and find a way to make society better
 jhooth or fareb kaa bolbalaa he
 Efforts are being made to create such a criminal popularity and create mass hypnosis, whose consequences will be seen much later
 loktantr kaa sabase bada sankat yah he ki yah vipakshaviheen hota ja rahaa he
 Opposition parties are circling around the agenda of power
 keval bharat hi nahin, vaishvik str par bade raajnneetik badlaav kii zarurat he
 Look at the recent elections in Ukraine, there was a person who won the presidential election, who is a professional comedian, with no political experience
 ab disha badalani hogi
 7
 aapke pasandida kavi- sahityakar, varisht, samakaleen va nae lekhak va unki rachanaaen, kuch kaa naam?- is prashn ko rahane dijie
 My favorite poet is Vidyapati
 or suchi itani lambii he ki
 
 
 
 
 Sorry! 8
 aapane 2009 se 2011 ke bich anekon aisi kavitaayen likhin thim, jo aaj ke sandarbhon main zyada sateek lagati hai, jaise 'vijeta hatyara' or 'nae yug ke saudagar'
 The reason for this prediction? - Actually, it is not a prediction or prediction, it is a matter of subtle observation
 kavi apane samay ke yatharth ko keval ghatnaon main nahin dekhtaa he balki, uski aantarik gatishiltaa ko pahchaanane kaa bhi upkram karata he, isi se yah sambhav hota he
 Not only between 2009 and 2011, i have many such poems after 1990 which may seem more relevant today
 9
 What is writing new these days? -nothing special
 upanyaas likhane kaa bahaanaa itnaa purana ho gaya he ki ab usase bhi bachaav nahin ho saktaa
 Yes, i am writing some different types of essays
 ye lalit niabandh se bilkul alag hai
 i would like to call these poetic essays
 10
 Your reaction to the politics and literature of politics in politics? - Where is the place of literature in politics? Just a few lines of poets like Dinkar and Dushyant are sometimes used by leaders
 haan, sahitya main siyasat kii jagah he, kyonki samaaj hi nahin, samay bhi siyasat se niyantrit ho rahaa he, balki kaibar siyasat itihaas or samskruti ko bhi niyantrit karne kii koshish karata dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is the religion of literature to face the challenges of politics
 lekin sahitya kii siyasat to bahut nikrusht chiz he
 It is for posts and awards and hurts writing
 ek pankti main kahoon to main sahitya main raajnneeti kii abhivyakti kaa pakshdhar hoon, lekin sahitya kii raajnneeti kaa ghor virdohi hoon

 Although the UP government is giving double the compensation of the fixed amount of the center, but even some checks of one and a half rupees two hundred rupees are being distributed
 sarkaar kuch sakht hui to afasar gaanvon main pahunchane lage
 Checks have been given by setting up camps
 faijabad ke gaanv main muaavje kii rakam to dekhie 187 rupee, 188 rupee
 In this case, there is not even a single meal of a man in a dhaba

 sarkari muaavje kii rakam oont ke munh main jire kii tarah he
 Compensation is Rs 4500 per hectare in irrigated area and Rs 9000 per hectare in irrigated area due to the old rule of the Center
 ek hectare main chaar bigha yani 80 katthe hota he
 Thus the compensation of one bigha in irrigated amounted to Rs
 1225
 agar revenue record main ek bighas main paanch maalik hai to har ek ko muaavje ke 225 rupee mili
 The UP government is paying double of this, but perhaps more than that would have been spent in distributing compensation

 Mamta started reading her railway budget at around 12:30 am amidst a lot of tokatoki and her budget speech lasted about two and a half hours
 is dauraan unhen vipakshi rajg ke sadasyon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 As soon as the speech was over, Sonia Gandhi stood up and patted Mamata
 isi bich vibhinn dalon ke sadasyon ne mamata banerjee ko ‘didi, didi’ kehete hue gher liya or apni apni maangon ke sambandh main parchiyaan thamane lage
 During this, Pranab da also came and patted Mamta and gave her congratulations
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa haren pathak bhi mamata ko badhaayi dene pahunche or sabase pehle unhone hi didi kii peeth thapthapai
 Amidst this noise, Sonia Gandhi drew the attention of Mamta to the Prime Minister who had risen from her seat to congratulate the Railway Minister and stood behind the members
 sonia gandhi ne sadasyon kii maangen sunne main vyast mamata kaa dhyaan congressi sadsy raaj babbar kii ore bhi dilaayaa or rail mantri se kaha ki inaki baat bhi suno
 Raj Babbar was angered by the neglect of his area in the middle of the speech

 In the film, the same sight that is required of people to double money in 21 days was seen in Betul of Madhya Pradesh
 baitool main police ne rupee dugana karne kaa jhansa dekar logon ko thagne vaale ek giroh kaa pardaafash kiya he
 Police raided Ayush Technology of Sarani and arrested three people with an amount of more than Rs 12 lakh
 inke paas se kareeb 400 jamakartaon ke dastavej or 7 karod rupee logon se anthne ke kagajaat baraamad kiye gaye hai
 The gangs involved in this racket are likely to be connected to the surrounding districts and many cities of the country
 philhal police baraamad kiye gaye dastavej or chaape main mili laptop se jaruri jaankariyaan jutaney main lagi hui he
 The accused are under police custody
 kabhi cycle par chalane vaale shaatir 25-25 lakh kii gadiyon main safar kar rahe the
 The path they took to raise the money that was coming to the vicious people for this glory is very shocking
 sarini main aayush technology ke naam se tii-shart par rangai chapai karne or printing kaa mayajaal dikhaakar ye badmaash logon ko rupee dugane karne kaa laalach de rahe the
 On the amount to be deposited, these people used to pretend to double the amount in 6 months
 yahi nahin, di gayi rakam par har maheene saadhe 13 pratishat byaaj dene kaa jhansa bhi in logon ne jamakartaon ko diya or sainkadon logon kii karodon kii rakam vyapaar main laga di thi
 In the police raids, the list of more than 400 depositors and transactions of Rs 7 to 8 crore have been revealed from them
 police ne chaape main 12 lakh rupee bhi baraamad kiye hai
 In the Bagdona area of sarani, for the past five years, these people have been luring workers working in coal mines, employees of power houses and jobbers
 isaki bhanak police ko lambe samay se thi, lekin shikayatakarta na hone kii vajah se police is giroh par haath nahin daal paa rahi thi
 Recently, a young man received from the police complained that one lakh rupees were taken from him in the name of doubling
 jab rakam dugani hone kaa vakt aayaa to use kaha gaya kii vah dugani hui rakam do lakh rupee phir se laga de
 This amount was again deposited from him, but at his return the gang refused to give the money back
 yahi galati giroh ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban gayi
 In this case, the police closely laid a trap and raided the office and house of the gang's AYUSH Technology on Wednesday morning
 police ne is maamle main aayush ke sanchaalak santosh das, karmchaaree hariram or company ke echaar mukesh bal ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The accused caught are telling themselves to be clean
 unka kahana he ki ve apni kai fermon ko chalaane ke liye logon se rupee juta rahe the
 He has also denied any fraud
 police santhaan main mili laptop bhi khangaal rahi he, jisase is maamle main lipt or kai rasukhadaaron ke raaj khulne kii ummid he
 It is believed that this gang has not only got patronage of many prominent leaders of the area but they also have a part in this racket
 dekhnaa yah hoga ki police jaanch main aage or kya-kya raaj khulkar saamne aate hai

 Akshaykut was seen in the poster but his face was not visible
 lekin first luk main akshay scooter par baithe muskuraate najar aa rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the 2013 hit film 'jolly LLB' is a sequel
 is film ke liye saurabh shukla ko best saporting actor ke liye neshnal aword mila tha
 'jolly LLB' was directed by Subhash Kapoor and in the film Arshad Warsi played the role of a lawyer who fights a high-profile case against the corrupt lawyer Irani
 pehle film se sirf saurabh shukla hi sikval main dikhaai de rahe hai
 The film will be released on 10 February next year
 sikval main hamen neshnal aword vinar anu kapur bhi dakhaai denge
 In the film, Arshad Warsi will also be seen doing cameos
 kashmir mudda pakistan ke liye gale kii fans ban gaya he
 He does not know what to do next
 vishwa birdari ke saamne usne anuchhed 370 kaa mudda kaaphi uthaaya lekin uski ek bhi daleel nahin tiki
 Almost all the countries of the United Nations Security Council (except China) returned him to the Bearang
 ab sirf china bachaa he jo uski fariyaad sun rahaa he, vah bhi dabaav main kyonki china kaa bahut kuch pakistan main daanv par laga he
 The United Nations is going to hold a meeting on Kashmir issue on Friday on the plea of china
 aisa kabhi nahin hua ki sanyukt raashtra jaisi mukhiya sanstha ko band daravaaje ke peeche baithak kerani pade lekin pakistan ke ishaare par china jo na karaae
 This is the second time in the history of the United Nations when a meeting on the Kashmir issue is going to take place
 haalanki duusari baithak 1971 kii pehali baithak se kai myanon main bhinn he
 The first meeting was neither behind closed doors nor did most member countries of the Security Council refuse to support Pakistan
 yuanessi main 1969-71 main 'sichuation in da india / pakistan sabacontinent' vishay ke tahat kashmir kaa mudda uthaaya gaya tha
 These countries of the UNSC called Pakistan the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) a total of 15 members
 inamen 5 sthai or 10 asthai hai
 The tenure of the temporary members is for a few years while the permanent members are for permanent
 sthai sadasyon main america, rus, china, britain or france shaamil hai
 Temporary countries include Belgium, Côte d'ivoire, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Indonesia, Kuwait, Peru, Poland and South Africa
 sthai sadasyon main china ko chhod den to baaki ke deshon-france, rus, britain or america ne pakistan ko thenga dikhaa diya he
 They clearly say that the Kashmir issue is an internal issue of Hindustan and Pakistan, so both countries should settle together, no third party needs it
 china kii majaburiaisa nahin he ki china, pakistan kaa ghanishtha padosi he or vah apane mitra raashtra ke liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 The big compulsion in front of China is the Belt Road Initiative (BRO), a large part of which is passing through Pakistan
 sadak nirmaan ke is bade project main china ne bahut kuch jhonk diya he
 He has invested billions of Yuan in road projects and has invested a large amount to maintain Yari from Pakistan
 aise main china ke saamne do hi vikalp hai
 The first is that he reprimands Pakistan and advances the BRO on his own
 doosraa vikalp uske saamne sabakuch bardaasht karte hue pakistan ko madad dene kaa he
 Pakistan cannot be reprimanded by China because it knows that it will only sink its money, there will be a huge loss of life and property in the road project
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki pakistani aatanki kai deshon main koharaam machaa chuke hai lekin abhi tak unhone kisi chini naagarik ko nahin chuaa he jo biaaro project main lage hai
 Therefore, China wants to stick to the first option, seeing every profit and loss
 lihaaja yuanessi kii baithak main vah pakistan kii madad kar rahaa he
 Out of 10 temporary countries, Poland is the only nation which is seen standing with Pakistan
 haalanki yah uski rajanyik majaburi he
 He has kept himself far away from this rhetoric of India and Pakistan, but since Poland is currently the rotating president of the UNSC, the last option is to have a meeting in front of him
 iskaa arth yah katai nahin nikaala janaa chahie ki poland kashmir mudde par pakistan ke saath he
 It is not with any nation but is hosting a meeting on behalf of the non-permanent countries
 poland ke alaava belgium, kot devoer, dominic republic, equatorial guyani, germany, indonesia, kuwait, peru or south africa pakistan ko puri tarah nakaar chuke hai
 Pakistan will not get full support from these countries
 tabhi videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne vishwa birdari ke saamne dukhada royaa ki gaye to sabaki dahalij par lekin bhav kisi ne nahin diya
 The veto process of UNSC countries is a strong veto process in the UN Security Council
 kisi bhi adopshan (prastaav) ko hari jhandi milane yaa use nakaarne main iskaa role kaaphi ahm he
 Under the terms set by the United Nations Charter, the right to veto permanent members of the Security Council is restricted, that is, it is not primarily applicable in matters relating to the functioning of the Security Council
 aisi sthiti main, suraksha parishad ko nirnay lene ke liye nau sadasyon ke samarthan kii jarurat hoti he, bhale hi ve suraksha parishad ke sthaayee yaa gaiyr-sthaayee sadsy hon
 The powers of non-permanent members are also reinforced like the "collective right of veto" (even if at least seven non-permanent members of the Security Council vote against an adoption, there is no support)
 pakistan ko jab itane raashtra nakaar chuke hai to vah kashmir mudde par kis munh se khuleam baithak karegaa
 In such a situation, the only option before the United Nations is that the meeting be held behind closed doors so that a country can be saved from being inundated

 BJP workers alleged that Congress had done this to create instability in Gujarat and to discredit the BJP government
 police ne suraksha ke lihaaj se yahaan pehle hi bandobast kar rakhe the
 The Delhi Police had barricaded at 5 places and deployed para military forces personnel
 pradarshan ke dauraan bijepi purvanchal morcha ke adhyaksh manish singh party kaaryakartaaon kaa utsaah badhaate najar aae

 Actually, the accused in this case was a person from Bihar, after which the anger of the people against the laborers of bihar-up was sparked

 When asked about the first exam of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Gehlot Serahul, he said that this is not the issue at all
 balki, mudda yah he ki vah aage aae or gujarat prachaar kii kaman sanbhali, vikaas ke muddon par pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa pramukh ko gheraa
 He said that the BJP had no answer to Rahul Gandhi's questions and they were forced to talk about Gujarati pride
 isamen rahul gandhi kii jeet hui
 He proved himself
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa gujarat main 22 saal se satta main he
 Rahul single-handedly led the Congress campaign in the state

 The leaders of the nearly lost Congress party in Uttar Pradesh feel that the Congress can regain its lost existence in UP
 agar vah kisi tarah se yah sabit kar de ki modi or mulaayam ke bich ek gupt siyaasi santh-ganth he
 There is no doubt that Muslim voters, who consider Mulayam Singh Yadav as their leader, will be angry with the SP if they find that there is a growing nexus between kimodi-mulayam
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki is baat kaa khamiyaja bahujan samaaj party ne bhi us vakt bhugta tha jab unhone bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha
 Its traditional vote bank, Dalits and Muslims were upset with the BSP
 loksabhaa chunaav 2009 main congress ne behatar pradarshan kiya tha
 The reason for this was Kalyan Singh being with Mulayam Singh Yadav
 kalyaan singh babari masjid vidhwans ke liye jimmedaar maane jate hai
 When this incident happened in 1992, Kalyan Singh was leading the BJP government in UP as the Chief Minister
 saal 2009 ke chunaav ke baad mulaayam singh yadav ne maafee maangate hue kaha tha, 'yah keval meri galati thi
 i promise the minority community that such a mistake will not happen again in the future
 'anjaane main hi sahi, par aisi galati kii punrariti 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress kii madad kar sakati he
 Therefore, Congress leaders have been preparing to make the issue of modi-mulayam's so-called proximity long before the assembly elections in the state
 isi makasad se uttar pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh nirmal khatri nen mulaayam singh yadav ke grih janapad itawa main logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye jan jaagran yatra nikaali
 On this occasion, Congress leader Khatri said, 'on February 21, Modi went to Saifai, Etawah to attend the wedding of Mulayam Singh Yadav's grandson
 kyonki unke bich bahut acchhee vyaktigat or raajnneetik ghanishthata ho gai he
 The way Modi and Mulayam were holding each other's hands at the ceremony is proof that the two are very close to each other
 'khatri ne shaayad sthiti kaa aankalan karne main jaldbaaji kar di he
 It is true that Mulayam Singh Yadav held Modi's hand while climbing the stage during the Tilak Festival in Saifai
 lekin modi ne sapa pramukh ko apana haath pakadaney kaa mauka nahin diya
 He waved his hand with her in the air only to convey a sense of unity
 tej najar vaale logon ne bhaanp liya tha ki modi ne kaise teji se apana haath pehle peeche khinch liya tha kyonki ve bahusnkhyakon ko bhramit karne vaala koi sanket nahin dena chaahate the
 Modi himself maintained a considerable distance from Mulayam Singh Yadav on the stage, which was also visible to the guests present there
 sapa pramukh desh ke chatur rajanetaaon main se ek maane jate hai
 Perhaps they want Modi's support to strengthen their son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 shaayad yahi baat samaj kar modi bhi unase duuri banaae rakhana chaahate hon
 But at the same time, while showing balance, he also showed that he is dependent on Muslim voters
 mulaayam singh yadav ne ek baar phir bhoomi adhigrahan vidheyak or aam bajet ke maamle main bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar kaa virodh karke is baat ke sanket de die ki ve 2017 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main apane muslim vot bank ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye kaise modi kaa virodh jari rakhenge
 Modi realizes the importance of elections in politically unstable states
 banaras se saansad hone ke naate ve kisi bhi haal main apane un bahusankhyak votaron kii andekhi bardaasht nahin kar sakate, jinhone unhen loksabhaa 2014 chunaav main vot diya tha
 Experts say that at this time Modi wants to refocus on his strongman image, which attracts all Indians
 dilli main haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaavon se nikalakar aayaa he ki aise sthaneey majboot netaaon ko party main laayaa jaae jo pradhanmantri ke vyaktigat abhiyaan ke alaava bhaajapa ko majboot karne kaa kaam kar saken
 BJP also has a big test in Bihar
 vahaan aise hi majboot netaaon ko bhagava party main laane ke liye taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Who can once again instill confidence in the people towards the 'modi wave' in the state

 Dead or Alive
 a thrilling # webseries, in which @rajkummar_rao plays Subhash Chandra Bose, completely justifies the Hero
 His makeup is commendable and looks exactly like the real person, whom we have always seen in the print media
 The background score and the rap in Bangla brings alive the revolutionary feeling
 a lot of attention has gone into the detailing
 Although, it does not tell anything that we do not know about Bose, nonetheless it manages to keep the viewers attention undisturbed

 Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) is insisting on some far-reaching administrative reforms to make governance in the state accountable and corruption-free
 20 agast ko band daravaajon main hui lambii baithak or uske agle din paanch ghante kii field visit ke baad kesiar ne rajya ke 33 jila colectoron se kaha ki prashasan ko adhik javabdeh banane ke liye vibhinn upayon ko lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Among the proposed steps is the upcoming new Revenue Bill, which promises to provide corruption-free services with greater efficiency within a time frame with transparency using information technology
 yah vidheyak jila colectoron ko vittiya aniyamittaaon yaa dhan ke durupyog karne vaale adhikariyon or nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii shakti pradaan karegaa
 KCR said, "the revenue law enacted by the British Raj is causing great harm to the public and the state
" kareeb 150 rajasav kanoonon ko badalane kii jarurat he
 "to make governance oriented, there will be a need to share the responsibilities and tasks of the district collectors and for this there is a plan to appoint their deputy
 ye adhikari mantriyon sahit jan pratinidhiyon ke pradarshan par bhi nigaraanee rakhenge
 KCR has also expressed its intention to make Telangana land-free
 rajya main bhoomi ke swaamitv se sambandhit 3,00,000 lambit maamle hai
 a day before the KCR meeting with the district collectors, the government appointed Somesh Kumar as Special Chief Secretary (revenue) and Chief Commissioner (land Administration) in place of Rajeshwar Tiwari
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kesiar ne mahasoos kiya ki tiwari ne bhoomi rajasav record main gadbaditon ko thik karne ke liye do saal pehle bahut dhoomdhaam se launch kii gai bhoomi record website dharni ko apadet karne kii disha main paryaapt prayaas nahin kiye
 Columns such as 'occupier (lessee)' and 'employer (consumer)' will be removed in the revenue records of the website so that when a landlord leases his land, there is no compromise with his ownership rights
 kesiar yah bhi chaahate hai ki gram rajasav adhikari pranali ko hataa diya jaae or us vibhaag se jude karmchaariyon ko panchayat raaj yaa krishi vibhaagon ke saath soochibaddh kiya jaae
 However, revenue staff unions fear that these changes will create an identity crisis for their department, so they are opposing it
 is bich, daagi rajasav adhikariyon par bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro (asibi) apana shikanja kasata ja rahaa he
 a senior ACB source said, "complaints of corruption come more from revenue offices dealing in high value transactions, even bribing employees by putting a second SIM in their mobile phones or calling from their drivers' phones
 Make a demand
 '' rajya ko atirikt sansaadhan jutaney kii bhi jarurat he kyonki kaleswaram lift sinchai yojana, mishan bhageerath or mishan kakatiya jaisi pramukh pariyojnaon ke liye centre se anudaan milane kii ummid nahin he
 The government is spending thousands of crores of rupees every year on these projects
 prashasnic dakshata se itar, kesiar yah bhi chahenge ki ye sudhaar unki party telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) kaa janaadhar rajya main or majboot karen
 He hopes that revenue reforms along with new panchayati raj and municipal laws will bring a lot of amenities to the public and will help TRS reach power for the third consecutive time in 2023

 aajkal khabar zoron par he ki kya aam aadmi party dilli main ek baar phir sarkaar banaaegi? zaahir si baat he 70 siton kii vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ke paas 27 vidhayak hai
 (there were 28 but one was fired by the party) to sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan congress ke aath vidhayakon kaa lenaa hoga, haalanki sankhya 36 kii honi zaruri he, lekin bijepi ke teen vidhayak kyonki ab sansad pahunch gaye hai to congress ke samarthan se sarkaar ban to sakati he
 But the story is not of this multiplication part, the story is that the performance of the Aam Aadmi Party in the Lok Sabha has been poor, all the seats in Delhi have been lost, along with Arvind Kejriwal, the bail of all the big leaders outside Delhi has been seized
 or dilli hi kii baat kar lo to yahaan 60 vidhansabha siton par bijepi ne badhat banaai jabaki aam aadmi party keval 10 main hi badhat barkaraar rakh saki
 There is a voice in the Aam Aadmi Party that we should form a government and those who are raising this voice have their reasons as well
 pehla, dilli main sarkaar chhodane kii vajah se puure desh main party se naaraazgi badi or party ke liye maahaul kharaab ho gaya, isliye is baar sarkaar banaakar apni shashan kshamta ko sabit karnaa chahie
 Secondly, Modi's air is so strong that if the assembly elections were held, the BJP might also form the government with an absolute majority here
 teesraa, party lagaataar chunaav lard rahi he or donneton dene vaale bhi kab tak apni white mani dete rahenge
 Especially when the party lost in Delhi itself and the biggest voter middle class in Delhi is chanting Namo
 chauthaa, lagaataar chunaav ladakar sab thake hue hai or walantirs kaa manobal bhi is samay gira hua he, aise main chunaav main naa jaakar sarkaar banaayi jaae or apni galati maani jaae
 But, the other faction does not agree, it says that if formed a government, what will happen to the moral ground that the party was lamenting after leaving the government for the last three months, second, how can they trust Congress because the Congress The Aam Aadmi Party has eliminated the Congress from Delhi by taking over the vote bank of the Congress and the Congress will do its best to somehow settle this party only then its establishment And left
 teesraa, ab sarkaar banane kaa sandesh ye bhi ja saktaa he ki aap ko bhi ab satta kaa laalach ho gaya he, or chauthaa is puure ghatnakram se party kii aparipakvata ek misaal ban jaaegi
 As soon as the news came out, you said that if there is no question of forming the government, then the Congress will not give any support
 ab aap ko to kya ye khabar yaheen khatm maan lee jaae? yani sarkaar nahin ban rahi dilli waalon kii? For this, we have to pay attention to the condition of the Congress dilli main vidhansabha main uske aath vidhayak hai or ab hue loksabhaa main vah ek bhi vidhansabha seat par badhat nahin bana pai
 In political circles, everyone agrees that if elections are held again in Delhi, the Congress may not win even a single seat as the Congress in Delhi has become irrelevant with only 15 per cent votes in the Lok Sabha elections
 yani uske paas aam aadmi party ko samarthan dekar uski sarkaar banavaane se badhiya koi vikalp nahin he
 Although the Aam Aadmi Party has not taken any final decision on this, the Aam Aadmi Party will like to take any step forward when the Congress wants to form the government on its own and declare that it wants to support the Aam Aadmi Party to stop the interest of the people of Delhi and the BJP
 It is that he should fulfill the promises made to the people of Delhi once again
 aap kaa apni taraf se pahal karnaa mushkil lagata he kyonki isse uski saakh par batta lag saktaa he kyonki party kaa siddhant hi gathbandhan ke liye manaa karata he or pichhali baar bhi congress ne khud hi samarthan diya tha
 If you did not ask, then how to ask for support yourself? udhar, congress bhi apni taraf se elaan nahin karnaa chaah rahi wo chaah rahi he ki aam aadmi party jhuke or khud samarthan kii maang kare
 After all, the Congress is the National Party
 itani aasaani se kaise us party ke saamne jhuk jaae jisane uske ghar se usko nikaal diya
 That is, first the game of 'AAP' and first 'congress' is going on in Delhi, which may go on for some more days
 ek patrkaar ke taur par main apana paksh nahin rakh saktaa, lekin kyonki dilli cover karata hum or hum to ek naagarik hi That is why i want to say this that at this time the people of Delhi are most in need of their elected government
 garmi kaa mausam he pani kii killat badhane lagi he, bijli ghanton gaayab rahane kii khabaren aane lagi hai, iske alaava dilli main zyaadaatar kaam There is no government and the bureaucracy dominates due to lack of government
 kul milakar dilli main koi kehane sunne vaala nahin he, sarkaar kisi kii bhi ho
 


 If there will be someone who will solve the problem, someone will listen to the public, there will be someone who will assure that your work will not be done
 agle kuch din dilli kii raajnneeti or dilli ke nagarikon ke liye ahm rahenge

 According to the information, Santu Ahirwar, who works in the spleen mill of Nogaon, was working in the mill on Sunday
 usee dauraan wo bijli kii taar kii chapet main aa gaya, jisase uski maukey par hi maut ho gai
 Death of a laborer caught in CCTV The entire incident was captured in front-facing CCTV cameras
 ghatana ke dauraan wo ek-ek kar ke vahaan rakhi polithine uthaa rahaa tha
 As soon as he proceeded to lift the last placed polyethylene, he was struck by an electric wire
 isse uski ghatnasthal par hi maut ho gai
 Since the accident, the mill owner is being told that someone had told Santu that there is no current in the line
 isliye usne yah jokhim bharaa kadam uthaaya
 On the other hand, soon after the information about the death of the laborer, Sanjay Taneja, the operator of Tilly Mill, went missing

 The letter of a Naga monk remains a matter of discussion in the political and administrative corridors of Chhattisgarh
 is chitthee ne rajya ke diaiji jail ke
 K
 gupta ko mushkil main daal diya he
 Actually, Naga Sadhu wrote a letter to Gupta for reading Hanuman Katha in 5 Central Jails of Chhattisgarh
 is chitthee ko padhakar gupta bahut khush hue ki isse kaidiyon ko prerana milegi or unke aacharan main sudhaar aayega
 At the same time, the prisoners will be released from jail by becoming good citizens
 gupta ne iske baad naga sadhu ko jail main hanuman katha ke liye anumati de di
 The DIG jail also made it clear to Naga Sadhu that Katha reading will be free, as there is no budget provision for such programs
 lekin naga sadhu ko yah shart pasand nahin ai
 Giving him permission to jail administration in such a way that he went through so much that he knocked the door even to the Chief Minister's Secretariat
 naga sadhu ne jail main hone vaali prayek hanuman katha ke liye dhai lakh rupee kaa paarishramik tay kiya he
 Apart from this, it is also said that the jail administration will also have to pay the amount spent for distribution of bhajan mandali, sangat and prasad during the story
 naga sadhu kii is maang par diaiji jail gupta pasopesh main he
 On the one hand, he does not want to annoy the Naga Sadhu, on the other hand, he has a problem that there is no provision of budget from the government for organizing 'hanuman Katha'
 is saare kisse kii shuruyaat hui 16 oktober ko hui
 Naga Sadhu Umeshdas Nirmohi, who lives in Mardana village of Samvad tehsil of Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh, sent a letter to the DIG jail
 is chitthee main raipur, bilaspur, ambikapur, durg or jagadalpur jelon main 9 divasiy hanuman katha vaachan kaa prastaav diya gaya
 Naga Sadhu Nirmohi has written a letter to the Chief Minister's Secretariat to propose a budget for Katha reading, after being told by the DIC jail that there is no budget for Hanuman Katha
 chitthee main naga sadhu ne likhaa he ki agar advance dakshina or anya samagriyon kii maang puri nahin hui to katha kaa aayojan sambhav nahin hoga
 In a letter to the Chief Minister's Secretariat, Naga Sadhu wrote, 'I am a sadhu with a numismatism
 chunki aayojan 9 din tak roj teen ghante sangitamay evam suvyavasthit manch par hota he
 At least five performers make arrangements for music, a companion for worship and two servicemen of food, clothes etc
 kul 9 or 10 log saath hote he to unki gruhasthi nickshulk kaise chal sakati he? behatar ho jail praangan main katha ke liye uchit manch banaaya jaae
 Arrange for mixer and micasound
 pratidin koi na koi adhikari sapatnik puja or aarti ke dauraan upasthit rahe
 Prasad of that day should also be distributed on his behalf
 pradesh main paanch jail hai, isliye kab, kis jail main katha hogi, uske liye roster bana liye jaae
 Two and a half lakh rupees will have to be paid for each story
 is dhai lakh main ek lakh agrim bhugtan aath din pehle dena hoga
 It would be better for the government to set a budget for the story in jail and hand it over to the jail department
 'philhal mukhyamantri sachivalay ko naga sadhu kii ye chitthee mil chuki he
 Due to no provision of rules, this letter has been captured in the files
 naga sadhu ko lagata he kichhattisgarh membijapi sarkaar lagaataar teen vidhansabha chunaav jeet kar satta main he, isliye katha vaachan ke liye bajet taiyaar karne main use koi dikkt nahin honi chahie
 However, Naga Sadhu is not aware of the fact that State Chief Minister Raman Singh has run to Delhi many times due to economic crisis
 yahi nahin vitt prabandhan ke liye kai baar rajya sarkaar ko apni pratibhuti bechney kii naubat bhi aa chuki he

 "during this journey from a lamp light in a small village in Bengal to a sparkling light in Delhi, i have seen vast and somewhat incredible changes
 " desh ke 13wein raashtrapati ke rup main shapath lene ke baad apane bhaashan main ye udgaar pranab mukherjee ne vyakt kiye
 He said, i was a child at that time when a famine in Bengal killed millions
 vah pidaa or dukh main bhuulaa nahin hum
 Pranab, who often swam across the river to go to school, achieved many milestones by getting up from the ground and today finally became the highest citizen of the country
 satta ke galiyaaron main unhen sankatmochak kaha jaataa tha
 He was known for his acceptance across the border of administrators and parties
 vah pehali baar 1969 main rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye
 Once he went to the Rajya Sabha, he did not go public and fought elections for many years
 siyaasi jindagi main kareeb 35 saal baad unhone loksabhaa kaa rukh kiya
 In 2004, he was elected for the first time from Jangipur parliamentary constituency in West Bengal
 2009 main bhi vah loksabhaa pahunche
 Immediately after Pranab resigned from the post of Finance Minister on 26 June, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote a letter to him thanking him for his contribution to the government and said that his lack will always be felt in the government
 sarkaar ke mantriyon ne bhi unki kami khalane kii baat kahi
 Pranab missed out on becoming the Prime Minister many times, but in spite of not being in this important post, everybody looked at him only in the time of crisis
 80 ke dashak main pradhanmantri pad kii hasarat kaa izhaar karne ke baad unhone congress se alag hokar nai party banaai
 Later he again came to the Congress and went on to touch political heights
 arthvyavastha se lekar videsh maamalon par paini pakad rakhane vaale pranab babu ne sarkaar main rahete hue kamartod mehnat kii or aaj vah der raat tak apane kaam main vyast rahete hai
 Pranab is now holding the top constitutional post of the country after getting his fun iron in the corridors of politics
 jaahir he sarkaar or raajnneeti main unke 45 saal ke anubhav kaa koi sani nahin he
 Although he may not have been an established lawyer, he repeatedly held the iron of his understanding and hold on the Constitution, economy and foreign relations
 pranab siyasat kii har karavat ko bakhubi samajhate rahe hai
 This is the reason that whenever there was trouble on his party and the current UPA government, he appeared at the forefront
 kai baar to aisa laga ki sarkaar kii har marz kii dawa pranab babu hi hai
 Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao gave him the post of Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission in 1991 along with making him Foreign Minister
 tippaniyan In Manmohan's government, he held the posts of Defense Minister, Foreign Minister and Finance Minister
 pranab ke pita kinkar mukherjee bhi congress ke netaa hua karte the
 Pranah also practiced for some time and also spent some time in the field of journalism and education
 iske baad unka siyaasi safar shuru hua
 Rashtrapati Bhavan is the most important address in the country, which is associated with the name of the first citizen of India
 desh ke jis aaleeshaan bhawan main rahane kaa gaurav pratham naagarik ko miltaa he, uski bhavyata kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki chaar manjila is bhawan main 340 kamare hai or sabhi kamaron kaa upyog kisi na kisi rup main kiya ja rahaa he
 Rashtrapati Bhavan, built in about two lakh square feet, used to be the official residence of the British Viceroy before independence
 kareeb 70 karod iton or 30 lakh ghan foot pathar se bane is bhawan ke nirmaan main us vakt 1
 40 crores was spent
 unhone kaha, us samay main baccha tha, jab bengal main akaal ne lakhon logon ko maar daalaa tha
 i have not forgotten that suffering and sorrow
 skool jane ke liye aksar nadi tairkar paar karne vaale pranab ne jameen se uthakar kai mukaam hasil kiye or aaj antat: desh ke sarvocch naagarik ban gaye
 They were called troublemakers in the corridors of power
 prashaasak or dalon kii seemaa ke paar apni sweekaaryata ke liye vah mashhoor rahe
 He was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1969
 ek baar rajyasabha kii ore gaye, to kai varshon tak janata ke bich jaakar chunaav nahin ladaa
 He turned to the Lok Sabha after nearly 35 years in political life
 2004 main vah pehali baar pashchim bengal ke jangipur sansadeey kshetra se chune gaye
 He also reached the Lok Sabha in 2009
 beete 26 june ko vittamantri pad se pranab ke istipha dene ke tatkaal baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne unhen patr likhakar sarkaar main unke yogadan ke liye aabhaar jataayaa or kaha ki unki kami sarkaar main hameshaa mahasoos kii jaaegi
 The ministers of the government also talked about their lack
 pranab pradhanmantri banane se kai baar chuke, lekin is mahatvapurn pad par na hote hue bhi sankat ke samay sabhi log unki ore hi dekhte the
 After declaring the prime ministerial status in the 80s, he broke away from the Congress to form a new party
 baad main vah phir se congress main aae or siyaasi bulandiyon ko choote chale gaye
 Pranab Babu, who keeps a close vigil on everything from economy to foreign affairs, worked tirelessly while in government and today he is busy with his work till late night
 raajnneeti ke galiyaaron main apane fan kaa loha manwaane ke baad pranab ab desh ke sheersh sanvaidhanik pad par asin hai
 Obviously, his 45 years of experience in government and politics is unmatched
 bhale hi vah ek sthapit vakil na rahe hon, lekin samvidhan, arthvyavastha or videshi sambandhon kii apni samaj or pakad kaa loha unhone baar-baar manvaaya
 Pranab has been understanding every situation of politics very well
 yahi vajah rahi ki jab bhi unki party or maujuuda upie sarkaar par musiibat ai, to vah sabase aage najar aae
 At times it seemed that Pranab Babu is the medicine of every merger of the government
 pradhanmantri pivi narsingh raav ne 1991 main unhen videshmantri banane ke saath hi yojana ayog kaa upaadhyaksh kaa pad diya
 The comments manmohan kii sarkaar main vah rakshaamantri, videshmantri or vittamantri ke padon par rahe
 Pranab's father Kinkar Mukherjee was also a Congress leader
 kuch vakt ke liye pranah ne vakaalat bhi kii or iske saath hi patrakarita evam shiksha kshetra main bhi kuch vakt bitaayaa

 There is a very shocking case in America
 america main do logon ko sirf isliye ek saath maut kii sajaa de di gai, kyonki jahrile injection kii expyri date behad kareeb thi
 The petition of these prisoners in Arkansas province jail was rejected by the court on Monday itself
 saal 2000 ke baad pehali baar america main ek saath do logon ko maut kii sajaa di gai he
 According to Newsweek, 52-year-old Jack Jones was convicted of murder and rape
 marcel williams (46) ko dushkarm maamle main sajaa hui thi
 Both were sentenced to death in the 1990s
 jones ko shaam 7:06 baje injection lagaaya gaya
 He was declared dead around 14 minutes later
 iske teen ghante baad williams ko mrit ghoshit kiya gaya
 The government of Arkansas wanted to sentence eight prisoners to death within 11 days
 inamen se teen ko sajaa di ja chuki he
 But four have got relief from the High Court
 arkansaas ke governor aasa hachinson ne kaha ki maut kii sajaa jaldi dena isliye jaruri he kyonki jahrile injection ke saath di jane vaali behoshee kii dawa 30 april ko khatm ho jaaegi
 After that he is unlikely to meet
 ab 27 april ko duusare kaidi ko maut di jaaegi
 It is known that to punish the death by poison injection, three medicines have to be given
 behoshee ke liye midazolam, saans rokane ke liye vecuronium or dil kii dhadkan band karne ke liye teesri dawa
 Midazolam is only until 30 April
 companiyaan chaahati hai ki unki banaai dawa se kisi kii maut na ho
 The Supreme Court is also strict in this matter
 is kaaran companiyon ne in dawaaon kaa prodection band kar diya he
 The expiry dates of medicines which are present in the market are also close

 dawa kii kami se is par amal nahin ho rahaa he
 Now state electric chairs are considering another option like firing squad

 Jones was injected at 7:06 pm
 kareeb 14 minute baad use mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Three hours later Williams was pronounced dead
 arkansaas kii sarkaar 11 din ke bheetar aath kaidiyon ko maut kii sajaa dena chaahati thi
 Three of these have been punished

 Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said that it is necessary to give the death penalty early because the anesthesia given with toxic injections will end on April 30
 iske baad uske milane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Now on April 27, another prisoner will be put to death
 maaloom ho ki jahrile injection se maut kii sajaa dene ke liye teen dawaaen deni hoti hai

 ' raja-rajavaadon par paresh rawal ke bayaan se karani sena kii tyoriyaan chadh gai hai
 The Karni Sena has written a letter to BJP President Amit Shah expressing displeasure over Paresh Rawal's statement
 isamen sena ne bhaajapa se kaha he ki wo khud paresh rawal ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karaae
 Along with this, the Army has said that the party should clear its stand on his statement while showing the way out to Paresh Rawal
 paresh rawal desh ke 566 raja-rajavaadon ke vaarison se press conferes karke maafee maangen
 The BJP leaders warned against the opposition of the candidates, warning that if the BJP did not do so, then the Rajput Samaj Party would oppose all the candidates
 karani sena ne kaha he ki paresh rawal ke bayaan se rajput samaaj kii bhavanaaen aahat hui hai
 So strict steps should be taken against them at the earliest
 ye bayaan he vivaad kii jadgauratlab he ki shanivaar ko rajkot main bhaajapa saansad paresh rawal ne ek sabha ko sambodhit karte huevivaadit bayaande diya tha
 Later on realizing this, he immediately apologized
 paresh rawal ne bhaashan ke dauraan sardaar patel kaa zikr kiya
 He said that Patel had united the country
 ye raja-rajavaade, jo bandar the, unako sahi kiya tha, sidhaa kiya tha
 Not much was written about Patel, while JRD Tata also said that if Sardar Patel had been his prime minister, where would the country have reached? kshatriya samaaj ne kiya virohparesh rawal ke is vivaadit bayaan se rajkot kaa kshatriya samudaay virodh main utar aayaa
 He was announced to burn effigies of Paresh Rawal
 soshal media par bhi paresh rawal kaa virodh shuru ho gaya
 Seeing the growing opposition to the apology, the BJP had to immediately call a press conference and change the statement from Paresh Rawal
 saansad paresh rawal ne maafee maangate huai kaha ki yah jo baat maine baat kahi he, vah hyderabad ke nizaam ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kahi he
 The Rajputs have not said
 rajput to hamaare desh ke gaurav hai
 Rajpujas like Krishna Kumar Gohel, who climbed up and supported Patel
 paresh ne aage kaha ki aise logon ke liye or aisi kaum ke liye hamaare munh se aise shabd kabhi nahin niklenge

 Is the era of petrol and diesel cars coming to an end? Will your next car be an electric car? This is what the government wants, so Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made announcements in the budget to promote the purchase of electric vehicles
 electric vaahanon kii kharid par tex ab 12 pratishat se ghataakar 5 pratishat kar diya gaya he
 People who buy electric cars and e-bikes will benefit
 lekin modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa phayda sirf bharatiyon ko nahin milegaa, balki puri duniya par iskaa asar hone vaala he
 In fact, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change aims to reduce the average temperature of the entire world to 2 ° C
 ek International Energy Agency ke anusaar is lakshya ko puraa karne ke liye 2040 tak duniya ko 60 karod electric gadiyon kii jarurat hogi or in gadiyon kaa ek bahut bada hissaa bharat main maujuud hoga
 India ranks third in the world in terms of oil consumption
 aise main agar bharat main electric gadiyon kaa jamaana aata he to duniya kii iconomi badal jaaegi
 Changing economy like an electric car can also change the economy of your home
 maan lijie ki aap petrol se chalane vaali car kaa istemaal karte hai
 The average of your car is 15 kilometers per liter and if you cover a distance of 50 kilometers every day, then you will spend around Rs 84 thousand 350 petrol in a year
 lekin agar aapke paas electric car ho to aap ek saal main kareeb 1825 unit bijli kharch karenge or 5 rupee prati unit ke hisaab se iskaa kul kharch hoga 9 hajaar 125 rupee
 That is, petrol car will cost four and a half rupees per kilometer while electric car will cost 50 paise per kilometer
 is tarah ek saal main aap kam se kam 70 hajaar rupee kii bachat kar sakate hai
 The entire calculation is based on the cost of a small petrol-powered car
 agar aap SUV chalaate hai yaa koi or badi car chalaate hai to phir aapaki bachat or zyada hogi
 That is, soon you will get many options in the e-car market
 abhi to aapaki selary kaa ek bada hissaa petrol or dijal kharidne main kharch ho jaataa hoga
 But in the next few years, this precious oil will be of no use because the price of petrol is going to be gradually found in the soil
 stanoard uniwarsity kii reportstnoard uniwarsity ke Economist Tony Seba ne ek report taiyaar kii he
 Which is titled 'rethinking Transportation'
 is report main bataaya gaya he ki puri duniya kii Petroleum industry saal 2030 tak khatm hone kii sthiti main pahunch jaaegi kyonki electric kaaron kaa daur Transportation ko puri tarah se badalakar rakh degaa
 For this reasoning has been given that in today's era, the life of cars running on petrol and diesel is about 3 lakh kilometers
 jabaki electric kaaron kii Life 16 lakh kilometre hogi
 Because of this, in the coming time people will start buying electric cars
 ye badlaav isliye hoga kyonki electric car par aane vaala kharch petrol or dijal car ke mukaable 10 guna sasta hoga
 Electric trains have 18 to 25 moving parts
 jabaki petrol or dijal se chalane vaali gadiyon main 2 hajaar se zyada Moving parts hote hai
 In such a way, electric cars will become Maintenance Free in a way
 is arthshaastri ke mutabik 2022 tak saamaanya electric kaaron kii Range 300 kilometre ke paar chali jaaegi or unki keemat bhi gir jaaegi
 Thereafter, sales of these cars will increase
 is trend par bhi bharat kii najar he or isiilie is baar bajet main electric kaaron par jor diya gaya he

 bihar congress main foot kii charchaa aajkal joro par he, lekin usase zyada charchaa ab is baat ko lekar hone lagi he ki kya bihar congress ko lalu prasad yadav chalaa rahe hai? ye baat isliye uthi kyonki bihar ke pehle mukhyamantri shrikrishna singh kii jayanti ke avasar par ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha, jiske mukhya atithi argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav the
 Lalu's advice to Congress leaders was not supported by the State Congress Committee
 mukhya atithi ke taur par bolte hue lalu prasad yadav ne congress ke netaaon se kaha ki wo aapas main jhagadna chode or party ke liye miljul kar kaam karen
 Lalu Yadav said it well, but some Congress leaders did not like it
 unhone kaha ki lalu prasad yadav ko kya jarurat thi congress ke andruni maamalon main dakhal dene kii
 Lalu's intervention in Congress for 20 years! However, those who say this may not know that RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav's interference in Bihar Congress is not from today but has been going on continuously for 20 years
 agar pichhlaa itihaas dekha jaye to bihar main congress ke patan kaa yah pramukh kaaran bhi rahaa he
 In 1990, Lalu Prasad Yadav wrested power from the Congress, but there was not a single attempt from the Congress to achieve the glory of that power in these 27 years
 yahi vajah he ki congress yahaan lagbhag pangu ban ke rah gai he
 Congress was the main opposition party in Bihar 27 years ago, to understand this matter, we have to go 27 years ago
 1990 main congress bihar main vidhansabha kaa chunaav haar gai
 Former Chief Minister Dr
 jagannatha mishra ke netritv main ek majboot vipaksh ke taur par congress vidhansabha main 72 vidhayakon ke saath maujuud thi
 Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Chief Minister
 1990 se 1995 kaa daur bihar main saamaajik parivartan kaa daur mana jaataa he kyonki pehali baar pichhadi jatiyon kii bhagidaari satta main prachur maatra main thi
 Lalu became stronger
 
 
 congress kamajoris dauraan congress ne apni pragati ke liye khoi hui garima ko waapas paane kaa koi prayaas hi nahin kiya
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was initially considered as a weak Chief Minister, got stronger day by day and Congress got weaker day by day
 congress kii kamajori kaa ye alam ho gaya he ki ab use bihar main raajnneeti karne ke liye sahare kii jarurat padane lagi he
 The seat was reduced to 29 in the 1995 assembly and due to the strong emergence of the Samata Party and BJP in the 1996 Lok Sabha, its condition began to thin in the Lok Sabha as well
 jab seetaram kesari ne milaayaa lalu se haath1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress bihar kii 54 siton main se keval 3 siten hi jeet pai thi
 This was a very embarrassing situation for the party, but in 1998 Congress President Sitaram Kesri joined Lalu Prasad Yadav to improve the party's position
 1998 kaa loksabhaa chunaav congress or argedy ne milakar ladaa
 The condition of the Congress was ridiculous in 1999, Lalu Prasad Yadav left only 8 seats for the Congress out of 54 seats in United Bihar
 yahi se congress kaa prabhaav teji se kam hone laga
 Out of these 8 seats, the Congress won four, but the 1999 Lok Sabha election was limited when the Congress contested 13 seats, out of which 8 were under friendly agreement with RJD and 5 were in friendly fight
 lekin jeet mili sirf 2 par
 Now the condition of the Congress could be gauged from this
 abtak lalu prasad yadav par chaara ghotaale kaa aarope lag chukaa tha, sibiai ne jaanch shuru kar di thi
 After this humiliating situation, the Congress fought alone in the year 2000, again raised self-respect in the Congress and decided to contest alone in the 2000 assembly elections
 tark ye diya gaya ki lalu prasad yadav bhrasht hai un par ghotaale kaa aarope he
 Earlier, the Congress had contested the 1998 and 1999 Lok Sabha elections along with Lalu Prasad Yadav despite being accused of fodder scam
 khayr 2000 main vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne 23 siten jiti
 Neither did Lalu's corruption, the Rabri government formed a government under the leadership of Rabari Devi, then the Congress joined the same government which had contested the election alleging corruption
 2004 kaa loksabhaa chunaav congress ne argedy or ram vilaas paswan ke saath milakar ladaa tha, jisamen congress ne 4 siten jiti
 The UPA government was formed at the center
 lekin bihar se argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kaa hi varchasv rahaa
 Paswan became a new ally with Lalu, in 2005 Bihar assembly elections were held twice, but look at the strategy of the Congress, he contested from different coalitions both times
 ek baar ramvilas paswan kii party lokjanshkti ke saath gathbandhan kiya to duusari baar lalu prasad yadav kii party argedy se
 In which Congress got 10 seats
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke sahyog se bihar main endie kii sarkaar banaai
 Lalu and Paswan gave only 4 seats! What is the story of that? In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan gave only 4 seats to the Congress while in the UPA government
 congress main thodaa swabhimaan jagaa usne ise lene se inkaar kar diya
 The Congress swept the polls alone and won 2 seats
 2010 kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi congress ne akele ladaa tab use 4 siten mili
 Then in 2014, the Congress high command felt that it cannot run alone
 to phir lalu prasad yadav se haath mila liya
 This time the Congress got 12 seats as coalition, out of which the Congress won 2 seats
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main argedy congress ke saath-saath nitish kumaar kii party bhi mahagathbandhan main shaamil hui tab congress ko 41 siten ladane ko mili tab usne 27 siton par jeet pai jo 1995 ke baad sabase zyada siten thi
 'when wanted, like wanted, used Congress', this is the account of the last 27 years of Congress
 isamen ye jaananaa mushkil nahin he ki congress par lalu prasad yadav kaa kitna prabhaav rahaa he
 Lalu Prasad Yadav used the Congress when he wanted
 koshish congress kii taraf se bhi hui lekin un koshishon kii vajah se congress kai baar expoj ho gai
 Like the 2000 Legislative Assembly election
 lalu ke khilaaf chuppi saadhe rahi congress1990 se lekar 1995 tak congress bihar kii pramukh vipakshi dal thi, lekin us dauraan congress ne lalu prasad yadav ke khilaaf koi andolan khadaa nahin kiya
 She stood in a corner somewhere in the circle of Mandal
 congress ne virodh pradarshan tak nahin kiya na kisi mudde par bihar band kaa elaan kiya
 As a result, the BJP emerged as the main opposition party in Bihar in 1995 and later came to power with Nitish Kumar
 aise main ye sawaal to bilkul bemaani he ki lalu prasad yadav bihar congress ko chalaa rahe hai

 ab congress kii mushkil ye he ki wo mulaayam ko saathi maane yaa phir virdohi
 The Congress cannot openly say anything against Mulayam as he is running the government with the help of Mulayam's crutches

 darasal unhone ek twit kiya tha, jisamen unhone Innovation ko Innivation likh diya tha
 After which some users understood the new word and started looking for meanings, while many users also made some funny tweets about the mistake
 haalanki ab unhone is galati ko apane hi andaaj main sudhaar liya or uske baad twit kar diya
 He considered the use of Indovation in place of Innovation even better

 Earlier, Tharoor made a tweet promoting his new book written on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media on Wednesday
 apni pustak kaa zikr karte hue unhone angreji shabd‘fluoxinocinihilipeliphication'kaa istemaal kiya, jiske baad soshal media par unka majaak udne laga
 The much-awaited Land Acquisition Bill can be discussed and voted in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 'bhoomi adhigrahan main svachh muaavja evam paardarshita, punarvaas evam punarsthaapan vidheyak 2012' ke naam se yah vidheyak loksabhaa se paarit ho chukaa he
 The Lok Sabha had 216 votes in favor and 19 in opposition
 tippaniyan a government release said on Tuesday that the bill hinges on consent, compensation and rehabilitation through a three-pillar broadly defined process
 gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne loksabhaa ko vidheyak paarit hone ke purv aashwaasan diya tha ki is vidheyak main rajya sarkaron ko unki jaruraton ke hisaab se lagu karne kii paryaapt vyavastha kii gai he
 He had said, "in our view this (bill) is a middle way

 " In the name of 'clean Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill 2012', this bill has been passed by Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main vidheyak ke paksh main 216 or virodh main 19 mat pade the
 The comments ek sarkari vijyapti main mangalvaar ko bataaya gaya he ki yah vidheyak teen mukhya stambhon vyapak paribhaashit prakriya ke jariye sahmati, muaavja or punarvaas par tikaa he
 Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh had assured the Lok Sabha before the passage of the bill that adequate arrangements have been made in this bill to implement the state governments according to their needs
 unhone kaha tha, "hamaari najar main yah (vidheyak) ek madhyam maarg he

 " Rahul Gandhi, who was trying to handle the political legacy of the Congress vice-president and the nehru-gandhi family, spoke to the Dalit leaders of the party on Tuesday
 is dauraan party saansad or essi kamishan ke mukhiya piel puniya bhi the
 Rahul talked about politics, Dalits, UP and during this time he emphasized on the words brother and systematically to change the whole system
 unhone kaha ki mujhe to pataa hi nahin tha ki jati kya hoti he
 He said that in every party, a handful of people decide the tickets, run the system, whereas there should be lakhs instead
 tippanee or vishleshan baad main, aap philhal padhein kya kaha rahul gandhi ne nai dilli ke constitution club main die is bhaashan mensbase pehle sunaaya ek kissajab bhi main upi jaataa hum, mujhe koi skool dikhataa he, to main koshish karata hum ki bacchon se, teacher se baat karun
 At that time, Mayawati ji was in government
 to mere teen sawaal hua karte the
 Used to go to school jo aage vaali line hoti thi
 i used to ask their children's names
 jo peeche vaali line hoti thi, unke bacchon ke naam poochta tha
 And the teacher used to ask two questions
 aapkaa topper koun he, sabase wyk student koun hai
 In ninety percent of schools, i tell you the answer
 agali line main dalit baccha kabhi nahin dikhaa, jo peeche vaali line hoti thi, isamen zyada se zyada dalit bachche dikhte the
 This is reality
 teacher se poochta topper koun he, to aage kii line
 The back line if not doing a good job
 phir main poochta ki bhaiya ek baat bataaie ki agar dalit bachche pichhali line main hai or aap mujhe kah rahi hai ki pichhali line se koi brit student nahin nikal rahaa he, to isamen aapmen koi kami to nahin he, shaayad aapane katigari bana lee ki inako aage bithaungi
 Behind them
 jo aage baith rahe hai, unhen zyada sunai degaa
 Punia ji says that there are two types of schools
 meraa kahana he ki skool ke andar bhi do tareeke hai
 It is a matter of discrimination, not of Dalits
 200 log tay karte hai puure desh kii raajnneetith saal se nau saal se main raajnneeti main hum
 i go to every state, watch elections
 jab hamaara loksabhaa kaa, vidhansabha kaa chunaav hota he, kitne log faisla lete hai
 How many people decide who brother will go to Lok Sabha, who will go to assembly, who will become PM
 hindustan kii aabaadi kitni he
 60-70 percent of them vote, about 100 million people dispose
 mujhe tikat disijan bhi dikhte he, candidet chunane kaa disijan bhi dikhataa he
 Now tell me how many people will be there if we add all the parties in Hundustan
 aapane kaha ki 10 karod vot dete hai, to candidet chunane kaa faisla kitne log karte hai, bolie bolie
 In India, even in my party, if you spoke too much, 100 people
 bijepi main 70-80 log, bispi main ek vyakti, sapa main teen log, bijedy main do log
 Two hundred people in the total system, three hundred people, 500 people decide the political future of this country if you openly speak
 main aapako sidhaa bataa detaa hum ki jab tak ye 500 log faisla lenge tab tak daliton kii aawaaj sahi dhang se na loksabhaa main pahonchegi, na vidhansabha main
 The question comes to my mind that there is a BSP government in UP, but even then one person chooses four hundred people
 to movement daliton kii hui
 Kanshi Ram ji fought
 or phir dhaancha band ho gaya
 There was a time when Rajiv used to remember Rajiv on the pretext of phone and PCO when MP and MLA used to decide the telephone
 aapako yaad hoga ki bhaiya kota hota tha
 An MP used to say that i will give this telephone to 500 people
 parmaar ji (saath main manch par baithe ek netaa) us samay mobile nahin khaid sakate the
 The MLA had to go with folded hands
 kya badla, aaj ye inaki mej par padaa he mobile phone
 Where did it come from isko yahaan pisio laayaa
 Rajiv Gandhi, who was earlier in the hands of MP MLA, brought it to the village through PCO
 jab pisio aayaa, tab main kahata hum ki hindustan ko communication ritis mili
 Earlier it was only with the MP and MLA
 yahi ab rajnatik system main ho rahaa he
 200-400 people decide who will become a candidate
 sachhee political ritis na aam aadmi ko milti he, na dalit ko milti he
 The chosen few get
 isko chalange karne kaa tarika 73wein or 74wein sanshodhan main he, jawaab yahaan se nikalegaa
 The closed-door election decisions will not work
 We talk about the right to food, it is a big thing
 rojgaar yojana badi cheez he
 Gave RTI sab rajnatik dalon se puch lijie
 To whom do you give political rights in your party? aap tikat kaa faisla lete ho, kis kis ke paas ritis hai
 No party can answer you
 ek party nahin hindustan main, agar hamen raajnneeti ko 21veen sadi main le janaa he, to ye 200 ko 500, 1000 or phir ek lakh tak le janaa he
 Closed rooms where ticket decisions are to be opened
 ye main baat he, baaki sab periferi par he
 Till these doors do not open, political rights will not really be available
 dalit par main thodaa focus karnaa chahta hum, jab system band hota he, to sabase zyada dabaav sabase kamjor par padataa he
 a person who is powerful can enter his / her way in a closed system, but which is not so, it becomes very difficult for him / her
 mere parivaar main jati kii baat nahin hoti thimain jati main yakeen nahin karata
 Because i think that people are one
 mere parivaar main jati kii baat pehle hoti hi nahin thi
 i did not know
 kyonki meri daadi ke liye, mere papa ke liye, mere pardada ke liye sab log ek jaise the
 His thinking was that a brother is a person, he has a capacity, it happens in Dalits, it happens in other people, it does not matter
 rielity ye he ki dalit main, obisi main, kshamta main koi fark nahin he
 That's why she told the story of the school
 usamen aap bachche ko anfere treetment de rahe hai
 Has sat back
 phir baad main kah rahe hai ki ye thik se pard nahin paa rahaa he
 Then saying that the result is not coming right
 to meraa kahana he ki kami kya dikhti he mujhe
 Dalit leadership is needed at every level
 upi main aap mujhe paanch daliton ke naam bataa dijie jo netaa hai
 i hear the same name
 mayawati ji
 
 
 The second name is not heard
 agar ham upi kii baat karen to line lag jaae
 He is the leader in this block
 is jile main ye darjan netaa hai
 These are in this village
 unhen ham sistametic ritis den
 If you work in Panchayat and are in Congress, then you will get these rights
 ye nahin ki mujhe laga ki puniya ji acha kaam kar rahe hai, to aage badha diya
 i felt that if no one else was working, i turned back
 isse nuksaan hota he, jab tak neeche se nahin uthaaenge, tab tak baat nahin banane vaali
 Whatever i talk about in the system, i think we should talk about the right, the political leader is there, he works, what is his voice in the division
 sistameticli
 So this is me trying to come in slowly
 pehle dalit congress ko dabaakar saport karte theaap log dalit leadership ho, capeble log ho
 And let me talk about Congress now
 to sistameticli aapaki aawaaj congress main nahin aati, ek ek karke aati he, aapane kisi se baat kar lee
 Many senior leaders are sitting, but do not know institutionally
 main chahta hum aapaki baat aae to indivijuel par na aae community ke basis par aae
 Then you will really benefit from the power you have, and those who are from the depressed class will find that brother is talking here, hearing is being heard
 15-20, 25 saal pahel congress party ko dalit varg dabaakar saport karata tha
 Backbone used to be the Congress, i want that after 5-8 years from now, Dalits will feel that we are the backbone of the Congress party
 or ye feel karne ke liye unhen nahin badalanaa he, hamen badalanaa he
 We will never convince them that you are our backbone, brother
 agar hamaare faisle main, sanghathan main wo sachmuch main bakabon nahin hai
 i do not want to do this work only for Dalits
 main jo kamjor community hai
 See, there is talk of Dalits, there is a Dalit woman sitting here
 unke upar dalit kaa bhed hota he, phir mahila kaa hota he, to dabl hota he
 Fifty percent of women, too, are from disadvantaged sections
 to meri soch he ki jo kamjor he
 We add them and put their voice in the Lok Sabha, in the Assembly, systematically, this is my attempt

 That is why former South African captain Graeme Smith has said openly that he is 'nervous' about the Indian tour of South Africa and believes that the challenge is not easy for the Proteas
 do oktober se shuru hone vaali gandhi-mandela cricket siries se pehle hi purv captain greem smith ne jo ishaara kiya he, usase bhartiya team utsahit ho sakati he
 However, Smith's talk also means that the South African team is not taking the Indian team lightly and will come with separate preparations for this tour
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki dakshin africa ne apni team main li se hatakar teen spinneron ko jagah di he
 Leg-spinner Imran Tahir (16 Test-43 wickets), off-spinner Dan Pitt (1 Test-8 wickets and 183 wickets in 52 first class matches) and off-spinner Simon Harmer (3 Test-10 wickets, 66 first class-242 wickets) Taking advantage of Indian pitches can prove to be the hero of your team
 lekin in teenon spinner ke paas kul milakar 25 test kaa anubhav bhi nahin he
 In such a situation, the count of r Ashwin (28 Tests - 145 wickets), leg-spinner Amit Mishra (16 Tests - 58 wickets) and Harbhajan Singh (103 Tests - 417 wickets) is certainly huge
 ye gendbaaj yakeenan protiyaaj ballebaajon ke liye badi chunauti sabit ho sakate hai
 That is why on the 72-day india-south African tour that starts next month, Graeme Smith has said that he is 'nervous' and also said that the tour will not be easy
 smith ne bayaan diya he, "main nervas hum
 South Africa faces a tough challenge for India and later England
 yah vakt hamaari team kii disha tay kar saktaa he
 " smith kaa maananaa he ki duniya kii number ek team ke liye bharat main hone vaale chaar test maichon kii siries aasaan nahin hogi
 He believes that during this time the team will have to travel a lot and the conditions will not be easy
 iske alaava unhone jor diya he ki bharat main spinners trek par khelnaa mehmaan team ke liye badi chunauti sabit ho sakati he
 South Africa had to play a 2 Test series draw with the recently emerging Bangladesh team
 aise hi 2008 or 2010 main bharat ke khilaaf bhi do test maichon kii siries drow rahi thi
 The big thing in South Africa's favor is that since 2007, they have not lost in any Test series abroad
 tippaniyan Since 2007, South Africa has played 13 Test series on the overseas pitch, winning 10 and drawing 3 series
 aise main dakshin africa team ek shandaar record ke saath team india ke saamne chunauti pesh karegi
 But do you remember the victory chariot of the Australian cricket team in 2001, when the World Champion team had the desire to set a record in India after winning 15 Tests and what happened then became the golden history of Indian cricket? Africa will just have to be careful here

 Ugly is known for the infamous Chaco murder case
 tab ye khooni 38 varsh kaa tha
 It has been dodging the police ever since
 3 dashak pehle mavelikaar nyaayik magistrate ne giraftaar warrent jari kiya tha
 This work was entrusted to the Crime Branch of CID
 ek baar phir se arest warrent jari kiya gaya he 
 This is the longest running case in the judicial history of Kerala

 The incident was done on 22 January 1984 for insurance money
 allpuj jile ke mavelikara kii
 a man saw an ambassador car burning near here late at night
 usne turant aas-paas ke laagon ko ikhtala kiya
 People immediately ran towards that place
 lekin tab tak us car main baitha aadmi jal kar apana dam tod chukaa tha
 Earlier the deceased was considered ugly
 lekin post-mortem ke dauraan sach saamne aayaa ki laash kisi or kii he
 After which investigation started to find out the true identity of the deceased
 mritak kii asli pahachanpulice ko shaq hua ki kahin kurup ne kisi hatya ko anjaam to nahin diya
 After which the deceased's real housemates were traced
 marane vaale kaa naam chaako tha
 The Kerala police has since been searching for the ugly
 samay-samay par maharashtra, bihar, dilli, upi, madhya pradesh jaisi jagahon par uski maujuudagi kii khabar milti rahi, lekin wo aaj tak haath nahin laga
 How was the murder of Chacko? According to the police, Kuroop, along with his brother and driver, committed the murder
 us samay wo abu dhabi ki ek marine petrol company main kaam kiya karata tha
 Investigating officers have told the reason for the murder, the money and the desire to live an extraordinary life
 jaanch se pataa laga ki chaako ko maarane se pehle khooni kurup jaisi dikhne vaali laash dhund rahe the
 When they did not find such a corpse, they started searching for a living human
 jo chaako par jaakar khatm hui
 They gave him a lift and then made him unconscious after drinking something
 jiske baad kurup ke bhai bhaskar pillai ne use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 This Puri incident was executed at Pillai's house
 unhone chaako ke kapade utaare or phir uskaa chaharaa jala diya
 So that he cannot be identified
 jiske baad sharir ko ghatana sthal par le jaaya gaya
 He was eventually set on fire by sitting on the driver's seat
 chaako ke parivaar kaa logon ne kiya apmaanahatya se thik ek saal pehle chaako kii shaadi hui thi
 His wife was a pregnant at that time
 usne apane pati ko insaaf dilaane ke liye kaaphi museebaton kaa saamana kiya
 He also had to lose his job
 lekin insaaf aaj tak nahin mila he
 Pillai was sentenced to life imprisonment
 lekin kurup itnaa bada jurm karke ab bhi faraar he
 She was last seen in 1990 at Santa Cruz Airport in Mumbai
 monsoon se pehle dilli kii sabhi sadakon par gaddon ko bhar janaa chahie tha lekin lagata he agenciyon ne pichhali barish se koi sabak nahin liya he kyonki dilli ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main sadakon kaa haal bura he or inaki sud lene vaala philhal to koi nahin dikhataa

 Large pits were seen on the road coming from Mukundpur towards Azadpur flyover
 sadak ke baayin taraf bane ye gadde barish ke dinon mengambhir khatrasabit ho sakate hai
 According to the people living here, this pit has been the same for the past several months because it was not filled after putting the power line and after the road cutting, the part of the road remained the same
 jahangirpuribarish ke dinon main jahangirpuri kii sadaken talab main tabdeel ho sakati hai
 The main road here which passes in front of block-k is in very poor condition these days
 sadak kaa bada hissaa in dinon kharaab he
 According to local people, road cutting was done here to lay the sewer line but after that the pits were not filled
 in gaddon ke kaaran is sadak par road kating ke kaaran dhul bhi udati he jisase aas paas rahane vaale log kaaphi pareshaan hai
 According to those who passed through here, they have survived many times by crashing to avoid potholes
 embi rodsouth dilli main mahrauli se shuru hokar badarpur tak jane vaali embi road par batra aspataal ke saamne kaa ek bada hissaa kshatigrast he
 Over the past several days, the overflowing water from the drain has spoiled part of the road from place to place and large pits have formed on this part
 is sadak par yatayaat kaa dabaav adhik hota he jisamen barivahanon kaa awagamanabhi bahut hota he
 According to those passing through it, apart from escaping the pits, they also have to avoid dirty water and mud, otherwise it is also common to get clothes dirty while going through this road
 yahaan rahane waalon ke mutabik kuch hi din pehle yahaan ek loding auto sadak par bane bade gadde ke kaaran palat gaya tha
 Now the question is whether the agencies who are responsible for the maintenance of these roads are waiting for a big accident
 aakhir kyon vakt par in sadakon kii marammat kaa kaam puraa nahin kiya ja rahaa he

 is sammelan ke jariye vah apane pehle charan ke andolan ko samaapt karegi
 In fact, the Congress is also worried that the Trinamool Congress has been seen as the most aggressive against the TMC government in recent times after the Trinamool Congress's sharp attack on the Modi government and Mamata Banerjee's direct challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii note bandi par sansad main lee hui lead congress ab khoti dikh rahi he

 Last year Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi was our Gala Night Speaker
 ab vah bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hai
 In the upcoming general election, his hand is being said to be heavy
 pichley chunaavon main congress party haaavee rahi he
 This time the election is divided between anti-modi and Modi supporters
 bijepi kaa sawaal kahin he hi nahin
 Modi has also come to dominate his party
 yahaan tak ki kshetreey partiyon kii bhoomika ko bhi 'modi samarthak' or 'modi virdohi' main vargeekrut karke dekha ja rahaa he
 After a long time, there is a clear choice before the election
 yah march 1977 ke jaisaa he, jab indira gandhi kendriya shakhsiyat thim or utani hi vivaadaaspad bhi
 This fact made the election interesting
 maujuuda bharat ke bare main mujhe lagata he ki yah ek bhookha dekh he
 Hungry means not hungry for food
 agar ham thik se vitaran kar paaen to yahaan itnaa bhojan he ki koi bhookha nahin soyega
 We are hungry for capital, growth, energy, education and opportunities

 mujhe yah kehete hue dukh hota he ki karpshan hamaari jindagi ke lagbhag har pahalu main pravesh kar chukaa he or hamaare pyaare khel cricket ko bhi chapet main le chukaa he
 This made corruption the biggest issue of the election
 main isse khush hum
 Because whoever comes to power, he will have to make serious efforts to deal with this 'cancer'
 kuch hi ghanton main sibiai ke diarector ranjit sinha yahaan maujuud honge, jinhone kai bade ghotaalon kii jaanch kii
 At a time when the Supreme Court has called the CBI a 'cage parrot', this task will surely be difficult

 The issue of Lokpal Bill also got a new dimension from the question of CBI independence

 How successful the 49 days of his power upheaval are is a matter of debate
 lekin maujuuda daur kii raajnneeti par unka gaharaa asar padaa he
 There has been a tremendous retrenchment of candidates and election funds within the parties
 lekin hamen yah bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki hero ke bina 'jeet' nahin pai jaati

 yahaan bie kii ek chaatra ne suicide se pehle uskaa sketch banaaya
 For the experience of hanging on her hanging, the student first comprehended three sketches one by one and then after that she hung from the fan
 sket ke madhyam se use pankhe se latakana zyada sahi laga or usne pankhe se latak kar suicide kar liya
 This student neither had any tension nor any illness nor any affair
 usne suicide note main bhi sirf itnaa likhaa kii main apni marji se suicide kar rahi hu
 Now from the family of the girl to the police, everyone is surprised to make a sketch of her
 chaatra ne banaae teen skechamohani ne jab suicide kiya to uske pehle usne isi tarah ke ek-ek kar teen sketch banaae the
 In one, he showed himself hanging from the lattice of the courtyard, in the second he would hang from the wall and in the third he would hang from the ceiling fan
 in tino sketch ko banaakar pehle usne anubhav kiya kaise latakana acha rahegaa
 After all, he felt interested to hang from the fan and then he hanged by hanging from the fan

 She passed First Division at Inter

 He did not even have a close friend
 iske pehle usne is tarah kaa kabhi koi sketch bhi nahin banaaya tha
 At that time, the householders were only regretting that if there was any deficiency then it would have taken such steps, why would it have been correct after all the facilities
 15 dinon main saamne aayaa doosraa maamlakanpur main pandrah din ke andar is tarah kii suicide karne kaa yah doosraa maamla he

 Kader Khan passes away Kader Khan wrote dialogues for around 250 Bollywood films, worked in 300 films
 lekin kadar unhen pehali badi shoharat film 'roti' se mili
 However, it was not easy to get Kader Khan to work in this film
 kadar khan ne ek intervyuu main is puure vaakye ko bataaya ki kaise hindi cinema ke diggaj manmohan desai ne unhen pehle baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya or phir sir ankhon par baitha liya
 Desai was then called the showman of Bollywood
 kadar khan ne intervyuu main bataaya tha, "mere produsar rahe chuke habib nadiadwala ne mujhe manmohan desai se milwaaya
 Manmohan ji was very upset at that time
 isaki vajah thi ki wo film roti bana rahe the, lekin jisase bhi wo iske dialogs likhva rahe the wo unhen jam nahin rahaa tha
 For this reason, Habib Nadiadwala introduced me to Manmohan Desai
 "film roti ne badal di kadar khan kii kismatmulakaat par manmohan desai ne kaha, are inhen (kadar khan) hataao yaar, bahut miyaan bhaaiyon ko tri kar liya he
 Manmohan Desai said to me, "look Mian, if i like the dialog, i can think of taking it
" nahin to main tumhaare saamne parchaa faad ke phenk duungaa
 "then i said," You told me what to do if you feel bad, but have not told what will happen if you feel good
 " tab manmohan ji ne kaha, "main acha lagane par tumhen sir par rakhkar naachoongaa
 "he liked the film and kept me on the spot
 kadar khan kii vajah se skool main pit jate the bachche, chhodana padaa ye kamkaise manmohan desai-prakaash mehara camp main kiya kaamkadar khan ne ek intervyuu main bataaya tha, "us daur main manmohan desai ke saath kaam karata tha
 At that time Prakash Mehra also made films
 unhen bhi meri jarurat thi
 But these two were opposition camps
 donon camp main ek saath kaam karnaa us vakt naammumkin tha
 The one who worked in one camp could not work in another
 lekin main akelaa tha jo donon ke saath kaam karata
 "" Because of me, Amitabh Bachchan also used to work
 mujhase poochhate the log ki aap donon camp main kaise kaam karte hai
 Whose camp are you in tab main bas yahi jawaab detaa tha ki donon (manmohan desai-prakaash mehara) meri camp main kaam karte hai
 i do not work in their camp
 "kehane kii jarurat nahin ki 70 or 80 ke dashak main manmohan desai or prakaash mehara ne hindi cinema main ek se badhkar ek blockbster filmein banaai
 These films gave Amitabh popularity and superlative status
 # kaderkhansaab was one of the finest actors of our country
