 He is worthy of applause and praise

 ' pratishthit saahitiyik patrika lamahi kaa nayaa ank (april-sitambar sanyuktank) har us pathak ke liye ek durlabh uphaar kii tarah he, jisaki dilchaspee kahaniyon main he
 Rare because the laborious effort of documenting the development and transformation of Hindi story 'lamahi' and its editor Vijay Rai is not a matter of everyone
 saathottar peedi se ab tak ke mahatvapurn kathakaron kii kahaniyon ke samyak moolyankan kii koshish main vah pichley 2 saalon se jute hue hai
 He is indeed deserving of congratulations for doing such a huge job in a meager resource
 hindi kahani kii nabz pakadaney kii is koshish kaa sateek naam patrika ne diya he- hamaara katha samay
 This is the first section
 kul 3 khandon kii yojana he
 The first section focuses on female narrators
 mamata kaaliya, suryabala, mridula garg, sudhaa aroda, nasira sharma, maitreyi puspa, namita singh, ushaa kiran khan, madhu kankaria, sushamaa munindra, geethashri, alka saraavagi, lavalin, manisha kulshreshth, jaya jadhvani, pratyaksha, aakanksha paare kashiv, pragna pandeya, pragna, soni pandeya samet kul 46 mahila kathakaron kii rachanaaon kii padtaal is ank main kiya gaya he
 Actually, this is a comprehensive and thorough investigation of female fiction writing from seventy-seven generations till now under the pretext of 46 women storytellers
 main yah maanata hum ki purush kathakaron kii tulana main mahila kathakaron ke saamne chunautiyaan zyaada kathin rahi hai or isliye vishay ki vividhta se lekar lekhan ke andaaz tak unke saamne sambhaavnaaen bhi utani hi vyapak rahi hai
 Female narrators did not miss this possibility
 yahi vajah he ki peedi dar peedi stri katha lekhan lagaataar bold or majboot hota gaya
 Whether it is in the family or in society, women have raised the voice of resistance to outspokenness in their stories
 pankaj parashar ne apane aalekh stri-katha or anubhavjanya aakhyaan main lavalin ke ek bayaan kaa hawala diya he
 Lavalin had said, "how many relationships does the woman play in the family, in society, in the field - mother-in-law, brother-in-law, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, etc
 because she has a heart
 vah harek ke saath vyaktitv kii purnataa ke saath judati he- vicitra taur par hin-kunthit or sankuchit hota he
 That is why a woman can perform many maitris
 " mahila kathakaron ke lekhan ko samajhane ke liye lavalin kaa yah bayaan mahatvapurn he
 The woman who plays all the relationships with perfection - that makes her so experienced and sensitive that her personality emerges with perfection in the story as well
 uske paas vishyon kii jo vividhta he, vah in rishton kii baarik pakad hone kii vajah se hi he
 The male narrator may have missed it here
 isliye mahilaon ke bare main jis pramanikta ke saath stri kathakaar likh sakati he, uski ummid kisi or se nahin kii ja sakati
 It is also noteworthy that the writing of migrant women storytellers has also been outlined in this issue
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki yah ank sangrahntiya he lekin dukh kii baat he ki itani acchhee patrika bhi ab sansaadhan ke abhaav main band hone ke kagaar par pahunch gai he
 Will we Hindi people keep on talking only for a long time or will we save magazines trying to reach good readers by buying a few magazines every month
 vijay raay ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he, "ham lagaataar baari ghate main chal rahe hai
 We are constantly struggling and striving to make the conditions better
 lekin yadi kaamyaab nahin hue to oktober-disambar 19 ank se lamahi kaa print varjan majabuuran band karke ham ise sirf online hi jari rakh paaenge
 “it is a really sad situation
 kisi patrika kaa digital sanskaran aana bahut acchhee baat he
 It is a big platform and the magazine reaches all over the world
 pathakon tak pahunchane ke liye har nai takanic kaa istemaal karnaa jaruri he lekin aarthik sankat ke kaaran patrika kaa print sanskaran band karnaa pad rahaa he to jaahir taur par yah dukhad he
 We the readers are to blame for this and if this happens then we should not forgive ourselves
 abhi bhi vakt he
 We should start buying and reading magazines, so that magazines like Lamhi do not become a part of history

 "learning the art of baudam vs bindasalarki"? Seems like an old time thing
 lekin rahul jaise baudamon ke liye khaas taur par badi baat he
 According to the traditional definition of Baudam, these are extremely boring hardworking people deprived of social skills (oxford Dictionary)
 lekin aaj nae edlt upanyaason kii badaulat baudam ab nayaa sexi he
 Their "IQ" is more than their weight
 ’’ or ve ‘‘avishwasaneey had tak aakarshak hote hai
 This definition is of the Urban Dictionary

 Fourteen-year-old Lolly has changed her face
 dilli kii is ladki ne kaha, ‘‘main bindaas group main hua karti thi
 '' what does this mean? "actually cool boys and girls break all the rules, so they are called heroes, while grades get the worst
" ’’ iskaa matlab-class chhodia, sharaab pinaa, cigarette pinaa, dating, raat kii partiyaan or sex
 Cool girls put their pictures on the internet in transparent clothes, put on a lot of makeup

 She is very popular because she helps her friends see interesting girls' profiles on Facebook
 uskaa kahana he, ‘‘ve in ladakiyon kaa shikaar kar sakate hai
 "as Lolly suggests, she changed because she does not want to study
" ‘‘to ab main baudam ho gai hum
 All my friends are zany

 "I just apply mascara and lip balm and it only takes two to 10 minutes to get ready
" ’’ baudam ke liye sex koi badi baat nahin he
 "girls talk of attraction and boys talk of small hearts
" ’’ usne mana ki ladke sex kii baat bahut zyada karte hai, ‘‘or ham main se koi bhi inke bare main lagaataar baat nahin karata
 In this battlefield named Classroom, be it cool or bold, both of them have only the ghost of love
 bindaas to hameshaa prem main duube rahete hai (vaise loli or uske doston ko shaq he ki ve is shabd kaa matlab bhi samajhate hai)
 "they change companions frequently, keep condoms in their pockets and use sex after school or college
" baudam ko prem ke vichaar se prerana milti he
 They read new adult novels with great interest to understand love, but keep away from sex
 yaa to isliye ki padhai main bahut duube rahete hai yaa phir uske liye taiyaar nahin hai yaa sahi saathi nahin mila he
 "I have told my mother that if i am deeply in love and i am serious and know what i am doing, then i should have sex before marriage
" ’’ unki mummy ko yah baat katai pasand nahin ai

 'aryabhata', the first satellite to be built in India, was launched on 19 April 1975

 Scientists used it to gain information in X-rays, astronomy, space science and solar physics
 11 farvari 1992 main isane dobaaraa prithvi ke vaataavaran main pravesh kiya

 When the Meteorological Department claimed a few months ago that a good monsoon is going to come to the country this year, the biggest relief came from the economy because a good monsoon was going to bring good days for it
 centre kii satta main baithi narendra modi sarkaar bhi khush thi kyonki isse use ummid bandhi ki achche monsoon ke baad 2019 ke shuruyaat main hone vaale aam chunaavon se pehle use behtareen aarthik aankade milenge jiske jariye vah majbootee ke saath apane prachaar abhiyaan ko chalaate hue satta main bane rahane ke apane prayaason ko safal kar legi
 On the hope of a good monsoon, the central government showed its resolve to double the income of the farmers and through it the formula of bringing good days to the farmers
 iske chalate kendra sarkaar ne kharif fasalon kii emspi main 50 fisadi kaa ijapha karne kaa faisla liya
 However, the formula announced by the central government is effectively showing only one-third increase in MSP
 gauratlab he ki swaminathan cameti ne kisaanon kii maang ko dhyaan main rakhte hue emspi main 50 fisadi ke ijaphe kii sifarish kii thi
 But the Central Government did this increase by adding the cost and hard work of the farmer family to the crop, due to which farmers will have to be satisfied with only 12% instead of 50% on their yield
 jaahir he yah phayda bhi tab milegaa jab kisaan sarkaar ke kharid kendra par apni fasal bech sakegaa
 Read this: Good monsoon this year, it will be rain of votes for BJP in 2019! However, even after this formula, farmers got some hope from the increase of Rs 200 (rs 1,550 to Rs 1,750 per quintal) on MSP of paddy because good Due to the monsoon, this increase was going to give them some extra income
 yah baat alag he ki yah ijapha april 2018 tak dhan kii bazaar main 1,850 rupee prati quintal kii keemat se behad kam he
 On the other hand, if the monsoon is strong, then obviously the market price of paddy will increase and on the other hand, the benefit of this Rs 200 increase in MSP to the farmers will be far away
 ab mausam main karavat kaa sanket dena shuru kar diya he
 The Meteorological Department's assessment is turning
 mausam vibhaag ne haal hi main mana ki uttar bharat or purvi bharat main june maheene ke dauraan barish anumaan se 5 fisadi tak kam rahi he
 The Meteorological Department is now saying that as of June, the monsoon is showing a difference of up to 9% in these areas of the country so far in July
 mausam vibhaag ko ashanka he ki june kii tarah july ke dauraan bhi desh ke in ilaakon main monsoon ke aankade maayoos karne vaale ho sakate hai
 Due to this, sowing of kharif crops has come down by 6 July
 kendra sarkaar ke apane aankadon ke mutabik is samay tak kharif buaai main kul 14
 There has been a decline of 2 percent
 vahiin kharif kii sabase pramukh fasal or kisaanon kii aamadani ke liye ridh maani jane vaale dhan kii buaai main abhitak 15 fisadi kii kami darj hui he
 13 in other cash crops like oilseeds and pulses sowing

 There has been a decrease of 4 percent
 kanoon ke kuch hi praavdhaan aise honge jinhen bhartiya nagarikon se vyapak rup se itani aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa he jitna ki dhara-66e ko
 Although its legal purpose was to prevent fraud on the Internet, it soon became clear that this provision of the law could be misused openly
 loksabhaa ne is sanshodhan vidheyak ko 23 disambar, 2012 ko mahaj saat minute main chah anya niyamanon ke saath bina kisi bahes ke paarit kar diya tha
 The next day, the Rajya Sabha also passed it
 sansad ko is par vistaar se bahes karne kaa mauka hi nahin mila
 In a democracy, it is always objectionable for the Bills to be passed in Parliament amidst any ruckus
 yah sahi he ki samvidhan nyaaypalika ko samiksha kaa adhikaar detaa he lekin sansad ko hameshaa is baat ko sunishchit karnaa chahie ki vah jo kanoon banaati he, ve uske adhikaar yaa kanoonee daayre ke baahar nahin hone chahie
 But Parliament failed to ensure this
 maine is galati ko sudhaarney kii do baar koshish kii—ek vaidhanik prastaav rakhkar or phir sadasyon kaa ek nijee prastaav rakhkar
 i moved the first cancellation motion in the history of Parliament to reject the Information Technology (intermediate Guidelines) Rules
 sansad main is par bahes hui or tab soochna praudyogiki mantri kapil sibbal ne tamaam hitdharakon se vichaar-vimarsh karne ke baad sadan ko badlaav karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 But the government could not maintain the assurance
 doosraa mauka sadasyon ke ek nijee prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan aayaa tha jisamen sarkaar se samvidhan ke anuchhed 19(2) ke anuroop 66e main sanshodhan karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha
 i remember Sibal's intervention in it: "the boundaries of the use of freedom of expression in social media cannot be constitutionally determined because at the time the constitution was structured, there was no social media at all, only print media
 " ab supreme court ne yah sahi hi spasht kar diya he ki bhale hi internet ko anya media se alag mana jaae or uske liye alag kanoon bane lekin un kanoonon ko bhi samvidhan ke anuchhed 19(2) ke pradutt abhivyakti kii aazaadee par 'vaazib paabandiyon' kii padtaal se to guzarana hi hoga
 When we expressed concerns over the ambiguity of the words used in the law, Sibal said, "please do not ask us to define words that cannot be defined
 jo aapako vichlit kar saktaa he, vah sambhav he mujhe vichlit na kare
 "the Supreme Court has disputed this plea in para 74 of its judgment," the issue referred to is clearly defined in section 294 — that is, it must be due to some obscene remark or act
 
 dhara-510 main yah takalif kisi vyakti ko aise kisi vyakti se hi honi chahie jo nashe main ho or jab vah yah takalif kisi saarvajanik sthaan yaa aisi kisi jagah par pahunchaae jahaan uskaa pahunchnaa anaadhikrut ho
 Such a fine and clear description of the crime in the Penal Code is suspiciously absent in Section 66A, which is overt, open and unambiguous language
 "nihit rajnatik swaarthon kii vajah se durupyog kii puri gunjaaish rakhane vaale kanoonee praavdhaan ko khaarij kar court ne spasht kar diya he ki koi bhi kharaab kanoon kisi nyaayik padtaal par khara nahin utrega or abhivyakti kii aazaadee ko sarvocch str kii sanvaidhanik suraksha hasil he
 Freedom of expression recognizes the right of a person to express dissent and protest
 haalanki nikat ateet main nyaaypalika ne virodh kii aazaadee par baari paabandiyaan lagane vaale kai faisle die hai, phir bhi is faisle ko virodh kii aazaadee ko abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa ekikrut hissaa maanane kii disha main mile kaa pathar mana ja saktaa he
 Regulation of Internet is necessary in the country but this does not mean that it should be completely controlled

 Veena Malik says that the photo printed on the cover page is not hers, but her photos have been tampered with, but no one is listening to them, so she has claimed a defamation of Rs 10 crore on the magazine

 com / exf9qvnkbf — Bhavya Mohan (@ucommbhavya) April 22, 2018 Let us know that Milind traditionally took seven rounds with his 25-year-old girlfriend Ankita Konwar
 milind 52 saal ke hai, ankitha kii umr 27 saal kii he
 There was a lot of negative news about this distance of age between the two, but after the marriage, their relationship has stopped speaking
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne karnataka main itihaas rachaa
 The party won 25 of the total 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 bijepi ko is dakshini rajya main loksabhaa chunaav main itani badi kamyaabi pehle kabhi nahin mili thi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won only 17 seats from Karnataka
 bataa den ki karnataka main jahaan tak loksabhaa chunaav kaa sawaal he, to 2009 tak yahaan congress kaa dabadabaa hi mana jaataa rahaa tha
 However, as the BJP has expanded its base here, the fort of BJP in this only state in the south is becoming stronger
 23 may ko loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane se chand din pehle india today – exis maai india ke survey ne anumaan vyakt kiya tha ki bijepi karnataka main 21 se 25 seat jeet sakati he
 The survey estimate was accurate in the results and BJP won 25 seats
 congress ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main rajya se 9 seat par jeet hasil kii thi, lekin is baar use ek hi seat se santosh karnaa padaa
 Data from Axis My India shows that BJP got 51% votes from Karnataka and 42% for congress-jds alliance in 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 anya ke khate main 7% vot gaye
 The Lingayat community has been considered the bjp's vote bank in Karnataka ever since the Congress publicly humiliated former Karnataka Chief Minister Virendra Patil
 1990 main rajeev gandhi ne bangalore airport se hi virendra patil kii karnataka siem ke pad se chuttee kar di thi
 The Lingayat community went through this exasperation and as a result, the Congress had to lose power from the state in the 1994 assembly elections
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main ligayat samudaay majbootee ke saath data rahaa
 69% of Lingayat community voters voted in favor of BJP
 vahiin congress gathbandhan ko lingayat samudaay se 23% votaron kaa hi bharosa mil sakaa
 The Congress hoped that its alliance with the JDS would be effective in the transfer of votes in Vokkalinga community-dominated areas
 congress-jedies gathbandhan ko vokkalinga samudaay ke 48% vot hi mili
 On the other hand 41% votes of Vokkalinga voters also went to BJP
 is tarah bijepi ne is chunaav main vokkalinga samudaay ke voton main bhi khaasi send lagaai
 Muslim voters overwhelmingly voted for the Congress alliance in Karnataka
 muslim votaron main 86% ne congress or iske sahyogi dalon par bharosa kiya
 However 10% of the voters from the Muslim community also voted for the BJP
 jahaan tak obisi, saamaanya or anya kaa sawaal he to 59% votaron ne bijepi par bharosa jataayaa
 If different income groups are looked at, then 50% of the voters with purchasing power below Rs 5000 per month voted for BJP
 is varg se 43% votaron ne congress gathbandhan ko vot diya yani bijepi se 7% kam
 As these purchasing power increased, so did the difference between the BJP and the Congress among the sections
 21000 rupye se adhik kii krayshakti, yahaan tak ki 30,000 rupye tak ke varg main bijepi kaa vot share 60% rahaa
 At the same time, Congress alliance got only 33% votes from this class
 agar shiksha ke str kii baat kii jaae to nirakshar varg ne congress or iske sahyogiyon par adhik bharosa kiya
 The Congress alliance was voted by 52% of the voters from this class, while the Congress alliance got 48% votes from the class educated till eighth
 shiksha kaa str jaise jaise virgon main badha vaise vaise bijepi ko vot share bhi badhata gaya
 52% of the class educated till 10th voted BJP
 profeshnal degree ke str tak pahunchate bijepi ke liye ye vot share badhkar 58% ho gaya
 Talking about the age group 53% of the voters in the 18-25 age group voted for the BJP
 26-35 ayuvarg main 52% or 36-50 varg main 50% votaron ne bijepi ko vot diya
 However, 49% of the voters aged 61 years and above voted for the Congress alliance
 exis maai india ne kaamkaaj ke hisaab se votaron kii pasand ke data par bhai gaur kiya
 BJP got 59% votes from the private sector jobs category
 vahiin sarkari karmchaariyon main bijepi ko 60% votaron kaa samarthan mila
 As far as the professional class like doctors, lawyers, engineers are concerned, the Congress alliance and BJP got almost equal vote share from their voters
 is varg se 49% votaron ne congress gathbandhan ko vot diya
 Only 1% less, ie 48% voted for BJP
 bahucharchit karj maafee yojana bhi karnataka main sattarum jedies-congress gathbandhan ke liye loksabhaa chunaav main koi kamaal nahin kar pai
 Even among the farmers, 51% of the voters voted for the BJP
 krishi mazdooron main 49% ne bijepi par bharosa jataayaa
 50% in the cobbler class and 46% among the unemployed voted in support of the Congress alliance
 jahaan tak chaatro kaa sawaal he to 59% ne bijepi ke paksh main vot diya
 On the other hand, the Congress alliance got 46% votes in the house
 gruhaniyon main 45% ne bijepi ko vot diya
 BJP got the support of majority of voters from both urban and rural areas of Karnataka
 bijepi ko shahari or gramin donon kshetron main 51-51% votaron ke vot mili
 On the other hand, the Congress alliance was able to get the support of 43% voters in urban areas and 42% in rural areas
 gramin kshetron se congress ko kisaanon ke haq main lagaataar muhim chalaane kii vajah se acha samarthan milane kii ummid thi jo puri nahin ho saki
 When it comes to vote share on the basis of gender, most of the voters, both male and female, voted for BJP
 purushon main 54% ne bijepi or 40% ne congress gathbandhan ko vot diya
 Among women, 48% supported BJP and 44% with Congress alliance

 aise daur main jab tivi screen par news channel se dinaraat aati ‘tu,tu—main,main' kii daraavnee awaajon se log ajiz aa chuke hon, saatvi kaksha main padhane vaali ek bacchee sunayana ke marfat kahi gai kahani nazeer banakar aati he
 Even if you believe in this story that Prannoy Roy, the head of NDTV, is doing it as an anchor, then its importance does not diminish! You just see how patiently speaking he is bringing all the questions of life, so even considering the danger of criticism, i am saying that this is the best TV report of recent times
 chunavi kaal main raajnneeti jab apane charam par ho or roj—ba—roj sanchaar madhyamon se aapke kaanon tak hajaaron suchanaaen pahunch rahi hon, to aise main tay kar paanaa hi mushkil ho rahaa he ki aakhir sach kya he
 It is also surprising that through Mahatma Gandhi, truth seems to be in the greatest danger in such a short time of Gandhi's departure in the largest laboratory to know and understand the truth in the world
 bada fark or buniyadi fark to yah ki jhooth maanviya vyavhaar ke hisse se aage nikalakar vyavasthit or sangathit hokar apana aakaar dinon—din bada kar rahaa ho, aise vakt main keval bacchon se ummid kii ja sakati he ki unka sach baaki jamaane se zyada khara hoga
 Surely you hear the truth in every answer from Sunayna
 mushkil baat yah he ki ham bacchon kii aawaaj to sunanaa hi nahin chaahate hai, kyonki hamane maan liya he ki is duniya ke niti—niyantaa to bade hi hai, bachche is duniya ke hitgrahi bhar hai, unki raay kaa, unki aawaaj kaa is duniya kaa banane main koi mahatv nahin he, isliye samaaj kaa har tabaka bacchon se baat karne se takreeban bachataa hi rahaa he
 But you go to the children, befriend them, give them a chance and listen to them, like Sunayana, he will make you aware of all the bumpy paths of life, which you will follow, you will reach from where you will find the way to understand the truth
 , Because their worlds are not just worlds set on selfishness
 unki chintaa main gaanv ke jaanwaron se lekar har baarik masalaa he
 She knows that the city vegetable has more spices and she has to work with turmeric and chilli, yet she is encouraging to cook
 unhen sharaab kii samasya bhi pataa he or yah bhi pataa he ki ujjwala kaa silendar kyon nahin ban paa rahaa he? vah bade logon ke bacchon kaa ghamand bhi mahasoos kar paa rahi he or yah bhi ummid kar rahi he ki uske ritred bade guruji ab bhi uske skool main aaen
 Sunayna's understanding on farming and home economy is less than that of an adult
 in paristhitiyon ke bich bhi vah doctor banane kaa khwab paale he, vah bhi khud ke karier se zyada isliye ki gaanv main log biimaar hai, isliye doctor banakar aspataal bhi gaanv main hi kholana he, khoj lijie ki doctorl padhane ke baad doctor gaanv kii taraf ke aspataal kii ore apana munh bhi nahin karte
 So when Sunayna talks, the way of her development, the village of her dreams, the way of India of her dreams is seen as it should be, but our society does not seem to be paying attention to any such voice
 
 pichley saal jab madhyapradesh ke takreeban das jilon main hamane bahut vyavasthit tareeke se dhai hajaar bacchon kii awaajen lene kaa ek prayog kiya tha to usamen bhi takreeban har vishay par unki gambhir soch saamne ai thi
 After that, there was talk of making a declaration on behalf of the children for the assembly elections, even then the children talked deeply about farming and farming, not only keeping them limited to their issues
 bacchon kii baaten hairaan karne vaali lagati hai ki kaise vah bal sagaai kii traasadee ko bhi samajhate hai jabaki hamaara puraa vimarsh keval bal vivaah tak hi simit he, or desh ne niyam—kanoon bhi keval usee ko manyata dete hue banaae hai
 This report by Pranay shows a way for children to be heard and put in front of them in the best way

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday sought votes for Aam Aadmi Party candidate Ramchandra at the village Mahapanchayat held at Tehsil Ground in Bawana
 23 agast ko hone ja rahe bavana upachunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mahapanchayat kaa manch taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 However, instead of knowing the problems of the farmers of Bawana village, the Mahapanchayat became a political event, where even Arvind Kejriwal left no chance of counting the functioning of the government
 gaanv mahapanchayat ke manch par kisaan se zyada aam aadmi party ke vidhayak or mantri nazar aae
 Apart from Gopal Rai, Kailash Gehlot, Rajendra Gautam, around 15 mlas were present on the dais with Arvind Kejriwal
 vivaadon main rahe 'aap' se nilambit vidhayak amanatullah khan ne bhi manch par aakar party ummidavaar kaa samarthan kiya
 While the leaders of Bawana village put a long list of problems in front of the Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal also assured to fulfill every promise
 kejariwal ne sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginate hue kaha ki jawan or kisaan donon gaanv se aate hai or dilli main AAP sarkaar ne donon ke liye kaaphi kaam kiya he
 If the jawan of Delhi was martyred, he made a compensation of one crore rupees for his family
 pichley saal fasal kharaab hone par20 hajaar rupye prati acre muaavjaadia gaya
 But no other state or central government learned from Delhi
 kejariwal ne kaha ki gaanv kii raajnneeti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kejariwal ne dilli-dehaat ke purv siem choudhary brahm prakaash or sahib singh verma ko bhi yaad kiya
 Arvind Kejriwal told the farmers that the AAP government had made a rule to pay compensation of Rs 3 crore per acre for acquiring village land
 sirspur samet kai gaanv ke kisaanon ko check bhi baant die gaye the lekin hai court ke nirdesh se sarkaar ke kai faisle radd ho gaye
 Now the Delhi government is fighting in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki agar dillipurn rajya hoti to 15 dinon main kaam hota, abhi 15 maheene lag jate hai
 The government is going to bring 2 thousand buses to Delhi, most of these buses will be installed in the countryside
 siem kejariwal ne kaha ki har gaanv main mohalla clinics banaae jaaenge
 Villages passing through the Hightation wire will be grounded
 siem ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki AAP kaa pratyaashee jeeta, tabhi yahaan vikaas kaary ho sakenge
 bjp-congress mlas cannot develop the area
 gaanv mahapanchayat main pradesh sanyojak gopal raay ne kaha ki bijepi ke pratyaashee veda prakaash ne janata ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 In 2 years, the Government of Delhi gave funds for development work of 207 crores, till now nothing has been done
 mantri kailash gahalot ne kaha ki vah bhi dehaat se aate hai or mantri ke taur par dehaat kii samasyaon ko khatm karne par kaam kar rahe hai
 The ministers appealed to the farmers and said that Arvind Kejriwal gave recognition to the villages, respect them
 vahiin, ummidavaar ramchandra ne kaha ki vah vidhayak nahin, sevak bananaa chaahate hai

 htm seemaa par tanaav or kashmir main bigade halaat ke bich hurriyat conference ke udaaravaadi dhade ne buudhvaar ko kendra sarkaar par dabaav banaaya ki vah kashmir mudde kaa sthai hal nikaalane ke liye sarthak vaarta shuru kare
 a joint organization of various separatist groups headed by Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq held a meeting here to decide the current situation and strategy
 baithak main kaha gaya ki vakt aa gaya he jab bharat sarkaar or uske gathbandhan sahyogiyon ko kashmir ke visphotak halaat ko dhyaan main rakhana hoga or logon ke adhikarpurn sangharsh ko dabaane ke liye takat kaa prayog karne kii jagah vaarta ke jariye samaadhan khojane kaa tarika khojna hoga
 The statement issued after the Hurriyat meeting said that the negative and obstinate attitude of the Indian government has the potential to push the region towards destructive war, as the atmosphere in Kashmir has reached a very fragile condition and its solution can no longer be avoided
 algaavvaadiyon ke is sanghathan ne kaha ki kashmir kii janata kii ichchhaaon or aakankshaon ke aadhaar par kashmir mudde ko suljhaana mahatvapurn he taaki puure up-mahadweep ke logon kaa bhavishya surakshit kiya ja sake
 The statement said that negotiating only to negotiate cannot be helpful in resolving the Kashmir issue
 is mudde ko sirf teenon pakshon, bharat, pakistan or kashmiriyon ke bich ekasarthak vaarta kii prakriyaamein shaamil karke hi suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Also, political and economic stability in South Asian region is an issue related to Kashmir's solution

 But many such plans have been announced from both sides, which can prove to be a game changer
 haalanki congress or bijepi donon ke ghoshnaptr main anuchhed 370 or armd force special power act yani afaspa ko lekar bahes shuru ho gai he
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, who is in the news about his statements, says that the Indian Air Force's action against the terrorists in Balakot in Pakistan should not be linked to the general election nor should anyone take political advantage or credit for it
 saakshaatkaar main sadak parivahan va rajmarg, jal sansaadhan, nadi vikaas or ganga sangrakshan mantri ne kaha ki ve na to kisi pad ke daavedaar hai or na hi pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shaamil hai
 He said that Narendra Modi will return as Prime Minister with a huge mandate and this time he will get a larger mandate than the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 gadakari ne kaha, "pakistan ke khilaaf hawaii karrwai ko chunaav se nahin joda janaa chahie
 It should not be made an electoral issue nor should anyone take credit for it
 unhone kaha ki agar vipakshi dalon ko is par koi andeh he to ye unki dikkat he
 The minister said, "but i will request him that he should not do politics on this
" "pehle bhi gadakari ke bayanon ke kai myne nikaale jate rahe hai
 Like he has said that he is not only a dreamer but a leader who fulfills them
 unke kuch bayanon ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke virdohi apane liye phydemand maanate rahe hai
 When asked why the ruling party is raising this issue in the campaign, he said, "security is paramount for us
 is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran nahin kiya janaa chahie
 In India, if anyone doubts the martyrdom of our soldiers, if anyone speaks in the language of Pakistan, it all goes against the interests of the country
 ye rashtriya suraksha ke mudde hai or sabhi ko ek sur main bolnaa chahie
 Politics should not be held on such issues
 "aisi atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki chunaav ke baad sarkaar banane ke liye anya raajnneetik dalon ke samarthan kii jarurat padane par unhen agle pradhanmantri ke rup main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 On this, he said that he is not in the race for the post of Prime Minister even after getting a fractured mandate
 " unhone kaha, "na to meri aisi koi manshaa he or na hi aresas kii aisi koi yojana he
 nothing of the sort
 mere bayaan ko media dwaara tod-marod kar pesh kiya gaya
 You can go to youtube and hear my statement
 maine aisa kabhi nahin kaha
 "the minister said," i am neither a contender for any post nor am i involved in any race
 gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki main aashwast hum ki hamen 2014 ke mukaable vishaal janadesh milegaa or modi ji phir se pradhanmantri banenge

 Before the assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, the Congress has tried to surround the Modi government on the issue of GST and demonetisation
 congress mukhyalay main hui is baithak main notebandi or jiesti par sarkaar ko gherne ke liye congress kii ranneeti par varisht netaaon ke saath charchaa hui
 Several big Congress leaders, including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Motilal Vora, attended this meeting held at the Congress headquarters, where the strategy of encircling the Modi government was discussed on the occasion of completion of one year of demonetisation
 is baithak ke baad rahul gandhi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, '8 november desh ke liye behad bura din tha
 i do not know how the government can celebrate demonetisation
 notebandi ek traasadee jaisi thi
 i think PM Modi has not yet realized the sufferings of the common people
 maano desh ko hui takalif kaa piem modi ko pataa hi nahin
 At the same time, the Congress vice-president said on GST, he implemented a good idea very poorly
 isse puure desh ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Our Finance Minister of Punjab gave a detailed presentation on GST and explained how poorly implemented a good idea is
 unhone kaha,notebandi ke torpdoke baad jiesti doosraa torpeado tha, jisane bharat kii arthvyavastha ko dhwast kar diya
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala while addressing the reporters after this meeting said, 'we want to ask Modi ji where is the black money today? How many fake notes were caught and why are they not stopping? Who is responsible for the death of 150 people due to demonetisation? ”surjewala said,“ Who is responsible for this surgical strike on the earnings of small businessmen and daily laborers? Modi ji had said that if the countrymen have any problem after 50 days, then he is ready for every punishment
 ab desh moji kii sajaa tay karegaa

 Actress Shilpa Shetty turned 38 on Saturday
 unke janmdin par pati raaj kundra ne unase maafee maangi, jinase pichley dinon indian premier lig (ipel) main sattebaaji ko lekar poochtacha kii gai thi
 The comments kundra ne microbloging site twitor par likhaa he, "janmdin mubarak ho meri khubasurat patni shilpa
 i apologize to you for all the absurd situations you had to face in the past
 lekin sachai kuch hi dinon main saamne aa jaaegi
 " kundra ne shilpa ko janmdin par badhai dene vaale amitabh bachchan ko bhi dhanyavad diya
 He wrote, "thank you sir
 shilpa ke janmdin par aapkaa sandesh use kisi bhi duusare sandesh kii tulana main sabase adhik khushi degaa
 It has always been of special importance to him
 " Kundra wrote on microblogging site Twitter, "happy birthday my beautiful wife Shilpa
 main tumse un sabhi betuki sthitiyon ke liye maafee maangata hum, jiskaa saamana tumhen pichley dinon karnaa padaa
 But the truth will be revealed in a few days
 " Kundra also thanked Amitabh Bachchan who congratulated Shilpa on her birthday
 unhone likhaa, "dhanyavad sar
 Your message on Shilpa's birthday will make her happier than any other message
 uske liye hameshaa iskaa khaas mahatv rahaa he
 " kundra ne shilpa ko janmdin par badhai dene vaale amitabh bachchan ko bhi dhanyavad diya
 He wrote, "thank you sir
 shilpa ke janmdin par aapkaa sandesh use kisi bhi duusare sandesh kii tulana main sabase adhik khushi degaa
 It has always been of special importance to him
 " Off India, for some people it may be a time to celebrate, not to go to work, travel and spend time with their family all day long
 lekin yah jashn or aaraam unhen nuksaan pahunchane vaala ho saktaa he
 Because a day's closure in the country brings a huge economic loss for the economy
 is nuksaan kii bharpai kahin na kahin us ek din ke jashn kii keemat chukaa kar di jaati he
 What could be the loss of a day's shutdown to the economy? The question is as simple as the assessment
 pratidin factriyon main hone vaala utpaadan, share bazaar main sheyaron kii kharidari or bikwaali, real estate sector main pratidin rakhi ja rahi ek-ek eent, mal se lekar chote kiraanaa store kii bikri, sarkari se lekar nijee kshetra ke daftaron main kaamkaaj samet tourism, banking aurtransportesan(rail, hawaii safar, sadak ityadi) aise anek kshetra hai jo band yaa hadtaal se sidhe taur prabhavit hote hai
 Estimating and aggregating the day-to-day functioning in all such sectors shows the total loss to the economy
 lekin yah akalan karnaa utana aasaan nahin he lihaaja is ise samajhane ke liye arthvyavastha ke kuch pahaluon par gaur karne kii jarurat he jisase ek din ke band se nuksaan kaa andaja lagaaya ja sake
 Significantly, in September 2015, the country's trade unions called for a one-day shutdown
 is ek din ke band main desh kii banking vyavastha samet transportshan or anya sevaayen buree tarah prabhavit hui thi
 After this one-day shutdown, the Chamber of Indian Industries (CII) assessed that the country's economy had suffered a total loss of Rs 25,000 crore
 ek baar phir sitambar 2016 main central trade union ne ek din kebharat bandka aahvaan kiya
 Transport, manufacturing and banking services across the country were severely affected during this one day and the Industry Chamber Assocham claimed a loss of Rs 18,000 crore to the economy due to this one day shutdown
 ise padhein: desh ke is hisse main miltaa he sabase sasta petrol or dijalavahin janvari 2018 main dalit sanghathanon ne ek din ke maharashtra band kaa aahvaan kiya or band ke dauraan jahaan rajya main kaarobaar samet transportesan puri tarah thap pad gaya tha vahiin band main hinsa ke chalate rajya kii sampatti ko bada nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 After this shutdown, the retail business in the state claimed a loss of Rs 700 crore, while the hotels and restaurants in the state claimed a loss of over Rs 100 crore
 haal hi main july 2018 ke dauraan desh main 8 dinon tak trek chaalkon kii hadtaal rahi
 The loss to the economy during these eight days was estimated at about Rs 50 thousand crore
 is hadtaal ke chalate 20 july se lekar 28 july tak deshbhar main lagbhag 90 lakh trek sadakon par khadey ho gaye or iskaa sidhaa asar sarkari or nijee kshetra ke kaamkaaj ke saath-saath desh main khaane-pine kii vastuon se lekar factriyon ke utpaada par padaa
 Therefore, due to the strike of the truck, the economy suffered a loss of 6 to 7 thousand crore rupees per day
 ise padhein: khatm hui crude oil keemton kii aitihaasik raahat, ab dastak degi mahangaai!ab sawaal raajnneetik dalon dwaara kiye gaye ek din ke bharat band ke aahvaan kaa
 To assess the damage to the economy from this shutdown, it is necessary to look at these aspects: Loss of revenue to the central government: For the current fiscal, the central government has targeted a total revenue of Rs 12 lakh crore under the Goods and Services Tax
 
 yani prati maheene kendra sarkaar ko jiesti se 1 lakh karod rupee kii aamadani karne kii ummid he
 At the same time, during the last financial year, the central government earned revenue of about 90 thousand crore rupees from GST per month
 maujuuda vitt varsh main yadi kendra sarkaar ek din kaa jiesti rajasav na praapt kare to use lagbhag 3,333 karod rupee kaa nuksaan apane rajasav main uthaanaa padegaa
 It is worth noting that the revenue of GST is a symbol of all the economic activities (production and services) of the organized sector in the country and this loss of revenue directly reaches the central government's earnings as well as the country's economy
 vahiin desh main jiesti kii dar (5%,12%,18%,28%) par sarkaar ko 3,333 karod rupye kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Therefore, the loss of organized sector traders in stalling a day's business in the country is estimated to be several times the revenue of the government
 bharat band se samay-samay par arthvyavastha ko pahunche is nuksaan ke baad ab raajnneetik dalon dwaara aahvaan kiye gaye ek din kaa band arthvyavastha ko kitna nuksaan pahunchane ja rahaa he iskaa anumaan isapar lagegaa ki yah band kitna prabhavi rahaa
 BJP had fielded two Muslim candidates in Mewat and Ferozepur in Jhirka seat
 The BJP was ready to form the government despite not getting majority in Harriyana assembly elections
 bijepi ko kul 90 siton main se 40 par jeet mili he or vah bahumat se 6 seat dur rah gai he
 The party has also lost two seats in the Mewat region from where the Muslim candidates were fielded
 yani mevaat main bijepi kaa muslim card nahin chal paaya he
 The BJP had fielded Muslim candidates from the two assembly seats Nuh and Ferozepur Jhirka in Mewat region
 nunh se bijepi ne jakir hossain or ferozepur jhirka se naseem ahamed ko tikat diya tha
 Both these leaders have a good hold in the area, which was made a big bet by the BJP by making candidates from Muslim-dominated areas, but it failed completely
 haryana main sadh gaya khatter kaa number game! 5 nirdaleeyon kaa BJP ko samarthan kaa elaanbijepi in donon hi siton par chunaav haar gai he
 Congress candidate Aftab Ahmed from Nuh has won
 aftab ahamed ko 52245 vot mili hai, jabaki duusare number par rahe bijepi ke jakir hossain ko 48196 vot hasil hue
 Let me tell you that Zakir Hussain came from this seat in 2014 on a Congress ticket, but before the current elections he joined BJP and contested and lost his ticket
 ferozepur jhirka seat bhi bijepi nahin jeet pai
 Naseem Ahmed, who contested on a BJP ticket from Ferozepur, has got a total of 47521 votes, while Congress' victory candidate Mamman Khan had 84494 votes in favor
 yani nunh main jahaan bijepi pratyaashee jakir hossain ne bahut kareebi ladaai ladi, vahiin ferozepur jhirka main congress pratyaashee ke saamne bijepi ke naseem ahamed puri tarah fail ho gaye
 Let me tell you that Nasim Ahmed also came to the BJP from Congress recently, like Zakir Hussain
 isse pehle 2014 main naseem ferozepur seat se hi inelo ke tikat par jite the
 That is, the leaders who have been waving their seats in these seats of Mewat on the ticket of Congress and INLD, their impact faded as soon as BJP came to the court and bjp's maneuver failed in Mewat having 70 Muslim population

 dhumrapaan karne vaali mahilaayein yadi is aadat se 30 varsh kii umr se pehle mukti paa leti hai, to unhen swasthya sadhi khataron se bhi 97 pratishat mukti mil sakati he
 This is revealed by a study in Britain
 oxford university ke shodhakartaaon dwaara kiye gaye is adhyayan se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki agar 40 varsh kii umr se pehle bhi mahilaayein is aadat se tauba kar leti hai, to unke 90 pratishat swasthya sambandhit khatre ghat sakate hai
 In this research, 13 lakh women were studied
 samachar patr 'da independent' ne shanivaar ko apni report main kaha he ki jo mahilaayein madhya aayu main bhi dhumrapaan nahin chhodtin unki umr kam se kam 10 varsh kam ho sakati he
 The study showed that people who continue smoking even after the age of 40 have a 10-fold increased health risk compared to those who quit smoking at this age
 desh ke duusare sabase bade or 11 lakh karod rupye se zyada kii kul jamaa sampatti vaale bank isiisiaai kii board ne aakhirkaar bazaar niamak sebi or niveshkon ke dabaav ke aage ghutane tekte hue emdi or siio chanda kochar ko chuttee par bhej diya
 The move against Chanda Kochhar has been taken due to internal investigation into lending and payment of alleged benefits for himself and his personal conflict with the bank
 18 june ko board ne sandip bakshi ko paanch saal ke liye bank kaa chif oparating officer niyukt kiya, jo bank kii beemaa company isiisiaai prudential kii aguai kar rahe the
 Although there has been a demand for Kochhar's removal from the post for more than three months, in March the board gave a clean chit, dismissing the charges against him
 mushkil tab shuru hui jab media ne videocone or isiisiaai bank donon ke shairdharak arvind gupta ke uthaae muddon ko saamne rakhaa
 Gupta wrote to the Prime Minister and Sebi in 2016 and alleged that it was a clear case of "favor in favor of favor" in the bank
 unhone aarope lagaaya tha ki chanda kochar ke pati deepak kochar ne apane patni ke saath apane rishton kaa phayda uthaaya tha
 Deepak had brought Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot as an investor in his startup Nupower, an alternative energy company
 kendriya jaanch agency (sibiai) dhoot kii taraf se die gaye 64 karod rupye ke karj sahit nupower main hue lenden, alag-alag companiyaan banane or videocone ko isiisiaai bank se 3,250 karod rupye kaa karj milane ke chah maheene baad tamaam share dhoot kii taraf se deepak kochar ko antim taur par transfar kar dene kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Along with this, business deals of Deepak's brother Rajiv Kochhar are also under investigation
 rajeev kii company avista adwijuri group isiisiaai bank ke graahakon ko salaah detii thi, jise saaf-saaf hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla mana ja rahaa he
 In May, Sebi gave a show cause notice to ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar for alleged breach of the disclosure conditions under the Securities Act
 kochar ko patan kii taraf le jane vaale halaat bhi utane hi naatakeey rahe hai jitna korporate jagat main unka sidhiruaan chadhvaa tha
 Kochhar, 56, was associated with ICICI Bank as a management trainee in 1984 when it used to be the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
 tarakkee kii sidhiruaan chadhate hue unhone 2009 main bank ke emdi or siio kii kaman sanbhali
 He is also one of the highest payers in the industry — he earned Rs 6 crore in 2016-17
 se zyada tankhwaah milti thi
 His guide and then chairman of the bank
 ve
 Kamath entrusted him with the responsibility in the difficult times of 2003, when rumors of bank bankruptcy spread which were said to have started from Gujarat
 us vakt ve bank main retail kii pramukh thim
 Years later, Kochhar's ability to deal with the crisis when he took over as MD was tried again when the bank once again faced similar rumors after the global financial crisis
 unhen bank ko sector kii vishalkay company banane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jiske paas desh bhar main 4,800 se zyada shakhaon or 14,000 se zyada atm kaa vishaal network he or jiskaa kaamkaaj 17 deshon main failaa he
 In the year ended March 31, 2018, the bank earned a profit of Rs 6,777 crore after paying taxes
 jaankaron ko lagata he ki niveshkon kii chintaaon ko dur karne ke liye pehle hi kaaphi kuch kiya janaa chahie tha
 "investors are concerned that ICICI Bank's board did not take adequate and early action," says Sriram Subramaniam, founder and MD of ingovern, a shareholders proxy company
 yahaan tak ki puure board ko badalane kii jabardast maang bhi uth sakati thi
 The investigation should now be completed rapidly
 '' sutron kaa kahana he ki kochar kaa kaarykaal march 2019 main khatm ho rahaa he or sambhav he ki unke saath nayaa qaraar nahin kiya jayega or nae emdi or siio, sambhawatah bakshi, kaman sanbhaalenge
 Subramaniam says Bakshi, an old veteran of ICICI Bank (he joined the bank in 1986) would be a good choice due to his experience and knowledge at the bank
 phir tajjub kya ki 18 june ko jab pehali khabaren ain ki board ne kochar ko chuttee par jane or kaman bakshi ko saunpane ke liye kaha he, tab bisai main bank ke share chaar fisadi chadh gaye
 The Congress leader said that but this time in Gujarat he was defeated by his own Chanakya of the Congress party, who understood the tactics of Amit Shah, and used his deep understanding of the politics of Gujarat to stay one step ahead of Shah

 lalu kii is raajnneeti ne janata parivaar main aisi foot paidaa kii ki jorge or nitish jaise khud ko secular bataane vaale netaa bijepi ke saath morcha banaakar lalu ko haraane kii muhim ke sipaahi bane or antat isamen kaamyaab bhi rahe
 In 2005, Nitish became the Chief Minister of Bihar and the BJP-JDU duo claimed to end the Jungle Raj and bring good governance in Bihar
 magar jo log bihar kii raajnneeti ko lalu or nitish kii adlabadali ke taur par dekhakar santusht hai, ve ye samajhane main naakaam hai ki bihar main vaaki itihaas kaa chakkaa chal chukaa he, ab vahaan raajnneeti ko peeche lautaaya nahin ja saktaa
 If Lalu Yadav had not become the Chief Minister, Nitish's turn would never have come, and if Nitish had not, Jitan Ram Manjhi's path would never have been made
 darasal, jo log bihar main nitish or lalu yadav ke bich hue nae gathbandhan ko majaburi bataa rahe hai, ve yah samajhane main naakaam hai ki yah fori raajnneeti kii majaburi se zyaada itihaas ke saath chalane kii majaburi he, jisase lalu or nitish donon bekabar hai
 So politics is doing its work, democracy is doing its work and history is also doing its work
 nitish aaen yaa lalu jaaen yaa phir bijepi-congress aaen-jaaen, ab unke saamne ek badla hua bihar he, jisamen pichhadon kii upeksha sambhav nahin he
 Of course, there will be a time when these forces will understand and create their own agenda of development and will also fulfill the social justice demands
 agar nahin karengi to loktantr phir unka ilaaj kar degaa

 The people of Madhya Pradesh are requested not to spoil mutual relations by taking exit polls
 kyonki eggzet polon ke bich hi chunaav ho gaya he
 People have forgotten that the election was held between the Congress and the BJP
 madhya pradesh kii janata chaahe to 11 disambar tak goa chali jaae taaki zyaada dimag karaab na ho
 One thing is certain
 chaahe sahi ho yaa galat ho, eggzet pole vaale ko ek nayaa paise kaa aarthik nuksaan nahin hota he
 In every election, some exit poll companies disappear and some new ones come up
 acha ek or baat

 According to the exit poll of Republic TV and c voters, BJP will get 90 to 106 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 yani sarkaar nahin banegi
 10 seats are coming down from 116
 congress ko 110 se 126 siten aa rahi hai
 Congress government will be formed
 yani pichhali baar ke 58 ke mukaable 126 siten congress ko aa rahi hai
 The exit poll of Republic TV and Jan Ki Baat is giving different results
 is eggzet pole ke anusaar bijepi ko 108 se 128 siten aa sakati hai or congress ko 95 se 115 siten aa sakati hai
 So an exit poll of Republic TV is going on to form the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh, the second one is the Congress government
 mere to paseene chhot rahe hai

 Sanger's political journey may be 20 years old, but in these two decades he has lived in four parties
 senger ko viraasat main apane naanaa se jameen jaaydaad hi nahin, siyasat bhi mili he
 He is close to UP Bahubali Independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya
 yahi vajah he ki soobe main har din teen encounter karne vaali yogi kii upi police ke haath vidhayak ke girebaan tak nahin pahunch paa rahe
 The village of Makhi, located about 15 km from the town of Unnao, which was found by Nana, has been turned into a police camp
 kuldeep singh senger mularoop se fatehpur ke rahane vaale hai, lekin unki parvarish nanihaal unnav ke isi makhi gaanv main hui
 Sanger has a jewelry business in Unnao and Kanpur
 raja shankar sahay inter college se wo 12veen tak padhe hai
 After independence, the headship of the village remained with the Sanger family
 Since independence, the headship of Makhi village has been with the Sanger family
 mahaj do baar gaanv kii pradhani unke haathon se gai he
 After independence, his maternal grandfather Babu Singh became the head of the village and lived for 36 years
 naanaa kii ungali pakadakar bade hue kuldeep singh senger ne unki siyaasi viraasat ko sambhala
 Sanger first became the head of the village in 1987 and spent seven and a half years
 gaanv kii siyasat maa ke hathvidhayak banane se pehle senger ne apni maa chunni devi ko 2000 main gaanv kaa pradhan banavaa diya

 basapa ummidavaar ke taur par 2002 main unnav sadar vidhansabha kshetra se chunaav main utre or jeet hasil karke vidhayak bane
 In the love of Raja Bhaiya, the bsp's sympathizer left the screws on Raja Bhaiya while Chief Minister, so Sengar did not like this thing
 mayawati ke satta main rahete hue wo baghawat nahin kar sake
 But after withdrawing the bjp's support, at the behest of Raja Bhaiya, he left the party with rebel mlas of the BSP and supported the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government
 kuldeep singh senger 2007 main sapa se bangaramau vidhansabha seat se chunaav lade or dobaaraa vidhayak bane

 The Government of Madhya Pradesh has rectified the mistake made in Guna a few days ago
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki shivaraj sarkaar ne aisi kya galati kar di thi jisko sudhaar liya gaya he? to aapako bataa den ki ham us galati kii baat kar rahe hai jiske kaaran kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ko loksabhaa main jyotiraditya sindhiya se maafee maangani padi thi
 Let me tell you that the case of not calling the local MP Jyotiraditya Scindia in the program of NHAI held in Guna was caught a lot in the past
 is maamle main soobe kii raajnneeti itani garma gayi thi ki sindhiya ne loksabhaa main visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice diya tha, jiske baad kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne kaarykram main naa bulaaye jane par sindhiya se maafee maangi thi
 The government has corrected the mistake made in Pichor by far-fault
 shivpuri jile ke pichor main somvaar ko yojit hone vaale sarkari kaarykram ke aamantran patr main congress ke loksabhaa saansadajyotiraditya sindhiyaaka bhi naam likhaa gaya he
 In fact, in the presence of CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Pichore, the foundation stone of the irrigation project is inaugurated
 kaarykram main jila prashasan ne jyotiraditya sindhiya ko bhi bulaayaa he
 The event will be held at Chhatrasal Stadium in Pichore
 sarkari aamantran patr main jyotiraditya sindhiya ke alaava unki buaa or madhyapradesh sarkaar main khel mantri yashodhara raaje sindhiya, jal sansaadhan mantri narottam mishra, swasthya mantri rustam singh kaa naam bhi chhapavaya gaya he
 Shivraj Sarkar was severely criticized for not calling Scindia in the Guna program, while the local MLA was also thrown off the stage in front of Shivraj Singh Chauhan, after which the matter reached the Lok Sabha
 lekin pichor main lagata he sarkaar ne pichhali galati se sabak le liya he
 Master blasterschin Tendulkar in his book 'playing It My Way' has written several criticisms of then-cricket coach Greg Chappell and made it public before the book was released
 ab iske baad bhartiya cricket jagat main ek tufaan sa uth khadaa hua he or us samay ke kai cricketer chapel ke bare main alag-alag tarah kii baaten kah rahe hai
 Whether it is VVS Laxman or Harbhajan or anyone else, everyone has come down on the criticism of the chapel and started declaring them villain
 sachin tendulkar kii baton main sachai ho sakati he or chapel par lagaae unke aarope sahi bhi ho sakate hai lekin ek saath itane saare khilaadiyon kaa uth khadaa hona hairaan kar detaa he
 Why are these players opening the locks on their tongues after so many years? Why did they keep quiet for so long? Were they waiting for the right time? Altogether many questions are arising which will have to find answers
 jis vakt kii ye baat he tab in sabhi khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan kaisaa chal rahaa tha? is baat kii bhi vivechna kii jaani chahie kyonki jo khilaadi aaj bol rahe hai ve shaayad us samay apni pojishan bachaane ke liye chup the yaa phir ise bhul janaa chaahate the
 But a retired coach could be criticized at any time
 usamen aisa kya tha ki ye khilaadi chup rahe?kya 2007 world cap kii sharmnaak haar ke liye sirf coach hi jimmedaar he? kya aisa nahin ho saktaa ki chapel deele-dhaale khilaadiyon ko fitness kii kasuti par khara utarataa na paakar unhen kas rahe hon? unhone australian andaaj main bharat ke sukumaar khilaadiyon kii koching kerani chaahi or saare khilaadi apane bhavishya ke liye ashankit ho gaye
 It may also be that like a good coach, he has been trying to change the nature of the team
 bhartiya cricket ke senior khilaadi hameshaa se apane ko superior samajhate rahe hai or kisi tarah ke badlaav, yahaan tak ki batting pojishan main bhi, ke liye taiyaar nahin hote
 Tendulkar himself was not ready to change his batting position
 sach to yah he ki yah sara jhagada senior players kii apni suvidha kaa he
 Chappell was in favor of dropping the non-performing players from the team and giving the new players a place in the team and this was the right strategy
 is niti ke kaaran hi bhartiya cricket majboot hua or usne world cap bhi jeeta
 If senior players were kept in the team for a long time simply because of their name, then in 2010 the Indian team would not have reached the highs
 baharhaal sachin kii baton ko galat tehraane kaa koi matlab nahin he, bas uski timming par prashn chinh uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Many more things have been said about Chappell, but his commitment and understanding of the game cannot be questioned
 vah ek thos peshewar khilaadi the jiske paas bhaawanaaon kii koi jagah nahin he
 His professional attitude must have hurt the senior players of that time, there is no doubt about it
 khayr in sab ke baavjood agar chapel par aaj prashn uth rahaa he to sawaalon ke ghere main wo chayankarta yani cricket board bhi he jo tab aankh munde khadaa tha
 20 Indian Army personnel lost their lives in the snowstorm (avalanche) on January 25 in Sonmarg and Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir
 javaanon kii him samadhi kaa kaaran bane is tufaan ke baar main himpat or himaskhalan adhyayan pratishthan (eseesi) ne daawa kiya he ki usne bhartiya sena ko pehle hi isse aagaah kiya tha
 Ashwaghosh Ganju, director of the institute, said, 'there are many reasons behind this ejaculation
 in himaskhalanon kaa pehle hi anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 He also said that we do not tell that there will be avalanche at this place every now and then, but its possible areas are rough estimates
 unhone kaha, 'hamane himaskhalan kii ashanka se sena ko avgat kara diya tha
 "we knew that there would be an avalanche in view of such a rapid and unprecedented snowfall," Ganju said
 isaki tivrata kaa anumaan lagaana to sambhav nahin tha, lekin hamane logon ko isaki soochna de di thi
 'however, Ganju also says,' The army has its obligations, and in such a situation i cannot say much about it
 vahiin sena se jab is babat sampark kiya, to unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 At the same time, a senior military commander admitted that 'many difficult decisions have to be taken in difficult circumstances
 'gauratlab he ki jammu kashmir main sena20 javaanon kii jaan chali gaithi
 Of these, 14 jawans became snow-capped in Gurez sector, while 5 jawans were buried under the snow due to slipping in Machil sector

 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan ke liye aatur dikh rahi aam aadmi party kii baat banate nahin dikh rahi he
 Delhi Congress President Sheila Dikshit held a meeting with party leaders today and later said that no leader is in favor of an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 shila dikshit ne kaha, 'hamane apane logon se sanghathan ko majboot karne ke liye meeting kii he
 The current situation is discussed in the meeting
 gathbandhan ko lekar bhi charchaa kii he or sabhi log dilli main gathbandhan karne ke khilaaf he
 The Congress is the strongest and oldest party
 ham meeting karte rahete hai
 It is clear from the statement of former Delhi CM Sheila Dixit that the Aam Aadmi Party is not ready to go to the Congress
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki gathbandhan ke liye ham congress se baat kar-kar ke thak gaye, lekin congress ne hamaare saath gathbandhan nahin kiya
 The Congress wants to win the BJP in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki agar mujhe ye bharosa ho jaae ki dilli main bhaajapa ko congress haraa degi to main saaton siten chhod duungaa
 Refuting her statement, Sheila Dixit said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader never approached her regarding the alliance for the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki aap ‘hataasha kii sthiti' main pahunch gai he
 Former Chief Minister Sheila said, "he did not talk to us
" vah nahin jaanate ki vah kya kah rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has reached a state of desperation
 ''vahiin jab arvind kejariwal ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane kii maang ko lekar 1 march se bhukh hadtaal par jane kaa faisla kiya to bhi shila dikshit ne unki aalochana kii thi
 He said that in view of the Lok Sabha elections, aap's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal is making 'hollow words' on the issue of granting full statehood status to Delhi
 kailash satyaarthee ji ko shanti kaa nobel puraskaar milane kii bahut-bahut badhai
 i do not know what kind of feeling i got neither when Professor Amartya Sen got this award, nor when Mother Teresa got it
 pachori sahab ko mila, tab to bilkul hi nahin laga
 But if you get it, the stomach is tickling
 wo isliye ki aap hamaare bich ke uthne-baithne vaale aadmi hai
 What your organization does, it has been seen happening in newspapers over the years
 aapke saath koun log kaam karte hai or kaise kaam karte hai, yah bhi saare log khub acchhee tarah se jaanate hai
 It means to say that you are not a person hidden in the veils of mystery, nor did you remain such a big man that your visions are rare
 ye to bilkul aise lag rahaa he, jaise bajuwale ko itnaa bada sammaan mil gaya ho
 But when i stop and think about why i am getting tickled, the deeper reasons are understood
 pehla to yah ki hamane mahanata kii baari-bharkam paribhaashaayen bana rakhi hai
 Second, we have lost the scale of weighing large things with our own eyes
 bada kaam vahi he, jo vivaadit ho, charchit ho, jiske peeche media ho or uskaa sehara pahanane vaala adaasaaj ho
 Knowing that every life is precious and in such a situation, it is a very big task to provide human life to any innocent child, we do not weigh it
 assi hajaar bandhua majdoor bacchon ko insaan kii tarah jeene kaa mauka dena vaaki bada kaam he
 We want to understand this now, when the world's greatest throne accepted it
 lekin koi badi baat nahin he
 India has always been like this
 mahakavi rabindranath thakur ke saath bhi to yahi hua tha
 In his autobiography Jeevan Smriti Rabindranath has written how for the first time at the age of 20, a gentleman in England told him that your forehead is very high
 unhen pehali baar apni tarif sunne ko mili thi
 Before that, he was considered a liability in the family
 unki kavitaaon or samvednaaon kaa mol samajhane kii haisiyat main gulam desh kaa madhyam varg nahin tha
 Even today the character of the middle class is the same
 kya pataa, jab rabindranath ko nobel mila, to bahuton ke pet main aisi hi gudagudi ho rahi ho, jaisi mujhe aaj ho rahi he
