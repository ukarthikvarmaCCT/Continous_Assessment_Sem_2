 puraani filmon ke paatro kii tarah sada jivan, ucch vichaar kii kahawat par amal karne vaale is parivaar main sab kuch sahi chal rahaa tha
 But as soon as Sharma came to know in 1997 that he had cancer, it was as if the family had a mountain of troubles
 doctoron ne kah diya ki yah rog advance stage main he or ve zyada din nahin ji paaenge
 This lower middle class family did not have enough money to provide better treatment to its leader
 is maharog ke saath saat saal tak sangharsh ne parivaar ko jaise rank bana diya
 The naughty and mischievous son of the family, Tony is always like a shadow with his father
 2004 main jab hawaldaar sharma ne dilli ke ek aspataal main dam todaa, tab bhi tony unke saath tha
 “I had to travel alone from Delhi to Amritsar with his body
 us puure safar ke dauraan main sirf yahi sochataa rahaa ki mujhe apane parivaar ke liye strang rahanaa he, thik vaise hi, jaise mere pita taumr rahe
 The struggle with the death of the ever-satisfied and happy Havildar Sharma, as if, inspired Tony to struggle in life
 parivaar or mitron ko apni asli takat maanane vaale tony ne pita kii jagah apane bhai ashok ko punjab police main anukanpa ke aadhaar par naukari dilava di or apane liye vah rasta chun liya jo use pasand tha, yani udhaas or dukhi man waalon ko hansaana

 He did not miss out on small music video shoots, working part-time in a pool parlor, sitting at the STD booth in the bitter cold and trying to earn a little extra
 tony ko apane pita se sirf halaat se ladgaye kii takat hi nahin balki seekhney kii lagan bhi mili
 He used to do serious theater during his college days and taught drama
 aaj usee tony ko duniya hansi-majaak ke paryaay kapil sharma ke naam se jaanati he
 He started as a singer and used to sing in chorus with Punjabi singers
 samay-samay par ve apni gayikee ke jalwe kamedi nits vid kapil main bhi dikhaate rahete hai
 Lata Mangeshkar has praised her song
 kapil rosemara kii jindagi kii vidambnaaon ko tahaakaa lagane kaa vishay bana dete hai
 The man is also a successful entrepreneur, with his effortless dialogues and naturalistic acting to make the audience tickle and eventually make him laugh
 unki company ke-9 ne tivi ke liye ekadam nai tarah kaa sho chunaa, jisamen actor se lekar celibrity or janata kii bhagidaari sab kuch shaamil he
 Despite being a celebrity himself, see his confession: “I am just like ordinary people
 maine ise kabhi chhipaane kii koshish nahin kii he
 Now think to yourself: how can a man who grew up eating a Amritsari chole-kulache shift to sushi (japanese dish) right away? Is kept
 is saal apni maa ko landan ghumaakar unki bhi tamanna puri kar di
 Kapil has made his profession to remove depression and sadness
 sangharshpul parlor se lekar astidi booth tak par kaam kar chuke hai
 He considers breaking the band-tied image of the comedian as his biggest challenge

 Tigmanshu said, once i said that if Saif, who has always been in cities, can play the character of Langa Tyagi, then he can do any role

 That's why people are taking my words differently

 After talks with Haryana Minister Krishna Lal Panwar and AIJASS President Yashpal Malik in a marathon meeting in Delhi, it has been decided to end the agitation which has been going on for 14 days
 tippaniyan During the meeting, Malik said that he would announce the withdrawal of the agitation at 5 pm on 19 June
 malik ne kaha, ‘haryana sarkaar ne hamaari lagbhag sabhi maangen maan lee hai or kanoon ke daayre main rahete hue hamaare sabhi muddon ko sulajhane kaa aashwaasan diya he

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Earlier, BCCI President Shashank Manohar said that he has not yet approached the government for approval and no statement in this regard is correct
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kii vigyaapan vaali sarkaar ko hataane ke naare or apni branding nahin karne ke vaade ke saath madhya pradesh main 15 saal baad satta main lautne vaali congress bhi ab apni branding main jute gai he
 In fact, in the form of loan waiver of farmers, the forms are being distributed in the state, the photo of Chief Minister Kamal Nath has been installed and BJP has objected to the form containing these pictures
 soshal media samet teji se badhate print or electronic media ke jamaane main branding behad jaruri maani jaati he, chaahe glamer world ho yaa raajnneetik dal, koi bhi is banding se achoote nahin he
 This is the reason why the Congress, which called the BJP government with advertisements, has also come down on its own branding
 kisaanon ke karjamaafee ke jo form pradesh bhar main baante ja rahe hai, usamen kamalnath kii tasviir chhapi he
 According to BJP, the branding for which Congress had refused, now the new government is seen branding itself
 bijepi pravaktaa rajnish agarwal ne kaha ki 'photo khinchvaa kar janata ko gumraah karne kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he kyonki 10 dinon main karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa karne vaali congress 10 kisaan, 10 gaanv, 10 bank ke naam pataa bataa de jinke karj maaf hue hon
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will take the entire matter to the road and protest
 shivaraj ke chitra mukhyamantri ke rup main lage the, bijepi netaa ke rup main nahin, kamalnath aap bhi mukhyamantri ho jab aapane virodh kiya tha to aapane chitra lagavane kaa kaam kyon kiya?kyon naa lagaaein photoh congressdrasal, congress ne madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bijepi par aarope lagaate ai thi ki beete 15 saalon main bijepi ne akhabaaron samet tamaam media main sivaae vigyaapan dene ke alaava koi kaam nahin kiya he
 Congress alleged that BJP spent crores of rupees in advertising
 is kaaran congress lagaataar kah rahi thi ki vigyaapan vaali sarkaar ab nahin chalegi
 After winning the election and forming the government again in the state after 15 years, the Kamal Nath government had tried to prove by not giving a single advertisement in the last about 1 month that instead of spending crores in advertisements for the next 5 years its public Will spend money in works of interest, but now the picture of Kamal Nath on the debt waiver form of farmers has given the BJP a chance to speak
 is par rajya ke jansampark or kanoon mantri pisi sharma kaa kahana kaha he ki mukhyamantri ne ek ghante ke andar hi karjamaafee ke aadesh jari kar diya tha or mantrimandal main 11 din ke andar hi yah aa bhi gaya
 If the Congress forgives the debt of the farmers, then this message should be known that Kamal Nath has done this

 Jitu Ram Manjhi, a JDU leader and former Bihar Chief Minister, has announced the formation of a new party called 'hindustani Awam Morcha' (HAM)
 maanjhi ne yah bhi kaha ki bihar ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon main unki party akele sabhi 243 siton par chunaav ladegi
 Former CM Manjhi took on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying that he is the 'enemy number one' of the new party
 jeethanram maanjhi ne patna main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main nai party banane kaa elaan kiya
 He appointed former Bihar government minister Shakuni Chaudhary as the state president of HAM
 philhal takneekee kaarnon se na to maanjhi or na hi jediu ke 17 baagi vidhayakon kaa naam nai party kii list main dikhaai diya
 Manjhi, who is holding a press conference with Shakuni Chaudhary and two rebel JDU mlas - Nitish Mishra and Anil Kumar, said, "we will soon go to the Election Commission for registration of new party HAM with a new flag
" ’maanjhi ke saath aae logon ne kaha, ‘ek baar nai party kaa registration ho jane ke baad ham iskaa hissaa ban jaaenge
 After being expelled from the JDU and removed from the chief minister's post, Manjhi and his supporting legislators formed a non-political organization called 'hindustani Awam Morcha', which was converted into a political party on Friday

 party kii bihar ikai main 108 netaaon ke naam hai
 It names former union minister Devendra Prasad Yadav, ex-mp Brahmadev Anand Paswan and former state ministers and legislators Ganesh Yadav, Ram Kumar Yadav, Om Prakash Paswan, KD Yadav and Ramchandra Prasad Singh
 input: bhashaa On July 8, 2016, when Kashmiri militants poster boy Burhan Wani was killed by security forces in an encounter
 us vakt main srinagar main tha or hafte bhar pehle amarnath yatra shuru hui thi
 i traveled up to the Amarnath Cave along both Baltal and Pahalgam routes and then traveled to various areas of the valley for reporting
 us saal id 6 yaa 7 taarikh kii hui thi or main kashmiri siwaiyon kaa swaad lene dal jhil ke paas ke bazaar main gum rahaa tha or vahiin ek bhikhaari kuch maangane aa gaya
 a fellow journalist of Kashmiri Pandit origin had then told me that Kashmiri people do not beg and outsiders (especially Bihari people) are coming and starting a practice of begging in Kashmir's rich fijn
 vaise, maine kashmir ghati main kahin makaan jhonpadanuma nahin dekhe
 Everywhere houses were made good
 jabaki isaki tulana main uttar bhartiya rajyon kaa landscape zyada tedha-medhaa he, gurbat or dhul-dhakkad se bharaa he
 Since then, this question was constantly roaming in my mind that Kashmiri people do not really beg
 And if the matter of that journalist was true, then why not ask for it? Whereas, the government figures are revealing something else about the economic situation of Kashmir
 aankade bataa rahe hai ki kashmir main 2014 ke baad se aatankwaad main ijapha hua he
 Talking only about 2018, there have been 614 terrorist incidents in Kashmir Valley
 jabaki 2014 main 222 hui thim
 In 2018 257 terrorists have been killed and in 2014 110 terrorists were piled up
 isitarah pakistan ne bhi ghati main apni gatividhiyaan tej kii hai
 Between 2016 and 2018, 398 terrorists infiltrated Kashmir
 kendriya grih rajyamantri hansraj ahir ke mutabik, 686 aatankwaadi maare gaye or 56 pakad liye gaye
 By the way, the unemployment rate in Kashmir is also much higher than the rest of the country
 paryaton ke aankade bhi gote laga rahe hai
 Unemployment rate 24 in the age group of 18 to 29 years in Kashmir
 6 fisadi he
 While this national average of 13 in unemployment
 2 fisadi he
 Between July 2016 and June 2017, 130 workdays were hit by a strike and curfew in the Valley
 isaki anumaanit laagat kareeb 13,261 karod ru
 Has been judged jahaan tak aarthik vruddhi kii baat he kashmir main vitt varsh 2017 main 8
 a growth rate of 2 percent was recorded
 jabaki isi avadhi ke liye rashtriya ausat 10
 8 percent
 kashmir kaa 2019 main rajya jidipi kariban 25 arab dollar kaa he or desh ke tamaam rajyon ke lihaaj se vikaas kii seedhi par kashmir 21wein paaydaan par he
 Tourism is also diving in the valley
 saal 2018 main kashmir main 8
 5 lakh native and foreign tourists came
 2017 kii tulana main yah 23 fisadi kam he
 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spent Rs 80,000 crore on relief and infrastructure development and health welfare and tourism after the floods in the Kashmir Valley
 kaa package diya tha
 Nevertheless, one thing is clear from these figures that the economic condition of Kashmir is bad
 sawaal he ki kya behatar aarthik vruddhi or vikaas kashmir ke naujavaanon main badhate algaav ko thaamne main kaamyaab hoga? sanket hai ki aarthik gatividhiyon ke saath hi khule man se baatcheet ke raste bhi badaye jane chahie
 The question is, does the central government have any scope of dialogue? Why are not beggars in Kashmir and people of bihar-up-jharkhand-bengal in danger in the valley despite the disintegration of the sole industry like poor economic condition, unemployment and tourism? Why do we ask for beggars after putting it? *** If you have not been able to watch and read the news throughout the day, then know here 10 big news stories of the last 24 hours

 All these presidents will be considered relatively young
 sabhi kii umr 50 se 55 ke bich he
 That is, they also have good experience of running the states
 inamen se adhiktar ke saath vivaad bhi judaa he, lekin sabhi jameen se jude hai or inkaa janaadhar bhi hai
 First of all, let's talk about Ashok Chavan
 maharashtra se congress ke do saansad jite unamem se ek ashok chavaan hai
 The Chief Minister has also lived and his father has also been the Home Minister at the Center
 magar adarsh ghotaale main inkaa naam aayaa tha
 Then his chief minister's chair had gone
 adaalat main yah maamla chal rahaa he or un par mukadmaa na chalaaya jaae ki yachika ko court ne khaarij kar diya he
 But the Congress needed a Maratha, so Ashok Chavan has been elected
 mumbai ke congress adhyaksh banaae gaye hai sanjay nirupam
 The last time he came to Congress from Shiv Sena was also an MP
 nirupam sadak par raajnneeti or apane jujharupan ke liye jane jate hai
 Raj is not behind in challenging Thackeray on the Purvanchal issue and also has the ability to gather on Juhu on Chhath
 congress ne nirupam ko mumbai kii kaman saunp kar yah tay kar diya he ki party ab yahaan par purvanchal card khilne se nahin hichakegi

 But now this matter is over
 adaalat ne inhen bari kiya he or mukadmaa bhi band kar diya gaya he

 But their anecdote is interesting
 pichley chunaav main inaki ek gaadi ke bonut main se dhuna nikalne laga jab gaadi kaa bonut kholaa gaya to usamen noton kii gaddiyaan bhari thi jisamen aag lag gai thi
 However, Reddy was not in the car at that time

 There is no dispute between Ajay Maken of Delhi and Bharat Singh Solanki of Gujarat, but the Congress has decided that the debate over who is the biggest among the leaders in Delhi should stop

 He has done a good job as a minister at the Center
 maakan ko rahul gandhi ke saath kaam karne kaa acha anubhav he
 Bharat Solanki is younger than Modwadia in Gujarat
 kai baar saansad rahe he, kandra main rajyamantri bhi rahe, yani sari niyuktiyon ko dekhakar lagata he ki yah sab rahul kii pasand hai
 Rahul is on leave
 isaki ab charchaa nahin ho rahi he
 But it seems that wherever Rahul is contemplating himself, work is going on in the Congress and before he becomes president in April, he wants to prepare his team especially in the states

 Jadeja scored 33 not out from just 25 balls with the help of 2 fours and 2 sixes
 chathe wicket ke liye kohli ke saath banaae 47 ran ke kaaran hi bharat apane nirdhaarit 20 over main 129 banane main kaamyaab ho sakaa
 Ashwin had saved his best for the final, Ashwin had performed well in this tournament so far
 virdohi tiimon ke paas unki koi kaat to nahin thi
 But he did not get much success in terms of wickets
 shaayad aswin ne apane sarvshereshth pradarshan ko final mukaable ke liye hi bachaa rakhaa tha
 In this match, Ashwin took two wickets for just 15 runs in 4 overs
 unhone shandaar form main chal rahe english ballebaaj jonathan trot or jo root ko pavilion lautaaya
 Dhoni also got him the last over of the match
 is over main england main jeet ke liye england ko 15 ran kii jarurat thi par aswin kii phiraki ke saamne angrejon ke liye yah behad hi mushkil lakshya sabit hua
 It is not only difficult to understand Mahi's strategy, it was proved in the Namikikan final match that there is hardly any expert strategist than Captain Cool on the cricket field
 dhoni ne kam score vaale is mukaable main jis tarah apane gendbaajon kaa istemaal kiya, nateeja yah tha ki ek saajhedaari ko chhodkar koi bhi bhi england ballebaaj krij par nahin jam sakaa
 Sensing the mood of the pitch, Dhoni finally used the spinners as his trump card which turned out to be a master stroke
 lagaataar ran lutaaney ke baavjood eshanth par maahi ne apana bharosa dikhaaya
 This same strategy of Dhoni changed the stance of the match
 eshanth ne apane ek over main lagaataar do wicket jhatakkar england se jeet chin lee
 The over which changed the picture of the match The 18th over of the England innings changed the entire picture of the match, and for this over, Dhoni had given the responsibility of bowling to Ishant Sharma
 comentry box main baithe cricket pandit ise badi bhul maan rahe the
 He was also right to say that, Ishant had taken 27 runs in his 3 overs so far
 aise main yah over bharat kii haar pakki kar saktaa tha par hua kuch isse thik ult
 Ishant and India had a very poor start to this over
 morgan ke balle se niklaa ek chakka or phir lagaataar do wide
 But suddenly something happened that no one expected
 eshanth ne lagaataar do gendon par eon morgan or ravi bopaara ko pavalian lautaaya
 Ishant broke the upper hand of India in the match by breaking the deadly 64-run partnership between the two batsmen
 phir rahi sahi kasar jadeja or aswin ne puri kar di
 The rain changed the pitch and bouts and swings of pitches usually occur in England
 haalanki, puure champions trophy ke dauraan aisa anubhav ikkaa-dukka maichon main hi mila
 Most of the pitches were more suitable for the Indian team
 par final mukaable ke liye istemaal kii gai birmingham kaa pich isse thik ulat thi, jo team india ke liye khatre kii ghanti thi
 But the rain changed the mood of the pitch
 pehali pari main jab bharat ne ballebaaji kii to is pich main toornament main ab tak istemaal kiye gaye anya pichon se zyada bouns tha
 But the ball was also spinning
 jab bhartiya gendbaaji kii baari ai to yah pich bharat ke terning pichon kii tarah vyavhaar karne lagi
 The spin bowlers got a tremendous turn which proved to be a trap for England
 captain dhoni ne bhi mana ki barish hone ke kaaran gend turn hone ke saath ruk-ruk kar balle par aa rahi thi
 The trio of Ashwin, Jadeja and Raina took advantage of this
 aapke hisaab se team india kii is shandaar jeet kii vajah kya he? coment box main apane vichaar likhen

 Two days ago, the Daily Telegraph reported that current coach Mickey Arthur has called on former Indian coach Chappell to address Australian players on how to stop Sachin Tendulkar from scoring runs
 report main kaha gaya he ki chapel agle saptaah pehle test team kii australian team ko sambodhit karenge
 He is a man who knows the secret of the champion (tendulkar)
 australian gendbaajon ke liye tendulkar master hai, jo kabhi unki kamajori nahin jaan paae
 According to Ganguly, earlier in 2008, Chappell was on the Australian support staff, but that did not help
 unhone kaha, yadi aap 2008 kii shrunkhlaa par gaur karo jo ki meri aakhri shrunkhlaa thi, to chapel australian sahyogi staff main the

 He did not want peace in the dressing room
 vah galati par galati karte rahe, lekin tatkaaleen captain rahul dravid main itnaa saahas nahin tha ki vah unhen (chapel) galat karne se roak saken
 The former Indian captain said it was a mistake to hand Chappell the coach position

 They are still doing well for their country

 Researcher Marte Loge of Norway University of Science and Technology has claimed in his research that 77% of his research started the lockscreen pattern from one corner while 44% started from the top left of the lock pattern screen

 jo ki ek majboot password mana ja saktaa he
 But according to Marte Loge's research, Android users use a very simple combination, which is very easy for others to guess

 aaj bankimachandra chattopadhyaay kii punyatithi he, aise main unke jivan par charchaa ke saath unke likhe par baat karnaa uchit hoga
 The special thing is that 'anandmath', the most popular work of this great writer of Bengali literature, was always at the center of controversies
 isaki vajah isamen shaamil kiya gaya geet 'vande maataram' bhi rahaa he
 Critics forget that Anandamath was a novel, not history
 haalanki yah apane parivesh se prabhavit tha or 1882 main pustak ke rup main prakashit hone se pehle 'bangdarshan' patrika main dharawahik ke rup main prakashit ho chukaa tha
 This anecdote was written in memory of the time around 1770 and around it
 bengal main baari akaal padaa tha
 At that time, the Bengal government depended on the alliance of the destitute Muslim Nawabs and the east-india Company
 iskaa virodh karte hue vahaan ke sanyasiyon ne ek andolan khadaa kar diya
 Mahendra Singh, the protagonist of the novel, leaves the village with his wife and daughter and runs for the city, but gets separated on the way
 angrej sipaahi use luteraa samaj ek sanyasi bhavanand ke saath pakad lete hai
 But both are soon freed with the help of Bhavanaand's associates
 ab bhavanand aage-aage chal rahe hai or mahendra singh unke peeche
 In the moonlight night, Bhavananda starts singing, 'vande Mataram! Sujalaan Suflaan Malayajshitalamshashyamalam Mataram
 
 
 ’vande maataram kaa sabase pehla zikr bankim chandra chatarji dwaara rachit upanyaas ‘anondomoth’ yaa ‘aanandamath’ main isi jagah miltaa he
 However, he is said to have written the first two verses of this song between 1872 and 1875
 lekin inhen sabase pehle 1881 main aanandamath ke hisse ke taur par hi prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This song later became the vital mantra of nationalist movements
 khaas baat yah ki ek taraf jahaan is upanyaas or geet kii aalochana hoti rahi, vahiin duusari taraf arvind ghosh jaise krantikari ne vandemaataram jaisi adbhut rachana ke liye bankim chandra chatarji ko 'rashtrawaad kaa rishi' jaisi upama di thi
 In the Encyclopडियाdia Britannica, Rameshchandra has written - The General Moral of the 'ananda Math' then, is that British Rule and British Education are to be accepted as the only alternative to Mussalman oppression
 arthath angreji shashan or shiksha ko sweekaar karnaa hi muslim shoshan tathaa daman se bachane kaa ekmaatr vikalp he
 Keep in mind that during the lifetime of Bankim Chandra, five editions of 'anandmath' were printed and the novelist made many amendments in each edition
 isi aadhaar par namvar singh jaise anek aalochak vidwaan maanate the ki yah sahi he ki aanandamath kii rachana pehle angreji satta ke viruddh kii gayi thi, parantu sarkari naukar hone ke kaaran angrej ‘aakaaon’ ke dabaav tathaa pralobhan ke kaaran ise sanshodhit karke muslim-virdohi bana diya gaya
 As mentioned in the Nihalchandra Sharma edited Bankim Samagra by the Hindi Pracharak Sansthan, Varanasi, Anandamath was composed during the British rule but its content is Muslim
 san 1175 bengal main bahut bhanyakar akaal padaa tha
 Against the backdrop of the same famine, this novel was composed about the incident of the saints-rebellion of Bengal
 upanyaas main likhaa he- 1174 main fasal acchhee nahin hui
 So there was a famine in 1175 - a crisis came over the Indians
 
 
 
 First, there was a fast of evening, then even half a stomach did not get food
 iske baad do-do sandhya upwas hone laga
 Whatever crop happened in Chait, it did not happen for a month
 lekin malguzaari ke afasar mohammad raza ne man main sochaa ki yahi samay he, mere tapane kaa
 He has increased ten per cent of goods
 bengal main ghar-ghar koharaam much gaya
 One of the truths associated with the song 'bande Mataram' included in 'anandamath' is that the symbols mentioned in it all belong to the land of Bengal
 jaahir he bankim agar bengal kii baat kar rahe the to duusare ilaakon kaa zikr kaise karte
 For example, in this song Bankim also mentions seven crore people, who at that time had a total population of Bengal province, which included odisha-bihar
 isi tarah jab aurbindo ghosh ne iskaa anuwaad kiya to ise 'bengal kaa raashtragit' kaa tital diya
 The famous Bangla writer Naresh Chandra Sengupta who translated 'anandamath' into English in the early 20th century wrote that after reading this song, it is sad to know that Bankim was so obsessed with Bangla nationalism that he cared about Indian nationalism
 Was not
 apni kitaab ‘vande maataram: ek geet kii jeevani’ main savyasachi bhattacharya likhte hai, ‘1905 tak vande maataram rashtravaadiyon ke liye naaraa ban chukaa tha
 Many nationalist revolutionaries themselves called it their mantra
 ’ bataate hai ki 1907 main dhaka magistrate ne ek report taiyaar kii thi
 It wrote, 'vande Mataram was the main slogan of revolutionary organizations active in East Bengal
 haalanki kabhi-kabhi ye log bharat mata kii jai bhi bolte the, lekin sanghathan kaa sadsy banane ke liye kisi bhi navaagantuk ko vande maataram kii hi shapath leni padati thi
 Savyasachi mentions one place in his book that according to the opinion of the Muslim press, Bankim hated Muslims and alienated a large community forever due to his intense communal hatred
 savyasachi ke mutabik us daur kii muslim press kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki bankim chandra chatarji kii rachanaaon main musalamaanon ko kalankit kiya gaya he
 The effect of this was that hatred for middle class Muslims grew in their minds
 bankim ko muslim virdohi sabit karne ke liye baar-baar unke sahitya ke unheen hisson ko saamne laayaa jane laga jo aapattijanak the
 It is mentioned that when Arvind Ghosh was tried on charges of rebel writing and a bombing, he and several of his companions used to declare Vande Mataram in court
 krantikari khudiram bose ko jab 1908 main ek jaj kii hatya karne kii koshish ke jurm main faansee kii sajaa mili thi, to unhone apane bayaan kii shuruyaat vande maataram se hi kii thi
 Another revolutionary Pradyot Bhattacharya was hanged in 1932 on the charge of murder of a judge, he also concluded his last message with Vande Mataram
 yah vah daur tha jab krantikari hi nahin balki vidhyaarthiyon or mazdooron ke dilon main pal rahaa aakrosh bhi vande maataram ke udghosh ke rup main paravaan chadhane laga tha
 In 1905, there was a workers' strike in a mill near Calcutta
 virodh ke dauraan vande maataram kaa naaraa lagaate do mazdooron ko police ne hiraasat main le liya
 More than nine thousand laborers working there were so angry that they gathered in front of the mill the same evening and chanted the slogan of Vande Mataram
 duusari taraf chaatr andolanon main bhi vande maataram kaa naaraa yuva khun main ubaal laa rahaa tha
 The British government blamed Vipin Chandra Pal, the leader of the Garam Dal, for this
 april 1907 main madras presidency ke ek college main vande maataram kehane ke jurm main kuch chaatro kii giraftaar hui
 In protest Vipin Chandra reached there and addressed the students
 prabhavit hokar santhaan ke adhiktar vidhyaarthiyon ne prashasan ke khilaaf baghawat kar di
 The Director of the Department of Public Education said that if Vipin Chandra did not make an impact on the delicate mind of the students, then the situation would have come under control
 jahaan ek taraf vande maataram kaa udghosh puure desh main kranti kaa sailaab taiyaar kar rahaa tha, vahiin muslim lig is naare ke kade virodh main thi
 The League said that the theme of Anand Math is anti-muslim
 haalanki anand math kaa kathanak hindu-muslim ke aapasi bair se kahin zyada shoshak ke prati shoshit ke aakrosh ke ird-gird buna gaya tha
 And therein, especially the particular part of Vande Mataram which was being talked about to be adopted as the national anthem, was far from mutual disharmony
 lekin is baat ko darkinar karte hue kattar muslim sanghathanon ne is baat ko bada mudda bana liya tha
 Intellectual Muslims did not agree with the Muslim League
 unhen lagata tha ki is sari sajeesh ke peeche angrejon kaa haath he jo donon majahabon ke bich diwaar kheenchna chaahate the
 In 1938, Congress leader Rafi Ahmed Kidwai said, "vande Mataram has been sung at the beginning of the Congress session for years and Muslims have started opposing it only since 1930
 ’ unke dwaara jari ek press vijyapti main aage kaha gaya tha, ‘janaab jinna ne congress isliye nahin chodi thi ki vande maataram geet islam virdohi he
 Rather, the reason behind his leaving the Congress was that he did not accept the concept of Swaraj
 ’1930 ke dashak main bengal ke nami lekak rijaul kareem ne vande maataram or aanandamath kii samiksha karte hue likhaa tha ki is (vande maataram) mudde par angrejon kii shah par muslim lig jo kar rahi thi uskaa mukhya kaaran tha musalamaanon ko swatantraaa sangram se baahar nikaalnaa or is tarah aazaadee ke andolan kii ekta par chot karnaa
 He wrote, 'this song gave tongue to the tongue and courage to the weak masses
 
 
 or is rup main bankimchandra ne deshavaasiyon ko ek chirkaalik uphaar diya tha
 Many people have called him (bankim) communal or anti-muslim, but the part of Bankim's personality which is said to be anti-muslim, i do not know his identity
 yah unke yug kaa chitra he
 It is a portrait of the time in which they were living and a writer should be forgiven for this
 duusari baat, yadi bankimchandra muslim virdohi the to kya isse unka saahitiyik mahatv kam ho jaataa he?’vande maataram likhaa bhale hi bankim chandra ne tha, lekin ise sabase pehle gaaya tha, jan-gana-man ke rachiyata rabindranath tagore ne
 Tagore is said to have given the first stanza of this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress of 1896 and he considered it his good fortune
 is baat kaa zikr rabindranath tagore ne 1937 main jawahar laal nehru ko likhe ek patr main kiya he
 He wrote this letter on Nehru asking his views on Vande Mataram in the face of strong opposition from the Muslim League
 is patr main tagore ne likhaa, ‘main geet ke pehle do antare puri tarah sweekaar karne ke paksh main hum
 
 
 This song has been transformed into a national song by joining the awesome sacrifices of the promising youth
 
 
 main is baat ko muktbhaav se sweekaar karata hum ki bankim kii puri vande maataram kavita agar apane sandarbh ke saath padhi jaae, to isaki vyakhya is tarah se ho sakati he ki usase musalamaanon kii bhaawanaaon ko chot pahunche, lekin isi kavita ke swat: sfoort bhav se niklaa hua rashtriya geet jisamen mul kavita ke do antare bhar hai, hamen hameshaa puri kavita kii yaad nahin dilaataa or us katha kii yaad to shaayad hi aati he, jiskaa iske saath aakasmik rup se judaav ho gaya
 This poem has separately acquired its own privacy and inspirational importance, which i do not think hurts any sect or community
 ’is patr kaa zikr karte hue savyasachi bhattacharya likhte hai ki tagore ne kavita ke nijee arth or upanyaas ke sandarbh ke bich paidaa hone vaale arth ke bich antar kiya
 Tagore made a distinction between the importance that a composition creates in the imagination of people and its importance in the original context
 jaahir tha is patr ke baad jawahar laal nehru kii duvidha kam hui or is geet ko lekar jo nirnaayak samiti bani uskaa prastaav khud nehru ne taiyaar kiya
 Nehru wrote, 'vande Mataram has become the slogan of power which inspires our people
 yah abhivadan kaa muhaavara ban gaya he jo hamen rashtriya swatantraaa ke apane sangharsh kii yaad dilaataa he
 
 
 The two stanzas of the song gradually spread (from Bengal) to the rest of the provinces and a national significance was attached to them
 geet kaa baaki hissaa kabhi-kabhaar hi upyog main aata he
 
 
 These two differences describe the beauty of the motherland and its splendor in emotional language
 
 
 yah geet kisi samooh athwa samudaay ko chunauti dene ke liye hindustan main kabhi nahin gaaya gaya, na hi isko is rup main dekha gaya athwa mana gaya ki isse kisi samudaay kii bhaawanaaon ko chot pahonchegi
 
 
 The Congress never accepted this song or any other song as the national anthem of India, but it gained special and national importance due to the popularity of the song
 
 
 ’nehru hi nahin balki mahatma gandhi bhi is geet ke bare main lagbhag vahi soch rahe the jaisaa tagore ne likhaa tha
 Gandhi was present at a meeting in Madras in 1915 which began with Vande Mataram
 tab is geet se prabhavit hue gandhi ne kaha tha, ‘aapane jo sundar geet gaaya use sunakar ham sab ekadam uchhal pade
 The poet has used all possible adjectives to express the motherland
 ab yah ham-aap par he ki kavi ne mathrubhumi ke bare main jo kaha he use saakaar karne kii koshish karen
 'but in the next 30 years, the situation worsened
 muslim lig jahaan is geet kaa jamkar virodh kar rahi thi, vahiin kuch ativaadee hindu, musalamaanon ke khilaaf vande maataram kaa aapattijanak istemaal karne lage the
 This was the reason that in July 1939, Gandhi wrote an article in his newspaper 'harijan'
 isamen unhone kaha, ‘vande maataram ek shaktishaalee yudhghosh he or main apni naujavaani ke dinon main is geet se abhibhoot tha
 
 
 i never thought that it was a Hindu song or that it was composed only for Hindus
 durbhaagya se ham ab durdin main ji rahe hai
 Nowadays, all the hard and pure gold has become like mud
 aise samay main budhimaani yahi he ki ise khare sone ke bhav nahin mitti ke hi mol bechaa jaae
 i do not want to quarrel at all on the question of singing Vande Mataram in a mixed gathering
 
 
 yah geet kabhi nispand nahin ho saktaa
 It has been written in crores of hearts
 ’gandhi jaanate the ki vande maataram kaa chaahe jitna virodh ho jaae, lekin rashtriya andolanon kaa pramukh gavaah or hissedaar rahaa yah geet bhartiya samaaj ke jehan main sadaa-sadaa ke liye amar ho chukaa he
 The song had an all-time wide spread that in a survey of BBC World Service in 2002, some 125 years after it was composed, 25000 of its listeners considered Vande Mataram as one of the two most famous songs in India
 haalanki is geet ko lekar vivaad kabhi khatm nahin hua
 The earlier BJP government of Madhya Pradesh and now the Congress government also issued a mandate to move the program of singing 'vande Mataram' by the General Administration Department of the state government on the first working day of every month with the participation of government officials / employees only
 The tax was linked to the participation of the police band and general public, while the Madras High Court in all the schools, colleges, universities of the state in the week At least once Vande Mataram song has mandated
 isi tarah isi saal bihar ke katihaar jile ke praathmik vidhyalay ke shikshak afazal hossain kaa vande maataram gane se inkaar karne kaa video soshal media par viral hua tha
 According to the news agency ANI, teacher Afzal Hussain said, 'we worship Allah and Vande Mataram means' Vandana of India', which is against our belief

 After the assembly elections in Rajasthan too, in the wake of general elections, leaders of all parties have started knocking in their constituencies

 Therefore, the RLP can spoil the equation of both the big political parties Congress and BJP
 raajnneetik prishthbhumirajasthan main marwar kii rajaniti main aazaadee ke pehle se hi mirdha parivaar kaa varchasv rahaa he
 Most of all, Baldevaram Mirdha founded the Marwar Kisan Sabha to protect the interests of the farmers
 lekin desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pan
 The Kisan Sabha merged with the Congress after mediation with Jawaharlal Nehru
 iske baad baldev ram mirdha ke bete ramanivas mirdha or unke hi parivaar ke nathuram mirdha kaa yahaan kii raajnneeti main lagbhag 6 dashak tak prabhutv rahaa
 But gradually the influence of the Mirdha family began to diminish
 lihaaja ab nai peedi apni is raajnneetik viraasat to bachaane ke liye sangharsh karti najar aa rahi he
 Hanuman Beniwal has emerged as a new player between the Congress and the BJP for some time now, who wants to draw a separate line from both these parties by taking the Jat youth along

 In this election, Ram Niwas Mirdha defeated Nathuram Mirdha from the Bharatiya Lok Dal on a Congress ticket
 lekin 1989 ke chunaav main nathuram mirdha ne janata dal se chunaav ladate hue ramanivas mirdha ko haraa diya
 In its 1991 and 1996 Lok Sabha elections, Nathuram Mirdha occupied this seat on the Congress ticket
 lekin nathuram mirdha ke nidhan ke baad 1997 ke upachunaav main bijepi ke tikat par unke bete bhanuprakash mirdha ne congress ke ramanivas mirdha ko haraakar is seat par kabja jamaaya
 This was the first time the BJP tasted victory in this seat, but the party had to take the support of the Sahara Mirdha family
 ab tak mirdha parivaar ke ird gird ghoomane vaali nagaur kii raajnneeti main ramaraghunatha choudhary entry hui
 It is believed that due to the mutual disunity of the Mirdha family, Ram Raghunath Chaudhary managed to make his place in the politics here
 1998 or 1999 main congress ke tikat par ramaraghunatha choudhary lagaataar do baar yahaan ke saansad chune gaye
 But Chaudhary lost the election to Bhanwar Singh Dangawas of BJP in 2004

 pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ne twit kiya ki main agsit pole ke gocip par bharosa nahin karti
 The game plan is to tamper with evms or replace thousands of evms through this gossip
 main sabhi vipakshi dalon se apil karti hum ki ekajute rahen, majboot or himmati rahen
 We will fight this battle together
 sabhi vipakshi partiyon ne agsit pole ke daavon ko khaarij karte hue strong room main rakhe iviem mashin par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye apane kaaryakartaaon se apil kii he
 These parties fear that evms may be tampered with
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki is chunaav main endie kii haar hogi
 The Congress government had given the right to use evms
 The Congress is making noise on evms, but during the Rajiv Gandhi regime, in December 1988, the People's Representation Act 1951 was amended and new section 61A was added, under which the Commission was empowered to use voting machines
 Given
 sanshodhit praavdhaan 15 march 1989 se prabhavi hua
 After 2001, the issue of tampering in evms was taken to various High Courts
 lagbhag sabhi adaalaton ne iviem kii takneekee sudridhtaa or prashasnic upayon ke pahaluon par gaur karne ke baad yah paaya ki bharat main iviem vishwasaneey or puri tarah chhedchhad mukt he
 The Supreme Court rejected the plea to hold elections from the ballot paper
 The Supreme Court had given a big shock to those opposing EVM machines for voting a few months back
 ballat paper se matdaan karaane kii yachika khaarij kar di thi
 However, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had said that there is a possibility of misuse of every machine
 har system par andeh jataayaa ja saktaa he
 Recently, the Supreme Court had also rejected 21 opposition parties' demand to match 50 per cent evms to the VVPAT in the Lok Sabha elections
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu samet 21 vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ne vivipat ke auchak milan ko lekar punarvichaar yachika daayar kii thi
 When the Election Commission gave a challenge to tampering of evms, but no one came forward, many political parties in the country have continuously questioned the credibility of evms
 lekin chunaav ayog lagaataar yah kahata aa rahaa he ki iviem se chhedchhad nahin ho sakati
 He even challenged those who proved tampering with evms, but no party accepted the Commission's challenge

 At the same time, Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of the BCCI president, who is under the spot fixing in the IPL, will appear before the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police today

 Earlier, Gurunath Meiyappan had sought time till Monday to inquire into the case, which was turned down by the crime branch

 kaha ja rahaa he ki mumbai police unke kai ahm sawaal to karegi hi, yadi jarurat padi to vindu daara singh se unka aamanaa-saamana bhi karaayaa ja saktaa he
 According to the information received so far from Vindu arrested by the crime branch on betting charges, Gurunath is seen to be the biggest guru of betting
 vindu ke khulaason par yakeen karen to gurunath ipel ke maujuuda sijan main kareeb 1 karod sattebaaji main ganvaa chuke hai
 Gurunath used to keep in touch with Vindu Dara Singh via mobile and used to contact bookies named Vindu Dara Singh and Pawan Jaipur

 The Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police started their search two days ago but the clever Asad Rauf probably managed to escape from India

 There is a huge scam of fixing behind this passion of India

 It will not be the heart of cricket lovers who spend thousands of rupees to reach the stadium, but this is true

 There is nothing in this game except to play with the feelings of the Indians

 But after that, the stains started, after several days of fixing the IPL, so many stains of revelations have been made that the entire gamut of the IPL has turned black
 cricket khilaadiyon se ipel main phixing or sattebaaji kaa kalank bollywood tak pahunchaa
 The stigma of stigma from Bollywood reached the underworld and now the questions from the umpire to the CEO of the team are under question

 Would it not be correct to say that after the questioning of All Is Fixed! Vindu in the IPL, many big revelations in the IPL fixing and betting everyday are pushing the cricket of passion and passion into the trough
 mumbai police ke hathe chadh chuke vindu daara singh ne kuch or naamon kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Vindu Dara Singh has confessed to good acquaintance with Harbhajan Singh (bhajji) and the 3 Chennai Super Kings cricketers

 modells ke hawaale se ye bhi khulaasa hua he ki rauf ko bhi ladkiyaan supplai kii jaati thim
 But the biggest disclosure of the questioning of the models is that TV artist Vindu Dara Singh himself used to supply girls to bookies and cricketers

 Scientists of the country have succeeded in making a plant sedwa for the treatment of dengue fever
 vishwa kii aadhi jansankhya ko dengue hone kaa khatra bana rahata he or har saal iske 400 million maamle saamne aate hai
 It also proves fatal
 ab tak isaki koi dawa yaa vaxin nahin uplabdh thi
 Currently, all the pre-trials of this drug have been done and the International Center for Genetic and Biotechnology, Science and Technology Ministry has signed an agreement with Sun Form to carry out clinical trials
 aasaan nahin tha virus kaa ilaaj dhundhanaaise project se jude mukhya vaigyanik naveen khanna ne bataaya ki pichley 10 saal se lagbhag 10 vaigyanikon kii team is par kaam kar rahi thi
 During this time 19 plants were fully studied
 sabhi mendengue ke kisi na kisi virus se hone vaale lakshanjaise bukhaar, mansapeshiyon kaa dard, sharir par laal chakaton kaa padana aadi, lekin kai trial ke baad inamen se ek paudha aisa mila jisamen dengue ko failaane ke liye jimmedaar chaaron virus se paidaa hone vaale lakshanon se ladane kii kshamta thi
 Dr
 khanna ne bataaya ki ye trial isliye bhi chunauteepurn tha ki ek virus kaa nahin balik chaar-chaar virus se hone vaali bimariyon kaa ilaaj dhundhana tha
 This is a good indication about medicine
 This plant, called Kisampalos, is also known as Small Path in Hindi and it grows in large numbers in many areas of South as well as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is paudhe kii pattiyon ko sukhaakar iskaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he or ek kilo pattiyon se hamen 100 gram dawa banane kii saamagree mil rahi he jo ek bahut acha sanket he
 It has been seen many times that only 1 or 2 grams of goods are available to make a medicine out of two kilos, so during the research, we have never had any problem with the material and hope that there will be no more
 chaar main bazaar main uplabdh honge capsulephilhal quinical trial ke dauraan is dawa se hone vaali toxicity yani ye kitni jahrili ho sakati he iskaa pareekshan pashuon par kiya jayega or safalataa milane par maanav trial shuru hoga
 Scientists are hopeful that in the coming four years, they will introduce capsules in the market for dengue treatment and it will be a revolution
 100 se zyada deshon main he dengue kaa khatraapako ye jaanakar hairaani ki varsh 1970 se pehle dengue keval 9 deshon main failata tha lekin aaj-kal 100 se zyada desh isaki chapet main aa chuke hai
 It is truly dangerous for India in every way, it does not know how many people fall prey to death every year, rather statistics show that it costs 500 million every year to treat the people suffering from it, as well as people not going to work
 The same amount of damage is done and the Ministry is also making preparations for making this medicine in the country and making it possible for private public partnership (PPP)

 Islamic extremists in Northeast Nigeria have intensified deadly attacks in recent months
 suryoday ke baad motorcycle par savaar bandookdhaariyon ne borno rajya ke kamuya gaanv par hamalaa bol diya
 The attackers opened fire on the local citizens on the weekly market

 At the same time, these attacks also reflect the weak grip of the Nigerian Army on security
 pichley saal may se borno or do padosi purvottar rajyon main apatkaal kii sthiti paidaa bani hui he
 Local resident Bala Mashelia told AFP, they came riding on motorcycles and they blocked all the routes going inside the village

 Most of these people were traders from neighboring villages who came to the market
 unhone 24 logon ko maar diya or phir chale gaye
 We are sure that the attackers were people from Boko Haram
 mishelia ne telephone par bataaya ki aatankit nivasee or adhik hamalon ke dar se gaanv chhodkar paas ke shahar biu chale gaye
 Dawood Ibrahim, another resident, also gave a similar account of the incident, saying the gunmen said they would return for more attacks
 hamen laga ki apni jindagi bachaane ke liye hamen ye jagah chhodani hogi
 Bokoharam has increased attacks within Borno
 gaanvon par dhaava bolkar ve nivaasiyon kii hatya karte hai, bhojan kaa saamaan lutate hai or gharon main aag laga dete hai
 According to data provided by local citizens, on Wednesday suspected terrorist attackers attacked four villages in two districts of Borno State killing 34 people
 somvaar, mangalvaar or buudhvaar ko teen alag-alag hamalon main 50 se zyada log maare gaye
 Two of these attacks occurred near the remote city of Chibok in Borno, from where the girls were abducted

 It is about July 1991
 altitii ke bhedie jayakumar ne sibiai ke vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) ko raaj kii baat bataai
 Sri Lankan Tamil, suspected of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination on 21 May 1991, was the chief investigator of the CBI
 raghottaman ko chennai ke kodungayur ilaake main 158 mutamil nagar ke altitii kii mahfuj panaahagaah main kichan ke farsh ke neeche ek gadde kii jaankaree di
 In September 1990, the ltte's intelligence wing housed several people in this Tamil Nadu hideout
 jayakumar unamem se ek tha
 Nobody in them knew what was in that pit
 lekin gaddha kuch khaas tha, iskaa andaja jayakumar ko tha kyonki mukhya sandigdh 33 varshiya shivarasana ko jab bhi usamen kuch kaam hota, vah jayakumar ko vahaan se baahar bhej detaa
 The SIT, formed a day after the assassination, attacked and razed the house in a suburb of Chennai
 badi safai se kichan main 2 foot lambii or 2 foot chaudee tile ke neeche banaae gaye teen foot gahare andhere gadde main moti tamil-angreji dictionari thi jiske bhitari pannon ko katkar 9 mem kii pistaul chhipaai gai thi
 Apart from this, two small pocket diaries, a notebook and a fake eye of glass were also found in it
 pehali najar main diariyon or notebook ke pannon main tamil or angreji main shivarasana kii ghasitu handriting main likhi baton se kuch khaas pataa nahin chalaa
 It contained telephone numbers, addresses, code names of the contacts and random information of transactions
 lekin, shuru main abujh paheli-si lag rahi har pravishti kaa jab saavdhaanee se vishleshan kiya gaya or ek-duusare se joda gaya, to yah choti-si notebook 20veen sadi ke shaayad sabase ulajhau hatyakand kii gutthiyaan kholane kii kunjee lagane lagi
 "this notebook proved to be the most important seizure for us," says Raghottaman
 usase hamen pataa chalaa ki shivarasana kaa duusare sah-abhiyukton se kya sambandh rahaa he
 In these diaries, Sivarasan along with a nine-member assassin squad had been filing entries in Tamil Nadu on May 1, 1991, till May 23, two days after the assassination
 uske baad vah apni team ke saath bangaloru bhaag gaya tha or pakade jane ke dar se usne khudakushi kar lee thi
 These pages of diaries became strong evidence against the accused in the court, but they were never made public before
 ye diariyaan hi rajeev hatyakand ke sabhi aropiyon murugan, santan, perarivalan, nalini, jayakumar, ravichandran or robert paayas kaa dosha siddh karne main ahm sakshya sabit huin
 Today, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu J

 The Center filed an appeal in the Supreme Court on 24 February against Jayalalithaa's 18 February decision to release her
 rihaai rokane kii centre kii pahal par jayalalita ne kaha, ‘‘jo bhi kanoonee taur par sambhav hoga, ham vah sab karenge
 "in this short answer, it is implied that this confrontation will continue till the end of the Lok Sabha elections in May
 haalanki 27 farvari ko tamilnadu sarkaar ke in logon kii rihaai ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali centre sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne chaar anya doshiyon nalini, robert paayas, jayakumar or ravichandran kii rihaai par roak laga di
 The Supreme Court will hear the petition on 6 March
 adaalat 20 farvari ko teen anya kii rihaai par roak kaa aadesh pehle hi jari kar chuki thi
 The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi on 21 May 1991, just before the Lok Sabha elections, two decades ago, is the country's most sensational political assassination
 us vakt tamilnadu main congress kii chunavi sahyogi jayalalita hi thim
 The assassination was planned by the war-ravaged LTTE kingpin Velupillai Prabhakaran in the early 1990s in the jungles of Sri Lanka
 prabhakaran tab badale kii bhaavana se gusse main tha
 The Indian Army's controversial campaign to implement the indo-sri Lanka Accord of July 1987 had just ended
 bhartiya sena ko us dauraan usee altitii se laduya padaa jise desh kii khufia agency ro ne khadaa kiya tha
 In this, hundreds of LTTE people were killed and on one occasion Prabhakaran was also saved
 altitii kaa badalaab badale kaa vakt tha
 Prabhakaran, the prime minister he felt cheated on, was out of power so it was easy to target him
 sibiai ke jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik prabhakaran apni yojana par amal karne ke liye fouran jute gaya
 Raw, who had remained in touch with the LTTE until then, did not realize what revenge felt in the LLTE
 prabhakaran or uske khufia pramukh 29 varshiya shanmuglingam shivashankar urf ‘‘pottu amman’’ ne apane ‘‘blike tiger suicide squad’’ se teen mahila aatmghaatee bam hamalaavaron kii talash kii
 They chose only five-foot-four-inch bodybuilders and the prodigal Pakiachandran alias Sivarasan, who had a left eye in 1987 in a skirmish with the Sri Lankan army
 vah sabhi dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon ko bolne main paarangat tha
 The LTTE became more effective after its attack in Chennai in 1990, killing Padmanabhan, the leader of the pro-india Tamil Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, and 13 of his associates
 yah puri tarah intelligence se judaa abhiyaan tha, jisamen altitii ke bhedie chennai aae or padmanabhan kaa pataa laga liya
 Now Sivarasan was given the responsibility to carry out the assassination of Rajiv and also make sure that the LTTE does not bear the blame
 ise khufia shabdaawalee main suraag na chhodie vaala opareshnya kaha jaataa he
 For example, in 1988, Pakistan President zia-ul-haq was killed in a plane explosion and every clue of the crime or criminal was erased in the blast
 altitii netritv 1991 ke chunaavon ke liye congress ghoshnaa-patr main 1987 ke bharat-srilanka samjhaute par patibaddhta se pareshaan tha
 Sivarasan and his killer squad reached Tamil Nadu on 1 May 1991 and immediately got involved
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa ho chuki thi or 20 may se ye shuru hone the
 Rajiv Gandhi, a 'wedding' from Tamil Nadu, was almost certain to campaign in Tamil Nadu where the LTTE was to target him
 shivarasana ke daste main do behad ahm sadsy aatmghaatee maanav bam dhanu or kisi bhi tarah kii vipareet sthiti ke liye vikalp ke taur par duusari maanav bam shubha the
 She was going to participate in "shaadi"
 altitii ne hatya kii yojana kaa yahi kuta naam rakhaa tha
 Sivarasan was constantly in contact with radio sets and code language from the LTTE base in the jungles of Sri Lanka
 jayakumar or uskaa rishtedaar robert paayas jaise altitii ke kaaryakarta pehle hi chennai or uske aas-paas kiraye par makaan le chuke the
 Sivarasan had been constantly changing the house to avoid being identified even while looking for an opportunity to attack the former Prime Minister
 vah kuta bhashaa main lagaataar prabhakaran or pottu amman ko ‘‘shaadi kii taiyaariyon’’ kii jaankaree detaa ja rahaa tha
 The LTTE transported five kilograms of gold to Tamil Nadu through smuggling
 ise shivarasana ne 19
 36 lakhs
 main bechaa
 The entire campaign was spent with this money
 masalan, do maheene tak hotel ke kiraye se lekar, bhediyon ko bhugtan or hamalavar daste kii yatra kaa kharch vagairah
 Sivarasan recorded the telephone number, reconciliation with the conspirators and the payment given to them
 uske bhediyon ko pehali kamyaabi chennai se 40 kimi dur shreeperambudur se congress saansad maragatham chandrashekhar kii andruni mandali main pravesh ke saath mili
 Chandrasekhar had a very close relationship with the nehru-gandhi family
 dilli kii sajeeshashivarasana ne duusari sajeesh ke bare main bhi apni diariyon main likhaa tha
 This second plan was prepared in case Tamil Nadu could not reach Rajiv
 28 april ko ek dubli-patali, ghunghraale baalo vaali 18 saal kii atirai naam kii ladki tamilnadu main altitii ke gupt bandargah par jafana se aakar utarati he
 He is taken to the shelter of Chennai
 vahaan use nai dilli main rajeev ko unke hi ghar ke pichhawaade maarane ke altitii ke plan bi ke liye intjaar karnaa tha
 Adhaira was not chosen simply because she was known as Sonia in the LTTE, but her color was light and she could easily mix with the people of Delhi
 shivarasana is kaam main srilanka sarkaar ke sevanivrutt adhikari kangasabapati ko pehle hi laga chukaa tha
 The aged 70 was the father of the deceased LTTE commander
 hatyare daste kaa yah sabase umradraj sadsy dilli aakar tamilnadu ke emdmake ke netaa vaayako se jude altitii samarthak se sampark saadh chukaa tha
 Together they both sought a shelter in Delhi for their mission
 yah north motibagh main makaan number e-233 tha
 The house was searched through a property dealer in Shanti Niketan, a neighborhood
 centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke liye bana do kamare kaa yah kaa makaan ekadam surakshit tha
 It was illegally leased
 yah rajdhani ke bichobich sarkari karmchaariyon ke single story mohalle main tha or rajeev gandhi ke ghar 10 janpath se mahaj aath kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Kanagasabapati paid the property dealer Rs 5,000 for it
 advance main die the
 He told the property dealer, "my granddaughter will be here for a few days
" ’’ usne bataaya ki atirai rajdhani main hindi or computer siikhnaa chaahati he
 Though Sivarasan had created a separate assassin squad for Delhi, he was confident that Rajiv's assassination would be carried out in Tamil Nadu
 pottu amman ise dilli main anjaam dene kaa tagada himachati tha
 In a coded message in May 1991, he had asked Sivarasan, "why not in Delhi?" Sivarasan replied, "i'm sure i can do it here (in Tamil Nadu)
" ’’ lekin pottu amman dilli main kaam puraa karne par jor de rahaa tha
 The Delhi plan was abandoned as the LTTE managed Sriperumbudur in its plan
 kangasabapati or atirai ko june 1991 main paharkunj ke hotel se pakadaa gaya
 They were planning to go to Nepal
 unhen aath saal jail kaatane ke baad 1999 main reeha kar diya gaya kyonki supreme court main shreeperambudur yojana se unka koi sambandh sthapit nahin kiya ja sakaa
 He later moved to Switzerland
 yah yojana to vaise chhod di gai lekin isse rajeev gandhi kii hatya ko lekar altitii ke drudh iraadon kaa pataa chalata he
 "it was not easy for him to escape if Prabhakaran ordered the assassination of Rajiv," says Raghottaman
 ’’shreeperambudur main hamalaeltitii kaa hatyara dasta 21 may ko rajya parivahan nigam kii bas main rajeev gandhi kii chunavi raily vaali jagah par pahunchaa or behad sakht suraksha vaale kshetra main pahunch gaya
 Sivarasan hung the bag in a white kurta-pajamé with a notepad in his hand as a journalist
 dhanu hare or gulabi rang kii dhili-dhaali salwar-kameez main thi
 During the hour-long trip to Sriperumbudur, Dhanu told Nalini that just a little to see what is tied under her clothes, she started to sweat
 tab raily sthal par na metal detector the, na jaanch-padtaal kii koi vyavastha
 Nalini was strong and strong
 usne angreji main eme kiya tha
 She was working as an officer's personal assistant in a private firm in Chennai and fell in love with Murugan
 vah or shubha is maanav bam dhanu ke saath-saath chal rahi thim
 Night 10
 20 baje rajeev gandhi shreeperambudur ke mandir maidan main bichhe coir ke galeeche par aage bad rahe the
 He was exhausted due to his busy campaigning in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh
 vahaan pahunchane par samarthakon kii utsaahi bheed ne unka swaagat kiya
 a child dressed in white and wearing a tricolor around his neck was also present there
 dhanu ne rajeev ko chandan kii maala pahanaai or maano pair chune ke liye unke pairon kii ore jhuki
 Bending down, he pressed the switch on his right side and a massive explosion occurred in a pound of plastic explosives
 rajeev gandhi or 17 log vahiin maukey par hi maare gaye
 Shivarasan and his companions then disappeared in a stampede
 baad main esaity kii aguai karne vaale di
 R
 kartikeyan ise ‘‘behisaab chaturaai, achook yojana or thos amal kii misaal’’ bataate hai
 Under his leadership, the SIT finally settled the issue
 ek camera or diariyanis hatyakand kii sajeesh kaa shaayad isaki yojana ke mutabik, kabhi khulaasa nahin ho paata, agar haribabu kaa 35 mem kaa canan camera na mila hota
 Photographer Haribabu was killed in the blast
 use shivarasana ne kiraye par bulaayaa tha
 His last photograph with the police was Sivarasan and the entire killer squad
 july 1991 tak kartikeyan kii esaity ne zyaadaatar pramukh sandigdhon ko pakad liya tha
 His team reached the single storey house at Konankunte on the outskirts of Bangalore looking for clues
 use gher liya gaya lekin 19 agast ko puure altitii daste ne khudakushi kar lee
 Two days after the assassination, Sivarasan left Chennai with a 7 mm pistol and diaries were left there
 use shaayad yakeen tha ki vah lautakar diariyaan le legaa
 When the commando cordon was sealed, Sivarasan shot him in the head with a pistol
 esaity ko vahaan jalaae gaye dastavejon, film kii negative vagairah kii raakh bhi mili
 Many of them had pictures of every step of tying explosives in Dhanu's body
 esaity ne 1,044 gavaahon, 10,000 pannon ke bayaan or 10,477 dastavej bataur saboot or 1,180 vasteen court main pesh kin
 Among them were diaries of Sivarasan
 maamle kii sunwaayee janvari,1994 main shuru hui thi
 Why did the LTTE squad leave documentary evidence behind? SIT investigators attribute this to ltte's tendency to document its conflict
 altitii ke paas ‘‘nitarasanam’’ naamak atyaadhunik yuddh ke dauraan kaam karne vaali camera unit thi
 "the LTTE people used to keep an account of every penny and take pictures of all the activities so that the workers could be energized," says Raghottaman
 ’’ dastavej rakhane kii isi pravriti ne hatya kii is jaghanya sajeesh kaa raaj bhi khol diya
 This massacre also determined Prabhakaran's fate
 isse altitii ke liye tamilnadu kaa istemaal band ho gaya
 In May 2009, the Sri Lankan Army surrounded LTTE leaders Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman and its cadre and destroyed their hideout

 a case of attempting to tamper with the telephone line of the Indian Embassy in the US has come to light
 duutavas kii telephone line main chhedchhad kar logon ko thagne kii koshish kii gai he
 Some people told the embassy that they had made fake calls, stating that some people were asking for money in the name of passports, visas
 farji kol kii kai shikaayatein aane par bhartiya duutavas ne america kii sarkaar ko is babat jaankaree di he
 At the same time has started investigation of this fraud
 iske saath hi duutavas ne ek adwijuri jari kar di he jisamen logon se kaha gaya he ki ve aisi kisi bhi kol se sachet ho jaaen jisamen passport, vija, imigration form main galati kaa hawala dete hue use thik karaane ke evaj main paise lene ke liye kaha ja rahaa he
 Vicious are also asking people for their credit card information in return for this work
 aisa na karne par vija cancil hone kii baat kahkar logon ko daraaya ja rahaa he
 The embassy came to know about this 'game' when the victims of similar calls called the embassy themselves and asked for information about it
 kuch logon ne bataaya ki frod kol karne vaale phone par kehete hai ki unhen duutavas se jaankaree mili he aapke vija main gadabadi he
 Get it fixed, otherwise the visa can be canceled
 kuch kol main ye kaha jaataa he ki gadabadi kii shikaayat bharat main sambandhit adhikariyon se mili he
 On these complaints, the embassy has started collecting information about the Western Union account number and the accounts in which the money was being deposited
 bhartiya duutavas ne is babat jari adwijuri main saaf kaha he ki log aisi kol se saavdhaan rahen
 Even if there is such a disturbance, the embassy demands any kind of document by official mail
 logon se unki vyaktigat jaankaree nahin maangi jaati he
 This is probably the first time that the Indian Embassy keyphone line has been tampered with in the US
 america sarkaar se jude ek adhikari ne bataaya ki isse pehle bhi unhen kai duutavaason se aise farji kol kii soochna mili thi
 He said that more such calls came from European countries
 unka kahana tha ki ab is tarah se chhedchhad karnaa behad aasaan ho gaya he
 Detection of such calls has also become extremely difficult
 bharat se bhi aisi kai farji kol kii shikaayatein mil chuki hai, jo america logon ko kii gai hai
 Many people have also been arrested in this connection

 But the story that's written for the— rajamouli ss (@ssrajamouli) October 25, 2015two parts will not be dragged for the sake of it
 This story will conclude with the second part itself
 Baahubali-3 will be done in a way— rajamouli ss (@ssrajamouli) October 25, 2015 agar aap air india kii flite main hai to ho saktaa he aap bhi un dardanaak palon ke sakshi ban jaaen jo somvaar ko tamaam logon ne dilli airport par mahasoos kiye
 Air India has 60 Airbus A320 airplanes in its fleet
 in jahaajon ko udaane vaale tamaam payalton kaa kahana he ki inamen se 15 itane puraane hai ki jo udne laayak nahin hai
 In March this year, several Air India pilots told the Civil Aviation Regulator DGCA, 'the classic A320 ships are almost 26 years old and are the oldest' old 'in the world too, the experiment is going on continuously
 vah bhi tab, jab inamen kai baar kharabiyaan aati ja rahi hai
 This creates anxiety about security on many occasions
 in payalton ne dijisie se maang kii he ki yatriyon kii suraksha ke maddenjar in jahaajon ke parichaalan par roak lagaai jaani chahie
 ' bataa den ki e 320 jahaajon kii pehali khep 1989 main kharidi gai thi
 The 15 ships purchased at that time are currently proving to be the most dangerous in terms of flight
 somvaar ko kareeb 150 yatriyon ko lekar ud rahe ek aise hi jahaaj ne jab dilli airport par landing kii tab uske pahie main aag lag gai thi
 All the passengers were evacuated safely after much struggle
 yatriyon ko baahar nikaalane kii prakriya main kuch ko chotein bhi aa gayi
 When the Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Mahesh Sharma was asked in this matter, he said that to say that A320 has become dangerous is completely wrong
 unhone kaha ki aircraft kii umr 3 ho yaa 26 isse koi fark nahin padataa
 Before the flight of every aircraft, it is checked whether it is worth flying and the flight is allowed only after the certificate is issued
 udhar, enditivi ko jaankaree mili he ki janvari main dijisie ne e 320 kii udaanon ko simit karne ke liye kade nirdesh jari kiye hai
 The DGCA issued these instructions after it found that many a times there were complaints of their engine malfunction in the air
 tippaniyan NDTV has also looked at the instructions stating that such ships have been asked to take off at the nearest airport as soon as one of the two engines stops
 in jahaajon ko aise margon par udaan se rokane ke bhi nirdesh hai jin margon par kisi aakasmik sthiti main ek ghante ke bheetar airport par landing sambhav na ho
 At the same time, for new ships of this type, this time is three hours
 yah bhi tathy saamne aayaa he ki kareeb teen saal pehle air india ke payalton ne puraane pad chuke e 320 jahaajon kii shikaayat kii thi
 The pilots said in their complaint that the radar of these ships is of very old technology which is unable to analyze the weather accurately
 isi saal march main air india ke kai payalton ne civil aviation regulator dijisie se kaha, 'clasik e 320 jahaaj kareeb 26 saal puraane ho gaye hai or duniya main bhi sabase 'buudhe' hai, kaa prayog lagaataar jari he
 That too, when there are many faults in them
 isse anek maukon par suraksha ko lekar chintaa paidaa ho jaati he
 These pilots have demanded from DGCA that the operation of these vessels should be banned in view of safety of passengers
 ' Let us know that the first consignment of A320 ships was purchased in 1989
 us samay kharide gaye 15 jahaaj vartmaan main udaan kii drushti se sabase khatarnaak sabit ho rahe hai
 On Monday, when a similar flight carrying about 150 passengers landed at Delhi Airport, its wheel caught fire
 sabhi yatriyon ko kaaphi jaddojahad ke baad surakshit baahar nikaala gaya
 Some also suffered injuries in the process of evacuating passengers
 jab naagarik uddyan ke maamle ke rajya mantri mahesh sharma se is maamle main baat kii gai to unka kahana tha ki yah kahana ki e 320 khatarnaak ho gaya he, puri tarah galat he
 He said that the age of the aircraft is 3 or 26 it does not matter
 har aircraft kii udaan se pehle, vah udne laayak he yaa nahin, isaki jaanch hoti he or certificate jari hone ke baad hi udaan kii ijaajat di jaati he
 On the other hand, NDTV has received information that in January, DGCA has issued strict instructions to limit A320 flights
 dijisie ne yah nirdesh tab jari kiye jab usne paaya ki kai baar hawa main inke ingine main kharabi aane kii shikaayat aati rahi
 The comments enditivi ne un nirdeshon ko bhi dekha he jo yah bataa rahe hai ki aise jahaajon ke liye kaha gaya he ki jaise hi do main se ek ingine band ho jaataa he, use najadik ke hawaii adde par utaar diya jaae
 There are also instructions to stop these ships from flying on routes on which the landing at the airport is not possible within an hour in an accidental situation
 vahiin, is prakaar ke nae jahaajon ke liye yah samay teen ghanton kaa hota he
 It has also come to light that about three years ago Air India pilots complained of outdated A320 ships
 payalton ne apni shikaayat main kaha ki in jahaajon kaa radar kaaphi puraani takanic kaa he jo mausam kaa sahi vishleshan karne main aksham he

 However, Rahul did not regret the 84 riots
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main ek tarah se modi ke pratidwandvi maane ja rahe rahul ne kaha ki vah modi se dare hue nahin hai or congress bijepi ko parrast karegi
 'gujarat government was involved in 2002 riots' Attacking Modi directly, Rahul said,' The truth is that innocent people were killed in 1984 and innocents killed is a terrible thing that should not happen
 gujarat or 1984 main antar yah he ki 2002 ke dangon main gujarat kii sarkaar shaamil thi
 During an interview on a news channel, when Rahul was asked why he is holding him responsible when the court gave him a clean chit, the Congress vice president said, "he was the chief minister when the Gujarat riots took place
" 
 gujarat sarkaar darasal dangon ko or bhadkaa or badha rahi thi
 Underlining the difference between the role of governments in Delhi's anti-sikh riots and Gujarat riots, Rahul said, "the simple difference is that in 1984 the government was not involved in the genocide
" gujarat main vah shaamil thi
 He said that in 1984 the Congress government was not inciting or helping the riots, rather the government tried to stop the violence
 jab rahul se phir se jor dekar poocha gaya ki vah gujarat dangon par modi par nishaanaa kaise saadh sakate hai to unhone kaha, ‘yah main nahin, badi sankhya main logon ne dekha ki dangon main gujarat sarkaar sakriyata se shaamil thi
 "there is no need to apologize for the 1984 riots," Rahul said, "I mean people saw it
 main un logon main nahin hum jinhone ise dekha
 Your colleagues saw it
 aapke sahyogiyon ne mujhe bataaya
 He saw the administration actively attacking minorities
 ’ yah puche jane par ki kya vah 1984 ke dangon ke liye maafee maangenge, yaa vah yah mahasoos karte hai ki isaki koi jarurat nahin he, rahul ne kaha, ‘sabase pehle, main in dangon main bilkul bhi shaamil nahin tha
 It was not that i was part of it
 ’ isi ke saath unhone sweekaara, ‘kuch congressi log 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon main sambhavat: sanlipt the or iske liye unhen sajaa di gai he
 Asked if he would apologize on behalf of the Congress party, he said, "I think these riots were a horror like all riots
" khulkar kahuun to main congress party ke kriyakalapon (oparation) main shaamil nahin tha
 Rahul was asked if he agreed with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's view that Modi led the 'massacre' of innocents on the streets of Ahmedabad, adding, "what the Prime Minister is saying is fact
" gujarat main yah hua or log maare gayi
 "is Rahul refraining from accepting Modi's challenge? Asked if he is avoiding a direct confrontation with Modi by not becoming a Prime Ministerial candidate from the Congress, Rahul said," To understand this question, You have to understand something, who is Rahul Gandhi, and then you will get an answer to the question of who Rahul Gandhi is afraid of and who is not

 He said that the Congress is 'ready for war' and is 'winning'
 'haar kii luungaa jimmedaari'yah puche jane par ki agar congress chunaav nahin jitati he to kya vah isaki jimmedaari lenge, rahul ne kaha, ‘agar ham nahin jite, main party kaa upaadhyaksh hum, main jimmedaari luungaa
 On Modi being made the prime ministerial candidate, he said, 'BJP believes in focusing power with one person
 main isse moulik rup se asahmat hum
 i believe in democracy
 main vyavastha ko kholane main vishwaas rakhata hum

 Meanwhile, the Delhi BJP has said that the Chief Minister's candidate has not been decided at present

 Gadkari has said that no decision has been taken on the chief ministerial candidate and the reports of the removal of the state president are wrong
 vijay goyal pradesh adhyaksh bane rahenge
 Gadkari's statement will make Goyal sleepy, but the difficulties are not over, because the anti-goyal leaders are not doing anything to create an atmosphere against him within the party
 isiilie ab chaukanne goyal ne bhi gend gadakari ke paale main hi daal di he
 Delhi leaders like Vijender Gupta, VK Malhotra, Harshvardhan and Aarti Mehra have been angry ever since Goyal was crowned as state president and that is now pressurizing the party leadership to declare the CM candidate

 The war on credit has started even before the noida-greater Noida Metro inauguration
 samaajawaadee party or bijepi donon hi metro kaa credit lenaa chaahati hai
 Even before Yogi Adityanath has to start this metro, Samajwadi Party has given credit to Akhilesh Yadav government by putting up hoarding-posters all over Noida
 samaajawaadee party kii ore se lagaae gaye hordings main likhaa he ki yogi sarkaar ko punah akhilesh ke kaamon kaa feeta kaatane par badhai
 Project under Akhilesh's time: In the Akhilesh Yadav government, about 80 percent of the work of this project was completed, but the government of Yogi Adityanath came before the rest of the work was completed
 uske baad kaam saamaanya dhang se hi chalata rahaa
 For the past 1 month, this metro corridor was fully ready and was waiting for the dates of the chief guests for the inauguration

 us vakt to samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon ne bhi 1 din pehle us pul kaa udghaatan kar diya tha jisko lekar jamkar vivaad hua tha
 Home buyers are also angry

 yogi sarkaar ke satta main aane ke baad unase yah vaada kiya gaya tha ki chand dinon main hi unhen unke flats kii chaabi mil jaaegi
 However, the government's target of giving keys to 50,000 flats is still far behind and in such a situation, buyers of many big projects are now angry with the Yogi government for demanding their flats
