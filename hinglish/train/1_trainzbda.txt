 a government source said this was an unintentional omission as the JF-17 resembles India's light combat aircraft Tejas and it is difficult for a common citizen to distinguish between the two aircraft
 haalanki, galati kaa ehsaas hone par ise turant hataa liya gaya
 The JF-17 has been developed jointly by Pakistan and China and both countries are strongly encouraging this aircraft to get the order of supply globally

 jeef-17 ko pakistan or china dwaara milakar viksit kiya gaya he or donon hi desh vaishvik str par aapurti kaa order hasil karne ke liye is vimaan ko kaaphi protsaahit kar rahe hai
 The comments dilachasp he ki jeef-17 ke liye baatcheet karne vaale desh srilanka ne is vimaan ko khaarij kar diya he or ab uski najar tejas par he

 According to Satyendra Jain, if water is filled in 58 places this time, it is a good thing

 Well, in a few minutes of rain, these bad roads of Delhi exposed all the government arrangements
 meghalaya kii ek mahila ko dilli ke ek hai class club ke dianing room se nikal diya gaya
 That is also because the woman was wearing a traditional 'khasi' dress

 The club's mistress stated that Taelin Lyngdoh was wearing Jansem
 jo paramparaagat taur par 'khaasi' samudaay kii mahilaayein pahenti hai
 The mistress of the club, Dr
 nivedita barthakur sondhi ko 25 june ko dilli ke dil main sthit dilli golf club main yahaan ke ek sadsy ne aamantrit kiya tha

 Lyngdoh told that while she was taking food, she was asked to leave
 lingadoh ke anusaar manager ne unase kaha ki 'isaki ijaajat nahin he, aapako baahar janaa hoga
 He said that i went out but it was very sad to hear such a thing

 She said that she went to many places but had never heard such remarks

 The club later issued a statement saying that the host of the banquet had apologized

 On the Facebook post, Sondhi wrote, Lyngdoh, a proud woman who traveled from London to UAE in Jansem in traditional clothes

 Chief Minister of the capital Delhi Arvind Kejriwal was attacked again
 dilli ke sultanpuri main road sho ke dauraan laal tii-shart pahane suresh naam ke ek shaks ne siem kejariwal ko thappad maaraa
 After this, a round of accusations started in the political corridors
 aam aam aadmi party ke netaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha, 'ab tak kaa jo aankada rahaa he yaa jab-jab is tareeke ke hamale hue, zyaadaatar aise log bhaajapa kii vichaardhaara or modi ji ke prashansak rahe hai, haalanki abhi tak hamaare paas koi jaankaree nahin he
 He also said that there is a lot of hatred within the BJP people
 'manish sisodiya ne twit karte hue likhaa- kya modi or amit shah ab kejariwal kii hatya karwaanaa chaahate hai? iske alaava AAP saansad sanjay singh ne twit karte hue modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he
 Do Modi and Amit Shah want to assassinate Kejriwal now? Having put in all the strength for 5 years, whose morale could not be broken, he could not be defeated in the elections
 
 Now you want to get him out of the way like this, Cairo! This is your time Kejriwal
 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia)may 4, 2019
 Repeated lapse in security of @arvindkejriwal Is the Modi government waiting for a big attack on @arvindkejriwal? Or is there a big conspiracy? Https: / / t
 co / hwhy4qxv8x— Sanjay Singh AAP (@sanjayazadsln)may 4, 2019dilli bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne media se baatcheet karte hue kaha, 'bhartiya janata party ghatana kii bahut ninda karti he, ham kabhi bhi hinsa main vishwaas nahin rakhte or is tarah kii koi bhi karrwai kisi tarah se kiya gaya ho uski ham ninda karte hai
 He further said that we have also got to see that the Aam Aadmi Party has changed its campaigns and its hoardings and now they are moving away from the full state and the old rag that they are not letting us work
 unka prachaar campagne badla he, isliye mujhe shaq he ki ye thappad maravaanaa bhi kahin unka khud kaa script to nahin, kyonki jab bhi chunaav aata he inako thappad maarane vaale pataa nahin kahaan se aa jate hai
 Although we do not support such incidents, we still have doubts
 'vahiin, AAP netaa aatishi ne twit kiya, aaj kejariwal par hamalaa is baat kaa sanket he ki bhaajapa ruk sakati he! unhone 2015 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav se pehle bhi yahi kiya tha or saal 2015 main aam aadmi party ne 70 main 67 siten jiti thi or phir bijepi kaa ye hamalaa darshata he ki aap party ko dilli main 7 main se 7 siten milengi
 Today's attack on @ arvindkejriwalis an indicator of levels to which BJP can stoop! They did the same thing before 2015 Delhi elections
 In 2015, AAP won 67 / 70 seats and these attacks by BJP will ensure that AAP gets 7 / 7 seats in Delhi! # bjpscaredofkejriwal— Atishi (@atishiaap)may 4, 2019bijepi pravaktaa syed jafar islam ne kaha, 'hamaari party kaa koi bhi kaaryakarta yaa netaa is tarah kii chizon se dur rahata he, lekin pradesh kii janata traahi-traahi kar rahi he, kyonki kejariwal ne jitne vaayade kiye gaye the wo puure nahin kiye
 He further said that Kejriwal wants to get the sympathy of the people by slapping himself, but the era of 2013-2014 was different then, but if they did it to get sympathy again, the public would understand directly
 'congress pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh ne kaha, 'loktantr main vichaardhaar par asamat ho sakate hai lekin kisi par haath nahin chalaa sakate hai

 Located on the ranchi-jamshedpur highway, red and yellow threads are wrapped around the trees surrounding this temple
 yahaan aane vaale shraddhalu apni manokamana kii purti ke liye ye dhaage baandhte hai
 This temple is famous for the rare four-handed idol of Durga, but local tourist guides add glamor to it by calling it Dhoni's temple
 cricketer mahendra singh dhoni apni kishoravastha ke dinon se hi yahaan aate rahe hai
 Temple priests and flower sellers are eagerly awaiting Dhoni's arrival before the one-day match in Ranchi on January 19
 dhoni bataa chuke hai ki devi durga kii krupa se hi ve jivan main itani oonchaaiyon tak pahunche hai
 It is difficult to understand how a person whose decision is so logic-based can be so religious that sometimes he will not even suffer from animal sacrifice
 yahi to dhoni kaa apana alag andaaj he
 Sachin gets up early in the morning to fulfill his passion of racing cars at high speed
 par dhoni itani jaldi nahin uthte
 They wear helmets on their heads, ride on their Hayabusa and go out on the streets of Ranchi or Chennai, and poor policemen try to chase them with their 100 cc bikes and run away with helplessness
 baad main dhoni or unke dost iskaa zikr karke khub hansate hai
 Although Indian fans have been hurt by the recent outburst at the hands of England in the home Test series, Dhoni is much more saddened by the death of his German Shepherd dog Sam, which he wrote on Twitter
 unhone apane ritairement ke baad sena main jane kii ichha jaahir kii or leftinent-karnal kaa maanad pad bhi le liya, haalanki unhone sena ke vaarshik parade main hissaa lene ke prastaav ko manaa kar diya he
 He has also angered the government by not participating in the Padma Awards ceremony, he is said to have been busy in advertisements at that time
 dhoni ke kai rup hai
 a captain, who defends his team and his players and does not highlight the flaws of his players when the team loses, but gives the best playing player a chance to be praised
 ve 2015 ke vishwa cap main apana khitaab bachaane ke liye nai team taiyaar karne main ji-jaan se jute hai, saath hi ve team kii kamjor chhavi ko puri tarah badal dene kii bhi koshish kar rahe hai
 The white hair of Dhoni's temple has become a matter of discussion
 is bare main ve kehete hai, ''yah dimag par padane vaale bahut zyada dabaav or upar se shant rahakar use jajb karne kaa nateeja he
 "but Captain Dhoni's concerns are something else
 unhen bisisiai ke adhyaksh en
 Srinivas has full patronage
 yah sanyog hi he ki shrinivasana chennai super kings ke maalik hai or dhoni ipiel kii isi team ke captain hai
 Dhoni has managed to retain the captaincy even after the embarrassing defeats in England and Australia and then the Test series at the hands of England in his own country and the one-day series against Pakistan
 isse unhone sabit kar diya he ki unhen haath lagane kii takat kisi main nahin he
 Dhoni was the first World T20 champion to beat the champions for a big win, gave him a rare win in the ODI series in Australia, beating Sri Lanka for the first time in an ODI series on his own land, number one in the Test ranking Made the most and gave the country a World Cup gift after 28 years
 in sab uplabdhiyon ne unhen bhartiya cricket kii ek diggaj hasti bana diya he
 But at the same time, other stalwarts, who have contributed a lot to Dhoni's achievements, were gradually sidelined
 saurav ganguli, rahul dravid, ve
 V
 es
 When legendary players like Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag retired or were removed from the team, Dhoni's name was taken behind it
 is tarah ve na sirf diggaj hai balki diggajon ko thikaane lagane vaale ke rup main bhi dekhe jate hai
 Ganguly was dropped from the 2008 CB series in Australia, after which Bengal Cricket Association President Prasun Mukherjee openly questioned Dhoni's role
 sutron ke mutabik, lakshmana ne newjiland test siries main chune jane ke baavjood ritair hone kii apni yojana kii ghoshnaa kar di thi kyonki sutron ke anusaar, dhoni ne unhen aisi ghoshnaa karne ko baadhya kiya tha
 It is said that Dhoni had placed a condition in front of him to announce his plans to retire before the series, otherwise he will be removed from the team
 lakshmana ne yah kahkar maamle ko or bhi sandigdh bana diya ki ve phone par dhoni se baat nahin kar sake
 That very week, he invited members of Team India to his house for dinner and Dhoni was not named in the guest list
 sachin tendulkar ne bhi achaanak vanade antarrashtriya maichon se ritair hone kii ghoshnaa kar di, jabaki kuch pal baad hi pakistan ke khilaaf siries ke liye team kaa chunaav hone ja rahaa tha
 He said in his statement that the time has come to prepare the future team
 dilli main tisare vanade match ke dauraan pakistan ke mahaan cricketer hanif mohammad ne tendulkar ke ritair hone ke samay par sawaal uthaaya
 He believed that there was definitely something behind it
 sahvaag or dhoni ke bich daraar kii baat kai baar saamne aa chuki he or captain ne is salaami ballebaaj ko team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaane main hichak nahin dikhaai he
 Apart from being a strong pillar of Dhonitim India swallowing the vice-captains, there is another similarity between Laxman, Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Gautam Gambhir
 ve sabhi dhoni kii captaini ke tahat up-captain rah chuke hai or unhone ipiel main behtareen captaini kii misaal pesh karte hue dhoni kii captaini ko kadi chunauti bhi de daali he
 Now it is just a coincidence or some well-thought-out move that all of them have been left out of the team in a big way
 dhoni kii captaini ke tahat taiyaar hue sabhi sambhavit captainon main se sirf gambhir hi khel ke sabhi formet main apni jagah banaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Laxman was forced to retire
 yuvaraj kaa test kariyar puri tarah khatm ho chukaa he or vanade maichon main bhi kaaphi had tak unka kariyar daanv par he
 Raina's place in the team has been under repeated questions and the chances of him getting back in the Test at the moment are slim
sehwag test kii captaini ke sabase bade daavedaar sahvaag—jaisaa chayan samiti se baahar ho chuke mohinder amarnath ne disambar main ujagar kiya tha—england ke khilaaf shuru hone vaale pehle teen vanade maichon se baahar ho chuke hai
 Under the former selection committee, Dhoni's most powerful rival Gautam Gambhir has been struggling to prove his place in the team
 australia se test siries haarane or chayankartaaon kii ore se pehali baar captaini badale jane ke maamle par vichaar kiye jane ke turant baad dhoni ne farvari-march 2012 ke dauraan australia ke vanade daure main tendulkar, sahvaag or gambhir ko baari-baari se khilaae jane kaa apana mashhoor prayog shuru kiya tha
 a few days later, in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, Sehwag was dropped and Gambhir's vice-captaincy was taken away
 achaanak viraat kohli ko up-captaini kaa bhaar de diya gaya
 Sources say, it was a well-thought-out move that there should be no threat to Dhoni's captaincy as Kohli was too young to captain at that time
 ek-vyakti kii chayan samititeam ke sutron kaa kahana he ki dhoni van-main chayan samiti hai
 This is proved by an example of how the half-hearted R
 during the 2011 series against England
 pi
 Singh was included in the Test team in the middle of the tour or how Piyush Chawla has been coming and going in the team despite not doing anything special or how Ravindra Jadeja suddenly finds a place in all formats
 purv spinner maninder singh kehete hai, ''samasya yah he ki dhoni ne kabhi-kabhaar hi gharelu cricket kheli he or ve khiladinnon ko thik se nahin jaanate hai
 So they keep giving few players a chance again and again
 ” andruni logon kaa kahana he ki dhoni kii asli takat shrinivasana hai, jo unhen puraa samarthan dete hai
 Such support is not new in Indian cricket
 ganguli or jagmohan daalamia ke bich bhi isi tarah captain or mukhya prashaasak kaa majboot rishta tha
 Ganguly benefited from this
 lekin sitambar, 2014 ke baad kya hoga, jab shrinivasana bisisiai kii lagaam apane kisi uttaradhikari ko saunp denge? 2015 ke farvari-march main world cap hona he, kya us samay bhi shrinivasana or dhoni kii jodi team india kaa bhavishya tay karegi? kya dhoni kade sangharsh ke baad jite gaye cap ko bachaa paaenge? isaki sambhaavna kam hi he ki dhoni kii pariktha main koi bada mode aae

 railway kii koshish he ki is kaam main koi baadha na pade kyonki aane vaale dinon main joardaar sardi padegi or usase pehle kaam ko jitna ho sake puraa karnaa hoga
 During this time Northern Railway has worked with Konkan Railway Corporation Limited to train the people of the new companies involved in the construction of udhampur-srinagar-baramulla Rail Link (USBRL)

 uttar pradesh main bijepi ko do-tihaai bahumat ke baad siem chehre ko lekar ravivaar ko dilli main bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak hui
 The names of Venkaiah Naidu and Bhupendra Yadav have been approved as observers for UP
 iske alaava bijepi sansadeey dal kii baithak main faisla liya gaya he ki 16 march ko upi ke vidhayak dal kii baithak hogi
 The next CM of UP will also be announced on the same day
 bijepi kii parliamentry board ne amit shah ko adhikrut kiya he ki ve baaki sadasyon se baat karke mukhyamantri kaa naam tay karen
 It is believed that the final choice will be stamped only after the approval of PM Modi
 amit shah ne kii rajnath se mulakatis kadi main amit shah se aaj rajnath singh se unke awaas par mulaakaat kii
 What has emerged from Mukalat between Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh is yet to be revealed
 vaise rajnath singh ke naam bhi mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil hai
 Even before this, he has commanded the state
 kaddavar netaa ke saath-saath inaki chhavi-suthri he
 However, Rajnath Singh has not yet responded to this
 ye do naam hai siem ke res mensutron ke mutabik bijepi main philhal upi main siem chehre ke taur par do naamon par charchaa chal rahi he
 Among the names that are discussed, the first name is of the home minister of the country Rajnath Singh and the second name of the BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya
 rajnath singh: anbhavi netarajanath singh ke naam kii charchaa isliye bhi joro par he kyonki ravivaar ko amit shah or grahamantri ke bich mulaakaat hui thi
 Although the agenda of the meeting is not clear yet, it is being speculated that Shah had gone to know Rajnath Singh's side there
 bijepi upi main koi risk nahin lenaa chaahati isiilie soch samaj kar kadam uthaa rahi he
 This is the reason why the party wants to play bets in the name of Rajnath Singh
 kyonki rajnath singh party ke varisht or majhe hue rajaneta hai
 Apart from this, Rajnath Singh has also held the power of UP earlier
 sanbhali thi kalyaan kii gaddiapako yaad dilaa den ki upi main bijepi ke pehle mukhyamantri kalyaan singh kii gaddi rajnath singh ne hi sanbhali thi
 However, Ram Prakash Gupta also had a 351-day tenure between Kalyan and Rajnath Singh
 lekin, gupt se satta sanbhal nahin rahi thi jis vajah se party ne 28 oktober 2000 ko pradesh kii bagdor rajnath singh ke haathon main saunpi
 Clearly, it is beyond the control of a state as big as UP
 ho saktaa he ki yahi vajah ho ki bijepi ek baar phir apane puraane netaa par daanv khelnaa chaah rahi ho
 Better governance: Rajnath Singh, like Kalyan Singh, kept the reins of power under his chief minister
 iske saath hi unhone pradesh ke kisaanon ke liye kisaan credit card jaisi skim bhi shuru kii jiske liye unki kaaphi tarif hui
 Modi's journey will be flawless, no one has the same stature as Narendra Modi, who was present in the BJP
 lekin, bijepi main number do ke taur par log rajnath singh ko hi dekhte hai
 If Rajnath Singh takes over the power of UP, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have no one else in the party as Arun Jaitley is considered to be one of the most powerful ministers after Rajnath
 keshav prasad maury: sanghathan kii shaktiupi ke agle siem ke taur par duusare number charchaa keshav prasad maury kii he
 If the BJP fought this election in UP under the leadership of Keshav Prasad Maurya, then the credit for this victory also goes to him
 aise main bijepi unhen siem banaakar yah sandesh bhi de sakati he ki 'jo karegaa wo paaegaa'
 Keshav has been associated with the Sangh for a long time
 keshav prasad maury rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se bachapan se hi jud gaye the
 Keshav was associated with the Sangh as a child volunteer
 baad main keshav prasad ne vishwa hindu parishad or bajrang dal ke liye bhi kaam kiya he
 Keshav Prasad worked for the Vishwa Hindu Parishad for 12 years, he was considered special to VHP leader Ashok Singhal
 apane bhaashanon ke chalate ayodhya or gau raksha andolan ke vakt keshav ko jail bhi ho chuki he
 Keshav has also sold tea
 Let us tell you that Keshav Prasad Maurya has been born in a farmer house in Kaushambi district
 unhone apana bachapan garibi main bitaayaa he
 Like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Keshav Prasad Maurya has also sold tea and distributed newspapers to help his family
 yah baat keshav ko modi kii chhavi ke bahut paas le jaati he
 Amit Shah's Khasakeshava Prasad Maurya is considered to be special of Amit Shah
 yahi vajah he ki upi ke kai varisht netaaon kii maujuudagi ke baavjood party kii bagdor unke haathon main ai
 Let us tell you that Keshav Prasad Maurya was elected MLA from Shirathu assembly seat in Allahabad in 2012 assembly elections
 2014 main ve phulpur loksabhaa seat se saansad chune gaye
 In April 2016, Keshav Prasad Maurya was entrusted with the power of the UP BJP, winning the 2017 assembly elections
 pichde varg ko sandeshbijapi upi kii satta keshav ke haathon main dekar rajya ke pichde varg ko saadhane kii koshish bhi kar sakati he
 The OBC vote has been the core vote of the SP, with the latest election results concluding that the BJP has succeeded in making a dent in this vote bank to some extent
 bijepi keshav ko siem bana is varg ko saaf sandesh de sakati he ki bijepi raaj main bhi unka bhavishya surakshit or ujjwal he
 Apart from these two faces, these names are also discussed

 According to the study of Parliamentary Business
com, a website focused on the functioning of Parliament and mps, all the leaders were seen to be very active outside Parliament and Parliament, but the most important responsibility of the MP proved to be a matter of questioning
 kul 31 saansad aise hai jinhone ek bhi sawaal poochna gavaara nahin samajha
 The website 'parliamentary Business
com' was launched by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan
 website ne loksabhaa ke bajet satr sahit puure paanch saal ke sabhi satron kaa gaharaai se vishleshan kar kai rochak jaankariyaan pesh kii hai
 If we analyze the functioning and wasted time in the Lok Sabha, the productivity of the 16th Lok Sabha was 87 percent overall
 sabase adhik kaam 2016 ke bajet satr main or sabase kam kaam isi varsh hue sheetakaaleen satr main hua
 While 126 percent work was done in the budget session, only 17 percent work was done in the winter session
 loksabhaa main kul milakar 1659:47 ghante hi kaam hua or taqariban 500 se zyada ghante kaa samay barbaad hua
 The reason for wasted Lok Sabha time is the constant disruption
 16 veen loksabhaa ke paanch saalon main kul 63,443 baar vyavdhaan hua
 Apart from this, 609 mps have come to the Well and 171 times have been out
 baar baar ke vyavadhaanon ke kaaran 313 baar loksabhaa ko sthagit karnaa padaa
 Interestingly, due to continuous disruption, mps are less in the Lok Sabha and as a result, they have to ring a bell to complete the quorum 191 times
 bihar main in dinon photo politics kaa daur garmaya hua he
 The characters are being questioned by showing each other's picture
 isi kadi main bihar ke up-mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa naam jud gaya he
 Sushil Modi has made a first-hand statement regarding former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav's selfie controversy
 susheel modi se jab is prakaran ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki mahila ke saath tejasvi kii tasviir keval selfi nahin, balki ek antarang photo he
 Modi said that such pictures should be avoided in public life
 bhale hi wo ise selfi qaraar de rahe hai, lekin ye selfi antarangta ko darsha rahi he
 Avoid intimacy in stunning public life and tell someone if they have love or intimacy
 jab koi fain kisi ke saath selfi khinchataa hai to is tarah najadik aakar khinchataa he kya?unhone kaha ki is tarah kii tasveeron se samaaj main galat massej jaataa he
 He said that we also take selfies with our fans and women every day in our public life, but such intimacy is nowhere to be seen
 bataa den ki tejasvi yadav ne us photo par kaha tha ki jab wo ipel khelaa karte the tabaki tasviir he
 In IPL match parties, women fans take selfie photos with players

 The railway administration has now become skeptical on receiving complaints of misuse of quota being given to senior citizens in trains
 varisht nagarikon ke cote ke naam par durupyog ko rokane ke liye nayaa niyam lagu hoga
 Senior citizens will now have to provide proof of age during ticket booking
 pramaan dikhaane par hi tikat kaa aarakshan kiya jayega
 If a passenger shows wrong proof then his reserved berth will be canceled
 gauratlab he ki railway main abhi tak kisi bhi rail aarakshan centre yaa online tikat kii kharid par koi bhi aayu praaanpatr nahin dena padataa tha
 Lower berths for senior citizens were also confirmed
 iske saath hi yatra main purushon ko 60 varsh se adhik hone par 40 pratishat or mahilaon ko 58 varsh se upar hone par 50 pratishat kii kiraaye main chhot milti he
 The comments yatra ke dauraan varisht nagarikon ko apana aayu praaanpatr dikhaanaa hota tha
 In such a situation, while taking reservation, senior citizens used to take advantage of the quota by showing their age incorrectly
 yatra ke dauraan agar titii pakad letaa tha to yatri jurmaana dekar batch jate the
 Not only this, in the event of not showing the age certificate, the differential fair was collected from the passengers and they were given seats, causing loss of railway revenue and the seat was not available to the needy
 is cote main yatriyon ke dwaara durupyog hone kii shikaayat milane par railway board ne ab niyam kade kar die hai
 According to the new rules of Railway Board, now tickets can be booked as before and an age certificate will have to be given during the journey itself
 yadi yatri aayu praaanpatr na de sakaa to use ab betikat mana jayega
 Railways will now collect fine without such tickets from such passengers

 The CBI filed a charge sheet against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler and jailed arms dealer Abhishek Verma
 varsh 2009 main tatkaaleen grih rajyamantri ajay maakan ke letterhed kaa kathith rup se farjivada karne ke liye unpar aaropapatr daayar kiya gaya he
 The agency has not named Tytler as an accused in the FIR but it has included his name in the charge sheet filed in the CBI court alleging that Verma was "forged" in connivance with the Congress leader
 tippaniyan a CBI official familiar with the investigation said, "the fraudulent letter was given to a telecom company in China intended to falsely assure them that their visa period in India would be extended
" verma ne patr dikhaakar company se kathith rup se das lakh dollar kii maang kii lekin dhan kaa len-dein nahin hua
 On the complaint of Maken, the CBI had registered a case against Verma last year under Section 469 of the IPC relating to fraud done for the purpose of tarnishing the image
 titalar ne apane khilaaf aaropon se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘yah sab bakawaas he
 i have come to know about it
 isamen koi sachai nahin he
 "asked if he was actively involved in the fraud, Tytler said," How? i do not know what they are saying
 yah shikaayat ajay maakan ne kii he? yah chunaav kaa vakt he
 He said that the agency has also registered a case of violation of the Information Technology Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act
 agency ne praathmiki main titalar kaa naam aaropee ke taur par nahin rakhaa he lekin sibiai kii adaalat main daayar aaropapatr main isane unka naam shaamil kiya he or aarope lagaaya he ki congress netaa ke saath verma ‘‘kii mileebhagat se farjivada’’ kiya gaya
 The comments jaanch se parichit sibiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘farjivada kiye gaye patr ko china kii ek doorsanchaar company ko diya gaya jiskaa uddeshy unhen galat tareeke se aashwast karnaa tha ki bharat main unki vija avadhi bad jaaegi
 Verma showed the letter and allegedly demanded a million dollars from the company but the money was not transacted
 ’ maakan kii shikaayat par sibiai ne verma ke khilaaf pichley varsh bhadansan kii dhara 469 ke tahat maamla darj kiya tha jo chhavi kharaab karne ke uddeshy se kii gai dhokhadhadi se sambandhit he
 Tytler denied the allegations against him, saying, 'this is all nonsense
 mujhe is bare main pataa chalaa he
 There is no truth in it
 ’ yah poochne par ki farjivade main sakriy rup se unki sanliptata thi to titalar ne kaha, ‘kaise? mujhe nahin maaloom ki ve kya kah rahe hai
 Ajay Maken has made this complaint? It is election time
 ’ unhone kaha ki agency ne soochna praudyogiki adhinium or bhrashtachar nirodhak adhinium ke ulanghan kaa bhi maamla darj kiya he
 a CBI official familiar with the investigation said, "the fraudulent letter was given to a telecom company in China intended to falsely assure them that their visa period in India would be extended

 The negligence of doctors at the government hospital in Dadri, Greater Noida, has once exposed the government's functioning, where a patient who fell from the train and was injured for hours due to the absence of a doctor was suffering even for hours

 baad main noida ke jila aspataal pahunchate hi doctor ne yuvak ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 This shows that if the young man gets treatment in time, the young man may have survived

 The telecom minister said his statement that there was no loss to the state exchequer was unnecessarily touted and was not presented in the correct context
 sibbal ne daawa kiya ki unhone yah kabhi nahin kaha tha ki yadi spectrum kii boli lagaai jaati to sarkaar ko rajasav nahin miltaa
 Taking part in the discussion, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley rejected the government's claim of increasing telecom density, saying that increasing telecom density does not mean harm to the exchequer
 unhone kaha ki kuch logon ne doorsanchaar kshetra kii safalataa ko ghotaale main tabdeel kar diya he

 unhone kaha ki is mamale main prashasan, company jagat, media, mantriyon, rajanetaaon ke bare main bhi sawaal uthe the
 Therefore, this step was necessary to maintain the credibility of the entire system

 The Meteorological Department on Sunday said that due to the low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, the southwest monsoon is likely to increase further and it is expected to turn into a severe cyclonic storm by last night
 mausam vibhaag ne kaha ki kerala main 30 - 31 may tak barish hone kii sambhaavna he or iske saath hi desh main monsoon dastak de degaa
 Earlier this week, m Rajeevan, Secretary in the Ministry of Earth Sciences, said that there are favorable conditions for the arrival of monsoon by 30 May

 The accident occurred in Mumbai amid problems of rain and waterlogging
 haadase ke vakt kai log nichali manzil par so rahe the
 19 people were killed in this accident, while 34 people were injured
 17veen loksabhaa ke liye 17 may ko aakhri daur kaa chunaav prachaar khatm hua or usee din pradhanmantri narendra modi ne media se mukhaatib hokar aatmavishvaas ke saath phir se sarkaar main vaapasi kaa daawa kar diya
 On May 19, when all the exit polls came out, Prime Minister Modi's confidence was seen to reflect a strong truth
 desh ke sabase bharosemand agsit pole ajtak or exis maai india ke pole main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv ko dur-dur tak koi chunauti nahin dikh rahi he
 The bjp-led NDA is projected to get 339 to 365 seats out of 543 seats, while the BJP itself can get 293 to 316 seats
 agar ye anumaan sachai main badal gaye to 21veen sadi main satta kii badalati raajnneeti kaa pradhanmantri narendra modi hi ek baar phir sabase bada cheharaa honge
 But there are some estimates of exit polls that can not only prevent BJP from creating history, but also bring the Congress graph to the lowest level
 78 siton par kadi takkaregjit pole ke anumaanon main yah tathy saamne aayaa he ki deshbhar kii 78 loksabhaa siton par muqabla kadaa rahane vaala he
 However, BJP or its allies are ahead in most of these seats
 agsit pole ke mutabik, taff fite vaali siton main 37 par endie (33 bijepi, 4 gathbandhan dal) aage chal rahaa he, jabaki 17 siton par upie kaa padala baari he
 Of these, the Congress' allies are leading in 4 seats, while on 13 the Congress itself is leading
 in donon pramukh dalon ke alaava shesh siton par trinmul congress, tidipi, wiesar, bijedy, basapa or sipiiem jaise dalon ke pratyaashee sabase popular najar aa rahe hai
 The difference between just 3 percent of the vote is that the difference of just 3 percent of the vote is visible between the winning candidate in all these 78 seats and the second-ranked candidate
 aise main yah kam antar kisi bhi party ke liye nirnaayak sabit ho saktaa he, jiskaa nateezon par bada asar dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 First picture - If the BJP is looking ahead in the 33 seats, if it loses on all of them, then the bjp's figure will fall to 285 seats
 agar aisa bhi hota he to bijepi aasaani se purna bahumat tak pahunch jaaegi
 The 13 seats in which Congress is leading in a tough contest, if it wins, the graph of the Congress will increase slightly, but if the Congress loses then its number will reach 38, which will be below the number 44 in 2014
 yani congress apane itihaas ke sabase nichle str par pahunch jaaegi
 Second picture: If BJP manages to win all these 33 seats too, it will create history and will cross the figure of 300 on its own and reach 318 seats
 1984 ke baad yah pehali baar hoga jab koi party apane dam par 300 ke paar jaaegi
 If these recent contesting seats of up-bengal are seen in terms of a state like UP and Bengal, then there is a tuff fight on 24 seats
 agsit pole anumaanon ke mutabik, upi main jahaan bijepi or mahagathbandhan ke bich muqabla he to vahiin bengal main bijepi or tiemasi ke bich taff fite rahane vaali he
 The Mahagathbandhan and BJP are leading in seven seats each in UP
 dilachasp baat ye he ki agar mahagathbandhan in saat siton ko bhi kho detaa he to uski jeet single number tak simat jaaegi or bijepi apane 73+ ke daawey par khari utar jaaegi
 At the same time, TMC was ahead of BJP in five seats in Bengal
 in siton par agar tiemasi haar jaati he to bijepi kii bengal main jabardast entry hogi
 However, these are estimates of all exit polls
 anumaan asal nateezon main kitne tabdeel hote hai, yah tasviir 23 may ko saaf ho jaaegi, lekin agsit pole se jo ye paristhiti banakar ubhari he wo behad dilachasp najar aa rahi he
 Exit Poll of every seat in the country, see: whose victory predictions from your region desh main zyaadaatar logon ko lagata he ki ek baar phirtim india cricket world cap par kabjajamaayegi
 According to a survey, 74 percent people are hopeful of India's victory

 Indians are the second big contenders for Australia title
 survey main shaamil 55 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki agar final australia or bharat ke bich hota he to muqabla behad romaanchak hoga
 At the same time, 44 percent people feel that Virat Kohli can become the highest run-scorer in this World Cup
 haalanki gendbaaji ko lekar logon ne chintaa jataai he

 saf ne bataaya ki nepotism maamle par had se zyada baatcheet ho chuki he, isliye nepotism main unka bilkul bhi vishwaas nahin he or wo kangana ranot ke khyaal se ittefaq rakhte hai or isi vajah se massej par unhone kangana se baat kii or maafee maangi
 Kangana also understood his point
 saf kaa maananaa he ki wo aise hai nahin jaisaa sabko laga, or yahi vajah he jo unhone is vishay par kangana se baat kii, saf kaa ye bhi kahana he ki karan johar or kangana ke bich jo bhi vivaad he wo unka nijee maamla he, lekin unhen is baat kaa afsos he ki wo is majaak kaa hissaa bane
 All this was already in the script, apart from talking to Kangana on the message, Saif has not talked to Naran Karan Johar and Varun Dhawan
 anjaane main kiye gaye majaak se saf aahat hai
 Saif Ali Khansaif, who will be seen in this actor's son's debut film, also believes that nepotism is a very big topic that must be discussed
 shahrukh khan, amitabh bachchan or akshay kumaar jaise sitaron kii tarif bhi kii
 He was able to make his own place in the film industry on his own
 saf ne ye mana ki shuruaati daur main unhen jarur kaam jaldi mila sharmila tagore ke bete kii haisiyat kii badaulat, lekin ye bhi kaha agar unamem tallent nahin hota to wo itane saal film industry main tik nahin pate
 Know what the whole case was, Johar, Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan made fun of Kangana on the stage of IIFA Award in New York
 is aword function ko karan johar or saf host kar rahe the or tabhi ek maukey par jab varun dhawan stage par best actor comic role kaa aword lene ki liye pahunche tabhi saf ali khan ne kaha nepotism yani bhai bhatija kii baat chhedate hue kaha, 'aaj tum jo bhi ho sirf apane pita kii vajah se ho'
 Varun Dhawan responded to Saif and whatever you are is because of his mother Sharmila Tagore
 ' baat yaheen nahin thami, phir karan johar ne kaha, 'main is industry main apane pita kii badaulat hum' or phir teenon ne jor se kaha 'nepotism rox'
 Saif and Varun sang a song from Karan Johar's film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and said, "bole Banguri Bole Kangna", on which Karan Johar said to Tapak "kangna is neither spoken nor good
" ' lekin ab saf ali khan ne maafee maang lee he or varun dhawan ne twit ke jariye maafee maangi
 So hopefully this dispute will stop now

 But only such Ashkas could write
 isliye ki unamem punjab or mumbai, khet-khalihaan or shahar ek saath jinda the
 He was also a businessman and a writer

 He was of Punjab, but how many
 
 
 
 Like his writing, his life also extends from here to there
 
 
 
 Random despite being a bit time consuming
 upendranath ashk kaa janm punjab ke jalandhar main 14 disambar, 1910 ko ek madhyamvargeey brahman parivaar main hua tha
 He was the second of 6 brothers
 pita pandit madhoram stesan master the
 At that time, the salary of the station master was not much
 par unke pita ne apni aay kaa asar apane bacchon kii padhai par nahin padane diya
 Upendranath Ashk did his matriculation from Jalandhar and BA from DAV College
 punjab ke duusare bacchon kii tarah hi bachapan se hi ashk bhi adhyaaapak, lekhak, sampadak, vaktaa, vakil, abhinayta, diarector banane or rangamanch tathaa film main jane ke sapane dekha karte the
 Upendranath Ashk became a teacher in his own school after passing BA, but left it in 1933
 kuch samay baad jivicoparjan hetu vah saptahik patr 'bhuuchaal' se jud gaye
 Edited it usee dauraan ek anya saptahik 'guru ghantal' ke liye prati saptaah ek rupye main ek kahani bhi likhakar di

 They were married by then, but the wife became ill before enjoying marital life
 lambii beemaari ke baad vah chal bases
 This was the era of independence movement
 baahar jitani halchal thi, ashk ke jivan main usase kam jhanjhaavat nahin the
 This period of turmoil also had an impact on his creative talent
 jaaliyanvaala baag jaisi ghatnaon ne unke bal man par gaharaa prabhaav daalaa tha
 But as a writer, he was under the influence of the progressive movement and his inclination towards transformative value-consciousness was the result of that movement
 unki kahaniyaan maanviya niyati ke prashnon, jivan kii vidambnaaon, madhyavargeey manushya ke dainandin jivan kii gutthiyon ke chithran ke kaaran naagarik jivan ke har pahalu se sambhddha thim or saamaanya pathakon kii apni kahaniyaan lagatee thim
 Ali Sardar Jafri: The poet who had to go to jail after independence
 After 1936, the very fertile era of Ashk's writer personality began
 1941 main unhone duusari shaadi kar lee
 The same year also joined 'all India Radio'
 par use bhi chhod diya
 In December 1945, he was invited to the film industry to Mumbai for writing in films
 1947-1948 main ashk ji nirantar aswasth rahe
 But this was the golden period of his literary creation
 1948 se 1953 tak ashk danpati ke jivan main sangharsh bana rahaa
 But it was during these days that Upendranath Ashk, the distinguished narrator of Premchandottar Katha literature, was born
 hindi- urdu ke is bahuvidhaavaadi rachanaakaar ne yakshma ke changul se nikalakar mumbai se elahabaad kii sharan le lee
 Ashk arranged 'neelabh publishing house' in Allahabad
 yaheen unhone kahani, upanyaas, niabandh, lekh, sansmaran, aalochana, naatak, ekanki, kavita aadi likhe
 Earlier he was writing in Urdu
 urdu main 'nav-ratna' or 'aurat kii fitarat' unke do kahani sangrah prakashit ho chuke the, par munshi premchand kii salaah par 'ashk' ne hindi main likhnaa shuru kar diya
 His second story collection 'aurat Ki Fitrat' published in 1933 was written by Munshi Premchand
 hindi ke pehle sangrah 'judaai kii shaam kaa geet' jab 1933 main chapa, to uski adhikansh kahaniyaan urdu main pehle hi chap chuki thim
 Ashk ji himself also believed that his works before 1936 were average
 par 1936 ke baad ashk apane shabaab par aa gaye
 In this period, his critical treatise 'A new stream of Urdu poetry', historical drama 'jai Parasay', Ekanki, 'papi', 'whore', 'defender of authority', 'welcome to Lakshmi', 'leech', 'paheli' And 'aap Ka Saathkar' social drama, 'jhalak of heaven', all the stories in the story collection 'pinjra', some stories in 'chhinte' and all the poems of the poetry collection 'prat Pradeep' were written within two-and-a-half years
 naatak 'alag alag raste' bhi isi daur main aayaa
 Book excerpt - Why i am Hindu: Hindu and Hinduism in Shashi Tharoor's words, be it a novel called 'girthi wall' and 'hot ash' or the drama 'chhath Son', 'anjodidi' and 'kaid' Ashk made his mark in every field Left
 unki 'bhavar', 'charvaahe', 'chilman', 'tauliye' or 'sukhi daali' jaisi rachanaaen ekanki kala kaa ucch udhaaharan hai
 Behind these creations is Ashk ji's creative ability, a keen eye, a grasp of language, an understanding of society and sensationalism full of sensibilities
 elahabaad kii do ghatnaon kaa ullekh ise samajhane ke liye kaaphi he
 They are counted in the big events of the literary world
 elahabaad kii baat he
 Once a literary student asked Upendranath Ashk to sign autofahi, Ashk ji who had become a publisher along with the author, had adopted marketing methods
 unhone autograph dete hue likhaa, 'pustaken kharid kar padho- ashk'
 It is said that Dharamvir Bharti was also sitting there
 jab chaatra ne unase autograph dene ke liye kaha, to unhone autograph ke saath likhaa- pustak kharidne kaa pataa- nilabh prakaashan, khusro baag, elahabaad
 This address was from the publication institute of Upendranath Ashk
 fahmida riyaaz: wo shaayara, jise paak main bharat kaa agent kaha gayadusri ghatana isse kuch alag thi, par thi mjedaar
 Ashk ji opened groceries in order to strengthen the economic conditions
 tab kaa media raajnneeti ke saath-saath saahitiyik akhaadebaaji main bhi khub ras letaa tha
 So it was reported that Ashk has lost his fascination with writing and publishing and is selling groceries

 Friends called, and the case was compounded by the plight of the litterateur
 andolan kii taiyaari bhi ho gai or sarkari sahaayta kii maang shuru hoti usase pehle hi ashk ji ne khud hi sthiti spasht kar di
 Upendranath Ashk literature, theater, cinema, urdu-hindi were all
 saal 1965 main unhen sangeet naatak academy puraskaar or 1972 main 'soviet land nehru puraskaar' se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 He died on January 19, 1996, but before that he had created so much that even today he is remembered

 rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav hameshaa bihar main alag-alag tarah kii bhaawanaaon ko prerit karte rahe hai
 His name thrives in love among his supporters, causing panic among the opponents and for some leaders they are an opportunity to capitalize on the tremendous influence of Pappu
 jab patna hycourt ne vidhayak ajit sarkaar kii hatya ke maamle main unhen bari kar diya to 48 varshiya pappu yadav 22 may ko jor-shor ke saath beur jail se baahar aa gaye, jahaan vah 2008 main doshi tehraae jane ke baad se hi umr kaid kii sajaa kaat rahe the

 Madhavi Sarkar, the wife of slain MLA Ajit Sarkar, said she would appeal against this release to the Supreme Court, but political friends of Bihar, apart from Pappu Yadav's friends and enemies, remained completely silent on her release
 pappu ne bhi apane rajnatik pattey nahin khole hai, haalanki unhone yah bataaya ki unki ranneeti 'yuvaaon ko jagaane' kii hogi

 jediu kii ek tacover lobby ranneetik tareeke se purniya se pappu yadav ko samarthan dene ke paksh main he
 According to him, Pappu Yadav should not hesitate to join the party too, as he is now acquitted from Patna High Court
 jediu ke ek netaa kehete hai, 'purniya main yadi udai singh se koi muqabla karne main sakasham he to vah pappu yadav hi ho sakate hai
 It is only by the relationship between BJP and JDU that their behavior towards Pappu Yadav will be determined
 vaise to pappu kii najdiki congress se he, kyonki unki patni or saharsa kii purv saansad ranjita ranjan congress main hai, lekin ab congress khud hi bihar main nitish par dore daal rahi he, jisaki andekhi pappu yadav nahin kar sakate

 Police said the accused woman's name is Praveen and she is from Mehtabgarh locality of Kapurthala
 jaankaree ke mutabik, kesaribagh ke sharma colony main rahane vaale sukhdev singh or unki patni ko kuch samay se bacchee kaa vyavhaar thik nahin lag rahaa tha

 The police have captured the video filmed in Sukhdev Singh's mobile

 1984 dange se judaa bayaan - ‘jab koi bada ped girtaa he to dharti hilti he
 After the death of Indira Gandhi in 1984, there was a statement of Rajiv Gandhi, in which he said, "when a big tree falls, the earth shakes
 ’ rajeev gandhi ke is bayaan ko 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon se jodakar dekha jaataa rahaa
 He is believed to be responsible for the deaths of thousands of Sikhs

 The most controversial issue related to Rajiv Gandhi was the Kirkir Shahbano case that took place when the court overturned the verdict in the Shah Bano case
 rajeev ne muslim vot bank ko khush karne ke liye court kaa faisla palat diya tha
 Actually, a lawyer from Indore divorced his wife Shah Bano after 43 years
 paanch bacchon samet ghar se baahar nikaal diya
 Shah Bano asked her husband for alimony every month
 hoicourt ne shah bano ke haq main faisla sunaaya
 But Shah Bano's husband challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court
 muslim purushon ko khush karne ke liye rajeev ne 1986 main muslim mahila vidheyak pesh kar diya jo aage chalakar kanoon ban gaya
 According to this law, after getting divorce, Muslim woman will get alimony for only three months
 yah kanoon rajeev gandhi ke kaarykaal ke liye sabase badi afat bana

 According to one statement, there is a wave of joy in North Korea from this test that their mission to become nuclear power was completed
 kaaphi ghaatak he yah missilamisile test ke bare main news agency api ne rocket export se baat kii
 According to the report, Hwasong-15 appears larger than the Hwasong-14 tested in July
 vahiin photose jari hone ke baad california ke centre for nonprolifaration studies ke research maaikel diutsman ne twit karte hue kaha tha ki yah kaaphi badi missile he
 Very few countries have the capability to make such missiles

 According to North Korea, a special domestic electric launcher was used for the Hwasong-15 missile

 Given the international pressure, this is good news for North Korea
 domestic elector launture gaadi tiel se Hwasong-15 missile ko kahin bhi le janaa aasaan he or is vajah se ise launch se pehle tabah karnaa or bhi mushkil ho jayega
 North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is capable of carrying large super heavy nuclear bombs
 isse america tak nishaanaa saadhaa ja saktaa he
 The tip of this missile is also very large, which is bolstering this claim
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki missile jitani baari hogi, uski range utani kam hoti jaati he
 According to the missile expert Michael Ileman, if the claim is that the Hwasong-15 is equipped with 13,000 km of firepower, then its load should be equal to 150 kg
 yah north korea ke kisi bhi newclear bam se kam vajan he
 To reach the US West Coast, North Korea will have to keep the weight of the missile below 500 kg
 aise main agar uttar korea america tak apni pahunch bananaa chahta he to use apane newclear bam kaa vajan kam se kam 350 kilo se kam rakhana hoga

 tawayph, jinhen lekar samaaj main aam dhaaran he ki wo mahaj naach gaakar manoranjan karne vaali ek mahilaayein hai
 However, the word "tawaif" also has other meanings
 lekin bahut se log us bare main nahin jaanate
 And the popular perception about the tawaifs has a cinema behind it
 manjari chaturvedi kaa kahana he, "aap mujhetvayfakahakar pukaariye, main bura nahin maanuungi
 Very few people know about this aspect of history
 " chaturvedi maanati hai ki vah tawaayphon kii kahani duniya ko sunaane main kareeb 20 saal let hai
 Let me tell you that Manjari is a Kathak dancer and is trying to break the concepts related to Tawaifs through her show
 unke shoj main mahilaon kii shandaar kahaniyon ko saajha kiya jaataa he
 In this episode, Manjari will perform in a show under The Curtucene Project at the NCPA Tata Theater in Mumbai on Thursday
 is dauraan 18 se 20veen shatabdi kii mahila parforgers kii kahaniyon ko prastut karengi
 The event will begin at 7 pm
 manjari, lakhanu shahar main pali-badi hai or unhone uttari rajyon main kathak siikhaa
 She then moved to Chennai to learn acting
 vah 16 saal kii umr se hi parform kar rahi hai
 It was from here that he moved towards the art of being "tawaif"
 tawaayphen, jo kabhi rajasi mehphilon kii dancer hone se kahin zyada hua karti thim
 In a conversation Manjari said, "we have not given respect to female performers as much as male performers
 or yadi purush or mahila donon parforgers hai to kyon purush star hai or mahilaayein mahaj naachne vaali?" manjari aarope lagaati hai ki sosayadi ne kisi bhi aatmanirbhar mahila par najar daali or use mashhoor karne ke liye uski tulana "veshya" se kar di
 According to Bollywood image of spoiled tawaifs, the same thing also came up in Bollywood, which had a mindset about the tawaifs
 wo hameshaa se ek bebas mahila ke taur par dikhaai jaati rahi hai
 Tawaif, the term was also used in dialogues to abuse someone
 haalanki sadiyon tak pehle tawaayphen, manoranjan kaa sarvshereshth saadhan hua karti thim or aam logon ke liye nishedh thim
 They used to be royal, who knew fine art of entertainment and who were proficient in Parsi language
 chaturvedi kahati hai, "ye mahilaayein shuruaati bhartiya cinema kii buniyaad rahi hai or mujre kii kala ke bahut chip varjan ke jariye aaj bhi sabase khubasurat mahilaon ko dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he

 ladki kaa kasoor sirf ye tha ki usne ilaake ke hi teen dabang yuvakon dwaara kii ja rahi chhedhkhani kaa virodh kiya tha
 The condition of 80 percent scorched girl remains critical

 The victim is swinging between life and death in the Emergency at the District Hospital of Moradabad
 peedit ladki sanbhal ke thana baniyather ke mohammadpur kasim kii rahane vaali he
 The matter was settled after protests and complaints of molestation, but on Sunday, the same three youths again molested them, this time making the girl expensive to protest
 peedit ladki kii maa ne bataaya ki unki beti daravaaje par khadi thi
 When the accused gave voice to the girl, she moved forward, on which the accused dragged her abusively and put kerosene and set it on fire

 aap soch rahe honge doctoron kaflite letkaraane se kya conection he to ham aapako puraa maamla bataate hai
 On March 8, an airline employee phoned the government-appointed doctor at the IGI Airport and asked him to check the passengers on the flight from Dubai, and the doctor felt anguished due to poor sleep
 doctor ne no objection certificate faad diya or karmchaaree ko kaha ki yatri ek ghanta enosi milane kaa intjaar kare yaa phir wo unase maafee maange
 At India Gandhi International Airport, such cases are constantly increasing when doctors delay in checking the swine flu of passengers arriving from international flights, which messes up the flight schedule
 hamaare sahyogi akhbaar 'mail today' ke paas uplabdh aankadon ke mutabik, airport swasthya sanghathan (APHO) ke doctoron kii vajah ausatan har 10 din main ek flite let ho rahi he
 While these doctors are delayed by half an hour every day
 yatri doctoron kii vajah se chah-chah ghante tak der hone kii shikaayat kar chuke hai
 The Civil Aviation Directorate has ordered all flights to be scanned before flying so that swine flu infection does not spread
 lekin swasthya mantralay kaa maananaa he ki airport par rojaanaa ek lakh yatriyon ko scan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 For this reason, doctors currently examine the passengers of 12 airlines from four countries where swine flu is the most affected
 ek airport adhikari ke mutabik, aise bahut saare maamle saamne aae hai, jab APHO ke doctoron kii vajah se flite let hui or yatriyon ko pratadna jhelni padi
 However, these doctors deny these allegations
 airport ke adhikari ke mutabik, 'pichley saal IGI airport se udi kenya airways kii ek flite ko isliye waapas aane ke liye kaha gaya kyonki APHO ke doctor usamen maujuud ek yatri kii jaanch karnaa bhul gaye the
 Kenya Airways told that the flight has reached Pakistan and now they cannot bring it back to Delhi
 ' The greatest decency among the leaders is seen only after the election results
 jo jeet jaataa he usamen to shaleenta aana swaabhaavik hi he, or jo haar gaya, uske paas to or koi vikalp hi nahin bachataa
 In the four states, and especially in Delhi, after the Congress sweep, Shahzade Rahul Gandhi, while showing this decency, announced to learn from Aam Aadmi Party
 sanjay jha or digvijay singh ne unke is aitihaasik elaan ke baad abhi tak twitor par isaki tarif main bade-bade pul nahin baandhe hai, jo phir se ek aitihaasik baat he
 But Rahul Baba's statement of learning from the Aam Aadmi Party is nothing more than an attempt to become noble and gracious
 blike and whitesmay rangeen tivi kaa he, lekin raajnneeti main safed dhan se zyada kaale dhan kaa yug aaj bhi shabaab par he
 The Aam Aadmi Party claims that they used only white money in campaigning, and they have deducted receipts for every small and big donation
 kya rahul gandhi or congress is baat kaa pran le sakate hai ki ve bhi chunaav main sirf safed dhan kaa istemaal karenge, or party ko milane vaale saare chande kaa hisaab website par daalenge?safai bahut jaruri hekejariwal dilli kii safai se pehle jhaadu se apni party main safai karne kii baat karte hai, bindaas hokar bolte hai ki chunaav se ek bhi din pehle yadi kisi ummidavaar ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa ek bhi subut milegaa to ummidavaar ko maidan se hataa lenge
 He also showed this by doing this at Rajouri Garden
 vahiin congress samet takreeban baaki sabhi partiyon ke liye sabase badi baat hoti he 'seat nikaalane vaale' ummidavaar kii pahchaan karnaa
 Considering the number of tainted people in the Lok Sabha and almost every Vidhan Sabha, do you think that Rahul Gandhi will only give tickets to clean candidates? Familyism: On this issue, Rahul Gandhi may not even learn a lot from Kejriwal
 aam aadmi party ke samvidhan main likhaa he ki ek hi parivaar ke do logon ko kabhi bhi chunavi tikat nahin milegaa
 Rahul Baba is still missing his late grandmother and late father to ask for votes
 to yadi rahul gandhi AAP se kuch sikhte hai to sabase pehle to unhen khud hi party chhodani hogi
 Will you leave? Basics is the biggest difference between the two parties
 abhi tak AAP kaa trek record dekhen to usamen logon kii samasyaon, desh kii unnati ityadi jaise 'boring' kism ke mudde chhaae hue hai, or shaayad sabko ye vishwaas bhi he ki yah party apane vaayadon par khari bhi utregi
 At the same time, is this atmosphere about the Congress sitting on a long list of scams ranging from 'brother-in-law' to the Congress? Aam Aadmi Aadmi Party's favorite slogan was 'congress's hand, along with common man'
 aapako aaj ke samay main aise kitne congressi saansad yaa vidhayak yaad aate hai jinamein se koi ek jhuggi main rahane vaali purv patrkaar ho, koi ek purv NSG commando ho, koi ek insurance agent ho yaa mahaz kuch hajaar ke bank balance vaala ek chaatr ho! yadi rahul gandhi ko kejariwal se vaaki main kuch siikhnaa he to dekhte hai ki agle chunaavon main wo kitne 'aam aadamiyon' ko tikat dete hai?jaruri nahin he ki kisi garib kii jhonpadi main raat guzaar kar aap raaton-raat unke maseehaa ban jaaenge, jaruri nahin ki raily main aasteen chadhaakar aap nae engri-yang main kaa khitaab le lenge, ye bhi jaruri nahin ki apni hi sarkaar kii cabinet kaa virodh karke aap janata ke hero ban jaaenge
 Brother, if only a few months old party can mind your 'strong and developing' Chief Minister, and can make all your mlas of Delhi fit in one SUV, then you have a very serious self- There is a need to brainstorm, which you will not do
 pataa he kyon? kyonki aap khaas aadmi party ke wo khasmkhas netaa hai, jinhen satta kaa singhaasana viraasat main mila he, mehnat se nahin, or aapke ird-gird chapaluson kii puri fouj taiyaar he
 But now be careful! Even if it is not accompanied by Chanakya, but a Chandragupta has come up to shake your throne

 ab muharram main yah ek sau chalis rupee litre tak pahunch gaya he
 The report said that instead of keeping the milk shops open at all times, they are being opened for a few hours in the morning and evening
 aise main doodh kaa milanaa koi aasaan kaam nahin rah gaya he
 The report states that milk wholesalers say that they have not increased the price of milk
 maang adhik hone se dukandaar iskaa phayda uthaa rahe honge, unki isamen koi galati nahin he
 The Sindh government has said that it has taken cognizance of the case and called a meeting with dairy farm owners on 13 September
