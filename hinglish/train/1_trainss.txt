 The PM said- '125 crore Indians are waiting for the reception of ASEAN leaders at the 2018 Republic Day celebrations
 ' modi kaa asian deshon ko lekar sakaaratmak ravaiya ye dikhaata he ki dakshin purv asian deshon main bharat apana dabadabaa kaayam karne main laga he

 ASEAN is a group of developing countries

 India primarily wants to partner with ASEAN at 2 points
 wo hai vyapaar or samudri suraksha
 India's major trade is in the South China Sea

 Thus, ASEAN is commercially important for India
 isi vyapaar kii vajah se america, china or japan jaise shaktishaalee desh is samooh main khaasi ruchi rakhte hai
 Modi's invitation was a challenge for China at a time when America had a special dominance in ASEAN
 lekin vakt ke saathchinais kshetra main shaktishaalee banakar ubhara or is lihaaj se asian main uskaa dabaadabaa kaayam ho gaya
 Modi being positive about ASEAN is a challenge for China to maintain its dominance

 But this step of Modi is considered a master stroke
 isse asian ke saath bharat kaa sambandh or majboot hoga
 America is also supporting India in establishing India's dominance in Asia
 vajah he ki america khule taur se is kshetra main china se takaraav nahin chahta
 Because of this, India is being backed up against China
 haalanki asian main shaamil desh china se khaase prabhavit rahete hai
 One reason for this is the aggressive attitude of China

 Delhi Police had recently refused to allow the Hazare side to fast at Jantar Mantar, saying that no one group could be allowed to claim there indefinitely

 The Hazare side expressed satisfaction at this location

 On whether the department has given a no-objection certificate, Manish Sisodia, close to Hazare, said, "the CPWD has not approved yet
 ’yah puche jane par ki jab sansad kii sthaayee samiti lokapal vidheyak par vichaar kar rahi he, to hazaare kii anshan par jane kii yojana par sarkaar kaa kya rukh he, chidambaram ne kaha, ‘harek vyakti ko virodh pradarshan kaa adhikaar he or paristhitiyaan faisla karengi ki koun sahi tha yaa or koun galat
 Chidambaram said that the previous fast of the Hazare side was probably correct, as the Lokpal Bill was not ready at that time, but it is not appropriate now because the bill has been introduced in Parliament and the government has already taken steps on it

 Right from that day, block development officials across Bihar have decided to go on an indefinite strike

 Accusing the state government, the state block development officer said that the intention of the Bihar government is to keep the organization of block development officers weak
 gramin vikaas sangh rajya sarkaar se bihar gramin vikaas seva punargathan or vetan visangati main sudhaar ko lekarlagataar maang kar rahaa he
 The Rural Development Association held talks with the department's secretary about their demands and sought to rectify the salary discrepancy, but despite assurances the government had not taken any step so far

 The State Block Development Officer informed that all the Block Development Officers of Bihar will go on an indefinite strike from February 1
 saath hi unhone kaha ke iske kaaran puure bihar main sarkari kaam lagbhag thap ho jaaenge

 In fact, Article 370 has been trying to spread panic in the Aatanki Valley ever since the withdrawal of Article 370 and the formation of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir
 aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai isliye ho rahi he kyonki aatanki lagaataar dehshatgardi failaana chaah rahe hai
 Recently, terrorists once again attacked security forces in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav se sabak lekar vipakshi partiyaan aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon or loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke vijay rath ko rokane ko lekar alert ho gai hai
 BJP emerged as the single largest party due to Congress and JDS contesting separately in Karnataka elections
 haalanki bahumat se aath siten dur rah gai, jiske chalate karnataka kii yediurppa sarkaar gir gai or dakshin main bijepi kaa dwaar ek baar phir se band ho gaya
 In Abkarnataka, Kumaraswamy of JDS is going to form the government with the support of Congress
 buudhvaar ko wo mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 JDS and Congress contested separately in Karnataka, but after the election, Congress declared support to JDS to prevent BJP from forming the government
 mana ja rahaa he ki agar congress or jedies milakar chunaav ladate, to inke khate main zyada siten aa sakati thim
 Not only this, if the two parties come together in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then it may be difficult for the BJP in Karnataka to repeat the 2014 election results
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se tulana karen, to loksabhaa chunaav main phir rajya kii 28 loksabhaa siton main se 22 siton par congress-jedies kaa kabja hoga
 Tactics to prevent the votes being split against the BJP, while taking lessons from the Karnataka election results, now the opposition parties have started devising a new strategy to prevent the votes against the BJP from being split in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 samaajawaadee party (SP), bahujan samaaj party (BSP) or congress jaisi vipakshi partiyon kaa tark he ki yah bijepi virdohi voton kaa bantwaaraa hi tha, jiske chalate karnataka main bijepi sabase badi party banakar saamne ai
 BSP SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said that there would be a strategy in the upcoming elections to ensure that anti-bjp votes are not divided
 isse bijepi ko kisi tarah kaa phayda nahin milegaa
 Now there is a need to contest elections strategically
 unhone kaha ki yah safalataa ekajutata se hasil kii ja sakati he, jiskaa udhaaharan phulpur or gorakhpur main bakhubi dekhne ko mila
 In both these places, the SP defeated the BJP with the help of the BSP
 is maamle main rashtriya lok dal (ralod) ke pravaktaa anil doobe ne kaha ki samaan vichaaron vaali sabhi partiyon ko bijepi ko rokane ke liye ek manch par aana chahie
 Ramesh Dixit, former head and political analyst of Lucknow University's Department of Political Science, says the lesson to be learned from the Karnataka elections is that only a united opposition can stop the BJP and previous figures prove this
 congress na dohraye karnataka jaisi galatibijepi ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main rokane ke liecongressko karnataka chunaav ke dauraan kii gai galatiyon ko dohraane se bachanaa hoga, taaki vipakshi ekta main kisi tarah kii daraar na aae
 If the Congress repeats the mistake, it will directly benefit the BJP
 basapa supremeo mayawati kaa bhi kahana he ki congress ko wo galati dobaaraa nahin kerani chahie, jo usne muslim bahul ilaakon main prachaar ke dauraan kii thi, jahaan usne janata dal (secular) ko bijepi kii ‘bi-team’ bataaya tha
 He said, "I suggest to the Congress not to use such language in future, which can help BJP and RSS in upcoming elections
" ''vipakshi partiyon main piem pad ko lekar pencagamee loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraane ke liye ekajute hoti ja raheen vipakshi partiyon ke bich piem pad ko lekar pench funs saktaa he
 Not all parties are yet to consider Rahul Gandhi as the contender for the post of PM
 is maamle main uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa kahana he ki congress adhyaksh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa, ye samay tay karegaa
 He said that the Samajwadi Party's friendship with the Congress will continue till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 karnataka ke ghatnakram par akhilesh ne kaha ki supreme court kii vajah se desh main loktantr main bachaa he

 Congress President Sachin Pilot alleged that incidents of mob lynching are taking place in the state's government and the government is responsible for all this, which does not take action against the anti social people

 The government is protecting the punk elements
 sachin ne kaha ki bijepi vidhayak gyandev ahuja se police ko poochtacha kerani chahie ki aakhir kaise unhen is ghatana kii puri jaankaree he
 Is there any involvement with him? aaj somvaar he or log saptahik chuttee bitaakar aaj phir se apane kaam par nikal jaaenge
 Everyone starts feeling a holiday even before the weekend i
e
 Sunday (sunday), but ever wondered when the holiday started in our country
 ek daur aisa bhi tha jab kaam karne waalon ko saptahik chuttee nahin milti thi or logon ko hafte ke saaton din kaam karne ko majaboor hona padaa tha, lekin aaj se 129 saal pehle hamen hamaara pyaara ravivaar mil gaya chuttee manaane ke liye
 There was a long movement in the country to get a weekly holiday and it was started by labor leader Narayan Meghaji Lokhande
 lokhande ne saptahik avkaash ke liye angrejon ke khilaaf lanbaa sangharsh kiya or andolan chalaaya
 It was the effort of his movement that the British rule in 1890, on 10 June, selected Sunday as a weekly holiday for ordinary Indians and gave their recognition
 pehle nahin milti thi chuttibritish raaj main kapadaa or anya kai tarah kii milon main badi sankhya main bhartiya mazdooron kaam karte the
 He had to work all seven days of the week and there was no holiday for him
 mil mazdooron ko ek din kii chuttee ke liye majdoor netaa narayan meghaji lokhande ne apana abhiyaan shuru kiya
 Lokhande proposed to the British rulers for a weekly holiday, but was turned down
 iske baad lokhande ko apana lakshya hasil karne ke liye lanbaa sangharsh karnaa padaa
 After almost 7 years of struggle, the British government had to change its decision and recognized Sunday as a weekly holiday for all Indians
 aisa nahin he ki isse pehle desh main ravivaar ko saptahik avkaash ko koi vyavastha nahin thi
 Prior to this decision, only government employees were given weekly off as Sundays
 lunch brake kii bhi shuruyatmajdoor netaa narayan meghaji lokhande ne bharatiyon ke liye na sirf saptahik avkaash kii vyavastha karai balki unke hi prayaason ke dam par rojaanaa dopaher main aadhe ghante ke liye aaraam karne kaa mauka bhi diya gaya jo aage chalakar lunch brake ban gaya
 The special thing is that the giving of Sunday day as a holiday on a global level started because Sunday is the day for the people of Christian society to pray and go to the church to pray
 isi ko dekhte hue ravivaar ko saptahik avkaash ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya
 Greece, struggling with the economic crisis, finally accepted that there were so many protests against it so far

 - Input IANS maaruti sujuki ke manesar plant (haryana) main contract workars ke bich sulagati hui ashaanti kii aag 18 july ko achaanak bhabhak kar hinsa or aagjanee main badal gai thi
 An HR executive was killed and 96 employees were injured in the incident
 band plant main 21 agast ko kaamkaaj phir se shuru hone ke tatkaal baad sujuki motor corp ke chairman osamu sujuki ek hafte ke liye bharat aae or unhone manesar plant kaa daura karne ke alaava sabhi ghayal karmchaariyon se bhi mulaakaat kii
 Apart from labor dissatisfaction, the number one car manufacturer in India is facing many other problems
 is saal april se july ke dauraan gharelu paisanger whical bazaar main maaruti kii hissedari ghatakar 38
 It is reduced to 6 percent
 2000 main yah hissedari 55
 Was 5 percent
 maaruti ke vittiya aankade bhi achche nahin dikh rahe
 Suzuki, 82, looked calm and comfortable during a special interview in a hotel room in New Delhi with India Today group editor-in-chief Arun Puri and Business Today editor Chaitanya Kalbag
 is dauraan unhone kai ascharyajanak aankade or vivaran bataae
 Here are excerpts from this interview: On the turbulence of Manesar
 is samasya ne sujuki motor corp kii duniyabar main saakh ko daanv par lagaaya he or bharat main maaruti sujuki kii chhavi ko kharaab kiya he
 The incident occurred on 18 July, it has been more than a month
 is hinsak ghatana ke silsile main kai logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, lekin main yah nahin maanata ki is ghatana kii vajah ab tak saaf nahin he
 There were rumors that these people (attackers) would be put in jail for a week or ten days and then they would be released, after which they would become heroes or stars
 aisi unki soch thi
 All those involved in the violence (there were 546 people) have been identified and have been fired
 nishchit rup se ve maaruti sujuki se paisa einthna chaah rahe the, lekin hamane tay kiya ki ham unhen ek rupaya bhi nahin denge
 i believe that the way the union (maruti) has dealt with the management in this dispute is not completely correct
 main ise union-management shramik samasya nahin maanata, main ise aapraadhik krity maanata hum or isse mujhe dhakka laga he
 From 1945 to 1960 we also faced labor problems
 mujhe shramik samasyaon se nipatane kaa (japan main) anubhav he
 Every country has to face labor problem at some time
 kya manesar se unke yaa anya japani niveshkon ke bharat ke prati nazariye main badlaav aayaa he?meri soch main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 It has been 30 years since we established Maruti Suzuki
 main japan main paidaa hua hum or palaa-badha hum, lekin bharat ko apana doosraa ghar maanata hum
 Mrs
 Indira Gandhi wanted small cars to be produced here, our ideas were being received
 main maaruti ko sujuki parivaar kaa hissaa maanata hum
 i met the Chief Minister of Gujarat (narendra Modi) and also the Chief Minister of Haryana (bhupinder Singh Hooda)
 maine donon logon se saaf taur se kaha he ki haryana meraa pehla ghar he to gujarat doosraa
 (maruti plans to set up a 2,50,000 production capacity car plant annually in Gujarat on 700 acres by 2015-16) Maruti Suzuki will end the contract worker system at all its plants? hamaare yahaan to japan main bhi contract karmchaariyon kii vyavastha he
 The ratio of permanent employees there is 65 to 70 percent and the contract worker ratio is 30 to 35 percent
 japan main thekedaar ke madhyam se jo bhi karmchaaree aate hai, sujuki motor sidhe unki jaanch or chaanbin karti he
 We get to know the entire history of the employees there and their previous functioning
 ham unki shaikshanik yogyata, unke kariyar kaa itihaas, unke ghar kaa pataa, naam sab kuch jaanate hai
 But whoever the contractor brings here is working unconditionally
 thailand or indonesia ke hamaare kaarkaanon main contract varkar ko ek shapathpatr par dastakhat karne hote hai ki yadi unhone thik se kaam nahin kiya yaa company ke niyam tode to unhen baahar nikaal diya jayega
 So, i think we have to implement such systems rigorously
 bharat main contract varkar or niyamit varkar ke bich kaa anupaat 50:50 he
 In Japan this ratio is 30:70
 isliye ham yahaan bhi is anupaat ko badalakar japan kii tarah kaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Maruti Suzuki's declining market share in the country
 ji haa, main bazaar hissedari ko lekar chintit hum
 But no single car manufacturer in North America or Europe has a share of 55 per cent, 50 per cent or even 40 per cent
 
 
 vahaan yah asambhav he
 There are at least 20 global car manufacturers in India
 lekin sabase pehle maaruti sujuki motor ne bhartiya bazaar main paith banaai thi, isliye ham 40 fisadi bazaar hissedari ko banaae rakhane kii harsambhav koshish karenge
 Did Maruti Suzuki not understand India's diesel car market properly and entered it too late? Suzuki has small cars
 hamaare paas e or bi segment main choti kaaren hai
 But there are no cars in the c or d segment, or SUV segment
 hamen apni bazaar hissedari banaae rakhni he to nishchit rup se puraa range rakhana hoga
 In the last 30 years (since Maruti started in India) for 20 years, 80 to 90 percent share of small cars
 bharat main logon kii aamadani badaae se badi gadibhan kharid sakane vaale graahakon kaa anupaat badha he
 The economy progresses and people move from small cars to big cars
 aap ne sahi kaha ki maaruti sujuki dijal gadipoon kaa utpaadan nahin kar rahi thi
 Hence our entry into the diesel market was delayed
 keemat sambandhi nitiyon ko dekhte hue hi dijal kii jagah petrol kaaron ko aage badhaayaa gaya tha
 We could not understand the government policy of difference in prices of petrol and diesel that after a while the price of diesel will increase and this difference will be less
 maaruti sujuki ke ghatate profit margin par (sujuki motor ke is tex munaafe main maaruti sujuki kaa 30 fisadi tak yogadan hota he)
 There is also the issue of royalty and exchange rate
 phiet dijal ingine kaa udhaaharan len, japan kii sujuki (sujuki motor) ne is technology ko apanaaya or baad main hamane ise maaruti ko saunp diya
 So now Japan Suzuki is giving royalty to Fiat and Maruti SMC is giving royalty to Japan
 
 
 ek or bada masalaa exange rate kaa he
 Twenty years ago, it was a win-win for both of them
 lekin main yadi sirf 20 saal pehle kii sthiti ko hi dekhuunga to yah sahi nahin hoga kyonki main purnataa main dekhtaa hum
 So like 20 years ago when Japan Suzuki invested more than 30% in Maruti
 
 
 is bindu ko ab bhi nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 What is driving them forward? Work, work, work

 We are surprised that why China stopped the Manasarovar Yatra while Dhokla and Nathula are very much distance
 unhone kaha ki china shaayad bharat ke longo ko apni takat dikhaanaa nahin chahta or isi liye suraksha kaa hawala dekar maansarovar yatra ko roak rahaa he

 Ever since Tejas Express, the country's first private train started operating between Lucknow and Delhi, there has been a lot of discussion on social media about it
 aise main ek viral post main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki tejas main kharaab khaanaa parosa ja rahaa he, jisase kai yatri biimaar ho gaye or kuch ko to isiu main bhi bhartee karana padaa
 The Facebook page 'viral in India' uploaded a post on 30 October, writing, 'this hall is one of the best trains in the country
 ' post main tejas train kaa photo, saath main train main parose jane vaale khaane kaa photo lagaaya gaya he or uske upar likhaa gaya he, 'maut se mila rahi tejas express
 'below the photo is written,' Tejas's food worsens the condition of 24 passengers, 3 passengers are fighting for life and death in ICU
 ' is post par log tarah tarah ke coment kar rahe hai, jaise- 'aa gaye achche din' or 'har jagah ghotaalaa' vagairah

 yahi postaphesbukapar kuch or logon ne post kii he or 'daily bihar' naam kii ek website ne bhi ise khabar ke taur par pesh kiya he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the claim being made in the post is misleading
 darasal, ye maamla 2017 kaa he
 At that time some passengers had complained of ill health, but no one was admitted to the ICU
 AFWA ne padtaal ke liye sabase pehle ''tejas' 'biimaar' 'yatri' shabdon ko internet par search kiya to paaya ki oktober, 2017 main aisi khabaren saamne ai thim
 26 people were taken ill in the high speed Tejas train coming from Goa to Mumbai, who were admitted to the hospital in Chiplun
 chiploon, mumbai se takreeban 250 kilometre dur maharashtra main he
 It can be read about in Amar Ujala and Janajanata
 in reports ke mutabik, 15 oktober 2017 ko tejas main yatra kar rahe logon ko subah kaa naashtaa diya gaya tha, jiske baad log biimaar ho gaye the
 a proper investigation was set up in this case and the Railways also submitted a report stating that no one had become ill due to railway food
 ek saath yatra kar rahe kuch log biimaar hue the jo apana khud kaa khaanaa kha rahe the or train main do bacchon ke ulti karne se coach main maujuud sabhi logon ko tabiyat kharaab lagane lagi thi
 The news related to this can be read on the website of Bhaskara
 AFWA ne is maamle main iarsitisi or railway board ke adhikariyon se bhi baat kii
 Narendra Pipil, Joint General Manager, Catering Division of Western Zone of IRCTC said, “in 2017 such a case of food poisoning came to light
 tunrat jaanch baithai gai thi or railway ke parose khaane main kuch kharabi nahin pai gai thi
 No one was seriously ill in this case
 koi isiu main nahin tha
 'in this case, on the second day, all the admitted people were discharged from the hospital
 railway board ediji public relation shyama prasad ne kaha, 'bhartiya railway main teen tejas trainen chalati hai or pichley do dinon main aisi koi shikaayat hamen nahin mili he
 'apparently, the news of 2017 is being viral once again as 2019

 Memories of bubbles and froth rising from its waters are still fresh
 1965 se main niyamit rup se naanaa ke gaanv cherangala jaaya karata tha, jab ve jivit the tab unke saath rahane ke liye, jab ve nahin rahe to unhen shraddhasuman arpit karne ke liye
 We had to walk to Bhagmondala's bus stop and walk to his house

 There was no electricity in the house
 ham raat main kerosine ke lamp jalaate the
 Food was cooked on wood
 lakdi kii maddhim aanch par sinki akki (chaaval) kii rotiyaan bahut swaadisht hoti thim
 We used to pluck cashew fruit from the garden and roast it on the flame of wood, and its seeds were hotly rubbed
 phoos se ghire ek talab main nahaate the
 There were no toilets, so we used to go to the nearby bushes and again and again look back and see if there is any snake or wild animal coming
 21veen sadi ke pehle dashak kii shuruyaat se gaanvon kii tasviir badalani shuru hui
 We no longer needed to walk to reach the house

 However, the troubles are still the same to which my maternal grandfather used to complain when he was alive
 kheton main jarurat se zyada uga dhan jis bhav par bechnaa padataa tha, usase dhan kii laagat bhi vasuul nahin hoti thi
 The price of coffee, the main plantation crop of this area, used to fluctuate a lot and laborers were found very expensive for its cultivation

 Welcome to a new India like Kodagu, which has experienced a revolutionary change in the midst of all the contradictions since India Today (english) magazine was launched 43 years ago
 samruddhi kaa swaad chakhne ke baavjood, gramin ilaakon main vishesh rup se krishi morche par sankat pehle jaisaa hi bana hua he
 The contradictions are clearly visible
 in chaar dashakon main centre or rajya kii sarkaron ne apane sansadhano kaa istemaal karke 30 lakh kilometre kii koltar vaali sadakon ke nirmaan kaa record banaaya jinase ab desh ke 6,40,867 gaanv apane nikatatam shaharon se jud gaye hai
 Till last year, nearly 100 percent of the villages in India have been electrified and about 83 percent of rural households are now illuminated with electric bulbs at night
 gaanvon main jaruratmandon ke liye awaas uplabdh karaane ke liye ek yojana ke tahat, pichley chaar varshon main 1 karod ghar banaae gaye hai or isamen pehle kii tulana main chah guna vaarshik vruddhi darj hui thi
 More than nine crore toilets were built under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan since 2014 and 5
 3 lakh gaanvon ko khule main shouch se mukt ghoshit kiya gaya he

 LPG has now reached nearly 50 percent of rural households
 sabase garib parivaar bhi mobile phone kawarej main aa gaya he or iskaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 After becoming the largest producer of milk by the White Revolution, India also witnessed the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions

 It is 7 percent

 Infant mortality has dropped significantly since independence, but we are still at a higher level than neighboring countries like Bangladesh
 lagbhag 35 pratishat yaa gaanvon main rahane vaala teen main se ek baccha, abhi bhi kuposhan kaa shikaar he
 In the field of education, enrollment at the primary and secondary levels is the same but the rate of dropping out of high school education is very high and only 11
 6 pratishat log snaatak tak padhai karte hai
 Many studies have shown that the standard of learning is very poor even for those who enroll in schools
 krishi main khadyann or daalon kaa utpaadan record str tak pahunch gaya he jisase bharat bhojan main aatmanirbhar ho chukaa he
 But it has given rise to many problems due to which farmers across the country often lodge strong protests against less than the cost of farming
 desh main menuphaccharing or udyog main ai baari mandi ke kaaran kisaanon kaa sankat bad gaya he
 Not enough jobs are being created where unemployed agriculture sector can spend
 ab bharat ke kul shram bal kaa 54 pratishat khetihar majdoor hai, lekin unki utpaadakta unke shahari samakakshon ke mukaable aadhi he
 Therefore, if, in the words of Charles Dickens, it is the best time for the villages of India, it is also the worst time ever
 ham ise nayaa bharat kyon kehete hai jabaki yah abhi bhi apane sabhi arase puraane sankaton se usee prakaar ghira dikhataa he? bada antar yah he ki gaanvon main rahane vaali bharat kii 69 pratishat aabaadi main ab apane haathon apni kismat sanvaarane kii chatapataahat dikhne lagi he
 Or they just don't want to keep staring at the government to solve all their problems
 yah parivartan vishesh rup se gramin mahilaon main dikhaai detaa he jo ghar sanbhaalane ke saath ab bas kheton main kaam karne tak simat kar nahin rahanaa chaahatin
 They have started thinking ahead
 10 karod se adhik mahilaon ne milakar 7,17,689 swayan sahaayta samoohon (esaechaji) kaa gathan kiya he or ab samuhik rup se vibhinn prakaar kii aarthik gatividhiyon main lagi hai jisane unhen aay to hoti hi he, sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki unki apni pahchaan banati he
 It is probably the largest self-employment movement in the world, which is also earning confidence with money

 He has a very good debt repayment record
 or ve ek mook lekin badi kranti laa rahi hai
 India Today correspondents have found inspiring examples from across the country which are proof that people coming from rural backgrounds are not only changing their lives, but also becoming a visionary for others, while taking the path through all the difficulties
 rajasthan kii rumaa devi kii 17 saal kii umr main shaadi hui tab unhen bas thodaa bahut kadhai kaa kaam aata tha
 For the purpose of increasing household income, he formed a self-help group to create handicrafts
 jab samooh ke sadasyon ko yah pataa chalaa ki agar ve bichauliyon par ashrith hone ke bajaae apane taiyaar utpaadon ko sidhe bech den to munafa kai guna zyada ho saktaa he, to unhone bank se rin lekar kaccha maal kharida or vyapaar kaa vistaar kiya
 Ruma Devi then joined an NGO, Rural Development Chetna Sansthan and started training there and slowly progressed and was elected president of that NGO
 ab yah enjio 75 gaanvon main sakriy he or isane ab tak 11,000 se adhik dastkaron ko prashikshit kiya he
 Ruma Devi encouraged her team members to make modern costumes using traditional methods and designs
 top, skirt, dupatton or salwar suut par paramparaagat dizin or pattern aae to logon ne ise haathon-haath liya
 The news of his work also reached the top designers of the country and they came to him and now started buying his clothes
 30 varshiya rumaa devi, mahila shashaktikaran kii apurv safalataa kaa utkrisht udhaaharan hai
 In the following pages, we have brought many similar heart touching stories
 kisaanon ke virodh pradarshnon main haal hi main jo teji ai he, vah bataati he ki gramin hindustan ab jaagruk ho gaya he or apane hakon kaa daawa kar rahaa he
 Farmers are now demanding more than plagiarism solutions such as debt waiver, as solutions like debt waivers portray them as villains and they only benefit those who manipulate the system by taking advantage of it

 This tragedy could have been avoided if a radical change had been made in agricultural practices with the economic reform process that started in 1991, but it did not happen
 niti nirmaataaon ne apana sara dhyaan faqat utpaadan badhaane or aatmanirbharta laane par laga diya or isi disha main aage badhate rahe
 They avoided taking any major risk, fearing to annoy India's largest vote bank

 One ignominy of India was that it failed to amend various land laws
 nateeja yah hua ki jot kaa tukdon main bantna sangeen str par pahunch gaya
 To the extent that a large number of farmers cultivate less than one hectare of land
 chunki aise koi kanoon nahin laae gaye jo jameen ke is sankat ko kam kar pate, isliye contract farming, nai-nai technology or laagat main anupatik sudhaar kii prakriyaaon ne jaden nahin pakadin
 Also, issues of agricultural logistics, post-harvest process and selling products were also ignored

 Other mistakes also occurred
 is baat kii saaf jarurat he ki krishi ko gharelu or audyogic khapat ke saath joda jaae or fasalon main jarurat ke hisaab se vividhta laai jaae
 But the result of an indiscriminate emphasis on undisclosed cereals is that a stock of as large as 50 million tonnes is being kept in the public distribution system — more than double the annual food entitlement of all BPL families in the country
 ek or misaal len, hamen gharelu khapat ke liye mahaj 2
 50 million tons of sugar is needed, but we 3 to 3
 6 karod ton chini kaa utpaadan karte hai
 On the other hand, till July this year, the policy of the government prohibited the conversion of it to non-food uses like making ethanol
 2019 main chaahe jo party satta main aae, yah ummid kerani hi chahie ki vah kisaanon kii takalifon ko khatm karne ke liye bade krishi sudhaaron kaa kaam haath main lene ko apane ghoshnaptr main jarur shaamil karegi
 In other important areas that are impacting Meen's progress, it can be thankful that the central and state governments have learned from past mistakes
 jaruratmandon ko gramin awaas muhaiyaa karnaa aisa hi ek kaam he
 Housing programs have been introduced since 1985, but they have been implemented loosely and corruption has been unbridled
 jab narendra modi kii aguai main endie sarkaar satta main ai, tab isane is kaarykram kaa kayakalp kiya
 He also changed its name to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 banaae jane vaale makaanon kaa aakaar 20 varg meter se badhaakar 25 varg meter kar diya or sahaayta rakam bhi badhaakar 70,000 rupye se badhaakar 1

 magar jo baat sabase ahm thi, vah yah ki digital or sanchaar technology kaa istemaal karke bhrashtachar par lagaam kas di gai
 At the time of payment of the first installment, the person receiving the aid money has to upload his picture and the picture of the plot on which he is going to build the house
 phir us shaks ko tay kaarykram ke mutabik nirmaan ke harek pramukh stage par tab tak taiyaar makaan kii taswaaren bhejni hoti hai, tabhi use agali kist milti he
 The subsidy amount is deposited directly into the bank account of the person from which it is not possible to use it for any other work
 isse sthaneey afasaron ke haathon bhrashtachar 50 fisadi se kam hokar takreeban 12 fisadi par aa gaya he
 In the last four years, a large number of houses have been constructed in record
 ek bura nateeja bhi hua haih panchayat str ke afasar is kaarykram ko utsaah se aage nahin badha rahe hai kyonki bhrashtachar kii rakam unke haathon main nahin pahunch rahi he
 Another welcome work has been that all the services available under the Discrete schemes have been clubbed together
 lihaaja awaas yojana ke tahat makaan banavaa rahaa shaks svachh bharat ke tahat shauchalay ke liye bhi sabsidi hasil kar saktaa he, pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke tahat rasoi gas kaa conection le saktaa he or gramin vidyutikaran kaarykram ke tahat bijli kaa conection le saktaa he
 Since all this money goes directly to the bank account, there has been a dramatic reduction in the chances of corrupt officials stopping or withdrawing this payment
 ye suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karwaane ke baad yah bhi pakkaa karnaa behad ahm he ki in sevaaon kii gunvattta ke saath koi samjhauta na kiya jaae
 It is not enough to install an electric pole in the village, it should also have a good supply of electricity
 sabsidi par di gai alpiji main riphil kii suvidha aasaani se muhaiyaa karwaani hogi, yah nahin ki premium par di jaae
 a new and important thing has been added in the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana that in addition to building the road itself, the matter of maintenance for five years has also been included in the contract which the contractor has to follow
 aise main uske saamne iske alaava koi chaara nahin hota ki vah sadak banane main achche kism ke sazosaman kaa istemaal kare
 Some other schemes of the government have given excellent results in the past as well
 1982 main jab em
 Yes
 ramchandran tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri the, ve mid-de mile yojana laae the
 At that time, i wrote an article for this magazine and rejected it as a populist scheme
 magar iskaa asar antat krantikari sabit hua
 Within a few years of the introduction of this scheme, there was a significant decline in child mortality in the state
 phir sarkaar ne chaturaai se is yojana main un garbhvatee maataaon ko bhi shaamil kar liya jo apane bacchon ko chhodie skool aati thim
 They were not only given a package of food but also medicines for protection of the womb
 phir unhen prasav ke baad kii dekhbhaal or phaayde bhi die jane lage
 As a result, the state saw a significant reduction in maternal mortality
 saamaajik yojanaayen banane vaale yah dekhakar hairaan rah gaye ki tamilnadu kii prajnan daron main acchhee-khaasi giravat aane lagi or ve un staron par pahunch gayi jo ek dashak ke bheetar keval kerala ne hasil kii thim
 Care is another story of success
 80 ke dashak main health kii story ke liye jab main rajasthan gaya tha, tab 10 main se keval do shishuon kaa janm aspataalon main hota tha
 The remaining eight were born at home only with the help of raw tools that were used by the midwives
 aaj rajya main 10 main se aath bachche aspataalon yaa aisi sansthaaon main janm lete hai
 These are laudable stories of success, but it is not enough for governments to be satisfied by providing basic facilities
 madhya 1980 ke dashak main tab pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne gramin jal mishan shuru kiya tha
 The government improved the condition of tube wells
 phir usne teji se kuon kii khudaai or tubewel lagane kaa intjaam kiya
 However, there were some issues regarding how many wells should be dug in each village and how many of them would be different for Dalits and Muslims
 magar isane un gaanvon main pani muhaiyaa karne ke maamle main kayapalat kar diya jahaan mahilaon ko pani laane ke liye milon chalakar janaa padataa tha
 During the severe drought of 1987, i visited many states and found that the hand pumps had given a great relief and due to this Rajiv Gandhi's government was able to overcome this crisis successfully
 us vakt gaanv ke log pani bharne ke liye hand panpon par jamaa hone ke liye taiyaar the, ab ve sidhe apane gharon main pani kii aapurti ke vaaste nal kii vyavastha ke liye cheekh-pukaar machaa rahe hai, khaskar tab jab unhone shaharon ke logon ko aisi suvidha kaa istemaal karte dekha he
 Nevertheless, providing this facility to them is not going to be easy both in terms of cost and availability
 halaat abhinav samaadhaanon or jan bhagidaari tathaa sahyog kii maang karte hai jise sweekaar karnaa or amal main laana hoga
 My parents left their villages in Kodagu and came to live in other places to earn a living from other occupations, there were strong reasons for this
 vahi vajahen ab bhi kaayam hai, jinke chalate logon kaa hujum naukariyon kii talash main gaanvon se shahari hindustan kaa rukh kar rahaa he

 On Friday, a three-judge bench comprising the country's Chief Justice TS Thakur asked the government why 75 judges had not been appointed so far despite the Collegium's recommendation? SC asked who is stuck with the case? Chief Justice Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi Asked if the collegium had been recommended for 8 months, so far there have been no arguments
 After all, who has blocked appointments? After which case has the matter stopped? Justice Thakur said that if the government has any objection to any name, it can send it back to the Collegium with enough documents and reasons but not taking any decision on the recommendations stops the whole process
 'centre ne ab tak kuch nahin kiya'supreme court ne kaha ki colegium ne hoicourt main jajon kii niyukti ke liye 75 logon kii list bheji thi, lekin centre ne ab tak is par kuch nahin kiya
 The Supreme Court told the Attorney General that now the time has come for the court to intervene and give a judicial order

 On Monday, the Mayor of North and East Delhi visited the Chhat Ghats and took stock of the preparations

 --- input from IANS hamamen se zyaadaatar logon ko yahi lagata he ki chaaval keval pet bharne ke liye hi khaaya jaataa he
 It is not very beneficial in terms of health
 kai log to ye sochakar bhi chaaval khaane se parhez karte hai ki chaaval khaane se unka pet baahar aa jayega
 Despite being a major element of Indian food, the health benefits of rice are unseen
 hamaare gharon main chaaval banataa to har roj he lekin keval isliye kiye aahaar kaa hissaa he
 There are very few people who like to cook and eat it as healthy food
 par aapako ye jaanakar hairat hogi ki jis aahaar ko baaki kii tulana main itnaa kam aanka jaataa he uske dheron phaayde hai
 1
 chaaval main acchhee maatra main carbohydrate hota he jokisharir ko urja dene kaa kaam karata he
 Every part of the body needs this energy
 mastishk isi urja se sharir kaa sanchaalan karata he
 The energy obtained from rice also keeps the metabolism activity regular
 2
 Eating rice is very beneficial for health
 isamen na to hanikaarak fat hota he na cholestrol or na hi sodium
 This is a balance diet
 ye baat jaananaa bahut jaruri heki agar koi khaadya padaarth bina kisi nuksaan ke phayda de rahaa he to usase behatar kuch bhi nahin he
 3
 chaaval main sodium kii maatra na ke baraabar hoti he
 In such a situation, it is best for those who have high blood pressure and hypertension
 4
 Whole grain rice, such as brown rice, is rich in fiber
 chaaval main paaya jane vaala ye fibre bahut prakaar ke cancer kii rokthaam or usase bachaav ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Many researchers believe that these elements present in rice do not allow cancer cells to grow
 5
 Rice maad is also used as a beauty product
 ye twachaa sambandhi kai tarah kii bimariyon main phydemand he
 The antioxidant properties present in it prevents wrinkles from coming in and keeps away from the effects of aging
 6
 Eating light wet rice is very beneficial in diarrhea
 puraane samay main to ise bataur dawa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 It is also used as a good and easy to digest food in China

 kya aapako pataa he ki duniya kaa sabase acha camera koun sa he?aap apana jawaab sochen tab tak ek choti si kahani bataata hum
 i have a close friend - a famous reporter of a big TV channel
 photography kaa unhen aisa jabardast shauk he ki camera, lens, trypod, filters or photography kii kitabon par lakhon rupee kharch kar chuke hai
 Different types of camera-lenses, such that if you sell the entire camera bag, a new car might come! He is irritated by the mobile phone camera
 ise wo 'khilonaa', 'tutapujia' or 'photography ke liye kalank' maanate hai
 Therefore, they keep a Blackberry phone that does not have a camera
 kedarnath main jab bhayankar tabaahi hui to reporting ke liye wo aanan-fanan main vahaan bhaage
 Now, where there was no road or road to the car, how could he carry his heavy camera bag! To reach Kedarnath, it was difficult to carry as much luggage for TV reporting as possible by several days' walk over the mountains
 aakhirkaar, jaan kii baaji lagaakar kisi tarah wo pahunche
 The reporting which he did by chance, was praised in the country and the world
 lekin mere dost khud kehete hai ki is behad khatarnaak or yaadgaar anubhav kaa koi photo nahin le paane kaa afsos unhen jindagi bhar rahegaa
 
 
 Now you understand that the best camera in the world is the one that you have at the time of need
 or ye camera he aapke mobile phone kaa
 Whether to create a new profile picture on Facebook or share a memorable moment with friends - this is the camera that supports you on every occasion
 ye sach he ki bade camaron ke mukaable mobile phone kaa camera kai maamalon main 'bechaara' hota he
 But it is also true that just by buying a gun does not become a shooter
 aaie, jaanate hai ki kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhkar kaise ham mobile ke camere se bhi dil jeetne vaali photo le sakate hai
 1
 clic se pehle :camere kii settings check karen -kya kabhi aapane apane mobile phone ke camere ko on karne ke baad uski centings main jhaank kar dekha he? tricks kaa kaisaa khajaana chipa he vahaan! phone ke model ke hisaab se aapako vahaan shooting mods, effects, timer, iesao, jeepies, guidelins
 
 
 All such things will be seen
 saare settings kii baat karke uljhane ke bajaay, main aapako sirf behad jaruri kuch baaten bataata hum
 Select 'superfine' (or best of all, excellent, or 100 percent, whatever is written) in the settings of 'image quality'
 iske baad risolution main jaakar jo bhi sabase zyada risholution dikh rahaa ho use salect karen
 More resolution means that the file of the photo will become bigger and you can also get a good print out of it
 agar aapke camere yaa memory card main jagah kam pad rahi ho to risolution kam karen lekin 'image quality' ko bilkul kam mat karen
 If the phone camera has 'anti shake mode' then turn it on
 camere kaa lens saaf karen -aage padhane se pehle, apane mobile phone ke camera lens ko jaraa tirachha karke dhyaan se dekhen
 Don't see fingerprints? There is no lens cover to protect the phone's camera
 isliye jane-anjaane main aapaki ungliyaan isapar lagati rahati hai
 These hidden marks, dust and dirt are the enemies of your photo that blur your photo
 photo lene se pehle lens ko ek mulaayam kapade se ponch len
 Glass cloth cleaning will be fine for this
 chalakar or kareeb jaaen -aap jis cheez kii photo lenaa chaahate hai, chalakar uske jitna paas ho sake jaaen
 It has three advantages
 ek to photo kii quality behatar hogi, doosraa aapke frem se phaltu kii chijen hat jaaengi or teesraa ye ki agar photo lete vakt camera hill bhi gaya to iskaa photo par kam asar padegaa
 Not only is the lens of the camera of the mobile phone small, but the 'sensor' is the most important part of converting the light into a photo
 lens or sensor kii is kami se nipatane kaa sabase aasaan tarika he paas se photo lenaa
 Make arrangements to increase the light - Photo is entirely a game of 'light' and 'shadow'
 kuch chuninda mahange mobile phone ko chhod den, to zyaadaatar phone ke camaron kii sabase badi majaburi hi yahi he ki wo kam lite main acchhee photo nahin le pate
 Understand this compulsion of your camera
 jisaki photo leni ho, sambhav ho to use din ke ujaale main laaen
 Otherwise open the windows and doors, remove the curtains, light the lights
 acchhee lite kaa intjaam ho gaya, to samajho aadha kaam ho gaya
 The best light is that which gives light, but does not prick the eyes
 jaise subah or shaam kii lite, yaa phir badal main chhipe suraj kii raushnee
 Choose the right backgroud - The right backgroud is the one in which your real 'subject' (the thing you are taking a photo of) has blossomed
 bekagranud kabhi bhi chamkila, bhadkila yaa itnaa rangeen nahin hona chahie ki asli subject hi uske aage dab jaae
 If you are taking a photo of a person, instead of a flower background, a broken old wall would be better
 kabhi bhi, aapke subject par jitani lite he, bekagranud main usase zyada lite nahin honi chahie
 The backgroud's light should either be less than the subject or the same
 white balance thik karen -white balance thik hone kaa matlab he ki lite kisi bhi rang kii ho, photo main har cheez natural color kii dikhe
 That is, even if the photo bulb is taken in yellow light, the leaves look green and the white shirt white
 agar aap zyada pachade main nahin padana chaahate to white bangles ko 'auto mod' par kar den
 Then by focusing on the thing that needs to be photographed, give the camera a chance to adjust for three to four seconds
 aap dekhenge ki photo kaa tone badal gaya
 If you are an advanced user, then choose other modes of white balance according to the light
 special effectus ko bhul jaaen -camere ke centings main, ho saktaa he aapako lalachaane vaale tarah-tarah ke opshan dikhen
 'black and White', 'cipia Tone', 'cartoon Effect', 'toy Camera Effect', 'negative Effect' and what-to-do
 lekin meri salaah he agar aap inamen se kisi kaa bhi istemaal nahin karenge to phaayde main rahenge
 The reason is simple
 agar aapane sidhi saadi, bina kisi effect ke photo lee he to aap baad main processing ke dauraan, aasaani se manachaaha effect daal sakate hai
 Making color photos, later black and white, is a game of the left hand
 lekin camere main hi agar aapane blike and white mod chun kar photo lee ho, to baad main use rangeen bananaa behad mushkil hoga
 2
 clic ke samay :horigental yaa vertical -aap sabase pehle ye tay karen ke aapaki photo main 'main sabaject' kya he
 Everything seen in any photo, even in the scenery, is not 'subject'
 'subject' wo cheez he jise aap puri tarah se hilite karnaa chaahate hai
 After deciding what the actual subject is, think of whether it would be okay to keep the phone horizontal (in width) to highlight it, or vertical
 ho sake to phone ko donon tarah se pakad kar dekhen
 Most photos look good in horizontal mode and it is easy to make a screen saver on a computer
 lekin profile photo vertical mod main sundar lagate hai
 Whether the phone is straight or horizontal, be careful that the camera is straight, not tilted to any side
 juum ko bhul jaaen -phone camera on karte hi aapako juum karne kaa opshan dikhegaa
 After turning on the camera in most touch screen phones, you can pinch the subject by pinching it with two fingers on the screen (ie with a pinch)
 lekin phone ke camere main juum kaa istemaal kabhi mat karen
 Except some very expensive phones, most phones do not have optical zoom
 or digital juum photo ko barbaad kar detaa he
 In fact, digital zoom is nothing but a marketing tactic to woo people
 lens par sidhi lite bachaaen -yaad kiijie kii jab car kii hedlite aapaki ankho se takaraati he to kya hota he
 The eyes are flashed in such a way that nothing is visible
 yahi haal camere ke lens kaa bhi hota he
 So while taking photos, do not allow any sharp light to fall directly on the camera lens
 jis taraf se lite aa rahi ho, us taraf, aap apane phone ke saath khaden ho taaki sidhi lite aapke subject par pade na ki aapke phone camere ke lens par
 Framing is everything - framing means - what to put in the photo, where to put it and what to try to remove
 iske liye phone ko jaraa idhar-udhar, upar-neeche le jaakar dekhen ki kahaan se sabase sundar frem banataa he
 It is not absolutely necessary that the person you are taking a photo of is seen right in the middle of the frame
 subject ko ekadam bich main daalana akasar photo ko boring bana detaa he
 Take care of the head room (the empty space left over the head), the look room (leave more space before the person is looking)
 'rule of van third' ke bare main jarur padhein or ise lagu karen
 This most important rule of photography says that divide your frame into three parts - your main subject should be in two parts and the third part should be used as a backgroud
 agar aapke camere kii settings main Grid Lines yaa Guidelines he to use on rakhen
 This will help a lot in framing
 flash he dodhari talwaar -mobile phone ke chote se LED falash se lite, ek goli kii tarah nikal kar saamne kii cheez se takaraati he
 This causes the natural feel of the photo to disappear and a portion becomes brighter
 flash kii sidhi tej lite kaa ye bhi matlab he ki ye ek bhaddi si shadow bana sakati he, jo photo kaa majaa kharaab kar detii he
 If the light is low and there is no other light, then it is your compulsion to use flash
 lekin bina flash ke bhi ek do photo lekar rakh len
 If you want to soften the flashing light of the flash, then you can try a thin white paper or white tape in front of it
 baat sunne main ulti lagegi, lekin agar aap tej dhoop yaa tej lite main photo le rahen hon, to failsh kaa istemaal karen
 This can help you reduce shadows
 phone hilaa, photo bekaar -ye baat maaloom to har kisi ko he lekin phir bhi akasar clic karte samay hi phone hill jaataa he
 Always hold the phone with both hands and use the thumb for clicks
 phone chota sa ho, to jis haath main phone he use duusare haath se kalai ke neeche pakade - jaise fire karte samay revolver pakadte hai
 Keep your hands close to the chest till the elbow and while clicking, stop breathing for a moment
 aasapaas kisi cheez se tech laga saken, yaa haath ko tikaa saken to sabase acha he
 If you are taking photos of that, then it is not too moving
 shater-lag kaa dhyaan rakhen -digital camaron kii ek laailaaj beemaari kaa naam he 'shater-lag'
 When you click - the photo is actually taken a little later
 clic karne or asal main photo khinchne ke bich ke faasale ko hi shater lag kehete hai
 Good cameras have little or no shutter lag, while in cheap phones and digital cameras you can feel clean
 shater lag khel kharaab na kare iske liye asal maukey se ek kshan pehle clic karen
 And after clicking one or two seconds keep the phone in the same position without moving
 thodaa bahut angil badal kar teen-chaar photo khinch len taaki baad main sabase behatar chun saken
 3
 clic ke baad :ho sake to photo ko computer par transfar karen -bade screen par photo main aapako kai aisi chijen dikhengi jo phone ke chote se screen par thik se pataa nahin chalatin
 Use Bluetooth to send Fota to a computer without the hassle of a cable
 usase bhi aasaan he photo ko kisi cloud sarvice - jaise dropbox, pikassa yaa google plus par aplod kar den or computer par use downlod kar len
 After looking at the photo on the computer, keep the good photo and make the rest
 ab baari he photo chamakaane kii -photo ko sundar banane ke liye, usamen nai jaan daalane ke liye anditting ke tamaam muft software maujuud hai
 Most people's work will be done with the editing software of 'picasa' or 'google Plus'
 pehle pikchar se phaltu hissaa hataane ke liye use Crop karen
 Then adjust the color, tone and light
 special effectus, jaise blike and white, sepia karnaa chahen, to uski bharmaar he in software ke bheetar
 Editing can also be done inside the phone - sending photos on the computer, if you feel like a mess, then all photo editing apps are available for the phone as well
 photo main jaan daalane ke liye Pixlr Express or Pics Art - Photo Studio shandaar hai
 Download any of these and do as much art as you want with your photo
 photo par special effects jitna chaahe, aajamaayen
 But always save your original photo
 bas, ab photo ko jahaan chahen share karen or shaan se kahen - photo dekho, camera na pucho !lekhak aaj tak ke varisht samvaadadaata hai

 desh ke kai madhya pradesh main chal rahe ab tak ke sabase ugr kisaan andolan ke sutaradhar or rashtriya kisaan majdoor sangh ke adhyaksh shiv kumaar sharma ‘kakkaji’ kabhi aresas ke bhartiya kisaan sangh ke pradesh adhyaksh hua karte the
 But now Sharma, who is completely against the government, spoke openly on the peasant movement
 pesh hai khaas ansh:sawaal: kisaan andolan to ab puraa desh dekh rahaa he, lekin is andolan kii asal vajah kya he?jawaab: kisaan aaj se pareshaan nahin he, shivaraj singh chouhan kii 13 saal kii satta main ve lagaataar luute gaye hai
 The farmers produced bumper pulses this year but their crop is being sold at half the minimum support price
 emspi par fasal khareednaa to sarkaar kii hi jimmedaari he, lekin sarkaar chup markar baithi rahi
 Question: You are talking about cheating of farmers for 13 years, whereas the state is considered a model of agricultural development? Answer: This is the development of false data
 bhaajapa or shivaraj kisaanon ke dushman hai
 The story of rapid development in wheat production in the state is false
 hota yah he ki bhaajapa ke netaa hi rashan ke liye jari hone vaala 2 ru
 We buy a kilo of grain and sell it to MSP in the next season
 anaaj kii ricycling hi badha hua utpaadan dikhaa rahi he
 Loan to farmers at zero interest is a bigger lie than that
 agar koi kisaan 15 march tak lone waapas nahin karata to usase bade hue byaaj or penalty ke saath karj vusla jaataa he
 While everyone knows how the farmer will pay the money by March 15, as his payment starts in late April and May
 sawaal: andolan ke hinsak hone kii kya vajah he?jawaab: kisaan hinsak nahin hue hai, sarkari amala jaanboojhkar unhen uksaata he, taaki kisaanon par lathi-goli chalaane kaa bahaanaa mili
 Instead of trying to get farmers the real value of their crop, Shivraj tried to weaken the movement
 kisaanon kaa sarkari tantra ne daman kiya
 And refused to listen to any of the farmers
 yah hinsa nahin ek dashak kii pidaa se trast ho chuke kisaan kii hataasha kii abhivyakti he
 But now the farmer will not sit silent
 ham jald hi andolan ko deshvyapee swaroop dene kii taiyaari kar rahe hai

 On the issue of removing Article 370, Iltija Mufti said, 'the way of government is absolutely wrong
 yah prakriya puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he
 Such a big decision was taken but the opinion of Kashmiris was not taken
 kashmir main jab paryaton kaa mukhya sijan tha tabhi achaanak paryatakon ko waapas bula liya gaya
 a large number of army personnel were deployed
 hamen laga ki pakistan hamalaa karne vaala he
 Perhaps that's why such preparation is being done
 lekin achaanak anuchhed 370 hataane kaa faisla liya gaya
 Iltija said that removal of Article 370 was spoken about that it would develop Kashmir
 yah galat he, iskaa kashmir ke vikaas se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 The country is in recession
 vikaas dar gir rahaa he
 To suppress these issues, action has been taken to remove Article 370
 iltijaa ne media par bhi sawaal uthaae or kaha ki media kashmir kii ground report nahin dikhaa rahi

 Iltija said while getting emotional that i do not have the right to meet my mother
 kya mujhe apni maa se milane ke liye court janaa padegaa? iltijaa ne aage kaha ki piem modi titliyon ko aaazaad kar rahe hai lekin kashmiriyon ko aazaadee nahin
 He said that the people of Kashmir want independence

 Today the same BJP is putting an emergency in Kashmir
 90 lakh logon ko kashmir main pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 But the government is not worried about it
 jab rajdeep ne poocha ki kashmir kaa aap kaisaa hal chaahate hai
 On this question, he said that this is a problem created by the government
 ab sarkaar hi soche ki kaise iskaa samaadhaan hoga
 But whatever the government has to take the Kashmiris into confidence

 The former Deputy Prime Minister urged the management of 'natya Vidyalaya' to admit students from other provinces as well, because at this time it is dominated only by the people of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar
 unhone yah bhi suzav diya ki yahaan anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke saath hi natya shaastra kii anya vidhaon kii bhi shiksha di jaani chahie

 He asked the mlas, whose image among SP leaders was better for Akhilesh Yadav or Mulayam Singh? The political equation is obvious, the mlas are not mentioning it, but they also know that the internal battle of the SP changed the political equation Huh

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing the booth workers of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, termed the Karnataka government's loan waiver scheme as a cruel joke with farmers
 unhone kaha tha ki 44,000 karod rupee kii karjamaafee kaa laabh mahaj 800 kisaanon ko hi mil paaya
 Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Sunday gave a series of answers to the Prime Minister's comments on the debt waiver, calling it wrong, insensitive and unfortunate
 mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne kaha he ki kisaanon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye karjamaafee hamaari sarkaar kii patibaddhta he or yah prakriya shuru ho chuki he
 Under which significant payments have been made, but it is sad that he (prime Minister) sees a cruel joke in this
 is yojana ke bare main puure tathy ko jane bina ve desh ke logon ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Honorable Prime Minister may note the facts and updates related to farmers' debt waiver before making any wrong remarks: 1
 kisaanon kii karjamaafee ek khuli kitaab he or isaki jaankaree online uplabdh he, jabaki anya rajyon main aisa nahin he

 3
 ham yah sunishchit kar rahe hai ki harek asli kisaan ko iskaa laabh mili

 Kumaraswamy, in his explanation, recalled the Centre's indifference to the performance of farmers in Delhi and said that it is highly undesirable to make fun of the serious efforts of the Karnataka government to waive farmers' debt

 However, there will be further delay in eliminating waste
 ''lekin kachare ke nibataan main ho rahi deree se pradesh sarkaar vichlit nahin he

 notebandi or jiesti ne vipaksh main baithe ek duusare kii virdohi partiyon or netaaon ko kareeb laa diya he
 Perhaps there is a thinking among Modi's opponents that he cannot face Modi alone at this time
 mamata banerjee or uddhav thakare ke mulaakaat se is theory ko bal mil rahaa he
 Let us tell you that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday in Mumbai

 At the same time, his party also periodically clarifies these allegations
 pichley kuch dinon se donon partiyaan soshal media or bayanon se notebandi or jiesti par lagaataar modi sarkaar par hamale kar rahi he
 On one hand, the Aam Aadmi Party has announced to celebrate 8 November as 'dokha Divas'

 Lalu Yadav himself tweeted and attacked Amit Shah and BJP
 lalu ne twit kiya tha ki jahaan ek taraf bharat kii economi ko jiesti or notebandi se nuksaan hua, vahiin amit shah ke bete kii sampatti 300 guna ijapha
 Let us tell you that both leaders have come on a platform in the past in protest against Modi

 The BJP has prepared the CM of Nitish Kumar from Katbihar, PM Narendra Modi has already given a big blow to the opposition

 a day after the official release of his book was canceled due to protests at the Kolkata Book Fair, controversial Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen has claimed that three Bengali film directors planning the film on her life and novels have now pulled back 
 unke jivan tathaa do upanyaason ‘shodh’ or ‘nimantran’ par film nirmaan ke prastaav ke bare main tasalima ne nai dilli se bataaya, ‘qaraar par hastakshar kiye gaye the, lekin nirdeshkon ne achaanak chuppi saadh lee
 Indicating the pressure on the directors, he said, 'I don't know what happened to them
 kisne unhen film banane se roka
 'however, he did not reveal who would have pressured the directors
 nai pustak ke prakashkon ne is bich daawa kiya ki tasalima kii aatmakatha ke saatven hisse ‘nirvaasan’ kii bikri bad gai he
 The book fair organizers were forced to cancel the official release of the book following protests by fundamentalists
 aayojakon dwaara suraksha chintaa kaa hawala die jane ke baad pustak jari karne ke liye nirdhaarit sthal ke baahar ise jari kiya gaya tha
 Shibani Mukherjee of the People's Book Society, publisher, said, 'we have ordered a new edition
 pehle sanskaran kii ek hajaar pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 We are very excited about this sale
 ’pustak meley main bukstor tathaa stall par yah kitaab pehle hi bik chuki he
 The publisher said, 'women in particular are crumbling at our book stall
 ’ unhone saath hi is baat par jor diya ki pustak kii vishay vastu main kuch bhi vivaadaaspad nahin he
 The book contains memoirs from the author after Taslima was sent out from Kolkata in November 2007
 bangla main likhi gai kitaab main un halaaton kaa zikr kiya gaya he jinke chalate sarkaar ne unhen nai dilli bhej diya or jiske parinamswaroop unhen maansik tanaav tathaa beghar hone kii asuraksha se guzarana padaa
 Taslima said, 'the book is not an issue from anywhere
 tasalima mudda he
 'he said,' Neither the fundamentalists nor the people of the government have read the book
 agar koi ‘tasalima flower sho’ kaa aayojan karata he, to ve usapar bhi pratibandh lagane kii maang karenge
 The 49-year-old Taslima had to leave Bangladesh in 1994 after allegedly hurting religious sentiments through her novel 'lajja'
 dilli hoicourt ne vriddhavastha or vidhwaa pension ko vidhayak ke jariye relies karne se jude cese main dilli sarkaar ke faisle ko nirast kar diya he
 The process of getting pension will now be applicable as before
 pension lene vaale log sarkari portal par hi jaakar applai kar sakate he
 The Delhi government had stopped the online pension
 itnaa hi nahin soshal welfare offis ko bhi sarkaar ne band kar diya tha
 For pension, we had to apply in MLA office itself
 password bhi vidhayak karyaalay se hi applai karne par miltaa tha
 Due to this, people were finding it difficult to reach mla's office from public transport
 ek aarope ye bhi tha ki vidhayak karyaalay main party se jude logon ko hi laabh diya ja rahaa tha
 There was no schedule for pension in these offices
 is vajah se vruddh or vidhwaaen pension ke liye dhakke khaane ke liye majaboor thim
 After which the Delhi High Court had sought an answer from the Secretary of Social Welfare Department of Delhi Government on the last hearing, on which they said that people were facing problems due to the requirement of Aadhaar card
 isliye tay kiya gaya ki yah pension vidhayak ke madhyam se relies kii jaae
 But the High Court found that people are having more difficulty in getting pension through MLA
 hoicourt ne apane aadesh main kaha ki pehle ke mukaable ab zyada pareshaani he, isliye dilli sarkaar ko portal ko hi behatar karne ke prayaas karne chahie
 The High Court suggested that the portal should also be open in auto mode
 jisase agar kisi benifishari kii mrityu ho jaae to portal main applai karne kaa spes khud ban jaae
 This will also remove political interference and the person applying will not have to wait much
 darasal, dilli sarkaar ne vidhwaa or bujurgon ko aasaani se pension uplabdh karaane ke liye aadhaar kii anivaaryta ko khatm karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The government was of the view that people were facing problems due to the imperative of Aadhaar card
 lekin dilli sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf dilli hai court main ek janhit yachika daakhil kii gai
 The petition challenged the government's decision to hand over the Delhi government's sole authority to release the pension to the MLA
 yachika main dilli sarkaar kii door step delivery ko bhi udhaaharan ke taur par court ke saamne pesh kiya gaya
 The petitioner said that on one hand the government is claiming better facilities and solving people's problems quickly through door step delivery
 vahiin vridhon or vidhwaaon ke liye khud sarkaar pareshaani kaa sabab ban rahi he
 The High Court sought an affidavit from the Delhi Government on this and the counsel for the Delhi Government told the court under the affidavit that the decision was taken on the basis of complaints in the pension scheme
 lekin hai court sarkaar ke halafname se asantusht tha
 The court said that this is a government scheme
 aise main dilli sarkaar apane vidhayak ko aise adhikaar bhala kaise de sakati he or wo bhi pehle aao pehle paaon ke aadhaar par
 The court said that if the government has received some complaints, then it should be resolved by the Social Welfare Department
 isiilie hai court ne dilli sarkaar ke is faisle ko nirast kar diya
