 ashoka uniwarsity main raajnneeti vigyaan ke sahaayak professor mohammad khan kehete hai, ''musalamaanon ne hameshaa sthaneey muddon or ummidavaaron ke aadhaar par vot diya he na ki ek samooh ke rup main
 There is no data that supports the myth or historical pattern of the Muslim vote bank
 "kai logon kaa tark he ki muslim matadaataaon kaa voting pattern us khaas nirvachan kshetra kii raajnneeti se prerit hota he na ki muslim virdohi bayaanbaji or ghatnaon se dikhaae gaye bhay se
 Like Hindus, the issue of Muslim identity on the ground is also highly fragmented which varies with religious, linguistic, caste and class
 jahaan pichley kuch chunaavon main bhaajapa ke paksh main hindu voton kii badhati sankhya dekhi gai he
 Muslim votes are divided between the Congress and other strong regional political parties
 jin rajyon main congress, bhaajapa ke saath sidhe mukaable main he, vahaan use baari sankhya main muslim mat milte hai
 In other states where there are strong regional parties — UP, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and Delhi — Muslim support for the Congress has decreased significantly and Muslim vote has shifted to the strongest regional party in that region
 has gone

 Many incidents of lynchings on cow slaughter, ban on beef trade and consumption, things like homecoming and love jihad, and bitter statements from political leaders like UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who tried to turn the electoral battle towards Ali and Bajrang Bali That, most of these Muslims have started feeling isolated and this is being seen for the first time

 They will probably vote for the party or candidate who can defeat the BJP in that region
 "lekin musalamaanon ke saamne badi duvidha yah rahati he ki unhen aisi koi party nahin dikhti jo unki chintaaon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sake
 a competition has begun between large political parties to woo Hindu votes
 agar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne khud ko janeudhari shivbhakt ghoshit kiya he or 2015 main saarvajanik rup se ek mandir se duusare mandir ke chakkar katate rahe hai, to sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne bhaajapa ke ram mandir kii bayaanbaji par pratikriya dete hue vaada kiya he ki ve apane kshetra itawa main ek vishaal vishnu mandir banavaakar vishnu nagar basaayenge

 "ise 'dharmanirpeksh dalon' kii 'muslim tushtikaran' kii raajnneeti karne ke aresas-bhaajapa ke aaropon kii sidhi pratikriya ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 This has helped BJP consolidate the Hindu vote and jeopardize the majority Hindu votes for other parties
 varnears kehete hai, ''bhaajapa dhruvikaran main maahir he or anya dal uske fande main funs gaye hai
 That is why the Congress openly stated that it needs to dispel the notion that it is pro-muslim
 " lekin muslim netaa is sthiti ko paidaa karne ke liye congress ko samaan rup se jimmedaar maanate hai
 "when Shivraj Patil was the Home Minister during the UPA rule, there were several explosions and the government blamed Huji and Simi," says Madani
 bahut se musalamaanon ko hiraasat main liya gaya, kadi poochtacha kii gai or aisi dharna bani ki musalmaan aatankwaadi hai
 In the last 60 years, the Congress has done the most damaging work against Muslims
 "adhikansh vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki musalamaanon kii maujuuda dayaneey saamaajik-aarthik sthiti unke muddon ke prati rajnatik varg kii nirantar udaseenta kaa parinaam he
 "the so-called Muslim political elite, who claimed to represent the so-called secular parties and the community, deliberately exaggerated the point of identity-based oppression and The real troubles of Muslims disappeared
 kisi bhi anya samudaay kii tarah musalmaan bhi garibi, rojgaar or shiksha ko lekar zyada chintit hai
 The danger associated with religious identity affects them psychologically, but it does not fully determine their aspirations as a citizen
 "muslim netaa kahaan hai?2012 main, muslim yuvaaon ke ek samooh ke saath baatcheet main rahul gandhi ne poocha ki muslim samudaay se bharat ke pehle shiksha mantri, moulana abul kalam aaazaad ke kad kaa netritv doosraa kyon nahin ubhar sakaa? rajnatik paryvekshakon kaa maananaa he ki is sawaal kaa jawaab talasha jaae to is naakaami kii badi jimmedaari unki party ke khate main bhi aegi
 Says Verniers, "since partition, there has been a lack of oligarchy among Muslims as most of them migrated to Pakistan
" do anya karkon ne is samasya ko or badhaayaa
 The Congress, which dominated the post-independence electoral scenario, wanted Muslim votes but was not ready to give them adequate representation
 yah pravriti kai dashakon tak chali
 "all india-majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi agrees:" a leader can neither suddenly drop from the sky nor tear off the ground, he has to emerge
 rajnatik dal musalamaanon ko jagah or tikat dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 So how can Muslim leaders having influence all over India emerge? ”since independence, Indian Muslims have supported secular parties like Congress, SP, BSP, Trinamool and RJD
 ye partiyaan khud ko musalamaanon kii hitaishi to bataati hai lekin jab baat unhen aabaadi ke anupaat main pratinidhitiv dene kii aati he, to ve peeche rah jaati hai
 Muslim representation in Parliament was 2–7 percent in the Congress-dominated years of 1952–1977
 1980 main yah badhkar 10 pratishat hua jo ab tak kaa iskaa sabase ooncha str he
 Nevertheless it was lower in proportion to the total percentage of population of Muslims
 upi main vidhansabha main muslim pratinidhitiv sapa kii aguwai main 2012 main sarvocch strakru17
 1 percent, but also less than the total share of their population
 bihar main jahaan zyaadaatar congress, janata dal (united) or rajd kaa shashan rahaa, 1985 main sabase zyada muslim pratinidhitiv 10

 But these parties are limited to a particular area
 eiemiem muslim muddon ke bare main sabase mukhar dikhne kii koshish karti he or maharashtra, upi or bihar main apni jaden jamaane kii kii koshishen bhi karti rahi he, lekin ab bhi yah maatr hyderabad aadhaarit party bani hui he
 a number of Muslim parties were born after 2008 (see box) which further led to a further split in Muslim votes
 muslim netaaon ko lekar bhi asantosh he kyonki ve samudaay ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bane vaastavik muddon ko ujagar karne main vifal rahe
 Naved Hamid, president of All India Muslim majlis-e-mashawarat, an organization of 16 Muslim organizations, says, "muslim leaders in different parties are not representative of Muslims because they would often kneel before the party line instead of raising the concern of Muslims
" Huh
 "haalanki ve spasht rup se kehete hai ki ve muslim netaa nahin hai lekin ovaisi aaj muslim raajnneeti main sabase bade sitare ke rup main ubhare hai
 He and his party are now struggling to get on their feet

 Owaisi, who is gradually attracting young and progressive Muslims, says, "I am working with Prakash Ambedkar because Muslims have the same issues that Dalits have to face
" loktantr main yah acha he ki haashie par khadey paksh saath aa jaaen or dhur dakshinpanthi raajnneeti karne vaale or hamaare saath bhedbhaav karne waalon ke khilaaf ekajute ho jaaen
 "muslims and BJP In 2014, the BJP came to power but did not have a single elected Muslim MP
 party ne upi kii—aisa rajya jahaan kii 20 fisadi aabaadi muslim he—kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 siten jeetin vah bhi kisi muslim ummidavaar ko maidan main utaare bina; anya partiyon ke 55 muslim pratyaashiyon main se koi nahin jeeta
 The BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, yet it won 325 out of 403 seats
 dilachasp baat yah he ki musalamaanon kii golbandi yaa musalamaanon ke ekajute hone jaisi baaten bhaajapa ko hi apratyaksh rup se phayda pahunchaati hai
 a study by Praveen Chakraborty, head of the Congress data cell, shows that the bjp's vote share is actually higher in districts where the Muslim population exceeds the average Muslim population in that state (1
5 times or more than the average) Huh
 vot share main antar chunaavon ko swing karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Deoband, where about 34 percent of the population is Muslim, is a better example of this
 bhaajapa ke hindu ummidavaar brijesh singh ne 2017 main 46 fisadi vot share ke saath jeet hasil kii, jabaki sapa or basapa ke muslim ummidavaaron ko kramshah 31 fisadi or 24 fisadi vot mili
 BJP leaders feel that the bsp's aggressive campaign for Muslim support may eventually help his party
 bhaajapa netaa shajia ilmi kahati hai, ''musalamaanon se sidhe apni partiyon ko vot dene kii apil karke, bade vipakshi netaa samudaay kaa nuksaan kar rahe hai
 This makes majority Hindu voters feel that minority appeasement will continue in the name of secularism
 isliye ve nishchit rup se bhaajapa ko hi vot denge
 "although the BJP may not be the party of choice for most Muslims, in 2014 one out of every 10 votes was from the Muslim community
 party ko ummid he ki uski kalyankari yojanaon or teen talaak jaise saamaajik muddon ke kaaran pehle se adhik muslim mahilaon kaa samarthan milegaa
 Ilmi asks, "can anyone say that the benefits of many welfare schemes of the Modi government are not reaching the Muslims?" There are many myths about the voting behavior of Indian Muslims
 jais, unki pasand par maulaviyon kaa bahut zyada prabhaav rahata he or ve matdaan ke dauraan dharmik muddon ke bare main adhik chintit hote hai
 This year too, about 700 Ulema representing various sects have asked Muslim voters to vote for "secular parties" to defeat the BJP
 haalanki, gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke yug main is tarah kii raajnneeti ne apana mahatv kho diya kyonki muslim netaaon ke liye kshetra aadhaarit muslim chunavi raay ko samajhnaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Various studies also indicate that although Muslims accept the Ulema's opinion in matters of religion, but when it comes to political decisions, they consider the Ulema's interference in it unreasonable
 2015 ke siesds adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki 43 pratishat musalamaanon ko lagata he ki dharmik netaaon ko raajnneeti main dakhal dene se bachanaa chahie or unhen kisi khaas rajnatik dal kaa samarthan karne kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 Sensing this change, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Imam of Delhi's Jama Masjid, known for his electoral edicts, has decided not to support any political party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sansad main teen talaak mudde par hui bahes ne yah bhi dikhaaya ki kaise 'dharmanirpekshya rajnatik dalon ne rajnatik rup se apni-apni sthiti majboot rakhane ke liye khud ko isse dur karnaa shuru kar diya
 Owaisi says that Congress did not allow its Muslim member to speak on the subject in Parliament
 ve kehete hai, ''disambar 2017 main pehali bahes ke dauraan, 23 muslim saansadon main se keval chaar ne is par baat kii
 The late Maulana Mohammad Asrarul Haq Qasmi, a Farig scholar from Deoband and president of the All India Milli Council, was a Congress MP

 "haalanki, yah utsahjanak he ki sansad or vidhansabhaon main kam pratinidhitiv hone se muslim matadaata jo ki chunavi prakriya main hinduon se zyada sakriyata dikhaate hai, ve vichlit nahin hai
 "the communal violence and tension of the 90s did not give rise to bigotry among Indian Muslims," says Vanires, increasing their participation in the electoral process as voters and candidates
 " 2019 main, bhartiya muslim bhi apni chintaaon or pidaa ko apane vot ke rup main vyakt karne ke liye qamar kas rahe hai

 Sourav Ganguly said, 'I am of the opinion that players should play as many opportunities as they can without worrying about fatigue
 unhen alabatta tarotaaja rahane ke tareeke talashne honge, lekin nahin khelnaa koi hal nahin he
 "sourav Ganguly said," There are not many opportunities to play and as many as possible, we should make maximum use of them

 When asked if the Indian team relies too heavily on Virat Kohli, Sourav Ganguly replied in 'no'

 JNU ko milegaa best uniwarsity kaa awordsdarasal kareeb 2 maheene pehle jeenyu prashasan ne chaatro ko freedom squaire par anshan or pradarshan nahin karne kii chetavanee dene ke liye jo soochna board lagaaya tha us par jeenyu ke chaatro ne bhi ek poster chipka diya, jisamen jeenyu visi, register or rector ko chunauti dete hue likhaa kii vidroh or virodh kaa har wo tarika apanaaya ja sakegaa jisase jeenyu ko bachaaya ja sake
 More than 30 hours have passed but JNU students are standing on the Admin block
 shuukravaar ko jeenyu ke chaatro ne admin block main kisi ko bhi entry nahin diya

 But despite this, the students decided to stay at the JNU Admin Gate
 jeenyu ke em e second year ke chaatr dushyant kumaar ne kaha ki ujisi ke is notificesh kaa asar unki aage kii padhai par padegaa
 In fact, Dushyant wants to recruit from jnu's Social Science Department, but if the UGC 2016 notification gets implemented then admission will become difficult due to the reduced seats for the Richters
 dushyant kii tarah kriti bhi is notification se naakhush hai
 According to Kriti, JNU has received the Visitors Award and there is no better university than JNU for research in social sciences
 aise main koi kyon jeenyu se baahar janaa chahega
 UGC should increase or not decrease seats in JNU
 agar baahar kii duusari uniwarsity main koi jayega bhi to unki moti fees chukaana chaatro ke liye mushkil hoga
 Every gate of jnu's Admin block was surrounded by students
 kahi dhapli or binar poster ke saath chaatr baithe hue the, to kahin unheen gamalon kaa istemaal kar get ko block kiya gaya tha jiskaa istemaal kuch din pehle jeenyu prashasan ne chaatro ke virodh pradarshan ko band karne ke liye freedom squaire par kiya tha

 mamata banerjee ke purv vishwasaneey sahyogimukul raine un par nirankush hone kaa aarope lagaakar bhaajapa kaa rukh kar liya he
 Refuting her allegations, Trinamool Congress general secretary and education minister Chatterjee said Rai had cheated the party
 romita dattane donon netaaon se baat kii
 Here is a brief excerpt: What happened? There are several reasons why your relationship with Mamata deteriorated - dynastic politics, my decision to cooperate with the CBI to expose the Saradha scam
 lekin sabase aakhri kaaran tha, party kaa congress or makapa ke saath jane kaa faisla
 In 1997, the Trinamool Congress was formed because the Congress was not ready to clash with the Left parties
 agar congress se alag hone kaa yahi kaaran tha, to phir aisa kya hua ki ham congress or apane kattar dushman makapa ke saath gathjod karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 This was not good for the party
 kya aapane mamata se is vishay par charchaa kii thi?trinmul congress main baatcheet ke liye koi gunjaaish nahin he
 Only one person walks there - from the selection of candidates to our stand in Parliament
 aisa ek bhi mauka nahin aayaa, jab ham party adhyaksh (mamata) se alag koi faisla le sakate the
 You are leaving the Trinamool to not be right in itself, but joining the BJP? a few months after the formation of the Trinamool Congress, Mamata herself said that the BJP is not "untouchable"
 trinmul congress or bhaajapa ne 1998, 1999 or 2002 se 2006 ke bich siton ko saajha kiya tha
 We fought the 1999 Lok Sabha election as an NDA ally
 mamata atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main rail mantri bani thim
 We returned to the NDA coalition again for a few years after parting ways with the BJP after the Bangaru Laxman case (2001)
 mujhe khud ko uchit tehraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Without the support of the BJP, the Trinamool Congress would not have made a grand start
 ve aapako avasarwaadi bataa rahe hai, kah rahe hai ki aapane sibiai se bachane ke liye bhaajapa se sauda kar liya?idi ne upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main 2013 main sharada ghotaale kii jaanch shuru kii or congress ne hi sibiai jaanch kii maang kii thi
 i felt that the investigation should find out the truth, because thousands of poor people were cheated in it
 main chaahe kisi bhi party main rahun, main jaanch main sahyog karuunga
 The Trinamool (leaders) thought that by implicating me in this, they can wash their hands from the Saradha scam
 lekin main isse bedaag nikal gaya, lekin ve nahin nikal paae
 How did the BJP agree to include you even after being a key accused in the Saradha and Narada scams? i proved my innocence
 sibiai ne mujhe sirf ek baar 30 janvari, 2015 ko bulaayaa tha
 The agency had no reason to follow me
 main bhaajapa ke voton main do fisadi kaa oochaal dekh saktaa hum, jiske kaaran trinmul congress 2019 main kai siten haar jaaegi
 The BJP can win 12 seats in the Lok Sabha
 jamini str par chijen badal rahi hai
 How would you explain to the voters, especially the minority community, who have always known you as a secular leader? a large section of minorities are angry
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki usne muslimon ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he, par dikhataa kuch bhi nahin
 There is intense polarization between Muslims, those who have benefited and those who have been denied benefits
 pehali baar bengal ke chunaav main dhruvikaran hoga or bhaajapa ise sunishchit karke apana vot share badhayegi
 Minorities are not effective in 136 out of 294 assembly constituencies
 jahaan ve prabhavi hai, vahaan ve asantosh kii vajah se bante hue hai
 i predict that the Trinamool Congress' minority votes will fall by four per cent
 lekin brands mamata ab bhi vishaal bahumat ke bich sammanit hai?indira gandhi bhi 1977 main brands thim
 Such branding has no importance in politics
 varsh 2016 main 100 siton par trinmul congress kii jeet kaa antar maatr 5,000-15,000 vot tha or bhaajapa ko 15,000-20,000 vot mili the
 If those votes went to the Congress and the Left alliance, the story would be different
 aap maanate hai ki trinmul congress main vanshavaadi raajnneeti he, kya aap mamata ke bhattije ke bare main sanket kar rahe hai?main ek baar phir kahata hum ki jin logon ne trinmul congress ke mahaan andolanon (nanoor, sachhapur, singoor, nandigram, netai) main hissaa nahin liya, unke paas netritv ke liye koi anubhav, yogyata yaa vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Sadly, blood is thicker than water
 lekin vanshavaad kisi ko netaa nahin banaata he
 Even after 18 years, Rahul Gandhi is being prepared
 kya mamata ke saath talmail kii sambhaavna bachi he?nahin
 We have reached a point where it cannot be returned
 unhone mujh par najar rakhane ke liye apane prashasan ko laga diya he
 My phone is being tapped neshnal register of citijan (enarasi) ko lekar raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 When the Trinamool Congress has served a notice of adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha against the NRC draft, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy says those who are not Indian citizens should be sent out
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke netaa manoj jha neenarasi par jari kiye gaye droftpar kaha ki pichley 5 dashak se jo log rahe hai vahiin unka saboot he or ab ve is desh ke naagarik nahin rahe
 The government should be sensitive, all this is being done for political gains
 is prakaran par bijepi ke netaa subramanyam swami ne kaha, 'jo bhartiya nahin hai unhen baahar bhej diya janaa chahie, ham koi dharmashala nahin he
 On the matter, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the JNRC list has been released today, it is just the draft and is not the final list
 har kisi ko iske khilaaf kanoon ke tahat shikaayat yaa aapatti karne kaa adhikaar he
 Everyone's doubts should be resolved
 assam congress ke adhyaksh or rajyasabha saansad ripun bora kaa kahana he ki bijepi kii ore se dharmik str par dhruvikaran karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 a large number of Muslims, Nepalese Gorkhas and even Hindus will be affected
 duusari ore, shivasena saansad arvind saavant ne kaha ki jin logon kaa naam enarasi list main nahin he, unhen bharat se baahar kar diya janaa chahie
 The Election Commission is also to blame for this
 bangladeshiyon ko baahar kiya janaa chahie
 This is an eye-opening situation for the government
 aisa hi survey maharashtra or desh ke anya hisson main bhi karaayaa janaa chahie
 On the NRC report, Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that it should not affect any Indian citizen
 ham assam sarkaar kii pahal ko dhanyavad dete hai jisane desh main pehali baar is tarah kaa kadam uthaaya
 All political parties should unite support for the intruder
 duniya kaa koun sa desh hoga jo ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf aawaaj nahin uthayega
 The Congress is responsible for this, which sinned in the greed of the vote
 grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ne is par kaha ki is report kaa raajnneetikaran nahin kiya janaa chahie
 All this is being done under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 yah final list nahin he jinka naam chhot gaya he unhen apni baat rakhane ke liye mauka milegaa
 Earlier on Monday, the second list of National Register of Citizens (NRC) was released at 10 am and in this new list more than 40 lakh people have been considered as illegal citizens
 haalanki inke paas list main aap naam shaamil karwaane or naagarikta hasil karne kaa mauka he
 According to the draft issued on NRC, 2 crore 89 lakh 83 thousand 677 people have been considered as legitimate citizens
 vaid naagarikta ke liye 3,29,91,384 logon ne aavedan kiya tha, jisamen 40,07,707 logon ko avaidh mana gaya

 On 4 December 1971, the Indian Navy started Operation Trident against Pakistan and on its success, Naval Day is celebrated on this day every year
 darasal, 1971 kii jang kii shuruyaat 3 disambar se hui thi, jab pakistan ne hamaare hawaii kshetra or simavarti kshetra main hamalaa kiya tha
 The Navy carried out this operation to respond to the Pakistani

 Saif Ali Khan is one of the finest actors of Bollywood
 omkara, bing sirus, dil chahta he, res, res 2, cocktail, ham tum jaisi kai hit filmein dene vaala ye actor bollywood kaa safal actor mana jaataa he
 But his previous release of around 8 films has not shown anything special at the box office
 unki aakhri hit film res 2 thi jo ki saal 2013 main relies hui thi
 After this long hiatus, Saif is now in discussions and this is because of the show Sacred games which went on air on Netflix
 in 5 vajahon se dekhi ja sakati he saf or navaj kii 'secred games'saf indinon web siries secred games main sartaaj singh naam ke ek eemaandaar police officer ke kirdaar main najar aa rahe hai
 Saif is once again entertaining the audience in the Sikh look
 isse pehle saf kaa ye avatar film lav aajkal main najar aayaa tha
 Sacred Games is an interesting story about a gangster made in 8 episodes and the characters that surround him
 isaki kahani ko vikram chandra ke best sailing noval se adopt kiya gaya, lekin kai badlaav ke saath
 What is the story of Sacred Games: The story of this series revolves around Sartaj Singh
 vah mumbai police kaa ek afasar he, jo apradhi ganesh gayatonde se ladata he
 Ganesh considers himself to be God
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki kis tarah ye afasar ek nami apradhi se ladata he
 Serious, which is being released on the web platform, has emerged as a new entertainment medium
 manoranjan kaa ye nayaa jariya filmon se lekar televijan kii duniya ko bhi jabardast takkar detaa najar aa rahaa he
 The interest of viewers on the web platform is increasing day by day
 shaayad isi vajah se secred games, last stories or kai web siries charchaa main he
 There is no doubt that the audience is liking the character of Saif's Sikh police officer
 saf kaa kirdaar eemaandaaree ke liye nahin balki is police afasar kii uljhan bhari jindagi ke liye zyada pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 An officer who chews sleeping pills all day like chewing gum
 junglee suar ke shikaar maamle main saf ali khan kaa naam, agent giraftarecred games hit ho rahi he isliye saf kaa web siries main kaam karne kaa kadam unke damadol kariyar ko ek nai disha de saktaa he
 After this series, Saif is expected to offer films with good content
 aarthik vikaas dar pichhali paanch timahiyon se dhalaan par he, kor sector or audyogic utpaadan ke taaja aankade aage bhi giravat ke sanket de rahe hai, korporate tex main mili raahat se companiyon ke munaafe bhale bad gaye hon lekin khapat ghatane kichintaa car se biscuit tak sabhi companiyon ko sata rahi he, karj sasta hone ke baad bhicredit growth nakaaratmak he or nijee nivesh badhane ke asaar abhi najar nahin aa rahe
 Despite this extremely negative economic environment, the stock market is at a height
 aaj ke iconomicum main baat ipio bazaar par
 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) KIPO, which came recently, has rewarded investors
 100 fisadi se zyada premium par soochibaddh hue is share ne teen maheene main bhi paise teen gune par die
 At a time when companies are unable to muster the courage to bring ipos to the market, the success of an IPO of a state-run company makes many gestures
 ·demart ke baad iarsitisi ke ipio kii safalataa yah bataati he ki achche cash inflo vaali companiyaan abhi bhi niveshkon kii pehali pasand hai
 In the last decade, the appearance of the economy has changed in many ways, but companies are not getting the investment which we are using most of our lives
 america ke bazaar main fasebuk, twitor, google isliye bada munafa kama raheen, kyonki bazaar main sahi samay par puunji jutaney ke liye bazaar main ain or niveshkon ne arthvyavastha ke badalte paridrishy main nivesh kii companiyaan bhi badali
 But this is not the case in the Indian market
 ola – ubar ko ham auto industry main krantikari badlaav ke rup main dekh rahe, lekin nivesh ke liye abhi bhi bazaar main puraani auto companiyaan hai
 Similarly, electronic goods (mobile) became the second most importable item in the country, surpassing gold, but no mobile company is available in the market for investment
 whatsap or anya soshal media plateform, jo desh main raajnneeti se lekar arthvyavastha tak dakhal rakhte hai bharatiyon kii pahunch se dur hai
 There are more such examples
 ·sebi main 37 ipio ko manjuuri di
 Some companies could not knock the market in time
 30 hajaar karod ke kareeb 30 ipio bazaar main aane ko taiyaar hai
 But it is not necessary for everyone to get similar response, for this it is necessary to have a business model and cash flow like Demart and IRCTC
 bazaar ke niamak ko bhi is disha main dhyaan dene kii jarurat he ki jo companiyaan bazaar main badi hissedari rakhti hai yaa kisi nai takanic ke bal par bazaar main krantikari badlaav laati hai to unhen bazaar se paisa jutaney ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 If a startup can bring funding to a strong business model, then why can't investors invest their capital in it
 daleel yah di ja sakati he ki chote niveshkon kii puunji ke liye bada jokhim hoga
 So where is the capital of small investors safe in the current market? Know how many companies like IL&FS, Yes Bank, Dewan Housing, Reliance Communication, the savings of investors were taken

 Highlighting the comments denying the possibility of the Prime Minister taking up the post again, the BJP leader said that the people of the country will retire the Congress in the upcoming elections
 unhone kaha ki doctor manmohan singh dwaara sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii jarurat nahin thi kyonki janata congress party ko sanyas dilaane ke bare main pehle hi faisla kar chuki he
 The message of elections in five states is clear

 gathavaala khap ke 52 gaanvon ke choudhary baba harkishan malik shamali jile ke lisadha gaanv main apni dyodhi par hukka gudaiuda rahe hai
 With him, his 60-year-old son Rajendra Malik and some villagers are leisurely discussing the Supreme Court verdict published in the March 27 newspaper
 is faisle main uttar pradesh sarkaar ko mujffarnagar dangon kii sajeesh kaa pehle se pataa na laga paane ke liye fatkaar lagaai gai he or yah bhi kaha gaya ki samaajawaadee party sarkaar kis tarah aropiyon ko pakadaaey main naakaam rahi he
 But this hookah meeting under the vine tree actually makes a mockery of the court verdict as the 84-year-old Harkishan Malik has 26 cases of rioting, including mob incitement and murder
 vahiin rajendra par hatya sahit dangon se jude teen darjan mukademe darj hai
 Rajendra himself told this thing very politely in the sweet air with the smell of fresh jaggery rising from the crusher
 mukademon kii fehrist ko jeb se nikaalte hue rajendra malik kehete hai, ''ab aap hi bataaie, jab inase chalaa-phiraa bhi nahin jaataa to baba hatya jaisaa aparaadh kaise karenge? ye to ji, voter list uthaakar ek taraf se mukademe laga die
 Nothing happened here
 '' baatcheet se saaf jaahir he ki apni giraftaar na hone ke prati ve kitne aashwast hai
 By the way, despite his innocent pleas, he cannot ignore the serious allegation that Chaudhary was a Baba of Panchayat before the riots at the Inter College in Lisadh, irrespective of his age
 or unki aankh kaa ishaara khap main aaj bhi myne rakhata he
 The second thing is that what they are saying 'nothing happened here' is recorded in the police records as 13 murders
 lekin police kii mustaidi kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki vah phugana thane se baba ke ghar ko jodgaye vaali sadak par paanch kimi kaa rasta saat maheene main bhi tay nahin kar pai he
 The condition of the laxity of the police in the arrest is that even 804 people named in the riots are still absconding in the papers, while they are sitting comfortably at their house like Baba
 haa, police ke is ravaie ne gaanv se jaan bachaakar bhaage musalamaanon kii dehshat ko or badha diya he
 Their big houses have become haunted
 unamem saamaan bikharaa padaa he or khidki-daravaaje ukhaad liye gaye hai
 In some of these houses, the villagers are now tying their own cows
 jo haal lisadha kaa he, vahi haal is panchayat ke majara hasanpur kaa he
 The 30-year-old Tayab of Hasanpur was shocked when we met him at the Muslim-dominated Jola village camp
 jaaton se byaaj par paisa lekar pheriwale kaa kaam karne vaale chaar bacchon ke pita ne kaha, ''main karnataka, andhra pradesh or maharashtra tak kapadaa bechney jaataa tha
 Often, slums were also seen in cities
 lekin kabhi sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek din ham bhi jhuggiyon main rahane ko majaboor honge
 "tayyab admits that no Muslim was killed in his village, but Lisadh has horrified those like him
" ve log ab gaanv nahin janaa chaahate, udhar sarkaar ne ab tak is gaanv ko muaavja bhi nahin diya he
 In such a situation, they are also looking for compensation like the rest of the people, so that there will be some basis to start life afresh
 vaise bhi khauf kaa saaya ab nayaa thikaana banane ko majaboor kar rahaa he
 This fear has now become a permanent identity of the riot-affected villages of western UP
 yahaan saamaajik tanabana puri tarah bikhar gaya he
 Jat dominated villages are now just Hindu villages, because Muslims have called them forever
 phugana, itawa, naala, kharad, allam, hasanpur, baavdi, hadalli, nirpuda, aap jis gaanv kaa bhi zikr kiijie, vahaan musalamaanon ke palaayan kii ek-si tasviir najar aegi
 Yes, Basi village adjacent to Shahpur would appear to be the exception
 mujffarnagar kaa yah iklauta gaanv he jahaan valmiki samudaay ke hinduon ne musalamaanon ke dar se gaanv se palaayan kiya he
 In fact, this is the village where the Jats returning to Panchayat from Muzaffarnagar were stoned by Muslims on September 7 and a Jat was killed
 uske baad daliton ko is muslim bahul gaanv main rahanaa surakshit nahin laga
 Since then, 28 Valmiki families of the village have been living in the Gandhinagar locality of Muzaffarnagar
 apane chaar bacchon ke saath yahaan rah raheen babitha valmiki kahati hai, ''ham log to chaati tak bhare johad ko parkar bacchon ko bachaakar kisi tarah yahaan laae hai
 There is a lot of danger there
 '' chhathvin main padhgaye vaale unke bete aman kaa skool bhi tabhi se chhot gaya he
 And the slum in which they are living here is also in danger of being desolated night and day
 gaanv ke ravi valmiki halaat se uktakar kehete hai, ''musalamaanon ko to muaavja bhi mil gaya he, lekin hamen to phooti kaudi bhi nahin mili
 Is it a crime to be a Hindu? "but neither one is answering Taib's question nor Ravi's question, because the leaders who are in power could not give any solid help to them in seven months and those who are in opposition, they engaged in this crime They will benefit or harm from the riots
 isiilie danga peediton ke gharon ko rahane laayak banane ke liye koi pahal bhale hi na hui ho, lekin unhen voter banaae rakhane ke liye nae voter card dene main der nahin ho rahi he
 The names of the Muslims living in Jola and Loi camps have been recorded in the voter lists along with the addresses of the refugee camps and soon they will be voters of these areas, even if they are from a village
 voter list vahaan bhi taiyaar ho rahi he, jahaan logon ko kisi tarah ashiana mil gaya he
 a new settlement is situated near Sarai village under the name Sheikhulhind
 yahaan jamiyat ulema-e-hind ne musalamaanon ke liye 55 ghar banaakar die hai
 Shajid of Jola Camp said, "CPM is also being built for us in front of the village
 ''aisa nahin he ki rajnatik dal sirf voter list kii phikr kar rahe hai
 He is equally worried about pulling the voter in his court
 tabhi to november main loi camp ko jabaran ujaadeye kii pahal karne vaali akhilesh yadav sarkaar kii sapa ke hi jhande ab is camp par laharaate dikh rahe hai
 The SP is hoping that the bsp's muslim-dalit equation is broken after the riots
 aise main bispi ke kaadir rana ko dobaaraa saansad banane main dikkat pesh aa sakati he
 On the other hand, with the small banners of 'ab ki Bar, Modi Sarkar', the BJP is also showing its presence in the riot affected villages
 vaise chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se pehle puraa ilaaka narendra modi ke bhavy bannron se pata tha, lekin samhita kii majaburi main party ko chote bannron se santosh karnaa pad rahaa he
 Yet the BJP does not want to miss out on the polarization feast ripe in the heat of the riots
 party ne dangon ke aaropee sanjeev baalion ko mujffarnagar or hukum singh ko kairana se tikat diya he
 It is clear that these new equations are also presenting a challenge to the Jat-dominated Ajit Singh's National Lok Dal
 is nae maahaul ke peshey-najar siyasat aisi paheli ban gai he, jisamen sarkaar ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki aropiyon par sakhti karne main phayda he yaa maamle ko thande baste main daalkar bhul jane main
 That is why the victims of the riots are getting killed, the main accused are resting and the government is being reprimanded in the court
 kolkata ke rigwaan ur rahamaan kii khudakushi ke maamle main mukhya aaropee ashok todi kii yachika par aaj supreme court main sunwaayee hogi

 Earlier, three other accused in the case appeared in a Kolkata court yesterday

 Their lawyers appealed to the court to extend the bail period by one month

 After this, the court ordered them to appear on December 12

 There were rubbish on the face
 bal kaale or chaal javaanon vaali thi
 But now news is being received from the jail that Baba has despair in his eyes

 At the same time, the path is being raised for people coming to the rally from all sides, on which people will not have to go into the water

 singh ne kaha ki unhone ek samay osama bin laden kaa samarthan kiya tha, jabaki 2004 ke chunaavon main bijepi ke paksh main fatwa jari kiya tha
 Speaking to reporters, Singh said, "we are as much against the reclusive Muslims as the reclusive Hindus
" 
 
 congress hameshaa udaaravaadi hinduon or musalamaano ko saath lekar aage badi he
 He took a jibe when Bukhari came with the SP and said that Kalyan Singh used to ride the sp's bicycle, now Imam Bukhari has been replaced in his place
 isse purv baharich main singh ne kaha ki bukhari kaa prabhaav itnaa he ki dilli kii jis jama masjid main vah imam hai or varshon se vahaan rahete aae hai, usee ilaake se unka virdohi chunaav jitkar aa jaataa he

 unhone bukhari ke sapa ke saath aane par chutki lete hue kaha ki pehle sapa kii cycle par kalyaan singh savaar the, ab unki jagah imam bukhari savaar ho gaye hai
 Earlier in Bahraich, Singh said that Bukhari's influence is such that his opponent comes from the same area in Delhi's Jama Masjid where he is an Imam and has lived there for years
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main unhone yoga guru baba ramdev ko frod kaha
 On the question related to the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya, Congress leader Singh said that the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao had made a mistake that he had trusted Kalyan Singh's affidavit

 Special coverage on captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni is to be announced today but the captain is asking for rest? Captain Saheb may not be tired while playing in the Champions League, but if he wants to play for the country, then rest is needed
 khabar aa rahi he ki angrejon ke bharat daure ke dauraan aaraam karnaa chaahate hai
 And he has told this to the selectors a day before the team selection
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye clic karankptain kii is maang ne chayankartaaon ko asamanjas main daal diya he
 If Dhoni is given rest, then how will he make a team to take the iron from England
 us sthiti main jab sachin, sahvaag or yuvaraj jaise diggajon ke bhi chot kii vajah se khilne par duvidha bani hui he
 So the selectors have the option that they can give Dhoni rest in the first two games
 agar isapar rajamandi nahin banati to phir aakhri do maichon main unhen aaraam diya ja saktaa he
 If he really likes Dhoni's argument more then he can give him rest for the whole series
 aaraam ke saath ye sawaal isliye kaaphi bada he ki dhoni chaahate to champions lig chhodkar aaraam kar sakate the
 But instead of playing for the country, they find it more important to play the Champions League
 sawaal uthta he ki desh bada yaa paisa
 Only the captain can answer

 This time there was a program to go to Himachal during the holidays
 main train se safar karne main vishwaas karata hum isliye dilli se kalka tak kaa safar shatabdi se kiya phir aage bhi train se janaa tha wo bhi toy train se
 The toy train was because there was a desire to travel in it too and the daughter was very excited
 toy train nairo gej par chalati he
 There are 4 to 5 compartments, it runs very slowly and goes through a tunnel every 2-3 minutes
 log khaas kar bachche us vakt kaaphi utsaah main chillaate hai
 It takes 6 hours to reach Shimla from Kalka
 ham jis train main gaye the vah saadhaaran train thi magar isamen sofe vaali train bhi he
 You can also book the entire box if you want
 kuch train main pantry car bhi he jisamen aap ke pasand kaa khaanaa mil saktaa he
 Everyone has different timings, you can choose the train as per your convenience
 is train ko antarrashtriya dharohar main shaamil kiya gaya he
 While sitting in the train i was wondering how the British would have laid this track
 ham isaki dekhbhaal kar sake to hi ham apane aane vaale pidiyon ko bhi is train par chadhane or romaanchak safar kaa majaa lene de sakate hai
 In the train, TT Babu told that i should bring one of his problems to the officials at Rail Bhavan
 titi babu kaa kahana tha ki is train main 5 dabbe hai jo aapas main jude nahin hai jisaki vajah se titi ko tikat check karne main dikkat hoti he
 They have to get down at every station in a box and in checking the entire train, the train reaches Shimla and taking advantage of this, people get down at the station and climb into another compartment
 khayr 3 ghante ke romaanchak safar ke baad ham condaghat pahunch gaye jahaan se chail najadik he
 But upon reaching Sadhupul from Kanda Ghat, it was found that the bridge had been broken
 darasal 100 saal is puraane pul par teen trek sebon se bhare hue rasta bhatakate hue sadhupul pahunch gaye
 The three trucks climbed the bridge
 purana pul teen trakon kaa bhaar sahan na kar sakaa or bharbhara kar baith gaya
 Now the river had to be crossed through a diversion
 ek tikhi utraai ke baad jo kaaphi khatarnaak tha, ham aswin nadi ke saamne the
 There was not much water in the river only the ankles would be slightly up, so crossing the river was easy
 ab yahi rasta he chail tak jane kaa, yahi vajah he ki yah ek tourist point ban gaya he
 There is a chair table in the river itself, you can enjoy sitting in the water between the river and things like tea pakoras, maggi
 main chail se 7 kilometre pehle hi ek resort main rukaa tha
 This place is on the side of the road, but due to the break of the bridge, there is little traffic
 ekadam shant jagah he, kamare main bade-bade shishe lage hai, parade uthaaie palang par lete hue pahaad, jangal or badal ko nihaar sakate hai
 While we were there, it continued to rain every day, frost in the weather, fire was lit in the room at night
 dilli kii bhagdaud or trephic sahan karne ke baad yah jagah jananath se kam nahin maaloom ho rahi thi
 Chail is a small place, the driver said that the ATM is also open 6 months ago
 driver ke kehane par ham khaanaa khaane sonu ke dhabas par gaye, dil main ye bhi tha ki driveron kii dhabon se setting hoti he magar jab vahaan pahunche to dekha ki yah dhaba keval mahilaayein hi sambhalati hai or yahaan tave vaali roti hi milti he
 What to say about food Masha Allah, the taste of Dal Makhani, Kadhi and Paneer
 jab main paisa dene gaya or mahila ko bolaa ki driver kaa bhi khaane kaa bill le len to usne kaha ki driver ne khud chukaa diya he
 Then i was shocked and remembered that we are in Himachal and honesty is left here
 ek din ke liye shimla bhi gaye, chail se 2 se dhai ghante lagate hai
 The road to Shimla is smooth and there is plenty of traffic and traffic starts 10 km from Shimla
 kisi tarah lift se mal tak pahunche to laga lajpat nagar yaa karolbaag main aa gaye hai
 You will find all the major brand stores in the world on the mall
 khaanaa khaane ke liye ham coffee house pahunche jo khachaakhach bharaa tha
 Dosa ate, drank coffee and set out for Chail
 resort main uske maalik se mulaakaat hui
 i wanted to know how he felt about doing business here
 unhone bataaya ki yah kaaphi shant jagah he, aaj tak unhone na police yaa kisi anya adhikari ko ek paise kii rishwat di he
 People are honest
 hotel main guest mobile aksar bhul jate hai to staff use resepshan par jamaa kara detaa he
 They said that we have returned many mobiles
 ant main ek or ghatana kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 When we came back to Kalka, we called the same driver who was driving us to Chail and Shimla
 chail se kalka 62 kilometre he, dhai teen ghante lagate hi hai kyonki solan main gyani ji ke dhabas ko koi miss nahin karnaa chahta
 When we reached Kalka, we asked the driver how much money he said for 2000 rupees
 mujhe laga ki shaayad kam paisa le rahaa he kyonki use 60 kilometre vaapis bhi janaa he
 When i started giving him some more money, he folded his hands
 main soch rahaa tha ki kaisaa aadmi he magar thodi jid ke baad usne paise le liye magar hamen stesan tak saamaan ke saath chhod gaya
 Also left 1 is a feeling for our whole family, which you can only expect from people from small places like Chail
 milte hai aise log jo apni saadagi or eemaandaaree se aapako chota hone kaa ahsaas kara dete hai
 The phone hacking controversy in Britain took a new turn when Sean Hoer, who was the journalist of the closed 'news of the World', was found dead

 bollywood abhinayta salmaan khan kaa kahana he ki vah sirf un utpaadon ke liye prachaar karte hai jinka vah khud istemaal karte hai
 The comments salmaan ko antarrashtriya vigyaapan sangh ke pehle brands endorser of da year award se sammanit kiya gaya he
 "I only promote products that i use myself," Salman said at the IAA Leadership Awards ceremony on Saturday evening
 ’ salmaan ne kai utpaadon ke liye prachaar kiya he
 He is also the brand ambassador of several companies
 unhone kaha, ‘jab main kisi utpaada ke liye prachaar karata hum to uskaa matlab he ki aap ise pahanie, istemaal kiijie yaa khaaie
 If i do not use a product, i do not even promote it
 ’ Salman has been awarded the International Advertising Association's first brand endorser of the year award
 salmaan ne shanivaar shaam ko iee leadership award samaaroh main kaha, ‘‘main sirf un utpaadon kaa prachaar karata hum jinka khud istemaal karata hum
 Salman has campaigned for many products
 saath hi vah kai companiyon ke brands ambassador bhi hai
 He said, 'when i promote a product, it means that you wear it, use it or eat it
 yadi main kisi utpaada kaa istemaal nahin karata hum, to uske liye prachaar bhi nahin karata

 Earlier, Raman Lamba of India also said goodbye to his loved ones after getting injured during a cricket match
 lekin bharat ke gali-mohalle ke cricketer roj aise khataron se rou-ba-rou hote hai
 Of course, Hughes and Lamba were international players and they had everything they could to protect themselves
 lekin unke paas lack nahin tha, jisase vah khud ko bachaa sakate
 But just think of those Indian cricketers who are two to four at such risk every day
 jinke paas na to proper saamaan hota he, na hi sharir ko bachaane vaali chijen
 But it is passion and luck (as long as it works) that keeps it from playing and coping with injuries
 aisa hi hamaara bhi jamaana tha (1990 kaa dashak), cricket kii deewangi
 Every Sunday would have matches and instead of Proper Kit, only passion
 subah sabase pehle ek adad maidan kii talash
 Then compete with the opposing teams to play there and finally get the field for half-a-day when they reach an agreement
 pocket mani kaa concept hota nahin tha
 Purchased pads, baits and gloves and L-guards from the rear of the Red Fort
 ek purana helmet bhi tha jo aksar shot maarane par ankhon ke aage aa jaataa tha
 Just played many tournaments with these
 kai half centuri jamaain lekin hameshaa khatre main rahe
 If the ball hit the leg, it did not hurt for a week
 ek dost ne naakaafi helmet kii vajah se apane do daant cricket par qurbaan kar die to ek din el-guard ke baavjood lagi gend ne 10 minute ke liye jameen par hi lita diya
 Even so, but the day the ground is not available and the passion of cricket fills the hill, addiction takes us to the cricket ground of Mori Gate in Delhi or India Gate where we used to play very little
 vajah vahaan itane log ek-saath khelte ki samaj hi nahin aata koun-si gend kiski he or kab kahaan se koun-si gend aapaki canapati garm kar de
 There were many occasions that when someone started running behind someone's ball, sometimes someone else's ball warmed up
 aaj bhi is tarah ke khatre maujuud hai
 Overall we can say that we are obsessed with cricket and perhaps we play cricket in such a risky manner in which the shadow of anything happens on our head
 aise gali-mohalle ke bhartiya cricketron ko salaam jo jokhim se aage pahunch chuke hai or yahi kahenge ki phil or raman jaisaa haadasa kisi ke saath na ho

 mere liye sharmindagi kii baat yah he ki mujhe unki maut se kuch samay pehle hi unke bare main kai ahm jaankariyaan mil sakin or ab main unpar likh bhi rahaa hum
 This song of Kabootari received a lot of love in Nepal apart from migrants from Uttarakhand spread all over the world
 is geet main kuch shabd nepal se bhi aae hai or is lihaaj se yah geet puraane samay main bharat or nepal kii saajha samskruti kaa pratik bhi he
 Apart from this, in this song we also get to see the Mahakali river dividing the two countries and other natural images and the social conditions there
 kabutari ne apane lokgeeton main uttarakhand kii prakritik drushyavaliyon ko to bakhubi pesh kiya, lekin ham is lekh shrinkhalaa main yah dekhne kii koshish karenge ki unke gayan main tatkaaleen samaajik-aarthik paristhitiyon ke jwalanth prashn kis tarah se aate hai or vah apane gayan se yathasthiti ko todane kii kitni koshish karti hai? iske alaava yah prashn bhi vichaarneey he ki kabutari ke nidhan ke baad uttarakhand main lokagayan or lokkalaon kaa kya swaroop bachaa hua he or vah vaishvikaran kii chunautiyon ke saamne vah samarpan kii mudra main he yaa apni pahchaan banaate hue samay ke saath kadamtal karne ko taiyaar he
 The first part of the article is about his life struggle and creative journey
 saaj bajaane haathon se tode pattharuttrakhand kii hudakya (dalit) jati se aane vaaleen kabutari kaa jivan sangharsh uttarakhand kii aam mahilaon jaisaa hi dubhar rahaa, balki ek band samaaj or shilpkaar (dalit) jati main paidaa hone kii vajah se yah us str tak kshtprad rahaa ki ise mahasoos karnaa adhiktar ke liye bahut mushkil hoga
 The pigeons used to break stones with their hands
 hudakya (yani hudaka, damru se thodaa bada gale main latakaakar haath se bajaayaa jane vaala vaadya yantra, bajaane vaali jati) ek samay main uttarakhand main gaali ke taur par bhi istemaal hota tha kyonki savarna tabaqon main gane-bajaane or naachne ko heydrushti se dekha jaataa tha
 It will be said that the upper attitude of the upper caste is that this section kept looking at the folk art and folk art from different perspective
 uttarakhand ke daliton kii aajeevika kaa paaramparik saadhan khetihar mazdooree, pathar todna, bhawan nirmaan, krishi yantra or aujaar bananaa or rituon ke tyoharon (baras din ko pelo maina
 
 
 
 ), shaadiyon or duusare utsavon main nrity or gayan rahaa he
 Kabutari also learned singing from her parents and grandmother from the age of seven
 kam umr main hi unki shaadi divaani ram se ho gai, jo unke liye geet likhte the or vah vibhinn manchon par unhen gaati thim
 He also took them to All India Radio
 akashwani ne di pahachaanakabutari ne 1970 or 80 ke dashak main akashwani nazibabad, rampur, lakhanu or mumbai ke vibhinn bhashaa ke kaaryakramon main gayan kiya
 His singing was also broadcast from Lucknow Doordarshan Kendra
 unki darjan bhar se zyada recording ol india radio ke paas hai
 Apart from this, he also sang on many forums such as regional festivals, Ramlilaon, Uttarayani festivals, which have hardly been preserved
 pati kii mrityu ke baad unhone saamaajik jivan se duuri bana lee or vah uttarakhand ke seemaant jile- pithauragarh ke apane ghar main rahakar mazdooree karke apane parivaar ko paalane lageen
 At the Chhaliya Festival in Pithoragarh in 2002, Navodaya Hill Art Forum brought him back to the public again and in 2004 he was promoted by the editor of Uttara Patrika Dr
 uma bhatta, yugamanch, pahaad or nainital samachar ke prayaason se nainital main phir se rilaunch kiya gaya
 The second round of pigeonhole started from here
 samskruthikarmi or naatakkaar jahur alam bataate hai ki is safal kaarykram ko media ne bhi khub kawarej di or iske baad unhen desh bhar se gayan ke liye bulaayaa jane laga
 Dr
 uma bhatta, jahur alam, sanjay joshi, sanjay mattu ke prayaason se kabutari devi par ek documentary bhi taiyaar ho chuki he
 It was to be released in front of Kabutari Devi that she died prematurely
 ab ise nainital main 16 sitambar ko locarpit kiya jayega
 Malika Kabutari Devi of Begum Akhtar, Teejanbai and Kabootaribuland Awaaz did not take formal initiation of music
 jahur alam bataate hai ki vah riturain (mausam ke geet), chautee, nyoli, chapeli, dhuska ke saath hi apane andaaj main geet, ghazal or thumari bhi gaati thim
 He is also called Tejanbai of Uttarakhand or Begum Akhtar of Pahar
 uttarakhand kii loksamskruti, lokkalaon kaa adhyayan karne vaale dow
 According to Girija Pandey, Kabutari has also sung Begum Akhtar for her listeners many times
 begum akhtar or kabutari donon ko buland gale kii gayikaon ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Sanskriticist and playwright Zahoor Alam says that Kabutari Devi's lofty voice and tinkling throat as well as her khajardar voice were somewhat reminiscent of Begum Akhtar's singing
 haalanki, uttarakhand ke rangakarmi or samskruti ke adhyeta is tulana se sahamat nahin dikhte
 One reason for this may be that Teejan has sung the Pandavavani (the legend of the Mahabharata), while the singing of the kabootari consists mostly of prakriti, virah (neoli) and love songs, and the divine songs have come only occasionally
 samskruti or media ke adhyeta dow
 Bhupen Singh says that just as Teejan Bai cannot be called Chhattisgarh goddess of Chhattisgarh, it is not right to call Kabutari as Teejanbai of Uttarakhand, the media should avoid such comparisons
 vah kehete hai ki donon gayikaon ke parivesh, saamaajik paristhitiyaan or bhubhag bhinn rahe, isliye unhen inhen sandarbhon ke saath dekha janaa chahie
 Yes, Anil Karki, a rising theater artist and litterateur of Uttarakhand, has agreed to be called Begum Akhtar in the context of breaking the prevailing beliefs, though it is not right for Anil Karkar to be called Begum Akhtar after the Ghazal singing of classical singing
 
 is tulana ko vah sarleekaran kehete hai
 Anil says that Teejan and Begum tried to mold the folk into scripture, which is not found in the singing of the dove
 vah bataate hai, kabutari ke akashwani main gane se kumaunni sangeet bhi academik hua or yah mukt lok se 5-6 minute kii simaaon main bandha gaya
 Kabutari, who was conferred with a glimpse of the mountain at the President's Award for singing, did not make singing his full-time profession, perhaps because he did not get such a name
 dow
 Anil Karki says that once senior member of Kabutari Devi's singing troupe and his teacher (dalit) folk singer Bhanuram Suakoti had said that he does not sing to sell cassettes
 samajha ja saktaa he ki kabutari kaa gayan bhi bazaar se prasiddhi or kamai karne kii chahat se pare tha
 Anil says that Kabootari was ready to sing anytime, anywhere without any frills, on stage
 kabutari hormonium or hudke ke saath gaati thim
 She went to attend events with her husband
 tab pahaado tak sadaken nahin pahunchi thim or paidal hi chalaa jaataa tha
 During this time, she used to practice singing (riyaz) by memorizing songs composed by husband Deewani Ram on the way
 unke geeton main palaayan, virah, mausam, chidiya, pahaad, nadi-naule, jangal, bail-bhens, raat-din, chand-taare, ghaas ke maidan or mandiron kaa zikr dekhne ko miltaa he
 The proportion of the natural beauty of Uttarakhand in the singing of Kabutari Devi is unseen in that proportion
 aisa tab he jabaki kabutari samaaj ke bahishkrut tabake se aati hai or aise mukaam par pahunchati hai, jahaan unhen sunne ke liye har varg ke log lalayit rahete hai
 She had such a chance that she could shatter the consciousness of a closed society
 philhal unke gayan ke is pahalu par baat nahin ho saki he
 It will be our endeavor that we will discuss this in the next two parts
 kabutari devi kaa sambhavit aakhri intervyuu-(kabutari devi par yah teen lekhon kii shrinkhalaa kaa pehla hissaa he
 In the second part of this article, we have tried to know to what extent the singing of a dove that emerged as a mountain sound tried to change the circumstances of his society
 kaha ja saktaa he ki ek kalakaar se yah atirikt aagrah he, lekin jimmedaar kala kaa daayitv sirf samaaj, prakruti or paristhitiyon kaa chithran karnaa nahin hota, balki use logon ke paksh main badalane kii koshish bhi hota he

 Giving information in the Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said that in the last 3 years, the maximum number of infiltration cases in the indo-pak border has been reported 517 times in 2017
 jabaki 2016 or 2015 main kramshah 454 or 223 ghuspaith ke maamle saamne aae
 Kiren Rijiju, in his written reply, said that in 2017, 75 terrorists were killed by Indian security forces while crossing the border

 Whoever infiltrates from across the border is killed on the border itself
 jo ghuspaith kar letaa he usko kashmir ghati main oparation ke dauraan dher kar diya jaataa he
 The morale of the Indian security forces is very high at this time and will continue to conduct similar operations against the terrorists

 Headley's attorney John Theis, the prime accused in the 2008 attacks, told PTI, 'although i cannot disclose where he is, he is neither in Chicago nor in any hospital'

 As is often the case with China, it has not offered any explanation as to why it did such a thing all of a sudden, but for so many years it has been understood that China was unhappy with India's interpretation of the Line of Actual Control
 lihaaja, usne is safagoi kii prakriya ko aage badhanaa nirarthak samaj liya tha
 It was only after the visit of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to China that the border talks were resumed and what is now considered a Special Representative (SR) system on the boundary question started
 ek dashak baad esaaar samvaad kaa bhi asar jaataa rahaa he kyonki haal ke varshon main isamen koi pragati nahin ho pai he
 In fact, differences remain over the interpretation of the 2005 agreement on political standards and the guidelines to resolve the boundary dispute

 Of course, the relationship between the two countries will remain contradictory, but the political environment should be such that opportunities can be created in every field
 yah sandesh na jaae ki ek kshetra kii keemat par duusare kshetra main hi vikaas ho rahaa he
 This delicate balance has to be maintained in the talks, this will be the real test of Modi's ability
 acchhee baat yah he ki sarkaar aisi ranneeti ko aakaar detii najar aa rahi he jisase china ke saath majboot aarthik sambandh ban saken
 Dedicated industrial parks, for example, will form China's investment base in India, where the government may relax some restrictions for Chinese businessmen, including a relaxation of business visa regulations
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki isi tarah nivesh ke paribhaashit kshetra taiyaar kiye ja rahe hai
 For example, Chinese companies will be able to invest in power generation equipment but will not have a role in setting up and operating the grid
 isi tarah rail main bhi china patariyon or dibbon vagairah main to nivesh kar sakegaa lekin signal systams main nivesh kii ijaajat katai nahin hogi
 In terms of security, the government may demand bilateral talks with China on the ground that political instability and growing Islamic extremism are a threat to both countries
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki bharat ke saath-saath pakistan yatra ko bhi is daure main shaamil na kar chini raashtrapati jinping ne iske liye makul avasar uplabdh karwaae hai
 But as far as the border dispute with China is concerned, the Indian government can only take this issue from talks to confidence building measures
 is maamle main kisi faisle par pahunchane ke liye esaaar vyavastha ko nai disha di jaani chahie
 However, in the long term, the challenges of dealing with politically contradictions will arise, for which it is very important to maintain dialogue
 chaar saal pehle jab china ke raashtrapati wain jiyabaao bharat aae the to donon deshon ke pradhanmantriyon ke bich ek hotline sthapit karne par rajamandi ho gai thi
 In the next few years, China had installed a tool to this effect, but the Indian side was not ready for this
 aaj bhi hot-line chaalu nahin ho pai he
 Such issues test credibility and competence and it is here that Modi will get an opportunity to take new initiatives which he can execute with his diplomatic skills

Confirming the bifurcation by passing the Citizenship Amendment Bill and will fight against the government's agenda of ending the constitution - Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has targeted the Modi government on the Priyankarangarikaranak amendment bill

 ’’ unhone kaha ki naagariktakanoonmen aath baar sanshodhan kiya gaya he lekin jitani uttejnaa is baar he, utani kabhi nahin thi
 The reason for this is that it is against Articles 14, 15, 21, 25 and 26

 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main kisi ke saath jati, dharm ke aadhaar par vibhed nahin karne kii baat kahi gai he tab naagarikta dete samay bhedbhaav kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 The Congress MP said that from such a constitutional point of view it is not appropriate on all grounds
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan kaa moolbhoot dhaancha kahata he ki har kanoon ko panth nirpeksh hona chahie, yah vidheyak uskaa bhi ulanghan karata he

 They were run out due to this and the team's score was also affected
 ganguli ne sahvaag se kaha- aap bhram na failaayenitna sunanaa tha ki ganguli bhi atekking mood main aa gaye
 He immediately countered the talk of Virender Sehwag
 kuch der baad ganguli haath main ek parchi liye najar aa rahe the
 There were figures on that slip
 ganguli ne kaha- maine aankade nikalwaaye hai
 Sehwag you know - Meraran bitwin wicket was 36% while your 24%

 Akhilesh Sarkar has awakened after long hanging the plan for revival of the Ghats of Varanasi and is in the process of defeating Narendra Modi
 do din pehle hi kendriya paryaton mantri shripad nayak ne kaha tha ki vah varanasi ke sudhaar kii yojanaon ko pradhanmantri ke paas rakhenge
 But now the Uttar Pradesh government has started taking fast action
 ek angreji akhbaar ne khabar di he ki uttar pradesh ke chif secretary javed osmani ne shuukravaar ko shahari vikaas or shahari yojana vibhaag ke saath lambii baithak kii or vahaan teen nae ghat banane ke prastaav par kaam shuru karne ko kaha
 These three ghats will be - Lohia, Rajnarayan and Malaviya
 inke bare main kaaphi samay se baatcheet ho rahi thi lekin sarkaar ab narendra modi ke 84 ghaaton ke vikaas kii baat sunakar jag gai he
 Modi wants to make all the Ghats of Varanasi beautiful and has said to make big plans for their development
 lekin ab akhilesh sarkaar vahaan teen nae ghat banaakar logon ko prabhavit karnaa chaahati he taaki pehle vaahvahee luti jaae
 The new ghats will be built on the banks of the Ganges before the Harishchandra Ghat

 Regardless of how much love you have, there must be a fight at some time
 amuman ladaaiyaan asahmati hone par hoti hai lekin ye kuch aisi jagahen hai jahaan ladaai hona tay he:1
 If you are traveling together while traveling together, there may be a fight between you
 aksar aisa hota he ki mahilaayein packing karte samay ye dhyaan nahin rakhti hai ki wo ghoomane ja rahi hai na ki ghar basaane
 The more stuff, the more trouble
 aise main aapkaa partner aapse chidh saktaa he
 2

 Often men praise other women and may not like this thing
 dinar ke bich main aap use said aane ko kahen or phir apana gussa jaahir karen
 Doing this will spoil the mood of both of you and returning home, it can turn into a ruckus
 3
 During the party or wedding, many couples start comparing themselves to others as they go to the party or wedding
 ek-duusare kaa haath thame kapal ko dekhakar apane partner ko taana maarna shuru kar dete hai
 They complain to each other that he no longer loves or loves them
 aisi sthiti rishte ko kamjor kar sakati he or aapke bich ladaai kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 4

 ye kuch aisi paristhitiyaan hai jinamein pati-patni or parteners ke bich ladaai hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 But if both of them work a little wisely, then these battles can be avoided

 The notice states that an unconditional apology should be given for defaming Gautam Gambhir
 anyathaa is maamle main kanoonee karrwai ke liye taiyaar rahen
 What is the case? On Thursday, Atishi had claimed that his rival bjp's Gautam Gambhir had distributed pamphlets in the constituency which were objectionable and abusive
 aatishi ne kaha tha, "meraa gambhir ji se bas ek yahi sawaal he ke agar wo mere jaisi ek shashakt mahila ko haraane ke liye itnaa gir sakate hai to saansad banane ke baad wo apane kshetra kii mahilaon ko kaise surakshit karenge
 "on this, Kejriwal said, 'never thought that Gambhir could fall so far down
 mahilaayein kaise surakshit hone kii ummid kar sakati hai agar log is maansikta ke saath chunaav lard rahe hai
 Keep the fire at bay

 Sahaj rag-virag: Mridulayah is a collection of love poems of young poet Hari Mridul
 premi jivan main sahajata se umgane vaale raag-viraag, udhyam or ulatbansiyon ko abhivyakt karne kii koshish kii he mridul ne
 The poet has a positive vision about all the activities related to this life
 apane jivananubhav se kavi jaan paata he ki prem ko lekar kiye gaye udhyam aakhir jivan ko samrudh karte hai: pyaar kii khatir hi maine ragadkar cheharaa dhoyaa / deh mel-mel nahaaya / royaa / hitchkee le lekar / ghanton khadaa rahaa / dhoop main / barsaat main / sheet main / pyaar kii khatir kiye saare udhyam / mere kaam aae
 The secret that is in love is the vocal
 aisi baaten tamaam kavi lekhak likh-kah gaye hai
 The same thing is said by Hari in his natural style: You too are silent / i am also silent / this silence / different thing
 prem main ausat logon kii tarah hari bhi kasame khate, filmi baat karte hai
 Film talk is rather more
 sangrah main ek khand he is baar barsaat
 There is less chanting of the word love in it, so poems are better
 isamen jivan ke anubhavon se prem ke sfooton ko saamne laane kii kavi kii koshish kuch safal hui haih hajaar buundon se bachaa liya jab tan / ek boond se man bhig gaya
 Wherever such drops fall, the poem comes to life: suddenly a fish / comes with the sound of a dukk and keeps drowning us
 
 
 / is tarah subah se shaam biit jaati he / ham taal main chehre nahin dekh pate
 In these poems, you can see the sound of that old reversal of love, in which 'jin Dubehe Woh Paar' is said
 boojh gaya hum ek baat kavita main bhi kavi kahata haih prem main dub janaa / praapt karnaa he / param gyaan
 The poet has played too much of the ultimate elements like ultimate knowledge, ultimate holy night
 ye bhav drishyon, kriyaaon ke madhyam se apni saadagi main vyakt hote to zyada prabhavi hote
 No one considers you holy by your holy chanting
 pavitrataa kaa abhas sahajata se hona chahie kavita main yaa jivan main
 Nan Sarovar / Water of compassion / Under lip / Black mole / Like Kandra / Just keep wandering
 til ko gupha samaj lene jaisi niri bhavukta se ubarna chahie kavi ko
 In Shamsher's words, "sentimentalism is such a capital of the poet that one has to be tamed, he will have to work with it, not be swept away in his blood
" ''acha he ki hari ne prem kavitaayen likhane kii koshish kii
 Some things have become good but the poet needs patience
 bhavukta or aavegamay udbodhano par prem kaa naam chaspaan kar dene se hi aap prem ke kavi nahin ho jaaenge
 The question is to express the complexity of love
 ek nigaah se ji janaa, duusari se mar janaa
 Sleep failure in the way of union
 jaan lene-dene kaa swang karnaa
 All such incidents are also here with Hari
 kuch na sahi, ve baahar-bheetar ujaalaa to failaa hi rahe hai

 PM Modi's address in Texas on 22 September: Donald Trump will be attending the Modi Modi program
 Trump will be the first time both will be included in this huge event
 pradhanmantri narendra modi apane america daure par bhartiya samudaay ko sambodhit karenge, jahaan par 50 hajaar se adhik log shaamil hone vaale hai
 This will be the first time that trump-modi will address such a mega event
 haalanki, is kaarykram se duniya ko bada sandesh milegaa jab duniya ke sabase bade or puraane loktantr ke netaa saath honge
 The world will get a big message: Between the US trade war going on with China and India's tensions with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, the coming together of the two leaders gives a big message
 bharat ubhartee hui arthvyavastha he or china-america ke bich chal rahe trade war kaa phayda uthaa saktaa he, isi daure par piem america ke bade udyogpatiyon ke saath roundtable par charchaa karenge
 The US has recently joined India on Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 donald trump ne pehle madhyasthata kii baat to kii lekin baad main bharat ke sakht rukh se unhone kaha ki madhyasthata tabhi hogi jab bharat kahegaa
 And PM Modi clearly said that this is the issue of India
 america chunaav main modi kaa jalawaa?khaas baat ye bhi he ki agle saal america main raashtrapati chunaav hone hai or isi saal november se premier chunaav shuru ho jaaenge
 In such a situation, American political pundits are also watching this program from this perspective
 darasal, america main 50 lakh ke kareeb bhartiya samudaay ke log rahete hai jo chunaav ke vakt kisi kaa bhi palada baari kar sakate hai
 In this way, everyone wants to draw the voters of the Indian community in their own way
 yahi kaaran he ki houdi modi main naa sirf republican balki democrates ke saansad bhi shaamil ho rahe hai
 In the 2016 election too, President Donald Trump used slogans like 'abki Bar Trump Government', 'I Love Hindu', 'I Love Modi' during his campaign and tried to woo the voters of Indian community
 
 texas hi kyon he khaas?texas america kaa doosraa sabase bada rajya he, kshetrafal or jansankhya donon ke hisaab se
 If we talk about the voters here, about 4 percent of the voters are of Asian descent (as of 2018), with a majority of the voters in the Indian community
 agar taaja baat karen to texas main congressman (saansad), governor donon hi ripulbican party ke hai, lekin ye hameshaa democrates kaa hi garh rahaa he
 Apart from this, there is also a special figure that in 2016, when Donald Trump was standing for the US presidential election, he lost his party in Texas
 republican party main premier chunaav ke dauraan ted cruge ko 43 fisadi or donald trump ko maatr 26 fisadi vot mili the
 However, Donald Trump won the presidential candidacy because of an edge across America
 jiske baad jab muqabla donald trump banaam hillari clinton ke bich hua to trump ko 52 fisadi or hillari ko 43 fisadi vot mili the
 If you look at the data of the last few elections, the attitude of the asian-indian voters has always been towards the Democrats, in such a way, the efforts of the Republican Party are always trying to woo them

 This is welcomed by the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad after the new affidavit filed by the Shia Waqf Board ahead of the crucial hearing on December 5 in the Supreme Court on the Ram Janmabhoomi
 akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad or ummid jataai he ki maamle kaa hal ab jaldi nikalegaa
 The Shia Waqf Board has said that they want a Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya
 mangalvaar ko shiya vakf board ke mukhiya or akhaada parishad ke mahanton ne dilli main saajha press conference kii
 Shia Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi has raised a new controversy in the case, alleging that Pakistan is behind this whole controversy and some radical clerics do not want the matter resolved because it is funding them
 rizvi kaa kahana he ki pakistan is prakaran main shaamil he
 Shia Waqf Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi said in a shared press conference with the intention of all the Akhadas in Kalkaji Peeth, Delhi, that 'this controversy is flourishing in India like a stigma'
 2000 se zyada katl hua or dange hue
 The Supreme Court has given the opinion that all parties should enter into a reconciliation agreement
 kuch tathakthith kattarpanthi or maulavee nahin chaahate ki maamle kaa hal nikle kyon ki isse unki funding ho rahi he
 Pakistan is involved in this case
 kyonki wo log supreme court kii baat kaa sammaan karne ke liye saamne nahin aa rahe? shiya vakf board ko chup rakhaa gaya
 Without a Shia Waqf Board approval, how did the lawyer stand on behalf of the Shia Board in the Supreme Court
 hamane supreme court main apni baat rakhi he
 The rest who built the temple by demolishing the temple was the rest who was Babar's commander
 itihaas ke mutabik babar ne apni sena ke namaaj padhane ke liye mandiron ko todaa
 The British did not want the issue to be resolved
 angrejon ke agent aaj tak is par lard rahe hai
 The High Court verdict was a disputed Judgment
 sunni board kaa adhikaar hi nahin he, sirf shiya vakf board hi adhikaar rakhata he
 Child knows that Ram is the birthplace of Ayodhya
 hamane shiya board kii baithak main ye prastaav diya ki vahaan mandir bane or ayodhya main parikrama ke parisar se dur kahin masjid bane
 'he further stated that
 'hamane ye masauda taiyaar kiya he ki vivaad khatm karen or ram janmabhumi ke upar se apana adhikaar samaapt karte hue adhikaar hinduon ko dete hai or lakhanu main ek masjid banaai jaae
 If a mosque is built in Ayodhya, there will be controversy
 aisi jagah namaaj koun padhegaa? kya kattarpanthi log hinduon se namaaj padhaaenge? hamane supreme court main masauda de diya he
 We need justice from the court
 court tay kare ki jo log samjhauta nahin chaahate unhen adhikaar kya he
 At the same time, Nirvani Akhara Parishad President Mahant Dharmadas, who is also a party in the Kiram Janmabhoomimale case, says that some people are doing business in the name of temple construction
 dharmadas ne sidhe sidhe ravishankar kii madhyasthata par hamale bolte hue kaha ki ravishankar jaise pachaason log gum rahe hai tivi par aane ke liye
 Ravi Shankar is a business man
 mahant dharmadas kaa kahana he ki akhaada parishad ke adheen ram mandir bane or saal 2017 main hi mandir banane kaa kaam shuru ho
 At the same time, Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad President Narendra Giri Maharaj says that since the Asia Board has agreed, our claim will be strong
 hamane ravishankar kii madhyasthata kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 They have come very late
 unhen pehle aana chahie tha
 Only the Sunni Waqf Board disagrees
 sahmati bani to thik nahin court main baat rakh rahe hai court ke nirnay ko maanenge
 Hopefully, the decision of the Shia Board will help us
 court ke faisle ke baad tay karenge
 If the verdict comes against, then we will build a temple by making laws bijepi kii sarkaar he or vishwa hindu parishad ke saath milakar mandir vahaan banakar rahegaa

 However, before 15 February, the party will start the Give Up Ticket Scheme (scheme) for its current mps
 iskaa matlab he ki maujuuda saansad apni jagah kisi duusare kaaryakarta ko chunaav ladaane ke liye swechha se tikat par apni daavedaari chhodane kii ghoshnaa karenge
 a senior BJP general secretary says that mps who voluntarily give up ticket claims can do so either publicly or secretly at the party forum
 kya yah prakriya varisht saansadon masalan laal krishna adwani, murali manohar joshi jaise netaaon par tikat kii daavedaari chhodane kaa dabaav banane ke liye he ? yah poochne par ek mahasachiv kehete hai, "ji nahin
 The party has made it clear several times that activists or leaders above 75 years of age are not banned from contesting elections
 haa, inhen jimmedaari nahin di jaae is par party main aam raay he
 "then what is the purpose of the Give Up scheme? a party leader says that there are many mps in the party who are trying to make a place in Parliament for new people
 bhaajapa kaa daawa he ki vah duniya kii sabase badi raajnneetik party hai jiske paas 11 karod se adhik sadsy hai
 In such a situation, if only one person continues to contest the election of MP or MLA, then there will be no room for new people
 yah maujuuda saansadon or vidhayakon kii jimmedaari he ki vah nae logon ke liye jagah banaaen
 mps or mlas who do so can go ahead and request not to contest elections on the party forum
 gauratlab he ki pichley saal agast main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke nirdesh par sabhi saansadon se yah kaha gaya tha ki vah apane kshetra ke paanch prabhaavshaalee or yogya kaaryakartaaon kii soochin saunpe
 Many mps did this
 sutron kaa kahana he ki darasal is baar bahut se saansadon ke tikat katenge
 In such a situation, the Give Up Ticket Scheme can be beneficial to ensure that there is no resentment among the supporters of mps
 naaraaz logon ko party yah bataa sakati he ki tikat kaata nahin gaya he balki saansad ne khud hi is baar chunaav nahin ladane kii ichha vyakt kii he

 Committee chairman John Wittingdale said that at various points Murdoch was willing to write to the committee, on which he failed to speak during the hearing
 unhone kaha, main aashwast hum ki agar colin meyar or unke vaktavy mail nahin khaaenge, to ham unase iskaa jawaab dene ko bhi kahenge
 Labor MP Watson told the BBC that this was the most important moment in the two-year investigation into phone hacking
 watasan ne kaha, agar (meyar or krone) ke bayaan sahi hai to ye dikhaate hai ki james murdoch ko 2008 se hi jaankaree thi ki anya log hekking main shaamil hai
 This shows that he failed to discipline his personnel or initiate an internal investigation and this undermines Rupert Murdoch's claim made before our committee that the company does not tolerate wrongdoings at all
 unhone kaha ki isse bhi mahatvapurn yah he ki vah is aparaadh ko police ko darj karaane main na keval naakaam rahe, balki unhone tailor (profeshnal footbalers association ke mukhya kaaryakari) ko chup rahane ke liye kharida
 Watson said this could mean he is facing an investigation to spoil the investigation
 murdoch ne samiti ko kaha tha ki unhen us i-mail kii jaankaree nahin thi, jisamen news of world ke reporter dwaara hekking ke istemaal kii baat kahi gai thi

 K
 singh ne yah kitaab 'fidel kastro' na likhi hoti to ham yahaan unki charchaa na kar rahe hote
 Fidel Castro had become a symbol of anti-imperialism all over the world during his lifetime
 maatr pachchis varsh kii aayu main mutthi-bhar saathiyon ko lekar or bina kisi bahari madad ke fidel kastro ne cuba ke taanashaah batista or uske poshak america samrajyavad ko sadaa-sadaa ke liye cuba se vidaa kar diya tha
 Fidel Castro, who transformed Cuba's exploited-oppressed peasants, laborers into revolutionary warriors, and developed his country into a better nation on the principles of social justice, created new definitions of internationalism and freed the entire world from all forms of inequality
 Dreamed a big dream of
 aaj is sapane ko vishwa kaa har vah insaan apane dil ke kareeb mahasoos karata he jo is duniya ko manushya ke bhavishya ke liye ek surakshit awaas main badalanaa chahta he
 The life of Fidel Castro is at the center of this book, which tells the history of the Cuban Revolution, para-by-para
 lekhak ke vyapak shodh or gahari patibaddhta se upji yah pustak na sirf fidel ke jivan, balki cuba tathaa shesh vishwa kii un raajnneetik-aarthik paristhitiyon kaa bhi tathyaadhaarit vivaran detii he, jiske bich fidel kaa udbhav hua or cuba-kranti sambhav hui
 This book also gives ample space to the ideology that inspired the revolution, which led to Fidel's dream, first Cuba, and then every judicious person in the world
 is pustak se hamen fidel ke sabase bharosemand saathi che guyavara ko bhi kaaphi najadik se jaanane kaa mauka miltaa he, jinke jivan kaa ekmaatr uddeshy duniya main jahaan bhi samrajyavad he, uske viruddh sangharsh karnaa tha, or alp aayu main hi jivan balidaan karne ke baavjood jo aaj har jaagruk yuva hryday main jivit hai!fidel: ek jinda kranti, ek sachcha jeevanfidel kastro ko ghatnaon or uplabdhiyon ke daayre main nahin parkhaa ja saktaa
 Actually, Fidel cannot be tested under any scope
 fidel ek vichaar, ek adarsh, ek sapane kaa naam he
 It is the name of the infinite possibilities of man and humanity
 vichaar, adarsh, sapane or sambhaavnaaen simaaon ke mohataaj nahin hote
 Countless names and titles - Commandant of the Cuban Revolution, Ann Jefe (commander-in-chief), Maximo Lieder (greatest Leader), half-century President of Cuba, Creator of New Cuba, New World, Hope of New Society, Cuban Council of The president of the state, the first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba - beyond all these boundaries, only one name is fully recognized for Fidel's personality work - 'fidel
 'cuba kii kranti ke sandarbh main fidel kaa kahana he: 'cuba kii kranti ko cuba ke nazariye se dekhnaa samajhnaa hoga
 'fidel's life also has to be seen and understood from Fidel's perspective
 fidel ke anusaar unhone apana sara jivan puri sahajata or shaanti se jiya he
 Regarding Fidel as dictator, cruel or cynical by the United States or his few allies, Fidel says that it is part of a world-wide campaign to spread the poison of hate
 ve sochate hai ki agar aap lagaataar prachaar karte rahe ki yah aadmi shaitan se bhi khatarnaak he, log usase dhire-dhire nafrat karne hi lagenge
 Fidel's authority is based on the power of the people, the influence among the people, and the public's respect he gained from historical references, which he never misused — never ran government with arbitrary judgment, order, or decree
 cuba main raashtrapati pranali kii sarkaar nahin he
 There is a national parliament and a council of ministers, it has a collective leadership
 har mahatvapurn nirnay sochane-samajhane-vichaar-vimarsh-bahes karne ke baad samuhik rup se liya jaataa he
 Ministers or ambassadors are not appointed by the President
 agar iskaa naam taanaashaahee he to yah aisa sochnewaalon kii samasya he
 Who has spent all his life against injustice, against all forms of oppression-exploitation-tyranny, working for others, fighting for others, developing solidarity, cooperation and affinity among people? Who has always taken care of protecting the physical and mental dignity of man? In Cuba no prisoner is tortured, no one is killed, no 'missing', no 'wiped out'
 cuba main kabhi apatkaal nahin lagu kiya gaya- kabhi kisi virodh-pradarshan par ek bhi lathi, ansu gas yaa goli nahin chali
 An exception to all this cannot be found
 cuba kii kranti janata kii, samooche raashtra kii apni kranti he, unke apane khun, apni takat se hasil or unke apane samarthan, apni koshishon or apni himmat se rakshit
 Millions of young Cuban youth volunteers joined in their struggles, shed their blood, martyrdom, at the voice of liberation from the people of all African, Asian, Latin American countries from their tyrannical-cruel-broker exploiters
 latini america or usase baahar bhi, teesri duniya ke tamaam deshon main hajaaron cubai doctor, chikitsakarmi, shikshak, krishi-visheshgy apni sevaayen de rahe hai
 Tens of thousands of students from Latin America and all over the world are getting specialist education in medical science free of cost
 yadi in sabakaa naam taanaashaahee, krurta or sanak he to yah soch kii samasya he
 Regarding his life, Fidel says that he is always the most harsh about himself, always making his mistakes, fighting himself
 unhen kaam par yakeen he, dikhaave par nahin
 You always have to fight your inner instincts
 unka maananaa he ki yah shikshan he, gambheer or lagaataar chalanevaala, kabhi haar nahin maanane vaala swa-shikshan jo ek adane se praani ko manushya banaata he
 The source of human energy is not his physical ability, his determination, his commitment - so energy does not decrease with age, more enthusiasm, more commitment, more impulse
 fidel kabhi niraash nahin hote, kabhi haar nahin maanate, kabhi maidan nahin chhodte
 He has unwavering faith in the public, he has never been discouraged
 fidel kehete hai ki puure jivan main vishwasghaat kii mushkil se do-chaar gini-chuni ghatnaon se unka saamana hua hoga
 90 leaders of the revolutionary struggle and the Navnirman Abhiyan have been since Fidel's 26th July movement
 unamem koi bhi aisa nahin niklaa jisane kranti se vishwasghaat kiya ho
 Everyone lived with their revolution till the end and lived for the revolution
 apane sahyogiyon-saathiyon ko yaad karte hue fidel kehete hai ki ve tamaam yoddha jo monkada yaa granma abhiyaan ke saathi the- che, camilo, raul, almida or tamaam saathi- valdes, garsia- kranti ke tamaam commandent ve asaadhaaran log the yaa hai jinhone sankat kii, nirnay kii har ghadi ko fauladi patibaddhta ke saath jiya, ek bhi avasar par, ek bhi kshan ke liye vichlit hue bina
 Today, along with the revolution, there is also the introduction of new ideas, new values, new blood and new energy of those next generations who were not born till the time of the revolution victory
 unamem na jane kitne kranti ke nayakon, yoddhaon, shaheedon ke rakt se paidaa hue hai
 They can never betray the revolution
 apni vardi ke bare main fidel kehete hai ki siyera abhiyaan ke jamaane se hi vah ise hameshaa pahante aa rahe hai or isamen khud ko sabase sahaj mahasoos karte hai
 It has become a habit
 fidel kii vardi main siyera ke jamaane se hi lagbhag koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Fidel, the victorious warrior of countless struggles, does not put on his uniform, no embellishments
 aage ke dinon main naagarik paridhaanon ko bhi pahanane ko lekar vah yaad karte hai ki 1994 main centiyago de-laa-india ke ibera-america shikhar sammelan main columbian mejabaanon ne sabhi rashtradhyakshon se columbian parmparik paridhaan 'guyaabera' pahanane kaa aagrah kiya
 Since then he has been wearing 'civilian suits' on the occasion of international meetings and conferences and also in Cuba on special occasions
 fidel ko unke pita ne 14-15 varsh kii aayu main unki pehali cigar 'peuro habaano' thama di
 Since then he continued to drink cigars and it became a part of his image
 fidel ne kareeb pichley tees saalon se cigar ko haath nahin lagaaya
 Fidel says that this was his essential sacrifice for the good of the country and the health of the people
 motopa, manamaani jeevanstyli or tambaaku ke swasthya par padane vaale bhayaavah dushprabhavon ko sunate hue fidel ne faisla liya ki jan-swasthya ke hit main unhen yah aadat chhod deni chahie
 Regarding his mistakes, Fidel believes that he has made mistakes, but they all forgot the strategic and not the strategic mistakes

 Swami Atmastanand, 97, has been ill for the past several days
 21 farvari ko unhen kolkata main maujuud ramakrishna mishan seva pratishthan main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The PM and Swami have a long standing relationship
 In 1966, Swami came to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Rajkot

 Then Modi came to meet Swami and stay with him in the ashram
 kaha jaataa he ki isse pehlemodi ne kuch saal aadhyatm seekhney main bitaayethe
 After spending a few days in the ashram with Swami, Modi told him that he wanted to become a monk
 lekin swami ne unase kaha ki vah sanyas lene ke liye nahin bane hai
 Anyway, Rajkot Ashram did not initiate becoming a monk
 swami ne modi se kaha ki agar vah sachmuch sanyasi bananaa chaahate hai to unhen belur math janaa hoga
 Belur Math Swami Madhavanand, the then Mathashish, also rejected Modi's application
 unhone modi se kaha ki vah logon kii khatir kaam karne ke liye bane hai na ki sanyas ke liye
 Mododi then took membership of the National self-service Association and entered politics
 phool jeb main rakh, lee thi pradhanmantri pad kii shapathyah baat bahut kam logon ko pataa hogi ki jab modi ne pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee thi tab unke jacket ke pocket main ek phool tha

 ' jisase unhone puraane noton ko hataakar nae note laane kii prakriya main lagane vaali deree kii ore hi sanket diya he
 When asked why the government did not make these changes in ATM machines beforehand, Jaitley said that this would have ended the 'secrecy' of the government's surprise move
 siemes ke upaadhyaksh evam mukhya kaaryakari adhikari rajeev kaul ne bataaya ki sarkaar kii ghoshnaa ke baad tatkaal kadam atm mashiinon se puraane noton ko hataanaa hona chahie
 Then the second step would be to fill the ATM machines with new notes
 kaul ne kaha, 'lekin isse pehle sunishchit karnaa hoga ki har atm mashin nae noton ko sweekaar kare or kam keemat vaali noton se atm mashiinon ko baar-baar bharna hoga
 'this is the real challenge
 kyonki sabhi atm mashiinon ke trey badalane honge
 ATM machines will also have to be tested before filling new notes
 kaul ne bataaya, 'hamaara maananaa he ki deshbhar kii atm mashiinon main ye saare badlaav karne main do se chaar saptaah lag jaaenge
 Anuj Chauhan, a bank worker in Delhi, said that to reconfigure an ATM machine, a technician would have to go to the ATM machine himself and the entire process could take up to four hours to reconfigure one machine
 iskaa matlab he ki desh bhar kii atm mashiinon ko riknfigar karne main aath lakh ghante lagenge
 The comments agar ek takanisian ek din main do atm mashiinon ko rikanfigar kar paata he to desh bhar kii atm mashiinon ko 30 din main rikanfigar karne ke liye aise 4,000 takanicianon kii jarurat padegi
 It is also a challenge to gather such a large number of technicians
 agar is puri prakriya main swaabhaavik vilamb or gadabadiyon ko shaamil kiya jaae to iskaa matlab he ki bank or atm mashiinon ke baahar lagi lambii kataren jald choti nahin hone vaaleen

 If sources are to be believed, some ministers have not been able to give details of their property due to the busy schedule
 iske pehle centre main modi sarkaar ne bhi apane mantriyon se chal-achal sampatti kaa byoraa maanga tha
 The BJP government has been claiming corruption-free and transparent governance, so ministers have been asked to make the property details public first

 kai logon ke saath ye dikkat hoti he ki maheenaa khatm hone se pehle hi unki selary khatm ho jaataa he
 The reason for this is to spend their unlimited expenses and not make plans
 aise main aapako apane bajet ko lekar kai baaten dhyaan main rakhni hogi, taaki har maheene aapako is dikkat kaa saamana naa karnaa pade
 Let's know what those things are
 
 
 kharchaa trek karen-agar pas khatm hone kii dikkat aapke saath bhi he to sabase pehle ek din baithkar ye pataa karen ki aap har maheene kin-kin chizon main zyada kharch kar rahe hai
 By doing this, make a list and make this list with complete honesty
 apane kharchon ko lekar khulkar likhen or uske baad us par vichaar karen ki kahaan aapkaa kharchaa zyada ho rahaa he
 Make a money plan till you get a job - when you know about your expenses, then prepare your budget plan
 in kharchon main phijul kharchon kii list banaaen or aise kharchon kii bhi list banaaen, jahaan aap katautee kar sakate hai
 After this, gradually spend your expenses according to this plan
 isamen aap har din ke hisaab se bhi apana plan bana sakate hai
 Invest by saving - start saving to save money
 saath hi thodaa bahut paisa jamaa hone par use kahin nivesh kar den, isse aapkaa paisa sef bhi rahegaa or aapako usase phayda bhi hoga
 For this, you can also resort to fds, mutual funds etc
 naukari ke saath-saath shuru karen ye bijness, jald hone lagegi kamaailag se kamai kaa jariya-agar aap koi aisa kaam karte hai, jisase aap extra inakam bhi kama sakate hai to jarur ye kaam karnaa shuru kar den
 For this, you can take a small project in hand, so that you have a separate income with salary
 party ko kahen naa-aajkal logon ke paise junk food yaa party aadi main zyada kharch ho rahe hai, agar aap bhi aisa karte hai to in sabase dur rahane kii koshish karen
 This includes your liquor, cigarettes, hotel expenses etc
 aap inamen thodi si katautee karke hi acha paisa kama sakate hai
 BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on the no-confidence motion that will be brought against the government, 'see which party goes with whom in Parliament
 ' unhone kaha ki yah chunavi saal he
 Every state has its own demands and issues

 It is a tradition that one such rehearsal takes place in Parliament before the election
 bihar vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa or rashtriya janata dal ke supremeo lalu yadav ke chote bete tejasvi yadav patna waapas aa gaye hai
 Tejashwi Yadav, who despite being the Leader of the Opposition, came to show only his face for a few minutes in a two-month-long assembly session, has finally returned at the behest of his father Lalu Yadav
 pita ne unhen aashwaasan diya he ki unki ichha ke mutabiq party main unhen pita ke baad jo bhi mahatvapurn pad hota he wo unhen sanghathan ke chunaav ke baad diya jayega
 Lalu Yadav said that after this agreement, now the leaders of the party, including some senior leaders like Bhai Virendra, have started demanding that if the party is also given the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, it will send a good message among the youth of the state
 philhal ye maang karne vaale bhai virendra akele nahin he
 Apart from them, Kumar Sarabjit, MLA elected from Bodh Gaya, Vijay Prakash, MLA from Jamui has also publicly appeared in support of this demand
 mana ja rahaa he ki lalu yadav se green signal milane ke baad hi ye log saarvajanik rup se yah maang kar rahe hai ki party kii kaman unhen saunpane se party kaa bhavishya behatar hoga
 However, there are many senior leaders of the party who believe that Tejashwi Yadav has disappointed the mlas, activists and leaders of the party by his conduct after the Lok Sabha elections
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki bhale hi lalu yadav se imotional blackmel kar koi bhi pad tejasvi yadav hasil kar len lekin sachai yahi he ki ab bhi vartmaan main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa dur dur tak vikalp nahin dikhataa
 These leaders argue that the Leader of the Opposition is absent from the Assembly session
 baadh main logon ko dekhne naa jaae
 In the time of epidemic like chhmi fever kept roaming in Delhi
 un tejasvi yadav se soshal media par to raajnneeti ho sakati he, lekin jameen par nahin
 If he still wins the election then it will be a big achievement in itself

 Anupgarh MLA Shimla Bawri made this disclosure during a recent event
 yah kaarykram sthaneey patrakaron ne unke sammaan main bulaayaa tha
 The reason for the honor was that MLA Shimla Bawri had decided to allot plots for journalists in the district
 'teen patrakaron ne kaha-baad main lenge paise'angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne kaarykram main shivala baawari ke bhaashan ke hawaale se yah khabar di he
 In her speech, she herself admits that she sent envelopes to journalists of her constituency
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki teen patrakaron ne yah kehete huepaise lautaa dieki chunaav jeetne ke baad ve ise le lenge
 Ironically, in his speech, MLA Sahiba also regretted the declining level of journalism
 akhbaar ne jab unase video par unka paksh jaanane ke liye sampark kiya to unhone aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki video se chhedchhad kii gai he
 Video tampered with: MLA said, 'this is silly
 yah jhootha video he
 There is a small journalist who takes out a two-page fortnightly newspaper and through it he troubles people
 'video main bijepi vidhayak kahati najar aa rahi hai, 'main garib parivaar se aati hum

 jab mujhase congress ke bhavishya ke bare main likhane ko kaha gaya to mujhe kaaphi hichak hui
 After all, for the second time, i have come fresh and fresh victories and as such i am still new in the party
 main congress kaary samiti (seedblusi) kaa sadsy bhi nahin hum, na hi party kii kisi duusari nirnaayak samiti kaa sadsy hum
 But then, as an elected representative of the Congress, i made up my mind to accept this challenge, because i am amazed to read stories of my party's untimely end
 haalanki main aakhil bhartiya congress (eisisi) kaa pravaktaa hum lekin main yah saaf karnaa chaahunga ki yah mere nijee vichaar hai
 First of all, i would like to say openly that the stories of our endings are being told very exaggeratedly
 congress puri tarah jinda he or janata ke bich aaj bhi acchhee-khaasi pakad rakhti he
 We got only 20 per cent of the votes in the general elections of the country, this does not make us irrelevant in a highly divided and competitive politics
 ham 13 rajyon main satta main hai or puure desh bhar main hamaari maujuudagi he, jiskaa jod koi nahin kar saktaa
 Yet it is sad to be reduced to just 44 seats in the Lok Sabha and realizes the need for reform
 yah sudhaar aakhir kya ho saktaa he? nitiyon-siddhanton or kaaryakramon ke aath suzav yah ho sakate haizham tay karen ki hamaara makasad kya he or use lagaataar janata tak prabhavi dhang se pahunchaaen
 The core principles of the Congress are built on the values that it has gained from the freedom movement, especially for integrated development, social justice, poverty alleviation and protection of all marginalized people including minorities, women, Dalits and tribals
 inke prati saidhantik patibaddhta ko mahaj vot bank kii raajnneeti ke rup main tod-marodakar pesh kar diya jaataa he
 We are political advocates of India's diversity and are fully committed to protecting the basic principles of secularism
 hamen apane in mulyon ko har maukey par joardaar dhang se dohraane kii jarurat he
 This means that our leaders will have to give up their habit of hesitance and emphasize these values in a loud voice on all forums including social media
 aisa karne se hamaare mulyon, kaaryakramon, niyat or sarokaaron kii logon tak pahunch adhik tej hogi
 If we talk to people, then we can easily bring them in our favor
 21veen sadi kii media aadhaarit raajnneeti main khule samvaad kii jarurat he jisase congress haal ke varshon main bachati rahi he
 Develop a vision of the future, which contains the aspirations of the majority youth of the country
 is saal ascharyajanak rup se 40 fisadi matadaata 35 saal se kam umr ke rahe hai
 They want to know from us what we have done and can do for them
 hamaari party ne shiksha or skill deveopment kii disha main kai pahal kii hai lekin rojgaar srijan ke maamle main ye koshishen naakaafi rahi hai
 We need to formulate policies in this area that are applicable in the states ruled by our party and the Center can be told about them
 desh ke yuvaaon ko yah yakeen dilaanaa hoga ki ham unki ummiido ko samajhate hai or sarkaar main unhen aage badhaane kaa bharosa dilaate hai
 Do not let BJP maintain a monopoly on nationalism
 congress ke paas rashtriya hiton kii raksha kaa sabase gaharaa anubhav he or use garv se apane rashtrawaad kaa khulkar izhaar karnaa chahie or suraksha tathaa videsh niti ke un maamalon main sakriyata banaae rakhni chahie jisamen bijepi sarkaar laaparvaahiyaan kar rahi ho
 Although it has been our tradition that all kinds of political protests are confined to the land of the country, the matter of foreign policy is not of any party but of the whole country, yet we are allowed to express this to the BJP through our government It should not be given that only one can protect the pride of the country, about which our definition may be different
 sansad ke baahar or bheetar rachanaatmak vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaaen
 This does not mean surrender to the bjp's majority
 lekin mahaj virodh ke liye virodh karne (jaisaa bijepi kaa upie shashan ke dauraan ravaiya rahaa he) se ham modi ko mili janadesh ke khilaaf khadey honge or janata ke gusse kaa shikaar honge
 There is a feeling in the country that "those people ruled for so long, why don't they want to give them a chance now?" So it is in our interest that whenever the BJP takes any positive initiative, we will support it and when If you bring a divisive agenda, fight it out firmly
 jamini str par party ko majboot karne par dhyaan lagaaya jaae
 The Congress has indeed lost ground level contacts in many states
 hamen panchayat or sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon par zyada dhyaan dena chahie
 Most of the people of the country should pay attention to the minor problems arising out of government complicity and corruption, the problems for which the voters have punished us
 hamen apni raajnneeti ko vanchit or kamjor logon ke liye saamaajik kaary main tabdeel kar dena chahie
 Promote democracy within the party and overcome internal discord
 rahul gandhi lagaataar is par dhyaan de rahe hai
 Internal elections should be held on all key posts from CWC
 sthaneey str par or rajyon main netaaon ko aage badhayen
 But take stern action against those who prefer your personal ambitions and those who create discontent against party interest
 haal ke chunaavon main kai netaaon ne asantosh kaa ravaiya dikhaaya he
 When the party adopts such a stance towards elected leaders, it will be possible to take a tougher stance in the case of courtiers not contesting elections
 duusari partiyon ke saath vyaavhaarik gathjod par dhyaan den taaki kshetreey dal sarkaar virdohi manch kaa laabh na uthaa le jaaen
 If the coalition of regional parties takes away the benefit of outright opposition to the BJP government, then it will directly harm us
 ham sabase badi rashtriya vipakshi party hai isliye bijepi sarkaar kii asweekaarya nitiyon ke virodh kaa saajha manch hamen hi taiyaar karnaa chahie
 Political co-ordination will give us a chance to compete strongly in the assembly elections besides parliament
 lekin hamen yah saavdhaanee bhi rakhni hogi ki is talmail ke chakkar main hamaari sthaneey party ikai kaa bhatta na baith jaae
 In the long run, we can emerge as a strong alternative in those states where we have not been in power for almost two and a half decades
 ye rajya khaskar uttar pradesh, bihar, pashchim bengal or tamilnadu hai
 These states have 201 Lok Sabha seats, so we cannot ignore them at all
 centre sarkaar ko centre-rajya rishton par gheriye
 These are issues on which we can share the platform with regional parties
 hamaare paas 13 rajya sarkarein hai or centre ke ekadhikaar ke khilaaf aawaaj buland karne main hamaara rajnatik hit he
 At the same time, we should focus on the good performance of our state governments to prove that our party is capable of running the government
 yahi bijepi hamase chhinana chaahati he
 It also means that we have to send some of our national leaders to strengthen the party in the states
 vaise bhi dilli main nai vyavastha ke baad ab zyada kuch karne ke liye bachaa nahin rahaa he
 These suggestions are not very long, but in my opinion, these are some important sources to move ahead of the oldest party in the country and bring back the old glory

 8 days after the murder of ND Tiwari's son Rohit Shekhar, the police are still empty
 shaq kii sui ab keval teen logon rohit kii patni,uske driver or naukar par he
 If sources are to be believed, in a statement to the police, the wife claimed that she was intimate with Shekhar that night and may have been strangled and strangled
 rohit shekhar hatyakand main police ke saamne rohit shekhar kii patni ne jo daawa kiya wo chaukaane vaala he
 If sources are to be believed, Apoorva told that she went to Rohit's room on April 15-16
 wo rohit ke saath antarang thi
 It is possible that Rohit's throat and mouth have been buried due to which he has died
 haalanki police kaa maananaa he ki ek vakil hone ke naate use pataa he ki kanoon se kaise bachanaa he isliye wo ye daawa hatya ko ek durghatana bataane ke liye kar rahi ho
 Because Rohit was very intoxicated at that time and even if this happened, then why didn't Apurva take him to the hospital immediately
 rohit ghar kii pehali manzil ke kamare main tha,uske bagal vaale kamare main patni apurva ,saamne vaale kamare main driver akhilesh or uske upar duusari manzil par naukar bholu tha, police ko shaq inhen teen logon par he
 Police has given police clean chit to all the other people of the house
 police ke mutabik sisitivi jaanch se pataa chalaa ki pehali manzil par inhen teen logon ke alaava na koi aayaa na koi gaya
 Police say drivers and servants will be involved in the murder
 isaki koi vajah ab tak nahin mili he
 Apoorva is a lawyer in the Supreme Court
 isliye unhen hatya karne kaa anjaam bhi pataa hoga
 The murder may have been caused by a charge
 ab tak ye maamla saazish ke tahat kii gai hatya kaa nahin lagata
 Some forensic report is awaited
 jisase ye sabit ho ki us raat shekhar ke kamare main koun tha
 No evidence of melee with Rohit was found
 sisitivi jaanch se pataa chalaa ki us raat pehali manzil par sabase pehle rohit ,phir driver akhilesh phir naukar bholu or phir apurva gayi
 Apoorva also asked servant Bholu to check Rohit's status at around 3 am the next day
 apurva ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki rohit ko anidra kii beemarithi
 So nobody woke up for 16 hours
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki ab police forencik report ke aadhaar par hi kaatil tak pahonchegi, or kaatil ke pakade jane ke baad makasad kaa khulaasa ho paayegaa
