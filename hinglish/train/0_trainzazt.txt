 BJP won 40 out of the total 90 assembly seats in the state while JJP is in the role of kingmaker winning 10 seats
 rajya kii 9 siten anya ke khate main gai hai jinamein INLD, HLP or nirdaleey shaamil hai
 No party has won a majority in Haryana and the BJP will form the government by joining smaller parties other than independents
 lekin is chunaav main congress agar thodaa or dam dikhaati to khatter sarkaar kii vaapasi mushkil thi
 There are about 10 seats in the state where the win-loss difference is 2
 5 hajaar voton se bhi kam rahaa he
 The Congress has lost some of these seats
 agar yah siten congress jitati to vah soobe kii sabase badi party ban sakati thi
 Then the Congress would first be invited to form the government and other parties would also be ready to go with it

 In this seat, bjp's Ghanshyam Das has defeated Congress's Dilbag Singh
 badkhal main congress sirf 2545 voton ke antar se bijepi pratyaashee se chunaav haar gai
 If the Congress had secured 7304 votes in these seats in total, it would have got 5 more seats in the party's account whereas the BJP camp could have reduced 5 seats
 tab jaakar sameekaran badal jate or congress kii siton kii sankhya 36 hoti jabaki bijepi 35 ke aankade par simat jaati
 After this, the Congress could also stake the claim of forming a government in the state with independents or JJP

 Looking at the electoral history of the state, a fact is clearly revealed that till now the people of the state have not given any party a chance to hit a hat-trick of victory
 das saal tak satta main rahane ke baad congress apatkaal ke baad 1977 main janata party kii aandhi main ud gayi thi
 However, it is another matter that even the Janata Party could not complete its tenure at that time and had to be out of power due to a mutual fight during a two and a half year reign
 tab sahanubhuti ne dilaayaa tha congress ko mauka, lekin
 
 
 After the dissolution of the Janata Party government, the Congress once again came to power and Chief Minister Arjun Singh ruled for five years
 varsh 1984 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue chunaav main congress phir se sahanubhuti ke sahare pradesh main sarkaar banane main safal rahi
 But during the tenure of the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the impact of the Bofors cannon scandal was also visible in Madhya Pradesh

 After this, Singh also won the 1998 assembly elections and became the chief minister for the second consecutive time
 is baar congress ko ummid thi ki vah teesri baar bhi sarkaar banane main safal ho jaayegi, lekin bijepi ke aakraamak prachaar or uma bharti ke tufaani dauron ne congress ko phir se satta kaa swaad chakhne nahin diya
 The Congress also suffered a humiliating defeat in this election

 But the Congress leaders too have put their full efforts to unite the BJP out of power

 isse pehle, donon timen is pratishthit toornament ko do-do baar jeet chuki hai
 History always supports the real heroes in the power of power
 bharat kaa sabase lokapriy netaa ek khantee bhartiya he jisamen vipareet paristhitiyon ko avasaron main badal lene kii vilakshan pratibha he
 In a country where renunciation is considered a moral virtue, the strip of ambition is clearly visible in the kurtas stitched in its special style
 bharat ke liye unke abhiyaan kii mahagatha dashak bhar pehle gujarat ke godhra stesan par ek railgadee ke jalane ke saath shuru hui thi
 He is also a screenwriter and a choreographer
 unke sabase visphotak sound bite khalis sadhi hui gujarati main milte hai
 Therefore, if Narendra Modi conveys the final battle in the words of Obama, then he is not the Modi we know
 yah bhi sach he ki loktantr main har nae khilaadi ke liye 2008 se shuru hui obama kii kahani prerana kaa strot he ki kaise raajnneeti main junun se bharaa insaan apni jivan katha ko bhagya kaa lekha bana letaa he or parivartan kii aandhi main kis tarah vanshawaliyon kii rudhipoon ke bandhan teetar-bitar ho jate hai
 In 2013, Modi's style is very similar to the election of the US President and in this case Sinajori is un-indian to the extent that he officially declares his wish before the race starts
 2008 main badlaav ke daur se guzar rahe america main ilinoy ke senetter ne kuch isi andaaj main apane naam se jud chuke ek idia ko bechaa tha
 Modi's declaration of 'yes we can' in another tremendous rally is not completely different from the references
 isamen ashaavadita bhale hi utani na ho par bhaavana to nishchit rup se he
 Forget 'yes We Can' for the time being, provided that the emperor of Gandhinagar does not speak in his own style
 india today samooh-si voter desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan se jo sawaal ubhara he vah yah ki kya ve karke dikhaa sakate hai
 Can he put an end to a decade of exile immersed in his party's defeat? kya ve aise chune hue maseehaa or sambhavit shaasha ban sakate hai jo bharat main dakshinpanth ke shikhar par adhikaar jamaa sake jahaan bijepi or congress ke tehraav kaa sidhaa arth kshetreey partiyon kaa udai he
 When Manmohan Singh's rule is certain to be remembered as the most corrupt and credible government of our time, will he be able to cash in on this infatuation, this poll shows that Modi is still the first public figure for the post of Prime Minister There are likes and there is no other leader in the family around the popularity platform
 unhone desh ke pramukh pradeshon main bijepi ke aadhaar ko urja di he or prabhaav mandal kaa vistaar kiya he, lekin kuch kar dikhaane vaale netaa kii chhavi ne abhi tak vot nahin dilaae hai
 The NDA is projected to get 155 seats in the Lok Sabha elections, which is only 18 seats more than the constantly sinking UPA
 pichley teen saal main lagaataar sidhiruaan chadhgaye ke baad yah giravat saaf mahasoos hoti he
 The NDA has increased its vote share since the 2009 general election but despite Modi, it did not reach around 200 in the January survey
 iskaa laabh kshetreey dalon ko miltaa dikh rahaa he jo chunaav baad kii saudebaaji ke liye baichaiyn hai
 Regional parties, separate from both the NDA or UPA, seem to win 251 seats
 inamen se zyaadaatar siten swaabhaavik rup se hindi pattee main apane aitihaasik gadhon main congress ke dhul chaatane se aati hai or purab main mamata banerjee kaa udai bhi iske liye jimmedaar he
 Are we stealing sight of India's political anarchy because the Subai Kshatrapas are flourishing at the cost of both the big parties
 isaki vajah yah ho sakati he ki koi aisa netaa nahin he jo apni party ko ekajute karke kshetreey takaton se apana khoyaa hua aadhaar chin sake
 The absence of such a leader is being felt most in India today
 modi ke paas bechney ke liye bhavishya ke sunahare khwab ho sakate hai or use bechney ke liye unki guhaar televijan ke parade or akhabaaron ke pehle pannon par to goonjati he lekin akasar aisa lagata he ki ve galat party main hai
 Generally, whenever a leader is strong, he himself becomes the party and its message
 lekin bijepi main aisa nahin he
 They may stand at the forefront of their counterpart leaders, but the collective contribution of "counterparts" is so much in terms of leadership that a confusing buzz is heard from the saffron camp
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri parivaar ke ekmaatr dabadabe vaale netaa nahin hai
 Accounts of progress of Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 jokha bhi kam shandaar nahin rahaa he
 Only on the basis of development and growth index, leaders cannot conquer the national public
 modi lambey samay se parivaar main akele chalate rahe hai or ab ve sirf apane vyaktitv ke dam or kadi mehnat ke bal par behad jaruri ban gaye hai
 He has never hesitated in expressing his ambitions, which has often hurt his party colleagues
 gujarat main unhone jo bhi vidhansabha chunaav ladaa or jitaae vah unke liye rashtriya yuddh se kam nahin tha
 He has always spoken about India's security, its self-respect and its development
 puraatanapanthi or dharmik kathaon ko dhone vaale is parivaar main unhone hameshaa khud ko aadhunik vichaarak ke rup main pesh kiya
 However those who point fingers at his secularism always describe him as a cannibal
 unki yah chaal kaamyaab bhi rahi he
 People in India, who were called villains of Gujarat 2002, came to buy tickets even in places in India which cannot be imagined
 modi ne apane dam par khud kii yah haisiyat banaai he
 Even then the family can knock them out
 parivaar main nazarandaaj kiye gaye sadsy asantosh ke alag-alag charnon se guzarate hue unki raah main baadha khadi kar sakate hai
 Of these, the greatest personality has all the essential qualities of the patron saint of the family, but he wants to look eternally stricken as if it is a crime not to give seniority and the award of being a saint
 bijepi main modi ke adhikansh samarthak apni pasand se vahaan nahin khadey hai
 They only want to appear next to the winner
 bhale hi vijeta team leader kii drushti se bahut hi zyada vyaktivaadee ho
 The battle of arrogance is going on within the party
 In these years of exile from the BJP, BJP has not even raised its separate voice
 vaicharik dharaatal par usne abhi tak saanskrithik algaav or oche poonjeevaad se alag koi pahchaan nahin banaai he
 He has a bad habit of resorting to the name of Rama even when he has a little doubt
 aaj kii raajnneeti main vichaardhaara se zyada mahatv vichaaron kaa he or bijepi main modi ko chhodkar aisa koi netaa nahin he jo yuvaaon ke maanas par raaj kar sake
 Even in the pursuit of morality, the party cannot give a clean hand to the UPA with unarmed standing
 dakshin main usne apana akelaa garh bhrashtachar ke kalank main duube bi

 yeddiurppa kii baghawat main kho diya or uski vishwasaneeyata par us samay kutharaghaat hua jab nitin gadakari ne apane rajnatik or kaarobaari hiton main santulan saadhane kii koshish kii
 In terms of economics, the BJP is not so right-wing as to be a comfortable alternative to the Congress
 aisa nahin he ki party ke paas sahi sandarbh kaa abhaav he balki kami aaj kii sachaaiyon kii kasuti par khara utarane kii he
 Opinion polls show that despite the sporadic measures of reforms ranging from food security law to reforms in frustration, there seems to be no way to stop the slippage of Congress in the collapse
 shikhar pad par dow
 The story of Manmohan Singh's ascent does not arouse politically any inspiration
 sanyogvash pradhanmantri bane is shaks ko vyaavhaarik raajnneeti kii kaalikh chhu bhi nahin pai
 He started as a modern leader and by the end of the first term of the UPA, he may have a reputation as a leader who also defeats the anti-imperialist moves of the Marxists
 ve aisa naaraa ban gaye the jisane 2009 ke aam chunaav main congress ko jeet dilaai or duusare kaarykaal main unhone bharat ko ganvaa diya
 In the last five years, Manmohan Singh has been obsessively watching how India broke all records of corruption and scams
 maano ve us sarkaar kaa hissaa nahin the jisane us desh ko lutaa he
 When the country expected trust and accountability from the ministers of the government, the head of the government covered a sheet of silence
 45 pratishat matadaata maanate hai ki unhone kuch nahin kiya jabaki lagbhag aadhe matadaataaon kaa maananaa he ki koyala khanan aavanton ghotaalaa ujagar hote hi unhen istipha de dena chahie tha or 60 pratishat unhen dobaaraa pradhanmantri kii kursi par nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 No honest man should get such a notoriety but Manmohan Singh has earned it and never before in the political history of independent India did such a stigma in the name of a 'good' man be washed away
 2009 kaa anmol hira agle aam chunaav se pehle badanaami kii daldal main gale tak dhans chukaa he
 He has carried such a huge burden of scams and scams that even the noble intentions of the Congress Crown Prince and one of the world's biggest hope of the most durable political dynasty cannot be taken lightly
 congress ke bheetar bhi ladaai jari he
 The fight is between Manmohan Singh's legacy and Rahul Gandhi's future
 viraasat barbaadi or behayaayi kii he, jabaki bhavishya anishchay or anichhaa ke bhavar main ulajhaa hua he
 India's most popular Congressman standing in front of Modi is a truly Gandhian, leaving his party desperate and India confused
 uske liye satta kaa arth pad paanaa nahin balki talash karnaa or kuch nikaalkar laana he
 The name Tilism is still unfolding in front of him and he is not eager to win it even if the party has made him the face of his election campaign
 uske prachaar main acshan kam or chintan zyada he
 Like his mother, Rahul also believes that the power of a leader cannot be measured by his being visible or heard or easily accessible
 ve aise congressi pradhanmantri hai jinhen bharat chahta he (44 pratishat or apane party ke anya netaaon se kahin aage) party ko bhi chauthi peedi ke gandhi kii chhatrachhaaya kii bahut zyada jarurat he lekin gandhi kahin or hai, unki pakad se bahut dur or apni sharton par apane purvajon kii patakatha ko aage badha rahe hai
 He is so immersed in the crisis of his existence that in states like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, he is not even hearing the threat of the end of the party's base
 aise halaat main modi kaa kaam thodaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 His first challenge as the party's campaign head is to take maximum advantage of the Congress sweep in Uttar Pradesh as it is said that this is where the Delhi chair is determined
 agar modi kii jaadui chadi ne rajya main 50 yaa uske aas-paas siten dilaa deen or mulaayam-maaya tilism tod diya to bijepi kaa aankada 200 ke paar hoga or tab ve manachaahe saathi chun sakenge
 If Modi can take bjp's vote percentage around 30 in the state then his national figure could touch 200
 aisa hua to bharat or party puri tarah modi kii mutthi main honge
 Modi's real fight is in the north
 surveykshan ke anusaar, bihar main bhi sambhaavnaaen maujuud hai kyonki nitish kumaar ke dharmanirpekshata ke kile kii deevaaron main daraaren padane lagi hai
 The second challenge is to win friends
 paaramparik soch to yahi kahati he ki modi ke vyaktitv ko dekhte huee apni dharmanirpeksh chhavi ko kaayam rakhane ke liye har keemat par muslim vot paane ko majaboor kattar dharmanirpekshatavaadi unke paas bhi nahin aaenge
 But the history of taking and accompanying in Indian politics tells a different story
 dharmanirpekshata ke kisi pairokaar ne satta par siddhant ko tarjeeh nahin di he
 If BJP crosses the 200 mark, then Modi's friends in the alliance market will not be limited to Jayalalithaa or Naveen Patnaik
 list achaanak lambii ho jaaegi
 An even greater challenge is whether they will be able to take everyone inside and outside the party
 bijepi main har koi atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisaa karishma na rakhte hue bhi unheen ke jaisaa banane kii hasarat paale hue he
 Modi is well aware that he is ahead of bjp's first prime minister in terms of popularity
 phir bhi unke prati sneh se zyada prashansa kaa bhav jaagta he
 Their aggression terrorizes every person
 agar ve itani hi chaturaai se kaam lenge to bijepi ke bheetar zyada dost bana sakenge
 To expand the circle of friends outside the party, they have to find convincing arguments about 2002 Gujarat
 surveykshan ke anusaar bharat chahta he ki ve kshamayachna karen lekin ve ab bhi maanate hai ki kshamayachna kaa arth dosha sweekaar karnaa he
 Great leaders also apologize for the crimes of others and a leader who is in the race to become great can also do so
 apane ‘yas ve can’ ke naare ko gunjyman karne ke liye narendra modi ko dikhaanaa hoga ki ve jis bhavishya kii rachana kaa sapana dikhaa rahe hai us par apane ateet kii kaali chaaya nahin padane denge
 In politics, conscience is also useful and they will not only talk but will also prove to be doing something

 Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Executive Chairman Asif Ali Zardari was sworn in as President at a ceremony held in Islamabad
 is tarah nau saalon ke baad vah desh ke pehle naagarik raashtrapati ban gaye hai
 Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar administered the oath to him
 53 varshiya jaradaari ko pichley saptaah hue raashtrapati chunaav main 70 fisadi vot mili the
 Significantly, Zardari stepped into active politics after the assassination at a rally in Benazir Bhutto last year
 november 2012 main shijinping ne china kii communist party ke mahasachiv kii gaddi sanbhali thi or march 2013 main ve desh ke raashtrapati bane
 Since then, the most significant difference in his work from that of his predecessor Hu Jintao is probably his dealings with the army

 In this way, he came into the very special and unprecedented position of commanding the three parties, government and army together

 piele ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab uskaa puraa prashasan siemasi ke niyantran main aa jayega
 The second major reform was announced on 1 February
 iske tahat china ke sampurna bhubhag main chaaron taraf faili saat lambii-chaudee military aria kaman ko paanch majboot “theatre kaman” yaa yudhakshetra kaman main mila diya gaya (graphic dekhen)
 These five battlefield command will be responsible for the preparations and promptness of the battle and will work directly under the CMC
 pehali baar paanchon yudhakshetron ke liye thal, vaayu or nausena kii ek sanyukt kaman bhi hogi
 Two new forces have also been formed
 inamen ek piele rocket force he, jo second artilari kor kaa unnat rup hogi or china kii mixilon kii dekharekh karegi, or duusari piele stratsic saport force hogi, jisamen jaankaron ke mutabik ek zyada bada sibar yuddh mahakama bhi hoga
 The PLA has been considered as a fighting force to deliver the enemy's sixes, both inside and outside the worn army
 magar uskaa haal kaa itihaas itnaa shandaar nahin he
 His last real experience of war was in 1979 in the fight against Vietnam, in which he had to lick the dust
 tab se piele ne koi badi ladaai nahin ladi he
 But two recent events had tested his ability and filled Beijing's top officials and military observers with restlessness

 Remote areas were affected by the earthquake
 ve prantiy rajdhani chengdu main sthit piele ke vishaal mukhyalay kii pahunch ke puri tarah baahar bhi nahin the
 Despite this, the pla's response was very sluggish and loose, in fact, so inadequate that internal investigations had to be taken up to improve training at all levels
 mushkil se ek saal bhi nahin beetaa tha ki imtihaan kii duusari ghadi aa gai
 In Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, with a majority Muslim population, armed Uygar fighters ravaged the streets

 Official figures say 197 people died, but both Uygar and Chinese believe that the deaths were much larger on both sides

 According to the rules, permission was required to deploy more high-ranking units
 vah kabhi nahin mili
 The disturbances were to the extent that the then President Hu Jintao, who had commanded the PLA as chief of the CMC, had to leave the G20 meeting in Italy midway and run in reverse
 bhitari dushmanunke uttaradhikari shi aisi ghatnaon ke dobaaraa hone dene kaa koi jokhim nahin uthaa rahe hai
 Both Hu and Jiang before them had let the military control the army in the hands of their predecessors for the first few years of power
 hu ke vakt main jiang ritair hone ke baad bhi itane asardaar the ki piele ke ba yi mukhyalay main unka baqayada ek daftar tha or filein unke paas pahunchati thim
 The kind of power that Xi enjoys today, no Chinese leader had received from generations
 iskaa istemaal karne main unhen koi hichak bhi nahin he
 That is why they have been able to make these improvements in the army
 piele kisi bhi duusari fouj kii tarah nahin he
 It does not work for the government or the state
 yah ek rajnatik party ke liye kaam karti he
 The relationship between the Communist Party of China and the PLA is complicated
 piele par niyantran ko lekar party kaa asainya netritv is kadar phikrmand rahata he ki beijing main koi maheenaa nahin gujarata jab aalaa halkon se elaan na kiya jaataa ho ki piele kii vafadari sirf party ke prati hi honi chahie
 Even today, the troops have to sit for hours and get political training and get trained in the principles of Marxism and Mao Tse Tung

 In a way, his loyalty has been bought

 There is a constantly increasing defense budget, which has increased by double digits annually in the last decade and which would have crossed $ 150 billion this year
 is par ab viraam lag jayega
 Construction of new army: PLA officials and experts say that the basic objective of Xi's reforms is double

 The process was started by Xi in September, when he announced a cut of 300,000 soldiers in a powerful army of 2
3 million troops
 siemasi ke maatahat faujee mahakme pehle makasad ke liye kaam karenge, jabaki ye paanchon yudhakshetra kaman ko duusare makasad kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 Zhao Xiaozhuo, a Beijing military expert, states that the intention behind this exercise is to strengthen the hands of the CMC and "establish the party's total dominance over the military"

 Its land was prepared for more than two decades

 The PLA, which was shocked by the demonstrations of the American bombing at the time, transformed its permanent mission
 usne shpiples warya ke mishan ko tilanjali dekar “soochna takneekee (yaa haai-tech) se las halaat main sthaneey yudhon” ko jeetne kaa mishan tay kiya tha
 The PLA has a history of Inquilabi army
 isamen uski khaas aitihaasik bhoomika thi or baaki sevaaon par uskaa khaasaa prabhaav hua karata tha
 In view of this, turning it into a unified army has been a blunt task for the Communist Party
 shi ke sudhaaron se ummid kii ja rahi he ki yah surat badalegi
 PLA expert and professor of political science at MIT, Taylor Fravel says, "think from an organization perspective or from an organization perspective, these reforms are unprecedented
 ye 1950 ke dashak main apanaai gai general staff vyavastha or sainya kshetra ke dhaanche ko jad se mitaate hai
 There is doubt about their success at the moment, but if they are successful, then the fighting power of the army should increase significantly
 ”pehle vaali vyavastha “sanyukt kaman main aadchan paidaa karti thi
 "the main reason behind building ground troops' headquarters and upgrading the Second Artillery into a PLA rocket force is to improve the joint command of the army," says Fravel
 magar in sudhaaron ke kaamyaab amal kii mushkilon par jor dene kii jarurat he
 Such long-term changes are not easy in the organization, so these reforms are going on continuously and the change has just started
 ”shi ke saamne mushkil chunauti he, isamen koi shaq nahin
 But Beijing's thinking is that after decades, they are the only leaders who are in the best position to accomplish this task

 According to Zhang, these red dynasties see both the party and the PLA as their "fatherhood"

 But by modeling and making the Rajasthani album a ladder, she was dreaming of becoming the heroine of Rajasthani films
 lihaaja apane is khwab ko puraa karne ke liye vah kuch bhi kar sakati thi
 She was the same nurse after being taken to the village hospital and she too was missing from duty
 lihaaja gaanv waalon kii shikaayat par bhavari devi ko naukari se suspend kar diya gaya tha
 Bhanwari Devi announced that she had a CD
 jiske baahar aa jane par rajasthan kii sarkaar teen din main gir jaaegi
 After all, what was in that CD that a state government of the country was being threatened to topple? What was it in that secret CD that the leaders' hands and feet were blooming? And what was it that the one who had the CD disappeared? Bhanwari Devi's job was gone
 lekin uski khubsuurati ke charche jodhpur se jaipur tak hone lage the
 She went to the area's MLA Malkhan Singh to save the job
 malakhan, mahipal or bhavarimalakhan singh use jal sansaadhan mantri mahipal maderna ke paas le gaye
 Then both of them recommended Bhanwari Devi to the Collector
 sifarish rang laai or bhavari devi kaa nilamban naa sirf radd hua balki use nai posting apane ghar ke or najadik jaaliwada ke sarkari aspataal main mil gai
 Bhanwari Devi had climbed into the eyes of Malkhan Singh and Mahipal
 vakt ke saath-saath vah in donon kii kareebi ho gai
 After meeting the two leaders, Bhanwari had realized the power of power
 malakhan or maderna kii vajah se uskaa network badhane laga
 Gradually, power, sex and conspiracy met with other leaders as well
 dekhte hi dekhte maamuli tankhwaah paane vaali bhavari kii jindagi puri tarah badal gai
 He built a new house
 nai car kharidi
 Admitted son and daughter in renowned schools
 yah sunne main chaahe kitna hi ajeeb kyon na lage
 But they always have a deep relationship
 or hakeekat bhi yahi he
 Whenever the blot on the drunkards of power is tainted, every time the reality of such a relationship comes out with a new story
 bhavari or sidi kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi thi
 As soon as the blackmailing leaders came to the notice of the ticket, now Bhanwari was completely around the power
 bagaiyr dauty par jaae hi har maheene tankhwaah mil rahi thi
 There was talk about his relationship with Maderna
 lekin maamla satta kaa tha, to sabhi ne chup rahane main bhalaai samajhi
 By the year 2010, Bhanwari enjoyed a lot of power
 par achaanak baat bigadi gai
 Bhanwari's wishes were unbridled
 ab vah malakhan singh or mantri maderna ke saath apane rishton ke evaj main sidhe vidhansabha kaa tikat maang baithi
 Obviously both refused
 sex sidi ke jaal main mantribas isi ke baad bhavari ne rishton ke un palon kii sidi banane kaa faisla kiya
 Minister Maderna got caught in this trap
 bhavari ne donon netaaon ko blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya
 Both immediately made a distance from Bhanwari
 kai maheene tak mantri maderna or vidhayak malakhan singh bhavari se bhaagate rahe
 He kept avoiding Bhanwri
 ek roj wo achaanak bhavari jaipur pahunch gai
 Met some mlas and leaders of BJP
 iske saath hi sab kuch badal gaya
 It is July 2011
 bhavari maderna ke sarkari bangale par pahunch gai
 The deal, made for 60 lakh rupees, Maderna drove him away
 aahat hokar bhavari ne maderna par dabaav banane ke liye jaipur main hi bijepi ke kuch netaaon se mulaakaat kii or unhen pehali baar us sidi ke bare main bataaya
 The news of the CD reached the media via the political corridors of Jaipur
 achaanak mantri mahipal, vidhayak malakhan singh or bhavari devi ke bich tamaam gile-shikave dur ho gaye
 The three were now compromised
 iske baad phir se teenon ke bich baatcheet bhi shuru ho gai thi
 Forced Maderna had promised Bhanwari 60 lakhs in lieu of cds
 
 
 or gaayab ho gai bhavaribhanwari ne agast 2011 main apni car bechi thi
 On September 1, a person named Sohanlal called Bhanwari and called him to his house to pay the same amount of Rs four lakh
 bhavari usee din paise lene ke liye apane ghar se nikali or phir kabhi ghar nahin lauti
 Initially, the family found Bhanwari everywhere
 uske pati ne police main report likhaa di
 Bhanwari Devi's husband Amarchand created a storm in the corridors of power by blaming the cabinet minister of Rajasthan government Mahipal Maderna for the disappearance of his wife
 sibiai ko mila bhavari kesamamla hai profile hone kii vajah se police harakat main aa gai
 The minister and MLA were also under suspicion
 lihaaja police har kadam phoonk phoonk kar rakh rahi thi
 Police found out in the investigation that Bhanwari was last seen in Jodhpur on 1 September
 iske baad uske mobile phone kaa ricard sikar main uski maujuudagi dikhaa rahaa tha
 But no clue was found
 maamla badhata dekh rajya sarkaar ne dabaav main aakar is maamle kii jaanch rajasthan police se lekar sibiai ko saunp di
 The most important question in front of the CBI and the CDC was that who kept Bhanwari in the whirlpool of the CD? What was in that CD? And why did Bhanwari say that the government of Rajasthan would fall in three days if the CD was run? To understand the truth of the CD, it was necessary to know Bhanwari
 ek maamuli nurse bhavari kii asal jindagi main kya haisiyat or rutaba tha use parakhnaa jaruri tha
 And after examining him, the CBI finally reached the destination
 126 din baad khulaa rajgumshudagi ke thik 126 din pataa chalaa ki bhavari devi mar chuki he
 Actually, Sohanlal Bishnoi, who bought a car from Bhanwari, was the nephew of MLA Malkhan Singh
 usne bhavari ko phone kar bataaya tha ki sidi ke badale 60 lakh lene use bilada janaa padegaa
 But the money will get when Raju Bhai will test the reality of the CD
 1 sitambar ko bhavari bas se bilada gai
 There Raju and one of his companions were waiting in a jeep
 ye raju koi or nahin balki khoonkhaar apradhi shahabuddin tha, jo sidi kaa sauda karne aayaa tha
 This was how Bhanwari's murder was now trapped in the woven web of Sohanlal and Shahabuddin
 raju ne gaadi ke sidi player main 52 minute kii puri film dekhi
 Sohanlal was walking in a swift car behind the jeep
 shaam hote hi bhavari ne shahabuddin se paise maange
 But Bhanwari suspects Raju's inattention
 usne shor machaana shuru kar diya
 Seeing this, Sohanlal also came inside the Bullero and these three put Bhanwari under the jeep seat
 or juuton se rond kar bhavari ko maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 The link between such a conspiracy was Sahiram
 vah malakhan singh or mahipal maderna kaa khaas gurga tha
 Which was monitoring this plan of murder from Jyoti Nagar area of jodhpur
 bhavari ke katl ke baad usne sohan laal ko hukum diya ki bhavari kii laash jaloda ke apradhi bishnaram ko saunp de
 So Sohanlal handed over the corpse to Bishnaram Bishnoi in Pipad area
 ab baari thi bhavari kii laash ko thikaane lagane kii lihaaja bishnaram laash ko jaloud ke jangal main luhaavat nahari puliya par le gaya or vahiin laash ko jala diya
 Jail CBI, who went to the minister and MLA, revealed later that the first episode of Bhanwari's murder was MLA Malkhan Singh and the second link was former Cabinet Minister Mahipal Maderna
 bhavari sidi ke jariye mantri maderna ko blackmel kar rahi thi
 In that CD, the minister accompanied Bhanwari Devi in an objectionable condition
 is murder cese se jude sabhi log malakhan or madherna ke log the
 Later Mahipal Maderna had to resign not only from the cabinet
 balki jail bhi janaa padaa
 The same situation happened to Malkhan Singh
 ab yah cese ek baar phir jinda ho uthaa he

 jitibi aspataal main sirf dillivaasiyon ko ilaaj dene ke maamle main dilli hoicourt ne kejariwal sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 The court, while hearing the petition, has issued a notice to the Delhi government and directed to file its reply by Monday
 yachika lagane vaale vakil ashok agarwal kaa kahana he kijitibi aspataalko lekar circular ke aane ke baad dilli ensiaar main shaamil noida, gudgaanv or gajiabad jaisi jagahon se aane vaale local marijon ko jitibi aspataal main ilaaj nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Currently, according to the circular of GTB Hospital, only those who show the voter ID card of Delhi can get medical facilities
 iskaa matlab yah he ki jo bhi vyakti dilli kaa nivasee nahin he usko dilli ke sarkari aspataalon main ilaaj nahin milegaa
 This circular is constantly being opposed and the PIL filed today should be stayed on the circular requested by the Delhi High Court
 is bich dilli sarkaar ke vakil ne kaha ki is maamle main vah bhi apana paksh rakhana chaahate hai ki unhone is tarah kaa circular jitibi aspataal main kyon jari kiya he
 It was said on behalf of the Delhi government that at the moment anyone can enroll in emergency services
 yah circular sirf jitibi aspataal main dilli ke marijon ko kota dene ke liye jari kiya gaya he
 Which gives priority to those patients who are from Delhi
 philhal is maamle main dilli hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar ko notice jari kar diya he
 However, what will be the government's answer in the court in this matter till Monday will be very important
 kyonki agar sarkaar court ko ye samajhane main kaamyaab rahi ki ye circular dilli kii bhalaai ke liye he to mumkin he ki dilli sarkaar baaki ke sarkari aspataalon main bhi isi tarah ke circular jari kar de
 If the court found this circular to be unnecessary, then it is possible that the court should stop this circular of the Health Department of the Delhi government

 whats ap par viral ho rahi is tasviir ke saath yah daawa kiya ja rahaa he kishahrukhki yah tasviir mumbai ke 'brich candi' hospital main unakisurgerike dauraan clic kii gai he

 istaswirko lekar kuch logon kaa kahana he yah bhi kahana he ki yah tasviir photoshop kii gai he jisamen yah dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki superstar shahrukh kuch saal baad kaise najar aaenge
 It is true that Shahrukh is the only one in this picture but this is not his real look

 gujarat kii siyaasi baaji ek baar bijepi ke naam rahi
 The BJP dominated central Gujarat, known for cooperatives and milk production
 bijepi ne apni seat bachaai hi nahin, balki pichley chunaav se behatar nateeja hasil kiya he
 The Congress has also failed to save the earlier seat
 rajya ke madhya kshetra main congress ko do siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 The BJP got more seats than before, out of 182 seats in Gujarat, 40 seats come from central Gujarat
 is siton main se bijepi ne 23 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi, vahiin congress ke khate main 16 siten gai hai
 Whereas in the last election 2012, there has been a fight between the two parties
 madhya gujarat kii 40 siton main se 22 par bijepi ne jeet darj kii or congress ko 18 siten hasil kii thim
 This time the Congress has lost 2 seats
 madhya gujarat main ahmedabad, dahod, kheda, aanand, panchmahal, vadodara jile aate hai
 Of these, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are strong bastions of the BJP
 ye donon jile shahari kshetra main hai
 Like the previous elections, this time the BJP has spread its foot in rural areas along with winning the urban seats
 in jilon main kisi mili kitni sitechhmadabad jile main 15 bijepi or 6 congress ko mili he
 Vadodara BJP has got 8 seats and Congress has got 2 seats
 panchmahal kii chaar paanch siton main se 3 bijepi, 1 congress or 1 anya ko mili he
 Anand has got 2 BJP and 3 Congress
 jabaki pichley chunaav main ahmedabad kii 21 siton main bijepi ne 17 to 4 congress siten jiti thi
 Koli, the Sanjeevani Madhyam Gujarat formed for the OBC BJP, is dominated by businessmen, Patidars, obcs and Koli community votes
 patidaaron kii naaraazgi ko bijepi ne obisi or coli samaaj ko apane saath jodakar nuksaan kii bharpai kii he
 While the impact on unemployment-trading, including the Patidar reservation movement in central Gujarat, was vivid, the issue of debt waiver of farmers was overshadowed
 iske baavjood bijepi apni baavshaahiyat ko bachaane main safal rahi he
 At the same time, where the Congress has benefited in the urban seats, then it has suffered a big loss in the rural areas

 His nymph wife Lalitha was very sad

 Then a sage advised Lalitha to keep Kamada Ekadashi fast
 lalita ne muni ke ashram main ekadshi vrath kaa paalan kiya or is vrath kaa punya laabh apane pati ko de diya
 With the power of the vow, Lalit was freed from his demon form and again became a beautiful singer Gandharva

 This is the first time in the history of the Man Booker Prize that an American has won this award
 is varsh paul beati ne yah puraskaar jeeta he
 He has been awarded the Man Booker Award this year for his novel 'the Sellout'
 paul kii umr 54 saal he or ve los angelis main paidaa hue the
 He also teaches at Columbia University in the United States
 'da selout' ko mana ja rahaa he kataaksh
 
 
 Experts in the judging panel of the Man Booker Prize believe that Paul's novelty is a sarcasm of contemporary racial politics in America
 ve bahut hi sadhe andaaj main sabaki khabar lete hai or pataa tak chalane nahin dete
 His writing has an amazing ability to keep readers engaged from beginning to end
 aasaan nahin tha safar
 
 
 Today, even though the whole world is being laughed at by Paul's handwriting, it was not always so
 america jaise desh main jahaan nasl or varg kii raajnneeti haaavee rahati ho vahaan apni kalpanaaon ko kaagaj par utaarna aasaan nahin tha
 To fight segregation and slavery was to resort to pen and always alert to your african-american identity like walking on the edge of the sword
 gudagudi or dard saath-saath
 
 
 Those familiar with Paul's writing say that they give up everything with the help of words
 unki lekhnee jahaan logon ko kisi vaktchehare par muskanalaati he to vahiin duusare pal maayoos kar jaati he
 Despite this, his book is gaining reputation as a satire all over the world
 ve use vyangy ke bajaay hakeekat kaa dastavej maanate hai
 His teachers expressed disappointment
 
 
 aaj bhale hi paul ko puri duniya unke dwaara likhi gai kitaab ke liye jaanane lagi ho, lekin kabhi unke college ke prophessoron ne unhen likhane se manaa kiya tha
 a professor in his college said that he does not write well
 ve lekh ke taur par kabhi safal nahin honge
 Apart from this, he is also a perfectionist in his personal life
 ve kisi bhi cheez yaa kaam se jald hi bor ho jate hai
 On receiving this award, he says, 'I don't want to be dramatic, as if writing has saved my life
 
 
 lekin likhane ne mujhe ek jindagi jarur di he'
 They consider writing to be a difficult task and they also dislike writing

 com / cpynmdhmbz— dpa international (@dpa_intl)october 26, 2016 a week after the death of 11 security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir and a day before the anniversary of the attack on Parliament, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said that the terrorists had come from Pakistan and tried to curb such 'reckless efforts' by India
 Will have to give a 'befitting reply'
 raksha mantri ne guuruuvaar ko kashmir kaa daura kiya tha
 He said that the situation will change within six months, as the government has planned several steps in this regard
 haalanki unhone is silsile main vistaar se jaankaree nahin di
 He said, "I think a befitting reply should be given, which will prevent such a futile attempt forever and or at least reduce them
" yah ek khulaa rahasy he ki ve (aatankwaadi) pakistan se aae the
 You will see a change in the next six months
 raksha mantri is sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the ki kya kashmir ghati main aatankwaadiyon ke hamalon ke prati bharat ke jawaab kargar hai? unhone kaha ki unki pehali praathamikta jammu-kashmir main vatan kii hifaazat kar rahe sashastr balon ko uchit sazosaman or samarthan muhaiyaa karana he
 He was reminded that Pakistan has nuclear power and how the Indian government can respond effectively, the Defense Minister said, "nuclear power tells us to exercise restraint
" raksha mantri ne kaha, main purna yuddh kii baat nahin kar rahaa
 Complete war is a completely different thing, but if there are some places from which terrorists come and go, there are people who do so

 bharat ne pichley saal disambar main agni-5 antaramahadwipiya prakshepan missile kaa pareekshan kiya
 With a capacity of up to 5,000 km, this missile has the capability to hit Beijing and beyond
 uske turant baad china kii gopneey piples libration army rocket force (pielref) ne utana hi ahm pareekshan kiya
 But nothing was allowed to be made public
 janvari main beijing main kootnithik halkon main charchaa garm thi ki pielref ne pehali baar ek multiple independently targeteble rientry vehical (emiarvi) kaa pareekshan kiya he jise ek deef-5si antaramahadwipiya prakshepan missile se choda gaya
 There were at least ten weapons on it
 isse pehle tak kai visheshgyon kaa yah maananaa tha ki china ke paas isaki kshamta nahin thi
 That alleged test is of considerable importance as it indicated that China was rapidly increasing its nuclear armament reserves as would be needed for a ten-armed MIRV capability
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki yah pareekshan aisa khatra he jise sab nazarandaaj karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It is also the reason for the continuing increase in mistrust in India's relations with China
 donon hi teji se paaramparik or parmaanu pratirohak kshamtaayen hasil karne main lage hai, bhale hi china ke saamne bharat kaa bhandar philhal bouna ho
 What is important and worrying is that this issue does not figure in any level of dialogue between the two countries
 chini adhikariyon or visheshgyon ke anusaar isaki vajah yah he ki china ab bhi bharat ko ek ''avaidhya parmaanu takat maanata he or is par koi bhi baatcheet uske hisaab se bharat kii haisiyat ko ''vaidhaniktaa" dene ke baraabar hogi
 China's secretive second artillery corps has held the Chinese military's conventional and nuclear missiles under its control for five decades
 vah gupachup kaam karne main garv mahasoos karti he
 In 1966, it took two decades for the existence of this core to be officially acknowledged publicly
 vaise china main ''er paao" ke naam se pahachaane jane vaale is bal ne haal ke maheenon main dhime-dhime khud ko roshni main laana shuru kiya he
 This is probably due to the attitude of China led by President Xi Jinping to show its strength
 emiarvi pareekshan ke li ho jane ke baad artilari kor ne, pichley saal shi ke sainya sudhaaron kii yojana ke tahat jiskaa naam badalakar pielref kar diya gaya tha, pehali baar ek video jari kiya jisamen uske sainikon ko deef-16 madhyam duuri kii belistic mixilon par kaam karte dikhaaya gaya tha
 Chinese media indicated that the missile could reach all of China's neighbors, from Japan to India and the Philippines
 usee maheene ek anya aadhunik antaramahadwipiya belistic missile deef-41 ke photo jari kiye gaye jise rus or uttar korea ke paas china kii uttar-purvi seemaa par tainaat kiya ja rahaa tha
 This would have brought the west coast of America under his control
 li hui anya report main sanket miltaa tha ki use sambhawatah bharat or madhya asia kii seemaa par shinjiyang main bhi tainaat kiya ja rahaa tha
 All these developments of the entity keeping itself confidential were unusual and in September there was another huge gathering in the PLARF
 shi ke sudhaaron ke tahat duusari topakhana kor ko pronnat karke sena, nausena or vaayu sena ke samakaksh sena kii ek swatantra chauthi ikai kaa darja de diya gaya
 In the same month Xi addressed his top officials that he was China's "main strategic deterrent"
 pielref ke badlaav kaa bharat par bhi asar padegaa
 Even though it is linked to China's nuclear weapons stock, the stock of a few hundred nuclear weapons is actually the same as the six thousand conventional missile stocks that the core occupies

 Each and every location of this area, including Pangong Lake and five other lakes, has been made into reality in the same way in North China so that the Chinese army can position itself for any fighting situation in that area with India
 To prepare completely
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki pielref kaa apni takat dikhaane kaa ek makasad uski haal kii takneekee tarakkee bhi he
 There is no strategic nuclear dialogue between India and China
 aisa is vajah se he ki china bharat ko parmaanu hathiyaar sampann takat nahin maanata kyonki bharat ne parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) par dastakhat nahin kiye hai
 "I don't see any problem with such talks," says Shen Dingli Shen, an expert on China's nuclear deterrents
 vaise aadhikarik niti yah he ki bharat enpiti ke anusaar ek ''vaidhanik" parmaanu hathiyaar sampann desh nahin he, so china us bare main baat karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 "this policy makes clear China's response to India's fourth test of Agni-5 in December
 beijing ne pareekshan kii aalochana karte hue sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 1998 ke abadhyakaari prastaav sankhya 1172 ko uddhrut kiya tha jisamen bharat or pakistan, donon se kaha gaya tha ki ve apane parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad parmaanu hathiyaaron ko le jane main sakasham belistic mixilon kaa pareekshan bhi band kar den
 Shen said, "china's view is that this test violates the UN resolution and therefore it is illegal
 china bharat se baat nahin karegaa varanaa isse bharat ke avaidhanik kadamon ko vaidhaniktaa mil jaaegi
 "however, the fear of this uneasy silence is that the two countries will only increase their respective stockpiles in the fear of evil

 Actress Priya Prakash Warrier, who was in the headlines overnight on social media, is once again in the headlines
 ve film shridevi bangalo se apane bollywood kariyar kii shuruuaat karne ja rahi hai
 However, his first film itself has come under controversy as there are some scenes in the trailer of the film which seem to have tried to ridicule the famous actress Sridevi in the film
 is film main priya kaa naam bhi shridevi he
 Seeing the escalation of the controversy, the film's director Prashant Mambuli has clarified the matter
 unhone kaha ki south main shridevi ek saamaanya naam he
 On the other hand, Priya said that her only character's name is Sridevi and the makers of the film do not want to create any controversy
 unhone kaha, 'film main mere kairactor kaa naam shridevi he
 After all, why would anyone want to raise such a dispute? i think people are very excited about the trailer of the film and we should leave it to the audience whether the film is based on Sridevi Maam or not
 haalanki shridevi ke pati boni kapur is film se khafa chal rahe hai
 He has sent legal notices to the film's director Prashanth Mambuli
 report ke mutabik, boni kapur is film ko release nahin hone dena chaahate hai
 Recently, Sridevi's daughter Jahnavi Kapoor was also asked a question about Priya Prakash Warrier's film 'sridevi Bangla', although the 21-year-old actress had ignored the question
 kuch hi der main unke manager vahaan pahunche or unhone media discshan ko khatm kara diya tha

 What is the truth in this news, in fact, huge amounts are being made viral through fake news and rumor whatsapp
 isaki vajah se desh main mob linching bhi ho gai he
 To stop this, the government is pressuring whatsapp to find out where fake news and rumors are being spread
 lekin watsap apni policy kii vajah se aisa nahin kar saktaa he
 whatsapp has already refused to do so
 darasal watsap ke communication head karl vung ne ek statement jari kiya he
 News agency IANS has given this statement
 haalanki is bayaan main bhi unhone ye nahin kaha he ki watsap bharat se band hone ja rahaa he
 His statement is, 'the suggested changes are not possible due to strong privacy protection
 and tu and encripshan kii vajah se aisa sambhav nahin he
 It cannot be determined what will come next
 karl vung ne IANS se kaha he, 'propose kiye gaye regaullation main, ek cheez massej tres karne kii baat bhi he jo hamaare liye chintajanak he
 He said that whatsapp is end to end encrypted by default
 matlab ye ki sender or risiver ke alaava koi teesraa in massej ko na to tres kar saktaa he or na hi pard saktaa he
 Even whatsapp is not possible for users to read messages
 karl vung ne kaha he ki and tu and ancripshan feechar ke bina whatsapp puri tarah se ek nayaa product ban jayega
 Apart from this, he has also said that under this regulation, whatsapp will have to be re-architected, if this happens then whatsapp will not remain the same
 kul mila kar karl vung kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki watsap ke liye sender ko tres karnaa asambhav he or wo aisa karnaa bhi nahin chaahati he
 Doing so can cause Identity Crisis with whatsapp
 inhone haalanki kuch nayaa nahin kaha he, massej kaa origin tres karne ke bare main watsap ne pehle bhi isi tarah kii baat kahi he
 The benefits of end to end encryption are for the users, but there are some disadvantages to the Law Enforcement Agency
 kyonki isaki vajah se galat jaankariyaan, phek news or afvaah failaane vaale pakad main nahin aa sakate hai
 The IT ministry has proposed a guideline for social media companies, which include an exercise to stop such messages
 kul mila kar baat ye he ki watsap bharat se nahin janaa vaala

 In Uttar Pradesh, most of the mps including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have adopted villages where the Muslim population is either there and if it is not, under the MP Adarsh gram Yojana
 uma bharti, calraj mishra, yogi adityanath, sanjeev baalion or yahaan tak kii party ke muslim chehre mukhtaar abbaas nakvi dwaara god liye gaanvon main muslim aabaadi nahin he
 In the adopted villages of Rajnath Singh and Varun Gandhi, the Muslim population is less than half per cent
 vaise to banaras main 10 lakh muslim rahete hai, lekin desh ke pradhanmantri ne jo gaanv god liya, usamen koi muslim nahin rahata he
 It is the stronghold of the RSS and for the last 35 years it has an RSS wing
 aresas is gaanv ko piem dwaara god liye jane se 12 saal pehle god le chukaa he
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh adopted Benti village of Lucknow, then happily in the village at hour and hour
 rafique is gaanv main utane hi 'alpsankhyak' hai, jitne bijepi main mukhtaar abbaas nakvi
 Rafiq and his brothers are the only Muslims in a population of 15 thousand
 gaanv main bhale or muslim na hon, lekin benti gaanv kaa naam hi ek sufi fakir benti shah baba ke naam par padaa he
 His tomb is now to be destroyed
 rafique se jab hamane poocha ki aap rajnath ji se kya chaahate hai, to unhone kaha, yah majaar tuuti-phooti padi he, chamatkaari ho jaae
 
 
 If it is built, people will come from far and wide
 gaanv ke log bhi chaahate hai ki majaar thik ho jaae
 Rajnath Singh has been the Chief Minister of UP, and his image is not that of a discriminatory leader, then we assume that it is a coincidence, but the question is that in the villages adopted by most of the BJP mps, this coincidence Is going
 upi kii 13 loksabhaa siton par muslim aabaadi 30-52 fisadi tak he
 Surprisingly, even in the villages adopted by the BJP mps in those seats, Muslims are either not, or are not equal
 bahut kam aise gaanv god liye gaye hai, jahaan muslim aabaadi najar aati he
 The Muzaffarnagar seat, for example, has a Muslim population of 37 per cent, but there is no Muslim in Rasulpur village of MP Sanjeev Balian
 rampur main 52 fisadi muslim hai, lekin mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ke manpur ojha gaanv main koi muslim nahin he
 About 39 per cent of Muslims are in Kairana, but there is none in Sukhedi village of Hukum Singh
 sanbhal main kareeb 46 fisadi muslim hai, lekin saansad satyapal singh ke laharaawaan gaanv main sirf 1
 33 percent are Muslim
 shravasti main 32 fisadi muslim hai, lekin daddan mishra ke jayachandpur gaanv main 2
 33 percent are Muslim
 saharanpur main 39 fisadi muslim hai, lekin raghav lakhanpal ke khushhalipur gaanv main sirf 3
 Muslims constitute 5%
 meerut main 31 fisadi musalmaan hai, lekin saansad rajendra agarwal dwaara god liye bhagavanpur gaanv main sirf 3
 75 percent are Muslim
 bijepi ke duusare bade netaaon uma bharti, calraj mishra or yogi aditnyath ne bhi aise gaanv god liye hai, jinamein ek bhi muslim nahin hai
 But the BJP says it is a coincidence
 upi bijepi ke pravaktaa vijay pathak kehete hai, aap isko ek ittefaq bhi maan sakate hai ki swaabhaavik rup se raay ai or lottery main jo gaanv niklaa use chayan karnaa hi tha
 Now incidentally, what was his population, what was the situation, that is different

 The Prime Minister may not yet publicly accept the fake cow vigilant attack on Muslims, but he has accepted the oppression of Dalits with a high degree of sentimentality
 itani acchhee bhavukta to aajkal filmon main bhi dekhne ko nahin milti
 However, on this occasion one should remember Mahatma Gandhi's speech on August 8, 1942 at the All India Congress Committee in Bombay
 yahi vah bhaashan tha jiske ant main ‘karenge yaa marenge’ kaa naaraa niklaa or ant main aazaadee kii ladaai aazaadee kii choukhat tak pahunchi
 If this speech started with rebuke to the communists, a large part was in convincing the Muslims that this country is an equal country, so they should not support Pakistan's illegitimate demand
 or musalamaanon ko yah baat samajhane ke liegandhijie goraksha kii misaal bhi di
 It was due to that angel that he called Khilafat and Goraksha as two sides of the same coin
 dakshin africa main gandhiji ke the muslim or parsi dostjra bhaashan ke is ansh par gaur karen, 'hajaaron musalmaan mujhase kehete hai ki agar hindu-musalmaan kaa sawaal pakke taur par suljhaayaa janaa he, to ise mere jite ji sulajhaa liya janaa chahie
 Although i should be happy on this point, but how can i accept such an experience which i do not understand? hindu-muslim unity is not a new thing
 karodon hindu-musalmaan yahi chaahate hai
 i have been engaged in this work since my childhood
 jab main skool main padhata tha, tab maine is baat kii khaas koshish kii ki musalmaan or parsiyon se meri dosti ho
 i was confident even at that young age that if the Hindus of India wanted to live in peace with other communities, they would have to instill a sense of brotherhood
 
 
 dakshin africa main bhi maine musalmaan or parsi dost banaae
 And finally when he returned to India, he was saddened by my departure, he had tears in his eyes
 ekta se khilaafat andolan ke liye hue preritabharat main bhi maine yahi ekta hasil karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Unity was my desire for life and this inspired me to support Muslims in Khilafat movement
 musalamaanon ne puure desh main mujhe apana sachcha dost mana
 Gandhiji had said - i am a cow worshiper, then what happened today that today (for Muslims) i became Satan and distasteful
 kya khilaafat andolan kii hindu-muslim ekta maine kisi farse ke jor par hasil kii thi
 The truth is that my interpreter used to say that by doing this i will also be able to do mangoraksha
 main go-poojak hum
 i maintain that i and the cow are children of the same God
 gaay ke praanon kii raksha ke liye main apane praan nyochhaavar karne ko taiyaar hum
 My life philosophy and my ultimate hopes may be anything, but i was not attached to any intention of bargaining with the Khilafat movement
 khilaafat andolan se main isliye judaa taaki sankat kii ghadi main main apane padosi ke saath khadaa ho sakuun
 If the Ali brothers were alive today, they would have given evidence of the truth of my talk
 or bahut se log yah bhi bataate kii maine yah kaam gaay kaa jivan bachaane ke liye molbhav ke taur par nahin kiya tha
 The importance of both the cow and the caliphate is based on their own merits
 ek eemaandaar aadmi, sachche padosi or vafaadaar dost ke naate yah lazim tha ki gadhe vakt main main musalamaanon ke saath khadaa houn
 'many lessons learned in this lesson
 In this speech further, strong words were used for Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the commitment to work for the Dalit interests was reiterated
 vaise gaay ko lekar gandhi ji ke ye vichaar itane spasht hai ki unhen or saaf karne kii koi jarurat nahin he, phir bhi itnaa kah luun to bahut zyada brudabi nahin hogi ki baapu yahi samajha rahe the ki agar vah musalamaanon ko apana dost bana lenge, unka dil jeet lenge or unke gadhe vakt main kandhe se kandhaa milakar khadey ho jaaenge to aakhir ko musalmaan bhi goseva main unke saath aa jaaenge
 Yes, also remember that Gandhi was talking of putting his life at stake to protect the cow, not to kill anyone

 kanpur raily me aam aadmi party kii taraf se bahut saaf sanket mili ki agar bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi varanasi se loksabhaa chunaav ladate hai to arvind kejariwal bhi varanasi se maidan main honge
 Kejriwal himself said that he previously felt that there is a wave of Modi name in the country, but the kind of public support he got during the roadshow has broken his myth and now from March 5 to March 8, he will go to Gujarat and see 'ram Where did the kingdom come? lekin isse bhi badi baat kejariwal ne is sabha main yah kahi ki unki party in loksabhaa chunaavon main congress se zyada siten lekar aegi
 He also claimed that the next government at the Center would not form without the support of the Aam Aadmi Party
 ab jaraa gaur se dekhen ki kejariwal ke in do daavon ke peeche manshaa kya he? jab unki party kejariwal ko modi se ladaane kii baat kahati he yaa ve daawa karte hai ki unki party congress se zyada siten laaegi to unka iraadaa kya hota he? In fact, Kejriwal's attempt is to create the impression that in these elections, he is his own party compared to BJP and not Congress
 duusare, vah yah jataana chaahate hai ki aam aadmi party in loksabhaa chunaavon main duusari sabase badi party ke taur par ubharne vaali he, is ummid main ki isse shaayad un virgon or tabakon kaa samarthan unhen mil jaae, jo bijepi yaa narendra modi ko satta main aate dekhne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 But this verdict is nothing short of a double-edged sword, as the message can also be that Kejriwal has only one agenda and that is to stop Modi from becoming Prime Minister, this may further intensify the accusations that Kejriwal and the Congress will give Modi Got to stop
 aapako yaad dilaa duun ki dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main bahut saare log aise the, jo kehete the ki vah dilli main kejariwal ko vot denge, lekin baaki desh ke liye modi ko- yani kejariwal ko ve dilli kaa mukhyamantri dekhnaa chaahate the or modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri
 
 
 In such a situation, the party is also making an assessment of how beneficial this bet of Kejriwal will be and hence it is waiting for where Modi contests elections
 kejariwal kaa yah daawa bhi dhyaan dene laayak he ki agali sarkaar aap ke bina nahin banegi
 Whereas this is the party which has so far shown itself against some kind of coalition politics
 kahati rahi he ki vah na samarthan legi or na samarthan degi
 The party used to say this since its birth
 ab jaraa is samarthan kii baat ko thodaa kholane kii koshish karen to najar aata he ki aam aadmi party kii sabase badi dushman bijepi he
 In such a situation, after the election, if needed, can she form or form a government by supporting or taking the Congress? is atkal ko is baat se bhi hawa milegi ki dilli main aam aadmi party kii pehali sarkaar congress ke samarthan se hi bani thi
 Then how will this party win the anti-congress vote? is party kaa asli janaadhar hi congress virodh tha, kyonki dilli or desh main congress kii hi sarkaar thi, jiskaa virodh lokapal bill ko lekar ek andolan ke rup main saamne aayaa or baad main ek raajnneetik dal main tabdeel ho gaya or dilli main congress kaa safaya ho gaya
 In such a situation, Kejriwal's current plan, his statement and intentions appear dangerous for his politics, but it has to be kept in mind that in politics, time changes rapidly and accordingly decisions and strategies are made

 ek taraf jahaan infosis board company ke liye nae siio or emdi kii talash kar rahaa he vahiin board ke kuch sadasyon ne istipha dene kaa peshkash kii he
 An English TV channel has claimed that all others, including board members, have offered to resign from the board
 yah peshkash isliye kii gai he jisase company ke nae siio or emdi ke taur par nandan nilekani kaa infosis main nai pari shuru karne kaa rasta saaf ho sake
 According to sources, Nandan Nilekani has agreed to take over the command of Infosys on the condition that he be given a clean slate under the command of the company so that old disputes do not come up before the new management
 nilekani kaa maananaa he ki companiko tej raftaar dene ke liye jaruri he ki ek baar phir company main inwaster kaa rujhaan majboot ho or karmchaariyon ke liye company kaa maahaul behatar rahe
 It is worth noting that Nandan Nilekani took the command of the chairman of UIDAI in 2009 to start the base scheme of Manmohan Singh Sarkar at the center except Infosys
 2009 main infosis chhodte vakt nilekani ne kaha tha ki vah waapas infosis kaa rukh nahin karengen
 But after the ongoing struggle in Infosys for the last few months and the resignation of Vishal Sikka, the company was forced by the chairman and independent directors to take over the reins from Nilekani
 nandan nilekani kii vaapasi kaa matlab he infosis board kaa nae sire se punargathan kiya jayega
 Sources believe that the members who are not expected to make a place in the new board may resign from the board
 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad se samaajawaadee party kaa janaadhar or mulaayam kunbe kaa raajnneetik bhavishya kathin daur se guzar rahaa he
 Despite this, the check-up game between Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav continues
 kehete hai ki duubate jahaaj main agar lutpaat or dangal shuru ho jaae to vah or teji se duubataa he
 This is more or less the situation of Samajwadi Party
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle akhilesh ne chachaa ramgopal yadav ke saath milakar shivpal ko thikaane lagaaya
 Not only this, he also took command of the party in his own hands
 iske baad se shivpal mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko raajnneetik maat dene kii kavayad kar rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unka sapana saakaar nahin ho sakaa he
 Significantly, before the assembly elections, the battle of Mulayam Singh's courtyard still continues unchanged
 jabaki chachaa bhattije kii kadavaahat ke chalate hi espi ko upi kii satta ko ganvaani padi he
 Even after this, Shivpal and Akhilesh do not miss the opportunity to beat each other
 akhilesh ne chunaav ke baad sanghathan se shivpal parast logon ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he
 The party is now completely Akhileshmay
 shivpal lagaataar mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko target par lete rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 Ever since the Assembly election debacle, Shivpal has been publicly saying that the party should be given the command of Mulayam Singh Yadav, but Akhilesh has clearly said that he is and will remain the president of the party
 party kii kaman kisi ko nahin denge
 Not only this, in order to put pressure on Akhilesh, he also chanted the formation of a separate party
 par akhilesh ke iraade main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 After this news came that Shivpal can go to BJP camp
 is par bhi akhilesh khamoshi akhriyaar kiye rahe
 Shivpal is constantly laying his political board with the help of Mulayam
 shivpal ko ummid he ki mulaayam ke sahare wo apni raajnneetik naiya paar laga lenge
 That is why time and time again they say that they will unite the socialists and form a secular front, which will be headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav
 shivpal gut kaa kambaikaspa sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne mangalvaar ko lohia trust karyaalay main hui baithak main bada faisla lete hue akhilesh ke kareebi chaar sadasyon ko trust se bedakhal kar diya
 Members removed by Nateaji are Ram Govind Chaudhary, Usha Verma, Ashok Shakya and Ahmed Hassan
 ye sabhi sadsy akhilesh yadav ke kareebi hai
 SP Patron Mulayam Singh replaced four members of Shivpal as members instead of these four members
 inamen deepak mishra,ram naresh yadav,ram sevak yadav or rajesh yadav sadsy banaaye gaye
 While the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav did not attend the meeting of Lohia Trust on Tuesday
 baithak ke baad shivpal yadav ne kaha ki philhal trust main vahi rahegaa jo lohia hit main kaam karegaa
 When Akhilesh and Ram Gopal were not involved in the meeting, Shivpal said that the information of the meeting was given to everyone, maybe some work has been done
 vahiin akhilesh yadav ko trust kaa mukhiya banane kii chal rahi charchaa koshivpal yadavane sire se khaarij kar diya
 Shivpal Yadav said that the chairman of the trust is Netaji and will remain there
 ham log party ko majboot or ekajute karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Akhilesh Yadav's recovery plan Akhilesh Yadav has been working towards reviving the party since the 2017 assembly election defeat
 april ke maheene se hi party main nae sadsy banane kaa abhiyaan chalaaya
 Apart from this, he planned a new team of party spokespersons, in which all the youth and close to Akhilesh got a place
 itnaa hi nahin agast kranti ke maukey akhilesh ne 'desh bachaao-desh banaao' abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya, jiske jariye akhilesh ne centre kii modi or soobe kii yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf bigul foonka
 Akhilesh is going to organize the first national conference of the party in the end of September, in which he will place his young colleagues from the national organization to the state organization, so that the political battle of 2019 can prevail

 The court should look into the Shariat by ending three divorces

 aise main sarkaar is prakriya ko apanaati he to ham swaagat karte hai lekin sarkaar agarshariyat ke khilaaf koi kanoon laate hai, to hamen kubul nahin he
 We demand from the government that the Muslim Marriage Act should be made on the lines of Hindu Marriage Act
 taaki muslim mahilaon kii jindagi coke saath kisi tarah khilwaad na ho sake
 It has often been seen that after divorce, the case goes on in the family court and the man rejoices by marrying another
 aise main agar hindu marij act kii tarah muslim marij act banegaa to ye aasaan nahin hoga

 One country with the intention of one tax, VP Singh, who was the first Finance Minister in Rajiv Gandhi's government, introduced Modified VAT (MODVAT) in February 1986

 (bhashaa se input) Soon after the farmers' movement started in Madhya Pradesh, the government decided to buy some crops at a support price, including onions
 lekin ab yah pyaaj sarkaar ke liye musiibat banati ja rahaa he
 Generally, there is no system of storage of onions in government stores because the government does not buy fruits and vegetables
 aise main is baar bhi kai ton pyaaj kharid ke baad barbaad ho gai
 This time there was a bumper yield of onions in Pyarelal fields of Hitori
 kuch pyaaj april main bech liya kuch sarkaar ke aath rupee prati kilo pyaaj kharidne ke elaan ke baad bhi bik gai
 Nevertheless, 7-8 tonnes of onion was wasted
 pyarelal ko lagbhag 2 xxrep 4 0 kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 Pyarelal, who came to the Karaund mandi, said that my onion was rotting, spoiled, will not even sell
 let laae, number main lage rahe
 
 
 The number in the fork, but the token could not be found
 akele bhopal kii karaund mandi main hi 8000 ton pyaaj sad gai
 In some, seedlings came out, many sacks got insects
 mandi main nai paidaavaar nahin aa rahi
 The fine produce from the old is being sorted and kept aside
 tippaniyan The government had plans to purchase eight lakh metric tonnes of onions
 kharid lagbhag puri bhi ho gai
 Yogesh Joshi, general manager of Markfed, engaged in the procurement of onions, said that about 7, 82,000 MT of onions have been purchased, but the government has directed that till June 30, tokens will be bought from those who have given them tokens
 haalanki sarkaar khud maanati he ki uske paas pyaaj ke bhandaaran kii vyavastha na ke baraabar he
 The effort is to sell the purchase as soon as possible
 civil supplai corporation ke adhyaksh dow hitesh vaajapeyi ne mana ki bhandaaran kii suvidha nahin he
 Because of this, onion is not a regular commodity
 shaskeey kharid nahin hoti thi
 We can understand our loss
 saadhe teen lakh dyspos kiya he, dhai lakh bik gaya he
 Now the rate is also getting 3-4 rupees
 pichley saal sarkaar ne ek lakh metric ton pyaaj lagbhag sava sau karod main kharidi thi
 This onion got rotten
 isse sarkari khajaane ko 100 karod kaa nuksaan hua
 This time eight lakh metric tons of onions have been purchased at a cost of 500 crores
 isamen se lagbhag aadhi pyaaj is baar bhi upabhokta tak pahunchane se pehle barbaad hogi, yah tay he

 However, the government itself believes that it has little system of onion storage
 koshish yahi he ki kharid ko jald se jald bechaa jaae
 President of Civil Supplies Corporation, Dr
 Hitesh Vajpayee admitted that there is no storage facility
 iskaa kaaran, pyaaj regular camodity nahin he
 There was no official purchase
 ham samaj sakate hai hamaara nuksaan he
 Disposed three and a half million, two and a half million have been sold
 ab rate bhi 3-4 rupee tak mil rahaa he
 Last year, the government had purchased one lakh metric tonnes of onions for about 125 crore rupees
 yah pyaaj sad gai
 This caused a loss of 100 crores to the exchequer
 is baar aath lakh metric ton pyaaj 500 karod kharch karke kharidi ja chuki he
 About half of this onion will be wasted before reaching the consumer this time too, it is certain
