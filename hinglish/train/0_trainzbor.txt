 isisi ranking main number 1 gendbaaj aar aswin har match main records kii barish kar rahe hai
 He also completed his 200 wickets on Indian soil in the second Test against Australia recently
 iske saath hi unhone test cricket main sabase tej 25 baar ek pari main 5 wicket lene kaa bhi karnama kiya
 Ashwin has been making the world's biggest batsmen on his balls continuously for some time
 agar aswin kaa ye shandaar pradarshan jari rahaa to wo kai or records apane naam kar sakate hai
 We are going to tell you, what are the records that Ashwin can break with his spin
 
 
 ek siries main sabase zyaada wicket lene kaa recordgar baat kii jaae ek siries main sabase zyada wicket lene ke world record kii to vah england ke diggaj gendbaaz sidney barnes ke naam he
 Who made the world record of taking 49 wickets in the most series of four Test matches against South Africa in 1913-14
 ek siries main sabase zyada wicket lene kaa bhartiya record leg spinner bhagavat chandrashekhar ke naam he, jinhone 1973-74 main england ke khilaaf paanch test maichon kii gharelu siries main 35 wicket liye the
 However, Ashwin was just 4 wickets behind in the 2015 domestic Test series against South Africa, equaling this record by Chandrasekhar
 bhartiya sarazamin par aswin ke shandaar recordco dekhte hue unke paas aane vaale samay main bahut se maukey he jisame wo is record ko tod sakate he
 India's highest record of 5 wickets in a career and 10 wickets in a match: Anil Kumble, who holds the highest 5 wicket haul in Test matches and 10 wickets in a match from India, is in the name of 5 wickets in his career 35 times
 And has done 10 wickets in the match 8 times
 aswin ne abhi sirf 47 hi test khele he jisame unhone 25 baar 5 wicket haul or 7 baar match main 10 wicket chatkaaye he 
 It seems possible for Ashwin to hold such a record in so few matches
 test main sabase tej 300 wicket lene kaa recordbat kii jaae test cricket main sabase tej 300 wicket lene ke record kii to yah australia ke diggaj gendbaaz denis lily ke naam he, jinhone 56 test main 300 wicket lekar world record banaaya tha
 Ashwin has taken a total of 269 wickets in Tests so far
 ye aankade bataate hai ki aswin is record ko todane se zyaada dur nahin he
 Significantly, against Bangladesh recently, Ashwin broke Lily's record for the fastest 250 wickets in 45 matches, completing 250 wickets in 48 matches
 bharat kii taraf se vanade main sabase zyaada wicket lene kaa recordnil kumble ne bharat kii ore se 271 vanade match khele he jiname unhone kul 337 wicket hasil kiye hai
 Ashwin has taken 145 wickets in just 105 odis
 is shandaar record ko dekhte hue mumkin he kii aswin apane karier ke antim padaav main kumble ke vanade viketon ke is record ko bhi hasil kar lenge
 BJP, which opposes the boundary wall of the cemeteries by the Akhilesh government, is seen to be kind to Ramlila Maidan
 yogisarkaar ne pradesh ke sabhi sarkari jameenon par bani ramlila maidan kii boundry ke nirmaan kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 The Yogi government has made a provision of Rs 54 crore for the boundary wall of Ramlila grounds and the conservation center, Gaushala, in the supplementary budget presented on Monday
 iske tahat unheen ramlila maidan kii chaharadivari kii jaaegi jo sarkari jameenon par bane hai
 Apart from this, the government has taken steps for cow protection center in 68 districts of the state
 pradesh ke nagar nigamon main kanha gaushala ke liye 20 karod rupee aavantit kiya he
 The arguments made by the Yogi government for the siege of Ramlila grounds are the same as Akhilesh Yadav had been giving at the time of the siege of Bibristan
 sarkari jameenon ko avaidh kabje se bachaane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 According to the BJP, there are Ramlila grounds in the city, but all are in shabby condition
 aise main ramlila maidaanon kii marammat or uski chaharadivari karana jaruri he
 Explain that the siege of cemeteries was made a big issue in the 2017 assembly elections in Akhilesh Raj
 ise lekar bijepi ke chote bade sabhi netaaon ne samaajawaadee party par jamkar hamale kiye the
 Now Yogi Sarkar has also stepped on the same path
 bijepi pravaktaa rakesh treepathi kehete hai ki "hamane kabhi kabristaan kii gheraabandi kaa virodh nahin kiya lekin hamane akhilesh sarkaar kii us dogali niti kii aalochana jarur kii he
 He had money for the cemetery but he did nothing for the cremation grounds
 unhone kaha ki ham chaahate hai ki pradesh main jarjar haalat main pahunch chuke ramlila maidaanon ko thik kiya jaae or inaki chaharadivari jald se jald banaai jaae
 Lucknow's famous Ramlila ground, which is located in Aishbagh, will have its boundary wall elevated
 pradesh sarkaar ne ramlila maidaanon ke liye pehali baar ekamusth rakam kaa elaan kiya he
 Samajwadi Party spokesperson Anurag Bhadoria says there is no opposition to the Yogi government taking siege of Ramlila grounds
 yah to routine kaam he sarkaar ko ise karana chahie
 More important than Ramlila Maidan, at this time atrocities on women growing in the state and hate spreading among communities are big issues
 inhen lekar yogi sarkaar kuch nahin kar rahi he

 In fact, Pakistan received such information about the 'ek Tha Tiger Film' that through this film an attempt will be made to tarnish the image of ISI
 phir kya tha pakistan main is film ke promo par bain laga diya gaya
 The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority has written a letter to all TV channels and cable operators
 iske mutabik 15 agast ko relies hone vaali film- 'ek tha tiger' iesai ke ird-gird gumti he
 The purpose of this film is to tarnish the image of Pakistan's intelligence agency
 isliye sabhi channel-ek tha tiger kaa promo yaa rivyuu na dikhaaen
 This matter is related to the image of the country, so there should not be any kind of discrimination in it
 saaf he ki pakistan ko apane khufia agency kii chhavi kii kitni parvaah he
 However, whatever his exploits are
 vaise ye pehla mauka nahin jab pakistan main bhartiya filmon par pabandi lagaai ho
 In March this year, Saif Ali Khan's film 'agent Vinod' was also banned, saying that the ISI image has been misrepresented in the film
 pehle 'agent vinod' or ab 'ek tha tiger' par bain laga kar pakistan ne saaf kar diya he ki film chaahe jaisi bhi banaao lekin iesai kaa naam badnaam naa karo

 He told, 'when Madhavan kissed her in the film Guru, it was raining heavily and she was in a wheelchair
 isliye unhen us seen se judaa kuch or khaas yaad nahin he
 After kissing Imran, he used to worry, then he mentioned Emraan Hashmi
 'ghanchakkar' main vidya or imran ke bich kai kis seen shoot hue the
 Remembering him, Vidya said, 'emraan used to ask some strange question to him after every kiss scene
 lagbhag har kis seen ke baad wo poochhate the, tumhen kya lagata he siddharth (siddharth roy kapur) is kis seen ko dekhakar kya kahenge? tumhen lagata he wo mujhe meraa pement check denge? unhen har kis seen ke baad sirf yahi chintaa hoti thi ki siddharth kya kahenge or main sochati thi ki wo mujhase har seen ke baad ye kyon puch rahe hai
 From Naseeruddin Shah, Vidya considers the experience of working with Durrashad very good, but she tells Naseeruddin Shah the reason for her and Arshad's good friendship
 unka kahana he ki unhen naseer sahab se kaaphi dar lagata tha
 Due to her fear on the sets of Ishqiya, she used to talk more than Arshad
 agar unase poocha jaae ki wo kis bollywood actor ke saath kaam karnaa chaahati hai, to unhone naam liya ranbir kapur kaa
 Thanks haa @sureshtriveni

 Every day, the President of America remains in the discussion for some reason
 yah baat alag he ki unke charchaa main rahane kii vajah unka kaam kam, or bayaan zyada he
 For example, at an event in Florida, Trump once again lashed out at the media, saying that the media has its own agenda and does not have the ability to show the 'truth'
 isse pehle vah guuruuvaar ko bhi press ko bhala bura suna chuke hai
 The comments to jahaan ek taraf trump ke bayanon kii barish ho rahi he to duusari taraf unase jude chutukale or twits kii soshal media par baadh ai rahati he
 If you are active on social media, there will hardly be a day when you will not face a funny video or picture related to Trump
 philhal trump ko jis rup main soshal media par trend karte dekha ja rahaa he wo chota he
 
 
 If you speak in trump words, 'small'
 
 
 bahut bahut bahut chota
 
 ' We have read that the trump is about 6 feet in height, but in these photoshopped photos, the trump is shown to be too short
 agar aap soch rahe hai ki aisa kyon, to iskaa jawaab diya nahin ja saktaa kyonki jis tarah sardi, garmi, barish kaa mausam hota he, usee tarah aajkal soshal media par trump kaa mausam chal rahaa he or jis tarah vah media or media un par waar-prativaar kar rahi he, ho saktaa he yah mausam lanbaa chale
 At the moment, see small pictures of Trump - aamtaur par raashtrapati ke ohade par baithi hastiyaan aam logon ke bich chal rahe is tarah ke majaak kaa jawaab dena uchit nahin samajhati lekin trump twitor par jis tarah active rahete hai or unka abhi tak kaa record denkhe to aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki america raashtrapati shaayad is baar bhi in tasveeron ko banane waalon ke liye koi 'munhtod' jawaab lekar aaenge
 So where Trump's statements are raining on one side, jokes and tweets on the other side are flooded on social media
 agar aap soshal media par active hai to shaayad hi koi din aisa jaataa hoga jab trump se judaa koi mjedaar video yaa tasviir se aapkaa saamana na hota hoga
 At the moment, the way Trump is seen trending on social media is small
 
 
 trump ke hi shabdon main bolen to 'chota
 
 
 Very, very small
 
 ' hamane padhaa he ki trump kaa kad kareeb 6 foot he lekin photoshop kii gai in tasveeron main trump ko kuch zyada hi chota dikhaa diya gaya he
 If you are wondering why this is so, then it cannot be answered because just like the weather of winter, summer and rain, the trend of trump season is going on on social media nowadays and the way that the media and media on them It may be a long-term season
 philhal dekhie trump kii choti bahut choti tasviren - Usually, the celebrities sitting on the President's position do not think it is appropriate to respond to such a joke going on among the common people, but the way Trump keeps active on Twitter and see his record so far, it is being speculated that the US President Perhaps this time too, there will be some 'retort' for those who make these pictures

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja or vishesh sahaayta die jane kii maang dohraayi he
 In his letter to the Prime Minister on Saturday, Nitish said that the said demand has been put before the Central Government through letters or in various meetings of inter-state Council and NITI Aayog
 unhone kaha he ki desh kii aazaadee ke baad vikaas ke drushtikon se rajyon ke anubhav main kaaphi bhinnata rahi he
 While many states have seen rapid growth, many other states have been suffering from lack
 yojana ayog or vitt ayog ke vittiya hastantaran bhi rajyon ke bich ke is antar ko paatane main asafal rahe hai
 Nitish said that states like Bihar have had to suffer its heavy losses
 centre sarkaar ke pratyaksh evam apratyaksh anudaanon kaa sarvaadhik laabh viksit rajyon ko hi mila he
 Due to this, regional imbalances have been encouraged and islands have been created in the development of the country
 unhone kaha ki bihar jaise pichde rajya ke liye yah chintaa kaa vishay he ki rajyon ke bich nidhi ke bantwaaraa ke liye 14wein vitt ayog ne jo formula diya he uske aadhaar par kul raashi main bihar kaa hissaa 10

 The Finance Commission has given priority to the area and abundance of natural forests, while ignoring the problems of overpopulation like Bihar and specific problems of Thalaruddha state
 nitish ne kaha ki bihar dwaara harith aavaran ko badhaaye jane ke prayaas ko protsaahit karne ke bajaay uski upeksha kii gai he
 Apart from this, extensive loss of life and goods due to floods in the rivers coming from Nepal every year also puts financial burden on the state
 bihar bhautik evam saamaajik aadharbhoot sanrachana kii drushti se atyant pichhadaa he or yahaan kii prati vyakti aay rashtriya ausat se kaaphi kam he
 These special needs of the state of Bihar also need to be seen
 nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main kaha he ki 14wein vitt ayog dwaara rajyon ko antarit kiye jane vaale hisse ko 32 pratishat se badhaakar 42 pratishat kiye jane kii anushansa ko aadhaar banaate hue kendriya bajet main kendra pryojit yojanaon main rajyon ko di jane vaali raashi main kaaphi kami kii gai he jiskaa pratikul prabhaav bihar par bahut adhik padaa he
 He said that if the actual receipts are seen against the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, then the state is receiving a very small amount against the amount recommended under the tax transfer
 varsh 2015-16 main yah kami lagbhag 7 hajaar 400 karod rupee kii thi or varsh 2016-17 main lagbhag 6 hajaar karod rupee kii
 He said that despite achieving double digit growth rate in the past several years, Bihar's main parameters of development like poverty line per capita income are behind the national average in industrialization and social and physical infrastructure
 bihar ko ek samay seemaa main pichhadepan se ubaarane or rashtriya ausat ke samakaksh laane ke liye nawachaari soch ke tahat aavashyak nitigat dhaancha taiyaar karne kii tatkaal aavashyaktaa he
 Bihar is the state with the highest population density with a very low per capita income

 Therefore, the state's per capita income is only 34 of the national average
 6 pratishat he
 Nitish has written in a letter to the Prime Minister that at the time of the bifurcation of the state of Bihar, a provision was made in the Bihar Reorganization Act 2000 that a special treasury was set up under the direct control of the Deputy Chairman Planning Commission in the context of the financial difficulties facing Bihar as a result of the partition
 And she will make special recommendations as per the requirements of Bihar

 Nitish said that it is in this context that i would like to draw attention to the recommendations of the Raghuram Rajan Committee set up by the Central Government in which he presented the Composite Development Index for the states
 iske anusaar desh ke 10 sarvaadhik pichde rajyon ko chinhit kiya gaya tha
 These states also include Bihar

 However, no action has been taken on these recommendations from the Central Government level
 tippaniyan He said that in this background we demand that Bihar should get special state status

 Nitish has said that Bihar wants to contribute to the progress of the country by removing its backwardness
 hamaari vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang isi soch par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, in this background, there is a request that Bihar should be given special status and special assistance
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 ) Developed states have benefited from the direct and indirect grants of the central government
 is kaaran se kshetreey asantulan ko badhaava mila he tathaa desh ke vikaas main tapu srujit ho gaye hai
 He said that it is a matter of concern for a backward state like Bihar that Bihar's share in the total amount is 10, based on the formula given by the 14th Finance Commission for the allocation of funds between states
 9 pratishat se ghatakar 9
 7 percent
 vitt ayog ne kshetrafal tathaa prakritik wanon kii adhikta ko adhimaanata di he jabaki bihar jaise adhik jansankhya dhanatv evam thalaruddh rajya kii vishisht samasyaon kii andekhi kii he
 Nitish said that instead of encouraging Bihar's efforts to increase green cover, it has been neglected
 iske atirikt prayek varsh nepal se aane vaali nadiyon main aane vaali baadh se jaan evam maal kii vyapak kshati bhi rajya par vittiya boj daalati he
 Bihar is extremely backward in terms of physical and social infrastructure and its per capita income is much lower than the national average
 bihar rajya kii in vishesh aavashyaktaaon ko bhi dekhen jane kii zarurat he
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar has said that on the basis of the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission to increase the share to be transferred from 32 per cent to 42 per cent to the states, the amount to be given to the states in the Centrally Sponsored Schemes in the Union Budget
 There has been a considerable reduction in the adverse impact on Bihar
 unhone kaha ki 14wein vitt ayog kii anushansa ke viruddh agar vaastavik prapti ko dekha jaye to kar antaran ke tahat anushansit raashi ke viruddh kaaphi kam raashi rajya ko praapt ho rahi he
 In the year 2015-16, this reduction was about 7 thousand 400 crores and in the year 2016-17, it was about 6 thousand crores
 unhone kaha ki pichley anek varshon main dohare ank kaa vikaas dar hasil karne ke baavjood bhi bihar vikaas ke pramukh maapdandon masalan garibi rekha prati vyakti aay audyogikeekaran or saamaajik evam bhautik aadharbhoot sanrachana main rashtriya ausat se peeche he
 There is an urgent need to create the necessary policy framework under innovative thinking to bring Bihar backward in a time frame and bring it at par with the national average
 bihar sabase adhik aabaadi ke ghanatv vaala rajya he jisaki prati vyakti aay bahut nimna str par he
 Nitish has stated that according to the data for the year 2015-16, Bihar's per capita income at constant prices (2011-12) is Rs 26801 while the national average is Rs 77435
 at: rajya kii prati vyakti aay rashtriya ausat kaa maatr 34

 nitish ne pradhanmantri ko likhe patr main kaha he ki bihar rajya ke vibhaajan ke samay bihar punargathan adhinium 2000 main yah praavdhaan kiya gaya tha ki vibhaajan ke falswaroop bihar ko hone vaali vittiya kathinaaiyon ke sandarbh main ek vishesh koshang upaadhyaksh yojana ayog ke sidhe niyantran main gathit hoga or vah bihar kii aavashyaktaaon ke anuroop vishesh anushansa karegi
 In partial compliance of this provision, some assistance was being given to this state under BRGF in which the amount is not being given as per the demand in the previous years, which has also adversely affected the implementation of the schemes and provide funds to the state from its own resources
 Is Happening
 nitish ne kaha ki isi sandarbh main kendra sarkaar dwaara gathit raghuram rajan samiti kii anushansaaon kii taraf dhyaan aakrisht karnaa chaahunga jisamen unhone rajyon ke liye samgr vikaas suchakank prastut kiya tha
 According to this, the 10 most backward states of the country were identified
 in rajyon main bihar bhi sammilit he
 It was mentioned in the report that to increase the pace of development of the most backward states, the Central Government can provide central assistance in some other way
 kintu kendra sarkaar ke str se in anushansaaon par koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 The comments unhone kaha ki is prishthbhumi main hamaari maang he ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja milanaa aavashyak he
 On the one hand, with the special status of the state, the centrally sponsored scheme would increase the percentage of centrality, which would give the state an opportunity to use its resources in other development and welfare schemes, on the other hand, the flow of private investment from the exemption in direct and indirect taxes
 Will gain momentum which will create new employment opportunities for the youth
 nitish ne kaha he ki bihar apana pichhadaapan dur kar desh kii pragati main yogadan karnaa chahta he
 The demand for our special state status is based on this thinking
 at: is prishthbhumi main anurodh he ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja evam vishesh sahaayta pradaan karne kii krupa kii jaye

 kashmiri hindu mukhya rup se sapru or dhar upnaam vaale parivaar krishna paksh ke magha maheene main mata rup bhavani ke naam se havan karte or ghar main prasad ke rup main kheer banaate hai
 From my childhood, my grandmother used to make Kheer on this day and kept fast, along with her grandfather also fasted
 ek baar maine poocha ki aaj ke din kheer kyon khate he or aap sab vrath kyon rakhte hai? sabane bataaya 'sahib kunj satam' he yani kashmir kii devi rup bhavani jinhen akleshwari bhi kaha jaataa he
 Devi Roop Bhavani was born in the year 1621 Dhar family of Jyeshtha Puranamasi
 madhav ju dhar naam ke kashmiri hindu bahut dharmik or darshanik vyakti the or mata sharika yani shakti ke upaask the
 The Hari Parbat Temple of Kashmir, also known as Chakreshwari, where the form of Shakti is in the form of a huge mountain Sheela
 kaha jaataa he sthaneey logon ko jab rakshas bahut pareshaan karne lage to devi ne maina kaa rup lekar un rakshason se logon ko bachaaya, shila ke rup main devi virajman he or sindur se dhaki hui he
 Madhav Joo used to start his day with a visit to the Goddess
 rose brahm muhoort main vahaan puja archana karte the or ghanton mata sharika kii puja karte the
 It is said that Madhav arrived on the first day of Zoo Navratri at midnight in the Ashwin month of the year 1620
 manyata he ki unke bhakthi bhav ko dekhakar devi ne ek choti kanya ke rup main unako darshan die, madhav ju kanya ko dekhakar bahut prasann hue or unka bhakthi bhav aansuon ke rup main chhalak padaa, wo samaj gaye the ki saakshaat devi ne unhen darshan die he
 They offered flowers and offered sweets at the feet
 unki saadagi ko dekhakar devi atyant prasann hui
 
 madhav ju ne devi se anurodh kiya ki va unke ghar main beti ke rup main janm len or iske baad hi rup bhavani kaa janm hua or unka naam akleshwari rakhaa gaya
 Akleshwari's childhood was spent in devotion and devotion to mother Sharika
 madhav ju aadhyatm main itane leen rahete the ki unke darshan ke liye log dur-dur se chalakar aate the
 Since childhood, Akleshwari was growing up to see him
 jaise-jaise unki umr bad rahi thi vaise-vaise unka aadhyatm gyaan bhi bad rahaa tha, unke pita madhav ju hi unke guru the jinhone unako aadhyatm kaa rasta dikhaaya or diksha di
 Aleshwari is married into the Sapru family
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki unka vivaahit jivan bahut dard bharaa tha
 He was married to Hiranand Sapru, who could not understand the spiritual knowledge of Akleshwari
 unki saas somp kunj ne bhi unke is bhav main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai or antat unako keval or keval dukh hi die or sirf kamiyaan nikaali
 In the middle of the night, Akkleshwari went to offer prayers to Mata Sharika, but Hiranand began to have some doubts, he followed her to the temple, when Akleshwari saw him, he invited him to worship the goddess suddenly
 The waterfall became a bit and Hiranand had to return
 ek baar madhav ju ne akleshwari ke yahaan matake main kheer bheji or is par bhi unki saas somp kunj ko gussa aa gaya or bolne lagi ye kheer kam he main sabhi rishtedaaron ko kaise duungi? akleshwari ne bas baantne ke liye kaha or aisa kaha jaataa he ki wo kheer bantati chali gai, isiilie is din kheer banaai jati he
 Akleshwari returned the matka to his father, absorbed in devotion on the other side of Vistasta (jhelum)
 sasuraal main bahut sahane ke baad unhen apane pati ko chhodana hi padaa or unhone aadhyatm ke jivan ko hi jivan kaa arth samajha
 Wherever he practiced, he encountered many devotees
 gwaale par akhileshwari kii krupa hui to laal chandra ne akleshwari kii bahut seva kii par akleshwari ne ekant paane ke liye gaanv choda or shabkol nadi ke kinare ek jhopadi main rahane lagi
 Sometimes healing a blind person and seeing many such miracles that Bhavani devotees were shocked
 ek baar kisi ne unase unka naam poocha to bhavani ne kaha 'rup' jiskaa arth hota he 'aatm bodh' isiilie unhen 'rup bhavani' kaha jaataa he
 Bhawani's brother Lal Joo demanded to educate the son in front of Bhavani and when Bhavani gave him a pen and emerald, he simply went on writing
 bhavani ke shabdon ko vaakh kaha jaataa he jo kashmiri main he
 The temple / ashram of Mata Roop Bhavani is in Talab Tillo, Jammu
 aadhyatm kii dharti kashmir ne ek se ek santon or devi devataaon ke avtaron kaa anubhav kiya he, aisa hi ek avatar tha 'rup bhavani' jinhen aaj bhi kashmiri hindu parivaar apana aradhya maanate hegannan akaash vaani nervanpanaiy sahay thaan thanaiy chhuyaaaram hi ram bolo pavanbu t bei memanj chhuy ha ihallyahaan mata rup bhavani ne gyaan ,akaash, vaani or nirvana yani gyaan ke sabhi avyavon main ram naam ke sumiran kaa upadesh de kar gyaan or bhakthi kii kashmir ke shivamat kii avadharana ke anuroop saamanjasy kaa sateek udahaaran prastut kiya hagom auvataar su mahadivasu ha bu ha suy akh chhupura tole t rama bolebrahm panaiy mandore chhkhihakeh kaanchhi tih keh diyedukan trepith samudray chas ll84llsaxana ke path main puraa gyaan hone ke saath ram kaa naam le to brahm rup swayan praapt ho jaataa he
 In fact, Rama has been the basis of our life
 ve hamaari jivan-style or samskruti ke ang hai
 Shiva protects us like an all-time guardian
 ye hamaare aart-kshanon main sahaayak hote hai
 Shiva may not always be in our attention, but we are always in his concerns
 shiv bina deree kiye prarthana sunate hi tatkaal nidaan karte hai isliye ram or shiv alag hai hi nahin
 Both have different roles
 mata rup bhavani ne ek sadhak ke liye saamaanya bhav main bhagwaan ram kii tarah adarsh purush hone kii baat kii he

 angrejon ke jamaane main is nahar ko bakaayade durust rakhaa jaataa tha kyonki us samay nadiyon kii parivahan main khaasi bhoomika hoti thi, lekin aazaadee ke baad isko bhi baaki viraasaton kii tarah bisraa diya gaya
 Neither the flow of water was maintained in it, nor any need was felt to preserve the flow of the ending water
 jowar ke samay hughali kaa pani isamen kaaphi maatra main aata tha or apane saath kaaphi gaad bhi lekar aata tha
 As a result, this river was filled with silt
 is nadi kii tali oonchi hoti gai
 When the city grew, the drains of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation continued to fall into it
 nigam ke paas jowar or bhaate ke vakt is naale main aade vaale pani ko niyantrit karne ke liye koi tantra nahin tha
 The Adi Ganga, once 75 km long, has disappeared from many places to date
 haalanki, media reports ke mutabik, isko punerjeevit karne kii bhi koshishen huin or 1990 ke baad isko phir se jilane kii gatividhiyon main kareeb 200 karod rupee kharch kiye ja chuke hai
 a research on Adi Ganga shows that near Bundel, in Tribeni (triveni), Ganga is divided into three parts
 ek dhara saraswati, dakshin-pashchim disha main saptagram kii taraf bahati he
 The second stream, named Jamuna, flows in the southeast direction and the third stream flows through Hooghly Beach and after entering Kolkata, join the Adi Ganga and join the sea through Kalighat, Baruipur and Magara
 kai pracheen lekh or nakshon par bharosa karen to aadi ganga hi mukhya dhara thi or uski vajah se kolkata british kaal main bada bandargah ban paaya tha
 But in about 1750, the Adi Ganga stream was cut to connect the lower part of the Saraswati river to the Hooghly at Howrah near Sankrail
 or isi kaaran se zyaadaatar pani kaa pravaah pashchimottar ho gaya or hughali, ganga kii mukhya dhara ban gai, jo aaj bhi he
 However, in the late 19th century, British officer WW Hunter wrote that Hindus consider this (adiganga) old river as the real Ganges
 jo is nadi ke kinare bane pokharon main apane logon ke murde jalaate hai
 Apparently, Hunter was pointing to the tradition of burning pyre, under which there is recognition of salvation by burning on the banks of the Ganges
 1770 ke dashak main aadi ganga shahar se dur jane lagi thi, tab wiliam toli ne 15 kimi gariyaa se samukpota tak kii dhara ke bahaav ko dekhakar hairaan the or unhone aadi ganga ko sundarbans kii ore pravaahit hone vaali vidyadhri nadi se jod diya
 And for this reason today, this stream is known as Tolinala
 pehle jo nadi sundavan ke kinare borol, raajpur, harinvi or baruipur ke madhyam se pravaahit hoti thi, uskaa pravaah teji se avaruddh ho rahaa tha
 However, by the 1940s, it was a fairly large means of freight transport through boats
 1970 ke aasapaas bhi, sundarbans se shahad ikattha karne vaale log nadi parkar apni naavon ko dakshin kolkala ke vyast upnagar taaliganj kii ore jane vaale pul ke neeche khadaa karte the
 However, to this day Adi Ganga has fallen prey to the greed of the people
 isamen aapako plastic kii theliyaan, kooda, kachra, hesting (hughali ke sangam) se gariyaa (tuli ke naale) 15 kimi tak 7,851 avaidh nirmaan, 40,000 ghar, 90 mandir, 69 godaam or 12 pashu shed jaise atikaraman dikhenge (yah aankada 1998 kaa he, or hycourt main pashchim bengal sarkaar ne mana tha)
 If you do not see it then water
 philhal, gariyaa ke aage jate hi nadi gaayab ho jaati he
 About three km ahead of Narendrapur and rajpur-sonapur, Adi Ganga is not visible
 or uski paat kii jagah pakke makaan, saamudayik bhawan or sadaken namoodaar hoti hai
 He sees some big ponds which have names like Kareer Ganga, Ghosar Ganga
 jaahir he, ye bhi aadi ganga ke pani se banane vaale talab the or unke naamon se yah sabit bhi hota he
 These days you will be watching the news of floods in the country, how the eastern region of the country is distressed by this
 lekin aadi ganga kii maut misaal he ki kaise failte shahar ne nadi nigal lee he
 Sometimes you will think if you have time

 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has termed the spraying of the Foggingian mosquito repellent in delhi-ncr as mandatory
 NGT court ne kaha he kisarkarsirf dikhaave ke liye chhidkaav kaa kaam karti he
 Actually, the NGT has said these things during the order on the petition filed two years ago about the ill effects of spraying
 tribunel ne civik agencys kii pole kholte hue kaha, '' sarkaar, yah dikhaanaa chaahati he ki vah janata kii suraksha ke liye kuch kar rahi he, yahi vajah he ki chhidkaav kiye ja rahe hai
 Whereas in reality it only has a psychological effect that people are safe after spraying
 ''chhidkaav semchharanhin maratecourt ne yah tak kah diya he ki gharon ke baahar hone vaale chhidkaav se naa sirf sarkaar kii badi rakam kharch hoti he balki isse paryaavaran pradooshan se lekar trephic jam or aagjanee kii ghatnaon tak kaa khatra he
 The court has made it clear in its order that the government and civic agency are spraying only for people's eye washes, mosquitoes do not die
 engiti ne yah bhi kaha he ki gharon ke andar hone vaale chhidkaav se phir bhi machhar mar jate hai lekin gharon ke baahar sadakon par hone vaale chhidkaav se sirf paryaavaran pradooshit hota he
 a large amount of chemicals are used to spray it, which openly reaches our breath in the environment
 dengue, chikangunia or malaria jaisi bimariyon ke janmdata machhar outdoor foging hote hi duusari jagah bhaag khadey hote hai
 The court has said that instead of fogging, civic agencies should take measures to dispose of garbage and stop the water accumulating everywhere
 12 local kamishnar niyukt karne ke aadeshcourt ne is maamle main aadesh dete hue 12 local kamishnar bhi niyukt kar die hai
 It will be their responsibility in different districts of Delhi to ensure that mosquitoes do not thrive there
 iske alaava engiti ne emsidi ko yah nirdesh diya he ki vah har ilaake ke adhikari or karmchaaree kaa website par byora degi
 This details will include his name and phone number for the contact
 isse aam log apni samasya ke liye sidhe apane kshetra se jude emsidi adhikari ko phone mila sakenge
 Apart from this, in which places MCD officials worked and what results came out, it will also have to be told on the website
 yachika kaa nipataara karte hue court ne sarkaar or civik agenciyon ko nirdesh diya he ki engiti ke aadesh par banaai gai cameti machharon kii rokthaam ke upaay or prayaason par apni najar rakhegi
 Let me tell you that in the last several years, due to the emergence of mosquitoes in delhi-ncr, hundreds of people have lost their lives due to diseases like dengue chikungunya and malaria, while thousands of people have fallen prey to it

 The battle we are fighting to win
 dashanan or asaram main aakhir kya rishta he? ek treta yug kaa rakshasraj or doosraa kaliyug kaa dhongi sant
 Actually, the relationship is that Ravana had ten heads and Asaram also has a titular form
 asaram samet kul das kirdaar asaram se jude hai
 Together, they form the titular form of Asaram
 sant kaa chola ab puri tarah utar gaya he
 Asaram's real face is exposed
 sadhu ke bhesh main shaitan kaa kaam karne ke aarope main asaram jodhpur kii jail main band hai
 Masks are coming down from Asaram's face on the mask and after each mask is removed, a different face appears
 aisa lagata he ki asaram ek chehre vaale nahin hai, balki ye to dashanan hai
 Asaram's face is also a form of Asaram's face, a partner of Asaram's sin leela
 or ye saare chehre milakar asaram ko banaate hai dashanan asaram
 The first face is that of Asaram himself
 wo asaram jinhen duniya dharmik sant ke taur par jaanati thi
 The world saw his amazing performances on stage
 holi khelte hue, gaanaa gaate hue, naachte hue
 Kishan saw his form of Kanhaiya
 lekin 15 agast kii raat jodhpur main baba asaram kii kutiyaa main jo kuch bhi hua, usne asaram kaa bibhats cheharaa duniya ke saamne kar diya
 a minor girl brought from her Chhindwara ashram accused Asaram of sexual harassment
 yahi nahin us ladki ne nai dilli ke kamala market thane main asaram ke khilaaf balaatkaar or dhamkee dene kii report bhi darj kara di
 Baba started to arrest Asaram
 unke bhakton ne khub tamaasha kiya, lekin kanoon ke saamne unki ek nahin chali
 On the night of 31 August, Asaram was arrested by the police from his ashram in Indore
 ek ke baad ek papalilaon se uthaa pardasaram jail kya gayi, unki ek ke baad ek papalilaon se paradaa uthta gaya
 His old servants revealed his true face
 yahi nahin iske baad ladakiyon kii himmat badi or ek ke baad ek kai ladkiyaan saamne aa gayi or asaram par gambhir aarope lagaae
 a girl from Raipur surfaced and told that she was a student of NCC and Asaram molested her
 surat kii do bahanon ne asaram or unke bete narayan sai ke khilaaf gambhir dhaaraon main report darj karwaai he
 Sometimes Rama and the face of Ravana, who once performed in front of devotees in the form of Rama and Krishna, is now known
 us ravan ne ek sita ko kalankit karne kii koshish kii thi, lekin asaram par to jane kitni sitaaen gambhir aarope laga rahi hai
 Narayan Sai 
 
 asaram kii kaali karatuuton main shaamil chehranarayan sai sirf asaram kii ayyashiyon kaa hi raajadaar nahin tha
 Rather it is alleged that he used to exploit the girls of the ashram, one of the two sisters of Surat has accused Narayan Sai of rape
 inkaa parichay karaane kaa jarurat nahin hai
 The name is Narayana, he attains the title of Sai and his misdeeds
 
 
 narayan
 
 
 Narayan
 
 
 asaram agar numberi hai to unke bete narayan sai das numberi hai
 While Asaram is in jail, Narayan Sai is running away for fear of arresting the police
 narayan sai par bhi rape kaa aropanarayan sai par bhi unke pita kii hi tarah balaatkaar kaa aarope lagaaya he surat kii ek ladki ne
 Actually these are two sisters
 inkaa aarope he ki inamen se badi bahan kaa asaram ne shoshan kiya to choti bahan kaa shoshan narayan sai ne kiya
 This is the same Narayan Sai, who was describing the girl as mentally ill, who had filed a rape case against her father Asaram
 surat kii ladakiyon ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki narayan sai ne chah or ladakiyon ke saath balaatkaar kiya he
 Three of these girls are from Madhya Pradesh and the remaining three are from Vadodara
 narayan sai ke khilaaf surat kii do ladkiyaan saamne ain to police bhi harakat main aa gai
 a look out notice was issued against Narayan Sai and a place was searched for his search
 lekin narayan sai ab tak police ko chakma dene main kaamyaab rahe hai
 This is not the first accusation on Narayan Sai
 isse pehle indore kii ek mahila ne narayan sai ke khilaaf jhooth bolkar uski jabaran shaadi karwaane kaa aarope lagaate hue mukadmaa darj karavaaya tha
 Father-son used to take sexual enhancement drugs, like Asaram, there are various types of revelations about Narayan Sai
 ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki asaram hi nahin narayan sai bhi yon shakti vardhak dawaaon kaa seven karte the
 Allegations of black magic and exploitation of girls have also been leveled against Narayan Sai, who plays the flute, wearing peacock crowns
 april 2010 main ek enarai ne narayan sai par unki bahu ke shaareerik shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The NRI said that Narayan Sai exploited his daughter-in-law by performing black magic
 enarai ne asaram ke ashram main do bacchon kii maut ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahe dike trivedi ke saamne narayan sai kii karatuuton kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 The NRI said that the girl whom Narayan Sai had an affair with, got her son married
 isse pehle 2008 main asaram ke ahmedabad ke ashram main do bacchon kii maut main bhi aarope laga ki asaram or narayan sai ne kaala jaadu kiya tha
 In the guise of religion, the sorrow of these father sons has now opened in front of the era
 inke pitashri to pehle hi jail main pahunch chuke hai or ab jail jane kaa khatra narayan sai ke saamne bhi mandara rahaa he
 Asaram's daughter was not only exposed to the misdeeds of her daughter but also her black handiwork
 uske upar bhi asaram ke liye ladakiyon ko fansaane ke aarope lage hai
 That is, daughter Bharti was the third face of Dashaanan of Kali Yuga
 asaram ke das siron main se ek ahm sir he unki beti bharti kaa
 Bharti aka Bharti mr
g
 bharti shri ji bhi apane pita kii tarah pravachan karti hai
 Singing hymns with her melodious vocals makes the devotees proud
 desh videsh main ye mashhoor hai
 But when Asaram's face was exposed, a new face of his entire family came in front of everyone
 bharti par bhi bade sangeen aarope lage hai
 Of the two Surat-based sisters who accused Asaram and Narayan Sai of rape, the younger sister alleges that she had a leading role in getting the girl to Asaram
 apane pita asaram or bhai narayan sai kii tarah bhakton kaa darbar sajaane vaali bharti par surat kii ladki ne aarope lagaaya he ki bharti bhi asaram ke sex racket kaa ahm kirdaar thim
 She used to lure the girls and send them to Asaram and Narayan Sai
 bharti kii website shribharatishriji dot com par unki badi mahima bakhaani gai he
 It has also been said that he has divine powers, but now Bharati's text is being written in a new way
 jo aarope un par lage hai, wo kaaphi gambhir hai, unhen salaakhon ke peeche bhi pahunchaa sakate hai
 Lakshmi Devi, who was involved in the crimes of Asaram, was exposed to many faces of Baba's clan
 saare raajadaaron ke baad unki family par bhi sangeen aarope lage
 It is alleged that wife Lakshmi Devi has also been involved in the crimes of Asaram
 lakshmi devi pati ko guru bataati hai
 Baba really turned out to be Guru and his wife also fully supported the Guru
 asaram or narayan sai par balaatkaar ke aarope lagane vaali surat kii do ladakiyon ne lakshmi devi par bhi sansanikhej aarope lagaae hai- aarope he ki lakshmi devi ne ladakiyon par dabaav banaaya- or balaatkaar ke baad munh na kholane kii dhamkee bhi di
 After the allegations of both girls, Surat police issued a look out notice against Lakshmi Devi so that they do not flee abroad
 surat kii ladakiyon ne jo aarope lagaaya uski tasdik kii asaram ko kathghare main khadi karne vaali ek or mahila ne
 One more face
 
 
 shilpiasaram ke parivaar ke baad unke saare gunahon kii sabase badi raajadaar thi to shilpi
 The same craftsman who was the warden of Chhindwara Ashram
 lekin kaali karatuuton main baraabar se shaamil hone ke chalate ab jail main he
 The warden craftsman of Gurukul of Chhindwara ashram has now gone to police custody
 lekin giraftaar se pehle usne police ko khub chakaaya
 The real name of Shilpi is Sanchita Gupta
 ye asaram ke kai ahm ashramon main varden rah chuki he
 If the allegations are to be believed, then Shilpi was the biggest and important link in Asaram's sex racket
 ladakiyon ko fansaane kaa kaam shilpi hi karti thi
 There have been many revelations about Asaram
 ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki wo apane samagam ke dauraan tarch kii roshni ladki par phenkate the, jis ladki par ye roshni padati thi, sevadaar samaj jate the ki baba wo raat us ladki ke saath bitaana chaahate hai
 Believing the allegations, Baba used to pick Asaram's girl and after convincing the girl, she lured and seduced him to Asaram and used to serve Shilpi and his ilk
 shilpi asaram ke haridwar ashram main warden thi, lekin asaram ne chhindwara kii us naaballig ladki ko apane paas bulawaane ke liye ek baar phir shilpi kaa hi sahaara liya
 Asaram sent him to Chhindwara for this special work
 shilpi ne us ladki ko kai dinon tak bahakaaya, bhoot pret kaa jhansa diya, lekin jab wo ladki nahin maani to shilpi ne ladki ke mata pita ko hi raji kar liya
 Those who were devotees of Asaram for years
 15 agast kii raat asaram ne us ladki ko apane paas bulaayaa or kalank kii us kutiyaa main us maasoom ke saath jo kuch bhi kiya, uski vajah se asaram jail main band hai
 Shilpi was also on the run after Asaram's arrest
 usne adaalat main agrim jamaanat kii arji di, lekin wo bhi khaarij ho gai
 Police were raiding other ashrams in Chhindwara and Asaram in search of Shilpi
 aakhirkaar 25 sitambar ko shilpi ne jodhpur court main sarender kar diya
 If sources are to be believed, Shilpi has made some truthful statements against Baba Asaram, which may increase Asaram's difficulties even more
 duniya main insaaniyat abhi jinda he
 Its latest example was seen when a woman trapped under the train was rescued by the passengers
 musafiron ne ek saath milakar train ko peeche kii ore dhakela or mahila kii jaan batch gai

 While the Rs 12,600-crore mega-scam involving the diamond industry has created a stir in the banking sector across the country, an investigation by 'india Today' has revealed how the same set of precious gems and gems are shown on paper from government institutions
 Repeatedly, there was a fraudulent practice of taking loans
 desh ke financial hub maane jane vaale mumbai main india today kii special invastigeshan team kii jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki kaise kuch jaalsaaj hira kaarobaari ek hi stock kii shipping baar-baar kaagajon par dikhaakar or unka mulya badhaakar sarkari bainkon ko chuunaa lagaate rahe
 According to estimates by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Indian banks have a loan of $ 11 billion to the gems and gems industry
 india today kii jaanch se saamne aayaa he ki kis tarah anek kaarobaari khule taur par bank se liye karj ko jokhim vaale real estate sector yaa share bazaar main laga rahe hai
 At the heart of the PNB scandal that rocked the banking sector of the country are diamond merchants like Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who repeatedly took loans by obtaining fake bank guarantee letters while not repaying any old debts and charges
 india today kii jaanch se hira- jawaharaat udyog ke aise kai log benakaab hue, jo un taur-tareekon se anjaan nahin hai jo kathith taur par mamaa-bhaanje (mehul chokasee-neerav modi) ne apanaae
 The investigation revealed that this trickery of taking loans by repeatedly showing the same stock of jewels is called 'twisting the dolls' in the specific language of the business
 isamen niryaat ke aankadon ko badha- chadha kar mote karj liye jate hai
 J
, a diamond trader in Mumbai with India Today's Under Cover Reporters
 patel ne khulkar baat kii
 Patel explained in detail how some companies work by forming cartels and taking loans from banks in the name of working capital by repeatedly showing the same batch
 patel ne bataaya, ‘maan lijie ki hiron kii khep ko yahaan se niryaat kiya gaya
 You start getting paid (shipment debt) in your books when the consignment is sent anywhere outside the US, Hong Kong, Bangkok or India
 niryaat kii gai khep ko taskari ke jariye phir bharat le aayaa jaataa he
 In the books, the businessman is able to show that he owes money to foreign customers
 hakeekat menvidesh vaali companybhi us kaarobaari kii apni hi hoti he
 According to Patel, the new loans taken from banks are then used to repay the old loans
 jo over- inviasingh (bill main keemat ko badha kar dikhaanaa) kii jaati he, wo paisa aaraam se us kaarobaari kii jeb main chalaa jaataa he
 Patel said, "documents on such exports are presented in banks and debt is sought for working capital to deal with the cost
 bainkon ko ye nahin pataa chal paata ki karj ke paise kaa istemaal kaarobaari kis kaam ke liye kar rahaa he
 Turnover is reported to increase continuously by showing transactions related to exports in books
 ye sab kagajaat par hi hota rahata he
 What else would a bank employee see? Not just the turnover in the books
 
 
 ’hira kaarobaari ke mutabik is tarah bainkon se liye gaye karj kaa adhiktar paisa blike market main laga diya jaataa he or us par motaa byaaj liya jaataa he

 Rajesh said, 'your real amount is 200 crores which includes showing the manufacturing cost of 100 crores rupees
 ye puraa 200 karod baithta he
 So you will get 200-200 crore loan from India, Hong Kong, Dubai and USA
 yani 200 karod rupye (material vailu) par hi 800 karod kaa lone mil jayega
 Rajesh referred to similar tactics to exaggerate the valuation of the company, sounding similar to what Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi allegedly used in the PNB case

 com / 7buaagz6ng — Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) December 1, 2015 narendra modi sarkaar ke 4 saal puure ho gaye hai
 During this period, along with all the reformist steps, political experiments and electoral achievements of Brand Modi, the government has also faced constant opposition
 khaas baat ye he ki vipaksh ke saath-saath modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bijepi ke andar se bhi lagaataar awaajen uthin
 From the 2014 General Election to the tripura-gujarat elections, while the brand of mododi-shah was burning, the voices of opposition from within the party also rose
 modi ke khilaaf bijepi ke andar se aawaaj uthaane vaale kai netaa party ke kaaphi puraane netaa hai jo unpar sanghathan par kabje tak ke aarope lagaate rahe
 Five such leaders are being talked about here
 shatrughna sinha2014 main modi sarkaar banane or team modi main jagah nahin mil paane ke baad se ab tak bihar se bijepi saansad or purv abhinayta shatrughna sinha modi ke sabase bade aalochak bane rahe hai
 They openly oppose Modi's every decision, every step with their statements or through social media
 pienbi ghotaale ko lekar shatrughna sinha ne sidhe piem modi ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki piem modi ko ab desh ke saamne aakar press conference kar sawaalon ke jawaab dene chahie
 Last month, the BJP leader, again known as Shotgun, accused of weakening the constitutional institutions and openly said - Prime Minister Modi may loot accolades by changing clothes and traveling abroad, but for whatever the situation in the country is deteriorating
 They will only be abused, because if the captain claps then the captain also abuses
 lagaataar aalochana karte rahane ke baavjood shatrughna sinha jahaan bijepi main bane rahe vahiin virodhiargedy netaa lalu yadavaur unke bete tejasvi kaa lagaataar samarthan bhi karte rahe
 He continued to meet all anti-modi leaders including Kejriwal
 lekin party chhodane ke sawaal par shotgan ne kaha ki bijepi unki pehali or aakhri party he
 In 2014, Yashwant Sinha, a senior leader of the BJP and finance minister in the Atal government, had broken away from electoral politics
 unki jagah unke bete jayant sinha ko party ne hazaribagh se chunaav ladaaya jo ab bhi modi sarkaar main mantri hai
 But Yashwant Sinha continued to open his front against Modi
 pichley maheene yashavanth sinha ne bijepi se naata todane kaa elaan kiya or vipaksh ke kai netaaon ke saath milakar raashtra manch banaaya
 Sinha announced that Modi will save the country from the wrong policies of the government
 isi hafte yashavanth sinha ne piem modi ourbhajapa adhyaksh amit shahpar hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki aaj kii bhaajapa sirf do logon kii party banakar rah gai he
 Yashwant said that in 4 years Jaitley brought the country's economy down
 pichley saal yashavanth sinha ne arthvyavastha ko lekar vistrut lekh likhaa tha or kaha- ‘’aaj arthvyavastha kii kya haalat he? nijee nivesh gir rahaa he
 Industrial production is shrinking
 krishi sankat main he, construction or duusare sarvice sector dhime pad rahe hai, niryaat mushkil main he,notebandi naakaam sabit huior gafalat main lagu kiye gaye jiesti ne kaiyon ko dubo diya, rojgaar chin liye
 Do not see new opportunities
 ''shanta kumarabijepi ke varisht netaa or maardarshak mandal ke netaa shanta kumaar ne isi saal farvari maah main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf apratyaksh hamalaa bolaa
 He said that Mohammad Gauri, Ghazni and British looted India, but now their own people are looting
 luutane vaale bhi apane hai or lutane dene vaali sarkaar bhi apni he
 He said that crores of billions of rupees are being loaned to some big industrialists
 aise rasukhadaaron par koi karrwai nahin hoti
 While the poor farmer borrows and his crop is wasted, strict action is taken on it
 sirf garib kisaanon tak simit karrwai kaa hi nateeja he ki teen lakh se adhikkisaan aatmahatyakar chuke hai
 Savitri Bai Phule, BJP MP from Bahraich of Savitri Bai Phuleupi, is a new challenge for her own party
 dalit samudaay se aane vaali savitri bai phule ne essi / asti act main badlaavon ko lekar apni hi party or modi sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Phule started a movement against his own government last month and organized the 'save Constitution and Reservation Maharaeli' in Lucknow
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki aarakshan koi bheekh nahin balki pratinidhitiv kaa maamla he
 If the courage to abolish reservation is done, rivers of blood will flow on the land of India
 savitri bai phule ne kaha- samvidhan or aarakshan khatre main hai
 i may or may not remain an MP but will not allow the Constitution to be tampered with
 daliton ke khilaaf hinsa oressi / asti actmen badlaav ko lekar ghiri modi sarkaar ke liye ye hamalaa ghar ke andar se hua or kaaphi asahaj karne vaala tha

 aksar logon ko shaq hota he ki khaane kii jo cheez ve istemaal kar rahe hai, kahin usamen koi milawat to nahin he? lekin aam aadmi ke paas koi tarika nahin hota jisase vah pataa kar sake yaa pukhta taur se milawat kii jaanch kar sake
 But now your problem is going to go away
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay ke kehane par FSSAI ne ek aisa kit taiyaar kiya he, jisase aap khud hi is baat kii jaanch kar sakenge ki khaane kii cheez main milawat he yaa nahin
 The special thing is that the price of this test kit will also be very low at just Rs 10 or 20
 FSSAI ne is kit ko banane kaa tarika taiyaar kar liya he or ab companiyon se baat chal rahi he jo is kit ko banaakar bazaar main utaar saken
 Initially, this kit will be able to detect adulteration of milk and edible oil
 ko dilli main central kanjumar protection council kii baithak main is baat par charchaa hui kii khaane kii tel main jagah-jagah se milawat kii kaaphi shikaayatein aa rahi hai or isse nipatane ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he
 It emerged that there is a legal ban on the sale of edible oil, despite the fact that in small towns and villages, edible oil is openly sold, which increases the chances of adulteration
 mantralay ab khaane kaa tel banane vaali companiyon se sampark karke yah kahegaa ki vah chote se chote pack main khaane kaa tel bazaar main utaaren taaki khule tel bechney kaa dhandha hi khatm ho jaae
 As an experiment, the ministry has asked a company to set up edible oil vending machines like milk and water wedding machines in West Bengal
 agar yah prayog safal rahaa to duusari jagah par bhi ise aajamaaya jayega
 Complaints of adulteration in milk also increase greatly as summer begins
 haal main hi FSSAI ne deshbhar main kareeb dhai hajaar jagahon se cemple lekar test karaayaa, to kuch chaunkaane vaali baaten saamne ain
 It was found that the complaint of adulteration of milk is more in the states of North India, while it is less in the states of South India
 FSSAI garmiyon main doodh ke milawat kii jaanch karne ke liye ek or abhiyaan shuru karne ja rahaa he jisamen desh bhar se doodh kaa cemple lekar uski jaanch kii jaaegi

 Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed's 'indian Mujahideen' statement has now been directly attacked by senior BJP leader LK Advani
 adwani ne udaahranon ke jariye yah kehane kii koshish kii he ki aatankwaadi na to garibi ke sataaye hue putr hai or na hi visheshtaur par agyani yaa ummid khoye hue log
 On Tuesday, Advani, citing a book, attempted to oppose Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed's opinion that the Indian Mujahideen was formed in protest against the 2002 riots
 is kitaab main kaha gaya he ki america raashtrapati baraak obama ab maanate hai ki jehadi aatankwaadi ab garib, maasoom or noummid nahin rahe gayi hai tathaa unki raajnneetik evam dharmik shikaayatein hai
 Whereas Obama's thoughts were earlier
 adwani ne apane blog ke taaja post main mark bouden kii pustak ‘da finnish: da kiling of osama bin laden’ kaa vistrut uddhriran diya gaya he
 This book claims that Barack Obama's attitude towards jihadi terrorists has changed drastically in the first decade of this century
 yah daur 9 / 11 ke hamale se lekar osama bin laden ko maare jane ke bich kaa he
 According to the book, Obama's views on the root cause of terrorism have varied
 unhone 9 / 11 ke baad ek akhbaar ko diye gayi saakshaatkaar main kaha tha, ‘yah garibi, agyanta, ashktata or niraashaa ke maahaul main panapata he
 However, ten years later when Obama was killed in 2012, Obama's views on jihadi terrorism had changed
 adwani ne kaha, ‘us din (osama ke maare jane ke baad) ke baad mujhe pakkaa bharosa he ki unke (obama ke) man main yah dharna bani hogi, jaisaa ki lekhak ne is pustak main likhaa he ki aatmghaatee hatyare na to garibi ke sataaye hue putr hai or na hi visheshtaur par agyani yaa ummid khoye hue log
 'senior BJP leaders keep making comments with such indirect references in their blogs
 unki taaja tippanee ke ek din pehle hi congress mahasachiv shakeel ahamed ne kaha tha ki narendra modi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad 2002 main hue gujarat dangon kii pratikriya swaroop indian mujahiddeen kaa gathan hua tha
 Advani has had a tense relationship with Modi since he was made the chairman of the BJP Election Campaign Committee
 adwani ne apane blog main is baat kaa bhi ullekh kiya he ki america main 9 / 11 ke hamalon ke baad tatkaaleen america raashtrapati george dablyoo bush ke rukh main kis tarah se badlaav aayaa tha

 The Supreme Court has given a severe blow to Rajiv Kumar, an officer close to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and former Kolkata Police Commissioner
 sheersh adaalat ne sharada chitfund ghotaalaa maamle main rajeev kumaar ko giraftaar karne or hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karne par roak sambandhi protection ko waapas le liya he
 The Supreme Court has also given him 7 days time to approach the High Court for anticipatory bail
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki agar rajeev kumaar saat din ke andar kalakatta hoicourt kaa rukh nahin karte hai or unako vahaan se agrim jamaanat nahin milti he, to sibiai saat din baad rajeev kumaar ko giraftaar kar sakati he
 Let us tell you that earlier when the CBI officials reached to question Rajiv Kumar, the Kolkata Police took them into custody
 iske baad rajeev kumaar ne sibiai kii giraftaar se raahat ke liye supreme court kaa rukh kiya tha or unki giraftaar par roak lag gai thi
 The CBI has not even registered an FIR against Rajiv Kumar in this case yet
 ab supreme court ke aadesh ke baad sibiai rajeev kumaar ko notice jari karegi or poochtacha ke liye bulaaegi
 The CBI will have to register an FIR in the case to question Rajiv Kumar in custody
 udhar, rajeev kumaar kii legal team ne maamle main agrim jamaanat ke liye kalakatta hoicourt jane kaa faisla liya he
 The legal team of Rajiv Kumar says that if the CBI lodges an FIR against him, then a petition will be filed in the court for cancellation of the same
 rajeev kumaar kii legal team agrim jamaanat ke liye kanoonee prakriya shuru karne ke liye chunaav ayog kaa bhi rukh karegi
 It will also appeal to the Election Commission to allow Rajiv Kumar to go to Kolkata
 hadtaal par kalakatta hoicourt ke vakilgiraftaar se bachane ke liye rajeev kumaar ek baar phir se supreme court kii sharan main ja sakate hai
 This is because the Calcutta High Court lawyers have been on strike for the last three days
 koi bhi vakil hoicourt main sunwaayee main hajir nahin ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, Rajiv Kumar can again go to the Supreme Court for his anticipatory bail
 kya he puraa maamla, koun hai rajeev kumaradarasal, sharada chitfund ghotaalaa maamle main rajeev kumaar kaa naam saamne aayaa he
 The CBI wants to interrogate Rajiv Kumar regarding this
 is silsile main sibiai ne rajeev kumaar ke thikaane par chhapemari karne bhi kii koshish kii thi
 Although the Kolkata Police had taken into custody only CBI officials, but later released
 kolkata ke purv police kamishnar or siaidi ke purv ADG rajeev kumaar vahi hai, jinako lekar haal hi main pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee centre sarkaar ke khilaaf dharne par baith gai thim
 a few days ago, Rajiv Kumar's house was raided by the CBI
 iske khilaaf mamata banerjee ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol diya tha or dharne par baith gai thim
 After this the matter reached the Supreme Court
 sheersh adaalat ke aadesh ke baad maamla thodaa shant ho gaya tha or rajeev kumaar ko kamishnar pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 He was then appointed to the CID
 iske baad chunaav ayog ne rajeev kumaar ko siaidi ke ediji ke pad se hi hataa diya or unako waapas grih mantralay bhej diya

 pichhlaa chapter coffee popular rahaa tha
 Four contestants Hrithik Diwakar, Vaishnavi Prajapati, Akash Thapa and Bishal Sharma reached the final round of the show in Chapter 2, which came in May 2018
 is sho ko jitkar bishaal sharma ne apane naam kar liya tha
 He was elected the winner of this great battle
 bataa den ki bishaal assam ke rahane vaale hai
 Bishal won the hearts of the judges and audience with his playful nature
 haryana ke varisht mantri anil vij kaa kahana he ki hindu kabhi aatankwaadi nahin ho saktaa, or 'hindu aatankwaad' jaisi koi sangya ho hi nahin sakati
 Anil Vij accused the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of the Center of releasing the Pakistanis who had blasted the Samjhauta Express train in 2007, to break their heads, which the Congress once called 'hindu terrorism'
 Was
 congress ko bhartiya janata party (bijepi) dwaara kiye tikhe hamalon ke baad is bayaan se peeche hatate hue kahana padaa tha ki aatankwaad kaa koi dharm yaa rang nahin hota he
 In the last three years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj have also said many times in the country and abroad that terrorism has no religion
 anil vij ne kaha ki swabhaav se hi hindu kabhi aatankwaadi ban hi nahin saktaa, kyonki hinduon ko aatankwaad kabhi nahin sikhaaya gaya
 He said, "if Hindus were also terrorists, there would never have been any other terrorist in the area
 
 
 " Reacting to Haryana minister Anil Vij, who is often surrounded by controversies due to his statements, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, "he (anil Vij) has said it right

 While riding a rickshaw, one of the things that came to your mind is that the rickshaw you are sitting on will become a millionaire
 mere khyaal main aapane ye kabhi nahin sochaa hoga
 In such a situation, beyond your thinking, a rickshawler has done something that can be an inspiration for you
 nasa ne jari kii Supernova kii adbhut tasviren
 
 
 Harikishan Pippal, who runs a rickshaw on the basis of hard work and wages, has set a unique example of success
 darasal, aaj karodon ke maalik harikishan pippal kaa janm ek garib or dalit parivaar main hua tha
 The father owned a shoe repair shop
 par isse ghar kaa kharch nahin chal paata tha
 Even two days' bread was destined, that was a big deal
 apane ghar ke halaat ko dekhte hue harikishan pippal mazdooree karne lage
 But did not stop studying
 din main kaam karte the or raat main man lagaakar padhai
 The world's first super telescope will open the kingdom of the universe, but his father's health deteriorated as soon as he reached 10th
 ghar kii halaat or bhi kharaab ho gai
 Household expenses and the burden of father's medicines increased
 aise main parivaar waalon ko bina bataae harikishan ne apane kisi rishtedaar se udhaar main cycle rickshaw maangi or chalaane lage
 Do not recognize anyone, so we would tie the cloth on the face
 phir ek din harikishan ko ek factory main 80 rupee kii tankhwaah vaali naukari mil gai
 On the advice of his wife, Harikishan resumed his old shop after taking a loan of Rs 15,000 from the bank
 haalanki paariwarik vivaad ke kaaran harikishan or unke parivaar ko ghar chhodana padaa
 But he did not give up his dream
 phir ek din harikishan kii jindagi main terning point aayaa or unhen state trading korporation se 10 hajaar jodi juuta banane kaa aandar mila
 After this Harikishan never looked back
 harikishan ke paas iske baad bata se bhi order aane laga or isi bich unhone piples exports privet limited naam se company launch kii, jisamen wo antarrashtriya brands ke liye juute taiyaar karne lage
 Harikishan did not stop here
 unhone restaurant kholaa or shaadaar shaadikhana bhi banaaya
 In the healthcare sector, he founded the Heritage People's Hospital in 2001
 iske alaava unhone vaahan dilarship or publication form main bhi apni paith jamaai
 On the basis of their hard work and vision, Harikshan won the feat of success
 inaki company kaa turnover 100 karod se zyada he
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has demanded to introduce reservation in the private sector as well

 paswan ne kaha, 'ham chaahate hai ki aisa kanoon bane jiske jariye pichhadi jatiyon coprivet sector kii naukariyon main aarakshanmili
 We are seeing how pathetic the condition of Dalits is in the country even after so many years of independence

 bjp's election campaign committee chief and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Delhi on Tuesday
 kathith vajah he yojana ayog ke saath mulaakaat
 But the eyes are more on political addresses as this is Modi's first visit to Delhi after assuming the election crown
 modi iskaa istemaal adwani or joshi jaise bujurg netaaon se mail-mulakaaton ke alaava kader ko sandesh dene ke liye bhi karenge
 What does all this mean 
 
 modi subah savere party ke bujurg number-2 murali manohar joshi ke paas pahunche
 Joshi was being told among some leaders who are not of the Advani group, but Modi is not comfortable with the rise
 jab goa main ek vakt ye baat uthi ki sanketon ke bajaay sidhi baat ho or narendra modi ko piem ummidavaar ghoshit kiya jaae, to jin kuch logon ne is par ekbaraki vito kiya unamem joshi ek the
 He was also absent from the rally in Goa
 sachai to yah he ki 2004 main vaajapeyi sarkaar jane ke baad se joshi apana rajnatik mahatv banaae rakhane ke liye joardaar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 After losing the Lok Sabha elections, his emphasis was on finding a safe seat for himself
 2009 main talash kaa nateeja dikhaa, jab joshi elahabaad ke bajaay banaras se chunaav lade or loksabhaa pahunchane main safal rahe
 Even after this, he could not be rehabilitated
 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main unke gut kaa jor nahin chalaa
 In Parliament too, he did not appear to lead in debate on important issues
 joshi ko is dauraan sahaara rahaa to sirf sangh kaa
 When he was the Minister of Human Resources, he became a favorite of the Sangh through various steps like change in curriculum, teaching of astrology
 aalochakon ne ise shiksha kaa bhagavakaran kaha tha, magar joshi tab beparwaah rahe
 But now they have to care
 unhen dekhnaa he ki jab party kii duusari peedi netritv sambhaal chuki he, to unke liye kya, kitni or kahaan jagah bachati he
 Modi went to Joshi's house and had an hour-long conversation
 uske baad joshi patrakaron ke saamne aae or bole, ‘modi ji aae the
 He said that all of you guys have given me this responsibility, i am trying to play it well with everyone
 ’is dauraan joshi ke chehre or haav-bhav main vah josh nahin tha, jise modi ke sandarbh main dekhne ke bijepi kaaryakarta aadi ho gaye hai
 One of Joshi's concerns is that one of the seats from which Modi can contest the Lok Sabha elections in UP is also being told of Banaras
 aise main vah kahaan se chunaav ladenge
 However there is another aspect of this coin
 narendra modi ko apni team main nishchit rup se aise log chahie honge, jo anbhavi hon, kendriya satta ke rup rang dekh chuke hon
 He may have a trump card as Joshi
 unke jariye ye sandesh diya ja saktaa he, ki dekhie bujurgon kii abhi bhi izzat he
 These bets will be safe because Joshi can never become a threat to Modi
 khatre kii baat ai, to adwani phir yaad aae
 Will always come whenever bjp's political history is written
 jab bhi modi kii piem daavedaari kaa zikr aayega or iske baad pitamah ke coup bhawan main baithne kaa
 However, how much attention was given to this resentment by Modi, it was proved in those two days
 jab puraa party sanghathan adwani ke saamne prakat rup main dandavat tha, tab modi gujarat main vyast the
 He gave only two messages to Advani
 donon twit ke jariye
 First, millions of workers of the country want you to withdraw their resignation
 or phir do din baad doosraa ki aapane hamen niraash nahin kiya
 But even on the insistence of Rajnath, Modi did not come to Delhi to celebrate
 ab aae hai, to adwani se milane pahunche hai
 But all this is only political etiquette
 modi brigade ne baar-baar saaf kar diya he ki party ko ab sirf adwani ji kaa maargdarshan or aashirwad chahie
 Do not think to lead
 darasal adwani ne apane liye khud hi rajnatik ekant kaa biaban chunaa he
 At first he continued to pressurize the JDU
 ab jab nitish ne pallaa jhaad liya he, to nigahen bujurg kii taraf bhi uth rahi hai
 Amidst all this, Modi is going to his house, but it is also clear that in a few days these meetings will be primed
 bijepi netaa abhi bhi atal bihari vaajapeyi ke ghar jate hai
 They take blessings from them
 lekin vaajapeyi saarvajanik rup se najar nahin aate
 Advani is seen, but the party does not want them to use it only to target the organization
 isiilie sangh pramukh ke phone kii dhaal main vah istipha to bhul gaye
 But the Sangh will keep reminding them again and again to give up their attachment
 ye lajimi bhi he kyonki philhal sangh kaa moh sirf or sirf modi ke liye he
 Another stop for Modi's Delhi visit could be the Union office of Jhandewalan
 mudda yahaan bhi badlaav kaa he
 Many questions have arisen regarding Suresh Soni, the representative of the Sangh's party
 or ye sawaal ab se nahin uth rahe
 Soni's activism became national during Rajnath's first term
 aise main samajha jaataa he ki mohan bhagwat yahaan bhi change of guard karenge
 Union officials like Dattatreya Hosble with non-political interest and image can be sent to the organization
 modi kii ruchi bhi soni ko bachaane se zyada, nae daavedaar ke saath dosti ganthne main hogi
 Modi is in dire need of friends anyway
 unka matra sanghathan sangh doharaata he, sanghe shakti kalyuge
 And in this Kali-yuga, the power of the country comes only through the partners
 saajhedaar, jo aaj unki vajah se patna kii sadakon par aapas main laathiyaan bhanj rahe hai
 But after this today one will come tomorrow also
 jisaki kokh main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav hai, uske nattejey hai or unhen tay karne vaali janata kaa mizaaj he
 Whether it is Modi or someone else, everyone just has to worry about that mood
 bujurgon ke saath yaa unke bina
 Because these people are young every five years and have their stronghold on democracy

 The face of the Congress in Karnataka is not Rahul Gandhi, but Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 yahi vajah he ki rajya main party kii jeet kaa sara daaromadar unheen ke kandhe par he
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress is seen for the first time giving a straight fight to the BJP
 siddharmaiya pichley paanch saal ke apane kaamkaaj or vikaas model kii vajah se congress kaa sabase bada cheharaa banane main safal rahe hai
 That is why the party gave him permission to work independently in Karnataka
 matganana main siddharmaiya badami se aage chale rahe hai jabaki chamundeshwari se peeche chal rahe hai
 With the support of Bekhauf and unbridled Siddaramaiah, the Congress is trying to retain power in Karnataka
 congress chunaav jitati he to iskaa shrey unheen ko jayega or harati he to bhi thikra unheen ke sir phutegaa
 This is the reason why in Karnataka they are leaving no stone unturned

 Dr
 ram manohar lohia ke samaajawaadee vichaaron se prabhavit or ‘janata parivaar’ke sadsy rahesiddharmaiyane vakaalat ke peshey ko chhodkar raajnneeti apanaayi thi
 He won the Chamundeshwari assembly seat for the first time on Lokdal ticket in 1983 and later joined the Janata Party

 However, in the year 2005, Deve Gowda came out of the party and put Siddaramaiah out of the party
 jedies kaa ye kadam devgauda kii siyasat ke liye musiibat kaa sabab ban gaya
 Relations with Congress After this, in 2006, Siddaramaiah joined the Congress with his supporters

 com / 5wxys8efmm Naming the Congress, SP and BSP as 'secular syndicates', BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Saturday that it first left the Shigufa on temple construction and later withdrew it
 yah secular syndicate kii sajeesh thi or aisi sajishein is syndicate kaa aagaamee chunaav main supada saaf kar dengi kyonki janata in sabaki sachai jaanati he
 Naqvi claimed that the Congress-led government's countdown has started and BJP will form a government led by Narendra Modi on its own, winning around 300 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 congress, sapa, bispi jaisi partiyaan milakar jitne bhi hamale bijepi par karengi, vah utani hi majbootee se ubharkar aegi
 BJP Vice President Naqvi came to Kanpur to review preparations for Modi's first rally to be held in Kanpur on 19 October
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ke ram mandir nirmaan ke liye baithak karne sambandhi khabaron ke bare main unhone kaha ki yah sab congress, sapa or bispi kaa chunavi shigupha he, jo ‘secular syndicate’ ke rup main kaam karti he
 Attacking Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Naqvi said that Rahul Gandhi is standing at the clock tower of scams and playing the spoils of his party's failures
 vah aisi sarkaar ke yuvaraj hai, jiske paas uplabdhyon ke naam par prastut karne ko kuch nahin he
 That is why the Congress will be swept out of the country in the coming elections because its countdown has now started
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ke pehle tak to yah sab (sapa, bispi) ek saath rahete hai or janata ke dhan kii lootkhsot karte hai lekin chunaav shuru hote hi yah phir dikhaave ke liye alag-alag ho jate hai or aapas main nurakushti ladane lagate hai
 On the question of formation of the Third Front, Naqvi said that the Third Front is an 'expired Electoral Chocolate' and its Shigufa is left before every election, but these expectations always fail and will fail this time too
 nakvi ne kaha ki modi 19 oktober ko kanpur se uttar pradesh kii sarkaar or congress ke khilaaf shankhanaad karenge
 He claimed that upset by the misrule of the Congress, the people will give a clear mandate to the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and by winning around 300 Lok Sabha seats, the BJP will form the next government under the leadership of Narendra Modi in the country
 congress or uske secular syndicate ko in chunaavon main munh kii khaani padegi
 Earlier, he along with BJP District President Surendra Maithani looked at the preparations at Modi's rally site and went closely

 This program is being done by Yadav community organization Shri Krishna Vahani
 iske kai raajnneetik myne bhi nikaale jane lage hai
 Ashok Yadav, general secretary of Sri Krishna Vahani said that Shivpal Yadav is joining the program as the chief guest
 is kaarykram main yadav samaaj ke kaaphi logon ke shaamil hone kii ummid he
 Today's program will decide the way forward in state politics
 khaskar yadav samaaj ke raajnneetik bhavishya ko lekar
 He informed that officials have been called from districts across the state
 mana ja rahaa he ki shrikrishna vaahni ke bahaane shivpal, yadav samaaj ke bich apni raajnneetik pakad kaa test karnaa chaahate hai
 Shivpal has a big challenge to maintain his political existence after breaking the SP alliance
 darasal uttar pradesh main obisi samudaay main sabase badi sankhya yadav samudaay kii he
 The state has around 8 per cent Yadav voters and backward castes account for about 20 per cent
 soobe main mulaayam singh yadav ke raajnneetik ubhaar ke peeche yadav matadaataaon kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 For the last three decades, the Yadav society has been strongly associated with the SP
 mayawati kaa sarvajan hitay-savarjan sukhaay or narendra modi kaa sabakaa saath-sabakaa vikaas kaa naaraa bhi yadav samudaay ko sapa se juda nahin kar paaya he
 The equations are being formed after the political path of shivpal-akhilesh is separated
 unamem yadav matadaata kis disha main jayega ise lekar manthan shuru ho gaya he
 In view of this, the BJP is holding the Yayadava Sammelan in Lucknow on September 15, while Shivpal Yadav is busy strengthening his political power
 shivpal-akhilesh ke bich sulah samjhaute ke sari gunjaaish khatm ho gai hai
 Shivpal has now started converting the Samajwadi Secular Front into a political party
 unhone rashtriya or pradesh kaaryakarini kaa gathan karne kii kavayad tej kar di hai
 Shivpal is busy connecting the unhappy leaders with Akhilesh Yadav's command of the SP
 itawa ke diggaj netaa or sapa se do baar saansad rah chuke raghuraaj singh shakya, akhilesh sarkaar main mantri rahe shaadaab fatima, sharada pratap shukla or purv vidhayak malik kamaal usuf pehle hi shivpal yadav ke samaajawaadee secular morcha main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Shivpal Yadav will soon meet Atik Ahmed, MP from Phulpur
 mana ja rahaa he ki wo bhi secular morcha main shaamil ho sakate hai
 The Samajwadi Secular Front seems to be the home of rebel leaders from the SP
 shivpal lagaataar is baat ko kah rahe hai ki ye morcha sapa se ruthe netaaon ke liye hi banaaya gaya he

 priyanka dil dhadkane do main ahm kirdaar adaa kar rahi hai
 This multistarrer film, directed by Zoya Akhtar, is going to release on June 5
 is film ke bare main priyanka chopra se hui khaas baatcheet ke pesh hai kuch ansh:multistarar film'dil dhadkane do'karne kii vajah kya thi?mujhe lagata he kii ye shandaar script thi
 Every human can relate to this story and see it
 kabhi naa kabhi hamane apane pariwaron main jarur suna he ki aisa karoge to socity vaale kya kahenge
 So this story is the same with entertainment
 kya aapke parivaar main bhi aisa he kii 'log kya kahenge'?jab main 17 saal kii thi to mummy ne bina kisi ko bataae hi meri photomis indiyake liye bheji thi
 Father was not even told and when he won, the uncle of the whole family, the elder father, got to hear everyone's talk, then it happens in our family also 'what people will say'
 aapkaa dil kiske liye dhadkta he ?meraa dil har rishte main dhadkta he, chaahe film main rahul bose (pati) farhaan akhtar (mere dost) ranvir singh (bhai) yaa mere dead (anil kapur) ho
 This 10-day story is a lot of relationship issues in the film
 to meraa dil in sabake liye dhadkta he
 Does the film have Anil Kapoor as the typical father who follows his principles and rules? Yes, he has played the same character whose relationship with my mother (shefali Shah) is just over the top and the biggest issue is' What will the Society say? film main to sabhi aapako apni baat manwaane kii koshish main najar aa rahe hai lekin asal jindagi main aap kitni baagi hai?main anaavashyak baagi nahin hum, main hameshaa bahaav ke vipareet jaati hum, kuch sahi lagata he to us disha main hi jane kii koshish karti hum or aisa hi badhaava diya he mere ghar waalon ne kii jo sahi lagata he wo karo or agar kuch galat ho jaae to usko sweekaar karo
 i always accept my mistake
 aap khud chote shahar se hai or aaj bade mukaam par hai, in dinon chote shahar kii ladakiyon main koi parivartan aap dekhati hai?dekhiye main bahut lucky thi kyonki mere mata pita ne bahut saport kiya
 No matter how big our dreams are, but if the family is not together, they are scattered
 meri baaki kii family ne kabhi bhi meraa saath nahin diya
 My uncle even said that if you become an actor, do not allow you to come home
 mere dead ne hameshaa se saath diya
 He said you will become an actress but how will you study? i said that i am 18 years old and would like to give my 1 year to the film
 Then my dad said, "okay, you take one and a half years, if it is good then study it or not
" is tarah se parivaar kaa saport hona bahut hi jaruri he
 What is Feminism for you? See when i came in the industry, the producers thought that if there is a problem of dates, girls can be changed, when i did fashion, i was told that when there are no movies in my career, then women i should always do major films, i always felt bad that i am not talented? Not an artist? When 2 girls work together in a film, it is said that cat-fight will do, it is not for boys, why are we considered less ? So it has always been a fight for me, due to which i have done films like 'barfi', 'saat Khoon Maaf' or 'mary Kom' so that our producers get money and they can make more films
 aap ab ferenes kriim kaa prachaar nahin karti?haa maine bahut pehle ek saal ke liye aisa aid kiya tha lekin phir karnaa band kar diya kyonki main khudferenhin hum or wo baat alag he ki log mujhe photogenic samajhate hai
 Anil Kapoor has become your father in this film, never mind to romance with him in a film? You would not know that i gave my first shot as a hero with Anil sir (anil Kapoor), that Satish Kaushik had a film that could not be made
 ek seen hamane shoot kiya tha lekin uske baad mauka hi nahin mila
 By the way, i believe that acting is necessary for an actor
 kya rishta nibhaa rahe hai ye myne nahin rakhata
 Now i romanced with Ranveer in Gunda and in 'dil Dhadakne Do' i am in the role of his sister
 iske alaava aane vaali film 'bajirao mastaani' main unki patni kaa kirdaar nibhaaoongi, toactingkarna jaruri he
 Why do you keep the talent of your song suppressed? (laughs) i don't get time
 riyaj karne kaa haalanki 'mairi com' main chota sa gaanaa or'dil dhadkane do'main farhaan ke kehane par maine tital song gaaya he lekin sach bataaun to sirf ga dena mujhe acha nahin lagata, riyaj ke saath gaanaa jaruri he or jab bhi mauka milegaa puraa riyaj karke gaanaa gaaungi

 ' Despite the alliance with the BJP for the last two decades in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray says that nobody is close to anyone in politics
 thakare ne kaha ki raajnneeti main koi kisi kaa kareebi nahin hota
 He said that ideologically he is not as close to the new generation of BJP as he was close to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani
 umr ke 83wein paaydaan par pahunch chuke shivasena pramukh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main kareeb hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 They come and go
 angreji ke ‘close’ shabd kaa matlab bhi alag alag he
 You are someone's close and you close the doors to someone
 yah puche jane par ki kya vah vaicharik taur par bhaajapa ke kareeb hai, thakare ne kaha ki is nayi peedi ke saath nahin
 When Vajpayee was there, when Advani was there, that time was different about 20 years ago
 is bhinnata ke bare main poochne par thakare ne kaha ki mere saamne to ye sabhi nae hai
 Thackeray was asked whether he was as close to the BJP in ideology as he ever was

 Boiling shoals have rocked America's air and Guatemala for nearly a month
 rah-rah kar footte jwalamukhi or inase nikalate lave kii nadiyaan apane raste main aanevaali har chiz ko khaak karti aage bad rahi hai
 The number of deaths is increasing continuously
 haalanki in sholon ne apane andar se kai sawaal bhi baahar ugale hai
 The question is, where does the blazing fire come from inside the ground? Under what circumstances do the stones under the ground become a river of fire? How hot is a volcanic flame? behate lave kaa taapmaana kitna hota hoga?aag kaa dariyaa or khaufnak manzararah-rah kar ubalte or zamin par behate sholay kii tasviren jitani kaufanaak hai
 Equally savory
 pighalate sholay kii dilkash tasviren har baar hairaan karti hai
 The reason is that a hard and lifeless thing like stone can be transformed into a river of fire due to the heat produced inside it, it is not easily believed by seeing and knowing it
 kyonki aaj tak aap or ham apane aas-paas sachmuch jin pattharon ko dekhte aae hai, wo behad kathor, baari or sakht hote hai
 Some are so strict that even when an example of something hard is given, it is only about stones
 kitni hoti he lave kii tapishalekin 2,120 taapmaana par pighalate lave kii kahani hi kuch or he
 It is not tough, but hot enough to erase everything that comes in your way
 garm lave ke isi mizaaj ko samajhane ke liye haal hi main vaigyanikon ne kuch aise prayog kiye jinke nateezon ne khud in vaigyanikon ke saath-saath puri duniya ko bharamaa diya
 Before knowing the full truth of these experiments, let us understand how much the true heat of melting lava is at last and how much hotter it is than what is around us
 barf kaa pighalanaa32 degree taapmaana yani fahrenheit par barf pighalanaa shuru hoti he
 First look at the melting snowflake
 refricrator se nikaalane ke chand minuton ke andar hi barf tezi se pighalane lagati he or dhire-dhire pani main tabdeel ho jaati he
 Do you know what the temperature is at that time? Just 32 degrees
 32 degree kii is garmi main insaan aaraam se rah saktaa he
 Now melt the chocolate, now it is chocolate
 aam taur par chocolate 50 degree taapmaana tak apni shape yani aakaar main rahati he
 But as the heat increases, the chocolate also begins to melt
 lekin puri tarah pighalane ke liye chocolate ko bhi 90 degree taapmaana kii garmi kii darkaar hoti he
 How much heat will be required for the flowing lava, the desolation, the melting and the flowing lava to come in this form? Knowing this itself is not less than a wonder
 kyonki ye taapmaana he 2,120 degree fahrenheit yaa phir kai baar usase bhi zyaada
 The pictures of the melting lava make you feel it, but you can understand this heat by looking at these pictures of melting iron along with lava
 kyonki aam taur par lohe ko pighalane ke liye bhi 2,000 degree fahrenheit se zyaada kii garmi kii zaruri hoti he
 According to the United States Geological Survey, experiments of American scientists, at times, lava starts coming out from under the ground even at 570 degrees Fahrenheit
 lekin hairaani bhare tareeqe se apane dhire-dhire bahane or puri raftaar se chalane ke dauraan isaki garmi main kai guna zyaada izaafaa ho jaataa he
 For example, this slowly flowing Laway has a temperature of 895 degrees Fahrenheit, while a river flowing at a speed of hundred miles can have temperatures up to 2,120 degrees Fahrenheit
 jiske aas-paas fatakana bhi khud ko raakh main tabdeel kar lene vaali baat he
 But still some American scientists playing on their lives recently, the pictures of experiments done with this Lava are also mind-boggling
 lave main ai-phonevaigyanikon ne dhire-dhire behate is lave kii garmi kaa andaja lagane ke liye ek ai phone ko hi iske hawaale kar diya
 What is the result, it is in front of you
 dekhte hi dekhte aiphone main aag lag gai, vaigyanikon ne kuch der ke liye use nikaala bhi, lekin agali baar jab ye lave kii chapet main aayaa to ise raakh banate der nahin lagi
 After a canned food i phone in Laway, it was a box of canned food
 dibba lave main kya gaya, kuch aise gaayab hua ki uskaa koi naamo-nishaan hi nahin bachaa
 Now think of those houses, shops, trains or humans and animals who would be in the grip of such a lave
 pighalta or bahata lava unka kya haal karata hoga
 This lament is that of this lave coming out of sholas
 jo insaan ko khauf se bhar detii he

 We are not afraid of their rebuke
 27 agast ko hone vaali 'bhaajapa bhagaao-desh bachaao' raily fail karne ke liye ye sab kiya ja rahaa he
 Lalu, who has been an outspoken opponent of PM Modi and his BJP government, said, 'they want to end me
 suno modi, amit shah, faansee ke fande par latak jaaenge, lekin usase pehle tumhaara ahankaar, buniyaad chur-chur kar denge
 He accused PM Modi and Shah of creating a rift in the grand alliance, saying, "chillar and Khatmal will end with their (lalu's) medicine
" 'is press conference main lalu yadav ke saath maujuud unke bete or bihar ke upmukhyamantritejasvi yadavakaphi ukhde-ukhde se najar aae
 During this time, his reaction to a question caused a lot of uproar, although Lalu intervened to calm the matter
 iske baad patrakaron ne jab lalu se aage kii ranneeti ke bare main sawaal kiya, to unhone kaha ki bijepi sarkaar ko ukhaad fekenge

 Even before this, an MP had abstained from the proposal

 In its first year, the Modi government decided to invest 49 per cent foreign investment in the defense and insurance sector, apart from minor opposition, the BJP or the Sangh Parivar did not face much problem
 hui bhi to sarkaar par koi fark nahin padaa
 But as soon as 51 percent decision in retail business is made, BJP does not understand how to defend it
 lekin isse pehle yah samaj lenaa hoga ki khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh kii ijazat to disambar 2012 main hi mil gai thi jab upie satta main thi
 In 2012, there was a tremendous debate in the Lok Sabha on how to pass this law
 sarkaar kii taraf se sibbal or vipaksh kii taraf se sushamaa ne morcha sambhala tha
 Sibal used to say that employment would spread to 4 million people
 sushamaa kahati raheen ki rojgaar khatm ho jayega
 Sibal said that with the arrival of foreign investment in the retail business, the middlemen will be eliminated, Sushma said that aadhari is the traditional ATM of the rural system
 kisaanon ko shaadi, beemaari ke vakt paise detaa he
 The way the Modi government is working to connect everyone with the bank, giving atms and insurance, then in that context, the line of Sushma Swaraj or BJP should be reviewed that when everyone is getting the ATM of the bank, then the middleman means middleman Why do i need an ATM? kair tab jaise hi sushamaa swaraj ne middle main kaa paksh liya, sibbal ne kaha ki itihaas main pehali baar kisi ne sadan main soodakhoron kii vakaalat kii he
 The middlemen will be eliminated from FDI
 kanoon to paas ho gaya magar 2012 se yah 2015 he
 Nobody knows how much money came in retail business, how many lakhs of people got employment, how much supply chain started to be formed by that law
 nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki hamane pichley ek saal main kisi ko retail main epadiai kii anumati nahin di he
 Now no one told whether anyone had applied or not
 agar yah niti bekaar he, koi aa nahin rahaa he tab to ise bekaar maan samaapt hi kar diya janaa chahie
 The new controversy occurred when a department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce released its policy document on foreign investment
 jisamen multi brands retail main 51 pratishat videshi nivesh kii anumati ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he
 It states that foreign investment will be allowed in multi-brand retail of all products
 is sector main kam se kam 10 karod dollar kaa nunatam nivesh hona chahie
 Half of this money should take three years to prepare the backend infrastructure
 prasanskaran, logistic, storage, godaam vagairah bacand infrastracchar hai
 Multi-brand retail chains can be opened in cities with a population of one million or more
 maamla thodaa purana ho gaya he isliye nitiyon ke kuch bindu ko pard diya
 It was decided to have 100 percent foreign investment in railways, from 49 percent in defense to 100 percent foreign investment in some cases, 49 percent foreign investment in insurance
 lekin beemaa kii tarah multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa virodh bijepi par baari pad rahaa he
 In September 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the BJP was opposed to foreign investment in multi-brand
 yah kisaanon or chote vyapaariyon ke hit main nahin he
 We will see when we come to power
 yah bayaan iconomic times sahit kai akhabaaron main chapa he
 Anand Sharma had then said that the BJP cannot legally end the decision
 bijepi aisa kar niveshkon ko kanfus kar rahi he taaki ve bhaag jaaen
 Anand Sharma's argument is still being given that investors will be confused if this law is overturned
 sawaal he ki jis kanoon se bijepi kaa itnaa virodh he use palatney kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 it's not that easy
 abhi bhi bijepi kii aadhakarik website par retail sector par virodh kaa dastauez or netaaon ke bayaan maujuud hai
 There are also statements of Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he said that if the SP and BSP leaders oppose FDI, then they too are Mamata Banerjee Like, take your support from UPA
 upie videshiyon kii sarkaar he, videshiyon ke dwaara sanchalit sarkaar he or videshiyon ke liye sarkaar he
 This will force the small traders to shut down
 modi sarkaar kii ab kya pozishan he or kya bijepi koi alag pozishan lekar batch sakati he
 The NDA took political risks of land acquisition changes and remained adamant
 multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa masalaa poochne par hi baahar aata he
 When Vasundhara Raje Singhia came to power in February 2014 before the Lok Sabha elections, she immediately wrote to Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma to reverse the Gehlot government's decision that she did not want foreign investment in multi-brand retail in Rajasthan
 is faisle ko waapas liya jaae
 Then Anand Sharma said that this cannot happen
 ek baar haa kehane ke baad badla nahin ja saktaa
 Now it should also be seen whether Vasundhara Raje Scindia has repeated her demand by writing a letter to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of Modi government
 dilli sarkaar ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bhi kaha he ki janvari 2014 main hi centre ko bataa diya gaya tha ki ham retail main videshi nivesh nahin chaahate hai
 We still have the same decision
 iconomic times main diipipi ke sachiv amitabh kaant ne kaha he ki hamane multi brands retail sector ko nahin kholaa he
 But the information about the investment is given in the document of his department
 tippaniyan Nirmala Sitharaman has also said that FDI in multi-brand is not on automatic route
 ise sarkaar ke root se aana hoga
 The BJP had said in its manifesto that FDI policy will remain as it is
 isliye niti main koi badlaav nahin he
 We saw the BJP manifesto which said that except for the multi-brand retail sector, wherever there is a possibility of employment and resource creation, we will accept foreign investment
 lekin i carmas udyog se jude logon ke sammelan main nirmala sitaraman ne yah kah diya ki i kamrs main epadiai ke maamle main koi faisla nahin liya he
 Whereas in the new document of his department, it has been clearly written on the multi-brand page that companies which are involved in multi-brand retail cannot come in this sector through e-commerce
 to kya mana jaae ki sarkaar i kamrs main multi brands retail ko anumati dene par vichaar kar sakati he or of line yani super market vaale multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kii anumati nahin degi
 So in the multi-brand retail, FDI is clearly telling or rounding up
 on line haa or of line na
 But as soon as 51 percent decision in retail business is made, BJP does not understand how to defend it
 lekin isse pehle yah samaj lenaa hoga ki khudara kaarobaar main videshi nivesh kii ijazat to disambar 2012 main hi mil gai thi jab upie satta main thi

 So in the multi-brand retail, FDI is clearly telling or rounding up
 on line haa or of line na
 The law has passed but since 2012 it is 2015
 us kanoon se khudara vyapaar main kitna paisa aayaa, kitne lakh logon ko rojgaar mila, kitna supplai chen bananaa shuru hua kisi ko kuch pataa nahin
 Nirmala Sitharaman has said that we have not allowed FDI in retail in the last one year
 ab yah nahin bataaya ki kisi ne applai kiya tha yaa nahin
 If this policy is useless, no one is coming then it should be abolished
 nayaa vivaad isliye hua jab udyog evam vaanijya mantralay ke ek vibhaag ne videshi nivesh par apana nitigat dastauez jari kiya
 In which 51 percent foreign investment in multi-brand retail has been retained
 isamen likhaa he ki sabhi utpaadon ke multi brands retail main videsh nivesh kii anumati hogi
 There should be a minimum investment of at least $ 100 million in this sector
 iskaa aadha paisa teen saal tak bacand infrastracchar taiyaar karne main laganaa chahie
 Processing, logistics, storage, warehouses, etc
 are backend infrastructure
 das lakh yaa usase adhik kii aabaadi vaale shahar main multi brands retail chen khole ja sakate hai
 The matter has become a bit old, so read some points of the policies
 railway main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, raksha main 49 fisadi se lekar kuch maamalon main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, beemaa main 49 fisadi videshi nivesh kaa faisla ho gaya
 But like insurance, the opposition to foreign investment in multi-brand retail is overshadowing the BJP
 sitambar 2012 main ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki bijepi multi brands main videshi nivesh ke virodh main he
 It is not in the interest of farmers and small traders
 jab ham satta main aaenge to dekhiyegaa
 This statement has appeared in several newspapers including the Economic Times
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki bijepi is faisle ko kanoonee taur se samaapt nahin kar sakati he
 The BJP is doing this by configuring investors so that they flee
 anand sharma kii daleel ab bhi di ja rahi he ki agar is kanoon ko palata gaya to niveshak kanfus ho jaaenge
 The question is why there is no talk of reversing the law which BJP is so opposed to
 yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The bjp's official website still contains the protest document and statements of leaders on the retail sector
 sushma swaraj, nitin gadakari, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, rajnath singh, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh sahit pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhi bayaan hai jisamen unhone tab kaha tha agar espi or bispi ke netaa epadiai kaa virodh karte hai to unhen bhi mamata banerjee kii tarah upie se apana samarthan le lenaa chahie
 The UPA is a government of foreigners, a government run by foreigners and a government for foreigners
 isse chote vyapaaree apana shater down karne par majaboor ho jaaenge
 What is the position of Modi government now and can BJP survive by taking a different position
 endie ne bhoomi adhigrahan main badlaav kaa raajnneetik jokhim liya or adi rahi
 The issue of foreign investment in multi-brand retail comes out only when asked
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle farvari 2014 main jab vasundhara raaje singhia satta main ain to gahalot sarkaar ke faisle ko palatney ke liye turant us vakt kendriya vaanijya mantri anand sharma ko likh diya ki ve rajasthan main multi brands retail main videshi nivesh nahin chaahati hai
 This decision should be withdrawn
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki aisa nahin ho saktaa he
 Can't be changed once you say yes
 ab yah bhi dekhnaa chahie ki kya vasundhara raaje sindhiya ne modi sarkaar kii vaanijya mantri nirmala sitaraman ko khat likhakar apni maang doharaai he
 Delhi Government Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has also said that in January 2014, the Center was told that we do not want foreign investment in retail
 hamaara ab bhi vahi faisla he
 DIPP Secretary Amitabh Kant in Economic Times has said that we have not opened the multi-brand retail sector
 magar unke vibhaag ke dastauez main nivesh kii jaankaree di gai he
 The comments nirmala sitaraman ne bhi bayaan diya he ki multi brands main epadiai automatic root se nahin he
 It has to come through the government route
 bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki epadiai kii niti jaisi he waisi rahegi
 Therefore, there is no change in policy
 hamane bijepi kaa ghoshnaa patr dekha jisamen kaha gaya he ki multi brands retail sector ko chhod kar jahaan bhi rojgaar or sansaadhan nirmaan kii sambhaavna hogi ham videshi nivesh sweekaar karenge
 But Nirmala Sitharaman at the conference of people associated with e-commerce industry said that no decision has been taken in the case of FDI in e-commerce
 jabaki unke vibhaag ke nae dastavej main multi brands vaale panne par saaf-saaf likhaa he ki jo companiyaan multi brands retail main shaamil hai wo i kamrs ke zariye is sector main nahin aa sakati he
 So what can be considered is that the government may consider allowing multi-brand retail in e-commerce and will not allow foreign investment in offline or super market multi-brand retail
 to multi brands retail main epadiai ko lekar saaf-saaf kah rahi he yaa gol mol
 On-line yes and off-line no
 nayaa vivaad isliye hua jab udyog evam vaanijya mantralay ke ek vibhaag ne videshi nivesh par apana nitigat dastauez jari kiya
 In which 51 percent foreign investment in multi-brand retail has been retained
 isamen likhaa he ki sabhi utpaadon ke multi brands retail main videsh nivesh kii anumati hogi
 There should be a minimum investment of at least $ 100 million in this sector
 iskaa aadha paisa teen saal tak bacand infrastracchar taiyaar karne main laganaa chahie
 Processing, logistics, storage, warehouses, etc
 are backend infrastructure
 das lakh yaa usase adhik kii aabaadi vaale shahar main multi brands retail chen khole ja sakate hai
 The matter has become a bit old, so read some points of the policies
 railway main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, raksha main 49 fisadi se lekar kuch maamalon main 100 fisadi videshi nivesh, beemaa main 49 fisadi videshi nivesh kaa faisla ho gaya
 But like insurance, the opposition to foreign investment in multi-brand retail is overshadowing the BJP
 sitambar 2012 main ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki bijepi multi brands main videshi nivesh ke virodh main he
 It is not in the interest of farmers and small traders
 jab ham satta main aaenge to dekhiyegaa
 This statement has appeared in several newspapers including the Economic Times
 tab anand sharma ne kaha tha ki bijepi is faisle ko kanoonee taur se samaapt nahin kar sakati he
 The BJP is doing this by configuring investors so that they flee
 anand sharma kii daleel ab bhi di ja rahi he ki agar is kanoon ko palata gaya to niveshak kanfus ho jaaenge
 The question is why there is no talk of reversing the law which BJP is so opposed to
 yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The bjp's official website still contains the protest document and statements of leaders on the retail sector
 sushma swaraj, nitin gadakari, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, rajnath singh, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh sahit pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhi bayaan hai jisamen unhone tab kaha tha agar espi or bispi ke netaa epadiai kaa virodh karte hai to unhen bhi mamata banerjee kii tarah upie se apana samarthan le lenaa chahie
 The UPA is a government of foreigners, a government run by foreigners and a government for foreigners
 isse chote vyapaaree apana shater down karne par majaboor ho jaaenge
 What is the position of Modi government now and can BJP survive by taking a different position

 maamla thodaa purana ho gaya he isliye nitiyon ke kuch bindu ko pard diya
 It was decided to have 100 percent foreign investment in railways, from 49 percent in defense to 100 percent foreign investment in some cases, 49 percent foreign investment in insurance
 lekin beemaa kii tarah multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa virodh bijepi par baari pad rahaa he
 In September 2012, Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the BJP was opposed to foreign investment in multi-brand
 yah kisaanon or chote vyapaariyon ke hit main nahin he
 We will see when we come to power
 yah bayaan iconomic times sahit kai akhabaaron main chapa he
 Anand Sharma had then said that the BJP cannot legally end the decision
 bijepi aisa kar niveshkon ko kanfus kar rahi he taaki ve bhaag jaaen
 Anand Sharma's argument is still being given that investors will be confused if this law is overturned
 sawaal he ki jis kanoon se bijepi kaa itnaa virodh he use palatney kii baat kyon nahin hoti
 it's not that easy
 abhi bhi bijepi kii aadhakarik website par retail sector par virodh kaa dastauez or netaaon ke bayaan maujuud hai
 There are also statements of Sushma Swaraj, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he said that if the SP and BSP leaders oppose FDI, then they too are Mamata Banerjee Like, take your support from UPA
 upie videshiyon kii sarkaar he, videshiyon ke dwaara sanchalit sarkaar he or videshiyon ke liye sarkaar he
 This will force the small traders to shut down
 modi sarkaar kii ab kya pozishan he or kya bijepi koi alag pozishan lekar batch sakati he
 The NDA took political risks of land acquisition changes and remained adamant
 multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kaa masalaa poochne par hi baahar aata he
 When Vasundhara Raje Singhia came to power in February 2014 before the Lok Sabha elections, she immediately wrote to Union Commerce Minister Anand Sharma to reverse the Gehlot government's decision that she did not want foreign investment in multi-brand retail in Rajasthan
 is faisle ko waapas liya jaae
 Then Anand Sharma said that this cannot happen
 ek baar haa kehane ke baad badla nahin ja saktaa
 Now it should also be seen whether Vasundhara Raje Scindia has repeated her demand by writing a letter to Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman of Modi government
 dilli sarkaar ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bhi kaha he ki janvari 2014 main hi centre ko bataa diya gaya tha ki ham retail main videshi nivesh nahin chaahate hai
 We still have the same decision
 iconomic times main diipipi ke sachiv amitabh kaant ne kaha he ki hamane multi brands retail sector ko nahin kholaa he
 But the information about the investment is given in the document of his department
 tippaniyan Nirmala Sitharaman has also said that FDI in multi-brand is not on automatic route
 ise sarkaar ke root se aana hoga
 The BJP had said in its manifesto that FDI policy will remain as it is
 isliye niti main koi badlaav nahin he
 We saw the BJP manifesto which said that except for the multi-brand retail sector, wherever there is a possibility of employment and resource creation, we will accept foreign investment
 lekin i carmas udyog se jude logon ke sammelan main nirmala sitaraman ne yah kah diya ki i kamrs main epadiai ke maamle main koi faisla nahin liya he
 Whereas in the new document of his department, it has been clearly written on the multi-brand page that companies which are involved in multi-brand retail cannot come in this sector through e-commerce
 to kya mana jaae ki sarkaar i kamrs main multi brands retail ko anumati dene par vichaar kar sakati he or of line yani super market vaale multi brands retail main videshi nivesh kii anumati nahin degi
 So in the multi-brand retail, FDI is clearly telling or rounding up
 on line haa or of line na

 It is everyone's right to get education, but it is not easy to get education in everyone's luck
 chah saal kii maasoom vinanya uike jab har subah apane skool jane ke liye utsaah ke saath uthati he, to vah na keval vahaan duniya kii nai-nai chizon ke bare main sikhti he balki skool main rakhe aakarshak khilaunon ke saath bhi khelti he
 The difference between Vinnya and crores of other school children in India is that Vinnya belongs to the tribal Baiga tribe, for which playschool is an unknown concept
 baat kii jaae skulon main antar kii to yah skool madhya bharat ke rajya madhya pradesh main sthit ek prasiddh baagh sangrakshit kshetra ke thik bich main sthit he or isamen padhane vaale chaatr yahaan ke mul nivaasiyon or van adhikariyon ke bachche hai
 Located in the tiger area, the school, named after the famous mascot of the Kanha Tiger Reserve, is named after the famous mascot of Kanha Tiger Reserve, where tribal children are exposed to picture books, toys and even computers and projectors
 is skool ne pados ke das gaanvon ke bacchon ko apni ore aakarshith kiya, jisamen zyaadaatar baigaa janajati se taalluk rakhte hai
 Kanha Bhursingh playschool brought her along with the children of forest officials
 ve ek saath hi 'smart kakshaon' main padhate hai, samaan bhojan khate hai or khel maidan main ek saath khelte hai
 Children are shy and scared Ashu Bisen, a school teacher, told a news agency that most tribal children are very shy and sensitive and most of them are initially scared
 unhone kaha, "hamen unke saath behad saavdhaanee se baatcheet kerani hoti he or bilkul buniyaad se shuruyaat kerani hoti he
 Most children do not have toys at home
 ve computer, projector or kuch maamalon main pehali baar tasviren vaali kitaaben dekh rahe hote hai
 We have to be very patient with them
 lekin, samay ke saath unhone prashansaneey parinaam dikhaae hai
 After 57 years, 6 girls entered the Mizoram Sainik School, the assistant director of Slectakanha National Park
 ke
 Khare said that the idea is to end the envy of inferiority among tribal children, which they feel while interacting with mainstream people
 madhya pradesh sabase adhik janajaatiy aabaadi vaale rajyon main se ek hai, jisamen se adhiktar sankhya jangalon ke aas-paas rahati he
 However, the increasing awareness of education among marginalized tribal communities has often encouraged them to move to cities
 lekin janajaatiy bachche aksar pichhadaa mahasoos karte hai kyonki ve shahar ke bacchon ke saath khud ko jod nahin pate
 Khare said, "we try to bridge the gap between mainstream children and tribal children here because on some day these children will get out of here and feel different
" hamaara lakshya ek aisi neenv taiyaar karnaa he ki jab yah behatar or ucch schuli shiksha ke liye jaaen, to vahaan behatar karen
 This school started in 2017 in the area of schoolbagh which was open 1 year ago
 yah skool ek bangale main chalata he, jo ki khare ko yahaan apni tainaati ke vakt aavantit hua tha
 However, he decided to live in a small house so that the bungalow could be better utilized
 is bangale main teen kakshaen, ek computer prayogshaala, do projector room, ek chota pustkaalay, ek staff room or ek rasoighar banaakar ise nayaa aakaar diya gaya he
 Forest officials also send their children to this school, run by the Last Wilderness Foundation, along with another 20 charities
 yah skool bacchon ko apper kindergarton tak shiksha pradaan karata he
 All the teachers in the school are wives of forest officials
 khare ne kaha ki is skool se na sirf janajaatiy bacchon ko phayda hota he balki adhikariyon ke bacchon ko bhi samvedansheeltaa, vyapak sweekaaryata or vividhta kii behatar samaj viksit karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Especially when they interact with their classmates, who come from a completely different background
 jinka drushtikon alag hota he or jinamein se kuch ke sharir par janajaatiy tatu bhi bane hote hai
 NIT Uttarakhand did not have campus He sent 600 students to Jaipur
 He said, "it is a good thing that both the forest officer and the tribal people do not hesitate to send their children to the same school
" yah us vishwaas ko dikhaata he jise viksit karne main ham sakasham rahe hai
 "according to teacher Richa Namdev, better education has an impact not only on children's lives but also on their families
 namdev ne kaha, "adhiktar bachche behad garib prishthbhumi se aate hai
 These children have a great influence in preparing them because they often leave from here and repeat it in their homes

 Despite not underestimating Sachin Tendulkar's contribution to cricket, Pakistan's cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan said that he always ranks Sunil Gavaskar above any batsman in the world
 imran ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, sachin ne kabhi gavaskar jaisi pari nahin kheli
 See, Gavaskar faced the attack of West Indies, which had four world class fast bowlers
 unka record unke asli yogadan ko nahin bataata
 i always felt sad for him when he faced the fast bowlers and there was no fast bowler in his country before Kapil Dev came
 tippaniyan He said, Sunny played in an era when Dennis Lillee played the best bowler
 jahir (abbaas) kii timming shandaar thi
 Majid (khan) was the best at the top of his game and was also Javed (miandad)
 lekin main sachin kii uplabdhiyon ko kamatar nahin aankna chahta or maanata hum ki alag-alag yug ke khilaadiyon kii tulana uchit nahin he

 His record does not reveal his true contribution
 mujhe hameshaa unke liye dukh hota, jab unhen tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha or kapil dev ke aane se pehle unke desh main koi tej gendbaaj nahin tha

 Zaheer (abbas) had a great timing

 But i do not want to underestimate the achievements of Sachin and believe that comparing players of different eras is not fair

 Imran also praised Kapil Dev during this time and included Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the wicketkeeper in his all-time XI

 The video also features Karan Johar's sarcastic statement that 'they want both beautiful and clever girl at the same time

 The inattention to aib's video is also the secret of his success
 masalan unhen ek pakistani kru mil gaya, jisane aazaadee ke din bharatiyon or pakistaniyon ke bich dostana baatcheet ko shoot kiya
 In this, such lines between the two sides of the conversation create such an atmosphere that “do not stop, hate is stirred from both sides
 ” is kamyaabi ke baad kai brands eibi ke saath saajhedaari ke maukey talash rahe hai
 There is also scope for many types of experiments
 khamba kehete hai, “ham har baar kuch alag karne kii koshish kar rahe hai taaki bor na hon
 Things that have a lot of editing scope, such as the 'indian Mario' video
 ”(da east india kamedi team, baayen se saurabh pant, sahil shah, kunal, azim, sapan or atul khatri)online videos main abhinay karne waalon ko ek bada darshak varg bhi mil rahaa he
 Saurabh Pant, 32, founder of East India Comedy (EIC), says, "if you don't do videos on youtube, you fall behind in publicity and marketing
" ” unke you tub par ‘sex ajukeshan in india’ jaise mazaakia video ke kareeb 46,000 sabsakribar hai
 Pant believes that the online medium is a big platform for content promotion

 5 lakh ru

 24-year-old Kanan Gill of Bangalore and Vishwa Kalyan Rath also feel that presence on youtube has increased the demand for his stage performances
 gil kehete hai, “log yah sochakar dekhne aate hai ki you tub vaale hai
 "it is a great feeling

 They do not review popular films, but rather review films that are not known at all
 jaise jaani dushman, main prem kii divaani hum, gunda vagairah
 Another very popular online channel is 'the Viral Fever'
 yah cutiapa naam se hasya video banaata he
 Viral fever is the brainchild of 32-year-old Arunabh Kumar, who came out of IIT
 unhone 2010 main ek channel ko ‘ejineering diarij’ banane kaa idia diya tha
 Arunabh says, "he accepted it but started directing it to the in-laws of the mother-in-law
" ” uske baad amtivi ke liye ‘college cutiapa’ kaa bhi prasaaran nahin ho sakaa to unhone ‘da viral fever medialabs’ ke binar tale ‘infibeam’ jaisi korporate company ke liye choti-badi filmein banane lage
 He then started 'the Viral Fever Dotcom' for the youth
 (da east india kamedi kaa video sex ajukeshan in india kaa ek drishy)unka pehla sho amtivi ke realty dharawahik rodies kii parody tha
 Arunabh says, "it got more than 1 million viewers in five days
 ” cutiapa team kii banaai gai da news ower kii parody laajawab thi jisamen arnab goswami, arvind kejariwal or minakshi lekhi kii hu-ba-hu nakal utaari gai thi or raajnneeti kii tulana bollywood se kii gai thi
 Arunabh says, "we pay a lot of attention to our content and also to acting
 jisane arnab goswami kaa abhinay kiya, vah 10 dinon tak tivi par unhen sunata rahaa or unke video bhi dekhe
 "he also opened a branch of Qutiyapa
 ishk vaala lav geet kii parody ‘gaanaa vaala sang’ or ‘100 karod kaa cutiapa’ jaisi prastutiyaan film student of da year ke liye pramotional video he

 The video 'gangs of Social Media', made for the DVD launch of the film Gangs of Wasseypur, received over 20 lakh hits
 ek or kamedi video channel ‘baliwood gandu’ bhi kaaphi lokapriy he
 It was started earlier this year by 27-year-old Varun Thakur, 33-year-old Karan Talwar, 32-year-old Neville Shah, 30-year-old Brij Bhakta, 27-year-old Adar Malik and 23-year-old Kautuk Srivastava
 isaki parody ‘gore gote’ (jo fere and lavali ke vigyaapan kii parody he, jisamen purush ke ang vishesh ke liye ferenes utpaada kii baat kii gai he) or ‘shi cold me bhaiya’ ne apane liye kareeb 71,000 folover juta liye
 Online content is also protected by its own censorship
 phir bhi kamedian or lekhakon ko lagata he ki darshakon ko apane rudh vichaaron se baahar nikalne main kuch samay lagegaa
 The second problem is to change the attitude of the leaders towards satire and parody
 bhartiya media par chutili, vyangyatmak or sateek tippanee karne vaale you tub channel news londry ke sah-sansthaapak abhinandan sekhri kehete hai, “vigyaapan na milane yaa naaraazgi ke dar se media par rajnatik tippanee kam hoti jaati he
 Heritage politics takes place in our country

 The tradition of class and caste has distorted our outlook
 ham dusron par to hansate hai, khud par nahin
 As we overcome this, we will become more clean
 jaisaa ki ham ‘clothline’ main kehete hai
 " lagaataar chunavi haar ke baad jab upi main gathbandhan bhi congress kii naiyya paar nahin sakaa, to party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gupachup tareeke se ek plan taiyaar kiya
 This plan is super-40
 jiske tahat rahul ne khud desh bhar se congress ke 40 netaaon kii list banaai
 Rahul tried to be the leader who had been the first MP or MLA and had lost the recent elections, but his stature is huge
 saath hi un senior netaaon ko bhi jagah mili jo sanghathan main rahe hon yaa bhavishya main unako sanghathan main jagah di jaani ho
 After this Rahul himself called a meeting of INSUPAR 40 on 18 April 2017
 is meeting main pi chidambaram bhi shaamil hue
 Former MP from UP Rajesh Mishra and three-time former MLA Anugraha Narayan Singh and former MP from Rajasthan Harish Chaudhary were also present in the meeting
 isi tarah desh bhar se kul 40 netaaon ne meeting main hissaa liya
 Rahul told the leaders who came to the meeting that you people should go to the states and find small leaders and activists who do good and work
 khaskar iskaa pataa lagaaie ki jo mehnatee kaaryakarta hai, unhen tavajjo mil rahi he yaa nahin
 Or the big party leaders of the area should not allow such workers to come forward due to personal reasons
 iske baad rahul se form bharwaaye, jisamen netaaon kii pasand kaa rajya or wo kitna vakt de sakate hai, in sawaalon ke jawaab maange gaye
 Rahul has given all these leaders 6 months
 saath hi in netaaon kojila mukhyalayonmen jaakar kam se kam 10 din tak vahaan rukne ke nirdesh die hai
 In the same meeting, the leaders of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh said that, they have elections in their states, so they will be busy in their state
 aise main un netaaon se kaha gaya ki wo apane rajyon ke chunaav hone par vakt den
 Rahul gave the responsibility of the program to Chidambaram and asked him to outline the future
 ye meeting 18 april ko hui thi
 But till now, Rahul's super-40 leaders are looking forward to future programs and activists in a quest
 in netaaon kaa bhi maananaa he ki shaayad kaarykram band hi ho jayega
 In this regard, Congress spokesperson Sandeep Dixit said that Super 40 was a plan within a party, now he is becoming the secretary in charge, he is getting a place in the organization, so that he will do the same work while still in office
 haalanki, haal main jharkhand ke prabharee banearpn sinhaur chhattisgarh ke prabharee bane piel puniya super 40 main the hi nahin
 In such a situation, now it seems that after three months, Rahul's plan to do something in 6 months has been stopped before Super 40 is successful or unsuccessful

 com / msvydxiaw6 tata group ke chairman pad se hataae jane ke baad sirus mistre ne group par kai gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Mistry has alleged that he did not have complete freedom to work as chairman
 tata sans ne sirus mistre ke aaropon ko bebuniyaad or durbhaavnapurna qaraar diya he
 Company's response to the allegations of Mistry In response to the allegations of the company, the company has claimed that they are now talking unnecessarily, they had full freedom to work as chairman, and if something like this was happening to them then Why did he not mention it while in office? yahi aaropon kii safai par tata samooh ne kaha kimistretathyaheen baaten kar rahe hai or is tarah ke bebuniyaad aaropon ke upar saarvajanik bahes main utarana tata sans kii garima ke khilaaf he
 If the questionnaire group raised on Mistry's policies, it has enough records to prove the allegations of Mistry wrong and the evidence will be put in the appropriate forum if necessary
 company kaa daawa he ki mistre neboard memberonkaa bharosa kho diya tha
 The company contends that Mistry was on the board of the company since 2006 and on 28 December 2012, he was made the chairman of the company
 itane lambey samay tak vibhinn padon par kaam karne ke baad unhen group kii parampara, prachaalan, parichaalan kii jaankaree honi chahie thi
 No dissatisfaction with Mistry on the board, the Tata company objected to the leak of the email sent by Mistry to the board and termed it indecent
 company kaa kahana he ki mistre ne karmchaariyon kii najaron main group kii chhavi par keechad oochhaalane kii koshish kii he, yah akshamya he
 Tata Sons said in a statement that the strength of the group is not limited to just boardroom values and principles and extends to more than 6 lakh employees
 mistre ne karmchaariyon kii nigahon main samooh kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kii he
 Being an executive chairman, it was his responsibility to take the group forward
 lekin unke kai nirnyon se board memmsantoshtha or isi kaaran unhen pad se hataaya gaya
 Decline in Tata Company's stock The market cap of Tata group companies has fallen to Rs 26,000 crore in 3 days after the removal of the Mistry
 guuruuvaar ko tisies ko chhod group kii sabhi companiyon ke share bhav neeche aa gaye
 9 highest in Tata Teleservices
 72 fisadi kii giravat rahi
 Tata Motors share price 1
 44%, tata power ke 1
 36% and 0 of Tata Steel

 On Monday, Mistry was abruptly removed from the position of chairman of Tata Sons and replaced by his predecessor Ratan Tata
 jiske baad company ke board ko bheje email main mistre ne kai gambhir aarope lagaae the
 This email was made public on Wednesday
 bhaajapa kii yuva ikai dwaara jagah-jagah lagaaye gayi pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke vyangy chitra vaale hordingon par congress bhadak gayi he, jinamein unki pagadi ko kathith taur par latakate dikhaaya gaya he
 The Congress termed these hoardings as offensive to the religious sentiments of the Sikhs and demanded that BJP leaders should apologize for this senseless display of protest
 pradesh congress pravaktaa narendra saluja ne kaha, ‘bhartiya janata yuva morcha ne garibi kii paribhaasha ko lekar pradhanmantri manmohan singh or yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ke vyangy chitra vaale hording shahar bhar main lagaaye hai
 It shows in the picture of the Prime Minister that his half head is not covered and his turban is hanging
 ’saluja ne kaha, ‘sikh samudaay main pagadi dharmik manyataon se judi hoti he
 In such a situation, through objectionable hoardings bearing the satirical picture of Manmohan Singh, the youth unit of BJP has made fun of the entire community by introducing dirty politics and has hurt its religious sentiments
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bhajayumo ke aapattijanak hordingon ke liye bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari, madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or party ke pradesh adhyaksh prabhaat jha ko sikh samudaay se maafee maangani chaiye
 Along with this, strict action should be taken against those who place such hoardings

 This was New Zealand's first win in three matches while Korea lost the second

 com / zvscesxhw4 In the year 2010, India Today's report published on the state of the states, Assam was the lowest among the 20 major states in the categories of agriculture and good governance
 2011 main pasa palat gaya he or assam is baar in donon shreniyon main khud ko pehali rank par paata he
 All-round progress: It is important to clarify before the twenties of Gujarat and Maharashtra that the entire body has been adopted in ranking states as compared to these reports of India Today's last eight years
 swasthya: haryana main milti he sabko muft sevapahali baar hamaare adhyayan main rajyon ko rank pichley ek saal main unke dwaara kiye gaye sudhaaron ke aadhaar par di gai he
 The period that has been surveyed to rank states this year is between 2009-10 and 2010-11
 nirantarata banaae rakhane ke liye pichley sabhi surveykshanon kii tarah ranking unheen aath shreniyon (krishi, praathmik swasthya, upabhokta bazaar, praathmik shiksha, sarkaar sanchaalan, buniyadi dhaancha, nivesh or vrihat arthvyavastha) par kii gai he or nauveen shrenee baaki shreniyon main hui pragati kaa sakal yoga he
 Governance: Manipur and Assam The best new method of surveying has resulted in a huge upswing in rankings
 hameshaa peeche rahane vaale assam sareekhe rajyon ko kai saalon se vikaas na hone ke nuksaan ke boj se mukti mili he
 Similarly, states like Punjab, which traditionally topped the rankings, have removed the advantages of long-term development
 buniyadi dhaancha: himachal ne dikhaai nai roshni kii kirasam jaise paramparaagat taur par pichde rajya ko agrani rajyon se barabari karne main kaaphi samay lag saktaa he, bhale hi haal ke varshon main uskaa pradarshan behatar rahaa ho
 Education: It may take a long time for Haryana and Puducherry to fall to the bottom of the Mari Bazikisi Agua state, even though its performance has been relatively weak in recent years
 is saal ham jis tathy kaa akalan kar rahe hai, vah badlaav kii raftaar he, un rajyon ko chinhit karte hue jo gatisheel hai or un rajyon ko alag-thalag karte hue jo atake pade hai
 In this way, what comes out of the data and news given in this package is the more recent assessment of the states of India
 nivesh: gujarat main safal he nivesh karnapichley saal centre main nitigat taur par puri tarah tehraav kii sthiti thi-upie sarkaar bhrashtachar or ghotaalon main ghiri hui thi or sannipat main thi- lekin kuch rajyon main prabhaavshaalee nitigat gatishiltaa thi
 In two categories, the award-winning state of Assam, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi won for the third consecutive term in power based on solid achievements
 rajya ko kanoon or vyavastha main teji se hue sudhaar or rajya ke kisaanon ko labhanvit karne vaali khaas yojanaon kaa phayda mil rahaa he
 Large Economy: Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Haryana, who has received the award for the highest improvement in health education and health from Maharashtra Urja Shakti, has led innovative schemes that have improved the social sectors of the state, in those areas
 Where he traditionally lived backward
 acha pradarshan karne vaale donon rajya congress shasit hai
 Maharashtra is the most advanced macroeconomy and overall most advanced state along with Gujarat
 upabhokta bazaar: uttarakhand or goa he sabase behatarsaaf he ki november, 2010 main pradhanmantri karyaalay se parachute se mumbai main utaare gaye prithviraj chavaan parivartan ke kaarak rahe hai
 Like Narendra Modi, the record-keeping chief minister has been few
 satta main ek dashak se ve gujarat ko udyogon ke liye zyada aakarshak thikaana banane ke liye sangharsh jari rakhe hue hai
 They are winning the race for investment in the states based on a heap of large projects including Maruti Suzuki's first plant outside Haryana coming to Gujarat in a few months
 kheti: mizoram or assam rahe sabase agechhote rajyon kii shrenee main, purvottar ke rajyon- mizoram, arunachal pradesh, nagaland or manipur ne adhikansh shreniyon main dilli or goa jaise rajyon ko pachhad diya he
 Despite the death of one Chief Minister and the resignation of another this year, Arunachal Pradesh is the most advanced small state, taking advantage of the Central Economic Package and huge investments in the energy sector
 mizoram ne kheti ke maamle main bahut badhiya pradarshan kiya he, jo bhoomi prayog niti main badlaav ke boote he, jisase chaaval ke utpaadan main badhotaree hui he
 He is also at the helm in health with effective implementation of National Health Insurance Scheme and Mizoram State Health Protection Scheme
 aam dharna yah he ki bharat kaa shashan nai dilli se hota he
 In fact, state capitals are now becoming more important
 1991 se shuru hue kota-permit raaj ke khatme ke baad aarthik sudhaaron kii duusari peedi ke liye bhautik dhanchaagat suvidhaayen, saamaajik kshetra (shiksha or swasthya) main baari nivesh or prabhavi nishpaadan or kheti main kayapalat kii jarurat he
 States are the key actors in all of these
 centre milane vaale paise par niyantran bhale hi kar saktaa ho, lekin prabhavi amal kii ranneetiyaan taiyaar karne kaa kaam rajyon par he
 Western industrial power source states like Gujarat and Maharashtra have already understood this
 darasal gujarat main vikaas dar kai varsh se do ankon main chal rahi he
 The rest of the states are also looking after
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii aguai main buniyadi dhaanche main baari-bharkam nivesh karne vaale bihar main 2010-11 main vikaas dar 14 fisadi rahi he
 The reformist Dr
 who exacerbated the dismal public distribution system in the state
 raman singh kii aguai vaale chhattisgarh main vikaas dar 11
 Has been 5 percent
 inaki tulana main akhil bhartiya ausat mahaj 8 fisadi rahaa he
 The central government can draw the framework of gross development, but states with good governance can certainly push the boundaries further and increase the welfare of their citizens
