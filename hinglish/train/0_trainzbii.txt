 dilli main adhikaron kii ladaai lard rahi aam aadmi party sarkaar or alji anil baijal ke bich in dinon jamkar khinchataan chal rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal's team, which has traveled for two and a half years in power, is very common in a quarrel with former LG Najeeb Jung and the current LG on several occasions
 lekin yahi jhagada sarkaar kii kai nitiyon ke lagu na hone kii badi vajah ban gaya he
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the Kejriwal government, embroiled in the quarrel, will be able to fulfill its promises on time? are seeing
 AAP ke rashtriya pravaktaa ashutosh ke mutabik agar mantriyon or alji ke bich isi tarah khinchataan chalati rahi to kaamkaaj kii gati dhimi pad jaaegi
 However, the party leaders believe that if the elected government is prevented from working, then the government will take the path of fighting
 philhal, in 2 maamalon ne saaf kiya he ki siem or dipti siem kaa alji se tanaav kitna zyada bad gaya he
 1
 pehla maamla swasthya vibhaag se judaa hua he
 Where instead of Minister Satyendra Jain, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself wrote to LG Anil Baijal and appealed to meet the staff shortage in government hospitals
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud is chitthee main kejariwal ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki alji ke kehane par kai adhikari swasthya maamalon se judi fil chupa rahe hai yaa kisi bhi mantri ko dene se inkaar kar rahe hai
 Being upset, CM Kejriwal demanded that now LG himself should fill the vacant posts in hospitals as soon as possible
 2
 The second case is related to the Law Department of Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia
 jahaan alji anil baijal ko chitthee likhakar sisodiya ne fil aurfaisle chupaane kaa aropalgaya he
 In the official note of the deputy CM present with 'aaj Tak' it is written that his opinion was not taken for appointments of Standing Council and Additional Standing Council for Delhi Government
 sisodiya kaa aarope he ki adhikari alji ke aadesh ke kaaran fil nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 As of now, Sisodia has sought a re-file from LG for comment as Minister of Law Department
 darasal, aam aadmi party ke 70 vaadon par sawaal isliye bhi hai kyonki dhai saal main kai guna bajet rakhane vaali sarkaar apane daavon par kaayam hoti nazar nahin aa rahi he
 Recently, the CM has confirmed that Delhi government hospitals have ventilators but do not have staff to operate it
 - iske alaava eksre, siti scan or emarai jaisi mashine chalaane ke liye staff kii baari kami he
 - Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal himself has claimed that drug counters are very low in government hospitals
 - isse pehle siem ne aspataalon main dawaaiyon kii kami par bhi chif secretary se report maangi thi
 - There is lack of land and space to complete the project of Mohalla Clinic
 is project ko haal hi main alji ne anumati di he
 There were also many advertisements regarding premium buses, but the matter was stuck in the LG office
 - pani kii samasya nipataane kii bajaay jal board ke adhikariyon se mantriyon or vidhayakon kaa jhagada aksar hota rahata he
 - Regarding transfer-posting of officials in the same manner, the Kejriwal government's quarrel with LG is common
 arvind kejariwal ke mantri aksar yah aarope bhi lagaate hai ki adhikari unki nahin sunate hai
 However, AAP leader Ashutosh says that the elected government cannot sit quietly
 wo dilli ke logon ke kalyaan ke liye har ladaai ladenge
 When our mlas sat in the LG office, they were forced to pass the file of the LG Comohalla Clinic
 agar alji hamaare vakeelon kii niyukti karenge or fil upmukhyamantri yaa mukhyamantri tak nahin bheji jaaegi to samvidhan ke daayre main jo hamaara haq he usko paane ke liye sangharsh zarur karenge
 Hitting out at LG, Ashutosh further says, 'if Delhi will work with the intention that the man party government has to create obstacles, then the elected government will have to fight for the rights of the people' 
 philhal, aane vaale dinon main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aam aadmi party ko mohalla clinics kii fil paas karaane ke liye jis tarah dharna dena padaa, kya yahi pintara baaki maamalon main kaam aayega yaa alji se tanaav sarkaar ke 70 point agenda ko puraa karne main ek braker sabit hoga'
 Delhiites may now find it expensive to travel in the metro
 dilli metro rail korporation ke board of diarector somvaar ko isi mahatvapurn agenda par charchaa ke liye meeting karne vaale hai
 In this meeting, the report of the Fair Fixation Committee, set to decide the new fare of the metro, will be discussed
 fere phikseshan kamity ne metro ke kiraye kii daren badhaane kii sifarish kii he, jisamen puri tarah nayaa slab apnaane kii salaah di gai he
 The committee was formed under the chairmanship of the former High Court judge, who in the last few months has set new rates after studying various aspects of the metroke operation
 sutron ke mutabik, metro kii nai daron main kamity ne alag-alag slab main kiraaya sujhaayaa he
 The fare will be fixed according to the distance, according to this, the Metro fare will start from Rs 10 and the maximum fare will be Rs 50
 metro kaa kiraaya ab duuri ke hisaab se 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 or 50 rupee hoga
 According to the prevailing rates, the fare of the metro is minimum Rs 8 and maximum Rs 30
 isse pehle 2009 main badha tha kirayadrsi adhikariyon ke mutabik,metro kaa kiraayiske pehle saal 2009 main badhaayaa gaya tha, jab yamuna bank se noida city centre tak metro line ko badhaayaa gaya tha
 DMRC argues that in these years not only the cost of operating the metro has increased, but many other expenses have also increased
 bad gaye hai metro ke kharcheiske alaava nai daren tay karte vakt ye bhi dhyaan rakhaa gaya he ki aane vaale maheenon main metro kii kai nai line bhi shuru ho rahi hai
 After the completion of the third phase, the length of the metro network will also increase and the fare will also vary according to the distance
 iske saath hiinterchange steshnabadhane se maujuuda network ke jariye bhi yatri zyada duuri tay karenge
 In this case, the maximum fare will be fixed keeping in mind the new metro line

 (input bhashaa se) Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has demanded the Bihar government to lift the ban on toddy
 iske liye somvaar ko vah patna main dharna par baithe
 He said that there was no need to ban Chief Minister Nitish Kumar Tadi after prohibition
 isse paasi jati ke logon ko kaaphi aarthik nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Nitish government's action against the Pasi caste Paswan said that toddy is natural, to sit on the dharna against the state government to fulfill the demands of the Pasi caste
 iske utpaadan main paasi jati ke log badi sankhya main lage hue hai
 Their employment is being massively hit by this ban
 sarkaar ko iske bare main sochate hue tadi ke kaarobaar par se pabandi hataa leni chahie
 Alcohol is not juice, Tadipaswan said that there is a population of about 20 lakh people of Pasi caste in Bihar
 is faisle se unke liye dikkat bad gai he
 Nitish Kumar opened liquor shops in every village for 10 years
 17 saal tak bijepi or aresas kii madad se sarkaar main rahe
 They should know that toddy is considered to be juice rather than alcohol
 isliye unhen is par se pabandi turant hataa leni chahie
 Jitan Ram Manjhi has also expressed his displeasure
 Earlier, the head of the second NDA ally Hindustani Awam Morcha and former Deputy Chief Minister of the state Jitan Ram Manjhi had also raised their voice against the ban on toddy
 unhone is par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki tadi main kuch galat nahin he, yah prakritik he or unhone bhi pi he
 Manjhi had said that the jdu-rajedi coalition government is doing injustice to the people
 faisle se naaraaz maanjhi ne rajya sarkaar ko garib or anusuchit jati or janajati ke khilaaf bataaya he
 Manjhi said- i have drunk toddy as a medicine
 Manjhi said that toddy is natural and poor and SC and ST people are involved in its business
 pabandi se unki kamai khatm ho jaaegi
 Nitish government should not take such anti-people steps
 maanjhi ne saarvajanik taur par kaha ki tadi ko dawa ke taur par bhi liya jaataa he
 i myself have drunk toddy
 unhone kaha ki lagaataar 15 dinon tak dawa ke rup main maine tadi kaa seven kiya he
 He said that toddy business was likely to increase after the ban on liquor, but the government has acted against the people
 sharabbandi ke baad tadi kii khapat kii badhane kii khabaris saal pehali april se desi sharaab par pabandi ke baad tadi keavaidh kaarobaarake badhane kii ashanka ke bich utpaada vibhaag ne tadi bechney par bhi roak laga di
 The excise department said that after the ban, by taking advantage of the current situation, businesses are drinking liquor in the toddy by mixing illicit liquor and drugs
 khabar milane ke baad vibhaag ne tadi bechney par bhi pabandi laga di he
 The department was reported to have increased consumption of toddy only hours after the alcohol ban

 So that the budget can be completed before the end of the year
 bataa den ki bajet prakriya ko puraa hone main do mahine kaa samay lag saktaa he
 In such a situation, the budget session may be the first week of November
 bharat main vitt varsh ek april se 31 march tak hota he
 This system was introduced in 1867 and it harmonized the Indian financial year with the British government's fiscal year
 isse pehle tak bharat main vitt varsh 1 may ko shuru hokar 30 april tak rahata tha
 The government set up a high-powered committee last year after PM Modi expressed his desire to match the fiscal year to the calendar year
 samiti ko vitt varsh ko ek janvari se shuru karne kii vyavhaarita kaa adhyayan karne ko kaha gaya
 The committee submitted its report to the Finance Minister in December
 maujuuda pranali main kaamkaaj ke satr kaa upyog nahnithi ayog ke ek note main bhi kaha gaya he ki vitt varsh main badlaav jaruri he
 In the current system, the working session cannot be used
 kuch maheene pehle sansad kivitt par sthaayee samiti ne bhi vitt varsh ko sthanantaritkar janvari-disambar karne kii sifarish kii thi
 According to a note prepared by Niti Aayog members Bibek Debroy and OSD Kishore Desai - the fiscal year is not linked to international practices and it affects data collection and dissemination from national accounts, needing to develop stronger systems changed the fiscal year Advocating said that a strong system needs to be developed, which can work among diversity

 ' congress adhyaksh ne congress padaadhikariyon kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘ham ek bhi vyakti ko nahin chodenge

 Criticizing n Chandrababu Naidu's 'glittering ceremony' of the 'swearing-in' ceremony, YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday said that at a time when Andhra is stuck in a lot of trouble, it is part of an 'ostentatious' function Don't want to be andhra ke uttari tatavarti paanch jilon kii samiksha karne ke baad jagan ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'ek ore naidu logon se rajdhani banane ke liye daan maang rahe hai or duusari ore apane shandaar shapath grahan samaaroh par kareeb 30 karod rupee kii raashi kharch kar rahe hai
 At the moment this is not fair and i leave it to their understanding, but personally i cannot get involved in the waste of money
 ' Reddy alleged that a section of the media is allegedly trying to show that Naidu has limited resources and is advising that it will be difficult for him to forgive the loan, but people have told the VESR Congress on tdp's administration It has given a mandate to ask questions and steps are being taken in connection with the farm loan waiver

 party kii mukhar aawaaj or dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ko centre sarkaar par hamalaa karne kaa jimmaa saunpa he

 ab piem narendra modi par kejariwal ke hamale utane aakraamak nahin rahe jitne hue karte the
 From calling the Lt
 Governor a dictator and running a parallel government on him, to writing a three-page letter to PM Modi on the issue of removing the advisors of the Delhi government, Sisodia, instead of Kejriwal, is acting as an attack on the Center
 sisodiya ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan bhi kiya or modi sarkaar par aarope lagaae
 But the party leaders say that both (kejriwal and Sisodia) are working together shoulder to shoulder
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne naam ujagar na karne kii shart par kaha, ‘jab ek prabud nirnay kiya gaya ki kejariwal apane hamalon ko dhimaa karenge to aise main kisi ko vah bhoomika nibhaani thi or manish sisodiya se behatar yah koi or nahin kar saktaa tha
 The senior leader said, "the level of closeness between the two is that when they have to take a difficult decision and they are not in a position to exchange words, they look at each other and the message goes away
 ’faisle kii badi vajahadilli sarkaar shiksha or swasthya kshetra main sudhaaron par dhyaan kendrit kar rahi he or sisodiya donon hi morchon par aage hai
 As Minister of Education, he is undertaking reforms in government schools and as Finance Minister, he is giving funds for Mohalla clinics of AAP

 Although 5 in Asif's b sample
 4 milgram nandrolon paaya gaya he jabaki pehle sample main ye maatra 6
 Was 2
 isi saal asif ne bharat main hui ipel pratiyogita main hissaa liya tha
 Then in July, IPL organizers had reported that Mohammad Asif had been found guilty in connection with banned drug use during the IPL
 haalanki asif ne is baat se inkaar kiya tha
 Asif's lawyer Shahid Karim said that both the tests were from the same sample but there was some difference in the results
 nandrolon kii maatra alag-alag ai he
 On this basis, he will challenge this test
 udhar asif ne bhi nattejey ke khilaaf ipel ke drugs inquairi tribunel main apil karne kii baat kahi he
 Asif told that he had taken some medicines before going into the IPL because he had an elbow injury
 saath hi unhone kaha ki unhone kisi bhi pratibandhit dawa kaa seven nahin kiya tha
 Asif was in the Delhi Daredevils team in the IPL
 ipel ke khatm hone ke baad pakistan lautate samay dubai police ne nashile padaarth rakhane ke aarope main asif ko hiraasat main liya tha
 Asif was declared charge-free after 19 days of detention
 november 2006 main bhi pakistan cricket board ke jaanch tribunel ne doping test positive paae jane ke baad asif par ek saal kaa pratibandh laga diya tha
 But later the Appellate Tribunal of PCB lifted the ban on Mohammad Asif giving him a clean chit in the doping case
 ab jabaki asif ko ‘bi’ sample main bhi doshi paaya gaya he to unpar phir se pratibandh lag saktaa he

 lekin aar vinay kumaar ne kohli (23) ko elbeadblyoo out karke is saajhedaari kaa jaldi hi ant kar diya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote a blog on March 20, just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, titled "respect for Institutions and Contempt of Institutions - Two conflicting approaches"
 is blog ke jariye modi ne congress or uske pratham parivaar—gandhi khandaan par tikhe hamale kiye
 The essence of this was that the institutions of the country were the biggest victims of Congress 'dynastic politics' and in the 2014 elections, people made history by electing BJP by casting votes in the spirit of 'first India' rather than 'first family'
 
 modi koi pehali baar gandhi parivaar ko nishaanaa nahin bana rahe the
 His continuous sharp attacks have been going on since 2013 when he was declared the Prime Ministerial candidate by the BJP
 unhone shahjade se lekar namdaar bataane tak, rahul gandhi par akshep kaa koi mauka nahin choda
 Modi has been consistently saying that he did not get the chair of Congress President because he has the same ability, but because he comes from a particular family
 lekin jab pradhanmantri agali baar chunavi abhiyaan par niklenge tab congress par yah akshep lagane kaa mauka unhen shaayad na mili
 On the morning of 3 July, when the temperature crossed the 40 degree level, Rahul Gandhi told a group of journalists in Parliament that he was no longer the Congress president and the party would soon have to find a new president in his place
 kuch ghanton baad, unhone twitor par ek chaar pej kaa patr post kiya, jisamen unhone bataaya ki unhone 25 may ko congress vakg cameti (seedblusi) ko avgat kara diya tha ki ab ve congress adhyaksh nahin hai or us faisle par ve ab bhi kaayam hai
 By doing this, Rahul has done something unthinkable
 congress ke itihaas main aaj tak kabhi bhi gandhi parivaar ke kisi shaks ne sheersh pad se istipha nahin diya he
 Of course, the Congress at present is the party formed by his grandmother Indira Gandhi in 1969 after a successful coup against the then Congress leadership because the then Congress leadership wanted to remove him from the post of Prime Minister
 pramukh hindibhashi rajyon main hue 1967 ke vidhansabha chunaav main party ke behad kharaab pradarshan ke liye congress netritv indira gandhi ko doshi maanata tha
 Indira Gandhi soon formed the Congress (R), which later became the Congress (I) and finally became the Indian National Congress in 1996
 haalanki kai diggajon kaa kahana he ki isse congress tut jaaegi par rahul ke kareebi sahyogi bataate hai ki yah koi aaveg main aakar liya gaya faisla nahin he or na hi koi dhong, balki ek saavdhaneepurvak or soch-vichaar kar uthaaya gaya 'rajnatik or vaicharik kadam' he
 Modi argues in his political attack that Rahul is the party president due to his surname Gandhi
 rahul us boj ko utaar phenkna chaahate hai
 He has often expressed his displeasure over his family's campaigns, including his late father Rajiv Gandhi, by slinging mud
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone bahan priyanka gandhi ke haath bhi kaman nahin saunpi
 His colleagues see his resignation and his apparent refusal to hand over the top of the party to a member of his family, the same sacrifice his mother made in 2004 when Sonia Gandhi turned down the Prime Minister's post
 party ke ek purv saansad kehete hai, ''unhone 2013 main jaipur main jo kaha tha, usamen vishwaas rakhte hai
 He had said that power is poison and today he has proved that he has not come to gain power or power in politics
 ve congress se dur nahin ja rahe hai, ve bina pad ke apana sangharsh jari rakhenge or lakhon congress sadasyon ke liye ek udhaaharan pesh karenge
 "congress stalwarts accept that this will give Rahul a morally high position, but as a general secretary asks," In whom will they find their Manmohan Singh? " Is not
 unka istipha congress sadasyon kii ek peedi ke liye bhi ek sandesh he jo aresas-bhaajapa ke gadhe nae chunavi kathy kaa muqabla karne main vifal rahi he
 At the CWC meeting on 25 May, many Congress veterans tried to argue that the defeat in the general election was not a new phenomenon for the party and that the Congress would again come back strongly as in the past
 kshubdh dikh rahe rahul ne sabko chetavanee dete hue kaha tha ki ham sab yahaan haar ke bahaane dhundne or nazarandaaj karne ke bajaae uski jimmedaari sweekaar karne aae hai
 "he resigned to set an example," says a CWC member who lost the election
 ve apeksha rakhte hai ki mukhya padon par baithe jo bhi log nattejey dene main vifal rahe, ve bhi apana pad choden or nae netaaon ke liye rasta taiyaar karen
 The Congress suffered a similar defeat in 2014
 rahul gandhi ne tab kareeb 400 congressi netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi or unase saavdhaneepurvak note liye the
 Based on those inputs, he had prepared a roadmap for the revival of the party
 lekin us yojana par kabhi amal nahin hua; kai diggajon or sonia gandhi ne unhen aashwast kiya ki is tarah ke ugr sudhaarwadi upaay party ke liye vinaashkari siddh honge
 Over the next three years — after taking over as party president in 2017 — he reached out to veterans and developed a healthy working relationship with them
 vastav main, unki gathit seedblusi kii ausat aayu 67 thi
 Nevertheless, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he felt that Congress stalwarts were harassing him and said this clearly in the CWC meeting
 twitor par post kiye ek patr main unhone likhaa, ''kai baar mujhe aisa laga jaise main puri tarah se akelaa lard rahaa hum or mujhe us baat par bahut garv he
 The decision to step down is perhaps also influenced by the realization that our democracy is witnessing rapid changes and possibly moving towards presidential-style elections
 aise main rahul gandhi ko agar modi ke kad ko chunauti deni he to unhen khud ko nae sire se taiyaar karnaa hoga
 "it is not possible in the current organizational structure of the party," says one of his colleagues
 iske alaava, modi hameshaa apana 'chywala banaam shahjada' vaala jumala doharaate rahenge
 Modi continues to challenge Rahul Gandhi to relinquish power, so Rahul left
 '' agar sutron par bharosa kiya jaae to aage kii yojana bahut sidhi he, bharat ko lekar bhaajapa-aresas ke vichaar ko chunauti detaa ek nayaa kathy bananaa
 As mentioned in the letter and they have been insisting that the Congress should first launch its fight against the bjp's main ideological source — the RSS
 yahaan tak ki unhone iske liye congress seva dal ko phir se jivit karne kii koshish kii, taaki aresas kii cader takat kaa muqabla kiya ja sake
 But this is quite difficult
 rahul gandhi ko dotarafa chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he: unki peeth par ladaa viraasat kaa boj or santhnik samarthan kii kami
 Says a party MP, "he has relieved himself of the burden of inheritance by stepping down
 unhen ab prabhavi dhang se ek vaikalpik drushtikon taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 The real challenge arises here
 ''congress nishchit rup se netritv ke sankat kaa saamana kar rahi he
 For the past six weeks, instead of trying to find its new president, the party indulged in another ridiculous drama
 party ko na keval ek nayaa adhyaksh khojane kii jarurat he, balki use ekajute bhi rahanaa hoga
 Between 1991 and 1998, following the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and the reluctance of Sonia Gandhi to enter politics, the Congress had two elected presidents — P
 ve
 Narasikwaha Rao and Sitaram Kesari
 1969 se duusare niwarchit adhyaksh kesari ko 1998 main barkhaast kar diya gaya or sonia gandhi ne party kii bagdor sanbhali
 During Kesari's tenure, several breakdowns occurred in the party
 yahi baat gandhi parivaar ko congress main itnaa aprihaary bana detii he
 The Gandhi family is the axis around which the party can revolve
 ise dekhte hue, seedblusi kii praathamikta kisi aise shaks ko dhundne kii hogi jo na sirf sabhi ke liye sweekaarya ho, balki parivaar ke prati bhi vafaadaar ho
 Many names are floating around, but the Gandhi family is showing little interest in 'choosing a successor'
 aise main congress ke think-tanks ke liye yah aasaan kaam nahin he
 Senior Congress leaders admit that this will give Rahul Gandhi a morally high position, but a party general secretary asks, "in whom will they find their Manmohan Singh?" loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad congress ke andar uthal-puthal jari he
 All party leaders are reviewing the defeat in their own way
 haalanki in chunaavon main dakshin bharat se congress ke liye raahat bhari khabar ai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress fielded 9 candidates in Tamil Nadu, out of which the party won 8 seats
 saath hi party ko 12 pratishat vot bhi mili
 Looking at the results of Tamil Nadu, it is being said that even though the performance of the Congress in other states has been poor, the Congress is again on its feet in Tamil Nadu
 aapako bataa den ki congress ne 1967 main rajya main satta ganvaa di thi or uske baad yah annadramuk yaa dramuk kii pichhalggu banakar rah gai he
 Now the Congress is facing a lot of difficulty in standing on its feet
 raajnneetik vishleshak ravidharan duraisvami kehete hai ki, 'nishchit hi congress tamilnadu main punerjeevit hone kii sthiti main hai
 This victory is not only due to being with DMK
 party ne acha pradarshan kai vajahon ke ek saath hone kii vajah se kiya jo iske or dramuk ke paksh main the'
 According to Duraiswamy, Tamil Nadu voters voted for Congress President Rahul Gandhi, whom DMK President M
K
 ke
 Stalin offered as the face of the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki tamilnadu ne pehle bhi rashtriya rujhaanon se alag tasviir pesh kii he
 In the elections held in 1977 after the Emergency, people voted for the Congress
 logon ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi ke liye matdaan kiya tha or ab phir se logon ne rahul gandhi vot diya he
 Buoyed by the results of the exit poll, the leaders of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a bjp-led coalition, will host a banquet this evening
 shaam ko 7
 Leaders of this alliance will gather at the Ashoka Hotel in Delhi at 30 pm
 23 may ke aane vaale nateezon se pehle aae agsit pole main zyadatar centre main bijepi kii sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 However, the Leader of the Opposition is completely rejecting the exit poll
 unka kahana he ki centre main is baar bijepi kii sarkaar nahin banegi iske saath hi sajeesh kii ashanka jaahir kii he
 According to reports received from Purvanchal, Paschimanchal, Bundelkhand and other parts of the state, the opposition parties allege that the exit polls are completely 'manageable' and that it is going to pressurize the personnel who are going to count the votes on May 23, and It is a tactic to throw dust in the eyes of the public
 jalon ke sapa jiladhyaksh virpal singh yadav ne kaha ki matganana main adhikariyon or karmchaariyon par gadabadi karne ke liye maansik dabaav banane ke makasad se jhootha agsit pole dikhaaya gaya he
 At the same time, the BSP chief of the same district Hiralal Choudhary says that to hide the disturbances in the evms, the BJP has broadcast the wrong exit poll under pressure from the media
 congress ke jila pramukh shyamsundar choudhary kaa maananaa he ki chunki kendra or pradesh main bhi bijepi kii sarkaar he, vah chaahe jo bhi afasaron par dabaav bana sakate hai
 Exit polls are incorrect

 The figures that Narendra Modi was telling in favor of BJP in his election meeting are coming in exit poll

 BR Sagar, assistant polling agent of Veera, a coalition candidate of Amla Lok Sabha constituency BSP, says that the exit poll is completely unbelievable
 aagaamee 23 may ko nattejey bijepi ko chaunkaa denge
 It is a conspiracy to show the candidates of the Grand Alliance very low

 He said that on 23rd, this so-called exit poll would blow

 loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon kaa purvanumaan puri tarah se andeh ke ghere main he
 Senior Congress leader former MLA Brijendra Vyas says that the result of exit poll is fully sponsored, the intention of the ruling party to create such misleading propaganda is to create disturbances in evms so that the countrymen are prepared mentally in advance

 Till now you must have seen the Khap Panchayat in the villages of the country giving the verdict, but now the Panchayati Decree has come to the fore in Delhi in the national capital
 shanivaar ko dilli ke raghubir nagar main baawari samaaj ke logon ne ek park main panchayat jamaa lee
 This khap panchayat was started on the matter of marriage of a girl and a boy
 khap kaa kahana he ki agar yah shaadi kii gai, to hamase bura koi nahin hoga
 Panchayat people are related to Bawri society
 chaliye pehle aapako puraa maamla bataate he ki aakhir kyon yah khap panchayat jamaa hui? darasal, raakhi naam kii ladki or amit naam kaa ladke ek-duusare se shaadi karnaa chaahate he
 The families of both are also ready
 magar samaaj is shaadi ke liye raji nahin
 The society says that they both have the same gotra, due to which both of them became brothers and sisters in the relationship
 is kahani main ek or mode he
 Rakhi is a Divyang and has a severed hand, due to which their relationship did not come
 is ladki se koi shaadi nahin karnaa chahta tha
 But Amit and his family decided to marry Rakhi, denying this flaw
 jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya aapke apahiz hone se rishte main koi dikkat aati thi, to uskaa jawaab tha haa
 Rakhi told that no one wanted to marry her due to being a Divyang
 magar ab amit mere saath he
 Amit also says that both of us have to get married
 jab khap ne kaha ki ladkaa or ladki kaa ek hi gotra he, to raakhi kii buaa ne unka samaaj hi badalawa diya
 Actually, Rakhi's aunt is Punjabi and she has legally adopted Rakhi i
e
 Rakhi is no longer a Gujarati society
 vah ab punjabi he
 Well Rakhi's grandmother, who belongs to the Bawri society, also wants that both of them get married
 raakhi kii buaa ne bataaya ki unhone usko god liya he
 Rakhi's sister says that both should get married
 haalanki is par khap kaa kahana he ki ham kanoon ko nahin maanate
 Our society is different
 hamaare kanoon alag hai
 We will not let these two get married
 phir chaahe kuch bhi ho jaaen
 Now this matter seems to be completely entangled because Rakhi and Amit are going to get married on June 6
 shaadi kii patrika bhi banti ja chuki he
 Now the couple trusts, only the police
 magar dekhnaa yah hoga ki khap panchayat kis tarah is shaadi ko rokatii he or police kaise inaki shaadi karwaati he

 ) mahendra singh dhoni, bhartiya cricket kaa ek bahut bada naam he lekin philhal wo apane cricket kariyar ke sabade kathin daur se guzar rahaa he
 The reason for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's trouble is a 19-year-old young cricketer
 mjedaar to yah he ki is yuva cricketer kaa antarrashtriya str par yah padaarpan siries hi he
 Mustafizur Rahman not only won the world record by taking 11 wickets in two consecutive odis, as well as forcing the very big team of ODI cricket to kneel
 cricket ke maidan main chaahe paristhiti jo bhi ho hameshaa shant dikhne vaale ‘captain kool’ ne pehle vanade ke dauraan jis tarah apana aapa khoyaa, unke phans bhi aahat jarur hue honge
 The vigorous banging of Mustafizur is not only contrary to his nature but also one of the most controversial incidents in the spirit of sports and during his career
 number-4 par ballebaaji kyon nahin?dhoni vanade ke ek behtareen finishr ke rup main hi nahin balki aage badhkar team kaa netritv karne ke liye jane jate hai
 He also showed this during the second ODI when after a long time he came down to bat at number four
 teen saal baad is pojishan par khel rahe dhoni ne shandaar 47 ran banaae
 At this position, Dhoni has scored 936 runs in 19 matches at an average of 72, which is far better than his career record
 yani ek baar phir yah sabit hua ki ballebaaji kram main unhen pehle utarane kii salaah dene vaale kai purv cricketer sahi hai
 He was fielded for the first time by Sourav Ganguly and then Dhoni scored 148 against Pakistan
 iske baad rahul dravid kii captaini main akasar unhen is pojishan par utaara gaya or unhone kabhi bhi team ko niraash nahin kiya
 But what is it that despite such a good record, he rarely landed his position under his captaincy, while the experts continued to speak and write about it? In 2007, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took over the reins of Team India, got the T20 World Cup
 2011 main world cap or 2013 main champions trophy
 Of course, the team has not been doing well for some time, but is only Dhoni responsible for this? How have the other 10 players of the team performed? This also has to be looked into
 ab agar keval record kii baat karen to pichley 10 maichon main yah keval teesri haar thi
 After winning seven consecutive matches during the World Cup, the last three matches have been lost by Team India and their opposition to this has intensified
 khud sanyas kii ghoshnaa kaa mauka de borddhoni khud bol bhi rahe hai ki board hataanaa chaahe to hataa de lekin saath hi yah bhi kah rahe hai ki wo cricket ko enjoy kar rahe hai to unhen abhi hataane kii bajaay kuch din or khelte rahane dena chahie
 When he is removed from the role of the captain of the team, his place is going to be in danger, as his batsmen are well aware of the performance of his last few innings
 aisa bhi nahin he ki dhoni vartmaan main sarvshereshth uplabdh wicketiper hai
 In such a situation, let him play for the moment because just as he announced his retirement from the Test, in the same way, when he realizes that he is not fit for the team, then he will automatically stop playing not only captaincy but also ODI
 srilanka ke raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena ne sansad kaa nilamban hataa liya he or desh main chal rahe maujuuda raajnneetik gatirodh ko samaapt karne ke liye somvaar ko sansad kii baithak bulaai he
 The officials gave this information on Thursday
 barkhaast chal rahe pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe ne iskaa swaagat karte huye kaha ki is kadam se desh main loktantr kii bahaali hogi
 Significantly, after the sudden removal of Wickramasinghe from the post of Prime Minister, there was political disturbance in the country

 Experts believe that the aim was to gain time to bring mps from Wickremesinghe's support in support of Rajapaksa, so that he could collect a figure of 113 for a majority in the 225-member parliament
 raajnneetik sankat se purv rajpakshe or sirisena ke dal ko milakar kul 95 siten jabaki vikramsinghe ke paas 106 siten thim
 Five mps of Wickremesinghe's party United National Party (UNP) have now reduced their strength to 101 as Rajapaksa goes into the court
 ek anya yuanpi saansad ne unka samarthan karne kii baat kahi he
 Officials in Rajapaksa's office said that the president has agreed to call Parliament on November 5
 sirisena or sansad ke spikar karu jayasoorya ke bich kal is mudde par charchaa hui
 Sirisena later indicated that he could call a session of Parliament next week
 yah jaankaree saamne aane ke baad vikramsinghe ne daawa kiya ki unka sansad main vishwaas he or ve isamen apana bahumat sabit kar denge
 He praised the President's move to call Parliament saying that this will restore democracy in the country
 unhone ek twit main kaha, ‘logon kii aawaaj suni gai, sansad ko paanch navambar ko bulaayaa gaya he, loktantr kii vaapasi hogi
 Jayasuriya's office has clarified that the Prime Minister's seat in Parliament will be reserved for Rajapaksa as he is mentioned in the Gazette as Prime Minister

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko daawa kiya ki in loksabhaa chunaavon main congress ko 50 siten bhi nahin milengi
 Addressing an election rally here with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, Modi referred to a survey report in support of his claim
 unhone kaha ki apana mat kharaab mat kariye
 It would be better to vote for the party that is coming to power and you can strengthen it with your vote
 modi ne kaha ki ab ek maatr sawaal yah he ki kya bhaajapa 2014 ke mukaable apni siton kii sankhya or behatar karne ja rahi he
 Modi, while targeting the Congress, accused him of ignoring police forces and using them as "punching bags" while in power
 mumbai main 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main shahid police adhikari hemanth karkare ko lekar bijepi ummidavaar sadhvi pragna singh kii tippanee ko lekar uthe vivaad kii prishthbhumi main modi ne vipaksh par nishaanaa saadhaa

 Bollywood celebrity Kid Timur is once again in the news and this time his name is up to Hollywood
 hua yun ki karina kapur khan or hollywood kii actress catherine heggl ke bich kaa conection
 Yes, both these stars had to face a lot of problems due to their children's names
 karina kapur khan or hollywood star catherine heggl kii kuch baaten aapas main kaaphi milti julati hai
 Both stars have given birth to their children on December 20 and more than them, their children are famous
 karina kapur kii bete taimur ko chuumate hue tasviir viralakarina ke bete taimur kaa janm 20 disambar kii subah ko hua tha or hollywood star catherine ne bhi usee din apane bete josh keli ko janm diya
 The third thing that Kareena Kapoor Khan and Katherine shares among themselves is the names of their two children
 karina ke liye bete kaa naam taimur ali khan rakhana unke liye pareshaani sabit ho gai thi
 However, it was becoming troublesome for Heigl to name her child as she too was struggling with her son's name
 to bete taimur ko aisa bananaa chaahati hai karina
 
 
 Bollywood industry and fans started trolling Kareena after Kareena Kapoor named her son Taimur
 hollywood movie 'grey anatomi' actress catherine heggl ko apane bete kaa naam joshuya rakhane kaa faisla lenaa kaaphi mushkil paidaa karne vaala rahaa
 Debate on social media in the name of saif-kareena's son Taimur and for Saif to name his son Taimur became a controversy
 film 'rangoon' ke pramotion ke dauraan actor saf ali khan ne kaha tha ki unhone bete taimur kaa naam badalane ke bare main ek baar sochaa bhi tha lekin karina iske khilaaf thim
 It would have been equally difficult for Hollywood star Catherine Heigl to do this as well

 ' camran ne sabase pehle november 2013 main apni dilli yatra ke dauraantatkaaleen pradhanmantrimanmohan singh se mulaakaat main is maamle ko uthaaya tha

 From this, the political class at both the national and state levels learned the lesson that even in such a difficult time, normal operation and wavering administrative attitude will not work

 mausam vibhaag ne mana tha ki rajya or jila prashasan in chetavaniyon ko sthaneey samudaayon tak pahunchaayenge lekin aisa nahin hua or nateeja vinaashkari parinaamon ke rup main saamne aayaa
 After that the Central Government also reformed its coordination system by establishing various committees at the Ministries, Cabinet Secretariat and PMO levels
 isamen sena, ardhsainik bal, vaayu sena or anya agenciyaan jarurat ke mutabik yogadan karti hai
 Actually, during the tsunami, the warning could not reach the state government machinery on time

 After studying the impact of Cyclone Hudhud, NDMA had prepared a list of policy and program in various fields

 Along with this, he said that technology should not be used to increase crop production at the cost of sustainable development
 rajdhani main pehali antarrashtriyakrishi jaev vividhtacongress ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne anusandhan or anuvaanshik sansadhano ke uchit prabandhan par jor diya
 He said that the crisis of existence for genetic resources will further increase in the coming times
 aise main jaev vividhta ke sangrakshan kii disha main rashtriya, antarrashtriya, nijee nikaaya ke sansadhano ko ‘ekajute’ karne or duniyabar ke vaigyanik visheshgyon ke bich vichaaron ko saajha karne kii jarurat hogi
 The Prime Minister said, 'around the world, crores of people are struggling against hunger, malnutrition and poverty
 is mudde ko sulajhane ke liye vigyaan evam praudyogiki behad mahatvapurn he
 We should not ignore conservation and sustainable development of biodiversity while looking for solutions
 ' unhone kaha ki krishi main praudyogiki kenkaratmakaprabhav kaa akalan karne kii jarurat he
 For this, he gave an example that the use of pesticides affects the pollination process through bees

 Modi said that it would be appropriate that we prepare a register for all such behavior records and after that research should find out what kind of behavior needs to be encouraged
 jaev vividhta main bharat kii sampannataa kaa ullekh karte hue modi ne kaha ki desh main paudhon kii 47,000 or pashuon kii 89,000 prajatiyaan hai
 Apart from this, the country has a coastal area of 8,100 km

 Now people of our age should retreat
 agar mujhase koi sarkaar main shaamil hone ko kahata he, to main isko sweekaar nahin karuunga
 My time is over
 haalanki kabhi-kabhi logon ke liye aisa kadam uthaanaa kathin hota he
 'congress leader Sam Pitroda is always in the news about his statements
 isse pehle unhone bhartiya janata party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ke blog ko lekar bayaan diya tha
 He had said that Advani said in his blog that if someone disagrees with us, it does not mean that he is a traitor
 main unke is bayaan se sahamat hum
 i thank him for putting this point in front at the right time
 'aapako bataa den ki laalkrishna adwani ne apane haalia blog main likhaa tha ki unhone rajnatik rup se asahmati rakhane waalon ko deshadroh ke rup main nahin dekha, balki unhen sirf apana pratidwandi mana he
 Advani said that the core of Indian democracy is respect for diversity and freedom of expression
 apane astitv main aane ke baad se hi bijepi ne kabhi bhi un logon ko apana dushman nahin mana, jo usase asahmati rakhte hai
 We have never even considered such people to be traitors
 unhone likhaa, 'maine hameshaa sabase pehle raashtra, iske baad party or sabase aakhir main khud ko rakhaa
 i followed this principle in all situations and will continue to do so
 ' adwani kaa yah blog us samay saamne aayaa he, jab bhartiya janata party ne gandhinagar se unka tikat kaat diya he
 He is an MP from Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat since 1991
 is baar is seat se bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah chunaav maidan main hai

 Things changed if times changed
 aaj ke vakt main dilli police main kai padon par baithe unke 'log' ab dare hue hai
 Sources are saying that that part of Delhi Police which is believed to be Alok Verma's camp, is very scared that the heat of the battle may not reach them
 verma kaa daayan haath 'ek asipi'dilli police main charchaa he ki alok verma kaa ek kareebi asipi jo us daur kaa sabase taqatvar shaks mana jaataa he or verma ke kaarykaal main usee ke paas transfar-posting jaisi jimmedaari thi, vosibiimen ladaai ke baad se hi sahamaa hua he
 There is a buzz in the tongue that the CBI can be 'spied' through some people of Delhi Police
 haalanki ye jaanch kaa vishay he
 Verma's rival camp, Activavarma, threw his camp away as soon as he became the police commissioner
 ab wo khud mushkil main hai to unki virdohi lobby sakriy ho chuki he
 Sources say that the current police commissioner Amulya Patnaik has asked his officers to stay away from the ongoing battle in the CBI

 zyaadaatar android yugers apane smartphone main file management ke liye third party ap yuj karte hai
 The most popular file management app is ES File Explorer and claims to have been downloaded 500 million times
 yah ab tak kaa sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala ap bhi he
 Through this app, users manage the files, data and documents of their smartphone or tablet
 french security research jo Robert Baptiste kaaphi popular ho chuke hai or unhone hi ab nayaa daawa kiya he
 He has made several tweets about ES File Explorer
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki ES File Explorer ko hack kiya ja saktaa he
 They have found that ES File Explorer has a hidden web server that runs in the background and anyone can hack it and steal users' information
 Robert Baptiste ne ek twit main kaha he ki 10 karod baar downlod kiya jane vaala ES File Explorer ap sabase zyada popular file manager he
 The surprising thing is that if you open this once and anyone is connected on the same network, in that case they can remotely take files from the phone to their device
 With more than 100,000,000 downloads ES File Explorer is one of the most famous # Androidfile manager
 The surprise is: if you opened the app at least once, anyone connected to the same local network can remotely get a file from your phonehttps: / / t

 In this, they extract phone numbers, images, videos, apps and other Android data
 unhone ise yuj karte hue duusare smartphone kii external memory main rakhaa data bhi colect karte hue demonstrishan kiya he
 Let us know that this drawback can only be taken advantage of when smartphone users are connected to the local network
 yani agar koi duusare network se connected he to wo aapke is ap ke jariye aapke smartphone kaa data chori nahin kar saktaa he
 However, this is also quite serious, because many people are connected to one wifi and know whether any hacker is connected to these wifi
 agar is french security research kaa daawa sahi he to yah kaaphi gambhir maamla he
 At present, no statement has come from this app and after the statement we will update you

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke grih jile main ek dalit parivaar ko apane ghar ke aage shauchalay banavaane ke liye lambi ladaai ladani padi
 The fight lasted so long that it took the family two years to build the toilet
 gujaratke jile mehsana main ek gaanv he, lakshmipura-bhandu
 It does not take long to reach the village from Mehsana, as the road is paved and in good condition
 shahar se gaanv jate hue ek sawaal mujhe baar-baar pareshaan kar rahaa he
 The question is that if a family has the ability to make toilet for themselves, they have made all the same arrangements, then how long can it take to build a toilet? Maybe five months, six months or at most a year
 usase zyada to nahin hi lag saktaa
 However, Bhikhabhai Senma, the head of the only Dalit family living in laxmipura-bhandu village, took more than two years to build a toilet for his family
 itnaa vakt isliye laga, kyonki wo dalit hai or unke aasapaas rah rahe choudhary parivaar
 The Chaudhary families had problems with their toilet making
 un do varshon main khub kagaji karrwai hui
 This whole incident came to light in February 2016
 khabaren baniin or phir jila prashasan par dabaav banane par aanan-fanan main bhikhabhai ke ghar ke passvachh bharat abhiyaanke tahat shauchalaay banwaaya gaya
 The population of this village is around five hundred and most of these houses belong to the Chaudhary caste
 bhikhabhai sanema isi gaanv main apane 13 sadasyon vaale parivaar ke saath rahete hai
 The village is home to his family at the beginning
 sadak ke bilkul kinare
 There is plenty of greenery around the house
 aage kii taraf khub saare aise paudhe lage hai, jinaki shakhaaen aapas main milakar ek diwaar-si ban gai he
 Wall of bushes
 ghar saaf-suthra he
 Everything is kept in its place by law
 ghar ke paas sarkari nal he
 There is a hut nearby, which houses dry wood for firewood
 bagal main hi mitti kaa ek bada mataka rakhaa he, mataka parivaar kaa frij he
 There is also a temple near his house, which hangs a calendar of Goddess Durga
 parivaar ke mukhiya bhikhabhai ghar par nahin hai
 He has gone out for some work, but the rest are family members
 gujarat main philhal chunaav kaa maahaul he
 One of the main reasons for approaching this Dalit family in the midst of this political atmosphere, is to know how the family that had to fight for two years to build toilets for themselves is living today? Let me also tell you that The district mehsanapm is Modi's home district and his birthplace is Vadnagar, a short distance from here
 senma mehul parivaar ke ek yuva sadsy hai or sanskrit se bie kar rahe hai
 According to him, a male member has to stay in the house at all times
 wo kehete hai, ‘ghar main kisi naa kisi mard ko rahanaa padataa he
 Dad is out now, so here i am
 ’ye sunne main thodaa ajeeb lag saktaa he, lekin aisa hi he
 According to him, some people of other caste tighten their feet while going by road
 gaaliyaan bhi dete hai
 Mehul says, 'here we drink alcohol and go on the road while speaking something
 vaise to koi hamen chedhta nahin he, lekin bhay bana rahata he
 'senma Mehul is studying Sanskrit, but no member of her family can cross the frame of the village temple and that is why she has built a temple outside her house
 inke mandir main bhi devi durga kii tasviir lagi he
 Perhaps this is the goddess Durga, a Dalit! ”says Sarita Ben, a senior in the family,“ We cannot go to their temple
 isliye hamane apana alag mandir banavaa liya he
 'it seemed right to mention that incident here, because the fear of this family's mind is clearly visible
 ghar ke ahaate main hi sarita ben se baat karnaa chaah rahe hai, lekin inaki taraf se ek ishaara hua ki baatcheet vahaan khule main naa karke andar kii jaae
 The reason is that there is a possibility of trouble if the Chaudhary families around will come to know
 (agar aap is vaakye ko dekhnaa chaahate hai to video ko 09: 32 se 10:01 minute tak dekhen)yahaan inaki abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kaa kya ho rahaa he, wo aap pathak tay karen
 There is a young girl in the family
 uskaa naam senma rinku he or yahaan iskaa nanihaal he
 Rinku is the daughter of the same place where her son is PM Modi i
e
 Rinku's ancestral residence is Vadnagar
 rinku ke pitaaji kaa kaaphi pehle nidhan ho gaya, jisaki vajah se wo apane nanihaal main rah rahi he or apane snaatak kii padhai puri kar rahi he
 There is no change in untouchability that happens to the Rinku Dalits
 aaj bhi halaat vaise hi hai
 She says, 'nothing has changed
 aaj bhi ham ek saath pani nahin bhar sakate
 You cannot go to a public temple
 agar unka koi kaarykram hota he or agar ham khaane jate hai to hamaara intjaam alag se hota he, ham vahiin khate hai
 We cannot go to their house
 ham baahar hi rahete hai
 If they have to give water to us then they give it from above
 jaisaa pehle tha, abhi bhi vahi he
 'on one side there are promises to save and teach the daughter
 betiyon ko aage badhaane kii baaten ho rahi hai, vahiin yah ladki shaam hone se pehle ghar laut aati he, kyonki agar kisi oonchi jati ke ladke-aadmi ne iske saath koi galat harakat kii or isane unke parivaar se shikaayat kii to ise kaha jaataa he ki meraa ladkaa to sharaab ke nashe main tha, aap to hosh main the naa?rinku college jaati he
 She knows all the big things that are done in books with Dalits, but when she returns to her village, the situation is completely reversed
 wo padhakar bas ek sarkari naukari chaahati he
 After the toilet is built, the family wants to have a paved wall in front of their house, so that a concrete curtain can be made between the road and their house
 philhal parade kaa kaam kuch had tak wo jhaadiyaan kar rahi hai, jo inhone lagaai hai
 Actually the family has no bathroom
 nal bhi bas daravaaje par hi laga he
 There is no problem for male members of the family, but women members have to do everything from bathing to washing clothes on this tap
 aise main parivaar kii mahilaayein nahaane ke liye andhere kaa sahaara leti hai
 The only woman in the family, Rinku goes to her college at ten in the morning, but it is only in the morning
 yah sawaal jab hamane usase poocha ki tum kab nahaati ho to wo hansate hue kahati he, ‘subah ke chaar baje
 When it remains dark
 subah hone ke baad to naha nahin sakati naa, so subah-subah andhere main hi nahaati hum
 'rinku speaks this very easily with his innocent laughter
 wo iske liye naa to kisi se shikaayat karti he or naa hi kehete hue pareshaan hoti he
 But one of his answers opens up the claims of development, which are common these days
 bhojpuri filmon ke baad ab mujeec elbum main bhi badlaav dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 a recent example of this is the recently released music album 'rajaji Kaise Mile I'

 It seemed as if you were reading poetry
 vaani prakaashan ne 2010 main ‘pandraa paanch pachhattar’ naam se gulzaar kii kavitaaon kaa sangrah prakashit kiya he
 There are fifteen recitations in this collection and five poems in each lesson
 gulzaar kaa falak bahut bada he
 In which they cover the whole work
 wo soramandal kaa chakkar kaat aate hai to iraq se lekar afghanistan tak kii khaak chaante hai
 He testifies to Khanam of Iraq and also to the houses of Gujarat which became a pile of rubble
 dekhie
 
 
 The houses of so many innocent people are burnt in riots in Gujarat
 
 
 or ye he,ek toote hue rosen main isetinke sajaane kii padi he!baaju ek julahe kaa, hilta he ab takkaanp rahaa he yaa shaayad kuch kaat rahaa hataang he ek khilaadi kii
 
 
 Is run out
 ghar tak daudte daudte raah main maaraa gaya
 It is said that walls have ears, but Gulzar also gives tongue to these walls
 
 
 suraj kii is baikalite main ghar ke khandhar
 
 
 And the Afghan children sitting on the walls, on the cover page of the 'art Journal' of America, now look alive too! Light smoke continues to emit !! a tank suddenly entered the house on the day of the gold, little by little, whatever was found
 Come here, do not worry about Khanum, Abbu Tum !! In the biggest celebration of democracy, Netaji people were recognizing their gods
 
 Gulzar opens his pole like this
 ek pahari ke kone membeste jitani basti thi ikbatwe jitna mandir tha, wo bhi lockit jitanineend bhari do baahon jaise masjid ke minar gale mandir kedo maasoom khuda soe the!ek buudhe jharne ke neeche!!sa kavy sangrah main gulzaar ek nae aks main dikhte hai
 His canvas is very big and he creates a new landscape by taking everyday small but considered things
 apni anguliyon ke poron se jab vah samvednaaon ke dhaage bunate he to har koi bich jaataa he
 Perhaps this is also the specialty of Gulzar
 barish hoti he jabato in gaare pathar kii deevaaron parabige bhiige nakshe banane lagate hanhichakee hitchkee barish tab
 
 pahachaani si ek likhaai likhti habarish kuch kah jaati he
 What does the Azim poet of our time say about children disappearing in the robbery of the city
 
 You must have seen this too, the city has a habit of raiding, if Megha Shahar is robbed, the children are carried in their pockets and the children are sold like corn on the street
 pandrah paanch pachhattar main gulzaar ne bhukh or visthaapan par bhi jamkar kalam chalaai he
 They call God an unselfish child and make him sit equal to the child who is starving
 kaal maai nenile rang ke, gol se ek sayyare paraye kah ke khuda ko chhod diyabe-sabra he ye, jald bada ho jayega!!kaal maa chuulhe par handi rakhke, kab se baithi hakache dane gal jaaen or ek ubala aa jaae!ye be-sabra baccha baithaungli rakh ke gol katori ke andargol gol thali par tej ghumata haisardaar dam kii vajah se visthaapan ke shikaar hue logon ko bhi gulzaar ne apni kalam di he
 This valley built between three mountains will be formed! Dame will be formed, creeping out of three mountains, the force that has been flowing for centuries will sit in the horoscope, now in this book Ashok Vajpayee says in this book if Gulzar is the highest in today's time He is one of the poets and poets who get love because there is no burden of poetry in his poems
 wo ek baar ek hi cheez kehete hai or unki kavitaaon main utavlaapan nahin he
 In his poems, we find our world or experience resonated
 ujaad gaetamam shab jali he shamaa hijr kii
 
 ummid bhi bachi he to bas itanijitani ek banjh kokh kii ummid hogulzaar ke yahaan har cheez jubaan liye hoti he
 And when she speaks, 'the skirts of the sky begin to cook'
 'dhoop kaa tukdaa lon main sahame hue ek parinde kii tarah baith jaataa he'
 
 'yahaan tak ki mujhe meraa jism chhodkar bah gaya nadi main
 'what is not the river, the sky, the reality? or yahi vaastaviktaa he jise gulzaar ne apni or hamaari jindagiyon main se tukdaa tukdaa uthaa liya he
 Sometimes when the eagle descends from the roof of the evening, a little bit of it stops in the lawn and starts to dissolve in white and pink, 'masunda' plants as the snowflakes melt
 In the whiskey, i remove the 'scarf' from the neck of the day
 Even after wearing it, i cut it everyday in my fragrance !! 
 i got swept away in the river leaving my body! Now i am calling on reaching that shore
 i am drowning on this shore
 How can i swim without it !! i was swept away by leaving my body !! 
 
 aakhir main bas itnaa hi kahenge ki apni kavitaaon ke madhyam se jab gulzaar ‘duaen phunkate hai’ to unke chaahane waalon ko ‘hitchkee’ aane lagati he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ne 2022 tak sabhi ke liye makaan kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya he
 Seven years remain to accomplish this goal
 iskaa matlab he ki har roj kareeb 44 hajaar yaa har saal 1
 6 crore houses to be built
 is yojana kii ghoshnaa aise vakt main kii gai he jab desh main real state sector gambhir chunautiyon ki bich mandi ke daur se guzar rahaa he or kendra sarkaar desh main aarthik gati ko teji dene ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan ke mudde par sansad main jujh rahi he
 In such a situation, there are 6 major hurdles before the central government in front of the house plan for everyone
 1
 The city has two major metropolitan cities of Delhi and Mumbai among the 10 largest metros in the world
 sanyukt raashtra ke aankade ke mutabik kolkata 2030 tak duniya ke 15 sabase bade mahanagaron main shaamil ho jayega
 According to the 2011 census, there are nine million homeless people living in cities
 iske saath hi shaharon kii jhuggiyon main 6
 5 crore people live
 sarkari aankade ke mutabik shaharon main jitne logon ko makaan chahie, unamem se 90 fisadi garib hai
 2

 According to another indiaspend report, there are around 67 crore people in villages, whose daily income is less than Rs 33
 2031 tak shaharon kii aabaadi 60 karod ho jaaegi, jo 2011 main 38 karod thi
 According to the 2007-08 National Sample Survey Organization, the proportion of people from the village to the urban population is 35%, which is quite high
 3
 According to the census, a large population of slum dwellers in the cities today is about 17% or about 6% of the cities
 5 karod kii aabaadi jhuggiyon main rahati he
 4
 mushkil se milegi jameenmakaanon kii kami puri karne ke liye kareeb do lakh hectare jameen kii jarurat hogi
 To deal with this deficiency, some experts recommend increasing the height of buildings and for this the rules of Floor Space Index (FSI) should be simplified
 mumbai main is disha main kuch sudhaar haal main hue hai
 Most of the cities of the country are quite dense, where more than ten thousand people live per square kilometer area
 5
 Living up to the standard The challenge will include more things within the housing scheme for all, such as new units, credit-linked subsidies, upgrades / construction by beneficiaries and upgrading / redevelopment of slum houses
 makaan banane kii hode main gunvattta kaayam rakhana chunauti hogi
 According to one statistic, the quality of every third house in the country is poor now
 6
 Dealing with the network of rules The biggest obstacle to the housing scheme of Nomodi will be to deal with the network of rules, including the construction approval process, which the World Bank has called the worst in the world

 However, Ban also said that any peace effort, which does not destroy the root roots of the crisis, will not be able to do much, it will only start a new cycle of violence
 baan ke pravaktaa dwaara jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya, gaja ko ek aisi vaid philstini sarkaar ke tahat laayaa janaa chahie, jo pielo (philstini libration organijeshan) kii patibaddhtaon kaa paalan kare
 The deadlock over Gaza must end, legitimate concerns regarding the security of Israel should be addressed
 unhone kaha ki gaja or israel kaa ‘ujjwal bhavishya’ ek tikaoo sangharshaviram par nirbhar karata he or is jimmedaari ko uthaanaa shaamil pakshon par nirbhar he

 sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki iske jariye cashles iconomi ko badhaava milegaa
 After this, the trend of people moved towards online transactions
 haalanki online tranjection ke badhane ke saath network connactivity or sibar suraksha jaisi chunautiyaan bhi saamne ai hai
 To tackle such challenges, the government can make some important announcements in the budget
 notebandi gemeanger sabit hua!haal hi main rigerv bank kii 'benchmarking indiaj pement systams' naam se ai ek report main bataaya gaya ki notebandi ke baad desh main i-mani kaa prachlan badha tha
 According to the report, 345 in the year 2017
 9 karod i-mani len-dein ke saath bharat keval japan or america se peeche he
 In this report, demonetisation has been described as a 'gamechanger' for e-money

 Online transactions have made life of ordinary people less difficult than it has been

 Apart from internet and network connectivity, lack of smartphones is also a major problem
 vahiin online tranjection par lagane vaale charge yaa limit ke niyamon kii vajah se bhi yugers kii pareshaani bad jaati he
 Relief has been received on RTGS and NEFT, however, recently, to promote online transactions, the Reserve Bank of India has removed the transaction charges levied under RTGS (real Time Gross Settlement Online Transaction) and NEFT (national Electronic Fund Transfer)
 RTGS kaa istemaal mukhyat: badi raashi ko transfar karne ke liye hota he
 Under this, a minimum amount of Rs 2 lakh can be sent and there is no limit for sending the maximum amount
 vahiin NEFT ke tahat fund transfar kaa setlement ek nishchit samay par hota he
 If you understand in easy language, the fund you have transferred will not reach you immediately

 Motilal Vora, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member, raised the matter of cutting salaries of ISRO scientists in Rajya Sabha on July 30 today
 unhone kaha ki jab puraa desh chandrayan-2 kii lonching ke baad isro vaigyanikon kii safalataa par unhen badhai de rahaa he, aise main bharat sarkaar unki selary kaat rahi he
 Two additional increments for ISRO scientists were given by the President
 taaki desh main maujuud behtareen talents ko isro vaigyanik banane kaa protsaahan mili
 Also, ISRO scientists could also be inspired
 motilal vora ne kaha ki ye atirikt vetan vruddhi supreme court ke aadesh ke baad 1996 main antariksh vibhaag ne lagu kiya tha
 The Supreme Court had said in the order that this increment should be clearly considered as 'salary'
 motilal vora ne sadan main apil kii ki centre sarkaar isro vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah na kaate
 Read
 
 
 ajtak ne sabase pehle bataaya tha ki sarkaar ne kaat lee isro vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahisaro vaigyanikon ke sanghathan dwaara isro chif ko likhi gai chitthee
 The Government of India had cut the salary of ISRO scientists just before the launch of Chandrayaan-2
 centre sarkaar ne 12 june 2019 ko jari ek aadesh main kaha he ki isro vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ko saal 1996 se do atirikt vetan vruddhi ke rup main mil rahi, protsaahan anudaan raashi ko band kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the situation when the whole country is proud of the achievements of ISRO scientists
 isro ke vaigyanikon ke sanghathan spes ejiniers association (SEA) ne isro ke chairman dow
 K
 sivan ko patr likhakar maang kii thi ki ve isro vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah main katautee karne vaale centre sarkaar ke aadesh ko radd karne main madad karen
 Because scientists have no other means of earning other than salary
 SEA ke adhyaksh e
 Maniraman had said in a letter to the ISRO chief that no deduction in the salary of a government employee can be made until a very serious situation arises
 tankhwaah main katautee hone se vaigyanikon ke utsaah main kami aegi
 We are extremely shocked and saddened by the decision of the Scientific Central Government
 ISRO vaigyanikon kii chittheeh ham hairat main hai or behad dukhi bhi
 
 
 SEA has made these demands point-wise in a letter to the ISRO Chief
 
 
 isro vaigyanikon ke liye do atirikt vetan vruddhi kii anumati raashtrapati ne di thi
 So that the best talent present in the country is encouraged to become ISRO scientist
 saath hi isro vaigyanik bhi prerit ho sake
 These additional increments were implemented by the Department of Space in 1996 following a Supreme Court order
 supreme court ke aadesh main kaha tha ki is vetan vruddhi ko spasht taur par 'tankhwaah' mana jaae
 The Sixth Pay Commission also recommended continuation of this increment
 saath hi kaha gaya tha ki iskaa laabh isro vaigyanikon ko milte rahanaa chahie
 Two additional increments were implemented so that the young scientists coming to ISRO could get inspiration at the time of appointment and they could work for a long time in ISRO
 centre sarkaar ke aadesh main parformens related incentive skim (PRIS) kaa zikr he
 We would like to point out that both the additional increment and PRIS are completely different
 ek incentive he, jabaki doosraa tankhwaah he
 The two do not fill each other in any way
 sarkari karmchaaree kii tankhwaah main kisi bhi tarah kii katautee tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak behad gambhir sthiti na khadi ho jaae
 This was the central government's salary-cutting order
it said that this incentive amount will be stopped from July 1, 2019
 is aadesh ke baad D, E, f or g shrenee ke vaigyanikon ko yah protsaahan raashi ab nahin milegi
 ISRO has about 16 thousand scientists and engineers
 lekin is sarkari aadesh se isro ke kareeb 85 se 90 fisadi vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron kii tankhwaah main 8 se 10 hajaar rupye kaa nuksaan hoga
 Because most scientists fall into these categories
 ise lekar isro vaigyanik naaraaz hai
 Explain that this incentive amount was started in the year 1996 to encourage scientists, increase their inclination towards ISRO and not leave the institute
 centre sarkaar kii ore se jari aadesh main kaha gaya he ki chathe vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par vitt mantralay or vyay vibhaag ne antariksh vibhaag ko salaah di he ki vah is protsaahan raashi ko band kare
 Instead, only the Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) has been implemented
 ab tak isro apane vaigyanikon ko protsaahan raashi or PRIS skim donon suvidhaayen de rahaa tha
 But now the central government has decided that this incentive amount given as additional salary will stop getting from July 1
 c shrenee main hoti he isro vaigyanikon kii bhartee, pramotion par milti thi protsaahan raashiisro main kisi vaigyanik kii bhartee c shrenee se shuru hoti he
 They are then promoted to D, E, F, g and so forth
 har shrenee main pramotion se pehle ek test hota he
 Those who pass it get this incentive grant money
 lekin ab jab july kii tankhwaah agast main aegi, tab vaigyanikon ko usamen katautee dikhegi
 The most important fast in fasting is of Ekadashi
 ekadshi kaa niyamit vrath rakhane se man ki chanchalta samaapt hoti he
 Wealth and health are attained, problems related to hormones are also corrected and psychiatry is also overcome
 putrada ekadshi kaa vrath santan prapti tathaa santan kii samasyaon ke nivaaran ke liye kiya jane vaala vrath he
 Putra Ekadashi of Sawan is considered to be particularly fruitful
 is upwas ko rakhane se santan sambandhi har chintaa or samasya kaa nivaaran ho jaataa he
 This time Sawan's Putrada Ekadashi is on 11 August
 kya hai is vrath ko rakhane ke niyam ?- yah vrath do prakaar se rakhaa jaataa he-nirjal vrath or falahari yaa jaleey vrath
 In general, waterless fasting should be kept completely healthy
 - anya yaa saamaanya logon ko falahari yaa jaleey upwas rakhana chahie
 - It would be better to consume only water and fruits on this day
 - santan sambandhi manokamanaayon ke liye is ekadshi ke din bhagavan krishna yaa shri narayan kii upasna kerani chahie
 What to do for the wish of children? - In the morning, husband and wife jointly worship Shri Krishna
 - unhen pile fal, pile phool, tulsi dal or panchamrita arpit karen
 - After this, chant the progeny Gopal Mantra
 - mantra jaap ke baad pati patni sanyukt rup se prasad grahan karen
 - It would be better if fasting procedures are followed on this day
 kya he santan gopal mantra ?- " clin devaki sut govind vasudev jagatpate , dehi me tanyan krishna twamaham sharanam gata"- " clin krishnaay namah" The Delhi government claims to have spent crores in the capital in the name of education
 lekin kaig kii report ne sarkaar ke daavon kii hawa nikaal di he
 However, the Education Minister is questioning the CAG report itself
 shiksha mantri arvinder singh lavali ke mutabik dilli ke skulon main shiksha ke intjaamon main koi kami nahin he
 According to the CAG report, there are only two teachers to teach 700 children in a school in Ambedkar Nagar in South Delhi
 karodon kii laagat se bane is skool ke khule hue kareeb ek saal ho gaye lekin chaatr ab tak teacheron kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 BJP councilors of the area are also cursing the Sheila government for this plight
 bhaajapa parshad kushi ram kaa kahana he ki ambedkar nagar main sarvoday bidhaalay he jisamen sirf ek teacher or ek principal he, usko khule hue ek varsh ho gaya he jo ki badi dukhad baat he
 The declining level of education is in front of Sheila Dixit
 bacchon kii shiksha yahaan par ram bharose he or sarkaar he ki kuch karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 The Sheila government claims to have spent crores in the name of Right to Education, but in reality these claims are proving to be hollow
 kaig kii report ne bhi in daavon kii pole khol di lekin shila sarkaar ke mantri to kaig kii report par bhi sawaal uthaane se nahin chook rahe
 In Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, 47 children have died in 10 days due to chum fever
 yah maamla ab antarrashtriya media main bhi aa gaya he
 According to reports published in the English website Daily Mail and The Guardian, the children died due to a poisonous substance found in lychee
 report ke mutabik marane vaale sabhi bacchon main acute inseflitis syndrome ke lagbhag ek samaan lakshan paae gaye hai
 Sugar levels have also been found to be below average in the blood samples of all these children
 mujffarpur ke jin do aspataalon se bacchon kii maut kii khabaren ai hai, wo ilaake lichi ke baagon ke liye kaaphi jane jate hai
 Litchi is produced here on a large scale and after that it is transported in India and abroad
 isliye is vishay kii jaanch karnaa ab bahut jaruri ho gaya he ki kya sach main lichi main paae jane vaale jahrile tatv ke kaaran hi bacchon kii maut ho rahi he
 Senior health officer of the district Ashok Kumar Singh told the English website that similar symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome have been found in the dead children
 bacchon ke khun main bhi sugar kii maatra kaaphi kam thi
 The official said that the poisonous substance which killed the children is found in lychee
 vahiin, shrikrishna medical college evam aspataal ke chif medical officer espisi singh ne daily mail or da gargian ke hawaale se kaha ki 40 bacchon main inseflitis ke lagbhag ek jaise lakshan paae gaye hai
 a separate care unit has also been created to treat the afflicted children
 philhal bacchon kii haalat kaaphi gambhir he or inhen bachaane ke liye ve puraa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The problem has increased in 24 years - this case is not new in Muzaffarpur and its neighboring districts of Bihar
 saal 1995 se yahaan garmiyon ke mausam main aisi shikaayatein lagaataar aa rahi hai
 That is, this problem has increased a lot in the last 24 years
 ashok kumaar singh ne bataaya ki taapmaana 40 degree ke paar pahunchane ke baad health department yahaan pehle hi adwijuri jari kar chukaa he
 What the researchers say - In local areas of Bihar, this disease is called chummi fever
 saal 2014 main bhi is bukhaar ke kareeb 150 maamle saamne aae the
 In 2015, this fatal fever in the brain was also discovered by American researchers
 shodh main pataa laga ki is jahrile padaarth kaa sambandh kisi fal se ho saktaa he
 Recently, according to the report of the World Health Organization, half-litchi was also said to be dangerous for humans
 lichi main paae jane vaala ek vishesh prakaar kaa tatv is bukhaar kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Why litchi is dangerous - delicious and sweet litchi can cause someone's death, this argument is a little hard to believe
 lekin lichi khaane main agar kuch baton kaa vishesh dhyaan na rakhaa jaae to yah khatarnaak ho sakati he
 Taking an empty stomach and raw litchi greatly increases the risk of encephalitis
 yadi aap khaali pet lichi khaakar so jaaen to bhi yah khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he
 The toxic substance released from litchi reduces the average amount of sugar in the body
 iske alaava kuposhit bacchon ko bhi lichi nahin khaani chahie
 What is the cure - Do not let the lack of water in the body of a person suffering from fever
 bacchon ko sirf healdi food hi den
 After eating food at night, give light sweet
 civil sarjan espi singh ke mutabik chamaki grast bacchon main hypoglaysemia yani sugar kii kami dekhi ja rahi he
 At present, all primary health centers in the district have been put on high alert
 yahaan chamaki bukhaar se peedit bacchon ke ilaaj ke liye samuchit vyavastha kii gai he
 Doctors say that after a while keep giving fluids to the children so that there is no lack of water in their body

 com / dqd790jngp hyderabad uniwarsity ke chaatr rohit wemula kii khudakushi maamle kii jaanch ke liye kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay dwaara bheje gaye do adhikariyon ke khilaaf vahaan ke chaatro ne 'waapas jaao, waapas jaao' ke naare lagaae
 About two hours later, BJP spokesperson Prakash Reddy also faced a similar protest
 rohit kii khudakushi se gussaye chaatro ko dekhte hue unhen uniwarsity campus se baahar jane par majaboor hona pad gaya
 University students say that they do not want this sad death of Rohit to be used politically
 haalanki iske baavjood vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ne vishvavidhyalay kaa daura kiya
 Among them was Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who went to meet Rohit's mother today and then addressed the students sitting on the dharna
 congress upaadhyaksh ne yahaan kaha ki shiksha mantri smriti irani or vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati appa raav ko rohit kii maut kaa jimmedaar mana jaae
 bjp's ally LJP leader and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter
 unhone kaha ki unhone apni party netaaon kii ek team hyderabad bheji he or unke lautne ke baad vah pradhanmantri se milenge
 Comments Rohit committed suicide on Sunday night
 vah un paanch shodh chaatro main shaamil tha, jinhen pichley saal agast main uniwarsity ne nilambit kar diya tha, saath hi unki fellowship bhi roak di gai thi
 It is alleged that action was taken against the students after pressure from two Union ministers Smriti Irani and Bandaru Dattatreya
 dalit chaatr kii khudakushi ke maamle main raajnneetik mode tab aayaa jab kendriya mantri bandaaru dattatreya ke khilaaf police cese register kar liya gaya
 He was accused of inciting suicide by a letter written in August
 pichley saal 17 agast ko likhe letters main, dattatreya ne aarope lagaaya tha ki vishvavidhyalay abivipi ke ek kaaryakarta par hamale ko 'khamoshi se dekhtaa rahaa'
 In the letter, the university has even been called a stronghold of 'extremists, racists and anti-national politics'
 haalanki uniwarsity dwaara ek jaanch samiti ne rohit samet sabhi ko praathmik jaanch main nirdosh qaraar diya tha
 But later the university had reversed its decision
 uniwarsity ke chaatro kaa kahana he ki ve nahin chaahate ki rohit kii is dukhad maut kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho

 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni openly blamed Virat Kohli for the defeat in Kanpur ODI
 ab ek or baat khul kar aa rahi he ki is match se pehle in donon ke bich joardaar bahes hui thi
 On the eve of the first ODI between India and South Africa in Kanpur on Sunday, the debate between Dhoni and Kohli over the inclusion of Ajinkya Rahane in the team
 match ke dauraan bhi kohli jab boundry par fielding kar rahe the or dhoni ne unhen sthaan parivartan karne ko kaha to unhone use gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Team India lost that match by five runs
 haalankjinkya rahanantim ekadash main shaamil bhi kiye gaye or unhone apane chayan ko sarthak sabit karte hue behad mahatvapurn 60 ran bhi banaae
 He also formed a crucial partnership of 149 runs for the second wicket with Rohit Sharma (150)
 rahane par bhide donon captainrahane ko antim ekadash main shaamil kiye jane par jaankaar jitne hairaan the usase kahin zyada hairaan rahane ko kohli se upar tisare kram par bhejne se the
 At the time of the team's announcement, a fourth order was set for Rahane
 jis vakt shikhar dhawan out hue the us samay bharat ne 42 ran banaae the or rohit acha khel rahe the, aise main rahane se adhik pratibhashali kohli ko rokna or rahane ko bhejnaa sabko hairaan karata he
 After the match, when the reporters wanted to know about Dhoni's relationship with Kohli, he denied it
 dhoni ne match se pehle samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha tha ki rahane ke liye team main abhi koi slot khaali nahin he kyonki swaabhaavik taur par vah pehle, duusare yaa tisare kram khilaadi hai lekin abhi hamaari team main ye teenon slot book hai
 The captain also said that it would be disheartening to feed Rahane in the fourth or lower order as he is naturally a top-order player
 aise main unka kanpur main khel paanaa sambhav nahin dikh rahaa
 The media had given prominence to the news the next day and also agreed that Rahane would not be a part of the playing XI in Kanpur
 iske baavjood rahane ko team main shaamil kiya gaya or tisare kram par utaara gaya
 This was followed by a dramatic scene in the grounds
 long of par fielding karne ke dauraan kohli ne us ore ke stand ke darshakon ko haath upar uthaakar utsahit kiya
 This was the time when Abraham de Villiers and Faf du Plessis were taking news of Indian bowlers
 kohli ne nahin maani dhoni kii batdarshak bich-bich main 'kohli-kohli' kaa naaraa bhi lagaate
 Meanwhile, on some occasions Dhoni even hinted at him to change his place but Kohli did not take him seriously
 vah apane liye janamat sangrah karne main jute rahe
 After the match, Dhoni made up for this by dragging Kohli
 naam na lete hue dhoni ne kaha ki hamen 35 overon ke aasapaas teji se ran banane chahie the
 It is worth noting that in that match, Kohli scored 11 runs from 18 balls and his wicket fell on the final ball of the 40th over at a total of 214 runs
 isse saaf he ki dhoni ne kohli ko nishane par lene kii koi kasar nahin chodi
 The reason for this is simple
 jab se dhoni ne yah bayaan diya tha ki rahane strike rotate nahin karte or is kaaran vah ekadivasiy team ke liye feet nahin hai, dhoni or kohli main matbhed shuru ho gaya tha
 As Test captain Kohli fed Rahane in every match and Rahane also lived up to the captain's expectations
 vah teenon forment ke safal khilaadi hai
 In such a situation, why Dhoni made a strange statement about Rahane
 jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa karte hue vah rahane ko baahar or apane 'chahete' khilaadiyon ko andar rakhana chaahate the
 Dhoni included Rahane under pressure
 The inclusion of Rahane in the team in Kanpur seemed to be Dhoni's detailed thinking and decision taken in the team interest but it turned out to be something else
 asal baat yah he ki match purv sandhya par team prabandhan kii baithak main team nideshak ravi shastri ne dhoni se rahane ko team main shaamil karne ko kaha kyonki vah achche farm main hai
 Dhoni expressed his inability but agreed on the condition that Kohli would have to go to number-4
 kohli thode naa-nukur ke baad is par maan gaye lekin maidan main unka balla ruuth gaya
 Now his bat is intentionally angry or something else, only Virat can tell it but India lost this match
 or phir yah bhi charchaa aam he ki board is siries ke nattejey ke aadhaar par bataur ekadivasiy captain dhoni ke bhavishya kaa faisla karegaa
 Is it not that Virat does not want India to win this series? Ganguly has confirmed the differences
 Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has discussed this debate between Dhoni and Kohli on Facebook
 ganguli ke mutabik team ke do senior khilaadiyon kii bich is tarah kaa sambandh hona acchhee baat nahin he
 This will hurt the team and it is very shocking
 bachapan se hi maaen bacchon ko doodh pine ke liye daantati bhi hai or iske phaayde bataa kar samajhaati bhi hai
 Milk contains vitamins A, k and B12, thymine and nicotinic acid, minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium and potassium, which is very beneficial for bones and it gives us strength
 aksar dekha gaya he ki bacchon ko to ham doodh pine par bahut jor dete hai lekin ghar ke anya sadasyon ko par doodh ke maamle main utana dhyaan nahin dete
 While in old age, drinking milk is as important as in childhood
 vahiin log apane confort ke hisaab se doodh pite hai jaisebacchon ko doodh naashte main diya jaataa haito bade-bujurg doodh raat main sone se pehle pinaa pasand karte hai
 Everyone has a dilemma about what is the right time to drink milk
 kai log kehete hai doodh naashte ke saath pinaa acha hota he to kai log ise raat main pinaa sahi samajhate hai
 However, if milk is consumed during the day, it gives us energy throughout the day and if taken at night, it helps to calm the mind and get good sleep
 vahiin ayurveda raat main doodh pine ko praathamikta detaa he
 If you are also in dilemma about the right time to drink milk, then know these important things
 
 
 kya hota jab aap alag-alag samay par doodh pite hai
 
 
 Morning: Due to heavy digestion, drinking milk in the morning is forbidden, but it is believed that by drinking milk at this time, energy remains in the body throughout the day
 dopaher:dopaher ke samay doodh pinaa bujurgon ke liye phydemand hota he kyonki isse sharir ko takat milti he
 Evening: Drinking milk in the evening is considered very good for the eyes
 raat:raat ko doodh pinaa sabase acha mana jaataa he kyonki isse sharir kii din bhar kii thakaan mitati he or neend acchhee aati he
 These are the benefits of drinking milk at night - The presence of amino acids called tryptophan in milk helps to increase the level of sleep hormones
 isi kaaran se raat ko doodh pine se acchhee neend aati he
 - Milk is a good source of calcium, which helps in strengthening bones
 - doodh main protein hota he jo ki mansapeshiyon ke vikaas ke liye laabhadaayak hota he
 Some important things to know before drinking milk - People suffering from weak digestion, skin problems, cough, indigestion and stomach worms should avoid consuming milk
 - doodh ko kabhi bhi bhojan ke saath nahin pinaa chahie kyonki yah jald hajam nahin ho paata
 It should always be heated and drunk separately
 - ayurveda ke anusaar raat kosone se pehle doodh pine ke liye jaruri heki aap shaam ke bhojan ke do ghante baad hi ise pien taaki aapako raat ko doodh pine kaa laabh mil sake

 jab 1995 batch ke iees adhikari ajay kumaar singh april 2007 main desh kii koyala rajdhani kahe jane vaale dhanbad ke dipti kamishnar banakar aae, to unke saamne chunautiyon kaa ambara tha
 The Jharia Coal Field resembled a giant pit
 barood se bhare peepe kii tarah jo dadhakati aag par rakhaa ho
 Under normal circumstances, the villagers would have given up their lives years ago to save their lives, but were forced to live there to live
 vahaan 53,000 pariwaron main se adhikansh ke liye koyala jamaa karnaa or use bazaar main bechnaa hi jeevika kaa ekmaatr jariya tha
 The government tried to resettle them elsewhere, but they refused
 kisi anya adhikari ke liye unhen kahin or basaane ke kaam main sara samay nikal jaataa
 It was not easy for Ajay Singh either
 unhone un logon ke liye kuch anya samasyaon par bhi dhyaan diya
 He listened intently to the problems of old pensioners
 aam taur par bahut se adhikari unki upeksha karte rahe hai
 B
 in Computer Science
 tech kii degree rakhane vaale ajay ke saamne pensionbhogiyon kii shikayaton kaa ambara lagata ja rahaa tha
 Whenever he visited these villages, people used to come to him with pension related complaints and told their problems
 ajay kehete hai, “pensionbhogi vruddh log hamaare samaaj main shaayad sabase zyada asurakshit hai
 In most cases their children are living outside and they do not pay attention to their old parents
 isliye pensionbhogiyon ko khud hi apana khyaal rakhana padataa he
 When Ajay studied the pension system in depth, he was surprised
 unhone paaya ki pension kii delivery main bilkul bhi paardarshita nahin thi, jabaki jile main 376 karmchaaree is vibhaag se jude the
 The pension amount went through 11 levels and 32 procedures before reaching the pensioner
 is puri kasarat main 51 din lag jate the
 Also, corruption was also high due to lack of transparency in the pension delivery system
 is par nigaraanee rakhana lagbhag asambhav tha, kyonki saare record haath se likhe jate the
 The entire process used to be very late
 sabase badi samasya nae pensionbhogi ko pension manjuur hone main hoti thi kyonki unke bare main kisi tarah kii koi soochna hi maujuud nahin hoti thi
 Ajay took the support of the National Informatics Center (NIC) and software experts to tackle this problem so that a new system could be built
 yah bahut mushkil kaam tha kyonki sarkaar ke delivery system main kisi tarah kaa badlaav karne ke liye vibhinn staron par manjuuri lene kii jarurat thi
 But Ajay did not give up and he succeeded in creating a new system
 unhone is nae system ko “swaavlamban” naam diya
 In this electronically operated system, the pension amount would come directly from the state headquarters to the local fund, from where it would reach the designated banks
 uske baad bank pensionbhogi ke khate main paise daal dete
 In this way, it would take only seven days to reach the pensioner from the state headquarters
