 tamilnadu vidhansabha main rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron kii faansee ke kilaaf or unhen chhodane ke liye sarvasammati se prastaav paas hua to hamaari samuhik chetana uttar bharat main hone ke kaaran chennai pahunch hi nahin saki
 But as soon as the news came that the proposal against the hanging of Afzal Guru could be passed in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, the collective consciousness immediately started dancing all over North India
 vahaan prastaav to paas nahin hua lekin punjab main jab rajoana kii faansee kaa virodh hua to samuhik chetana chuttee manaane kalka mail se shimla chali gai
 The comments march 2012 main balavant singh rajoana kii faansee ke virodh main akali dal ne punjab band kaa aahvaan kiya
 Congress state president Captain Amarinder Singh also opposed the hanging and the Akali Dal did it
 bijepi ne kabhi apni line nahin badali magar kabhi apana dost nahin badla
 The BJP still supports hanging but also gives the opposition a place in its government
 balavant singh rajoana jis aatankwaadi hamale main doshi paye gaye the usamen mukhyamantri sahit 17 log maare gaye the
 At that time Rajoana also wrote a letter that i do not need any help from the Akali Dal leaders
 inhone sikhon ko nyaay dilaane ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 History will never forgive the Akali Dal
 phir bhi akali dal ne samarthan kiya or faansee kii sazaa umr kaid main badali
 Today we are with the Akali Dal, Congress, BJP and CPM leaders with whom we will talk if they have the courage to protest against the execution of the frenzy like a few lawyers
 faansee kaa virodh hona he to yah jimmaa do chaar vakeelon ke kandhe par kyon hai
 Why don't political parties clear their line
 kya hamaari raajnneeti tathakthith samuhik chetana se ghabraati he
 We should understand that the leaders and parties are under pressure and fear of strong public opinion, perhaps even Shashi Tharoor may have stayed but his tweet right after hanging is no less adventurous
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki 'dukhi hum ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko lataka diya he
 State sponsored murder turns all of us into murderers too
 main kisi cese kii merit par tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum, use supreme court ko tay karnaa he
 The problem is with the hanging
 ham aatankwaad se zarur laden lekin is tarah kii hatya se kahin bhi aatankwaad nahin rukaa he
 ' congress shashi tharur kii line ke sahare aage bad sakati thi magar party jaanati he samuhik chetana kii raajnneeti main tharur tip ke netaa feet nahin baithte
 If he says something in London, the Prime Minister is also shocked, but in India, if he speaks against the wind, then everyone starts looking left and right
 congress party ke pravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne kaha ki 67 saal se desh main faansee dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he
 It is given only in the rarest of rare cases
 isamen badlaav kii koi baat party nahin kar sakati
 If the whole parliament wants it can consider it
 jab tak ye dand vidhaan kaa hissaa he iskaa puri tarah se anupaalan hona chahie
 So the Congress will express its opinion only when the Parliament gives its opinion
 aap bataaiye ki bina partiyon kii raay ke kya sansad apni raay pehle bataa sakati he
 Was his compulsion to distance himself from Shashi Tharoor's statement because of that so-called collective consciousness
 is samuhik chetana ko bhi thik se samajhnaa chahie
 It is true that the number of those who supported the hanging is not small, but it is also true that by taking advantage of them, those who spread the hysteria are not less
 meri raay main teen tarah kaa tabaka faansee kii sazaa ke samarthan main sakriy he
 One section has been a supporter of the execution of the sentence, while there has been a section which is opposed to the hanging but there is support for hanging in cases like terrorism
 in donon tabake kaa laabh ek tisare tabake ne uthaaya
 People in this section have started making space for their politics under the pretext of hanging supporters, many parties and people of both communities doing so
 jab afzal guru ko faansee hui thi tab sipiem ke mukhpatr pipuls demokrasi ne likhaa tha ki afazal kii faansee se kashmir main algaavvaad or badhegaa
 Whereas Sitaram Yechury said that the law did its job
 jo maamla 11 saal se atka tha uskaa ant hua
 In a way it was an honor and a welcome, but this time the CPM was speaking against the execution from the beginning
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki hamaari party maanati he ki faansee kii sazaa nahin honi chahie
 We want it to change, change the definition of life
 
 
 
 Life imprisonment should mean jail till the last day of life
 
 
 abhi umraqaid main keval 14 saal hi jail kii sazaa hoti he

 When the Tamil Nadu Assembly passed a unanimous resolution against the hanging of Rajiv Gandhi's killers and released them, our collective consciousness could not reach Chennai due to being in North India
 lekin jaise hi khabar ai ki jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main afazal guru kii faansee ke kilaaf prastaav paas ho saktaa he to turant samuhik chetana puure uttar bharat main naachne lagi
 The proposal did not pass there, but when there was protest against the hanging of Rajoana in Punjab, the collective consciousness went to Shimla from Kalka Mail to celebrate the holiday
 tippaniyan In March 2012, Akali Dal called for a Punjab bandh to protest against the hanging of Balwant Singh Rajoana
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh captain amarinder singh ne bhi faansee kaa virodh kiya or akali dal ne to kiya hi
 BJP never changed its line but never changed its friend
 bijepi aaj bhi faansee kaa samarthan karti he magar virodh karne vaale ko apni sarkaar main jagah bhi detii he
 In the terrorist attack in which Balwant Singh Rajoana was convicted, 17 people including the Chief Minister were killed
 us vakt rajoana ne ek patr bhi likhaa tha ki mujhe akali dal ke netao se koi madad nahin chahie
 They have done nothing to bring justice to the Sikhs
 itihaas akali dal ko kabhi maaf nahin karegaa
 Nevertheless, the Akali Dal supported and the death sentence was hanged
 aaj ham akali dal, congress, bijepi or sipiem netaaon ke saath hai jinase baat karenge ki kya unamem saahas he ki ve un chand vakeelon kii tarah unmaad kaa shikaar hote hue bhi faansee kaa virodh kar sakate hai
 The Congress could move forward with the line of Shashi Tharoor, but the party knows that the leaders of the Tharoor type do not fit into the politics of collective consciousness
 landan main wo koi baat kah de to pradhanmantri ko bhi janch jaati he magar bharat main hawa ke khilaaf bol den to sab daaen baayen dekhne lagate hai
 Congress Party spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said that hanging has been part of the penal law in the country for 67 years
 ye reerest of rer cese main hi di jaati he
 The party cannot talk of any change in it
 agar puri sansad chaahe to is par vichaar kar sakati he
 As long as it is part of the penal legislation, it should be fully compliant
 to congress apni raay tabhi bataaegi jab sansad apni raay bataaegi
 You can tell that without the opinion of the parties, can the Parliament give its opinion first
 shashi tharur ke bayaan se duuri banane kii uski majaburi kya us tathakthith samuhik chetana ke kaaran thi
 This collective consciousness should also be understood properly
 yah sahi he ki faansee kaa samarthan karne waalon kii taadaad kam nahin he lekin yah bhi sahi he ki unka laabh uthaakar unmaad failaane vaale bhi kam nahin hai
 In my opinion, three types of sections are active in support of capital punishment
 ek tabaka faansee kii sazaa kaa samarthak rahaa he to ek aisa tabaka bhi rahaa jiskaa faansee se to virodh he magar aatankwaad jaise maamalon main faansee kaa samarthan he
 a third section took advantage of these two sections
 is tabake main shaamil log faansee ke samarthakon ke bahaane apni raajnneeti ke liye jagah banane lage hai, aisa karne vaale kai dalon main or donon samudaay ke log hai

 The Vijay Mallya, who once used to be jealous of his life of racy and flamboyance, today there is an uproar from the road to Parliament with the same Mallya

 The story of Vijay Mallya, popularly known as Liquor King, seems completely filmy
 bainkon ke 'NPA' sankat ke pratik banesharab udyog se teji se paisa banane vaale maalya aaj bank udyog ke 'nan parforming asset' sankat ke pratikban gaye hai
 Vijay Mallya used to be called 'king of Good Times', but today it has been consolidated

 Born in Kolkata, Mallya's father Vitthal Mallya was also a well-known businessman of the country
 unki mata kaa naam lalita ramaiya he
 Mallya inherited the liquor business from father Vitthal Mallya
 unhone desh ke pratishthit management sansthaanon se logon ko chunaa or is sharaab udyog ko ek karporate rup diya
 Trying to change the image in many fields, the information states that Vijay Mallya wanted people to know him not as a big wine businessman but as an industrialist
 kyonki bharat main sharaab vyavsaay ko acchhee nazaron se nahin dekha jaataa
 So perhaps Mallya invested in engineering, fertilizer, television and charter airline companies
 airlines par khub paise udaaemalya ne jab kingfisher airline shuru kiya to khub paise udaae
 When a passenger missed a flight, they used to send it to another destination from another airline
 unhone yah maan liya ki log unke flying five star hotel par tut padenge
 Mallya says - He ordered expensive foreign magazines and magazines for the passengers, but perhaps he could never get out of the warehouse
 company kemunafe par in baton kaa bura asarpadana hi tha
 The habit of making decisions in a jolt: Mallya kept getting into trouble due to the decision to take some decisions in business and the habit of buying new companies in a jolt and many times without taking a decision on the ledger

 There is a famous story about Mallya calling Gopinath from his yacht that he wants to buy air decks
 gopinath ne kaha, ek hajaar karod rupye
 Mallya did not even look at the Air Deccan balance sheet and sent a demand draft to Gopinath
 naa karj liya naa hi difaltermalya ye kehete rahe hai ki kingfisher airlines, esbiai capital markets or ek mashhoor antarrashtriya vimaanan salaahkaar se salaah mashvira ke baad shuru kii gai thi
 The state of the economy and government policies at that time were the reasons for the company's plight
 vijay maalya ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'vyaktigat taur par maine karj nahin liye hai auran hi main difolter hum
 Today, Mallya's image as a defaulter has become the reason for luxury life and real jealousy
 likar king ke naam se mashhoor vijay maalya vyapaar se zyada apni lagjri life, daulat or shoharat ko lekar charchaa main rahete the
 Apart from absconding cars, yachts, horse races with a loan of 9 thousand crores, 17 banks have a debt of around 9 thousand crores on Famous Mallya for following different looks

 This session of the SP is taking place at a time when the cycle of war between Akhilesh and Shivpal factions is going on in the party
 philhal halaat akhilesh ke paksh main najar aa rahe hai
 It was believed that Mulayam, who had disassociated himself from all matters of SP, would announce the formation of a separate party or front at a press conference in Lucknow on 25 September, but he refused to do so and gave a shock to the Shivpal camp
 mulaayam ke sahare ‘samaajawaadee secular morche’ ke gathan kii ummid lagaaye shivpal par ab apni raah chunane kaa dabaav he
 Those close to Shivpal say that after the national session of SP, he can take a decision
 (inputs bhashaa se ) sapa kaa yah adhiveshan aise samay ho rahaa he jab party main akhilesh or shivpal dhadon main rassakashi kaa daur jari he
 At present, the situation seems to be in favor of Akhilesh
 mana ja rahaa tha ki khud ko sapa ke tamaam maamalon se alag kar chuke mulaayam gat 25 sitambar ko lakhanu main hue samvaadadaata sammelan main alag party yaa morche ke gathan kii ghoshnaa karenge, lekin unhone aisa karne se inkaar kar shivpal kheme ko karaara jhatka diya
 With the help of Mulayam, Shivpal hopes to set up a 'socialist Secular Front', now there is pressure on him to choose his path
 shivpal ke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki sapa ke rashtriya adhiveshan ke baad vah koi faisla le sakate hai

 Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, the Lok Sabha candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who has made objectionable remarks on the martyrdom of Hemant Karkare, who lost his life in the terrorist attack, has now given a statement regarding the Babri Masjid
 sadhvi pragna ne kaha he ki babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraane par unhen afsos nahin, balki garv hota he
 Sadhvi Pragya, who is contesting from Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket in front of Congress's Digvijay Singh, has faced severe charges of terror, for which she has to undergo a long sentence in jail
 ab bijepi ne unhen chunaav ladaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Many controversies have come to light since Sadhvi got the ticket
 sadhvi pragna ne haal hi main 2008 ke mumbai hamale main shahid hue tatkaaleen aties chif hemanth karkare par aapattijanak tippanee kii thi
 Questioning Karkare's martyrdom, he even talked about cursing him
 haalanki, iske baad jab kirakiri hui to unhone maafee bhi maangi, lekin ab chunaav prachaar ke bich pragna thakur ne babari masjid kaa mudda garma diya he
 On the question of whether there is any regret over the demolition of the Babri Masjid structure in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992, Sadhvi Pragya Singh said, 'why would we regret bringing down the structure, we are proud of it
 ram ke mandir par apshisht padaarth the, unhen hamane hataa diya
 This has awakened the pride of our country and we will celebrate the grand Ram temple '
 unhone khud ye daawa kiya he ki wo babari masjid kaa dhaancha giraane main shaamil thim
 But on the question of why the Ram temple could not be built in the last five years, Sadhvi Pragya said, 'look at the time it has been 70 years, what have they done and our devasthan too could not be safe
 hinduon ne ikatthe hokar swabhimaan ko jaagrit kiya he dhaancha todakar or bhavy mandir bana karke aradhana karenge'
 Sadhvi said that Ram temple is not a political subject for us
 unhone kaha is desh main ram mandir nahin banegaa to kahaan banegaa
 In this way, Sadhvi Pragya Singh, who was sentenced to jail on the charges of bomb blasts, had earlier questioned the martyrdom of an officer and now raised the issue of Ram temple again, while speaking of pride in the demolition of Babri Masjid

 mahaj china kii tarj par manuphaccharing hub banane kii koshish karne se puri yojana kii vifaltaa lagbhag tay hai
 Actually, America had won the manufacturing hub for the world during World War II
 is dauraan america ne apni companiyon ko aise utpaadon main sarvopari banaaya jisaki maang duniya ke har kone main thi
 After this period, American companies needed to establish manufacturing in different corners of the world to increase their profits
 is kadam se jahaan america companiyon ne manuphaccharing laagat ko kam kiya or utpaadon ke global distribution kii laagat ko kam karte hue apane munaafe ko or badha liya

 The unity of the opposition is seen in RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav's 'desh Bachao, BJP Bhagao' rally at the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 lalu yadav or unke parivaar ke alaava sharad yadav, akhilesh yadav, mamata banerjee, gulam nabi aaazaad, sipiai netaa di raja, congress ke hanumant raav, diemke ke ilangoan, ensipi ke tarik anwar manch par maujuud the
 In this rally, Lalu fiercely targeted Nitish Kumar and the bjp's central government
 isamen unka saath unke parivaar ne bhi khub diya
 Wife Rabri Devi, sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav, in their speech, declared the Modi government a failure on all fronts
 haalanki rabari devi is dauraan ek role or nibhaati najar ain
 Not only did he take on Modi and Nitish from the speech, he left no stone unturned to improve his speech by speaking back and forth during Lalu's speech
 lalu ko sahi kiyabhaashan ke dauraan lalu kai baar apni line galat bolte yaa bhoolatey hue najar aae the
 However, when a wife like Rabri is with her, such a mistake is immediately rectified
 aisa hi kuch dekhne ko mila gandhi maidan ke 'desh bachaao, bijepi bhagaao' raily main
 While giving a speech at this rally, when Lalu Yadav was targeting Nitish for Meera Kumar's presidential claim and joining hands with PM Narendra Modi, he said that this is the same Nitish Kumar had drawn PM Narendra Modi's plate and changed it Narendra Modi has taken
 tab unhone kaha ki nitish purniya main baadh surveykshan ke dauraan chaandi ke thali main 52 bhoga lagaakar baithe the, lekin modi ne laat markar thukraa diya
 On this, Rabri corrected that 52 not 156 enjoyment
 tab jaakar lalu ne bhaashan sudhaarte hue kaha ki haa gujarat vaala bhi bhoj tha nitish chaandi ke thali main 156 bhoga lagaakar baithe the, lekin modi ne laat markar thukraa diya
 Rabri Devi had brought Rabri to Lalu, tell you in politics, where today Lalu Yadav, who is known for speech art, is correcting the words
 vahiin ek samay tha jab vah raajnneeti main nahin aana chaahati thim
 However, it was Lalu, who started his political career by giving confidence to Rabri Devi
 ‘chaara ghotaale’ main giraftaar tay ho jane ke baad 1997 main lalu ne mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya or apni patni rabari devi ko bihar kaa mukhyamantri bana diya tha
 It is said that Lalu Prasad Yadav does not do any work without the advice of his wife Rabri Devi
 kai baar unhen rabari devi kii jid ke aage bhi jhukna bhi padaa he
 His elder son Tejapratap's entry in Bihar politics is also due to him
 tejasvi se jalte the nitishaisse pehle raily main sambodhit karte hue lalu yadav ne kaha ki is vakt endie main jo bhi bihar se bade netaa hai wo sabhi unheen ke products hai
 Hitting out at Nitish, Lalu said that he never trusted Nitish Kumar but had made a grand alliance before the assembly elections with a heavy heart to stop the communal forces
 nitish ke is kadam ko lekar hamen pehle se hi jaankaree thi, ki ye aadmi vishwaas ke laayak nahin he
 Lalu said that Nitish Kumar was getting upset by the rising stature of Tejashwi Yadav in Bihar politics
 nitish andar-hi-andar jal rahe the, unase dekha nahin ja rahaa tha ki unke aage kaa ladkaa janata main lokapriy ho rahaa he
 Nitish Sajishan parted from the Grand Alliance to taint Tejashwi and went with the BJP

 Also, such arrangements will be made that the land of the farmers is not auctioned
 " Mulayam on Monday targeted only the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at the election rally held in Brahmanand College in favor of Ambresh Kumari, a candidate from Rath Safe seat in Hamirpur
 unhone bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) or congress kaa naam tak nahin liya
 Mulayam said, “the bridges built at Chadaut, Kuchchha and Kherapara were sanctioned during my tenure
 basapa sirf sarkari dhan se murtiyon lagavakar use vikaas kaa naam de rahi he
 "he said," If the SP government is formed, the farmers suffering from serious diseases will be treated at government expense and the loans of the farmers taken from the cooperative societies will be forgiven
 saath hi aisi vyavastha kii jaaegi ki kisaanon kii jameen nilaam na ho

 But before the school bus could get out, all the children were asked to empty the bus and go back to their class
 uske baad sabhi bas ke driveron ko skool ke bheetar bulaayaa gaya tha or unase kuch baatcheet kii gai thi
 The school bus left again after 1 hour
 aakhir skool bas ko chalane se thik pehle kyon roka gaya tha or driveron ko bulaakar kya poochtacha kii gai thi? bason ko achaanak kisne rukvaaya tha or uski vajah kya thi?2
 The police is claiming that when Pradyumajn went to the toilet, he saw Ashok, the conductor of the bus, in an objectionable condition
 police ke mutabik ashok ne pradhyumna ke saath dushkarm karne kii koshish kii or aisa nahin kar paane ke baad maamla khul jane ke dar se uski galaa retkar hatya kar di
 But there are many flaws in the police case story
 dushkarm karne kii baat ko to postmortem report ne hi khaarij kar diya
 If the police believe that the conductor Ashok was really masturbating in the toilet, then it must also be confirmed that he closed the toilet door from within
 agar vah bheetar se kundi lagaana bhul bhi gaya to bhi usne darwaja kaa pallaa band kiya hoga isamen koi shaq nahin ho saktaa
 The conductor of a bus will not do so by opening the door in the school toilet when it is time for the children to come
 police ke mutabik jab darwaja kholaa to usne ashok ko aisa karte hue dekh liya
 But the question is, why would Pradyuman have finally opened the toilet door? The school toilet within which he was killed has two parts
 baahar khule main peshaab karne ke liye urinal lage hai or unke saamne band daravaaje vaale cabin bane hai, jisamen indian seat lage hai
 At the time Pradyuman was killed he had a school bag on his shoulder
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki vah sirf peshaab karne ke liye toilet gaya tha or use poti karne vaale cabin kaa darwaja kholane kii koi jarurat nahin thi
 It cannot be assumed that if Pradyuman had not to potty urine, then why would he go to the toilet with a backpack on his back? This question is even more important because Pradyuman's class was only a few steps away from the restroom and if he wanted to, he could go to the toilet by staying in his class
 police ne paas abhi iskaa koi jawaab nahin he
 3
 police kaa kahana he ki ashok ke paas jo chaaku mila wo bas ke tulkit kaa hissaa tha
 Buses tool kits usually do not have a knife
 khaastaur par vaisaa chaaku jisase hatya kii gai
 According to sources, the sticker was also placed on the knife, which means that it was purchased recently
 ashok ne chaaku kab or kahaan se kharida iskaa pataa karne kii bhi police ne koshish nahin kii he
 4
 police kii yah daleel bhi samaj ke pare he ki ashok chaaku ko dhone ke liye toilet main lekar gaya tha
 Why did the knife need to be washed out of all the tools in the toolkit? Did he bring other tools of the toolkit to wash as well? If not, why only the knife? Even before the toilet in the school, there are two places where water taps are installed
 ek jagah par pipe bhi laga he jisase driver conductor bas dhote hai
 Why did Ashok use the toilet tap to wash the knife? The police have not investigated whether the other conductors used the children's restrooms to wash their tool kit before this? 5
 police kii kahani ke mutabik, ashok ne apane kapade par khun ke daag chupaane ke liye galaa kaatane ke baad pradhyumna ko god main uthaa liya tha taaki kisi ko uske kapadon par khun ke daag ke bare main shaq nahin ho
 During interrogation, the school teacher also said that he saw Pradyuman in Ashoka's lap
 aisi haalat main skool kii koshish yahi rahi hogi ki jaldi se jaldi use gaadi main ladakar aspataal pahunchaaya jaae
 But something happened that arouses suspicion
 pradhyumna ko uthaakar ashok skool ke resepshan tak to aayaa lekin aspataal nahin aayaa
 From the reception, a peon of the school picked him up on his lap and made him sit in the car
 ashok ko uske baad skool ne vahiin par roak liya or police ko khabar di
 If the peon could go to the hospital with Pradyumna, then why not conductor Ashok? After all, why did the school stop Ashoka with himself? 6
 jis toilet mempradyumna kii hatyahui uski khidki kaa saria is tarah se kaata gaya he ki kisi ke vahaan se nikalne kii jagah ban gai he
 The special thing is that the window bars have not deteriorated due to rust, rather the blade seems to have been cut
 toilet kii khidki kaa saria kisne or kyon kaata police ne is bare main skool ke adhikariyon se gaharaai se poochtacha karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 These questions are such that the police have not given any satisfactory answer
 kya pradhyumna kii hatya kii pehle se hi sajeesh kii gai thi or use jabardastee kisi ne skool ke toilet main khinch liya? pradhyumna ke gharavaalon ko ummid he ki sibiai kii jaanch main in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab mil jayega

 ' Congress leader Milind Deora on Tuesday expressed concern over the situation in Mumbai Congress and said that the infighting within the party has put the party's base in the metropolis at risk

 The Mumbai Congress cannot be a cricket pitch for communal politics in which leaders are pitted against each other
 In a city like Mumbai, which is our economic and cultural capital, we need to bring people together
 The Mumbai Congress cannot become a cricket pitch for sectarian politics, with leaders pitted against one other

 com / 8bbkox02ts — ANI (@ANI) February 5, 2019 Former MP Milind Deora hinted at contesting his Lok Sabha elections but also opened the door to speculation about whether he will contest
 bataa den ki pichley dinon congress kii purv saansad priya dutt ne kaha tha ki ve is baar chunaav nahin ladengi
 However, the reason behind this was that he could not sit in sync with his political and personal life
 aapako bataa den ki sanjay nirupam pehle shivasena ke netaa rahe hai or saal 2005 main unhone congress kaa daaman thama tha
 He was elected Congress MP in 2009 but despite losing the election in 2014, he was made the President of Mumbai Congress
 nirupam ko abhi bhi khantee congressi bahari samajhate hai, jinhone shivasena kii ugr samskruti main raajnneeti sikhi he
 Mumbai Congress leaders have also complained to Congress President Rahul Gandhi about the way Nirupam works
 lekin nirupam congress kii raajnneetik jarurat banate gaye
 In fact, in order to compete with the bjp-shiv Sena in Mumbai, the Congress needs a person to answer in their own language in which Nirupam fits
 vahiin mumbai congress kaa ek dhada milind devda ke saath he, jinke pita murali devda ne dashakon tak mumbai congress kaa netritv kiya he
 Congress leader Milind Deora is known for his strong opinion
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke 44 siton par simat jane par unhone congress netritv tak kii aalochana karte hue kaha tha ki haar kii jimmedaari sirf salaahkaaron kii nahin lekin unki bhi he jo salaah lete hai
 However, the differences in the Mumbai Congress just before the Lok Sabha elections can cause trouble for Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 maharashtra main maratha aarakshan ko lekar jari andolan ke bich ab rajya main muslim aarakshan kii maang uthne lagi he
 However, instead of protesting on the road, the Muslim community will peacefully meet the government and the governor and demand reservation in a legal way
 aarakshan kii maang ko aage badhaane ke liye somvaar ko muslim samaaj ke netaaon or sanghathanon ne mumbai ke islam gymkhana main baithak kii
 It was attended by Ulema Council officials, including Mumbai Congress MLA Arif Nasim Khan, Amin Patel, Aslam Sheikh, AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan, SP MLA Abu Asim Azmi
 bataa den kiarakshan ke liye sarkaar ke khilaafasadakon par utarkar pradarshan karne or mumbai sahit puure maharashtra ko band karaane kii dhamkee dene vaale muslim netaaon or sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon ne baithak main apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya he
 Now they have decided that instead of getting on the road, they will demand reservation in a legal and peaceful manner
 baithak main shaamil logon ne kaha ki musalmaan saamaajik-aarthik rup se pichde hai
 The Muslim was given 5 per cent reservation in higher education which was upheld by the court, but the government did not act on it and the ordinance was abolished
 ulema council ke mahasachiv moulana mahmud dariyaabaadi ne kaha ki ab naukariyon or shiksha main musalamaanon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 He said that Adalat had rejected the Maratha reservation, but maintained the Muslim reservation on the basis that the community was financially backward
 aise main musalamaanon ko aarakshan diya janaa chahie
 Congress leader Nasim Khan is enraged in the Muslim community that the government is not approving our demands
 ham nahin chaahate hai ki maahaul kaa dhruvikaran ho
 That is why we will follow legal means to get reservation
 unhone kaha ki ab pratinidhimandal ke jariye mukhyamantri se milenge or unase jald se jald muslimon ko aarakshan lagu karne kii baat karenge
 Apart from this, it has also been decided to set up two types of committees under the leadership of lawyers to fight the demand for reservation in a legal way
 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar sapa or basapa philhal ke liye saath aa gaye hai
 More than the discussions going on regarding the SP-BSP alliance, it is being speculated on who will go from BSP to Rajya Sabha
 BSP supremo Mayawati herself or her brother Anand Kumar will be the BSP candidate for the Rajya Sabha
 anand kumaar mayawati ke uttaradhikari?bataa den ki kuch maheene pehle mayawati ne apane bhai anand kumaar ko party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh banaaya tha
 Since then, she is constantly pushing Anand Kumar as the second face of the party
 aise main manaa ja rahaa he ki anand kumaar ko wo rajyasabha bhej sakati hai
 In the Rajya Sabha elections, SP will give its additional vote to the BSP candidate
 mayawati ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik rajyasabha ke liye vah apane bhai anand kumaar ko pratyaashee bana sakati hanspa kamayawatiko ofrasutra bataate hai ki sapa ne mayawati ke khud chunaav ladane kii sthiti main apni seat dene kaa ofer kiya tha
 On the other hand, it is being said that Mayawati wants to send her brother Anand Kumar to Rajya Sabha instead of herself
 is bahaane ke gathbandhan ko parakhnaa rahi hai ki sapa ke vot bispi ke liye transfar ho rahe hai yaa nahin
 The BSP needs support, according to the political arithmetic of the Rajya Sabha elections, the SP has 10 additional votes, while the BSP has 19 and the Congress has only 7 votes
 iske alaava 1 vot areldi, 1 nishad party or teen nirdaleey vot bhi shaamil hai
 All these votes are required to win the BSP
 rajyasabha kii ek seat ke liye kam se kam 37 maton kii darkaar hoti he
 Mayawati's deal with Congress The importance of how the math of votes in Rajya Sabha is important for BSP can be gauged from the press release of Mayawati in which she talked to Congress about 'one hand lo-one hand two' deal
 mayawati ne kaha tha ki congress ko agar madhyapradesh se rajyasabha chunaav main bispi kaa samarthan chahie to use uttar pradesh main bispi ke ummidavaar ko samarthan karnaa hoga
 Explain that while bringing her brother Anand Kumar into active politics, Mayawati said that her focus is Uttar Pradesh
 jabaki unke bhai anand dilli main party kaa kaamkaaj dekhenge

 Nepali Ambassador to India Deep Kumar Upadhyay said that Hindu sentiments have been taken care of in the Constitution

 yah 2010 kii baat he
 Kalyan near Mumbai, was a student of the fifth semester of Diploma in Civil Engineering at Father Agnel's Polytechnic College, Vashi in Navi Mumbai
 unheen garmiyon main usne navi mumbai main ek building project main train civil ejeeniyar ke taur par internship kii
 Then in 2012 during the eighth semester she did an internship in a housing project on Grant Road, South Mumbai
 usee saal baad main, 77 fisadi ankon ke saath apana course paas kar lene par usne panwel main e
 R
 kalsekar degree college main daakhila le liya
 In this way, it can be a common story or resume of youth of a suburb of Mumbai - alike, seeking to get out of middle-class growth
 lekin aisa he nahin
 Now 23-year-old Areeb told the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Mumbai during interrogation, "I left degree college in May 2014 and left for Iraq
 ’’ phir 24 may ko mumbai se desh chhodie or 28 november ko desh lautne or natijatan giraftaar ke bich arib iraq, syria tathaa turki main jaakar islamic state of iraq and syria (iageies) ke jehadi ke taur par ladata rahaa, goliyaan khain, mara bhi ghoshit kar diya gaya, hawaii bambaari main bachaa, do fidain hamalon se bhi salaamat rahaa or phir use laga ki jehadi ke taur par usne bahut ji liya
 This is the story of Indian jihadi
 yah kahani usne enie main poochtacha karne waalon ko batalaai-jo appindia tudeke haath lagi he
 The religious initiation was born in his ancestral house in Ansari Chowk, a Muslim-dominated middle-class area of welfare
 phir 2007 main vah kalyaan (pashchim) ke thode behatar sarvoday residency main pahunch gaya
 His Greek doctor father Ejaz Majid wanted to give a better life to his children
 arib ne 2008 main lords hyskool se 83 fisadi ankon ke saath dasvin paas kii
 His inclination towards religion was in his teens - when he was studying in VIII in 2005, he came into contact with a man named Mishaal Bhai in a local mosque to head the welfare unit of the Students Islamic Organization (SIO)
 Used to claim arib pehali baar may, 2005 main esaio ke daftar gaya or jaldi hi uskaa sadsy ban gaya
 The following month, SIO organized a two-day trip to Matheran, a small hill station near Mumbai
 trip ke baad arib kaaphi dharmik ban gaya
 Investigators say it played a key role in his initial interest in Islam
 arib kaa kahana he ki mumbai ke islamic research foundation ke adhyaksh or antarrashtriya rasookh vaale vyaakhyaata dow
 After listening to the lectures of Zakir Naik, he would be interested to read more about Islam
 lagbhag yahi vah samay tha jab uske bheetar ke udaar musalmaan kii jagah panpate kattar musalmaan ne le lee
 After he started going to college in January 2013, reports of ISIS establishing a Khilafat in Iraq and Syria started coming in
 jald hi uskaa fasebuk acount is saamagree se at gaya
 Areeb said, "I also got contacts from profiles associated with those Facebook pages
 lekin unamem se koi meri madad nahin kar rahaa tha
 i did Australia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, America
 
 
 ke kai logon se baat karne kii koshish kii lekin ve saare log bas itnaa hi kehete the ki pehle turki pahunch jaao
 "he was also deeply read along with watching online videos about ISIS and Jihad
" asaliyat main nirnaayak rup se arib ko syria kii ore le jane vaala haddees kaa sabak tha, jisamen jab ek sahabi (saathi) ne paigambar se poocha ki hizrat (migration) ke liye kahaan janaa chahie to use jawaab mila, ‘‘syria jaao
 "there was a difficulty - neither he could go alone nor without any solid contact
" jamaat or yojanajab arib ke jehan main iageies main shaamil hone kaa khyaal tairne laga to use apane dost fahd shaikh kii yaad ai, jisase kuch maheene pehle vah ilaake kii masjid main mila tha
 The two soon became close friends - both online and in reality
 fahd ne dakshin mumbai main nagpada college se maikenical ejineering kii padhai kii thi
 Areeb said that Fahd had deep knowledge of Islam
 farvari, 2014 main arib ne fahd se apni yojanaon kaa khulaasa kiya
 Fahd said that two of his other friends - Saheem Tankhi and Aman Tandil, also want to join ISIS
 ek paanchaven shaks ne bhi shuru main dilchaspee dikhaani shuru kii thi lekin kathith taur par baad main vah peeche hat gaya
 Areeb, who has been searching for the route to Syria since 2013, knew that the easiest way was to go through Turkey
 syria kii seemaa se lage deshon ke vija kii talash main march, 2014 main vah travel oparator thomas cook ke kalyaan daftar pahunchaa
 He came to know that Turkey's entire 11-day package was Rs 80,000 per person
 kaa tha-khaasaa mahangaa
 Then the next problem was also about the documents that were required for the visa - six months bank statement, salary slip and passport
 saare kaagaj safar se ek maheene pehle jamaa karaane jaruri the
 So Turkey got out of the plan
 ve log plan bi par kaam karne lage
 "I found the easiest way on the Internet to go to Iraq and Syria from there," said Areeb
 ’’ is bich use yah bhi pataa chalaa ki koi bhi jiyaarat vija par iraq ja saktaa he, jiske liye kisi dastavej kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Areeb came to know of a travel operator named Rahat Tours who collected all the expenses for him at Rs 60,000 per person
 kaa ritern package uplabdh kara rahaa tha
 He paid the money in installments
 rasta banataa dikhaa to arib ne tahiraa bhatta naam kii philstini mahila se sampark saadhaa jisase soshal netwarking cites ke jariye uskaa parichay tha
 Areeb asks her about any contact in Baghdad for help
 lekin zyaadaatar log khud ko jaahir nahin karnaa chaahate the, isliye ravaanaa hone se mahaj 10 din pehle unhen mosul main ek abu fatima kaa sampark mil paaya
 The nia's interrogation of Areeb has also rejected Airab's speculation about Tahira from his marriage
 arib ne kaha, ‘‘’(iageies ke saath) meri training khatm hone par maine phone par tahiraa se baat kii or hamane nikaah karne kaa faisla kiya
 a few days later i decided to go on a fidayeen mission in Iraq
 usne bhi philstin main aisa hi karne kaa rasta chunaa
 We knew we were about to die, but before going to Palestine he updated his Facebook profile and wrote that he had been married to Majid
 iskaa makasad zyada se zyada bharatiyon ko ‘‘friend request’’ bhejne ke liye lubhaana tha taaki jawaab main vah unhen syria aane main madad de sake
 "but our marriage was never done
" ’’baghdad or mosulamai kii 24 taarikh ko arib savere saadhe gyaarah baje ghar se niklaa
 She collected Rs 33,000 from her mother's drawer
 nikaale or unhen western union mani transfar kii shakha se 538 dollar main badalawaaya
 He reached Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at around 12
45 pm and the four of them flew Etihad Airways flight number EY-205 at 4 am
 arib ne agali subah abu dhabi hawaii adde se apane abba ko phone par khabar di ki vah hizaarat ke liye syria ja rahaa he
 Her father made every effort to persuade her to return, but he did not
 25 may ko dopaher main ve baghdad pahunch gaye
 In the next few days in Baghdad, he called two contacts - Rahman Daulati, a contact of Saheem, and Abu Fatima, suggested by Tahira several times and each time he received the same answer - be patient
 tab un chaaron ne iraq ke duusare sabase bade shahar mosul jane kaa faisla kiya
 His first day in Mosul was wasted on 1 June
 uske baad unke paas fatima se sandeshaa ayah dopaher kii namaaj ke baad sabunji masjid main intjaar karen
 During the wait, the army men caught him as they all had bags and apparently seemed to be coming from outside
 ve unhen poochtacha ke liye nikat hi mukhyalay main le gaye
 He was released two hours later
 ‘‘jaise hi ham baahar aae, abu fatima ne mujhase sampark kiya or hamen phir se masjid ke get ke paas lautakar intjaar karne ko kaha
 Soon two people arrived there in a white Hyundai car
 jis driver ne hamen car main baithne ko kaha, usne apana naam ali bataaya tha
 After a twenty-minute drive, they reached Ali's house on the outskirts of Mosul
 arib ne bataaya ki teen bacchon kaa pita ali aaleeshaan duplex ghar main rahata he
 "he searched our bags, removed the SIM cards from our phones and took all the phones except my Samsung Note-1
 ’’ arib ko google translator ke istemaal ke liye bina sim card ke phone rakhane kii ijaajat di gai kyonki vahaan kam hi log angreji jaanate the
 They stayed at Ali's house for two days, during which he tested their information about Islam
 ‘‘usne hamen tajakiya ke bare main poocha yani iesaiel (iageies) main shaamil hone ke liye kisi maujuuda iesaiel sadsy se anivaary sifarish hoti he
 We had no Tajikia, Ali took us to Abu Yusuf's house in the neighborhood
 ’’ve chaar or din yani 6 june tak usuf ke ghar main ruke, or kisi sifarish ke liye unki sari darkhwaasten khaarij ho gayi
 On one occasion, Ali advised him to return to India
 arib ne bataaya ki aakhri raste ke taur par ali ne chechan ladaake or iraq tathaa syria ke military commander umr shishani se baat kii
 At the behest of the Training Officer, the four were sent to a place named Jazeera for training
 vah chota-sa gaanv tha jisamen 10-12 ghar the
 The population there was 25–30
 ‘‘ve sabhi iageies ke ladaake the; vah ek camp sareekha tha
 All the fighters in that village were from Iraq, except a media representative from Britain
 ’’lagbhag 10-12 din kii training ke baad, jis dauraan iageies ne mosul or iraq-syria seemaa ko kabje main kar liya tha, un chaaron ko uttari syria main ek shahar rakka bhej diya gaya
 In Raqqa, ISIS converted a school into a registration center for foreign members of the group
 arib ke anusaar, uskaa naam hudood centre tha
 After a day's stay there, about 200 new members were sent to different places in buses for further training on 19 June
 chaaron bhartiya 60 logon ke us group main shaamil the jinhen najdiki camp le jaaya gaya jise sarai mbskar kaha jaataa tha
 There were about 300 ISIS members from different countries
 mbskar main do hafte tak unhen hathiyaar chalaane kii training di gai
 Then another training camp took place at Moaskar Falluja where they were given physical and weapons training
 kul 15 din kaa yah camp 16 july ko khatm hua, jiske baad teesraa charan abdulla ajjam mbskar main kiya gaya
 Here these recruits were taught about making landmines (ubwa) from the fertilizer, military tactics and face-to-face fighting
 opareshantraining ke baad teenon ejiniyaron-fahd, amaan or arib ko baaki ejiniyaron, doctoron or programmeron ke saath rakhaa gaya
 He was allowed to carry AK-47 rifles given during training and in addition 30-30 rounds were given
 sahim ko guard ke rup main kaam karne ke liye syria-iraq seemaa par rabia shahar main bhej diya gaya
 But Areeb did not involve himself in ISIS for this
 ‘‘maine fidaayin hamale par jane kaa faisla kiya
 On 3 August i went to Iraq in a minibus
 ’’haalanki aatmghaatee hamalaa ho nahin paaya
 That same late night, Areeb suffered a leg injury in US air strikes on the city of Baz in Iraq
 vah 4 agast ko mosul pahunchaa or das din ke aaraam ke baad apane pehle fidain hamale ke liye taiyaar tha
 After eight more days have passed, the emir (chief) of the Fidayeen squad, Nizar, told Areeb that the turn of his attack had arrived
 unki yojana mosul baandh par kabja karne kii thi or arib ko ek aatmghaatee inasaani bam yani ‘‘isteshaadi’’ bananaa tha
 His plan was that the Kurdish guards guarding the dam would be beaten up by a civilian van loaded with two and a half tons of explosives, defying them
 lekin yah is baar bhi nahin hona tha
 Areeb said, "two days before the attack, the car became the victim of an airstrike
" ’’arib kaa daawa he ki agle din vah igimasi ke rup main training lene ke liye uttar-pashchim iraq ke tal afra shahar main chalaa gaya
 Igimasi means to take all the weapons and ammunition that a human can carry, to go into battle and to martyr himself when the weapons are finished
 ‘‘teen din ke baad main or 11 anya igimasi (ladaake) mosul baandh kii ladaai ke liye laut pade
 "each of us has an AK-47, Dragunov (sniper rifle), PKC machine gun, RPG, 1,000 rounds of PKC, 300 rounds of AK-47, four hand grenades, Glock 19 (pistol)," said Areeb
 ,
 9 mem ke 50 kaartoos or ek chaaku diya gaya
 "areeb was shot in this fight and remained unconscious in the hospital for eight days
" haalat thik hone ke baad usne phir se khud ko fidain hamale ke liye pesh karne kaa faisla kiya
 This time in Jammar near Kurdistan
 lekin 20 din tak dushman ne us ilaake par hamalaa kiya hi nahin
 Areeb then returned to Raqqa
 bharat vaapasi21 aktubar ko arib ne apane parivaar se sampark saadhaa
 They had already agreed that he had been killed in the fighting in Syria
 is dauraan uski bahan rushna kaa bhi nikaah ho chukaa tha
 "I realized that my father-in-law Ammi was right - what i wanted was achieved
" main santusht tha; main jo bhi kar saktaa tha, maine kiya or ab main lautnaa chahta tha
 "on November 21, Areeb sought leave from his commander on the basis of medical and family problems
 jawaab mila, ‘‘agar tum bharat lautate ho, to tumhaari ekmaatr jagah jail hogi
 "but Arib remained adamant
 tab arib ko ek sef house jane kii ijaajat mil gai, jahaan alag-alag deshon ke 15 or log ghar vaapasi kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 From there they were first taken to Zarabulus in Syria and then across the border to Gaziantep in Turkey

 rishi kapur ek gambhir beemaari se jujhane ke baad bharat waapas laut aae hai
 He is also known for his brilliant acting as well as his outspoken statements
 unhone haal hi main artists ke saath hote bartaav par apni raay rakhi he
 Rishi Kapoor said in a conversation with IANS, 'I am very upset with the way the government of our country treats the artists of the country
 bharat ek aisa desh he jo duniya bhar main apane mujeec, culture or cinema ke liye pahachaanaa jaataa he lekin hamaare desh ke artists ke saath doum darje kaa bartaav kiya jaataa he
 Most of the new roads, flyovers, built in the country are named after India's politicians at airports
 aakhir kyon in public places ke naam artists ke naam par nahin rakhe jate hai?'unhone kaha, 'hamaare desh main pandit ravi shankar, ustad allaa rakkha khan, lata mangeshkar ji jaise shandaar kalakaar hai
 There have been artists like Raj Kapoor, Prithviraj Kapoor, i am not saying this because i belong to the family of Raj Kapoor but can the contribution of these stars in cinema be forgotten? The contributions of these people are celebrated all over the world but this is not the case in our own country
 aakhir kyon?'view this post on instagrama post shared by Rishi Kapoor (@rishikapoorofficial)onjun 7, 2014 at 12:47am pdt'duniya bhar main hota he kalakaaron kaa sammaan, bharat main kyon nahin ?'unhone kaha ki 'america main elvis presli, maaikel jackson jaise kai artists hai jinke naam par kai public places hai or america kii yang janareshan in sitaron ke bare main jaanati bhi he lekin hamaare desh main sabhi chizon ke naam rajaneta ke naamon par rakh die jate hai
 There are also women like Astronaut Kalpana Chawla in our country who have brought laurels to the name of India around the world and they are an inspiration to many but the politicians of the country keep the public place under their agenda just after the leaders
 jab tak ham in logon ko lokapriy nahin banaaenge or public place jaise airport, road, skool, college jaisi jagahon ke naam in prerak sitaron ke naamon par nahin honge tab tak aane vaali pidiyon ko in hastiyon ke yogadan ke bare main kaise pataa chalegaa?'

 Scindia said on the occasion of the 72-hour Satyagraha of the Congress, which started at four o'clock on Wednesday evening at Dussehra ground in TT Nagar, Scindia said that Mandsaur incident is a stigma for the country
 iske liye koi or nahin, balki rajya sarkaar or mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan jimmedaar hai
 Scindia quipped when the indefinite fast by the Chief Minister for peace restoration in the state ended within 28 hours and said that it was not a fast but a mockery of farmers because the Chief Minister broke the fast by drinking water in a silver glass
 congressi saansad ne rajya or centre sarkaar ko kisaan virdohi qaraar dete hue kaha ki desh main in sarkaron ke chalate kisaan aatmahatyaayein bad gai hai

 mukhyamantri dwaara rajya main shanti bahaali ke liye kiye gaye anischitkaaleen upwas ke 28 ghante main hi khatm hone par sindhiya ne chutki lee or kaha ki yah upwas nahin, balki kisaanon kaa uphaas tha kyonki, mukhyamantri ne chaandi ke gilaas main pani pikar upwas todaa
 Describing the state and central government as anti-farmer, the Congress MP said that farmer suicides have increased due to these governments in the country

 Goa minister Sudin Dhavalikar, who was caught in a controversy by protesting the small clothes in the pub, has now given a new statement about the bikini
 sudin ne mangalvaar ko sarkaar se maang kii ki vah goa ke samudr tat par bikini pahanane par pratibandh lagaae
 The minister argues that this increases the incidence of molestation
 peedblyoody mantri dhavalikar ne kaha, 'hamen aise logon (bikini girls) ko saarvajanik jagahon par aane kii ijaajat nahin deni chahie, kyonki isse goa main alag-alag rajyon se aae logon par kaabo paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 'the special thing is that Dhavalikar's statement came just after the meeting with Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar
 dhavalikar ne kaha ki unke vichaaron ke bare main mukhyamantri ko acchhee tarah se jaankaree he
 CM is already busy taking action against massage parlors and he will work at many levels to ban this useless thing
 tairne ke liye bikini kii jarurat kahaan?bikini par pabandi ko lekar sudin dhavalikar ne tark diya ki samudr main tairne ke liye bikini kii koi anivaaryta nahin he
 Sudin said, 'where is the need for a bikini on the beach? In earlier times, there was no bikini
 mujhe yaad he ki 90 ke dashak main bhi samudr tat par log bikini nahin pahante the
 'however, the Chief Minister could not be available for any comment on this entire matter
 lekin bijepi ne mantriji ke bayaan kii ninda kii he or kaha ki aisa karne se goa main paryaton par asar padegaa
 Party Spokesperson Wilfred Mesquita said that Goa is a part of the country and no difference will be made with it
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko dhavalikar ne shriram sena ke pramukh pramod muthalik ke bayaan par sahmati jataate hue pub main chote kapadon ko lekar tippanee kii thi
 The PWD minister had said, 'girls going to pubs wearing short dresses shows the wrong culture
 pub main ladakiyon kaa chote kapade pahananaa hamaari samskruti main feet nahin baithta he
 If we allow this, what will happen to our Goa culture? ”last month, Muthalik announced that he would launch an outfit in Goa that would go against pubs, drugs and sex culture
 or virodh main bhej diya pink skirtsudin dhavalikar ke chote kapadon sambandhi bayaan ke baad congress ne unhen courier ke jariye ek pink skirt bhent kii he

 ' pakistan cricket team ke purv captain shahid aafridi or purv bhartiya cricket gautam gambhir ke jubaani jang jari he
 Afridi has now retaliated on Gambhir's treatment statement
 unhone kaha ki gambhir ko dimagi samasya he or yadi vah chahta he to main apane aspataal main uskaa ilaaj karaungaa
 Afridi said that if he has a problem with the visa, then i will also arrange for him to get a visa soon
 aafridi ne ye baaten apni aatmakatha 'game changer' ke vimochan ke maukey par kahi
 Please tell that Afridi has written negative things about Gambhir in his book
 afridi ne apni aatmakatha main vyangyatmak rup main gambhir ke bare main likhaa ki vah is tarah kaa vyavhaar karte hai jaise vah don breadman or james band donon kii kaabiliyat rakhane vaala he or uskaa ravaiya bhi acha nahin he or na hi uske koi mahaan ricard hai
 In response, Gambhir offered to take the former Pakistan captain to a 'psychiatrist'
 or ab aafridi ne gambhir kii baton kaa jawaab diya he
 There is not a good synergy between these two players inside and outside the field, which is clearly reflected in such a comment by Afridi
 donon kii dushmani kii shuruyaat 2007 main hui
 In 2007, there was an argument between the two in a bilateral ODI series in Kanpur

 Seeing Ravindranath being photographed from her mobile phone, the woman called the High Grounds Police
 gauda ke mutabik apni shikaayat main mahila ne aarope lagaaya ki ravindranath ne apane mobile camere se aapattijanak tasviren utaari
 However, IPS said that nothing of the sort had happened
 ravindranath ne patrakaron se kaha, ek shaks ne meraa phone chin liya or aarope lagaaya ki mai coffee shop main ladakiyon kii tasviren utaar rahaa hum
 But i did nothing
 'haalanki, gauda ne kaha ki agar jarurat padi to aaropee ko giraftaar kiya jayega

 But on September 17, it was told that Harish has dengue and died the next day

 Pitch Curate Samundar Singh Chauhan Whenever he works on the pitch of a field, some kind of Ihtas is formed on it
 indore ke holkar stadium main bhi guuruuvaar ko yahi hua
 Explosive batsman Virender Sehwag, batting in his own style, scored the highest individual score in ODI history
 sahvaag ne apni aatishi pari ke dauraan na sirf 219 ran banaakar itihaas rach daalaa balki ekadivasiy maichon main bharat kaa sarvocch score khadaa karne main bhi ahm bhoomika nibhaai

 Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Mohammad Azharuddin and Yuvraj Singh have touched the figure before him
 itnaa hi nahin is match main bharat ne 418 ran banaae jo apane aap main ricard he
 The funny thing is that the pitch curator of the Sachin Tendulkar scored a double century in the one-day match in February 2010 with South Africa at the Rup Singh Stadium in Gwalior
 is tarah samundar ke dwaara taiyaar kii gai pich tendulkar va sahvaag ke liye itihaas rachane main madadgaar sabit hui
 Before the match, the pitch curator Samundar had also expressed the possibility of a big score and so did it
 samundar ke khate main ek or itihaas bhi darj he
 The pitch on which Sachin Tendulkar scored 10,000 runs was also made by him
 austrailia ke khilaaf khele gaye is match main sachin ne 139 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 He needed 34 runs to become ten Hazari and did this feat in the same ground in Sachin
 gwalior ke cricket khilaadi va samundar ke sahyogi sanjeev agarwal kehete hai ki samundar singh ne sabit kar diya he ki ve match ke anurup sakasham pich bana sakate hai
 The demand for a one-day match is such that if it is thrilling, many fours and sixes are also seen

 Rajiv said, "give one more year
 dekhiegaa jo log tivi par hai unhen koi nahin pahachaanegaa or jo web par hai unhen sabhi pahachaanenge
 The reason is that the TV audience is constantly shrinking and the web is constantly growing
 jitna meraa cirkil he unamem se 90 pratishat web dekhte hai
 "rajiv said that to know how big the world of the web is, if i ask a simple question, i would say that the audience of the series like Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad is more than all the big movies
 yahi bhavishya he
 Sharing an anecdote related to his personal life, Rajiv said that once he found an elderly fan who did not talk about his old films but mentioned his web series
 jab rajeev ko mila unka web siries fainerajeev ne jab unki filmon ke bare main poocha to unhone kaha ki betaa unka mujhe nahin pataa main to cold lassi dekhtaa hum

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter aaj ke samay main asthma se peedit bacchon kii sakhyaan kam nahin he
 The main reason for this is the poor routine of children and increasing pollution in the environment
 chote-chote bachche kam aayu main hi is rog kii chapet main aa rahe hai
 Which is quite worrying
 kaha jaataa he ki badalte mausam main asthma ke marijon ko khud par zyada dhyaan dene kii jarurat hoti he
 According to a new study, if asthma patients keep the amount of vitamin d in their diet, then they can easily take care of themselves even in the changing season without any problem
 jarnal of allergy and clinical immunology main prakashit ek nai study ke mutabik, diet main kam vitamin di hone se asthma se peedit bacchon kii samasya kaaphi bad sakati he
 According to the study, the smoke of cigarettes and candles on the health of children who are deficient in vitamin d has more negative effects than other children
 bataa den, study main 120 asthma se peedit schuli chaatro ko shaamil kiya gaya
 This study paid special attention to 3 things - the level of air pollution in the home, the amount of vitamin d in the blood, and the symptoms of asthma
 vaise yahaan par yah jaananaa bhi jaruri he ki 120 main se kai bachche motaape kaa bhi shikaar the
 The results that came out in this study showed that if there is more air pollution in your house but there is a good amount of vitamin d in the body of a child with asthma, then he will not have much trouble in adjusting to this environment
 vahiin agar motaape ke shikaar bacchon ko vitamin di kii uchit maatra di jaae ,to unke andar to or vyapak parivartan dikhne ko milegaa
 The study also emphasizes that children suffering from asthma will get vitamin d due to sitting in the sun for too long, but it can have a bad effect on their skin
 study main bataaya gaya ki dhoop se vitamin di lene kii jagah agar bachche ko machhlee, mashroom, orange zeus kaa seven karavaaenge to unki body main vitamin di kii kami ko bina kisi said effect ke puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the study's lead researcher Sonali Bose says, "asthma is a disease that no permanent cure is possible
 lekin kai sari study se yah pataa chalaa he ki vitamin di se saans sambadhi bimariyon ko thik to nahin lekin us par kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 'if your child also has asthma, increase the amount of vitamin d in his diet, positive changes will start to be seen in a short time
 rajanetaaon kii pariksha puri ho gai or nattejey bhi saamne aa gaye
 Whatever happened near or failed has come to the fore but there is still no relief for the children
 unki board pariksha abhi bhi baaki he
 So we thought why not laugh a little in the midst of such tension
 pariksha se jude kuch aise hi dilachasp or mazedaar twit philhal soshal media par trend rah rahe hai

Me: bhai, steps ke marks to milenge na? big bos ke ghar kaa har sadsy jaanata he ki ghar ke niyam-kaayadon ko maananaa kitna jaruri he
 But despite all this, there are many occasions when members of the house keep these rules on hold
 big bos samay-samay par chetavanee bhi dete rahete hai
 But seeing the warning does not work, Bigg Boss has decided to take strict steps
 niyam todane ke maddenjar big bos 24 ghante ke liye rasoi ko band rakhane kaa faisla lete hai
 Bigg Boss forbade members of the house to speak in English
 aam taur par niyam todane waalon main tanisha or armaan, gauhar or kushal shaamil hai
 These people continue to speak English even after lighting the light and many times their mikes have also been landed
 ghar ke sadsy aapas main nomination prakriya par bhi baat kar rahe the, jo galat he
 This is the reason Big Boss closed the kitchen of the house for 24 hours
 videsh jane kii lalak
 Want to earn money by staying there
 amuman ye sapana bharat kaa har noujvaan dekhtaa he
 But realizing it is not a matter of everyone
 videsh jaakar kaam karne kii prakriya itani kathin he ki uski aupchaarkita puri kar paane main hi log hathiyaar daal dete hai
 Despite this, thousands of people of India go to work abroad with a dream of a golden future
 europe or america main kaam ke liye vija paanaa tedi kheer he
 But in the Gulf countries, people from South Asian countries find it easy to get work
 yahi vajah he ki bharat se hajaaron kii sankhya main log kaam karne ke liye khadi deshon kaa rukh karte hai
 But trouble occurs when they are caught in violation of any Islamic law
 ab sawaal he ki aakhir bhartiya naagarik vahaan kyon zyada pakade jate hai? isaki kai vajah hai
 One is strict Islamic law and the other is to work or live there illegally
 aamtaur par vahaan jane vaale bharatiyon ko sharia ke bare main jaankaree nahin hoti
 And they knowingly and unknowingly sit in violation of the law made on its basis
 khadi deshon main kanoon kii maar jhelane vaale in bharatiyon main aise log bhi shaamil rahete hai jo vahaan pehle se kaam karne vaale apane rishtedaaron yaa jaan-pahchaan waalon ke kehane par chale jate hai
 Being illiterate or less educated becomes a problem for them
 chunki vahaan par sin board angreji or arabi main likhe hote hai, jise wo samaj nahin pate or choti-choti galatiyon par bhi pakade jate hai
 On the other hand, there are also no less cases where Indians go there on tourist visas and start working in any place illegally
 pakade jate hai or jail main daal die jate hai
 In both such cases, there are two types of challenge before the Indian embassies
 jo log anjaane main aparaadh kar baithe hai, uske liye to vahaan kii sarkaron se guhaar lagaai jaati he, lekin jo gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se vahaan kaam kar rahe hote hai unke maamle pechida ho jate hai
 According to a report of the Ministry of External Affairs, 27% of the 29 million overseas Indians living outside India are working in the Gulf countries

 The largest number of Indians in jails in 68 countries of the world are also in the Gulf countries
 videshi jelon main band kul bharatiyon main se 45 fisadi khadi deshon main hai
 Indian citizens are locked up in eight Gulf countries on charges of violation of Islamic law, theft, fraud and unlawfully working or staying there illegally
 saudi arab main 1,469 or sanyukt arab emirate main 822 bhartiya jelon main hai
 While 2,906 Indian nationals are being sentenced in jails in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Yemen

 aapane apane ghar baithkar atali ke skin ke color ko twit karne ke alaava kya hasil kiya
 Y'all making fun of Atlee's skin color well at least he got to sit beside SRK by his own hardwork
 What have you achieved other than sitting at your home commenting about his skin colour? # Atlee # cskvkkrvahim ek yujar ne likhaa ki main aaj khud ko andhere main mahasoos kar rahi hum
 Atlee feels bad for trolling due to her skin color
 priya (atali kii patni) aaj garv mahasoos kar rahi hogi ki aaj unka pati pragati ke us shikhar par pahunch chukaa he ki use shahrukh (shahrukh Khan) ke bagal main baithne kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 Myself being mostly dark, i feel bad for the trolls that # Atlee has to go through when he makes public appearances
 # Priya should be proud that her hubby has reached a height that to sit besides # SRK is no less feat

 Uddhav, who was adamant for the cm's chair this time, was in 2014 to lose the status of 'bada Bhai'
 In 2006, a new history will be written in the politics of Maharashtra on the date of November 28, separated from Raj Thackeray
 mumbai ke shivaji park main jab uddhav bal thakare maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge to bala sahib thakare kaa saalon purana sapana hakeekat main badal jayega
 With this, the first person of the Thackeray family will take over the power of Maharashtra
 haalanki is sapane ke puure hone se pehle dosti ke kai usul toote
 a wall stood between the two brothers
 bala sahib ke saamne ek aisa vakt aayaa jab unhen apane bete or bhattije ke bich main se kisi ek chunanaa tha
 Uddhav Thackeray went through the obstacles faced by him and now after a short span of time he will be the CM of Maharashtra
 raaj-uddhav kii jodijab maharashtra main bala sahib kii tuuti bolti thi
 Uddhav and Raj were his two warlords during that time
 uddhav or raaj chachere bhai the
 Uddhav was drawn from politics, his photography seemed to mind, but Raj Thackeray was overbearing and outspoken
 logon ko unamem chachaa bal thakare kii chhavi najar aati thi
 Raj Thackeray was fast becoming popular among Shiv Sainiks
 saal 2002 main biemasi ke chunaavon main shivasena ko kamyaabi mili to bala sahib thakare ne uddhav ko 2003 main shivasena kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh bana diya
 At the same time, tickets of people recommended by Raj Thackeray were cut in this election
 2004 main uddhav ko baqayada shivasena kaa adhyaksh ghoshit kiya gaya
 However, he formally took over the presidency of Shivesana in 2013
 padhein: fadanvis ke istife par patni kaa twit- palat ke aauungi
 
 
 Letting the weather change a bit, Raj Thackeray's heartache was increasing
 aakhirkaar 2006 main wo vakt aa hi gaya, jab raaj thakare matoshri se alag ho gaye
 He formed a separate party called Maharashtra Navnirman Sena
 haalanki uddhav kehete hai ki unhone kabhi raaj thakare ko matoshri chhodkar jane ko nahin kaha tha
 After winning the Mumbai BMC election in February 2012, Uddhav said, "I go to him sometime
" 
 
 aisa nahin kaha
 
 
 He himself has gone by himself
 
 
 isliye lautne kaa sawaal mujhe nahin unase poocha janaa chahie
 "the two friends who have gone away come once again in 2019
 24 oktober ko jab maharashtra chunaav ke nattejey aae to uddhav thakare ko isamen ek ummid najar ai
 Uddhav felt that there could not be a better opportunity for Thackeray Raj's debut in Maharashtra
 uddhav thakare ne bala sahib ko die vachan kaa hawala bijepi ko diya or unke saamne 50-50 formule kii shart rakh di
 All this was unexpected for the BJP
 shivasena pichley paanch saal main kai baar baagi tevar akhriyaar kar chuki thi, lekin har baar kuch minnaton, kuch samjhauton ke baad waapas aa jaati thi
 But this time it was Uddhav that he was not having trouble
 unki ek hi shart thi siem pad
 In 2014, the BJP took the role of the elder brother Uddhav Thackeray for the last five years, in the 2014 assembly elections, the BJP took away the legacy of Balasaheb Thackeray from him
 maharashtra kii siyasat kaa jo remote control matoshri main rahata tha wo ab bijepi ke control main chalaa gaya tha
 In the 2014 elections, Shiv Sena contested on its own under Uddhav's leadership but his party could win only 63 seats
 jabaki bijepi ko 122 siten milin or shivasena ke haath se satta kii chaabi nikal gai
 The 30-year-old friendship broke down, but the results this time were such that Shiv Sena's support for the BJP was inevitable
 bas uddhav ne khule aam apni mahatvakanksha jaahir kar di
 Uddhav's ambition turned into a political enmity between BJP and Shiv Sena
 sawaal 30 saal kii dosti kaa tha
 Had to go beyond ideology
 lekin uddhav jid par ade rahe
 He accepted to walk opposite the stream, but this time he wanted the throne under any circumstances
 aakhir kuch chatak or kuch marod ke saath bijepi-shivasena kii saalon puraani dosti tut gai
 Uddhav Thackeray is going to become CM on 28 November
 laal kile ke pracheer se deshavaasiyon ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki desh aaj nai oonchaiyon ko paar kar rahaa he
 Today the whole world is looking at India with hope

 He used the word Dalit 1 time and backward twice in his speech
 piem ne yuva shabd kaa istemaal 9 baar or kisaan shabd kaa istemaal 14 baar kiya
 The entire speech of PM Modi from the ramparts of the Red Fort is heard here, that in the last four years, not even the word Dalit or backward was mentioned in PM Modi's Independence Day speech

 At the same time, Saline had accused Sunny and her husband of living in their house for spreading filth in the house
 input:ians Private hospitals have kept distance from the Ayushman scheme, the main reason for this is the expenses incurred for any disease under it
 aspataalon kaa kahana tha kisi beemaari ke liye tay kiya gaya tarriff rate vaazib nahin he or isliye ve is yojana main tahat kisi marij kaa ilaaj karne main asamarth hai
 The government is soon going to increase the expenses of about 200 diseases under Ayushman scheme, this increase will be up to 10%
 ayushmaan yojana ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari indu bhushan ke mutabik ''kareeb 259 bimariyon ke kharch main badlaav hoga
 Out of this, the cost of 200 diseases will be increased, while the cost of 59 diseases will be less than before
 '' nae tarriff kii ghoshnaa isi hafte kii ja sakati he
 Significantly, on 23 September, the Ayushman Bharat Scheme has been completed for one year
 kharch kii seemaa main badhotaree yaa kami karne main sarkaar ne is baar nai tarkeeb apanaai he
 The change in treatment cost is based on the medicine given to the patient rather than according to any disease
 yani sharir ke ek ang main kai tarah kii bimaariyaan ho sakati he, lekin har beemaari main ek sa kharch aae yah jaruri nahin
 The most accurate identification of what is the disease can be done in the same way that the doctor has given the medicine to the patient
 isse yah spasht ho paaegaa ki darasal ilaaj main kitna paisa laganaa tarksangat he
 Bhushan says, "over the past year, there have been many cases
 kuch bimariyon main ilaaj kaa kharch kam laga to unako badhaayaa gaya
 But where expenses were not rational, they have also been reduced
 kuch sthitiyon main package main duplikisi thi
 All these things have been taken care of in the new changes
 '' sarkaar ne har beemaari ke liye ilaaj kaa kharch uchit rakhaa he, baaki har aspataal ke apane taur tareeke hone par isamen badlaav ho saktaa he
 Let us tell you that till now only about 18,000 hospitals are covered under Ayushman
 inamen sarkari or nijee donon tarah ke aspataal shaamil hai
 After the change in the tariff of treatment expenses by the government, whether the hospitals will bring themselves under the ambit of this scheme or keep the distance, it will be known only after the introduction of the new tariff
 zyada se zyada aspataalon ko jodna or sarkari aspataalon kaa infrastracchar sarkaar ke liye chunauti bana hua he
 After receiving fake complaint, the government has removed 97 hospitals from the list and imposed penalty of up to Rs 1 crore on some
 ab tak ayushmaan bharat ke antargat 10 karod se zyada labhaarthiyon ko jod liya gaya he
 The government aims to add about 50 crore members from 100 million poor families
 *** Terming the allegations of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi as 'completely baseless and shameful' about Narendra Modi taking money from Sahara and Birla as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, BJP on Wednesday said that the Prime Minister is as holy as Ganga and Agusta is an attempt to divert attention from the investigation into the Westland case, in which the names of Congress leaders and 'family' are appearing
 rahul gandhi par palatwaar karte hue kendriya mantri ravi shankar prasad ne kaha ki ye aarope congress netaa kii hataasha ko pradarshit karte hai or yah agasta westland maamle kii jaanch se dhyaan baantne kaa prayaas he, jisamen congress netaaon or 'parivaar' ke naam aa rahe hai
 Prasad told reporters at the BJP headquarters, 'the allegations leveled against the Prime Minister are baseless, wrong, shameful and malicious and are reflecting Rahul Gandhi's desperation to lead the party as one state after another His party is facing a crushing defeat
 ravishankar prasad ne is baat par aashcharya vyakt kiya ki rahul gandhi ne samprag sarkaar ke dauraan hue ghotaalon ko lekar aawaaj kyon nahin uthaai
 He said that the people of the country do not take the Congress vice-president seriously
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi khud samprag sarkaar ke 10 saalon ke shasankaal ke dauraan bhrashtachar ke sabase bad sahyogi rahe
 
 tab unhone ek shabd bhi nahin kaha jab congress ke shashan ke dauraan karodon rupee kii lut ho rahi thi'
 Prasad said, 'our Prime Minister is as holy as the Ganges River'
 unhone kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi kaha he ki in aaropon kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad was referring to the case in which the Supreme Court rejected the demand for a probe by the Special Investigation Team of the allegations against Modi
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki modi ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle do companiyon se 65 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Party spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said that Rahul Gandhi is immature and is only lying and the public does not take him seriously due to his lies
 tippaniyan He said, 'people of the country have stopped taking him seriously
 rahul gandhi jhooth bolte hai or jhuthe hai
 There is no fact in what they say
 ve keval apni or apni party kii aakshamata ko hi pradarshit kar rahe hai'
 It is noteworthy that Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday alleged that Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of Gujarat had taken money from Sahara and Birla groups and that there should be an independent inquiry
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he

 Read what they said - The Gujarat Police had found the clues in Gujarat on 26 July 2008
 gujarat police ne jaanch kii usase jo lead mili wo unhone intelligence agenciyon ke alaava sabhi rajyon kii police se bhi share kii
 Information was also shared with Delhi Police
 jab un leeds kodewalp kiya gaya, jisamen mukhya kaam inspector mohan chand sharma kaa tha, to dout gaya ek phone number par ki ye invold ho saktaa he
 Based on the lead, Mohan Chand Sharma's team conducted a search operation at Batla House but an encounter took place during this time
 encounter ke baad jo leeds mili usase puraa indian mujahiddeen kaa modul tha wo dhire-dhire dharaashai ho gaya
 Encounter was called fake! Controversy occurred on the encounter
 jinke nihitarth hai, ve hameshaa controvarsi creat karne kii koshish karte hai or us samay bhi yah kiya gaya
 There was a work pressure that you had to explain
 log shaq kar rahe the
 They had to clear whether it was not, which was shown by the team of Special Cell
 legal scrootni main bhi yah saaf ho gaya
 The team of the special cell did the work, after that the lead they got was shared with the Intelligence Agency and after that there were many successes
 jaise26 sitambar ko mumbai police ne indian mujahiddeen ke ek or modul kaa bhandaphod kiya
 Police of different states also got success
 yah sab sabit karata tha ki bottla house main jo log pakade gaye the ve indian mujahiddeen ke log the or unhone bahut sari jagah par blast kiye the
 Politics on Batla House! Apart from the leaders, there were some activists whose job is to oppose the action of the police
 lekin sach nahin badalata
 Our Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and his team were a close net team
 yah pehla mauka nahin tha ki team ne kisi aatankwaadi ko pakadaa ho yaa encounter hua ho
 The team also operated in Kashmir
 aisi team par aarope lagaana galat he or galat tha team ko aapas main baantne kii koshish
 Mohan got shot by terrorist, terrorist was also shot, 2 terrorists were killed and 2 escaped
 ek pakadaa bhi gaya vahaan se jisase aage kii leeds mili to sachai nahin badalati or sachai yahi thi ki mohan chand sharma ko aatankwaadi kii goli lagi thi
 Who wanted to join the team? There were many people, there were some activists whose name i would not like to name here
 netaaon kaa aapako maaloom he jo bole the tivi par
 Now there is no use in going to that dispute
 11 saal court main cese hue
 The NHRC investigated, petitions were filed in the High Court, Supreme Court, but the victory was true everywhere
 team ne jo kaam kiya uski vajah se indian mujahidin kamjor hua
 E-mails used to come after every blast
 upi court blast, jaipur blast, gujaratblast ke baad jo mail aae usamen unhone kaha ki hamaare aadmi sef hai or har i-mail main unhone police waalon ko dhamkee di ki ham aapako nahin chhodenge
 What happened after Batla House? Which email came? Which threat came? This indicates that the speed of the terrorists has reduced and many people have also been arrested
 aatankwaad par neshnal policy baneek neshnal policy aatankwaad par honi chahie
 Whether it is the government of a party, it should form a national policy
 vah har raajnneetik shaks par lagu honi chahie
 Only then can we unite to fight against terrorism

 robert wadra par aarope he ki rajasthan ke bikaner jile main jameen kharidne ke liye unhone kanoon todaa
 The issue of Robert Vadra's land purchase raises a serious question that the Rajasthan government even changed the land law

 In 2009, Vadra frontman Mahesh Nagar purchased 218 acres of land in Basti Chaunan village in Koyalat area of bikaner district
 nagar ne hi bikaner ke kolayat ilaake main robert wadra ke liye saare deal kiye
 On April 9, 2009, Mahesh Nagar purchased 218 acres on behalf of Real Earth Estates Private Limited
 nagar kaa wadra kaa rishta yah tha ki vah real arth privet limited kaa diarector tha
 The seller was Vineet Asopa of Avijit Agro Private Limited

 But Nagar was only authorized to sign, not the owner of the land
 land deal main real arth or blue brij naam kii jin do companiyon kii wo numaaindgi kar rahaa tha, usamen bada stekholder robert wadra hai
 For example, in Real Earth, Vadra holds 99 percent equity, while the remaining one percent is owned by his mother Maureen

 At first he promised to talk to Aaj Tak, but later retracted
 ye lenden rajasthan impojishan of ceiling on agricultural holdings act, 1973 kaa saaf-saaf ulanghan he
 Because Vadra crossed the maximum limit of holding 175 acres in April 2009
 wadra ne april 2009 or agast 2010 ke bich 321 acre se zyada jameen kharidi
 This was a violation of Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973
 registani or ardh registani ilaakon main wadra ke liye land ceiling ko adhiktam seemaa tak khinchaa gaya
 According to the law, 125 to 175 acres of land is allowed in desert and semi-desert areas

 Earlier, in 2009, when Vadra was buying land in Rajasthan, he ignored it

 Revenge Act for Vadra? In September 2010, the state government amended the law more than three decades old
 saath hi jameen par ceiling bhi khatm kar di
 The amendment added necessary rules to justify all the old acquisitions so that Vadra could buy more and more land in that area
 jahaan wadra ke ulanghan ko kanoonee jama pehanaane ke liye congress shasit rajya sarkaar ne land ceiling act main badlaav kar diya, vahi kareeb teen saal tak wo solar policy par bhi baithi rahi
 This was the period when Vadra prepared a big land bank in this area

 And the kids had a great time running after her with a live cockroach
 With Sri screaming in real terror
 And i had a ‘cockroach close up’ too 
 
 where the cockroach was sizing sridevi

 However, in recent years, the saffron party has ignored all the dignities and has openly embraced the rebels of other parties

 Earlier in September and October 2016, all the leaders of the Congress Legislature Party of Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur had switched sides to BJP
 natijatan, donon rajyon main maujuuda sarkarein buniyadi taur par congress or duusari partiyon se aae logon se milakar bani hai
 These include Arunachal Chief Minister Pema Khandu and his Manipuri counterpart Biren Singh

 Since then, he has been using his contacts and friends with BJP general secretary Ram Madhav to woo Congress and other regional party mlas to the BJP and has become a means of establishing bjp's roots in the Northeast
 yah sab pehali modi sarkaar ke tisare saal 2016 main shuru hua jab bhaajapa ke haq main dalbadal kaa tantaa lag gaya
 That year, eight Congress mlas from Uttarakhand, along with former Chief Minister Vijay Kumar Bahuguna, came to the bjp's court with full fervor
 yahi nahin, ve 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad rajya main gathit bhaajapa sarkaar main mantri bane
 In the beginning of the year, before the general elections in May 2019, this defective exercise took a lot of momentum
 ab jab bhaajapa ne shandaar janadesh hasil kar liya he, apana laav-lashkar chhodkar jeetne vaale ghode par daanv lagane vaale raajnneetikon kii taadaad lagaataar bad rahi he
 Especially at a time when the Congress looks like a sinking ship, the dominance of regional parties has declined and the BJP has become a tremendous political force in the country
 aankadon kii ahmiyatbhajapa ko koi shikaayat yaa takalif bhi nahin he
 Party leaders call it Chanakya policy or politics of need

 The series began in November 2017 in West Bengal with the defection of Mamata's ally Mukul Roy, culminating in the bjp's best performance in the May general elections this year
 karnataka or goa main is july main bade paimaane par hue dalbadal kii badaulat bhaajapa ne donon rajyon main sarkarein banaain
 It would not be surprising to see this success of defection politics, if the party will soon take recourse in Tamil Nadu and Kerala as well
 yahaan tak ki upree sadan main bhi, jahaan bhaajapa ko apane dam par bahumat hasil nahin tha, party ne teen talaak or anuchhed 370 sareekhe ahm vidheyak paarit karwaane ke liye baagi saansadon kaa hi sahaara liya

 The leader of the second party is thoroughly scrutinized before being taken into the party
 aisa nahin he ki bhaajapa main aane ke icchhuk har netaa ko party main le liya jaataa he

 They feel that the larger moral objectives are being sacrificed for the benefits of short term, which is an attack on 'value-based politics'
 abivipi ke ek purv netaa kehete hai, ''party ke liye upyogi ban chuke kai bahari netaaon kaa aana bataata he ki rajnatik taur par jo sahi he or jo aniatik he, donon ke bich lakeer kai baar dhundhlee ho jaati he

 or bhala kyon nahin, aakhir kabhi duusare dalon se alag hone kaa daawa karne vaali party main jo apwaad hota tha, vah aae din ghatit ho rahaa he

 Sources also say that in the 2019 elections, the BJP gave tickets to ideologically strong candidates, while the general perception was that it was importing leaders from other parties
 magar jahaan party kamjor he, vahaan duusari partiyon se netaaon ko laane main hi rajnatik samajhadaari he
 Many of the Sangh people are ready to tolerate the politics of defection as long as it serves the larger objectives of the RSS — the Uniform Civil Code, the abolition of Article 370 and the Ram Temple in Ayodhya

 hooda khaas taur par manohar laal khatter ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ke kathith bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne kii muhim chalaane ko qamar kas rahe hai
 For the Congress high command in Delhi, the party's Haryana unit is going to have a headache in the coming weeks
 sambhavat: november main haryana vidhansabha chunaav se pehle pradesh ke party netaa apana shakti pradarshan dikhaane kii taiyaari main hai
 Before the crucial assembly elections in Haryana, the demand for change in the state organization of the party is gaining momentum
 loksabhaa chunaav main party kii karaari haar ke sadame se congress netaa abhi tak nahin ubhare hai
 Hooda's son Deepender Hooda also lost this time from the Rohtak seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 deependra hooda ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood rohtak seat se jeet hasil kii thi
 Deepender Hooda's defeat was no less than that former Chief Minister Hooda also lost from Sonipat Lok Sabha seat
 haalanki congress alaakaman ko abhi haryana main party kii haar ke kaarnon kii samiksha ke saath jimmedaari tay karnaa baaki he lekin hooda puure tevar ke saath maidan main hai
 He has called a meeting of his supporters in Delhi on Sunday to give a message to the party high command
 hooda vidhansabha chunaav ke liye july se abhiyaan shuru karne main jute hai
 a party leader said, "every week there will be a disclosure related to the activities of the Khattar government
 bhartiyon se lekar khanan tak khatter sarkaar gale tak bhrashtachar main dubi he, ham use janata ke saamne benakaab karenge
 " ienex media bhrashtachar maamle main aaj congress netaa pi chidambaram ne poochtacha ke liye sibiai ke saamne aane se inkaar kar diya
 Chidambaram's lawyer went to CBI headquarters today and said that his clients could not come
 iske saath hi vakil ne kaha ki jab tak maamle kii sunwaayee dilli hoicourt main ho rahi he, tab tak unhen na bulaayaa jaae
 Meanwhile, seeing the sword of arrest hanging, Chidambaram filed a petition in the Delhi High Court
 is maamle main court ne aaj sunwaayee karte hue unki giraftaar par 3 july tak ke liye roak laga di he
 Along with this, the court has also said that Chidambaram should go to the CBI office, aiding in the inquiry
 hoicourt ne kaha he ki is maamle main agali sunwaayee ab 3 july ko hogi
 Earlier, Chidambaram got relief in the aircel-maxis deal

 Announcing the order, Special Judge OP Saini directed him to join the investigation of the case on June 5

 The court has fixed June 5 for further hearing in the case, asking the ED to file a response to Chidambaram's anticipatory bail plea
 isse pehle, adaalat ne airsel-mexis deal maamle mempi
 Providing interim protection to Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram, his arrest was stayed until 10 July
 kendriya jaanch beuro or pravartan nideshaalay yah pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki karti ke pita pi
 When Chidambaram was finance minister in 2006, how did he (karti) get approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in the aircel-maxis deal
 maaloom ho ki karti chidambaram dwaara saal 2006 main airsel-mexis deal ke tahat videshi nivesh sanvardhan board (exipibi) kii manjuuri milane ke maamle kii jaanch CBI or ED kar rahe hai

 According to the ED, the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram in the aircel-maxis deal was approved without the permission of the Cabinet Committee, while the deal was worth Rs 3500 crore
 niyamon ke mutabik vittamantri 600 karod rupee tak kii deal ko hi manjuuri de sakate the
 The FIPB sent the file to the Finance Minister and they approved it
 march 2016 main khatm hone vaale maujuuda kaarobaari varsh main desh kii gramin arthvyavastha main susti bani rah sakati he
 Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service (MIS) made this estimate on Tuesday
 mudies kaa kehnaahai ki yah purvanumaan haalanki puri tarah tabhi lagu hoga, jab monsooni barish ausat se kam hogi
 According to MIS Vice President and Senior Research Analyst Rahul Ghosh, "A weak rural economy will increase pressure on private consumption and non-performing assets in agriculture, which will be negative for the credit of the country and banks
" ''gramin aay vruddhi dar bahut kam'yah baat ems ke tremasik prakaashan insaide india ke taaja sanskaran main kahi gai he
 According to the report, the rural income growth rate in the country so far has been less than 5 percent in 2015 as compared to 20 percent in 2011
 report mendesh main kiye ja rahe sudharonke bare main kaha gaya ki desh main bahudaleey, sangheey loktantr ke kaaran nitiyon ko lagu hone main samay lagata he
 According to the report, most of the policies are going to strengthen the institutional strength of the country, but these reforms may take several years to see their impact
 (input: IANS) The results of the assembly elections have come
 uttar pradesh main sapa kii lahar chali, to punjab main prakaash singh badal par janata ne ek baar phir bharosa jataayaa
 In Goa, BJP cleared the Congress
 vahiin uttarakhand main bhaajapa or congress ke bich kaante kii takkar he
 Congress won unilaterally in Manipur
 in nateezon se ek baat saaf ho gai he ki congress party ko vidhansabha chunaavon main karaara jhatka laga he
 Especially in UP, where the party made claims of miraculous results with the help of its 'crown Prince' Rahul Gandhi
 darasal party ne jane-anjaane main upi chunaav ko rahul kii pratishtha kii ladaai bana di
 The brunt of which the party and Rahul Gandhi both suffered
 vipakshi partiyon se lekar raajnneetik vishleshak chunaav main party kii is sharmnaak pradarshan ke liye unhen jimmedaar tehraane main jute hai
 So a new camp was formed inside the Congress party
 jiskaa mantra he
 
 
 'rahul Bachao Morcha' Actually Congress leaders were not expecting the startling results beforehand
 iskaa pehla ishaara party ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne de diya tha
 After the end of the seventh phase election, Digvijay Singh had said that if the party wins in the state then it will be Rahul's victory and in the event of defeat it is my defeat
 digvijay singh ne darasal is bayaan ke jariye party ke netaaon ko ek ishaara de diya tha ki kharaab nateezon ke baad rahul bachaao morcha par lag janaa hoga
 Which is being practiced by every big and small leader of the party
 upi chunaav main behtareen parinaam dene ke liye rahul gandhi ke saath party ke kai mantri upi kii ranbhumi main lamaband hue
 Law Minister Salman Khurshid in this group of ministers
 kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma, koyala mantri shriprakash singh jaiswal, jagdambika paal, congress mahasachiv digvijay singh jaise kai bade naam the
 The sad part for the party is that so many leaders had come forward for the responsibility of defeat, if i had played such a responsible role during the election campaign, the results would have been better
 par congressiyon ke bayaan ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa hai
 Because if the opposition attacks Rahul Gandhi, the party's last claim before the 2014 general elections will also fail in the anti-corruption atmosphere
 aise main is sharmnaak haar ke liye kaiyon ko qurbaaniyaan bhi deni pad sakati he
 Whose command will be decided by him only
 philhal netaa apana 'rahul bachaao' dharm nibhaayenge
 But there is a saying, 'name is big and philosophy is small'
 congress party ke pradarshan is kahawat ko sarthak sabit kar diya
 Now when the circumstances are opposite, these leaders started practicing their religion, which is considered part of the culture of the Congress party
 yani hikeman ke liye kuch bhi karegaa
 Digvijay Singh came to the media after the defeat
 chehre par wo kutir muskaan nahin thi
 Blamed himself for the defeat
 saath hi rahul gandhi ke bachaav karte hue haar kaa sara thikra sthaneey netritv par phod daalaa
 And indicated that he would resign from the post of party general secretary
 kuch aisa hi shriprakash jaiswal ne bhi kiya
 Describing the results as shocking, i said that i am responsible for this defeat
 or jarurat padi to istipha bhi dene ko taiyaar hum
 His high command devotion can be gauged from the fact that he gave up his life for the party
 vahiin congress party kii pradesh adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi ne bhi haar kii jimmedaari le daali
 The People's Liberation Army of China recently infiltrated the Indian border region through water and land two routes
 usne pangong jhil main bhartiya jalseema main apane sainik bhejne ke saath-saath isi kshetra main jamini raste se bhi bhartiya seemaa main paanch kilometre kii duuri tak apane sainik bhej die

 Sources said that while India was making its stand in relation to its claim on the region during the negotiations, the Chinese army built a specially paved road here and claimed that it was part of the Aksai Chin region of the region is
 sutron ne kaha ki china ne 'finger 4' kshetra tak ek sadak kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The area falls under the Siri chanting area and is within five kilometers of the Line of Actual Control
 ek hi samay main bhartiya jal kshetra main ghusane ko china sena dwaara ilaake kii nigaraanee main lage bhartiya sainikon par manovaigyanik dabaav daalane ke kadam ke taur par dekha rahaa he
 Chinese patrols frequent the northern and southern sides of the lake

 Indian soldiers have high-speed interceptor boats purchased from the US, which can carry up to 15 soldiers
 in naavon main radar, inphra-red or jeepies pranali lagi he
 These boats are capable of Chinese ships and are used for reconnaissance and patrolling
 jhil ke kinaaron par halaat hameshaa asthir bane rahete hai
 In May last year, Indian army patrols have intercepted Chinese troops several times following a three-week standoff in the Depsang plains of Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO)
 achaanak sadak par aae pradarshnkarimasjidon se hui apil, sadak se hate loganagarkita sanshodhan kanoon (CAA) ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Demonstrations turned violent at several places on Tuesday
 haalanki, dilli police ke mutabik masjidon se apil karne ke baad pradarshnkaree sadak se hate or shanti behaal hui
 Earlier, protesters set fire to a police station at Seelampur in Delhi here

 In addition, DTC buses were vandalized along with stone pelting by protesters
 police ne 3 exiaar darj kisthaneey logon ne kaha ki police ne maukey par pradarshnakariyon par lathicharge kar aansu gas ke gole chode
 Demonstrations were held to show solidarity with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia University and lodge a protest against the Nagarkita Amendment Act (CAA)
 vahiin, silampur or brijpuri main hui hinsa ke baad police ne teen exiaar darj kii he
 The protesters turned violent, Joint Police Commissioner Alok Kumar of Delhi Police said, 'for about an hour, the protesters demonstrated peacefully at Seelampur Chowk
 is dauraan police bhi unhen samajhaati rahi ki shanti banaae rakhen
 Then some people in the crowd moved here and some of them started stone pelting
 iske baad unhone gadiyon main bhi tod-phod kii
 In response, the police released tear gas shells and followed them to overcome them
 kareeb ek ghante tak aisa hi chalata rahaa
 After this, the people of the Aman Committee of the area appealed for peace
 madrason or masjidon se aman-chaiyn kii apil kii gai jiske baad se ilaake main shanti he
 Alok Kumar said, 'the situation is now completely under control
 kuch pulisavaalon ko chot bhi lagi he
 The mirrors of two buses have been broken
 ek rapid ection force kii bas ko todaa gaya he
 Some bikes have also been broken
 'aman cameti se police kii vaartaunhone kaha, 'ham yani police aman cameti se lagaataar baat kar rahi he
 Has been doing it earlier also
 hamaari koshish rahati he ki us ilaake jitne bhi ganmaanya log hai unke dwaara yuvaaon ko samajhaayen or unhen shant rakhen
 Also, through them, there is an effort to convey the message to the youth that the police is there for their protection
 'dilli police ke joint police kamishnar alok kumaar ne kaha ki pradarshan se pehle isaki kisi prakaar kii soochna nahin thi
 Suddenly people came on the road
 lekin jaise hi pradarshan shuru hua police bal bhi vahaan tainaat kar diya gaya
 Another police officer said, 'the protesters started throwing stones at the traffic

 Many people have been injured in these clashes between police and protesters
 bijli main wo takat he, jo sirf aap kaa ghar hi roshan nahin karti, balki chunaavon main sarkarein bhi badal detii he
 The recent Delhi election is a great example of this
 ab mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal sasti bijli kaa vaada kar satta main to pahunche hai, lekin sawaal ye he ki bijli aegi kahaan se
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attack on Arvind Kejriwal did not stop even after the election and during the country's first renewable energy conference, he again attacked and said that those who do not have electricity, they claim to provide cheap electricity
 isi ke maddenjar aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli ke liye paanch sutri agenda banaaya he
 1
 ghar main lagane vaali solar unit par sabsidi dena
 2
 betry or solar upkaran par tex kam karnaa
 3
 jhuggiyon or kam aay vaale gharon ko solar urja kii praathamikta suchi main rakhana
 4
 kul bijli jarurat kaa kam se kam 20fisadi solar urja utpaadan karnaa
 5
 yojana taiyaar karnaa taaki log solar bijli utpaadan kar use bech saken
 It is not that with the coming of solar the dependence on grid power will be reduced and the government's headache will be reduced
 balki solar dilliwaalon ke liye saugat sabit ho sakati he
 There may be a third reduction in your total electricity expenditure
 aamtaur par solar energy ke khilaaf pehla tark ye diya jaataa he ki dilli main iske plant lagane laayak jameen hi maujuud nahin
 But experts believe that there will be no shortage of land if Kejriwal government
 dilli ke paas badi sankhya main aisi building hai jahaan bade plant lagaae ja sakate hai 
 If there is solar power generation in Delhi itself, then the question of transmission losses will not arise
 DERC net metering yojana par kaam kar chuki he
 That is, if the government puts solar panels in your house, then if more electricity is produced than consumed, that electricity will go back into the grid and its money will also get minus in your bill i
e
 mango mangoes, and the cost of kernels
 solar power ko ranneetik rup se dilli main lagu karne main sabase bada chalange iskaa manhagaa hona he
 Clearly, subsidy is a major need in this initiative and subsidy is the biggest headache of Kejriwal government at present after electricity and water

 abhibhavakon ne apane bacchon kaa admician sarvoday kanya vidhyalay main karaayaa tha lekin ab skool management 50 se zyada bacchon ko duusare skool main shift karnaa chahta he
 Outraged by this, the parents shouted and raised slogans outside the school and also tried to block the road outside the school
 abhibhavakon or students kaa aarope he ki skool prashasan apni manmani kar rahaa he
 The principal is also completely silent on this issue
 apana paksh rakhte hue logon kaa kahana he ki jis skool main ladakiyon ko transfar karne kii koshish prashasan kar rahaa he wo ghar se 4-5 kilometre duuri par he
 Children will have a lot of trouble on daily commuting from such a distance
 k i abhibhavakon ne kaha ki 6 saal se 14 saal tak ke bachche ko 3 kilometre ke daayre main hi admician mili yah uskaa adhikaar he
 But due to the arbitrariness of the school administration, children and parents are facing a lot of problems

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday greeted the countrymen on the occasion of Hindi Day (hindi Diwas) and said that Hindi can work to tie the country to the door of unity
 modi ne tivetor par kaha, 'hindi diwas par aap sabhi ko bahut-bahut badhai
 The simplicity, spontaneity and decency of the language give meaning to the expression
 hindi ne in pahaluon ko khubsuurati se samahit kiya he
 'amit Shah tweeted,' On the occasion of Hindi Diwas today, i appeal to all the citizens of the country to increase the use of our mother tongue and also use Hindi language as one of the languages of the country
 Let's contribute in realizing the dream of revered Bapu and Iron Man Sardar Patel
 ' hindi diwas par aap sabhi ko bahut-bahut badhai
 The simplicity, spontaneity and decency of the language give meaning to the expression
 hindi ne in pahaluon ko khubsuurati se samahit kiya he
 Giving good wishes on Hindi Day, he said that India is a country of different languages and every language has its own importance but it is very important to have a language of the whole country which should become the identity of India in the world
 shah ne kaha ki aaj desh ko ekta kii door main baandhane kaa kaam agar koi ek bhashaa kar sakati he to wo sarvaadhik bole jane vaali hindi bhashaa hi he
 Today, on the occasion of Hindi Day, i appeal to all the citizens of the country that we should increase the use of our mother tongue and also use Hindi language, realizing the dream of Bapu and iron man Sardar Patel of one language of the country
 Contribute to doing hindi diwas kii hardik shubhakamanaayenbhaspa ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ne kaha ki hindi bharat main sarvaadhik boli evam samajhi jane vaali bhashaa he jo ham sabhi bharatiyon ko ekta ke sutara main piroti he evam vishwa main hamaari pahchaan bhi he
 He said, 'A hearty Hindi day to all of you
 aaie ham sabhi apane dainik jivan main hindi ke prayog ko badhayen evam dusron ko bhi prerit karen
 Sardar Patel's critics are no more outspoken, but whenever his fans start praising him, he is not able to say much in praise of Patel other than joining the princely states in the Union of India
 iske baad prashansak patel kii tarif karne ke bajaay pandit nehru kii mirch-masala lagaakar buraai karne lagate hai or ant main jod dete hai ki agar nehru kii jagah patel hote to aisa karte
 He considers Nehru's unwanted condemnation as a compliment to Patel
 is tarah kii prashansa sirf itnaa hi dikhaati he ki ye prashansak na to nehru ko lekar gambhir hai or na unhen patel se hi koi dili muhabbat he
 They are just using Patel to prove their point
 thik vaise hi jaise mahatma gandhi kii ninda karne kaa bahaanaa khojane ke liye subhash chandra bose yaa sardaar bhagat singh kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 By the way, all this comparative condemnation program gets winded by the serious ideological differences between Nehru and Patel
 donon netaa khud bhi is baat ko maanate the ki aarthik nitiyon or sampradayikta ke mudde par unke vichaaron main buniyadi fark he
 But both also believed that they agreed to work with mutual disagreement
 nehru or patel ke bich 1948 se 1950 ke bich hue patr vyavhaar se pataa chalata he ki ek daur aisa bhi aayaa jab nehru or patel donon ko jimmedaari ke saath yah laga ki un donon main se kisi ek ko bharat sarkaar se alag ho janaa chahie
 And both of them said that it would be better to resign himself so that the other can better handle the country
 isse bhi badi baat yah ki baapu bhi yah sochane lage the ki donon netaaon main se kisi ek ko chuttee de di jaae, taaki doosraa behatar dhang se desh ko chalaa sake
 It is astonishing that both leaders had this feeling at a time when Mahatma Gandhi was on the last fast of his life in January 1948 and Delhi was being burdened with refugees
 lekin donon netaa yah bhi jaanate the ki agar ve aise samay main ek duusare se alag hote hai, jab desh majahabi dangon kii aag main jal rahaa he, mahatma gandhi upwas par baithe hai or nai-nai sarkaar abhi chalanaa shuru karne vaali he, to puri duniya main na sirf bharat ke bare main galat sandesh jayega, balki deshvirohi tatv iskaa laabh uthaaenge
 In such a situation, it was decided that this dispute should be resolved with Mahatma Gandhi
 pehle nehru ji ne apana paksh rakhte hue ek draft gandhi ji ko bhej diya or uski prati patel kaa patha di
 Patel did the same thing the next day
 ab faisla sabarmati ke sant ko karnaa tha
 There is no harm in knowing that Patel had written in a letter to Gandhiji that if Jawaharlal and you are hurt by my behavior, it is better, now you free me
 vahiin nehru kaa kahana tha ki agar pradhanmantri swatantra rup se apana kaam nahin kar saktaa to ve yah pad chhod dena chaahate hai
 Apart from this, while Nehru was accepting Bapu's fast in spite of all the miseries, Patel felt it to be a lot of strict action on his own people
 nehru vaali baat kii tasdik mukhyamantriyon ko likhe nehru ji ke patr se hoti he, jabaki patel vaali baat ko gandhi ji kii jeevani ‘anmol viraasat’ main unki pautri sumitra kulkarni or moulana aaazaad ne apni kitaab ‘india vins freedom’ main behatar dhang se samajhaayaa he
 Maulana even goes so far as to say that Patel's behavior was filled with concern for Gandhiji
 baharhaal aazaadee ke chah maheene ke bheetar rashtrapita ko apane do sipahasalaron main se ek ko chunanaa tha
 For this it was necessary that the three people sit together and then a decision is made
 lekin yah meeting kabhi ho nahin pai
 The meeting was fixed on 31 January 1948, but the day before that the Mahatma was assassinated
 haa, ek cheez jarur hui ki hatya vaale din patel gandhi ji se mili or donon ne kareeb ek ghante saath gujaarey
 In this meeting, Gandhiji told Patel that in the present situation it is not possible to remove either of them
 aap donon ko milakar hi kaam karnaa hoga
 Patel himself told this to Nehru
 baapu kii hatya ne halaat ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 On 3 February 1948, Nehru wrote a letter to Sardar, 'now everything has changed after Bapu's death and now we have to face a completely different and more difficult world
 puraane vivaadon or jhagadon kaa ab bahut mahatv nahin rah gaya he
 It is imperative that we all come closer and work collaboratively
 beshak doosraa koi maarg nahin he
 In the same letter, Nehru said that whenever there was a dispute, both of them would reach a conclusion after a long conversation
 do din baad javaabi patr main patel ne jo likhaa vah tarikhi he, ‘patr main vyakt kiye gaye sneh or sahrudayata kaa mujh par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he- asal main unhone mujhe abhibhoot kar liya he
 'both leaders agreed to their supreme leader
 or kis kadar maani isaki baangi donon ke bich patel kii mrityu tak chale samvaad se milti he
 Nehru was so distressed by the violence in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) in March 1950 that he made up his mind to resign from his post
 is baat kii soochna unhone patel ke alaava rajendra prasad ko bhi di
 But here again, Patel referred to the letters of February 1948 and referred to Bapu's last will to Nehru regarding their relationship
 rashtrapita ke aakhri farmaan se donon hi bandhe the or donon saath bane rahe
 But, despite the ideological opposition, the story of two big leaders full of mutual respect will be understood by the critics, whose hollow nationalism stands on denial
 behatar hoga ve nehru se na sahi to patel se hi rashtrawaad kaa arth samajhane kii koshish karen
 In doing so, they may also find a context to truly praise the Iron Man without diminishing anyone's stature

 In-form KL Rahul's injury before the second Test match between India and New Zealand was a shock for Team India
 rahul kii jagah dilli ke baayen haath ke ballebaaj gautam gambhir ko team main sthaan diya gaya jabaki ek anya openar shikhar dhawan pehle hi team main maujuud the
 So on the first day, the curiosity of the cricket enthusiasts was about who among Shikhar Dhawan and Gautam Gambhir will be chosen as Murali Vijay's associate opener
 ye donon ballebaaj aakraamak andaaj main khelte hue teji se score badhaane main yakeen rakhte hai
 Ultimately, the verdict went in favor of Shikhar Dhawan, popularly known as 'gabbar'
 dhawan or gambhir, donon ke apane 'plus' or 'mines' point the
 Where there was talk in favor of Gautam Gambhir that he did well with the bat recently in the Duleep Trophy
 iske alaava test cricket main unka ausat behtareen (42
 58) has been
 vahiin agast 2014 ke baad koi test nahin khelnaa tathaa 35 varsh kii umr hona unke khilaaf ja rahaa tha
 Gautam Gambhir and captain Virat Kohli were also being raised in the media for not being comfortable
 dhawan ke lihaaj se baat karen to gautam ke mukaable kam umr kaa hona or captain kohli kaa vishwast hona unke paksh main mana gaya
 He is only slightly behind Gambhir in batting average (40
 16) hai, lekin unka haal kaa pradarshan koi khaas nahin rahaa he
 The comments westeindies ke khilaaf, carabian maidaanon par hui siries ke pehle test main unhone 84 ran banaakar acchhee shuruyaat kii thi lekin iske baad agali teen pariyon main ve 54 ran hi bana paae the
 failure to score runs , the way Dhawan was dismissed was causing concern for the management
 unhone zyaadaatar baar gairjimmedaarana shotkhelte hue apana wicket ganvaaya
 Anyway, after playing a blistering innings of 187 runs against Australia in the first test of his career, Dhawan has lacked consistency
 unka ballebaaji pradarshan 'kabhi achche or kabhi kamjor' ke bich jhulata rahaa he
 In 2015, Dhawan could not score a big score in the series against South Africa and he missed the loss of wickets after being set
 mohali main hue siries ke pehle test main to ve donon pariyon main 0 par out hue the
 In such a situation, it was not easy for captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble to choose between Shikhar and Gambhir
 aakhirkaar shikhar dhawan ko team main sthaan mila
 It was a different matter that Dhawan could not take advantage of this opportunity in the first innings and bowled at Watling's ball after scoring just one run
 wicket par nigaah jamaaye bina unhone aade balle se cat shot lagane kii koshish kii or apana wicket or hasil hua mauka ganvaa baithe
 Naturally, after this failure, the decision to place him in the playing XI would be questioned, preferring Gambhir
 
 Both Dhawan and Gambhir had their 'plus' and 'minus' points
 jahaan gautam gambhir ke paksh main yah baat thi ki unhone dalip trophy main haal hi main balle se acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Also his average in Test cricket is excellent (42
 58) rahaa he
 At the same time, not playing any test after August 2014 and being 35 years old was going against him
 gautam gambhir or captain viraat kohli ke rishte sahaj na hone ke baat bhi media main uthaai ja rahi thi
 Talking about Dhawan, being younger than Gautam and confident of captain Kohli was considered in his favor
 ballebaaji ausat main ve gambhir se thode hi peeche (40
 16), but his recent performance has not been special
 tippaniyan In the first test of the series on the Caribbean grounds, he started well by scoring 84 runs against West Indies but after that he was able to score 54 runs in the next three innings
 ran banane main naakaami se kahin adhik dhawan ke out hone kaa tarika prabandhan ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran ban rahaa tha
 He lost his wicket most of the time, playing non-responsible shots
 vaise bhi apane kariyar ke pehle test main australia ke khilaaf 187 ranon ke dhamaakedaar pari khilne ke baad dhawan ke pradarshan main sthirataa kaa abhaav rahaa he
 His batting performance has been swinging between 'sometimes good and sometimes weak'
 2015 main dakshin africa ke khilaaf siries main bhi dhawan bada score nahin bana paae the or set hone ke baad wicket ganvaane kii chook unhen baari padi thi
 In the first test of the series in Mohali, he was dismissed at 0 in both innings
 aisi sthiti main shikhar or gambhir main kisi ek ko chunanaa captain viraat kohli or coach anil kumble ke liye aasaan nahin tha
 Eventually Shikhar Dhawan got a place in the team
 yah alag baat rahi ki dhawan pehali pari main to is maukey kaa laabh nahin uthaa sake or mahaj ek ran banaakar watling kii gend par bold ho gaye
 Without looking at the wicket, he tried to take a cut shot with the cross and lost his wicket and the chance he got
 swaabhaavik rup se, is naakaami ke baad gambhir par tarjeeh dete hue unhen plaing ilevan main sthaan dene ke faisle par sawaal to uthenge hi 
 
 westeindies ke khilaaf, carabian maidaanon par hui siries ke pehle test main unhone 84 ran banaakar acchhee shuruyaat kii thi lekin iske baad agali teen pariyon main ve 54 ran hi bana paae the
 More than the failure to score runs, the way Dhawan was dismissed was causing concern for the management
 unhone zyaadaatar baar gairjimmedaarana shotkhelte hue apana wicket ganvaaya
