 madhyapradesh main sharaab mafia se pareshaan ek congress vidhayak ne aaj dinabhar madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti main tufaan khadaa kar diya
 In fact, the government in Madhya Pradesh belongs to the Congress and after being badly disturbed by the liquor mafia, the Congress MLA was forced to resign
 dhar jile ke dharampuri se congress vidhayak panchilal meda ne mukhyamantri kamalnath ko apana likhit taur par istifa bheja to sarkaar ke mantriyon ne daud laga di or ruthe vidhayak ko manaane main jute gaye

 vahiin congress kii maane to vidhayak panchilal ne istipha nahin diya
 He was angry, but has convinced them
 lekin congress ye yakeenan maan rahi he ki jila prashasan unke saath sahyog nahin kar rahaa he

 At the same time, Bhanushali's parents have alleged that another BJP leader from Kutch has killed Bhanushali
 parijanon ke anusaar, bhanushaali or bijepi netaa chhabil patel main pichley lambey samay se raajnneetik ranjish chal rahi thi
 Chhabil Patel, who had left the Congress and joined BJP, was dismissed by the BJP from Abadasa seat due to which Bhanushali's leaf was cut
 raajnneetik jaankaar maanate hai ki abdasa se bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladane vaale chhabil patel ko bhanushaali ne chunaav ke dauraan koi madad nahin kii balki unke khilaaf cross voting karvaa kar harva diya
 Because of this, the enmity of the two became deeper
 iske baad naliya rape cese main bhi bhanushaali par chhabil patel ne hi aarope lagaae the
 However, due to lack of any concrete evidence in this case, the police refused to take any action
 video banaakar baar-baar blackmel bhi kiyiske baad donon ke bich ranjish or gahari ho gai
 Just then, a girl accused Bhanushali of bringing her to Ahmedabad in the name of entering an administration at the Fashion Design College and raped her inside the car
 yahi nahin, iskaa video banaakar baar-baar blackmel bhi kiya gaya
 However, after the FIR was filed in it, Chhabil Patel mediated after which the girl withdrew all the allegations made by herself in the High Court
 court ne bhanushaali par darj exiaar ko radd kar diya
 About 2 months ago, a woman from Delhi filed an FIR alleging rape, which was believed to be motivated by Bhanushali
 is vajah se chhabil, bhanushahi ko baar-baar maarane kii dhamkee de rahaa tha
 At the same time, people close to Bhanushali believe that this is a big political conspiracy
 darasal, bhanushaali lambey samay se gujarat main kendriya mantri purshottam rupala ko gujarat kaa mukhyamantri banane kii lobing kar rahe the
 Mutual rivalry is a political conspiracy
 a few days ago, he met Delhi BJP President Amit Shah in Delhi where he said that he has the support of 40 mlas
 yadi rupala ko mukhyamantri nahin banaaya gaya to vah apane vidhayakon ke saath alag ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, suspicion has arisen over the murder of Bhanushali that it is a mutual conspiracy that the former Gujarat BJP vice-president and former MLA Jayanti Bhanushali was shot dead in the moving train on monday-tuesday
 abdasa se vidhayak rahe bhanushaali, sayaji nagari train se bhuj se ahmedabad train ja rahe the
 Near Malia, miscreants entered the AC coach and fired on Bhanushali
 unki maukey par maut ho gai he
 Jayanthi Bhanushali was accused of raping a woman last year
 iske baad unhone gujarat bhaajapa ke upaadhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 However, Bhanushali said that it appears that the application given to the police is a conspiracy to tarnish my image
 mere or mere parivaar ke upar lagaae gaye aarope aadharahin hai
 On the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the party's establishment on the 76th birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram, party supremo Mayawati was welcomed by wearing such a life-like garland of shiny notes of thousands of rupees in the grand rally held at the sprawling Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in the capital
 People sitting far away kept speculating for a long time about which flowers the garland was made from
 mayawati raily sthal par helicopter se pahunchin or ghanto se intjaar main baithe samarthakon ne jaise hi unke helicopter ko akaash main dekha, swaagat main joardaar narebaaji shuru kar di or aasmaan main nile gubaare chode
 Beecho Beach had a single sofa on the huge platform for the party supremo
 ve manch par ain or haath hilaakar samarthakon kaa abhivadan kiya or sofe par baith gai
 After this, neither the flowers nor the bouquets, but his supporters brought a fluttering wreath like a life-size garland
 udhar manch par upasthit party ke bade netaa nasimuddin siddiki, lalji verma aadi apane party mukhiya ko maala pahana rahe the to dur baithe unke samarthak or yahaan tak ki print media ke log maala ke phulon kii jati, deshi he ki videshi kii kayaasabaaji main lage hue the
 After a lot of struggle, it was discovered that the garland was made with a noto of thousand rupees

 Three Bana dances based on the arrival of the BSP Raj and its achievements were also presented before the BSP chief addressed Mayawati Maharaeli and during that time the BSP workers present at the rally venue waved slogans and waved party flags
 The men and women volunteers of Bahujan Volunteer Force also danced in joy
 is dauraan achaanak chintaa kaa ek kshan bhi aayaa, jab mayawati ke sambodhan ke dauraan hi madhumakhiyon kaa ek jhund udaata hua raily ke upar pahunch gaya
 However, after wandering here and there after some time, this group went somewhere else and then the concern over everyone's forehead was over

 However, Sanjay Joshi has consistently denied having his hand in it

 com / blnvh5pmiy— PTI (@ptiofficial) February 19, 2019 There have been many allegations that the Pakistan Army is behind Imran Khan becoming Prime Minister and that the army had helped Imran Khan in the recent general election
 imran khan ke liye sirf sena hi nahin balki vahaan par maujuud aatankwaadiyon kaa rukh bhi hameshaa naram hi rahaa he
 Several times before the election, statements were made in favor of the army by Imran
 kai aatankwaadiyon ne bhi pakistan kii party ke liye chunaav main prachaar kiya tha
 Which clearly shows that Imran's policy is completely different from his promises
 aisa kai baar sabit ho chukaa he ki pakistani sena ke shah par khufia agency ISI or pakistan kii sarkaar bharat virdohi nitiyon ko lagu karti he
 Let me tell you that Imran Khan was seen threatening India in his address
 unhone kaha ki agar bharat hamaare khilaaf koi ection letaa he, to ham uskaa karaara jawaab denge
 Imran said that if India gives any evidence about the Pulwama terror attack, then he will definitely take action

 Everyone liked him because of his tailoring skills and his cheerful temperament
 magar raat hote hi achaanak wo darzi se qasaai ban jaataa
 People who sewed clothes in the day would have to wear shroud
 ab tak 33 katl karne kii baat wo khud maan chukaa he
 As the rest of the count is missing
 bataata ja rahaa he
 Yes, this news that came out of Bhopal is from the latest serial killer of the country
 sabase bada katilakai logon ko maut kii neend sulaane vaale kaatilon kii jamaat kaa sabase nayaa or badaserial killerpakada gaya he
 a serial killer who stitched people's clothes during the day and made people's shroud at night
 ji haa, peshey se darzi magar asal main serial killer
 a serial killer who is currently listening to the murder count of up to 33
 par ginati aage kahaan tak jaaegi kisi ko nahin pataa
 So let's meet this country's newest serial killer
 naam he aadesh khamaara
 He lives in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh
 us par ilzaam he 33 logon ke qatl kaa
 After the murder, again in 2010, there are reports of sudden killing of truck drivers and cleaners in many states of North India
 empi, upi, maharashtra, chhattisgarh or urisa main aae din laavaaris laashen baraamad hone lageen
 But all these incidents of murder had one thing in common
 jisaki bhi hatya kii gai wo sabhi trek driver the yaa unke sahyogi
 The murders were being carried out and the hands of the police were empty
 chunki zyaadaatar haive par sisitivi nahin lage hote hai, isliye police ko kaatil kaa suraag bhi nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 The clue of such a murderer started from 2010, this sequence of murder continues for the next eight years
 laashen milti rahati hai
 The murderer remains missing
 magar phir tabhi haal hi main bhopal ke nazadik bilakhiria ilaake main phir ek trek driver kii laash milti he
 But this time along with the corpse, the police also get a clue of the murderer
 serial kiling ke peeche puraa gangdrasal pehali baar mauka-e-vaardaat se police ko ek sandigdh miltaa he
 When he is interrogated, it is revealed that there is a whole gang behind this serial killing
 us gang kaa sargana koi or nahin balki bhopal kaa ek darzi he
 Tailor Order Khamara
 aadesh kii bhopal ke bahari ilaake main ek choti si tailor kii dukaan thi
 Where in the day he stitched clothes on the sewing machine and at night would wear shroud to the people
 2010 main kiya tha pehla katlserial killer aadesh ne 2010 main pehali hatya kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 First he drove the driver and cleaner Kakatalkia in Amravati, Maharashtra and then in Nashik
 iske baad to laashon ke milane kaa silsilaa hi chal padaa
 Several bodies were also found in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 darji samet 9 giraftaarye darzi in serial kiling kaa master mind to tha magar is vaardaat main kai or log bhi shaamil the
 Police have caught nine such people so far
 magar jab-jab darji munh kholta he laashon kii ginati babbti jaati he
 According to the Bhopal police, the order was nabbed from a forest in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh last week
 iske baad usne pehle 15, phir 25 phir 30 logon ke katl karne kii baat kahi
 But then one morning he tells the police that he has remembered the story of three more murders
 iske baad wo ginati 33 tak le jaataa he
 The police got all the answers
 Now obviously the police had to know why a tailor became a serial killer? Why did he only know the truck driver and the cleaner? How did he kill them? And for eight years, why did he never come in the eyes of the police? So the serial killer tailor gave the answer to all these questions along with the murder count
 moksh dilaane ke liye karata tha katldarzi katl dar qatl kahani suna rahaa tha or police hairaan-pareshaan kahani sun rahi thi
 Can anyone kill someone just to get salvation
 serial killer darji kii baton par yakeen karen to 33 katl main se har katl ke peeche uski bas ek hi soch thi or wo ye ki trek douvar or clinar kii zindagi badi takalifdeh hoti he
 He used to kill them just to get them out of that trouble

 In the web series, the use of derogatory words against former PM Rajiv Gandhi is catching on
 congress ke kuch netaaon ne is par aapatti jataai he
 On one hand, while there is anger among Congress leaders about the web series, the BJP is taking political advantage from it
 modi sarkaar ne alag se kaushal vikaas mantralay banaakar yuvaaon ko peshewar dhang se prashikshit karne kaa apana iraadaa saaf kiya he or is bare main pichhali sarkaar kii yojanaon ko aage badhaayaa he
 But what will make this government so different that it does not have to be satisfied with the modest success like the Manmohan government? Skill Development Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy revealed its specifics to India Today chief correspondent Santosh Kumar and Piyush Babelle
 kuch anshaikaushal vikaas kaa naaraa to purana he, aap isamen nayaa kya kar rahe hai?disambar 2013 main pehali baar neshnal skill qualification fremawork (enescuef) taiyaar kiya gaya
 Now every type of training in the country will be under NSQF
 2016 tak sarkaar se sahaayta praapt sabhi institute ko is fremawork se judana hoga or 2019 tak sarkari naukari ke liye bhi enescuef certificate jaruri ho jaaenge
 In this way, we will be able to implement the standard of professional training in the country, which is running in developed countries
 lekin isi manshaa se ai upie sarkaar kii 2009 main kaushal vikaas niti to patari se utar chuki he
 The 2009 policy had set a target to train 50 crore youth
 inamen 5 karod 2009 se 2012 ke bich or 45 karod log 2012 se 2017 ke bich prashikshit hone the, ye lakshya nahin paae ja sake
 That is why the visionary Prime Minister Narendra Modi created a separate ministry for skill development in November 2014 and this year a new National Skill Development Policy is also being brought
 enescuef asal main hoga kaisaa?isamen ek se lekar 10 tak level honge
 For example, level one and two certificates will be for welder or fitter, labels 3 and 4 will be for supervisor
 isi tarah label 9 or 10 kaa certificate emdi jaise padon ke liye hoga
 That is, people will have a certificate that will tell the industries what skills they have
 ye certificate itii yaa schuli certificate se cas alag honge?ab theory ke saath training kii hissedari badhaai jaani he jaise 9veen kaksha main 700 ghante theory or 300 ghante training jaruri hogi
 The same ratio will be 600: 400 in 10th, 500: 500 in 11th and 400-600 in 12th
 yani class ke saath training kaa hissaa badhata jayega
 The children will get a NSQF level certificate along with a tenth certificate
 yah certificate use turant naukari paane main madadgaar hoga
 But where will the trainers come from and the money to trend such a large population? 5 lakh crore rupees to trend 25 crore youth in five years

 aakhri taarikh17 july 2017 Yakub Memon, convicted of the 1993 Mumbai blasts, may be hanged soon
 aaiye jaanate hai, koun he yaqub memon
 
 
 The full name of Yakub Memon is Yakub Abdul Razzaq Memon
 yaqub kaa janm 30 july 1962 ko mumbai main hua tha
 He was a chartered accountant by profession
 memon parivaar main yaqub sabase padhaa likhaa vyakti he or vah tab se jail main he jab nepal police ne use kathmandu se giraftaar karke bhartiya jaanch agency sibiai ko saunpa tha
 He was running an account-related firm, through which he used to handle the illegal finance of his brother Tiger Memon
 memon indira gandhi open uniwarsity se political science main masters kii padhai kar rahaa he
 Last year, Yakub Memon has appeared for the MA Second Year Examination
 yaqub ne 2013 main ignu se angreji main post grajuation kii degree hasil kii he
 He is lodged in Nagpur Central Jail after being sentenced to death
 yaqub memon kii punarvichaar yachika ko khaarij karte hue supreme court ne uski faansee barkaraar rakhi thi
 The President has also rejected Yakub's mercy petition last year
 memon ke vakeelon ne faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main badalane kii maang kii thi
 Yakub's lawyers argued that he was only involved in the conspiracy of the blasts and not in carrying out the blasts

 Following the approval of Telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) resignation and recommendation of dissolution of the assembly, Abodisane has also demanded early elections
 mana ja rahaa he kikesiaraki tarj par mukhyamantrinavin patnayakabhi istipha dekar jaldi chunaav kaa daanv khilne vaale hai
 Let us know that Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram assembly elections are due later this year
 inhen chaaron rajyon ke sathateluganake bhi vidhansabha chunaav hone kii sambhaavna bad gai he
 With this, elections are expected to be seen in Odisha too
 vidhi ayog ne apni draft report main kaha tha kiloksabhaaor rajyon kii vidhansabhaon ke ek saath chunaav hone chahie, lekin iske liye rajya ko chunaav ke liye rajamand hona jaruri he
 From the point of view of the Law Commission, the possibility of general elections to be held before the scheduled time has begun to appear
 telugana vidhansabha bhang ke baad chunaav ayog aaj chunaav kii sambhaavna talashne ke liye baithak karne ja rahaa he
 As soon as the Assembly is dissolved, the Commission is trying to elect the Telangana Assembly along with Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram
 haalanki telugana gathan ke baad 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi is rajya kii vidhansabha chunaav hue the
 If seen in this way, there was still 8 months left and Telangana elections are held with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijedy saansad pinaki mishra ne dilli main chunaav ayog se mulaakaat kar kaha ki agar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav samay se pehle karaae jane kaa nirnay kiya jaataa he to odisha ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi saath karaae jaaen
 Mishra said that the BJP plans to hold elections simultaneously to the Lok Sabha and 11 Rajya Sabha
 aise main odisha ko bhi ek desh ek chunaav main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 He said that separate elections would cost the state government Rs 1000 crore, which cannot be spent on a developing state like Odisha, while simultaneous election expenses are shared by both the central and state government
 ab taaja ghatnakram ke baad ayog charchaa karegaa ki kya november main hi chaar rajyon ke saath saath telugana main bhi chunaav kara hi die jaae
 In this meeting of the Commission to be held today, along with other issues, the political situation in Telangana and the state's socio cultural events or festival festival will also be discussed in November
 haalanki ye behad shuruaati charchaa hogi lekin isse sambhaavnaaon ke daravaaje khulenge
 After Telangana, elections are expected to start in Odisha as well
 naveen patnayak pehle bhi ek desh ek chunaav kaa samarthan kar chuke hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also repeatedly insisted on holding Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections simultaneously
 niti ayog kii baithak main bhi mukhyamantriyon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone yahi baat dohraayi thi
 Interestingly, Odisha Chief Electoral Officer Surendra Kumar had issued a written order to all district collectors in the month of June, seeking a report on possible electoral expenditure
 saath hi yah bhi kaha tha ki chunaav ayog ko chunaav main aavashyak prabandhan par report den taaki unki aavashyaktaaon kii purti kii ja sake
 However, Surendra Kumar had spoken about the elections in the general election 2019 itself and also said that preparations should be completed on time, so a report has been asked to be given a little sooner
 lekin raajnneetik dal ise vakt se pehle chunaav karaane ke sanket maanate hai
 In fact, before the completion of the term, the stakes of the dissolution of the assembly will not allow much opportunity for the opposition parties to prepare for the election
 kesiar ho yaa phir naveen patnayak in donon netaaon ke kad ke donon main vipaksh ke paas unke baraabar kaa koi bhi netaa nahin he
 They will not have to work hard due to the assembly elections before the Lok Sabha elections and will be able to take advantage of their image in the state level elections
 aise main april tak rukate to aam chunaav ke maahaul main rajya main pradhanmantri narendra modi or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa factor haaavee ho saktaa he
 The Congress is the main opposition party there and if the party declares Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate then it may have an impact on the assembly voting during Lok Sabha voting
 yahi vajah he ki odisha or telugana ke mukhyamantri jald chunaav kaa daanv khel rahe hai
 The Chief Minister of Rajasthan, who went out on the Gaurav Yatra, has suffered a major setback from Kohaicourt
 rajasthan hoicourt ne aaj kaha kigaurav yatrake upar sarkari kharch na kiya jaae
 Government money will not be spent on ministerial officers except Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje in vehicles plying during Gaurav Yatra
 gauratlab he ki pehle congress ne rajasthan hoicourt main yachika lagaai thi ki sarkari khajaane se vasundhara raaje chunavi yatra par nikali hai or apane is yatra ke dauraan colector va espi kii madad se logon ko bula rahe hai
 Not only this, by calling the beneficiaries of the scheme, it is being explained that the BJP should vote
 congress ke yachika par sunwaayee karte hue rajasthan hoicourt ne bijepi ko or rajasthan sarkaar ko notice jari kiya tha, jiske jawaab main rajasthan kii vasundhara raaje sarkaar ne kaha tha ki bijepi rajya sarkaar kii milijuli yatra he
 The workers of the party whose government is in Rajasthan will come to the conferences and at the same time if the government is communicating with the people for the benefit of its plan, then they will also come
 is par sunwaayee karte hue rajasthan hoicourt ne faisla surakshit rakhaa tha
 Judge GR Moolchandani of Rajasthan High Court has ruled in this matter today and said that government expenditure should not be on electoral journey i

 On Friday, the body of a 40-year-old young man Chetan Saini, on the hills of Nahargarh in Jaipur, was found hanging from the fort of the fort on the hill

 In many places it was also written that the Kafir should be sent to Allah

 wo kabhi nahargarh nahin gaya or guuruuvaar shaam saadhe paanch baje tak parivaar ke saath tha, lekin raat ke baad kai baar phone karne par bhi usne phone nahin uthaaya
 The question is that if Chetan committed suicide then why did he want to spoil the communal atmosphere of the city

 'send the Kafirs to Allah' and 'we do not just hang the effigies of Padmavati

 com / sgkym4qzzs Prime Minister Manmohan Singh criticized the opposition for misleading publicity about the policy initiatives of the United Progressive Alliance government and said that various policies of the government including Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail sector will benefit the common man and create employment opportunities
 Will increase
 ramlila maidan main congress party dwaara yojit raily ko sambodhit karte hue manmohan ne kaha ki upie sarkaar or congress party donon hi samrudh bharat banane ke liye patibaddh hai, lekin is lakshya ko paane ke liye logon ko lanbaa rasta tay karnaa hoga
 He said, if we want to bring some changes in our policies for the benefit of the country, we will definitely do so
 tippaniyan Defending the decision to allow foreign investment in multi-brand retail, the Prime Minister said that it is completely wrong to say that this will harm farmers

 This problem is around 8 pm Indian time
 30 baje se shuru hui
 But after about 9 hours this problem is fixed
 fasebuk ne twit karke kaha he ki kuch logon ko video, pikchar filein bhejne main pareshaani hui
 Facebook apologized for the trouble caused to its users and said that we are back 100 percent, we are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you

 Some users on Twitter are also suspecting that Russia and China have cyber-attacked the American company Facebook
 whatsapp main koi yugers kisi ko photo send nahin kar paa rahe hai or na hi koi photo Status main lag rahi he
 Facebook, Messenger, whatsapp and Insta have not had problems for the first time, but this time there is a problem in photos
 photose kii jagah photo nahin dikh rahi he, balki us photo kii ditels dikh rahi he
 Like who's doing what in that photo
 yahaan tak ki us photo main koi shaks hans rahaa he yaa baaten kar rahaa he, is tarah kii bhi ditels mil rahi hai
 Facebook and whatsapp have billions of users worldwide
 twitor par log badi hekking yaa data li kii ashanka laga rahe hai
 Since Facebook is already under constant scrutiny since the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, people's fears are also legitimate
 twitor par kuch yugers kaa kahana he ki ye sib war kii vajah se ho rahaa he, to kuch kaa kahana he ki fasebuk main koi bada data li hone vaala he
 Some screenshots are really surprising
 fasebuk ke alaava twitor ne bhi kuch samay pehle ek twit kiya he
 The tweet by Twitter support says that the company is working to fix the problem coming in the direct message

 What did Facebook say? Facebook says that the company knows about the issue and it will be rectified as soon as possible
 company ne twitor par massenger, fasebuk or watsap ke twitor handle se twit karke yahi baat kahi he

 Increase security or else strike: Dheeraj Singh, president of the indefatigable doctors association, a patient was attacked by a patient accusing the doctor of delaying his treatment
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii ghatnaayen hamaare liye nai nahin hai
 Such incidents keep happening
 agar ham dar-dar ke kaam karenge to marij kaa ilaaj kaise karenge
 He said that our security should be increased to investigate such attacks
 unhone kaha ki aspataal prashasan kaa kaam he ki behatar sicurity de taaki nidar hokar kaam kiya ja sake
 If this does not happen, this strike is uncertain

 According to the November data of State Bank of India, the total amount paid using debit cards and credit cards has fallen by 31% in November

 This drop in shopping at the point of sale has not reached a month low

 According to the new data, till 13 December 2016, the purchases on POS were weak and in these 13 days, only Rs 18,130 crore was purchased

 Mobile payments are just a compulsion
 If there has been a 31 per cent decline in payments from debit and credit cards after the demonetisation in November, the fact is that during this time these cards have been used to withdraw cash from atms
 haalanki abhi rigerv bank ne november or disambar kaa atm se cash nikasi kaa vaastavik aankada jari nahin kiya he
 Economic Affairs Expert Anshuman Tiwari, editor of India Today, believes that by the first week of January, these figures will show that the number of cash withdrawals from debit cards and credit cards has been recorded many times more
 anshuman tiwari ke mutabik notebandi ke dauraan november main mobile pement main lagbhag 10 fisadi kaa ijapha dekhne ko mila he
 However, this cannot be compared to the 31 per cent drop in POS transactions
 unke mutabik mobile pement main is ijaphe kaa saaf matlab he ki cash kii kami ke chalate kuch logon ne mobile pement kaa sahaara liya, jabaki zyaadaatar logon ko abhi bhi cash par bharosa he lihaaja unhone credit or debit card kii madad se atm vidroval par zyada jor diya
 With weak and scattered opposition and strong allies like Sharad Pawar, Sonia Gandhi's own shine remained
 sonia gandhi ne bhartiya dakshinpanth ke malbe par congress ko satta karne vaali swaabhaavik party ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 Now they need a strong foundation
 kaayam he sonia kaa aabhamandal" "lagata he dhwani vigyaan bhi sonia gandhi kii raajnneeti ke paksh main he
 Is this a boom? Or his rise, which is also neutralizing the gravitational pressure of the fraudulent politics of the coalition? Or is it the charisma that does not fade? Despite a hat-trick in Maharashtra, a narrow margin victory in Haryana and huge success in Arunachal, Sonia does not drift in boom or upheaval, but rather maintains a glow in the political scene with opposition leaders on the verge of becoming fossils
 pichley do aam chunaavon main jeet ke baad bharat kii sabase puraani party kii mukhiya banane kaa unka aabhamandal kaayam he
 It is the victory of a skilled strategist and also of a leader who knows the boundaries of his area of influence and values political partnership
 unhone gati banaae rakhi he
 The more realistic it turned out, Soniyama could have comfortably lost the election in Maharashtra if she had fallen into fantasies
 centre main apane mahatvapurn saathi or rakanpa netaa sharad pavaar ko chhod ve 'ekala chalo re' kii niti par chal sakati thim
 Taking lessons from her son, she could choose to enter the election field alone but she did not do so
 ve jarurat se zyada yathartwaadee nikaleen, jinhen gathbandhan sarkaar main len-dein ke mahatv kaa ehsaas he kyonki ve is sahaj sach ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhati thim ki pavaar jaise diggaj maratha ko dushman yaa pratidwandvi banane kii jagah unke saath chalanaa behatar hoga
 Under his guidance, the Congress did not take the electoral path that was adopted in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 usne jaanche-parakhe-haalanki unhen ekadam bharosemand nahin kaha ja saktaa-sahyogi ke saath bane rahane kaa faisla kiya
 It was a trio of Sonia, Pawar and Chief Minister Ashok Chavan who wrote a victory in Maharashtra
 in teenon ko gathbandhan kii takat main puraa bharosa tha
 And see how it worked
 bhartiya loktantr menvikalp kii baari kamiisake baavjood congress ko teenon rajyon main jeet dohraane ke liye adhik mehnat nahin kerani padi
 Its victory in Haryana may have been by a small margin, it reflects the growing void in Indian democracy - the acute shortage of alternatives
 bikharaa or asangithat vipaksh apni jagah bhi khota ja rahaa he or koi tark karne kii sthiti main bhi vah nahin he
 The story in the South camp itself is a story of the leadership's disease
 apni umr ke chalate raajnneeti se avkaash lene vaale atal bihari vaajapeyi ke baad bhaajapa ke paas aisa netaa nahin he jo kaaryakartaaon main prerana kaa sanchaar kar sake, sahyogi dalon ko baandhakar rakhe or apane tark manavaa sake
 LK Advani, the party's so-called most powerful leader, is not willing to accept his futility
 ve aise vichaar ke fossil ban jane ke pratik hai, jisane kabhi bhartiya janamanas ko apni ore jhukaa diya tha
 If Vajpayee had leadership, the story of Maharashtra and Haryana would have been different
 bhagava kheme main koi sarvamaanya netaa hota to shivasena ke paariwarik jhagade rajnatik drushti se itane aatmghaatee na ban pate
 Now this house is burning
 haryana main bhi bhaajapa main aisa koi netaa nahin tha jo om prakaash chautaala ko chunavi saathi banaae rakhata
 Despite Sonia's luster, opposition to Congressism is not over
 ab bhi mayawati, nitish kumaar or mulaayam singh yadav jaise kshetreey brands hindibhashi rajyon main maujuud hai
 If there is something missing in Indian politics, then such a leader can unite the anti-congress forces
 maharashtra or haryana ke nattejey isi sachaai ko pratisthapit karte hai
 The opposition may have rejected the nationalist leaders, but the truth is that it does not have a single national leader
 sonia ne kiya virodhiyon kaa acha upyogsonia gandhi ne apane sabase katu virodhiyon kaa sabase acha upyog kiya he
 She is becoming the leader of coalition politics, despite Rahul Gandhi's single-handed experiment of walking alone in Hindi-speaking states
 nai shrimati gandhi kshetreey taqatvar netritv ko protsaahit karti hai-maharashtra main ashok chavaan ko or haryana main bhupinder singh hooda ko
 That is, such leaders who also win the party and are qualified administrators
 yahi nahin, ve paramparaagat congress virdohi voton ko baantne yaa unhen phir dharmanirpekshata ke naam par apane hit main bhunaane main lagaataar safal ho rahi hai
 This is the reason why he is not afraid of Mayawati or Mulayam Singh Yadav
 in donon ke man main congress ke liye koi prem bhav nahin he lekin ve dharmanirpekshata kii unki paribhaasha kii jarur kadra karte hai
 And in an India where dissatisfaction is expressed in raucous and melodious notes, Sonia - as one of her young mps says - maintains complacency
 congress ko mila desh ke vikhandit vipaksh kaa phaaydato kya ham kabhi na haarane vaali sonia ke daur main aa gaye hai? ve jeet rahi hai, lekin unhone koi badi jeet darj nahin kii he
 They have not been able to repeat a Lok Sabha victory in Maharashtra or Haryana
 andhra pradesh, rajasthan yaa dilli ke alaava kisi bade rajya main congress satta main nahin he
 India's most successful and powerful leader is yet to get India's uninterrupted mandate
 bhartiya dakshinpanth ke malbe se unhone congress ko bharat kii shashan karne vaali swaabhaavik party ke rup main punah sthapit kiya he
 Sonia Gandhi needs a more robust foundation to return to the original form of the Congress: it should be a huge banyan tree that nurtures national and regional expectations of all colors
 desh ke vikhandit vipaksh unhen jo uphaar main de saktaa he, sonia ko usase kahin adhik kii jarurat he
 a week after the terror attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, Maulana Masood Azhar, the kingpin of jaish-e-mohammed, has released a new audio
 taaja audio main masood ajahar ne pulavama hamale main kisi tarah kaa haath hone se inkaar kiya he, yahaan tak kii usne daawa kiya he ki vah kabhi aatanki adil ahamed daar se nahin mila tha
 In this audio, he also described the Pakistani government and the media as cowards
 isse pehle hamale ke baad jaish ne isaki jimmedaari lee thi, lekin ab vah mukarta dikh rahaa he
 In this audio released on Thursday, Masood Azhar said that the Pulwama attack would cause loss to the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 usne ye bhi kaha ki vah pakistan ko kisi tarah kii jang main nahin dhakelnaa chahta he
 It is also said in the audio that China will always support Pakistan, so there is no need to panic
 usne kaha ki narendra modi kashmir main puri tarah fail ho gaye hai
 After the Pulwama terror attack, the government of Pakistan, which was surrounded by the world, was called a coward by Masood Azhar, he said that both the media and the government here are scared
 apane is audio main masood ajahar ne adil ahamed daar kaa bhi naam liya
 Let us tell you that Adil had carried out a suicide attack in Pulwama and got into the CRPF convoy with his car
 audio main masood ajahar bolaa, ‘’ jitani gaali deni he de do mujhe, lekin adil ahamed ke khilaaf kuch naa kahana, kashmir main aazaadee kii ladaai apane pairon par khadi ho chuki he
 There is no need for any foreign power
 ’’usne is audio main adil se kisi tarah kaa sambandh hone se bhi nakaara, usne kaha ki adil ko puri duniya mere saath jod rahi he
 But i wish i had met him sometime
 agar adil kii vajah se mujhe maar diya jaae to koi gam nahin hoga, ye mere liye shahadat hogi
 In this audio, Masood Azhar also praised the Pakistani columnist Ayaz, who openly praised Adil Ahmed Dar
 usne apil kii he ki pakistani awam ko hindustan ke dabaav main nahin aana chahie
 Let us tell you that many countries like America, France, Russia have come together in the Indian campaign to ban jaish-e-mohammed's chief Masood Azhar, after which Jaish has been swayed
 aapako bataa den ki 14 farvari ko hue aatanki hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the, pehle isaki jimmedaari jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi
 But now he seems retracted
 ghatana ke baad se hi duniyabar main pakistan kii thu-thu ho rahi he, jiske baad imran khan ko safai dene aana padaa
 Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said in his statement that if there is any evidence, he is ready to take action
 gauratlab he ki jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana masood ajahar pichley kai saal se pakistan ko hi apana adda banaae hue he
 The Jaish terrorists who carried out the Pulwama attack have been killed by the Indian security forces in an encounter in Pulwama itself

 Door is, he's bills after the passage of legislators, ministers and chief minister will also be covered
