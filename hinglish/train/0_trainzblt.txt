 Then one by one the process of murder and investigation starts

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is going to rally in Kolkata on January 19 to bring opposition parties together to defeat the Narendra Modi-led BJP in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi sahit akhilesh yadav or chandrababu naidu tak ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he
 Whereas due to the Congress, Telangana Chief Minister and TRS President k Chandrasekhar Rao will not share the stage
 aise main wo shaamil nahin honge
 In fact, Telangana CM KCR is trying to form a federal front with non-congress-non-bjp parties
 haal hi main unhone pashchim bengal jaakar mamata banerjee se mulaakaat kii thi
 In such a situation, now Mamata wants to make BJP realize her strength by uniting opposition parties, then KCR is not joining it
 ise mamata ke liye jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 KCR has his own political equations behind his absence
 mamata ke manch par aise raajnneetik dal ekajute ho rahe hai, jinase kesiar kaa 36 kaa aankada he
 Congress and TDP are mainly in it
 telugana main tiares ke khilaaf congress mukhya vipakshi dal hai
 In the recently held assembly elections, the Congress, along with TDP, had contested against KCR, but it could not win
 tiares 119 sadasyeey telugana vidhansabha kii 88 siten jitkar pichley maheene phir se satta main ai or congress 19 siton ke saath duusare number par rahi
 In such a situation, KCR wants to differentiate himself from the Congress in any case
 isi vajah se mamata kii raily main shaamil na hone kii mukhya vajah maani ja rahi he
 At the same time, Odisha Chief Minister and BJD President Naveen Patnaik said at the India Today Mind Rocks program that his party's policy is clear, he is walking the same distance from BJP and Congress
 wo donon partiyon main se kisi ke saath bhi gathbandhan nahin karenge
 It is clear from Patnaik's statement that he will set his political path apart from these two alliances
 haalanki mamata banerjee loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan karke utrengi yaa nahin
 The picture is not clear on this
 iske baavjood mamata kii raily main congress ke shaamil hone kii sambhaavna maani ja rahi he
 Whereas the State Congress Committee of Bengal has been strict about Mamta
 mamata banerjee kii yah raily tamaam vipakshi partiyon ko aakarshith kar rahi he to centre kii satta par kabiz bijepi ko bhi apni taraf khinch rahi he
 BJP has to see whether this rally of Mamta helps the opposition
 abhi pashchim bengal kii 42 loksabhaa siton main se tiemasi ke paas 34 siten hai, jabaki mukhyamantri mamata banerjee is baar sabhi 42 siton par jeet hasil karne kii koshishon main lagi hai

 holikaa dahan kii lapten bahut shubhakari hoti hai
 In the fire of Holika Dahan every worry is destroyed, sorrows are destroyed and blessings are fulfilled
 buraai par achchhai kii jeet ke is parv main jitna mahatv rangon kaa he, utana hi holikaa dahan kaa bhi he
 It is believed that Holika Puja and Dahan are not delayed by legal legislation
 holikaa dahan par shubh sanyogjyotishiyon kaa kahana he ki holi par agar aap vidhi vidhaan se parikrama kar sahi prasad chadha den to khaali jholii bharte der nahin lagegi
 Because this time Holika Dahan is becoming very auspicious coincidence
 holikaa dahan phalgun maas kii poornima tithi main karnaa chahie
 On March 1, the full moon date is being observed from 8
8 am to 8 am, but Bhadra must have been associated with it
 aisa niyam he ki bhadraa kaal main holikaa dahan nahin karnaa chahie
 Bhadra will end at 7
37 pm in the evening
 iske baad se holikaa dahan kiya janaa shubh rahegaa
 For Holika Dahan, having three things together is very auspicious
 poornima tithi ho, pradosh kaal ho or bhadraa naa laga ho
 This year these three coincidences are happening on Holika Dahan, so Holi will be enjoyable
 is baar holikaa dahan kaa shubh muhoort shaam 6 bajkar 26 minute se lekar 8 bajkar 55 minute tak rahegaa
 Sun will also get the power of the moon due to the full moon, due to which if you take a decision related to business, money or education related matters between this auspicious planetary conditions, then you will surely get success
 itnaa hi nahin agar aap lambey samay se kisi beemaari se pareshaan hai yaa phir shatruon kii badhati sankhya ne aapaki chintaa badha rakhi he to is baar holikaa dahan kii lapaton main aapaki samast chintaaen jalakar khaak ho jaaengi
 According to the mythological Kathapuranas of Holika Dahan, when the demon king Hiranyakashyap saw that his son Prahlad did not worship any other God except Vishnu, he became enraged and finally ordered his sister Holika to take Prahlad in the lap and sit in the fire
 Go; Because Holika had a boon that fire cannot harm her
 kintu hua iske thik vipareet, holikaa jalakar bhasma ho gayi or bhakt prahlaad ko kuch bhi nahin hua
 In memory of this incident, there is a law to perform Holika Dahan on this day
 holi kaa parv sandesh detaa he ki isi prakaar ishwar apane anany bhakton kii raksha ke liye sadaa upasthit rahete hai
 What is the importance of Parikrama? Parikrama is considered very important in Holika Puja and Dahan
 kehete hai parikrama karte hue agar apni ichha kah di jaae to wo sach ho jaati he
 Apart from circumambulation, burning of dung cakes in Holika Dahan is also very important
 kitne upale jalaaen, kis aakaar ke upale jalaaen ye bhi aapako apni manokamana or shraddha ke hisaab se tay karnaa hoga
 Parikrama and Upela will not only make your dreams a reality, the value of offerings is also no less
 chaahe aapako sukh samruddhi kii darkaar ho yaa phir videsh yatra kerani ho, sawaal nai naukari kaa ho yaa phir santan prapti kaa aashirwad chahie, holikaa pujan se aapaki sabhi icchhaaen bhi puri ho sakati hai

 1 aktubar ko janata darbar main lagbhag 600 logon se milane ke baad unhone intjaar kar rahe patrakaron se pehali baar bachane kii koshish kii, ‘‘aaj chhod dijie
 Remained ’’ nitish ke paas baat karne ke liye kai chijen rahi hongi, lekin jaahir he, patrakaron ko unhone isliye taal diya kyonki ve apni adhikaar yatra ke dauraan rajyabar main hue apratyaashit virodh pradarshnon se jude asahaj kar dene vaale sawaalon se bachanaa chaah rahe the
 Ironically, the two and a half million school teachers who were appointed on the contract were promoted by the Nitish government in the past as their huge achievement, the same teachers made Nitish Kumar's journey a platform of protest
 ye contract shikshak masik 6,000 se 7,000 ru
 And now they are demanding equal pay to regular teachers
 sarkaar iske liye bilkul taiyaar nahin thi
 Ever since Nitish started this yatra from Bettiah on September 19 with a demand for special status to Bihar, teachers have opposed him everywhere since then
 is hamale se tilamilaakar niteesha achaanak hi ruukhaa vyavhaar karne lage hai
 His example of this annoyance was seen in Darbhanga when on September 26 he warned the protesting teachers from the stage that if the supporters of JD (U) became active, the teachers might have to pay a heavy price
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aapkaa durvyavhaar mujhe aapaki maangen maanane ke liye majaboor nahin kar saktaa
 The anger of the Chief Minister of Bihar is also not completely illegitimate
 unhen ummid he ki centre main agali sarkaar ke gathan main ve nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 So in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he can single-handedly contest all 40 seats
 patna main 4 november ko hone vaali adhikaar raily ke liye samarthan jutaney ke liye unki adhikaar yatra unki yojanaon ko saakaar karne ke liye nirnaayak ho sakati he
 Therefore, Nitish is very upset with the protesters, who covered his politically ambitious visit in the shadow of protests and turned the whole case into an administrative failure
 jaahir taur par adhikaar yatra nitish kii rajnatik bisaat kaa sidhaa sanket he
 The visit, which began a day after Mamata Banerjee withdrew support to the UPA government, gave rise to rumors that he could continue in power without the BJP
 adhikaar yatra ke dauraan unhone betia main kaha tha, ‘‘bihar ko jo bhi vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa, main use samarthan dene ko taiyaar
 However, he later clarified that his statement was made in the context of the formation of the next government in 2014
 lekin unhone abtak bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkaar ke liye sampurna samarthan kii baat nahin kii he
 Obviously, Nitish's support to the BJP is conditional
 udhar, dilli main 1 aktubar ko jedy (you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne centre sarkaar kii aarthik sudhaar sambandhi ghoshnaaon ke khilaaf hui rashtriya raily main mamata banerjee ke saath manch saajha kiya jisamen mamata ne ek sangheey morcha gathit karne kii baat kahi
 Sources within the JD (U) point out that the idea of a federal front is compatible with Nitish's 'secular agenda'
 bihar se jedy (you) ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya, ‘‘hamen lagata he ki bihar main akele chunaav ladgaye se ham loksabhaa main apni 20 saansadon kii takat ko or badha sakenge
 We can maintain an equal distance from both the Congress and the BJP, and if the mandate remains fragmented, then who knows if we will be able to form the government
 ’’sanyogvash nitish ne apni adhikaar yatra ke dauraan bihar ke un loksabhaa kshetron kaa bhi daura kiya jahaan ke saansad bijepi ke hai
 However, he has fully maintained the JD (U) agenda of the Adhikar Rally, in which coalition partners are nowhere near present
 bijepi ne bhi shaayad nitish kii niyat bhaanp lee he, tabhi haal hi main surajkund main yojit bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main bihar pradesh adhyaksh si
 P
 thakur ne saaf shabdon main bihar kii sabhi 40 loksabhaa siton par akele chunaav ladgaye kii taiyaari kii baat tak kah daali
 Says a senior BJP leader, "it may be that Thakur's statement is a political act, although it is true that we are a little shocked about Nitish's future plans
" ’’ 30 sitambar ko purniya se bijepi ke saansad udai singh ne bhi sushasan ke rajya sarkaar ke daavon kii dhajjiyaan uda deen
 In Purnia, he organized a Vedana rally in which a large crowd gathered
 usamen unhone ‘bhrasht, nakchadhi or dabang afasarshahi’ ke liye rajya prashasan ko aade haath liya
 Till now the central leadership of BJP has not taken any action against Uday Singh
 mukhyamantri is baat se tilamilaae hue hai ki adhikaar yatra ne unke sushasan ko badnaam karne kaa hi kaam kiya he
 On September 28, another incident occurred which added fuel to the fire
 jedy (you) vidhayak punam yadav ke pati or purv vidhayak ranvir yadav ne mukhyamantri kii khagadipha jile main hui jansabha ke dauraan pradarshnakariyon ko khadedgaye ke liye ek pulisavaale kii carbine chin lee or golibari kii dhamkee de daali
 So far no case has been registered against him
 saaf he ki nitish kumaar ne jitani ummiden jagaain thim, unhen ve puraa nahin kar sake hai
 The change in faith of the teachers working on the contract who used to be JD (U) voters is just one example of this
 nitish ne adhikaar yatra ke dauraan virodh pradarshan bhadakaane kaa dosha vipakshiyon ke sir madh diya he jabaki vipakshi party argedy ke pramukh lalu prasad yadav ise ‘‘sarkaar main logon ke sachche avishvaas kii abhivyakti’’ qaraar de rahe hai
 Both claims do not fully reveal the ground reality of Bihar, but one thing is certain that the recent demonstrations have removed the ghetto on Nitish's massive political campaign

 He said, 'we all worry about Jammu and Kashmir and the things happening there

 Rawat also referred to the recent murder of apple traders in the Kashmir Valley

 Katju, who was targeted by opposition parties by commenting on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, has targeted social activist Anna Hazare and his former aide and Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal
 katju ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ek aisi beemaari he jisase agle 20 varsh tak nijaat paanaa mumkin nahin he
 In a conversation with a private TV channel, Katju said, "ninety percent of Indians vote like sheep
 log jaanwaron ke jhund kii tarah bina soche-samajhe jati va dharm ke aadhaar par matdaan karte hai
 "he said," Due to the support of Indian voters, many criminals are in Parliament
 " The former Supreme Court judge said that he would not vote because some leaders are running the country who are elected because of their caste
 yah loktantr kaa asli rup nahin he
 He said, "I don't vote because my vote is meaningless
" matdaan jat, muslim, yadav yaa anusuchit jati ke naam par hota he
 Democracy is not the name of this way

 There is no moral code in the country, so corruption cannot be eradicated completely
 " The former judge has been accused of being eager to get publicity, but he said, "getting publicity is a form of perversion

 " sarvocch nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish ne kaha ki vah matdaan nahin karenge kyonki desh ko kuch aise netaa chalaa rahe hai jo apni jati ke kaaran chune jate hai
 This is not a real form of democracy

 is tarah se chalane kaa naam loktantr nahin he
 Why should i waste my time standing in the queue of animals? " apane dharmanirpeksh vichaaron par abhimaan karte hue katju ne kaha ki vah sampradayik shaktiyon ke khilaaf hai
 They said, "
 
 And if i am declared a Congressman for being secular, then you are allowed to follow your own viewpoint
 " In recent times, Katju has been in the limelight for seeking forgiveness for Sanjay Dutt and Jebunnisa Kazi, who were convicted by the Supreme Court in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case

 jairam thakur ke rup main himachal pradesh ko chatha aisa netaa mila he jisane mukhyamantri kii kaman sanbhali
 He is the 13th state leader and the third Chief Minister from the Bharatiya Janata Party
 badhai ke ghar se taalluk rakhane vaale jairam mandi ke chachot seat phir siraaj (punarsimakan ke baad nayaa naam mila) se 5veen baar chunaav jitkar vidhansabha pahunche hai
 He has a close association with the Rashtriya Sevak Sangh (RSS) and ABVP, now he has become the new head of the state
 lagaataar paanchavin baar jeet hasil karne ke baad mukhyamantri ke pad par pahunchane vaale mridubhashi or karmath jairam ne ab kaman to sambhaal liya he, lekin pad grahan karte hi unhen kai chunautiyon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 He has succeeded in the responsibility he got in the political journey so far, but whether he will succeed as chief minister also, only time will tell
 lekin shuruaati charan main unke saamne ye 7 badi chunautiyaan hongi
 To justify modi-shah's decision, after 2014, in every state in which BJP has come to power, the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah has gone, that is, he has given the command to the people of his choice
 himachal pradesh main bhi modi-shah kii jodi ne kai bade naamon ko peeche chhodte hue jairam thakur ko mukhyamantri chunaa he
 In such a situation, the biggest challenge for Jayaram will be to achieve success as a chief minister and modi-shah's choice will have to be proved right by running a stable government in the state
 naaraaz guton ko saadhe rakhanachunaav parinaam aane se pehle bhaajapa ne prem kumaar dhumal ko party kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tha, lekin dhumal ke chunaav haar jane se baaji palat gai or unhen is res se baahar hona padaa
 After this, apart from Dhumal, Union Ministers JP Nadda, Suresh Bhardwaj and Narendra Baragata were also being named as future Chief Ministers, but after several days of speculation, Jayaram beat all others
 vah umradraj netaaon main kaaphi junior maane jate hai
 Anyway, in this small state, there are many factions (dhumal faction and Nadda faction) in the party who may try to trouble the new government somewhere
 aise kisi bhi prayaas ko hakeekat main badalane se rokna bhi jairam kii agali badi chunauti hogi
 They have to keep pace with senior leaders and take everyone along
 53 hajaar karod kaa karjanai sarkaar banane par bhaajapa pradesh kii ikai main philhal jashn kaa maahaul hoga, lekin iske baad sarkaar ko baari bharkam karj ke saath apni pari khelni hogi
 There is a debt of about 53 thousand crore rupees on the state, which along with repaying it, is another big challenge for this new government
 pradesh main vittiya sthiti hi sankatpurna nahin balki prashasnic dhaancha bhi gadabadaya hua he
 On the basis of bad law and order map, Himachal is counted in small states, but like other states here too have their own problems
 nechar ke hisaab se yah behad shant rajya bhi he, lekin pichley kuch saalon main kanoon-vyavastha bigadi he
 The number of crime has increased rapidly
 gudiya rape or hatya, hoshiyaar singh prakaran ne rajya ko khaasaa badnaam bhi kiya
 The BJP itself has been blaming the previous Congress government for poor law and order and made it a big issue in the elections
 ab jab yahaan bhaajapa kii sarkaar aa gai he to badhate aparaadh par ankush lagane kii jimmedaari us par hogi
 Challenge to overcome unemployment: BJP announced 4-9-14 in its election manifesto, eradicate unemployment, make Himachal corruption free, as well as policy for outsourced employees, pension scheme for government departments, corporation boards and pension scheme The committee promised to set up
 ab is nai sarkaar ko apane in vaadon ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Doubling the compensation of agricultural land will be the next big challenge with the government of Jairam Thakur to increase the amount of agricultural land to be acquired from the farmers from 2 to 4 times
 saath hi tractor or pikup ko krishi rin yojana main shaamil karnaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 Everyone has their own house, according to the promise of the central government, everyone should have their own house promise by 2022
 apana ghar yojana ke tahat pradesh ke har parivaar ke liye makaan kii vyavastha karnaa behad mushkil hoga
 That too when the state is burdened with debt, though the good thing is that its party has a government at the center
 petrol dijal kii khapat main giravat kii vajah se tex vasuuli main hone vaali kami ke liye sarkaar bhale hi taiyaar ho, lekin ab iskaa asar petrol panpon ke kaarobaar par bhi dikh saktaa he or choubison ghante jaagane vaali dilli ko apni duusari aadaten bhi badalani pad sakati hai
 After the appointment of the Congress President in the neighboring state of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh is also witnessing a new president
 party yahaan sarvamaanya netaa kii talash main he, jo sabhi guton ke bich samanvay sthapit kar sake
 The party is exploring possibilities among tribal and backward class leaders associated with the youth
 congress sutron kaa kahana he ki najdiki rajya chhattisgarh main adivasee netaa mohan markaam ko party kaa pradesh adhyaksh bana diya gaya he, or ab party madhya pradesh main bhi kisi adivasee yaa pichhadaa varg ke netaa ko talash rahi he
 Actually, these two sections of the state supported the Congress in the assembly elections
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main jin vidhansabha kshetron main congress ko badhat mili, unamem adhikansh adivasee varg ke liye arakshit vidhansabha siten hai
 After the success in the state assembly elections, state president Kamal Nath took the chair of the chief minister's post and after that he had offered to resign from the post of president, but party president Rahul Gandhi asked him to continue on this responsibility till the Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko madhya pradesh main 29 main se sirf ek seat mili
 The Congress also had similar results in the country
 rajya sarkaar main mantri kamaleshwar patel congress kii haar ke liye sabhi mantriyon or netaaon ko jimmedaar maan rahe hai
 At the same time, another minister Umang Sighar wants a president in the state who can take everyone along
 baharhaal, pradesh congress main nae adhyaksh ke sambhavit chehron main adivasee netaaon main bala bachchan or umang sighar ke naam kii charchaa he, to duusari ore pichhadaa varg se kamaleshwar patel or purv pradesh adhyaksh arun yadav ko daud main mana ja rahaa he
 These four are leaders who have no direct differences with other party leaders and are leaders of the second line
 lihaaja inhen party ke diggaj netaaon mukhyamantri kamalnath, purv mukhyamantri digvijay sih or purv kendriya mantri jyotiraditya sidhiya se samanvay banane main zyada dikkat nahin aegi, party kaa aisa maananaa he
 Political analyst Sauzi Thomas says that "there is disappointment among activists since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, which is why the party is considering handing over the reins of power to an energetic young leader
" isamen rajya ke jaateey ganit par bhi dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Therefore, the party may consider making a tribal or backward class leader
 "rajya main lagbhag chah maah purv hue vidhansabha chunaav main 230 siton main se 114 par congress, 109 par bhaajapa, do par basapa or ek par sapa ne jeet darj kii thi

 kashmir ek dukhati hui kahani kaa naam he- ek udhaas sundarataa kaa afasaana jo na jane kab se banduukon ke saaye main bahati bojhil hawa main saans lene ko majaboor he
 This sadness sometimes turns into such a fierce anger that looks bent on burning everything, destroying everything, she throws stones at everyone, vows to take blood for revenge, but ultimately Finds that Vashhat has made him ill, Nafrat has made him a separatist, politics has given him the smell of gunpowder and military boots
 ye kashmir ek haanfata hua kashmir he jise apano se beyimaani kii or zulm kii shikaayat he
 It is a scared Kashmir that looks out for relief and hopes that some help will come from across the border
 ye ek zakhmi kashmir he jise asal main maraham chahie, apanepan kaa bharosa chahie, azaadi kaa vah ehsaas chahie jo uske liye mahaj ek naaraa ban gaya he
 In this Kashmir, everyone is engaged in business from panic to politics, but he is not bringing medicines so that his suffering body will be lessened
 afaspa naam kaa jo nashtar ham kashmir kii jarrahi ke liye barason se istemaal kar rahe hai, usne ilaaj kam die hai, badan main ghaav zyada kiye hai- ye ehsaas bhi sabko he
 The comments magar aise nashtar istemaal karnaa jitna aasaan hota he, unhen baahar nikaalnaa utana hi mushkil
 This is also the problem of Kashmir
 lekin is mushkil ke paar paane kaa rasta bhi hamen hi nikaalnaa hoga or kuch is tarah nikaalnaa hoga ki hamaara jamhuriyat kaa iqbaal buland ho, usamen kashmir kaa bharosa laute
 His dry eyes could deceive some in the hope of friendship
 philhal to apane-aap se or apano se jujhate kashmir ke liye ye baat kisi utapia se kam nahin, lekin aise utapia par ham yaqiin karen- yah kashmir ke bhavishya ke liye zaruri he

 This Kashmir is a gasping Kashmir, which complains of dishonesty and persecution from its own
 ye ek daraa hua kashmir he jo raahat ke liye baahar dekhtaa he or ummid karata he ki sarhad paar se koi madad chali aegi
 It is a wounded Kashmir that really needs ointment, needs trust in belonging, a sense of freedom which has become just a slogan for it
 is kashmir main har koi dehshat se lekar siyasat tak ke kaarobaar main laga he, lekin wo dawa nahin laa rahaa jisase uske tisate badan kii takaleef kuch kam ho
 The slogan named Afspa, which we have been using for years in Kashmir, has given less treatment, has more wounds in the body - this is also realized by everyone
 tippaniyan But the easier it is to use such dancers, the more difficult it is to get them out
 kashmir kii mushkil bhi yahi he
 But we will also have to find a way to overcome this difficulty and find something in such a way that our solidarity is high, return the trust of Kashmir in it
 uski sukhi hui ankhen dosti kii aas main kuch chhalchala saken
 At the moment, this is no less than a utopia for Kashmir battling with itself and its own people, but let us believe in such a utopia - it is necessary for the future of Kashmir

 Your lifeless skin can reduce the fun of your festivals
 isliye isse mukti paane ke liye rojaanaa apniskinpar moshcharizer jarur lagaaein
 Also, avoid washing your face again and again, because by doing this, the skin becomes dry

 Use cold water - It would be strange to hear that cold water is used in winter

 mechap kam karen-aadhiktar mahilaayein tyoharon ke samay alag dikhne ke liye jarurat se zyada mechap kaa istemaal karti hai
 Applying more makeup on the face reduces the glow of the face

 5
 sanscreen kaa istemaal karen-kai logon ko lagata he ki sanscreen kaa istemaal kevalgarmike mausam main hi kiya jaataa he

 ji haa, kyonki sanscreen garmi kii dhoop ke saath-saath sardi kii dhoop se bhi skin ko surakshit rakhata he
 Therefore, in the winter season, before using the sunscreen must be used

 On Thursday, the cabinet has agreed to abolish the Delhi Rent Control Act
 bijepi dilli rent control act kaa lagaataar virodh karti rahi he, jaahir he ki ye bijepi ke vot bank main send lagane kii koshish he
 The decision of the Cabinet is no less than good news for the businessmen in Delhi who are running the business from the rental shops
 1995 main bana dilli rent control act tabhi se thande baste main padaa tha jabaki ise sansad ne paas kar diya tha or raashtrapati This too was approved, but the government could not issue a notification due to the protest
 shahari vikaas mantralay ke sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki mantri kamalnath maanate the ki 1995 kaa kanoon purana he or is dauraan aarthik or saamaajik badlaav aae hai
 In view of them, a new law is needed
 tippaniyan The ministry wants the new law to be of benefit to both landlord and tenant
 mantralay kaa maananaa he ki 1958 ke puraane kanoon kii vajah se sampattiyon kii haalat bahut kharaab ho chuki he kyonki na makaan maalik inaki marammat karwaata he or na hi kiraayedaar

 chunaavon se pehle hajaaron logon ko raahat chunaav main kuch bhi gul khilaa sakati he
 Now the government has decided to remove it too
 bahaanaa nayaa kanoon banane kaa he

 unako dekhte hue nae kanoon kii jarurat he
 The comments mantralay chahta he ki nayaa kanoon makaan maalik or kiraayedaar donon ke liye phaayde kaa hona chahie
 The Ministry believes that the condition of the properties has deteriorated due to the old law of 1958 as neither the landlord repairs them nor does the tenant
 november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle dilli rent control act ko khatm karke sarkaar ne un hajaaron kiraayedaaron ko raahat pahunchane kii koshish kii he jinako hameshaa kiraaya badhane kaa dar khaataa rahata tha

 adaalat ne un disha-nirdeshon ko yaad kiya, jisamen sarkari karmchaaree or nijee vyaktiyon kii giraftaar ke liye purv manjuuri di gai thi
 The court emphasized the need for a preliminary inquiry before filing an FIR

 Irradiation centers of Bhabha Atomic Research Center have started reaching fresh mangoes from several states including Gujarat
 bharat se america or australia aam ko export karne ke liye in kendron se aam kaa guzarana jaruri hota he
 These mangoes are only able to be eaten abroad after testing at these irradiation centers
 lekin is saal jahaan aam kii paidaavaar ko lekar kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki america ko kiye jane vaale aam ke export main 40 fisadi tak ijapha dekhne ko milegaa vahiin beete ek hafte ke dauraan desh kii ahm aam mandiyon main aam kii aavak pahunchane se ab kayaas palat rahaa he
 This year there will be a big fall in mango yield in the country
 aisa isliye ki gujarat or or karnataka main bheeshan garmi or disambar ke dauraan aae tufaan okhi ne aam ke pedo ko baari nuksaan puhanchaya tha
 After this, due to the changes in the weather of North India, there is a question on the yield of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh
 gujarat main aadhi rahegi aam kii paidaavaar?gujarat sarkaar ke ek shuruaati survey se pataa chalaa he ki rajya ke junagarh or gir-somnath ilaakon main pehle disambar ke dauraan aae okhi tufaan or phir march-april ke dauraan garmi ke prakope se aam kii fasal ke liye mausam kharaab rahaa he
 Due to this adverse weather, mango production in Gujarat is expected to be around half
 vahiin yah haal ke varshon main aam kii paidaavaar ko hone vaale nuksaan kaa yah sabase bada akalan he
 Due to this, the common traders fear that this year there will be a big decline in the mango exporting America
 ise padhein: trade war: tisare vishwa yuddh ke liye taiyaar china kar saktaa he america par ye hamalaa bhikendriya krishi mantri purshottam rupala ne bhi is baat ko maanate hue kaha he ki abhi gujarat sarkaar aam kii paidaavaar ko hone vaale nuksaan or usase kisaanon ko pahunchane vaale nuksaan kaa aankalan kar rahi he
 According to an initial survey by the Gujarat government, the entire Saurashtra region will see a 40-45% drop in mangoes due to inclement weather
 vahiin gujarat sarkaar ke krishi mantri ne is survey ke aadhaar par mana he ki kharaab mausam ke chalate junagarh ilaake main 50 se 55 fisadi or gir somnath jile main 55 se 60 fisadi kii giravat aam kii paidaavaar main darj hogi
 Significantly, Gujarat is the fifth largest mango producing state in the country
 aam utpaadak rajyon main sheersh par uttar pradesh ke alaava andhra pradesh, karnataka or telugana hai
 Junagadh and Gir Somnath Saffron in Gujarat are famous for mangoes
 is saal jahaan junagarh main lagbhag 8,500 hectare main aam ke baag hai vahiin, gir somnath main 15,500 hectare main aam ke baag maujuud hai
 Alphonso is famous in Valsad, Navsari and Surat districts of South Gujarat
 in donon aam kii kismon ke alaava bharat se america bheje jane vaale aamon main uttar pradesh kaa dashahari aam ahm he
 Khammam district of Telangana, which is famous for delivering the first mangoes to the capital of Delhi, the first mandate of the weather in Telangana, has suffered the weather this time
 telugana ke is jile main lagbhag 43,000 acre main aam ke baag maujuud hai
 Last year, the district, which delivered the first mangoes in the country's capital Delhi and America, did a record breaking production of about 70,000 tonnes of mangoes
 telugana ke is jile main aam kii aavak ke liye penublli, vemsoor or sathupalli mandal behad ahm hai
 Read this: The trade deficit from China is bringing the US and India together? The mango orchards in Khammam suffered major losses due to inclement weather and inclement weather rains during march-april this year
 is be-mausam barish main pedo par laden aadhe se adhik aam gir gaye or kisaanon ke saamne is saal apni laagat nikaalane kaa sawaal khadaa ho gaya he
 Along with this, this district, which brought the first mango to the capital Delhi with the record arrival, has disappointed lovers of mangoes
 feekaa padaa banganapalli kaa swadandhrapradesh se aane vaala banganapalli kism kaa aam desh or duniya main apane swaad ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This mango is also one of the first varieties in the market during the mango season
 lekin is saal is banganapalli aam ne bhi logon ko niraash kiya he
 According to the Department of Agriculture of Andhra Pradesh, unseasonal rains caused the mangoes on the trees to fall prematurely this year
 iske chalate banganapalli kii aavak bhi bazaar main ghat kar aadhi rah gai he
 The first arrival of this mango has started in the market but due to high demand and less supply, the price of Banganapalli has skyrocketed
 krishi vibhaag ke aankadon ko mutabik jahaan saamaanya taur par is aam kii aavak 16 se 18 lakh ton tak rahati he is baar kharaab mausam ke chalate mahaj 8 se 10 lakh ton aam hi bazaar pahunch paaegaa
 Significantly, this mango is also in great demand in North India as well as in America and Australia
 vahiin kuch kaarobaariyon kaa yah bhi daawa he ki is saal aam ke pedo par mausam kii maar ke chalate swaad par bhi asar padaa he
 Danger hovering over Uttar Pradesh's Dussehra? The weather is not normal in North India since last one week
 beete hafte uttar pradesh ke kai ilaakon main aae tej tufaan ne malihabad ke dashahari aamon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 On the other hand, the Meteorological Department believes that the next few days are important in terms of pre-monsoon disturbances and strong winds and thunderstorms are expected in many states including Uttar Pradesh
 gauratlab he ki is samay uttar pradesh kaa khaas dashahari aam pedo par ladaa he
 At the same time, due to the warning of the Meteorological Department and the changing mood of the weather, farmers are afraid of breaking mangoes on the trees
 haalanki rajya sarkaar ne philhal aam kii aavak par kisi tarah ke khatre kii baat nahin kahi he lekin sambhaavna he ki yahaan bhi aamon par mausam kaa asar pad saktaa he

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has indirectly targeted politicians who reacted by tweeting
 unka maananaa he twit karne vaale subah se chi chi che che karne lagate he
 The meaning of the tweet is to mean chee chee
 unhone kaha ki 'iskaa arth shabdkosh main yahi he jo chidiyon ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 But some leaders start saying 15-20 words in the morning
 media ke liye bayaan dene ke alaava unako dinabhar or koi kaam hi nahin he
 Twitter is for actors who cannot directly access their fans, not politicians
 unhen to logon ke saath sidhaa sampark bananaa chahie
 'nitish Kumar said that nature has made a beautiful thing
 chidiyon kii chah chahane se paryaavaran shuddh or santulit hota he
 But the tweeters are trying to change his language and nature
 unki chah chahaahat ko chin lenaa chaahate hai
 Actually, Nitish Kumar is not in favor of it, so he is not against it, but he has started having problems with tweeters especially after separating from BJP
 unke saath sarkaar main upmukhyamantri rahe susheel kumaar modi bhi sarkaar se hatane ke baad twit karne lage he
 That is, Sushil Kumar Modi, who has always been a media lover, used to run away from journalists as long as he was in the government, as if he had seen the ghost, but now he starts twittering in the morning which bothers Nitish Kumar
 haal hi aatanki yaccin bhatkal kii giraftaar ke baad susheel kumaar modi ne twit kiya ki vot bank kii vajah se bihar police yasin bhatkal kii giraftaar kaa shrey nahin lenaa chaahati he

 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne susheel modi ko aade haathon lete huye kaha ki ab log gaali galouj par utar aaye hai
 What is not known, they comment on it
 unhone kaha ki bihar police kaam karti he shrey lene ke chakkar main nahi rahati he
 And such comments from the opposition affect the functioning of the police

 kumaar ne yah bhi bataaya ki sarkaar ne teen sadasyeey ek samiti kaa bhi gathan kiya he, jiske sadasyon main ucchtam nyaayalay ke purv pradhan nyaayadhish jees verma sadsy ek honge
 This committee will look into the possibility of making stringent punishment provisions under the rape law
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki is ghatana main twarit rkaarwai ke liye ucch nyaayalay ke varisht adhivaktaa dayaa krishnan vishesh abhiyojak honge or yah sunishchit kiya jayega ki mukadmaa bahut kam samay main apane nishkarsh tak pahunch jaae
 When asked about no action being taken against the policemen responsible for protecting the victim, Kumar said, "an inquiry commission is being set up under a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 ’kumaar ne bataaya, ‘purv pradhan nyaayadhish is puure prakaran ke tahat is bare main chaanbin karegein ki yah cheez kyon hui or ise kyon nahin roka ja sakaa tathaa mahilaon kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye dilli evam desh ke anya hisson main kya kadam uthaaye jane chahie
 It will also be investigated whether a mistake has been made or not
 ’ unhone balaatkaar ke maamalon main sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiye jane ke bare main kaha ki is samiti ke sadasyon main nyaayamurti lalita seth or purv solisitor general gopal subramanyam bhi shaamil hai
 Kumar said, "within a very short period, they will investigate the possibility of provision of strict punishment under the rape law
" ’ yuvakon ke samooh kii teesri maang (twarit karrwai) ke bare main unhone kaha ki adhivaktaa krishnan ne vishesh abhiyojak ke rup main swechha se aane kii baat kahi or is maamle main vah rojaanaa aadhaar par mukademe kii kaarywahi main shaamil honge tathaa sunishchit karenge ki mukadmaa bahut kam samay main nishkarsh tak pahunch jaae
 He told that all the main demands of common people are being accepted, hence we are appealing for peace
 kumaar ne kaha ki sarkaar ne pradarshnakariyon kii sari maang maan lee hai or yadi ve apana pradarshan jari rakhana chaahate hai, to yah shantipurna hona chahie
 Delhi Police appealed for peace by holding the 'miscreants' responsible for the violence during the protest
 police ne kaha ki updravi tatwon ne shantipurna pradarshan kii kaman apane haathon main le lee he
 Kumar said that many types of miscreants have joined the demonstration, who want to take various benefits from the violence
 ham nahin samaj paa rahe ki jab maange maan lee gai hai phir yah hinsa kyon ho rahi he
 There is uneasiness within the Congress after a big defeat in UP
 do din khamosh rahane ke baad media se mukhaatib hue rahul gandhi khud sanghathan main badlaav kii baat kar rahe hai
 Taking charge of the loss in the Odisha Panchayat elections, the general secretary in charge BK Hariprasad has resigned
 sandip dikshit or satyavrath chaturvedi sareekhe netaa sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is a discussion in the party at every level that, where did we forget in UP? In the initial discussion, these 7 big reasons have been revealed
 
 
 1
 There was a strong anti-incumbency against the Samajwadi Party
 2
 There was also an anti-yadav atmosphere against the SP, be it recruitments, contractualities or appointments
 yadavon ko tarjeeh milane se baakiyon main naaraazgi thi
 3
 vikaas sirf lakhanu tak simit tha, agra lakhanu express ve or state haive ko hi sirf janata ne vikaas nahin mana
 In the fields of education, health, employment, industry, the Akhilesh government could not do anything special
 4
 The BSP was already betting on the dalit-muslim alliance by beating the drums of 101 Muslim candidates, then there was a message that SP, Congress alliances have been formed to collect Muslim votes and yadav-muslim alliance
 jisase non yadav or hindu matadaata ikattha ho gaya
 5
 punjab main hit rahe, lekin upi main ranneetikaar prashanth kishor flop ho gaye
 His alliance with the SP was wrong
 gathbandhan bhi aakhri vaqt main hua
 At the lower level, the activists were not connected among themselves, but the non-yadav, upper caste and the angry votes of the Congress could get the Congress
 aakhri tak kareeb ek darjan siton par sapa or congress ke ummidavaar aamane saamne lard rahe the
 6
 ranneetikaron ko ummid thi ki pashchimi upi main jat vot ajit singh kaat lenge, jiskaa bijepi ko nuksaan hoga
 That is why RLD was left alone, but the stakes backfired
 7
 The road show to be held in Benares on February 11, the day of the voting, was postponed
 aakhri din yani 6 farvari ko banaras memrahul-akhileshki joint press conference radd kerani pad gai
 Priyanka and Sonia stayed away from campaigning
 priyanka ko lekar aakhir tak suspence bana rahaa, to sonia kii raibareli main hone vaali iklauti raily bhi nahin hui
 In such a situation, even the victory of Punjab could not relieve the Congress from the pain of up's defeat, while it could not form a government despite being the largest party in Manipur and Goa
 isliye filhal party upi main galatiyon par hi charchaa karti nazar aa rahi he
 Aamir Khan's daughter Ira Khan is going to start her career as a director
 vah ek play kaa nirdesan kar rahi hai
 The first poster of Play Eurypidas Media from the production has been released on Instagram
 poster main ek mahila green outfit main najar aa rahi he
 a blood-stained knife is also visible in the woman's hand
 ureepids media play ek pracheen greek tregedi par aadhaarit he or ise ureepids ne likhaa he
 Talking about its story, Jason leaves his wife Media and two children to marry Corinth's Queen Glauce
 iske baad media, jesan se badla lene kii aag main jalane lagati he or vah jesan kii nai patni ke saath apane bacchon ko jaan se maarane kaa faisla karti he

 surya ke raashi parivartan kaa prabhaav bura pad rahaa he to chote-chote upayon ke jariye aap un bure prabhaavon ko dur kar sakate hai, lekin baaki bachi raashiyon par surya kaa gochar kya prabhaav daal saktaa he? soramandal main maujuud grahon kaa hamaare jivan par kitna prabhaav padataa he ye vahi samaj saktaa he jisane in badlaavon ko kabhi mahasoos kiya ho
 'believe me, in the constellation where we are born, the planets present at that time affect us
 ab ye prabhaav sakaaratmak hone ke saath nakaaratmak bhi ho saktaa he
 Astrologers say that Sun is the king of planets and all planets are affected by them
 isliye surya ke raashi parivartan kaa sabhi grahon or raashiyon par prabhaav padataa he
 Let us know what will affect your zodiac sign when the Sun enters Gemini

 Campaigning for the candidates who have entered the electoral fray, preparing banner posters or collecting donations for them, everything has been done with public support
 bihar ke begusarai loksabhaa seat se chunaav maidan main utre bhartiya communist party (sipiai) ke pratyaashee kanhaiya kumaar bhi chunaav ladane kaa vahi taur tarika apana rahe hai
 But there is also a newness in it
 chunavi chande ke liye vah croudfnding kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 The party also believes that new people should come in politics and move ahead with the party according to the era in parliamentary politics
 vampanthi partiyaan ab tak poonjivadi dhang se chunaav ladane se parhez karti rahi hai
 These parties prefer to contest elections with public participation
 lekin kanhaiya kumaar nae raste par chal rahe hai or burjua kahi jane vaali anya partiyon ke chunavi tareekon kii tarj par maidan main hai
 But questions are being raised on social media about crowdfunding of Kanhaiya Kumar
 sawaal karne waalon kaa kahana he ki kya kanhaiya kumaar party se upar hai jo swayan ke liye croudfnding kar rahe hai
 On this question, Mahesh Rathi associated with CPI says that the party has given him permission
 unka kahana he ki dikkat yah he ki vampanthi partiyaan puraane tareeke se chunaav laden tab bhi kaha jaataa he ki ye partiyaan nae jamaane main feet nahin hai or nai takanic ke anusaar nahin chal rahi hai or agar left kii partiyaan nayaa rasta akhriyaar karti hai tab bhi unhen nishaanaa banaaya jaataa he
 This argument is not justified
 mahesh rathi ne aajtak
 Talked to in, 'CPI has so far been contesting elections with donations raised by party workers, trade unions, public and its organizations
 lekin bijepi, congress or anya dalon kii tarah jawaharlal nehru uniwarsity chaatrasangh ke purv adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar croudfnding kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 What is the problem? He said that donations are being taken from the public, the only difference is that the method of collecting donations has changed and the online medium is being resorted to
 kanhaiya kumaar kii chunavi team se jude raja haidar bhi mahesh rathi kii raay se sahmati jataa rahe hai
 He said, 'earlier we used to go from house to house to make donations to people, then no one came to know
 lekin ab raajnneetik chande ke liye technology, online platform kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 What can be wrong with this? ' On the question that this is the capitalist way, Raza Haider says, 'there are some old left trainees who do not like the new way
 technology to nirpeksh madhyam he, jiskaa sabhi madad lete hai, ham bhi madad le rahe hai
 'it is being told that Kanhaiya Kumar has collected 30 lakh rupees in three days through ourdemocracy, the online platform of crowdfunding, but this website has been hacked
 website ko hack kiye jane par kanhaiya kumaar ne twit kar kaha, ‘shoshit-vanchiton kii awaz uthaane waalon ko zamin par to pareshaan kiya hi jaataa he, internet par bhi unhen sazishon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 But we are not afraid of cyber attack or any other attack

 Conspiracy will be defeated, our unity will win

 britain kii ek adaalat ko bataaya gaya he ki 29 varshiya bhartiya mul ke shaks jasvir ram ginde ne kathith taur par apni samalangikta chupaane ke liye shaadi ke kuch hi maheene baad apni patni barkhaa rani kii galaa dabaakar hatya kar di or uske shav ko jala daalaa
 Wolverhampton Crown Court was told that Jasvir attacked Barkha at his home in Walsall in the Midlands with a metal pipe
 usne bageeche kii ek bhatthi main barkhaa kii laash ko jala daalaa par apane ek padosi ko bataaya ki usne kooday-kachare ko aag ke hawaale kiya he
 The court was told that Barkha and Jasvir were married in March last year
 agast maheene main vija milane ke baad barkhaa apane pati ke saath rahane ke liye britain aa gai thi
 According to prosecutor Deborah Gauld, Jasvir had told a friend that he was attracted to men since 2008
 debora ke mutabik pichley saal 12 sitambar ko barkhaa kii maut se kareeb ek maheenaa pehle uske ghar main kisi ne internet par bhatthiyon ke bare main jaankariyaan ikattha kii thi
 Jasvir had earlier told the police that his wife had used him to come to Britain
 anna ke andolan se jude or haal hi main bijepi ke piem pad ke daavedaar narendra modi ke saath manch saajha karne vaale purv thal senadhyaksh wike singh jaanch ke ghere main aa sakate hai
 The army has recommended an inquiry from the Ministry of Defense in several serious cases against him
 wike singh ke khilaaf aaropon kii fehrist kaaphi lambii he
 He faces serious charges of misusing secret service funds, illegally tapping phone calls of senior officials of the Ministry of Defense, financial malpractices to destabilize the Omar Abdullah government of Jammu and Kashmir
 mana ja rahaa he ki raksha mantralay wike singh ke khilaaf in aaropon kii jaanch sibiai se karvaa saktaa he
 If this happens, then the former general could be in big trouble
 jaankaree ke mutabik, raksha mantralay is bare main piemo ko apni report saunp saktaa he
 Thereafter some concrete steps can be taken
 sena ne raksha mantralay se general wike singh dwaara banaai gai 'sikret intelligence unit' ke kaamkaaj kii ucchstareey jaanch ke aadesh dene kaa anurodh kiya he
 The army suspects that the unit has committed 'illegal work' and financial malpractices
 sutron ke mutabik, raksha mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon kii avaidh tareeke se phone tanping karne ke aaropee takneekee sahaayta vibhaag ke bare main sena kii report haal main raksha mantralay ko saunpi gai he
 The report recommends an inquiry into the functioning of this unit
 is bare main sena mukhyalay ne kaha he ki unki ore se yah maamla band he
 The Army Headquarters declined to comment further
 sutron ke mutabik, sena apni ore se is unit ke khilaaf jaanch nahin karnaa chaahati he
 The army does not want it to take action against its former general, as it is a matter related to the credibility of the army
 par aage yah maamla kya mode letaa he, abhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 This report was prepared by Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia, Director General of Military Operations on behalf of the Board of Officers (BOO) constituted by General Bikram Singh to review the functioning of this top secret unit
 wike singh ne di safayeein khabaron par general wike singh ne kaha ki yah spasht rup se aapasi jhagada he, kyonki kuch log unke dwaara desh ke purv sainikon ke hiton ke liye narendra modi ke saath manch saajha karne se sahaj mahasoos nahin kar rahe hai
 VK Singh said that if anyone has recommended an inquiry into the activities of this unit, it is doing absolutely irresponsible, as the operation was meant to be kept a secret
 baharhaal, dekhnaa he ki sena main kai tarah kii gadbadiyon kii ore puure desh kaa dhyaan khinchne vaale wike singh apane upar lage daag dhone main kitna kaamyaab hote hai
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi has promised to write a book which will mention the tense time that came after winning the 2004 general elections when she turned the Prime Minister over and handed over the reins of the country to Manmohan Singh
 vikiliks kii ore se jari america kootnithik cabalon ke mutabik, logon kii ore se baar-baar yah puche jane ke babat ki unhone desh ke sheersh pad ko kyon nahin sweekaar kiya, sonia ne 2006 main nai dilli aayi california kii pratham mahila maaria shriver se kaha tha, ‘mujhase aksar yah poocha jaataa he, lekin logon se kahie ki kisi din main ek kitaab likhuungi jisamen puri kahani bayaan kii jaaegi
 This cable, sent in 2006, details the conversation between Sonia and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's wife Maria
 is cabel kaa shishark ‘maaria shriver ke saamne raaj kholtin gapiyati sonia gandhi’ he
 Giving details of the meeting, the cable says about Sonia that all she would say is that she liked that someone else became the Prime Minister and she did not regret her decision
 cabel ke mutabik, ‘shriver ne shrimati gandhi ko unki patibaddhta ke liye badhai di or unhen ‘saahsee’ qaraar diya
 'the leaked cable says,' at the behest of Karan Singh, Sonia talked about this and said that she was under a lot of pressure as the party workers were very disappointed
 chunki unhone unke liye matdaan kiya tha or party ko bahumat praapt hua tha, aise main ve yah nahin samaj paa rahe the ki party adhyaksh ke taur par vah pad kyon nahin grahan kar raheen
 Describing the meeting of Sonia and Shriver as amicable, the cable said that Sonia started talking openly and told some things about herself that very few people know
 cabel main kaha gaya, ‘saarvajanik taur par amuman gambhir or rigerv dikhne vaali sonia ne kaaphi lambii baatcheet kii or apni nijee jindagi ke kuch pahaluon ke alaava mahilaon se jude muddon par bhi baat kii
 According to the cable, due to the rise of BJP and right-wing politics, he was forced to enter politics even without wanting
 vikiliks dwaara jari cabel main kaha gaya ‘nijee raajnneetik rukh ke bare main shrimati gandhi ne kaha ki bharat main dakshin panth majboot ho rahaa he or congress kamjor, isliye gandhi parivaar kii viraasat ke sangrakshan ke liye unhen raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ko baadhya hona padaa
 'the cable says that they also revealed that their children did not agree with this idea very much, but finally the children said,' Whatever decision you make, we will support you
 ’sonia ne kaha ki unke mata-pita ne rajeev gandhi se shaadi par aapatti jataayi thi lekin vah apane rukh par adi raheen or aakhirkaar unase shaadi kii
 The Congress president also said that she feels that being a woman has never been an issue in her political life and Indira Gandhi also believed this
 cabel ke mutabik, jansankhya niyantran par shriver se charchaa karte hue sonia kahati hai ki is mudde par indira gandhi ko satta se baahar kar die jane ke baad bharat main ‘jansankhya niyantran’ ek raajnneetik varjana (tabu) he
 The leaked cable states, 'however he insisted that the cases of forced sterilization and other abuses were uprooted by' exaggerated and politically implicit motives'
 lekin ateet ke anubhav ne samprag ko jaagarukta badhaane or buniyadi swasthya sevaayen evam tareeke pradaan karne par dhyaan dene ko baadhya kiya jinase janmadar par swat: hi ankush lag saktaa he
 In a conversation with Shriver, Sonia says about the aspects of her personal life that she often travels in India, often travels to far-flung areas for contact with the common man as she goes out and meets people
 Problems and aspirations can be better understood
 bharat-america sambandhon par charchaa karte hue sonia mazaakia lahaze main kahati hai ki ‘bhartiya vam america virdohi’ he, lekin is baat par sahmati jataati hai ki unka yah rukh america janata kii bajaay america niti ke prati he
 Sonia also says that many Indian Muslims do not like certain policies of America

 Sharif, who was the Prime Minister of Pakistan at the time of the nuclear test, told that the then US President Bill Clinton told him that either do not conduct a nuclear test with five billion dollars or else be ready to face economic sanctions by conducting a nuclear test
 media reporton ke anusaar sharif ne bataaya, ‘maine clinton se kaha ki ham un logon main nahin he jo kuch dollars ke liye bik jaaenge
 Sharif, the head of the Muslim League, said that the then Information Minister Mushahid Hussain, at that time, had first suggested to conduct nuclear tests in response to India's nuclear tests

 ' hegg sthit antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne july main pakistan ko kulbhushan jadhav kii faansee rokane kii hidaayat di thi or unhen kootnithik pahunch dene ke liye kaha tha
 Jadhav has been in Pakistani custody since 2016 on charges of terrorism, espionage and misdemeanor and was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017
 bharat alabatta kahata rahaa he ki unhen iran se agava kiya gaya tha or pakistan main unki maujuudagi kabhi sabooton ke saath nahin bataai gai
 This week the Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia and Jadhav finally met
 magar yah bharat ke etraj ke baavjood pakistani afasaron kii maujuudagi main hui
 He also recorded the entire action
 bharat ne 1 agast ko kootnithik pahunch kii peshkash yah kahkar khaarij kar di thi ki iske niyam or sharten vienna sandhi kii bhaavana yaa kootnithik rishton ke mutabik nahin hai
 New Delhi had demanded 'unhindered' and 'unhindered' access without monitoring the Pakistani establishment
 kootnithik pahunch ke bare main vienna sandhi ke praavdhaan aspasht hai
 Pakistan states that the terms and conditions under which access was granted do not violate Article 36 (1) (c) of the treaty, which simply states that "the diplomatic authorities are imprisoned, sentenced or The right to meet, interact and correspond with the detained citizen and arrange for his legal representation '', but does not clearly state that the remitting country (india) is diplomatic That should be what kind of access
 darasal, anuchhed 36 (2) kahata he ki ''is anuchhed kaa prayog abhigrahi desh ke kanoonon or niyamon ke anuroop kiya jayega'' or abhigrahi desh is maamle main pakistan he
 Therefore, Islamabad insisted that its officers would be present, but promised that they would not interfere
 bharat ke sutron ne kaha, ''maanviya takaajon ke chalate bharat ne apane etraj darkinar kar die'' or isliye bhi ki unhen dekhnaa tha ki jadhav kii shaareerik or maansik haalat kisi he
 One thing that India stuck to was that there would be no military presence in the room, which Pakistan accepted
 mulaakaat ke liye mouhaal bahut acha to nahin tha, par bharat ko kaam chalaanaa padaa
 The Foreign Ministry said in a statement, "it was clear that Mr
 Jadhav appeared under immense pressure to tell a rote story to bolster Pakistan's baseless claims
" apane up-ucchayukta kii vistrut report milane ke baad or yah dekhne ke baad ki isije kii hidaayaton kaa kis had tak paalan kiya gaya, ham aage kii karrwai tay karenge
 "it is not surprising, especially given that this was Ahluwalia's first meeting with Jadhav
" aglaa kadam bhartiya naagarik ke liye kanoonee sahaayta or nishpaksh sunwaayee pakkaa karne kaa hoga

 ’manish tiwari ne kaha ki gadakari se jude muddon ko congress or sarkaar ne nahin balki swatantra media sanghathanon ne saarvajanik kiya
 Tiwari said, 'so instead of trying to divert attention, instead of making my own release, being my own prosecutor and judge, it would be better for the Bharatiya Janata Party to address the issues raised by independent media organizations on their president's dealings Answer ’unase yah bhi poocha ki kya bahu brands khudara kshetra main videshi pratyaksh nivesh kii ijaajat dene ke sawaal par sansad main mat vibhaajan ke liye sarkaar taiyaar he

 ’ Archana Panuli's Memoirs of the Eleventh World Hindi Conference: The eleventh World Hindi Conference concluded under the leadership of External Affairs Minister Smt
 Sushma Swaraj in Port Louis, Mauritius, a fascinating island in the Indian Ocean
 sammelan kaa mukhya vishay 'hindi vishwa or bhartiya samskruti' or uddeshy ' vaishvik str par hindi bhashaa kii pahunch badhanaa' kaa rahaa
 The Embassy of India, Denmark, gave me this golden opportunity by sending me as the representative of Denmark to this conference, for which i am extremely grateful to the Embassy
 yah mere liye vishesh garv kaa vishay va mere lekhan karm kii sarthakata he
 Ministers, founders, representatives, teachers, litterateurs, linguists, filmmakers, publishers, journalism, technology, a large gathering from every state of India and many countries related to every field gathered under the roof of Swami Vivekananda International Conference Center in Mauritius
 udghaatan satr ke turant baad atal bihari vaajapeyi ko shradhanjali satr rakhaa gaya
 a two-minute collective silence was observed
 morishas ke pradhanmantri ghoshnaa ne kii ki morishas ke sibar tower ko ab atal bihari vaajapeyi tower ke naam se janaa jayega
 Eight sub-topics on 'hindi World and Indian Culture' were discussed during the three-day conference
 vibhinn ayaamon main hindi kii sthiti par jam kar charchaa hui
 On 18 August and 19 August, there were three three-hour parallel sessions on four different subjects
 pratibhaagiyon ne apni-apni ruchi se satron kaa chayan liya
 All the sessions were running parallel, so it was not possible to participate in all
 maine 18 agast ko 'praudyogiki ke madhyam se hindi sahit bhartiya bhashaaon kaa vikaas' ke satr main bhaag liya, jisaki adhyakshata grih rajyamantri kiren rijiju ne kii

 19 agast ko maine 'pravasi sansar : bhashaa or samskruti' main bhaag liya, jiske adhyaksh da camel kishor goyanka or sah adhyaksh shri gulshan sukhlal the
 On 18 August, after dinner, Sushma Swaraj met in person with forty delegates from abroad
 dhai ghante ke satr main sabhi pratinidhiyon ne ek-ek karke unhen bataaya ki ve apane-apane mulkon main hindi ke utthan, prachaar-prasar main kya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Sushma Swaraj listened to everyone with great patience and interest
 chini, japani, indonesian, germany, italian, hungarian, fiji aadi videshiyon ke mukh se dharapravaah apni raashtra bhashaa hindi sunanaa rochak laga
 It was a unique experience
 unke kaaryon ke sandarbh main jaankaar sukhad aashcharya hua
 Some are creating a new Hindi curriculum, some are writing a new book of Hindi grammar, some are preparing a new dictionary of Hindi, and some are spreading Indian culture and philosophy
 koi apane desh ke skulon main hindi ko francisi, germany or spanish bhashaaon kaa samakaksh darja dilaane main prayatnsheel he
 Issues that Arsushma Swaraj said in her inauguration speech that it is India's responsibility to promote Hindi, and as far as making Hindi the official language of the United Nations is concerned, the main problem is that the related expenditure of the supporting countries will have to be borne
 yadi sirf bharat ko vyay vahan karnaa hota to 400 karod rupe dekar bhi ham use hasil kar lete
 He hoped that when India can get the support of 177 countries for Yoga Day, it will also gain the support of 129 countries for the language of the united nation
 vaise ham sabhi bharatiyon ke liye yah gaurav kii baat he ki sanyukt raashtra sangh ne apane twitor par hindi main apana acount banaaya he or hindi bhashaa main saptahik samachar prasaarit hone lage hai
 Swaraj quoted the animation film on the conference logo saying that the peacock of India will come and save the dodo
 is film main dikhaaya gaya he ki morishas kaa rashtriya pakshi jab doobane lagata he to bharat kaa rashtriya pakshi mor aakar use bachaata he, phir donon nrity karte hai
 Many found this animation clip of Indian peacock and dodo bird childish
 'praudyogiki ke madhyam se hindi sahit bhartiya bhashaaon kaa vikaas' ke satr main hindi or bharat kii anya bhashaaon ko hitech banane kii joardaar charchaa hui
 Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said that digital development of the language is mandatory for the new generation
 praudyogiki agali peedi ke liye atyadhik mahatvapurn he
 E-learning, e-schools are the need of the hour today
 software ke nishnaat balendu dadhich ne bhashaaon ke bhashaa kaa digitalkaran kaa prabhaavshaalee pregentation diya
 During the session 'pravasi Sansar: Language and Culture', President of Mahatma Gandhi Institute Gulshan Sukhlal said that he is a Mauritian, he should not be called Girmitiya nor should Hindi literature written in Mauritius be called Pravasi literature
 morishas main likhaa hindi sahitya isi prakaar he jo australia, newjiland, america, england ke nivaasiyon dwaara likhaa sahitya sirf angareji sahitya kahalaaya jaataa he, sahitya kii yah khemebaaji vahaan nahin he
 Sukhlal also objected to the people of the conference, saying that the conference is being held in Mauritius and his opinion was not taken to decide the logo of the conference
 dodo ko to vilupt hue teen sau varsh se adhik ho chuke hai, is logo kaa kya taatpary
 But i would like to say here that the island of Mauritius is also known as the last and only home of the extinct dodo bird, so the interpretation of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was not meaningless
 mudde jo nahin uthesammelan main kai mudde uthe to kai mudde nahin uthe
 There was a huge crowd, about two thousand Hindi scholars and lovers
 sabhi kaa bolne kaa avasar milanaa naammumkin tha, phir bhi kuch vaktaa manch par phaltu kii bakawaas kar gayi, kuchon ke sargarbhit vichaar unke adharon par hi thithke rahe
 However, the fact is that the number of Hindi speakers in Mauritius is constantly decreasing
 swayan morishas ke pradhanmantri praveen kumaar jagannatha hindi nahin bol paae
 Although i have met many local people who speak Hindi, official figures show that the number of Hindi speakers in Mauritius has been steadily decreasing, and today it has come under the category of other regional languages
 da times of india kii ek khabar ke anusaar, bharat main, visheshkar hindi bolne vaale rajyon main angreji madhyam ke skulon main chaatro kaa namakan pichley paanch saal main doguna ho gaya he
 If this is the case, by 2050, enrollment of students in English medium schools will increase to 70 percent
 desh main angrejior falegi-phuulegi
 Writer Harjendra Chaudhary said in this context that language is reality, not sentimentality
 jab tak koi bhashaa rojgaar kii bhashaa nahin banegi log ise apanaayenge nahin
 Assuming that English, French, Spanish languages have dominated various countries due to their colonial rule, but Mandarin, Japanese and Arabic languages have progressed on their own

 We are all guilty for this
 maine sammelan main bharat se aaye 20-25 pratibhaagiyon se poocha ki unke bachche kis madhyam vaale skulon main padhaten hai
 Everyone's answer was - in English medium
 hindi madhyam vaale skulon main ve bachche hai, jo angrejimadhyam vaale skulon kaa kharchaa uthaa nahin sakate yaa sudur gramin ilaakon main jahaan unhen angrejimadhyam vaale skool sulabh nahin hai
 It is to be seen that today the real tyrant of our national language is on the shoulders of the poor
 bollywood filmon or hamaare dharmagranthon, puja-paath ne hindi ko kuch mahatv de rakhaa he, nahin to hindi chaupat ho rahi he
 The roots are getting hollow and we are looking upwards
 apana astitv bachaane ke liye kai sarkari skulon ne bhi angareji madhyam apnaane kaa faisla kar liya he
 The organization of the conference: There is no doubt that the organizers and activists who organized the conference were busy working day and night, but it was felt that Mauritius was not able to manage such a large number of participants
 mainpavar kii kami lagi
 Most of the mess occurred in the registration of people attending the conference
 takneekee gadabadi se kaiyon kaa panjikaran online ho hi nahin paaya, jisase unhen dikkat hui
 The organizers sitting at the reception counters did not know who to place in the category of representative members, special invitees or ordinary participants
 apni-apni panjikaran haisiyat ke anusaar sabhi ko naarangi, hare, pile or nile rang ke baij (bille) bant rahen the
 The criteria for determining the color of the badge was not understood, because many participants who were of the same background, had the same status, received different colored badges
 vibhinn deshon se padhaare kuch sarkari pratinidhiyon ko bhi alag alag rang ke baij mili
 The people registering had no answer
 khayr baij bina gale main latakaae kaarykram main upasthit hone kii anumati nahin thi, or baij ke rang ke anusaar haul main baithne kaa sthaan or bhojan pandal main ghusane kii ijaajat thi
 Orange badge holders (representative members), occupying the front seats of the hall, then green badges (special invitees), finally blue badge holders (general participants), who had the largest number
 chaay-pani or bhojan ke do pandal the
 Orange badge holder on better pandal, where crowd less, arrangement good
 is pandal main hare or nile baijadhaariyon kaa pravesh nishiddh tha
 In the second pandal, green and blue badge holders, that is, for the usual participants, the long queues to eat, the crowds were crowded, many times the participants did not think it was appropriate to queue up for a cup of cold tea
 ve bina chaay-pani ke rahe
 Having lived in Denmark for the last twenty years, i got such discrimination
 yahaan kisi bhi str ke kaarykram main kam se kam khaane-pine kii vyavastha sabhi ke liye ek jaisi rahati he, bhale hi das pandal lagane pad jaaen
 Whether there is a king or a rake, there is no discrimination
 koi kahin bhi jaakar baith kar kha saktaa he
 Several ministers of India and Mauritius participated in the closing ceremony on Monday, 20 August, the last day of the conference
 sammelan ke dauraan hindi ke prasar ke liye aath anushansaaen prastut kii gayi
 The acting President of Mauritius Parmashivam Pillai Vyapuri has said that Hindi will strengthen world peace
 puraskaar praptakarta adhiktar videshi or bharat ke ahindi bhashi pradeshon ke the
 Hindi is not his mother tongue but he has embraced Hindi, probably he was honored by keeping this in mind
 khayr fiji se aaye ek puraskaar praptakarta - nemaani adivasai itane adhik bhavuk ho gayi ki jab unhen puraskaar mila to ve lambe-chaude insaan sushamaa swaraj ke charnon par palathi maar kar baith gayi
 He said that Fiji sat down to follow its practice of honor
 mujhe bhi vyaktigat taur par sushamaa swaraj ke vyaktitv ne atyadhik prabhavit kiya
 His authority over Hindi language, his art of delivering speeches is so much more impressive that the praise is less
 yah meraa ahobhagya ki sushamaa swaraj jaisi vidhushi se samvaad kaa mujhe avasar mila

 In the conference, i met many people who had no meaning in Hindi

 Many tour groups have been formed in India, which gather people and take a tour of the world
 sabhi ko sammelan main bhaag lenaa muft nahin padaa
 Many people came to attend the conference at their own expense, spending a lot of money
 hawaii tikat, hotel vagairah kaa vyay uthaane ke atirikt unhone sammelan main panjikaran shulk paanch hajaar rupaya shulk bhi adaa kiya
 Well in this context, i believe that we should not only gather Hindi scholars and maharathis of literary circles in the conference
 in sammelnon main saadhaaran nagarikon kii upasthiti ati anivaary hai
 If this conference could inspire them towards Hindi, then this is the real success of the conference
 maurishas ke voila hotel main sammelan ke kai pratibhaagi tike the, jinamein hungary se aaye da peter shaagi or sweden se aaye da hins warner bhi the

 'koi viraani si viraani haidasht ko dekh ke ghar yaad aayaa'gaalib kii ye panktiyaan aaj unheen ke ghar or makbare kii badahaal sthiti kii hakeekat bayaan kar rahi hai
 Mirza Ghalib, the great Urdu poet, breathed his last at his mansion on 15 February 1869 at Ballimaran in Shahjahanabad, Old Delhi, and was buried near Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah near Chaushat Khamba
 gaalib ke intkaal ke sau saal baad bhi unki kabr kii pahchaan kaayam rakhane ke liye koi nirmaan kaary nahin kiya gaya, jab tak ki unka ek behad prashansak angrej unki kabr kii khoj karata hua saat samandar paar se dilli nahin chalaa aayaa
 Finding no trace of Ghalib's grave, he wrote an article related to it in the newspaper
 tab jaakar is baat kaa pataa chalaa ki gaalib ke intkaal ke baad se unki nishaani ke taur par koi jagah hi chinhit nahin thi
 After this, with the efforts of Hakim Abdul Hameed of film actors Shohrab Modi and Hamdard, the construction of a beautiful mausoleum on Ghalib's tomb was possible
 aaj bharat kii anya dharoharon kii hi tarah gaalib kaa makbara bhi bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag kii dekharekh main he lekin uski haalat behad khasta ho chali he
 The keys to the entrance of the mausoleum have been handed over to the security guards and this is where the real trouble of the audience begins
 jab 10 ke kareeb log guard se chaabi ke bare main puch chuke to tawqir naamak us buudhe ne aawaaj lagaai, 'babu bhai
 
 !' lekin koi bhi nahin aayaa
 Then he started searching for the key between the mug, an umbrella blackened with dirt and broken pottery
 or antat: chaabi chaate ke andar mili
 The condition of Ghalib's mansion is also not much better
 130 varg gaj main faili yah haveli jarjar haalat main padi hui he
 There is neither light nor any life here
 dilli sarkaar se kai baar anurodh kiye jane ke baavjood shahar ke mahaan shaayar kii smriti main is bhawan kii haalat sudhaarney or saundaryikaran ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya gaya
 The end of Ghalib who suffered all the time was equally painful
 apni har pyaari cheez se unhen haath dhonaa padaa
 When he was a child, the father went to Allah and when he was a teenager, the elder brother passed away
 khud gaalib ke saat bacchon main se koi bhi jivit nahin bachaa
 He adopted a child after losing but he also died while growing up
 in traasadiyon ne gaalib ko andar tak tod diya lekin ise allaah kii marji maanakar vah usase lade nahin, balki yah kaha
 
 
 Whom should the Asad of gum-e-hasti treat the marriage, the cure burns in every color till the day
 kaha jaataa he ki gaalib ek bahut badi riyasat ke vaaris the lekin unhen apane purvajon se viraasat main mili daulat kaa jaraa bhi gumaan nahin tha or insaani rishton ko vah kahin zyada tarjeeh dete the jo unki shaayari main bhi jhalkata he
 In his poetry, he sometimes outlines various aspects of life as a lover, sometimes as a seer, sometimes as a bow bowed before Allah
 gaalib ke saath bahut si vichitrataaen bhi thim
 Ghalib's neighbors have many interesting stories associated with him
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki vah sari raat chiraag kii maddhim si lau main apane khayalon main duubate-utaraate hue kapade ke ek bade se tukade ke saath khelte hue baithe rahete the
 When he was satisfied with the ash of the ghazal, he used to tie a knot in the cloth to remember it
 yahi karte hue vah sari raat bitaa dete the
 On waking the next day, he used to open every knot of cloth slowly and he remembered the lines made in the night
 aisa gaalib hi kar sakate the
 a hundred salutes to the wild king of the world of peace
 pesh hai gaalib kii kuch panktiyaan
 
 
 It was imperative to look at the miraculous path some day, and why you stay there someday or else it will be lost, but at the rate of no stone, there will be no other day for any other day, and today you say that i should always be good, no one Day by day, you will say, doom will get plenty, what do you do for a day, and there was a day where you were 'arif', your worsening, which would not die any day and you were mahe-shebe-chardham
 Why did you not have that house map for some day and who were you like, sincere, no matter how much you have been doing, no matter what you are doing, no day and i hate you
 It was to be happy, resentful, live some day, and say, why do you live, 'ghalib' is in luck, the desire to die is another day

 dilli main bijepi ne manoj tiwari ko adhyaksh banaakar kyon purvachanli daanv chalaa, ye sawaal dilli kii raajnneeti karne or samajhane waalon ko bhi pareshaan kar rahaa he, lekin manoj tiwari ke adhyaksh banate hi is sawaal ke jawaab bhi apane aap hi saamne aane lage hai
 Delhi BJP convened the conference of Purvanchal Morcha for the first time on Friday after Tiwari became the president and it got a full glimpse of Manoj Tiwari's stardom
 purvanchal ke matadaataaon kii dilli main acchhee khaasi taadaad he or bijepi aane vaale emsidi chunaavon main is vot bank ko apni taraf lubhaane kii puri koshish main he, kyonki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main purvaanchaliyon kaa samarthan hasil karne main aam aadmi party kaamyaab rahi thi
 That is why BJP, which is keeping Vaishya Punjabi's equation ahead, is taking Purvanchali bets this time, not only that Purvanchali president Manoj Tiwari will be the star campaigner in his home state of Uttar Pradesh, but this time as his Delhi BJP president
 But the new identity can also be beneficial for the party
 haalankimanoj tiwarine is par kaha ki wo sabake hai or sab unke hai
 He said that after becoming Delhi BJP President, he is not a leader of one front, but he has come to join his seat as an MP and the happiness and misery of the people of entire Delhi as the Speaker
 isiilie chunavi ganit se alag unka dilli se rishta he
 But Tiwari also wants to use BJP to change the image
 kyonki bijepi ko dilli main bhi vyapaaree varg se jodakar dekha jaataa rahaa he or kaman bhi zyaadaatar isi sameekaran ko dhyaan main rakhkar di jaati rahi he, aise main ab bijepi na sirf is sameekaran main purvi angel jod rahi he, balki tiwari ke staradam kaa istemaal bhi karne main peeche nahin he
 Manoj Tiwari is spending the night in different slums of Delhi after becoming president
 daawa ye he ki wo aisa karke jhuggavaalon kii pareshaani ko samajhnaa chaahate hai, lekin makasad jhuggi main basane vaale dalit or purvaanchali votaron ke dil main jagah bananaa bhi he
 Former Mayor of East Delhi Ramnarayan Dubey says that Manoj Tiwari goes straight into the heart of the people, not as a leader but he meets people like him
 ye ranneeti is baat se bhi pataa chalati he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik kaarykram main manoj tiwari adhyaksh ke taur par bhaashan to dete hai, lekin unhen pataa he ki log unhen gayak manoj tiwari or bhojpuri star ke taur par jaanane, dekhne or sunne aate hai, isiilie kisi na kisi bahaane se logon kii is ichha yaa farmaaish ko bhi puraa kar hi dete hai
 At Poorvanchal's conference, Tiwari did not hold back from spreading his voice
