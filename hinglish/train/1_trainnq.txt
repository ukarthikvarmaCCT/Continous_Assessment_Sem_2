 aapkaa vyaktitv kai chizon se milakar banataa he
 And voice plays an important role in all this
 madhur aawaaj khud-ba-khud aapako khinch leti he apni ore
 Even if you do not want to divert your attention from him
 aapaki nazren us aawaaj ke maalik ko talashne lagati hai
 If there is a desire, then just like its sister, who has tied your steps like a sweet chain
 kai baar hamen aise log mil jate hai, jinaki vaani hamen kisi mohpash kii tarah jakad leti he
 And perhaps this is the reason why we pay more attention to his words
 ye unki aawaaj kaa jaadu nahin, to phir or kya he
 It is your responsibility to maintain this unique nature of nature
 agar aap aawaaj ke sahare apana kariyar banane kii soch rahe hai, to aapke liye isaki rakhwali karnaa or bhi jaruri ho jaataa he or kahin agar aap aisa nahin bhi chaahate, phir bhi aapkaa ferj he ki apni aawaaj kaa puraa khyal rakhen
 How to maintain the noise of the voice of the voice keeps rising
 lekin, aapaki aawaaj main yah nasha barkaraar rahe iske liye jaruri he ki ise takalifon se bachaakar rakhen
 Avoid breathing problems: First of all, see a doctor if you have any shortness of breath or sinus
 saans kii lay par hi to thirakati he acchhee aawaaj
 If you wish that the style of your voice is correct, then keep the movement of your breath normal
 vaataanukoolit vaataavaran main rahane kii koshish karen
 It is beneficial for good voice
 thande vaataavaran se garam vaataavaran main kuch samay ruk kar jaaen
 To keep the voice correct, do not inhale through the mouth, never sleep directly below or in front of the sharp fan
 thandi or garam hawa se jarur bachein
 Both affect the nose and throat and the sound does not come out properly
 isse khaansee kii bhi shikaayat ho sakati he
 Keep catering care: To keep your voice correct, it is important that your food is right
 aniyamit dincharya or khan-paan kii galat aadaton se riplux yaa amla kii samasya ho sakati he
 This may cause complaints such as some stuck in the throat, cough, frequent throat irritation, tongue congestion, bronchitis
 agar aap aawaaj kii duniya se jud hue he to koshish karen kii sada bhojan hi karen
 Do not drink more chili-spices, oily food, more tea, coffee, soft drinks or alcohol
 saath hi bhojan se pehle chocolate, sookhe mewa aadi naa len
 Apart from this, stay away from things like paan, pan masala, gutkha, tobacco
 in baton kaa bhi rakhen puraa dhyaan:tej sardi, acute allergy, naak-gale ke sankraman ke dauraan aawaaj se judaa koi abhyaas naa karen
 Try not to speak continuously for more than 45 minutes
 ooncha bolne, cheekhney-chillane or tanaavpurn dhang se aawaaj nikaalane se bachein
 Avoid dust, dirt
 khaskar, naak kii allergy se grasit log dhul, dhuen, mites, fafood aadi se bachane kii koshish karen
 Do not get used to cleaning the throat again and again
 samasya hone par upyukt ilaaj karavaaen
 Use more make-up, hair or any kind of spray with great care and less
 gayan, bhajan, bhaashan yaa baatcheet ke dauraan galaa na sookhne den
 Drink water in between
 halkaa, gunaguna, shahadyukt pani kaarykram ke dauraan nirantar pite rahen
 Avoid stress because both physical and mental stress have side effects on voice
 isliye puri neend len or aaraam jarur karen
 If you are connected to the world of voice, then avoid crowded, noisy parties, because in such places, you have to talk loudly, which can cause stress on the vocal instrument
 in sab tareekon ko aajamaakar aap apni aawaaj ko sahi rakh sakate hai
 Remember that it is not only beneficial for you to appreciate and preserve God's gift of voice, but it is also your responsibility to do so

 She believes in telling the news pure, easy and without adulteration
 unka maananaa he ki jo khabaren jeeta he vahi khabaren bataa saktaa he na ki wo jo sirf sunakar khabaren padhata he
 Kali Puri has a lot of experience in running all media properties including TV channels, apps, digital newspapers, organizing international events and creating social media strategies for the group

 The governance which was the identity of Nitish Kumar, now the finger is being raised on the same governance, this finger is not being raised for any bad governance but on the ways of running the government
 nitish sarkaar par ye aarope lagane laga he ki nitish kii sarkaar apane cabinet ke sahare nahin balki ab kansaltent ke bharose chal rahi he or ye kansaltent hi nitish kumaar ke super ministar or super cabinet bhi ban gaye hai
 These super ministers and super cabinet Nitish Kumar are being asked for those advisors who advise Nitish Kumar on policy matters
 haal main kendriya grih sachiv ke pad se ritair hokar bihar laute, aar
 K
 singh, nitish ke nae salaahkaar honge sarkaar ne iskaa elaan kar diya he lekin isi elaan ke saath hi nitish sarkaar par bhi sawaalon kii bauchhaar shuru ho gai he ki pehle se hi teen salaahkaaron ke baad kya sarkaar salaahkaaron kii fouj khadaa karnaa chaahati he? kya nitish kumaar mantriyon ke bajaae kansaltent ke bharose hi sarkaar chalaanaa chaahate hai? satta se alag hone ke baad bijepi ne nitish sarkaar ko is mudde par gherna shuru kar diya he
 The BJP alleges that the Nitish government is avoiding cabinet expansion to suppress the rebellion in the party and instead of 18 ministers, it wants to run with the help of advisors
 patna main susheel modi ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki - nitish kumaar kaa swabhaav rahaa he ki wo naukarshahon par zyada vishwaas karte hai or wo ab mantrimandal vistaar kar nahin sakate,jis din mantrimandal kaa vistaar karenge unke dal main baari visphot ho jayega vidroh kii sthiti paidaa ho jaaegi isliye wo salaahkaar ko mantriyon ke vikalp ke rup main niyukt kar istemaal kar rahe hai
 But bureaucrats can never be an alternative to politicians, who are restored are qualified people, but elections were not required if the country was run by bureaucrats
 is samay nitish kumaar ke teen salaahkar he jisamen pawan verma saanskrithik maamalon ke salaahkaar hai to mangala raay krishi maamalon par nitish kumaar ke salaahkaar he, pi
 K
 raay bijli maamlo ke salaahkaar jabaki aar
 K
 sih chauthe salaahkaar honge jo infrastracchar maamalon par salaah denge
 In fact, since the separation of the BJP, the Chief Minister has 18 more departments and in most of the departments the government is running due to these advisors, but Nitish's minister is denying this opposition charge
 nitish ke kareebi or khaadya or upabhokta mantri shyaam rajak ise bijepi kaa baukhalaahat qaraar dete he
 According to Shyam Rajak, the post of advisor to the Chief Minister is not new and he was an advisor even when he was with the BJP, we want to take advantage of the qualifications of retired bureaucrats, so it is advisable, it is not that a minister came under any bureaucrat Rather, we are using his experience and ability in the state interest
 rahi baat bijepi kii to jinhen dhakiyakar hamane baahar kar diya he wo anargal bolenge hi
 Although Nitish Kumar has denied these allegations, there is a lot of resentment among his ministers but no one dares to speak against Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar ke paas 18 vibhaag he jisamen se sadak,swasthya paryaton or kala samskruti jaise vibhaag mahatavpurn hote hue bhi bina mantriyon ke do maheene se chal rahe hai

 Here are the three battlefields, where three members of the Gandhi family have added a new chapter to the political dialogue of the country by beating
 raibareli se congress kii rashtriya adhyaksh sonia gandhi chunaav maidan main hai to bagal kii seat amethi se rahul gandhi
 Now, after Rahul's cousin Varun Gandhi blew the election bugle from Sultanpur, this area spread over 12,000 sq km has become the work place of Gandhi family
 rahul kii raah kathinvidhansabha chunaav main karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi pehali baar 22 janvari ko bahan priyanka gandhi ke saath do din ke daure par amethi pahunche
 After landing at the Fursatganj airstrip at 5 pm, he traveled about 20 km to inaugurate the new office of the District Congress
 is bich rahul ko aadha darjan jagahon par sthaneey logon ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Even outside the Congress office, slogans were raised against Rahul, then Priyanka Gandhi, sitting in another car behind, immediately caught the way to the Munshiganj guest house
 yah pehla mauka tha jab rahul gandhi ko apane sansadeey kshetra main is tarah virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 From the leaders of British Labor Party, David Milliband to Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and Kumaramangalam Birla to Bill Gates, Rahul has not been able to fulfill his claim of giving middle class life to the poor here
 Huh
 isi bich aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaa kumaar vishwaas ne rahul ke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye kii ghoshnaa ke saath amethi ke pichhadepan ko jaise hi mudda banaaya, logon kaa dard ubhar aayaa
 Kumar Vishwas, who has panchayat in 500 villages in Amethi during the last two months, says, "rahul has insulted the people here by showing the backwardness of Amethi to big personalities
" ve jawaab den ki centre sarkaar ke 1,600 karod ru
 Why is Amethi in disarray even after it is spent? '' The party sent Sanjay Singh, an MP from Sultanpur who was angry with Congress and Sanjay Singh, who was holding Amethi, to Rajya Sabha from Assam to strengthen Rahul's Amethi Fort and his wife Amita Singh from Sultanpur
 Also gave a Lok Sabha ticket from pichley chah maheene main amethi main ek darjan yojanaon kii neenv daalkar rahul 2009 ke pradarshan ko dohraane ke liye bekaraar hai, jab ve record chaar lakh voton se jite the
 Sonia's fortress, "madame", we have built a house on our land, and now we do not give compensation
 ab aapai kachu karo, tabaheen hamaar muaavja mili
 Sonia Gandhi could not understand this quote of farmer Lal Bahadur, but it did not take long to realize that the farmers associated with the central assistance housing scheme in Barwaripur village of Rahi block of Rae Bareli, their parliamentary constituency, are upset
 loksabhaa kaa satr khatm karke 24 farvari ko do din ke daure par raibareli pahunchin sonia gandhi ne 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad pehali baar gaanvon kaa daura kiya or gharon ke bheetar ghuskar logon kii samasyaayein sunin
 Sensing the rise of the AAP and the atmosphere created in opposition to the Congress at the national level, he has set himself up to save this safest fort
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main paune chaar lakh voton se sonia gandhi ko jitaane vaala raibareli sansadeey kshetra teen saal baad hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko paanch main se ek seat na dilaa sakaa
 Now, to overcome their electoral stagnation, efforts are being made to apply caste equations
 raibareli ke brahman bahul ilaake lalganj main sthaneey netaa lagaataar sabhaayen kar rahe hai to muslim bahul ilaake main chaoupal lagaakar samarthan batora ja rahaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi has given the details of caste structure at the panchayat level
 pichley 10 varshon ke dauraan rail coach factory, petroleum technology santhaan kii raibareli main shuruyaat karne vaali sonia ne pichley dinon khiron, sataanv, sareni or bachhraavaan main khaare pani kii samasya se nibatane ke liye paanch reverse osmosis plant lagavaaye hai, jahaan 20 litre pani ek rupye main miltaa he
 Despite this, their path is not easy
 10 varshon se gandhi parivaar ke is garh ko surakshit rakhane vaali sonia gandhi ko is baar kuch zyada pasinaa bahaanaa hoga
 (sonia Gandhi during the election campaign in Rae Bareli) Politics in the name of heritage '' My father Sanjay Gandhi had identified Amethi on the globe
 aapane meri daadi indira gandhi or pita sanjay gandhi ko dekha he

 Varun Gandhi, the MP from Pilibhit, who has announced to contest from Sultanpur parliamentary constituency, has a different style this time
 is baar unhone apane pita or daadi kii viraasat par daawa thoka he
 (varun Gandhi addressing an election rally in Sultanpur) Although Varun and Rahul are contesting from adjacent parliamentary constituencies, there has been a war between two members of the Gandhi family in the past, when Amethi was a part of Sultanpur district 
 1984 main indira gandhi kii mrityu ke baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main amethi se rajeev gandhi ke virodh main sanjay vichaar manch se varun kii maa menka gandhi ne chunaav ladaa tha lekin haar gai thim
 But on the basis of these old memories and attitude, Varun Gandhi has managed to make a new beginning from Sultanpur
 nishchit hi uttar pradesh kaa chunavi ran sabase romaanchak hoga
 Rahul's favorable position in Amethi: his stature in the politics of the country, emotional association with Amethi, Rahul's strategy to garner support from Brahmins, Thakurs, Dalits and Muslims
 pratikul sthiti:amethi ke pichhadepan ko lekar janata main asantosh, aam janata kii rahul tak pahunch na hona
 Sonia Gandhi's favorable position in Rae Bareli: The possibility of polarization of non-muslim votes

 The total expenditure in the form of tuition and hostel fees for Indian students studying abroad has increased by 44 percent
 yah kharch 2013-14 main 1
 9 billion dollars, which increased to 2 in 2017-18
 8 arab dollar ho chukaa he
 a recent report by the Reserve Bank of India has estimated that by 2024, nearly 400,000 Indian students will enroll in foreign universities
 yah aankade saaf bataate hai ki apane chaatro ko ucch shiksha ke liye videsh bhejne ke maamle main china ke baad bharat doosraa sabase mahatvapurn desh he
 At present, more than 5 million students worldwide are studying outside their country and there is a large number of Indian students
 videshi shiksha hasil karne ke maamle main bharatiyon kii pehali pasand america, canada or euke jaise desh hai
 It is followed by Singapore, China, Australia and other European countries such as Germany and France
 arabiai kii report ke mutabik, ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jane vaale kul bhartiya chaatro main 85 fisadi inhen deshon main jate hai
 However, the number of Indian students enrolled in universities of many other countries has also increased
 policy bazaar ke chif bijness afisar tarun maathur kaa kahana he ki ucch shiksha ke liye videsh jate vakt medical kharcho ko cover karnaa travel insurance kharidne ke sabase jaruri kaarnon main se ek he
 Needless to say that medical expenses abroad can be quite expensive compared to India
 udhaaharan ke taur par, america main ek doctor kii kansaltesan fees 300 se 400 dollar ke bich he, jo ki bharat ke liye 20,500 se 27,000 rupee ke aasapaas hoti he
 He said that if a student falls ill abroad without travel insurance, then he / she will have to spend their one week budget only in consultation with doctor / emergency room visit charges, which does not include the cost of medicines
 aise main insurance cover lenaa behad jaruri hota he taaki biimaar padane par hone vaale kharch se bachaa ja sake
 Mathur said that Student Travel Insurance gives you comprehensive coverage for medical emergency as well as protection for other potential problems such as interruption of studies, sponsor protection, cancellation of university accreditation, loss of laptop / table, travel Lost baggage, passport or other important documents during aise main yah sunishchit karnaa behad jaruri he ki ek student travel insurance kharidte vakt kuch behad gambhir pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae
 One of the most important aspects is to see that your student travel insurance follows the guidelines issued by your university
 student travel insurance plan kaa kawarej uniwarsity ke dishanirdeshon ke anukool naa hone par sambandhit uniwarsity ke paas student kaa insurance wevar benifit asweekaar karne yaa admician hi radd karne kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 Most universities in the US and Canada demand that international students keep an insurance plan for themselves that covers all the expenses of pre-existing diseases, drug habit, pregnancy and mental illness without any sub-limit
 iske alaava, kuch uniwarsities is baat par bhi jor detii hai ki antarrashtriya chaatr apane grih deshon kii insurance companiyon se hi travel insurance khariden
 It is also better for Indian students going abroad to buy travel policy from insurance companies of India as the prices are very low here and the students also get more benefits

 Asked why the BJP did not immediately reject ncp's proposal, the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra said that there will be no alliance with NCP, someone supports themselves and from that our government's numbers go ahead, so why should we say that Don't we want? We had to run a government with them, so why would we talk to the Shiv Sena? We have to run a government with Shiv Sena
 hamaari baatcheet jari he
 Fadnavis was asked if his hand would ever stop acting against the NCP? In response to this, Fadnavis said that whoever will make a mistake or who has made a mistake, we will not spare anyone, irrespective of any party
 nae mukhyamantri se poocha gaya ki kai daagi bijepi se jude hai, chunakar aae hai
 Will they become ministers? On this, Devendra Fadnavis said that the action is going on, it will continue
 aapane dekha he ki hamane kise mantri banaaya he
 You will also see in the future who we make ministers
 fadanvis se sawaal kiya gaya ki dilli main bijepi ke paas aankada nahin tha, to vahaan aapane sarkaar nahin banaai
 Even in Maharashtra, you do not have data, then why formed a government here? Fadnavis said that Delhi has its own politics, Maharashtra has its own politics

 Controversy has arisen over the clothes worn by Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan
 pakistani media main prakashit report main kaha gaya he ki ek taraf yah daawa kiya gaya he ki yah kapade imran kii patni bushara bibi ne ek aam darji se silvaaye
 But some more claims from an expensive designer store have made matters complicated
 imran khan ne america raashtrapati donald trump va anya america adhikariyon se mulaakaat ke dauraan paramparaagat pakistani salwar kameez or apni pasandida peshawari chappal pahani thi
 Imran's close friends say that Imran wore simple clothes and was sewn with a tailor who took less stitching
 lekin, islamabad sthit paridhaanon ke lagjri store 'mohataram' ne apni peeth thapthapate hue bataaya ki usne pradhanmantri ke liye saat salwar kameez sili thim
 This designer store is not considered cheaper than anywhere
 yahaan ek saamaanya salwar kameez suut kam se kam solah hajaar pakistani rupee main miltaa he
 If you want to wear a jacket from above, its charge is different and that too is not reduced
 america ne pakistan ke F-16 ladaaku vimaanon ko takneekee sahyog dene ke liye bricri ko di manzooriabhi yah saaf nahin he ki 'mohataram' ne jin kapadon ko silne kaa daawa kiya he, imran ne america main vahi kapade pahane the yaa nahin
 When CEO Fahd Saif of the designer store was asked about this, he refused to say anything
 ek anya mahange store 'laa fabrika' ne bhi daawa kiya he ki pradhanmantri ke liye westcot usee ne banaai thi
 However, he too has not said clearly that his finished Westcoat was worn by Imran in America
 pravasi pakistaniyon ke maamalon va maanav sansaadhan maamalon main pradhanmantri ke vishesh sahaayak julfi bukhari ne diziner kapadon kii baat ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki imran kii patni bushara bibi ne khud in kapadon ko kharida tha or aise sthaneey darji se silvaya tha jo silaai adhik nahin letaa
 Bike riders were passing over the swollen river, only then the steep road and then
 
 
 dekhen videobukari ne twit kiya, "pradhanmantri kabhi bhi diziner kapadon main na ruchi lete hai, na hi pahante hai, khaskar apane saadhaaran salwar kameez ke maamle main
 Anyone who wants to take credit for designer clothes is not only a liar but also a fraud

Society in which a person is arrested without any evidence? In the India Today Conclave 2014 'the limits of Liberty' session, the country's well-known lawyer Harish Salve raised these questions
 is satr main bolte hue harish salve ne kaha, 'rashtrahit ke naam par loktantr ko sabase zyada nuksaan pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 The fundamental rights found in the constitution are being violated through precautionary arrests, emergencies, censors on the media, phone tapping and spying

 kis tarah se hamaari privet life kii dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai, ye sach saamne nahin aata
 "harish Salve said," The government says that we are trying to save the society
 par hamen ye yah tay karnaa hoga ki ham kis socity main rahanaa chaahate hai
 a society in which you should be arrested in the name of national interest
 dharm ke aadhaar par aap par aatanki kaa thappa laga diya jaae

 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh par kalank lage, isliye ise file kiya gaya tha
 BJP strongly condemns this
 rahul gandhi kii ore se hamaare party adhyaksh ke khilaaf aarope lagaae gaye, yah puraa kaa puraa raajnneeti se prerit maamla tha
 Public interest was not motivated
 'kya kahenge rahul gandhiravishankar prasad ne rahul gandhi se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki is maamle main rahul gandhi aage badhkar bol rahe the
 He took a delegation to the President and also made allegations against our President
 bijepi ke khilaaf aarope lagaae, lekin ab supreme court kaa jo faisla aayaa he
 What does Rahul Gandhi have to say on that? faisle ke baad aakraamak tevar main bolte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki congress janata kii adaalat main baar-baar haarane ke baad bhi ab court ke galiyare se raajnneeti ko aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad says that everyone has the right to go to court
 desh aaazaad he
 Before the Supreme Court's verdict, we, our party, ministers, and Amit Shah did not speak on this matter, because the matter was in court
 lekin supreme court ke faisle ke baad congress ko jawaab dena chahie
 He did not comment in the case of the judges, he said that the fight of the people should be fought among the people and not through the court, by lowering the dignity of the court
 rahul gandhi is mudde par maafee maangen
 The Congress party has been exposed to the country
 kanoon mantri ne kaha, 'supreme court kaa nirnay antim hota he or main chaar jajon ke maamle main koi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta hum

 faisle ke baad congress ne kaha ki is maamle main kai sawaal abhi bhi ansulajhe hai
 Randeep Surjewala said that two more comrades had also died after the death of Judge Loya
 is maamle main kai tarah ke aarope saamne aae
 The case should be investigated objectively
 unhone maamle main kai sawaal uthaae
 Surjewala said that today is a very sad day, the investigation into the death of Judge Loya was very serious
 unhone kaha ki wo soharabuddin maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the, jisamen amit shah kaa naam aayaa tha

 The government was trying to get this bill passed in the Rajya Sabha in the same session, which ends on Friday
 lekin chunki sarkaar ke paas ucch sadan main bahumat bhi nahin he,or is bill ko lekar to do sahyogi dal - shivasena tathaa telugudesham party - bhi unka saath nahi de rahe hai
 Apart from these, Allied parties like AIADMK and Biju Janata Dal are also not supporting the government on this issue, and want the Bill to be referred to the Select Committee

 The Anti Corruption Bureau of Chhattisgarh came under so much pressure from two IAS officers that they did not arrest both even after getting permission from the Central Government for prosecution
 naa hi unke khilaaf saboot jutaney main dilchaspee dikhaai
 The investigation into the role of former state food secretary Alok Shukla and managing director Anil Tuteja caught in the Civil Supplies Rules scam has been closed by the Economic Offenses Wing (EOW), while the EOW filed a challan against 14 officers including babus and accountants
 is
 EOW ne is ghotaale main naagarik aapurti niyam ke emdi anil tuteja ke chembar se kamishan ke 90 lakh rupye jabt kiye the
 Now the pressure of the IAS lobby is suffocating the EOW
 aamtaur par EOW jis bhrasht afasar ke khilaaf karrwai karata he uski giraftaar bhi jald hi ho jaati he
 The challan is also submitted within the stipulated time frame
 lekin is maamle main jarurat se zyada dhilaai barti ja rahi he
 Whereas the EOW has obtained strong evidence against both the officers long back
 iske chalate hi donon iees afasaron ke khilaaf giraftaar kii prakriya shuru kii gai thi
 On the basis of the evidence, approval of the prosecution was sought from the Central Government
 centre ne abhiyojan kii sweekruti arase pehle de di
 Despite this, the EOW put the matter on hold
 afasaron ne di dhamkibataya ja rahaa he ki donon hi afasaron ne sarkaar ko dhamkee di he ki yadi unki giraftaar hui to ve bade paimaane par hue is bhrashtachar kaa kaala chittha khol denge
 They will also disclose the amount of commission and which officers and politicians were sent
 gauratlab he ki EOW ne apane chaape ke dauraan ek diary ke kuch panne saarvajanik kiye the
 These pages had the names of those influencers who received a hefty commission
 yah diary EOW ke gale kii faans ban gai he
 It is said that after the revelation of this diary, the EOW has got itself covered in the case
 haalanki EOW ke ediji mukesh gupta ke mutabik abhiyojan sweekruti milane ke baad iees tuteja or shukla kaa maamla pending main rakhaa gaya he
 He said that since the case is high-level, documents and evidence are being collected

 The role of the EOW in this case has also become questionable
 kyonki 2016 main centre sarkaar se abhiyojan kii sweekruti milane ke baad bhi aaj tak donon iees adhikariyon kii giraftaar to dur unsepuchhatacha keliye notice tak jari nahin kiya he
 In this case 18 people were accused

 4 accused have been absconding since the EOW introduced the challan

 Jail Minister Balwant Singh Ramuwalia of UP Government has attacked his own government
 mantri ne kaha ki unke vibhaag main parol dene ke liye har kaidi se 50-50 hazaar rupee ghoose lee jaati he
 There is tremendous corruption and misery here
 unke afasar or karmchaaree unka hi kahana nahin sunate
 Balwant Singh Ramuwalia has also been a minister at the center, but is accepting defeat from the system of becoming a minister in UP
 balavant singh ramuwalia punjab main bade akali netaa rahe hai
 He has good relations with Mulayam Singh Yadav who brought him to UP and made him a cabinet minister
 lekin sirf saadhe teen-chaar maheene ke andar hi vah apane vibhaag se pareshaan ho gaye
 Ramuwalia presented a poor man in front of the media at a press conference and told that his babu had cheated him of Rs 5000 in the name of making him pay his son
 ramuwalia ne kaha ki upi ke gaavon main parol dene ke kaagaz lekar sipaahi jaataa he
 He tells the housemates of the prisoner that bribe 50 thousand rupees, then i will write that by giving them parole, there will be a peaceful atmosphere like Mahatma Gandhi ji and if i do not give money, i will write that the Mahabharata in the village will come on its parole
 Will go
 " tippaniyan Ramuwalia said that most prisoners suffer from stomach ailment by drinking dirty water
 isliye vah jelon main aaro plant lagavaana chaahate the
 He ordered, but the file did not move forward and the entire budget of RO was lost
 isi tarah jelon main sisitivi lagavaana chaahate the, lekin unke staff ne file nahin badhane di
 He ordered parole to 235 prisoners but only 23 of them could proceed
 aisa kaam iske pehle kabhi nahin dekha
 Now we have to see what the government does after this attack
 Is there any improvement in the system? balavant singh ramuwalia punjab main bade akali netaa rahe hai

 Never seen such a work before

 vastu evam seva kar (guds and services tex-gst)ko lagu hue somvaar ko do saal puure ho gaye
 This system of historic tax reform came into force on July 1, 2017 in the country
 jiesti ko lekar desh main lambey samay se bahes chhidi rahi
 Even today there is a discussion about its success and failure
 pichhali modi sarkaar main jiesti lagu karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale vitt mantri arun jetali ne jiesti ke do saal puure hone par blog likhakar iske mahatv par prakaash daalaa he
 What Jaitley said in the blog, former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it was not easy to implement GST
 pichley do varshon main iske kriyanvayan kaa haal dekhne ke baad jiesti kaa uchit vishleshan ho saktaa he
 He has stated that in the federal structure both the central and state governments used to impose indirect taxes on the goods
 rajyon ke paas kai kanoon the, jo unhen alag-alag binduon par kar lagane kaa haq dete the
 In such a situation, there were major challenges in the way of implementation of GST
 sabase pehali chunauti thi rajyon ko sahamat karne kii
 Because they felt that they would lose their autonomy to tax after the GST was implemented
 duusari sabase badi chunauti thi sansad main isko lekar sahmati banane kii
 The worries of the states were resolved and agreed
 jiesti lagu hone par tex se jude sabhi 17 tarah ke kanoon ek main mil gaye
 Thus, the system of single taxation could be implemented in the country
 pehle waite shulk 14
 5 percent, Product Shukla 12
 5 pratishat dena padataa tha
 Consumers had to pay 31 percent tax including all taxes
 kai ritern daakhil karne padate the
 Many inspectors are also investigated
 magar jiesti ne is puure paridrishy ko badal diya
 Today there is only one tax, online return facility

 Prior to GST, there was a considerable impact on consumers' pockets

 janata faisla kare- koun sachcha, koun jhootharahul ne is dauraan maujuud jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki karnataka kii janata ko tay karnaa he ki unhen kis par yakeen he
 Rahul also gave him two options during this time
 unhone kaha ki 'ek taraf congress, siddharmaiya ji or main hum, jabaki duusari taraf bijepi or narendra modi hai
 'rahul called upon the public to believe the one who tells the truth, because those who lie will not benefit the people of Karnataka
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki modi ji jo vaada karte hai, use nibhaate nahin hai
 He told that Modi ji had promised to send 15 lakh rupees to the account, but not even one rupee came
 -piem modi ne har saal 2 karod rojgaar kaa vaada kiya, jab hamane sansad main sawaal kiya ki centre sarkaar ne kitne rojgaar die to unhone 24 ghante main 450 kaa aakanda diya
 In Parliament, Modi ji did not talk about the future, only kept talking about Congress and history
 vahiin, isse pehle mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki jab sonia gandhi ne bellari seat se loksabhaa chunaav main jeet darj kii to congress kii kismat badal gai
 In the same way, the Jan Ashirwad Yatra starting from Bellary will not only ensure victory in the Karnataka elections, but will also win the Congress in the 2019 general elections
 rahul yahaan sandhodhan ke baad mandiron ke darshan bhi karenge
 It is believed that Rahul wants to retain his soft Hindu image
 isliye wo dharmik sthanon kaa daura bhi karenge

 bellari se shuruyaat kyon?darasal, saal 1999 main sonia gandhi ne apana pehla chunaav bellari loksabhaa seat se hi ladaa tha
 He defeated Sushma Swaraj of BJP from this seat
 us chunaav ke dauraan rahul gandhi bhi kai dinon tak prachaar abhiyaan par rahe the
 Subsequently, this Bellary was instrumental in bringing the Congress back to power after seven years in the 2013 assembly elections
 kyonki 2010 main vipaksh ke netaa rahe siddharmaiya ne khanan mafia reddy bhaiyon ke virodh main bengaluru se bellari tak padayatra nikaali thi
 It is believed that after this padyatra, the Congress had strengthened its roots among the people
