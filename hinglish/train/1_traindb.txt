 khushi kaa aisa maahaul he jaisaa cricket main pakistan ko haraane par hota he
 The most serious writers are also said to be daringly saying that the controversial streams have been removed, now show them by saying something
 darasal kashmir main kisi dhara kaa aana-janaa jitna chintajanak nahin he, usase zyaada khataranaak yah nazariyaa he
 In the last few decades, such an atmosphere has been created in which Article 370 (which BJP calls Article 370), no constitutional provision was left, became an emotional issue on the basis of which the votes were divided and distributed in the rest of India
 jaahir he, yahi sthiti kashmir main bhi bani
 As much noise was made about Kashmir here, Kashmir moved inch and inch away
 lekin vastusthiti ko samajhane kii koshish karen
 What does it mean to end the special status of Kashmir? It is being said that now every Indian plot in Kashmir will be able to buy
 haalat ye he ki aam hindustani apane puraane ghar or makaan nahin bachaa paa rahe, ve chote shaharon ke apane khet or ghar bech kar, bainkon se lone lekar kisi tarah mahanagaron main flats le rahe hai
 They will take their second plot in Kashmir - this ridiculous idea does not make anything more than just a laughable plea
 beshak, iskaa faaydaa kuch udyogpatiyon ko milegaa or vah faaydaa risataa hua kuch kashmiriyon tak bhi pahonchega, lekin isaki qeemat kashmir or puure desh ko kya chukaani hogi- iskaa hisaab abhi lagaana mushkil he
 The government, which is claiming to end this special status on the dawn of development, should be asked that in areas where it is allowed to go and buy land, build schools, establish industries, development there What is the truth of kisaan aatmahatya ko kyon majaboor hai? noujvaan berojgaar kyon hai? bachche kuposhan se marane ko majaboor kyon hai?baharhaal, is vishyantar se bachate hue kashmir par lauten
 Was Kashmir different from the rest of India because Article 370 was applicable there? There are other such articles in other states which give special status to the local people there
 jharkhand main aap adivaasiyon kii zamin nahin kareed sakate
 Himachal is also banned from buying land
 darasal aitihaasik sachai yah he ki yah dhara 370 he jisane kashmir ko bharat se joda
 Well, it was a temporary stream, but the condition of its end was that it would be finished by the aspirations of the Kashmiris
 mana ja rahaa tha ki bhartiya loktantr jaise-jaise majboot hoga, kashmir or baaqi bharat ke bich bani yah dhara galati jaaegi or ek din bemaani hokar bhula di jaaegi
 Ramchandra Guha in his book 'india After Gandhi' has mentioned that in the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir, Sheikh Abdullah talked about the three options for Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki kashmir jis tarah kii taaqaton se ghira he, unhen dekhte hue vah azaad nahin rah saktaa
 He rejected the option of moving to Pakistan on the grounds that the feudal lords and landlords would not leave Kashmir
 sheikh abdulla ne kaha ki unhen nehru se ummid he ki vah apane yahaan kii kathmullah taaqaton ko parrast kar sakenge or kashmir kaa bhavishya bharat main he
 Guha's book also states that it was Sheikh Abdullah who gave the slogan from Kashmir to Kanyakumari that is still used to demonstrate the unity of India
 aane vaale dinon main is vishwaas ko kis tarah kuchlaa gaya, yah ek lambii or dardanaak kahani he
 Its villains are many - the Sangh Parivar who sent Shyama Prasad Mukherjee to the movement there, also the Congress, who spent a lot of time in the name of elections there and put up their puppets and also the leaders of Kashmir who have done separatism and terrorism Turned into a profitable business
 lekin puraani aitihaasik galatiyon ko nai aitihaasik galatiyon se sudhaarney kii zid bataati he ki loktantr ke itane saare baras biit jane ke baad bhi aap yah nahin samaj paae hai ki desh kaise banate hai or raashtra kaise majboot hote hai
 They are made by public dreams, not by law streams
 jammu-kashmir main pichley kuch dinon main jis tarah kaa sarkari tantra chalaa, usase lagata he jaise ham apane hi desh ke ek barabari vaale hisse ke saath nahin, kisi upnivesh ke saath pesh aa rahe hai
 100 years ago, just as the British government dealt with Indians, the Indian government could not deal with Indians
 ek rajya ke netaaon ko najarband karke, bina kisi uksaave ke rajya main dhara 144 lagu karke, rajya ke ek hisse main skool college band karakar agar aap koi faisalaa karte hai to isliye ki aapako pataa hota he ki vah faisalaa janata ke gale nahin utarane vaala he
 But you do not try to convince people, connect with you, try to impose your judgment on them and do something in such a way that the rest of India flaunts it
 aisa karke darasal aap kashmir ko kuch or dur hi kar rahe hote hai
 The alarming thing is that the government is not taking care of public opinion nor legal obligations in trying to remove Article 370
 sanvaidhanik sthiti yah he ki ise kashmir kii samvidhan sabha kii ijazat ke bina nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 The government first issued a notification and delegated the powers of the Constituent Assembly to the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly
 iskaa tark phir bhi samajha ja saktaa he kyonki ab vahaan samvidhan sabha kaa astitv hi nahin bachaa he
 But the central government's argument ahead of this is interesting
 vah kahati he ki chunki abhi vidhansabha nahin he isliye uski shaktiyaan loksabhaa main nihit hai or loksabhaa uski ore se faisalaa kar sakati he
 It is difficult to say whether this argument will survive any judicial review
 baharhaal, kashmir kaa hal aasaan nahin he, uski apni jatiltaayen hai
 But the only lesson in history is that such problems are solved not by coercion, but ultimately by dialogue, not by holding the public's collar, and by holding their hands
 in panktiyon kaa lekhak kashmir kaa visheshgy nahin he
 But one does not have to be an expert of Kashmir to understand that if such big decisions are not taken with the people, then they turn into new crises
 jo vaaki algaavvaadi hai, unhen bhi yah faisalaa koob raas aayega kyonki isse usee prachaar ko bal milegaa jo ve barason se kar rahe hai
 The need to be more expert to understand this is even less that the emotional atmosphere about the changes in Kashmir must have made Kashmir somewhat sad and depressed
 darasal aap na hindustan se pyaar karte hai na kashmir se- aap ek nakli deshbhakti se pyaar karte hai jisamen naaron kaa shor zyaada hota he, sachai kam
 In an article written years ago on Fascism, Umberto Eco said that freedom of expression also means freedom from 'rhetoric' - verbiage
 lekin ham shabdadambaron kii azaadi main hi magan hai
 Milan Kundera had described the atmosphere after the departure of Soviet soldiers in Prague as 'carnival of Hate' - this festival of hatred about Kashmir can be seen everywhere
 kahana mushkil he ki kashmir ko zyaada nuqasaan kis baat se pahonchega- kashmir main dhara 370 hataane se, yaa baaki bharat main bah rahi kushi kii dhara se
 Thailand's Supreme Court on Tuesday sentenced former Prime Minister Thaksin Sinawatra to prison for two years in a case of misuse of power as prime minister
 samachar agency dipie ke anusaar sinawatra par aarope tha ki unhone pradhanmantri pad kaa durupyog karte hue ek sarkari bhoomi kii nilaamee main apni patni poojaman ko jameen kharidne kii anumati di thi

" ' isse pehle america raashtrapati ne kaha tha ki modi kii duusari pari ke tahat bharat-america ranneetik sambandhon ke liye kaaphi chijen hai

 jab bhi bharat main tivi ke sabase popular shoj kaa zikr hoga, top list main 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma' kaa bhi naam aayega
 The praise of this show is less
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki 10 saal se chal rahe is sho ne tivi kii duniya main ek alag hi mukaam hasil kiya he
 Like this, every single character of Taarak Mehta's inverted glasses has left a deep impression on the hearts and minds of people
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se sho ko dekhne ke baad aisa lag rahaa he ki ye sho dhire-dhire apana charm kho rahaa he
 Apparently, the popularity of the show is fading these days
 sho main chal rahaa plot phens ko prabhavit karte main asafal najar aa rahaa he
 The fall in TRP is another matter
 lekin sochane vaali baat yah he aisa ho kyon rahaa he? puure parivaar ko ek saath 8
 The show, which was forced to sit in front of the television at 30 pm, is now proving to be ineffective
 haalanki, sho ko beete dinon main kai jatke lage hai
 The disappearance of the show's famed character Dayaben (disha Vakani) for a year and a half, the sudden death of actor Kavi Kumar Azad playing the role of Doctor Elephant, Sonu's role playing actress Nidhi Bhanushali's leaving the show are some of the points that made the serial Has impacted
 sho ke mekars jaise-taise jugad main lage hai ki ise downfall se bachaaya jaae
 But the effort that is currently appearing in the episodes of the show is insufficient
 sho main ghise-pite plot dikhaae ja rahe hai
 Sometimes it seems like the show is deviating from its tag line 'hasante Rahe, Khush Rahe'
 pehle sho main har function ko behad shandaar tareeke se dikhaaya jaataa tha, isamen majaa bhi aata tha, magar ab sho kii script main panch najar nahin aate hai
 Earlier, each and every dialogue of the serial used to be forced to laugh, now in the whole episode, you have to find a dialogue to laugh
 beete dinon sho main kai betuke se plot dikhaae gaye
 Forced things are being pulled of rubber
 outdoor tour ke naam par kirdaaron kaa singapore jaise shahar main ghoomane kaa plot bhi thanda sabit hua
 Now even the track of Popatlal's wedding and dream is looking lifeless
 do-teen kirdaaron kaa sho se gaayab hona, jaise serial kii hansi kaa kahin gaayab ho janaa maaloom pad rahaa he
 In the situation like the show, it is very difficult for serial producer Asit Modi to keep his fans tied
 jis tarah se sho kii storiline chal rahi he, use dekhakar yah bhi ashanka he ki dayaban kii vaapasi bhi kahin beasar na sabit ho jaae
 In this era of competition, it has become necessary for Asit Modi to innovate to save the show
 kyonki tivi par in dinon or bhi kai sho kadi takkar dene ke liye khadey hai or aise main darshak aasaani se duusare shoj kii taraf shift ho jaataa he
 If seen, the script of the show needs to be changed in time so that Tarak Mehta can retain his charm and keep the taste of entertainment for the hardcore audience who like it

 The problem of Naxalism is increasing continuously at the national level throughout India
 naksalwad ek vichaardhaara he or is vichaardhaara ko maanane vaale ab loktantr par hamalaa karne main lage hai, jisase bhartiya loktantr khatre main he
 Examples of this are the incidents of Naxalite attack of Jhiramghati on 11 March 2014 and earlier on 25 May 2013
 pichley saal kii ghatana main chhattisgarh pradesh ke sheershasth congressi netagan mahendra karma, nand kumaar patel, vidyacharan shukla samet 32 log shahid hue the
 Due to this the whole country was in mourning
 is ghatana se puure desh main log dare-sahame najar aae
 In such an odd situation, our family showed patience
 hindustan ke jin pradeshon main naksalwad kii samasya he, vahaan kii sarkarein is samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye kya soch rahi hai yah mujhe nahin maaloom, par meraa yah maananaa he ki jin rajyon main naksalwad kii samasya he, vahaan sarkaron ko kshetra main vikaas kii ranneeti ke tahat shiksha, rojgaar or moolbhoot suvidhaayen deni chahie
 Naxalites spread their wings only in areas where their geographical location is suitable and the population there is illiterate
 aaj kii sthiti bahut avishwasaneey he
 The population of the remote region seeks the government
 unhen sarkaar to nahin milti par bihadon main naksali aasaani se jarur mil jate hai
 i believe that every last person of India should reach the government so that Naxalism is over
 naksalwad kaa uddeshy shashan ke viruddh janayuddh kii pariklpana thi
 Today it only means raising funds and looting weapons by attacking police forces
 naksali chaahate hai ki adivasee anpadh hi rahen or tarakkee na karen
 These intentions of Naxalites are being considered as local tribals
 isi baat ko lekar pichley saalon main naksaliyon ke bich bahari naksali or sthaneey naksali kaa mudda uthaa tha
 Now tribals have also understood that Naxalism has nothing to do with it
 padosi rajya ke aaayaatit naksali yahaan ke adivaasiyon ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 The Naxalites, who claim themselves to be tribals friendly, have been taking out donations only in the tribal areas of Bastar division for the last 40 years
 ab to ve yahaan ke mehanatakash adivaasiyon se hi tex vasuulne lage hai
 To intimidate the tribals and to join them and to give their children to wear Naxal uniforms at a young age, their mood is exposed
 saal ke har sijan main ugaahi / chanda karne ke vaaste inke liye adivasee bahulakshetra acha market sabit ho rahaa he
 By taking the name of water, forest and land, these tribals are constantly tricking and exploiting them
 chaahe vah tendupatta sijan ho yaa doosraa sijan, har kisi kii kamai kaa kuch hissaa naksaliyon ko dena hi padataa he
 Most of the Naxalite affected areas in the country are in tribal areas, where mineral wealth and natural resources are abundant
 in par bhi naksaliyon kii giddh drushti he
 At first, they oppose the industries set up in these areas and later Naxalites keep receiving donations from these industries
 yah desh ke prajatantr or aantarik suraksha ke liye nasoor he
 Timely solution is very important
 mere papa ji (swa
 Mahendra Karma) used to say, "I win or lose in politics but i will always fight the Naxalites
" meraa maananaa he ki naksal samasya ke samaadhaan main koi raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 "talking about gaining power at gunpoint in such a large democratic country shows the mental insanity of the Naxalites
" naksali vichaardhaara se ittefaq rakhane vaale kai buddhijiviyon ne ‘‘salwa judum’’ or green hunt aadi ko sabhy samaaj ke saamne galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he, jisase vah apane anjaam tak pahunchane se pehle hi dam tod chukaa he
 Whereas both the above campaigns were started to get the innocent tribesmen out of misleading naxalites
 naksalwad ke samaadhaan ke rup main sarvapratham naksalwad ke prachaar prasar ko rokane or unke safedposh samarthakon, shahari network tathaa sthaneey madadgaaron par ankush lagaae jane kii jarurat he
 The current laws against Naxalism are insufficient
 naksal prabhavit kshetron main central police kii saikadon companiyaan hai magar sattadhari party ke naksali unmoolan kii ichhashakti ke abhaav main defensive mod main hi hai
 Due to this, the Naxalite problem is constantly increasing, along with the morale of the Central Police is also falling
 iskaa phayda naksali uthaa rahe hai
 If the state government had taken effective steps towards eradicating Naxalite from the beginning, then such a big incident would not have happened in Jeeram Valley last year and then last week
 kai bade naksali to punarvaas niti (serender policy) kaa bhi phayda uthaa rahe hai
 Many Naxalites see this as a retirement plan
 jiskaa plan acha laga uske saamne jaakar sarender kar diya
 Nowadays, the big Naxalites are taking advantage of this
 naksal prabhavit kshetron main police or prashasnic vyavastha ko eemaandaaree se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 At the same time, the people's representatives elected by the people should also play an important role in eradicating Naxalites

 anusuchit jati-janajati (SC / ST) adhinium maamle par elahabaad hoicourt kii lakhanu bench ne bada aadesh diya he
 The SC / ST Act or other law which carries seven years of imprisonment or less, has expressed displeasure at the routine arrest of the accused
 court ne kaha ki arpisi ke praavdhaanon kaa paalan kiye bagaiyr ekadalitamahila or uski beti par hamale ke aaropee chaar logon ko giraftaar nahin kar sakati he
 The High Court cited a 2014 judgment of the Supreme Court that in cases of punishment less than 7 years, the accused should be called for questioning by giving notice before arrest
 aropit agar notice kii sharton kaa paalan karata he to use vivechna ke dauraan giraftaar nahin kiya jayega
 The court said that in such cases it has ordered to follow sections 41 and 41A of the crpc
 sidhe giraftaar tab hi sambhav he jab yah aavashyak ho
 Explain that the bench of Justice Ajay Lamba and Justice Sanjay Harkauli of the High Court said these things during the hearing of the petition seeking to quash an FIR filed on August 19 after the Central Government Ordinance in the SC / ST Act
 ye yachika gonda ke candare thane main rajesh mishra ke khilaaf marpet, SC / ST act ke maamle main hui giraftaar ko radd karne ke liye daayar kii gai thi
 The High Court said that before the arrest in this case, the 2014 judgment given by the Supreme Court in the case of Arneesh Kumar v
 State of Bihar should be followed
 isi ke saath court ne yachika ko nistarit kar diya
 The Supreme Court ruled in the Anresh Kumar case that if the FIR lodged against someone carries a maximum sentence of offense up to seven years, then the provisions of crpc 41 and 41A will be followed in such a case

 Following the Election Commission's order against NDA Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the Gujarat government has registered two firs
 chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki modi ne janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii do dhaaraon 126 (1)(a) or 126 (1) (b) ke ulanghan kiya he
 Earlier, the Congress had complained to the Election Commission that the way the press conference was held after Narendra Modi cast his vote in Gandhinagar was a violation of the model code of conduct
 lihaaza unke khilaaf exiaar darj kii jaae
 The Election Commission took immediate action on this complaint
 saath hi gujarat sarkaar ko yah nirdesh bhi diya tha ki vah shaam 6 baje tak suchit kare ki kya karrwai kii gai he
 The Election Commission also asked to register an FIR against the TV channels showing Modi's press conference
 narendra modi ne is par tikhi pratikriya di he
 He has said that for the first time in his life, there has been an FIR against him and he will never forget this day
 modi ne kaha ki agar koi chaaku, pistaul yaa bandook se dhamkaae to uske khilaaf exiaar samaj main aati he, lekin unke khilaaf exiaar isliye darj hui, kyonki unhone logon ko camel kaa phool dikhaaya
 For this, they have attacked the Congress
 modi ne tirupati main ek chunavi raily main kaha ki congress chaay bechney vaale dar gai he
 Not even once did Modi name the Election Commission and blamed Congress directly for the FIR
 bijepi ne congress dwaara kiye gaye sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke kathith apmaan ko is chunaav main ek bada mudda banaaya he
 In its charge sheet against the UPA government, the BJP has accused the Congress of tampering with organizations like CVC, CAG and Election Commission
 yahi vajah he ki modi apane khilaaf exiaar ko lekar chunaav ayog ke saamne khadey hote nahin dikhnaa chaahate hai
 However, in his initial phase in Gujarat, he has lost two hands to the Election Commission
 rajya main 2002 main chunaavon main deree ke liye unhone tatkaaleen mukhya chunaav ayukta jeem lingadoh par nishane saadhe the
 But BJP leaders are definitely questioning the action and speed of the Election Commission
 haalanki vah khulkar is bare main zyaada kuch kehane ko taiyaar nahin he
 According to party leaders, Narendra Modi has not violated the model code of conduct
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki modi ne patrakaron se baatcheet poling booth se do sau meter dur kii thi
 As far as the press conference is concerned, it is common that all the leaders interact with the journalists after casting their votes
 suraksha ke lihaaj se modi ke liye alag se intjaam kiya gaya tha, jise press confeence kaa naam dena thik nahin hoga
 Modi spoke on political issues only when reporters were asked questions about it
 bijepi netaa yah bhi kehete hai ki chunaav chinh camel ko kurte par lagaana aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin he
 He argues that unless an election symbol is requested to vote on it, it cannot be considered a violation of the Code
 poling booth par raajnneetik dalon ke agent chunaav chinh laga kar baith sakate hai
 Aam Aadmi Party workers and leaders go to vote by putting a broom hat symbol, while Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh shake hands after casting their vote, which is their party's election symbol
 bijepi janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii un dhaaraon main ullekith 'chunaav saamagree' shabd kii vyakhya par bhi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 The party says that at the time of releasing its manifesto, questions were also raised under the same wording and that the media was asked to stop telecasting, whereas any political party can issue its manifesto at any time
 haalanki kanoon ke jaankaar bijepi ke aitraaj ko khaarij kar rahe hai
 According to him, the Election Commission had said in an order on 9 April that no one could visit a polling booth in a hat, shawl or clothes bearing the election symbol of a political party
 modi ne vot daalane ke baad raajnneetik bayaan die jinhen tivi par dikhaaya or isse matadaata prabhavit ho sakate hai
 Modi held the BJP election symbol in his hand the whole time and kept waving, which would be called propagating the party in a way
 vaise to janpratinidhitiv kanoon kii in dhaaraon ke ulanghan par do saal kii sazaa tak kaa praavdhaan he
 But such cases are rare in which it is punished
 isliye yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki is maamle main aage ja kar modi ke khilaaf kya karrwai hoti he
 It is sure that Modi has benefited from this controversy in a way, because on the polling day, he dominated the TV and he was also waving his election symbol Lotus

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described the benefits of demonetisation and GST as its achievements
 ajtak ke saath exclusive intervyuu main piem modi ne kaha ki notebandi ne kaledhan par sabase bada hamalaa bolaa he or tex main ijapha hua he
 When PM Modi was questioned that your opponents call demonetisation as the biggest lapse
 kya aap notebandi ko sabase badi kamyaabi maanate hai yaa phir chook maanate hai?is par piem modi ne kaha, 'maine notebandi chunaav jeetne ke liye nahin kii thi
 Although the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections were fought over the issue of our anti-demonetisation, the public slapped them in such a way that they do not take the name of demonetisation
 'unhone kaha ki ab bhi vipakshi netaa notebandi ko lekar kabhi-kabhi ro padate hai, kyonki notebandi kii vajah se unka sabakuch lut gaya he
 After demonetisation, notes came out in sacks from the house of ministers and babus
 notebandi se ek lakh 30 hajaar karod rupee ujagar hue
 He said that we seized benami properties worth more than Rs 50 thousand crore
 teen lakh se zyada farji companiyon par taala gaya diya, jisase ek-ek kamare main chal rahaa arabon or kharbon kaa kaarobaar band ho gaya
 Counting the benefits of demonetisation, PM Modi said that it has doubled the tax rate after so many years of independence
 isaki vajah yah thi ki notebandi ke baad logon ko laga ki ab kaale dhandhe or kaledhan se desh main kaam chalanaa mushkil he
 So one should walk on the path of honesty
 notebandi ne kaledhan par itnaa bada hamalaa bolaa he ki desh kii maansikta main bahut bada badlaav aayaa
 The economy also benefited a lot from this
 isse mudrasphiti bhi kam hui he
 Demonetisation has brought awareness among the people and black money keepers are being caught
 piem modi ne kaha ki unke kaarykaal main mahangaai kaa naa badhanaa majboot arthvyavastha kaa pratik he
 The rise in inflation was also due to UPA being out of power in 2014
 modi ne notebandi or jiesti ke amal par apni sarkaar kii aalochana ko sire bhi se khaarij kar diya
 PM Modi expressed complete satisfaction about the management of the economy
 jab unase kaha gaya ki vipakshi dal aarope lagaate hai ki notebandi, kisaanon kii samasya or jiesti se mudda bhatakaane ke liye piem modi sargical strike or balakot air strike kii charchaa karte hai
 On this, PM Modi said, 'if every speech of mine will be seen, then i speak in them on farmers, electricity, road and also on the issue of national security
 agar meraa 40 minute kaa bhaashan hota he, to main 3 se 4 minute suraksha ke mudde par bolta hum
 He said that the security of the country cannot be ignored
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue piem modi ne kaha ki congress senadhyaksh ko sadak kaa gunda kahati he
 He questioned that why did the Congress ignore the issue of security? On the question of Mudra Yojana, PM Modi said, “under the Mudra Yojana, four and a half crore people got loan from the bank for the first time
 ' rojgaar ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki agar sadak banati he or vikaas hota he, to kya bina rojgaar ke sadak banati he? unhone kaha ki do iti companiyon ne haal main kaha ki unhone 400 guna logon ko naukari di he

 But it seems that this time the world trade fair will remain dull, because these days the capital is in the grip of dense smog and severe pollution

 Due to the double pollutionmog at Pragati Maidan, the air of Delhi has been poisoned earlier, while due to the ongoing construction work at Pragati Maidan, the pollution inside Pragati Maidan will be much more
 vaise to construction citon ko dhankane ke liye pragati maidan main jagah jagah par oonchi oonchi bericating lagaai gai hai
 Despite this, due to the continuous construction, more pollution may have to be faced than usual, which will be a big challenge for the people who visit the fair this time of pollution season

 Delhi's air-wind is equally bad and in such a situation, if construction work is going on in large part of the field, then people should be prepared to face more pollution than usual during the trade fair

 Bihar has a coalition government and it is a coincidence of this government that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav, who have been fiercely opposed to each other for nearly 20 years, are allies in power
 pehali baar, lalu yadav ne nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan kaa netaa mana
 It seems that this step had to be taken due to his political compulsion
 lekin shanivaar ko ek nae navele channel ne apane kulaase main ek jamaane main sivaan ke don or ab purv saansad mohammad shahabuddin or unke party ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke baatcheet kaa ansh dikhaaya he
 Shahabuddin is complaining to Lalu Yadav, SP of Siwan, Sourav Shah
 iske alaava do or audio clip hai jisamen shahabuddin apane samarthakon se baatcheet kar rahe hai or ek clip main bidio ko auqaat dikhaane kii baat kar rahe hai
 The political storm has definitely started from Delhi to Patna with this audio clip going public
 is baat me koi andeh nahin ki lalu yadav ke kattar samarthakon ke paas bhi is baat kaa koi tark nahin ki akhir lalu yadav kii kya majaburi he ki vah shahabuddin jaise sajayafata logon se baat karte hai
 However, Lalu Yadav has been found guilty in the fodder scam and is running out on bail
 agar lalu yadav kii baatcheet galat or gaiyrkanoonee thi tab saath-saath ye bhi sach he ki ye bihar kii police he jo jail main band kukhyat, sajayaftaa aparaadhiyon ke upar unke mobile phone ko recording par rakhti he or shahabuddin bhale sattarudh gathbandhan ke netaa hon, lekin unke prati police ne koi narmi nahin barti
 But everyone knows that all the problems of Lalu Yadav have happened so far due to patronizing the wrong people or by calling someone in the lobby
 mana jaataa he ki lalu yadav apni aadat se sudharne vaale nahin, isi kaaran unki mushkilen khatm nahin ho raheen
 Opposition BJP leader Sushil Modi alleges that Nitish Kumar no longer takes a strong stand due to his alliance with Lalu Yadav
 haalanki bhaajapa ke netaa maanate hai ki nitish kumaar ne satta main aane ke baad 2005 se aparaadhiyon khaaskar shahabuddin jaise kukhyat aparaadhiyon ke kilaaf wo chaahe vishesh court banane kaa nirnay ho yaa spidi trial kaa, un faisale ke kaaran naa keval aadhe darjan se adhik maamalon main doshi qaraar hue balki raajnneetik haisiyat kii ye durgati hui kii 2005 november ke chunaav ke baad loksabhaa or vidhansabha to dur kii baat he nagarpalika chunaav main bhi shahabuddin apane samarthakon ko apane prabhaav se nahin jeeta pate
 Before Lalu, Nitish came together, the notion was going on that if Shahabuddin's hand is on you in the politics of Siwan, the defeat is certain because the vote was polarized
 ye baat kisi ke samaj se dur he ki jis sivaan jail main ek jamaane main jailer shahabuddin ko kursi dete the usee jail main bihar police ke ek adhikari ne unki pitayee is had tak kar daali ki aaj tak rajd ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki qamar ke dard se wo ubar nahin paae hai
 Apart from this, raids in the jail, especially in his ward, were common
 mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad ek baar phir jab jail main darbar lagane laga or uske photo viral hue tab jail ke adhikariyon par gaaj giri
 Shahabuddin blames Nitish Kumar for his political misdemeanor and so after getting out of jail last year, he first targeted Nitish Kumar by saying that he is the leader of the circumstances and everyone knows that Shahabuddin is going to go back to jail
 a statement played the most role
 baad main sarvocch nyaayalay main jab tihaar jail bhejne kaa maamla aayaa tab rajya sarkaar ne apni sahmati dene main koi der nahin kii
 It is different that Lalu has remained silent on the statement made by Shahabuddin on Nitish due to his politics and his favor to Shahabuddin till date
 tippaniyan Shahabuddin, if Lalu Yadav calls and complains about someone, there are many political reasons behind it, but the most prominent is the 7 days of 2000 when Nitish Kumar's government was formed for the same number of days and many Congress mlas for Nitish Had made up his mind to change his face
 adhikansh vidhayak ko patna ke ek hotel main tehraaya gaya tha or us samay shahabuddin ke upar un vidhayakon kii nigaraanee or nitish ke yojana ko vifal karne kaa zimmaa diya gaya tha
 It is not hidden from anyone that Shahabuddin had collected his pro-criminals from all over the country for this work and then his self-styled officers of Lalu Yadav more than his uniform in Patna Police helped him in this work
 nitish sarkaar ko janaa padaa or shahabuddin ke saamne lalu yadav natmastak ho gaye ye silsilaa aaj bhi jari he
 But the truth of today's Bihar politics is that Siwan has the same Superintendent of Police whom Shahabuddin is saying is finished and BDO also occupies his post, only the transfer of SDO has happened due to his promotion
 ye tathy nitish, lalu or shahabuddin teenon ke sambandh or unki raajnneetik haisiyat aaj ke bihar main bayaan karti he
 The political storm has definitely started from Delhi to Patna with this audio clip going public

 ye tathy nitish, lalu or shahabuddin teenon ke sambandh or unki raajnneetik haisiyat aaj ke bihar main bayaan karti he
 If Lalu Yadav's conversation was inaccurate and illegal, then it is also true that it is the police of Bihar who keep their mobile phones on record on the infamous, convicted criminals jailed and Shahabuddin may be the leader of the ruling coalition
 But the police did not show any kindness towards them
 lekin sab jaanate hai ki lalu yadav kii sari mushkilon main adhikansh galat logon ko sangrakshan dene ke kaaran yaa pairvi main kisi ko phone laga dene ke kaaran ab tak hui hai
 It is believed that Lalu Yadav is not going to improve with his habit, that is why his difficulties are not ending
 vipakshi bhaajapa ke netaa susheel modi kaa aarope he ki nitish kumaar ab lalu yadav ke saath gathbandhan ke kaaran sakht rukh nahin akhtiyaar karte
 However, BJP leaders believe that since 2005, after Nitish Kumar came to power, the decision to set up a special court or speedy trial against notorious criminals like Shahabuddin, especially in more than half a dozen cases
 It was a mistake in the political status rather that the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha are far away after the November 2005 elections
 The discharge also find Shahabuddin won their supporters from their influence
 lalu, nitish ke ek saath aane se pehle ye dharna ghar karti ja rahi thi ki agar sivaan kii raajnneeti main aapke upar shahabuddin kaa haath he to haar nishchit he kyonki voton kaa dhruvikaran ho jataa tha
 It is far from anyone's understanding that in the same jail where jailer once gave a chair to Shahabuddin, a Bihar police officer beat him to the extent that even today RJD leaders believe that the waist He has not recovered from the pain
 iske alaava jail main khaaskar unke ward main chhapemari aam baat ho gai thi
 After the formation of the Grand Alliance government once again, when the court began to be held in the jail and its photos went viral, the officers of the jail were in awe
 shahabuddin apni is raajnneetik durgati ke liye nitish kumaar ko doshi maanate hai or isaliye pichley saal jail se nikalne ke baad unhone pehla nishaanaa nitish kumaar par ye kah kar saadhaa ki wo paristhitiyon ke netaa hai or sab jaanate hai ki shahabuddin ke waapas jail jane main is ek vaktavy ne sabase adhik bhoomika nibhaai
 Later, when the matter of sending the Tihar jail to the Supreme Court came, the state government did not delay in giving its consent
 ye baat alag he ki shahabuddin dwaara nitish par die gaye vaktavy par lalu aaj tak maun hai jo unki raajnneeti or abhi tak shahabuddin ke prati unke ehsaan ke kaaran hai
 The comments shahabuddin, agar lalu yadav ko phone kar kisi kii shikaayat yaa fariyaad karte hai to uske peeche kai raajnneetik kaaran hai lekin sabase pramukh he 2000 ke wo 7 din jab nitish kumaar kii itane hi dinon kii sarkaar bani thi or congress ke kai vidhayak nitish ke liye apana paala badalane kaa man bana chuke the
 Most of the mlas were stationed at a hotel in Patna and Shahabuddin was then supervised by those mlas and tasked with thwarting Nitish's plan
 ye baat kisi se chhipi nahin ki shahabuddin ne is kaam ke liye puure desh se apane samarthak aparaadhiyon ko jamaa kiya tha or tab patna police main apni vardi se zyaada lalu yadav ke prati unke swajaateey nishthavan adhikariyon ne is kaam main unki madad kii
 Nitish Sarkar had to go and Lalu Yadav bowed down in front of Shahabuddin, the process continues even today
 lekin aaj kii bihar kii raajnneeti kii sachaai he ki sivaan main vahi police adheekshak hai jinhen shahabuddin khatm bataa rahe hai or bidio bhi apane pad par virajman he keval esadio kaa tabadalaa uske pramotion hone ke kaaran hua he
 This fact speaks about the relationship of Nitish, Lalu and Shahabuddin and their political status in today's Bihar

 The AAP workers present at the protest said that Delhi is a half-finished state, due to which the government of Delhi does not have all the powers and hence Delhi is not getting full development

 Sushma said, 'I have introduced a private bill in this regard

 2012 main selectors ne sachin tendulkar ko bhartiya team se hataae jane par charchaa kii thi
 Patil said, 'we met Sachin Tendulkar in December 2012 and talked to him on his future plans
 sachin ke dimag main tab ritairement kii baat nahin thi
 But then a consensus was reached on Sachin in the selection committee and the board was also informed
 tab tak sachin ke samaj main aa chukaa tha ki selectors kya chaahate hai or agali meeting main unhone vanade se ritairement lene kii baat kah di

 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamen mahasoos hua ki nae captain ko kuch samay diya janaa chahie
 Keeping the World Cup in mind, we retained Dhoni as the captain
 meraa maananaa he ki viraat ko sahi samay par captaini mili
 Virat can also lead the team in smaller format but now it will have to be decided by the new selection committee
 ’‘dhoni ke sanyas ke elaan se hairaani’patil ne dhoni ke test se sanyas lene ke faisle ko hairaan karne vaala bataaya kyonki team australia main tab jujh rahi thi

 The incident took place around 8 am local time
 nesanalist congress party (ensipi) ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne march se lekar ab tak rahul gandhi se teen baar mulaakaat kii he
 For the first time in 15 years, they are sitting face to face with a Congress president and talking alone
 maharashtra main 9 july ko hue dwivarshik rajya vidhaan parishad chunaavon main unhone congress ko ek atirikt seat 'uphaar' ke rup main di thi
 This reflects Pawar's uneasiness of being relevant in Maharashtra politics
 ve sambhawatah aagaamee loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle congress ke saath gathbandhan kar lenaa chaahate hai
 The ncp's fortunes have been on the slope for some time, after beating out all but one of the recent major elections
 vidhaan parishad chunaavon main bhi ensipi samarthit nirdaleey ummidavaar sandip bedse nasik main shivasena ke ashok darade se haar gaye kyonki party ke hi puraane kaddavar netaa chagan bhujabal ne daraade ko samarthan diya tha
 From encouraging peasants and Dalits against the Devendra Fadnavis government to playing the card of caste politics, Pawar did every trick to revive his party
 par philhal unka koi bhi daanv-pech kaam nahin kar rahaa
 Last December, he called upon farmers to discontinue their tax payments until the government fulfills its promise to waive debt and increase the purchase price of crops
 26 janvari ko, ensipi ke is kaddavar netaa ne or neeche jhukate hue anya dalon ke duusare or tisare str ke netaaon ke saath mumbai main ek raily ko sambodhit kiya
 In March, in a TV conversation with Raj Thackeray, Pawar supported the MNS president's assertion that Gujaratis were dominating the Marathas in Mumbai
 pichley maheene hi unhone pune ke brahmanon ko, unki pahchaan paramparaagat pagadi pahanane se inkaar karke naaraaz kar diya
 Political observers also believe that Pawar is pitting the leaders of his own party against each other
 unhone bhujabal ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye rajya vidhaan parishad main vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main marathavada ke ek yuva obisi netaa dhananjay munde kaa samarthan kiya
 But later he ensured that the other Maratha leaders abstained from the election of the local body constituency (a constituency in which representatives of local corporations elect the Legislative Council candidate) and blamed Munde's head for this defeat
 ensipi ke saamne apana kunba bachaae rakhane kii bhi chunauti he
 In June, Niranjan Davkhare, the son of Vasant Dawkhare, a young legislator from Thane and close to Pawar, joined the BJP
 dowkhre kaa daawa tha ki kai anya netaa bhi party chhodie ko taiyaar baithe hai
 In such a situation, Pawar feels that the only way to save the NCP is to join hands with the Congress
 lekin maharashtra congress ke adhyaksh ashok chavaan gathbandhan ke paksh main to dikhte hai, par rajya ke navaniyukt congress prabharee mallikarjun khadeye chavaan kii raay se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Mumbai analyst Hemant Desai says that Pawar wants to open all his horses before kneeling

 Significantly, on Monday, BSP chief Mayawati announced to contest all the 11 seats alone in the by-election in UP
 dhyaan ho ki uttarapradesh main samaajawaadee party ko maatr 5 siten ai hai or pichley chunaav main ek bhi siten na jeet paane vaali bispi ko 10 siten mil gayi
 After this result, inside the Samajwadi Party, it was discussed inside that the bsp's vote has not been transferred to the SP
 is baat kii ashankaspa ke sansthapakamulaayam singh yadavane pehle hi jataa di thi or unki baat sahi sabit hui
 Significantly, despite the alliance with the BSP, the Samajwadi Party has got only five seats
 itnaa hi nahin sapa ke durg kahe jane vaale kannauj, badaayun or firozabad main parivaar ke sadsy chunaav haar gaye
 Many people also say that in the seat sharing of the alliance, Mayawati took the seats as per her wish
 voton ke adaan-pradaan ke lahaze se dekhen to jin 10 siton par basapa ne jeet darj kii he, vahaan sapa 2014 main duusare sthaan par thi
 This is why the SP failed
 nagina, bijanour, shravasti, gajipur siton par sapa ke paksh main sameekaran tha
 The second reason is that the chemistry of the alliance did not reach the ground
 sabhaaon main bheed dekhakar inhen laga ki hamaare vot ek-duusare ko transafar ho jaaenge
 But this did not happen
 " mayawati ko yah maaloom tha ki muslim votaron par mulaayam kii vajah se sapa kii acchhee pakad he
 Mayawati benefited from this
 mayawati ne jeetne vaali siten apane khate main le lee
 In many seats, the BSP candidates lost by a very small margin

 aadhi siten duusare dal ko dene se us kshetra vishesh main us dal ke jila yaa blaak stareey netaaon ko apana bhavishya andhakaarmay dikhne laga
 "the result of all this is that sp's vote percentage is 22 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 35 pratishat se ghatakar is baar 17
 It was 96 percent
 vot pratitshat basapa kaa bhi gata, lekin uske vot siton main badal gaye

 pehle half main mujhe lag rahaa tha shaayad film bina interval ke hi dikhaai ja rahi he or khatm hone vaali he, lekin afsos, interval hua
 
 
 If anyone could save the film to some extent, it was the acting of the characters
 
 
 mere hisaab se film ko kuch gati dene ke liye kuch or masala daalane kii zarurat thi
 
 
 Director Rajkumar Gupta wanted to do a comedy film for the first time, but according to me has not been successful
 
 
 meri ore se film kii reating he - 2
 5 stars
 
 
 imran film main rajesh ke saath milakar bank lutate hai or faisla kiya jaataa he ki paison kaa bantwaaraa teen maheene baad kiya jayega, lekin inhen teen maheenon ke dauraan imran kaa accident ho jaataa he, jisamen unki yaaddaasht chali jaati he
 
 
 He also forgets where he has kept the loot money, and that is where the struggle to find money begins
 
 
 tippaniyan First of all, in the promos and promotions, 'ghanachakkar' was described as a comedy, so some similar expectations were raised by it, but the film did not make me laugh much
 
 
 mere hisaab se film kii script or screenple kaaphi kamazor he, isliye film mujhe lambii bhi lagi
 
 
 In the first half i felt that perhaps the film is being shown without an interval and is about to end, but alas, the interval happened
 
 
 film ko agar koi kuch had tak bachaa paaya to vah tha kirdaaron kaa abhinay
 
 
 According to me, the film needed some more spice to give it some momentum
 
 
 diarector rajkumaar gupta ne pehali baar kamedi film kerani chaahi, lekin mere hisaab se kaamyaab nahin ho paae hai
 
 
 The film's rating from me is - 2
 5 star

 While sharing the video, CGTN wrote - 'A girl gets stuck in the balcony playing games
 balakani kii railing main bacchee kii gardan funs gai
 In the short clip, it can be seen that the eyes of two people passing out read on the girl and they climb into the building and save her
 log un do shaks kii khub tarif kar rahe hai
 The name of the girl is not known
 china main aisa haadasa pehali baar nahin hua he
 a video went viral in September
 jisamen ek baccha jhule main funs gaya tha or neeche gir gaya tha
 He had minor injuries
 isse pehle centre or maharashtra main bhaajapa kii sahyogi dal shivasena ne kaha ki janata ne 'zyada udne waalon ko dharashaayi kar' diya he
 The editorial in the mouthpiece Saamana states that with these results, the dream of 'congress-mukt Bharat' by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah has been dusted in the BJP ruled states
 in rajyon kii janata ne hi 'bhaajapa mukt' kaa sandesh diya he
 It states that the government is meant to win only by contesting elections, no party other than BJP survives in this country and remains as a dependent of the BJP, this trend has been defeated in four states

 a petition in this regard was filed in the Supreme Court on 22 June
 yachikakarta mumbai ke artiai activist manoranjan santosh roy hai
 Roy was warned by the Mumbai High Court of accepting a complaint of trying to mislead the court with false arguments and facts
 bombai hoicourt khaarij kar chukaa he yachikehmadabad jila sahakaari bank main notebandi ke paanch dinon ke bheetar 745 karod saath lakh se bhi zyada rakam jamaa hone kii jaanch karaane vaali janhit yachika bombai hoicourt khaarij kar chukaa he
 Earlier in the petition, Roy also made the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Home Ministry as parties
 is par rigerv bank ke vakil ne in teenon ko pakshakaar banaaye jane ko sarvatha anuchit bataate hue roy kii yachika ko galat manshaa se prerit bataaya tha
 Considering these arguments, the court warned Roy that he could be fined for such acts
 philhal,supreme courtmen yachika daakhil karne vaale roy ne daleel di he ki bombai hoicourt ne unka maamla sahi se suna nahin
 Therefore, he has challenged that decision in the Supreme Court
 notebandi se pehle bhi roy ne sarkari chhapakhane main chaape gayi noton kii khep rigerv bank ravaanaa hone or rigerv bank main aae noton kaa byora artiai ke jariye maanga tha
 The information came from different sources and found huge irregularities
 46 karod 93 lakh 16 hajaar note kaa koi hisaab nahinartiai se mili jaankaree ke mutabik 2000 se 2011 ke bich sarkari chaape khaane se paanch sau ke 19 arab 45 karod 40 lakh note ravaanaa kiye gaye
 But only 18 billion 98 crore 46 lakh 84 thousand notes reached the Reserve Bank
 yani 46 karod 93 lakh 16 hajaar note kahaan gaye iskaa koi hisaab nahin mila
 The value of these lost notes was Rs 23 thousand 465 crore
 duusare strot se isi dauraan chhap kar bheje gayi noton ke mukaable rigerv bank tak pahunche note zyada the
 The number of notes sent was four billion 44 crore 13 lakhs and the Reserve Bank said that four billion 45 crore thirty lakhs reached to it, ie one crore 17 lakh notes more
 ab is rahasy kaa ab tak koi suraag nahin mila ki raste main note bade kaise
 At present, the matter has reached the Supreme Court

 'you changed the color, changed a lot of mask, till we hanged, you have given me Kasab', some such 'shayana' reaction of public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam after the death sentence awarded to Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasabco was confirmed by the Bombay High Court was
 kasaab ko ‘nautanki kaa khalanaayak’ or ‘aatank kii aandhi’ bataate hue nikam ne kaha ki kasaab ne pakade jane ke baad kabhi kisi tarah kaa pachhtaawaa nahin dikhaaya
 He even expressed remorse to the magistrate in his confessional statement that he arrived late at CST and was able to kill fewer people there
 mukademe ke dauraan abhiyojan paksh kaa netritv karne vaale nikam ne kaha, ‘kasaab ne magistrate se kaha ki vah chahta he ki bharat par hamalaa karne ke liye or bhi aatankwaadi taiyaar rahen
 He did not regret anything he did
 ’ nikam ne kaha, ‘kasaab ko uske aakaaon ne sikhaaya tha ki agar vah jivit pakadaa jaae, to apane rukh main badlaav kar le, taaki adhikari bhram main pad jaaen
 He also tried to mislead the court by telling himself to be a minor, but we had wasted all his efforts
 ’nikam ne kaha, ‘kasaab ek prashikshit commando he or al-kaayda ke tareekon par chalata he
 al-qaeda teaches its terrorists that if they are caught, they start misleading the authorities
 kasaab ne bhi kai baar yahi tarika apanaaya, jab-jab vah mukademe ke dauraan kathin paristhitiyon main fansaa, tab-tab usne yahi karne kii koshish kii
 According to Nikam, Kasab retracted his statement several times and surprised everyone, demanding that he be tried in the US for himself in the High Court
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki kasaab ne kabhi bhi pakistan jane kii ichha nahin jataai, haalanki vah bharat ke baahar kahin mukadmaa chalaae jane kii maang karata tha
 He said that Lashkar had given him the training to confuse the authorities by making such demands
 pakistan kii ek adaalat main ek yachika daayar hui he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki kasaab ko mukademe ke liye vahaan bheja jaae
 Describing this petition as' absurd ', Nikam said,' How can this happen when Kasab is being tried in India
 jab tak uski sajaa yahaan puri nahin ho jaati, tab tak use pakistan bhejne kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 He said, '26 / 11 was a challenge for me
 na keval kasaab ko doshi tehraane ke maamle main, balki lashkar ke chehre se nakaab utaarne ke maamle main bhi, jisane mumbai main aatank failaane ke liye pakistan ke suraksha pratishthan kaa istemaal kiya

 The Mulayam group has certainly suffered a setback from the commission
 tippaniyan The commission has decided to give the party's election symbol 'cycle' to the Akhilesh-led Samajwadi Party
 amar ujaal ne isi khabar ko surkhi banaate hue likhaa he, "sapa or cycle akhile kii"
 The newspaper has given place to Akhilesh's tweet, which reads, "cycle will go on, go ahead" vahiin dilli se hi prakashit ek anya samachar patr dainik bhaskar ne mulaayam singh kii haar ke kaaran ko lead lagaaya he
 The newspaper writes, "akhilesh brought 4716 affidavits in 2 days, Mulayam did not give a single in 8 days"
 ek tarah se dekha jaae to mulaayam singh yah ladaai dhilaai baratane ke kaaran haare he
 However, Navbharat has prominently placed Navjot Singh Sidhu on the front page, aside from the SP and bicycle controversy
 akhbaar ne siddhu ke congress jwine karne par unke hi bayaan "main paidaaishi congressi hum, yah meri ghar vaapasi he" ko lead banaaya he
 Dainik Jagran, on the other hand, has created a front page lead titled 'jeet Akhilesh in father to cycle race'

 The newspaper has given the heading: 'cycle Akhilesh
 
 ' ayog ne party ke chunaav chihn 'cycle' akhilesh ke netritv vaali samaajawaadee party ko dene kaa faisla sunaaya he
 Amar Ujal has made the headlines by writing, "SP and Bicycle Akhile Ki"
 akhbaar ne akhilesh ke twit ko jagah di he, jisamen likhaa he, "cycle chalati jaaegi, aage badhati jaaegi" At the same time, another newspaper Dainik Bhaskar published from Delhi has taken the lead in the cause of Mulayam Singh's defeat
 akhbaar likhata he, "akhilesh 2 din main laae 4716 affidavit, mulaayam ne 8 din main ek bhi nahin diya"
 In a way, Mulayam Singh has lost this battle due to laxity
 haalanki, navabharat ne sapa or cycle vivaad se alag navjot singh siddhu ko pramukhataa ke saath pehle pej par jagah di he
 The newspaper made Sidhu the lead on his statement "I am a born Congressman, this is my homecoming" when he joined Congress

 ' Krrish 3 in Hrithik Roshan's superhit films has turned five years old
 ye film 31 oktober 2013 ko relies hui thi
 The film gained considerable popularity
 is maukey par ruthik roshan ne ek video share kiya
 This is a making video, in which he describes the making of an action scene
 is film main ruthik ek superhiro ke rup main dikhaai he
 Later in the film, Hrithik's fitted mask became quite popular
 View this post on instagramdo you ever feel terrified when you think about the distance between where you want to be and where you are ? Krrish in many ways for me is the struggle, aspiration and endeavor of wanting to travel the length of that distance
 When my dad thought of the idea of krrish, the first thing i felt was doubt, uncertainty and incapable, i was simply afraid, and the second thing i felt was absolute terror at the thought of not doing it because i was afraid
 So we went ahead and took the fear along with us for the ride
 What we lacked in budget, technology, specialization and resources, we made up in tenacity, teamwork, discipline and perseverance
 
 Today, we are at the heels of yet another endeavor to shorten that distance with Krrish4; and i feel exactly the same fear as i felt all those years ago
 
 And that is why i am reassured that we are on the right track

 takneekee shabdon main kaha jaae to sena ne pichley chaar saal main china seemaa par apni nai bataliyanon ko las karne ke liye apane waar vestage rigerv (dablyoodablyuar) main se istemaal kar daalaa he
 By the way, this practice is not new in itself
 paaramparik rup se nai bataliunen isi tareeke se khadi kii jaati rahi hai
 The problem is that the army did not get a chance to make up for it and its budget allocation is almost flat and it has hardly been able to bridge inflation
 takneekee rup se 88,000 javaanon kii bhartee hathiyaaron, gola-barood yaa dhaanche main bagaiyr kisi samaanupatik badhotaree ke ho rahi he
 After repeatedly pleading with the previous government for the necessary funds for the new battalions, the headquarters of the desperate army has tried to draw attention to the new needs by preparing a new roadmap
 uski shikaayat badi sidhi-si he
 5,000 crores for the purpose of creating a new core by the UPA government
 kaa aavanton to kar diya lekin yah sari raashi sena ke maujuuda bajet main se hi samyojit kar di gai
 The army headquarters has now made a one-time special allocation (rs 5,000 crore) to make up for it
 kaa) karne kaa anurodh kiya he, jis par narendra modi ke netritv vaali sarkaar vichaar kar rahi he
 For modernization, the Army has also made a list of seven areas on priority basis
 in praathamiktaaon main nai topon kii kharid (pichley lagbhag teen dashakon se ek bhi nai top nahin kharidi gai he), uddyan kor ke liye halke helicopter shaamil karnaa, tinkon or bakhtarband gadipoon main nite vijan upkaran lagaakar unhen apgrade karnaa or sainikon ke liye nai asolt riflein khareednaa shaamil he
 a top lieutenant general associated with the Army's modernization process says, "we have put forward our view of the special allocation and it seems that it will be accepted
" ’’varisht raksha vishleshak brigadier (ritred) gurmeet kanwal kaa kahana he ki yuddh ke liye rakhe sanchit kosh kaa kam ho janaa hamaari raksha taiyaariyon par pratikul asar daalega
 In his words, "the ideal situation is that there should be new procurement of weapons to raise new battalions, but not because of this, the reserve kept for the war situation has been reduced
" jaahir he, isse bal kii jangi kshamta par pratikul asar padegaa
 Although at a time when all major forces, including China and the US are reducing the size of their military force, there is little debate over the expansion of the world's second largest army, but the Army Headquarters believes that the new Mountain Strike Corps Security is absolutely necessary for the eastern border
 raksha maamalon par sansadeey sthaayee samiti ke sadasyon ke saath pichley saal sitambar main hue ek satr main thal sena ke vaais chif leftinent general philip kampoj ne sena ke str main sudhaar kii jarurat ko kaaphi mukhar rup se saamne rakhaa tha
 In Campose's words, "the likelihood that our assessment of the threat after 15 years was based on how China was aggressively resolving its disputes with neighbors, especially Its aquatic disputes in the South China Sea
 ham yah sunishchit karne kii koshish kar rahe the ki kahin agar china ne kisi samay maahaul garam karke aakraamak hone kii koshish kii to ham us khatre se nibatane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar hai
 However, in the same session, the Vice Chief admitted that the Army had used some of its reserves to try to meet the quick deadline
 sansadhano par is atirikt ‘‘boj’’ se sena ke vittiya niyojan par karaara jhatka laga he, khaas taur par yah dekhte hue ki uskaa rajasav-puunji bajet anupaat pehle hi kaaphi asantulit he
 Out of its annual allocation of resources this year, the Army got barely 22 per cent for capital expenditure - to buy new weapons and equipment for its jawans
 sarkaar apana kharch kam karne ke liye is kadar jujh rahi thi ki is saal ke liye 20,900 karod ru
 4,500 crore further cut down the allocation of Rs
 (20 fisadi se thodaa zyada) kar diya gaya
 More than 78 percent of the money going to the revenue item is spent in the salary and allowances of officers and soldiers
 jaahir he ki aise main agar aavanton paryaapt na ho to sari katautee keval gola-barood ke mad main se hi karne kii gunjaaish bachi rah jaati he
 In a paper for the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, Amit Kaushish, former financial advisor to the Ministry of Defense, wrote, "more than 60 per cent of the army's revenue allocation is spent on salaries and allowances
 bachi hui raashi anya bajet madon, jaise ki kapadon, rashan tathaa eendhan ke kharch kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye aparyaapt rahata he
 Consequently, the burden of inadequate allocation is put on those areas where there is no immediate crisis due to lack of resources - arms procurement is one of them
 ’’ek asantulit bajet kaa aashay hota he ki sena ke paas nai praudyogiki main nivesh karne ke liye bahut kam bachataa he
 To improve the same, the Army has suggested that the government spend the country's spending on defense to the current lowest level of GDP
 7 fisadi se badhaane par vichaar kare
 In a presentation to Indian mps, the Army had said to gradually increase the expenditure on defense to 3 per cent
 isse na keval aadhunikeekaran main rah gai mukhya khaamiyon ko pata ja sakegaa balki yah baaki anya deshon dwaara kiye ja rahe kharch ke bhi baraabar hi hoga
 Kanwal states that at least 2 to fight the battle on two fronts
 5 fisadi kaa aavanton to jaruri he
 The examination of the government in terms of meeting the needs of the army will also be done soon, when it will allocate the defense expenditure for the next financial year
 baharhaal, sena ko is baat kii ummid he ki is saal ke bajet main sudhaar kii disha main pahalakadami to najar aa hi jaaegi

 (from input agencies) maharashtra main rishwatkhoron ke bure din aa gaye hai
 The state's anti-corruption Bureau (ACB) has taken a record-breaking action this year, arresting a total of 1,661 bribes, more than double the previous year
 pichley saal yah aankada sirf 764 tha
 The ACB has not only caught the bribes red-handed, but has also recovered Rs 133 crore from their homes

 There was a time when people could not even know the face of bribes, even by name, but today all the information with photos can be found by clicking on the website and Facebook page

 yahi vajah he ki is saal rishwatakhori ke 1,230 maamle darj hue, jinke tahat 1,661 ghoosekhor pakade ja chuke hai or unke paas se 133 karod rupee se adhik kii nakadi bhi baraamad kii gai he

 However, the real challenge of ACB is to carry out investigations against former state ministers like Ajit Pawar, Sunil Tatkare and Chhagan Bhujbal, which is certainly not easy

 It is said that when the lamp is extinguished, it flashes loudly
 iesas kii haalat in dinon kuch aisi he
 The ISIS fighters, who have been surrounded badly in their own homes, are being killed
 uske kabje vaali 40 fisadi jameen chhin chuki he or bagdadi ke sir par maut naach rahi he
 In such a situation, this terrorist organization has once again done the same old trick to save its crumbling forts and make the world realize its presence
 chaal, begunaahon ke katl ke khaufnak video se duniya ko daraane kii
 ISIS is now badly engulfed in its own stronghold
 duniya ke 50 se zyada mulkon kii ore se rache gaye chakravyuuh main funskar ab vahi jallaad bemaut maare jane lage hai, jo kal tak begunaahon ko maut baantate gum rahe the
 But Baghdadi and his henchmen have once again demonstrated their poisonous teeth as soon as their countdown begins
 daant dehshat ke
 And Propaganda videos made with tooth panic
 bagdadi ko bhi sataane laga he maut kaa darakahin badi si kataar liye koi aatankwaadi kisi nihathe kaa sir dhad se alag kar rahaa he, to kahin kisi begunaah ko ghutanon ke bal lita kar uske sir main kareeb se goli maari ja rahi he
 Elsewhere, the entire train laden with bombs is blown up with hostages
 kuch aisi hi tasveeron ke samete apane is propeganda video ke jariye in aatankwaadiyon ne jaiseduniya ko nae sire se chunautidi he
 But according to experts, this video challenge is less, rather more irritation arising out of defeat
 kyonki hakeekat yahi he ki chautarafa hamale se ghire iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kii taadaad ab apane shuruaati dinon se bhi kam rah gai he or virdohi fujen uske kabjewali 40 fisadi jameen se use peeche dhakel chuki he yani dobaaraa un ilaakon par kabja hasil kar chuki he
 In such a situation, the talk of the goons and the recruits, even Baghdadi, the boss of terror, has started harassing himself with the risk of being caught or killed
 berahami se logon kaa katl kar rahe hai aatankivaise to iesas ke is nae video ko shoot kiye kii koi taarikh saamne nahin ai he
 But experts claim that these photos are from the Anbar province of Iraq, where the ISIS rule still exists
 or isi anbar provins main iraqi phogiyon, sarkari mulajimon or jasusi ke shaq main begunaahon ko maut ke ghat utaarne kii tasviren filmai gai hai
 In one photo, an ISIS executioner is seen beheading a man wearing orange jumpsuits with a large dagger in his hand, while in two separate photographs, terrorists are seen shooting people from behind in the head
 
 or in tasveeron iesas kaa hi ek doosraa aatankwaadi apane sanghathan kaa jhanda liye khadaa najar aa rahaa he
 While there is a charge of espionage on a person with orange jumpsuit, one of the two people being shot in the head is an Iraqi official
 ye he iesas ke haar kii nishanein tasveeron main sabase dardanaak wo tasviir he, jisamen sade libaas main ek faujee jameen par leta-leta aatankwaadiyon se apni jaan baksh dene kii bheekh maang rahaa he
 Actually, in this video, terrorists are seen following him behind the gun, while soldiers are forced to crawl like children on the ground
 or isi haal main rengte-rengte voatankwaadiyon se duhaaide rahaa he
 But this thing has been clear long ago, there is no word of mercy in the dictionary of these teachers
 or isi liye is faujee kii bhi aakhirkaar jaan le lee jaati he
 But experts claim that this is a sign of ISIS defeat
 ISIS kii ulti ginati shuruaiess ke khilaaf jari jang main mitra deshon kii aguwai kar rahe america ne kaha he ki kurdish fiteron or iraqi phujon ne iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko tikrit or ramaadi jaise shaharon main kaaphi peeche dhakel diya he
 And in these areas his waist is completely broken
 khaas baat ye he ki aath saal chale khadi yuddh ke baad america ne 2011 main america se apni fouj hataa lee thi, lekin ab usne phir se aatankwaadiyon ke safaaye ke liye nae sire se 3870 phogiyon ke maidan main utaara he or daawa kiya he ki ab iesas ke din ginati ke rah gaye hai
 Also, a temple of Lord Ganesha and Bhairav maharaj is also being built, whose work is almost half completed

 22 july kii dopaher 2
 The launch of Chandrayaan-2 at 43 minutes will be stopped just before the launching on 15 July
 Helium leakage in the Chandrayaan-2 cryogenic stage was done right after the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched its second moon mission Chandrayaan-2 on 15 July
 56 from launch on
 24 minute pehle roak di thi
 2 in the early hours of Chandrayaan-2
 51 baje desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya janaa tha
 But 56
 24 minute pehle countdown isliye roak diya gaya tha kyonki jieselvi-emke3 rocket ke cryogenic stage ke cmand gas bottle main pressure licage tha
 It was filled with helium
 yah cryogenic ingine main bhare liquid oxigen or liquid hydrogen ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam karata he
 The mission had to be stopped due to helium leakage
 bottle main helium kaa pressure level nahin ban rahaa tha
 It was reduced from 330 points to 300, then to 280 and finally to 160
 isliye launch ko rokna padaa
 Aaj Tak had already told on July 17 that ISRO will launch Chandrayaan-2 on July 22
 aa gai Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching kii date, is din ISRO bhejega rocketlehandration-2 launch, which was called off due to a technical snag on July 15, 2019, is now rescheduled at 2:43 pm IST on Monday, July 22, 2019
 # Chandrayaan2 # gslvmkiii # ISRO— ISRO (@isro) July 18, 2019 What have ISI done since July 15 Scientists first extracted propellant (fuel) from all stages of the Bahubali GSLV-MK3 rocket
 isro vaigyanikon kii yojana thi ki puure jieselvi-emke 3 ko alag-alag kiya jayega, lekin aisa karne kii jarurat nahin padi
 It has been corrected by removing only the part which was missing
 isro vaigyanikon ne helium gas bottle ko badal diya he
 Also fixed the valve from which the pressure was leaking
 acha hi hua jo ISRO ne taal di lonching
 
 
 Otherwise Chandrayaan-2 could be lost in space
 What will ISRO scientists do from today onwards? From now on, isro's analysis committee will examine the results of all tests after fixing helium gas bottle
 saath hi jieselvi-emke 3 rocket ke un hisson kii clining hogi, jisamen se eendhan nikaala gaya tha
 After this, all the parts of the rocket will be taken to the assembly unit and the assembly will be done again
 phir ise lonchpad-2 par le jaaya jayega
 The rocket will then be refueled a few hours before launch
 yah sambhaavna bhi he ki isro vaigyanik lonching ke baad prithvi ke chaaron taraf chandrayan-2 ke 5 chakkar ko ghataakar 4 kar den
 Although it will cost a bit more fuel
 prithvi kii kaksha main kami karne se aage kii yatra ke liye samay bachegaa
 Now that the distance of the moon has increased slightly, it may also happen that even after reaching the moon, scientists can also reduce the number of trips around the moon
 chaar din main nahin ho pai lonching, to 3 maheene ke liye tal jayega Chandrayaan-222 july kii dopaher 2
 The launch of Chandrayaan-2 will take place at 43 o'clock today, on July 17, it was told by reliable sources of ISRO that ISRO scientists have fixed the problem of helium leakage
 kuch test baaki hai jo 18 july tak puure ho jaaenge
 2 on 22 July
 52 baje lonching hogi
 Today i
e
 on July 18, ISRO tweeted that on July 22 at 2 pm
 43 baje chandrayan-2 kii lonching kii jaaegi
 Chandrayaan-2 is being launched after seven days, so now Chandrayaan-2 will reach the moon by 13 September
 agar 22 july ko launch nahin ho pai to sitambar-oktober main hogi lonchindgar vaigyanikon ke puraa prayaas karne ke baad bhi 22 july ko launch nahin kar pate to agle kuch hafte chandrayan kii lonching sambhav nahin he
 Because, this launch window will end
 aglaa launch windo sitambar yaa oktober main aayega
 The launch window is the appropriate time when the moon's distance from Earth is short and the probability of hitting satellites and space wastes around the Earth is extremely low
 sitambar-oktober main kyon kii jaaegi moon mishan kii lonchinglaunch windo kaa faisla isro ke trivendrum sthit spes physics lab karegaa
 The next launch window will be available in September or October
 kyonki is dauraan prithvi se chand kii duuri ausat 3
 It is 61 lakh km
 agar 15 july ko chandrayan-2 kii lonching safal rahati to use kareeb 3
 Had to travel 84 lakh km
 yani kareeb 23 hajaar kimi zyada duuri tay kerani padati
 The Supreme Court will hear on August 16 in the NRC case
