 The Union Home Ministry rejected the bill raising the salary of Delhi mlas and sent it back to the Delhi government
 ab is puure maamle par raajnneeti shuru ho gai he
 BJP MP Ramesh Vidhuri has said that the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs is in the public interest, because increasing the salary of mlas would have been a waste of public money
 saath hi selary badhaane ke liye na to sarkaar ne sahi tarika apanaaya or na hi janata ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhaa
 Vidhuri said that where the salary is increased three times, but Kejriwal is looting the government treasury of Delhi with both hands to benefit his mlas and workers, but the BJP does not tolerate this and also the central government is not tolerating any such Will also not approve the bill
 ramesh vidhudi ne kaha ki selary badhaane kii baat kejariwal kii besharmi kii nishaani he, ye kejariwal hi the jo chunaav ke pehle kehete the ki wo ek rupaya bhi selary nahin lenge, na gaadi lenge or na hi bangala, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad sarkari khazaane kii barbaadi main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 Vidhuri alleged that ever since the government was formed, Kejriwal has been doing something in which his workers benefited financially
 bhale hi wo vidhayakon kii selary kaa mudda ho, yaa sansadeey sachivon kii niyukti yaa phir aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ko moti tankhwaah par niyukt karne kaa, har jagah manshaa sarkari khazaane ko luutane kii rahi he
 Ramesh Vidhuri said that the central government does not obstruct the functioning of the Kejriwal government
 agar kejariwal niyam or samvidhan ke mutabik kaam karen, bill banaaen to use manjuuri dene main centre sarkaar ko koi aapatti nahin he, lekin kejariwal kaa makasad kaam karnaa nahin balki takaraav karke hangaamaa machaane kaa rahaa he
 He said that what has come to light after the rat was found in the mid-day meal in the Delhi government school also proves that the government is fully immersed in nepotism, because this contractor is also close to the AAP MLA Is kinship

 maratha andolan kii aag ab tej ho rahi he, maharashtra ke alag-alag hisson main lakhon kii taadaad main marathi maanush sadak par hai

 When stone was fired, glass walls cracked in the Shiv Sena office in Mumbai

 shivasena iske khilaaf nahin hai
 However, no party is leading this Maratha movement

 The first of the marathons in Maharashtra came out at Aurangabad in Murthamrathwada
 yaheen se isaki shuruyaat hui or ab is andolan kii aag puure rajya main fail rahi he
 But the question is what is the motive of this movement? The first big demand of Maratha agitators is to hang the accused of the Kordardi rape and murder
 duusari maang he ki atrositi kanoon radd kiya jaae or teesri maang he ki maratha samaaj ko shiksha or naukariyon main aarakshan diya jaae
 If the movement is not a threat to the Fadnavis government, the question now is what effect the Maratha movement will have on the politics of Maharashtra
 kya ye andolan fadanvis sarkaar ke liye khatre kii ghanti he, is andolan kii vajah se maratha or daliton main sangharsh to nahin khadaa ho jayega
 This question is now a topic of discussion in political circles, because all the party's Maratha leaders are directly or indirectly involved with Adolan

 We ourselves want that this matter should be investigated under the supervision of the High Court
 nitishabhole ki jo vipaksh is mudde par pradarshan kar rahaa he wo vahaan par hi hans rahaa he
 So what sensitivity is this? press conference ke dauraan kai baar patrakaron ne nitish se poocha ki agar bihar police thik kaam kar rahi thi, to sibiai ko jaanch kyon saunpi gai
 On this, Nitish said that this is no longer an issue, now the investigation has been given to the CBI
 jab unki chhavi par sawaal daaga gaya to nitish ne ulta patrakaron se hi puch liya
 Nitish asked what affected your image, you too are Bihari
 gaur ho ki puri press conference ke dauraan sushasan babu kaa bihari andaaj dikhaa
 In the Bihari dialect, Nitish was replying to journalists smiling with aplomb
 kabhi sawaal taal rahe the, to kuch ko aage hi badha rahe the
 On the one hand, Nitish told the opposition to show sensitivity on this issue but himself appeared in a mild mood in the press conference

 The body of a twenty-four-year-old Indian girl in a suitcase was recovered from a canal in Sydney last week
 sthaneey police ke jari bayaan main bataaya gaya, ‘‘11 march kii subah ko nirmaan kaary main lage mazdooron ne midobank park ke paas ke nahar se suutakes main rakhe mahila ke shav ko dekhne ke baad isaki jaankaree police ko di
 The deceased has been identified as Indian student Tosha Thakkar
 police postmortem report kaa intjaar kar rahi he, taaki maut ke kaarnon kaa pataa chal sake
 Police have arrested 19-year-old Daniel Stani Reginald in this murder case and police are questioning the accused in connection with the murder and sexual assault case
 unhone is baat kii pushti kar di ki peedit chaatra ko aakhri baar nau march ko jinda dekha gaya tha
 Tosha Thakkar was studying accountancy at Sydney College of Business and IT and was a permanent resident of Australia
 thakkar ke doston or parivaar waalon ne media ko bataaya ki unhen is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin he ki use kyon maaraa gaya
 Significantly, Thakkar's body was kept in a suitcase and the workers noticed it while repairing the oil pipeline from the canal near Midobank Park and reported it to the police
 sidney marning herald samachar patr ke anusaar aaropee codrone sthit thakkar ke ghar ke sameep hi rahata tha or saptahanth ko police ne use giraftaar kar video link ke jariye paramata kii sthaneey adaalat main kal pesh kiya

 rajdhani dilli main auto rickshaw chalaane vaale suresh bihar ko vishesh darja dilaane ke liye dilli ke ramlila maidan main 17 march ko hui adhikaar raily kaa hissaa nahin ban sake
 Moving from Mahatma Gandhi's memorial site Rajghat, he suddenly asks, "are you coming from the rally?" What did Nitish ji say? Sir, what will Nitish also do, Bihar does not have power
 yah kaam to centre kaa he
 Bihar must get special status, only then factory will be there
 ’’ adhed umr kaa yah auto chaalak bihar ke motihaari ke rahane vaale hai, lekin is shaks kii bhaavana or raily main umadi bheed yah dikhaati he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaise badi kushalta se apni majaburi ko janata kii jubaan par chadhaane main safal ho rahe hai
 The demand for special status has been made by Nitish such a magical box, in which on one hand he has tried to stop the anger that is developing by not meeting the expectations of the people, on the other hand, the golden imagination of Bihar's better future
 Also shown
 lekin unka asli lakshya kya he, iskaa izhaar ramlila maidan main unki hunkaar bhari apil se saaf ho gaya, ‘‘agar ve vishesh darje kii hamaari maang par faisla lene main deree karte hai, to hamen laduya hoga
 We will have to make such preparations for 2014 that if not now then we have to give it
 ’’narendra modi ke netritv par bijepi main chal rahe ghamaasan or congress kii girti saakh tisare morche kii sambhaavna ko bhi bal detii he, aise main nitish ek aise mudde ke saath dilli ke daravaaje par dastak de rahe hai jisamen dost ke dushman or dushman ke dost ban jane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He did not directly appeal to the people at Adhikar Rally to win more seats in the election, but pointed out, "in 2014 we have to look neither left nor right
 sirf yah dekhnaa he ki dilli main aisi sarkaar baithe jo hamaare dard ko samajhe
 "that is, Nitish sought the support of winning as many seats in the Lok Sabha elections on one hand and on the other, expressed his intention of becoming kingmaker in power at the Center
" haalanki unhone dilli main adhikaar raily ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh, yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia or vitt mantri pi
 In this regard, Chidambaram demanded that the Economic Survey and the General Budget should be implemented soon
 in mail-mulakaaton ke baad nitish behad aashwast najar aae or kaha, ‘‘jo kuch pradhanmantri ne kaha he usase spasht sanket mila he ki baat aage badhegi, jo kuch kaha gaya he, us par kaam bhi hoga
 His gestures also point towards the politics of Bihar and the Center, as soon after the announcement of dmk's withdrawal of support, Nitish said that there is no threat to the central government and the Lok Sabha elections will be held on time
 
 lekin samay seemaa ke bare main puche jane par nitish ne yah kahkar vikalp khulaa chhod diya, ‘‘is sarkaar kaa kaarykaal ab kitna bachaa he? unhen is par jald kaam karnaa hoga, tabhi iskaa ‘phayda’ milegaa
 However, after creating a stir in the politics of Delhi, Nitish, who reached Patna, left another Shigufa and created panic in the camp of his ally BJP
 endie ke bhavishya ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par nitish ne apane khaas andaaj main media ko jawaab diya, ‘‘is bare main na main jaanata hum or na hi aap
 Nobody can say anything about the future
 ’’ ek virdohi dal kii vishaal raily main shaayad yah pehla mauka tha jab manch se centre sarkaar se jude bhrashtachar, mahangaai jaise muddon ko chuaa tak nahin gaya
 But the BJP is also getting aggressive on JDU preparations and the 17-year-old alliance seems to be cracking
 kabhi bijepi ke bheetar hi nitish ke khilaaf zyada mukhar nahin hone kaa aarope jhelane vaale bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi bhi chetavanee ke lahaze main baat karte hue narendra modi se apane 35 saal puraane rishte kii duhai de rahe hai
 On the implication of Adhikar rally, Sushil Modi also roared, "congress is a sinking ship and anyone who tries to ride on it will also sink with it
 ’’ saansad shatrughna sinha or bijepi cote se nitish sarkaar main mantri ashvini choube ne bhi elaan kar diya ki party soobe kii sabhi 40 siton par ladgaye kii takat rakhti he
 But the party's problem is that JDU has robbed the credit of development so far in Bihar
 duusari taraf kendriya sansadeey kaary or yojana rajyamantri rajeev shukla ne adhikaar raily kii safalataa ke fouran baad kaha, ‘‘centre bihar kii behatari ke liye harsambhav prayaas kar rahaa he
 The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are not only aware of the demands of the Chief Minister of Bihar, but are also considering them
 ’’ bijepi se bad rahi duuri ko congress bhi apane andaaj main hawa detii dikh rahi he
 On 6 March, the Prime Minister himself described Bihar as the fastest growing state, and Nitish immediately issued a statement expressing gratitude
 uske baad 9 march ko bihar ke rajyapal devanand kunwar kaa tripura transfar kar centre sarkaar ne nitish ko tusht karne kii koshish kii, jinase bihar sarkaar ke sambandh sahaj nahin the
 Now the central government can soon form a committee to consider the definition of backward states and the criteria for granting special state status, which Nitish will definitely make his 'trump card' in the 2014 election
 nitish ne raily main lagaataar pradhanmantri manmohan singh or vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram made his political intent even more clear by reading the ballads in the pride
 unhone kaha, ‘‘centre ke ek shabd (maapdand badalane par vichaar) se hi hamen khushi mili he, lekin dekhte hai ki centre us par kaayam rahata he yaa nahin
 Nitish, who specializes in throwing every dice in politics, has shown a dream of giving conditional support to the Congress in this era of coalition so that the Congress in Bihar again refrains from holding lalu-paswan
 soobe main dam tod chuki congress ko bhi lalu yadav se zyada nitish se rishta mufeed hoga
 Muslim population in the state 16
 53 fisadi he or raily main nitish ne khaas taur se aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke campus ke liye rajya main uplabdh karai gai jameen kaa zikr karte hue centre se us par jald se jald kaam karne kii bhi maang kii
 However, JDU national president Sharad Yadav refuses to join hands with the Congress under any circumstances
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘yah sawaal hi nahin uthta
 There will be no political decisions with special status
 vishesh rajya kaa darja hamaara ek ahm mudda he, chunaav kii baat alag he
 (see conversation)
 nitish kii ranneeti se bihar ke purv mukhyamantri or argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav bhi waakif hai
 He says, "nitish's graph has gone down and now he wants the Congress not to tie-up with me (from Lalu) and on the other hand, he is also bargaining with the BJP to make Narendra Modi before the elections
 Do not project
 ’’ unka aarope he ki endie raaj main nitish ne hi tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bihar ko vishesh darja dene se roka
 Not only this, Nitish did not take any step towards getting help even after being the chairman of the committee for special package to the state
 lalu kaa aarope he ki nitish ko tab dar tha ki bihar ko package yaa vishesh darja mil gaya to argedy ko phayda mil jayega (dekhen baatcheet)
 Seeing Nitish's changed attitude, Congress Kurmi leader and Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma is trying to woo him, though he has not achieved much success so far
 argedy pramukh lalu yadav kaa maananaa he ki yah rajnatik maang he or ve endie se alag nahin honge
 JDU President Sharad Yadav himself says that political decisions with special status will not change
 baharhaal, apane is pantare se nitish ne apni rajnatik takat kaa ehsaas karaayaa he
 It is a smart move to save our political future in the guise of Bihar's interest after the next general election, in the wake of speculation of a non-congress and non-bjp government at the Center

 The government said on Tuesday that it is in favor of bringing all the facts before the country in the 2G spectrum allocation case, hence it has supported the formation of a joint parliamentary committee, while the opposition alleged that if the government had already been active in this matter, the country Revenue loss to the exchequer of the state could have been prevented
 rajyasabha main varsh 1998 se 2009 tak duuranchaar licenson or spectrum ke aavanton sahit vibhinn muddon par 30 sadasyeey sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa gathan karne kaa prastaav pesh karte hue doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal ne kaha ki is mudde par desh bhar main vyaapt aam raay ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne jepisi gathit karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Lok Sabha has already passed a resolution to this effect
 30 main se 20 sadsy nimna sadan se honge
 It is worth mentioning that the government has given Prof
 of Congress from Rajya Sabha in JPC
 pi je courian, abhishek manu singhvi or praveen rashtrapal, dramuk ke tiruchi shiva, rakanpa ke vaai pi trivedi, bhaajapa ke es es ahaluwalia evam ravishankar prasad, jadyu ke ramchandra prasad singh, basapa ke satish chandra mishra tathaa makapa ke seetaram yechuri ko sadsy banaae jane kaa prastaav kiya he
 Sibal said that the government wanted the issue to be discussed in Parliament but was not given a chance to speak in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki aam taur par kaig kii report sansad main pesh hone ke baad loklekha samiti ke paas jaati he or uske baad piesi kii report ke saath us par sansad main charchaa hoti he
 But in this case, the Opposition is demanding a discussion in Parliament directly
 doorsanchaar mantri ne kaha ki unke sarkari khajaane ko koi nuksaan nahin hone ke bayaan ko bevajaah tool diya gaya or use sahi sandarbh main pesh nahin kiya gaya
 Sibal claimed that he never said that if the spectrum was bid, the government would not have received revenue
 unhone kaha ki yadi maujuuda sarkaar kii doorsanchaar nitiyon main koi khami hoti to doorsanchaar ghanatv march 2005 ke 8
 It would not have risen to 66 percent by December 2010 as compared to 95 percent

 He said that some people have turned the telecom sector's success into a scam
 jetali ne kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch ke liye jepisi gathit kiya janaa isliye jaruri tha taaki puri vyavastha main ai khaamiyon kaa pataa laga kar unako durust kiya ja sake
 He said that questions were also raised about the administration, corporate, media, ministers, politicians in this case
 isliye puri vyavastha kii saakh ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye yah kadam jaruri tha
 The BJP leader said that the government was misrepresenting things after the government gave a note of some deals during the previous NDA regime
 unhone kaha ki tatkaaleen mantri ne urisa, purvottar, purvi uttar pradesh jaise kuch doorsanchaar cirkilon main do baar nividaayen aamantrit kii thim lekin kisi bhi bolidaata ke saamne nahin aane par ‘pehle aao pehle paao’ kaa rasta apanaaya gaya
 Participating in the discussion, Rashid Alvi of the Congress said that the government is serious about bringing the truth to the fore and the government's stand is still that no one will be spared
 unhone bhaajapa par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki bhrashtachar kii charchaa karte hue karnataka ke maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 He said that telephone rates became cheaper due to the policies of the government, it should also be noted
 basapa ke brajesh pathak ne kaha ki jepisi ke gathan kaa prastaan kaaphi jaddojahad ke baad aayaa he or unhen ummid he ki yah kisi na kisi nishkarsh par pahuchengi
 Tapan Kumar Sen of CPI (M) termed the proposal as "late come better" and said that if the government had agreed earlier, a session of Parliament would not have been wasted

 Now GST is going to affect your salary? The Economic Times has claimed that due to this effect, companies across the country are preparing for major changes in their employees' salary packages because now the employee's salary breakup will be heavy on the companies
 shopping or restaurant bill ke baad ye or bada jhatka hoga
 If the breakup of salary such as house rent, mobile and telephone bills, health insurance, medical bills, transportation will come under the purview of GST, then companies will have to redefine your salary package
 taxjankaron ne companiyon ko salaah dena shuru kar diya he ki vah apane echaar department ko karmchaaree ke selary brallep ko nae sire se samajhane ke liye kahe
 Significantly, after a recent decision of the Authority of Advance Ruling (AAR), companies have become aware of employee salary and are working on a new salary breakup to save their tax liability
 gauratlab he ki eear ne ek khaas maamle main faisla diya he ki companiyon dwaara canteen chargees ke naam par karmchaaree kii selary se katautee jiesti ke daayre main hogi
 After this decision, experts believe that many of the facilities given by the companies to the employees whose salary is deducted will be reduced to GST
 philhal companiyaan karmchaaree ko cost tu company ke aadhaar par selary package taiyaar karti thi or kai sevaaon ke aivaj main katautee ko selary kaa hissaa banaakar diya jaataa he
 But now if it is taken under the purview of GST, then companies will change the breakup of an employee keeping the cost to the company as the basis, so that the tax liability of the company is not affected
 tex jaankaron ke mutabik karmchaariyon kii selary main kai aise brallep shaamil rahete hai jinke aivaj main companiyaan seva pradaan karti he or karmchaariyon ko in sevaaon ke aivaj main pement bina kisi raseed ke mil jaataa tha
 This makes it difficult for the tax department to estimate GST on these services and companies prepare a salary breakup of employees to save their tax at their convenience
 lihaaja, company dwaara karmchaaree ko di ja rahi sevaayen yadi jiesti ke daayre main aati hai to companiyon kii koshish desh jiesti ko bhi karmchaaree ke cost tu company main jod de jisase uski tex dendaree par asar na pade

 vah bike par savaar hokar divya nahin ek bhari puri ghunghraale baalo, shokh aawaaj or bolti si ankhon vaale shaahakaar kaa peechha kar rahaa tha

 So far 150 children have died of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in Bihar
 nishchit rup se is mudde par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii sabase adhik aalochana ho rahi he
 Then there was Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi who, as the leader of the opposition, demanded resignation after the most aggressive of any incident
 in sabake baad rajya ke swasthya mantri mangal pandeya jo apane samvedanheenata ke kaaran mazaaq ke paatr ban baithe hai unki aalochana ho rahi he
 These three leaders are upset with the media because the media chases them and some of them cite their earlier statements and ask when will they resign
 media khaaskar electronic media main kai din tak subah se shaam tak prime time main bacchon kii maut, aspataalon kii badahaal sthiti ke bahaane sarkaar kii nishchit rup se jaij binduon par channel ke patrkaar se sampadak tak ek swar se aalochana karte hai
 But the ruling Janata Dal United of Bihar says that the media has under the cover of criticism either journalists to raise their personality in the name of the disease or the agenda of the channel is only to tarnish the image of Nitish Kumar and in this effort Janata Dal United According to the chief spokesperson of Sanjay Singh, now some channels have come down on the abuses of language and all the criteria of journalism
 sanjay singh ke anusaar jis tarah kuch channel ke patrakaron ne ICU ko apana news studio banaaya or kuch sampadakon ne news studio se angrezi ho hindi jaisi bhashaa or shabdon kaa prayog kiya wo unke bacchon ke prati samvedansheeltaa nahin balki ek agenda ke tahat bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke chehre ko karaab karne kii ek raajnneetik saazish kii bu aa rahi thi
 Shivanand says that the channels which are most aggressive against Nitish Kumar, the history of the last few years should be picked up and see if they have used such language and words against the BJP government
 gorakhpur main bhi bacchon kii maut hui tab unka kya line thi yah bhi palat kar dekhie
 But Sanjay Singh certainly does not have an answer as to why his leaders are cutting off the media on this issue
 lekin unki safaai he ki wo halaat par nazar rakhe yaa media ke saath tu-tu main-main shaamil hon
 At the same time, the silence of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, whose own leader, Tejashwi Yadav, has been the cause of his party's trouble in this entire episode
 uske varisht netaa shivanand tiwari kaa kahana hai ki ham log bhi is baat se hatprabh hai ki jis bhaajapa ke saath milakar nitish sarkaar chalaa rahe hai usee bhaajapa ke anguli par naachne vaale channel or sampadak jis prakaar mujaffarpur prakaran par khaaskar nitish kumaar ke prati aakraamak hai wo ek tarah se unhen chetavanee di ja rahi hai ki aap apane seemaa main rahiennyathaa aap chhavi kii jo puunji he use karaab karne main kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 However Shivanand Tiwari says that Nitish himself is such a mature leader who knows the difference in criticism and agenda and who is directed by whom
 vahimbihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne mujffarpur main peedit bacchon evam vahaan parijanon ke bayaan par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki media ke saath jo nitish kumaar ke dwaara durvyavhaar hua vah ashobhaneey he
 He said that media should also follow its limits and decorum
 maanjhi ne kaha ki mujffarpur main zyaadaatar garib abhi vanchit varg or antim paaydaan par rahane vaale logon kii mautein hui hai
 Expressing regret over the death, he said that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar should have gone in time
 apni kamiyon ko chupaane ke liye nitish kumaar media ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 In recent times, which has been in Bihar
 nishchit taur par soobe ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke sushasan kii tasviir bayaan karata he
 Power and governance have become completely hollow
 lekin janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana hai ki akhir agar hospital main media kaam kar rahaa hai yaa kuch kamiyaan dikhaa rahaa he
 Because the government has given this freedom to the media, otherwise, whether it is Delhi or Mumbai in any other state with media of this country and Bihar, Lucknow or Bhopal, leave the ICU in any government or private hospital, can you do such reporting even with the general ward? Huh
 unka kahana he ki nishchit rup se bahut kuch kiya ja saktaa tha kuch abhaav rahaa hoga jiske kaaran maut hui jiskaa sabko dukh he lekin iske liye koi aalochana ke naam par gaali kii bhashaa apane prime time main dikhaae to yah kahaan ki patrakarita he
 At the same time, media experts believe that Nitish Kumar and his government are critical of this whole issue
 kai aise qadam hai jaise mujaffarpur sthit aspataal der se yaa to swasthya mantri mangal pandeya yaa mukhya mantri nitish kumaar kaa janaa, vahaan unhone apni aalochana ek tarah se nimantrit kii
 Apart from this, the absence of sufficient number of doctors was also an issue where many children could have been saved if they had decided in the beginning
 yah sab mudde aise hai jahaan aalochana jaays he
 But at the same time, Health Minister Mangal Pandey is absent from the whole scene or his announcement of the Central Government like in 2014 for Muzaffarpur Hospital or setting up of other AIIMS in Bihar
 in sab muddon ko agenda se gaayab karnaa nishchit rup se kisi ko pach nahin rahaa he

 The film crossed the 200 crore mark in 12 days

 Book: Surayaz Gift (paperback) Writer: Malvika Natraj Publisher: Puffin (penguin) Pages: 61 Price: Rs 199: Writer and blogger Malvika Natraj claims that she has been writing stories since the age of 12
 ab unhone bacchon ke liye ek kitaab likhi he- 'suraayaaj gift'
 The book's cover says that children over eight years of age can read it
 par isaki kahani is kadar baandhe rakhti he ki aath kya, assi kii umr main bhi aapako ye acchhee lagegi
 'surayaz Gift' boasts many stories within itself
 9 saal kii suraayaa ko antee lila ek aisi notebook tohfe main detii hai jisamen jo kahani likho, wo sach ho jaati he
 Aunty says that good stories will have good effect and bad will have bad effects
 suraayaa apni samaj or kalpana se acchhee-buree kahaniyaan notebook main likhti jaati he or uske aas-paas ve kahaniyaan ek-ek kar sach hoti jaatin hai
 Then one day Suraya's story catcher disappears and she realizes the truth behind this spell
 'har kahani amar he'lekhika ne ek bacchee ke urvar dimag ko uski likhi kahaniyon ke zariye dikhaaya he
 Small stories have been filled inside the main story which easily fit into the plot of the book
 kahani shuru hoti he suraayaa ke sapane se or uske sapane par hi khatam hoti he
 The story floats between dreams, real life and fiction in such a way that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish the three
 kahani kaa ye paksh bilkul bachche ke dimag sareekha lagata he- kalpanaaon se bharaa hua
 Stories, like dreams, are beyond the limits of time
 jab ek din ek ladke ke liye suraayaa ne karaab kahani likhi, us ladke ke saath khub bura hua
 Suraya was then gilted and stopped writing stories
 ek bachche ke liye kahaniyon par yakeen karnaa jitna aasaan he, utana hi us yakeen kaa tut janaa, is baat ko dikhaaya he nataraj ne
 Through the story catcher, she also tells that every story, written, thought out in the world is special
 har kahani kahin darj hoti he or amar hoti he
 If we believe our stories then they can change the real world as well
 kyon padhenvaise ye kitaab aapke bacchon ke liye likhi gai he
 But if you are interested in listening or writing stories, then you must also read
 kitaab aapako 'syrius' or 'popular' se dur ek maasoom duniya main le jaaegi
 Beautiful illustrations of the book have been made by Two Neon Studios
 bacchon ke nazariye se dekhen to ye unhen likhane or padhane ko prerit karegi
 Will tickle his fancy mind

 In fact, it was the bjp's opportunity to create its own class of Indian Shalakapurus because of the Congress's over-allotment to the nehru-gandhi family over many freedom fighters and prominent Indians from other walks of life
 or chunki nehru-gandhi parivaar kii viraasat ko mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa tha, lihaaja unke rajnatik mahimamandan ko kamjor karne kaa sabase acha tarika nae sire se anya logon kii chhavi ko pesh karne kaa tha
 In fact, Modi gave broad indications to this effect the day after he took over as Prime Minister, when he did not go to Nehru's tomb on his death anniversary on 27 May
 pratham pradhanmantri ko yaad karne ke liye unhone sirf ek twitor sandesh de diya tha

 in hastiyon ko congress netaaon kii bajaae swatantraaa senaniyon ke rup main pesh kiya janaa gandhi or patel ke maamalon main sabase spasht he
 If a Statue of Unity will be created to honor Patel as part of the bjp's ambition to cut off his identity as a Congress leader, the government will have another on Mahatma Gandhi on Gandhi's death anniversary on 30 January Will issue postage stamps which will focus on Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 philhal mumkin he, yahi sab jari rahe

 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav established his supremacy in the party in this fight and also tried to break the anti-women image of the party
 akhilesh yadav yah baat acchhee tarah se jaanate the ki unke paanch saal ke kaarykaal main rajya kii kanoon-vyavastha, party kaaryakartaaon kii gundgardee or mahilaon kii suraksha bade mudde hai
 By putting issues like law and order and hooliganism of activists on Uncle Shivpal, Akhilesh tried to make his image immaculate, but he realized that the Kimhila security issue can only be overcome with the help of a female leader
 iske baad akhilesh yadav kii patni or saansadadimple yadavane isaki zimmedaari uthaai or akhilesh yadav ke kandhe se kandhaa milakar chunaav prachaar shuru kar diya

 iske saath hi vah apni sarkaar kii taraf se mahilaon kii suraksha kii guarantee detii hai
 a compulsion of Akhilesh Yadav to bring Dimple forward is also considered that his younger brother's wife Aparna Yadav is contesting from Lucknow Cantt this time and she has been giving her opinion on every issue with impunity as it came
 After that, Akhilesh was afraid that the command of the women brigade in the party would not go to Aparna Yadav
 itnaa zarur he ki dimple yadav ne jis tarah congress ke saath gathbandhan main badi bhoomika nibhaai or is chunaav main prachaar kiya he, usase ek baat saafe ho gai he ki ab samaajawaadee party ke sabhi faislon main dimple yadav kii bhagidaari badhati jaaegi
 However, it will be clear only after the election how effective Dimple proved to be on the issue of women's safety

 america kii charchit food chen mcdonalds or company ke bharat main emdi vikram bakshi ke bich kaa vivaad sulajhane hi vaala tha ki ek nai mushkil saamne aa gai he
 In fact, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has banned the settlement between mcdonald's India and Vikram Bakshi in a decade-long dispute
 NCLAT ne awaas evam shahari vikaas nigam (hudco) kii yachika par yah aadesh diya he
 Hudco has claimed Rs 195 crore dues on Vikram Bakshi
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 27 may ko hogi
 The case is being heard by a two-member bench headed by NCLAT chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay
 yah he maamladansal, fast food chen mcdonalds ne bakshi ke saath beete dinon adaalat ke baahar conot plaza restaurant li
 (CPRL) to buy
 yah restaurant chen uttar or purvi bharat main america kii fast food company ke outlets kaa parichaalan karti he
 Meanwhile, Hudco filed a petition in the NCLAT
 hudco kaa kahana he ki mcdonalds ke saath sauda puraa hone se pehle uskaa bakaayaa milanaa chahie
 Hudco in its petition referred to the case going on in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) of Delhi
 beete buudhvaar ko sunwaayee ke dauraan hudco kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe solicytor general tushaar mehta ne apiliy nyaayaadhikaran se kaha ki abhi is maamle kaa niptaan nahin ho saktaa
 This matter is pending in the DRT
 mehta ne kaha ki bakshi dwaara conot plaza restaurant li
 Its dues should be settled before the sale of its stake in
 tushaar mehta kaa kahana he ki diarti ne bakshi par seepiarel main apane share bechney yaa use sthanantarit karne par roak lagaai he
 However, Bakshi and mcdonald's counsel appealed to the Appellate Tribunal to move that their agreement is nearing completion
 unhone peeth se ek duusare ke khilaaf daayar apni apni yachika ko waapas lene kaa bhi aagrah kiya
 To this, the bench said that we cannot stop the order of the tribunal
 NCLAT kii peeth ne aadesh diya he ki is maamle kaa hudco ke saath niptaya ja rahaa he
 Dispute of mcdonald's and Vikram Bakshi In 1995, the US junk food maker mcdonald's and Vikram Bakshi entered into an agreement
 yah samjhauta bharat main america kii is fast food company ke store yani bikri centre kholane ke bare main kiya gaya
 The agreement was for a period of 25 years
 iske baad donon ne milakar kanat plaza restarent limited (seepiarel) naam se ek jointer venture banaaya
 Both had equal share in it
 is joint venture company ko mcdonald ke naam se desh ke uttari or purvi kshetra main bikri kendra kholane kaa jimmaa diya gaya
 In 2017, mcdonald's canceled the agreement with CPRL for not receiving royalties
 lambii chali kanoonee ladaai ke baad vikram bakshi kaa uttar or purvi bharat ke 165 mcdonald brands ke restaurant par kabja barkaraar rahaa jabaki dakshin or pashchimi bharat main mcdonald naam se kaarobaar chalaane kaa theka amit jatiya ke netritv vaale westlife deveopment ke paas he
 The dispute between Vikram Bakshi and mcdonald's, which began in 2013, first surfaced in 2008, when mcdonald's tried to buy Bakshi's 50 per cent stake in CPRL
 yah maamla duniya kii nigahon main tab aayaa jab 2013 main bakshi ko seepiarel ke prabandh nideshak ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Bakshi then reached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)
 ensielti ne bakshi ke paksh main faisla sunaaya or unhen phir se pad par bitha diya gaya
 Now it was mcdonald's and the company challenged the decision to place Bakshi in the NCLAT
 haalanki ab bakshi or mcdonalds samjhauta karnaa chaahate hai

 On Saturday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also going to rally in Amritsar and Ludhiana in Punjab
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko manmohan singh ne uttarakhand ke rudrapur se chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat kii
 In his rally, PM praised Kendra and counted the achievements of the Center in front of the people
 piem kii raily ko dekhte hue punjab main suraksha ke kade intjaam kiye gaye hai
 The autobiography of Shyouraj Singh Bechain is titled 'my childhood on my shoulders
 ' yah aatmakatha bataati he ki ek dalit bachapan kaisaa hota he
 Childhood has passed, but the fate of his Dalit identity is still forced to carry on his shoulders Shyouraj Singh restless
 ve dilli vishvavidhyalay ke hindi vibhaag main padhaate hai
 On the thirteenth of the last month in the seniority order, he was to be made the head of the department
 bataaya jaataa he ki baarah tarikh ko vishvavidhyalay ne unase dastauez liye, unke naam par lagbhag muhar laga di
 But then something happened that the whole process was stopped
 pichley qareeb ek maheene se ab hindi vibhaag main koi vibhaagadhyaksh nahin he
 It is being told that another professor put his claim in the seniority order
 bataaya yah bhi ja rahaa he ki us praadhyaapak kii daavedaari do baar vishvavidhyalay khaarij kar chukaa he
 But pressure from some influential leaders and journalists is such that the university is afraid to form a final opinion on the name of Shyouraj Singh restless
 shyoraj singh baichaiyn agar hindi vibhaag ke adhyaksh nahin banenge to unka kya bigadega? ve pichley teen dashakon se lagaataar likh rahe hai
 Has been published in all the prestigious newspapers and magazines
 arase tak unhone akhabaaron main kollam likhe hai
 The number of his books is very large
 unako mili sammaanon kii sankhya bhi bahut zyada he
 His autobiography has been translated into English and has been published by Oxford
 un par kai shodh ho chuke hai
 In this sense, the post of Head of the Department of Delhi University does not add anything to his fame
 lekin dilli vishvavidhyalay ke liye yah kisi badnuma daag se kam nahin ki vah ek dalit ko pehali baar vibhaagadhyaksh banane ke aitihaasik avasar ko taalane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 In the Hindi department of Delhi University, established in 1922, no Dalit has yet got the chance to be the head of the department
 shyoraj singh baichaiyn udaar lekhak hai
 They have been watching the Dalit movements with sympathy, but have not been part of it very aggressively
 sambhav he, kuch log is baat ke liye unki aalochana bhi karte rahe hon
 But they are basically mainstream writers who should not be intimidated
 is puure vivaad ke bich ve bilkul chupchaap rahe hai
 Yet it is his ideological location and caste identity due to which Delhi University, despite his seniority, considers him inconvenient for himself
 yah daleel bahut sahuuliyat bhari he ki agar kisi praadhyaapak ne unki varishthata ko chunauti di he to isamen vishvavidhyalay kya kar saktaa he or jati kahaan se aati he? darasal yah chunauti bhi yaad dilaati he ki asli daavedaaron ko nakli daavon se visthapit karne kaa khel purana he or isamen tark se zyaada taaqat kii chalati rahi he
 Obviously, it would not have been easy to challenge their seniority so easily if there were no restless Dalits
 lekin shaayad ab dalit pahchaan ko chunauti dena bhi itnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 People are coming together to bring justice to Shyouraj Singh restless
 somvaar ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main ek sankethik march bhi nikaala gaya
 Apparently, the late Shyouraj Singh restless has to be given his authority
 lekin dilli vishvavidhyalay sammaan ke saath yah kaam kar sake to uski garima bhi badhegi, dalit asmita kaa bharosa bhi badhegaa
 Megastar Amitabh Bachchan revealed how he once went missing at a crowded railway station due to his attachment to the train

 ’unhone bataaya, ‘yatri dwaara bataae gaye sthaan par pahunchane par mere mata-pita ne bataaya ki main pul kii farsh par baitha behad khush tha
 Even at that age my legs were quite long and i could see the trains swinging on the railings passing through there
