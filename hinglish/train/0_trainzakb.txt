 non-kashmiri students themselves have not been able to say anything about the confrontation with the local students before this year
 tirangaa lahraane ko lekar takaraav hua

 chatraayen kah rahi hai ki hamaara mudda suraksha he, hamaare mudde kaa sampradayikaran mat kiijie
 Why nits or media journalists who are covering their faces within the campus will be responded to by being called secularists is being grossly lewd
 soshal media ke girohon ko kya ye sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie ki centre sarkaar ke santhaan ke campus main siarpief or police kii suraksha ke bich ladke ladakiyon ko cheharaa kyon chhipaana pad rahaa he
 In this picture girls are standing with folded hands
 nivedan tip aisa pradarshan maine nahin dekha tha, aam taur par chaatro ke pradarshan main mutthiyaan hi laharaai jaati hai
 Students are calling on the Minister of Human Resources and pleading for justice from the Prime Minister
 vahiin chinar ground main puure din chaatr jamaa rahe
 They say that they will stay here at night too
 nita sharma ne chaatr chaatraon ke mata-pita se baat kii he
 They are very concerned about the safety of their children and they are also of the opinion that in the current situation the NIT should be shifted or their children transferred to another NIT
 is bare main centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi aashwaasan yaa bayaan nahin aayaa he
 You might have seen a video on Wednesday in which a gathering of students is taking place with the team of local police officers, Ministry of Human Resources
 is video ko dekhakar laga ki chaatro kii sari maange maan lee gayi hongi or jammu-kashmir police ke adhikariyon ke kilaaf karrwai bhi ho gai hogi
 Actually, this is exactly the opposite
 jisaki jaankaree aage duungaa
 In this video you will see that the students are standing on the stage and telling what their demands are
 jammu kashmir police ke adhikariyon ko hataaya jaae, enaiti ko rajya se baahar shift kiya jaae
 Teachers should be removed
 kaash aisa mauka hyderabad or jeenyu ke chaatro ko bhi miltaa lekin aisa mauka apatiai ke chaatro ko mila tha
 The Union Minister of Information spoke to him
 bhale unki maang na maani gai ho
 The students are quite excited in the video but are now apprehensive whether their fight will reach any destination or not
 jammu kashmir police ke kisi adhikari ke kilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui he
 On the contrary, the police has filed an FIR against two students on charges of sabotage
 khabaron ke mutabik NIT prashasan 31 chaatro ke kilaaf karrwai karne kii soch rahaa he
 non-kashmiri students, who are students of all religions of other states, Hindu Muslims are Sikh Christians, some of them say that they are stuck because of communalization of the issue
 do video aae hai
 a video by the students and then of the police showing the students vandalizing
 ye tasviren chaatro ke taraf se di gayi hai jinamein police ek chaatr ko gher kar berahami se maar rahi he
 a student has been hit by five six policemen
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar laga ki police ne chaatro ke saath krurta barti he, jo ki dikh bhi rahaa he
 The students say that the girl students have also been beaten and the students facing physical challenges were also beaten
 chaatraon kaa kahana he ki unhen fail karne se lekar balaatkaar tak kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 After a while the police released a video on their behalf
 police ke is video main chaatr ek car par pathar barasaa rahe hai
 Are ransacked
 police par pathar maar rahe hai
 Now it is not clear whether the students first stoned or the students vandalized after police sticks
 yah sab jaanch kaa vishay he
 The media is presenting it as the reason why the sticks on the patriots, many people are raising the question of patriotism to make some unknown secularists thunder
 lekin aap apni ankhon se dekhiye or dimag se sochiye ki lathi kiske aadesh se chali, takaraav kyon hua
 There are two types of videos and many types of rumors
 faisla kar lijie
 According to the media, these are patriots, so why is the NIT talking about taking action against them
 police ne exiaar kyon kii he
 The India Today website has written that the rss-backed Jammu Kashmir Study Circle says that it is not that all Kashmiri students are against students from outside
 na hi sabhi kashmiri cricket main bharat ke haarane par khush hote hai
 The NIT incident suggests that separatist elements have made inroads into educational institutions
 inhen baahar karnaa hoga
 Had the influence of separatist elements increased there, such an incident would not have happened before
 khud gaiyr kashmiri chaatr is saal ke pehle tak sthaneey chaatro se takaraav kii koi baat nahin bataa paa rahe hai
 There was a clash about the tricolor
 lekin jinhone pakistan kaa jhanda laharaaya kya unke khilaaf exiaar hui he
 You will ask this question or get angry on two or four journalists
 koi jaanch cameti bithai gai
 Like JNU, rumors have been spread all over the country and people have started believing again
 chaatro kii ladaai college prashasan se he
 They do not want any police action against Kashmiri students
 unhen bharosa nahin he to apane college ke prashasan par
 The comments is tarah ke maahaul ke asar main rajasthan ke chittorgarh kii mewar uniwarsity se 16 kashmiri chaatro ko 25 april tak ke liye nilambit kar diya gaya
 The college had a clash after the India West Indies match
 uske pehle yahaan ke 4 kashmiri ladakon ko bif khaane ke aarope main pakadaa gaya tha, peeta bhi gaya
 The police later said that the Veterinary Board in its report said that the meat eaten was not beef
 abhi forencik jaanch kaa intazaar he
 Whatever facts you keep on NIT Srinagar, you will reach the same which is being spread through whatsapp in various types of messages
 lekin ham phir bhi baat karenge
 At the same time, students stayed in the Chinar Ground all day
 unka kahana he ki ve raat ko bhi yaheen date rahenge
 Neeta Sharma has spoken to the parents of the students
 ve apane bacchon kii suraksha ko lekar kaaphi chintit hai or ve bhi is raay ke hai ki maujuuda halaat main NIT ko shift kiya jaae yaa unke bacchon kaa duusare NIT main tabadalaa kiya jaae
 There is no assurance or statement from the Central Government about this
 aapane buudhvaar ko ek video dekha hoga jisamen sthaneey police adhikariyon, maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii team ke saath chaatro kii ek sabha ho rahi he
 Seeing this video, it seemed that all the demands of the students would have been accepted and action would have been taken against the officers of Jammu and Kashmir Police
 darasal iskaa thik ulta hua he
 i will give you further information is video main aap dekhenge ki chaatr manch par khadey hokar bataa rahe hai ki unki maange kya hai
 J&K Police officers should be removed, nits should be shifted out of the state
 shikshakon ko hataaya jaae
 i wish students of Hyderabad and JNU would get such an opportunity but FTII students got such an opportunity
 kendriya soochna mantri ne unase baat to kii thi
 Even if their demand is not accepted
 video main chaatr kaaphi utsahit hai magar ab ashankit hai ki unki ladaai kisi manzil par pahonchegi bhi yaa nahin
 No action has been taken against any officer of Jammu and Kashmir Police
 ulta police ne todphod ke aarope main do chaatro ke kilaaf exiaar kar di he
 According to reports, the NIT administration is thinking of taking action against 31 students
 gair kashmiri chaatr jisamen duusare rajya ke sabhi dharmon ke chaatr hai, hindu muslim sikh isai sab hai unamem se kuch kaa kahana he ki ve is masale ke sampradayikaran ke kaaran funs gaye hai

 "pranaam sar'',meri mataji bihar main anganwari sevika hai
 He has not received honorarium for the last 12 months
 maandey kii raashi maatr 3,000 rupee centre sarkaar kii ore se tathaa maatr 750 rupee bihar sarkaar kii ore se he (kul 3,750 rupee)
 Similarly, in 2016, eight months honorarium was not given
 maa kii kamai ke ve 3,000 rupee unke liye badi baat hai, aaajeevan kaam kar apana guzaaraa chalaane kii abhyast rahi hai
 According to government statistics, there are about 81,000 Anganwadi centers in Bihar, and there are 1 servant and 1 assistant in them
 kya sevikaon kaa 3,750 or sahayikaon kaa kareeb 2,000 hi itani badi raqam he, jise har maheene na dene se sarkari khazaana bhar jayega or usase vigyaapan hoga?sarkaar itnaa kam maandey dena tay karne ke baad in majaboor mahilaon se begaari kyon karvaa rahi he? kya isliye, kyonki ye mahilaayein vahaan ho rahe bhrashtachar par kabhi awaz nahin uthaa sakengi? uske baad yah daawa kar sako ki meri sarkaar main 1 rupaya chalata he to puraa 1 rupaya pahunch jaataa he? chunaav aane se pehle dhaporshankh kii tarah maandey badha kar 4,500 bhi kar diya gaya he, jabaki ise 1 lakh kiya janaa chahie tha
 "A letter from the daughter of an Anganwadi servant from Bihar has arrived
 main soch rahaa tha ki is patr ko aapke saamne kaise rakhun
 If a woman is able to protect her existence with such a small amount of money, then how much will this money matter
 state kii samiksha kii zarurat aa padi he
 Our state systems are rotten
 unke bheetar sambhaavnaaon kaa vistaar nahin ho rahaa he
 'prime Time' has twice elaborated on Asha Worker
 maaloom nahin, saamaanya darshakon kii janata ke apane hisse se ho rahi ninsaafi ko lekar kitna dard hota hoga
 Nevertheless, we have shown that no one can see, see your own pain on the screen
 zamana hamdard nahin he, to kya hua
 Now read another letter
 main kyon kahata hum ki bharat kaa media arjeet loktantr ko barbaad karne par tula hua he
 This paper deals with ASHA workers
 "raveesh sar''
 Asha of Bihar has been performing for about a month
 ek maheene se tikaakaran or swasthya vibhaag kii puri vyavastha buree tarah chaupat he
 The local media there are not showing this news at all
 local patrkaar akhbaaron main khabar chhapane ke liye 500 rupee maangate hai
 There were 40,000 Asha performances in Patna for two days, but the Chief Minister or any of his representatives did not report them
 jila prashasan ne pradarshan karne vaali aashaaon par FIR karne kaa aadesh diya he
 i have made some reports on this, but our news is not having any effect
 aap pleez Prime Time main ek baar inke pradarshan kaa zikr kar den, badi meharbaani hogi
 "asha workers in Bihar have been on strike since 1 December
 patna main ab dharna-pradarshan gardanibaag ilaake main hota he
 On December 12 and 13, Asha workers from across the state had gathered
 ab vahaan se hatakar rajya bhar ke sadar aspataalon or praathmik swasthya kendron main unka pradarshan chal rahaa he
 On December 27, Asha Worker jammed the train across the state
 neshnal news channelon kaa ab koi kuch nahin kar saktaa he
 Only the propaganda of Hindu Muslims and government will run there
 janata kaa mudda nahin chalegaa
 Common journalists do not have the ability to understand the game of issues happening through channels, what to expect from the public
 khud ham logon ko inkaa game samajhane main kai saal lag gaye
 Are we going to see the day that the public is pleading with the media to show us, give us the impression, you are my mother and father
 ishwar kare, yah din na aae
 However, the work of Asha workers is extremely important
 hamen bataaya gaya he ki aspataalon main doctor use 'tu-tadaak' kar baaten karte hai
 Is embarrassing
 garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal tak le jane kaa kaam bhi aashaa varkar karti hai
 Get 600 of a delivery
 nasbandi karaane ke 150
 But they never get more than Rs 1,500
 vah bhi samay se nahin miltaa he
 Think how someone would walk in such a small amount of money
 bihar main kai baar badhaane ke naam par aashaa suparwizaron kii raashi badha di jaati he, jinke neeche kai aashaa varkar hoti hai
 They also get less
 4,000-5,000 se adhik nahin miltaa he
 Asha workers in different states get different salaries
 inaki maang he ki sarkari karmchaaree ghoshit kiya jaae or selary 18,000 kii jaae
 The Prime Minister announced an incentive of Rs 2,000 in October, which many did not get
 inaki ek maang yah bhi he ki protsaahan raashi kii nautanki band kii jaae
 Instead, salary should be given
 aap in tasveeron main dekh sakate hai ki aashaa varkar ekajute hokar pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is no media here
 kahin khabar chhapi bhi hogi, to kisi kinare main
 Media is called the watchdog of democracy, but you can see that democracy is beating without media
 balki media vahaan he hi nahin, jahaan lok apane tantra se sawaal puch rahe hote hai

 film abhinayta rithik roshan or abhinetri kangana ranot ke bich chal rahaa vivaad ek ahm padaav par pahunch gaya he
 Hrithik has handed over all the documents related to this dispute to the cyber cell of Mumbai Police
 isi bich rithik kii kanoonee team ne daawa kiya ki unke paas thos saboot he ki rithik kaa kangana ke saath koi sambandh nahin tha
 Hrithik's lawyer said in a statement that do not get confused in Jubani war
 ham sabit karenge ki rithik roshan kaa kangana ranot ke saath koi sambandh nahin tha
 We have produced concrete evidence before the investigating authorities
 unhone kaha ki is sambandh main jarurat padane par or bhi sakshya pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 Let us tell you that the dispute between Hrithik and Kangna has deepened
 abhinetri ne unki tasveeron or email ko media ko dene or jaanboojhkar unki garima ko chot pahunchane ke liye rithik kii giraftaar kii maang ko lekar police ayukta se sampark kiya tha
 On this, Hrithik's lawyers made sensational allegations on Kangana
 kanganake vakil rigwan siddiqui ne chah april ko police ayukta dattatreya padasaalgikar ko ek patr bheja tha
 It urged to look into the matter and take appropriate action
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kangana ke behad nijee email or photograph rithik ne unke saath dosti ke dauraan hasil kiye the
 He has alleged that it is being mischievously used by Hrithik Roshan with criminal intent to harm his client's image
 ritikne siarpisi kii dhara 149 or 150 ke tahat sangyeya aparaadh kiya he
 He should be arrested under Section 151 of crpc
 uttar pradesh main chaudaa varsh se chale aa rahe raajnneetik vanvaas ko khatm karne ke liye bijepi pichley ek-do saal se puraa damaum laga rahi he
 On the other hand, angry with the party, Varun Gandhi, one of the star campaigners of the BJP, is moving around the place to increase his penetration among the youth across the country
 sutron kii maane to varun uttar pradesh main chunaav prachaar main party ke liye prachaar bhi nahin karenge
 According to sources, he is interacting with youth across the country on issues like Idea for New India and Nation Building
 varun gandhihyderabad, jammu, churu, jaipur or pune main yuvaaon ke saath interection kar chuke he
 If sources are to be believed, during the UP elections, in many other cities too, they will interact with the youth
 isse pehle varun gandhi ne indore main aise hi kaarykram ke dauraan rohit vemula kii aatmahatya, kisaanon kii aatmahatya jaise muddon par bayaan diya tha
 Varun Gandhi will continue this program in many other cities of the country in the next few weeks in a similar manner
 sutron kii maane to 25 farvari ko jodhpur, 7 march ko punjab, 9 march ko vijaywada, 10 march ko jaipur, 15 march ko faridabad, 18 march ko jabalpur, 20 march ko bhubaneshwar, 23 march ko uttarakhand or 29 march main dilli yuvaaon ke saath interection karenge
 BJP has made Varun Gandhi a star campaigner for the third, fourth and fifth phases in the UP elections
 vahiin sutron ke anusaar party ne haalanki varun gandhi kaa ek bhi kaarykramchunaav prachaar main nahin lagayaahai, jis vajah se vah party se naaraaz bhi hai
 There is another reason for his resentment
 vah he sultanpur loksabhaa kshetra main ummidavaaron ke naam par unke saath kisi bhi tarah kii charchaa nahin kii gai
 Let me tell you that in the meeting of bjp's national executive in Allahabad last year, posters were put up to present Varun as CM candidate
 ise lekar pradesh ke netaaon ne apni naaraazgi piem modi or party adhyaksh amit shah tak pahunchaa di thi
 According to sources, the BJP high command is angry with Varun Gandhi since then

 Priyanka said at the Nukkad Sabha organized at Fursatganj intersection that Smriti is telling lies to the public that Rahul does not come to Amethi
 yahaan ke logon ko sari sachai pataa he
 The public also knows whose heart is Amethi and whose heart is not
 chunaav main bahut se bahari log aa gayi hai
 He said 'smriti Irani distributed shoes to people, to say that the people of Amethi do not even have shoes to wear
 vah soch rahi hai ki aisa karke vah rahul ji kaa apmaan kar rahi hai
 The truth is that she is insulting Amethi
 amethi or raibareli kii janata ne kabhi kisi se bheekh nahin maangi'
 Priyanka Gandhi said, 'you teach them that the people of Amethi and Rae Bareli respect themselves, do not beg in front of anyone
 bheekh maangana he to wo log khud aapse voton kii bheekh maangen'
 It may be known that Smriti had recently said in a public meeting in Gauriganj area of amethi that when the head of the Baraulia village went to Delhi to meet him, he did not have proper slippers in his feet
 ‘tab maine uski vyavastha karaayi thi or gaanv ke vikaas ke liye 16 karod rupee dilwaaye the'

 Globalization has greatly increased the aspirations of the country's consumers

 Therefore, opposition to the RSS in the matter of opening up the economy further has slowed down

 sarkaar haai speed train, upnagareey train coridor, trek or bandargahon tathaa khadaanon se judi rail linon, i-commers or nirmaan kshetra main epadi ko manjuuri dene kii yojana bana rahi he
 Advocates of indigenous economics now agree with the need for FDI in areas like infrastructure and defense, unlike the previous NDA government

 But to what extent FDI should be approved in various sectors, there are some apprehensions

 Free-market advocates like Lord Meghnad Desai do not consider the idea of swadeshi as useful in modern-day India, but rather have a sense of remorse towards it
 ve kehete hai, ''swadeshi samay kii barbaadi ke alaava kuch nahin he
 The idea of economics is that you leave the worry of producing things and focus on making them better

 Gurumurthy believes that unabated imports have been one of the main reasons for the country's current account to reach a deficit position

 Increasing the deficit in the current account may increase inflation and cause the devaluation of the country's currency

 The current account recorded a turnover of $ 89 billion in 2012-13 during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, a record in any one fiscal year
 upie sarkaar ne isaki vajah sone or tel aayaat main teji bataai
 But Gurumurthy argues that this was due to heavy import of capital goods, which increased from an average of $ 10 billion per year under the NDA rule to $ 65 billion in nine years of UPA rule (2004 / 05 to 2012 / 13)
 
 bakaul gurumurti, puunjigat vastuon ke atyadhik aayaat se utpaadan kshetra lagbhag thapp ho gaya

 Meanwhile, capital goods imports increased in this period

 Such data shows that imports of manufactured goods were largely imported and domestic production fell

 neuyork main bhartiyadiplomat devayani khobragade ke saath jo hua vah achambhit kar dene vaala tha lekin uske baad vahaan sejo sarkari bayaan aa rahe hai, ve to or bhi stabdh karne vaale hai
 It states that Devayani Koki is not an immunity of any kind and she was treated with the same kind of common man in such cases
 yani unke saath bhi aparaadhiyon jaisaa hi bartaav kiya gaya
 They were handcuffed, stripped of clothes, searched and placed in barracks with addicts
 yah sab ek aise aarope main jiskibaare main abhi koi jaanch bhi nahin hui he
 But the most disappointing thing is that the US authorities refused to give Devotani the diplomatic immunity that she deserved
 itnaa hi nahin devayani ne na keval dilli kiek adaalat main hi nahin balki hai court main is maamle par pehle hi naukaraani ke khilaaf yachika derkhi he
 This is not the first time that American officials have done this to any Indian personality
 bharat ke purv raksha mantri jorge furnandis ke bhi kapade utaare gaye the or purv raashtrapati doctor kalam kejute tak utarava liye gaye the
 Many other well-known people have been abused there
 lekin ab pani sir se utar gaya he
 The Government of India has taken the right step this time and has begun to give care
 uske rajanyikon se idi card maangana or congress ke pratinidhiyon se namilnaa ek sahi kadam he
 In fact, American officials believe that their coin runs in the world and they will do whatever they want
 lekin ab is maansikta main unhen badlavkarna hi hoga
 And the steps that India has taken this time are necessary
 ho saktaa he devayani ne koigalat kaam kiya ho lekin phir bhi unke saath barbartapurna vyavhaar kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 Now it would be appropriate to take the matter to its logical end

 raja ne us kanya kaa naam savitri rakhaa
 Like the moon of Rajakanya Shukla Paksha, it started increasing day by day
 dhire-dhire usne yuvavastha main pravesh kiya
 Anyone who saw his form Lavanya would be fascinated by it
 jab raja ke vishesh prayaas karne par bhi savitri ke yogya koi var nahin mila to unhone ek din savitri se kaha, 'beti! ab tum vivaah ke yogya ho gai ho isliye swayan apane yogya var kii khoj karo
 ' pita kii ajna sweekaar kar savitri yogya mantriyon ke saath swarna rath par baith kar yatra ke liye nikali
 She returned to the palace for a few days after visiting the ascetics and pilgrimages of the Brahmarsis and Rajarshis
 usne pita ke saath devarshi naarad ko baithe dekh kar un donon ke charnon main shraddha se pranaam kiya
 Maharaj Ashwapati asked Savitri the news of her visit
 savitri ne kaha, 'pita ji! tapovana main apane mata-pita ke saath nivas kar rahe dyumtsen ke putr satyawan sarvatha mere yogya hai
 Therefore, i have chosen her husband as my heart
 naarad ji sahasaa chaunk uthe or bole, 'rajan! savitri ne bahut badi bhul kar di he
 Satyavan's father has been deprived of the kingdom by enemies, he is leading an ascetic life in the forest and has become blind
 sabase badi kami yah he ki satyawan kii aayu ab keval ek varsh hi shesh he
 King Ashwapati got worried after hearing Narada ji
 unhone savitri se kaha, 'beti! ab tum phir se yatra karo or kisi duusare yogya var kaa varan karo
 Savitri was Sati
 usne dridhtaa se kaha, 'pitaaji! satyawan chaahe alpaayu hon yaa dderghaayu, ab to vahi mere pati hai
 Once i have accepted her as my husband, then how can i select another man? savitri kaa nishchay drudh jaanakar maharaj ashwapati ne uskaa vivaah satyawan se kar diya
 Gradually, the time had also come in which Satyavan's death was certain
 savitri ne uske chaar din purv se hi niraahaar vrath rakhana shuru kar diya tha
 On the order of her husband and in-laws, Savitri also went with her husband that day to take fruits and wood in the forest
 achaanak vriksh se lakdi katate samay satyawan ke sir main bhayanak dard hone laga or vah ped se neeche utarkar patni kii god main let gaya
 At that time Savitri saw a male with a fierce figure wearing a red robe
 vah saakshaat yamraj the
 He told Savitri, 'you are a lover
 tere pati kii aayu samaapt ho gai he
 i have come to get it
 tippaniyan After saying this, Yamraj removed the microbe from the body of Satyavan and with it, he went towards the south
 savitri bhi unke peeche-peeche chal di
 On hearing Savitri's wise and religious words, Yamaraj's heart melted
 savitri ne unase apane saas-sasur kii ankhen acchhee hone ke saath rajya prapti kaa var, pita ko putr prapti kaa var or swayan ke liye putr vati hone kaa aashirwad bhi praapt kar liya
 Thus Savitri snatched her husband from the face of death on the strength of Sattva
 dekhen video -sirf bura hi nahin he ravan! Accepting the father's orders, Savitri set out on a golden chariot with qualified ministers to travel
 kuch dinon tak brahmarshiyon or rajarshiyon ke tapowanon or tirthon main bhraman karne ke baad vah rajmahal main laut ai
 Seeing Devarshi Narada sitting with her father, he bowed with reverence at the feet of both of them
 maharaj ashwapati ne savitri se uski yatra kaa samachar poocha
 Savitri said, 'father! Dumatsen's son Satyavan, who lives in Tapovan with his parents, is absolutely worthy of me
 at: maine man se unheen ko apana pati chunaa he
 Narada ji suddenly got shocked and said, 'rajan! Savitri has made a big mistake
 satyawan ke pita shatruon ke dwaara rajya se vanchit kar die gaye hai, vah van main tapasvi jivan vyateet kar rahe hai or andhe ho chuke hai
 The biggest drawback is that Satyavan's age is now only one year left
 naarad ji kii baat sunakar raja ashwapati vyagr ho gaye
 He told Savitri, 'daughter! Now you travel again and select another worthy groom

 He said firmly, 'dad! Whether Satyavan is short or longevity, now he is my husband
 jab maine ek baar unhen apana pati sweekaar kar liya phir main duusare purush kaa varan kaise kar sakati hum? Knowing Savitri's determination, Maharaj Ashwapati married her to Satyavan
 dhire-dhire vah samay bhi aa pahunchaa jisamen satyawan kii mrityu nishchit thi
 Savitri started fasting for four days before that
 pati evam saas-sasur kii ajna se savitri bhi us din pati ke saath jangal main fal-phool or lakdi lene ke liye gai
 Suddenly, while cutting wood from the tree, Satyavan started having severe pain in his head and he came down from the tree and lay in his wife's lap
 us samay savitri ko laal vastra pahane bhayankar akruti vaala ek purush dikhaai padaa
 He was a real Yamraj
 unhone savitri se kaha, 'tu pativrata he
 Your husband's age has ended
 main ise lene aayaa hum
 The comments itnaa kah kar yamraj ne satyawan ke sharir se sookshm jeev ko nikaala or use lekar ve dakshin disha kii ore chal die
 Savitri also followed him
 savitri kii budhimattapurna or dharmayukt baaten sunakar yamraj kaa hriday pigal gaya
 Savitri also received the blessings of her mother-in-law and her father-in-law with good eyes, the father of the kingdom, the father the son of getting the son and the son being the daughter of her husband
 is prakaar savitri ne satitv ke bal par apane pati ko mrityu ke mukh se chin liya
 Watch the video - Ravan is not only bad! maharaj ashwapati ne savitri se uski yatra kaa samachar poocha
 Savitri said, 'father! Dumatsen's son Satyavan, who lives in Tapovan with his parents, is absolutely worthy of me
 at: maine man se unheen ko apana pati chunaa he
 Narada ji suddenly got shocked and said, 'rajan! Savitri has made a big mistake
 satyawan ke pita shatruon ke dwaara rajya se vanchit kar die gaye hai, vah van main tapasvi jivan vyateet kar rahe hai or andhe ho chuke hai
 The biggest drawback is that Satyavan's age is now only one year left
 naarad ji kii baat sunakar raja ashwapati vyagr ho gaye
 He told Savitri, 'daughter! Now you travel again and select another worthy groom
 savitri sati thi
 He said firmly, 'dad! Whether Satyavan is short or longevity, now he is my husband

 Satyavan's father has been deprived of the kingdom by enemies, he is leading an ascetic life in the forest and has become blind
 sabase badi kami yah he ki satyawan kii aayu ab keval ek varsh hi shesh he
 King Ashwapati got worried after hearing Narada ji
 unhone savitri se kaha, 'beti! ab tum phir se yatra karo or kisi duusare yogya var kaa varan karo
 Savitri was Sati
 usne dridhtaa se kaha, 'pitaaji! satyawan chaahe alpaayu hon yaa dderghaayu, ab to vahi mere pati hai
 Once i have accepted her as my husband, then how can i select another man? savitri kaa nishchay drudh jaanakar maharaj ashwapati ne uskaa vivaah satyawan se kar diya
 Gradually, the time had also come in which Satyavan's death was certain
 savitri ne uske chaar din purv se hi niraahaar vrath rakhana shuru kar diya tha
 On the order of her husband and in-laws, Savitri also went with her husband that day to take fruits and wood in the forest
 achaanak vriksh se lakdi katate samay satyawan ke sir main bhayanak dard hone laga or vah ped se neeche utarkar patni kii god main let gaya
 At that time Savitri saw a male with a fierce figure wearing a red robe
 vah saakshaat yamraj the
 He told Savitri, 'you are a lover
 tere pati kii aayu samaapt ho gai he
 i have come to get it
 tippaniyan After saying this, Yamraj removed the microbe from the body of Satyavan and with it, he went towards the south
 savitri bhi unke peeche-peeche chal di
 On hearing Savitri's wise and religious words, Yamaraj's heart melted
 savitri ne unase apane saas-sasur kii ankhen acchhee hone ke saath rajya prapti kaa var, pita ko putr prapti kaa var or swayan ke liye putr vati hone kaa aashirwad bhi praapt kar liya
 Thus Savitri snatched her husband from the face of death on the strength of Sattva

 i did not like to go to coaching, but do not know why my mother used to coach me every time
 meraa maa kahati thi, 'chaaya bitiyaa aap kii maths or english bahut kamazor he
 Why doesn't someone join coaching? Otherwise, there will be disappointment in the board
 'main kahati thi ki mujhe padhaa kar kya hoga? mummy, baad main jhaadu hi to lagaauungi

 donon hi bahut hoshiyaar the
 i was weak in studies
 maine 10veen kii board kii pariksha deen
 There were holidays after the exam
 main apni saheliyon ke saath ghoomane kaa plan bana rahi thi
 But during that time there was also fear of mind results

 As the day of the result was getting closer, my heartbeat was increasing
 28 may ko jabarijaltane vaala tha tab subah-subah neend apane aap khul gai

 darasal, kam number aane par papa sabase pehle khaanaa hi band karavaate the
 i had seen this happen to my brothers so i had experience
 khayr, jab rigelt aayaa to mere bhai ne ilahabaad se phone kiya ki jaldi se role number bolo main rigelt dekhtaa hum
 i was afraid to give the roll number that if the number comes down, then my beating is certain
 maine chupake se mummy kaa mobile switch of kar diya or kuch der baad jo hua wo alag hi tha
 My father got angry at me and said that send the roll number to brother quickly
 mujhe pataa he ki tum fail hone vaali hogi tabhi aisa kar rahi ho
 i thought that today my father is going to take all his anger out on me

 bhartiya tennis khilaadi sania mirza ne kaha he ki landan olympics ke liye tennis team ke chayan ko lekar hue vivaad ke kaaran khilaadiyon ke bich manmutav paidaa hua tathaa mahesh bhupati ke saath bhi unke rishte bigade, lekin ab vah ise bhulaakar liender pes ke saath mishrit yugal main padak jeetne par dhyaan kendrit kar rahi hai
 It is notable that Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna refused to team up with Paes in the London Olympics, and Paes was then forced to team up with lower-ranked player Vishnuvardhan
 vah samjhaute ke tahat mishrit yugal main sania ke saath jodi banaaenge
 Sania said, "nobody has benefited from this controversy
 isse hamaare bich manmutav paidaa hua or yah durbhagyapurna he
 i am glad that it is over and i can now focus on doing well in the Olympics together with Leander and winning medals
 " unhone kaha, "hamen ab ise bhulaakar padak jeetne par dhyaan lagaana chahie
 Leander reached the final of Wimbledon and it is a positive thing
 main or mahesh haar gaye or yah durbhagyapurna he
 We should have played in the finals
 " Sania said that her relationship with Bhupathi has also deteriorated due to the selection dispute
 unhone kaha, "us vivaad ko dimag se nikaalnaa aasaan nahin tha or vah mujhe pareshaan kar rahaa tha
 From what i said, such a situation was not created
 mahesh or main bahut achche mitra he, lekin vivaad se hamaari dosti main bhi daraar padi he
 "sania said that she would have preferred to pair with Bhupathi in mixed doubles, but she can win medals with Paes as well
 sania ne kaha, "main forehand khilaadi hum or mahesh bacand khilaadi hai, isliye main apni pasand bataa rahi thi, lekin maine kabhi nahin kaha ki main kisi khilaadi ke saath kheloongi yaa nahin
 i am ready to play with anyone for my country
 " unhone kaha, "liender kaaphi achche khilaadi hai or mere dost bhi hai
 i have played with him for a long time
 olympics main unke saath khelnaa mere liye sammaan kii baat he
 i am in good form, i won the French Open title with Bhupathi
 pes bhi vimbledon ke final main pahunche hai, isliye vah bhi acchhee farm main hai
 We have a good chance of winning a medal
 " Sania has won medals in Commonwealth and Asian and afro-asian Games and said that now she wants to put Olympic medal in her bag
 unhone kaha, "mere paas rashtramandal, asian khelon or effro-asian khelon samet 12 padak hai
 Only the Olympic medal remains, so this time i hope to win a medal
 "tippaniyan Asked if she would practice with Paes before the Olympics, Sania said, "I have not met Leander and i have not spoken
 vah vimbledon final main the, lekin unase mil nahin saki
 Captain SP Mishra contacted everyone and said that he wants everyone in London by 23 July, so i will reach there then
 " Sania said, "I am going to America and play in San Diego
 vahaan se main landan jaaungi or 23 july ke baad mujhe lagata he ki main liender ke saath abhyaas shuru karuungi
 "she did not agree at all with the idea that winning medals in mixed doubles would be easier than the others, as it has a 16-team draw
 sania ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki yah galat he ki mishrit yugal spardhaa aasaan hogi
 People are saying that if you win two matches, you will reach the semi-finals and you will win the medal, but the draw is quite tough
 duniya kii sarvshereshth mishrit timen drow main shaamil hai, isliye match jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 " ullekhneey he ki bhupati or rohan bopanna ne landan olympics main pes ke saath jodi banane se inkaar kar diya tha, or iske baad pes ko majaboor hokar kam ranking ke khilaadi vishnuvardhan ke saath jodi banani padi
 He will pair with Sania in mixed doubles as part of the deal
 sania ne kaha, "is vivaad se kisi kaa bhala nahin hua
 This created bad blood between us and it is unfortunate
 mujhe khushi he ki yah samaapt ho gaya he or main ab liender ke saath milakar olympics main acha pradarshan karne or padak jeetne par dhyaan kendrit kar sakati hum
 "he said," We should forget it now and concentrate on winning the medal
 liender wimbledon ke final main pahunchaa or yah sakaaratmak baat he
 Me and Mahesh lost and it is unfortunate
 hamen final main khelnaa chahie tha
 " sania ne kaha ki chayan vivaad ke kaaran unke bhupati ke saath rishte bhi kharaab hue hai
 He said, "it was not easy to get that controversy out of my mind and it was bothering me
" maine jo kuch kaha tha, usase aisi sthiti nahin bani thim
 Mahesh and i are very good friends, but our friendship has also broken due to the dispute
 " sania ne kaha ki vah mishrit yugal main bhupati ke saath jodi bananaa pasand karatin, lekin pes ke saath milakar bhi vah padak jeet sakate hai
 Sania said, "I am a forehand player and Mahesh is a backhand player, so i was saying my choice, but i never said whether i would play with a player or not
 main apane desh ke liye kisi ke saath bhi khilne ko taiyaar hum
 "he said," Leander is a very good player and my friend too
 main lambey samay tak unke saath khel chuki hum
 It is an honor for me to play with him in the Olympics

 The judge also referred to the arguments of Lakhvi's counsel regarding the delay in hearing
 aadesh main kaha gaya he, ‘pichley chah saal main abhiyojan ke 50 gavaahon kaa adaalat main pareekshan hua or 100 se zyada gavaahon kaa abhi pareekshan baaki he, jisamen or das saal lag sakate hai
 Referring to the sections of the anti-terrorism Act, the court said that it would have to take into account the time the accused has spent in jail and also the time during which, if bail is not sanctioned, he may be detained Stayed in haalanki nyaayadhish ne apane aadesh ke antim pare main kaha ki unki ye tippaniyan antarim he or uskaa mukademe kii sunwaayee yaa uske bhavishya par koi asar nahin padegaa

 isse pehle ke opershan chinhit the or unke liye sarkaar kii sahmati kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Describing the operation carried out at comfortable and identified locations, Suhag said that the surgical strike that took place last year cannot be compared to other operations conducted by the army
 kyonki un oparation ko raajnneetik sahmati nahin thi
 On the question of what separates the surgical strike from other operations, the plan of the surgical strike had started long ago, he said that such operations were not carried out earlier in which simultaneously targeting many terrorist targets in the radius of 250 km
 Be taken away

 unhone bataaya ki yah spasht tha ki agar aatanki hamalaa hota he, to is tarah kii karrwai karne ko kaha ja saktaa he
 Suhag immediately asked the Northern Army commander to prepare a plan and start training

 He said that it was clear to me that the martyrdom of soldiers is to be avenged
 sena ne iske kuch plan taiyaar kiye or baad main modi sarkaar ne isaki samiksha kii, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swayan isaki samiksha kii
 "the government was worried, the troops would come back," Suhag said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was informed about this at the Army headquarters in New Delhi
 pradhanmantri or sarkaar kii sabase badi chintaa ye thi ki 'sabhi sainikon kaa surakshit waapas aana sunishchit ho
 If there is any casualty, then his body should not be left behind
 'unhone kaha ki narendra modi kii aguwai vaali endie sarkaar ne strike kii anumati dekar ek bold faisla liya or sena par bharosa kiya

 yah bilkul aasaan nahin tha ki sainiko ko elosi ke us paar bheja jaae or unhen waapas le aayaa jaae
 'india will strike again if needed' When asked if the surgical strike managed to achieve the anticipated effect, Suhag said that India has introduced something of uncertainty to the world after the surgical strike last year
 general ne kaha ki pichley saal hui sargical strike ke baad seemaa par koi bada hamalaa nahin hua
 Suhag ended his remarks by reiterating General Bipin Rawat and said that if needed, India would again undertake a surgical strike in Pakistan

 Dengue has turned negative when they are investigated

 Prison officials had informed the court here that they were suspected to have died
 bataate chalem kiindrani,unke purv pati sanjeev khanna or unke driver shyamvar raay nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 The trio are accused of killing their 24-year-old daughter, Sheena, in April 2012 and locating her body
 abhinay se raajnneeti main aaye makkal nidhi maiyam (emenem) ke sansthaapak camel hasan (kamal haasan) ne yah kahkar nayaa vivaad khadaa kar diya he ki aaazaad bharat kaa pehla ‘ativaadee hindu' tha
 He was referring to the Nathuram godse who murdered Mahatma Gandhi
 is par bijepi (BJP) ne somvaar ko kaha ki hatyara kisi aatankwaadi se bahut alag hota he
 The BJP also accused Haasan of doing divisive politics and following the Congress and Communists in presenting a false image of Hindus for appeasing minorities
 tamilnadu ke aravakurichi main ravivaar kii raat ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue camel hasan (kamal haasan) ne kaha ki vah ek aise swabhimani bhartiya hai jo samanta vaala bharat chaahate hai jahaan tirange ke teen rang barkaraar rahen
 In the context of different religions, he mentioned the three colors of the tricolor
 unhone kaha, ‘main aisa isliye nahin bol rahaa hum kyonki yah muslim bahul ilaaka he, balki main yah baat gandhi kii pratimaa ke saamne bol rahaa hum
 Azad was the first extremist Hindu of India and his name is Nathuram Godse
 vahiin se isaki (atvaad kii) shuruyaat hui
 Haasan said that he has "self-proclaimed himself to be a great-grandson of Gandhi"
 mahatma gandhi kii 1948 main hui hatya kaa hawala dete hue hasan ne kaha ki vah us hatya kaa jawaab khojane aaye hai
 The state BJP reacted strongly to Haasan's statement
 party ne nirvachan ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataate hue adarsh aachaar samhita ke ghor ulanghan ke liye hasan ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii
 In New Delhi, Union Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that Haasan does not understand the difference between a killer and a terrorist
 sitaraman ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, 'isse sabit hota he ki vah hatyare or ek aatankwaadi ke bich ke fark ko nahin samajhate hai
 a killer is very different from a terrorist
 isliye agar vah puraa itihaas padhenge or saath hi mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke mukademe kaa adhyayan karenge to unhen antar pataa chal jayega
 He said, "he is in a hurry to prove that he is on the path of appeasing the minorities for the sake of his new political party
" 'tamilnadu ke mantri ke tii rajendra balaji (KT Rajenthra Bhalaji) ne hasan ke bayaan par vivaadit pratikriya dete hue kaha ki emenem sansthaapak ke is bayaan par unki jeebh kaat deni chahie ki swatantra bharat kaa ‘pehla ativaadee hindu tha
 'extremists have no religion
 naa hindu or naa muslim yaa isai
 Senior AIADMK leader Balaji accused the MNM of planting seeds of violence and also requested a ban on him
 unhone hasan par alpsankhyak vot jutaney ke liye naatak karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 However the Congress and the Dravidar Kazhagam supported the MNM leader
 tiensisi adhyaksh ke si alaagiri ne kaha ki vah hasan se 1000 fisadi sahamat hai, jabaki dike pramukh ke veermani ne kaha ki godse aresas se prashikshit tha
 Answering questions from journalists on the issue, Alagiri alleged that Hindu organizations like RSS believe in crushing anti-ideology
 alaagiri ne kaha, ‘main unka samarthan karata hum or naa keval 100 fisadi balki 1000 fisadi unase sahmati jataata hum
 'state BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan said that the whole country was in a position to kill Mahatma Gandhi, but no one can justify this
 unhone kaha ki is jaghanya aparaadh ke liye godse ko faansee di gai thi
 He said it was condemnable that Haasan used the term 'hindu extremism' in a Muslim-dominated area
 saundarrajan ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘haalanki, vah nai tarah kii raajnneeti karne kii baat karte hai, lekin vah vot bank kii puraani, chaalaaki bhari, jahrili or vibhaajankaree raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 He said that Haasan's statement is equivalent to inciting communal violence
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘isliye, aise vyakti ke chunaav prachaar par roak lagani chahie
 The police should take action in this regard as efforts are being made to increase tension
 'abhinayta vivek oberoi ne bhi hasan kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki kala or aatankwaad donon kaa koi dharm nahin he
 He asked if Godse's religion was mentioned in order to gain Muslim votes
 pradhanmantri par bani ek byopic main narendra modi kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaale oberoi ne kaha ki kisi ko bhi desh ko vibhajit nahin karnaa chahie
 He tweeted, 'dear Kamal Sir, you are a very big artist
 jaise kala kaa koi dharm nahin hota, thik vaise hi aatankwaad kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 You can say that Godse was a terrorist but why did you use the word Hindu? Because you were trying to get votes in Muslim majority areas? He said, 'please do not divide this country, we are all Jai Hind
