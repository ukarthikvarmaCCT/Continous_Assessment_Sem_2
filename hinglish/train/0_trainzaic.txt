 ise irani film 'sikret ballat' kii kahani par aadhaarit bataaya ja rahaa he
 Director Anurag Kashyap has opened a strong front in support of Newton
 unhone ek fasebuk post ke jariye sabit kiya ki newton, sikret ballat film kii copy nahin he
 Anurag Kashyap has written on Facebook - People who are considering Newton as a copy of Secret Ballet should know what Marco Muller, the producer of Secret Ballet has to say on this
 maine newton ke diarectors se film ke link kii copy lekar marco mular ko bheji
 After watching Newton, Marco Müller said, "this is a very decent film, and of course it is not stolen from the story of our film
" maine jab unase poocha ki kya main unke newton film ko dekhne ke baad is rispons ko soshal media par share kar saktaa hum to unhone saaf kaha haa bilkul aap mere bayaan kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 Please tell that even before this, Anurag Kashyap had come in support of Newton
 unhone twit karke kaha tha-'sikret ballat' se 'newton' utani hi prerit he, jitani ‘da avengers’ (hollywood film) ‘vatan ke rakhwale’ se he
 He said, 'newton' was given the award at the Berlin Film Festival and i can promise that the curators there watch so many films in a year, which we do not see in our whole life
 rajkumaar raav abhinit film ek sarkari karmchaaree ke ird gird gumti he, jo chhattisgarh ke maowad prabhavit kshetra main matdaan kii nigaraanee karne main sangharsh kar rahaa hota he, jabaki ‘sikret ballat’ ek mahila matdaan adhikari kii ek din kii kahani bayaan karti he, jo iran ke logon ko matdaan ke liye rajamand karne kii khatir doordaraj ke ilaake main jaati he
 Newton is an award winner from Berlin Fest and i can promise you those curators watch more films in a year than rest of us do in a lifetime
 — Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72)september 24, 2017"newton" is as much a copy of "secret Ballot" as The Avengers is of Watan Ke Rakhwale— Anurag Kashyap (@anuragkashyap72)september 24, 2017that day when you wake up to the news that a deserving film makes a deserving box office

 Recently, a meme shared by Vivek Oberoi is going viral which has sparked a new controversy
 vivek ne twitor par ek mim share kiya he jisamen ek photo kolaj he
 In the first, Aishwarya is seen with Salman
 duusare main aishwarya kii jodi vivek ke saath dekhi ja sakati he jabaki teesri tasviir main aishwarya apni beti aradhya or pati abhishek sang hai
 This meme has been linked to a joke that people have not liked much
 isamen saaf taur par jhalak rahaa he ki vivek ne aishwarya ke nijee jivan par waar kiya he
 All celebrities and Twitter users are protesting
 haalanki is par vivek kii pratikriya bhi aa gai he or unke nazariye se unhone kuch galat nahin kiya he
 He has also refused to apologize
 ye to rahaa maamla, ab aaiye jaanate hai aishwarya, salmaan or vivek ke bich kii kahani kya he or asal main ye vivaad aakhir kya tha jisane vivek ke kariyar par bura prabhaav daalaa
 When salman-aishwaryaham Dil De Chuke Sanam was the film that laid the foundation for the relationship between Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii is film main saath kaam karte vakt donon ek duusare ke najadik aae the or donon ke bich afaire kii khabaron kii filmi galiyaaron main gunj thi
 But later the situation was not the same
 kai reports main kaha jaataa he ki salmaan ke sakht ravaiyai ke chalate aishwarya ne unase duuri bana lee
 This relationship of love started from the year 1999 did not last very long and by the year 2002, this relationship became more than just a story
 is kahani main ek pahalu vivek oberoi kaa bhi he
 Haha! 👍 creative! No politics here

 com / 1rpbbxzu8t — Vivek Anand Oberoi (@vivekoberoi) May 20, 2019 When Vivek came in the middle, after this Vivek Oberoi knocked in Aishwarya's life
 vivek oberoi un dinon yuva kalakaar the or logon ko pasand the
 The two worked together in the film Kyun Ho Gaya Na Na
 is dauraan donon ke najadik aane kii khabaren saamne ain
 But even this news could not last long
 achaanak hi vivek oberoi ne kuch aisa kar diya jis vajah se naa sirf unka kariyar hi tabah hua balki unke rishte salmaan khan or aishwarya raay donon se hi bighad gaye
 Vivek released the press conference, Vivek Oberoi held a press conference to the surprise of all and said that Salman Khan threatens Aishwarya Rai and attacks Daru's drunk
 salmaan par lagaae gaye vivek ke is aarope par salmaan kii pratikriya to sakht honi hi thi, magar aishwarya ke saath bhi vivek ke rishton main daraaren aa gai
 Salman is badly upset with Vivek and he never talks to Vivek
 haalanki apni galati kaa ehsaas hone par vivek ne salmaan se maafee maangi or aaj tak maangate aa rahe hai magar salmaan apane disijan par adig hai
 At the same time, Aishwarya's distance also increased forever with Vivek and Ash broke up with Vivek
 aish apane jivan main aage bad gayi saal 2007 main aishwarya or abhishek bachchan se shaadi kar lee
 He also has a daughter named Aaradhya by this marriage
 maamle kii baat karen to is par bachchan parivaar kii koi pratikriya nahin ai he
 Neither has any statement come from Salman
 magar agar aisa kuch hota he to vivek kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 Despite opposition from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the Qaumi Ekta Dal (kaued) was finally merged with the Samajwadi Party (SP)
 isse pehle akhilesh ke hath ke aage vilay ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 SP state president Shivpal Yadav said that Mulayam Singh decided to merge
 iske liye akhilesh se bhi salaah lee gai
 With all unhone kaha ki netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) ne kah diya to samajho vilay ho gaya
 However, he also clarified that the merger was decided with the support of all
 pehle se is vilay ke sanket the
 There was a possibility that Mulayam Singh could announce this himself, along with Mukhtar Ansari's brother Afzal Ansari, but when Shivpal Yadav announced a new executive on Thursday, in response to the question asked during the same time unhone ne kaha ki sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ke aadesh par kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay ho chukaa he

 barkhaast mantri rajakishor ke vishay par vichaar-vimarsh chal rahaa he
 "in the new executive announced by Shivpal Yadav on Thursday, everyone is close to Shivpal
 isse saaf he ki party main ek lakeer khinch chuki he
 It is worth mentioning that on 21 June last, Mukhtar Ansari's party Kowed was merged with the SP
 lekin akhilesh yadav ke baari virodh karne ke baad 25 june ko lakhanu main party ke sansadeey board kii baithak hui, jisamen vilay ko radd karne kaa elaan kar diya gaya
 Shivpal Yadav was angered after this, to convince him that Mulayam Singh made him the party state president
 iske baad akhilesh ne ek bada daanv chalate hue shivpal se sabhi bade mantri pad chin liye, iske saath hi shivpal ke kareebi cabinet mantri gayatri prasad prajapati ko bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha
 After this, the political drama, which was born out of a quarrel of uncle and nephew, was witnessed by the whole country
 donon ke bich ruuthane manaane kaa lanbaa daur chalaa
 Finally, Mulayam Singh brought the two people together and Akhilesh was made the chairman of the parliamentary board and Akhilesh also returned all his ministries to Shivpal
 tippaniyan On the merger of Kauaid with SP, BJP state spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, "it will not benefit in any way
 akhilesh kehete hai ki wo turup kaa ikkaa hai, lekin party main unka koi samarthan nahin karata

 ) MLA Amarmani Tripathi, who is serving a sentence in the famous Madhumita murder case, has been out of jail for 2 months on the pretext of illness
 maamle ne tool pakadaa to sarkaar kii neend khuli
 How one can take advantage of political clout, one should learn from former UP minister and MLA Amramani Tripathi
 madhumita shukla hatyakand main aajeevan karawas kii sajaa kaat rahe amarmani kareeb do maheene se jail se baahar hai lekin varanasi jail prashasan ko koi soochna nahin he
 But as soon as the news came that Amramani Tripathi is resting in Varanasi hospital in the name of treatment, DG Special Law and Order Brijlal ordered an inquiry
 varanasi jail prashasan ke mutabik court ke aadesh par amarmani ko maa kii antyeshti main shaamil hone ke liye 13 july ko unke ghar gorakhpur jane kii ijaajat mili thi
 But two days later, the CMO of Gorakhpur Medical College reported that Amarmani has been admitted to the hospital for treatment
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki dabaav badhane par gorakhpur medical college ne amarmani ko 2 sitambar ko pijiai lakhanu refer kar diya
 But no disease was found in the investigation, so the doctors refused to recruit him
 iske baad amarmani lakhanu medical college gaye lekin vahaan bhi aasraa nahin mila or aakhir main wo biechayu aspataal main hi jugad se bhartee ho gaye
 It is clear that the role of Varanasi jail administration as well as the role of doctors and police should also be investigated in this whole case

 By taking out the coils, you are misusing power in a way, are you not? The public did not give you the power to take out the clutches of the parties

 When you step down from power tomorrow, the new rulers will have your coils in their hands
 -- pradhanmantri kaa kahana he ki uttar pradesh main mahilaon ke liye shaam ke vakt baahar nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya he

 Chidambaram reached Lalgarh police station on Sunday
 iske alaava vahaan siarpief camp or ek health centre kaa daura karne ke baad wo midanapur jaaenge
 It is reported that in Lalgarh, he broke the security cordon and met the villagers and held talks
 ek taraf chidambaram logon se mili, to duusari taraf unka virodh bhi hua
 Before Chidambaram reached the area, supporters of Maoist organization PCPA (people's Committee Against Police Atrocities) burnt his effigies
 maovadiyon ne west midanapur ke espi manoj verma ke bhi putale jalaae
 They allege that the government is turning its back on the issue of development
 maovadiyon ne ilaake se suraksha balon ko hataane or oparation green hunt khatm karne kii maang kii he
 After visiting Lalgarh, Chidambaram clearly said that the army would not be used against the Naxalites
 chidambaram ke mutabik naksaliyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan ko keval rajya police or ardhsainik bal hi anjaam degi
 When asked whether the Naxalites are a little calm at the moment, what does it mean? chidambaram ne kaha ki ho saktaa he maovadi phir se sangathit ho rahe hon isliye inpar nigaraanee kii zarurat he
 On the campaign against Naxalites, Chidambaram said that it had some good results but still has some weaknesses
 pashchim bengal ke naksalwad prabhavit ilaakon ke daure par gaye grih mantri pi chidambaram ne maowad virdohi abhiyaan main sena ko shaamil kiye jane se inkaar karte hue maovadiyon ke saamne vaarta kaa taaja prastaav rakhaa he
 Chidambaram, who was on a visit to Lalgarh to review the situation, told Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya during the talks that it was the responsibility of the state government to restore law and order in this regard
 chidambaram ne naksaliyon ko ‘kaayron’ kii sangya di, jo jangalon main chhipe hue hai
 He criticized the Naxalites and said that they were running their activities under the guise of People's Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCPA)

 After a meeting with the top police and administrative officials of the state, Chidambaram told reporters, "no, we are not considering military action against the Naxalites
" naksaliyon se muqabla karne ke liye keval pradesh police, pradesh sashastr police or ardhsainik balon ko tainaat kiya jayega
 Chidambaram said, "we invited the Naxalites for talks, but before that they leave the violence
" agar ve vastav main vikaas chaahate hai, agar ve vastav main logon kii samasyaayein suljhaana chaahate hai, to unka vaarta ke liye swaagat he
 "they said" i told them that we can talk on anything in the world, but they should give up violence
 ’ pisipie dwaara naksaliyon ko kisi bhi tarah ke pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh sahyog par chintaa jataate hue unhone kaha ki agar unhen vastav main koi samasya he, to vah apane pad kaa upyog karte hue pradesh sarkaar or unke bich vaarta sunishchit karenge
 The Home Minister said that he also appealed to the villagers who supported the Maoists not to do so due to fear
 unhone kaha ‘maine unase apil kii ki ve naksalwadiyon ko kisi tarah kaa sahyog na den
 Naxalites cannot develop any kind of people
 ’chidambaram is baat se bhi sahamat hue ki vikaas kii kami ke kaaran graminon ke paas asantusht hone ke kaaran hai
 Chidambaram said, 'I told him that Naxalites are killing you and will continue to kill you
 unki samaaj main koi jagah nahin he
 Chidambaram termed the result of the joint anti-naxal operations of the joint forces as 'mixed' and said that it was necessary to remove some 'deficiencies'
 chidambaram ne kaha ki khufia reporton se sanket mila he ki naksali lagaataar purngathit ho rahe hai or unke khilaaf ladaai ke liye un par satat nigaraanee kii jarurat he
 The Home Minister said that the anti-naxal campaign in West Bengal and Orissa and Jharkhand was a long-ago campaign and it may take two to three years to defeat the Naxalites further
 chidambaram ne kaha ‘iske liye koi taiyaar jawaab nahin he
 Denying the possibility of withdrawal of joint forces from Maoist affected areas, he said that the anti-maoist operation will continue
 grih mantri ne kaha ‘kya sanyukt balon ko waapas lene kaa koi phayda hoga? yah ek lambii chalane vaali prakriya he or ise puraa hone main do se teen saal kaa samay lagegaa
 You have to be patient
 ’ chidambaram ne tippanee kii thi ki puri jimmedaari mukhyamantri karyaalay par aakar rukati he, is par unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ko iske badale sunishchit karnaa hoga ki jimmedaari police adheekshak or stesan house ke adhikari ke karyaalay par jaakar ruke
 He said, "if the responsibility does not go anywhere, then it is a failure of the administrative system
 ’ pisipie ke sandarbh main chidambaram ne kaha ki yah sanghathan police nrushansataaon ke mudde par do november, 2008 ko gathit hua tha
 Chidambaram raised the question 'this organization was made against police atrocities
 ab yah maovadiyon ke liye aad kaa kaam kyon kar rahaa he? pisipie maovadiyon ko pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh sahyog kyon de rahaa he?’ unhone kaha ‘agar unhen kisi bhi tarah kii pareshaani he, to main is baat kaa icchhuk hum ki apane pad kaa upyog karte hue unki pradesh sarkaar ke saath vaarta kii vyavastha karun
 The Home Minister said "whether there is atrocity or not, there can be discussion, but it is a big mistake to help the Naxalites, which they are doing
" ’ duusari ore unhone kaha ki graminon ke paas asantusht hone ke kaaran hai kyonki unke paas shiksha, swasthya, bijli or rashan sambandhi suvidhaayen nahin hai
 Earlier Chidambaram around 08 in the morning

 The police can certainly do more work and find out the truth
 ’pisipie ke sandarbh main chidambaram ne kaha ki jail main band unka netaa chhatradhar mahato or uskaa bhai asit mahato ‘naksalwadiyon kii madad karke logon ke liye acha nahin kar rahe
 'chidambaram advised the leaders of all parties to go to Lalgarh and talk to the villagers
 maovadi hinsa se nipatane ke bare main unhone kaha ‘pashchim bengal kaa mishrit record he or sthiti main sudhaar aana chahie
 'chidambaram said' There have been some advantages in West Bengal, but there are some weaknesses
 urisa or jharkhand kii sthiti sudharne main abhi samay lagegaa or yah ek samasya he

 In Uttar Pradesh, the bjp's Naiya is likely to cross the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ek nae survey ke mutabik, pradesh main bijepi 27 fisadi voton ke saath number ek party ban sakati he
 The survey was conducted by CNN-IBN, The Hindu and csds
 survey ke mutabik, sabase zyada nuksaan bispi ko hoga
 Its votes will be reduced by 8 percent to 21 percent from the previous time
 jabaki espi ko 23 or congress ko 16 fisadi vot milenge
 Forward castes will play an important role in the bjp's comeback, which has previously been in favor of BSP and SP in turn
 duusari ahm vajah hogi, akhilesh sarkaar se mohabhang
 According to the survey, 67 percent of the sp's voters themselves want it to be partially or partially that instead of Akhilesh, cm's chair should be handled by their father Mulayam
 haalanki survey main shaamil 23 fisadi logon ne nahin bataaya ki ve kise vot denge
 Therefore, the results of the survey need to be taken carefully
 bijepi kii ore jhukaav: he bhi yaa nahinupi kii raajnneeti ko samajhane vaale jaanate hai ki jaruri nahin ki survey sach sabit ho
 bjp's PR machinery is the best in the state
 congress virdohi lahar main vah hameshaa jitati hui dikhaai padati he, lekin nattejey kuch or hi aate hai
 It cannot be ignored that 23 per cent of the people in the service have not opened their cards
 survey main choti partiyon kii bhoomika ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 Muslim votes, which play an important role in the victory, can also move here and there
 yah bahut had tak is par nirbhar karegaa ki bijepi modi card kaa kis tarah istemaal karti he
 Old results: Difference between seat and vote percentage: Uttar Pradesh politics is considered to be very volatile
 yahaan kai baar aasaani se najar na aane vaale factor nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaa jate hai
 If we look at the last Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, then too many surveys and analysis have proved to be wrong
 2009 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or congress donon ko 18 fisadi vot mili
 But BJP got 10 seats and Congress got 21 seats
 sabase zyada vot fisad bispi kaa tha, lekin 28 fisadi voton ke baavjood vah tisare number par rahi
 In the 2012 assembly elections, the SP won 224 out of 403 seats
 uskaa vot fisad tha 29
 13
 vot fisadi ke hisaab se bispi mushkil se teen ank peeche thi, lekin use sirf 80 siten milin
 This is unusual because after the 1993 Assembly and 2002 Lok Sabha elections, the political power and leadership in the state has slowly but decisively shifted towards the backward castes

 pita fouj main the or ham log sultanpur aa gaye the
 But when i was four years old, my father died
 meraa ek chota bhai he or badi bahan lakshmi
 You can understand what is the condition of a family without a father
 meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin mujhe khilne main zyada man lagata tha, hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
 meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, 'mara Didi, do not leave
 'bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath, or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring

 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player

 Former Union Minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid, expressing concern over escalating tensions between India and China, said the government would have to be cautious
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main salmaan khurshid ne kaha, 'yah chintaa kaa vishay he
 There are a lot of questions on why this is happening and how it even got to the point
 lekin hamaare desh kii asmita or suraksha kaa sawaal bhi he
 All we can say is that our government needs to be vigilant, not to be deceived, it is a huge responsibility, a great duty to perform and in which the whole country will support
 'sarkaar gambhir nahin he!salmaan khurshid ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki is maamle main sarkaar gambhir nahin he
 He said, 'if the Prime Minister is out at such a time, then the country should know what message to send, what action is being taken
 aisa lagata he ki pradhanmantri isroyal main hi kho gaye hai or vahaan unka swaagat hua he to vah bilkul lupt ho gaye hai kho gaye hai
 This is their own decision
 is samay pradhanmantri ko or sarkaar ko apana puraa dhyaan or puraa samay is samasya ko dena chahie
 It is not prudent to knock the chest and shout
 He said that at this time there is a serious situation in the world
 hamaare liye yah jaruri nahin ki ham bhi usee bhashaa main baat karen, jis bhashaa main china kar rahaa he
 There is a triangle in the whole world and America, China, India
 kiske kaise sambandh banate hai, iskaa puri duniya main bahut vyapak or doorgaami asar hoga
 Therefore, there is a need to work with great understanding and proof, but it is also right that we cannot back down
 chaati thokna or chillaanaa vah bhi bahut samajhadaari kii baat nahin he
 Don't spoil the hard work of 25 years, said Khurshid, "whenever something like this happens, sensible people try to find a solution
" baat ko thanda karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Our China relations were not very good, Rajivji went once again and tried to have a good relationship
 baatcheet shuru hui, bahut had tak ham aage bade hai
 Now whatever is the hard work done in the last twenty 25 years, in which something has been found, China and India have made good relations
 main nahin samajhataa hum ki usko karaab karnaa chahie

" yah na keval bengali hinduon ke liye nuksaandeh he, balki hamaare samaaj ke liye bhi usee tarah se hanikaarak he
 According to sources, Sangh campaigners have also started mobilizing public support in the border districts of Bengal in support of NRC

 Apart from them, the committee includes Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Anant Kumar and Energy Minister Piyush Goyal

 puraani dilli ke chandani chowk main saundaryikaran ko lekar aam aadmi party (AAP) sarkaar ek aayojan karne ja rahi he
 AAP MLA from Chandni Chowk Alka Lamba said that a program will be held at the town hall at 12 noon on 7 December 2018, in which Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be accompanied by ministers Satyendar Jain and Imran Hussain
 darasal, shahjahanabad redeveopment corporation (shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation) ke tahat chandani chowk or jama masjid kaa saundaryikaran hona he
 The court is monitoring the scheme, under which nodal officers have also been appointed
 alka lamba kaa daawa he ki yah corporation shila dikshit sarkaar ke vakt bana, lekin kuch kaam nahin hua
 After this, the bjp-ruled Municipal Corporation also failed to implement this scheme and now the PWD department of Delhi Government has started this work
 alka lamba ne bataaya ki chandani chowk ek aitihaasik jagah he
 From unfurling the first flag of independence, Lal Jain Temple, Shishganj Gurudwara, Church and Old Havelis are here
 unhone kaha ki chandani chowk main jab bhi aag lagati thi, to bijli ke taron ko khatm karne kii maang uthati thi
 Therefore, under this scheme, first the work of under-grounding the wires hanging around BSES houses has been started
 iske alaava dilli jal board ne siver line or pine ke pani kii line bichaane kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 Let us tell you that the PWD department has contacted all the concerned departments to change the picture of Chandni Chowk
 iske liye bisies, jal board ke saath hi landline kii taar bichaane ke lieemtnelki madad lee jaaegi
 On the question of the ban of vehicles, Alka Lamba said that the order of the NGT in Chandni Chowk has been flying
 chaahe wo baari vaahan ko lekar ho yaa phir saamaan ke loding yaa analoding ko lekar ho
 This causes the main roads to face the problem of heavy traffic jams
 unhone aage kaha ki nirmaan kaary chalane ke dauraan bhi vyapaaree yaa rihaayshi logon ko dikkat nahin aegi
 After the completion of this construction work, no heavy vehicles will be able to enter the area
 yahaan amritsar ke golden temple kii tarj par suvidhaayen di jaaengi
 Alka Lamba retaliated against the protest and objection lodged by the BJP and accused the BJP leaders
 unhone kaha, 'bhajpasignechar brij ke baad ab chandani chowk main badlaav kaa virodh kar rahi he
 BJP councilors are making big money in Chandni Chowk through illegal markets and illegal encroachments
 yahi vajah he ki vikaas ke har kaam main bijepi adnga daal rahi he
 The AAP MLA said, 'we have spoken to the traders
 ham lagaataar unke sampark main the
 The traders had said that they are currently facing business of demonetisation and GST, so work should start after Diwali
 'alka lambane aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi ke netaa ab vyapaariyon kii aad lekar virodh kar rahe hai
 However, this scheme is being implemented with the consent of everyone
 bijepi sampradayik rang dekar is yojana ko rokane kii koshish karegi
 Therefore, there is an appeal to the people not to become part of the conspiracy of the BJP
 alka lamba ne ummid jataai ki is yojana ke tahat agle 5 maheene main kaam puraa ho jayega
 In the US, the rate of teenage motherhood has fallen drastically
 yah khulaasa rog niyantran evam rokthaam centre (sidisi) ne apni ek rapat main kiya he
 According to the news agency EFE, the birth rate among adolescents aged 15–19 decreased to almost half during 1991–2011
 1991 main yah janmadar 62 prati 1,000 kishori thi, jo 2011 main ghatakar 31 ho gai
 According to a recent study conducted for 2007–2011, birth rates declined by 25 percent
 lekin latin mul kii yuvatiyon ke bich giravat kii dar kahin zyada, lagbhag 35 pratishat rahi
 Statistician of the cdc's National Center for Health Statistics and report co-author Brady Hamilton said all four states, except North Dakota and West Virginia, had declined at least 15 percent in these four years
 haal kii avadhi main kiye gaye adhyayan ke mutabik, ashwet kishoriyon ke maa banane kii dar main giravat 24 pratishat or shwet kishoriyon main 20 pratishat darj kii gai
 Experts attribute the decline in birthrate to media warnings to prevent unwanted pregnancy and the increased use of contraceptives in first mating
 guuruuvaar, 31 oktober ke din purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii punyatithi he
 Apart from all the usual posts paying tribute to Indira Gandhi on Facebook, a post with a black and white picture is going viral
 is post main lagi tasviir ko lekar daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki indira gandhi ke parthiv sharir ke saamne rajeev gandhi or rahul gandhi 'kalma' (islamic prarthana) pard rahe hai
 Two former Prime Ministers, Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao are seen in this picture
 iske alaava tasviir main rahul gandhi or anya kai congress netaa bhi dekhe ja sakate hai
 In the picture used in the post, a circle is made on the face of Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 tasviir ke saath hindi main capshan likhaa gaya he, 'indira gandhi kii laash ke saamne rahul or rajeev gandhi kalma pard rahe hai phir bhi hamaare desh ke logon ko lagata he ki ye log brahman hai
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne apni padtaal main paaya ki tasviir ke saath kiya ja rahaa daawa galat he
 This picture is not of the funeral of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but of the funeral of freedom fighter and Afghan leader Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, also known as 'frontier Gandhi' or Bacha Khan
 yah post soshal media par pehle bhi viral ho chuki he
 Fact-checking institute 'boom live' has already rejected this claim
 viral ho rahi yah tasviir reverse image search kii madad se internet par khoji ja sakati he jise uttari wajiristaan ke netaa mohsin dower netvitakia tha
 Also 'skyscrapercity
 com' ke archive main bhi yah photo dekhi ja sakati he
 It is mentioned in both these places that this picture is of the funeral of Bacha Khan, in which Gandhi family was involved as well as other Congress leaders
 khan abdul gaffaar khan kaa dehanth 20 janvari, 1988 ko peshawar main hua tha
 Rajiv Gandhi along with his family and other leaders went to Pakistan to attend his funeral
 ise lekar kai antarrashtriya media sansthaanon jaise'la Times'ne khabaren bhi prakashit kii thim
 Indira Gandhi died on 31 October 1984 and her last rites were performed in Hindu manner
 unke antim sanskaar ke drishy yahaan isvideomen dekhe ja sakate hai
 It is thus clear that the claim made in the viral post is wrong that in front of the body of Indira Gandhi, the Gandhi family is cremating her by Islamic custom
 viral tasviir main jis parthiv sharir ke saamne rajeev gandhi or rahul gandhi khadey hai, vah indira gandhi kaa nahin, balki 'seemaant gandhi' ke naam se mashhoor khan abdul gaffaar khan kaa parthiv sharir he
 Before the Supreme Court's decision in the Ayodhya case, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday asked party workers and spokespersons to refrain from making emotional and inflammatory statements in the Ram temple case
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne bhi kuch din pehle apane prachaarkon ko isi tarah kaa paraamarsh jari kiya tha
 According to sources, the central leadership of the BJP in a meeting of party spokespersons, media and social media departments across the country asked them to refrain from making unnecessary statements on the subject of Ram temple
 iske saath hi bhaajapa kii soshal media ikai ke pramukh amit malviya ne bhi party kii soshal media tiimon ko is bare main jaankaree di ki is tarah ke manchon par vivaadaaspad bayaan dene se kaise bachein
 Senior officials of the Sangh had recently said in a meeting of campaigners that the Vijay Mandir should not be celebrated or the procession should not be taken if the Ram Mandir decision is in favor
 vahiin ayodhya ke sthaneey prashasan ne faisle par ‘vijay' yaa ‘shok' manaane ke liye koi bhi kaarykram yojit karne par roak laga di he
 District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha on Saturday ordered a ban on social media to 'insult' the gods or install an idol and take out a procession in connection with Ram Janmabhoomi

 All the family members were convinced on the words of Mehjabin and Sabyasachi but the mastermind Vikas Gupta came to know all their lies
 vikaas ne na sirf mehjabeen ko expored kiya balki lav ke jhooth se bhi pardaa uthaa diya
 When two neighbors, Lucinda and Luv, came out of the house, Love took advantage of knowing Hindi and convinced the family to save themselves
 iske baad lav ne apana asli rang dikhaanaa shuru kiya or gharavaalon ke saath corpet karnaa band kar diya

 According to the report of the International Labor Organization, sexual harassment is a special form of gender discrimination in the case of sex, which shows the non-equal relationship of power between men and women
 auraton ke khilaaf bhedbhaav ke tamaam roopon ke khatme par sanyukt raashtra sandhi (siidiedblyoo) maang karti he ki ''kaarysthal par yonutpeedan or hinsa ke duusare roopon yaa jor-jabardastee se mahilaon kii raksha ke upaay'' kiye jaaen
 Sexual harassment can occur in various forms
 isamen pahanaave, nijee bartaav yaa sharir ko lekar tikaa-tippanee karne sareekhe maukhik yaa likhit rup, yon yaa ling aadhaarit latife, yon anugrah kii guzarish karnaa yaa baahar chalane ke liye baar-baar kahana, yon ishaare karnaa, nijee yaa yon jindagi ke bare main afvaahen failaana, yon prakruti ke i-mail yaa text massej bhejkar dhamkee dena shaamil he
 It can be physical in nature and can take the form of an attack, getting close or stopping the path, touching, kissing, hugging, thrashing, moving, rubbing, nonchalantly
 isamen sharir ko upar se neeche tak ghoorna, yon prakruti ke apmanjanak haavbhaav yaa shaklein bananaa or peechha karnaa shaamil he
 Visual forms of sexual harassment include posting or sharing posters, drawings, photographs, screensavers, e-mails or text of a sexual nature, and playing music that produces sexual arousal
 yon utpeedan kaa sabase ahm lakshan yah he ki yah naapnsad or avaanchit hota he, baar-baar kiya jaataa he, aksar isamen sex ke evaj main peshey se judi meharbaaniyaan inayat kii jaati hai or yah kaamkaaj main aswasth tathaa dushmani kaa maahaul banaata he
 Reports of sexual harassment come from all over the world
 skulon main bacchon se lekar kaarysthalon par vibhinn prakaar kii paristhitiyon main yon utpeedan tak dheron report ham padhate rahete hai
 Most women remain silent about sexual harassment, despite the psychological impact it can have
 saamaajik kalank lagane, sambhavit taur par apni naukari jane, kariyar ke bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaon par kharaab asar padane, ise gopneey rakhane ko lekar asal chintaaen, sharmindagi or badanaami jhelane ke dar kii vajah se parivaar kaa dabaav or bhavishya ke nijee sarokaar (shaadi or rishton par iskaa kya asar padegaa) aksar sankochi auraton ko yon utpeedan yaa durvyavhaar kii shikaayat karne se rokte hai
 It often happens that instead of filing a complaint, women leave the workplace or educational institution
 in shikayaton ko dabaane kaa nateeja peedit mahila ke bare main unheen ghisi-pity baton kii shakl main saamne aata he ki aparaadh karne vaale ko badhaava dene main kisi na kisi rup main vah bhi shaamil yaa jimmedaar thi, jisase maahaul or zyada kharaab hota he
 As the Chairman of the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of an institution and as a postgraduate teacher, my concerns about these issues stems from a number of comfort points, including the media and academia
 pehali chintaa har tarah ke kaarysthalon par is bare main jaagrukta kii had ko lekar he ki yon utpeedan aakhir kya he or kis tarah isaki shikaayat karne or ise thik karne kaa adhikaar hasil he
 While the Women Sexual Harassment at Workplace (prevention, Prohibition and Reform) Act 2013 provides legal support, many victims of such harassment are reluctant to come forward with their complaints
 saamaajik vajahon ke alaava iske peeche sabase badi vajahon main se ek yah aam chintaa hoti he ki naam uchhaala jayega
 The law requires that a written complaint be lodged in the ICC, but very few women are willing to file a written complaint
 ek aam dharna yah he ki inamen se zyaadaatar shikaayatein puraane hisaab chuktaa karne kii garaj se kii jaati hai yaa tab kii jaati hai jab rajamandi se banaae gaye rishte main khatas paidaa ho jaati he
 Such reasons are the exception
 kanoon sulah kii ijaajat detaa he, jiskaa matlab he ki agar aaropee shikaayat karne vaale kii tay sharton (maafinama, shapathpatr ki vah khaas duracharan doharaaya nahin jayega, madad maangane ke liye samjhauta, vagairah) kaa paalan karne ko raji ho jaataa he, to maamle ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important as a measure of correction, especially when the harassment occurred because the accused was not aware that what he was doing was unacceptable and against the law
 iskaa matlab he ki logon ko jaagruk banaaya janaa chahie ki avaanchit prastaavon par dotuk 'naa' kaise kaha jaae, kaise or kab pahachaanaa jaae ki peshkash thukraa di gai he or kadam peeche khinch liye jaaen, or pesheygat rishton main ulanghan kii seemaa rekha kya ho sakati he
 As a mental health professional, i get stuck on two basic issues
 pehla yah he ki samaaj ke badalte ravaiyon ke bich kai purush-striyon ke man main baari uljhan rahati he ki viksit ho rahe ek bhaavnaatmak rishte main sex kii bhoomika kya he, aapasi rajamandi aakhir kya he or jor-jabardastee kya he
 Merely a wrong decision often leads to undesirable consequences
 kam umr main yon sakriyata ek ahm samasya he jo baad kii jindagi main kai kism kii mushkilon kii taraf le ja sakati he
 Therefore, the burden of responsibility falls on the educational institutions and workplaces, which may not be fully prepared to handle such issues
 tamaam kaarysthalon or shaikshik sansthaanon main ek anivaary isisi honi chahie
 Finally, it is necessary to investigate all such complaints by following the principles of natural justice, so that atrocities of any kind can be prevented

 *** Amid the ongoing tussle between the government and the opposition over the Lokpal Bill, a BJP MP made a revelation which is a matter of concern for the government
 rajyasabha ke saansad eses ahaluvalia ke mutabik ek vicitra sanyog he ki sansad main jab jab lokapal vidheyak charchaa ke liye aayaa tab tab loksabhaa bhang ho gai
 He said that this has been happening since 1968
 us varsh nau may ko lokapal or lokayukta vidheyak pesh kiya gaya tha
 It was referred to the Select Committee of Parliament
 loksabhaa main yah lokapal evam lokayukta vidheyak, 1969 ke rup main 20 agast 1969 ko paarit hua
 However, before this bill was passed in Rajya Sabha, the fourth Lok Sabha was dissolved and the bill was also repealed
 iske baad 11 agast 1971 ko doosraa lokapal evam lokayukta vidheyak pesh kiya gaya
 It was neither sent to any committee nor was it passed in the House
 paanchavin loksabhaa ke bhang hone ke saath hi yah vidheyak bhi khatm ho gaya
 After this, a bill to this effect was brought on 28 July 1977
 ise sansad ke donon sadanon kii sanyukt pravar samiti ko bheja gaya
 The Sixth Lok Sabha was dissolved before the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee and the Bill was also abolished
 apni birdari main bhaichara or miljulkar kaam karnaa aam baat he, lekin muslim samudaay ke sanghathanon dwaara hinduon ke jivan main badlaav laane kii misaalen nihsandeh badale hue samaaj main sampradayik sadbhaav ko majoobati pradaan karti hai
 One such example was seen in Patna, Bihar, where the Muslim Co-operative Credit Society has changed the lives of thousands of Hindu families by providing interest-free loans
 kamala devi, pankaj kumaar, gita devi or sanjay singh unheen pariwaron main se aate hai jinako alkhar ko-oparative credit sosayadi limited ne roji-roti ke liye apana kaarobaar khadaa karne ke liye byajmukt rin pradaan kiya
 Around 9,000 Hindus have been provided loans by this society to build businesses
 inamen vendor, chote kaarobaari, patariyon par dukaan chalaane vaale, seemaant kisaan or mahilaayein mukhyataur par shaamil hai
 Kamla, who runs a shop in Patna's Mirshikar Toli, told IANS, "I used to sell potatoes and onions on roadside tracks
 iske liye 2,000 se 5,000 rupee sahukaaron se sood par karj leti thi or unke karj tale hameshaa dabe rahati thi
 But a few years ago, i was surprised when someone said that the Alkhar Society gives loans without interest
 ' dukaan chalaane ke liye unhone sabase pehle sosayadi se 10,000 rupee karj liya
 He then took a loan from the society from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000
 kamala ne kaha, 'sosayadi se karj lekar maine chote se khomache kii dukaan se apana kaarobaar badhaakar aaj thok kii dukaan khol lee he
 'kamla now has so much money that she is able to arrange for the education of both her sons
 unka ek betaa enginiring college main padhata he or doosraa bied kar rahaa he
 Kamla said that she pays some of her earnings as an installment to the Alkhar Society so that the debt can come off
 alkhar sosayadi ne pichley ek dashak main islamic mulyon kaa paalan karte hue kareeb 20,000 logon ko 50 karod rupee kaa karj pradaan kiya he
 Most of them include those who were struggling to make a living
 sosayadi ke labhaarthiyon main takreeban 50 fisadi hindu hai
 It is evident that the Alkhar Society helps the needy by rising above religious discrimination
 kamala kii tarah gita devi ne bhi sadak kinare subjiyon kii apni choti dukaan kii jagah ab badi si dukaan khol lee he
 He has also helped his son open a vegetable shop
 gita ne bataaya, 'alkhar sosayadi ke sampark main aane ke baad meri jindagi badal gai
 It helped us live a life of honor
 hamaare jaise garib logon ke liye byajmukt karj bhagwaan kaa vardaan hi he
 There is no uncertainty of getting a loan like banks here
 'ek or labhaarthi sanjay singh ne kaha ki choti dukaan chalaane waalon ko karj dene main bainkon kii koi dilchaspee nahin hoti
 He said, 'not only does the bank charge interest on the loan, it also needs to fill so many documents to take the loan that the poor man gets upset
 ' sanjay ke paas kapade kii choti si dukaan he, jo unki patni chalaati he or vah cycle par gum-gum kar kapade bechata he
 Shamim Rizvi, a bank official who has been associated with the Alkhar Society for nearly a decade, said, "interest-free loans may be a Muslim tradition because interest in Islam is considered unfair
 magar yah (alkhar sosayadi) na sirf muslim balki sabhi dharm ke logon ko byajmukt karj detii he
 Naykar Fatmi, managing director of the Alkhar Society, told IANS that the interest-free loan trend was increasing
 unhone kaha, 'jinaki pahunch bank tak nahin ho paati he unke liye paanch se 10,000 rupee kii choti rakam bhi kaaphi ahm hoti he
 About 50 percent of the people who get interest-free loans are Hindus
 zyaadaatar log apni roji-roti chalaane ke liye karj lete hai jisase unka shashaktikaran ho rahaa he
 The Alkhar Society exemplifies a successful microfinance organization offering interest-free loans
 yah hajaaron logon ke chehron par muskaan laai he
 The society started with a small fund and initially had only two employees in a small office in Patna
 magar aaj sanstha main 100 karmchaaree kaam karte hai
 For the salary, office rent and other expenses of these employees, they charge nominal service charges from the borrowers
 muslim samudaay ke kuch padhe-likhe logon ke saath varsh 2000 ke aarambh main is sanghathan kii neenv rakhi gai thi
 The organization's objective was to provide financial help to the needy people irrespective of religion, caste and class

 Kalikho Pul demoted as Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh within just 5 months

 Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has again created a controversy and this time he has questioned the ability of India's master batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid
 pakistan ke purv cricketer shoeb akhtar ne apni jeevani main kiye hai ajeebogareeb daawey
 India's great cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was afraid of Shoaib's ball
 ye daawa kiya gaya he tenge gendbaaji ke liye mashhoor shoeb kii jeevani controvarshili yorse main
 In this book, Rawalpindi Express has also claimed that he had cheating in the IPL
 shoeb kii jeevani main ipel main dhokhaa dene kaa aarope laga he shahrukh khan or ipel ke purv chairman lalit modi par
 The controversial Pakistani player said in his autobiography 'controversially Yours' that Tendulkar was afraid to face his speed on the Faisalabad track
 unhone yah bhi daawa kiya he ki tendulkar or dravid match vijeta nahin hai or na hi ve match jeet par samaapt karne kii kala jaanate hai
 Akhtar said in his book, 'there are many great batsmen like Vivian Richards, Ricky Ponting, Brian Lara and those who dominated the bat and were truly match winners
 shuru main jab maine sachin ko gendbaaji kii to mujhe unamem in gunon kii kami dikhaayi di
 He may have scored so many runs and records but he lacks the ability to finish the match
 ’ is tej gendbaaj ne is saal vishwa cap ke dauraan apane sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 He also gave an example in which he felt that Tendulkar was afraid to face him
 akhtar ne kaha, ‘sachin tennis albo se peedit the jiskaa shrinkhalaa main hamen phayda hua or isse is mahaan ballebaaj ke pradarshan par kaaphi asar padaa
 He said, 'we bothered him with a bouncer
 main tab pehle din dressing room main aayaa to mujhe pataa chalaa ki sachin tej or oochaal bhari gendon kaa saamana karne main sahaj mahasoos nahin karte
 He was very uncomfortable against me and that was enough to bowl against him
 ’akhtar ne likhaa, ‘maine sachin ko tej gend phenki jise usne chuaa tak nahin, yah mere liye hairat bharaa tha
 He turned away
 aisa pehali baar tha jab maine use mujhase dur hatate hue dekha tha or vah bhi faisalabad kii dhimi pich par
 In the next match i hit him on the head and he could not score after that
 ’36 varshiya akhtar ne kaha ki tendulkar or dravid match vijeta nahin hai jo milakar 56,000 antarrashtriya ran (tendulkar dwaara 33,000 or dravid ke 23,000 se upar) jod chuke hai
 He said, 'I think Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid were not match winners from the beginning nor did they know the art of ending matches in cricket

 Aamir Khan is in the news due to his film Secret Superstar
 is film main jaayra wasim mukhya bhoomika main hai or aamir khan sahaayak bhoomika main
 In such a situation, the question arises whether Aamir Khan will get less fees from the lead actor? When a journalist asked Aamir this question, he replied, 'I will probably not get a check for less than Zaira
 filmon main pement ke hamaare paas do str hai
 One for the work that you are doing and what i am doing is also equal to another actor
 sabko baraabar paisa milanaa chahie
 Similarly, i feel that technicians should also get equal money as actors
 aamir khan ne kaha ye fact he ki filmon main aapaki fees is baat par nirbhar karti he ki darshakon ko theatre tak laane main aapkaa kya yogadan he
 There are two or three people in each team who pull the audience to the theater
 duusare yah kaam nahin kar sakate
 This is called stardom
 ye log eaar rahamaan, saleem-javed yaa koi or ho saktaa he
 The day Zaira will be more capable of pulling the audience, on that day he will surely get more fees
 ye gender ke aadhaar par tay nahin hoga
 Aamir had heard in the bathroom the script of 3 Idiot, opened his secret about the success that the matter of giving fee to the female actor equal to the mail actor has already arisen
 is par bollywood actress apni raay kuch is tarah de chuki hai
 Anushka Sharma- In our industry, its equivalent female actor gets a quarter of the fees as compared to a male actor
 sochie ki dresses or accessories par hamaara kharch hamaari inakam kaa 40 fisadi hota he
 Priyanka Chopra - i was told that female actors can be replaced, because they can stand behind anyone
 aaj bhi duniyabar main mail actor kii tulana main actraces ko kam fees di jaati he
 Kangana Runot- My mail counter part is paid three times more fees than mine
 phir bhi film ke safal hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin hoti
 Why this inequality? sonam kapur- ye prectical sosayadi he
 There is greater gender inequality here
 mujhe abhi bhi fees, shooting ke liye bajet aadi paane main mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he

 The commitment to end hate crime there and the country's penal laws requires that one first recognize the prejudice behind such crimes being committed

 Uttar Pradesh topped the Hate Crime incidents in all the states of the country
 sitambar 2015 se june 2019 ke bich uttar pradesh main 216 aise aparaadh report hue
 Aakar Patel, associated with Amnesty International India, did not follow the Supreme Court's guidelines, 'unfortunately, there is no accurate information about the incidence of Hate Crime in India
 kyonki kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar yahaan kanoon het krime kii alag aparaadhon ke taur par pahchaan nahin karata
 The result is that government data is not available regarding the motive behind the crimes
 kathith het krime kii ghatnaon main khatarnaak dhang se badhotaree saaf taur par bataati he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ke dishanirdeshon par amal kii kami rahi
 This led to a lack of accountability and increased audacity over such crimes

 At the same time, the state governments were asked to take effective steps to stop the mob violence
 sirf rajasthan or manipur hi aise rajya hai jinhone sambandhit kanoon paas kiye
 Answer of the central government, on the other hand, the central government says that the state governments are able to enact laws on 'mob lynching'

 It reduces the horrors of crime

 The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publishes annual statistics on crime incidents
 lekin 2016 ke baad se isane 'bharat main aparaadh' kii report jari nahin kii he
 Aakar Patel said, "with regard to Hate Crime, it is necessary to classify data based on the type and nature of crime and report the data at all levels
" isamen reporting, jaanch, abhiyojan or sajaa sabhi str shaamil hai
 It is imperative that the investigating officer investigate the suspected hate crime swiftly, impartially and on all aspects
 saath hi unhone kaha, 'prasicution adhikariyon ko chahie ki jab paryaapt saboot maujuud hon to wo bhedakaari makasad ko court ke sangyaan main laaen

 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has directed a scheme to distribute free saris to poor women in order to deal with the atmosphere against the Samajwadi Party (SP) government in UP after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan sapa ne apane ghoshnaa patr main garib mahilaon ko ek varsh main do saadiyaan free dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 Even after one and a half years after the formation of the government, this plan was not able to come into reality due to many reasons
 is saal farvari main paarit sarkaar ke bajet main free sari baantne ke liye 800 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha lekin saadiyon kaa rang, unki lambaai ko lekar ek raay na banane se yojana adhar main lataki thi

 It has been decided that the color of the saree should not be such that it matches the color of the flag of any political party
 adhikari bataate hai ki mukhyamantri ne free bantane vaali saadiyon kaa rang aisa rakhane kii salaah di he jisase vah gandi na dikhe
 Panchayati Raj Minister Balaram Yadav says, 'the scheme will be started in the next month

 Suryanarayan Babu wrote this letter to Mahatma Gandhi from Darbhanga jail
 neeche ham is patr ko jyon kaa tyon de rahe hai
 Pujya Bapu, Regards Pranamadarbhanga district, such is the situation today, in the Congress cabinet which is running the repression cycle here today, the way the alliance of landlords and government employees is oppressing the people and workers, today anyone can see with an eye on it Don't know chaaron ore andhkaar hi andhkaar he
 If there had been such oppression and oppression here in the government today, the columns of the national newspapers of the province would have been filled with thick letters against it and the voice of our leaders would also have been raised against it, as it always was before today
 
 lekin aaj congressi mantrimandal main jahaan prantiy rashtriya akhabaaron ne apana munh band kar rakhaa he, hamaare congressi netaaon ko bhi is ore dekhne or sochane kii fursat nahin, jila congress kamitiyon kaa haal to auki bhi badtar he
 Due to election rigging, today such people are at the peak, who do not even disturb the terrible well-being of the public life of the district, at such a time, if we have any hope from anyone, then it can be you who have always for truth and justice
 He has kept his life at stake
 gat march se hi is jile ke adhikariyon kaa daman chakra ham samaajawaadee kaaryakartaaon par chalane laga, lekin ab to is krur daman chakra kaa shikaar ham samaajwaadiyon se prabhavit kisaan majdoor bhi hone lage hai
 In the last March, when a severe food crisis had started across the district, hungry people were craving food in every corner of the district, the thief market was very hot and there were reports of starvation from everywhere
 Organized Bhukkhad demonstrations in Darbhanga and Madhubani
 sabha karke, juluus nikaalkar adhikariyon kaa dhyaan ann sankat kii ore aakrisht karne kii koshish kii, par nateeja ulta hua
 Instead of treating the merge properly, the government adopted a repression policy
 kuch dinon kii chuppi ke baad hi na jane kis gupt mantranaa kii prerana se jila ke adhikariyon ne waar karnaa pranrabh kiya
 Our comrades were made victims of Bihar 'maintenance of Public Order Act'
 jis kanoon kaa nirmaan upyog dhadlle ke saath kisaan-mazdooron kii sabhaaon or reliyon ko rokane ke liye khun pasinaa ek kar diya or jinke safal prayaas kaa likhit pramaan patr bhi collector ne diya, is kanoon kii jaal main fansaaya jane laga
 Without taking into account the real purpose of this law, civil liberties started being hijacked under its guise
 gaanv-gaanv main 144 dhara lagu kar sabhi prakaar kii sabhaaon or juluson par roak laga di
 In the same indictment, our chosen comrades were arrested and imprisoned
 falat: is anuchit giraftaar ke virodh main gat 18 april ko jila ke aginat kisaan mazdooron ne, jinamein hindu-musalmaan, aurat mard sabhi shaamil the, atyant utsaah ke saat shantimay pradarshan main bhaag liya
 This was the first time in the demonstrations in this district
 jabaki logon ne hajaaron kii taadaad main hindu-musalamaanon ko ek saath dekha
 Even then, the government accused these protesters of spreading riots and beat up thousands of men and women by lathis by the police
 lariyon main bhar-bhar kar logon ko dur chauron main phinkavaya
 The scene of 1931 came right before the eyes
 is tarah ke julm kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye shame kii baat ho sakati he
 The most excruciating thing was that women were brutally lathi-charged, dragged onto the streets and profanity abused
 rashtriya jhandon ko fadkar unase juute ponche gaye or is silsile main us din 97 vyaktiyon ko giraftaar kar jail main band kar diya gaya
 Here, from the time of the discussion of the breakdown of the zamindari, how the landlords have been bent on evicting the farmers from the allotted land, you must have come to know from the letter of the Provincial Kisan Sabha Chairman, Pt
 Ramanand Mishra
 jahaan kisaan apane kanoonee hakon ko chhodana nahin chaahate, vahaan jameendaar lathaiton or kiraye ke gundon ke jariye jabardastee unhen jameen se bedakhal karne kii cheshtaa karte hai
 At the same time, lawsuits are imposed on those farmers
 jameendaaron ke paas rupee hai
 They can easily benefit from using it
 iske atirikt jamaane main ore se chor tak vyaapt mahangaai or abhaav ne dhaniyon ke sukhon ko bhi kuch kam kar diya he, iskaa asar afasaron ke dimag par bada gaharaa he
 The reaction to the grief of someone who was unhappy all day has become natural, but the sadness of the one who was always happy also creates a serious reaction
 jameendaaron kii auraten apane pine ke liye khud kune se pani bharen, itnaa hi hamamen se samudaay ko dravit kar detaa he, lekin jo auraten dusron ke liye bhi apane bachapan, javaani or budhaape bhar pani bharti rahati hai, kisi ko nahin khalataa
 Then there is some consciousness among farmers and landlords
 isse unhen irshyaa hoti he
 Especially the SDO of Sadar Subdivision of Darbhanga has said that the farmer movement will be suppressed whatever way it is, this is where we got the instruction from above
 kisaanon or kisaan kaaryakartaaon ko pareshaan karne ke liye saikadon jhuthe mukademe abhi jila bhar main un par chal rahe hai
 Due to these rigging, the way farmers across the district are being destroyed, it would not be inappropriate to mention two-four of them as a sample
 jagadishpur, thana baheda, darbhanga main san 1939 isvi main hi kisaanon ne apane hakon kii ladaai kii, goliyaan khain, panchayat hui or tatkaaleen jiladhikari ne kisaanon ke un jameenon ko jameendaar dakhal karnaa chaahate he, darjanon mukademe kisaanon ko tabah karne ke liye chalaae gaye
 Bullets were threatened, but it was decided to hand over all the matters to the farmers
 teen panch chune gaye
 But SDO b
 choudhary ke aate hi sara maamla palat gaya
 After secret consultations, the landlord requested that the trial of the case be on merit
 phir kya tha? 107 kii dhara main kisaanon se turant hi lagbhag dedh lakh kaa muchalaka maanga gaya
 Farmers were captured and jailed and their houses were looted in their absence, and all kinds of slaves were taken without any weight
 jameendaaron ko saath le police afasar logon ke gharon main ghus kar lutate or kisaanon ko aatankit kar pareshaan karne kii koshish karte hai
 Legal action is also taken in such a way that work outside the law can also be included in it
 is tarah kii karrwai samooche jile main kii ja rahi he
 The farmer activists who were caught, kept them in the closet as prisoner for 24 hours without any food and water at the same zamindar Babu, where the banquet was organized to commemorate the Shraddha, and on requesting food, the inspector gave him sticks
 aisa isliye kiya gaya jisase kisaan kaaryakarta kaa aam kisaanon main asar kam ho jaae or jameendaaron kaa rob un par chaa jaae
 There are similar tales of Atthar and Ilamas Nagar as well
 atahar kaa khooni jameendaar jisane 25 march ko ek kisaan ke bachche kaa chupake se khun kar daalaa he, aaj maje main ghumta he, lekin sadar darbhanga ke esadio bi
 Chaudhary has kept the farmers there in jail under Section 107
 yahaan tak ki esajo ne aise aadamiyon ke bhi jail main band kar diya he jinamein do ko keval dekhne maatr se jiladhikari ne chhod dene kaa vachan de diya
 However, they are yet to be released
 unamem se ek to donon aankh kaa andhaa he or barason se is tarah suja hua he ki aasaani se chal phir bhi nahin saktaa
 In Khanpur, Bikrampur and other similar villages, the SDO has implemented 144 sections
 military posting he, kisaan pite, khud esadio kii dekh-rekh main kisaanon kii fasalon ko jot kar barbaad kar diya gaya, aisi haalat main, main vahaan esadio ke faisle ke viruddh kisaanon ko salaah dene gaya lekin mere vahaan pahunchate hi samastipur esadio babu balram singh bhi pahunche or unhone mujhe sabha karne kaa apradhi bataaya
 i told him that it was wrong to come to the meeting at sixteen
 is par unki bhaven tan gayi or unhone mujhase poocha- em ai erest dein? yah ,baat mujhe betuki lagi, maine kaha- dait me bi best non tu yor self
 The bus forced me to ride the lorry and my rented car remained there
 mujhe hi nahin, mujhe khaanaa khilaane vaale saathi ko bhi giraftaar kiya gaya or aaj main si class criminal kii jindagi vyateet kar rahaa hum
 Is this the rule for which i have been fighting for sixteen years as an honest soldier of the Congress? Is it not true that the dogs that have been fat by snatching our flesh till today, i am still a victim of them and earlier where they used to do this under the umbrella of enemies, today all this is happening at the behest of our friends? Bapu Adarsh Is it so disgusting to get on the ground that it creates hatred? You are the last thread of hope, which breaks the possibility of a catastrophic explosion that will make years of companions and friends enemies of each other

 He started thinking of himself as God
 uske atyaacharon se teenon lok pareshaan ho uthe
 He started torturing people in various ways
 lekin hiranyakashyap kaa putr prahlada bhagwaan vishnu kaa bhakt tha
 He prevented Prahlada from doing devotion to Vishnu and tried to kill him
 ek din prahlada ne apane pita se kaha ki bhagwaan vishnu har jagah maujuud hai, to hiranyakashyap ne use chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar tumhaare bhagwaan sarvatra hai, to is stambh main wo kyon nahin dikhte? ye kehane ke baad usneus stambh par prahaar kiya
 Then Lord Vishnu appeared in an incarnation from the pillar
 yah aadha maanav aadha sher kaa rup tha
 He took Hiranyakashipu and took him to the threshold of the palace
 bhagwaan narsingh ne use apni jaanghon par litaakar uske seene ko nakhunon se faad diya
 At the place where Lord Narasimha killed Hiranyakashyap, at that time he was neither inside the house nor outside, neither day nor night, Lord Narasimha was neither fully human nor animal

 Used his nails, not weapons

 world cap 2015 main pakistan ke khilaafpichhali baar ke champiyanon kii dahaad ne puri duniya kaa dhyampani ore khinchaa
 The win against Pakistan is a positive start for a team that has been craving for a win for the last three months
 haal ke maheenon main team india kaa kamjor pradarshan uske semifinal main pahunchane kii ummiido ko halkaa bana detaa he
 But things are now happening in favor of Team India
 pakistan ke khilaaf jeet ke baad team india ke ranbankure naa keval apane pairon par khadey hai, balki jis tarah andaaj main pakistan ko chit kiya, usne karodon bharatiyon kaa dil jeet liya
 Against Pakistan, India raised their level of play in every field and a win would definitely boost their morale
 lekin africa sher sirf spin ke saamne dher hone se rahe bharat ko apni jeet kaa silsilaa banaae rakhane ke liye south africa ke khilaaf atirikt prayaas karne honge
 On the other hand, South Africa would like to remove the tag of chokers in the World Cup
 south africa ne world cap main bharat ke haathon kabhi maat nahin khai he
 Therefore, India should not lose sight of the victory against Pakistan and should focus on the next match
 1
 Extra Special in Bowling If you have analyzed Indian bowling in the last three months, then you will see that the bowlers have surprised everyone
 haalanki karodon bharatiyon ko khush karne vaale gendbaajon ke saamne ab south africa kii chunauti he
 With the new ball, the bowlers will have to take wickets rather than give the Africans a chance to open the run
 2
 half-chance's victory against Catchopakistan concealed the mistakes made in the fielding, but such mistakes against South Africa could be a big draw
 lihaaja half chance ko phul chance bananaa hoga
 The lions of the Indian subcontinent will have to catch opportunities that will be rarely, but significant
 3
 Not throwing wickets in bunches The biggest reason for India's defeat against South Africa in the last World Cup was the sudden collapse of Indian batting
 1 wicket par 267 ran banane vaali team india 296 ran par ol out ho gai, lihaaja aakhir main team ko isaki keemat haar ke rup main chukaani padi
 Team India will have to avoid such negligence, because even against Pakistan, the team's batting suddenly collapsed in the death overs
 south africa ke khilaaf team ko is chunauti se paar paanaa hoga
 4
 wicket bachaa ke rakhopakistan ke khilaaf team india ne shuru main wicket nahin ganvaae or yahatim ke liye mahatvapoornsabit hua
 In front of Dale Steyn, Veron Philander and Morne Morkel, the team's batsmen will have to adopt the same strategy
 5
 MS Dhoni's specialty as captain has been the attacking of the opposition team with the spinners hanging on Dhoni's captainboard
 south africa ke khilaadi spin ke khilaaf camoger rahe hai
 Therefore, the spinners of the Indian team should keep hunting African players at fixed intervals
 agar aswin ko chhod diya jaae, to kisi or bharosa karnaa jyaadati hogi
 On the other hand, in recent years Melbourne Cricket Ground has not been a pleasant ground for bowlers who spin with support
 lihaaja aswin or jadeja ko is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 In such circumstances, it will be a challenge for Dhoni to try bowling options and keep the options open for attack
 aise main dhoni kii captaini ke liye yah ek bada imtihaan hone ja rahaa he

 Love you Bhai 😘A post shared byarpita Khan Sharma(@arpitakhansharma) onapr 8, 2018 at 11:27pm PDT Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati is getting a lot of support from fans and celeb after the protest
 lekin aise kai film star bhi hai, jinhone film ke content par aapatti jataai he
 Actress Swara Bhaskar has also posted her open letter published in The Wire, after watching the film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavat
 i loved the performances by all the actors in # Padmaavat- The film is seductive in its grandeur, scale, beauty, power of its actors’s performances, music, design, vision
 
 
 and therein lies the problem! Some thoughts
 
 sorry abt the length 🙈🙈🙈https: / / t
 co / 0hynvlavad— Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara)january 27, 2018unhone apane open letters kii shuruyaat ‘at The End of Your Magnum Opus


 i Felt Reduced to a Vagina – Only’ heading se karte hue kii he
 Swara has written that through this film, Bhansali has glorified Sati and Jauhar
 swara film ke jariye striyon kii pesh hui chhavi se bahut naaraaz hai
 At the beginning of the open letter, Swara Bhaskar did Bhansali and praised the stars who worked in the film
 aage unhone likhaa ki mahilaon ko ‘vajaina’ ke taur par simit kar diya he
 At the end of the film, on the scene of Rani Padmavati burning herself to protect the honor, she writes, 'sir, women have the right to be alive apart from being victims of rape
 ''padmavat' dekh sari raat so nahin saki ye mashhoor actresspurush kaa matlab aap jo bhi samajhate ho- pati, rakshak, maalik, mahilaon kii sexuality tay karne vaale, unki maut ke baavjood mahilaon ko jivit rahane kaa haq he
 Swara adopting a more strident stance further, says, "women are not moving around
 haa mahilaon ke paas yah ang hota he lekin unke paas or bhi bahut kuch he
 Therefore, the entire life of the people should not be spent focusing on Vajina, controlling it, protecting it, keeping its purity
 ’maine padmavat dekhi, hinsa karne vaale rajputon kaa ho bahishkaraswara yah bhi maanati hai ki yah film aitihaasik tathyon par aadhaarit he or sati or johar aadi kuprathaen hamaare samaaj kaa hi hissaa rahi hai
 However, she says that there is no point in denouncing the disclaimer against the sati-johar system at the beginning of the film, as the glorification of Rajput aan-baan-shan goes on for three hours
 bataa den swara anaarakali of aara, tanu vaids manu, prem ratan dhan paao, nil bate sannata jaisi filmon se bollywood main apni alag pahchaan bana chuki hai
