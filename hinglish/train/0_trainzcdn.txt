 For nearly two weeks, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Hemant Biswa Sarma made an aerial trip to remote areas of the state and sought support from the people for the party in the panchayat elections
 in chunaavon ko bhi party ne kisi anya chunaav kii tarah hi puri gambhirtha se liya he

 yah vidheyak bhaajapa kii ek sajeesh he
 The people of Assam gave the BJP seven seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and a heavy mandate in the 2016 assembly elections
 uske badale bhaajapa ab assam ke logon ko dhokhaa de rahi he
 At the same time, the bjp's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) is contesting the panchayat elections alone
 vah bhi vidheyak ko lekar lagaataar hamalavar he or kai baar apana gathbandhan khatm karne kii dhamkee de chuki he
 BJP president Amit Shah was trying to take credit for updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) under the supervision of the Supreme Court to identify illegal Bangladeshi immigrants living in Assam, while the AGP ignored Assamese interests over Shah
 Accused of cheating people
 shah ne bayaan diya tha ki bangladesh se aae ghuspaithiyon ke mudde ko sulajhane ke liye centre sarkaar or chah saal tak chale assam andolan ke netaaon ke bich 1985 main jo assam samjhauta hua, enarasi uski 'aatma' thi
 Reacting to this, AGP President and Cabinet Minister Atul Bora said, "amit Shah considered NRC the soul of the Assam Accord, i thank him for this but to save this soul, the Modi government has four spirits - The Citizenship (amendment) Bill, 2016; Passport (entry into India) Amendment Rules, 2015; Foreigners (amendment) Order, 2015 and long-term visas for the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh have to be discontinued immediately
 naagarikta kanoonon or passport niyamon main sanshodhan ke jariye pichley daravaaje se avaidh apravasiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta pradaan karne kii centre sarkaar kii koi bhi koshish, enarasi ko apadet karne ke mul abhipraay ko khatm kar degi
 The Sonowal government is also more troubled because the ordinance is helping the Paresh Barua-led faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) regain its roots
 media reporton ke mutabik, pichley chah maheenon main ek software ejeeniyar, ek rajya stareey athlete or eeesau ke jila str ke netaa samet assam ke kam se kam 50 yuva, ulpha main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Many of them claimed on social media that the state government was putting Assam's future at stake, so they took such a step to protect Assam's future from illegal immigrants
 vaise rajya ke police adhikari daawa karte hai ki media main ulpha main nai bhartiyon kii sankhya ko badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya gaya he
 "every year, some disgruntled youth and women join the ULFA," says a top officer of the Assam Police's Special Branch
 hamaare paas report he ki is saal 11 yuva ulpha main shaamil ho gaye jabaki 15 usase judye kii raah par the par vakt rahete hamane unhen pakad liya or unhen sahi rasta dikhaaya
 This year, a different trend is being seen that social media and traditional media are presenting it in large numbers and it is being introduced with outrage against the bill
 ''ulpha main shaamil hone vaale nae log hathiyaaron ke saath apni tasviren or video soshal media par aplod karke sansanikhej tareeke se apane mansoobon kaa elaan kar rahe hai, jo ki ek nayaa chalan he
 ULFA chief Barua has threatened that he will carry out terrorist activities against the bill
 vaise ulpha ne 1 november ko tinsukiya ke paas agyaat bandookdhaariyon ke haathon paanch banglabhashi hindu kisaanon kii goli markar hatya kii ghatana kii jimmedaari lene se inkaar kar diya
 Since July this year, three low-intensity bombings have also taken place in various parts of Assam
 vipakshi dalon ne bigadati kanoon vyavastha ke liye bhaajapa sarkaar ko doshi tehraaya he
 Debbrata Saikia, leader of the Congress Legislature Party, says, "the bjp-led government and the Center in the state are moving ahead with the Citizenship (amendment) Bill, ignoring the sentiments of the Assamese people
" isse assam ke yuva niraash hai or pratikriyaswaroop ulpha main shaamil ho rahe hai
 "there is widespread fear in Assam that if the proposed bill comes into force, many illegal Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh will get citizenship of India, and there is a lot of opposition in the Assamese-dominated Brahmaputra Valley in the same fear
" iske alaava meghalaya or mizoram kii sarkaron ne bhi vidheyak kaa joardaar virodh kiya he or iske khilaaf prastaav paarit kiye hai
 The BJP is pursuing a strategy to protect the Hindu identity of Assam by preparing a cut of illegal Muslims from Bangladesh through this bill
 par asamiya logon ko lagata he ki hindu bengaaliyon ke kaaran unki saanskrithik viraasat khatre main pad sakati he
 The government has failed to overcome their fear
 assam main banglabhashiyon kii sankhya main lagaataar vruddhi ho rahi he or isse asamiya logon kaa andeh gaharaaya he
 The region has a long history of socio-cultural rivalry between Assamese and Bengali communities
 1991 se 2011 ke bich, asamiya bhashiyon kii sankchaya 58 fisadi se ghatakar 48 pratishat ho gai jabaki banglabhashiyon kii sankhya 22 fisadi se badhkar 29 fisadi ho gai
 In the Barak Valley of Assam dominated by Hindu Bengalis, Assamese is still not accepted as the official language
 asamiya up-rashtrawaad ke nayak (or ek dein) sonoval ke liye yah pariksha kii sabase kathin ghadi hogiah bhaajapa or aresas netritv is bill ko bina der kiye paarit karana chahta he, unke dabaav ke bich unhen asamiya matadaataaon ke man main upji asuraksha kii bhaavana ko bhi dur karnaa hoga
 Sonowal has kept silence about the bill for the time being but sources reveal that he has expressed his apprehension in front of the top leadership
 vahiin, sarama vidheyak ke sabase mukhar samarthakon main hai
 Sarma says, "there is no opposition to the bill in Assam
 sirf kuch swaghoshit buddhijivi or media kaa ek varg isko lekar hai-tauba machaa rahaa he
 The AGP has no right to talk about illegal immigrants
 assam samjhaute par dastakhat unke netaaon ne kiye the
 The same agreement provided that by 1971, all illegal immigrants from Bangladesh were accepted as citizens of India
 agar unhen assam ke logon kii vaaki chintaa thi to unhen 1971 nahin balki 1951 tak bangladesh se aae logon ko pradesh kaa naagarik maanane kii maang kerani chahie thi
 The same system has been adopted in the rest of the states of the country
 ''sataae gaye hinduon ko naagarikta dene kaa mudda 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bhaajapa kaa ek ahm chunavi vaada tha
 Also, the large Hindu Bengali population of Barak Valley supports the bill and the BJP does not want to lose its loyal vote bank in the entire state
 agar party bill ko paarit karaane main vifal rahati he to pashchim bengal main loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bhaajapa kii sambhaavnaaon par pratikul asar ho saktaa he, jahaan vah hindu aabaadi or hindu hiton ke sangrakshak ke rup main khud ko pesh kar rahi he
 The central leadership of the BJP hopes that by implementing clause 6 of the Assam Accord, it will address the concerns of the Assamese people
 yah khand asamiya logon kii saanskrithik, saamaajik, bhashaayi pahchaan or viraasat kii raksha, sangrakshan or prachaar ke liye sanvaidhanik, vidhaayi or prashasnic suraksha pradaan karata he
 bjp's National Secretary Ram Madhav says, "as far as the linguistic and cultural identity of Assam is concerned, we will ensure the written defense by implementing clause 6
" ''assam main philhal aise siyaasi vaadon par yakeen karne waalon kii sankhya kam hi hogi kyonki samjhaute ke ek or mahatvapurn ang enarasi ko apadet karne main rajnatik dalon ne kareeb do dashakon kaa samay laga diya or isamen supreme court ko hastkshep karnaa padaa
 People are skeptical about the BJP which is challenging Article 35A in Kashmir, will implement clause 6
 assam main vidheyak ke khilaaf baari virodh ke baad, iske praavdhaanon kii jaanch ke liye ek sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) gathit kii gai
 The JPC, which has already been given six extensions, has so far failed to establish any consensus
 samiti main shaamil bhaajapa ke sadsy jahaan bill ko lagu karne kii baat kar rahe hai, vahiin vipakshi sadasyon kaa tark he ki avaidh apravasiyon chaahe vah hindu hi kyon na hon, ko naagarikta nahin di jaani chahie kyonki dharm naagarikta sambandhit nirnay lene kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 As such, this bill is unlikely to be passed in the winter session of Parliament, as the BJP does not have a substantial majority in the Rajya Sabha
 baharhaal, panchayat chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan, tay kar saktaa he ki vidheyak ko lekar party kya rukh apnayegi
 If the BJP performs well, then Sarma's stand will prove to be right and the central leadership may try to move the bill faster
 haalanki, guwahati vishvavidhyalay main professor nani gopal mahanta kehete hai, ''vidheyak par ab saarvajanik rup se charchaa ho rahi he or panchayat chunaavon par iskaa zyada asar padane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 If the BJP ignores the opposition and takes a more aggressive approach towards it, then its performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections could be adversely affected
 ''iske alaava, agar bhaajapa or agypi aam chunaav main alag-alag chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla karte hai, to isse bhaajapa ke vot bank main send lagegi
 In the 2016 assembly elections, there was a coalition of BJP-AGP-BPF (bodoland People's Front) which helped in unifying the Assamese, tribal and Hindu votes of the three sides of the state
 us pradarshan ko dohraane ke liye, donon pakshon ko aapasi sulah banane ke liye kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 Says a BJP leader, "at the moment, it is so tedious that even in the meetings of the cabinet, there is hardly any interaction between AGP and BJP leaders
 '' jitna jald ho sake, unhen baatcheet shuru kar deni chahie
 The Issuing Citizenship (amendment) Bill, 2016 seeks amendment to the Citizenship Bill, 1955
 yah vidheyak aise gaiyrkanoonee ghuspaithiyon ko, jo afghanistan, bangladesh yaa pakistan se bharat main daakhil hue hindu, sikh, buddha, jaini, parsi yaa isai hai, bharat kii naagarikta ke yogya banaata he
 This amendment was apparently inspired by reports that said many Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals from these minority communities have been forced to seek refuge in India due to religious persecution or fear and apprehension
 
 naagarikta kanoon,1955avaidh pravaasiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta hasil karne se roktaa he
 An illegal migrant is a foreigner who enters the country without valid travel documents like passport and visa or comes with valid documents but stays here longer than the number of days he has been allowed to stay
 avaidh pravaasiyon ko videshi kanoon, 1946 or passport (bharat main pravesh) kanoon 1920 ke tahat jail main daalaa ja saktaa he yaa unke desh waapas bheja ja saktaa he
 Both these laws give the Central Government the right to enforce rules and regulations on the arrival and departure of foreigners within India
 saal 2015 or 2016 main centre sarkaar ne videshi kanoon or passport (bharat main pravesh) kanoon se avaidh pravaasiyon ke kuch nishchit samoohon—afghanistan, bangladesh or pakistan se aane vaale hinduon, sikhon, baudhon, jainiyon, parsiyon or isaayiyon—ko chhot dene ke liye do adhisuchanaaen jari kii hai
 This means that illegal migrants from these groups will neither be jailed nor evicted from India for staying in India without valid documentation
 naagarikta kanoon ke tahat kisi videshi ko bharat kii naagarikta hasil karne kii jaruraton main se ek yah he ki aavedak pichley 12 maheene or pichley 14 main se 11 saal bharat main jarur rahaa ho
 The current bill reduces this 11-year requirement to six years for the people of the same six religions and three countries
 kendriya grih mantralay ne pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh ke alpsankhyak logon ke liye lambey vakt kaa vija (altivi) manjuur karne kii prakriya ko bhi udaar bana diya he or unhen desh main jameen-jaaydaad kharidne, bank khaataa kholane or pan (sthaayee khaataa sankhya) tathaa aadhaar card hasil karne kii ijaajat de di he
 Critics of the bill say that it violates Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing the right to equality, as the bill qualifies illegal migrants to be citizenship on the basis of religion

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is on a fast-track tour to win the party in the Lok Sabha elections and is attacking the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 haalanki is dauraan wo apane parivaar par hamalaa karne se bachati najar aa rahi hai
 On Wednesday, when Priyanka Gandhi was asked about Maneka Gandhi, she deftly avoided it
 menka gandhi bhartiya janata party kii netaa hai or modi sarkaar main kendriya mantri hai
 She seems to be Priyanka Gandhi's aunt
 darasal, purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi wadra buudhvaar ko amethi pahunchin or party ke kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet kii
 During this, Priyanka Gandhi also met the media and answered many questions
 patrakaron se baatcheet ke dauraan priyanka gandhi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath, kendriya vittamantri arun jetali samet bhartiya janata party par jamkar hamalaa bolaa, lekin menka gandhi ke sawaal ko behad chaalaaki se taal gayi
 When Priyanka Gandhi was asked for feedback on Maneka Gandhi's statement, in which she said that Priyanka's arrival in UP will not have any effect, because the Congress feet are not on the ground
 unako pataa hi nahin he ki jameen par kya ho rahaa he, to priyanka ne gandhi wadra is sawaal ko behad chaalaaki se taal gayi
 He said that if Maneka Gandhi is saying something like this, then this is her view
 vahiin, jab priyanka se yogi ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya, to unhone fouran palatwaar kiya
 He was asked to react to the statement made by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in which Yogi said that Priyanka Gandhi only remembers temples in the election, then Priyanka Gandhi retaliated by this
 unhone kaha, 'siem yogi ko kya pataa ki main mandir jaati hum yaa nahin jaati hum
 Or do i just go to the temple during elections or not? What does she know about me? 'during this time when Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was asked if she would contest the Lok Sabha elections this time, she said that if her party wants, she will definitely contest the election, but no plan about it yet
 Is made amethi main congress kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet ke dauraan unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main rahul gandhi kii jeet nahin hogi, balki desh kii jeet hogi
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that this time Rahul Gandhi will not only become an MP, but will also become the Prime Minister of the country
 agar 1977 or 1998 ko chhod diya jaae, to amethi loksabhaa seat par congress kaa hi kabja rahaa he
 At present, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is an MP from this seat
 ‘rab ne bana di jodi’ main pados kii ladki se lekar ‘badmaash company’ main glamras model jaisi dikhti anoushka sharma nahin chaahati ki unhen kisi ek bhoomika main baandh kar dekha jaae or aisi bhoomikaayen nibhaana chaahatin hai jisase koi bhi ladki khud ko jod sake
 Anushka said, 'I take any film when i like her story or her role
 main khud ko kisi ek bhoomika main nahin baandhna chaahati or na hi yah chaahati hum ki kisi ek bhoomika vishesh ke liye sabko main yaad aauun
 'she said,' i want to play a role that other girls can attach themselves to
 ’anoushka pichley dinon apni nai film ‘band baaja baraat’ ke prachaar ke silsile main navdith kalakaar ranvir ke saath dilli main thim
 Anushka's film is scheduled to release on December 10
 bollywood main aane ke pehle aath saal fishan kii duniya main bitaane vaali anoushka ne kaha, ‘ramp par chalane se lekar filmon main aane tak kaa safar mjedaar rahaa, lekin eemaandaaree se kahuun, to glamer kii duniya mujhe bahut zyada acchhee nahin lagati
 ' aaj ek insaan nahin ek kaum kaa janmdin he
 Sanjay Kapoor, a divine man bloomed on this earth 48 years ago
 kya kaha, koun sanjay kapur
 
 
 Hey your mustache version of Anil Kapoor
 acha ab aap soch rahe honge ham in janaab kii baat kyon kar rahe hai jinaki bollywood main paidaaish bhi kisi ko yaad nahin
 Actually you are making a mistake here
 sanjay kapur ko footage naa dekar hamane ek mahaan panrapara ke dhwajvahak ke saath anyaay kiya he
 Sanjay Kapoor is the biggest poster boy of brotherhood in Bollywood
 bhaichara maane bhai ke saath chaare (kharchaa-pani) kaa pavitra rishta rakhana
 Know your Udaya Baba, Sohail Mian, Arbaaz Bhai and so on
 in tamaam logon kii vajah se bharat main parivaar kii sanstha jinda he
 Love among the brothers is alive
 baahar ke deshon main jahaan balig hone par maa-baap bacchon ko ghar se nikaal dete hai ki betaa jaao, ab khud kamao
 We will not raise you
 vahiin apane desh main bada bhai chote bhai ko taumr paalataa he
 Salman Bhai is raising two of his younger Mustande brothers
 ekta kapur, tushaar baba ko paal rahi hai
 Udaya Baba is being blessed by Aditya Pal, the revered husband of Rani Mukerji
 umr bhar bhai se kharchaa ugaahne ke liye bade samarpan kii jarurat he
 You have to skillfully do nothing with full force
 or darjanon kute galatiyon se guzarana padataa he
 If not sure, then open eyes and remember Uday Chopra's cute smile and that announcement
 acting quits me finali
 Oh God
 kisi pakizgi bhari sweekaarokti thi vah
 Aditya's eyes came out of tears
 khayr, baaten hai baton kaa kya
 Let us know about your birthday boy
 inaki traasadee pehali film se hi shuru hoti he
 Bhai's debut film Prem was a total of five years late
 shaayad isiilie usamen ek gaanaa bhi pehle hi daal diya gaya tha
 'don't come don't come 
 
 saamne he par najar aati nahin
 It is another matter that a few years later it became famous as a constipation song
 or film, vah to flop honi thi so hui
 The only hit film in Sanjay's career came with Bollywood's Madhuri Dixit
 lekin sanjay ke saath majaak yahaan bhi badastoor jari rahaa
 The name of the film was 'raja' but Madhuri took the credit
 masakhron ne to ye bhi kaha film kaa naam rani rakh dete
 Well, after this, the brothers disappeared from the movies as horns would disappear from the donkey's head
 ye honge, isliye kyonki hamane gadhe ke sing abhi tak dekhe nahin
 So how could they see his disappearance
 par muhaavara he to nibhaana hi hoga
 Like low-back King Jugal Hansraj, Sanjay also tried to comeback several times, but every time the audience heard the decree of 'go Back'
 aakhri haadasa hua tha inaki film qayaamat se
 Where the two precious singles of the brotherhood were Sanjay Kapoor and Arbaaz Khan together
 qayaamat ke din jo ajaab aaenge unase bhi kahin zyada dardanaak thi ye film
 For public interest, this film was taken off the screen as soon as possible
 tab jaakar mulk kaa lau and order bachaa or jaan-maal kii raksha kii ja saki
 
 ab bhai ne sochaa self rispect bhi to koi cheez he
 So, he went to the eldest brother's shelter and got rid of the producer ho films
 itihaas gavaah he hajaaron logon ne is kadam par nihaal hokar inhen maanav seva kaa nobel die jane kii sifarish kar di
 In the end, it is so much that you are not a human being but a complete community
 duniya bhar main bhale parivaar tuutate ja rahe hon lekin bharat main bhaiwad bachaane main aapkaa bahut bada yogadan he
 Celebrate this day as Brotherhood Day and make the information of the brothers reach everyone
 haalanki kaam kathin he
 Because when you go to Wikipedia to gather information about this brother, Fucking Mara says' This page is some issue
 ' are bina ishyu ke bhi koi mahaan ban sakaa he
 Finally a lion's pulp, your gaze
 
 
 koi yun hi sanjay kapur nahin hotakuch na kuch to bhasad rahi hogi

 use jo acha lagata he wo karata he
 Whether it is against the society, against the law or against the whole of humanity
 tabhi to use duniya taanashaah kahati he
 But the dictatorship of this dictator that you have seen so far
 wo to kuch bhi nahin
 What we are telling you is going to cross all limits of cruelty
 or wo he kim jong un ke torchar room
 Where a man goes, he is alive, but returns as a corpse
 taarikh ke panne uthaakar unhen palatnaa shuru kiijie or dhundie us insaan ko jise duniya kaa sabase krur, sabase beraham or sabase bedard insaan kaha ja sake
 Surely, some names may have started coming in your mind, Adolf Hitler's name may have come in the mind of some
 jisane yatnaa camp main lakhon yahudiyon ko tadapaa tadapaa kar maar daalaa
 Some may have taunted Abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 jiske maut dene ke tareeke se khud yamraj bhi panaah maangate hai
 Or some might be thinking of Saddam Hussein
 jinhone chemical atake kar hazaron logon ko ek jatke main maut kii neend sula diya
 Or some might be thinking of Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, Idi Amin Genghis Khan and Mao Zedang
 krurta kaa he devtaa kim jong unamgar jab aap kim jong un ke naam tak pahunch jaaen to apane zahan kii kasarat ko roak dijie
 Because now you have reached that person
 jisaki krurta kaa taarikh main na to koi sani hua
 Neither is nor probably ever will be
 aapako puraa haq he ki aap hairaan ho jaaen
 We too were, but not until we were confronted with that truth
 jise is taanashaah ne duniya ke saamne aane nahin diya
 The truth is that neither Hitler, Baghdadi, nor Saddam nor Idi Amin reach close to it in terms of ruthlessness
 torchar room main har roj marate hai logis taanashaah ke torchar room ke bare main ek peedit bataata he ki aap vahaan akele rahakar sirf maut kaa intazaar kar sakate hai
 Every night, even after the lights were extinguished, screams were heard from every room
 kyonki har raat koi na koi vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish karata tha
 And when caught, they are stripped and beaten very brutally overnight
 sabase dardanaak to ye he ki har rose vahaan log beraham maut mar rahe hai or duniya ko iskaa pataa tak nahin he
 If your heart is weak, we will request you not to read this report and not see it
 wo isliye ki jaise jaise aap aage badhate jaaengen
 Your faith will rise in humility
 kyonki ye kahani north korea ke aise taanashaah ki he jisane apni krurta se mulk kii jelon or yatnaa campon main sirf kaidiyon ke jismon ko hi nahin balki ruhon ko bhi zakhmi kar diya he
 And today this story will reveal the same wounds and the truth of Kim Jong Un
 ek mahila ne bataai khaufnak sacchaiek bhuktabhogi mahila bataati he ki wo duniya se kahana chaahati hum ki bhagwaan ke liye un logon ko bachaa lijie jo un torchar campon main fanse hue hai
 Because she has escaped from there
 usne wo dard jhela he
 Prisoners are locked in a cell where they can neither sit
 na let sakate hai or na khadey hi ho sakate hai
 They were like dogs' cages
 or unhen vahaan vaise hi rahanaa padataa tha
 He used to eat in it
 usee main shouch karte the
 This story is not one or two people but hundreds of people who managed to escape from North Korea's jails or torture camps
 unhone kim jong un ke zulmon sitam kii kahani bayaan kii he
 But no one other than a woman named Rot could dare to show face
 kaidiyon ko miltaa he sada hua khanajelon or campon main itnaa zulm hota he ki log bhaagane kii koshish karte hai
 And they shoot them without thinking
 or baaki candiyon ko uski laashen dikhaakar dhamkee di jaati he ki unka bhi yahi haal hoga
 In the name of food, the prisoners get a bowl of rice just once a day
 usamen bhi itnaa pani mila diya jaataa he ki wo chaaval se dalia ban jaataa he or usamen se sadan kii badboo aati he
 The Korean torture camp that is ruthless without hearing is like that person on this earth
 jahaan insaaniyat naam kii koi chiz hi nahin he
 Prisoners are made to work like machines for 18-18 hours a day
 or kaam se inkaar karnaa yahaan apni dardanaak maut ko daavat dene jaisaa he
 They get what they get in the name of food and they die of weakness in a few days
 or jo nahin khate wo bhukh se mar jate hai
 The example of brutal methods used here to torture prisoners is found nowhere in the present world nor in history
 kisi bhi niyam ko todane par yahaan bina kisi sunwaayee ke ek hi sazaa milti he
 And that is death
 duniya ke saamne ai aisi krurataye pehla mauka he jab duniya ke saamne north korea ke sanakee taanashaah kii krurta kii hakeekat saamne aa rahi he
 But the full torture of torture in Kim Jong Un's torture room is yet to be revealed
 media par pabandi lagaakar kaise ye taanashaah apane kaidiyon par kahar dhaha rahaa he
 We are telling you its inside story
 or ye insaide story kim jong un ke maut ke shivi main bataur guard tainaat rahe lim kii ankhon dekhi he
 He tells that after tying his hands back, he used to hold his hair and hit his face on the walls and table
 wo insaan nahin haivaan hai
 How can a human do this to another human being
 us jagah ke bare main bataane ke liye uske paas shabd nahin he
 There the torture starts with the sun rising and continues till the sun sets
 mahila kaidiyon ke saath hota replim ke mutabik purush sicurity guard mahila kaidiyon kaa rape karte hai
 He has witnessed the rape and murder of thousands of prisoners before his eyes
 itnaa hi nahin unhen zindaa jala diya jaataa he
 Women prisoners are forced to abort while pregnant
 wo garbhvatee mahilaon ke pet par laat maarthe hai
 Even then, if children were born, they are buried alive
 lim kahati hai ki abhi bhi ye yakeen kar paanaa mushkil he ki vah zindaa he
 Humans cannot live where he was kept
 wo maut kaa cameraa tha
 Lim is the one who had good luck and who somehow managed to escape from North Korea's death camps
 ye unheen kii aap beeti he
 But amidst these stories of pain, listen to the voice that has seen all this happening in front of your eyes
 lim ne kiya he khaufnak khulhasalim haai-jin vahi mahila guard he, jisane north korea ke is taanashaah kii hakeekat duniya ke saamne laakar use benakaab kar diya he
 In the torture camps with women, this vandalism was taking place
 vahaan lim maujuud thi
 He has seen everything with his eyes
 usne dekha he ki kaise uski saathi purush guard mahila kaidiyon ke saath jaanwaron kii tarah badasluki kar rahe the
 She has seen how women prisoners were abducted in a very brutal manner while pregnant
 lim haai-jin ke is khulaase se puri duniya sakate main he
 Lim, who fled South Korea to South Korea, made this disclosure in an interview to an English newspaper
 lim ne bataaya ki kaise yatnaa shiviron main kaidiyon ko maamuli baat par jaan se maar diya jaataa he
 Women are burnt alive on opposing rape

 The comments tippaniyan Militants seized 10 kg explosive TNT from the possession of a major attack
 ULFA-I militants in Tinsukia of Assam, military forces thwarted a major terror attack on Tuesday
 ek sainya oparation main pratibandhit ugravadi sanghathan united libration front of assam (ulpha) ke hardkor ugravadi ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 a 10 kg explosive was destroyed by his capture
 isi ke saath sainya balon ne ek bade aatanki hamale kii yojana ko vifal kar diya he
 After successful information was received, the Sena and Tinsukia Police started intensive checking of vehicles at Chikrajan
 check points par kaimobilegadiyaan tainaat kii gayi
 During this time the military forces were successful and a joint team of army and police arrested Swayambhu Sergeant Sabdo Asom alias Jonki Bora
 is oparation main sanyukt team ne kaaphi maatra main visphotak, hathiyaar, datonator or remote control baraamad kiye
 Explosives are being told that this is a very dangerous and deadly chemical TAT
 isaki maatra 10 kilo bataai ja rahi he
 In the face of the major attack, a top officer of the militant army told India Today that ULFA-I had been getting some major attack intelligence input in the state for a long time
 input main kaha gaya tha ki ulpha aatanki upree assam main sena par bada hamalaa karne kii firaaq main hai taaki phir se ve apana dabadabaa jataa saken
 However, due to the arrest of ULFA militant Bora, the nefarious plans of the terrorists failed and with that the army deferred a major attack
 sena kaa abhiyaan jaribhartiya sena upree assam main kai dinon se ulpha-ai ke khilaaf morcha khole hue he
 The recovery of such a large amount of weapons and explosives and the arrest of hardcore militants are said to be helpful in breaking the back
 sainya oparationane ugravadiyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he jisase sthaneey logon ko kaaphi raahat mil rahi he
 The Captain, by whose name the film world trembled, is now lodged in prison bars
 abu salem ne dehshat ke dam par jo aaleeshaan jindagi ko jiya he, waisi life kam hi mafiaon ko naseeb hui he
 Know some such things about the life of Abu Salem, who sees himself like diamonds in the mirror, is very frightening and interesting
 1
 Salem's first victim: Abu Salem's first victim was Mumbai-based builder Pradeep Jain
 pradeep ke bhai se salem ne coldongri kii property chhodane yaa jaan se haath dhone kii dhamkee di
 Pradeep found it costly not to take Salem's threat seriously
 7 march 1995 ko salem ke shooter saleem haddi ne pradeep jain ke daftar main ghuskar goli maar di
 But the story does not end here
 pradeep kii terahavin vaale din salem pradeep kii patni jyoti ko phone kar kahata he, 'kya tumhen vidhwaa hone kaa sukh mil rahaa he
 If Pradeep had given the money, he would have been alive
 pradeep ke bhaaiyon se kaho, paise den, varanaa sabko maar duungaa
 '2
 sangeet samraat kii hatya:abu salem ne jis tarah se gulshan kumaar kii hatya karwaai thi
 When Salem asked Gulshan Kumar to give 5 lakh rupees every month, Gulshan Kumar denied that by giving so much money, he would make a bhandara in Vaishno Devi
 gussaye salem ne jald hi behad hi khaufnak tareeke se shooter raja ke jariye gulshan kaa din dahaade murder karvaa diya
 It is said that the shooter Raja kept his phone on for about 10 to 15 minutes during the murder of Gulshan Kumar so that Gulshan Kumar could hear the screams of Abu Salem
 is hatyakand main kathith taur par sangeetkaar nadeem bhi shaamil the
 3
 salem kaa sanjay dutt se 'yaarana':saal 1992 khatm hote hote desh main badhate sampradayik dange hone lage the
 Sunil Dutt's family helped the people irrespective of the religion of the injured
 lekin jab ek ugr bheed ne sunil dutt kii car par hamalaa kiya to sanjay ko parivaar kii chintaa sataane lagi
 To solve this problem, Sanjay sought help from producers named Hanif Kadawala and Sameer Hingora
 anis ibrahim se is babat sampark karne ke baad ye tay hua ki abu salem, kadawala ke or hingola ke saath sanjay ke ghar bandooken or hathgole lekar jayega
 Salem used to consider Sanjay Dutt as his role model
 ye sanjay se salem kii pehali mulaakaat honi thi
 Salem wiped his palm in a sweat-soaked pants before joining hands with Sanjay, when Sanjay himself went ahead and hugged Salem
 bataaya jaataa he ki salem sanjay se milakar is kadar khush tha ki kai dinon tak chahakta rahaa tha

 'captain bol rahaa hum
 
 
 '- Salem was proved successful in Bollywood after the murder of Gulshan Kumar
 iske baad salem ne filmi hastiyon ko phone karte vakt captain naam bataanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Salem chose this code because of the Mumbai Police's phone tapping
 iske alaava salem bollywood ke logon se archelan naam se bhi miltaa tha
 Salem was also living the life of a fictional person by the name of Arsalan, who he described as an assistant of Salem
 5
 Mehbooba of Salem: After being born in Punjab, Monica Bedi studied English literature from Oxford University, UK
 iske baad mumbai main monica dance seekhney lageen
 After gradually increasing interest in films, Monica got Mukesh Duggal's film 'suraksha'
 duggal ko salem se nazdikiyon ke liye janaa jaataa tha
 Salem and Monica meet at a Bollywood party in Dubai
 us party se shuru hua rishta kai deshon or jelon main salem ke saath sajaa kaatane ke baad 4 july 2007 ko aakar thama
 On this date, Monica was released in India 5 years after her arrest with Salem in Lisbon
 salem ab bhi jail main band he or monica apane filmi-tivi kariyar par dhyaan de rahi hai
 (these stories from Abu Salem are taken from S

 com / n3f3td9wor kya aapane kabhi suna he ki jis janata se samvaad or janata kii samasyaon ko sunne ke liye pradesh kaa mukhyamantri janata darbar lagaae usee janata darbar main mukhyamantri or janata ke bich main ek pardaa laga diya jaae
 It sounds strange, but something similar has happened in Karnam, Haryana
 pradesh ke mukhyamantrimanohar laal khattarajanata kii samasyaon ko sunne or unka samaadhaan karne ke liye aalaa adhikariyon kii fouj ke saath janata darbar main baithe to jarur, lekin is dauraan janata or mukhyamantri ke bich main ek safed rang kaa tentnuma pardaa laga diya gaya
 There was definitely a dialogue between the Chief Minister and the public, but during this time, people kept telling their problems only on the mike and the CM also instructed the officers from behind the scenes to solve the problems of the public
 haalanki is janata darbar ke dauraan siem or janata ke bich main pardaa kyon lagaaya gaya is sawaal par karnal ke puure prashasan ne chuppi sadhi hui he
 Even when an attempt was made to talk to several ministers of the government on this issue, they also refused to say anything, accusing the media of unnecessarily blaming the matter
 haalanki karnal kii meyar renu bala gupta is maamle par saamne ain or unhone kaha ki kai baar suraksha or anya kaarnon se sthaneey prashasan or police ko siem ke janata darbar ke dauraan kai tarah ke intjaam karne hote hai
 This entire matter should not be unnecessarily blown out and there may be several security reasons behind the curtain
 vahiin is puure maamle par party se naaraaz chal rahe kurukshetra ke saansad rajkumaar saini ne kaha ki ab haryana main BJP kii sarkaar ko 4 saal se zyada kaa vakt ho chukaa he or ab pardaa lagane kaa nahin balki ab pardaa uthne kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 In such a situation, the Khattar government will not get any benefit by putting such curtains
 haryana kii mukhya vipakshi party indian neshnal lokdal ne bhi sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki mukhyamantri kis vajah se janata se sidhaa samvaad nahin karnaa chaahate ye unhen bataanaa chahie
 Indian National Lok Dal spokesperson Praveen Atre said that in fact, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has no answer for not fulfilling the promises made to the public during the assembly election campaign, so to avoid the public in this way Talk is being done and curtain is being put between the public and the CM
 ye puraa vivaad ye sawaal jarur khadaa karata he jis janata kii samasyaon ko sunne ke liye janata darbar lagaaya ja rahaa he to usee janata or siem ke bich main pardaa lagane ke peeche aakhirkaar kya matlab he
 If security is the reason, during cm's Janata Durbar, not only the police of the district but also the heavy police force of CM Security also resides around the CM
 isiilie pardaa lagane ke lagane ke peeche suraksha kii vajah kisi ke gale nahin utar rahi

 In the first episode of 'bigg Boss' in the new year, Salman Khan told the family that they should start the year with positivity, for this he told Swami om-gaurav Chopra and Bani j-lopamudra that they would praise each other 
 swami om is maukey par bhi khud ko bada bataane kii koshish karte rahe vahiin gaurav ne kaha ki jab swami om muskuraate hai to vah bacchon jaise lagate hai jo ki unki khaasiyat he
 At the same time Lopamudra said about Bani that she is very disciplined about herself and exercises, does everything on time
 vahiin bani ne lopa ke bare main kaha ki vah kaaphi kering hai or aage aakar sabaki madad karti hai
 She is always standing up for her friends
 bani ke jawaab par salmaan khan ne tali bhi bajaai
 After this, Salman Khan asked the family members who were his eyes, who would not go in the top 5, but when most people including Manu Manveer named Nitibha, she started crying
 is par unhone kaha ki unhen kharaab lag rahaa he ki jin logon ke saath vah apana puraa vakt bitaati hai unhen hi un par confidence nahin he
 Talking about the 'gaurav-bani Show' for the luxury budget, Salman Khan gave Gaurav Chopra and Bani j a chance to ask the family a question
 is par gaurav ne manavir se poocha ki task ke dauraan vah unase kya ummid kar rahe the jo unhen unke jawaab se niraashaa hui? is par manavir ne kaha ki vah kaaphi sulajhe hue hai or hameshaa sahi kaa saath dete hai, isliye unhen laga tha ki task ke dauraan ve kuch aisa kahenge jisase lagegaa ki vah ghar main hue priyanka or lopa kii ladaai ko lekar chintit the
 Later Salman Khan spoke on the Igloo task for the Captaincy
 swami om ne kaha ki task ke dauraan unki jaan ko khatra tha
 Salman Khan reprimanded Swami Om for removing clothes during the task
 manu punjabi ne jab aakhri tufaan ke dauraan swami om dwaara rohan mehara ko khinchne kii koshish ke bare main baat kii to swami om ne kaha ki unhen rohan ko nikaalnaa hota to unhen unki itani kamajoriyaan pataa hai ki unhen bataakar baahar nikaal dete
 When Salman asked him a mistake, he could not tell
 rohan ne kaha ki din main unki kai baaten ve ignor karte hai
 But during the storm task, Swami Om pulled him due to which he was badly hurt and then he got angry when he disturbed again during the Flower Bed task the next day
 salmaan khan ne rohan ko samajhaayaa ki vah samajhate hai ki swami om kii harkaton kii vajah unki sahanshakti ne jawaab de di, lekin sabakuch shant hone ke baad rohan ne swami om ko jaakar dhakka diya jo ki galat tha
 He then asked Lopa questions to support Rohan without seeing the incident and to make the 'bigg Boss' decision wrong, that he was not supposed to do it without knowing anything
 unhone kaha ki unhen baad main samajhaana chahie tha ki unhone galat kiya
 Salman Khan told Lopa that when Rohan was sitting in the bathroom, Lopa was of course standing with him but she did not look good as she was mouthing and laughing
 unhone kaha ki aisa lag rahaa tha ki vah rohan ko nicha dikhaa rahi hai
 Salman explained to Rohan that his image is in his hand and that he should control himself
 iske baad salmaan khan ne swami om ko fatkaar lagaai ki flower bed task main jab unka naam nahin tha, jab rule main likhaa tha ki rohan or manavir hi task karenge
 So why did he go inside? Salman said that Swami Om is very vicious, he feels that negative publicity is also publicity
 salmaan ne kaha ki jitna vah swami om se baat karenge, vah tivi par utane hi zyada dikhaai denge
 Salman said that from now on he will not talk to Swami Om at all
 iske baad tivi abhinayta aamir ali or 'big bos' kii purv pratibhaagi diandra sores guest panel main shaamil hue
 Both said that they like Manveer and Lopa
 donon ne gaurav or bani kii dosti or gharavaalon ke game plan ke bare main baat kii
 Diandra said that Gaurav's effort is seen more in the friendship between Gaurav and Bani, Aamir said that Gaurav's effort is also seen more because he is single
 aamir ne rohan ke bare main kaha ki unhen 'big bos' ke faisle par sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie tha
 The comments iske baad ek api fiz collar ne nitibha se sawaal kiya ki gaurav-bani task ke dauraan jis tarah unhone gaurav ko chappal dikhaai kya unhen realyse nahin hua ki usase unki khud kii image kharaab ho sakati he
 At this, Nitibha apologized that she could not make a right decision on that moment, saying that she had gone in a funny tone though it is her fault and for this she apologized to Gaurav
 iske baad 'big bos' ne gharavaalon se kaha ki ve ghar se beghar hone kii prakriya ko puraa karenge
 Under this, one of the three members will be out of the house
 sabase pehle 'big bos' ne monalisa ko surakshit ghoshit kiya
 He then called Gaurav and Bani to the activity area and showed a video of the special moments of their friendship to both them and the family members and said that this is the last day inside the house when they are together
 iske baad unhone donon ko bataaya ki gaurav ghar se baahar jaaenge
 Manu and Manveer, who were said to be his opponents after leaving Gaurav's house, also became emotional
 iske baad salmaan khan ne gharavaalon se poocha ki unki najar main koun hai jo top 5 main nahin jaaenge, is par jab manu manavir samet zyaadaatar logon ne nitibha kaa naam liya to vah rone lageen
 To this, she said that she feels bad that the people with whom she spends all her time do not have confidence in them
 lagjri bajet ke liye hue 'gaurav-bani sho' par baat karte hue salmaan khan ne gaurav chopra or bani je ko mauka diya ki ve gharavaalon se koi ek sawaal puch sakate hai
 On this Gaurav asked Manveer what he was expecting from him during the task which disappointed him with his answer? To this, Manveer said that he is very settled and always supports the right, so he thought that during the task he would say something that would make him feel that he was worried about Priyanka and Lopa's fight in the house
 baad main salmaan khan ne captency ke liye hue iglu task par baat kii
 Swami Om said that his life was in danger during the task
 task ke dauraan kapade utaarne par salmaan khan ne swami om ko fatkaar lagaai
 When Manu Punjabi talked about Swami Om's attempt to pull Rohan Mehra during the last storm, Swami Om said that if he had to get Rohan out, he knew his weaknesses and would have told him out
 jab salmaan ne unase ek galati puche to vah bataa nahin paae
 Rohan said that he ignores many of his things during the day
 lekin tufaan task ke dauraan swami om ne unhen khinchaa jisase unhen kaaphi chot ai thi or phir agle din flower bed task ke dauraan unhone dobaaraa disturb kiya to unhen gussa aa gaya
 Salman Khan explained to Rohan that he understands that Swami Om's antics were answered by his stamina, but after everything was calm Rohan pushed Swami Om to go which was wrong
 iske baad ghatana ko dekhe bina rohan kaa saport karne or 'big bos' ke faisle ko galat bataane ke liye unhone lopa se sawaal poocha ki bina kuch jane unhen aisa nahin karnaa tha
 He said that he should have explained later that he did wrong
 salmaan khan ne lopa se kaha ki jab rohan bathroom baithe the tab lopa beshak unke saath khadi thim lekin vah jaise munh bana rahi thim or jaise hans rahi thim vah acha nahin lag rahaa tha
 She said that it seemed that she was degrading Rohan
 salmaan ne rohan ko samajhaayaa ki apni image apane haath main he or unhen khud par kaabo rakhana chahie
 After this Salman Khan reprimanded Swami Om that when he was not named in the Flower Bed Task, when it was written in the rule that only Rohan and Manveer would do the task
 aise main vah andar kyon gaye? salmaan ne kaha ki swami om bahut shaatir hai, unhen lagata he ki negative publicity bhi publicity he
 Salman said that the more he talks to Swami Om, the more he will appear on TV
 salmaan ne kaha ki ab se vah swami om se bilkul bhi baat nahin karenge
 After this, TV actor Aamir Ali and former contestant of 'bigg Boss' Diandra Soares joined the guest panel
 donon ne kaha ki unhen manavir or lopa pasand hai
 The two talked about Gaurav and Bani's friendship and the game plan of the family
 diandra ne kaha ki gaurav or bani kii dosti main gaurav kaa efort zyada dikhataa he, aamir ne kaha ki gaurav kaa efort bhi shaayad isliye zyada dikhataa he kyonki vah akele hai
 Aamir said about Rohan that he should not have questioned the decision of 'bigg Boss'
 tippaniyan After this, an AP Fiz caller questioned Nitibha that the way he showed the slippers to Gaurav during the gaurav-bani task, did he not realize that it could spoil his own image
 is par nitibha ne maafee maangi ki shaayad us moment par sahi faisla nahin kar pai, unhone kaha ki vah ek mazaakia lahaze main gai thim haalanki yah unki galati he or iske liye unhone gaurav se maafee maangi
 After this, 'bigg Boss' told the family that they would complete the process of homelessness
 iske tahat teenon main se ek sadsy ghar se baahar ho jayega
 Firstly, 'bigg Boss' declared Monalisa safe
 iske baad unhone gaurav or bani ko activity aria main bulaayaa or unki dosti ke khaas palon kaa ek video un donon or gharavaalon ko dikhaaya or kaha ki ghar ke andar yah aakhri din he jab ve donon ek saath hai
 He then told both of them that Gaurav would go out of the house
 gaurav ke ghar se jane par unke virdohi kahe jane vaale manu or manavir bhi imotional ho gaye
 Talking about the 'gaurav-bani Show' for the luxury budget, Salman Khan gave Gaurav Chopra and Bani j a chance to ask the family a question
 is par gaurav ne manavir se poocha ki task ke dauraan vah unase kya ummid kar rahe the jo unhen unke jawaab se niraashaa hui? is par manavir ne kaha ki vah kaaphi sulajhe hue hai or hameshaa sahi kaa saath dete hai, isliye unhen laga tha ki task ke dauraan ve kuch aisa kahenge jisase lagegaa ki vah ghar main hue priyanka or lopa kii ladaai ko lekar chintit the

 He then asked Lopa questions to support Rohan without seeing the incident and to make the 'bigg Boss' decision wrong, that he was not supposed to do it without knowing anything
 unhone kaha ki unhen baad main samajhaana chahie tha ki unhone galat kiya
 Salman Khan told Lopa that when Rohan was sitting in the bathroom, Lopa was of course standing with him but she did not look good as she was mouthing and laughing

 maharashtra ke satara ilaake kaa farm house apane andar se ek or nithari ugal rahaa he
 Doctor Santosh Pol first brought his victims to the farm house
 phir uski marji se unhen drugs ke overdoj ke saath injection lagata
 There was such a medicine in that injection that the front would become insensible within just minutes of injecting
 uske andar hilne-dulne to chhodie apni ankhon kii palken khapkaane tak kii takat nahin bachati
 Then in such a condition he would pick them up and bury them directly in the pit
 kabuuli chah logon ko jinda dafnane kii batdoctorab tak chah logon ko injection kaa overdoj dekar jinda kabr main dafnane kii baat kabool kar chukaa he
 Doctor Pol named his farm house as Puru
 puru farm house
 In Marathi, 'puru' means to bury and the poll was literally burying humans alive here
 pehle hi tay kar letaa logon ke katl kii taarikhsatara police ke mutabik ab tak kii poochtacha main jo sach saamne aayaa he wo behad darwaanaa he
 Doctor Santosh Pol had made plans to kill every victim many days before

 Then he would call them at his farm house with excuses

 murge-murgiyon or unke dadbe se aane vaali gandh laashon kii badboo ko dabaa detii
 Just because of this, Dr
 Pol had opened a poultry farm in the farm house under complete planning
 
 
 
 This is why, according to the police, the coconut tree was planted, after every corpse was buried, Dr
 Pol has also explained the reason for planting the coconut tree on it
 darasal farm house ke andar har katl se kai din pehle hi doctor pole khudaai ke liye badi-badi mashine mangaata tha
 People in the neighborhood are not suspicious, so he used to tell them that coconut tree is to be planted inside the farm house, for which the land has to be excavated
 har nariyal ke ped ke neeche hogi khudiphir har katl ke baad wo sachmuch laash ke upar nariyal kaa ped laga detaa tha
 According to the police, there are more than 25 coconut trees inside the farm house
 to kya har ped ke neeche laash he? is bare main philhal police kaa yahi kahana he ki wo doctor pole se lagaataar poochtacha kar rahi he or jaanch ke dauraan jarurat padi to farm house ke andar har nariyal ke ped ke neeche khudaai jarur kii jaaegi
 According to the police, the serial killer made in the greed of money, Santosh Pol became a serial killer only and only in the greed of money, according to what has been revealed in the investigation so far

 It seems that only MCD wants to take credit for completing the slowest project in the country
 tabhi to beete dinon 20 saal se ban rahe rani jhaansi fliover kaa udghaatan hua tha or ab kishanganj railway under brij ko banane main puure 10 saal lag gaye
 On Thursday, Union Minister Harshvardhan along with various BJP leaders reached Kishanganj area of north Delhi and inaugurated a railway under bridge there
 mantri ne bhaashan main lambey-lambey kaside jarur padhe lekin yah bataanaa bhul gaye ki yah pul 10 saalon se ban rahaa he
 Actually, the construction of this under bridge started in June 2008, since then the bridge has been steadily building
 uttari dilli kii meyar aadesh gupta ne shrey lete hue kaha ki is baar ke emsidi sarkaar ne aise-aise kaam puure kiye jo beete kai varshon se adhure pade the
 But the difficulties were not any less
 North Delhi Municipal Corporation said that the project started on June 30, 2008, 200 shops, 02 transformers / sub stations and 05 religious places had to be relocated by providing alternate places
 darasal, kishanganj araubi pariyojna kii kul laagat 41
 43 crores and it has been built in collaboration with Northern Railway, Delhi Jal Board, BSES, NDPL
 yani saaf he ki jitna zyada vibhaag utana zyada samay is nirmaan ke liye laga he
 However, one thing is clear that even though the Delhi MCD runs the government in a significant part of the country's capital, the functioning of the MCD is not less than that of any rural area institution
 lokapal bill aaj manjuuri ke liye cabinet ke saamne rakhaa jayega
 The special thing is that the Lokpal bill is coming out in a new format and the government claims that it is agreed by all political parties and after the approval of the cabinet, there will be no problem in getting it passed by Parliament
 haalanki, lokapal ke liye andolan chhedane vaale anna hajaare ko sarkaar kii niyat par ab bhi andeh najar aa rahaa he
 The Lokpal whose Anna has awakened Alakh, who became the witness of the Lokpal Parliament uproar, is being brought before the Cabinet in the new format today and it is expected that it will get the Cabinet's green signal
 lokapal kaa nayaa bill puraane se kaise alag he?1
 The new bill left the right to create Lokayukta in the states to the state governments, while the old bill required the state governments to appoint a Lokayukta within a year
 rajya sarkaron ne ise unke adhikaar main dakhal maanakar joardaar virodh kiya tha
 2
 nae bill ke mutabik lokapal kii niyukti paanch log milakar karenge
 Which will include the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, Chief Justice of Supreme Court, Speaker of Lok Sabha, besides the fifth member will be PM and any jurist chosen by Leader of Opposition
 pehle niyukti pan main sirf pradhanmantri, netaa vipaksh, supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa adhyaksh ko rakhaa gaya tha
 3
 nae bill main lokapal ko sarkari karmchaariyon ke khilaaf cese chalaane kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 Earlier this authority was with the government
 4
 In the new bill, all ngos except religious institutions have been placed under the purview of Lokpal
 puraane bill main saare enjio lokapal se baahar the
 5
 nae bill main sarkari afasaron ko mauka milegaa ki wo jaanch se pehle lokapal ke saamne apana paksh rakhen
 Earlier they did not have this right
 6
 Apart from this, the government has also accepted the recommendation of the Select Committee to appoint the CBI Director of Procedure as CVC
 7
 The government has also accepted that the CBI officers who are conducting the investigation assigned by the Lokpal will also be negotiated with the Lokpal before their transfer
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle sarkaar jo lokapal bill laa rahi thi wo loksabhaa main to paas ho gaya lekin rajya sabha main atak gaya
 Then the government sent it to the Select Committee for consideration
 ab jis lokapal bill par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he usamen rajyasabha kii salect cameti kii tamaam sujhaavon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The government is confident that the new bill will pass without hindrance, but Anna, who blows the conclave of the people's revolution from Patna, is still unable to clear the intention of the government
 jabaki sarkaar apana iraadaa saaf bataa chuki he
 So the eyes are fixed on the cabinet meeting

 Advocate Abha Singh has claimed that the Maharashtra Children's Commission has ordered an FIR to be lodged against Shah Rukh in the context of a quarrel during an IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium

 ab ayog ke aadesh ke baad saalon purana maamla ek baar phir surkhiyon me aa gaya he
 However, Special Public Prosecutor PD Gharat says that it is difficult to say how much of this commission will be implemented, because the commission can recommend the investigation of a case, but cannot directly order an FIR

 That is why Ahmad, who has come to meet, has said that on this issue Mamta has said that she is in support of Kejriwal to protect the federal structure, why should the Congress not come along and ask her
 mamata ke isi rukh ko bhaanp kar ahamed patel ne khud jaakar mamata se mulaakaat kii
 Congress's message to BJP Actually, Congress wanted to keep sending the message of solidarity of the entire opposition to BJP and NDA
 aise main dilli main kejariwal ke masale par vah bijepi ke khilaaf ban rahi ekajutata ko kisi bhi keemat par kamjor nahin karnaa chaahati he
 Perhaps this may have been the reason that the Congress, sensing Mamata Banerjee's stance through Ahmed Patel, immediately found it more appropriate to meet the Trinamool chief and clear up any misunderstanding
 congress sutron ke mutabik is mulaakaat ke dauraan ahamed patel ne mamata ke saath bhavishya kii ranneetiyon par bhi charchaa kii
 Significantly, the Chief Ministers of the four states openly supported Arvind Kejriwal's dharna

 Protests took violent forms on Wednesday in many areas of Delhi

 Angry protesters damaged a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus in Bhajanpura area of north-east Delhi, while violent demonstrations also took place in Khanpur in south Delhi and some other areas in east and north Delhi
 atirikt police ayukta (uttar purv) vivi choudhary ne bataaya ki bhajanpura ilaake main bijli sankat ko lekar mangalvaar raat hue hinsak pradarshan ke silsile main teen logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 On Wednesday, dozens of Congress workers protested in Delhi's Mundka area against power cuts and raised slogans against the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party
 party netaa naresh kumaar ke netritv main pradarshnakariyon ne rohtak road ko jam kar diya, jisase kai ghante yatayaat baadhit rahaa
 Terming the BJP and AAP responsible for the power crisis, Kumar said that Congress workers will not sit silent until the power supply becomes normal
 pehle notebandi kaa virodh, uske baad bihar main endie ke chehre ke baad janata dal(you) endie main hote hue bhi aisa lag rahaa he ki bijepi ke faisle kaa virodh hi karegi
 This seems to be the case with the latest decision of Nitish Kumar's party JDU
 kyonki guuruuvaar ko hone vaale yoga diwas ke samaaroh main jediu shaamil nahin hogi
 Explain that when the tradition of celebrating Yoga Day started on 21 June, Nitish said that it was a personal rule to do yoga for what it means to perform in public
 haalanki tab nitish endie ke saath to nahin the, lekin abhi ke daur main ve endie kaa ahm hissaa hai or unki party kaa is tarah kaa faisla kaaphi hairaani bharaa he
 Well at that time he was preparing to form a Mahagbandhan and was opposed to BJP, but it is understandable that now JDU is a part of NDA, yet he has kept his distance from Yoga Day programs
 2017 july main jediu ke endie main shaamil hone ke baad yah pehla yoga diwas he
 JDU spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said there was no justification for attending the event
 rajeev ranjan ne kaha ki sabase pehali baat he ki yoga vishwa kii pracheen vidhaon main se ek he, hamaari samskruti kaa pichley 5 hajaar varshon se ek abhinn hissaa rahaa he or swasth rahane ke liye ham sab apane-apane gharon main is yogic kriya ko karte rahe hai
 He said that there is no justification for the one-day event
 is ek din ke kaarykram se kisi vyakti ko swasth rahane kaa sandesh nahin de sakate hai ye nirantar 365 dinon tak hona chahie
 He said that JDU is not joining this Yoga Day nor the state government is officially going to join this program
 lekin hamaara ye maananaa he ki yoga nishchit taur par swasth rahane kaa ek shrot he
 It is an integral part of our lifestyle
 iske liye kisi tarah ke saarvajanik aayojan main shaamil hone kaa koi auchity nahin he
 But it is a question of freedom of the person who does what they want to do, what they do not want to do
 notebandi ke faisle kaa kar chuke hai virodhbata den ye koi pehla mauka nahin he ki nitish kumaar yaa khud unki party piem modi ke kisi faisle ke khilaaf he
 Before this, Nitish Kumar himself has targeted the central government regarding demonetisation
 nitish kumaar ne notebandi ke nateezon par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki bainkon kii bhoomika ke kaaran notebandi kaa laabh jitna logon ko milanaa chahie tha, utana nahin mil paaya
 He said that banks have a big role in the progress of the country
 bainkon ko sirf jamaa, nikasi evam rin pradaan karnaa hi kaary nahin he, balki ek-ek yojana main bainkon kii bhoomika bad gai he
 At the same time, a big statement was given by JDU about the face of NDA in Bihar
 jediu kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main endie se bihar ko cheharaa nitish kumaar hi honge

 notebandi ke baad treders ko cashles hone kii jarurat padi, jiske liye baqayada vyapaariyon ne bank main swip mashin ke liye arji bhi daali, lekin dikkat ye he ki kai hafte guzar jane ke baad bhi bank se ab tak swip mashin nahin mil pai he

 When i saw that there was a lot of damage, then ordered the swipe machine but the bankers are saying that it will take 15 days
 pement ke liye mashin hi nahinmanish ke mutabik 70 se 80 fisadi bikri khatm ho chuki he or din bhar dukaan main khaali baithe rahanaa padataa he
 Buyers from both retail and wholesale come, but there is no machine for payment from card
 sawaal poochne par manish bataate hai ki notebandi kaa faisla acha he, lekin sarkaar ko ab middle class ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ke bare main sochna chahie
 Losses to Traders It is obvious that many traders want to be cashless, but due to the lax attitude of the bank administration, traders have to bear the loss

 The character is real, that's all the difference
 charles banane ke liye kya-kya kiya ?diarector praval behtareen diarector hai, aadhe se zyada kaam unhone pehle se hi kar rakhaa tha, hamane kitabon ko nahin padhaa, sirf news paper artical or footage dekhakar taiyaari kii
 His gait and manner of speaking we learned from there are a little fictional as well as reality
 kya chalange tha ?kirdaar, chaal-dhaal, tarika, or bolne kaa lahazabahut hi chalangingtha
 Did not mimicry but tried to reach that character
 aapane australia main bhi jindagi ke kuch saal gujaarey hai, kuch sahaayta mili?zyada to nahin lekin jab main australia main tha un dinon ladakiyon se baat karne kaa salika pataa lag gaya
 The film dates back to the 1970s- 80s
 charles ke bare main aap kab jane?shobhraj, nagaraj in naamon ko maine 11 saal kii umr main janaa
 Everyone trembled in his name
 amitabh bachchan saab ne bhi charles ke kirdaar kaa 'don' film main bahut phayda uthaaya he
 He is from the personal life of Dialogue Charles, the police of the country
 kya film se krime ko badhaava milegaa?maine bas us kirdaar ko nibhaane kii koshish kii he, or film ke madhyam se uski yatra dikhaai gayi he
 Anyway, in our country no one changes by watching a movie, how many people become Gandhi after seeing Munnabhai? Seeing Ramayana, did someone become Ram? This is a recreation to watch and go
 aap khud ke femes hone kaa shrey kisi dete hai?naseer saab (nasiruddin shah) ek guru ke taur par hai
 My parents, and all the people close to me, have a huge hand
 charles kii acchhee baaten aap kya dekhte hai ?wo kisi bhi insaan se milakar uski tarah dhal jaataa he
 His charm charm is also very big
 maine suna tha ki charles ke kamare se ek surang sidhe jailer madam ke kamare tak jaati thi
 What are the obstacles in getting you to succeed? My standing quote, my behavior, my absence from the industry, using my tongue to lick the ice, etc
 abhi aap charles shobhraj se kathmandu jail main milakar aaye, kaisaa rahaa anubhav?charles se milanaa mushkilanhin, naammumkin he, bahut jaddojehad kii,
 Charles has said in jail that his film is being released on October 30, we met Jailer Saab there, requested, then he took posters of our film and also did some sign and returned
 phir 10 minute milane kaa mauka mila
 First he said- 'good quality product'
 phir usne kaha kii -'hamane film ko rokane kii bahut koshish kii, lekin tumne hamen maat de di kyonki isamen amod kaant bhi shaamil the
 Then i told him - 'I have learned from you
 ' unhone kaha kii 3 november ko unki court main sunwaayee he or shaayad 3 maheene main wo chhot jaaen
 He has also sent wishes to Amod Kant
 wo 72 saal ke hai lekin bahut hi handsam hai
 i felt bad that he was still in jail
 ab hamaara prayaas he kii or koi yuva 'charles' naa bane

 These hoardings with photos of Akhilesh Yadav have been installed in many places from Lucknow to Unnao
 ravivaar ko unnav ke kareeb bangaramau main apni banaai hui expresve par fiter jet utarkar akhilesh yadav ne na sirf apane sapane ko puraa kiya balki apane virodhiyon kaa munh band karne kaa bhi intjaam kar liya
 When Akhilesh Yadav arrived in Bangarmau, Unnao, to inaugurate the 302-km expressway built in 23 months
 to mulaayam singh samet puraa kunba vahaan par maujuud tha
 Ramgopal Yadav also came and Jaya Bachchan also came
 is maukey par saath aakar yah dikhaane kii koshish hui ki parivaar ke bich kii khai ab mit chuki he or samaajawaadee party ke cycle akhilesh ke banaae hue express-ve par sarapat daudegi
 The country's largest expressway was built at a cost of Rs 13,200 crore
 302 kilometre lambii, 6 len kii is express-ve kii sabase khaas baat yah he ki ise 2 saal se kam main banaaya gaya
 The biggest thing is that for any project, land acquisition would be a very challenging task which is often mired in disputes and courts
 lekin express-ve ke liye jameen kaa adhigrahan itane shantipurna tareeke se hua ki kisi ko kaanon-kaan khabar tak nahin hui
 The expressway will start from Agra and reach Firozabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Auraiya, Kannauj, Hardoi, Kanpur and Unnao to Lucknow
 express-ve par unnav ke paas 3 kilometre kaa aisa ranve taiyaar kiya gaya he jahaan jarurat padane par ladaaku jahaaj utar sakate hai
 In normal days, this expressway will work as a road but can be used as an air strip for the Air Force by closing both sides of this 3-km road at any time of need
 sadak kaa locarpan isi jagah par kiya gaya
 For the first time in the launch program, six Mirage and Sukhoi aircraft landed here
 yah pehali baar tha jab kisi sadak par sukhoi vimaan utaar kar dikhaaya gaya
 However, just before Sukhoi came to the ground, there was chaos due to a dog coming on the road
 chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke dar se aanan-fanan main express-ve kaa locarpan to kar diya gaya lekin abhi yah puraa bilkul nahin hua he
 If you travel on the expressway, it is known that all the work from the construction of the bridge to the bridge is still left and it will take many months to start the road completely
 aadhi-adhuri sadak par log agar chalanaa shuru kar den to durghatana kaa khatra bhi kaaphi bad jaataa he
 When senior Uttar Pradesh IAS officer Navneet Sehgal was coming a few days ago to take stock of the preparations for this launch program, his car accident happened and he was badly injured and reached the hospital
 express-ve ko banavaane main navaneet sahagal ne badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 After his injuries in the accident, all the cultural events during the inauguration of the expressway were canceled
 khud upi sarkaar maan rahi he ki abhi ek maheene tak is sadak par yatayaat kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 After inaugurating the expressway, Mayawati said that Akhilesh Yadav's government is also inaugurating half-finished works just to show
 is aarope main kuch sachai bhi he kiakhilesh yadavachunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se pehle dhadadhad apni dream project kaa locarpan kar rahe hai jabaki zyaadaatar project main kaam abhi baaki he
 UP Dial Hundred and Gomti River Front were released in a similar manner last week when it has not been completed
 akhilesh yadav jaldi se jaldi lakhanu metro kaa bhi udghaatan karnaa chaahate hai
 But in spite of all this, after the expressway is ready, such a magnificent work will surely be done on which Samajwadi Party people will be proud and Akhilesh Yadav now has a good point to ask for votes in the election

 It is known that Shah Jahan built it in memory of his Begum Mumtaz Mahal, but how Mumtaz Mahal was buried in this palace remains a mystery even today
 haalanki, ek nai kitaab ne is rahasy se pardaa uthaane kaa daawa kiya he
 The book states that Mumtaz's body was buried with a mummy and Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum in the 17th century to bury Mumtaz
 vivaadaaspad i-book 'tajmahal yaa mummy mahal' ke lekhak afasar ahamed kehete hai, 'tajmahal ke bare main sach ko chipa diya gaya
 If the truth was revealed at the time of the construction of the Taj Mahal, then the construction of this sign would have been completely impossible
 ' patrkaar se lekhak bane ahamed ne apni kitaab main mumtaj kii maut se jude kai agyaat tathyon kaa bhi khulaasa kiya he
 The book also details Mumtaz's death and the last few days of his life
 kitaab main hai kai sawaalon ke javarahamad bataate hai ki antim baar dafan kiye jane se pehle mumtaj ko ek amaanat ghar main do baar-teen baar dafan kiya gaya
 But how was his body preserved during that time? Did the Mughals implement the same method used in ancient Egypt, or did it adopt another method? Did the Mughals also have a way of preserving the dead bodies? The biggest question is whether Mumtaz's body is preserved yet? The book tries to answer all these questions
 ahamed ne kaha ki ve mumtaj kii maut or uske baad uske dafan ke chaaron taraf gire rahasy ke parde ko uthaanaa chaahate hai
 Shah Jahan's court writers could cover up the entire incident, but could not do so as they were instructed not to reveal anything that would threaten to tarnish the emperor's image
 lekhak ne kaha ki pathakon ko mumtaj kii maut or dafan ke peeche kii sachai jaanane kaa adhikaar he
 The e-book also attempts to find out whether the Mughals only followed Islamic custom or implemented another method of burial

 desh ke kisi bhi hisse main hamaari paidaaish ho, bachapan se ab tak kuch sajhi kahaniyon ne hamen ek dhaage main baandha he
 According to the mood, these stories have come in our khalite
 bachapan main ramayana kii kahani
 If you want to learn love from your brother, then love of rama-laxman
 bahaduree seekhni ho to hanuman sa banane kii lalak
 Talking about cricket, the previous generation grew up listening to the stories of Sunil Gavaskar and our generation Sachin Tendulkar
 is silsile main ek naam aisa he, jo pidiyon ke paar saajha hota rahaa, kuch-kuch ramayana kii kahani kii tarah
 This name is Ramesh Sippy's 1975 film 'sholay'
 is film kaa ek-ek kirdaar or darjanon dialog hamaari jubaan par bina mehnat kiye chadh gaye
 We use them so often in everyday conversation, Goya is not a dialogue, but in our language there are idioms made in the trend for centuries
 to aise main jab is cinemai shaahakaar kaa 3di varjan cinemagharon main relies hota he, to aap ek kism ke nostalgia main ghir jate hai
 Reviewing Sholay as a film critic is beyond capacity
 magar ek darshak ke taur par par bhi is film ko 70 mem ke parde par dekhnaa khaas kism kii anubhuti detaa he
 But some have to write with anger that the 3D version of the film Sholay released today spoils the fun
 film main 3di kaa asar do baar saaf taur par dikhataa he
 First, when Jai and Veeru arrive in a goods train with Inspector Baldev Singh and the train collides with wooden logs laid by dacoits on the track
 kuch latth udate hue darshakon tak bhi aate hai
 The second opportunity comes when Inspector Jay shoots Veeru's shot to open
 goli lohe ko bhedati hui cinema haul ke paar jaati he
 But apart from a few such scenes, 3D technology is a burden on the film
 meri samaj main behatar yah hota ki film ko 2di takanic ke saath hi bade parde par dikhaaya jaataa
 Another work could have been done and that its edited scenes would have been combined with the original film
 yaa phir ant main vah seen bhi dikhaae jate, jo baad main story badalane ke pher main hataa die gaye
 For example, the incident of Gabbar's death at the hands of Thakur Baldev Singh
 iskaa video utyub par bahut hit he
 But during the Emergency, this scene was removed to establish the importance of law
 asal seen yah tha ki maukey par pahunchaa inspector thakur ko kanoon ke prati sammaan kii baat yaad dilaataa he or pratishodh main kaanpata thakur kaa pair aakhri prahaar se pehle ruk jaataa he
 However, everyone listened and listened to one side
 jai viru kii dosti, gabbar ke khauf, thakur kaa krodh, basanti kii shokhi yaa phir suurama bhopali ke majaak dekhnaa har baar jaadui hota he
 It is like going through a grandmother's story, which never gets old
 tumhaara naam kya he basanti, ab tera kya hoga kaaliya, ye haath hamen de de thakur, chhammakachllo jab tak tere pair chalenge, isaki saans chalegi
 
 
 This series of dialogues does not stop anywhere
 sholay shandaar he or agar 3di varjan kii takneekee khaamiyon ko darkinar kar sakate hon, to bade parde par dekhne ke laalach ko puraa karnaa gunaah nahin hoga
 Similarly, there are many people in our generation who have not watched Sholay sitting leisurely on TV
 unke liye bhi ye ek acha mauka sabit ho saktaa he

 228 chhakkon ke saath ipel ke sixsar king kris gail ab england main dhamal machaa rahe hai
 When he went to play for Somerset for the first time, his style was so explosive that he scored a brilliant century in the first match
 is daurankris gailne 15 chakke jade or ant tak out hue bina 62 gendon par 151 thok daale
 In this T20 Blast match played on Sunday, Kent batted first and scored a huge mountain of 227 runs at the loss of seven wickets thanks to Sam Northeast's best 114 runs innings
 lakshya kaa peechha karne utari summerset kii team ke pehle do wicket keval 22 ranon par nikal gaye
 When Gayle landed, he hit three sixes in the first eight balls, then like a lion, this snow man of cricket hit 15 sixes one after the other
 is dauraan teen baar aisa mauka aayaa jab gend stadium se baahar paas hi main bahati nadi main ja giri or gaayab ho gai
 However, despite this wonderful innings, Gayle could not win his team Somerset against Kent
 summerset ke coach or apane jamaane ke aakraamak ballebaaj mathew menard ne kris gail kii is pari ko kuch yun bataaya, ‘mujhe laga ki sam northist ne sansanikhej pari kheli lekin jab cricket kaa yah bos pich par utraa tab uskaa andaaj hi kuch or tha
 i do not have the words what i saw today
 usne is bade score ko bada hi aasaan bana diya
 He was getting the ball out of the ground in very precise form
 uski yah pari itane bade score ko aaj maat dete-dete bas kuch faasale se rah gai
 It was the sight of Chris Gayle's explosive innings that the victory was visible in Somerset's hands until the ball just before the final ball of the match
 lekin is gend ne match ko summerset ke haathon se nikaal kar kent ke haathon main rakh diya kyonki is gend ko gail dot khel gaye
 Although he hit a six off the last ball as well, it was not enough to win and Somerset's team lost the match by three runs
 match ke baad kent ke captain northist ne kaha, ‘kahaan se shuru karun yah main nahin jaanata
 It was a great match
 kris ke jaisi dhuandhar ballebaaji maine aaj tak nahin dekhi
 But i want to give special credit to our bowlers who stick to their fixed plans
 hamane yah bhi koshish kii ki duusare ballebaaj zyada batting karen lekin jab bhi hamaare gendbaajon ne length par gendbaaji nahin ki wo use park ke baahar bhej detaa tha
 "he said," When the opposition team has scored an average of 15 runs, then you will think that there is nothing left in the match
 lekin jab kris pich par khadaa ho or aapke saamne 20 ran prati over kii ausat bhi ho to aap jaanate hai ki ye ban saktaa he
 He is an extraordinary cricketer

 HIGHLIGHTS: Must see action from our high scoring @ natwestt20blastmatch yesterday! -http: / / t
 co / vek1u4aeff # gayleforce # gaylestorm— Somerset Cricket (@somersetccc)june 1, 2015 Swami Chakrapani raised questions on JNU students: Those who say Mr
 Ram should get fee benefits - Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Chakrapanidilli is furious over the fees
 fees badhotaree ke khilaaf jeenyu chaatr campus se lekar sadak tak virodh pradarshan kar rahe hai or sarkaar se faisla waapas lene kii maang kar rahe hai
 The matter has reached the discussion of Parliament and meanwhile, the Hindu Mahasabha chief Swami Chakrapani has also commented on the issue
 hindu mahasabha ke pramukh swami chakrapani ne kaha ki 'jai shri ram', 'bharat mata kii jai' or 'vande maataram' kahana jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main kam fees kaa laabh uthaane ke liye ek shart honi chahie
 Swami Chakrapani termed most of the students studying in the university as 'anti-india' and said that the reasoning behind his demand is that the students there are 'anti-national'
 swami chakrapani ne ieenes se baat karte hue kaha, 'mata-pita apane bacchon ko khaanaa khilaate hai
 But, this does not mean that they cannot discipline them if they are misguided
 jo chaatr bhatak gaye hai, unhen bhi anushaasit karne kii jarurat he
 'asked if Jai Shri Ram is a religious slogan, he said,' The one who will take the name of Lord Shri Ram will remain restrained
 agar aap unka naam nahin lenaa chaahate, to aap 'vande maataram' or 'bharat mata kii jai' to kah sakate hai
 You can say this aisa karnaa deshbhakti he

 'bojirao mastaani' ke baad mashhoor film mekar sanjay lila bhansaali period film 'padmavati' bana rahe hai
 Ranveer Singh, Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone in the lead roles
 vah isaki shooting karne rajasthan ke jaipur gaye
 There on Friday evening, he was attacked by Karni Sena, an organization associated with Rajput society
 unka aarope he ki bhansaali film ke liye aitihaasik tathyon ko tod-marod kar pesh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, a character from the past has again become the headline and people have suddenly become interested in the role of 'padmavati'
 sawaal yaheen se shuru hota he ki aakhir rani padmavati koun thi? vah aitihaasik kirdaar hai yaa keval saahitiyik kirdaar hai
 If you look in the mirror of the past, then it is believed that this character was first discussed in the 15-16 century
 darasal malik mohammad jaaysi ne 1540 isvi ke aasapaas mahakavy 'padmavat' likhaa tha
 According to that work, Rani Padmavati was the wife of King Rawal Ratan Singh of Chittor
 tippaniyan It is told in that story that Rani Padmavati was the owner of unmatched beauty
 dilli kaa shaasha allaudin khilji un par aasakt tha
 He attacked Chittor in 1303 to get Padmavati and the Rajputs lost in that war
 khilji jab mahal pahunchaa to usne dekha ki rani padmavati samet rajput mahilaon ne johar kar liya tha
 Jauhar was a practice in the medieval era when the Rajput kings killed themselves en masse to escape the clutches of the enemy after they were killed in battle
 haalanki isaki pramanikta ko lekar itihaaskaaron main matbhed hai
 Many historians believe that there was no character named Padmavati in history
 unke mutabik padmavati keval ek saahitiyik kirdaar thi or vah aitihaasik kirdaar nahin thi
 These historians say that no such character is mentioned in the time of Alauddin
 ve maanate hai ki chaaran parampara, lok kathaon, vaachak parampara or janashruti ke chalate yah kirdaar sadiyon se jivit he
 The question starts from here, who was Rani Padmavati after all? He is a historical character or a mere literary character
 ateet ke aaine main yadi jhaank kar dekha jaae to mana jaataa he ki 15-16veen sadi main yah kirdaar sabase pehle charchit hua
 Actually, Malik Muhammad Jaisi wrote the epic 'padmavat' around 1540 AD
 us kriti ke mutabik rani padmavati, chittod ke raja rawal ratan singh kii patni thim
 The comments us kahani main bataaya gaya he ki rani padmavati apratim saundarya kii malikaa thim
 The ruler of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji, was enamored of them
 padmavati ko paane ke liye usne 1303 main chittod par hamalaa kar diya or rajputon kii us yuddh main haar hui
 When Khilji reached the palace, he saw that Rajput women including Rani Padmavati had committed Jauhar
 johar madhyayug main ek aisi pratha thi jab rajput raajaaon ke yuddh main maare jane ke baad unki raniyaan dushman ke changul se bachane ke liye samuhik rup se aatmadah kar leti thim
 However, historians differ on its authenticity
 kai itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki padmavati naam kaa koi kirdaar itihaas main nahin tha
 According to him, Padmavati was only a literary character and was not a historical character
 ye itihaaskaar kehete hai ki allaudin ke jamaane main is tarah ke kisi kirdaar kaa zikr nahin miltaa
 They believe that this character has survived for centuries due to the Charan tradition, folk tales, reciting tradition and public opinion

 From Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, there should be 5 seats in the Lok Sabha and 24 seats in the assembly, according to BJP MP Nishikant Dubey
 nishikant dube vah saansad hai, jinhone do baar privet member bill laakar loksabhaa main paak adhikrut kashmir ke logon ke liye 5 siten rakhane kii maang kii thi
 But his bill was rejected at that time
 pioke ko lekar modi sarkaar ke badale ravaiye aurapradhamanantri ke haalia bayaanke baad ab dubaara se yah maang uthi he
 BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the government will consider it
 unhone kaha, 'modiji is mudde ko lekar gambhir hai or privet member bill laane kii jarurat nahin padegi
 Dubey further said that now the government will bring its bill in this direction so that people of Takipiokok can get 5 seats in Lok Sabha
 saansad kaa yah bhi kahana he ki bharat jaldi hi mujaffarabad main bhi tirangaa jhanda fahraayega
 The government has to decide these things: In J&K, about 24 assembly seats and five seats in Lok Sabha, Jitendra Singh says that there is a provision in the state that 24 seats have been kept there
 lekin isamen koi aadchan nahin he
 The government has to decide all these things
 jammu kashmir main gathbandhan kii sarkaar he or mukhya mudda vikaas he
 There, 5 seats in the Lok Sabha will have to be decided collectively
 manovaigyanik sudhir kakkad ne paanch saal pehle elaan kiya tha ki paramparaagat bhartiya pariwaron ke angan main kaamuk pyaar kii prasav pidaa utarane lagi he
 Now it seems, there is a stir that gives air to that yearning
 india today group-emdiare ke 2013 ke sex survey ke nateezon se pataa chalata he ki kakkad jis cheez kii paidaaish kii baat kar rahe the, uski prakriya ab bhi chal rahi haih ham aise saanskrithik andolan ke daur main hai jisamen bhartiya jodon main maadak pyaar kii ahmiyat badhati ja rahi he
 In this way, another cultural movement is gaining momentum within the spontaneous cultural movement of sex
 kartavya or bade parivaar (ye yugal jiskaa hissaa hote hai) se paaramparik praathmik nishtha kii jagah ye jode ab dhire-dhire khud ko zyada mahatv dene lage hai
 Confirming the continuation of this trend, the 2013 figures also speak of a change: in the last few years, there has been a change in the Indian woman's xxrep 4 x or, say, erotic attitudes
 yah tathy us tadap kii prasav pidaa ko hawa dene kii takat liye hue he
 XXX desires - the ability and confidence to be sensual / look, knowing and saying "I have a wish" and fulfilling it by moving forward
 samaaj kii apekshaaon ne isi pahalu par ankush lagaakar rakhaa he
 Till now, men and women were kept separate before marriage
 is arotic ichchhaaon par lagaam kaa ek or sookshm tarika manovaigyanik zyada haih striyon kii kaamuk udaan ke pankh yonik pavitrataa ke khaanche main rakhkar baandh dena
 In an invisible psychological process, the restrictions on XXX desires of deep-rooted women are based on an old system
 vah pranali jisamen bachapan se hi pratyaksh-paroksh rup se unki nigaraanee kii jaati he
 This is an old custom, which has been going on from generation to generation
 hindu kanoon samhita ke pracheen granth ‘‘manusmriti’’ main kaha gaya he, ‘‘jo striyaan apni suraksha khud karti hai, unki hi behatar suraksha ho sakati he
 "the women's own watchfulness involves many aspects
" masalan usamen sex kii chahat ko na panpane dena or unamem yonik bholaapan paidaa karnaa
 In women, it has been a condition of attaining sisterhood
 sex ke maamle main zyada vaachaal striyon kii duusari striyaan malamat karti hai or apane daayre se baahar kar detii hai
 This pimple of self-control is started from childhood through mother-daughter relationship
 iske baad parivaar ke baaki log or puraa samudaay iskaa samarthan karata he
 It is shameful for a woman to openly express her sexual desires and it is considered as inviting rape
 stri kii arotic satta par ankush lagane main sammaan-sajaa kii yah mili-juli vyavastha bahut vajani sabit hoti he
 It is very difficult for any woman to appear in the bedroom as a cultural ambassador of virginity and purity and also be satisfied
 kyon? kyonki sharir kii swaabhaavik maang ko dabaane ke liye baari sanyam kii jarurat hoti he; jo striyaan aisi ichchhaaon ke jaal ko katkar shuchita praapt kar leti hai, unhen bharat main ooncha sthaan or pahchaan milti he
 In such a backdrop, the findings of the 2013 India today-mdra survey on women increasing sexual expression cannot be taken lightly
 lambey samay se chali aa rahi striyon ke yonik bholepan ko samarthan dene vaali saanskrithik dashaon ke bich bhartiya striyon kaa apni yonik jaruraton kaa izhaar or santushti kii maang vastav main ek counter culture he
 This small group advocating the sexual rights of the Indian woman was strongly in need and it has taken a long time to come
 mahilaon ke anand ke vishay main likhte hue 2012 main india today main lekhika tishaani doshi ne kaavyatmak bodh ke saath is group ke liye ek roopak istemaal kiya tha
 While refreshing the whispering image of fluttering flies together to keep each other warm on a frosty cold night, he wrote, "what," we also do not collectively do this to protect ourselves And when we do this, will some wings fly here and there in the sky? ”the words of this poem fall against sexual guardianship
 yah un striyon kii aakanksha he,jo yon-anand kii parampara main ek-duusare ko pyaar or samarthan detii hai
 This is also reflected in this year's figures
 2013 main yon paharedaariki uplabdhi kii disha palat rahi he
 Until now it was not possible to express the pleasure of the woman's body even in solitude
 yonikavikas main hastmaithun ke aa judye kii baat samajhane ke liye ise teen tatwon main baantkar dekhen-aatm-anand, yonik jigyaasa or yonik vaidhaniktaa
 The third element is heavier on both
 teenon tatv yon kshamta ke liye ek buniyaad kii tarah hai
 Female masturbation figures are still much lower than men, but they are important as indicators of a change in XXX power
 2013 ke survey main anand kii chahat rakhane vaali 27
 6 percent of women stand in front of cultural forces who consider the natural nature of self-exploration and self-pleasure irrational
 27
 This figure of 6 is also a figure of continuous association with bliss and conservatism
 27
 Do not compare 6 percent to 68 percent of women who refuse masturbation, but to women who have refused to answer the question
 survey ke dauraan bahut-si mahilaon ne is sawaal se naaraaz hokar kaha ki yah unki ‘‘samskruti par hamalaa he
 These women, who refuse to communicate about sex and consider themselves excellent cultural messengers, are proof that Manusmriti has taken root in India even today
 yonik vaidhaniktaa ko samarthan dene ke liye pankh katarne ke is lambey raste main mardon ne bhi ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 The same example of what men are doing will be enough: the trend of enjoying sexual moments from an affair other than marriage is being challenged by this year's figures
 isamen mardon kii bevafaayee ke aankade die gaye hai
 The increased commitment of "talkers" to a relationship with a wife may be an indication that erotic love is developing in India
 isi tarah apni yon-ichchhaaon ke dohan ke bare main mardon ke shekhi baghaarne main kami kaa aankada kuch ummidajanak haih shaayad striyon ko ab samajhane kii pravriti bad rahi he, bajaae unhen anand kii vastu samajhane ke
 Like the figures of women, the figures of men also show that there is a conflict between modern erotic love and the old values of keeping erotic love out
 bhartiya purushon main mahila kii youniktaa ko ahmiyat dene kii badi kshamta ke bich mahila ko sampatti samajhane kii saamanti chaaya ab bhi barkaraar he
 The picture that looks forward to the future of erotic love in India cannot be created without this confrontation: Sexual conservatism has remained a collective identity of Indians for centuries
 isamen bahut badlaav to nahin aayaa he, lekin 2013 ke survey se ek sambhaavna ke upar se paradaa jarur hatataa haih aage ek kaamuk bhavishya dikh rahaa he, hamaari atitjivita main ek tarah se sur main sur milaataa hua-yaa use khaarij karata hua
 This is a possibility that is unknown as a closed invitation letter but it does raise hope: a sense of sex for both partners, not to go beyond the gendered roles of the gender, not to endanger the woman's own sex or her sexuality, Men interested in having sex with a partner
 hamaare desh main yonik vikaas ke paimaane badal rahe hai

 It is worth noting that till today, Quattrocchi has not appeared in any court of India to face the case
 darasal, sibiai ne aktubar 2009 main adaalat se kwatrochi ke khilaaf maamla khatm karne kii ijaajat maangi thi
 The CBI had argued for this that the prosecution on it was unfair for various reasons

 unheen logon ke bich aa gaya he jo 67 saal main baatcheet kar, aapas main ladbhidakar bhi nateeja nahin nikaal sake
 Gradually, the issue got out of politics and settled in the court's court and general peace was generally established
 media ne upi ke har chunaav main bijepi se poochkar ise public main laane ke tamaam prayaas kiye ki mandir kab banegaa magar bijepi bhi adaalat ke faisle kii baat kar apni duusari ranneetiyon ko anjaam dene main jute gai

 The evening of TV is decorated with the same question, same answer
 ab roj koi na koi kuch na kuch bolegaa or jaruri kaam chhodkar isi par tivi kii sari urja kharch hogi
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said that it would be better for both the parties to settle this issue together
 ye maamla dharm or aasthaa se judaa he
 Therefore, the two sides sit together and try to find a solution through dialogue
 zarurat padi to supreme court ke jaj bhi madhyasthata karne ko taiyaar hai
 The Chief Justice also said that if both parties do not find a solution, then the court will be ready to hear the matter and give its verdict
 lekin donon pakshon ke sabhi log teble par baithkar baatcheet karenge, usamen nishpaksh logon ko bhi shaamil karenge to zyaada acha rahegaa
 The Supreme Court has asked in this case to explain on March 31 what has been decided
 26 farvari 2016 ko supreme court ne bijepi saansad subramanyam swami ko ayodhya vivaad se jude sabhi maamalon main pakshakaar mana tha
 Swamy says that the case has been pending in the Supreme Court for six years
 supreme court ko rojaanaa sunwaayee kar jald faisla sunaanaa chahie
 Reacting to the remarks of the Chief Justice, Swamy said that the two communities will not sit together on this issue, it is better the court give its verdict
 sava sau saal purana he ayodhya vivaad
 In the fire of this issue, many of the communities lost their lives, some lost their jobs and some were made leaders

 This is why the three-judge bench of Allahabad High Court gave a major verdict in the Ayodhya dispute case on 30 September 2010

 They were Justice SU Khan, Justice Sudhir Aggarwal and Justice Dharamvir Sharma

 The decision also came but nothing happened
 shaayad tab tak upi or desh kii janata is mudde kaa khel samaj gai thi
 In the last sixty years, all the courts, all the judges kept hearing this matter but could not reach the floor of writing the judgment
 elahabaad hoicourt main 20-21 saal sunwaayee ke baad pehali baar is vivaad se jude ek pahalu par faisla aa gaya
 All three sides were accepted
 ab sirf yah tay karnaa tha ki koun sa hissaa kise milegaa, magar sabhi pehle faisle ke khilaaf supreme court chale gaye

 In this way, this is the decision whose entire nation is waiting for breath
 
 
 
 And Justice Khan writes the verdict

 After the verdict, no one was interviewed or appeared in the media
 jaj kaa jo kaam hota he wo karke ja chuke the
 In this decision, he has written one more thing

 Talks have been attempted 10 times

 The atmosphere of the conversation is not much more than what is called

 On July 27, 2010, an order was also passed stating that today we have also considered the possibilities of resolving the dispute through dialogue

 Nevertheless, we have told all learned lawyers that as long as the verdict is being delivered, they are exempted to try to negotiate through negotiations and, if necessary, contact OSD to set up the bench

 On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict

 Which said that there should be no interference in the faith of Hindus
 supreme court tippanee main dharm or aasthaa kaa naam lekar baatcheet kaa ek or mauka dene kii baat kar rahaa he
 So the conversation has become political

 Should not everyone wait for the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Do our courts remain apprehensive in the name of faith or a widespread response among the people
 unki chintaa main yah hota he ki faisle ke baad kya hoga
 Is it not a matter of concern? november 2015 main jab haazi ali main auraton ke pravesh ko lekar bambe hoicourt ke saamne yachika ai to justise viem kanaade ne kaha ki ye jo samay he wo ashishnutaa kaa samay he
 People often become sensitive in religious matters, so we usually try not to interfere
 is maamle main bhi adaalat ne sabhi pakshon se guzarish kii thi ki aapasi baatcheet se sulajhaa len
 It is not that the courts have not given the verdict against public sentiment, but the issue which has reached the last court of the court in 67 years, why is it sending on the failed table of negotiation from there
 khaskar tab jab sab adaalat ke aadesh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baithe hai, raji hai
 The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said that it would be better for both the parties to settle this issue together
 ye maamla dharm or aasthaa se judaa he
 Therefore, the two sides sit together and try to find a solution through dialogue
 zarurat padi to supreme court ke jaj bhi madhyasthata karne ko taiyaar hai
 The Chief Justice also said that if both parties do not find a solution, then the court will be ready to hear the matter and give its verdict
 lekin donon pakshon ke sabhi log teble par baithkar baatcheet karenge, usamen nishpaksh logon ko bhi shaamil karenge to zyaada acha rahegaa
 The Supreme Court has asked in this case to explain on March 31 what has been decided
 26 farvari 2016 ko supreme court ne bijepi saansad subramanyam swami ko ayodhya vivaad se jude sabhi maamalon main pakshakaar mana tha
 Swamy says that the case has been pending in the Supreme Court for six years
 supreme court ko rojaanaa sunwaayee kar jald faisla sunaanaa chahie
 Reacting to the remarks of the Chief Justice, Swamy said that the two communities will not sit together on this issue, it is better the court give its verdict

 In the fire of this issue, many of the communities lost their lives, some lost their jobs and some were made leaders

 Ayodhya dispute is 125 years old
 is masale kii aag main donon samudaay ke na jane kitnon kii jaan chali gayi, kitnon kaa rojgaar chhina or kitnon ko netaa bana diya
 Neither a temple was built nor mosque breakers were caught
 supreme court kii avmaananaa karne vaale bhi batch gaye
 Why is the Supreme Court hearing for 6 years
 isliye ho rahi he ki elahabaad hoicourt kii teen jajon kii bench ne 30 sitambar 2010 ko ayodhya vivaad maamle main ek bada faisla diya
 Two of the three judges were unanimous and one voted separately
 ve the justise es you khan, justise sudhir agarwal or justise dharmaveer sharma
 When the verdict was about to come on 30 September 2010, there was silence all over the country and especially UP
 faisla bhi aayaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Perhaps by then the people of UP and the country had understood the issue of the game
 pichley saath saal main tamaam adaalatein, tamaam jaj is maamle kii sunwaayee karte rahe magar faisla likhane kii manzil par nahin pahunch sake
 After hearing 20-21 years in the Allahabad High Court, a decision was reached on one aspect related to this dispute for the first time
 teenon pakshon kaa hissaa maan liya gaya
 Now it was only to decide who would get which part, but all went to the Supreme Court against the first decision
 justise es you khan kii bench ne tay karte hue kaha ki muslim, hindu or nirmohi akhaada ko is vivaadit jameen kaa sanyukt hissedaar banaaya jaataa he
 The area of the middle dome where the idol is currently kept will be given to Hindus
 nirmohi akhaada ko wo hissaa diya jayega jo map main ram chabutara or sita rasoi ke naam se he
 a bench of two ratios one to three judges headed by Justice SU Khan raised the controversy to a point where the final verdict began to appear
 teen jajon ne is faisle ke liye 9000 se adhik panne likhe hai
 i would like to mention the lines that Justice SU Khan started his decision so that you can understand the challenges of a judge while writing this difficult decision
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 In the judgment of sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others, what SU Khan starts with is a matter for law students, you can also understand that it is not easy to write a judgment in this matter
 Will be, but anyone can write if they want
 justise khan in panktiyon se shuruuaat karte hai - yahaan 1500 varg gaj jameen kaa ek tukdaa he jahaan devtaa bhi guzarane se darate hai
 It is filled with countless landmines, land mines
 hamen ise saaf karne kii jarurat he
 Some good people have advised us not to even try
 ham bhi nahin chaahate hai ki kisi murkh kii tarah jaldbaaji karen or khud ko uda len
 Despite this, we have to take risks
 kisi ne kaha he ki jivan main sabase bada jokhim hota he ki mauka aane par jokhim hi na liya jaae
 Once the gods were also forced to bow before humans
 ye ek aisa hi mauka he
 Have we succeeded or failed? There can be no judge in your case
 is tarah ye rahaa wo faisla jiskaa puraa desh saans roke intjaar kar rahaa he
 
 
 
 or justise khan faisla likh dete hai
 Had decided to give a decision
 faisle ke baad kisi ko intervyuu bhi nahin diya na media ke saamne aae
 The judge's work was done by him
 isi faisle main unhone ek or baat likhi he
 Which is closely related to the Supreme Court's comment
 10 baar baatcheet kii koshish hui he
 The attempt to negotiate with former Prime Minister Chanshekhar is considered to be the closest to success, but ultimately all failed
 baatcheet ke naam jitani koshish nahin hoti usase kahin adhik maahaul ko garmaya jaataa he
 a bench of Justice SU Khan also gave a chance to negotiate
 27 july 2010 ko ek aadesh bhi paas hua tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aaj hamane baatcheet ke zarie vivaad ko sulajhane kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kiya
 Nothing concrete has come out yet
 phir bhi hamane sabhi vidwaan vakeelon se kaha he ki jab tak faisla sunaaya ja rahaa he tab tak unhen chhot he ki ve baatcheet ke zarie samjhaute kaa prayaas karen or zarurat padane par oesady se bench gathit karne ke liye sampark kar sakate hai
 July to September arrived but there was no attempt to negotiate
 30 sitambar 2010 ko elahabaad hoicourt ne faisla hi suna diya
 That decision was also well reviewed
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki hinduon kii aasthaa main hastkshep nahin honi chahie
 In the comments, the Supreme Court is talking about giving another opportunity for dialogue by taking the name of religion and faith
 lihaaza baatcheet raajnneetik ho chali he
 Why does not the Supreme Court, like the Allahabad High Court, hear the daily and take forward the decision of the High Court
 kya sabhi ko sarvocch nyaayalay kaa intjaar nahin karnaa chahie
 The comments kya hamaari adaalatein aasthaa ke naam par yaa logon ke bich vyapak pratikriya ko lekar ashankit rahati hai
 Their concern is what will happen after the verdict
 kya aisa hona chintaa kii baat nahin he
 In November 2015, when a petition came before the Bombay High Court regarding the entry of women into Haji Ali, Justice VM Kanade said that this is the time of intolerance
 dharmik maamalon main log aksar samvedansheel ho jate hai, isliye ham aam taur par koshish karte hai ki dakhal hi na den
 In this case also, the court had requested all the parties to resolve it through mutual negotiation
 aisa nahin he ki adaalaton ne janabhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar faisle nahin die hai magar jo masalaa 67 saal main adaalat kii antim dehri par pahunchaa he, vahaan se baatcheet kii asafal mez par kyon bheja rahaa he
 Especially when everyone is sitting to accept the court order, they are ready
 30 sitambar 2010 ko jab faisla aane vaala tha tab puure desh or khaskar upi main sannata chaa gaya tha
 The decision also came but nothing happened
 shaayad tab tak upi or desh kii janata is mudde kaa khel samaj gai thi
 In the last sixty years, all the courts, all the judges kept hearing this matter but could not reach the floor of writing the judgment
 elahabaad hoicourt main 20-21 saal sunwaayee ke baad pehali baar is vivaad se jude ek pahalu par faisla aa gaya
 All three sides were accepted
 ab sirf yah tay karnaa tha ki koun sa hissaa kise milegaa, magar sabhi pehle faisle ke khilaaf supreme court chale gaye
 a bench of Justice SU Khan held that Muslim, Hindu and Nirmohi Akhada are made joint share holders of the disputed land
 bich vaale gumbad kaa kshetra jahaan philhal murti rakhi hui he, wo hinduon ko diya jayega
 Nirmohi Arena will be given the part which is named as Ram Chabutara and Sita Rasoi in the map
 justise es you khan kii adhyakshata main do anupaat ek se teen jajon kii bench ne is vivaad ko aise mukaam par pahunchaa diya jahaan se antim faisla kareeb dikhne laga
 Three judges have written more than 9000 pages for this decision
 justise es you khan ne apane faisle kii shuruyaat jin panktiyon se kii he uskaa zikr karnaa chahta hum taaki aap is mushkil faisle ko likhte samay ek jaj kii chunautiyon ko samaj saken

 Justice Khan starts with these lines - here 1500 square yards is a piece of land where even the gods are afraid to pass
 yah anginat barudi surangon, land mins se bharaa hua he
 We need to clean it up
 kuch bhale logon ne hamen salaah di he ki koshish bhi mat karo
 We also do not want to hurry up like a fool and blow ourselves up
 baavjood iske hamen jokhim to lenaa hi he
 Somebody has said that the biggest risk in life is that risk should not be taken at the chance
 ek baar devataaon ko bhi insaanon ke aage jhukne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 This is one such opportunity
 ham safal hue hai yaa naakaam rah gaye hai? apane cese main koi jaj nahin ho saktaa he
 In this way, this is the decision whose entire nation is waiting for breath
 
 
 
 And Justice Khan writes the verdict
 tay kar liya tha ki faisla dena he
 After the verdict, no one was interviewed or appeared in the media
 jaj kaa jo kaam hota he wo karke ja chuke the
 In this decision, he has written one more thing
 jiskaa supreme court kii tippanee se gaharaa taalluk he
 Talks have been attempted 10 times

 Nevertheless, we have told all learned lawyers that as long as the verdict is being delivered, they are exempted to try to negotiate through negotiations and, if necessary, contact OSD to set up the bench
 july se sitambar aa gaya magar baatcheet kaa koi prayaas nahin hua
 On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict

 Which said that there should be no interference in the faith of Hindus

 So the conversation has become political

 Should not everyone wait for the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Do our courts remain apprehensive in the name of faith or a widespread response among the people
 unki chintaa main yah hota he ki faisle ke baad kya hoga
 Is it not a matter of concern? november 2015 main jab haazi ali main auraton ke pravesh ko lekar bambe hoicourt ke saamne yachika ai to justise viem kanaade ne kaha ki ye jo samay he wo ashishnutaa kaa samay he
 People often become sensitive in religious matters, so we usually try not to interfere

 It is not that the courts have not given the verdict against public sentiment, but the issue which has reached the last court of the court in 67 years, why is it sending on the failed table of negotiation from there

 Nirmohi Arena will be given the part which is named as Ram Chabutara and Sita Rasoi in the map
 justise es you khan kii adhyakshata main do anupaat ek se teen jajon kii bench ne is vivaad ko aise mukaam par pahunchaa diya jahaan se antim faisla kareeb dikhne laga
 Three judges have written more than 9000 pages for this decision
 mention the lines that Justice SU Khan started his decision so that you can understand the challenges of a judge while writing this difficult decision
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 In the judgment of sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others, what SU Khan starts with is a matter for law students, you can also understand that it is not easy to write a judgment in this matter
 Will be, but anyone can write if they want
 justise khan in panktiyon se shuruuaat karte hai - yahaan 1500 varg gaj jameen kaa ek tukdaa he jahaan devtaa bhi guzarane se darate hai
 It is filled with countless landmines, land mines
 hamen ise saaf karne kii jarurat he
 Some good people have advised us not to even try
 ham bhi nahin chaahate hai ki kisi murkh kii tarah jaldbaaji karen or khud ko uda len
 Despite this, we have to take risks
 kisi ne kaha he ki jivan main sabase bada jokhim hota he ki mauka aane par jokhim hi na liya jaae
 Once the gods were also forced to bow before humans
 ye ek aisa hi mauka he
 Have we succeeded or failed? There can be no judge in your case
 is tarah ye rahaa wo faisla jiskaa puraa desh saans roke intjaar kar rahaa he
 
 
 
 or justise khan faisla likh dete hai
 Had decided to give a decision
 faisle ke baad kisi ko intervyuu bhi nahin diya na media ke saamne aae
 The judge's work was done by him
 isi faisle main unhone ek or baat likhi he
 Which is closely related to the Supreme Court's comment
 10 baar baatcheet kii koshish hui he
 The attempt to negotiate with former Prime Minister Chanshekhar is considered to be the closest to success, but ultimately all failed
 baatcheet ke naam jitani koshish nahin hoti usase kahin adhik maahaul ko garmaya jaataa he
 a bench of Justice SU Khan also gave a chance to negotiate
 27 july 2010 ko ek aadesh bhi paas hua tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aaj hamane baatcheet ke zarie vivaad ko sulajhane kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kiya
 Nothing concrete has come out yet
 phir bhi hamane sabhi vidwaan vakeelon se kaha he ki jab tak faisla sunaaya ja rahaa he tab tak unhen chhot he ki ve baatcheet ke zarie samjhaute kaa prayaas karen or zarurat padane par oesady se bench gathit karne ke liye sampark kar sakate hai
 July to September arrived but there was no attempt to negotiate
 30 sitambar 2010 ko elahabaad hoicourt ne faisla hi suna diya
 That decision was also well reviewed
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki hinduon kii aasthaa main hastkshep nahin honi chahie
 In the comments, the Supreme Court is talking about giving another opportunity for dialogue by taking the name of religion and faith
 lihaaza baatcheet raajnneetik ho chali he
 Why does not the Supreme Court, like the Allahabad High Court, hear the daily and take forward the decision of the High Court
 kya sabhi ko sarvocch nyaayalay kaa intjaar nahin karnaa chahie
 The comments kya hamaari adaalatein aasthaa ke naam par yaa logon ke bich vyapak pratikriya ko lekar ashankit rahati hai
 Their concern is what will happen after the verdict
 kya aisa hona chintaa kii baat nahin he
 In November 2015, when a petition came before the Bombay High Court regarding the entry of women into Haji Ali, Justice VM Kanade said that this is the time of intolerance
 dharmik maamalon main log aksar samvedansheel ho jate hai, isliye ham aam taur par koshish karte hai ki dakhal hi na den
 In this case also, the court had requested all the parties to resolve it through mutual negotiation
 aisa nahin he ki adaalaton ne janabhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar faisle nahin die hai magar jo masalaa 67 saal main adaalat kii antim dehri par pahunchaa he, vahaan se baatcheet kii asafal mez par kyon bheja rahaa he
 Especially when everyone is sitting to accept the court order, they are ready
 justise es you khan ne apane faisle kii shuruyaat jin panktiyon se kii he uskaa zikr karnaa chahta hum taaki aap is mushkil faisle ko likhte samay ek jaj kii chunautiyon ko samaj saken
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others ke faisle main es you khan jis baat se shuru karte hai wo kanoon ke chaatro ke liye nazir to he hi, aap bhi samaj sakate hai ki is maamle main faisla likhnaa aasaan nahin hoga, magar koi chaahe to likh saktaa he
 Justice Khan starts with these lines - here 1500 square yards is a piece of land where even the gods are afraid to pass
 yah anginat barudi surangon, land mins se bharaa hua he
 We need to clean it up
 kuch bhale logon ne hamen salaah di he ki koshish bhi mat karo
 We also do not want to hurry up like a fool and blow ourselves up
 baavjood iske hamen jokhim to lenaa hi he
 Somebody has said that the biggest risk in life is that risk should not be taken at the chance
 ek baar devataaon ko bhi insaanon ke aage jhukne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 This is one such opportunity
 ham safal hue hai yaa naakaam rah gaye hai? apane cese main koi jaj nahin ho saktaa he
 In this way, this is the decision whose entire nation is waiting for breath
 
 
 
 And Justice Khan writes the verdict
 tay kar liya tha ki faisla dena he
 After the verdict, no one was interviewed or appeared in the media
 jaj kaa jo kaam hota he wo karke ja chuke the
 In this decision, he has written one more thing
 jiskaa supreme court kii tippanee se gaharaa taalluk he
 Talks have been attempted 10 times
 purv pradhanmantri chanshekhar ke saath baatcheet kii koshish ko safalataa ke sabase kareeb mana jaataa he magar antim taur par sab naakaam rahi
 The atmosphere of the conversation is not much more than what is called
 justise es you khan kii bench ne bhi baatcheet kaa ek mauka diya tha
 On July 27, 2010, an order was also passed stating that today we have also considered the possibilities of resolving the dispute through dialogue
 abhi tak kuch bhi thos nahin niklaa he
 Nevertheless, we have told all learned lawyers that as long as the verdict is being delivered, they are exempted to try to negotiate through negotiations and, if necessary, contact OSD to set up the bench
 july se sitambar aa gaya magar baatcheet kaa koi prayaas nahin hua
 On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict
 us faisle kii bhi khub samiksha hui
 Which said that there should be no interference in the faith of Hindus
 supreme court tippanee main dharm or aasthaa kaa naam lekar baatcheet kaa ek or mauka dene kii baat kar rahaa he
 So the conversation has become political
 ucchtam adaalat kyon nahin elahabaad hoicourt kii tarah rojaanaa sunwaayee kar ucch adaalat ke faisle ko aage badhaati he
 Should not everyone wait for the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Do our courts remain apprehensive in the name of faith or a widespread response among the people
 unki chintaa main yah hota he ki faisle ke baad kya hoga
 Is it not a matter of concern? november 2015 main jab haazi ali main auraton ke pravesh ko lekar bambe hoicourt ke saamne yachika ai to justise viem kanaade ne kaha ki ye jo samay he wo ashishnutaa kaa samay he
 People often become sensitive in religious matters, so we usually try not to interfere
 is maamle main bhi adaalat ne sabhi pakshon se guzarish kii thi ki aapasi baatcheet se sulajhaa len
 It is not that the courts have not given the verdict against public sentiment, but the issue which has reached the last court of the court in 67 years, why is it sending on the failed table of negotiation from there
 khaskar tab jab sab adaalat ke aadesh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baithe hai, raji hai

 This is the reason why the All India Congress Committee has consulted Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh by phone
 ek angreji akhbaar ke mutabik congress komanipur main bijepi dwaara satta hathiyaaneki bhanak lag chuki he
 Chief Minister Okram removed some ministers from the post
 is faisle ko kuch baagi vidhayakon ne chunauti de di he
 The Congress high command is trying to maintain peace due to the fear that this dispute should not fall apart like Uttarakhand and Arunachal
 arunachal pradesh or phir uttarakhand main satta ganvaane ke baad congress isliye bhi satark he kyonki donon rajyon main baagi vidhayakon ko dal-badal virdohi kanoon ke tahat fansaaya nahin ja saktaa
