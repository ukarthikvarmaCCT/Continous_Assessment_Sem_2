 bas saat saal pehle tak ye shahar naa sirf zindaa tha
 Rather than life
 khubsuurati itani ki unesco kii bhi nazar lag gai ise
 Therefore, UNESCO ranked this city as a World Heritage
 gulzaar dakaane, restaraan, masjid, girjaghar shahar kii dhadakanen thim
 The home of the narrowly built home town in which people lived
 ab khandhar ban chukaa he homesji haa
 This is the same city as Holmes
 khandhar main tabdilho chukaa homes
 At first glance, it seems as if some district was visited in this city
 jisane puure shahar ko khandhar bana diya
 Yes, the district came par kudarat kaa nahin balki jang ke bhukhe insaanon ke bamon or barood kaa zalzala
 Which made an entire city ruins on sight
 iesas or syria kii vidrohi sena
 They are responsible for making this city ruins
 yahi jimmedaar hai syria ke tisare sabase bade shahar homes kii is haalat ke liye
 Every building has fallen prey to bombs, tanks, shells and mortars
 viraan ho chukaa shaharis shahar ke khandhar ho jane kii tasviir shaayad hi itani jaldi saamne aati
 But a recent drone footage by coincidence recorded the destruction of the city
 tab pataa chalaa ki is shahar par hajaaron-lakhon ton barood or bad-bade bam barase
 The bombs rained down from the sky, ruining the entire Holmes city with laughter
 alam ye ki ab tasveeron main bhi insaan najar nahin aa rahe
 By 2011, the capital of the revolution had a million inhabitants
 shahar ke log behad jinda dil or khule mizaaj ke the
 Even women used to come out with men without hijab
 lekin tabhi 2011 main sab badal gaya
 There was a revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-assad
 vidrohi sena ne sabase zyada gadar isi homes shahar main machaaya or is shahar kaa naam kranti kii rajdhani rakh diya
 The war between the Syrian government and the rebels began to maintain the rule of the bloody struggle over the city of Hajhoms
 jang khinchati rahi
 Then during this time ISIS was born
 bagdadi ke aatankwaadi iraq hote hue syria ja pahunche
 From Syrian capital Damascus to Homs, the battle was now trivial
 dekhte hi dekhte shahar main khooni sangharsh shuru ho gaya
 By now, the Syrian government had heavily bombed its own city
 paris hamale ke baad achaanak rus bhi iesas ke khilaaf maidan main kud padaa
 To help the Syrian President
 ab roosi bam bhi is shahar par girane lage
 The rain of thousands of corpses of bomb everywhere made 95 per cent of the city of Holmes ruins
 hajaaron log maare gaye
 To save the rest of his life, he left his Holmes and left for Mahfuz hideout
 barood se bojhal sari fizaa
 Is the air of death
 ye marate bachche haathon main
 This mother's cry in the nights
 maaloom nahin ye kisi jang he? kiske liye jang he
 No one wins in this battle
 haaregaa insaan hi

 Save daughter, teach daughter
 yah naaraa aapako ab har tempo trek ke peeche dikh jaataa he
 Often in this slogan we emphasize on the teaching of daughters but the emphasis should be on the first line
 beti bachaao par
 Whom to save and why
 kya yah naaraa isliye nahin he ki hamaara samaaj betiyon ko garbh main maarane vaala rahaa he or garbh se betiyaan baahar bhi aa gayi to sadakon par jala kar maar detaa he yaa balaatkaar se maar detaa he
 It seems that all our anger about daughters got out during the Nirbhaya movement
 uske baad kis vajah se yah bharosa ban gaya ki ab sab thik he, pataa nahin
 Don't we all now come forward because of the fact that the caste of the girls being burnt has to be accounted for? jati ke hisaab se unke insaaf kii ladaai tay hoti he
 In the last few days, there are three such news that girls have to be burnt to death
 16 disambar ko uttarakhand ke paudi main 18 saal kii ladki ko jala diya jaataa he
 On December 18, a 15-year-old girl is burnt to death in Agra
 23 disambar ko telugana main 22 saal kii ek ladki ko maar kar jala diya jaataa he
 The girl who was burnt on the middle road in Agra had a dream of becoming an IPS
 marate marate vah ladki apni maa se kah gai ki uske insaaf ke liye ladati rahe
 He was burnt on 18 December and today the culprits who burned him could not be caught till 24 December
 sawaal he ki insaaf ke liye kahaan or kisase lade koi?print website par nandita singh ne vistaar se report kii he
 Before dying, this girl told her mother that i could not fight in my life but you do not leave
 uske baad usne dam tod diya
 His body was burnt to 50 percent
 10veen class main padhane vaali yah ladki college se ghar ke liye nikali thi ki us par ek hamalavar ne petrol daal diya
 The other threw the lighter
 wo jala di gai
 Was taken to SN Medical College, Agra, from there to Safdarjung Hospital but died
 18 ko jala di jaati he or 20 ko uskaa nidhan ho jaataa he
 Both attackers are still unknown and have not been arrested
 anusuchit jati kii is ladki ke parivaaravaalon kaa kahana he ki jati kii koi bhoomika nazar nahin aati he
 Her father has said that he had no quarrel with anyone in the neighborhood
 lekin do maheene pehle jab ve kaam se laut rahe the tab kisi ne unke sir par peeche se maaraa tha
 Was quite hurt
 unhen laga ki koi chote-mote badmaash rahe honge
 He did not register a case with the police
 ise ipies banane kaa sapana aata tha, pita kehete the ki unke bas kii baat nahin, magar khud par bharosa itnaa tha ki kahati thi kisi bhi tarah se ipies ban jaaegi
 The end of its dream in India, it feels quite safe on Twitter today
 maa anshan par baith gai he
 Was watching local media reporting on the incident
 23 taarikh ke amar ujaalaa main likhaa he ki jab is ladki ko jalaayaa gaya to koi bachaane nahin aayaa
 At that time 40 to 50 people were present there
 agra dehaat ke uske gaanv ke log pareshaan hai
 It is said that this 15 year old girl is of independent mood
 inter college kijike compatishan main cycle jeet kar laai thi
 It was fast in mathematics
 is ghatana ke baad uske chachere bhai ne bhi aatmahatya kar lee
 Whether it is related to the murder of a sister, nothing has been established yet
 apradhi bhi giraftaar nahin hai
 After this massacre, the social and political organization of Agra city has organized several marches
 insaaf ke naare lagaae gaye hai
 There is a lot of anxiety among the vigilant people of Agra city due to no arrest
 koi sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahaa he to koi faansee kii sazaa kii maang kar rahaa he
 Such demonstrations give credence that there are some people in the society who are coming forward against it, but whenever i see the demand of hanging in their slogans, i think that everyone has got in the form of a Rata Rataya formula slogan
 yah pataa he ki faansee kii sazaa ke baad bhi balaatkaar or is tarah kii ghatnaayen nahin rukii hai
 The entire focus is on punishment and many years are spent in punishment, the question of system and society is lost somewhere in between
 to in nek dil vaale pradarshnakariyon ko isi vakt sochna chahie ki unke pradarshan se samaaj main kis tarah ke sawaal paidaa hon, kis tarah kii baaten hon
 It should be appreciated that he did not look towards Delhi
 apane shahar ke bheetar se hi pratirodh kii awaz paidaa kii he
 In Agra, the citizens have been taken out to come on the streets and counteract this incident
 vipaksh ke kai netaa is gaanv main pahunch kar parivaar ko santvanaa de rahe hai or nagarikon kii awaz kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 On the second day of the incident, UP Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma reached the spot and assured of action
 rahul gandhi ne fasebuk par likhaa he ki agra kii ghatana dil dahala dene vaali he
 Save the daughter in the BJP rule, what could be the worse misfortune of the daughter's education, that the daughter who studies is set to fire anti-social elements
 mayawati ne is ghatana kii ninda kii he or kaha he ki upi main jangal raaj he
 Chandrashekhar of Bhim Army has tweeted that if the culprits are not caught, they will do something like Bharat Bandh like April 2
 yahi nahin anusuchit jati ayog ke rashtriya adhyaksh ramshankar katheria bhi parivaar se milane gaye the
 He is also a BJP MP from here
 unki maa ne kaha ki hamen muawza nahin chahie, aparaadhiyon kii giraftaar or sazaa chahie
 a girl was burnt in Agra
 hamane us ladki kaa naam nahin liya jabaki sara shahar uskaa naam lekar narebaazi kar rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has imposed a restriction that the girl's identity should not be revealed in such cases
 magar court ne aparaadh kii ghatana ko ujagar karne par koi roak nahin lagaai he
 There are laws related to media reporting about children
 bhartiya press parishad adhinium ke mutabik balaatkaar, mahila ke apharan athwa bachche par yon hinsa se jude aparaadh va vyaktigat charitra par andeh karne sambandhi maamalon or mahila kii niztaa sambandhi maamalon kii reporting karte samay peedit ke naam, photograph or pahchaan sambandhi anya vivaranon ko prakashit nahin kiya jayega

 a 22-year-old girl got married outside the caste
 us ladki ko rishtedaaron or parivaar waalon ne use buree tarah maaraa or phir jala diya
 Think the whole family is busy killing a girl because she is married outside the caste
 ladki bunakar samaaj se thi or lakshmana obisi tha
 At times, it seems that where we have failed, due to which, there has been so much hatred and violence in the society
 3 disambar ko donon ne apni marji se hyderabad ke arya samaaj mandir main shaadi kar lee
 Both came out of their village to Hyderabad, 250 km away
 gaanv se rishtedaar or parivaar vaale peeche peeche aa gaye or ladki ko ghar se khinch le gaye
 Laxman was also beaten up
 uttarakhand ke paudi main college main practical pariksha dene ke baad apni skuti se laut rahi ladki ko banty naam ke ek driver ne sunsaan ilaake main roka, ladki ne uskaa virodh kiya to usne petrol chhidak kar kar usapar aag laga di, ladki 70 fisadi jal gai
 He was first sent to the local hospital in Pauri and then to the base hospital in Srinagar
 vahaan se rishikesh ke ames main bheja gaya
 How much of the AIIMS is beaten
 bataaiye agar ames main ilaaj kii vyavastha nahin he to baaki aspataalon kaa kya haal hoga
 The girl from AIIMS in Rishikesh was sent to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi where she died on Sunday
 18 saal kii beti kii maut kii khabar sunakar maa ko heart atake ho gaya
 The society failed this girl, the system failed her even more
 ek dryver is ladki ke peeche padaa tha
 He had been following for five years and one day he sprinkled petrol and burned it
 hamaare samaaj main prem ko lekar itani hinsa he ki kai baar lagata he ki nafrat hi bhartiya samaaj kaa aafitial sanskaar he

 Although Salman Butt's ban ended in September 2015, the national selectors are still confused about his selection
 tippaniyan An insider from the board stated that the confusion is because Butt was the rig leader of the spot-fixing scandal and he is concerned about what the reaction will be to Butt's return

 Gujarat cadre IPS officer Rajneesh Rayne submitted his resignation to the government on Tuesday
 1992gujaratader ke ipies adhikari rajnish raay philhal andhra pradesh ke chitoor menciarpfmen karyrat hai
 Rajneesh Rai, who resigned as an IPS officer, is the second Gujarat cadre IPS officer
 isse pehle gujarat main rahul sharma ne bhi apana istipha saunp diya tha
 Rajneesh Rai has been in controversies as an IPS officer
 vah sabase pehle tab vivaadon main aae jab gujarat main modi sarkaar thi, or soharabuddin kefrji encountermaamle main gujarat ke hi duusare ipies adhikari diji vanjaaraa or duusare pulicekarmiyon ko onduty giraftaar kiya tha
 In Gujarat, Rajneesh Rai, Rahul Sharma and Satish Verma are the three IPS officers who openly opposed the government's work after the Modi government came in 2001
 rahul sharma tab vivaadon main aae the, jab unhone godhra dangon kii jaanch kar rahe ayog ko mobile lokation or sabhi netaaon ke phone kii sidi di thi
 Rajneesh Rai had accused the IPS officer DG Vanzara and his team of being very close to the Modi government, while confusing the Sohrabuddin encounter, while Satish Verma had called Ishrat encounter fake
 2014 main modi sarkaar ke centre main aane ke baad rajnish raay kaa transfar andhra pradesh main siarpief main kar diya gaya tha
 After the Modi government came in, Rajneesh came into the limelight last year when he gave a report to the top officials of CRPF detailing how the army, paramilitary forces and the Asompolis executed a fake encounter on March 29-30 in Simalguri area of chirang district
 Diya and two persons were killed as members of NDFB (S)
 iske badasupreme courtne centre sarkaar, diphen ministry, assam sarkaar or siarpief se jawaab-talab kiya tha
 After this, Rajneesh Rai was transferred to Andhra Pradesh in June this year without any reason
 2ji ghotaale main 122 companiyon ko die spectrum license cancel karne kaa aadesh dene vaale supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish justise ji es singhvi ne saaf kiya he ki vishesh adaalat se aae faisle ko supreme court ke faisle se jod kar dekha janaa uchit nahin he
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Justice Singhvi clearly said that he had only come to terms with the spectrum allocation process in which the court ruled on the evidence and the arguments presented
 lekin sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke saamne aayaa mukadmaa bilkul alag tha
 It is a case of criminal embezzlement and misuse of government position and status
 justise singhvi ne kaha ki hamaare saamne to jab maamla aayaa usase saaf ho gaya ki jis tarah companiyon ko spactrum license baante gaye uski prakriya main khami thi
 Implementation of the first-come-first-served policy rather than the bidding process also saw many flaws
 license cancel hone ke baad sarkaar ne phir se unheen kii nilaamee kii to 64 hajaar karod rupee se zyada rakam sarkari khajaane main ai
 Justice Singhvi also said that only the evidence that is presented before any court reaches the verdict
 adaalatein kabhi bhi khud saboot nahin taiyaar karatin
 This work belongs to the investigating agencies
 sabooton ko kaise tarateebavaar pesh kiya jaae or unke mutabik daleelein di jaaen tabhi adaalaton ko sara maajaraa samaj main aata he, or saath hi saath hamen ye bhi gaur karnaa chahie ki aropiyon ko doshamukt karnaa yaa phirasbooton ke abhaav main barikarna donon bilkul alag alag chijen hai
 They should be understood accordingly
 justise singhvi ke kathan ko is alok main bhi dekha jaay ki jaise hi faisla aayaa bijepi netaaon ne supreme court ke faisle ke sathvishesh sibiai adaalat ke saath tulanashuru kar di
 In the first-come-first-served policy, spectrums were also given to our own people at a quarter to one price
 kai companiyaan jinka tele communication se dur-dur tak koi lenaa dena nahin tha unako bhi spectrum alaat ho gaye the
 Crores of rupees were transferred from here to there in a strange and poor manner
 yani sarkari niti ke saath-saath uske amal main pag-pag par gadabadiyaan dikhin
 In view of them, the Supreme Court had ordered the cancellation of licenses granted to those companies
 ab vishesh adaalat ne apane faisle main aapraadhik maamle ko samagrata se dekhte hue faisla diya he
 In such a situation, it is not appropriate to weigh or watch both the cases and both the decisions on the same pan
 saath hi sabooton ke abhaav main bari kiye jane kaa ye matlab katai nahin he ki aaropee ne aparaadh kiya hi nahin
 If we look at some old cases which are important in the Jessica Lal murder case or the Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case, the trial court acquitted the accused in both the famous and sensitive murder case but they were sent behind bars in the upper court
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki kya sibiai or idi ke adhikari vishesh adaalat ke faisle se uthe sawaalon ko gambhirtha se lenge
 
 
 Because in the clear words many questions have been raised by the court on the thought, understanding and understanding of the officers of the investigating agencies

 As many Indian soldiers were killed in this world war, not many soldiers have been martyred in the war after independence

 At that time, these soldiers went from France, East Africa to Iraq to fight on behalf of Bitrain

 He was not young, but his memories were definitely refreshed
 pehle teenon senaaon ke supreme commander or raashtrapati pranab mukherjee aaye the or aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi aae
 The contribution of these jawans in history has been almost forgotten, but after a hundred years, it is a good effort to remember those Indian soldiers who waved in the world of their valor

 However, Rekha had openly admitted in her interview that she had an affair with senior Bachchan
 jabaki amitabh ne is baat ko puri tarah afvaah bataaya tha

 But believe me, at this time, people have started knowing the CMO in Lucknow under the new name of corruption, murder and officer
 or jaane bhi kyon nahin
 After the murder of three cmos one after the other, now the arrest of another former CMO has made this serial killing of three thousand crores, which is the biggest murder mystery in the country
 dow
 VK Arya died on 27 October 2010

 BP Singh was assassinated on 2 April 2011
 iske baad police hiraasat main dow
 YS Sachan was assassinated on 22 June 2011
 sutron ke mutabik serial kiling main maare jane vaale tisare siemo yani doctor sachaan ne apni maut se ek din pehle police ko bataaya tha ki doctor shukla hi wo ahm shaks he jo is serial kiling kii gutthi sulajhaa saktaa he
 According to Sachan, Shukla knows every buried secret of the 3000 million serial killing
 par isse pehle ki doctor sachaan is serial kiling main doctor shukla ke shaqik hone yaa naa hone par kuch or bol pate unka katl kar diya gaya
 The police kept quiet for a few days after the murder of Dr
 Sachan in jail
 lekin jab log sadakon par utar aae to nae sire se police ne teen hajaar karod kii is serial kiling ke filon ko phir se palatnaa shuru kiya
 The police found the signature of doctor Shukla in these files
 ye dastakhat ishaara kar rahe the ki hajaaron karod ke is ghapale or gaban main doctor shukla ek ahm kadi hai
 In a few days of investigation, it became clear that even if Dr
 Shukla is not directly involved in this serial killing, he is definitely involved in this scandal
 or mumkin taur par teenon katl ke dabe raaj bhi jaanate hai
 Just after this, police came into action and on Tuesday, Dr
 Shukla was arrested from the trauma center of Lucknow Medical College
 police ne doctor shukla par par vahiin iljaam lagaae hai jo dow sachaan par lage the
 Dr
 against Doctor Sachan beepi singh ke qatl ke teen din baad yani 5 april ko ghapale kaa cese darj hua tha or dow
 Against Shukla, two days after it i
e
 on 2 April
 lekin sutron kii maane to upree pahunch ke chalate tab doctor shukla ko giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 The fate of three cmos is in front of the era
 ab chauthaa siemo yani doctor shukla police kii giraft main he
 What will happen next? Will Shukla reveal the secret or is Dr
 himself on target shukla?teen hajaar karod kii is serial kiling kaa ab ye sabase bada suspence he
 Dr
 Shukla's arrest has once again brought back the story of Doctor Sachan
 dar is baat kaa he ki kahin sach saamne aae usase pehle doctor shukla kii jubaan bhi band naa kar di jaae, or isi ashanka ke maddenjar hai court ne naa sirf doctor shukla ko jail main kadi nigaraanee main balki choubison ghante camere ke saamne rakhane kaa hukum sunaaya he
 Have you ever heard that any prisoner inside the jail has been in camera for 24 hours? You may not believe it but it is going to happen
 teen hajaar karod ke ghapale or serial kiling ke iljaam main giraftaar purv siemo doctor eke shukla ab jab tak jail main rahenge choubison ghante camere ke saamne honge
 Dr
 shukla ko camere kii nigaraanee main rakhane kaa hukmdoctor sachaan kii jail ke andar hatya se khud adaalat hairaan he
 And this is the reason that on Tuesday, when the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court ruled to send Dr
 Shukla to 14 days judicial custody, it also ordered that Dr
 Shukla should be monitored round the clock by CCTV camera Be kept
 hycourt ne iske saath hi jail prashasan ko sakht hidaayat di he ko wo doctor shukla ko kadi suraksha main rakhe
 Actually, due to the murder of three cmos one after the other, the court does not want to take any offense regarding the safety of Dr
 Shukla
 purv ke teen siemo ke hashr ko dekhte hue khud doctor shukla kaa parivaar bhi unki suraksha ko lekar ashankit tha
 Actually, since this three thousand scam salmon has come, since then it is being said that big and powerful people are behind it
 yahaan tak ki isi serial kiling ke iljaam main giraftaar ek shooter anand tiwari ne apni jaan ko khatra bataate hue suraksha kii maang kii he
 Shooter Anand Tiwari said that we are in danger of our lives because there are many big people behind this scandal
 daraa hua sirf anand tiwari hi nahin he
 Abhay Singh, another pawn of this serial killing, who is currently imprisoned in jail, is also badly hurt that he should not be erased by erasing evidence himself
 is ghapale or serial kiling se jude har chote pyaade or afasaron ko apni-apni jaan kaa khatra he, or khatra ho bhi kyon naa
 Those who can enter inside the prison and stop the speech of Doctor Sachan can be easily assessed
 vaise aapako ye bhi bataa duun ki nyaayik jaanch main ye sabit ho gaya he ki doctor sachaan ne khudakushi nahin kii thi balki jail ke andar unki hatya kii gai thi
 Dr
 sachaan kaa jail ke andar qatl hua thatin hazaar karod ke ghotaale kaa sabase bada suspence yahi he ki do siemo ko saream goli maari jaati he
 And the third CMO, who is arrested for both the murder charges, is himself murdered inside the jail
 phir katl ke baad sajeesh rachi jaati he
 The corpse is hung with a fan
 taaki duniya ko maamla khudakushi kaa lage
 However, the Chief Judicial Magistrate in his report has finally exposed the conspiracy
 magistrate ne mangalawar ko hai court main saunpi apni report main saf kaha he ki dow
 Sachan was killed inside the jail under a conspiracy
 dow
 According to the names of those who created the conspiracy to unravel the conspiracy, Dr
 a day before his death
 sachaan ne jail main kuch kaidiyon se elanitha taur par kaha tha ki unhen is serial kiling main bali kaa bakra banaaya ja rahaa he
 Dr
 sachaan ne kaha tha ki wo police ko un sabhi logen ke naam bataaenge jo sidhe taur par is ghotaale se jude hai or jinka is sajeesh main haath he
 In fact, on June 17, the UP police caught three shooters and revealed in a press conference that Dr
 sachaan ne saat lakh kii supaari dekar siemo hatyakand ko anjaam diya
 As soon as this news reached Dr
 sachaan bhadak uthe
 On 23 June, Dr
 sachaan ko police remand par lekar poochtacha honi thi
 According to sources, Dr
 sachaan ne apane ghar waalon ko bhi bataa diya tha ki wo police ko is puri sajeesh main shaamil rusuukh vaale logon ke naam bataa denge
 But one day before going on police remand i
e
 on June 22, Dr
 sachaan kii rahasyami haalat main maut ho gai
 a death that the police and the government were constantly committing suicide
 lekin police or sarkaar kii dhajjiyaan uda deen dow
 Sachan's postmortem report
 police baar-baar doharaati rahi ki dow
 Sachan carved the belt around his neck and then cut his veins
 jabaki postmortem report ke mutabik dow
 The trap in the neck of Sachan was tightened after his death
 report main kaha yaa he ki dow
 There were a total of nine scars in Sachan's body
 inamen se aath marane se pehle ke the
 Whereas the ninth wound, the scar on the throat, was after death
 or bas isi report ne nyaayik jaanch main ye sabit kar diya ki ductor sachaan ne khudakushi nahin kii thi balki unka katl kiya gaya tha
 On the streets of Lucknow, two cmos are roasted with bullets outside their house
 jaanch hoti he or phir police in donon katl kaa iljaam doctor sachaan par daal kar unhen giraftaar kar leti he
 But after this, Doctor Sachan himself gets murdered inside the jail
 ek ke baad ek teen sansaneekez moutis khooni silsile kii shuruyaat koi saalon pehle nahin hui
 Rather the case is just 8 months back
 khooni khel kii shuruyaat hui 27 aktubar 2010 ko jab hajaaron karod kaa hisaab-kitaab karne vaale siemo wike aryaa ko subah-subah lakhanu main unheen ke ghar ke baahar goliyon se bhun diya gaya
 As a proof, the police should take only kiosks of bullets from chance-e-vadat 
 arya ke katl ke baad dipti siemo sachaan ko kaaryakari simo bana diya gaya
 But then on 20 January, the government appointed BP Singh as the new CMO on the basis of service selection
 beepi singh ne pad sambhalate hi ghapalon kii jaanch karaani shuru kar di
 But the investigation still went ahead that only then did they meet the same fate as Arya, the former CMO
 isi saal 2 april ko thik doctor arya kii tarah hi doctor beepi singh ko bi subah-subah unke ghar ke baahar subah ke vakt goliyon se chalni kar diya gaya jab wo tahalne nikle the
 Due to chance, police also found empty kiosks of cartridges just this time
 jaise pehle katl main mili the
 Two cmos were murdered
 maamla sangeen tha
 Hence the investigation was handed over to the STF
 jaanch main paaya gaya ki donon hatyaon main ek hi hathiyaar kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 This result was based on the empty kiosks found on k in the ballistic report
 yani makasad chaahe jo ho, kaatil ek tha
 But the secret deepened because the police caught the murderer differently, despite the weapon being one
 doctor arya ke katl main purvanchal ke mafia sargana abhaya singh ko mukhya aaropee banaaya gaya
 Rather, the head of Dr
 BP Singh's murder was torn to the head of Dr
 Sachan
 police kii is jaanch par sawaal uthne lage or sarkaar kii saakh par ungliyaan uthni shuru ho gayi
 The opposition was now speaking openly that in this serial killing, the government is daubing to save its two big leaders
 udhar police is baat par adi rahi ki doctor sachaan ne sarkari paise kaa jamkar ghotaalaa kiya tha
 They were afraid that they would be caught if they were investigated
 isi se bachane ke liye unhone pehle dow vinod aryaa kii hatya karai or phir dow
 Of BP Singh
 lekin jab doctor sachaan kii hi jail main maut ho gai to dabi jubaan main ye kaha jane laga ki serial kiling kaa mastermind koi or he
 Someone else is creating the real game and the real conspiracy, and he is so powerful that even the police are preventing him from reaching
 par wo he koun?kya do-teen siemo itane bade ghapale ko akele anjaam de sakate hai? kya itnaa bada khel sirf afasaron ke bich khelaa ja saktaa he? jaahir he ye baat kahin se hazam karne laayak nahin he
 The strings of the plot are far up
 par kitne upar tak?bol to sab rahe hai
 But no one is saying
 raaj, dow
 Knew the truth lekin unhen bolne nahin diya gaya
 This is true of this three thousand crore serial killing
 darasal sutron kii maanon to is serial kiling ke peeche sirf or sirf paison kii bandarbaant he
 The killing of both cmos and then the death of Dr
 Sachan is linked to the nexus between the leader, the officer and the criminal
 daplasal upi ke parivaar kalyaan vibhaag main centre se teen hajaar karod se zyada ke fund aae the
 In this fund of NHRM, there was open loot and monkey money
 sutron kii maane to paison kii bandarbaant main naukarshah or netaa sabase aage the
 When these murders became headlines, the then Health Minister Anant Mishra had to resign under public pressure
 iske baad parivaar kalyaan mantri babulal kushvaha ko bhi janaa padaa
 But the question arises that if Kushwaha was sitting at the top of the NHRM fund then why did the police not interrogate Kushwaha? Similarly, why the then Health Minister Anant Mishra was also kept out of the investigation? Finally, the question is only of one line, whether two-three officers sitting in a CMO post like huge amount of three thousand crores can burp alone? The question is also why the resignation of two ministers was taken
 And the question is whether anyone is above these ministers
 jo inase bhi taqatvar he? zaahir he bol to sab rahe hai par kah koi nahin rahaa
 Everyone is saying that the death of all cmos is a conspiracy and the powerful people who created the conspiracy
 par ye koun log hai? koun he jinaki pahunch jail ke andar tak he? jaahir he is puure maamle ke har pahalu ko samajhnaa aapke liye jaruri he
 There are two big faces of UP politics Babulal Kushwaha, about whom it is said that no one is as close to Mayawati as she is
 jab swasthy mantralay me teen hajaar karod ke fund aane shuru hue to kushvaha sahab ko parivaar kalyaan kaa mantri banaaya gaya
 Anant Kumar Mishra is the other face
 ye whupi ke purv health manistar hai jo upi ke number tu kahe jane vaale satish chandra mishra ke khaas hai
 We showed you these two important faces of UP because after one after the other killing of this serial killing (second murder is shown by BP Singh), under public pressure, Mayawati government had to resign Kushwaha and Anant Mishra
 lekin istife se bhi baat nahin bani
 Because three thousand crores is not a nominal amount
 isse pehle ki upi sarkaar kii police maamle ko rafa-dfa karti ki tabhi teesri maut ho gai
 a death that confused the government
 uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar jile main hatya kaa ek aaropee us samay police hiraasat se bhaag niklaa, jab use adaalat main peshi ke liye mujffarnagar se meerut le jaaya ja rahaa tha

 isi dauraan dilli-dehradun rajmarg par aaropee kaidi muntalib donon police waalon ko chakma dekar bas se kud kar faraar ho gaya

 He is registered as a 'history Sheeter' at Purakaji Police Station

 is baat ko sach sabit kiya he bhavesh bhaatia ne
 Even though he cannot see with eyes, but he is providing employment to such people who cannot see the world like Bhavesh
 yah unki mehnat kaa hi fal he ki kabhi pheri lagaakar apana ghar chalaanevaale bhavesh aaj 25 karod rupee ke turnover vaali sunrise company ke maalik hai
 Bhavesh was not blind since childhood
 unke ankhon kii roshni dhire-dhire jaati rahi
 He was suffering from a disease called retinal muscular deformation
 isamen marij ke ankhon kii roshni samay ke saath ghatati jaati he
 His classmates also used to make fun of him due to this disease
 unhone jab isaki shikaayat apni maa se kii unhone samajhaayaa ki ve tumhaare dost banane ke liye aisa karte hai
 Just by learning this mother, he made friends of all those who sometimes tease him because of his weakness
 bhavesh jab 23 saal ke the unki ankhon kii roshni puri tarah chali gai or yaheen se shuru hua tha sangharsh kaa kathin daur
 But it is said that trouble does not come alone and brings with it even more troubles
 jab unki ankhon kii roshni gai tab unki maa kaa cancer kaa ilaaj kaa chal rahaa tha or vah iske liye rakam jodne kaa prayaas kar rahe the
 But his mother could not survive despite the expense
 iske baad bhavesh bahut tut gaye the lekin maa kii ek sikh unhone ganth baandh lee thi ki agar vahaduniyanheen dekh sakate to kuch aisa karen ki duniya unako dekhe
 After this, Bhavesh started looking for something that would not only make his life better but he could also improve the lives of all others like him
 kaise hui bijness kii shuruyaat:bhavesh ko bachapan se hi haathon se choti-choti chijen bananaa acha lagata tha
 First they made kites and after that they started making candles
 isi bich unhenprashikshanki jarurat mahasoos hui to unhone neshnal association of blind institute se mombatiyaan banane kaa prashikshan liya
 Then he started selling hand-made candles on handcuffs in the local market of Mahabaleshwar
 mombatti ke bijness ne hi dilaayaa jeevanasathi :apni jivan sangini nita se bhavesh kii mulaakaat mombatiya ke jariye hui
 She had come to buy candles from him and was impressed by his behavior and gave her heart to him
 kaaphi milane-julne ke baad unhone shaadi karne kaa faisla kiya
 Although Nita's family strongly opposed this, she did not change her decision
 nita kaa saath milane ke baad unki jindagi thodi aasaan jarur hui lekin ghar kii aarthik sthiti tab bhi acchhee nahin thi
 There was no loan for business from anywhere
 unki jindagi kaa sabase bada samay vah tha jab unhen satara bank se 15 hajaar rupee kaa lone mila
 From this, he bought wax, wheelbarrow and many other things needed
 mehnat rang laai or unka bijness chal niklaa
 He later formed the Sunrise Candles Company which today produces 9000 simple and fragrant candles
 aaj unke graahakon kii list main reliance industries, big bazaar, ranbaxy, narod industries or rotary club jaisi pramukh companiyaan hai
 At present the turnover of this company is more than 25 crores

 When India overtakes China as a major economic power in the world, it will have a special contribution especially from the gwalior-chambal region as it has talented entrepreneurs and farmers with every resource
 isaki shuruuaat bhi ho chuki he or ab chambal kii dharti dakait nahin balki madhya pradesh or desh kii tarakkee main yogadan dene ke liye taiyaar ho chuki he
 This was stated by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan in 'india Today: Udta Chambal Summit'
 chambal kii badalati tasviir par unke alaava is kaarykram main kendriya gramin vikaas rajya mantri pradeep jain or bollywood kalakaar navazuddin siddiki bhi shariq hue
 Chief Minister Chouhan said at the Udta Chambal Summit organized by India Today on June 16 at Hotel Usha Kiran Palace in Behgwalior, “there is now peace among the ravines of Chambal
 dakaiton kaa aatank nahin he or aane vaale samay main yahaan ke yuva udhyami nai pahchaan banaaenge
 The state government is helping in this and is working to create such infrastructure in the ravines of Chambal, which will help the youth
 sarkaar ek audyogic galiyara bana rahi he, jo chambal nadi se shuru hokar muraina, gwalior, shivpuri or guna tak jayega or rashtriya rajmarg ke donon ore udyog lagenge
 For this, more than 5,000 hectares of land has also been selected
 chambal ke behad, jinamein lakhon hectare jameen banjar he, iskaa upyog udyog lagane or samtal karke township viksit karne kii bhi yojana he
 There are more than 37 engineering colleges in Chambal region and the youth here do not have to go out of the state, IT parks have been set up in Gwalior and Indore
 pehle tisies or infosis jaisi companiyaan rajya main aati nahin thi, lekin ve apane project yahaan lagane ko taiyaar hai
 Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain insisted on formulating a separate policy for the state government for the overall development of Chambal
 unhone kaha ki agar rajya sarkaar is aashay kaa koi prastaav bhejti he to ve pradhanmantri ke samaksh ise uthaane ko taiyaar hai
 According to Jain, now this myth should be broken that only dacoits are born in Chambal
 yah kshetra desh kaa hriday sthal he or ab aisa sandesh puure desh main janaa chahie ki chambal se vikaas kii nai dhara niklegi, lekin iske liye jo yojanaayen or audyogic prastaav banaae gaye hai, unhen hakeekat main tabdeel karne kii jarurat he
 The mantle of education success: Bollywood actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who won the National Award for his four films of 2012, asked him to rely on his own talent to make the big dreams of small town youth come true
 paan singh tomars film main dakait kaa role adaa karne vaale navazuddin ne chambal ke bihadon ke sansmaran sunaae or unhone yahaan ke yuvaaon ko sandesh diya ki ve shiksha kaa daaman jarur thame rakhen
 Education is one such path, which leads to hard work and it gives success
 navazuddin ne apni misaal pesh kii or kaha ki unhen kai baar riject kiya gaya, lekin ve date rahe or ab jaakar unki pratibha ko sammaan mila
 His education has contributed greatly to this success
 itm uniwarsity ke kuladhipati ramashankar singh ne kaha, “aparaadh aarthik or saamaajik visangatiyon ke panpate hai, lekin shiksha hi vah hathiyaar he, jo yah asamanta dur kar sakati he
 This is the reason why more than 4,000 students of Chambal region along with the entire country are getting educated in the ITM University, changing the identity of the world famous companies here
 ” chambal main dakaiton kaa safaya main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale ipies adhikari sanjay jha ne kaha ki chambal kii mitti or pani logon main junun paidaa karti he or isi vajah se ve jo thaan lete hai, ve karke dikhaate hai
 One of the reasons for the dacoits to flourish was that the directionless youths became insurgent with weapons
 ab anchal main shiksha or rojgaar ke saadhan viksit ho rahe hai or ummid he ki yuva baagi nahin balki desh ke vikaas main yogadan denge
 The audience present at the summit questioned the speakers directly, and this consensus was seen in the rugged Chambal, which has been notorious for dacoits for decades, is now ready to take off and is now needed to give a new direction to the youth and to build the infrastructure
 Of
 iske baad yahaan se jo vikaas kii dhara niklegi, vah desh kii tarakkee main vishesh yogadan karegi

 It also contains highly confidential information such as 'when was the last time sex' and 'which contraceptive method was used'
 Buzzfeed news ke mutabik ye jaankaree fasebuk ko bheji gai hai or target aids ke liye upyog main laai gayi hai
 Two apps that have been named include Maya and MIA Fem
 Maya ko google play or ap store se 5 million se bhi zyada baar downlod kiya gaya tha

 In the era of credit, debit cards and net banking, a carrier billing is emerging as a new option for your shopping payments
 idia bani pehali companikarier billing kisi bhi mobile graahak ko online digital content kharidne ke liye mobile oparator kii di hui suvidha he
 In this, payment can also be made to the prepaid or post paid bill of the mobile company for purchasing digital content
 telecom company edia cellular google play store se kharidari ke liye karier billing kaa vikalp dene vaali pehali company ban gai he
 Under this, any Idea customer can buy apps, games or software, by making purchases through Google Play Store by paying from their Idea account
 jahaan preeped graahak ke liye bhugtan kaa paisa uske preeped balance main se katkar kiya jaataa he to postped graahak ke liye ye paisa uske masik bill main judakar aata he
 That is, without any credit, debit card or netbanking facility, the customer can buy digital content such as apps, games or software from Google Play Store
 is suvidha ke peeche tark ye he kii mobile phone kisi bhi card yaa net banking se kai guna zyada graahakon ke paas hota he or isliye bhugtan kaa ek majboot vikalp ban saktaa he
 Credit cards are not fully available, but at the moment, the same services like software can be purchased from this facility, which can also be used on the phone
 lekin yah puri tarah credit card kaa kaam nahin karti
 That is, you will not be able to use it in online shopping at the moment
 lekin idia ke sioo lakshminarayan kaa maananaa aane vaale samay main ye mumkin ho saktaa he, basharte isamen koi regulatory dikkatein na rahen or iskaa puraa khaakaa yaa echosystem bhi taiyaar ho jaae
 At the moment you cannot buy things or services through carrier billing that you cannot use on the phone
 yani aapke phone acount ke credit card banane kii shuruyaat to ho gai he lekin ise aapke credit card kii jagah lene main philhal vakt lagegaa
 How fast this change will happen will depend on customers, government and telecom companies and online companies

 Police arrested Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya from the JNU campus in the same case
 gyaat ho ki do din pehle somvaar ko hoicourt ne ukt maamle main apana faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 On the last hearing, the Delhi Police, while registering a protest on Kanhaiya's bail, argued that Kanhaiya is not seen shouting slogans in the video, but he has witnesses in front of whom Kanhaiya had raised slogans
 police ne yah daleel hoicourt dwaara puche gaye sawaal ke baad di thi, jisamen hoicourt ne poocha tha ki kya unke paas sisitivi yaa anya koi saboot he, jisase sabit ho ki kanhaiya narebaaji kar rahaa tha? vahiin, kanhaiya ke vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha tha ki kanhaiya vahaan par hui ladaai ko sulajhavane gaya tha or usne desh-virdohi naare nahin lagaae
 During the hearing in the said case, the High Court had asked the police how Kanhaiya Kumar was responsible for the sloganeering when the outside students allegedly shouted slogans after coming to JNU? The police had argued that Kanhaiya was involved in the February 9 program and raised slogans
 police ne kaha tha ki unke paas swatantra gavaah hai, jinamein jeenyu adhikari, chif security adhikari va kuch chaatr shaamil hai
 However, the police had also admitted that Kanhaiya was not seen shouting slogans in the video
 police ne kaha tha ki jahaan yah kaarykram hua tha, vahaan koi sisisitivi nahin tha
 Due to bail on this stage, the wrong message will be sent
 jeenyu ke baad isi tarah ke naare jadhavpur vivi main bhi lagaae gaye hai
 At the same time, some people had made the video, in which Kanhaiya is present on the spot
 is par court ne poocha tha ki jab police ke paas saboot the to unhone pehle video tivi channel par chalane kaa intjaar kyon kiya
 
 
 Why not take action on your own? Comments gyaat ho ki pichhali sunwaayee par kanhaiya ke vakil ne kaha tha ki kanhaiya ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he

 It was also said that Kanhaiya cannot be held responsible for anti-national posters

 Shivsenraut said she can walkout during voting- Patriotism certificate is not required
 There is a news of relief for the Narendra Modi government on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki bill par voting ke dauraan shivasena rajyasabha se walk out kar sakati he
 The Shiv Sena MP, while appearing in the Rajya Sabha, gave some similar signs
 sarkaar par hamalaa karte hue shivasena saansad sanjay raut ne kaha ki hamen rashtrawaad par kisi kii certificate nahin chahie, unhone kaha ki jis skool main aap padhaate ho, ham us skool ke headmaster hai
 Shiv Sena can walk out, according to the sources, during the voting in the state, Shiv Sena can show its opposition by performing and can walk out of the House
 yaa phir voting ke dauraan sadan main maujuud rahane ke baavjood voting main shirkat nahin kar sakati he
 The Shiv Sena has already said that they can oppose the bill if the government does not remove their doubts on the citizenship bill
 lekin ab aisa lag rahaa he ki shivasena ne voting ke dauraan walk out kar sakati he yaa phir voting main shirkat nahin kar sakati he
 Read: The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 should not be hotly contested in the Rajya Sabha
 Evidence of patriotism, Rautne questioned the bill and said that we have hope from a strong PM and Home Minister
 kya is bill ke paas hone ke baad aap ghuspaithiyon ko baahar karenge, agar aap sharnaarthiyon ko sweekaar karte hai to us par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie, kya unako voting kaa adhikaar milegaa
 Strongly criticizing the BJP, he said that i have been hearing since yesterday that those who do not support this bill are anti national and those who support it are nationalists
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki shivasena ko deshbhakti kaa aisa certificate kisi se nahin chahie

 com / wjzttdgftx — ANI (@ANI) October 26, 2018 Paswan is being said that he does not want to contest the Lok Sabha elections due to ill health
 iske badale ve rajyasabha main janaa pasand karenge
 For this, there is a possibility that his party will back out of the demand for 7 seats and the seats on which BJP talks, both parties should agree on that
 haalanki iske bare main jab tak koi aadhikarik ghoshnaa saamne na aae, tab tak ise kayaas hi mana ja rahaa he
 After the seat sharing was announced, LJP leader Chirag Paswan made a statement with great caution and said that his party is engaged in further strengthening the NDA alliance
 haalanki baad main kai algepi netaa shah or nitish ke seat shering formule se naaraaz dikhe or jediu ko die ja rahe 'vajan' par ishaare main naaraazgi jaahir kii
 Sources are quoting that the LJP may be given 6 seats, while Paswan's party does not appear to be ready on less than 7
 paswan ke liye rajyasabha kaa daanvsutron kii maane to agar upendra kushavaah endie main rahete hai to bijepi ko 16 seat, jediu ko bhi 16 seat, algepi ko 5, araspi ko 2 or araspi se nilambit arun kumaar ko ek seat se chunaav ladaaya ja saktaa he
 The resentment of LJP and RLSP in the mathematics of these seats is evident as Bihar LJP President and Paswan's younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras has openly said that his party should not have less than 7 seats
 aise main 2 siton kii kami bijepi ke saath sambandhon main khatas laa sakati he lekin paswan ko rajyasabha se bhejne kii ranneeti aage isamen daanv par lag sakati he
 On the other hand, Upendra Kushwaha's resentment has been a topic of discussion for a long time
 ve kaaphi pehle se bijepi par seat shering ko lekar dabaav bana rahe hai
 After meeting Tejashwi Yadav on Friday, it is believed that Kushwaha's party will not be in RLSP NDA
 aise main siton kaa ganit idhar-udhar ho saktaa he
 According to sources, in such a situation BJP 17, JDU also 17, LJP 5 and Arun Kumar can contest on one seat
 assam se rajyasabha jaaenge paswankaha ja rahaa he ki bihar se aath baar saansad rahe or algepi ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main hajipur se chunaav nahin ladenge
 According to sources, the BJP may send Ram Vilas Paswan to the Rajya Sabha from Assam in April 2019
 paswan agar chunaav nahin ladate hai or bijepi unhen rajyasabha se sansad main bhejti he to bihar main endie kii seat shering ye hogi-bijepi 17, jediu ko bhi 17 seat, algepi 5 (salempur yaa devaria main se ek seat kii maang) or araspi se nilambit arun kumaar ko jahanabad se ek seat
