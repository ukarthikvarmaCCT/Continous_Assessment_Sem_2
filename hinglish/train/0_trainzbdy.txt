 unhone patr main apane istife kii vajah bhi bataai he
 Yadav said, 'one person's desire is reflected in the big decisions of the party
 jab uskaa dimag badalata he to party apane kadam badal detii he
 Being close to the leader is the basis of organizational roles and responsibilities
 ' unhone kaha, 'jab sabhi faislon or safaltaaon kaa shrey ek vyakti ko diya jaataa he to sabhi aarope bhi ek hi vyakti par jaaenge
 Yadav said, 'there is no doubt that Arvind Bhai is the undisputed leader in the party

 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki janaganana main yadi jati ko shaamil karnaa he to iske liye ek alag kollam hona chahie taaki isamen saaf taur par jati likhi ja sake
 Sources say that it should be desirable to the Sangh Parivar, which till now has been opposed to the inclusion of caste in the census as it is against the nationalist ideology of a united nation

 dakshin africa ke daure par pahunche america raashtrapati baraak obama ne shanivaar ko rangabhed virdohi andolan ke agua dakshin africa ke purv raashtrapati nelson mandela ke parivaar waalon se mulaakaat kii
 Mandela is hospitalized these days
 is bich obama ke dakshin africa daure kaa virodh kar rahe saikadon logon par police ne achet karne vaale hathgole chode
 According to the news agency, Obama and Mandela's family met for about an hour at the 'nelson Mandela Memorial Center' in Johannesburg
 obama ke saath is baithak main unki patni mishael obama bhi thim, lekin unke saath mandela ke parivaar ke kin sadasyon ne mulaakaat kii, is bare main pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Earlier, Obama had said that he would not go to the hospital to meet Mandela
 raashtrapati karyaalay dwaara jari vaktavy main kaha gaya he ki obama kaa yah nirnay mandela ke sheeghra swasth hone kii kamne ke chalate liya gaya he
 Obama also said that he did not want to obstruct the health improvement of hospitalized Mandela
 obama ne mandela ko apana vyaktigat preranarot bataaya or kaha, 'hamaare vichaar mandela, unke parivaar evam puure dakshin africa ke saath hai
 Obama called Mandela one of the greatest people in history
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli se kareeb 200 kimi dur yamuna nadi ke kinare aabaad agra bhale hi sadiyon purana shahar he, lekindesh main shaharikarantej hone ke saath hi yah shahar apni hadon ko laangh rahaa he
 Once on the way to the city from the Yamuna Expressway, it seems that the city has enough land to spread but due to skyrocketing land prices, multi-storey buildings are emerging on the horizon of new areas of this old city
 shahar ke is vertical growth ke bare main pushpanjali hospital and research centre or pushpanjali construction pra

 "there are many reasons for this," says Agarwal
 ek to bhoomi adhigrahan aasaan nahin he
 Second, there is lack of land
 isaki vajah se pichley teen-chaar saal main jameen bahut mahangi ho gai he
 Above all, every person wants to live in the city, wants to take advantage of the amenities there
 ‚Äù jameen kii kami kii vajah se bahumanjila rihaishi or vyavsaayik imaaraton kaa chalan chal padaa he
 But there is still no significant change in the construction rules in the city
 bahumanjili imaaraton ke nirmaan ke liye kai tarah kii sharton kaa paalan karnaa padataa he, jisamen fire brigade samet koi darjanabhar vibhaagon se manjuuri leni padati he
 The fire department in Agra has no arrangement to extinguish the fire in buildings above five floors
 agra ke varisht police adheekshak subhash dube kaa kahana he, ''nagar main fire hydrant na ke baraabar rah gaye hai jiske kaaran agnishman vibhaag kii damakalon ko kai ghatnaon ke samay pani kii killat kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 However, like other cities, there is a provision of floor area ratio (FAR) here
 is vajah se zyaadaatar rihaishi imaaraten paanch manzil se upar nahin pahunch paatin
 Agra's major commercial center Sanjay Place has eight storey buildings
 lekin fatehabad road par agra vikaas praadhikaran (edie) ne edie hits or pushpanjali constrections ne pushpanjali hits banaakar maano shahar main imaaraton kii oonchai kaa nayaa maanak taiyaar kar diya he
 The height of buildings in both these places is 14 floors
 jahaan edie hits agra ke sabase zyada mahange ilaakon main shumaar fatehabad road par sthit he, vahiin pushpanjali hits shahar kii seemaa par sthit dayalbag main yamuna ke kinare bani he
 ADA Secretary Ravindra Gupta says, "the specialty of ADA Heights is that the windows here have the crown of the world famous building Taj Mahal, due to which all the apartments built here were sold out
 yahaan tak ki sabase upar bane do paintahouse bhi pehle din hi book ho gaye
 However, some people who book flats in it say that not all windows show Taj Mahal
 gauratlab he ki ye oonchi imaaraten shahar ke bahari ilaakon main ban rahi hai
 Many builders in Agra are working on their project to capitalize on this desire to build a shelter away from the city's tumult
 edie ke alaava ansal or jepi group jaise bade naam shaamil hai
 Some of these builders are inhabiting townships
 nalanda group ke diarector santosh kataara kaa kahana he, ''agra main bahumanjila imaaraten banane kii yojana banaai thi lekin yahaan vaayu sena adda hone ke kaaran kaaphi bandishen hai isliye aath-manjila imaaraton‚Äînalanda crown or nalanda hits par hi is samay kaam chal rahaa he
 ‚Äúit is worth noting that a tall building cannot be constructed within a radius of two miles from the airport
 vaise, is group ne agra se sirf 60 kimi duuri par sthit vrundavan main sanskaar city naam se 14 manjila imaaraton kaa township basaaya he
 The ADA, the agency responsible for city development, has raised the height standard of buildings in Agra further
 vah ab mathura road par shastripuram hits ke nirmaan kii yojana bana rahaa he
 It will have 17 storey buildings
 agra main adhiktar bahumanjili imaaraten yaa to fatehabad or shamsabad maarg ke trikoniya ilaake main sthit hai, yaa phir dayalbag or agra-mathura rajmarg par bani hai
 New construction is taking place in all these areas and due to the high price of the land, the builders are giving more emphasis on multi-storey buildings
 in bulandiyon ke saath judaa dukhad pahalu yah he ki shahar main buniyadi sanrachana or sansadhano kii kami he
 Social worker Vishal Sharma says, "the level of ground water is going below one meter every year, and till now there is no adequate water supply in the city
 ‚Äù nai imaaraton main bijli ke taar or fittings kaa theka lene vaale jain electricals ke kishor jain kaa kahana he, ''in imaaraton main zyaadaatar niveshak hi booking kara rahe hai
 ‚Äúthe main reason for this is to have all the facilities available in one place
 jahaan puraane shahar main vaahan parking bhi ek samasya he, in sabhi imaaraton main under-ground parking kii vyavastha he
 People also prefer to live in multi-storeyed buildings in terms of security and maintenance costs are also coming down due to living in an integrated building
 saath hi bijli, pani, cabel tivi aadi sabhi suvidhaon ke sammilit rup se lene ke kaaran ye sasti pad rahi hai
 The city's upper-class people are also slowly moving out of the big luxurious rooms and going to these buildings for safety
 manish prakaashan ke maalik murarilal agarwal shahar ke posh ilaake vijaynagar kii aaleeshaan kothi main rahete the
 But now they are living in HIG apartment of Ashirwad Residency
 unke anusaar, ''yahaan suraksha or acha vaataavaran he
 ‚Äúthe height of buildings is not new to Agra
 lekin ab jameen kii killat or ek hi jagah par shahar kii sari sukh-suvidhaayen muhaiyaa hone kii vajah se duusare shaharon kii tarah agra kaa vertical growth tay he

 He is the leader of the dreaded terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba
 wo mumbai hamale kaa sabase bada gunahagaar he or wo sansad par hue hamale main jaish-e-mohammad kaa jodidar bhi he
 Hafiz Saeed, who killed hundreds of people, is saying that he should not be called a terrorist
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki hafiz said ne sanyukt raashtra main ek yachika daayar kar kaha he ki uskaa naam aatankwaadiyon kii list se hataa diya jaae
 The lie of Hafiz Saeed - Do not tell that terrorist, it also happens somewhere, who started a school of terror
 jisane shahar-shahar logon ko khun ke aansu rulaayaa ho
 Which killed hundreds of people
 jisane lashkar-e-tayba jaise sanghathan ko paidaa kiya ho
 Say the same, take my name out of the list of terrorists
 kyonki main aatankwaadi nahin hum
 Now what is a bigger lie than Hafiz Saeedka? internationali designated tebrist he hafizji haa
 This application is from the same Hafiz Saeed, who is an 'internationally Designated Terrorist'
 jiske sir par 10 million dollar kaa inaam he
 Who is the founder of a terrorist organization like lashkar-e-taiba
 jo hafiz said mumbai hamale kaa mastermind he
 Whose hands are stained with the blood of hundreds of innocents
 jo kashmir main 'teror' supplai karne vaala sabase bada saplir he
 Who has been under house arrest in his own country
 aatanki list se naam hataane kii arjivo khud ko sharif bataane kii jugat main laga he
 In India, this most wanted terrorist of jamaat-ud-dawa, Hafiz has applied to the United Nations not to be called a terrorist and his name should be removed from the list of terrorists
 iske liye usne united neshns main baqayada arji daayar kii he
 According to reports, this application on behalf of Hafiz has been filed by Mirza & Mirza, a law firm of Lahore, in U
N
 ye arji tabhi daayar kar di gai thi, jab hafiz said lahore main maujuud apane hi ghar main najarband tha
 Lahore's law firm appointed Yachikpakistan's National Accountability Bureau, former Prosecutor General Navid Rasul Mirza, has confirmed Hafiz Saeed's plea in the UN
 navid kaa betaa haidar rasul mirza hi yuan main hafiz kaa vakil he
 In Yachika filed there, Mirza & Mirza law firm of Lahore said "we are filing petitions on behalf of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed
" ham chaahate hai ki hafiz kaa naam iesas or al kaayda se jude dhadon kii list se hataa diya jaae
 This list has been prepared by the UN Security Council and the Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee
 "sanyukt raashtra ne hi ghoshit kiya tha aatankiapako bataa den ki jis sanyukt raashtra ke saamne hafiz said ne khud ko aatanki kahe jane par aitaraaz jataayaa he
 He himself was declared a terrorist 9 years ago in December 2008
 jabaki america ne to mumbai hamalon se pehle hi use global terrarist bataa diya tha or uske sir par 10 million dollar kaa inaam rakh diya tha
 He was also kept under house arrest under the Anti Terrorism Act in his own country for 11 months
 haa, ye baat alag he ki sarkaar kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se court ne use pichley hafte hi reeha kar diya
 It is meaningless that the question of Hafiz is now, what is the meaning of the petition given by Hafiz Saeed in the UN? In 2008, when Hafiz was declared a terrorist under Security Council resolution number 1267, China agreed
 aise main china, pakistan kii yaa hafiz said kii madad kar sakegaa aisa mumkin nahin he
 Apart from this, Hafiz has filed this application personally
 pakistan sarkaaraki taraf se philhal aisi koi arji daayar nahin kii gai he
 Therefore, Hafiz's efforts have no meaning
 america ne jataai naarazgiantararashtriya manch par aatankwaad ke khilaaf bharat majbootee ke saath apni baat rakh rahaa he
 The effect of this is that those countries of the world who used to consider the problem of terrorism as a mutual matter between India and Pakistan, are also now assuming that there are many faces of terrorists, which are destabilizing the world
 america pehle hi hafiz kii rihaai par pakistani sarkaar se etraz jataa chukaa he
 In such a situation, it does not seem that the famous casserole Mian Hafiz Saeed is trying to cook while sitting in Pakistan, she will never cook

 There are also some people in support of the Central Government on the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir
 log aashaa kar rahe hai ki kashmir main isse badlaav aayega or algaavvaadi apane mansoobey main fail honge
 However, in support of the central government, people are clearly refraining from saying anything
 logon ko dar he ki unke khulkar samarthan main aane se aatanki unhen nishaanaa bana sakate hai, isliye unki pahchaan gupt rakhi ja rahi he
 Ground Report 1: What are Kashmiris saying a month after the abrogation of Section 370? Two people of Gujjar Bakkarwal community were killed after being kidnapped
 aatankiyon ne ek dukandaar ko mahaj isliye goli maar di kyonki unhone hadtaal bulaai thi or aatankiyon ko yah baat raas nahin ai
 Everyone wants peace in Kashmir

 iske liye hamane lambii ladaai ladi
 Both the Center and the state ignored Sikhs in Kashmir
 hamane kabhi bhi pathar nahin phenke
 We did not talk of war against India
 ham ghati main hi ruke, lekin badale main hamen koi vishesh package nahin mila
 Today our youth struggle for jobs
 sarkaar ko shiksha or merit ke hisaab se naukari deni chahie
 Security personnel deployed in Baramulla and people gathered at shops are about 35 thousand people of Sikh community in Kashmir
 kai sikh yuvakon kaa kahana he ki unako yogyata ke anusaar naukari nahin mili, or jo mili he use ve karne ko majaboor hai
 They feel discriminated against
 ve rojgaar ke avasaron se inkaar karte hai
 Hoping to get the right now, an elderly Sikh from Srinagar said that we support the decision to abolish Article 370, because now we are with India
 ab hamen apana adhikaar milegaa
 The governments so far ignored it

 agar hamen lagata he ki faisla sahi he to ham unke khilaaf kaise bol sakate he
 i think appropriate steps have been taken and equal opportunities for all
 sthaneey kashmiriyon ko charchaa main shaamil karnaa chahie, pehle bhi yahi karnaa chahie tha
 The situation here remains sensitive
 dhara 370 ko khatm karne kaa samarthan karne vaali awaajen aakraamak samoohon se saavdhaan hai
 Right now, they have decided to remain calm, but they hope that the opportunities they were deprived of for a long time will now be found

 Jayant is the sitting MP from here
 hazaribagh main is baat kii charchaa he ki purv kendriya mantri yashavanth sinha ne kise vot diya hoga

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke openly on a number of issues in the 'bharat ki Baat Sabke Saath' program
 unhone bataaya ki unhen garibi kii sthiti kii jaankaree he, or iske liye kitaab padhane kii jarurat nahin
 At the 'bharat Ki Baat Sabke Saath' program from London's Central Hall Westminster, Modine said that i did not have to learn poverty by reading a book
 maine garibi tivi par dekhakar nahin siikhaa
 i have come here with great struggle
 modi ne kaha ki maine laal kile se kaha tha ki 18 hajaar gaanvon main bijli nahin pahunchi he
 This means that it has reached the rest of the villages, a hundred salutes to those who took it
 maine poocha ki kitne din lagenge, adhikariyon ne bataaya ki saat saal lagenge, maine kaha ki main itnaa intjaar nahin kar saktaa
 Now almost all the villages have access to electricity
 sau-dedh sau gaanv bache hai
 He said that Gandhi had said that if the scales are weighed, then see what the person sitting at the end is getting from it
 gandhi kii yah baat mere dimag main baith gai he
 Speaking on the incidents of rape, Modine said that the incident of rape with a girl child is very painful
 kya ham ye kahenge ki hamaari sarkaar ke samay main aisa hota tha, aapaki sarkaar main aisa kyon hota he
 i told the Red Fort that everyone asks daughters, sometimes ask sons too
 jo bete aisa kar rahe hai, unke gharon main bhi to maa-bahan hai
 This is a distortion of society
 khule main shouch ko lekar modi ne kaha ki mahilaayein suryoday se pehle yaa suryaast ke baad hi shauchalay jaati hai
 Until then, she is forced to endure physical pain
 ye baat mujhe sone nahin detii
 Today, 300 villages have become open defecation free
 ghar-ghar bijli pahunchane ke lakshya ko lekar unhone kaha ki maine pehle bidaa uthaaya ki gaanv main bijli pahunchaaungaa, phir gharon main pahunchaaungaa
 Out of a total of 25 crore families, there are 4 crore families who have no access to electricity, i will provide electricity to these houses also

 dilachasp baat yah he ki 2007 main bhi jab jokovich america open main up vijeta rahe, to unhone iske baad australian open kaa khitaab jeeta tha

 It was his first match at Grandslam
 srbian khilaadi ne kaha, ham lambey samay se ek-duusare ko jaanate hai or uske khilaaf khelnaa vastav main mushkil tha
 Hope you (murray) get the next chance to win a Grand Slam
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki aapke paas pratibha he or aap yah mukaam jarur hasil karoge
 Murray later stated that Djokovic played well and deserved the win
 unhone kaha, pichley saal kii tulana main meraa khel acha tha, lekin aaj novak ne avishwasaneey rup se behtareen khel kaa najaara pesh kiya
 This defeat is very disappointing, but you have to accept it

 Efforts to deal with the horrific situation have to be equally severe

 The Kejriwal government wants that one day even numbers in Delhi and odd number trains run the next day
 kuch logon ne is faisle kaa swaagat kiya he to kuch ne ise avyaavhaarik bataaya he
 At the moment, there has been debate about how correct this decision is and whether it will be implemented or not
 lekin is bahes ke neeche ek sawaal bhi dabaa he- dilli ko car chahie yaa sehat? haalanki iskaa faisla to dilli ko hi karnaa he, lekin kisi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle kuch aankadon par gaur karnaa bhi jaruri he
 The Clean Air Quality Index of Delhi gives the air quality from four areas of Delhi

 That is, the biggest reason for pollution in Delhi today is vehicles
 dilli ke transport department kii report ke mutabik 1990 se 2007 tak gadiyon se hone vaala pradooshan 50 fisadi badha he
 But pollution was also reduced by 60% in one day, according to the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), Delhi had reduced pollution by 60% on Car Free Day

 However, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee report, the pollution was reduced by 45 percent in that one day
 
 
 
 Tossons can be worth taking Delhi If the number of vehicles plying on the roads of Delhi is halved and Car Free Day is taken as the basis, then it is certain that pollution can be reduced by about 30 percent in a day

 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki desh main rahane vaala har bhartiya hindu he
 It should not be associated with religion but from a lifestyle perspective
 bhagwat ne dilli sthit ambedkar international centre main 30 deshon ke 70 se adhik videshi patrakaron se vibhinn muddon par baatcheet main yah baat kahi
 Regarding talks with foreign journalists, the Sangh says that there are many misconceptions against the RSS in the country and the world
 isliye sangh is koshish main he ki duniya bhar ke log sahi arthon main sangh ko samajhen
 Dialogue is the only way for this
 aapas main baatcheet se hi ham ek duusare ko behatar tareeke se samaj sakate hai
 According to information received from the Sangh, foreign journalists from Bhagwat tried to understand the Sangh's opinion on issues related to mall lynching, Ayodhya, Kashmir, NRC, homosexuality
 mal linching ko ghrunit bataate hue bhagwat ne kaha ki sangh kisi bhi tarah ke hinsa ke khilaaf he
 If any volunteer of the Sangh is also involved in this abominable act then he should be punished according to the law
 kashmir ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke uttar main bhagwat ne kaha ki, sangh, ek desh or ek vidhaan kaa pakshdhar hameshaa se rahaa he
 Therefore, the union supports to neutralize Article 370
 ab aglaa sawaal yah he ki kashmir main sthiti jald se jald saamaanya ho
 The real question is that there should be confidence among the people that their questions should be resolved with a generous heart
 khaskar vahaan kii naagarikta ko lekar yaa vahaan kii jameen ko lekar unke man main jo ashanka he use dur kiya jaae
 Bhagwat had clear views about NRC
 unhone kaha ki vah enarasi ke samarthak hai
 It is just a way of marking its citizens
 duniyaan ke kisi bhi desh main yadi koi hindu visthapit hota he to uske liye sirf bharat hi ek desh he jahaan use aasraa milegaa
 Bhagwat also made it clear that the Sangh does not interfere in politics or government
 yah baat alag he ki sangh ke vichaardhaara ke bahut se log raajnneeti or sarkaar main hai
 But the union, government and political parties differ

 Kumkum Bhagya Written Update: There is a lot of uproar in Zee TV show 'kumkum Bhagya' these days
 diwali party main praachi or sanju ke rishte par log sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The previous episode of 'kumkum Bhagya' showed Alia not allowing Prachi (mugdha Chapekar) to speak at the party
 aalia, praachi kii maa yani pragna (sriti Jha) ko bhi phone karti he, uski beijjati karne ke liye
 Aaliya starts worrying Riya as she likes Prachi's mother
 lekin pragna, aalia ke phone ko nahin uthaati kyonki vah car main purab ko rota dekh usase milane chali jaati he
 Karan Johar did a scuffle between Akshay Kumar and Rohit Shetty, so Karan Johar did in the previous episode of Kumaarasriti Jha and Shabbir Ahluwalia's show 'kumkum Bhagya' that Shahana, looking for Abhi She goes, so that she can save Prachi
 duusari ore abhi, ruthik ke saath hota he
 However, Hrithik leaves as soon as he realizes that the direction is gone
 punjabi 'katrina caff' shahanaz gil ke dance kaa soshal media par dhamal, baar-baar dekhe ja rahe ye viral videosiriyala 'kumkum bhagya (kumkum Bhagya)' ke apakaming episod main dikhaaya jayega ki praachi (mugdha Chapekar) or sanju, abhi ke saamne khadey honge
 Right now, she will ask Prachi if she can identify the waiter who mixed her drink
 praachi or sanju donon hi kahenge ki vah waiter ko pahchaan sakate hai
 Will just say that once the waiter is found, it will be known who tried to trap Prachi
 duusari ore riya or priyanka ye sunakar dar jaaengi
 Now it has to be seen whether Riya will know the truth now? agle vitt varsh kaa aam bajet pesh karne se pehle sarkaar vaishvik or gharelu aarthik chunautiyon ke bich bhartiya arthvyavastha ke swasthya par guuruuvaar ko sansad main vashirk report prastut karegi
 The Economic Review of 2011-12 presented by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee detailed the growing fiscal deficit, slowing economic growth and a difficult situation on the export front, as well as balancing the current macroeconomic environment
 Possible measures to accelerate economic growth may also be mentioned

 In the current financial year, oil and fertilizer subsidies have gone well above the budget estimate due to surge in crude oil prices
 aarthik narmi kaa kar rajasav par bhi prabhaav padaa he jisase rajkoshiya ghaataa anumaan se upar ja saktaa he
 Economic growth in the current financial year is estimated to be around 7 percent as compared to the previous year's GDP growth of 8

 FICCI says the fiscal deficit of 2011-12 is 5% of GDP
 6 se 5
 7 percent while it can go up to 4

 Limiting the fiscal deficit will be a major challenge for the Finance Minister

 Imran Khan, who has been an opponent of difa-e-pakistan, said that the Pakistan government had banned the terrorist organization JUD and provided any kind of financial, political or social support to it, as a crime
 mukhyamantri parvej khatak kaa aatanki makki ke saath manch saajha karnaa isliye bhi chaunkaane vaala maamla he, kyonki khatak imran khan kii party 'pakistan taharik-e-insaaf' (pitiai) se aate hai or imran khan hameshaa se dipha-e-pakistan council kii aalochana karte rahe hai

 ram mandir andolan ke dauraan kattar hinduvadi netaa kii chhavi bana chuki bharti ne bhi kaarysmiti kii baithak main bundelkhand ke vikaas kaa hi mudda uthaaya
 Uma Bharti's strategy is now to pursue such issues in Uttar Pradesh in which all sections of society are connected
 iske liye nadiyon kii badahaali jaise bhaavnaatmak muddon ko cash karne kii baat he
 In the meeting of the State Working Committee, Bharti put forward a step in this direction by making a proposal to make the holy river Mandakini of Bundelkhand pollution free

 By giving representatives of this class a place in the party organization, the BJP has made a strategy to bring businessmen along
 yahi vajah he ki vaisya birdari se jude rakesh kumaar jain or rajesh agarwal ko pradesh kaarysmiti main kramash: sanghathan mantri or koshadhyaksh jaisi mahatvapurn jimmedaari di gai he
 The BJP, which is gearing up for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, has decided its issues but some challenges are still facing the party which will not be easy to overcome
 sabase badi chunauti pradesh main yuva raajnneeti ko lekar he

 The party is in dilemma
 vah chaahati he ki dakshinpanthi log modi main apana netaa dekhen to udaaravaadi log modi main vikaas purush dekhen
 But the party has no idiom for how to understand these two things together

 Now films are being made about the background of non-metro cities
 cricket or shooting sareekhe khelon main‚Äîjo pehle zyaadaatar public skulon ke hi bacchon kii shirkat kii vajah se kuleen maane jate the‚Äîab chote shaharon ke ladakon or ladakiyon kaa dabadabaa he
 a large part of the workforce of the service industry is coming from among the residents of these hinterlands
 tajjub nahin kisexsrve kii tamaam 'gahamagahami' bhi un jagahon par dekhi ja rahi he jinhen haal hi tak chote shahar yaa kasbe mana jaataa tha or jo ab bade shahar or mahanagar banane ke kagaar par hai
 The perspective of relationships is changing
 to aakhir vah kya he jo chandigarh, pune, guwahati or indore sareekhe shaharon ke ladakon or ladakiyon ko aisi belgaum kamvasana se navaj rahaa he? lagata he ki gumnami hi vah sabase badi vajah he jo is kism kii kranti kaa sutarapaat kar rahi he
 The main reason for the silence of Pune or Indore was that everyone here knew everyone
 pichley dashak main in chote shaharon main nae jamaane ke kaarobaar, bank, kol centre, hotel or maalon kii bahaar aa gai or isaki vajah se inaki khuraaq par palane vaale or bhi chote kasbon kii badi aabaadi in chote shaharon main aakar bas gai he
 For example, a large proportion of those working at Indore's Crystal IT Park are towns like Ratlam, Khandwa, Khargone, Dewas and Dhar
 indore aate hi ye ladke or ladkiyaan mahaj chehre ho jate hai, taakazank karne vaale padosiyon tak ko unke bare main pataa nahin hota or unke irdagird parivaar bhi yaa to nahin hote yaa bahut kam hote hai
 As a result, the ethos of parochialism and stereotypes are left behind and sexual freedom is attained
 do dashak pehle indore main auraten bike kii pichhali seat par shaayad hi najar aati thim
 Today, the live-in relationship in the outlying residential areas of the city is no longer uncommon
 iske saath hi nae jamaane ke kaarobaaron ke ubharne kii vajah se aise shaharon main ucch shiksha ke nijee sansthaanon kii baadh aa gai he
 For example, there are around 100 engineering colleges in Indore as well as medical colleges, nursing colleges and colleges offering non-professional courses
 in collejon ke chaatro main bhi zyaadaatar baahar ke hi hai
 Anonymity gives them the freedom to adopt a lifestyle in which no inquiry is allowed
 in shaharon main aane vaale kai log, khaskar ladkiyaan, roodhiwaadee pariwaron se aate yaa aati hai
 The city in which they first come to study and then work, it also gives them the basis to thrive in a sexual sense
 haal ke dinon main banking or beemaa sareekhe kshetron main chantni kii ghatnaayen badi hai
 This insecurity at work places many people in the office more strongly towards sexual relationships with bosses or peers
 indore ke ek builder kehete hai, ''yuva peedi zyada tej raftaar jindagi jeena chaahati he or kam umr main marane se bhaybheet nahin he
 Raising experiences in life is very important and these include sexual experiences
 ''phir tajjub kya ki ausat ke rashtriya niyam ke peeche desh bhar main faile ve shahar chhipe hai jahaan yon lihaaj se sakriy sabase zyada safedposh kaarybal he
 44 per cent of the people surveyed in the country describe their sexual relationship with their partners as correct, but the survey says that this number is Pune (70% '), Indore (67%), Hyderabad (57%), Kochi (56%)
 ) And much higher in Chandigarh (55%), indicating acceptance of sexual relationships at workplaces in smaller towns than Banibasatan
 ye shahar jo kuch kar rahe hai, uske bare main khare bhi hai
 In Pune and Lucknow, 56 and 59 per cent of the respondents respectively said that they had offered sexual relationships to their partners
 yah 28 fisadi ke akhil bhartiya ausat se bahut zyada he
 As far as the people from whom these offers were made, Pune recorded 59 per cent incidents, much higher than the national average of 34 per cent
 kul 49 fisadi purushon ne jawaab diya ki unhen kaarysthal par afaire ke liye lubhaaya gaya tha, vahiin aisa sweekaar karne vaali mahilaon kii taadaad anumaan ke mutabik kahin kam 34 fisadi thi
 But this was not the case in cities across the country ‚Äî 69 percent of Hyderabad, 60 percent of Pune and 59 percent of Lucknow respondents said 'yes' to this question
 rashtriya str par 28 fisadi ne daawa kiya ki unhone apane saathi ke saath sex kiya, jabaki aisa sweekaar karne waalon kii taadaad pune main khaasi zyada 47 fisadi he or uske baad 46 fisadi ke saath chennai or lakhanu hai
 When it comes to sex with their subordinates, the number of people doing so in Lucknow is much higher than the national average
 is kism ke rishton ko sweekaar karne waalon kii taadaad lakhanu or pune main kramshah 48 fisadi or 44 fisadi he, jabaki akhil bhartiya str par 29 fisadi logon ne hi yah sweekaar kiya
 In Guwahati, 93 per cent of the respondents claimed that they had sex with their subordinates, while at the national level the number of women having such a relationship was 45 per cent and 56 per cent for men
 saathiyon ke saath sex ke khayali pilav pakaane waalon main hyderaabadi (72%) sabase aage maaloom dete hai, jo chennai (65%) or gurugram (59%) se zyada or 43 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat se to or bhi bahut zyada hai
 The residents of Pune were the most 'sexting' (55%) of those who sent sexual messages, while its national average was just 28%
 kis and tail yani yon batakahi saamaanya maaloom detii he
 Out of all those who were consulted at the national level, Adhas stated that he knew a man who had sexual relations with his fellow worker
 magar lakhanu main aisa kehane waalon kii taadaad phir zyada thi, jahaan 65 fisadi uttardaataaon ne daawa kiya ki haa, unhen maaloom tha
 The figures in Chandigarh were also similar
 dilli kaarysthal par yon utpeedan kii sabase zyada ghatnaon (59%) ke saath awwal number par he
 However small cities like Pune (55%), Lucknow (52%) and Guwahati (42%) are also not far behind
 chote shaharon main haalanki isaki vajah jaagrukta kii kami bhi ho sakati he ki yon utpeedan kya he
 "it is common for male colleagues to use abuse at the workplace, comment on female colleagues' clothes and embarrass them about their bodies," says a female employee working in a hotel in Indore
 ho saktaa he, unhen ehsaas na ho ki yah yon utpeeda he
 
 
 Or maybe they are shameless about it
 ''kaarysthal par sex mouj-masti ke alaava kariyar ke liye bhi chamatkaar karata jaan padataa he
 More than half (51%) of respondents nationally said that sex at the workplace had a good impact on their careers
 ahmedabad main 100 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki isse unke kariyar main oochaal aayaa, guwahati main 98 fisadi or lakhanu main 74 fisadi ne aisa hi daawa kiya
 In terms of productivity, 55 per cent of the people involved in the opinion poll said that sex had a good effect, while 26 per cent did not see any effect
 is maamle main bhi ahmedabad 100 fisadi manjuuri ke saath sabase awwal he
 Finding a suitable place for sex seems to be a major issue in Guwahati, where 86 percent of respondents said they had sex during office hours
 83 fisadi ne bataaya ki ve kam se kam ek aise shaks ko jaanate hai jo daftar main sex karte hue pakadaa gaya tha
 a similar number of respondents from Pune were also aware of such cases
 akhil bhartiya str par keval 43 fisadi logon ko aise maamalon kii jaankaree he
 During office hours, Guwahati appears to be the most open city for sex activities in another case
 yahaan ke 91 fisadi uttardaataaon ko yon rishte rakhane vaale saathiyon ke bare main echaar ko bataane main koi gurej nahin he, jabaki ahmedabad or ranchi main ek bhi uttardaata aisi jaankaree saajha karnaa nahin chahta
 Nationally, 29 percent of respondents were willing to tell HR about sexual activity at the workplace
 akhil bhartiya str par 51 fisadi uttardaataaon ne kaha ki unhone ek hi saathi ke saath sex kiya
 In Patna, 92 percent of the respondents claimed sex with the same partner
 iske ulat ahmedabad main 43 fisadi uttardaataaon ne teen partneron ke saath sex kaa daawa kiya
 Under the cover, India seems to gain victory over India
 *** The good news for the capitalists fond of dropping firecrackers on Deepawali is that the Supreme Court has lifted the complete ban on firecrackers
 supreme court ne purna pratibandh ke apane hi purv aadesh ko palatate hue pataakhon kii bikri kii ijaajat to de di he, lekin kai sharten bhi laga di hai
 The Supreme Court laid down these conditions, gave these instructions: - The license to be given for the sale of firecrackers in Delhi should be halved and a maximum of 500 licenses should be issued
 2016 main jari license ke mukaable is baar sankhya aadhi hogi
 This means that firecrackers will only be sold at 500 stores
 - yahi niyam ensiaar ke liye bhi lagu honge
 That is, the number of licenses for NCR will be half as compared to 2016
 - silent jone ke 100 meter ke bheetar koi pataakhen nahi chode jaaen
 That is, there will be a silence zone of 100 meters around the hospital, court, religious place and school
 - pataakhe banane main lithium, lead, mercury, antimoni va arsenic kaa istemaal nahi hoga
 - Firecrackers will not be brought from other states in delhi-ncr until further orders, because there is already stock of firecrackers in delhi-ncr
 -dilli-ensiaar main maujuud 50 lakh kilogram pataakhon kaa stokagamee dashahra or deepawali ke liye paryaapt se kahin adhik hai
 Licensed shopkeepers can sell firecrackers left in the old stock or even supply in other states
 supreme court ne pataakhon ke license par lagi roak hataate hue yah bhi saaf kar diya ki deepawali ke baad air quality ko lekar court sunwaayee karegaa

 In the call drop case, the mobile service provider companies have stated in the Supreme Court that mobile companies are not responsible for the call drop
 kol drops hone ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 These include cases such as mobile phones used by consumers, distance from mobile towers and tunnels or jammed areas or cable disconnection of mobile companies
 ye maamla bijli kii tarah nahin balki radio wave par aadhaarit he
 The comments companiyon kii ore se kaha gaya ki duniya main aisa koi desh nahin jahaan kol drops na hoti ho
 Colombia is the only country where call drops are fined
 duniya main har jagah 2 se 5 fisadi kol drops kaa ausat mana jaataa he
 It is 2% in India
 jab 2 fisad sweekaarya he to ham par ye jurmaana kyon lagaaya ja rahaa he

 Despite the warnings of Uttar Pradesh BJP President Mahendra Nath Pandey, bjp's ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party leader and minister in the Yogi government, Om Prakash Rajbhar's rebellion has not stopped
 ve lagaataar aise bayaan de rahe hai, jisase lagata he ki soobe main party do guton main banty hui he
 Rajbhar takes a dig at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and studies in the grace of Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya upi bijepi main sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa he?kairana or nurpur chunaav main bijepi kii haar par ravivaar ko rajbhar ne kaha, 'kisi bhi haar kii jimmedaari hameshaa raja kii hoti he
 The 2017 assembly election was fought under the leadership of Keshav Prasad Maurya
 us dauraan saini, kushvaha, maurya samet tamaam pichhadi jatiyon main keshav prasad maury ko siem banane ke liye bijepi ko vot kiya, lekin siem yogi ban gaye, jiske kaaran sarkaar ko pichhadon kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 'rajbhar has not made such a statement for the first time
 ve pichley 6 maheene se lagaataar siem yogi ke khilaaf tippanee kar rahe hai
 Not only this, he has also questioned the working style of PM Modi
 sahyogi dal ke netaa ke is tarah ke bayanon par na to bijepi kii ore se koi karrwai hoti he or na hin keshav maury ne ab tak koi tippanee kii he
 While Rajbhar is constantly making statements in favor of Keshav and questioning Yogi
 pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya ne pichley maheene rajbhar ke lagaataar party ke khilaaf kii ja rahi bayaanbaji par chetate hue tha ki vah roj-roj anargal bayaanbaji na karen nahin to majabuuran unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Even on this warning, they did not hawk and said that those who have to take action, they are not afraid of action
 unhen karrwai karne se koun roak rahaa he
 Let me tell you that BJP Om Prakash Rajbharki Party had contested UP assembly elections in alliance with Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party
 rajbhar ko 8 vidhansabha siten di gai thi, jisamen se unke 3 vidhayak jeetne main safal rahe the
 After this, the government was formed under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, Rajbhar was awarded the post of cabinet minister
 iske baavjood ve yogi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karne se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 During the Rajya Sabha election, BJP President Amit Shah called Rajbhar to Delhi and met him
 iske baavjood chunaav main rajbhar kii party ke ek vidhayak ne cross voting kii
 While manipulations were being held for one vote each
 iske baavjood unhone apane vidhayak par kisi tarah kii koi karrwai tak nahin kii or na hi us par koi tippanee kii
 In fact, Rajbhar remains a sore throat of the BJP, which the party cannot spill or swallow
 vipakshi dalon kii ekta ko dekhte hue bijepi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav tak kisi tarah kii karrwai se batch rahi he
 Rajbhar's party is based in the region of Ghazipur, Mau, Ballia and Banaras
 party un par shikanja kasakar unhen shahid nahin bananaa chaahati he
 But the way they are making trouble by making statements against the party and the government, they should not prove more harm than benefit
 uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri evam basapa supremon mayawati ne chunaav ayog se varanasi main narendra modi ke road sho par swat: sangyaan lene kii maang kii he
 He says that on the one hand there was a sixth phase of voting in the entire country and UP on Thursday, while the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi nominated the roadshow was wrong
 mayawati ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki kal jis dhang se narendra modi ke namakan or road sho ko lekar media ke jariye bhaajapa kii puure desh main ek tarafa hawa banaai gai vah uchit nahin tha
 The Election Commission should take suo motu cognizance of it
 unhone kaha ki varanasi main narendra modi kaa road sho janhit main nahin tha
 Strict measures should be taken against him
 mayawati ne kaha ki kal varanasi main narendra modi ke road sho ko lekar kaaphi galat prachaar prasar kiya gaya, jabaki vaastaviktaa yah he ki road sho main sthaneey kam bahari log zyada the
 He alleged that through the media, the BJP promoted Modi's roadshow in a big way, so that the BJP would get maximum benefit in the next phase of voting, especially in Purvanchal, when it will not happen
 mayawati ne yah bhi kaha ki charchaa yah bhi he ki media ke jariye bhaajapa, congress or sapa ne chunavi hawa banane ke liye puunjipatiyon or audyogic gharaanon dwaara kaaphi kharch kiya ja rahaa he
 Mayawati alleged that with the help of the capitalists in support of the BJP, an attempt is being made to create air through the media
 vipakshi dalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone aarope lagaaya ki agar ve satta main aae to apane madadgaar puunjipatiyon ke phaayde ke liye nitiyaan banaaenge, lihaaja logon ko bahut soch-samajhakar matdaan karnaa chahie, varanaa desh bahut pichad jayega
 The BSP president said that there is three-phase voting in the state and the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BJP can try to give it a hindu-muslim color
 unhone kaha, 'main chunaav ayog se aagrah karti hum ki vah naa sirf varanasi, balki purvanchal ke sabhi mandiron or masjidon kii suraksha par vishesh dhyaan den
 The responsibility of safeguarding these shrines should not be in the hands of the state police, but in the hands of the central forces
 agar varanasi main koi harakat hoti he to uskaa asar puure desh par padegaa
 ' mayawati ne kaha ki congress apane pradhanmantri pad ke aghoshit ummidavaar rahul gandhi ko, jabaki bhaajapa apane ghoshit pratyaashee modi ko saamne rakhkar chunaav lard rahi he

 in sab ke bich bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne jediu ke rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithkbulaai
 In which the party's National Vice President Prashant Kishor also attended
 bataa den ki nitish kumaar bihar main bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 The BJP hopes that it will clear Mamata Banerjee's leaf in the 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki maine pehle hi saaf kar diya he ki mamata banerjee ke saath kaam karne ko lekar prashanth kishor khud hi apni baat aapke saamne rakhenge
 JDU spokesman KC Tyagi said that JDU has nothing to do with I-PAC
 yah jediu kaa hissaa bhi nahin he
 Why were such questions not asked when Prashant Kishore was working in the Andhra Pradesh elections for Jaganmohan Reddy
 sutron ke anusaar rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se pehle nitish kumaar ne prashanth kishor ke saath kareeb ghante bhar kii baithak kii thi
 However, what happened between the two during this time is not yet clear
 lekin aisi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki prashanth kishor ko mamata banerjee ke liye kaam karne kii anumati de di he
 On the other hand, after the meeting, JDU Principal General Secretary KC Tyagi (KC Tyagi) said that in the media, we dismiss the news of misunderstandings between the two parties
 is sarkaar ko hamaara baahar se samarthan jari rahegaa

 unhone kaha ki shapath samaaroh ke din bhi amit shah ne phone kiya tha
 We did not name anyone
 logon ke naamon se chalane vaali charchaaen galat hai
 Let us know that Bihar Chief Minister and JDU Chief Nitish Kumar (nitish Kumar) said a day ago that the issue of not giving cabinet to any leader of JDU at the Center (PM Modi) is over now
 unhone (nitish Kumar)kaha ki centre (PM Modi) main bijepi kii apni bahumat kii sarkaar he or sarkaar chalaane ke liye unako kisi sahyogi dal kii jarurat nahin he
 But if keeping the future in mind, the Central and Bihar governments are working together
 bihar main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar nitish kumaar ne kaha ki agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main jediu-bijepi saath milakar ladegi
 It would be wrong to raise any question on this
 nitish kumaar patna main ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 In the meantime, when reporters asked him if you had an opinion on not being included in the Union Cabinet, he said that the offer of inclusion of a minister on the basis of symbolic representation was meaningless
 uski koi aavashyaktaa nahin he 
 Nitish said that what has to happen happens in the beginning
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar chalaane kaa janadesh khud janata ne unako diya he, to usamen sahyogi dalon kii kya zarurat he

 - Do not allow black pictures in the house, because they give rise to negative energy
 puja ke liye aisi ho tasvirjyothish ke jaankaar maanate hai ki ghar main puja-upasna ke liye chitra lagane se pehle bhi kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 
 
 - Put a picture of the deity or your guru in the house for worship
 ye chitra jitne saafe or spasht honge, utana hi acha hoga
 - These pictures should be placed at the place of worship or work place, they should be at such a height that it can come in the eyes of our eyes
 - ek saath bahut saare chitra puja ke liye nahin lagane chahie
 If the color or shape of the picture deteriorates, it should be replaced
 naukari nahin mil rahi to ye upaay karenge madadchitr kaa chamatkaar- shayankaksh main apane vivaah ke samay kaa chitra lagaana chahie
 If you want, you can put a joint picture of husband and wife
 - mata-pita yaa bhai-bahan kaa chitra uttar kii ore lagaaein
 - If you want to put a picture of a dead person, then put it on the south wall
 - ghar ke dining aria main sanyukt parivaar kaa chitra laabhadaayak hota he
 Such will increase fortune - To increase love in the house, put a picture of flowers around the drawing room or the main door
 - aarthik sampannataa ke liye puja sthaan par baithi hui lakshmi ji kaa chitra lagaaein
 - To get children, put a lotus flower or a picture of a cow in the bedroom
 - achche swasthya ke liye kaam ke sthaan par ugte surya kaa chitra lagaaein
 For the destruction of all kinds of suffering, put a picture of Shiva or Krishna in the place of blessing at the place of worship
 ganesh pujan main nahin prayog hoti tulsi, jaaniye kyunchitr lagane kii saavdhaaniyaan- jahaan tak ho sake rangeen or sundar chitra lagaaein
 - Do not put pictures of wild animals, fire and thorns
 - chitron ko saafe rakhen
 Do not let them get dusty
 - puja ke sthaan par pati-patni or bacchon kaa chitra naa lagaaein
 - Do not put pictures of deities in the bedroom

 khel koi bhi ho, myne rakhti he to bas ek cheez Sportsman spirit
 This is the one thing that once you have learned, then nothing can stop you from winning in the field of life
 jaane aise 5 sabak jo sports hamen khel-khel main sikhaa detaa he
 1
 haar se siikhnaa:sports aapako sabase badi cheez jo sikhaata he wo he apni haar se siikhnaa, girakar dobaaraa ek nai urja ke saath uthanaa
 The game is passed by any player for his best shot, without worrying about what the result will be
 2
 Team Work Magic: Whatever the game is, how to work with the team and how to be a good team
 is baat ko bakhubi sikhaa detaa he
 You learn how to keep the atmosphere healthy with each other, which is useful in playing long innings in life
 3
 Giving ourselves a second chance: After making mistakes in life, we think that everything is finished now
 ham ye nahin sochate ki khud ko ek or mauka to dekar dekho, kya pataa nai raahen aapke intjaar main ho
 At the same time, sports learns from day one that always give themselves a second chance
 pehla shot kharaab hua to kya doosraa hit hoga
 4
 apni limit khud tay karnaa:aap kitne kaabil he aamtaur par ham dusron kii soch se tay kar lete hai
 Not only this, forgetting his abilities by considering him as a stone
 vahiin khel har roj aapako nayaa chalange detaa he or sikhaata he ki aapaki kshamta kitni he ye aap set karte hai or use har din badha sakate hai
 5
 haar main khud ko sanbhaalanaa:har din aapaki jeet ho aisa nahin ho saktaa he
 This skill teaches you how to move forward by accepting your defeat positively by accepting this truth

 The Karni Sena also demanded an inquiry into who wrote the slogans against the Padmaavati and against the Hindus? On the Supreme Court's reprimand for the film Padmavati, the Karni Sena has now directly sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention in the matter
 karani sena ne kaha ki ab is maamle main koi supreme court naa jaae keval karani sena supreme court jaaegi kyonki unke paas sabhi tarah ke saboot hai

 kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ke sitamarhi ko lekar die gaye bayaan se sitamarhi ke sant samaaj main aakrosh he
 The Sant Samaj asked the minister to apologize on his statement or else he warned of the consequences
 bihar ke sitamarhi main mata sita kii prakaty sthali he
 For centuries, it has been believed that when Janaka, the king of Mithila, plowed for the rain in a state of severe drought, Mata Sita was born from Punura land near Sitamarhi
 valmiki ramayana main bhi ye charchaa kii gai he ki mithila main mata sita kaa janm hua tha
 But the answer given by the Union Minister Mahesh Sharma in the Rajya Sabha has agitated the entire Sant Samaj
 samskruti mantri mahesh sharma ne rajyasabha main kaha ki sitamarhi bas aasthaa or vishwaas kaa centre he
 Archaeological Survey of India has not found any such evidence due to which Sitamarhi should be considered as the birthplace of Sita
 mahesh sharma madhya pradesh ke bijepi saansad prabhaat jha ke sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Prabhat Jha is a native of Sitamarhi
 kendriya mantri ke is bayaan se keval sitamarhi hi nahin balki nepal main sthit janakapur main kadi pratikriya hui he
 The Sant Samaris of Sitamarhi have warned of the movement
 unki maang he ki mantri apane bayaan ke liye maafee maangen
 For this, an emergency meeting of the Sant Samaj was held at Janaki temple in Sitamarhi on Friday
 baithak main shaamil santon ne mantri kii aadhyatmik jaankaree par prashn uthaate hue unki maansik sthiti par bhi sawaal khadaa kiya
 Temple priest Triloki Das said that there is evidence of the birth of Mother Sita in the Treta Yuga at Sitamarhi, when Sita was seated with a blood-filled pot of saints while plowing by King Janaka after a terrible drought for 12 years from the tyranny of the demons
 Appeared
 aise main sita ke janm par sawaal uthaane vaale mantri ji ram ko maanate hai sita ko nahin? iskaa sitamarhi kaa sant samaaj kadaa virodh karata he or mantri ji ko avilamb maafee maangani chahie, itnaa hi nahin naarad muni ke awahn par sita kii prakatya sthali kaa naam sitamarhi rakhaa gaya
 Its proof is also in mythological texts
 mahesh sharma bijepi ke saansad he
 His party considers Ayodhya as the birthplace of Ram, but the birthplace of Sita is being questioned
 haalanki ye sahi he ki ayodhya main shri ram kaa janm hua he iskaa pramaan puratv vibhaag ko mila he
 But what is the question of authenticity, if research has not been done at that level for the birthplace of Sita Mata
 rahi baat puranic granthon main to isaki charchaa jarur milti he
 And the biggest thing is if mother Sita is not born in Sitamarhi then what is the authenticity of Janakpur located in Nepal
 jabaki us samay ke mithila rajya main ganga se utar sthit bhubhag ko mithila kaa seemaa mana gaya he
 Also, there is a mention of the events of the Ramayana period in the areas along the river Saryu
 chaahe wo ahilya sthaan ho punaura dham haleshwar sthaan panth paakar dhanusha va janakapur ye sabhi sthaan ek duusare se jude hue hai
 It is mentioned in the mythological texts that with the call to make rain on the earth burning with drought, King Janak had plowed at some distance from Janakpur
 sitamarhi ke punoradham se janakapur kii duuri koi bahut zyada nahin he
 Every year on the occasion of Vivah Panchami, Ram's procession from Ayodhya goes to Janakpur
 to kya ye bina kisi pramaan ke ye aayojan sadiyon se chal rahaa he
 Among the scriptures in which Ram Ayodhya Janakpur and Lanka are mentioned, only Sita and her birthplace Mithila are mentioned
 unheen dharmagranthon se sitamarhi ko mata sita kii janmasthali mana he

 com / Pw0nepcu6s‚Äî Amit Shah (@amitshah) January 9, 2019 What did Rahul Gandhi say? Congress President Rahul Gandhi called Nirmala Sitharaman's statement on Rafael issue dissatisfied
 rahul ne kaha, "hamane janata kii adaalat main rafel saude par sawaal uthaaya
 We have asked Modi ji to clarify his stand on the Rafale issue and said that the Congress party will clarify its stand
 lekin, aapane dekha ki 56 inch ke seene kaa daawa karne vaale pradhanmantri ne sansad main kadam rakhane kaa saahas nahin dikhaaya
 "she said that Sitharaman gave a speech for two and a half hours but all her talk went in vain as she could not give even a satisfactory answer to a question
 rahul ne kaha, "pradhanmantri janata kii adaalat se bhaag gaye or kaha, 'sitaraman ji mujhe bachaao, main khud ko bhi nahin bachaa saktaa, aap hamen bachaao
 'but, she too could not save him in his two and a half hours speech
 " The Congress unit of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday alleged that the state administration deliberately reduced the security of its leaders and other members of the opposition to prevent them from reaching the public
 congress ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar main koi aadhikarik pad nahin rakhane vaale bhaajapa netaaon ko party ke purv mantriyon, saansadon or vidhayakon ke mukaable behatar suraksha or vaahan muhaiyaa karaae gaye hai
 In a statement issued by the Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC), "the Governor's administration is more in favor of the opposition leaders, especially senior Congress leaders, by reducing and facilitating the BJP leaders who are less politically under the policy
 Providing security and vehicles
 'bayaan main kaha gaya, ‚Äòyah jaanboojhkar kiya ja rahaa he taaki in netaaon ko janata se dur rakhaa ja sake
 The Congress said that even the security of JKPCC President GA Mir has been reduced
 party ne kaha, ‚Äòkashmir main adhiktar sheersh netaa apane gharon tak simit rah gaye hai or anyatra netaaon ko bhedbhaavpurn ravaiye ke jariye aisa karne ke liye majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress has asked the Center and the state administration not to engage in discriminatory and retaliatory action against the opposition
 'party ne kaha, ‚Äòshanti, sauhaard or kshetreey ekta kii virdohi takatein mukhyadhara or rashtravaadi shaktiyon ko raajnneetik or samjik gatividhiyon se dur rakhane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 By reducing security, leaders can become easy victims of anti-national and anti-social forces and at the same time will disrupt political activities which is necessary in creating a democratic environment to defeat enemies

 balaatkaar ke maamle main jail main band gurmeet ram rahim kii mushkil ab jaipur court ne bhi badha di he
 In Jaipur, the court has ordered a re-investigation in the case of the disappearance of Ramraheem from the ashram of a man's wife
 court ne kaha kiraam rahimake ashram main peedit kii patni ko khoja jaae or usko gaayab karne main jin logon ke haath hone kii ashanka he, unki jaanch kar police court ko ek maheene ke andar report saunpe
 Kamlesh's lawyer Babu Lal Bairwa gave this information
 peedit pati nekya kaha court sejaipur ke jagatpura ke kachi basti main rahane vaale kamalesh raigar police se guhaar laga rahe hai ki meri patni waapas dilava dijie
 My wife is imprisoned by Gurmeet Ram Rahim in her ashram in Sirsa
 apane do chote bacchon ko akele paal rahe kamalesh ne bataaya ki kachi basti ke bahut saare log deraa jate the, isliye wo bhi unke saath apane patni bacchon ko lekar gaye
 There was also our familiar Dutta, who kept us at one place
 agle din meri patni mere bachche ko chhodkar ek sevadaar ke saath nahaane gai, to dubaara lautakar nahin ai
 When we asked in the ashram, you said go back now, your wife is absorbed in Baba's attention
 jab uskaa dhyaan khatm hoga, to wo khud hi chali aegi
 Police is saying - where the missing has been lodged, after this he lodged with many people, but no one listened to them
 jab vah thane gaye, to jaipur police boli ki jahaan se patni gaayab hui, vahaan jaakar mukadmaa darj karwaao
 Then he met a lawyer, and through the Istagasa of the court, he filed a case at Jawahar Circle police station in Jaipur
 lekin police ne yah kahkar court main effaar laga di ki baba ke ashram main jaanch karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Baba has got z category protection
 magar kai tarah ke aapraadhik mukademe darj hai
 Devotees of Ram Rahim used to threaten to remain silent, during this time, the people of Ram Rahim near Kamlesh reached to threaten
 in logon ne kamalesh ko dhamkaaya ki yaa to paise le lo yaa phir munh band kar lo, nahin to jaan maar denge
 After this, the police also started to drive them away from the police station
 isse dar kar kamalesh ghar baith gaye or apane donon bacchon kii dekhbhaal karne lage, lekin ram rahim kii giraftaar ke baad inako dubaara ummid bandhi ki ab unki bivi waapas mil jaaegi
 In May 2015, the complaint was lodged in the court on 5 May 2015 that both he and his wife had gone to Ram Rahim's Sirsa Ashram with their children, but two days later, his wife was there
 Has been imprisoned court ne jaipur ke jawahar nagar thane ko mukadmaa darj kar unki patni ko pesh karne ko kaha tha
 An FIR was lodged against Ram Rahim at Jawahar Nagar police station on May 8, 2015, in which the police have not been able to investigate so far

 In Delhi, one such woman, Sunita Chaudhary, was still driving her auto in the midst of all the challenges
 lekin mangalvaar ko sunita ko us samay bada jhatka laga jab ek duusare auto chaalak ne sunita ko dindahaade jhansa dekar uski jivan bhar kii kamai ke 3 xxrep 4 0 rupee lut liye
 Delhi's first female auto driver Sunita Chaudhary had to sell her 15-year-old auto because autos that are more than 15 years old can no longer run in Delhi
 unhone purana auto bechakar or apni mehnat kii kamai se kisi tarah 30,000 rupee jutaaye
 Thought it would buy a new auto
 lekin mangalvaar ko jab 40 varshiya sunita choudhary meerut ke apane gaanv bada mevaana se lautate vakt gajiabad ke sahibabad ilaake se ek duusare auto main sawari kar apane ghar laut rahi thim to usee auto ke driver ne apane teen saathiyon ke saath milakar sunita choudhary kii ab tak kii bachat kii sari kamai yani ki 3 xxrep 4 0 rupee lut liye
 According to Sunita Chaudhary, "three people were sitting behind and a man was sitting in front with the driver
 achaanak usne jo apane saath aadmi baitha tha usko peeche bithaaya
 i asked why he did this, so he said that if someone is seated in front, it gets invoiced, so now four people will sit back
 phir kuch der baad usne auto roak diya or kaha ki auto kharaab ho gaya he jabaki maine dekha or kaha ki nahin auto to thik he
 But he said no it is spoiled, you look at the other auto
 is dauraan unhone meraa saamaan neeche utaar diya or jab main duusare auto ko dekhne lagi isi dauraan vah bhaagane laga
 i got suspicious and saw that my 3 xxrep 4 0 rupees were missing from my bag
 'tees hajaar rupee kya chori hue sunita par to jaise museebaton kaa pahaad tut padaa
 Sold the old auto, all the money was gone

 Sunita is now forced to drive a rental auto
 sunita choudhary ne kaha 'mere paas ab koi vikalp nahin he
 You can only request someone and there is no choice that you give me a car on rent, give me an auto fare, then i drive

 sunita choudhary ne kaha 'kehete hai na ki bure vakt main madad karne vaale bahut kam log hote hai
 'sunita Chaudhary is also happy and is also happy that a leader has come forward and helped him, otherwise someone would have been able to help

 The bodies of a man and a girl were included
 police ne shav nikaal liye or unki shinaakht ke prayaas shuru kiye
 In the morning, it was reported from the cross-section of Jamuna that the dead bodies belonged to 54-year-old Gopal's son Ninua and his daughter
 isaki pushti sadi-gali laash se mili aadhaar card se ho bhi gai
 After this, Gopala's elder daughter who reached the police station has also confirmed this

 It is also believed that Salman will not sing any song from favorite Pakistani singer in his ambitious project 'bharat'
 mana jaataa he ki aatif or raahat fateh ali khan, salmaan ke pasandida singer hai
 Both singers have sung for him in Salman's previous films
 pakistani singer se gaanaa gavaane ke liye salmaan kai baar aalochana bhi jhel chuke hai
 Singers like Abhijeet and Sonu Nigam have also criticized Dabangg Khan for this many times without naming him
 lekin ab pulavama kii ghatana ke baad bharat main yah sambhav nahin ki koi pakistani singer salmaan ke liye haal philhal gaanaa gaae
 By the way, there is no concrete information about whether a Pakistani singer has any song in India

 Praising Sachin Tendulkar for his long stint in cricket, Australian captain Michael Clarke said it was the all-time great batsman after Indian legend 'incomparable' Don Bradman
 tendulkar bharat or west indies ke bich mumbai main khele ja rahe duusare test match ke baad sanyas le lenge
 It is also his 200th Test match
 pichley 24 saal se antarrashtriya cricket main khel rahe tendulkar kaa gungan karte hue clark ne kaha ki unhen vastav main vishwaas nahin ho rahaa he ki yah bhartiya star umradraj ho gaya he
 Clarke wrote in his column in 'daily Telegraph', without Sachin Tendulkar, the Indian Test team would look very strange, who were ranked in the middle order
 vah nirantar acha pradarshan karne ko lekar kai pidiyon ke liye preranarot bane rahenge
 The Australian captain said, i was in primary school when he started his Test career and scored two centuries in his first tour of Australia at the age of 18
 maine unke khilaaf apana pehla test lagbhag ek dashak pehle khelaa tha tathaa maine apane puure kariyar ke dauraan kabhi nahin sochaa ki vah umradraj ho gaye hai
 i cannot believe that he is 40 years old
 unhone kaha, main bahut bhaagyashaalee rahaa ki main kuch mahaan ballebaajon ke saath or khilaaf khelaa hum, lekin mere samay main sachin se behatar koi nahin tha
 Looking at what he did, Sachin should rank second among all-time great batsmen after the incomparable Bradman
 clark ne kaha ki unke anusaar tendulkar kii sabase badi uplabdhi 20 saal se adhik samay se sakriy cricketer bane rahanaa he
 He said, Whenever i saw Sachin playing, i saw him playing with full enthusiasm and youth like enthusiasm
 isse pataa chalata he ki vah is khel ko ab bhi kitna chaahate hai
 Clarke said, much has been said about Sachin's achievements over the years
 unke test or vanade main record ran, antarrashtriya cricket main shatakon kaa shatak, ye aise record he, jo shaayad kabhi nahin tut paaenge
 He said, though i believe that his greatest achievement is that he has been playing in international cricket for the last nearly 25 years
 yah ullekhneey he

 jab 1974 main giri is pad se hate, to yah charchaa kaa vishay tha ki ve apane saath raashtrapati bhawan ke parade bhi le gaye hai
 The last five years have witnessed how the symbol of power has become a joke
 sonia gandhi ne 2007 main pranab mukherjee kaa naam darkinar kar pratibha patil kaa naam aage kar diya, jisase unke sahyogi thage se rah gaye or puraa desh laachaar banakar dekhtaa rah gaya
 After these five years of Mrs
 Patil's aimlessness, the demand to bring a strong man like Mukherjee to the post as the 13th President has intensified
 is baar sharad pavaar or karunanidhi chup baithne ko taiyaar nahin he
 They are already trying to tie up Sonia Gandhi's personal will with the idea of collective appreciation, so they have already supported Mukherjee's name even before the Congress has spoken
 mamata banerjee kahin zyada satark hai, lekin ve ek bengali ke khilaaf vot karne kaa jokhim nahin le saktin
 If the wind flows in this direction, then Mulayam Singh Yadav also has no problem in flowing in this direction
 bhaajapa ke bheetar bhi kuch dhadon main mukherjee ke naam ko lekar sakaaratmak raay he
 It is obvious that Mukherjee has long been considered to be entitled to this post, but ironically if any one person can deny his name then he is Sonia Gandhi himself
 sonia gandhi ke sankoch kii ek hi vyaavhaarik vajah dikhti he
 They are not sure what Mukherjee's role will be as an 'overlap'
 agar aise 'overlap‚Äô raashtrapati kaa pehla udhaaharan ginaya jaae to sabase pehle mashhoor bharatnatyam nartki rukmini devi kaa naam aata he jo raashtrapati nahin ban sakin
 We will probably never know why Prime Minister Morarji Desai, in 1977, put forward the name of the 71-year-old dancer
 morarji koi bade kala parkhi bhi nahin the
 Yes, Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy had some personal blood in her mind
 unki daavedaari ke peeche ek tathy yah tha ki shrimati indira gandhi ne 1969 main unhen raashtrapati banane se roak diya tha, lekin samay kaa pahiyaa kuch aisa ghumaa ki ek dashak ke bheetar hi jahaan se chalaa tha vahiin aa pahunchaa
 Nobody listened to Desai
 reddy raashtrapati ban gaye
 But this time the case was somewhat more curved
 1980 main reddy ne hi indira gandhi ko pradhanmantri pad kii shapath dilaai or is tarah ek 'overlap‚Äù raashtrapati kii bhoomika main aa gaye jiskaa kaarykaal rajnatik rup se virdohi do sarkaron ke bich banta hua tha
 The last overlap was President Abdul Kalam
 2004 main sonia gandhi unke paas pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari karne gai thim
 There is still controversy about what happened after that, but a day after returning from there, Sonia announced Manmohan Singh's name
 saare congressiyon ne unke tyaag ko lekar prashasti gaan gaae jise doordarshan ne puure samarpan ke saath prasaarit bhi kiya
 Article 75 leaves no room for confusion, "the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and all other ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister
" '' raashtrapati ke paas adhikaar hai ki vah apni ichha ke pradhanmantri kaa naam le saktaa he kyonki uske paas salaah ke liye koi cabinet nahin hoti, jiske faisle kaa vah intjaar karegaa
 The Prime Minister has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha, but anyone can be Prime Minister during that period
 1996 main congress chunaav haar gai thi, lekin koi bhi unase jeet nahin sakaa tha
 President Shankar Dayal Sharma, setting an example, invited the leader of the largest party, BJP, to form the government, although she herself and the BJP also knew that it would not get votes in the House
 lihaaja atal bihari vaajapeyi 13 din ke liye pradhanmantri bane
 It is different that there is no precedent law
 loksabhaa main bahumat ke maamle main partiyon kii sthiti jitani zyada aspasht hoti jaati he, raashtrapati kaa adhikaar kshetra utana hi badhata jaataa he
 In a situation when no major party has got enough seats to hold its sway over the coalition, and the smaller parties are completely free to take political or economic advantage in return for support, the danger is clearly visible
 rajyon main to akasar aisa hota rahata he
 The role of the president is going to be more important after the next general elections
 rahul gandhi kaa bhavishya kaaphi had tak raashtrapati ke faisle par nirbhar karegaa
 Mrs Sonia Gandhi is in a dilemma with both favorite candidates - Kalam and Mukherjee
 unhen lag saktaa he ki kya hamid ansaari sankat kii ghadi main kanoon ko tod-marod sakenge
 For this reason, the possibility of another 'surprise' candidate cannot be ruled out on the last week of May, or it may happen at the time of notification in June
 kisi adivasee pratyaashee par atakalein tej ho gai hai kyonki raashtrapati bhawan ko ab tak teen muslim or ek dalit sushobhit kar chuke hai
 It may be that the Congress chooses someone else to deal with Mukherjee, around whom there is scope to form a consensus
 haalanki is baar pehle se ek fark aayaa he
 In 2007, the command was in the hands of Sonia Gandhi, but this time her allies have refused to play in the hands of the politically weakened Congress to ensure the victory of the Congress
 ve ab congress ke hukum kii taamil karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 To play a bet of the future it is necessary that you secure your present first
 or is lekh ko likhe jane tak suraksha kii chhatari pranab mukherjee ke haathon main hi he
 Salman Khan's popular TV show Bigg Boss 13 is going to knock soon
 sho ko lekar hip creat honi shuru ho gai he
 The release date of the new season of the show has been revealed
 iske alaava sho ke pramotional videos bhi aane shuru ho gaye hai
 Like last season, this season, the comuners will not be a part of the show and Bigg Boss 13 will have only celebrity contestants
 khabar thi ki bollywood ke mashhoor kamedian raajapaal yadav ne sho kaa hissaa banane ke liye hami bhar di he
 But the latest reports seem to deny this
 times of india kii website kii maane to raajapaal yadav ne in khabaron kaa khandan kiya he
 In fact, like every time, this time the show's makers wanted some controverting figures to be part of the show and considered the name of actor Rajpal Yadav for this role
 unki antertaning personality, unki jumalebaji or kuch samay pehle lone ko lekar hue vivaad ke chalate ve big bos contestant ke taur par sateek baith rahe the
 Rajpal Yadav was approached for the show but refused to work on the show
 unhone kaha- har saal kii tarah is saal bhi mujhe sho ke liye ofer aayaa
 But due to work commitments, i could not be a part of the show
 mujhe ye sho dekhnaa pasand he
 This is very interesting
 magar main is sijan main is sho kaa part nahin ban saktaa
 Best wishes from the contestants participating in the show
 big bos 13 main part lene vaale contestant main karan patel, devolina bhattacharya, jarine khan, rashmi desai or ankitha lokhande jaise kalakaaron ke bhaag lene kii charchaa he
