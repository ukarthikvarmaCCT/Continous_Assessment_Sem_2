 It has been written in the book that Trump has not been able to remember his old friends and old things for the last few days

 unhone likhaa ki pad sanbhaalane ke ek saal baad ab ek nai theory saamne ai he
 He said that in my whole life there have been only two forces, one is the mentor position and the other is being smart

 ' chhattisgarh main sarkari bonus ke adayegi ke baavjood kisaanon kii aatmahatya tham nahin paa rahi he
 Five farmers have committed suicide in a week whereas 197 farmers have committed suicide in a year
 sarkaar hairat main he kyonki uskaa daawa he ki kisaanon ke hit main kai kadam uthaae jane ke baavjood kisaan maut ko gale laga rahe hai
 When the government investigated suicides, it was found that most of the suicides were not due to government loans but due to taking loans from local moneylenders
 philhal chori chhipe or gaiyr licency sahukaaron ke khilaaf kaarywahi kiye jane ko lekar kisaan sadakon par he
 According to farmers, they get loans at very high interest rates
 iske chalate unhen apana khet khaliyaan girvee rakhana padataa he or sahuukaar itnaa dabaav bana dete he ki aatmahatya ke alaava koi doosraa kadam nahin rah jaataa
 Farmers in Chhattisgarh have become so burdened with the debt burden of moneylenders that they do not understand whether to live life or to follow in the footsteps of the farmers who have embraced death
 masalan ve bhi aatmahayaa jaisaa kadam uthaa len
 The reason is clear
 kisaano par karj adayegi kii dohari maar pad rahi he
 One is the loan of banks and cooperative institutions and the other is the loan of moneylenders of village towns
 ye wo sahuukaar he jinke paas naa to vaidhanik taur par kisi ko karj yaa udhaar dene kaa license he or naa hi kisi tarah kaa kanoonee adhikaar patr
 They only have big money in their knot, by which they earn double and night quadruple
 aise sahukaaron ke liye kisaan naa keval khaas graahak he balki unki kamai kaa mukhya jariya bhi he kyonki ek kaa das karne kaa mauka inhen kisaano se miltaa he
 Apart from this, whether it is a government officer or police or police station, everyone has their protection
 kisaanon ko musiibat padane par ve hi kaam aate hai kyonki kisi ek bank yaa sanstha se karj lene ke baad us karj kii adayegi tak koi doosraa bank nae sire se unhen karj nahin detaa
 In such a situation, no matter how high the interest rate is, the farmers have to go to the shelter of the moneylenders of the villages and towns
 unheen kii badaulat hi ve khaad beej bhi kharid pate he or buaai bhi karte he
 But this money lender has now become the reason for the death of farmers
 karj pe karj or us par unchi byaaj ke daron ne unka jeena dubhar kar diya he
 Non-licensee money lenders in the state are charging interest of up to five per cent per day, while nationalized banks only charge ten to twelve per cent annually
 chhattisgarh main gaiyr kanoonee dhang se teen tarah kii karj dene kii pratha saalon se chali aa rahi he
 The first Hataki system, the second daily practice and the third menstrual practice
 in teenon hi prathaon main kisaano kii haalat patali kar di he
 The day the farmer borrows the money, the moneylenders' bag starts filling up with cash
 chakravriddhi byaaj kii daren itani unchi he ki gaanv kasbon main yahi naaraa sunai detaa he
 As long as the sun is moon, the names of those paying interest will remain in the ledger
 chhattisgarh main kisaano ke paanch harsh power tak ke panpon ko muft bijli, khaad beej main riyaayat, or muft krishi salaah ke alaava kai tarah kii chhot die jane ke baavjood chhattisgarh main kisaan aatmahatyae kar rahe hai
 Suicides are also happening at a time when the Chief Minister of the state Raman Singh is searching the village to give a bonus of 21 hundred crores to the farmers
 prayagraj main medical kii chaatra ko chalati bas se agava karne ke baad uske saath gangrape kiye jane kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 When the student protested against the gangrape, the accused beat her up
 chaatra behoshee kii haalat main sunsaan jagah par mili
 He is being treated in a government hospital in the city
 police ne is maamle main nau aropiyon ke khilaaf cese darj kar tafteesh shuru kar di he
 One of the three named accused has been arrested
 peedit chaatra ko kumbh mela kshetra se sate jhunsi ilaake se us vakt agava kiya gaya, jab vah prayagraj se varanasi ja rahi thi
 Police officials say that strict action will be taken against the accused in this case

 In response, Jha challenged Verma to prove the charge by giving him a seven-day ultimatum and sat on a dharna outside Varma's house in Indore
 idhar verma bhi thik usee vakt bhopal main jha ke nivas ke baahar congressi kaaryakartaaon ke saath dharne par baithe the
 According to sources, many BJP leaders have not been able to digest Jha's attempt to bring the political charges-counter-fight on a personal level
 lekin jha india today se kehete hai, ''mujhe verma ke kshetra ke logon ko bataanaa tha ki unke saansad jhuthe hai
 We have exposed them in their house
 ''udhar verma kehete hai, ''maine kabhi sidhe taur par jha kaa naam nahin liya, balki unke parijanon ke naam jameen hone kii baat kahi he
 i have his raw paper
 hamaare kaaryakarta ne sihor jila colector ke paas artiai laga rakhi he, lekin jha ke dabaav main colector ne do maheene se jawaab nahin diya he
 "he further says," If Jha is so clean then get the collector to reply to RTI, everything will be cleared
 ''verma kaa daawa he ki sihor jile main essi-asti ke patte kii jameen kisi savarna ko colector kii anumati ke bina nahin di ja sakati
 "some people of Jha's family have taken this land," he alleges
 '' verma ne jha ke parijanon ke naam jameen hone kaa bayaan us vakt diya tha, jab bhaajapa netaaon ke kareebi maane jane vaale do vyavsaayiyon-dilip suryavanshi or sudhir sharma-ke yahaan iskar ke chaape pade the or jha ne centre sarkaar par inhen fansaane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Jha says, "it is wrong to make allegations without grounds
" main har saal apni sampatti ghoshit karata hum
 The people of Congress are interested in the land
 ho saktaa he ki jameen lene waalon main hamaare log bhi shaamil rahe hon lekin iskaa mujhe pataa nahin he
 I'm just not into it
 aarope lagane se pehle verma ko apane girebaan main jhankna chahie
 On the question arising in the party on his move, Jha says, "when he (congress) has no culture in politics, why should we sit silent?" Everyone has freedom of expression
 ''apane bachaav main jha ne sihor jila prashasan se pramaan patr hasil kar liya he, jisamen unke naam koi jameen nahin hona bataaya gaya he
 The district administration has given another letter to Jha, in which Verma was named as the minister in charge of Sehore district in 2002

 There is mention of buying 14 acres of land

 nepal ne 'kalapani' kshetra ko bhartiya kshetra main dikhaae jane par sakht etraj jataayaa
 It says that talks are going on between India and Nepal regarding the area concerned and the issue is still 'unresolved'
 nepal ke videsh mantralay ne ek din pehle buudhvaar ko apane bayaan main 'kalapani' ko nepal kaa abhinn ang bataaya
 In a statement issued to the media, the Nepal government said that the responsibility of finding a solution to the unresolved border dispute was left to the foreign secretaries of the two countries at the nepal-india Common Commission meeting held at the level of foreign ministers of the two countries

 Ravish Kumar said that the inauguration of Kartarpur Corridor is a historic event and it is not important to give preference to any one person

 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ravish Kumar said that the government knows that a bilateral document has been signed between India and Pakistan
 is dastavej main saaf-saaf bataaya gaya he ki shraddhaluon ko koun-koun se document apane saath lekar jane honge
 He said that any kind of amendment in the mou cannot be done by one party and it is necessary to have the consent of both the parties
 basapa pramukh mayawati ne pichley saal vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad rajasthan or madhya pradesh main congress ko samarthan kaa elaan kiya tha
 He explained the reason for this, "we do not agree with the Congress ideology but are supporting BJP to keep it away from power
" '' saaf he, mayawati ke liye dushman number ek bhaajapa he
 But looking at the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, they are also angry with their enemy number two, the Congress
 darasal, congress ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke liye saat siton par pratyaashee nahin utaarne kii baat kar di
 To this, Mayawati retorted, "we want to clarify that in any state of the country we neither have an alliance with Congress, nor any kind of agreement
" '' basapa pramukh kaa yah bayaan anayas nahin he
 In fact, the bsp's core vote bank (dalit) has disintegrated since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 us chunaav main basapa ek bhi seat jeet nahin pai thi
 She was seen as a Modi wave by Mayawati, but the results of the 2017 UP Assembly elections were enough to bring a wrinkle on Mayawati's face
 nateezon ne saaf kar diya tha ki basapa ke kor vot bank main send lag chuki he
 The BJP succeeded in getting non-jatav voters among Dalits with them
 2018 ke chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav main basapa ne phir apni takat aajamaani chaahi
 The BSP formed an alliance with Ajit Jogi there and tried to convey indirectly to the Congress that the Congress would have to resort to the BSP to deal with the BJP
 lekin mayawati kaa andaja galat sabit hua
 Says a senior Congress leader, "mayawati's real problem has come after the Chhattisgarh election results
 abhi tak ve yah maan rahi thim ki unka vot bank agar thodaa-bahut tuutata bhi he to vah bhaajapa kii ore zyada dinon tak nahin rahegaa, waapas basapa ke paale main aayega
 But the results of Chhattisgarh have told that Dalits can turn to Congress
 '' congress se basapa kaa spasht parhez isi kaa nateeja he
 a BSP leader says, "the BSP is avoiding the congress-bjp, but the BJP is a serious challenge in terms of losing elections, then the Congress is a big challenge in terms of losing the party
" ''darasal, bhaajapa kaa kor vot bank, basapa se ekadam alag he
 Forward caste and business class are the core voters of BJP, while Dalits and Muslims also have many options
 agar daliton main yah baat faili ki congress ke saath basapa kaa paroksh talmail he to upi sahit kai rajyon main, basapa samarthak congress ko vot de sakate hai
 Especially in UP, the way the Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi is trying to revive the party, the Dalit and Muslim sections can turn to the Congress
 vaise congress media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, ''upi main congress alag lag rahi he
 The SP-BSP alliance also aims to defeat the BJP, so we have no opposition with them
 ham sirf bhaajapa ke khilaaf hai or aam chunaav main congress acha pradarshan karegi

 suraksha ke kharaab bandobast ke baavjood deepika ne apana kaam puraa kiya or uske baad hi ve vahaan se gayi
 Isn't it amazing Deepika mumbai hamalon ke maamle main sabooton par sawaal uthaane vaale pakistan kii pole ek baar phir khul gai he
 This time this pole has opened today
 aaj takke haath lag gai hai kasaab or uske saathi abu ismail ke diene report
 Which has exposed the lies of Pakistan
 aaj tak ke haath lagi chuki he ajmal aamir kasaab or uske saathi abu ismail kii diene report
 Which is completely different from each other
 haalanki pakistan ke is daawey ko mumbai krime branch ne usee din khaarij kar diya tha
 Recently, Pakistan claimed that the DNA report of the terrorists given in the Mumbai attacks case has a lot of flaws
 paak ke aantarik mantri rahamaan malik kaa daawa tha ki mumbai hamalon main maare gayi abu ismail naam ke aatanki or is maamle main giraftaar ekmaatr zindaa aatankwaadi ajmal aamir kasaab kii dienai report ek samaan hai
 But these reports, which have been handed over to Aaj Tak, have given way to the claims of Pakistan
 abu ismail ke diene report jisamen asatiar locas ke shruwati teen ank he 12,13 / 28,30 / 11,11
 The first three digits in the report of YSTR locus are 15, 14 and 25
 jabaki kasaab kii diene reportmen asatiar locas ke pehle teen ank hai 13,13 / 33
 2,34
 2 / 10,11 or vyasatiar locas he 15,14 or 23
 There is a great difference in DNA report of these two
 haalanki grahamantri pi chidambaram ne ek clerical mistek kii baat maan to lee he lekin koi bayaan dene se pehle paak mantri rahamaan malik ko soch lenaa chahie tha ki is report par khud interpol kii muhar bhi lag chuki he
 However, this is not the first time that Pakistan has made an absurd statement in the Mumbai attack case
 or ye bhi sach he ki pakistan ko apane bayaan se kai baar palatnaa bhi padaa he lekin wo din dur nahi jab ye sari baaten mumbai kii vishesh adaalat main bhi sabit ho jaayengi or doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jaayegaa

 pradhan nyaayadhish ke
 Yes
 balakrishnan ne kaha he ki nichali adaalaton ke bhrasht nyaayadhishon ko swechha se pad chhod dena chahie
 In such a situation, they should also get pension benefits like the government employees who have stepped down due to suspicious behavior
 ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhishon ko mangalvaar ko bheje patr main balakrishnan ne suzav diya he ki ucch nyaayalayon ko lok sevaaon ke liye lagu moulik kanoon kaa anusaran karnaa chahie
 Under this law, if the credibility of a government official is suspected, but no case is filed against him, in such a case the officer retires prematurely, then the full benefit of gratuity, provident fund and pension is available
 is
 is kanoon main yahi bhi vyavastha he ki yadi koi sarkari adhikari aparaadh yaa bhrashtachar kaa aupchaarik maamla darj hone ke baad avkaash praapt karata he, to vah puraa gracuty or masik pension kaa ek bada hissaa paane kaa hakdaar nahin rah jaataa he

 shankh or likhit param tapasvi rishi the
 Both brothers
 ek din likhit, shankh ke ashram par pahunche
 The conch had gone somewhere
 bhukhe likhit, ashram ke vrikshon se fal todakar khaane lage
 Conch came in this
 unhone likhit se poocha ki fal todgaye se pehle kisi kii anumati lee thi?likhit niruttar the
 Shankh said, this is theft
 aapako raja sudyumna se dand maangane janaa hoga
 Wrote to the written court and pleaded to punish him by telling the whole episode
 raja ne kaha, aparaadh ko main kshamaa karata hum
 Likha said, no, i will have to suffer the punishment
 rishi ke aagrah par raja ne unke donon haath katwa die, jo chori ke aparaadh kii sajaa thi
 Losing his hand, he reached the conch again
 shankh ne unhen nadi main snaan or tap karne ke liye kaha or (jaisaa ki mithkon main hota he) snaan karte hi likhit ke haath waapas aa gaye
 Written again came to the conch and asked that when you could sanctify me with your tenacity then why the punishment? Shankha said that we are ascetic, people consider us ideal, so even our small crime is not excusable
 rahi baat dand kii to vah meraa adhikaar nahin he isliye aapako raja ke paas bheja
 The story then does not say anything about the conch and the script, but rather states that King Sudyumna Sashir, who also punished the sage on the parameters of justice, went to heaven
 mahabharat ke shanti parv main yah kahani vyas ne yudhisthir ko sunai thi jo yuddh ke baad nyaayadharm ke antargat yah sikh rahe the kickekah jo samaaj main jitna ooncha he, uskaa aparaadh utana hi bada hota he
 Two: The king who punishes the guilty sage is also revered
 gurmeet singh par adaalat ke faisle ko gaur se padhuya chahie
 The echoes of awe echo throughout the decision
 maano kahana chahta ho ki sant or balaatkaar! yah kaise sahan ho saktaa he? dharm ko jivan mulya or nyaay maanane vaale samaaj ke liye yah bardaasht karnaa asambhav he ki uske anany vishwaas kaa karnadhaar koi sant younachari bhi ho saktaa he
 The most difficult to judge is when a person sitting on the peak of the faith of the society is in the box
 aasaan nahin rahaa hoga ek dambhi-lanpat sant par faisla karnaa jo lakhon bhole anuyaayiyon or rajnatik rasookh kii takat se dakaarta hua nyaay ko marodsa chahta tha
 Knowing the possibility of violence after the verdict, the judge was able to sentence Gurmeet because he was able to hear the restlessness that was embarrassing us as a religious society
 kya bharat kii adaalatein lanpat saadhuon ke prati atirikt kathor ho rahi hai? lokapriyata ke shikhar par baithe logon ke aparaadh ko lekar adaalatein zyada hi aakraamak hai? yadi hakeekat main aisa he to hamen swayan par garv karnaa chahie
 This is the thing that does not destroy our celebrity
 kahin na kahin, koi na koi aage aakar hamen ummid kaa diya pakadaa jaataa he
 If the courts are being ruthless about rapist babas or high-ranking criminals, it is a qualitative change in the judicial system that we did not have to light candles on the street to bring
 adaalaton kii sakriyata par chintit hone kii bajaae yah jaananaa behatar hoga ki 21veen sadi main carch kii sabase badi uljhan darasal yon kunthit va balaatkaari bishap or pujari hai
 In June this year, Pope Francis' financial adviser and a Vatican supreme cardinal, George Pell, was sentenced by a Melbourne court for sexual offenses (when he was Archbishop of Australia)
 catholic carch main yon or bal shoshan ke maamle lagaataar surkhiyon main he
 The Vatican has long been the target of the Western press for nearly 2000 complaints of sexual abuse in the church
 carch bharat kii adaalaton se kuch siikhnaa chahega?vaise, bharat kii adaalatein ek tarah kaa praayshchit bhi kar rahi hai
 He was not so strict on criminals and corrupt politicians
 apradhi santon ke maamle main yah galati nahin doharaai ja rahi he
 Will politicians distance themselves from lustful gurus? Will a law be made to stop the baba-fakirs creating illegal empires by showing social service? Will Hindutva pioneers protect innate Indians from those who tarnish Indian spirituality? i don't know! But Gurmeet, who was crying in court, was giving this big advice to all of us
 anuyaayiyon kii bheed guru kii pavitrataa kii guarantee nahin he

 At the initiative of the Ministry of Power, the Ganga Ghat of Banaras is shining with the light of LED lights these days
 dashashwamedh ghat se shuru kii gai safed rang kii LED lits dhire-dhire sabhi ghaaton par lag gai hai
 All these exercises have been done to further improve the heritage look of the Ghats of Benares
 par banaras ke logon ko ye roshni pasand nahin
 They feel that these white LED lights are making the Ghats of Benaras look like a corporate, mall or business street, in which the divine form of the oldest city of Kashi has been lost
 banaras ke sahityakar, kalakaar, photographeron ko bhi ye dudhia roshni raas nahin aa rahi he
 They believe that this light has destroyed all the beauty of the beauty of the Ghats of Banaras, because these stone ghats always come alive in yellow light
 dudhia roshni ne to isaki jeevantata hi khatm kar di
 Some people go a step further and say that this white light has destroyed the beauty of our lively ghats
 lihaaza, is elidi lit kaa virodh shuru ho gaya he
 People have written to the Prime Minister complaining about this
 kalakaar, diziner ankitha khatri bade baari man se kahati hai "pehle jab ham log aate the pili roshni thi
 The night scene looked very panoramic
 pili roshni se ek aadhyatm kaa bhav man main jaagta tha or jab wo ganga ji main padati thim to ek riflaction aata tha, wo uski khubsuurati ko or badha detaa tha
 Ever since these white lights have been installed, the ghats have remained the same, but a complexion has started to feel very bad
 darasal, safed roshni or pili roshni main ye ghat kaise lagate hai, iskaa virodh yun hi nahin he
 In order to tell the difference, the people of Banaras imprisoned in their cameras have tried to explain it through photographs
 is antar ko tasveeron ke jariye samajha ja saktaa he ki kaise pili roshni main jo ghat jeevant nazar aate hai, vahi ghat safed roshni main sapaat nazar aate hai
 This is the reason why these photographers are opposing it
 is roshni ke asar ko samajhaate hue street photographer manish khatri bataate hai ki "safed lite har subject ko flat kar detii he
 But the yellow color adds an esthetic sense to it and enhances its aura
 '' Experts of lights are even more worried that during the fog days in winter, these white lights will become very deadly
 sidhiyon par kisi ko kuch nazar nahin aayega or log durghatana ke shikaar honge
 Whereas this does not happen in yellow light
 is roshni ko hataane ke liye in logon ne urja mantri piyush goyal se shikaayat kar apni tasveeron ke jariye vajah ko samajhane kii koshish bhi kii, lekin unhone khud is roshni ke antar ko apane mobile main kuch yun kehete hue ki "virodh karne vaale jo log hai, unako har acchhee cheez kaa virodh karnaa 'dharm lagata he' or ise khaarij kar diya

 If every light has its own beauty, then every light has the power to paint anyone in its own color, but experts say that yellow light also adds life to lifeless things
 aisi takat safed roshni main kahaan? yahi vajah he ki banaras ke log apane jeevant ghaaton ko is safed roshni se nijaat dilaakar pili roshni se roshan karnaa chaahate hai

 Luck was with India at the PCA Stadium
 sachin tendulkar ne chaar jeevandaan or refral kaa phayda uthaakar 115 gend par 85 ran banaaye
 Virender Sehwag (38) gave the team a stormy start but the pace slowed down due to the shaking of Wahab Riaz (five wickets for 46 runs)
 suresh raina ne aakhir main 36 ran kii acchhee pari kheli jisase bharat ne nau wicket par 260 ran kaa chunauteepurn score khadaa kiya
 The bowlers made a difference in the match

 misbah-ul-haq scored 56 off 76 balls but Pakistan 49

 Virender Sehwag (38), Gautam Gambhir (29) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (25) could not convert a good start into a big score
 suresh raina 36 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Riyaz proved to be a murderer for Indians
 unhone apane karier kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan karte hue 46 ran dekar paanch wicket liye or shoeb akhtar kii kami nahin khalane di
 The most important thing is that the Indian batsmen could not play in front of the spinners
 pakistan ke teenon spinner ne 30 over main keval 123 ran diye
 Among them, off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was the most successful
 unhone 44 ran dekar do wicket liye
 India got a stormy start by Sehwag and it seemed that the team would cross the 300 runs but the run slowed down as they lost wickets at regular intervals in between
 alam yah tha ek samay 15 over tak gend seemaa rekha paar hi nahin gayi
 Sehwag maintained the order of opening the account by hitting a four in this World Cup and today his target was Umar Gul against whom he smashed the Pakistani attack by scoring eight fours in 19 balls
 tendulkar kaa bhagya ne puraa saath diya
 He presented a masterpiece of his artistry and placement against Riyaz in the eighth over but the silence fell in the stadium when umpire Ian Gauld's finger was lifted against Ajmal's lbw against him

 The ball was in line but the replays showed that she was dropping the leg stump

 He played a loose drive off Ajmal and Afridi made no mistake in taking a catch on extra cover
 tendulkar ne 115 gend kheli or 11 chauke lagaaye
 Meanwhile, the pressure on Tendulkar also increased with three consecutive wickets falling at the other end

 The audience was heartbroken
 unki dhadkane bad gayi thi lekin dhoni ne riyaj kii hetric nahin banane di
 After this, when the next ball went for four runs with the edge of Dhoni's bat, only a few applause rang out
 lekin bhartiya team dabaav main aa chuki thi or pakistani gendbaaji haaavee ho gayi the
 The point was that after the 30th over, the ball had to wait till the 45th over to see the boundary line and in the meantime the team lost the wickets of Tendulkar and Dhoni
 dhoni ko bhi jeevandaan mila lekin vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye

 Big Boss house
 ' He was informed about the upcoming elections from states like Bihar, Jharkhand on the political survey Political Stock Exchange (PSE) of Aaj Tak
 isse yah saamne aayaa he ki janata kise dekhnaa pasand karti he or yah bhi saamne aayaa ki janata ke bich bade mudde kya hai
 During this time public opinion also came out on the prices of Rafale and Petrol diesel
 bihar main kul 40 sansadeey siton par 15,375 logon ke bichpiesaika survey kiya gaya
 The survey was conducted between 22 September and 26 September
 pradhanmantri pad kii jahaan tak baat he, tobiharki 58 fisadi janata piem modi ko pasand karti he, jabaki 32 fisadi logon kii pasand rahul gandhi hai
 The survey also revealed that 48 per cent of people are satisfied with the work of PM Modi, while 20 per cent people have said that their work is right
 28 fisadi log aise bhi hai jinhen piem modi kaa kaam pasand nahin he
 Now talk about petrol-diesel prices
 survey main yah baat nikal kar saamne ai ki bihar ke 89 fisadi logon kii maang he ki centre sarkaar jitna jald ho sake, telon ke daam ghataae
 6 percent of such people were found, who do not mind the price of petrol and diesel and such people are not supportive of reducing the price
 piesai main rafel deal par bhi logon kii raay jaani gai
 Let me tell you that the Congress has made Rafael Deal its biggest weapon against the Modi government
 congress ise bhavi aam chunaavon main bhunaane kii puri koshish main lagi he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi himself has taken this issue under his command, but it is not a big issue in Bihar
 piesai ke survey main yah baat saamne ai ki bihar ke maatr 24 fisadi log hi rafel deal ke bare main jaanate hai
 74 percent people are not aware of Rafael
 survey main yah sawaal bhi poocha gaya ki kya modi sarkaar ko rafel vimaanon kii keemten saarvajanik kerani chahie? isapar 38 pratishat logon ne hami bhari, jabaki 62 pratishat logon kaa mat he ki sarkaar ko keemten bataane kii koi jarurat nahin
 The issue of Rafael in Bihar does not seem favorable to the Congress because the issue of which the Congress President is protesting the most, the majority of the people of Bihar are almost unaware of this issue
 rafel mudde ke bare main bihar ke log nahin jaanate, is sawaal par congress ke pravaktaa gaurav vallabh ne piesai main kaha ki abhi log bhale na jaanate hon lekin jis din centre sarkaar ke is bhrashtachar kii jaankaree hogi, us din 74 fisad anjaan log congress ke saath jud jaaenge
 Congress today approached the Election Commission against bjp's use of 'har Har Modi' slogan in Varanasi and said that using religion is against the provisions of the Election Code of Conduct
 maaloom ho ki varanasi se bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi chunaav lard rahe hai
 The Congress demanded the bjp's withdrawal of recognition from the Election Commission that the main opposition party was denying that 'har har Modi, ghar ghar Modi' was its official slogan but despite this party workers in Varanasi continued to use it are doing
 congress ne kaha ki modi ne varanasi main ek jansabha ko sambodhit kiya, jahaan manch par peeche bhagwaan shiv kaa chitra lagaaya gaya tha jisaki chunaav aachaar samhita ke tahat ijaajat nahin he
 The memorandum, filed under the signature of KC Mittal, the head of the Congress's legal cell, states that Lord Shiva or Mahadev and the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Benares have religious sanctity all over the world
 hindu or bhagwaan mahadev ko maanane vaale sabhi shraddhalu bhagwaan kaa aashirwad praapt karne ke liye puri shraddha ke saath 'har har mahadev or ghar ghar mahadev' kaa jap karte hai
 No human can replace Lord Mahadev in this hymn
 congress ne aarope lagaaya ki lagata he ki bijepi kii ore se is naare kaa istemaal modi ko bhagwaan mahadev ke rup main pesh karne kii ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 So that the religious sentiments of the people can be exploited for electoral gains
 akhabaari khabaron kaa ullekh karte hue gyaapan main kaha gaya ki bijepi ne ‘har har modi, ghar ghar modi' ke naaron ke saath alsidi tivi yukt 400 mobile vine kii vyavastha kii he
 The BJP has now come up with a new slogan 'modi in the heart, Modi in the house, Modi in Kashi kan kan kan Modi', the memorandum said that the purpose of this new slogan is also to incite the religious sentiments of the people
 gyaapan main yah bhi daawa kiya gaya ki bijepi ke is naare 'abaki baar modi sarkaar' ko bhi istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki yah asanvaidhanik or aloktantric he
 In Indian democracy, no individual alone has the legal right to form political parties

 However, the police have not yet ensured any action against the school
 jaankaree ke mutabik is maamle kii shikaayat shashan-prashasan ko bhi di gai he, lekin philhal is maamle par abhi tak koi sunwaayee nahin hui he
 At the same time, there has been a demand from the victim family on this matter that the recognition of such schools be canceled and strict action should be taken
 gauratlab he ki kuch din purv ek skool main kuch chaatro ne ek chaatra ke saath gangrape kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 There was a ruckus after the incident of the girl becoming pregnant

 Apart from this, the rape victim is also trying for admission
 haalanki kai skulon ne peedita ko daakhila dene se manaa kar diya he
 On the other hand, due to lack of admission in Dehradun's schools, now the victim's student has been admitted by relatives in a school in Meerut in Uttar Pradesh
 dehradun ke kuch skulon main peedit chaatra ko admician naa dene jaise maamle ko lekar esaspi nivedita kaa kahana he ki sidhe taur par unke paas aisi koi shikaayat to nahin ai he, lekin espi dehaat sarita dobaal ke paas jarur peedit ladki ke parijan dwaara is maamle par kaint kshetra sthit ek skool kii shikaayat jarur ai he, uski jaanch karai ja rahi he, taaki aage kii karrwai kii ja sake
 State Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat regretted the gang rape victim not getting admission in Dehradun's school and said that the notion is wrong, the girl should get admission
 jis skool dwaara aisa kiya gaya he uski jaanch kii jaaegi aakhir usne aisa kyon kiya he
 The Chief Minister, while defending the case, has also cited the technical problem as the reason

 mahashivaratri aane ko he or sabhi bhakton ne isaki dhoomdhaam se taiyaari shuru kar di he
 There are many beliefs about Mahashivaratri
 aaj aapako bataate hai bhagwaan shiv or mata parvati ke vivaah kii kahani
 Yes, it is claimed in the Puranas that Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were married on the festival of Mahashivaratri
 to chaliye aaj aapako bhi avgat karavaate hai is khubasurat katha se-mata parvati bhagwaan shiv se vivaah karne kii icchhuk thim
 All the gods were also of the opinion that Parvati, the mountain Rajakanya, should be married to Shiva
 devataaon ne kandarpa ko parvati kii madd karne ke liye bheja
 But Shiva consumed him with his third eye
 ab parvati ne to thaan liya tha ki wo vivaah karengi to sirf bholenath se
 Mata Parvati started very harsh penance to make Shiva her bridesmaid
 unki tapasya ke chalate sabhi jagah haahaakaar much gaya
 The foundations of big mountains began to waver
 ye dekh bhole baba ne apni aankh kholi or parvati se aavahan kiya ki wo kisi samrudh rajkumaar se shaadi karen
 Shiva also emphasized that it is not easy to live with an ascetic
 lekin mata parvati to adig thi, unhone saaf kar diya tha ki wo vivaah sirf bhagwaan shiv se hi karengi
 Seeing this insistence of Parvati, Bholenath melted and agreed to marry her
 shiv ko laga ki parvati unhi kii tarah hathi he, isliye ye jodi acchhee banegi
 Now preparations for marriage started in full swing
 lekin samasya ye thi ki bhagwaan shiv ek tapasvi the or unke parivaar main koi sadsy nahin tha
 But the belief was that a groom has to go with his family and ask for the bride's hand
 ab aisi paristhiti main bhagwaan shiv ne apane saath daakiniyaan,bhoot-pret or chudilon ko saath le jane kaa nirnay kiya
 Shiva, being an ascetic, was not aware of how to prepare for marriage
 to unke daakiniyon or chudilon ne unako bhasma se sajaa diya or haddiyon kii maala pahana di
 When this unique procession reached the door of Parvati, all the gods were shocked
 vahaan khadi mahilaayein bhi dar kar bhaag gai
 Parvati's mother could not accept Lord Shiva in this strange form and she refused to give her daughter's hand
 sthitiyaan bigadati dekh parvati ne shiv se prathana kii wo unke reeti rivaajon ke mutabik taiyaar hokar aane
 Shiva accepted his prayer and ordered all the gods to dress him beautifully
 ye sun sabhi devtaa harakat main aa gaye or unhen taiyaar karne main jute gaye
 Lord Shiva was bathed in divine water and decorated with silk flowers
 thodi hi der main bholenath kandarpa se bhi zyada sudanr lagane lage or unka gorapan to chand kii roshni ko bhi maat de rahaa tha
 When Lord Shiva arrived in this divine form, Parvati's mother immediately accepted him and the marriage ceremony started in the presence of Brahma

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Sunday that it would follow the leadership of social activist Anna Hazare in the fight against corruption
 bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne nagpur main kaha, "hamaari party tab tak anna hajaare ke saath he, jab tak ham bhrashtachar mukt, paardarshee loktantr ke nae yug main pravesh nahin kar jate
 "feeling relieved when Anna Hazare's fast is over," he said, "we promise you that your leadership will support you to fulfill your dream in any future rally or procession if needed in future
" BJP will always be ready to give
 " gadakari ne kaha ki congress ne is galat dharna ko prachaarit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha ki bhaajapa sansad main anna hajaare kii maangon ke khilaaf matdaan ke paksh main he
 At his residence in Nagpur, he told reporters, "even after giving a letter in support of Anna Hazare, the rumor was spread that we are against passing the resolution
" jab hamane spasht kiya ki ham prastaav paarit karne or paksh main matdaan ke liye taiyaar hai, tab congress ko ise sweekaar karnaa padaa
 "on the other hand, in New Delhi, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar also called it a victory for the common man and said that this shows the maturity of parliamentary democracy
 unhone kaha, "ham aaj ramlila maidan main jo dekh rahe hai, vah aam aadmi ke rukh kaa ek nayaa ahsaas he
 This will eventually usher in a new era of rapid progress
 " gyaat ho ki 74 varshiya anna hajaare ne sansad or sarkaar se jan lokapal vidheyak main shaamil apni teen pramukh maangon par aashwaasan milane ke baad ravivaar ko ramlila maidan main terahaven din apana anshan samaapt kiya

 After marriage many women complain that their husbands do not give them the respect they should get
 rishta khatthey-mithe palon kaa mishran he
 If there is only badness in the relationship between husband and wife, then that relationship has no meaning
 shaadi ke rishte ko sahejane ke liye pati or patni donon ko hi baraabar koshishen kerani chahie
 If even a single person does not fulfill his responsibility, then the relationship is weakened
 aaie jaanate hai purushon kii un aadaton ke bare main jinaki vajah se ve achche pati nahin ban pate hai
 These 8 changes suddenly occur in boys after marriage! 1- Criticizing - It has been seen many times that husbands are seen criticizing their wives in front of others
 yaa kabhi-kabhi apane man-pasand kaa khaanaa naa milane par bhi unhen tarah-tarah kii baaten sunaate hai
 It is wrong to do so
 aapako unhen ye bataane kii jarurat he ki unki koun si baat aapako pasand nahin ai
 After this you also need to praise their good works
 2- roak-tok lagaana-shaadi ke baad pati apni patniyon par tarah-tarah kii roak-tok lagaate rahete hai
 They need to understand that as they have some desires, so do others
 zyada roak-tok se patniyon ke swabhaav main chidchidapan aa jaataa he
 Like men, they should have complete freedom to make friends, move around, so that they can feel free in their life and they do not feel any kind of bond with you
 3- unhen sirf ek kaam karne kii mashin samajhnaa-agar aap roj daftar jate hai to mahilaayein bhi ghar main gruhasthi sanbhaalane kaa kaam karti hai
 In such a situation, it is not a great thing to do more work than them
 aajkal to mahilaayein offis ke saath-saath ghar-gruhasthi ke kaam karti hai
 In such a situation, if the husband takes the burden of small tasks in the house, then it will be a matter of great comfort for the wives
 purana pyaar waapas chaahate hai to yaad rakhen ye 4 baaten4- pyaar jataana bhul janaa-dinabhar kii bhagdaud main vyastata ke kaaran kai baar pati apni patniyon ko paryaapt samay nahin de pate hai
 If you are busy, take atleast 2 minutes and take them out and tell them how much you love them and how important they are in your life
 5- baat karne kaa galat lahaza-pati-patni ek gaadi ke do pahie hote hai
 It cannot be possible for both of them to be without each other
 donon ko ek-duusare kii jarurat hoti he
 Sometimes husbands express anger at their wife due to work stress or sometimes they do not talk properly
 aise main aapako baat karte samay vinamr hone kii jarurat he taaki unhen bhaavnaatmak thes naa pahunche
 She wants some moment of love from you, if you do this everyday then she will be most happy
 couples kii in aadaton se iritate hote hai log!6- jhooth naa bolen-agar aapako lagata he ki aap shaadi ke baad kisi or ke saath rishta banane kii koshish karenge or aapaki patni isse anjaan rahegi to ye aapaki galatfahami he
 Every relationship has an affinity and you cannot build a relationship on the basis of lies
 isliye jaruri he ki aap rishta nibhaate vakt apni patni ke prati eemaandaar rahane kii koshish karen
 7- Expecting high expectations - During the course of a relationship, one starts expecting more from others
 har insaan ke andar swaarth swaabhaavik rup se maujuud hota he
 It is not wrong to expect someone to an extent
 magar ye bhi samajhnaa jaruri he ki har insaan ke andar agar kuch pratibhaaen hai to duusari taraf kuch khamiyaan bhi hai
 No human can satisfy you in every way
 aapako ye samajhane kii jarurat he ki aap zyada aakankshaayen rakhane kii bajaae apane life partner se pyaar or aadar kaa bhav rakhen

 siaisi ne kaha he ki kharch sarkari rajasav se hua to ise vanijyik gopneeyata tathaa vishwaas sambandhi kshamta ke tahat roka nahin ja saktaa he
 The Commission rejected the pleas of Air India Central Public Information Officer that the information pertained to commercial secrecy
 aapako bataa den ki RTI kaaryakarta lokentre batra ne isko lekar siaisi se jaankaree maangi thi
 Earlier, the name of the accompanying person was asked to tell you that earlier also the Central Information Commission had ordered the Prime Minister to provide information about the members of the delegation going on their foreign visits
 mukhya soochna ayukta aarake maathur ne PMO ko nirdesh diya tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath unki videsh yatraaon par jane vaale pratinidhimandal ke sadasyon ke naam bataae jaaen
 Mathur rejected the objection raised by the PMO citing 'national security'
 air india ne apane bayaan main kaha tha ki PMO ne disambar 2016 main mail bhejkar uske afasar ko kaha tha ki piem ke daure se jude sawaal suraksha ke lihaaj se ahm hai, isliye inhen saarvajanik nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 This was the reason that the CIC had given a little leeway to the airline, saying that the date of travel, their duration and the name of the place associated with the pm's visit are important for safety, hence the details of these will not be available

 uttar pradesh ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bhartiya janata party or congress kuch isi manodasha ke saath maidan main utar rahi hai
 The BJP and the Congress, who have satisfied the third and fourth positions respectively in the last assembly elections, have prepared to go full throttle in these elections
 chunki pradesh kii do mukhya partiyaan sattarudh samaajawaadee party (sapa) or mukhya vipakshi dal bahujan samaaj party (basapa) sidhe taur par chunaav maidan main nahin hai, aise main yah chunaav mukhya rup se bhaajapa, congress or kuch choti partiyon ke bich simatata dikh rahaa he
 As soon as the notification of the local body elections, which had been hanging for a year, was issued, Mazma started gathering in the offices of BJP and Congress
 24 june se 7 july tak chaar charnon main pradesh ke 12 nagar nigam, 184 nagarpalika parishadon or 404 nagar panchayaton main hone vaale chunaavon ke liye in donon partiyon main hi sabase zyada sakriyata dikhaai de rahi he
 However, BJP has the highest stakes among them
 20 karod kii aabaadi vaale uttar pradesh kii 22 fisadi janata shahari ilaakon main rahati he, jahaan beete nikaay chunaav tak bhaajapa kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 In the 2006 civic elections, BJP swept eight of the 12 municipal corporations
 bhaajapa se ummiden hai, lekin uski samasya ab bhi vahi he, jo vidhansabha chunaav ke samay thi
 Senior party leaders say that once again the defeated mlas are vying to get tickets to their supporters
 lakhanu main yah hode sabase zyada he
 For the first time in the last 20 years, the BJP performed poorly in the urban areas of Lucknow
 is baar in ilaakon se bhaajapa ke paas keval ek hi vidhayak he, jabaki pehle yah sankhya chaar yaa isse adhik hoti thi
 The state president of the party, Dr
 lakshmikant vaajapeyi bataate hai ki parshad, adhyaksh or meyar ke liye jila or mahanagar cameti se hi teen naam mangaaye jaaenge
 One of these will be selected at the state headquarters
 vaajapeyi kehete hai, ''koi naam pradesh str se joda nahin jayega
 On the other hand, the challenges before the Congress are also not less
 vidhansabha chunaav main duusari partiyon se aae ummidavaaron ko khaasi tavajjo di gai thi or ise hi haar kaa kaaran bhi mana gaya
 But in this election, the Congress is in a mood to repeat the same mistake again
 vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad sanghathanaatmak str par koi parivartan nahin kiya gaya he
 State President Rita Bahuguna Joshi has already offered resignation to the central leadership
 party ke ek bade netaa bataate hai ki nikaay chunaavon main party kisi bhi ummidavaar ko aarthik madad nahin degi
 In such a situation, the biggest crisis facing the party, especially for the post of mayor, is the candidates who are jitau and bear the expenses of the election themselves
 congress ne ummidavaaron ke chayan kaa adhikaar jila shahar congress cametiyon ko saunp diya he
 On what basis is the party hoping for better performance? In response, Rita says, "the SP government in the state has proved to be a failure in issues like law and order
 iskaa phayda congress ko hi milegaa
 "but the recent increase in the price of petrol has increased the resentment of Congress in urban areas
 sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bhale hi chote dalon kii daal na gali ho, lekin is baar phir ralod, apana dal, pis party, communist party jaise dal taal thonkane ko taiyaar khadey hai
 Legislators won from urban seats of all parties in local body elections will also be tested
 shahari vidhayakon kii sankhya ke hisaab se sapa awwal he
 Of the 224 mlas of the party, 45 have been elected from urban areas
 vidhansabha sadasyon kii sankhya ke hisaab se basapa bhale hi pradesh main duusare number kii party ho, lekin iske shahari vidhayakon kii sankhya bhaajapa se kam he
 Out of the total 47 mlas of BJP, 27 have been elected from urban seats, while the BSP with 80 mlas has only 18 mlas from urban areas
 congress or rashtriya lokdal (ralod) ke paas kramshah 9 or 2 shahari vidhayak hai
 However, in the last assembly elections, the SP performed well in urban seats
 iske baavjood party loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle koi chunaav ladakar apni urja nasht nahin hone dena chaahati
 But the SP has allowed its workers to contest the election as an independent candidate, but no one will be able to use the party symbol
 sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary bataate hai, ''nikaay chunaav ladane vaale kisi bhi sapa kaaryakarta ko party ko jaankaree dene kii jarurat nahin he
 Like the SP, the BSP will contest the civic elections indirectly
 2006 main hue chunaavon kaa basapa ne bahishkaar kiya tha or mayawati ne is baar bhi nikaay chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 In the last 10 years, the BSP has also made its base in urban areas
 aise main mayawati ke faisle se shahari ilaakon main basapa kaaryakartaaon ko khaasi niraashaa hui thi
 So this time, in the wake of Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati finally had to change her decision due to maintaining the organization
 basapa kaaryakarta bhi ab nikaay chunaav to ladenge, lekin party inhen apana chunaav chinh nahin degi or na hi ye mayawati yaa kanshiram ke chitra kaa prayog kar sakenge
 Senior BJP leader Vijay Bahadur Pathak says that the SP and BSP have never had any mass base in urban areas and both these parties are fighting it indirectly to avoid confusion in the civic elections

 ) Sukhbir Badal keeps all his cards very carefully
 apni pasand ke kisi bhi netaa ko ve apni party main le aa sakate hai
 "punjab Congress President Pratap Singh Bajwa is saying this
 jahiraa taur par ve aajkal behaal or pareshaan dikhaai dete hai
 He is the same Bajwa, who was specially selected by Rahul Gandhi in March to play a historic second innings in a party facing the political stage
 bajva kii is hataasha kii vajah he congress netaaon kaa ek-ek kar akali dal kii raah lenaa
 Sukhbir has taken such leaders into his court as a planned strategy
 is tarah se party par dhili hoti bajva kii pakad unhen pareshaan kar rahi he
 On the afternoon of 30 October, 82-year-old Avatar Singh Brar, the oldest and most well-known face of the Congress, traveled from the south-west part of Faridkot to Sector-27 of Chandigarh, and in one of the illustrious headquarters dressed in the corporate style of the Shiromani Akali Dal Arrived for a different kind of photograph
 ek congressi ke rup main unhone beant singh kii sarkaar ke samay bataur mantri 1992 se 1997 tak kaam kiya or akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke sadsy rahe
 After working as a Congressman for 40 years, this senior leader had now decided to change his face
 shiromani akali dal ke sabase yuva adhyaksh or punjab ke up-mukhyamantri sukhbir badal kii bagal main photo khinchvaane ke liye muskaan bhare chehre ke saath khadey baraar un congress netaaon kii line main judye vaala ek or naam hai jinhen congress chhodie kaa koi malaal nahin
 Soon after his resounding victory in the February 2012 assembly election, Sukhbir did not miss a single opportunity to weaken his political rivals
 patiala loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra main kendriya mantri pranit cor ke sabase bharosemand sahyogi punjab or haryana hycourt ke senior vakil 52 varshiya deepinder singh dhillon un pehle congressiyon main se hai jinhone 5 july, 2012 ko naaraaz hokar party chhod di thi
 He complained that he had not been given a ticket in three consecutive assembly elections since 2002
 unki naaraazgi bhaanpate hue badal parivaar or sukhbir ke bahanoi bikram majithia ne dhillon ko apane ghar bulaakar unase baatcheet kii or unhen apni party main shaamil hone ke liye lubhaa liya
 He expresses his gratitude to him, saying, "badal sahib, Sukhbir and Bikramji as the top leadership of the Akali Dal personally invited me to join the party
" ”patiala jila yojana board ke adhyaksh dhillon ko ab bataate hai, 2014 ke aam chunaav main unki beete dinon kii maardarshak (cor) ke khilaaf utaarne ke liye taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 This exercise to woo Congress leaders is, in Sukhbir's own words, part of a well-conceived strategy
 iske jariye ve aise netaaon ko party main laane kii koshish kar rahe hai, jinka ki party vishesh se itar khud kaa bhi apana janaadhar he
 "as the Akali Dal president, this is an important part of my long-term plan to strengthen our party," he tells India Today
 ” akali dal ke kaamkaaj ko varshon se najadik se dekhte aae ek rajnatik vishleshak or punjabi patrkaar balajit singh bhi kehete hai, ''ye dal-badal ek sadhi hui yojana kaa hissaa hai
 "sukhbir says that he can go to any extent to win an opponent," i told the people of my team two months ago that Ajit Singh Shant, the leader of Nihal Singh Wala, needs me with him
 teen din baad ve akali dal ke sadsy ban chuke the
 Sukhbir further adds that with the addition of former Congress MLA Shanta, the Akali Dal's weak base in Moga district has become stronger
 unka kahana he ki har netaa ''apane ilaake main arjeet kii gai varshon kii saakh ke saath-saath apane samarthakon ko bhi to lekar aata he
 "in this way, they are incapacitating the already weak opposition by snatching away the leaders
 bajva bhi maanate hai ki is tarah se machi bhagdad party kaa manobal todgaye vaali he
 In a sarcastic tongue, he says, "people are leaving the party because they have started questioning the future of Congress because of being in opposition for two consecutive terms
" lekin rajnatik dalon par jab bura vakt aata he to aisi baaten hameshaa hoti hai
 "congress chief Bajwa regrets that these leaders are leaving the party" for a car with a red light and a few gunmen "
 purv mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh bhi maanate hai ki dalbadaluon kii vajah se punjab main congress kamjor ho rahi he
 However, he is confident that "due to the failure of the akali-bjp government to deliver good governance, the Congress workers and its voters will return to its camp before the next Lok Sabha elections
" ”par philhal halaat khaase niraashajanak dikh rahe hai
 The constant exodus of the leaders from the party is a cause for concern, Bajwa himself has no legal trouble in two cases, but the legal grievance by the state administration
 un par 2012 main chandigarh ke aasapaas gram panchayat kii jameen avaidh rup se hathiyaane kaa aarope he
 The second and more serious charge against him is related to the irregularities in the purchase of asphalt worth crores of rupees between 2002 and 2007 during his tenure as Minister of Public Works Department
 sukhbir ne bhi is maamle main jaanch kii pushti kii he
 Bajwa publicly denied the first charge, but has not said anything yet on the 'asphalt scam'
 bajva apni hi party ke andar ubhar rahe kade virodh kii vajah se bhi alag-thalag padate ja rahe hai
 He is constantly persecuted for his removal from the post of state party president
 kisi kaa naam liye bagaiyr ve kehete hai, ''party ke kai varisht netaa chaahate hai ki main naakaam ho jaaun, jisase ki ve 2014 ke chunaavon ke najadik aate-aate kursi hasil kar len
 "he refers to leaders like Amarinder Singh and former Congress Working Committee member Jagmeet Singh Brar
 chandigarh main apane aaleeshaan ghar main baithe sukhbir badal pehle se hi apane agle kadam kii yojana banane main jute gaye hai
 He says, "staying in touch, soon i am going to bring two Congress mlas into my court
" ” ve bhavishyavaanee bhi karte hai, ''2017 main hone vaale agle vidhansabha chunaavon tak congress bas ek party kaa dhaancha bhar banakar rah jaaegi

 dilli kii sieji report main rashan ko lekar badi gadabadi saamne aane ke baad rashan vitaran pranali or rashan card ke banane se lekar usase judi tamaam khamiyaan or bhashtachar ujagar ho gaye hai
 Meanwhile, Aaj Tak took stock of the shops of ration shops in different places to know the ground reality, then it came to know that from the general public to the ration seller, the government and the system are upset
 ajtak kii padtaal mendillike sangam vihaar, gita colony, ambedkar nagar or aanad parbat jaise ilaakon main kai tathy saamne aae
 These facts came out in Aaj Tak's ground report - the most problem is with the machines engaged in rationing
 zyaadaatar mashine anguuthe kaa nishaan nahin leti hai, jiske chalate kai baar logon ko ghanton line main lagane ke baad bhi khaali haath lautnaa padataa he
 Due to the portability of ration shops, people had problems and relief
 isse sabase zyada dikkat rashan vikritaon ko hoti he, kyonki kai baar duusare ilaakon se bhi log rashan lene ke liye aa jate hai, jisase us ilaake ke rahane waalon ke liye rashan kam pad jaataa he or nuksaan ilaake ke logon kaa hota he
 According to those who run ration shops, if ration card holders are properly investigated, then only two-three lakhs of the 16 lakh ration card holders will be found to be correct, the rest are fake
 - sangam vihaar main rashan kii dukaan chalaane vaale atul kaa kahana he ki unki dukaan main kai baar log badi gadiyon se rashan lene pahunchate hai
 There are some people who have two-three-storey houses and their rent is two to two and a half lakh rupees
 aise log ke rashan card banane kii vajah se jaruratmandon ko kai dfa rashan nahin mil paata he
 - If shopkeepers are to be believed, the most rigged ration card maker is from the person who comes for investigation, he also makes money by making money
 dilli main sirf 200 rupee dekar amir se amir vyakti bhi apana rashan card banavaa saktaa he or garib apane haq se vanchit rah jate hai
 - There is also an allegation by the people running ration shops that all are corrupt from the government to the government employees
 chote-chote kaam ke liye tak kamishan lete hai
 Due to bribery, the ration shop owners also used to steal a lot
 par ab POS mashin aane se ghoosekhori or kalabazari kam ho gai he
 What defects did the CAG find in the ration distribution system? - Ration cards are usually made in the name of female members of the household, but in 13 cases the eldest member of the household was found to be under 18 years of age
 12 hajaar 852 maamalon main to gharon main ek bhi mahila sadsy nahin pai gai
 - Out of 207 trains carrying ration goods, 42 were such trains, which were not registered with the Transport Department
 - aath gaadiyaan aisi thim, jinhone 1500 quintal se zyada rashan dhulaai kii, lekin unke registration number bas, tu whealer yaa thri whealer ke paae gaye
 - All ration card holders were to receive alerts on SMS, but in 2,453 cases the numbers came out of ration shopkeepers only
 -rashanse judi samasyaon ko lekar jo kol centre banaaya gaya, unamem saal 2013 se saal 2017 ke bich aae takreeban 16 lakh kol main sirf 42 fisadi kol kaa jawaab diya gaya
 - All officers were to conduct field inspections, but such inspections were not found in the audit
 - 412 rashan card aise paae gaye, jinamein parivaar ke ek sadsy kaa naam hi kai baar likhaa gaya tha
 - Ration is given only to those families who are poor, but more than a thousand cards also included the names of the servants, ie there are consumers who can keep servants
 aise log inakam tex bhi nahin dete hai or na hi inke paas do kilowat se zyada kaa bijli conection he
 Also, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has also made it clear that no one can replace Rahul Gandhi in the Congress
 unhone kaha ki 'yah hamaari party par nirbhar karata he ki ham kiski chunenge, hamaari party main aisa koi vyakti nahin he jo ki rahul ke khilaaf khadaa hona chahta he, yadi koi he to khadey ho jaaen, dekhenge kya hota he

 baithak ke baad aaj tak se sanjay singh ne khaas baatcheet kii
 Sanjay Singh said that Rahul Gandhi has expressed the intention of the alliance by tweeting, but the words of the alliance are not available on Twitter
 'aap' ne congress se baat karne ke liye sanjay singh ko adhikrut kiya he
 Rahul ji should also authorize a person from the Congress who can form a strategy to defeat BJP in all 18 (delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh) seats by sitting with "AAP"

 We do not want to give a single seat to the BJP

 After all, why does Congress want BJP to win 11 seats? ”haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh together have 18 seats
 congress kah rahi he ki inamen 3 siten congress ko jeetne do, 4 seat “aap” jeet le or 11 siten bhaajapa ko jeetne den
 We do not want to give a single seat to the BJP

 Rahul Gandhi has expressed his intention by tweeting on his behalf
 rahul gandhi ko samajhnaa chahie kii gathbandhan kii baaten twitor par nahin hoti hai
 Today some things have been decided in the meeting with Arvind Kejriwal
 arvind kejariwal ne saaf kaha ki narendra modi or amit shah kii jodi desh ke samvidhan or is desh ke ganga-jamuna tahazeeb ke liye khatra ban gaye hai
 In such a situation, they will do everything to stop the pair
 congress ko bataanaa he ki unki ore se koun baatcheet karegaa
 Further Sanjay Singh said that Arvind Kejriwal has officially appointed me to talk to the Congress
 ab congress ko tay karnaa he ki koun unki taraf se gathbandhan par baatcheet karegaa
 Apart from this, Sanjay Singh was asked whether the Aam Aadmi Party has sent any proposal to the Congress? He said in response that there was a proposal for talks on behalf of the Congress yesterday, now they have to decide
 aam aadmi party baatcheet ke liye taiyaar haisanjay singh ne aage kaha ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye har sambhav prayaas karenge, lekin bijepi tabhi rukegi jab uski loksabhaa seat ke number kam kiye jaaen
 If Aam Aadmi Party, JJP and Congress combine from Haryana to Delhi, then the clear message will be that Narendra Modi will not come to power
 isliye ham congress se baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 When Sanjay Singh was asked if the Aam Aadmi Party's demand for a seat in Haryana will not worsen the alliance issue? To this, Sanjay Singh gave a roundly answer, saying how will it get stuck, how will it go wrong
 itani baat rahul gandhi ko samaj nahin aati he ki haryana main bhi bijepi ko roka ja saktaa he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The Taj Mahal has been in the limelight for the last few days
 kuch din pehle jab uttar pradesh sarkaar kii paryaton gantavyon kii bocolate jari hui thi us vakt usamen tajmahal kaa zikr naa hona sabko akhra tha
 Now on Monday, some Hindu Yuva Vahini activists held Shiva Chalisa outside the Taj Mahal, after which the controversy has been heated
 mohabbat kii nishaani tajmahal vishwa ke saat ajoobon main shaamil he
 However, there is one more thing related to the Taj Mahal that only few people know
 aisi manyata he ki tajmahal kaa nirmaan shahjahan ne apni patni mumtaj kii yaad main karavaaya tha
 Read one such anecdote related to Mumtaz and Taj
 
 
 burhanpur main hui thi mumtaj kii moutamumtaj ne burhanpur ke shahi mahal main 17 june 1631 ko antim saans lee thi
 Mumtaz died during the birth of his fourteenth child
 shahjahan banvaanaa chaahate the yaadgaar imaratabataya jaataa he ki shahjahan mumtaj se beintahaan mohabbat karte the isiilie unki yaad main ek bhavy imaarat banvaanaa chaahate the
 However, this was not possible in Burhanpur, so Mumtaz's body was kept in Burhanpur for six months and 9 days by applying mudpack therapy ie Multani soil
 or baad main agra le jaaya gaya
 This was the biggest problem
according to historians, a place was chosen on the banks of Tapti in Burhanpur for the construction of the Taj
 lekin mitti main dimak hone ke chalate yah yojana aage nahin bad saki kyonki tajmahal kii neenv main istemaal hone vaali lakdi ko dimak se khatra tha
 For this reason, the Taj was built on the banks of the Yamuna
 lakdi kii he taj kii neenvamedia reports ke mutabik agra main tajmahal ke base ke liye jameen main 50 feet tak khudaai karai gai
 After excavation, the pillars of rosewood and teak wood were prepared
 agra main isi tarah 110 pilron par tajmahal kii aadharshila rakhi he
 Even after hundreds of years on the base of sheesham-teak, the Taj Mahal still stands

 jaankaree ke mutabik vidhansabha ke andar pravesh karne ke liye tej pratap yadav ke nijee surakshakarmiyon ke paas koi paas bhi maujuud nahin tha
 In such a situation, the question arises that how did the security personnel of Tej Pratap Yadav pass by without being able to enter the assembly? The fault of this security was blamed on the Bihar Police
 is puri ghatana ko lekar jab tej pratap yadav se sawaal poocha gaya to vah media par hi bhadak gaye or kaha ki unke upar jaan kaa khatra he
 He accused the Bihar government of not providing him with government protection and then pleaded with the media to provide him proper security
 vidhansabha kii suraksha ko lekar bhi tej pratap yadav ne kaha ki vahaan sab kuch bhagwaan bharose he
 Regarding this joke in security, Patna SSP Garima Malik has said that how Tej Pratap Yadav entered inside the assembly premises with personal security personnel is being investigated and action will be taken against whichever officer is found guilty

 Actually, the central government wants to implement GST across the country from July 1, but before that questions have also been raised about the rates of GST in different states

 Recently, Sisodia convened a meeting of traders of Delhi, in which the traders of different industries had put their demands in front of GST tax

 On the question of the Chief Ministerial candidate, party general secretary Ashok Gehlot said on Monday that the game has not started yet, the game will start now
 aage aage dekhie kya hota he, game to ab shuru hoga
 Gehlot was asked the question who will become the Chief Minister of Rajasthan? Gehlot had earlier said in response to this question that if someone goes to play a game in the game of a millionaire, then where does he know who will become a millionaire
 ye to aakhri sawaal main pataa chalata he ki karodpati koun banegaa
 Randeep Singh Surjewala called it Dhoni's helicopter shot of Ashok Gehlot
 isi baat ko jaipur main doharaate hue kaha ki abhi to khel shuru hi nahin hua he
 See what happens when the game starts
 gahalot kii is baat ko lekar raajnneetik galiyare main charchaa behad garm he
 It is believed that Gehlot strongly expressed his claim for the post of Chief Minister in gestures
 payalat or gahalot main is baat ko lekar andar khaane mahabharat machi he ki vidhansabha main ummidavaaron kaa tikat koun baantega
 It is believed that the decision of who will become the chief minister of both will be in the final round and it may be decided in the meeting of the legislature party
 isse pehle donon hi rajya kii janata or congress ke kaaryakartaaon ko sandesh dena chaahate hai ki wo congress main majboot sthiti main hai or unke samarthak niraash nahi hon
 Gehlot is a leader who measures and weighs a lot
 jis tarah se unhone yah baat kahi he, usase mana ja rahaa he ki apane samarthakon main ek sandesh dena chaahate hai ki bhale hi vah dilli chale gaye hai, lekin siem pad kii daavedaari main hai
 On the other hand, Sachin Pilot, who has been commanding the Congress continuously for the last 5 years, is hopeful that his struggle will definitely be rewarded
 sachin payalat jis tarah serahul gandhike saath sahaj dikhte hai use lekar rajasthan main charchaa kaa vishay he, agar congress jiti to mukhyamantri payalat ho sakate hai
 While the announcement of seats in the Grand Alliance was announced, the absence of big leaders has raised many questions
 mahagathbandhan ke press conference main bade chehron ke nadaarad rahane kii vajah se aisa lagata he ki bhale hi sankhya kaa faisla ho gaya ho lekin koun kahaan se ladega isko lekar abhi bhi pech fansaa hua he
 However, the leaders of the Grand Alliance are also waiting to see from which places the NDA fielded candidates
 uske baad faisla shaayad unke liye aasaan ho jaae, lekin philhal to mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ke bich baithkon kaa daur siton ke elaan ke baad bhi jari he
 However, all efforts have been made to appease the smaller parties in the grand alliance
 upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party ko 5 siten, jeethanram maanjhi kii ham party ko 3 siton ke saath navada vidhansabha ke upachunaav kaa tikat bhi mila he
 Mukesh Sahni's VIP party has got 3 seats, while Sharad Yadav's Democratic Janata Dal has been given a ticket to Madhepura to merge with RJD
 left ke naam par maale ko 1 seat par argedy ne samarthan diya he
 Male has already announced Raju Yadav's name from there
 9 siton ke saath khush nahin congressargedy 20 siton par lard rahi he jo ki pehle se tay tha ki wo 20 se kam siton par chunaav nahin ladegi or vahi hua
 However, it also includes Sharad Yadav who was seeking 2 tickets for his party
 lekin unki party kaa vilay argedy main ho gaya
 On the other hand, the Congress which wanted to contest 11 seats has been given only 9 seats
 halaki, ek rajyasabha kii seat dene kaa vaada bhi kiya gaya he
 Despite this, the Congress was not happy
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh madan mohan jha ke chehre par khushi nahin dikhaai de rahi thi
 Because Darbhanga seat is still stuck for Kirti Azad
 yahaan mukesh sahani apana daawa abhi tak nahin chhod rahen hai, teen siton main se mukesh sahani kii party ke liye khagadiya or mujffarpur seat to tay he lekin darbhanga abhi bhi lataka hua he
 Meeting of Rabri's house: About 2 hours before the mahagathbandhan press conference, a meeting of senior leaders of all mahagathbandhan was convened at 10 circular road, Rabri Devi's residence, but the decision could not be made by 4 pm, then a change in strategy, state level leaders Was sent for a press conference
 conference main keval argedy ke rajyasabha saansad manoj jha or pradesh adhyaksh ramachandra purve hi bole, jabaki madan mohan jha chupchaap baithe rahe
 Here, the meeting of the Grand Alliance leaders in the 10 circulars continued till late evening
 lekin baat bani nahin, sabhi netaa ek ek kar nikal gaye
 It is believed that there is a screw up in the grand alliance regarding Valmikinagar, Motihari, Darbhanga, Madhubani and Katihar
 valmikinagar par congress or araspi donon kaa daawa he, motihaari par araspi argedy kaa daawa he
 Mukesh Sahni and Kirti Azad claim Darbhanga
 katihaar main tarik anwar ko lekar sawaal hai
 So in Madhubani, the matter is stuck between the Congress and the RJD
 halaki, gathbandhan ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki ek-do dinon main yah masalaa sulajhaa liya jayega
 'new formula to contest candidates' The 3 seats Manjhi has got include Gaya, Aurangabad and Nalanda
 aurangabad ko lekar congress main baari virodh he
 Nikhil Kumar's ticket was severely opposed by the Congress at Sadakat Ashram
 aurangabad se ham party ke ummidavaar upendra prasad honge jo jediu ke emelsi hai
 However, regarding the seat-sharing in the alliance, it is being said clearly that RJD has done the same
 frontroot par khilne vaali congress ab baikfoot par dikh rahi he
 The Congress also had to overcome small parties in the greed of the coalition
 ab ye formula diya ja rahaa he ki koi bhi dal apane achche ummidavaaron ko duusare dal ke tikat par ladava saktaa he or iske liye argedy sahyog karegi
 Obviously, this formula of seats has given sleep to many veterans

 The Koiri, Kurmi and EBC Dhanuk castes are considered a major vote bank

 The Mahagathbandhan is in the process of getting these votes by the RLSP

 html ye lok parv kaha jaataa he
 In Purvanchal and Bihar, people essentially celebrate Chhath
 is din sabhi log apane gharon main ikattha hote hai
 Celebrities like lalu-rabidi also celebrate this festival
 chhath parv ke bare main yah dharna heki yah mukhya rup se biharvasiyon kaa parv he
 The reason behind this is that the beginning of this festival is believed to be from Angaraja Karna
 ang pradesh vartmaan bhagalpur he jo bihar main sthit he
 There is a story about Anga Raj Karna that he is the child of Kunti and Surya Dev, the mother of Pandavas
 karn apana aradhy dev surya dev ko maanate the
 This rule used to worship the Sun God in the water till the waist and at that time he also donated to the needy
 mana jaataa he ki karthik shukla shashthee or saptami ke din karn surya dev kii vishesh puja kiya karata the
 Impressed by his king's devotion to the sun, the residents of Ang country started worshiping the sun god
 dhire-dhire surya puja kaa vistaar puure bihar or purvanchal kshetra tak ho gaya
 In ancient times it was celebrated only in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 lekin aaj is praant ke log vishwa main jahaan bhi rahete hai vahaan is parv ko usee shraddha or bhakthi se manaate hai
 This story is also another mythological story about the prevalent scripture that Vedmata Gayatri was born between the sunset of Kartik Shukla Paksha Shashthi and sunrise of Saptami
 prakruti ke shashth ansh se utpann shashthee mata baalkon kii raksha karne vaale vishnu bhagwaan dwaara rachi maaya hai
 On the sixth day after the birth of the child, the sixth maiya is worshiped, so that the furious planets of the children are pacified and there is no suffering in life
 isliye is tithi ko shashthee devi kaa vrath hone laga
