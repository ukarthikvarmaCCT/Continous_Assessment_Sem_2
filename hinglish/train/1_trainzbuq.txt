 The court directed Jaganmohan not to leave Hyderabad without the permission of the court and neither directly or indirectly influence any witness
 iske saath hi unhen maamle kii kaarywahi ke dauraan adaalat ke samaksh upasthit rahane ko bhi kaha gaya he
 The court said that if Jaganmohan violates these conditions, the CBI can seek cancellation of his bail
 yah maamla jaganmohan kii companiyon main vibhinn companiyon ke nivesh se sambandhit he jo unke pita wies rajasekhar reddy ke mukhyamantritv kaal ke dauraan anya laabh lene ke uddeshy se kiye gaye the
 Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh between 2004 and 2009

 Though the movement is getting wide support, till now there has been a lack of popular leader and Jaganmohan can overcome this deficiency
 jaganmohan kii patni bharti or wiesar congress ke kai netaa adaalat kaksh main maujuud the
 Earlier, the CBI had opposed Jaganmohan's bail plea, saying that mps from Kadapa could influence the hearing of the case after coming out on bail
 jaganmohan ne jamaanat yachika main daleel di thi ki andhra pradesh ko vibhajit kiye jane ko lekar tateey andhra or roilseema main chal rahe andolan ke maddenjar unke liye jaruri he ki ve logon ke saath rahen or ek raajnneetik dal ke netaa ke rup main andolan kii aguwai karen
 The principal investigating agency has so far filed 10 charge sheets against Jaganmohan in the high property case
 aakhri do aaropapatr 17 sitambar ko daakhil kiye gaye the
 BCCI chief and India Cements vice-president and managing director n Srinivasan, Dalmia Cements vice-president Punit Dalmia, Arabindo Ferma vice-president Nityananda Reddy, Ramki Infra chairman a Dasaradharami Reddy and Nimmagadda Prasad are also accused

 Industrialist Nimmagadda has been in Chanchalguda jail since his arrest
 venkat raaman raav ko swasthya sambandhi kaarnon se antarim jamaanat mil chuki he
 Jaganmohan had filed a petition for bail on September 11 and contended that the Supreme Court had given the CBI four months to complete the investigation and it was completed on September 9
 jaganmohan giraftaar ke baad 27 may 2012 se yahaan chanchalguda central jail main band hai
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had on 5 October 2012 and on 9 May this year dismissed Jagan Mohan's bail petitions
 is bich, jaganmohan kii rihaai ko unki viares congress party ke liye manobal badhaane vaala ghatnakram kaha ja rahaa he
 His release tomorrow will not only give new energy to the party but will also bring a new twist in the politics of Andhra Pradesh at a time when there are agitations on the issue of partition in the state
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki nishchit rup se jaganmohan vartmaan raajnneetik paridrishy main tateey andhra-roilseema kshetra main nirvivaad netaa ke rup main ubharenge kyonki viares congress pehle hi ekikrut rajya kaa paksh le chuki he
 There is a strong movement for a unified state but there is a lack of effective leader in Seemandhra region
 raajnneetik vishleshkon ke anusaar, jaganmohan yah kami dur kar sakate hai
 However, Jagan will first have to resolve some internal issues related to his party
 ekikrut andhrapradesh kaa paksh lekar wiesar congress telugana kshetra main bahut kamjor ho chuki he
 The party is not in a strong position in many districts of Seemandhra region due to infighting
 iske alaava jaganmohan kareeb 16 maah se jail main the or is dauraan unki party ek tarah se netritv viheen thi
 However his mother YS Vijaya and younger sister Sharmila tried to shoulder the responsibility of the party

 On Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal compared Delhi to Jungle Raj, citing deteriorating law and order in the country's capital
 is bich apane twit se arvind kejariwal uparajyapal or pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa sadhana nahin bhuule
 Talking about Jungle Raj through tweet, Delhi has the rule of the Aam Aadmi Party with 67 mlas, but Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwalka, who made many promises of security before the election, says that Jungle Raj is spread in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ne haal hi main hui ek vaardaat par twit karte hue likhaa
 Complete jungle raj in Del
 LG / Modi ji failed miserably
 What hv they done to control deteriorating law n order? Https: / / t
 co / 7l8uszvwzq— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)june 6, 2016LG or piem modi par nishanise twit ke baadaam aadmi partisarkaar ke mantri or netaaon ko jaise centre sarkaar or uparajyapal par nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka mil gaya
 Satyendar Jain, Home Minister of Delhi Government, is accusing the Central Government of not holding a review meeting of Law and Order
 dilli ke liye centre ke paas vakt nahingrih mantri satyendra jain ne kaha, 'jangalrajkaho yaa modi raaj kaho baat to ek hi he, samay unke paas he nahin
 Police is under the center and give Modi for 1 hour in a month, the Home Minister of India met for 2 hours every day, till today he has met many people about the problem of Delhi
 thana cameti ko LG ne khatm kar diya, lau and order kii sthiti bhi rivyuu nahin kar sakate
 In fact, the Aam Aadmi Party singing the song of Jungle Raj had made many such election promises
 jaaniye kejariwal sarkaar ne in vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye kya kiya or kya nahin kiya
 1
 dark spot dur karne kaa vaadadillike aise kai ilaake hai jahaan street lite band hone se andhera rahata he, lekin dark spot ko thik karne ke liye sarkaar report taiyaar karne ke alaava, kuch thos kadam nahin uthaa pai he
 2
 last mil connactivity majboot karne kaa vaadakhud arvind kejariwal or parivahan mantri gopal raay dilli kii parivahan vyavastha ko kamjor bataa chuke hai, jabaki last mil connactivity dene main sarkaar ab tak vifal sabit hui he
 3
 puure shahar or bason main CCTV lagane kaa vaadasarkaar dilli shahar ko CCTV se las karne ke liye kai nitiyon par charchaa to kar rahi he, lekin jamini str par CCTV kaa vaada puraa nahin kar pai he
 However, many DTC buses have CCTV as pilot project
 4
 Keeping in view the safety of women under the responsibility of Mahila Suraksha Dal, Aam Aadmi Party had promised to deploy 10,000 Mahila Suraksha Dal, but so far it has not been completed
 ditisi bason main bina hathiyaar ke purush homegord jarur tainaat kiye gaye hai
 5
 suraksha batan kaa vaadaek aise batan kaa vaada, jise dabaate hi mahila ke aasapaas ho rahi vaardaat yaa ghatana kii jaankaree najdiki police stesan yaa pisiar tak pahunchaai ja sakegi
 This claim of the government is suffering a quarrel with the Center
 philhal virdohi arvind kejariwal ko is twit kii yaad dil rahe hai, jisamen kejariwal ne 2013 main mukhyamantri shila dikshit ko besahaara bataaya tha
 However, if it is about security and law and order, then many questions also arise on the Aam Aadmi Party government
 kya modi sarkaar ne ek aisa kanoon banaaya he, jiske tahat adivaasiyon ko goli maari ja sakati he? sunne main yah baat hairaan karne vaali lagati he, lekin soshal media par teji se viral ho rahe ek video main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi thik yahi kehete sunai de rahe hai
 Many people are reacting angrily to his statement
 bijepi iti vibhaag ke pramukh amit malviya ne to is bayaan ke liye rahul gandhi ko adatan jhooth bolne vaala bataaya
 Rahul Gandhi is a congenital LIAR! Can you imagine anyone else speaking such lies and getting away with it? No fact check on Rahul Gandhi's speeches, no outrage either
 
 
 This subservience to the family is frankly worrying
 But trust the people of India to reject such bigotry

 com / w9srj9wh9p— Chowkidar Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya)april 27, 2019fasebuk pej India Unravelled par rahul gandhi ko jhootha bataate hue jab ye video clip daali gai, to use dekhte hi dekhte hajaaron logon ne share kar diya
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that this statement of Rahul Gandhi is misleading, because he introduced the sections under consideration for amendment of a law in a more straightforward manner, which deceives the perceiver
 It is possible
 haalanki rahul gandhi kii baat ko saraasar jhooth bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki jis indian forest act 1927 kanoon kii baat wo kar rahe hai, usamen vyapak badlaav karne ke liye sachmuch sarkaar ne kadam uthaaya he or nae praavdhaanon ke tahat van adhikariyon ko goli chalaane kaa adhikaar die jane kii baat bhi kahi gai he
 The video clip of Congress President Rahul Gandhi going viral has been taken from a speech given by him on April 23 in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh
 yepura bhaashan congress party ke utyub channel paraupalabdh he
 Shahdol is one such area of madhya Pradesh, which has a significant population of tribals
 yahaan 29 april ko matdaan hua tha
 Rahul Gandhi in the last of his speech while talking about the rights of tribals, says, 'now Narendra Modi has enacted a new law
 adivaasiyon ke liye ek nayaa kanoon banaaya he, jisamen ek line likhi he ki adivaasiyon ko goli maari ja sakegi
 It is written in the law that the tribals will be attacked
 aapaki jameen chhinakar jangal lete hai, jal lete hai or phir kehete hai ki adivaasiyon ko goli maari ja sakati he
 'A draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act 1927, which Rahul Gandhi is referring to, was prepared by the government earlier this year
 7 march ko kanoon main sanshodhan kaa ye masauda paryaavaran mantralay ne sabhi rajyon ko bheja or unase kaha ki is bare main vichaar-vimarsh karke apni raay 7 june 2019 tak kendra sarkaar ko bhejein
 For the amendment of the Forest Act, which 123-page Jomsoudasarkar has prepared
 isamen forest officers ko aise tamaam adhikaar die gaye hai, jo unke paas pehle kabhi nahin the or jisase wo kanoonee rup se kaaphi taaqatvar ho jaaenge
 According to a report by Business Standard, the new draft states that many such crimes, which are currently in the category of bailable offenses, have been made non-bailable
 itnaa hi nahin, ye bhi kaha gaya he ki kai aparaadh aise hai, jinamein khud ko nirdosh sabit karne kii zimmedaari aaropee kii hogi or jab tak wo aisa sabit nahin kar de, use doshi hi mana jayega
 In this draft, on page number 84 (point number 66), the right to shoot officers is written
 isamen kaha gaya he ki kanoon main ek nayaa praavdhaan shaamil kiya ja rahaa he, jiske mutabik agar forest act 1927 yaa vanya jeev sangrakshan kanoon 1927 ke tahat kisi aparaadh ko rokane ke liye yaa phir kisi apradhi ko pakadaney ke liye jarurat hui, to van adhikari bandook kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 Taking care that the damage is minimized
 'masaude main ye bhi likhaa he ki aparaadh ko rokane ke liye kii gai aisi karrvaai ke liye us adhikari ke khilaaf bina rajya sarkaar kii manjuuri ke mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja sakegaa
 However, to amend the law, all these things have been said only in the draft, about which the state governments have been asked to discuss and send their views
 kanoon main ye prastaav tabhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jab ye praavdhaan sansad ke donon sadanon se paas ho
 Pass in the standing committee of Parliament and then it should also have the approval of the President
 aisa ho paaegaa yaa nahin, ye abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Therefore, the claim made by Rahul Gandhi that the Modi government has made a law under which the tribals can be shot
 
 
 puri tarah thik nahin he

 There are only a few days left in Republic Day, preparations are going on in full swing across the country
 deshbhar main suraksha bhi badha di gai he
 Meanwhile, Darul Uloom of Deoband in Uttar Pradesh has issued a directive before Republic Day
 daarul ulum kaa kahana he ki sabhi chaatr ganatantr diwas ke maukey par trainon main safar karne se bachein
 This instruction has been issued by the hostel in-charge of Darul Uloom
 apane nirdesh main daarul ulum ne nirdesh diya he ki ganatantr diwas ke maukey par chaatr train main safar karne se bachein, kyonki lagaataar checking hoti he jisase bevajaah kii pareshaani uthaani pad sakati he
 Which can create an atmosphere of fear, so avoid traveling in the train
 is nirdesh main chaatro ko kaha gaya he ki vah train main kisi tarah kii bahes karne se bhi bachein, taaki mudda naa garmaae

 aise main khubasurat dikhne ke liye ladkiyaan aajkal vajinal surgery kaa sahaara le rahi hai
 According to a plastic surgeon, the number of girls who have undergone surgery for designer Vajina has increased considerably in the recent past
 vajinal surgery karaane waalon main16 saal kii ladki se lekar 70 saal kii mahilaayeintak shaamil hai
 Usually these girls and women demand that the shape and form of their genitals be changed after doing cosmetic surgery
 surgery guptang ke upree hisse yaa aap kah sakati hai ki sabase bahari bhaag par kii jaati he
 But the question arises as to why is vagina surgery needed? According to Dr
 Ahmed Ismail, a gynecologist in the UK, every vagina has its own shape and it suits every woman
 agar aapako guptang main kisi prakaar kaa dard yaa takalif nahin he to ye bilkul sahi he or aapako kisi bhi tarah kii surgery kii jarurat nahin he
 There is news and celebrations in the media for this sudden change in women
 inhen kii vajah se ab mahilaayein is tarah kii surgery ko jaruri samajhane lagi hai
 They are beginning to think that they can become beautiful only after having surgery
 sabase badi samasya to ye he ki ve apane privet parts kii tulana duusari mahilaon ke saath karti he
 Ismail says that many women come to him who ask him if his genitals are normal
 ismail kehete hai ki aisa poochne vaali mahilaon se main kahata hum ki parfect looking vajaina jaisi koi cheez he hi nahin
 Every woman's body is different
 koi bhi ang ek aakaar, ek rup, ek rang kaa nahin ho saktaa he or angon ke sandarbh main adarsh ang jaisi koi baat ho hi nahin sakati
 This is applicable to all parts of the body and the weight is no different
 ismail kehete hai ki agar aapke vajaina main dard yaa kisi tarah kii takalif nahin he to aapkaavjina ekadam saamaanya he
 In this case, it is wrong to compare anyone
 bas aapako apane guptangon ko saaf or swasth rakhana hota he
 According to Ismail, Vajina, like all body parts, changes with age
 uskaa aakaar or rang umr ke saath badal saktaa he, aise main darane kii yaa chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Looking at the increasing demand for designer Vazina surgery, Ismail says that labiaplasty is not important
 sabase jaruri he ki aapke ang saaf or swasth rahen

 Cricket players of Uttarakhand origin are making a splash all over the country, but despite this, the infrastructure of cricket has not been able to stand here till date

 The state does not even have a recognized association of cricket
 isliye uttarakhand kii team ranjai trophy jaisi cricket siries tak main bhaag lene se vanchit he
 BCCI officials have been visiting Uttarakhand for a long time and are convinced, but this is nothing more than aerial promises
 mahendra singh dhoni mul rup se almoda jile ke lwaali gaanv ke hai to piyush pandey bageshwar or unmukt chand pithauragarh se taalluk rakhte hai
 Pawan Suyal from here known as Garhwal Express plays for Ranji from Delhi and Rabin Bisht from Rajasthan

 Everyone has to run their own shop and all are obstructing the bcci's association with the state association
 natijatan yahaan cricket association kii manyata siyasat kii bhent chadh gai he
 Despite all this, the cricket-loving players of the state have not given up
 unka sangharsh jari he or rajya ke yuvaaon kii cricket ke prati deewangi saaf najar aati he
 Let us know about the plains, if you see any sport even on the mountains, then it is cricket
 cricket ke liye yahaan logon ke junun kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kai baar doordaraj kshetron main yojit sthaneey cricket pratiyogitaaon main bhaag lene vaali tiimon kii sankhya 100 ke aankde ko paar kar jaati he
 Presently, more than 20 players of the state are playing in junior and senior cricket teams from teams of other states
 ladke hi nahin, uttarakhand kii ladkiyaan bhi cricket main naam kama rahi hai
 Ekta Bisht of Almora is a member of the national women's cricket team and is currently playing a series with Australia in Visakhapatnam
 akele punjab kii mahila cricket team main uttarakhand kii chaar ladkiyaan khel rahi hai
 Despite these achievements, why can't the youth here play from the Uttarakhand team? Why are they forced to go to other states to play? Cricket in this state began in 1937 with the formation of the District Cricket Association from Dehradun
 phir yah association pehle dehradun or baad main nainital main gathit kii gai
 The District League of Dehradun has completed 61 years this year, while the Cricket League of Nainital has also been held continuously

 yah sirf bisisiai kii manyata na milane ke kaaran he ki in khilaadiyon ko duusare rajyon se khelnaa pad rahaa he
 Both major associations have a different stand on the question of recognition from the BCCI
 uttarachal cricket association (usie) ke sachiv chandrrkant arya kehete hai ki san 2000 main hamane registration ke saath bisisiai main manyata ke liye aavedan kiya tha jiske baad 2001 main ratnakar shetty, sharad divakar or shivlal yadav kii teen sadasyeey esaliation cameti ne dehradun kaa daura bhi kiya tha
 There was a repeat visit in 2004, but there were differences between the BCCI itself on the question of recognizing the new states
 saath hi vah yah chaahati he ki ham ek duusare association (cricket association of uttarakhand) ko bhi thodaa pratinidhitiv den
 In 2011, the Governing Council of BCCI deferred the matter till September 2012
 arya ko ummid he ki tab tak manyata mil jaaegi
 But on the other hand Secretary of Cricket Association of Uttarakhand P
 si
 Verma says that he spoke directly to Shashank Manohar on the question of recognition, but all this is the excuse of the BCCI
 vah jab chaahegi, tabhi manyata milegi
 The BCCI has already beaten the other four associations of the state
 manyata ke sawaal par 2009 main mumbai or 2010 main dilli main hui baithkon main bhi in donon associationon ko hi bulaayaa gaya
 But UCA believes its claim is stronger
 arya kehete hai, ‘usie iklauti aisi association he, jiske paas puure rajya main apni body he
 We work according to the BCCI guidelines
 ’bisisiai ke kehane par usie ne senior label cricket band kar ab under 14, 16, 19 or 22 par focus karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Arya BCCI also does most of the correspondence with him
 lekin sieyu ke sachiv verma bhi bisisiai ke patr dikhaate hai
 It is clear from this shock that no matter how bright the stars of Uttarakhand are shining in the cricket sky of the world, the recognition of BCCI is still difficult here

 Another board official said, "it was a courtesy call and was scheduled long back

 He was also talked about the cricketing relationship with Pakistan
 unhone kaha pakistan ke saath khilne yaa nahin khilne kaa maamla khel mantralay kaa hi nahin, balki piemo or grih mantralay kaa faisla hoga
 The BCCI signed a memorandum of understanding with the PCB in 2014
 jiske tahat 2015 se 2023 ke bich unhen chah dwipaksheeya siries khelni he

 Farmers are losing their patience in long queues at the doorstep of cooperative societies taking urea

 Politics has become quite hot about this issue

 When the truck arrived, there was only 360 sacks of urea
 parchi dekhne ke baad prati kisaan sirf do bori uria diya gaya
 To distribute a few bags in a crowd of thousands, tokens were distributed from the police station by putting a line of farmers there
 token dikhaane par vyapaaree kii dukaan se uria mila
 The situation is also bad in Katni
 ghantaghar sthit kooparative sosayadi main kisaanon kii lambii qatari he
 One sack of urea is being allocated in one acre
 vahaan mukhya karypalan adhikari dhaniram pandey ne kaha har kisaan ko rakabe ke naam par de rahe hai,ek acre main ek bori
 Farmers are asking for more but are giving according to the stock that is there now
 adivasee bahul jhabua main bhi uria kii baari killat he
 For urea, farmers have to be in line from seven in the morning, yet they are not getting fertilizer
 sinchai ke liye bijli bhi nahin
 Farmer Devi Singh Meda said that he wakes up at six in the morning and comes in the cold
 abhi tak aadhaar card se do bori kii baat thi, kisaan din bhar bhukhe bhatakegaa to sarkaar kya vyavastha kar rahi he? bijli bhi nahin mil rahi
 Shambhu Hatila said, i did not get fertilizer, no work was done
 meraa puraa din barbaad ho gaya
 Babu Katara also has the same complaint, has been standing since seven o'clock, no manure has been received, money is not taken

 During this, they also clashed among themselves
 vahaan uria lene aae sumit raghuvanshi ne kaha khaad lene aae hai
 Some people have been lying for 4 days, are not getting fertilizer, are telling the problem of shortage, but arrangements are bad here

 Someone started climbing on someone's shoulder and took urea, someone started pulling the sacks with both hands, and there was someone who did nothing
 vahaan maujuud sahakaari sosayadi ke manager pawan gupta ne kaha ki teen bori prati kisaan ke hisaab se baant rahe the, lekin aakhir main 60-70 bori bachi thi use kisaanon ne lut liya
 Before the ware house opens in front of the Collectorate in Rajgarh, before the patience of the farmers broke, someone started crossing the gate and someone pushed inside and created a ruckus
 kisaanon ne prashasan par gambhir aarope lagaae
 Farmer Vijay Singh, who came there to get fertilizer, said that we are worried for fertilizer, selling manure from black, cannot be found here

 Farmers also allege that shopkeepers are forcibly selling sulfur, DAP along with urea, urea of rs 268 to Rs 350 to Rs 500 per bag
 sihor ke kisaan dinesh prajapati ne kaha 10 percent uria mila, is baar fasal main bahut dikkat ai
 300 bags are available in 500 in the market
 is jile se us jile janaa pad rahaa he
 Due to 30 to 40 percent more rainfall in Madhya Pradesh, every farmer wants to take more and more Rabi crops for which he needs urea
 rajya ne is vajah se centre sarkaar se rabi sijan ke liye 18 lakh metric ton uria dene kii maang rakhi thi, lekin kaaphi charchaa ke baad bhi do lakh 60 hajaar metric ton maang ghataakar puure sijan ke liye kota 15 lakh 40 hajaar metric ton tay kar diya
 In October there was a demand of 4,25,000 MT, 2,98,000 MT met
 november main 4,50,000 metric ton maange to mila 4 lakh ton
 The Congress is saying that the Center is not helping, while the BJP alleges that the government is lying
 congress ke varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha bahut kami he uria kii
 We have raised this issue with the government
 afsos kii baat he ki jo kendra ko madad karnaa chahie, chaahe kisaan ke mudde hon, uria kii kami ho, har saal ye baat aati he ki rex kaaphi nahin aate hai
 When the issue is raised, there is a line of farmers
 vahiin netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne kaha ki pradesh main 27000 ton uria stock main he
 DAP has 1118 tonnes in stock
 madhyapradesh ke godaamon main maujuud he
 Government of India records are there

 This government did not have to do advance planning
 jaankaar kehete hai ki ek acre genhu kii fasal ke liye ausatan do se dhai bori uria lagata he, yani lagbhag 90 kilo
 If urea is not received on time, the crop is bound to be affected
 kisaan congress ke adhyaksh kedaar sirohi ne kaha ki uria hamaare genhu kaa bahut ahm uvarrak he
 Nitrogen is the most commonly found in urea
 genhu ke liye vegetitav growth karnaa hota he, dane kaa bananaa he, isliye uria bahut mahatvapurn he
 Agriculture Minister Sachin Yadav has brought the news of fertilizer shortage to the Minister of Fertilizers in Delhi
 kah rahe hai bharosa mil gaya he ki khaad mil jaaegi
 After the meeting, he said that the fertilizer minister has assured to fulfill the allocation of 13 lakh metric tons in the month of December
 iske alaava jo badha rakabaa he usamen madhyapradesh kii maang ko puraa karne kaa bharosa bhi unhone diya he
 Although the government says that some racks are still in transport, reaching the districts will improve the situation
 ek rack main 26 hajaar metric ton uria aata he
 To improve the situation, the government has also promised to give 80 percent of urea through cooperative societies and 20 percent fertilizer vendors

 Both symbolism and the use of double-meaning dialogues are also visible
 vaise bhi purv porn star sani leyoni 2016 ke edlt kamedi filmon kaa year rahane kii baat ghoshnaa kar chuki hai, kyonki 'kya kool hai ham-3' or 'mastijade' ke alaava 'great grand masti' bhi isi saal relies honi he
 By the way, the history of adult comedy has been good in Bollywood
 iskaa ishaara 'viki donor', 'shaukeen', 'hunter', 'dely baili', 'grand masti' jaisi filmon se mil jaataa he
 Let's take a look at the five reasons why adult comedy films are being made and are also becoming a hit - low budget, big earning, often in adult comedy films, the starcast is not big and because of this the budget is not very high
 lekin bhagdaud kii jidangi main har koi kuch raahat ke pal dhundta he
 In such a situation, it works in adult comedy films
 2012 main 12 karod rupee main bani 'kya super kool hai ham' ne box offis par 42 karod rupee kamaaye the, jabaki 'grand masti' 35 karod ke bajet kii thi or isane 135 karod rupee kamaaye the
 In this way , they are emerging as reliable bets in low budgets
 duubate ko tinke kaa saharathushar kapur, neha dhoopiya, aftab shivadaasaani, vir das auravivek oberoito neha sharma, kaaynaat aroda, karishma tanna
 These are names that are seen struggling in Bollywood
 hameshaa on-of rahete hai
 Often such actors are seen in adult films, due to which the budget of the film is low and they have complete freedom to make the director bold enough, while the mainstream actors of Bollywood do not like to take such risk

 In this way they become trendsetters

 In such an adult comedy and erotic thriller films are his special choice, which can be seen from the hit 'delhi Bailey' to the Grade Grand Masti business of Rs 100 crores

 Then when the joke is related to their life and things around them, they take it in their hands
 videshi baalaon kaa bindasapanmandana karimi (kya kool hai ham-3) or sani leyoni (mastijade) kaa muqabla 22 janvari or 29 janvari ko box offis par hoga
 The two also have many similarities, Sunny Leone has come in Bigg Boss and Mandana is getting close
 sani purv porn star hai to mandana ke letest photoshute ne unke iraade jaahir kar die hai, jabaki 'great grand masti' main bruna abdulla (brazilian model) or mariyam jakaaria (swedish-irani mul kii) apane jalwe dikhaa chuki hai

 Input: IANS 11 saal biit gaye
 In these eleven years, witnesses, evidence, hearings have changed many times
 kabhi salmaan ko raahat milti nazar ai to kabhi musbit or badhati dikhi
 During this time, Salman and Mumbai Police were also accused that they are trying to weaken both the case and the witness
 or inhen sabake bich buudhvaar ko mumbai seshan court ne salmaan kii maujuudagi main faisle se pehle wo faisla sunaaya ki salmaan kii wo raat ek baar phir jaag uthi
 Today 'dambag' Salman Khan is going through the golden phase of his career
 mitti ko bhi chhu kar sona bana dene vaale wo salmaan khan jisane sau karod se zyada kii kamai karne vaali filmon kii jhadi si laga di he
 But the fate of this Alexander of Muqaddar was never the same
 shoharat or musiibat donon salmaan ke saath judawaan kii tarah chipke rahe
 And there is one such problem that has been chasing Salman for the last 11 years
 jo unhen baar-baar filmi set ke baahar asli adaalat main is tarah hajir hone ko majaboor karata he
 After all, who is that ghost who is not ready to give up their chase for the last 11 years? 13 years ago, 22 September 2002, a five-star hotel of Juhu, Salman's stature was still bigger than that 70 mm screen whose big screen They were big stars
 par bada sitara hone ke saath-saath bollywood ke bade bigadel kaa bhi khitaab tab tak wo hasil kar chuke the
 The superhit success of 'hum Dil De Chuke Sanam' and the love and hatred between Aishwarya Rai's heartache kept coming out of this heartbreak, during the night of September 22, Salman became the soul of the party at Juhu's Five Star Hotel Were
 der raat tak party unka shagal tha
 Salman leaves the party after three in the night
 nashe main puri tarah chur
 He had a white Toyota Land Cruiser car that night to go home
 gaadi chalaane ke liye saath main bodyguard kam driver bhi
 But even after getting drunk, Salman himself sat on the driving seat
 bodygrd manaa karata rahaa
 But perhaps even when Salman once committed, he did not even listen to himself
 tadake 3 baj kar 40 minute, american express bekri, hill road, bandrashe main chur salmaan kii gaadi raat ke andhere main thik teen baj kar chalis minute par bandra ke hill road par pahunchati he
 The speed of the car was extremely fast and the driver got drunk
 hill road par american express bekri se kuch pehle hi achaanak driver gaadi kaa santulan kho baithta he or pal bhar main gaadi bain taraf se sadak chhod kar footpath par daudane lagati he
 Five employees working at the American Express Bakery were sleeping on the same sidewalk at that time from Badnasibi
 tej raftaar land kruger paanchon ko raudate hue aage nikalati he or phir dukaan ke shater se takaraa kar gaadi ruk jaati he
 In the accident, a worker dies almost on the spot
 jabaki chaar majdoor buree tarah se jakhmi ho jate hai
 The legs of most of the four were trampled by the car
 haadase ke baad salmaan khan achaanak ghabara jate hai
 They get down from the driving seat
 tab tak gaadi ke footpath se takaraane or ghayalon kii cheekh-pukaar sun kar aasapaas so rahe baaki log bhi jaag jaat hai or maukey par pahunchate hai
 People pull out the people trapped under the car and are taken to the hospital
 salmaan gaadi maukey par hi chhod kar tab tak gaayab ho cho chuke the
 But even with a 70 mm screen, one glimpse of his height is enough to identify him
 bhaagane se pehle salmaan ko sab pahchaan chuke the
 By morning, the news had spread all over Mumbai
 salmaan khan ke daaman par ek or daag lag chukaa tha
 But Salman himself was missing since the accident
 lekin gaadi kaa number or chashmadid salmaan ke khilaaf chugali kha chuke the
 So in the morning the police reach Salman's house
 par salmaan ghar par nahin the
 Actually Salman Khan wanted some time for the legal game
 isiilie wo gaayab the
 But he knew that running too late could increase the odds
 jamaanat milane main dikkat aegi
 So about eight hours after the accident, he himself comes in front and the police arrest him
 iske baad unhen jeje aspatal le jaaya jaataa he
 Where after investigation it is proved that he had taken alcohol
 salmaan ke khilaaf police laaparvaahee or khatarnaak dhang se gaadi chalaane kaa maamla to darj kar leti he
 But shortly after his arrest, he is released on bail with a fine of only Rs 950
 salmaan kii itani aasaani rihaai kaa kuch saamaajik sanghathan viredh karte hai or paanch aktubar 2002 ko adaalat pahunchate jate hai
 They file a public interest litigation against Salman in the court and demand that Salman be booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder
 adaalat naa sirf yachika manjuur kar leti he balki saat aktubar 2002 ko adalati aadesh par gaiyr iradan hatya ke jurm main salmaan ko giraftaar kar liya jaataa he
 Salman goes to jail
 wo puure 18 dinon tak jail main rahete hai
 During this time, they apply for bail four times
 magar chaaron baar jamaanat kii arji khaarij ho jaati he
 Then 18 days later, on 24 October 2002, Salman gets bail and is released
 salmaan kii rihaai ke baad maamla court main chalata rahata he
 During this time there are several turns in the case
 sabase pehle salmaan kii taraf se kaha jaataa he ki us raat wo gaadi chalaa hi nahin rahe the, balki gaadi koi or chalaa rahaa tha
 Then, four years after the accident, one day, one of the key witnesses in the case, Abdullah Rauf Sheikh, also turns back from his testimony
 abdulla maamla kaa chashmadid tha or haadase main ghayal hua tha
 Initially, he told the police that he saw Salman coming down from the driving seat of the car after the accident
 magar chaar saal baad 2006 main wo adaalat ko bataata he ki usne salmaan ko maukey par dekha hi nahin tha
 But before this testimony could have relieved Salman, Salman's former bodyguard Ravindra Patil himself slammed Salman
 rabindra patil haadase vaali raat salmaan ke saath usee gaadi main maujuud tha
 He told the court that Salman was drunk that night and was driving the same car even after he refused
 jabaki haadase ke shikaar baaki kuch gavaah bhi gavaahi par kaayam the
 It took 11 years for the case to get entangled in different witnesses and statements
 or ab aakhirkaar adaalat ne laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane kii bajaae gaiyr iradatan hatya ke tahat salmaan ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kaa faisla suna diya he
 Salman was booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 (2) of IPC
 vahiin dhara 279 ke tahat nashe main driving or laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane kaa aarope tay hua
 While accused of causing serious injury under Sections 337 and 338
 iske alaava dhara 427 ke tahat bhi aarope lagaae gaye
 That means the road ahead has become difficult
 gunaah sabit hone par salmaan das saal tak ke liye jail ja sakate hai
 However, Salman Khan got so much relief that now he will not have to go round the court on every hearing
 lekin adaalat ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki aage jab bhi jarurat hogi, salmaan ko bagaiyr kisi hill-hawaale ke adaalat main aana hoga
 The court has fixed August 19 as the next date of hearing in the case

) While flagging off 'run for Unity', PM Modi said that the pairing of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel was unmatched
 patel kii 139veen jayanti ke maukey par vijay chowk par yojit samaaroh main modi ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi or sardaar vallabhbhai patel ke bich atoot rishta tha
 Gandhiji entrusted the task of Dandi Yatra to Sardar Patel
 aisa lagata tha ki sardaar sahab ke bina gandhi ji bhi adhure the
 Yadmodi said to Indira that a nation that does not respect its history cannot create it
 unhone 1984 main aaj hi ke din tatkaaleen pradhanmantriindira gandhiki hatya ke baad hue sikh virdohi dangon kaa apratyaksh taur par zikr bhi kiya
 Modi said that Sardar Patel devoted his entire life to the unity of the country and it is unfortunate that 'our own people' were killed on his birth anniversary 30 years ago
 unki tippanee indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue dangon ko lekar thi
 Referring to the contribution of Sardar Patel popularly known as 'iron Man', the PM clarified that this initiative is not an attempt to undermine the contribution of any other leader
 modi ne kaha, 'hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki jo raashtra apane itihaas kaa sammaan nahin karata he, vah iskaa srijan kabhi nahin kar saktaa
 Do not divide history, heritage into ideology
 'modi ne kaha, 'apane raajnneetik jivan main baadha aane ke baavjood patel rashtriya ekta kii apni soch se kabhi vichlit nahin hue
 It is unfortunate for the country that 30 years ago such an event occurred on the birth anniversary of such a leader, which shook the unity of the nation
 ' modi ne kaha, 'hamaare apane logon maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya
 This incident is not only a wound on the hearts of people of a particular religion, but a dagger in the heart of India's heritage and culture of thousands of years
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aaj purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii punyatithi he
 Recalling Sardar Patel's contribution to the 'unfinished Gandhi without Patel' freedom movement, Modi said that Mahatma Gandhi had entrusted him with the responsibility of planning the historic Dandi March which he successfully completed
 piem ne kaha, 'jab ham ramakrishna paramhans ko dekhte hai tab aisa lagata he ki vah swami vivekanand ke bina purna nahin hai
 In the same way when we see Mahatma Gandhi, he still seems incomplete without Sardar Patel
 'modi ne kaha ki aaj patel kii jayanti kaa prerak parv he
 Sardar Patel dusted the British dream
 patel kaa jivan desh kii ekta ko samarpit he
 On this occasion, Modi administered the oath of unity to the people across the country
 modi ne patel kii pratimaa par pushp arpit kar unhen shradhanjali di
 On this occasion, all BJP leaders including Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad were present

 In the fourth session of GST Conclave, Delhi Government Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia presented his stand on the preparation and challenges of GST
 is satr kaa sanchaalan shweta singh ne kiya
 Shweta asked Manish Sisodia why the Aam Aadmi Party has been opposing the government after joining the GST Council with the government
 manish sisodiya ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa ye idia kaaphi acha he, lekin ise lagu karne kaa tarika sahi nahin he
 Sisodia said that he had mentioned zero percent tax in the council
 vahiin sarkaar ne kai tarah ke tex lagaae hai jinpar sawaal uth rahaa he
 According to Sisodia, who will be able to pay 28% tax on tea biscuits
 unhone kaha ki ye pehali baar he ki kapadon par bhi tex lagegaa
 YGST is just the income generating tax of the government
 manish ne kaha ki jiesti ke lagu hone se kaaphi mahangaai bad jaaegi
 He said that the central government accepted many of our ideas, they gave good debate in this many ways
 lekin bada faisla nahin le paae, jiesti se kaaphi kuch bighad saktaa he
 Manish Sisodia said that 28% tax is too much for the common man of the country
 unhone kaha ki sharaab or real state ko isse baahar rakhana galat faisla, in donon ko jiesti ke daayre main laana chahie tha
 You are imposing GST on things like cement, but it is wrong not to impose real state
 sisodiya bole ki hamanetex systamame dilli main kaaphi acha badlaav kiya he, agar centre sarkaar logon ko vishwaas main leti to kaaphi acha hota
 Manish Sisodia said that i still have more questions about this, and their answers are less
 unhone kaha ki iske lagu hone se centre or rajya sarkaar ko zyada phayda hoga, aam aadmi ko nahin
 He said that bringing GST is not a crime, but it is necessary to benefit the public but it is not visible
 abhi bhi logon main isko lekar dar he
 Sisodia said that celebrating it is not right, it should have been implemented without celebration
 unhone kaha ki jisko tex kii samaj he wo samajhegaa ki ab vah waite se hatakar GST ke shikanje main aa gaya he
 He said that there should be such a system that people give tax happily, there should not be such an atmosphere that people start stealing
 hamaari sarkaar ne tex ko ghataya to tex kaa revenyu bad gaya he
 This is not freedom, were we in financial freedom earlier
 agar ye aazaadee he, to ham aazaadee kaa matlab hi nahin jaanate hai

 GST kaa phayda tab hoga jab log khushi-khushi tex dena shuru karaden

 In 2013, BJP won just 11 seats out of 29 reserved for tribals

 Former minister and MLA Satyanarayana Sharma says, "congress still enjoys the trust of tribals in Chhattisgarh
" bhaajapa unhen gumraah nahin kar paaegi
 "the irony is that in the state which has 32 percent tribal population, there are very few tribal leaders in both Congress and BJP
" bhaajapa ke liye ek ahm chunavi mudda dhan kaa bonus baantnaa hoga, jise 2014 main centre main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad band kar diya gaya tha

 In the 2013 elections, BJP won 9 out of 10 seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC) of the state
 ye vahi siten thim jahaan satnami vot nateezon par asar daal sakate hai
 So if Satnami votes go to Jogi's court, they can definitely harm the BJP, because last time the votes of this community were found wholesale
 yahi nahin, rajya main 7
 Nearly 10 per cent are votes of the upper castes ie Brahmins, Thakurs and Vaishyas, a part of which can be returned to the Congress, which left it when Jogi, as Chief Minister, put all his strength behind the tribal and scheduled castes

 The Sanskrit text introduces the knowledgeable Bahuguna Suryakant to Ramajor Pandey, who has come to India from Suriname in search of his ancestors
 ranjor pandey kaa koi vaaris nahin he or sooryakanth kaa patrkaar mitra bahuguna chahta he ki sooryakanth apni sooyeeboojh se pandey ko prabhavit kar unka uttaradhikari ban jaae

 apane us parivaar ke bich jahaan uski patni gauri kaa apmaan hua tha
 His father repents his actions, but in all of this developments, Suryakant is forever estranged from his family
 phir jab ant main vah lakhanu pahunchataa he to vahaan ranjor pandey or sampoornanand brihaspati ko ek saath paata he
 Ramajor Pandey is sponsoring that project of Sampurnanand under PPP, due to which Suryakant is intent on quitting his job in anger
 kai kahaniyaan milakar bani hai nirvaasannirvaasan kaa shabdic arth he nishkasana yaa balpurvak kisi ko kisi rajya yaa bhu-bhaag se nikaal dena
 The novel has several stories of exile that run concurrently
 pehali kahani he iske mukhya kirdaar sooryakanth kii jo apane pita kii ore se apane parivaar se nishkasit he kyonki vah gauri se prem karata he or usase shaadi karnaa chahta he
 It was a cold winter night in Sultanpur when Suryakant brought Gauri to meet his family
 koharaa itnaa ghanaa tha ki khud ke kapade bamushkil dikh rahe the
 Babuji had locked the door more vigorously by holding Suryakant's neck at 11 o'clock in the night and pushing him and Gauri out
 daravaaje par chillaate hue babuji gauri ko bhaddi bhaddi gaaliyaan de rahe the
 The second story is that of billionaire Ramajor Pandey and his grandfather Bhagelu Kumhar alias Bhagelu Pandey who moved to Suriname about 125 years ago in India due to famine, drought, poverty, starvation and helplessness to return to his family all his life They are longing for ab unka arbapati pota apane purvajon kii talash main india aayaa hua he or jisaki vajah se yah puri kahani likhi gai he
 The third story is of Suryakant's uncle who was very intelligent in studies

 All the things of Aishoram were in his house
 jindagi bade maje main cat rahi thi
 But in the wife, while searching for her Balwant Kaur (girlfriend), the uncle gets a loud shock and starts living a life of simplicity by creating a room separate from his luxurious house and family
 sooryakanth ke jivan main jis ek vyakti kaa prabhaav sabase zyada he wo hai uske chachaa, jinka naam is upanyaas main kahin bhi ujagar nahin kiya gaya he

 chachaa sultanpur main rahete hai or professor hai lekin unhone apni naukari chhod di he kyonki unke parivaar ko unki nahin balki unki kamai se pyaar he
 There are arguments between uncle and nephew on many topics
 chachaa ke aadhuniktaa virdohi tarkon par bhattije kaa sakaaratmak uttar pathneey he
 Both the interesting Anchachacha nephews had such a hunger to read that during their school days they would leave early for school and sit at the shop of comrade Komal outside the school gate and read the newspaper
 itnaa hi nahin chachaa to interval ke dauraan bhi yaheen aakar akhbaar padhate the kyonki kamred komal kii dukaan par hindi ke saare akhbaar aate the
 Comrade Komal's shop was dominated by communists and socialists, and this influence was evident in the period of Chacha's life
 chachaa ke padhane kaa alam yah tha ki unhone course kii kitaaben pehali timahi main hi padhakar khatm kar di thim
 He was the first student in 8 years to demand books from the school library
 aalmariyon main rakhi kitaaben jab chaabiyon se nahin khuleen to librarian ne hathaudaa markar uske shishe tode or unhen upanyaas diya
 The uncle asked the librarian how would it be safe now? The librarian responded with a laugh - someone will steal them too? Where did the librarian know that in the addiction of education, uncle would steal many books from there and make his home beautiful
 padhane kii aadat ke kaaran bhattije sooryakanth ke paas bahut teji se padhane kaa hunar he
 When Gauri wakes up many nights and gives the written love letter to Suryakant, he reads it shortly and it makes Gauri angry as she realizes Suryakant has made fun of her love letter
 naubat yahaan tak aati he ki wo sooryakanth se baat karnaa band kar detii he
 The story also mentions the fear of sterilization during the Emergency
 skool, college ke chaatro par nasbandi kii itani hadashat tha ki har samay unka ek haath apane guptang par rahane laga tha
 Suryakant's journey from Lucknow to Sultanpur and from there to Gosainganj brings many more characters including Jagadamba, Nupur, Kamna, Shibbu to the story which make this story fun
 jab aap ye kahani padhenge to janenge kishkyon paryaton nideshaalay main ucch pad par asin sooryakanth ko job se lambii chuttee par janaa padataa he?immergency ke dauraan nasbandi kaa khauf kaa alam or is dauraan mundan ko gaye kai bacchon ke sir kyon aadhe chhile rah gaye?aishoaaraam se bharpoor parivaar kaa mukhiya, jo yahaan chachaa hai, apane parivaar ko chhod alag kyon rahane lagata he?kya sooryakanth arbapati ranjor pandey kaa uttaradhikari ban sakaa?in sawaalon ke alaava bhi kai or chijen hai is kahani main

 Playing with fire is not free from danger and not at all in the pub
 liquid nitrogen se lekar fire shots tak ham sab pine lage hai
 But playing with gases can be fatal
 dilli nivasee ek vyakti ne josh-josh main liquid nitrogen pi liya, jiske baad use gurugram ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 The person got pierced in the stomach after drinking nitrogen
 ghatana do maheene pehle kii he or ab peedit vyakti ke swasthya main kaaphi sudhaar he
 Yes, there was a hole in the stomach! The more frightening the reading sounds, the more doctors told it
 doctoron ke mutabik nitrogen pine vaale vyakti kaa pet khuli kitaab kii tarah ho gaya tha
 a 30-year-old man also drank liquid nitrogen along with a drink, according to a Hindustan Times report
 pine ke baad use biimaar hone jaisaa laga, iske baavjood usne ek or drink liya
 After some time, a person drinking liquid nitrogen complained of discomfort, difficulty in breathing and stomach swelling
 iske baad use turant aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan doctoron ne uskaa ilaaj shuru kiya
 Doctors found a hole in her stomach
 report ke mutabik vyakti ne naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha, 'pehla shot lene ke baad mujhe asahaj lagane laga, jaise pet main acid nikal rahaa ho
 Meanwhile, the bartender pushed another drink and without taking care of myself, i drank another drink

 That is, one liter of liquid nitrodon gas can take an expansion of 694 liters at 20 ° c temperature
 agar kisi vyakti ke sharir main lactic acid kii maatra bahut zyada he, to uske saath bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 Doctors found that in this case too, the amount of lactic acid in the body of the person was high, due to which there was a reaction in his stomach
 iske chalate vyakti ke pet main oxigen kii kami ho jaati he or use ventilator par rakhana padataa he
 In this case, during surgery, doctors found that the person had a large hole in his stomach
 cese main sah-sarjan rahe doctor mrigank es sharma ne bataaya, 'aamtaur par ksharan se pet main chote-chote chhidr ho jate hai, jinhen sila ja saktaa he
 But in this case we found that the middle and bottom part of the person's stomach was opened like a book

 Tissues near the damaged part of the abdomen were also damaged

 That is why he is sitting with a bad face

 As soon as the big needle reached 12, Apu's eyes widen

 Everything was the same as before, then what happened that became his son's evil

 The film ends at a point where only questions are found
 aap bhi dekhie ye short film
 
 
 May be, this is also the reason for your child's silence

 kamaal khan (kamaal r Khan) kaa ek or twit viral ho rahaa he
 KRK, who often targets politicians, has personally tweeted this time
 kamaal khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twit kar apni kamai or bacchon kaa zikr kiya he
 People's reactions to this tweet have also started coming
 kamaal khan aksar twit ke jariye apni raay rakhte hai or is baar bhi unhone aisa hi kuch kiya he
 Now i don't have any problem at all to die anytime
 Because i have left that much cash with my children that they don't need to do anything during next 30 years
 Hope they will be able to take care of themselves after 30 years
 kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne twit kiya: "ab main kabhi bhi maruun mujhe koi pareshaani nahin he, kyonki main apane bacchon ke liye itnaa paisa chhodkar jaaoongaa ki unhen 30 saalon tak kuch bhi karne kii zarurat nahin hogi
 Hopefully after 30 years he will be able to handle himself
 " kamaal khan kaa twit khub viral ho rahaa he
 Kamal Khan did not stop, he also tweeted another after this tweet
 And i hope that my children will also take care of their children like me only
 Even though my children think that i have spoiled them and they won't be able to do that much for their childrenhttps: / / t
 co / jeiogxuhzfkamala aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne aage likhaa: "main aashaa karata hum ki mere bachche bhi apane bacchon kaa khyaal meri hi tarah rakhenge
 However, my children think that i spoiled them

 Kamal r Khan has also appeared in Bigg Boss
 ham philhal do chizon ke bare main jaanate hai
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, who is related to the Congress leader and the royal family, has removed all the information related to his party from his Twitter handle
 ab unke twitor handle par likhaa he ki wo keval ek lok sevak or cricket samarthak hai
 Earlier, Scindia's Twitter handle had written that he is a former MP from Guna
 iske alaava unke mantri pad se judi jaankaree bhi unke twitor handle par thi
 On this, Scindia says that he has shortened his introduction on the Twitter handle so that it looks simple and should not be construed as any differences with the Congress
 unhone kaha, 'ise ek maheene pehle apane parichay ko chota or saral karne ke liye kiya gaya tha
 i pity those speculating on this issue
 ' unhone mujhase kaha, 'main congress party kaa kaaryakarta hum or mere andar mere pita madhavrao sindhiya kaa khun he
 i have never held a longing for any position in my 17-year career
 'kisi bhi niyukti se sambandhit spashtikaran nahin aane kii vajah se madhyapradesh main congress ke pramukh ke rup main padbhaar sanbhaalane ke bare main baat bad rahi he
 This state is one of the few states in which Congress is in power
 iske alaava baat un rajyon kii bhi he jahaan majboot netaaon kii tikdi ke bich ghuspaith karne se party ko khatra he
 Critics of Scindia say that the government is being run by Kamal Nath and former CM Digvijay Singh as CM and Scindia, who could not stake his claim against Kamal Nath on the candidature for CM, is considering leaving the party
 yah bhartiya rajanetaaon kii udaasi, gusse or apane man kii baat ko soshal media or mukhya rup se twitor ke jariye kehane ke prati sachet karata he
 Examples are Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar and Supriya Sule
 isliye sindhiya 30 se kam karactors main yaa usase kam main congress ko telegraph bhej rahe hai yah atakalein uchit hai
 This month, the Congress managed to reach a simple majority of 115 in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly by winning the Jhabua seat in the by-election
 bhaajapa ke paas 107 sadsy hai
 So whatever the grip of the Congress is but it is safe and any rebellion by Scindia and his supporters will be the cause of the disaster
 haalanki, madhya pradesh ke kai varisht netaa jinhone is stambh ke liye baat kii, unhone sindhiya ke samarthakon dwaara kamalnath sarkaar ko kisi tarah ke khatre kii baat ko khaarij kar diya
 At least 10 of Scindia's mlas are quite confident of him
 party ke ek netaa ne majaak main kaha, "15 ko bhul jaao, maharaj (sindhiya kii shahi viraasat par chutki lete hue) ke paas do vidhayak bhi nahin honge
 a person who has lost his base only wants to find a reason to blame the BJP
 mat bhoolen ki unke parivaar main se zyaadaatar bijepi main hai
 We know that he is in touch with Amit Shah, who was facilitated by the late Arun Jaitley
 "congress main vartmaan main adhikansh chizon ke saath sthiti behad jatil he
 i had previously described Scindia in one column here as one of the lost boys, a follower of Peter Pan, the boy who refused to grow up
 rahul gandhi, purv-congress adhyaksh peter pan hai, or khoe hue ladke aise netaa hai jinke swayan ke kariyar arji ke aadhe-adhure netritv ke parinamswaroop ruk gaye hai
 Scindia is a close friend of Gandhi, yet he was angry at Kamal Nath being made the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in December last year
 vah kai baar apni naaraazgi ke saath saarvajanik ho chuke hai, jisamen kashmir main dhara 370 ko hataane ke maamle par rahul gandhi ke saath saarvajanik rup se matbhed hai, lekin party ne unhen bade paimaane par andekha kiya
 Though he has not fully ignited his ties with the Congress, Scindia had clearly stated in the past that he wanted to become the local Congress chief, a post still held by Kamal Nath, as well as a Rajya Sabha seat
 So that they can make their way to Parliament
 kamalnath, jo empi ke power sameekaran main apane purna grahan par sindhiya ke liye raji hai, ne pehle congress adhyaksh, sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii, jo empi ke congress pramukh ke pad ke liye thi
 But senior Congress leaders say, sometimes there is no decision in the Congress
 yah bhi ek nirnay he
 in confusion? Don't be congress ke bijantin darbar kii raajnneeti main, sindhiya kii purv digvijay singh ke saath kaaphi pratidwandvita he, jo abhi bhi party tantra par ek badi kaman rakhte hai or jinhone rajya pramukh ke liye sindhiya par vito lagaaya
 Gandhi is just trying to balance the triangular battle
 sindhiya ke samarthakon kaa kahana he ki unhen apane shivi kii suraksha ke liye rajya pramukh banaaya janaa chahie
 This is also a reaction as Singh has driven Scindia out of the stronghold of Gwalior
 singh kamalnath ke bahut bade samarthak hai or unhen bhopal main "super siem" kaha jaataa he
 Scindia's struggle reflects much of the power struggle of the Young Turks versus the old guardians of the Congress
 rajasthan main sachin payalat or ashok gahalot ke bich baar-baar jhadap ke saath ek aisi hi kahani saamne aa rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi, who has just returned from a "meditation" from abroad, is still upset
 puraane congressi paharedaar, yuva netaaon ko aage nahin badhane de rahe hai
 If the Congress eventually forms a government in alliance with Shiv Sena and Sharad Pawar in Maharashtra, the old stalwarts will continue their work
 iske baavjood soshal media par tamaam baaten ho rahi hai

 haalanki, ab kamalnath ne you-turn le liya he
 He said, 'vande Mataram will be sung in Bhopal in an attractive form with the participation of police band and common people
 har maheene ke pehle kaarydiwas par subah 10:45 baje police band raashtra bhaavana jaagrit karne vaale dhun bajaate hue shaury smarak se vallabh bhawan tak march karenge
 'shivraj's declaration - i will sing, then after Vande Mataram's anthem on the first day of bowed Kamal Nathsal, former state Chief Minister and BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chauhan grabbed the case hands-on and started a stinging attack on Congress 
 unhone poocha ki aakhir kiske kehane par vande maataram gane kii parampara kothoda gaya
 Shivraj said, 'if the Congress does not know the words of the national anthem or is ashamed of singing the national anthem, then tell me
 har maheene kii pehali taarikh ko vallabh bhawan ke praangan main janata ke saath vande maataram main gaaungaa
 'vande Mataramshivraj, who was being sung since 2005, raised the question that with whose consent and consent Vande Mataram's group anthem was not done on 1 January
 unhone elaan kiya ki bhaajapa ke sabhi vidhayak saat janvari ko samuhik vande maataram gaayenge
 It is to be known that in the year 2005, during the tenure of the then Chief Minister Babulal Gaur, collective singing of Vande Mataram was started on the first day of every month
 yah silsilaa beete 13 saalon se anwarat chalaa aa rahaa tha, magar satta badalane ke baad kii pehali taarikh arthath 1 janvari ko hi vallabh bhawan parisar main vande maataram nahin hua
 This led to the government getting embroiled in controversies
 congress tukade-tukade gang kii samarthaksamuhik vande maataram gaan kaa aayojan saamaanya prashasan vibhaag dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Presently this department is with Chief Minister Kamal Nath, hence BJP directly intensified the attack on Kamal Nath
 bhaajapa ne kaha, 'mukhyamantri kamalnath ne ek janvari se vande maataram gayan bandakarke pradesh ke rashtrabhakt nagarikon ko nae saal kaa tohfa diya he
 But by doing this, the Congress Party and Kamal Nath have set the agenda for the coming Lok Sabha elections
 kamalnath sarkaar ke is kadam se saaf ho gaya he ki vot bank kii raajnneeti ke chalate congress or kamalnath bharat ke tukade-tukdekarne ke naare lagane vaale gang ko raajnneetik sangrakshan pradaan karenge
 'kamal Nath had to be clarified after catching up with this matter
 unhone kaha, 'hamaari bhi dharm, rashtriyata, deshbhakti main aasthaa he
 The Congress Party, which fought for the independence of the country, does not require a certificate from anyone for patriotism, nationality
 bhaajapaaise par raajnneeti na kare, ise (vande maataram gayan) nae rup main lagu karenge
 'BJP sang collective Vande Mataram: In protest against the unannounced ban on the 13-year-old tradition of singing Vande Mataram collectively in the ministry premises in Madhya Pradesh, BJP on Wednesday organized a rendition of the collective Vande Mataram in the garden in front of the ministry
 bhaajapa ne, har maah kii 1 taarikh kohone vaale samuhik vande maataram gayan par roak kaa virodh karte hue mantralay ke kareeb sthit udyaan main vande maataram kaa samavet gayan kiya
 Also, former Chief Minister Chauhan wrote in a tweet, 'I and all BJP mlas will sing Vande Mataram on the first day of the assembly session on January 7 at 10 am in the courtyard of Vallabh Bhavan
 is muhim se judane hetu aap sabhi kaa swaagat he
 Chauhan further said, "congress may have forgotten that governments come and go, but there is nothing above country and patriotism
 main maang karata hum ki vande maataram kaa gaan hameshaa kii tarah har cabinet metig se pehle or har maheene kii pehali tarikh ko hameshaa kii tarah vallabh bhawan ke pranganmen ho
 However, seeing himself surrounded by all around, Kamal Nath took a U-turn on the matter and announced that from now on, Vande Mataram would be sung with the police band

 Archaeologists at Deccan College Deemed University, Pune, found the skeleton of a young couple during the excavation
 maut ke vakt donon kii umr lagbhag 21 se 35 saal ke bich rahi hogi
 During the excavation, the two met in the same grave and the male skeleton had a female face
 yah kankal haryana ke rakhigadhi main harappakalin sabhyataa kaa 4,500 saal purana bataaya ja rahaa he
 This skeleton was found in 2016 but it was being researched
 research main yah pataa lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki is yugal ko ek saath dafnane ke myne kya hai
 After two years of research, archaeologists have now reached a position to say something
 puratatvavidon ke anusaar, jis tarah se yugal ke kankal dafan mili hai usase saaf he ki donon ke bich prem tha
 This is just a possibility
 jin logon ne donon ko dafnaaya hoga, ve chaahate the ki donon ke bich marane ke baad bhi pyaar bana rahe
 Such a case of burial of a couple is not rare in ancient civilizations, he said
 yugal kii kabr main mitti ke bartanon or ek jhaalarwaali akik kii guriyaan bhi mili hai, jo shaayad mahila kii jewelery kaa hissaa rahi hongi
 The first case of burial in this way is the first time a couple's grave has been found during the excavation of the Harappan civilization
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki ab tak hadappa sabhyataa se sambandhit kai kabristaanon kii khudaai kii ja chuki he, lekin aaj tak kisi bhi yugal ke is tarah dafnane kaa maamla saamne nahin aayaa tha
 Rakhigarhi of Haryana is located 150 km northwest of Delhi
 puratatvavidon ne bataaya khudaai ke dauraan mili saakshyon se pataa chalata he ki jode ko ek hi samay main dafnaaya gaya he kyonki aisa koi sakshya nahin mila he ki pehle kisi ek ko, phir duusare ko dafnaaya gaya ho
 The skeletons of the couple being buried together during their youth are increasing the interest of archaeologists
 pune maanad vishvavidhyalay ne is khoj kii puri jaankaree antarrashtriya jarnal asibi jarnal of anatomi and cell biology main prakashit kiya he
 This report also notes that the skeleton's mouth, hands and feet are all of the same time

 Archaeologists have excavated about 62 tombs at Rakhigarhi
 khudaai or vishleshan uniwarsity ke puraatatv vibhaag or institute of farensik science, sol neshnal uniwarsity college of medicine dwaara kiya gaya

 Sharad Pawar continued to interact with Sonia Gandhi and Uddhav Thackeray
 teenon partiyon ne netaaon ne sarkaar kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya, kis party ke kitne mantri honge, yah tay ho gaya
 But all equations remained intact and BJP formed government with NCP leader Ajit Pawar
 lekin is puure ghatnakram ke bich kai sawaal uthte hai ki yah puraa khel aakhir hua kaise
 Did Sharad Pawar agree to alliance with BJP? kya bijepi or ensipi kii baatcheet pehle se chal rahi thi yaa ajit pavaar baagi ho gaye hai? is par news agency eenai ne sutron ke hawaale se kaha ki sharad pavaar devendra fadanvis kii aguai vaali gathbandhan sarkaar kii baatcheet kaa hissaa the
 It was he who approved Ajit Pawar to move forward
 sutron ne yah bhi kaha ki ajit pavaar ensipi ke sansadeey dal ke netaa hai or party main koi faisla sharad pavaar kii manjuuri ke bina nahin liya ja saktaa

 The support of 145 mlas is needed to form a government in the state
 agar bijepi-ensipi yah number nahin juta paati to floor test main sarkaar paas nahin ho paaegi
 However, this picture will be cleared in a few days
 lekin ensipi or bijepi kaa sarkaar bana lenaa yakeenan shivasena or congress donon ke liye kisi jatke se kam nahin he
 It remains to be seen how the politics of the state sits next
