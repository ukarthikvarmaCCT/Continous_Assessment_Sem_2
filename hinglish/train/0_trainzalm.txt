 Second is that there is a high Saturn in Libra and Libra sign is related to business, partnership, justice and enjoyment, hence the Guru's auspicious eyes will be there
 lekin guru kii shubhta main chaar chand isliye bhi lag rahe hai ki jab guru ne mithun main pravesh kiya to us samay vahaan pehle se hi shubh grah shukr or svagrahi budh kii grah sthiti thi

 Although the central bank has now started giving importance to economic growth, it is also concerned about the inflation scenario
 haal ke maheenon main kachche tel or khaane-pine kii vastuon ke daamon main badhotaree ke kaaran mahangaai kii sthiti ko ‘chunauteepurn’ bataaya he
 The Reserve Bank has targeted annual inflation of 6 in 2012-13
 5 pratishat rakhaa he, jo 2011-12 ke anumaan se aadha fisad kam he
 During the last 36 months, the Reserve Bank had tightened monetary policy stance due to inflation
 baad ke maheenon main usne daron ko sthir kar diya tha
 During this period, the Reserve Bank has made a total of 13 consecutive times of repo rates during a period of 19 months
 75 pratishat kii badhotaree kii
 This earned him the image of the world's most aggressive central bank
 unchi byaaj daron kii vajah se na keval nivesh prabhavit hota he, balki isse khudara rin lene vaale log bhi karj lene se bachate hai, kyonki awaas rin kaa bhugtan karnaa kisi bhi parivaar ke liye ek bada sankat ban jaataa he
 Regarding non-food credit, the central bank estimates that its growth rate will be 17 per cent in the current financial year, which will be slightly higher than the previous financial year
 vahiin jamaa kii vruddhi dar 16 fisad rahegi
 In addition, the Reserve Bank has set up a working group led by KU Rao to look into all aspects related to gold loans (loans on gold) of non-banking financial institutions (nbfcs)
 rigerv bank ne kaha, ‘haal ke samay main enbiensi ke gold lone main ullekhneey ijapha dekhne ko mila he
 Apart from this, there have been complaints against some nbfcs that they are not following the guidelines related to preparing documents and Know Your Customer (KYC)
 ’kendriya bank ne kaha ki sone kaa aayaat kaaphi teji se badha he, jisase vrihad aarthik chintaa badi he
 The workgroup is expected to submit its report by the end of July 2012
 rigerv bank 18 june ko maudrik niti kii madhya timahi samiksha pesh karegaa or uske baad 31 july ko timahi samiksha pesh karegaa
 Now, if the repair of the national highway starts after seeing prime time, then you do not have to tell where you should send the report of the road in your area
 hamen kai jagahon se sadak nirmaan sangharsh samiti ke email mili hai
 People are struggling by forming a committee to repair new roads and broken roads in their respective areas
 unhen laga ki agar saharsa-madhepura neshnal haive 107 kii tarah unke ilaake kii sadak kaa haal dikhaaya jaae to sarkaar or adhikari tivi kaa dibet chhodkar kuch kaam bhi karne lag jaaenge
 On the night of 11 July, a gentleman started telling that the condition of NH-43 between Chhattisgarh Te Ambikapur to Jashpur is also very bad
 yahaan bhi 3 saal se company kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Right now we were thinking of collecting all the facts and photos about this highway that in the evening news came that the pits of Saharsa Purnia National Highway 107 are being filled
 aapako yaad hoga ki buudhvaar ke prime time main hamane saharsa se purniya ke bich neshnal hive 107 kii ye haalat dikhaai thi
 For three years, the people there were waiting for the construction of this road, but the pits were expanding and ordinary citizens were facing a lot of problems
 hamaare sahyogi kanhaiya ne is sadak par 20 kilometre bike chalaakar ricarding kii taaki darshakon ko andaaza ho sake ki is haive kii kis kadar upeksha kii gai he
 Even in October last year, the Prime Minister had announced its double lane, but even after eight months of his announcement, pits continued to be built and were being made
 prime time main dikhaae jane ke 24 ghante ke bheetar asar ho gaya he
 Kanhaiya said that after showing the news of July 11, the pits started filling up from the evening of July 12
 teri ye bindiya dil le gai vaala gaanaa jesibi mashin ke bheetar baj rahaa he
 After all, the work of filling the pit should not be so monotonous
 kanhaiya ne bataaya ki neshnal haive athurity of india ke nirdesh par gaiman india ne is sadak ko motarable yani sugamya banane ke liye jesibi mashin utaar di he
 The pits are being filled and leveled
 inhen bharne ke liye sadak nirmaan saamagree giraayi jane lagi he
 Kutha nalas will also be made to prevent the accumulation of water on the roadside
 yah kaam abhi madhepura ke muraliganj se shuru hua he
 It seems that the transport ministers are also watching prime time or if they do not see it, so the contractors must have saved their lives by filling the pit at least
 jo bhi he aap sabhi darshakon ko badhai
 It is like a mountain to remain an audience of such essential news

 You choose the MLA or MP so that they can raise questions related to your problem in the House and force the government to answer
 har prashn kaa jawaab system ke bheetar javabdehi kii nai harakat paidaa karata he, ye wo jawaab hota he jo zyaada vishwasaneey mana jaataa he
 We kept on assuming that the legislators get answers to whatever questions are asked, but a report in Rajasthan Patrika showed that not all the questions get answers
 yahi nahin vidhayakon ke puche gaye prashnon ke jawaab pichhali chaar chaar vidhansabhaon se latake pade hai or ab in prashnon ko samaapt ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 This news of Sunil Singh Sisodia of Rajasthan Patrika is a lesson for the current and former mlas
 is khabar ke mutabik 3000 prashnon ko samaapt ghoshit kar diya gaya he jo dasvin vidhansabha se lekar 13veen vidhansabha ke dauraan puche gaye magar lambit rahe yani jinka jawaab nahin mila
 a number of questions have been written quoting sources, but in this news, the statement of Rao Raje Singh, Speaker of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly has also been published that the pending questions are no longer justified
 jinka jawaab ab koi nahin chahta he
 Now they are also not relevant because the fourteenth assembly is still in existence
 kya yah hairaani kii baat nahin he ki jin vibhaagon yaa mantralayon se sambandhit prashn puche gaye unhone vidhansabha ko jawaab dena hi uchit nahin samajha
 According to the rules, when mlas ask questions, they have to reply within 21 days, but here the need was not felt for many years
 is dauran congress or bijepi kii sarkaar baari-baari se rahi he
 Assembly is supreme in the state, if the government officials are not answering the question asked in the House for ten-ten years, then we should think afresh about the internal system of the bureaucracy to the legislature
 saath hi prashnon ke prakaar or jawaab na dene kii paristhiti kaa byora bhi saamne ho to isaki samaj or behatar ho sakegi
 The term of the four legislatures has been completed and 3000 questions have not been answered, this is not a general news
 ho saktaa he ki ab in prashnon kii praasangikta na rahi ho magar yah bhi to ho saktaa he ki unamem se kai prashn aaj bhi jawaab kaa intazaar kar rahe hon, koi sudhaar nahin aayaa ho
 In Rajasthan, members ask questions online, answers can also be found online
 hamen nahin maaloom ki maujuuda vidhansabha main abhi tak kitne prashn puche gaye hai or kitnon ke jawaab nahin mili hai
 Had it been answered, our understanding would have been better
 sadan main prashn poochne kii baqayda niyamavali bani hoti he
 How many questions can be asked, how many days have to be answered
 ek vidhayak bajet satr main 40 tarankit or 60 se adhik atarankit prashn puch saktaa he
 That is, an MLA can ask 100 questions in a budget session
 saamaanya satr main 10 tarankit or 20 atarankit prashn puch saktaa he
 For the question, the secretary has to be given at least 14 days in advance
 tarankit prashn ke jawaab sadan main maukhik rup se die jate hai
 Answers to unstarred questions are given in writing to the member
 yadi kisi din kisi prashn kaa uttar kisi kaaran nahin diya jaataa he to is prashn kaa uttar likhit rup se us din kii kaarywahi main prakashit kiya jaataa he
 How many questions a member asks during his tenure, will the MLA ask 100 of 100 questions in the budget session, i wish we would have been able to understand the accountability of the system in a better way if all these information were also part of the public debate of politics
 jab tak saare tathy na hon tab tak nahin kah sakate ki sabhi rajyon main aisa he yaa nahin
 Anurag Dwari spoke to AP Singh, Principal Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 unhone bataaya ki ek ghante ke prashn kaal main 25 sawaal rahete hai
 An attempt is made to respond verbally, which is not answered, a written reply is given
 anuraag dwari ne haal hi main ek report kii thi ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha kaa aakhri satr maatr paanch dinon ke liye bulaayaa gaya magar sadan do din hi chalaa wo bhi 5 ghante
 Shouldn't the last session be a long one, where there would be a tight book on the government's work and opposition charges within the House
 yahi nahin minuton main 11 hazaar karod kaa anupoorak bajet paas ho gaya
 Anurag says that during the 14th assembly in the parliamentary history of Madhya Pradesh, the proceedings of the House were the least
 dilli main kooda uthaane ko lekar agar supreme court ko fatkaar lagaani pade to iskaa matlab he ki jise jo kaam karnaa chahie wo apana kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court reprimanded the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 adaalat ne kaha ki kya alji ye kah rahe hai ki ve hi har maamle ke prabharee hai, superman hai lekin ve kuch bhi nahin karenge or unhen koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa he
 Everyone must have forgotten this incident and news of September 2015, but see the seriousness of the Supreme Court, till date the hearing started in the context of this incident is going on
 us vakt mukesh singh senger kii yah khabar thi ki saat saal ke avinaash raut kii dengue se maut ho gai thi
 Two hospitals refused to recruit Avinash
 avinaash ke maa baap is sadame ko bardaasht nahin kar paae
 Father Lakshmichand and mother Babita tied their hands with a dupatta and committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of the house together
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court ne khud se sangyaan liya or dilli main saaf safai or kooday ke prabandhan ko lekar sawaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 It is also a part of this report that the Central Government has spoken of action
 dilli sarkaar ne privet aspataalon ko notice bheja he
 Governments may have forgotten, but the court still remembers, but now this matter has become connected to the broader questions, touching many questions
 supreme court apni sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar or leftinent governor se poochne laga ki dilli main swasthya sevaaon ko lekar kya taiyaari he
 Meanwhile, in September 2017, a section of the garbage mountain in Ghazipur near Delhi broke down and two people died
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court kii sunwaayee main nae sawaal jud gaye
 The question came from the court that the central government should file an affidavit by asking all the states, what is the preparation for the management of solid waste across the country and who is responsible for it
 or yah bhi bataae ki gajipur ke kooday ke is dher kaa maalik koun he
 The Center, while talking to the states, filed an 850-page affidavit, to which the court said that the affidavit itself is a solid waste
 sarkaar se kaha ki behatar taiyaari ke saath dobaaraa report file kii jaae
 On Tuesday, the Supreme Court asked that within 24 hours Delhi government and LG should tell who is the owner of Delhi's garbage
 isi kaa jawaab lekar donon hajir hue the or us par bahes chal rahi thi
 The Delhi government said that it is managed by the MCD and its head is LG because if the MCD does not work, then the center can give instructions through LG
 bahes ke dauraan amisak curi ne kaha ki kooday ke dher ke prabandhan ko lekar kai baithken huin
 In which Delhi Health Minister came and LG neither came nor sent any representative
 is par adaalat kii pratikriya sakht ho gai
 The court then stated that LG considered himself Superman
 kya wo yah samajhate hai ki sanvaidhanik pad par hone ke baad kuch bhi nahin karenge
 His officers do not attend meetings
 adaalat ne kaha ki simple angreji main bataanaa he ki kooday kaa pahaad kab hatega
 On July 16, Justice Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta are scheduled to hear again in the bench
 court ne yah bhi poocha he ki dilli ke land phil yani gajipur kii tarah jitne bhi kooday ke dher hai vahaan kachra binane waalon ko pahchaan patr or unifarm kab tak di jaaegi
 All this is part of the remarks made during the debate
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne iske bare main jaankaree di he
 Ashish said that Amicus Curie Colin Gozalvis, referring to the Municipal Commissioner of Gurgaon, told the court that a good work is being done on the solid waste management in Gurgaon
 supreme court ne gudgaanv ke nigam ayukta ko bhi 16 july ke din pesh hone ko kaha he
 We often complain that the police do not work, but do we worry about how many hours our policemen work, why they have to work excessively
 bangaloru se hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne report file kii he ki karnataka main ek saal ke bheetar 150 se adhik pulicekamiyon kii duty ke dauraan maut hui he
 Most of whom have died due to heart attack, liver kidney failure
 tippaniyan Now a circular has been issued by the Karnataka Police Headquarters to the policemen to improve their fitness, reduce belly fat and get fit
 15 dinon ke bheetar is tarah ke do circular jari hue hai
 On analyzing this, it has been found that due to eating too long in buses and sitting with breakfast, overeating, standing on duty for a long time increases stress, keeping yourself fit due to less vacation
 Does not get time hamaare police vaale kaam ke atyadhik dabaav main kaam karte hai
 It has now been decided to undergo physiotherapy
 samay-samay par inaki body maas index yani motaape kii jaanch hogi
 The habit of eating alcohol and gutkha will be released
 police quarts main daal kii dukaan khulegi or daal khaane ke liye jaagruk kiya jayega
 If there is an opportunity to make the pulses aware to eat, then understand that the policemen really do not have time for the pulses
 daal ke bare main pataa to hoga hi magar do vakt khaanaa or khaane kaa samay to mili
 In 2013, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court claiming that the law and order situation in the country was deteriorating because the police service had a large number of vacancies
 is yachika main daawa kiya gaya tha ki desh bhar main kareeb saadhe paanch lakh sipaahiyon kii jagah khaali he
 India's unemployed should pay attention to this
 isi kii sunwaayee ke dauraan 24 april 2017 main supreme court ne karnataka sarkaar ne nirdesh diya tha ki vah road map bataae ki 24,889 padon par sipaahi kab behaal honge
 Nehal Kidwai said that the posts of about 23,000 policemen in Karnataka are still vacant
 kaam kaa tanaav itnaa he ki pichley ek saal main 9 pulicekarmiyon ne aatmahatya kar lee or chuttee na dene par ek sipaahi ne apane sab inspector ko goli maar di
 Therefore the reason for belly bulge is something else
 aap vidhayak yaa saansad chunate hai taaki ve sadan main aapaki samasya se sambandhit sawaal uthaa saken or sarkaar ko jawaab dene ke liye majaboor kar saken
 The answer to every question creates a new movement of accountability within the system, which is the answer that is considered more reliable
 ham maanakar chalate rahe ki jo bhi prashn puche jate honge unka jawaab vidhayakon ko mil jaataa he lekin rajasthan patrika kii ek khabar se pataa chalaa ki saare prashnon ke jawaab nahin milte hai
 Not only this, the answers to the questions asked by the mlas have been hanging from the last four assemblies and now these questions have been declared closed
 rajasthan patrika ke sunil singh sisodiya kii yah khabar maujuuda or purv vidhayakon ke liye sabak he
 According to this news, 3000 questions have been declared closed, which were asked during the tenth assembly to the 13th assembly but were pending, ie the answer was not received
 prashnon kii sankhya sutron ke hawaale se likhi gai he magar is khabar main rajasthan vidhansabha ke adhyaksh raav raaje singh kaa bhi bayaan chapa he ki lambit sawaalon kaa ab auchity nahin he
 Whose answer no one wants now
 ab unki praasangikta bhi bhi nahin he kyonki abhi chaudaavin vidhansabha astitv main he
 Is it not surprising that the departments or ministries asked questions did not consider it appropriate to reply to the Legislative Assembly
 niyamon ke mutabik vidhayak jab prashn poochhate hai to 21 dinon ke bheetar jawaab dena padataa he lekin yahaan to kai-kai saal tak jawaab dene kii zarurat mahasoos nahin kii gai
 During this period, the government of Congress and BJP has been in turn
 rajya main vidhansabha hi sarvocch hoti he agar sarkari afasar sadan main puche gaye sawaal kaa jawaab das-das saal tak nahin de rahe hai to phir hamen naukarshahi se lekar vidhayika ke bhitari system ko lekar nae sire se sochna chahie
 Also, if the details of the type of questions and the situation of not answering are also revealed, then its understanding will be better
 chaar vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal puraa ho gaya or 3000 prashnon ke jawaab hi nahin mili, yah saamaanya khabar to nahin he
 It may be that the relevance of these questions is no longer there, but it may also be that many of those questions are still waiting for answers, no improvement has come
 rajasthan main to sadsy online prashn poochhate hai, online jawaab bhi mil saktaa he
 We do not know how many questions have been asked in the current assembly so far and how many have not received answers
 iskaa uttar hota to hamaari samaj or behatar hoti
 The rules for asking questions are made in the House
 kitne prashn puch sakate hai, kitne dinon main un prashnon kaa jawaab dena hi he
 An MLA can ask 40 starred and over 60 unstarred questions in a budget session
 yani ek vidhayak ek bajet satr main 100 prashn puch saktaa he
 In a normal session, one can ask 10 starred and 20 unstarred questions
 prashn ke liye kam se kam 14 din pehle sachiv ko soochna deni hoti he
 Answers to the starred question are given orally in the House
 atarankit prashn ke jawaab sadsy ko likhit rup se die jate hai
 If a question is not answered on a given day, the answer to this question is published in writing in the proceedings of that day
 ek sadsy apane kaarykaal main kitne prashn karte hai, kya vidhayak bajet satr main 100 ke 100 prashn poochhate honge, kaash in sabaki jaankaree bhi raajnneeti ke saarvajanik bahes kaa hissaa hoti to ham system kii javabdehi ko or behatar tareeke se samaj pate
 Until all the facts are there, we cannot say whether all the states have this or not
 anuraag dwari ne madhyapradesh vidhansabha ke pramukh sachiv e pi singh se baat kii
 He said that there are 25 questions in a question hour of one hour
 maukhik rup se jawaab dene kii koshish kii jaati he, jiskaa jawaab nahin diya jaataa he uskaa likhit jawaab diya jaataa he
 Anurag Dwari recently made a report that the last session of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly was called for only five days, but the House lasted only for two days, that too for 5 hours
 kya aakhri satr lanbaa nahin hona chahie jahaan sadan ke bheetar sarkaar ke kaam or vipaksh ke aaropon par jamkar hisaab kitaab hota
 Not only this, the supplementary budget of 11 thousand crores was passed in minutes
 anuraag kaa kahana he ki madhya pradesh ke sansadeey itihaas main 14veen vidhansabha ke dauraan sadan kii kaarywahi sabase kam chali he
 If the Supreme Court has to be reprimanded for lifting garbage in Delhi, it means that the work it should do is not doing its job
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court ne dilli ke leftinent governor ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai
 The court said whether LG is saying that he is the one in charge of every case, Superman but he will do nothing and no one can touch him
 sitambar 2015 kii is ghatana or khabar ko sab bhul gaye honge, magar supreme court kii gambhirtha dekhie aaj tak is ghatana ke sandarbh main shuru hui sunwaayee kaa daur chal rahaa he
 At that time, it was reported by Mukesh Singh Sengar that seven-year-old Avinash Raut died of dengue
 do-do aspataalon ne avinaash ko bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Avinash's parents could not bear the shock
 pita lakshmichand or maa babita ne dupattey se apana haath baandha or ek saath ghar kii chauthi manzil se kud kar aatmahatya kar lee
 After this incident, the Supreme Court took cognizance of itself and started questioning the cleanliness and management of garbage in Delhi
 is report kaa yah bhi hissaa he ki centre sarkaar ne kaarywahi kii baat kahi he
 The Delhi government has sent notices to private hospitals
 sarkarein bhul gai hongi magar adaalat ko aaj bhi yaad he balki ab yah maamla kai sawaalon ko choote hue vyapak sawaalon se jud gaya he
 The Supreme Court, during its hearing, started asking the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor what the preparations were for the health services in Delhi
 isi bich sitambar 2017 main dilli ke paas gajipur ke kooday ke pahaad kaa ek hissaa tut kar neeche aa gira or do logon ko maut ho gai
 After this incident, new questions were added to the Supreme Court hearing
 adaalat kii taraf se sawaal aayaa ki centre sarkaar sabhi rajyon se puch kar halafanama file kare ki desh bhar main solid west ke prambdhan kii kya taiyaari he or iskaa zimmedaar koun he
 And also tell who is the owner of this pile of garbage from Ghazipur
 centre ne rajyon se baat kar 850 pannon kaa halafanama file kiya jis par adaalat ne kaha ki yah halafanama hi apane aap main solid west he
 Asked the government to file a report again with better preparation
 mangalvaar ko supreme court ne poocha ki 24 ghante ke bheetar dilli sarkaar or alji bataaen ki dilli ke kooday kaa maalik koun he
 Both of them attended the answer and the debate was going on
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki iskaa prabandhan emsidi karti he or iske pramukh alji hai kyonki agar emsidi kaam na kare to centre alji ke zarie nirdesh de saktaa he
 During the debate, Amisak Curie said that several meetings were held to manage the garbage dump
 jinamein dilli ke swasthya mantri aae the or alji na to aae na hi kisi pratinidhi ko bheja
 The court's response to this became stern
 tab adaalat ne kaha ki alji khud ko superman samajhate hai
 Do they understand that they will not do anything after being held constitutional post
 unke afasar meeting main nahin jate hai
 The court said that the simple English is to tell when the mountain of garbage will be removed
 16 july ko justise lokur or justise deepak gupta kii bench main phir se sunwaayee honi he
 The court has also asked how long the garbage pickers will be given identity cards and uniforms in all the garbage piles like Delhi's landfill ie Ghazipur
 yah sab bahes ke dauraan kii jane vaali tippanee kaa hissaa he
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has given information about this
 ashish ne bataaya ki amiks curi colin gozalvis ne gudgaanv ke municipal kamishnar ke bare main zikr karte hue court ko bataaya ki gudgaanv main solid west management ko lekar acha kaam ho rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has also asked the Corporation Commissioner of Gurgaon to appear on the day of 16 July
 ham aksar shikaayat karte hai ki police kaam nahin karti he lekin kya ham isaki chintaa karte hai ki hamaare pulicekarmi kitne ghante kaam karte hai, unhen kyon zarurat se zyada kaam karnaa padataa he
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai from Bangalore has filed a report that more than 150 policemen have died on duty in Karnataka within a year
 jinamein se zyaadaatar kii maut heart atake, liver kidney phelior kii vajah se hui he
 The comments ab karnataka police mukhyalay kii taraf se ek circular jari hua he ki pulicekarmi apni fitness ko behatar karen, tond kam ho or chust durust hon
 Two such circulars have been issued within 15 days
 iskaa vishleshan karne par pataa chalaa he ki bason main kaaphi der tak khaane or naashte ke saath baithe hone ke kaaran zarurat se adhik kha lete hai, duty par kaaphi der tak khadey rahane se tanaav bad jaataa he, kam chuttee ke kaaran khud ko feet rakhane kaa vakt nahin miltaa he
 Our policemen work under extreme pressure of work
 ab inaki phisiotherapy karaane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 From time to time, their body mass index i
e
 obesity will be examined
 sharaab or gutkha khaane kii aadat chhudvaai jaaegi
 The Police Quartus will open a lentil shop and be made aware to eat lentils
 agar daal khaane ke liye jaagruk karne kii naubat aa jaae to samajhie ki vaaki police waalon ke paas daal ke liye bhi vakt nahin he
 You will know about lentils, but you should have time to eat and eat two times
 2013 main supreme court main ek yachika daayar hui thi jisamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki desh main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat isliye kharaab ho rahi he kyonki police seva main badi sankhya main vaikency he
 In this petition, it was claimed that the place of about five and a half lakh soldiers across the country is empty
 bharat ke berojgaar is par dhyaan den
 During this hearing, on 24 April 2017, the Supreme Court had directed the Karnataka government to give a road map as to when the soldiers would be reinstated on 24,889 posts
 nehaal kidawai ne bataaya ki karnataka main kareeb 23 hazaar pulicekarmiyon ke pad ab bhi khaali hai
 The stress of work is so much that in the last one year 9 policemen committed suicide and a soldier shot his sub inspector when he was not discharged
 isliye tond kaa kaaran kuch or bhi he
 This news of Sunil Singh Sisodia of Rajasthan Patrika is a lesson for the current and former mlas
 is khabar ke mutabik 3000 prashnon ko samaapt ghoshit kar diya gaya he jo dasvin vidhansabha se lekar 13veen vidhansabha ke dauraan puche gaye magar lambit rahe yani jinka jawaab nahin mila

 Anurag Dwari spoke to AP Singh, Principal Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly
 unhone bataaya ki ek ghante ke prashn kaal main 25 sawaal rahete hai
 An attempt is made to respond verbally, which is not answered, a written reply is given
 anuraag dwari ne haal hi main ek report kii thi ki madhya pradesh vidhansabha kaa aakhri satr maatr paanch dinon ke liye bulaayaa gaya magar sadan do din hi chalaa wo bhi 5 ghante
 Shouldn't the last session be a long one, where there would be a tight book on the government's work and opposition charges within the House
 yahi nahin minuton main 11 hazaar karod kaa anupoorak bajet paas ho gaya
 Anurag says that during the 14th assembly in the parliamentary history of Madhya Pradesh, the proceedings of the House were the least
 dilli main kooda uthaane ko lekar agar supreme court ko fatkaar lagaani pade to iskaa matlab he ki jise jo kaam karnaa chahie wo apana kaam nahin kar rahaa he
 On Thursday, the Supreme Court reprimanded the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 adaalat ne kaha ki kya alji ye kah rahe hai ki ve hi har maamle ke prabharee hai, superman hai lekin ve kuch bhi nahin karenge or unhen koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa he
 Everyone must have forgotten this incident and news of September 2015, but see the seriousness of the Supreme Court, till date the hearing started in the context of this incident is going on
 us vakt mukesh singh senger kii yah khabar thi ki saat saal ke avinaash raut kii dengue se maut ho gai thi
 Two hospitals refused to recruit Avinash
 avinaash ke maa baap is sadame ko bardaasht nahin kar paae
 Father Lakshmichand and mother Babita tied their hands with a dupatta and committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of the house together
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court ne khud se sangyaan liya or dilli main saaf safai or kooday ke prabandhan ko lekar sawaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 It is also a part of this report that the Central Government has spoken of action
 dilli sarkaar ne privet aspataalon ko notice bheja he
 Governments may have forgotten, but the court still remembers, but now this matter has become connected to the broader questions, touching many questions
 supreme court apni sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar or leftinent governor se poochne laga ki dilli main swasthya sevaaon ko lekar kya taiyaari he
 Meanwhile, in September 2017, a section of the garbage mountain in Ghazipur near Delhi broke down and two people died
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court kii sunwaayee main nae sawaal jud gaye
 The question came from the court that the central government should file an affidavit by asking all the states, what is the preparation for the management of solid waste across the country and who is responsible for it
 or yah bhi bataae ki gajipur ke kooday ke is dher kaa maalik koun he
 The Center, while talking to the states, filed an 850-page affidavit, to which the court said that the affidavit itself is a solid waste
 sarkaar se kaha ki behatar taiyaari ke saath dobaaraa report file kii jaae
 On Tuesday, the Supreme Court asked that within 24 hours Delhi government and LG should tell who is the owner of Delhi's garbage
 isi kaa jawaab lekar donon hajir hue the or us par bahes chal rahi thi
 The Delhi government said that it is managed by the MCD and its head is LG because if the MCD does not work, then the center can give instructions through LG
 bahes ke dauraan amisak curi ne kaha ki kooday ke dher ke prabandhan ko lekar kai baithken huin
 In which Delhi Health Minister came and LG neither came nor sent any representative
 is par adaalat kii pratikriya sakht ho gai
 The court then stated that LG considered himself Superman
 kya wo yah samajhate hai ki sanvaidhanik pad par hone ke baad kuch bhi nahin karenge
 His officers do not attend meetings
 adaalat ne kaha ki simple angreji main bataanaa he ki kooday kaa pahaad kab hatega
 On July 16, Justice Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta are scheduled to hear again in the bench
 court ne yah bhi poocha he ki dilli ke land phil yani gajipur kii tarah jitne bhi kooday ke dher hai vahaan kachra binane waalon ko pahchaan patr or unifarm kab tak di jaaegi
 All this is part of the remarks made during the debate
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne iske bare main jaankaree di he
 Ashish said that Amicus Curie Colin Gozalvis, referring to the Municipal Commissioner of Gurgaon, told the court that a good work is being done on the solid waste management in Gurgaon
 supreme court ne gudgaanv ke nigam ayukta ko bhi 16 july ke din pesh hone ko kaha he
 We often complain that the police do not work, but do we worry about how many hours our policemen work, why they have to work excessively
 bangaloru se hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne report file kii he ki karnataka main ek saal ke bheetar 150 se adhik pulicekamiyon kii duty ke dauraan maut hui he
 Most of whom have died due to heart attack, liver kidney failure
 tippaniyan Now a circular has been issued by the Karnataka Police Headquarters to the policemen to improve their fitness, reduce belly fat and get fit
 15 dinon ke bheetar is tarah ke do circular jari hue hai
 On analyzing this, it has been found that due to eating too long in buses and sitting with breakfast, overeating, standing on duty for a long time increases stress, keeping yourself fit due to less vacation
 Does not get time hamaare police vaale kaam ke atyadhik dabaav main kaam karte hai
 It has now been decided to undergo physiotherapy
 samay-samay par inaki body maas index yani motaape kii jaanch hogi
 The habit of eating alcohol and gutkha will be released
 police quarts main daal kii dukaan khulegi or daal khaane ke liye jaagruk kiya jayega
 If there is an opportunity to make the pulses aware to eat, then understand that the policemen really do not have time for the pulses
 daal ke bare main pataa to hoga hi magar do vakt khaanaa or khaane kaa samay to mili
 In 2013, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court claiming that the law and order situation in the country was deteriorating because the police service had a large number of vacancies
 is yachika main daawa kiya gaya tha ki desh bhar main kareeb saadhe paanch lakh sipaahiyon kii jagah khaali he
 India's unemployed should pay attention to this
 isi kii sunwaayee ke dauraan 24 april 2017 main supreme court ne karnataka sarkaar ne nirdesh diya tha ki vah road map bataae ki 24,889 padon par sipaahi kab behaal honge
 Nehal Kidwai said that the posts of about 23,000 policemen in Karnataka are still vacant
 kaam kaa tanaav itnaa he ki pichley ek saal main 9 pulicekarmiyon ne aatmahatya kar lee or chuttee na dene par ek sipaahi ne apane sab inspector ko goli maar di
 Therefore the reason for belly bulge is something else
 chaar vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal puraa ho gaya or 3000 prashnon ke jawaab hi nahin mili, yah saamaanya khabar to nahin he
 It may be that the relevance of these questions is no longer there, but it may also be that many of those questions are still waiting for answers, no improvement has come
 rajasthan main to sadsy online prashn poochhate hai, online jawaab bhi mil saktaa he
 We do not know how many questions have been asked in the current assembly so far and how many have not received answers
 iskaa uttar hota to hamaari samaj or behatar hoti
 The rules for asking questions are made in the House
 kitne prashn puch sakate hai, kitne dinon main un prashnon kaa jawaab dena hi he
 An MLA can ask 40 starred and over 60 unstarred questions in a budget session
 yani ek vidhayak ek bajet satr main 100 prashn puch saktaa he
 In a normal session, one can ask 10 starred and 20 unstarred questions
 prashn ke liye kam se kam 14 din pehle sachiv ko soochna deni hoti he
 Answers to the starred question are given orally in the House
 atarankit prashn ke jawaab sadsy ko likhit rup se die jate hai
 If a question is not answered on a given day, the answer to this question is published in writing in the proceedings of that day
 ek sadsy apane kaarykaal main kitne prashn karte hai, kya vidhayak bajet satr main 100 ke 100 prashn poochhate honge, kaash in sabaki jaankaree bhi raajnneeti ke saarvajanik bahes kaa hissaa hoti to ham system kii javabdehi ko or behatar tareeke se samaj pate
 Until all the facts are there, we cannot say whether all the states have this or not
 anuraag dwari ne madhyapradesh vidhansabha ke pramukh sachiv e pi singh se baat kii
 He said that there are 25 questions in a question hour of one hour
 maukhik rup se jawaab dene kii koshish kii jaati he, jiskaa jawaab nahin diya jaataa he uskaa likhit jawaab diya jaataa he
 Anurag Dwari recently made a report that the last session of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly was called for only five days, but the House lasted only for two days, that too for 5 hours
 kya aakhri satr lanbaa nahin hona chahie jahaan sadan ke bheetar sarkaar ke kaam or vipaksh ke aaropon par jamkar hisaab kitaab hota
 Not only this, the supplementary budget of 11 thousand crores was passed in minutes
 anuraag kaa kahana he ki madhya pradesh ke sansadeey itihaas main 14veen vidhansabha ke dauraan sadan kii kaarywahi sabase kam chali he
 If the Supreme Court has to be reprimanded for lifting garbage in Delhi, it means that the work it should do is not doing its job
 guuruuvaar ko supreme court ne dilli ke leftinent governor ko jamkar fatkaar lagaai
 The court said whether LG is saying that he is the one in charge of every case, Superman but he will do nothing and no one can touch him
 sitambar 2015 kii is ghatana or khabar ko sab bhul gaye honge, magar supreme court kii gambhirtha dekhie aaj tak is ghatana ke sandarbh main shuru hui sunwaayee kaa daur chal rahaa he
 At that time, it was reported by Mukesh Singh Sengar that seven-year-old Avinash Raut died of dengue
 do-do aspataalon ne avinaash ko bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Avinash's parents could not bear the shock
 pita lakshmichand or maa babita ne dupattey se apana haath baandha or ek saath ghar kii chauthi manzil se kud kar aatmahatya kar lee
 After this incident, the Supreme Court took cognizance of itself and started questioning the cleanliness and management of garbage in Delhi
 is report kaa yah bhi hissaa he ki centre sarkaar ne kaarywahi kii baat kahi he
 The Delhi government has sent notices to private hospitals
 sarkarein bhul gai hongi magar adaalat ko aaj bhi yaad he balki ab yah maamla kai sawaalon ko choote hue vyapak sawaalon se jud gaya he
 The Supreme Court, during its hearing, started asking the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor what the preparations were for the health services in Delhi
 isi bich sitambar 2017 main dilli ke paas gajipur ke kooday ke pahaad kaa ek hissaa tut kar neeche aa gira or do logon ko maut ho gai
 After this incident, new questions were added to the Supreme Court hearing
 adaalat kii taraf se sawaal aayaa ki centre sarkaar sabhi rajyon se puch kar halafanama file kare ki desh bhar main solid west ke prambdhan kii kya taiyaari he or iskaa zimmedaar koun he
 And also tell who is the owner of this pile of garbage from Ghazipur
 centre ne rajyon se baat kar 850 pannon kaa halafanama file kiya jis par adaalat ne kaha ki yah halafanama hi apane aap main solid west he
 Asked the government to file a report again with better preparation
 mangalvaar ko supreme court ne poocha ki 24 ghante ke bheetar dilli sarkaar or alji bataaen ki dilli ke kooday kaa maalik koun he
 Both of them attended the answer and the debate was going on
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki iskaa prabandhan emsidi karti he or iske pramukh alji hai kyonki agar emsidi kaam na kare to centre alji ke zarie nirdesh de saktaa he
 During the debate, Amisak Curie said that several meetings were held to manage the garbage dump
 jinamein dilli ke swasthya mantri aae the or alji na to aae na hi kisi pratinidhi ko bheja
 The court's response to this became stern
 tab adaalat ne kaha ki alji khud ko superman samajhate hai
 Do they understand that they will not do anything after being held constitutional post
 unke afasar meeting main nahin jate hai
 The court said that the simple English is to tell when the mountain of garbage will be removed
 16 july ko justise lokur or justise deepak gupta kii bench main phir se sunwaayee honi he
 The court has also asked how long the garbage pickers will be given identity cards and uniforms in all the garbage piles like Delhi's landfill ie Ghazipur
 yah sab bahes ke dauraan kii jane vaali tippanee kaa hissaa he
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava has given information about this
 ashish ne bataaya ki amiks curi colin gozalvis ne gudgaanv ke municipal kamishnar ke bare main zikr karte hue court ko bataaya ki gudgaanv main solid west management ko lekar acha kaam ho rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has also asked the Corporation Commissioner of Gurgaon to appear on the day of 16 July
 ham aksar shikaayat karte hai ki police kaam nahin karti he lekin kya ham isaki chintaa karte hai ki hamaare pulicekarmi kitne ghante kaam karte hai, unhen kyon zarurat se zyada kaam karnaa padataa he
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai from Bangalore has filed a report that more than 150 policemen have died on duty in Karnataka within a year
 jinamein se zyaadaatar kii maut heart atake, liver kidney phelior kii vajah se hui he
 The comments ab karnataka police mukhyalay kii taraf se ek circular jari hua he ki pulicekarmi apni fitness ko behatar karen, tond kam ho or chust durust hon
 Two such circulars have been issued within 15 days
 iskaa vishleshan karne par pataa chalaa he ki bason main kaaphi der tak khaane or naashte ke saath baithe hone ke kaaran zarurat se adhik kha lete hai, duty par kaaphi der tak khadey rahane se tanaav bad jaataa he, kam chuttee ke kaaran khud ko feet rakhane kaa vakt nahin miltaa he
 Our policemen work under extreme pressure of work
 ab inaki phisiotherapy karaane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 From time to time, their body mass index i
e
 obesity will be examined
 sharaab or gutkha khaane kii aadat chhudvaai jaaegi
 The Police Quartus will open a lentil shop and be made aware to eat lentils
 agar daal khaane ke liye jaagruk karne kii naubat aa jaae to samajhie ki vaaki police waalon ke paas daal ke liye bhi vakt nahin he
 You will know about lentils, but you should have time to eat and eat two times
 2013 main supreme court main ek yachika daayar hui thi jisamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki desh main kanoon vyavastha kii haalat isliye kharaab ho rahi he kyonki police seva main badi sankhya main vaikency he
 In this petition, it was claimed that the place of about five and a half lakh soldiers across the country is empty
 bharat ke berojgaar is par dhyaan den
 During this hearing, on 24 April 2017, the Supreme Court had directed the Karnataka government to give a road map as to when the soldiers would be reinstated on 24,889 posts
 nehaal kidawai ne bataaya ki karnataka main kareeb 23 hazaar pulicekarmiyon ke pad ab bhi khaali hai
 The stress of work is so much that in the last one year 9 policemen committed suicide and a soldier shot his sub inspector when he was not discharged
 isliye tond kaa kaaran kuch or bhi he
 In Rajasthan, members ask questions online, answers can also be found online
 hamen nahin maaloom ki maujuuda vidhansabha main abhi tak kitne prashn puche gaye hai or kitnon ke jawaab nahin mili hai
 Had it been answered, our understanding would have been better
 sadan main prashn poochne kii baqayda niyamavali bani hoti he
 How many questions can be asked, how many days have to be answered
 ek vidhayak bajet satr main 40 tarankit or 60 se adhik atarankit prashn puch saktaa he
 That is, an MLA can ask 100 questions in a budget session
 saamaanya satr main 10 tarankit or 20 atarankit prashn puch saktaa he
 For the question, the secretary has to be given at least 14 days in advance
 tarankit prashn ke jawaab sadan main maukhik rup se die jate hai
 Answers to unstarred questions are given in writing to the member
 yadi kisi din kisi prashn kaa uttar kisi kaaran nahin diya jaataa he to is prashn kaa uttar likhit rup se us din kii kaarywahi main prakashit kiya jaataa he
 How many questions a member asks during his tenure, will the MLA ask 100 of 100 questions in the budget session, i wish we would have been able to understand the accountability of the system in a better way if all these information were also part of the public debate of politics
 jab tak saare tathy na hon tab tak nahin kah sakate ki sabhi rajyon main aisa he yaa nahin
 Anurag Dwari spoke to AP Singh, Principal Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly

 Nehal Kidwai said that the posts of about 23,000 policemen in Karnataka are still vacant
 kaam kaa tanaav itnaa he ki pichley ek saal main 9 pulicekarmiyon ne aatmahatya kar lee or chuttee na dene par ek sipaahi ne apane sab inspector ko goli maar di
 Therefore the reason for belly bulge is something else

 At that time, it was reported by Mukesh Singh Sengar that seven-year-old Avinash Raut died of dengue
 do-do aspataalon ne avinaash ko bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 Avinash's parents could not bear the shock
 pita lakshmichand or maa babita ne dupattey se apana haath baandha or ek saath ghar kii chauthi manzil se kud kar aatmahatya kar lee
 After this incident, the Supreme Court took cognizance of itself and started questioning the cleanliness and management of garbage in Delhi

 The Delhi government has sent notices to private hospitals

 Asked the government to file a report again with better preparation
 mangalvaar ko supreme court ne poocha ki 24 ghante ke bheetar dilli sarkaar or alji bataaen ki dilli ke kooday kaa maalik koun he
 Both of them attended the answer and the debate was going on
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki iskaa prabandhan emsidi karti he or iske pramukh alji hai kyonki agar emsidi kaam na kare to centre alji ke zarie nirdesh de saktaa he
 During the debate, Amisak Curie said that several meetings were held to manage the garbage dump
 jinamein dilli ke swasthya mantri aae the or alji na to aae na hi kisi pratinidhi ko bheja
 The court's response to this became stern
 tab adaalat ne kaha ki alji khud ko superman samajhate hai
 Do they understand that they will not do anything after being held constitutional post
 unke afasar meeting main nahin jate hai
 The court said that the simple English is to tell when the mountain of garbage will be removed
 16 july ko justise lokur or justise deepak gupta kii bench main phir se sunwaayee honi he
 The court has also asked how long the garbage pickers will be given identity cards and uniforms in all the garbage piles like Delhi's landfill ie Ghazipur

 Everyone must have forgotten this incident and news of September 2015, but see the seriousness of the Supreme Court, till date the hearing started in the context of this incident is going on
 us vakt mukesh singh senger kii yah khabar thi ki saat saal ke avinaash raut kii dengue se maut ho gai thi
 Two hospitals refused to recruit Avinash
 avinaash ke maa baap is sadame ko bardaasht nahin kar paae
 Father Lakshmichand and mother Babita tied their hands with a dupatta and committed suicide by jumping from the fourth floor of the house together
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court ne khud se sangyaan liya or dilli main saaf safai or kooday ke prabandhan ko lekar sawaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 It is also a part of this report that the Central Government has spoken of action
 dilli sarkaar ne privet aspataalon ko notice bheja he
 Governments may have forgotten, but the court still remembers, but now this matter has become connected to the broader questions, touching many questions
 supreme court apni sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar or leftinent governor se poochne laga ki dilli main swasthya sevaaon ko lekar kya taiyaari he
 Meanwhile, in September 2017, a section of the garbage mountain in Ghazipur near Delhi broke down and two people died
 is ghatana ke baad supreme court kii sunwaayee main nae sawaal jud gaye
 The question came from the court that the central government should file an affidavit by asking all the states, what is the preparation for the management of solid waste across the country and who is responsible for it
 or yah bhi bataae ki gajipur ke kooday ke is dher kaa maalik koun he
 The Center, while talking to the states, filed an 850-page affidavit, to which the court said that the affidavit itself is a solid waste
 sarkaar se kaha ki behatar taiyaari ke saath dobaaraa report file kii jaae
 On Tuesday, the Supreme Court asked that within 24 hours Delhi government and LG should tell who is the owner of Delhi's garbage
 isi kaa jawaab lekar donon hajir hue the or us par bahes chal rahi thi
 The Delhi government said that it is managed by the MCD and its head is LG because if the MCD does not work, then the center can give instructions through LG
 bahes ke dauraan amisak curi ne kaha ki kooday ke dher ke prabandhan ko lekar kai baithken huin
 In which Delhi Health Minister came and LG neither came nor sent any representative
 is par adaalat kii pratikriya sakht ho gai
 The court then stated that LG considered himself Superman
 kya wo yah samajhate hai ki sanvaidhanik pad par hone ke baad kuch bhi nahin karenge
 His officers do not attend meetings
 adaalat ne kaha ki simple angreji main bataanaa he ki kooday kaa pahaad kab hatega
 On July 16, Justice Lokur and Justice Deepak Gupta are scheduled to hear again in the bench
 court ne yah bhi poocha he ki dilli ke land phil yani gajipur kii tarah jitne bhi kooday ke dher hai vahaan kachra binane waalon ko pahchaan patr or unifarm kab tak di jaaegi
 All this is part of the remarks made during the debate
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne iske bare main jaankaree di he
 Ashish said that Amicus Curie Colin Gozalvis, referring to the Municipal Commissioner of Gurgaon, told the court that a good work is being done on the solid waste management in Gurgaon
 supreme court ne gudgaanv ke nigam ayukta ko bhi 16 july ke din pesh hone ko kaha he
 We often complain that the police do not work, but do we worry about how many hours our policemen work, why they have to work excessively
 bangaloru se hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne report file kii he ki karnataka main ek saal ke bheetar 150 se adhik pulicekamiyon kii duty ke dauraan maut hui he
 Most of whom have died due to heart attack, liver kidney failure
 tippaniyan Now a circular has been issued by the Karnataka Police Headquarters to the policemen to improve their fitness, reduce belly fat and get fit
 15 dinon ke bheetar is tarah ke do circular jari hue hai
 On analyzing this, it has been found that due to eating too long in buses and sitting with breakfast, overeating, standing on duty for a long time increases stress, keeping yourself fit due to less vacation
 Does not get time hamaare police vaale kaam ke atyadhik dabaav main kaam karte hai
 It has now been decided to undergo physiotherapy
 samay-samay par inaki body maas index yani motaape kii jaanch hogi
 The habit of eating alcohol and gutkha will be released
 police quarts main daal kii dukaan khulegi or daal khaane ke liye jaagruk kiya jayega
 If there is an opportunity to make the pulses aware to eat, then understand that the policemen really do not have time for the pulses
 daal ke bare main pataa to hoga hi magar do vakt khaanaa or khaane kaa samay to mili
 In 2013, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court claiming that the law and order situation in the country was deteriorating because the police service had a large number of vacancies
 is yachika main daawa kiya gaya tha ki desh bhar main kareeb saadhe paanch lakh sipaahiyon kii jagah khaali he
 India's unemployed should pay attention to this
 isi kii sunwaayee ke dauraan 24 april 2017 main supreme court ne karnataka sarkaar ne nirdesh diya tha ki vah road map bataae ki 24,889 padon par sipaahi kab behaal honge

 Although the Aam Aadmi Party fielded its candidates in all seats, the party did not win the election
 gauratlab he ki rajdhani dilli main sabhi siton par chathe charan main yani 12 may ko vot daale jaaenge jabaki 23 may ko nattejey aaenge
 At present, all seats in Delhi are occupied by the BJP, although the Aam Aadmi Party won a big victory in the assembly elections and Arvind Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi

 He was miles ahead of everyone as a speaker
 india shining or media kaa maahaul bijepi may tha
 The Congress did not appear to come from anywhere
 vahiin sonia gandhi bhaashan to dur thik se hindi nahin bol paati thim
 Many big leaders of the Congress were leaving the party
 party ke ranneetikaron ko lagata he ki aaj bhi kamobesh vaise hi halaat hai

 Under which Sonia formed the government under the leadership of Congress in 2004 by ousting the Vajpayee government
 yani ab rahul usee raste brands modi se takaraana chaahate hai, jaise sonia brands atal se takaraai thim
 These will be the next 5 steps
 
 
 1
 Like UP, Rahul will not come face to face in small or state elections himself
 2
 Along with the failures of the central government, raising the issues of the state prominently will lead to a political fight
 isamen congress rajya ke netaaon ke jariye bijepi ke rajya ke netritv se sidhe takaraayegi
 On the lines of Punjab, Rahul will campaign in a limited role
 3
 Meanwhile, Rahul will strengthen his hold on the organization
 rajyon main safalataa milane se unki chhavi bhi sudharegi
 Also, by 2019, the benefit of anti-incumbency rising against the center will also improve Rahul's image
 4
 Rahul, meanwhile, will work towards building state-wise alliances under the strategy
 iske alaava bhrashtachar ko lekar party kii behatar chhavi banane ke liye kadam uthaate dikhenge
 5
 is bich rahul kii ek or badi koshish party kii or khud kii muslim tushtikaran kii chhavi kii todane kii rahegi
 Steps towards soft Hindutva will be seen
 isi ranneeti ke tahat congress himachal, gujarat, karnataka, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan ke aane walevidhansabha chunaav main utarane kii taiyaarikar rahi he
 Actually, he feels that in the small elections, BJP is succeeding in winning the battle of Brand Modi vs Brand Rahul
 isse brands rahul ko chot pahunchati he
 Also the leadership of the state BJP and the issues of the states are left behind
 bijepi anti inakambency se bhi batch jaati he
 As seen in Delhi MCD and UP elections
 kul milakar 2019 ke liecongress ab nai ranneeti ke saathutarane kii taiyaari main he
 But, she has to remember that till now she has not been able to win any election by directly colliding with Modi

 # thugsofhindostan: DISAPPOINTING
 Rating: ⭐️⭐️all that glitters is NOT gold
 
 
 Holds true for # TOH
 
 
 Some engrossing moments in the first hour, that’s about it
 
 
 Formula-ridden plot, screenplay of convenience, shoddy direction are the main culprits
 
 
 👎👎👎— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)november 8, 2018heard that Amir Khan has over acted a lot in # thugsofhindostan

 maamle kii jaanch kar rahe police adhikariyon ne yah jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki forensik jaanch se pushti ho chuki he ki jin uttarpustikaon ke boote rubi ko sheersh sthaan hasil hua, ve kisi or kii likhi hui thim, kyonki un uttarpustikaon par maujuud hastlekh (handriting) rubi ke hastlekh se nahin miltaa

 Police sources have said that the 17-year-old Ruby confessed to the crime during interrogation, stating that she only wanted to pass the 12th standard exam, and it was never her motive to top it

 In 'aaj Tak' program 'sachin Sachin', he said that Dhoni's reputation for being the best finisher in the world had been damaged due to his poor form for a long time, but he has made a strong comeback by playing some quick innings during the Asia Cup
 paripakv hue hai dhonitendulkar ne kaha, 'duniya kaa koi bhi khilaadi apane puure jivan ke dauraan acchhee form main nahin rah saktaa kyonki vah mashin nahin he
 When i heard the sound of Dhoni's bat hitting the ball, i realized that it was a different sound
 yah aawaaj aapse kah rahi he kiballebaaj kii maansikta badal gaihai
 "he said," Dhoni's most important thing is his ability to withstand pressure, which makes him a good captain
 varshon se vah paripakv hua he
 When he is under stress, he still does not show which is a good sign
 adhiktar agar captain jhallane vaala hota he yaa nervas ho jaataa he to team main dar paidaa ho jaataa he lekin dhoni ke saath aisa nahin he
 'yuvi's footwork can be important, Bumrah may be' game changer 'yuvraj has also indicated his return to form and Tendulkar said about him,' During the Asia Cup i saw that his mindset has changed which is good for India
 
 dhoni kii tarah hi balle ke gend se takaraane ke dauraan aane vaali aawaaj mere liye mahatvapurn he lekin sabase ahm yuvi kaa footwork he
 As far as 'game changer' is concerned, i think Jasprit Bumrah could be that player for India in the World T20
 uskaa ection bhram main daalane vaala he or dhimaa lag saktaa he lekin gend soch se adhik teji se balle se takaraati he
 Tendulkar said that the best thing about the Indian team is flexibility
 bharat ko pareshaan kar saktaa he englandschin kii najar main england, austrailia,bharat or dakshin africa semifinal menjagah bana sakate hai jabaki england kii team bharat ko sabase zyada pareshaan kar sakati he
 He said, "although Australia bowling may not have the same depth as before, it is still good
" ballebaaji kaaphi acchhee he jo use acchhee team banaati he
 South Africa may not have performed well in important matches but they have AB de Villiers
 ' tendulkar ne kaha, 'england kii team kaaphi acchhee he jisamen achche tii20 khilaadi hai
 i like his bowling attack
 moin ali acha spinner he jise pataa he ki use kisi gendbaaji kerani he
 He creates effective strategies
 iske alaava unke paas leg spinner adil raashid bhi he
 Although India is not afraid of anyone but the England team may put him in some concern

 The Supreme Court had sought the removal of the High Court ban imposed on the criminal case against Yeddyurappa and his family for irregularities in the exclusion of land from the notified category
 or bhi hai ghotaale!karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi es yediurppa par lagaataar ghotaalon ke aarope lagate rahe hai
 In the month of March this year, senior JD (S) leader HD Kumaraswamy alleged that Yeddyurappa's son was funded by several companies and the government of the state acted as those companies
 unhone (kumaraswami ne) dastavej jari karke daawa kiya he ki yediurppa sanchalit ek shikshan trust ko aadhikarik paksh ke liye vibhinn companiyon kii ore se 27 karod rupee kaa anudaan mila he
 The grantee companies also include those companies which are incurring losses

 In return, the Yeddyurappa government benefited these companies
 in aaropon ke mutabik 2008 se 2010 ke bich prerana trust ko 27 karod 18 lakh rupee die gaye
 Among the companies that donated to Yeddyurappa's son's trust were Adarsh developers, Industrial Techno Manpower Services Private Limited, Jai Bharti Technical Private Limited, Real Technical Solutions Private Limited and South West Mining Limited

 The opposition also alleges that the Chief Minister took a bribe of Rs 20 crore from South West Mining Limited in Bellary

 Chief Minister's grudge on disqualified mlas
 Now on May 13, the Supreme Court has given a big blow to the ruling BJP of Karnataka
 supreme court ne vidhansabha adhyaksh ke us vivaadaaspad faisle ko radd kar diya jisamen unhone pichley saal oktober main avishvaas prastaav se pehle 16 vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraaya tha or iske chalate yediurppa kii sarkaar batch gayi thi
 The Karnataka High Court had on October 29 last year ratified the Speaker's decision of disqualification of 11 rebel BJP mlas
 upachunaav main jite bhaajapa ummidavaaris bich karnataka main9 april 2011 ko hue upachunaav main sattarudh bhartiya janata party ne teenon siton par aasaan jeet hasil kar lee
 The result of this election brought the bjp's tally to 109 in the 224-member assembly
 bhaajapa ko ek nirdaleey vidhayak kaa samarthan pehle se mila hua he
 Soon after, Chief Minister Yeddyurappa issued a statement saying that now he has got the support of 11 rebel mlas too and the Governor can prove his majority in the House whenever he wants
 upachunaav main teen siten jeetne ke baad karnataka vidhansabha main bijepi ke vidhayakon kii sankhya 109 ho gai he
 There are 71 Congress and 26 JDS mlas in the House
 224 siton vaali vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aankada 113 he or bijepi ke 11 baagiyon ne phir se party ko samarthan dekar yediurppa kaa kaam aasaan kar diya he
 The fight with the Governor continued, but the real ruckus arose when the Governor sent a special report to the Center and recommended imposition of President's rule in Karnataka
 iske baad mukhyamantri yediurppa ne desh kii raashtrapati ko chitthee likhaa ki unki sarkaar ke khilaaf kisi kism kii sajeesh na ho
 However, despite the recommendation of the Governor, the central government has not been able to take a decision on imposing President's rule
 isse pehle bhi rajyapal hansraj bharadwaj ne oktober 2010 main rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish kii thi jise centre sarkaar ne nahin mana tha
 However, amid the political war that started after the recommendation of imposition of President's rule, Bhardwaj and Yeddyurappa also showed some friendly attitude towards each other
 yediurppa ne ab 2 june se shuru hone vaale vidhansabha satr kii anumati kii maang kii he or kaha he ki agar anumati nahin mili to vah khuli jeep main rajyavyapee daura shuru kar denge or janamat jutaney ke liye reliyon ko sambodhit karenge
 At the same time, BJP has demanded the immediate removal of the Governor of Karnataka Hansraj Bhardwaj
 bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki lagaataar rajya sarkaar ke virodh se prathit hota he ki bharadwaj congress ke ‘agent’ ke taur par kaam rahe hai isliye unka is pad par bane rahanaa kisi bhi tarah se uchit nahin he
 Judge Shyam Lal of Ghaziabad's special CBI court on Tuesday sentenced aarushi-hemraj murder convict Rajesh and Nupur Talwar to life imprisonment under Section 302 of IPC
 iske alaava dhara 201 ek tahat donon ko paanch-paanch saal kii sajaa sunai gai he
 At the same time, Rajesh Talwar has also been given an additional one-year sentence under section 203
 adaalat ne rajesh talwaar par 17 hajaar or noopur talwaar par 15 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya
 Upon receiving information about the sentence from the court, a look of remorse was seen on the Talwar couple's face
 rajesh talwaar ko dasna jail ke ward number 11 or noopur talwaar ko ward number 13 main rakhaa gaya he
 Rajesh Talwar will now be identified as prisoner number 9342 within the jail
 noopur talwaar hongi kaidi number 9343
 Earlier, the court on Monday convicted Nupur and Rajesh Talwar for the murder of daughters Aarushi and Hemraj
 padhein: is murder mistry main kab kya hua
 
 
 The sentence was debated at 2:10 pm before the sentencing was announced
 is dauraan sibiai ke vakil aarake saini ne kaha ki yah maamla reirest of da rer kii shrenee main aata he, kyonki may 2008 main aarushi or naukar hemraj talwaar danpati ke noida sthit ghar main mrit paae gaye the or unke gale rete hue the, isliye rajesh or noopur talwaar ko sajaa-e-maut milani chahie
 At the same time, the defense counsel appealed to Rahm for the Talwar couple, saying that there is no criminal record of their clients
 unhone kaha ki cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan jo bhi baaten kahin gayi hai wo sirf kahani bhi ho sakati he kyonki is cese main koi gavaah nahin he
 Whatever was the result of momentary charge on the night of the incident, this case cannot be considered as rarest of the rare
 noopur kii tabiyat bigadivahin, dasna jail main noopur talwaar kii mangalvaar subah tabiyat kharaab ho gai
 His blood pressure suddenly increased and he got acidity
 doctoron ne court bhejne se pehle unki jaanch kii or unhen dawa di
 Actually, Nupur had not eaten food in the jail on Monday night, after which the jail superintendent asked him to eat and said that action would be taken against him if he did not listen
 iske baad noopur ne khaanaa to khaaya, lekin vah raatbhar soi nahin or bich-bich main uthati raheen
 The doctor says that this is the reason that as his BP increased, he also got acidity problem
 adaalat ne lagaai ye dharaindalat ne donon ko ipisi kii dhara 302 (hatya ) ke tahat doshi tehraaya he
 Apart from this, Rajesh Talwar has been convicted under Sections 203 (guilty of filing an incorrect FIR), 201 (erasing of evidence) and 34 (common Intention) of IPC
 vahiin, noopur ko 302 ke alaava dhara 201 or 34 ke tahat doshi tehraaya he
 We did not kill Aarushi: After the Talwars couple, a statement has been released in the media on behalf of Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, saying that they are unhappy with the verdict
 bayaan ke mutabik, 'ham faisle se bahut dukhi hai
 We have been held responsible for a crime we did not commit
 lekin ham haar nahin maanenge or nyaay ke liye ladaai jari rakhenge
 "an attempt to save the dignity of the CBI", a relative of the Talwar couple said after the verdict, "what was the need of the trial
" logon ko pehle se pataa tha kya hone vaala he
 To preserve the dignity of the CBI, truth was suppressed in layers of lies
 ' udhar, bachaav paksh ke vakil ne is faisle ko galat mana he
 He said that it is illegal
 talwaar danpati kii vakil rebeka jon ne kaha he ki ve faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt main apil karenge
 Aarushi massacre So far, on 16 May 2008, after the murder of Aarushi, her father Rajesh Talwar was arrested on 23 May 2008
 is hiprophile cese ne police ko chaka kar rakh diya
 The police kept changing statements repeatedly and the case was unable to reach any conclusion, after which the case was handed over to the CBI on 31 May 2008
 june main rajesh talwaar ke compounder krishna ko sibiai ne giraftaar kar liya gaya
 10 days later, Rajkumar and Vijay Mandal, servants of Talwar's friend, were also taken into custody by the police
 sibiai jaanch kar rahi thi, lekin disbanr 2010 main aakhirkaar sibiai thak gai or closer report yah kehete hue daakhil kii gai ki use rajesh talwaar par hi shaq he, lekin uske khilaaf koi saboot nahin he
 The Talwar couple then moved the court against this closure report
 court ne bhi report ko riject kar diya or ek naatakeey ghatnakram main talwaar danpati ko phir se saman jari kar diya or sibiai ko dobaaraa maamla chalaane kaa aadesh diya gaya
 In February 2011, a special court in Ghaziabad ordered the trial of Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar to be conducted by a CBI court and issued a non-bailable warrant against the Talwar couple for not being present in the court
 april 2011 main nupur talwaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Finally, in May 2011, the court framed charges against Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar for the murder and destruction of evidence
 sitabanr 2011 main noopur talwaar ko jamaanat mil gai
 In April 2013, a CBI official said in court that Aarushi and Hemraj were murdered by the Talwar couple
 sibiai ne court ko ye bhi bataaya ki aarushi or hemraj aapattijanak avasthaa main mili the
 The defense counsel appealed before the special court on 3 May to summon 14 hawahs to the court
 sibiai ne is apil kaa virodh kiya
 On 6 May 2013, the trial court rejected Talwar's application
 saath main rajesh or noopur ke bayanon ko record karne ke bhi aadesh die
 On May 13, the Supreme Court struck down the Talwar couple, rebuking their application
 kul milakar taarikh badhati gai or aakhirkaar lambey intjaar ke baad aarushi or hemraj ko nyaaya mil hi gaya
 One look at the murder mystery as to what happened - May 16, 2008: Aarushi Talwar was found dead in her Noida home, her neck was cut

 rajesh ko jamaanat di gai
 June 5, 2010: CBI files a petition in the court for narco investigation on Talwar couple
 29 disambar 2010:sibiai ne maamla band karne kii report daakhil kii or kaha ki mukhya sandigdh aarushi ke pita rajesh talwaar hai, lekin unke khilaaf saboot nahin hai
 25 January 2011: Rajesh Talwar is attacked by a young man in the Ghaziabad court premises
 9 farvari 2011:gajiabad kii vishesh adaalat ne sibiai kii closer report khaarij kar di or kaha ki aarushi-hemraj hatya maamle main rajesh or nupur talwaar par maamla chalaaya jaae
 The couple is also accused of erasing evidence after the murder
 gajiabad kii ek sibiai adaalat ne dampatti ke khilaaf adaalat main upasthit nahin hone ke liye jamaanti warrant jari kiya
 March 14, 2012: CBI appeals to the court to dismiss the bail plea of rajesh Talwar
 30 april 2012:aarushi kii maa noopur talwaar ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 3 May 2012: Sessions court dismisses Nupur Talwar's bail plea
 25 may 2012:talwaar dampatti par gajiabad adaalat ne hatya, saboot mitaane or shadyantra rachane kaa aarope lagaaya
 25 September 2012: Nupur Talwar granted bail on the order of the Supreme Court
 april 2013:sibiai adhikari ne adaalat se kaha ki aarushi or hemraj kii hatya rajesh talwaar ne kii
 The CBI said that Aarushi and Hemraj were seen in an objectionable position at the time of the murder
 3 may 2013:bachaav paksh ke vakil ne ek vishesh adaalat main purv sibiai sanyukt nideshak arun kumaar (gavaah ke rup main) sahit 14 logon ko saman bhejne ke liye yachika daakhil kii
 The CBI opposed the petition
 6 may 2013:nichali adaalat ne 14 logon ko saman bhejne kii talwaar kii yachika khaarij kii
 He ordered the recorded statements of Rajesh and Nupur Talwar
 18 oktober 2013:sibiai ne jirah band kii or kaha ki talwaar dampatti ne jaanch ko gumraah kiya he
 12 November 2013: The court reserves its verdict till 25 November
 25 november 2013:sibiai kii adaalat ne rajesh or noopur talwaar ko hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya
 It is unlikely that Aarushi's heart does not beat with the beat of mother
 ansabhav he ki noopur talwaar kii dhadkan beti ke saath naa judi ho
 14 years, the hands which have kneaded their child like wet clay, gave her a form of living, killing her
 adaalat kaa faisla to elaan hone ke saath hi sambandhon ke daayre main ruk sa gaya
 Mummy-father murdered
 aarushi kii hatya ke baad mummy-papa ko lekar saade paanch baras lagaataar jis jakhm ko samoochaa samaaj kuredta rahaa saade paanch baras baad adaalat ne usee jakhm ko beemaari qaraar diya
 So the punishment for the parents started or the punishment ended
 sajaa kaa elaan mangalvaar ko hoga, lekin isse badi sajaa ho kya sakati he, jo faisla adaalat ne diya
 Therefore, in the mirror of the changing society, it is necessary to rediscover relationships
 jis samaaj, jis parivesh or jis jivan ko aarushi ke mummy-papa ji rahi the vah madhyam varg kii chakachaundh kii chahat or khule jivan kii aakanksha samete hue he
 Openness to the metros has become an oxygen to live life and it is from here that the life of raw-sweet Aarushi and mummy-fathers engaged in making her adapt to the same society, same environment
 to kya mummy-papa parampara or aadhuniktaa ke bich ja fanse jahaan khulaapan or chakachaundh apni had main sukun detaa he, lekin beti ko katghare main khadaa jaanata he or khud kisi bhi had tak jane ko taiyaar
 This is the real difficulty and perhaps for the past five and a half years the police, from the CBI to the cross-examination of the mother and father are also in pain and Sukun is also the daughter's killer mummy-father
 yah aisa faisla he, jisane desh kii sabase bady murder mistry ko badalte bharat kii us nai shakl jo jod diya he, jo abhi tak rishton kii door tham kar jindagi jeene kaa mukhauta pahane rahata tha
 Never say that she cares about being called 'honor killing' and sometimes she does not panic about stray capital as the true truth of life
 to is nae bharat main aapkaa swaagat he

 The problem for Team India is that both batsmen, Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay, who have stayed on this wicket for a long time, have understood its mood
 pujaara-vijay ne duusare wicket ke liye 209 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 By this time, it seemed that Team India were chasing England's huge score strongly and the match was moving towards the draw but after Pujara's dismissal, the England players' body language changed and the last two wickets of the day fell
 That team came to the driving seat

 There is every possibility that Team India will save the followon but any score below 450 can make it difficult for him

 There is often news of adulteration in milk, but what will you do if adulteration in milk starts occurring naturally
 chaunkiye nahin ek gilaas doodh ek do nahin bees chemical or dawaaiyon kaa cocktail hota he
 a glass of milk contains antibiotics, painkillers and growth hormone
 vaigyanikon ke nae adhyayan main hairaan karne vaali isi hakeekat kaa pataa chalaa he
 Morning breakfast or dinner
 sehat or tandoorasti kii guarantee he garmagaram doodh kaa ek gilaas
 If you think that you have got a glass of milk, then it is as if a treasure of health has been found, but you will be surprised to know the black truth of white milk which has been revealed in the latest study of scientists
 doodh main sharir ke liye jaruri protein, vitamin or fats hi nahin balki doodh main antibiotic, dardanivarak, hormone or isi tarah kii kai dawaaiyon kaa bhi ghuspaith ho chukaa he jo insaan or jaanwaron kii gambhir bimariyon ke ilaaj main istemaal hota he
 Scientists in Spain and Morocco found in a susceptible investigation that a glass of milk also contains niflumic acid, mefenamic acid, analgesics such as ketoprofen, diclofenac, phenylbutazone, antibiotics like fluorphenicol and hormones such as estrogen, estradiol, ethinyl estradiol
 doodh main naparoksen, flunixin, dycelopheno jaisi taqatvar dardanivarak davaaiyaan bhi mili, jinka istemaal insaan or jaanwaron main haddi kii gambhir bimariyon main hota he
 Anti-malarial drugs like pyrimethamine and anti-fungal drugs like trichlosan have also been infiltrated into milk
 haalanki jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki doodh main in dawaaon kii maatra behad kam he or iskaa asar insaan par nahin hota lekin lambey samay main isak gambhir nateeja bhi ho saktaa he
 Niflumic acid can cause ulcers, respiratory diseases, anemia, then mefenamic acid can cause headaches, diarrhea, gastrointestinal diseases
 kitoprophen se ulcer, kidney kii beemaari, daccelopheno se dil or liver kii beemaari ho sakati he
 Phenylbutazone can cause ulcers, kidney disease, and antibiotics like fluorphenicol can cause diarrhea
 estrogen se ulcer, dil kii beemaari to estradayal se haddi or liver kii beemaari ho sakati he
 Hormones such as ethinyl estradiol can cause heart and skin disease
 naparoksen, flunixin, dycelopheno jaisi dardanivarak dawaaiyon se ulcer or dard kii bimaariyaan ho sakati hai to pyrimethamine jaisi anti malaria drug blad cancer or trychlosan jaisi anti fungal drug se allergy ho sakati he
 The danger is also high because the investigation found the highest amount of these drugs in cow's milk
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki ab insaan ke banaae chemical or davaaiyaan khaane kii har cheez main pahunch gaye hai or isliye inke asar kii jaanch behad jaruri ho gai hai
 The question is, where did the medicines used to treat serious diseases in cow goats milk come from? is sawaal ke jawaab main chupa he wo khatarnaak sachaai jo dharti ke har jeev ke liye khatra ban gai he
 In fact, the chemicals and medicines made by humans have dissolved in the earth's climate like poison, whose dangerous effect is constantly visible
 maamla behad chaunkaane vaala he, lekin yahi hakeekat he
 Chemical and medicines made by humans are slowly being dissolved in the entire climate of the earth like poison and its very dangerous results are coming out

 vahiin bharat or dakshin africa main giddh kii aabaadi main ai kami bhi aabhohawaa main ghulti dawaaon kaa hi nateeja he
 The reason for laying eggs of male fishes is the hormones of the contraceptive pill found in the sea
 vahiin ghodon ke liye bani dardanivarak dawa dycelopheno giddh kii maut kaa kaaran ban raheen kyonki mare hue ghodon ko khaane ke baad giddh bhi bemaut mar rahe
 Actually, it has been found during investigation that medicines and chemicals have reached everything in the food chain of the earth together
 in dawaaon kaa ansh ghar ke siver se hote hue nadi or samudr tak pahunch rahaa
 After reaching the water, these medicines then reach fields and grains and thus form a chain
 yani bimaariyaan dur karne vaali dawaaen hi beemaari or maut baant rahi or ye silsilaa har din tej hota ja rahaa he

 In the politics of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, picketing has always been the biggest weapon
 is baar unhone iskaa istemaal uparajyapal anil baijal ke khilaaf kiya lekin ab alji ke bahaane sidhe pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gherne main jute gaye hai
 Kejriwal's strategy seems to be successful to some extent as he has got the support of several opposition leaders besides four chief ministers on this issue
 vahiin piem par hamalaa tej karte hue kejariwal kii aam aadmi party aaj sidhe unke awaas ko gherne ja rahi he
 It means to say that the Aam Aadmi Party has now made preparations to make this dharna directly started by Modi vs Kejriwal to break the strike of officers in Delhi
 dharne ke liye chunaa LG kaa gharkejariwal kaa dharne se purana naata he, jab bhi kejariwal kii party par siyaasi sankat aayaa, unhone dharne ko hathiyaar banaaya or phir nai takat ke saath ubharkar aam aadmi party saamne ai
 This time Kejriwal changed the politics slightly and chose a place to sit, not Ramlila Maidan or Jantar Mantar, but the office of LG Anil Baijal
 ye dharna jahaan apekshaakrit suvidhajanak he, vahiin asar bhi iskaa zyada dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Kejriwal demands that IAS officers strike LG
 afasar kejariwal se maafee kii maang par ade hai or kai maheene se kaam thap kiye baithe hai
 Kejwal and his fellow ministers, who are sitting outside stirring up AAP leaders, are constantly releasing videos to pressure LG
 soshal media ke jariye bhi is mudde ko dilli kii janata se jodakar bijepi or centre sarkaar cobacefootpar dhakalane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Outside the LG office, AAP workers are continuously protesting
 rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh samet duusare APP netaa har roj press conference kar LG or bijepi par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 This fight is of Kejriwal and his officers but the CM of Delhi has made it himself versus PM Modi
 samarthan main 4 rajyon ke mukhyamantricageriwal kii dharna politics ke bahaane vipaksh kii morchabandi tej ho gai
 The Chief Ministers of the four states have stood in support of Kejriwal citing the authority of the elected government and the constitution
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, karnataka ke mukhyamantri kumaraswami, kerala ke mukhyamantri pi vijayan or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandra babu naidu is mudde ko niti ayog kii baithak main uthaane kaa dam bhar rahe hai
 So that the central government can be pressurized
 isse pehle ye chaaron kejariwal se milane nikal pade the, lekin inhen ijaajat nahin mili
 These four cms have directly held LG and Modi government responsible for the political crisis in Delhi
 chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ke samarthan se AAP khemaa gadgad he or bijepi tamtmaai hui he
 On the seventh day of the siege of PM house, Kejriwal has once again targeted PM Modi by tweeting
 unhone likhaa, 'dilli kaa kaamkaaj thap karwaane vaale piem ke haathon main loktantr kitna surakshit he', aaj shaam 4 baje aap kaaryakarta piem awaas gherenge
 This is part of the strategy that Kejriwal's team has chosen on Sunday to surround the PM residence
 AAP ko lagata he ki ravivaar hone kii vajah se use dilli kii janata kaa bharpoor samarthan milegaa
 Because in every statement AAP leaders do not hold back from saying that they are doing all this for the people of Delhi
 aakhir modi sarkaar kii dilli kii janata se kya dushmani he
 Seeming worried by the growing influence of the Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP today warned that the only alternative to the Congress is the BJP and that no party other than the BJP, no matter how much it is crying out against the Congress, has ever joined hands with the Congress Can
 bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne party kii rashtriya parishad ke adhyakshiya bhaashan main 'aap' kaa naam liye bina kaha, bhaajapa ke alaava kisi bhi anya dal ko diya gaya vot, chaahe vah congress virodh kii kitni hi duhai de rahaa ho, congress ke khilaaf hamase zyada tikhi bhashaa kaa prayog kar rahaa ho, kabhi bhi congress se haath mila saktaa he
 He hit back at Congress President Sonia Gandhi calling the BJP communal, saying that it is the Congress, which does politics of dividing people on religious grounds
 rajnath ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii narendra modi ke bare main kii gai tippaniyon ko lekar un par hamalaa bolaa
 The Prime Minister had said that it would be disastrous if Modi becomes Prime Minister
 is par rajnath ne kaha ki manmohan singh kaa kaarykaal vinaashkari rahaa he, jabaki modi ke netritv main gujarat adarsh rajya bana
 In a two-day meeting of the National Council, which started at Ramlila Maidan here today after the bjp's national executive meeting, Rajnath said that the Congress was feeling extremely dwarfed and weak in the political struggle against the BJP and its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 is
 unke viruddh congress dushprachaar or kanoonee daanv penchon kaa sahaara le rahi he, lekin kanoonee ladaai main bhi congress kii paraajay ho rahi he
 He said that the Congress has been engaged in maligning Modi due to vote bank politics, not for many years from now
 rajnath ne kaha ki gujarat main 2002 main jo kuch hua, vah behad du:khad tha parantu kuch myanon main in dangon ko rokane ke liye tatkaaleen pradesh sarkaar ne jo praytn kiye, uski koi duusari misaal nahin ho sakati
 Despite the effective action taken by the Gujarat government after the riots broke out, the Gujarat government has fully supported the investigation of all the allegations made by the organizations playing in the lap of the Congress till date
 
 Several prominent accused were also punished severely
 modi kii pairvi karte hue unhone kaha ki jis dhang se vigat 11 varshon se congress modi ke peeche padi he, vah sarvatha anuchit he
 If the court acquits in one case, then the government keeps some prapancha ready while on the other hand how many people have been punished by the Congress till date in the 1984 riots? On the contrary, their leaders even put a 'closure report' by the CBI
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne daawa kiya, aaj yug badal rahaa he, aaj congress samet desh ke kuch avasarwaadi dal bhaajapa ko rokane ke liye pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se haath mila rahe hai
 It is natural that the BJP has now been established at the center of India's politics
 ab bharat kii raajnneeti main congress ke yug kaa ant or bhaajapa yug kaa aarambh ho chukaa he
 He cautioned that the country needs a strong government to ease the suffering of the common man and to restore the collapsing constitutional system, but the Congress does not want to, because it feels that like a strong government, like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh Perhaps the future of the Congress will be questioned
 rajnath ne kaha ki aise main bhaajapa ek ‘majboot’ sarkaar chaahati he par congress ‘majaboor’ sarkaar chaahati he taaki 1977, 1989 or 1996 kii bhaanti us sarkaar ko ek do varshon’ main asthir karke satta main vaapasi kii koi jugat baithai ja sake
 He said that the Congress has accepted its defeat in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections but the Congress is a very clever and clever player in politics
 ham sabane dekha ki 10 saal tak congress ne sarkaar main ek mukhute kii oot lekar peeche se sari shakti kaa sanchaalan or desh kaa dohan kiya he
 Now the strategy of the Congress is to somehow prevent the BJP from getting close to the majority in the next election and for this it has campaigned against the BJP by taking some more power
 desh kii arthvyavastha kaa ullekh karte hue rajnath ne kaha ki aaj jahaan vishwa kii badi arthvyavasthaaen punerjeevit ho rahi hai, vahiin bhartiya arthvyavastha ke saamne abhi bhi astitv kaa sankat munh baae khadaa he
 According to him, given the economic data released by the government last week, it worries that month after month when the economic figures are presenting a disappointing picture, at least one "economist Prime Minister" is in Why can't i show the yearning to do something
 unhone kaha ki yadi unki party kii sarkaar kendra main aayi to ‘‘khet ke anusaar kisaanon kii aay’’ sunishchit karne ke liye krishi aay beemaa yojana lagu karegi or har kisaan parivaar ke kam se kam ek vyakti ko vaikalpik rojgaar kaa ek avasar avashya uplabdh karaayenge 
 After the formation of the BJP government, he promised to make legal provisions to ensure the right to health for every poor citizen of the country
 garibi rekha ke neeche rah rahe logon ke liye ek vishesh rojgaar yojana banane kii baat rajnath ne kii
 He accused the UPA government that during its rule the internal and external security of the country had been shattered
 patna main narendra modi kii raily ke dauraan bam visphoton kii ghatana kaa ullekh karte hue unhone kaha ki yah sabit karata he ki na to kendra or na hi bihar sarkaar aatankwaadiyon se mil rahi chunautiyon ko gambhirtha se liya he
 Describing Pakistan as trying to inflict the most wounds on the country in India's history, he said that now the time has come that our dealings with this neighboring country should be in accordance with its actions, not with its promises
 anya padosi desh china ke bare main rajnath ne kaha ki vah bhi bharat ke liye tamaam tarah kii samasyaayein paidaa kar rahaa he
 The BJP president termed Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's attempt to take credit for passing Lokpal Bill as hypocrisy and said that it was a result of Anna Hazare's efforts and BJP leaders pressurized the government and gave full support in getting it passed
 unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar ko lekar congress kaa jo paakhand rahaa he, vah kaaphi haasyaaspad or maryaadaaon ke pratikul he

 Supporting Ranu Mondal, fans are fiercely trolling class of trollers
 ek fain ne apane twitor handle se likhaa, 'mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa ki har koi ranu mandal ke mechap kaa majaak kyon uda rahaa he
 It is not that they have done all this on their own and they know about it
 ' ek duusare fain ne twit karte hue likhaa, 'sabase pehle, aap sabko logon ko trol karnaa kaaphi pasand he
 Cool, it will make a deep impact on their mind and yes Bollywood needs to understand that natural beauty is the best, but don't troll them

 'arbaaz Khan's friend did such a danced dance on' Saki Saki ', the video went viral making everyone remember that one can't change their looks, but you can definitely choose to speak logically & with kindness whilst judging her
 Being in the public eye & under a scanner while she herself is a WIP ain't easy for an adult

 We are living in a time where greatness is live 24 hours worldwide
 har vakt kisi ne kisi ke mahaan hone kaa sidhaa prasaaran ho rahaa he
 Such a phenomenon of becoming or becoming great in real time is not found in any of the ruins of history
 agar aap likes, hashtag or selfi nahin jaanate to tatkaal prabhaav se khud ko digital vanchit ghoshit kar dijie, kyonki yahi sab wo tatpujia item hai jinase koi bhi mahaan ban saktaa he
 Likes sold on digital pavements can reach millions of followers and you can be a leader from Lalbua
 pressure kookar ke vigyaapan kaa model ban sakate hai
 Now, whether or not Nehru was great in such times sixty years ago, it is a dangerous task to weigh, because no one knows how many likes he received at that time
 phir bhi aise khatarnaak kaam karne kaa sabase aasaan madhyam he, tivi or uskaa prime time
 How would the Prime Minister of India like to evaluate Jawaharlal Nehru on 125th birth anniversary
 hashtag or selfi kaal se pehle nehru kii sauveen jayanti par kya is tarah se bahes hui thi
 However, Nehru has returned to social media on his 125th birth anniversary
 nehru share ho rahe hai, unki tasveeron ko likes mil rahe hai, kahin-kahin block bhi ho rahe hai, twitor par nehru phelior bhi trend kar rahaa he
 Some people are being wrapped in a sheet of nostalgia in Nehru's fascination with romance
 nehru kii 125ve jayanti ke khaas hone main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii maujuudagi kaa bhi yogadan gina chahie
 Modi is on a foreign trip, but in the country there is a shadow war between images of Nehru vs Narendra in the background
 agar meri ye baat galat he to waapas lene kaa praavdhaan na hone ke baad bhi ise likhakar mitaayaa hua samaj lijiega
 Whether Modi is weakening Nehru's legacy, capturing it, all these questions are posed by skeptics
 har nayaa pradhanmantri puraani viraasat kaa maalik hota he or nai viraasat kaayam karata he
 For the time being, you can see the highs of Jawaharlal Nehru in these pictures of the black and white period, which we have taken from the site of Nehru Memorial and Museum Library
 aaj nehru hote to unki sherwani silne vaale kalakaar bhi kisi channel ke prime time main nehru ke body language kaa bakhaan kar rahe hote
 If you are not a student of history, then write one thing and keep it in your purse
 duniya bhar main itihaas lekhan kab kaa badal chukaa he
 He has come out of the shadow of the personal qualities of the leaders - demerits and has gone to those streets where history changes after every house
 itihaas kaa matlab biography or murti nahin he
 Yet our politics keeps returning to history with the help of biography and idol of these leaders
 ek nazariyaa he ki ambedkar, nehru, gandhi, patel, bose ye sab alag-alag dalon main bant gaye
 Many people demand that these heroes of history be removed from the leaders' platform and brought back to history, so that they are not evaluated for votes
 lekin aapako isi raajnneeti kaa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki agar ye netaa itihaas ke nayakon tak nahin jate, to ye class room main hi band hokar rah jate
 Due to the current nehru-patel dispute, many people wrote on different aspects of both
 logon tak phir se kai zaruri baaten pahunchi
 Politics uses history, also narrows our view, but the same politics also gives the opportunity to turn the pages of history itself
 dikkat he ki kai log tivi kii bahes dekhakar khud ko itihaaskaar ghoshit kar dete hai
 So, on my side, the big thank you to that declared undeclared politics, which gave an opportunity to talk about Nehru
 patel ke bare main baat karne kaa or jisane kuch saal pehle mauka diya tha, jhalkaari bai se lekar foole, periyar or ambedkar ke bare main baat karne kaa
 So do not unnecessarily kill these politicians and the speakers who have swung at the instigation of them
 wo ek bada kaam kar rahe hai
 So Relax
 itihaas kii alag-alag vyakhyaayein ho sakati hai us par koi kabza nahin kar saktaa
 No one can rewrite history
 haa koi alag itihaas zarur likh saktaa he jo duniya bhar main rose likhaa ja rahaa he
 At most, you may have to go to another booklunch
 to dariye mat
 Evaluate Nehru with an open mind
 mahanatam koi nahin hota, lekin is baat ke liye bhi mat roiye koi patel kii sabase oonchi murti bana rahaa he, balki ye bhi dekhiye ki murti ke peeche ek makasad payrton ko badhaava dena bhi he
 If this idea is successful, then our attitude towards idols will change
 har koi tourism badhaane ke liye apane netaa kii murti banane kii maang karegaa
 It will also demand that the statue of the leader of Kanpur should not be installed in Delhi, because it is causing a loss to Kanpur
 rajagopalaachari, rajendra prasad, nehru or bose kii bhi oonchi murtiyon ban jaaengi
 Nehru's dress and Nayan Naqsh have also done injustice to him
 kai baar lagata he ki unka raajnneetik jivan bahut aasaan rahaa
 He was brought from the cradle to the palanquin itself on the forums of Indian politics
 jabaki unka jivan bhi sangharsh or chunautiyon bharaa rahaa he
 These days Anand Bhawan of Allahabad is illuminated in the memory of Nehru
 is bhawan main shaano shaukat ke aise kisse aaj bhi bhraman karte hai, jaise shabe baraat kii raat aasmaan se utre farishte
 But this building has another history
 raaton raat isane apni vilasita ko utaar phenkaa or aazaadee kii ladaai kaa ek mahatvapurn centre ban gaya
 Jawaharlal Nehru is the turning point of India's freedom struggle, from where the movement begins to go through the pressure of reviving
 ek baichaiyn aatma kii kahani he, jo azaad hindustan ko real time main hasil kar lenaa chahta tha
 He did not have the patience of Gandhi, but he never let his restlessness dominate Gandhi
 us daur main jab hindustan or pakistan ke lakhon log dharm ke naam par ek duusare ke khun ke pyaase ho gaye the, nehru ne faisla kar liya ki vah dharmanirpeksh bharat ke liye sangharsh karenge
 Even in that fierce tide of communalism, Nehru took up the challenge against it and jumped on the question of secular India in India's first election
 dhara ke vipareet chalane kii aisi tamaam khubiyaan hai, to bahut sari kamiyaan bhi hai
 If you cheated by trusting China, the Communist government fell under the label of being communist
 unka naam parivaarwaad kaa ek simbel he
 While its franchise today has so many people ranging from Scindia, Badal, Yadav, Thackeray, Hooda that if you decide on this basis, then the party whose supporters are, will set fire to the same party
 isliye better you ignor parivaarwaad and vaach prime time
 Why do you think that there is a curtain around Nehru, which is due to rise? ham aaj nehru par baaten karenge
 You will know what are the different aspects of watching them
 ajeeb time he
 Warts, maternal uncle, uncle, brother-in-law, brother-in-law and uncle are all uncles, but still one person is still everyone's uncle

 kuch log chanda babu serangadarimang rahe the
 But he refused to give
 vahi log us din unki kiraane kii dukaan par ja pahunche
 His son Satish sat at the shop
 un logon ne satish se rangadari ke do lakh rupee maange
 Satish said to give 30-40 thousand rupees
 rangadari vasuulne aae log zyada the
 They had weapons in their hands
 un logon ne satish ke saath marpet shuru kar di
 Also took out more than two lakhs kept in the flock
 satish kaa bada bhai bhi vahaan aa gaya
 He too was watching everything
 pitane ke baad satish ghar main gaya
 And brought the acid cleaning the bathroom into a mug
 sara tejaab usne rangadari vasuulne aae badmaashon par phenk diya
 The acid splashed on his brother Rajiv
 iske baad vahaan bhagdad much gai
 Two brothers were bathed in the acid shop but miscreants caught Satish
 uskaa bhai rajeev bhagkar kahin chhip gaya
 Then his shop was robbed
 uske baad dukaan main aag laga di gai
 The crooks put Satish in a car and took him along
 duusari dukaan par baithe girish ko is bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 After a while the armed crooks came to him and he was also abducted from there
 iske baad satish or girish kaa bada bhai rajeev bhi un badmaashon ke hathe chadh chukaa tha
 Both their shops were looted for not paying extortion money
 phir teenon bhaiyon ko ek jagah le jaaya gaya
 Where Rajiv was tied with a rope
 uske baad saream satish or girish ke uparatejabase bhari baaltee udel di gai
 Satish and Girish were burned to death in front of the elder brother's eyes
 iske baad un donon kii laash ke tukade tukade karke bore main bharkar phenk die gaye

 vah kisi tarah se ganne se laden ek tractor main chhipakar channpur ja pahunchaa
 From there he reached Padauna in Uttar Pradesh

 Despite this, Chanda Babu mustered courage and reached Siwan
 unhone vahaan police adheekshak se milane kii koshish kii lekin unhen espi se milane nahin diya gaya
 When he reached the police station, the inspector said that you should leave Siwan immediately
 uske baad chanda babu chhapra ke saansad ko lekar patna main ek bade netaa ke paas gaye
 But the leader brushed aside saying that if the matter is of Siwan, he cannot do anything
 is dauraan badmaashon ko chanda babu ke netaa se milane kii khabar lag gai
 He called Chanda Babu's Patna brother and threatened him
 wo dhamkee se itnaa ghabara gaye ki unhone fouran chanda babu kaa saath chhod diya or fouran apana tabadalaa patna se mumbai kara liya

 or unase suraksha dilaane kii guhaar lagaai
 The leader assured help and directed Bihar DGP Narayan Mishra
 dijipi ne aiji ko patr likhaa

 Disappointed Chanda Babu went to Delhi
 vahaan unki mulaakaat rahul gandhi se hui
 But only got assurance

 kya aapane kabhi is baat par gaur kiya he ki majanuun ke matlab kya hai or manchalon ke myne kya? romeo koun tha or roudi kise kehete hai? koi pulisavaala yaa kanoon kaa muhafiz ye kaise pataa lagayegaa ki kisi ladke ne ladki ko chhedaa he? kuya paas se guzar jane bhar ko chhedana mana jayega? yaa sirf nazren milaane bhar ko chhedhkhani qaraar diya jayega? yaa phir ye kaam ladakiyon kii shikaayat par hoga? zaahir he ye tamaam sawaal sun kar ab tak aap samaj hi gaye honge ki yahaan baat kiski ho rahi he
 Romeo was born about five hundred and fifty years ago through a play
 shakespeare ne romeo ko paidaa kiya tha
 The name of the play was romeo-juliet
 donon mohabbat ke aise diwane ki aakhir main ek-duusare ke liye jaan de dete hai or is tarah inaki prem kahani hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye amar ho jaati he
 But after five hundred and fifty years, the same Romeo has suddenly become the most infamous name of UP
 kyonki uskaa naam ishk or mohabbat ke khaane se nikaal kar ab upi ke bigade shohadon ke saath jod diya gaya he
 Romeo has been so infamous rarely before
 majanuun kii bhi aisi haalat pehle nahin hui hogi
 But what to do, when Majnu and Manchal are hanging together on the peg of the law, Romeo and Rowdy will be drawn with the same pole, it will happen
 romeo ke naam se pehle anti lag gaya he or romeo ke naam ke aage dasta
 In this way a new name was added to the Dictionary of Law in UP, 'anti Romeo Squad'
 aisa lagata he maano upi main is vakt manchalon yaa shohadon se badi koi afat hi nahin he
 More than mafia, there is a threat to the city, whether it is a city or a college, as if the police bus has been put on the work of Romeo leaving all work
 jabaki isi upi main bade-bade or chate hue criminal or badmaash inhen khaaki waalon kaa majaak udaate hue lambey vakt se faraar hai or bhagaude bane hue hai
 Before the formation of the government, claims were made to hold such irregularities within a week
 magar shaayad un bhagaude khooni, repist or mafiaon se kahin zyada manchalon se upi ko khatra lag rahaa he, isiilie sari force romeo ke peeche chhod di gai he
 The order of the Yogi government is strict: It was a time that the housemates used to watch the behavior of children
 bachche tahjeeb ghar se sikhte the
 But in this era of social media and internet, children have gone out of the hands of parents
 shaayad isiilie prashasan ko baap kaa role adaa karnaa pad rahaa he
 Yogi ji's order is that now the police teams will keep an eye on the forces
 lekin kya ye mumkin he? ek police vaala kaise ye faisla karegaa ki kisi ladke ne ladki ko chhedaa he? kuya paas se guzar jane bhar ko chhedana kaha jayega? yaa phir ye kaam ladakiyon kii shikaayat par hoga?upi kaa maamla thodaa alagaduniya gavaah he ki koi takat kabhi pyaar karne waalon ko roak nahin pai he, lekin upi kaa maamla thodaa alag he
 It is right to stop girls who molest girls going to school or college 
 lekin ye tay kar paanaa yakeenan ek mushkil kaam he ki koun ladki ko ched rahaa he? koun ladki kii marji se usase mil rahaa he? yaa phir koun kisi kaam se kisi girls skool yaa phir college ke saamne se guzar rahaa he? or bas yahi wo talwaar kii dhar he, jis par in dinon upi police chal rahi he
 Do not expect mercy, along with changing the regime of Manchalesube, as well as the attitude of the police, it is clear that they do not expect the mercy Rahm, because now the road side of the Romans in UP is difficult
 soobe kii rajdhani se lekar har chote bade shahar tak police phul ection main he
 Outside every school, outside every college, there stands an anti-romeo squad, where road lords ruled
 jinhen pataa tha wo to batch gaye lekin jinhen nahin pataa tha wo funs gaye
 The most wanted or famous anti-romeo operation became the victim in Meerut
 anti romeo sqoid banane se manchalon main khalabalidin main skool-college or raat main bazaar jab police kii gasht shuru hui to yahaan-vahaan maujuud manchalon main khalabali much gai
 Seeing the anti Romeo drive in action, people were seen running from the historic buildings and parks of Jhansi
 kuch bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaye to kuch is team ke hathe chadh gaye
 The carnage fell on the people who were camping in the parks
 aise logon kaa police ne puraa kaccha chittha khol daalaa
 anti-romeo squad came in a conspiracy, in front of the bullying of female policemen
 manchalon ko dauda-daudakar peetamahila pulicekarmi khud bheedbhad vaale chauraahon se guzareen or fabtiyaan kasate hi manchalon ko dauda-daudakar peeta
 Every city had the same condition as the head changed
 kanpur main bhi wo ladke-ladkiyaan police ke nishane par rahe jo parkon main baithe hue the
 However, the police did not find prominence here
 vaise ladakiyon se chhedchhad karne vaale manchalon par lagaam kasne kii is koshish main police ne un logon ko bhi nahin choda, jo doston ke saath film dekhne ja rahe the
 In many cases, the police left the girls but took the boy with them to the police station
 IG satish ganesh honge anti romeo sqoid ke leaderanti romeo sqoydkee shuruuaat yun to lakhanu zone main aane vaale shaharon main kii gai, magar jo shahar is zone main nahin bhi aate hai wo bhi manchalon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye sadakon par he
 The head of the anti-romeo squad will be IG Satish Ganesh
 kareeb 500 police adhikari is sqoid kaa hissaa honge
 Action will be taken immediately after identifying sensitive areas
 jila str par aguwai inspector rank kaa pulicekarmi karegaa
 The anti-romeo squad will have mostly female policemen
 team un jagahon kii report degi jahaan aksar chhedhkhani hoti he
 At present, under this operation, the road side Romeo is being punished without any strict action
 magar hidaayat de di gai he ki agar aage se parkon main mohabbat karte dikhe to unke liye bahut mushkil hone vaali he

 Maggie is going to burn more than 40 crores of her packets
 is kaam ko anjaam dene main 2500 trek ke saath kam se kam 40 din kaa samay lagegaa
 Who had thought this would be the fate of Maggie's story starting in 1982
 megi ke bain ne kuch logo kii ankhen kholi to kuch nanheen ankhon main megi koi adhuraa sapana ban kar kanhi kho gayi
 Now how will that Maggie look in 2 minutes? Maggie has left many questions behind her as she leaves her plate? Some that come in my mind are those
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What will happen to those working for Maggi? The livelihood of more than one and a half thousand workers working in 5 Maggi factories in India will be directly affected
 isse aage unki haalat or bhi buree he jo megi ko kuch na kuch supplai karte he
 Moga's Paras Spice Ltd
 of Punjab, which supplies spices to Maggi, has immediately stopped production of the spices offered to Maggi
 jisase takreeban 200 kaamgaar berozegaar ho gaye he
 It is difficult to say that the faces of millions of small and big shopkeepers selling Maggi will be the same
 skool, college main 2 minute main megi banaakar bechney vaale dukandaar ab kya bechenge vahi jaanate honge
 Maggie lovers? India is a new but huge market for packaged food, where people measure the quality of food with its brand
 or phir 2minute main banane vaali megi ke bare main koun nahin jaanata? or ab jab megi ko cement plant main jalaane kii baat ho rahi he to uske chaahane waalon par kya biit rahi hogi vahi jaanate honge
 How much damage did Nestle's brand Maggie have? Maggi's craze in India can be understood by the fact that many people also know noodle by the name of Maggi
 par bharat main lagaataar alag-alag rajyon main bain ke saath hi epasisiai ke bain ke baad megi ne 27,420 ton megi bazaar waapas lene kaa faisla liya he
 This is the biggest setback in the history of the Nestlé, a Swiss company more than 100 years old, when the company has to withdraw one of its products from the market in such a huge quantity
 megi ke aadhikarik sutron kaa kahana he ki brands megi ko bain nahin kiya gaya he, megi ke ek product ko hi bain kiya gaya he baaki megi ke kechap,soup bikate rahenge
 Along with this, the company's recent statement has also promised that people should have full faith in Maggi, for the company the health of its customers is at the top
 khayr megi kii 15 se 16 hajaar kii salanaa bikri karne vaali company kaa nuksaan to ho rahaa he or shaayad isi liye company ke share badhate share bazaar main bhi ludhakte ja rahe he
 On Wednesday alone, its shares fell more than 9 percent
 aapaki sehat ke rakhwale?par sawaal bhartiya khaadya sangraksha evam maanak praadhikaran (FSSAI) par bhi he ki saalo se uskaa thappa lagakar megi bazaar main kaise bikati rahi? wo to uttar pradesh ke barabanki jile ke ek sarkari mulajim ne sari kahani palat di nahin to aaj bhi megi yun hi bazaar main bikati rahati
 Why FSSAI did not know before this that the amount of lead (lead) in Maggi noodles is high and the level of monosodium glutamate (MSG) is also dangerous for health
 FSSAI kaa thappa lagakar bazaar main bik rahe hajaaron utpaadon par log kaise bharosa kar sakenge? bharat ke logon kii sehat ke rakhwar ab tak kis kumbhakarni neend main so rahe the? With this, Rahul Gandhi said, 'PM Narendra Modi cannot run away from the Rafale issue, no one can save him from Rafael
