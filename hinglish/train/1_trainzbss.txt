 aise main chayankarta viraat kohli ke saath tii20 team kii charchaa kar kahin dhoni ko koi sandesh to nahin dena chaah rahe hai? The Modi government on Wednesday raised the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy by Rs 200
 aaj cabinet baithak main sarkaar ne kharif fasal kaa MSP badhaane kaa faisla liya he
 This has opened the way for farmers to get better prices for their crops
 kya hota nunatam samarthan mulya?kisaanon ke hiton kii raksha karne kii khatir nunatam samarthan mulya (MSP) kii vyavastha lagu kii gai he
 Even if the price of crops falls, the government still buys the crop from the farmers at the fixed minimum support price
 iske jariye sarkaar unka nuksaan kam karne kii koshish karti he
 Currently, these products are included
 - anaaj:dhan, gehun, jau, jowar, bajra, makka or raagi- daal:chanaa, arhar / tuur, mung, urad or masoor- tilhan:moongfalee, sarson, toria, soyabean, surajmukhi ke beej, sisam, kusumbhi or khursani, khopra, kaccha kapaas, kaccha jute, ganna, varjeenia flu upachaarit (BFC) tambaaku , nariyal shaamil he
 This is how the government decides: The Government of India announces the minimum support price for some crops before the sowing season on the recommendation of the Agricultural Costs and Prices Commission (CACP)
 isse kisaanon ko yah sunishchit kiya jaataa he ki bazaar main unki fasal kii keemten girane ke baavjood bhi sarkaar unhen tay nunatam samarthan mulya degi
 This is the purpose: The minimum support price system has been introduced so that after the prices of the crop in the market are low, the farmers do not have to forcefully sell their crop at a low price
 nunatam samarthan mulya tab kaam aata he, jab banpar utpaadan samet anya vajahon se bazaar main fasal kii keemat kaaphi gir jaati he
 So on such an occasion the government buys the crop from the farmers at the lowest price
 ye chijen dhyaan main rakhkar tay hoti hai emspi:jab bhi CACP nunatam samarthan mulya kii anushansa karata he, to vah kuch baton ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi ise tay karata he
 For this- what is the cost of the product
 - input mulyon main kitna parivartan aayaa he
 - What is the trend of current prices in the market
 - maang or aapurti kii sthiti kya he
 - International price situation, - In addition CACP decides everything only after taking stock of local, district and national and international status

 Soon after the meeting, Fadnavis said that the mandate is for the bjp-shiv Sena alliance and the two will form the government together
 isse pehle, mangalvaar ko donon pakshon ke bich tikhi or javaabi bayaanbaji chalati rahi
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut accused the BJP of ignoring the agreement, while Devendra Fadnavis rejected the Shiv Sena's claim of 50-50 formula

 During his appearance in court, Jones said that the Quran promotes terrorist activities all over the world

 Catch equality in demonetisation and reservation in poor in government jobs and educational institutions, you have to fall on the government
 notebandi main sarkaar ko yah pataa nahin tha ki use is aarthik bukamp se hasil kya karnaa he
 Before demonetisation, the government did not have black money figures in the country, and after the new reservation, the poor of the country do not know how and what they will get from it because the government has planned to measure poverty or earning or identifying the poor
 Postponed garibi kii paimaaish kaa taaja kissa behad dilachasp haihua yah ki march, 2015 main sarkaar ne niti ayog ke tatkaaleen upaadhyaksh arvind pangadipha kii aguai main 14 sadasyeey dal banaaya jise 31 agast, 2015 tak garibi kii nai paribhaasha tay kerani thi or garibi kam karne kii ranneeti banani thi
 After the extension of the tenure, its report reached the Prime Minister in June 2017, till then the government had no intention of giving reservation to the poor and the poverty or income measure of the people was considered unnecessary
 is rapat kaa aadhaar bane ek adhyayan (yah panktiyaan likhe jane tak niti ayog kii website par uplabdh) ke mutabik
 
 
 In 2009, the Suresh Tendulkar Committee revamped the poverty measurement formula (consumption expenditure vs
 earnings), under which a rural household of five earns Rs 4,080 per month and cities below Rs 5,000 are below the poverty line 
 rangarajan samiti ne ise sanshodhit kiya tha lekin usase garibi or zyada badi hui najar aane lagi
 Therefore, according to Niti Aayog, Suresh Tendulkar's calculation is the official poverty line
 haalanki isamen kai khamiyaan hai
 The Modi government started using the 2011 Socio Economic Survey to identify the beneficiaries of government schemes (ujjwala, electricity, toilets)
 haalanki yah survey keval gramin aabaadi ke liye he or isamen pariwaron kii puri aay yaa kharch kii gananaa nahin kii jaati
 The NITI Aayog also explored the option that instead of fixing the poverty line, poverty reduction should be measured by monitoring the improvement in the lives of the poorest 30% of the country's population, as the World Bank recently did
 
 
 antat yah kehete hue ki garibi kii rekha tay karne kaa makasad garibi main kami ko naapnaa he na ki garibon kii pahchaan ke liye kisi formule kii jarurat nahin he
 
 
 The NITI Aayog (the documents) gave up on the attempt to identify the poor and the effect of government schemes was blamed
 aarthik aarakshan se pehle suurate haal yah hagareebi kii koi ek paimaaish yaa pahchaan nahin he
 The government wants to deliberately keep it under illusion
 tendulkar kaa formula (bipiel ko rashan) or 2011 ke saamaajik aarthik surveykshan (anya scimen) donon hi aajamaaye ja rahe hai
 3 lakh under the Housing Schemes of the Governments
 kii seemaa waalon ko kamjor aarthik varg or 3 se 6 lakh waalon ko nimna aay varg maanane kaa paimaana bhi chal rahaa he
 Meanwhile 8 lakh in economic reservation was Rs
 tak kii salanaa kamai vaale log shaamil honge jabaki unheen ke parivaar main paanch lakh ru
 People earning annually will be paying income tax
 yani ki raja jise maane vahi garib
 Therefore, at this time there are two types of poor in the country — one who is truly poor, the other — those who will be identified as poor in the light of politics, otherwise they are born of birth, provided they want to do something
 jab ve kuch karnaa nahin chaahatin to unke hajaar haath sach chhipaane, bharamaane or bargalane main lag jate hai
 Figures are the surest mantar of this black magic
 sankhyaayein garh kar bharamaaya ja saktaa he
 Data can be hidden in true darkness or memorials can be made of facts, logic and transparency, eliminating the need for data
 haalanki solah loksabhaayen bana chuke bharat ke log bhi ab shaayad yah samajhane lage hai: ve sarkaar se jhooth bolte hai to vah aparaadh he par sarkaar logon se jhooth bole to

 jahaan varisht party netaaon yashavanth sinha or shanta kumaar ne party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke istife kii unki maang kaa samarthan kiya, vahiin gadakari ko likhi 27 november kii apni kadi chitthee main shatrughna sinha ne nae sibiai pramukh ranjit sinha kii niyukti ke anumodan main jethmalani kaa paksh liya
 In a letter written to Gadkari, Jethmalani made fun of him: "I am sure that you are firmly on your way to suicide and have determined to drag the entire party with you
" vinaashkale vipareet buddhi ek puraani kahawat he
 Jethmalani did not hesitate to try Jaitley even to protest the appointment of CBI chief Ranjit Sinha and accused Jaitley of being part of the conspiracy to defame Sinha
 unhone kaha ki teen naamon vaale sibiai nideshak pad ke antim panel main se apane naam ko nikaale jane ke sarkaar ke faisle ko kendriya prashasnic panchat (cat) main chunauti dene vaale dilli police ayukta niraj kumaar kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale vakil vastutah jetali ke hi junior the
 Jethmalani wrote to Gadkari, "it is absolutely impossible that he is not aware of the ongoing litigation in CAT, and i guess you too have acted on Jaitley's advice
" ” haalanki jetali ne 27 november ko media se kaha ki yah aarope kisi pratikriya ke laayak nahin hai
 Both Jaitley and Swaraj opposed Sinha's appointment
 unhone sarkaar se kaha tha ki vah sansad main lokapal bill paarit hone tak niyukti ko roke rakhe
 Jethmalani praised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for this election and fair selection process
 lokapal bill main sibiai pramukh kaa chayan ek colegium se karne kaa prastaav he
 Jethmalani is also angry at not being consulted on the Lokpal bill
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main rajyasabha kaa ek varisht sadsy or bijepi ke sansthaapakon main se hum par loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha ke aapke kisi vartmaan netaa ne lokapal bill ke bare main mujhase kabhi koi charchaa tak nahin kii
 Sources close to Jethmalani say that Swaraj was actually crushed with wheat like a mite, otherwise Jaitley was the real target of the attack
 donon kii dushmani kii jaden 2000 main us vakt panpin jab atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main jetali ne vidhi mantri ke rup main jethmalani kii jagah lee thi
 At the time Jethmalani as Law Minister, the then Chief Justice A
 es
 Anand and Attorney General Soli were engaged in a fight with Sorabji
 jetali or jethmalani ke bich patron ke aadan-pradaan ke saath maamla kuch zyada hi ulajh gaya tha
 In such a situation, Vajpayee asked Jethmalani to resign
 us samay ke vaanijya rajya mantri jetali ko vidhi mantralay atirikt prabhaar ke rup main diya gaya or jald hi unki tarakkee kar unhen cabinet mantri kaa ohada de diya gaya
 "jethmalani always felt that Jaitley was the one to incite Vajpayee to remove him from the cabinet," says a senior BJP leader
 vaise bhi vaajapeyi jethmalani ke saath kuch asahaj mahasoos kiya karte the
 He was inducted into the cabinet at the behest of then Home Minister LK Advani
 jethmalani ramajnmabhumi maamle main adwani ke vakil the
 But Jethmalani opposed Advani's anti-terrorism TADA bill and also angered him
 ” jethmalani 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vaajapeyi ke khilaaf lakhanu se chunaav lade or parajeet hue
 This rift between Jaitley and Jethmalani continued after Jaitley acquired the most important post in terms of legal matters within the party
 phir jab jethmalani ne rajyasabha kii ek seat ke saath bijepi main vaapasi kii koshishen kin to jetali ne iskaa virodh kiya
 In the hope of helping Jethmalani in his legal matters, Modi strongly supported him
 modi ke kareebi amit shah us samay jail main hi the
 a BJP leader known for his proximity to Modi further says, "jaitley calls Modi to protest Jethmalani's candidature because of good relations
" modi naaraaz ho gaye or unhone jetali se poocha ki kya ve unhen jail main dekhnaa chaahate hai?” mana jaataa he ki amit shah kaa mukadmaa ladgaye or modi ko kanoonee madad dene kii evaj main hi jethmalani ne gujarat se rajyasabha seat hasil kii
 Despite being part of the party's core group with RSS thinkers s Gurumurthy and Arun Shourie, Jethmalani was never able to establish a strong base for himself in the party
 aresas ke saath unke rishte immergency ke dinon se hai
 They are always considered worthy of sacrifice in the absence of mass base
 ek bijepi sadsy kaa kahana he, ‘‘gadakari khud bhi jethmalani jitne hi swatantra mizaaj vaale netaa hai
 He was unable to take any action against this senior advocate on his own
 party kaa sansadeey board hi unhen nishkasit karne kaa koi nirnay le saktaa he
 The kind of secrets they know about senior party leaders can single-handedly sink the party
 na keval unki yaaddaasht jabardast he, balki bijepi netaaon ke bare main ve ek visphotak file bhi rakhe hue hai
 "the confidence of this legal consummate can be understood by his statement on 25 November," No one has the courage to take action against me
 ” ise sweekaar karte hue bijepi ne unhen party kii sadsyta se nilambit kar diya lekin unhen nishkasit nahin kar pai
 a show cause notice was issued to Jethmalani
 unhone apane chir-parichit ‘bhaad main jaao’ vaale andaaj main jawaab dete hue kaha ki kaaran bataao notice main koi merit nahin he or vah ‘koodaydaan main phenkane laayak he
 'jethmalani is nonchalant because he has nothing to lose
 yahi vah vajah bhi he jiske chalate bijepi main log unase khauf khate hai
 He is not only a talented lawyer, but also a stubborn opponent, armed with vicious legal brains, wits and skillful speech skills

 In such a big question is arising that is our banking system phoolpruf regarding demonetisation? When asked about similar questions, Rajiv Rishi, Chairman of Central Bank of India, said that this is the subject of investigation

 ji haa, yah kissa he uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu kaa jahaan par modi sarkaar ke ek cabinet mantri ke PS ke liye padmavat express menacy first class kaa atirikt kochalgaya gaya
 When the matter came to light, Railway Board Chairman Ashwani Lohani has ordered an inquiry into the incident
 railway ke sutron ke mutabik, 21 oktober ko lakhanu pahunch rahi padmavat express ko outer par hi roak kar aanan-fanan main atirikt coach kaa intjaam kiya gaya
 Not only this, the platform of the train was also changed in the whole process and the train was delayed for almost an hour between them

 For this the Padmavat Express was stopped and all the rules for sending PS to Delhi were put on hold
 railway ne PS parivaar samet rajdhani dilli ko bhejne ke liye padmavat express main asi first kii compojit vaali atirikt bogi lagava di
 Not only this, a railway officer was stationed at the station to receive this PS
 atirikt coach lagane ke chakkar main train kaa plateform bhi badal diya gaya jisaki vajah se yah train takreeban 1 ghanta let ho gai
 The special thing is that the Railway Board has made rules that the platform of any train will not be changed at the last moment because it is expected to cause a stampede but bypassing all these rules, the Union Minister's PS took full care of it
 Gone
 vinay shrivastav maikenical sarvice ke afasar hai

 On this, at about 8 o'clock at night, railway officials from Delhi to Lucknow were issued an order to arrange additional coaches for PS in train number 14207 Padmavat Express
 padmavat express kaa chart shaam ko 5:40 par hi final ho chukaa tha or chart banane ke baad bhi darjanon yatri vatting main rah gaye the
 On the other hand, after receiving the order only 55 minutes before the arrival of the train, one AC second and AC third bogey was given fitness on the immediate papers for the family of PS
 lakhanu main train raat 9:50 par aane vaali thi lekin atirikt dibba lagane ke liye train kaa platform badalakar do se platform number 6 par kar diya gaya
 Due to this, the train was standing on the outer very long
 is bich atirikt dibbe ke aane ke baad train ko stesan par laayaa gaya
 The extra compartment was placed behind the train and after all this incident the train left at 10:35 pm
 is tarah se padmavat express apane tay samay se takreeban 1 ghante deree se ravaanaa hui
 Meanwhile, Union Minister PS Vinay Srivastava, while giving a clarification in a conversation with 'aaj Tak', said that he had not spoken to anyone to get a box in a separate train
 unka kahana tha ki railway main unki sthiti ko isi baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki unka lakhanu mail dupliket kaa tikat bhi immergency cote main conform nahin hua
 According to Vinay Srivastava, when his ticket was not confirmed, he reached Charbagh railway station
 vahaan par railway adhikariyon ne kaha ki vah kisi duusari train main dekh lete hai
 Due to festive crowds, two additional coaches were installed in the Padmavat Express in which they also got space
 unke mutabik, unhone railway ke paas par travel kiya he or unhone railway board ke kisi bhi shaks se iske liye sifarish nahin lagavai
 On the other hand, according to the sources of the railway, orders have been made to investigate the incident, but the top officials are saying that there was no box for PS, but there was a high number of passengers in the waiting, due to which the extra coach was installed

 The internal battle of the Aam Aadmi Party came to the fore in the National Council meeting on Thursday
 kumaar vishwaas ke samarthakon ne vidhayak amanatulla kii gaadi roki, to amaanat ke samarthakon ne bhi kumaar vishwaas kii gaadi roki
 There was fierce sloganeering between the two

 Kumar Vishwas looked very angry AAP leader Kumar Vishwas looked very angry with this uproar
 unhone twit kar ishaaron hi ishaaron main aam aadmi party ke sheersh netritv par nishaanaa saadhaa
 What will happen if the painless looterogam speaks of happiness, what will we say if we are afraid of silence
 
 ?? 🤔— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas) November 2, 2017 After the uproar, he said, 'I did not go to Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan for this day
 yah party meri he
 Those who have been working for another party for 20-25 years, they will leave the party
 pehle mujhe pataa tha ki bijepi or congress ko mere bolne se dar lagata he, par lagata he kuch or logon ko mere bolne se dar lagata he
 The party has asked me not to speak, so i am not speaking today
 main to pehle hi kahata tha ki vah (amanatulla) keval mukhauta he
 'kumar Vishwas' name was missing from the agenda prepared for the National Council meeting on 2 November
 party kaaryakartaaon kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak main kumaar kaa naam vaktaaon kii suchi tak main shaamil nahin tha
 When many activists raised questions about this, Sisodia invited him to address, but Kumar Vishwas refused to address at the moment
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud agenda ke mutabik, subah 9 baje se shaam 5 baje tak chalane vaali baithak main kai ahm muddon par charchaa honi thi, lekin party kii taraf se bheje gaye agenda main kumaar puri tarah sidline kar die gaye
 Kumar Vishwas, who has expressed his displeasure over the cancellation of Amanatullah Khan Kanilamban, has received a major setback from the party
 jab rashtriya parishad kii baithak main kumaar vishwaas ne pravesh kiya to to kai kaaryakartaaon ne is par sawaal uthaaya ki vaktaaon kii suchi main kumaar vishwaas kaa naam kyon nahin he
 Many activists from all over the country started speaking in support of it
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan kar rahe dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha ki nishchit rup se ve apana sambodhan kar sakate hai or unhone kumaar ko manch par bolne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 But Kumar Vishwas declined the invitation and said that if he is not named at present, it does not matter, he will address the workers later if needed
 saal main kam se kam ek baar hone vaali is baithak kaa aayojan bahari dilli ke alipur main kiya gaya he
 The National Council of AAP has about 300 members, while about 150 members have been called by special invitation to this meeting
 isse pehle rashtriya parishad kii baithak kaaphi hangaamedaar rahi he
 The expulsion of Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav is one of the same uproar
 is baar bhi agenda main kumaar vishwaas kaa naam shaamil nahin hone se kaaryaktaaon main kaaphi halchal he
 At present, there may be confusion between the activists due to the ongoing cold war between Arvind Kejriwal team and Kumar Vishwas team
 saath hi sawaal yah bhi uthta he ki 6 maheene pehle kumaar ke samarthan main khadey rahane vaale vidhayak kya ab bhi apane faisle par kaayam rahenge

 (in this case, 29 other accused were acquitted) saal 2016 kii 8 novemberki shaam ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh kii janata ko sambodhit kiya
 In his address, he said, "to curb corruption and black money, we have decided to discontinue 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 ye note madhyaratri se (8 november,2016) legal tender nahin rahenge
 This announcement of PM Modi surprised everyone
 8 november, 2017 ko notebandi ko ek saal puraa hone ko he
 Meanwhile, demonetisation has made a deep impact on India
 aage jaaniye ki notebandi ne bharat ko kitna badla he or iskaa bhartiya arthvyavastha par kya asar rahaa
 That is why the Modi government has given many reasons to bring the note ban
 isamen kaledhan kaa khaatmaa karnaa, cirkulation main maujuud nakli noton ko khatm karnaa, aatankwaad or naksal gatividhiyon par lagaam kasne samet cashles iconomi ko badhaava dene jaise kai vajahen ginai gai hai
 Returned so much money after demonetisation 48 lakh bank khaaton main 1
 Rs 48 lakh crore was deposited
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne sansad main isaki jaankaree di thi
 He told that at least 80 lakh rupees were deposited in each of these accounts
 1
 Average deposit 3 in 48 lakh bank accounts
 3 karod rupee rahi
 Talking about two-thirds closed notes returned small deposits, from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 80 lakh have been included in it
 lagbhag 1
 The amount was deposited in 09 crore bank accounts in this scope
 in khaaton main ausat diposit 5 lakh rupee kii thi
 According to an estimate, two-thirds of the currency notes after demonetisation have returned to the banking system
 agast main bhartiya rigerv bank ne bataaya ki 15
 Closed notes with a value of Rs 3 lakh crore have been returned to the banking system
 iskaa matlab 99 fisadi band note 30 june tak banking system main laute
 Some critics say that when all the money is returned to the banks, then the government has not been able to catch black money
 sara paisa bank main waapas lautne kaa matlab he ki sarkaar ko kalaadhan pakadaney main kisi bhi tarah kii safalataa haath nahin lagi he
 Fight against black money The government claims that demonetisation has hit hard on black money
 himachal pradeshan main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne bataaya ki notebandi ke baad band hui 3 lakh companiyon main se 5 hajaar companiyon ke bank khaaton se 4000 karod rupee hone kaa pataa chalaa he
 The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has presented some figures based on preliminary investigations
 mantralay ke mutabik 56 bainkon se mili data ke anusaar 35000 companiyon ke 58000 bank khaaton main notebandi ke baad 17 hajaar karod diposit hue or nikaale gaye
 During this time, the government has also talked about locating many shell companies
 bhalla kaa daawa, notebandi kaledhan ko pakadaney main safalaiconomist or aarthik maamalon kii samiti ke sadsy surajeet bhalla kaa anumaan he ki notebandi ke baad lagbhag sara kalaadhan pakad main aayaa he
 This makes the government 2 in the first year
 5 lakh karod rupee kaa rajasav hoga
 After this for a few years to come, the Center was due to this 5 lakh karod rupee kii atirikt kamai hogi
 What was the effect on fake notes? So far the current record shows that demonetisation has not been successful on this front
 is saal ai ek report ke mutabik 1000 rupee ke jitne band note waapas bainkon main laute hai, usamen sirf 0
 Only 0007 per cent were fake notes
 band 500 rupee kii note kii baat karen, to isamen bhi sirf 0
 002 percent were fake notes
 vahiin, rashtriya jaanch agency ke mutabik 2015 tak 400 karod rupee ke nakli note cirkulation main the
 Critics say demonetisation has failed to capture fake notes on a large scale
 digitalykaran or notebandinotbandi ke baad digital pement main badhottaree hui he
 According to the Payments Council of India, the speed of cashless transactions has increased by 40 to 70 percent after demonetisation
 pehle yah raftaar 20 se 50 fisadi par thi
 Even though cashless transactions increased after demonetisation, but after few months it started to decrease and people came back to cash
 lekin ghatane lage hai cashles tranjactionpichley saal november maheene main 67
 There were 149 crore digital transactions
 disambar maheene main yah badhkar 95
 750 crores
 haalanki is saal july tak yah aankada ghatakar 86
 238 crores
 records ke mutabik artijies or enift transfar 2016-17 main kramash: 6 fisadi or 20 fisadi bade hai
 Impact on growth rate: GDP growth rate in the first quarter after the announcement of ban
 1 fisadi par aa gai
 This 7 during this past year
 9 fisadi par thi
 After this, the growth rate was further reduced in the april-june quarter and it was 5
 7 fisadi par pahunch gai
 This 7 during this past year
 1 fisadi par thi
 However, the situation is not clear about whether demonetisation is the reason behind the decrease in growth rate
 iske liye jiesti ko kuch had tak jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 While enforcing Maranotbandi on Naxalism and terrorism, it was also stated that this would curb terrorism and Naxalite activities
 lekin ek saal baad bhi aisa koi pukhta data nahin he, jo ye bataa sake ki in gatividhiyon par kitni roak notebandi kii vajah se lagi hui he
 There has been an increase in terrorist activities in Kashmir
 haalanki naksali gatividhiyon main kami dekhne ko jarur mil rahi he
 From the wait of 6 months, some economists are positive about the ban on banning, many believe that it has caused damage to the economy
 antarrashtriya sansthaaon ne bhi kaha he ki notebandi kii vajah se laghu avadhi main iconomi ko nuksaan jarur pahunchaa he, lekin lambii avadhi main iskaa phayda najar aayega
 Surjit Bhalla says that to see the impact of demonetisation, wait for 6 more months
 is dauraan data aa jayega or pataa chal jayega ki notebandi paas hui yaa fail

 The Shiv Sena, an ally in the central and NDA governments of Maharashtra, has once again attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party
 is baar shivasena ne oxfam kii report ko lekar modi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 The Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamana said that Hindustan would soon become an economic giant
 is tarah kii afvaahen pehle bhi bich-bich main udayi jaati rahi hai
 Regardless of the party of the central government, how the graph of the country is growing rapidly in the economic field, it has become a tradition to say the arms
 shivasena ne saamana ke sampadakeey main kaha ki is tathakthith aarthik unnati kaa koi bhi fal aam aadmi kii jholii main nahin girtaa he
 Because of this, the people of the country do not even trust mole on those who do such firecrackers
 aarthik vikaas or desh ke sarvangin unnati kaa dhol sattadhari kitna hi kyon na piten par sachai iske vipareet he
 Shiv Sena bid- Oxfam report restless Shiv Sena said that the annual report of 'oxfam', a reputed organization working in the economic sector, has exposed the claim of 'sabka Vikas'
 hindustan ke amir or garib ke bich kii duuri teji se bad rahi he, yah sachai duniya ke saamne is report ne rakh di he
 This report is disturbing to every sensitive person
 duniya ke saath-saath hindustan kii asli tasviir bataane vaali is report ne amir or garib ke bich kii sachai ko saamne laakar rakh diya he
 The report also stated that 51 of the total assets of Hindustan
 53 pratishat hissaa sirf ek pratishat logon ke paas he
 Saamana's editorial said that 10 percent of the country's people own 77 of India's total assets
 4 pratishat hissaa he
 More than half of the country's wealth is in the vault of just one percent of the rich people of the country
 yah vishmata yaheen par nahin thamati
 Which is one percent rich class, their wealth has increased by Rs 2 thousand 200 crore per day in the last one year, due to which these 'kuberas' of India became 39 percent more wealthy in a year
 iske vipareet aarthik drushti se kamjor hone vaali janata kii sampatti main sirf 3 pratishat kii vruddhi hui he
 On the one hand, the rich, on the other, those poor who have no two-time luck, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ally Shiv Sena said that the Oxfam report showed that one percent are rich on the one hand, on the other hand, those who have two-time morsels Even luck is not there
 gaanv, bastiyon or shahari jhoparpattiyon main jivan vyateet karne vaali garib janata ko roti ke liye to sangharsh karnaa hi padataa he
 They also have to struggle hard for the disease and the medicines needed for it
 ek pratishat logon ke paas aseemit sampatti he or usee desh main baaki janata ke paas anaaj ke liye bhi paise nahin hai
 Despite this gap of inequality, the boast of having the largest democracy in the country is boasted
 ‘oxfam international’ ne isi vishmata par ungali uthaai he
 The rulers have changed the meaning of democracy: Shiv Senashivasena said that the fierce disparity of one percent rich and poor on the other is going to undermine the social structure of India and the foundation of democracy
 is tarah kii chetavanee hi oxfam ne di he
 In the book, the definition of democracy is written in it, 'public welfare state run by the people, is called democracy
 ' loktantr kii yah paribhaasha kaagaj par hi rah gai
 The rulers have distorted this definition - 'a rule run by a handful of people, a democracy for a handful'
 kisaan aatmahatya kii jad vishamtaduniyabar kii arthvyavastha kaa adhyayan kar garib or amir kii vishmata par ‘oxfam’ har saal apni report pesh karti he
 Similar inequality has also come before this
 magar is vishmata ko kam karne kii drushti se garibon ko aarthik rup se adhik sakasham karne ke liye kisi tarah kii koi thos yojana dikhaai nahin detii he
 That is why this gap of inequality is increasing day by day instead of decreasing
 shivasena ne kaha ki hindustan ke kisaan, berozegaar or nimna va madhyam vargeeyon kii aatmahatya kii jad isi vishmata main chhipi he
 The declaration of a good day flew like a dry leaf
one percent of the wealthy people have more than half the wealth of the country and the abject poverty in the homes of the poor of the rest of the country shows the terrible truth of India's inequality 'oxfam'
 hindustan kii samast janata ko chahie ki is report ko dekhakar sattadhariyon se yah sawaal puche ki aakhir itani vishmata kyon he? ‘achche din’ or ‘sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas’ jaisi ghoshnaa is tarah kii report ke saamne sookhe pattey kii tarah ud jaati hai or satta sirf ek pratishat amiron ke liye hi chalaai ja rahi he kya? yah jo sawaal khadaa hota he, wo alag se he?

 The news is also that Sharad Pawar will meet Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on 17 November
 tabhi kuch bhi aakiri nirnay liya ja sakegaa
 However, in the midst of all this manipulation, the Congress is taking a very rude step
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on being asked 'if Shiv Sena CM will be for 5 years or CM will be for 2
 5 years each from NCP and Shiv Sena? ': Hum toh chahte hain aane wale 25 saal tak Shiv Sena ka CM rahe, aap 5 saal ki baat kyun karte ho

 " The assembly by-election to be held on October 21 in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh is a do or die election for the ruling Congress
 bhaajapa ke ji
 s
 damor ne ratlam se loksabhaa kaa sadsy banane ke baad yahaan ke vidhayak pad se istipha de diya, jisase yah seat khaali hui
 The Congress is putting full emphasis in this election
 usne apane diggaj netaa kantilal bhuriya ko bhaajapa ummidavaar or bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke jila adhyaksh bhaanu bhuriya ke khilaaf maidan main utaara he
 Kantilal Bhuria lost the Lok Sabha elections against Rator from Ratlam
 congress ko puraa ehsaas he ki jhabua main jeet behad jaruri he
 It has 114 mlas in the 230-member assembly and the government rests on the support of four independents, two BSP and one SP MLA
 jhabua main jeet se congress kii sankhya 115 ho jaaegi or ek nirdaleey vidhayak pradeep jaiswal mantri hai, isliye party ko 116 vidhayakon kaa samarthan mil jayega
 This would give him a simple majority
 lekin viraasat ke pachade, andruni kalah or jhabua main pichhali haar ke kaaran is baar bhi jeet itani aasaan nahin he
 However, Jhabua has a significant number of tribal voters and was once considered a Congress stronghold
 mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kalah par sabase pehle dhyaan diya
 At its root is a rivalry between former MLA Javier Maeda and Kantilal Bhuria
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main meda jhabua seat se laduya chaah rahe the par tikat kantilal bhuriya ke bete vikrant bhuriya ko mila
 In that election, Vikrant lost to Damore by 10,000 votes while the independent contested Meda got around 35,000 votes
 is baar upachunaav main bhi meda ne ummidavaar banane kii maang kii thi par ab ve kantilal ke paksh main chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai
 This shows that the party leadership has made a strong intervention
 kantilal ke prachaar main unki bhatiji kalavati bhuriya bhi jor laga rahi hai, jo paas kii jobat seat se vidhayak hai
 BJP candidate Bhanu Bhuria also belongs to a former Congress family
 unke pita congress ke vidhayak rahe hai
 Bhanu also has the support of the youth of the area
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki unki lokapriyata or loksabhaa chunaav main mili shandaar nateezon kaa is chunaav main laabh milegaa
 With this victory, the BJP will remain the same as before, but this will give excitement to those in the party, who believe that the state government can be brought down and regained power by defecting

 Therefore, there is a conspiracy all around to strangle his throat, or to cast dust on him, or to stand him alive
 kintu ve apni safalataa par na daalen
 Truth is Bahupriya
 satya ko zindaa agar ve gaad denge,pach na dharti se sakegaa,fasal banakar ugega,jo ann khaayegabanegaa krantikari
 The truth will fall on the dust, it will be torn and stripped naked
 rasmi laaj ko dhakka lagaayegaa,sabhi kaa dhyaan aakarshith karegaa
 If he will strangle him, he will splash in some poet-gorge, come out and become a song and stir the heart

 Yes, in the truth lies - the right to join the imagination, we are only poets by tradition, because we present the truth by making Shivam and Sundaram! *** There was a time when injustice was the fear of tyranny that people would rise up against it, raise their hands, Arms will rise

 And today, people slaughter lakhs-ha-lakhs-nibbles, and the news of rape on abalas - dissolving in morning tea every day - drank in two or four puffs of cigarettes and sitting on the curb! *** The thing that has passed, it has passed! There was a star in life, admittedly, it was very cute, how many its stars were broken, how many of its lovely touches, which were left and where they were found, but say broken stars

 Sushil Modi has clearly stated in an interview to a newspaper that no leader should impose his decision on the party
 susheel ne sanjay joshi prakaran ko lekar kaha ki jis tarah sanjay joshi ko hataaya gaya, vah thik nahin tha, kyonki kisi ko bhi party ko 'hijank' nahin karnaa chahie or na hi party par apana faisla thopanaa chahie

 unhone kaha ki sangh parivaar main ise lekar naaraazgi he, lekin main nahin maanata ki log bijepi se niraash hai
 He said that some decisions of BJP chief Nitin Gadkari were questioned, as he was not experienced in such work, but later he handled the work well, but he should not bow down to pressure from any one person
 bihar ke upmukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri pad ke liye ummidavaar endie kaa hi hoga, isliye hamen apane sabhi sahyogiyon kii bhaawanaaon kaa dhyaan rakhana hoga

 maovadiyon kii sashastr sangharsh ke madhyam se bhartiya loktantr ko ukhaad phenkane kii yojana he or 2050 tak vah sarkaar par niyantran karnaa chaahate hai
 Union Home Secretary Gopal Krishna Pillai said this on Friday
 ‘left wing extrimism in india’ par ek seminar ko sambodhit karte hue pillai ne kaha ki vidhvansak gatividhiyaan chalaane ke liye maovadiyon ko kuch purv sainikon kaa sahyog bhi milane kii ashanka he
 He said, 'he does not want to overthrow the Indian Republic tomorrow or the day after
 ek pustika ke anusaar unki ranneeti 2050 kii he jabaki kuch dastavejon ke anusaar yah 2060 he
 According to Pillai, Naxalites are not running their target in 2012 or 2013
 yah lambii dhimi yojana he or pichley 10 varshon main unhone dhire-dhire apni gatividhiyon ko anjaam diya he
 He said, 'now he can harm many sectors of the Indian economy

 He said, 'he is very committed, highly trained
 mujhe vishwaas he ki kuch purv sainik yaa kuch log unke saath hai
 Giving reasons for this, Pillai said that the Naxalites analyze the entire campaign before starting any attack
 unhone kaha, ‘prayek hamale ke baad vah iskaa vishleshan karte hai
 The analysis is of the level of the armed forces of a country
 ’grih sachiv ne kaha ki pichley varsh naksali hinsa main 908 logon kii jaan gai jo 1971 ke baad sabase zyada he or yah is varsh zyada to agle varsh kam ho saktaa he
 According to Pillai, even though the joint anti-naxal operation is continuing, the Naxalites have not yet suffered a major setback and it may take seven to eight years for the government to control the areas which have been occupied by the Maoists
 unhone kaha, ‘abhiyaan main kattar maovadiyon ke paanch fisadi ko bhi nishaanaa nahin banaaya gaya he
 The actual armed cadres have not yet come forward

 police kii kahani or tamaam daavon par sawaal uthne shuru ho gaye hai-1

 jaat par na paat par, batan dabaao haath par kaa naaraa dene vaali congress upi main 27 saal baad satta main vaapasi ke liye jati or dharm kaa har card khelti ja rahi he

 darasal, congress ko lagata he ki obisi main yadavon kaa bada varg ko sapa ke saath rahegaa, isliye usne obisi main yadavon ke alaava baaki jatiyon par dore daalane kaa faisla kar liya
 Under the strategy, Gandhi first met the MBC leaders coming to the obcs in Delhi, listening to their demands, only after which it was decided that the party was going to use the issue vigorously
 ab thik hua bhi vaisaa hi, congress is sambandh main maidan main utaarne ke liye poster taiyaar kar liye hai, jinako bade paimaane par lagaaya jaayegaa or soshal media par prachaarit kiya jayega
 The poster features Rahul Gandhi and Sheila Dixit along with Sonia Gandhi
 poster main vaada kiya gaya he ki 27 fisadi pichde varg ko upi menaarakshan mila he, lekin ati pichhadaa varg ko uskaa phayda nahin mila, isliye congress satta main ai to obisi cote ke andar hi wo embisi ke liye alag se cote kaa praavdhaan karegi
 In the information provided by the party's advisor Prashant Kishore, it has been said that this issue will be included in the manifestos of the Congress and if the Congress comes to power, it will give separate reservation to the most backward of the state within that 27 percent reservation which Is kept for backward castes
 isi cote ke bheetar alag se atipichdi jatiyonke liye ye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 However, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari does not consider it a politics of casteism
 unka kahana he ki congress garib, kisaan or vanchiton kii madad ke liye baat karti he or usee makasad se ati pichhadaa varg ke haq kii baat kar rahi he
 It is worth noting that there is a system in about 10 states including Bihar where the state governments have identified the obcs within the quota of backward castes and given them separate reservation
 bihar main to nitish kumaar ne is aarakshan vyavastha ko panchayat or nikaay chunaavon main lagu karke bharpoor chunavi phayda bhi liya he

 Among the backward castes in Bihar, the most backward castes and the Dalits were made Mahadalits, which Nitish Kumar had a great electoral advantage
 congress ne kaha he ki 80 ke dashak main maharashtra or karnataka main congress ne aisi hi aarakshan kii vyavstha kii thi jahaan pichhadi jatiyon ke cote se ati pichhadi jatiyon ko diya gaya he
 At the same time, the Congress now wants to try in Uttar Pradesh

 The Indian Navy relies heavily on its only fighter jet, the mig-29k, purchased from Russia for its strong presence from the maritime coastline to remote areas
 lekin niyantran evam mahalekhapareekshak (kaig) ke mutabik isaki sthiti itani kharaab he ki yah vastav main upyog ke liye hi uplabdh nahin he
 The CAG has submitted its report in Parliament in this regard two days ago
 navy ke mig-29 kaarykram kaa audit karne ke baad yah report pesh kii gai he
 In it, the CAG has said, "A significant portion of the multi-role and air defense of the Naval Fleet are suffering from mig-29 problems
 '' iske ingine main kharabiyon samet kai samasyaayein hai
 This means that "whenever it needs to be deployed, it will remain fully fit for operations in less than 50 percent of cases even in the best of conditions
" '' It may be noted that India had purchased 45 such aircraft during 2004-10
 ise desh ke pramukh yudhpot ienes vikrant par tainaat kiya gaya he
 It will also be the main fighter aircraft of Vikrant, the aircraft carrier being built in Kochi
 is baat kii bhi puri sambhaavna he ki yah abhi dizin str par chal rahe tisare vimanavahak pot vishaal kaa bhi mukhya ladaaku vimaan hoga
 The CAG report states that ever since the mig-29s were inducted into service in 2010, half of these engines have found design flaws
 iske chalate isaki surakshit udaan ek gambhir masalaa he
 Apart from this, it is not completely comfortable even during the process of landing on the narrow deck of the aircraft carrier
 is dauraan bhi isko kai dikkaton kaa saamana karte dekha gaya he
 Along with this, the CAG report added that "despite many modifications and improvements in the design, many flaws have been found
 " in khaamiyon ke barambar utpann hone ke chalate 'nausena payalton ke training kaarykram par bura asar padaa he

 The CAG has submitted its report in Parliament in this regard two days ago
 navy ke mig-29 kaarykram kaa audit karne ke baad yah report pesh kii gai he
 In it, the CAG has said, "A significant portion of the multi-role and air defense of the Naval Fleet are suffering from mig-29 problems
 '' iske ingine main kharabiyon samet kai samasyaayein hai
 This means that "whenever it needs to be deployed, it will remain fully fit for operations in less than 50 percent of cases even in the best of conditions
" '' It may be noted that India had purchased 45 such aircraft during 2004-10
 ise desh ke pramukh yudhpot ienes vikrant par tainaat kiya gaya he
 It will also be the main fighter aircraft of Vikrant, the aircraft carrier being built in Kochi
 is baat kii bhi puri sambhaavna he ki yah abhi dizin str par chal rahe tisare vimanavahak pot vishaal kaa bhi mukhya ladaaku vimaan hoga
 The CAG report states that ever since the mig-29s were inducted into service in 2010, half of these engines have found design flaws
 iske chalate isaki surakshit udaan ek gambhir masalaa he
 Apart from this, it is not completely comfortable even during the process of landing on the narrow deck of the aircraft carrier
 is dauraan bhi isko kai dikkaton kaa saamana karte dekha gaya he
 Along with this, the CAG report added that "despite many modifications and improvements in the design, many flaws have been found
 " in khaamiyon ke barambar utpann hone ke chalate 'nausena payalton ke training kaarykram par bura asar padaa he
 ' NDTV se baat karte hue varisht nausena adhikariyon ne sweekaar kiya he ki iskaa taatkaalik koi samaadhaan najar nahin aata

 Senior naval officers while talking to NDTV have acknowledged that there is no immediate solution to this
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki mig-29ke vikalp kii kharid par bhi bahut kehane kii sthiti main nahin hai kyonki isaki kharid ek 'package deal' kaa hissaa thi jisamen vimanavahak pot gorshkove ke hastantaran or naveekaran kii yojana bhi shaamil thi
 Gorshkov has been included by the Navy in its fleet as INS Vikramaditya
 tippaniyan He also says that when it was not deployed on the aircraft carrier, a team of engineers from the Russian manufacturer was sent to its base in Goa to address technical problems
 varisht adhikari is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki mig-29ke ko shaamil karne vaala bharat pehla oparator tha
 Even before the Russian Navy it was incorporated here
 yadhyapi unka yah bhi kahana he ki nae plateform kii dikkaton se nipatane main samay lagata he lekin iske liye bahut chintit hone kii jarurat nahin he kyonki rus ne bhi apane sukhoi kii jagah isi mig-29ke ko bede main shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya he
 However, sources in the Indian Navy hesitantly say that the Russians will undoubtedly benefit from the Indian experience of improving and improving recurring problems
 unka yah bhi kahana he jab isko vimanavahak pot par tainaat nahin kiya gaya tha to goa main sthit iske base par roosi nirmaataa ke ejiniyaron kii ek team ko takneekee dikkaton kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye bheja gaya tha

 In the era of slavery, Khadi was a symbol of India's desire for self-reliance and independence
 aazaadee ai to khaadi netaji kii poshaak ke taur par pratishthit ho gai
 And in the second decade of the twenty-first century, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to present it to the world as a pompous Indian brand that has no match
 is teesri pahal se jahaan bharat ke laghu udyog ko bada bazaar milegaa, vahiin duniya main bhartiyata kaa prasar bhi hoga
 But is the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) the contractor of Khadi in the country ready for this? Far from developing Khadi as a brand, the Commission has for the past decade shown such negligence in trademark registration and renewal that the Khadi brand has shrunk
 is 30 janvari ko rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii 67veen barsi ke maukey par jab india today ne khaadi kii sehat kaa jayja liya to yah khud kaa marsia padhati najar ai
 According to documents obtained from the Trademark Office, the Commission has lost more than 40 trademarks related to Khadi due to not being renewed in the last 10 years
 trademark kii vaidhata khatm hone kaa matlab he ki ab us naam se koi bhi vyakti yaa sanstha utpaada bechney ke liye swatantra he yaa us trademark ko apane naam register karaane kii prakriya shuru kar sakati he
 Alam is that today the trademark of 'khadi-bharat, khadi-india' outside the grandest showroom of Khadi in Connaught Place has also expired
 yani desh main khaadi ek aise chehre ke saath ji rahi he, jo asal main ab uskaa rah hi nahin gaya he
 The trademark label was renewed as of March 7, 2013, according to a trademark office document
 iske baad ise dandshulk dekar rineu karaane kii avadhi bhi 7 march, 2014 ko khatm ho chuki he
 a senior official of the Trademark Office said, "khadi Gramodyog may be using the label, but legally it does not have full rights at the moment
 ayog ko yah trademark bachaae rahane ke liye ab waisi hi kavayad kerani hogi, jaisi nayaa trademark register karaane ke liye kii jaati he
 "the second thing is that a trademark of one name can register in several categories
 aise main naam ek hote hue bhi takneekee rup se ve alag-alag trademark hote hai
 Most such trademarks named khadi-bharat have lost their legitimacy
 iske alaava khaadi, khaadi gramodyog, prickon or kutir naam se registerd 40 se zyada trademark apni vaidhata kho chuke hai
 The CEO of the Commission and the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Medium and Small Scale Industries b
 ech
 Anil Kumar defends the commission saying, "khadi, Khadi India, Sarvodaya and cottage trademarks have been renewed
 vahiin ‘khaadi bharat’ or desi aahaar ke navinikaran kii arji di gai he
 "they acknowledge that despite the renewal of 'khadi India', the flagship logo of the Commission is technically incomplete due to the non-renewal of" Khadi India "
 vaise in daavon ke baavjood trademark karyaalay ke dastavej main khaadi or kutir trademark ab bhi vaidhata kho chuki suchi main dikh rahaa he
 Even after the details, if you are thinking that the brand of Khadi clothing has been killed, then you are a bit wrong
 darasal in trademark ke khatm hone se gramodyog kaa ek bada bazaar bhi ayog yaa yon kahen, khaadi ke haath se nikal gaya he
 These trademarks were registered only in the '70s or earlier for a full range of herbal products, herbs, furniture, carpets, honey or other medicinal ingredients, cosmetics and the like
 agar koi nijee company hoti to itane samay main khaadi kii saakh, sarkari sangrakshan, sabsidi, dher saare trademark or bazaar main monopoli jaise karkon kaa phayda uthaakar kahin aage pahunch gai hoti
 But except for Khadi garments, all the other products have fallen badly behind
 balki aaj to baba ramdev kaa patanjali santhaan or kai badi companiyaan is tarah ke prakritik or gramodyog se jude utpaadon main nai saakh jamaane main lag gai hai
 Rajya Sabha MP of Samajwadi Party Chaudhary Munavvar Salim Tanj, who mentions Mahatma Gandhi in almost every speech, says, "today Baba Ramdev is talking about promoting village industry by giving a presentation, if the management of Khadi village industry is so If not seen, the village industries would have been doing much better than that
 ”halaat kharaab hai, is baat ko sarkaar bhi sweekaar kar rahi he
 In response to a question in the Lok Sabha on 26 November 2014, Minister of State for MSME Giriraj Singh admitted that 37 trademarks of KVIC are no longer in existence
 sarkaar ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya ki desh main khaadi herbal menhadi, khaadi bidi number 803, khaadi, khadir, khaadi utpann udyog, khadika or khaadi nirol naam se aath trademark nijee companiyon ne registerd kara liye hai
 If you look at the international board, the dream of carrying this brand in the world has already broken
 germany kii company ‘khaadi necharproduct’ puure europe main khaadi trademark se apane herbal utpaada bech rahi he
 The company has registered its trademark in Spain's Harmonization in the Internal Market Office
 iske baad company ko puure europe main khaadi brands ke tahat utpaada bechney ke exclusive adhikaar hasil ho gaye hai
 The government told Parliament that now India has the option to file an application to declare the trademark of the German company illegal
 is kaam ke liye ayog ne kanpur ke swati gramodyog seva santhaan ke madhyam se siemtiar offis main arji daali he
 According to Anil Kumar, there have been three cases of Khadi registration abroad
 do main bharat kii ore se aapatti darj ho chuki he
 Will the government now ask the people who have run the commission in the last 10 years, why did they keep sleeping and how did Bapu's Khadi fall behind

 is
 hamaari jo parformens he wo aankade bataate hai
 In Gujarat socially and economically, development is necessary inside every region
 10 fisadi se upar rahi growth ratjetali bole ki vikaas kaa ek drushtikon he
 The data released by the agency ratings yesterday, which are the largest states in the country, has only one state for five years - which has a growth rate of 10%
 gujarat main saamaajik dhruvikaran karne se rajya ke liye nuksaan hoga, congress isi raste par chalati he to gujarat kaa or bhi nuksaan hoga
 Hollow promises made by the Congress: The Finance Minister said about the Congress manifesto that the Congress has made more than 50 per cent reservation is constitutionally impossible, some of the Congress promises cannot be fulfilled financially
 gujarat ko kul revenyu hi 90 hajaar karod kaa he, lekin congress ke vaayade ke saath gujarat par dabaav hi badhegaa
 Do not reduce the prices of petrol, Arun Jaitley said that the vision of Congress is baseless, which cannot be possible
 congress ne 2008 main kaha tha ki ham kisaanon kaa karj maaf karenge, kul milakar wo rin maafee main 1156 karod rupaya hi gujarat ko diya
 Recently, when crude oil prices increased, the Center asked the states to reduce the duty on petrol and diesel, but the Congress ruled states refused to reduce the money

 kal yani shuukravaar ko namakan kii aakhri taarikh he, lekin bhartiya janata party main pratyaashiyon kii do suchi aane ke baad bhi tikat vitaran charchaa kaa centre bana hua he
 In particular, three veteran party leaders Eknath Khadse, Prakash Mehta and Vinod Tawde have not been given tickets yet
 inke alaava bijepi se rajyasabha sadsy narayan rane ke bete nitesh rane bhi bijepi kii donon soochiyon se gaayab hai
 In such a situation, the discussion is more about why BJP has kept these veterans out of the list so far
 ekanath khadse, prakaash mehta or vinod taavade teenon hi bijepi ke senior netaa hai
 The three leaders were inducted into the cabinet after the BJP government was formed in 2014
 haalanki, ekanath khadse zyada vakt cabinet main nahin rah sake or MIDC jameen ghotaale main naam aane ke baad 2016 main unhen istipha dena padaa
 After this, Khadse kept making such statements on many occasions which were considered to be anti-party
 haal hi main unhone idi kii jaanch ke daayre main aae ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 It is believed that allegations of corruption went against Eknath Khadse
 haalanki, unhone apana namakan kar diya he, jo bijepi ke liye mushkil khadi kar saktaa he
 In fact, Khadse is an MLA from Muktainagar assembly seat and dominates the area
 khadse ke mukaable bijepi ke paas aisa koi cheharaa nahin he, jise maidan main utaara ja sake
 On the other hand, Congress and NCP have been very weak here
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne abtak is seat par koi pratyaashee nahin utaara he
 According to sources, it is also discussed that by giving ticket to his daughter in place of Khadse, the BJP can reconcile and reduce the challenges of this strong seat by removing Khadse's resentment
 vahiin, prakaash mehta kii baat kii jaae to inhen bhi bhrashtachar ke aarope lagane ke baad mantripad se istipha dena padaa tha
 Mehta Ghatkopar is an MLA from the East seat and till now, the BJP has not fielded any candidate for this seat
 yah vidhansabha kshetra bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa he
 Hence, this seat is considered less challenging for BJP
 aise main yah mana ja rahaa he ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii theory par amal karte hue bijepi prakaash mehta ke khilaaf sakht faisla le sakati he
 Vinod wants to give Tawde Sandeshwinod Tawde is a senior BJP leader and a minister in the Fadnavis cabinet
 taavade borivali seat se vidhayak hai
 When leaders are mentioned in the Chief Minister's race, Tawde's name is discussed
 unki mahatvakanksha par bhi siyaasi galiyaaron main baat kii jaati he
 It is said that the party high command is also unhappy with these discussions related to his name
 duusari taraf borivali seat bijepi ke liye sabase surakshit siton main se ek he
 These are the seats where BJP has never lost since 1980
 aise main yahaan vinod taavade kii jagah kisi or naam par daanv khelnaa bijepi ke liye mushkil bharaa nahin hoga
 However, the candidate has not been announced on this seat yet
 lihaaja, do suchi aane ke baad ab agar taavade ko yahaan se tikat diya bhi jaataa he to yah unke liye ek bada sandesh jarur hoga
 Narayan Rane, who left the Shiv Sena Congress in favor of Nitesh and formed his own party, is currently in the Rajya Sabha on a BJP ticket and wants a BJP ticket for his son Nitesh Rane
 buudhvaar ko unhone khud is baat daawa bhi kiya ki duusari suchi main nitesh ko kankawali se tikat diya jayega, lekin bijepi kii duusari suchi main bhi unhen jagah nahin di gai
 It is being told that Shiv Sena's opposition is falling heavily on Nitesh Rane, as the party is adamant that Nitesh Rane should not be given a chance from this seat
 siem fadanvis bhi kah chuke hai ki shivasena se baatcheet ke baad hi faisla kiya jayega
 Perhaps this is the reason why till now Nitesh Rane's name is stuck
 baharhaal, namakan kii aakhri taarikh 4 oktober he
 In such a situation, it is likely that by this evening, the names of the candidates will be declared in the remaining seats, after which the picture will be completely clear whether the party trusts these big faces again or takes some other route

 The latest incident is from Rajasthan, where Vasundhara Raje described the Congress's election symbol Hath as a bloody claw
 isse pehle narendra modi bhi congress par kuch isi tarah kaa prahaar kar chuke hai
 The case is from Barmer in Rajasthan, where former BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje made a controversial statement during her speech saying that Congress has a bloody claw

 There was a special reason behind this time of release

 The creative style of this special story of the story has been linked with the time of release of the trailer, it is clear that there are many secrets in the trailer, which can further increase the fantasy of the film by December

 The interest of the audience is for the interest of science and fiction based films, the more they are interested in the interesting issues of their history
 lekin in historical drama filmon ko bananaa shaayad diarectors ke liye utana aasaan nahin he
 Researching the facts through many years of research and putting it on screen is a big challenge for a director in itself

 In 2011 too, actor Ranbir Kapoor refused to add Fairness Cream
 ranbir kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke products hamaare dimag main resism ko badhaava dete hai
 Some time ago Kangana Ranot was also offered Rs 2 crore for endarsing a fairness cream
 lekin kangana ne ise karne se manaa kar diya
 He told in an interview that since childhood, he does not understand the concept of looking this blonde
 ranbir kapur ke aage is paak abhinetri ne kyon jode haathhaal hi main actor abhaya deol ne ferenes kriim main najar aane vaale celebs par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 According to him, the star seen in Fairness Cream Aids is an irresponsible citizen who is promoting these ads in a country where people's obsession with white color is not hidden from anyone
 abhaya ki is baat se beshak har koi sahamat hoga
 The most sad thing is that Gori Rangat is considered a measure of success in India

 In March this year, the draft Indian Forest (amendment) Bill 2019 was circulated, which aims to reestablish state power over the rights given to tribals and forest dwellers living in forest areas under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006
 
 yah vidheyak forest se judi naukarshahi ko shashakt karne kaa prayaas karata he, jisaki sarvocchata chhattisgarh ke bastar kshetra se utpann vampanthi ugravad ke naye daur ko bhadakaati he
 Moreover, the supremacy of this law deprives the tribals of their traditional rights under the Forest Rights Act brought to remove anger and 'historical injustice'

 Through the Gram Sabha of the forest dwellers, the right to conserve and manage forests was entrusted to them and thus made JFMC indispensable
 isamen kaha gaya he ki agar koi gramin jangal adivasee samudaay sambandhit he, to lakdi or anya van upaj kaa upyog, charaagaah par adhikaar or in wanon kaa sangrakshan or prabandhan 'van vibhaag ke paraamarsh set hoga
 (clause 22)
 iske alaava, yah vidheyak forest beuroperesi ko van adhikaron ke bare main faisla karne kaa adhikaar detaa he or aise wanon ko 'arakshit van' ghoshit karne ke liye muaavje kaa bhugtan karke vyaktigat or saamudayik adhikaron ko khatm karne kii power detaa he
 Clause 26 provides that in case of fire in a reserved forest or theft of forest produce or grazing by cattle, all rights to pasture or forest produce shall be abolished
 isi ke saath ye praavdhaan forest beuroperesi ko van adhikaron ko samaapt karne ke liye vito power dete hai
 Under a new provision (clause 66) in the Armed Forest Bureaucracy and Indemnity Bill, the forest bureaucracy was allowed to use the benefit arms to investigate forest offenses and enter any premises by informing the Gram Sabha on the basis of suspicion has gone
 isse bhi badtar yah he ki yah vidheyak sashastr balon ke liye 'ashaant kshetron' main lagu sashastr bal (visheshadhikaar) adhinium 1958 ke tahat beuroperesi ko aseemit adhikaar detaa he
 Under this, if they commit any excess or wrongdoing, then this law protects them from prosecution
 rajya kii purv anumati ke bina van adhikariyon ke khilaaf koi mukadmaa nahin chalaaya ja saktaa he
 For this, conditional permission will be given for investigation by an Executive Magistrate
 vidheyak kahata he ki beuroperesi ko yah suraksha 'van aparaadh ko rokane ke liye' di ja rahi he
 This privilege will be in addition to the protection prescribed under Section 197 of crpc for certain types of public servants like judges and Armed Forces personnel
 cloj 11 (3) ke tahat van niptaan adhikari ko van bhoomi adhigrahit karne ke liye 1894 ke bhoomi adhigrahan adhinium ke tahat 'colector ke rup main' kaary karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Further, Clause 84 states that such acquisition shall be deemed 'necessary for a public purpose'
 ' haalanki, yah saarvajanik uddeshy kahin bhi paribhaashit nahin he
 The tribals were further weakened
 Clause 66 considers a forest criminal to commit a crime against a forest like a terrorist
 yah kanoon aaropee par yah boj daalata he ki vah khud ko begunaah sabit kare
 While in the rest of the cases the existing criminal law pressures the prosecution to prove the crime
 yah kanoon kisi ek vyakti kii galatiyon ke liye us vyakti alaava puure 'vanavaasi samudaay' yaa rajya main kanoonee taur par panjikrut sanghathan ko doshi tehraata he, lekin ise lekar koi spashtikaran nahin detaa he
 Even this law does not give the state government the right to withdraw the case filed on anyone
 (1976 main van maamalon ko samavarti suchi main sthanantarit kar diya gaya tha)
 Only the central government will have this right
 vidheyak ke masaude main kaha gaya he ki rajya sarkarein raajnneetik labha ke liye darj maamalon ko waapas le leti hai
 This should be curbed as its consequences can be disastrous
 is tarah kaa lacheelaapan van kshetra ke vinaash kaa kaaran he
 The central government will also have the power to abrogate the rights of states and interfere with forest management and most of the offenses in this regard have been made non-bailable
 visheshgyon kii ashankaadivasee adhikaron ke liye kaam karne vaale or kanoon ke adhyaaapak pro
 Sridhar Acharyulu says that this bill increases the powers of forest bureaucracy rather than empowering forest dwellers and thus snatches away the rights given by the FRA
 forest beuroperesi ko van adhikaron kii pahchaan karne or unhen manyata dene kaa adhikaar hoga
 This is completely contradictory in view of the rights and roles of Gram Sabha and other (district and sub-district level) committees
 ve hairaani jataate hue kehete hai, 'varshon puraani bhoomi samasyaon ke peeche forest beuroperesi hi asli kaaran he or yahi asli khalanaayak he
 His power has been made more brutal
 ab adivasee koun sa laabh le sakenge?'centre for policy research kanchi kohli kaa kahana he ki vidheyak main aitihaasik jhagade kaa udhaaharan diya gaya he ki jangalon ko kaise or kiske dwaara shasit kiya janaa chahie
 She says, 'the Forest Rights Act was brought to recognize historically alienated rights
 FRA bhi samudaay aadhaarit sangrakshan ke liye jagah banane kaa ek prayaas tha
 This draft is an attempt to regain control of the forest department
 haalanki yah durupyog ke maamalon main uchit ho saktaa he, lekin iskaa samanyikaran FRA dwaara die gaye loktantric van prashasan ko pehle kii hi tarah bana degaa
 Ironically, the preamble of the bill also talks about people's participation for the protection and welfare of forest dwellers
 yah vidheyak rashtriya str par vikaas kii aakankshaon or antarrashtriya patibaddhtaon ko puraa karne or iske vyapak uddeshyon ke liye van-aadhaarit paaramparik gyaan ko majboot karne kaa samarthan bhi karata he

 karj or sookhe se trast ho aatmahatya karne vaale odisha ke 133 kisaanon kii chitaaon par rajnatik rotiyaan sekane kaa silsilaa tej ho gaya he
 The leaders kept their heads hidden during the series of suicide incidents last year
 lekin ab dhire-dhire mritak kisaanon ke pariwaron se milane-julne or unhen raahat pahunchane kaa dam bharne lage hai
 The highest number of suicides occurred in western Odisha and Bargarh is also at the forefront
 pichley saal yahaan 23 kisaanon ne maut ko gale lagaaya
 Bargarh has now become a new pilgrimage for political parties
 ise purvi bharat kaa vidarbha kaha jane laga he
 Along with Congress, BJP and Biju Janata Dal, the Left parties fighting for their survival are not behind in gathering sympathy for the vote
 isaki shuruyaat pichley saal congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kii thi
 He undertook a padyatra and also personally met the families of the deceased farmers
 modi ne bhi 21 farvari ko bargarh main kisaan raily ke baad yahi kiya yani kisaanon se baatcheet karke unka dard janaa
 But in the politics of protest on the issue of farmer suicides, the Congress came out ahead and BJP came second
 isi sawaal par congress ne vidhansabha nahin chalane di thi
 Perhaps this blossom is going to bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bargarh
 unhone isi maheene duusari baar 21 farvari ko bargarh main kisaan raily kii
 His lieutenant BJP Odisha general secretary Arun Singh and state president Basant Panda etc
 created an atmosphere of rallies in all the districts of the state
 jiladhyakshon ko bheed jutaney kaa kota de diya gaya tha
 It was claimed to bring at least two lakh farmers to this rally of Modi
 7 farvari ko paradeep main rifinary ke locarpan ke baad 21 farvari ko modi kaa bargarh pahunchnaa odisha kii naveen patnayak sarkaar ke liye sirdard ban gaya he
 Although Naveen has raised Rs 35,000 crore for West Odisha farmers
 ke package kii ghoshnaa kii thi par sarkaar ab tak sookhaa or karj ke kaaran itane kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii baat ko nakaarti rahi he
 Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathi says, "according to the report called from the District Magistrates, the cause of suicide is their personal problems rather than drought and debt
 iske baad bhi sarkaar jaanch kar rahi he ki aisi ghatnaayen jin jilon main hui hai, unhen raahat or punarvaas sahaayta di jaae
 In response to Modi's Kisan rally, Naveen Patnaik's strategists also planned their rallies in a hurry
 modi kii raily se pehle hi 18 farvari ko naveen patnayak bargarh se sate hue jilon balangir or kalahandi kaa daura karenge
 One of the reasons behind the sudden intensified political activity in western Odisha is that the Panchayat elections are going to be held in 2017
 inamen bijepi ko apni rajnatik jameen taiyaar kerani he to naveen ke saamne apni jameen ko bachaakar rakhane kii chunauti he
 Biju Janata Dal (BJD) spokesperson Sameer Ranjan Das is excited about the preparations for the Chief Minister's visit
 rajya sarkaar kisaan kalyaan kii yojana ghoshit kar sakati he
 Faced with the activism of BJP and Congress in West Odisha, the BJD government has decided to schedule a new program in Rourkela on 27 February
 us kaarykram main naveen patnayak 650 karod ru
 Will announce a mega irrigation lift scheme
 congress bhi is daanvpech main peeche nahin he
 The state Congress has released a white paper on farmer suicides, which gives figures of 133 farmers' suicides
 lekin sarkaar in aankadon ko sire se nakaar rahi he
 Says senior journalist Kanan Das, "naveen Sarkar has suffered from farmer suicides and ration card scams
 use dar he ki kahin uskaa bana-banaaya janaadhar hi khisakane na lage
 "but Das believes that it does not seem to happen in the recent past because Naveen Patnaik's BPL vote bank is tremendous
" is vot bank main sendhamari karnaa kisi bhi dal ke liye aasaan nahin he
 On the other hand, the BJD leaders are also shaken by the frequent visits of Modi and his ministers to Odisha
 bijepi ko bhi lagata he ki agar panchayat chunaav tak vah apana janaadhar badha saki to yah ek uplabdhi hogi
 BJP leaders are not very aggressive towards the BJD government
 isaki ek vajah yah he ki centre main vidheyakon ko paas karaane main rajyasabha main bijd saansadon kii sahaayta kii jarurat pad sakati he
 On the other hand, the Left CPI, CPI (M), CPI (ML) and Forward Bloc have come on a platform on the question of farmers
 modi kii kisaan raily vaale din hi yani 21 farvari ko vamadal bhubaneshwar main sanyukt sammelan yojit karenge
 Later on March 19, they will also rally in Bhubaneswar
 sipii secretary divakar nayak kehete hai, ''16 saal se shashan kar rahe bijd ne krishi ke sawaal par kuch nahin kiya
 The central and state governments are equally responsible for the plight of Odisha
 ''nav nirmaan krishak sanghathan ke netaa akshay kumaar ne kisaanon ko ek quintal dhan, paanch hajaar ru
 And has demanded a security allowance of the same amount
 unhone rajya ke 36 lakh kisaan pariwaron ko 21,600 karod ru
 On February 18, a farmers' conference has been called to demand pension (4% of the state budget)
 isse pehle 17 farvari ko katak se 20,000 kisaan padayatra nikaalkar bhubaneshwar jaaenge
 The organization says that 70 percent of the state's population is dependent on farming for its livelihood, but the government is completely oblivious to them
 krishak sanghathan ke sanyojak ashok pradhan kii maane to june, 2015 se lekar ab tak puure rajya main 200 se bhi zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Of these, 35 farmers belong only to Bargarh (23 according to the Congress whitepaper and media)
 udhar mukhyamantri patnayak ne is disha main mahatvapurn kadam bhi uthaae hai
 He asked Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to provide Rs 3,500 crore for drought and debt stricken farmers
 kii raahat maangi he
 He budgeted 10,900 crores for agriculture
 alag se rakhe or isamen biju krishak kalyaan yojana ke tahat kisaanon ke liye ek lakh ke beemaa kaa bhi praavdhaan rakhaa
 According to the National Sample Survey Organization, 57 in Odisha
 5 fisadi kisaan parivaar karj main duube hue hai
 The monthly income of a farmer family here is Rs
 4,976
 he
 According to Odisha Economic Survey 2014-15, the growth rate of agriculture is 12 in 2013
 3 fisadi thi, lekin samudri tufaan or baadh ke kaaran yah dar is kadar nakaaratmak ho gai ki 1
 It was reduced to 97 percent
 odisha main ab yah sthiti he ki kisaanon kii ridh kii haddi tut gai he
 People are migrating to cities and other states for wages
 felin samudri tufaan se peedit kisaanon ko abhi tak muaavja nahin mila he
 But the government definitely got the disaster management award
 kisaan netaa shailaja ravi kehete hai, ''aaj tak odisha sarkaar ne khetihar mazdooron kii pahchaan nahin karai, jabaki aatmahatya karne waalon main unheen kii sankhya zyada he
 15,000 per acre on behalf of government entities Rs
 kaa karj diya jaataa he, jo ki bahut kam he
 "there are around 70 lakh farmer families in Odisha, of which 60 per cent are agricultural laborers
 odisha kii 80 fisadi kheti yahi khetihar majdoor karte hai
 Although the government enacted the Land Reforms Act for agricultural farmers in 1965, it was not implemented
 naveen patnayak sarkaar ne 2011 main is kanoon main sanshodhan tay kiya tha, lekin yah bhi lagu nahin hua
 If this law comes into force then the shareholder farming laborers will get the same rights as ordinary farmers
 yani karj, beemaa yojana kaa laabh
 At present, the government has sought an opinion from the advocate general on the legal protection of agricultural farmers
 sarkaar ab unhen das hajaar karod ru
 Is considering giving loan to the government, that is, the government's way of making farmers indebted
 mumkin he isse unki raah kuch aasaan ho sake
 Where is the report of the Farmers Commission? The Odisha government did not even implement the report of the State Farmers Commission, even to the public

 In this, it was recommended to make farming-employment employable and to take necessary steps for the welfare of farmers by creating different categories of farming according to seed, manure, irrigation, climate

 " dilli vidhansabha kaa bajet satr shuru ho gaya jisamen alji kaa abhibhaashan hua
 In which the government stated its vision for the future of Delhi, about which the BJP called it a 'dream vision'
 dilli bijepi netaa or dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa vijendra gupta ne kaha jis sarkaar ke mukhyamantri ek varsh main dilli ko landan or paris banane kaa swapn dekh rahe hon, uske paas bhavishya or visheshkar aage aane vaale ek varsh ke liye koi duuradrushti hi nahin he
 After listening to the speech, it seemed that the AAP government was so busy in the elections of other states that it did not get time to think anything for Delhi
 vijendra gupta nekejariwal sarkaarper tanj kasate hue uparajyapal kaa abhibhaashan sarkaar dwaara chalaae ja rahe prachaar abhiyaan kaa saransh maatr bataaya
 He said, it appears that it has been created by keeping the advertisements prepared by the government in view of the corporation elections
 sarkaar ke saamne bhavishya ke liye apni nitiyaan prastut karne kaa yah ek svarnim avasar tha, parantu sarkaar ne isko gavaan diya
 Since 99 percent of Delhi's population lives within the jurisdiction of Eastern, Northern and Southern Municipal Corporations and the area of these three corporations is 96 percent of some area of delhi
 phir bhiuparajyapalane nagar nigamon ko aarthik va nitigat drushtikon se poshit karne ke bare main kuch nahin kaha
 Vijender Gupta said that he hoped that the government would come up with some new schemes for the corporations in view of the upcoming elections
 aakhir kaisedilliko saaf-suthra, svachh or smart banaaya ja sake parantu sarkaar ne nigamon kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya
 It seems that in the coming time, the government's attitude towards corporations will remain the same
 vijendra gupta ke mutabik dilli kii ek tihaai se bhi adhik aabaadi anadhikrut coloniyon, jhuggi-jhopadi samoohon, purnvas bastiyon tathaa slam kataron main rahati he, parantu sarkaar ne uparajyapal ke madhyam se in kshetron ke vikaas ke liye koi kargar va vistrut yojana pesh nahin kii

 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu inspected the new Humsafar Express designed with better passenger facilities
 railmantri ne yatriyon se mili feedback ke aadhaar par modern coach factory ko humsafar express ke dibbon main kai badlaavon kaa suzav diya tha
 Railways have made many unique changes in AC 3 Tier coaches
 nai humsafar train main asi thri-tear dibbe main is baar toilet main urinal or bacchon ke liye nappy changing teble lagaae gaye hai
 For the first time, both these things are being provided by Indian Railways in these coaches
 raibareli kii modern coach factory main taiyaar nai humsafar train ko dekhne ke baad railmantri suresh prabhu santusht dikhe
 He said that Indian Railways is giving full emphasis to improve passenger amenities further
 naihumsafar expreske dibbon main hamane behatar suvidhaayen dene kii koshish kii he
 He said that the new changes made in the AC three-tier coach will definitely make the journey of people enjoyable
 modern coach factory ke jiem mahesh kumaar gupta ne bataaya ki asi thri tear ke nae coach main sabase bada badlaav toilet main urinal feet kiya janaa he
 Usually, there are no separate urinals for urinating in the toilet of the train
 is vajah se log toilet ke camod par hi peshaab kar diya karte the
 Due to this, the toilet of the train becomes quite dirty
 isse railway kii chhavi ko kaaphi dhakka pahunchataa he
 To deal with this problem, the toilet was sent to the National Institute of Design of the railway to be redesigned
 neshnal institute of digining ne railway ke toilet main kai badlaav sujhaaye
 The major change in these changes is the urinal set in the railway toilet
 iske alaava railway ke toilet main bacchon kii nappy badalane ke liye alag se teble lagaae gaye hai
 Railway officials say that this has been done because the women traveling alone with a small child used to have difficulty in going to the toilet
 iske maddenjar bacchon kii nappy badalane ke liye ek dibbe ke do toilet main nepi changer teble lagaai gai he
 The advantage will be that any single woman can use them to change the nappies of her child
 saath hi saath agar use toilet janaa he to vah chote bachche ko nappy changer seat par seat belt ke jariye surakshit baandhakar bitha bhi sakati he
 Apart from this, the color scheme of the toilet of the train has been kept in such a way that no one can write on its walls
 train ke toilet main cigarette pine vaale logon se nipatane ke liye railway ne is baar toilet main fire sensor bhi lagaae hai
 In such a situation, a fire alarm will start sounding after smoking cigarette and bidi
 iske alaava asi thri tear main bada badlaav kiya gaya he
 It is usually said that people used to get upset when they got a side lower berth
 said loar berth main seat ko do hisse hote hai
 Both the parts are lifted and made to sit
 haalanki do hisse hone kii vajah se said loar berth par letne vaale ko kaaphi pareshaani hoti he
 The design of the side lower berth has been changed to deal with this problem
 said loar berth main upar se kushan de diya gaya he
 The cushion is pulled over the seat
 is vajah se ab is seat par sone waalon ko qamar dard kii shikaayat nahin hogi
 There is a possibility of misuse of GST composition scheme introduced to benefit small businessmen
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki kaarobaari apana sahi turnover nahin dikhaa rahe hai, jisaki vajah se sarkaar ko kam tex mil rahaa he
 Between July and September, 1 million companies took composition schemes
 is skim ke tahat kaarobaariyon ko sirf apni company kii turnover detail saajha kerani hoti he
 Under this, tax is paid at a fixed rate

 The total amount during the three months has been Rs 251 crore
 isse salanaa turnover 8 lakh rupee tak hota he, jabaki sarkaar ne is skim ke tahat ausat turnover 2 lakh rupee rahane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 On the basis of the average estimate and the turnover coming in the form of returns, the officials are worrying that the government is not losing revenue in the name of this scheme

 In such a situation, we are wondering whether there is even a need to increase the maximum limit

 Under this, the annual income limit was raised to 2 crore

 In such a situation, the authorities are also apprehensive that the beneficiaries of the scheme are not reporting correctly
