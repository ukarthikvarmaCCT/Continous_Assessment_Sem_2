 Asad Rauf, 59, has umpired in 98 odis and 23 T20 Internationals with 49 Tests
 rauf kaa kahana he ki jab mumbai kii ek adaalat ne unke khilaaf koi thos subut nahin paaya to bisisiai yaa ipel ke paas unhen bain karne kaa kya haq he
 Further, in his explanation, Rauf said that it was shown that he left India in the middle but did not do so, he completed his contract and after that he returned from India, the commissioner of inquiry appointed by BCCI and IPL

 Earlier, the ICC kept Rauf away from the 2013 Champions Trophy, the reason why the BCCI had informed the ICC about the ongoing investigation in the fixing case against him

" yah unka adhikaar kshetra nahin he
 Dhoni's statement that Fletcher was surrounded by criticism in Bristol as 'boss' and his continuation till the World Cup next year will now be discussed at the next board meeting

 a top official who played a key role in the decisions of the board made it clear that the issue would be raised in the next meeting of the board's executive
 jo kuch hua vah bahut niraashajanak he
 The Indian captain should not have made such a comment
 kai dauron par bhartiya team ke saath manager ke rup main jane vaale is adhikari ne kaha, ‘sahyogi staff kii bhartee karne yaa unke kaarykaal par tippanee karne kaa kaam unhen nahin saunpa gaya he
 'BCCI Secretary Sanjay Patel had already made it clear that the team would now be' under Ravi Shastri 'and Fletcher would have to report to them
 shastri ne bhi kaha ki flechar ko unhen report kerani hogi or vah team ke overal incharge hai
 Dhoni, however, supported coach Fletcher at the press conference, terming him as the 'boss' of the team and said that he would remain till the 2015 World Cup

 M
 joseph ke naam ko manjuuri nahin die jane ko lekar congress or centre sarkaar ke bich sawaal-jawaab kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 The government says that seniority is the biggest obstacle in Justice Joseph's approach to the Supreme Court
 haalanki sarkaar necolegium kii sifarishko rokane ke peeche philhal aupchaarik taur par kuch nahin kaha he, lekin sutron ke mutabik desh bhar main ucch nyaayalayon main sevarat chif justise or jajon kii varishthata suchi main justise joseph kaaphi neeche aate hai
 That is, about three dozen judges are senior to him
 saath hi kshetreey yaa rajyavar santulan ko dekhte hue bhi sarkaar ne justise joseph ko supreme court na bhejne kii thaan rakhi he
 Regarding arbitrariness in appointments, however, as far as seniority is concerned, there is no definite basis nor is there any written rule on the basis of balancing territorial or religious
 centre main kabiz sarkarein apni marzi se is kasuti par apana khel kar hoicourt or supreme court main hit sadhti rahati hai
 Many times seniority has been kept on the watch and judges have been appointed up to the Supreme Court after being promoted from Chief Justice and High Courts in the High Court
 isi apadhapi or apaardarshita kii vajah se kai jajon ne istipha bhi diya
 If there is no reason why the appointment was not stopped, political reasons are also being seen behind this obstruction of the government
 justise joseph ne hi uttarakhand main modi sarkaar ke lagaae raashtrapati shashan ko radd kar congress sarkaar behaal karai thi or bijepi kaa sara khel bigaad diya tha
 Since then, the government is sitting idle

 joseph ko supreme court kaa jaj banaae jane kii sifarish kii thi
 The government kept sitting on the horoscope on this recommendation
 farvari main phir dobaaraa sifarish bheji gai, lekin april ke teesraa haftaa bitne tak sarkaar tus se mas nahin hui
 Several judges have raised questions
 Meanwhile, Justice Chelameswar, then a few weeks later Justice Kurian Joseph and last week Justice Madan B
 Lokur also wrote a letter to Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, insisting on taking measures to save the dignity of the Supreme Court and curbing the arbitrariness of the government
 
 in upayon kii talash ke liye phulcourt yani sabhi jajon kii meeting bulaane kii maang kii
 The Chief Justice is also silent as the government is silent on the recommendations of the Collegium, in the same way Chief Justice Deepak Mishra is silent on the letters getting received one by one from fellow judges
 sutron ke mutabiz ab to colegium ke sadsyjajone ye bhi manshaa jataai he ki jab tak sarkaar colegium kii siforishein na maane tab tak hoicourt or supreme court main nae jajon niyukti kii siforishein nahin bheji jaaen

 He said that he is happy with the love he received for the sequel 'tanu Weds Manu'
 jab unase yah poocha gaya ki kya unke liye paisa mahatv rakhata he to unhone kaha, 'main khud par nirbhar hum,kaam-kaaji ladki hunor dhan se main acchhee jindagi ji sakati hum, apane parivaar waalon kii madad kar sakati hum or vah sab kar sakati hum jisase mujhe khushi milti he

 This decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being considered as the masterstroke before the election
 is faisle ke tahat sarkari naukari or shiksha ke kshetra main savarnon ko aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi aarakshan diya jayega

 Now today is the last day of the session, the challenge is to get this bill passed in front of the government
 wo bhi tab jis dauraan vipaksh puri tarah se aakraamak he
 If sources are to be believed, the Modi government may also consider furthering the session to pass this bill
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki agar sarkaar ko samvidhan sanshodhan bill ko lagu karwaanaa he to use loksabhaa or rajyasabha donon main paas karwaanaa jaruri he
 The NDA government has a majority in the Lok Sabha, but the opposition position in the Rajya Sabha is strong
 aise main sarkaar kii agnipariksha hona tay he
 Yes, yes, this decision of opposition government stuck in no-no is also considered as a masterstroke because many parties have already demanded it
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki somvaar ko jab cabinet kaa faisla aayaa, to kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ne iskaa purajor virodh nahin kiya
 Just raised questions on the government's intention to announce before the election

 dilli vidhaan sabha ke chunaav main bijepi ne bada dhamaakaa karte huepurv ipies officer kiran bedico mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit karke ek sansani failaa di
 Sensational because the party did not announce a CM candidate in any state ruled by opposition parties but did so here
 ise party kii jeet ke liye uthaaya gaya bada kadam kaha jaae yaphir ghabrahat?ab tak party kaa yahi stand rahaa ki vahsiem ummidavaarka naam na ghoshit kare balki baad main tay kare ki koun mukhya mantri banegaa
 This happened in Haryana as well as in Jharkhand
 dilli main bhi aisa hi hota dikh rahaa tha lekin achaanak sab kuch badal gaya
 BJP made Kiran Bedi a contender for the post of CM
 ab jang sidhe do puraane saathiyon or activist ke bich he
 Both former bureaucrats are known for their honesty and combativeness and have been directly associated with Anna's movement
 baharhaal sawaal he ki ise hataasha main yaa haar kii ashanka main uthaaya gaya kadam mana jaae yaa phir ek ranneeti? iskaa jawaab isamen hi he
 Both things seem correct at the moment
 kejariwal kii saaf suthri chhavi ke tod ke jawaab main bijepi ne bedi ko utaara he
 But directly making him the chief ministerial candidate gives rise to a lot of speculation
 party ke liye dilli ke chunaav pratishtha kaa maamla he
 PM Modi would not like to see the rule of another party right under his nose in Delhi and hence his trusted Amit Shah has thrown the trump card in this fight
 isse party jeet kii ummid to kar sakati he lekin uske kaaryakartaaon or khaskar un netaaon par jo varshon se party main jude rahakar sapane bun rahe the, kya gujri he? kya saare saansad or vidhayak unka saath de denge? kya party in chunaavon main ekajutata dikhaa paaegi?sawaal kai saare hai or inke jawaab aasaan nahin honge
 The party will now have to win another war and have to take along its angry leaders
 uske bagaiyr vah chunaav jeetne kii soch bhi nahin sakati
 Fraud in the parties is a minor matter and those who have seen the last election of Delhi Legislative Assembly will know why the party did not reach power even after the anti-sheila wave in the capital
 ab bhavishya hi batayega ki kiran bedi bijepi kii naav ko paar karvaa sakati hai yaa nahin
 For the moment, listen to the echo of Ranbiris
 lekin kejariwal yah to kah hi sakate hai ki yah unki upasthiti thi ki bijepi ko ek behad eemaandaar ummidavaar utaarna padaa or dilli kii raajnneeti main ek badlaav aayaa

 (input- bhashaa se) The final leg of the title fight in the seventh edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will begin with the first qualifier match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Kings XI Punjab at the Eden Garden Stadium in Kolkata on Wednesday
 yah match mangalvaar ko hona tha, lekin barish ke kaaran ab ise aaj yojit kiya jayega

 The second eliminator match of the playoff stage will also take place on Wednesday between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium
 yah match shaam 8 baje se shuru hoga
 While the Qualifier-1 match is now a season, the thrill of the second match is telling the heads of the IPL fans
 aisa isliye bhi he, kyonki khitaabi jang main gat champion or gat up vijeta ek baar phir ek-duusare ke aamane-saamne honge
 The Chennai Super Kings team, which had reached the last four of every edition of the IPL so far, had lost the final match to Mumbai Indians last year, which they will surely want to avenge today
 duusari ore shuruaati asafalataaon ke baad jabardast vaapasi karte hue apane aakhri lig match main mumbai indiens ne jis andaaj main jeet darj kar plaof main pravesh kiya, usase unka hausala nishchit taur par nae ufaan par rahegaa
 It will not be easy for Mumbai Indians on Wednesday in front of a home audience at the Wankhede Stadium, but to overcome a very balanced team like Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings
 mumbai indiens ke captain rohit sharma ek aisi team kii kaman sambhaal rahe hai, jisane ab tak ek yaa do khilaadiyon ke shandaar pradarshan ke bal par jeet darj kii he
 On the other hand, Dhoni's team Super Kings is a team that has full confidence in its openers, who have full confidence in their captain and who leads their team to victory by keeping them positive under any circumstances and who have to give their bowlers Is also confident
 kul milakar superkings ek aisi team he jo har vibhaag main behad santulit or sakaaratmak najar aati he
 But in the last few matches, the Super Kings' fast bowling attack has not been able to leave a special effect, which will surely be their concern
 in par rahengi nigahen : Big hitters Anderson and mccallum: Mumbai Indians' batting batting Corey Anderson has returned to the rhythm and will be expected to contribute significantly in this important match, while Super Kings one Brendon mccullum is not only in the rhythm but also looks very aggressive
 Huh
 kiski phiraki main fansega koun : mumbai indiens ke mukhya spin gendbaaj harbhajan singh ab tak sunil naren ke baad duusare sabase kifayati gendbaaj hai, jabaki super kings ke ravindra jadeja naren ke baad duusare sarvaadhik wicket chatakaane vaale phiraki gendbaaj hai
 Jadeja has played the role of the best all-rounder
 naren ke baad ipel-7 main do baar chaar wicket jhatakane kaa karnama karne vaale ekmaatr gendbaaj bhi hai jadeja
 In today's match, it will be interesting to see whether the winning team wins on the strength of the performance of a particular player or on the strength of the team's united performance
 timen (sambhavit) : Chennai Super Kings: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Dwyane Smith, Brendon mccallum, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, David Hussey, Mithun Manhas, Samuel Badri, Ashish Nehra
 mumbai indiens : rohit sharma (captain), lendil simons, mike hasi, kori anderson, keeran pollard, ambati raidu, aditya taare, harbhajan singh, shreysh gopal, pragyan ojha, jasprit bumara

 ’ Sources close to Prashant Kishore, a 37-year-old election strategist who had won the strategy for the election campaigns of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the past, claim that the Congress is the only Congress for the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Will continue to be the chief strategist of
 tivi channelon tathaa samachaarpatron main prakashit reporton main daawa kiya gaya tha ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se 'udhaar' liye gaye prashanth kishor ko congress nikaalane ja rahi he
 Prashant Kishore is said to have annoyed the Congress by meeting Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, which has been following the tradition of following leaders in its top positions
 pichley saptaah prashanth kishor ne dilli main mulaayam singh yadav se mulaakaat kii thi, or congress ke upi adhyaksh raaj babbar ke anusaar, prashanth kishor ko is kadam kii ijazat nahin di gai thi
 Speaking to NDTV, Raj Babbar had said, "this is an independent country, he can meet anyone
" 
 
 " saath hi raaj babbar ne samaajawaadee party se tab tak gathbandhan sthapit karne ke prati congress kii anichhaa par bhi jor diya, jab tak mulaayam singh yadav apane putr tathaa upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se jari jang ko khatm nahin kar dete
 But without being distracted by this criticism, Prashant Kishore also held a nearly two-hour meeting with Akhilesh Yadav on Monday, which is being seen as 'defiance once again' within the Congress
 lekin prashanth kishor ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he, "congress ke bheetar maujuud log hi is tarah kii kahaniyaan failaa rahe hai
 
 
 He (prashant Kishore) is still working for the party
 
 
 " Since March this year, when Prashant Kishore pledged to formulate the Congress's election strategy, he has been continuously opposed within the party by people who may feel uncomfortable with his unabated access to the Gandhi family, Because this family is the axle of the party
 prashanth kishor ke virodhiyon main gulam nabi azaad or raaj babbar shaamil rahe hai, or haalia dinon main inamen ahamed patel kaa naam bhi jud gaya he, jo congress pramukh sonia gandhi ke sheersh sahaayak hai
 Sources have denied that Prashant Kishore was discussed in detail in the Congress Working Committee meeting held on Monday
 party kii nirnay lene vaali sheersh sanstha ke is satr kii adhyakshata party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kii thi, kyonki unki maa tathaa party adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii tabiyat thik nahin thi

 Cricket Australia (CA) has banned the black bat of West Indies cricketer Andre Russell in their Big Bash League (BBL)
 sie ne toornament main sidney thunder ke pehle match main rasel ko is balle ke upyog kii ijaajat di thi
 Significantly, Russell had batted with a black bat in the match against Sydney Sixers on Tuesday
 yah match thunder kii team haar gai thi
 CA had earlier said that players can use colorful bats but for this they have to get permission from CA
 sie ne kaale yaa team kii jersey vaale rang ke balle kii hi ijaajat dene kii baat kahi thi
 That is why Russell was cleared to play with the black bat
 sie ne ab is manjuuri ko waapas le liya he or isaki vajah usne gend par balle se bane nishaanon ko bataaya he
 The comments website iespncricainfo ne bibiel ke mukhiya anthony everard ke hawaale se likhaa he, "match adhikariyon ne cricket australia ko bataaya ki andre rasel ke balle se gend par nishaan ban gaye hai
 As a result, we are withdrawing Russell's approval to play with the black bat because the colors used by the bat-making company are going to spoil the ball
 " unhone kaha, "agar koi bhi bibiel yah dablyubibiel khilaadi us tareeke ke rang-birange balle kaa prayog karata he yaa karti he jisase gend kaa rang kharaab nahin ho or khel bhaavana bani rahe to sie us par vichaar kar saktaa he
 " gauratlab he ki rasel isse pehle gulabi rang ke bat se ballebaaji karne ko lekar bhi charchaa main aa chuke hai
 In July this year, he landed batting in the Caribbean Premier League with a pink bat
 yah alag baat he ki unka gulabi bat sirf 2 gendon tak hi chal paaya tha
 In the course of playing a shot, the ball hit the bottom of his pink bat and cracked, then he had to change his bat
 haalanki bat badalane ke baavjood rasel ke khilne kaa andaaj nahin badla or unhone apane chirparichit andaaj main batting karte hue jamaica talawahs kii ore se 24 gendon main 44 ran bana daale the
 Not only this, he also took 4 wickets in bowling

 CA had asked to allow only black or team colored jersey bat
 isi kaaran rasel ko kaale balle se khilne kii manjuuri mil gai thi
 CA has now withdrawn this approval and has attributed it to the bat marks on the ball
 tippaniyan The website espncricinfo quoted BBL head Anthony Everard as saying, "match officials told Cricket Australia that Andre Russell's bat has made marks on the ball
 parinamswaroop ham rasel ko kaale balle se khilne ko di gai manjuuri ko waapas le rahe hai kyonki balla banane vaali company ne isamen jin rangon kaa prayog kiya he, ve gend ko kharaab karne vaale hai
 "he said," If any BBL or WBBL player uses a colorful bat in a manner that does not spoil the color of the ball and maintains the spirit of the game, CA may consider it
 " It is worth mentioning that Russell has also come in the discussion about batting with pink colored bat before this
 isi saal july main ve caribbean premier lig main gulabi bat lekar batting ko utre the
 It is a different matter that his pink bat was able to run for only 2 balls
 ek shot khilne ke chakkar main gend unke gulabi bat ke nichle hisse main lagi or usamen daraar aa gai phir unhen apana bat badalanaa padaa
 However, despite changing the bat, Russell's style of playing did not change and he batted in his well-known style, scoring 44 off 24 balls for Jamaica Talawhas
 yahi nahin, unhone gendbaaji main bhi 4 wicket chatkaaye the
 Cricket expert Peter Miller tweeted this photo of Russell at the time

 cinema jagat main mahilaayein aaj se pehle itani sakriy nahin rahi hai, lekin kya ve bollywood ke abhinaytaon jaisi pratishtha paa sakengin? bollywood abhinetri bipasha basu kaa maananaa he ki aisa kabhi nahin hoga
 Bipasha said in the interview, the opportunity for women in Bollywood is very less
 hamaare paas surakshit rahane, khubasurat dikhne or kuch item gane karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 'dirty Picture', 'saat Khoon Maaf' and 'no One Killed Jessica' have seen a growing trend of women characters
 lekin bipasha ne kaha, ek 'darty pikchar' bahut kuch nahin badal sakati
 You are sometimes lucky that you get films like 'dirty Picture', 'raj', 'jism' and 'corporate'
 unka kahana he ki ek film ke aate hi log kehane lagate hai ki mahila kirdaaron kaa chalan shuru ho gaya
 33-year-old Bipasha, who started her career with the film 'ajnabee', said, "all of us, including my contemporary actresses, are going through this
" chaahe ham jitna bhi kahen ki film udyog badal rahaa he, yah hero kendrit vyavsaay he or yah hameshaa rahegaa
 Bipasha has spent more than a decade in Bollywood, 'raj', 'jism', 'no Entry', 'dhoom-2', 'kidnapping', 'corporate', 'race', 'bachna Ae Haseeno' and more recently Has acted in 'raj 3'
 tippaniyan However, he believes that some positive changes have occurred
 bipasha ne kaha, kuch aise kushal filmkaar hai, jo film banaate hai unka aabhaar jataana chahie isliye nahin ki ve nari adhikaaravaadi hai, balki isliye ki vah manoranjan hoti he or usamen mahilaon ke karne ke liye bhi kuch hota he
 As an actress you have to search for such a film

 He says that as soon as a film comes, people start saying that the trend of female characters has started
 'ajanabi' film se kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaali 33 varshiya bipasha ne kaha, meri samakaleen abhinetriyon sahit ham sabhi isse guzar rahe hai
 No matter how much we say that the film industry is changing, it is a hero-centric business and it always will be
 bollywood main ek dashak se zyada samay bitaa chukin bipasha ne 'raaj' , 'jism', 'no entry', 'dhooma-2' , 'apharan', 'korporate', 'res' , 'bachanaa e hasino' or haal hi 'raaj 3' main abhinay kiya he
 The comments haalanki , unka maananaa he ki kuch saakaratmak badlaav aae hai
 Bipasha said, "there are some skilled filmmakers who make films that should be thanked not because they are female rightists, but because they are entertainment and have something for women to do

 a post shared by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Dec 26, 2018 at 7:17pm PST Preparing to celebrate a very beautiful girl's birthday in a luxurious hotel
 khushnuma maahaul, doston ke thahaake, mujeec kii dhun, teble par sajaa berthde kek, us par lagi khaas tareeke kii candal jo phuljhadi kii tarah jalati he, bahut saare surkh laal or kaale gubbaaron kii sajaavat
 The girl wearing a sky-colored sleeveless gown smiles and approaches the birthday cake
 tamaam dost is yaadgaar pal ko camere main kaid karne ke liye saamne khadey ho jate hai
 The girl burns the matchstick and takes it to the candle
 candal se pataakhe kii tarah kuch chingaari nikalati he
 But before that the voice of Happy Birthday to You echoed
 dhadaam !!! kii awaz
 
 
 There is a great flame of fire and the noise of screaming
 goun vaali berthde girl chillaate hue badahavaas bhaagate hue dikhti he
 And the video ends
 pichley kuch dinon se dil dahalane vaala ye video aag kii tarah soshal media par fail rahaa he
 In all the videos running on social media, it is also being said that the balloons were filled with helium gas, due to which the explosion and fire spread
 khabaron or soshal media main do or photo khub dikh rahi hai
 In the first photo, a girl is seen sitting on the bed in burnt condition, which looks like a picture taken in the bedroom
 duusari photo main ek ladki laal rang kii sari main saji dhaji dikh rahi he jo dekhne se modiling ke liye profeshnal tareeke se lee gai tasviir lagati he
 It is said that both the pictures are of the same girl whose birthday party caught fire in the balloons and she got badly burnt
 internet par agar aap in tasveeron ko khonje to aap ye dekh kar hairaan rah jaaenge ki ye khabar kis kadar viral he
 Not only newspapers of all languages of India, you will see this news on the website of many foreign newspapers
 vahi teen tasviren-berthde manaati ladki or dhamaakaa, bistar par baithi ladki jisamen dekha ja saktaa he ki uski bahen jhulasi hui hai or chehre par bhi jalane ke nishaan hai
 The third photo is the smiling photo of a woman dressed in the same red saree
 har khabar main ghatana ke bharat main hone kaa zikr he, lekin kahin par bhi ye nahin pataa chalata ki ye ladki he koun, ye ghatana kahaan kii he or kya ye teenon tasviren ek hi ladki kii hai
 How to do a viral test: We first tried to confirm whether the girl sitting on the bed was the one who got burnt while cutting the birthday cake
 jab hamane berthde vaali video ko slo moshan main dekha to ladki ke baanh par ek tir ke jaisaa tatu dikhataa he jo palak jhapakate hi gaayab ho jaataa he
 The face of the girl sitting on the bed was still meeting the birthday girl, but for sure proof we wanted to find a tattoo on her arm
 thik vahi tatu, jali hui ladki kii baanh par usee jagah dekha ja saktaa he
 That means both photos are of the same girl, it has been decided
 laal sari vaali photo internet par to kai jagah maujuud thi, lekin ye pataa nahin chal paa rahaa tha ki kya ye photo bhi usee ladki kii he
 Now it was to find out who and where this girl lives
 jis photo main ladki bed par baithi hui dikh rahi he agar aap usko dhyaan se dekhen to bagal main ek akhbaar kaa konaa dikhataa he
 It is known from the view that it is a Kannada language newspaper
 is saboot ke aadhaar par hamane kannada ke akhabaaron ko internet par khangaalana shuru kiya to pataa chalaa ki 21 april ko oneindia
 The Kannada edition of com has a news report that the balloon burst during a birthday party at a private hotel in Mysore
 hamane is ladki ke bare main or jaankaree jutaney ke liye oneindia
 Contacted at the office of com
 pataa chalaa ki ye ghatana vaaki mysore kii he
 The girl's name is Babita (name changed) and the incident occurred in Mysore
 aar
 Took place in the city
 babita mysore ke ek college main biessi first year kii chaatr hai
 When we asked Sabina, Vice Principal of the college, about this incident, she refused to talk about it, calling it a personal matter of the girl
 lekin unhone itnaa mana ki jis ladki ke saath ye durghatana hui he wo yaheen padhati he
 Babita's phone number was constantly out of reach
 ab babita or is durghatana ke bare main or jaankaree paane ke liye hamane uske kuch doston se baat kii jo is party main to maujuud nahin the, lekin durghatana ke fouran baad usase mili the
 a friend of his, who did not wish to be named, said that Babita's birthday is on 31 March, but she had a birthday party with friends a week later at a private hotel in Mysore
 babita padhai ke saath-saath modelling bhi karti he
 The photo that is going viral in the red saree is also from him
 durghatana ke kai dinon baad tak parivaar or kareebi doston ke alaava kisi ko iske bare main pataa nahin chalaa
 But a few days later a friend shared the photo of the blast on social media
 iske baad log babita ko khojane lage or kannada media ke kuch logon ne usase mulaakaat bhi kar lee
 During these meetings, someone took this photo quietly in his bedroom and this photo also came on social media
 jab bad gayi ladki kii mushkilenjali hui haalat main photo viral hone ke baad babita kii mushkilen kaaphi bad gayin or uske paas tamaam logon ke phone aane lage
 a few days ago he was also offered to work in a Kannada serial
 babita ne sochaa tha ki wo thik hone ke baad plastic surgery kara kar pehle jaisi ho jaaegi
 But after appearing in this photo, he felt that his career is now going to be destroyed
 babita itani niraash ho gai ki usne apana fasebuk acanut bhi dilit kar diya or apana phone band karke mysore ke baahar ek rishtedaar ke yahaan chali gayi
 Now we understood why something could not be known about the red saree photo and why Babita, despite being a model, could not find any social media address
 jaanch padtaal main kya niklajaha tak baloon main aag lagane kii baat thi, babita ke doston ne bataaya ki vaaki candel jalaane ke baad hi dhamaakaa hua tha
 But did the explosion in the balloon happen because there was helium gas in it
 darasal sachai thik iske ulat he
 If the balloons were filled with helium, it would not catch fire
 gubaare main helium nahin, hydrogen gas bhari thi
 Regarding the danger of a fire in helium, we have received Professor of Chemistry at BHU, Dr
 bi
 B
 prasad se baat kii to unhone bataaya ki helium inart gas he jisamen aag nahin lagati, lekin hydrogen aag lagane ke hisaab se behad khatarnaak gas he
 Abhishek Tripathi, a businessman of birthday balloons in Delhi, says, "people use helium and hydrogen balloons because these gases are lighter than air because they keep the balloons up, which look good in decoration
" hydrogen gas sasti hoti he or helium manhagi
 a balloon filled with hydrogen gas costs about 15 rupees
 vahiin helium se gas se bhare ek gubaare kii keemat 40 rupee
 That's why people mostly use hydrogen gas to save money
 jaahir he, babita ke jalane kii vajah, helium nahin balki hidrogen ke baloons the
 In the viral test, the news came out right, but on most of the social media, the helium gas balloons that people are being warned about are exactly opposite from the truth

 Apna Time Aayega: This new song of Ranveer Singh's film was released on Monday and it started making a big difference on youtube
 hipahop or rap bharat ke liye nayaa nahin he
 Many rappers like Honey Singh, Badshah and Fazilpuria are well heard and their popularity among the youth is amazing
 lekin inkaa prasar or zyada asar abhi metro cities main hi najar aata he
 However, the timing of hip hop and rap culture in the country with Ranveer's Gully Boy may change
 joya akhtar ke nirdesan main bani film main ranvir singh khud rap karte nazar aaenge
 This is the first time that a commercial film inspired by the struggles of a rap artist is coming to Bollywood
 70 ke dashak main neuyork kii galiyon se hota hua hipahop culture ab is film ke saath hi bharat ke andruni kshetron khaskar hindi pattee ke tamaam ilaakon ke yuvaaon ko apni agosh main lene ke liye taiyaar he
 For the first time in Bollywood, pakistani-american singer Bohemia rapped for Akshay Kumar's film
 haalanki iske kuch saalon baad filmon main badshaah or hani singh jaise artists ne hipahop ko commercial banane main yogadan diya
 There has been talk of alcohol and youth in these songs for a long time
 bharat jaise desh main jahaan ek bada tabaka aaj bhi chamak dhamak se dur bas cervive karne kii koshish kar rahaa he, unke liye lambey samay tak aise songs se jude rahanaa mumkin nahin tha
 These songs were perfect for timepassing, but it was difficult for most people to connect with them
 chunki aise rap ke sandarbh bhi duusari duniya ke lagate the, is vajah se bhi ye logon kii jaruraton main zyada pasandida nahin bane
 However, a generation was experimenting with them in all cities
 ab gali boy se us peedi kii aawaaj chaane ko taiyaar he

 mumbai kii jhuggiyon kii zindagi ho, karpshan or garibi kii maar yaa phir kashmir main banduukon ke saae main jivan, emasi kaash, divine, emive banatai jaise kai reppers hai jo saamaajik, nijee or vaicharik muddon par rap parform kar rahe hai
 But the effect of this voice is also limited to one area
 kuchhek apwaad chhodkar
 But Gully Boy can revolutionize rap in the youth at large
 yuvaaon main mujeec sunne or use pasand karne kaa najariya bhi badal saktaa he
 Because the use of the street in addition to the existing rap, its effect can not be underestimated

 chaturaai bhare vardeple ke saath sadhe bol or beats, rap kii vidha ko duusare gaanon se alag banaate hai
 The migration also has its own beauty in hiphop culture
 multicultural hone ke kaaran hi duniya ke har hisse main har bhashaa main rap banaaya ja rahaa he
 This is the reason that these rappers dominated the underground level for the last few years and in a few years this culture has seen a tremendous increase in popularity and now with the film of Ranveer, this culture is ready to make its place in the mainstream
 ranvir kii film jaise-jaise charchaaon main aati jaaegi vaise-vaise desh ke chote shaharon main hipahop culture kaa nayaa udai dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 It can be said that Gully Boy is the turning point where the likes of new generation can affect the way of listening

 India has decided to buy only 36 French aircraft, canceling the earlier deal to buy 126 Rafale fighter jets because of the high cost
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne 126 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid ke liye upie sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye 20 arab dollar ke saude ko 'aarthik rup se avyaavhaarik' bataaya
 When the Defense Minister was asked what would be the requirement of the rest, he said in an interview to PTI, "we are not buying the rest of the aircraft
" ham keval sidhe 36 vimaanon ko kharid rahe hai
 Parrikar said that the UPA deal to buy 126 Rafale aircraft was too expensive and it would have hampered other modernization plans of the Indian Army
 unhone kaha ki saude ke liye 10 se 11 saal kii avadhi main kareeb 1
 3 lakh crores was required
 unhone kaha, kya anya kisi kaam ke liye paisa rahata? raksha mantri ne kaha, mujhe bhi lagata he ki mere paas bmdablyoo or marsdes ho
 But i do not keep, because i cannot afford it
 pehali baat to main iskaa kharch nahin uthaa saktaa or duusari baat ki mujhe isaki jarurat nahin he
 Therefore 126 Rafale aircraft are economically impractical
 ye jaruri nahin hai
 During his visit to France last month, Prime Minister narendramodi announced the decision to purchase 36 Rafale aircraft with the status of flying under a government-to-government (G2G) agreement
 tippaniyan Parrikar questioned the tendering process initiated by former Defense Minister AK Antony and said that Antony put up hurdles in the tender process in such a way that the Rafael deal could never be implemented

 Parrikar said that the deal has not been signed yet and he should wait till the process is over
 raksha mantri ne vishwaas jataayaa ki qaraar par kaam karne ke liye banaai gai samiti agle do-teen maheene main kaam puraa kar legi
 When the Defense Minister was asked what would be the requirement of the rest, he said in an interview to PTI, "we are not buying the rest of the aircraft
" ham keval sidhe 36 vimaanon ko kharid rahe hai
 Parrikar said that the UPA deal to buy 126 Rafale aircraft was too expensive and it would have hampered other modernization plans of the Indian Army
 unhone kaha ki saude ke liye 10 se 11 saal kii avadhi main kareeb 1
 3 lakh crores was required
 unhone kaha, kya anya kisi kaam ke liye paisa rahata? raksha mantri ne kaha, mujhe bhi lagata he ki mere paas bmdablyoo or marsdes ho
 But i do not keep, because i cannot afford it
 pehali baat to main iskaa kharch nahin uthaa saktaa or duusari baat ki mujhe isaki jarurat nahin he
 Therefore 126 Rafale aircraft are economically impractical
 ye jaruri nahin hai
 During his visit to France last month, Prime Minister narendramodi announced the decision to purchase 36 Rafale aircraft with the status of flying under a government-to-government (G2G) agreement
 tippaniyan Parrikar questioned the tendering process initiated by former Defense Minister AK Antony and said that Antony put up hurdles in the tender process in such a way that the Rafael deal could never be implemented
 unhone congress kii is aalochana ko khaarij kar diya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne vitt mantralay or sainya pariyojnaon par nirnay lene vaali raksha mantralay kii sheersh ikai raksha kharid parishad kii avhelnaa kii
 Parrikar said that the deal has not been signed yet and he should wait till the process is over
 raksha mantri ne vishwaas jataayaa ki qaraar par kaam karne ke liye banaai gai samiti agle do-teen maheene main kaam puraa kar legi
 He said that around 1 to 10 to 11 years for the deal
 3 lakh karod rupee kii jarurat padati
 He said, would there be money for any other work? The Defense Minister said, i also think that i have BMW and Mercedes
 lekin main nahin rakhata, kyonki main iskaa kharch nahin uthaa saktaa
 Firstly i cannot afford it and secondly i do not need it
 isliye 126 rafel vimaan aarthik rup se avyaavhaarik hai
 These are not necessary
 pradhanmantri narendramodi ne pichley maheene apni france yatra ke dauraan sarkaar se sarkaar ke bich (ji2ji) qaraar ke tahat udaan bharne kii sthiti vaale 36 rafel vimaan kharidne ke faisle kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The comments parrikar ne purv raksha mantri eke antni dwaara shuru kii gai nivida prakriya par sawaal khadey kiye or kaha ki antni ne nivida prakriya main is tarah rode daale ki rafel sauda kabhi lagu nahin ho paata
 He dismissed the Congress criticism that Prime Minister Narendra Modi defied the Defense Procurement Council, the apex unit of the Ministry of Defense, which took decisions on finance and military projects
 parrikar ne kaha ki saude par abhi dastakhat hue nahin hai or unhen prakriya puri hone tak pratiksha kerani chahie
 The Defense Minister expressed confidence that the committee formed to work on the agreement will complete the work in the next two-three months

 The Akhilesh government has also started withdrawing serious cases like misdemeanor and dacoity after receiving a blow from the High Court in the withdrawal of cases against those accused of terrorist attacks
 taaja maamla eta ke kasganj kaa he jahaan par pradesh sarkaar ne jila prashasan ko duraachaar or dakaiti ke aarope main namjad sapa nagar adhyaksh vikram singh yadav ke khilaaf cese vaapasi ko lekar baqayda aadesh jari kar diye hai
 The case was filed in the previous SP government in 2006 on a court order
 us samay ye sapa netaa or jila panchayat sadsy the
 The trial is scheduled for January 9
 vahiin historishiter sapa netaa se khaufjada pidat kaa parivaar pichley ek saal se apana ghar se chhodkar nyaay kii ummid main bhatak rahaa hai
 In the country, teach a lesson to the misdemeanors and there is a voice to teach a hard lesson to the accused of such incidents
 lekin upi main akhilesh sarkaar apane party ke netaa ke khilaaf duraachaar ke aarope ko waapas lene kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 The case belongs to Kasganj in Etah district
 jahaan july do hajaar chah main kasganj ke dholana kshetra ke gadhi gaanv main rahane vaale chaman khan ne aarope lagaaya tha ki sapa netaa or us samay ke jila panchayat sadsy vikram singh yadav ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar unke saath lutpaat kii or unki patni ke saath balaatkaar bhi kiya
 However, at that time there was also the SP government in the state and the police had not filed a case due to the case being connected to the ruling party
 lekin baad main adaalat ke aadesh ke baad aaropee vikram singh yadav sahit 15 anya par police ne lutpaat or balaatkaar kaa mukadmaa darj kiya
 The Akhilesh government has now ordered to withdraw the case in favor of the main accused SP District President Vikram Singh and all others
 haalanki grih vibhaag ke aalaa adhikari ko isaki khabar nahin he
 Whereas in a letter sent by Special Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh, Rajendra Kumar to the District Magistrate of Kasganj, it has been said that the Government has decided to withdraw the said suit in public interest
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki rajyapal mahoday dwaara uparyukt vaad ke abhiyojan ko waapas lene hetu lok abhiyojak dwaara nyaayalay main prarthana patr prastut karne kii anumati pradaan kii gai he
 Ensure the required action and also make the government aware of the action taken
 sarkaar ke is nirdesh par jila magistrate kasganj ne eta ke jila shaskeey adhivaktaa yogendra kumaar ko nyaayalay main aavashyak kaarywahi karne ko kaha he
 The court has fixed the matter for hearing on 9 January 2014
 netaa ke dar se gharbaar chhod kar baahar rah rahe peedita ke gharavaale ab bhi dare hue hai
 Let us tell you that along with these serious case against District President Vikram Yadav, a total of fifteen cases are registered in Kotwali and the image of the SP leader accused in the area is not less than any mafia
 unke khauf kaa alam ye he ki peedit parivaar apane ghar par taala laga ke bhaag khadey hue hai
 People around the camera are not ready to speak anything against the SP leader, but behind the camera, they do not get tired of telling stories of SP leader Vikram Singh's hooliganism
 vahiin jab police adhikariyon se baat kerani chaahi to unhone baat karne se saafe manaa kar diya
 However, the accused SP leader did not come in front of the camera and described himself as a victim of politics
 akhilesh sarkaar apni party ke netaa par balaatkaar or dakaiti ke darj mukademe waapas lene ke faisle par vipakshi dalon ne jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa hai
 Former chief minister and BJP leader Kalyan Singh has strongly criticized the Akhilesh government
 vahiin congress netaa or kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma kaa kahana he ki akhilesh sarkaar ne koi pehla aisa mukadmaa waapas nahin liya he balki apane kaaryakartaaon par lage aise kai anya mukademe bhi waapas liye hai
 The controversy has arisen with the statement of BJP general secretary and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah
 mujffarnagar ke shamali main unhone ek sabha main kaha, "uttar pradesh khaastaur se pashchimi uttar pradesh main chunaav sammaan ke liye or apmaan ke badale ke liye he
 It will teach a lesson to those who have done injustice
 " Amit Shah did not stop here
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki centre main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke agle hi din upi kii 'mullah mulaayam' kii sarkaar gir jaaegi
 The Congress has complained against Amit Shah to the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne unke bhaashan kii sidi manga kar uski jaanch shuru kar di he
 The BJP has defended Shah's statement
 shah kaa bayaan aise vakt aayaa he, jab pichley ek hafte main loksabhaa chunaav kaa agenda vikaas or upie sarkaar ke pradarshan se hatakar sampradayikta banaam dharm nirpekshata ke mudde par jaataa dikh rahaa he
 It started with Congress President Sonia Gandhi meeting with the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, in which she appealed to Bukhari not to split the secular vote
 iske baad shuukravaar ko bukhari ne baqayada press conference kar musalamaanon se congress ko vot dene kii apil jari kii
 Meanwhile, in his election meetings of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi accused the UPA government of carrying out 'pink Revolution' by promoting meat exports and also raised the case of cow slaughter
 sawaal yah he ki uttar pradesh main abhi tak modi kii 'vikaas purush' kii chhavi pesh karne vaali bijepi ne hindutv se jude kattar muddon ko uthaanaa kyon shuru kar diya he? Significantly, Modi has not yet raised the issue of Ram Mandir, Article 370 or the Uniform Civil Code in any of his rally in Uttar Pradesh
 vah vikaas kii baat karte hai yaa phir samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or congress ke aapas main mili hone kii baat kahkar 'sabakaa' safaya karne kii apil karte hai
 Has the BJP started feeling that it cannot get the electoral success without playing the card of Hindutva in Uttar Pradesh affected by the riots like Muzaffarnagar, through which it wants to travel from Lucknow to Delhi
 duusari taraf, samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party, congress or rashtriya lok dal sabake nishane par narendra modi hai
 In these parties, Muslims are competing to take votes with them, that's why everyone wants to be seen fighting Modi
 inhen lagata he ki gujarat dangon or modi kii kathith sampradayik chhavi ko jitna zyada uchhaala jayega, muslim maton kaa utana hi adhik dhruvikaran unke paksh main hoga
 It is not a coincidence that the statement of Congress candidate from Saharanpur, Imran Masood, and Rahul Gandhi coming on stage with Masood's wife, to mock Modi
 bispi or espi donon hi partiyon ko muslim vot chahie, taaki ve jati ke apane base vot main inhen milakar jeetne kii sthiti main aa saken
 Samajwadi Party's 'my' means muslim-yadav vote, then bsp's muslim-dalit vote
 yah chhipi baat nahin he ki uttar pradesh main muslim matadaata ranneetik taur par matdaan karata he
 Its priority is to vote for the candidate who is in a position to defeat the BJP candidate
 jabaki bijepi kii koshish isi muslim dhruvikaran ke badale main hinduon kaa dhruvikaran apane paksh main karne kii hoti he
 BJP leaders say that in such Lok Sabha seats where Muslim voters are more than 40 percent, their candidate is more likely to win, because all other parties except him field Muslim candidates
 aise main vikaas kii baaten or daawey hawa hote dikh rahe hai
 All parties are seen coming on their agenda and this agenda is seen in polarization of hindu-muslim votes
 chunaav main isse bhale hi siyaasi dalon ko phayda ho, magar ye agenda samaaj par gahare jakhm chhod jaataa he or is baar bhi aisa hi hota dikh rahaa he
 After reports of lack of cash from many parts of the country, the central government has come to the fore
 vitt mantralay ke daawey ke mutabik yah cash sankat ek jatke main deshbhar ke atm se hui nikasi ke chalate paidaa hua he
 The Secretary of Economic Affairs said that in the last 15 days, there has been withdrawal of three times more notes than normal
 vahiin vitt mantralay ne kam se kam 5 rajyon main cash kii killat kii baat ko mana he mamata banerjee ne ise notebandi part tu qaraar dete hue do or rajyon kaa naam diya jahaan cash kii killat dekhi ja rahi he
 According to the government, where 20 thousand crore currency is normally consumed during a month, about 45 thousand crore rupees have been withdrawn in different ways during the first 12-13 days of April
 in aankadon ke baavjood kendra sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki uske paas paryaapt maatra main karency maujuud he or agle 2 se 3 dinon ke andar sthiti ko saamaanya kar liya jayega
 Read this: Are atms emptying out of fear of the Modi government's FRDI bill? In the midst of this cash crisis, the Central Government assured the press conference that there is no shortage of notes in the country
 sarkaar ke paas abhi kareeb 2 lakh karod rupee kaa bhandar he or pichley 10-15 dinon se 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai kii raftaar bhi badha di he
 At the same time, both Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Minister of State for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla claimed that the currency crisis will be resolved in 3 days
 vitt mantralay ne kaha ki april ke pehle do hafton ke dauraan apratyaashit cash nikasi khaastaur par andhrapradesh, telugana, karnataka, madhyapradesh or bihar main hui he or yahi rajya cash sankat se sabase zyada prabhavit hai
 Although West Bengal is not included in the names of the states given by the Finance Ministry, the Chief Minister came forward and reacted to this cash crisis that is flourishing in the country
 ise padhein: acha rahaa is saal monsoon to 2019 main BJP ke liye hogi voton kii barish!pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha ki isane notebandi ke dinon kii yaaden taaja kar di
 Taking recourse to the tweet, Mamta said that, "many states saw reports of ATM machines not having money
" bade note gaayab hai
 The days of demonetisation were remembered
 desh main kya vittiya apaat sthiti bani hui he?’’khaas baat he ki mamata ne apni jaankaree ke mutabik jin rajyon main cash sankat kii baat kahi usamen maharashtra or gujarat ko bhi shaamil kiya he
 With these names, there is a cash crisis in at least 7 states
 So @officeofrg , soot(pun intended!)-boot ki sarkar with ‘black’ money fleeced from Meghalayan State exchequer by rampant corruption? Instead of singing away our woes, you could have given a report card of your inefficient govt in Meghalaya! Your indifference mocks us! pic

 unhone kaha, 'aise aaropon par samaj nahin aata ki hansaa jaae yaa phir royaa jaae
 The people of BJP have become very desperate to see Rahul Gandhi
 ye log kya kaam karte hai? kya baithkar online shopping website par chizon ke daam check karte rahete hai

 punjab main bijepi kii sahyogi shiromani akali dal ke netaa sukhbir ne aaj tak se sidhi baat main kaha ki jahaan jo pogivit campaning karata hai, jeet unheen kii hoti he
 However, he also said that he cannot say anything about the ground situation of Bihar
 vivaadit bayanon par tippanee se inkarsukhbir ne bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke us bayaan par tippanee karne se manaa kar diya jisamen unhone kaha tha ki yadi bihar main bijepi haari to pakistan main pataakhe phootenge
 Also, he did not say anything against the statement against Shahrukh
 sirf itnaa hi bole ki bihar kii jamini hakeekat nahin jaanata
 When asked how much of Bihar's defeat in Punjab will be, what will be the impact of bjp's defeat in Punjab, Sukhbir said - The situation in Punjab is completely different
 hamane pehle bhi vikaas ke mudde par hi chunaav jite hai
 We have developed road, electricity is surplus
 gaanv 4ji se jude hai
 Investments of millions have come
 hamaara agenda vikaas he
 When the opposition is scattered in Punjab, Sukhbir said that the opposition is already scattered in Punjab, when asked that the opposition in Punjab is also united against the BJP like Bihar
 gauratlab he ki congress daawa kar rahi he ki bihar main sabhi vipakshi dal ekajute hue or ab punjab main aisa hi hoga
 Punjab elections are due in 2017
 punjab ke khilaaf bahari takaton kii sajishkanoon vyavastha bekaabu hone ke sawaal par sukhbir bole- kuch bahari takatein punjab ko asthir kar rahi hai
 This is an international conspiracy
 ab congress isamen shaamil ho gai he
 He said that Simranjit Singh Maan proclaims Khalistan and the Congress remains present on that platform
 yahsikhon ko baantne kii sajishahai
 In response to this question, the main opposition in Punjab, Sukhbir said that both AAP and Congress are fighting for second and third numbers here
 punjab main aap kaa cheharaa bhagwant maan hai
 He remains drunk from morning to evening
 jahaan tak captain amarinder singh kaa sawaal he to wo do baar nock out (haar) ho chuke hai
 Country needs culture of Punjab Sukhbir said that there has never been any communal violence in Punjab
 yahaan tak ki militansi ke daur main or 1984 ke dangon main bhi sampradayik hinsa nahin hui
 Because in Punjab we celebrate every religion
 ye punjab kaa culture he
 This culture needs the whole country

 Congress leader Rajiv Shukla made it clear that the news published in the English newspaper is completely baseless and the government is firm on the press release of the Finance Ministry
 akhbaar ne chapa he ki vitt mantralay se jari press relies main deal ke samay ko chah maheene pehle kaa bataaya gaya jisase chidambaram ko bachaaya ja sake
 Here, the BJP surrounded the government on this issue and demanded that the government should tell to whom the shares of this company were transferred within this six months

 jammu-kashmir ko lekar modi sarkaar ne ab tak kaa sabase bada faisla le liya he
 Section 370 has been weakened and at the same time Jammu and Kashmir has now been made a union territory
 is bich ab centre sarkaar ne puri tarah se ghati par focus karnaa shuru kar diya he
 If sources are to be believed, the Modi government is going to announce several big schemes in the state soon, so that development can be taken forward in the state
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki centre sarkaar jald hi jammu-kashmir ke liye nae tareeke se vikaas kaa khaakaa khinchne kaa kaam karegi

 During his address to the Rajya Sabha, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said that Section 370 in the Valley had stunted the development, neither the people there could get the benefit of any Central scheme nor did they get employment opportunities

 The Karni Sena is a social organization, the rest are political organizations
 ' kalvi ne bijepi par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki gajendra singh shekhavat kii galati yah thi ki vah rajput hai

 gauratlab he ki is tarah kii khabaren ai thim ki jodhpur se saansad or centre main mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ko bijepi rajasthan main pradesh adhyaksh bana sakati he
 However, the post was later given to Madan Lal Saini

 77-year-old Sudha Shivpuri had been ailing for almost a year and a half (since December 2013), and died in a hospital in Mumbai on Wednesday morning
 tippaniyan Sudha Shivpuri was the wife of Hindi cinema's famous character actor Om Shivpuri, and Sudha made her debut as a character artist in films in the year 1977 with Basu Chatterjee's film 'swami'

 He acted in films like 'insaaf Ka Tarazu', 'hamari Bahu Alka', 'sawan Ko Aane Do', 'the Burning Train', 'vidhata' and 'maya Memsahab', but was a success, coming to TV after
 sudhaa shivpuri ne 'aa bail mujhe maar', 'rajani', 'rishte', 'sarahadein', 'bandhan' jaise dharawahikon main mahatvapurn bhoomikaayen nibhaain, lekin aaj bhi log unhen 'kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi' kii 'ba' ke rup main sabase zyaada yaad karte hai

 Ritu, the daughter of Sudha and Om Shivpuri, also tried her luck in Hindi films, and made her debut as Govinda's 'aankhen' in 1993, but she did not achieve much success
 unhone 'insaaf kaa taraazuu', 'hamaari bahu alka', 'sawan ko aane do', 'da burning train', 'vidhaataa' or 'maaya memsahab' jaisi filmon main kaam kiya, lekin unhen safalataa hasil hui, tivi par aane ke baad

 lambey samay se chali aa rahi charchaaon par viraam lagaate hue rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne apane ganavesh main bade badlaav kaa elaan kar diya
 It was decided at the meeting of the All India House of Representatives in Nagaur that instead of khaki half pants, brown trousers (full pants) were being included in the official uniform of the union
 lekin iske saath hi yah dilchaspee bad gai ki sangh ne khaaki kii jagah 'brown' rang ko hi kyon chunaa, jabaki iske liye navy blue yaa blike kii bhi charchaa joro par thi
 After the statement issued by the Union, the color of trousers was seen to be confused with wooden brown or coffee brown
 brown rang ke kai shades hote hai
 After so much cleaning, the volunteers of the Sangh had no dilemma about it
 badlaav par pehali charchaa marathi mensang ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki is vishay main lambey samay se sangh kii aantarik baithkon main charchaa hoti rahi he
 The Sangh has always accepted the change at the right time
 mukhyalay nagpur hone se is vishya par marathi main hi charchaa kii shuruyaat swaabhaavik he, lekin hamane rang ko lekar hameshaa spasht rukh rakhaa
 The color of the pants was thought to be clay color instead of khaki
 ise hamane hindi main bolkar samajhane kii koshish kii
 Later it was popularized in English as Wooden or Coffee Brown
 mitti se lagaav he rang chunane kii vajahmatmaile rang kii prishthbhumi bataate hue adhikari ne bataaya ki sangh kii shakha maidaanon main lagati he or swayamsevak mitti par hi khelte or iske geet gaate hai
 The reason for choosing the beige color is the attachment of all of us to the soil, nothing else
 is par hamaare saare adhikari auraswayamsevakekamat ho gaye
 After this, the color itself was fixed
 samay-samay par badlaav karata rahaa he sanghasangh ke sarkaryavahsuresh bhaiyaji joshine bataaya tha ki ab rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii nai dress main khaaki half pant kii jagah bhure rang kii phul pant ko jagah di gai he
 Regarding color, he said that there is no reason behind choosing it
 saath hi yah bhi kaha ki keval half pant hi sangh kii pahchaan nahin he
 This major change has occurred in the 91-year history of the Sangh
 iske pehle sangh ne apane juute or belt ko bhi badla
 The Sangh has approved changes from time to time on its daily exercise and intellectual matters on its branch
 91 saal se khaaki half pant rahi pahchansaal 1925 main sangh kii sthapana ke baad se dhilaa-dhalakhki half pantsanghathan kii pahchaan rahaa he
 Initially, the uniforms of the Union used to have khaki shirts and half pants until 1940 and later the white shirt was added to it
 sangh kii ore se is bare main kaha gaya ki aaj ke saamaajik jivan main phul pant niyamit rup se shaamil he or isi ko dekhte hue faisla kiya gaya
 The Sangh said, 'we decided on the brown color, which has no particular reason but it is available comfortably and looks good

 "got answer," "across 75"
 unhone na main sir hilaayaa or muskaraate hue kaha, ''sara kaa sara 90 hamaara
 "nadda's interaction with 10,000 booth workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana is in fact part of that strategy of the party's national president and home minister Amit Shah
" ise modi-2 sarkaar banane ke baad hone vaale pehle vidhansabha chunaav main party ko sahi sabit karnaa he: arthath vidhansabha kii sabhi siten jeetne kaa lakshya
 If the BJP succeeds in doing so, it will probably be the first party in the country to hold the title
 haryana ke bhaajapa prabharee or mahasachiv anil jain kehete hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa rajya kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa seat jeetne main safal rahi he
 Not only this, in these elections, BJP was leading in 79 out of 90 assembly seats
 aise main koi bhi lakshya kathin nahin he
 "at the same time, the state president of the party Subhash Barala says," The entire party is trying to increase the lead to 79 seats to 90 seats and we will be successful in it
 " '' lekin vidhansabha kii jin 11 siton par bhaajapa badhat nahin le saki, unke siyaasi sameekaran bhaajapa ke liye badi chunauti hai
 In fact, where Rohtak and Sonepat are jat-muslim decisive voters, it is not easy for the BJP to make a dent in this vote bank
 khaskar tab jab bhaajapa, jat banaam anya kii ranneeti par chal rahi he
 However, a senior party general secretary says, "BJP has received votes from all the communities
 agar aisa nahin hota to phir party sabhi das loksabhaa siten nahin jitati

 BJP sources say that apart from former Chief Minister Bansi Lal's granddaughter Shruti Chaudhary and daughter-in-law Kiran Chaudhary, Dipendra Singh Hooda is in touch with the party
 is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki kuch netaa bhaajapa main shaamil honge

 "it is not surprising if non-bjp parties do not win any seats in Haryana," says a senior party leader
 isaki vajahen saaf hai
 Firstly, the non-jat vote of the BJP is united
 duusari baat ki rohtak or sonipat jaise kuch ilaako main jat vot congress or jejepi ke bich banta hua he
 Thirdly, the organization of both the main opposition Congress and JJP is weak and there is a fierce internal conflict regarding leadership

 In February 2016, there was a Jat agitation in the state and the property of non-jat people was severely damaged

 This means that the Jats are cutting from the BJP
 khaskar, bhaajapa pichley paanch saal se jis tarah se gaiyr-jat samudaay par puraa focus kar rahi he, usase jat bhaajapa se naaraaz hai
 The displeasure of the Jat community is that in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP did not get the lead even on the seats on which two BJP ministers Capt Abhimanyu (from Narnaud) and Omprakash Dhankar (from Badli) were elected in the last assembly election
 donon jat samudaay se hai, iske baad bhi bhaajapa in siton par badhat nahin le saki

 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar isse inkaar karte hai, ''congress apane dam par chunaav ladegi or bhaajapa ko haraayegi

 Both major opposition parties have not been able to correct their internal affairs

 agar shivasena yuva morcha ke adhyaksh aditya thakare kii chali to mayanagari mumbai kii nitalife phir se josh or raunak se bhar jaaegi
 In this regard, Shiv Sena-ruled BMC passed a resolution and sent it for final approval of the state government
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki ye prastaav bhagava dakshinpanthi party shivasena kii ore se aayaa he
 This is the same party known for its conservative thinking in Mumbai
 yah dal hameshaa se mumbai main rev partiyon or der raat hone vaali isi tarah kii anya gatividhiyon ke khilaaf rahaa he
 Now Shiv Sena wants Mumbai's cafes and restaurants to be open 24 hours
 party kaa maananaa he ki isse shahar ko international luk milegaa
 Shiv Sena's Yuva Morcha Yuva Sena president Aditya Thackeray said, "I understand that Mumbai is in dire need of safe and attractive nightlife
" bahut se log kaam ke baad fursat ke palon ko bitaana chaahate hai
 In New York, London and even Indore, 24-hour cafes and restaurants are open, so why not in Mumbai? However, it is believed that this is an exercise to woo the young voters of Shiv Sena
 kya he prastaav memprastaav ke mutabik shahar ke kuch hisse 24 / 7 jone honge
 Not only the tourists but also the professionals working in the night shift will be able to eat in the restaurants located in these zones
 maujuuda niyam ke anusaar mumbai main restaurant raat 12 baje tak or pub raat 1 baje tak hi khul sakate hai
 In the first phase, along with restaurants or food shops, the pharmacy and dairy will be open all night
 haalanki prastaav main baar or pub ke raatbhar khulne kii baat nahin kii gai he
 Permit will be given only for non-residential areas
 or iske liye ilaake ke logon kii rajamandi bhi jaruri hogi
 The same idea would later be adopted in Thane, Pune and Nashik
 ensipi ne bhi is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya he
 But at the same time it has sharply criticized the Shiv Sena's double attitude

 kitaab: namo vaanividha- vichaar sangrahalekhak- arun anandprakashak- prabhaat prakashanmoolya- 125 rupee(paper back)aaj kii taarikh main har kisi kii jubaan par bijepi ke piem in vatting narendra modi kaa naam he
 To capitalize on this popularity of Modi, many books are also being launched in the market
 aisi hi ek koshish he, 'namo vaani'
 It is clear from the name that only Modi in this book
 
 
 modi
 
 
 It is Modi and Modi
 kitaab narendra modi ke vaktavyon, tippaniyon or bhaashanon kaa sankalan he, vistrut to nahin par sankshipt hi sahi
 In this book, a simple attempt has been made to introduce the readers to the intellectual side of Modi
 aakhir modi mantra he kya? wo koun sa agenda he jiske dam par modi achche din aane kaa daawa karte hai
 What is Modi's view on secularism, nationalism, development and other important issues? You will get answers to all these questions in one place
 kitaab main modi ke jin vichaaron kaa zikr he, usase saaf he ki lekhak ne alag-alag bhaashanon ke ahm hisson ko chunakar ise vichaar sangrah kaa rup de diya he
 If you are a Modi supporter then most of the things written in this book are old for you
 yun to modi ke vichaar paramparaagat or soshal media main charchaa kaa centre hote hai
 There are long debates about his speeches, so the excesses written in the book will seem old to you
 rochak vichaar'kadi mehnat kabhi thakaan nahin laati, vah santosh laati he', modi ke is anomal vachan ko unke chunaav prachaar ke saath jodakar dekhie to iskaa bhavarth zyada praasangik najar aata he
 'there is no full stop in politics', these words of Modi tell the reality of politics
 'kashmir se kanyakumari tak bharat nek rahe, ek rahe', kuch aise hi or bhi rochak vichaar aapke padhane ke anubhav ko mjedaar banaate hai
 What's special, the three parts of the last part of the book in the book are very funny
 'kahin ham unako bhul na jaaen' section main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude nami chehron ke bare main modi kya sochate hai, iskaa ullekh he
 In fact, Modi wrote about these leaders in his book 'jyotipunj', some of which is taken in 'namo Vani'
 modi ne dow
 Keshavrao Baliram has shared his experience about Hedgewar to Laxman Rao Inam (lawyer sir)
 'kavitanjali' section main modi dwaara likhi gai kavitaaon ko liya gaya he or aakhir main sabase lokapriy modi ke bol, 'anmol vachan' naam ke section main rakhaa gaya he
 Why buy this book? You will often find yourself stuck between a pro and anti-modi camp at the street intersection in the election season
 aise main aap is kitaab kaa zikr kar ek paale ke saath to ho hi sakate hai
 However, if the discussion becomes more serious, then avoid mentioning the things written in this book
 kyon na khariden?adhuraa gyaan agyaan se zyada khatarnaak hota he
 The biography of Modi mentioned in 'namo Vani' is nothing more than Mahima Mandan
 ab modi ne bhi yah saaf kar diya he ki unki shaadi hui thi par is kitaab main modi ke brahmacharee hone kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 At the same time, a mere 191-page book to understand the brand Modi is insufficient to throw light on all aspects
 agar 9 pannon main modi kii puri jeevani kaa varnan kar diya gaya ho to aap anumaan laga sakate hai ki is kitaab ko padhane ke baad bhi aap adhuraa sa mahasoos karenge
 In Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, unscrupulous miscreants shot dead a wood trader in broad daylight

 dimonetigeshan ke baad cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke liye BHIM ap launch kiya gaya jise mobile yugers teji se apana rahe hai
 This app is better than Paytm and other e-wallets in many ways
 BHIM ke baad ab electronic tranjaction ko pehle se aasaan banane ke liye QR code laane kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 Significantly, in China, the QR there is the most used for electronic payment
 isi tarj par bharat main bhi QR code yani quick rispons code ko 20 farvari ko launch kiya jayega
 According to a Times of India report, the Indian Banks Association held a meeting of all banks in which options for retail payment through QR code were discussed and its launch was finalized
 QR code debit card ke liye kaaman interphes kaa kaam karegaa
 These cards will include Visa, mastercard and rupay
 iske alaava aadhaar card ke jariye kiye jane vaale pements or transfer bhi QR code ke jariye kiye ja sakenge
 Through indiaqr, payments can also be made through the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) platform
 haalanki bankers ne kaha he ki shuruaati daur main indiaqr se vija, master card or rupay ko saport karenge
 Having trouble understanding the QR Code, then tell you that Paytm already uses QR to take payment
 aisa hi bhim ap main bhi he
 But they have limits
 yani ye code wo log hi yuj kar sakate hai jinke paas petm acount hai
 But indiaqr can use all those who have debit cards
 ye honge indiaqr ke phaayde- indiaqr launch hone ke baad koi bhi shaks jiske paas smartphone aurabank acount he wo QR kodeke jariye pement kar sakegaa
 However, banks will have to enter into agreements with merchants for this
 - petm kii tarah kisi bhi marchents ke yahaan aap QR Code scan karke pement de sakenge
 - You can get rid of swiping debit card
 - time kii bhi hogi bachat

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's 'bhaag Bhago, Desh Bachao' rally at Patna's Gandhi Maidan is being considered a success
 modi-nitish ke khilaaf lalu raily main 17 vipakshi dalon ko ekajute karne main safal rahe, lekin bispi supremeo mayawati isamen shaamil nahin huin
 Experts believe that with this step of Maya, not only Lalu but Maya too may have to suffer political losses
 lalu ke liye maaya kyon jarurimahagathbandhan se naata tod nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke sang haath mila liya he
 In such a situation, Lalu needs a strong base partner in the politics of Bihar, with the help of his shoulder strength, he can compete with modi-nitish
 isi ke maddenjar unhone bihar kii sarajameen par vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ko ekajute kiya, lekin antim vakt main mayawati ne isamen shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya
 Only Mayawati could overcome Nitish's lack of a grand alliance
 bihar main dalit matadaataaon kii sankhya kareeb 20 fisadi he, to vahiin yadavon ke vot kareeb 14 fisadi hai
 If the two leaders had come together, the combined vote share would have gone up to 34 percent
 iske alaava bihar main musalamaanon kii aabaadi bhi kareeb 17 fasadi he, jo philhal lalu ke saath najar aati he
 By bringing the Dalits closer through Lalu Yadav Mayawati, Yadav can make a strong fight against modi-nitish by creating a strong equation between Muslims and Dalits
 itnaa hi nahin loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or congress ke baad bispi desh kii teesri sabase badi party thi, jise 4
 1 percent votes were received
 ye baat alag he ki wo in voton kii kisi seat main tabdeel nahin kar pai or uskaa score 00 rahaa
 The BSP in Bihar is not much interfered with in the politics of Grafbahar
 bispi ke pichley chunaav main aae nateezon se ye saaf samajha ja saktaa he
 The BSP contested 225 seats in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections and got 2
 07 fisadi vot mili
 In this sense, it was the seventh party of the state
 2010 main bispi 239 siton par ladi or teen siton par iske ummidavaar duusare number par rahe
 3 in this election to BSP
 21 fisadi vot mili or is lihaaj se vah chhathi sabase badi party thi
 In the 2005 assembly elections, the BSP fought for 238 seats and won two seats
 vahiin 2000 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bispi avibhajit bihar kii 324 main se 249 siton par chunaav ladi or paanch siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 In the politics of the current phase of how much work for Maya, Lalu needs not only Mayawati, but Maya also needs a strong base to preserve her existence
 bispi kaa majboot aadhaar uttar pradesh hi rahaa he, lekin 2007 ke baad se lagaataar uskaa graph girtaa ja rahaa he
 In the general elections 2014, not a single BSP MP could win and in the 2017 assembly elections, only 19 BSP mlas managed to win
 upi ke saath desh bhar main bhi bispi kaa aadhaar kamjor hua he
 Recently Mayawati has also resigned from Rajya Sabha
 jabaki maujuuda samay main vah is sthiti main bhi nahin hai ki akele dam par rajyasabha yaa vidhaan parishad main pahunch saken
 At such a time, Lalu has openly spoken about sending Mayawati from Bihar to Rajya Sabha
 maaya-akhilesh kii jodi ke minemayawati ke liye apane khiskate janaadhar ko bachaae rakhane ke liye majboot aadhaar vaale saathi kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, if she were on Lalu's platform on August 27, her name would have been included in the opposition's solidarity
 patna main akhilesh or mayawati ek manch par hote to phir 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main upi main ek alag tasviir dikhaai detii
 The BSP currently holds 22 percent of the vote, while the SP has 21
 8 fisadi
 In this case, the combined vote of both reaches around 44 percent
 is majboot aadhaar ke sahare modi se unka muqabla karnaa aasaan hota
 Akhilesh Yadav has spoken openly about his alliance with the BSP many times
 aise main ab mayawati ko faisla lenaa he ki wo akele hi siyaasi jang main utrengi yaa phir vipakshi kii ekajutata ke saath khadi hongi
 Why Lalu did not attend the rally, Mayawatimayavati wanted to clarify the stance on seat sharing before joining the grand alliance rally
 wo chaahati thim ki ye baat saaf ho jaae ki kis dal ko kitni siten milengi or sabhi ke bich talmail kii sahmati ban jaae
 Maya also said that she does not want to take any step in haste
 is tarah ke morche main shaamil hokar yaa raily main hissaa banakar tab tak koi laabh nahin hone vaala jab tak siton ke talmail par koi sahmati na ban jaae
