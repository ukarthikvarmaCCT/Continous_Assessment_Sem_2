isliye khud ghoshnaa se bachati raheen
 On whatsapp, messages started circulating without a name that there is a change of power in Gujarat
 virodhiyon ne kabhi khandan nahin kiya
 Rupani is considered to be the Amit Shah camp, so not to deny it is to air it in a way
 isliye somvaar ko anandiben narendra modi se milane gayi sookhe par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel, Health Minister of Gujarat, went to Delhi to discuss the issue of NEET exam
 nitin patel amit shah se bhi mili
 Amit Shah's close friends added this and sparked discussion that Nitin Patel could become the new chief minister
 tippaniyan Everyone is saying that Amit Shah no longer wants to become the Shah of Gujarat
 baat ye rakhi jaati he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke aage 10 mukhyamantri line lagaate hai, aakhir amit shah mukhyamantri kyon bananaa chahenge
 But no one has the answer to why Amit Shah wants to remain a minor MLA of Gujarat
 jabaki wo vidhansabha main bhi maujuud nahin rahete
 Only one day comes in the budget session for the whole year
 vajah saaf he, amit shah ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke icchhuk hai
 All these discussions have been put to rest by Anandiben himself
 lekin anandiben se pehle narendra modi ne khud unke kaam kaa bakhaan karte hue twit karke ye jaahir kar diya he ki wo ab bhi modi kii bharosemand hai
 In such a situation, the opposition in BJP will continue against Anandiben, but he is finding it difficult to do harm
 haa, lekin 2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Winning in Gujarat is also important for Modi
 isliye vivaad chalate rahen to party ke parformens par asar pads saktaa he
 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he
 The discussion about the removal of Anandiben Patel has not arisen for the first time
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi jab desh ke pradhanmantri bane tabhi se gujarat main unke naiysargik uttaradhikari ke taur par unke chahete amit shah ko dekha ja rahaa tha
 Most people in the Gujarat BJP believed that Amit Shah would take over the throne of Gujarat after Modi
 lekin narendra modi ye nahin chaahate the or wo amit shah ko hataa bhi nahin sakate the, aakhir amit shah hameshaa se hi narendra modi ke sabase kareebi logon main se rahe hai
 Also, among the most trusted allies of Narendra Modi, besides Amit Shah, was Anandiben Patel
 lekin maze kii baat thi ki amit shah or anandiben ke bich kabhi nahin bani
 Both were always in danger from each other
 isliye donon ko narendra modi ko sanbhaalanaa tha
 So Anandiben sat on the throne of Gujarat and Amit Shah was told to be active in national politics and also assured that he would be the new national president of the party
 baahar sabakuch thik dikhe isliye anandiben ke naam kaa prastaav bhi karavaaya amit shah se
 Modi shot two birds with one stone
 amit shah naaraazgi ke baavjood maan gayi, sanket achche gayi or amit shah ke gujarat se dur rahane kii vajah se anandiben kii mushkilen kam raheen
 But not only Amit Shah, most of the people in the party were angry with Anandiben
 anandiben swabhaav se thodi bebaak hai, kisi kii baat janchi nahin to rajnatik nahin ekadam bold jawaab de detii hai
 Therefore, ever since Anandiben became the Chief Minister, there was discontent against him in the BJP but Narendra Modi was the choice, so no one dared to openly oppose him
 isliye sabase pehle unke khilaaf campan kiya gaya ki wo budhi ho gai hai or unhen cancer ho gaya
 Nobody discussed it openly, but whenever there were hidden things, it started being discussed
 baat yahaan tak bad gai ki swasthya kii vajah se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Anandiben, since it was not an open discussion, never talked about it
 lekin wo din main 15-16 ghante kaam karti raheen
 The answer was simple, can a sick man do so much work
 tab dinesh sharma gujarat ke prabharee the
 Despite all the discussion reached here that Dinesh Sharma had to say that the talk of changing Anandiben is meaningless and she is doing a great job
 virodhiyon ke munh kuch dinon ke liye chup ho gayi
 But then in August last year, the Patidar movement started
 prachaar aisa kiya gaya ki anandiben patidaaron se samaadhaan nahin chaahatin isliye wo andolan chalane nahin de rahi hai
 a day before the big Patidar rally, Anandiben made it clear by giving advertisements in newspapers that it was not possible to give them reservation according to the constitution
 usee saal disambar main sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main virodhiyon ko ummid thi ki anandiben buree tarah haar sakati hai
 The BJP lost but completely dominated the cities in its stronghold, only in rural areas
 virodhiyon ko phir mauka nahin mila
 But there have been some incidents in the last few days which again aired this discussion
 sabase pehle 29 april ko bhaajapa ke adhyaksh amit shah gujarat aaye
 Shah, Anandiben and state president Vijay Rupani met at BJP headquarters
 meeting ke baad roopaani ne press conference karke 10 pratishat aarthik savarna pichhadon ke liye aarakshan kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anandiben Patel sat next
 haalanki ye faisla sarkari hona chahie tha lekin roopaani kii ghoshnaa ke baad laga ki power shift ho rahaa he
 But the point was that Anandiben Patel still did not agree with this decision, but there was no scope of protest after Narendra Modi's green signal
 isliye khud ghoshnaa se bachati raheen
 On whatsapp, messages started circulating without a name that there is a change of power in Gujarat

 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he
 Therefore, the first campaign against her was that she had become old and had cancer
 iske bare main kisi ne khule taur par charchaa nahin kii lekin jab bhi chuphi baaten hoti thim to isaki charchaa hone lagi
 It has even increased that they can be removed due to health
 anandiben ne chunki ye khuli charchaa nahin thi, kabhi is par baat nahin kii
 But she kept working for 15-16 hours a day
 jawaab saaf tha, kya koi biimaar aadmi itnaa kaam kar saktaa he
 Dinesh Sharma was then in charge of Gujarat
 sabhi ke baavjood charchaa yahaan tak pahunchi ki dinesh sharma ko kahana padaa ki anandiben ko badalane kii baaten nirarthak hai or wo bahut acha kaam kar rahi hai
 Opponents' faces fell silent for a few days
 lekin phir pichley saal agast main patidaar andolan shuru hua
 The propaganda was done that Anandiben does not want a solution from the Patidars, so she is not letting the movement go
 patidaaron kii badi raily ke ek din pehle hi anandiben ne akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar saaf kar diya ki unhen aarakshan dena samvidhan ke mutabik sambhav nahin
 In December of the same year, in the election of local bodies, the opponents were hopeful that Anandiben could be defeated badly
 bhaajapa haari lekin sirf gramin ilaakon main, apane garh main shaharon main puri tarah haaavee raheen
 Opponents did not get a chance again
 lekin pichley kuch dinon main kuch ghatnaayen huin jisane phir is charchaa ko hawa di
 BJP President Amit Shah first came to Gujarat on 29 April
 shah, anandiben or pradesh adhyaksh vijay roopaani kii baithak hui bhaajapa mukhyalay main
 After the meeting, Rupani announced a reservation for 10 percent economic upper castes at a press conference
 anandiben patel bagal main baithi
 Although this decision should have been official, but after Rupani's announcement, the power shift was happening
 lekin baat ye thi ki anandiben patel ab bhi is faisle se sahamat nahin thim, lekin narendra modi ke green signal ke baad virodh kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 So she kept herself from the announcement
 whatsap par bina naam ke massej ghoomane lage ki gujarat main satta parivartan ho rahaa he
 Opponents never denied
 roopaani amit shah kheme ke maane jate hai to iskaa khandan na karnaa ek tarah se ise hawa dena hi he
 So on Monday, Anandiben went to meet Narendra Modi to discuss the drought
 nitin patel, gujarat ke swasthya mantri, dilli gayi neet pariksha ke mudde par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel also met Amit Shah
 amit shah ke karibiyon ne ise jod diya or charchaa ched di ki nitin patel naye mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 The comments sabhi kah rahe hai ki amit shah ab gujarat ke shah nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 It is kept that 10 Chief Ministers line up in front of National President, why would Amit Shah want to become Chief Minister
 lekin iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he ki aakhir amit shah kyon gujarat ke maamuli vidhayak bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 While they are not present in the assembly also
 puure saal sirf bajet seshan main ek din hi aa pate hai
 The reason is simple, Amit Shah is still keen on becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 in sab charchaaon ko haalanki anandiben ne khud viraam diya he
 But before Anandiben, Narendra Modi himself has made it clear by tweeting his work that he is still trusted by Modi
 aise main bhaajapa main virodh chalata rahegaa anandiben ke khilaaf lekin unhen nuksaan kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Yes, but Gujarat has assembly elections in 2017
 gujarat main jeetna modi ke liye bhi ahm he
 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time
 tab dinesh sharma gujarat ke prabharee the

 roopaani amit shah kheme ke maane jate hai to iskaa khandan na karnaa ek tarah se ise hawa dena hi he
 So on Monday, Anandiben went to meet Narendra Modi to discuss the drought
 nitin patel, gujarat ke swasthya mantri, dilli gayi neet pariksha ke mudde par charchaa ke liye
 Nitin Patel also met Amit Shah
 amit shah ke karibiyon ne ise jod diya or charchaa ched di ki nitin patel naye mukhyamantri ban sakate hai
 The comments sabhi kah rahe hai ki amit shah ab gujarat ke shah nahin bananaa chaahate hai
 It is kept that 10 Chief Ministers line up in front of National President, why would Amit Shah want to become Chief Minister
 lekin iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he ki aakhir amit shah kyon gujarat ke maamuli vidhayak bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 While they are not present in the assembly also
 puure saal sirf bajet seshan main ek din hi aa pate hai
 The reason is simple, Amit Shah is still keen on becoming the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 in sab charchaaon ko haalanki anandiben ne khud viraam diya he
 But before Anandiben, Narendra Modi himself has made it clear by tweeting his work that he is still trusted by Modi
 aise main bhaajapa main virodh chalata rahegaa anandiben ke khilaaf lekin unhen nuksaan kar paanaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Yes, but Gujarat has assembly elections in 2017
 gujarat main jeetna modi ke liye bhi ahm he
 Therefore, if the controversy continues, the performance of the party can be affected
 isliye shaayad modi khud anandiben ko chunaavon se pehle ek gauravpurn vidaay den, governor banaakar
 But it still has time
 lekin baat ye thi ki anandiben patel ab bhi is faisle se sahamat nahin thim, lekin narendra modi ke green signal ke baad virodh kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 So she kept herself from the announcement

 Nitin Patel, Health Minister of Gujarat, went to Delhi to discuss the issue of NEET exam
 nitin patel amit shah se bhi mili
 Amit Shah's close friends added this and sparked discussion that Nitin Patel could become the new chief minister
 tippaniyan Everyone is saying that Amit Shah no longer wants to become the Shah of Gujarat
 baat ye rakhi jaati he ki rashtriya adhyaksh ke aage 10 mukhyamantri line lagaate hai, aakhir amit shah mukhyamantri kyon bananaa chahenge
 But no one has the answer to why Amit Shah wants to remain a minor MLA of Gujarat
 jabaki wo vidhansabha main bhi maujuud nahin rahete
 Only one day comes in the budget session for the whole year
 vajah saaf he, amit shah ab bhi gujarat ke mukhyamantri banane ke icchhuk hai
 All these discussions have been put to rest by Anandiben himself
 lekin anandiben se pehle narendra modi ne khud unke kaam kaa bakhaan karte hue twit karke ye jaahir kar diya he ki wo ab bhi modi kii bharosemand hai
 In such a situation, the opposition in BJP will continue against Anandiben, but he is finding it difficult to do harm
 haa, lekin 2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Winning in Gujarat is also important for Modi
 isliye vivaad chalate rahen to party ke parformens par asar pads saktaa he
 So maybe Modi himself gives Anandiben a proud speech before the elections, by making him the governor
 lekin usamen abhi vakt he

 like
 
 
 1
 In the fodder scam, the record of his success in convicting CBI accused on the basis of evidence, there is little chance of Lalu Yadav and other accused being relieved or said innocent on that basis
 aise main unka doshi qaraar diya jane kii prabal sambhaavna he
 2
 agar lalu yadav baaki ke chaar maamlo main doshi qaraar die gaye tab chunaav ladane kii sambhaavna na ke baraabar hai
 Once sentenced, you are disqualified for 5 years
 aise main paanch maamlo main pachis saal tak unhen chunavi raajnneeti se dur rahanaa padegaa
 Unless the Jharkhand High Court or the Supreme Court quash the case against him
 3
 Lalu Yadav will have to go to jail every time he is convicted
 or unke party ke log bhi maanate hai kii somvaar ke sarvocch nyaayalay ke jatke ke baad unhen chaar baar jail janaa pad saktaa he
 4
 chaara ghotaale ke maamle main doshi, sajaa yaa jail jane par nitish kumaar or congress party se unke sambandhon par koi pratikul asar nahin padegaa kyonki donon ne dosti or rajintik gathbandhan chaara ghotaale main ek maamle main doshi paae jane ke babajood kiya tha
 5
 lalu yadav kii asal mushkil chaara ghotaale se zyada bijepi netaa sushil modi hai jo har duusare din unke sampatti ke nae nae khulaase ko lekar hai
 Because Lalu Yadav also knows that the way assets have been acquired, they may face a lot of difficulty in getting the agreement right in public or in front of any investigating agency
 6
 Lalu Yadav knows that if his son is caught in the property game then it is useless to expect Rahim from Nitish as the only accumulated capital of the Chief Minister of Bihar is his own image and that he can lose to Tejapratap and Tejashwi in an attempt to save him
 Will not make a mistake 7
 Lalu Yadav also knows that even if the hearing in all the cases is not completed in the given time period of 9 months of Supreme Court, now these cases will not be dragged for a long time and presently CBI officials will try to get all the cases as soon as possible
 Let me decide
 8
 At present, Lalu Yadav's bail may not be canceled but the next time he goes to jail, it is useless to expect bail if he does not spend 50 percent of his time in jail
 tippaniyan 9
 lalu yadav kaa prayaas hoga ki sampatti ki bare main bijepi dwaara ho rahe khulaase par centre kii jaanch se pehle sab kuch durust kar liya jaae
 He knows that Tej Pratap and Tejashwi Yadav have increased the problems of the government and especially Nitish Kumar by not giving most of the information in his affidavit
 10
 The investigation into the fodder scam which has been affecting Lalu Yadav's politics and personal life for the last 21 years and which led to him being jailed for more than half a dozen times does not end his chase at all and he will be kept in this affair for many years to come
 There will be rounds of courts and jail

 If Lalu Yadav is convicted in the remaining four cases, then the chances of contesting elections are slim
 ek baar sajaa hone par 5 saal ke liye aapako ayogy qaraar diya jaataa he
 In such a case, for five years in five cases, he will have to stay away from electoral politics

 The Home Ministry report said that this case is related to the brutal murder of a former prime minister from the country, who was killed by a foreign terrorist organization in a planned manner, in which 16 innocent people were killed, many were injured

 The central government has said that the manner in which these murders were carried out by female human bombs was also considered by the trial court as the rarest of the rare case
 hoicourt or supreme court bhi isse sahamat hue
 It was also said in the report of the Center that this murder was done in such a horrific manner that due to this, Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were also to be postponed in the country

 Before the Lok Sabha Election, the exercise has intensified regarding the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya

 He said that Bhagwat and the saints present at the two-day Hindu Acharya Sabha meeting at Rajkot, 210 km from Ahmedabad, expressly expressed the view that the construction of the temple should start before May 2019 when the term of the Narendra Modi government ends
 hindu netaaon ne bataaya ki baithak main amit shah ne bharosa diya ki ayodhya main mandir kaa nirmaan hoga
 Acharya Satgiri Maharaj, who attended the meeting held on Friday, said, 'the issue was discussed in detail

 santon ne kaha ki ve ram mandir nirmaan ko jitna jaldi sambhav ho aage badhanaa chaahate hai

 Will do something in three months
 ' supreme court dwaara babari masjid-ramajnmabhumi malikana haq vivaad par janvari main sunwaayi kiye jane kii ummid he
 Asked if the BJP was given an ultimatum to begin construction of the temple before 2019, Satgiri replied in the negative
 satgiri ne kaha, ‘mohanji ne apni ichha vyakt kii ki ramamandir kaa nirmaan 2019 chunaav se pehle shuru hona chahie lekin koi ultimatum nahin diya gaya
 Another saint said that Shah shared information about the legal case in the meeting and talked about the possibility of the Supreme Court taking up the case in January
 sant ne kaha, ‘amit shah ne hamen bharosa diya ki mandir kaa nirmaan usee sthal (ayodhya main vahiin jo ki vivaadon main he) par hoga
 'A third saint talked about being patient and said,' They (RSS and BJP) will do whatever is necessary (for temple construction)
 ' aresas pravaktaa vijay thakur ne kaha ki hindu acharya sabha kaa aayojan prayek do varsh par hota he jisamen hindu samaaj se sambandhit saamaajik, raajnneetik or shaikshanik muddon par charchaa hoti he
 Apart from Bhagwat and Shah, leaders like Ram Madhav and Subramanian Swamy also participated in the Hindu Sabha
 swami ne kaha ki daleelein hinduon ke paksh main hai ki unhen ramamandir ke liye jameen mil jaaegi lekin sawaal yah he ki ucchtam nyaayalay maamle kii sunwaayi kab karegaa
 He said, '(former Prime Minister) Narasimha Rao said that if it is proved that there was a temple at the same place then we will give the land to the Hindus, the Archaeological Survey of India has also proved this
 ' unhone kaha, ‘ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi faisla diya he ki namaaj ke liye masjid jaruri hissaa nahin he jo ki kahin bhi kii ja sakati he
 All things and arguments are in our favor
 ' He said, "now we have to see when the hearing takes place and when the verdict comes
" ' baithak rajkot main arsh vidya mandir main hui jisamen kareeb 100 pratibhaagiyon ne hissaa liya
 Hindutva organizations, including the RSS, have intensified their demand for early construction of the temple in the last few months and many, including Bhagwat, are insisting on making laws for it

 The government had announced to implement the recommendations of the Pay Commission from 1 January 2016
 lekin vetan ayog kii kai siforeeshon ke baad kendriya karmchaariyon ne kai muddon par apni aapatti jataai thi
 There was also a dispute regarding allowances in these issues

 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively

 Let the central employees wait for the government's decision on the issue of HRA, among other allowances
 yah intjaar ab ek saal kaa hone ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on June 28 last year, the government decided to implement the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission
 sarkaar ne vetan ayog kii siforishein 1 janvari 2016 se lagu karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 But after several recommendations of the Pay Commission, the Central employees had raised their objection on many issues
 in muddon main alounces ko lekar vivaad bhi tha
 The government constituted a committee for this
 samiti ne apni report 27 april, 2017 ko vittamantri ko saunp di thi
 This report was sent by the Finance Ministry to the committee of empowered secretaries
 ab is report par charchaa ke baad 1 june 2017 ko sachivon kii adhikaar praapt samiti ne ek cabinet note taiyaar kiya he

 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances

 aap us aadesh ko dekhie
 Look at the language
 aisa lagata he ki bank ke manjaron ko shikanje se baandh kar kisi gulam kii tarah heere ke khan main le jaaya ja rahaa he
 The head office has ordered all personnel not to go on leave
 aapako aadesh diya jaataa he ki yadi koi carmik biimaar hote hai evam chikitsa avkaash main prasthaan karte hai to ve mukhyalay main hi rahakar apana ilaaj karavaaenge or sambandhit kapi kshetreey karyaalay ko preshit karenge
 Otherwise your medical leave will not be approved and you will be unpaid
 avaitnaik karnaa yani selary nahin mili
 In this order, it is written that you cannot go out of the place where your branch is
 matlab ye hua ki muzaffarpur ke branch main kisi ko heart atake aayaa, liver main samasya hui to ve zile se baahar patna tak ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakate hai
 Whether such orders can be issued, the reality is that such horrendously terrible orders have been issued which are a direct violation of human rights
 hamaare jeene ke adhikaar, moulik adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 On reading the constitution, it would be known that only the officer who gave the order should have been sent to jail
 magar jab hamane likhaa or bolaa to chand ghante main nayaa aadesh tip ho gaya
 First order dated 5 March
 nayaa vaala aadesh 8 march kaa he
 It says, 'by making partial amendments in the said letter, all the branches are instructed that if any officer or personnel departs at the headquarters on medical leave, then the information will be given to the competent officer and the permission will be taken
 ' No one gets a holiday in banks easily
 uttar bihar gramin bank kii bhi kaaphi samasya he
 Generally we know less about such bank but there is no shortage of customers in these banks
 inaki bhoomika bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn hoti he
 Generally, rural banks are in places where government or private banks are not able to reach
 ham aaj iske ek branch kaa haal bataanaa chaahate hai
 There is a bank in a village in East Champaran where thousands of people climb the stairs daily
 is chote se kamare main yah branch chal rahi he jiske paas 12,000 khatadharak hai or karmchaaree sirf do hai
 There was no toilet within the bank for many days
 ab jaakar chat par shauchalay bananaa shuru hua he
 There are files on the outpost
 yahaan pataa chalaa ki gramin ilaake ke kaaran yahaan par internet kaa link kamazor hota he
 Speed is low due to which they face a lot of difficulty in uploading files
 thukne ke liye to sara sansar he magar bank ke graahak bank kii diwaar par hi ye krupa karte hai
 It is the spit center of the bank
 isi ke upar aag bujhane kaa yantra rakhaa he
 It was the order of North Bihar Gramin Bank that if you fall ill, you will not be able to go out of the district for treatment, now it is not mentioned in the new order
 24 ghante se kam samay main aadesh kii bhashaa badal gai
 If the cable had not done such a thing at the prime time, making the voice disappear, shutting down the program itself, reaching more people could have a faster impact on the life inside the banks
 aapane dekha ki kaise ek lekh likhane se, sahi sawaal uthaane se aadesh kii bhashaa badal jaati he
 The first order clearly states that you cannot go out of the headquarters, now in the order it is missing and it is said that you can leave with permission
 isiilie kahata hum ki jis tarah darshakon ne teen maheene tak ek film par dibet dekha he agar do maheene tak mere saath bainkon par yah series dekhe len to bankeron kii jindagi main khushiyaan laut aaengi or bahut saare sarkari jhooth kii pole khul jaaegi
 Men have also reacted well to the story of women bankers on Women's Day
 kaiyon ne messej kiya he ki ek ek baat sahi he
 a woman has written the condition of her life, you also read
 
 'ravish ji, it has been seven years since our marriage, in seven years we have been transferred to seven places
 wo bhi kabhi ek rajya main nahin hua
 Happened in a different state
 main chhattisgarh main kaam karti hum to pati kaa tabadalaa bengal main ho jaataa he
 It has been seven years of marriage, but the two of us did not live together
 transfar kaa aadesh milane ke aath din ke bheetar shift hona padataa he
 We also have to bear the cost of being shifted
 kai baar ek lakh tak kharch ho jaataa he
 The bank delays giving and also deducts 40-50 thousand while giving
 mahila diwas par aapane takalif bataai acha laga
 Along with women, men are also facing a lot of difficulties
 target dur karne ke liye ghar parivaar se dur rahanaa padataa he
 We have no life at all
 aapako kitna or kya kya bataaen
 ' ham kaaphi kuch jaan gaye hai
 The employees of the bank never said that they do not want to do the work of the bank
 ve kaam to kar hi rahe hai
 Nowadays, the contract for CBSE question papers is also on their head
 subah aath baje aate or raat ke aath baje jate hai
 This routine is normal and even after so much work the target and transfer threat and tension
 pati-patni ko saath yaa nazadik posting ke aadesh hai, sarkaar ke aadesh hai magar lagu nahin hota he
 Child care leave was not given to women bankers under what intrigue
 jabaki centre sarkaar ke sabhi vibhaagon main maa banane ke baad mahilaon ko child care live miltaa he
 This is the 11th issue of the Bank Series
 ab tak to kam se kam child care live kii ghoshnaa ho jaani chahie thi
 If we had the data, it would have been known how many women have not taken promotion to avoid the torture of target and transfer
 yah to mahila bankeron ke saath kiya jane vaala aparaadh he
 After our series, a woman told that she was asked to dress up to sell the policy
 yakeen nahin hota he ki yah sab sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ho rahaa he
 And we are showing on TV that a woman is flying a fighter plane
 uske liye badhai lekin un lakhon mahilaon kaa kya jo bainkon ke bheetar ghutan kii zindagi ji rahi hai
 Whose dreams are not able to fly
 bank series ke 9wein ank main hamane united bank of india ke aadesh kaa zikr kiya tha
 It said that the salary of branch manager, deputy manager would be withheld, AC and generator would be withdrawn, medical bills would not be paid
 ol india bank officers association ne isaki kadi ninda kii
 United Bank of India has withdrawn its order
 bank kaa enpie hoga to selary branch manager kii band hogi yaa chairamainon kii hogi
 Simple question
 kya aisa bhi aadesh jari ho saktaa he ki selary nahin di jaaegi
 Are there any fundamental rights to the work done within banks? bankeron kii selary nahin bad rahi he
 The IDBI people have been waiting since 2012
 baaki bankeron kaa kahana he ki 20 se 24000 kii selary main dilli kya chote shahar main bhi rahanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Bankers have started speaking for this
 21 march ko jantar-mantar par bankeron kaa ek samooh jamaa hone vaala he
 The language and tone of his posters are changing
 unhen selary bahut kam mil rahi he
 They do not just want to increase the salary but also want to match the union employees
 donon main kaaphi antar he
 In some banks, the banker has put a badge that i am a banker but my salary is less
 log dhire dhire apana cheharaa poster par daalane lage hai
 When the face comes out, one day the truth will also come
 sarkarein apane karmchaariyon ko soshal media par bolne nahin detii hai
 Ministers only keep speaking
 maamla anushaasan kaa nahin he, har karmchaaree apana dayera jaanata he, maamla he ki jhooth kahin baahar na aa jaae
 The comments tabadale kii kahani to aisi he ki pati or patni ke bich 1400 kimi kaa faasla he
 Salary is not the only thing in the job
 uske saath kaam kaa maahaul bhi mahatvapurn hota
 How can it happen that people are upset due to this in the whole bank
 is pareshaani kaa kaaran he miss sailing, krans sailing
 Selling insurance by fraud, selling insurance without knowing
 aaj hi ek sajjan ne likhaa ki uske khate se 500 rupee cat gaya or beemaa ho gaya
 When he went to the bank, he was asked to apply
 is tarah ke anubhav se na jane kitne log guzare honge
 The situation has become such that the banker's parents, and now their children are also writing letters or are being written to them so that there is some effect

 It is possible to be printed and i was missed, but you will also google and see if it was printed
 is series ke kaaran logon ne itani jaankaree di he jitani main jivan bhar main hasil nahin kar saktaa tha
 Unpaid means salary was not received
 is aadesh main ye likhaa he ki aapkaa jahaan branch he us jagah se baahar nahin ja sakate
 This means that someone in the Muzaffarpur branch had a heart attack, if he had a liver problem, he could not go out of the district to Patna for treatment
 kya is tarah ke aadesh jari kiye ja sakate hai, hakeekat yah he ki is tarah ke bhayanak bhayanak aadesh jari kiye gaye hai jo maanavadhikaar kaa sidhaa sidhaa ulanghan hai
 Our right to live is a violation of the fundamental right
 samvidhan padhate to pataa chalata ki aadesh dene vaale afasar ko hi jail bhej dena chahie tha
 But when we wrote and spoke, in a few hours a new order was typed
 pehla aadesh 5 march kaa
 The new one is dated 8 March
 isamen likhaa he, 'ukt patr main aanshik sanshodhan karte hue sabhi shakhaon ko nirdesh diya jaataa he ki yadi koi adhikari yaa karmi chikitsa avkaash main mukhyalay main prasthaan karte hai to isaki soochna sakasham padaadhikari ko dekar anumati lenaa sunishchit karenge

 North Bihar Gramin Bank also has a problem
 aam taur par ham aise bank ke bare main kam jaanate hai magar in bainkon main graahakon kii koi kami nahin rahati he
 Their role is also very important
 aam taur par gramin bank waisi jagahon par hote hai jahaan par sarkari yaa privet bank nahin pahunch pate hai
 We want to tell the condition of one of its branches today
 purvi champaran ke ek gaanv main ek bank he jahaan hazaron log sidhiyon se chadhakar rose aate hai
 This branch is running in this small room which has 12,000 account holders and only two employees
 bank ke bheetar bahut dinon se koi shauchalay nahin tha
 Now the toilet has started being built on the roof
 chaowkee par filein rakhi hui hai
 It was found here that due to rural area, the internet link here is weak
 speed kam hoti he jiske kaaran file aplod karne main inhen kaaphi dikkat aati he
 There is a whole world for spitting, but the customers of the bank take this grace on the bank wall
 yah bank kaa thook centre he
 a fire extinguisher is placed on top of it
 isi uttar bihar gramin bank kaa aadesh tha ki biimaar pad jaaenge to zile se baahar ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakenge, ab nae aadesh main iskaa zikr nahin he
 The language of the order changed in less than 24 hours
 agar cabel waalon ne prime time ke samay awaz gaayab kar dena, kaarykram hi band kar dena, is tarah kaa kaam na kiya hota to zyaada logon tak pahunch kar bainkon ke bheetar kii zindagi par tezi se asar ho saktaa tha
 You have seen how by writing an article, raising the right question changes the language of the order
 pehle aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki aap mukhyalay se baahar nahin ja sakate, ab ke aadesh main yah gaayab he or kaha gaya he ki anumati lekar prasthaan kar sakate hai
 That is why i say that the way the audience has seen debates on a film for three months, if i see this series on the banks with me for two months, then the happiness of the bankers will be returned and a lot of government lies will be exposed
 mahila diwas par mahila bankeron kii daastaan par purushon ne bhi acchhee pratikriya vyakt kii he
 Many have messaged that one thing is right
 ek mahila ne apni zindagi kaa haal likhaa he, aap bhi padhie
 
 'raveesh ji, hamaari shaadi ko saat saal ho gaye, saat saal main hamaara tabadalaa saat jagahon par hua he
 That too never happened in one state
 alag-alag rajya main hua
 When i work in Chhattisgarh, my husband gets transferred to Bengal
 shaadi ke saat saal ho gaye magar ham donon saath nahin rahe
 Transfers have to shift within eight days of receiving the order
 shift hone kaa karcha bhi hamen hi uthaanaa padataa he
 Sometimes it costs up to one lakh
 bank dene main deree karata he or dete samay bhi 40-50 hazaar kaat letaa he
 Nice to have you on Women's Day
 mahilaon ke saath-saath purushon ko bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One has to stay away from home family to overcome the target
 hamaari to koi zindagi hi nahin he
 Tell you how much and what
 ' We have come to know a lot
 bank ke karmchaariyon ne kabhi ye nahin kaha ki ve bank kaa kaam nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 They are working
 aajkal sibiesai ke prashn patron kaa bhi theka inhen ke sar par he
 Come at eight in the morning and go at eight in the night
 ye routine saamaanya he or itane kaam ke baad bhi target or transfar kii dhamkee or tanaav
 Spouses have orders with or near postings, government orders, but do not apply
 mahila bankeron ko child care live aakhir kis saazish ke tahat nahin di gai
 Whereas, after becoming a mother in all departments of the central government, women get child care leave
 bank series kaa yah 11waan ank he
 By now at least the child care leave should have been announced
 kaash ki hamaare paas aankade hote to pataa chalata ki kitni mahilaon ne target or transfar kii yatnaa se bachane ke liye pramotion nahin liya he
 This is a crime committed with women bankers
 hamaari series ke baad ek mahila ne bataaya ki policy bechney ke liye unase sajane sanvarne ke liye kaha gaya
 It is not believed that all this is happening within public sector banks
 or ham tivi par dikhaa rahe hai ki ek mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi he
 Congratulations for that, but what about the millions of women who are leading suffocated lives within the banks
 jinke sapane udaan nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 In the 9th issue of Bank Series, we mentioned the order of United Bank of India
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki branch manager, dipti manager kii selary roak di jaaegi, asi or janarator hataa liya jayega, medical bill kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jayega
 The All India Bank Officers Association strongly condemned this
 unaidet bank of india ne apana wo aadesh waapas le liya he
 If the bank has an NPA, then the salary branch manager will be closed or the chairmen will be
 simpal sawaal he
 Can such an order be issued that salary will not be given
 kya bainkon ke bheetar jo kaam karte hai unke moulik adhikaar kuch bhi nahi hai
 Bankers' salary is not increasing
 idibiai vaale to 2012 se intazaar kar rahe hai
 The rest of the bankers say that in the salary of 20 to 24000, Delhi is becoming difficult to live even in a small city
 iske liye banker ab bolne lage hai
 a group of bankers are scheduled to gather at Jantar Mantar on 21 March
 unke postaron kii bhashaa or tevar main badlaav aane laga he
 He is receiving very little salary
 ve sirf selary kii badhottaree nahin chaahate balki kendriya karmchaariyon kii barabari chaahate hai
 There is a lot of difference between the two
 kuch bainkon main banker ne ek baij laga liya he ki main banker hum lekin meri selary kam he
 People are slowly putting their face on the poster
 jab cheharaa baahar aa jayega to ek din sach bhi aa jayega
 Governments do not let their employees speak on social media
 mantri hi bolte rahete hai
 The matter is not about discipline, every employee knows his scope, it is a matter that lies do not come out
 tippaniyan The story of the transfer is such that there is a distance of 1400 km between the husband and wife
 naukari main sirf selary hi sab kuch nahin hoti
 Work environment would also be important with him
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki saare bank main iske kaaran log pareshaan hai
 The reason for this problem is miss selling, cross selling
 dhokhe se beemaa bechnaa, bina jaankaree ke beemaa bechnaa
 Today a gentleman wrote that 500 rupees were deducted from his account and insured
 bank gaya to usee se kaha gaya ki aap aavedan dijie
 How many people must have passed through such an experience
 haalat yah ho gai he ki banker ke maa baap, or ab unke bachche bhi patr likh rahe hai yaa unase likhvaya ja rahaa he taaki kuch to asar ho
 For almost two years, i see every news published in the business newspapers once on the bank
 uskaa hindi anuwaad kar apane hindi ke pathakon ke liye apane blog yaa fasebuk pej par niyamit rup se likhata hum
 All the articles reveal big things, but the life inside the bank has become so difficult
 mumkin he chapa bhi ho or mujhase chhot gaya lekin aap bhi google kar dekhiegaa ki chapa tha yaa nahin
 Because of this series, people have given so much information that i could not achieve in a lifetime
 bainkon main kisi ko chuttee aasaani se nahin milti he
 North Bihar Gramin Bank also has a problem
 aam taur par ham aise bank ke bare main kam jaanate hai magar in bainkon main graahakon kii koi kami nahin rahati he
 Their role is also very important
 aam taur par gramin bank waisi jagahon par hote hai jahaan par sarkari yaa privet bank nahin pahunch pate hai

 mahila bankeron ko child care live aakhir kis saazish ke tahat nahin di gai
 Whereas, after becoming a mother in all departments of the central government, women get child care leave
 bank series kaa yah 11waan ank he
 By now at least the child care leave should have been announced
 kaash ki hamaare paas aankade hote to pataa chalata ki kitni mahilaon ne target or transfar kii yatnaa se bachane ke liye pramotion nahin liya he
 This is a crime committed with women bankers

 It is not believed that all this is happening within public sector banks
 or ham tivi par dikhaa rahe hai ki ek mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi he
 Congratulations for that, but what about the millions of women who are leading suffocated lives within the banks
 jinke sapane udaan nahin bhar paa rahe hai
 In the 9th issue of Bank Series, we mentioned the order of United Bank of India
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki branch manager, dipti manager kii selary roak di jaaegi, asi or janarator hataa liya jayega, medical bill kaa bhugtan nahin kiya jayega
 The All India Bank Officers Association strongly condemned this

 If the bank has an NPA, then the salary branch manager will be closed or the chairmen will be
 simpal sawaal he
 Can such an order be issued that salary will not be given
 kya bainkon ke bheetar jo kaam karte hai unke moulik adhikaar kuch bhi nahi hai
 Bankers' salary is not increasing
 idibiai vaale to 2012 se intazaar kar rahe hai
 The rest of the bankers say that in the salary of 20 to 24000, Delhi is becoming difficult to live even in a small city
 iske liye banker ab bolne lage hai
 a group of bankers are scheduled to gather at Jantar Mantar on 21 March

 He is receiving very little salary

 There is a lot of difference between the two
 kuch bainkon main banker ne ek baij laga liya he ki main banker hum lekin meri selary kam he
 People are slowly putting their face on the poster
 jab cheharaa baahar aa jayega to ek din sach bhi aa jayega
 Governments do not let their employees speak on social media
 mantri hi bolte rahete hai
 The matter is not about discipline, every employee knows his scope, it is a matter that lies do not come out
 tippaniyan The story of the transfer is such that there is a distance of 1400 km between the husband and wife
 naukari main sirf selary hi sab kuch nahin hoti
 Work environment would also be important with him
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki saare bank main iske kaaran log pareshaan hai
 The reason for this problem is miss selling, cross selling

 Because of this series, people have given so much information that i could not achieve in a lifetime
 isi uttar bihar gramin bank kaa aadesh tha ki biimaar pad jaaenge to zile se baahar ilaaj ke liye nahin ja sakenge, ab nae aadesh main iskaa zikr nahin he
 The language of the order changed in less than 24 hours
 agar cabel waalon ne prime time ke samay awaz gaayab kar dena, kaarykram hi band kar dena, is tarah kaa kaam na kiya hota to zyaada logon tak pahunch kar bainkon ke bheetar kii zindagi par tezi se asar ho saktaa tha
 You have seen how by writing an article, raising the right question changes the language of the order
 pehle aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki aap mukhyalay se baahar nahin ja sakate, ab ke aadesh main yah gaayab he or kaha gaya he ki anumati lekar prasthaan kar sakate hai
 That is why i say that the way the audience has seen debates on a film for three months, if i see this series on the banks with me for two months, then the happiness of the bankers will be returned and a lot of government lies will be exposed

 Nice to have you on Women's Day

 The employees of the bank never said that they do not want to do the work of the bank
 ve kaam to kar hi rahe hai
 Nowadays, the contract for CBSE question papers is also on their head
 subah aath baje aate or raat ke aath baje jate hai
 This routine is normal and even after so much work the target and transfer threat and tension
 pati-patni ko saath yaa nazadik posting ke aadesh hai, sarkaar ke aadesh hai magar lagu nahin hota he
 Child care leave was not given to women bankers under what intrigue
 jabaki centre sarkaar ke sabhi vibhaagon main maa banane ke baad mahilaon ko child care live miltaa he
 This is the 11th issue of the Bank Series
 ab tak to kam se kam child care live kii ghoshnaa ho jaani chahie thi
 If we had the data, it would have been known how many women have not taken promotion to avoid the torture of target and transfer
 yah to mahila bankeron ke saath kiya jane vaala aparaadh he
 After our series, a woman told that she was asked to dress up to sell the policy
 yakeen nahin hota he ki yah sab sarkari bainkon ke bheetar ho rahaa he
 And we are showing on TV that a woman is flying a fighter plane
 uske liye badhai lekin un lakhon mahilaon kaa kya jo bainkon ke bheetar ghutan kii zindagi ji rahi hai
 Whose dreams are not able to fly
 bank series ke 9wein ank main hamane united bank of india ke aadesh kaa zikr kiya tha
 It said that the salary of branch manager, deputy manager would be withheld, AC and generator would be withdrawn, medical bills would not be paid
 ol india bank officers association ne isaki kadi ninda kii
 United Bank of India has withdrawn its order
 bank kaa enpie hoga to selary branch manager kii band hogi yaa chairamainon kii hogi
 Simple question
 kya aisa bhi aadesh jari ho saktaa he ki selary nahin di jaaegi
 Are there any fundamental rights to the work done within banks? bankeron kii selary nahin bad rahi he
 The IDBI people have been waiting since 2012
 baaki bankeron kaa kahana he ki 20 se 24000 kii selary main dilli kya chote shahar main bhi rahanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 Bankers have started speaking for this
 21 march ko jantar-mantar par bankeron kaa ek samooh jamaa hone vaala he
 The language and tone of his posters are changing
 unhen selary bahut kam mil rahi he
 They do not just want to increase the salary but also want to match the union employees
 donon main kaaphi antar he
 In some banks, the banker has put a badge that i am a banker but my salary is less
 log dhire dhire apana cheharaa poster par daalane lage hai

 The comments tabadale kii kahani to aisi he ki pati or patni ke bich 1400 kimi kaa faasla he
 Salary is not the only thing in the job
 uske saath kaam kaa maahaul bhi mahatvapurn hota
 How can it happen that people are upset due to this in the whole bank
 is pareshaani kaa kaaran he miss sailing, krans sailing
 Selling insurance by fraud, selling insurance without knowing
 aaj hi ek sajjan ne likhaa ki uske khate se 500 rupee cat gaya or beemaa ho gaya
 When he went to the bank, he was asked to apply

 The situation has become such that the banker's parents, and now their children are also writing letters or are being written to them so that there is some effect

 After this, the final list will be published on 31 December
 jin logon kaa naam antim ensiaar main nahin hoga, unhen voting se vanchit kar diya jayega
 But due to corrupt and lax administration, it will not be possible to implement it strictly
 aise tamaam logon ne farji tareeke se aadhaar, pan card, rashan card or voter card tak banavaa liye hai
 That is, it may not be possible for the government to stop 'illegal migrants' from voting

 yahi nahin, sarkaar un logon ke naam pehle se registerd jameen yaa makaan ko apane haath main lene kii koshish karegi, jinka naam suchi main nahin he

 1 lollypop Amid heavy deployment of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan PM Imran Khan has appealed to US President Donald Trump to intervene in the case
 imran khan (imran Khan) ne twit karte hue kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki america raashtrapati donald trump (donald Trump) kashmir maamle main madhyasthata karen
 The Pakistani Prime Minister (imran Khan) wrote, "president Trump offered arbitration in the Kashmir case
 ab aisa karne kaa samay aa gaya he kyonki vahaan halaat kharaab ho rahe hai or niyantran rekha par bhartiya sena nae aakraamak kadam uthaa rahi he
 He said that these are the steps to fuel the regional crisis
 paak piem ne bharat ke saath achaanak bade tanaav ke maddenjar ravivaar ko desh ke sheersh naukarshahon or sainya adhikariyon ke saath rashtriya suraksha par charchaa ke liye enessi kii baithak bhi bulaai
 Imran Khan called the meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) following allegations by the Army that India has used cluster bombs to target common people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)
 haalanki, bhartiya sena ne shanivaar ko in aaropon ko "jhootha or managasaint" bataate hue khaarij kar diya tha
 The NSC meeting was attended by Defense Minister Pervez Khattak, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa and other top officials
 khan ne ek anya twit main kaha ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke prastaavon ke anusaar kashmir ke logon ko aatmanirnay ke unke adhikaar kaa upyog karne diya janaa chahie
 He said that the only path to peace and security in South Asia goes through a peaceful and just solution to the Kashmir problem
 gauratlab he ki imaaran khan ne kuch samay pehle bhi donald trump se is masale par baat kii thi
 Happy with the offer of US President Donald Trump's mediation to resolve the Kashmir issue, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said that this disputed issue between the two neighbors cannot be resolved bilaterally
 
 bharat or pakistan ke bich kashmir mudde paratrump (donald Trump)dwaara madhyasth banane kii peshkash kiye jane ke kuch hi ghante baad khan kaa yah bayaan saamne aayaa he
 Significantly, during the meeting at the White House, the two leaders discussed various issues including the Afghanistan peace process
 vahiin, bharat sarkaar ne trump (donald Trump) ke is daawey ko sire se khaarij kiya thaki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unase kashmir mudde par madhyasthata karne kaa anurodh kiya he
 Imran Khan, who went on a three-day trip to the US, welcomed the move
 america ke fox news se imran khan ne kaha tha ki dwipaksheeya tareeke se ham kabhi (kashmir vivaad) nahin sulajhaa sakenge
 "hours after the first meeting with Trump at the Oval Office, the Prime Minister of Pakistan said that there was a time when General (pervez) Musharraf and Prime Minister of India (atal Bihari) Vajpayee were, at that time we were very close to resolving the Kashmir issue
" Had arrived lekin uske baad se ham do alag-alag dhruvon par hai or mujhe vaaki lagata he ki bharat ko baatcheet kerani chahie
 America can play a big role in this
 raashtrapati trump vaaki mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 Subsequently when the anchor of Fox News read India's statement that India has always been of the view that all the pending issues with Pakistan will be resolved bilaterally, Khan said that we are 1 of this earth
 30 arab logon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Think if this issue is resolved then what will be the peace of peace
 is baat se sire se inkaar karte hue ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kabhi bhi kashmir par america madhyasthata kii baat kahi he, bharat ne kaha tha ki pakistan ke saath kisi prakaar ke sambandh ke liye seemaa paar se aatankwaad kaa band hona anivaary he
 The Simla Agreement and the Lahore Proclamation provide the basis for resolving all issues between India and Pakistan in a bilateral manner
 imran khan ne trump kii tippanee kaa swaagat karte hue kaha tha ki raashtrapati, main aapako bataa saktaa hum ki abhi agar aap madhyasthata karke is mudde ko sulajhaa sakate hai to aapako arabon logon kii duaen milengi
 In response to another question, Khan said that if India destroys its nuclear weapons, Pakistan will also eliminate them
 unhone kaha ki haa, kyonki parmaanu yuddh koi vikalp nahin he
 The idea of nuclear war between Pakistan and India is also going to ruin itself because our borders are interlinked for two and a half thousand miles
 imran khan ne kaha tha ki mujhe lagata he ki upmahadweep main logon main aisi bhaavana he ki farvari main kuch ghatnaayen hui thim or seemaa par phir se tanaav hua
 So people have this feeling and that's why i asked President Trump if he would like to play this role
 america duniya kaa sabase shaktishaalee desh he, ekmaatr aisa desh he jo kashmir mudde ko sulajhane ke liye pakistan or bharat ke bich madhyasthata kar saktaa he
 Imran Khan said that we have not been able to live like civilized neighbors for the last 70 years and only because of Kashmir

 The Delhi Jal Board has once again exposed a major case of corruption
 privet companiyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye jal board ke kuch adhikariyon ne niyam-kaayadon ko taak par rakhkar vibhaag ko karodon kaa chuunaa lagaaya or apni jeben bhar leen
 According to the information, the tender for some works was issued between 2016 and 2018, but the engineers of Delhi Jal Board gave these tenders to 17 companies, many of which were blacklisted by the vigilance team of Jal Board
 iske alaava jal board ne bina saamaan kii supplai or bina kaam puraa hue in fermon ko takreeban 5 karod kaa bhugtan bhi kar diya
 Jalford found three officers guilty in a departmental investigation that have been suspended
 rohinee, bharat nagar or shalimaar baag sivej pumping stesan ke kaam ke liye karodon kii peyament kii gai thi, lekin jab jalboard ke visilence vibhaag ne jaanch karai to pataa chalaa kaam hua hi nahin
 After this, the CEO of Jalboard approved Vigilance to investigate the matter with ACB (anti Corruption Branch)
 asibi ne apni shuruaati jaanch main paaya ki jal board ke adhikariyon ne farji bill or farji dastavejon kii madad se bina kaam ke hi blike listed companiyon ko karodo kaa bhugtan kar diya
 After its initial investigation, the ACB has registered three firs against three top officials of the Jal Board and 17 firms involved in the corruption in the case
 asibi ko lagata he ki bhrashtachar kaa ye maamla isse bhi bada ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the Jal Board's years old files are being imported and they are being searched
 asibi sutron ke mutabik, is maamle main jald hi jal board ke kuch adhikariyon or companiyon se jude logon ko giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The surprising thing in this case of corruption is that the game of corruption continued under the nose of the chairman of the Water Board and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, but Kejriwal did not even realize it
 is maamle par jal board ke vaais chairman dinesh mohaniya ne kaha ki yah maamla jal board ne hi anti karpshan beuro ko saunpa he, saath hi hamane un sabhi karmchaariyon ko suspend kar diya he
 After the matter came to light, Jal Board member and Delhi BJP vice-president Jai Prakash demanded action on the guilty officers, seeking an inquiry into the matter
 aapako bataa den ki kuch maheene pehle hi dilli kii anti karpshan branch ne dilli jal board ke teen injaneniyaron ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He was accused of paying 50 lakhs to three private companies while those companies had not completed their work
 kab kya hua ?4 april 2019-dilli jalboard ke visilence vibhaag ne 3 alag alag shikaayatein anti karpshan branch ko saunpi
 The complaints included the names of several officers, private firms and their contractors
 22 april 2019- anti karpshan branch ne teen exiaar darj kii, jisamen teen adhikariyon or 17 fermon ke naam darj kiye gaye
 This case has been registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act

 '' narendra modi sarkaar ke do saal puraa hone par uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan karne ke liye banaaya gaya 2
 This 46-minute song is continuing efforts on the public tongue
 lekin jis pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana ke jariye dhuaan hataane kaa dambh bharaa ja rahaa he, uski ek baangi dekhie
 Kalipur village in Nawada district of Bihar has been declared smokeless, but Kiran Devi of Kalipur village uses everyday and selected wood for cooking despite the gas connection found under Ujjwala
 pati pramod mistre kii aamadani se gharelu jaruratein bhi puri nahin ho paati thim, isliye gas conection nahin le pai thim
 Now she says, "the connection is free, but once the cylinder runs out, it will cost five to six hundred rupees, so let's save gas and try to use more dung or selected wood
" ''gas bachaane ke pahalu ke alaava garibon kii majaburi bhi he, jo unhen sahukaaron ke changul main fansaane lagi he
 Take the case of Kathwara village, 40 km from Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 is dalit bahul gaanv ke purvi kone par sthit ek jhonpadi main 35 varshiya puspa gautam ke ghar pichhali 10 july ko pehali baar gas kaa chulhaa jala
 Husband Raju is handicapped and barely able to feed five people including three children
 koyale ke dhuen kii vajah se dame kii beemaari se grast puspa ko ummid thi ki ab dhuen se nijaat mil jaaegi
 But when the previous revolving cylinder was exhausted, it was Rs 530 to fill the gas
 kaa jugad karne kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya
 Raju's wages were closed due to floods in Gomti, there was no option left, so Pushpa paid Rs 550 as advance to a moneylender from the village
 udhaar lekar duusare silendar kaa bandobast kiya
 She explains, "the poor like us do not have the quirk of getting a second cylinder
" kisi tarah paison kaa jugad karne ke liye phir se sahukaaron ke changul main funs rahe hai
 "there is a similar challenge for refilling before most of the poor families of this village
 lekin is yojana kaa sakaaratmak pahalu bhi he jo garib pariwaron main utsaah kaa sanchaar kar rahaa he
 The family of Jitendra Chandravanshi of Kalipur village is considering the Ujjwala scheme as a boon
 unki patni seemaa kahati hai, ''parivaar ke 15 sadasyon kaa khaanaa banane main rojaanaa 25-30 rupye kii lakdi kharch hoti thi
 Trouble is reduced with gas connections
 silendar 25 din hi chalata he lekin upale or lakdi bhi uplabdh he
 "in such a situation, the question arises that till now the poor families of Ujjwala who are living hell life amidst the smoke, will the smoke really come out of their houses? The solution will come from the small cylinder? Actually, these problems coming in the Ujjwala scheme
 The main reason for this is the easy availability of conventional fuel in the villages
 jarurat ke hisaab se log kerosine, koyala, lakdi, upale aadi kaa istemaal kar lete hai, jabaki alpiji ke liye ekamusth raashi deni padati he
 But according to the mathematics of the government, the use of wood etc
 is more expensive than LPG
 petroleum mantralay ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, prati parivaar ek saal main ausatan khapat 6 silendar he or uski keemat nikaali jaae to yah kareeb 9 rupye rojaanaa baithti he
 The ministry is offering this scheme as a much more economical model than conventional fuels
 kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan india today se kehete hai, ''yah baat sahi he ki maheene-do maheene main 450-500 ru
 Spending is a challenge for the poor
 lekin yah samasya nahin he, main ise chunauti maanata hum jis par hamaari tel companiyaan kaam kar rahi hai
 In future, it may be that the size of the cylinder will be reduced according to the need and demand of the people
 lekin usase pehle ham chaahate hai ki conection 80-85 fisadi pariwaron tak pahunch jaae, phir riphiling kii chunauti ke liye dirghakaalik ranneeti banaaenge
 He claims that 60 per cent of Ujjwala beneficiaries have started refilling
 kaise bani ujjwala kii ranneetikendre main bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad sabsidi ko sidhe khate main hastantarit karne kii pahal shuru hui, jiske jariye farji conekshnon ko rokane kaa abhiyaan chalaa or sarkaar ne 21,000 karod ru
 Save
 iske baad 27 march, 2015 ko petroleum mantralay ke urja sangam kaarykram main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 'give it ap' kii apil kii
 He appealed to the affluent to give up LPG subsidy, but according to Pradhan, what the Prime Minister said in the program that "the money left from the give it up will not be in the coffers of the government but the poor"
 The plan structure was formed
 lekin tathy yah he ki upie sarkaar ne sabsidi hastantaran ke liye debiti yojana shuru kii thi, par supreme court kii ore se aadhaar card ko lekar die gaye faisle se maamla atak gaya
 At that time the price of petroleum products was very high in the international market
 modi sarkaar ke vakt yah achaanak kaaphi neeche aa gai, jiskaa phayda uthaakar sarkaar ne saamaajik yojana kii neenv rakhi
 The government used the remaining money to provide LPG connections to the poor
 isamen tel companiyon ke siesaar fund se 1,000 karod ru
 Pooled and about 65 lakh new connections were distributed
 bipiel pariwaron main utsaah dekhne ke baad sarkaar ne ise ek thos yojana ke taur par aage badhaane kii ranneeti banaai taaki uskaa rajnatik laabh bhi uthaaya ja sake
 In January and February this year, it was decided to provide a door-to-door connection
 aanan-fanan main agle teen saal ke liye 8,000 karod ru
 Budget provision was made
 10 march ko cabinet kii manjuuri, 31 march ko adhisuchana ke baad 1 may ko ise launch kar diya gaya
 But to make this scheme effective on the ground, young officers of oil companies were posted as Nodal Officers (dnos) in every district
 unka kaam vitarakon se samanvay kar lakshya ke mutabik conection baantnaa he
 Some problems are happy and there is no doubt that there is enthusiasm among the poor about the scheme, but most of the problems are about refilling
 haalanki kai jagah abhi bhi conection nahin milane se logon main naaraazgi he
 Indradev Paswan of Bharosa village of Nawada district of Bihar has been traveling the agency for one and a half months, while 80% of the population in the Dalit-dominated Shivpuri village near Lucknow is BPL but due to the difference in the names of the economic census and Aadhaar card, people Can't find connections is gaanv main abhi tak ek bhi conection jari nahin ho paaya he
 People are disturbed by data corruption and fear of retrenchment despite eligibility
 lekin petroleum mantri kii daleel he ki yah aankada rajyon ne hi taiyaar kiya he or isi ke aadhaar par logon ko conection die ja rahe hai, jabaki madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main bhi log gafalat main hai
 People are considering it as a free plan, while only the connection is free and the consumer has to pay the price of the first cylinder with the stove
 bhopal ke nikat balampur kii rekha bai kahati hai, ''silendar ke liye do-do hafte kaa intjaar karnaa pad rahaa he
 "but Ramawati of Jokiyari village in Bihar's border Raxaul block says," Now the uplands are less, dependent on straw, straw, but the scheme has become a boon
 silendar ke istemaal se kerosine kii bhi khapat is maheene ek litre kam hui he
 "the lady of this village, Lachminia, puts a veil on her head," says, "now food is made quickly
" pehle mehmaan ke aane par kaaphi dikkat hoti thi
 The arrival of gas is saving both time and firewood
 ''kerosine cote main hogi katautlpiji kii suvidha ghar-ghar tak pahunchane ke lakshya ke saath sarkaar kerosine kii sabsidi ko khatm karne kii ranneeti par kadam badha chuki he
 In villages, it is used for lighting and cooking
 pradhan kehete hai ki do sabsidi ek saath nahin mil sakati
 But the house which does not have an alternative system of fuel and lights, will be found there
 sarkaar ise bhi nakad hastantaran yojana main shaamil karne ja rahi he
 It will be launched as the first pilot project in six districts of Jharkhand from October
 centre sarkaar ne rajyon ko kerosine cote main katautee karne ke liye protsaahan yojana shuru kii he
 In this, 75 percent of the subsidy savings will be given back to the states
 is saal 5 fisadi kota kam bhi kiya ja chukaa he, jabaki haryana, telugana, karnataka ne svaichhik katautee kii ichha jataa di he
 Politics of bread! Petroleum Minister denies any political benefit from the Ujjwala scheme
 unka maananaa he ki yah yojana saamaajik-rajnatik badlaav kii nazeer banegi
 This will reduce health expenditure besides empowering women and protecting the environment
 khaanaa banane main lagane vaala samay bachane se use duusare utpaadak kaamon main lagaaya ja sakegaa
 This is the first such scheme of the Modi government which is directly reaching home like the UPA government's MGNREGA
 isliye sarkaar ne ise 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle tak 5 karod bipiel pariwaron tak pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The BJP will publicize it in the election that LPG used to be a very rare thing before the Vajpayee government first came to the country in 1955
 lekin modi sarkaar ne ise har garib tak pahunchane kaa lakshya liya
 While implementing this scheme, when the government looked at the socio-economic census data, it also showed a formula to increase its social base
 desh bhar main is yojana se laabh lene vaale logon main 40 fisadi essi-asti hai, jabaki akele uttar pradesh main 45 fisadi dalit parivaar iske labhaarthi honge
 Therefore, this scheme was started from Ballia in UP
 pradhan ke shabdon main, ''is yojana ke peeche hamaare adarsh pan
 Deendayal Upadhyay has an integrated human philosophy because his ideology is at the center
 '' so sarkaar ne is yojana ke vitaran main prabud logon ke saath nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko joda he
 It was also distributed to freedom fighters on the occasion of 70 years of independence
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab beeti 1 may ko upi ke baliya se is yojana kaa shubharambh kiya to unhone kaha tha, ''ek garib maa lakdi se chuulhe par khaanaa banaati he to ek din main 400 cigarette ke baraabar dhuna uske andar jaataa he
 Children are forced to eat food in the same smoke
 main is jindagi ko bachapan main jikar aayaa hum, isliye 5 karod garib pariwaron ko rasoi gas dene kaa faisla kiya
 '' But once giving LPG, will the house become smoke free? Housewives like Pushpa and Kiran struggle with economic crisis every month-two months
 sarkaar ne dirghakaalik mukammal taiyaari nahin kii to kahin aisa na ho ki ujjwala yojana van time gikrat banakar rah jaae
 (together Ashish Mishra, Ashok Kumar Priyadarshi, Kunal Pratap Singh and Shuraih Niazi) karnataka main baari barish or baadh ne tabaahi machaa di he
 Hundreds of houses have perished in the water and many have been washed away
 yahi nahin, shaharon ko jodne vaale kai pul bhi tut gaye hai
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has said that assistance of Rs 5 lakh will be given to the victims
 unhone kaha ki dakshin kannada jile main 5 pul or 300 ghar barbaad ho gaye hai
 Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa in Belthangady, Dakshina Kannada: 5 bridges & 300 houses damaged or completely destroyed in the floods in the district
