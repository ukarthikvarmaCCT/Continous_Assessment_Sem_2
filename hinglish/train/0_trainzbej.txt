 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad targeted Congress National Secretary Rahul Gandhi and asked why Rahul Lokpal does not speak against inflation and corruption
 vah 2ji spactrum va rashtramandal ghotaale ke bare main kyon chuppi saadhe hue he
 He said that why Rahul, who calls the people of Uttar Pradesh a beggar, eats food in his house
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki rahul gandhi kendra main baithkar desh ko lut rahe he or vahi pradesh main baithi mayawati ko bhi pradesh kii janata ko lut rahi he
 In five years, the Maya government did nothing except loot the people of Uttar Pradesh

Karva Chauth, you are going out with a sieve, my muddy house What shines less in itself? You see the moon with a sieve, you also filter the moonlight!

 Political observers have said this
 malishka ne monsoon ke mausam main mumbai kii sadakon par gaddhon ko lekar apane gane main nagar nikaay kaa majaak udaaya tha
 Shiv Sena leaders claim that Malishka's satirical video misrepresented the image of the Shiv Sena-ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation

 Aditya's efforts to attract youth to the party may fail due to his haste
 is bare main party pravaktaa manisha kayande ne kaha ki hamen yuva peedi ke saath sampark na tuutane dene ke liye atirikt prayaas karne honge
 Some of them will be disappointed by the recent actions of the party, but we have to convince them
 kayande ne ye bhi kaha ki radio jocky zyaadaatar manoranjan main hai
 Why they should comment on social issues, especially when they are far from the ground reality
 pradesh bhaajapa ke mukhya pravaktaa madhav bhandari ne kaha ki shivasena kaa ravaiya isaki shuruyaat ke samay se mushkil se hi badla hoga
 His attitude towards criticism has remained unchanged, which is reflected in the Malishka episode
 desh kii sabase badi jaanch agencisibiai kaa istemaal sarkaar hameshaa apane liye karti he
 Such things have always happened, but this would hardly have happened when the CBI Chief, while in office, admitted that there was pressure on him
 vesupreme courtki is tippanee se sahamat dikhe kisibiai sarkaar kaa tota he
 In a special conversation with Mail Today, Ranjit Sinha said that the CBI has to depend on the government machinery for everything
 ranjit sinha sibiai ke nideshak kii kursi par virajman hai or aaj ye bhi unheen tamaam sawaalon se ghire hue hai, jo aaj se pehle ke sibiai nideshkon par uthte rahe hai
 The question is whether the CBI has not got freedom to function
 khaskar ye sawaal tab or bhi bade ho gaye hai, jab koyala aavanton ghotaale kii states report main dakhal dene ke liye supreme court ne sarkaar ko khub khari-khoti sunai or kaha ki aisi vyavastha ho ki sibiai ko jaanch kii swatantraaa mili
 Actions have started in the government on the Supreme Court's comment, but CBI Director Ranjit Sinha himself also believes that it is very important
 ranjit sinha ne khud kaha ki aaj main har kaam ke liye sarkaar par nirbhar hum
 Whether people want it, there is a basic need or there is a need
 aise main main sarkaar kaa hi ek hissaa ban gaya hum
 a director can only reinstate inspector in CBI and nothing else
 sibiai nideshak ne apni majaburiyon ko sarkari tantra ke dhaanche main dhalkar samajhane kii koshish kii
 He told Mail Today how a circle of government machinery is spread around the CBI
 sinha ne kaha ki sibiai ko cader kii manjuuri ke liye grih mantralay par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Ranjit Sinha says that for daily work, money, new officers, the Ministry of Personnel has to face the face
 dspi rank se upar kii bahaali ke liye upiessi par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 The Ministry of Law has to look for special lawyers
 bhrashtachar nirodhi keson ke liye sivisi ko jawaab dena hota he
 From the perspective of the Supreme Court, the IPS lobby Khushsurakar has formed a committee to give autonomy to the CBI
 chidambaram, sibbal or narayansami kii ye cameti bill banane main lagi he
 Ranjit Sinha says that this new CBI Act should be passed as soon as possible
 supreme court ne nazariye se ham sab khush hai
 The entire IPS lobby is happy
 sinha ne kaha sabase acchhee baat ye he ki adaalat ne aisi vyavastha di he ki sibiai kahin belgaum ghoda naa ban jaae
 In 1993, a petition was given for such a CBI, which took 20 years to implement
 mail today se kahi baton main jaahir he ki sibiai dabaav main kaam kar rahi he or in dabaavon se nikalne ke liye wo chatapata bhi rahi he
 There were many more questions for Sinha
 ek sawaal lajimi bhi tha, mail today ne poocha bhi ki rail ghuscand kaa kya hoga? ranjit sinha bachate hue nikal gaye ki abhi kuch nahin bataaungaa

 Navjot Singh Sidhu finally had to leave the cabinet post after a long series of political feud with Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh
 siddhu ne istipha dene ke 35 din baad ravivaar ko apana faisla saarvajanik kiya
 Sidhu wrote his resignation letter to the Congress President only on 10 June
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki 10 june ko hi unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 After a long wait, he revealed it on 14 July
 lekin sawaal yah bhi uth rahe hai ki siddhu ne aakhir rahul gandhi ko istipha kyon diya, jabaki rahul gandhi 25 may ko hi congress ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de chuke the
 However, there were efforts to persuade him for a long time after that
 lekin punjab kii baat kii jaae to congress main navjot singh siddhu kii pari mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke saath raajnneetik spardhaa kii rahi
 Sidhu left the BJP in July 2016 and joined Congress
 iske baad darjanon aise maukey aae jab captain or siddhu ke bich cold waar jaisi sthiti rahi
 The Cold War reached its zenith on 6 June, when Captain Amarinder Singh reorganized his cabinet and Sidhu was sacked as the Urban Development Ministry
 naye mantrimandal main siddhu ko urja mantralay saunpa gaya tha
 He then met Rahul Gandhi on 10 June and submitted his resignation
 unhone isaki saarvajanik ghoshnaa nahin kii thi
 However, Rahul Gandhi himself had announced his resignation from the post of Congress President on 25 May itself
 is bich siddhu ne na to apane naye vibhaag ko jwine kiya or na hi ve daftar pahunche
 Sidhu also stayed away from media
 ab chitthee saarvajanik karne ke baad unhone ghoshnaa kii he ki wo siem ko bhi apana istipha bhejenge
 Questions are arising that why did Sidhu first submit his resignation to the Congress president? It is said that Sidhu has been considering Rahul Gandhi as his leader
 siddhu ne captain ko kabhi us tarah kii tavajjo nahin di jaisaa captain amarinder singh apeksha rakhte the
 The dispute between the two continued to escalate with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan going to the swearing-in ceremony
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar kaa thikra captain ne siddhu par phoda
 He changed Sidhu's ministry
 siddhu ne ise apni haar ke rup main liya or rahul gandhi se mili
 Navjot Singh Sidhu wanted Rahul Gandhi to intervene in this
 agar siddhu pad chhodane par adig hote to istipha rajyapal yaa mukhyamantri ko saunpte lekin kahin na kahin unhen lag rahaa tha ki rahul gandhi ke hastkshep se unki kursi bhi batch jaaegi or mantrimandal main unhen vahi pratishtha hasil ho jaaegi
 But this could not be possible in the changing developments
 rahul gandhi ne khud pad chhodane kii thaan lee, unhone baar-baar yah bhi kaha ki haar ke liye jo log jimmedaar hai unhen bhi pad chhod dena chahie
 For the poor performance in the Lok Sabha, Congress won 8 out of 13 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Sidhu
 is pradarshan par pratikriya dete hue punjab siem ne navjot singh siddhu par hamalaa bolaa tha or kaha tha ki shahari vikaas mantri ke rup main unke kharaab pradarshan kii vajah se congress ne 5 siten ganvaa di
 The Captain had said that the urban vote bank has been the backbone of the Congress, but Sidhu failed to do development work during his tenure and the Congress had to bear the consequences
 'main sirf punjab ke logon ke prati jimmedaar'captain ke saath panga lene main siddhu bhi peeche nahin rahe
 When Amarinder Singh blamed Sidhu for the poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, Sidhu had also said that his department was being deliberately held responsible, saying that he was only responsible to the people of Punjab
 siddhu ne kaha tha, "ye samuhik jimmedaari he, mere vibhaag ko jaanboojhkar nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he, ek vyakti ke paas chizon sahi paripekshya main dekhne kii kshamta honi chahie, mujhe granted nahin liya ja saktaa he, main hameshaa se parform karne vaala rahaa hum, meri jimmedaari sirf punjab ke logon ke prati he

 yahaan log apni apni ichchhaaon ke saath bhagwaan venkateshwar ke saamne sir jhukaate hai, badi badi hastiyaan bhi yahaan maathaa techne aati hai
 However these days this temple is in discussion for some other reasons and the reason behind it is the famous 'tirupati Laddoo'
 ' It is being told that the hill temple of Lord Venkateswara has suffered more than Rs 140 crore in the last three years due to the famous 'tirupati laddu'
 iske peeche kii vajah laddu ke riyayati dar or kuch shraddhaluon ko ise muft main baantnabataya ja rahaa he
 According to temple sources, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam has been selling this delicious dessert at a discounted rate of Rs 25 per laddu for the last 11 years, whereas its actual cost is 32
 50 rupaye prati laddu he
 Laddus, made in the huge kitchen near the temple near Tirumala, are in great demand among devotees, who arrive here from different parts of the country throughout the year
 sutron ne bataaya he ki 2016 main kareeb das karod laddu bike
 Selling laddus at a discounted rate does not cost much, at the same time, the devotees who are offering free darshan and waiting in queues for several hours are given a rate of ten rupees per laddu, causing a loss of about Rs 23 crore
 iske alaava kareeb 11 kilometre paidal chalakar aane vaale shraddhaluon ko ek-ek laddu muft main diya jaataa he, jisase salanaa 22
 There is a loss of Rs 7 crore

 gujarat chunaav ko lekar yojit panchayat ajtak ke manch par patidaar netaa hardik patel, pichhadi jati ke netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ek saath aae
 The three young leaders took fierce action against the BJP government of Gujarat
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi sarkaar ko satta se bedakhal karne kii baat bhi ekasur main teenon ne kahi
 This session was moderated by Anjana Om Kashyap
 hardik ne kaha ki bharat kii pahchaan hi anekta main ekta he
 Since the country, there has been caste
 ek karod 20 lakh patidaar hai
 It is my duty to talk about the community that i come from
 patel ne kaha ki yadi modi sarkaar yaa koi bhi sarkaar angrej banane kii koshish karegi to aam aadmi ke paas bhagat singh banane ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 Hardik said that reservation has been talked about in the constitution, so in the same constitution there has been talk of the right of everyone
 aaj patel samudaay kii haalat kaaphi kharaab he
 Therefore he should get reservation
 obisi cote ko 27 fisadi se badhaakar 30 se 32 fisadi karen or patelon ko obisi main shaamil karen
 Patidars want reservation irrespective of where the government brings it
 unhone kaha ki aarakshan ko khatm karne kii baat koun kar rahaa he? baba sahab ne aarakshan ko khatm karne kii baat kabhi nahin kahin, balki samiksha karne kii baat kahi he
 Caste is not my oxygen
 bullate train se nahin hoga vikasunhone kaha ki bullate train se gujarat kaa vikaas nahin hoga
 Fund the bullet train for the development of Gujarat so that the youth of Gujarat can get employment
 unhone kaha ki mujhe dalit, obisi se koi dikkat nahin he
 All three of us were eating food in the same plate
 isse behatar kya ho saktaa he
 Patel said- i am not the b team of the Congress
 Hardik said that this time assembly election is of 6 crore people of Gujarat, which is against BJP
 iskaa phayda kise milegaa sab jaanate hai
 Call me the b team of Congress
 mai satta ke khilaaf hum, or dam lagaakar bijepi ko haraayenge
 This fight is for a youth like us
 22 saal se satta main baithe log ne kya kya he sab jagajaahir he
 Hardik said that i am proud of my movement
 mai dam lagaakar kahata hum ki mujhe aarakshan chahie
 Children in my community are killed
 sarkaar main baithe log napushank hai
 Torture women aisi sarkaar ko satta se ukhaadne ke liye ham kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 I've been to jail and what didn't i do to harass me
 raat ke 12 baje jail kaa get khulwaaya jaataa tha or meri barrack bhi khulavaate the
 The law is being made fun of
 hardik ne kaha ki sanvaidhanik taur par aarakshan detii hai to nishchit rup se andolan khatm kar detii he
 We are not constitutionally the age to contest elections
 gujarat sarkaar ke naak ke neeche bechi ja rahi sharaab: alpesh thakurobisi netaa alpesh thakur ne kaha ki meri ladaai adhikaar ke liye he
 The talk of Gujarat is that 7 lakh youth are unemployed
 garib patidaaron ko unka haq milanaa chahie
 See reservation should be empowered by the rights it has got
 unhone kaha ki obisi essi asti ke logon ko wo sab adhikaar mili jo sampann samaaj ke logon ko mili hue hai
 Alpesh said that hundreds of people die every year due to country liquor
 gujarat main deshi sharaab lagaataar bechi ja rahi he
 Liquor is being sold under the name of the government and the government is sitting hand in hand
 alpesh thakur ne kaha ki aaj gujarat kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 Development is talked about, it is just pretense
 aaj gujarat ke lakhon logon ke paas rojgaar nahin he or kisaan pareshaan he
 Had Gujarat grown and the youth got jobs, Hardik Alpesh and Jignesh Mevani would not have stood
 alpesh ne kaha ki gujarat main shiksha kaa nijeekaran kar diya gaya he
 Our fight is with the system
 do karod logon se rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin kise rojgaar mila
 The floods in Gujarat devastated, the government gave them compensation, which was not even damaged
 gujarat sarkaar ne patidaar ko bulaayaa or baat kii, kyonki ye samridh siyaasi taur par taqatvar he
 But not called to hear our problem
 isse sarkaar kii manshaa ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Alpesh said that we should scare the lakhs of government but we are not afraid
 modi jab gujarat aate hai police hamen uthaa leti he-jignesh mevanijignesh mevani ne kaha modi ji jitne baar gujarat aate hai, utani barpulice mujhe subah sava 6 baje uthaa letihai
 What the hell am i afraid of? Police are put in my house 24 hours, i am being intimidated
 ye gambhir sawaal he
 Jignesh said that if i want to do any sit-in then i should let it do
 oona main dalit ko na peeta jaataa or utpidan nahin hota to 50 lakh dalit sadak par nahin aate hai
 He said that the land has been distributed to Dalits in Gujarat, its lease was not found
 sarkaar baat nahin karti he
 Gujarat has 7 per cent Dalits but 17 per cent in the country
 agar ham teenon milakar bijepi ko 130 siton par nuksaan karenge
 Jignesh said that the motive of the Dalit movement is not power
 hamaara sangharsh jatimulak samaaj kii sthapana he
 He said that we are raising questions by becoming Gujaratis
 narmada nadi ke kinare based logon ko basaaya jaataa to aaj log dharne par nahin baithte
 Jignesh said that this time the Gujarat Assembly elections will not vote in the name of caste, but will have to oust the BJP from power
 jignesh ne kaha ki gujarat main bullate train laai ja rahi he, lekin rajya main lakhon bachche kuposhit hai, aspataal main khun ke dhabbe vaali chadar milti he
 What is the condition of GDP today? in sabake ke khilaaf khadey ho to sarkaar daraane kaa kaam karti he
 He said that if he is in favor of the government, the country is lover and the person who opposes and picket against the government is declared as a malevolent

 On the evening of Saturday, September 13, several bomb blasts rocked the capital
 visphot rajdhani ke sabase bheed vaale bazaaron main hue, jinamein 25 log maare gaye or 200 ghayal hue
 Six days later, Delhi Police raided a flat in Zakir Nagar, where many students of Jamia Millia Islamia - which is nearby - live
 chaape ke dauraan flats main rahane vaale do log maare gaye or is abhiyaan kii aguai karne vaala or puraskaron se sammanit saahsee police adhikari bhi maaraa gaya
 Muhammad Saif living here was arrested
 police ne ghoshnaa kii ki maare gaye logon main ek kaa naam tha aatif, jo asal main visphoton kaa sutaradhar tha
 Two members of the terrorist gang managed to escape
 jakir nagar ke is flats ke keretekar abdul rahamaan kii madad se 21 sitambar ko teen or log giraftaar kiye gaye
 These were the three young men with high education - zia-ur-rehman, Saqib Nisar and Mohammad Shakeel
 in par indian mujahidin ke bade karrwai daste kaa sadsy hone or na keval dilli balki ahmedabad or jaipur main bhi bam rakhane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 Rahman, Nisar, Shakeel were presented before the media and then taken for police interrogation
 india today ke mihir shrivastav teenon se khaas baatcheet karne main safal ho gaye
 Here the details of their conversation are being presented
 ye teenon utsaah se bhare yuva chaatr najar aate hai, clin shev, shikshit, aadhunik pahanava, mridubhashi, pados main rahane vaale ladakon kii tarah
 They are just above the age of twenty years
 jakir nagar se unki giraftaar ke baad unke ek saajhe dost ne jakir nagar thane main teenon se do mulaakaaten karwaain or baad main jab unki giraftaar kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye dakshin dilli jila police ne samvaadadaata sammelan kiya to ek mulaakaat or hui
 These meetings culminated in an open debate, which is horrifying from the point of view of the perversion of the ideology, hidden in what they said, and the sense of vengeance is equally frightening
 apni vibhats dehshatgardi, baari tabaahi tathaa mauton ko jis tarah ve bayaan karte hai, vah adhik bhaybheet karne vaala he
 Even more worrisome is that they look like youngsters appearing at local barista cafes or busy on their laptops in a cybercafé
 lekin jaraa kareeb se dekhie to unki nas-nas main dwesh bharaa milegaa
 They are the moving bombs, which cause great destruction in the name of Allah in minutes, that too without any remorse
 upar se ve sahaj dikhte hai magar bheetar ve pratadit hone ke aakrosh se bhare hai
 It has captured their intelligence so much that they have voluntarily become puppets in the hands of the perpetrators of terrorism
 jiya-ur-rahamaan, 24,jamiya millia islamia kaa tisare varsh kaa chaatr
 He is accused of planting bombs in Connaught Place and Ahmedabad and also providing material to terrorists, etc
 jiya-ur-rahamaan apane pita ke saath baitha he
 The father has also been arrested for furnishing fake tenancy documents of the infamous L-18 Batla House
 isi ghar main aatif ke netritv main aatankwaadiyon kaa giroh rahata tha
 The thick handcuffs in Rahman's hands are seen to be weighing a lot for his lean physique
 uskaa kad chota he, sharir dublaa, lambaai 5 foot 5 inch, or chehre par khiz kaa bhav he, or andeh kaa bhi lekin donon bhav ek saath nahin aate
 He has little concern for his future, nor does he regret the deaths at his hands a week ago
 uski tikhi, chaudee ankhen aadhi khuli hai
 It is very difficult to peek into them
 usne kaale rang kii pant pahani he or kaaphi badi halki kameez, jo uske sharir par qamar se neeche tak jhulati hui najar aa rahi he
 His voice is irritated and the whole personality unfriendly
 iske baavjood jab vah bolnaa shuru karata he to mere andar bhay kii siharan daud jaati he
 i ask, "you put the bomb?" "yes," he answers and tries to open his half-eyed
 ''tumhaare dost nisaar kaa kahana he ki aatif ne allaah ke naam par uskaa beja istemaal kiya
 "when i try to scrape him, he leans to the side that his family will not listen and responds," Everything i know about Islam, and what i know about this world i understand something, then only i can say that i have no regrets for what i did
 ''to yadi tum giraftaar na hue hote to apni yojana ke mutabik nehru place main bhi tumne bam rakh die hote
 "without hesitation he replies," Yes
 '' uski choti kaaya kadi ho jaati he or duble haathon kii nasen tan jaati hai
 He declares, "it is jihad in the name of Allah
" '' meraa aglaa sawaal, ''tumhaara dushman koun he?'' vah bhavaviheen-sa rata hua jawaab detaa he, ''yah allaah ke liye jihad he, takadir waalon ko hi iskaa mauka miltaa he
 "then i ask him," "but who is this jihad against Allah?" He looks for words to describe his enemy
 ek vishesh dharm kaa anuyaayi hone ke kaaran apamaanit kiye jane kii gahari jad jamaa chuki bhaavana main uske amoort-aakaarahin dushman kii avadharana vilupt ho jaati he
 He says with a little hesitation, "it (jihad) is against Maharashtra for ignoring the Srikrishna Commission report, against what happened in Gujarat
" ''lekin dilli ke karol baag main logon kii maut, gujarat yaa maharashtra main logon par nishaanaa saadhane main kaise madad kar sakati he? yah sawaal use uttejit kar detaa he, uskaa gussa bhadak uthta he
 Raising his hand to stop me from speaking, he says, "I don't regret what i did, and the way i did it
" unase kahie ki mujhe goli maar den
 "his thin lips clench
 is samay uski dubli, saadhaaran-si dikhti kaaya behad khatarnaak or daraavnee najar aane lagati he-ek jinda bam kii tarah
 i then ask, "how many more people like you are ready to kill people in the name of Jihad?" "I only know Shakeel and Nisar
" aatif ab jinda nahin he
 There are some more people, '' he replies
 thodaa ruk kar, ''jihad main shaamil hone ko hajaaron log taiyaar hai
 "and tell me something about the Indian Mujahideen?" "I only know about Atif
" ''thodaa or kuredne ke iraade se main poochta hum, ''tum ahmedabad kab gaye the? yah jaanane kii koshish nahin kii ki tumhaari yatra kaa kharch kisne uthaaya?'' vah jawaab detaa he, ''main jaanata tha ki ek udaaramana vyakti he, vah allaah ko pyaar karne vaala he or har sambhav tareeke se hamaari madad kar rahaa he
 "" Your parents knew about this? "" His blunt reply, "" You know now
 '' phir kahata he, ''mere pita mujhase naaraaz hai
 He told me that i am not his son
 ve allaah ke liye is jihad ko samaj nahin pate, mere liye koi or cheez myne nahin rakhti
 "would he like to place a bomb in the market where his mother buys greens?" He then goes into silence
 phir uske dimag main kuch sujhata he to vah jawaab detaa he, ''yadi allaah yahi chahta he to main aisa karuunga
 My father will have heaven '' is aavesh main vah ek bhaavanahin, vivekahin mashin najar aa rahaa he, jise narsanhaar ke liye hi taiyaar kiya gaya he, vah bhi allaah ke naam par
 Even more frightening is that many more like him would be sitting ready
 saaqib nisaar, 23jamiya millia islamia kaa graduate, ab sikkim manipal uniwarsity se management kaa course kar rahaa he
 He is accused that he was involved in the survey team before placing the bomb in Ghaffar Market
 saaqib nisaar ke haath main hathkadi he
 a policeman is sitting next to him
 vah charhara, gora, sundar yuvak he
 Big, stirring eyes
 neend na le paane kii vajah se uskaa cheharaa thakaa hua lag rahaa he
 She is wearing a properly fitting blue jeans and a loose-fitting shirt with red and white stripes looks hanging on her lean body
 kai ghanton tak police kii poochtacha ke baavjood vah baat karne ko utsuk dikhataa he
 On seeing him, he realizes that he belongs to a rich family
 main usase poochta hum, ''tumhen pataa he, tumne kya kiya he?'' vah sthir rahata he
 Head bowed, no movement
 maano usne sawaal suna hi nahin
 Then after a long silence he raises his head and gives a short answer, "yes
 '' ''tumne bam kahaan rakhaa tha?'' ''seepi (conot place) main
 '' 'where in CP?' '' Regal Cinema
 '' uski aawaaj ab oonchi or spasht hoti jaati he
 "you knew it was a bomb
" or isse begunaahon kii jaan chali jaaegi?'' upar dekhte hue vah kahata he, ''allaah ke liye
 This is Jihad for Allah
 '' uski ankhen nam ho jaati hai, lekin unamem pashchaatap nahin he
 He reveals his background openly
 vah dilli kaa rahane vaala he, azamgarh kaa nahin
 He did his schooling from Delhi itself
 haal hi main jamiya millia se usne grajuation kiya he- raajnneeti vigyaan, arthshaastra or islamic studies main, or achche number hasil kiye hai
 "the total numbers for all three years are 56 per cent," he says proudly
 haalanki jihad se pare bhi uskaa jivan tha- ek ladki thi, jo dost se badhkar kuch thi, or ve sab apekshaayen jo is umr ke yuvaaon ke liye aam hoti hai- achche kapade, ladkiyaan or atyaadhunik sazosaman
 But he confesses that this lifestyle was to cover his true passion — in the name of Allah and jihad for Allah
 vah kahata he, ''apni vah dost or vah jindagi mujhe yaad nahin aati he
 "he is surprised how the police caught him so soon
" ''ham ek chaatr kaa saamaanya jivan jite hai, jis par shaq kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin rah jaati
 "he also adds that he thought he would never be caught," i have no criminal history
 ''jihad to uske liye ek anshkalik gatividhi hi thi, jise vah behad gambhirtha se anjaam detaa tha
 He used to meet like-minded people in college and out of college and discussed the need for jihad, the nature of jihad, to avenge the excesses and insults that happened to Muslims
 bina kisi laag-lapet ke nisaar kahata he, ''bharat main musalmaan hona behad kathinaaiyon bharaa he
 "but until four years ago, he had never thought that he would ever become a jihadi
" chaar saal pehle apane rishte ke bhai shaadaab ke ghar vah pehali baar aatif se mila tha (aatif kii maut 19 sitambar 2008 ko muthbhed main hui thi)
 After this Atif became a friend, guide and leader of Shakeel, Nisar, Rahman and other gang youth
 dilli police kaa kahana he ki dilli bam visphoton kii sajeesh usee ne rachi thi
 These people used to move around together
 aatif ke saath apane shuruaati sampark ko yaad karte vah kahata he, ''aatif jab jihad kii baat karata to hamen bahut acha lagata tha
 Atif used to come first to meet Nisar with Shadab, later he started coming alone
 nisaar bataata he, ''aatif ne hi mujhe bataaya ki kuch hi logon ko allaah ke naam par jihad karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 He would spend hours jihad
 ise lekar usamen bahut junun tha, vahi junun usne mujhamen bhar diya
 "nisar states that it took him some time to become fully initiated into jihad
 aatif ne use aisa urdu sahitya padhane kii salaah di jisamen se adhiktar islam ke dushmano ke khilaaf bahaduree bhari ladaai ke bare main tha
 Nisar specifically mentions one book - that is, the book Maidan, which details the struggle of Afghan Muslims against Soviet occupation in the 1980s
 is pustak ne nisaar par gaharaa asar choda
 He says, "it is written in the book that Allah always helps the true jihadi
 or main is par yakeen karata hum
 "nisar insists on listening to an episode of the book
 yah kissa ek nihathe jihadi kaa he, jise afghanistan ke marusthal main roosi tinkon ne gher liya tha
 Desperate to save his life, the jihadist lifted a handful of sand from the ground and gave it to the tanks, and the sand turned into a powerful bomb and blew out the Soviet tanks, "allah would even perform miracles to save the true jihadi
" Yes, this is very true
 '' yah kehete hue nisaar kii palken nahin jhapakatin, is kapol kalpit kisse ke ek-ek shabd par use yakeen he
 He recalls that Atif had been assessing his tenacity and courage to become a jihadi for several months
 nisaar bataata he, ''kai saalon tak usne apane asli iraade, jo kaam mujhe asal main karnaa he, ke bare main kuch nahin bataaya
 He wanted to be assured that i would be able to do that
 main to hameshaa se hi jaanata tha ki mujhamen jihad kii jwaala bhari he
 Atif first introduced his interpretation of jihad when he inadvertently explained how he had planted bombs at the Sankatmochan temple in Varanasi a few years earlier
 aatif ne nisaar ko graph ke jariye bataaya ki kis tarah usne mandir parisar main ek-ek ped ke nikat bam rakhaa, jahaan chaar jode shaadi kar rahe the
 Nisar says, "I was shaken badly
" aatif logon kii hatya kar rahaa he
 "but Atif said the big motive behind this bloody game," Sometimes such a path has to be adopted to eradicate great evil
 yah mere yaa tumhaare liye nahin he, yah to allaah ke liye he
 Atif explained to Nisar
 apane gut main ek sachche jihadi ke rup main apana sikaa jamaane kaa pehla mauka bhi nisaar ko mil gaya
 He was also among a group of 12 people who went to bomb in Ahmedabad
 yah kaam usne bina kisi naa-nukar ke or safaltaapurvak kar diya
 Nisar says, "after that we started meeting very often
 ham or jihad karne ko aatur the
 i was closer to Atif, Jia and Shadab
 aatif mujhe pasand karata tha
 He was very impressed with my knowledge of Delhi
 ''aglaa mauka 13 sitambar ko aayaa
 Atif that day was very concerned about our safety
 '' nisaar isaki vajah bhi bataata he, ''us din usne hamen koi pahchaan patr nahin le jane diya
 Not even a mobile phone
 '' nisaar ko bataaya gaya ki aatif ne unki nahin balki apni suraksha ke liye aisa kiya tha
 "so did Atif use Nisar in the name of Allah?" Nisar's thinking is clear
 ''usne visphot ke baad ek baar bhi mujhe phone nahin kiya
 He also did not insist that i attend a meeting on L-18 (hideout of terrorists) after the blast
 ''ab tak nasir baichaiyn ho uthta he
 "what will these people do to me?" He means the police
 main use yaad dilaataa hum, ''tumhen pataa he, tum kitne khatarnaak ho gaye ho?'' uski ankhon main aansu bhar aate hai or vah chat kii taraf dekhne lagata he
 i ask, "you have thought about your parents, what must have been happening to them?" He weeps quietly
 in jihadiyon main vahi ek akelaa he, jise yah ehsaas hua or jhatka laga he ki vah kya kar baitha he
 Perhaps Nisar is not as staunch jihadist as he wants to present himself
 mohammad shakeel, 26,jamiya millia islamia main arthshaastra kaa antim varsh kaa chaatr
 He is accused of planting bombs in Ahmedabad and Delhi's Karol Bagh
 dakshin dilli jila police ke samvaadadaata sammelan main vah tivi camaron ke saamne pesh kiye jane ke intjaar main he
 At the moment his face is covered
 uske parivaar kaa ek sadsy uske saath he
 And some of his friends too, who have come to take the risk
 uskaa cheharaa dhakaa hua he
 i ask, "tell me something about yourself
 '' mere sawaal ko khaarij karte hue vah kahata he, ''main pulisavaalon ko yah kai baar bataa chukaa hum
 "then, correcting his voice, says almost apologetically," Sir, ask what you want to know
 allaah ke karam se main to ek khuli kitaab hum
 "he tells me that he loves life, and he wants to enjoy it to the fullest
" lekin vah jivan izzat kaa jivan hona chahie, ''yadi aap vah sab dekhen jo duniya main ho rahaa he, or bharat main bhi ho rahaa he to paaenge ki musalamaanon ko pasand nahin kiya jaataa
 "there are only two options before us - live a life of contempt, bear insults and abuses or protest in the name of Allah
" maine doosraa vikalp chunaa kyonki yah sirf mere liye hota to koi baat nahin thi
 It is in the name of Allah, whom they want to discredit and it is not acceptable
 ''usamen aise vichaar bharne main aatif kaa haath tha
 Shakeel says, "after giving my life to Allah, i felt a new life inside me
 ab mujhe kisi baat se dar nahin lagata
 For me, life and death are the same
 '' use yah kabool karne main jaraa bhi hichak nahin he ki ahmedabad main usne bam rakhe the
 He says, "I put the parcel in Maninagar
 aatif ke thikaane par niyamit rup se jane vaala shakeel apane saath ahmedabad jane vaale logon ke naam ginaata he-nisaar kaa rishte kaa bhai shaadaab, sajid or khalid (ye sab bhaag chuke hai)
 Apart from these, Zia-ur Rehman and Atif
 ye sab aatif ke ghar niyamit rup se jate the
 He explains, "this was the most obsessive phase of our lives together
 hamaare liye kuch bhi myne nahin rakhata tha
 There was no ego clash in us, we could do anything for Allah
 ''giroh main aati
 Shakeel was second only after F
 to isamen jaraa bhi hairat nahin ki gaffaar market main bam rakhane ke liye vah aatif ke saath gaya tha
 Shakeel says, "we are all equal in Jihad for the sake of Allah
" lekin main allaah ke bande se adhik samay tak judaa rahaa
 He was happy with the way the accidents were happening
 allaah ke mutthi bhar bande mahanagaron par nishaanaa saadh kar itane bade desh ke aarthik jivan ko pangu kar daalate hai or koi kuch nahin kar paata
 We are giving them what we are getting from them
 ''lekin nisaar kii tarah vah bhi itani jaldi pakade jane se hairaan he
 "atif used to say that no one can touch us
 ham to allaah ke liye hai
 "he remembers," Shakeel has passed, we are here
 hamen koi afsos nahin he
 Allah is testing our courage
 '' police ke paas saboot hai
 "they have recovered the bucket in which we used to keep gunpowder, plastic tape, timer watches and our own use bags
" '' begunaah logon ko maarane kaa use jaraa bhi afsos nahin he
 He is not a leader, just a follower, a novice, who has not yet understood the true but frightening meaning of jihad
 vah unamem se he, jinhen aatankwaadi hone main jaraa bhi jhijak nahin he, ''jaisaaki maine aapako bataaya, hamaare paas chhipaane ko kuch nahin he
 We are not thieves
 '' yah bebaak bayani use or khatarnaak bana detii he

 However, the people on the set understood that it is many times more difficult to do than the flying kick that they see

 It will be called coincidence that five-six books related to travel memoirs in Hindi have come at a time when the Hindi society is celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Rahul Sanskritayan
 unase bada yaayavar hindi kii duniya main nahin hua
 Among the writers who enriched the travelogue in Hindi are Benipuri, Dinkar, Agnayya, Nirmal Verma, Prabhakar Machwe and Srikanth Varma, after Sanskritayana
 saanskrityaayan ke baad agyeya kii pahchaan ek yaayavar lekhak ke rup main hui
 Later, Ajit Kumar, Krishna Nath and Amrit Lal Vegad also wrote important travelogues
 lekin hindi aalochana main yatra sansmaran ko gambhirtha se nahin liye jane or mukhyadhara kii vidha main shaamil nahin kiye jane ke kaaran bahut kam lekhak hi is vidha kii ore aakrisht hue
 In the history of the Sahitya Akademi's 64-year history, no Hindi writer has received any award for travel memoirs and the least research work in the world of universities would have been on this mode
 par in taaja paanch kitabon se hindi kaa yatra sahitya samrudh hoga
 Panchrang and five visions are also working in these books
 pehali kitaab hindi ke aalochak or dilli vishvavidhyalay main shikshak dow
 Vinod Tiwari, the second book is the well-known Hindi story writer Pratyaksha, the third is by young poet Yashaswini Pandey, the fourth is by young writer journalist Shrikant Dubey and the fifth by Sunil Kumar, a researcher
 vinod tiwari kii pustak nazim hikmat ke desh main unke turki pravaas par likhi gai he
 a few years ago, the famous Hindi writer playwright Asghar Wajahat had also worked under the scheme of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to teach Hindi to students during his stay abroad and wrote his travel memoirs
 vinod tiwari ne usee yojana ke tahat apane turki pravaas par yah kitaab likhi he
 Pratyaksha is such a Hindi storyteller who has been traveling abroad and abroad
 unke kuch yatra sansmaran patr-patrikaon main chape hai
 His book Taimur is Your Horse Where is a collection of travel memoirs
 isi tarah yashaswini pandeya kii kitaab unki desh bhar kii yatraaon ke dauraan likhe gaye yatra sansmaranon kaa sangrah he or yah kitaab rashtriya pustak nyaas dwaara yuva lekhikaon kii mahila shashaktikaran yojana ke tahat prakashit he
 The final book is a collection of India's Northeast research articles in Hindi travel literature, outlining the contribution of various Hindi writers to the Northeast Travel Memoirs
 in kitabon main sarvaadhik kendrit kitaab vinod tiwari kii he
 He has included diaries, sketches and cultural criticism along with travel memoirs in this book
 is lihaaj se is kitaab kaa mahatv adhik ho jaataa he or iskaa rang bhi anya pustakon se alag he
 Vinod Tiwari himself is a mature critic and a serious reader of literature from India and abroad
 unke paas ek aitihaasik drushti bhi he
 Therefore, reading his book also provides a critical history about Turkey
 hindi main turki ke bare main kam hi likhaa gaya he par najim hikmat ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa gaya he
 They are popular among Hindi readers like Pablo Neruda and Breshet and are the world's biggest icons of resistance culture
 tiwari ne is pustak main turki ke itihaas, uski bhashaa, bhugol or samskruti ko sametane kii koshish kii he
 In the beginning of the book, after the details of the beginning of his journey, he has told about the life of Kamal Ataturk and his personality who is the father of the nation
 tiwari ne turki main tagore kii lokapriyata ke bare main likhaa he
 His memoir shows that Gandhi and Tagore are highly respected in that country
 gitanjali kaa turki main anuwaad 1941 main hi ho gaya tha or tagore ke naam par sadaken tathaa pratimaa bhi he
 But his book does not reveal the reaction of Ghalib to the intellectual society there
 tiwari kaa sabase sundar lekh mullah nasruddin par he
 The book has a very important article on Nazim Hikmat
 darasal vinod tiwari apane sansmaranon main vaicharik lekh kii gandh bhi daal dete hai
 He has also discussed Islamic socialism and the Turkish crisis
 hindi main yatra sansmaran jyadatar purushon ne hi likhe hai
 But when a writer writes a memoir, it is different from men
 pratyaksha ek kathakaar hai
 Therefore, he has written his memoir in a constructive way
 usamen kathatatv bhi he
 There is a dispatch in his language
 ve keval suchanaaen yaa byore nahin deteen
 Nirmalji remembers reading his memoirs
 pratyaksha apane yatra sansmaranon main objrbar adhik he
 His style, language and craft are interesting
 yashaswini kii kitaab padhakar lagata he ki ve yaayavar prakruti kii hai
 She captures scenes, places, people's lives, culture, religious customs like a camera and gives details of the journey where she goes, which gives a lot of information to the general readers and the journey in her mind Interest is generated towards desh main paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye aisi kitabon kii adhik jarurat he jisase logon ko apane desh ke paryaton sthalon kii jhalak mil sake
 Like Yashaswini, Srikanth Dubey is making his mark in the world of literature by leaving a town like Gorakhpur
 unki kitaab mexico par kendrit he
 Marx is synonymous with Mexico
 shrikant ne un par ek acha sansmaran likhaa he
 Apart from this, brief history and life of that country is also highlighted
 lekin unke vivaran bahut lambey hai
 Sunil's book is a good book to understand Northeast India
 hindi main purvottar par bahut kam likhaa gaya he or vahaan ke jivan or samskruti ke bare main kam charchaa hui he
 This book of Sunil is notable from this point of view
 unhone hindi ke yatra vrittantkaron kii bhi paryaapt charchaa kii he
 Thus, on the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Rahul Sanskritayan, these writers have given him a creative tribute and enriched this genre
 *** The Akhilesh era has started in the Samajwadi Party
 mulaayam kheme ne puri tarah apni haar sweekaar kar lee he
 SP now has only one survey
 
 
 akhilesh yadav
 Now the party will have what they want
 buudhvaar shaam apane chahete yuva saathiyon kii 'ghar vaapasi' kaa aadesh de unhone yah baat saaf bhi kar di he
 It is now being hoped that while all Akhilesh camp leaders will be promoted, there will be some leaders who can also be demoted
 akhilesh ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad amar singh ne apana paksh saaf kar diya he ki ve akhilesh ko aashirwad or salaah to de sakate hai lekin unke saath kaam nahin kar sakate
 It is certain that there may be some cuts in the jurisdiction of some leaders who are loyal to the Mulayam camp
 aaie aise 5 netaaon ke bare main aapako bataate hai jo samaajawaadee dangal main mulaayam ke saath the lekin pasa palatney ke baad abhi shant hai
 Shivpal Yadavamulayam Singh Yadav's younger brother
 akhilesh gut se sidhi takkar inhone hi lee thi
 They were the biggest losers in the entire development
 chunaav ayog ke faisle ke baad se shant, philhal sapa main mahaj ek kaaryakarta kii bhoomika main
 Mulayam Singh has his name from Jaswantnagar seat in the final list of 38 people (let me tell you that Shivpal was not named before, although his son Aditya Yadav was named)
 buudhvaar ko shivpal ne media main itnaa jarur kaha ki, "haa, main chunaav laduunga
 "his supporters in the party have converged in Jaswantnagar
 unki koshish he ki is baar chunaav main sabase badi jeet jaswantnagar seat se shivpal yadav kii hi ho
 Let us tell you that Jaswantnagar is the traditional seat of SP
 yah seat mulaayam singh yadav se pehle unke guru rahe natthuram ke naam thi
 In 1967, Mulayam reached the assembly by winning this seat for the first time
 mulaayam singh ke baad 1996 se ab tak yah seat shivpal yadav ke paas he
 Shivpal has been an MLA for four consecutive terms from here
 2012 ke chunaavon main shivpal ne jaswantnagar seat se 81 hajaar se adhik voton se jeet darj kii thi
 Shivpal got a total of 1,33,563 votes in the elections, while second-ranked BSP candidate Manish Yadav got only 52,479 votes
 benny prasad varmamulaayam ke khaas rahe
 These Kurmi leaders, who have joined the Congress for not agreeing to the desired things, are once again standing with Mulayam
 congress main jane ke baad benny ne mulaayam ke khilaaf tamaam baaten kahin lekin uttar pradesh main kurmi vot ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mulaayam ne or congress main apana bhavishya na dekh benny ne puraani baaten bisar phir se nai shuruyaat kii he
 But, after the socialist riots, Beni's stakes once again seem to be upside down
 vivaad ke daur main mulaayam ke kheme main khadey benny nikhileshko manaane kii koshish to kii thi lekin media main tikat ko lekar kuch baaten bhi kahi thim
 Let me tell you here that Beni Prasad said that, "you cannot please everyone in the election
 " benny ko yah baat isliye bolni padi kyonki ve mulaayam-shivpal se apane bete rakesh verma ke liye tikat le chuke the
 Beni's son Rakesh Verma has been given ticket from Ramnagar seat in Barabanki district
 yah tikat akhilesh ke kareebi mantri arvind singh gop ke naam tha
 Now obviously Rakesh Verma's ticket in the new Sultanate may be cut (let me tell you that Gop may not be promoting in Ramnagar, but his public relations is going on continuously)
 benny bhale hi rajyasabha pahunch chuke hon lekin sanghathan main unki koi bhoomika hogi aisa mushkil hi lagata he
 Ambika Chaudhary Ambika Chaudhary was sacked as the Revenue Minister
 shivpal ke khaas netaa, vivaad ke daur main lagaataar mulaayam kheme main hi najar aae
 It is clear that his rights will be limited in the Akhilesh era
 choudhary par jameen hathiyaane kaa maamla kai baar uth chukaa he
 While being a minister in the state government, the issue of occupying land has been raised in the Legislative Assembly of Ambika Chaudhary in his ancestral village, Kapuri, after the people got the raw and pucca houses installed by the government bulldozers
 iske alaava gaanv ke talab ko patwakar apane rishtedaaron ko jameen aavantit karwaane kaa bhi aarope lag chukaa he
 Chaudhary, who was also the Revenue Minister in the Mulayam government, is also accused that he had allegedly allotted 9 acres of land in Lucknow's Chinhat area in the name of his wife in a fake way, the matter has also come up during the Question Hour in the Assembly
 gayatri prajapatkhilesh ne sabase zyada baar apane cabinet se kisi mantri ko nikaala he to ve hai amethi se vidhayak gayatri prasad prajapati
 Let me tell you that in 2002, the person who lived below the poverty line had a BPL card, today he is a millionaire
 gayatri ke upar lokayukta kii bhi najar he
 He is accused of using his Department of Coal and Mining to earn a lot of wealth
 mulaayam ke khaas or unke duusare bete pratik yadav ke kareebi gayatri prajapati se akhilesh ke rishte zyada madhur nahin rahe hai
 Under Mulayam's pressure, Akhilesh had given him the post of minister again, but now it seems difficult to happen again
 aashu malikspa kaa nayaa muslim cheharaa banane kaa sapana sanjoe emelsi aashu malik mulaayam kheme main khadey najar aae
 Ashu Malik is such a leader of the Mulayam camp with whom Akhilesh has a relationship like Amar Singh
 aashu or amar ke khilaaf akhilesh ke tevar rajat jayanti samaaroh or apatkaaleen adhiveshan main saamne aa chukaa he
 According to media reports, Akhilesh also pushed Ashu Malik from the stage during the silver jubilee celebrations
 iske alaava yah bhi khabaren ai thim ki aashu malik ke saath akhilesh samarthak (khaskar van mantri pawan pandey) ne hathapayee bhi kii thi
 Let me tell you that Akhilesh was angry with Malik due to an article published in a newspaper, he had mentioned this thing many times in his speech
 ab jaahir he ki sapa main tej raftaar se aage bad rahe aashu malik kii gati kuch kam hogi
 Ashu's speed can be gauged from the fact that he started his political journey in 2010 and became MLC in 2015
 2011 main aashu malik sapa sarkaar ke prachaarak banaae gaye the
 He participated in several big rallies in 2012 and 2014 elections and was seen standing with Akhilesh
 lekin, akhbaar main chape ek artical ne unke kiye sabhi kaamon par pani pher diya
 However, Ashu Malik has given his clarification in that matter
 26 / 11 ke master mind aatanki haafiz said ke saath manch saajhne karne ke baad jammu kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaa yaccin malik kii chautarafa ninda ho rahi he
 According to reports quoting the Home Ministry sources, the government is considering canceling the passport of Kashmir's separatist Netasin Malik
 bharat lautne ke baad unase poochtacha bhi karegi
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded Yasin Malik's arrest along with the seizure of his passport
 bijepi pravaktaa prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ko turant hi malik kaa passport jabt kar lenaa chahie or use giraftaar karnaa chahie
 Prakash Javadekar said that Congress and the government should answer why Yasin Malik was allowed to go to Pakistan
 vahiin rashtriya swayamsevi sangh ne bhi yaccin malik par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The RSS leader said that the Hurriyat Conference and Yasin Malik have also been involved in anti-national activities in the past
 hurriyat algaavvaadi samarthak or aatankwaadi samarthak sanghathan he
 The government should take action against them
 ram madhav ne kaha, 'sirf passport jabt karne se kaam nahin chalegaa
 More concrete action must be taken so that a strong message goes
 'shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki yah raashtra virdohi gatividhi he, is kanoon ke tahat yaccin malik ke khilaaf maamla darj hona chahie
 Congress leader Jagdambika Pal also lambasted Yasin Malik, saying that despite being an Indian, Yasin Malik shared the stage with terrorist Hafiz Saeed, it should be investigated
 jagdambika paal ne kaha ki malik hameshaa se raashtra virdohi gatividhiyon main lipt rahe hai
 We should also object to the Government of Pakistan in this matter
 gauratlab he kiyasin malik jab islamabad main afjal guru kii faansee ke khilaaf bhukh hadtaal par baithe to mumbai hamale kaa sargana hafiz said bhi vahaan maujuud tha
 The demand for stern action against Yasin Malik has increased after this picture surfaced
 salmaan khan kii film bharat ko relies hone main ab mahaj 24 ghante kaa vakt bhi nahin bachaa he
 As the film's reversal of the release is starting, Salman's magic is speaking to the fans
 salmaan ke mumbai main rahane vaale ek fain ne apane hero kaa pramotion alag tareeke se karne kaa bidaa uthaa liya he
 According to a report by Deccan Chronicle, an auto rickshaw driver from Mumbai has made the ride free for those going to see the film India
 is free ride kaa laabh bharat film ke tikat dikhaakar uthaa sakate hai
 Like an auto driver, a restaurant owner in Mumbai named his restaurant after the film Bharat

 com / am9azahlfn Former England wicketkeeper Paul Nixon has raised a controversy, describing the last match played between India and Pakistan as a fix
 2-0 se pichad rahaa bharat siries ke is antim match main bahut kam score karne ke baad bhi jeet gaya tha
 Nixon said that it was not a big deal for the series-occupied Pakistani team to win the two matches and deliberately lose the final match
 nicksan ne kaha ki antim match main 167 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi pakistan kii team ke ballebaajon ne jaanboojhkar apane wicket ganvaae
 He said this while tweeting
 42 varshiya paul ne twit par likhaa ki yah match nahin majaak ban gaya he
 Questioning Hafeez's shot selection, Nixon said that after the player is deployed at the leg slip, does the batsman play sweep shot? Perhaps a bookie has asked Hafeez to play this shot
 isse pehle captain misbah-ul-haq bhi leg slip par kaich thama baithe the
 There has been a shadow of match fixing in the past on indo-pak crowns
 haal hi main england ek cricket lekhak ne daawa kiya tha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich pichley varsh mohali main khelaa gaya vishwacap semifinal fiks tha or is baat kii jaankaree use ek sattebaaj se mili thi
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in Parliament on Tuesday that his government had nothing to hide in relation to the coal scam and the so-called missing files related to the CBI (central Bureau of Investigation) investigation were being searched

 All sides made their point
 maamla nichali adaalat se haai court tak pahunch gaya
 Many of the victims also passed away in the meantime
 lekin phir bhi unhen jo cheez nahin mil pai vah he insaaf
 The Patna High Court's decision to acquit all the accused in the sixteen year old Bathani Tola massacre case has broken the back of the victims of this scandal
 ve apane parivaar kii khushiyon ko luutane waalon kii sajaa kii aas lagaae baithe the
 But the High Court has released 23 accused for lack of evidence
kisun Choudhary is jansanhaar ke shikayatakarta kisun choudhary ko is faisle kaa malaal he
 Kisun's wife Sundari Devi and two innocent daughters were killed in the incident
 ghatana ke paanch saal baad kisun ne duusari shaadi kar lee thi
 But the streaks of that day's pain can still be seen on his face
 ve kehete hai, ''rajnatik kaarnon se aropiyon ke khilaaf court main paryaapt subut pesh nahin ho sake jiskaa phayda aropiyon ko mila
 "but their hopes have not broken yet," my legal battle will continue till the killer is punished so that the souls of those who die will be at peace
 ''kisun akele nahin hai, jinhen aropiyon ke bari ho jane kaa malaal he
 Marwadi Chaudhary is also distressed, whose wife, daughter-in-law and grandson were murdered
 marwari or unka iklauta putr mithilesh isliye batch gaye the kyonki ghatana ke samay ve ghar se baahar the
 Marwadi's house had become a witness to that heart-breaking incident where the villagers tried to hide
 lekin aparaadhiyon ne unke ghar main aag laga di thi
 After that those who came out of the house were shot and killed
 ghar ke kivaad main lagi goliyon ke nishaan aaj bhi hai, jo har roj ghatana kii yaad taaja kar jate hai
 Marwaris do not want their son to see such a wretched day, so they live in the village only
 marwari kehete hai, ''ham chaahate hai ki hatyaron ko sajaa mili, taaki unhen bhi apane gunaah kaa kuch ehsaas ho sake
 Better than me, there was Lalmuni Ram of our village, who died before hearing the news of the acquittal of the accused
 ''yah ghatana us samay kii he ki jab lalu prasad bihar ke mukhyamantri hua karte the or rajya main varchasv kii ladaai ko lekar khooni sangharsh ufaan par tha
 The incident of Bathani Tola of Sahar police station in Bhojpur district on July 11, 1996, is a link to the same bloody struggle in which 21 innocent innocents from 11 families were brutally murdered
 is ghatana main teen maah se 70 saal tak umr ke logon kii hatya kar di gai thi, jisamen 11 mahilaayein, 9 bachche or ek purush shaamil tha
 Ranvir Sena was accused of genocide
 12 may, 2010 ko aara ke edisnal district and seshan jaj ajay kumaar shrivastav ne 20 ko umrakaid or teen ko faansee kii sajaa sunai thi
 But on 16 April 2012, the Patna High Court acquitted all of them because the charge was not proved
 nyaayamurti navniti prasad singh or nyaayamurti ashvini kumaar singh kii do sadasyeey khandpeeth ne aadesh main kaha he ki abhiyojan paksh (sarkari paksh) aarope pramanit karne main asafal rahaa
 The involvement of the accused in this case could not be proved
 beshak kanoon kaa faisla jo ho lekin is narsanhaar ke ghaav jhelane vaale palaton ram kehete hai, ''police kii bhoomika shuru se hi sandigdh rahi he
 Completed the investigation of such a big incident in four years
 '' jabaki teen saal kii umr main apni maa ko kho chuke 19 varshiya rajkumaar choudhary kii ankhen aaj bhi chhalchala jaati hai
 He says, "I don't say that my mother has been killed by people acquitted by the court
" par main jaananaa chahta hum ki aakhir kisne meri maa ko maaraa
 Whose task is it to find the culprit and punish him? Whoever the killer was, he should be sentenced to death
 ''is ghatana main apane parivaar ke chah sadasyon ko kho chuke naimuddin bhi court ke faisle se aahat hai
 Naeem has been living in Ara since this incident
 naeem khijkar itnaa hi kehete hai, ''katl karanevaala kanoon se bhale hi batch gaya ho, lekin allaah uske gunahon kii sajaa jarur degaa
 "on the other hand, after this decision of the High Court, the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar said," The state government will move the Supreme Court in the Bathani Tola massacre case
 '' jabaki vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa rashtriya janata dal ke abdul baari siddiki ne kaha ki sarkaar hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf supreme court jaae to uski monitering bhi kii jaae
 Here, CPI-ML state secretary Kunal has accused the state government of conspiracy
 unka kahana he ki rajya sarkaar kii sajeesh ke kaaran peediton ko nyaay nahin mil paaya he
 Here the important question arises not on the decision of the court, but on the role of prosecution and police, whose criminals have been taking advantage of their shortcomings
 hycourt ne police jaanch par hi sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha he ki jisane yah sab kiya, unke khilaaf sahi dhang se jaanch nahin kii gai
 The investigation seems to have been conducted in a particular direction, which was beyond the truth and under suspicion
 bathani tolaa jansanhaar maamle main police ne 62 logon ke khilaaf court main chargeshit daakhil kii thi, jisamen 53 logon ke khilaaf sunwaayee hui
 The trial court acquitted 30 accused for lack of evidence and sentenced 23
 jinhen patna hycourt se raahat mil gai he
 Although 11 families of Bathani Tola have got government jobs and compensation as per the announcement, but is it enough? The decision of Bathani Tola massacre is a warning to the government
 patna hycourt kaa yah nirnay sarkaar kii un kamiyon ko ujagar karata he, jinke chalate aaropee bachate rahe hai
 Now the government has to decide what steps it takes in such a case so that the victims can get justice

 1995 main shankar singh waghela ne jab baghawat kii thi, to us kathin daur main anandiben or modi ne saath-saath party ke liye kaam kiya tha
 His image is completely impeccable so far and he lacks experience either
 1998 main cabinet main aane ke baad se ve shiksha or mahila evam bal kalyaan jaise mantralayon kaa jimmaa sambhaal chuki hai
 Anandi, who was awarded the gallantry award in 1987, is seen as a strong leader in the Legislative Assembly of Gujarat, Anandiben and always outshines the opposition
 unki sabase badi yogyata yah he ki ve nidar or saahsee hai
 In 1987, she jumped into the lake to save a student from drowning, for which she was also awarded the Bravery Award from the state
 party ke sutron ke mutabik unamem ek hi kami he ki “ve hansmukh nahin hai
 And the party does not treat friendly workers

 i should judge by my actions, not by my face

 The two leaders of India and Pakistan are expected to meet at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on June 15 in the city of Yekaterinburg, central Russia
 is tarah gat varsh mumbai ke aatankwaadi hamalon ke baad singh or jaradaari ke bich pehali mulaakaat hone kii sambhaavna he
 Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said in his weekly press statement that no formal meeting between the two was scheduled
 yah poochne par ki kya vah jaradaari or singh ke bich baithak kii sambhaavna ko khaarij karte hai basit ne kaha ki vah yah nahin kah rahe hai ki ve ek kamare main nahin honge
 Basit welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's remark that if Pakistan takes stern action against terrorists, then it is ready to step up on its behalf
 basit ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti prakriya jari rahani chaiye kyonki yah kshetra kii shanti tathaa suraksha ke liye jaruri he
 He said that Pakistan sincerely wants the stalled dialogue process to be restored as much as possible and he hopes that the talks will resume once again
 america ne donon deshon ke bich vaarta bahaali par jor diya he
 India stopped this dialogue which started in 2004 after the Mumbai attacks of 26 November and has blamed Pakistan-based elements including lashkar-e-taiba for the attacks
 bharat ne vaarta bahaali ko hamalon ke shadyantrkariyon ke khilaaf pakistan ke karrwai karne se joda he
 On a question related to addressing India's concerns, Basit said that Pakistan is committed to bring the perpetrators of this malicious act to justice and not to leave any effort in this direction
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kaa yah maananaa he ki aatankwaad or ugravadi hinsa jaise masalon ko baatcheet ke jariye hi suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Basit also said that Pakistan wishes that India should provide all the evidence and information related to the attacks at one go
 gat 20 may ko bharat kii muhaiyaa karaayi gayi jaankaree alag-alag bhashaaon main he or ab ise angreji anuwaad ke saath diya gaya he
 Pakistan is now waiting for the remaining material
 unhone kaha yah darshata he ki donon paksh sahyog kar rahe hai or aage badhane ke bare main unka najariya rachanaatmak he
 It also underscores that bilateral cooperation is very important, otherwise it would be difficult to resolve all these issues
 basit ne kaha ki kashmir ke lambit mudde ko shantipurna tareeke or baatcheet se hal karne ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he
 Whenever the composite dialogue process is restored, it should be durable and result-oriented
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki sabhi desh bharat or pakistan ke mitra hai or vaarta prakriya kii bahaali main donon deshon kii madad karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 He dismissed reports that Pakistan's President Zardari's close aide Salman Farooqui's appointment as Pakistan's chief negotiator for the second round of talks with India was not correct

 rahul ne aage kaha, 'hamaari arthvyavastha bahut mehnat se aage bad rahi he, lekin ham rojgaar paidaa nahin kar paa rahe
 This is because those who are skilled, who have skills, do not have capital
 ye dikkat isliye he ki badi maatra main paisa 15 se 20 logon ke paas ja rahaa he

 Talking about Neha, she is currently taking a break from TV and spending time with her daughter
 bataa den ki neha ab tak kai tivi shoj main najar aa chuki hai
 These include Bitti Business Wali, Gulal, Baby Shower, Love Marriage or Orange Marriage, Dev Mahadev of Devo, Tu Mera Hero and Threshold
 lekin neha ko pahchaan serial bahu hamaari rajnikant se mili
 It is said that until the goal is set, the destination is not found
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki desh kii maujuuda raajnneeti ke sabase bade chanakya kahe jane vaale bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah hameshaa chunavi mishan main dikhaai dete hai
 Although all political parties and their leaders go to the election summer with a lot of strategy, but Alexander is called the winner
 saal 2017 desh kii chunavi raajnneeti ke lihaaz se behad khaas rahaa
 The country got new presidents and vice presidents, a total of 7 states, including Uttar Pradesh, had assembly elections
 kai suubon main sthaneey chunaav bhi sampann hue
 By December, the command of the 132-year-old Congress Party of the country was handed over to 47-year-old Gandhi
 rahul kii tajposhi ke kuch ghanton baad hi gujarat or himachal pradesh main congress party ko paraajay kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 In this way, another head of victory was tied to Amit Shah's head and the color of Rahul getting the throne faded
 2017 ke sabase bade siyaasi chehre ke rup main amit shah or rahul main kisne apana prabhaav choda, iske liye saal ke bade siyaasi parvon kaa aankalan jaruri he, jinaki shuruyaat farvari-march main hui
 The first quarter of the year saw a big reversal in the country's political figures
 uttar pradesh, punjab, uttarakhand, goa or manipur main vidhansabha chunaav hue
 In UP and Uttarakhand, the Bharatiya Janata Party got a thumping majority
 raajnneetik rup se desh ke sabase bade soobe upi ke nateezon ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 The party won 313 seats in the 403 seats in the assembly on its own and the figure rose to 325, including the seats of the constituents
 upi kii jeet kai myanon main bijepi ke liye ahm rahi
 In fact, after 17 years, the BJP got the distinction of reaching the pinnacle of power, where the legendary leaders like former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Rajnath Singh and Kalyan Singh were connected
 upi ke siem rahe rajnath singh dilli pahunchakar bijepi ke sarvocch pad rashtriya adhyaksh tak pahunch gaye, lekin bijepi upi main mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party or mulaayam singh yadav kii samaajawaadee party kaa varchasv todane main safalataa praapt nahin kar pai
 But when Amit Shah, who came from Gujarat, as the party president, contested the 2017 elections, he transformed the BJP
 unhone na keval ground level tak party kaaryakartaaon ko janata ke bich utaara, balki har mumkin siyaasi pintara apanaaya
 Worked to create a vote bank by joining small parties together
 jiskaa nateeja ye hua ki 17 saal ke siyaasi vanvaas ke baad bijepi ko upi par shashan karne kaa mauka mila
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi as Congress vice-president also played a very big political bet to win UP and took Akhilesh Yadav's hand in alliance with the Samajwadi Party
 upi ke in do ladakon ne soobe kii janata ko yuva netritv or vikaas kii nai soch ke naam par aakarshith karne kii purajor koshish kii
 The pair of two young leaders became very noisy, but Akhilesh, who distributed the laptop, was disappointed as a return gift
 vahiin unke saath gathbandhan main chunaav ladane vaale rahul kii congress mahaj 6 fisadi voton par simat gai or isse ek zyada yani saat siton par party pratyaashiyon ko jeet mili
 The UP election results for Rahul and Congress also came as a big shock because this land has been the work place of his father, mother, grandmother Indira and his father Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 magar, rahul kaa koi asar najar nahin aayaa or wo flop maane gaye
 Apart from this, in Uttarakhand, the BJP overthrew the Congress and formed the government with an absolute majority
 goa or manipur main bijepi ko congress se kam siten praapt huin, lekin amit shah ne donon rajyon main sarkaar banane kaa daawa thok diya or raaton-raat apana vaada nibhaakar bhi dikhaa diya
 Despite emerging as the single largest party in both the states, the Congress could not form the government there and the BJP took over the chair
 haalanki, punjab main jarur congress ko jabardast jeet mili or bijepi kii gathbandhan party shiromani akali dal ko satta se bedakhal hona padaa
 But in this victory of Congress, Captain Amarinder Singh got credit instead of Rahul
 punjab main bijepi kaa apana utana damakham nahin he, aise main yahaan na amit shah kii haar maani gai or na hi rahul kii jeet
 After these elections, there was a political upheaval in the presidential election as well
 bijepi ne bihar ke governor ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya or ek dalit chehre ke rup main unki branding hui
 Reversing this stance of PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, the Congress declared the Dalit-female face as Meera Kumar its candidate
 haalanki, is chunaav main endie ummidavaar kii jeet sunishchit thi, baavjood iske congress or rahul gandhi raashtrapati chunaav main vipakshi ekta ko purna rup se sanvaarane main safal nahin ho paae
 But on the other hand, BJP and Amit Shah threw the dice of the biggest vicissitudes of power in Bihar from this election
 congress or argedy ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar chal rahe nitish kumaar ne bihar ke rajyapal rahe ramnath kovind ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 The result of this whole exercise was that Nitish Kumar disbanded the grand alliance through which he had gained power in Bihar and formed the government with the help of BJP
 rahul gandhi bihar main apane sahyogiyon ko ekajute rakhane main naakaamayaab rahe or amit shah ne ek or rajya main apni party kii sarkaar banane kaa record bana diya
 After Bihar, Amit Shah thrashed the Congress in Delhi
 2015 main jis rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko aam aadmi party jaisi nai naveli party se karaari shikast mili thi, vahaan emsidi chunaav main amit shah ne puri takat jhonk di
 The result was that the Congress, which ruled Delhi for 15 years before the Aam Aadmi Party government, failed to save its base and the BJP in all three municipal corporations played a role
 is tarah rahul gandhi ek ke baad ek har morche par fail hote gaye
 Now on the one hand, preparations were on to make Rahul Gandhi the president in the Congress, on the other hand he had assembly elections in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh
 sabase badi chunauti gujarat main thi
 Rahul also accepted this challenge and went into the battle of Gujarat with full preparation
 yahaan rahul kaa badla rup najar aayaa
 Political analysts started calling him a mature leader
 rahul negujarat navasarjan yatrake naam par rajya main daure kiye
 The journey started from Dwarkadhish Temple
 yatraaon main tikaa lagaakar bhaashan die, jise congress kaa soft hindutv kii taraf jhukaav mana gaya
 In the absence of strong local leadership, Rahul kept going among the people of Gujarat on his own
 patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakur or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ko saath laane kaa kaam kiya
 On the other hand, PM Modi and Amit Shah threw full force into their home state
 kendriya mantrimandal se lekar party kaa laav lashkar gujarat main utar aayaa, baavjood iske rahul bijepi ke liye chunauti ban gaye
 Rahul did the job of taking the Gujarat election to a thorny contest, but he failed to form a Congress party government
 is tarah rahul kii haar kaa aankada or bad gaya
 At the same time, under the leadership of Amit Shah, the BJP once again occupied the power of Gujarat after 22 years
 himachal pradesh main amit shah ne rahul gandhi kii mehnat ko dharaashai kar diya
 BJP saffron map of the country and form its government in 19 states
 is tarah amit shah ke sir jeet kaa ek or sehara bandha gaya
 At the same time, Rahul remained under the leadership of another defeat of the Congress under his leadership

 Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay issued a charge sheet against Kejriwal
 paanch binduon vaali chargeshit par kai aarope lagaae hai
 These are 5 major allegations against Kejriwal of BJP
 
 
 1
 The AAP government had promised to protect women, but failed to protect women workers of its party
 2
 Kejriwal falsely promised cheap electricity free water
 lekin logon ko iskaa koi phayda nahin mila, jisase dilli kaa kaaphi nuksaan hua he, khud ke mantri or vidhayak farjivade main fanse
 3
 kejariwal ne araajaktaa failaai hai
 The quarrel and confrontation with the Center broke the dignity of the Constitution
 kaamkaaj thapp hua or adhikariyon ke transfar par jhooth bolaa
 4
 kejariwal or unke vidhayakon ne dharmik unmaad failaayaa
 Amanatullah and Naresh Yadav are accused of inciting religious sentiments
 5
 They used to oppose corruption but now their own government is surrounded by scams
 tanker ghotaalaa, pyaaz ghotaalaa, auto permit ghotaalaa, sienji ghotaalaa, vigyaapan ghotaalaa, premium bas ghotaalaa, jaisi tamaam gadabadiyaan saamne ai hai
 BJP is now seeking an answer from Kejriwal on this charge sheet and also demanding resignation, BJP has said that it will go to the public about this charge sheet and will protest on the streets

 Because the roads on which the relief and rescue operations were carried out last time will not be able to bear the brunt of nature at this time
 aapako shaayad andaja bhi na ho ki srinagar se gauri kund tak sadak banane kaa jimmaa sarkaar ne jis company ko diya he, usne saaf kah diya he ki maujuuda sadaken mahaj do yaa teen barish kii mehmaan hai
 Because they have worked the way they have been asked to complete the work quickly
 senior ejeeniyar ke es mehta kehete hai, 'sadaken surakshit nahin he
 The danger is greater on the roads
 'itane lambe root kii sadak itane kam samay main banate dekh sthaneey log bhi hairaan hai
 People say that the road work is being done at war level, but the ground reality is that all this is being done in a hurry while neither the work nor the standards are being done properly
 agar ek bhi barish ai to sab kuch bah jaayegaa

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is trying to make Ganga's avidity a big issue
 is vishay ko lekar rajya sarkaar 25 or 26 farvari 2017 ko ek antarrashtriya sammelan karne ja rahi he
 The main thing will be kept in it that the avidity of the Ganges will be maintained only when a barrage is not built on it
 farkka bairaj kaa virodhrajya sarkaar is mudde ko bada banaate hue farkka bairaj kaa virodh karegi

 In 2016, due to Farakka barrage, the river Ganges took a gigantic form
 lakhon log bihar main ganga main ai baadh se behaal ho gaye the
 At that time, Nitish Kumar had alleged that siltation is occurring in the Ganges river due to Farakka barrage, the depth is decreasing due to silt deposition in the river and that is why it is taking the form of flood
 unhone centre sarkaar kaa dhyaan is ore aakrisht karaayaa tha
 Challenges will be given to Namami Gange
 The Bihar government had requested the central government to decam the Farakka barrage and formulate a national silt management policy
 lekin centre kii taraf se koi khaas pahal abhi tak nahin hui
 That's why Nitish Kumar is going to start the program about the avidity of Ganga, which can challenge the Prime Minister's Namami Gange
 donon ke kaaryakramon main buniyadi fark ye he ki narendra modi namaami gange se ganga ko svachh banane main jute hai tonithish kumaraka tark he jab tak ganga aviral nahin hogi tab tak swatchta kaise aegi

 gujarat siem narendra modi ke daavon par virdohi akasar sawaal uthaate rahete hai
 Now through the information received from RTI, the Gujarat Parivartan Party has started convincing Modi
 mudda bana he sadbhaavna upwas ke dauraan gujarat ke vibhinn jilon ke liye special package kaa elaan, jisaki phooti kaudi ab tak kahin nahin pahunchi he
 Through RTI documents, Govardhan Jhappia, leader of Gujarat Parivartan Party, has come forward to prove Narendra Modi as a throwaway
 jhadpia ke mutabik sadbhaavna upwas ke dauraan modi ne gujarat ke har jile main vikaas ke liye special package kaa elaan kiya tha, lekin artiai se ye chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he ki kisi jile ko special package mila hi nahin
 It is worth mentioning that during the Sadbhavna fast, Modi has given a special package of 2380 crores for Sabarkantha, 1004 crores for Amreli, 1583 crores for Dahod, 2500 crores for Mehsana, 281 crores for Porbandar, 3500 crores for Jamnagar
 Declared kul milakar modi ne us vakt 39,769 karod ke special vikaas package kii ghoshnaa apane sadbhaavna manch se kii thi
 When Aaj Tak wanted to know the side of the Gujarat government in this matter, the government clearly said that it was not a special package
 ye vahi rakam thi jo jilon ko anudaan main diya jaataa he
 That is, it means that Modi tried to rob the applause by renaming the old fund
 artiai se sadbhaavna upwas par pani kii tarah paisa bahaane kaa bhi khulaasa hua he
 According to the information received from RTI, it has cost about eight and a half crore rupees to bring people from the village to Sadbhavana Manch, in every district, it cost about Rs 45 crores for the platform
 govardhan jhadpia ne kaha, '2001 main jab se gujarat main wo sarkaar main aaye hai, agar aap party kaa menithesto bhi dekhen to usamen bhi kai aise bade-bade shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he jo aam insaan ki samaj ke hi baahar rahete hai, jo ghoshnaa hoti he wo praja ko maaloom hi nahin hoti he
 It is so clear that whatever name was given to him through social media is absolutely correct

 But the children have nothing to do with expensive or cheap, they see the thing and insist on buying the bus
 thodaa sabar karen, agle saal yani pehali janvari se aapako cinema haul ke andar man markar movie nahin dekhni hogi
 Because the government has announced a ban on double MRP from January 1

 On the discussions about the future candidates for the post of Prime Minister, he quipped, "why limit the scope of the claim
" congress kii taraf se rahul gandhi ke saath hi digvijay singh or eke antni kii daavedaari par bhi vichaar kyon na ho

 dilli sarkaar ne janata ko raahat dete hue 1 janvari 2014 se 20, 000 litre muft pani kaa elaan kiya he
 For this, it is mandatory for the houses to have a water meter in working condition
 lekin isse ek litre bhi istemaal kiya to aapako puraa bill bharna hoga
 But even if these conditions are set aside, the Aam Aadmi Party has shown some stinginess in implementing its manifesto
 khud aam aadmi party ne ghoshnaptr banaate vakt dilli main 33
 5 lakh consuming households were assessed and based on the World Health Organization's standards, that 150 liters of water per person is sufficient for a respectable life
 isi aadhaar par aap ne ek parivaar main paanch sadasyon kaa maanak banaaya tha, jiske mutabik prati parivaar 750 litre kii chhot banati thi
 But in the manifesto, the party promised to provide 700 liters of water for the project
 lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar par hui lambii baithak ke baad 20 hajaar litre pani prati maah muft dene kaa elaan ho gaya
 That is, in the 31-month month January, March, May July, August, October and December, now only 645 per family
 16 litre pani hi prati din muft mil paaegaa
 While 666 in April, June, September, November, 30-day months including February
 66 litre pani mil paaegaa
 That is, if the government wants free water, then for seven months in a year, a family will have to live in less than six and a half hundred liters, while the remaining five months will get 21 liters more water
 haalanki aam aadmi party ne apane ghoshnaptr main kaha tha- sarkaar kii jimmedaari hogi ki 700 litre pratidin tak pani istemaal karne vaale jalmitra pariwaron ko pani muft uplabdh karaayegi
 The family that will use more water than this will be billed for it
 ek hajaar litre pratidin se zyada pani istemaal karne waalon par mahangi daren lagu kii jaaengi
 The motive behind this promise of AAP is to promote fair use of water

 saurav ganguli pichley kuch dinon se surkhiyon main rahe hai lekin yah cricket kii vajah se nahin he
 Recently, there were reports that how BJP first through Varun Gandhi, then Congress Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Bhattacharya reached Saurav with the request of his party to contest elections
 haalanki, saurav ne is par koi tippanee nahin kii or isaki vajah se is par charchaa kaa bazaar garm rahaa
 a source close to Sourav said that despite the offers of these two political parties, they have no plans to join any party
 unhone kaha, ‘haa unhen donon partiyon ne ofer diya he, lekin abhi wo politics main nahin janaa chaahate hai
 i cannot explain why this is so
 lekin, pichley kuch saalon main unhen dekhakar to lagata he ki agar wo is maamle main aage janaa chahenge or raajnneeti main shaamil hote hai to unki congress se zyada bijepi main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he
 According to a close source, Sourav is still silent on this because he wants to meet BJP leader Arun Jaitley and let him know about his involvement in BJP, he does not want him to get this from the media
 dekha gaya he ki ganguli ke parivaar kaa jhukaav vam dal sipiem kii taraf rahaa he lekin ganguli kii nishtha unamem nahin he
 The source informed that Ganguly has a soft attitude towards CPM, this is wrong
 web siries :mirzapurkalakaar :pankaj treepathi, ali fazal, divyendu sharma, vikrant maisi, kulbhushan kharbanda, rajesh tailang, shriya pilganvkar, rasika duggal, shiba chaddha, shubhrajyoti bharat or anya
 Director: Gurmeet Singh, Karan Anshuman (review of the web series Mirzapur in three parts
 pehle hisse main mirzapur shahar,siries kii kahani or duusari baaten yahaan clic kar pard sakate hai
 The third part is below
 )abhinay ke lihaaj se mirzapur badhiya web siries he
 The work of many artists is shocking
 khaskar ali fazal or divyendu sharma kaa abhinay
 If Mirzapur is remembered for his work, nothing wrong will happen
 web siries main guddu pandit ke rup main ali fazal kaa luk kahani or kirdaar ke mutabik hi he
 He is very innocent and straightforward, shy, shy with girls and is full of childish pimples
 uske sapane ek ausat bachche kii tarah hai
 When does he think he will get rid of the bicycle? The title of Mr
 Purvanchal is for him to achieve the greatest achievement of his life
 lekin uske andar ajeeb si bechaini bhi he
 Seeing him, he does not know how in a moment he escapes from one world to another
 bina baat logon kii jaan lene vaala guddu pandit, sweety ke saamne nervas ho jaataa he, apane dil kii baat nahin bol paata
 The father quarrels but the mother does not know how much love is in her chest
 jaise wo sara shahar maa ke liye khareednaa chahta he
 He wants the whole city to respect his mother
 krime ke vakt wo itnaa krur najar aata he ki kai seens main use dekhnaa dar ko mahasoos karnaa he
 However, for the most part, he appears in the same mood, which looks like jerk in fully evoking his character
 haalanki yah galati ali fazal kii nahin he
 He has lived with full vigor like the story and scenes he got
 bablu pandit ke kirdaar main vikrant maisi bhi janche hai
 His eyes are hesitant, afraid and angry according to the character
 unhen kahani main jitna spes mila use badhiya kar gaye hai
 People will be surprised to see Divyendu playing every color of the character as Jiyamunna Tripathi
 munna had tak krur or vyabhichaari he jo ghar kii naukaraani par havas mitaatha he
 Like he wants to crush every sound rising against him in bed in Mirzapur
 wo itnaa aattaayi he ki juute par peshaab kaa chhinta padane bhar se kisi ko bhi bedardi se marava detaa he
 Even to become King of Mirzapur, he has no hesitation in killing his father
 lekin dil uske andar bhi he
 When his closest friend is caught trying to murder the father and he has to kill the friend himself, Munna breaks down
 divyendu ne is seen main kamaal kii acting kii hai
 Munna's character Divyendu has tried to show all the colors
 shubhrajyoti sabase parfectorati ke rup main shubhrajyoti kaa kirdaar bhale hi chota he par abhinay, sthaneey samvaad or luk ke maamle main wo siries main sabase parfect dikhte hai
 That is why in every scene, they are quite well-behaved
 unhen dekhakar ek pal bhi nahin lagata ki rati, mirzapur yaa jonpur kaa mafia nahin hai
 Rasika Duggal has also done a good job as the second trouble of the carpet brother
 haalanki rasika ke kirdaar kii kuntha pehle sijan main puri tarah ubhar kar saamne nahin aa paati
 While she is troubled by her husband's masculinity, to her satisfaction, she has to have an illicit relationship with a servant from home
 jo naukaraani radhika se munna treepathi ke purushatv ke kisse sunakar trupt hona chaahati he
 Apart from Rasika, the character of Sheesha Chadha, Sweety (shriya), Golu and Dimpy (harshita Gaur) in Vasudha's character are also good
 makabool, kinnar, yadav ji, gupta ji, espi maurya, radhiya or duusare tamaam kirdaar nibhaane vaale kalakaaron kaa kaam bhi apni jagah thik thaak hi he
 But there are many characters who could not reach the height in the story, the way their character was initially entered
 shuruyaat main ye kirdaar kaaleen bhaiya ke baraabar lag rahaa tha
 But the bullying of the character Ramakant Pandit (rajesh Telang) in the later story is weak and misleading
 kai baar unki maujuudagi nirarthak si he
 Kulbhushan Kharbanda's work should also be praised for this series
 jabaki unke hisse sabase kam samvaad aae hai, lekin unhone pairon se laachaar, behad jativaadee paurush par ghamand karne vaale buudhe mafia kaa kirdaar bahut hi shiddat se nibhaayaa he
 The way they take advantage of daughter-in-law Bina's immoral relationship and rape her, the way the servants get Raja punished, they are disgusted by her character
 yah kulbhushan ke abhinay kii apni oonchai he
 Creating Pankaj's character is now the responsibility of the directors? Pankaj Tripathi is an important character in the series
 ye unke liye sochane kaa vakt bhi he
 He is getting typed into certain roles, especially in the role of a mafia or father
 mirzapur main bhi kai jagah wo "bareli kii barfi" ke pita vaale kirdaar main najar aate hai
 Just don't smile
 to kuch seens main "gudgaanv" ke mafia
 They have to get out of this slot
 agar mirzapur main dekhen to pankaj kaa kirdaar aakiri episod ke us seen main adaayagi ke lihaaj se bahut oonchai par najar aata he, jahaan wo police afasar maurya ke saath samvaad karte hai
 It is obvious that while writing, filming Pankaj's character, the responsibility of the writer and director increases how he is able to get this amazing actor out of his old grooves
 kai seens main kaaleen bhaiya ke rup main pankaj kaa luk or samvaad adaayagi unheen ke puraane kirdaaron kii yaad dilaa jaataa he
 The directors should work according to the character of Pankaj on his look
 samiksha ke tisare hisse menyaha padhein mirzapur main kahaan kahaan huichook
 
 
 
 dilli main sarkarein or agenciyaan kai project par kaam nahin kar paane ke liye fund kii kami kaa ronaa roti rahi hai, lekin sieji kii ore se saal 2016-17 ko lekar jo report pesh kii gai he, uske aankade hairaan karne vaale hai
 Thousands of crores were kept for many proposals and could not be spent
 saal 2016-17 main kharch karne ke liedilli sarkaarne kul 47,429 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan rakhaa, lekin saal khatm hote hote mahaj 37,620 karod hi kharch ho paaya yani 9,800 karod se zyada kii raashi kharch hi nahin ho sakaa
 In 2015-16 too, the government was able to spend less than the allocated budget
 uske paas kharch ke liye 41,129 karod rupee aavantit the, lekin 37,690 karod hi kharch ho sake or 3,164 karod kii raashi bina kharch ke hi padi rah gai
 119 project did not spend money, so many aspects have been touched in the CAG report, but what is most shocking is that there are 119 heads within 8 departments where funds of one crore or more are fixed in the budget
 Despite doing it, a single penny could not be spent
 in 119 project main sabase zyada bajet vaale project kii baat karen to ditisi ke bason kii kharid, ditisi or cluster bason main sisitivi lagane kaa praavdhaan, mohalla suraksha dal kii sthapana jaisi kai ahm skim bhi shaamil hai
 a provision of Rs 150 crore was made for the purchase of DTC buses, but not a single penny was spent
 ditisi bason or cluster bason main sisitivi camera lagane ke liye 90 karod rakhe gaye, lekin kharch kuch bhi nahin hua
 Similarly, in the Mohalla Raksha Dal, i
e
, every locality, Rs 200 crore was kept for providing security in addition to the police, but the work could not start there
 inke alaava dilli jalboard ko interceptor siver ke liye 200 karod die gaye the lekin vahaan bhi kaam thap padaa rahaa
 The PWD could not even afford the expense, that Rs 100 crore was given for maintenance and maintenance of PWD roads in Delhi, a large part of which could not be spent
 siejine apni report main ye bhi bataaya he ki 44 head main jahaan 10 karod se zyada kaa fund diya gaya tha vahaan 2,200 karod rupee se zyada kaa fund bina kharch kiye hi rah gaya
 If we look at the departments, 137 crore in education, 321 crore in health services, 342 crore in development department and about 1,380 crore in urban development department had to surrender at the end of the year
 baat sirf yaheen tak nahin he balki jab sarkaar ko ye lagane laga ki saal khatm hone tak fund kaa istemaal nahin ho paa rahaa he to saal ke aakhri teen maheenon main kharch ne achaanak raftaar pakad lee
 In the last quarter of the year i
e
 three months, there were 44 heads in which the fund was spent from 54% to 100% of the entire budget
 aise project jahaan 50 karod se zyada fund kharch nahin ho paaya1

 rajasthan main ab bina colector kii anumati ke dharm parivartan nahin hoga
 This decision has been given by the Rajasthan High Court to overcome cases like love jihad
 rajasthan hoicourt jodhpur ke jaj gopalkrushan ne lav jihad ke ek maamle main faisla sunaate hue kaha ki jab tak rajya main dharm parivartan se sambandhit koi kanoon nahin ban jaae tabatak hoicourt kaa ye nirdesh lagu rahegaa
 In Jodhpur, a family accused a Muslim boy of forcibly converting his girl and marrying her, alleging Nelvjihadi
 tab hoicourt ne ladki ko sarkari nari niketan main bhejte hue rajya sarkaar se kaha tha ki kisi ke liye bhi dharm parivartan karnaa majaak ban gaya he
 What are your rules for this? rajya sarkaar ne court ko jawaab diya tha ki usne vidheyak bana liya he jisaki manjuuri ke liye grahamantralay ke jarie raashtrapati ko bheja he
 In that case the girl said that she is marrying on her own free will and does not want to interfere

 bhaajapa ne apane 2014 ke chunaav ghoshnaptr main bhi ek saath chunaav karaane kii baat kahi thi
 The government has since sought opinion on the issue from the Law Commission, Election Commission and Parliamentary Select Committee
 in sansthaaon main vichaar-vimarsh ke baad iske samarthan main ye daleelein ubhariah 1
 Having separate elections costs heavily
 2
 Implementation of the code of conduct impairs policies
 3
 Implementation of essential services is affected
 4
 The functioning of other offices is affected due to the required workforce
 aaie, ham pehle inhen muddon kii jaanch-parakh karte hai or inhen kasautiyon par kasate hai
 One, the expenditure on elections includes government expenditure to get it done and political parties and candidates during campaigning
 duusare, sirf nai yojanaon ke elaan par hi roak hoti he, taaki votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish na kii ja sake
 Then, schemes of immediate importance in the public interest can be announced with the permission of the Election Commission
 tisare, yah sahi nahin he ki saamaanya sevaaon par amal baadhit ho jaataa he
 The Election Commission takes care that staff of essential services are not put in election duty
 chauthe, jila prashasan jarur prabhavit hota he kyonki chunaav praathmik kaary ho jaataa he
 The services of most teachers are used to conduct elections, so this affects the normal school activity
 sansadeey pravar samiti ke bataae in chaar muddon ke alaava koi yah bhi gina saktaa he ki chunaavon ke dauraan jatvaad, sampradayikta or bhrashtachar bhi bulandi chune lagata he
 But at the same time, the arguments of not holding elections are also less strong
 ek, loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon kii avadhi mote taur par aasapaas nahin rahati
 So far, 16 Lok Sabha seats have been dissolved before seven periods
 idhar kuch samay se vidhansabhaayen amuman aapnaa kaarykaal puraa kar paa rahi hai to uskaa shrey 1985 ke dalbadal virdohi kanoon or anuchhed 356 ke istemaal par supreme court ke faislon or sakht rukh ko diya ja saktaa he
 Again, leaders face more accountability than facing voters more than once in five years
 isse netaaon or rajnatik partiyon ko janata ke sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Thirdly, during the elections many types of jobs are created, which gives a boost to the local economy
 chathe, nijee tathaa saarvajanik sampattiyon ko badrang na karne, shor or vaayu pradooshan par niyantran, plastic par pratibandh jaise niyam-kaayadon par sakhti se amal ke kaaran paryaavaran bhi behatar hota he
 Fifth, as a precautionary measure by the Election Commission, crime rates decline, such as the confiscation of illegal arms operations, licensed weapons are also stored and pending non-bailable warrants are implemented
 aakhir main, sthaneey or rashtriya mudde alag-alag rahete hai
 These facts are not weighty in any sense
 jahaan tak chunaav ayog kii baat he to yakeenan vah paanch saal main ek baar saath-saath chunaav karaane se khush hi hoga or kai charnon ke badale ek hi din main vah kaam puraa kar legaa
 This will reduce the burden on him
 haalanki vah iske liye jaruri vyavasthaaon or vittiya aavashyaktaaon kii baat pehle hi kar chukaa he, khaskar yah ki atirikt voting mashin kii jarurat padegi
 However, there are real legal and constitutional issues that make simultaneous elections impossible and until a consensus is reached between political parties, we must curb the expenses of political parties to reduce expenditure
 pradhanmantri ne chunaav ayog ko sarvanumati ke liye baithak bulaane kaa suzav diya he lekin agar ve khud aisi baithak bulaate hai to vah zyada kargar hogi
 My opinion is that this problem has not been considered until its logical end

 assam kii ghatana ne insaaniyat ko to sharmasaar kiya hi, yah sawaal bhi uthaaya he ki kya hamaari sarkarein vaaki mahilaon kii hifaazat ko lekar gambhir hai? san 1990 main sansad ne ek adhinium banaakar desh main isiilie alag se mahila ayog kaa gathan kiya tha ki auraton ke haq kii ladaai ko or bal mili
 It was expected that the Commission would be represented by women who fought a long battle for women's rights, but the ground reality is that the Women's Commission has remained a government platform to empower women activists associated with the ruling party
 maujuuda mahila ayog ke dhaanche par najar daalen ton mamata sharma adhyaksh or vaansuk siem, dow
 Charu Valikhanna, Mamta Kheria, Shamina Shafiq and Nirmala Sawant Prabhavalkar are its members
 in chah logon main se chaar sidhe-sidhe congress se judi rahi netaa hai or mahila sangharsh ke naam par unki ladaai party ke mahila prakoshthon kaa netritv karne tak simit rahi he
 Commission chairperson Mamta Sharma entered Rajasthan politics in 1985
 ve lambey samay tak rajasthan congress kii mahasachiv raheen
 Twice she was a Congress MLA from Bundi assembly
 lekin jab ve 2008 main vidhansabha kaa chunaav haar gayi or mahaj rajasthan pradesh mahila congress kii adhyaksh hi rah gayi to unke liye nai kursi kii talash kii gai
 It is believed that Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi helped him in getting the Women's Commission
 yani congress ne apni vafaadaar netaa ko mahila ayog pahunchaakar upakrit kar diya
 c On the question whether recruiting leaders instead of professional women mobilizers does not affect the efficiency of the commission, Mamta said, "no, it is not
 chaaru or hemlata jaisi sadasyon kaa congress se koi vaasta nahin he
 But you should not forget that the ruling party at the center has been making appointments on its own
 endie sarkaar ne bhi to bhaajapa netaa poornima adwani ko adhyaksh banaaya tha
 "and after that Congress had handed over the throne of the Women's Commission to Girija Vyas, who had lost the Lok Sabha elections from Rajasthan itself
 assam kii ghatana ne insaaniyat ko to sharmasaar kiya hi, yah sawaal bhi uthaaya he ki kya hamaari sarkarein vaaki mahilaon kii hifaazat ko lekar gambhir hai? san 1990 main sansad ne ek adhinium banaakar desh main isiilie alag se mahila ayog kaa gathan kiya tha ki auraton ke haq kii ladaai ko or bal mili
 Apart from Mamta, Siem, who is heading the commission team to investigate the Guwahati incident, is also a three-decade old activist of Congress
 siem ne bataaya, ''main meghalaya main enesuai or yuva kangeras kii sakriy kaaryakarta rahi
 Was the General Secretary of the State Congress for 15 years
 iske alaava rashtriya str par party kii mahila shakha kii upaadhyaksh bhi rahi

 Among the members, Charu Valikhanna is the only one who has a good record of fighting for women's rights
 aise main sawaal yah he ki saal ke pehle chah maheene main hi 8,975 shikaayatein darj kar chukaa mahila ayog kya apane maujuuda raajnneetik dhaanche main peediton ko raahat dilaa paaegaa yaa phir isamen nai urja bharne kii darkaar he
 Two gunmen opened fire in front of a mosque in the southern French city of Avignon
 is firing main aath log ghayal ho gaye
 Presently, the police did not describe the incident as a terrorist attack and described it as a case of mutual enmity
 bataa den ki aath ghayal logon main se do logon ko ghatana ke baad aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 According to the source, the people leaving the mosque were not its intended target
 laa provence riginal newspaper ke mutabik, jisane pehali baar is ghatana kii soochna di thi, ne nyaayik strot kaa hawala dete hue kaha tha ki police ise aatankwaad se nahin jod rahi he or unka kahana he ki ho saktaa he ki ye yuvaaon ke bich kaa ek vivaad ho saktaa he
 The newspaper quoted witnesses as saying that one of the two gunmen covering the face was shot at 10:30 pm
 log jab tak masjid se baahar aate isse pehle ki donon vahaan se bhaag gaye
 La Provence reported that four people were injured outside the mosque, while their apartment was fifty meters (yards) from there
 yah ghatana tab saamne ai jab masjid ke saamne ek vyakti bheed main se car ko chalaane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Who was arrested lekin is ghatana main koi bhi ghayal nahin hua tha
 France is on high security alert after the terrorist attacks in recent years
 trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee ne loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko epadiai ke mudde par samprag sarkaar kii 35 maton ke antar se jeet par tippanee karte hue kaha ki yah alpamat sarkaar he

 They should get a fresh mandate from the public
 ’’ In a comment on Facebook, Mamta said, "it's embarrassing
" aaj janadesh sabit karata he ki samprag-2 sarkaar alpamat sarkaar he
 In spite of all the efforts of selfish people, instead of the majority figure of 271 based on the total strength of the house, only 253 members got support
 ’’ He said, "the government has lost its credibility
 unhen janata se nae sire se janadesh hasil karnaa chahie

 enditivi ke madhyavadhi chunaav survey 2012 ke mutabik 40 fisadi logon kii pasand ke saath upi main akhilesh yadav number ek par hai
 They are followed by Uma Bharti, Mayawati, Mulayam Singh and Salman Khurshid
 lekin, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki akhilesh kii chintaaen khatm ho gayi
 39 percent believe that Akhilesh Yadav's work so far is worse than expected
 40 fisadi log maanate hai ki ummid ke mutabik he jabaki 21 fisadi hi maanate hai ki unhone ummid se behatar kaam kiya he
 Despite this, if the Lok Sabha mid-term elections are held today, Akhilesh and Mulayam's dominance in UP will not decrease but will increase
 enditivi madhyavadhi survey 2012 ke mutabik samaajawaadee party 2009 kii 23 loksabhaa siton se badhkar 33 par pahunch jaaegi jabaki congress 26 se ghatakar 17 par aa jaaegi bispi 20 se 15 par pahunch jaaegi jabaki bijepi ko thodaa faaydaa hoga vah 10 se 14 par pahunch jaaegi
 Not only this, the estimate says that Samajwadi Party will become the third largest party in the Lok Sabha with 33 seats
 saafe he ki jald madhyavadhi chunaav hue to vah samaajawaadee party ke liye mufid sabit honge
 By the way, Mulayam Singh Yadav himself has often asked his party people to prepare for the mid-term elections
 ab baat karte hai pashchim bengal, kerala or assam ke bare main logon kaa kya kahana he

 If the mid-term elections to the Lok Sabha are held today, the Congress's tally on 14 seats in Assam will be reduced from seven to six, while the BJP will remain on four
 agypi kii seat ek se badhkar do ho jaaengi
 Overall, till now the medium-term survey of NDTV is showing that if the Lok Sabha elections are held in today's situation, the Congress will suffer badly
 NDTV ke opinian pole main yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki log congress main rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri ke pad ke liye behatar ummidavaar maanate hai

 pole ke parinaam ke anusaar modi ko 42%, adwani ko 23% or sushamaa ko 20% log pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Now tell you how many people like Narendra Modi in which state - he is the most popular in Gujarat (85%) and Rajasthan (62%) and the least popular are Odisha (27%) and Bihar (31 Per cent)

 The government says that there are 20 lakh farmers under its purview but many farmers still allege that they have not got the benefit of loan waiver
 agar-malwa main harinarayan apni bees bigha pushtaini jameen par kheti karte hai
 4 from government bank for fertilizer, seeds and medicine
 5 lakh rupye kaa karj liya tha
 Kamal Nath government's announcement of debt waiver was expected to make life better with debt waiver but neither the loan waiver certificate came nor the money in the account
 parinarayan bataate hai, 'bank main aisi koi soochna nahin he ki meraa karjmaaf hua he, mere naam se saadhe chaar lakh kaa karj he
 No loan waiver certificate has been received
 hamen bahut ummid thi lekin sarkaar khara nahin utari
 'A few kilometers from the district headquarters, Pappu Lal's trouble in Deepu village is slightly different from Harinarayan
 pappu laal bataate hai ki unhone sahakaari socity se 3
 Had taken a loan of 16 thousand for 5 bigha land
 ab monsoon ko dekhte hue buaai karne ke liye sarkari karjamaafee ke bharose khaad beej udhaar lene bank pahunch gaye
 When we arrived here, it was found that the loan waiver was not done
 On the contrary, due to not repaying the loan of sixteen thousand, penalty was imposed
 mukhyamantri ke grih jile ke kisaan bhi karj maafee ke naam par khud ko thaga mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Kamal Nath has also distributed loan waiver certificates to the farmers, but farmers troubled by debt are still shedding tears
 kharif kii buvaai shuru hone vaali he, kisaan samitiyon main khaad beej lene ke liye pahunch rahe hai to unhen purana karj bakaayaa hone ke chalate khaad-beej nahin mil rahaa he, jisaki vajah se kisaan ke saamne sankat khadaa ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, the government has now started work on waiving loans ranging from 50 thousand to one lakh rupees in the second phase of Jai Kisan loan waiver scheme
 tay kiya gaya ki chaalu khate main ab 50 hajaar se adhik ke karjadaar kisaanon ko laabh diya jaae
 In this, those farmers will be the first to have a single bank account on an Aadhaar card
 is aadhaar par duusare charan main kareeb nau lakh kisaanon ko phayda milegaa
 Agriculture Minister Sachin Yadav said that in the second phase, farmers who have a current account loan of up to 50,000-1 lakhs will work to give the benefit of loan waiver
 sachin ne kaha ki pehali praathamikta unako denge jinka single khaataa he, multiple khate kaa nirdhaaran aane vaale vakt main karenge
 The BJP is saying that the government has only manipulated the farmers
 bijepi vidhayak or purv mantri vishwaas saarang ne kaha pehle to karjmaaf nahin kiya
 56000 crores was to be forgiven
 bajet main keval 5000 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya
 Now they start saying new things, they will forgive loans up to one lakh
 ye keval chhalaava he
 There was talk of changing the Chief Minister in 10 days, so far 18 Chief Ministers were to be changed, this government is a cheating government
 sutron kaa kahana he ki karjamaafee ke liye sarkaar ne praathamikta main jo kram tay kiya he, usamen sabase pehle sahakaari bank, phir kshetreey gramin vikaas bank or iske baad rashtriyakrut bainkon kaa karjmaaf hona he

 When asked if the authorities had questioned him on this issue, Maxwell said, "I was told on the phone that he was running it, but it didn't happen

 However, he did not say that there was any success in the talks with the government
 singh ne kaha ki yah mudda tol-mol vaala nahin he or ‘van rank, van pension’ kii avadharana ke donon tatwon main dakhal nahin diya ja saktaa
 He said that once we come to know what the government is going to offer, then only we can reach an agreement
 unhone kaha ki samiksha kii taarikh nishchit taur par ek april 2014 se honi chahie
 Independent MP Rajiv Chandrasekhar, who is mediating on the issue, said that it is time that a solution is found as soon as possible and the ex-servicemen return to their homes with full respect and dignity
 unhone purv sainikon se anurodh kiya ki ve har teen saal par pension kii samiksha ko sweekaar kar len
 Meanwhile, retired Colonel Pushpendra Singh, who is a bit ill, but has firm intentions, resumed his fast
 army aspataal se chuttee milane ke kuch hi ghanton baad unhone jantar mantar par anshan phir se shuru kar diya
 Seeking to implement 'one Rank, One Pension' immediately, Singh was admitted to the hospital last Monday, the ninth day of his fast

 ’ purv sainikon kaa bharosa khone kii baat ko khaarij karte hue jaavdekar ne kaha ki unhen yakeen he ki donon paksh taarkikta se pesh aaenge
 He said, 'we will fulfill what we have promised
 haalanki, unhone in sawaalon se kanni kaati ki kya sarkaar apane vaade ke anuroop oropi lagu kar degi
 The comments unhone kaha ki har saal pension kii samiksha ek mudda he
 He said, 'the merit of politics lies in that it avoids both dissatisfaction and financial burden
 ’ is bich, buudhvaar raat ek ucch-padasth adhikari ne kaha ki oropi par ‘bahut jald’ faisle kii ummid he
 He said this at a time when there are indications that an announcement could be made by the end of this week
 baad main satbir singh ne kaha, ‘ham teen saal par pension kii samiksha par taiyaar nahin honge
 We have made it clear that we can accept the proposal for review of pension in just two years, not more than this
 ’ unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii taraf se is babat koi taaja prastaav nahin aayaa he
 Retired Major General Satbir Singh, who has been leading the ongoing demonstration on the issue of 'one Rank, One Pension' at Jantar Mantar for the last 80 days, said that he has been receiving positive signals from the government for the last few days
 haalanki, unhone yah baat nahin kahi ki sarkaar se baatcheet main koi safalataa mili he
 Singh said that this issue is not weighing and both elements of the concept of 'one Rank, One Pension' cannot be interfered with
 unhone kaha ki ek baar hamen yah pataa chal jaae ki sarkaar kya peshkash karne vaali he, tabhi ham kisi samjhaute par pahunch sakate hai
 He said that the date for the review must be from April 1, 2014
 is mudde par madhyasthata kar rahe nirdaleey saansad rajeev chandrashekhar ne kaha ki yah vakt he ki jald se jald koi samaadhaan nikle or purv sainik puure sammaan evam garima ke saath apane ghar lauten
 He requested the ex-servicemen to accept the pension review every three years
 is bich, sevanivruth karnal pushpendra singh, jinaki tabiyat thodi kharaab he par iraadaa pakkaa he, ne apana aamaran anshan phir se shuru kar diya
 He resumed his fast at Jantar Mantar just hours after being discharged from the army hospital
 ‘van rank, van pension’ turant lagu karne kii maang kar rahe singh ko pichley somvaar ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha jo unke anshan kaa nauvaan din tha
 His medical report said that ketone levels in his body have increased a lot
 singh ko army hospital research and refral ke isiu main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha jahaan se buudhvaar ko unhen chuttee di gai
 Meanwhile, the central government seemed to be avoiding setting a deadline for resolving the issue, but it did say that it was fully committed to implementing its promise
 sarkaar ne bharosa jataayaa ki sabhi ko sweekaarya samaadhaan jald hi nikaal liya jayega
 ' kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne ek nijee channel ke kaarykram main bataaya, ‘ham der saver oropi lagu karenge jisase sabhi santusht rahen
 We will take steps that can be justified, which are worth explaining
 aakhirkaar ham puure samaaj ke liye nyaay kar rahe hai
 i am not an astrologer to tell the exact date
 kuch dinon main antim samaadhaan mil saktaa he
 Rejecting the ex-servicemen's loss of confidence, Javadekar said that he was sure that both sides would behave rationally
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane jo vaada kiya he, vah puraa karenge
 However, he cut down on these questions whether the government will implement OROP as promised
 tippaniyan He said that pension review is an issue every year
 unhone kaha, ‘raajnneeti kii yogyata isi main he ki vah asantosh or vittiya boj donon ko taale
 Meanwhile, a high-ranking official said on Wednesday night that a decision on OROP is expected 'very soon'
