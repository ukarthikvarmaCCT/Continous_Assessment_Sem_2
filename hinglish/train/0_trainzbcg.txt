 The political atmosphere has been hot in Pakistan in the wake of general elections and the arrest of former PM Nawaz Sharif
 ab navaj sharif ke bhai shahbaaj sharif ne bharat or pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam bhi pakistani chunaavon main oochaal diya he
 Shahbaz Sharif, who was the Chief Minister of Punjab province in Pakistan, has said that India has reached the G-20 and Pakistan is still watching the spectacle
 unhone kaha, 'aaj hindustan ji-20 main jaataa he to mere dil ko tir lag jaataa he ki modi vahaan jaakar khadaa hota he or ham tamaasha dekhte hai
 Let us make our country Pakistan of Iqbal and this will be done only through the right elections
 'shahbaaj sharif ne kaha, 'hamane bangladesh ko boj kii tarah liya or yah hamaare haathon se phisal gaya
 Look at Sri Lanka, Singapore, China
 sabhi ne hamaare blueprint par kaam kiya or aaj sab ham habase peeche hai
 If we still do not learn then it will be too late
 'navaj sharif kii party pakistan muslim lig (plm-n)navaj kii giraftaar ke maddenjaralahore main bada pradarshan karne vaali he
 Earlier, around 100 party leaders and executives were detained on Wednesday night
 shahbaaj sharif is samay PLM-N ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Earlier, Nawaz Sharif has said that the Pakistani army is also plotting against his party
 aapako bataa den ki shahbaaj sharif pakistan main hi hai or vah shuukravaar ko lahore main apane bhai navaj sharif ke swaagat ke liye party kaaryakartaaon kaa netritv karenge
 Let us tell you that in cases like disproportionate assets and corruption, Nawaz has been sentenced to 10 years and Maryam to seven years
 panama papers main naam saamne aane ke baad se navaj sharif ko pradhanmantri ke pad se istipha dena padaa tha or ab unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke cese chal rahe hai
 a decision has been taken against Nawaz in only one case of corruption and the decision is yet to come in three cases

 Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray on Monday gathered the ashes of his father and Shiv Sena mentor Bal Thackeray from Shivaji Park in central Mumbai and placed them in two urns
 ravivaar ko isi sthaan par thakare kaa antim sanskaar kiya gaya tha
 Uddhav went to Shivaji Park with the saints and saints on Monday and amidst the sacred mantras, he collected his father's ashes and placed them in the urn
 shivasena ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha, ek kalash do din ke liye party ke mukhyalay-sena bhawan main un logon ke darshan ke liye rakhaa jayega, jo sena pramukh kii antim yatra main shaamil nahin ho paae the
 The second urn will be placed at his residence - Matoshree
 do din baad thakare kii asthiyaan pavitra nadi main pravaahit kii jaaengi or antim sanskaar se sambandhit reetiyaan kii jaaengi
 It is not clear where their bones will flow
 udhar, bal thakare ke antim sanskaar ke ek din baad aaj mumbai phir se apni raftaar pakadaney lagi he or sadakon par texiyon tathaa autoricshawon ke chalane ke saath dhire-dhire bazaar bhi khul rahe hai
 Earlier on Saturday, the speed of Mumbai came to a standstill as news of the demise of Shiv Sena chief spread and there was a closed atmosphere
 diwali kii chhuttiyon ke baad skool or college aaj khulne the, lekin ab chuttee ek din or badha di gayi he or ye kal khulenge
 The Shiv Sena has not asked for any bandh but the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra (FAM) has called on its constituents and the business community to hold a shutdown in the state on Monday
 egeem ne apane sahyogi sanghathanon se apil kii he ki bal thakare ke sammaan main aaj shradhanjali diwas manaaya jaae
 Bal Thackeray, who was seriously unwell for some time, died in the afternoon on Saturday
 mumbai main sarrapha vyavsaayiyon ne bhi apane-apane pratishthanon ko band rakhaa

 Two days later, Thackeray's ashes will be flown into the holy river and rituals related to the funeral will be performed
 unki asthiyaan kahaan pravaahit kii jaaengi, abhi yah spasht nahin ho paaya he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi yah bhaleebhanti jaanate hai ki loksabhaa chunaavon main lagaataar duusari baar shandaar jeet ke saath hi unhone itihaas rach diya he
 In this sense, his diplomatic, administrative and political activities in support of the mandate are understandable, but 'mann Ki Baat 2'
 0' kii pehali kadi main unhone jis tarah se kitabon, pustak samskruti or hindi lekhakon kaa zikr kiya, vah na keval unke sahityapremi hone kaa sanket de rahaa, balki yah bhi ki vah kis tarah apni vyastata ke baavjood vah na keval swadhyay, saahitiyik kritiyon ko mahatva de rahe hai, balki unka zikr kar dusron ko bhi is disha main unmukh karne kaa prayaas kar rahe
 Prime Minister Modi gave a lot of time on the book discussion in this much talked dialogue organized on the radio with the people of the country
 is dauraan unhone munshi premchand or unki kai kahaniyon kaa zikr kiya
 However, the Prime Minister has already mentioned the story of Munshi Premchand ‘eidgah’ and its hero Hamid behind the Prime Minister Ujjwala scheme
 par is baar unhone jis tarah se karodon deshavaasiyon se pustakon kii baat kii vah aakhar jagat ke liye to ek sukhad sanket he hi, desh or deshavaasiyon ko shiksha, sahitya va samskruti kii disha main le jane vaale ek naye abhiyaan kaa bhi purvabhaas de rahaa
 The Prime Minister put his point on books in 'mann Ki Baat' - "my dear countrymen, you must have heard many times from my mouth, 'book not book', i was urged that we give books instead of flowers in the reception Can
 tab se kaafii jagah log kitaaben dene lage hai
 Recently someone gave me a book named 'premchand's Popular Stories'
 mujhe bahut acha laga
 Although i could not get much time, i got a chance to re-read some of his stories during my stay
 "premchand ne apni kahaniyon main samaaj kaa jo yatharth chithran kiya he, padhate samay uski chhavi aapke man main banane lagati he
 Every single thing written by him comes to life
 sahaj, saral bhashaa main maanviya samvednaaon ko abhivyakt karne vaali unki kahaniyaan mere man ko bhi chhu gayi
 His stories contain the sentiment of the whole of India
 jab main unki likhi ‘nasha’ naam kii kahani pard rahaa tha, to meraa man apane-aap hi samaaj main vyaapt aarthik vishmataaon par chalaa gaya
 i remembered the days of my youth, how the subject was debated overnight
 jameendaar ke bete ishwari or garib parivaar ke bir kii is kahani se sikh milti he ki agar aap saavdhaan nahin hai to buree sangati kaa asar kab chadh jaataa he, pataa hi nahin lagata he
 "the second story, which touched my heart deep inside, was 'idgah', the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, such a mature gesture at such a young age
 4-5 saal kaa hamid jab meley se chimata lekar apni daadi ke paas pahunchataa he to sach myne main, maanviya samvednaa apane charam par pahunch jaati he
 The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a very real truth in life, 'children Hamid played the part of old Hamid - old Amina, girl became Amina
 '"aisi hi ek badi maarmik kahani he ‘pus kii raat’
 In this story, a lively depiction of the irony of a poor peasant life was seen
 apni fasal nasht hone ke baad bhi haldu kisaan isliye khush hota he kyonki ab use kadaake kii thand main khet main nahin sona padegaa
 Although these stories date back almost a century, their relevance is felt the same today
 inhen padhane ke baad, mujhe ek alag prakaar kii anubhuti hui
 "remember that since his coronation in the year 2014, he has been flooded with books
 ek aankalan ke mutabik ab tak unpar saadhe teen sau se adhik pustaken likhi ja chuki hai
 At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself wrote a book to save school students from the stress of examinations, which translated into many languages and was widely spread
 yah kam aashcharya kii baat nahin he ki jo vipaksh akasar pradhanmantri kii degree ko lekar sawaal uthaata he, vah sahitya ko lekar maun he, par pradhanmantri akshar or adhyayan ko phir se mukhyadhara main laane kii koshish kar rahe
 He further said in his radio talk- "when it comes to reading, then in some media, i was reading about the Akshara Library of Kerala
 aapako yah jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki ye librari idukki ke ghaney jangalon ke bich based ek gaanv main he
 The primary school teacher here ke
 Muralitharan and P
, who runs a small tea shop
 ve
 Chinnathampi, both of them, have worked tirelessly for this library
 ek samay aisa bhi rahaa, jab gatthar main bharkar or peeth par ladakar yahan pustaken laai gai
 Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children
 "pradhanmantri bol rahe hon or gujarat kaa zikr na ho yah ho hi nahin saktaa
 Referring to his home state, he said, "the Vanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
 lakhon kii sankhya main har aayu varg ke vyakti ne pustaken padhane ke is abhiyaan main hissaa liya tha
 In today's digital world, in the time of Google Guru, i would also urge you to take some time and give the book a place in your daily routine
 aap sachmuch main bahut enjoy karenge or jo bhi pustak padhein uske bare main narendramodi App par zarur likhen taaki ‘man kii baat’ ke saare shrota bhi uske bare main jaan paayenge
 "clearly, after a long hiatus, the Prime Minister of the country has said to read, and continue to study, without any academic event
 is baat ke liye unki tarif kii jaani chahie
 One can say the same, who knows the importance of words and who can also write such a poem himself
 padhein pradhanmantri narendra modi kii'tasviir ke us paar'sheershak vaali yah kavitatum mujhe meri tasviir yaa poster mendhudhane kii vyarth koshish mat karomen to padmasana kii mudra main baitha humpane aatmavishvaas mempani vaani or karmkshetra main
 You know me only by my work, but not in the image of me, but in the smell of sweat, in the smell of the expansion of the plan, you recognize my voice with the echo of my voice
 **is kavita ke rachayita narendra modi hai
 This poem was published in his compilation 'aankh Aa Dhanya Chhe' published in Gujarati in the year 2007, which was published in Hindi as 'aankh Ye Dhanya Hai'
 anjana sandhir ne in kavitaaon ko hindi pathakon ke saamne rakhaa or aalochak ila prasad ne inhen jindagi kii aanch main tape hue man kii abhivyakti bataaya tha
 Sagar Vidhan Sabha is the seat of BJP
 yahaan pichley 25 saalon se bijepi kaa raaj he
 The MLA here is Shailendra Jain, who won from here in 2008 and 2013
 shailendra jain ke pehle is seat par sudhaa jain vidhayak thim
 She was successful in winning this seat in 1993, 1998 and 2003
 wo madhya pradesh sarkaar main mantri bhi rah chuki hai, lekin 2008 main unhen party ne tikat nahin diya
 City BJP president Shailendra Jain was elected in his place
 sagar vidhasanabha seat se pichley baar congress se utre susheel tiwari ab bijepi ke saath hai
 Now Amit Dubey, Navy Jain, Mukul Purohit, Bhupendra Singh Muhasa, Munna Chaubey are also claiming their place
 sagar kejatisamikaran kii baat karen to yahaan thakur or jain samudaay kaa acha khaasaa prabhaav he
 The past elections have seen the Jain community stand in favor of the BJP
 iske alaava yadav, muslim, obisi or pichhadaa varg kaa vot bhi yahaan nirnaayak hota he
 In the rainy season before the monsoon, people in many areas of Delhi had to face the problem of waterlogging
 ab iske liye bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 The delegation led by Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari will complain to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal against the Kejriwal government
 daramil bijepi kaa aarope he ki dilli main huijalabhravaki samasya ke liye dilli sarkaar kaa peedblyoody vibhaag jimmedaar he
 Because PWD is not having the cleaning of drains it is causing this problem
 saath hi dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne naalon kii safai ke maamle main dhaandhlee kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 PWD has 1010 major drains under Delhi
 inamen se maatr 85 naalon kii puri tarah se safai hui he
 More than 250 have not yet been handed over
 shesh lagbhag 700 naalon main keval dikhaawati safai kaary chalaaya gaya he
 The clash between the MCD and the Delhi government's PWD is well known
 jaahir he chaahe dilli kii choti sadaken ho yaa phir peedblyoody ke antargat aane vaali badi sadak, samasya har jagah ek si he
 There is waterlogging in Sibaris
 ise lekar sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag or nagar nigam ke bich kheenchaatani hoti he or logon ko kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is claiming to be the largest political party in the world with 8 crore 80 lakh members and these 8
 80 karod sadasyon main sipiem ke bhi ek varisht netaa bhi shaamil he
 BJP is not the largest party in the world BJP: There is no need to be a Congress party; Odisha CPM leader Janardan Pati did not become a member of the BJP on her own, but a few days ago a call came to her that she had become a member of the BJP
 unhone ek akhbaar ko bataaya ki 22 march kii shaam ko unhen ek anjaan number se kol ai
 The call was in a recorded voice that he had become a primary member of the BJP
 sipiem netaa ne bataaya, 'jab maine phone kaat diya to mere phone par ek massej aayaa, bijepi main aapkaa swaagat he or massej main membership number (1079741000) bhi likhaa tha
 'we are not going anywhere: Amit shahbjp is running a missed call membership campaign, through which it has become the largest party in the world
 haalanki janardan pati is baat se inkaar karte hai ki unhone koi missd kol kii thi
 He claimed that the recorded message was in the voice of BJP state president Kanak Vardhan Singh Dev, welcome to the party
 unhone kaha, 'maine apni taraf se koi massej yaa kol nahin kii thi
 Janardan Pati, a member of the Central Committee of the CPM for the last two decades, is now preparing to appeal for intervention in this matter by writing to the Election Commission
 uttar pradesh ke bhadohi main raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki desh ne chaar prakaar ke shashan dekhe hai, ‘nampanthi', ‘vampanthi', ‘damanpanthi' or ab ‘vikaspanthi
 He said that 'mahamilavati' parties do not want to accept India's growing strength in the global scenario

 Will farmers' income really double? May not be this year, but will it be six years later in 2022? Prime Minister Narendra Modi is emphasizing in his farmer rallies that the efforts of his government will double farmers' income after six years
 vitt mantri ne bhi apane bajet main is baat ko doharaaya he
 For the first time, the income of farmers is being doubled and it is not even discussed
 kya pataa kisaan din raat yahi baat karte hon ki jab itnaa sabar kiya to chah saal or sahi
 Does the address really double the income? kya vaaqai aisa ho jayega? zarur hona chahie or kyon nahin hoga
 Do we know what the annual income of farmers is right now? The Economic Survey report states that farmers in 17 states of the country have an annual income of twenty thousand rupees
 ise aap maheene main baantenge to karodon kisaanon kii masik ausat aay 1662 rupee hoti he
 Stop thinking about how our farmer would have won in such a small amount of money
 ab agar pradhanmantri apane vaade main safal rahe to saal 2022 main yahi dugani hokar 3332 rupee ho jaaegi
 If you include inflation, then this money will not have any status
 agar pradhanmantri ji kaa kahana sahi he to kya ve yahi nahin kah rahe hai ki kisaanon kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 What is so special in such a slight increase that the government is emphasizing so much on double income 
 chah saal baad agar 3332 rupee prati maah ho bhi jaae to kisaanon kii aarthik sthiti main kya badlaav aayega
 It is also not clear whether the government will double farm income or double the income of people living in rural areas
 pradhanmantri to kisaan kaa hi naam le rahe hai magar gaanv main sirf kisaan nahin rahata he
 If the government wants to double the income of the farmers, then why not talk about giving the price by adding fifty percent of the cost of crops? The BJP has written on page 44 of its manifesto that it will be ensured that fifty per cent of the cost is benefited
 sarkaar bataaye ki ise sunishchit karne ke liye kya kar rahi he? samarthan mulyon main vruddhi kii haalat dekhakar to nahin lagata na hi laagat main koi kami ai he
 The support price we get right now is very difficult to extract the cost
 kya sarkaar ne koi nayaa farmula khoj liya he jiske dam par inakam dabl karne kaa daawa kar rahi he
 If this is the case then the same thing should be said clearly
 kai baar lagata he ki sarkaar apane us vaade ko chhod baaki baaten karne main lagi he
 The government has started talking about an integrated market
 bazaar ke system main bilkul sudhaar hona chahie lekin yah abhi saaf nahin he ki isse qimaton main oochaal hi aa jayega
 Economist Devendra Sharma gave an example that two hundred mandis have been integrated in Karnataka, yet tomato prices are below cost
 chunavi charchaaon ke dauraan kisaanon ke liye aay ayog kii baat chali thi wo baat bhi nae nae sapanom main kho chuki he
 The comments rahi baat is baar ke bajet main gaanvon kii taraf dhyaan dene kii to wo swaagat yogya he
 But with the increase of a few thousand crores in every item, the destination will not be easy
 gaanvon main buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas se rojgaar vyapaar ke avasar badhenge lekin sabake liye badhenge koi zaruri nahin
 Must visit places where the roads are good and the means of irrigation are better
 punjab ek udhaaharan ho saktaa he
 There the condition of farming and farmer is poor
 isaliye kisaanon ko apane paas ek calculator rakhana chahie
 From now on, it should start subtracting that his income is going to double in 2022
 maheene kaa 3332 rupaya bahut hoga isliye use kharch karne kii yojana banane kaa abhyaas shuru kar dena chahie
 It is sad that we deliver slogans to the farmers, but do not tell how the slogan will come true
 har din ek nayaa slogan puraane slogan ko kha jaataa he
 Will it really happen? There must be and why will not happen
 kya ham jaanate hai ki abhi kisaanon kii salanaa aamadani kitni he? aarthik surveykshan kii report main likhaa he ki desh ke 17 rajyon ke kisaanon kii salanaa aay bees hazaar rupee hai
 If you divide it in a month, then the monthly average income of crores of farmers is Rs 1662
 hamaara kisaan itane kam paise main kaise jeeta hoga yah sochna band hi kar dijiye to thik rahegaa
 Now if the Prime Minister is successful in his promise, then in 2022, this will double to Rs 3332
 mudrasphiti ko shaamil kar len to is raqam kii bhi koi haisiyat nahin rahegi
 If the Prime Minister is right, then is this not what he is saying that nothing can happen to farmers
 itani maamuli vruddhi main aisa kya khaas nazar aa rahaa he ki dabl inakam vaali baat par sarkaar itnaa jor de rahi he
 Even after six years, if it becomes Rs 3332 per month, then what will be the change in the economic condition of the farmers
 yah bhi saaf nahin ho paa rahaa he ki sarkaar kheti kii aamadani ko dabl kar degi yaa gramin kshetra main rahane vaale logon kii aamadani dabl kar degi
 The Prime Minister is taking the name of the farmer but only the farmer does not live in the village
 agar sarkaar kisaanon kii aamadani dabl hi karnaa chaahati he to fasalon kii laagat kaa pachaas fisadi jod kar daam dene kii baat kyon nahin karti? bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr ke pej 44 par likhaa he ki sunishchit kiya jayega ki laagat kaa pachaas fisadi laabh ho
 What should the government be doing to ensure this? It is not possible to see the condition of increase in support prices and there is no reduction in cost
 abhi jo samarthan mulya miltaa he usase bahut mushkil se laagat nikal paata he
 Has the government discovered any new formula, claiming to double the income on its own? agar aisa he to yahi baat saaf saaf kahi jaani chahie
 At times, it seems that the government is busy talking about everything except its promise
 sarkaar ekikrut bazaar kii baat karne lagi he
 There should be a complete improvement in the system of the market, but it is not yet clear that this will only increase the prices
 arthshaastri devendra sharma ne ek udhaaharan diya ki karnataka main do sau mandiyon ko ekikrut kiya gaya he phir bhi tamaato ke daam laagat se kam he
 There was talk of income commission for farmers during election discussions, that thing has also been lost in new dreams
 tippaniyan It is welcome to pay attention to the villages in this budget
 lekin har mad main chand hajaar karod kii vruddhi kar dene se hi manzil aasaan nahin hone vaali
 The development of infrastructure in villages will increase employment business opportunities but will not increase for everyone
 un jagahon par jaakar dekhnaa chahie jahaan sadaken acchhee hai or sinchai ke saadhan behatar
 Punjab can be an example
 vahaan kheti or kisaan kii haalat khasta he
 Therefore, farmers should keep a calculator with them
 abhi se jodna ghataana shuru kar dena chahie ki 2022 main uski aamadani dabl hone vaali he
 3332 rupees a month will be a lot, so he should start the practice of planning to spend
 dukhad he ki ham kisaanon ke paas slogan pahunchaa dete hai lekin slogan kaise saakaar hoga nahin bataate
 Every day a new slogan eats the old slogan
 agar pradhanmantri ji kaa kahana sahi he to kya ve yahi nahin kah rahe hai ki kisaanon kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa
 What is so special in such a slight increase is that the government is emphasizing so much on double income
 chah saal baad agar 3332 rupee prati maah ho bhi jaae to kisaanon kii aarthik sthiti main kya badlaav aayega

 Politics is considered to be the art of making everything possible and this is how the expert Lalu is praising Brahmins these days, he confirms this
 rajd sarvesarva ne haal hi main apane bete tej pratap se brahman mahasabha ke ek sadsy ke paanv chune ko kaha jo rajd ke samarthan kaa aashwaasan dene vahaan aae the

 In every encounter, the target is the crook's feet, whether he is running, or on foot
 bike par savaar ho yaa phir gaadi par chal rahaa ho
 UP police shoots directly at the feet of a crook
 khaas baat ye ki sabhi badmaashon ke encounter kii kahani bhi ek jaisi hoti he
 12 September 2019 Noida Police had an encounter with a vicious crook Atish Pastor at around 1 pm
 muthbhed main use pair main goli lagi phir police ne use giraftaar kar liya
 According to the police, Atish Parsar hails from Madhya Pradesh

 Shot in Ajit's leg
 uske baad police ne use giraftaar kiya
 Police claimed that one of his companions escaped during this period
 upi police ke ek jaise encounterye saare encounter uttar pradesh police ne kiye hai
 In almost every encounter, the target of the police was so accurate that the miscreants were shot in the leg
 lagbhag har muthbhed main police kii kahani milti julati hi lagati he
 The question is why in 98 out of 100 encounters, bullets are shot in the feet of miscreants
 yogi sarkaar ne upi police ko badmaashon ke encounter kii khuli chhot de rakhi he
 Talking about western Uttar Pradesh, the Meerut Range Police conducted 674 encounters from 9 January 2019 to 11 September 2019 i
e
 9 months
 jinamein 1142 aaropee badmaash giraftaar kiye gaye

 19 badmaashon kii encounter ke dauraan police kii goli lagane se maut hui
 Police claim that 132 policemen have also been injured during this period
 sawaalon par police kaa javabupi police ke encounter par kai baar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Especially on a script made of almost every encounter and the bullets being shot in the leg
 meerut range ke ediji prashanth kumaar ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha ki koun sawaal uthaa rahaa he ki pair main hi goli kyon lagati he
 If the crooks raise questions, then who the crooks do not question the police
 encounter ke baad jin badmaashon ke pair main goli lagati he
 He is treated in a hospital
 uske baad jail bhej diya jaataa he
 When they get a bell, they come out and everyone's feet remain safe
 yogi sarkaar ke aane ke baad upi police ke danaadan hone vaale encounter kaa maamla supreme court tak gaya tha
 However the UP police had also responded to that
 lekin upi ke mukhyamantri ne upi police ko badmaashon par zarurat padane par goli chalaane kii khuli chhot de rakhi he
 So the question arises whether the policemen are getting accustomed to capture the miscreants and shoot them in the leg in the process of making their numbers

 or main unhen garv ke saath bataa sakuun ki ek bachche ko garbh main rakhana kitna kathin kaam hota he
 They may push my loose belly, but i want to tell that i am happy with this body, keeping them

 i do not want them to consider the woman's taut breast as ideal, which may have been made digitally in a magazine
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki aage chalakar inkaa aakaar badalata he khaastaur par bacchon ke janm lene ke baad

 mujhe vishwaas he ki meri iskoshish se bacchon main khud samaj aa jaegior ve hi mujhe apana sharir dhakne ke liye kahenge
 There will come a time when they will knock in my room
 tab tak main unhen chhot dena chaahati hum ki ve meraa sharir chhukar dekhen
 With these experiences when they get married
 kuch umr ke baad jab unki patniyaan kahengi ki 'kaash hamaare pair thode patale hote' to mere bete jawaab denge ki 've jaise bhi hai parfect hai'

 You too must have heard from elders in your house that eating after eight o'clock at night can be harmful
 aaj bhi gramin ilaakon main log raat aath baje yaa usase pehle hi khaanaa kha lete hai
 But the urban lifestyle is completely different from this
 shaharon main aamtaur par log der raat khaanaa khate hai
 Some are compelled because they have to work in the office till late at night, but for some people this is a habit
 agar aap bhi der raat yani 10 se 12 baje ke bich khaanaa khaane waalon main se hai to aapako bataa den ki bahut let khaanaa khaanaa sehat ke liye nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 The biggest disadvantage of eating food late at night is that it increases the possibility of becoming obese
 aapako ye jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki zyaadaatar logon ke mote hone kii yahi sabase ahm vajah he
 Generally people who suffer from night eating syndrome take a high amount of carbohydrates during meals
 saath hi unke khaane main fat kii maatra bhi adhik hoti he
 People who eat late at night may not eat in large quantities during dinner, but after that they begin to eat
 jo vajan badhaane kaa kaam karata he
 Many times those who eat late night food also have insomnia problem
 der raat khaanaa khaane waalon menkhaane-pine se judi duusari aniyamitataayena jaati hai
 Such people also have many problems related to sleep
 der raat khaanaa khaane vaale logon main chidchidapan aa jane kii bhi ashanka bahut adhik hoti he
 If you are compelled to eat late at night, then try to have the highest amount of fiber in your food
 aap chahen to apane dinar main sabji or salad ko pramukhataa se shaamil kar sakate hai
 While eating food late at night can be harmful for you, while eating too early, you do your harm
 aise main jaruri he ki khaane kaa samay sahi ho
 As a rule, you can eat something light in the evening
 par wo junk food na hokar kuch healdi ho to behatar rahegaa
 After having breakfast in the evening you have a few hours
 in teen se chaar ghante ke bich main aapkaa naashtaa pach jaataa he
 Now you can have dinner
 sahi samay par dinar karne kaa ek phayda ye bhi he ki uske baad aapke paas tahalne kaa bhi samay bachaa rahata he
 People who eat late night food usually lie in bed immediately after dinner, which affects the digestive system
 to koshish kiijie ki aapke dinar kaa time sahi ho taaki aapako uskaa puraa poshan mil sake
 Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad property has also been revealed in the GV Mall of Patna, where a terrible fire broke out on Saturday morning and ruined property due to the burning of many shops inside the mall
 lalu yadav in dinon benami sampatti ke aarope se jujh rahe hai
 The BJP is constantly attacking Lalu over soil scams and family property
 pichley kuch vakt se lalu prasad ke khilaaf benami sampatti arjeet karne ke sansanikhej khulaase karne vaale bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne dastavej pesh karte hue kaha he ki isi mal main lalu kii beti rohiniacharya kii bhi sampatti he
 While providing the documents to the media, Sushil Kumar Modi informed that on 31 January 2014, Rohini Acharya bought 983 sq ft in this mall and for this he gave 58 lakh 98 thousand rupees

 41 lakh karod rupee kaa kaala dhan!praarambhik report ke anusaar 1990 se lekar 2008 ke bich main congress shashan ke dauraan desh main aarthik sudhaaron ke daur main 9,41,837 karod rupye kaa kaala dhan baahar bheja gaya
 The 73rd Preliminary Report on Black Money in the country has been reviewed by the Standing Committee on Finance
 is report ko neshnal institute of public finance and policy, neshnal council of applide iconomics research or neshnal institute of financial management kii report par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 The highest black money real estate mentoring committee on finance has said in this preliminary report that the sectors which have the highest amount of black money are real state, mining, pharmaceuticals, pan masala, gutkha, tobacco industry, bullion and commodity markets
 iske alaava sabase zyada kaala dhan film industry, ajukational institute or profeshnals ke dwaara istemaal kiya jaataa he
 There is also a glut of black money in the security market and manufacturing
 desh bhar main kitna kaala dhan he iske bare main koi bhi tarksangat anumaan nahin he
 With this, it is also said that the method of how to estimate it has not yet been found

 It was found from the study of the three institutions that it is difficult to estimate the black money estimates inside and outside the country because it is said that the estimates of the three institutes vary greatly
 chif ichonamik adwiser ne cameti ko yah suzav diya ki teenon institute kii report ko ek saath rakhkar saajha anumaan bhi nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Nearly 500 billion black money went out in thirty years! The National Council of Applied Economics Research (NCAER) has estimated in various ways that from 1980 to 2010 the amount of black money sent out from India was $ 384 billion to $ 490 billion

 The National Institute of Financial Management (NIFN) has estimated that during the reform period between 1990 and 2008, black money worth Rs 9,41,837 crore was sent out

 gurugram ke khedkidaula main jameen kharid dhokhadhadi maamle main robert wadra va bhupendra singh hooda ke khilaaf ek or FIR darj hone par siyaasi ghamaasan shuru ho gaya he
 From the FIR against Vadra, the Tilamilai Congress has attacked the BJP in a befitting manner
 saath hi congress ne bijepi par raajnneetik badale kii bhaavana se karrwai karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Congress leader Rashid Rizvi said that it is very unfortunate that the BJP government is taking action in the matter as Lok Sabha elections are approaching
 yah maamla pichley saadhe chaar saal kaa he or ab exiaar darj karai ja rahi he
 He taunted that the government had all the wisdom
 Do people not understand this? He said that the public understands everything very well
 unhone kaha ki vartmaan sarkaar vipaksh ko khatm kar dena chaahati he
 This government wants to do politics by intimidating and threatening
 unhone kaha ki hindustan ke loktantr kii puri duniya main izzat hoti he
 Our democracy has been very strong and powerful
 yah sarkaar hindustan ko pakistan bana dena chaahati he
 Like Pakistan, it wants to put the Prime Minister of the previous government in jail
 pakistan ke purv pradhanmantri navaj sharif jail main hai
 Congress leader Rizvi questioned whether the opposition within India is dishonest
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke saansadon ko pakadaa ja rahaa he
 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav is being kept in jail, action is being taken against Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati and Congress leaders
 unhone poocha ki kya bijepi ke sabhi netaa doodh ke dhule hai
 Why no action is taken against them? The Vyapam scam took place in Madhya Pradesh, but Shivraj Singh Chauhan remains the chief minister
 unke khilaaf na to koi karrwai kii gai or na hi unase istipha liya gaya
 Action was also not taken against Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj
 congress netaa ne kaha ki bainkon kaa paise lekar fararkingfisher kaa maalik vijay maalyaaram se landan main rah rahaa he
 The charge of PNB fraud is not being tried to bring back Nirav Modi
 unhone kaha ki is desh ke andar aisa kabhi nahin hua he, jab loktantr ko kamjor karne kii koshish kii gai ho
 The BJP again reminded the Congress, while reversing the Emergency, BJP leader Nalin Kohli said, "rashid Rizvi is a senior Congress leader, but i am unable to understand his voice in the matter whether i laugh or cry?" Emergency was imposed in the country in the 1970s and the leaders of all other parties were jailed except the Congress
 sabake sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko nazarandaaj kar diya gaya tha
 The BJP leader questioned that where was Rashid Rizvi when the leaders of all parties were sent to jail during the Emergency? Do they not know what happened at that time? Vadra's business model did not come to understand the country: BJP BJP leader Kohli said that Robert Vadra's business model is not understood by anyone in the country
 congress jaraa yah baat samajha de ki koi vyakti bina paise lagaae kisi kii jameen letaa he or phir usee ko waapas bech detaa he
 In the middle of this is Hooda, the then Chief Minister of Haryana
 haryana sarkaar wadra kii company ko license de detii he
 He said that if the Congress says that there is nothing wrong in it, then they should tell the country
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki neshnal herald cese main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi aaropee hai
 Rising on this, Rizvi said that why did the BJP not take action against Amit Shah's son? Vadra said - Robert Vadraka says in the matter what is new in this case
 chunaav kaa mausam he or tel ke daam bade hue hai, isliye logon kii samasyaon se dhyaan hataane ke liye yah kiya ja rahaa he
 My decade old case is being tossed out
 haryana sarkaar ne kaha- yah saream karpshan helloksabhaa chunaav najadik aane kii vajah se karrwai karne ke congress ke aarope par haryana sarkaar ke mantri opi dhanakad ne kaha ki congress ne pehle khud hi badi damadari se maamle kii jaanch kii maang uthaai thi
 When these cases were investigated and an FIR was registered, the Congress started saying that it was a political vendetta
 ab dhokhadhadi ke maamle saamne aae hai, to congress ke bolne kaa andaaj bhi badal gaya he
 This is a public corruption and nothing is hidden in it
 kya he puraa maamlahryana ke gurugram ke khedkidaula main jameen kharid maamle main robert wadra va bhupendra singh hooda ke khilaaf ek or FIR darj kii gai he
 The FIR alleges that Robert Vadra committed fraud by conniving with his political clout and Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 iske alaava wadra kii company dlef or omkareshwar properties ke khilaaf bhi exiaar darj kii gai he
 These firs were registered under sections 420, 120B, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code
 iske alaava privansion of karpshan act 1988 kii dhara 13 ke tahat bhi karrwai kii gai he
 According to the FIR, 350 acres of land in the case was allotted to Robert Vadra's company DLF and Skylight Hospitality for Rs 58 crore
 is jameen kaa aavanton bhupendra singh hooda ke jariye kiya gaya tha, jo us samay haryana ke mukhyamantri the
 According to the FIR, the benefit of about five thousand crore rupees was given to both the companies of Vadra from this land
 iske alaava omkareshwar properties par bhi maamle main shaamil hone ke aarope hai

 gujarat main 81 varshiya bijepi vidhayak narottam patel ne apane bayaan par yutern lete hue kaha he ki vah vah chunaav ladane ke liye jawan hai
 For this, he has also cited a statement by party president Amit Shah
 aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main khadey nahin hone ke apane puraane rukh se palati maarthe hue bhaajapa vidhayak narottam patel ne party adhyaksh amit shah ke ek bayaan kaa hawala dete hue phir se chunavi maidan main utarane kaa iraadaa jaahir kiya he
 Patel, 81, is an MLA from Udhana seat in Surat
 unhone is saal april main elaan kiya tha ki vah vidhansabha chunaav main nahin ladenge
 Senior BJP leaders LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi have been included in the party's guiding board
 iske baad se yah majboot dharna saamne aayi thi ki sambhavat: bijepi ne abchunavladane kii seemaa 75 varsh nirdhaarit kar di he
 However, BJP President Amit Shah denied this
 vahiin piem narendra modi bhi new india ke bahaane yuvaaon kii bhagidaari badhaane par jor de chuke hai
 Despite this, Patel wants to contest again
 vah lagaataar paanch baar vidhansabha chunaav jite hai
 However, Patel cited Shah's recent statement in which the BJP president had said that there is no rule prohibiting the BJP from contesting elections for those over the age of 75
 patel ne kaha, ‘‘yah sach he ki maine april maheene main kaha tha ki mangujrat chunaavanhin laduunga
 i had decided that because my party said that it is desirable for 75-year-old leaders not to contest elections
 ’’aapako bataa den ki tripal talaak ke mudde par gujarat ke purv mantri or bijepi vidhayak narottam patel ne musalamaanon kii shaadi par vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Narottam Patel had said that it is due to more marriages that triple divorce comes about
 unhone kaha tha ki desh main har kisi kii jindagi ek jaisi honi chahie

 At the Mohali rally, after the statement of Manish Sisodia who voted Kejriwal as the CM of Punjab, Kejriwal's explanation has also come to the fore
 kejariwal ne elaan kiya ki wo punjab ke siem nahin banenge or na hi dilli chodenge, lekin is puure maamle par siyasat abhi bhi nahin tham rahi he
 Delhi BJP has said that Deputy cm's statement has exposed Kejriwal's strategy, even though Kejriwal is taking a U-turn, but Tarjuba says that Kejriwal's words are not trustworthy
 bijepi sisodiya ke bayaan par to yakeen kar rahi he lekin kejariwal ke elaan ko maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 BJP national minister and former Delhi MLA R
 pi
 Singh also gave the reason for this
 aar
 P
 singh ke mutabikkejarivalkahakar mukarne ke maamle main record bana chuke hai, aise main sisodiya ke bayaan par unki safai bharose karne laayak nahin lagati
 R
 pi
 Singh also gave reasons for this: -1
 kejariwal agar punjab kaa siem banane kii hasarat nahin paal rahe hai, to punjab main apane siem ummidavaar kaa naam kyon nahin bataa rahe hai
 2
 agar kejarivalpunjab main kursiper baithne kii chahat nahin paale hue hai, to dilli main dipti siem ko siem kii tarah kyon istemaal kar rahe hai
 3
 kejariwal to apane bacchon kii kasam khaakar bhi congress se samjhauta kar dilli main 49 din kii sarkaar bana chuke hai
 4
 kejariwal ne 49 din kii sarkaar se istipha dene ke baad vaada kiya tha ki dilli chhodkar nahin jaaenge, lekin varanasi chunaav ladane pahunch gaye the
 5
 varanasi se bhi vaada kiya tha ki chunaav haarane ke baad vahaan ke logon kii seva karenge, lekin phir dilli aa gaye or ab punjab bhaagane kii taiyaari main he
 It is obvious that BJP and all the anti-parties had launched a round of attack on Kejriwal after Sisodia's statement and after this ruckus, Kejriwal has played this new bet of repentance and denial

 unhone kaha ki upie sarkaar ne yuddh kii sthiti ke laayak hathiyaar or gola-barood ke jakhire ko banaae rakhane ke liye kadam nahin uthaae
 Manohar Parrikar claimed that the situation had improved earlier in the tenure of the Modi government

 This report states that the army is struggling with a huge amount of ammunition and it has only 20 days of arms and ammunition for the days of war

 input: bhashaa There is no doubt that Sallu Bhai's film on Eid does record breaking business
 aisa hameshaa se hota aayaa he or inshabllah aage bhi aisa hi hota rahegaa
 But this time Salman Khan will get such an idiom that his film Kick will become the fourth highest business film of Bollywood in the whole world, which may not have even been expected by Salman himself

 Ravichandran Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha played well in the absence of Harbhajan returning to the team in the ongoing T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka

" jab vah apni sarvshereshth farm main lautega to aapke paas team main teen achche spinner ho jaaenge or iske alaava teen leg spinner team main jagah banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Kumble said that Harbhajan can still contribute a lot to the national team

 In such a situation, some percentage of the vote of Raghuraj Pratap Singh could go to BSP, so it was believed that he would not cast his vote
 lekin unhone baad main jaakar matdaan kiya
 She then met CM Yogi Adityanath
 mana ja rahaa tha ki rajyasabha chunaav main 398 vidhayak hi karenge
 In terms of vote arithmetic, BJP will not get the votes of two mlas

 But this did not happen, 400 mlas of the state voted
 bataa den ki basapa ko abhi tak kul 34 vot mili hai
 It consists of 17 votes of BSP, 10 votes of Samajwadi Party and 7 votes of Congress

 Please tell that many criminal cases are registered against Raghuraj, including murder

 ) Chandra Grahan: Today's longest lunar eclipse The longest lunar eclipse of the century today, know what science says england ke khilaaf hone vaali tii20 siries ke liye leg spinner amit mishra or of spinner parvej rasul ko team india main jagah di gai he
 Given the busy schedule of Team India and the effective performance so far in the series against England, the selectors have given rest to Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja and have decided to give Mishra and Rasool a chance in their place
 amit mishra kii baat karen to unka gendbaaji kaushal se to har koi waakif he
 This right-arm spinner has the ability to destroy the batting order of any team with his 'variations'
 is lihaaj se ve nishvith rup se maukey ke hakdaar the
 However, he has been in and out of the team due to lack of consistency in performance
 kam hi logon ko yaad hoga ki amit mishra ne shorter formet ke apane pichley match main hi karishmai gendbaaji karte hue bhartiya team ko yaadgaar jeet dilaai thi
 In this ODI match played in October 2016, 'mishri' demolished the Kiwi batting order
 is match main amit ne mahaj 18 ran dekar paanch wicket liye the or team india kii 3-2 kii siries jeet main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Not only this, he was also Man of the Match and Man of the Series in this series against New Zealand
 27 varshiya harfanmaulaa parvej rasul kaa chayan jarur kuch hairaan kar rahaa he lekin jammu-kashmir ke is khilaadi ne bhi hasil hue maukon par apni pratibha kaa loha manvaaya he
 (read, so i am a little disappointed that all-rounder Parvez Rasool of Jammu and Kashmir) parvej rasul daaen haath se spin gendbaaji ke alaava acchhee ballebaaji bhi kar lete hai
 Team India's great spinner Bishan Singh Bedi has praised Parvez Rasool as a bowler full of talent
 rasul kii gendbaaji ko dhardaar banane main bedi kaa mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 Rasool, who represented Team India in a one-day match, has been rewarded for his consistently good performance in domestic cricket and he certainly deserved the opportunity
 rasul wicket-tu-wicket gendbaaji karne main maahir he or ve gend ko zyada flite nahin karaate
 In this context, they can prove useful in odis and T20s
 tippaniyan Anyway, after showing the glow in domestic cricket, the demand for Parvez Rasool to get a place in Team India has been loudly rising in his state of Jammu and Kashmir
 yah maang karne waalon main rajya ke purv siem umr abdulla bhi shaamil rahe hai
 In 2013, when Rasool did not get a place in the fifth and final ODI against Zimbabwe, Omar Abdullah expressed disappointment
 umr ne twit kiya tha ki kya rasul ko zimbabwe sirf isliye le jaaya gaya ki uskaa manobal giraaya jaae
 This work could have been done easily in the country as well
 purv kendriya mantri shashi tharur or khel sameekshak ayaaj memon ne bhi us samay rasul ko plaing ilevan main mauka nahin dene ke faisle par sawaal uthaaya tha
 Parvez has so far taken two wickets for Team India playing one ODI
 vaise gharelu cricket kaa unka record khaasaa prabhavi he
 They 38 in 58 first class matches
 87 ke ausat se teen hajaar se adhik ran bana chuke hai jisamen aath shatak shaamil hai
 Not only this, 156 wickets in first-class matches are also registered in this player's name
 37 tii20 maichon (international nahin) main 478 ran or 27 wicket bhi parvej ke naam par darj hai
 
 
 Very few people will remember that Amit Mishra had given a memorable victory to the Indian team in his last match of short format, bowling charismatic

 The selection of 27-year-old all-rounder Parvez Rasool is a bit surprising, but the Jammu and Kashmir player has also proved his talent on the number of occasions
 (padhein, isliye thode niraash hai jammu-kashmir ke harfanmaulaa parvej rasul) In addition to spin bowling with right hand, Parvez Rasool also bats well
 team india ke mahaan spinner bishan singh bedi parvej rasul ko pratibha se bharpoor gendbaaj maanate hue unki prashansa kar chuke hai
 Bedi has contributed significantly in making Rasool's bowling sharper
 ek vanade match main team india kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke rasul ko gharelu cricket main lagaataar acha pradarshan karne kaa inaam mila he or ve nishvith rup se is maukey ke hakdaar the
 Rasul specializes in bowling wicket-to-wicket and they do not allow the ball to fly much

 The comments vaise bhi gharelu cricket main chamak dikhaane ke baad parvej rasul ko team india main jagah milane kii maang unke rajya jammu-kashmir main jorshor se uthati rahi he
 Former state CM Omar Abdullah has also been included in the demand

 Omar had tweeted whether Rasool was taken to Zimbabwe only to drop his morale
 yah kaam to desh main bhi aasaani se ho saktaa tha
 Former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor and sports critic Ayaz Memon also questioned the decision not to give Rasool a chance in the playing XI at that time
 parvej ne ab tak team india kii ore se ek vanade khelte hue do wicket hasil kiye hai
 By the way, his record of domestic cricket is very effective

 Rasool, who represented Team India in a one-day match, has been rewarded for his consistently good performance in domestic cricket and he certainly deserved the opportunity
 rasul wicket-tu-wicket gendbaaji karne main maahir he or ve gend ko zyada flite nahin karaate
 In this context, they can prove useful in odis and T20s

 Two days ago on October 29, at half past two in the afternoon, when Raj Bhavan released the list of 8 ministers removed from the ruling SP government in the state, there were indications that Mulayam Singh was still in the mood to give Akhilesh Yadav the team of his choice
 Are not in yahi vajah rahi ki pichley do saalon ke dauraan pradesh main sabase zyada vivaadit rahe khanan vibhaag ke cabinet mantri gayatri prasad prajapati mulaayam singh kii pasand hone ke chalate kshamaadaan paane main safal rahe
 At the same time Vinod Kumar Singh alias Pandit Singh, MLA from Gonda, the second most controversial leader and Minister of State for Secondary Education in the SP government, benefited from Mulayam Singh's proximity
 ye rajya mantri se pramotion paakar cabinet mantri ban gaye
 Not only this, by giving prominence to the leaders of his choice in the cabinet expansion that took place on October 31 (see box), Mulayam Singh made it clear that he is not in the mood to give 'free-hand' to Akhilesh Yadav before the 2017 assembly elections
 
 ab yah bhi saaf he ki agle vidhansabha chunaav main sapa kaa cheharaa to mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav hi honge, lekin chunavi jang mulaayam ke sipahasaalar ladenge
 Mulayam Singh, engaged in rallies 'branding' from rallies-2017, has chalked out a strategy to highlight the achievements of Akhilesh Yadav government by holding intensive rallies across the state
 aktubar ke pehle hakrate main unhone akhilesh yadav samet sapa ke anya sheersh netaaon ke saath baithak kar reliyon kii ruparekha taiyaar kar lee he
 a general secretary of the party says, "these rallies took place before the Lok Sabha elections - Save the country, create the country

 Soon after the panchayat elections, these rallies will take place at all the divisional headquarters of the state and Mulayam Singh will be present as the main speaker
 iske liye party ke jila stareey netaaon ko sapa mukhyalay se do kitaaben vitarit kii ja rahi hai
 In one of these books, the achievements of the Akhilesh Yadav government are mentioned, and in the second, it is a book of incomplete promises of the BJP government at the center

 It was Agarwal's influence that even after Mulayam, Dr

 At the same time, he tried to allay the displeasure by promoting the disgruntled Agarwal's son Nitin Agarwal to the post of Minister of State (independent Charge)

 The ambassador, which was once the favorite car of the political class in India, continues to flourish and is 'precious' for the candidates who are contesting the 16th Lok Sabha elections and they have mentioned it in their affidavits in the list of assets

 Hindustan Motors was founded in 1942, a few years before Independence, which was the country's first carmaker and was a favorite car of politicians, bureaucrats and the ruling class for years and had a monopoly on the market for nearly 80 years

 There has been a stir in political circles since Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Hanumangarhi temple on Friday
 tamaam partiyaan unke mandir jane ke alag-alag matlab nikaal rahi hai
 In the wake of Uttar Pradesh elections, Rahul has been campaigning for the Congress by wandering in UP for four days
 rahul hanumangadhi mandir jane ko lekar sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne unhen naseehat de daali or kaha ki chaahe rahul kuch bhi karalen ab uttar pradesh main congress kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 Question- Sadhvi ji, a leader of Gandhi family has gone to Ayodhya after many years, he has worshiped Hanuman Garhijakar Hanuman
 lekin ram janm bhoomi nahin gaye
 How do we see? After Sadhvi and Rajiv Gandhi, no one thought it appropriate to go there
 mere khyaal se rahul gandhi ji bhi agar ram janmabhumi sthal par jate to unako bhi hakeekat maaloom hoti
 If any leader goes to Ayodhya, he goes to Ram's birthplace
 main yah kah sakati hum kii unako 2017 kaa chunaav dikhaai de rahaa he, agar ram janm bhoomi par jate to sampradayikta kaa thappa lag jayega or ek varg cat jayega
 i had said that Ram temple is an issue of faith
 sawaal-kya vajah lagati he ki itane saalon ke baad gandhi parivaar se rahul gandhyodhyage hai or upar se upi chunaav sar par hai?sadhvi-kyonki main rahul gandhi ko itnaa kah sakati hum ki jab vah banaras main baba vishwanath ke darshan kar sakate hai to unako ayodhya kii ram janm bhoomi bhi janaa chahie
 The Congress has lost its land from there, so after 24 years, he remembered Ayodhya and did not go to Ram Janmabhoomi from above
 main itnaa hi kah sakati hum ki vah kahin bhi maathaa tech le khatiya bichawa den ab koi phayda nahin
 He has been in government for 62 years
 itane lambey arase main inhen kisaan yaad nahin aayaa, naa hi garib yaad aayaa
 They kept asking for votes in the name of slogans
 raajnneetik rotiyaan sekate rahe
 Rahul Gandhi, of course, roam the streets, Congress government will not come in Uttar Pradesh
 sawaal-jab vah aaj puja karne ke baad nikal rahe the to ek samarthak ne kaha kiraahul gandhiko pradhanmantri banane kaa aashirwad de den?sadhvi-aashirwad janata kaa zyada lagata he
 Because in the field of politics, the voters are everything
 janata rupi devtaa aazaadee ke baad se yaheen padi hui he us devtaa ko vakt rahete yaad kiya hota to inako kisi se aashirwad maangane kii zarurat naa hoti
