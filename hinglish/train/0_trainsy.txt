 a photo posted by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Jul 7, 2016 at 5:11am PDT One of the major features of the politics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah is that he leaves no stone unturned to not only form the government but also to make the party inroads
 uttar-purvi rajyon, pashchim bengal, odisha jaise rajyon main jahaan party kaa koi prabhaav nahin tha vahaan pichley saadhe paanch saal main kai rajyon main bhaajapa ne sarkaar banaai or kuch rajyon main pramukh virdohi dal ke rup main takkar dene main safal rahi he
 There is definitely a South Indian state in Tamil Nadu under modi-shah's strategy, but no such opportunity could be created nor could the government form the BJP to make inroads there
 duusare shabdon main kahen to dravid raajnneeti main ghuspaith karnaa bhaajapa ke liye abhi tak sapana hi he
 However, the way the party split after the death of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, who was the head of the AIADMK, gave the BJP some power in the state
 jab modi-shah kii jodi ne annadramuk ke donon dhadon main eka karaayaa
 The AIADMK has also supported the BJP in passing the bill in Parliament, especially in the Rajya Sabha where the BJP is far from majority
 ab naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak (siabi) ne pehali baar bhaajapa ke liye vah mauka diya he jiske jariye vah tamilnadu main apni paith bana kar dhire-dhire vistaar kar sake
 Tamil Nadu BJP leaders say this indirectly
 in netaaon kaa kahana he ki rameswaram or aasapaas ke ilaake main lagbhag 1 lakh srilanka ke tamil sharnaarthi rahete hai
 Of these, about 75 thousand are living in camps and 35 thousand are living outside the camps
 srilanka main jab grihayuddh chal rahaa tha usee dauraan vahaan se ye sharnaarthi bharat aae or yahaan rahane lage
 a large number of these refugees are Tamil Dalits, backward, Buddhists, Christians and Muslims
 srilanka ke tamil kaaphi sankhya main sthaneey rojgaar main bhi chori-chhipe lage hue hai inhe sthaneey logon kaa samarthan or sahanbhuti bhi he
 With the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the way for Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka to get Indian citizenship will become easier
 aadhyatmik guru shri shri ravishankar ne in srilanka ke tamil sharnaarthiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta dene kii maang bhi kii he
 He has demanded from the government on social media platform Twitter to grant him Indian citizenship
 sutron kaa kahana he ki, centre kii modi sarkaar is disha main soch rahi he
 Its political advantage will be that by granting Indian citizenship to refugees, the BJP can garner support for itself in Tamil Nadu
 lekin tamilnadu ko lekar bhaajapa kii jo doorgaami niti (hindutv ko mudda bananaa) he uski shuruuaat is vidheyak ke jariye ho sakati he
 As per the provisions of the bill, refugees like Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis would be considered eligible for citizenship, so a Muslim refugee from Sri Lanka would be classified as an intruder
 dramuk jaisi party rajya main iske virodh main sidhe taur par utregi
 In this politics of protest and support for Tamil Muslims, this may be an opportunity for the BJP to test its Hindutva card in Tamil Nadu

 Gilchrist, however, hit the 100th six faster than mccullum
 maikulam ne 9756 gendon kaa saamana karne ke baad chhakkon kaa saikadaa banaaya jabaki gilcrist ne sirf 6796 gendon par yah mukaam hasil kiya he
 Gilchrist has hit sixes in Tests after every 68th ball, while mccullum has done so after 98th ball
 gail ne 123, kallis ne 298 or sahvaag ne 115veen gend ke baad chakka lagaaya he

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, the leader of the Congress party and a minister in the Punjab government, has given a fresh tweet in view of the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan
 navjot singh siddhu ne bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kii sthiti ko jang qaraar dete hue piem modi par ek tarah se nishaanaa saadhaa he or iskaa raajnneeti phayda uthaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Sidhu said that a war in which the king's life is not threatened is called politics, not war
 bataa den ki pulavama aatanki hamale or uske baad pakistani sarajameen par pal rahe jaish ke aatanki camp par bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke baad donon deshon ke bich tanaav kii sthiti he
 However, the release of Indian pilot Abhinandan is expected to reduce tensions between the two countries
 shuukravaar kii subah navjot singh siddhu ne ek twit kiya or usamen likhaa- 'jis jang main badshaah kii jaan ko khatra na ho, use jang nahi raajnneeti kehete he
 ~ Chanakya (chanakya)
 ' iske baad siddhu ne angreji main bhi ek line likhi he, jiskaa matlab he-yuddh ek vifal sarkaar kaa aashray he, aap apane khokhale raajnneetik uddeshyon ke liye kitne adhik nirdosh jivan or javaanon kaa balidaan karenge
 In fact, Navjot Singh Sidhu has referred to this tweet as a comment of Chanakya
 darasal, buudhvaar ko pakistan dwaara bhartiya payalat ko hiraasat main liye jane ke baad desh main kaaphi gusse kaa maahaul ban gaya tha
 India put global pressure on Pakistan and then Pakistani PM Imran Khan on Friday spoke about the release of Abhinandan
 jis jang main badshaah kii jaan ko khatra na ho, use jang nahi raajnneeti kehete he
 ~ Chanakya War is the refuge for a failed government, how many more innocent lives and jawans will you sacrifice for your hollow political motives
 Actually, Navjot Singh Sidhu has been a frequent advocate of dialogue between Pakistan and India
 pulavama hamale ke baad jab navjot singh siddhu ne kaha tha ki kuch logon kii gatividhiyon kii vajah se kisi desh ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa, is par bhi navjot singh siddhu kii jamkar aalochana hui thi
 The criticism was that Navjot Singh Sidhu had to withdraw from the Kapil Sharma Show because of this same statement
 isse pehle cricketer se netaa bane siddhu ne ‘ve haev e chwis' (hamaare paas vikalp he) sheershak ke do pej ke bayaan main kaha, ‘‘main apane is vishwaas ke saath khadaa hum ki seemaa ke andar or iske paar se sanchalit aatanki sanghathanon kii upasthiti or gatividhiyon kaa dirghakaalik samaadhaan khojane main baatcheet or kootneeti dabaav ahm bhoomika nibhaayega
 He said, "the solution to terror is peace, development and progress, not unemployment, hatred and fear
" ' unhone kaha ki vah is siddhant ke saath majbootee se khadey hai ki kuch logon kii gatividhiyon ke liye puure samudaay ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi may give the assurance of help to the farmers but the Center is not giving
 kisaanon ke muaavje kaa paisajab centre ko patr likhane se nahin mila to mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje or rajya ke aapadaa raahat mantri paisa lene swayan dilli pahunch gaye
 In fact, this is the first time in Rajasthan that 41 farmers have reported deaths due to crop failure
 vitt mantri arun jetali se lekar kendriya krishi mantri tak ne rajya kaa daura kiya lekin madad ke naam par abhi tak centre sarkaar se paise nahin mil rahe hai

 fasal kharaab hone ke baadamuaavje kii aas lagaae kisaanon kaa dhairya ab jawaab dene laga he
 Farmers are alleging that they have not yet received compensation
 yahaan tak kii jin kisaanon kii mautein hui hai, unke parivaar waalon se bhi milane prashasan kaa koi numaayinda ab tak nahi pahunchaa he
 Prem Shankar, a farmer from Ladpura in Kota, borrowed 55 bighas of land from the landlord
 iske badale jameendaar ko prati bigha 10,000 rupee dene the
 Had taken a loan of three lakh rupees for farming
 is baar fasal bahut acchhee hui thi, ummid bandhi thi ki sari udhari khatm ho jaaegi magar fasal kaatane se pehle hi sara khatm ho gaya
 When Prem Shankar went to the field, he laid his life on the tree and laid his life there
 premshankar ke pitaaji bataate hai ki abhi tak muaavja to kya, sarkaar kaa koi aadmi milane tak nahin aayaa he
 Similarly, 70-year-old Ramkaran Meena of Bundi district borrowed ten bigha fields from the zamindar
 kheti ke liye bhi ek lakh kaa karj liya tha
 When it came to harvest, hail and water destroyed the entire crop
 pump lagaakar khet se pani baahar nikaalane kii koshish main ramakaran khet main hi behosh hokar gir pare or unki maut ho gai
 Even his family has not received compensation yet
 yahi haal zyaadaatar kisaanon kaa he
 Last week saw tremendous entertainment in Bigg Boss

 During the weekend, Salman Khan fiercely introduced Siddharth Shukla's class

 Siddharth adopted this trick of Salman a few days ago during the weekend war Salman Khan gave special advice to Siddharth to control the anger
 unhone kaha tha gussa aane par let jaao, let kar saamne vaale kii baat kaa jawaab do
 In the last episode, Siddharth adopted this formula
 aseem riyaj se saath hui kahasuni main siddharth ne jameen par letkar unase maafee maangi
 On what was Siddharth upset Aseem? Actually, the Caller of the Week gave Nasimco the tag of Dagla, Palatu and Hipocrat
 aseem riyaj isi baat se naaraaz the
 They flare at Siddhartha without talking and call him doubula-palatu
 tab jakarsiddharthajameen par let jate hai or aseem kii baton kaa shanti se jawaab dete hai
 Seeing Siddharth's behavior, he tried to control his anger
 salmaan se daant khaane ke baad siddharth ne yun nikaali bhadassiddharthane apni frestrishan nikaalte hue kaha- ''logon ke saath shadyantra racho, kisi ko giraao, un logon kii gandagi main shaamil ho to bahut achche ho
 i have stood by what i said
 bolaa he us par jhagada hum
 When you have to speak for the same thing again and again, you will not get angry
 insaan kaa temper nahin looj hoga
 i have not come here to look good
 main hum aisa, main karata hum aise, kya karun main

 log in desh ke purv pradhanmantri, prakhar kavi or bijepi ke diggaj netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi ab is duniya main nahin rahe
 On Thursday, Atal Bihari Vajpayee breathed his last at AIIMS in Delhi
 vaajapeyi ke nidhan se puure desh main shok kii lahar he
 Vajpayee as the Prime Minister took many such decisions which are always remembered
 1998 main jab vaajapeyi pradhanmantri the, tab unki aguwai main bharat ne parmaanu pareekshan kiya tha
 The whole world was stunned by this decision
 11 may 1998 ko rajasthan ke pokharan main teen bamon ke safal pareekshan ke saath bharat newclear state ban gaya
 It was a proud moment for the country
 aise main agar poocha jaae ki bharat ko parmaanu raashtra banane vaala pradhanmantri koun? jawaab milegaa atal bihariwajpeyi
 However, on 19 March 1998, for the second time, Atal had to enter into agreements with several regional parties to sit on the Prime Minister's chair
 isliye bharat ko parmaanu raashtra bananaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Let us know how Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the green signal to the nuclear state during his time as PM
 1998 main bhartiya janata party ‘desh kii parmaanu niti kaa or parmaanu astron ko tainaat karne ke vikalp kaa punarmoolyankan’ karne tak ko taiyaar ho gai thi
 It also had an impact on the party's image
 april 1998 main raksha adhyayan or vishleshan santhaan (IDSA) ke nideshak jasjit singh ne kaha tha, ‘unki (bijepi kii) chhavi to aisi he ki wo maano pehla kaam hi parmaanu bam ke pareekshan kaa karenge, lekin unhone kaaphi sanyam dikhaaya he
 In such a situation, it can be said that Jasjeet Singh had no idea of the test to be held in Pokhran next month
 newclear test kaa kaam parde ke peeche jari tha
 At the same time, in 1998, Army Chief VP Malik had put the demand of the Army openly in front
 21 april 1998 ko unhone kaha tha, ‘parmaanu astron or prakshepastron kii badhati chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye sarkaar sena kii ranneetik pratirodh kshamta viksit kare
 Just two days after the demand from the Army Chief, APJ Abdul Kalam, Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defense informed the Defense Minister's committee about the nuclear project
 is samiti kii adhyakshata us samay ke rakshaamantri jorge furnandis kar rahe the
 Atal also wanted to test quickly because Pakistan, showing China's nuclear weapons, successfully tested the Gauri missile
 pakistan ke soochna mantri mushahid hossain gauri ke vikaas ko ‘dakshin asia main shakti santulan kaa prayaas’ bataa rahe the
 Apart from Gauri, Pak was also working on 'ghaznavi missile'
 vahiin china-pakistan kii santh-ganth ke alaava america or japan samet kai pashchimi desh bharat par CTBT par sin karne ke liye dabaav daal rahe the
 On that hot afternoon of May 11, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called a press conference at his official house 7 Race Course
 isi press conference main atal ne parmaanu yojana kii jaankaree di
 However, the Atal Bihari nuclear test gives credit to former PM PV Narasimha Rao
 raav ko shradhanjali dete hue atal ne kaha tha, ‘may 1996 main jab maine raav ke baad pradhanmantri kii kursi sanbhali, to unhone mujhe bataaya tha ki bam taiyaar he
 i have just exploded
 ’ asal main raav disambar 1995 main pareekshan kii taiyaari kar chuke the, lekin tab unhen kisi vajah se apana mansuba multavee karnaa padaa
 Many theories are counted behind this
 india today kii ek report daawa karti he ki bahut hi kam log is baat ko jaanate hai ki 1996 kii apni 13 dinon kii sarkaar main atal ne jo iklauta faisla kiya tha, wo parmaanu kaarykram ko hari jhandi dene kaa tha
 But when he felt that his government was not stable, he canceled this decision
 in sari ghatnaon se ek baat to tay he ki raav or atal, donon hi parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar gambhir the or har haal main pareekshan karnaa chaahate the
 Vajpayee credited this nuclear test in many of his speeches to the Chairman of the Department of Atomic Energy
 chidambaram or duusare raksha anusandhan or vikaas santhaan ke pramukh apije abdul kalam ko bhi diya
 Let us tell you that on the third day of the test on May 11, a day after Paramutest, camera teams of foreign TV networks were roaming all over Delhi
 wo pokharan pareekshan ke khilaaf pradarshan karne vaale logon ko dhund rahe the, taaki unhen bharat sarkaar kii aalochana karne kaa koi sira mili
 But alas, he did not get a chance to take a single photo
 maharashtra ke sangli jile main dasvin ke ek chaatr ne kathith rup seraiging se pareshaan hokarkhudakushi kar lee
 Sachin Javir, studying at Jawahar Navodaya Kendriya Vidyalaya in Palus village, hanged himself on a tree in the school campus
 parijanon kaa aarope he ki sachin ne raging se pareshaan hokar khudakushi kii
 Sachin's father is the headmaster of a district council school and an elder brother is also a teacher in the school itself
 parivaar hairaan he ki padhai or anya saanskrithik gatividhiyon main dilchaspee rakhane vaala yah baccha khudakushi kaise kar saktaa he
 When Sachin came to the village last holiday, the family received a letter from his bag, in which he wrote that senior students pick him up from the sleep at night and force him to dance
 yah padhakar parivaar ne skool main phone karke shikshakon se is bare main baat bhi kii, lekin unhone aisa kuch hone se inkaar kar diya
 When the holidays were over, Sachin again came to school
 magar kuch hi din baad uskaa shav ped se lataka mila
 According to the family, Sachin wanted to become a pilot
 lekin pichley kuch dinon se vah bilkul gumsum rahane laga tha
 Parivan has handed over the letter written by Sachin to the police
 isamen un aaropee senior chaatro ke bhi naam hai, jinhone uske saath raging kii
 However, the family suspects even more
 sachin ke bhai ne kaha, 'vah ped bahut hi chota he
 The branch on which the rope was hanging was so weak that my brother would have broken it with a weight of 57 kg
 mujhe is maamle par shaq he
 ' narendra modi ke farji anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) se hone ke congress ke aarope ke jawaab main gujarat sarkaar ne aaj apni do dashak puraani ek adhisuchana kaa zikr kiya jo kahati he ki modh ghaanchhi (taili) jati ko anya pichhadaa varg shrenee main shaamil kiya gaya he or isi jati se modi taalluk rakhte hai
 State government spokesperson Nitin Patel said that the social welfare department of the Gujarat government had passed a notification on July 25, 1994 which included 36 castes in the OBC category and it mentioned the Modh Ghanchi caste in number 25B, making Modi Belong to is jati ko obisi main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil had earlier said in Delhi that Modi was a fake OBC
 patel ne kaha ki yah adhisuchana 1994 main jari kii gai thi, jab congress rajya main satta main thi
 He said that when Modi's popularity is at its peak, Gujarat Congress leaders are misleading people
 rajya sarkaar aisi karrwai kii ninda karti he
 Gohil had issued a circular to the Gujarat government claiming that Modi had made some manipulations to include his caste in the OBC category after becoming the chief minister
 congress ne modi dwaara priyanka kii neech raajnneeti sambandhi tippanee kii kaat karne ke liye jati card kaa istemaal kiye jane ke baad yah hamalaa kiya tha
 Gohil said that Modi does not belong to the obcs as he is claiming to capitalize on the OBC votes
 vah dhani or samrudh modh ghaanchhi jati se taalluk rakhte hai jise modi ke mukhyamantri banane se purv na kabhi kisi prakaar ke aarakshan kaa laabh diya gaya or na hi obisi main shaamil kiya gaya

 matlab ye ki 6 november ko shradhanjali sabha hogi or sansad ke bajet satr ke dauraan ham lakhon kii taadaad main gorakshakon ko dilli bulaane par dobaaraa vichaar kar sakate hai
 Our demand is clear from the central government that if it passes the central law of cow protection, there is no question of withdrawing from that demand

 Meanwhile, Swadeshi thinker Govindacharya and his associated gosavaks have announced that a huge demonstration will be held in Delhi on 7 November at Jantar Mantar to demand a central law related to prohibition of cow slaughter
 sutron ke mutabik, aresas or viechpi se jude kai bade gorakshak sanghathan 6 november ke aayojan ko shradhanjali sabha tak simit kiye jane par khaase naaraaz bataae gaye hai
 Gosevaks say that the nature of the program has been shortened due to political reasons

 If you find three old Chinese coins from a good Feng Shui collector or shop, then tie it in red ribbon and hang it in the handle of the house
 isse ghar ke sabhi sadsy labhanvit honge
 According to the popular belief of Feng Shui, hanging coins in the handle of the main door of the house is the easiest way to bring prosperity and good fortune

 bharat main khelon kii duniya main shaayad sabase romaanchak kshan vah hota he jab ek khilaadi ritair hokar apana jimmaa agali peedi ko saunpta he
 In a relay race, the runner slows his pace by reaching full speed at the end of the specified distance so that the player waiting impatiently can complete his baton to complete the race
 pehle vaala khilaadi paseene se tar-batar, thakkar haaf rahaa hota he or aglaa khilaadi urja or josh se bharaa hota he
 The two hands holding the baton and the baton move towards each other
 byton thamane ke baad pehla khilaadi trek se hat jaataa he or aglaa khilaadi pehle vaale kii viraasat haath main lekar aage kii daud puri karne ke liye chal padataa he
 Whatever the game, the same story of the transition from one generation to another has been repeated
 aadhe dashak kii taiyaari ke baad bhartiya cricket bhi sankraman ke isi najuk kshan main pahunch gaya he
 It began in 2008 when Sourav Ganguly announced the end of his career at a press conference held at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore
 kuch hafte baad dilli ke firozshah kotla maidan main anil kumble ne apni phiraki gendon se ballebaajon ko chakma dene vaale haathon ko vishram dene kaa faisla kiya
 After this, Rahul Dravid, who was called the backbone of Indian batting in 2012, said goodbye to cricket after realizing that his game was blunt
 baad main usee saal ve
 V
 es
 When Laxman did not get any answer to his call from Captain Dhoni, he also told the world that the time has come to end his game
 lekin agali peedi ko byton thamane kaa sabase romaanchak kshan abhi kuch hafte pehle hi aayaa, jab sachin tendulkar ne cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kii
 In his farewell address at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, he said to his fellow players in a philosophical manner, "every generation gets an opportunity to take up the sport and fulfill it to the best of their ability
" mujhe aap logon par puraa bharosa he ki aap sachche man se desh kii seva karte rahenge or desh kaa naam ooncha karenge
 "now the responsibility is on you, but there is no pressure
 ham ab ek aise saal main pravesh kar chuke hai jab agali peedi apana jimmaa sanbhaalane ke liye taiyaar he
 The cricket team will become stronger one after the other
 tii20 ke dhuandhar cricket yug main paley-bade peshewar cricketron kii nai peedi ab apana jalawaa dikhaane ko taiyaar he
 Any comparison with the era of great players is meaningless, but this comparison is also natural
 cheteshwar pujaara dhairya ke maamle main pehle hi khud ko rahul dravid ke vikalp ke rup main pesh kar chuke hai
 Virat Kohli is fast emerging as a reliable batsman and is going to take the fourth order of Sachin Tendulkar in batting
 agar aap aankadon par gaur karen to sanket bahut utsahjanak hai
 Pujara 66 in his 17 Tests
 25 ke ausat se 1,590 ran bana chuke hai, jabaki dravid ne itane hi maichon main 47
 Had scored 1,150 runs at an average of 91
 viraat kohli 125 ekadivasiy maichon main 51
 He has scored 5,154 runs at an average of 54, while Sachin has 40 in the same number of matches
 02 kii ausat se sirf 4,363 ran banaae the
 But these two great players kept their place for a long time, due to which the Dravid era continued for two generations and Sachin for three generations
 isiilie agar unke kul yogadan par gaur kiya jaae to unke kad kii barabari karnaa lagbhag asambhav lagata he
 At this time, Pujara and Kohli are considered as twin pillars of India
 agar ve is saal bhi usee tarah khelte rahe, jis tarah unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi to peedhishon kaa yah sankraman ekadam sahaj rahegaa or team ko kisi tarah ke hichkolon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 Looking at the bowling front, Zaheer Khan is now at his last stop
 ve tej gendbaaji kii usee parampara main aage bade jise gadhe vakt main kapil dev ne sinchaa tha or baad main jawagal shrinath jise nai oonchaaiyon tak le gaye
 After Zaheer, Mohammed Shami has made a strong start in international cricket, but the second season is one which can make or break any fast bowler in the era of computer analysis
 aise main shami ko lekar abhi se aashwast hona thodaa jaldbaaji bharaa nirnay sabit ho saktaa he
 In the spin department, no one has come with Anil Kumble's jumbo height so far
 bharat ke is saphaltam gendbaaj ke baad ravichandran aswin ke 100 wicket hasil karne ke baavjood bharat ab bhi ek dhardaar spin gendbaaj kii talash main he, jo team main bharosa jagaa sake
 However, in the Durban Test, Ravindra Jadeja tried to arouse some confidence with his best performance, although South Africa won the match by 10 wickets
 bharat ab farvari main newjiland or garmiyon main england kaa daura karegaa
 Meanwhile, the T20 World Cup is also to be held, which will test the abilities of the Indian team
 2014 kaa saal sachin ke baad kaa saal hoga, jisamen kuch nayaa hona chahie
 By the way, Sachin himself has also been a player who after a few years has been presenting himself in a new club
 duusare khelon main bhi peedhishon ke badlaav kii yahi sthiti he
 Saina Nehwal is just 23 years old in badminton and she is called P
O
 ve
 New rival has been found in the form of Sindhu
 sindhu badi teji se sina kii uttaradhikari banane kii disha main bad rahi hai
 The 18-year-old Sindhu won the Malaysian Open competition in May
 agast main ve china kii diggaj khilaadi wang yehaan or wang zaiyang ko haraakar valrd championships main padak jeetne vaali pehali bhartiya khilaadi bani thim
 He then ended his year by winning the Macau Open in December
 2014 main ve chotii kii 10 khiladinnon main apni jagah banane ke liye kadaa muqabla karne vaali hai
 These will be things to see
 vishwa shatranj main bhi aisa hi sankraman tab dekhne ko mila jab norge ke 23 saal ke khilaadi maganas carlson ne vishwa champion rahe vishvanathan anand ko haraa diya
 Carlson has threatened to change the game itself with his new strategy
 paanch baar vishwa champion rah chuke 44 varshiya anand ko apana taj waapas paane ke liye march main rus main hone vaale candidates toornament main jeet hasil kerani hogi
 After this, Carlson will have to be defeated by a dramatic change in his style in the match to be held in November
 lekin bhartiya khel main satta kaa hastantaran prashasnic taur par bhi hona he

 Indian athlete players are still deprived of playing under national flag in international events
 2014 main asian khel or rashtramandal khel hone hai, isliye satta ke is hastantaran main zyada deree nahin kii ja sakati he
 The opposition has expressed deep indignation over the irresponsible and insensitive attitude of Delhi government on important and sensitive public interest issues like Jan Lokpal Bill
 vipaksh ne dilli ke mukhyamantri se patr likhakar maang kii he ki janalokapal bill kii file ko avilamb sadan ke patal par rakhaa jaae or jo bhi tathy hai, wo sadan ke madhyam se janata ke samaksh laae jaaen
 Leader of the Opposition Vijendra Gupta, mlas Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Jagdish Pradhan expressed their opposition by writing a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, walkout from the House and staging outside the Chief Minister's office
 vijendra gupta ne vidhansabha ke niyam 54 ke antargat bhrashtachariyon ko sangrakshan dene ke liye jaanboojhkar janalokapal bill kii file rokane kaa iljaam lagaaya or isse utpann hui sthiti par dhyanakarshan prastaav kii anumati na die jane kaa purajor virodh kiya
 Opposition parties Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Jagdish Pradhan also demanded to discuss the proposal with him
 vipaksh kaaphi samay tak vidhansabha adhyaksh celokapal bilpar charchaa kii maang karata rahaa, lekin adhyaksh ne anumati nahin di
 In protest, Vijender Gupta, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Jagdish Pradhan walked out of the House
 CM ko patr likhakar kaha- aapke gairjimmedaarana ravaiye se dilli kii janata aahatsadan se walkout karne ke baad wo mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se milakar virodh prakat karne vidhansabha sthit unke kaksh main gaye
 In the absence of Kejriwal, he sat outside the Chief Minister's room and protested till the assembly proceeded
 mukhyamantri ko likhe gaye patr main unhone sanyukt rup se likhaa ki janalokapal jaise mahatvapurn or samvedansheel janhit masale par aapke gairjimmedaarana ravaiye se dilli kii janata aahat hui he
 The whole matter of scandal regarding the file was in your cognizance, despite this, the House and the people of Delhi were misled through the House
 ham isaki kadi bhartasna karte hai, yah janata ke saath gaharaa vishwasghaat he
 The enlightened people of Delhi considered it a powerful means of freedom from corruption
 dilli kii janatane aam aadmi party par vishwaas kar aapako bahumat dekar dilli kii kaman saunpi thi lekin dukh kii baat he ki aap janata ke vishwaas par khare nahin utre
 'the government is losing its responsibility' The opposition wrote that the Janlokpal bill had raised the expectation that corruption was going to end, but after three years of your current term, the misfortune of this bill has come out, It has hit your credibility a lot
 beete 9 maheene se yah file aapke paas bevajaah padi he
 It is a shame that your entire government is shying away from its responsibility regarding the Lokpal bill
 up-mukhyamantrithatha prashasnic sudhaar mantri donon hi file ko lekar baglein jhaank rahe hai, sara maamla aapke sangyaan main he
 Despite this, there is a deliberate delay on your part
 aam aadmi party ne dilli vidhansabha main 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli janalokapal bill 2015 paarit kar dillivaasiyon main ek nai aas jagaai thi
 In a hurry, you did not follow the prescribed procedure to adopt and pass it
 vipaksh ne likhaa ki dilli janalokapal bill 2015 ko lekar aapke grih mantralay se kai baar spashtikaran hetu file kii movement hui
 On 14 September 2017, the Central Government sent this file to you for clarification
 unhone kejariwal par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki satyendra jain, dilli jal board ke ghotaalon ko ujagar na hone dene ke liye aapane qamar kas rakhi he
 Due to this, you have not taken any action against the corrupt till date
 vipaksh ne mukhyamantri se maang kii ki janalokapal bill kii file ko avilamb sadan ke patal par rakhaa jaae or jo bhi tathy hai vah sadan ke madhyam se janata ke samaksh laae jaaen, taaki doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho sake
 Leader of Opposition Vijendra Gupta said that the intention of Arvind Kejriwal is clear that the Jan Lokpal bill he had fought with is now afraid of coming exactly because Kejriwal knows that if this bill comes then his brother-in-law's relative and Satyendra Jain will be jailed Will go jaahir he jis mudde jan lokapal ko lekar arvind kejariwal ne andolan kiya or us andolan kii naav par savaar hokar satta ke shikhar tak pahunche, ab usee jan lokapal bill ko lekar vipaksh main baithi bijepi kejariwal kii raah par chalakar dharna de rahi he or mukhyamantrimanish sisodiya kah rahe hai ki unhen dharna dene dijie vah mahaj drama kar rahe hai
 So now it is certain that the way in which the political battle is going on between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP for the demand of Janlokpal, it shows somewhere that the Jan Lokpal has now become a political tool rather than honesty
 pakistani cricket team ke purv captain younus khan australia daure par team se nikaale jane par khaase naaraaz hai

 in helicopteron kii badi jarurat siachin jaise ilaakon main viviipi ko lekar jane kii bhi thi
 But on behalf of the agency, it was said that the 6000 meter latitude was reduced to 4500 thousand only so that the brokerage amount can be given to the middlemen in the same budget in which the deal was fixed
 mishael ke vakeelon kaa court main daawa he ki in sabhi badlaavon kii jaankaree kabhi mishael ke paas nahin thi
 In such a situation, how can the Indian agency prove him as a middleman
 mishael ke mutabik uskaa koi role is deal main nahin rahaa

 On Sunday, December 1, the disciples who went to the temple to perform Aarti noticed that the red sandalwood garland lying around the neck was missing, which was about 600 years old

 According to the FIR, three people came to visit the temple on Saturday afternoon
 unhone sant gopal das se bhent kii or thailand se aane kii baat bataate hue puraa parichay diya
 One of them was dressed like a lama and requested to open the temple to meditate on the site of Kabir
 teenon ek saal pehle bhi mandir main aa chuke the, isliye gopal das ne mandir kaa taala khol diya
 After a while, all three got locked and handed over the key
 thailand se aae maala-chor yojana banaakar aae the
 When one of them entered the temple on the pretext of meditation, two others kept distributing money to people outside, so that no one could pay attention to the temple

 After BJP National President Amit Shah's statement that under the leadership of the current Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the party will go to the electoral arena, all are analyzing in their own way
 nishchit rup se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke liye isse acchhee khabar nahin ho sakati kyonki bihar bijepi ke sheersh netaa susheel modi ke baad amit shah ke unke paksh main bayaan aane ke baad sab kuch saaf ho gaya he or kahin koi kanfusion nahin he
 It is also considered a setback for the Union Minister Giriraj Singh in the current political perspective
 jinako nitish kumaar ko har din gherne kii yojana par pehle kendriya netritv ne roak laga di or saath hi ab unki 'raajnneetik mahatvakanksha' bhi ab puri hoti nahin dikh rahi jo unhone apane samarthakon ke madhyam se 'giriraaj aglaa mukhyamantri' jaisaa soshal media par prachaar shuru kiya tha
 And the biggest bitter thing for Giriraj is that Sushil Modi is the last man in the party, especially in Bihar
 isliye giriraaj kaa modi ghero or nitish kumaar kaa vikalp banane kii yojana filhal dharashayi ho chuki hai
 Amit Shah's statement has also made it clear that despite the aggressive statements of some leaders, they know that the politics of Bihar are triangular in that if two parties join together to defeat one, then all the strategy fails
 iske saath hi nitish kumaar par abhi tak bhrashtachar kaa koi aarope nahin laga saktaa
 Secondly, he is one of the biggest leaders of backward castes in UP and Bihar, whose challenge is to beat a political enemy for himself
 lekin amit shah ne apane ek intervyuu main mana he ki ki kuch muddon par matbhed hai or ye nitish kumaar ko sanket hai ki saath sarkaar chalanaa to thik he lekin ye kaise hoga ki aapke pravaktaa or netaa pawan verma apane har lekh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gherenge or rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor mamata banerjee ke saath bhaajapa ko haraane kii ranniti banaaenge
 These are issues that the bjp's national leadership is not happy about
 haalanki nitish kumaar ke bare main unako jaanane vaale maanate hai kii agar prashanth kishor se bijepi ko dikkat he to shaayad wo unhen party main koi pad naa den
 Anyway, after the student union elections last year, he kept him away from the party's work because he knew that Prashant started some controversy with BJP

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday led the world's largest human chain in support of liquor ban
 kaarykram samaapt hone ke baad nitish ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan kiya or maanav shrinkhalaa kii safalataa ke bare main bataaya ki kis tarah se 3 karod logon ne isamen hissaa liya
 At the same time, journalists asked questions on the school children participating in the human series being unconscious during the program
 sawaal kaaphi sanjeeda tha, lekin nitish ne jo jawaab diya vah kaaphi atapata or betuka sa he
 Nitish said that when the Independence Day program is celebrated on August 15 at Gandhi Maidan in Patna, every time many policemen also fall unconscious during the program, in such a way that if children fall unconscious during the human chain program
 If it is done, then what is the big thing? It is worth mentioning that when the people of Bihar were creating the biggest human chain of the world under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, in support of liquor ban, they Mr
 time were reports of several districts like Samastipur, Bhagalpur, Patna, Purnia, Kaimur, fell due to strong sunlight during the 45 minutes of the human chain program for schoolchildren in Madhubani, Muzaffarpur and Rohtas unconscious
 in sabhi jagah par behosh hue bacchon ko tatkaal aspataal main bhartee karakar praathmik upachaar karaayaa gaya
 In Samastipur alone, 8 children fainted, who were admitted to Sadar Hospital for treatment
 vahiin patna ke dulhan bazaar ilaake main bhi jab kuch bachche auto rickshaw main baithkar maanav shrinkhalaa kaarykram main hissaa lene ja rahe the, to usee vakt unki auto palat gai, jisaki vajah se in bacchon ko kaaphi chot ai
 However, according to Nitish, the unconsciousness of children during the human series program is not a big deal
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'maanav shrinkhalaa kaarykram ke dauraan bacchon kaa gir kar behosh hona koi badi baat nahin he
 Every year when the program takes place at Patna's Gandhi Maidan on 15 August, during that time also many policemen who are on duty fall unconscious and this happens whenever the policemen are highly trained
 aise main agar bachche behosh ho gaye hai, to badi baat nahin he
 Nitish has claimed that more than three crore people have participated in the Human Series program and perhaps happy that Nitish felt like the unconsciousness of children during the program was disturbing in color

 5 stardiarectarashaad alibollywood ke bade binar kahani ke maamle main utane dhani nahin hai, jitne ve paise yafilmon ke bajet ko lekar
 It seems that they rely more on the stars, and less on the story
 ve apni khud kii filmon tak ko bhul jate hai ki ve is tarah kii koi film bana chuke hai
 The same is with Yash Raj Films
 is saal virjun kapur, ranvir singh or priyanka chopdake saath 'gunde' lekar aae the
 The film was also a hit
 ab aisi hi yaari dosti vah ek baar phir is film main lekar aae hai
 Ranveer Singh of 'gunday' is also in this film
 film kuch-kuch 'gunde', 'ram-balram' or yaari-dosti kii anya filmon jaisi lagati he
 The film lacks a refreshing point and the touch of Shad Ali, who gave films like 'saathiya', 'bunty Aur Babli', seems to be missing
 kahani main kitna damakahani ekadam mumbaiya style he
 Two friends are Ranveer Singh and Ali Zafar
 ve gangster bhaiyaji ke liye kaam karte hai or unki chhatrachhaaya main rahete hai
 They are doing their work with great affection at Bhaiyaji's behest, but the turning point in the story comes when Ranveer meets Parineeti Chopra
 ve uske pyaar main pad jaataa he
 The story is then woven into a fabric of friendship, loyalty and love
 aisi kai filmein aa chuki hai or is tarah kii kai kahaniyaan bhi dekhi ja chuki he
 Shad, the director of funny and interesting films like 'saathiya' and 'bunty Aur Babli', has missed something in this film
 film main dheron gane bhi hai, jo flo todate hai
 Star Appellaranvir Singh has amazing energy and tremendous timing
 hameshaa kii tarah unhone apane kirdaar ko parade par jeene ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi he
 Ali Zafar is also in his role and has tried to give his hundred percent
 pariniti chopra bhi thik he
 But his flirtatious style has become a bit more in every film now
 jahaan tak baat govinda kii he to ve ek achche actor hai, film main unhen dekhne ko man karata he
 Even in the negative style, they do not look very negative
 film kaa koi bhi kairactor majbootee se ubharkar nahin aata he
 Earn Ki Baat 'KILL DIL' is a poorly written story and a poorly made film
 film ko lekar diarector kaa vijan saaf nahin ho paata he or film ko dekhte hue har baar dil kil hota najar aata he
 The only life of the film is Ranveer Singh
 lekin abhi ve us kad ko hasil nahin kar sake hai ki ve apane dam par kharaab kahani vaali film ko lanbaa safar tay karvaa saken
 Anyway, the film does not seem to be connected like that to the current era

 Taking a dig at the BJP, Kejriwal alleged that the BJP is putting a hurdle in this scheme to be implemented for the poor
 kejariwal ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki puri dilli dekh le ki kis besharmi se bijepi dilli ke garibon kii 'ghar ghar rashan' skim roak rahi he
 Remember this next time you go to vote
 centre sarkaar or uparajyapal ke saath kejariwal kii ladaai services vibhaag ko lekar he or kejariwal kaa aarope he ki isi adhikaron kaa istemaal kar uparajyapal sidhe-sidhe afasaron ko kaam karne se roak rahe hai
 Kejriwal wrote quoting a news that this (from the news) would clearly show the jugalbandi between the officer and LG

 Kejriwal wants to send ration to the poor from house to house by fixing the ration system in Delhi before the elections
 sarkaar ke mutabik rashan kii vitaran paddati main itani khamiyaan hai jisase bhrashtachar ko badhaava mil rahaa he saath hi garibon ko pareshaan hona padataa he
 In such a situation, the situation of moving the files related to this scheme from one department to another has once again created a dispute between the government and the officials

 chargeshit main adwani or sangh parivaar ke duusare netaaon ke khilaaf vivaadit dhaancha giraaye jane kii sajeesh rache jane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, in February 2001, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court called the transfer of FIR No
 198 from Rae Bareli to Lucknow technically incorrect as the state government had not taken permission from the Chief Justice of the High Court
 haalanki aapraadhik sajeesh kii dhara hathaaye jane ko lekar hycourt ne koi tippanee nahin kii thi
 The UP government did not correct the technical mistake and the FIR No
 198 case went back to Rae Bareli Court
 4 may 2001 main lakhanu kii sibiai court ke special jaj shrikant shukla ne adwani or 20 anya netaaon ke khilaaf aapraadhik sajeesh kii dhara hataa di kyonki exiaar 197 sirf babari masjid ke vidhwans ko lekar thi naa ki aapraadhik sajeesh ko lekar

 Advani and the rest of the leaders were demanding that the petition be dismissed as the basis for the delay in filing the petition, but the court rejected the demand
 sibiai ke alaava ek yachikakarta haji mehboob ne bhi supreme court main arji lagaakar kaha tha ki 2014 main centre main sarkaar badalane ke baad sibiai apana rukh badal sakati he
 Accused of BJP and Sangh should be prosecuted under criminal conspiracy

 The Indian National Lok Dal says that the action the government is taking against Hooda under pressure from the Supreme Court is insufficient
 hooda ne 10 saal mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue jameenon ke aavanton main kai bade ghotaale kiye hai or ab bhi kai maamalon kii jaanch jaan-boojhkar khatter sarkaar nahin kara rahi he
 Chautala said, investigation of all these cases should be entrusted to CBI
 haryana ke CM manohar laal khatter ko pataa he ki unke tamaam mantri hi bhrasht hai, isi vajah se vah purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke jameen aavanton ke ghotaalon ke maamle kii jaanch thik se nahin kara rahe or unhen bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the Congress kept accusing the government of framing false cases against Bhupendra Singh Hooda and framing them
 haryana vidhansabha main congress vidhayak dal kii netaa kiran choudhary ne aarope lagaaya ki raajnneetik dwesh ke chalate hooda ke khilaaf jameen aavanton ke kai maamle darj kara die hai or in maamalon main kuch bhi dam nahin he
 CBI is under investigation in these 6 cases against Hooda
 panchakula kaa ageel plot aavanton maamla2

 manesar main jameen adhigrahan ghotaalaa4
 An investigation is already going on with the CBI in the case of Raxil Purchase
 rohtak main udaar gagan properties ko di gai kareeb 280 acre jameen kaa maamla6
 CBI is also investigating the land acquisition case in Sonepat
 khatter sarkaar kaa kahana he ki bhupendra singh hooda ne mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue jameen aavanton ke dauraan jo dhaandhliyaan or ghotaale kiye hai unki jaanchasupreme courtke nirdesh ke baad CBI ko saunpi gai he
 Earlier, on the report of the Dhingra Commission, the Haryana government has started investigating all these land allocation cases with the CBI
 haryana ke cabinet mantri captain abhimanyu ne kaha ki hooda ke khilaaf ek ke baad ek jameen aavanton ke maamalon ke dauraan ghotaalon or dhaandhliyon kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 For this reason, a CBI inquiry has also been started against him, but all these cases have taken a political form
 isi vajah se haryana main chal rahe vidhansabha bajet satr ke dauraan haryana kii raajnneeti puri tarah se garma chuki he

 iskaa udhaaharan he 19 saal simon biles
 Who is Simone: Simone, 4 feet 8 inches, is a black gymnast in America
 simon kaa jimnastic se pyaar 6 saal kii umr main shuru hua tha, jab vah ek gym gai thim
 It is not an easy thing to dream of becoming a gymnast by taking short steps
 lekin simon ko koi roak na sakaa
 Achievements: The 1984 Summer Olympic Keagold medalist Mary Lou Retton called Simone the best gymnast in history
 is baat main koi do raay bhi nahin he
 Simone became the gymnast at the age of 19 to win the highest gold medal in the history of the World Championship
 unka signechar move half twist ke saath dabl leout or blind landing he
 No one else could repeat his move in 2013
 is move ko ab ofishili 'da biles' ke naam se jaanate hai
 Regarding her famous style, Simone says, 'many of my friends try to do this
 lekin wo land nahin kar pate
 Due to which they become depressed
 '13 gold medlas or 14 world championships jithisimon kii coach boorman kahati hai, 'jo skills seekhney main dusron ko saalon lag jate hai, wo simon teen dinon main sikh jaati hai
 Simone, who has won 13 gold medals and 14 world championships so far, is now eyeing the Rio Olympics
 unki pratibha kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki log unke bare main kehete hai ki wo rio olympic main paanch gold medal jeetengi
 How confident his team is with Simone can be gauged from the fact that shortly before the start of the Olympic Prelims round, all the team members in the cafe were laughing
 unke maathe par chintaa kii ek lakeer nahin thi
 What could be the cause of this
 ji haa, iskaa kaaran he simon
 Why worry when a player like Simone is in the team? bachapan kii yadenitani kam umr main hi simon kai utaar-chadhaav se gujri hai
 Simone's mother was a drug addict
 wo simon or unki bahan kaa khyaal nahin rakh paa rahi thim, isliye simon ke grandeparents ne simon or unki bahan ko god le liya
 Simone calls her Grandmother "mom"
 jimnast kii duniya ke diggajon kaa kahana he ki abhi simon jaisaa jimnast koi nahin he
 Serving people by becoming nurses is a different objective
 haalanki unhen khud par kaaphi garv he lekin ritairement ke baad wo ek nurse ban logon kii seva karnaa chaahati hai

 Since demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been consistently advocating cashless transactions and also making people aware to use the card instead of cash, but the capital of the country, Delhi, where the number of educated people is relatively small
 Merchants in the US are a bit uneasy about the cashless payment system
 piem kii apil ke baad puraani dilli ke un bazaaron main jaakar padtaal kii to zyaadaatar vyapaaricashles systemko lekar dare dikhe
 The biggest question of the traders was that how would they pay the workers who brought their goods from the factory, bus stand, railway station or other markets without cash
 vyapaariyon ke saamne sabase badi chintaa ye he ki puraane vyapaariyon se jinase wo saamaan laate hai unamem se zyaadaatar pement cash se hoti he cash naa hone kii haalat main wo kabhi-kabhi chack ke liye bhi maan jate hai lekin zyaadaatar vakt unhe cash pement hi karnaa hota he
 Apart from this, cashless trading is almost impossible if you are a rickshaw puller or you take payment in cash only from all the merchants with loading autos
 iske alaava cashlas vyapaar kaa ek or dar jovyapaariyonko sata rahaa he wo he kai baar thapp hone vaala sarwar yaa phir graahak kii choti si chook kaa
 Traders say that due to the server down several times, the customer is not able to pay on time
 iske alaava card se bhugtan main kai baar rupye vakt par dukandaar ke khate main nahin pahunch pate
 It is not that only the merchants are worried about the cashless system
 dukandaaron ke alaava graahak bhi cashles system se kataraa hi rahe hai
 According to customers, they have seen and read the news of cloning of debit and credit cards many times and hence do not consider payment from the card completely secure
 baharhaal, sarkaar kii koshish he ki log ab batue se i-batue par aaen lekin itane bade desh main jahaan lagbhag 80 fisadi se zyaada kaa vyapaar nagdi main hota he vahaan logon ko cash se nikaalkar cashles system main laana aasaan to katai nahin hoga

 It is worth noting that till now, gold traders always had to face losses due to fluctuations in the international market of gold

 -input bhashaa The jamaat-ud-dawa (JUD) has once again warned India to stop building dams on the rivers coming towards Pakistan, saying that if it does not, then the responsibility to settle the matter has been given to the Kashmiri Mujahideen
 Go jeyudi kii baithak main is mudde par baat hui
 Representatives of the main political parties also attended the meeting
 baithak main sarkaar se maang kii gai ki vah yaa to bharat ko in nadiyon par baandh banane se roke, nahin to ‘kashmiri mujahidinon’ ke ‘haath khol’ de, taaki ve is mudde se nipat len
 When the government remained silent on the water issue, the JUD attacked it fiercely
 jeyudi ne kaha ki pani kii aapurti roak kar bharat kii yojana pakistan ko somalia or ithiopia kii tarah aarthik rup se tabah karne kii he
 Following the meeting, a joint declaration was issued by the JUD, demanding that the Government of Pakistan 'keep the option of using force open' if the Indian government does not stop working on these projects
 ‘sarvadaleey sammelan’ ke naam se yojit kii gai baithak main sattadhari pakistan pipuls party, piemail-en, jamaat-e-islamic or imran khan kii party taharik-e-insaaf ke pratinidhiyon ne bhi bhaag liya
 The JUD has demanded that if the Government of Pakistan cannot stop India from building the dam, it should hand over this responsibility to the Kashmiri Mujahideen

 According to the statement, "pakistan's silence rather than blaming it on India's stand is regrettable
" ’ isamen kaha gaya he ‘sabhi mantri or adhikari, jo is mudde par bharat kii jubaan bol rahe hai, unhen desh se maafee maangani chahie or desh ke hiton kii keemat par bharat ke saath ekapaksheeya mitrataa ke is rukh ko turant khatm karnaa chahie
 The JUD claimed that the silence of global bodies such as the United Nations and the World Bank on the issue is a question mark on 'their non-discrimination stance'
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat pakistan ke praanton ko ‘pani ke mudde par aapas main ladvane kii sajeesh’ rach rahaa he
 According to the statement, the government should prioritize 'kashmir and water issues' in negotiations with India
