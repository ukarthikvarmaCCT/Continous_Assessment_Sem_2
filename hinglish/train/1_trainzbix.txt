 Has the number of Sanskrit students decreased
 17 july, 2017 ko jawaab dete hue maanav sansaadhan rajya mantri doctor mahend nath pandeya ne kaha ki mantralay skulon or collejon main sanskrit padhaane vaale shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin rakhata he
 According to available information, there has been no decrease in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke paas jab shikshakon kii sankhya kaa record nahin he to phir kya he
 Nevertheless, the Minister is saying that there has been no reduction in the posts of Sanskrit teachers
 hamane kai jagah dekha ki sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 There has also been a decrease in students
 banaras ke sampoornanand sanskrit universti main bhi sanskrit ke shikshak kam hai
 The Chancellor of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan also believes that the teachers are few
 rashtriya sanskrit shiksha santhaan ke paas sanskrit ke vikaas ke liye puraa charter he
 Even after this, a second Sanskrit Commission was formed for the development of Sanskrit, whose report has been submitted at the time of NDA
 nae chairman kii report main kaha gaya he ki alag-alag rajyon main nai sanskrit uniwarsity ke liye ekamusth grant diya jaae
 Grant should be given for the skill development course in all Sanskrit universities
 aadhunik vishyon ko shuru karne ke liye vishesh rup se grant diya jaae
 Sanskrit atmosphere should be created in the campus
 saadhaaran sanskrit main shastron kii padhai ho
 Like Tamil, Hindi, Urdu University, subjects like history, social science, science and commerce should be taught
 biessi, emessi jaise course sanskrit main bhi bane
 All these improvements are given about Indian languages to create employment opportunities in them
 is baar ke bajet main hindi nideshaalay ke liye 46 karod die jane kaa prastaav to dikhaa he, sanskrit ke liye alag se grant kii ghoshnaa nazar nahin ai
 It seems that the report of the Second Sanskrit Commission has not been taken seriously
 agar aapako pataa ho ki upi ke phirozabad ke sirsaganj kasbe ke is sanskrit college kaa kya hoga, iske bare main sanskrit ayog main kuch nahin he

 80 ke dashak tak yahaan 300 ke kareeb chaatr hua karte the, is samay sirf 7 chaatr hai
 For this, there is a teacher whose salary is sent by the government and there are three employees

 It seems that no one is going to see how to use the government's resources better
 1978 main is santhaan ke sansthaapak kii zamin vivaad main hatya ho gai thi
 The comments in bekaar pade sansadhano kaa istemaal bhi sanskrit ke vikaas main ho saktaa tha, magar uske liye zaruri he ki kaam ho
 BJD MP from Puri Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra had asked that in the last ten years the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit has come down drastically due to lack of job opportunities, is this correct? kya sanskrit chaatro kii sankhya main kami ai he
 Replying on 17 July 2017, Minister of State for Human Resources, Dr
 Mahendra Nath Pandey said that the Ministry does not keep a record of the number of teachers teaching Sanskrit in schools and colleges
 uplabdh soochna ke anusaar sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he
 What is there when the Ministry of Human Resources does not have a record of the number of teachers
 phir bhi mantri ji kah rahe hai ki sanskrit shikshakon ke padon main koi kami nahin ai he

 If you know what will happen to this Sanskrit college in Sirsaganj town of Firozabad, UP, there is nothing in the Sanskrit Commission
 jo college band ho chuke hai yaa band hone ke kagaar par hai, unki zameenon yaa sansadhano kaa kya hoga, is par bhi kuch nahin he
 Arya Gurukul Sanskrit College has turned into ruins

 There used to be around 300 students till the 80s, at present there are only 7 students
 inke liye ek shikshak hai jinka vetan sarkaar bhejti he or teen karmchaaree bhi hai
 One teacher for seven students
 lagata he ki koi dekhne vaala nahin ki sarkaar ke sansadhano kaa kaise behatar istemaal kiya jaae

 There is a lot of news nowadays from the Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), a government institution that is generally far from being discussed
 apane ko zyada aadhunik banane ke saath hi yah apane lakhon sadasyon kii apane tak pahunch bhi aasaan bana rahaa he
 Commissioner of EPFO
 ke
 Jalan spoke to Money Today's Deepak Mandal about his priorities
 pesh hai pramukh anshaipiefo ne nai technology ke sahare kai badlaav kiye hai
 These include online balance and claim status
 in sab par karmchaariyon or amployrs kii kya pratikriya he?itane saal main bada badlaav electronic chaalaan-ritern kaa he
 It is useful for both employees and employees
 isse pehle amployrs ko paanch alag ritern bharne padate the
 Now they just have to file a return and that too electronically
 karmchaariyon kii rakam sidhe unke khate main jaati he
 Now they can see the deposits in their accounts online
 isse hamaara kaam bhi aasaan ho jaataa he kyonki ham dekh sakate hai ki kitne pratishthanon ne chaalaan bharaa he or kitne karmchaariyon ke liye bharaa he
 Many more systems have been included in the invoice set-up, such as annual account upgrades, online transfers
 ipief khate chalaanaa sevings bank account chalaane jitna aasaan ho saktaa he?isamen samay lagegaa lekin hamaara iraadaa yahi hona chahie
 If we do not do this, we will not be able to give the best service
 hamen aaj nahin to kal us level tak pahunchane kii koshish kerani chahie
 What needs to be done to get there? Today the EPFO employer is focused
 yani amploir hi karmchaariyon ko provident fund number detaa he
 We have to take this responsibility
 karmchaariyon ko pief sankhya hamen khud deni hogi
 We have to give employees universal numbers and separate accounts
 aglaa saal ipiefo ke liye chunauti bharaa hoga
 Employees of EPFO should understand that many private companies will come into this sector after the pension bill is passed
 ve apane saath nai technology laaengi
 If the EPFO does not improve the technology then it will be defeated
 ipiefo ko badalte maahaul main dhalanaa hoga
 That is why i say that the next one year will be challenging and we should face the challenge as soon as possible
 kya iskaa matlab yah ki ipiefo ko karmchaariyon se sidhe sampark sadhana chahie?mere kehane kaa matlab yah he ki hamen aisi raah nikaalani chahie, jiske jariye ham karmchaariyon se sidhe samvaad kar saken
 That is why we are talking about universal provident fund number
 vyakti kahin bhi kaam kare, uskaa yah number vahi rahe
 Is there any progress in this direction? Some progress has been made, we are trying something
 isse pehle bhi teen-chaar baar hamane ye number jari karne kii koshish kii he
 There are many centralized / decentralized ways of doing this
 technology, prashasan or kanoon se judi kai chunautiyaan hai
 We also have to take a lot of clearances
 matlab hamen yojana main sanshodhan kii manjuuri leni hogi, jo mantralay degaa
 i need technology to do this and the staff will have to take along
 pichley saal ipiefo kii ek bhitari adhisuchana ne vetanbhogiyon main halchal paidaa kar di ki ipief anshdaan sirf basic pe par nahin, kul vetan par aadhaarit hona chahie
 Right now, even though this issue has been put on hold, some way has to be found out
 vah rasta kya hoga?aap 30 november, 2012 ke circular kii baat kar rahe hai
 He is still in the ministry
 isse kanoon main koi badlaav nahin hua he
 That is an interpretation of the law which the Madras High Court has done
 phir bhi kuch logon ko laga ki yah koi badlaav he, lekin aisa nahin he
 However, the matter is in the ministry and he will think about it
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki iskaa asar 6,500 ru
 Will not affect the employees receiving basic salary more than Rs
 Why should it be affected? If your basic salary is Rs 6,500
 se zyada he to iskaa asar aap par nahin hona chahie
 The contribution to EPF is largely voluntary anyway
 ipiefo ke paas aane kii jarurat hi nahin he
 Some experts say that once joined EPF, they are always a part of it
 aisa nahin he
 The point is that if the basic salary is Rs 6,500
 se kam rahete hue aap ipief main hai to phir basic selary 6,500 se upar ho jane bhi isse jude phaaydon se aapako vanchit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 So it is said that once you join EPF, you will always be in it
 iskaa makasad yah he ki amployrs karmchaariyon ko ipief ke laabh se vanchit rakhkar kanoon kaa galat istemaal na kar saken
 If you leave the organization once, then you are no longer a member of the EPF
 phir do maheene ke baad aapane kisi or kii naukari kar lee to ipiefo ko kaise pataa chalegaa?20 se zyada karmchaariyon vaali companiyon ke liye ipiefo kaa sadsy hona kya anivaary nahin he?haa, jaruri to he, lekin ve hameshaa kah sakate hai ki unke karmchaariyon kaa mul vetan 6,500 ru
 Exceed and can avoid contribution
 unhen sirf prashasnic shulk dena hoga
 There are many organizations that are paying this fee
 yah behad kam yani sirf saat ru
 is
 ham isamen sanshodhan karne vaale hai
 What will be the new fee? First we have to try to amend the law
 iskaa prastaav shram mantralay ko jayega
 6,500 Rs
 kii seemaa badaye jane kii bhi charchaa he, kya aisi koi yojana he or agar he to kitni or kab tak ?haa, yah seemaa badhaane kii yojana he, ise badhaakar 10,000 ru
 Doing cabinet note is carried forward
 ham to iesai (karmchaaree rajya beemaa) yojana kii tarah ise badhaakar 15,000 ru
 Seeking to do
 is par bahut charchaa hui he, lekin yah kanoonee maamla he
 As the head of EPFO, i believe that the limit should be increased, but when it will happen, i do not know
 central board of trustees ne haal main ipief kii raashi ko invest karne ke niyamon main dheel di he
 Now you can invest in long-term PSU bonds with private bonds with AAA rating
 isse kamai kitni badhegi?sarkaar yahi chaahati he
 Our intention is to have two-way gains - one is to take more returns and at the same time preserve the fund
 ab bharat sarkaar kii pratibhutiyon main hamaara investment kam hoga
 Investment in state securities will also be lower, while investment in government and private sector bonds may increase, as government and private sector bonds offer higher returns
 isliye kamai badaae kii ummid he
 Ever since the new pension scheme (NPS) has been opened for all, the comparison of NPS and EPF / EPS has started
 aapke khyaal main kya yah sahi he? aap donon kii tulana kaise karenge?pichley chaar saal (may, 2009 se may, 2013) main vaarshik aadhaar par hamaara ritern enpies se behatar rahaa
 We have 10
 47 pratishat kaa ritern diya he, jabaki enpies kii centre or rajya sarkaar kii yojanaon ne kramshah 9
 85 and 9
 17 pratishat kaa ritern diya he
 i am happy to say that EPF is giving good returns
 isamen nikasi par tex se chhot he, jabaki enpies main philhal yah suvidha nahin he
 How will the pension bill change the environment? The introduction of private pension funds may not affect voluntary contributions
 ipiefo ko behatar sarvice deni hogi
 There were some serious issues about the EPF service
 ham apni sarvice sudhaar rahe hai or aise hi sudhaarte rahe to aisi koi vajah nahin ki ritenrs ke maamle main bhi privet pension funds se takkar na le saken
 NPS is trying to involve corporate houses and their staff
 usamen amployrs ke jariye anshdaan dene vaale karmchaariyon ke liye atirikt tex laabh kaa prastaav bhi he
 NPS can challenge EPF? As far as tax benefits are concerned, i cannot say anything, but i take the competition with NPS positively
 main apane adhikariyon se yahi kahata hum ki hamen apni sevaayen sudharni hongi
 Till now we have been doing well, but all that under the legal system
 hamen is soch se baahar nikalnaa hoga or sarvice ke maahaul main kaam karnaa hoga
 Will the EPF amount be invested in equity? The Finance Ministry has no objection to investing 5-15 per cent of the fund equity, but the Central Board of Trustees has imposed strict conditions for companies in which EPF may be invested
 isliye bahut kam vikalp maujuud hai
 Apart from this, in the current environment, we do not have the courage to invest in our market
 lekin main yah nahin kahata ki ipief kabhi equity main invest nahin hoga
 It will be difficult to get good debt instruments when our fund size will increase further, then we will have to invest in equity
 isliye main yah nahin kahata ki ham equity main kabhi invest nahin karenge

 police ne ajay kataara ko gajiabad se giraftaar se kiya, jabaki uskaa kahana he ki property dealer dharmendra yadav ne jaan se maarane kii koshish kii
 Deputy Commissioner of Police Vijay Bhushan said that Ajay Katara kidnapped Dharmendra Yadav on Thursday night but the patrolling police rescued him after he heard the noise
 haalanki, gasht kar rahi police ne donon ko chhod diya
 Dharmendra Yadav then filed a complaint letter against Ajay Katara and demanded his arrest
 ajay kataara kaa kahana he ki mujhe jaanboojhkar nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Police is helping Dharmendra Yadav at the behest of DP Yadav, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party ruling in Uttar Pradesh, whose son and nephew Nitish Katara are guilty in the murder case

 In Uttarakhand in the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the BJP has set a record under the leadership of CM Trivendra Singh Rawat
 is rajya main pichley 19 saalon se ek myth chalaa aa rahaa tha
 The state has held Lok Sabha elections four times since the formation of Uttarakhand
 dilachasp baat ye he ki rajya main jis party kii sarkaar rahati he, loksabhaa chunaav main us party ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padataa he
 But the Uttarakhand BJP has managed to change this pattern
 2019 kii modi lahar main jiti paanchon sichlmoda se ajay tamta ne congress ke pradeep tamta ko 2

 After months of stalemate on Doklam and stern action by India, China has now understood that it is not 1962 India
 idhar bharat ne china ko kai achche sanket bhi die hai
 So now this visit of PM Modi can start a practical relationship between the two countries
 piem modi ke liye yah ek bada daanv ho saktaa he
 After losing a battle to China in 1962, we have stood again with full force

 uski mrityu ko "kaarysthal durghatana" qaraar diya gaya
 According to Fox News, a Paris court ruled that the firm should pay compensation to the family of an employee who suffered a heart attack while having sex while going on a business trip to a railway company
 shaks kaa naam em
 Xavier is wo railway construction company 'tieso' main kaam karata tha
 Xavier went to Laureate in 2013 for a business trip
 jahaan usne anjaan mahila ke saath sex kiya tha
 During a relationship, he suffered a heart attack and died
 paris apil kii adaalat ne unki mrityu ko is saal may main "kaarysthal durghatana" qaraar diya
 Her lawyer Sarah Ballut posted a copy of it on linkedin last week
 company ne adaalat main tark diya ki em jevier kii yon gatividhi kaam kaa hissaa nahin thim
 Also, since the man died in a different hotel, he was not assigned
 company ne karmchaaree kii maut par kaha- 'unhone kaam ko baadhit kar vyaktigat ruchi dikhaai
 Because of this, he was not on a business trip
 'company ne yah bhi kaha ki uske karmchaaree kii maut kaa kaam se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Rather he formed relations with an unknown woman
 adaalat ne kaha ki yon kriya "rozmarra kii jindagi kaa maamla he, jaise showers yaa bhojan lenaa
 The court has directed the company to pay compensation to the employee's family
 kya aam aadmi party (AAP) gujarat chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf congress ko andarkhaane madad karne kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he? party ke gujarat prabharee gopal raay kaa vaise to kahana he ki AAP rajya main vot kaatane ke liye nahin balki badlaav ke liye chunaav ladegi lekin saath hi ve kehete hai ki jahaan party ke majboot ummidavaar nahin honge vahaan bijepi ke khilaaf sabase shashakt ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye jor lagaaya jayega
 In a conversation with Aaj Tak, Gopal Rai clearly said that the AAP would not be deterred from supporting the Congress's clean-faced faces
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye pehali baar maidan main utar rahi AAP ne tay kiya he ki vah sabhi siton par nahin balki rajya kii unheen siton par chunaav ladegi jahaan par party kaa sanghathan booth str tak maujuud or majboot hoga
 Gopal Rai, a minister in the Delhi government, will go down to defeat the BJP, saying that he will go to the polls in Gujarat to defeat the BJP, not to cut votes against the BJP
 gopal raay kaa kahana he ki jin siton par aam aadmi party kii sthiti behatar nahin he or jahaan par use booth str tak sanghathan hasil nahin he vahaan par vah apane ummidavaar utaar kar bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaale voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin karnaa chaahati
 In such seats, the AAP will support and help whatever strong candidate is against the BJP
 chaahe ye ummidavaar nirdaleey hon yaa phir kisi or party se taalluk rakhte hon
 AAP wants to help the Congress? When asked Gopal Rai that the party is not wanting to directly help the Congress directly in Gujarat? To this question, Gopal Rai said, "the election of Gujarat is the BJP versus the people of Gujarat
 congress apane balboote gujarat vidhansabha chunaav nahin jeet sakati
 The people of Gujarat are standing by to defeat the BJP and it will win every candidate who will be seen to challenge the BJP candidate strongly
 aise main jin vidhansabha siton par AAP kii sthiti majboot hogi vahaan gujarat kii janata hamaare ummidavaaron ko jitaayegi
 Where the independents or other party's clean image candidates will be in strong position, AAP will help them
 party aisi siton par vot katkar haragij phayda nahin pahunchaayegi
 "AAP will suffer double loss due to not contesting elections
 Sources associated with AAP say that it is also a compulsion of the party to contest the Gujarat assembly elections because it is difficult to spread the organization in the state without contesting the elections and the organizations formed in the last 3 years by not contesting the elections
 Can cause damage
 isliye aam aadmi party gujarat main ek tir se do nishaanaa saadhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The first attempt is that by contesting elections, its expansion in other states should be large and the organization strong, as well as the second attempt is to help other candidates who are likely to win, instead of dividing votes against BJP
 aise main saaf he ki bijepi ye aarope apane sir nahin lenaa chaahati ki usne gujarat main vot kaat kar bijepi kii madad kii
 The party's Gujarat unit is also in touch with Patidar leaders and Dalit activists like Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani
 kisi se bhi gathbandhan nahin karegi aaptaaf ne gujarat main chunaav se purv kisi bhi tarah ke gathbandhan kii sambhaavna se saaf inkaar kiya he
 Gopal Rai hinted at releasing the first list of his candidates after Diwali
 gopal raay ke mutabik gujarat kii lagbhag 150 vidhansabha siton par party ne focus kiya he
 According to sources, the Election Committee of the AAP in Gujarat has sent a list of candidates to the party's PAC, which will be stamped by the party's highest unit (PAC) after Diwali
 haalanki kitni siton par aam aadmi party gujarat main chunaav ladegi iskaa khulaasa party abhi nahin kar rahi he lekin gopal raay kii maane to un tamaam siton par bijepi ko takkar denge jahaan party kaa sanghathan booth str tak majboot hoga or jahaan par ve bijepi ko haraane kii kshamta rakhte honge
 Will Kejriwal campaign in Gujarat? Will Arvind Kejriwal campaign for the party in Gujarat? Gopal Rai did not give a clear answer to this question
 unka kahana he ki kejariwal dilli ke mukhyamantri hone ke naate philhal dilli par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai jo ki party kii pehali jimmedaari he
 In such a situation, when the party needs them in other states, they will definitely be requested to campaign
 sutron ke mutabik kejariwal 5 november ko bhopal main aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta sammelan main shaamil honge or sutron kii maane to isi taarikh ko kejariwal madhyapradesh main agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul bhi bajaaenge
 Gopal Rai says that the Aam Aadmi Party will contest elections in states where it has the ability to form an organization and where the party is expected to win the election instead of contesting it indiscriminately

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal held special talks with Aaj Tak on the matter of granting full statehood status to Delhi
 kejariwal is maang ko lekar 1 march se anischitkaaleen upwas par ja rahe hai
 Read what he said in his entire interview- 1- Arvind Kejriwal said that the people of Delhi have been being fooled for 70 years
 1949 main puure desh main janatantr aayaa, lekin dilli ke saath aisa nahin he
 People here choose their government, but the government does not have the strength
 2- dilli ke purv mukhyamantriyon shila dikshit, madan laal khurana yaa sahib singh verma ke paas bhi puri takat nahin thi
 Madanlal Khurana had said in the assembly that the strength of the Chief Minister of Delhi is not even equal to that of a peon
 yah bayaan darj he
 He too had raised the voice for a full state
 3- atal bihari vaajapeyi dilli ko purna rajya banane kaa kanoon lekar aae the, lekin sansad kaa kaarykaal puraa ho gaya to kanoon bhi khatm ho gaya tha
 Sheila Dixit also voiced this for 15 years
 4- shila ji ke paas zyada takat thi
 She could transfer to any Delhi official
 vah tay kar sakati thim ki dilli kaa ajukeshan, health or chif secretary koun banegaa
 3 months after forming our government, Modi government snatched all the power from us by issuing a notification
 ab ye kaam centre sarkaar tay karti he
 Now when Manish Sisodia does a good job, the central government changes the education secretary and puts the most corrupt man there
 5- in sabake baavjood hamane shiksha, swasthya, bijli or pani ke kshetra main krantikari faisle kiye, jo 70 saal main kisi bhi sarkaar ne nahin liye
 Even 15 years of government in a state did not have as many jobs as we worked in four years
 hamaare paas jitani takat thi, hamane usase hi kaam kiya
 6- On the day Delhi got full state status, every family in Delhi will give one house each in ten years
 dilli ko builder mafia se mukt kar diya jaae to sabko ghar mil saktaa he
 University has not been established in Delhi for years
 hamane modi sarkaar se kaha tha ki hamen college kholane hai, uniwarsity banane kii ijaajat di jaae
 There was no decision in three years
 aaj dilli main 95 fisadi number laane vaale bacchon ke maa-baap pareshaan ho jate hai, kyonki yahaan padhane ke liye college hi nahin hai
 7- We wanted to install CCTV cameras in Delhi, for three years the Modi government sat down with the file
 main ladakar file sin karwaakar laayaa
 CCTV cameras will be installed in Delhi from next week
 manish sisodiya ko file sin karaane ke liye alji ke ghar par dharna dena padaa
 He did not go there to get his child admitted or for a job
 file sin karwaane gaye the
 8- The country's compulsion is necessary to defeat the BJP
 ham kuch bhi satta ke liye nahin kar rahe hai
 Our only goal is to defeat Amit Shah and Modi
 congress or aam aadmi party kaa gathbandhan nahin ho rahaa he aisa mujhe lagata he
 If both of us had come together, BJP would have been wiped out but now we will give a tough fight
 aaj desh ke liye agar aam aadmi party band kerani pade to main chaar minute main ise band kar duungaa
 i am a patient of sugar, yet i am sitting on a fast i
e
 i am putting my life at stake
 amit shah or modi ko haraane ke liye koi bhi pradhanmantri ban jaae yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 He has crossed the country's fleet in five years
 9- aaj dilli main do lakh naukari nikal sakati he, lekin yah mere haath main nahin he
 Modi government is in the hands
 agar dilli purna rajya ban jaae to main do lakh logon ko turant sarkari naukari de saktaa hum
 10- My fast is to organize the people of Delhi for the movement of the full state
 meraa andolan kisi sarkaar se koi maang karne ke liye nahin he
 Parliament is ending
 koi sarkaar hi nahin bachi he to hamaari kisi se koi maang nahin he
 The movement is starting from a march
 yah aage tarah-tarah se jari rahegaa
 This movement will continue till Delhi is made a full state
 11- is samay centre main halaat aise hai ki agar hamaare saat saansad ban gaye to hamaare paas bahut takat hogi
 My heart says that with the arrival of seven mps, Delhi will get full statehood within two years
 12- bijepi or congress ne kai saalon se dilliwaalon ko dhokhaa diya he
 i feel very sad to see this
 sahib singh verma ke bete pravesh verma or madanlaal khurana ke bete harish khurana purna rajya kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The father of these two fought for the full kingdom
 shila dikshit 15 saalon tak purna rajya ke liye ladati raheen or ab vah iskaa virodh kar rahi hai
 13- Let us see what happens after fasting
 log jamaa honge, signechar honge, march honge, dekhte hai ki upwas kahaan par khatm hoga
 BJP had said that give seven mps, they will give full state status
 unhone apana vaada puraa nahin kiya
 Now we are saying that give us seven mps, we will give full statehood
 14- desh ke log dekh chuke hai ki modi-shah kii jodi desh ke liye kitni khatarnaak he
 He lost the country's fleet
 inhone notebandi kii, jiesti kii, ceiling kii
 Brakes were put on the economy
 dedh karod log berozegaar ho gaye
 The worst thing that has been done is to end the brotherhood of the country
 hinduon ko musalamaanon se ladaa diya
 The Jats were fought with non-jats, Marathas with non-marathas, Patel with non-patel
 logon ke man main jehar bharne kaa kaam kiya he
 15- Pakistan has been trying for the last 70 years how to weaken India
 kaise bharat ke logon ko dharm ke naam par baanta jaae, jo kaam karne main pakistan 70 saal main safal nahin hua, vah kaam paanch saal main modi or amit shah ne kar diya
 If modi-shah wins in 16– 2019, they will end the elections by changing the constitution of the country, as Hitler did
 abhi amit shah ne apni ek raily main kaha tha ki agar ve 2019 main jeet gaye to 2050 tak bijepi ko koi nahin haraa saktaa
 They have similar planning
 is samay janatantr or desh ko bachaana jaruri he
 17- At this time in the country, it is necessary that only one candidate should stand against the BJP so that votes are not divided
 pichhali baar bijepi 31 fisadi vot se jiti thi, yani 69 fisadi log uske khilaaf the
 This figure is from when the Modi wave was going on
 18- ham centre sarkaar main nahin aa rahe hai
 i am not making any alliance for power
 ye desh ke liye jaruri he
 The country is helpless, it is necessary to defeat the BJP
 19- modi ji ne kaha tha ki swaminathan kamishan kii report lagu karuunga
 How sad the farmers are today
 aaj desh main kahin bhi mob linching ho rahi he, koi pakadaa nahin jaataa
 If there is no peace or brotherhood in the country, then the country cannot progress
 20- idi or iti kii maas scale par red ho rahi he
 Talk to anyone in the country
 jajon se baat karlo
 Everybody is afraid to talk that the call is being recorded
 21- pulavama atake kaa raajnneetikaran to ho rahaa he
 BJP people are talking about putting BJP flags in the houses of martyrs, is going on in social media
 mere modi ji se matbhed ho sakate hai, lekin agar vah pakistan ke khilaaf sakht ection lete hai to main unka samarthan karuunga
 Pakistan goes through anything
 use isaki keemat pataa honi chahie
 22- Modi government gave two wrong messages
 ek to modi ji navaj sharif se janmdin par bin bulaae, bina shedul ke chale gaye
 Through which Pakistan realized our weakness somewhere
 duusari ore pathankot ke airbase par iesai waalon ne hamalaa kara diya
 We called the same terrorists and asked them to investigate it
 ye kamajori kaa ahsaas dete hai
 International diplomacy runs at par
 wo agar 40 maarthe hai to aap 400 maaro
 Take such action that Pakistan has to pay ten times the price
 phir aisa karne kii nahin sochega
 23- i do not understand the intention of the Congress
 dilli main vah aam aadmi party ko kamjor kar rahi he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP is weakening
 pashchim bengal main vah mamata ji ko kamjor kar rahe hai
 i think votes should not be distributed
 24- hamaare saaton saansad jeet jaaen to ham cabinet main koi jagah nahin lenge
 We will just take the full state status of Delhi
 25- centre sarkaar sibiai, idi, iti kii red rajya sarkaron ko daraane ke liye kar rahi he
 If people do not like state governments then people will replace them

 ilaaj hi ban gaya marzuttar pradesh kii praarambhik shiksha rajnatik daanvpech ke bhi gavaah rahe hai
 This is the hallmark of this education friend
 pradesh main badahaal padi praarambhik shiksha kii gaadi ko patari par laane ke liye 1999 main gramin kshetron main shiksha mitra tainaat karne kii yojana taiyaar kii gai thi
 These Shiksha Mitras were selected through the Village Education Committees headed by the village head
 primary skulon main tainaat hone vaale in shiksha mitron ke sambandh main jari shasnadesh main saaf likhaa gaya ki ise kisi tarah kaa sevaayojan nahin mana jayega
 After the Right to Education Act came into force in 2010, the task of fixing the standard of deployment of teachers came into the hands of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)
 ensitii ne ek adhisuchana jari kar shikshakon kii tainaati ke liye tiiti ko paas karnaa anivaary kar diya
 Till earlier, the common standard of deployment of teachers was BTC training with graduates
 2014 main rajya sarkaar ne kanoon main sanshodhan karke snaatak kii yogyata rakhane vaale shiksha mitron ko primary skulon main sahaayak shikshak ke taur par niyukt karne kaa rasta saaf kar diya

 "the government also removed TET, the minimum qualification for deployment of teachers, through this amendment," says Mishra
 jabaki aisa karne kaa adhikaar keval centre sarkaar kii sanstha ensitii ko he
 "keeping this logic in mind, Allahabad High Court quashed the adjustment made on 12 September 2015 to the post of Assistant Teacher of Shiksha Mitra
 kuch hi din baad supreme court ne hycourt ke faisle par roak laga di thi
 Then this year, the Supreme Court asked that Shiksha Mitras be appointed as teacher posts only after passing the eligibility test twice
 shiksha mitron ke baari virodh-pradarshan ke baad damege control ke liye sarkaar ne 5 paanch sitambar ko cabinet baithak main shiksha mitron ko pehali agast se das hajaar ru
 Decided to pay honorarium
 uttar pradesh praathmik shiksha mitra sangh ne is puure prakaran par supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daayar kii he
 Sangh president Ghazi Imam Ala says, "the court, in its decision, had asked to give age relaxation, weighting in the eligibility test to Shiksha Mitras but the government has not taken any decision on it
" iske alaava rashtriya adhyaaapak shiksha parishad main bhi shikshakon kii paatrata pariksha karaane kaa niyam to he lekin shikshak chayan prakriya kaa koi zikr nahin he
 In such a situation, starting the teacher selection process is beyond the rules
 " haalanki basic shiksha rajyamantri, swatantra prabharee anupama jaiswal kahati hai, ''sarkaar supreme court ke nirnay ke anupaalan main shiksha mitron ko har sambhav riyaayat di ja rahi he
 "here too, the war with friends over education is not limited to Uttar Pradesh alone
 2003 main bihar main bhi shiksha mitron kii bahaali ke baad se lagaataar unka virodh-pradarshan bhi hota rahaa he
 Now once again the teachers and government employed here are on a collision course
 unhone andolan kii chetavanee bhi di he
 These employed teachers also include Shiksha Mitra
 2005 main shiksha mitron ko niojit shikshak bana diya gaya tha
 Actually, on the one hand, while the court verdict in Uttar Pradesh was broken as a bulwark on education friends, it has come as a ray of hope in Bihar
 31 aktubar ko patna hycourt ne apane faisle main sarkaar ko in niojit shikshakon ko ''samaan kaam ke badale samaan vetan" dene kaa aadesh diya he
 Nawada District President of Bihar Transformational Teachers Association, Prabhakar Kumar says, "apart from teaching children from employed teachers, help is taken in a variety of tasks including mid-day meal, juggling, animal census, child registration, BLO, awareness programs, but They are not paid the same salary as older teachers
 " darasal anya puraane shikshakon kaa vetan in niojit shikshakon se kareeb dhai guna zyada he
 But where there is hope among these teachers after the decision of the High Court, on the other hand the state government is in a mood to postpone it
 rajya ke shiksha mantri krishnanandan prasad verma kehete hai, ''ham faisle kaa gambhirthapurvak adhyayan karenge, phir rajya sarkaar kadam uthaaegi
 If necessary, we will appeal against this decision in the Supreme Court
 " sarkaar kii chintaa he ki faisle ko lagu karne se rajya par aarthik boj bad jayega
 But former Patna University professor Naval Kishore Chaudhary rejects the argument, "the budget cannot be used as an excuse for teachers' salaries
" jarurat ho to anya madon main katautee karke shiksha mad main kharch kiya janaa chahie
 "many unions of employed teachers are mobilizing against this strategy of the state government
 12 november ko 23 shikshak sanghon ke netaaon kii baithak hui or samaan vetanman ke andolan ko aage badhaane kaa sankalp liya gaya
 "our demand is Rs 9,300-34,800," says Vanshidhar Brijwasi, Bihar state president of the Transformational Elementary Teachers Association
 vetanman kii he, jo puraane shikshakon ko miltaa he
 For this, movement will be done from the legal battle to the road
 " takaraav kii sthiti yahaan tak he ki rajya sarkaar kii ore se unke paksh main teen maah ke bheetar faisla nahin lene par shikshak sanghon ne agle saal ke shuruaati maheenon main hone vaali board parikshaon ke bahishkaar kii bhi chetavanee di he
 On the other hand, in Rajasthan, on November 6, "student friend" wandered from house to house writing unemployed on white caps
 ve ajmer up-chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko vot na dene kii apil karke apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Actually, like education friends, students are friends in Rajasthan
 pahari rajya uttarakhand main bhi shiksha mitra aisi paristhitiyon se guzarate rahe hai
 Now after receiving the approval of permanent appointment for TET and CTET passed education friends in the state, the Basic Education Directorate has sent a proposal to the Education Secretary
 phir bhi nahin gai badahaliin shikshakon ke sankat ne praarambhik shiksha kii badahaali ko bhi beparda kar diya he
 In fact, they were recruited only to bridge the huge shortage of teachers in the past years, but on one hand they have fallen victim to political tactics and court hammer, yet there is still a large number of teachers
 deshbhar main jahaan praarambhik shiksha main kareeb nau lakh shikshakon ke pad rikt pade hai
 Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are the most deficient (see graphic)
 pichley saal november main sansad main ek sawaal ke jawaab main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay main kendriya rajyamantri upendra kushvaha ne bataaya ki madhya pradesh ke 4,837 praathmik skool aise hai jahaan koi bhi shikshak nahin he
 And the number of such schools has been increasing steadily in the last four years
 isi tarah kuch rajyon main prashikshit shikshakon kii bhi baari kami he
 Even around 45 percent of the posts in teacher training institutes like District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) are vacant across the country
 isi tarah beete varshon main skulon kii buniyadi suvidhaon main sudhaar to hua he lekin kuch rajyon main sthiti ab bhi acchhee nahin he (dekhen graphic)
 According to an estimate by the Education Department, about one thousand primary schools in UP either do not have their own buildings or they are dilapidated
 itnaa hi nahin 46 hajaar skool aise bhi hai jinke paas bijli kaa conection bhi nahin he
 During the last six years, the number of students in primary schools of the state has declined
 basic shiksha vibhaag main ek sanyukt nideshak bataate hai, ''bacchon kii sankhya badhaane ke liye sarkaar mukrat pustaken, uniform, skool bag, juute-mojey to baant rahi he lekin skool kii moolbhoot suvidhaon par koi dhyaan nahin he
 Now parents do not want to teach their children by sitting on the ground
 " lekin basic shiksha rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) anupama jaiswal bataati hai, ''is varsh basic skulon main padhgaye aane vaale chaatro kii sankhya main kam se kam 25 hajaar kaa ijapha hua he
 "the road ahead is different opinions on solutions to the crisis of teachers and primary education
 akhil bharat shiksha adhikaar manch ke adhyaksh mandal ke sadsy or prakhyat shikshavid dow
 Anil Sadgopal says, "the education crisis will remain until the appointing policies on non-equal terms of service are removed
" " kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash javdekar bhi maanate hai ki diployament kii dikkatein rahi hai or sarkaar ne isko lekar rajyon ko nirdesh bhi die hai taaki aisi sthitiyaan khatm ho
 Obviously, this crisis will not end if the right policies are not framed and they are not implemented properly, by closing contracts and non-equal appointments

 In such a situation, they are more tense about failure
 iske chalate yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vah aatmahatya kar len
 This has also come to light in research
 vaise to insaan kaa jajba agar majboot ho vah kya nahin kar saktaa lekin kai baar halaat aise ho jate hai ki vyakti ke paas sabakuch hote hue bhi vah aatmahatya kar le
 This is because usually man wants to win only in his life

 Expectations from Successful People: If that successful person does not meet those expectations, then he can become a victim of criticism and at the same time, that person can develop guilt about himself and he can turn towards suicide

 manch par bolte hue shivaraj chouhan ne kaha ki meri har saans rajya kii janata ke liye he
 Simultaneously, CM Shivraj said that the state cannot move forward without a farmer
 unhone kisaani ko sarkaar kii sabase badi praathamikta bataaya or kaha ki kisaanon ko kheti kaa pani pahunchaana unki sarkaar kaa mukhya lakshya rahaa he
 At the Dussehra ground, the Chief Minister is also meeting the representatives of the farmers

 aaj UNGA main piem modi kaa sambodhanephn modi ke baad imran khan kaa bhaashan2014 main modi ne aatank par kiya tha warasamyukt raashtra mahasabha ko aaj pradhanmantri narendra modi sambodhit karenge
 At 8 pm Indian time, PM Modi will tell the world his vision, this will be the first address of the Prime Minister to the UN after coming to power again
 narendra modi ke thik baad imran khan bhi UNGA ko sambodhit karenge
 In such a situation, a series of blows may appear between the heads of the two countries
 aisa pehali baar nahin he jab sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main bharat-pakistan ke pramukh is tarah aamane-samneate rahe hon
 In the past, this platform has been used by Pakistan to chant the melody of Kashmir and each time India has given it a befitting reply
 isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 27 sitambar 2014 main UNGA ko sambodhit kiya tha, to kai masalon kaa zikr kiya tha
 While the then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, chanted Kashmir with this platform, but Pakistan did not benefit from it
 kya bole the piem narendra modi?sanyukt raashtra main apane pehle sambodhan main piem modi ne duniya ke saamne apana vijan rakhaa tha, tab unhone UN piskiping main bharat ke yogadan, 21veen sadi main bharat ke role, sanyukt raashtra kii bhoomika main badlaav kaa zikr kiya tha
 At the same time, on the issue of Pakistan, PM Modi said that India is ready to talk to the neighboring country, but for that Pakistan will have to leave terrorism first
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki ‘good terarysm-bed terarysm’ jaisi koi chiz nahin hoti he
 At the time there was a flood in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), Prime Minister Modi had also mentioned in his address that India had offered help to Pakistan but had not accepted
 bataa den ki isi bhaashan ke dauraan pradhanmantri modi ne ‘antarrashtriya yoga diwas’ kaa prastaav rakhaa tha, jise sanyukt raashtra main turant sweekaara gaya or 180 se adhik deshon ne bharat ke prastaav kaa samarthan kiya tha
 What did Nawaz Sharif say? Nawaz Sharif, the then Pakistani Prime Minister, had said at that time that he had also visited India to make good relations with India
 lekin antarrashtriya samudaay ko jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa hal karwaane main madad kerani chahie, iske liye kashmir ke sabhi pakshon jisamen hurriyat ke log bhi shaamil hai unase bhi baat honi chahie

 Bareilly's Barfi and Luka Chupi fame actress Kriti Sanon have started a debate in Bollywood over the credit for the success of the films
 credit ke alaava gender ke aadhaar par fees bhi manoranjan jagat ke liye bada sawaal he
 This is seen in the case of female actors who do not come from the powerful background, credit is given to the male actors after the film hits
 jabaki kuch actraces ko chhod diya jaae to zyaadaatar femail actors ko apane mail actors ke mukaable behad kam fees milti he
 After the success of Luka Chuppi, released last month, Kriti Sanon raised questions about this trend in Bollywood
 darasal, kriti luka chuphi main karthik aryan ke baraabar credit naa milane se naaraaz dikhin
 He said, "when both Mel and the female actress are running a film together, why give all the credits to the Mail star?" The question of the work is completely legitimate
 kriti ne apane ab tak ke chote kariyar main kai behtareen filmein kii hai
 Talking about hide and seek, Kriti is no less than Kartik Aryan or other actors in any case
 film main unke kirdaar kaa spes bhi najar aata he
 Karti is not weaker in acting and performance than Karthik
 phir aakhir kriti ko credit na die jane kii vajah kya he? jabaki kriti senon ne dilavaale, heropanti, bareli kii barfi jaisi hit filmein di hai
 Is it because of being an out cider female star in Bollywood? If it is not the case, despite the strong work, a heroine like Kriti is not being praised in the way she deserves
 darasal, mahaj do filmein karne vaali sara ali khan yaa mahaj ek film karne vaali jahnavi kapur ko dekhen to unki tarifon ke pul najar aate hai
 Almost all the 'elite Critics' took both the films and work in hand and called them the stars of the future
 jabaki simba main to sara ke liye ek actress ke taur par karne ke liye kuch bhi nahin tha
 But he too was given credit with Ranveer Singh
 kangana ek lambey vakt se bollywood main bhai bhatijawad or ek duusare ko pramot karne kaa aarope lagaati rahati hai
 Many female actors have raised questions about the fees
 yahaan tak khabaren ain ki deepika padukon ne kam fees kii vajah se film tak chhod di thi
 Sonam Kapoor has also expressed surprise at the discrimination being faced by actresses in the industry
 kriti ne bollywood main gender ke hisaab se milane vaali selary par bhi baat kii
 He said "I believe that salary should be in sync with two things
" pehla film main aapaki bhoomika or doosraa darshakon ko theatre tak khinch laane kii kshamta
 "now that even a female actor is carrying a film on her shoulder, it is legitimate to give her credit
 kriti senon ke sawaal ko galat nahin tehraaya ja saktaa

 The Bharatiya Janata Party may not have fielded Muslim candidates in the Lok Sabha and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, but has surprised everyone by giving tickets to Muslims in the civic body elections
 pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu se lekar narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main kai muslim ummidavaaron ko bijepi ne tikat diya he
 It is being said that Kiyogi Adityanath has been Modi's Gujarat model in this matter and he has spoiled the game of the parties Congress, SP and BSP, who have backed the political ideology with this bet
 narendra modi jab gujarat kii satta par kabiz hue to 2007 ke nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi ne saikadon muslim ummidavaaron ko maidan main utaara, jinamein se 200 se zyada parshad jeetne main safal rahe
 Apart from this, in the 2012 Municipal Body Election, nearly 200 councilors on BJP ticket were successful in winning
 inamen se kai ko bijepi ne chairman bhi banaaya
 This model of Gujarat is now being adopted by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in UP
 upi ke jin jilon main muslimon kii aabaadi 30 fisadi se upar he, vahaan bijepi ne is nagar nikaay chunaav main muslim chehron par bhi daanv lagaaya he
 The BJP has nominated Abbul Ghafur Khan of Unnao's Kuramath Nagar Panchayat, Ayesha Khan from Shahjahanpur Nagar Panchayat of Meerut and Nisha Parveen from Sarspur Nagar Panchayat of Bijnor
 kasganj kii bhargan nagar panchayat se najma begum adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladengi
 BJP spokesperson Chandramohan says that those who accuse Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of communalism should look into their community
 hamaari sarkaar sabakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas kaa mantra lekar chal rahi he, jisamen koi tabaka peeche nahin chhutegaa
 The BJP had raised the votes of Muslim women in the recent assembly elections by raising the issue of triple talaq
 usne nagar nikaay chunaav main muslim mahilaon par hi zyada daanv lagaaya he
 BJP candidate Shaheen Bano of ward number two of Unchahar Nagar Panchayat in Rae Bareli district says that the BJP has taken a commendable step by giving tickets to Muslim candidates
 isse muslim samaaj or bhi teji se bijepi ke saath judega
 Aligarh Muslim University Professor Mo
 sajaad kehete hai- bijepi upi ke nagar nikaay chunaav main muslimon ko tikat dene ke peeche bahuuddeshyi kaaran he
 The BJP is going through a crisis of mass base and popularity, as the government has so far failed in its promises
 aise main party apane ko nae rup se sthapit karne ke liye vistaar karnaa chaahati hogi, isiilie muslimon ko tikat diya gaya he
 All parties give tickets by looking at the winning candidate
 upi ke nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi ko muslim ummidavaar jitau najar aa rahe honge, isi vajah se tikat diya he
 There is also a purpose behind this that all society has a stake in the party
 sajaad kehete hai ki pashchimi upi kii kai aise nagar nikaay site hai, jahaan sirf muslim hi jeet saktaa he
 In such a situation, BJP may also aim to make its presence felt
 iske alaava pashchim main muslimon ke paas chunaav ladane ke liye sakasham he
 BJP had fielded Muslim candidates in the civic body for the last few elections in Gujarat as well and won but Juhapura today cries over its powerlessness
 aise main upi main muslim bijepi se jitkar kya badalenge
 Former MP Ilyas Azmi says that there is no meaning in giving tickets to the municipal elections
 ye sirf dikhaava or khanpurti he
 In fact, where the BJP should give tickets, it does not give tickets to the Muslims, where they go after winning and show their participation in the policy of the country
 unhone kaha ki nagar nikaay chunaav main muslim ummidavaar apane dam par jeetne kii kuvat rakhte hai
 In the last election, around 300 Muslims have been successful in winning in the municipal body
 aise main bijepi ne unhen tikat dekar apni koi aihasaan nahin kiya he

 He explained how the situation was and why this step was taken
 unhone kaha ki pichley maheene patharbaji se bachane ke liye ek shaks ko jeep main baandhakar maanav kavach ke taur par istemaal karne ke unke kadam se kai logon kii jaan batch pai
 Major Gogoi defended his move
 bhartiya sena main kisi major rank ke adhikari kaa media ke saamne aakar is tarah apana paksh rakhane kaa vakya kabhi-kabhaar hi hota he
 Hardly before this, an army major is making a statement on an incident like this
 is puure maamle main bharat sarkaar ne bhi major gogoi kaa bachaav kiya he or unka samarthan bhi kiya

 Gogoi, appearing in front of the media, said that on April 9, a small group of security personnel were surrounded by around 1200 stone-pelters at a polling station in Utligam in Budgam district and at least 12 would have been killed if they had ordered firing

 He said that women and children were also involved in the mob and were threatening to set the polling booth on fire
 gogoi ne kaha ki bheed ke bich unhone ek aise shaks ko dekha jo 'aguva' jaisaa lag rahaa tha, kyonki vah utaligam main patharbaajon ko 'uksaa' rahaa tha
 The military officer said that the idea of tying a man named Farooq Ahmed Dar with the bonnet of a jeep suddenly flashed in his mind so that polling personnel and paramilitary personnel could be safely evacuated and no one was harmed
 
 unhone kaha ki daar ko jeep se baandhe jane ke baad kuch der ke liye patharbaji tham gai or isse matdaan karmiyon or ardhsainik bal ke javaanon ko surakshit nikalne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Gogoi, while giving detailed information about the incident while speaking to reporters at his Birwah camp in Budgam district, said, "I only did this for the sake of saving the local people
" yadi maine goli chalaai hoti to 12 se zyada jaane jaati

" ’’ baharhaal, daar isse khush nahin hai
 About the investigation, he said, "it is a complete fraud
 ’’ daar ne kaha, ‘‘ve kabhi gambhir nahin the

 Major, however, claimed in front of the media that Dar was caught by the soldiers while throwing stones
 is bich, vaishvik maanavadhikaar sanghathan emnesti international ne gogoi ko sammanit karne ke thalsena ke faisle kii aalochana kii
 Now Major Leetul Gogoi of the Indian Army surrounded in this controversy has now appeared in the media
 unhone us din kii ghatana kaa byora sabhi ke saamne rakhaa
 He explained how the situation was and why this step was taken
 unhone kaha ki pichley maheene patharbaji se bachane ke liye ek shaks ko jeep main baandhakar maanav kavach ke taur par istemaal karne ke unke kadam se kai logon kii jaan batch pai
 Major Gogoi defended his move
 bhartiya sena main kisi major rank ke adhikari kaa media ke saamne aakar is tarah apana paksh rakhane kaa vakya kabhi-kabhaar hi hota he
 Hardly before this, an army major is making a statement on an incident like this
 is puure maamle main bharat sarkaar ne bhi major gogoi kaa bachaav kiya he or unka samarthan bhi kiya
 Union Minister m Venkaiah Naidu said that he saved the lives of many people under "exceptional circumstances"
 apni karrwai par kai logon ke uthte sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye major gogoi ko sena ne is baat kii ijaajat kii vah sabhi ko jawaab den
 Gogoi, appearing in front of the media, said that on April 9, a small group of security personnel were surrounded by around 1200 stone-pelters at a polling station in Utligam in Budgam district and at least 12 would have been killed if they had ordered firing
 somvaarko thalsena adhyaksh kii ore se sammanit kiye gaye gogoi ne kaha ki bharat-tibet seemaa police (itibipi) ke kuch javaanon or kuch matdaan karmiyon ko jab kareeb 1200 patharbaajon ne gher liya or ‘sankat main hone kii soochna’ di to vah or 5 anya thalsainik us matdaan centre par gaye the
 He said that women and children were also involved in the mob and were threatening to set the polling booth on fire
 gogoi ne kaha ki bheed ke bich unhone ek aise shaks ko dekha jo 'aguva' jaisaa lag rahaa tha, kyonki vah utaligam main patharbaajon ko 'uksaa' rahaa tha
 The military officer said that the idea of tying a man named Farooq Ahmed Dar with the bonnet of a jeep suddenly flashed in his mind so that polling personnel and paramilitary personnel could be safely evacuated and no one was harmed
 
 unhone kaha ki daar ko jeep se baandhe jane ke baad kuch der ke liye patharbaji tham gai or isse matdaan karmiyon or ardhsainik bal ke javaanon ko surakshit nikalne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Gogoi, while giving detailed information about the incident while speaking to reporters at his Birwah camp in Budgam district, said, "I only did this for the sake of saving the local people
" yadi maine goli chalaai hoti to 12 se zyada jaane jaati

 Amitabh Bachchan had said in an interview that Sippy waited for 20 days to film a scene
 iske 26 ritek hue the
 This scene was when Jaya Bachchan comes to light the lantern
 ise khaas roshni main shoot karnaa tha, jo ki mil nahin rahi thi
 8
 sholay main suurama bhopali kaa kirdaar jagadeep jaafaree ne nibhaayaa tha jise aaj bhi sab yaad karte he or suurama bhopali ke naam se hi pahachaanate hai
 Actually, it was a real character
 suurama bhopal kaa rahane vaala ek forest adhikari tha, jise javed akhtar kareeb se jaanate the

 amitabh bachchan, jaya, sanjeev kumaar, hema malini starer film ne box offis par karodon kii kamai kii thi
 Some have even called it the highest-grossing film in the history of India
 10
 Shekhar Kapur praised Sholay saying, "the Hindi film industry can be divided into two parts
 pehla hissaa 'sholay' kii release ke pehle kaa or doosraa hissaa release ke baad kaa
 "emergency: Movies used to be seen before release, Jalwa diya print 11
 puri film kii shooting karnataka ke bengaluru or mysore ke bich sthit pahadiyon se ghire 'ramnagaram' main hui thi
 'ramanagaram' of the south was given the appearance of Ramgarh, a village in northern India suffering from the terror of dacoits
 yahaan lagbhag do saal se zyada film kii shooting hui
 12
 nirmaataaon ne ramgarh ke rup main ek puure gaanv ko basaaya
 Built a paved road to reach the village
 vaise ye gaanv sholay se pehle bhi tha, lekin sholay ke baad hi logon ke bich is gaanv kii pahchaan hui
 In later years it also became a center of tourist attraction
 jab film kii shooting khatm hui logon ne ramnagaram ke ek hisse ko 'sippi nagar' kaa naam dekar nirmaataaon kaa aabhaar jataayaa
 13
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabik jab sholay film kii shooting khatm hui tab production team ne gaanv ujaad diya
 While returning to Mumbai, GP Sippy wanted to sell the valuable material purchased to settle Ramgarh village to local Seth PV Nagarajan for one lakh rupees
 lekin baat nahin ban pai
 Eventually all the material used in the construction of the village was distributed
 kuch saamaan nilaam kar diya gaya
 And much of the stuff was given to the laborers working with the film unit
 14
 When Sholay was released in 1975, it did not receive a very good response
 samikshakon ne bhi film ko lekar bahut kharaab rivyuu die
 15
 ramesh sippi ke sholay kii script manjuur karne se pehle ise kai filmkaar riject kar chuke the
 Earlier salim-javed created its 4 line snippet
 16
 It was only after Sholay that the script writers started getting good fees and respect in Bollywood
 17
 Sholay was engaged in at least 100 theaters across the country for 25 weeks
 yah apane aap main ek record he
 18
 film ke dialog "kitne aadmi the" ko parfect banane ke liye diarector ne 40 ritek liye the
 19
 thakur kaa kirdaar pehle ritair army afasar kaa tha, lekin parmishan main mushkil se bachane ke liye ise ritair police afasar kaa kiya gaya

 sholay ko 2005 main pichley 50 saal kii best film ghoshit kiya gaya tha

 They help people sit far away and communicate with each other, take advantage of facilities like trade and commerce and provide better availability of healthcare and education

 Arundhati Roy's writing is not an isolated introduction
 angreji ke apane pehle upanyaas 'da god of small things' ke liye na keval unhone bukar puraskaar jeeta, balki anuwaad kii marfat duniya bhar ke sahitya par apana prabhaav choda
 His book appeared in Hindi under the name 'god of minor things'
 arundhati ne ek vaastukar ke rup main prashikshan praapt kiya, par apni chhap ek lekhak, maanavvid andolankaaree ke rup main hi chodi
 It is said that he wrote screenplays for two films and acted in two films as well as a production designer
 unki duusari kitabon main 'algebra of inphenite justise' or 'en ordinary persons guide tu empire' shaamil he
 His latest novel 'the Ministry of Almost Happiness' was published in Hindi and 'ur Khushi Ka Gharana' in Hindi and Urdu under the name 'bepnah Shadmani Ki Mamlikat'
 is kitaab ke locarpan ke maukey par khud arundhati ne kaha tha, "haalanki meri yah pustak ab tak desh-videsh kii 49 bhashaaon main anudit ho chuki he
 Nevertheless, it was completed for me only after coming to Hindi and Urdu
 
 
 vaise bhi 'da ministry of atmost happines' ko likhane main bahut samay laga
 Writing it was like solving a puzzle for me
 vaaki 'apaar kushi kaa gharaana' hamen kai varshon kii yatra par le jaataa he
 Introducing this book, publisher Rajkamal Prakashan has written something like this on his website and Amazon: It is a story that unfolds from the tumultuous settlements of years old Delhi to the flourishing new metropolis and the plains of Kashmir and the jungles of Central India
 Goes, where war is peace and peace is war, and where the situation is declared to be normal
 anjum, jo pehle aafatab thi, shahar ke ek qabristaan main apana taar-taar kaaleen bichaati he or use apana ghar kahati he
 One midnight, a baby girl suddenly appears in the litter carousel on the pavement
 rahasmay es
 Tilottama remains as absent as he is present in the lives of the three men who love him
 'apaar kushi kaa gharaana' ek saath dukhati hui prem-katha or asandigdh pratirodh kii abhivyakti he
 He has been spoken of in whispers, in screams, through tears and sometimes with laughter
 uske nayak ve log hai jinhen us duniya ne tod daalaa he jisamen ve rahete hai or phir prem or ummid ke bal par bache hue rahete hai
 For this reason, she is as brittle as she is, and she never surrenders
 yah sammohak, shandaar kitaab nae andaaz main phir se bataati he ki ek upanyaas kya kar saktaa he or kya ho saktaa he
 The charisma of the story-art of Arundhati Roy is recorded on every page of it
 sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye arundhati roy ke charchit upanyaas 'da ministry of atmost happines' ke hindi anuwaad 'apaar kushi kaa gharaana' kaa ek ansh xxrep 4 * neeche futapaath par, jantar-mantar ke kinare, jahaan hamaari bacchee avatarit hui, subah ke samay bhi kaafii bheed-bhaad thi
 Communists, traitors, separatists, revolutionaries, dreamers, lazy, headstrong, drug addicts, freelancers and knowledgeable people of all kinds hovered around who could not bring any gift for the newborn
 pichley das dinon se shahar main ek nayaa tamaasha khadaa hone ke kaaran ve sab kinare kar die gaye the or vahaan se hataa die gaye the jo kabhi unka apana ilaaka tha
 - This was the only place in the city where they were allowed to gather
 bees se bhi zyaada tivi timen pile rang kii crenon par apane camere jamaaye hue choubison ghante us nae chamakdaar sitare kii chaukasee ke liye jamaa thim: ve ek budhu, gol-matol gandhivaadi, gramin-saamaajik-kaaryakarta-bane-bhootpurv-sainik the, jinhone bhrashtachar-mukt bharat ke swapn ko saakaar karne ke liye aamaran anshan kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 He was lying on his back like a sick saint and had a picture of Bharatmata behind him
 - bharat kii maanchitr-numa akruti ke bheetar kai banhon vaali devi (beshak, avibhajit bharat, jisamen pakistan or bangladesh bhi dikhaae gaye the)
 His whispers, his whispering instructions to people gathered around him, were broadcast live day and night
 budhu ne hawa kaa rukh pahchaan liya tha
 This season of reconnaissance of the city was also a season of scams - coal scam, cast iron scam, housing scam, insurance scam, stamp paper scam, phone license scam, land scam, dam scam, irrigation scam, arms and ammunition scam, petrol Pump scam, polio vaccine scam, electricity bill scam, text-book scam, sage-saint scam, famine relief scam, car number scam, voter list scam, identity card And Gotala- and them all politicians, business leaders and politicians-businessmen was unimaginable looting of public funds
 budhu ne ek achche khazaane ke khoji kii tarah ek ucch koti ke ghotaale ko pakadaa tha, jise lekar logon main bahut gussa tha, or isse ve raaton-raat aise maseehaa ban gaye jisaki ummid khud unhen bhi nahin thi
 His dream of a corruption-free society was a happy pasture where everyone - no matter how corrupt - was allowed to graze for a while
 ve tamaam log, jinka aapas main koi lenaa-dena nahin tha (vampanthi, dakshinpanthi, panthviheen), sab unki taraf umadane lage
 As his sudden incarnation from an unknown began to inspire and give a purpose to the new and restless generation, which till now was unaware of history and politics
 genes or tii-shart pahane hue yuva guitar or bhrashtachar virdohi swarchit geeton ke saath aate the
 They would also bring with them flags and placards on which Enough is Enough! And would have written End Corruption Now
 is parighatna ke prabandhan ke liye peshewar naujavaanon kii ek team -vakil, acountint or computer programmer- gathit kii gai
 They raised money, big tents and lots of frills which included items like Bharatmata's picture, national flag supplies, Gandhi caps, banners, digital media campaigns
 budhu ke dehati bhaashan or udbodhan twitor par koob chale or fesabook par chaa gaye
 The hunger of TV cameras, however, was not dissolving
 avkaash-praapt naukarshah, police or faujee adhikari bhi isamen shaamil ho gaye
 The crowd kept growing
 budhu is turanta staradam se prasann ho uthe
 This made them slightly bloated and slightly aggressive
 unhen laga ki mahaz bhrashtachar ke mudde tak simit rahane se unki style avaruddh ho rahi he or lokapriyata gir rahi he
 He thought that he could do so much that the fans should give him a little bit of his original nature, his true essence and the innate pastoral wisdom
 or is tarah ek sarkas shuru hua
 They announced that they had launched India's second freedom struggle
 apane vruddh-bal-swar main unke jhakzorne vaale bhaashan aise lagate the jaise do gubbaare aapas main ragad kha rahe hon
 But they seemed to touch the soul of the country
 bacchon kii janmdin party ke jaadugar kii tarah ve kai kartab dikhalaate or palak jhapakate hi ek uphaar nikaal le aate
 They had something for everyone
 unhone puraane or vivaadaaspad yudhghosh 'vande maataram!’ ke zariye hindu kattartavaadiyon (jo bharatmata ke nakshe ko dekhakar pehle hi kush the) main urja kaa sanchaar kar diya
 When some Muslims were harassed on this, their committee called a Muslim film actor from Bombay wearing a namazi cap (which he usually did not wear) as a symbol of unity in diversity, more than an hour on stage with old age Remained seated paramparawaadiyon ko rijhaane ke liye budhu gandhiji ko uddhrut karte the
 They used to say that India is liberated only in the caste system
 'har jati ko vah kaam karnaa chahie jiske liye uskaa janm hua he, lekin har kaam kaa sammaan hona zaruri he
 'when the Dalits were enraged by this, a small girl from a municipal cleaner was brought in by wearing a new frock and placed side by side
 uske haath main pani kii bottle thi, jisase budhu bich-bich main pani pite rahe
 The old slogan for the radical moralists was to cut off the hands of the poor
 aatankwaadiyon ko phaansi chadha dena chahie
 In support of nationalists of all colors, he thundered: 'if you ask for milk, you will give kheer, if you ask for Kashmir, you will rip off'! She was found living a life of simplicity and celibacy in her room adjoining the temple
 ve yah kahana nahin bhoolatey the ki gandhiji kii brahmacharya-sadhana se unhen upwas kii takat milti he
 For proof, he got up from his bed on the third day of fasting and ran on the stage in a white dhoti-kurta and also performed soft fishes of the arms
 log kushi se lahalot the or apane bacchon ko bhi unka aashirwad dilaane laate the
 Television viewership skyrocketed
 vigyapanon kii baadh aa gai
 Such a frenzy had not been seen in at least the last twenty years since the news of drinking milk of idols of Lord Ganesha together in temples all over the world on one such miraculous day
 lekin ab yah budhu ke upwas kaa nauvaan din tha or apane bheetar sanchit tamaam veery-kosh ke baavjood ve duble dikhne lage the
 Later that day, there was a rumor in the city of increasing amounts of cratinin and weakening of the kidneys
 unke bistar ke aasapaas diggajon kii bheed lag gai
 They photographed him with his hands in their hands and (although no one feared it) requested him to survive
 ghotaalon main jin udyogpatiyon ke naam the, unhone unke abhiyaan ko chanda diya or ahimsa ke prati budhu kii adig aasthaa ke gun gaae (haath kaatane, phaansi dene or ang-bhang ke unke nuskhon ko vaazib chetavanee hi mana gaya)
 a relatively old-fashioned admirer of old age who had the material comforts of life, he had never felt the tide of adrenalin within himself, which rises as a proud anger when he joins a mass movement 
 ve kaaron or motorcykilon par rashtriya dhvaj laharaate or deshbhakti ke geet gaate hue aate
 The Messiah of India's economic charism, the government of the Pinjambed rabbit, was paralyzed
 dur gujarat main gujarat ke lallaa ko budhu balak ke avataran main ek daivi sanket nazar aayaa
 He started speeding up his Delhi journey with an unmistakable ease like a hunter
 budhu ke upwas ke paanchaven din lallaa ne (pratik-rup main kahen to) shahar ke pravesh-dwaar par morchabandi kar lee thi
 His fiery Jannisars dominated Jantar Mantar
 unhone zordaar samarthan dekar budhu ko abhibhoot kar diya
 Their flags were larger than others and the lyrics were louder
 unhone vahaan counter khole or garibon main muft khaanaa baanta (unke paas lallaa ke samarthak lakhpati baabaaon kaa diya hua bharpoor paisa tha)
 He was instructed that he would not wear a saffron bandage on his forehead, would not wave saffron flags and would not forget the name of the heart-emperor of Gujarat
 yah kargar sabit hua
 In a few days, he overthrown
 jin peshewar naujavaanon ne budhu ko shoharat dilaane main kadi mehnat kii thi, unhen is tarah chalata kar diya gaya ki ve - yahan tak ki budhu bhi- samaj nahin paae ki yah kya ho gaya
 That happy pasture was destroyed and no one came to know
 ab pinjre ke khargosh kii shamat aane ko thi
 Soon the Hindu heart-emperor was to climb Delhi
 unke chehre jaise mukhute lagaae hue log kandhon par bithakar laane or unke naam kaa jaap karne vaale the- lallaa, lallaa, lallaa- or unhen gaddi par bithaane vaale the
 Wherever they looked, they would find themselves there
 hindustan ke nae shahenshaah
 They were a sea
 ananthata the
 It was humanity itself
 lekin yah sab abhi ek saal baad hona tha
 At the moment, his supporters were shouting at Jantar Mantar against government corruption (murdabad, Murdabad!)
 raat ko ve ghar jaakar tivi par apni tasviren dekhte
 By the next morning, when he did not return, the 'core group' of Budha and some of his supporters appeared deserted under the huge waving tent where thousands of people could contain him
 bhrashtachar-virdohi mandap kii bagal main puraane imali ke ped kii chhitari hui shakhaon ke neeche ek tayshuda jagah par ek duusari jaani-maani gandhivaadi kaaryakarta hazaron kisaanon or adivaasiyon kii ore se aamaran anshan par baithi thim
 The government had taken away their lands and was going to give them to a petrochemical corporation for setting up a bonded coal mine and thermal power plant in Bengal
 haalaanki ve sundar dikhti huin lambey aakarshak baalo vaali mahila thim, lekin tivi waalon ko budhu ke muqaabale bahut kam pasand thim
 The reason for this was not mysterious
 zyaadaatar television channelon kaa maalik petrochemical corporation hi tha or vah duusare channelon ko bhi bharpoor vigyaapan detaa tha
 That is why the angry analyst came to the TV studio as a guest and condemned him and said that he got money from a 'foreign force'
 ye vishleshak or patrkaar bhi acchhee-kaasi taadaad main corporation ke pe-role par the or apane maalikon kii seva main koi kasar nahin chhodte the
 But the people on the sidewalk loved the woman leader
 khichdi dadhi vaale kisaan unke chehre se machhar bhagaate
 Hatti-katti peasant women massage their feet and look at them with love

 kendriya mantri uma bharti ne kaha he ki ayodhya main mandir nirmaan hone se koi nahin roak saktaa he
 This statement of Uma Bharti came after the statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 bataa den ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne kaha tha ki mandir ke liye sarkaar adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar naa karen, sansad main kanoon laaen or ayodhya main ram kaa mandir banavaaen
 At the same time, Yogi Adityanath while talking to Aaj Tak had said that he is going to Ayodhya on the occasion of Diwali
 uma bharti ne kaha ki ram mandir ko lekar jo maahaul bana he vah isliye bana he kyonki uttar pradesh menyogi adityanathki sarkaar he or centre mennarendra modiki sarkaar he
 Both UP and the Center have a majority government
 uma bharti ne aage kaha ki duniya kii koi bhi takat ram mandir banane se nahin roak saktaa he
 Ram temple will be built only where the land of the temple is

 These governments are the reason why the devotees of Ramlala have fought

 She said that she wants to work for Ganga

 Uma Bharti has appealed to Congress President Rahul Gandhi to get the foundation stone done by accompanying him to Ayodhya
 ram mandir nirmaan ke liye unke jo puraane paap hai vah sab dhul jaaenge
 Uma Bharti said that in 2019 also BJP government will be formed

 yah cheez he congress ke kshatrapon kii toli kaa ek ke baad ek koi dedh darjan chunavi reliyon main ek saath ek manch par baithna
 This time the Congress has come out to challenge BJP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan with an open strategy of this internal 'united Front'
 is nai naveli ekajutata kaa asar janamanas par bhi dikhaa or 30 sitambar kii jabalpur raily or road sho main umadi bheed ne khud congress netaaon ko hairat main daal diya

 main or sabhi pramukh congressi netaa milakar ab tak 18 se 20 raily kar chuke hai or har jagah se hamen raajnneeti ke karavat badalane ke asaar dikhaai de rahe hai
 "jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Energy Minister and President of State Congress Election Committee, who returned to Delhi after a busy election tour, said this in a conversation with India Today
 pradesh congress mahasachiv digvijay singh, rashtriya mahasachiv or madhya pradesh ke prabharee mohan prakaash, congress adhyaksh kantilal bhuriya, kendriya mantri kamalnath, madhya pradesh vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh, varisht netaa suresh pachori jaise diggajon ke bich maasoom chehre or majboot iraade vaale sindhiya ko unke samarthak bhavi mukhyamantri ke taur par dekh rahe hai
 But when asked how Jyotiraditya, the representative of a family with centuries of political experience, how the election campaign is going on under the leadership of AAP, the Guna MP wearing cotton kurta-pajamas, trying to convert the image of his Maharaj into the image of the common man, said , '' i do not lead
 ham congress ke sabhi saat-aath mukhiya ek saath milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 "they are cautious and know that this is the Congress, caution and accident happened here
" darasal chunauti bahut kathin he or safalataa mili to mukhyamantri pad kii res bhi kisi ke liye aasaan nahin hogi
 On this, Kamal Nath says, "I am not in the race for the post of Chief Minister, but if told, i will not refuse to become the Chief Minister
 ” congress netaaon ko ek manch par laane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke kaaran sabhi chunavi samitiyon ke cordinator banaae gaye kamalnath phoonk-phoonk par kadam aage badha rahe hai
 His caution is not wrong, if you look at the figures of the last two assembly elections, the Congress stands in terms of vote percentage, where Digvijay Singh left him
 2003 main party ko jahaan 31
 At 7 per cent of the votes, there was only one per cent increase in 2008 with 32 votes
 8 fisadi ho gaye
 However, in the meantime, Congress seats increased from 38 to 71
 congress ke vot nahin bade lekin bijepi ke vot ghate jarur
 In 2003 BJP had 42
 5 fisadi vot or 173 siten thim, 2008 main yah aankada ghatakar 38
 9 percent votes and 143 seats
 yani bijepi ko maamuli nuksaan hua
 But this loss was not made by the Congress, but by bjp's veteran leader Uma Bharti's then party Bharatiya Janashakti Party 5
 4 fisadi voton ne pahunchaaya tha
 Now Uma and her party are part of the BJP, that is, the figures are with the BJP
 phir bhi congress main utsaah he
 Surrounded by hordes of ticket holders at his Delhi bungalow, Kamal Nath told India Today, "this government has spread corruption from village to village
 log ise ukhaad phenkane par amada hai
 Kamal Nath admitted that four months ago, he too had no idea that the Congress could be formed in this way
 vahiin chunavi taiyaariyon ke pramukh ranneetikaar mohan prakaash kehete hai, ''pradesh main janata vikalp talash rahi he or congress main apana bhavishya dekh rahi he
 "on the other hand, Bhuria is talking about winning the party elections under collective leadership
 vaise sindhiya kaa cheharaa saamne karne se pehle tak bhuriya kaa daawa majboot tha
 He is a tribal leader and took over the reins of the party at a time when almost all senior leaders refused to take up this responsibility
 party ne unke maan ko rakhte hue unhen bhi tikat nirdhaaran cameti kaa adhyaksh bana diya he
 That is, the lamp of hope is kept burning in every heart
 darasal congress jaanati he ki madhya pradesh main yah uske liye 'karo yaa maro’ kii jang he
 a senior party leader said, "from Scindia to Digvijay Singh, i explained to everyone that everyone should come together or else they will drown
" ” netaa kaa daawa he ki kareeb do maheene tak unke awaas par der raat is kad ke netaaon kii baithkon kaa daur chalata rahaa
 The stern attitude of the party high command and the fight to save existence finally forced everyone to drink water at a ghat
 ekta bani rahe, isliye congress ne chunaav prabandhan samiti kaa aakaar to bada rakhaa hi, saath hi takreeban har kshetra or jati tathaa saamaajik samooh ke kshatrap ko tikat vitaran main bhi bhoomika di he
 The party's policy on ticket distribution is being described as strict this time
 tikat ke liye panel system ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 Scindia said, "now the satraps have been asked to hand over one name to the party and should also guarantee its own victory
 bich kaa koi rasta nahin he
 "the party will not give tickets to leaders who have lost elections thrice in life, lost two consecutive assembly elections or lost the last election by more than 15,000 votes
 jo netaa pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav 1,000 se kam voton se haare the, unka tikat pakkaa he
 There are currently seven such leaders in Madhya Pradesh
 iske alaava party tikat vitaran main yuvaaon kii hissedari badhaane kaa bhi daawa kar rahi he
 That is, the attitude of the party is aggressive
 darasal party is theory par chal rahi he ki 2003 main congress kii satta se vidaai ke baad se votaron kii ek nai khep taiyaar hui he
 This 18 to 28 year old voter has only voted during the tenure of BJP governments
 aise main is voter ke liye congress ek nai party he or is voter ko jo bhi asantosh hoga vah bijepi ke hi khilaaf hoga
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan reacts coldly to this entire strategy, "it is the party's job to make a strategy
" chunaav jitaana yaa haraana janata ke haath main he
 With the development work done by our government, BJP will become stronger and form government for the third consecutive time
 ”agar congress kii puri mandali pichley do maheene se reliyaan kar rahi he to chouhan to apane puure kaarykaal main hi gaanv-gaanv ghoomte rahe hai
 Congress's Khavenahar is also convinced of Chauhan's hard work in mutual talks
 chouhan kii 'jan aashirwad’ yatra ko bhi janata kaa acha samarthan mila he
 Anyway, in India Today's 'desh ka Mijaaz' survey (august 28, 2013), 57 percent of the people said that Shivraj was the first choice, while 24 percent people had Scindia as their first choice
 aise main mahinebhar main hawa kaa rukh badalanaa kya aasaan hoga? khaskar tab, jab bijepi ne narendra modi ko apana sirmaur bana liya ho or kshitij par bhagava badal dikhne lage hon
 Shivraj himself has remained strong and popular if sporadic allegations are dropped
 aise main sirf congress kii ekta se kaam nahin chalegaa, balki use koi rambaan chhodia hoga
 Now let the Congress know whether it has such an arrow or not
 bhutan ke log badhai sanket ke rup main taaliyaan nahin bajaate

 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has clarified the statement that the leadership should take responsibility for the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in three states of the Hindi belt
 nitin gadakari ne kaha he ki unke bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala gaya kyonki unhone yah bayaan banking sector ke liye diya tha or raajnneeti par unhone koi tippanee nahin kii thi
 He had said that many are entitled to victory but no one wants to accept failure
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne apane bayaan par safai dete hue kaha he ki pune main ek bank se sambandhit kaarykram main baat karte vakt unhone kehane kii koshish kii ki bank agar munaafe main aata he to bank kii leadership credit leti he
 In the same way, if the bank or business goes into a loss then the responsibility of the bank should also be taken
 isi tarah se maine kaha tha ki agar raajnneeti main chunaav jeetne kaa shrey liya jaataa he to paraajay kaa shrey bhi lenaa chahie
 My statement was distorted and presented
 iskaa raajnneetik paristhiti yaa haal hi main hue vidhansabha chunaaon kaa koi sambandh nahin tha
 He said that BJP will contest elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and i believe that under his leadership, he will get absolute majority

 Because people are vying to take credit for success, but no one wants to accept failure, everyone starts pointing fingers at the other
 darasal sahakaari bank karmiyon ko sambodhit karte hue nitin gadakari udhaaharan de rahe the ki raajnneeti main loksabhaa or vidhansabha main mili haar ke baad ummidavaar bahaanaa banaate hai ki unhen paryaapt sansaadhan nahin mila
 a meeting of big leaders was sought, but that too was canceled, due to which they were defeated
 gadakari ne kaha tha ki unhone aise netaaon se kaha ki aap chunaav haare kyonki aap logon kaa vishwaas paane main peeche rah gaye
 So take responsibility for your defeat yourself, do not cast it on others

 The government's recent decision to exclude large denomination notes has affected the livelihood of some other sections as well as sex workers
 yah varg bhartiya samaaj kaa vah nichalaa tabaka he jise vastav main samaaj kaa hissaa hi nahin mana jaataa
 After the withdrawal of old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees from the midnight of 8th November by the central government, in the GB Road Red Light area of delhi, with the arrival of customers, their savings made by sexworkers are currently no longer useful

 Most of the people here do not have a bank account and hence they are confused about the use of their savings

" vah apane in 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton ko chaay kii dukaan chalaane waalon ityadi ke madhyam se khapa rahi hai
 She told that in the last 15 days, she is either taking her remuneration from brothel owners in small denomination notes or leaving it on promise of taking it later
 lekin graahakon se milane vaali bakhshish kaa upyog jo vah rosemara ke kaamkaajon, dawaaon ityadi ko kharidne main karti thim, usamen unhen kaaphi dikkat aa rahi he
 Another sexworker Shamim (name changed) told that he is having trouble changing his notes due to not having a bank account
 vahiin unki kuch saathiyon ke khate gaanvon main hai or ab apni bachat ke noton kaa istemaal karne ke liye unhen unheen khaaton kaa upyog karnaa pad rahaa he
 Apart from this, another problem is not getting new bank accounts opened because most of the women like them do not have valid documents to fulfill the 'know the customer' rule (KYC)
 tippaniyan Along with this, the livelihood of sex workers has been affected by the decrease in the arrival of customers in the redlight area
 enesdblyoo kii kusum ne bataaya ki dilli ke redlite aria main aane vaale adhiktar graahak aas-paas ke rajyon masalan haryana, uttarapradesh ke najdiki jilon se aane vaale chote kaamkaaj karne vaale log hai

" abhi unki bachat main kareeb paanch hajaar rupee ke bade mulya ke note bhi hai
 Right now what he should do with this savings is beyond his comprehension and he does not even have a bank account
 ’’ Kusum, president of All India Network of Sexworkers (AINSW), a non-governmental organization working for the rights of sex workers, told Bhasha, "the problem is about 50 percent of sex workers working here
" yahaan adhiktar ke paas bank khaataa nahin he or isliye vah apni is bachat ke upyog ko lekar asamanjas main he
 '' kusum ne kaha, ‘‘sexwarkar apni bachat ke bare main apane veshyalay ke maalikon ko bhi nahin bataa sakate kyonki isse unhen bhavishya main apni aay kam hone kaa dar rahata he
 She is spending these 500 and 1000 rupee notes through tea shop owners etc

 But she is facing difficulty in using the money she gets from customers, which she used to buy in everyday activities, medicines etc
 ek or sexwarkar samim (badla hua naam) ne bataaya ki bank khaataa nahin hone kii vajah se jahaan unhen apane noton ko badalane main dikkat ho rahi he
 At the same time, some of his colleagues have accounts in villages and now they have to use the same accounts to use their savings notes

 dilli hoicourt ne apane ek aadesh se dillisarkarko bada jhatka diya he
 The court has rejected the circular giving priority to Delhiites for treatment in Delhi Government KGTB Hospital
 yani dilli ke sarkari aspataalon main ilaaj main kisi bhi marij ke saath bhedbhaav nahin kiya jayega
 The High Court observed that the circular of the Delhi government is arbitrary and discrimination in medical services is unfair to patients in any sense
 hoicourt ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar kaa aadesh manamaana or tarkahin he
 The court said in its order that Delhi is pan India i
e
 Delhi is the capital of the country and no patient of the country can be denied treatment
 yah circular samanta ke adhikaar or jeene ke haq ke khilaaf he
 That is why we are canceling it
 court ne is maamle main yachikakarta ke is tark ko mana ki sarkari aspataalon main ilaaj karaane vaale zyaadaatar marij garib hote hai or sarkari aspataal iske liye ilaaj kaa aakiri vikalp hote he
 And here too and if the government refuses treatment, then where will they get these treatment
 hoicourt kaa yah aadesh dilli sarkaar ko turant prabhaav se lagu karnaa hoga yani ab jitibi aspataal se dilli sarkaar ko turant un bade-bade hordings ko hataanaa hoga jinamein baahar se aane vaale logon ko ilaaj kii manaahi thi
 If the administration of the hospital refuses to treat any patient from outside Delhi after this order, it will be considered contempt of court
 court se aayaa faisla bhale hi dilli sarkaar ke liye bada jhatka ho lekin garib marijon ke liye ek bahut badi raahat he
 On October 1, the Delhi government had issued a circular for ZTB Hospital stating that only patients showing Delhi's Voter ID card would get priority in treatment
 dilli ke baahar se aane vaale marijon ko is aspataal main bistar or muft davaaiyaan deni bhi band kar di thi
 The protest also started after the circular was released and a petition challenging the circular in the High Court was filed by senior advocate Ashok Aggarwal on behalf of the Social Jurist NGO
