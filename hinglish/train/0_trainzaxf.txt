 Nakoula Baisley Nakoula, who allegedly made anti-islam film in the US, has been arrested
 lekin use film ke silsile main nahin, balki ek anya maamle main mili jamaanat kii sharton ke ulanghan ke liye giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Nakoula Baisley Nakoula has been arrested following a court order in Las Angeles
 ullekhneey he ki nakoula (55) kii film 'da inosense of muslims' kii vajah se duniyabar ke muslim deshon main virodh pradarshan hue
 In what case has been arrested? Nakoula was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment by the court after he was convicted of bank fraud in 2010, but was granted bail in 2011
 par iske saath shart lagaai gai ki vah agle paanch saal tak adhikariyon kii anumati ke bagaiyr computer yaa internet kaa istemaal nahin karegaa
 The officers were keeping an eye on him whether he was following the conditions of the bail or not? 'MP ajab he, sabase gajab he' yah to madhya pradesh paryaton vibhaag kii tag line he, lekin mangalvaar ko rajya vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey bhi inhen panktiyon ko sahi tehraate najar aae
 The counting of votes, which started at 8 am yesterday, ended after more than 24 hours, yet no party got a majority
 rajya main congress sabase badi party banakar ubhari jarur lekin vah bhi 116 ke jaadui aankade se do seat dur hi rah gai
 Earlier on Tuesday, there was a heavy lift on the results throughout the day
 subah pehla rujhaan bijepi ke paksh main aayaa to thode hi der main congress ne badhat bana lee thi
 Then in the evening after noon and after evening till night, the Congress was ahead and sometimes the BJP appeared ahead
 raat ko jab siton kii tasviir thodi saaf hui to satta kii daud shuru ho gai
 Claiming to form the government, the Congress demanded a meeting with Governor Anandi Ben Patel late in the night
 party rajyapal ke saamne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karnaa chaahati thi
 Meanwhile, a round of meetings started at the house of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh
 kendriya mantri narendra singh tomars or kailash vijayawargeey samet bijepi ke kai netaa shivaraj ke saath baithkar satta hasil karne kii jugat main lag gaye
 One thing was clear from the results that neither the Congress and the BJP had an absolute majority
 donon hi dalon ko bahumat paane ke liye nirdaleey yaa sapa-basapa kaa sahaara lenaa padegaa
 The Congress had little relief in this matter
 kyonki sapa pehle hi congress ke saath jane kaa elaan kar chuki thi or basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne bhi saaf elaan kar diya ki congress ko samarthan denge
 Kamal Nath claimed that the independent mlas are in touch with us and they have enough figures to form the government
 BJP ko sarkaar gathan kaa bharosa!bijepi ne pehle to congress ke daawey par sawaal uthaae or phir vipakshi dal par matganana main deree karwaane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 The BJP said that the Congress should wait for the results and before that there is no point in seeking time from the Governor
 bijepi ne bhi nirdaleey vidhayakon ko saath laane kaa daawa kiya or khud bhi rajyapal se mulaakaat ke liye vakt maang liya
 However, at night the Governor refused to meet any party and said that no party would be given time until the Election Commission clarifies the results
 ab madhya pradesh main nattejey saaf hai
 The Congress won 114 seats in the 230-seat assembly, while the BJP was reduced to 109 seats
 rajya main basapa ko 2, sapa ko ek or 4 siton par nirdaleey ummidavaaron ko jeet mili he
 Leaders of both parties can meet the Governor today and stake claim to form their government
 buudhvaar subah se hi congress or bijepi ke khemon main sargarmi tej ho gai he
 CM Shivraj is meeting with the top leaders of the party and the BJP is preparing for every possible attempt to gain power
 kamalnath, jyotiraditya sindhiya or digvijay singh mangalvaar dopaher hi mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 Meanwhile, there are reports of four independent mlas going with the Congress
 kamalnath yaa sindhiya, CM koun?iske alaava congress ne shaam 4 baje ek baithak bulaai he jisamen mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa tay ho saktaa he
 The way Kamal Nath supporters and Scindia supporters demonstrated power over the CM post, it is believed that there may be a tussle over the CM post in the Congress
 haalanki abhi yah tay nahin he ki madhya pradesh main congress kaa mukhyamantri koun hoga lekin kamalnath kaa palada baari bataaya ja rahaa he

 However, there is some disappointment in the party after Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Swami Aseemanand accepted his role in the Samjhauta Express blast
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya mahasachiv ravishankar prasad ne bataaya, "kaaryakarini kii do divasiy baithak ke aakhir main ham teen mahatvapurn prastaav laane ja rahe hai, jinamein rajithik, aarthik or vishesh taur par purvottar kaa ek mudda shaamil hoga
 "he said," The political proposal will include 2G spectrum, corruption and scams related to the Commonwealth Games, Adarsh society scam and the Rs 1,000 crore scam in Assam's Cachar hill region
 " aseemanand dwaara samjhauta express visphot main apni bhoomika sweekaar kar liye jane ke maamle main ravishankar ne kaha ki isamen kuch nahin he
 The UPA government is trying to misuse the CBI and is falsely implicating the RSS
 unhone kaha ki congress bhrashtachar or mahangaai se aam janata kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye yah ranneeti apana rahi he
 The economic proposal of the BJP will mainly focus on rising inflation, security concerns, infiltration from Bangladesh
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or guwahati se loksabhaa sadsy bijoy chakravarti ne kaha, "bangladesh kii taraf se hone vaali ghuspaith keval assam kii hi nahin balki rashtriya samasya he

 jisamen kai pulisavaale kuch logon ke saath marpet karte nazar aa rahe hai
 Actually this video is from Sunday evening
 jahaan gramin seva kaa vaahan police kii gaadi se takaraa gaya tha, jiske baad tempo ke driver ne talwaar nikaal kar pulisavaale ke sir par maar di
 After the situation deteriorated, the police had to take a tough stand but after this the tempo driver became even more fierce
 pita tempo dryver ko pitataa dekh, bete ne police waalon par hi tempo chadhaane kii koshish kii
 a large number of people gathered on the road during this incident
 ghatana kaa video soshal media par bhi jamkar share kiya ja rahaa he
 Reacting to this, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that the matter should be investigated objectively
 iske saath hi unhone doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne kii maang bhi kii he
 Delhi Police brutality in Mukherjee Nagar is highly condemnanble and unjustified
 i demand an impartial probe into the whole incident & strict action against the guilty
 Protectors of citizens can't be allowed to turn into uncontrolled violent mobsters
 is ghatana main ek police adhikari buree tareeke se ghayal ho gaya
 The Delhi Police somehow detained the tempo driver and brought him to the local police station
 police ke mutabik tempo driver itnaa bekaabu ho gaya tha ki use kaabo karne ke liye ek pulicekarmi ko apni pistal nikaalani padi thi
 The tempo driver was beaten fiercely after snatching a sword from his hand

 Rajinder Singh, brother of former minister BJP leader Chaudhary Lal Singh in Jammu and Kashmir government, was arrested from Rajasthan on Sunday
 rajinder ne ek sabha main mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ke khilaaf apmanjanak tippanee kii thi, jiske baad se vah vaanchit chal rahe the
 It is worth mentioning that Chaudhary Lal Singh had to quit the minister post under pressure after attending a rally organized in support of the accused in the Kathua gang rape murder case
 choudhary laal singh ke bhai rajinder singh ne bhi kathua cese ko lekar hi mahabuuba ke khilaaf apshabd kahe the
 Police said they received intelligence that Rajinder was hiding in Singharajasthan, after which a special team of Jammu and Kashmir Police was sent to Rajasthan
 police ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, 'rajasthan police kii madad se rajinder singh ko jodhpur se giraftaar kar liya gaya
 They will now be brought to Hiranagar in Jammu
 'apshabd vaala bhaashan soshal media par kar diya tha posterjinder singh ne may ke aakhir saptaah main soshal media par ek video jari kiya tha, jisamen vah mahabuuba ko apshabd kahe the
 Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also condemned Rajinder's act and demanded action against him
 soshal media par vyralahue is video main rajinder singh ek choti si raily ko sambodhit karte dekhe gaye the
 In the video, he was sitting on the roof of his car in front of an open field, shouting slogans against Mehbooba to his supporters
 saamne maidan main baithe kuch logon ke hanth main tirangaa bhi tha or ve rajinder singh ke naaron par mahabuuba mufti ke liye hai-hai ke naare laga rahe the
 But for Rajinder Singh Mehbooba, shouting slogans, he said very unnatural things
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko bhale hi siton ke lihaaj se koi khaas phayda na hua ho, lekin isse congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ko jaruri siyaasi sabak jarur mil gaya he
 This is the factionalism of the senior leaders of the party
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari ke liye rahul jab chhattisgarh pahunche to unhone saaf kaha ki varisht netaa gutbaji band karen
 After all, why did the party lose elections in Chhattisgarh where it has both workers and mass base? Which are the senior leaders whose factionalism has made Rahul so upset? On this question, Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee President Nand Kumar Patel said, 'I am not a senior leader
 pradesh main saat varisht netaa hai- charan das mahant, mohasina kidawai, motilal vora, vidya charan shukla, ajit jogi, arvind netaam or parashuram bharadwaj
 However, on the question of factionalism, Patel said very clearly, 'the leaders were united before and now Rahul ji has said that if he does, he will work more unitedly
 agar do chunaav haare hai to kahin naa kahin kami to rahi hi hogi
 'seven leaders are senior to say, but Ajit Jogi and Charandas Mahant faction dominate the politics of the state
 iske alaava kabhi mahant gut ke kareebi rahe patel kaa bhi apana gut ho gaya he
 On the other hand, it was during Rahul's visit that state-nominated anglo-indian Lok Sabha MP Ingrid mcloud resigned from the party after overcoming a small issue and state in-charge B
 ke
 Hariprasad also accepted him as being disciplined, it is clear that Aam's confrontation in the party is in turmoil
 congress kii raah itani aasaan nahin he
 On the question of factionalism, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ravindra Choubey said, "these are the only three factions, no more
 rahul ji ke aahvaan ke baad party puri tarah ekajute hokar kaam kar rahi he
 'if we look at the latest situation of these three factions, Ajit Jogi's stature has reduced already
 party ke ek varisht vidhayak kehete hai, '2003 or 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main tikat vitaran main jogi kii khub chali lekin party donon chunaav haar gai
 In such a situation, his claim in the 2013 elections is sure to be weak
 ' is baar charandas mahant ko ummid he ki unhen alaakaman kii ore se tarjeeh milegi
 The question is that Patel tried to strengthen the organization, Rahul Gandhi himself patted him on the NSUI program
 lekin congress jaisi party main peeth thapthapaane or sir par mukut sajaane main kitna fark he, yah bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 Now the question in front of the party is, will she be able to manage her house? By the way, Congress got 1 from BJP in the last election
 5 fisadi hi kam vot mili the
 It is not very difficult for a united Congress to overcome this gap, but it is more difficult to unite
 dekhen, rahul kaa chumbak kya in guton ko chipka paata he, yaa phir vahi dhak ke teen paat

 dilli sarkaar ne ravivaar ko dhoomadhadake ke saath anti karpshan helpline number 1031 launch karke aam aadmi party kaa ek bada chunavi vaada puraa kiya
 But seeing a board engaged in this mega event to be held at Talkatora Stadium, it also felt that the party might be slowly getting away from the issue of VIP culture, as the board of VVIP parking was hanging at the stadium's entry
 is viviipi parking ke board ko dekhakar shaayad isliye bhi hairaani ho rahi thi, kyonki aam aadmi party ke mukhya agenda main viipi culture ko khatm karnaa bhi shaamil he
 On this, Congress leader Ajay Maken also tweeted raising questions and wrote that within 50 days the Aam Aadmi Party became the party of VIP and VVIP
 Just passed through the Talkatora Stadium- Look at the pictures- How in just 50 days AAP became a party of VIP&VVIP? pic

 com / oogpqewsd5 However, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Adarsh shastri defends the party saying that the party has not moved away from the issue of abolishing VIP culture
 laal batti kaa ham upyog nahin karte hai lekin kaaryakartaaon kii sahuuliyat ke liye viipi parking banaai gai thi taaki bade netaaon se unhen dikkat na ho
 Not only this, many buses were also seen in this program to gather the crowd, which brought workers from different places in Delhi to Talkatora Stadium
 khud silampur se aae mujahid ne bataaya ki hamaare vidhayak ne bas kaa intjaam kiya he
 Similarly, many mlas have brought workers from their respective areas in buses
 is samaaroh main kaaryakartaaon ke manoranjan ke liye bhojpuri sangeetkaaron ko bhi bulaayaa gaya tha
 Seeing the large number of police, paramilitary force and bouncers in the program, other political parties were experiencing the ceremony
 haalanki congress or bijepi jaisi bahut sari partiyon main isi tarah ke chaal-chalan maujuud he
 But the criticism of the Aam Aadmi Party will be because the insistence on doing politics apart from these parties makes Arvind Kejriwal as the face
 to kya aam aadmi party bhi duusare raajnneetik partiyon kii tarah vyavhaarik raajnneeti karne kii disha main chal padi he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader himself

 ab rail kiraaya or maal haada mantralay kii bajaay rail tarriff athurity tay karegi
 Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge made this announcement while presenting the Interim Rail Budget in Parliament on Wednesday
 rail mantri ne haalanki apane bhaashan main rail kiraaye main kisi tarah ke badlaav kii ghoshnaa nahin kii
 But made an important announcement towards increasing the fare
 rail mantri ne apane bajet bhaashan main tarriff athurity kii jaankaree dene se pehle unhone yah mashhoor sher padhaa, 'kabhi chilman se wo jhanke, kabhi chilman se ham jhanke
 Put fire in the fire, neither look at them, nor we peep
 ' iske baad khadge ne loksabhaa spikar mira kumaar ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'madam, hamane chilman main aag laga di
 Kharge said that an independent rail tariff authority is being set up to advise the government on fixing fares and freight as per the out-of-the-box decision
 ab kiraaya tay karnaa parde ke peeche kaa kaam nahin hoga jahaan yujar gupt rup se hi pataa laga sakate the ki duusari ore kya ho rahaa he?rail mantri ne kaha ki rail tarriff athurity railway kii jaruraton par hi vichaar nahin karegaa, balki ek paardarshee prakriya ke jariye sabhi steke-holders ko bhi shaamil karke keemat tay karne kii vyavastha shuru karegaa
 This will initiate a round of rationalization of rail fares and freight to improve the fare and freight ratio
 dhire–dhire vibhinn kshetron ke bich cross-sabsidigeshan ko kam kiya ja sakegaa
 It is hoped that this will help improve the financial condition of the railways and bring stability to the revenue stream

 a Delhi court dismissed the bail plea of sudhindra Kulkarni, an accused in the 2008 scam vote vote scam and former aide of BJP leader LK Advani
 vishesh nyaayadhish sangeeta dhingra sahagal ne kulkarni ke alaava purv bhaajapa saansadon faggan singh kulaste or mahavir singh bhagora ko bhi jamaanat dene se inkaar kar diya
 The judge said sorry, i am not giving bail to all of you
 kulkarni kii antarim jamaanat arji khaarij hone ke baad vah nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail main hai
 He appeared before the court on September 27 after summoning the court
 kulaste or bhagora ko chah sitambar ko rajyasabha sadsy amar singh ke saath giraptaar kiya gaya tha
 While dismissing the bail pleas, the court said that when the accused got illegal money, they had enough time to inform the law enforcement agencies
 teenon aropiyon ke alaava rajyasabha sadsy amar singh, unke purv sahyogi sanjeev saxena or bhaajapa kaaryakarta suhail hindustani bhi maamle main shaamil rahane ke aarope main nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 The court termed the acts of the accused as serious
 nyaayadhish ne ek nijee tivi channel dwaara karaaye gayi sting aaparishan kii sidi kaa bhi zikr karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa saansadon ko rishwat lete dekha gaya he
 The Crime Branch of the Delhi Police, in its charge sheet, described Kulkarni as the mastermind of the note-for-vote scam, stating that he kept in touch with the conspirators of the case and was present while giving 'illegal bribes' to BJP mps
 police ne kaha tha ki kulkarni ko is baat kaa pataa tha ki bhaajapa ke teen saansadon- kulaste, bhagora or ashok argal ko dhan kaa bhugtan kiya gaya he, lekin unhone is bare main kanoon pravartan agenciyon ko suchit nahin kiya
 Kulkarni has been charged under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act
 bihar main endie ke seat bantwaare kaa ravivaar ko elaan ho gaya
 As per the fixed formula, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal United (JDU) will contest in 17-17 seats, while Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) will contest 6 seats
 seat shering ke formule se is baat kii charchaa he ki kya ramvilas paswan or unki party asli apni baat manwaane main kaamyaab rahi he? kyonki loksabhaa siton ke saath ramvilas paswan ko rajyasabha ke agle chunaav main endie se ummidavaar banane kii bhi deal hui he
 Earlier on Sunday afternoon, CM Nitish Kumar arrived at Amit Shah's residence in Delhi
 lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan or unke bete chiraag paswan bhi baithak main hajir rahe
 In Bihar, there were reports of BJP 18, JDU 17 and LJP contesting 5 seats and the formula for giving one seat of Rajya Sabha to LJP was also decided
 amit shah ne apni press conference main isi baat par muhar laga di
 Significantly, BJP President Amit Shah had already announced that BJP and JDU will contest on equal seats in Bihar
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main endie ne loksabhaa kii 31 siten jiti thim
 In the last election, the BJP fielded candidates for 30 Lok Sabha seats, winning 22, while Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP won 6 seats and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) won three seats
 haalanki is baar upendra kushvaha kii party araspi endie kaa hissaa nahin he kyonki unhone seat shering par apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi or santoshjanak siten na milane kii ashanka main gathbandhan chhod diya tha
 According to political experts, the BJP has given LJP 6 seats and one Rajya Sabha candidature, indicating that it does not want to annoy LJP under any circumstances
 upendra kushvaha kii tarah agar ramvilas paswan bhi bidak jate to desh main iskaa kharaab sanket jaataa
 This would have increased the possibility of scattered NDA in other states as well
 saath hi, bihar main paswan endie ke akele dalit chehre hai, jin par gathbandhan daanv lagaana chahta he
 Keeping this in mind, the BJP made a big sacrifice, only compromising on 17 seats
 paswan ne siton ke bantwaare par apni baat manavaai he to iske peeche unke bete chiraag paswan kaa bhi bada role he
 Amid reports of scattering in the NDA, LJP leader Chirag Paswan had tweeted that the alliance is going through a delicate phase after the TDP and RLSP split from the NDA
 isliye bijepi gathbandhan kii partiyon kii chintaaon ko samay rahete dur kare
 At the same time, opposition is getting stronger in Bihar
 congress or argedy kai choti partiyon ko lamaband kar rahi hai jiskaa asar aagaamee aam chunaav par pad saktaa he
 Paswan's party dominates the Dalit vote bank of many seats in Bihar, which the BJP does not want to lose under any circumstances
 loksabhaa main lojpa ke chah saansad hai, jabaki bihar vidhansabha main do vidhayak he
 However, there is no MP for this party in the Rajya Sabha, which Paswan is preparing to complete this time
 paswan kaa lagbhag puraa parivaar saansad he
 Given the base of the Dalit vote bank in those parliamentary constituencies, the BJP does not want to endanger the NDA as the fight in one seat will be crucial given the anti-incumbency wave in the 2019 elections
 ramvilas paswan ko rajyasabha bheje jane ke peeche kii taiyaari ye he ki ve apni kharaab sehat ke chalate chunaav ladanaa nahin chaahate
 Instead they want to go to Rajya Sabha
 duusari ore kaha yah ja rahaa tha ki araspi ke endie main rahete lojpa saat siton se kam par raji nahin thi, jabaki bijepi itani siten dene ko taiyaar nahin thi
 The BJP is on the back foot after losing in three states
 udhar chiraag paswan ke twit ne bhi bijepi haikaman ko saaf sandesh de diya ki agar unhen manmutabik siten na milin to ve bhi tidipi or araspi kii tarah chunaav se thik pehle apni raah alag kar sakate hai
 In view of all these issues, in seat sharing, BJP took full care of its coalition partners and gave them the seats they wanted
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main agle pradhanmantri pad ke liye votaron kii pasand alag-alag jati samoohon main banty nazar aa rahi he
 Narendra Modi is the first choice for the post of PM among the general category, Other Backward Class (OBC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) voters
 vahiin muslimon or anusuchit jati (ST) ke votaron main congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi se adhik he
 These findings came from a survey conducted by axis-my-india for India Today's Political Stock Exchange (PSE)
 saamaanya varg, OBC se modi ko banpar samarthatprail PSE survey ke aankade bataate hai ki narendra modi ko sabase adhik 73% samarthan saamaanya varg se mil rahaa he
 In this category, Modi was getting support of 72% voters in March and 57% in January
 is varg main rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata kaa aankada sirf 17% he
 Rahul was getting 15% support in March from this category and 26% in January

 6 years to this film that was all heart and changed my life! # raanjhanaa @sonamkapoor @dhanushkraja @aanandlrai @mohdzeeshanayyub # himanshusharma @cypplofficial @erosnowa post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Jun 21, 2019 at 7:04am pdtthese are stills from # raanjhanaa Of the # holi sequence that we filmed in # banaras in the freezing winter of mid-december 2012! Writer # himanshusharma had beautifully written a grand Holi sequence into the screenplay capturing the energy, scale, bhaang-induced madness of Banaras's traditional Holi
 It took us 3 days to shoot and the days were chosen 20, 21 and 22 December the COLDEST days of the year
 The art department had also constructed a keechad (mud / slush) pool, very thoughtfully filled with warm water which soon turned cold!!! There were almost 200 plus junior artists used for the scene, some of whom were pouring buckets of water from terraces on us while we ran through the streets
 i was scared of slipping and thus was barefoot !!! i have NEVER been so cold in my life as i was those three days
 But it was the MOST fun i've ever had shooting
 It was also the first time in my life that i played Holi in a sari
 
 The production was very sweet and kept blankets and buckets of hot water ready for us while we waited between shots
 Interestingly the writer Himanshu Sharma was missing during the filming of this sequence, he did not come on set as all the actors had sworn to throw him into the keechad pool for writing such a long and vast Holi sequence! :) # throwback # shootlife # raanjhanaamemories # 6yearsofraanjhanaaa post shared by Swara Bhasker (@reallyswara) on Jun 22, 2019 at 3:49am pdtsosala media par hameshaa active rahane vaali actress swara bhaskar (swara Bhasker) ne apni film 'rajhana' (raanjhanaa) ke 6 saal puure hone par apane instagram account se kuch tasviren post kii hai

 On this post of 'actress Swara Bhasker, many fans congratulated him on the completion of 6 years of the film
 lekin kuch yugers ne swara bhaskar kii photo par modi-modi ke naare likh die
 Let me tell you that in the year 2013 film Raanjhanaa, South actors Dhanush, Sonam Kapoor, Abhay Deol and Swara Bhasker were also seen in the lead roles
 is film main dhanush or sonam kapur kii acting kii kaaphi saraahna hui thi
 This film was so spectacular that even today some of its dialogues remain on people's tongues
 is film kii aadhi shooting varanasi main to aadhi dilli main hui thi
 'raanjhanaa' joined the Rs 100 crore club at the box office as soon as it was released in theaters
 dilli se sate noida ke posh ilaake main ek yuvati kii ped se lataki laash milane se sansani fail gai
 In the preliminary inquiry, the police is investigating it as a case of murder
 noida ke posh ilaake sector-25 ke em block main ravivaar subah us vakt hadakamp much gaya, jab rahgeeron ne 20 feet oonchai par ek yuvati keeped se lataki lashdekhi
 People immediately informed the police that the body was found

 The police immediately rushed the dead body from the tree and sent it for postmortem
 praathmik jaanch main police ise hatya kaa maamla maanate hue jaanch kar rahi he
 The dead person has not been identified yet

 Police are currently interrogating the local people
 vahiin police team ilaake main lagesisitivi cameronki bhi madad le rahi he
 People in the area have been appalled by the incident of murder in the posh area and then the hanging of the corpse from the tree
 vahiin chahal-pahal vaale is sector main katl kii vaardaat se suraksha vyavastha par bhi kai gambhir sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 The Delhi High Court, in one of its orders, ordered the National Herald House to be vacated
 iske khilaaf supreme court main apil kii gai thi
 On which the Supreme Court has currently stayed the order to vacate
 yachika par sunwaayee karke hue chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki hamen yah tay karnaa he ki kya AJL dwaara yang indian main share kaa transfar karnaa lij ke transfar karne samaan hoga? aapako bataa den ki dilli sthit herald house ko khaali karne ke aadesh ko chunauti dene vaali assocatid jarnals limited ( AJL ) kii yachika supreme court ne sunwaayee kii thi
 The AJL has appealed to the Supreme Court to stay the February 28 Delhi High Court ruling asking the Herald House to vacate
 yachika main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki supreme court centre sarkaar ko nirdesh jari kare ki wo herald house khaali karne ko lekar koi karrwai naa kare or koi kathor kadam naa uthaae
 The petition has also sought a stay on the Urban Development Ministry's notice of vacating the Herald House of 30 October 2018

 Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said on Saturday that Vinod Rai, the former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has been given the responsibility to develop a transparent mechanism for the functioning and functioning of the Ministry of Railways
 prabhu ne kaha, 'maine apane purv sieji vinod raay se kaha he, jinaki eemaandaaree ke sabhi kaayal hai
 i have requested him to give us directions on measures to make the functioning of the Railways transparent
 ' Rai had highlighted corruption in 2G spectrum allocation and coal block allocation as CAG
 prabhu konkan railway dwaara karmali railway stesan par yojit ek kaarykram main bol rahe the
 He also said that the ministry would soon launch a website, which would serve as an interface for the railway station development plan
 website par sambandhit nividakartaon dwaara taiyaar railway steshnon kii dizin or namoonay maujuud rahenge or isse yah prakriya adhik paardarshee or samaveshi hogi
 In the midst of the Lok Sabha election campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given an interview in which all aspects of his personal life have come out of politics
 yah intervyuu bollywood star akshay kumaar ne liya he
 In this, PM put things related to his family and personal life in front of the world
 is intervyuu main piem modi ne yah bataaya he ki aakhir vah apni kalai main ulti ghadi kyon baandhte hai
 PM Modi said that he ties the clock in the opposite direction to the wrist because often he has to watch the time during the meeting, he does not want the people sitting in front to know about it
 unhone kaha ki unhen jab kabhi aisi baithkon main samay dekhne kii jarurat hoti he to ulti disha main ghadi hone kii vajah se vah aaraam se dekh lete hai or logon ko iskaa pataa hi nahin chalata
 PM Modi said that if the wrist will rotate and watch the clock repeatedly during the meeting, then people sitting in the meeting will not feel good
 isse pehle kya piem modi ko aam khaanaa pasand he, is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue piem modi ne bataaya ki unhen aam khaanaa pasand he
 The PM said, "there was no ability to buy mangoes in the kind of family conditions, so farmers used to stop eating in the fields
 ped se pakaa hua aam khaanaa pasand tha'
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also talked about his dream in the interview, he said that the idea of becoming Prime Minister never came to his mind
 unhone kaha ki saamaanya logon ke man main ye vichaar aata bhi nahin hai or meraa jo family becoground he usamen mujhe koi choti naukari mil jaati to meri maa usee main puure gaanv ko gud ke pue khilaa detii
 How does PM Modi calm anger? On this question, PM Modi said that if there is any incident which he did not like, then he used to sit alone with the paper
 us ghatana kaa varnan likhata tha, kya hua kyon hua
 Then he used to tear the paper and throw it away
 phir bhi man shant nahin hota tha to dobaaraa us ghatnakram ko likhata tha
 This burns all my feelings after writing
 isse ye bhi ehsaas ho jaataa he ki main bhi galat hum
 PM Modi said that he was affected by the 1962 war
 unhone kaha, 'jab kabhi fuj vaale nikalate the to bacchon kii tarah khadaa hokar unhen sailyut karata tha tabhi man karata tha ki sena main bhartee ho jaaun
 ' rashtriya paathyakram dhaanche (ensief 2005) ke kriyanvayan main ensiiarti (rashtriya shaikshanik anusandhan evam prashikshan parishad) ne jo tarika apanaaya tha, usne itihaas samet tamaam schuli text book kii tasviir hi badal daali he
 Our past books from class 6 to 8 have a new perspective in the textbooks
 iskaa itihaas bataata he ki kis tarah alag-alag kshetra, samoohon or mahilaon samet aam logon ne ateet kaa anubhav kiya
 The difference in approach and structure is also evident in the textbooks of large classes
 nai paathya pustaken bataati hai ki itihaaskaar kaise kaam karte hai, kaise ve apane stroton or saakshyon kaa istemaal karte hai or kaise ek hi ghatana kii do bhinn vyakhyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 There were some orthodox things in the old books, whose basis was not clear
 nai kitaaben bacchon main vishleshan kshamta or itihasbodh paidaa karne kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 In the old syllabus and text-books, some subjects were treated with great hesitation
 mana jaataa tha ki vistaar se charchaa ke liye ve vishay behad samvedansheel hai
 Partition of the country was one such subject, which was left outlined in exactly the official style
 maine 1998 main jab bhartiya or pakistani paathya pustakon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan shuru kiya (baad main jo 2001 main penguin se prisyudis and pride ke naam se chapa) to maine paaya ki donon deshon main saajhe ateet kaa gyaan dene vaale do itihaason ke fark ko samajhane main vibhaajan kii dharna kendriya he
 My study used to say that Pakistani children are shown as Partition Fatah, whereas Indian children are described as tragedy
 donon hi maamalon main paathya pustaken yah bataa paane main naakaam raheen ki vibhaajan aakhir kaise itnaa aprihaary ban gaya or kaise yah apane saath itani tabaahi or khun-kharaba lekar aayaa
 This is not the case with the new NCERT books
 kaksha 12 kii pustak bhartiya itihaas ke kuch ansh bhaag-3 main vistaar se vibhaajan par baat kii gai he
 It balances between the political dimensions of partition and the pain and shock inflicted on crores of people on both sides of the border
 abhilekhaagaar ke chitron, maukhik aakhyaanon or vidambnaaon ke sahare baat kii gai he
 Background-related information has been provided in the margins and in the box, while in the text, students have been tried to relate to the process that governed the politics of the fourth decade
 ant main die gaye abhyaas prashn aise hai, jo bacchon main nae sawaalon or vipareet tathyon ke prati jigyaasa paidaa karte hai
 For India, this amazing achievement is indeed a matter of satisfaction, because despite the signing of several SAARC manifestos by representatives of both countries, Pakistan has nothing to say on text book reform
 bharat nishchit taur par ensiiarti ke is gauravshaalee kaam par santosh jataa saktaa he
 Despite this, the quality of the text books run by the state boards is still poor
 kuch rajyon ne to ensiiarti kii hi kitaaben dobaaraa mudrit karvaa lee hai, lekin adhiktar rajya board apana intjaam khud hi karte hai
 The condition of secondary and senior secondary school books in most state boards is poor
 punjab or pashchim bengal is maamle main sabase buree sthiti main hai
 These are the states which have directly suffered the pain of partition
 sochaa ja saktaa he ki in donon rajyon main vibhaajan par adhyyon ko tarjeeh di jaani chahie, lekin sach yahaan ulataa he
 The division is still lying somewhere in the course
 ise is tarah se pesh kiya gaya he goyaa pakistan aazaadee kii ladaai kii nazaij paidaaish ho
 Since history comes to an end after the formation and independence of Pakistan, the teacher does not need to mention it to the children any time
 natijatan pakistan, ek noujvaan or shikshit mastishk ke bheetar hameshaa ke liye nakaaratmak chhavi liye haashiye par chupchaap padaa rah jaataa he
 In Punjab the subject of division is in the syllabus of 11th
 yahaan em
 s
 sodhi kii kitaab history of india chalati he, jisamen vibhaajan ke prabhaav ko 15 linon ke ek naatakeey para main nibata diya gaya he
 There is no place for descriptions, pictures or exercises involving students
 iskaa samoochaa uddeshy bacchon ko imtihaan paas karwaanaa he
 Children also have no other work left to remember it
 12veen kaksha kii itihaas kii kitaab bhi isi lekhak kii likhi hui he, jisamen 1469 se 1869 ke bich punjab kaa kshetreey itihaas shaamil he
 The book is buried in the details of medieval history
 akraman, vijay, hatyaein chote-chote vivaran ke saath maujuud hai
 No scope for analysis
 duusare angrej-sikh yuddh ke paar jane kii jagah paathyakram main chodi hi nahin gai he, lihaaja bacchon ko un chunautiyon se parichit karwaane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta, jo aarthik, rajnatik or saamaajik daayre main aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya ke sandarbh main punjab ko darpesh ain
 Nor is there any scope that children from Indian Punjab will be able to learn anything about Punjab beyond the border or at least become curious
 nishchit taur par rajya kii shaikshanik niti kaa yah uddeshy to nahin he, na hi yah uddeshy bengal kii shaikshanik niti kaa he, jahaan kii paathya-pustaken punjab jitani hi ghatiya or sankeern hai
 Obviously, these two are no exception
 desh ke adhiktar rajya bordon main pichley 50 saal ke dauraan paathyakram taiyaar karne, paathya pustaken taiyaar karne yaa unki sifarish karne or parikshaayen yojit karne kii kshamta ke sandarbh main bamushkil maamuli badlaav hue hai
 The recommendations of the Amrik Singh Committee are gathering dust in government offices
 ensiiarti rajya ke bordon ke saath jo salanaa conference karata he, usase bhi paathyakram yaa paathya-pustak taiyaar karne main kisi nae vichaar kaa sutarapaat yaa is vishay main samvaad nahin hua he
 In most of the states, the preparation of syllabus and writing of text books is done by the State Board of SCERT at the primary level, but this institution is weak
 inke paas na to sthaayee staff he, na hi iskaa koi asar he
 In view of these conditions our overall capacity for quality of textbooks is very poor
 sibiesai se manyata praapt skool kam-se-kam kaksha 8 ke baad to ensiiarti kii kitaaben hi chalaane ko baadhya hai, lekin ve samaaj ke sampann tabake ko shiksha dete hai
 On the other hand, school boards recognized by state boards are used for the children of villagers and laborers
 pakistan kii kahani bhi isse koi alag nahin
 There, too, private schools that teach children of the rich section run books printed from the finest Oxford University Press, while the children of the common man thrive on the fertility of religious ideology
 donon hi deshon main prabhaavshaalee amir tabake ne apane bacchon ke liye saaf-suthri vyavastha kii hui he or aam bacchon ko pichhadi sarkari vyavastha se jujhne ke liye chhod diya he
 If peace between India and Pakistan is to be the target of educational policies, more corrective energy will be consumed in both countries than ever before
 bharat main ham pakistan se is maamle main aage hai ki hamane rashtriya str par kam-se-kam paathyakram main sudhaar kiya he
 Maintaining it at the state level is not an easy task
 sawaal sirf paathya pustakon ko puraane dharre par chalate rahane se rokane bhar kaa nahin he
 Along with books that inspire children to think, it is necessary to have teachers who have been trained to encourage ideological freedom in children
 bharat or pakistan donon deshon main aise shikshakon kaa jabardast abhaav he
 In the last few decades, choosing to teach children in both countries has become an insurmountable task
 shaikshanik sudhaar kii disha main paathyakram or paathya pustakon main nayaapan laana sirf pehla kadam he
 The next front is teacher training and examination
 yadi hamen jang main apane sansaadhan barabaad karne se bachanaa he, to shikshakon ke bheetar ateet ke prati ek paripakv drushtikon ko poshit karnaa praathamikta kaa kaam hona chahie
 But for this, it is necessary that the text books of the states, which have been created on the fight for freedom and subsequent incidents, should be removed first
 ye kitaaben anjaane main hi hamaare padosi ke prati sthaayee duraagrah or aakrosh kaa poshan kar rahi hai
 Perhaps this will usher in a new change
 samuhik dushkarm kii ghatana se acroshit logon se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil karte hue dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne ravivaar ko kaha ki jarurat ko dekhte hue ati vishisht vyaktiyon (viipi) kii suraksha main katautee kar janata kii suraksha badhaai jaani chahie
 After meeting with Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, Sheela told reporters that i want to emphasize that if necessary, the security of vips should be cut and the public safety should be enhanced
 dilli sarkaar ne viipi kii suraksha main surakshakarmiyon kii tainaati sahit police kii tainaati main yuktikaran kii maang kii he
 Sheila Dixit said that you often find that due to preference of VIP security, we are not able to pay attention to ordinary citizens
 ullekhneey he ki dilli main suraksha vyavastha centre sarkaar ke adheen he
 This is the reason that in the wake of the December 16 gang-rape incident, he did not shy away from criticizing the police system
 jail main kaidiyon ko priscnce act or priscnce minial ke tahat milti hai suvidhaayengel main kaidiyon ke saath durvyavhaar karne yaa krurta baratane kii nahin he ijajatpurv kendriya mantri or congress ke kaddavar netaa pi chidambaram ke jail jane ke baad se sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir jail main kaidiyon ko kaise rakhaa jaataa he? unako kya-kya suvidhaayen di jaati hai? kaidiyon ke saath kaisaa bartaav kiya jaataa he? jail main band kaidiyon ke kya adhikaar hote hai?is sambandh main supreme court ke edwocket upendra mishra kaa kahana he ki jail prashasan or kaidiyon ke adhikaar or kartavyon ko lekar priscnce act-1894 or model priscnce minial banaae gaye hai
 Apart from this, Delhi Prisons Act 2002 has also been enacted to regulate the jails of Delhi
 inamen jail main band kaidiyon ko paryaapt suvidhaayen dene or unke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye praavdhaan kiye gaye hai
 Advocate Mishra said that under the Model Prisons Manual, under trial prisoners are given more rights than prisoners convicted of any crime
 unhone bataaya ki samvidhan main kaidiyon ko bhi moulik adhikaar die gaye hai
 Being a prisoner does not necessarily mean that all their fundamental rights have been lost
 jail main krurta hone par supreme court ja sakate hai kaidisupreme court ke edwocket mishra kaa kahana he ki kanoon dwaara sthapit prakriya ke bina kisi bhi kaidi ko uske moulik adhikaron se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The law does not allow mistreatment or inhuman treatment of a prisoner or for cruelty
 agar jail main kisi kaidi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he, to vah anuchhed 32 ke tahat sidhe supreme court or anuchhed 226 ke tahat sidhe hai court kaa darwaja khatkhata saktaa he
 Free medical facility and legal advice in the jail, Upendra Mishra said that the Supreme Court has also clearly stated that the prisoners in the prison cannot be treated like animals
 jail prashasan or sarkaar kii jimmedaari he ki wo jail main band kaidiyon ko wo sabhi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaaen, jo rosemara kii jindagi ke liye jaruri hai
 According to the Model Jail Manual, inmates are given plenty of facilities including clean water, fresh food, clothes to wear, bedding and medical facilities
 iske alaava kaidiyon ko muft main kanoonee salaah, parijanon ko khat likhane kii suvidha or mulaakaat karne kii ijaajat, rojgaar or kai baar under trial kaidi ko media se baatcheet karne kii ijaajat bhi di jaati he
 Along with this, security is also provided to the prison inmate
 agar kisi kaidi ko jail jane se pehle kisi special category kii suraksha mili he, to usko vishesh suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaati he
 The prisoner gets a nutritious meal of 2400 calories, according to the Model Prisons Manual, only 250 prisoners are cooked in a kitchen
 iske zyada kaidi hone par unke liye duusare kichan kii vyavastha kii jaati he
 There are tiles up to 2 meters in such kitchens
 model priscnce minial ke mutabik jahaan kaidiyon ke liye khaanaa banataa he, wo kichan hitech hote hai
 Adequate lighting is provided in it
 jail main kaidiyon ke liye alpiji gas se khaanaa banaaya jaataa he
 Prisoners are provided with other best facilities including bread making machine, flour making machine and hot plate
 kaidiyon ko aisa khaanaa diya jaataa he, jisamen calories kii maatra 2,000 se lekar 2,400 tak hoti he
 According to the Model Prisons Manual, prisoners are given breakfast in the morning, lunch (lunch) and then dinner (dinner) in the jail
 naashtaa, lunch or dinar taaja diya jaataa he
 Cold or stale food is not given
 iske alaava agar kaidi ko khaanaa ko lekar kisi tarah kii dikkat he, to wo isaki shikaayat bhi kar saktaa he
 Prisoners are given food according to their health requirements and the environment of the area
 kaidiyon kii khuraaq medical adhikari kii salaah se nirdhaarit kiya jayega
 Under trial prisoners are allowed to wear clothes from their homes, but convicted inmates are not allowed such clothes
 chidambaram under trial kaidi hai
 So they are allowed to wear clothes of their choice
 model priscnce minial ke mutabik kaidiyon ke liye alag se hospital hota he, jisamen doctor se lekar dawaaen tak ilaaj kii sabhi suvidhaayen uplabdh hoti hai
 If we speak in a colloquial language, the hospitals of the jail are no less than any high-tech hospitals at the district level
 maansik rog ke shikaar kaidiyon ke liye manochikitsak bhi rakhe jate hai
 Apart from this, arrangements have also been made to provide free legal aid to the prisoners in jail
 kaidiyon ko kaam karne par miltaa he mehtanamodel priscnce minial ke mutabik kaidiyon ko jail ke andar kaam karne kii ijaajat di jaati he, jiske evaj main unako mehtaanaa diya jaataa he
 No prisoner can be employed for free
 bina mehtaanaa ke kaam karaane se kaidi ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan hota he
 That is, under the law, the prisoners living in jail also have the rights, on the basis of which they can avoid wrong behavior with them
 ravindra jadeja or james anderson ke bich jhagade ko lekar uthaa tufaan ab jabaki tham gaya he tab england ke purv captain mike brairali ne kaha ki is tej gendbaaj ko apni aakraamakata dekhne ke liye utsahit kiya janaa chahie lekin sammaan kii keemat par nahin
 Brearley wrote in his column in 'the Times' that once Anderson crosses the line of proper respect, then he cannot become a role model for anyone
 unhone kaha, ‘in garmiyon main jab ravindra jadeja ke saath jhagada pehali baar prakashit hua to england ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki prabandhan apane mukhya gendbaaj kaa paksh legaa
 'brearley said,' i agree with the competition
 ek sheersh khilaadi main ise hona chahie
 In such an attitude, there should be respect for the opponent
 anderson (or anya) ko aakraamakata ke liye utsahit kiijie lekin iske saath hi uski kuch harkaton or tippaniyon kaa virodh karnaa bhi jaruri he
 On the second day of the first Test match at Trentbridge, when the players were going for lunch, Anderson allegedly abused Jadeja and pushed him
 isisi ke nyaayik ayog ne haalanki anderson ko doshi nahin qaraar diya or baad main isisi ne bhi bisisiai ke faisle kii samiksha karne kii apil ko naamanzoor kar diya
 He said, 'first, they were disturbed by Anderson's conduct on the field and the second is a sacred place where aggression and competition rules and sportsmanship have more freedom than the monotonous and humble social circle outside the field
 Can be expressed with
 ’brairali ne kaha, ‘isliye anderson ko apni aakraamakata kaa istemaal karne ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie taaki vah apane bejod kaushal kaa bharpoor istemaal kar sake lekin use sammaan or hasya kii keemat par aisa karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie

 The Shiv Sena has said that it is unfortunate for Veer Savarkar, who conceptualized the Hindu nation and made an unprecedented sacrifice in the freedom struggle, not to receive the Bharat Ratna despite public sentiment
 shivasena ne apane akhbaar saamana main likhe sampadakeey main aarope lagaaya he ki congressi shashan main vir saavarkar kii upeksha or apmaan hua
 But what did the Modi government do to avenge that insult? While in the opposition party, the BJP people used to urge Veer Savarkar to be given the Bharat Ratna
 lekin modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ayodhya main ram mandir nahin bana or vir saavarkar ko bharat ratna bhi nahin mila, yah durbhaagya he
 Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena has written that PM Modi visited Andaman in the last week of December
 jahaan unhone vahaan kii celular jail, jisamen vir saavarkar ne kaala pani kii sajaa kaati thi, kuch pal gujaarey the or aankh mundakar chintan kiya tha
 That thought flowed into the sea of andaman
 gauratlab he ki is ganatantr diwas par purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee, samajasevak nanaaji deshmukh or sangeet ke kshetra main bhupen hajarika ko desh ke sarvocch puraskaar bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 The Shiv Sena said that the Sena supported Pranab Mukherjee when he contested the President, taking into consideration the merit of the senior leader and former President Pranab Mukherjee, who was prepared in the Congress environment, now being praised by the Modi government
 
 tab bijepi ne hamaara virodh kiya or unke khilaaf apana ummidavaar bhi maidan main utaara
 Shiv Sena has raised the question that Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that Pranab Babu is the guide of politics, administration, Bhishma Pitamah and he took over us during the presidency
 phir itane mahaan vyaktitv ko modi sarkaar ne dobaaraa mauka diya hota to yah chunaav nirvirodh hua hota
 But for the second time Ramnath Kovind was appointed in place of the same great merit
 tab nakaare gaye pranab mukherjee aaj modi raaj main bharat ratna tehraae gaye
 By doing this, the BJP has confirmed that the support of Pranab Mukherjee as the President of Shiv Sena was right
 haalanki shivasena ne kaha he ki jinhen bhi padam puraskaar or bharat ratna diya gaya he ve apane-apane sthaan par yogya he
 But despite repeated demands and intense public sentiment, why did freedom fighter Savarkar not receive the Bharat Ratna award? What such a shortcoming appeared in Veer Savarkar that the Modi government could not respect him
 shivasena ke alaava desh ke sarvocch puraskaar par jari bahes main eimm ke mukhiya or saansad asaduddin ovaisi bhi kud pade hai
 Owaisi has raised questions as to how many of the people who have been awarded the Bharat Ratna so far are dalit-muslim or Adivasi? Apart from Owaisi, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge has raised many other questions on the Bharat Ratna issue

 According to Sunil Gavaskar "age affects every field and the same happens in cricket, but Dhoni is still the best match finisher in India at the moment
 " However, captain Dhoni himself has said that he now wants to bat a little higher in the batting order by handing over the responsibility of the finisher to someone else

 Actually, the removal of Khanduri was a big problem for the BJP because the action over Khanduri sparked a wave of dissatisfaction with the BJP leadership even in those states where the party did not perform well
 isliye baakiyon ko bachaane ke liye bijepi ne khanduri kii bali lenaa sahi nahin samajha
 But this decision may put a crisis on the BJP government of Uttarakhand

 (inputs bhashaa se) Yogeshwar Dutt 33 years old, Wrestling Man's freestyle 65 kg category: March 19, 2016, Astana Achievements: 2 gold medals in the Commonwealth Games, 1 gold medal in the Asian Games, the last Olympics: Bronze medals in the 2012 London Olympics are a strange figure
 Yogeshwar Dutt is somewhat dangerous Extremely sensitive too
 shaayad unke chaude kandhe, gatha hua seenaa or peeth unki patali qamar se mail nahin khaati
 Just 5 feet 7 inches, Yogeshwar is the tallest Indian wrestler to go to Rio who will lead the wrestling team
 kushti akeli aisi vyaktigat spardhaa he jisamen olympic khelon main desh kii viraasat he
 Wrestling has been a part of life in India for centuries
 puraane jamaane main pahalwaan shahi darbar main apane hunar dikhaate the or pratidwandviyon ko dhobi pachhad dekar vaahvahee ke saath hi inaam bhi jitate the
 Today, these courts have been replaced by Chandgi Ram and Satpal Singh, whose mud-holds have kept the old stakes of wrestling alive
 chandagi ram ne 1970 ke asian khelon main swarna padak jeeta or munich 1972 main bhaag liya
 He died in 2010
 satpal ab bhi dilli ke chhatrasaal stadium main yuva pahalawaanon ko prashikshit karte hai
 He participated in the 1980 Moscow Olympics and won a gold medal at the 1982 Asian Games
 bharat kaa pehla vyaktigat olympic medal bhi kushti main hi aayaa tha jise khashaaba dada sahib jadhav ne 1952 ke helsinki olympic main jeeta tha
 44 years later, tennis player Leander Paes at the Atlanta Olympics gave the long-suffering eyes a medal
 lihaaja, aaj yogeshwar ke kandhon par itihaas kii aas puri karne or nai ummid bhare is daur main bhartiya khelon main kushti kii ahmiyat barkaraar rakhane kaa jimmaa he
 Yogeshwar is well aware that due to his discipline and values, these are working as nurseries for new talent, but he also has a good sense of what is needed to win an Olympic medal in the present time
 And what kind of practice abounds
 sonipat main bhartiya khel praadhikaran ke ek prashikshan shivi ke dauraan ve bebaaki se poochhate hai, ''aapane sultan dekhi he?
 
 
 There is a lot of nonsense in this
 " ek bhartiya pahalwaan kii jindagi par bani salmaan kii film, jo box offis par record tod rahi he, ko khaarij karte hue yogeshwar kehete hai, ''aap belon se khet jotikar yaa eenton ke boj ke saath sidhiruaan chadhakar aadhunik olympic kii taiyaari nahin kar sakate
 You have to understand the needs and demands of today's game
 1940 ke dashak ke ye nuskhe ab kisi kaam ke nahin
 "for instance, Yogeshwar Dutt practices in a hypoxic chamber separated from his rural background in order to increase capacity in which heights of up to 3,200 meters can be detected and trained
 2013 main yogeshwar ko kaaphi chot lagi thi, phir 2015 main bhi unhen kai baar chot lagi
 He has once again achieved the same physical strength by alternating cardio and weight-based training of his trainers
 choton ke isi daur main jab unki fitness par andeh hone laga tha, unhone 2014 main inchion asian khelon main swarna padak jitkar olympic khelon main padak jeetne kii ukvamido ko phir se pankh laga die hai
 Says Yogeshwar, "when i won a bronze medal in London, i was upset
" maano kuch nahin hua
 Something was missing
 log aae or mujhe badhaaiyaan deen or maine medal dikhaaya
 But all was meaningless for me
 koi nahin jaanata ki rio main kya hoga, lekin main hameshaa sona hi jeetna chahta hum
 "yogeshwar's phone rings during a training session at the Sonepat wrestling hall named after Yogeshwar and two Olympic medalists, Sushil Kumar, who recites the rhyme of Veer Rasa
 yogeshwar kii ginahen baar-baar diwaar par tangi us yaadgaar tasviir kii ore jaati he jisamen ve landan olympic main podium par khadey padak ko chuum rahe hai
 At present, there is so much swelling above his right eye that the eye is not visible
 yogeshwar kehete hai, ''mat par jaise hi aap apane pratidwandvi kii ankhon main ankhen daalate hai, aapako turant pataa chal jaataa he ki aap usase jeet sakate hai yaa nahin
 "coming out of his thoughts, he says," i want the opponent to see this time and understand that i have come to win

 In civilized language, Digvijay Singh can be said to be unbridled
 haal hi main unhone apana kuch isi tarah kaa chitra khinchaa tha
 This comment is worrying about the future of the country's oldest political party, considering that he is one of the most powerful general secretaries of the Congress and more importantly, he is the chief advisor to Rahul Gandhi
 digvijay haal hi main ujjain main unka virodh kar rahe bhaajapa ke yuva kaaryakartaaon se hathapayee par utar aae
 a BJP worker claims that Digvijay slapped him
 par ve iskaa khandan karte hai
 His quick response was, "I am not weak
 '' baad main jab ve thodaa shant hue to unhone kaha, ''maine kisi ko thappad maaraa, in khabaron me koi sachaai nahin he
 If i had slapped someone, i would have accepted
 ''is thappad kii gunj tivi channelon par sunai detii rahi
 The satirists mocked Digvijay, calling him the new attack dog of the Congress

 That dog
 
 
 digvijay ne kaat khaaya tha
 "so has the level of Digvijay's politics fallen so far?" They are unrestrained
 zyada puraani baat nahin he jab unhone india today ko kaha tha, ''main jamini kaaryakarta hum
 We are all Congress workers, not top leaders
 '' party kii madhya pradesh ikai main unke samarthak unki harkaton ko uchit tehraane kii bharpoor koshishen kar rahe hai
 Congress leader Ajay Singh said in the state assembly that stones were thrown at Digvijay's convoy in Ujjain
 digvijay ne mumbai main haal hi main hue bam visphoton ko sampradayik rang dene or unase rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa naam jodne kaa prayaas kiya to bhaajapa ne virodh kiya
 Digvijay told the media that he was misunderstood
 unka kahana tha, ''mumbai bam visphoton ke silsile main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main maine kaha ki jaanch hone dijie
 No possibility can be ruled out
 bam banane main sanghee tatv pehle bhi shaamil rahe hai
 "the Congress headquarters in Delhi kept away from Digvijay's comments and just said," Ask him only
 '' televijan par hui bahes main koi congressi netaa unke bachaav main nahin aayaa
 But the reason behind this was more sly tactics than embarrassment
 doharaa rukh apnaanaa party ke liye suvidhajanak he
 Had the party been a little uneasy with Digvijay's antics, his speech would have been stopped long ago
 digvijay kii dussahaspurn tippaniyan yaa phir diggiliks, jaise aajkal unhen kaha jaataa he, congress party kii chirparichit vot bank raajnneeti ke lihaaj se manamafik he
 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad calls them 'his masters' and says that Digvijay is "speaking the dialect of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi"
 '' unki ajibo-garib tippaniyon kii kisi ne kabhi aalochana nahin kii
 This is the reason why party spokespersons are also afraid to refute their point
 aatankwaadi hamalon main aresas kii bhoomika kaa aarope lagaakar digvijay uttar pradesh main muslim vot bank ko khush kar rahe hai
 The BJP has polarized votes by replacing Uma Bharti in the state
 muslim samudaay unke naam ko babari masjid vidhwans se jodakar dekhtaa he
 Digvijay wants to bring these votes to the Congress
 or lagata he ki is kaam main ve safal bhi ho rahe hai kyonki in dinon bhaajapa kii ek aantarik report kii charchaa joro par he jiske mutabik rajya ke musalamaanon ke saath judane main ve safal rahe hai
 Digvijay's deep-rooted admiration is reflected in this tough and time-bound politics compared to its leaders who are active in air-conditioned TV studios even within the BJP
 kattar sadhvi rutambhraa ke saath manch saajha karne vaale baba ramdev ke khilaaf digvijay ke kade tevar hon yaa phir aatankwaadiyon ke maamalon kii fast treks court main sunwaayee kii unki maang ho, digvijay ne muslim samudaay ke ek varg ko aakarshith kiya he, jo congress kii madhyamargi ranneeti se darkinar mahasoos karata tha
 "he has emerged as the messiah of Muslims," says Abdus Salam, a former Congress MLA from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh
 musalamaanon ke pichde varg main unke jaisaa kad kisi or kaa nahin he
 Till now, militant used to mean Muslim only
 ve akele aise netaa hai jo sambhaavna jataa rahe hai ki aatank ke peeche hindu sanghathan (aresas) kaa haath bhi ho saktaa he
 "but Digvijay should know that conspiracy theories do not turn into votes
" netaa badalte hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress lacks the ground leader
 digvijay bhavanaaen bhadakaane kii chaahe jitani bhi koshishen kyon na kar len, lekin isse uttar pradesh congress main netritv kii kami ko chipaaya nahin ja saktaa
 Digvijay's plan goes far beyond the 2012 elections in Uttar Pradesh
 unki najar 2014 par he
 While the BJP has not yet been able to unite and organize itself, the optimistic Congress hopes that it will once again emerge as the single largest party
 satark rahul yah tay nahin kar paae hai ki aise paridrishy main ve pradhanmantri banenge yaa phir sonia-manmohan model barkaraar rakhenge, jisase kai congressi netaaon ke man main sheersh pad paane ke armaan machal rahe hai

 Digvijay is the foremost among them
 musalamaanon ko khuleam aakarshith karne kaa yah daanv pehle bhi aajamaaya ja chukaa he
 His late Guru Arjun Singh also followed this agenda
 magar arjuna singh ne babari masjid vidhwans ke baad narsingh raav mantrimandal se istipha nahin diya to muslim maton kaa samarthan kho baithe the
 But beingware of any such mistake, Digvijay is giving full importance to Muslim votes
 'gauravshaalee raja' se jamini ladaaka bananaa aasaan he, par iske ulat hona mushkil he
 This is the advantage of being unbridled - only then they have become proficient Togadia of Muslims

 But if Modi had to pay attention, what was the last 10 years less? Be it Muslims from Godhra or from any corner of the country, they start to see the same image of Modi before Vikas Purush's image, which the Gujarat riots have no regrets about

 You may read the message of lacquer Hindi literature, but the way books are being published in large numbers and they are also getting readers to an extent, it seems that the current era is not golden age in terms of publishing and marketing of Hindi books
 Even so, the silver age is definitely there
 isi kadi main lekhak kushal singh kii upanyasika he, launde sher hote hai
 The titles of books and stories are such that these days you are easily attracted and ready for window shopping of books
 aisa lagata he ki halki hindi padhane ke shaukeen naujavaanon ke liye hi yah upanyasika kushal singh ne likhi he
 Kushal Singh is originally from Allahabad (now Prayagraj) and studied engineering upon graduation
 kushal singh kii samyata sirf ejineering tak hi chetan bhagat ke saath nahin he, iske baad unne prabandhan main para-snaatak yani emb bhi kiya he
 Not surprisingly, Kushal Singh, who works in marketing in Coal India, has taken special care of the market with great skill, from the title of the book, to deciding the content of the book
 or yahaan bhi chetan bhagat ke saath unki khaas samyata barkaraar rakhti he
 In fact, in this era, when many newcomers in Hindi literature are looking to become Chetan Bhagat of Hindi, Kushal Singh also makes a strong claim to this chair
 khaskar, jis hisaab unki yah kitaab bik rahi he usase to yahi lagata he
 In the preface of this novel, Kushal Singh makes it clear, which is also very close to the recent trend, that there is no literature in the stories described in this novel
 yah vinamrata he yaa pathakon ke liye chetavanee, yah to kushal khud hi bataa paaenge
 But he also makes it clear in the next line that there is no discussion in this novel
 iskaa ek arth yah bhi pakadie ki padhate vakt aapako khalis kisse hi pesh kiye jaaenge
 He writes, there are many such grief in the world, so i have made light moments of laughter for you
 prastaavna is baat or ummid ke saath khatm hoti he ki shaayad pathakon ke andar laundai bachi rahi hogi
 The book's blurb says: What will happen when boys start slipping on the footsteps of love while worrying about career? What will happen when they go to spend the night in the fort of Bhangarh despite fear? What happens when an unplanned road trip becomes a disaster? What happens when boyhood catches up with the Criminals? 'laundries are lions' is the story of five friends who are tough dudes, not cool dudes
 ye un logon kii kahani he jo class se lekar jindagi kii har bench par peeche hi baith pate hai
 This is not his love, not his struggle, but the story of his adventures in which he often gets entangled even when he does not want to
 ye kitaab aapako aapke laundai ke dinon kii yaad dilaaegi
 Every page of it will take you to a fun journey by tickling, twitching
 sawaal yahi he ki paanch sakht laundo (yah shabd aajkal kaaphi chalan main he, khaskar standap comidian jakir khan ke video popular hone ke baad se) kii is kahani main kissagoi kitni he or unke ladakpan kii kahaniyon se aap khud ko kitna conect kar pate hai
 If you read this book in order to cut the time while traveling in the train, then the time will be fine
 lekin saavdhaan, isamen sahitya ke moti na khojiega
 Baazdafa, in this novel, the story becomes like b grade films and its ending is equally dramatic
 aisa lagata he ki lekhak kahani ko bas khatm karne kii firaaq main he
 But Kushal Singh has started, then he should be welcome in the Hindi world
 yah unki pehali kitaab he
 It will be interesting to see whether in his next book Kushal Singh overpresents his cinematic drama or tries to acquire literary skills in literature

 First Venkaiah Naidu made a statement in the Lok Sabha on Monday and then Niranjan Jyoti regretted his statement outside the House, but now the opposition is taking the same apology as a confession of the crime, saying that when If the crime is confessed, punishment should also be announced
 teen din se sansad main sarkaar ko vipaksh ke hangaame kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 Meanwhile, the opposition did not directly accuse the speaker of working under the pressure of the government, but complained about injustice and lack of voice
 shuukravaar ko nazar bich kaa koi rasta nikaalane par rahegi, lekin itnaa tay he ki baithe-bithaae mili mudde ko vipaksh itani aasaani se jane nahin degaa, or sarkaar ko adhik se adhik jhukaana chahega

 desh kii rajdhani main bhi logon ko cash kii killat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 At some places people are complaining that they are having to visit many atms for cash
 haalanki dilli main sthiti itani kharaab nahin he jitani ki kuch or rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main dekhi ja rahi he
 The India Today team visited several places in Delhi to inspect the ATM
 maukey par dekhne ko mila ki privet bainkon kii tulana main sarkari kshetra ke bainkon ko cash kii killat se adhik jujhna pad rahaa tha
 Cash was coming out of most atms in Connaught Place, Delhi's heart
 sirfpunjab neshnal bankke atm par hi logon ko cash nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 The shutters of two PNB atms were down, while the 'out of Order' board was hanging outside an ATM
 haalanki euko, karnataka bank or esbiai ke atm kaam karte dikhe
 Some people were in a hurry to withdraw cash from the ATM in the morning for fear of queuing
 aise kuch logon se india today ne baat kii
 One such person told that i wanted to withdraw 5000 rupees, but here only notes were coming out in even number
 mujhe do-do hajaar ke do note hi mili
 a professional coming from East Delhi to Central Delhi for work every day said that i was able to withdraw money from an ATM here in Connaught Place, but many atms in East Delhi were not working
 mere kai doston ko dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 2000,500 and 100 rupee notes were being issued at ICICI Bank branch
 haalanki bank adhikariyon ne desh main kuch jagahon par mahasoos kii ja rahikash kii killatapar anbhigyata jari kii
 The SBI had an ATM at a short distance from the ICICI branch, whose shutters were dropped
 is atm main mangalvaar raat se hi cash nahin daalaa gaya tha
 Financial experts say that there are regional festivals season in many places in the country
 iske alaava sthaneey chunaav (jharkhand) he
 Cash could not reach the respective banks from RBI
 india today team dilli ke hi janpath par pahunchi to vahaan paanch atm main se sirf do hi kaam karte dikhe
 At the same time, people were seen facing the problem of lack of cash in atms in Ber Sarai, Okhla, Burari, Mayur Vihar areas of the capital
 central dilli ke bengali market main cash vaale atm kii talash main ber sarai se aae rakesh ne kaha ki hamaare kshetra main ek bhi aisa atm nahin dikhaa jahaan se paise nikaale ja saken, pichley do din se vahaan yahi haalat he
 i finally decided to come here
 mere doston ne bhi mujhe card die hai ki unke liye bhi kuch cash nikaal kar le jaaun
 One student told the India Today team, 'after two days i could withdraw the cash
 ummid karata hum ki sthiti jaldi sudharegi
 "when a manager of a public sector bank was asked about the hoarding of 2000 rupee notes, he said," As far as the 2000 notes are concerned, we often hear complaints from people
 agar atm sirf 2000 ke note nikaalata he to log branch main aakar chote mulya ke note maangate hai
 Such complaints should not come much, so now 100, 200 and 500 rupee notes are being put in atms
 ' You must have heard people say that in pregnancy, heart likes to eat pickles, tamarind and sour things
 vahiin kuch mahilaon ko deyari utpaada khaane kaa man karata he to kuch ko chocolate khaane kaa
 It is very common to have a strong desire or craving for these food items
 par kai baar garbhavastha main mahilaon ko kuch aisi chijen khaane kii ichha hone lagati he jinke bare main ham or aap soch bhi nahin sakate
 Many of these things are also non-edible and if consumed, they can prove to be dangerous
 garbhavastha ke dauraan ajeebogareeb chijen khaane kii ichha hona pika kehalaata he
 Which can also prove to be dangerous for the unborn child
 ye shabd latin shabdaawalee se liya gaya he
 Inspired by a bird called magpie, the term refers to the situation when a pregnant woman wishes to eat strange things
 darasal, magapi naam kii chidiya lagbhag sabakuch hi khaati he or usee ke aadhaar par ye shabd chunaa gaya he
 But it is not the case that only pregnant women have this problem
 chote bacchon main is samasya ko sabase zyada notice kiya gaya he
 After all, why does such a desire happen during pregnancy? a recent research has said that when a pregnant woman is deficient in iron, she starts to desire strange things
 iske alaava kuch adhyayanon main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki sharir main jin chizon kii kami hoti he sharir un kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye indriyon ko prerit karata he
 As a result, the mind is eager to eat strange things
 garbhavastha main koun-koun si ajeebogareeb chijen khaane ke liye lalachataa he man?garbhavastha main kai baar mahilaon ko mitti, disergent, cigarette kii raakh, baking soda, coffee ke beej, paint, plaster, ret, toothpaste, pathar, charcol, jali hui maachis kii tilliyaan or aisi hi duusari ajeebogareeb chijen khaane kaa man karata he
 Is there a danger to the child from the consumption of these things? None of these things is such that the child benefits from eating
 ye sabhi chijen maa or bachche donon ke liye behad khatarnaak sabit ho sakati hai
 Consumption of these poses a risk of spreading poison in the body which can harm the health of the child and the mother
 darane kii koi jarurat nahin hedgar garbhavastha ke dauraan aapako bhi kuch aisi hi chijen khaane kaa dil kar rahaa he to aapako bataa den ki ye koi asamaanyata nahin he
 This is a very common process
 haa, par aapako apane doctor ko suchit karnaa chahie
 It is better to be upset that you start taking the nutrients from the doctor's advice due to which you are getting a desire to eat these things
 agar aapako achaanak se in chizon ko khaane kaa man karne lage to khud ko duusari baton or kaamon main uljhane kii koshish karen
 If this does not happen then, using sugar free chewing gum will also work
 iske alaava aap pudine yaa tulsi kii pattiyon ko bhi chaba sakati hai
 The drug mafia is the brother-in-law of Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and Punjab Cabinet Minister Bikram Singh Majithia
 is baat kaa khulaasa drugs racket chalaane ke jurm main giraftaar kiye gaye antarrashtriya pahalwaan jagadish bholaa ne kiya he
 After this revelation of Bhola, the political atmosphere in Punjab, which is facing the harsh cold, has become very hot
 vipakshi partiyon ne majithia kaa naam is racket main aane ke baad se band or bhukh hadtaal kii ghoshnaa karte hue soobe main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii maang kar di he
 Earlier, the name of boxer Vijender Singh had also appeared in this case

 Actually in this scandal, Punjab cabinet minister Bikram Majithia is involved
 usne kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch punjab police ke bajaay sibiai kare to insaaf mil saktaa he
 Although Bikram Majithia has been given a clean chit by Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal, but the Congress has made up its mind to question the matter
 crimanal ke kehane par karrwai nahinpunjab police kii bhi haalat badal sarkaar jaisi hi he
 State DGP Sumedh Singh Saini says in the press conference in this case that we have so far arrested 51 people in this case
 ab tak 71 vaahan, 13 hathiyaar or kaaphi maatra main drugs ricover kii he
 We cannot act at the behest of any hard core criminal
 16 se chakkaa jampunjab congress ke pradhan pratap singh bajva kaa kahana he ki is cese main cabinet mantri kaa naam aane ke baad, kya aapako lagata he ki police khulkar jaanch kar sakati he
 We want a case to be registered against Majithia by resigning
 iske saath hi maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karai jaae
 And if it does not happen, we will jam Chakka in Punjab on 16 January
 iske saath hi 21 se ham bhukh hadtaal par baithenge
 The Election Commission has once again relieved Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko bhrashtachari number van kehane par congress ne chunaav ayog main shikaayat kii thi
 Now the Commission has said on this complaint that prima facie we do not see any violation in this matter
 lihaaja ye cese band kiya jaataa he
 That is, in this case too, he is expected to get a clean chit from the Election Commission
 isse pehle bhi chunaav ayog se piem modi kii kai baar shikaayat kii gai thi
 Each time he received a clean chit from the commission
 vipakshi dalon ne lagaataar piem modi ko clin chit milane par sawaal bhi uthaaya tha
 Meanwhile, the opposition has got another chance with another clean chit
 khaas baat ye he ki ab tak piem modi ke khilaaf unke bayanon par congress utani hamalavar nahin rahi, jitani ki rajeev gandhi ko bhrashtachari kehane par hui thi
 Today, Priyanka Gandhi also attacked Modi's statement sharply
 isse pehle gujarat ke patan main 21 april ko die bhaashan par vipaksh ne aapatti jataai thi
 On the report of the District Election Officer and the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, the Commission did not see any flaw in this speech of Prime Minister Modi
 vipakshi dal congress ne ab tak piem modi or amit shah ke khilaaf aachaar samhita ulanghan kii 11 shikaayatein darj karai thim
 If the Commission kept ignoring him, the Congress requested the Supreme Court that Hazur, you should do something
 ayog to sunata hi nahin
 After this, the court rebuked the Commission as to why the Commission was not exercising its powers
 The court asked to settle all complaints of violation of the code of conduct lodged against modi-shah by Monday
 iske baad ayog ne shikayaton par apni kundali dhili kii or danaadan farmaan aane lage
 Clean chit in everything! In the last seven complaints, the report was sent by the local election administration, despite the evidence of opposition complaints and video recordings of speeches, the Commission did not find any merit
 isi dauraan ek or khabar ai ki chunaav ayog main piem modi ko lagaataar clin chit dene main bhi ek raay nahin he
 Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi's condition is stable

 Doctors said that 62-year-old Dasmunsi's condition remained the same as that of Friday
 unke mastishk ke sanchaalan par nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 Head of the Department of Cardiovascular Diseases VK Bahl said that whether he is out of danger or not, it can only be said that his brain will start functioning properly
 unhone kaha ki ham unke mastishk kii sthiti par najadik se najar rakhe hue hai

 'why there were no reports in this case till last year the rule was that if you have more than one residential house, then you had to pay tax for the potential rental income

 padosiyon kii shikaayat ke baavjood jo dilli police apane saathi kii ashleelata par ankhen munde baithi thi, usee police ne aaj tak main khabar dikhaae jane ke baad naa sirf apane is saanwariyaa ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kar liya, balki fouran use suspend kar jail main bhi daal diya
 For the last two months, these men were playing this game of bareness every day with complete restriction
 janaab suraj ugte hi apane ghar se baahar nikalate or sabase pehle padosi ke darvaaze par peshaab karte or isi ke saath shuru ho jaataa inke nangepan kaa wo khel, jise dekh kar puraa mohalla shame se pani-pani ho jaataa
 Brother used to wrap his towel around the house for hours on the pretext of cleanliness and in the meantime he would take off his towel after seeing what passed through there
 ab sochie, un logon kii haalat kya hoti hogi, jinhen subah-subah aisa ajeebogareeb manjar dekhne ko miltaa
 While most of their neighbors had stopped coming out of their house in shame, the people passing through this place would have accelerated their move by seeing this bare maestro
 haar kar logon ne nangepan ke is khilaadi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye police se shikaayat kii, lekin apane hi mahakme ke ek member yani consteble jayadev singh malik ke is khel ko police ne nazarandhaaz kar diya lekin malik kii besharmi se ub kar inke ek padosi ne jahaan sisitivi camere main inaki tasviren kaid kar lee, vahiin aaj tak ne nangepan ke is khel ke khilaaf logon kaa saath dene ke faisla kiya
 In the incident on Saturday, the masked off the face of this policeman who used to throw a towel on the matter and on the other hand, the department measured his own meeting
 pehle janaab suspend hue or phir giraftaar kar liye gaye
 The police had earlier registered a case against this constable under light sections, but after the efforts till date, the same police registered a non-bailable case against him under serious sections as well as new law POSCO
 ab giraftaar ke baad janaab ke sir se har rose subah-subah tauliya utaarne kaa bhoot to utar hi ho gaya hoga
 It remains to be seen how and when the police can get their accused punished in the court of law
 ye kisi sanak he? ye kaisaa paagalpan he? akhir dilli police kaa consteble jayadev singh malik rose subah tauliya utaar kar sadak par nanga kyon khadaa ho jaataa he? dilli police kaa ye saanwariyaa akhir kyon itnaa ashleel he? jawaab janenge, to chaunk jaaenge
 Date: 03 May 2013 Time: 06:30 in the morning, Jaidev Singh Malik, constable of Delhi Police, comes out of his house early in the morning and at this time there is nothing more than a towel on his body
 ittefaq se tabhi pados main rahanevaale ek bujurg shaks bhi apane ghar se baahar nikalate hai or malik apana tauliya khol kar besharmi se bujurg ke saamne khadaa ho jaataa he lekin kehete hai naa jab samnevaala insaan nangepan par utar aae, to shame khud ko kerani padati he
 So, elderly people think it is right to go out in front of Malik but this is not a one day thing, but for the last almost two months Malik has been doing such activities without leaving Naga everyday outside his house
 taarikh: 15 may 2013subah: subah 03 bajkar 52 mintelik ke pados main rahanevaale bujurg satpal rose subah apane ghar se tahalne ke liye nikalate hai or is rose malik unke ghar se baahar nikalne se pehle thik unke ghar ke baahar hi peshaab kar rahaa he
 Two days later, Malik's attitude remains the same
 pehle wo apane padosi ke ghar ke darvaaze par peshaab karata he or phir ashleel harakat
 Date: May 22, 2013 Time: 06 o'clock in the morning Malik opens his towel as soon as he gets out of the house in the morning and then his vulgar acts begin
 hameshaa kii tarah malik aaj bhi mahaz ek tauliye main ghar ke baahar maujuud he or tabhi pados ke makaan main ek ladkaa aata he or use aate dekh kar malik ek baar phir vahi harakat karata he or yani tauliya khol kar uske saamne khadaa ho jaataa he
 Date: May 28, 2013 Time: 6 o'clock in the morning, but this day, like all limits are over
 pehle to bike kii saafe-safaai ke bahaane tauliya pahana malik apni tauliya kholta he or bhi padosiyon ke saamne hi ashleel harakat shuru kar detaa he
 Slowly the time passes and the movement of people starts on the road, but the movements of this Delhi Police constable continue and Malik goes as far as he can when he sees the antics on the balcony He again starts gesturing by taking off his towel
 police consteble malik kii in harkaton kaa asar ye tha ki yahaan se guzaranevaale log jahaan subah-subah ise sadak par dekh kar apana munh duusari ore kar tezi se nikal bhaagate the, vahiin kai dafaa ye bacchon ke saamne bhi aisi harakat karne se baj nahin aata or to or jab iske padosi ke ghar main doodhwaala aata, to ye rozaana use bhi apana jism zarur dikhaata lekin jab malik kii harkaton se aaziz aakar uske padosiyon ne uske khilaaf report likhavai, to auraten bhi apni pareshaani bataae bagaiyr nahin rah saki
 By the way, you are probably thinking that the people around you may have been silent till now due to fear of Malik being in the police, but it is also a surprise that Malik is the neighbor from whom he can commit such acts to get rid of his girlfriends It was, he himself was once in the Delhi Police and his son is still working as a sub-inspector but the condition was that the police also did not complain to the people of the department against the visit of their own department
 In was listening
 jaahir he ab aap soch rahe honge ki akhir malik aisa karata kyon tha? to iskaa jawaab bhi dilli police ke hi ritred sab inspector ke paas maujuud hai
 If they believe, they have been having an old dispute with Malik over property, but now Malik had come down on such fallen antics
 lekin dekhie apni ochhi harkaton ke saath sisitivi camere main kaid hone ke baad jayadev malik kisi bechaargi bhari surat bana kar ise apane khilaaf ek saazish qaraar de rahaa tha
 On the other hand, Jaydev Malik, who was on hooliganism and nakedness near his house, was describing himself as a victim of his own neighbor's oppression
 baharhaal, sisitivi tasveeron main malik kii harkaton ko dekhne ke baad ab kisi ke liye bhi ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki sach koun bol rahaa he or jhooth koun? vaise pehle police ne ye sabakuch dekhne ke baavjood malik ke khilaaf halki or jamaanti dhaaraon ke tahat maamla darj kiya tha, lekin aaj tak kii koshish ke baad police ne malik ke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti dhaaraon ke saath-saath privansion of child fram sexual offenses yani posco ke tahat bhi maamla darj kar use giraftaar kar liya he
 Well, seeing the antics of Delhi Police Constable Jaidev Singh Malik, one can also remember the title track of Ranbir Kapoor's film Saawariya

 magh maas main krishna paksh ekadshi ko shatatila ekadshi manaai jaati he
 This time is Shattila Ekadashi on Thursday 31 January
 guuruuvaar or ekadshi vishnu bhagwaan kaa din mana jaataa he
 It is believed that by following Lord Vishnu on this day money is benefited
 is din vishnu ke avatar ke rup main krishna ji kii bhi puja hoti he
 It is also believed that using sesame seeds provides knowledge and wealth on this day
 kaha jaataa he til main maha lakshmi kaa vaas hota he, isliye bacchon kii padhai, gyaan or dhan main laabh hota he
 How to use and worship sesame seeds in Shattila Ekadashi - Take a bath or wash your mouth by adding black sesame and Ganges water
 - agar sambhav ho to ekadshi kaa vrath rakhen
 - Wear white clothes
 - fal phool or gud, til kii mithai se vishnu dev or krishna ji kii puja karen
 - Havan with black sesame
 - puja kaa mantra jaap or havan kaa mantra hoga- namo bhagavate vasudevy- is mantra kaa 108 baar jaap karen

 The story of Shatatila Ekadashi - It is said that a woman used to do a lot of worship, penance
 bhagwaan us mahila se prasann ho gaye or rup badalakar, bhikhaari ke rup main us mahila se bhagwaan ne daan maanga
 The woman got angry and put a stone in the character of God
 us mahila ko tapasya se aalishaan makaan or sukh suvidhaayen to mil gayi, lekin khaane kii koi vyavastha nahin hui
 What would a woman of such a luxurious house do, in which there is nothing to eat
 usne phir bhagwaan ko prarthana kar ke bulaayaa or uskaa kaaran poocha
 It is believed that the Lord told him that unless after doing rigorous penance, he does not get the full benefit of penance unless he donates something
 khaskar shatatila ekadshi kaa vrath kar ke til or til kii mithai kaa daan karnaa chahie
 Hearing these things of God, the woman fasted on Shatila Ekadashi and donated sesame sweets
 iske baad use aalishaan mahal main khaane pine kaa saamaan uplabdh ho paaya

 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that the international terrorist Osama bin Laden was killed in the actions of US special forces, not the martyr of the Muslims, as the martyrs are trying to tell him
 neshnal conference aaf edetorial riters ko sambodhit karte hue hillari ne kaha ki videsh vibhaag ab is mudde par kaam kar rahaa he ki ‘logon ko sahamat kiya jaae ki vah ek hatyara tha, shahid nahin ‘or bin laden ne kisi or ke mukaable musalamaanon kii sabase adhik hatyaein kin
 Hillary said, he was the destroyer of Muslims
 ’ unhone is baat ko rekhaankit kiya ki laden kaa duniya ke vibhinn hisson main kai prabhaavshaalee logon par jabardast asar tha or america ko pehle hi is prakaar ke prayaas najar aa rahe hai ki al kaayda nae netaa kaa faisla karegaa
 Hillary said, the successor crisis provides an opportunity
 bahut se log kehete he ki al jawahiri uski jagah legaa
 But it is not entirely clear
 uski utani vafadari yaa prerana yaa shandaar itihaas nahin he
 Hillary said in hopes, "so i think his death, his withdrawal from leadership is very important and two other things also need to be remembered that after President Bush's 9 / 11 attacks, when Al Qaeda from the Taliban Mullah Omar had a personal relationship with bin Laden if he had asked to leave with Ka
 isliye is ghatana ne taliban se nipatane kii aisi sambhaavnaaon kaa maarg kholaa he jo pehle nahin thim
 The Foreign Minister said that with the death of bin Laden, efforts to stop al Qaeda and its terrorist system will not end
 hillari ne kaha, afghanistan main, hamen al kaayda or uske taliban sahyogiyon se ladaai jari rakhni hogi
 Probably now they will take this work seriously which we are trying to do through the process of conciliation agreement to end terrorism
 kuch sawaalon ke jawaab main clinton ne kaha ki is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki al kaayda kuch had tak bikharaa he jiske abhiyaanon ke peeche laden kaa dimag tha or uski prerana kaam karti thi
 He said, 'he was a man whose loyalty people vowed when he joined al Qaeda

 ' board parikshaayen shuru ho gai hai, jiske liye students ne salbhar mehnat kii he
 However, many times students make some such mistakes on the day of board exam, which can cause problems for them and also their year-long hard work
 aise main ham aapako un galatiyon ke bare main bataa rahe hai, jo aksar log kar dete hai
 You should also know about these mistakes, so that you can avoid these mistakes
 paper achche se nahin padhate- jab bhi student board pariksha dene skool jate hai to thode nervas ho jate hai
 But even after 15 minutes given to read the paper, they do not read the paper well
 agar aap achche se pehle paper pard lete hai to aap is baat kaa faisla kar sakate hai ki aapako kaunsa sawaal pehle karnaa he or kaunsa sawaal baad main karnaa he
 Time Management - Time management is the best way to rush the paper
 students ko exam main time management karke chalanaa chahie
 Often students do not run with time management and their paper is left
 jab bhi paper dene baithen to wo section jo zyada number ke hai sabase pehle unhen hal karen
 Then try to solve the section with less number
 yaa pehle un sawaalon ko nipta len, jinke liye aap puri tarah aashwast hai
 Copying wrong data - While solving numerical questions, students often write wrong numbers by looking at the question paper
 jisaki vajah se sawaal galat ho jaataa he isliye sawaal utaarte samay saavdhaanee baraten or data ek baar phir se check kar len
 Not writing the correct answer- Sometimes students write answers in big paragraphs, which makes the examiner to have trouble in checking
 jahaan tak ho sake students ko apni baat points main likhni chahie
 Give time to the answer-sheet at the end - As much as it is necessary to read the question paper in the beginning, it is necessary to read the answer sheet at the end
 paper hal karne ke chakkar aksar students ansar shit padhanaa bhul jate hai
 If you want to get good numbers in the exam, then avoid making all these mistakes

 isse pehle di accidental prime ministar samet kuch or filmon ke content ko lekar aarope lage ki inkaa makasad bijepi ko loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan phayda pahunchaana he
 Is the films creating an atmosphere in Modi's favor, a similar question was also asked to Vivek Oberoi, who is playing the role of Prime Minister in PM Narendra Modi
 darasal, india today ke liye rahul kanwal ne sawaal poocha- chunaav se pehle piem modi par film relies ho rahi he
 Isn't this a message to voters in an election environment? Vivek Oberoi said, "will the release of the film before the election affect the voters? There are so many shows running on news channels
 to kya wo chunaav ke pehle telecast hona band ho jaaenge
 "vivek Oberoi said," You cannot stray anyone by just showing a film before the election
 phir jab id par film relies hone par, christmas, diwaali par film relies hone par sawaal nahin kiye jate hai to mujhase kyon sawaal kiye ja rahe hai
 i do not understand why the Congress party is so scared
 ye film to ek prerana dene vaali he
 Anyone who watches this film will feel patriotic
 ""piem narendra modi film ek aise insaan kii kahani he jo chaay bechney ke saath aage badha
 Then after hard work, he became the PM of the country
 ye preranaaspad kahani hamane dikhaani chaahi he
 If Durga film is made on Indira Gandhi, film is made on Rajiv Gandhi then i have no problem
 "vivek ne aaropon par safai dete hue kaha, "piem modi ko film ke jariye hero nahin banaaya ja rahaa he
 He is already the hero of the country
 yah baat desh kaa har naagarik maanata he
 "why the question of Vivek is opposed to my own film? On another question related to the controversy about the film, Vivek said -" People have supported a lot of other political films released before PM Narendra Modi
 lekin ab meri film kii relies par roak lagane kii baaten ho rahi hai
 Which are wrong
 "vivek ne yah bhi kaha ki unki film ko relies hone dena chahie
 This Congress President Rahul Gandhi will also like it
 kyonki wo deshbhakt hai
 The war of words between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is growing
 mangalvaar ko modi ke khilaaf jehar ugalate hue tiemasi supremeo or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha ki agar modi pradhanmantri bane to desh jal uthegaa
 
 
 
 to jal uthegaa puraa deshisse pehle bhi tiemasi modi ke khilaaf gujarat kaa kasaai jaise tikhe shabdon kaa istemaal kar chuki he
 Mamta Banerjee said, 'india will return to the dark ages
 agar vah pradhanmantri bane to bharat jal jayega
 a person who does separatist politics cannot lead the country
 modi ko desh kaa itihaas, bhugol or raajnneeti kaa pataa nahin he
 'narendra Modi is not the only lion
 
 
 mamata ne daawa kiya ki modi ne yah maan liya he ki vah pradhanmantri ban gaye hai
 He said, 'he is not a lion alone
 mayawati, jayalalita or mulaayam ji jaise or bhi bahut se netaa hai, ve bhi sher hai
 And the most frightening lion is the Royal Bengal Tiger which is in Bengal
 'modi par he danga karaane kaa aarope
 
 
 Mamta said, 'the leader who will lead India should be like Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 aisa nahin hona chahie jisaki vicharadhara dharm ke aadhaar par desh ko vibhajit karne kii ho
 a person who is accused of rioting should not lead a multi-lingual and multi-religious country like India
 'apni jubaan par kaabo nahin rakh sakate hai modi
 
 
 One of his paintings by Modi 1
 8 karod rupee main bikne ke bare main lagaae gaye aaropon par mamata ne kaha, 'unhen koi tippanee karne se pehle tathyon kii jaanch kerani chahie
 Someone comes and says anything in their ear and they immediately spit it out
 ek vyakti jo apni jubaan par kaabo nahin kar saktaa, vah desh ko kaise kaabo main rakh paaegaa
 The West Bengal Chief Minister also accused a section of the media of dancing at corporate gestures to support Modi
 unhone kaha, 'kripaya mujhe prashasan or raajnneeti par upadesh nahin den
 ' bharat ke purv captain rahul dravid ne kaha he ki rashtriya chayankartaaon ko faisla lenaa hoga ki kharaab farm se jujh rahe virendra sahvaag se hi dakshin africa ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa main pari kii shuruyaat karai jaae yaa kisi or ko mauka diya jaae
 "I think the selectors and the management will have to decide whether to start the innings in South Africa only with Veeru or not," Dravid said
 unhone kaha, viru agar apane farm main he to kisi bhi team ke liye bahut upyogi ho saktaa he, lekin vah utana acha khel nahin paa rahaa he
 In the last two or three years, he has not done well even on the foreign tour
 unhone kaha, yadi unhen lagata he ki dakshin africa main sahvaag se pari kii shuruyaat karai jaani chahie to thik he
 In such a situation, he may be given a chance so that his confidence returns
 bharat ne bhale hi australia ko pehle do test main haraaya ho, lekin sahvaag or murali vijay ke bich saajhedaari se 11, 16 or 17 ran hi ban sake
 Vijay scored 167 runs in Hyderabad, but Sehwag was able to score just 27 runs in three innings
 tippaniyan After the remaining two Tests against Australia, India do not have to play any Test before the Test series against South Africa at the end of the year
 dravid kaa maananaa he ki kisi yuva salaami ballebaajon ko sidhe videsh main utaarne se pehle gharelu halaat main ek mauka diya ja saktaa he
 "I think another opener should be given a chance to play at least two Tests in domestic conditions before going to South Africa," he said
 dravid ne ek website se kaha, kisi yuva ballebaaj ko sidhe dakshin africa jaakar sten, philander, morkal ke saamne acha pradarshan karne ke liye kahana jyaadati hogi
 He said that the selectors should consider lowering Sehwag to the lower order
 unhone kaha, yadi ve aage kii soche to sahvaag ko madhyakram main utaara ja saktaa he
 Dravid said, Veeru can command the middle order if there is an opportunity, because he has immense experience
 masalan sachin ke sanyas lene ke baad
 This can also be an option
 dravid ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki chayankartaaon or prabandhan ko tay karnaa hoga ki ve dakshin africa main viru se hi pari kii shuruyaat karaayenge yaa nahin
 He said, Veeru can be very useful for any team if he is in his form, but he is not playing as well
 pichley do yaa teen saal main videsh daure par bhi usne acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 He said, if they feel that Sehwag should start the innings in South Africa, then it is fine
 aise main use mauka diya ja saktaa he taaki uskaa aatmavishvaas laute
 India may have beaten Australia in the first two Tests, but a partnership between Sehwag and Murali Vijay only managed 11, 16 and 17 runs
 vijay ne hyderabad main 167 ran banaaye, lekin sahvaag teen pariyon main sirf 27 ran bana sake
 The comments australia ke khilaaf baaki do test ke baad bharat ko saal ke aakhir main dakshin africa ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa se pehle koi test nahin khelnaa he
 Dravid believes that a young opener can be given a chance in domestic conditions before landing directly abroad
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki dakshin africa jane se pehle kisi duusare salaami ballebaaj ko gharelu halaat main kam se kam do test khilne kaa mauka diya janaa chahie
 Dravid told a website, it would be too much to ask a young batsman to go directly to South Africa to perform well in front of Stan, Philander, Morkel
 unhone kaha ki chayankartaaon ko sahvaag ko nichle kram par utaarne par vichaar karnaa chahie
 He said, Sehwag can be introduced in the middle order if he thinks ahead
 dravid ne kaha, kabhi mauka banegaa to viru madhyakram kii kaman sambhaal saktaa he, kyonki uske paas apaar anubhav he
 For example, after Sachin retired
 yah bhi ek vikalp ho saktaa he
 After the remaining two Tests against Australia, India do not have to play any Test before the Test series against South Africa at the end of the year
 dravid kaa maananaa he ki kisi yuva salaami ballebaajon ko sidhe videsh main utaarne se pehle gharelu halaat main ek mauka diya ja saktaa he
 "I think another opener should be given a chance to play at least two Tests in domestic conditions before going to South Africa," he said
 dravid ne ek website se kaha, kisi yuva ballebaaj ko sidhe dakshin africa jaakar sten, philander, morkal ke saamne acha pradarshan karne ke liye kahana jyaadati hogi
 He said that the selectors should consider lowering Sehwag to the lower order
 unhone kaha, yadi ve aage kii soche to sahvaag ko madhyakram main utaara ja saktaa he
 Dravid said, Veeru can command the middle order if there is an opportunity, because he has immense experience
 masalan sachin ke sanyas lene ke baad
 This can also be an option

 Some of the Indian Air Force's 80 aircraft involved in relief and rescue operations in the flood-ravaged Srinagar city suffered minor damage as they were targeted by stone pellers
 haalanki suraksha karmiyon ne kaha he ki sabhi tak madad pahunchane se pehle ve dam nahin lenge
 The rotary wing plane of the Air Force has suffered damage due to stone pelting while flying during a rescue operation in the city
 vayusena ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya, 'aisi bhi ghatnaayen hui hai, jabaki kam oonchai par ud rahe vimaan ko pattharon se nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 In fact, many stones were placed on a helicopter, causing minor damage to its exterior and petals
 ' However, the helicopter returned safely to the Air Force Center and the damage is being assessed there, the official said
 sena ne bhi bataaya ki raahat evam bachaav abhiyaanon main lagi uski naukaaon main se kuch ko patharav karne waalon ne nishaanaa banaaya
 At the same time, Air Marshal Director General Air Marshal SB Deo said, 'it is unfortunate that those who are rescuing them are being attacked
 lekin ham apana kaam nahin tyaagenge or jab tab prayek vyakti tak madad nahin pahonchegi, ham apana kaam jari rakhenge
 ' is baat kii bhi khabaren hai ki kuch jagahon par logon ko algaavvaadi uksaa rahe hai or ve sena evam vayusena dwaara kiye ja rahe raahat evam bachaav kaaryon ko baadhit kar rahe hai
 However, Dev also said that he can understand that there is anger among the people and he sympathizes with those who lost everything in the flood
 endie sarkaar kii tarah uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri or ab bijepi saansad ramesh pokharial 'nishank' ne vaidic vigyaan kii purajor vakaalat kii he
 In the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, he said that India is second to none in terms of knowledge and science and that the ancient scholar Kanad had conducted nuclear tests in the second century BC itself
 vaidic yug main bharat kii vapasinishank ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke us bayaan kaa samarthan bhi kiya jisamen unhone bhagwaan ganesh ke sir ko plastic surgery or karn ke maamle ko genetic science se joda tha
 Nishank claimed, 'people are questioning Modi ji's statement of Lord Ganesha having surgery
 vah vastav main surgery hi thi
 The science that has been available to us, the world does not have
 ek kshat-vikshat sir ko transplant karne kaa gyaan-vigyaan sirf bharat ke paas he
 At the rate of an astrologer, the Education Minister further said, "astrology is the science of calculating millions of years
 hamaare pracheen jyotishiyon ne baaki sabhi vigyaanon ko bouna kar diya he
 Astrology is the number one science in the world
 hamen vigyaan ko badhaava dena chahie
 When the left mps opposed his comment on astrology, Nishank said that it should be discussed in due course and it should get the necessary respect

 Salaman Khan's 'kick' is rocking at the box office
 box offis par film saal 2014 kii sabase badi hit sabit hui he, vahiin cinema haul ke andar fain salmaan ke geet se lekar har stant par tabadatod tali baja rahe hai
 By the way, one of the most talked about stunt scenes in the film is to leave Salman's bicycle in front of the train and cross the pedestrian in his special style
 yakeenan yah seen dilachasp he lekin cycle chhod paidal patari paar karne ke peeche ek kahani he, jise film unit ke alaava bahut kam log hi jaanate hai
 The film's director Sajid Nadiadwala gives the entire credit of this hit scene to Salman Khan
 sajid kehete hai, 'shuruyaat main hamane cycle chhodane jaisi koi baat nahin sochi thi
 Rather, the plan was that Salman would cross the track on the cycle during the chase before the moving train, but he is Salman Khan and wants to do better for the fans in every scene of his film
 'yah he asli kahani
 
 
 Sajid says, 'till the day the scene was to be shot, everything had to be done on the basis of the old plan
 yahaan tak ki shooting shuru hone se aadhe ghante tak ham sabhi taiyaari main jute the, tabhi salmaan set par apni shart ke collar ko daant main dabaakar baith gaye
 Salman's doing this means that he is thinking something
 jaahir he film kaa lead hero shooting se thik pehle aisa kuch kare to nirdeshak ke liye pareshaani bad jaati he
 It was the same with me, but it is Salman Khan who is my best friend more than an actor
 '
 
 
 And Sajid Nadiadwala, who made his directorial debut with the super hit idea 'kik', says that 10 minutes before the shooting starts, Salman gave us the idea that if he leaves the bicycle in front of the train and crosses the track then the scene will be better
 
 salmaan kaa angel yah tha ki yah alag hatke hoga or hero kii 'larger dain life' image par bhi feet baithegaa
 According to Sajid, he and the rest of the comrades did not take Salaman's idea seriously in the beginning, but decided that he would shoot the scene both in the new and the old style and then the better would be pursued
 sajid kehete hai, 'jaise hi salmaan ne cycle chhod paidal patari paar kii or seen cat hua, puraa set taaliyon se gunj uthaa
 The scene really made it so much better that we did not have to carry the old plan

 Your bank account gets cleared by paying doctors' fees, but you don't get relief

 This causes oxygen-rich blood to circulate properly in your body and does not cause swelling in the legs
 anidra ko control karen-neend na aane kii beemaari ko anidra kaha jaataa he
 It is a sleeping disorder

 But a walk on barefoot grass can help you get rid of this problem
 shaam ke vakt aapako kareeb 15 minute roj nange paanv ghaas main tahalnaa hoga
 The light of the eyes will be sharp - tell you that there is a pressure point in our feet
 ghaas par subah nange pair chalane se yah pressure point durust rahata he
 It is believed that seeing the green color of grass gives relief to the eyes
 ghaas par subah kii os ankhon ke liye bhi kaaphi phydemand hoti he
 Nervous system will be correct - Walking on barefoot grass stimulates specific acupuncture points of the foot, which help stimulate our nerves, thereby improving our nervous system

 Then one day i decided let me try how it feels to ba little lighter and hence started my weight loss journey
 It wasn't easy at all bt everytime i looked at the Progress in the mirror i got the push to do more
 i had lots more energy than before and i was loving every bit of this new person i was transforming into

 Unfortunately i was criticised to no end Fr my weight bt again i never let tht get to me

 And Fr me everything was jus an achievement to reach frm where i was to where i am
 i continued on my fitness journey irrespective Bcoz fitness Fr me is a way of life now
 Along with the weight loss came a lot of stretch marks bt instead of feeling ashamed of it and trying to hide it , i believe in flaunting it 
 It makes me feel like a tigress with her stripes

 vahiin soni tivi ne is sho kaa ek promo video share kiya he
 Dead people never speak, but now it is not so
 unki haath kii likhi khudakushi kii chitthee bahut kuch bataa jaaya karti thi
 But today, Assistant Professor in the Department of Forensic Medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AQUAS), Drs
 chittaranjan behara ke mutabik, unhen har maheene milane vaali 20-30 khudakushi kii chitthiyon main zyaadaatar i-suicide note hi hote hai, chaahe ye esemes hon yaa whats ap massej, mobile par video recording yaa phir i-mail
 So, once upon a time, forensic experts like Behera used to tell from the pressure and inclination of the tip of the pen how the mind condition of the death would have been or whether he would have taken such a step under some pressure or whether he would take his death sentence
 Was lying down while writing, etc
 lekin ab vigyaan text massej ke tareekon or keyboard kii aakhri “kii” par ungaliyon ke chhap kaa vishleshan karne kii ore mud rahaa he
 But this does not reveal the mental state of the person who died
 balki ab to kisi ko jaanane-samajhane kaa mauka bhi jaataa rahaa
 And now the obstacles of technology block the way and our fingers are less able to give an idea of our mental condition
 vajah yah he ki takanic se hamaari ungliyaan kii board par robot kii tarah chalati hai, jabaki kalam or pencil se kaagaj par ubhartee golaaiyaan dimag main chal rahe vichaaron kii prakruti kaa andaja de jaati hai
 According to Ramesh Iyer, handwriting also expresses emotion, while the brain on the keyboard leaves no impression except identifying and pressing the "key"
 ayyar kaa enjio rhite riting kerala, maharashtra or karnataka main sarkari skulon ke hajaaron bacchon ko prashikshit kar chukaa he
 This year, he aims to conduct workshops
 usne taaja abhiyaan main is saal july main maharashtra ke palghar main 150 bacchon kii haath kii likhaawat sudhaarney kaa kaarykram chalaaya
 Iyer prepared a 20-hour module for Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan to practice handwriting in Chalai, Thiruvananthapuram
 darasal, yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki sarkari skulon main computer ke kaaryakramon par jor dene se kai bachche keyboard par aksharon ko pahchaanana bhul gaye hai, kyonki unke liye likhane kaa kaam or anjayas teji se kam hota ja rahaa he
 Iyer's life is aimed at improving the handwriting of underprivileged children through government programs, but according to him, most of the phone calls come from children from various professional courses like law
 ve kehete hai, “chaatro ko haath se likhane kii jarurat ab bas parikshaon main hi padati he
 Throughout the year, they work by photocopying or photographing the notes
 is vajah se unke haath kii mansapeshiyaan parikshaon main utani teji se nahin chalatin, is vajah se ve hamaare paas madad ke liye aate hai
 In fact, the writing spoilage starts in childhood
 yah khatarnaak bhi he
 Handwriting is deteriorating to such an extent that in January this year, the Medical Council of India has instructed the State Medical Councils to create a prescription format for doctors to write in capital letters and make it mandatory from April, so that The problems that patients face due to unsightly handwriting by doctors can be overcome
 yah pahal kai logon kii ore se is bare main chintaa jaahir karne se hui he
 Last year Union Health Minister J
 pi
 Nadda has expressed concern over the type of handwriting in the prescription of doctors in Parliament
 manipal ke kasturba medical college ke forensik medicine vibhaag ke pratik rastogi or saamudayik aushadhi ke animesh jain ne indian jarnal of medical athiks main 2009 main likhaa ki aushadhiyon ke bare main galtiyaan abujh likhaawat or laaparvaahiyon ke kaaran hoti hai
 In 2006, the American National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine found that around 7,000 deaths occur each year worldwide due to poor handwriting by doctors
 ab to bachche chaar-paanch saal kii umr se hi likhnaa-padhuya shuru karne ke kahin pehle, tach screen ke mobile phone or tablet par haath chalaane lagate hai
 Because of this, it is becoming increasingly difficult for nursery school teachers to hold pen-pencils in their hands and write them on paper
 bacchon ke abhibhavakon, jaise mumbai main nau saal kii tista ke pita shantnu bhattacharya yaa nilgiri main teen schuli bacchon kii maa kaveri ahuja vagairah ne apane bacchon kii likhaawat ko behatar banane ke liye vishesh likhaawat kakshaen shuru kar di hai
 Children do not like to copy the book anymore, nor do they need to do so, so the practice of writing is becoming less
 bhattacharya kehete hai, “abhyaas chhootane se likhane main kami or kharabi aa rahi he
 But what can i do except worry? " Ahuja believes that good writing also brings good upbringing
 kya vaaki iskaa itnaa hi mahatv he? america main to public skulon main sundar aksharon kii likhaawat kab kii chhod di gai he
 There, under the initiative called Common Core State Stads, the emphasis is on teaching keyboard to children only after kindergarten
 lekin 2012 main america ke texas main indiana uniwarsity ke carin james or uniwarsity of austin kii laura angelheart ne patrika elsevier main likhaa ki yah bhul ho sakati he
 He showed in his study that due to different handwriting, the brain knows that it does not change the original meaning of the letters
 yani chaahe jaisi likhaawat main “e” likhaa jaae, vah “e” hi rahata he
 Brain activism in open-handed writing may be faster than those writing on the computer
 tantrika vigyaan (neurology) ke kshetra main haath kii likhaawat ke tareeke se andaja lagaaya jaataa he
 According to Ashok Jammi of the Gurunanak Institute of Technology in Hyderabad, now at Hawasa University in Ethiopia, the research looks at the relationship between the patient's handwriting and the amount of neurological disease or its symptoms
 is shodh main tablet main online or kalam se ofline, donon likhaawaton kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 Researchers found, "handwriting requires maximum control over the muscles, so the shortcomings in handwriting indicate a state of nervous disease
 ”alzimer or parkinson rog kii pahchaan main bhi haath kii likhaawat kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Now it is also being used in other diseases like apraxia and abolia
 apraxia tantrikaon ke kamjor hone se judi samasya he to ebulia nirnaayak karrwai karne main dikkat kii beemaari he
 Research is underway on the treatment of teaching Hindustani classical music to the students who are weak in learning at Patina International Inclusive School in Hyderabad
 visheshgy shikshak rajesh ramchandran or anuraagini singh ne paaya he ki likhaawat sudhaarney ke liye sangeet ke istemaal se uccharan, hijje or vaakyon ke bich main antar kaa gyaan paaya ja saktaa he
 Now it is being researched that what we miss by writing by hand
 mathew battles kii nai kitaab palimpcest main yah dikhaaya gaya ki likhe gaye shabd se hamaara rishta kya he or likhnaa kaise hamen zyada jeevant or sakriy banaae rakhata he
 For example, writing with idioms and interesting writing cannot be like Twitter
 unke mutabik, aadmi kii bolchaal kii kala se pehle likhane kii kala ke darshan pompi (italy main neples ke paas pracheen shahar) main hote hai
 They also state that the formality of writing also comes in colloquial and from time to time, proverbs are made from it
 harvard bijness rivyuu ke taaja ank main megi macgloin kahati hai ki jo log laptop main note lete hai, unase zyada nai suchanaaen kaagaj-kalam se note lene waalon ko milti hai
 She cites Pam Muller of Princeton University and Daniel Openheimer of the University of California at Los Angeles
 macgloin typing ko bedimag likhaawat maanati hai, jis ore samaaj badhata ja rahaa he
 Sandeep Dang and Mahesh Kumar of the Sri Siddhivinayak Educational Group of Institutions, Bilaspur, in the International Journal of Advanced Research and Computer Science and Software Engineering in 2014 have told that no matter how much science and technology can progress, modern computation methods are such Could not extract the formulas from which it can be told in which man is capable
 baharhaal, jab tak computer maanav dimag kaa koi model nahin bana letaa, tab tak keval haath kii likhaawat hi he jo yah pataa laga sakati he ki koun-sa vyakti kitna kaabil he

 Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi, is a small-time farmer and the policy of the Haryana government has been that small farmers should get the benefit of development and urban projects
 ye maasoom sa bayaan he haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda kaa

 In this sequence, if a farmer makes a profit by selling his license and land to the builder, then what is wrong with it
 ’ gauratlab he ki wadra ne yahi kiya
 He bought the land as a farmer and then obtained a license thereon and sold the land to DLF at a profit of crores
 is sawaal par ki kya aap wadra ko haryana kaa ek garib kisaan kah rahe hai, hooda bole ki ‘wadra bhoomi ke maalik hai
 If the land they own is agricultural land, then they become farmers
 ghisa pita raag alaapte hue hooda ne kaha ki is 3
 There is so much controversy over 53 acres of land because Vadra is the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi
 wadra ne jo bhi deal kii, vah katai gaiyrkanoonee nahin he

 He also said that Khemka is forcibly trying to make one thing an issue
 vah jo aarope laga rahe hai, chif secetry unase is par jawaab maang chuke hai

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the turnout of leaders and actors or the entry into politics continues
 lambey samay tak samaajawaadee party se judi raheen mashhoor film abhinetri jayaprada ab bhartiya janata party main shaamil ho gai hai
 After Jaya Prada joined BJP, he can now get party ticket from Rampur
 jayaprada rampur loksabhaa seat se 2004 or 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jeet hasil kar chuki hai
 BJP has got a candidate from this Muslim majority parliamentary constituency which can give a tough challenge to the Congress besides the SP-BSP alliance here
 jayaprada apane dhai dashak ke raajnneetik kariyar main kai party badal chuki hai
 Jaya, who was a two-time MP from Jitarampur in 2014, got into a heated battle with sp's veteran leader Azam Khan and the two came face to face
 is bich 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle march main jayaprada apane raajnneetik dost amar singh ke saath rashtriya lokdal (areldi) main shaamil ho gayi or unhen unki nai party ne bijanour se tikat diya, lekin unhen 'modi lahar' main karaari haar mili
 However, changing the party for Jayaprada is not the first time
 bijepi unki chauthi party he jisamen vah shaamil hui hai
 She started her political career by joining the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in 1994 and remained in this party for nearly a decade
 lekin is bich tidipi sansthaapak anti ramarao ke biimaar hone ke baad jab party ke kai bade netaa chandrababu naidu ke saath baghawat kar gaye to jaya bhi unke saath thim
 The pair did not fare well with Chandrababu Naidu as well and before the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, they decided to join the Samajwadi Party and managed to win the Rampur Lok Sabha seat in the same year
 2004 ke chunaav main unhone 85 hajaar maton ke antar se jeet hasil kii
 She then won the 2009 election with a margin of 30 thousand votes
 rampur muslim bahul kshetrarampur uttar pradesh main un loksabhaa siton main shaamil he jahaan par muslim samudaay bahusankhyak he
 More than 50 percent of the population of Rampur seat in western Uttar Pradesh region is Muslim
 is kshetra ko samaajawaadee party ke diggaj netaa ajam khan kaa garh mana jaataa he
 Although Nepal Singh of the Bharatiya Janata Party won everyone by surprise in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he got this victory in the 'modi wave'
 2014 main hue chunaav main bijepi or sapa ke bich kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mili thi
 bjp's Nepal Singh 37 in the election
 5 fisadi or samaajawaadee party ke naseer ahamed khan ko 35 fisadi vot mili the
 The difference of Nepal Singh's victory was only 23,435 votes
 nepal singh kii is apratyaashit jeet ke kaaran itihaas main pehali baar kisi loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh se ek bhi muslim saansad nahin chunaa ja sakaa
 Total 50 in Rampur as per 2011 census
 57 % muslim aabaadi he, jabaki 45
 97% of the population is Hindu
 lekin is baar badale raajnneetik sameekaran main bijepi ke liye yah seat bachaa paanaa aasaan nahin mana ja rahaa kyonki pradesh main sapa or basapa ne aapasi gathbandhan kar liya he
 In such a situation, BJP was looking for a strong leader, now Jaya Prada's entry into the party seems to be fulfilling
 rampur main tisare charan main chunavi prakriya shuru hogi or ab dekhnaa hoga ki bijepi jayaprada ko tikat detii he yaa nahin

 unhone kaha, ‘is baar nishanebaajon kii sankhya nau (beijing main) se badhkar 11 ho gai he or athens (2004 main rajyavardhan singh rathod ko rajat) tathaa beijing main padak ke baad manobal bhi badha he

 hamaara prayaas main unhen olympic main samay form main sheersh par laana he
 That matters and not what we have done in the past

 However, during the London Games, the role of dealing with pressure will also be important and in such a situation the presence of a player like Bindra will benefit the young shooters

 saujany: NEWSFLICKS Can former home minister p Chidambaram be arrested? Judge Sunil Gaur of the Delhi High Court refused to grant advance bail in the INX Media case
 unhone kaha ki jaanch agenciyon ne jo saamagree prastut kii he, uski bhayavahata or vishalata ko dekhte hue agrim zamaanat nahin di ja sakati he
 Chidambaram got relief from the High Court last year, when the court sought answers to some questions from agencies
 jis tarah se pravartan nideshaalay or sibiai dilli ke jangpura main unke ghar par dabish die baithi he usase giraftaar kii ashanka bemaani nahin lagati he
 After not getting bail from the High Court, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid and Abhishek Manu Singhvi reached the Supreme Court
 tab tak court uth chuki thi
 After that he went to the Joint Registrar, where he was asked to mentor the senior justice on Wednesday, plead
 chif justise ayodhya kii sunwaayee kar rahe hai isliye senior justise ke paas jane ke liye kaha gaya he
 Meanwhile, when the bail was not received from the Supreme Court, the first CBI team reached his house
 uske kuch der baad pravartan nideshaalay kii team pahunch gai
 Both agencies had said in court that Chidambaram's arrest was necessary
 is cese main pichley saal unke bete karti chidambaram giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai or 23 dinon tak hiraasat main the
 Then there is a strong fear that Chidambaram could be arrested anytime, although nothing has been officially said
 chidambaram apane ghar par nahin hai
 He could not be contacted
 chidambaram par hawaii jahaaj kii kharid or airsel ke maamle main bhi alag se cese hai
 Chidambaram himself and his lawyers kept saying that the Modi government continues to target him due to political opposition
 lekin sarkaar kaa paksh hameshaa is baat se inkaar karata rahaa he
 It is being said that Chidambaram was the Home Minister when Amit Shah was arrested and now that Amit Shah is the Home Minister, Chidambaram's house is being hit by two agencies
 vaise hai court ne apane faisle main raajnneetik badale kii karrwai kii baat ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki yah kahana thik nahin rahegaa
 This is a classic case of money laundering
 is cese main jab exiaar hui thi jab chidabanram kaa naam aaropee ke taur par nahin tha
 They are being investigated for their role in the unnamed officials of the ministry and in the category of the person's name
 jaanch agenciyon ne kaha ki unhone thik se jawaab nahin die isliye hiraasat jaruri he
 In February this year, the ED questioned p Chidambaram for five hours
 jaanch agenciyaan daawa karti rahi hai ki 2007 main jab chidambaram vitt mantri the tab unhone peter or indrani mukherjee kii tivi company ko manzuri dilaai jiske baad is company main kathith rup se 305 karod kaa videshi fund aayaa
 While permission was given to invest only five crores, but INX Media invested more than 300 crores
 or apane ko bachaane ke liye ienex media ne karti chidambaram ke saath saazish kii or sarkari afasaron ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The agency claims that Chidambaram's son Karti Chidambaram took a bribe
 hai court ke jaj ne kaha ki yah aarthik aparaadh he isse sakhti se nipta janaa chahie
 The hands of the investigating agencies cannot be tied in this way, that too in such a big economic crime
 pehali nazar main tathy bataa rahe hai ki yachikakarta yani chidambaram is cese main king pin hai, yani mukhya sutaradhar hai, saazishakarta hai
 It should not be forgotten that there has been a finance minister
 ve ek saansad hai isliye agrim zamaanat mili yah zaruri nahin he
 The comments in the judgment of advance surety are very strict, sounding like a judgment
 yah tippanee sibiai or idi ko raajnneetik badale kii karrwai ke aaropon se bachane main madad karegi
 It is being pointed out in the media that Judge Sunil Gaur is going to retire in 48 hours
 ritairement ke aakhri lamhe tak jaj faisla dete hai, yah saamaanya baat he
 Yes, it is a coincidence that on August 15, earlier Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that i am seeing a new trend
 kuch jaj apane ritairement ke do din pehle aise jajment dete hai jinaki kanoonee vaidhata par sawaal uthta he or faisle dene ke baad jaj tivi dibet main baithkar sahi bataane lagate hai, jo sahi nahin he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said this at a function of the Bar Association of the Supreme Court
 maine sirf ek misaal di, donon baton kii tulana nahin kii
 The legalists will surely challenge the High Court's decision in the Supreme Court on their own basis
 wo kah sakate hai ki is cese main saare saboot dastavezon par aadhaarit hai or aaropee bhaag nahin saktaa he to bel mil sakati he
 But what can the Supreme Court decide, how can it be inferred
 pi chidambaram congress ke saansad hai
 The Congress party is silent today, their lawyers are speaking
 19 agast ke prime time main ham ek sankhya par thithak gaye the
 When a member of the textile association said that between 25 and 50 lakh jobs were lost
 textile sector main bikri 30 se 35 percent ghat gai he
 Exports are down by more than 30 percent
 jis sector main 10 karod se adhik log rojgaar or kaarobaar pate hon unki sthiti thik nahin hai
 We talked to many people
 mandi or nuksaan ke bich saahas kii bhi mandi aa gai he
 Very few people want to come on camera and talk
 karodon ke bijness main hai
 If you ask for bytes for TV, then you take the edge
 isliye aarthik mandi ke saath-saath bolne ke saahas kii mandi bhi ai hui he
 It was heard from the off-record fragrance that he never saw such a slowdown
 utaar-chadhaav to dekha he magar aisa sannata kabhi nahin dekha-suna
 But Tuesday morning was a little different
 indian express main ek vigyaapan chhapata he
 The advertisement appears on page number three and half-page
 angrezi main chape is vigyaapan main kaha gaya he ki bharat kaa katai udyog sabase bade sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he, jiske kaaran baari sankhya main naukariyaan ja rahi hai
 The sketch in the advertisement shows that people are standing in a queue and no job is hanging
 katai kshamta kaa ek tihaai band ho chukaa he
 Millions have been lost
 katai milen bharat ke kisaanon se kapaas kareedne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 This will also have an impact on cotton farmers
 agle sizan main 80,000 karod ke kapaas utpaadan kii aashaa he
 If this cotton is not sold, the textile crisis will reach agriculture
 kheti ke baad rojgaar ke sabase bade sector kii yah haalat he
 The advertisement was published on behalf of Northern India Textile Mills Association
 kyon chapa gaya tha, iskaa jawaab bhi likhaa he ki bharat kaa textile udyog sarkaar kaa tavajjo chahta he
 Did the textile industry, which has been going through the crisis for a year, not get any attention that someone had to tell their grief by getting the advertisement out
 bijness akhbaaron main textile udyog ke sankat par khabaren or vishleshan chap rahe hai, iske baad bhi industry ko vigyaapan dena pad gaya ki sarkaar kaa dhyaan chahie
 Surely the news of such a big crisis in Hindi newspapers is suppressed in the district edition itself and it does not bother to bring them to the national level
 hindi channelon kii to baat hi chhod dijie
 Here the machine is spinning cotton after which a thread will be formed
 bharat main kareeb saadhe teen karod spindal hai jin par kapaas kii katai hoti he
 Nearly 6 million spindles are closed
 jahaan katai chal rahi he vahaan bhi kaam kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 Till 6-7 months ago, these machines used to work seven days and twenty four hours, now one or two days in the weeks the machines have started shutting down
 katai ke sector main 6 karod logon ke judane kii baat kahi jaati he
 We kept checking again and again that if the work of 50 lakh people has been taken away, then the answer was that yes, the work of about 50 lakh people has been temporarily lost
