 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday that inflation has been a concern for the country in recent times, but it is expected to come down to around seven per cent by the end of the financial year
 pradhanmantri ne saat res course maarg sthiti apane sarkari awaas par electronic media ke patrakaron ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, "mahangaai, visheshkar khaadya mahangaai dar ek samasya he
 But it is expected to reach seven per cent by the end of this financial year
 " unhone kaha ki sarkaar yah sunishchit karnaa chaahati he ki vikaas dar prabhavit na ho
 The government is battling inflation at a time when all things are not under our control
 unhone kaha, "pratikul vaishvik sthiti main hamen mahangaai ko niyantrit karnaa pad rahaa he
 " apane ek aadesh main bombai hai court ne spasht kiya he ki mahaj aapasi sahmati se koi pati-patni dastavej taiyaar kar talaak nahin le sakate hai
 Not only this, the court also rejected the order of a family court, which by mutual consent rejected the plea of the couple seeking divorce with an exemption in the waiting period of six months
 hai court ne maamle ko talaak ke liye phir se parivaar adaalat bhej diya he
 In fact, Mittal and Manoj Panchal were married to Hindu customs in April 2007, but within a year the dispute started between the two
 unhone alag hone kaa faisla kiya or june 2011 main aapasi sahmati se ‘talaak kaa dastavej’ taiyaar kiya
 They were not aware that such a divorce has not been recognized by law
 donon ne is amaanya talaak ke baad duusari shaadi kii
 The woman then applied for a US visa, as her second husband was living there
 lekin america duutavas ne adalati talaak ke aadesh kii maang kii
 In such a situation, the woman and her ex-husband filed a divorce petition from the family court under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, seeking relaxation in the required six-month waiting period
 parivaar adaalat ne unki yachika khaarij kar di, jiske baad mahila ne bombai ucch nyaayalay kaa ruukh kiya
 'the marriage was over, so the divorce should be considered' In the case, a High Court bench headed by Justice VK Tahilramani recently ordered that the family court order not be admissible according to facts and law
 hai court ne kaha ki yachika ko khaarij karne ke liye parivaar adaalat ke bataae gaye tark kanoonee taur par khare nahin utarate
 Divorce should be considered as the marriage was over and later the two parties separated and agreed to divorce
 'duusari shaadi kar lee, isliye intjaar karne kii koi vajah nahin'peeth ne kaha ki hindu kanoon ke tahat vivaah ko do logon ke bich anubandh ke taur par nahin mana jaataa
 As the couple's divorce was served on the couple, the marriage bond was not ended legally between the complainants, hence the petition filed under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act is considered
 peeth ne apane aadesh main kaha ki chunki donon ne phir shaadi kar lee, isliye jaruri chah maah kii avadhi tak intjaar karne ke liye kehane kii koi vajah nahin he
 Therefore, the case is referred back to the family court to issue a divorce order

 kapil sibbal or rajeev dhawan kii ore se court main daleel di gai thi ki is maamle kii jald sunwaayee subramanyam swami kii apil ke baad shuru hui, jo ki is maamle main koi party bhi nahin hai
 Sibal had said that the court should not send a wrong message to the country, but should hear the case with a large bench
 unhone kaha tha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan bijepi ke saal 2014 ke ghoshnaptr main shaamil he
 Therefore, the court should not fall into the trap of BJP
 kapil sibbal ne court se kaha tha ki desh kaa maahaul abhi aisa nahin he ki is maamle kii sunwaayee sahi tareeke se ho sake
 Hearing is being held in a hurry regarding this issue
 sunni vakf board kii ore se kapil sibbal ne maang kii thi ki maamle kii sunwaayee 5 yaa 7 jajon bench ko saal 2019 ke aam chunaav ke baad kerani chahie, kyonki maamla raajnneetik ho chukaa he

 geet ke bol hai, 'phir se ek baar ho, bihar main bahaar ho, phir se ek baar ho, nitish kumaar ho
 'JDU has also released the ringtone of this song with the aim of reaching the mobile phones of the supporters
 yah geet party kaaryakartaaon ko samarpit kiya gaya he
 The song will be used during Nitish Kumar's promotional campaign 'har Ghar Dastak'
 jediu kaa yah 'door-tu-door' campan guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahaa he
 In the coming 30 days, 10 lakh JDU workers will contact 3 crore people at their homes and campaign
 gauratlab he ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main is baar sattarudh jediu, argedy or congress ke saath milakar lard rahi he
 On the other hand, Jitan Ram Manjhi's party has also joined the bjp-led NDA
 shaheedon kii shahadat ko vatan yaad karata he lekin bihar main shaheedon ko lekar jo kuch ho rahaa he use kisi bhi tareeke se uchit nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 25 CRPF personnel were killed in Sukma of Chhattisgarh, out of which 6 were from Bihar
 bihar sarkaar ne shaheedon ke ashriton ko paanch-paanch lakh rupee dene kaa elaan to kiya lekin bihar sarkaar kaa koi mantri shradhanjali dene nahin gaya
 The father of the martyr of Ara demanded two yards of land to build a memorial in memory of the son, which the district administration refused to accept compensation if not accepted
 bijepi ne yahaan tak aarope lagaaya kimukhyamantri nitish kumaarake kafile kii vajah se shaheedon ke shav kii gaadi ko rokna padaa tha
 The Deputy Chief Minister was a few steps away from Patna Airport but he too did not go to pay tribute to the martyrs
 aapako bataa den ki, yah koi pehla munkaa nahi he jab rajya sarkaar par shaheedon ke parijanon ne aarope lagaaya ho
 At the same time, Gajendra Mishra, father of the martyr Abhay Mishra of Bhojpur, wants to build a memorial in memory of his son
 isliye unhone bhojpur jila prashasan se jameen kii maang kii he
 But the district administration rejected their demand saying that they cannot give the land until the order comes from the headquarters
 shahid ke pita ne kaha ki jo sarkaar shahid ke bete ke liye do gaj jameen nahi de sakati he usase muaavja kya lenaa isliye unhone muaavje kii raashi lautaa di he
 Significantly, the insensitive attitude of the district administration makes the martyr's family unhappy, the people of the surrounding villages are also unhappy
 shahid ke pita chaahate the ki jahaan bete kaa antim sanskaar ho vahiin par uskaa smarak banaaya jaae
 Jabashid Abhay Mishraka funeral was performed with full state honors on Wednesday morning but no minister or representative of the government was present on the occasion
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki yah bahut hi dukhad he, or durbhagypurna he mukhyamantri cinema dekh rahe the, or mukhyamantri awaas se mushkil se aadhe kilometre kii duuri par hawaii adda he, or saare mantriyon kaa bangala ek falong kii duuri par he
 If the Chief Minister could not go for any reason, he could have sent the preferred minister
 lekin bihar sarkaar kaa koi mantri vahaan maujuud nahin tha
 And the saddest thing is that the martyrdom of the martyrs was stopped so that the Chief Minister's convoy could leave
 main is tarah kesamvedansheel muddaper zyada tipanni nahin karunga, main to bas itnaa hi kahuunga ye durbhagypurna he, aisi ghatana se desh main bihar kii chhavi kharaab hoti he, or bhavishya main mukhyamantri ko aisi ghatana se bachanaa chahie
 Sushil Modi also took a dig at Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, and said that when he was age, Tejashwi Yadav was to teach, to understand something, what can he expect from him
 jab mukhyamantri ne hi sammaan prakat nahin kiya to up mukhyamantri par kya tipanni karen
 He grew up in the rites of Lalu Yadav, the rightful people of social justice have the right to humiliate them
 desh kii suraksha kii jimmedaari rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ke haath main hai
 But this time he saved PM Modi from embarrassment in the White House
 mangalvaar ko piem modi or america raashtrapati donald trump sanyukt press vaarta ko sambodhit kar rahe the usee dauraan piem ke podium se kuch kaajagaat hawa ke jhoke main ud gaye dobhaal ne tunrat unhen jamaa kar piem ko saunp diya
 Actually, it happened that PM Modi had written his address in the press conference
 roj garden main america raashtrapati donald trump apana bhaashan pard rahe the or pradhanmantri modi use dhyaan se sun rahe the
 At the same time, with the help of strong wind, some documents kept on PM Modi's podium and flew down
 lekin agali line main hi baithe dobhaal ne mustaidi dikhaate hue unhen pakad liya or waapas podium par rakh diya
 During the press conference again, the wind blow removed the necessary documents from the podium, which Doval again submitted and handed over to PM Modi
 isse pehle white house main piem modi kaa raashtrapati trump aurfirst ladi ne joardaar swaagat kiya
 Also, PM Modi was the first foreign leader for whom Trump hosted a dinner at the White House
 piem kaa america daura kaaphi safal mana ja rahaa he kyonki piem modi or trump kii mulaakaat se pehle hi america ne lashkar commander saiyad salahuddin ko atanrarashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya
 At the same time, both countries have agreed to walk side by side on the terrorism front
 apni america yatra khatm karke piem modi netherland pahunch chuke hai

 At the age of twelve, i first fell in love with Virender Pratap Singh, the same calm and mature Virender Pratap of Yash Chopra's film Lamhe, played by Anil Kapoor
 iske baad 17 varsh kii umr main da english pesheynt ke count lasajlo se pyaar hua
 i would look for such a quiet, low-speaking boy in my twenties that the bundle of love in his heart would break only for me
 afsos kii baat yah ki sab bejaar or besudh nikle
 i could never find Virendra and Laszlo because they did not exist

 Romantic movies give us the opportunity to weave fantasy and we live in hope
 aaj ummid buddhuon ke liye hoti he or buddhuon par sirf dayaa hi kii ja sakati he
 Is anyone there for us? If he has not found or found us on Facebook, Twitter, linkedin or Shaadi
com, we are not going to wait for him
 romantic filmon kii jagah nishchit rup se romantic kamedi ne le lee he
 The soundtrack is replaced by the wailing sound of the violin replaced by loud banging music, pop, whistles and flush sound
 apane aashiq ke liye intjaar karti yaa uski baahon main samaane ke liye daudti aurat ab puraane jamaane kii maani jaati he
 The viewer wants to laugh, does not want to tear tears
 dialog bhi haas-parihaas ke tadake vaale hone chahie
 If a man covers a woman in his arms, then he has to hit his head with his head to bring such 'laugh loud' moments
 agar vah prapoj karata he to use ise naamanzoor karnaa hoga kyonki shaadi kii sanstha puraani pad chuki he
 Now the hero is not rejected, only by his foolishness as a best friend can the hero become a character of ridicule
 esemes bhashaa or shabd sankshep kii duniya main romance puraane fishan kii baat ho chukaa he, tab sachche pyaar kaa matlab balidaan hota tha
 Romance takes place between man and woman
 ab romantic kamedi kaa mukhya nayak ladke or ladakiyon se bada hokar mard or aurat main badal gaya he
 Love is synonymous with sexual chemistry
 ve, or shaayad ham sab qurbaani jaisi chizon se nipatane ke maamle main bahut aparipakv or aatmakendrit hai
 This is the era of the 'first I'
 pyaar kaa vichaar badal chukaa he isliye shaayad romance kii avadharana ab vastav main kamedi paidaa karne vaali he
 i call it Jigsaw Love Syndrome
 hamaare paas apane ko kisi ke anukool banane yaa badalane ke liye ab dhairya yaa samay nahin bachaa he
 We need someone who can create our life
 jaise hi fasebuk par koi hamaare friendship request ko sweekaar karata he, ham apane sambhavit partner ke ateet, vartmaan, uski pasand or naapsand kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 We have formed an opinion about them and have also decided
 samasya bas itani he ki vah vyakti ‘vahi’ nahin he
 Every jigsaw piece has four sides, so there can be four definite possibilities
 ek ke saath hi kyon tike rahen jab teen anya maujuud hon
 Apart from our own aspirations, there is no pressure from any other external force
 hamaare upar maa-baap kaa niyantran nahin he, or dhan, phone yaa internet ke bina premi ke saath bhagkar kisi nadi ke kinare bane jhonpade main rahanaa bilkul avyaavhaarik baat he
 Today my 15-year-old niece and her friends have just one wish for their future: she may not be a handsome prince riding a white horse, but she is very rich
 bina kisi dwandv ke yah kahana hoga ki upbhogwaad main lipt hone kii hamaari nirankush ichha ke alaava romance badanaseeb bevakoofon ke liye he
 The boys singing the song while playing guitar strings with their girlfriend are not reliable
 keval webakuf-romantic fools-hi bepanaah jazbe ke saath pyaar karte hai
 Realist then tries to get an expensive car
 parikthaayen bacchon ke liye hoti hai
 Twitter is for adults where a film is predicted to hit or flop before its opening week
 darshak film dekhne se pehle hi uski kahani jaananaa chaahate hai
 The beauty of searching is over because now we have become accustomed to a world in which instant information reaches us by pressing a button
 film kii kahani kaa puraa mode jaanane ke liye teen ghante baithkar film dekhnaa maut kii sajaa jaisaa he
 As the battery life decreases, both the phone and the relationship seem meaningless
 data transfar main tasviren or sandesh gum ho jate hai
 There are no longer boxes in which filled photos and letters are gradually transformed into wealth
 bhaawanaaon kii banjar bhoomi lagaataar badi or badi hoti ja rahi he
 We remain independent and burdened with the latest operating platform and a blank memory card
 ab aisa lagata he ki romantic filmein kisi gujarey jamaane kii cheez hai
 Perhaps we have seen the last such film
 iske liye hamen khud ko or apane smartphone ko dosha dena hoga
 Devika Bhagat is the screenwriter jiophone yugers ko ab nahin milegaa 49 rupee vaale plan kaa phaaydajiophone yugers ko ab 75 rupee kii shuruaati keemat se khareednaa hoga planbite 6 disambar ko reliance jeeyo ne tarriff plance main badlaav kiya tha
 However, during this time the company did not increase the prices of jiophone plans
 company ne abhi in plance kii keemten to nahin badhaai he lekin sabase saste 49 rupee vaale jeeophone plan ko hataa diya gaya he
 Plans are now starting from Rs 75
 kuch hafton pehle jeeyo ne jiophone yugers ke liye nae ol-in-van plance ko pesh kiya tha
 The Rs 75 plan is part of this
 jeeophone graahakon ke liye richarge ke liye 99 rupee, 153 rupee, 297 rupee or 594 rupee vaale plance bhi uplabdh hai, lekin graahakon ko non-jeeyo minutes ke liye IUC top-ap richarge karana hoga
 Reliance Jio's jiophone attracted millions of customers due to its price being Rs 1,500
 haalanki jeeophone yugers ke liye sabase acchhee baat ye thi ki unke liye 49 rupee vaala plan uplabdh tha
 In this plan, Jio used to give unlimited voice calling without FUP limit and 1GB data for 28 days
 haalanki IUC top-ap vauchar ke aane ke baad 49 rupee vaala plan kharidne vaale graahakon ko IUC top-ap richarge kharidne kii jarurat pad rahi thi
 However, according to the report of telecomtalk, this plan has been removed
 pichley hafte reliance jeeyo ne keemton main badhotaree karte hue apane tarriff plance ko apadet kiya tha
 Now the removal of the Rs 49 plan can also be part of this
 saath hi aapako bataa den chunki jeeophone ke plance apadet nahin hue hai isliye ab plance kii keemat 75 rupee se shuru hoti he
 Last month, Reliance Jio introduced all-in-one recharge plans for jiophone
 in plance main non-jeeyo minutes bhi milte hai
 These plans are Rs 75, Rs 125, Rs 155 and Rs 185
 ab base plan yani 75 rupee vaale plan main graahakon ko analimited jeeyo tu jeeyo wais colling, 500 minute non-jeeyo colling, roj 100MB data, kul 50SMS or 28 dinon kii validity milegi

 ) india today ke sampadak prabhu chawla ne ajtak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main maharashtra ke grahamantri ravsahab ramarao patil se baat kii
 Major excerpt: You are very happy to be home minister again
 pichhali baar aapako istipha dena padaa tha
 But Pawar saheb spared your honor by making you home minister again? i will fulfill my responsibility
 rajya kii janata kii suraksha ke liye jo karnaa aavashyak hoga vah main jaan hatheli par rakhkar karne kii puri koshish karuunga
 You will also sacrifice the last drop of your blood for this? i will show whatever invitation you have to offer to the people of Maharashtra
 aap to baad main nyochhavar karenge
 It seems that the people of your police department will give you the first invitation? The police is divided and one officer even went as far as to say - My officers ran away on 26 / 11? They will not allow division or division in the police department
 jo bhi adhikari is tarah kaa kaam karenge ham unhen police dal main nahin rakhenge or unke khilaaf sakht karrwai karenge
 One of your officers Gafoor (former Mumbai Police Commissioner Hassan Gafoor) has said that four elder officers, one of whom also became a martyr, fled in fear
 26 / 11 se chaar din pehle ek adhikari ke is bayaan ko aap thik samajhate hai?unhone thik-thik kya kaha he, maine dekha nahin he
 Nevertheless, full information will be collected
 main asies ko bhi jaanch ke liye kahuunga
 But i saw that the police of Maharashtra had done a good job and many of our officers and soldiers were martyred
 aisa to nahin ki aapke dobaaraa grahamantri banane ke baad bade-bade adhikari aapako naakaam karne ke liye ekajute ho gaye hai?mujhe to aisa nahin lagata
 In which context, they will know all about it
 aar
 R
 patil ko ve ek kamjor grahamantri maanate hai?maine kuch aise kaam karke dikhaaen hai jisase koi bhi mujhe kamjor nahin kahegaa
 What i am: The people of Maharashtra have complete information about me
 aapane aisa kya kiya he?maharashtra kii janata or police ke liye maine bahut saare kaam kiye hai
 We were finished on a grand scale, there was a NAFTA racket, there was a matka, there was illegal liquor
 police main 40,000 bhartiyon kii gayi lekin ek ru
 Neither did corruption
 gunvattta ke aadhaar par garib ghar ke noujvaan bhi police main bhartee hue
 If you were a good home minister then why did your image become such that you are weak, decent while the police department needs a strong man? In the second innings, you will also see this
 getwe aaf india main to bechaare police vaale sadak par soe hue the?aage aapako aisa dikhaai nahin degaa
 The wives of the martyred police officers, Vinita Kamte and Kavita Karkare, have alleged that their husbands were killed because the police officers did not fulfill their responsibility? The Ram Pradhan Committee has given its findings
 is par zyada bahes karnaa thik nahin
 Our brave officers tried to go where it was necessary
 unamem se kuch shahid bhi ho gaye
 i will take full information from them
 aapke saamne ek nai chunauti he-gundaraj bad gaya he
 The offices of the media and the channel have been attacked? The Home Minister is not responsible for what happened in the Assembly
 kal jo hamalaa hua usamen ham kisi ko nahin bakhshenge
 Mumbai is the financial capital of the country
 yah antarrashtriya shahar he
 The medium (media) is important in democracy
 patrakaron par hue hamale ke jimmedaar logon par ham gairajamaanti dharaaen lagaayenge
 In the case of Raj Thackeray, it is being said that you are soft towards him
 unke khilaaf halki dharaaen lagaai jaati hai taaki jamaanat mil jaae?ye galat aarope he
 We talked to senior lawyers and set up the streams
 aage aisa nahin hoga
 Bala Saheb Thackeray has just said about Sachin Tendulkar
 ek tarah kii pratispardhaa chal rahi he
 It seems that your government is also unable to decide whether to take all the Maharashtrians along or the Marathi manush
 yah baat sahi he ki un donon main compitashan chal rahaa he
 This is hurting the people of Maharashtra
 26 / 11 dobaaraa na ho iske liye aap kya kar rahe hai?iske liye bahut se kadam pichley saal uthaae gaye the
 Whatever shortcomings will be overcome with full force
 suraksha or naksalwad meri praathamikta main sabase upar hai
 Task force-one has been created on the basis of NSG
 quick rispance team (kuarti) bhi banaai gai he
 Our police team will be the best in the country
 aapke saamne sabase badi chunauti kya he-shivasainikon kii gundgardee yaa aatankwaad?aatankwaad
 We can handle these people anytime
 hamen aatankwaad or naksalwad se ladanaa he
 General police is enough for them

 unhone kaha ki hamaare beemaa kshetra kaa prasar bahut kam he
 He said that the government wants Indian companies like Life Insurance Corporation of India to be world class like Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar
 sinha ne is vidheyak ko pesh karne se pehle isi sambandh main purv main laaye gayi ek vidheyak ko waapas liya
 That bill was referred to the Select Committee
 vitt rajya mantri jayant sinha ne kaha ki yah vidheyak keval jivan beemaa se hi sambandhit nahin he
 He said that we have to strengthen various areas of general insurance like health insurance, crop insurance in our country
 unhone kaha ki desh ke beemaa kshetra main puunji kii bahut aavashyaktaa he kyonki desh main jaise jaise beemaa kshetra kaa prasar hoga, daavon ke bhugtan ke liye dhan kii jarurat hogi
 He said that Indian life insurance is doing commendable work
 sinha ne kaha ki aaj elisi jaisi ek nahin das companiyon kii jarurat he
 Such companies should be able to compete globally
 unhone railway dwaara elisi se kiye gayi sahmati qaraar kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki yadi hamaari jivan beemaa companiyaan majboot hongi to aadharbhoot kshetra ke liye hamen adhik nivesh mil sakegaa

 The Congress's MV Rajeev Gowda started the discussion by saying that the NDA government is taking forward the efforts of the UPA government itself and now it is expanding its scope
 unhone kaha ki desh main behatar beemaa bazaar kii jarurat he or adhiktam logon ko iske daayre main laayaa janaa chaiye kyonki desh ke lagbhag 90 pratishat logon ke paas koi beemaa nahin he
 He said that the benefit of this bill should be ensured to the poorest of the poor and diversification of insurance products should be done
 unhone kaha ki pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kii seemaa ko 49 pratishat par simit kar bhartiya swaamitv ko sunishchit kiya janaa chaiye
 bjp's Chandan Mitra supported the bill and said that this bill has been prepared by negotiating with more and more parties
 unhone kaha ki swasthya beemaa kaa kawarej desh main abhi bhi bahut kam logon ko praapt he jise badhaane kii aavashyaktaa he or beemaa kii pahunch kaa vistaar karne ke lihaaj se bhi yah vidheyak mahatvapurn he
 Mitra said that the spread of insurance facilities is less in rural areas and this initiative of the government will progress in this direction
 unhone tamaam viksit deshon kaa udhaaharan diya jahaan beemaa ke kshetra main 100 pratishat tak epadiai kii anumati praapt he
 Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said that the perception was being made that increasing the limit of FDI would also increase the spread of insurance
 unhone dharna galat sabit hui he ki epadiai seemaa badhane se is kshetra kaa prasar hoga
 He said that private companies will come into the country inspired by their profit motive and not because of their social obligations here
 unhone lakhon logon ko rojgaar dene vaali elisi kii saraahna karte hue kaha ki daavon ke niptaan ke maamle main vishwa main uskaa ricard he
 He said that raising the FDI limit will bring bankrupt foreign companies to this country, which will not be effectively controlled

 isi kram main makapa ke di raja ne is vidheyak se jude adhyadesh ke niramodan ke liye ek pariniyat sankalp rakhaa
 After this, CP Rajiv of CPI and Naresh Aggarwal of SP raised the issue that the Insurance Law Amendment Bill 2015 is going to be discussed in the House
 aisa hi ek vidheyak sadan main pehle pesh kiya gaya tha or use pravar samiti ke paas bheja gaya tha
 Both members questioned what would happen to that old bill
 sadan main isko lekar kaaphi der tak kai sadasyon ne apane apane tark die
 Some members objected that this was not considered in the Business Advisory Committee before the Insurance Law Amendment Bill 2015 was put on the agenda of the House

 The relationship between Mamata Banerjee and Mukul Roy, two senior Trinamool Congress leaders, is no longer normal
 donon netaaon ke matbhed ab janata ke saamne ujagar ho gaye hai
 Although Mukul Roy also attended the meeting held on Saturday at Mamta Banerjee's residence at Kali Ghat in Kolkata, the situation was clear to all the leaders involved in this meeting that Didi and Mukul Da's ways were not normal
 is baithak kii khaas baat yah rahi ki mamata ne pehle sabhi netaaon ko bolne ke liye aamantrit kiya, lekin jab koi bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin hua to unhone khud dedh ghante apane style main bhaashan diya
 Mamta accused the BJP that she wanted to break her party Trinamool by taking Mukul Roy under cbi's hold
 darasal mamata ne do kaarnon se aisa bayaan diya he
 Earlier, he had the idea that the CBI would arrest Mukul Roy after interrogation and that Mukul Roy would attack PM Modi and Amit Shah in the style of Didi as soon as he went to the CBI office, but Mukul Roy neither arrested nor made any such statement
 isse trinmul pramukh mamata banerjee ko shaq ho gaya ki mukul roy or bijepi ke netaaon ke bich koi deal hui he, isliye shanivaar ko mamata ne is baat ko sarvajanik karte hue mukul roy or bijepi donon ko baikfoot par laane kii koshish kii he
 In Saturday's meeting, Mamata repeatedly named another MP, Shubhendu Adhikari, and said that the CBI would try to arrest him too
 mamata ke is bayaan se bhi is baat kaa ishaara miltaa he kii unhen ehsaas he ki mukul roy ke baad sibiai unhen pareshan kar sakati hai
 Mamta Banerjee's problem is also that during the questioning of Mukul Roy most of the questions were related to the Chief Minister and many answers were such that Mamata may also come under scrutiny in the coming days

 ) You must have heard about 'plastic rice'
 in dinon usase sambandhit kuch video viral ho rahe hai
 The presence of plastic rice in the market has been written on social media for a long time
 mangalvaar ko telugana or andhrapradesh main plastic chaaval ne khub afratfari machaai
 Rumors arose on social media that some grocery stores are selling plastic rice
 darasal, mangalvaar ko telugana main mirpet ke ek shaks ne kiraane kii dukaan par plastic ke chaaval milane kii shikaayat police se kii thi
 Let me remind you that two days before that a customer in Saruranagar, Hyderabad claimed to have used plastic rice on Biryani Point
 shikaayat par karrwai karte hue civil supplise department ke adhikariyon ne mirpet kii dukaan par chapa maaraa or chaaval ke sample jabt kar use jaanch ke liye lab bhej diya
 Meanwhile, rumors spread on social media that plastic rice is being sold on a large scale in Andhra Pradesh
 soshal media par yah baat jaise-jaise share hoti gai logon kii bechaini badhati gai
 The talk of plastic rice has scared people
 TOI kii khabar ke mutabik mirpet police ne bataaya ki nandanvanam colony ke nivasee ashok ne shikaayat darj kar bataaya tha ki pichley kuch dinon se unhen or unke parivaar waalon ko pet ke saath-saath haath or pairon main dard kii shikaayat rah rahi he
 According to him, when he returned home from work on Monday night, he noticed that the food served by his wife to him was not fit to eat and looked like mashed
 maap-tol vibhaag ke assistant food controlar shrinivas raav ne TOI ko bataaya, "hamen bhi soshal netwarking cites ke jariye hiplastic yaa nakli chaavalki jaankaree mili he
 Till now we have not received any instructions in this regard from our top officials but i am sending 4 food inspectors to investigate the rice of the rice traders of Vikhapatnam
 "haalanki rajya ke chaaval vyapaariyon ne plastic chaaval kii baat ko sire se khaarij kar diya or usase judi khabaron ko jhootha bataaya
 Of a rice merchant
 bhim raav ne TOI se baatcheet ke dauraan bataaya, "shahar main plastic ke chaaval nahin bik rahe hai
 By the grace of God, there is no shortage of rice in Andhra Pradesh, due to which fake or plastic rice is sold here
 "aise karen asli or nakli (plastic) chaaval ke bich kaa fark- plastic ke chaaval se khushboo nahin aegi
 - After cooking, plastic rice will give the smell of plastic
 - asli chaaval pakaane ke baad aasaani se dab jaataa he jabaki nakli chaaval kaa dana pakane par bhi tite rahata he
 - Fake rice does not break faster than real rice
 - jab bhi market se zyada maatra main chaaval laaen to ek mutthi chaaval ko tave par garm karke dekh len
 Plastic rice will start melting in it
 jabaki shuddh chaaval bhunakar kadak ho jaaenge
 If you want, first make a little rice and identify its real and fake
 a post shared by Alia (@aliaabhatt) on Jan 2, 2018 at 9:59am PST This is the first time India will land a World Cup match against Pakistan without Sachin Tendulkar
 donon deshon ke bich world cap main ab tak hue 5 muqaabalon main se teen main sachin main of da match rahe
 Presenting interesting stories related to these interesting 5 matches of World Cup history
 bharat-pakistan world cap muqablesidney, 1992:toss jeetne ke baad bhartiya captain mohammad ajaharuddin ne pehle ballebaajar chuni
 Ravi Shastri was dropped and freshman Ajay Jadeja was sent for the opening in his second match
 unhone 46 ran banaakar apni upyogita sabit bhi kii
 But the hero of the innings remained Sachin Tendulkar
 sachin ne 54 ran banaae or bharat ne 49 over main 216 ran banaae
 In response, Pakistan had a poor beginning as well as an end
 aamir sohail ke 62 or javed miyandad ke 40 ranon ke baavjood pakistan jeet nahin paaya
 Pakistan lost their last 8 wickets for just 68 runs
 bharat 43 ranon se match jeeta, lekin match ke nattejey se zyada bhartiya wicketiper kiran more or javed miyandad kaa vivaad charchaa main rahaa
 Frustrated with More's excessive appeal, Miandad started copying him on the field and took a bat in his hand and jumped into the air
 ampiron ne match referi ted vicks ko report di, jinhone donon tiimon ke manageron ko talab kar vivaad nipataane ke liye kaha
 Bangalore, 1996: The land belonged to India and India also won the toss
 pehle ballebaaji karne utari team india ne navjot siddhu ke shandaar 93 ranon kii badaulat ek majboot score kii taraf kadam to badhaayaa lekin pari ko gati di ajay jadeja kii tufaani pari ne
 Jadeja played a quick innings of 45 runs in just 25 balls
 pari ke aakhri 3 over main to bharat ne 51 ran batore
 Of these 3 overs, 2 overs were played by Waqar Younis, in which he lost 40 runs
 bharat ne 50 over main 8 wicket par 287 ran banaae
 In response, Pakistani openers Saeed Anwar and Aamir Sohail made a tremendous start but Venkatesh Prasad and Anil Kumble shared 3-3 wickets and pushed Pakistan to the backfoot
 pakistan ye match 39 ran se haara
 This match also brought a controversy with him
 pakistan kii ballebaaji ke dauraan openar aamir sohail ne venkatesh prasad ko balle se ishaara kiya, jawaab main prasad ne unhen agali hi gend par bold kar diya
 After the match, there was a lot of protest against his team in Pakistan
 manchester, 1999:kashmir main bharat-pakistan kii senaaon ke bich talavaarein khichin thim
 There were fears that the supporters of both teams might not clash in the field too, but the opposite happened
 shandaar maahaul ke bich donon timen manchester main maidan par utrin
 Azhar won the toss and elected to bat
 sachin ne pari ko shuruaati majbooti di to dravid or azhar ne middle order sambhalakar team india ko 6 wicket par 227 ran ke score tak pahunchaa diya
 In response, Pakistan's team could not overcome Venkatesh Prasad
 said anwar, inzamam or moin khan ne koshish to bahut kii lekin lagaataar girte viketon ke bich pakistan sirf 180 ran hi bana sakaa
 Venkatesh Prasad took 5 wickets for 27 runs and was the man of the match
 centurian, 2003:june 2000 ke baad bharat-pakistan ke bich ye pehla match tha
 The mercury was also increased due to this match in the scorching heat of South Africa
 world cap main bharat ke khilaaf pakistan ne pehali baar toss jeeta or ballebaaji karne utari
 Pakistan scored 273 for 7 wickets thanks to a superb 101 from Saeed Anwar
 bharat ballebaaji karne utraa to wasim, vakaar or shoeb akhtar kii tikdi se paar paanaa pehali chunauti thi
 But in such circumstances, Sachin played the most memorable innings of this World Cup
 khaskar shoeb akhtar kii gendon kii to aisi dhunaai hui, jise aaj bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 When Sachin was at 32, his leg was stretched, but despite this he persisted and he was out only 2 runs before his century
 lekin dravid or yuvaraj ne team ko jeet kii manzil tak pahunchaa hi diya
 Mohali, 2011: It was a semi-final of the World Cup
 donon deshon ke pradhanmantri match dekhne pahunche the
 Obviously there was pressure
 toss bharat ke naam rahaa or dhoni ne pehle ballebaaji chuni
 Sehwag started fast and Sachin tied the innings
 ek ke baad ek mili 4 jeevanadaanon kii badaulat sachin ne 85 thoke or bharat ne 9 wicket par 260 ran banaae
 In response, Pakistan could score only 231 runs and India reached the final
 pakistan kii taraf se is match ke mujrim misbah-ul-haq kehalaae, jinaki dhimi ballebaaji par haar kaa thikra phoda gaya
 Gold and silver shopping is considered auspicious on many occasions here
 dhanteras, diwali, akshay tritiya aadi par to jamkar sona kharida jaataa he
 But the dilemma remains whether to buy coins or jewelry
 tyoharon ke maukey par kai ofer hamen lubhaate hai or gahanon ke aakarshak dizin dekhakar lagata he ki bas yahi rhite chois he
 But if you stop and think a little, then you will find that it is better to buy more coins than jewelry
 ye hai wo kaaran jo bataate hai ki aakhirkaise he sone or chaandi ke sikke khareednaa phaayde kaa sauda -1) menkig chargejab bhi sone kii jewelery kharidte he to us par mekking charge dena padataa he
 But when you go to sell or exchange the same jewelery, then you do not get this amount back
 isliye mekking charge ke boj se bachanaa he to sone ke sikke ko hi prifar karen
 In this way you will also get more money for more shopping on the festival
 2) kabhi bhi sikkon se banavaa len jewalerisgar aap sone kii jewelery ko sone ke sikke, biscuit yaa phir or kisi dizin main badalawa rahen hai to aapako iske badale menkig charge ke bagaiyr keval sone kii keemat milegi or aapako nae dizin ke badale jo adishnal charge dena hoga so alag
 But if you have a gold coin, then you can make jewelery anytime without any loss
 3)nivesh kaa phydemand saudanivesh kaa matlab hi he paise ko profit kamaane ke liye lagaana
 When you invest in gold jewelery, there is a loss of charging charge when you sell it
 lekin agar aapanesone kaa sikaa kharidkar nivesh kiya he to bhavishya main sone kii keemat badhane par agar aap use bechate he to aapako bina kisi nuksaan usee sikke kii zyada keemat milti he
 4) In terms of safety, the risk of theft of jewelery jewelery is high, whether you wear it or keep it
 vahiin sone ke sikkon ko ek bag main rakhana aasaan or sef hota he
 On Tuesday, on the occasion of International Women's Day, Congress President Sonia Gandhi asked the government in strong words, demanding the early passage of the Women's Reservation Bill, "give us our legitimate rights

 For example, the flag of the tricolor was being removed and the BJP flag was being installed there and the person doing so had held the tricolor between his two legs

 greece ke atis theatre kii theodoras trejopols nirdeshit prastuti ‘ankor’ unke trayee ‘alarme’ or ‘amor’ kaa hissaa he
 This is basically a presentation of a poem by Thomas Salatopis

 Discipline to actors, control of technique, sound is amazing in this presentation
 manch par ek cross banaaya gaya he jo dharmik pratik kii bhi abhivyakti karata he or abhinaytaon kii sari gatividhi is cross par hoti hai
 In response to each other's body and repeating 'encore encore encore


' the actors make a loud and sometimes whispering sound from the body which deepens the emotion intensity
 ek surrial se drishy prabhaav nirmit karti hui prastuti kaa darshanik sutara astitv ke sawaalon se judaa hua he
 How the poem should be performed on stage can be learned from this presentation
 theodoras trejopols ne theatre olympic kii shuruuaat kii he or is samiti ke adhyaksh bhi hai
 Most of the Indian audience is not yet in the habit of watching productions that have no fixed narrative element, body movements, sound support, and loud communication
 darshakon ko kathatmak aakhyaan dekhne, padhane kii adhik aadat he jisase ki wo sateek arth grahan kar saken
 While watching the play, the practice remains active in the subconscious which prevents the audience from the total taste of a series of images or visual narratives, testing its endurance
 lekin darshak dekhne kii aadaton ke saath prayog karne ke liye yadi taiyaar hon to yah avrodh bhi dur ho jaataa he
 Take the scene in the scene, see its process, and allow the scene to communicate with your senses, then it becomes associated with such presentations
 ek hindi akhbaar ke ‘sanvaadi’ kaarykram main maithili bhashaa ko lekar bada vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 Before making some serious remarks on it, these facts should be read: 1
 san pachaas ke dashak main baba nagarjun or hindi ke bade aalochak ramvilas sharma ke bich maithili ko lekar lambii bahes chali thi or nagarjun ke tarkon se rambilas sharma antat: niruttar ho gaye the
 2
 bihar ke bhootpurv mukhyamantri or aamalogon ke bich sarvaadhik lokapriy netaa swa
 Karpoori Thakur sent a proposal on behalf of his Council of Ministers in 1977, demanding the Center to include Maithili in the Constitution
 3
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee supported the inclusion of Maithili in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution in 1975 and said that Maithili is Maithili - it is not Hindi
 uparyukt uktiyaan aadhunik bharat ke teen mahaan saahitiyik or raajnneetik vibhootiyon ke hai
 Perhaps a newspaper which considers Maithili a 'dialect' could not give a better answer than these quotes of history
 khayr, baat vartmaan kii karen to ye baat sach he ki maithili ko boli maanane waalon kii sankhya bahut he
 There is also a large number of people who consider Maithili as the language of Brahmins and Kayasthas and this is due to their dominance over the system of academies and institutions
 bahut saare maithil hi maithili ko boli or brahmanon kii bhashaa maanate hai, jo unki maithili se nahin balki samaajik-bhugolic naaraazgi ko vyakt karata he
 On the other hand, they are non-maithili speaking people who worry that their language is not included in the constitution and Maithili is included in the 8th schedule of the constitution
 yah darasal padosi kii tarakkee se jalan or unki apni mehnat or tark kii kami ko darshata he
 As such, the definitions of language do not determine the number, it has its own logic
 lekin kisi jati yaa jati-samooh kaa kisi bhashaa ke saansthanik tantra par niyantran se wo bhashaa kharaab, kamatar yaa ‘boli’ nahin ho jaati
 It is the medium of expression of millions of people even outside institutions and beats in their hearts
 usamen unke muhaavarey, unke loakgeet, unki lokoktiyaan or na jane kitni paramparaayen saans leti hai
 Fuko has written somewhere, 'A language is not just a medium of dialogue, but it is also a medium to save its thousands of years of history
 ' nirmal verma bhi likhte hai, 'har shabd ek itihaas he! duniya bhar main maatrubhaashaon par khaskar kam sankhya vaali or gaiyr-sattadhari (!) bhashaaon par sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 The small number of tribal languages are disappearing and thousands of years of knowledge and experience are on the verge of ending
 'lekin maithili ko lekar jab baat aati he to ise sirf maithil brahmanon or kaaysthon se hi jodakar nahin dekha jaataa, balki ise hindi pattee main sambhavat: hindi ke prati pehla vidroh bhi mana jaataa he
 It is not long when some famous and lesser known writers of Hindi organized a seminar in Gandhi Peace Foundation, in which any language of the Hindi belt was opposed to inclusion in the 8th schedule of the Constitution and also took the name of Maithili
 i went
 kuch logon ke mat main hindi wo “grand project” he jo is desh main ekatvkaari bhoomika laa saktaa he or jiskaa vaada hamaare purakhon ne aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan kiya tha
 There is no doubt that there are more or less people of both left and south camps
 ye baat aanshik rup se sach he lekin puri sach bhi nahin he
 Modern Hindi has developed in the last few centuries and there are undoubtedly many things in favor of its role in fulfilling the unitary role in the country, which is not the aim of this article
 lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin ki kisi pracheen bhashaa ko mahaj isliye kamatar yaa avmaananaa yaa vidroh kii drushti se dekha jaae ki wo hindi pattee yaa uske baahar kaa hissaa he or jahaan kuch jatiyon kaa uske sansthaanon par varchasv he
 Ethnic domination is more or less the same in every language and the castes which are socially and economically strong also dominate the institutional system of languages
 yah saamaajik rup se prachand pragatishiltaa kaa daawa karanevaale tamilnadu main bhi he or gujarat main bhi
 Over time, this domination is also breaking and new groups are entering it
 aanshik rup se ye tulana aisi he jaise vam lekhak samoohon kaa hindi kii acadamiyon or sansthaanon par varchasv he, lekin us vajah se hindi kamatar yaa ati uttam nahin ho jaati
 Former and self of Bihar
 mukhyamantri karpuri thakur ke maithili ko die gaye samarthan kii baat is lekh main pehle hi ho chuki he
 a few days before the Emergency, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said in his interview to 'mithila Mihir' that Maithili is not Hindi, Maithili is Maithili
 unhone use samvidhan kii 8veen anusucheemen shaamil karne kaa vaada bhi kiya jise unhone dashakon baad nibhaayaa bhi
 After reading this interview, Karpoori Thakur himself agreed to give an interview in favor of Maithili
 lekin durbhaagya se apatkaal lag jane va press par sensorship kii vajah se saakshaatkaar kii yojana dhari kii dhari rah gai
 But as soon as the Janata Party government was formed in Bihar under the leadership of Karpoori Thakur after the Emergency, he did his first major job writing letters to the Center in support of Maithili
 san pachaas ke dashak main jab potti shriramlu ne ek alag andhra pradesh ke liye anshan karte hue jaan de di thi to bharat ke sattadhari varg ko kuch aisi hi chintaa thi
 He felt that states based on regional (!) Language could be a threat to the unity of the country as the country was divided on the basis of religion a few days ago
 lekin samay ke saath wo ashanka nirmul sabit hui or pataa chalaa ki ‘kshetreey bhashaa’ hi asal rashtrabhasha he or is desh kii sabhi bhashaaen darasal rashtrabhasha hi hai
 a separate Telugu-speaking province did not mean the fragmentation of the nation, rather it strengthened the nation
 haa, ye sach he ki hindi apni vajahon se aage badi
 It should also be remembered that when there was an attempt to impose Hindi in the fifties, it was opposed in many provinces - but by the time the nineties and two thousand came - people of the same states started learning Hindi because of their needs! On the other hand what happened in our neighborhood Pakistan and Sri Lanka? At the same time, he tried to impose Urdu in Bangladesh, his country was divided in just two decades
 srilanka ne sinhalai thopane kii koshish kii or srilanka dashakon tak raktranjit rahaa
 These lessons of history show that institutional attacks on mother tongues do not result in good results
 ve raashtra main algaavvaad ke beej bhi bo dete hai
 But there is more to worry about
 jab puri duniya main or khaskar bharat main bhi kam aabaadi vaali bhashaaen vilupt hone ke kagaar par hai, shabd khatm ho rahe hai-to sthaneey bhashaaen va unki vividhta hamaare shabdon ko bachaane kii sabase badi guarantee he
 Remember that languages like Maithili will remain, then Hindi will also be saved
 maithili jaisi bhashaaen wo phixd diposit hai jo hindi jaisi bhashaaon ko apane salanaa byaaj se samrudh rakhe hue he
 If Hindi is called a loose alliance, then languages like Maithili are strong but independent constituents of that alliance which have maintained a second but strong structure of security in this 'global war' of languages

 The order of his victory has also been seen in Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu kshetra kii do loksabhaa siton par bhi bhaajapa ummidavaaron ne jeet kaa paracham fahraaya
 Party candidate and Union Minister Dr
 from Udhampur
 jitendra singh or jammu loksabhaa seat se bhaajapa ummidavaar jugal kishor sharma donon ne bade antar se apni siton par parakram dikhaaya
 Both of them outstripped their rivals by more than 2014 margin
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he, ki bhale hi jammu kshetra se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar ke khilaaf anti-inkamabency kaa maahaul tha, lekin modi lahar ne chunavi tasviir badal di
 a political analyst says, "people have voted for PM Modi in Jammu region and not for the candidate
" ' rajya main congress or neshnal conference (ensi) ke bich samajhadaari banane ke baavjood ye ummidavaar bhaajapa netaaon ko haraane main naakaamayaab rahe
 In the agreement reached between the two parties, the National Conference supported the Congress candidates in both the seats
 mjedaar baat yah he ki piples democratic party (pidipi) ne bhi yahaan se kisi ko nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, all this did not work in the Modi wave and the attempt to defeat the saffron party by uniting the anti-bjp votes failed
 bhaajapa ne apane chunavi ghoshnaptr main dhara 370 or anuchhed 35A ko hataane kaa vaada kiya he
 It is believed that this election promise of BJP in the Jammu region worked to woo people
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kshetreey partiyon ensi or pidipi ne dhara 370 or anuchhed 35A par blackmel kii ranneeti apanaai thi
 Both parties had said that Jammu and Kashmir would no longer be a part of India if sections 370 and 35A were handed over
 mana ja rahaa he ki jammu kshetra ke log donon dalon kii is baat se naaraaz ho gaye or unhone bhaajapa ummidavaar ko apana vot diya
 With the trends coming on Thursday, BJP candidates started celebrating the victory in Jammu region
 kathua main party ke ek ummidavaar kaa kahana tha ki vah party kii badi jeet se bahut khush hai or unhone ummid bhi jataai ki ab party dhara 370 or 35A ko hataa degi
 Assembly elections are yet to be held in the state

 BJP has gained not only in Jammu region but also in Ladakh region
 ladakh kii ekmaatr loksabhaa seat se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar jamyang shering namagyal bhi chunaav jeet chuke hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won this seat with a margin of only 36 votes, which has increased to more than 10,000 this time
 rajya main bhaajapa kaa pradarshan 2014 ke jaisaa hi rahaa he
 This time too, the party has got three seats
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle rajya ke governor ne ladakh ko divijan kaa darja diya or ladakh ke liye ek vishvavidhyalay ko bhi manjuuri di thi
 Political pundits say that this decision also worked in favor of BJP
 bhaajapa ne prachaar ke dauraan ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh banane kaa bhi vaada kiya tha

 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chauhanan buudhvaar ko jile ke kesali vikaskhand main ek saarvajanik kaarykram ke dauraan bataaya ki pradesh main mukhyamantri yuva swarozgaar yojana, gaanvon ke paaramparik shilp main lage kaarigaron ke peshon ko bachaane ke liye nai yojana banane kaa vichaar unhen sundar bhaiya ko dekhakar aayaa
 He told that Sundar Bhaiya has been shaving for years in his native village
 lekin ghar-ghar jaakar, fatti par baitaakar hajaamat banane kaa unka purana tarika nai peedi ko raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Due to this, the youth of the village started to move towards big cities for shaving
 is baat kaa ahsaas unhen kuch din pehle hua, jab unke paitruk gaanv jait se mukhyamantri bhawan main milane aae kuch yuvakon se baatcheet main poocha ki kis kaam se shahar aae ho, to yuvakon ne bade hi sahaj andaaj main jawaab diya ki kaam kuch nahin tha hajaamat banavaane aae the, isliye sochaa kii bhaiya se hi milte jaaen
 When the Chief Minister asked the youths why not shave with the beautiful brother of the village, he replied sternly that he no longer likes to shave sitting on the old way
 shivaraj ne kaha ki sundar bhaiya ke bare main yuvaaon kii soch se rou-ba-rou hone ke baad unhone pradesh ke 53 hajaar gaanvon main paaramparik kaam main lage kaarigaron mochi, nai, dhobi, sunar, badhai va kumhaar aadi ke kaam dhandhon ko bachaane ke liye yojana banaai
 Under this, they will be trained in skill development, so that they can make changes in their traditional work according to the new-age modalities

 isse pradesh ke 5 lakh paaramparik karigar nai, mochi, dhobi sunar, kumhaar apni aadhunik dukaan khol sakenge
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that after this scheme, the youth of the village would not be attracted towards the city, at least saying that the beautiful brothers of their village do not shave by sitting in a comfortable chair, applying fragrant cream in the cool breeze of the fan

 com / s5sec3vnk5— Samajwadi Party (@samajwadiparty)december 7, 2018unhone kaha ki isi tarah se netaji jab mukhyamantri the to javaanon ke shahid hone par pradesh sarkaar kii taraf se 5 lakh rupee kii madad dena shuru kiya tha, or jab phir sarkaar bani to hamane sena, ardhsainya bal or police ke javaanon ko shahid hone par 20 lakh rupee dekar unke parivaar kii madad karne kaa kaam kiya
 Akhilesh said that in the last four and a half years, 350 army soldiers have been martyred in the BJP government at the Center
 pradhanmantri banane se pehle narendra modi ne kaha tha ki unki sarkaar banegi to ek jawan ke sir ke badale 10 sir lekar aaenge, lekin centre main sarkaar banane ke baad modi ke vaadon kaa kya hua?unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke log ab javaanon kii shahadat par charchaa karne ke bajaay desh ko mandir-masjid or hindu-muslim kii bahes main ulajhaa rahe hai
 What happened to Modi's promises Akhilesh said that Prime Minister Modi is making bullet train for the diamond traders of Ahmedabad, but why does he not provide bullet proof jacket for our soldiers who are protecting the country in difficult circumstances
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne notebandi karke sara paisa bainkon main jamaa kar liya uske baad bhi javaanon ko van rank van pension kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 Akhilesh said that along with the soldiers, farmers and youth are also very disappointed and upset with the BJP government
 bijepi ko haraayegi sapakaryakram main purv raksha mantri mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki bijepi kii sarkaar sirf apni party ke netaaon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 There is no work for all classes
 aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko haraana bahut jaruri he
 Only the Samajwadi Party can defeat the BJP, we have to unite and remove it at all costs
 unhone kaha ki janata jaanati he ki jab bhi samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar aati he to vah kisaanon, garibon, naujavaanon or mahilaon ke liye kaam karti he
 The upcoming Lok Sabha election is very important
 kisaanon, berozegaron, mahilaon or naujavaanon ko samaajawaadee party se bahut ummiden hai, samaajawaadee party ne hameshaa in virgon kii madad kii or unki samasyaon ko hal kiya he
 Even after encountering dogs in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur suspected of being man-eating, the process of attacks on children continues unabated
 police, prashasan or van vibhaag kii tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi halaat kaabo main nahin aa rahe
 So now the administration has launched a campaign for sterilization of dogs after the encounter
 magar is nasbandi ke bare main aapako bataaun usase pehle aaie jaan lijie ki aakhir 14 bacchon ke kaatil ke bare main khud prashasan kii kya raay he? aakhir ye kaatil he koun?laudspikar se elanpure sitapur main in dinonadamkhor kuttonko lekar jila prashasan laudspikar ke madhyam se elaan kara rahaa he
 In which people have been advised to avoid dogs
 upaay bataae gaye hai
 It has been said to keep children in homes
 saavdhaan rahane ke liye kaha gaya he
 All efforts are being made from all over
 164 adhikariyon kii team ko kaam par lagaaya gaya he
 Teams of forest department, police and other experts are working on this matter
 baavjood iske 14 bacchon kii maut ho chuki he
 More than 50 suspected accused dogs have been encountered
 lekin oparation 'dog' kaa nateeja zero hi dikh rahaa he
 Who are the attackers in Sitapur? It is necessary to see and understand these three things to get out of the camera and to know how much the administration is concerned about suspected man-eating dogs in Sitapur, because through these three things you will understand that children in Sitapur will understand Who is the one to attack? dog
 
 
 junglee kutta, bhediya yaa phir koi or?dm ne jari ek press relijasitapur kii dm yani jiladhikari ne sitapur ke un gaanvon main poster lagavaaye hai, jahaan sandigdh aadamkhor kutton kaa sabase zyada aatank he
 In the press release issued by the DM of Sitapur, information has been requested to reach the public
 or isi dauraan jaanwaron ke adhikaar or unki raksha se judy ek sanstha bhi saamne ai he
 The institution which DM himself has mentioned in his press release
 prashasan ne jari kiya postaub aaie shuruuaat poster se karte hai
 In this poster it is clearly written that the children of wild dogs are behind all the children killed or injured in Sitapur and its surrounding villages
 wo junglee kute hi hai, jo bacchon par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 Through the poster, people have been told all the ways to be careful with these wild dogs
 hamale ke liye jimmedaar sirf junglee kuteposter ke baad ab is press relies par gaur kiijie
 In this press release issued on May 17, the DM has claimed that only and only wild dogs are responsible for all the incidents of attacks on children in Sitapur district so far
 ye bhedie yaa kisi or jaanavar kaa kaam nahin he
 DM cited the institution with his claim, the District Magistrate has also cited an organization in the press release
 unka kahana he ki wild life institute of india or human sosayadi of india ne ye spasht kiya he ki hamalavar koi or nahin balki junglee kute hai
 a letter has been issued by the organization objecting to the same Human Society of India
 jiskaa zikr jiladhikari ne kiya he
 The very next day after the District Magistrate issued the press release, the Human Society of India wrote a letter to him and expressed his objection, saying that he never said that there are only wild dogs to attack children
 prashasan kii laaparvaahito ab tak to aap samaj hi chuke honge ki sitapur prashasan sandigdh aadamkhor kutton ke maamle kii jaanch kaise kar rahaa he? aap ye bhi jaan gaye honge ki puri takat jhonkne ke baad bhi ab tak yahaan ke logon ko is dehshat se nijaat kyon nahin mil paa rahi?upi police par sawaal?kamaal kii baat to ye he ki ajtak kii team jab sitapur ke alag-alag gaanvon main pahunchi thi, tab hamen vahaan kahin bhi police kii koi team gasht par najar nahin ai
 People had to say that many times even if a dog appeared, people themselves ran away with sticks and sticks behind it
 jabaki police vaale bas logon ke peeche darshak kii tarah khadey the
 However, it may not be right to hold UP police responsible for this
 kahaan peshewar aparaadhiyon se nipatane or unka encounter karne vaali police or kahaan kutton ke peeche bhaagna

 During this time, many people from his village and his department bid him tearful farewell
 hamale main shaamil aatankwaadiyon ne pulicekarmiyon ke hathiyaar le jane se pehle unke chehre vikrut karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Dar's family and friends were preparing for his last visit, the words written by Dar on 18 January 2013 were missing
 unhone likhaa tha,'kya aapane ek pal ke liye bhi rukkar swayan se sawaal kiya kimeri kabr main mere saath pehali ratko kya hoga? us pal ke bare main sochna jab tumhaare shav ko nahalaaya ja rahaa hoga or tumhaari kabr taiyaar kii ja rahi hogi
 'dar wrote on his Facebook wall,' Think of the day when people will be leading you to your grave and your family will be crying
 
 
 us pal ke bare main socho jab tumhen tumhaari kabr main daalaa ja rahaa hoga
 The mortal remains of martyr Feroz Ahmed Dar reached Dogripura, his ancestral village in Pulwama district on Friday

 The villagers had gathered outside his house to pay tribute to Dar

 If the breakup is night then the life ahead is morning, which will remain
 lihaaja yakeen banaae rakhen or 'brallep' kii syah chaaya se khud ko bachaaen
 You don't necessarily get the dream partner so soon
 chil kiijie kyonki brallep ke bhi phaayde hote hai
 Here are 10 advantages: 1: The cleaning of the mind is Guru: The breakup is the clearing of the pot of friends, that in English, it is called 'catharsis'
 man main jamaa purana gaad nikal jaataa he or ek urvar jameen taiyaar hoti he, taaki nae sire se bhaawanaaon kaa udwelan hota he
 The soil after the flood, eg
 2
 Yaari Hai Imaan Mera: Breakup is the departure point after which you understand the importance of your friends from scratch
 lagata he ki aapke dost bahut pyaare hai or ab tak naahak hi aap unki andekhi karte rahe
 The time spent with them increases and planning to roam far away at the hill station is also done
 3
 Get rid of partner-like GPS: Where you are, with whom, when to arrive and at what time will come out, the period of questions is now over
 apana pal-pal kaa haal bataane ke liye aap ab kisi ke prati uttaradaayi nahin hai
 4
 kabj kaa kabja hatega:aap paaenge ki brallep ke baad pet saaf rahane laga he, jo har khushi kii dawa he
 It is such that your stomach no longer has to deal with the outside eating 'unhygienic'
 choumin, pastery, icecream, gol-gappe or chile patato ab aapke raste main nahin aate
 5
 sirf apane jaayke kii filme:uf wo boring filmein
 Thankfully, there is no longer any compulsion to watch his 'test' films
 akele yaa doston ke saath sirf vahi filmein dekhie, jo aapako pasand hai
 6
 rokdaa bachegaa:ab ye koi bataane vaali baat he! baari-bharkam phone bills, mahange restraan kii date, phool-pattee or sarprise gift jaise chonchalon kaa paisa bachataa he
 Your pocket gravity starts to feel
 7
 Wants to join eyes: Uncontrollable, without any hesitation and hesitation, get stuck in the new attraction
 kisi ko pyaar se dekhne ke liye ab pachaas baar sochane kii jarurat nahin he
 You can now write 'how cute' on a girl / boy picture
 saath hi, tamaam partiyon main aapaki puch bhi bad jaati he
 8
 aaraam ajab cheez he:bistar par oonghtey hue ab massej ke riplai karne kii jarurat nahin rahi
 Questions like 'do you miss me' are no longer part of your life
 aaraam ajab cheez he, munh dhank ke soie
 Because if you sleep in time, the risk of black pits falling under the eyes will also be avoided
 9
 The web of books is clear: the breakup comes one night
 jab kuch yaadon ko jhidakate hue aap achaanak mahasoos karte hai ki sirahaane padi ek kitaab se jaala hat gaya he
 Now is enough time to read novels, newspapers, poetry, articles of choice
 phir ilham hota he ki pados ke park main shaam ko kuch ladke footbal bhi khelte hai
 Open the cupboard and take out the sports shoes
 10
 Love thrives for rafi-mukesh: After 'breakup-hee', Mukesh and Rafi's pain-filled nuggets open a new meaning
 ataullah khan ke gane bhi achche lagane lagate hai
 There are some new types of music entry in ipod
 metro kaa safar ab baat karte nahin, kalam sunate hue bitta he
 After the midnight high voltage drama, the first revolt of the Aam Aadmi Party has been resolved

 'kumaar vishwaas or sanjay singh ne vasundhara anchlev main binni ke ghar jaakar unase mulaakaat kii
 After the conversation, the three said that all is well
 party main koi tanaav nahin he
 The three broke the head of the media for the entire controversy
 mujhe shaadi main janaa tha, isliye jaldi niklaa: binnisanjay singh ne kaha, 'yah sab media ne dikhaaya he
 There is no such tension in the party
 ' kumaar vishwaas ne kaha, 'vinod binni ne kabhi nahin kaha ki unhen ministar bananaa he, party main koi baghawat nahin hui he, sab saamaanya he
 Media has spread all the misconceptions
 agar party koi pad unhen detii he to binni faisla lenge ki unhen vah lenaa he yaa nahin
 Vinod Kumar Binny said after doing the drama the whole evening, 'there is no such problem nor am i angry
 kumaar vishwaas or sanjay singh mere bade bhai jaise hai
 We just had a normal conversation that we often have
 shaam main hui baithak main main 10 minute ke liye isliye shaamil hua kyonki mujhe kuch kaam tha

 'binni nahin the naaraaz, unhone pad nahin maanga: kejariwalbuudhvaar subah party daftar main hone vaale janata darbar ke liye ravaanaa hone se pehle arvind kejariwal ne bhi party main kisi tarah kii naaraazgi kaa khandan kiya
 He said, 'he was not angry
 mere paas aae the
 But he did not ask for any position
 baad main unki naaraazgi kii khabaren ain to kumaar or sanjay unase poochne gaye
 But he said that he is not angry
 'AAP ko samarthan par congress main matbhed kii khabaron par puche jane par kejariwal ne kaha ki yah unki samasya he, hamaari nahin
 We are building on government issues
 aapako yaad hoga pehle congress bina shart samarthan de rahi thi or bijepi muddon par samarthan dene ko taiyaar thi
 These are 18 issues for us
 jo vidhayak sahamat he vah samarthan karegaa
 We are not aligned with anyone
 na hi kisi se baatcheet hui he
 All those who want to work for the people of Delhi will support them
 'sarkaar banane ke saath lenge ahm faislekejariwal ne kaha ki unke kuch ahm faisle sarkaar banane ke turant baad le liye jaaenge
 He said that 700 liters of water will be freed within 24 hours, but it will take some time to deliver from door to door
 unhone mana ki 26 taarikh ko unke shapath grahan kii sambhaavna kam hi he kyonki alji kii chitthee ab tak nahin ai he
 When asked if you wanted to take oath on 26, Kejriwal said, '26 i was not wanting you
 media main aayaa tha
 Kejriwal had said that Anna would be invited when the date is fixed
 gauratlab he ki mangalvaar shaam kejariwal cabinet ke sambhavit mantriyon ke naam media main saamne aae
 Vinod Binny met Kejriwal on Tuesday evening after not getting a place in the list of ministers
 donon ke bich 10 minute se bhi kam samay tak baat hui

 gupta ko do saal se bijli kaa conection nahin mila tha kyonki unhone dilli vidyut board ke adhikariyon ko ghoose dene se manaa kar diya tha
 We advised them to apply under the New Delhi's Right to Information (RTI) Act
 dilli sarkaar ne centre sarkaar se chaar saal pehle 2001 main artiai lagu kiya tha
 This was the chance to try the power of RTI
 gupta artiai ke jariye dilli vidyut board ke un adhikariyon ke naam jaananaa chaahate the jo unke aavedan ko dabaakar baithe hue the
 They did not get names, but they got an electrical connection immediately
 isse mujhe pataa chalaa ki nagarikon ke shashaktikaran ke kitne phaayde hai
 i went on long leave and started campaigning vigorously for RTI and quit the government job in February 2006
 is bich, centre ne june, 2005 main artiai kanoon lagu kar diya tha
 Activist Aruna Roy played the most important role in the long-running campaign for RTI across the country
 soochna ke adhikaar ko kanoonee manyata milane ke baad use lagu karne main hamen teen dashak lage
 In 1975, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Rajnarayan v
 State of Uttar Pradesh that the right to information is inherent in the right to expression
 iske baad kai andolan shuru ho gaye
 The first movement started in the early '90s by the mazdoor-kisan Shakti Sangathan to bring transparency in the accounts of villages in Rajasthan under the leadership of Roy
 '90 ke dashak ke madhya main, maharashtra main anna hajaare ne andolan kii aguai kii
 Tamil Nadu was the first state to implement the RTI Act in 1997
 iske baad duusare rajyon ne apana-apana artiai kanoon lagu kiya
 In the form of RTI law, the common people have found a powerful and effective tool
 activist or enjio artiai kaa istemaal sarkaar kii nitiyon or unke karyanvayan par sawaal uthaane ke liye karte rahe hai
 This has rendered the officials sleepless
 sarkaar kaa ab maananaa he ki usne artiai ke rup main apane liye ek badi musiibat khadi kar di he jisase saamaanya shashan kaa kaam baadhit ho rahaa he
 Actually, the authorities are avoiding writing anything on the files and taking decisions
 shuru main ibi, ro, rajasav khufia tathaa pravartan nideshaalay jaisi khufia agenciyon or kendriya police sanghathanon ko hi isse chhot mili hui thi
 But now many other agencies are also demanding to keep themselves out of the purview of this law
 haal main sibiai or iskar vibhaag kii jaanch shakha ko isse chhot mil gai
 Intelligence units can be kept separate from RTI, but not investigation branches at all
 artiai ke paas sarkari agenciyon par chaabuk fatkaarane kii shakti he
 So they are all opposing it
 artiai abhi apni puri kshamta hasil nahin kar paaya he
 The problem is that the Information Commissioner, who is loyal to his political masters, is stumbling in its path
 artiai kanoon apni puri kshamta tabhi hasil kar saktaa he jab tatasth or nishpaksh logon ko soochna ayukta or mukhya soochna ayukta niyukt kiya jaae
 Arvind Kejriwal is one of the leaders of the RTI movement

 This is different from Whats app in many ways, its biggest feature is that it can run without cellular network
 yani jahaan network na bhi ho vahaan yah kaam kar saktaa he
 There is also no need for a wi-fi hotspot for this
 darasal yah har smartphone ko duusare se sidhe judane kaa mauka detaa he
 Messages can be exchanged if any two smartphones (or many) are interconnected
 judane kaa arth he ki ve apane blue tooth yaa vaai-faai radio ke jariye ek-duusare se jud jate hai
 This is far better than whatsapp and in this they form a chain with the help of each other and they start exchanging messages among themselves
 yah app ek local chatteroom kii tarah kaam karata he
 All you have to do is choose a user name
 kisi password kii jarurat nahin he
 Through this you can talk to everyone who is near you
 ab yah suvidha android main bhi uplabdh he
 It has many advantages
 masalan agar aap kisi aisi jagah funs jate hai jaise subway vagairah to vahaan aap maje se sandesh le-de sakate hai
 Similarly you can take advantage of it in places where the network gets jammed
 philhal yah vyavastha kam duuri ke liye he lekin company mesh netwarking technology ke jariye ise dur tak pahunchane kii koshish kar rahi he
 In this technology, a complete network can be made using every phone as a message sender medium

 Every phone will act like a tower
 isaki ek or khubi he

 When India test-fired the Agni-5 missile, the influential newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, Global Times, said that India should not over-estimate its strength
 yadhyapi uske paas aisi misile hai jo china ke adhikansh hisson tak pahunch sakati hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki use china ke saath vivaad ke dauraan ahamkaari hone se koi laabh milegaa
 The daily, known for its attacks on countries with disputes with China, said that India should make it clear that China's nuclear power is stronger and more reliable
 ‘india beeing swept awe bai military dilugen’ shishark vaale sampadakeey main akhbaar ne kaha he ki bharat ke paas nikat bhavishya ke liye koi avasar nahin hoga
 It said that India should not even overestimate the importance of its Western allies and it can benefit by exercising restraint with China
 yadi yah china kii kshamta ke saath lambii duuri kii samrik mixilon se barabari karata he or dushmani ko aage badhaata he to yah uski badi galati ho sakati he
 The newspaper said that India has advanced rapidly in the development of missile technology
 akhbaar ne kaha ki isane (bharat) pichley saal 3500 kilometre kii duuri tak maar karne vaali agni-4 kaa safal pareekshan kiya tha
 The Indian public has long been seeing China as its reference point for its military development
 sampadakeey main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki aisa prathit hota he ki bharat ko apni sainya takat badhaane ke maarg main bahut si baadhaon kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa he
 India is still poor and far behind in building infrastructure, but its society is a strong supporter of the development of nuclear power and ignores the violation of nuclear and missile control treaties by Western India
 akhbaar ne is saal china ke khud ke 106 arab america dollar ke raksha bajet kaa ullekh kiye bina kaha he ki pashchim is tathy par khamosh rahata he ki bharat kii sena 2012 main raksha bajet par 17 pratishat adhik kharch kar rahi he or desh vishwa main phir se hathiyaaron kaa sabase bada ayatak ban gaya he
 The Global Times stated in its editorial that China and India should develop friendly relations as far as possible
 yadi yah hasil nahin ho, tab bhi donon ko ek
 
 duusare ke prati sahishnu hona chahie tathaa sah astitv apnaanaa chahie
 It said that their status as new emerging powers suggests that both should cooperate on the international stage
 china or bharat ke liye mixilon kaa vikaas kar shakti santulan ke bare main sochna avivekpurna hoga
 The newspaper said that the geopolitical situation of Asia is China

 The infighting in the Punjab unit of the Congress Party is at a peak over poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri or congress kaaryakarini samiti ke sadsy captain amarinder singh ne aarope lagaaya ki pradesh congress ke adhyaksh pratap singh bajva or unke bhai fateh bajva ne amritsar main unke chunaav prachaar main baadha daalane kii koshish kii thi or shahar kaa daura karke logon ko unka virodh karne ko kaha tha
 Amarinder, who was elected MP from Amritsar, said that in this order he had called Fateh and warned him against tampering with his propaganda in Amritsar
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki vah party hit main abhi tak chup rahe the, lekin kuch netaaon ko bina kaaran nishaanaa banaae jane or koi galati na hone ke baavjood aaropee banaae jane ke kaaran unako ab yah khulaasa karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa he
 He has questioned the disciplinary action committee chairman GK Chatrath whether he will take any action against the state Congress president and his brother for this act
 captain amarinder kaa aarope he ki chunaav prachaar ke dauraan donon bajva bhai amritsar aae the or unhone logon se unka virodh karne yaa phir kam se kam samarthan na karne ko kaha tha
 When he came to know about this, he called Fateh Bajwa at the same time and asked the two brothers to keep distance from Amritsar
 unhone kaha ki yah donon bhai zyada samay amritsar main rahe
 Fateh said that he is resting while his brother is in Gurdaspur, who was actually in Amritsar
 captain amarinder ne pradesh congress cameti main anushaasan lagu karne sambandhi daawey karne vaale chatarath par bhi chutki lete hue sawaal kiya he ki kya vah bajva bhaaiyon par bhi aisi karrwai karenge, jo unhone do pisisi upaadhyakshon par karne kii koshish kii thi
 The former chief minister of the state advised Chatrath not to refrain from arguing as to why he did not resign as chief minister in 2004 after two seats in Punjab
 is kram main sabase pehali baat bataur anushaasanamak karrwai cameti ke chairman vah aise sawaal karke khud party nahin ban sakate, jo kadam un par baari pad sakate hai
 Secondly, how can Chatrath know what happened after the 2004 results and what happened between him (captain Amarinder) and Congress President Sonia Gandhi? captain amarinder ne kaha ki chatarath ke shabd or harakatein safataur par darsha rahe hai ki vah kiske ishaare par chal rahe hai
 He should stick to his words, until it is proved wrong
 ujjain ko puraanon main mangal kii janani kaha jaataa he
 Such people whose Mars is heavily in the horoscope, they come to worship in Mangalnath temple for the peace of their evil planets
 mangal dosha ek aisi sthiti he, jo jis kisi jataka kii kundali main ban jaye to use badi hi ajeebogareeb paristhiti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, mangal dosha kundali ke kisi bhi ghar main sthit ashubh mangal ke dwaara banaae jane vaale dosha ko kehete hai, jo kundali main apni sthiti or bal ke chalate jataka ke jivan ke vibhinn kshetron main samasyaayein utpann kar saktaa he
 Mangal Dosh is completely based on the position of the planets
 vaidic jyotish ke anusaar yadi kisi jataka ke janm chakra ke pehle, chauthe, saatven, aathven or barahawein ghar main mangal ho to aisi sthiti main paidaa hua jataka mangalik kaha jaataa he
 This situation is considered extremely inauspicious for marriage
 sambandho main tanaav va bikharaav, ghar main koi anhoni va apriy ghatana, kaary main bevajaah baadha or asuvidha tathaa kisi bhi prakaar kii kshati or dampatti kii asamayik mrityu kaa kaaran mangalik dosha ko mana jaataa he
 According to astrology, one Manglik should marry another Manglik
 yadi var or vadhu mangalik hote he to donon ke mangal dosha ek duusare se ke yoga se samaapt ho jate he
 Originally according to the nature of Mars, such a planetary yoga shows harmful effects, but through Vedic worship process can control its horrors
 mangal grah kii puja ke dwaara mangal dev ko prasann kiya jaataa he, tathaa mangal dwaara janit vinaashkari prabhaavon ko shant va niyantrit kar sakaaratmak prabhaavon main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 Such people whose Mars is heavily in the horoscope, they come to worship in Mangalnath temple for the peace of their evil planets, because in the Puranas, the city of Ujjain has been called the mother of Mars
 puure bharat se log yahaan par aakar mangal dev kii puja aradhana karte hai, jinaki kundali main mangal baari hota he vah mangal shanti hetu yahan bhaat puja karavaate hai

 'AAP' leader Somnath Bharti said that 'when we had the government and the ACB was in our hands then we also got the FIR done and took swift action in the matter but when Delhi had one year of President's rule and one year when the ACB was not in our hands Then for two whole years no action was taken in these cases, so LG and Mukesh Meena should be made co-accused in these cases
 " LG was against getting an FIR against itself and ACB Chief Mukesh Meena for getting an FIR against him
 
 
 or ye baat aam aadmi party bhi jaanati he lekin vah is maang ke zariye yah sandesh dena chaahati hai ki jab 11 maheene tak tanker ghotaale main karrwai na karne ke aarope main kejariwal sarkaar par FIR ho sakati he to phir 2 saal tak shila dikshit or mukesh ambani samet anya aropiyon par karrwai naakarne par alji najeeb jang or asibi pramukh mukesh meena ke khilaaf FIR kyon nahin ho sakati?

 tippaniyan a delegation of 12 Aam Aadmi Party mlas reached the LG Secretariat to meet the LG but due to non-scheduled time of meeting, the LG did not talk to the AAP mlas but their secretary took up the complaint

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani advised him not to use words like 'deception and deceit' on the criticism made by the state Chief Minister Omar Abdullah demanding his abolition of special status of Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone spasht kiya ki unki party hameshaa se anuchhed 370 kii virdohi rahi he
 In his latest blog posting, he said, even the Congress party was strongly opposed to giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir except Jawaharlal Nehru and some other leaders

" lekin main unhen salaah duungaa ki vah kabhi bhi aakraamak bhashaa or ‘dhokhe yaa chal’ jaise shabdon kaa istemaal nahin karen

 He said, Abdullah should have known that the Jana Sangh was not even established when Jammu and Kashmir was accorded special state status

 is mudde par bhaajapa ke rukh ke liye ‘dhokhe’ or ‘chal’ jaise shabdon ke istemaal ko ‘atyadhik anuchit or apmanjanak’ bataate hue adwani ne kaha ki unki party 1951 main jansangh ke janm ke samay se ab tak ‘na keval spashtvaadi or atal rahi he, balki uske liye yah ek aisa mudda he jiske liye party ke sansthaapak adhyaksh ne apane praanon kaa balidaan diya
 ' jansangh ke sansthaapak shyama prasad mukherjee ko 1952 main jammu kashmir main us samay giraftaar kar liya gaya tha jab unhone permit ke bina rajya main ghusane kii koshish kii jo us samay vahaan jane ke liye jaruri hota tha
 He was reportedly killed under mysterious circumstances while imprisoned
 adwani ne kaha, ‘‘kanpur main apane sabase pehle akhil bhartiya satr ke samay se ham bharat main jammu-kashmir ke purna ekikaran kii maang karte rahe hai
 He said, Abdullah should have known that the Jana Sangh was not even established when Jammu and Kashmir was accorded special state status
 bhaajapa netaa ne kaha, ‘‘haalanki, samvidhan kaa masauda taiyaar karne main agar aisa koi praavdhaan tha jiske khilaaf lagbhag samoochee congress party thi to vah yah praavdhaan tha
 He said, "the issue was considered by the Constituent Assembly in 1949 only two months before the constitution was fully accepted
 ’’ The Congress and Abdullah's National Conference are coalition partners at the state and center
 sardaar patel ke nijee sachiv ve shankar dwaara likhi gai pustak ‘maai remanisans of sardaar patel’ ke hawaale se adwani ne kaha ki nehru ne videsh yatra par jane se pehle umr abdulla ke dada shaikh abdulla ke saath milakar masaude ko antim rup diya tha
 The comments nehru ne congress sansadeey dal ke samaksh iskaa bachaav karne ke liye ise apane saathi congress netaa gopalswami ayangar par chhod diya
 He said that Sardar Patel was against this idea but later he moved forward on it
 haalanki, congress sadasyon ke kade virodh par, jo ki is mudde par moulana aaazaad tak par chillaaye, patel ne kaha ‘‘antarrashtriya jatiltaaon’’ ke kaaran keval ek asthai drushtikon banaaya ja saktaa he
 Advani, referring to the autobiography of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, said that even he was against Article 370, but due to Nehru's respect, he held back his views
 adwani ne apane blog main kaha, ‘‘rajya ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ko jammu-kashmir se sambandhit maamalon par bhaajapa se asahmat hone kaa puraa adhikaar he
 But i would advise him never to use offensive language and words like 'deception or deceit'
 ’’ Advani recently said that Article 370 should be abolished
 abdulla ne is par adwani kaa naam liye bina ‘‘bevajaah nirastikaran kaa mudda oochhaalane’’ ke liye unki ninda kii thi
 Describing the use of words like 'deception' and 'deceit' as 'highly inappropriate and derogatory' for the bjp's stand on the issue, Advani said that his party was not only articulate and adamant since the birth of the Jana Sangh in 1951
 It is an issue for which the founder president of the party sacrificed his life
 ’ Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was arrested in 1952 in Jammu and Kashmir when he tried to enter the state without a permit which was required to go there at that time
 kaid ke dauraan unki kathith taur par rahasyamay paristhitiyon main maut ho gai thi
 "from the time of our first all-india session in Kanpur, we have been demanding full integration of Jammu and Kashmir in India," Advani said
 ’’ unhone kaha, abdulla ko pataa hona chahie ki jab jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja diya gaya tha to tab jansangh kii sthapana bhi nahin hui thi
 The BJP leader said, "however, if there was any provision in drafting the constitution against which almost the entire Congress party was there, it was that provision
" ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘samvidhan ko purna rup se sweekaar karne se keval do maheene pehle is mudde par samvidhan sabha ne 1949 main vichaar kiya tha
 '' congress or abdulla kii neshnal conference rajya tathaa centre main gathbandhan sahyogi hai
 Referring to the book 'my Reminiscences of Sardar Patel' written by Sardar Patel's personal secretary v Shankar, Advani said that Nehru had finalized the draft with Omar Abdullah's grandfather Sheikh Abdullah before going on a foreign trip
 tippaniyan Nehru left it to his fellow Congress leader Gopalaswami Iyengar to defend it before the Congress Parliamentary Party
 unhone kaha ki sardaar patel is vichaar ke viruddh the lekin baad main vah is par aage bade
 However, on the stiff opposition from Congress members who shouted down even Maulana Azad on the issue, Patel said that "a temporary approach can only be made due to" international complications "
