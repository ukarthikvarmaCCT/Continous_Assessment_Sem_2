 Amid the political attacks of tampering with evms, the Election Commission has once again claimed that such allegations are baseless and clearly stated that no tampering with evms is possible
 ayog iviem ke samarthan main khulkar saamne aayaa he
 The Election Commission will challenge the EVM to prove tampering in the first week of May after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal repeatedly questioned the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)
 yah chunauti 10 din tak khuli rahegi
 During this time there will be an open challenge to do three to four level tampering in evms
 yahi nahin chunaav ayog iviem mashin kholkar bhi usamen chhedchhad karne kii chunauti de saktaa he
 The Election Commission says that even in 2009, after the ownership of EVM was questioned, we gave open challenge but no one could prove it
 (ek aisi mashin jisase EVM par shaq karne kii koi gunjaaish nahin rahegi baaki) There are reports quoting Election Commission sources that the commission will call representatives of political parties in this 'open challenge'

 Kejriwal had claimed that about 20 to 25 per cent of the votes of AAP were probably 'gone' to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) -BJP alliance

 prem ke vishay par sabane bahut likhaa padhaa he
 
 premi - premika par bhi kaaphi kuch likhaa gaya he, lekin prem patr ke bare main kaaphi kam yaa kuch bhi nahin likhaa gaya
 After all, why did a love letter be needed? 
 At a time when words were not invented properly
 
 
 or aaj ke jamaane main jab har baat kehane ke liye phone, miseging eps hai
 
 
 Why is writing still so important? 
 When we can meet easily
 
 
 kabhi bhi phone kar sakate hai tab bhi kyon chat (modern prem patr) sab par baari he?shuruyaat se shuru karte hai
 
 wo jamaana jab sanchaar kaa akelaa madhyam patr hi tha
 
 tab is prem patr kaa avishkaar hua hoga
 
 
 At a time when thinking was not so modern
 
 
 kahin par bhi milanaa julna mumkin nahin tha
 
 isliye dil ke ubharate jajbaton ko baahar nikaalane ke liye is patr kaa sahaara liya gaya hoga
 
 kyonki ye prem se labarej tha isliye patr ke pehle prem jod diya gaya
 
 
 Further, the meanings of words continued to come out
 
 Prem paati, first letter of love and no one knows what! Ali Sardar Jafri: The poet who had to go to jail after independence
 
 
 to ye to rahi wo vajah jisane prem patr kaa avishkaar kiya
 
 ab kyon sadiyon ke biit jane ke baavjood iskaa astitv khatm nahin hua
 
 
 Why people kept saving it, why they kept engraving everything in the heart, in fact, the first thing was not having courage, despite proposing in front, did not have the courage to listen, so write everything in the letter in your heart It seemed easy and he was happy to give it to his lover with all his feelings
 
 
 
 Why to write now? 
 
 
 The reason for this must have been interesting
 
 When we say, the person in front often does not like to listen
 
 He brings his questions in between, the words spoken by the feelings inside you also remain suppressed
 jis veg se aap kahana chaahate hai usee veg se saamne vaala unhen dabaa detaa he
 
 yahaan prem kii paakhi main aap likhte ho
 
 har baat kah dete ho
 
 
 There is no stopping
 
 Say whatever you want to say
 
 Do you write again? 
 
 munh se kahe gaye shabd waapas nahin aate lekin yahaan kai dfa jaanchate ho
 
 
 But it all depends on the patience of the hearer
 
 Maybe he is a good listener and can listen to your love proposal with full patience
 lekin prem patr kaa aglaa kaary sabaki ummiido se pare hota he
 
 
 What will i do if you leave tomorrow? 
 
 gaate-gaate udhaas kar gaye mohammad ajijaprem patr jab saamne vaale ke paas pahunchataa he to wo ise padhata he
 
 
 many times 
 
 Again

 The words of a lover or girlfriend go down in his heart
 
 
 uski bhavanaaen vahaan tak pahunch jaati hai jahaan tak wo unhen pahunchaana chahta he
 
 to yahi he prem patr kaa swarup
 
 yaheen se udai hua or iske baad inako sambhaal kar rakhana inamen gulab bhejnaa , itr chhidakna to inke badlaav kaa gavaah rahaa he
 
 lekin mahake honge jab bhi kabhi to shabd hi mahake honge
 
 
 Paper, smells, or flowers have wilted in it
 
 
 ab ise kuch bhi samaj sakate hai
 
 kisi kaa pehla prem patr yaa kuch or bas sachai yahi he ki log kuch alag rup main hi bahut kuch likhnaa chahta hai jo shaayad patr ke madhyam se behtareen tareeke se likhaa jaataa he
 
 
 No one will ever meet but feelings and waiting always remain
 
 
 jise kehane ke liye prem patr se behatar kuch nahin

 The police cannot even sit with their hands on, and no one knew when the lover fell
 par koshish to kerani hi thi
 So, at first the police heard and understood the whole story

 It was the craze of that crazy lover that if he gets married, then only he will not live with this girl or he will not let the girl live

 The girl was to be imprisoned that there was panic in this Gold City Fortune Society of Misrod area

 He wanted to say something with a hint, but his gestures were not understood by anyone

 The police are afraid that if strictures are taken against her, she may not shoot at the girl and her family members
 lihaaza police is maamle main bahut ehtiyaat barat rahi he
 Accused Rohit told the police that i will not open the door till my father comes
 or bhopal kii police ko bhi dekhie ki wo subah se lekar raat tak rohit ke papa kaa hi intazaar karti he
 Meanwhile, according to his request, he kept getting things done

 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said that why the BJP government of Maharashtra is not taking action on the murder of Pansare and Dabolkar? He said, it is ironic that Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad talked about the murder of Kalburgi but why he kept silent on the killing of Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar
 surajevaala ne kaha ki desh ke kanoon mantri ne yah kyon nahin bataaya ki in teenon tarkwaadiyon kii hatya ke sanshay ke taar kathith taur par maharashtra sthit sanathan santhaan se jude hai or inke khilaaf bijepi sarkaar koi karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Journalist asked the Congress to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Gauri Lankeshki murder case
 
 
 1
 Why has Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept silence over the assassination of Gauri Lankesh? 2
 gauri lankesh kii hatya par sharmnaak tareeke se jo vyakti jashn manaa rahe hai aise logon ko pradhanmantri twitor par follow kyon karte hai?3
 Does BJP agree with the statement of its Karnataka MLA Jeevaraj that Gauri Lankesh would not have been killed if she had not written articles against RSS or BJP? 4
 bijepi gauri lankesh ko naksalwadiyon se jude hone kii bebuniya baat kis aadhaar par kah rahi he?5
 Is it not true that Gauri Lankesh was repeatedly writing against the divisive agenda of BJP? It is noteworthy that after the assassination of senior journalist Gauri Lankeshki in Bangalore, this issue is constantly being politicized
 karnataka ke bijepi netaa or purv mantri jivraj ne kaha ki agar gauri lankesh rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke logon kii maut ke jashn ke bare main naa likhti to shaayad aaj jinda hotin

 jitendra ke mutabik pintu pichley 2 varshon se avaidh tareeke se sharaab bech rahaa tha or iske bare main ilaake main sabko pataa tha
 Jitendra has alleged that the police used to take weeks from Pintu for this
 jitendra kaa ye bhi kahana he ki pintu ko cancer tha or wo kisi terahavin ke kaarykram main baloopur nahin gaya tha
 a person from the nearby area used to supply liquor to him and this liquor also came from there
 zahreeli sharaab pine se pintu sahit uske parivaar ke paanch logon kii bhi maut hui he
 In such a situation, is the police trying to protect itself by referring alcohol to another state
 haalanki alok pandeya kaa kahana he ki sharaab padosi rajya ke gyaan singh ke yanha se hi laai gai thi
 But both have died
 aise main koun sahi kah rahaa he or koun galat ye to jaanch ke baad hi saaf hoga, lekin alok pandeya ne baatcheet main mana ki unase chook hui he
 And it is being tried to make up for this mistake

 If you are fond of reading and, incidentally, tell a new techno-friendly writer that his book has been published, what would you say? Not that, give your book
 badale main kitaab kii bajaae ek ap downlod karne kii salaah mili to? phir yahi andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki uskaa vaasta yuva technosaivi publisher chiki sarkaar ke phone publicing ke kisi upkram se hoga
 This concept is relatively new in India
 desh main ise laane vaali sarkaar kahati hai, ''aaj bharat main sabase zyada smart phone yujar hai, pathak smart hota ja rahaa he to publishars ko bhi paaramparik tareekon se aage baduya chahie
 When shopping can be done on the phone, movies can be watched, CCTV can be monitored, apps on the phone can show the way, then why can't a book be published or read on the phone? "india is a country where People spend the most time on the phone
 isliye lekhakon-pathakon, donon ke liye phone publicing kaa concept kai nae maukey or vikalp uplabdh kara saktaa he
 In the words of the government, "it does not mean that people will not read books or their importance will be reduced
" matlab itnaa-sa he ki publicing kii duniya main ek nae tarah kaa prayog hoga
 We will run both methods in parallel
 kitaab kharidte vakt aap apni ruchi se chunate hai
 On the phone too, you will read what pleases your mind
 fark itnaa-sa he ki phone publisher ap par aap sabsakrib karne ke saath hi anasbskrib karne ke liye aaazaad hai
 It is very handy for the reader, so the publisher needs to run a publishing house with less resources
 aap duniya ke kisi bhi kone main baithkar koi bhi kitaab pard sakate hai
 Sarkar Publications Juggernaut Publishers has started printing books in both English and Hindi languages
 jagarnott ap main bhi inhen bhashaaon main kitaaben uplabdh hai
 Chick Sarkar laid the foundation of the publishing house in 2015 and soon made a unique and new experiment in this world
 unhone 22 april, 2016 ko phone publicing jaise concept ko saakaar kar diya or hindi ke pathakon ko padhgaye kaa nayaa madhyam muhaiyaa karaayaa
 E-book stores like Kindle are being well liked in India
 lekin jagarnott ne i-book yaa i-librari se bhi ek kadam aage kitabon ko phone par publish karne kii ore kadam badhaayaa he
 For this, internet is not necessary all the time on the reader's phone
 kisse-kahani yaa kisi bhi kitaab ko ek baar downlod karke aap ofline use padhgaye kaa lutf uthaa sakate hai
 The biggest advantage of being a phone publisher is that if you want to publish a story in a series, it can be done easily
 chiki sarkaar kahati hai ki phone publicing van divaais main tabdeel hote bharat ke pathakon or lekhakon ke liye behad rochak kadam he
 She wants India to step in with other countries even in the world of publishing
 poochne par ki kya ab paaramparik publicing house ke mukaable jagarnott kaa jor phone publicing par hoga
 "it's not like that at all," she says
 hamaare teen pramukh makasad haih pehla, zyada se zyada deshavaasiyon ko padhgaye ke liye kitaaben muhaiyaa karana
 The second is to inspire more and more Indians to write
 teesraa makasad he likhi gai saamagree ko rochak or sahaj bananaa he
 We are trying to do all these things through both mediums
 "ek taraf jagarnott se 5,500 kitaaben prakashit ho chuki hai
 All of them are published from traditional publishing houses
 haalanki isamen hindi kitabon kii sankhya takreeban 600 hi he
 The encouraging thing is that people are also fond of phone publishing
 ab tak iske jariye 10 lakh log alag-alag content ko downlod kar chuke hai
 Many books are best selling, including Twinkle Khanna's book
 aise main jagarnott print kii apni pahchaan ko or thos karata hua apane digital avatar par kaam karegaa
 a confident Chick Sarkar was asked why he made a career like publishing his career? She says, "the atmosphere of the house has always been read-write
 kitabon ke bich hi main pali-badi
 There is a scent of books in my blood

 ve kahati hai, ''bharat or euke kii publicing industry main bada antar he
 Indian publishers do not depend on agents for books

 But there is a lot of potential in this area

 "the government has started a challenge but now what are their plans for the future? What does the business plan ahead say?" We plan to partner with many ventures like Rail Passenger and Make My Trip Are making hamaara sabsakripshan kaise bade, is disha main ham kaam kar rahe hai

 Meanwhile, the Delhi government also told the Supreme Court that the decision of the Delhi High Court has been challenged

 supreme court kaa kahana tha ki chunki isi maamle par dilli hoicourt faisla suna chuki he, so, aage badhane ke liye uske faisle ko chunauti di jaani chahie, or alag se yachika kaa koi auchity nahin he, kyonki do maamle ek saath nahin chal sakate
 In fact, the Delhi High Court, in its decision, gave a shock to the Delhi government, saying that the Lieutenant Governor is the administrator of Delhi
 vaise, samvidhan main praavdhaan 131 ke tahat vyavastha kii gai he ki yadi centre or rajya yaa rajyon ke bich koi vivaad ho, to supreme court hi sunwaayee kar saktaa he

 The Supreme Court held that since the Delhi High Court has ruled on the same matter, its decision should be challenged to move forward, and there is no justification for a separate petition as the two cases cannot run simultaneously
 darasal, dilli hoicourt ne apane faisle main dilli sarkaar ko jhatka dete hue kaha tha ki uparajyapal hi dilli ke prashaasak hai

 unhone raay di ki 543 sadasyeey loksabhaa main congress ke paas apekshit 10 fisadi, yani 55 siten nahin hai
 The Congress has just 44 seats in the Lok Sabha, which is insufficient

 maanav or pashuon ke mel main uplabdh jeevanu- maleey coliform (fecal coliform) kii maatra sipisibi ke nishkarshon ke mukaable 30 pratishat bad chuki he
 In view of this dangerous level of fecal coliform, it can be estimated that thousands of liters of contaminated sewer water containing human and animal feces in the river water is being released daily without being cleaned
 yamuna kinare purvi va dakshin dilli main ugaai jane vaali subjiyon main ucch maatra main dhaatu saamagree or maleey padaarth hote hai jinhen khaane se pet kii gambhir samasyaayein ho sakati hai

 2 crore
 isse pehle sipisibi kii jaanch main yah 57 lakh or 30 lakh prati 100 mili litre paayi gai thi
 The fecal coliform comes from the sewer and the sewer is discharged directly into the Yamuna
 zyaadaatar logon ko to is baat jaankaree bhi nahin he ki isse unki sehat par kitna bura asar padataa he
 Not only this, in most of the places in the water of Yamuna, oxygen was found to be zero, which means that no organism can survive in this water

 Apart from this, Yamuna water is no longer better than sewer water in any case
 yamuna ke isi pani ko subjiyan va fal ugane, mandiyon main subjiyan dhone ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jahaan se inhen shahar ke anya hisson main bechney ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Vegetables grown in Yamuna water are being traded indiscriminately
 udhaaharan ke liye okhla mandi main aane vaali subjiyan or or fal okhla bairaj ke aasapaas or wazirabad main yamuna nadi ke paas ugaai jane vaali subjiyan ajadpur mandi main bikati hai
 The fecal material increases with sewer water and sewer water from various areas of Delhi is released directly into the Yamuna
 toxix link ke sansthaapak ravi agarwal kehete hai ki maleey saamagree nizamuddin pul ke baad shikhar par pahunch jate hai
 Vegetables grown from here to Okhla Mandi are sold in markets in South Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon

 Green leafy vegetables should be cooked repeatedly and avoid eating raw vegetables
 yahaan tak ki purvi dilli main bik rahe amaruud or saljam ko bhi yamuna ke pani main dhoyaa ja rahaa he

 Taking cognizance of the problems arising out of pollution and parking in Delhi, the Supreme Court has ordered the Central Government to seal the big showrooms, shops and restaurants in the capital, which are operating by following the rules
 avaidh jhuggi-jhopadiyon or chote bazaaron ko ye kah kar raahat de di gai he ki unke paas duusare vikalp nahin hai
 After this order there is anger in Delhi's business, traders are unhappy with the discrimination they themselves are subjected to
 khan market association ke adhyaksh sanjeev mehara kaa kahana he, 'ham mananeey court ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai, par ek baat jo ham sabhi vyapaariyon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he, wo he ki ye bhedbhaav kyon, agar kisi ne bhi avaidh nirmaan kiya he yaa koi galati kii he to sabhi ko samaan sajaa milani chahie
 What is wrong is wrong, so why are we being targeted
 'is faisle se sabase zyada aahtadillike lajpat nagar se sate amar colony market ke vyapaaree hai
 Here the biggest ceiling of Delhi has been executed so far
 yahaan chote se kiraane kii dukaan se lekar kapadon ke showrooms ko puri tarahsil kar diyagaya he
 Even doctor's clinics and coaching centers were not abandoned
 court ne dilli ke rihaayshi ilaakon main chal rahi badi dukaanon, showrooms or restaurant ko sil karne kaa aadesh diya he
 To what extent this decision will help Delhi get rid of the problem of pollution and parking, it will tell the time to come, but in the current situation, traders are feeling cheated themselves and are appealing to the court not to favor them

 Where is the matter stuck? The Rajasthan government had given five percent reservation to Gurjars by creating a separate category of special backward classes
 lekin rajya main kul aarakshan kii seemaa 50 fisadi se zyada hone kii vajah se hoicourt ne faisle par roak laga di thi
 After this, the Rajasthan government has gone to the Supreme Court against the decision of the High Court on the demand of Gurjars

 After this, the Gurjar society in Rajasthan has been excluded from the reservation of special backward classes

 There has been a fight on this issue in the past as well, on the issue of canal excavation, we had not allowed water before
 agar punjab se pani gaya to punjab main maute ho jaaegi
 The entire economy of Punjab is dependent on water
 punjab ke khilaaf thi indirasupreme court ke pani dene ke aadesh par badal ne kaha ki hamaari party desh ke liye ladaai ladati ai he, immergency main bhi hamane ladaai ladi
 Indira Gandhi did the wrong thing by getting a compromise, she had no right, she was against Punjab
 congress netaa amarinder singh ke istipha dene par badal ne kaha ki yah congress kaa drama he, naa hi amarinder singh ne or naa hi congress ne punjab ke liye ladaai ladi he, vah chaahate he ham bhi istipha den lekin hamaari sarkaar istipha nahin degi
 On the statement of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Badal said that he is our brother, we are not against him, we are fighting for our right

 manoj tiwari kehete hai hamen milakar kaam karnaa he or jo faisle lene hai, wo sabaki sahmati se lenge
 Surprisingly, Manoj Tiwari himself was not in Delhi when the Tiwari-led team was announced

 darasal dilli bijepi kii nai team main jo chehre aae hai, unako lekarparty ke duusare netaa bhi hairaan hai
 Surprisingly, the close of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has also been sidelined, while the presence of Arun Jaitley's close associates in the organization has always been there

 Not only this, according to sources, this time 9 ministers have been made in the team instead of eight state ministers, the news is that two more names will be added to this list
 pradesh adhyakshamanoj tiwari bhi purvanchal se aate hai, iske baavjood mahila morche kii adhyaksh punam parashar ko niyukt kiya gaya
 However, according to Poonam Parashar, she will leave no stone unturned to surround the Kejriwal government if she does not fulfill the promises made to women
 party ke nae mahaamantri kulajit chahal kehete hai ki party main koi gutbaji nahin he, manoj tiwari ek kaabil adhyaksh hai or unki aguai main nai yuva team puure josh ke saath kaam karegi
 Party General Secretary Ravindra Gupta is describing the new team as strong for MCD elections
 unhone kaha kitiwari ne jo team chuni he, wo emsidi chunaav ke liye ek majboot team he, jo kejariwal ke karnaamon ko ujagar karegi
 Although there was no open opposition in the BJP after the announcement of the team, but the leaders have not only expressed their resentment in front of the party high command but also have not held back from calling the new team a weak team
 up-captain rohit sharma ne guruuvar ko kaha ki bharat kii vishwa cap team lagbhag sunishchit ho gai he, lekin kisi ko bhi apane sthaan ko lekar aashwast nahin hona chahie, kyonki kharaab form se koi bhi baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 Rohit said that the team that will participate in the upcoming ODI series in Australia and New Zealand, may have one or two changes which will depend on the poor form and injuries in the coming months
 rohit ne kaha, ‘jo team in 13 vanade main khelegi, vah lagbhag vahi team hogi jo vishwa cap main jaaegi
 This may result in one or two changes due to form or concerns of injuries in the next few months
 ’bharat aegi australia, 24 farvari se bengularu main tii-20 siries kaa aagaazunhone kaha, ‘hamane puure saal main kaaphi cricket khelaa isliye chotein to lagengi hin
 There will also be some concerns regarding form and fitness
 mujhe nahin lagata ki team koi bada badlaav hoga
 Talking about the place in the playing XI, he said, 'the venue has also been decided by almost all the players, but in saying this, i think everything will depend on the form of each player

" toornament ke bich ke hisse ke liye team kaa aatmavishvaas se bhare rahanaa kaaphi ahm he kyonki yaheen se aap finels ke liye apni raah tay kar sakate ho
 He said, "surely there will be a shortage of three important players in the team, so the responsibility will be on me, Sehwag and Venugopal

 Due to this, the budget of the people is deteriorating, Komal, who came to shop in the market, said that the vegetable is three times the price, potatoes can not take anything 40 rupees, Kanda 30 rupees
 vahiin bhavesh kaa kahana tha, 'bahut thodaa liya he, main koparkhayrane se sanpada aayaa hum, yahaan bhi sabzi acchhee nahin he, tamaato 80 rupee he, quality bhi acchhee nahin he
 Comments maharashtra main 1977 main bazaar samitiyaan bani thim, jisase kareeb ek lakh log sidhe vahiin 3-4 lakh paroksh rup se rozi kamaate hai
 Traders say that 30 per cent of the produce comes directly in the wholesale market, 70 per cent is purchased and procured, so the allegations of robbing farmers or customers are baseless
 apiemasi main har saal lagbhag 15000 karod rupee kaa kaarobaar hota he, jis par zyaadaatar ensipi ko samarthan dene vaale kaarobaariyon kaa niyantran he
 However, it is also true that the decision to delist the fruits and vegetables was taken during the UPA government itself, which the BJP is implementing in the states under its rule to benefit the customers and farmers
 aise main ek baat yaad rakhane vaali he ki sabji kaa siyaasi bhav sarkarein ukhaad phenkane kii takat rakhti hai

 The APMC has a turnover of about Rs
15000 crores every year, which is mostly controlled by the businessmen supporting NCP

 In such a situation, one thing to remember is that the political sense of the vegetable has the power to overthrow the governments

 Electoral bonds were introduced to make electoral funding transparent
 Electoral bonds have been under question and controversy since the beginning of last year
 Due to secrecy in these bonds, the possibility of misuse by corporates made it possible to get money from abroad, while the Election Commission This is why the bonds of electoral bonds, ie electoral donations, have once again come under discussion and controversy
 soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat jaankaree se yah khulaasa hua he ki rigerv bank ne elactoral bond jari karne ko lekar sarkaar ko chetaya tha or sarkaar ne rigerv bank kii salaah ko darkinar kar ise shuru kiya
 After all, what are these electoral bonds and why there has been controversy from time to time about this, let us understand in detail
 ise bhi padhein: elactoral bond: RBI kii chitthee ko lekar congress ne modi sarkaar ko gheraakya hote hai elactoral bondsarkaar ne is daawey ke saath saal 2018 main is bond kii shuruyaat kii thi ki isse raajnneetik funding main paardarshita badhegi or saaf-suthra dhan aayega
 In this, individuals, corporates and institutions buy bonds and give them to political parties in the form of donations and political parties get cash by cashing this bond in the bank
 bhartiya state bank kii 29 shakhaon ko elactoral bond jari karne or use bhunaane ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya
 These branches are from New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Gandhinagar, Chandigarh, Patna, Ranchi, Guwahati, Bhopal, Jaipur and Bengaluru
 ab tak elactoral bond kii bikri ke 12 charan puure ho chuke hai
 30 of the highest of electoral bonds
 67 fisadi hissaa mumbai main bechaa gaya
 80 of them is the highest
 50 fisadi hissaa dilli main bhunaaya gaya
 Why the Electoral Bond was issued The government introduced electoral bonds last year to improve the electoral funding system
 2 janvari, 2018 ko tatkaaleen modi sarkaar ne elactoral bond skim ko adhishuchet kiya tha
 The Electoral Bonds were introduced by the Finance Act 2017
 yah bond saal main chaar baar janvari, april, july or oktober main jari kiye jate hai
 For this, the customer can buy it by going to the bank branch or online on its website
 kya he elactoral bond kii khubikoi bhi donor apni pahchaan chhupate hue state bank of india se ek karod rupye tak mulya ke elactoral bonds kharid kar apni pasand ke raajnneetik dal ko chande ke rup main de saktaa he
 This system does not open the identity of donors and is also exempt from tax
 aam chunaav main kam se kam 1 fisadi vot hasil karne vaale raajnneetik dal ko hi is bond se chanda hasil ho saktaa he
 Also read: Electoral bonds have increased opacity in electoral funding, foreign funds are also possible The central government started this bond with the claim that it will increase transparency in political funding and will bring clean money
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne janvari 2018 main likhaa tha, 'elactoral bond kii yojana raajnneetik funding kii vyavastha main 'saaf-suthra' dhan laane or 'paardarshita' badhaane ke liye laai gai he
 'how these bonds work' An individual, group of people or a corporate bond issuer can buy electoral bonds from the designated branches of SBI within 10 days of the month of issuance
 jari hone kii tithi se 15 dinon kii vaidhata vaale bond 1000 rupye, 1 xxrep 4 0 rupye, ek lakh rupye, 10 lakh rupye or 1 karod rupye ke gunakon main jari kiye jate hai
 These bonds cannot be purchased in cash and the buyer has to submit a KYC (know Your Customer) form to the bank
 siyaasi dal esbiai main apane khaaton ke jariye bond ko bhunaa sakate hai
 That is, the party to whom the customer gives this bond as donation can redeem it by depositing it in his SBI account
 party ko nakad bhugtan kisi bhi dasha main nahin kiya jaataa or paisa uske nirdhaarit khate main hi jaataa he
 The KYC norm is followed by electoral bonds that provide the basis of accounts of individuals who donate money to political parties and the details of accounts
 elactoral bond main yogadan 'kisi bank ke acount pei check yaa bank khate se electronic clearing system' ke dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 In January 2018, while issuing electoral bond notifications, the government had also made it clear that the purchaser would have to fully meet the Know Your Customers (KYC) norm and pay through a bank account
 sabase zyada phayda bijepi ko!aalochakon kaa kahana he ki ye bond bijepi ko sabase zyada phayda pahunchane vaale sabit hue hai
 The Electoral Bond system was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)
 ediaar kii taraf se pesh vakil prashanth bhushan kaa bhi yahi tark tha ki elactoral bond se corporate or udyog jagat ko phayda ho rahaa he or aise bond se mili chande kaa 95 fisadi hissaa bijepi ko miltaa he
 The Election Commission had also accepted that the highest contribution of Rs 210 crore was received by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2017-18 from electoral bonds
 baaki saare dal milakar bhi is bond se sirf 11 karod rupee kaa chanda hasil kar paae the
 The Election Commission informed the Supreme Court in the ongoing hearing in the matter
 nahin kaayam ho pai paardarshitachunavi funding vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye sarkaar ne elactoral bond kii shuruyaat kii he
 The government started this bond with the claim that it would increase transparency in political funding and bring in clean money, curbing black money
 haalanki, is bond ne paardarshita laane kii jagah jokhim or badha diya he, yahi nahin videshi sroton se bhi chanda aane kii gunjaaish ho gai he
 The Election Commission has also raised doubts in its comments about political funding through unknown banking system like electoral bonds
 supreme court ne is saal 12 march ko hui sunwaayee main centre sarkaar ko naseehat bhi di thi ki is bare main centre sarkaar gambhirtha se kadam uthaae
 Since then, Electoral Bond has been under constant questioning
 raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale chande kaa sorce pataa na hone ke chalate korporate chande ko badhaava mila
 Also, money received from abroad also became legal
 is bond ke strot kaa khulaasa karnaa jaruri nahin he
 Funding from abroad is also possible! While justifying the introduction of electoral bonds, the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote in January 2018, 'electoral bonds plan to bring' clean 'money into the system of political funding and increase' transparency ' Has been brought for ' elactoral bond finance act 2017 main badlaav ke dwaara laae gaye the
 In fact, they increase the risk on transparency
 khud chunaav ayog ne in badlaavon par gahari aapatti karte hue kanoon mantralay ko inamen badlaav ke liye letters likhaa he
 The government says that contributions to electoral bonds are made by 'payee check of a bank or electronic clearing system from a bank account'
 sarkaar kaa yah bhi tark he ki in bond ko ek random serial number die gaye hai jo saamaanya taur par ankhon se nahin dikhte
 Bond issuing SBI does not reveal this serial number to anyone
 chunaav ayog ke jaanch daayre se bahrlekin ukt saare praavdhaanon se bhi samasyaayein dur nahin hotin
 The secrecy and political funding of the donor remains opaque and all this is also outside the purview of the Election Commission
 kevaisi hone ke baad bhi chanda dene vaale ke bare main sirf bank yaa sarkaar ko jaankaree ho sakati he, chunaav ayog yaa kisi aam naagarik ko nahin
 Changing section 29C of the Representation of the People Act (RP Act) states that funds received by electoral bonds will be kept out of the scrutiny of the Election Commission
 chunaav ayog ne ise pratigaami kadam bataaya he
 The Election Commission said that it would also not be able to know whether any political party is taking donations from government companies from foreign sources, which has been banned under Section 29B
 ab tak 6,128 karod rupee ke elactoral bond beche gaepichley saal se ab tak desh ke 16 rajyon main bhartiya state bank (SBI) dwaara 12 charnon main kul 6,128 karod rupee ke elactoral (chunavi) bond beche gaye hai
 Of this, the highest amount of 1879 crore bonds have been sold in Mumbai
 dilli main sabase zyada 4,917 karod rupee ke elactoral bond inkesh hue yani bhunaae gaye hai
 This information has been received in response to the RTI application filed by retired Commodore Lokesh Batra
 ab kya he raajnneetik vivadelactoral bond ko lekar ek baar phir raajnneetik vivaad shuru ho gaya he
 It has been revealed from the RTI that the Reserve Bank had warned the government about the issuance of electoral bonds
 rigerv bank ne kaha tha ki is tarah ke saadhan jari karne vaale athurity ko prabhaav main liya ja saktaa he
 Because of this, transparency cannot be maintained completely
 yah mani londring act ko kamjor karegaa
 Taking an attack on this, the Congress has demanded that the BJP should make public the information about how much donations it has received from the electoral bonds

 On Tuesday, BCCI has appointed Bharat Arun as the bowling coach of Team India
 bharat arun ab srilanka daure se bhartiya team ke gendbaaji coach kii kaman sanbhaalenge
 It is clear that Rahul Dravid has cut the leaf of Zaheer Khan
 bisisiai ke is faisle se antarrashtriya cricket main 610 wicket lene vaale khilaadi par mahaj 6 antarrashtriya wicket lene vaala khilaadi baari pad gaya
 As a bowler, Zaheer Khan has more experience than Bharat Arun
 jahir khan banaam bharat arunjahir khan ne 200 vanade match khele hai or 282 wicket liye hai
 While Arun has played only four odis and managed to take one wicket
 bharat arun ne bharat ke liye 2 test maichon main 4 wicket or 4 vanade maichon main sirf 1 wicket hasil kiye hai
 At the same time, looking at the record of Zaheer Khan, he has taken a total of 610 wickets in odis, Tests and T20s
 jahir ne vanade main 282, test main 311 or tii-20 main 17 wicket hasil kiye he, jabaki arun ke khate main vanade or test milakar sirf paanch wicket hi hai
 Now this record clearly states that according to the record, Zaheer Khan is far ahead of Arun
 lekin phir bhi bisisiai ne ek aise shaks ko team india kaa gendbaaji coach chunaa jiske mahaj 5 antarrashtriya wicket hai
 Now it will be interesting to see how much edge India has in bowling after Bharat Arun took over as bowling coach
 koun hai bharat arun ?1979 bhartiya under-19 cricket team ke jab ravi shastri captain the
 Bharat Arun was then playing as a bowler in the same team
 arun isse pehle 2014 main team india ke gendbaaji coach rah chuke hai, or vah bhi tab jab us vakt ravi shastri team diarector the

 Samajwadi Party national president Mulayam Singh Yadav (netaji) has called on workers to make him prime minister in the next Lok Sabha elections, but his younger brother and state Public Works Minister Shivpal Singh Yadav believe that after a landslide victory in the assembly elections Netaji should have assumed the chief minister's chair
 india today ke pramukh samvaadadaata ashish mishra se baatcheet ke dauraan shivpal ne prashnon ke jawaab bina kisi laag-lapet ke die
 Excerpts of the conversation: After the results of the Assembly elections, there were reports that you were against Akhilesh becoming the Chief Minister
 akhilesh mere bete kii tarah he
 He has lived in my home since childhood and even today he spends most of his time with me
 ek pita kii tarah meri bhi khwaahish he ki vah khub unnati kare
 No one opposed the decision to make Akhilesh the chief minister
 baari bahumat milane ke baad maine netaji ko raay di ki ve mukhyamantri bane
 Netaji is the head of the family and the party
 ve jo nirnay lete hai, ham uskaa maan rakhte hai
 How do you rate Akhilesh's tenure as chief minister so far? Akhilesh has made a brilliant debut
 nihsandeh ve safal mukhyamantri ke rup main ubharenge
 They are very educated
 garibon, chaatro or naujavaanon kii jaruraton ko bhaleebhanti samajhte hai
 The special thing is that after becoming the Chief Minister, he has become more humble and accessible
 mulaayam singh yadav kaa aglaa lakshya loksabhaa chunaav he
 Will you also join him in the politics of the Center? i am an ally of Netaji
 unka jo bhi aadesh hoga, mujhe maanya hoga, lekin meraa centre kii raajnneeti karne kaa iraadaa nahin he
 This time in the assembly elections, your son took command of campaigning in your area
 kya ise raajnneeti main aane se pehle kii training samaj jaae?meraa betaa aditya yadav bachaler of bijness administration (bibie) ke antim varsh kaa chaatr he
 This time i entrusted him with the responsibility of Jaswantnagar block coming to my constituency
 lekin iskaa arth yah nahin ki vah raajnneeti main aayega
 Many of the family members are in politics
 aditya ko raajnneeti main laane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 The speed at which you started investigating corruption in Mayawati's regime is now looking somewhat slow
 duusari partiyaan aarope laga rahi hai ki sapa sarkaar ne mayawati ke prati naram rukh akhriyaar kar liya he?mayawati ke shasankaal main bhrashtachar kaa aisa khulaa khel hua ki badi sankhya main naukarshahi beyimaan ho gai
 Due to lack of cooperation from him, rapid investigation could not be done
 thodaa samay lag saktaa he, lekin bhrashtachar main lipt logon par kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 If most of the bureaucracy has become corrupt, then from where will you get better officers to run your government? kai achche adhikari or karmchaaree bhi hai
 They are being encouraged to do better
 aarope he ki sapa main ek nahin, 3-4 mukhyamantri hai, jo swatantra kaam karte hai
 Opponents also point towards you? The whole cabinet is running the government under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav
 sabhi sadsy bagaiyr mukhyamantri ko jaankaree die koi nirnay nahin lete

 According to this strategy, Hooda will go to every panchayat and talk to the farmers to get their rights

 These farmers demand that according to the decision of the Supreme Court, their comments - satluj-yamuna link se inke hisse kaa pani mili - Diesel rate should be reduced in proportion to the crude oil fall rate - sabziyon kaa bhi samarthan mulya tay kiya jaae - Support price of sugarcane should be increased and it should be Rs 400 quintal

 co / psewwyakri a post shared by Bollywoodnewzz (@bollywoodnewzz) on Jul 26, 2018 at 1:44pm PDT Following the decision to repeal two sections of Article 370, the government plans to hold a major investment conference in Jammu and Kashmir in October, in which the country's leading business people will participate
 is sammelan kaa aayojan dashahara ke aasapaas kiya jayega, kyonki sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki anuchhed 370 samaapt hone se ilaake main nivesh ke liye anukool maahaul banegaa
 News agency IANS has quoted this news as quoted by sources
 sarkaar ne kaha ki pradesh ke vikaas ke maarg main yah anuchhed sabase bada baadhak tha, kyonki iske kaaran kashmir ke baahar ke log pradesh main jameen-jaaydaad main nivesh nahin kar pate the
 Due to this, industrialists could not set up their own factory
 sarkaar ne kaha ki yah anuchhed rajya main nijee yaa vaishvik nivesh ke maarg main baadhak tha
 Officials hope that when the situation improves and peace is restored, then people will understand that it was in their interest to abolish special status
 gauratlab he ki somvaar ko grahamantri amit shah ne sadan main anuchhed 370 hataane kaa sankalp sadan main pesh kiya
 He said that only Section 1 will remain in Article 370 applicable in Kashmir, the remaining provisions will be removed
 iske alaava nae praavdhaan main jammu kashmir punargathan kaa prastaav bhi shaamil he
 Under it, Jammu and Kashmir will now be a union territory and Ladakh has been separated from Jammu and Kashmir
 use bhi centre shasit pradesh kaa darja diya gaya he
 However, there will be no assembly there
 is faisle ke saath hi jammu-kashmir main property ke rate main kareeb 50 fisadi ke oochaal kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, after this decision of the Modi government, if any citizen living in India can buy a house, plot, farm land, shop, etc
 in Jammu and Kashmir
 pehle keval rajya kaa nivasee hi sampatti ko kharid saktaa tha or bharatiyon ko sampatti kharidne par roak thi
 With this, a tremendous boom in the real estate sector of Jammu and Kashmir is expected

 After the decision, Mulayam had said that the Muslims of the country felt cheated by this decision
 amar ne mulaayam singh par tippanee karte hue apane blog par likhaa, ‘achraj to tab hota he, jab ayodhya main todphod machaane vaale sargana sakshi maharaj ko rajyasabha main, vihip ke vishnu hari daalamia ke farjand sanjay daalamia ko rajyasabha main, kalyaan singh ke sahabjade rajvir singh ko apane mantrimandal main or swayan kalyaan singh ko sapa adhiveshan main shirkat karaane vaale ‘moulana mulaayam’ muslim voton ke liye tauhine adaalat karte najar aate hai
