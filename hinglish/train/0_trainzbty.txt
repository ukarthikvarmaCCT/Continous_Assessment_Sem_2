 Opener Gautam Gambhir, who is out of the Indian team, does not believe that spot fixing and betting has tarnished the IPL image
 unhone kaha ki kuch galat logon ke kaaran puure khel kii chhavi nahin bigadati
 Captain Gambhir of Kolkata Knight Riders also said, "some people who have done something wrong do not portray the image of the whole game
" ab bhi karodon log aise hai, jo maidan par utarkar desh kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa chaahate hai
 IPL is an important tournament for Gambhir, but he feels that banning cheerleaders is not the solution to eradicate corruption from the competition
 unhone ‘enditivi’ se kaha, mere hisaab se yah vyakti par nirbhar karata he
 You cannot stop a person from doing wrong things
 ipel mahatvapurn toornament he
 When i joined KKR, i only focused on doing well on the field
 gambhir ne kaha, lekin yadi kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki ipel maidan kii baahar kii gatividhiyon ke liye adhik he to ve ipel ko galat tareeke se le rahe hai
 Some people think like this and you cannot control them
 sabase badhiya tarika yahi he ki unhen ipel kaa hissaa nahin banaaya jaae
 Gambhir is out of the Indian team recently due to poor performance
 england main chal rahi champions trophy ke liye bhi unke naam par vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 The comments gambhir se poocha gaya ki champions trophy main shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma kii salaami jodi acha pradarshan kar rahi he, aise main unke liye vaapasi karnaa kitna mushkil hoga, unhone kaha, kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye yah myne nahin rakhata ki vaapasi kitni mushkil he
 His scoring is important because as a batsman you play cricket and this makes you more happy
 gambhir ne manoj tiwari kii is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya ki 2012 kaa champion kolkata niterides is baar ipel main isliye acha pradarshan nahin kar paaya kyonki team main aapasi sauhaard kii kami thi
 He said, i do not know what Manoj Tiwari said
 yah uskaa nijee vichaar he, lekin yadi aap acchhee cricket nahin khelte to aapako aisa sunanaa padataa he
 This will happen when you don't play as a team
 kolkata niterides ke bhi captain gambhir ne kaha, kuchhek log jinhone kuch galat kiya he ve puure khel kii chhavi pesh nahin karte
 Even today, there are crores of people who want to come on the field and represent the country
 gambhir ke liye ipel mahatvapurn toornament he, lekin unhen lagata he ki chiyarliders par pratibandh lagaana pratiyogita se bhrashtachar ko mitaane kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 He told 'NDTV', i think it depends on the person
 aap kisi vyakti ko galat kaam karne se nahin roak sakate
 The IPL is an important tournament
 jab main keker se judaa to maine keval maidan par acha pradarshan karne par dhyaan diya
 Gambhir said, but if some people believe that the IPL is more for off-field activities, then they are taking the IPL the wrong way
 kuch log hi aisa sochate hai or aap un par niyantran nahin kar sakate
 The best way is not to make them part of the IPL
 gambhir haal main lachar pradarshan ke kaaran bhartiya team se baahar chal rahe hai
 His name was also not considered for the ongoing Champions Trophy in England
 tippaniyan Gambhir was asked how the opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are doing well in the Champions Trophy, so how difficult it would be for them to make a comeback, he said, no matter how difficult it is for any player to return
 uskaa ran bananaa mahatvapurn hota he, kyonki ballebaaj hone ke kaaran aap isiilie cricket khelte ho or isse aapako adhik khushi milti he
 Gambhir refused to accept Manoj Tiwari's assertion that 2012 champions Kolkata Knight Riders could not perform well in the IPL this time because the team lacked mutual harmony
 unhone kaha, mujhe nahin pataa ki manoj tiwari ne kya kaha
 This is his personal view, but if you do not play good cricket then you have to listen to it
 jab aap team ke rup main nahin khelte ho to aisa hoga

 Despite this, the BSP has relied for the second time within a month
 rajyasabha kii tarah sapa emelsi ke chunaav main bhi basapa ko samarthan karegi
 Let me tell you that in the Rajya Sabha elections in the past, there was a contest of 10 seats in UP

 At the same time, BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar could not succeed
 26 april ko MLC chunaavuttar pradesh kii 13 vidhaan parishad siton ke liye 26 april ko chunaav hone hai
 With the help of sitting mlas, BJP is set to win 11 and the opposition 2 seats
 is tarah se sapa kii ek or ek seat vipaksh ekajute hokar apane ummidavaar ko jita saktaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav is constantly trying to strengthen the SP-BSP friendship
 rajyasabha chunaav main haar kii bharpai karne ke liye ab sapa ne vidhaan parishad chunaav main basapa ko samarthan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 This is a gift from Akhilesh to Mayawati, so that the future of the alliance of the two parties does not come in any way

 The SP has decided to support the BSP on 1 seat
 sapa ke is elaan ke baad saaf he ki basapa ummidavaar bhale hi rajyasabha chunaav haar gaye hai, lekin vidhaan parishad pahunchnaa tay he
 The tenure of these members is coming to full term from the Legislative Council of Akhilesh Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhary, Naresh Uttam, Umar Ali Khan, Madhu Gupta, Ramsakal Gurjar and Vijay Yadav from Purnaspa
 bispi ke vijay pratap singh or sunil kumaar chittod, ralod ke choudhary mushtak, bijepi se mohsin raja or mahendra kumaar singh kaa bhi kaarykaal puraa ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, elections are to be held on the vacant seat of Ambika Chaudhary who went from SP to BSP

 Many people criticized that Yash Raj gave the responsibility of such a big film in the hands of a director whose previous record was not special
 vijay ne film dhooma or dhooma 2 ke liye safal screenple to likhe the lekin unhone dhooma 3 ko diarect bhi kiya tha
 Dhoom 3 is featured in Aamir's weak films
 iske alaava vijay superflop tashan kaa bhi nirdesan kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, the responsibility of such a big project on a young director was heavy on Yash Raj and he had to face a big failure in the form of Thugs of Hindostan

 a small smile can give you a different identity among people
 aamtaur par ham intervyuu ke dauraan apane pregentation ko lekar bahut asahaj hote hai
 But do you know that the interviewer examines you to a large extent in just 7 seconds
 aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki aapaki persenality kaa pataa vah aapaki body language or muskaraane ke tareeke se lagaataa he
 That is, a smile should also be required during the interview
 kitna or kaise, jaane yahaan :1
 When you meet someone, even before you speak, your smile puts an impression on the front
 isliye apane chehre par hameshaa natural smil rakhen
 It also tells your positive thinking
 2
 Your laughter reflects your confidence
 udhaaharan ke taur par aap jab kisi insaan se milte hai or vak bina kisi smil ke aapako dekhtaa he to aapako apane andar negative feeling aegi
 So always remember that a small smile attaches you to the front
 3
 Mistakes are very common during work, even during this time your smile proves to be very effective
 kyonki galati karne ke baad galati ko ignor karne se acha he, use choti si smil ke saath apane bos ke saamne sweekaaren
 By doing this, the boss also feels that you are not going to run away from mistakes but face him
 4
 Who does not like the atmosphere of laughter and happiness
 aksar offis main aapane dekha hoga jo log bas chupchaap rahete hai yaa phir sakht ravaiya rakhte hai, unase log baat karnaa bhi pasand nahin karte
 At the same time, people who meet you smiling, you do not forget to meet them
 ab aap par he ki aap khadoos bananaa chaahate hai yaa sabake chahete
 5
 sabase jaruri cheez ki doctors bhi aapako muskuraane kii salaah dete hai
 It works like magic during the tension from home to office
 6
 Never forget to maintain your eye contact during interviews
 7
 Along with your smile, keep your balance of interest
 agar aapaki aawaaj intervyuu ke dauraan tej yaa dhimi ho jaati he to yah aapke lakshya se bhatakane ke vyavaahar ko dikhaata he

 The fire of the movement against corruption which was seen to be dull, has erupted again

 Anna Hazare and his team have created an air of agitation
 mangalvaar ko anna dilli pahunche to samarthakon kaa huzoom usee puraane hausale ke saath sadakon par niklaa
 Anna Hazare will reach Rajghat with his supporters at about quarter to eleven in the day
 baapu ko naman karne ke baad kaafila jantar mantar ke liye kooch karegaa
 Team Anna members Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai will sit on an indefinite hunger strike at Jantar Mantar
 arvind kejariwal pehle hi saafe kar chuke hai ki maang puri hone nahin hone tak ve jantar mantar se nahin uthenge, chaahe anshan par baithe-baithe unki jaan chali jaae
 Anna Hazare has given a 4-day ultimatum

 This time Team Anna has entered the movement with more preparations
 bas dekhnaa ye he ki kya aam janata kaa vaisaa samarthan miltaa he, jaisaa ab tak miltaa aayaa he
 What are the demands of Team Anna? Anna is no longer just asking for a strong Lokpal
 ab uske nishane par un mantriyon kii jamaat he, jin par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 Anna wants an independent investigation against the tainters and a fast track court should be set up to settle the cases
 tabhi majboot lokapal vajood main aa sakegaa
 The real issue is about the Lokpal, but this time the target is on those who are obstructing the path of the strong Lokpal bill
 ye kahana he team anna kaa ki jab tak sansad main bhrasht netaa baithe hai, tab tak bhrashtachar ke kilaaf kathor kaanoon bananaa mushkil he
 Arvind Kejriwal says that there are so many allegations of corruption against 15 ministers that if they pass the Lokpal bill today, then these people will be jailed, their property will be confiscated
 isiilie ye sarkaar lokapal bill nahin laa rahi he
 This time Anna has placed three demands before the government
 pehali maang- jin mantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope hai unki jaanch ke liye special investigeshan team kaa gathan jald kiya jaae
 Second demand - The party presidents against whom the CBI is investigating should be handed over to the Special Investigation Team
 teesri maang majboot lokapal kii he, jiske liye team anna arase se ladaai lard rahi he
 Team Anna is warning that if the immediate steps are not taken against corruption, the peace and tranquility of the country may be in danger
 team anna ke sadsy prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki ye desh agar isi vyavastha se chalata rahaa to aap maanakar chaliye ki ye desh grihayuddh kii taraf bad rahaa he
 Anna and her team have made it clear that this time the conspiracy, the statements and the talks are not going to happen, the movement will stop only when the concrete result is revealed

 modi sarkaar ne haal hi main ghoshnaa kii he ki sarkaar ne desh ke har gaanv ko raushan kar diya he
 But the real challenge for the government is to provide electricity to every house in the village
 ye chunauti kitni badi he iskaa sabase andaaza uttar pradesh main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 3 of the country 31 karod andhere gharon main se 42 fisadi isi rajya se aate hai
 That is, about one crore houses have not got electricity yet
 afsos kii baat ye he ki jo sonbhadra jila thermal power kaa centre he
 There are 8 big power stations and this district gets electricity from different parts of the country
 lekin aapako jaankaree hairaani hogi ki is jile main vidyutikaran bas 27 fisadi hi he
 The deadline to deliver electricity to every household by 31 December 2018 by Prime Minister Modi is a big challenge
 enditivi kii team ne kai gaanvon main jaakar jamini hakeekat jaanane ke kii koshish kii he
 Electricity came to the village of Kachan in Sonbhadra 4 months ago
 isi gaanv ke rahane vaale 35 saal ke mumtaz hossain ne fouran ye freezer karidaa or cold drink kii dukaan khol lee
 Earlier, they did not have a good means of earning a living
 lekin unka kahana he ab unki aay kuch thik he
 Similarly, the first people who came to Nagaraj village of Sonbhadra were destroyed during the construction of Rihand Dam
 rihand menkai bijlighar hai lekin nagaraj ne kabhi bijli nahin dekhi
 The comments lakhanu ke kareeb hardoi jile ke puuranakheda gaanv main pehali baar koi sarkaar bijli laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The population here ranges from 800 to 900 people
 gaanv ke kinare 61 saal ke kadale ke ghar sarkaar ne holi se pehle bilkul nayaa meter muft main lagaaya
 He also promised to provide electricity within a week, but so far no electricity has been delivered
 lekin unki ummid bani hui he
 Within the given time limit of the Prime Minister, the government has to provide electricity to 2 lakh 40,000 homes in Hardoi in 8 months
 yani har rose 1000 gharon main
 At the same time, the Yogi government of UP says that it is ready to take up the challenge of illuminating one crore houses in 8 months
 sarkaar ke mutabik wo har zile main free bijli camp lagaakar nunatam charch vaale power conection de rahi he
 The government claims that the work of district power installation is being monitored everyday
 lekin ek hakeekat yah bhi he ki upi main 1 karod 31 lakh ghar hai jahaan bijli nahin pahunchi he
 Those without electricity in the country3
 13 karod ghar hai, unamem 42 fisadi akele upi ke hai
 The NDTV team has tried to know the ground reality by visiting several villages
 sonbhadra ke hi kachan gaanv main 4 maheene pehle bijli ai he
 Mumtaz Hussain, 35, of the same village, immediately bought this freezer and opened a cold drink shop
 isse pehle unke paas roji-roti kamaane kaa acha saadhan nahin tha
 But they say their income is fine now
 isi tarah sonbhadra ke nagaraj gaanv main sabase pehle jo log aae wo rihand dam banane ke dauraan se ujaade gaye the
 Rihand has many powerhouses but Nagraj never saw electricity
 tippaniyan For the first time a government is trying to bring electricity in Purankheda village of Hardoi district near Lucknow
 yahaan kii aabaadi 800 se 900 logon kii he
 The government of 61-year-old Kadale, on the banks of the village, installed a completely new meter before Holi
 hafte bhar ke bheetar bijli dene kaa vaada bhi kiya lekin ab tak bijli nahin pahunchi he
 But his hopes remain
 pradhanmantri kii di gai samay seemaa ke andar sarkaar ko hardoi main 8 maheene main 2 lakh 40,000 gharon main bijli pahunchaani he
 That means in 1000 houses every day
 vahiin upi kii yogi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki wo 8 maheene main ek karod gharon ko roshan karne kii chunauti uthaane ko taiyaar he
 According to the government, it is providing free electricity connections in every district by setting up free electricity camps
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki zilaavaar bijli lagane ke kaam kii har rose nigaraanee ho rahi he
 But there is also a reality that there are 1 crore 31 lakh houses in UP where there is no electricity
 desh main bina bijli vaale jo 3
 There are 13 crore houses, 42 percent of them are from UP alone
 lakhanu ke kareeb hardoi jile ke puuranakheda gaanv main pehali baar koi sarkaar bijli laane kii koshish kar rahi he

 Parrikar was suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer, which was diagnosed in February last year

 jab mujhe bijepi ne goa kii jimmedaari saunpi tab maine manohar parrikar, shripad nike, sanjeev desai or digambar kaamat in chaaron logon kii team main unke saath kaam kiya
 i have seen the beginning of his life politics
 manohar parrikar ko shradhanjali dene ke liye yahaan clic karen
 
 
 Even after being an IIT engineer, his behavior was very simple
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad apane kapade pahanane kaa dhang nahin badla
 Your nature has not changed
 or raksha mantri banane ke baad bhi wo vaise hi rahe
 When Manohar came to Delhi, i asked him to change his clothes
 
 
 yahaan bahut thand hoti he, half shart main dilli nahin chalati
 So they said i will remain like this
 kendriya mantri gadakari ne parrikar ke saath bitaye samay ko bhi yaad kiya

 In that program, he came in a chair and gave a speech for two minutes
 udghaatan hua or wo chale gaye
 Then i was saying in my mind that this will probably be Manohar's last show
 or wo hamen chhodkar chale gaye
 Gadkari said that his death has greatly damaged my personal life as a friend
 unhone apana puraa jivan goa ko samarpit kar diya
 i am surprised to see their stubbornness and will power
 bahut dukh or dard hua

 In many parts of India, people eat banana leaves
 kele ke pattey par khaanaa unki sthaneey parampara kaa hissaa he
 While guests are served food at the top of the banana leaf, the people of the house themselves eat it by keeping food at the bottom
 saaf farsh par baithkar sabhi bina kaante-chammach ke haath se khaanaa khate hai
 Rice, meat, vegetables, curries, pickles, yogurt are all served on this banana leaf
 haalanki jin logon ko kele ke pattey par khaanaa parosane or khaane kii aadat nahin he unhen ye kaaphi mushkil lag saktaa he lekinhjaron saal se chali aa rahi is parampara kii apni manyataayen hai
 The advantages of this tradition are truly shocking: 1
 swasthya ke lihaaj secole kaa patta plant-besd compound, polifeynolls se purna hota he
 Polyphenols are natural antioxidants that act to provide protection against free radicals and other diseases present in the body
 ek ore jahaan kele kii pattiyon ko sidhe taur par pachaana sambhav nahin he vahiin kele ke pattey main rakhe khaadya padaarth isse polifeynolls ko avashoshit kar lete hai
 By this, the body also gets the benefit of these oxidants
 iske saath hi ye mana jaataa he ki kele ke pattey main anti-bacterial gun paae jate hai joki khaane main maujuud bacteria ko samaapt kar dete hai
 This reduces the possibility of falling ill
 2
 Taste increases Banana leaves have a wax-like upper layer
 haalanki ye parat bahut patali hoti he lekin iskaa swaad bahut alag hota he
 When hot food is served on a banana leaf, it melts the wax and gets mixed into the food
 jisase khaane kaa swaad or bad jaataa he
 3
 paryaavaran ke liye achaaaj jabaki paryaavaran kii suraksha ek ahm masalaa ban chukaa he aise main kele kii pattee par khaanaa khaanaa paryaavaran suraksha ke lihaaj se ek sarthak pahal he
 People usually use plastic or stereofoam plates for a feast or a function
 istemaal ke baad inhen yun hi phenk diya jaataa he
 While it is very easy to decompose banana leaves
 4
 The leaves of hygienicale do not require much cleaning
 ye khud hi bahut hyanic hoti hai
 They can be used only after cleaning them with a little water
 plastic kii plate main khaanaa swasthya ke liye hanikaarak hota he
 5
 rasayan mukt or aaraamdehkele kii pattee main khaane kaa sabase bada phayda ye he ki isse hamaare sharir main kisi bhi prakaar kaa koi rasinic padaarth pravesh nahin kar paata he
 While eating in a plastic plate, some part of the molten plastic also goes into our body
 joki cancer jaisi bhayanak beemaari kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 In such a situation, eating food on banana leaves is very beneficial for health
 saath hi ye kaaphi bada bhi hota he jis par sabhi chijen salike se parosi ja sakati hai

 The devastation caused by nature in Uttarakhand has raised many questions
 sabase bada sawaal ye pahaado par jo kuch hua kya uskaa vakt sahi tha? shaayad nahin, june main kudarat ne kabhi aisa kahar nahin dhaaya
 In the month of June, the rain never caused such a waste
 pahaado par jo kuch hua usase puri duniya hairaan rah gai or ek ke baad ek kai sawaal khadey hue
 The question is, why did the weather change in June? Why did the record of rain fall in June? It is not that there is no heavy rain in the mountains
 aisa bhi nahin he ki pahaado par baadh nahin aati
 The question is not about the ugly face of nature, but the question of the time of the ugly form of nature
 kareeb kareeb har saal pahaado par baari barish hoti he lekin is baar june main hi kudarat ne tandav machaa diya
 It rained so much that Alaknanda started hitting hard on seeing this
 mandakini vikaraal ho gai or bhagirathi khoonkhaar
 In such a situation, questions arose - why flood in the mountains in June? Why did the nature wreak havoc in June? The locals, the tourists and the pilgrims who visited the Char Dham would hardly have imagined that this time the weather would change before the time and nature would wreak havoc
 jis barish or baadh kii aahat 15 dinon baad sunai dene vaali thi usne vakt se pehle hi hajaaron jindagiyon ko apni chapet main le liya or kahar dhaati rahi
 Not only on the hills, but also in the plains, this time the rain is breaking the record of years
 bhopal main is saal pichley 75 saalon ke record tut gaye
 For the first time since 1938, Bhopal saw such rain
 desh ke duusare hisson main bhi barish ne record tod diya he
 It is raining more than expected and premature rains
 lekin sawaal ye ki kyon? kyon mausam kaa mizaaj badal rahaa he? kahin ye aane vaale kisi bade khatre kaa sanket to nahin?sirf pahaado par nahin maidani hisson main bhi monsoon matvaala ho gaya he
 Above average and premature rains are raining
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 150 saalon main aisa pehali baar hua he
 You will be surprised to know that 77 percent of the country has received excess rainfall
 chaahe dehradun yaa phir dilli, bhopal ho yaa phir amritsar, srinagar ho yaa phir mumbai
 In June this year, the record of rain was broken in every corner of the country
 uttarakhand ke pahaado par pichley das saalon main june ke maheene main itani barish kabhi nahin hui
 According to statistics 359 in 2004 in Uttarakhand
 3 mimi barish hui thi
 593 here in 2008
 8 mimi barish record kii gai
 386 in 2011 in Uttarakhand
 5 mimi barish hui or is saal ab tak 401
 8 mm of rain has been recorded
 jabaki barish ke abhi do maheene baaki hai
 Usually rains occur in July and August, but weather experts claim that 77 percent more rainfall has been received across the country so far this year, a record for the last 150 years
 desh ke duusare hisson main bhi barish ke aankadon par najar daali jaae to pataa chalata he ki uttar-pashchim bharat main 120 fisadi barish zyada hui he
 All regions of central India have recorded more than 90 percent rainfall
 dakshin bharat kii baat karen to yahaan par bhi monsoon ke kaale badal 46 fisadi zyada barase hai
 Only in Northeast India, this time in the month of June, the monsoon rains have been 45% below normal
 is baar monsoon uttar-pashchim bharat main samay se pehle pahunch gaya
 Due to this, there was excess rain in all areas
 yani monsoon ne is baar saare purvanumaan bigaad ke rakh die hai
 According to meteorologists, the monsoon conditions are expected to be good in July and August and it will not be wrong to say that this time the monsoon may be more than normal

 duniya parfect lagane lagati he
 Things change in life but true love grows deeper
 aise main har ladki kii yah khwaahish hoti he ki uskaa boyfriend hi aage chalakar uskaa pati bane
 If you too are seeing your boyfriend as a future husband, then first you need to know if he will prove to be a good husband
 to in baton par use parakhen:1) ek duusare kii pasand kii samjaap donon ke bich main bhale hi kai baton ko lekar manmutav ho
 You have different views for things, but on most things, you get your own side of it
 yani aksar aisa hota he ki aap donon ek hi baat par sahamat ho jate hai
 Of course this is a quality of a good relationship
 2) ladaai khatm karne kii pahalkabhi-kabhi rishte main ladaai itani bad jaati he ki lagata he ki bas ab nahin ho paaegaa
 Seeing this, your relationship comes to the brink of breakup
 aise main agar aapkaa boyfriend aapke paas baithkar chizon ko sire se solve karne kii puri koshish karata he to vah ek behatar pati sabit hoga
 3) Good behavior to all If your boyfriend behaves well with your family, friends and everyone besides you, then this is also a signal
 kyonki jis tarah se vah gairon ke saath pesh aata he, usase pataa chalata he ki vah kis tarah kaa insaan he
 4) Your support is sometimes you take some decisions on which your family and your friends do not agree
 yahaan tak ki aapkaa saath bhi chhod dete hai
 If your boyfriend still supports you at that time then it is a positive signal
 isse yah pataa lagata he ki vah bhavishya main bhi aapkaa saath degaa
 5) Listens to you carefully if your boyfriend really listens to you
 aapaki sabhi pareshaani sunne ke baad aapako jaj karata he to aapako samaj lenaa chahie ki vahabhavishya main bhi aapaki kisi bhi pareshaaniko ignor nahin karegaa
 This shows how much he cares about your happiness
 6) har mushkil main vah kaam aata hazindagi main kai aise mode aate hai jab aap andar se tut jate hai
 You feel that this world is not capable of trust
 or us samay jab aapke saamne sirf ek cheharaa aae jis par aap aasaani se bharosa kar paaen
 If so, then understand that your boyfriend is a right choice
 7) samay ke saath pyaar badha hedgar aapke relationships ko ek lanbaa samay ho chukaa he
 Nearly 5-6 years have passed
 baavjood iske aapako uske pyaar main koi kami nahin lagati
 Even sometimes you feel that this angel is going deeper and deeper with time, then understand that you have chosen the right partner

 Cricket experts are not considering Pakistan as a strong contender for the ICC World Cup 2015, starting on 14 February in Australia and New Zealand, but the history created by the Pakistan team in the same region 23 years ago cannot be forgotten
 yah bhi sahi he ki 23 saalon main cricket kaaphi badla he or yah jaruri nahin ki pakistani team us itihaas ko dohraane main kaamyaab ho hi jaae
 There is no such star or big player in the Pakistan team at the moment, as well as some players are out of the tournament, the team's problems have increased
 harfanmaulaa khilaadi mohammad hafeez or baayen haath ke tej gendbaaj junayd khan kaa vishwacap se thik pehle team se baahar hona pakistan ke liye bada jhatka he
 Saeed Ajmal has recently been allowed to bowl by the International Cricket Council (ICC), but whether he will be included in the Pakistan team or not is yet to be answered
 pakistan team ko kuch dinon pehle hi newjiland se donon ekadivasiy main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 This defeat also raises questions on the team's preparedness
 aise main 40 varshiya misbah ul haq ke netritv main pakistani team itihaas rach paaegi yaa nahin, is par andeh he
 Pakistan, however, surprised the entire world by winning the World Cup trophy under the leadership of Imran Khan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) 23 years ago
 misbah ne imran khan kii tarah vishwacap se kaaphi pehle hi toornament ke baad ekadivasiy cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 Bowling has always been a strong side of Pakistan
 is baar isaki jimmedaari mohammad irfan, wahaab riyaj jaise baayen haath ke gendbaajon par hogi
 All eyes will be on Pakistan's experienced player Shahid Afridi
 unki visphotak ballebaaji or spin gendbaaji main team ko toornament main dur tak le jane kii kshamta he
 In the World Cup, Pakistan is in Group b with teams like South Africa, West Indies, Zimbabwe, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and defending champions India
 pakistan or bharat ko toornament kaa apana pehla match ek-duusare ke khilaaf edilade ovel main 15 farvari ko khelnaa he
 Pakistan last met India in the 2011 World Cup semi-finals, where they lost
 vaise, bharat hameshaa hi vishwacap main pakistan ko parrast karata aayaa he
 However, Pakistan has fond memories of the 1992 World Cup, when the World Cup tournament was played for the first time with artificial light and colored jerseys

 bade star beshak unke saath kaam karne se jhijaken yaa duuri banaakar rakhane kii koshish karen lekin chote sitare or diarector unhen haathon haath le rahe hai
 There is something similar in 'paheli Leela'
 puri film main sani hisanihai
 And it is Sunny's art that makes her stand out on the big giants in terms of popularity in India: glamorous and sexy style
 punarjanm kii is kahani main sani ke kai rang dekhne ko milte hai
 But the story is weak, Sunny should start focusing on acting and little story now
 kahani main kitna damasani leone (mira) landan kii supermodel he or apane jivan kii kuch pareshaaniyon kii vajah se pareshaan rahati he
 He has to come to India from his project once
 vah rajasthan aati he or use kuch chizon kaa ehsaas hone lagata he
 Interestingly, three centuries ago, Meera Leela used to be a Rajasthan girl
 ek murtikar uskaa divaana he
 Leela is in love with another boy
 vartmaan main bhi use pyaar hota he lekin itihaas peechha nahin chodta or phir ateet or vartmaan kii jang shuru ho jaati he
 The story seems old
 nae pen kaa abhaav he
 The director seems to have thrown his full strength to show Sunny in a glamorous style
 film khinchi hui lagati he or gane bemail
 If the star appealson Leon is on screen, then the eyes of the viewers are reduced to other things
 yah puri film sani factor par he, lekin sani ko aage kaa safar tay karne ke liye apane acting skills ko thodaa or manjana hoga kyonki darshakon ko baandhe rakhane kii kuwvat unamem he, bas jarurat he to thodaa tallent ko nikhaarane kii
 He should start taking his film career serially
 rahul dev kii acting acchhee he
 Mohit Ahlawat has also made a decent comeback
 jai bhanushaali or rajnish duggal bhi oke hai
 But a linen is heavy on everything
 kamai kii batfilm ko bhavy banane kii koshish kii gai he
 There are many types of singing
 lekin kuch bhi us tarah asar nahin daal paata jaisaa diarector ne koshish kii he
 Direction is weak
 kahani dhili he
 everything is normal
 sani ke phans unhengau kii chhorike andaaj main jarur pasand karenge
 He has played both the characters in a very different way
 film main unhone kaha he ki glamer industry main saxes kaa shortkat short skirt he, lekin vah is short cat ko kaaphi pehle apana chuki hai, ab thodaa aage badhen
 The budget of the film is 15 crores
 he, dekhen box offis par sani kitna chamatkaar kar paati hai

 With the help of opener Lokesh Rahul's third century of his career, India strengthened their position by scoring 185 for one wicket by lunch on the second day of the second cricket test against West Indies
 lunch ke samay rahul 107, jabaki cheteshwar pujaara 37 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 Both have so far shared 98 runs for the second wicket
 rahul kii 199 gend kii pari main 12 chauke or ek chakka shaamil he, jabaki pujaara ne ab tak 131 gend kaa saamana karte hue teen chauke jade hai
 The hosts were once again disappointed by the bowlers who could not get a single wicket in 26 overs in the morning session
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne bhi haalanki dhimi ballebaaji karte hue 59 ran hi jutaaye
 The West Indies team was able to score 196 runs in the first innings and thus Virat Kohli's team is trailing by just 11 runs in the first innings with nine wickets remaining

 Pujara was lucky in the third over of the day when Gabriel's ball took the edge of his bat, but did not reach Marlon Samuels standing in the second slip
 gabriyal ne rahul ko bhi pareshaan kiya, lekin mejabaan team ko safalataa nahin dilaa paae
 The Indian team could muster only 22 runs in 13 overs in the first hour, but during this time the visiting team did not lose a single wicket
 westeindies ke captain jesan holder ne pari ke 48wein over main of spinner roston chej ko jab din main pehali baar gendbaaji ke liye bulaayaa to rahul ne deep squaire leg par balle se din kaa pehla chaukaa jadaa
 In the 50th over of Chase's innings, Pujara scored his opening run of the second day's play on 35th ball with two runs
 rahul ne chej kii gend par do ran ke saath 52wein over main bharat kaa score 150 ran ke paar pahunchaaya

 pujaara din ke tisare over main hi bhaagyashaalee rahe, jab gabriyal kii gend ne unke balle kaa kinaaraa liya, lekin duusari slip main khadey marlon sampuls ke paas tak nahin pahunchi
 Gabriel also troubled Rahul, but could not bring success to the hosts

 com / 9z6ylbti7m Maharashtra BJP President Chandrakant Patil press conference and target Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha ki vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne shivasena va anya dalon ke saath milakar mahayuti banaai thi
 The people gave the responsibility of running the government by giving mandate to Mahayuti but Shiv Sena has disrespected the mandate
 lihaaja ham rajyapal ko jaankaree dene ke liye aae hai ki ham sarkaar nahin banaaenge
 He said that the governor had sent us an invitation to form the government but due to lack of majority, we will not form the government
 aapaki jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko 105 siton par jeet mili thi vahiin shivasena 56 siten jitkar duusare number kii party bani thi
 In Maharashtra, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance had got a clear majority but due to some reasons the differences between the two parties came to light, due to which the matter of formation of the state government was stuck in the balance
 rajyapal kii taraf se sabase bade dal ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya gaya tha, jiske jawaab main bijepi ne sarkaar banane par apni asamarthta jataa di he
 Therefore, the Governor will invite the second largest party to form the government
 supreme court ne yah vyavastha di he ki dahej hatya ke maamle main kisi vyakti par mukadmaa chalaane ke liye use us samay tak rishtedaar nahin mana ja saktaa jab tak pati se uskaa khun, vivaah yaa god liye jane kaa rishta na ho
 The apex court also made it clear that this does not mean that such a person cannot be prosecuted on charges like abetment to suicide
 nyaayamurti chandramauli kumaar prasad or nyaayamurti pi si ghosh kii khandpeeth ne kaha ki unhen isamen koi shaq nahin he ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 304 (bi) (dahej hatya) main 'pati ke rishtedaar' shabd kaa aashay un vyaktiyon se he jinka khun, vivaah yaa god liye jane ke rishte se sambandhit he
 The court made this arrangement on the appeal of the Punjab government against the decision of the punjab-haryana High Court in the dowry murder case
 rajya sarkaar ne is maamle main ek vyakti ko aaropee ke rup main samman jari karne kaa faisla nirast karne ke hai court ke aadesh ko chunauti di thi
 The lower court had summoned a person as an accused in the case
 adaalat kaa kahana tha ki vah mritak mahila ke pati kaa rishtedaar he or is aparaadh main shaamil he

 a company official wrote in a post that we have started '2G Tuesday' for a day under which Facebook employees will use 2G internet
 isse unhen ye samajhane main aasaani hogi ki kaise slo internet main fasebuk yuj karnaa mushkil hota he
 Click here to watch this townhall Q&A session live bhartiya janata party ne apane piem candidet narendra modi ke chunaav prachaar kii akramakata ko kam kar diya he
 In this episode, the party silently advertised their 'I will not let the country bow down
 
 
 main desh nahin mitane duungaa’ ko band kar diya he
 According to an English newspaper, the advertisement campaign, which started about a month ago, has now been discontinued
 ise anaavashyak rup se aakraamak mana ja rahaa tha
 Modi himself speaks these lines passionately in these advertisements
 bijepi ke sutron kaa kahana he ki inase yah abhas miltaa he ki desh kaa astitv hi khatre main he, jo galat he
 Calling these lines from Modi's mouth was also a wrong idea because it gives a very strong tone
 party ke sutron ne patr ko bataaya ki narendra modi kii team bhi is vigyaapan ke geet kii bhaavana or andaaj se puri tarah aashwast nahin thi
 But he followed the decision of the Chief Campaign Committee
 april ke madhya main bijepi ke upar ke halkon main yah baat sabhi ne maan lee ki modi kii chhavi ko naram banaaya jaae
 It is said that Narendra Modi himself took the initiative and kept himself away from the policy of distribution in his campaign in North Bihar
 halaki bijepi ke kuch netaa kishanganj se khadey jedy (you) ummidavaar akhtarul imaan ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh kii maang kar rahe the
 He said that the Muslims in Kishanganj have rallied against the BJP
 iskaa mukaabal isi dhang se hona chahie
 But Modi did not agree to it
 samajha jaataa he ki modi ke abhiyaan kaa ab ‘modi aa gaya’ mantra par zyada jor hoga
 There will be talk of minimum government, maximum governance
 endie ko 300 siten dilaane kaa aagrah vaale modi ke nae abhiyaan main koshish yahi he ki floating voton ko apni ore khinchaa jaae
 Apart from this, Modi and BJP supporters should be encouraged to get out of their homes and vote
 bijepi apane raajnneetik abhiyaanon ke alaava beti bachaao, beti padhaao or rojgaar se jude aarthik vikaas ke naare par jor de rahi he
 It was also felt in the party that the party has succeeded in counting the shortcomings of the ruling UPA
 unhen lag rahaa he ki maahaul modi ke paksh main ban gaya he or isliye ab messej thode chamakdaar hon
 The BJP ad campaign song was penned by Prasoon Joshi and sung by Sukhwinder
 ab modi ke vigyapanon ko positive banaaya ja rahaa he
 Through them, Modi will demand a clear majority from the public
 This day

 com / lzcphbwqkz The girl's mother, who was caught with Major Leetul Gogoi at a hotel in Srinagar, has made serious allegations against Major
 ladki kii maa ne kaha he ki gogai kai baar raat main unke ghar main aa dhamke the or unke saath vah samir ahamed bhi tha, jo hotel main bhi dekha gaya tha
 It is worth mentioning that Major Leetul Gogoi had discussed in Budgam last year that a common citizen was tied on the bonnet of an army jeep and roamed in dozens of villages to protect it from stone pelting
 gauratlab he ki major gogoi ko srinagar ke ek hotel main ek ladki ke saath pakadaa gaya tha
 On Wednesday, the police questioned Gogoi, Sameer Ahmed and the girl
 hotel staffunhen cameraa dene se manaa kar rahaa tha, jiske baad major kii staff se bahes hui or police ne major ko hiraasat main liya tha
 He was later handed over to his unit
 police ko pataa chalaa ki hotel main litul gogoi ke naam se ek cameraa pehle se book tha
 The girl's mother, who lives in a village in Budgam, said that she had left the house in the morning saying that she was going to the bank and did not return after that
 hamen to is ghatana kaa pataa tab chalaa, jab police kaa phone gaanv ke sarpanch ke paas aayaa
 He claimed that Gogoi has visited his house many times, that too at night
 unhone kaha, 've aksar raat main hamaare ghar main dhamak aate the
 My condition used to get worse after seeing Gogoi
 samir meri beti se baat karata tha
 There were some doubts, but never thought that my girl would meet him in a hotel
 'unhone kaha, 'ek raat jabaarmi mejarlitul gogoi hamaare ghar main ghus aae or hamaara haalchaal poochne lage, to main behosh ho gai
 He told that his girl's age is 17 years
 lekin police kaa kahana he ki ladki balig he
 She has been released after taking the girl's statement
 bihar kepurv mukhyamantri nitish kumarrashtrapati ke saamne apane 130 samarthak vidhayakon kii parade kara chuke hai
 Earlier, he had met Governor Kesarinath Tripathi and claimed to be the Chief Minister
 unki maang thi ki 48 ghante ke bheetar rajyapal jeethanram maanjhi ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye kahen
 Otherwise, Nitish knocked on the doors of Rashtrapati Bhavan with JDU President Sharad Yadav, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 vaise nitish ko philhal dabl jhatka laga he
 One, the governor did not listen to him, and the other Patna High Court considered it illegal for Nitish to be elected leader of the legislative party
 ab hai court main 17 farvari ko is maamle kii sunwaayee hogi, jabaki 20 farvari ko maanjhi vidhansabha main bahumat sabit karne kii koshish karenge
 Despite all this, Nitish still has some opportunities - First chance: If Manjhi is not able to prove his majority in the Vidhan Sabha, the Governor can also give Nitish a chance
 nitish ke liye sabase badhiya yahi hoga ki raashtrapati ke saamne unhone jin vidhayakon kii parade karai unka samarthan barkaraar rakhen or vidhansabha main bahumat sabit kar den
 Second chance: Some of the JDU mlas who are getting support from Manjhi are from their Dalit community and some are standing together to become ministers
 aise vidhayakon ko agar nitish ye bharosa dilaa den ki mantri pad to unhen nitish kaa saath dene par bhi mil saktaa he to ve unka samarthan kar sakate hai
 This will make their way to prove majority
 teesraa mauka: vidhansabha main bahumat sabit na kar paane kii sthiti main nitish khud ko shahid ke taur par project kar sakate hai
 Nitish can garner sympathy by imposing all the gifts on BJP which can benefit him in the coming elections
 chauthaa mauka:lalu or mulaayam kaa saath milane se nitish ke saath muslim-yadav vot bank ho gaya he
 Nitish himself has a vote bank of his fraternity
 is tarah lalu or mulaayam ke saath mil kar nitish bijepi ko bihar ke siyaasi khel kaa khalanaayak sabit kar sakate hai
 Fifth chance: Nitish's last option is that he should start preparing for the election from now
 iske liye unke paas saat-aath maheene kaa lanbaa vakt he
 During this, they can formulate a strong election strategy along with selecting their candidates by patting them

 Since, elections are to be held in many other states after Gujarat
 chunavi nateezon ke baad anya rajya main bhi bijepi ko jhatka lag saktaa he jo baari padegaa
 According to the newspaper, the decisions that Modi has taken so far have been attacked by economists and the opposition
 lekin modi ke gujarat model kaa sahi akalan gujarat ke log hi kar sakate hai
 Whatever the outcome of Gujarat, its impact will surely be read on the image of Modi and the policy of his working
 akhbaar ne kaha he ki china ko gujarat main bijepi kii parformens par najar rakhni chahie
 It is written in the newspaper that Chinese companies in India should be prepared for the results of Gujarat

 'world class metro ko badnaam karnaa band karen kejarivalopi sharma ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par jabardast hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki world class dilli metro kii chhavi ko karaab karnaa or usko vivaadon main daalana bahut galat kaam he

 The NDA won a historic victory in the Lok Sabha elections with a thumping majority
 chunaav se pehle bhi bhaajapa kii jeet ke anumaan lagaae ja rahe the
 All exit polls had claimed the victory of the NDA and with the announcement of the result, it became clear that the public has once again given the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a chance
 is chunaav main kai aise mudde the jo purna rup se haaavee rahe, duusare shabdon main kahen to in muddon par janata ne piem modi kaa bharpoor saath diya or unki jeet par muhar lagaai
 The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party also kept the same issues and spoke among the public
 chunavi itihaas main yah pehali baar he jab bhartiya janata party ko itani siten mili hon
 So let's know about the issues that dominate the entire election
 
 
 1-rashtravadabhartiya janata party rashtrawaad ke raste par chalane vaali party he
 While opposition parties appear to be adopting a 'soft corner' on this issue, the BJP has been treating it as their agenda
 bijepi ke netaaon kii baat karen to narendra modi is mudde ke prakhar vaktaa maane jate hai kyonki unke bayanon or bhaashanon main is baat par zyada jor hota he ki pehle raashtra or baad main party yaa parivaar
 He kept nationalism supreme in his speeches
 keval modi hi nahin, balki bhartiya janata party ke anya netaa bhi reliyon main rashtrawaad ke mudde par bal diya
 2- The security of national security be it from internal threat or from external challenges, Narendra Modi has been saying that his government has made India safe on both fronts
 is baat ko unhone apane chunavi bhaashanon main bhi shaamil kiya or jahaan-jahaan reliyaan kin, vahaan is par jor diya
 On the issue of internal danger, he claimed to curb Naxalism and extremism
 unke mutabik 'red coridor' ko unhone green coridor main badalane kaa kaam kiya he
 He has been talking of bringing anti-social elements who have taken the path of violence into mainstream politics
 3-aatankwadatankwaad kaa naam aate hi pakistan kaa naam aata he
 According to Narendra Modi, he isolated Pakistan on every front and conveyed to him that both dialogue and terrorism cannot go hand in hand
 haalanki pakistan is apil se prabhavit nahin hua or uske aatanki karname badastoor jari rahe
 As the Prime Minister has been speaking in his speeches that India has taken this issue to many countries of the world, he has expressed to them that Pakistan is not only a threat to the peace of South Asia but the world as a whole is on its violent radar
 4-hindutvahindutv kaa mudda bhi rashtrawaad kii tarah he jiske prati anya partiyaan 'soft approach' apanaati dikhti hai lekin bijepi is par mukhar rahi he
 Then there has been talk of Ram Mandir and Uniform Civil Code
 haalanki narendra modi is mudde par khulkar bolne se bachate rahe hai lekin varanasi main kaashi vishwanath mandir or haal main kedarnath-badrinath main vidhivat puja paath kaa unka sanskaar yah darshata he ki jis mudde ko anya partiyaan chunavi sijan main akhriyaar karti hai, us mudde par bijepi kaaphi aage nikal chuki he
 5-cleanliness Campaign If any issue was raised most in this election, it is cleanliness campaign
 pradhanmantri ne har bhaashanon main iskaa zikr kiya or bataaya ki unki sarkaar kaise baaki sarkaron se alag he
 He told that the effect of dirt and turbidity does not affect us, not only in the neighborhood but also in the world it tarnishes the image
 iske liye unhone khule main shouch se mukt bharat banane kaa vaada kiya
 Toilets were constructed for this and as the Prime Minister in his speeches claim to make this campaign 100 percent successful, it can be said that this issue can play a major role in his victory
 6-ayushmaan bharat yojanabijepi or narendra modi is yojana ko ek nai kranti bataate hai
 They believe that this is the world's largest health security plan
 unke bhaashanon main yah suna jaataa he ki garibon ke liye yah aisi adbhut yojana he jisase desh ke karodon parivaar labhanvit ho rahe hai or bhavishya main honge
 The Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) under Ayushman Bharat was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ayushmaan bharat duniya kii pehali aisi yojana he, jiske antargat 50 karod se adhik logon ko paanch lakh rupye tak kaa beemaa milegaa
 There is talk of benefiting 40 percent of the lower middle class population
 7-ujjwala yojanayah yojana narendra modi sarkaar kii kai mahatvakankshi yojanaon main ek he
 Under this, there is a provision to provide free LPG connection to poor families
 pehle khaanaa banane ke liye lakdi, gobar ke upale aadi kii vyavastha main kadi mashkkat kerani padati thi, jisase bahut adhik samay or mehnat lagati thi
 The smoke emanating from wood and dimples affected the health of the whole family
 ab garib pariwaron ko gas chulhaa mil jane se bacchon kaa manapsand khaanaa or vyanjan jaldi ban jate hai
 Health is also taken care of
 is tarah kii baaten kai mahilaon ne pradhanmantri ke man kii baat kaarykram main uthaai hai
 8- Corruption was the biggest issue for BJP and Narendra Modi
 narendra modi hameshaa kehete rahe ki purv kii sarkaron se unki sarkaar bhinn rahi kyonki kisi bhi mantri yaa netaa par ratti bhar aniyamitata kaa aarope nahin laga
 Narendra Modi in his speeches mentions many corruption of the Congress, ranging from Bofors, 2G to the Commonwealth Scam
 chunaav prachaar ke ant main unhone purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko 'bhrashtachari number-1' tak kah diya jis par kaaphi hangaamaa hua
 However, the Congress raised the issue of Rafale deal in response to Bofors and presented it as the main point of its campaign
 rahul gandhi ne 'chaukeedaar chor he' kaa naaraa diya or isi ke ird-gird wo narendra modi sarkaar ko 'bhrasht' bataate rahe
 Rahul Gandhi's 'chowkidar' was taken as an opportunity by Narendra Modi and in response he launched the 'main Bhi Hoon Chowkidar' campaign
 bijepi ke mutabik yah abhiyaan kaamyaab rahaa jiskaa phayda voton ke rup main use mila
 9-'mahilvati leader ', Prime Minister Narendra Modi was heard in his speeches referring to' great leaders'
 unhone bataaya ki centre se bijepi sarkaar ko hataane or narendra modi ko haraane ke liye vipakshi netaa ek ho gaye hai
 About them, he said that the leaders who used to curse each other, have now become one to defeat them
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki jin netaaon par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai, jo vanshavaad ko badhaava dete rahe hai, jo jamaanat par hai, jo kisi bhi surat main satta paanaa chaahate hai, ve sabhi netaa unhen haraane ke liye ek ho gaye hai
 According to the Prime Minister, there is complete opposition on one side and Modi alone on the other side
 10-sushasanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne sushasan kaa naaraa diya
 As the Prime Minister said in Khargone on 17 May, i am happy that the people of the country are carrying on the inspiration of patriotism, the philosophy of Antyodaya and the mantra of good governance and expressing their faith in the BJP
 aatankwaad or naksalwad ko khatm karne kii patibaddhta ko janata kaa bharpoor samarthan mil rahaa he
 The feeling of the country is that terrorists should enter the house and be killed
 sushasan ke mudde ko pradhanmantri ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ke janmdin se joda or 25 disbanr ko sushasan diwas manaane kii ravaayat shuru kii
