 The politics of Rajasthan has been dominated by Brahmin leaders for a long time
 pradesh main kabhi congress kii raajnneetik dhuree brahmanon ke ird-gird gumti thi, lekin vakt ke saath kamjor hui
 In such a situation, the Congress has once again made a strategy to address its traditional voters
 yahi vajah he ki seepi joshi jahaan khule taur par brahmanon ko raajnneeti kaa sirmaur maanate hai
 At the same time, Rahul has also played the Brahmin card on the pretext of his caste
 vidhansabha chunaav kii jang fatah karne utre congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko pushkar kii brahma mandir main vidhivat puja kii
 During this, Rahul revealed his gotra
 pushkar main rahul gandhi ne kaul brahman or dattatreya gotra ke naam se puja kii
 Rahul's first Congress leader CP Joshi played the Brahmin caste
 kuch dinon pehle hi ek jansabha main seepi joshi ne kaha tha, 'uma bharti ji kii jati maaloom he kisi ko? rutambhraa kii jati maaloom he? is desh main dharm ke bare main koi jaanata he to pandit jaanate hai
 'in such a situation, the question arises that will the Brahmin card of the Congress make the return to state power easier? The influence of Brahmins in 30 seats Congress in Rajasthan has big faces like CP Joshi, Girija Vyas and Raghu Sharma as Brahmin faces
 pradesh main 8 percent vot brahman samaaj kaa he
 The Brahmin voter is in a decisive role in about 30 assembly seats in the state
 congress ne rajasthan main party prabharee kii kaman avinaash pandeya ke haathon main he
 Apart from this, Raghu Sharma is also the chairman of Congress Election Campaign Committee in the state
 aazaadee ke baad congress ke 5 brahman siemzadee ke baad se lekar 90 ke dashak tak rajasthan congress main brahman netaaon kaa sunaharaa daur rahaa tha
 Five Brahmins had become Chief Ministers since Independence to 1990
 1949 se lekar 1990 tak rajasthan kii raajnneeti main brahman netaaon kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 In 1990, Haridev Joshi was the last CM and since then the dominance of Brahmins in the politics of Rajasthan has reduced
 haalanki, rajya main congress ke sabase pramukh chehre ke taur par party mahasachiv ashok gahalot or sachin payalat kii hoti he
 Both these faces do not come from the Brahmin community
 yahi vajah rahi gahalot ko ek kaarykram main kahana padaa ki rajasthan main siem ke liye congress ke do hi nahin balki paanch chehre or bhi hai
 In these, he enumerated the names of three Brahmin faces
 brahmanon par daanvrajasthan kii 200 vidhansabha siton main tikat kii agar baat kii jaae to congress ne brahman samaaj se 20 logon ko is baar ummidavaar banaaya he
 Whereas in the last election, the Brahmin community was given 17 tickets and the Lok Sabha did not have one
 haalanki, upachunaav main congress ne ajmer loksabhaa seat par raghu sharma ko ummidavaar banaaya tha or unhone jeet hasil kar party kaa khaataa kholaa he
 Congress has again played Brahmin bets
 bataa den ki 1990 ke baad se lagaataar rajasthan kii raajnneeti main brahman jati kaa dabadabaa kam hota aayaa he
 However, different Brahmin leaders have held important positions in Rajasthan from time to time
 lekin phir bhi 1990 ke baad se koi bhi mukhyamantri ke pad par nahin pahunch paaya he
 Talking about the prominent Brahmin leaders of Rajasthan, Naval Kishore Sharma was an important name after Haridev Joshi
 haalanki naval kishor sharma ne centre kii raajnneeti main apni bhoomika adaa kii
 After this the Brahmin faces of the Congress have been leaving their influence in the present politics like CP Joshi, Girija Vyas, Raghu Sharma, Mahesh Joshi, Bhanwarlal Sharma
 ajmer loksabhaa ke upachunaav main raghu sharma ko mili jeet bataati he kii rajasthan main ab bhi brahman raajnneeti ke liye paryaapt spes baaki he
 If tickets are given on the basis of caste equations, it is not possible to ignore the Brahmin society for a long time
 brahmanon kaa sunaharaa daurbata den ki 1949 se lekar 1951 tak rajasthan ke pehle mukhyamantri heeralaal shastri rahe
 After that Jayanarayan Vyas became the Chief Minister from 1951 to 1952
 march 1952 se oktober 1952 tak tikaaram paliwal mukhyamantri rahe
 From November 1952 to November 1954 Jayanarayan Vyas served as the Chief Minister
 iske baad agast 1973 se april 1977 tak haridev joshi ne mukhyamantri pad kii kaman sanbhali
 From March 1985 to January 1988, Haridev Joshi once again became the Chief Minister
 iske baad rajasthan main brahman mukhyamantri ke taur par disambar 1989 se march 1990 tak haridev joshi kaa aakhri kaarykaal rahaa
 After this, the politics of Rajasthan turned in a different direction
 congress kii kaman ashok gahalot ke haathon main aa gai or vahiin bijepi kii ore se rajput netaa ke taur par pehle bhaironsingh shekhavat or phir vasundhara raaje ne mukhyamantri pad sambhala

 Toss played a key role, he said
 jab ham gendbaaji ke liye aae, to kaaphi os pad rahi thi or isse sthiti bighad gai
 He said, scoring and rotating strikes on this pitch was not easy
 jab vah khel rahe the, tab bhi hamane aisa dekha
 If there was no dew, the target of 289 runs would have been like 400 on this pitch, because there was a lot of turn and bounce here
 darren braavo ne kaha, yah hamaare liye karo yaa maro vaala match tha
 Our bowlers performed well and our fielding was also good

 lekin rajya main pehali badi aatanki vaardaat, bodhgaya ke dhamaakon kii jaanch rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ko saunp di, jisamen do log gambhir rup se ghayal hue the
 On July 17, Nitish was held guilty by the principal in the case of the death of 23 children from a poisonous mid-day meal at a school in Saran
 unke paas is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin tha ki biimaar bacchon ko behatar ilaaj ke liye patna pahunchane main saat ghante kyon lag gaye?aatank par sustapichley kuch maheenon se iem ne bihar ko thikaana or nishaanaa bana rakhaa he
 But under Nitish's rule, the Bihar police is clearly evasive in dealing with this challenge directly
 is susti ke peeche bihar main muslim samarthan khone kaa dar bataaya jaataa he
 In August this year, a senior IPS officer, who was going to East Champaran to interrogate IM mastermind Yasin Bhatkal, caught in the action of the IB and the state police, was asked to return in the midst of the yatra
 unke aakaaon ne unase kaha ki bhatkal kii jaanch se bihar kaa kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 After that the Bihar Police also handed over the investigation of the Bodh Gaya blast to the NIA and withdrew from taking credit for the arrest of Bhatkal
 bhatkal homeopathy doctor imran ke naam se madhubani or darbhanga jilon main varshon rahaa tha or koi darjanabhar muslim yuvakon ke saath usne ek aatanki modul taiyaar kiya tha
 Says a senior IPS officer, "any other police would have taken Bhatkal and his partner Haddi on remand to trace their contacts in the state, but the Bihar police overcame them
" ''modi kii patna raily main suraksha main khamiyaan thim or aatanki berokatoke ghaatak bam rakhane main kaamyaab hue
 The state did not care about the intelligence gained from Bhatkal's interrogation
 is jaankaree ke mutabik, uskaa saathi tahseen akhtar urf monu bam dhamaakon kii sajeesh rach rahaa he
 Monu is believed to be the mastermind of the blasts at Gandhi Maidan on 27 October
 lekin abhi vah faraar he
 Chhoti Parnitish started his second term as the Chief Minister of Bihar in 2010 with a convincing victory
 chunaav main jedy(you)-bijepi gathjod ne 2005 se kaaphi behatar pradarshan kiya
 It won 206 seats in the 243-member assembly and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and the Congress were almost wiped out
 is jeet ke tatkaal baad nitish ne saarvajanik sevaaon ko samay par uplabdh karaane ke liye seva adhikaar adhinium jaise kai kalyankari kaaryakramon kaa sutarapaat kiya or bahuvivaadit vidhayak vikaas nidhi kii vyavastha ko khatm kiya
 His decline in popularity probably began in September 2012, when 2,50,000 Shikshamitra school teachers started building Nitish's Adhikar Yatra, a platform to express their displeasure over the difference in pay from permanent teachers
 mukhyamantri jahaan bhi gaye unhen kaale jhande dikhaae gaye or unke kafile par patharav kiya gaya
 This led to Nitish government bowing out and the salary of Shikshamitras from September 2013 to Rs 3,000
 kii vruddhi ko manjuuri de di
 Last year itself, Nitish started raising pangs from the central government to get special status for Bihar
 haalanki upie sarkaar se abhi tak rajya ko aisa koi darja hasil nahin ho paaya he
 It is common in Patna's political circles that the Chief Minister wants some kind of a solution to save his face from the Center, but the Congress is asking him a firm promise to ally with the Third Front and tie up with him
 yah bhi charchaa he ki nitish ne congress ke saath yah samjhauta kar liya he ki ve upie-2 ke raaj main hue bhrashtachar, ghotaalon or bekaabu mahangaai par apana munh nahin kholenge
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan says, "nitish is begging the Center to grant special status to Bihar so that he can maintain his stature in the state
" lekin logon kaa unase mohabhang dur nahin ho saktaa, chaahe ve rajya ko hajaaron karod ru
 Why not get a package of ''haalanki nitish ne hameshaa hi pradhanmantri banane kii aakanksha se inkaar kiya he, lekin ve congress or sambhavit tisare morche ke bich jhulate dikh rahe hai, taaki jahaan behatar molbhav ho jaae, us paale main ja khadey hon
 On 30 October, he fueled speculation of going to a non-congress, non-bjp Third Front
 ve vampanthi dalon kii aguai main nai dilli ke talkatoraa stadium main 14 partiyon ke netaaon ke saath 'sampradayikta ke viruddh jan ekta sammelan' main hissaa lene pahunche
 He said there, "we have to think and unite against communalism, terrorism and fascism
" '' samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke pramukh mulaayam singh yadav kii bagal main baithkar nitish ne ''gaiyr-sampradayik partiyon'' ke saath jedy (you) ke kaam karne par jor diya
 This is the first major change of his political journey
 unhone november, 2012 se bihar ke vishesh darje kii maang ke liye apni adhikaar yatra ke dauraan congress se galabahiyaan badhaani shuru kii thi
 Bihar BJP president Sushil Kumar Modi says, "nitish kept waiting for an economic package from the UPA government for almost a year, after which he moved towards the non-existent Third Front
 isse mahaj unki asuraksha kaa hi sanket miltaa he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki unke paas rajya kii sabhi 40 sansadeey siton ke liye yogya ummidavaar tak nahin hai
 "behind Nitish's friction from Congress towards the Third Front, there is probably a feeling that the Congress is indeed a burden in Bihar
 do saansadon or chaar vidhayakon ke saath congress kii koi chunavi takat nahin he
 So, Nitish may be thinking that the Third Front also has no electoral existence in Bihar but it is not a burden either
 vahiin, congress ke saath jane par unhen upie-2 main bhrashtachar or bekaabu mahangaai ke tikhe sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Also, if a third front comes into existence, Nitish will join Mulayam Singh Yadav to cut Lalu Prasad Yadav and his RJD
 phir, jedy (you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav kaa congress ke khilaaf tikhaa rujhaan bhi nitish ke liye ek samasya he
 Sharad Yadav has also started offering arms recently
 unhone july main nitish se puche bagaiyr shivanand tiwari ko party mahasachiv or pravaktaa kii dohari jimmedaariyon se mukt kar diya tha
 Nitish cannot ignore his national president in the election season as Yadav is the most powerful vote bank in the state
 astitv kii ladaalaktubar ke dhamaakon ne bhale nitish kii kushal prashaasak kii chhavi par dhabba laga diya ho lekin yah unki chintaaon main sabase kam mahatv rakhata he
 In June, he was able to muster a simple majority in the 243-member assembly with the support of four independents and as many Congress mlas, but he could not expand his cabinet due to fears of a mess in the ministerial race
 isse jedy (you) main unke virodhiyon ko unki kamajori kaa ehsaas ho gaya
 At a JD (U) strategic conference on June 29, Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwari praised Narendra Modi while Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh accused Nitish of being surrounded by some bureaucrats, and challenged himself to be sacked
 lekin nitish kii ore se koi jawaab nahin aayaa jo june se hi baari boj dhone vaale mukhyamantri ban gaye hai
 Nitish currently has 18 departments including important departments like Roads and Construction, Finance, Health and Tourism besides Home and Personnel Departments
 ek varisht iees adhikari kehete hai, ''unhone apane upar itnaa boj le liya he ki use nibhaa paanaa asambhav he
 In August, Nitish did not remove his two ministers, Bhim Singh and Narendra Singh, despite insensitive statements on the killing of five Indian soldiers by Pakistanis along the Jammu Line of Control
 bhim singh ne kaha tha ki 'jawan to shahid hone ke liye hi sena main bhartee hote hai
 On the same side, Narendra Singh described Pakistan as "the younger brother of India" and said that extremists on the border carried out the incident, which the Government of Pakistan has no control over
 gandhi maidan kii raily main modi ne 'aise paapiyon ko sajaa' dene kaa aahvaan kiya
 On 31 October, Revenue Minister Ramai Ram again raised the demand for Lok Sabha candidate from Hajipur
 abhi vahaan se jedy(you) ke ramsundar das loksabhaa sadsy hai
 Needless to say that such an open rebellion in the party could not be imagined till a few months ago
 isse bhi badtar sthiti to yah he ki punerjeevit bijepi ne un par baari dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya he
 It has 91 mlas and is preparing to make a dent in Nitish's original vote bank of the most backward castes and Mahadalits
 yahi nahin, modi ko ati pichhadi jatiyon ke netaa ke rup main project kiya ja rahaa he
 Nitish's old rival RJD is also challenging the JD (U) by recovering from the jail sentence of Lalu Prasad in the fodder scam
 do jedy (you) saansadon puuranamasi ram or manganilaal mandal ne khulkar lalu kii tarif kii he or donon argedy main shaamil hone ke sanket bhi de rahe hai
 Also, MP Jayanarayan Nishad and MLA Chedi Paswan met Modi in August and September and gave clear indications of joining the BJP
 is saal june main bijepi se tuutane ke baad nitish ne apane cabinet sahyogiyon se kaha tha ki unhone bijepi se to bas lalu ko hataane ke liye haath milaayaa tha
 He had said, "when you have to extinguish a big fire, you don't see what the water is like
" aag bujhane ke liye jo milegaa, use hi uthaa lenge
 "of course, Bihar today needs fire extinguishers, but there are options open

 com / yb9loc3owk— t2 (@t2telegraph)may 16, 2016 If diplomacy were a game of chess, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi would undoubtedly be playing with white pieces
 satta main aane ke pichley dedh saal main unhone kootneeti kaa ek moulik, urjasvi, hamalavar or ati-sakriy sanskaran viksit kiya he jisamen ek doordarshee netaa, ek celsman or ek rangakarmi kaa thodaa-thodaa aks dikhaai detaa he lekin kul milakar vah hota bahut jaandaar he
 In the process of doing this, Modi has changed the international narrative about India & which was once a staggering country, has turned into an emerging global force today
 pichley 27 sitambar ko san hoje main jab unhone apravasi bharatiyon se khachaakhach bhare stadium ko sambodhit kiya, to yah ek rangamanch se kam nahin jaan padataa tha
 Amidst the heavy reception and noise, Modi appeared on stage, before a group of desi dancers entertained people with Bollywood songs
 us kshetra ke darjan bhar america congress ke sadsy unke abhinandan main qatari lagaae khadey the, jisamen house of ripregentatica kii minurity netaa nancy pelocy bhi thim
 Modi soon filled the crowd with his traditional desi anecdotes and intimate style of speech
 yah unmaad jab apane charam par pahunchaa, tab modi ne saadhaaran shabdon main is duniya ke bare main apni samajhadaari logon ke saamne rakhi
 He said that everyone agrees that the twenty-first century belongs to Asia, but of late, it is now being said that this century will belong to India
 phir unhone poocha ki aisa kyon hoga? or bheed chilla uthi, “modi, modi
 "he laughed and he replied," No, no
 modi ke kaaran nahin
 This change has come because of you & billions of people who are now believing that India should not be left behind any more
 yah vakt aa gaya he ki bharat duniya kaa netritv kare
 "modi actually wants to transform India's role as a balancing force into a" leadership force "
 ve maanate hai ki aisa desh jahaan maanavtaa kaa chatha hissaa nivas karata he or jo jald hi duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha banane ja rahaa he, use uskaa sahi mukaam hasil ho
 Modi also understands that the US is now on the decline, while China is faltering, India has the best chance to lead the world as it is the largest democracy in the world, provided it leaves its cards correctly
 
 isi darje kii talash kaa ek hissaa he sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (yuanessi) kii sthaayee sadsyta, jiske liye modi ne koi kasar nahin chodi he
 The proposal has been pending since 2005
 yuanessi kootnithik takaton kaa ek samooh he jisamen philhal sirf paanch sthaayee sadsy hai jinke paas vito ke adhikaar hai&america, britain, france, rus or china
 Of all the heads of state that Modi met in New York, one of the people he met became a subject of great curiosity, Ralph Gonzalvis, the President of a small Caribbean island named Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, which is a hundred times less than Delhi
 modi par fabtiyaan kasi gayi ki bade deshon main unase kuch hi milane ke icchhuk hai, isliye ve chote-chote dwipon ke rashtradhyakshon se mil rahe hai
 Modi also had a purpose behind this
 suraksha parishad main bharat kaa pravesh rokane ke china or pakistan ke prayaason ko bharat ne haal hi main naakaam kar diya tha, jab usne sanyukt raashtra kii mahasabha main text-aadhaarit samjhauton ke aadhaar par parishad ke vistaar par mat sangrah main jeet hasil kii thi
 The President of St
 Vincent and the Grenadines were among the outspoken supporters of the proposal
 yuanessi main pravesh ke liye bharat ko 193 sadasyon vaali mahasabha ke do-tihaai sadasyon kaa samarthan chahie
 Therefore, every country has importance and Modi's team is working on the votes of these countries like a general election, small countries are also being wooed
 modi ne apni hi party ke sahyogi, purv videsh mantri yashavanth sinha kii aalochana ko bhi darkinar kar diya, jinhone india today tivi ko die saakshaatkaar main sarkaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki vah yuanessi main pravesh ke avastavik daawey kar rahi he
 Sinha termed the "begging" of G4 countries (brazil, Germany, India and Japan) to gain entry into UNSC as "disgraceful"
 is aalochana ko pare rakhte hue modi ne bade saahas ke saath ji-4 deshon ke netaaon&germany kii angela mercel, japan ke shinjo ebe or brazil kii dilma rusef kii ek shikhar baithak bula lee or aktubar main shuru ho rahe parishad ke 70wein varsh ke utsav main uske vistaar ke abhiyaan par unhen raji kar liya
 Soon after Modi met US President Barack Obama and this was his fifth meeting with the most powerful man in the world after becoming Prime Minister, and he reminded Obama that he had promised to support India in terms of permanent membership
 pichley saal hui inaki duusari mulaakaat main obama ne modi ko agar “main of acshan” kaha tha to yah aise hi nahin tha
 The manner in which Modi conducts diplomacy is completely opposite to Manmohan Singh's style
 manmohan ko videsh niti ke maamle main kuch saahasik pahalon kaa shrey jaataa he jisamen ek bharat-america parmaanu qaraar bhi he, lekin ve hameshaa vinamr rahete the or apane lakshyon kaa peechha bahut shant rahakar karte the
 In terms of understanding on economic matters, Manmohan had a great reputation, but when the opportunity of summits came, he confined himself to the speeches prepared by his colleagues
 unki style bahut kuch us mashhoor “24 akshar” kii salaah jaisi thi jo deng shiyao ping ne chini rajanyikon ko di thiah “thande dimag se chizon ko dekho-samajho, sadhi hui pratikriya do, majbootee se khadey raho, apni samarthy ko chhupaao or apni baari kii pratiksha karo, kabhi bhi aguai karne kii koshish mat karo or kuch hasil karke aao
 "in contrast, Modi is not averse to taking risks and he continues to question the need to remain neutral
 ve paramparaagat tareekon se hatakar vyavhaar karne ko taiyaar rahete hai, jaisaa ki unhone france ke apane daure par 36 rafaal ladaaku vimaanon ko kharid kar kiya, jiskaa sauda do dashakon se lataka padaa tha
 They do not hesitate to attack and aggressively pursue India's national interest, as they did by sending troops to search for rebels from the northeast within Myanmar
 modi “sabase pehle pratikriya” dene ko uddhat rahete hai, jaisaa ki hamane nepal main aae bukamp or yaman main paidaa asthirataa ke dauraan dekha tha jab unhone teji se maanviya raahat or aapadaa raahat abhiyaanon ko ravaanaa kar diya tha
 He has also expressed India's willingness to undertake major responsibilities when recently he pledged to send more troops from India for the United Nations Peace Keeping Force
 modi banaam manmohanmodi apni videsh yatraaon kii yojana aise banaate hai goyaa ve pradhanmantri pad ke liye prachaar karne ja rahe hon
 This approach is the opposite of Manmohan Singh
 america kii sitambar yatra kii taiyaari unhone maheenon pehle kerani shuru kar di thi
 He used to ask officials on important issues and countries about power point presentations and the results, "after listening to the briefing," Modi remembers the information and prepares how to deal with the situation What else to say
 unke ek sahyogi kii tippanee he, “ve taiyaar sandeshon ke hisaab se nahin chalate balki sandeshon ko apane hisaab se chalaate hai
 "modi also goes into the details of what gifts are to be given to the recipients
 america kii sheersh companiyon ke siio se apni mulaakaat ke baad unhen adivasee kala kaa ek smarak dene kii yojana thi jise modi ne radd kar diya or apni team se kaha ki ve aisa gajet dena chaahate hai jo maid in india” ho jisase desh kii utpaadan or praudyogikeey takat kaa pradarshan ho sake
 a large army of BJP supporters went to America before Modi, whose job was to plan a dialogue with Modi, along with the immigrant Indians there
 isi ke tahat san hoje stadium main rock concert style main ek raily kaa khaakaa bana, jisaki 18,000 kursiyon ke liye dedh lakh aavedan praapt hue
 In addition to the crucial meeting with Obama, Modi had told his team that he should have a meeting with more and more heads of state and businessmen
 modi bina thake hue lagaataar baithak or daure karte rahe
 a senior diplomat compared him to a swan who swims on the surface of a lake, but his speed seems unfounded because his feet are constantly moving underwater
 is sab kaa parinaam yah rahaa ki kootneeti kii duniya ko modi ne akele lut liyaah america main bitaye apane paanch dinon ke bheetar unhone do baar sanyukt raashtra main sambodhan diya, 30 deshon ke rashtradhyakshon se mulaakaat kii jinamein bade or chote sabhi desh the, america ke 50 se zyada sheersh siio ke saath samvaad kiya jo 4 kharab dollar se zyada kaarobaar vaali companiyon ke mukhiya hai, silicon vaili kii aitihaasik shakhsiyaton ke saath bhojan kiya jisamen fasebuk ke sansthaapak mark jukerbarg ke saath tounhall main hua ek samvaad bhi shaamil tha
 In addition, he spent considerable time with large groups of immigrant Indians in New York and California
 andaaj yaa madda?nitiyon ke jaankaar ab bhi is par bante hue hai ki modi ne vaaki bharat ke tareekon main koi buniyadi badlaav laa diya he yaa phir tamaam agar-magar ke baavjood ve mote taur par apane purvavarti kii banaai nitiyon par hi chal rahe hai
 In his recent statements, Foreign Secretary S
W
 jaishankar kaa saaf maananaa tha ki modi ke aane se videshon main bharat kaa udhyam “pehle kii tarah nahin rah gaya he balki usamen zyada aatmavishvaas aayaa he, pahalen hui hai, drudh sankalp dikhaa he or jaahir taur se inamen bharat kii samarthy kii vruddhi dikhaai detii he
 In many cases, it can be said that the impression of India has been strong and wide
 ”america videsh niti ke jaankaar stephen kohen kii raay alag he

 And the increase may be such that the waist of the people is broken

 Just like diesel prices are
 rasoi gas par sabsidi khatm karne or tel companiyon kaa ghaataa kam karne ke liye sarkaar ke paas dheron prastaav hai jisamen se ek prastaav ye bhi he ki alpiji kii keemat har maheene 10 rupee badhaai jaae
 These increases will continue until the losses of the oil companies are met and the cylinder prices do not reach the market prices
 abhi to sarkaar ke jatke kii jhaanki he
 There are many decisions that burn the pocket
 aane vaale dinon main aapaki rasoi kaa bajet bad saktaa he
 Maybe you have to pay more for the government cooking gas cylinders or it is possible that your subsidized cylinders will be reduced
 darasal, saalon se sarkaar par tel companiyon ke ghate kam karne kaa dabaav he
 For which many suggestions have been made - some of them are - the subsidy on cylinders should be reduced in one stroke
 yaa phir sabsidi vaale silendar kii sankhya kam kii jaae yaa dijal kii tarah har maheene sabsidi vaale silendar par kareeb 10 rupee kii badhotaree kii jaae
 Or implement the two options together
 ab padhie ki rasoi gas kii vajah se tel companiyon ko kitna ghaataa ho rahaa he or sarkaar par sabsidi kaa boj kitna batch rahaa he
 a cylinder of LPG costs around Rs 900, while people have to pay Rs 425 on average
 475 rupee kaa ghaataa hota he
 The current situation is worse
 dollar ke mukaable rupaya kamjor he or iraq yuddh kii vajah se kachche tel kii keemton main badhotaree ho rahi he
 It is important to see the loss of LPG in both these situations
 agar dollar ke mukaable rupaya ek point kamjor hota he to alpiji kaa ghaataa badhkar 700 karod rupee salanaa ho jaataa he or agar kachche tel kii keemat main ek dollar prati bairal kii badhotaree hoti he to alpiji kaa ghaataa badhkar 400 karod rupee salanaa ho jaataa he
 The government has already removed the subsidy on petrol
 dijal main bhi har maheene 50 paise kii badhotaree kii ja rahi he
 Efforts have been made to fix the limit of subsidized cylinders in LPG but this does not work
 lihaaja sarkaar kuch or kade faisle le sakati he
 Although it is for the government to decide what measures should be taken to reduce the subsidy burden and to help the oil companies recover from the losses - but experts believe that the government will take care that the burden on the public pocket is reduced

 Strange because gold is being bought more expensively, then the inflation rate has also increased
 haa, pataakhon kii bikri kii baat karen to dilli main mahangaai ne isaki kharidari par grahan laga diya he

 On the occasion of Dhanteras, there has been a 25 per cent increase in gold purchases in Delhi and Mumbai compared to 2011
 mumbai main dhanteras ke din 2500 kilo sona logon ne kharida jisaki rupye main keemat 750 karod rahi
 In Noida, adjacent to Delhi, gold has been purchased for 100 crores rupees on the day of Dhanteras, whereas in 2011 gold worth only 50 crores was sold, which means that there was a 100% jump in purchases
 ahmedabad main bhi dhanteras ke din 300 kilo sona dukaan se logon ke ghar pahunchaa jo pichley saal se zyada he
 However, the inflation bomb in the city of Nawabs has affected people's pockets
 lakhanu main dhanteras par 200 kilo sona bika jabaki 2011 main 250 kilo sona kharida gaya tha
 There has been a decrease of 25 percent
 ham aapako ye bhi bataa den ki pichley ek saal main sone kii keemat main prati 10 gram kareeb 5 hajaar rupye kii badhotaree hui he
 In November 2011, the price of 10 grams of gold was around 27 thousand rupees, whereas in November 2012, 10 grams of gold is being sold at a price of 32 thousand rupees
 sone kii kharidari to alag alag shaharon main mili juli rahi lekin dilli main pataakhaa market graahakon kii baat joh rahaa he
 According to the figures, the sale of firecrackers in Delhi has decreased by 50 per cent this year as the prices of firecrackers have increased by 30 to 50 per cent in a year

 Vice President Venkaiah Naidu said on Wednesday that there should not be enmity in politics
 unhone kaha ki raajnneeti main itani dushmani nahin honi chahie ki ek party ke log duusari party ke logon ke yahaan shaadi-byaah yaa matam main na shaamil hon
 Actually, Vice President Congress leader Abhishek Manu was speaking in Delhi on the occasion of the release of Manu Singhvi's book 'straight Talk'
 venkaiya naidu ne bagal main baithi diemke kii saansad kanimojhi kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha, 'raajnneeti main itani dushmani nahin honi chahie, jaisi tamilnadu main he, jahaan se kanimojhi aati hai
 Such a situation is seen in many parts of the country, where people of one party do not go to the other even at weddings and deaths
 'uparashtrapati ne kaha, 'siyaasi dalon ko yaad rakhana chahie ki ve ek-duusare ke pratidwandi hai na ki dushman
 This is the most depressing picture of today's politics, where people consider each other as enemies
 hamen samajhnaa chahie ki harek dal apane anusaar behatar karne kii koshish karata he
 He said, 'there should be a debate on the relationship between the parties
 kisne kaha ki hamen sirf sarkaar kaa samarthan yaa virodh karnaa chahie, lekin kam se kam har masale par charchaa to honi hi chahie
 At the same time, Kanimozhi said to Aaj Tak on Venkaiah's statement- 'earlier this used to happen, but now it is not so
 ammaa canteen sahi se nahin chal rahi lekin phir bhi ham us concept kaa swaagat karte hai
 Reliable Naidu told EVM that five years ago Abhishek Manu Singhvi had written a book called 'candid Corner', but now he has written 'strat Talk' which tells the political picture of the present time
 uparashtrapati ne kaha, 'vastav main yah hamaare liye chunauti he ki aazaadee ke 70 saal baad bhi desh main 25 fisadi log garibi rekha se neeche jivan yaapan karne ko majaboor hai
 Naidu also expressed his views on the electoral process in the country
 unhone kaha, 'chunaav sambandhi shikayaton ko nipataane ke liye vishesh adaalaton kaa gathan kiya janaa chahie
 Normally, decisions come after the term of the Parliament or Assembly members is over
 'uparashtrapati ne iviem ko chunaav karaane kaa sahi jariya bataaya
 He said, 'it is clearly written in Abhishek Manu Singhvi's book that despite all the allegations, conducting elections with EVM is the most reliable and it gives almost right results
 'baad main abhishek manu singhvi ne iviem ke masale par safai di
 He said, 'my article which the Vice President has mentioned is 4-5 years old
 pichley 3-4 saalon main iviem ko lekar tamaam gadabadiyaan saamne ai hai
 Kairana is in front, even before this, many complaints have come up

 a year before the 2019 elections, the ongoing tussle over seats in the Bihar NDA continues
 jediu or bijepi ke bich baat banati dikh nahin rahi he
 While JDU is demanding 25 seats, BJP is not ready to contest less than 22 seats
 baavjood iske jediu endie ke ghatak dalon ke bich vyapak samjhaute kii ummid lagaae hue he, taaki 2019 ke loksabhaa or 2020 main bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye prayek party kii siton kii hissedari nirdhaarit ho
 According to sources, the JDU wants the BJP to take the initiative on seat sharing among all the NDA allies in Bihar in time, so that the election can be done with full preparation
 haalanki bijepi kii ore se abhi tak koi prastaav nahin aayaa he
 According to the report of the English newspaper Indian Express, in Bihar, when JDU and BJP together wanted to fight in both elections
 us samay jediu kii siton kaa number tay nahin kiya gaya tha
 He said that we want all the parties to sit together and fix the seat share of the parties
 sabhi sahyogi dalon ko uchit, nishpaksh or maujuuda jamini raajnneeti kii hakeekat ko samajhate hue faisla kiye jaaen
 Let us know that in the 2014 elections, BJP won 22
 party pichley loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaam ke aadhaar par hi samjhauta karnaa chaahati hai
 JDU is considering this premise of BJP as wrong
 jediu ne kaha ki ye baat yaad rakhana hoga ki 2019 ko 2014 na samajha jaae
 He underscored the fact that "the results of the by-elections indicate that there has been a change in public mood
 unhone kaha kiandie ko bihar se 40 loksabhasiton main se 31 milin thi jo ki 243 vidhansabha kshetron main se 173 par jeet hasil kii thi
 The BJP alone got 22 seats
 sutron ke mutabik kya is nateezon ko doharaaya ja saktaa he
 He said that JDU had secured only two seats
 is lihaaj se kya hamen do siton par ummidavaar utaarne honge
 JDU sources said that if the results are to be scaled for the seat sharing, then the outcome of the 2015 assembly elections should be decided
 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 53 or jediu ne 71siten jiti thi
 He said, "ram Vilas Paswan's LJP has six members in the Lok Sabha, but Bihar has only two mlas, while Upendra Kushwaha's party RLSP had three seats in the Lok Sabha but only two members in the assembly
 kya ve is lihaaj se siton kii sankhya ke bantwaare se santusht honge
 Sources said that a holistic approach and a pragmatic approach make more sense
 bijepi ko endie ko apane sahyogiyon se paraamarsh karne or samay-samay par chintaaon ko dur karne ke liye kadam uthaane chahie
 He has no representation of JDU in the central government
 jabaki bihar sarkaar main bijepi kaa acchhee tarah se pratinidhitiv he
 According to the JDU, if such a situation persists in Bihar, then it will eliminate the possibility of alliance in the state

 After the dissolution of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, all parties are preparing for the assembly elections
 purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne neshnal conference ke saath sambhavit gathbandhan ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki jammu-kashmir kii samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pidipi kaa ek prastaav he or us prastaav ke maddenjar wo kisi bhi party se haath milaane ko taiyaar hai
 Let us tell you that Omar Abdullah, the leader of the National Conference, has refused any pre-poll alliance with any party
 lekin pidipi kii mukhiya ne kaha ki jab hamane bijepi ke saath haath milaayaa to ham ek prastaav lekar saath aae the
 But he knew that the government would not run for many days with the BJP
 unhone kaha ki jab bijepi se haath milaayaa ja saktaa he to kashmir ke samaadhaan ke liye kisi bhi party se haath milaane ko taiyaar hai
 Mehbooba Mufti said that earlier Kashmir problem was not considered as mainstream problem
 lekin purv mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne kashmir kii samasya ko menstream kiya
 He said that when Mufti Saheb left the Congress to form the PDP, the motive behind it was to find a solution to the problem of Kashmir in which everyone's voice should be included
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke samarthan vaapasi ke badajammu-kashmir main mahububasarkaar gir gai thi, lekin rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang nahin kii thi
 a few months after the fall of the government, when the PDP, NC and the Congress came together and claimed to form the government, the Governor dissolved the Assembly citing a change in scale in a very dramatic development

 Sanjay Dutt may not enjoy Salman Khan's level of stardom but he has managed to make films on his own
 haalanki bich-bich main lachar scripts ke chalate unki filmon kii saxes kii nirantarata main kami dekhne ko mili, yahi kaaran he ki jail se baahar aane ke baad bhoomi or sahib bibi or gangster jaisi filmein darshakon ke bich paith nahin bana pai lekin netflix or global strimming content ke daur main bhi sanju baba ek thik-thaak film ko hit karaane kaa madda rakhte hai, prasthaanam bhi usee film kii baangi ho sakati he
 Story: Bahubali MLA Baldev Pratap Singh (sanjay Dutt) of Aminabad is famous all over the city due to his influence
 unhen ye seat bhi kaaphi vivaadaaspad tareeke se mili thi
 There used to be another person MLA from Aminabad who was killed by an enemy gang
 sanjay dutt naa keval is seat se jite balki unhone us netaa kii patni sukmini (manisha koirala) se shaadi bhi rachaai
 Ayush (ali Fazal) and Palak (chahat Khanna) are the children of Sukmini's first husband and are quite sensitive, and Sanjay Dutt's son Vivaan (satyajit Dubey) is addicted to power
 pyaar, lobh or power kii is ladaai main ek shaatir bijnesaman (bajva khatri) twists laate hai
 Baldev Pratap Singh, along with his son Hamraaz Driver (jackie Shroff) and Young Political Leader, is once again working hard to get the MLA chair, but can you see his efforts come true? Will have to turn to actinggodfadar or sarkaar jaisi filmon kii tarj par hi kahani kaa zyaadaatar plot donon beton ke ird gird hi ghumta rahata he
 Ali Fazal, who has done his acting as well as projects like Mirzapur and Victoria & Abdul, impresses with his performance in this film as well
 vahi sanjay dutt ke bete ke taur par kai baar over da top acting karte dikhte hai
 Perhaps because of working with powerful artists, they feel a bit nervous and away from natural acting
 lekin unka kirdaar khalataa nahin he or ve apni bhoomika ji le gaye hai
 a powerful leader but sensitive and insecure father, Sanjay Dutt showcases his acting range and then proves that he has the ability to adapt to any role
 haalanki film main manisha koirala kaa role kaaphi satahi or van diemensional he
 Not much work has been done on his character
 iske alaava amyra dastur or ali fazal kii lav story praasangik nahin lagati he
 Jackie Shroff looks good in his small but effective character
 dutt or jaiki kii screen par maujuudagi asardaar he
 No matter how much fun Chunky Pandey is offscreen, but after Saho, he again proves that he can do justice to negative characters
 diarectionakabir singh ke baad ye duusari aisi film he jise south ke diarector ne hi hindi main banane kii koshish kii he
 This formula was successful with Kabir Singh but director Deva Katta has failed to leave that level of impact
 upi ke balldrop par bani is film ke kai seens ko dekhakar ehsaas hota he ki diarector ne is jagah or kshetra ke pahaluon ko lekar bahut zyada research nahin kii he
 In the first half of the film, the flow of the film is good and the film progresses at a good pace, but in the second half the film slows down
 iske alaava climex bahut zyada prabhaavshaalee nahin gadha gaya he
 In the era of realist cinema, some dialogues also seem to be childish in many places according to today's era, which shows that a lot of hard work has not been done in creating more characters except some characters
 haalanki film kii cinematography prashansaneey he or kai wide shots ke sahare ek political thriller ko bhavy film kii feel detii he
 The film is good in the first half but performs well in pieces in the second half
 kyon dekhebhumi or sahib bibi or gangster ke baad is film ko sanjay dutt kaa behatar prayaas kaha ja saktaa he
 If you are a fan of Sanju Baba then it will not be right to miss this film
 iske saath hi ali fazal, jaiki shroff or chanki pandey kii acting ke liye bhi is film ko dekha ja saktaa he
 However, if you like top quality political melodramatic projects like Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, The Wire, you might be disappointed to see this film

 or ghantiyaan baj uthi hai—'times ap' (yani vakt khatm)
 Today, anger is sweeping across the world, with the India today-mdra sex survey done at workplaces in 19 cities across the country
 anaupchaarik or antarangaupar se dekhne par kaarysthalon kaa matlab he jimmedaariyaan, dedline, lakshya, baithken or haa, kaam kii jaanch-parakh
 But workplaces also mean people — we spend the largest part of our time in offices, talking, whispering and gossiping, pushing each other, making strategic alliances, making enemies or friends of a lifetime

 "sexual harassment at workplaces may have become a big issue, but do we accept the reality of consensual sexual relationships? How is it trending? What do people think about it? So, let this silence prevail behind modern workplaces Break, find out what the figures say
 ''kya aapako lagata he ki sahakarmiyon kaa yon rishta kaayam karnaa sahi he?" bahumat kahata he, ''nahin
 "but this is not a clear majority — 1 in every 2 people (56%) surveyed says 'no' and they are predominantly women (62%) ahead
" magar mard chatpataate maaloom dete hai—jitne aadmi khilaaf hai, thik utane hi aadmi (50%) kehete hai ki sahakarmiyon ko sex karne kii ijaajat milani chahie
 And this is where the matter really gets more interesting
 zyaadaatar logon (58%) ko lagata he ki unke mahaj 10 fisadi saathiyon ne hi apane saathiyon ke saath sex kiya he
 But in reality, three times (28%) of them have celebrated with their peers
 or jo baat echaar yani maanav sansaadhan peshewaron main shaayad thodi khalabali machaa sakati he, vah yah ki bos or maatahaton ke bich sex saamaanya maaloom detaa haih apane saathiyon ke saath sex kar chuke 33 fisadi mardon main se 57 fisadi kaa rishta maatahaton ke saath tha
 Of the 22 per cent of women who had sex in a sexual relationship, 61 per cent were associated with the boss
 kam se kam yahi vah sandesh he jo kaarysthal par india today-emdiare sex survey se saamne aata he
 It is not a spur of change that India Today has been surveying workplaces for the last 16 years in a survey of sexual behavior of modern Indians, which has been carried out extensively and representing the whole country
 is tarah kaa pehla sawaal 2003 main poocha gaya tha, yani us pehle hi saal jab yah survey shuru kiya gaya tha, ''kya aap tankhwaah main badhotaree yaa pramotion ke evaj main yon anugrah karnaa chahenge?"jawaab anumaan ke mutabik hi tha—mahaj 3 fisadi auraton ne kaha tha, 'haa'
 But what was not predictable was that when the same question was asked to single women again in 2005, the idea of swapping sexual favors to climb the ladder of success made them more acceptable — 17 percent of women said , 'yes', in exchange for great success in career, she will turn to sexual favors
 26-30 saal ke aayu varg kii auraten 18-25 kii umr ke daayre main aane vaali apni samakakshon kii bajaae is vichaar ke prati zyada khuli thim
 They were asked, "have any men ever asked you for sexual favors in exchange for a job, responsibility or promotion?" About 10 percent of the women said, "yes"

 The rules of the workplace were clearly changing

 Nanda Mazumdar, who is heading Intellectual Capital and Professional Development in Mumbai, an international law firm, Nishith Desai Associates, says, "women entering new professions, pre-marriage sex and increased acceptance to become unmarried mothers, all together at work Are bringing radical changes in man-woman relationship
 "technology main aae oochaal se gajet or camaron kii badaulat ham jab chahen antarang ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, what is shameful and what is not, who needs to be kept hidden and about whom to talk openly, who should be punished, who should not be given, it has become unacceptable to examine these things and to get rid of them
 kanoon bana prismmgar jitna hi zyada ham khulte jate hai, utana hi zyada hamaara saamana apane yon mulyon or kaamuk aacharnon ko lekar hone vaale takaraavon se hota he
 They bear tremendous symbolic weight, especially at workplaces, as the law is now a new prism, which disciplines and punishes those who deviate from the rules

 Team India captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni is happy with the victory against the Australian team in Nagpur, but his concern has also increased with this
 is chintaa kii vajah he itane bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue zyaadaatar ran boundry se bananaa
 If Dhoni believes, it is not right for cricket in the long run
 viraat kohli ne 66 gendon par 18 chaukon kii madad se 115 ran banaae the, jabaki shikhar dhawan ne 100 ranon kii pari main 11 chauke jad daale the
 At the same time, Rohit Sharma had scored 79 runs and during this time 7 fours came off his bat
 isse pehle team india ne jaipur main duusare vanade main 360 ranon ke lakshya ko 44wein over main hi hasil kar liya tha
 '7 hours got to see just fours and sixes' Dhoni said after the match,' More runs are being made against bowlers after the change in rules
 ek atirikt khilaadi andar hota he, jisase ballebaajon ke liye ran bananaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 It seems that 350 runs are like 280, 290 or 300 runs before
 tej gendbaaj bhi third main or fine leg ko andar rakhkar gendbaaji karne lage hai
 'he said,' i don't know which way the game is going
 isse manoranjan ho rahaa he lekin agar ham is tarah lakshya ko hasil karte rahe to lambey samay main yah khel kii sehat ke liye acha nahin hoga
 We got only fours and sixes in seven hours today
 ’'viraat, shikhar or rohit teenon ko jeet kaa shrey'lakshya kaa peechha karte hue ranneeti ke bare main poochne par dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamane 30 over ke antaraal ko pehle liya or iske liye ranneeti banaai
 We planned that if we make around 180 runs in the first 30 overs, then we can make the remaining runs in the subsequent 20 overs, because it will also have the power play overs
 ’ dhoni ne is jeet kaa shrey kohli ke alaava dhawan or rohit sharma (79) kii salaami jodi ko bhi diya jinhone pehle wicket ke liye 178 ran kii record saajhedaari karke bharat ko shandaar shuruyaat dilaai
 "virat lifted the pressure on the rest of the batsmen", the Indian captain said, "I think Shikhar and Rohit batted brilliantly
" shikhar ne shatak banaaya lekin rohit ko pareshaani ho rahi thi or vah gap nahin dhund paa rahaa tha lekin vah dabaav ko jhelane main safal rahaa or usne acchhee pari kheli

 "bengaluru will also be rained for runs" The seventh and decisive match of the series will be played on November 2 at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru and Dhoni said once again a big score can be expected
 unhone kaha, ‘bengalooru ko bade score vaale maichon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 There are around 180 runs in T20 matches, so do not know how many runs will be sufficient to score or score goals there

 'shikhar or rohit ne kam kar diya tha dabaav'main of da match kohli ne kaha ki rohit or shikhar ne acchhee shuruyaat dekar dabaav kaaphi kam kar diya tha
 Kohli said, 'I think that was our strategy

 The posterior muscles were stretched later and it was important that one of the two of us stayed to the end
 maine shuruyaat main kuch jokhim uthaae or safal rahaa

 On this, if the front asks where there has been a mistake in his tax calculation? So he has to bully him by saying that i am from the Investigation Department, not the Audit Department, to help him point out the mistake

 According to Thane Police Commissioner, only 7 call centers are under their scrutiny
 lekin mumbai or aasapaas ke duusare kuch kollcentaron se bhi ye gorakhdhandha chalane se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This is the reason why the call centers which have been left out of the eyes of the police have also come on the radar of the police
 khaskar ke thane gramin ke jahaan ke 7 kol centaron se vyapaar ke naam par america main jabaran vasuuli chal rahi thi
 The police has now been involved in making a list of all the call centers in their areas and examining their documents

 According to Thane Police Commissioner Parambir Singh, the caller used to threaten his victim that if he does not settle soon, the US police can arrest him as soon as the phone line is cut
 parambir singh ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki jo bhi kol karata tha wo chaahe nayaa ho yaa purana, script se saaf he ki use farjivade kii jaankaree hoti thi
 That is why the police has arrested only 70 people but accused 630 people who were currently undergoing training, who were peons, have been released

 com / 7cfedj8brf Soon after President Barack Obama's successful visit to India, the BJP has focused its attention on the Delhi Assembly elections
 aam aadmi party ko satta ke galiyare se maharoom rakhane ke liye party netabadtod raily or aakraamak tevaraki nai niti banaai he
 The BJP has decided that under this, she will ask AAP five questions every day
 guuruuvaar ko iske tahat party ne arvind kejariwal or unki party ko jhooth kaa sahaara lene vaali party bataaya or paanch sawaal puche
 BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said that we believe that Kejriwal has prepared his campaign with false promises and misleading propaganda
 aise main jaruri he ki dilli ke logon tak sahi or sach baat pahunche
 Among the five questions that the BJP asked the Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal, the main charge is the 'u-turn' government
 bijepi ne kejariwal se poocha-1)kejariwal ne dilli main apane siddhanton ke khilaaf jaakar sarkaar kyon banaai
 Why did he seek the support of Congress to form the government? 2) Despite the promise, why did Kejriwal's government not take action against former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit? Why was not an FIR made against him? 3) Why did Kejriwal take protection despite his declaration? He was given z grade protection by the UP government
 4) chunaav se pehle kejariwal ne kaha ki vah apni car se safar karenge, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad unhone SUV kii suvidha kyon lee?5) kejariwal ne privet jet se or hawaii yatra ke dauraan bijness class se safar kyon kiya?khoda pahaad, nikali chuhia
 
 
 Reacting to the bjp's allegations, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav said, "khoda Pahar, Nikli Chuhiya and that too died
 lekin jab aise sawaal puche jate hai to yah samaj janaa chahie ki bijepi ghabaraai hui he
 Come or not on the stage, as many questions, as many answers
 kiran or arvind kar len sawaal-jawaab
 Yadav said that when we made an open offer, the BJP ran away from the debate
 yahaan tak ki bijepi menifesto bhi jari nahin kar rahi he
 Significantly, making the election campaign aggressive, the BJP is going to hold 250 rallies in Delhi in seven days, which is an average of 36 rallies daily
 itnaa hi nahin, arvind kejariwal se rojaanaa 5 sawaal bhi puche jaaenge

 ''sibiai ke nideshak alok verma ko jabaran chuttee par bhej diya gaya he or uski jaanch ab sevanivrutt nyaayadhish ke marfat kii jaaegi
 Because of the direct intervention by the Modi government-nominated Special Director Rakesh Asthana in the name of the Prime Minister's Office, Verma vs Asthana was released in the CBI
 ''ek-duusare ke logon ko giraftaar karne se lekar karyaalay par chapa maarane kaa tamaasha hua, jiske chalate rashtriya suraksha or prashasan kii dhajjiyaan ud garin
 The 'CBI' is always the doll in the hands of the government, it has always been said, but such an attempt was made to keep personal ownership directly on that doll
 'jaanboojhkar sibiai vivadasibiai main jari jhagade ko suniyojit yojana bataate hue saamana aage likhata he, 'sibiimen number ek or do kaa vivaad jaan-boojhkar paidaa kiya gaya he
 Asthana used to interrupt his work when Verma was a director
 iske peeche nishchit hi kisi kii preranadai shakti ho sakati he
 Rahul Gandhi has linked the subject of the CBI dispute to the Rafale case
 alok verma rafel maamle kii jaanch karnaa chaahate the or is sandarbh main unhone kuch mahatvapurn jaankaree praapt kii thi
 "to make it not go further, Varma was attacked through Asthana," says Rahul Gandhi
 asthana gujarat cader ke adhikari hai or ve modi-shah ke atyant vishwasaneey hai
 There is nothing like raising objections in this context, but their objectivity is feared and they are known as BJP 'sharp shooter'
 ''sibiai' par ab tak aarope lage lekin aaj jis tarah kaa keechad us par uchhal rahaa he, aisa pehle kabhi nahin hua
 It seems that the CBI is a dog tied in the house of the BJP government
 us kute ke pet main aaj koi bhi laat maar rahaa he, yah tasviir acchhee nahin
 The creation scam and Rakesh Asthanasamana further write that Nitish Kumar was saved by Rakesh Asthana from Bihar's infamous creation scandal and due to the same pressure, Nitish Kumar was forced to leave Lalu and he was pushed into the tent of BJP, it is now publicly It is being said
 yah srijan ghotaalaa dhai hajaar karod kaa tha or nitish kumaar par tab aarope lage the
 'this was the only Asthana to arrest Lalu Yadav in the fodder scam
 2002 main gujarat ke godhra main hue sabarmati express agnikand maamle kii jaanch yantranaa ke pramukh ke rup main mukhyamantri modi ne inhen kii niyukti kii thi
 Asthana also investigated and took action in the Asaram Bapu case
 ''matlab bijepi netaaon ko jaisaa chahie, vaisaa ve karte gaye or modi ne unhen sibiai kaa vishesh nideshak niyukt kar usee seva kaa puraskaar diya
 The plight of the CBI today is due to this political interference and infiltration
 'dhwast kii ja rahi raaj vyavastha'raaj vyavastha kaa ek-ek khambha is tarah dhwast kiya ja rahaa he
 Rashtrapati Bhavan has already been stunned
 cabinet kaa bhi vaise koi matlab nahin rah gaya he
 There are Home Ministers, but institutions like CBI are being controlled by the Prime Minister's Office
 ''adaalat kaa dimag pehle hi asthir kar diya gaya he or sansad ko bhi bahut mahatv nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Today, the 'chopstick' Kadi of the major pillars of the country has not survived as much
 modi japan main chopstick se vaise khaaen, yah sikh rahe hai
 Here only four major pillars of the Hindusthani Raj system have now become 'kadi'

 ab tak ke rujhaanon or parinaamon se lagata he ki vah duusare number par rahegi or satta kii ichha rakhane vaali kisi bhi party ko usase bargen karnaa hi padegaa
 The party opened a front against the BJP after it failed to align with the BJP in the Maharashtra Assembly elections
 us samay uddhav thakare ko lagane laga ki bijepi ke kaaran hi unke sir se mukhyamantri pad kaa taj chhinata ja rahaa he or isliye ve aakraamak hote chale gaye
 He also spared PM Modi in his publicity speeches and attacked him too
 haalanki yah shuru se hi spasht tha ki shivasena akele apane dam par chunaav nahin jeet sakati, lekin uddhav thakare or unke bete aditya ne koi kasar nahin chodi
 When exit polls started coming after the election, the Shiv Sena first made it clear that it would not have any connection with the BJP, but as time passed, its bid began to change
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki ensipi ke bhi swar badal rahe the or uske bade netaaon ne saaf kar diya ki raajnneeti main koi sthaayee dushman nahin hota
 This put pressure on the Shiv Sena and today it gave signs of reconciliation
 duusari ore, jaankaron kaa kahana he ki shivasena is baar bijepi se jabardast bargening karegi or apni kadi sharten manavaaegi
 It may be that he has also shrugged his nose and eye in the name of bjp's CM candidate

 Shiv Sena can also pressurize for good ministries
 uddhav thakare is samay aahat mahasoos kar rahe hai or vah apni bhadaas bijepi par nikaal sakate hai
 Shiv Sena will also ask for more share in the center
 vaise bhi party ke cote se abhi puure mantri nahin bane hai
 The party can claim many important ministries at the center, as it currently holds the key to power
 puure parinaam aane ke baad tasviir saamne aegi, lekin yah tay he ki shivasena satta kii icchhuk party ko khun ke aansu rulaaegi
 She will ask for her entire share including interest

 i think the Congress party has a lot to offer to the people of Uttar Pradesh, so we will try as much as possible for the Congress party

 If the chauri-chaura incident did not happen in February 1922, then Bardoli of Gujarat would probably have been known to have started civil disobedience
 lekin niyati ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 In 1926, the revenue from farmers in Bardoli taluka was increased by 30% several times
 yah anyaay tha
 The peasants decided to oppose this and not to pay the increased goods prices
 lekin sarkari tantra ko nicha dikhaanaa asambhav nahin hota lekin usase takaraana mushkil jarur hota he
 The farmers of Bardoli were looking for a leader who would make the scared farmers realize their strength, which would also kill the dead
 barrister ballab bhai (patel) us samay tak gujarat main gandhi ke baad number do ke netaa tha
 The peasants invited him to come to Bardoli and take the lead
 ve turant bardoli aae lekin netritv karne se pehle puure maamle ko acchhee tarah samajha or gandhi ji ko samajhaayaa
 He gave leadership to this agitation against the increased Malgujari but with a week's time
 
 
 yah samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha, yah soch-vichaar karne ke liye ki ahimsak andolan karne ke dauraan kya-kya sahanaa pad saktaa he,sarkaar kya-kya julm kar sakati he
 In this battle, i have not just jumped to save you a little money
 main to bardoli ke kisaanon kii ladaai dwaara gujarat ke saare kisaanon ko paath sikhaanaa chahta hum
 i want to teach them that the British government's state runs only because of their weakness
 aap hi dekhiye ki ek ore to sarkaar praja ke haath main mulki shashan saunpane kii baat karti he or duusari ore yaha kisaanon kii jaminen khalsa karne kii chaal chal rahi he
 These are blank threats
 jise sarkari naukari kerani he, vah in dhamkiyonse dar saktaa he
 The farmer's son has no reason to fear him
 use to vishwaas hona chaiye ki yah jameen hamaare baapadadi kii thi or hamaari hi rahegi
 Writer Raoji Bhai, who wrote a book on Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, has written that the sharpness in the voice of Ballabh Bhai and the fire that appeared in his eyes was the first time
 kisaan ballab bhai ke peeche chal pade
 During this time Gandhiji also came to Bardoli
 logon ne unase bhaashan dene kii guzarish kii lekin unhone aisa na karte hue kaha; "bardoli ke sardaar kii ajna he ki koi bhaashan na de
 i cannot violate the order of the Sardar
 "kuch jagahon par miltaa he ki ye bardoli kii mahilaayein thim, jinhone ballab bhai ko 'sardaar' kii oopaadhi di thi or ise hi gandhi ji doharaa rahe the
 The people of Bardoli, as if, began to experience a divine power
 puraa bardoli ekajute ho gaya
 This entire movement was non-violent
 puure ilaake main malgujari dene se inkaar kar diya gaya
 There was a social boycott of officers / employees residing in the area
 ab sarkaar samjhaute ke liye tanik udaar hui lekin khabaren aane lagi ki rajasav vruddhi 30 se se ghataakar 21-22% kii jaae
 Some peasants and tenants also came loose
 lekin sardaar nahin dige
 It was a glimpse of the 'iron-man'
 unhone sandesh diya; "samay se pehle aam kaa fal todenge to vah khatta hoga
 But if you let it cook, it will break automatically
 "baatcheet-baithkon ke daur ke gandhi ji kaa sandesh aayaa; "hamane jis purush ko apana sardaar banaaya, uski ajna kaa hamen aksharshah paalan karnaa chahie
 It is our religion to do so
 yah baat sach he ki main sardaar kaa bada bhai hoon lekin saarvajanik jivan main ham jiske adheen kaam karen, vah hamaara putr ho yaa chota bhai ho, to bhi hamen uski ajna kaa paalan karnaa hi chahie
 This is not a new rule
 yah to hamaara pracheen dharm he
 To follow this religion, Shri Krishna became the charioteer of Arjuna and raised the juthi plates in the Rajasuya Yajna of Yudhishthira Raja
 isliye aaj to main aapako keval dhanyavad hi detaa hoon
 Vallabh bhai has spread your fame all over the country
 sarkaar ne aapako saare jagat main prasiddh kar diya he
 You will get even greater victory in future
 "jaisaa gandhi ji ne likhaa ki prasiddhi jagat main fail gai he to tatkaaleen vysarai irvin bhi pareshaan hue or unhone tatkaal maamle ko rafa-dfa karne ke liye maxwell-broomfield kamishan kaa gathan kiya
 This commission found the increase to be too much and reduced it to just 6%

 At some point in everyone's life, the question arises whether physical relations are necessary for married life
 How do intimate relationships affect marriage? Does the success and failure of a relationship depend only on it? Will the relationship end without it? Everyone has their own thinking about the physical relationship
 mul rup se ye pyaar jataane kaa ek tarika he
 When two people are fully confident about each other and trust is established between them, only then they are able to move on to a physical relationship
 hamaare samaaj main shaadi ke baad hishareerik sambandhon ko jaij mana jaataa helekin liv-in relationships ne is soch ko kaaphi had tak prabhavit kiya he
 But in such a situation it is very important to know how much physical relationship matters for the success of a relationship: 1
 pyaar jataane kaa jariyakisi bhi rishte ke liye shaareerik sambandh yaa finnntarang sambandh behad mahatvapurn hote hai kyonki ye pyaar jataane kaa bahut kargar tarika he
 It has often been seen that in relationships where there is a lack of sex, it breaks very quickly or there is a rift between the couples
 2
 How to show interest: Sexual life also shows how unstructured between partners
 ve ek-duusare main kitni ruchi rakhte hai or ek-duusare ke liye kya sochate hai
 The sex life of any couple is a symbol of trust between them
 3
 In many research to relieve stress and resolve conflicts, it has been proved that sex reduces stress
 aise main shaareerik sambandh tanaav kam karne ke saath hi chote-mote jhagadon ko sulajhane main bhi madadgaar hota he
 4
 asuraksha kii bhaavana kam karne ke liesexual life se parteners ke bich bharosa badhata he or unamem ek-duusare ko lekar agar koi asuraksha kii bhaavana he to vah bhi dur ho jaati he
 5
 swasthya ke liye phydemandakai shodh yah sabit kar chuke hai ki healdi life ke liye sex kaaphi kargar hota he
 The hormones that are produced after sex increase the body's resistance
 is dauraan ek minute main kareeb paanch calories kharch hoti hai, jisase yah kaaphi had tak eksrasij karne jaisaa phayda detaa he

 The BJP has recommended the death penalty for convicts of gang rape, rape after kidnapping and hostage rape, in the suggestions given by the party to the Justice Verma Committee to enact stricter laws against crimes like rape
 bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne nyaayamurti (sevanivrutt) je es verma ko apane suzav bheje hai

 Yuvraj Singh, who was out of the Test team due to poor form and fitness, on Monday insisted that he was in a good rhythm during the tour of Sri Lanka and the decision of the selectors is disappointing for him
 yuvaraj ne srilanka main abhyaas match main 118 jabaki gaale main pehle test kii pehali pari main 52 ran kii pari kheli thi or unka maananaa he ki srilanka main khele do maichon main ek shatak or ardhashatak unhen austrailia ke khilaaf do maichon kii shrinkhalaa main jagah dilaane ke liye kaaphi hona chahie tha
 He told reporters, 'the selection is not in my hands
 srilanka main maine do match khele, pehle main maine shatak or duusare main ardhashatak banaaya
 If this is not enough, i cannot say anything
 ’ yuvaraj ne kaha, ‘beshak yah niraashajanak he lekin niraashaa mere jeet kaa hissaa ban chuki he
 In the last two years, i was very hurt and had to struggle
 yah mere haath main nahin he
 Yuvraj missed the second Test against Sri Lanka due to illness and Suresh Raina scored a century in his place
 fitness ke bare main poochne par punjab ke is ballebaaj ne kaha, ‘yah ab kaaphi behatar he
 Sri Lanka tour was very difficult for me due to dengue and neck injury
 agle kuch dinon main main or feet ho jaaunga
 Asked why he is struggling in the longer format of the game, Yuvraj said that he himself cannot know where the shortcomings lie
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley saat saal se main test team main apni jagah pakki karne kii koshish kar rahaa hum lekin aisa nahin kar paaya
 It is quite disappointing
 iske kai kaaran ho sakate he
 i don't even know the first reason
 iske baad main chotil or biimaar ho gaya
 ' rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne ek baar phir aarakshan kaa raag ched diya he
 Considering the previous dispute, this time the Sangh has supported the reservation on economic basis instead of reviewing the reservation
 haryana main jat aarakshan andolan ke sandarbh main ravivaar ko sangh ne poocha ki sampann logon ko aarakshan kyon? vahiin mandiron main mahilaon ke jane par roak ko sangh ne galat tehraaya
 Advocating caste-based discrimination, social harmony, Sarkaryavah Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi of the Sangh said that members of the Hindu community are responsible for caste-based discrimination and we have to end it for social justice
 unhone is babat babasahab bhimrao ambedkar ko yaad kiya
 He rejected the demand for reservation by influential sections
 aarakshan kaa laabh paane waalon par ho researchbhaiyaji joshi ne yah pataa lagane ke liye adhyayan karne kii vakaalat kii ki pichde varg ke jaruratmand logon ko aarakshan kaa laabh mil rahaa he yaa nahin
 Rejecting the demand of reservation for the affluent, he said that Ambedkar had made provisions for reservation for social justice
 maujuuda daur menaarakshan kii mangakar rahe logon ko is avadharana ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 The weaker sections are in great need of help, he said, 'it seems that this thinking is not in the right direction
 aise (sampann) varg ke logon ko apane adhikaar chhod dene chahie or samaaj ke kamjor tabake kii madad kerani chahie, lekin iske bajaay ve apane liye aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 This thinking is not in the right direction
 ’ is tarah kii maangon ke liye unhone kisi varg kaa sidhaa naam nahin liya
 It is believed that his reference was towards the Jat community, which had recently started a violent movement in Haryana for reservation
 mahilaon ke pravesh par mandir prabandhan kare pahaldusri ore sangh ne ravivaar ko kaha ki kisi mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par roak anuchit he
 Bhaiyaji Joshi said that the temple arrangements that put such prohibition should change their thinking
 yah bayaan pichley dinon maharashtra ke do mandiron main mahilaon ke pravesh ke liye chalaae gaye andolan kii khabaron ke bich aayaa he
 Resolve sensitive issues through dialogue, not agitation, he said, "there is no consensus on the question of entering the temple in some places due to some inappropriate traditions
 aise samvedansheel vishyon ko baatcheet or samvaad se suljhaayaa janaa chahie, andolanon se nahin
 'he said,' Women go to thousands of temples in the country, but where there is talk of their entry into some temples, it is necessary to change the thinking
 aise mandiron ke prabandhanon ko bhi yah samajhnaa chahie
 'sarkaryavah of the Sangh said,' Women are learning Vedas and also doing religious work
 ’paryaavaran ke mudde se upar nahin hai shrisridilli main shri shri ravishankar ke saanskrithik mahotsav par uthe vivaad ke bich joshi ne kaha ki agar paryaavaran kaa koi mudda he to sabhi ko niyamon kaa paalan karnaa chahie, chaahe koi vyakti ho yaa sanghathan
 At the same time, he also said that if fines are kept, then the efforts to get revenge in the society will be weak
 noida police ne online frod karne vaale africa mul ke naagarik ko giraftaar kiya he
 The accused used to cheat the companies of India
 aaropee mul rup se south africa kaa rahane vaala hai, jo mumbai se giraftaar hua he
 a case of cheating of Rs 60 lakh was recently registered against him
 police aaropee se poochtacha kar rahi he
 According to the information, Rajkumar Anand, resident of Noida Sector 134, informed the police station that he exports the company's goods to 10 countries
 china se aayaat karte hai
 It was in this context that he started the business from the South African company Hyca Group Trade Limited, which is owned by Steven Diamond
 vaadi ne mung or arhar kii daal kaa order diya
 For this, he transferred his account to FNB Jahans Work South Africa online as advance 86500 USD i

 On the basis of the document, he went to receive his goods at the Mumbai port, then told that all these documents are fake

 He was constantly chatting
 iske baad aaropee ne asal dastavej ke naam par aath lakh rupee or dene kaa dabaab banaaya
 After this, the plaintiff informed the police station

 After talking about doing business with them at a good level in India, the matter in both of them moved forward
 soshal media par bihar shiksha board kaa ek paper viral ho rahaa he, jisamen bharat ke abhinn ang kashmir ko alag desh bataaya gaya he
 This paper was prepared for the students of class seven, in which Kashmir was described as a separate country
 media reports ke mutabik yah paper 5 oktober kii pariksha kaa he or yah pariksha bihar board kii wing bihar ajukeshan project council kii ore se yojit kii gai thi
 Actually in this paper of class 7th, some countries were named and asked what the citizens of those countries are called
 isamen china, nepal, england or bharat ke saath kashmir kaa naam bhi shaamil tha
 This paper made by Biharboard clearly shows that the board is considering Kashmir as a separate country
 is paper ke viral hone ke baad board is galati ko lekar pallaa jhaad rahe hai
 According to an English newspaper, Vaishali education officer Sangeeta Sinha says that she was on holidays and will now investigate the matter
 bihar bordake is ravaiye ke baad log soshal media par iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Board officials, however, consider it to be their fault
 of political turmoil of Karnataka assembly elections 
 is survey ke mutabik karnataka kii siyaasi jang main congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla hota dikh rahaa he
 However, BJP is struggling to return to power again with the help of BS Yeddyurappa
 vahiin congress apni satta ko bachaane ke siddharmaiya ke chehre ke sahare maidan main he
 According to the India Today Group and Karvy Insights Opinion Poll Survey, neither party seems to be getting majority
 congress kii siton pichley vidhansabha chunaav kii tulana main ghat rahi he
 Whereas BJP seats seem to be increasing tremendously
 congress ko 22 se 30 siton kaa nuksansurve ke mutabik karnataka ke 2018 vidhansabha chunaav main congress sabase badi party banakar ubharegi, par bahumat se dur rahegi
 The Congress is seen getting between 90 and 101 out of the total 224 seats in the state
 jabaki congress ko 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 122 siten mili thi
 In this way, the Congress is losing 22 to 30 seats in the 2018 elections as compared to the 2013 assembly elections
 bijepi ko siton kaa ijafasrvey ke mutabik bijepi kii siton main ijapha hota dikh rahaa he
 BJP sees 78 to 86 seats

 In this sense, BJP is seen to increase from 28 to 35 seats as compared to the last election
 jedies puraane aakade ke ird-girdakarnataka kii siyasat main teesraa takat janata dal (es) apane puraane aakade par simatati hue dikh rahi he
 The 2018 assembly election JD (S) seems to get 34 to 43 seats
 jabaki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main use 40 siten mili thi
 At the same time, others seem to get 4 to 7 seats this time
 jabaki 2013 ke chunaav main 12 siten mili thi
 According to the survey by Karvy Insights, the Congress is looking to repeat its old figure
 congress ko 37 fisadi vot miltaa dikh rahaa he
 In the 2013 elections too, the Congress got only 37 percent votes
 bijepi ke seat badhane ke saath-saath vot share bhi badhata dikh rahaa he
 The BJP is seen to bring 35 per cent vote share
 jabaki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 33 fisadi vot mili the
 In this way, bjp's vote share seems to be increasing by two per cent
 jedies ko basapa se gathbandhan karne kaa phayda miltaa dikh nahin rahaa he
 The JDS seems to get 19 percent of the vote
 jabaki 2013 jedies 20 fisadi or basapa ko 1 fisadi vot mili the
 In this way, the two parties together get 21 percent of the vote
 maujuuda vot share se denkhe to 2 fisadi vot kam hota dikh rahaa he
 Others are getting 9 percent votes
 2013 main bhi yahi akda he

 Once again, Indian cricketer Virat Kohli has spoken openly about his relationship with his actress girlfriend Anushka
 haal hi main ek akhbaar ko die gaye intervyuu main viraat ne kaha ki anoushka ke khilaaf kahi gai baaten unhenchotapahunchaati hai
 Talking about the incident where people blamed Anushka for the Indian team's defeat in the 'world Cup', Virat said that our relationship has become stronger after this incident
 viraat ne yah bhi kabuula ki vah kai baar gusse main apana aapa kho baithte hai
 He said, 'yes, i have crossed my boundaries in anger many times but i am not allowed to target Anushka for anything
 agar koi meri garlfriend ko kuch bura bhala kahegaa to jaahir si baat he ki mujhe gussa aayega kyonki vah mere liye behad personal he
 If someone says something to your partner, you cannot sit quietly like this
 log mere vyavhaar ke bare main baat karte hai, main ise sweekaarta hum ki haa, kai baar maine gusse main apni seemaa langhi he
 'I can even die for Anushka
 When Virat was asked that you take care of Anushka very much, she said,' i will give my life for whomever i want
 jo bhi mere kareeb hai main unka khyal rakhata hum
 i still feel sad that Anushka's effigies and pictures were burnt to lose in the World Cup, this should not happen
 'iske alaava viraat se yah sawaal bhi poocha gaya ki kya aap donon ko kabhi insecurity nahin hoti kyonki anoushka mail ko-stars ke saath kaam karti hai or aapaki bhi femail friend foloving kaaphi he? jawaab main viraat ne kaha, 'nahin, bilkul nahin
 We understand each other and also understand each other's perspective
 ham ek duusare ke halaaton ko samajhate hai
 There is nothing like mistrust and dishonesty between us
 'shaadi kaa khyalviraat se jab yah poocha gaya ki unhen anoushka kii vah koun si cheez he jo atract karti he to unka jawaab tha ki yah bahut personal sawaal he agar vah ek cricketer naa hote to unase yah sawaal nahin poocha jaataa
 Apart from this, when asked about Virat's marriage, he said, 'let some things remain personal
 anoushka or main ek duusare kii bahut izzat karte hai
 'viratne proved like a good boyfriend that he can't even hear a word against his girlfriend Anushka
 viraat ne kaha ki vaounushkake saath behad khush hai or 'world cap' kii ghatana ke baad unka rishta or majboot ho gaya he
 Well, this style of this lover boy is also praise-worthy

 These include 21 mig-29 and 12 Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft
 samachar agency eenai ne sarkaar ke sutron ke hawaale se bataaya ki agle kuch saptaah main raksha mantralay kii ucchstareey baithak hone vaali he, jisamen bhartiya vayusena 33 ladaaku vimaan kharidne kaa prastaav pesh karne kii taiyaari main hai
 Recently, several fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force had crashed, due to which their number has also decreased
 lihaaja in nae ladaaku vimaanon ko vayusena ke bede main shaamil karke isaki kami ko dur kiya ja sakegaa
 With the induction of 12 Sukhoi aircraft, the Indian Air Force's fleet of Sukhoi fighter aircraft will increase to 272
 bhartiya vayusena ne 21 mig-29 ladaaku vimaanon ko rus se kharidne kii yojana bana rahi he
 Russia has proposed to provide new fighter aircraft to overcome the shortage of fighter jets of the Indian Air Force
 sutron ke mutabik jo nae ladaaku vimaan kharide jane kii yojana he, wo aadhunik takanic se las or apgraded honge
 The Indian Air Force fleet already includes the mig-29
 nae mig-29 ke radar or anya upkaran bhi aadhunik maanakon ke anuroop honge
 News agency NIA quoted sources as saying that the deal for these fighters is in advanced stage
 bhartiya vayusena jald se jald is saude ko antim rup dene kii koshish main juty he
 Indian Air Force pilots are extremely adept at flying the mig-29
 haalanki rus dwaara jin ladaaku vimaanon ko dene kii peshkash kii gai he, wo pehle se shaamil mig-29 se alag hai
 The Navy also flies the mig-29 'K', but its combat aircraft experience has not been very good
 land karne ke baad is ladaaku vimaan kii setting change ho jaati he
 The Indian Air Force has three squadrons of mig-29s, which are upgraded from time to time

 The gems and jewelery sector, which is struggling with demonetisation, GST and sluggish demand, had hoped to reduce customs duty on gold in the Union Budget 2019-20
 lekin kendriya bajet main sona or anya beshkeemtee dhaatuon par seemaa shulk 10 fisad se badhaakar 12
 Was reduced to 5 percent
 isse desh main sone kaa aayaat mahangaa ho jayega
 Economists are considering the move as rational with the imposition of curbs on imports of non-essential items, improving current account deficit and increasing revenue, but the industry is calling it a discourage to honest traders
 da bullian and juters association (tibijie) ke adhyaksh yogesh singhl kehete hai, ''seemaa shulk main badhotaree chori (grey market) ko badhaava degi
 The supply of illegal gold in the market will increase
 '' ek taraf 12
 After 5 per cent customs duty, 3 per cent GST and additional GST on some job work, there will be 18 per cent taxable ornaments and on the other hand, there is no buying in cash without a surety bill
 graahakon ko nakad or bill par milane vaale gahanon main paanch fisad tak kaa antar aa jayega
 This would allow honest traders to face inconsistent competition
 yani sarkaar kii niti hi unhen grey market kii ore le jane par majaboor karegi
 Industry is expecting a jump of 30 per cent in the gray market after the increase in customs duty
 iske alaava, yogesh desh main sone kii badi kharid karne vaale bade graahakon ke baahar jane kii bhi ashanka jataa rahe hai
 Such Indians, who often travel abroad, may move to the outside market to buy gold, which will be a double blow to the market facing shortage of demand
 vahiin, kedia camodity ke nideshak ajay kedia kehete hai, ''sarkaar ke is kadam se sone ke aayaat main giravat aati dikhegi, jisase chaalu khate par kaabo paane main madad milegi
 "in 2013, when the government raised the customs duty on gold to 10 per cent, the country used to import 1,000 tonnes of gold annually, but after the import is expensive, we have seen an average reduction of 250 tonnes annually
 kedia kehete hai, ''aayaat ghatane ke baad bazaar main sone kii aapurti kam na ho, iske liye sarkaar ko gold monetigeshan skim ko safal banane ke liye kade prayaas karne honge, jisase gharon or mandiron main rakhe sone ko bazaar main laakar gharelu vyapaariyon ke liye saste sone kii uplabdhta badhaai ja sake or sone kii kharid ke liye desh se baahar jane vaale dollar ko bhi roka ja sake
 According to an estimate, more than 28,000 tonnes of gold are kept in homes and temples, which was launched by the government in 2015 to bring out gold monetization scheme
 haalanki, abhi tak is skim ko apekshit pratikriya nahin mili or beete teen varshon main keval 15 ton sona hi jamaa hua he
 Says Ravi Singh, head (research), Karvy Stock Broking, "the decision to increase the customs duty on gold is certainly part of the government's policy of reducing imports of non-essential goods, but in the current scenario of the economy this step is on many fronts Will also be challenging

 Assam BJP president Siddharth Bhattacharya had a celebration with his former political rival and former state minister Hemant Biswa Sarma before Lutyens went to Amit Shah's house at 11 Akbar Road in Delhi
 in donon ne rajya ke zyaadaatar aam or khaas logon ko hairat main daal diya tha
 So much so that the BJP leadership was in the dark on the matter till the end of the meeting
 vahiin guwahati main tivi channelon ke “braking news” tikar par yah chal rahaa tha ki bhattacharya bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh se milakar tiwa swytt parishad ke chunaavon main party ke kharaab pradarshan kii vajah se apana istipha dene ja rahe hai
 Tiwa's results came a day earlier
 kahani thik ulat thi
 The mission of Bhattacharya, which has been going on for a year, was going to be peaceful after this meeting & BJP high command, once the right hand man of Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, inducted Sarma into the party despite opposition from six out of seven Lok Sabha mps of BJP in the state Was ready baithak ke agenda ko gopneey rakhaa gaya tha taaki ain maukey par kisi adnge se bachaa ja sake, khaas taur par kendriya mantri sarvanand sonoval kii ore se, jinhen sarama kaa party main pravesh mukhyamantri ke pad kii apni daavedaari ke liye khatra najar aa rahaa tha
 Sarma was also giving his full contribution in this game and he also tweeted on Congress' victory in Tiwa
 kabhi apane ustad rahe tarun gogoi se chaar saal tak chali jang main party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke gogoi kaa paksh lene ke faisle se naaraaz sarama ne pichley saal 21 july ko assam ke swasthya or shiksha mantri ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 Then why did the Sangh and BJP leadership agree to join Sarma by supporting Bhattacharya? The answer lies in Sarma's popularity in the state and his workmanship in election management
 2006 se 2014 ke bich swasthya mantri ke rup main jalukbaari se teen baar vidhayak rahe sarama ne kai lokapriy kadam uthaae, jinamein 24 ghante kii ambulance seva or gramin aspataalon main doctoron kii maujuudagi kii anivaaryta shaamil the
 Similarly, as Minister of Education from 2011 to 2014, he introduced a transparent process of recruitment of school teachers, which resulted in about two lakh new recruits
 guwahati sthit patrkaar or vishleshak dilip chandan kaa kahana he, “sarama ne us rajya main lakhon yuvaaon ko ummid dikhaai thi jahaan shikshakon kii naukariyaan khuleam bechi jaati thim
 This increased his popularity
 ” assam ke ek mantri kaa daawa he ki is badhati lokapriyata ne hi 2011 main raajnneeti main shaamil hone vaale gogoi ke bete gaurav ke man main asuraksha kii bhaavana paidaa kar di
 This 46-year-old leader, who came to politics through advocacy, has the highest number of followers on social media among the leaders of the Northeast
 ve vyaktigat rup se zyaadaatar tippaniyon or sandeshon kaa khud jawaab dete hai
 a Congress general secretary expressed disappointment that Sarma's departure from the party meant Assam's exit from the Congress for the next ten years
 unka kahana tha ki party ke paas rajya main is samay koi aisa netaa nahin he jo sarama se takkar le sake
 Rahul Gandhi, who vetoed his mother's decision to make Sarma chief minister in place of Gogoi last year, probably realized this mistake too late
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki 24 agast ko unhone sonia gandhi ke rajnatik sachiv ahamed patel ko yah sandeshaa bhijwaya tha, “meraa nijee number hemanth ko bhejkar unhen mujh se turant baat karne ko kahen
 "but Sarma decided not to end Rahul's wait
" haalanki bijepi main sarama kaa pravesh pichley maheene khatai main padataa najar aa rahaa tha
 Media reports said Sarma, the then Guwahati Development Minister, was one of the alleged bribes from US consultancy firm Louis Berger in 2010 for a water supply project in Guwahati
 assam ke kai bijepi saansadon kii khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa jab bijepi sansadeey dal ne jald hi ek parchaa jari kar diya jisamen kaha gaya ki sarama rishwat ke maamle main mukhya abhiyukt hai
 However, the former minister said that in his release of the US Department of Justice, it was said that the bribe was given not to the leaders but to the officials
 ab bhattacharya bhi isi tarah kaa bachaav pesh kar rahe hai
 "when we read the charge sheet and the court's decision filed before the relevant court in America, we found that there was no mention of Sarma in it
 ”2010 or 2014 main sarama ne rajyasabha chunaavon main congress ke ummidavaaron kii vijay sunishchit karne ke liye bijepi vidhayakon kii taraf se cross voting sunishchit kii thi
 BJP now wants to use their election management skills to their advantage
 unhone hi tamaam pratikultaaon or satta virdohi lahar ke baavjood assam or manipur main congress kii jeet sunishchit kii or phir 2013 main mizoram main party ko satta main lautaane vaale chunaavon kaa vittiya prabandhan bhi dekha
 The BJP also wanted to bring Sarma in any way due to its defeat in the Bodoland Territorial District (BTAD) elections earlier this year and then the Tiwa elections in August
 bijepi kaa aantarik survey kahata he ki aane vaale chunaavon main tasviir main naatakeey rup se koi badlaav nahin aayaa to bijepi 2016 main 50 se bhi kam siten hasil kar paaegi jo bahumat ke liye jaruri 63 siton se bahut kam he
 In such a situation he will need allies for the alliance and Sarma can be very useful in bargaining at that time
 unke teenon sambhavit gathbandhan saathiyon&bipief, eiudief or agypi se achche sambandh hai
 BJP is hoping that it can use Sarma's popularity and skills to form his first government in Assam, but the biggest question for his supporters is whether he will get what he could not find within Congress & Chief Minister in BJP Chair of? It will not be easy for Sarma in the new party because Sonowal too is eyeing that post
 in donon ke bich kii kadi pratispardhaa us samay kii he jab donon hi 1980 ke dashak main ol assam students union ke sadsy the
 One BJP leader says that Sonowal was the real mind behind the pamphlet that introduced Sarma as the main accused in the Louis Berger bribery scam
 ab yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki ek asmi film main bal abhinayta ke taur par shuruyaat karne vaale sarama kaise nai bhoomika main assam main camel khilaa pate hai

 He said, 'we have worked for the entire country irrespective of caste, creed and region
 ' Criticizing the Congress for not inviting the Prime Minister for Nehru's birthday program, he said that it does not harm Modi, but the Congress is at a disadvantage
 unhone kaha, 'congress ko janadesh, iskaa sandesh dekhnaa chahie or vishleshan karnaa chahie tathaa thik bartaav karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 ' maharashtra main devendra fadanvis nit bhaajapa sarkaar ko rakanpa dwaara samarthan kiye jane ke mudde par unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ne samarthan nahin maanga tha

 There are many interpretations of the courts regarding the confrontation between the governors and the chief ministers and also new limitations but whether this is happening in the case of Delhi
 kya dilli main is ladaai se sanvaidhanik dayitvon or adhikaron kii tasviir saaf hoti nazar aa rahi he
 After the latest controversy, for the first time on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia met the Lieutenant Governor
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is baithak main hai court ke aadesh par charchaa hui
 This order of the Delhi High Court also puts the Central Government's notification of May 21 in the dock, in which the Anti Corruption Bureau of Delhi will not take any cognizance of the crimes against the officers and employees of the Central Government or any member of the public
 isi ke aadhaar par rishwat ke aarope main giraftaar dilli police ke head consteble ne apni giraftaar ko chunauti di lekin adaalat ne zamaanat yachika khaarij kar di
 In July last year, the Central Government also issued a notification regarding the Anti Corruption Bureau
 justise vipin sanghee ne donon hi notification ko sandigdh bataate hue kaha ki yah karmchaaree dilli kii janata kii seva main hi laga hua he
 The work of Delhi Police is sufficient and essentially related to the state of Delhi, so in my view it comes under the jurisdiction of the Anti Corruption Bureau of the state government to investigate and arrest such people
 adaalat ne yah bhi mana ki aapraadhik kanoon or prakriya samavarti suchi main aate hai isliye dilli vidhansabha ko in maamle main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar bhi hasil he
 The Deputy Governor should act only on the basis of the help and opinion of the Council of Ministers
 raashtrapati up rajyapal ke zariye dilli par prashasan nahin kar sakate hai jinamein dilli kii vidhayika ko kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 The Delhi government did not challenge the notification of the Center in the court but the defeat of the head constable turned into a victory of the Chief Minister
 abhi saaf nahin he ki apane notification ke bachaav main centre sarkaar supreme court jaaegi yaa nahin
 This decision also creates a new interpretation of the relationship between Delhi Police and Delhi Government
 taatkaalik sawaal ye he ki kya centre kaa notification radd ho gaya he
 Was then excited by the High Court's decision that Chief Minister Kejriwal transferred 15 officers on Tuesday
 inamen se 9 iees afasar bhi shaamil hai
 This order is signed by Rajendra Kumar of Principal Secretary Services, Lieutenant Governor canceled the appointment of Rajendra Kumar and posted Anindo Majumdar but according to this order, Anindo Majumdar is not Principal Secretary
 is baar up rajyapal ne bhi apane adhikaar jataane ke liye mukhyamantri ke aadesh ko nirast nahin kiya he
 According to the central government, Anindo Majumdar could not take charge even after the copy of the order of the Deputy Governor of Delhi Super Boss
 centre sarkaar ke notification main kaha gaya ki up rajyapal zamin, kanoon vyavastha or police ke baad sevaaon ke maamle main bhi dilli kaa bos hai lekin mukhyamantri kejariwal ade hue hai ki dilli kaa bos to chunaa hua pratinidhi hi he
 Hence the Delhi government has called an emergency session of the two-day assembly
 vidhayak somnath bharti ne privet member prastaav pesh kiya ki centre ke notification ko ansaivadhinak ghoshit kiya jaae
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that it is right to make laws on all subjects except police, public order and land matters
 lekin centre sarkaar ne sevaaon ko bhi isamen jodakar dilli vidhansabha ke adhikaar kshetra kaa atikaraman kiya he
 There is no State Services in Delhi, there is no State Service Commission, so services will not come under the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 is daleel se to kal centre sarkaar yah bhi kah sakati he ki dilli main koyala khadaan nahin he to vah bijli ghar nahin laga sakati he
 The Deputy Governor was very much targeted in the assembly
 adarsh shastri ne mahabhiyog chalaane kii maang kii to vidhayak alka lamba ne aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar up rajyapal ke zariye moti kamai karti he to is baat ke virodh main bijepi ke vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne hangaamaa kar diya or apni aapatti jataai
 Both the BJP and the Congress have called the emergency session of the assembly as circus and spectacle respectively
 jab notification aayaa tha tab ek do din baad vitt mantri arun jetali ne uskaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki kanfuzan ko dur karne ke liye laayaa gaya he
 The elected government has enough rights to work
 mangalvaar ko patrakaron ne jab bijepi ke rashatreey adhyaksh amit shah se is bare main poocha to unka jawaab ye rahaa ki yah takaraav kaa maamla nahin he
 It is a matter of interpretation of the constitution
 yah maamla adaalat main jayega or vahiin sulajh jayega
 It seems that after the High Court order, the central government or BJP is no longer clear on the supremacy of the Deputy Governor as it was before
 aap jaanate hai ki is vishay ko lekar kanoon ke jaankaar bhi khub bahes kar rahe hai
 Most of the articles that are coming in the newspapers have mostly supported the right of the Chief Minister and the notification of the Center has been declared unconstitutional
 mangalvaar ke indian express main vivek ke tankhaa ne ol india sarvice act 1951 or rajyon kii paribhaasha ke sandarbh main ise dekhne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The All India Administrative Service Cadre Rule, 1954 should also be brought into this debate
 isamen samvidhan kii pratham anusuchee main paribhaati rajya main centre shasit pradesh ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 Accordingly, the state will distribute the cadre strength, number and work
 is maamle main rajya kii jagah rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli bhi padhaa ja saktaa he
 The comments civil servij kanoon main rajya kii paribhaasha main centre shasit pradesh ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 In this case, the Center wants to gain executive power in the case of states through notification
 samvidhan visheshgy subhash kashyap ne bijness standard main aditi fadanwis se kaha he ki paribhaasha ke hisaab se centre shasit pradesh centre se shasit hota he
 The President rules through the Deputy Governor
 dilli main jo mantriparishad he uskaa kaam sirf up rajyapal kii madad karnaa or salaah dena bhar he
 Delhi Legislative Assembly cannot make laws without the consent of the Deputy Governor
 kejariwal sarkaar ne is ladaai main vidhansabha ko bhi morcha bana diya he taaki ladaai ho hi rahi he to thik se ho lekin ek sadan ke bheetar up rajyapal par tohamatein lagaayee ja rahi hai, ise bhi vidhaayi paramparaon ke lihaaz se dekha janaa chahie
 It may be that this has also happened
 kya vidhansabha notification ko radd kar sakati he, kya hai court ke aadesh ke baad notification radd nahin ho gaya he? There are many interpretations of the courts regarding the confrontation between the governors and the chief ministers and also new limitations but whether this is happening in the case of Delhi
 kya dilli main is ladaai se sanvaidhanik dayitvon or adhikaron kii tasviir saaf hoti nazar aa rahi he
 After the latest controversy, for the first time on Tuesday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia met the Lieutenant Governor
 sutron kaa kahana he ki is baithak main hai court ke aadesh par charchaa hui
 This order of the Delhi High Court also puts the Central Government's notification of May 21 in the dock, in which the Anti Corruption Bureau of Delhi will not take any cognizance of the crimes against the officers and employees of the Central Government or any member of the public
 isi ke aadhaar par rishwat ke aarope main giraftaar dilli police ke head consteble ne apni giraftaar ko chunauti di lekin adaalat ne zamaanat yachika khaarij kar di
 In July last year, the Central Government also issued a notification regarding the Anti Corruption Bureau
 justise vipin sanghee ne donon hi notification ko sandigdh bataate hue kaha ki yah karmchaaree dilli kii janata kii seva main hi laga hua he
 The work of Delhi Police is sufficient and essentially related to the state of Delhi, so in my view it comes under the jurisdiction of the Anti Corruption Bureau of the state government to investigate and arrest such people
 adaalat ne yah bhi mana ki aapraadhik kanoon or prakriya samavarti suchi main aate hai isliye dilli vidhansabha ko in maamle main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar bhi hasil he
 The Deputy Governor should act only on the basis of the help and opinion of the Council of Ministers
 raashtrapati up rajyapal ke zariye dilli par prashasan nahin kar sakate hai jinamein dilli kii vidhayika ko kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 The Delhi government did not challenge the notification of the Center in the court but the defeat of the head constable turned into a victory of the Chief Minister
 abhi saaf nahin he ki apane notification ke bachaav main centre sarkaar supreme court jaaegi yaa nahin
 This decision also creates a new interpretation of the relationship between Delhi Police and Delhi Government
 taatkaalik sawaal ye he ki kya centre kaa notification radd ho gaya he
 Was then excited by the High Court's decision that Chief Minister Kejriwal transferred 15 officers on Tuesday
 inamen se 9 iees afasar bhi shaamil hai
 This order is signed by Rajendra Kumar of Principal Secretary Services, Lieutenant Governor canceled the appointment of Rajendra Kumar and posted Anindo Majumdar but according to this order, Anindo Majumdar is not Principal Secretary
 is baar up rajyapal ne bhi apane adhikaar jataane ke liye mukhyamantri ke aadesh ko nirast nahin kiya he
 According to the central government, Anindo Majumdar could not take charge even after the copy of the order of the Deputy Governor of Delhi Super Boss
 centre sarkaar ke notification main kaha gaya ki up rajyapal zamin, kanoon vyavastha or police ke baad sevaaon ke maamle main bhi dilli kaa bos hai lekin mukhyamantri kejariwal ade hue hai ki dilli kaa bos to chunaa hua pratinidhi hi he
 Hence the Delhi government has called an emergency session of the two-day assembly
 vidhayak somnath bharti ne privet member prastaav pesh kiya ki centre ke notification ko ansaivadhinak ghoshit kiya jaae
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that it is right to make laws on all subjects except police, public order and land matters
 lekin centre sarkaar ne sevaaon ko bhi isamen jodakar dilli vidhansabha ke adhikaar kshetra kaa atikaraman kiya he
 There is no State Services in Delhi, there is no State Service Commission, so services will not come under the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 is daleel se to kal centre sarkaar yah bhi kah sakati he ki dilli main koyala khadaan nahin he to vah bijli ghar nahin laga sakati he
 The Deputy Governor was very much targeted in the assembly
 adarsh shastri ne mahabhiyog chalaane kii maang kii to vidhayak alka lamba ne aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar up rajyapal ke zariye moti kamai karti he to is baat ke virodh main bijepi ke vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne hangaamaa kar diya or apni aapatti jataai
 Both the BJP and the Congress have called the emergency session of the assembly as circus and spectacle respectively

 The elected government has enough rights to work
 mangalvaar ko patrakaron ne jab bijepi ke rashatreey adhyaksh amit shah se is bare main poocha to unka jawaab ye rahaa ki yah takaraav kaa maamla nahin he

 It may be that this has also happened
 kya vidhansabha notification ko radd kar sakati he, kya hai court ke aadesh ke baad notification radd nahin ho gaya he? The immediate question is whether the notification of the Center has been canceled
 kya tabhi hai court ke faisle se utsahit hokar mukhyamantri kejariwal ne mangalvaar ko 15 adhikariyon ke tabadale kar diye
 Of these, 9 IAS officers are also involved
 is aadesh par principal secetry services ke rajendra kumaar ke hi dastakhat hai, uparajyapal ne rajendra kumaar kii tainaati ko radd kar anindo majumdaar ko tainaat kiya tha lekin is aadesh ke mutabik anindo majumdaar principal secetry nahin hai
 This time the Lieutenant Governor has also not canceled the Chief Minister's order to assert his authority
 centre sarkaar ke anusaar dilli ke super bos up rajyapal ke aadesh kii copy ke baad bhi anindo majumdaar charge nahin le sake hai
 The Central Government's notification said that the Lieutenant Governor is also the boss of Delhi in terms of land, law and order and post-police services, but Chief Minister Kejriwal is adamant that the boss of Delhi is the chosen representative
 isliye dilli sarkaar ne do dinon kaa vidhansabha kaa apatkaaleen satr bulaayaa he
 MLA Somnath Bharti moved a private member proposal to declare the Centre's notification as unethical
 up mukhyamantri manish sitaudiya ne kaha ki police, public order or zamin ke maamalon ko chhod sabhi vishyon par kanoon banane kaa adhikaar he
 But the Central Government has encroached the jurisdiction of Delhi Legislative Assembly by adding services to it
 dilli main state services nahin he, state sarvice kamishan nahin he isliye sevaayen dilli vidhansabha ke adheen nahin aaengi
 With this argument, tomorrow the central government can also say that if Delhi does not have a coal mine, it cannot set up a power house
 vidhansabha main up rajyapal ko khub nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 When Adarsh shastri demanded impeachment, MLA Alka Lamba alleged that the central government earns fat through the Deputy Governor, then BJP MLA Om Prakash Sharma created a ruckus and objected against it
 bijepi or congress donon ne vidhansabha ke apaat satr ko kramash: sarkas or tamaasha kaha he
 When the notification came, a couple of days later, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley defended it and said that the confusion has been brought to remove it
 chuni hui sarkaar ke paas kaam karne ke paryaapt adhikar hai
 When reporters asked BJP national president Amit Shah about this on Tuesday, their reply was that it is not a matter of confrontation
 samvidhan kii vyakhya kaa maamla he
 This matter will go to court and will be settled there
 aisa lagata he ki hai court ke aadesh ke baad centre sarkaar yaa bijepi ab up rajyapal kii sarvocchata ko lekar untii clear nahin he jitani pehle thi
 You know that even law experts are arguing a lot about this subject
 akhabaaron main jitne bhi lekh aa rahe hai zyaadaatar main mukhyamantri ke adhikaar kaa samarthan kiya gaya he or centre ke notification ko ansavaidhanik bataaya gaya he
 In Tuesday's Indian Express, Vivek K
 Tankha has tried to see this in the context of the All India Service Act 1951 and the definition of states
 All India Administrative Service Cadre Rule, 1954 ko bhi is bahes main laana chahie
 It also includes the Union Territory in the State defined in the First Schedule of the Constitution
 iske anusaar rajya cader kii kshantaa, sankhya or kaam kaa bantwaaraa karegaa
 In this case, National Capital Territory of Delhi can also be read instead of the state
 tippaniyan The Union Territory is also included in the definition of state in the Civil Services Act
 is maamle main kedra notification ke zariye rajyon ke maamle main kaaryakari shakti hasil karnaa chahta he
 Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap has told Aditi Fadnavis in the Business Standard that by definition, union territory is governed by the union
 raashtrapati up rajyapal ke zariye shashan karte hai
 The work of the Council of Ministers in Delhi is only to help and advise the Lieutenant Governor
 dilli vidhansabha up rajyapal kii sahmati ke bina kanoon nahin bana sakati he
 The Kejriwal government has also made the Legislative Assembly a front in this fight so that if the fight is going on properly, but the Lt
 Governor is being charged within a House, this should also be seen in terms of legislative traditions
 ho saktaa he ki yah bhi hota hi aayaa ho
 Can the Assembly cancel the notification, has the notification not been canceled after the High Court order? is baar up rajyapal ne bhi apane adhikaar jataane ke liye mukhyamantri ke aadesh ko nirast nahin kiya he
 According to the central government, Anindo Majumdar could not take charge even after the copy of the order of the Deputy Governor of Delhi Super Boss
 centre sarkaar ke notification main kaha gaya ki up rajyapal zamin, kanoon vyavastha or police ke baad sevaaon ke maamle main bhi dilli kaa bos hai lekin mukhyamantri kejariwal ade hue hai ki dilli kaa bos to chunaa hua pratinidhi hi he
 Hence the Delhi government has called an emergency session of the two-day assembly
 vidhayak somnath bharti ne privet member prastaav pesh kiya ki centre ke notification ko ansaivadhinak ghoshit kiya jaae
 Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that it is right to make laws on all subjects except police, public order and land matters
 lekin centre sarkaar ne sevaaon ko bhi isamen jodakar dilli vidhansabha ke adhikaar kshetra kaa atikaraman kiya he
 There is no State Services in Delhi, there is no State Service Commission, so services will not come under the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 is daleel se to kal centre sarkaar yah bhi kah sakati he ki dilli main koyala khadaan nahin he to vah bijli ghar nahin laga sakati he
 The Deputy Governor was very much targeted in the assembly
 adarsh shastri ne mahabhiyog chalaane kii maang kii to vidhayak alka lamba ne aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar up rajyapal ke zariye moti kamai karti he to is baat ke virodh main bijepi ke vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne hangaamaa kar diya or apni aapatti jataai
