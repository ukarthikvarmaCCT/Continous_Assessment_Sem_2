 satta main 30 din puure karne vaali apni sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par pradhanmantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko santosh prakat kiya, lekin saath hi mana ki kuch kshetron main ''sudhaar kii gunjaaish'' he
 He also complained that he did not get "honeymoon period" like previous governments and criticisms started within 100 hours
 unhone kaha ki unki pichhali sarkaron ko 100 din yaa usase bhi adhik kaa ''honeymoon period'' mila, lekin unki sarkaar ko satta sanbhale 100 ghante bhi nahin hue the ki aaropon ke silsile shuru ho gaye or aise ''vaakye'' bhi hue, jinase sarkaar kaa kuch lenaa-dena nahin tha, phir bhi vivaad bane rahe
 He, however, did not disclose these "allegations" and controversies
 modi ne kuch kshetron main sudhaar kii jarurat ko maanate hue kaha, ''nishchit taur par main mahasoos karata hum ki kai kshetron main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 He said that the big challenge for him in Delhi is to convince a select group of people that his intentions to bring positive change in the country are honest
 or aise log ''sarkaar kii vyavastha ke bheetar or baahar'' donon jagah hai
 In the article written in his blog on the occasion of completion of one month of his government, he complained that his criticisms were started immediately after the formation of the government
 unhone kaha, ''pichhali sarkaron ko 100 din yaa usase bhi adhik samay ke 'honeymoon period' kii chhot mili
 It is not unexpected that i did not get such an exemption
 100 din to bhul jaaie, aaropon kii bauchhaar 100 ghante se bhi kam samay main shuru ho gai
 '' unhone kaha, lekin jab koi sirf is uddeshy se kaam kar rahaa ho ki ji-jaan se desh kii seva kerani he to aisi baaten bemaani ho jaati hai
 That is why i am working and it is very satisfying
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 26 june ko unki sarkaar ke 30 din puure hue hai
 He said, "the date of June 26 is very important to me
 
 
 aaj hi ke din (1975 main) apatkaal shuru hua tha
 He said that emergency is definitely the darkest time in our history and reminds us of the horror of freedom of expression, freedom of press and silence of opposition
 modi ne kaha, ''agar ham bhaashan or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii guarantee nahin dete hai to hamaara loktantr jari nahin rah paaegaa
 Today is also the day to pledge to preserve our values and at the same time build such strong institutions through good governance so that we never have to see those dark days again
 '' In the context of some controversies that have arisen in the past, he said that there were disputes that had nothing to do with his government
 unhone kaha ki kisi par dosha nahin laga rahe hai, lekin unhen lagata he ki ek aisi vyavastha banani hogi jisamen sahi chijen sahi logon tak sahi vakt par panhuche
 The Prime Minister hoped that things would change
 chaar baar gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahe modi ne kaha, ek maheenaa pehle jab hamane sarkaar banaai thi to mujhe lagata tha ki main is jagah par nayaa hum or kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki kendra sarkaar ke kaary kii jatilta ko seekhney main mujhe kam se kam ek yaa do saal lagenge
 But fortunately after a month, such thoughts do not come to my mind anymore
 unhone kaha ki unka vishwaas kaaphi badha he
 He said that the credit for this confidence in him goes to the experience and wisdom of his cabinet colleagues and the experience of being chief minister himself four times
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki pichley 67 saal kii sarkaron kii tulana main unki sarkaar kaa ek maheenaa kuch bhi nahin he, lekin main yah kahana chaahunga ki is ek maheene main, hamaari puri team ne apana har pal janata ke kalyaan ke liye samarpit kiya
 Our decision was taken only keeping in mind the national interest
 modi ne kaha, ''sarkaar ke ek maheenaa puraa hone par main ek baar phir jabardast samarthan or sadbhaavna ke liye bharat kii janata ko salaam karata hum
 i assure you that we are committed to taking India to new heights in the coming days
 '' He said that the Chief Ministers of many states met him during this one month and he kept the issues related to his state with best wishes
 ''aane vaale dinon main main unke saath najdiki sahyog se kaary karne kii raah dekh rahaa hum

 The slogans and slogans made by BSP workers towards Singh's family are condemnable and indecisive

 The Narendra Modi government presented its last full budget and the most talked about in this budget was the ambitious 'ayushman Bharat' scheme, but there was another special thing in it which received relatively less discussion
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne apane bajet bhaashan main duniya kii sabase badi swasthya yojana 'ayushmaan bharat' kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki iske tahat kareeb 10 karod pariwaron ko salaana 5 lakh rupee kaa medical cover bhi diya jayega
 Also, 40% of the country's population i
e
 50 crore people will get the benefit of this scheme
 isamen nijee kshetra kii companiyaan bhi bhaag le sakengi
 Prodigal modicare! This Modi government's health plan is being treated as a 'obamacare' launched in the US in 2010
 'obamakare' kii tarah 'modicare' main bhi baari paisa lagegaa
 Sources reveal that according to the estimates of the Central Government, the cost of giving this insurance to a person in the country will come to about Rs 1100
 is tarah se 'modicare' main har saal 11 hajaar karod rupee kaa kharchaa aayega
 But now let's talk about the special thing which got less preference
 jetali ne bajet bhaashan ke dauraan kaha tha ki bharat ko swasth bharat banaaya jayega, iske liye deshbhar main 1
 5 lakh health centers will be opened
 in swasthya kendron ke khole jane kaa phayda aam logon ko fori taur par hoga, kyonki unhen aam bimariyon ke ilaaj ke liye dur nahin janaa hoga or paas ke in kendron se ilaaj kara sakenge
 Also, facilities related to health will also be provided
 beemaa to dur, shuruaati ilaaj main milegaa phaaydadusri ore, aam logon ko 5 lakh rupee kii beemaa kaa phayda tab milegaa jab beemaari badi yaa phir gambhir hone kii sthiti main vah hospital main bhartee hoga, lekin swasthya kendron kaa phayda chote or bade har tarah ke biimaar logon ko turant milegaa
 Until now there was a considerable distance from one health center to another health center in the country, but with the arrival of one and a half lakh new health centers, it would be accessible for sick people to get treatment close to home
 khaskar dur-daraaj or gramin anchalon main rahane vaale logon ke liye
 Their dependence on expensive private hospitals will be reduced
 nae collejon se aaenge nae doctorsone swasthya centre khulenge to doctoron kii jarurat bhi hogi
 In such a situation, the government has made a big plan to overcome the shortage of doctors in the country and for this, 24 district hospitals across the country will be upgraded and converted into medical colleges
 in medical collejon main ilaaj ke saath-saath nae doctors bhi taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 Today, there is a huge difference between doctor and patient in India and this ratio is 1: 1700
 jabaki vishwa swasthya sanghathan (WHO) ke anusaar 400 marijon par ek doctor hone chahie
 Under the new scheme, every 3 parliamentary constituencies or at least one medical college will be opened in a state
 philhal desh main nijee or sarkari donon medical collejon se har saal 67 hajaar embibies or 31 hajaar post graduate doctor paas hokar nikalate hai
 In such a situation, with the opening of many new medical colleges, the shortage of doctors will be removed and enough doctors will be able to treat people
 rojgaar bhi badhegaa24 jila hospitalon ko apgrade karte hue medical college khole jane or dedh lakh nae swasthya centre khole jane se desh main rojgaar bhi badhegaa
 Many types of facilities will be developed with the arrival of patients from the surrounding areas and the common people will benefit from it
 par kya yah itnaa aasaan hogaamodi sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi or chunaav se ek saal pehle elaan kiye gaye 'ayushmaan bharat' yojana kya kaamyaab ho sakegi
 This is the last full budget of the Modi government and during the speech, the finance minister did not discuss the amount to be spent on it
 abhi sirf elaan hi kiya gaya he or isaki ruparekha taiyaar hone main samay lag saktaa he
 If the government makes a detailed announcement in the next few months, then some talk can be made, but if it is delayed for more than 6 months, then by that time the electoral atmosphere will be created in the country and the BJP at the center is trying to preserve its power
 Will be busy
 phir iskaa bhavishya nai sarkaar par nirbhar karegaa
 The other side of it is also how it is implemented
 pehle bhi kai badi or mahatvakankshi yojana desh main shuru kii gai or iskaa hashr sabhi ne dekha
 Everyone knows the condition of the National Health Mission (NHM) announced by the Manmohan Singh government in 2005
 NHM ke tahat rashtriya gramin swasthya yojana (NHRM) apane ghotaale ke liye zyada charchaa main rahaa
 The performance of national insurance schemes has been very poor
 swasthya beemaa yojana bhi har ghoshnaa kii tarah lok-lubhaavni dikh rahi he, lekin isaki kamyaabi is par nirbhar karti he ki ise lagu kaise or kis tarah se saath hi kitni gambhirtha ke saath kiya jaataa he

 While the Delhi Police is preparing to interrogate former Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh in the cash-for-note scam, the Congress leadership is worried about what they will disclose
 police sutron ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki asainik parmaanu samajhaite par sansad main 2008 ke vishwaas mat main sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye paise dene ke maamle se amar singh ke jude hone ke bare main uske paas kaaphi saboot hai
 Three BJP mps had reached the Lok Sabha on July 28, 2008 with two bags full of money and accused Amar Singh of promoting defection
 lekin police jaananaa chaahati he ki thakur netaa kiski salaah par kaam kar rahe the
 While the government is gearing up for an uproarous monsoon session, Manmohan Singh's government, which is facing a crisis of credit, may be caught in another corruption scandal
 sarkaar kii vishwasaneeyata par pehle hi sawaal uth rahe hai
 In March, when the matter once again came to limelight through the wikileaks force, the Prime Minister assured the Lok Sabha that "no Congress party or government was involved in such illegal action during the 2008 confidence vote
" ''agar note kii aanch congress mukhyalay tak pahunchati he to 1993 se bhi zyada gambhir sankat paidaa ho saktaa he, jaisaa narsingh raav sarkaar ko jharkhand mukti morcha ke saansadon ko kathith taur par rishwat dekar vishwaas mat hasil karne par jhelana padaa tha
 According to police sources, former BJP Yuva Morcha activist Suhail Hindustani, currently in police custody and Amar Singh's PA, Sanjeev Saxena, has claimed that Amar Singh had given the cash
 badbhole hindustani ne to ghotaale main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii taraf bhi ishaara kiya he
 When detectives of the crime branch were taking Hindustani for questioning, he told the media, "I was called by people close to the Prime Minister and even from 10 Janpath
 ''saxena kii giraftaar ke baad se, amar singh najaron se dur ho gaye hai
 The person who had six press conferences a day when the scam surfaced, is escaping the media today
 samaajawaadee party chhodane ke baavjood, unamem itani takat he ki ve congress ke diggajon ko pareshaani main daal sakate hai
 Although Amar Singh will be interrogated, legal experts are unable to say whether he can be arrested as his role was that of a retrospective while Hindustani and Saxena are in tapes recorded during the sting operation

 The BJP maintains that it conducted a sting operation to expose the horse-trading of mps

 Hearing the petition filed by Lyngdoh, last week remarked, "are our investigative agencies so inefficient that even after two years, there has been no progress in a simple case?" Due to this, the police had so far not made any serious efforts towards investigating the matter, although a parliamentary committee had finalized its report in December 2008
 is samiti ke adhyaksh kishor chandra dev ne apni report main kaha tha ki is bare main kisi nattejey tak nahin pahunchaa ja sakaa ki kya ''shri sanjeev saxena jinhone teen saansadon tak dhan pahunchaaya vah doot the yaa amar singh ke ishaare par kaam kar rahe the

 Phone records confirming this conversation are with the Delhi Police
 yah baatcheet bhaajapa ke do saansadon ashok argal or pha ggan singh kulaste dwaara sansadeey samiti ke saamne die gaye bayaan kaa hissaa he
 Hindustani, who is said to be the link between BJP mps and Amar Singh, has already been detained under the Delhi Police anti-corruption Act 1988
 sutron ke mutabik hindustani ne amar singh par yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki bhaajapa ke teen saansadon ke liye unhone 3 karod ru
 Bribed ek kanoonee visheshgy kaa kahana he, ''agar yah sabit bhi ho jaataa he ki yah bhaajapa kii sochi gai or lagu kii gai 'pole kholane' kii karrwai thi, phir bhi upie bhi isse apana pallaa nahin jhaad saktaa
 "this is an issue that the UPA can use as a way to defend itself

 Thankfully, there is no Congress leader in the tap dealing with money
 police samaajawaadee party ke saansad revati raman singh, argal or laalkrishna adwani ke purv sahaayak sudhindra kulkarni se bhi poochtacha karne ja rahi he
 Kulkarni confesses that he underwent a sting operation to implicate the bribe payers
 amar singh kii mushkilen yaheen khatm nahin hotin
 Vishwanath Chaturvedi, a petitioner from Lucknow, has informed the Crime Branch about Amar Singh's alleged motive to get the UPA a trust vote during 2008
 yahi nahin, chaturvedi ne mulaayam singh ke khilaaf behisaab sampatti kaa maamla bhi daayar kar rakhaa he
 Chaturvedi says, "in the case of unaccounted property against Yadav, the government's" turn around "is a reward for his support to the government
 unka kahana he, ''amar singh bhi asainik parmaanu vidheyak ke paksh main the
 Chaturvedi says that he has given some documents to the Delhi Police which shows that Amar Singh was in the US in June 2008 and was in contact with American businessmen who would have become big suppliers after the nuclear deal was passed
 chaturvedi kaa daawa he ki unke paas pukhta saboot hai jo dikhaate hai ki amar singh ne us samay clinton foundation ko 10-50 lakh dollar die
 They allege that this money was given through hawala business in violation of Article 3 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act 2000
 arabiai ne isaki pushti kii he, ''hamane aisi koi rakam bhejne kii ijaajat nahin di
 "RBI has advised Chaturvedi that," He can go to the Enforcement Directorate regarding the money sent through hawala
 ''chaturvedi kaa aarope he, ''isse pataa lagata he ki amar singh kiske paksh main the
 "his allegations will later be important points in the investigation against Amar Singh, who will have to explain this amount
" saansadon ko di gai 3 karod ru
 The source of the bribe remains to be ascertained
 mana ja rahaa he ki amar singh ke purv sahaayak saxena ne dilli police ko bataaya he ki ve to mahaj courier the or unhen dhan ke strot ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Now the question before the investigating agencies is whether Amar Singh did this on his own to save the UPA or was he doing all this on the decree of the Congress? It will all depend on what they ultimately reveal

 isse europea sangh ko karj se ubharne main madad milegi
 If the Marines had won, France would have followed the path of Britain and America
 iskaa khamiyaja europea sangh ke saath puri duniya ko uthaanaa padataa
 Apart from this, the macro outlook is evolutionary like the Modi government, which talks about Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas
 aise main bharat ke liye macro behatar sabit honge
 Under his leadership, the indo-french relationship will touch new heights
 mana ja rahaa he ki maikron ke aane se donon deshon ke bich vyapaar main bhi ijapha hoga
 With this, his victory has further strengthened the foundation of democracy in France

 The core committee of Team Anna met in Ghaziabad on Monday in which the idea emerged that no one political party should be targeted in the future anti-corruption movement

 jaish-e-mohammed kingpin Masood Azhar spoke of waging a jihad against India against a large gathering of terrorists in Peshawar just 9 days before the Pulwama attack
 india today kii jaanch main ye saamne aayaa he
 Masood Azhar spewed poison against India at a rally of terrorists near the highway in the capital of Khyber Pakhtukhwa province
 bataa den ki khaybar pakhtunava soobe main pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii party PTI (pakistan taharik-e-insaaf) kaa varsh 2013 se raaj chalaa aa rahaa he
 The evidence available with India Today clearly shows that the terrorists' rally in the north eastern part of Pakistan was provided full police protection
 ek taraf imran jahaan aatankwaad ko unke desh ke samarthan se saafe inkaar kar rahe hai
 At the same time, a recording of Masood Azhar spewing poison against India at a rally in Peshawar on 5 February has exposed the claim of Imran
 imran ne mangalvaar ko pakistan televijan par apane sambodhan main kaha tha ki main bharat sarkaar ko jawaab de rahaa hum jisane pakistan par dosha (pulavama hamale ke liye) lagaaya tha
 There was no such evidence
 imran ne kaha tha ki agar bharat ke paas pulavama hamale main pakistani aatankiyon ke shaamil hone ko lekar intelegence he to wo pakistan ko uplabdh karaae
 Imran also said that he assures that action will be taken on him
 masood ajahar ne peshawar main tathakthith ‘kashmir ekajutata diwas’ ke maukey par khule aam bharat ke khilaaf aatanki hamale karne kii dhamkee di thi
 Explain that this alleged Kashmir solidarity day is celebrated by the Government of Pakistan all over Pakistan
 jaish se jude ek miseging channel se india today ko mili audio main jab ajahar jehad kii baat karata he to bharat virdohi naare or ‘naaraa-e-takabeer’ kii awaazen suni ja sakati hai
 Whatever the Jaish gangster speaks at the terrorists' rally indicates that the current regime of Pakistan has offered to give a complete atmosphere to the terrorist organizations to increase terrorist activities
 audio main masood ajahar chillaate suna ja saktaa he ki ab pakistan ke har ghar par jaish kaa jhanda lahraane kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 Masood Azhar also cites the presence of security personnel to patronize the rally of terrorists
 audio main ajahar kahata he, “hamane pakistan main wo vakt bhi dekha he jab vardi main in hamaare bhaaiyon ko hamaare jhande hataane ke liye kaha jaataa tha
 Those holding the flag of Jaish were asked to hold it
 ”ajahar kahata he, “aaj meri ankhen nam hai jab main in vardi vaale bhaaiyon ko yahaan hamaari raily main unheen jhandon ke neeche chalate dekhtaa hum
 In the audio, the sirens of the police are heard after a while
 5 farvari ke is audio main ajahar ko pulavama kaa hawala dete bhi suna ja saktaa he jahaan 14 farvari ko aatmghaatee hamalaa hua
 The name of only Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir from Azhar's side says a lot in itself
 ajahar ne 5 farvari ko kaha, “agar aap ‘pulavama se ek ladki’ ko google karo to aap dekhenge ki kashmir ke gaanvon ke gharon kii chhaton par jaish ke jhande or jaish pramukh (meri) kii tasviren dekhne ko milengi
 "earlier in some news reports, Jaish gangster was said to be seriously ill
 pulavama hamale ke do din baad pakistan ke soochna mantri fawaad choudhary ne daawa kiya tha ki sarkaar jaish-e-mohammad ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaaegi
 But Masood Azhar's Peshawar rally showed that he is carrying out terrorist activities from the land of Pakistan and he is fully allowed to do so
 pakistan ke punjab praant ke bahawalpur main kaint ilaake main masood ajahar kaa garh he
 He traveled to Peshawar on 5 February to speak at a rally of terrorists after traveling 800 km
 jaish sargana ne doharaaya ki wo imran khan sarkaar kii nigaebaani main apana jehad jari rakhega
 Masood Azhar threatened that attacks would be carried out in India by sending terrorists from different parts of Pakistan
 ajahar ne peshawar main 5 farvari ko kaha, ‘karachi, peshawar, bahawalpur or gujranvala samet pakistan ke vibhinn hisson se yuvak kashmir main jehad ke liye ja rahe hai or ye silsilaa aage bhi jari rahegaa
 Azhar also cited the elimination of his nephew Osman Haider in the hands of Indian security forces in October last year
 masood ajahar ne haidar ke maare jane kaa badla lene kii shekhi badhaarte hue kaha, “hamaare paas pehle afjal guru kii kabr thi, ab talha or osman ko bhi hamane qurbaan kar diya
 jaish-e-mohammed will continue to send people from all over the country (pakistan)

 The murderous attack on a servant in Jaipur has created a sensation
 khaas baat ye ki ye naukar viechpi netaa damodar modi kaa he

 The incident took place on Saturday

 kaha ja rahaa he ki inakam tex ke adhikariyon ne susheel se bhi kadi poochtacha kii thi kyonki modi kii kuch sampatti susheel ke bhi naam he

 On 9 June, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley launched an economic resolution on demonetisation, reversing the sharp opposition of the opposition
 is aarthik prasthaav main unka jor notebandi se jude phaayde se tha
 He said that the government knew that demonetisation would lead to a shortage of cash in India, but it would provide long-term benefits such as big and concrete steps towards digitization of the economy
 saath hi unhone kaha ki notebandi kaa makasad kaale dhan or bhrashtachar ko rokna tha jo kii kaaphi had tak safal rahaa
 Due to this, counterfeit notes coming from across the border were also stopped
 aatankwaad ko milane vaala fund bhi band ho gaya he jo kii unke life line par chot pahuchaata he
 In an interview to Bloomberg TV, Jaitley said, "we were aware of the fact that cash shortage due to demonetisation would adversely affect us for a quarter or two
" notebandi se baad ke sthiti ko unhone 'pavitra andolan' naam diya
 At the same time, the public accepted this problem with full enthusiasm
 notebandi ek saahasik kadam tha jo garibo kii bhalaai ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It is worth mentioning that the government had promised the people in the 2014 general election about black money and corruption, the government has now succeeded in making it successful
 jetali se jab poocha gaya ki kya notebandi safal rahi? to is par unhone kaha ki isse arthvyavastha ke digitalykaran kii disha main bade or thos kadam dekhne ko mili hai
 Due to this, black money has been deposited in banks

 chhattisgarh ke sukama main police or surakshabalon ke javaanon ne naksaliyon ke khilaaf ek baar phir oparation prahaar-3 laanch kiya he
 In the first phase of this operation, the soldiers demolished a large training camp of naxalites
 lekin surakshabalon ke badhate kadam kii soochna naksaliyon ko kaaphi pehle lag chuki thi
 So he considered it appropriate to run away from the spot
 haalanki, surakshabalon ne apane oparation main baari maatra main hathiyaar baraamad kiye hai
 Operation Prahar-3 was carried out in the forest of Sallatong at Dornapal in Sukma
 lagbhag ek hajaar jawan choubees ghante main 60 kimi kaa paidal safar tay kar is khatarnaak ilaake main pahunche the
 These jawans were sent to the Naxalite camp in seven separate troops
 is oparation ke dauraan surakshabalon ke jawan aise ilaake main pahunche, jo ab naksaliyon kaa garh mana jaataa he
 It is said that during this operation, Naxalites also had an encounter with police and central security forces personnel in one place
 is muthbhed main do jawan ghayal hue the
 He was admitted to the hospital overnight by helicopter
 oparation kii gopneeyata kaa hawala dete hue ek afasar ne bataaya ki is jagal main ek kimi ke daayre main chal rahaa naksali training camp unke javaanon ne dhwast kar diya he
 Police and central security forces personnel shared pictures of explosive material recovered from the camp from the police headquarters

 pakistani aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ko sanyukt raashtra kii vaishvik aatankiyon kii suchi main shaamil karaane ke bharat ke prayaas main china ne ek baar phir roda atka diya he
 China has asked for more time to investigate the subject on technical grounds
 isse pehle bhi china 3 baar masood ajahar par vito kaa istemaal kar chukaa he
 But experts say that this time was different, as India had the support of 4 permanent members of the Security Council along with 14 countries, on the other hand China seemed to support Pakistan alone on the issue of terrorism
 china kaa tark- or samay chahiechin ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki vaishvik aatankwaadi ke rup main jaish-e-mohammad ke pramukh masood ajahar ko soochibaddh karne ke maamle par china ko gahan jaanch karne ke liye or samay chahie
 China's position is in line with the UN sanctions committee rules, procedures
 'takneekee roak' yah sunishchit karne ke liye he ki china ke paas is maamle kaa adhyayan karne ke liye paryaapt samay mili
 China's effort towards india-china relationship is full of sincerity and is ready to work with India on the consent of the leaders (wuhan Summit) for greater progress in the relationship
 purv rajanyik or pakistan main bharat ke ucchayukta rahe ji
 Parthasarathy says that China has stopped the proposal to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist on technical grounds
 china kaa kahana he ki is vishay ke adhyayan ke liye use or vakt chahie
 This is just an excuse because even before this, China has used the veto on this issue thrice
 ab use or kitna vakt chahie?is baar alag tha mahaulparthasarathi kaa maananaa he ki vaishvik str par is baar maahaul alag he
 The resolution has been supported by 14 countries in the United Nations and 4 permanent members of the Security Council stand with India
 aisa pehali baar he jab bharat ko pakistan ke mudde par is tarah kaa samarthan mila
 It is obvious that on sensitive issues like terrorism, China itself has been a victim, it stands alone
 lihaaja ek tarah se dekha jaae to is maamle main vaishvik patal par china alag-thalag padataa najar aa rahaa he
 India is under pressure after the Pulwama attack
 After the Pulwama terror attack, India has been continuously pressuring Pakistan to take decisive action on terror through diplomatic channels
 videsh maamalon ke jaankaar or varisht patrkaar qamar aagaa kaa kahana he ki bharat ke paas financial acshan task force (FATF) main pakistan ko gherne kaa puraa mauka he
 Where evidence is already given to the action taken to stop terrorist funding under 10-point action plan on Pakistan
 pakistan ke paas june 2019 tak kaa samay he jab FATF main isaki samiksha kii jaaegi
 If Pakistan fails to satisfy the FATF, it will be put on the black list
 ek baar bluekalysted hone ke baad pakistan par aarthik pratibandh lagu ho jaaenge or nakadi sankat se jujh rahe paak ko international monitory fund se dhan milanaa band ho jayega

 champions trophy main guruuvar ko khele gaye pehle hi match main mejabaan england or bangladesh ke khilaadiyon ke bich maidan par tikhi bahes hui
 Apart from this, the moment also came in the match when a player was dishonest on the middle ground and he also clashed with the umpire to prove his point right
 ham baat kar rahe hai bangladesh ke openar tameem ikbaal kii
 Despite the absence of a catch, Tamim came in to bowl Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza in the 36th over of his unscrupulous England innings
 tabhi unke over kii chauthi gend par england ke captain oin morgan ne long on main ek shot khelaa jo tameem ikabal ke paas ja pahunchaa
 After which he falsely claimed to have caught the catch
 lekin riple main yah sabit ho gaya ki kaich nahin pakadaa gaya or morgan ko ampire ne note out qaraar diya
 But despite this, Tamim Iqbal appeared unhappy with this decision and also argued with the umpire
 iske baad bhi match haar gaya bangladeshis match main pehle ballebaaji karte hue bangladesh ne tameem ikbaal ke shatak kii badaulat england ko jeet ke liye 306 ran kaa target diya tha
 In response, England chased down the target 47
 2 over main hi 308 ran bana liye or ye match 8 wicket se apane naam kar liya
 For England, Joe Root produced a brilliant innings of 133 * and Alex Hales proved Bangladesh dwarfing the score

 The question is that even after so many years of independence, how long will Muslims continue to prove themselves as loyal citizens of this country? aisa nahin he ki hamid ansaari in sanghathanon ke nishane par pehali baar aae hon
 Sometimes he was accused of not saluting the tricolor on Republic Day and sometimes being absent on the occasion of Yoga Day
 lekin donon maukon par uparashtrapati sahi or sanvaidhanik line lete nazar aae
 On the contrary, those who accused him came from withdrawing their charges and apologizing
 maujuuda sarkaar sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas ke naare ke saath vishaal bahumat ke saath satta main ai he
 But at the moment it seems like a slogan
 musalamaanon ke bheetar ye ehsaas he ki na ve surakshit hai or na hi unhen insaaf mil rahaa he
 Recently, in Hashimpura (1987), in the case of murder of 42 Muslim youths, all the 16 convicts escaped due to lack of evidence
 dilli ke nazadik ballabhagarh ke ataali gaanv main ek masjid banane kii koshish karne par musalamaanon ke saath marpet kiya gaya, unke ghar lut liye gaye or unhen kai din tak thane main sharan leni padi
 These are incidents which do not suit any civilized society
 aaj zarurat he ki 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' ke naare ko sirf manchon tak na simit rakhaa jaae balki use jamini str par utaarne kii disha main sachche man se koshish kii jaae
 For this, the people of Muslim society, their associated institutions and representatives will also have to try hard to improve the current situation because the film 'manjhi' has two famous dialogues - Do not trust God, do you know God is sitting on us? 
 
 
 
 
 or haa jab tak todenge nahin, tab tak chodenge nahin
 
 yani muslim samaaj ko bhi apane prati faile bhram or shankaaon ko todane kaa prayaas tab tak karte rahanaa padegaa jab tak maanjhi kii tarah shankaa rupi is pahaad ko tod vishwaas or vikaas kaa ek sugam rasta nahin bana liya jaataa

 The people who took a morning outing in the Fundurdihari area of ambikapur town were shocked when a heavy man on the road was searching for his prey

 People started screaming
 saiyr sapate main nikle log is bhaaluu ko dekhakar ulte paanv daude
 Some people even brought sticks to save the passers-by
 shorgul sunakar bhaaluu ek ghar ke bageeche main ghus gaya
 In one corner of the garden he tried to hide himself
 bhaaluu ke aane kii khabar shahar main 'jangal main aag' kii tarah faili gai
 Police and forest department teams reached the spot, then Operation Jamwant started
 lagbhag 12 ghante kii kadi mashkkt or tranculizer kii do dose ke baad bhaaluu behosh hua
 Usually a flower dose of a tranquilizer makes animals unconscious
 bhaaluu ke behosh hote hi logon ne raahat kii saans lee
 The forest department team put him in a cage and turned to the forests
 bhaaluu ko ab taimor pingala abhyaarany main le jaakar choda jayega
 According to DFO Priyanka Pandey, this bear wandered from the forest and came to this area
 unhone bataaya ki samay par soochna mil jane se naa to jaan-maal kaa nuksaan hua or naa hi bhaaluu ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa

 India still need 47 runs to save the follow-on in the third cricket Test, while on Tuesday, England tightened their grip on the third day after a poor performance by the top-order batsmen
 bharat ne tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak aath wicket par 323 ran banaae hai or vah england se abhi 246 ran peeche he
 England declared their first innings ending at 569 for seven wickets
 is tarah se bharat ko abhi phaloan bachaane ke liye 47 ran kii darkaar he
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni 50 and Mohammed Shami were playing for four at the time of stumps
 bharat ke lagbhag sabhi ballebaaj acchhee shuruyaat ke baavjood bada score khadaa karne main naakaam rahe
 Cheteshwar Pujara (24), Murali Vijay (35), Virat Kohli (39), Ajinkya Rahane (52) and Rohit Sharma (28) lost wickets with irresponsible shots at a time when the team needed a long innings from them
 ravindra jadeja (31) bhi acchhee shuruyaat kaa phayda nahin uthaa paae
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has been consistently doing well with the bat, was also dismissed for 19 runs
 subah ek wicket par 25 ran se aage khilne ke liye utari bhartiya team ne pehle satr main hi pujaara or vijay ke wicket ganvaa die
 Meanwhile, he added 83 runs in 26 overs
 duusare satr main 28 overon main 106 ran bane, lekin is bich kohli or rohit pavilion laute
 India lost the wicket of Rahane early in the third season, who presented a good example of his skill and kept one end, but eventually he also rewarded the wicket like his other teammates
 england kii taraf se james anderson or stuart broad ne teen teen wicket liye jabaki moin ali ko do wicket mili
 Broad, in the morning, bowled out Pujara and Vijay in their six-over spell to put India at 88 for three
 vijay or pujaara ne team ko thos shuruyaat di
 Anderson took the ball in the morning, but was joined by Chris Vocus from the other end
 england kii yah saaf ranneeti thi ki ek samay main anderson yaa broad main se koi ek chor se gendbaaji kare
 This strategy proved effective
 pehle anderson ne apni swing se ballebaajon ko pareshaan kiya or baad main broad ne aakar unki pareshaaniyaan badha di
 The bowlers were not getting much help from the pitch, but some balls of these two bowlers made the batsmen confused
 pujaara out hone vaale pehle ballebaaj thi
 He wanted to drop Broad's short pitch ball in the 24th over of the innings, but, kissing his gloves, went to his first Test match playing wicketkeeper Jose Butler, who took his first catch in Test cricket
 pujaara ne 52 gend kii pari main teen chauke lagaaye
 In this way, the Saurashtra batsman continues to be unable to convert a good start into a big score in this tour
 broad ne iske baad vijay ko aaf stump se baahar kii gendon main uljhaaye rakhaa
 One such ball took the edge of the Indian batsman's bat and fell into the wickets
 iske baad rahane krij par utre
 In the 37th over of the innings it seemed that Moin Ali's ball was converted into a catch by touching his glove, but umpire Rad Tucker did not raise a finger
 kohli ko krij par utarane ke baad kuch visham palon se guzarana padaa, lekin phir unhone kuch achche shot lagaakar farm main vaapasi kii jhalak dikhaai
 Andersen again came as a threat to them
 unki swing gend kohli ke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar slip main elistare cook ke paas chali gai
 Kohli played 75 balls and hit three fours
 rahane or rohit ne bharat ko sankat se baahar nikaalane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Both of them batted sensibly and did not play any risky shot
 unhone paanchaven wicket ke liye 74 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 When it seemed that this partnership was going to prove important for India, Rohit lost his wicket by playing irresponsible shots
 rohit acchhee lay main dikh rahe the lekin unhone chaay ke vishram se kuch der pehle moin par lanbaa shot lagane ke prayaas main mid of par stuart broad ko aasaan kaich diya
 After tea, the same mistake was repeated by Rahane, who was still playing with complete restraint
 cook ne moin ko ek chor se lagaaye rakhaa or rahane ne aisi gend par apana wicket ganvaaya jise vah maidan par kisi bhi kshetra main aasaani se khel sakate the, lekin unhone use hawa main laharaa diya or mid aan par sabstitute fielder ne kaich karne main koi galati nahin kii
 Rahane's 113-ball innings included five fours
 jadeja ne phir jujharupan dikhaaya, lekin is baar anderson ke saath mukaable main baaji unke haath nahin lag paayi jinhone is bhartiya olerounder ko pagabaadha out karke dhoni ke saath unki 58 ran kii saajhedaari todi

 After that, they took the place of the closet in a new way, sometimes for a gangster's meeting, sometimes for recreation by watching dance, sometimes for getting drunk and sometimes for falling in love at first sight

 Let us first know its story

 Jatin's father (puneet Issar) helps Anna (ashish Roy) very much, due to which Anna calls Jatin and his father in their dance bar in a big celebration and at the same time, Jatin's eyes are fixed on Barkha's boisterous mannerisms

 In Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, a student found it expensive to write against her professor on Facebook

 However the student says that she did not mention any person in her Facebook post
 maamla bhopal ke motilal vigyaan mahavidhyalay (MVM) kaa he
 Asma Khan, a BSC second year student, was angry at the school not being allowed to celebrate Martyrdom Day on Bhagat Singh's death anniversary, but it proved costly for her to express her displeasure on Facebook
 jaankaree ke mutabik, asamaa khan chaatr sanghathan bhagat kranti dal (BKD) kii bhi sadsy hai
 BKD wanted to organize an event in the college auditorium on Bhagat Singh's death anniversary, but the college administration did not allow it
 college ke principal niraj agnihotri ne bataaya, 'bhagat singh kii punyatithi par 23 march ko do chaatr sanghathan- bikedi or akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (ABVP) college auditorium main kaarykram yojit karnaa chaahate the
 But both student organizations were not allowed to do this
 ijaajat nahin die jane ko lekar asamaa khan ne fasebuk par college ke teachers ko 'deshadrohi' kii sangya de daali
 He told that the decision to expose Asma Khan has been taken by the staff council of the college
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki asamaa khan ko yaa to apana fasebuk post delit kar dena chahie tha yaa maafinama sabamit karnaa chahie tha
 This is not acceptable
 lekin usne to ulate college par desh virdohi gatividhiyon ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope laga daalaa
 College Principal Agnihotri said that instead of apologizing, Asma Khan went with her lawyer and some supporters to pressure the college management
 kaarykram ke liye ijaajat na dene par principal ne kaha ki college is tarah ke kaaryakramon ke khilaaf nahin he, lekin sarkaar dwaara chal rahe ek training program ke chalate auditorium 20 march tak book tha
 And there was every possibility that this training program would run for a few more days
 unhone kaha ki agar bikedi koshahid diwasapar kaarykram karnaa hi tha, to ve college campus main kisi duusare sthaan par bhi ise yojit kar sakate the
 Expedited Asma Khan expressed dissatisfaction with the decision of the college and described it as a hasty decision
 asamaa kaa kahana he ki yah hairaan karne vaali baat he ki mahaj ek fasebuk post ke aadhaar par college athurities ne mujhe puure ek saal ke liye rusticket karne kaa faisla kiya
 Not only this, i was not even issued a show cause notice in this regard
 saath hi asamaa ne aarope lagaaya ki college prabandhan kaa faislaebivipi ke dabaav memlia gaya
 Asma says that ABVP is engaged in completely crushing their student organization BKD
 asamaa ne bataaya ki unhone vah fasebuk post 19 march ko daali thi, lekin thodi hi der baad unhone us post ko delit bhi kar di thi
 Osteoporosis is a common problem in the elderly or aging as well as weakening of bones, which increases their chances of rupture / fracture
 vishesh rup se kuulhe, ridh kii haddi or kalai kii haddi menfracturaki sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 In such a situation, even a slight injury or collision may cause injury
 health export kaa kahana he kiosteoposiske kaaran haddi tuutane kii sambhaavna 50 fisadi logon main hoti he, jabaki stan cancer kii sambhaavna 9 fisadi logon main or dil kii bimariyon kii sambhaavna 31 fisadi logon main hoti he
 Bone fracture due to osteoposis is a major problem, which often becomes severe with aging
 osteoporosis ke kaarnon ke bare main bataate hue health export ne kaha, 'aisi kaidavaayenhain jo osteoporosis kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Such as corticosteroid, anti-depressant, anti-hypertensive, anti-convulsive etc
 isliye in dawaaon kaa seven doctor kii nigaraanee main hi karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, medicines taken for stroke, hyperthyroidism etc
 also increase the chances of osteoporosis
 'health export ke mutabik, 'jis vyakti kii pehle kabhi haddi tuuti ho, bhavishya main usamen osteoporosis ke kaaran fracture kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Depression can also sometimes cause osteoporosis, because depression produces a hormone cortisol, which weakens minerals by absorbing minerals from bones
 'health export ne suzav dete hue kaha, 'saiyr or yoga karne se na keval mansapeshiyaan majboot hoti hai, balki sharir main calcium kaa santulan bhi bana rahata he
 But if your bones are weak then exercises like jogging, treadmill and tennis are not safe for you
 'unhone kaha, iske alaava calcium or vitamin di donon hi haddiyon ke liye bahut jaruri hai
 Bone patients should consume 1200 mg of calcium daily
 ek vyakti ko 700 milligram calcium apane aahaar se mil jaataa he
 Therefore 500 mg can be taken as a calcium supplement
 deyari utpaadon jaise doodh, cheez, yogart, hari patteydaar subjiyan, broccoli, soft bone fish main calcium bharpoor maatra main hota he
 Apart from this, vitamin d is also very important
 yah calcium ke avasorana main madad karata he
 Fortified diet, fish in salty water and liver is rich in vitamin D
 osteoporosis purushon or mahilaon donon main ho saktaa he
 But it is more likely after menopause in women
 osteoporosis aksar 55 saal ke baad mahilaon ko hota he
 However in men it increases the probability after the age of 65 years

 However, Rajnath said in gestures that surgical strike can be done against these 2 most wanted criminals
 rajnath ke kaha tha ki aatankiyon or aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf jo karnaa chahie, unki sarkaar kar rahi he, lekin parinaam aane main time lagata he
 Rajnath said that we had not made the announcement even while doing the surgical strike
 aise main hafiz said or daaud ibrahim ke khilaaf karrwai bhi bina koi ghoshnaa kii hogi, lekin jab hogi to logon ko pataa jarur chal jayega
 In the same program, Rajnath Singh had said that since the partition of independence, Pakistan is not descending from its nefarious designs
 haalanki grih mantri ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main pakistan ko munhtod jawaab dene kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Now it has to be seen whether Rajnath Singh's promise against Dawood and Hafiz is fulfilled

 dilli ke sankat mochan hanuman murti ko airlift karne kii baat saamne aate hi mandir ke pujari or bhakton ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya he
 The question is whether it is possible to move the 108 feet high huge Hanuman idol to another place by aerial means? In the whole case, the team of 'aaj Tak' has reviewed the temple and talked to the expert about how it is possible to airlift the idol weighing hundreds of tons
 trephic jam kii vajah se hataai ja rahi murtihanuman murti ko hataane kii mukhya vajah karol baag chauraahey par atikaraman or trephic jam kii samasya he
 However, for the last 2 decades, every Tuesday visitors to the temple believe that the problem of encroachment and traffic is in many areas of Delhi, then it is not right to remove the Hanuman idol alone
 obalm ke pratinidhi bhi kar chuke hai darshanapichley 15 saal se mandir main pujari ganesh dutt pandeya ne bataaya- jitani hanuman murti kii oonchai he, utani hi jameen ke andar gaharaai main murti kaa hissaa he
 There are also many caves under the statue
 jahaan maa kaali, maa vaishno devi ke saath-saath kai devi-devataaon kii murtiyon maujuud hai
 The priest claims that Obama's representatives came to this temple to seek blessings before he became president, after which he became president
 murti taiyaar hone main lage the 13 salmandir ke mahant kanhaiya ne bataaya ki hanuman murti ko taiyaar karne main 13 saal kaa vaqt laga
 According to Mahant, when the idol was built between 1994 and 2007, the surrounding forest was there
 us vakt sadak banane kaa koi project nahin tha
 Mahanta says that the court and the government should reconsider their decision
 kyonkihanuman kii murtysirf ek mandir nahin balki dilli or desh kii pahchaan he
 Pallavi, who lives in the unhappy Charol Bagh, often comes to buy lockets or threads from shops adorned outside the temple
 pallavi ne bataaya ki jab bhi kisi tivi serial yaa film main dilli kaa zikr hota he to shruwaat hanuman murti se hi hoti he
 Pallavi says that the Hanuman idol is a matter of great pride for her
 college kii padhai kar rahi pallavi maanati hai ki mahaj atikaraman kii vajah se murti hataane kaa faisla galat he
 Air Force Expert said- It is possible to airlift the 108 feet high Hanuman Murthy before the airlift needs assessment
 is par 'ajtak' ne captain sandip mehta se baatcheet he
 Sandeep Mehta says that weight is most important for air lift
 kyonkimurtika maamla he to iske alag-alag hisse karke nahin le ja sakate
 It is not possible to airlift the idol together
 agar duuri zyada nahin he or vajan kam he to kam eendhan ke saath 20 se 25 ton ko air lift kar sakate hai
 The Indian Army has capability, but it would be extremely important to assess weight and distance
 yah ilaaka behad bheedbhad vaala he isliye iskaa bhi aankalan jaruri he

 At the same time, Minister Radha Mohan said that the previous government visited the budget of Ministry of Agriculture during 2009-2014
 21 lakh karod rupee rakhaa tha
 At the same time, Modi government increased it to 2 during 2014-19
 11 lakh karod rupee kar diya
 Let me tell you that the debt waiver of farmers has become a big factor behind the defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recent assembly elections and the victory of the Congress
 ab loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar modi sarkaar kisaanon ko saadhane kii koshish main juty hui he
 For this, the government may also consider a scheme to give a fixed amount to farmers who sell crops at low prices in the coming budget to compensate for their losses
 sutron kii maane to modi sarkaar kisaanon ko phayda pahunchane jald hi alag-alag mantralayon ke saath baithak karke is yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar sakati he
 Under the medium term strategy, if the prices of crops fall below the Minimum Support Price (MSP), then there has also been a case of giving subsidy to farmers

 Rahul Gandhi's supporters will probably know this in advance
 lekin congress party ke upaadhyaksh ko vipashyana kaa sahaara lenaa padaa or myanmar main divangat satyanarayan goyanka ke aadhyatmik centre main 56 din kii chuttee main 34 din ek shabd bole bina hi bitaane pade
 Like the people who believe in the meditation tradition of Buddhism, they also tried to find themselves there
 yah unke or unki party ke liye bahut upyogi najar aa rahaa he
 Both his supporters and opponents are surprised by this change
 16 april ko unki vaapasi ke baad do hafte se bhi kam samay main aadhe-adhure man se raajnneeti karne vaala yah netaa ekaek dhuandhar bolne vaale saansad or vipaksh ke tejatarraar netaa ke rup main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 He has spoken four times in the Lok Sabha and several times outside it
 ve apane ghar ke baahar kisaanon se mil chuke hai, dilli main yojit raily main unhen sambodhit kar chuke hai, kisaanon se milane ke liye punjab ja chuke hai or khet, jameen or shram sudhaaron par modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf maharashtra ke vidarbha se desh bhar main padayatra shuru kar chuke hai
 Meanwhile, he also took time to visit the Kedarnath temple
 pahaad kii is mushkil yatra main unke shaareerik damakham se zyada or bhi bahut kuch dekhne ko mila
 If Rahul is running a long distance political race, then suddenly he has run quickly from behind and has reached among the other runners of the fast run
 is prakriya main ve kisaanon ke adhikaron se lekar net nirpekshata tak kaa rasta tay kar chuke hai or kedarnath ke darshan karke unhone party ke un hindu matadaataaon kaa man dobaaraa jeetne kaa bhi sookshm rajnatik sandesh de diya he, jo paramparaagat rup se congress ke samarthak hua karte the
 They have also found new ways of targeting the government
 ab ve rajnatik virodhiyon ko chaturaai bharaa jawaab dene kii kala main bhi maahir ho gaye hai
 On April 29, for example, he criticized the Modi government's ambitious Make in India campaign, saying that the government was ignoring farmers who swept the crop in India and this was just the beginning
 yah uttaradhikari pichley loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar dekhne ke baad party ko dobaaraa khadaa karne kii yojana bana chukaa he
 The plan is the result of discussions with over 400 Congress leaders for two months at the end of last year
 is yojana main chaar-stareey ranneeti banaai gai he—jamini str par party ko majboot karo, un muddon ko uthaao, jinase zyada se zyada log jude hon taaki congress ke paramparaagat samarthakon kaa man phir se jeeta ja sake, jin rajyon main congress vipaksh main ho, vahaan kii sarkaar ke khilaaf mudde uthaakar sadakon par lagaataar virodh pradarshan karo, or musalamaanon ke tushtikaran jaisi un galatiyon ko sudhaaro, jinaki vajah se 2014 ke chunaav main party kii durdasha hui thi
 Although Rahul had made his plan in February itself, but he was not sure when to start it
 unke kuch sudhaaron ko lekar puraane netaaon ke kade virodh or sonia gandhi ke man main party ke bheetar vidroh ke shuruaati bhay kii vajah se rahul kii yojana amal main laane main deree hoti gai
 Says a Congress general secretary, "rahul's long leave gave his mother an opportunity to create a conducive atmosphere within the party to fix everything and hand over the command to Rahul
 "sonia ne achaanak jab saamne aakar kisaanon kaa mudda uthaaya or bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kaa virodh kiya to niraashaa ke daur se guzar rahe congress kaaryakartaaon main ummid kii lahar daud gai or unamem nayaa josh paidaa ho gaya
 He also persuaded his son to postpone his plan to make organizational changes and assured him that the party's top leaders would not stall his way
 in kadamon kaa nateezaah rahul ab kuch yuva netaaon ko usamen shaamil karne ke alaava akhil bhartiya congress samiti main koi bada badlaav nahin karenge
 The only major change expected is that Ahmed Patel, Sonia's political secretary, can be made the treasurer of the party in place of 86-year-old Motilal Vora
 sonia ne apana sandesh spasht kar diya haih rahul ko apana kaam karne do or ve khud puraane bade netaaon kaa khyaal rakhengi
 Some Congress leaders who met Rahul last year had advised him to travel across the country and spend at least two days in a state
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mukhya vipakshi netaa ke rup main unhen jab nae sire se utaara jane vaala tha, tabhi bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon or kuch rajyon main bemausam barsaat kii vajah se fasalon kii barabaadi kaa mudda khud ba khud unke haath lag gaya
 On April 30, he started a march from Vidarbha in Maharashtra against the policies of the Modi government on farmers, land and labor reforms
 unka yah faisla purv pradhanmantriyon—indira gandhi or rajeev gandhi kii ranneeti se prerit he, jinke netritv main kramshah 1977 or 1989 main party ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 Both those leaders then traveled the country to reconnect with the public and party workers
 rahul ke kareebi congressi netaaon kaa kahana he ki unka yah nayaa avatar aprihaary tha kyonki raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke baad pehali baar ve vipaksh main hai
 The party's Mumbai unit president Sanjay Nirupam says, "the Congress has been in power ever since he came to the party in 2004
 iske baavjood unhone jab bhi koi kami dekhi to sarkaar kii aalochana kii or bhatta-parsul main kisaanon or niamgiri main adivaasiyon ke adhikaron ke liye aawaaj uthaai
 Now they are in opposition and they will fight fiercely in this new role
 " rahul apane nae rup main kuch gine-chune salaahkaaron par nirbhar nahin hai
 a Congress leader in Uttar Pradesh says, "now they listen to everyone, but the decision is their own
" ve har kshetra se aae logon kii baat par gaur karte hai, chaahe vah shiksha, enjio, raajnneeti se judaa koi bhi vyakti ho
 "therefore, while the suggestion to visit Kedarnath was made last year by the newly appointed Pradesh Congress President, the issue of net neutrality was inspired by a newspaper article written by former MP Milind Deora
 puraane dinon ke ulat ab ve faisle lene main aage rahete hai
 On April 22, when a farmer allegedly committed suicide at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) public meeting in Delhi, he immediately called Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot before going to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where the farmer's body was kept
 And instructed them to meet the family of that farmer
 isse saaf he ki ve kisi bhi anya party ko vipaksh kii jagah hathiyaane se rokane ke liye puri tarah katibaddh hai
 Social media bets Congress leaders believe that Rahul needs to change some of his personal strategies
 masalan, samvaad sthapit karne kaa unka tarika
 Leaders like Digvijay Singh have openly appealed to him to join social media, but this heir of the Gandhi family has so far ignored it
 november main congress ke ek netaa ne jab unhen bataaya ki ve twitor se judakar kis tarah lakhon logon se sampark bana sakate hai to rahul ne unase kaha ki unhen yah sab bada jatil lagata he or iske liye unke paas paryaapt samay nahin he
 But this thing of Rahul is not digestible, as he has often been seen getting entangled in his smart phone
 lekin uttar pradesh par jis tarah dhyaan diya ja rahaa he, vah is baat ko jaahir karata he ki rahul ko ab acchhee tarah ehsaas ho gaya he ki party ko pradeshon main majboot karnaa hoga or isi vajah se ve pradesh ikaayiyon ke adhyakshon kaa chunaav kar rahe hai or unki niyuktiyaan kar rahe hai
 For those who have been appointed, the instructions are clear - include true workers in the party from the booth level, communicate hope and instill discipline in the minds of the desperate workers
 ab bada sawaal yah he ki kya rahul is jazbe or josh-kharosh ko aage barkaraar rakh paaenge, khaskar yah dekhte hue ki aglaa loksabhaa chunaav hone main abhi chaar saal baaki hai
 Or is his passion like a temper in the cauldron, as seen earlier in his case, when he raised the issue of tribals in bhatta-parsaul and Niamgiri
 unhone isi tarah kaa josh dikhaate hue sajayaftaa netaaon ko bachaane vaale adhyadesh ko sabake saamne faad diya tha or phir achaanak kahin gaayab ho gaye the
 Not everyone is willing to believe that this time it will not happen
 yahaan tak ki khud unki party main kuch log aisa maanate hai
 a veteran leader from Maharashtra says, "what they are doing right now is very good
" par unamem party kaa netritv sanbhaalane kii kaabiliyat nahin he
 They are not right to take command of the party
 " is dharna ko galat sabit karnaa rahul kii sabase badi chunauti hogi

 Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf said on Wednesday that he was proud of the Kargil campaign during which Pakistani troops crossed the Line of Control and entered the Indian border in 1999
 musharraf se jab karachi main ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kargil mudde main unki bhoomika kii aalochana ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone ukt tippanee kii
 Musharraf was the chief of the Pakistani Army during the Kargil campaign
 baad main vah pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii sarkaar ko giraakar satta par kabiz ho gayi
 Musharraf said, 'I am proud of the Kargil campaign
 ’ kareeb chaar saal tak swa nirvaasan main rahane ke baad ravivaar ko pakistan laute purv raashtrapati ne kaha ki unhone apni vaapasi ke liye kisi se koi samjhauta nahin kiya he
 Musharraf claimed that he had returned to Pakistan in the interest of the country and the public
 pakistan aane ke baad apni pehali press conference main purv sainya shaasha ne kaha, ‘main un logon main se hum jo desh or uske nagarikon ke bare main sochate hai
 "musharraf, who returned to the country to lead the All Pakistan Muslim League party for the general elections to be held in Pakistan on May 11, said he could not say for now how many seats his party could win

 The politics of the country has a long history of raging leaders
 khaskar chunaav ke vakt netaaon kaa aakraamak hona aam he
 But the extent is beaten when, in order to dominate their rivals, many times they do not resort to profanity as well as refrain from using profanity
 pichley dinon aam aadmi party ke netaaon ne aisa hi kiya
 Then the Congressmen got angry
 unhone 'aap' netaaon ko shaleenta ke bare main bataaya
 He said that decency of language is necessary
 lekin ab khud congressi aisi hi bhashaa kaa istemaal karte dikh rahe hai
 They think that by using such language, they will hit the ground or add excitement to their supporters
 chunaav, netaa or kund hoti sochalagta he kai baar chunaav ke samay netaaon kii soch kund ho jaati he
 They want to injure the opponent with a word of words
 chunaav maidan main aate hi jaise unka khun khaulane lagata he or ve chuninda shabdon kii barish kar dete hai
 Even during Anna's movement, many Congress leaders lost their temper and started using the words ul-julul
 vahiin, ab dekhne main aa rahaa he ki narendra modi kaa naam aate hi kai congressi netaa bhashaa kii shaleenta to kya apana aapa tak khone lage hai
 At times it seems that they have become frustrated
 sambhav he ki yah unki hataasha or kuntha kaa parinaam ho
 Now Khurshid Sahab has started speaking a similar language
 narendra modi ke liye jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa unhone istemaal kiya uske bare main kya kaha jaae? vah videsh mantri ke mahatvapurn pad par asin hai
 And this post is one where diplomacy works, not words
 lekin unhone maryaadaaon tak kii parvaah nahin kii
 It is surprising to hear such things from a highly educated leader
 gaayab ho rahe bhadrata, maryaada jaise shabdabhartiya raajnneeti main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 The way of thinking of politicians is changing
 unke liye ab satta se zyada kuch bhi myne nahin rakhata
 It seems that they can go to any extent for that
 maryaada, shaleenta, bhadrata jaise shabd ab dictionari main hi dikhne lage hai, saamaanya vyavhaar main to ye gaayab hote ja rahe hai
 Who will tell the people of the country about the words, this is a big question that will keep the common people busy

 However, Alia is trying to handle the matter in a very mature manner and reacts calmly to Kangana's sharp response
 aalia ne haal hi main ek intervyuu main kaha - 'agar kangana ko mujhase kuch shikaayat he to main unase persenalee baat karne kii koshish karongi
 i do not want to talk to the media about this

 He said - 'I have said before that i like him a lot as an actor
 mujhe unki filmon kii chois kaaphi pasand he

 It is worth noting that Kangana's film Manikarnika is a few steps away from earning 100 crores while Alia's Gully Boy is going to be released on February 14
