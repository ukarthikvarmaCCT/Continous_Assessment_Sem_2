 After it is completely eroded, they are filtered by putting them in clothes and after that, pure pure herbal color is prepared

 Lunch ke baad aana # indvsa — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 4, 2018 Centurion ODI umpire Aleem Dar, Adrian Holdstoke and match referee Andy Pycroft have mocked TV commentators and cricket experts
 westeindies ke purv diggaj maaikel holding ne is faisle ko haasyaaspad qaraar diya
 Commenting, he said, "they (ICC) want to make the game attractive but it is a ridiculous decision
" 'jeet ke liye chahie the 2 ran, ampire ne kaha- kar lo lunch, khilaadi se lekar darshak hairaanaye tha puraa maamlatim india ne south africa ko 32

 lekin jab bhartiya team jeet se sirf 2 ran dur thi, tabhi ampiron ne lunch brake kaa elaan kar diya
 This decision of lunch break was quite shocking when the team needed only 2 runs to win
 is faisle se khilaadi, darshak or camentator hairaan the
 However, the umpires stuck to the rules, which led to the Indian resuming after a 40-minute lunch break and scored two runs to take a 2–0 lead in the six-match series

 Actually 'hindutva' for 'hindu' means the same as 'christianity' for 'christian'
 yah buniyadi vyakaran kaa maamla he ki yah bhavvaachak sangya he, jo visheshan yaa sangya main vyutpatti tv, yaa yat ko jodakar banaai gai he
 In this form it describes 'his heart or principle'

 The Hindu is said to be good, who remains humble and submissive in spite of his bad behavior, simply because his everlasting quality is his 'tolerance'
 magar jab vah apane mulyon par jor detaa he yaa uske liye ladata-jhagadata he, tab vah 'bura' ho jaataa he yani 'hindutv' vaala yaa 'dusron ke prati ashishnu' hindu ho jaataa he
 It is said with great arrogance that we accept Hinduism, but reject Hinduism, which means that the attempt to 'be Hindu' is rejected
 is pechida daleel kaa kul matlab yah nikalataa he ki ''tum hamen apni beijjati or avmaananaa karne do to tum hamen sweekaar ho
 However, if you retaliate to our attack on your fundamentals (values, beliefs, symbols, heroes) then we will call you 'fundamentalist', 'fascist' and therefore degenerate or regressive

 At the same time it is promoted as the 'ideology' of Hindu civilization, not as the 'essence of Hindu civilization', but as its distorted creation or creation
 magar sachaai yah he ki hindutv kaa sidhaa-sada matlab 'hindu hona' he
 There are also Hindus who consider themselves to be Hindus because of their coincidence of being born in this religion, because it does not matter much to them whether they are Hindu or non-hindu
 ve hindu dharm ko nicha dikhaane ke visheshadhikaar kaa daawa karte hai, is bina par ki ve bhi aakhirkaar 'hindu' hai: par asal main unki keval paidaaish hi hindu pariwaron main hui he
 Such fashionist secularists have almost abandoned their 'hindu-pun'
 hindupan ke bare main uske virdohi or himachati donon pehle se hi kaaphi kuch kehete aa rahe hai or lagaataar kah rahe hai
 The disturbances surrounding the concept of Hindupan have added to the intricacies of this work which is mainly due to the intellectual freedom that goes to the extent of irresponsibility achieved in India
 hindu chetana ke nae sire se ubhaar ke bare main 1980 or uske baad ke dashakon main nishpaksh anusandhan bhi nahin kiye ja sake or isaki vajah thi hindutv ko lekar siyaasi mansoobon se prerit bahut zyada bahes-mubahise or beete jamaane kii us maansikta se upji intahaai berukhi, jisamen kisi bhi hindu cheez ke bare main khuleam baat karnaa abhishaap mana jaataa tha
 This inaction of the academic community as well as the pre-existing temptation to be politically correct contributed to increasing political-ideological untouchability in many ways
 isaki vajah se hindutv ko ek nazaij vichaardhaara sareekhee cheez ke taur par pesh karne kaa hindutv-virodhiyon kaa kaam or aasaan ho gaya
 Hindustan has been a witness to the divisive socio-political movements that have arisen since 1947
 yah keval ram janmabhumi andolan hi tha, jisane hindu samaaj ko ek aise mudde par ekajute kiya, jo unke liye apane vajood ko bachaane kaa mudda tha
 It managed to deliver the message of Hindu unity so heavily that it became difficult for hundreds of left-wing scholars to explain how Hindus could come together and come together on the strength of a movement which they have seen as the reclusive and upper caste Was seen as a movement of castes
 ram janmabhumi andolan ke chalate hindu kam se kam kuch vakt ke liye apni choti-choti jatigat pahachaanon ko bhul gaye or zyada badi saanskrithik pahchaan—yani hindu—ke bare main sochane ko baadhya hue
 Despite the success of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Hindupan was only interpreted as stubborn misery
 puja-archana ke liye bahut saare devi-devataaon kii maujuudagi or puja ke taur-tareekon sahit vyaavhaarik taur par jivan ke harek kshetra main vividhta kii vajah se unhen ek baade main gherna hindu dharm pranali main or uske natijatan hindu vishwa nazariye main na to chaha gaya he or na hi mumkin he
 This is a complete refusal of fencing in which spiritual democracy — which for its non-physical, moral resonance — is a preferential Indian idiom over English's 'virtual democracy'
 aadhyatmik loktantr hindu aasthaa or manyataon kii akeli sabase khaas or sabase alahada khubi he
 Hinduism, unlike many other religions and beliefs, never presents itself as the only way to salvation or salvation
 iske ulat, hindu dharm maanata he ki sabhi maarg ek hi satya, ek hi sarvashaktimaan kii taraf le jate hai
 The same principle and belief is widely reiterated in this statement: "ekamadat, Vipra vadha vadantyir" and this is the foundation of Hindu spiritual thought
 aaj jab samoochee duniya dehshatgardi ke rujhaanon ke teevr khatre se do-chaar he or jab dehshatgardi kii buniyadi jad anivaary taur par dharm pranali kii shreshthata se prerit nazariye se judi ho, tab hairaani hi jaahir kii ja sakati he ki aadhyatmik loktantr ko sweekaar kiye bagaiyr maanavtaa aakhir kaise kaayam rah sakegi? yah hakeekat he ki jatvaad sareekhee vikrutiyon ne hindu nazariye kii jadon ko khokhla kar diya he, balki adarsh to yahi hoga ki hindupan kii manyata main jati ke aadhaar par kisi bhi bhedbhaav kii bilkul koi gunjaaish na ho
 Aryan attacks, conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous people, differences between native settlers or tribals and others, calling certain social groups or communities as innate criminal or conflict between the victors and the vanquished There can be no place in the concept of Hindupan

 It would not be an exaggeration to say that only the privileged and relatively unfortunate sections of society have to decide that the socio-economically weaker sections get equal protection, respect and opportunity

 One of the features of the Hindu outlook on the world is its continuous development
 nit nutan, chir-puraatan hamaari soch kii buniyaad he
 How then can Hindus be anti-modern? In the sixth century BC, the Buddha turned the Hindu psyche from orthodoxy to logic, which was the exaltation of Renaissance modernity
 hinduon ko is hakeekat ko sweekaar karne kii chunauti kaa bhi saamana karnaa hoga ki takneekee taur par hindu dharm bhi duusari vishwaas pranaaliyon yaa manyataon kii tarah hi he
 But in practice it is more than just beliefs, because it does not have the tendency to believe only one Prophet, only a holy book, or only one God, as is believed in most Semitic or Semitic religions

 His statement read how easy it is for political parties to become leaders
 janata hi bekaar main netaa dhundti rahati he
 If according to Paswan, someone has to sit on that post, then his name should be mentioned before the election
 bijepi chunaav ke pehle netaa kaa naam nahin bataaegi is baat ke baad bhi ki yah chunaav uske liye jeene marane kaa chunaav he
 Ram Vilas Paswan, who has turned into a natural ally of BJP, also said that Bihar election is a question of life and death
 itane bade chunaav main bijepi kisi netaa kaa naam bataane kaa daanv nahin chalegi yah bhi kam vicitra nahin he
 The BJP does not have a leader shortage, but the question is whether it has the courage to name the leader before the election
 netaa kaa naam sirf nitish kumaar kii vajah se hi nahin bataa rahi hogi
 It is also possible that if one is told, the castes of other potential leaders get hurt
 bihar kaa chunaav is baar netaa or vikaas ke liye nahin, jatigat sambhaavnaaon ke liye ho rahaa he
 One caste will lose, one caste will win
 kuch jatiyon hongi jo haarane or jeetne vaali jati ke peeche malgadee ke dibbe kii tarah lagi rah jaaengi
 BJP will not reveal the name of the leader before the election even after the fact that this election is an election for him to die
 bijepi ke swaabhaavik sahyogi main dhal chuke ramvilas paswan ne bhi kaha ki bihar chunaav jivan-maran kaa sawaal he
 in such a large election, it would not be a bet to tell the name of a leader of the seed 
 bijepi ke paas netaa kii kami nahin he, lekin sawaal yah he ki chunaav se pehle netaa kaa naam bataane kaa saahas he yaa nahin
 Nitish Kumar's name will not be revealed only because of the leader
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki ek kaa bataaya to duusare sambhavit netaaon kii jatiyon ko thes pahunch jaae
 Bihar is being elected this time not for the leader and development, but for caste prospects
 ek jati haaregi,ek jati jeetegi
 There will be some castes, which will be left behind the winning and winning caste like a wagon

 Former Army Chief General VK Singh said on Friday that the incident of gang rape of a student in a moving bus is indicative of 'complete collapse of administration'
 iske saath hi unhone police par aarope lagaaya ki police bal rajdhani main ati vishisht logon kii ‘suraksha agency se adhik kuch nahin’ he
 Singh said that the system has been 'completely exposed' because not only was a daughter boarding the bus on the trust of this system, but hundreds of other daughters are also facing this kind of threat on the part of the attackers because the system takes any action Can't do it and this' impotence is increasing
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bedadak shahar main gumti ek bas main 23 varshiya chaatra ke saath jaghanya gangrape or nrushans hamalaa is baat kaa sanket he ki prashasan puri tarah dhwast ho chukaa he
 This incident should shock the entire system
 ’singh ne kaha, ‘main is bahadur ladki ke jinda rahane kii prarthana karata hum or meri samvednaaen uske parivaar ke saath hai
 We can't leave it like the Jessica Lal case
 us maamle main yadi uske parivaar kaa prayaas nahin rahata to uske hatyare phir se khuleam ghoomte
 The system has received its biggest warning
 hamen jaagnaa hoga , isse pehle ki bahut der ho jaae
 He stressed that providing security is the affidavit duty of every government, especially the police and judiciary
 unhone kaha lekin iske bajaay ‘ham aisi sthiti main hai jahaan lagbhag har roj prashasan ke har santhaan kaa ksharan ho rahaa he
 Singh said, "today, every agency that has been entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining police and law and order in the state is nothing more than an agency providing security to the so-called 'VVIP class' and rich and famous people of Delhi
 Has gone
 ek ausat naagarik ke liye gambhir se gambhir maamle main bhi maamla darj karana ek prakaar se asambhav he
 In such a situation, leave aside the idea of getting any kind of justice
 ’unhone kaha, ‘police or suraksha agenciyon ko unka kaam karne diya jaae, shaasha varg dwaara vyavhaar ke naitik maapdand sthapit kiye jane chahie
 Every policy decision taken due to narrow political constraints destroys our system and has negative effects on internal and external security
 ’singh ne kaha, ‘aaj hamaare desh ke samaksh spasht sandesh he ki keval paisa hi myne rakhata he
 How you make this money does not matter
 yadi aapke paas paisa he to aap surakshit hai, anyathaa aapaki jindagi narak he

 arthvyavastha kii haalat se lekar kisaanon ke halaat, mob linching, kashmir kii siyasat, vishesh rajya kaa darja jaise kai ahm mudde hai jinaki gunj 18 july se shuru ho rahe satr main sunai degi
 But the challenge before the government is not just opposition but also allies
 tidipi ne todaa tha nathapichley bajet main apni maangon ko lekar adi tidipi ne bich satr ke dauraan hi sarkaar kaa saath choda tha
 The TDP, which was part of the NDA, was seeking special state status for Andhra Pradesh
 saath hi rajya ke liye vishesh aarthik sahaayta bhi uski praathamikta thi
 This time TDP is standing in opposition but allies like Shiv Sena and JDU can present a challenge before the government
 sahyogi kii maangon ko sarkaar sire se narnandaaj bhi nahin kar sakati or vipaksh kii tarah unpar sidhaa hamalaa bhi aasaan nahin hoga
 The attitude of Shiv Sena Sena Sena attacker on the government is not hidden from anyone and she has been barricading against Modi government on many occasions
 mahangaai kaa mudda ho yaa phir kashmir ke bigade halaat, har maukey par shivasena ne sahyogi hone ke baavjood modi sarkaar ke khilaaf kadaa rukh akhriyaar kiya he
 The government is unlikely to ally with the Shiv Sena even in the upcoming session
 alam yah he ki maan munwwal kii koshishon ke bich bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne uddhav thakare se mulaakaat bhi kii lekin vah bhi benatija sabit hui
 Even during the last budget session, the Shiv Sena was rebuffed by the nda's decision not to take salary on behalf of mps, showing rebellion
 nitish ko chahie vishesh rajyadusari sahyogi party jediu kaa rukh shivasena kii tarah mukhar to nahin lekin siyaasi taur par majboot to jarur he
 jdu's new ally of power in Bihar needs special state status for its state
 saath hi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main usne bijepi se zyada siten bhi maangi he
 On this issue, Amit Shah and JDU Chief Nitish Kumar have met in Delhi
 siton kaa ganit abhi tay nahin he or vishesh rajya kaa darja bhi thande baste main padaa he
 Nitish Kumar's party has sought a special state from Bihar to Bihar on several platforms
 pichley dinon niti ayog kii baithak main piem narendra modi ke saamne nitish ne apni maang doharaate hue andhra pradesh tak ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa samarthan kiya tha
 But if the JDU raises this demand within the Parliament, then it can create problems for the government
 rajyasabha main upasabhapati chunaav ke maddenjar endie apane kisi sahyogi ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahegi
 In the Upper House, the BJP is less in number, so if the allies are away then it will be a difficult time for the government
 2019 ke chunaav se pehle endie har haalat main apana khemaa majboot rakhana chahta he saath hi sansad ke monsoon satr main kai ahm vidheyak lambit hai jinhen sahyogiyon ke saath ke bina paarit karana or mushkil ho saktaa he

 dehradun main bijepi daftar kaa drishy: shanivaar ko yahaan holi or diwaali ek saath manaai ja rahi thi
 On the one hand, firecrackers were burning and on the other side the colors of Holi were scattered everywhere
 jo naare gunj rahe the usamen sabase adhik sunai de rahaa tha – ‘har har modi
 
 
 Ghar ghar Modi 'and with these slogans there was a big cut out of Modi
 khushi ke isi huddang ke bich reporting karte hue ek awaz mere kaanon main padi
 Seeing this colorful atmosphere, a supporter of the BJP told his partner, "this is exactly Shiva's avatar brother
 
 The incarnation of Shiva
 ” modi ke bare main ye bayaan uttarakhand se lekar uttar pradesh or hindi pattee ke un rajyon main bijepi ko mili janadesh ke peeche kii kahani bhi he jahaan pichley teen saalon main party failati gai he
 In the last three years, Modi has climbed the ladder of popularity among common voters
 lekin kul logon ke liye wo divine avatar ban gayi hai
 The things he has included in his politics are also the result of social and economic equality and the appeal of the campaign against corruption along with nationalism
 modi jab bhaashanon main kabristaan or shmashaan vaale bayaan dete hai to samaaj ko ek bade hisse ko upekshit se vishesh or sangrakshit hone kaa ehsaas miltaa he
 The manner in which Modi presents him with the country's dignity and respect for the soldiers after the surgical strike makes a common voter realize that the initiative has been taken to secure the country's borders for the first time
 purv generalon ne tivi kaha ki sargical strike pehali baar nahin kii gai lekin pradhanmantri ne sena kii karrwai ko jis andaaz main apane bayanon or bhaashanon main pesh kiya usase ‘hataash’ logon ko pehali baar ‘atmasamman’ kaa bodh hua
 Narendra Modi beats his opponents in many cases and seems to have a lot to learn from Modi on many fronts
 akhilesh yadav kaa bayaan ki vot matadaata ko samajhane se nahin bahakaane se milte he isaki ore ishaara karata he
 That is, Modi is giving his voters the confidence that they have not got
 misaal ke taur par notebandi se kisaan bhi pareshaan huye, chote kaarobaari bhi or garib log bhi
 The work was destroyed and many people lost their jobs
 purv vittamantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki upi or uttarakhand main mili jeet notebandi par janamat sangrah nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki baaki teen rajyon punjab, goa or manipur main phir aapako iske ulat maananaa hoga
 Even after all the problems caused by the ban on demonetisation, if people vote for the BJP, then it must be believed that Modi succeeded in convincing the people that his move was against corruption, terrorism and black money
 jamini reporting karne vaale har patrkaar ne logon ke munh se ye suna – ‘haa dikkat to he lekin desh ke hit main he ye kadam
 'it is important here that this step is not only in the interest of the country, but the people are also engaged in personal interest
 modi ne logon se kaha – ‘unhone lutaa, main lautaaungaa’ or logon ko ye mahasoos hua ki ab wo un amiron ke baraabar ho gayi hai jinhone kaala dhan jamaa kiya
 It is also to be noted that the BJP did not give any Muslim a ticket in UP as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kaa kadam bhale hi hindu dhruvikaran ke liye ho lekin modi or amit shah kii jodi ne ise pragatisheel raajnneeti ke namoonay ko taur par pesh kiya he
 In the UP elections, the BJP has won a large number of seats which had a Muslim majority population
 jat bahul aabaadi vaale ilaakon main ek baar phir se bijepi kaamyaab hui he to usne devband jaisi seat bhi jiti he
 The comments modi ke mantri unke nerrative ko aage le jate hai
 That is why instead of making any harsh statement on the students of ABVP who are hoodwinks, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says that India is the only country where it seems wrong to talk about nationalism, then Amit Shah uses the word Kasab for Congress, BSP and Samajwadi Party Even after that, people are able to say that people are bored of religion and caste politics and they want development
 yani narendra modi ne apni prachaar style se hindutv ke mudde ko chhadam secular vaad or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf jang main badla he or ab sari ‘secular’ partiyon kii vishwasaneeyata khatm karnaa bijepi kii pramukh ranneeti rahegi
 Not only this, the way he has associated his economic move like demonetisation with surgical strikes and nationalism is a mixture that is making him popular among the voters of all parts of the country
 is takat se nibatane se pehle unke virodhiyon ko yaad rakhana hoga ki modi shiv ke avatar vaali chhavi hasil kar chuke hai
 Amidst this same joyous joy, a voice came in my ears reporting
 is rangeen maahaul ko dekhakar bijepi ke ek samarthak ne apane saathi se kaha, “ye to bilkul shiv kaa avatar he bhai
 
 shivaji kaa avatar
 This statement about Modi is also the story behind the mandate given to the BJP in the states of Uttarakhand to Uttar Pradesh and Hindi belt where the party has been spreading in the last three years
 modi pichley teen saalon main aam voter ke bich lokapriyata kii aasamaani seedhiyaan chadhi hai
 But for the total people, they have become divine incarnations
 unhone apni raajnneeti main jin chizon ko shaamil kiya he vah saamaajik or aarthik barabari kaa falaspha bhi he or rashtrawaad ke saath bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim kii apil bhi
 When Modi makes speeches and cremation statements in the speeches, a large part of the society gets a sense of being special and protected from the neglected
 modi sargical strike ke baad jis tarah se use desh kii asmita or sainikon ke sammaan ke saath pesh karte hai usase ek aam voter ko ehsaas hota he ki desh kii simaaon ko pehali baar surakshit karne kii pahal kii gai he
 Former generals told TV that the surgical strike was not the first time, but the manner in which the Prime Minister presented the army's actions in his statements and speeches gave a sense of 'self-respect' to the 'desperate' people for the first time
 narendra modi kai maamalon main apane virodhiyon ko peeche chhodte hai or lagata he ki unhen kai morchon par modi se kaaphi kuch siikhnaa he
 Akhilesh Yadav's statement that the votes are met by persuading the voter not to point to it
 yani modi apane votaron ko wo bharosa dilaa rahe hai jo ab tak unhen nahin mil paaya
 For example, farmers were also troubled by demonetisation, small businessmen as well as poor people
 kaam dhandhe chaupat huye or kai logon ko naukariyon se haath dhaana padaa
 Former finance minister and Congress leader p Chidambaram has said that the victory in UP and Uttarakhand cannot be called a referendum on demonetisation as you will have to consider the opposite in the other three states Punjab, Goa and Manipur
 phir bhi notebandi se hui tamaam dikkaton ke baad bhi log bijepi ko vot dete hai to ye maananaa hoga ki modi logon ke ye samajhane main safal huye ki unka ye kadam bhrashtachar, aatankwaad or kaale dhan ke khilaaf tha
 Every journalist reporting on the ground heard this from the mouth of the people - 'yes there is a problem but this step is in the interest of the country
 ’ yahaan mahatvapurn ye he ki ye kadam desh ke hi hit main nahin logon ko nijee hit main bhi laga he
 Modi told the people - 'they looted, i will return' and people realized that now they have become equal to the rich who deposited black money
 ye baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki bijepi ne kisi musalmaan ko upi main tikat nahin diya jaisaa ki usne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kiya tha
 The bjp's move may be for Hindu polarization, but Modi and Amit Shah's pair have presented it as a model of progressive politics
 upi ke chunaav main un siton par bijepi ne baari jeet hasil kii he jin siton par muslim bahul aabaadi thi
 The BJP has once again succeeded in areas with Jat population, and has also won a seat like Deoband
 tippaniyan Modi's ministers take his neuter forward
 isiliye vittamantri arun jetali huddang karne vaale abivipi ke chaatro par kisi tarah kaa kathor bayaan dene ke bajaay kehete hai ki bharat akelaa desh he jahaan rashtrawaad kii baat karnaa galat lagata he to amit shah congress, bispi or samaajawaadee party ke liye kasaab shabd kaa istemaal karne ke baad bhi kah pate hai ki log dharm or jati kii raajnneeti se ub gayi hai or wo vikaas chaahate hai
 That is, Narendra Modi has transformed the issue of Hindutva from his propaganda style into a war against pseudo-secularism and appeasement politics and now the credibility of all 'secular' parties will be the main strategy of BJP
 yahi nahin unhone notebandi jaise apane aarthik kadam ko jis tarah se sargical strike or rashtrawaad ke saath joda he vah ek aisa mishran he jo unhen desh ke tamaam hisson ke votaron ke bich lokapriy bana rahaa he
 Before dealing with this power, his opponents have to remember that Modi has acquired the image of Shiva's avatar
 modi pichley teen saalon main aam voter ke bich lokapriyata kii aasamaani seedhiyaan chadhi hai
 But for the total people, they have become divine incarnations
 unhone apni raajnneeti main jin chizon ko shaamil kiya he vah saamaajik or aarthik barabari kaa falaspha bhi he or rashtrawaad ke saath bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim kii apil bhi

 For example, farmers were also troubled by demonetisation, small businessmen as well as poor people
 kaam dhandhe chaupat huye or kai logon ko naukariyon se haath dhaana padaa
 Former finance minister and Congress leader p Chidambaram has said that the victory in UP and Uttarakhand cannot be called a referendum on demonetisation as you will have to consider the opposite in the other three states Punjab, Goa and Manipur
 phir bhi notebandi se hui tamaam dikkaton ke baad bhi log bijepi ko vot dete hai to ye maananaa hoga ki modi logon ke ye samajhane main safal huye ki unka ye kadam bhrashtachar, aatankwaad or kaale dhan ke khilaaf tha
 Every journalist reporting on the ground heard this from the mouth of the people - 'yes there is a problem but this step is in the interest of the country
 ’ yahaan mahatvapurn ye he ki ye kadam desh ke hi hit main nahin logon ko nijee hit main bhi laga he
 Modi told the people - 'they looted, i will return' and people realized that now they have become equal to the rich who deposited black money
 ye baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki bijepi ne kisi musalmaan ko upi main tikat nahin diya jaisaa ki usne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main kiya tha
 The bjp's move may be for Hindu polarization, but Modi and Amit Shah's pair have presented it as a model of progressive politics
 upi ke chunaav main un siton par bijepi ne baari jeet hasil kii he jin siton par muslim bahul aabaadi thi
 The BJP has once again succeeded in areas with Jat population, and has also won a seat like Deoband
 tippaniyan Modi's ministers take his neuter forward
 isiliye vittamantri arun jetali huddang karne vaale abivipi ke chaatro par kisi tarah kaa kathor bayaan dene ke bajaay kehete hai ki bharat akelaa desh he jahaan rashtrawaad kii baat karnaa galat lagata he to amit shah congress, bispi or samaajawaadee party ke liye kasaab shabd kaa istemaal karne ke baad bhi kah pate hai ki log dharm or jati kii raajnneeti se ub gayi hai or wo vikaas chaahate hai
 That is, Narendra Modi has transformed the issue of Hindutva from his propaganda style into a war against pseudo-secularism and appeasement politics and now the credibility of all 'secular' parties will be the main strategy of BJP
 yahi nahin unhone notebandi jaise apane aarthik kadam ko jis tarah se sargical strike or rashtrawaad ke saath joda he vah ek aisa mishran he jo unhen desh ke tamaam hisson ke votaron ke bich lokapriy bana rahaa he
 Before dealing with this power, his opponents have to remember that Modi has acquired the image of Shiva's avatar
 purv generalon ne tivi kaha ki sargical strike pehali baar nahin kii gai lekin pradhanmantri ne sena kii karrwai ko jis andaaz main apane bayanon or bhaashanon main pesh kiya usase ‘hataash’ logon ko pehali baar ‘atmasamman’ kaa bodh hua
 Narendra Modi beats his opponents in many cases and seems to have a lot to learn from Modi on many fronts
 akhilesh yadav kaa bayaan ki vot matadaata ko samajhane se nahin bahakaane se milte he isaki ore ishaara karata he
 That is, Modi is giving his voters the confidence that they have not got
 misaal ke taur par notebandi se kisaan bhi pareshaan huye, chote kaarobaari bhi or garib log bhi
 The work was destroyed and many people lost their jobs
 purv vittamantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki upi or uttarakhand main mili jeet notebandi par janamat sangrah nahin kaha ja saktaa kyonki baaki teen rajyon punjab, goa or manipur main phir aapako iske ulat maananaa hoga
 Even after all the problems caused by the ban on demonetisation, if people vote for the BJP, then it must be believed that Modi succeeded in convincing the people that his move was against corruption, terrorism and black money
 jamini reporting karne vaale har patrkaar ne logon ke munh se ye suna – ‘haa dikkat to he lekin desh ke hit main he ye kadam
 'it is important here that this step is not only in the interest of the country, but the people are also engaged in personal interest
 modi ne logon se kaha – ‘unhone lutaa, main lautaaungaa’ or logon ko ye mahasoos hua ki ab wo un amiron ke baraabar ho gayi hai jinhone kaala dhan jamaa kiya
 It is also to be noted that the BJP did not give any Muslim a ticket in UP as it did in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kaa kadam bhale hi hindu dhruvikaran ke liye ho lekin modi or amit shah kii jodi ne ise pragatisheel raajnneeti ke namoonay ko taur par pesh kiya he
 In the UP elections, the BJP has won a large number of seats which had a Muslim majority population
 jat bahul aabaadi vaale ilaakon main ek baar phir se bijepi kaamyaab hui he to usne devband jaisi seat bhi jiti he
 The comments modi ke mantri unke nerrative ko aage le jate hai
 That is why instead of making any harsh statement on the students of ABVP who are hoodwinks, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley says that India is the only country where it seems wrong to talk about nationalism, then Amit Shah uses the word Kasab for Congress, BSP and Samajwadi Party Even after that, people are able to say that people are bored of religion and caste politics and they want development
 yani narendra modi ne apni prachaar style se hindutv ke mudde ko chhadam secular vaad or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf jang main badla he or ab sari ‘secular’ partiyon kii vishwasaneeyata khatm karnaa bijepi kii pramukh ranneeti rahegi
 Not only this, the way he has associated his economic move like demonetisation with surgical strikes and nationalism is a mixture that is making him popular among the voters of all parts of the country
 is takat se nibatane se pehle unke virodhiyon ko yaad rakhana hoga ki modi shiv ke avatar vaali chhavi hasil kar chuke hai

 Marcus Stoinis also took three wickets after scoring a half-century, helping Kings XI Punjab beat Delhi Daredevils by nine runs in an Indian Premier League match here today

 punjab kii ore se stoinis ne gendbaaji main bhi kamaal dikhaate hue 40 ran dekar teen wicket chatkaaye
 Mohit Sharma spent just 21 runs in four overs bowling economically
 punjab kii nau maichon main yah teesri jeet he or uske chah ank ho gaye hai, lekin team antim sthaan par hi he
 After a second successive defeat in nine matches, Delhi are on 10 points from five wins, but remain in third place

 Vijay also hit a four off Maurice, but on the same ball from the same fast bowler, caught at deep midwicket to Kalres Brathwaite

 Saha opened the account with a four on Shami, while Stoinis hit the first six of the innings on Nadeem
 unhone tej gendbaaj brethwate par bhi chaukaa or chakka maaraa
 Stoinis completed the team's hundreds of runs in the 13th over with a single off leg-spinner Amit Mishra

 Bismillah Khan, the famous shehnai player who used to sing the melody of the shehnai in Indian classical music and culture, called the shehnai as his begum and music was his whole life for him
 patni ke intkaal ke baad shehanai hi unki begum or sangi-saathi donon thi, vahiin sangeet hameshaa hi unka puraa jivan rahaa
 Born in Dumrao, Bihar on March 21, 1916, Khan used to say that there are many parts of music and many raganis made from them
 sangeet apane aap main puraa jivan he
 An interesting incident is also associated with the name of Ustad Bismillah
 unka janm hone par unke dada rasul baksh khan ne unki taraf dekhte hue bismilla kaha
 After this, he was named Bismillah
 unka ek or naam cameruddin tha
 His ancestors were court musicians in Bhojpur Rajwada, Bihar
 unke pita pangbar khan isi pratha se judate hue dumrao riyasat ke maharaja keshav prasad singh ke darbar main shehanai vaadan kaa kaam karne lage
 At the age of six, Bismillah was taken to Benares
 yahaan unka sangeet prashikshan bhi shuru hua or ganga ke saath unka judaav bhi
 Khan began to learn the clarinet from his uncle Ali Baksh 'vilayatu' associated with the Kashi Vishwanath temple
 khan ko yaad karte hue sangeet shikshak or gayak pandit mohandev kehete hai, ‘khan dharm kii simaaon se pare saraswati ke bhakt the
 He often performed the clarinet in Hindu temples, the clarinet was the medium of worship of Allah and the worship of Saraswati
 apane sangeet ke madhyam se unhone shanti or prem kaa sandesh diya
 In a book 'sur Ki Baradari' written above Khan, writer Yatindra Mishra wrote, 'khan used to say that music is something in which caste is nothing
 sangeet kisi majahab kaa bura nahin chahta
 In the book, Mishra has also written about Khan's association with Banaras
 unhone likhaa he, ‘khan kehete the ki unki shehanai banaras kaa hissaa he
 He has been young while living in Mangalagouri and Pakka Mahal throughout his life, then the juice of Banaras will drip in his shehnai somewhere
 ’bharat kii aazaadee or khan kii shehanai kaa bhi khaas rishta rahaa he
 On the eve of independence in 1947, when the country's flag was unfurling on the Red Fort, his shehnai was also sharing the message of freedom there
 tab se lagbhag har saal 15 agast ko pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke baad bismilla kaa shehanai vaadan ek pratha ban gayi
 Khan fascinated people in different parts of the country and the world with the resonance of his shehnai
 apane jivan kaal main unhone iran, iraq, afghanistan, japan, america, canada or rus jaise alag-alag mulkon main apni shehanai kii jaadui dhune bikherin
 Khan also gave music in several films
 unhone kannada film ‘sannaadi apanna’, hindi film ‘gunj uthi shehanai’ or sathyajith re kii film ‘jalsaghar’ ke liye shehanai kii dhune chhedi
 The last time he played the melodious tone of shehnai in the song 'yeh jo desh hai tera' from Ashutosh Gowariker's Hindi film Swadesh
 khan ke sangeet ke safar ko yaad karte hue pandit mohandev kehete hai ki bharat ratna, padmashri, padmabhushan, padmavibhushan jaise alankaaron or puraskaron se sammanit bismilla khan kaa sangeet unke duniya se jane ke baad bhi amar he
 Bismillah Khan has made a point for himself that whenever the name of the shehnai is taken, his name comes first
 ek tarah se shehanai or bismilla ek duusare ke paryaay ban chuke hai

 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, four ministers of the Yogi government fielded, out of which three ministers have managed to win
 inamen do brahman or ek dalit cheharaa he
 In such a situation, will Yogi's minister be able to make a place in Modi's cabinet? In this Lok Sabha election, Rita Bahuguna Joshi has been elected as an MP from Allahabad and Satyadev Pachauri has been elected from Kanpur and SP Singh Baghel has become a Member of Parliament from Agra
 jabaki ambedkarnagar seat se bijepi ummidavaar mukut bihari verma ko haar mili he
 Varma was the only minister in the Yogi government who had to face defeat
 yogi sarkaar ke teen mantri saansad bane hai, jinamein se do mantri pad se daavedaar bataae ja rahe hai

 After this, Firozabad was contesting from the seat, but lost to Akshay Yadav

 isliye koun mantri banegaa nahin banegaa is par main kuch nahin kah saktaa or naa hi meraa isapar kuch kahana thik hoga
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi was seen surviving on the question of becoming a minister in the Modi cabinet
 jabaki satyadev pachori ne kaha ki vah ek kaaryakarta jaise hai or kaaryakarta ke rup main unhen jo bhi jimmedaari milti he unhone kiya he aage bhi jo jimmedaari milegi vah karenge
 This is the first time that the impact of the Prime Minister's talk is visible on the elected mps, everyone is avoiding the question of becoming a minister

 in sanghathanon ne sawaal khadaa kiya ki modi ne 'mek in india' abhiyaan kaa elaan to kar diya, lekin audyogic ikaayiyon main suraksha ke paryaapt intjaam kii shart nahin rakhi he
 In such a situation, should it be assumed that the Modi government is inviting foreign capitalists to 'make in more land in India'? Against the struggling organizations like Pension Bhogi Sangharsh Morcha, Bhopal Group for Information and Action, Children against dow-carbide Fund and workers were present
 bhopal group for information and ection ke satinath shadangi ne bataaya ki america daao chemicals company ne somvaar ko hui sunwaayee ke dauraan duusari baar adaalat ke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii
 The weakness of the Indian government and the support given by the US government to the delinquent companies is responsible for this
 sanghathanon ne bataaya ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi or america raashtrapati baraak obama ko chitthee likhakar daao chemicals ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kii he
 Organizations reported that the management of the Union Carbide plant was charged with serious culpable homicide, including culpable homicide, for the 1984 accident, but the management of the company has been ignoring the orders of the Bhopal district court since 1992
 bhopal ke mukhya nyaayik dandadhikari ne daao chemicals ko notice bhejkar aadeshit kiya tha ki vah adaalat main hajir hokar yah bataae ki apane kisi pratinidhi ko adaalat main pesh kyon nahin karti
 According to the organizations, under the Mutual Legal Assistants Treaty on Dow Chemical, notices have been served twice in collaboration with the US Ministry of Home and Justice, but the company continues to defy court notices
 sanghathanon kaa aarope he ki is america company dwaara bharat main chah se zyada shakhaon ke jariye vyapaar kiya ja rahaa he, iske baavjood bhopal jila adaalat ke aadesh ko na manavaa paanaa bharat sarkaar kii vifaltaa ko darshata he
 He said that the government's continued failure in this matter is a dangerous signal for the 'make in India' campaign recently announced by Prime Minister Modi
 shadangi ne aage kaha ki pradhanmantri modi america gaye, america raashtrapati bharat bhi aae, magar unhone bhopal gas traasadee kaa masalaa nahin uthaaya
 Not only this, Modi also met Adro Livasin, head of Dow Chemicals, but did not discuss the issue
 yah samvedanheenata nahin to or kya he? unhone kaha ki gas traasadee main hajaaron logon kii maut dekhne ke baavjood modi desh main america companiyon ko bina shart aamantrit kar rahe hai
 American companies will come here too, but the workers here need to be careful and alert
 shadangi ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar ne gas traasadee maamle kii har din sunwaayee karaane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin us par amal nahin ho rahaa he
 Leave aside the talk of Americans in the last four years, the case of increasing the sentence of Indian accused has not even progressed further
 input: IANS England captain Alastair Cook expressed surprise at the manner in which his team managed to win the series 3–1 after returning to the Lords for three consecutive Tests
 bhartiya team ovel main teen din se bhi kam samay main paanchaven or antim test main pari or 244 ran se haar gayi

 a day after he was removed from the post of chairman of the organizing committee, Kalmadi on Tuesday adopted a rebel stance saying that only the Indian Olympic Association has the power to remove him as the same association has appointed him to this post
 kalmadi ne kaha ki vah virodhswaroop mukhya kaaryakari adhikari jaranel singh ko aayojan samiti ke adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar saunpege, jaisaa ki khel mantri dwaara karne ke liye kaha gaya he

 Kalmadi also opposed the reason given by the Sports Ministry for removing them, stating that they were being removed so as to ensure a 'fair' investigation into the alleged corruption in the Commonwealth Games
 kalmadi ne daawa kiya ki unhone or aayojan samiti ke adhikariyon ne vibhinn jaanch agenciyon ke saath sahyog kiya he
 The sports administrator said, 'first of all it is necessary for me to say that i have given all possible support to all the investigating agencies including CBI

 Kalmadi said that according to the 'host city' contract for the Commonwealth Games, the organizing committee was formed by the IOA and hence the Sports Ministry does not have the power to legally remove them
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main jarur kahana chahta hum ki sanstha panjikaran adhinium ke tahat aayojan samiti ek swytt sanstha he
 As the president of the institution, i can only be removed under the constitutional documents of the institution
 ’kalmadi ne kaha, ‘24 janvari 2011 ke aadesh jari nahin kiya janaa chaiye tha kyonki yah bina kshetradhikaar ke jari kiya gaya he
 The order has been issued in response to a quick response to a controversy created by a section of the media

 Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has said that the remarks made about Swami Vivekananda in front of BJP president Nitin Gadkari have created the same situation as LK Advani was born to Jinnah as secular
 us samay adwani ko party adhyaksh pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 Thackeray, however, defended Gadkari only last month from the congress-ncp government in Maharashtra for illegal gains in land allocation
 shivasena ke mukhpatr ‘saamana’ main likhe sampadakeey main party pramukh bal thakare ne kaha, ‘adwani ne jinna par kii gai tippanee ke baad apana aadhaar kho diya or gadakari ko swami vivekanand par kii gai tippanee se upje vivaad ke baad jhatka laga he
 "he said," Gadkari clarified that he did not match Swami Vivekananda and Dawood, but not a single leader of his party could speak on his behalf
 ’thakare ne likhaa, ‘gadakari bhi sanshay main honge ki swami vivekanand or daaud ibrahim ke aikyuu se judi tippanee ko lekar aresas unka saath degaa yaa nahin
 'it was written in the editorial,' Gadkari's condition has become like that saying, all the companions of happiness are not in sorrow
 ’adwani ne 2005 main pakistan kii apni yatra ke dauraan mohammad ali jinna ko ‘dharmanirpeksh’ kaha tha or usase bharat main paidaa hue vivaad ke baad unhen bhaajapa ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The Sangh also objected to Gadkari's statement on Swami Vivekananda
 sangh ke pravaktaa ram madhav ne kaha tha, ‘swami vivekanand jaise log duniya bhar main kaaphi sammaan kii drushti se dekhe jate hai
 So when we talk about them
 hamen yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki unase lakhon logon kii bhaavana judi huyi he or hamen is bare main satark rahanaa hoga

 periods ke dauraan galati se bhi na karen ye paanch kamperiods kaa lebar pen se ye he naathaek australian vimens website main chhapi ek report ke mutabik, periods main hone vaale dard se lebar pen kaa andaaza lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Dr
 Dasha Fielder told the website, 'periods and delivery pains are the same in a few moments of the beginning
 fark bas itnaa he ki periods main dard utana hi rahata he jitna ki shuruyaat main par prasav main wo dard badhata jaataa he'
 Pain is 10 times more in childbirth, there is a simple connection between the pain of periods and pain of labor
 prasav ke dauraan servix kaa muh 1 centimetre khulata he lekin prasav ke dauraan servix kaa muh 10 centimetre tak khul jaataa he jisase baccha aasaani se baahar aa sake
 You will not know these things related to periods, more pain in periods is worrying, this girls will be very happy with this news, who do not have much pain during periods because they are told that the chances of pain in labor in future are also less
 Huh
 haalanki jin ladkiya ko zyada dard hota he, is report ke mutabik unhen lebar pen main bhi kai guna adhik dard sahanaa pad saktaa he

 As such, Kim Jong cannot kill Parinda without her permission in North Korea
 patta bhi vahaan is taanashaah se puch kar hilta he
 But about five and a half million feet above is an eye that has seen Kim's Korea
 or jo dekha he wo yakeen maniye bahut daraavna he
 Because the intention that this dictator is sitting in his chest
 agar wo usne puri kar lee to duniya rahane ke kaabil nahin bachegi
 And millions of people will be destroyed in an instant
 kyonki is baar uski taiyaari nai qayamat kii he
 There can be chaos, no one can enter Kimmasandar
 zamin se uskejalladakisi ko aane nahin denge
 It is impossible to kill Parinde from the sky
 is dharti ke ek kone main yahi wo jagah he
 Which is cut off from the whole world
 magar phir bhi puri duniya chaahakar bhi isse cat nahin sakati
 Because the sultanate here operates
 uske aage kisi kii nahin chalati
 There is only one way to get shelter from him
 ki uski gali jaao hi nahin
 And if you go, then he has all those things of panic that can come to your doorstep and create a furore
 america ne himmat dikhaai uttari korea ke is ziddi taanashaah kii zidd todane kii
 Because even an open bull is not left in the society
 ye to phir bhi wo he jo 5-5 parmaanu hathiyaar or hidrogen bam liye baitha he
 And is in preparation for the sixth
 or agar aisa hua to yakeen maniye khayr kisi kii nahin hogi
 The dictator has made complete preparations for the destruction Some pictures have come from the satellite about five and a half million feet above the ground
 north korea ke us panjai-ri site kii jo ye bataane ke liye kaaphi hai ki ek or tabaahi kii taiyaari puri ho chuki he
 And that catastrophe can be tested anytime
 or agar aisa hua to is taanashaah ke hathiyaaron ke zakhire main ek or parmaanu bam aa jayega
 Then it will be dreadful and dreadful
 aise main america kaa dabaav badha to yuddh to hoga hi
 But the devastation will be such that it is also difficult to guess
 satellite tasveeron ne kholaa raaj2006 ke baad se lekar ab tak north korea kaa ye taanashaah 5-5 newclear test pehle hi kar chukaa he
 On April 12, satellite images of the North Korea's Panjai-ri nuclear test site have noted a strong movement around the North Portal
 itnaa hi nahin site ke cmand centre ke paas kai adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko bhi dekha gaya he
 About 11 equipment or supplies have been kept in the same center command area
 jo ki yahaan kaam karne waalon logon ke group ke chalane kii tasviir ho sakati he
 After these pictures came to light, US President Donald Trump has made it clear that the possibility of any military action to stop Korea on its nuclear or ballistic missile programs cannot be ruled out
 or ehitayatan jab america ne korea proydweep main apana strike group bheja to ye sanakee taanashaah bhadak uthaa or halaat ab yahaan yuddh ke banate ja rahe hai
 The impact of the devastation will be far away
 Now the matter is serious
 jang kaa khatra sir uthaane laga he
 The war between North Korea and the United States can begin at any time
 aise main zaruri ho jaataa he ki ham ye jaan len ki agar aisa hua to tabaahi kii aanch kahaan tak pahonchegi
 Is this the call of world war? kyonki ek taraf arab desh to duusari taraf korian peninsula jang ke jwalamukhi par baitha he
 On top of this, the US is leaving no stone unturned to give the North Korean dictator a chance
 ab kahin jang chhid hai to andaja lagaaie ki phir kya hoga?mixilon kaa rukh america kii tarafaye sach he ki ghabrahat sab main he
 Nobody is leisurely
 halaat hi ab kuch aise hai
 South Korea on one side
 america, japan or china apane apane hathiyaaron se las hai
 Just waiting for the bugle to blow
 to duusari taraf maidan main akelaa khadaa north korea kaa taanashaah is baat ko lekar kashmakash main he ki wo apni mixilon kaa ruukh kis ore kare
 Therefore, he has decided that his missiles will have only one side of the attack from anywhere
 or wo he america
 This North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has a valid reason for this
 kyonki syria par hamale ke baad ab america kaa ravaiyya puri tarah se jang kaa ho gaya he
 That is why he has sent his warships to Korean Peninsula
 lihaaza kim jong un ne america ko aakhri chetavanee di he ki jang ke liye taiyaar rahen
 If you want to understand this annoyance of Kim Jong on your own, then understand this map first
 kyonki iske baad tasviir zyaada saafe ho jaaegi
 Even though the distance of America from here is about 10 thousand kilometers, but the border of South Korea is connected to it
 america ke duusare saathi japan kii duuri mahaz ek hazaar kilometre he
 Relations with China are not much better
 kyonki kim jong kii zahreeli mixilon se khauf use bhi he
 Russia is the only country in its neighborhood of Le de with whom it has had a friendly relationship with the communists
 magar maujuuda vakt main halaat aise hai ki uttar korea khud ko akelaa hi samajhataa he
 On his own, he is not only ready to take the iron from America, but is also filling the battle of equality
 trump sarkaar bhi taiyardusri taraf america kii trump sarkaar bhi puri taiyaari kiye baithi he
 It has sent its strike groups on the Korean peninsula
 jisamen nimitz class aircraft bhi he
 The USS Carl Vinson also includes two missile destroyers and a guided missile cruiser in addition to a carrier wing
 ab zaahir he north korea kii choukhat ke itane nazadik aakar america agar apni takat dikhayega to kim bhi chup baithne waalon main se to he nahin
 Hence the war of words has started before the war of arms
 narthkoriaka kahana he ki america kaa jahaaz bhejne kaa faisla jaldbaazi main uthaaya gaya kadam he
 He is trying to penetrate our borders
 agar america jang chahta he to democratic pipuls republic of korea (north korea) iske liye taiyaar he
 The case of China, immediately after the attack on Dandadolesiriya, Donald Trump's spirits have increased significantly
 isliye trump administration ke korian peninsula main jangi jahaaj bhejne ke is faisle ko kim jong-un ke liye final warning mana ja rahaa he
 However, Trump has also told his advisors that if Pyongyang adopts a soft approach, they may consider other options
 magar maujuuda halaat dekhakar aisa lagata to nahin hai
 On the other hand, the case of China on the attack on North Korea is also seen as disastrous
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki china ko kim se khatra to he magar itnaa bhi nahin ki wo america ke saath khadaa ho jaae
 America is also understanding, so it has also said that if China does not support, then it alone will take action against North Korea
 north korea ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahinhaalanki america ke liye north korea par hamalaa karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga kyonki wo jaanata he ki duniya ke is sabase sanakee taanashaah ke paas kai aisi misile hai jo america tak newclear dhamaakaa karne kii salaahiyat rakhti hai
 On the occasion of the 105th anniversary of his grandfather Kim Sang, who founded North Korea, there is a possibility that he may do the sixth nuclear test
 aise main agar jang ke halaat banate hai ki to ye kaha ja saktaa he ki america kaa to pataa nahin magar uttar korea ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he
 The winter season has come and it has the highest number of cold cases
 isamen lagaataar chhinken aane kii vajah se sirdard or badan dard bana rahata he
 From monsoon to winter, people fall prey to it many times
 kya aap jaanate hai zukam kii vajah banane vaale cold virus kareeb 200 kism ke hote hai
 Often people use common medicines to get rid of it
 is avasthaa main pehle 24 ghante kaaphi nirnaayak hote hai
 Virologist Professor John Oxford of Queen Mary University of London talks about its initial stage and ways to get rid of it
 professor oxford ne bataaya, 'zukam kaa kaaran banane vaale ye virus kabhi bhi or kahin bhi aapako gher sakate hai
 You might not have guessed, but once inhaled, more than 10,000 viruses can invite
 lekin inamen se kareeb 100 hi aise hote hai jo naak or gale ke apithelion cells par waar karte hai
 To avoid these, you have to take care of many special things
 'kaise paaen raahat- visheshgyon kaa daawa he ki shahad or neembu kaa mishran zukam main raahat dene main kaaphi madadgaar he
 - Wash hands thoroughly with soap before doing any work
 kisi bhi peedit vyakti ke sampark main aane se bachein
 According to an AUS study conducted in 2000, chicken soup is considered the best food in this condition
 ye zukam main jald se jald raahat dene main kargar he

 During the period of the relationship, the bench said that the situation can be considered under Section 2 (f) of the anti-domestic Violence Act and the nature of the relationship can be decided according to each case and situation
 ucchtam nyaayalay kii peeth ne kaha ki gharelu intjaam, kai gharelu jimmedaariyon ko nibhaana masalan safai, khaanaa bananaa, ghar kii dekharekh karnaa sambandh ke vivaah ke swaroop main hone ke sanket dete hai

 Therefore Farooqui argued that if Mir is to be criticized, then Mir needs to be read fully

 ajtak kii team ne jab ajay dutt or prakaash jarwal ke alaava dilli ke kai ilaakon kaa jayja liya or paaya ki vahaan halaat behad gambhir hai or sarkaar va adhikariyon ke jhagade ke baad halaat or kharaab ho gaye hai
 Ambedkar Nagar Ambedkar Nagar received mixed response from people regarding the distribution of ration
 is kshetra main kuch log santusht dikhe, to vahiin kuch ilaakon main maheenon se kai pariwaron ko rashan nahin mila
 Girdhari, who runs a government ration shop here, says, 'there is no problem in giving ration
 samasya pioes mashin kii he, kabhi-kabhi bujurgon ke finger print match nahin karte, aise main unako ham aadhaar card or pan card dekh kar rashan dete hai, par sarkaar ko hamaare bare main sochna chahie
 They are going to reduce the rate and ration in the coming days
 hamaara kharchaa nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya he, aage to or bhi bura haal hoga
 'devlidillika Deoli region is already backward in many ways from other parts of the capital
 yahaan zyaadaatar rashan kii dukaan band hi mili
 People told that they get ration till the 10th of the month, after that shopkeepers close shops, saying there is no ration
 yahaan kareeb 50 saal se rah rahe ram ji ne bataaya, 'itane varsh main yahaan kuch nahin badla
 We live in the capital of the country to say, but there is neither sanitation nor other facilities here
 zyaadaatar logon ko rashan miltaa hi nahin he
 After hours in line, it is revealed that the thumb is not matching
 bahut bura haal he, aakhir ye kiski galati he? kyon pioes mashin kharaab padati he, hamaara haq hamase kyon chhina ja rahaa he iskaa jimmedaar koun he?'sangam viharasangam vihaar main halaat or bhi kharaab hai
 Atul, who runs a ration shop, said that all shopkeepers are accused, but the government gives ration to shopkeepers in limited quantity
 pioes mashin ke bare atul ne bataaya ki ye mashin bina lite ke chalati nahin, lite ho to network nahin hota, log subah se shaam line main lagate hai or lite nahin aane se khaali haath waapas laut jate hai
 Whether the people of the area or the shopkeepers of the government ration all have their own problems, no solution can be found
 aise main sawaal ye he ki jab rajdhani main ye halaat hai to duusare rajyon main kya sthiti hogi
