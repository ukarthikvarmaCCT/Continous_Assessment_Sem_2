 Are you ready for JEE entrance? Now this exam is left just a few days
 jeii desh kii pratishthit parikshaon main se ek he
 For better preparation, Motion IIT Managing Director Nitin Vijay has told us some tips, which can help you get the best results in JEE Entrance Examination
 1
 Online vs Offline Mode: Now in JEE entrance, students are given the option of online or offline examination
 ofline paaramparik tarika he or online exam dene main sahajata mahasoos nahin karne kii sthiti main yah chaatro kii pradarshan kshamta par koi bandish nahin lagaataa he
 Many students, under pressure, make the mistake of taking the option of online
 jabaki budhimaani isamen hai ki pehle aap apni kshamta or yogyata ko anken, donon vikalpon ke bare main apni shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kar akalan karen or phir nirnay len
 2
 speed:jeii entrens main safalataa kaaphi had tak time management par nirbhar karti he
 If you are giving the test online, then check the system you have got, make sure that there are no technical problems and slow processing in the system
 ofline exam main bhi samay kaa puraa dhyaan rakhana hoga
 It is better to keep the watch in such a place where you can easily see the time
 lekin aisa bhi na ho ki aapkaa puraa dhyaan ghadi par hi rahe or aap samay ko lekar tanaav va chintaa main pad kar galati kar baithen
 3
 padhein or samajhen:jaise hi prashnptr aapke haath main yaa computer screen par aae, dhyaan se har nirdesh ko pard kar samaj len
 Instead of starting solving questions immediately, first take a look at all the questions
 4
 Do not panic: It is common for students who are under pressure to take exams to get stressed or nervous in the exam hall
 khud ko shant rakhte hue kaam karen
 Taking stress will negatively affect the end result and disappointment will be at hand

 pashchim uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko muslim voton main bikharaav kaa dar sata rahaa he
 This is the reason that at the joint rally of Deoband in Saharanpur, BSP President Mayawati repeatedly warned the Muslims not to let their vote be divided in any case
 congress is laayak nahin he ki wo bijepi ko takkar de sake, jabaki mahagathbandhan ke paas majboot aadhaar he
 In such a situation, do not scatter your votes and vote in favor of a coalition candidate
 mayawati ne kaha ki pashchim upi ke saharanpur, meerut or bareli mandal main muslim samaaj kii aabaadi kaaphi zyada hai
 In such a situation, the Muslim society has to say that Congress is not fit to compete with the BJP
 ye baat congress ko bhi pataa he, lekin vah ye maanakar chal rahi he ki congress na jite to gathbandhan bhi na jite
 Do not let such dreams succeed
 basapa supremeo ne kaha ki saharanpur seat par basapa ne bahut pehle hi apane ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan kar diya tha
 While no candidate was named finalist from Congress
 aise main congress ne jab dekha ki basapa ummidavaar muslim he to unhone bhi muslim utaar diya he
 Congress has no other vote in Saharanpur
 jabaki basapa kaa apana base vot he
 Now the Jat vote is also with us along with SP
 aise main muslim kisi bhi bahekaave main aakar apane vot ko na bantane den, balki balki basapa ummidavaar haji fajalurrhaan ke paksh main vot karen
 Mayawati said that if the BJP is to be defeated, there is a one-sided appeal to the Muslim community, to unite and vote in favor of the coalition
 abhi modi ke saath hi yogi ko bhi bhagaanaa hoga taaki bijepi kii jativaadee or sampradayik raajnneeti se mukti mil sake
 Let us know that Muslim voters are in decisive role in many Lok Sabha seats of West UP
 yahi vajah he ki basapa ne kai loksabhaa siton par muslim ummidavaaron par daanv lagaaya he
 Among these, the BSP has fielded Muslim candidates in Saharanpur, Meerut and Amroha in western UP
 vahiin, sapa ne kairana, muradabad, sanbhal or rampur seat par muslim candidet utaara he
 Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Bijnor, Amroha, Bulandshahr and Moradabad are the districts where Muslim voters are in a decisive role
 aise main gathbandhan ke muslim ummidavaar maidan main hai, jahaan dalit muslim voter ekasaath aate hai vahaan bijepi kii jeet kaa sameekaran gadabada saktaa he
 Muslims are 26 in Kairana seat, 31 in Meerut seat, 20 in Baghpat seat, 31 in Muzaffarnagar seat, 38 in Saharanpur seat, 19 in Ghaziabad seat and about 38% in Bijnor seat
 jabaki gautamabuddhanagar seat par 14 fisadi muslim matadaata hai
 This clearly shows that the Muslim vote is in an important role in all the seats in the first phase, where Saharanpur has the highest number of Muslim voters
 gauratlab he 2014 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main basapa ne badi sankhya main muslim pratyaashee utaare the

 aise main muslim matadaata teenon partiyon ke bich bant gaya tha, jiskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko mila tha
 This is the reason that Mayawati is warning Muslim votes this time

 Rahul Gandhi while talking to businessmen in Karnataka has once again challenged the economic policies of the Modi government
 rahul ne kaha ki endie sarkaar desh main naukari ke sanshaadhan paidaa karne main puri taraf se vifal rahi he
 Although Rahul admitted that the pace of creating new jobs was very slow even during the tenure of the UPA government, but according to him, the Modi government has broken all records of failure in this field
 jumala sabit hua lakhon naukari kaa waadarahul gandhi ne kaha ki jahaan padosi desh china ek din main 50 hajaar naukariyaan paidaa kar rahaa he vahiin modi sarkaar ek din main mahaj 400 naukariyaan hi de paane main samarth he
 Rahul Gandhi said that the Modi government took charge at a time when the Indian economy was very strong in terms of economic growth, so not being able to create a new job at such a time makes the government's failure more serious
 sangh leti he aarthik faisle?rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi apane aarthik faislon ke liye aresas jaisi sansthaaon par nirbhar hai or iskaa khamiyaja desh ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 Rahul claimed that on the advice of RSS, the Modi government decided to ban demonetisation so that a way to turn black money white would be found
 lihaaja, notebandi se sirf desh main kaledhan ko kinare lagane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Manmohan's advice on GST not accepted? While terming the GST decision by the Modi government once again as Gabbar Singh tax, Rahul explained to businessmen in Karnataka why he favors GST
 rahul ne daawa kiya ki jiesti lagu hone se pehle congress party kii taraf se purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne vitt mantri arun jetali se baat kii thi
 In this conversation, Manmohan Singh had asked Jaitley to run a pilot project before implementing GST so that new tax rules can be tested
 lekin parv pradhanmantri or arthshaastri singh ke is suzav ko jetali ne najadrandaaj karte hue jawaab diya ki pradhanmantri modi jiesti lagu karne kaa faisla le chuke hai
 Read this: Demonetisation-ending GST effect? With these figures, will the Congress government change the GST in 2019, indicating 'good days'? GST should be levied
 lekin modi sarkaar ne 5 tear jiesti lagaate hue desh main kaarobaar karnaa behad kathin kar diya
 Rahul promised the businessmen that if the Congress returns to power at the Center in 2019, it can take tough decisions to fix GST
 fail ho gai modi kii videsh niti?rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar kii videsh niti ko vifal qaraar dete hue kaha ki maujuuda samay main desh kaa sabhi padosi deshon se rishta behad kharaab ho chukaa he
 Whereas the government should have tried to normalize relations with neighboring countries to further strengthen itself globally
 iskaa nateeja aaj hamaare saamne he
 China has succeeded in building a special relationship with all the neighboring countries of the country
 rahul ne kaha ki sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagata he ki rus jaisaa desh jo hameshaa se bharat kaa sabase kareebi dost rahaa he vah bhi aaj pakistan ke saath majboot rishta banane kii kavayad main laga safal ho rahaa he
 Read this: We kept looking and 50 years ahead of 'new India', why 'new China' weakened defense budget? On the defense budget of the central government, Rahul said that today countries like China and Russia, including the US, doubled the defense budget And doing triplets
 yah kadam vah antarrashtriya halaat ko dekhte hue uthaa rahe hai
 But India has not acted to strengthen its defense budget, being ignorant of the international environment

 isi vajah se main unase vinamrata ke saath kehane ja rahaa hum
 He said that he will use this opportunity to exchange ideas on subjects which have worried India for the last 18 months

 We are the controllers of the attack, the conductors, so we need to know what action they will take against them
 in vishyon ko hameshaa ke liye nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Someone has to solve these issues at some time or the other
 unhone kaha ki vah jammu kashmir seemaa par ghuspaith jaise muddon or ghuspaith kar aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main pakistaniyon ke shaamil hone ke mudde ko bhi uthaayenge
 Asked if he would ask for voice samples of the Mumbai attack operators, Chidambaram said that he could certainly give voice samples of the operators
 ab, yah sabhi log sweekaar kar rahe hai ki mumbai hamalon ke sanchaalak pakistan main hai
 We think we know who the operators are
 nishchit taur par ve hamen aawaaj ke namoonay de sakate hai
 We also have their voice recording
 yah puche jane par ki kya pakistan ne kabhi aawaaj ke namoonay ko dene se inkaar bhi kiya he, chidambaram ne bataaya ki pakistan kii ore se saunpe gayi ek dastavej main bataaya gaya tha ki do logon ne apni aawaaj ke namoonay dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Asked if India would accept the submission of voice samples by Pakistan to a third country, Chidambaram said, "I once suggested that we don't give it to us
" ise kisi tisare desh ko dijie, taaki kisi tisare mulk main isaki forencik jaanch ho sake
 Asked if Pakistani military personnel were involved in the conduct of the Mumbai attacks, Chidambaram said that if you are referring to the document then you are giving the correct reference but i do not know whether they are real names or fictitious names
 
 yah puche jane par ki kya hamale ke sanchaalkon main pakistani sena ke do major shaamil hai, grahamantri ne kaha ki aisa dastavej main kaha gaya he
 He said about raising the issue of Headley being connected to the Mumbai attacks, that he would not raise it directly
 pakistan kii aatankwaad virdohi adaalat ne purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko somvaar ko bhagauda ghoshit kar diya
 This was done due to his not cooperating in the investigation of the assassination of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto
 'online' news agency ke anusaar rawalpindi main nyaayamurti rana nisaar ahamed kii adaalat ne sangheey jaanch agency ke anurodh par musharraf ko bhagauda ghoshit kiya
 The court proceedings took place in Adiala Jail for security reasons
 abhiyojkon ne kaha ki ve adaalat dwaara musharraf ke khilaaf jari warrant unhen nahin pahunchaa paa rahe hai
 Musharraf has been living in self-exile in the UK since 2009
 lekin britain se pakistan kii pratyrpan sandhi nahin hone ke kaaran british prashasan se unhen warrant musharraf tak pahunchane main sahyog nahin mila
 After the hearing, the court said that Musharraf's advertisement as a fugitive would be published in newspapers
 prashasan ko purv raashtrapati kii sampatti jabt karne kaa adhikaar bhi hoga
 The case against the five accused in the 2007 Bhutto assassination is pending because Musharraf refused to cooperate with investigators
 abhiyojkon ne adaalat main musharraf kaa ek saakshaatkaar bhi dikhaaya, jisamen unhen pakistan main chal rahe mukademe ke bare main jaankaree hone kii baat kahi gai he
 At the same time, according to 'geo News', the spokesman of Musharraf's party All Pakistan Muslim League, Fawad Chaudhary, reacted to the court's decision that this is being done to prevent his leader from returning to the country
 lekin vah apane sankalp se peeche hatane vaale nahin hai
 Earlier in February, a Rawalpindi court issued an arrest warrant against Musharraf after investigators declared him 'absconding'
 jaanchakartaaon kaa aarope he ki swa-nirvaasan ke baad 2007 main pakistan lautne vaali bhutto ko tatkaaleen musharraf sarkaar ne paryaapt suraksha nahin muhaiyaa karai, jisaki vajah se usee saal 27 disambar ko aatmghaatee bam hamale main unki maut ho gai

 However, it was also surprising that Indu Malhotra, the lone woman judge on the bench, opposed the decision saying that the court should not take a decision on religious practices
 haalanki, is faisle ne bhagwaan ayappa ke paramparaagat bhakton main naaraazgi paidaa kar di, jo faisla aane ke baad se hi iske khilaaf aakrosh vyakt kar rahe hai or is baat par adig hai ki ve mandir kii parampara ko nahin tuutane denge

 Because delayed investment in resolution of disputes discourages

 BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agarwal said that the state government has imposed section 144, so we welcome it, what the ministers of the Congress government are saying has no meaning because they do not care what they are doing and what they are saying

 The couple says they are waiting for when Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who took notice on a tweet by comedian Kapil Sharma, takes note of his agony
 ghar dilaane ke naam par 14 lakh rupee hadpesubhash mahapatra or unki patni shalamali mahapatra ne mumbai main apane ghar kaa sapana dekha
 For this, he collected 14 lakh rupees for his lifetime earnings, selling home jewelry, ancestral land in the village and taking loans from close people
 ye raashi makaan dilaane ke naam par unase ek brokar samet teen logon ne hadap lee
 According to Subhash Mahapatra, he is not very educated, so he was cheated through fake documents
 subhash restro-baar main mujisian ke taur par ghaki kaa guzaara chalaate the
 But these days this channel is also missing from them
 beete 175 din se unka roj kaa routine he, aaazaad maidan par aakar din bhar dharne par baithe rahanaa
 Going to jail in an attempt to commit self-immolation, Subhash Mahapatra says that he took his complaint from the police to the Chief Minister but nothing was found except for the assurances
 subhash mahapatra ke mutabik jab maharashtra main sarkaar badali to unhen bahut ummid thi ki mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis unki baat sunenge
 But even from there, he still got frustrated
 jab sab taraf se ummid tut gai to is vruddh jode ne mukhyamantri awaas ke baahar aatmadah karne kii koshish kii
 But from there he was caught and sent to jail
 is vruddh jode kaa kahana he ki unke paas jo kuch bhi tha sab khatm ho gaya he
 Now we have to see who comes forward to bring them justice
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 First my entry scene was to be shot there, but the Jat boys from Haryana created such a fuss that we had to run away from there by covering our bags

 However, Director Navdeep also asked one of those rowdy youths, why are you doing this? So he replied, 'sir, there is very little shooting in our Haryana

 We have lost a decade, we have to start afresh
 jab atal bihari vaajapeyi hate to vruddhi dar 8
 4 percent which was now reduced to 4

 Bollywood's famous director Ram Gopal Verma tweeted on Tuesday after an air strike in Balakot by the Indian Air Force
 deshavaasiyon kii tarah unamem bhi gussa dikhaai diya or apane ofishyal twitor acount par likhaa, 'i pakistan, agar tum ek maaroge to ham chaar maarenge
 'ram Gopal Varma has always been making his statements about the country through social media
 bollywood ko 'rangila', 'satya', 'company' or 'sarkaar' jaisi hit filmein dene vaale diarector ram gopal verma aksar apni filmon ke chalate kam or apane vivaadit twit or soshal media posts ke chalate charchaa main rahete hai
 Aey Pakistan, Agar tum ek maara tho hum char maarenge On Tuesday, many Bollywood actors also responded by tweeting
 salmaan khan (salman Khan) ne aatanki campon (terrorist Camp) par vayusena kii karrwai ke baad twit kiya tha
 He wrote, "hail, Indian Air Force
 " salmaan khan ke is twit par log pratikriyaayein bhi de rahe hai
 Before Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar had tweeted and said, 'enter and kill'
 to vahiin chetan bhagat ne kaha ki hamen thappad maaroge to ham collar pakadakar maarenge
 Since the Pulwama attack, there was anger all over India and people wanted to see retaliation
 vayusena kii is karrwai ke baad logon main khushi kaa maahaul he
 Let me tell you that this operation of the Indian Air Force was completely successful
 bhartiya sena ne aatanki campon par hamale ke liye kareeb 1000 kilo bam kaa istemaal kiya or aatanki campon ko puri tarah se tabah kar diya
 Within just two weeks of taking the revenge of the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force has demonstrated its bravery in a blistering manner
 bataa den ki bhartiya vayusena (indian airforce) ke 12 miraj vimaanon ne elosi paar jaakar jaish-e-mohammad (jaish-e-mohammed) ke aatanki campon (terrorist Camp) ko dhwast kiya he
 You can agree or disagree with the government but the economy will not be sluggish
 mana ki sarkaar ne tex (jiesti) thopane main koi muravvat nahin kii phir bhi dhahati arthvyavastha kii madad kii khatir ab shopping bag uthaanaa hi padegaa
 Economic growth rate collapses after demonetisation! When governments consider themselves almighty, there are accidents like demonetisation
 jidipi yani aarthik utpaadan bazaar main uplabdh kul karency or us karency ke istemaal (karency in cirkulation+velocity of mani) kii dosti se banataa he
 From this formula, we can understand how much economic output (GDP) each rupee produces
 velocity of mani yani ki rupye kaa baar-baar istemaal khaasaa dilachasp he
 a doctor gave a hundred rupees to the taxi driver
 taxi vaale ne vah sau rupye dekar khaanaa khaaya
 The hotelier got the mobile charged with that hundred rupees and the mobile person gave the hundred rupees back to the same doctor for treatment
 doctor ke paas waapas aane tak vah sau rupye chaar sau rupye kaa kaarobaar kar chuke the
 The complex calculation of the Velocity of Money involves not only cash transactions, payments and investments from bank accounts
 nakadi teji se haath badalati he, jabaki vittiya nivesh dhime chalate hai
 The velocity of money in India is about eight times more than the flow of currency
 har note ausatan saat se aath (zyada bhi) baar vinimay main istemaal hota he
 The government can control the flow of currency by printing notes or making them a piece of paper (demonetisation), but the government has no control on how many times a hundred rupee note will be used (velocity)
 mani kii velocity arthvyavastha main dandiya naach kii tarah he, jisamen har naachne vaala duusare ke saath apane utsaah ko chatakata he
 Velocity increases by purchase, consumption, investment
 yah arthvyavastha main vishwaas kaa utsav he jisase maang badhati he
 Governments sometimes bring solutions that are more dangerous than the problem
 kuch chuhon ko nikaalane ke liye puure dandiya pandal main notebandi kii jahrili gas chhod di gai
 The dancers fell stoically
 karency ke saath hi velocity bhi gai or jidipi dhah gaya
 The currency is slowly coming back but the impact of the gas has deepened so much that the zeal of the Velocity bites back again (consumer survey-reserve Bank)
 aaj bhi nakadi (karency) kii uplabdhta notebandi ke pehle ke str se 20 fisadi kam he
 Digital payments have slowed down, but surprisingly the lack of cash is the success of demonetisation for the government! Governments do not run the economy
 bharat kaa jidipi desh ke logon kii mehnat or upbhog se badhata he
 Spending for personal consumption accounts for 60 per cent of GDP
 jin varshon main bharat ne sabase acchhee vikaas dar darj kii he, unamem logon kaa upbhog kharch shandaar oonchai par tha
 During demonetisation last year, in the same column we wrote that cash to GDP ratio is around 12 per cent, the bulk of which is used for consumption expenditure
 notebandi, jidipi kii saans ghontkar bharat kii aarthik raftaar tod degi
 After demonetisation, the GDP collapsed because crores of people of the country shrunk their consumption
 november ke dhamaake se pehle, arthvyavastha kii dhalaan shuru ho chuki thi
 The crisis has deepened as GST has caught consumption immediately after demonetisation
 sarkaar do kaam karte-karte lagbhag thak chuki he
 • Expenditure has been spent on the budget so that the slope can be stopped somehow but crores of consumers do not have the option of consumption
 • aarthik aankadon ko khub protein pilaayaa gaya taaki arthvyavasthake sicks packs dikhaae ja saken
 But Surat got worse in grooming
 chini darshanik laotsu kehete the, kisi mahaan desh main sarkaar chalaanaa choti machhlee ko pakaane jaisaa hota he
 Too much interference spoils the dish
 notebandi main yahi haal hua he
 Now GDP cannot recover cheap debt and neither government spending and foreign investment
 dhahati arthvyavastha ko hamaare aapke kharch kii jarurat he
 Our enthusiasm is the cure
 apane aarthik bhavishya ke liye kharch kariye
 Don't trust the government, the government is sitting on your trust

 This is exactly what the 2010 assembly election results mean for more than half of the legislators of Bihar's last legislative assembly
 lagbhag 124 vidhayak, jo pichhali baar apni seat se chunaav jite the, is baar gathit hui 243 sadasyeey 15veen bihar vidhansabha ke sadsy nahin hai
 Apparently, it has the largest number of mlas from the RJD
 party ke 54 main se 46 vidhayak, jo aktubar 2005 main hue chunaavon main vijayi rahe the, is baar apni seat barkaraar rakhane main naakaam rahe hai
 The group of unsuccessful candidates is headed by former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, who lost the election from both Sonpur and Raghopur seats
 pichhali vidhansabha main ve raghopur seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahi thim, lekin lalu prasad yadav ne surakshit rahane ke drushtikon se is baar unhen sonpur se bhi khadaa kar diya tha
 Although both the constituencies have a significant number of people belonging to their caste, they lost both seats
 jad(you) ke satish raay ne raghopur se unhen 13,006 voton se parajeet kiya to sonpur se unhen bhaajapa ke vinay kumaar singh ne 20,685 voton se parajeet kar diya
 The other big leaders of the party that were going to collapse include Shakeel Ahmed Khan, Shakuni Chaudhary, Ramchandra Purve, Pitambar Paswan and Gajendra Prasad Singh
 darasal, rajd kaa ekmaatr janaa-mana cheharaa jo chunaav kii is uthal-puthal bhari baitarani paar karne main safal rahaa, vah abdul baari siddiki kaa he
 As expected, he has been made the leader of the RJD Legislature Party in the state assembly
 paraajayon kii rajd kii kahani kaa ek vyapak arth he
 This difference becomes very clear on the occasion of the first session of the newly elected assembly
 pichley do dashak main aisa pehali baar hua he ki rajya vidhansabha main lalu prasad ke sadaiv surkiyon main rahane vaale parivaar kaa koi pratinidhi nahin he

 The ruling SP in Uttar Pradesh may not be taking a pause yet, but another political party in the state, Apna Dal, has been trying to resolve the dispute that has been going on for several months just before the assembly elections
 
 kendriya mantri anupriya patel ne apni maa krishna patel ke paas sulah kaa prastaav bheja he
 Apna Dal, which contested in the Lok Sabha elections as a BJP ally, has been in dispute for the past several months
 anupriya patel or unki maa krishna ke netritv vaale dhadon kaa yah vivaad philhal chunaav ayog ke paas lambit he
 Conciliation is now being made through some old friends of the Patel family
 is sambandh main kendriya swasthya rajya mantri anupriya ne kaha, ''krishna patel ji meri maa hai
 i always respected her and always will
 ham chaahate hai ki wo saath aaen or ham milakar janata ke bich jaaen
 Therefore a proposal has been made from our side
 '' anupriya gut ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki krishna patel dhade ke paas jo prastaav bheja gaya he usamen krishna patel ko party kaa adhyaksh banane or varanasi kii rohaniya vidhansabha seat se unako chunaav ladaane kii peshkash kii gai he, haalanki yah bhi shart rakhi gai he ki 'anupriya kii badi bahan pallavi patel party ke kaamkaaj se dur rahengi or isamen unka koi dakhal nahin hoga
 ' is netaa ne kaha, ''sone laal patel ke samay ke kuch paariwarik dost is vivaad ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 If the Krishna Patel faction is ready then this dispute can be resolved in just a few days
 '' udhar, is bare main puche jane par krishna patel gut ke netaa aar bi singh patel ne kaha, ''abhi hamaare paas koi aisa prastaav nahin aayaa he
 '' uttar pradesh kii kurmi jati par pakad rakhane vaali is party ko bhaajapa ne loksabhaa chunaav se pehle gathbandhan kii do siten di thi or party ne donon siton mirzapur or pratapgarh se jeet darj kii thi
 Anupriya Patel herself was elected from Mirzapur
 divangat sonelal patel kii viraasat ko aage le jane kii ladaai us vakt shuru hui jab krishna patel ne apni badi beti pallavi ko apana dal main padaadhikari banaaya
 The dispute between Anupriya and her mother escalated to such an extent that both reached the Election Commission and nearly separated their way
 tippaniyan a leader of the Anupriya faction said that if this attempt at reconciliation is not successful, the faction led by Anupriya will contest under the banner of a party called Apna Dal (sone Lal) and in alliance with the BJP
 is netaa ne kaha ki nai party kaa panjikaran ho gaya he or ise 'plate evam cap' chunaav nishaan bhi aavantit ho gaya he

 This dispute of factions led by Anupriya Patel and her mother Krishna is currently pending with the Election Commission
 ab patel parivaar ke kuch puraane mitron ke madhyam se sulah kii koshish ho rahi he
 In this regard, Union Minister of State for Health Anupriya said, "krishna Patel ji is my mother
 main unka hameshaa sammaan karti thi or hameshaa karti rahuungi
 We want them to come together and go together in public
 isliye hamaari ore se ek prastaav diya gaya he
 "A senior leader of the Anupriya faction said that in the proposal sent to the Krishna Patel faction, it was offered to make Krishna Patel the president of the party and contest him from the Rohania assembly seat of Varanasi, although this was also stipulated
 It is said that 'anupriya's elder sister Pallavi Patel will stay away from the party's work and she will not interfere in this
 ' This leader said, "some family friends of Sone Lal Patel's time are trying to resolve this dispute
 agar krishna patel gut taiyaar ho gaya to yah vivaad mahaj kuch din main sulajh saktaa he
 "on the other hand, when asked about this, Krishna Patel faction leader RB Singh Patel said," We have not got any such proposal yet
 '' This party, which holds the Kurmi caste of Uttar Pradesh, was given two seats by the BJP before the Lok Sabha elections and the party won both the seats from Mirzapur and Pratapgarh
 mirzapur se khud anupriya patel nirvaachit huin thi
 The battle to carry forward the legacy of the late Sone Lal Patel began when Krishna Patel made his elder daughter Pallavi an officer in the Apna Dal
 anupriya or unki maa ke bich vivaad itnaa bad gaya ki donon chunaav ayog pahunch gaye or donon ke raste takreeban alag ho gaye

 Recognition of one's presence and non-presence in the program of Yoga Day makes that program mandatory, about which the government has repeatedly said that no one is being forced
 lekin soshal media par raajnneetik samarthakon kii ek jamaat poochne lagi ki aapane yoga kiya yaa nahin
 The government may not do this, but the supporters should be cautious about this question
 hamaare aapke bich se ve koun log hai jo ganatantr diwas se lekar yoga diwas tak uparashtrapati kii pahchaan pahanaave, huliye or vishwaas ke aadhaar par karne kaa mauka dhundte rahete hai
 Look at the profile of such people on social media, a craze will be seen towards a particular religion, ideology, organization and leader
 ye wo log hai jo uparashtrapati ko aksar magnifing glass se dekhte rahete hai
 On the occasion of Republic Day, 'shem on Hamid Ansari' started trending on social media that he did not salute the tricolor during the national anthem
 uparashtrapati bhawan ko tab bhi press relies jari kerani padi thi ki raashtragan ke samay jo mukhya atithi hote hai or jo vardi main hote hai unheen ko salaami kerani hoti he
 The rest has to stand in careful posture
 pad kii sanvaidhanik garima ke baavjood unki nishtha ko vakt bevakt mazahabi chashme se parakhane kii is aadat kaa ilaaj hona chahie

 ' kam se kam maafee vaali twit to rahane dete, lekin use bhi delit kar diya
 There has also been a clarification from the Vice President House that he is not ill

 The Vice President goes to the same events where the Minister concerned invites him under the Protocol
 uparashtrapati ke bare me ram madhav kii har jaankaree galat nikali
 i was also surprised by the tweet of Swapan Das Gupta, a right-wing commentator and a man who wrote very intelligently in English newspapers
 unka bhi twit bhashaa or soch main ram madhav se kaaphi miltaa-julata rahaa, 'sabhi news channel yoga diwas kaa kaarykram dikhaa rahe hai keval ek ko chhodkar

 Ayush Minister Shripad Naik said that when the Prime Minister becomes the Chief Guest at an event, the Vice President and the President are not called
 isliye unhe aamantrit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The explanation of the Minister of Ayush is correct unke mantralay ne rajyasabha, loksabhaa or dilli ke vidhayakon ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha
 Special cards were sent
 is card main aresavipi bhale nahin likhaa gaya he yani pahunchane par kisase sampark karnaa he, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se lekar up-rajyapal najeeb jang ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 The people involved on Rajpath are not well recognized on the basis of religion
 sarkaar ne kai baar kaha he ki yoga kaa dharm se sambandh nahin he
 This should be considered the government's line, yet the media also sought Muslims from the people who came on Rajpath and made a separate headline
 camaron ne alag se khoja ki isamen musalmaan he yaa nahin
 It is also no less dangerous
 ek saal main yah doosraa mauka he jab uparashtrapati ko lekar vivaad hua he
 There were anonymous anonymous people on social media on the occasion of Republic Day, but this time two or two responsible people made direct and indirect comments
 uparashtrapati karyaalay ko do baar safai deni padi he
 Sakat Singh, a man who knows the Vice President closely, is very hurt, he has sent an email
 tippaniyan i can tell the reason for knowing Hamid Ansari Saheb for thirty years, he is a great yogi
 meraa aresas or bijepi se bhi sambandh rahaa he or maanata hum ki hamid ansaari rashtrawaad kii har paribhaasha main feet baithte hai
 He and his wife Salma ji have been doing yoga
 kya yah choti galati he jiske bare main kendriya mantri shripad nik ne kaha ki aadmi hi hai galati ho jaati he
 Again this is a mistake this time not from unknown people on social media but responsible people
 isiilie ham yah kaarykram kar rahe hai taaki teesri baar koi galati na kare
 However, Shripad Naik has apologized for this
 hamaare aapke bich se ve koun log hai jo ganatantr diwas se lekar yoga diwas tak uparashtrapati kii pahchaan pahanaave, huliye or vishwaas ke aadhaar par karne kaa mauka dhundte rahete hai

 The explanation of the Minister of Ayush is correct unke mantralay ne rajyasabha, loksabhaa or dilli ke vidhayakon ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha
 Special cards were sent
 is card main aresavipi bhale nahin likhaa gaya he yani pahunchane par kisase sampark karnaa he, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se lekar up-rajyapal najeeb jang ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 The people involved on Rajpath are not well recognized on the basis of religion
 sarkaar ne kai baar kaha he ki yoga kaa dharm se sambandh nahin he
 This should be considered the government's line, yet the media also sought Muslims from the people who came on Rajpath and made a separate headline
 camaron ne alag se khoja ki isamen musalmaan he yaa nahin
 It is also no less dangerous
 ek saal main yah doosraa mauka he jab uparashtrapati ko lekar vivaad hua he
 There were anonymous anonymous people on social media on the occasion of Republic Day, but this time two or two responsible people made direct and indirect comments
 uparashtrapati karyaalay ko do baar safai deni padi he
 Sakat Singh, a man who knows the Vice President closely, is very hurt, he has sent an email
 tippaniyan i can tell the reason for knowing Hamid Ansari Saheb for thirty years, he is a great yogi
 meraa aresas or bijepi se bhi sambandh rahaa he or maanata hum ki hamid ansaari rashtrawaad kii har paribhaasha main feet baithte hai
 He and his wife Salma ji have been doing yoga
 kya yah choti galati he jiske bare main kendriya mantri shripad nik ne kaha ki aadmi hi hai galati ho jaati he
 Again this is a mistake this time not from unknown people on social media but responsible people
 isiilie ham yah kaarykram kar rahe hai taaki teesri baar koi galati na kare
 However, Shripad Naik has apologized for this
 ganatantr diwas ke maukey par soshal media par 'shem on hamid ansaari' trend karne laga ki unhone raashtragan ke vakt tirange ko salaami nahin di
 The vice-president Bhavan still had to issue a press release that those who are the chief guests at the national anthem and those who are in uniform have to salute them
 baaki ko saavdhaan kii mudra main khadey rahanaa padataa he
 Despite the constitutional dignity of the post, his loyalty should be treated with this habit of testing it through timeless religious glasses
 bhale hi bharat sarkaar yaa uskaa koi mantri isamen shaamil nahin he, lekin samaaj or raajnneetik dal ke kuch samarthakon main aisi soch he to use gambhirtha se liya janaa chahie
 Ram Madhav, the BJP national general secretary and former spokesperson of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, deleted his tweet immediately, but by then many people had taken a photo of his tweet
 unka pehla twit tha ki 'kya rajyasabha tivi jo karadaata ke paise chalata he, yoga diwas ke kaarykram kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 The President participated but not the Vice President
 ' Rajya Sabha TV comes under Rajya Sabha
 uparashtrapati rajya sabha ke chairman hote hai
 Ram Madhav immediately deleted his tweet and then made a tweet, 'I was told that the Vice President is ill
 maine apana twit waapas le liya
 i apologize because the Vice President's institution should be respected
 ' At least let the apology tweet remain, but deleted it as well
 up raashtrapati bhawan kii taraf se bhi safai aa gai ki ve biimaar nahin hai
 For this reason he did not participate but he was not called for a yoga program
 uparashtrapati unheen kaaryakramon main jate hai jahaan sambandhit mantri protocol ke tahat unhen aamantrit karte hai
 Every information of Ram Madhav about the Vice President turned out to be wrong
 dakshinpanthi tippaneekar or angrezi ke akhbaaron main kaaphi samajhadaari se likhane vaale swapan das gupta ke twit se mujhe bhi hairaani hui
 His tweet was very similar to Ram Madhav in language and thinking, 'all the news channels are showing Yoga Day program except one

 ' 2007 main uparashtrapati pad ke liye hamid ansaari kaa naam sipiem ne badhaayaa tha to kya isliye rajyasabha ko left kaa ekmaatr channel kaha gaya

 In 2007, the name of Hamid Ansari was raised by the CPM for the post of Vice President, so why Rajya Sabha was called the only channel of the Left
 kya rajyasabha tivi ke bahaane swapan das gupta jaise gambhir lekhak or vaktaa ne uparashtrapati ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The way he writes and speaks carefully, it is difficult to say but the matter of targeting the Rajya Sabha does not even seem outside that scope
 rajyasabha ke editor in chif gurdeep sappal ne twit kar diya ki 'ek baar phir ares tivi ke kilaaf bebuniyaad afawaah ki hamane yoga diwas kaa blike out kiya
 Sheer lies
 aaj rajpath or yoga conference se ares tivi par live rahaa
 ' gurdeep sappal ne ek press release bhi jari kar bataaya ki yahaan tak videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa sanyukt raashtra main jo kaarykram hua use bhi rajyasabha tivi par dikhaaya gaya or ye sabhi kaarykram you tub par bhi uplabdh hai
 Ayush Minister Shripad Naik said that when the Prime Minister becomes the Chief Guest at an event, the Vice President and the President are not called
 isliye unhe aamantrit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The explanation of the Minister of Ayush is correct unke mantralay ne rajyasabha, loksabhaa or dilli ke vidhayakon ko bhi aamantrit kiya tha
 Special cards were sent
 is card main aresavipi bhale nahin likhaa gaya he yani pahunchane par kisase sampark karnaa he, lekin dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se lekar up-rajyapal najeeb jang ko bhi aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 The people involved on Rajpath are not well recognized on the basis of religion
 sarkaar ne kai baar kaha he ki yoga kaa dharm se sambandh nahin he
 This should be considered the government's line, yet the media also sought Muslims from the people who came on Rajpath and made a separate headline
 camaron ne alag se khoja ki isamen musalmaan he yaa nahin
 It is also no less dangerous
 ek saal main yah doosraa mauka he jab uparashtrapati ko lekar vivaad hua he
 There were anonymous anonymous people on social media on the occasion of Republic Day, but this time two or two responsible people made direct and indirect comments
 uparashtrapati karyaalay ko do baar safai deni padi he
 Sakat Singh, a man who knows the Vice President closely, is very hurt, he has sent an email
 tippaniyan i can tell the reason for knowing Hamid Ansari Saheb for thirty years, he is a great yogi
 meraa aresas or bijepi se bhi sambandh rahaa he or maanata hum ki hamid ansaari rashtrawaad kii har paribhaasha main feet baithte hai

 com / gdbvibmofh Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had played 164 Test matches for the West Indies, would have scored 86 more runs to become the highest run-scorer in Test cricket from the West Indies
 21 saal desh ke liye test cricket khilne vaale shivnarayan chandrapaul ke liye itnaa to west indies kar hi saktaa tha jisase is khilaadi ko yah kirtiman hasil karne kaa mauqaa mil jaataa
 But this did not happen and now it seems that Chandrapaul's cricket career is over, as he has not been included in the 12 players who have taken training
 mukhya chayankarta clive loyad ne chandrapaul ke haalia form ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha he ki pichhali 11 pariyon main unka ausat sirf 16 kaa rahaa he, jo ki team ke zyaada kaam nahin aayaa
 Not only this, Lloyd said that now Chandrapol is 40 years old and given this, now West Indies cricket will have to think ahead of him
 tippaniyan Many players associated with West Indies cricket are calling it an injustice with Chanderpaul, as he should have got a chance to score 86 runs
 chandrapaul tab bhi west indies cricket ke saath jude rahe the, jab team ke baaki sadsy duniya bhar main tii-20 cricket ke chakachaundh ke bich desh kii taraf se khilne kii bajaay alag-alag klbon se paison kii khaatir khilne main zyaada dilchaspee dikhaa rahe the
 Chanderpaul has played 164 Test matches for the West Indies, including 51
 37 kii ausat se unhone 11867 ran banaae
 He is just 86 runs away from Brian Lara
 unke naam 30 test shatak or 66 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who played Test cricket for the country for 21 years, could have done so much for the West Indies, which would have given this player a chance to achieve this record
 magar aisa nahin hua or ab lagata he ki chandrapaul kaa cricket kariyar khatm ho gaya he, kyonki unhen training lene vaale 12 khilaadiyon main bhi shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Chief selector Clive Lloyd attributed Chandrapaul's recent form saying that he averaged just 16 in the last 11 innings, which did not work much for the team
 itnaa hi nahin loyad ne kaha ki ab chandrapaul kii umr 40 saal kii ho chuki he or ise dekhte hue ab west indies cricket ko unke aage ke bare main sochna hoga
 The comments west indies cricket se jude kai khilaadi ise chandrapaul ke saath ninsaphi bataa rahe hai, kyonki 86 ran banane kaa mauka unhen milanaa hi chahie tha
 Chanderpaul was still associated with West Indies cricket when the rest of the team was showing more interest in playing for money from different clubs than playing for the country amid the glare of T20 cricket around the world
 
 chandrapaul ne west indies ke liye khelte hue 164 test match khele he, jisamen 51
 He scored 11867 runs at an average of 37
 vah bryan lara se sirf 86 ran dur hai
 His name includes 30 Test centuries and 66 half-centuries

 bataa den ki soochna or prasaaran mantralay ne news channelon ko ek adwijuri jari karte hue 'dalit' shabd istemaal karne se bachane kaa aagrah kiya he
 The Information and Broadcasting Ministry had issued this advisory citing the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court in the Advisory
 isse pehle athavle ne kaha tha ki 'dalit' shabd istemaal karne par unhen koi aapatti nahin he
 He said that the order not to use the word Dalit should be reconsidered
 athavle ne kaha ki ve sarkaar ke aadesh kaa samarthan karte hai, lekin bolchaal kii bhashaa main dalit kehane par kisi ko aapatti nahin honi chahie
 According to Athawale, the schedule is called in the government records
 sarkari kaary main dalit shabd kaa istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he
 But in speaking, only Dalits speak
 athavle ne kaha ki hamane dalit sanghathan banaaya tha
 Those who are economically socially backward people in the society should speak Dalit, so i think that the government records should not use the word Dalit, but there is no problem in using the word Dalit in talking, writing
 ramdaas athavle ne kaha ki jo vyapak shabd he us par aapatti nahin honi chahie
 It is not right to speak Dalit only for the schedule cast
 jo garib, pichde log hai unke liye dalit shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 There should be no objection in this, but the word Dalit should not be used for schedule cast
 yah sarkaar kaa sochna he
 i welcome him

 ham bhi nahin chaahate ki iskaa galat istemaal ho
 He said that the upper castes should not agitate
 meri apil he ki sabhi log baithkar iskaa samaadhaan nikaalen
 There will be no benefit from agitating
 pashchim bengal ke malda main gram panchayat ke tughluqi farmaan par ek mahila ko gaanv main saream beizzat kiya gaya or baad main use ped se baandhakar yatnaaen di gai
 The woman is a teacher by profession
 maamla malda ke angreji bazaar police thana kshetra ke amariti gaanv kaa he
 Where 40-year-old Ajida came to meet his family on his father's home
 tabhi vahaan gaanv waalon kii ek bheed ai or ajeeda ko uske ghar se baahar khinch liya
 He was beaten up and tortured by tying him to a tree
 ajeeda ke saath is vaardaat ko gaanv keepanchayat ke ek tughluqi farmaan ke baghnjam diya gaya
 On receiving the information, the police reached the spot and rescued Azida
 uski haalat najuk hone kii vajah se police use malda aspataal le gai
 Where he is being treated
 police ne bataaya ki ajeeda bibi saal 2009 main gaanv ke hi ek skool kii incharge thi
 At the same time, he filed a case against three youths of the village for stealing construction related goods from the school premises
 unki shikaayat par police ne teenon yuvakon ko jail bhej diya tha
 He later came out on bail
 tabhi teenon yuvakon ne ajeeda bibi se badla lene kii thaan lee thi
 And demanded action against the village panchayat
 panchayat ne tughluqi farmaan sunaate hue ajeeda ke gaanv main aane par roak laga di thi

 kya yuvaraj world tii-20 ke final match ke vaaki sabase bade villen the yaa phir fans or kai jaankaar bhi overriect kar rahe hai
 Sachin Tendulkar says that Yuvraj should be criticized, but it is not right to hang him
 sachin sirf saathi hone ke naate nahin balki ek cricketer kii tarah yuvaraj kii pari kii aalochana kar rahe hai
 The match figures further clarify this picture
 rohit sharma ke out hone ke baad yuvaraj singh final main gyarahawein (10
 4) On the pitch in the over and nineteenth 19th
 1 over At the beginning of the day, departed disappointedly
 lekin pich par bitaye gaye ye aadhe ghante kaa vakt yuvaraj ke puure cricket kariyar kaa shaayad sabase mushkil lamhaa rahaa hoga
 Fans of Team India were expecting Yuvraj to perform like superheroes in this final too, as they always expect
 is baar yuvi fans kii ummiido kii is kasuti par khara nahin utre
 But was Yuvraj alone unblemished on the pitch or were the Sri Lankan bowlers bowling better than expected, and perhaps any batsman could be unaided
 zaraa match ke in aankadon par gaur farmaayen jo ek alag tasviir pesh karti he
 Yuvraj scored 11 off 21 balls, could not make any boundary
 vaise puri pari main viraat kohli or rohit sharma ke alaava koi khilaadi boundry nahin laga sakaa
 Yuvraj scored 11 runs in singles and played nine dot balls
 inamen rangana herath ne yuvaraj ke kilaaf do, sachitra senanayake ne chah or lasith milega ne ek dot gend daali
 That is, Yuvraj could not score runs on so many balls
 yahi nahin senanayake ne yuvi ko sabase zyada pareshaan kiya, lekin senanayake ke kilaaf puri pari main sirf do chauke lage
 The most in-form batsman of the tournament, Virat Kohli, was present at the crease since Rohit Sharma's arrival in the 11th over, but Virat Kohli played 6 dot balls as long as Yuvraj was at the crease
 yahi nahin super heater captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa balla bhi saat main se chaar gend chhu nahin paaya
 Captain MS Dhoni came to the press conference after the match and said we have to give credit to the Sri Lankan bowlers
 unhone apni yojana ke mutabik gendbaazi kii
 He bowled accurate wide yorker balls against which our batsmen found it difficult to score runs
 yani ye maanane se inkaar nahin karnaa chahie ki deth over main srilankai gendbaazon ne shandaar gendbaazi kii
 Yuvraj could have done much more according to his talent, but due to a bad performance, it is too much to make a hero into a villain

 march khatm hote-hote maut ne jaise apane bahi khate kaa aakhri hisaab vasuul liya- hindi kii jaani-maani lekhak, sampadak or sanchayankarta ramanika gupta ko apane saath le gai
 Our kind professional tribute writer left behind - to state that this year marks the fourth loss to Hindi literature after Archana Verma, Krishna Sobti and Namwar Singh and to add that Ramanika Gupta died at the age of 89 It is a matter of realizing the entirety of one's life, not of mourning
 ramanika ji se meri aakhri mulaakaat ittifaaq se ek shradhanjali sabha main hui thi
 She had come to the program organized in memory of Archana Varma at Rajendra Bhavan in Delhi and was sitting in the first row
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki ve 20 din aspataal main rahakar ai thim
 There was also some feeling of the discomfort that she must have been suffering from some of her rough and bewildered faces
 lekin maine kuch hansate hue kaha- aapako kuch nahin hoga, aap baar-baar lautakar aati rahengi
 i had been repeating this joke to him in the past few meetings
 dilli main rahete hue bhi unke paas na jane kii, kabhi unka haal-chaal na le paane kii jo kaifiyat mere paas nahin hua karti thi, use taalane ke lihaaj se yah majaak bahut kargar hua karata tha
 She would laugh
 ve jis jeevat or jujharu maansikta kii mahila thim- uskaa mujhe andaaza tha
 They had made political movements, had also beaten the police on a number of occasions, fought the diseases continuously and got up again
 na jane kitne saal unhone mrityu ko apane darvaaze se lautaaya hua tha
 i had an old acquaintance with him
 jab dilli unako thik se nahin jaanati thi, tab se main unako jaanata tha
 She came to our house for the first time sometime around 1985
 ve hamaare yahaan kuch din thahari bhi thim
 Over the next few years, a kind of family bond was formed with him
 ittifaaq se meri bilkul praarambhik kahaniyon main ek 'vajah' unki patrika 'aam aadmi' main chhapi thi
 He later named it 'warring Aam Admi'
 jab meri kahani chhapi tab shaayad main 18 saal kaa tha
 In later issues he also printed my poems and published them in a shared collection
 unheen dinon unka kavita sangrah 'prakruti yuddhrat he' chap kar aayaa tha
 i wrote a long review of it for 'pataliputra Times'
 yah shaayad 1987 kaa saal tha
 At the age of 19, my understanding of poetry must have been building, but that collection impressed me a lot
 vah samiksha baad main ramanika ji ne apane kisi sangrah main shaamil bhi kii
 In the 90s Ramanika made Delhi her home and her workplace
 ve mahatvakankshi bhi thim or saadhan sampann bhi
 Delhi took him by the hands
 lekin ramanika gupta ne apni mul praathamiktaayen kabhi badali nahin
 Dalit, tribal and women's literature were his central concerns
 aane vaale varshon main unhone jaise apni sari urja, apni sari nidhi jaise inhen sarokaaron ke liye jhonk di
 The special issue on the special issue of the warring common man, not only Hindi in itself, but has become the heritage of Indian literature
 alag-alag bhashaaon main mahilaon dwaara likhi gai rachanaaon par kendrit unhone ek shrunkhlaa "haashie ulanghti stri' ke naam se prakashit kii
 Dalit literature of different languages was also published

 5stradirector: Sujoy Ghoshlakarakar: Vidya Balan, Arjun Rampal and Jugal Hansrajsal When Jabsujoy Ghosh brought 'kahani' in 2012, its thriller and suspense factor kept the audience on the chairs and no one could move from their seat
 lekin chaar saal baad sujoy laute to film main har vah baat missing thi jo pichhali baar isaki takat thi
 Bollywood has been making a mistake for a long time that it makes a sequel just to make a sequel
 aisa hi is baar bhi hua
 The story of Durga Rani Singh is very weak, there are so many loopholes that the film fails to deliver thriller and suspense fun from anywhere
 film kii kahani dekhakar aisa lagata he ki diarector ke paas film banaate samay koi kahani nahin thi, balki kuch chote-chote kisse the, jinhen ve ek-duusare se jodate chale gaye or is pher main na to vah shashakt kahani hi bana sake or na hi thriller or suspence vaala majaa hi de sake
 How much power in the story: The story of the film is of Vidyasinha aka Durga Rani Singh
 uski ek beti he, jo chal nahin sakati
 Vidya has to be treated
 lekin ek din achaanak wo bitiyaa gaayab ho jaati he, or vidya ko pataa chalata he ki uskaa apharan ho gaya he
 Meanwhile, Vidya falls victim to an accident
 phir vah aspataal pahunch jaati he, or is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe police adhikari arjuna rampal ke haath vidya kii ek diary lagati he, or phir vidya or durga ke jivan ke ek-ek adhyay saamne aane lagate hai
 There is a case of child sexual abuse in the story, and the director has also tried to raise her well
 lekin kahani kii continyuty main yah factor kahin jaakar missing ho jaataa he or diarector alag-alag dishaao main daudane lagata he
 The film begins in a very interesting way, but then everything becomes very clear and natural
 film main kai sawaal paidaa hote hai
 Like, the crime begins eight years later, about eight years later
 film main lav story ko jabaran kyon ghuseda gaya he? iske alaava pati vaala factor bhi ajeeb he
 There are many questions like this
 star apil:vidya baalan is tarah ke kairactor bakhubi nibhaati hai, or is baar bhi unhone kuch aisa hi karne kii koshish kii he
 But his character is not as clear as last time and many questions related to him are incomplete
 vidya ne kuch bhi nayaa nahin kiya he or aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo chaunkaane vaala ho
 Arjun rampalsmart is engaged and has played the role of a police officer properly
 jugal hansraj bhi ekadam saamaanya hai
 Bengali actor Kharaj Mukherjee has acted well in the role of police officer, the rest is average
 kamai kii baat:sujoy ghosh kam bajet filmein banane main maahir hai, or 'kahani2' bhi mid bajet movie he
 Sujoy is hype about films and his film with Vidya has a good record
 lekin is baar kai morchon par daudti kahani niraash karti he
 Anyway, due to demonetisation, the atmosphere is running very tight and in view of this, 'kahaani-2' is being given special consideration on multiplexes
 film tukdon main to thik he lekin bhaagti nahin he
 Overall, 'kahaani 2' disappoints

 Taking a dig at the two centers of Congress power on Wednesday, the BJP said, "sonia has given up the post of Prime Minister but is not able to give up the power
" bijepi ne kaha ki congress ne aadhikarik taur par satta ke do kendra hone kii baat sweekaar karke is baat kii pushti kar di he ki satta ke kathith ‘tyaag’ ke daawey ke baavjood samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi satta kaa bhoga kar raheen hai
 Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said that there was a ruckus between two Congress general secretaries Digvijay Singh and Janardan Dwivedi for having two centers of power, but both have confirmed that UPA has two centers of power and One of them is held by Sonia

 He remains a center of power
 ' bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, chintaa kii baat yah he ki sonia jis satta kaa kendra bani hui hai, uski kahin koi javabdehi nahin he
 Being Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh has accountability everywhere including Parliament
 unhone kaha ki singh ko kuch logon dwaara ‘majaboor, kamjor or yahaan tak ki kathputli’ pradhanmantri tak kaha jaataa he
 But the Prime Minister should not be strong, but he should be centered

 i think it is a role model for any democracy and also for the future

 He suggested that if the party gets a majority in the next general election, no one should be nominated prime minister by Rahul Gandhi

 Once, six brothers started digging the pond for water
 gaharaa kodane par bhi pani niksaa nahin
 Before they get disappointed, a Baba arrives, begging
 
 
 marand buru
 Baba told the solution for the release of water- "donate to your sister Upal
 ’’chaho bhaaiyon ne duusare din basayam daaka arthath jalpan lekar bahan ko bulaayaa
 Uppal knows the path of the farm
 bhaaiyon ke kehane par hal se khinche gaye chinh ko dekhte hue vah unke paas pahunchi
 Turning water after refreshment
 upal chali talab se pani laane
 At the behest of the six brothers, Dried entered the pond
 chamatkaar! pani nikal aayaa
 What is the truth of Marand Buru? But water came out only up to the feet

 His life dissolves in water worries

 Upaal and Chaila rival each other from debate to education

 But for a long time, both of them could not remain in front of each other

 Bindadham temple often appeared side by side

 They do not realize, morning is about to happen, Ratrani is about to absorb its fragrance
 upal ne sochaa, apni maa se baat karegi
 Pleading to pick up the thorns along the way, but has complete faith in his bag
 vishwaas to devi maa par bhi he
 The time of Dussehra is swollen with worship
 dhoop-agarbati se puraa parisar suvasit
 In the yajna-vedikas, fire still ignited by rubbing with stone

 No! No! Take it away from society

 Flowed like water for so many days
 dhyaan hi nahin gaya, hajaaron ankhen lag gayi hai
 My Baba has started seeing with a thousand eyes
 maay kaa jharne main nahaane, pani laane, kheton main ropa karne, fasalon ko masalane-kootane sab main vyavdhaan aane laga he
 Now, when understood, the noose fell in front
 “kisi or se gira?” donon cheekh pade
 Unthinkable! Deep sense of error

 Impossible

 What is the Hindu Marriage Act? The Hindu Marriage Act was enacted to bind marriages to legal conditions
 ye baat aazaadee ke 8 saal baad 1955 kii he
 Since then, there have been many amendments in this act
 hamaari parampara main kahawat to ye he ki shaadiyaan swarg me tay hoti hai
 Only 7 words of 7 rounds are enough to handle it
 lekin badalte jamaane kii ye sahajata kai pechidagiyon se bhar chuki he
 The Hindu Marriage Act was promulgated in the Constitution to avoid these complexities
 shaadiyon ko tuutane se bachaane or ise kanoonee sharton main baandhne ke liye 1955 main hindu marij act banaaya gaya
 But the problem of shattering relationships is that the court also had to make the act flexible
 agar kisi bhi shaadi ko bachaane kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachi ho, rishta todane par pati-patni donon sahamat hon, to 6 maheene kii ‘kooling period’ se pehle bhi talaak diya ja saktaa he
 The country's high court gave this decision in a private case
 lekin ye faisla ishaara karata he, rishton kii ghutan se mukti paane kii chatapataahat vakt ke saath kitni badhati gai he
 Along with this, amendments have also been made in the Hindu Marriage Act
 masalan, mul kanoon main ladakon ke liye shaadi kii umr 18 saal or ladakiyon kii 15 saal thi, jise aage chalakar 21 saal or 18 saal kiya gaya
 Earlier, marriage by Hindu customs was considered to be valid, later legal provision was made in it
 talaak kii sharton main bhi badlaav kiya jaataa rahaa
 After the divorce the wives were taken care of compensation
