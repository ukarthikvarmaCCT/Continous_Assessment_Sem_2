 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in Andhra Pradesh during Mission South, lashed out at the Chief Minister of the state, Chandrababu Naidu
 senior-junior ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue piem modi ne manch se bataaya ki naidu kin baton main senior hai
 During this, he took a dig at Naidu and said that he is also very senior in losing election after election
 piem modi ne guntur main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue bataaya ki main to hairaan hum ki aakhir mukhyamantri ji ko ho kya gaya he? unhone kaha, 'wo baar-baar mujhe ye yaad dilaate hai ki wo mujhase bahut senior hai
 What is the dispute in this? You are a senior, so i never miss a thing in your honor
 'iske baad piem modi ne chun-chunakar chandrababu naidu ko nishaanaa banaaya or bataaya ki vah kis cheez main senior hai
 PM Modi said - You are senior in changing the party and forging alliances - You are senior in stabbing father-in-law's back-you are senior in losing election-by-election-you can be abused, you are senior in sitting on his lap- You are a senior in hurting the dreams of Andhra Pradesh

 Reminding history to Chandrababu Naidu, PM Modi further said that the party which insulted Andhra Pradesh was called NTR Rogue, today the Chief Minister has become friends of the same party
 piem modi ne jansabha main yah bhi poocha ki NTR kii viraasat sanbhaalane vaale ne unke sapanom ko saakaar karne kaa vaada kiya tha yaa nahin kiya tha? NTR ke kadamon par chalane kaa vaada kiya tha yaa nahin kiya tha? kya aaj wo NTR ko sammaan de rahe hai?parivaar par bhi nishanapiem modi ne chandrababu naidu ke parivaar ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya

 piem modi ne kaah ki unhone andhra ke garibon ke liye nai yojanaayen chalaane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin modi kii yojanaon par hi apana steekar laga diya he
 Please tell that Chandrababu Naidu's party has been a part of TDP Modi government

 The debate in the case ended at 5 pm on Wednesday and the Supreme Court reserved its verdict
 ab har kisi kii nazar sirf is maamle ke faisle par he
 a five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi heard the issue and will now write the historic verdict
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki is maamle par ek maheene ke andar faisla aa saktaa he, haalanki adaalat kii ore se faisle kii koi taarikh nishchit nahin kii gai he
 Behind which many arguments are being given, the lawyers of both the parties are claiming that the verdict is going to come in their favor

 November 17
 aise main vakeelon ko ummid he ki unke ritairement se pehle is maamle main faisla aa jayega
 Earlier, the Chief Justice himself has also said that he wants to end the hearing of the case before October 18, because one month is also required to write the judgment
 agar aisa nahin hota he, to faisla aane main lanbaa samay lag saktaa he
 The journey from the decision reserve to the decision comes often in people's minds, why is it taking a month after the decision is reserved
 lekin faisla likhe jane main kaaphi samay vyateet hota he, kyonki iske liye ek lambii research jaruri hoti he
 During the judgment, examples of old and historical judgments are given, Sher-shayari, poems, slokas etc
 have also been part of the Judgment

 On the second day of the monsoon session on July 18, when the House proceedings began, Mayawati wanted to raise the issue of recent incidents against Dalits and minorities
 lekin upasabhapati kii ore se unhen mahaj teen minute kaa samay diya gaya
 Mayawati was agitated by repeated pauses of her incomplete speech and left the house threatening to resign
 mayawati ne rajyasabha se istipha de diya, lekin unka istipha sweekaar ho, isaki sambhaavna bahut kam hi he
 Actually, the rule of Parliament is that no member can resign with any detail
 istipha mahaj ek line kaa ho saktaa he jisamen kaha gaya ho ki ukt sadsy apane pad se istipha dena chahta he jise sweekaar kar liya jaae
 Resignations made with any description, argument or explanation cannot be accepted in the House
 varsh 2006 main siddhu ke istife kaa khaarij kiya janaa or phir november 2016 main captain amarinder singh ke istife ko isi aadhaar par nirast kar diya gaya tha
 Both members had to resign one line again
 to phir mayawati ke is istife kaa nihitarth kya he
 The answer lies in Mayawati's speech and her resignation
 mayawati ne ek tir se kai nishaan karne kii koshish kii he
 He tried to give the message that despite being a member of the House, he was not allowed to speak on the atrocities and violence of Dalits
 mayawati kaa yah gussa kahin na kahin unhen phir dalit agenda se jodega
 She cleverly wants to take credit for the violence and protest in Saharanpur
 vah bhim army se credit lete hue, rajyasabha se istipha dekar yah darshane kii koshish main hai ki vah daliton ke liye itnaa bada tyaag bhi kar sakati hai
 This can be called a big message for bsp's hardcore voters
 pichley do vidhansabha or ek sansadeey chunaav main haar kaa saamana kar chuki mywati ko is baat kaa andaja he ki kaise dalit voter bispi ke haath se phisal rahaa he
 At the same time, BJP had put Mayawati in a dilemma by nominating Ramnath Kovind, a Dalit face of Uttar Pradesh, for the post of President
 kovind kaa raashtrapati bananaa tay he or is jeet ke zarie bijepi dalit vot bank par or majbootee se haq jamaane kii koshish karegi
 The thing to note is that Mayawati has resigned and given a shock to the BJP when the party wants to make itself friendly to the Dalits by making the Dalit face president
 mayawati ne raashtrapati chunaav ke din do took kaha, koi bhi jite, par yah saaf he ki ek dalit is desh kaa president banane ja rahaa he
 This is happening only because of Ambedkar's dreams and his politics
 duusare hi din unhone daliton ke prati hinsa kaa sawaal auki saharanpur kii ghatana par bolne kii koshish kii or aisa na karne dene par sadan se istipha de diya
 His motive was to send a clear message that the BJP wants to capture the vote bank by electing Ram Nath Kovind as the presidential candidate, but in reality the BJP is anti-dalit
 mayawati ke liye yah istipha kahin se bhi haar kaa sauda nahin he
 She became a Rajya Sabha member in 2012
 unka kaarykaal sirf 9 maheene kaa bachaa he
 Given the current situation, it is difficult to return to the Rajya Sabha
 par vah dalit ke mudde par bijepi ko nishaanaa banaakar house main anya partiyon kaa saport jarur paaengi
 Mayawati's fort is collapsing, so she has little time to maintain her existence
 mayawati karo yaa maro kii sthiti main he
 Many of his party leaders, many of his close ones have left the party in the last several years
 daliton kii rani kahi jane vaali mayawati ko apana kila bachaane ke liye istipha dena unke pehle kadam ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 She will not only come into the discussion once again, but her question will also increase
 lekin yah pehla kadam hi he
 If she misses to move ahead and reach among the people, then there is little scope for improvement in the condition
 bihar main lalu yadav kii vaapasi unke liye ek udhaaharan he
 It is to see what Mayawati learns from them

 hindu samaaj main jis prakaar shri ram navami kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar sita navami kaa bhi he
 Just as Ashtami Tithi is related to the emergence of Bhagwati Radha and Lord Shri Krishna, similarly Navami Tithi is highly revered by the date of the appearance of Bhagwati Sita and Lord Shri Rama
 bhagwati radha kaa aavirbhaav bhadrapada shukla ashtami or bhagwaan shri krishna kaa aavirbhaav bhadrapada krishna ashtami ko arthath do vibhinn ashtami tithiyon main hua
 Similarly, the appearance of Bhagwati Sita occurred on Vaishakh Shukla Navami and Lord Shri Ram on Chaitra Shukla Navami i
e
 two different Navami dates
 sita navami ke bare main vistaar se bataa rahe hai shri kaashi vishwanath mandir varanasi ke nyaas parishad sadasypandit prasad dikshit-devi kaa prakatya utsavvaishakh maas kii shukla navami ko jabaki pushya nakshatra tha, mangal ke din santan prapti kii kaamana se yajna kii bhoomi taiyaar karne ke liye raja janak hal se bhoomi jot rahe the
 At the same time, the goddess appeared from the earth
 joti hui bhoomi ko tathaa hal kii nok ko bhi sita kehete hai
 Hence the famous Bhagwati became famous in the world as Sita
 isi navami kii paavan tithi ko bhagwati sita kaa prakatya utsav manaaya jaataa he
 What to do Sita Navami on Ashtami Tithi should be constructed with routine works and make beautiful mandapas on the pure land, which should be installed on the beautiful square Vedika in the middle of the pavilion from Toran etc
 Bhagwati Sita and Lord Shri Rama
 pujan ke liye swarna, rajat, tamra, pital, evam mitti inamen se yathasambhav kisi ek vastu se bani hui pratimaa kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 In the absence of an idol, work can also be done from the screen
 jo bhakt maansik puja karte hai unki to pujan saamagree evam aradhy sabhi bhav main hi hote hai
 Along with the idol of Bhagwati Sita and Lord Shri Rama, the idols of King Janak, Mata Sunaina, Purohit Shatanand ji, Hull and Mother Earth should also be installed for worship
 navami ke din nity karm se nivrutt hokar shri janaki ram kaa sankalp purvak pujan karnaa chahie
 First of all, we should worship Shri Ganesh Ji and Bhagwati Parvati with Panchopchar
 phir mandap ke paas hi ashtadal camel par vidhipurvak kalash kii sthapana kerani chahie
 If there is prana-prestige in the pavilion, then the idol or picture installed in the pavilion should have prana-status
 pratimaa ke kapadon kaa sparsh karnaa chahie
 Bhagwati Sita should meditate according to the verse
 aaj ke din mata sita kii pujan karne se sarvshereshth laabh praapt hota he

 On May 24, a tribal court in Bada, the capital of Pakistan's Khyber Agency area, called that Dr
 shakeel afridi ko 'gaddari' ke iljaam main 33 saal kii jail kii sajaa sunai, jisane duniya ke sabase vaanchit aatankwaadi osama bin laden ko dhundne main madad kii thi
 Afridi carried out a fake vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples, which helped the US intelligence agency identify the bin Laden family hiding in a compound in Abbottabad
 is faisle se pakistan or america ke bich pehle se bigadate sambandh or taar-taar hone ko hai
 This hearing, conducted in a confidential manner, lasted only two and a half months

 On the contrary, the trial against three lashkar-e-toiba operatives has been going on for three years, which India has called a conspiracy to attack Mumbai on 26 November 2008
 in hamalon main 166 log maare gaye the
 Three accused-
 jacki-ur-rahamaan lakhvi, jerar shah or abu al-kama ko mujaffarabad main unke adde par sena ke chaape ke baad giraftaar kiya gaya tha or 19 farvari, 2009 ko vishesh adaalat main pesh kiya gaya
 jamaat-ud-dawa's mastermind Hafiz Saeed is also roaming freely, considered by all to be the mastermind of the attack
 lahore main ek aatankwaad virdohi vishesh adaalat ne use 16 farvari, 2009 ko 26 / 11 se sambandhit saare aaropon se bari kar diya
 After this, the Lahore High Court quashed all cases against Saeed on October 12, 2009 and set him free
 adaalat ne yah bhi faisla sunaaya ki jamaat pratibandhit sanghathan nahin he or pakistan main khuleam kaam kar saktaa he
 Pakistan's civil society activists were disappointed by Saeed's decision to leave Azad, who saw it as a failure to punish those involved in the horrific 26 / 11 attacks
 peshawar ke rahane vaale ek vakil, jo apana naam nahin ujagar karnaa chaahate, kehete hai, ''faisla karne main kai saal laga dena pakistani adaalaton kaa itihaas rahaa he
 However, the quick hearing of the tribal court in Afridi's case is evidence that the Establishment (pakistani Army) wanted to send him behind bars
 '' apni baat sabit karne ke liye vah jamaat sargana ko chhodane kaa bhi zikr karte hai
 He says, "the Pakistani establishment does not want to put the Jamaat kingpin behind bars and that is why his case was never seriously investigated
" isi kaa nateeja he ki vah chhootane main safal rahaa
 During the Home Secretary level talks held in Islamabad on 24-25 May, India presented fresh evidence against Saeed
 pakistan kii ore se abhi us par jawaab diya janaa baaki he
 Pakistan's nominal record of punishing terrorists has been further weakened by Saeed's release
 kukhyat shiya virdohi sanghathan lashkar-e-jhangavi kaa netaa malik ishak lahore kii kot lakhapat jail main 14 saal bitaane ke baad is saal janvari main reeha ho gaya
 He had 44 cases of murder and terrorism, out of which he was acquitted in 34 cases and was given bail in the remaining 10 cases
 uski rihaai is kaaran khaas taur par vivaadaaspad he, kyonki lahore main srilankai krickwt team par hue hamale kaa mastermind vahi tha
 Other rulings have also reinforced the general belief that Pakistani courts are soft on terrorists
 13 may ko ek aatankwaad virdohi adaalat ne un nau sandigdhon ko reeha kar diya, jinhen 25 farvari, 2008 ko pakistani sena ke tatkaaleen sarjan general mushtak beg par aatmghaatee bam hamale ke silsile main giraftaar kiya gaya tha

 On May 25, 2010, the Supreme Court of Pakistan rejected an appeal filed by the officials of Pakistan's Union Home Ministry against the release of Saeed from detention
 17 april, 2009 ko supreme court ne aadesh diya ki islamabad kii laal masjid ke bade maulavee moulana abdul ajij ko maamle kii sunwaayee shuru hone tak jamaanat par reeha kiya jaae

 media par nishaanaa saadhe hue argedy pramukh ne kaha ki media bijepi se darataa he or isliye is vivaad ko tool de rahaa he
 According to Lalu, there is no tension inside the Bihar government

 Experts from all over the world discussed challenging matters
 iraq ke duusare sabase bade shahar mosul se teen saal pehle laapata hue 39 bharatiyon kaa sach aakhir he kya? wo zindaa hai bhi yaa nahin? agar jinda hai to kahaan hai? ye wo sawaal hai jinke jawaab thik-thik naa iraq sarkaar de rahi he or naa hi bharat sarkaar
 Now Aaj Tak's team reached Mosul in search of those 39 Indians and then went to that rogue jail
 jiske bare main pehle kaha gaya tha ki wo 39 bhartiya usee jail main band hai
 However, after reaching there, the truth of the rogue prison came to the fore
 kya sachmuchamosulaki badoosh jail malbe main badal chuki he? kya sachmuch june 2104 se pehle tak badoosh jail hua karti thi? or kya badoosh jail main hi 2014 se laapata 39 bharatiyon ko kabhi rakhaa gaya tha? or kya badoosh jail main band saare kaidiyon ko baad main iesas ne maar dipha? sawaal bahut saare hai
 But neither Iraq nor India is giving a clear answer
 aaie ab aapako badoosh jail or usamen band saare kaidiyon kaa sach or anjaam bataate hai
 That too in detail
 10 june 2014 ko aatank ke kabze main aane ke baad july 2017 tak ninava praant kii badoosh jail main kya hua
 How did it happen
 kab hua
 Nobody knows anything
 sivaae uske jo unhone duniya ko bataanaa chaha or unhone jo bataaya uske mutabik ain kabze vaale din jail ke andar ghuskar aatankiyon ne pehle aatanki soch rakhane vaale apane saathiyon ko alag kiya or phir baaki bache kaidiyon ko jail kii chauhaddi se 500 meter dur le jaakar line se khadaa karke goli maar di
 Among the slain prisoners were Shia Muslims and other religious denominations
 maare gaye logon main koun the
 What were their names
 unki pahchaan kya thi
 Nobody knows anything, including the Iraqi government
 haa magar is ghatana ke kareeb paune teen saal baad iraqi sena kii popular mobilizeshan force ne maas grev milane kaa daawa kiya he
 That is, a grave in which more than 400 prisoners were killed and buried together
 lekin jab ye daawa kiya gaya tab yahaan jail nahin thi
 It was just debris
 jisamen cimented deevaaren or jail ke kuch nishaan the
 It was believed that the terrorists had thrown bullets into the jail with a blast
 magar dhamaakaa karne se pehle aatankiyon ne jail main maujuud zaruri chizon ko iraqi sainikon se lut liya tha
 However, there is no information about when this jail was demolished
 iraqi sena ko jo samuhik kabrgah mili he use nahar kii tarah khoda gaya tha
 And standing in it, the prisoners were shot with bullets
 aaj bhi is lambii chaudee kabr main laashon ke avshesh aasaani se dekhe ja sakate hai
 We cannot show you all the pictures because it is disturbing
 magar jo dikhaa sakate hai wo ye kapade hai jo yahaan dafnaae jane vaale logon ne pahan rakhe the
 At present, these bodies are being investigated
 maare gaye logon main kisibharatiyake hone kii pushti abhi tak nahin ho pai he
 Nor has there been any evidence that the Indians who were in this rogue prison in Ninevah are alive
 ninava praant main mosul ke uttari hisse main bani badoosh jail
 There used to be one of the most secure prisons in Iraq
 magar aatankiyon ne na sirf yahaan band kaidiyon kaa narsanhaar kiya balki is jail ko hi mitti main mila diya
 Apart from this, there was also a cement factory built in 1955 in this area
 jise bhi aatankiyon ne lootakar us par kabza kar liya tha
 However, he is now freed from the clutches of terror
 jo duniya ko apane jhande kii tarah kaale rang main rangane niklaa tha
 Something like this has been found in the soil against him
 magar mosul main mitti main milane se pehle duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas ne is khubasurat shahar ko jo zakhm diya he
 It will take years to fade away his stains
 barbaad galiyaan
 Looty streets

 Aaj Tak is the first news channel in the country to reach Iraq and the Iraqi city of Mosul after the defeat of Atakam in Mosul and the victory of humanity

 kadam-kadam par khatra barkaraar he
 There are many areas where there is still no permission to go
 kyonki bagdadi ke bichhaae barood ab bhi jinda hai
 No guarantee of where, when and what will happen
 ajtak kii team ko har kadam aise hi khataron se hokar guzarana tha
 But it was necessary to pass so that the truth of Mosul and the clue of 39 Indian hostages missing from last three years can be found

 gaanv ke logon ne jab babulal or uske bhai bhanvaralaal ko gaanv ke mandir main puja karne se roka to inhone apane ghar main hi bajrang bali kii murti lagaakar tin shed daalkar puja shuru kar di
 Due to fear of getting the temple dirty, the villagers stopped the entry of Dalits in the temple, saying that the temple was dirty

 mahilaayein adhik daraavne sapane bhi dekhati hai
 At the same time, men dream of flying in their dreams, gaining magical power, killing someone or traveling to other planets
 study main yah baat bhi ai he ki jaise-jaise umr badhati he, alag-alag chizon ke sapane kam hote jate hai

 1-doing each and every work with your partner- It is a good thing that you have got such a partner with whom you can share everything and can do everything with them
 lekin ek healdi relationships ke liye or khud ke alag anubhavon ke liye aapako kuch chizon apane partner ke bina bhi kerani chahie

 Baba Asaram, the prisoner sitting for bail, felt disappointed
 lekin jail kii charadivari ke peeche asaram ke 24 ghante kaise guzare, ye yaa to khud asaram jaanate hai yaa phir un par nazar rakhanevaale jail ke mulajim
 All the happiness of Asaram, who told people the recipe to be happy due to meditation and devotion, had evaporated in one night
 asaram ke thaath-baat kii jail main nikali hawaasaram ke thaath-baat, shaano-shaukat, aisho aaraam, sabaki hawa nikal chuki he
 Baba who drank gold in milk, Baba snacking milk almonds, Baba eating delicious and good food, Baba who used to eat fatigue on velvet beds, Baba playing the game of pranks in the guise of discourses and faith It was gone jail kii charadivari main barrack number ek main asaram kaidi bane to jailer bhi sakht or kanoon bhi sakht
 As soon as Asaram Bapu entered the Jodhpur jail, the jailor added a jail menu to Baba's life
 vaise asaram ne do din main hi satya ko sweekaar kar liya he
 Also adopted prison bread
 jail main abhi bahut din baaki hai
 Baba, tired of three days, got an opportunity to rest and sleep a little
 lekin abhi dagar jail kii mushkil hai, baba ko jail ke kanoon ke niyam kaayadon ke mutabik apane bartan khud dhone honge, khaanaa baaki kaidiyon kii line main lagakar hi lenaa hoga
 Breakfast is fixed in the morning
 gud chanaa naashte main milegaa
 Time to eat at 2 in the afternoon is also ready
 daal, roti ke saath sabzi milegi
 a tea at 5 in the evening and at 8 o'clock at night, then the same lentils, roti and vegetables
 kaise gujri jail main ratasomvaar yani 2 sitambar ko shaam paune paanch baje asaram jail pahunche or baba ko jodhpur central jail kii barrack number ek main bhej diya gaya
 The same barracks in which Salman Khan and Mahipal Maderna have also lived
 jail ke niyam ke hisaab se asaram kii jaanch hui
 After a while, Asaram goes to jail for a walk
 chehre par shikan or udati hawaayiyon ke bich raat ke khaane kaa vakt ho gaya or baba ne ashram ke khaane kii khwaahish jataai
 The first day was the jailer agreed and Asaram ate his delicious meal and went to sleep at 10 in the night
 lekin baba ko raatbhar neend nahin aayi
 The windows of the eyes remained open overnight and became dawn
 raat main uth uthakar 3-4 baar pani piya
 Baba's barracks opened and started walking in the jail itself
 kaidiyon se mulaakaat karne lage
 What a prisoner said to Asaram, 'baba you look like Osho in a red cap'
 baba ne kaha- sahi kah rahe ho osho ko bhi to jail janaa padaa tha
 Asaram was given jaggery and gram at breakfast at 7 in the morning
 lekin baba ne gud or chanaa khaane se manaa kar diya or jail kii dispenceri number 12 kii taraf jaakar akhbaar dekhne lage
 11 in the morning
 30 baje ke aas-paas asaram ne khaanaa khaaya
 But not of the ashram but of the jail
 lajiz nahin balki daal-roti or sabzi or uske baad baba asaram karne ke liye chale gaye or der kar kharrate bharte rahe
 Asaram, who was sleeping peacefully on the velvet bed, got windy as he went to jail
 barrack kii sakht khaat ne naa to unhen sone laayak choda or naa hi machharon ke dank ne jaagane laayak
 The situation was that it was better to spend time reading the Gita than to lay down Asaram
 jail jate hi hawa hui asaram kii neendbaba kii zindagi ne aisa you turn liya ki jodhpur jail main sukun se so bhi naa sake
 Kaidi Baba went out counting the links of barracks overnight
 ankhon kii palken jhapakna bhul gayi
 Sometimes this side, sometimes that side
 neend kis bhalaa kaa naam he, wo to udati chidiyaaki tarah furr ho gai
 Asaram must have been haunting the same dream throughout the night
 14 din jail main kaise katenge
 Which decree will the jailer forward
 tabhi to raatbhar karavatein badalte rahe baapu
 Asaram, whose water did not descend from the Ganges water around his neck

 Asaram's bedtime was fixed
 baba kehete the ki wo zyaada der tak nahin jagate
 Now the sleeping time is fixed according to the jail
 subah 8 baje uthne vaale asaram ko ankhen bhi jail ke niyamon ke hisaab se kholani hongi
 The velvet beds on which Asaram used to sleep
 ab wo khwaabon main aa rahe honge
 Because Asaram is given a bed, a carriage and a blanket to sleep in the jail
 bataaya jaataa he ki asaram ko raat bhar machharon ne bhi khub sataaya
 In Barrack number one, the mosquitoes did not even know who took revenge for their birth from Baba
 sutron ke mutabik asaram ne pehali raat jail prashasan se mannath kii, jiske baad unhen dispenceri ke bed par sulaayaa gayalekin yahaan asaram ko sukun nahin mila
 Here he kept complaining of the stench all night, and kept reading the Gita from his bag
 asaram ko mila jail kaa ekantavasbar baar asaram agyatavaas kaa hawala dete rahe
 People kept the police waiting for their confinement and kept them waiting for long
 ab asaram ko aisa ekantavaas mila he ki khatm bhi 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat ke baad hoga
 Even after this, the charges are left standing
 adaalat he, police kii chargeshit he
 Of course, all the presumption of this self-proclaimed god of devotion to be above the law has been destroyed

 html All the bodies killed by ISIS in Iraq reached India on Monday
 inamen 27 sirf punjab ke hai, lekin gurdaspur ke rooponvali gaanv ke kamaljit kii kahani sunakar har kisi kii ruh kaanp jaaegi
 Among the 39 Indians killed at the hands of militants in Iraq, the remains of five youth belonging to district Gurdaspur were cremated in their native villages
 magar jila gurdaspur ke gaanv rooponvali se sambandhit kamaljit kii kahani badi dukhabhari he
 Because while living neither Kamaljeet was able to see his daughter nor did Kamaljeet's daughter Hargun see her father
 paanch saal baad jab kamaljit kaa avshesh gaanv aayaa to dukhabhraa pal tha
 Harpreet Kaur, wife of the deceased Kamaljeet, told in a sad atmosphere that she was pregnant when her husband went to Iraq
 kamaljit ke jane ke baad usne beti hargun ko janm diya, lekin na to baap beti ko dekh paaya or na hi beti apane baap ko dekh pai
 The wife said that when the daughter grew up, she used to ask about her father all the time and we used to assure her that the father would come back soon, but now that hope has been broken
 vahiin kamaljit ke pita harbhajan singh ne kaha ki vah nathin main ab apane bete ko dekhte he
 Now, with the help of that, we will spend the rest of our lives
 pita ne kaha ki bete se ummid thi ki vah unke budhaape kaa saathi banegaa, lekin vah baat sach nahin ho pai

 Among the Rajput kings, the Jat Maharaja alone, who has been counted in the history of heroes, is Jat king Surajmal
 swatantra hindu rajya banane kaa sapana dekhne vaala ye raja kabhi mughalon ke saamne nahin jhukaa
 The film Panipat is being opposed in haryana-rajasthan only with this king, who along with the Marathas, lured the Mughals to dust
 kaha ja rahaa he ye film raja surajmal ke jivan se hi prerit he
 Let's know - these facts related to this king
 maharaja surajmal kaa janm aurangzeb kii maut vaale din 13 farvari 1707 ko hua
 His father Raja Badansingh raised him
 raja surajmal ko hi bharatpur riyasat kii neenv rakhane kaa shrey jaataa he
 Which is today known as Bharatpur city of Rajasthan
 saal 1733 main bharatpur riyasat kii sthapana kii thi
 The flag hoisted up to Ferozeshah Kotla By 1753, Maharaja Suraj Mal had extended his kingship to Delhi and Ferozeshah Kotla
 is baat se khafa dilli ke nawab gajiuddin ne surajmal ke khilaaf maratha saradaaron ko bhadakaayaa or maraathon ne bharatpur par chadhaai kar di
 He surrounded the fort of Kumher for several months
 bataate hai ki akraman ke baavjood maratha bharatpur par kabja nahin jamaa sake
 Khanderao Holkar, son of Maratha Sardar Malharrao, died in a reverse attack
 lekin itihaas is baat kaa bhi gavaah he ki maraathon ne surajmal se sandhi kar lee thi
 It is said that Surajmal built the impregnable Lohagad fort in Bharatpur, which even after attacking 13 times, the British could not move
 mitti ke bane is kile kii deevaaren itani moti banaai gai thim ki top ke mote-mote gole bhi inhen kabhi paar nahin kar paae
 It is the only fort in the country, which has always been impregnable
 is raja ke kaaran hi us dauraan jat shakti charam par rahi
 According to history, according to history, the Marathas fought Ahmad Shah Abdali in the third war of Panipat
 is yuddh main hajaaron maratha yoddha maare gaye
 The Marathas had also exhausted the logistics
 maraathon ke sambandh agar surajmal se kharaab na hue hote, to is yuddh main unki yah haalat na hoti
 In spite of this, Surajmal, while showing his humanity, made arrangements for medical and food for the injured Maratha soldiers
 maharaja surajmal 25 disambar 1763 ko nawab najibuddaula ke saath hindon nadi ke tat par ladate hue veergati ko praapt hue
 This is why the protest film Panipat is being accused of showing the character of Maharaja Surajmal wrongly
 ise lekar rajasthan main virodh ho rahaa he
 Historians are arguing that Surajmal suggested keeping the women and children with the Maratha army in safe places in the fort of Gwalior, Deeg and Kumher
 lekin, unke paraamarsh ko nahin mana gaya or upeksha kii gai, is par ve alag ho gaye
 At the same time, Tourism Minister Vishwendrasinh, a descendant of Maharaja Surajmal's 14th generation, has also demanded a ban on the film
 unka kahana he ki peshwa or maratha jab panipat yuddh main ghayal hokar laut rahe the to maharaja surajmal or maharani kishori ne 6 maah tak maratha sena or peshwaon ko panaah di thi
 The police arrested Congress MLA Nitesh Rane on Tuesday for allegedly throwing fish at a senior government employee during a meeting last week

 a case has been registered against the government officer who is on duty, under criminal force, criminal intimidation and other sections
 sthaneey samachar channel par prasaarit video main dikhaaya gaya he ki chah july ko rane sindhudurg jile ke matsay ayukta se unke karyaalay main logon ke samaksh baat kar rahe hai
 In a meeting called to discuss the problems of fishermen, the MLA lost his temper and picked up the fish on the commissioner's table and threw it at him
 sindhudurg jile ke kaanakawali se vidhayak rane ne phir kaha ki unhone konkan kshetra ke paaramparik machuaaraa samudaay ke prati adhikari ke laaparvaah ravaiye ke virodh main aisa kiya

 ) unke khilaaf duty kar rahe sarkari afasar par aapraadhik bal prayog, aapraadhik dhamkee or anya dhaaraon main maamla darj kiya gaya he
 In a video broadcast on the local news channel, on July 6, Rane is talking to the fisheries commissioner of Sindhudurg district in front of people in his office
 machuaaron kii samasyaon par charchaa ke liye bulaayi gayi baithak main vidhayak ne apana aapa kho diya or ayukta ke teble par rakhi machhlee uthaakar un par phenk di
 Rane, an MLA from Kankavali in Sindhudurg district, again said that he did so in protest against the officer's reckless attitude towards the traditional fishermen community of the Konkan region

 The CJM court has reserved its decision on whether the plea of the lawyer will be accepted for hearing
 ye mukadmaa aapraadhik dand samhita (siarpisi) kii dhara 200 ke tahat darj kiya gaya he
 Civil court lawyer Shiv Kumar Shukla in Barabanki was so upset that he did not get the money even after a long queue at the bank that filed a case against the Prime Minister
 shukla ne mukademe kii arji main likhaa ki jinke khilaaf (pradhanmantri narendra modi) shikaayat he unke ati shaktishaalee hone kii vajah se kotwali barabanki meneiaardarj nahin kii gai
 Shukla also wrote that his account is in Dena Bank, despite the guidelines, the proper money is not in the bank
 isaki vajah se wo apana paisa hi nahin nikaal paa rahe hai
 According to Shukla, this is a crime of Khayanat in Amanat

 Even if you are getting it, then of course

 Now it's Pixel 4's turn
 benchmark website gikabench par sambhavit Google Pixel 4 list kiya gaya he
 Earlier, smartphone information from codename Sargo was recorded in the listing
 haalanki ise bataaya gaya ki yah Google Pixel 3 Lite he or yah mid range smartphone hoga
 Google Pixel 3 Lite can be given 2GB RAM and will have Android 10 operating system
 is listing ke mutabik iskaa single kor rigelt 744 he, jabaki multicor score 3201 he
 Although it does not have the information of the processor
 lekin spacifications dekh kar lagata he ye mid range picksal hoga
 a phone has been entered on the Geekbench listing with the Bonito codename being described as Google Pixel 3a XL
 iske baad taaja listing ke mutabik Sargo kodenem vaale smartphone ko Google Pixel 4 kaha jayega
 In the name of the specifications, it is currently reported that 2 GB of RAM will be given in one of its variants and obviously Android 10 / Android q will be given in it
 lekin gikabench kii is listing par agar yakeen bhi karen to Pixel 4 main sirf 2GB ram hogi is par vishwaas karnaa mushkil jarur he
 It is possible that this will be a prototype and later improvements will be made
 ek fact ye bhi he ki google kii smartphone ko lekar ek alag chhavi he
 On one hand, smartphone companies are bringing four rear camera smartphones
 lekin google ne Pixel 3 main bhi sirf ek rier camera diya he or yah duusare chaar camere vaale smartphone par baari padaa he
 The company is the master in terms of software
 isliye is sambhaavna se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is baar google kam ram vaala smartphone lo kar 10GB ram vaale flagship ko takkar de? jaisaa abhi he—single camere se Pixel 3 kai flagship ko takkar detaa he jisamen ek yaa do nahin balki chaar camere hote hai

 Other parties are also not washed by milk

 Aaj Tak organized a 'security meeting' on the issue of national security following the Pulwama terror attack and India's air strike, in which the veteran leaders of the government and opposition participated

 During this time, the two leaders put forward their parties and spoke on a number of issues related to national security
 chunaav kii vajah se hi kya sena ke shaury par siyaayat kii ja rahi he
 In response to this question, Congress leader and former Union Minister Manish Tiwari said that the death toll of the terrorists in Balakot was not asked by anyone, but the BJP President said in the election rally itself that 250-300 terrorists have been killed
 vaayu sena ne aatankiyon ke maare jane par ajtak koi aankade jari nahin kiye hai
 The national security has not been politicized by the opposition but by the government and the ruling party
 tiwari ne kaha ki loktantr main rashtriya suraksha ek raajnneetik sawaal he lekin is par siyasat nahin honi chahie
 On allowing the army to retaliate after the Mumbai attack, a major terrorist attack in the NDA government, Manish Tiwari said that the Congress government had not left Masood Azhar leaving Kandahar
 yah kaam endie or bijepi kii sarkaar ne hi kiya tha
 He said that there was a hijack in 1984 when terrorism was at a peak in Punjab, then our government had worked to bring all passengers safely and no terrorists were released
 desh main do baar loktantr ke mandir par hamalaa hua, ek sansad bhawan par duusari baar jammu kashmir kii vidhansabha par, donon baar hi bijepi kii hi sarkaar thi
 Targeting terrorism government will not end, Manish Tiwari said that demonetisation was said to end terrorism, but after this, the government said that surgical strike will end terrorism, now saying that Balakot strike should end terrorism Will go
 tiwari ne kaha ki aatank ko jawaab dena jaruri he or dena bhi chahie lekin aap agar yah maanate hai ki air strike se aatankwaad khatm ho jayega to aap galat hai, kyonki aatankwaad khatm hone vaala nahin he
 Explaining the reason for this, Manish Tiwari said that Pakistan uses terrorism under state policy
 aatankwaad kii bahes ko sankeern banane kaa kaam bijepi kar rahi he
 Action on terror will continue: On the issue of national security, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the country's security is paramount and it has nothing to do with elections
 chunaav ho yaa nahin ho, kisi bhi paristhiti main suraksha ke samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said that the entire nation is saluting the might of the soldiers
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki desh kii suraksha ko majboot karnaa agar sarkaar kaa agenda he to isamen kisi prakaar kii raajnneeti nahin he
 Prakash Javadekar said that Pakistan is pursuing terrorism and that is why we did not go to the border this time but entered into Pakistan and targeted the factory of terrorists
 unhone kaha ki pakistan kii aadat badalane vaali nahin he or isliye aatankwaad par karrwai aage bhi jari rahegi
 Taking a dig at the national security, senior Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that there is a need to understand national security
 desh majboot tab hoga jab naujavaanon ke haathon main kaam ho, aatank or bhay kaa maahaul na ho, desh shashaktikaran kii disha main aage bade, in sabhi ko milakar rashtriya suraksha kaa mudda banataa he
 Tiwari said that we have no objection to the government's air strike after the Pulwama attack, we have objections to its politicization

 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke saath hi sabhi dal muslim samudaay ko rijhaane main jute gaye hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav may soon make a big announcement in this regard
 sapa main mulaayam kheme ke sutron kii maane to mulaayam ne akhilesh ko karaara jawaab dete hue unke hi kareebi or upra sarkaar ke cabinet mantri ajam khan ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa ghoshit karne kaa man bana liya he
 It may be announced soon
 sapa or shivpal yadav ke ek kareebi netaa ne naam na jaahir karne kii shart par ieenes ko bataaya ki vidhansabha chunaav main musalamaanon ko apane paale main karne ke liye mulaayam singh yadav muslim chehre ajam khan ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav have also given their consent in his name
 sab kuch thik-thaak rahaa to jald hi iskaa elaan ho saktaa he
 Sources also state that although it is difficult for Azam to enter the Mulayam camp while Amar Singh, Mulayam himself has spoken to Azam
 unhone kaha he ki vah ajam ko khud hi manaayenge
 Senior SP leader said that Azam and Mulayam may meet soon in this regard and they can be declared the face of CM
 ajam khan kai baar kah chuke hai ki mulaayam singh hi sachche myne main musalamaanon ke rahanuma hai or upra main sampradayik takaton ko vahi satta se dur rakh sakate hai
 Azam Khan also became a mediator for reconciliation between Mulayam and Akhilesh, but his efforts did not yield any results
 philhal ab sabaki nigahen nirvachan ayog ke samaajawaadee party se jude faisle par he
 a formal announcement can be made only after the decision of the Commission
 ajam khan samaajawaadee party main ek bada muslim cheharaa hai
 This is the reason why the Mulayam camp is trying to get 19 percent Muslim votes in its court by making them its chief ministerial face
 party se jude kai alpsankhyak sanghathan bhi muslim mukhyamantri cheharaa utaarne kii maang kar chuke hai
 If this happens, there will definitely be a split in the Muslim vote and Akhilesh may have to bear the loss
 vidhansabha chunaav main muslim matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye mayawati ne 97 musalamaanon ko tikat de diya he
 Now Mulayam may try this to cut Mayawati's bet and teach Akhilesh a lesson
 tippaniyan (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) a close leader of the SP and Shivpal Yadav told IANS on the condition of anonymity that Mulayam Singh Yadav is considering making Muslim face Azam Khan the chief ministerial candidate to elect Muslims to his side in the assembly elections
 amar singh va shivpal yadav ne bhi unke naam par apni sahmati de di he
 If everything goes well, it can be announced soon
 sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki haalanki amar singh ke rahete hue ajam ke liye mulaayam kheme main janaa mushkil he, lekin mulaayam ne khud ajam se baat karne kii baat kahi he
 He has said that he will celebrate Azam himself
 sapa ke varisht netaa ne bataaya ki is silsile main jald hi ajam or mulaayam kii mulaakaat ho sakati he or unhen siem kaa cheharaa ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Azam Khan has said many times that Mulayam Singh is the true leader of Muslims and can keep communal forces away from power in UP
 ajam khan, mulaayam or akhilesh ke bich sulah karaane ke liye madhyasth bhi bane, lekin unki koshishon kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Right now, everyone's eyes are on the Election Commission's decision related to Samajwadi Party
 ayog ke faisle ke baad hi is bare main aupchaarik elaan ho saktaa he
 Azam Khan is a big Muslim face in the Samajwadi Party
 yahi vajah he ki mulaayam khemaa unhen apana mukhyamantri cheharaa banaakar 19 fisadi muslim vot apane paale main karne kii firaaq main he
 Several minority organizations associated with the party have also demanded the face of the Muslim chief minister
 aisa hone par nishchit rup se muslim vot main bikharaav hoga or iskaa nuksaan akhilesh ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 To woo Muslim voters in the assembly elections, Mayawati has given tickets to 97 Muslims
 ab mayawati ke is daanv ko kaatane ke liye or akhilesh ko sabak sikhaane ke iraade se mulaayam yah daanv aajamaa sakate hai
 The comments (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) sutara yah bhi bataate hai ki haalanki amar singh ke rahete hue ajam ke liye mulaayam kheme main janaa mushkil he, lekin mulaayam ne khud ajam se baat karne kii baat kahi he
 He has said that he will celebrate Azam himself
 sapa ke varisht netaa ne bataaya ki is silsile main jald hi ajam or mulaayam kii mulaakaat ho sakati he or unhen siem kaa cheharaa ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Azam Khan has said many times that Mulayam Singh is the true leader of Muslims and can keep communal forces away from power in UP
 ajam khan, mulaayam or akhilesh ke bich sulah karaane ke liye madhyasth bhi bane, lekin unki koshishon kaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Right now, everyone's eyes are on the Election Commission's decision related to Samajwadi Party
 ayog ke faisle ke baad hi is bare main aupchaarik elaan ho saktaa he
 Azam Khan is a big Muslim face in the Samajwadi Party
 yahi vajah he ki mulaayam khemaa unhen apana mukhyamantri cheharaa banaakar 19 fisadi muslim vot apane paale main karne kii firaaq main he
 Several minority organizations associated with the party have also demanded the face of the Muslim chief minister
 aisa hone par nishchit rup se muslim vot main bikharaav hoga or iskaa nuksaan akhilesh ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 To woo Muslim voters in the assembly elections, Mayawati has given tickets to 97 Muslims
 ab mayawati ke is daanv ko kaatane ke liye or akhilesh ko sabak sikhaane ke iraade se mulaayam yah daanv aajamaa sakate hai
 The comments (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) ajam khan kai baar kah chuke hai ki mulaayam singh hi sachche myne main musalamaanon ke rahanuma hai or upra main sampradayik takaton ko vahi satta se dur rakh sakate hai
 Azam Khan also became a mediator for reconciliation between Mulayam and Akhilesh, but his efforts did not yield any results
 philhal ab sabaki nigahen nirvachan ayog ke samaajawaadee party se jude faisle par he
 a formal announcement can be made only after the decision of the Commission
 ajam khan samaajawaadee party main ek bada muslim cheharaa hai
 This is the reason why the Mulayam camp is trying to get 19 percent Muslim votes in its court by making them its chief ministerial face
 party se jude kai alpsankhyak sanghathan bhi muslim mukhyamantri cheharaa utaarne kii maang kar chuke hai
 If this happens, there will definitely be a split in the Muslim vote and Akhilesh may have to bear the loss
 vidhansabha chunaav main muslim matadaataaon ko rijhaane ke liye mayawati ne 97 musalamaanon ko tikat de diya he
 Now Mulayam may try this to cut Mayawati's bet and teach Akhilesh a lesson

 bihar ke musalamaanon ke sabase bade sanghathan imaarat e sharia ne pichley dinon 'deen bachaao desh bachaao' kaarykram kiya tha
 Millions of Muslims were united in Patna's Gandhi Maidan
 muslim ulimaon ne sampradayikta ke naam par jamkar piem narendra modi ko kosa or musalamaanon kii samasya ke liye bijepi ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 The Nitish government had allocated Rs 40 lakh for this program
 bihar ke patna ke gandhi maidan main ravivaar ko 'deen bachaao desh bachaao' kaarykram ke liye nitish sarkaar dwaara aavantit kiye gaye raashi kaa patr ajtak ke paas he
 In this letter, Radha Nandan Prasad, the Under Secretary of the Government of Bihar, allocated Rs 40 lakh
 ye dhan patna ke jila adhikari ko die gaye the
 The cost of this money was allocated for crowd management, law and order and facilities of people coming to the 'din Bachao Desh Bachao' rally
 'deen bachaao desh bachaao'kaarykram kaa ayojan imaarat e sharia ne kiya tha
 JDU has been accused of organizing JDU from the beginning by the Muslims of the state
 ye baat tab or pukhta ho gai jab kaarykram ke manch se bijepi ko jahaan kosa gaya vahiin jediu kii tarif kii gai
 Nitish Kumar was thanked for his support for the program
 itnaa hi nahin is baat par tab muhar lag gai jab kaarykram kaa tambu bhi nahin ukhda tha ki 'deen bachaao desh bachaao' ke kanvener khalid anwar ko nitish kumaar ne emelsi ke tohfe se navaj diya
 It is worth mentioning that Imrat a Sharia and JDUK are well known
 jediu ke nitish kumaar kaa argedy se naata todakar bijepi sang dobaaraa janaa bihar ke musalamaanon ko hajam nahin ho rahaa he
 Due to this, the Muslim was seen going with the RJD
 isi ke chalate jediu netaaon ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bani hui thi
 In view of this, JDU weaved a sarcasm of the Deen Bachao Desh Bachao program
 isi ke chalate jediu se jude log kaarykram ko safal banane ke liye din raat ek kiye hue the
 JDU leaders had also put up hoardings and posters for the rally, urging Muslims to reach lakhs of people in Gandhi Maidan
 raily ke peeche jediu ke hone kii us samay hakeekat sabit hui jab kaarykram ke baad hi nitish kumaar ne deen bachaao desh bachaao ke kanvener khalid anwar ko emelsi banane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The anger of the Muslims of Bihar started coming to the fore when MLC was created
 rajya main kai jilon main moulana vali rahamaani sahit kaarykram se jude hue logon ke khilaaf musalamaanon ne saudebaaji kaa iljaam lagaate hue virodh pradarshan kiya
 a video of Anisur Rahman Kasami, the president of Bhawan a Sharia, has also surfaced
 iske tahat kaasmi saaf taur par kehete dikh rahe hai ki is kaarykram kaa makasad hi raajnneetik tha
 However, the purpose of the program was to alert the people against the forces standing against hindu-muslim harmony and brotherhood
 par ulema apni raajnneetik roti senkane se baj nahin aae
 That is why the Muslims of Bihar feel cheated in the program of 'deen Bachao Desh Bachao'

 There is no use in being worried about budget
 aam logon ke bajet (kharch) ko banane yaa bigaadpee vaala bajet ab sansad ke baahar jiesti council main banataa he
 Actually, if anyone needs to be worried about the budget, it is the Parliament itself

 The entire process of tax on consumption is now out of the control of Parliament-legislatures
 jiesti kanoon ko manjuuri dene ke baad janata ke chune hue numaayindon ne indirect tex par niyantran ganvaa diya
 The GST Council is not a Parliament
 yahaan do darjan mantri milakar har maheene tex kii daren badal dete hai
 What is the logic of these changes? Who benefits from this? Why is the discussion in the GST Council not public? How much does the GST Council stand for representation to impose tax? What will be the role of Parliament and CAG in relation to GST? Parliament and legislatures should discuss these questions

 In the last three years, on the financial decisions, money bill (lok Sabha only) has been used a lot to cut off Kanni from Rajya Sabha
 gambhir vittiya faislon main ab puri sansad bhi shaamil nahin hoti
 After liberalization, the role of Parliament should be increased for transparency in economic decisions but
 
 
 swadeshi ko lekar aasmaan sir par uthaane vaale kya kabhi poochna chahenge ki videshi nivesh ke udaarikaran ke faislon main sansad kii kya bhoomika he, in faislon ko sansad kabhi parakhti kyon nahin he
 International investment, trade and tax concession treaties do not even see the face of Parliament
 vishwa ke kai deshon main in par sansad kii manjuuri lee jaati he
 When this is the condition of the role of Parliament in economic decisions, what will be the position of legislatures? When the government does not need to ask the Parliament for spending more than one-third of the Union budget, and one-third of the revenue to be taxed or changed outside the Parliament, then they should worry which in the democracy Vows to be omnipotent

 Fazlur Rahman opened a new crisis against the government of Imran Khan in Pakistan
 He also opposed the government against Musharraf
 There is an old saying in Pakistan that if you want to come to power or stay, then 'allah-army and America' head on It is necessary
 sankat main ghire pakistan main aajkal ye teenon factor cricketer se rajaneta or phir pradhanmantri bane imran khan ke khilaaf jate dikh rahe hai
 From the economy to the foreign policy front, Imran Khan is all-round, while the army chief Bajwa has run the parallel government and has indicated that the justification of the military coup is just left
 to vahiin america bhi china ke prati pakistani jhukaav ke chalate koi khush nahin he or pichley kuch saalon main tamaam tarah ke bain laga chukaa he
 But among all this, the biggest hit on Imran's government is that of 'maulana Factor'
 ham baat kar rahe hai moulana fajalur rahamaan kii
 The 66-year-old Maulana this month, from the economy of Islamabad to the foreign policy front, Imran Khan is all-round, while the army chief Bajwa has run the parallel government and has indicated that the justification of the military coup is just left
 to vahiin america bhi china ke prati pakistani jhukaav ke chalate koi khush nahin he or pichley kuch saalon main tamaam tarah ke bain laga chukaa he
 Has declared independence march
 or tabatak jari rakhane kaa elaan kiya he jabatak imran khan sarkaar ko ukhaad nahin phenkate
 This independence march of Maulana is getting the support of all parties including PML-N, PPP, Muslim league-noon
 kyonki mahangaai se trast pakistan kii janata main imran khan ko lekar jari asantosh ko bhunaane kaa bada mauka isamen dikh rahaa he
 Who is Maulana Fazlur Rahman? Maulana Fazlur Rahman is the chief of Pakistan's largest religious party and Sunni fundamentalist party Jamiat ulema-e-islam (JUI-F)
 unke pita khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa praant ke siem rah chuke hai
 His family has been a major influence in the politics there
 moulana pakistan kii neshnal assembly main netaa vipaksh bhi rah chuke hai
 He has been the Chief of the Standing Committee on Foreign Policy, Head of Kashmir Committee in Parliament
 ve taliban samarthak maane jate hai lekin pichley kuch saal se udaaravaadi hone kaa daawa karte hai
 Apart from this, after the 2018 elections, he came into the limelight by taking a joint initiative to stop Imran from coming to power
 pichley saal raashtrapati chunaav main vipaksh kii ore se ummidavaar bhi the
 Despite not being in power, Nawaz Sharif's government had given Maulana the status of Union Minister
 dharmik card or taliban conectionmoulana kaa dharmik card sabase majboot rahaa he
 They openly run the largest religious party in the country
 kabhi taliban ke khilaaf america abhiyaan ko islam virdohi bataakar ve jehad kaa elaan kiya karte the
 For the first time in 1988, when Benazir Bhutto became Prime Minister of Pakistan, Maulana opened a front against a woman leading the country
 haalanki baad main benazir bhutto se mulaakaat ke baad moulana ne apana virodh waapas le liya tha
 Secret Dinner against Musharraf Even during the rule of Musharraf, Maulana Fazlur Rahman always raised the flag of protest
 2001 main america main hue 9 / 11 ke hamale ke baad jab pakistan ko majabuuran taliban ke khilaaf america oparation main saath hona padaa to moulana ne musharraf ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Announced jihad against George Bush and rallied in favor of Taliban in many cities of Pakistan
 parvej musharraf ne tab moulana ko najarband bhi karvaa diya tha
 Later revelations from leaked American cables also revealed that in 2007, as part of his plan to overthrow Musharraf's power, Maulana called the US ambassador at a secret dinner to seek US support to become PM
 dinar main moulana ne ofer kiya tha ki taliban kaa samarthan chhod ve pakistan kaa piem bananaa chaahate hai or america kii yatra karnaa chaahate hai
 This was a period when Musharraf's power was weakening and all parties were trying to make a place for themselves on the political scene
 tab moulana ne america samarthan hasil kar satta par kabje kaa sikret plan banaaya tha
 Why raid Emraan? In the 2018 elections, Imran Khan came to power at the mercy of the army without winning a majority, and calls those elections as Maulana Fazlur Rahman rigged election
 chunaav ke samay se hi moulana ne imran khan ke khilaaf morcha khol rakhaa he
 Trying to form a joint opposition government first, then opposition mobilization in the presidential election and now the declaration of independence march
 
 
 moulana ek taraf jahaan ek saal main pakistan main nasoor ban chuke aarthik sankat kaa kaaran imran khan kii nitiyon ko bataate hai vahiin nae sire se chunaav karakar nai sarkaar ke gathan kii maang par ade hue hai
 Maulana Fazlur Rahman has announced the Islamabad march from October 27, against the independence march
 moulana ne kaha ki sabhi kaaryakarta islamabad ke di-chowk par jamaa honge or imran sarkaar ke khatme tak hamaara virodh jari rahegaa
 Pakistan's two major opposition parties Nawaz Sharif's PML-N and Bilawal Bhutto's PPP have announced its support
 iske alaava tamaam or dal bhi ise samarthan ko taiyaar hai
 Seeing the preparations of Maulana, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has meanwhile instructed his party PTI to open the way for talks with Maulana
 is march ko lekar pakistan kii rajdhani islamabad ke logon ko 2014 kaa wo manjar bhi yaad aa rahaa he jab vipakshi netaa ke rup main imran khan march lekar islamabad pahunche the or puraa shahar jaise ast-vyast ho gaya tha
 Now it will be decided in the coming days that to what extent does this march of Maulana create a stir in the politics of Pakistan
