 Renowned filmmaker Anand Patwardhan has said that his national award-winning documentary 'ram Ke Naam', based on the Babri Masjid demolition, has been imposed on youtube
 nirdeshak ne kaha ki video saajha karne vaali website un ‘‘hindutvvaadi gudon ko dhyaan main rakh rahi he, jo sabhi dharmanirpeksh saamagree ko khatm kar dena chaahate hai''
 This 1992 documentary explores the Hindu nationalist Vishwa Hindu Parishad's campaign for the construction of a Ram temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, as well as the communal violence that has erupted
 documentry ko us vakt kendriya film pramann beuro se ‘you' certificate mila tha or 1996 main ucch nyaayalay se iske prasaaran kii anumati milane ke baad use doordarshan ke prime time par dikhaaya gaya tha
 Patwardhan said that he was surprised that after 28 years of its release, it is now being described as worthy of being shown only to "adults"

 Patwardhan said that he was surprised that 28 years after the release of this Babri Masjid-related film, it is now being described as worthy of being shown only to "adults"

 The latest example of this is that my film, which has received the certificate 'U' (for all ages) from CBFC, has put an 'age limit' to see my same film 'ram Ke Naam'
 ''filmkaar ne kaha ki video saajha karne vaali website ne isse pehle ‘jai bhim kamred' ke saath bhi aisa hi kiya tha jabaki is film ko bhi ‘you' praaanpatr mila tha jo yah sawaal khadaa karata he ki kya utyub hamaari sibiefasi se bhi bura he? patavardhan ne kaha ki is website par hindutv kaa prabhaav he
 He called this move of the website disgusting
 unhone kaha, ‘‘agar aap 14 saal se adhik or 18 saal se kam umr ke bachche hai to aapako kai mushkil bhare kaam karne kii anumati he lekin aap ‘ram ke naam' ko nahin dekh sakate hai
 The little good news at the moment is that if you are over 18 years old then you can watch this film of mine on youtube channel until they think of new tricks to ban this film further '' youtube Wrote a letter to which the video-sharing website replied that the film 'ram Ke Naam' was reviewed, on the basis of which he decided that it was not suitable for audiences of all ages
 Be programmed and therefore it is applied age limits drawn look
 '' patavardhan ne utyub kaa jawaab bhi apane post ke saath saajha kiya he
 In response to youtube, "after a re-review, we came to the conclusion that your videos do not violate our Community Guidelines, but these videos may not be suitable for general audiences
" isliye hamane aapke video par umr seemaa lagaayi he

 unhone kaha ki yah swaabhaavik rup se ho jayega
 He said that the economy doubles every 6-7 years, it is simple mathematics, what is the big deal in it

 During the discussion on the budget in the Rajya Sabha, Chidambaram said, 'the size of the Indian economy was $ 325 billion in 1991, it doubled to $ 618 billion in the year 2003-04
 agle chaar saal main yah phir dabl ho gaya 1
 Up to 22 trillion dollars

 Up to $ 48 trillion
 yah phir dabl ho jayega agle paanch saal main
 No Prime Minister or Finance Minister is needed for this
 yah koi saadhaaran sahuukaar bhi jaanata hoga
 What's the big deal? 'unhone kaha ki nominal jidipi growth 12 fisadi ke aasapaas he, isliye isamen koi achraj kii baat nahin he ki agle paanch saal main arthvyavastha 5 trillian dollar kaa aakaar chhu le
 He said that even more, the economy is weak

 There is no way in the budget to increase people's savings
 Former Finance Minister and senior Congress leader p Chidambaram said that there is no way to increase the savings of people in this budget, then how will there be development
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ne nivesh or niryaat ko vikaas ke liye sabase jaruri bataaya he
 But you have not taken any measures in this budget to save families and this is going to cause great harm to the middle class
 agar pariwaron main bachat nahin badhegi to gharelu bachat ko aap kaise badhayenge
 If domestic savings do not increase, then domestic investment will not increase, then where will you get 8 percent growth rate?

 On the recommendation of NITI Aayog, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has prepared a list of 92 cpses for disinvestment this year
 is prakriya main yah prastaav rakhaa gaya he ki kuch companiyon main 'ranneetik hissedari' bechi jaae or kuch companiyon kaa asset bechaa jaae
 The three wholly owned subsidiaries of Air India, Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL), Air India Engineered Services Limited (AIESL) and Alliance Air Services Limited (AASL) have been re-placed in the disinvestment list

 On the issue of Arvind Kejriwal, who has exposed one scandal after another on the issue of corruption, former Army Chief VK Singh said that he is with everyone who works against corruption and for the benefit of the country but Arvind Kejriwal who fight He (general Singh) has nothing to do with it
 aravind kejariwal or unki raahen bilkul alag-alag hai or unki aravind kejariwal ke saath koi baatcheet bhi nahin he
 In fact, General VK Singh had come to unveil the statue of two soldiers killed in the 1971 battle at Ghamdoz village in Gurgaon
 yahaan par unhone shaheedon kii viranganaon ko bhi sammanit kiya or deshhit kii kai baaten to kii lekin aravind kejariwal ke mudde par kataaksh karte najar aae
 The comments singh ne kaha kii jahaan duusare desho main shaheedon ke sammaan main jagah-jagah smarak bane hue hai vahiin, gudgaanv main sirf pratham vishwa yuddh ke baad dilli main india get banaaya gaya tha jiske baad aaj tak aisa koi samaarak nahin banaaya gaya he jisase desh ke shaheedon ko sammaan mil sake
 This is the reason that today the trend towards the army is becoming less in the youth and today the youth do not show interest in the army
 saath hi van rank van pension kaa jo mudda uthaaya tha usame bhi sarkaar ne sainikon ke saath chhalaava kiya he jo ki kaaphi galat he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who raised his own team against the government on the issue of corruption and Jan Lokpal, is constantly making revelations one after the other, while VK Singh has kept away from Arvind Kejriwal by saying that he should work in public interest and walk separately from Arvind Kejriwal

 Here, he also honored the martyrs of the martyrs and did many things for the benefit of the country but Arvind was seen sarcasm on Kejriwal's issue
 tippaniyan Singh said that while memorials have been built in honor of martyrs in other countries, India Gate was built in Delhi only after the First World War in Gurgaon, after which no such monument has been built till date
 May the martyrs get respect
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj yuvaaon main fouj ke prati rujhaan kam hota ja rahaa he or aaj yuva army main ruchi nahin dikhaate
 Also, in the issue of One Rank One Pension, the Government has also cheated the soldiers, which is quite wrong

 At the same time, suspense was also placed on his own participation in the Lok Sabha elections

 Three phases of Lok Sabha elections have been completed
 Campaigning for fourth phase is going on loudly
 chunaav ke bich vipakshi partiyon ne ek baar phir iviem ko lekar chintaa vyakt kii he or supreme court kii sharan main pahunch gai hai
 The country's 21 opposition parties have filed a petition in the Supreme Court for surprise tally of votes of EVM and VVPAT
 supreme court ne pehle hi chunaav ayog ko vivipat or iviem kii kuch voton ke milan kaa aadesh diya tha
 The court, in its order, had asked for such matching at 5 booths in an assembly, but now opposition parties have filed a review petition on the same decision
 ab yachikakarta partiyon ne court se kaha he ki vah sirf 5 booth hi nahin balki aadhi mashiinon par voton kii jaanch kaa aadesh de
 Let us tell you that only after the two-phase voting, several opposition parties raised the issue of disturbances in evms by holding a joint press conference
 is press conference main congress, aam aadmi party, tidipi, tiemasi samet anya partiyon ke netaa shaamil the
 Just during the third phase of voting, former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also alleged that evms are bad all over the country
 akhilesh ne twit kar likhaa tha ki puure bharat main EVM main kharabi yaa BJP ke liye matdaan ho rahaa he
 The DM says that polling officers are untrained for the operation of evms
 350 se adhik iviem ko badla ja chukaa he
 This is criminal negligence
 kya hamen dm par vishwaas karnaa chahie, yaa kuch or adhik bhayaavah he?unke alaava matdaan ke dauraan bhi kai baar iviem main gadabadi, mashin naa chalane kii khabaren saamne aati rahi hai
 For which the opposition are raising questions
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi 21 vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ne lagbhag 6

 Sidhu Vani roared fiercely on Thursday
 navjot singh siddhu ke jubaani golon se koi nahin batch sakaa
 If Sidhu started taking arrows from his political quiver, then did Kejriwal, what Badal family, BJP and what Captain Amarinder Singh, all came to target
 siddhu ne bhavi raajnneetik rodmap ko saaf karte hue 'punjab, punjabiyat or punjabi' kaa naaraa bhi diya
 For Kejriwal, he said, 'aam Aadmi and Darshan Chhoti' were the main targets of Sidhu, Arvind Kejriwal, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party
 siddhu ke mutabikbite dedh-do saal se 'aap' ke log hi unhen apane saath lene ke liye dore daalane main jute the
 Sidhu said, 'kejriwal Ji tweeted about meeting me, but he told half truth
 main puri baat bataata hum
 He (kejriwal) asked me not to contest Punjab elections
 kaha, aap prachaar kiijie, apni patni ko ladaaiye, jeetne par unhen mantri bana diya jayega
 According to Sidhu, after this, he called you 'sat Sri Akal'
 siddhu ne 'aap' par chutile andaaj main tanj bhi ksaa
 Sidhu said for you- 'they (AAP) are naïve in the heart of the heart, big names and small darshans
 ' unhone aap ke liye ke liye enorki (araajaktaa) shabd kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 Read: Sidhu's Fifty: When speaking, do not leave anyone, know - who is the hero, who left the Zero Rajya Sabha? Sidhu claimed in the press conference that he did not resign from Rajya Sabha membership because of Kejriwal
 siddhu ne rajyasabha chhodane kaa kaaran bhi bataaya
 Sidhu said that he was asked by the BJP to campaign for the Badal family, which he refused
 siddhu ne saaf kiya ki apane vivek se unhone ye faisla kiya tha, iskaa kejariwal se koi lenadena nahin tha
 Please tell that Sidhu had resigned from Rajya Sabha in July
 tabhi se siddhu ke bhavi raajnneetik kadam ko lekar kayaas lagaae jate rahe
 Sidhu said in his heartache that “there has been a tradition in India that good people are used as decoration items and only for publicity
 'badal parivaar par barase siddhupunjab main sattarudh shiromani akali dal ke kartadharta badal parivaar par bhi siddhu ne jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa

 'badal or captain, donon ek hi thali ke chatte-batte'congress netaa captain amrendra singh ke liye siddhu ne kaha ki wo din main kuch or shaam ko kuch baat karte hai
 Attacking the ruling Akali Dal and the opposition Congress party, Sidhu said that both Badal and Captain are on the same plate
 akali or congress par mileebhagat kaa aarope lagaate hue siddhu ne kaha, 'nattha singh and prem singh, van and saim thing
 All these parties play friendly matches

 Sidhu termed his front as a voice of revolution and said that its blueprint would be cleared in 15 days
 siddhu ne kaha ki amritsar unka ghar he or unka makasad sirf punjab kaa vikaas he
 Explain that former Olympian hockey player Pragat Singh is with Sidhu in this front
 pragat singh pehle akali dal se jude the, jahaan se unhen nilambit kar diya gaya

 baithte hi so janaa or phir kharraaton kii aisi gunj jo duusare yatriyon ke liye ban jaati thi pareshaani kaa sabab
 Even though his body used to fall asleep, the mind woke up so much that the spirit of the watchers trembled
 6 ghante kii neend main 453 baar dimag jaag jaataa tha or ek minute 10 second tak ke liye to saansen bhi tham jaati thim
 This is not a story but a reality, of a person who had become a victim of sleep apnea due to obesity, that his life had become hell
 ruh kampa dene vaali ye kahani he dhanbad main rahane vaale kol marchent mukesh kumaar kii
 Mukesh Kumar is around 40 years old
 beete saadhe chaar saal se vah apane motaape auki sleep apnia kii vajah se viklangon kii tarah jindagi ji rahe the
 He has accumulated his business after working hard on his own feet
 mukesh ko saal 2013 ke baad motaape ne is tarah jakadaaa ki uskaa sidhaa asar dhandhe par dikhne laga
 He weighed 131 kg
 mukesh kumaar motaape kii vajah se sleep apnia se grast ho gaye
 He was fed up with life for many hours, like feeling sleepy, feeling lethargic, sitting asleep, waking up from sleep, stopping oxygen in sleep, having headaches, snoring fast and many more
 halaat yahaan tak bighad gaye ki train main baaki musafiron ke saath unke liye sona tak dushwaar ho gaya
 During the journey in the train, the passengers of the entire bogie would get involved
 kharraaton kii aawaaj baaki logon ke liye bardaasht se baahar ho jaati thi
 Due to this problem, it had become a compulsion to leave the train for a thousand kilometers
 dhanbad se dilli tak kai nami-giraami doctoron ko dikhaaya
 During the sleep study, it was found that during 6 hours and 10 minutes of sleep, due to lack of oxygen, the brain wakes up 453 times and 3500 snoring sounds are loud
 neend main 1 minute 10 second tak saans rukne lagi thi
 On the advice of doctors, a seepup machine (oxygen supply machine) was installed at bedtime, but two years of talk did not even work
 puraa ghar unki beemaari se pareshaan ho chukaa tha
 The wife and two children in the house had become accustomed to snoring
 motaape kii vajah se unke pairon auki qamar me dard hone laga tha
 There was a decline of 90 percent in upgrading the business
 branded kapade pahanane ke shaukeen mukesh kumaar ko kapade ke sho room se bhi niraashaa haath lagane lagi thi
 Their size had reached 48, while the size was usually not more than 44
 puure din tikhaa mirch-masala vaala khaanaa khaane kaa man karata tha
 Mukesh was cutting his life as a burden
 magar neend main saans ruk jane kii beemaari ne unhen upar se neeche tak jhakzor ke rakh diya
 This was not an ordinary disease
 aanan-fanan main doctor se paraamarsh liya
 After a thorough examination, the doctor clearly stated that either he should get the fat stored on the windpipe after the operation, or he will lose weight in 6 months, otherwise any part of his body will get damaged
 doctor kii kahi yah baat vaaki daraane vaali thi
 Then Mukesh Kumar himself started finding out about bariatric surgery
 beriatric surgery ke liye unhone tamaam jaanch padtaal ke baad mohak hospital indore ko chunaa
 Mukesh came to Indore with his friend quietly without telling anyone from home
 dow mohit bhandari ne unke har sawaal kaa jawaab diya
 He was awakened and convinced to go straight for surgery
 25 may 2017 ko surgery se ek ghante pehle unhone ghar waalon ko phone kar bataaya
 The night that came three days after the surgery brought happiness for them like Jannat
 saadhe chaar saal baad unhone chaiyn kii neend lee
 Today, in just 4 months, he lost 33 kg from surgery
 ab unka vajan 98 kilo he auki vajan kaa girnaa lagaataar jari he
 Now their business is growing quadruple day and night and it seems as if they have got another birth
 unka kahana he ki beriatric surgery ke liye mohak hospital desh kaa sabase bharosemand aspataal sabit ho chukaa he
 You can see the full story of Mukesh Kumar in the video below
 kya he beriatric surgerybahut zyada mote log jo chal nahi pate, jinhen saans lene main takalif hoti ho, blad pressure kii beemaari ho, diabetes ho, aise logon ke pareekshan ke baad beriatric surgery kii jaati he
 This surgery is of three types
 pehla hota he ki yadi koi vyakti zyada khaanaa kha rahaa hota he to uski diet ko kam karne ke liye yani pet ko chota karne ke liye
 This is called Restrictive Surgery
 duusari surgery he maal akzaptive surgery
 There is food going on in the body, but it is not digested
 teesri tarah kii hoti he metabalik surgery
 This surgery is for diabetic patients
 ye teenon tarah kii surgery behad safal he
 a large number of people have received effective treatment with metabolic surgery and got rid of diabetes forever
 maujuuda vakt main bharat main diabetes ke 95 fisadi marij tip-2 diabetes se grasit hai
 There is no deficiency of insulin in this patient, but the insulin circulating in the body is not working properly, because it becomes resistant to disease
 yah sab hormonal gadabadiyon kii vajah se hota he
 Through this surgery, the balance of hormones make insulin active
 isse diabetes kii beemaari puri tarah se khatm hui he
 How is bariatric surgery? Bariatric surgery is not liposuction surgery
 yani sharir ke kisi bhi surphace se fat nahin nikaala jaataa balki pet ke anwanted saij ko kam kar yaa pachan tantra ko thik kar kiya jaataa he
 Also, many hormonal changes are also made through surgery
 yah surgery behad surakshit he
 The team of seductive Beriatrix & Robotics, who performed this surgery in India, has undergone specialized training from a prestigious institution in France
 mohak aspataal, indore main robot ke jariye bhi is surgery ko puraa kiya jaataa he
 Robotics surgery is much more accurate surgery than manual
 is surgery main aadhe se ek ghanta lagata he or do se teen din ke baad marij kii aspataal se chuttee bhi ho jaati he
 Every day from the second day of surgery, rapid weight loss starts and 30 to 40 kg of weight is lost in 3 to 4 months
 bharat main bhi motopa ab banane laga jaanaleva, duniya main bharat tisare number parabharat main ab tak garibi auki kuposhan ek gambhir samasya thi, lekin ab teji se bad rahaa motopa mahamari kaa rup le saktaa he
 This has been said in a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
 abhi tak duniya ke baaki deshon main hi motaape kii samasya pair pasaar rahi thi, lekin ab bharat main bhi motopa badhata ja rahaa he
 According to an important study, about 13% of the 1
25 billion population of the country are suffering from obesity
 kuposhan ke mukaable motopa aane vaale dinon main ek gambhir chunauti ke rup main saamne aayega
 Junk food, fast food, soft drinks, food irregularities and changing lifestyles have also led to many people becoming increasingly obese in India due to Western civilization
 motaape kii vajah se kai gambhir bimaariyaan logon ke sharir main ghar kar rahi hai
 There are many fatal diseases like blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, joint pain and thyroid
 ausat se zyada motaape kii vajah se yah bimaariyaan khud-ba-khud chali aati hai
 This is why obesity proves fatal
 duniya main 15 fisadi log gambhir motaape se grasit hai
 India is third in the case of obesity
 pehle paaydaan par united state aaf america he jahaan 15 se 18 fisadi log motaape kii chapet main hai
 The share of such people in China is 10 percent, then India is at number three where 5 to 8 percent of the people are struggling with obesity
 tip-2 diabetes se desh ke 5 karod log grasit hai
 According to the WHO (world Health Organization), currently 80 percent of the middle and lower middle class people die from the disease in the country and this figure will double between 2016 and 2030
 isi prakaar 'da lans global health' ke mutabik duniya menheart atake simrane waalon kii sabase zyada taadaat bharat main he
 Its death rate in India is 23 percent, while it is 15 percent in south-east Asia, 7 in China, 9 in South Africa and 9% in West Asia
 donon hi gambhir bimariyon ke peeche sabase badi vajah motopa hi he
 These diseases also disappear as soon as obesity of a fat person suffering from all such serious diseases is removed
 ausat se adhik mote yani jinka body maas index 32
 For those over 5, bariatric surgery is very effective for them

 bharat tisare number par he jahaan 5 se 8 fisadi logon ko motaape ne gher rakhaa he
 This clearly shows how obesity is making its place in India

 Question- How much has changed in terms of weight loss surgery and technique? Answer- Weight loss surgery and technique is changing day by day
 ye surgery pehle bada chira laga kar kii jaati thi, lekin aajkal do yaa teen chote-chote chhed kar kii jaati he
 This surgery is called Single Insulation Laparoscopic Obesity Surgery (SILS) and is also performed through a robot
 sawaal- is surgery ko lekar logon main behad sanshay he
 Are there any side effects? Can people lead a normal life after surgery? Answer- In this surgery the stomach size is reduced and the food is bypassed
 logon ko lagata he ki isamen yaa to bahut zyada vajan kam ho jayega yaa bilkul bhi vajan kam nahi hoga yaa is surgery se kuch kamplications honge, lekin aisa kuch nahin he
 Actually, this surgery is absolutely safe

 80% of the surplus weight is reduced in surgery
 isse zyada yaa kam nahi kiya ja saktaa
 Nutrition is recommended after surgery

 According to a new research, if girls remain foolish in front of boys, then this makes boys happy
 ladakiyon ko yah bhi lagata he ki unhen apni samajhadaari ko kam karke dikhaanaa hota he taaki ladke bhaybheet na mahasoos karen
 Research by Doctor Maria do Mar Períria of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Warwick found that boys as young as 14 had the impression that girls of their age would be less intelligent
 peryria ne kaha, 'samaaj main aise baari dabaav hai, jo ki yah tay karte hai ki ek purna purush or purna mahila ko kaisaa hona chahie
 Young people adapt their behavior to fit these pressures in order to fit into the society
 'unhone kaha, 'in dabaavon main se ek yah he ki yuva ladakon ko yuva ladakiyon se zyada pradhan-chatur, majboot, lanbaa, mazaakia hona chahie or yadi ve khud se zyada budhimaan kisi mahila ke saath sambandh main hai, to isse unka paurush kamjor padegaa
 'for study Periria spent time as a student in eighth grade after permission from the school and allied administration to understand the daily life of school children
 zyada se zyada samaj hasil karne ke liye unhone skool main chaatro kii har dainik gatividhi main bhaag liya
 She attended classes, learned physical education lessons, took exams, dined in cafeterias, played in the playground and went to shopping centers with her after school
 iske baad ve yuva logon kii baatcheet, bhaawanaaon or vyavhaaron ke un pahaluon ko samaj sakin, jin tak shikshak or abhibhavak aksar nahin pahunch pate
 Perria said, 'to be a real man or woman, we take certain things as necessary
 ye jo vichaar hamaare dimag main hai, ve darasal prakritik nahin hai
 They are such restrictive conditions, which are harmful for both girls and children
 ' yah dharna ki purushon ko mahilaon par haaavee hi hona chahie, ladakon ko lagaataar chintaa or dabaav main rakhti he, unpar apni takat sabit karne kaa dabaav rahata he
 Be it fighting, drinking, sexual harassment, refusing help, or hiding your feelings
 'peryria ne kaha, 'ladakiyon ko lagata he ki unhen apni kshamtaayen kam karke bataani chahie, apni asal budhimaani kii tulana main kam budhimaan dikhnaa chahie, shoshan ke khilaaf nahin bolnaa chahie or aise shauk, khelkud or gatividhiyaan chhod deni chahie, jo ‘ladakiyon ke anuroop’ nahin lagate hon
 ' shapath grahan se kuch ghante pehle hi cabinet mantriyon kii list saamne aane lagi he
 The phone has started reaching potential ministers from the Prime Minister's Office, who are to be sworn in this evening
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bich ghanton tak baithak hui
 After which it has now been decided that there will be nine special ministers in the Modi cabinet, who may have a big responsibility
 1
 Rajnath Singh: Rajnath Singh, who was the home minister in the previous government, is set to become a minister once again
 bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh rahe rajnath ko narendra modi kaa bharosemand netaa mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, once again they can get some big responsibility
 khabaron kii maane to rajnath ek baar phir grih mantri hi ban sakate hai
 2
 piyush goyarun jetali kii anupasthiti main piyush goyal vitt mantralay ke sabase bade daavedaar hai

 Smriti Irani proved to be the biggest star of this election Smriti Irani can also become a minister today

 5
 nitin garkaripichhali sarkaar main parivahan-sadak jaisaa mantralay sanbhaalane vaale nitin gadakari kaa ek baar phir mantri bananaa tay he
 Narendra Modi had also given the task of cleaning the Ganges to Nitin Gadkari, in this way Modi 2
 0 main unki jimmedaari bad sakati he

 He has got a call, so he can become a minister today

 "jai jawan jai kisan"
 
 
 yah naaraa bharat ke purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne diya tha
 Through this slogan, he wanted to send a message in the society that farmers and jawans decide the direction and condition of the country, if it does not happen then the country's plight will happen
 jahaan jawan desh kii raksha karata he, vahiin kisaan kheti ke jariye desh ko dana detaa he
 If there will not be a farmer, we will all find ourselves in a corner where there will be money in hand, but not grain
 
 
 aaj ham jab "jai kisaan" kaa naaraa sunate hai, to kuch ajeeb sa lagata he
 Today, there is no defeat of farmers, but defeat
 kisaan bhookha or bhavuk he
 Farmers are committing suicide due to crop failure
 akele uttar pradesh main pichley kuch maheenon main 100 se bhi zyada kisaan khudakushi kar chuke hai
 There are continuous reports of farmer suicides from Maharashtra, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and other parts of the country as well
 vaise to media main kisaanon kii aatmahatyaon kii baaten aati rahati hai, lekin media ko is mudde ko lekar jitna gambhir hona chahie, vah shaayad nahin he
 In the battle of politicians, the real issue of the farmer is hidden
 kisaanon kii bite kam or rajanetaaon kii zyada dikhaai jaati he
 When there is a debate on the issue of farmers on TV channels, politicians appear in the window, not farmers
 rajaneta bhi kisaanon ko lekar bas apane tareeke se 'gambhir' nazar aa rahe hai
 If someone is trying to raise the issue of farmers through a rally, then someone is talking about compensation
 pradhanmantri ji khud bhi kisaan ke liye gambhir najar aa rahe hai
 From 'mann Ki Baat' to the platform of politics, we are talking about the farmer
 pradhanmantri ne kisaanon ke liye muawza bhi badha diya he, jo acchhee baat he
 But the question arises whether this compensation reaches the farmers
 agar pahunchataa he, to kitna pahunchataa he
 Recently, there were reports that in some areas of Uttar Pradesh, checks ranging from 50 to 200 rupees were being given to the farmers as compensation
 jaraa sochiye ye muaavja he yaa kisaanon ke saath majaak
 If the situation remains the same, no matter how much compensation is increased, the condition of the farmers is never going to improve
 main bhi gaanv se aata hum
 i know how much the farmer loves his farming
 subah se lekar shaam tak kheti main laga rahata he
 Whenever natural calamity comes, the farmer gets scared
 raat bhar unako pareshaan hote hue dekha he
 If there is going to be a flood, the farmer keeps on trying to prevent the water from reaching the fields
 agar chakravaat kaa andeshaa ho, to ve raat bhar radio sunate hai ki aandhi kahaan tak pahunchi, kitna nuksaan karegi
 Just think what will happen to the farmers when crops are ruined
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya koi nai baat nahin he
 According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau, from 1995 to 2013, 2 lakh 96 thousand 438 farmers have committed suicide
 yah koi chota aankada nahin he
 The 2014 report has not come, but in 2013, 11,772 farmers committed suicide, while in 2012 13,754 farmers committed their lives
 2014 or 2015 main ye aankade or adhik ho sakate hai
 Of the total number of suicides in India, about 11 percent are farmers
 rajaneta kisaan ko lekar baat to karte hai, lekin kisaanon ke paas koi pahunchataa nahin he
 Farmers are also worried about the Land Acquisition Act
 rajnatik dal is kanoon ko lekar ek-duusare ko gher rahe he
 If the Congress is engaged in making its land through farmers, then the BJP is talking about changing the fortunes of the farmers with the Land Acquisition Act
 lekin jiske liye kanoon bana he, uski haalat main koi sudhaar nahin he
 Only politics is happening
 nitin gadakari, sonia gandhi or anna hazaare ko bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon par khule manch par bahes ke liye chunauti de chuke hai
 Sonia Gandhi is also not ready to back down
 jo chijen wo apni party ke shashan ke dauraan 10 saalon main nahin kar pain, ve ab kar rahi hai or kisaanon ke saath kheton main khadi najar aa rahi hai
 If Nitin Gadkari is so serious about the problem of farmers, then he will have to reach the farmers first and the farmers will have to explain about this law
 nitin gadakari jis rajya se aate hai, us rajya main sabase zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 In 2013, 3,146 farmers gave their lives in Maharashtra
 kya sach main ham sabhi kisaanon kii samasya ko lekar gambhir hai? ho saktaa he, main bhi nahin hum
 My article may not have exposed all the issues of the farmers, but more than that people should take this issue seriously, who want to shine their luck on the farmers, keep doing politics on this issue from morning till evening
 kisaanon kaa mudda us din hal ho saktaa he, jab sabhi rajnatik dal sach main is mudde par raajnneeti karne kii bajaay ekajute hokar kisaanon ke haq kii ladaai ladenge
 Actor John Abraham is becoming unbelievable like dal-badlu these days
 vajahah unka kisi film ke liye haa kehane ke baad na kahana
 And he did this with Nikhil Advani's Chand Bhai and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Chenab Gandhi films

 The Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana editorial has commented on Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's statement on Vidarbha issue on Wednesday
 saamana main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri banane ke baad nagpur main unka bhavy swaagat hua lekin isko unhone apane vivaadaaspad bayaan se kharaab karke rakh diya
 Vidarbha could have avoided the issue CM Fadnavis Chief Minister said that the Vidarbha will be separated at the appropriate time
 kya mukhyamantri ko ye shobhaa detaa he ki wo is tarah ke bayaan den
 He could have avoided this issue but he did not do it, if he had said that there would be no shortage for the development of Vidarbha, it would probably have been good but he did not do so and put salt in saffron milk of Maharashtra
 
 saamana ke sampadakeey main likhaa gaya, mughalon ne jab chaaron taraf aatank machaa rakhaa tha or puure raashtra ke kai shaktishaalee logon ne apane hathiyaar daal die the tab maharashtra main bhavani kii talwaar uthi thi isliye raashtra or maharashtra kii tulana ke vakt maharashtra kii apni ek swatantra bhoomika ho sakati he
 Commenting on Fadnavis in Saamna, it has been said that BJP has got a huge public opinion from Vidarbha this time
 unhen sabase zyada siten mili hai, lekin vidarbha ke is janadesh ko galat na samajha jaae, ye na sochaa jaae ki ye janadesh vidarbha ko maharashtra se todane ke liye he
 Separating Vidarbha from Maharashtra means breaking the son from his mother
 maharashtra kaa rakhwala hi ghotaale ko tatparsamna main kaha gaya ki maharashtra ke nae mukhyamantri ko bhi maharashtra ko todane vaali is tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se bachanaa chahie
 These words coming out of his mouth make it seem as if the keeper of Maharashtra is ready to scam
 vidarbha pichhadaa he uskaa pichhadaapan dur karnaa mukhyamantri kaa kartavya he
 In Maharashtra, Bhagoda is in the hands of one Lal of Vidarbha, in such a situation, it is the first duty of the Chief Minister to develop Vidarbha and if he does not do it then it will be the same as the doctor went to the surgery of the patient in the operation theater
 Came out on one side
 saamana main kade shabdo main kaha gaya he ki sudhir mungantiwar ab nae vittamantri hai or fadanvis mukhyamantri
 In such a situation, the people of Maharashtra have handed over the Jamdhan in their hands so that meaningful work is done, but don't take the wrong decision from the beginning
 vidhanmandal ke nagpur adhiveshan par fadanvis kaa samarthansamna ke sampadakeey main fadanvis ko kuch had tak sahuuliyat dete hue aage kaha gaya he ki ham devendra kii is baat se sahamat hai jisamen unhone kaha ki vidhanmandal kaa nagpur adhiveshan puure chah hafte chalanaa chahie jisamen sabhi lambit muddon par charchaa kar us par aakhri nishkarsh nikle
 For the past several years, the Winter Session of the Legislature was being taken care of
 aise main nagpur maharashtra kii up rajdhani he or vahaan hone vaala adhiveshan karmkand kii tarah puraa nahin kiya janaa chahie or is adhiveshan main maharashtra ke saath-saath vidarbha kii bhi samasya or unke samaadhaan ko lekar nishkarsh nikaala janaa chahie, jis par satta paksh or vipaksh donon sahamat hon
 In the last column of the report, Fadnavis has been warned that there will also be Vidarbha in the queue of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh, so that no one thinks
 mukhyamantri kaa kahana he ki congress ne andhra ke vibhaajan main jo chook kii wo chook vidarbha ke vibhaajan main nahin hogi, lekin maharashtra kii nigaah main maharashtra kii tulana akhand andhrapradesh se karnaa or vibhaajan kii baat karnaa kisi bade aparaadh se kam nahin or koi ye na soche ki ise baaki rajyon main jaise sarvasammati se bachaa liya gaya, vaise maharashtra main bhi kar liya jayega
 The stage has been set for the election of bjp's national president
 buudhvaar shaam 6 baje is ore aadhikarik adhisuchana bhi jari kar di gai he
 According to this notification issued by the election in-charge and vice-president of BJP Avinash Rai Khanna, elections for the post of president will be held on January 24
 adhisuchana main likhaa gaya he ki namakan patr bharne kii tithi or samay 24 janvari ko din ke 10 baje se 01 baje tak he
 After this, nomination papers will be scrutinized from 01 am to 01:30 pm and there will be a nomination time
 soochna main yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki agar jarurat padi to pad ke liye chunaav 25 janvari 2016 ko subah 10 baje se dopaher 02 baje tak bhi ho sakate hai
 Significantly, on Tuesday, RSS General Secretary Krishnan Gopal had also met senior BJP leaders Lal Krishna Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi after the election for the post of president
 kya hogi amit shah kii dobaaraa tajposhi?bataa den ki adhyaksh pad ke chunaav ke liye jaruri aadhe se zyada rajyon main sanghathan chunaav sampann ho gaye hai
 It is almost certain that Amit Shah will be handed over the command of BJP again
 haalanki, uttar pradesh, bihar, maharashtra jaise kai bade rajyon main abhi sanghathan chunaav nahin hua he or pradesh sanghathan kaa chunaav sampann hue bagaiyr vah rajya rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav main hissaa nahin le saktaa he
 In the electoral states like Kerala, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam where the Speaker has been nominated, those states will also remain out of the election of the National President
 bijepi ke samvidhan ke anusaar aadhe se zyada rajyon main chunaav ke baad rashtriya adhyaksh ke chunaav kii prakriya hoti he
 With the organization elections in Odisha on Thursday, this process has been completed in 19 states unanimously
 bataaya jaataa he ki uttar pradesh ikai kii ore se bhi kendriya netritv ko yah sandesh diya ja chukaa he ki vah pradesh adhyaksh ke chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 If the leadership wishes, elections can be held there in two to three days
 
 
 
 So Shah will have his first term
bjp According to the constitution, the president can be contested twice for three years

 Currently, the country's largest upi-based payment services company, Paytm, has raised this question
 petm ke siio vijay shekhar sharma kaa maananaa he ki kendra sarkaar videshi companiyon ko badhaane ke liye desh main kuch bhi kar sakati he
 Vijay Shekhar said that earlier whatsapp's parent company Facebook had tried to dominate the Internet services in the country through Free Basic
 sharma ke mutabik ab ek baar phir whatsap kii koshish desh ke open upiai pement sevaaon main entry karne kii he
 The head of Paytm has raised the question whether the central government should give a payment bank license to whatsapp? It is noteworthy that Aadhaar is not a mandatory requirement for payment bank services through whatsapp
 petm kaa kahana he ki aadhaar se pement seva ko link karaane se graahak adhik surakshit rahata he
 At the same time, Sharma has argued that due to the feature of not needing any kind of log-in using whatsapp, it is not safe to license payment bank to this social media app
 ise padhein: whatsapp pement ko sahuliyaton se baukhalaayaa Paytm, lagaaya pakshpaat kaa aropadesh main whatsap kii pement seva shuru karne ke liye payalat project launch kiya ja chukaa he
 During this launch, a new payment feature will be seen in the chats of millions of whatsapp users
 is feechar ke jariye vah mobile se pement karne kii suvidha le sakate hai
 whatsapp users just need to share their bank details with whatsapp and they can easily send money to any of their contacts
 petm ne sawaal khadaa kiya he ki kyon whatsap ko lakhon yugers ke saath apana payalat product launch karne kii manjuuri di gai he? jabaki aam taur par is kshetra main kisi company ko payalat project ke liye 5 se 10 hajaar yugers kii anumati di jaati he
 New update of whatsapp, know the complete way to send money, questions arise from Vijay Shekhar Sharma's objections
 kya 'mek in india' kii nitiyon par chalate hue kendra sarkaar videshi company ko desi company ke mukaable majboot karne kaa kaam kar rahi he? Pakistan's parliament has passed a bill to set the girl's puberty as 18 years to prevent child marriage in a Muslim-majority country
 kuch saansadon ne ise islam ke khilaaf bataate hue is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 1929 was introduced by Sherry Rehman, MP of the Pakistan People's Party, which would help to curb the practice of child marriage in the country
 express tribune kii report ke anusaar vipaksh ke jabardast virodh ke bich is vidheyak ko somvaar ko paarit kar diya gaya
 The lawmakers termed the age of puberty as against Islam
 saansad gafoor hydari ne iskaa virodh karte hue kaha ki nikaah ke liye 18 saal kii umr tay karnaa sharia ke khilaaf he or is vidheyak ko aage kii charchaa ke liye islamic vichaardhaara parishad (iaisi) ko bheja ja saktaa he
 Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Nurul Qadri said that a similar bill was sent to the IIC in 2010 which was returned by the council saying that it was not in accordance with Fouqah
 yuvavastha kii umr samyaanusaar badalati he or ise tay nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Former Speaker of Parliament, MP Raza Rabbani, supporting the bill, argued in the House that the bill had earlier been sent to the IIC, where it had been pending for many years without discussion
 unhone kaha ki sindh assembly pehle hi is tarah ke vidheyak ko paarit kar chuki he jise ab tak kisi manch par chunauti nahin di gai yaa virodh nahin kiya gaya
 He said that in other Islamic countries also, the puberty age of girls is fixed at 18 years

 bollywood actress shridevi kaa nidhan dubai main 24 farvari ko ho gaya tha
 He was cremated in Mumbai on 28 February
 haftaa bhar bitne ke baavjood parivaar or phans abhi bhi actress ko yaad kar rahe hai
 Sridevi's elder daughter Jahnavi has shared a sentimental post on Instagram for the first time after the demise of her mother
 unhone likhaa, hamane maa khoi par papa kii jaan chali gai
 Jahnavi - Khushi with Sridevi - may not have seen these RARE PHOTOS Actually, on 7th March it is Jahnavi's birthday
 berthde par aksar unki bachapan kii kute tasviren post kar shridevi unhen janmdin kii badhai detii thim
 This time, Jahnavi shared a post on Instagram before his birthday, wrote, 'on the occasion of my own birthday, the only thing i want to say to you is that you love your parents
 unhen pyaar karte rahen or khud ko us pyaar ko mahasoos karne ke liye samarpit karte hai
 They made you and i want to say that you miss my mother, pray for her soul for peace
 unke liye apana pyaar or prashansa jari rakhie
 Jahnavi also asked people to respect the relationship of parents
 unhone likhaa, 'kripaya yah jaan len ki meri maa sabase zyada pyaar kisi par nyochhavar karti thim to wo papa the
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing that filled the world with happiness
 jitne samarpit wo ek-duusare ke liye the shaayad hi koi doosraa kabhi ho saktaa he
 Please respect this
 'shmashaan tak 'mom' shridevi ke sirahaane aise khadi raheen khushi-jahnavijahnvi ne likhaa, 'maine or khushi ne hamaari maa kho di, lekin papa ne apni jaan kho di he
 She was much more than just an actress, mother or wife
 vah apane har kirdaar main best or bemisaal thim
 Giving love and getting love was important in his life
 logon ke liye acha or dayaalu hona or kabhi bhi niraashaa, frustation yaa jalan kya hoti he wo nahin samajhati thim
 So give love to her as she was
 ye baat shaayad unhen unki maut ke baad bhi khush rakh sake or unhen ye lage ki unhone kabhi aapako kuch diya tha
 Only fill well and give love only to make him happy, to know that even in death, he gave you everything
 pichley kuch dinon main hamen pyaar or sahaayta ke liye dhanyavad
 It is giving us hope and strength and the less we can thank you the less
 'on my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote themselves to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you’ll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who’s entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his "jaan"
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn’t understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let's be that
 Let’s be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That's what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It’s given us hope and strength and we can’t thank you all enough

 madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan sonia gandhi ko chitthee likh digvijay singh kii shikaayat karenge
 They will also ask for time to meet Sonia Gandhi so that they can directly complain
 shivaraj kaa kahana he ki digvijay singh or kapil sibbal jaise netaaon ne unke kilaaf farzi maamle banaae
 Shivraj Singh claims that the SIT created by the High Court found the allegations leveled by 'team Digvijay' to be false and has submitted its report to the High Court
 sansad bhawan pahunche shivaraj singh chouhan ne enditivi india ke puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki ve sonia gandhi se poochna chaahate hai ki kya un par farzi aarope sonia gandhi kii sahmati se lagaae gaye yaa phir bina unako bharosa main liye
 If all this was done without the knowledge of Sonia Gandhi, will the party take action against leaders like Digvijay Singh and Kapil Sibal
 shivaraj ke mutabiq vyapam ghotaale ke naam par unpar farzi aarope teen vajahon se lagaae gaye
 The first is that many criminals belong to Digvijay Singh
 doosraa ki congress pradesh main har chunaav main munh kii kha rahi he
 In such a situation, leaders like Digvijay Singh feel that they cannot win an election without tarnishing the image of Shivraj
 or teesraa ki iske zarie madhya pradesh ke vikaas ko baadhit karne kii saazish rachi gai
 With all these questions, he wants to meet Sonia Gandhi
 lekin kya sonia samay dengeen? shivaraj kaa kahana he ki unhen is baat kaa bharosa he ki jab ve samay maangenge to sonia gandhi unako samay dengi
 Regarding the writing of the letter, some newspapers published the news, they called it baseless and said that the letter is yet to be written
 tippaniyan It is worth mentioning that Vyapam scam was leveled by some heavyweights of Congress with the help of some papers that all these papers point towards Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 itnaa hi nahin congressi netaaon ne kuch mantriyon ke alaava mukhyamantri kii patni par bhi is ghotaale main shaamil hone ke aarope lagaae the
 Explain that in Madhya Pradesh, a government organization named Vyapam conducts all the competitive examinations of the state government
 shivaraj singh kaa daawa he ki hoicourt kii taraf se banaai gai esaiti ne 'team digvijay' kii taraf se lagaae gaye aaropon ko jhootha paaya or usne apni report hoicourt ko de di he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who arrived in Parliament House, said in response to a question asked by NDTV India that he wanted to ask Sonia Gandhi whether fake charges were leveled against her with the consent of Sonia Gandhi or without her trust

 He said that this is completely wrong

 He said, 'I told you in English as well as in Hindi
 ye koi choti-moti baat nahin he or maine us din bhi udhaaharan diya tha ki ye koi coffee pine kii baat nahin he
 If anyone takes a decision with a lot of thought, then with great seriousness, because the Constitution is being talked about and we deliberately gave Dr
 manmohan singh ko shaamil nahin kiya, kyonki wo purv pradhanmantri rahe hai or jahaan tak kuch or logon kaa sawaal he, ham nahin chaahate the ki un logon ko jhanjhat main daalen
 If Congress sources are to be believed, apart from Manmohan Singh, p
 chidambaram, virappa moili, salmaan khurshid jaise varisht netaaon ke sin nahin hai
 Apart from this, Manish Tiwari and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge are also not openly agreeing for impeachment
 yah poochne par ki mahabhiyog kii jo prakriya aapane bajet seshan main shuru kii, isamen kya suspence tha or kya isko lekar aapaki party ke bich main sahmati nahin thi
 
 
 In response, Ghulam Nabi Azad said that there is no question of consent and disagreement
 sahmati shuru se hi thi, lekin jaisaa kapil sibbelji ne kaha ki gambhir vishay tha, aisa nahin he koi maamuli aadmi ho, to isamen soch-vichaar jaruri tha
 On another question that PIL has been put up for impeachment in the Supreme Court today, Sibal said that it would have been better to have asked for your opinion
 kyonki aap samvidhan kii raksha karte ho or agar aapke munh band kiye jaaen to wo samvidhan kaa ulanghan hoga
 Asked what are the ways left to you if Sabhapati rejected it, Sibal replied that if such a situation comes, we will also tell you the way, there are other ways in the Constitution
 kuch aisi baat nahin hui he, naa hamane zikr kiya, naa unhone kiya
 Team India avenged their loss to England in the last two series and recorded a 4–0 historic win
 isse pehle usne mohammad ajaharuddin kii captaini main england ko 3-0 se haraaya tha
 Meaning it is also the biggest win over England in terms of series
 yah jeet captain viraat kohli (virat Kohli) ke liye bhi kai myanon main khaas rahi or unhone kai record apane naam kiye
 Team India also got new stars in this series in the form of off-spinner Jayant Yadav and Karun Nair
 jayant ne jahaan oleround pradarshan se sabakaa dil jeeta, vahiin karun nair (karun Nair) ne pehali do pariyon kii asafalataa ko peeche chhodte hue teesri pari main aitihaasik ballebaaji kar di
 In fact, at this time in India, only two things are discussed
 pehali notebandi or duusari team india kii england par dhamaakedaar jeet kii, lekin kya aap soch sakate hai ki yah donon chijen aapas main kisi bhi tarah se sambandhit ho sakati hai
 
 
 Yes, two more things have been added to this and that is Brexit and 'lagaan'
 
 
 vaise dekha jaae to cricket kii jeet, notebandi (demonitisation) or bracit sidhe taur par nahin jude hue hai
 Yes, it is a different matter that home matches were affected due to demonetisation
 kai tiimon ne bisisiai se madad kii maang bhi kii, lekin board ne justise lodha panel kaa hawala dete hue madad se inkaar kar diya
 Then somehow the state associations made direct arrangements for their teams
 vaise bhi cricketer hi kyon desh main bahut se log notebandi se prabhavit hai, lekin ham yahaan baat team india or england ke bich mangalvaar ko samaapt hui siries kii kar rahe hai
 Fans started congratulating him as soon as Team India won 4–0 over England
 badhai dene waalon main cricketron ke saath-saath bollywood celebrities, rajaneta or aam cricket phans shaamil rahe
 Some of our creative twitterites spoke differently

 com / ocp9ed5ht8eng's 5 Day Routine: Wakeup Win Toss Make 400 In 1st Inning Lose Repeat Cc:@piersmorgan # indveng # indvseng # sirjadeja Sir Ravindra Jadeja An absurd statement by Labor Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia in the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh went viral on social media recently
 iske baad mantri sisodiya ne kisi tarah kii pratikriya vyakt karne kii bajaay apane shabdon ko galat maanate hue kaha ki vah use waapas lete hai
 Let me tell you that Mahendra Singh Sisodia, MLA from Bamori of Guna district, came to meet party workers in his assembly village Hinotia on December 31
 unhone kaaryakartaaon ko aashwaasan diya ki unke kaam puure honge
 The minister further said that one of his workers is a cabinet minister
 vah kisi bhi adhikari karmchaaree ko phone karke kaam kara saktaa he
 "whoever does not follow the instructions of the officer-employee regime will be kicked and separated
 " is dauraan mantri ke samarthan main kaaryakartaone naare bhi lagaae
 In the video, Minister Sisodia was seen saying, "any officer-employee who does not follow the instructions of the government will be kicked and separated
" "sisodiya ne shuukravaar ko mantralay pahunchakar apana kaarybhaar grahan kiya
 When this statement was then questioned, he said that he would not tolerate corrupt and careless officials, his choice of one word was wrong which he calls 'withdrawal'
 aamtaur par netaa kisi bhi video par hi sawaal uthaa dete hai, lekinsisodiyane safagoi se apni galati ko sweekaara or uske liye galati bhi maani
 With this, his intention is clear
 He will expect the work of public interest from the departmental officers, who will not do so, action will be taken on them
 sisodiya ne kaha he ki unhen mahatvapurn vibhaag kii jimmedaari di gai he
 He will first work according to the Congress' promise and will try to get as many people as possible to benefit from the government's schemes
 srinagar central jail main band pakistani aatanki naved jatt ke faraar hone par achraj nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki is jail main suraksha intjaamon main jis tarah kii dheel he usase aisa hona hi tha
 The truth is that this jail is like a paradise for terrorists and everything is available here to the terrorists, from internet smartphones to Kashmiri 'vajwan' mutton
 times of india kii ek khabar main yah daawa kiya gaya he
 According to the news of Times of India, the terrorists living in the Central Jail of Kashmir live in full capacity
 jail unke liye jananath jaisaa he, jahaan internet data pack ke saath smartphone se lekar unke khan-paan or shauk kii har cheez mil jaati he
 Many dangerous terrorists are imprisoned in this prison
 jail ke sutron ke anusaar is jail main rulebuk kaa har niyam-kaayda todaa ja rahaa he or rajya prashasan yaa ucchadhikariyon kaa koi hastkshep nahin dikhataa
 Significantly, a major terrorist attack took place on Tuesday afternoon at the Srimahraja Harisingh (SMHS) Hospital in Srinagar
 pulisavaale 6 aatankiyon ko aspataal main chekup karwaane ke liye laae the
 During the firing, a Lashkar terrorist Abu Hanzula alias Naved Jatt escaped
 jail main band aatanki jari karata he press relibehal yah he ki kashmiri media ko aksar central jail main band aatanki kasim faktu urf aashiq faktu kaa press relies mil jaataa he
 This dangerous terrorist human rights activist H

 jail main band aatanki baba baantta he tavijasutron ke anusaar jail main band aisa hi ek khoonkhaar aatanki apane ko baba bataata he or uske darjanon bhakt jail main usase tavij banavaane aate hai
 Many jailed terrorists use mobile phones indiscriminately and talk to all their colleagues from Kashmir to Pakistan
 sutara to yahaan tak bataate hai ki kashmir main saal saal 2010 kii ashaanti kii puri planning jail main hi baithkar bharat virdohi khatarnaak islamic algaavvaadimsarat alamone kii thi or mobile phone se dishanirdesh diya tha
 He used to help the terrorists, according to pharmacists, who have been in jail for ten years, according to pharmacists Mansoor Ahmed was stationed in the Central Jail for the last ten years and he used to help in maintaining the health of the terrorists
 jis doctor jinat nijaami ne naved jatt or paanch anya kaidiyon ko medical chekup ke liye esamechaes aspataal bhejne ke liye refer kiya tha, vah teen saal se zyada samay se jail kii duty par hai
 After the incident, the state government has removed Nokami and Mansoor Ahmed from duty
 haalanki jail suparintendent ahamed rathar in aaropon ko puri tarah se khaarij karte hai
 They say, 'we strictly follow the prison menu
 jail parisar ke bheetar kisi ke mobile phone istemaal karne kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 'significantly, about ten years ago, when the CRPF raided the jail, it received mutton cutting, kebab knives, weapons etc
 and dozens of mobile phones
 lekin uske baad bhi is jail kii vyavastha main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 Accidents of laborers' lives cleaning sewer have become common
 aankade bataate hai ki har paanch din main ek majdoor kii jaan siver saaf karne ke dauraan chali jaati he
 Many times it has happened that a laborer first comes in the grip of poisonous gas, then others also lose their lives in the process of saving it
 lekin ab aisa nahin hoga, siver kii safai ke liye ek robot taiyaar kiya gaya he
 With its arrival, the workers will no longer need to enter the sewer
 dilli se sate gurugram main is tarah kaa ek robot aa bhi gaya he
 Risk of sewer cleaning is carried out Most sewer cleaning workers adopt various methods to clean sewer
 ve qamar se ek rassi baandhakar, haath main baaltee or fawde ke saath siver saaf karne ke liye utarataa he
 Which is not at all safe from the point of view of security
 yahi nahin un mazdooron ke liye khatre kaam he
 Working in the sewer constantly causes skin infections, respiratory disorders
 maut kaa jokhim uthaakar ye apni roji roti kii vyavastha karte hai
 What the figures say in the 2011 census found that 7 of manual scavenging in India
 94 lakh maamle saamne aae hai
 At the same time, one death occurs every 5 days while cleaning sewer since 2017
 safai karmchaariyon ke sanghathan ke anusaar 2016 or 2018 ke bich dilli main hi 429 mautein huin
 a few days ago, 7 people died while cleaning sewer in Vadodara
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne shuukravaar ko bajet pesh karte samay kaha tha ki jaan bachaane ke liye sabase behatar tarika he robot ko safai ke liye istemaal karnaa
 Gurugram Municipal Corporation has asked for such a robot
 yah robot maanav-niyantrit, ardh-swachaalit robot he
 Will clean the sewers of the city
 jaankaree mili he ki is nai pariyojna ke tahat aise hi or bhi robot taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 The robot has been developed by Generobotics based in Thiruvananthapuram
 iskaa uddeshy minial scavenging kii galat pratha ko khatm karnaa he
 Along with this, the safety of the sewer cleaning staff is to be ensured
 emsiji adhikariyon ne kerala main jenerobotics utpaadan suvidha kaa daura kiya
 He adapted and tested the dimensions of Gurugram's manhole
 is robot kii khaasiyat he ki siver main shaareerik rup se pravesh kiye bina ise batano ke sahare chalaaya ja saktaa he
 How are robots, what is special in this robot is connected to a portable generator and compressor
 isaki lambaai lagbhag 1
 5 meters
 robot kaa vajan lagbhag 80 kilogram he or gaharaai tak jaakar safai kar saktaa he
 a human operator navigates the robot inside the sewer, staying near the manhole and through the colored buttons on the control room
 robot ke haath manhole ke andar jaakar thos ikattha karte hai
 While the robot's 'feet' help stabilize the machine
 isamen siver ke andar gaison ke str ko maapne ke liye sensor, raat ke samay upyog ke liye lits or waterpruf infrared watch ke saath saath andar ke drishyon ko dekhne ke liye camera bhi maujuud he
 It takes three to four hours to manually clean a sewer
 vahiin yah robot 20 minute main hi apana kaam khatm kar saktaa he
 This robot has the ability to clean 10 manholes a day
 vartmaan main isaki keemat 32 lakh rupe he
 But the team is working on reducing this cost further
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki ab kisi ko siver ke andar jane kii jarurat nahin he, isliye gaison ke sampark main aane kaa khatra bhi nahin he

 Oscar-winning veteran musician A
 aar
 Rahman, who has proved his mastery in the field of music as a musician, is now going to prove his skills in the field of direction through 'L Musk', the world's first virtual reality film
 rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke noida main 'l musk' kii ek jhalak pesh karne aae rahamaan ne nirdesan ke maidan main utarane ke bare main unhone kaha, "virtual reality film ko lekar abhi koi bhi kuch nahin kar rahaa he

 He faced 103 balls and hit 7 fours in his innings
 nathan ne shuruyaat dhimi kii thi, lekin lay main aate hi bade shot khele
 Nathan, who missed his first century by 8 runs, faced just 60 balls and hit 8 fours and 4 sixes

 After these two, Stark showed his brilliance and removed the wickets to the team at crucial times

 gail ampire ke is faisle par naaraaz the, isliye unhone rivyuu le liya jo asafal rahaa or gail ke saath windies ko bhi niraashaa hui
 Nicholas Pooran (40) and Shai Hope (68) stepped on the wicket and started putting pressure on Australia by sharing 68 runs for the third wicket
 is baar leg spinner adam jampa ne australia ko raahat di
 He got Puran caught by Captain Finch for a total score of 99
 phir hope ko shimron hetmer (21) kaa saath mila
 The pair could not go much further and with a total score of 149, Shimron Hetmyer was run out in a hurry to take a run
 hope ek chor par saath dhund rahe the
 Captain Jason Holder (51) supported him, but this time Hope kept breaking the partnership
 unhen kamins ne 190 ke kul score par khwaja ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 Hope played 105 balls in his innings and hit 7 fours
 ipel main apane tufaan se kai match palatney vaale andre rasel ke saamne yahaan bhi lagbhag waisi sthiti thi, jisase ipel ne unhen avgat karaayaa tha, lekin rasel ipel kii safalataa nahin doharaa paae or stark ke saamne natmastak ho gaye
 Captain Holder and Carlos Brathwaite then put Australia in trouble
 yah donon scoreboard aage badha rahe the or australia kii jeet kii sambhaavnaaon ko kam karte ja rahe the
 Australian captain Finch once again entrusted the responsibility to Stark
 stark is baar bhi safal hue
 He first sent Carlos Brathwaite to the pavilion on a personal score of 16 and then followed Holder
 shelton kotrel (1) ko stark ne bold kar apana 5waan shikaar banaaya
 The Windies lost their ninth wicket as Shelton Cottrell

 Oshane Thomas could not open the account even after playing four balls and returned unbeaten without scoring

 Carlos Brathwaite (67 / 3) took the most wickets from the West Indies
 newjiland ke khilaaf semifinal mukaable main mahendra singh dhoni jis tarah ran out hue, uskaa riple phir se dekhie
 See where Guptil caught the ball and threw it
 darasal yah guptil kii kismat rahi ki unka thro sidhe stump main laga or dhoni ran out ho gaye
 Guptil himself believed this also the next day
 dhoni kii jagah koi or khilaadi hota to bhi vah is thro par ran out ho gaya hota
 Dhoni was actually converting one run into two runs
 yah kaam ve pehle bhi karte rahe hai
 The great players who are accusing him of being slow, may not have been as fast in their entire career as Dhoni was on that day
 yah is baat kii daleel nahin he ki mahendra singh dhoni ko abhi ritair nahin hona chahie
 Dhoni has been in international cricket for 15 years
 uske pehle kai saal unako sthaneey cricket main kaatane pade
 Rather, his journey was much longer than the players of Mumbai, Delhi and chennai-bengaluru, because he was from a city where the lightning would end by reaching the cities of mecca-medina of Indian cricket
 jaahir he, khel ne unase dusron ke muqaabale kahin zyaada qeemat vasuuli hogi
 One day, he too has to retire and it should be a day when the aura of his game is at its peak
 aap khel tab choden jab log aapse haath jodakar maidan se baahar nikalne kaa anurodh karne lagen to isamen koi badppan nahin he, balki ek tarah kii avmaananaa hi he
 Therefore, this comment is not being written to explain that Mahendra Singh Dhoni should not retire now - he has to decide and he will wait soon - but it is being written to tell that we have cricket going on here Analysis of how T-20 and IPL are enamored with the raging culture
 is vishleshan ke rashtriya dabaav kaa khamiaja pehle bhi kai khilaadiyon ko bhugatna padaa he
 Ambati Rayudu was dismissed on the basis of the performance of just a few innings in such a way that he left the cricket world
 ek daur main rahul dravid or is daur main cheteshwar pujaara ko vanade maichon ke liye naqaabil maan liya gaya
 While anyone who has seen Cheteshwar Pujara play, he can very easily tell that he is a solid batsman as well as an excellent stroke player
 ve vanade team main bhi chauthe number ke aise thos ballebaaj ho sakate hai jo kisi sankat main pari ko sambhaal sakate hai or kisi apatkaal main team ko behtareen ran rate de sakate hai
 But people have accepted the ODI or T20 as simply a game of fanfare
 ve jaise yah maan kar chalate hai ki jo bhi khilaadi har over main do-chaar chauke-chakke lagane kaa damakham na rakhata ho, vah sachcha antarrashtriya khilaadi he
 Hardik Pandya or Rishabh Pant will undoubtedly be a very good batsman, but most people are unhappy because of their hunger
 is lappebaazi ke abhyaas ne world cap semifinal main hamen jo nuqasaan pahunchaaya, uske doshi darasal ve khilaadi nahin, ve vishleshak hai jinhone inase bilkul chamatkaar kii ummid laga rakhi thi
 Dhoni's performance in the World Cup 2019 is also being tightened to such a test
 jo log is baat par jhunjhala rahe hai ki unhone england ke khilaaf aakhri overon main jeetne kii koshish nahin kii, ve yah nahin samaj paa rahe ki us din angrezon kii gendbaazi ke aage vah lakshya lagbhag naammumkin ho chalaa tha
 In the new culture of Harakiri, who lost the wicket by batting, if Dhoni is not cast, if he has calculated that it will not be possible to win this match and also see that this defeat is not going to have very bad results and he has innings
 There is nothing wrong in keeping it better to keep it running
 newzealand ke khilaaf bahut mushkil halaat se team ko baahar nikaal kar laane kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 The run rate was also under his control
 bas cricket jis anischitata kaa khel mana jaataa he, uske ve shikaar ho gaye, nahin to bahut sambhav tha ki ve bharat ko final tak le jate
 Actually, the decision to field Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya before Dhoni in this match was the result of the same vision in which we are considering cricket as a game of only fours and sixes

 Now it is conceivable that if Dhoni had come in at number four and had been dismissed after gradually bringing the team to a point, then we would have had batsmen like Rishabh and Pandya to handle the remaining work
 vah kahani ab badali nahin ja sakati
 But we can take care of the characters of the coming stories
 sawaal dhoni kaa nahin, bhartiya team ke chunaav kaa he
 In trying to make the team of the future, we should not lose the team of the present
 australia ne kareeb 20 saal tak cricket kii duniya par raaj kiya to isliye bhi ki ve sirf taatkaalik pratibha ke bal par khilaadiyon ko chunate or baahar nahin karte rahe
 a tough player like Mike Hussey had to wait until he was over thirty to play a test
 bharat jaise hadabadaaya hua he ki vah ek team tod kar duusari team bana le
 It is difficult to say, for this, there is more pressure on the bench adorned with talented players or such cricket experts, who see cricket as a spectacle and think that the slow player is an old player
 newzealand ke williamsan tej khilne vaale ballebaaz nahin hai, lekin unhone world cap main jo karishma kiya, uski vajah se newjiland lagbhag world cap jeet gaya
 Guptil was retained by the New Zealand team despite consistent poor performances and he did wonders with a run out in the semi-finals
 bharat ke vidwaan chayankarta hote to williamsan or guptil donon ko team se baahar kar chuke hote
 In fact, not only Dhoni will suffer the brunt of such a selection vision, but also those young players who will have some extra burden on their shoulders
 kyonki phir isi aadhaar par unhen baahar karne kii muhim chal padegi
 Whatever the team chooses at the moment, do not say that Dhoni has slowed down

 After the bumper victory of BJP in the MCD election, the question "kaun Banega Meyer" is now being raised
 ye sawaal isliye bhi dilachasp he kyonki is baar bijepi ne sabhi parshadon ke tikat katkar nae chehron ko chunaav ladaaya tha
 According to the MCD law, in the first year all three mcds will have a female mayor, so expectations are flying in the minds of women councilors about the mayor's chair
 manoj tiwari ke ghar nae parshadon kaa tantadilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari aajkal ghar par nae parshadon se ghire hai
 The motive is to congratulate and show gratitude to their leader after the victory, but on this pretext, the councilors are not left behind to shine their face, keeping an eye on the mayor's chair
 koi apni jeet kaa margin bataakar apni takat bataata he, to koi party ke liye kiye gaye kaamon kaa anubhav ginaata he
 The attempt is that now after becoming a corporator, any post in MCD should also be included
 mahrauli se jitkar aayi aarti singh ke pati gajendra singh dilli pradesh bijepi kii team main mantri hai, manoj tiwari se milin to bataanaa nahin bhuuli ki parshad banane se pehle wo patrkaar bhi rah chuki hai
 At the same time, he also expressed that he will do work in the area, will not depend on husband for the work of councilor
 in netaaon ke ghar bhi jam rahi he bheedsirf manoj tiwari hi nahin party ke duusare netaaon ke dar par bhi koun banegaa meyar kantest main daanv lagane ke liye parshadon kii qatari lag rahi he
 In the house built in the rear part of the Delhi BJP headquarters of Pant Marg, the party's organization General Secretary Siddharthan lives, the procession of new councilors comes here throughout the day
 mauka milte hi mahila parshad meyar pad par apni daavedaari jataana nahin bhuulatin
 Bhavna Malik, who was elected as a councilor from East Delhi's Mayur Vihar 2, introduced the organization minister from her administrative experience as a principal and also showed that if she gets further responsibility from the councilor, she can do it well
 
 purvi dilli se hi preet vihaar kii parshad chuni gayi babita khanna art aaf living main yoga teacher hai or ummid kar rahi hai ki agar party unki kaabiliyat ko to tarjeeh detii hai, to meyar ke liye daavedaari main peeche nahin rahengin
 In the South MCD, Shikha Rai and Kanwaljit Sehrawat are at the forefront of the MCD Act, the post of mayor is reserved for women councilor for the first year, hence the discussion has started with the names of the mayor among women councilors
 south emsidi main shikha raay or kanwaljeet saharaavat ke naam sabase aage hai, lekin nandini sharma or pehle parshad rah chukin sarita jindal kaa naam bhi majbootee se linna ja rahaa he
 In North Delhi, Priti Aggarwal and Poonam Parashar, president of Mahila Morchi, are in discussion, while Kanchan Maheshwari and former councilor Neema Bhagat are in the discussion in East Delhi
 haalanki manoj tiwari pehle hi saaf kar chuke hai ki meyar kaa chunaav modi ke sapanom kii kasuti par hoga, lekin ye dilachasp hoga ki bijepi kise tarjeeh degi sanghathan ke anubhav ko yaa phir parshad rah chuki mahilaon ke tajurbe ko
 Users are quite surprised to see a video of a woman surrounded by viral three whale fishes on the internet
 darasal, 'adorable animals' naam kefesbukpej par ye video share kiya gaya he
 In the video, it can be seen that a woman who was alone in the middle of New Zealand suddenly caught three whale fishes
 machhliyon ko dekhte hi mahilan ghabara jaati he or vah khud ko bachaane kii koshish karti dikhaai detii he
 Looking at the video, it appears that the woman first fishes kodolphin, but after a closer look, the woman finds out that all three fish are whales
 mahila ne kaale rang kaa swim suut pahana he, jise dekhakar ye mana ja rahaa he ki kaale rang ko dekhakar whale machhliyaan mahila kii ore aakarshith huin
 But it is a matter of relief that the three whalefish did not cause any harm to the woman
 isse aisa lag rahaa he ki machhliyaan sirf kaala rang dekhakar mahila ke saath khilne ke mood main thim

 " adwani ne musalamaanon se aagrah kiya ki raashtra hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue loksabhaa chunaavon main matdaan karen or kisi party ke khilaaf dushprachaar se prabhavit na hon
 Advani said that as part of his conspiracy to discredit his 1991 rath yatra, opposition parties called him anti-muslim
 adwani ne website main kaha ki mere kisi bhaashan main muslim virdohi yaa galat shabd kaa prayog nahin hua
 Rather, i stopped those who shouted wrong slogans

 Perhaps that is why Rahul has now confessed that he had no choice but to join hands with Laloo Yadav, who was out on bail after serving a jail sentence in the fodder scam case
 mumbai main guuruuvaar ko mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main rahul ne kaha ki bihar main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye lalu kii argedy se gathbandhan ko bhrashtachar ke prati unke rukh main badlaav ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he lekin unke paas koi vikalp bhi nahin bachaa tha kyonki aisa nahin hota to congress ko kuch siton kaa nuksaan ho jaataa
 It is worth noting here that he is the same Rahul Gandhi who talked about tearing and throwing away the central government ordinance involving tainted mps as rubbish
 rahul gandhi ne supreme court ke us aadesh ko sunishchit karaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai jisase tahat doshi qaraar die gaye saansadon ko chunaav ladane se rokane kaa praavdhaan he
 This is the reason that even after being released from Ranchi jail, Lalu will not be able to contest elections for the next six years
 rahul gandhi ne adarsh socity ghotaale ke mudde par maharashtra kii prithviraj chavaan sarkaar ko bhi fatkaar lagaai thi
 But, when Rahul shared the stage with former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan, the BJP strongly targeted the Congress Vice President
 is ghatana ke baad congress bhi rahul ke bachaav main khadi ho gai he
 In response to a question about the possibility of tickets being given to Chavan and Kalmadi, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha said that the charge sheet and FIR do not mean guilty

 Is Reliance Jio's 4G Speed balloon Really Exploding? Recently the world's famous speed test website Speedtest
 in kii parent company Ookla ne ek graph jari kiya tha jisamen jeeyo kii 4G speed main giravat dikh rahi thi

 ab TRAI isapar muhar lagaati dikh rahi he
 Myspeed Speed test website of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)
 trai

 in bhi is batki tasdik kar rah he ki duusare operators ke mukaable reliance jeeyo kii 4G speed desh bhar main sabase kam he
 It is worth noting that this portal of TRAI collects speed test data from across the country through its myspeed app
 yahaan graph ke jariye darj kiye gaye4g kawarej ke aankadon ke mutabik airtel11
 The average of 4mbps is at the first position with 4G speed
 hamaare 4G speed test main bhi jeeyo ke mukaable airtel ne baaji maari thi jiskaa video aap neeche dekh sakate hai
 However, this speed decreases with increasing location
 TRAI kii speed test website par 4G everej speed main duusare paaydaan par 7
 Reliance is with a speed of 9mbps while Idea and Vodafone have numbers on the third and fourth respectively
 paanchave or aakhri paaydaan par jeeyo he jisaki everej 4G speed 6
 2mbps
 reliance jeeyo ne TRAI ke aankadon ko khaarij kiya he, ye he company kaa bayaanis report ke baad reliance jeeyo ne daleel pesh kii he
 According to the company's official statement, the data collected by TRAI does not show the correct figures
 aisa isliye kyonki Jio 4G data ke saath har din 4GB kii limit he or test main yah baat nahin kahi gai he
 The company defended it saying, "jio customers use 4G LTE speed before Fair Use Policy (FUP)
 haalaakin FUP limit ke baad speed kam karke 256kbps kar di jaati he
 After 24 hours, the users start getting 4G LTE speed again
 'jeeyo kaa kahana he ki log fere yuses policy khatmahone ke baad jab speed kam milanishuru hoti he tab speed test yuj karte hai or is aadhaar par TRAI par aankaden record hue hai, jo asal nahin he
 According to the company, other operators do not have a plan like the Fair Usage Policy, that is, the Internet completely shuts down after their data runs out
 isliye wo speed test bhi nahin karte
