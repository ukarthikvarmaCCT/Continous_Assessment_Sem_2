 In such a situation, if there is a snow storm, there is no way to escape
 aise hi tufaan ne 18 november ko siachin main tainaat hamaare chaar javaanon kii jaan le lee
 But the truth that we are going to show you today, is not of Siachen but of the highest, coldest and most dangerous mountain in the world, that is Everest
 us everest kii jahaan aaj bhi laashen bhatke hue ko rasta bataati hai
 It is the only place in the world where corridors are made of corpses
 kya he deth zone kaa rahasy?aakhir ye jagah koun si he, jahaan laashon ko mile kaa pathar bana diya jaataa he
 And they don't even have two yards of land
 kyon ye laashen insaanon ke liye mil stone bana di jaati hai
 Why it does not worsen even after hundreds of years
 in tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab duniya kii is sabase oonchi barfili chotii par hai
 An icy mountain where humans die
 magar unki laashen vahaan se waapas kabhi nahin aati hai
 Because this mountain does not allow those corpses to come back from there
 laashen ban jaati hai 'milastone'zamin aisi banjar or darre itane oonche ki yahaan tak pahunchnaa zindagi kaa maqasad to ho saktaa he
 But not helplessness
 kyonki yahaan maut zindagi par baari pad jaati he
 This is Everest, the world's highest, coldest and most dangerous mountain
 har saal ise fatah karne kaa mishan banaakar yahaan kareeb teen-saade teen sau log aate hai
 Some are successful and some fail in this snow here
 magar ye mar kar bhi marate nahin hai
 They teach others from their mistakes that the path on which they died
 us par janaa manaa he
 And sometimes their corpses also serve as Google maps for the climbers who come here
 laashen bataati hai rasteverest ke parvat par is vakt 308 se zyada mil stone yani laashen gadi hui hai
 Seeing the climbers who come here decide their destination
 ye log koun hai inkaa khulaasa karenge
 But before that it is important to know how these people who have become milestones on Everest died after all
 ek aankade ke mutabik sabase zyaada maut yahaan pair phisal kar girane kii vajah se huin
 And after that, people lost their breath when the brain became numb due to the cold
 98 saalon se 'milastone' bani laashensarkaron ne ab tak in laashon ko unke apano tak pahunchane kii koshish bhi nahin kii
 Because bringing down the corpses to the ground from this snowy peak is not impossible
 balki andaaze se zyaada kharchila bhi he
 So the Intezamia Committee of Everest leaves these dead bodies here
 ek anumaan ke mutabik agar everest par padi 308 laashon main se kisi ek laash ko bhi utaara jaae
 Not only will it cost 30 lakh rupees, but the people who climb these snowy peaks will be in danger of losing their lives
 barfili pahari se utarate vakt hui mautminas 16 se mines 40 degree kaa ye wo taapmaana he, jahaan ham or aap jane kaa tasawwur bhi nahin kar sakate
 There these climbers insist on climbing these steep hills
 jo takreeban khudakushi karne ke baraabar he
 Some go to an extent and return
 to kuch aage jane kii zid main apni jaan jokhim main daal dete hai
 And these 308 corpses belong to the same people
 jinhone kudarat ke kahar se ladane kii zid kii
 Among those who died, there are many who conquered the summit of Everest
 magar unki maut is barfili pahari se utarate vakt hui
 The corpse known as Green Boot is climbed on this hill of Everest from two sides
 or in donon taraf alag alag duuri par parvatarohiyon kii laashen saalon se padi hai
 These zombies have no names
 bas inke kapadon or juute rasta bataane vaale pahchaan chinh ban gaye hai
 This corpse is known as Green Boot
 jo everest ke uttar-purvi raste par he
 Which is of Indian mountaineer Shevang Paljor
 jo saal 1996 main everest par chadhaai karte hue barfile tufaan main funs kar maare gaye the
 Till date, Shewang's body is lying there and is known as Green Boot
 shevang kii tarah kai or laashen bhi inhen raaston par hai

 Life and karma are two integral aspects of human life that cannot be separated from each other, but the problem comes when the person only considers his actions to be right and the other person's work is always wrong
 baharhaal, har baar yah dharna sahi sabit nahin hoti, lekin khud ke sahi hone kaa vaham achche khaase rishte main daraar daal detaa he
 The husband and wife are tied to the door of faith
 sambandhon kii majbootee ek duusare ke sahyog par nirbhar karata he
 If either of them starts to believe only themselves and the other's words are wrong, then this relationship will become difficult
 rajdhani dilli ke ek sandhya kalege main darshan shaastra ke praadhyaapak pro amol chatarji kehete hai, ‘hamamen se adhiktar log apane kiye hue kaamon ko hi sahi maanate hai
 He feels that his thinking is right and everything he did was right
 duusare vyakti ke kaam main unhen hameshaa dosha najar aata he
 This mindset is not correct
 ’pro chatarji kehete hai, ‘aisa nahin he ki har baar doosraa vyakti hi galat hota he
 Every person has to take decisions according to his circumstances
 aise main sahi galat kaa anumaan swayan lagane kaa matlab hota he ki ham kahin na kahin apane andar ahankaar ko majboot kar rahe hai
 If there is no ego, then we will clearly understand the mistake made in our work or our wrong decision
 ’ On hearing the name of AIIMS, a confidence arises, there will be proper treatment here
 dilli ames main aisi suvidhaayen bhi hai jahaan deshbhar marij aate hai or unka behatar ilaaj bhi hota he
 On the lines of Delhi AIIMS, it was decided to open AIIMS in many parts of the country and gradually AIIMS has also been ready in many states
 lekin jab dilli ames kii tarah ummid liye marij yahaan pahunchate hai to unhen niraashaa haath lagati he
 'aaj Tak' did reality checks of Patna, Raipur and Bhopal AIIMS
 hamaari padtaal main pataa chalaa ki bhale hi in aspataalon ke naam main AIIMS judaa he
 But there is a huge shortage of doctors to modern equipment and patients are helpless to move from here to other hospitals
 5 saal baad bhi patna ames badahaladilli ke sabase bade swasthya santhaan ames main bihar se rojaanaa saikadon kii sankhya main log apana ilaaj karaane jate hai or isi samasya ko kam karne ke liye purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main kai shaharon main dilli kii tarj par ames kholane kii kavayad shuru kii gai
 Patna was also lucky and AIIMS got a gift from that too
 7 saal kii deree ke baad aakhirkaar 2012 se patna main ames main kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Netaji's promise a few days ago, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey also said about Patna AIIMS that he wants the health services of Patna AIIMS to be made so best that people of Bihar do not have to go to Delhi for their treatment
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki 5 saal ke baad bhi kya patna ames main swasthya sevaayen itani behatar ho chuke hai ki bihar ke logon kodilli amsenhin janaa pade? jamini hakeekat agar dekhenge to patna ames kii haalat aaj bhi aisi nahin hui he ki marij is santhaan main har rog kaa ilaaj karvaa paae
 The institute built on the lines of Delhi AIIMS is still functioning without basic facilities
 patna ames main immergency sarvice ab bhi nahihospataal kii agar baat karen to yahaan sabase jaruri cheez hoti he immergency sevaayen, yani ki apatkaal sevaayen magar patna ames main 5 saal guzar jane ke baavjood bhi yahaan par apatkaal sevaayen ab tak shuru nahin hui he
 There is a separate emergency department here, but it is not working
 aise main gambhir sthiti main kisi marij ko yahaan laayaa jaataa he to use yahaan se patna medical college yaa phir indira gandhi institute of medical science refer kar diya jaataa he
 When emergency services are not available in 'patna Bank', without the 'blood bank', then the lack of trauma center can also be seen
 patna ames main aaj bhi blad bank kii seva uplabdh nahin he
 a separate block has been constructed for the blood bank but it is not yet operational
 patna ames kaa nirmaan yah sochakar kiya gaya tha ki bihar or jharkhand ke log yahaan par aakar apana ilaaj karvaa paaenge or isi vajah se is bade santhaan main 28 oparation theatre kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya tha
 But the condition is that only four operation theaters are functioning to this day
 sutron kii maane to patna ames main specialist doctoron kii bhi baari kami he
 Out of 304 doctors, 50 doctors have been appointed by the Central Government for posts of 304 doctors and teachers in Patna AIIMS, but even after 5 years, the situation is that only 50 doctors and teachers are employed here
 yojana ke mutabik patna ames ko 1000 bed vaala aspataal banaaya janaa tha or is santhaan kii kshamta bhi itani hi he magar aaj kaa din yahaan keval 200 bed uplabdh hai
 Even today there is no mortuary in Patna AIIMS, due to which unnatural death of someone here can not be done
 'ajtak' main patna ames ke andar jaakar halaat kaa jayja liya to paaya ki 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi yahaan par ab tak nirmaan kaa kaary chal hi rahaa he
 There are many trucks coming in every day which are loaded with sand, cement, brick and rebar
 aspataal ke paanch jagahon par abhi bhi nirmaan kaa kaary chal rahaa he or har taraf aapako baaluu, gitti or saria kaa dher najar aayega
 This is of the Raipur AIIMS, a doctor of the Department of Medicine, who has been working for almost a year at the Hailraipur AIIMS, recently resigned from his post
 haalanki abhi ve notice period par hai
 Therefore, on the condition of not disclosing his identity, he told 'aaj Tak' that his fellow doctors are leaving the job only because the government has established AIIMS
 lekin uskaa haal-chaal jaanane ke liye phir kabhi palat kar nahin dekha
 According to this doctor, the matter is related to the will power of the government
 jab sarkaar doctoron or staff kii niyukti karne main ruchi nahin dikhaaegi to aakhir kyon doctor aise santhaan main kaam karenge
 According to him, the matter is not just about salary
 job santushti bhi koi cheez hoti he
 Only date for the operation is found here
 Another doctor resigned from his post after 14 months tenure
 unke mutabik AIIMS management or sarkaar ke ravaiye se naa to marij santusht hai or naa hi ve
 He said that due to the extremely limited resources, patients have to give a date for the operation
 kai baar to aisi naubat aa jaati he ki kai marijon ko bairang hi lautaanaa padataa he
 At present, out of 800 doctors, only 100 doctors are posted in AIIMS Raipur
 inamen se 27 doctor notice period par hai
 They are awaiting offer letters from good institutions
 kai doctoron ne to duusare sansthaanon main bhartee hone ke liye apana intervyuu bhi de diya he, unhen is baat kaa intjaar he ki bagaiyr vyavdhaan ke AIIMS prabandhan unka istipha sweekaar kar le
 AIIMS Raipur itself is ailing AIIMS Raipur is still in the works of a dozen big buildings, due to which neither ICU nor wards have been made in different departments
 yahaan tak kii kai mahatvapurn vibhaagon main doctoron kii niyukti nahin ho pai he
 AIIMS has an arrangement to recruit one thousand patients
 lekin aadha-adhuraa nirmaan kaary doctoron kii kami or medical equipment or mashiinon kii kami ke chalate mushkil se chaar sau bed par hi marijon kii maujuudagi darj hoti he
 Where do the people go? With the opening of AIIMS in Raipur, the people of the state hoped that now they would not only get good treatment but also protect them from the open robbery of private hospitals in the name of treatment
 lekin aisa sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Despite the recruitment of doctors in AIIMS, neither patients are being treated properly, nor are the doctors able to stay there
 naukari jwoin karne ke chand dinon main hi yahaan uplabdh doctor istipha dekar raipur ke hi nijee aspataalon main naukari karne lage hai darasal sansadhano kii kami or marijon ke dabaav ke chalate AIIMS raipur main aisa mauhole hi taiyaar nahin ho paaya ki doctor yahaan tainaat hokar marijon kaa ilaaj kar paae
 Similar is the case with the Medical College of AIIMS
 gahan chikitsa vaale saikadon marij AIIMS kii in badi buildingon kaa darshan kar bairang laut jate hai
 The AIIMS management has its own rationale where the list of doctors is recorded as soon as it is admitted to the trauma center of the hospital
 zyaadaatar vibhaagon main ek maatr doctor hi tainaat he
 The names of the remaining doctors are missing from the list because they could not be appointed
 ise lekar AIIMS prabandhan kaa apana tark he
 Medical Superintendent of Raipur AIIMS Dr
 ajay dani kaa kahana he ki yahaan vibhinn shrenee ke doctoron ke 800 pad sweekrut kiye gaye hai
 Apart from this, the setup of about 3800 employees including employees, technicians, computer operators, babu, ward boy, store keeper, telephone attendants and assistants in various departments is approved for the operation of AIIMS administration
 lekin vartmaan main vibhinn vibhaagon main maatr 100 doctoron kii niyukti ho pai he
 About four and a half hundred employees of various categories have been employed through contract basis and outsourcing, so that medical work can run smoothly on the four hundred beds of patients currently suffering from common diseases
 yahaan se doctoron ke jane kaa silsilaa jariems main ICU bhi saamaanya aspataalon kii tarah he, jabaki kai unnat mashiinon ko yahaan lagaae jane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 No special arrangements could be made for heart related diseases
 hriday ke jatil oparation nahin ho pate, kyonki visheshgy doctors nahin he
 Joining was given by AIIMS Raipur, Neurologist, Pediatrician, Orthopedic Surgeon, CTVS Surgeon, Anesthesiologist
 lekin zyaadaatar doctor chand dinon baad hi ames kaa saath chhodkar duusare privet aspataalon main chale gaye
 The same is true of doctors posted in plastic surgery and burn units
 donon unit main doctoron ne jwoining di or aspataal kaa maahaul dekhakar chalate bane
 He too submitted his resignation to AIIMS
 privet aspataal jane ko majaboor marijasaiinsh kaa haal yah ho gaya he ki plastic surgery or bern unit main doctoron kaa tota hone se tamaam bern cese sidhe privet aspataalon ko refer ho rahe hai
 The same situation is with other departments and faculty, including from heart disease to cancer department
 visheshgy doctoron kii niyukti nahin hone se marij ram bharose hai
 After the opening of AIIMS in Raipur, not only Chhattisgarh but also the border states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra also come here for treatment
 aise main is santhaan main doctoron kii maujuudagi or yahaan kaa maahaul behad myne rakhata he
 At present, it is not decided when construction will end in AIIMS Raipur even after so many years and when doctors will be fully deployed
 bhopal ames kii sthiti or kharabbhopal ames kaa halaat bhi kuch patna or raipur jaisaa hi he
 The foundation of the Bhopal AIIMS was laid by the Atal Bihari Vachpayee government in 2003
 or 2012 se ye aspataal marijon ke har ilaaj ke liye chaalu he
 But the post of director has been lying vacant since 15 June 2015
 iske alaava sabhi vibhaagon main karmchaariyon or doctoron kii baari kami he
 According to the hospital administration, only 415 out of 960 beds are available for patients
 marij kii jubaani bhopal ames kii kahaneebhopal ames kii kahani ek marij ne bataai
 How he was brought to Bhopal AIIMS for operation and then to save his life, his family had to be picked up from here and taken to a private hospital
 49 saal kii rahisun nisha bataati hai ki unhen agast 2017 main bhopal ames main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, is ummid ke saath yahaan bhi dilli ames jaisi suvidhaayen hongi
 Rahisun Nisha was taken to the operation theater twice in an unconscious state
 lekin oparation nahin ho paaya
 After which Rahisun's husband Ashraf shifted him from here to a private hospital, where he was treated properly
 ames kii laaparvaahee ke khilaaf ashraf main prashasnic vibhaag se shikaayat kii, jisaki jaanch karai gai or aspataal ne mana ki pehali baar rahisun kaa oparation theatre main infections kii vajah se nahin ho paaya, or phir duusari baar immergency kii vajah se oparation nahin ho paaya
 Actually the Emergency and Trauma Center in Bhopal is still not functioning
 building khadi he keval AIIMS ke nambhopal ames kii sthiti kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yahaan se immergency marijon ko privet aspataalon main bheja jaataa he
 Two departments related to critical emergency are not in service and 10 departments do not have any faculty
 bhopal ames kii nai medical surparitendent manisha shrivastaav kaa kahana he june maheene se baaki 23 or oparation theatre marijon ke liye uplabdh ho jaaenge
 a total of 27 operation theaters have been approved for this but only 4 are available for patients
 medical chaatr bhi badahaali se naaraajamarij hi nahin yahaan se MBBS kii padhai karne vaale medical chaatr bhi badahaali se naaraaz hai
 He says that he came here in the name of AIIMS
 pichley teen saalon main unke saath yahaan keval dhokhaa hua he
 There is a huge lack of faculty here which has affected their studies
 yahi nahin, pichley 3 saalon se ye medical college bina diarector kaa hi chal rahaa he

 bijepi upi main apane tejatarraar yuva chehre ko darkinar nahin kar sakati
 Before next year's assembly elections in UP, there is a lot of discussion about who will be the face of the party in BJP
 party alaakaman loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad se pradesh main lagaataar ek chehre ko nazarandaaj kar rahi he
 Let's know why it is not easy to remove that frowny face
 1
 It is difficult for the Bharatiya Janata Party to sideline its young MP, Varun Gandhi
 khaskar purvi uttar pradesh or uske aas paas ke ilaakon main
 2
 varun gandhi ke bhav kaa ehsaas is baat se sahaj lagaaya ja saktaa he ki elahabaad main jab bijepi kii kaaryakarini baithak chal rahi he, tab bhi vah shahar varun gandhi ke posters se pata hua he
 Not only this, even before this, the city of Sangam is full of their posters
 3
 This Gandhi, who has been a consistent MP from Pilibhit and Sultanpur, may have been allowed to remain confined to Sultanpur, but his increasing popularity in eastern Uttar Pradesh is tarnishing the high command's decision
 padhein: varun gandhi ke samarthan se BJP khafa, kaaryakartaaon ko jari kiya notice4
 According to a survey, Varun Gandhi has a wide support base as a young member of the Nehru Gandhi family and being a local
 matlab varun gandhi number van par hai
 Although Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani is second in the survey, local officials say they are outsiders
 5
 The Assam election results have also proved that elections cannot be won in the name of PM Narendra Modi
 aapako sthaneey cheharaa maidan main utaarna hoga
 6
 abhi haal main bijepi netaa shatrughna sinha ne upi vidhansabha chunaavon main varun ko bijepi kaa cheharaa banaae jane kii vakaalat kii thi
 He said that there is no suitable candidate for BJP in UP at this time more than Varun
 wo party ke liye mehnat se kaam karte hai or unki vahaan sweekaaryata bhi he
 7
 shot gan ne yah bhi kaha ki bijepi ko bihar jaisi galati nahin kerani chahie
 If this happens then the BJP may have to suffer losses in UP as well

 kaarykram is bare main tha ki pichley 18 maheenon main kis tarah manaregaa kanoon me amul chul parivartan karke ise kargar banaaya gaya
 After all, how can the government celebrate the completion of 10 years of the law which Modi himself has called a living memorial of the failure of the UPA

 US President Donald Trump has decided to break away from this bypassing the international nuclear deal with Iran
 trump ke is faisle kii jahaan iran samet duusare sahyogi raashtra aalochana kar rahe hai, vahiin unke is nirnay kaa duniya par bada asar hone ke asaar jataae ja rahe hai
 The move could have many effects on other Asian countries, including India
 1
 Iran ranks third among OPEC countries producing and exporting oil prices
 khaskar asian deshon ko iran bade paimaane par tel supplai karata he
 The maximum oil in India comes from Iran after Iraq and Saudi Arabia
 bharat is aayaat ko or badhaane vaala he
 Recently, when Iran's President Hassan Rouhani arrived in Delhi, India promised him to increase oil imports
 jiske baad ye samajha ja rahaa he ki 2018-19 se iran or bharat ke bich tel kaa kaarobaar dabl ho jayega
 Speaking of 2017-18, India imports 2,05,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran, which is likely to increase to 3,96,000 barrels per day in 2018-19
 maujuuda vakt main tel kii keemat 70 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai he, jo ki pichley chaar saalon main sabase zyada he
 In such a situation, there is a possibility of increase in oil prices due to this decision of America on Iran

 chabahaar bandargahiran, bharat or afghanistan ke bich chabahaar bandargah shuru ho gaya he
 An agreement was reached between the three countries to develop this port
 chabahaar dakshin purv iran ke sistan-baluchistan praant main sthit he, iske jariye bharat kaa makasad padosi pakistan ko bypass kar afghanistan tak pahunchnaa he
 India has already invested $ 85 million for the port and is currently planning to invest about $ 500 million
 bharat is chabahaar bandargah ke jariye pichley saal 11 ton genhun kii pehali khep afghanistan bhej chukaa he
 At that time, America had shown softness on this step of India
 jabaki ab halaat juda hai
 The new US security adviser, John Bolton, is considered to be very tough on Iran
 aise main is baat kii bhi ashanka he ki iran par america kaa sakht kadam bharat ke chaahabahaar nivesh ko mahangaa kar saktaa he

 Which will make the business easier
 is galiyare ko 2002 main manjuuri milane ke baad se hi bharat iskaa hissaa he
 The establishment of this corridor gained momentum when sanctions were lifted from Iran under the agreement in 2015
 lekin ek baar phir is samjhaute se america ke alag hone ke baad is pariyojna ko jhatka lagane kii ashanka he

 Pakistan too has found a place in it and now China is considering Iran
 agar iran bhi essio main saath aa jaataa he to china or rus ke netritv vaala yah sanghathan ek tareeke se america virodh takaton kaa samooh ban jayega or isamen bharat bhi shaamil rahegaa
 In such a situation, while PM Modi along with America and Israel is strengthening relations with Western countries, India may also have to bear the loss of joining anti-american camp from the platform of SCO

 Impact on indo-us bilateral relations India has always been a supporter of rules-based relations at the international level
 lekin america kaa iran se samjhauta todna ek tareeke kii vaadakhilaphi ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, india-us bilateral relations can also have multilateral agreements
 khaskar, yuan climet change samjhauta or trans pacific samjhaute se donald trump ke kadam khinchne ke baad aisi chintaaen or bad gai hai
 In July 2015, there was an agreement under Barack Obama, under which Iran was banned from buying weapons for 5 years
 iske alaava missile pratibandhon kii samaysima 8 saal tay kii gai thi
 In exchange for this agreement, Iran discontinued a large part of its nuclear program and agreed to monitor the remaining parts
 lekin trump ne is samjhaute se khud ko alag kar liya he, jisase antarrashtriya samudaay main raajnneeti garma gai he

 Recently something happened to Shahnaz Gill when another contestant of Bigg Boss, Vikas Pathak i
e
 Hindustani Bhau called him Rakhi aunty

 Angered by this, Bhau commented on Shahnaz
 vikaske is coment par sho ke hostsalmaan khanbhi naaraaz ho gaye the
 When Salman Khan asked Bhau the reason behind this comment, he said that Shahnaz Gill describes herself as Katrina of Punjab, but she behaves exactly like Rakhi Sawant of Punjab
 isliye main unhen raakhi antee kahata hum
 Did Rakhi Sawant's husband say? Rakhi Sawant's husband has also reacted to this comment of Vikas Pathak
 spotboy se baat karte hue raakhi saavant ke pati ritesh ne kaha, ye kya ho rahaa he? koi kah rahaa he punjab kii raakhi saavant or ab kisi ne kaha raakhi antee
 Rakhi is not playing this season
 agar vah kisi kaa naam lenaa chaahate hai to unka len naa jo unke saath khel rahe hai
 Why is Rakhi Sawant involved in this which is external? Rakhi Sawant's husband has asked the contestant of the house to even take a case on taking his wife's name
 ritesh ne kaha, jo bhi raakhi saavant kaa naam sho main lenge main unke khilaaf cese karuunga or iske liye main colors or endimal ko bhi itnaa hi jimmedaar maanata hum
 Shahnaz Gill was also greatly disturbed by this behavior of Hindustani Bhau
 unhone iskaa virodh kiya tha or unke saath mahiraa sharma ne bhi is par naaraazgi jataai thi
 In the beginning, Bhau had said that Rakhi Sawant has nothing to do with this comment
 haalanki baad main salmaan khan ke poochne par unhone bataaya tha ki shahanaz unhen punjab kii katrina caff nahin raakhi saavant lagati hai isliye unhone ye coment kiya tha

 rajasthan ke udaipur aae under world don daaud ibrahim ke vakil shyaam kesavani ne daawa kiya he ki daaud apni puraani sharton par bharat aane ko taiyaar ho saktaa he
 However, he said that he will have to talk to Dawood about this
 daaud ke vakil ne bataaya ki 5 saal pehle daaud arthor road jail main nahin rakhane kii shart par bharat aane ko taiyaar tha
 But the Manmohan government of that time did not show seriousness
 shyaam kesavani ne bataaya ki daaud ke numaayinde landan main ram jethmalani se mili the or mumbai kii arthor road jail main nahin rakhane kii shart par bharat aane kii baat kahi thi
 But even this small condition was not accepted by the then Government of India, whereas in the cases of Abu Salem and Chhota Rajan, the Governments have brought them to India by accepting the terms

 But the government still does not want to bring them, there are other reasons behind it

 At that time Manmohan Singh was in government and he did not accept the condition
 abu salem kii shart thi ki us par faansee kii sajaa kaa aarope nahin lage, tab sarkaar ne mana tha
 Chhota Rajan had also made a condition not to stay in Tihar, then kept it in the CBI bungalow
 sarkaar auron kii shart maan rahi he, lekin daaud bhai kii shart nahin maan rahi he
 According to the lawyer, if David still wants to come or not he will have to ask
 lekin vakil kesavani ko lagata he ki daaud taiyaar he, agar sarkaar se suraksha kaa bharosa mili, to wo jarur aayega

 On the occasion of National Press Day, Manjhi said that when he was a minister, a woman came to him with a caste-specific complaint, but he helped her only because of vote bank

 maanjhi ke in bayanon ko jaanakar ek pal ke liye gussa aata he
 But the second moment, a statement given by him also makes him feel sorry for his condition
 unhone khud hi maan liya he ki wo to 'kuch dinon ke hi siem hai'

 jharkhand mukti morcha ke adhyaksh shibu sorain ne buudhvaar ko chetavanee bhare swar main do took kaha ki bijepi ke saath rajya main chal rahi gathbandhan sarkaar kaa 28 maheene kaa kaarykaal janvari main puraa hone ke baad rajya main jhamumo ke netritv main sarkaar kaa gathan hoga, lekin yadi iske liye bijepi nahin raji hogi to jhamumo samprag (upie) ke saath bhi gathbandhan kar saktaa he
 JMM president Shibu Soren while speaking to reporters in Bokaro, a hundred and fifty kilometers from Ranchi, said in a warning tone that in January next year, after the completion of 28-month tenure of the Arjun Munda-led government of JMM, a new government will be formed under the leadership
 unhone ek baar phir daawa kiya ki 11 sitambar, 2010 ko arjuna munda ke netritv main rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar ke satta main aane ke pehle bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon ke saath jhamumo kaa 28-28 maah ke liye yahaan sarkaar ke gathan kaa samjhauta hua tha or iskaa sammaan sabhi dalon ko karnaa hoga
 Meanwhile, state BJP President Dineshanand Goswami once again clarified that there was no agreement with JMM to run the government in the state for 28-28 months or 56 months
 duusari ore congress ke rajya main vidhayak dal ke netaa rajendra singh ne jhamumo kii maang ko hawa dete hue spasht kiya ki yadi vartmaan sarkaar girti he to rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii naubat nahin aayegi or congress vaikalpik sarkaar banane main madad karegi
 Shibu Soren claimed that while forming an alliance with the BJP in September 2010, there was an agreement to run the government for 28–28 months and according to this, after the completion of the 28-month tenure of the Munda government in January next year, it will now run the JMM government
 Turn
 yah puche jane par ki yadi bijepi satta parivartan ke liye taiyaar nahin hui to jhamumo kya karegi, unhone kaha, ‘ham anya vikalpon kii talash karenge jinamein upie ke saath gathbandhan bananaa bhi shaamil he anyathaa ham chunaavon main bhi ja sakate hai
 Shibu Soren made it clear that his party could compromise with any other party to form the government
 pichley lagbhag do maah se shibu sorain baar baar ek hi baat doharaa rahe hai ki rajya main 28 maah baad satta parivartan hoga hi lekin pehle ke avasaron par unke bete or upmukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne maamle ko sambhaal liya tha or aise kisi samjhaute se inkaar kar maamle ko rafa dfa kar diya tha
 This time in the last three days, Shibu Soren's son and Deputy Chief Minister Hemant Soren has also vindicated his father's claim and right now in Dhanbad on Tuesday he said, 'if Guru ji is saying that half time with BJP If there was an agreement to form a state government, then he is right
 iske khilaaf kisi anya jhamumo netaa ke bolne kaa sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota he
 Hemant said that following this agreement, Munda should leave the Chief Minister's chair for the JMM in January
 is bich shibu sorain ke bayanon se bijepi or jhamumo main badhati daraar kaa laabh uthaane kii taak main baithi congress ke vidhayak dal ke netaa rajendra singh ne kaha ki arjuna munda sarkaar ke girane kii sthiti main rajya main raashtrapati shashan nahin lagane diya jaayegaa
 Singh, while giving fodder to the JMM, said that Congress will not allow President's rule in the state and can support other parties for an alternative government
 isse purv congress kaa spasht mat rahaa he ki vah jhamumo ke saath rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar nahin banaayegi lekin uski sthiti main badlaav se rajya ke raajnneetik maahaul main garmi aa gayi he
 State Chief Minister Arjun Munda, who embarked on a Johar Yatra, refused to say anything in the matter and said that he would say the right thing when the time comes

 The Governor has also given statements from time to time about the state government earlier, but Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav never retaliated against him, and he has been citing good relations

 It will be a matter to see what explanation the Governor will hold on this statement now
 raaj thakare kii party maharashtra navnirmaan sena bhale hi is loksabhaa chunaav main nahin lard rahi ho, lekin raaj thakare puure maharashtra main sabhaayen kar rahe hai
 Neither are they supporting any candidate in the meetings nor are they seeking votes for any party
 iske baavjood unki sabhaaon main umad rahi bheed ne bijepi, congress, shivasena, ensipi samet tamaam dalon kii chintaa badha di he
 However, Raj Thackeray is targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah by calling all his meetings an awareness campaign
 raaj thakare kii is loksabhaa chunaav main ho rahi reliyaan paramparaagat reliyon kii tarah katai nahin he
 This time Raj Thackeray is using power point presentations in his meetings
 is pregentation main wo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke puraane bhaashanon-bayanon ke video dikhaate hai
 Raj Thackeray believes that through these videos, he is exposing the false promises of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP
 dilachasp baat to yah he ki raaj thakare kii in reliyon kaa asar soshal media par bhi saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 Many such memes and videos are becoming viral on social media, in which Raj Thackeray is seen saying in Marathi that 'A Lava Re To Video' means to put that video
 iske baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bhaashan chalane lagate hai
 Raj Thackeray curses the BJP by telling him
 raaj thakare kii in sabhaaon ne bijepi kii chintaa badha di he
 The BJP fears that Raj Thackeray may not cut his votes
 isliye haal hi main bijepi ne raaj thakare ke bhaashanon or power point pregentation ko lekar ellection kamishan se shikaayat kii he
 At the same time, Raj Thackeray has also said openly about his rallies that if his rallies benefit any other party, he is not worried
 kyonki wo naa to congress se mil rahe hai or naa hi ensipi se
 After all, who will benefit from Raj Thackeray's rallies? Political experts say that Raj Thackeray may be denying the political benefits from these rallies, but somewhere behind it there is a big strategy for the upcoming assembly elections
 is bare main maharashtra ke patrkaar praphul bataate hai ki bhale hi raaj thakare apni reliyon ke jariye bijepi par badi chaturaai se nishaanaa saadh rahe hai, lekin wo vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye jameen taiyaar kar rahe hai or loksabhaa chunaav ke jariye ye kaam wo aasaani se kar paa rahe hai
 If Raj Thackeray manages to get good seats in the assembly elections, he will be able to make a place in the next election
 kyonki ab tak ke chunaav main maharashtra nav nirmaan sena ko koi khaasi safalataa nahin mili he
 Is Raj Thackeray strengthening Shiv Sena? Some political experts say that the good and bad effects of Raj Thackeray's rallies can also affect Shiv Sena
 aisa isliye kyonki maharashtra main bijepi- shivasena gathbandhan main he iske baavjood raaj thakare reliyon main keval bijepi or uske alaakaman par hi nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 This shows that Raj Thackeray can benefit Shiv Sena trapped in some trouble somewhere
 vahiin, ek pahalu yah bhi he ki yadi loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena acchhee jeet hasil nahin kar paati he to aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena se kuch netaa raaj thakare kii maharashtra nav nirmaan sena kaa bhi haath tham sakate hai

 He said that due to monitoring of teachers' mid-day meal, teaching work is not interrupted, alternative arrangements will be made in a phased manner

 The central character of the 1959 film, which was of Chinese origin, falls in love with a girl named Basanti, in this story then the political commentary was such that the government did not allow her to be released for 2 years

 26 / 11 means that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack may have been called martyrs by the terrorist organization Lashkar initially, but the same Lashkar believes that the ten terrorists who attacked Mumbai, including Ajmal Kasab, had made many big mistakes, which had its consequences
 Lashkar had to lift
 lihaaza lashkar ne ab nae aatankwaadiyon kii baqayada class lekar uchhahen aisi galati naa dohraane kii naseehat di he
 Lashkar has named this new class his special Kasab class
 pakistan sthit aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ne apane nae sadasyon ko prashikshan ke tahat ‘kasaab class’ bulaai jisamen aatankwaad kii raah pakadaney vaale yuvakon ko samajhaayaa gaya ki ve mumbai hamale ke dauraan jinda pakade gaye aatanki ajmal kasaab kii galatiyon ko na doharaaen
 According to official sources, this was revealed in the interrogation of Lashkar terrorist Mohammad Naveed Jatt alias Abu Hanjala
 hanjala pakistan ke multan shahar kaa nivasee he
 He was arrested by the police in southern Kashmir in the third week of last month
 sutron ne kaha ki apni prishthbhumi ke bare main jaankaree dete hue abu hanjala ne jaanch adhikariyon ko bataaya ki uske pita sena se ritred driver hai or vah or uske bhai jamaat-ud-daawa kii ore se sanchalit madrason main gaye
 jamaat-ud-dawa is a mask organization of Lashkar
 hanjala lashkar kaa pehla aisa aatanki he jisane poochtacha main bataaya ki vah kasaab se mil chukaa he
 Kasab was hanged in the 2008 Mumbai attack case in November last year
 isamen jin galatiyon kaa zikr hota he unamem nauka nasht karne main kasaab evam uski team kii naakaami, satellite phone se asli pahchaan ke saath baatcheet karnaa, bandhak banane main aakshamata or pakade jane kii baaten shaamil he

 But they left the boat empty

 The fourth mistake, which failed to take hostages to the five wrongdoers, was caught by the police
 Lashkar believes that he has been greatly harmed by these mistakes of 26 / 11 criminals
 isse naa sirf bhartiya agenciyaan balki duniya ko uske khilaaf pukhta saboot mil gaye
 By the way, the biggest mistake that Lashkar made in all these mistakes was Akhari being caught alive by Kasab
 isiilie lashkar ne iskaa naam special kasaab class rakhaa he
 Lashkar believes that it is better to die than to be caught alive during such an operation
 taaki saboot haath naa lage
 Kasab and his nine companions were also taught the same
 magar kasaab akelaa tha jo jinda mumbai police ke haath lag gaya
 Later, he was tried and then hanged in Yerwada Jail, Pune on 21 November 2012

 ye isliye bhi ahm he kyonki isane khud wo special class atend kiya tha
 Not only this, he had also met Ajmal Kasab in the seminary of jamaat-ud-dawa
 naved ko isi saal 20 june ko dakshini kashmir se ek muthbhed ke baad giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Naved was infiltrated into Kashmir via Keran in North Kashmir in October 2012 after special Kasab class and necessary training
 uske saath lashkar ke 21 or aatankwaadi the
 Until the end of the entire winter of 2013, all 21 terrorists lived in the forests of Dachigam
 iske baad naved dakshini kashmir pahunch gaya
 According to Naveed, when he met Kasab, his father is a retired driver of the Pak Army
 uske pita ne hi naved or uske bhai ko jamaat-ud-daawa ke madrase main bhej diya tha
 After his arrest, Jute said that he met Kasab for the first time a few months before the 2008 Mumbai attack
 bakaul jute tab wo punjab ke multan jile main lashkar ke borivala shahivala camp kaa hissaa tha
 Kasab's father used to work as a butcher in the same madrasa where Naved lived and studied
 usee madrase main uski mulaakaat kasaab se hui thi
 According to Naved, Kasab was mostly silent during this small meeting
 tab use kasaab ke bare main zyada pataa nahin tha
 But a few months later, he came to know that Kasab had done a big job in Mumbai
 shaukat gani kii hatya kii sajeesh!naved ke mutabik training puri hone ke baad lashkar ke boses ne use khaas taur par dakshini kashmir main oparation ke liye chunaa tha

 Saeed had come close to the border only last week and almost the last week had come to the threshold of the Indian border and knocked Hafiz Saeed, the biggest leader of terror
 rajasthan main jaisalmer ke kareeb or phir gujarat main kuccha or sindh ke ilaake main hafiz said ko dekhe jane kii baat kahi gai he

 balki iske peeche koi naa koi makasad jarur he
 This person is in the headlines once again with a bounty of US $ 10 million on his head
 
 
 vajah ye ki is baar wo hindustan ke behad qareeb pakistan ke aise sarahadi gaanv main dikhaa he, jahaan se hindustan kii duuri 15-16 kilometre se zyaada nahin
 
 
 If sources are to be believed, Hafiz Saeed is not present in these villages
 
 
 balki is baar wo hindustan ke inhen sarahadi gaavon se dahshagardi kii wo napak saazish bun rahaa he, jisaki tapish phir se hindustan ko jhelni pad sakati he
 What does Saeed's activism say? The date is witness that whenever Hafiz Saeed has reached the border of india-pakistan, innocents have died in India
 phir chaahe wo 2008 kaa mumbai hamalaa ho yaa phir 2013 main hindustani fauziyon ke sir kalam karne kii vaardaat
 Intelligence agencies have not one, but tens proof that all this has happened at the behest of Hafiz Saeed
 
 
 or yahi vajah he ki pratibandhit aatankwaadi sanghathan jamaat ud daawa ke is sargana ke sarhad par dikhne ke saath hi hindustani fuj ke saath-saath tamaam khufia agenciyaan bhi alert ho gai he
 If sources are to be believed, this time Hafiz Saeed has appeared in some Pakistani villages like Mithi, Bitala, Islamkot, Mirpur Khas and Kherpur adjoining Tanot area of jaisalmer border in Rajasthan
 bataate hai ki haafiz said ne is baar in gaavon main rahanevaale hindu pariwaron ko khaas taur par yah kah kar aagaah kiya he ki wo hindustan ke khilaaf jamaat ud daawa kii ore se chalaae ja rahe dehshatgardi ke khel main unka saath de
 Saeed has requested these families to send their children to the terrorist camps of Jamaat-ud Dawa and has clearly said that if they want to stay in Pakistan, then they will have to support this nefarious game against India
 said or uske aatankwaadi sanghathan jamaat ud daawa par america ne hi haal main pratibandh kaa elaan kiya tha or kaha tha ki said kaa sanghathan sirf america yaa chand mulkon kaa hi nahin, balki puri duniya ke khilaaf he

 We are working with Pakistan for supplies both in Afghanistan and there

 kolkata main bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hue bavaal ke bich mashhoor shiksha shastri ishwarchandra vidyasagar kii pratimaa tuutane kaa mudda bhi garma gaya he
 While the Trinamool Congress is accusing the BJP workers of breaking the statue, Amit Shah has now released a picture of himself claiming that Vidyasagar's statue has been broken by the Trinamool Congress goons
 14 may kii shaam kolkata kii sadakon par mache is bavaal ke baad aaj dilli main amit shah ne press conference kar puraa ghatnakram bataaya
 Amit Shah said, 'so far 6 phases of the elections have been over but there has been no violence anywhere in the country except in Bengal
 mamata banerjee kaa aarope he ki hinsa bijepi ne kii he
 i want to tell Mamata Banerjee that you are contesting only 42 seats and BJP is contesting in every state but violence did not happen in any state
 jabaki sabhi 6 charnon main bengal main hinsa hui, isse saaf hota he ki hinsa kaa kaaran tiemasi hi he
 If the BJP had been committing violence, it would have happened in other states as well
 trinmul par hinsa failaane kaa aarope lagaate hue amit shah ne ishwarchandra vidyasagar kii pratimaa todane ke liye bhi tiemasi kaaryakartaaon ko jimmedaar bataaya
 Showing a picture, Shah said, 'it appears in this picture that the college gate is closed and BJP workers were outside
 get band he, tutaa nahin he
 Where the statue was kept, it is inside two rooms
 shaam saadhe saat baje kii yah ghatana he
 The college was closed, then who went inside and opened the doors and broke the idol
 kamare kaa taala bhi nahin tutaa he
 Then who gave the key to the room ye saare saboot bataate hai ki pratimaa ko tiemasi ke gundon ne todaa he'
 Amit Shah said that Mamta Banerjee has conspired to break the statue of Ishwarchand Vidyasagar to gain sympathy
 bataa den ki ishwarchandra vidyasagar mashhoor shiksha shastri va samaaj sudhaarak the or bengal main unako bahut sammaan praapt he
 This is the reason that after the statue was broken, Mamta Banerjee immediately went to the university to take stock of the situation and the entire TMC linked the incident to the pride of Bengal and opened a front against the BJP

 Vasundhara Raje was in Mumbai on 5 May, where in a meeting with industrialists from Maharashtra, she asked them to move to Rajasthan as an alternative investment destination
 21 april ko ve pashchim bengal ke pramukh marwari vyavsaayiyon ko sambodhit kar rahi thim
 He asked this community, which is considered the backbone of Bengal's industry, to think about setting up their enterprises in their native state of Rajasthan
 april main hi isse pehle ve japan yatra par gai thim, jahaan unhone yahi nyauta japani niveshkon ko diya tha
 The same request will be heard again in June, when Raje will visit South Korea
 ummid he ki vahaan ve nimrana ke najadik ek vishesh korian audyogic centre kii sthapana kaa elaan bhi karengi, thik us japani audyogic centre kii tarah jo isi jagah 1,167 acre main bharat kaa pehla kaamyaab menuphaccharing centre ban gaya he
 It does not end here
 is saal ke khatm hone se pehle desh or videsh main aisi or bhi kai yatraaon ke kaarykram tay hai, jinhen rajya sarkaar ne “road sho” naam diya he (dekhen graphic)
 State government officials say that there is a motive behind this chaos in the visits of Raje and his important team: to make Rajasthan the story of the next success in India's economic growth
 ve kehete hai ki ek hawa bah rahi he, lekin yah sukhi banjar hawa nahin he, jise aam taur par marusthali rajya main uthne vaale retile tufaanon se jodakar dekha jaataa he
 This is a wind of change
 zyada din nahin hue jab rajasthan ko bimaaru rajya mana jaataa tha
 The term was undoubtedly coined from the first letters of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, but its bottom line was that these four are states with ill economy
 lekin kya rajasthan vaaki udaan bharne ke liye taiyaar he? kya vah narendra modi ke “wibrant gujarat” ke nakshekadam par chal saktaa he, jisaki tarj par raaje ke “risergent rajasthan” ko dhaala gaya he? raaje chaturaai se jawaab detii hai ki ve kisi rajya se muqabla nahin kar raheen
 But what is it in Rajasthan, because of which it is a good investment destination? The figures are only encouraging: the share of industries in the state's gross domestic product is 28 in 2010-11
 45 fisadi se badhkar 2014-15 main 30
 5 percent, indicating a sharp increase in manufacturing sector
 isamen rajasthan kaa bhugol, rashtriya rajdhani se najdiki or nirmaanadhin dilli-mumbai audyogic galiyare ke 40 fisadi hisse kaa yahaan se guzarana khaasi madad kar rahaa he
 Chief Secretary of the state c
 es
 Rajan states that Rajasthan has “342 industrial areas spread over 19,200 acres, making well-developed industrial land readily available in the state
 ”haal hi main rajya kii shram niti ko “rojgaar ke anukool” banane kii pahal kii gai he or bijness prakriyaaon ko aasaan banane ke liye ekal khidki vyavastha bhi kaayam kii gai he
 Apart from his predecessor, Congress's Ashok Gehlot, Raje's image boosting industries also helps the state
 raaje ne 2003 se 2008 ke apane pehle kaarykaal main bhi yahi sab karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 An industrial zone was then created for the Japanese, mous for investment were signed and the first Resurgent Rajasthan Summit for investors was held on the lines of Vibrant Gujarat
 inamen haalanki nimrana to kaamyaab rahaa, lekin zyaadaatar duusare prastaavon par amal hi nahin hua
 What is surprising then is that the Chief Minister has to answer these doubts and questions as to what will ultimately be the result of his swift roadshow and the resurgent Rajasthan summit which is going to be held from November 19 to 21 this year
 raaje is baar bahut ekaagratha ke saath aage bad rahi hai
 After assuming power in late 2013, he spent most of 2014 in reforming labor and industry laws and touring across Rajasthan
 is saal unhone bijness-khoji kii bhoomika akhriyaar kar lee he or takreeban sabhi kshetron main ve public-privet partnership (pipipi) model par dhyaan de rahi hai
 He has appointed bureaucrat Gajendra Haldia, an expert on public-private projects, as an advisor to the government
 raaje kahati hai, “meri koshish he ki november tak itnaa jamini kaam kar liya jaae taaki uske fouran baad pariyojnaayen shuru hone lagen
 "she also states that she is signing the mous of only those projects, which will be started rapidly
 lekin raaje utana nivesh hasil nahin kar pai hai, chaahe vah nijee ho yaa pipipi ke madhyam se, jitne kii unhone satta sanbhaalane ke vakt ummid kii thi
 Even his ambitious plan to lay 20,000 km of roads under the PPP could not generate much interest
 yahi vajah thi ki unhone apane kaarykaal kaa chauthai hissaa bitne ke saath hi niveshkon se milane kaa bidaa khud apane kandhon par uthaa liya
 By the way, his arrow is also directly on the target
 isi saal farvari main rajya sarkaar ne rajya main saura urja parkon kii sthapana ke liye adani enterprijej, anil ambani ke reliance power or assel samooh ke saath alag-alag samjhauton par dastakhat kiye, jinke tahat agle 10 saal main takreeban 70,000 karod ru
 Will be invested
 pramukh sachiv (udyog) vinu gupta sweekaar karti hai ki rajya duusare rajyon ke mukaable nivesh kaa aakarshak sthal nahin rahaa he, lekin ve yah bhi kahati hai ki ab aakraamak marketing ke jariye pichhali kamiyon kii bharpai kii ja rahi he
 Says Gupta, “we are well connected and with the creation of a freight corridor in 2018, the transportation time to Kandla and Mundra ports will be reduced to a great extent
 ” gupta rajasthan rajya audyogic vikaas or nivesh nigam kii prabandh nideshak hai or is naate nimrana audyogic centre kii prabharee bhi hai
 Gupta explains that Honda has invested Rs 4,000 crore
 kii menuphaccharing ikai pichley saal alvar main shuru kii or jesibi tathaa saint gobain ne bhi rajya main apni menuphacchirang ikaiyaan kholi hai
 Industry Minister Gajendra Singh Khivansar says that if Tamil Nadu is a manufacturing hub for automobiles, auto components and electronic hardware, then Rajasthan is also developing into an automotive hub, with over 1,000 in Bhiwadi, Neemrana and Alwar
 Units manufacturing automotive and auto components are going to open
 tamilnadu ke niveshkon se mulaakaat ke baad khinvsar kehete hai, “tamilnadu kii automotive companiyon or raksha tathaa electronics sahit duusare kshetron kii menuphacchirang companiyon ke liye vyavsaayik samajhadaari isi main he ki ve rajasthan main maukey kii talash karen or rajya se milane vaali suvidhaon kaa laabh uthaaen
 This time things are looking really good
 magar asli khel raaje ke kaarykaal ke uttarardh ke dauraan shuru hoga, jab agle saal se pariyojnaon par amal or nivesh ke asaliyat main aane kii baari aegi

 Kejriwal made that video himself after you refused

 Who knows more than you who Kejriwal consulted with outsiders before campaigning against both demonetisation and surgical strikes

 rashtriya janata dal ne rashtriya kaaryakarini kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki nai cameti main 5 upaadhyaksh, 4 mahasachiv, 9 sachiv or 56 sadsy hai
 In Patna, the party chief Lalu Prasad himself announced the committee
 pehle ke mukaable is baar rashtriya kaaryakarini ko chota rakhaa gaya he
 Who got what in the national committee? Raghuvansh, Taslimuddin, Mangnilal Mandal, Ilyas Hussain and Annapurni Devi have been made national vice-presidents in the National Executive of RJD
 argedy kii rashtriya cameti main esaem qamar alam ko rashtriya pradhan mahasachiv banaaya gaya he
 Jayaprakash Yadav, Kanti Singh, Vidyasagar Nishad

 Premchand Gupta has again been made treasurer of the party

 Earlier, RJD state officials met at Lalu Prasad's residence
 10 circular road sthit awaas par baithak main party supremeo ne dal kii kendriya team or pradesh kii team ke netaaon kii list jari kii
 On this occasion, Lalu lashed out at the BJP, giving many advice to his leaders
 'desh kaa baccha-baccha qurbaani degaa'lalu prasad ne party padaadhikariyon ko nirdesh diya he ki panchayat se lekar gaanv tak yah sandesh dena he ki bijepi or sangh parivaar ne kalaadhan ko lekar jo vaade kiye the, wo jhuthe hai
 People have to tell that these people want to break the country on the basis of religion and apartheid
 lalu ne kaha, 'sangh parivaar or bijepi kaa charitra anti dalit he
 In lieu of the national flag tricolor, the Sangh wants to wave its saffron flag and we want to warn that if the flag is tampered with, the child of the country will sacrifice
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan aaj ho saktaa he
 While the political temperature of Gujarat has been very hot for the last one month
 bijepi gujarat kii satta par pichley paanch baar se kabiz he or chhathi baar ke liye betaab he
 At the same time, the Congress has been facing the exile of power in Gujarat for two decades, to eliminate which Rahul is struggling on the land of the state
 gujarat main kul 182 vidhansabha siten hai
 The BJP won the 2012 assembly elections with a thumping majority
 rajya kii 182 siton main se bijepi ne 115, congress 61 or anya ko 4 siten mili thi
 But in the Rajya Sabha elections held in August, many Congress mlas have joined BJP
 guzaarat ke 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main mili voton par najar daalen to bijepi ko 47 fisadi or congress ko 38 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2007 assembly elections, BJP got 49 percent votes, but in 2012 it got 2 percent less votes and lost 2 seats
 jabaki congress ke vot fisadi main kisi tarah kii koi badhotaree nahin hui
 The Congress lagged behind the BJP with just 9 per cent of the votes
 gujarat ke tattakalinmukhyamantri narendra modi ke netritvamein bijepi kii yah lagaataar teesri jeet thi, jisane rajya main party ke pichley sabhi record tod die the
 But things have changed in the present time
 pandrah saal baad soobe main bijepi siem kaa cheharaa narendra modi nahin honge
 With the arrival of modi-shah in Delhi, the BJP has no such charismatic face left in the state that can take the party and government forward with that status
 haalanki congress ke paas bhi koi aisa cheharaa nahin he jiske sahare gujarat kii jang fatah kar sake
 Gujarat has a lot of challenges for the BJP
 gujarat ke king mekarkahe jane vaale 20 fisadi patidaar samudaay jo bijepi kaa paramparaagat voter mana jaataa he vah bhi kahin na kahin se naaraaz maane ja rahe hai
 Apart from this, resentment among Dalits may be overshadowed by BJP due to Una scandal
 pichley teen saalon main gujarat main vijay rupani tisare siem hai
 After Narendra Modi became the PM in 2014, he handed over the chair of Gujarat CM to Anandi Ben Patel, but she could not stay on this chair for long
 soobe ke bigadate halaat ke liye anandi ben kii jagah vijay rupani ko siem banaaya gaya he
 Changing the CM is considered to be the backfoot step of the BJP
 gujarat main do dashak se zyada samay se congress satta se baahar he
 The state has been ruled by the BJP for nearly 18 years
 itane lambey samay se raaj karne kii vajah se bijepi ke prati logon main naaraazgi badi
 The anti-incumbency environment can prove to be a problem for the BJP
 gujarat kii raajnneetik halaat ko bijepi bakhubi samaj rahi he
 That is why PM Modi is constantly visiting his home state of Gujarat
 pichley 12 maheene main unhone 12 baar rajya kaa daura kiya he
 The party is trying to make the atmosphere in its favor by making Narendra Modi visit the state again and again
 iske alaava amit shah bhi puri tarah sakriy hai
 BJP is making constant efforts to allay the resentment of Patel
 bijepi ne vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress ko bada jhatka bhi diya he
 Many Congress leaders, including Shankar Singh Vaghela, have said goodbye to the party
 shankar singh waghela jahaan alag party banaakar chunaav maidan main utar rahe hai to vahiin congress ke baagi vidhayakon ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi has visited Gujarat twice in the last 1 month to break the exile of power
 itnaa hi nahin gujarat main bijepi ke hathiyaar se maat dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Rahul has adopted the strategy of following the path of soft Hindutva in Gujarat

 a few days before this resignation, Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted that his government is determined to eradicate corruption and for this the style of governance will be changed
 aise upaae talaashe jaaenge, jisase bhrashtachar kam hota jaae
 There is less than a year left in the general elections and unemployment is set to be an issue in these elections
 vipaksh ise lambey samay se uthaa rahaa he or ab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jawaab diya he ki desh main beete chaar saal ke dauraan bharpoor naukariyaan di gai hai lekin aankadon main nai naukariyaan dikhaai nahin de rahi hai
 The question arises that whether the question of unemployment in the country is being tried to weaken the issue by entangling it in the data debate? At least this is what the Prime Minister's statement and the cleanliness coming from bjp-ruled states suggest
 naukari ke aankadon par pradhanmantri ke bayaan se pehle bijepi shasit chhattisgarh ke kaddavar netaa or rajya sarkaar main technical ajukeshan mantri peepi pandeya ne bhi sawaal khadaa kiya tha
 PP Pandey, who is responsible for the data of the Employment Exchange in the state itself, said that the data of the state government cannot be trusted
 gauratlab he ki beete 14 saal se chhattisgarh main raman singh ke netritv main bijepi kii hi sarkaar he

 kya duubate bainkon ko bachaane ke liye navratna companiyon ko daanv par lagaaegi modi sarkaar!peepi pandeya ne apane is bayaan ke peeche daleel di ki rajya main yuva varg rojgaar kii nunatam arhata kii umr par pahunchate hi sarkaar ke rojgaar kendra main apana naam likhaa detaa he
 But a few days after writing the name, he either goes for higher education and does not need employment, or starts his business through alternative employment or self-employment
 aise log apana naam sarkaar ke rojgaar kendra se katwane ke liye nahin jate
 As a minister of this department of the state government, PP Pandey claimed that due to this, the unemployment figures of the state government are much higher than the actual figures, so these figures of the government cannot be trusted
 ab chhattisgarh se aae is bayaan ke baad desh ke pradhanmantri bhi desh main berogari ke aankadon par sawaal uthaate hai
 The Prime Minister says that how is it possible that the unemployment figures in the country are so high after the state governments give lakhs of new jobs every year? Read this
 
 
 sankat main LIC, modi sarkaar ke is kadam se kahin dub na jaae aapke beemaa kii rakampradhanmantri kaa daawa he ki maujuuda samay main desh main naukariyon kii gananaa karne kii vyavastha bemaani he or maujuuda daur main nae bharat kii nai arthvyavastha main paidaa hui nai naukariyon kii gananaa is puraani vyavastha se nahin ho rahi he
 Because of this, instead of rejecting the allegations of the opposition, the Prime Minister is claiming that the opposition's allegation is based on government figures
 lihaaja iske liye vipaksh ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa kyonki khud sarkaar kii vyavastha desh main rojgaar or berogari ke vaastavik aankadon ko sateek dhang se ekatra karne ke liye paryaapt nahin he
 Significantly, in the beginning of the year, the Prime Minister of the country had created political earthquake by talking about 'pakoda employment'
 is mudde par vipaksh ne to bijepi sarkaar ko gheraa hi, soshal media par bhi pradhanmantri kaa yah bayaan surkhiyon main rahaa
 After this statement, Manmohan Singh, the Congress leader and the Prime Minister in the previous UPA government, accused the BJP of taking power with false and exaggerated promises
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki bijepi ne 2014 ke aam chunaavon main 1 karod naukari prati varsh dene kaa vaada kiya, vahiin satta par kabiz hone ke baad 2 lakh naukari dene main bhi bijepi sarkaar puri tarah se vifal sabit hui he

 Why is GST getting so much criticism? According to Modi, out of these promises, according to the data of the Economic Survey for the financial year 2016-17, the unemployment rate in the country is 4 in the financial year 2013-14
 9 fisadi ke str se 2016-17 main 5 fisadi par pahunch gai
 From July 2014 to December 2016, a total of 6 lakh 41 thousand new jobs were created in the country
 vahiin shram mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik july 2011 se disambar 2013 ke dauraan desh main 10 lakh se zyada naukariyaan paidaa kii gayi
 It is natural that the political parties sitting in opposition will try to cash in on this during the general elections
 lihaaja, sattarudh raajnneetik dal kaa in sarkari aankadon par asahaj hona bhi swaabhaavik he
 But is it justified to raise the government's question by raising questions in government elections or questioning the government data to avoid issues? yadi ek ke baad ek sabhi raajnneetik dal karodon naukari kaa vaada kar satta main aa rahe hai or vifal bhi ho rahe hai to aisi sthiti main aankadon main naukari dikhaanaa desh main berogari kii samasya se nipatane kii disha main kitna uchit he? Salman Khurshid took charge on Sunday, within an hour of receiving the foreign ministry
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki padosi or anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ko behatar banane kii pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii duuradrushti ke maddenjar vah apana sarvshereshth dene kii koshish karenge
 Cabinet is a combination of youth and experience: After assuming charge Manmohan Singh, Khurshid said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi have placed a lot of responsibility on my shoulders
 yah meraa saubhaahgya hoga ki main unki ummiido par khara utar sakuun

 ' idhar kuch vakt se kaiyon ke liye yah hairaani kii baat rahi he ki desh kii khatir apni jaan qurbaan kar dene vaale duusare krantikariyon ke mukaable bhagat singh zyada yashasvi or lokapriy kaise ho gaye
 Within a few days after he was hanged, Jawaharlal Nehru openly wondered how "a mere slip of a boy suddenly became so famous by leaping high"? The loop of hanging was not alone in his neck
 unke dost sukhdev or raajaguru ko bhi unheen ke saath faansee di gai thi
 But months before his execution, he was being called "bhagat Singh and others"
 unhen unke saathi shaheedon or echesare (hindustani socialist republican army) ke chandrashekhar aaazaad sareekhe ahm sadasyon ke mukaable zyada tarjeeh bhala kyon or kaise di jane lagi? is sawaal ke thode-bahut jawaab bhagat singh kii hat vaali us tasviir main or use centre main rakhkar chalaai gai gaiyr-maamuli muhim main milte hai
 This picture is very similar to the traditional photographs taken in the studio
 tasviir khinchvaate vakt mahaj 21 saal ke yuva krantikari bhagat singh shant najaron se camere main dekh rahe hai
 Some feel as if they are defying the huge charges against them
 aarope un par yah tha ki ve “mahamahim samraat ke khilaaf jang chhedane or unhen british india kii samprabhutaa se vanchit karne kii sajeesh main mubtila the
 
 
 Bhagat Singh knew that these charges would lead him to capital punishment
 iske baavjood ve apane sir par hat lagaae hue bilkul shant or sanyat the
 This picture became a symbol of perky nationalism
 poster art or calandaron main iskaa chautarafa istemaal kiya jane laga
 On seeing it, it started to appear everywhere on the urban plank of that era
 kaaron or hordingon par, bazaaron main, postaron or kitabon main chaaron taraf
 This picture was so visible that it was often compared to the famous photo of Che Guevara, drawn by Alberto Corda
 donon hi camere kii nigaah se khubasurat dikhaai dete the or unamem vah romance, adarshavaad or balidaan bakhubi jhalkata tha jo krantikariyon kii pahchaan he
 Ironically, both photographs were taken in such a way that they were cut from their historical context
 bhagat singh ke maamle main isaki kuch vajah to yah he ki is tasviir ke khinche jane ke maukey or uddeshy ko lekar khaasi anischitata rahi he
 Some people assumed that it was pulled to stick on a security pass
 kuch duusare logon ne andaja lagaaya ki yah 1929 main unki giraftaar ke fouran baad police ne khinchi thi
 But both things are not right
 12 april, 1929 ke bande maataram ke pannon ke bich chipaaya gaya poster (bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar ke saujany se)shahadat kii shuruyatbhagat singh kii yah tasviir tamaam dekhne waalon par kai alag-alag vajahon se apana asar chhod sakati he
 
 
 His youthful beauty, his precise and stoic look, his fashionable hat, slightly bent, et cetera
 magar is tasviir ke bare main darshanik rolland barth kii shabdaawalee main sochen, to “vah ek baat jo falak se uthati he, tir kii manind usase chodi jaati he or mujhe chirati chali jaati he”, yah tay he ki hamaari ankhon main takataki lagaakar taak rahe is diler noujvaan ko faansee par lataka diya jayega-or yah baat khud use bhi pataa he
 The picture becomes even more effective with the realization that Bhagat Singh had drawn it as a clear political strategy before defying the rule of British India going to decide his fate
 lihaaja is tasviir ko is tarah bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki isane pehle vah bhoomika taiyaar kii or phir khud uskaa ek hissaa ban gai, jisamen unhen ek shahid ke taur par chautarafa sweekaar kiya gaya
 Most people are unaware of this story and hence it is necessary to narrate it
 bhagat singh ke sidhe ankhon main jhaankne ke alaava, is tasviir kii duusari sabase zyada dhyaan khinchne vaali baat yah he unka shandaar or sajila magar jahiraa taur par pashchimi hat
 In September 1928, when it was necessary to change disguise to avoid arrest, Bhagat Singh gave away his hair and turban for wearing this hat
 tasviir ke mashhoor ho jane ke baad yah hat unki pahchaan ban gaya
 His turban-worn pictures have been popular for a few years now
 alabatta gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki 1930 ke dashak main unki sikh pahchaan ko tavajjo di jaati thi
 The infamous picture with such a memorable snicker was taken in the Legislature a few days before the action
 yah sambhawatah 4 april kii baat he
 The place was the studio of Ramnath Photographers at Kashmiri Gate in Delhi
 iskaa intjaam echesare ke sadsy jayadev kapur ne kiya tha, jinhone hamale kii yojana or paimaaish kaa bhi bahut sara kaam kiya tha
 He specifically asked the photographer to take a memorable picture of Bhagat Singh
 unhone kaha tha, “hamaara dost dur ja rahaa he, isliye ham uski shandaar tasviir chaahate hai

 His plan was to throw the bomb at the very moment when the Speaker of the House took the initiative to give his system
 vah kshan 8 april kii subah aa gaya
 At the time the bomb was thrown, a large number of newspaper reporters were present in the Legislature
 saath hi kai siyaasi hastiyaan, hindustani bhi or british bhi, vahaan maujuud thim
 This undoubtedly increased the atmosphere of excitement
 alabatta ramnath photographer ke yahaan tasviir taiyaar hone ke kaam main deree ho gai or kapur karrwai se pehle tasviir nahin laa sake
 Ramnath was also tasked with taking photographs for the police
 unhen puraani dilli ke police thane main bulaayaa gaya, jahaan bhagat singh ko girakratari ke baad le jaaya gaya tha
 These photographs of the police were not revealed, but it is almost certain that they were used, as the police “searched all the hotels in Delhi with photographs of the accused
 ”tikaoo tasveershahadat kii baat bhagat singh ke dimag main chadh gai thi
 He was determined that with his premature death his fight against British imperialism would reach its end
 unhone shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya tha or apane ajij dost jayadev gupta se yah saughandh bhi lee thi ki unki gairmaujuudagi main ve unke parivaar kii dekhbhaal karenge
 They understood how martyrs are made
 bataur patrkaar unke kaam se pataa chalata he ki ve story main jaan daalane ke liye tasviir ke istemaal ke khaase kaayal the
 He assisted in raising material for the "hanging marks of the moon" focused on capital punishment
 isamen unhone kai krantikariyon par lekh likhe the or khaas khyaal rakhaa tha ki lekh ke saath tasviren jarur chhapen
 It is clear from his writings that he had a deep sense of the power of martyrdom
 unhen faansee par chadaaye jane se kuch hi der pehle saathi kaidiyon ne ek note unke paas pahunchaaya, jisamen poocha gaya tha ki kya ve jinda rahanaa chaahate hai
 His reply was- "my name has become a symbol of Hindustani revolution
 
 
 agar main muskaraata hua faansee par chadhataa hum, to isse hindustani maanon ko prerana milegi or ve apane bacchon ko bhi bhagat singh banane ke liye prerit karengi
 In this way, the number of people who sacrificed their lives will increase drastically
 phir samrajyavad ke liye inkulab ke sailaab kaa saamana kar paanaa naammumkin ho jayega
 In this picture of Bhagat Singh played a tremendous role
 baad main jayadev kapur ne yaad karte hue bataaya, “yah bhagat singh kii khwaahish thi, or meri bhi, ki karrwai ke baad in tasveeron ko chapa or dur-dur tak failaayaa jaae
