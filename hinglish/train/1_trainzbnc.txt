 On behalf of the Muslim parties, Meenakshi Arora said that there is no similarity between the main part of the report and the conclusion
 ASI ne mana he ki gupta kaal tak jagah kii prakruti kii pahchaan nahin kii ja sakati thi
 It is incorrect to say that the temple was built in the 12th century
 ise "divya" kaise kaha ja saktaa he? divya yugal kaa naam kaise diya ja saktaa he? gol gumbad ke paas ashtakoniya akruti thim
 The ASI report is just an opinion
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki ASI kii report alag-alag visheshgyon kii alag-alag raay vaali he
 So scientific is less and more based on imagination
 report se kahin sabit nahin hota ki vahaan gupt kaal kaa bhi nirmaan tha
 The palace is being talked about
 nirmaan madhyakaal kaa he
 In such a situation, it is wrong to call him a 12th century temple

 Justice Nazir commented on the arguments of Muslim parties that you cannot question the authenticity of the report

 It is worth noting that the fingerprint check is accurate, because the percentage of matching is considered to be correct
 justise bobade ne kaha ki kya aapke paas koi aisa puraatatv vaigyani jo ASI kii report kaa nakaar sake jaise aap nakaar rahi hai
 To this, Meenakshi Arora said, "the opinion of witnesses appearing on behalf of Hindu side was also outside the Archaeological Department

 On this, Meenakshi Arora said that in the report of the Department of Archeology, nowhere was it said that such a place is a Ram temple
 jabaki ram chabutare ko water tanks bataaya gaya he
 Justice Bobde said that one thing is clear that he had a dispute over possession, but was this dispute only with Ram Pootare or the entire birthplace? Shekhar Nafde, appearing on behalf of Muslim parties, said that Hindus used to worship on some land there
 unka sirf ram chabutare par niyantran tha, ve swaamitv hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe the jise asweekaar kar diya gaya tha
 He tried constantly to encroach
 nafde ne kaha ki vahaan par hinduon kaa simit adhikaar tha or wo usko badhaane kii koshish kar rahe the
 He said that the judicial commissioner had believed that there was limited right of Hindus and they were trying to increase it, but had accepted limited rights of Hindus and did not accept their ownership
 nafde ne kaha ki 1885 ke suut par faijabad kii adaalat kaa faisla hinduon par badhyakaari he
 In this judgment, the court denied construction and other rights to the temple

 Union Minister Uma Bharti: i don't want to comment on the Supreme Court order
 i don't want to comment on the mediators named by the court

 There are many mosques in Ayodhya and Faizabad too, but only Ram temple will be built where there is Ramlala

 Uma Bharti said that the court has said from the beginning that this is disputed land
 yah bhoomi vivaad kaa maamla he or yahaan par aasthaa kaa vivaad to he hi nahin
 Ram birthplace is directly there
 donon partiyaan agar baatcheet kar len to court usko manyata detaa he
 He said that everyone knows that a Ram temple will be built
 vahaan par mandir ke alaava or kuch ho hi nahin saktaa
 Arbitrators also have to understand this
 is fire brands netaa ne aage kaha ki vatican city main koi masjid banane ke prastaav rakh saktaa he kya
 Can a temple be built in Mecca Medina
 isi tarah ramalala main ram mandir ke alaava or kuch nahin ban saktaa
 It would be good for everyone to talk to each other and build a temple on the lines of Somnath

 There is no question of names

 i want to tell the Muslims whether Mecca should be made in place of Medina or something, or are there any Christians allowed in Vatican City if they are not allowed there, then why the Ram temple is so controversial? ' Separated and moved to Pakistan
 pakistan main mandiron ko todaa or giraaya gaya mujhe us par koi aapatti nahin hai
 We have no objection to the three lakh mosques being built in India
 ham kah rahe hai ki ram mandir hamaare liye aasthaa kaa vishay hai
 Rama is revered for us
 babar unke liye aasthaa yaa poojyaneey nahin hai isliye unhen ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye aage aana chahie
 He said that if the Ram temple is not built yet, then the Congress is responsible for it
 pehle pandit nehru ne nahin banane diya or ab kapil sibbal nahin banane de rahe hai
 Two ways to resolve the dispute: KC Tyagi: On the other hand, Janata Dal United (JDU) leader KC Tyagi told Aaj Tak to discuss the formation of an arbitration committee on the Ram temple issue, that the JDU is already believing that to resolve the dispute, two There are ways either through mutual negotiation or through court

 He said that earlier there was an attempt to explain this decision through mutual dialogue

 The problem was almost resolved at that time, but the Congress leadership took a stubborn stance
 ab adaalat ke faisle par nae tareeke se prayaas ho rahaa he
 i hope that after forming this committee, the solution to this problem will come out well
 tyaagi ne kaha ki shrishri ravi shankar ne pehle bhi madhyasthata kii koshish kii thi, lekin vah aage nahin bad paae
 Now those people should be exposed that those who disregard the Constitution keep their stand stubborn
 unke bare main jaankaree janata ke saamne aani chahie
 On the matter of giving 8 weeks time to the arbitrator committee, KC Tyagi said that such disputes, which are also related to people's faith and logic, take time in such cases and timelines are not very important for national unity

 In fact, just before the Lok Sabha elections, once again the BJP is going to get a big shock
 anupriya patel kii party apana dal ne bijepi ko jo ultimatum diya tha, uski miyaad khatm ho chuki he or ab apana dal ne saaf kaha he ki vah ab apana faisla lene ke liye swatantra he
 Now its own party has also begun to understand the political gains and losses and now whether it will stay with the BJP or not, it will be decided soon in the party meeting
 kendriya mantri or apana dal kii mukhiya anupriya patel ne kaha ki bijepi ke saath hamen kuch samasyaayein ain or usko hamane sheersh netritv ke saamne rakhaa bhi or 20 farvari tak hamane unhen samay diya ki in samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kare
 But he did not solve these problems
 darasal, apana dal ne bijepi ko 20 farvari tak kaa ultimatum diya tha ki vah apana dal se baatcheet kar unke jo mudde he, use sulajhaa le, magar bijepi ne abhi tak koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai he
 Anupriya Patel: Isse yahi prateet hota hai ki BJP ko shikayaton se koi lena dena nahi hai aur samasyaon ke samadhaan mein koi ruchi nahi hai isliye Apna Dal ab swatantra hai, apna rasta chun'ne ke liye

 Now we will do whatever the party decides

 The poem by Adam Gondvi, 'I will take you to the street of Chamars', in the whiskey glass in the cashew roasted palette, in the whiskey glass in the cashew roasted palette Ramraj MLA residence is a staunch socialist, smuggler or dacoit is such a great celebration of freedom in the light of Khadi So how have you come in search of a house on the footpath, if you want money, then the government has changed the situation, the people here have the same choice There is rebellion
 i am saying this in hosho-havas
 You have village weather in your files
 Look at the competition, rich and ' In poverty, this is the fundamental flaw of the structure of Gandhism
 Your table is silver
 Your gold is still in the house of Juman
 Do not disturb the realization of Hindu or Muslim
 Do not disturb the feeling of Hindu or Muslim
 Do not touch the spirit of your chair
 Doubt, there is some Mongol hydef who talk, now do not tease that matter was Babur's; Why not burn the house of Jumman again in such a delicate time, where Hitler, Halaku, Jar or Genghis all got destroyed, do not disturb the power of the demons
 Do not tease my religious conscience together against poverty, if there is an empty pot on the cold stove in the house, if there is an empty pot on the cold stove in the house, how can i write incense, the fagoon's drug wanders in our village
 Even the yellow lotus blooms in the dry heart of the heart whenever i look at the eyes of the children, i feel the warmth of the burning body again
 Let the story of love now take the light of the lighted match, now in the heart of the village, Mussalsal Fun suffocates in these adabi idars, they will not have any taste, no boo, nor will there be flowers, of course in long queues of lawns

 During this time, Rishi Kapoor appeared quite energetic as usual
 soshal media par iskaa ek video bhi viral hua tha
 Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is seen to be surrounded by his son-in-law as a PA
 bihar sarkaar ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kar aakhir kaise mukhyamantri maanjhi ne apane damaad ko apana pie rakh liya, yah bada sawaal he
 Although the Chief Minister seems to be avoiding this question clearly, the old rule of the government has become a sore throat
 devendra kumaar mukhyamantri ke apane damaad hai
 By the way, he has been posted as Jitan Ram Manjhi's PA since 2010, when he was a minister in Nitish's cabinet
 lekin ve jithan ram maanjhi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad unke pie kaise bane, is par sawaal uth gaya he
 In fact, it is clearly written in the government circular that no minister or chief minister can make any of his relatives his PA
 ab is sawaal par hangaamaa much rahaa he ki kya niyamon kii andekhi kar khud jithan ram maanjhi ne apane damaad ko apana pie banaaya?jithan ram maanjhi jab is sawaal se ghirte najar aae, to kanni kaat gaye
 All he said was, 'the allegations continue on me
 'darasal, saal 2000 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri rabari devi ne ek niyam banaaya tha, jisamen koi bhi mantri yaa mukhyamantri apane kisi rishtedaar ko apana pie nahin rakh saktaa he
 Even while holding his PA, the Minister or Chief Minister has to give an affidavit that PA is not his relative
 kai mantriyon ne is masale par yah kahkar unki musiibat or badhaa di ki sabhi mantriyon ko is niyam kii jaankaree he
 Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Sushil Kumar Modi has also targeted Manjhi and said that money should be recovered from his PA
 haalanki modi ne yah bhi kaha ki ye nitish kumaar or jithan ram maanjhi ke bich ke tanaav kii vajah se hua he
 Sushil Modi said that the Chief Minister has done this immoral act, which should not only be condemned, but his son-in-law should also be charged the money of the government treasury
 lekin modi ne ajtak se phone par hui baatcheet main yah bhi kaha ye nitish kheme kii sajeesh he, jo jithan ram maanjhi ko hataane par tula he
 However, this matter of the son-in-law of the Chief Minister may take a big political color in the coming times

 The Goa government's proposal to build a second international airport at Mopa in North Goa has divided the state into two
 dakshin goa ke dhani-maani or asardaar log is prastaav ke khilaaf golband ho rahe hai
 For them, this airport will swallow their business and livelihood
 dabolim main goa kaa maujuuda hawaii adda nausena kaa he
 The Airports Authority of India is responsible for managing flights in Dabolim
 kul 1,900 acre jameen main se 35 acre iske sanchaalan ke liye nirdhaarit he
 Manohar Parrikar will complete a year as Chief Minister on 9 March
 unhen apni pasandida mopa hawaii adda pariyojna ko saakaar karne ke liye maanamanouvval ke apane tamaam kaushal ko aajmaana hoga
 In September 2012, Parrikar revived the old proposal to build a Mopa Airport in North Goa, the BJP stronghold, as soon as he sat on the Chief Minister's chair
 san 2000 se yah prastaav dabaa hua tha
 Parrikar believes that having its own airport is necessary for the state's economy largely dependent on tourism
 unhone antarrashtriya naagarik vimaanan sanghathan kii report kaa hawala bhi diya he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki yatriyon kii badhati taadaad or 2014 tak betahasha hawaii yatayaat se nibatane main dabolim hawaii adda puri tarah se sakasham nahin he
 There will be a lot of crowd
 mukhyamantri chaahate hai ki nae hawaii adde par 2015 tak vimaanon kii awajahi shuru ho jaae
 "even if the Dabolim airport gets expanded and improved, it will not be able to handle the increasing number of passengers," he argues
 is taadaad ke 2017 tak 60 lakh se bhi upar nikal jane kii sambhaavna he
 The International Civil Aviation Organization report was released in 2010, citing MOPA as the best option to meet the growing demand for tourism in the state
 7 farvari ko vidhansabha main ek bayaan main parrikar ne dabolim hawaii adda band kiye jane kii sambhaavna se saaf inkaar kiya tha
 He had said, "about 350 crore on the improvement of Dabolim Airport
 kharch hue hai
 After Mopa is operational, there is no question of closing it as the state needs services at both the airports
 ” unhone mopa hawaii adda chaalu hone se pehle uttar or dakshin goa ke bich behatar awajahi ke liye 6 len ke hive kaa vaada kiya he
 Parrikar has received unexpected support from the opposition party Congress in this matter
 vipaksh ke netaa pratap singh rane kaa kahana he ki dakshin goa main hotel maalikon kii lobby mopa hawaii adde kaa virodh karvaa rahi he
 On the contrary, they ask what is the loss of having two airports? If tourists can come to Goa from thousands of kilometers away, why can't they travel another 60 kilometers to reach hotels in South Goa? On the other hand, Mopa's opponents argue that this would disturb the state's economic balance
 ab tak uttar goa apane samudr taton, restaraan or sharaab gharon ke liye lokapriy he, jabaki dakshin goa mehmaannawaaji, seva kshetra tathaa puja sthalon ke liye prasiddh he
 In its report released on February 17, the Forum for Promoting Employment and Entrepreneurship in Goa, an NGO, said, "popular beaches like Colva, Warsaw, Kevalosim and Benaulim in South Goa are more than 60 kilometers away from Mopa
 das saal main dabolim hawaii adda apane aap mar jayega or uske saath hi dakshin goa kaa kaarobaar bhi dafan ho jayega
 "goa's gross domestic product in 2011-12 was Rs

 Goa Commerce and Industry Board President Manguirish Pai Raikar says South Goa's contribution to GDP is higher than North Goa
 unke vichaar main, ''aap do jilon kaa sakal gharelu utpaada alag-alag karke nahin dekh sakate kyonki puraa rajya maharashtra or karnataka ke padosi jilon se bhi chota he
 The only thing i can say is that South Goa gets more money than the money coming from the money-order economy, ie the foreign-based Goans, to their relatives in the state and the mining industry
 ”prastaavit hawaii adde ke khilaaf yah abhiyaan dakshin goa main fatorda se nirdaleey vidhayak vijay saradesai chalaa rahe hai
 "tour operators are advertising that destinations in coastal Maharashtra are closer to Goa airport than they are," he says
 goa paryaton main brands ban chukaa he or ve iskaa phayda uthaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 “A number of village gatherings in South Goa including Benaulim, Seraulim, Kevalosim, Chinchinim, Talaulim, Carmona and Macajana are also opposing the airport
 vyapaariyon, tour agenciyon, taxi operataron, chote hotalon, motalon or restaraan maalikon ne mopa hawaii adde kaa virodh karne ke liye south goa ection forum naam se ek sanghathan bana liya he
 anti-mopa activists are targeting Congress and BJP leaders from Goa and Maharashtra as well as those associated with the real estate industry
 unka aarope he ki inhone mopa ke aasapaas kareeb 30 lakh varg meter jameen kharid lee he
 Wilfred Fernandes, president of the South Goa Action Forum, says, "they will sell this land at a very high price or make big profits by building large residential complexes or hotels on it
" ”ek eemaandaar netaa kii parrikar kii chhavi ke bharose bijepi march 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke garh dakshin goa main send lagane main kaamyaab ho gai thi
 There he won eight out of ten seats
 party ko kul milakar 40 main se choubees siten mili thim
 Parikar, an old supporter of the Congress, had given unprecedented support to Parrikar, dislodging him
 ab agar parrikar mopa antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke paksh main paryaapt janamat nahin bana paae to ho saktaa he ki unke karishme par grahan laganaa shuru ho jaae

 so, do staron par aniyojyata tay kii ja sakati he, jinamein se ek he kanoonee pahalu, or doosraa he naitik pahalu
 On the one hand, while there may be a different decision on the legal responsibility from the higher posts of the judiciary, but on moral grounds the matter is clear like a mirror - that brutal massacre happened in front of them, so some responsibility should be made by the Chief Minister
 
 koi bhi nitivaan vyakti bejhijak naitik uttardaayitv sweekaar kar letaa, koi bhi nitivaan vyakti kam se kam apane sabase kareebi vyakti ko mantri ke rup main niyukt nahin karata, jise doshi qaraar diya ja chukaa ho, or vastutah aajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai ja chuki ho
 But Modi does not take any responsibility - not even moral responsibility
 balki, unhone narsanhaar shuru hone ke ek maheene baad tak to raahat or punarvaas kaaryakramon ke bare main bhi baat tak nahin kii
 It was only after he was almost attacked by the then Prime Minister that he started picking up some unconnected commands

 This communal divide has given Modi a strong advantage in elections - first in Gujarat, and now across the country, but the country has taken a loss
 yah nuksaan jari rahegaa
 
 
 And this is the price to pay when leadership lacks morality

 After the defeat of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha elections last week, the party supremo Mayawati is continuously attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ek baar phir unhone modi ko apane nishane par rakhaa
 Prime Minister Modi had mentioned Bhimrao Ambedkar in his address during the 'mann ki Baat' program on Sunday, a day after his speech, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief's maestro targeted him and said that Babasaheb Ambedkar whose Known as Modi, he is the complete opposite and the use of his name is merely dramatization
 ambedkar ke ulat modilkhanu main party mukhyalay membspismanvayakon kii baithak se pehle mayawati ne kaha, 'modiji ne man kii baat main biaar ambedkar kaa zikr kiya, lekin unki vichaardhaara baba sahib ke bilkul vipareet he
 This is the reason why BJP and RSS were kept away from power for many decades
 saadhe 4 saal ke shashan main bijepi ne sirf naatak hi kiya he, khaskar daliton ko lekar
 On Monday, in a press release issued by the BSP, Modi was fiercely targeted
 bispi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi kii ore se ambedkar ke naam kaa istemaal mahaj dhong or naatakabaaji ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 In the last 4 and a half years of his reign, there has been a lot of drama and pretense of his party and government, especially in the case of Dalits and backward, they will not get any political benefit from such pretense
 modi ne ambedkar ko bataaya preranasrotanarendra modi ne ravivaar ko har maheene pesh hone vaale 'man kii baat' kaarykram main ambedkar ke siddhant ko apane liye prerana bataaya tha
 Modi had said that a lot of people would manipulate people in the name of Ambedkar
 unki harsambhav yahi koshish bhi yahi thi ki garib or pichde tabake ke log apni jindagi main tarakkee na kar saken yaa kuch bhi nayaa na kar saken
 The picture of the new India has completely changed now, this India is Ambedkar's India, the poor and backward India
 'mek in india' ko ambedkar ke siddhant se jodate hue piem modi ne kaha ki ab jab desh main mek in india kaa abhiyaan safaltaapurvak chal rahaa he to ambedkar ji ne audyogic shakti ke rup main bharat kaa jo sapana dekha tha, unka hi vijan hamaare liye prerana he
 Years ago, Ambedkar spoke of the industrialization of India and for him industry was an effective medium in which employment could be provided to the poorest of the poor
 mayawati modi ke is bayaan se khush najar nahin ain
 He said that Modi took the name of Ambedkar, but the people of this community are being suppressed
 rajyasabha main bhimrao ambedkar kii haar iskaa sabase nayaa udhaaharan he
 He was referring to the defeat in the Rajya Sabha election in UP last week due to his party's candidate Ambedkar being fielded by BJP as additional candidate
 bispi kii ore se kaha gaya ki baba sahib ambedkar kaa samtamulak or maanavtaavaadi soch kaa bharat bijepi or aresas and company ke raaj main to kabhi nahin ban saktaa, kyonki inaki soch samvidhan kii mansaa ke khilaaf atyant hi sankeern, jativaadee or ghor sampradayik he

 tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je
 Jayalalithaa is struggling with her health concerns in the intensive care of Apollo Hospital in Chennai
 lekin unhone apni party eiediemke ke bhavishya ko lekar anischitata or rajya kii siyasat main uthal-puthal paidaa kar di he
 This is because his party is 'dominated by a woman'
 party apni sari takat or jalawaa unheen se hasil karti he
 He has only one main rival party DMK in the state, led by ninety-four years of life and wheel-chair-bound M
 karunanidhi kar rahe hai
 Ironically, it was Karunanidhi's weekly column in the dmk's mouthpiece Murasoli, which caused an influx of leaders of opposing parties to visit him in the hospital
 apane kollam main unhone maang kii thi ki sarkaar mukhyamantri (ve 22 sitambar se hi aspataal main bhartee hai) kii tasviren jari kare or unki sehat ke bare main bataae
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Union Urban Affairs Minister M
 venkaiya naidu or yahaan tak ki khud diemke ke em
 K
 stallin, jo tamilnadu vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa or karunanidhi ke tisare bete hai, sabhi unka haalchaal poochne ke liye aspataal pahunch gaye
 Outside the hospital, troupes of his loyalists are being guarded in turn
 udhar, mukhya sachiv kii kursi se ritair huin shila baalkrishnan kii aguai main unke sahaayakon kii mandali fort saint jorge (vidhansabha bhawan) se ammaa ke apane khaas andaaj main prashasan kaa kaamkaaj sambhaal rahi he or pakkaa kar rahi he ki rajkaaj main koi kami na rah jaae
 His personal assistant Sasikala Natarajan holds the Gaddinshin AIADMK and is looking after the party
 unhone dur-dur tak apane bhediyon kaa jaal bicha rakhaa he
 His loyal ministers are working as special assistants in the offices of the ministers as well as detective work
 afasarshahi main bhi unke karinde kaam karte hai jise kuch afasar makhul udaate hue 'mannargudi mashin' kehete hai
 He refers to the place from where Sasikala and her family come
 jayalalita ke kaam karne kaa andaaj unke ammaa ke aabhamandal se niklaa he jo sarvyaapee 'maa' ke roopak kaa pratik he or usase bhi aage chalaa jaataa he
 He has let rumors and royalty determine the bottom line of his life and deliberately nurtured it as part of his aura
 unki bahaduree ke liye unki tarif kii jaati he or ve satta kaa jis tarah istemaal karti hai, uske liye unki puja kii jaati he
 Also, the condition of their loneliness is taken advantage of
 lekin unhen koi bevakoof nahin bana saktaa or na hi ve apane jamaane kii ghisi-pity filmi nayika hai
 He has achieved success in public life by battling his fortune
 baavjood iske ki unhen tamil filmodyog or apane maardarshak em
 Yes
 ramchandran ke haathon shoshan or takaliphen sahani padi thim
 But she stood firmly in front of all the mess
 yahaan tak ki mjiaar ke dah sanskaar main unke virodhiyon ne baqayada unase jhagada kiya tha
 Eventually she emerged as the leader of the poor and was seen as 'the messiah like MGR'
 beshak satta main aate hi ve ghamandi ho gayi
 In order to keep the sycophantic common people from the policy of sam-daam-dandi-bheda, they also kept away the remaining symbols of democracy
 yahi unhone sarkaar chalaane main bhi kiya
 Only the purpose was important, whatever the way to achieve it
 is maamle main ve mjiaar ke nakshekadam par chalin, jinhone mukammal bandobast kiya tha ki bhrashtachar puri vyavastha main fail jaae
 But with all this, there was a mix of populist programs, revisions and public welfare measures for the benefit of poor sections
 is maamle main bhi jayalalita kii apil karunanidhi se koson aage hai or isaki vajah he, auraton ke saath unke dil ke taar milte hai
 Jayalalithaa has ensured that he is remembered as a ruler rather than an actress after her
 unhone apane uttaradhikaar kii koi tayshuda yojana nahin banaai, par mote taur par mahilaon or bacchon ke liye dil kholkar kalyankari kaarykram chalaae
 Perhaps this is the reason why he did not decide his political heir who would advance the politics of AIDMK
 unhone apana puraa dhyaan khud apana 'akvama kaa aabhamandal' taiyaar karne main lagaaya taaki dravid siyasat ke mahanayakon main andolan ke sansthaapak periyar, anna (purv mukhyamantri si
 N
 annadurai) or puraachi talaver mjiaar ke baad hameshaa jayalalita kaa naam liya jaae
 Perhaps through this, he also tried to circumvent the role of his arch rival Karunanidhi
 eiediemke or tamilnadu ke logon ko aaj jayalalita kii jarurat usase kahin zyada he jitani khud jayalalita ko unki jarurat he
 In the 2016 assembly elections, he had insisted at every rally that for these people, "I sacrifice my life
" '' isiilie unke samarthak mannaten, upwas, prarthana kar rahe hai, bacchon ke chehre chhidwane jaise anokhe kaam kar rahe hai taaki unki sehat ke liye duaen maang saken (haalanki dravid andolan kii shuruyaat hi murti puja ke khilaaf or is kism ke taur-tareekon ko thukrakar hui thi)
 This also raises the question — who after Jayalalithaa? —which can also lead to the beginning of the post-dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu
 ek nae daur main kadam rakhana behad mushkil ho saktaa he, kyonki agle vidhansabha chunaav agar apane tay samay par hue to abhi saadhe chaar saal dur hai
 Will the mlas want elections so soon, whether they belong to AIADMK or any other party? AIADMK has its earlier ways to show the way when the Chief Minister fell ill and was accused of failing the constitutional machinery, especially the way Jayalalithaa handled mgr's legacy
 eiediemke main uthalputhalyah tay he ki shashikala kaa gut satta par apni pakad banaae rakhane ke liye or eiediemke kii sarkaar ko gaddi se utaarne kii diemke yaa dusron kii kisi bhi koshish ko naakaam karne ke liye koi kasar nahin uthaa rakhega
 It is estimated that Sasikala has full control over at least 60 mlas and 12 ministers are acting as her shadow in the government
 vidhansabha chunaavon ke ummidavaaron ke chayan, mantriyon kii or yahaan tak ki mantriyon ke nijee sahaayakon kii niyukti main bhi unki suni jaati thi
 However, this group will have to work cleanly and it will also need luck to check its interests
 use kisi kaa bhi bharosa hasil nahin he or inamen do baar antarim mukhyamantri rah chuke o
 Panneerselvam also replaced Jayalalithaa
 yah gut nayaa janadesh lene ke liye logon ke bich bhi nahin ja saktaa he, kyonki nepathy se chizon ko anjaam dene kaa uskaa ashobhaneey record rahaa he
 Most likely, all the factions of the party will try to run the state government together with the help of the bureaucracy
 haalanki isse na to shashikala kii mandali ke hit sadhenge or na hi unke remote control se sanchalit duusare logon ke
 Knowing the heartache of the people, Sasikala may prefer to play safe bets on Paneerselvam, though in the absence of Jayalalithaa, her stature will be shortened by the previous shadow
 unke pati natarajan, jinhen ammaa ne haashie par daal diya tha, kutil siyaasi ranneetikaar hai
 Here obviously the AIADMK mlas will do a tremendous loyalty to the power and hence they should not care about where it is coming from power
 ek lihaaj se unhone pehle hi shashikala ko is satta kaa strot maan liya he or is vajah se unase kam se kam darate to hai hi
 Yet Sasikala's troupe may be a target of AIADMK activists, as they have a deep sense of betrayal
 isiilie rajnatik pandit daleel dete hai ki vidhayak kisi bhi kism kii vafadari se bandhe nahin ho sakate hai
 The partition is certain and Sasikala will have to cleverly find a strength to unite everyone and make such a person the chief minister
 is tarah ve nepathy main kaman apane haath main rakhane kii ummid kar sakengi
 Even then it will be a temporary method and the unity imposed will be a big thing even if the year goes on
 is bich ve dakshini jilon kii mukkuletor jati ke tamge ke neeche vidhayak dal ke ek khaase bade hisse ko jode rakhane kii koshish kar sakati hai, jisane pehle bhi eiediemke supremeo ko baari chunavi samarthan diya he
 But it is also likely to be grabbed by other caste-based vote banks like Gondar in western Tamil Nadu
 basharte donon jatigat samudaay laabh kaa bantwaaraa karne par raji ho jaaen jisamen shashikala kaa vafaadaar mukhyamantri bane or gonder jati se aane vaale loksabhaa ke dipti spikar em
 Thambi Durai's height should be made the party's surveyor in Delhi
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki shashikala kii mandali bijepi ke saath saudebaaji kar le, jisane soobe kii siyasat main paanv pasaarna shuru kar diya he
 The BJP will also gladly join it, which has to increase its strength in the state
 rashtriya judaavon ke saath vikalp ke taur par ubharne kii bijepi kii mahatvakanksha ko post or kamjor eiediemke khaasi oochaal de sakati he or is tarah vah tamilnadu kii siyasat main bhi ek bade congress virdohi garh ko apane saath jod sakati he
 Sasikala can also follow Jayalalithaa's plan and field Sheila Balakrishnan as a trump card to suppress dissent and protest within the party and thus ensure a full five-year term without much trouble
 mantri bhi shila se waakif hai or unka hukum maanane main gurej nahin karenge
 However, Balakrishnan may not be ready to join the game
 ek or sambhaavna diggaj netaa panaruti ramchandran hai jo diemke ke kattar virdohi hai, lekin ve paneerselvam kii tarah sidhe-sade or lacheele nahin hai
 On the other hand, DMK is currently on its way to wait and see
 uskaa pehla kadam vidhansabha bhang karne kii kisi bhi koshish ko naakaam karnaa hoga
 For this, she can woo a section of AIADMK mlas, who have invested a large amount in fighting elections this year
 ye vidhayak badale hue halaat main stallin ke samarthan kaa vikalp bhi chun sakate hai, kyonki haal hi main unhen party kaaryakartaaon or matadaataaon kii yuva peedi main kamobesh sweekaar kiya jane laga he
 The DMK will take complete precaution on its part that the aiadmk's possible quarrel does not bring the collapse of the administration in the state, which results in President's rule and gives the BJP a chance
 eiediemke kaa imtihaan diemke kii dakhsandaji or chhedchhad se nibatane main hoga, jo tuutane vaale dhade ko satta kaa laalach dekar samarthan kii peshkash kar sakati he
 Analyst n
 satyamurti kehete hai, ''eiediemke ke kisi bhi nae dhade kii kamyaabi yaa naakaami puri tarah nai afasarshahi ke niyamon ko sweekaar karne par nirbhar karegi, kyonki ve ammaa kii tarje-hukumat par kaam karte hue kaamyaab hone kii ummid nahin kar sakate
 a lot also depends on whether the DMK can unite under Stalin
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''sarkaar hone ke naate centre ghatnakram par asar daal saktaa he lekin bijepi kaa netritv nahin, jise rajya main sweekaarya or bharosmand netritv abhi saamne rakhana he
 "jayalalithaa always relied on a centralized style of control over the party and the government, in which only her personality mattered
" unhone ek jabardast network banaaya tha jo party or sarkaar kii nigaraanee or niyantran karata tha
 Even at times he himself had to resist and keep it under control
 apane maardarshak mjiaar kii tarah unhone bhi afasarshahi par zyada bharosa kiya tha
 In return, they too respected and respected him
 bhashaa par unki pakad, vakpatutaa, saumyata or eiediemke ke kaaryakartaaon ko kaabo main rakhane kii unki kaabiliyat se afasarshahi bhi unke aage shraddha or dar se jhuki rahati thi
 He never relied more on the ability of his legislators
 afasar haaavee the or ve rajkaaj ke taur-tareekon or baarikiyon ke bare main mantriyon ko bataate the ki kya karnaa he
 She also relied on her own channel to get information about excesses and disturbances
 majboot dhanchraham baat yah he ki afasarshahi ko duusare rajyon kii banisbat yahaan hameshaa zyada aazaadee hasil rahi he, kyonki dravid partiyaan saamaanya kaamkaaj or prashasnic kaaryon main centre sarkaar ke saath charchaa or baatcheet karne ke liye unheen par nirbhar karti rahi hai
 In this affair, the bureaucracy is divided between the DMK and the AIADMK and there is an agreement between the two, in which both parties recognize and accept officers with a strong inclination towards themselves and the other party
 haalanki donon partiyaan behad bhrasht hai or afasarshahi bhi donon kii is saajha khubi se waakif he
 However, the style of the two parties' governance and relationship with the bureaucracy is quite different
 diemke kii hukumat main dakhsandaji or anadhikarik nirdesh bahut zyada hua karte the or dabaav bhi bahut hota tha, kyonki mantri baari rob-daab ke saath kaam karte the or afasarshahi ko rukaawat yaa mahaj hukum bajaane vaala maanate the
 The AIADMK ministers are mostly subdued due to their poor background and are always afraid of Khusrafusar as the sycophant of the party supremo that the discussion of his people will go far
 jayalalita unhen aae din badal detii hai, isane bhi unke mantriyon main dar ko or pukhta kar diya he
 The government can run without going to the Fort St
 George of the Chief Minister
 suba mjiaar ke jamaane se hi iskaa aadi ho chukaa he
 During Jayalalithaa's tenure, she has seen this happen from home or while she was in Bangalore jail, or recently from the hospital
 tamilnadu kaa prashasan itane lambey samay se auto mod main rahaa he ki rajkaaj kaa bhavishya kaamkaaj chalaane vaali team or bharosa jagaa sakane vaale sarkaar ke ek chehre par aakar tik gaya he
 Actually, the next few years can be under the rule of the bureaucracy, just like it happened during the Chandrashekhar government in Delhi in 1990-91
 khadaanon kii lij tathaa sarkaar-sanchalit tmasi main sharaab mangavane sareekhe ghotaalon or naakaamiyon ke baavjood rajya ke prashasan kaa dhyaan vikaas or aarthik vruddhi par rahaa he

 The state is ahead in manufacturing in the fields of automobiles, textiles, clothing, medicine, leather, IT and ITES
 ''isamen kuch yogadan us 'ammaa' brands kii chizon kii khayraat baantne kaa bhi he jise aksar 'muftakhori kii sanskrit' kahkar khaarij kar diya jaataa he

 ) Others see it differently and strongly oppose it

 devsahaayam kehete hai, ''jayalalita ne kalyaan ke naam par rajya ko kangaal bana diya he
 At the same time, political culture like slaves and civil servants have been promoted

 It will shatter after Jayalalithaa
 ghotaalon kaa koi sani nahin he or sarkaar harek str par bhrashtachar ko ijaajat detii he
 By promoting open buying and selling of votes, they have nested the purity and honesty of the election process
 '' haalanki satyamurti daleel dete hai ki mjiaar kii eiediemke ke hi jamaane se sirf netaa hi chunaav harata or jeetta he
 Describing the state as the leader of the nation, he says, "there may be nothing else, but other regional parties and leaders, be it Modi or Mayawati, Mamta, Nitish or Naveen, all have some In some way, we have adopted the model of Tamil Nadu and have adopted development and dictatorship in a democratic manner

 Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday compared Narendra Modi to Hitler in Gujarat, to which the BJP reacted sternly that if anyone drew inspiration from Hitler in independent India, it is Indira Gandhi, the grandmother of the Congress Vice President who imposed Emergency in the country
 bijepi ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha, apatkaal main indira ji kaa har kadam hitler ke shashan se prerit tha
 There is only one basic distinction between the two
 hitler ne vanshavaad ko badhaava nahin diya kyonki uske paas aisa karne ke liye koi tha hi nahin
 He said, he heard Rahul Gandhi's speech in Gujarat in which Rahul compared Modi to Hitler
 jetali ne kaha, ‘1975 main jab apatkaal laga to rahul ekadam yuva rahe honge
 But he will not be ignorant of what happened in those 19 months
 ’bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘hitler or indira gandhi ke bich samanta chaunkaane vaali he
 Jaitley said that Hitler imposed emergency in Germany when he came to power in 1933, saying that Communists were setting fire to government buildings, which later investigations proved to be wrong
 ’unhone kaha, ‘indira gandhi ne bhi 26 june 1975 ko yah kah kar desh main apatkaal lagaaya ki jepi andolan main sashastr balon se kaha ja rahaa he ki ve sarkaar ke avaidh adeshon kaa paalan nahin karen
 Announcing the 20-point economic program, Indira Gandhi claimed that an emergency was imposed to speed up discipline and development in the country
 ’bijepi netaa ne kaha ki hitler ne bhi 25 sutri aarthik kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Jaitley said Hitler did not have a two-thirds majority in Germany's parliament
 aise main vipaksh kii shakti kam karne ke liye usne vipaksh ke 91 saansadon ko giraftaar karvaa liya or samvidhan main sanshodhan karke purna shakti hathiyaa lee
 He said, 'indira Gandhi also arrested a large number of opposition mps and brought the 42nd black amendment to the constitution
 yahi nahin unhone ek kadam aage jate hue sansad kii kaarywahi ke prakaashan par bhi pratibandh laga diya
 The BJP leader said that both Hitler and Indira Gandhi imposed emergency on their own and imposed censorship on the press and also suspended fundamental rights like life and liberty
 unhone kaha, ‘indira gandhi ke atarni general ne supreme court main tark diya ki jivan tathaa swatantraaa ke adhikaar ke abhaav main ek kaidi kii jail main hatya kii ja sakati he
 And the submissive Supreme Court of that time accepted this argument

 lekin deshbhar ke doctors kuch aise hi sawaal pashchim bengal ek ek hospital main junior doctor ke saath hui marpet ke baad kar rahe hai
 Delhi Medical Association (DMA) official Drs
 wike gupta ne bataaya, '' association kii taraf se 13 june ko dilli ke doctors ne haathon main kaale baij baandhakar or sir par helmet lagaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 But on June 14, leaving the Emergency only, the doctors will remain in full strike
 '' dow
 Gupta says that if the government does nothing on this, then this strike can be extended further
 ve kehete hai, aaj bacchon par agar teacher shaareerik hinsa kare to bacchon ke liye kanoon he, yahaan tak ki maa-baap bhi bacchon par hinsa nahin kar sakate phir doctors ke khilaaf hinsa rokane ke liye koi kanoon kyon nahin?doctor tyaagi ne kendriya mantri harshavardhan ko bhi aade haathon lete hue kaha, kendriya mantri dow
 Harshvardhan calls himself a doctor, at least he should come forward for the benefit of doctors
 lekin ab tak unka koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 He just remembers the Doctors Association during the election
 bas usee samay unhen yaad aata he ki doctor bhi hai baaki samay ve rajaneta ban jate hai
 "mamata Banerjee's statement further provoked the family to attack the hostels with weapons and beat up junior doctors when a person died during treatment at NRS Hospital in the state of fire
 kai gambhir rup se ghayal bhi hue
 Instead of sympathizing with the doctors, the Chief Minister of the state made a statement that if the death of a policeman while doing a job, fellow policemen do not strike, protest
 unhone 13 june ko dopahal 2 baje tak tak sabhi doctoron ko kaam par lautne kaa ultimatum dete hue kaha, aisa na karne vaale doctoron se hostel khaali karvaa liya jayega
 After the nationwide protests, Mamata was softened and doctors across the country demonstrated against the incident in West Bengal
 14 june ko seva band rakhane kaa bhi elaan kiya
 It is probably because of this that Mamta Banerjee posted some photos in her tweeter handle at around 8 pm on 13 June, in which patients were upset due to not getting treatment

 In the case of FDI approval in the retail sector, the Congress, which was forced to retreat due to injury from its own allies, is now seen rolling over the Lokpal bill
 ab yah team anna kii zyaadaatar maangon ko shaamil karne par taiyaar lagati he
 There are mainly three issues on which Team Anna had a disagreement with the government: bringing the Prime Minister, grade-c employees and the anti-corruption wing of the CBI under the Lokpal's purview
 ek varisht cabinet mantri ne india today ko bataaya ki jantar mantar par vipakshi dalon ke bayanon ko sunakar in muddon par sarkaar kamjor pad gai
 The government is willing to bring the Prime Minister within the ambit of Lokpal with few conditions
 13 disambar ko sansad bhawan sthit pradhanmantri karyaalay main hui congress kii kor cameti kii baithak main is masale par muhar laga di gai
 Till now most of the Congress leaders were in favor of the argument that the investigation against the Prime Minister should be approved only after he leaves office
 dilachasp baat yah he ki is maamle main shaayad ekmaatr manmohan singh hai jo pradhanmantri ko jaanch ke daayre main laane ke himachati the
 Despite the support of Congress like NCP and Trinamool to the Congress, the UPA seems to be kneeling as soon as the opposition team goes into Anna's camp
 udhar, anna hajaare ne kaha he ki agar sansad ke sheetakaaleen adhiveshan main prabhavi lokapal bill paarit nahin hua to 1 janvari, 2012 se 'jail baro andolan' kiya jayega
 Not only this, he also threatened to sit outside the house of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 grad-si karmchaariyon ko shaamil karne ke maamle main bhi congress ne palati khai he
 She has retreated somewhat on the CBI question
 jahaan vah desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ko puri tarah lokapal ke adheen nahin laana chaahati, vahiin yah bhi sujhaayaa ja rahaa he ki lokapal, pradhanmantri or netaa vipaksh milakar sibiai ke nideshak kaa chayan karen
 Another symptom of Congress's softening is seen
 ab vah gathbandhan ke apane sahyogiyon par cabinet ke farmaan ladane kii bajaae sarvasammati banane ke mahatv ko mahasoos kar rahi he
 For the first time in the upa's second term, the Prime Minister convened a coordination meeting of allies on December 13 to discuss the Lokpal bill
 upie-1 ke dauraan vamadalon or upie ke bich talmail ke liye baqayada ek samanvay vyavastha thi
 Later, there was no name for it
 epadi main patkhni dene ke baad mamata banerjee ne ek baar phir isaki jarurat kii vakaalat kii
 NCP is also in support of their demand
 congress ke ek mantri ne samanvay kaa samarthan karte hue kaha, ''darasal, ek cabinet mantri ne apane bayaan se bhram paidaakar hamen bhi gafalat main daalaa ki is maamle main mamata se baat ho chuki he
 "as Trinamool Congress's Dinesh Trivedi pointed out," negotiation does not necessarily mean consent
 ''isse pehle ki lokapal bill sansad main aata, cabinet ne aanan-fanan main judicial accountibility, hvicil blor or citigens charter bilon ko paas kar diya
 These three issues were on Team Anna's list
 is tarah ek baar phir congress kaa apane sahyogiyon ke saath talmail kaa abhaav ujagar hua or trinmul or ensipi donon ne sonia gandhi ke chaheta khaadya suraksha bill ko cabinet main dher kar diya
 Sharad Pawar's objections to this issue are not new
 lekin congress is mudde ko cabinet main laane se pehle unhen aashwast nahin kar pai
 This time not only the opposition, but also its Congress allies are not behind in piercing it

 smartphone market main in dinon nokia kaa android phone nokia x khub charchaa main he
 Discussion is also possible because it is the first Android phone launched by Nokia, but if you are planning to buy it, then tell that it is slightly different than other Android phones
 asal main nokia ke is phone main bhi company ke windos yaa simbian technology par aadhaarit smartphone kii chhap he
 Of course, Nokia's x phone at the Mobile World Congress also faded away the brightness of Samsung's s5 due to its price range, but the time will tell how much this phone will appeal to the user in the market
 1
 Android 4
 1 jaili been to he lekin
 
 
 4 of Android in this Nokia phone
 1 jaili been varjan he, lekin bataa den ki company ne isamen kai pherbadal bhi kiye hai
 Users may miss the lack of many Google products compared to the common Android phone
 haalanki un product ko APK files ke jariye downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 2
 app store he lekin
 
 
 Android operating system is Google's product
 aise main nokia ne iske istemaal main google app store ko gaayab kar diya he
 Obviously, the Android user will miss the Google app
 iske alaava phone main jimail, krom or google map kii suvidha ko hataakar microsoft outluk, exange or nokia express broujar ke saath hear maps kii suvidha di gai he
 3
 yujar interphes main bhi he ek lekin
 
 
 The user interface of the phone has also been changed
 yah phone aam android phone kii tarah yujar se interect nahin karata
 Nokia has also used an interface that looks like Windows Phone in its phone
 4
 There is also a back button but
 
 
 aam taur par bazaar main dikhne vaale sabhi tach android phone main back batan ke alaava teen batan kaa le-out rahata he
 But on the lines of its Asha series, Nokia has preferred only one back-button layout in this phone
 5
 New app store but
 
 
 google app ke mukaable nokia ne phone main khud kaa app store dawalp kiya he
 However, in comparison to the number and choice of apps in the Google app, Nokia's app store seems a little weak
 Google kaa is saal kaa sabase bada event maid bai google kal yojit kiya jayega
 In this event, the company will launch its flagship smartphones Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL
 is dauraan company kuch nae products bhi launch kar sakati he
 Since the flagship of Apple and Samsung have entered the market and now the path to Google is not easy
 kyonki iphone x main kai saare krantikari badlaav kiye gaye hai or google ke nae picksal main kya kuch aise badlaav dekhne ko milenge yaa nahin yah bada sawaal he
 However, pictures of Google Pixel 2 have been leaked and shared by Ivan Blass on Twitter
 aapako bataa den ki unke dwaara aakhri samay par post kii gai photo har baar sahi hoti he
 Therefore, you can understand the picture you are seeing as Google Pixel 2
 iske alaava pehle bhi isaki kai tasviren or spacifications li hote rahe hai
 In this picture, a covered phone is visible, which is quite large
 lekin duusari licd tasveeron main back panel bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 The Eback panel is dual toned, but does not feature a dual camera, which has become a trend in flagship smartphones
 licd image yah saaf he kii Google Pixel 2 XL main disple kaa aspect reshyo 18:9 kaa hoga
 Apart from this, the other variant will have an aspect ratio of 16: 9 and a 5-inch full HD display will be given in it
 home screen main bhi badlaav dekha ja saktaa he yani is baar nayaa launture bhi launch kiya jayega
 It has a back glass finish, ie this time wireless charging support can also be found
 home screen par google search baar pichhali baar upar kii taraf tha, lekin is baar yah neeche dekha ja saktaa he
 Obviously Android 8 Oreo will be given in it and it will not have any bloatware in it
 sirf dizin or tasviren nahin balki isaki keemten bhilik ho rahi hai
 According to a report by Droid Life, the Pixel will cost $ 649 (about Rs 42000), while its 128GB variant will cost $ 749 (about Rs 49,000)
 Pixel 2 XL kii keemat 849 dollar (55,750 rupee) se shuru hogi or 949 dollar iske 128GB vairient kii keemat hogi
 That is, this time the company will launch an expensive smartphone like iphone X, because the price of iphone x is $ 999

 supreme court sharia yani muslim kanoon ke mutabik ladki ko yauvanasthaa shuru hote hi vivaah ke adhikaar par amal karne vaali yachika kaa pareekshan karne ko taiyaar ho gaya he
 Muslim law considers a girl to be married at the age of 16, so she has the right to marry
 darasal, uttar pradesh kii ek ladki ne isi aadhaar par shaadi kii tay sanvaidhanik umr 18 saal hone se pehle kiye gaye apane vivaah ko vaid ghoshit karne kii guhaar court se lagaai he
 The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the petition, in which a minor Muslim girl has said that she has married according to Muslim law
 vah puberty (rajaswala hone) kii umr paa chuki he or apni vaivaahik jindagi jeene ko aaazaad he
 Please tell that the girl has challenged the Allahabad High Court's decision in the Supreme Court
 hoicourt ne ladki kii shaadi ko shunya qaraar dete hue use shelter home main bhejne kaa aadesh diya tha
 The SLP petition filed in the Supreme Court states that he is married
 aise main use daanpaty jivan basar karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 Actually this is the case of Ayodhya in UP
 supreme court ke justise envi ramana, justise indira banerjee or justise ajay rastogi kii bench ne is maamle main daakhil arji par sunwaayee ke dauraan ise vistaar se sunne ke liye sahmati dete hue upi sarkaar ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 In fact, after the girl's age was 16 years at the time of marriage, the Ayodhya lower court said during the hearing of the case that since the girl is a minor, she should be sent to the shelter home
 ladki ne elahabaad hoicourt main arji daakhil kar nichali adaalat ke faisle ko chunauti di
 Then the Allahabad High Court also upheld the lower court ruling that since the petitioner girl is a minor and does not want to live with her parents, the order to send her to the shelter home is correct
 is aadesh ke saath hi hoicourt ne shaadi ko shunya qaraar de diya
 The petition of this woman argues that under Islamic law, a girl is usually free to take a decision about her life at the age of 15, ie, menstruation
 yani wo apni pasand ke kisi bhi vyakti se shaadi karne main sakasham he
 The girl, in a petition filed through her lawyer Dushyant Parashar, said that the High Court had failed to accept the fact that her marriage was done as per Muslim law
 yachika main ladki ne apane jeene, dharmik manyataon kaa paalan karne or swatantraaa ke adhikaar kii raksha ke liye daleel di he ki vah ek yuvak se prem karti he or is saal june main muslim kanoon ke anusaar unka nikaah ho chukaa he
 After the alleged marriage, the girl's father filed a kidnapping case against the boy
 ladki ke pita ne police ko darj karai gai shikaayat main kaha ki ek yuvak ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar uski beti kaa apharan kar liya he
 However, the girl has stated in her statement filed before the magistrate that she has married the person on her own free will
 vah uske hi saath rahanaa chaahati he
 On June 24, a court in Bahraich of UP had said that according to Indian law, the girl's age has not been married
 court ne ladki ko 18 saal kii umr puri karne tak bal kalyaan kamity, baharich ke paas bhej diya tha
 On this, the girl's husband filed a habeas corpus petition before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, the bench rejected the petition of the girl's husband, saying that the girl would be considered a minor under the Juvenile Justice (care and Protection) Act
 lihaaza yah shaadi amaanya he
 The High Court agreed with the lower court's decision and sent the girl to the Woman Shelter Home
 ab supreme court is vivaad ko nae nazariye se sunegaa
 That is, the law of the country and which of Islamic law will be applicable to the Muslim population, when and how it will be clear

 ' franz kafka
 The German writer Franz Kafka was born on July 3, 1883, into a middle-class German-speaking Bohemian Jewish family in Prague
 vah beesvin sadi ke sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee kathakaar or saanskrithik rup se samajhadaar lekhak the
 He influenced an entire generation
 unki rachanaaon ke anuwaad puri duniya main hue, jinamein bhartiya bhashaaen, or pramukh rup se hindi bhi shaamil he
 What to say about his short stories, stories and novels? Kafka was adept at telling his words in fewer words
 khaas baat yah ki vah har haal main sangharshrat maanav ke paksh main the
 Despite all the opportunities Kafka spent his life in search of loneliness, internal strife and faith, see this story called 'disha', translated by Sukesh Sahni - "'very sad,' said Rat
 'the world is getting smaller day by day
 pehle yah itani badi thi ki mujhe bahut dar lagata tha
 i kept running and when i finally started seeing my right and left walls, i was happy
 par yah lambii deevaaren itani teji se ek duusare kii taraf bad rahi hai ki main palak jhapakate hi aakhir chor par aa pahunchaa hoon; jahaan kone main vah chuhedani rakhi he or main uski ore badhata ja rahaa hoon
 '"' Where the direction needs to be changed, that's all
 ' billi ne kaha, or use kha gai
 "can understand how his short stories played his part in the whole world
 unki rachanaaen aadhunik samaaj ke vyagr insaan, uski hadabadi or algaav ko chitrit karatin hai
 Contemporary critics and academics, including respected names such as Vladimir Nabokov, believe that Kafka is one of the best writers of the 20th century
 kafka or unki rachanaaon kaa jalawaa yah tha ki 'kafkaesque' angreji bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaya, jiskaa upyog 'bahakaanewaala', 'khatarnaak', 'jatilta' aadi ke sandarbh main kiya jane laga
 The New Yorker presented Kafka's literary and social contributions philosophically in an article
 lekh ke kuch vaakya yon the, "jab kafka kaa janm hua, tab us sadi ke aadhunik vichaaron ne panapana aarambh kiya- jaise ki sadiyon ke bich main ek nai atmachetana, naepan kii chetana kaa janm hua ho
 Even after so many years after his death, Kafka embodies one aspect of modern ideology — that feeling of worry and shame that cannot be stabilized, therefore cannot be pacified; a feeling of an infinite difficulty within things, which hinders every step; Beyond utility, intense sensitivity, such as social usage and religious belief, is like a body that suffers from every touch when its old skin is stripped away
 "kafka par sabase adhik prabhaav apane pita kaa padaa
 Kafka's father Harmann Kafka ran a large shop in the ghetto and his mother Julie shared his father's hand
 harmann ko us ilaake kaa ek bada, swaarthee va dabang vyapaaree mana jaataa tha
 Franz Kafka himself stated that his father was 'a true Kafka in strength, health, hunger, height of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind and knowledge of human nature'
 yahi vajah thi ki kafka kaa samoochaa vyaktitv vishaal komalta, vicitra va achche hasya, kuch gambhir or aashwast aupchaariktaaon se bharpoor tha
 Look at the image included in this composition called 'window'
 vaise to yah ek laghukatha he
 But it includes the whole life philosophy
 'khidki' kaa anuwaad bhi sukesh saahani ne kiya he
 The story is like this - despite being isolated in life, a person would like to connect to some extent somewhere
 din ke alag-alag samay, mausam, kaam-dhandhe kii dasha aadi main use kam se kam ek aisi snehil baanh kii ore khulne vaali khidki ke bagaiyr bahut adhik samay tak nahin rah sakegaa
 Despite the state of mind of not doing anything, he moves towards the window with weary footsteps and begins to stare blankly at people and sometimes at the sky, his head slowly tilts backwards
 is sthiti main bhi sadak par daudte ghode, unki baggiyon kii khadkhad or shorgul use apni ore khinch lenge or antat vah jivan-dhara se jud hi jayega
 The inconsistencies of Franz Kafka's life, the infinite merit, the sensations of art and words make him a great storyteller and artist
 vah apane bheetar ke pratirodh or gambhir sanshay ke khilaaf sangharshrat lekhak the
 Kafka's well-read and popular works in Hindi include 'kayapalat', 'chekha', 'A Hungry Artist', and 'mahal' etc
