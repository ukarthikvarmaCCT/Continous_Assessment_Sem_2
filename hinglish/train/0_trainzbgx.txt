 congress adhyaksharahul gandhineraphelsaude ko lekar centre keemodi sarkaarper jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 In Bengaluru on Saturday, he said that Kikangress would take this issue to the streets across the country
 congress ladegi aapaki ladaairahul gandhi ne hindustan aronutics limited (HAL) ko airospes ke kshetra main ek 'samrik sampatti' bataate hue modi sarkaar par is sarkari company ko nasht karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He told the employees of HAL, ‚Äúrafael is your right
 ham is mudde ko bharat kii gali-gali main le jaaenge, ham echeel ke saath khadey honge or yah ladaai ladenge, hamavayusenake saath khadey honge or yah ladaai ladenge
 "rahul Gandhi accuses Modi government," Institutions of modern India are being attacked and destroyed
 rafel aapkaa adhikaar he, aap 78 saal puraani company hai
 You have been working for more than 70 years
 yadi koi yah sochataa he ki ve aapaki kabr par khadey ho kar apana bhavishya bana sakate hai, to aisa hone nahin diya jayega
 It is completely ridiculous for the government to say that HAL does not have the necessary experience
 "rahul gandhi ne raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman par aarope lagaaya, "vah france gayi hai taaki vahaan ise (saude main kathith bhrashtachar ko) dhanka ja sake, lekin aisa nahin hoga kyonki sachai saamne aa rahi he
 i am saying very clearly that corruption has happened, bribery has taken place, 30 thousand crores rupees have been taken and given to Anil Ambani
 yah paisa echeel ke karmchaariyon se chhina gaya
 "the debt president of Desh HAL, the Congress president further said," Those who have laid down their lives, those who stood for this country are feeling emotionally distressed because they have been insulted
 echeel ne desh ke liye shandaar kaam kiya he or hamaari hifaazat karne or ek vaigyanik drushtikon dene ke liye desh iskaa karjadaar he
 i think you have suffered and i want to stand with you in this state of disgust
 echeel ke paas rafel banane kii kshamta he lekin raksha kshetra kii sarkari company ko nasht karne kii koshish kii ja rahi
 Its employees are feeling hurt and frustrated
 "rahul ne raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, "ve echeel ke paas anubhav kii kami ke bare main baat karti hai lekin kya unhone anil ambani ke anubhav ke abhaav ke bare main kuch kaha he, jinhone apane jivan main kabhi ek vimaan tak nahin banaaya he
 HAL has no debt while Anil Ambani has a debt of Rs 45,000 crore
 echeel 78 saal se kaam kar rahi he
 At the same time, Anil Ambani's company is 12 days old
 isliye unhone (sitaraman) ne us vyakti ke khilaaf koi tippanee nahin kii jise anubandh mila he
 They have to speak about the experience of HAL
 "rahul ne rafel saude ko lekar modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki francisi airospes company daso aviation ke saath hue is saude main anil ambani kii company ko praathamikta dekar echeel kii andekhi kii gai
 Significantly, the opposition party is accusing the Modi government of benefiting Anil Ambani's Reliance Defense Limited from this deal
 congress is bare main bhi jawaab maang rahi he ki sarkari company echeel ko is saude main shaamil kyon nahin kiya gaya, jaisaa ki samprag sarkaar ke dauraan saude ko antim rup die jane ke dauraan tha
 The Congress has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of snatching employment from the people of Karnataka by not giving HAL a contract

 Senior BJP leader LK Advani also praised Modi but Advani also praised Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister bjp's Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 modi ne ravivaar ko congress, centre sarkaar or nehru-gandhi parivaar par sidhe hamale kiye
 He said that the central government is not keeping the interest of the country in mind and the Congress party never tried to develop the nation, but it always paid attention to the interests of 'one family'
 bhaajapa kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke prabal daavedaar samajhe ja rahe modi ne kaha, "aaj jabaki bahut se desh vikaas ke liye koshish kar rahe hai, bharat sabhi sambhaavnaaon ke baavjood peeche he
 Why? Because they (congress) do not want the country to develop
 " Without naming anyone, he directly attacked the nehru-gandhi family and Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party vice-president Rahul Gandhi, saying, "it is the tradition of the Congress to sacrifice for one family rather than sacrifice for the country
" " Modi even called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, leader of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) party, a 'night watchman'
 modi ne kaha, "unhone (sonia-rahul) manmohan singh ko pradhanmantri banaakar vastav main ek chaukeedaar niyukt kiya he
 " modi ne aage kaha, "desh ko congress shashan se mukt karana rashtrabhakti hogi
 This is as big a responsibility as our freedom fighters
 " unhone kaha, "congress desh main dimak kii tarah fail gai he
 It is difficult to overcome
 iskaa keval ek hi ilaaj he or vah he bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon kii mehnat kaa pasinaa
 " idhar, modi ke hamalon se chot khai hui congress ne palatwaar kiya he
 In response to the Congress terming it as termite, party leader Mani Shankar Aiyar called Modi a 'snake'
 tippaniyan Calling the party workers to oust the Congress from the Center in the next Lok Sabha elections, Modi was seen projecting himself as the Prime Ministerial candidate from the BJP
 modi ne kaha, "vah koun hoga? asli sawaal yah he
 It does not matter to the BJP who will not be there
 " The speech given by Modi on the last day of the National Executive meeting was highly appreciated by the BJP leaders
 ullekhneey he ki bhaajapa ke sheersh netaaon dwaara modi ko 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa kii taraf se pradhanmantri kaa pratyaashee banaae jane kii baat kii jaati rahi he

 Although everyone knows the story of Ranveer Singh's craziness, but his co-star Riddhima Sood has also realized this
 joya akhtar nirdeshit film ‚Äòdil dhadkane do‚Äômain ranvir singh ke saath kaam kar raheen riddhimaa sood is film ke saath jald hi bollywood main kadam rakhanevaali hai
 Riddhima says, 'you would be surprised to know that i used to meet Ranveer Singh in the gym more than the set

 'frankly, i have no idea about shoes

 Significantly, on the night of 28‚Äì29 September, the Indian Army entered into pok and attacked terrorist targets and the army DGMO announced it through a press conference
 is sargical strike main commando ne pioke main teen kilometre tak ghuskar aatanki lonching pads ko tabah kiya tha
 At least 50 terrorists were reported killed in this operation and the Pakistani army, which had come to the rescue of the terrorists, also suffered a great loss in it
 iske baad se daavon or siyasat kaa jaise silsilaa chal padaa

 The Indian Army has given a befitting reply to terrorists as well as Pakistan through surgical strikes
 darasal pakistan adhikrut kashmir main kis tarah se aatanki camp chalaae ja rahe hai iskaa taaja udhaaharan ek video ke jariye saamne aayaa he
 a few days before the Uri attack, terrorists uploaded a video on social media
 yah video pioke se pakistani network ke jariye aplod kiya gaya tha
 In the video near Aaj Tak, the terrorists are seen targeting a PM for the first time
 video main aatanki bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam lekar target karne kii baat kah rahe hai
 In the alleged video, terrorists are also seen shouting slogans of Kashmir's independence and India's ruin
 darasal video main maujuud aatankiyon ko kashmir mujahiddeen kaa naam diya gaya he
 The shocking truth came to light when security agencies and cyber experts investigated the website and the alleged video
 darasal padtaal main website kaa ypi adress or lokation pioke kii nikali, jiskaa network pakistan main bataaya gaya
 In the investigation, it was found that Salman Chaudhary, who is present on social sites, is continuously uploading terrorist videos on Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus
 uri hamale se kuch dinon pehle bhi isi acount se kuch video aplod kiye gaye the
 Cyber experts came to know in the investigation of the account that this account was activated in the year 2014
 jiske baad se is acount se lagataaratanki trainingke video aplod kiye ja rahe hai
 There is also talk on nuclear war, in many of these videos, nuclear war between India and Pakistan is also being talked about in 2016 
 andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pioke main kitne bade paimaane par behad hitech tareeke se kashmir or hindustan ko tabah karne kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 These accounts of alleged websites and social media on the Internet are being run from the same part of pok, where the Indian Army had carried out surgical strikes and destroyed terrorist bases
 paak sena or iesai kar rahi he madadyani yah kahana haragij galat nahin hoga ki pioke main ab hitech tareeke se pakistani sena or iesai kii madad se kashmir or hindustan ke khilaaf jang kaa sajeesh chal rahi he
 In the alleged video, the terrorists are seen taking training in the training camps of terror being run in pok
 vahiin video main aatanki kashmir ko aaazaad karwaane or bharat kii barbaadi tak jang jari rakhane ko lekar bhi narebaaji karte najar aa rahe hai
 Training camps of terror have been flourishing for a long time, let us tell that hundreds of terrorist camps have been flourishing on the territory of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir at the behest of Pakistani Army and ISIK
 aatanki training puri karne ke baad bharat main bade paimaane par ghuspaith karte hai or bekusur logon ko apana nishaanaa banaate hai
 Actually, it has always been difficult for India to rein in these terrorist camps and destroy them
 bhartiya sena ne dikhaaya apana sahasmgar haal hi main bhartiya sena ne apane saahas or parakram kaa parichay dete hue sargical strike ke jariye pioke main chalaae ja rahe kai aatanki thikaanon ko nestnabud kar dikhaaya
 Not only terrorist camps were targeted through surgical strikes, but dozens of terrorists were also killed
 aatanki aakaaon main sargical strike se baukhalaahatgauratlab he ki pioke main ek ore inatankiyonko bharat main hamalon ke liye taiyaar kiya ja rahaa hai, to vahiin duusari ore internet par aatanki training ke video aplod kar yuvaaon ko bhi gumraah kiya ja rahaa he
 However, the manner in which the Government of India has cleared its intentions by carrying out surgical strikes against terrorism, it is clear that the terrorists sitting in the pok are visibly angry

 Even on Sunday evening he came from Uttar Pradesh by drinking liquor and started molesting the elephant
 jisase hathi ko gussa aa gaya or usne pairon se kuchalakar mahavat kii jaan le lee
 Meanwhile, elephant owner Raghuvansh Rai had gone to Bramhapur to buy a horse at the time of the incident
 agle din subah jab vah ghatnasthal shaayar ghat par pahunche to unhone yah najaara dekha
 On receiving the information of the incident, Chausa BDO and Police Station arrived on the spot and took the body in possession and sent it for postmortem
 is dauraan hathi ke maalik raghuvansh raay ne bahut hi aasaani se hathi ko kholkar duusari jagah baandh diya
 However, the forest department officials have been informed of the incident
 vahiin ghatana ko lekar gaanv main tarah-tarah ke charchaae ho rahi he logon kaa kahana he ki yadi mahavat ne sharaab na bhi hoti to shaayad aaj uski maut nahin hui hoti

 aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki sachai ke raste par chalane par is tarah kii dikkatein aati hi hai
 At the same time, Congress leader Rajiv Shukla has described such actions as shameful
 ravivaar kii subah team india bangladesh ke liye ravaanaa hogi to viraat kohli or unki team ke saamne chunauti kuch alag tarah kii hogi
 The Indian team will face the teams of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Afghanistan there and it will get different aspects of its strength
 is toornament se yakeenan bataur captain viraat kohli kii kaabiliyat ke ank die jane shuru ho jaaenge
 Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy style is different
 isaki ek jhalak ipel ke dauraan milti rahi he
 But this time the responsibility given to Virat Kohli will be closely watched by everyone on his decision
 vah dhoni kii tarah kamyaabi ke nae kirtiman banaaenge or team india ko sawaalon ke daur se aage le ja sakenge, ise lekar sabaki dilchaspee bani hui he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli are two different personalities as captain
 ek ne team india ko aitihaasik kamyaabiyaan If administered, one is the hero of tomorrow's hopes
 ek ke naam khitaabon kii lambii fehrist he, to ek se khitaabon kii badi ummid
 Virat Kohli is known for his aggressive attitude
 ballebaaji ho yaa captaini viraat kohli apana tevar barkaraar rakhte hai
 Whereas in the last nearly seven years, Team India has got into the habit of a captain who keeps in mind the decisions of strategy players on the field and looking ahead
 lekin captain kool ke chehre par ise pard paanaa kabhi aasaan nahin rahaa he
 At the same time, Virat Kohli has a different style
 vah aakraamak hai or apni bhavanaaen chhipate nahin
 The special thing is that Virat Kohli's decisions during the captaincy of the Under-19 to IPL and Team India have not been questioned so far
 jabaki dhoni ke faislon ko lekar world cap se lekar ab tak kai baar sawaal uthe hai
 Dhoni has forced the veterans to retreat several times with big results, but this time Rahul Dravid to Sourav Ganguly are questioning Dhoni's decisions and Dhoni might not have an answer right now
 saal 2008 main under 19 team ko world champion banane vaale captain kohli badi lig main khilne aae, tab bhi unke tevar barkaraar are
 diggajon ne unhen pahchaanane main der nahin kii ki viraat kohli team india kii kaman lambey samay tak sambhaal sakate hai
 Virat Kohli scored 235 runs at an average of 47 in 6 matches, the highest for his team in the Under-19 World Cup 6 years ago, after Tanmay Srivastava
 bataur khilaadi kohli kii kaabiliyat par koi sawaal nahin or bataur captain to unka pradasharn or nikharata rahaa he
 He averaged 66 in 8 odis played as a captain so far
 4 rahaa he, is dauraan unhone do shatak lagaae, jabaki 130 vanade maichon main viraat kaa ausat 51
 There have been 85 and there have been 18 century innings to his name
 videshi jameen par team india kii lagaataar haar se team india par kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 Virat Kohli has got a chance to captain every time on foreign soil
 ab tak mili 8 maukon main viraat kohli ne 7 baar apni team or phans ko maayoos nahin hone diya he
 Whether or not Virat Kohli is able to carry on Dhoni's tradition, the phase of the ordeal has already started and the fans are also waiting to know Kohli's answer

 India's stylish batsman Ambati Rayudu, who owns superb technology and amazing temperament, is celebrating his 29th birthday today
 raidu bharat ke un khilaadiyon main hai jinako pratibha hone ke baavjood bhi bahut zyada limlite nahin mila
 Rayudu got a chance to make his debut against Zimbabwe on 24 July 2013 after being cooked in a domestic cricket furnace for nearly 11 years
 raidu ko unke shuruaati dinon se hi aglaa sachin tendulkar kaha jane laga tha
 Seeing his amazing talent, he was made the captain of the Indian team in the 2004 Under-19 World Cup and under his captaincy, India went to the semi-finals
 2002 main raidu ne apane pehle hi ranjai sijan main dhamaakedaar pradarshan kar sansani failaa di
 Playing for Hyderabad, he created a furore in Indian cricket by scoring a double century in the first innings and a century in the second innings of the same match
 haalanki ise kismat nahin to or kya kaha jaae ki raidu kii captaini main khilne vaale irfan pathan, suresh raina or dinesh karthik ko unase pehle bharat ke liye khilne kaa mauka mil gaya
 Rayudu was banned by the BCCI for playing in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), which started in 2007
 jiske chalate vah gharelu cricket ke dhaanche se dur ho gaye
 However, in 2009, Rayudu broke into his agreement with ICL and joined the bcci-run framework
 apane jivan main ek ke baad ek utaar chadhaav dekhne vaale raidu bharat ke un gine chune khilaadiyon main shumaar hai, jo team ke liye kisi bhi number par batting kar sakate hai
 If Rayudu gets as many opportunities as some of the players of India have got, then surely his name will also be in the list of big players of India

 This incident shook him
 vah khud ko ek laachaar bhai samajhane lage jo apni bahan kaa ilaaj bhi nahin karvaa paaya
 After the sister left the world, Saidul had decided that due to lack of money in his village, no one will be denied treatment
 jaisaa unke parivaar ke saath hua he vaisaa gaanv ke kisi bhi ghar main nahin hoga
 Anita, who had climbed Mount Everest twice, now started climbing here and started making history, the task of making the hospital was done

 The girl caught Saidul 100 and took her number

 When the team of the film gathered in Mumbai to release the trailer of the film 'fantastic', then there was a great chemistry between them
 maahaul hansi majaak se bharaa tha or har koi film ke hero shahid kapur ke saport main khadaa tha
 It is obvious that when Shahid Kapoor will come in front of the media after marriage, he will be asked questions of marriage
 aisa hi yahaan bhi hua, magar unase zyada jawaab kabhi unki heroin aalia bhatta de rahi thim to kabhi unke nirmaataa karan johar
 The comments jab media ne shahid se unki shaadi ke bare main ek sawaal poocha tab aalia jhat se kud padin or kaha ki shahid kii shandaar shaadi ho chuki he
 After that, when Shahid was asked what was the best gift in marriage, Alia came to the ground to answer and said that she received the gift in Shahid's wedding was 'fabulous'
 aalia kaa ye jawaab sunate hi karan johar ne bhi majaak-majaak main jawaab de diya or kaha ki hamane shahid kii shaadi main aalia ko pack karke bheja tha tohfe ke taur par
 Apparently, this chemistry, which is seen during the promotion of the film 'fantastic', is expected to see some similar chemistry in the film as well
 jaahir he ki shaadi ke baad jab shahid kapur media ke saamne aaenge to unase shaadi ke sawaal puche hi jaaenge
 The same happened here, but more than ever, his heroine Alia Bhatt was giving more answers than him and sometimes his producer Karan Johar
 tippaniyan When the media asked Shahid a question about his marriage, Alia quickly jumped in and said that Shahid has had a wonderful marriage
 uske baad jab shahid se sawaal poocha gaya ki shaadi main sabase acha tohfa kya mila tab bhi jawaab dene aalia hi maidan main utrin or kaha ki shahid kii shaadi main unhen tohfa mila 'shandaar'
 On hearing this reply of Alia, Karan Johar also jokingly replied and said that we had packed Alia in Shahid's wedding as a gift
 jaahir he ye chemistry jo film 'shandaar' ke prachaar ke samay najar aa rahi he, kuch aisi hi chemistry ko film main bhi dekhe jane kii ummid he

 The Home Ministry is not satisfied that the CBI has evidence to arrest or prosecute a top Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer in the Ishrat Jahan encounter case
 nau varsh puraani farji muthbhed kii is ghatana main gujarat main ishrat ke alaava teen or logon kii bhi maut hui thi
 a senior home ministry official said that the investigating agency has shared its evidence against IB Special Director Rajindra Kumar with him and has expressed his intention to arrest him in this infamous case
 adhikari ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòsibiai (kendriya jaanch beuro) ne grahamantralay ke saath sakshya saajha kiya he, jiske baad mantralay ne sibiai se kaha ki yah sakshya nahin darshata ki kumaar muthbhed kii sajeesh kaa hissaa the
 There is not enough evidence against the senior IPS officer
 grahamantralay ne spasht kiya ki kumaar ke khilaaf itane sakshya nahin hai ki sibiai ko kathith farji muthbhed maamle main kumaar ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati di ja sake
 The CBI, however, has not sought permission from the Home Ministry to prosecute Kumar, who is the cadre controller of IPS officers
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki sibiai grih mantralay se mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati maange bagaiyr kumaar ko 31 july ko unke sevanivrutt hone ke baad giraftaar karne or unpar mukadmaa chalaane kii yojana bana rahi he
 Meanwhile, CBI sources said that he does not need permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs to prosecute Kumar as the case is about an alleged fake encounter, which is not part of the duty of a government official
 sibiai sutron ne kaha ki kathith farji muthbhed ke kuch maamalon main, jo punjab main hue or jinaki jaanch sibiai ne kii, mukademe ke liye anumati kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi
 CBI sources said that in some cases of alleged fake encounters, which took place in Punjab and were investigated by the CBI, permission was not required for the trial
 pichley pakhwaade sibiai ne ibi ke varisht adhikari se poochtacha kii thi taaki us kathith farji muthbhed kii sajeesh main unki bhoomika kaa pataa lag sake, jisamen ishrat or teen anya log maare gaye the
 CBI sources say that there is evidence that Kumar is one of the officers who interrogated Ishrat when she was allegedly kept in illegal custody by the Gujarat Police
 tippaniyan Sources said that the officer had a long questioning over Ishrat's alleged interrogation and other information
 unhone bataaya ki poochtacha ke dauraan kumaar aspasht the or lagaataar kah rahe the ki unhen ghatana se jude kai bindu yaad nahin hai kyonki ghatana nau saal pehle hui thi
 Sources said Kumar, a 1979 batch manipur-tripura cadre IPS officer, had allegedly given intelligence that a group of lashkar-e-taiba militants were coming to Ahmedabad to target Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 grahamantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki jaanch agency ne ibi ke vishesh nideshak rajindra kumaar ke khilaaf apana sakshya uske saath saajha kiya he or is kukhyat maamle main use giraftaar karne kaa iraadaa jaahir kiya he
 "the CBI (central Bureau of Investigation) has shared evidence with the Ministry of Home Affairs, after which the ministry told the CBI that this evidence does not indicate that Kumar was part of the plot of the encounter," the official said
 varisht ipies adhikari ke khilaaf paryaapt sakshya nahin hai
 The Home Ministry clarified that there is not enough evidence against Kumar to allow the CBI to prosecute Kumar in the alleged fake encounter case
 sibiai ne haalanki grahamantralay se kumaar par mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati nahin maangi he, jo ipies adhikariyon kaa cader niyantrak he

 In August, Uma Bharti, the Union Minister for Water Resources, River Development and the new life of Ganga, told the Lok Sabha that his government intends to explore the river with all seriousness
 unke mantralay ne kendriya bhoojal board ko elahabaad ke ek kile ke bheetar maujuud kuen kaa pani jaanchane ke aadesh die hai taaki lupt ho chuki nadi kaa strot or uskaa rasta talasha ja sake
 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the Ministry of Culture seem to have responded positively to the renewed interest in the project
 ucch padasth sutron ne india today ko pushti kii ki november se ees ghagghar-hakaraa nadi maarg par kuch pramukh sthalon kii khudaai karegaa
 It is believed that Saraswati river may have been this way
 ghagghar nadi himachal pradesh se nikalati he or punjab tathaa haryana se hote hue rajasthan tak jaati he
 Hakra comes from Pakistan and is considered an extension of Ghaggar in India
 ees kii yojana is maheene ke ant main ghagghar-hakaraa nadi maarg ke shuruaati hisson main pracheen rihaaishon kii pahchaan karnaa he taaki nae sire se khudaai kii shuruyaat kii ja sake
 The initial sites of these will be in Rajasthan or Haryana
 india today ko ek ucch padasth sutara ne naam jaahir na karne kii shart par bataaya, ‚Äúhamaara uddeshy simit he
 ASI cannot work on revival projects, so we will work on excavation and exploration of sites around the ghaggar-hakra river route
 isse us daur ke logon kii vaastukala, niyojan or jeevanstyli kaa akalan kiya ja sake
 We hope to start digging from next month
 ‚Äù is tarah kii khudaai nadi ghati sabhyataa kii khoj main khaasi mahatvapurn sabit ho sakati he
 This time the ASI is very cautious, taking the rules along and there are good reasons for this
 2006 main sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri kii adhyakshata vaale ek sansadeey panel ne is prakriya kii khaamiyon or endie ke shuru kiye gaye saraswati viraasat project ke vaigyanik aadhaar par sawaal uthaaya tha
 It pulled up the ASI and asked how the institute could take up the project of restoration and exploration of a river when no institute has approved such a study, which is a basic condition
 sarkaar badalane ke saath is baar ees ke paas kai prastaav aae hai jiname ghagghar-hakaraa nadi maarg par khudaai kaa prastaav he
 Among those who have made such a recommendation are ASI, the Investigation Branch of Delhi and Deccan College, Pune, among others
 ees is baar phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakh rahi he kyonki pichley saal uttar pradesh ke dondia kheda main khajaane kii talash ke liye khudaai karke ek baar usne apane haath jala liye hai
 This excavation was done on the basis of the dream of a saint named Shobhan Sarkar
 isiilie is baar ees ko is khudaai ke liye central adwijuri board of archi yology (siab) kii anumati kaa intjaar he
 The CABA is the apex body of the ASI which considers the archaeological features of an excavation project before it is cleared

 Archaeologist and Additional Director General of ASI b

 Mani defended the move, stating that the institution had never actually stopped exploration and research work at the ancient Harappan sites, namely the ghaggar-hakra sites, which were initiated as part of the Saraswati project of the NDA regime
 rajasthan ke hanumangarh jile kaa hadappa kaaleen kalibanga shahar bilkul ghagghar nadi main hi basaa tha
 It has been excavated long ago and there is also a museum of ASI
 unhone india today ko mail se bataaya, ‚Äúees or duusari vidwaan sansthaaen haryana, rajasthan, punjab or gujarat main kaam kar rahi hai or unhone kai ahm sthalon tathaa puratathvik saamagree kii khoj kii he
 The description of new material found at sites like Bhirana of Haryana dates back to the eighth century BCE of Indian civilization
 ees or anya sansthaaen is kshetra main nae sthalon par khudaai kaa kaam karengi or is par siab kii sthaayee samiti kii baithak ke baad jald hi faisla hoga
 ‚Äùmani has directed over 14 exploration projects including Lal Kot (delhi), Salimgarh (delhi), Muhammad Nagar and Harnol (haryana), Siswania, Sankisa, Ayodhya, Lathia (UP) and Kanispur and Ambaran (jammu and Kashmir ) Are included
 unhone ‚Äòsindhu-saraswati‚Äô sabhyataa par bhi kaaphi maatra main likhaa he
 In one of his recent writings, in the eighth century BCE in the 'lost' river valley, Mani writes about the 'lost' Saraswati / Hakra valley and establishes Haryana and Rajasthan as centers of pre-harappan culture
 mani likhte hai, ‚Äúcholistaan main hakaraa nadi ghati ‚Äòlupt‚Äô saraswati ghati kaa hi vistaar he
 Excavations here have found such earthenware called 'hakra ware'
 isse is baat kii pushti hoti he ki ‚Äòlupt‚Äô saraswati nadi kii ghati main mila saanskrithik str bhartiya sabhyataa kaa paalna he
 ‚Äùhe claims that the radiometric dates obtained at Bhirana, Rakhigarhi and Kalibanga clearly indicate what were the stages of development of Harappan culture in this subcontinent
 yah saraswati nadi kaa punaruddhar ke abhiyaan ke bilkul upyukt baithta he, jise na sirf nadi balki ek sabhyataa ke taur par dekha jayega
 In the flow of time, Saraswatijagmohan Malhotra announced at the Saraswati River Research Institute in Yamunanagar, Haryana in June 2002 that the center would carry out excavation along the lost Saraswati river route
 iske liye chaar sadasyon kii ek cameti gathit kii gai or do charan main khudaai kii yojana bani
 In the first phase, there was a plan for Bhagwanpura of Sirsa via Kurukshetra from Adi Badri of Yamunanagar
 duusare main khudaai rajasthan ke kalibanga tak kii jaani thi
 During this period, a study was carried out in 2004 by the scientists of the Regional Remote Sensing Service Center in Jodhpur, ISRO and the Ground Water Department of the Government of Rajasthan

 Till then, partial excavations had been done in ten of these, including Adi Badri, Thanesar, Sandhauli, Bhirana and Hansi in Haryana, Baror, Tarkhanwala Dera and Chak 86 in Rajasthan and Dhaulavira and Junikaran in Gujarat

 bisht us vakt ees ke upmahanideshak the or unhone hi mote taur par saraswati project kii kaman sanbhali thi
 This was followed by the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and the whole scenario changed
 jaisaa ki bisht kehete hai, ‚Äúbadakismati se nai sarkaar ne badi chaalaaki se project ko thande baste main daal diya
 Even after retiring, Bisht was given a six-month extension of service by the NDA government so that he could take the project forward
 sarkaar badalane par unhone kaam band kar diya
 Now a decade later, the trend of political winds has changed again
 mana ja rahaa he ki ees ne saraswati kii talash main khode jane vaale sthalon ke bare main chupchaap unase suzav maanga he
 He says, "the project was killed before it started and only because the new government came
 ise bhagavakaran ke prayaas ke taur par dekha gaya
 In fact, it was a multifaceted project to understand how such residences emerged together
 ‚Äùunke daavon kii aitihaasik sateekta ke bare main or kathith saraswati nadi ke ghagghar-hakaraa naditantr ke saath ekarupata ko lekar kai log sawaal karte hai
 Another archaeologist associated with ASI, on the condition of anonymity, says that the ghaggar-hakra river system and the civilizations around it may have no connection with the river mentioned in the Vedas
 unhone bataaya, ‚Äúmere vichaar se ghagghar-hakaraa kaa saraswati se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The entire stay from Kalibanga to Rakhigarhi is clearly part of the ancient trade route
 saraswati kii talash to yahaan angrejon ke jamaane se hi ho rahi he or dhire-dhire yah maamla rajnatik ho chukaa he
 The fact is that no archaeological evidence exists to show the path of Saraswati's flow ‚Äî not even to show that there was a river named Saraswati
 ‚Äùdilli vishvavidhyalay main itihaas kii professor or puratatvavid nayanjot lahidi duusari baat kahati hai
 She says that going beyond Saraswati's whims is more important
 unke shabdon main, ‚Äúakele saraswati kii jagah centre or samskruti mantralay ko puraatatv ke liye ek vyapak rashtriya drushti ko prastut karnaa chahie jo samooche desh ko cover karti ho
 "it is also not to be forgotten here that IIT Kanpur discovered a large water source deep in the river valley last year

 mukhyamantri ne afasaron kii posting or tabadale ko mudda banaate hue grih mantralay kii adhisuchana ko taanaashaahee bataaya
 Inaugurating the meeting, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government has worked hard and worked very hard in the last 100 days

 The CM said that his government is currently focusing on 11 major issues - pollution, electricity, traffic, corruption, water, education, slum, women safety, traffic, irregular colonies and health

 He said, "the Delhi High Court order is a major victory for the people of the national capital, clarifying that the Union Home Ministry has no right to interfere in the Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) cases
" 'kejariwal ne kaha, 'main aapkohai courtke faisle kii badhai dena chahta hum
 The anti-corruption Bureau came into force in Delhi 40 years ago
 40 saal pehle iskaa adhikaar kshetra dilli aadhaarit sabhi agenciyon par tha, chaahe wo centre sarkaar kii ho, didie ho, police ho, emsidi ho
 The ACB could investigate the corruption case of all these bodies
 'mukhyamantri ne kaha ki beete saal unki 49 dinon kii sarkaar ke samay is desh ke ek bade aadmi mukesh ambani ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 After his government went, the Center issued a directive limiting the scope of the ACB to only Delhi government officials
 unhone kaha, 'isamen kaha gaya he ki asibi centre sarkaar ke adhikariyon, police or endiemasi ke bhrashtachar ko nahin dekhegi
 But the High Court has ordered that the Center and the Ministry of Home Affairs have no right to interfere in ACB cases
 'purna rajya ke mudde par palat gai bijepicendre or dilli sarkaar main takaraav ke bich aam aadmi party ne purna rajya ke darje ko lekar centre par nayaa hamalaa bolaa
 In the open cabinet on Monday, Kejriwal said that since 1992 the BJP had been emphasizing on this issue, but now it has completely reversed
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav or 2014 ke aam chunaav ke ghoshnaptr main dilli ko purna rajya dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin maujuuda sarkaar kii ore se koi faisla nahin kiya gaya

 After the Chief Minister's address in the Open Cabinet, all the ministers in turn presented the details of 100 days work of their ministry to the public
 is dauraan janata ko sawaal poochne kaa bhi mauka diya gaya

 All the three distribution companies of Delhi have sent their petition to increase the price to the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC)
 diiarsi maan jaaegi to 10-15 fisadi badhotaree sambhavabijli companiyon ne apane hisaab-kitaab main dikhaaya he ki pichley saal unhen kamai ke mukaable lagbhag 2200 karod zyada kharch karne pade hai
 Once again, two companies of BSES and Tata Power Distribution Limited have said that to reduce their losses, a hike in electricity prices will be necessary
 haalanki companiyon ne sidhe taur apni yachika main yah nahin bataaya he ki unhen kitni badhotaree chahie
 According to experts, if the DERC assumes a loss of 2200 crores, then it is possible to increase by 10 to 15 percent
 teenon companiyon ne dikhaaya karodon kaa nuksaandrasal yachika teenon companiyon ne alag-alag saunpi he
 According to sources, BSES Rajdhani, a power distribution company in south and west Delhi, has shown a loss of about 900 crores in its petition in the last financial year
 vahiin purvi or central dilli main vitaran karne vaali company bisies yamuna ne bhi 600 karod kaa nuksaan bataaya he
 According to the information, TPDDL, the Tata company handling distribution in North Delhi, has said in its petition about the loss of about 700 crores

 After this year, Aam Aadmi Party government appointed Krishna Saini as the head of the new DERC
 ab bhi dilli vidyut vinimayak ayog ke teen sadasyon main se ek jagah khaali hi padi he
 Therefore, the companies have submitted the petition, but whether this petition will be approved amid the politics of electricity in Delhi, it seems difficult at the moment

 Sushil Modi said that very soon a delegation of BJP will meet the Governor and submit a memorandum to them so that they can review the law and order situation in the state even from their level

 In the latest statement, Shatrughan Sinha said that there is no way to assess the performance of a government in a short period of time
 unhone kaha ki itane kam samay main kisi sarkaar ke kaam ko nahin aanka ja saktaa
 Said, 'even the honeymoon period of the new Bihar government is not over yet
 'safal nahin hoti nakaaratmak raajnneetibihar vidhansabha chunaavon ke prachaar abhiyaan se khud ko dur rakhane vaale sinha ne sawaal daaga ki dilli or maharashtra main kya ho rahaa he? dilli main kanoon-vyavastha centre sarkaar ke jimme he, jabaki maharashtra main bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar he

 He was not surprised
 jo bachche pehle apane sahpaathiyon se kuch bhi saz karne ke liye skool kii canteen main daud padate the, ve ab aisi baaten failaane ke liye apane mobile par tut padate hai
 According to a survey conducted in 2014 by Tata Consultancy Services, 71 percent people said that mobile is their most favorite gadget
 yah survey 12 shaharon ke 12,300 chaatro ke bich kiya gaya
 An example of this is that in May this year, a student of class XII of Gurgaon committed suicide because she was scolded by the teacher for sending messages from mobile while sitting in class
 june, 2013 main 16 saal kii ek chaatra mumbai main local se gir gai kyonki vah mobile par baat karne main magn thi

 Then gradually it becomes such a craze that six to seven hours a day go into it

 yah lat aapako is dar se lagati he ki aapke saath kahin kuch bahut ahm hone vaala he or kahin aisa hote vakt aap pahunch se baahar na rah jaaen, us par pratikriya dene se na rah jaaen
 Needless to say that this fear is exaggerated
 mobile phone kii niztaa kii aad main kai kism kii vyavahaargat samasyaayein paidaa ho jaati hai
 Take, for example, a 35-year-old woman from Bangalore

 She was breaking out of loneliness and boredom

 phir use aadat padati gai
 She would explain to herself that the game would be played for a few hours, but the night passed while playing the game
 vah kahati he, ''jab aap aisi sthiti main hote hai, tab saaf soch nahin pate

 darasal saria ke esadipio deepak kumaar sharma ko gupt soochna mili thi ki jiti road par barhi ke raste teen container main pashuon ko bharkar avaidh tareeke se kolkata le jaaya ja rahaa he
 On the information, the SDPO formed a team under the leadership of Bagodar police station in-charge Rajiv Kumar and posted on GT Road
 jaanch ke dauraan teen container ko jab rokane ke liye ishaara kiya gaya, to pashu taskaron ne police party ko raundne kii koshish kii or gaadiyaan le kar bhaagane lage
 The police stopped all the three vehicles by overtaking and arrested seven people, including the driver and the Khalasi of the three trains
 jab police ne container kaa darwaja khulwaaya to bheetar kaa manjar dekhakar awak rah gai
 108 animals were crammed into all three containers

 The postal parcel is behind two containers and clean Yogi Raj is written on the back of one container
 saath hi teenon contenron main se kisi main bhi number plate nahin he
 It can be understood that how the tactics are being adopted for the smuggling of animals

 During interrogation of the arrested animal smugglers, the names of many more people involved in this racket are set to be revealed

 Also, there is no number plate in any of the three containers

 '' The foundation of Bigg Boss rests on the fate of the housemates, on the controversy
 kya kijiega yahi is sho kii khaasiyat jo he
 But to enter this house, can anyone bet on the dignity and dignity of a senior IPS outside the house just to give rise to controversy and for its own publicity? You would not have seen, which was composed by the vicious mind of a model and a lawyer and who shook the entire Mumbai Police
 sirf big bos ke ghar main entry paane ke liye ek model kis had tak ja sakati he? media ko istemaal kar kisi ko badnaam karne ke liye wo kya kuch kar sakati he? aap sunenge to dang rah jaaenge
 Thinking of shame, can anyone use the Nirbhaya of December 16, which the whole country cried, to get publicity only and only? Yes, she is the model of Mayanagari, who has taken over the Mumbai Police DIG Sunil Parskar was charged with rape
 tivi reality sho big bos main apni entry pakki karne ke liye model ne vakil ke saath milakar diaiji par rape kaa sansanikhez ilzaam laga diya
 Now the question is, what is the serious matter like rape related to reality show Bigg Boss? After all, how can a Bigg Boss ticket be confirmed by accusing someone of raping like this? And the most important thing is that how can anyone just put such a serious charge on someone to get entry in Bigg Boss? Is any model just trying to sneak into Bigg Boss house to unnecessarily confront such a big officer of Mumbai Police In fact, this model met her lawyer Rizwan Siddiqui in her chamber
 iske baad jo bhi baatcheet hoti he wo sab record ho jaati he
 This audio and CCTV video of the conversation is not released by anyone but the model's lawyer himself
 haalanki is vakil ko model ne ab badal diya he
 Now let us see with our own eyes and hear with your ears what is the truth of the model's rape? Model - Think how we can trap someone
 movie main kaise hota he
 Prepare the same plot
 vakil-tumhen hilaanaa he naa?model-haa, tum dhundho
 Lawyer - i find myself
 edwocket rigwaan ke saath model kii ye baatcheet un shuruaati dinon kii he, jab shaayad ye model apane vakil se kisi aise shikaar ko fansane ke liye kah rahi thi
 That's why he said do something like what happens in films
 lekin donon ke bich hui agali baatcheet ke video se ye saafe he ki tab tak diaiji sunil parskar is model kii radar main aa chuke the
 Model - i want to publicize her bad
 vakil-wo mere par chhod do
 model-i Really Vanna Harees himvakil-woh Mere Paon Mein model-not Harement
 
 He has to do bad publicity
 usko pareshaan nahin karnaa he
 Let the news go for 2-3 days
 dats aal aai waant
 His image has to be spoiled and nothing else
 vaise khud vakil sahab kii ore se jari is video par yakeen karen, to yahaan tak to parskar ko badnaam karne ke liye khud vakil sahab bhi taiyaar nazar aate hai
 Now the matter starts with notice and then gradually ends by going on the case and getting the punishment
 baatcheet main vakil lagaataar mashware detaa he
 Whether to file a complaint with the lawyer-human Site Commission
 model-abhi jo notice de rahe havekil-wo to use nanga karne ke liye or tumhaari publicity ke liewakil-dekho isamen kya banegaa
 It will have two or three things
 ek to wo badnaam ho jaayegaa
 Okay
 
 Poonam does this through Pandey
 yah ham apratyaksh daal denge
 You have to attack Poonam Pandey and not through him
 model-haa, iske thru hi hoga navakil-iske thru ja ke kar sakati ho
 
 doosraa isape vibhageeya jaanch bitha sakate he
 Let the model be his dirty publicity
 meri kuch acchhee publicity bana lenaa
 Let it be a little dirty too
 had to ye he ki is publicity ke liye khud ye model bhi apni faziihat karwaane ko taiyaar he
 For this, what she says is overly embarrassing and regrettable
 kyonki is baatcheet main media se lekar wo 16 disambar kii nirbhaya tak ke istemaal kii baat karti he
 Model: You think that if we give Rakesh Mariya's through pressure, then something will happen
 jo ham bataate jaye uski jaanch kare
 Lawyer-no-model-won't? Lawyer-won't do anything
 
 The media will keep on playing
 kuch nahin karege
 
 wo dilli kaa cese maaloom he
 That gang-rape model - that nerbhaya ka kesavakil - was that big case
 model-us level par lekar gaye to?vakil-wo bada tha
 The biggest minus point is that the public will feel that you are doing this for publicity
 punam
 Of Pandey folovers bolenge kii tumne publicity ke liye kiya he
 It will be slightly negative impact
 haalanki apane muvakkil kii ye baatcheet jari karne ke baad ab vakil sahab ye kah rahe hai ki unhen tab unki client ne ye nahin bataaya tha ki wo kisi ofisar par rape kaa maamla darj karwaane ja rahi he
 However, what is the whole truth of the matter
 ye to khayr ek mukammal tafteesh ke baad hi saafe ho sakegaa, lekin kahani abhi khatm nahin hui he

 purv rajanyik or mantri natwar singh ne hedlins today channel ke saath baatcheet main kai khulaase kiye
 Some of these were known to almost all of them and some were even known for the first time
 inamen sabase bada khulaasa yah tha ki rahul gandhi ne apni maa se kaha tha kiwah pradhanmantri naa bane
 He said that his grandmother and father sitting on this post were brutally murdered and he did not want to lose his mother
 unki is zid ke kaaran sonia gandhi ne piem bananaa nahin sweekaar kiya or manmohan singh kaa chunaav hua
 Similarly, his disclosure that Sonia Gandhi wanted to make Shankar Dayal Sharma the Prime Minister in 1991 and not Narasimha Rao is shocking
 natwar singh un netaaon main rahe jinka party main bahut mahatv tha or jo sonia ke mutthi bhar kareebi logon main rahe
 There is no reason to point fingers at his revelations
 aakhir sonia gandhi pradhanmantri nahin baniin to uski koi vajah to jarur thi
 There is no reason to believe that he did this for mere sacrifice
 yah maanane kii bhi koi vajah nahin he ki natwar singh ke saath sonia or congress ne jo durvyavhaar kiya, us kaaran unhone ye baaten likhin or kahin
 There may be some exaggeration in the words of Natwar Singh, but he is not far from the truth
 unki is baat kii ki sonia gandhi kii pahunch har jaruri file tak thi, pehle hi tasdik ho chuki he
 Dr
 Sanjay Baru, who was an advisor to Manmohan Singh, had made it clear that through Pulok Chatterjee, all the files were sent to Sonia Gandhi
 baharhaal sawaal yah nahin he ki natwar singh sach bol rahe hai yaa nahin
 The question is, if Natwar Singh is misinforming, what is the truth? Sonia Gandhi is deferring the matter by saying that she too will write a book
 lekin kitaab jab likhi jaaegi tab kya hoga, iskaa abhi se kayaas lagaana nirarthak he
 At the moment, talk should be made about the revelations that Natwar Singh has made
 agar natwar singh ko sonia gandhipar daag lagaana hi tha to ve un par gambhir aarope laga sakate the lekin unhone aisa karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 The Congress has been in power for almost six decades and many big scams and mistakes occurred during that time, Natwar Singh would have disclosed many of them if he wanted
 lekin apnesajjan or vivekpurna swabhaav ke kaaran unhone aisa karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 The truth is seen in the things that came out of this interview of Natwar Singh
 sonia gandhi ko is par itani pratikriya dene kii jarurat nahin thi

 rajdhani dilli main lagaataar bad rahi pradooshan kii samasya ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 Every year Delhi goes through the brunt of pollution, but the problem still remains

 According to doctors, only masks like N95 and N99 are effective in such pollution
 agar mask nahin kharid sakate hai to makhmal ke kapade ko teen layer main mask ke taur par istemaal kiya jaae tab bhi 70 se 80 pratishat pradooshan se bachaav kiya ja saktaa hai

 Naming of Pakistan is part of the recent headlines, but amidst all this, Nawaz Sharif, far away from JNU, has confessed that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was stabbed on the back
 tippaniyan Kargil was executed just after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee went on a bus trip to Lahore
 itane saalon ke baad ye baat nawaz shareef khud kah rahe hai, isse ek baar phir pakistan main chuni hui sarkaron kii kamajori saamne aati he, kyonki sabko yaad he ki kargil ko pakistan kii sena ne anjaam diya tha
 It also explains the attitude of Pakistan that a part of it never accepts the path of peace and friendship for India
 jabaki ek hissaa jisamen vahaan kii sarkarein or political mukhiya bhi shaamil hai, ye koshish salonsaal karata rahaa he
 In recent times, Narendra Modi had reached Nawaz Sharif's family event, so that no one can mind but at the same time it is also important not to forget the attitude of that part of Pakistan which goes from Kargil to 26 / 11, And may be behind Pathankot from 26 / 11
 jab pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi lahore kii bas yatra par gaye the, thik uske baad hi kargil ko anjaam diya gaya
 Nawaz Sharif himself is saying this after so many years, this again reveals the weakness of the elected governments in Pakistan, because everyone remembers that Kargil was executed by the Pakistan Army
 ye pakistan ke ravaiye ko bhi bataata he ki uskaa ek hissaa kabhi bhi bharat ke liye aman or dosti kaa rasta nahin maanata
 Whereas a part which includes the governments and political heads there has been trying for years
 haal hi ke dinon main nawaz shareef ke paariwarik kaarykram main narendra modi pahunche the, jisase kisi ko aitraaj nahin ho saktaa he lekin saath hi ye bhi jaruri he ki pakistan ke us hisse ke ravaiye ko bhi naa bhoolen jo kargil se lekar 26 / 11, or 26 / 11 se lekar pathankot ke peeche ho saktaa he
