tej growth se jahaan aam aadmi ke liye achche din aaengen vahiin achche monsoon se tej aarthik growth tay ho jayega
 So a good monsoon is very important for good days and the last 3 years of rainfall figures show that the monsoon is constantly helping the Modi government
 beete teen saal main rigerv bank ne 4-5 baar byaaj daron main katautee kii lekin phir bhi achche din nahin dekhne ko mili
 At the same time, during the first two years of the Modi government, less than expected rain and drought conditions in many parts of the country did not let the good days come close
 aise main kya ab mausam vibhaag kaa ausat se adhik barish kaa anumaan desh ko achche dinon main le jayega
 Now does the monsoon's sentiment on the economy become so heavy that economic data starts falling when it is weak and everything starts to get better as soon as the average rainfall is indicated
 aakhir achche monsoon kii ummid kahaan-kahaan asar dikhaane lagati he
 The stock market, running on the expectation of monsoon, recently released estimates that the current year will be good in terms of monsoon
 or desh ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main ausat se adhik barish dekhne ko milegi
 This news gave the stock market and energy in the last few months and it was successful in crossing the magic figure of first thirty thousand and after the recent report of Meteorological Department, it crossed the magical level of 31 thousand
 darasal acchhee barish or natijatan acchhee fasal kii ummid par auto, infrastracchar or bankig sector ke sheyaron kii jamkar kharidari shuru ho jaati he
 It is worth noting that the monsoon is knocking in the country from June 1 and on the normal pace, the whole country is hit by monsoon in the next 15 days
 is baar monsoon ne kerala ke tateey ilaakon par 30 june ko dastak dekar mausam vibhaag ke achche monsoon kii bhavishyavaanee par muhar laga di he
 Bumper preparations for kharif sowing: Kharif sowing starts simultaneously with the monsoon in the country
 mausam vibhaag ke is anumaan se desh main kharif buaai kaa intjaar kar rahe kisaanon ke liye badi raahat ai he
 For the past two consecutive years, the weak monsoon has given them nothing but desperation
 ab ausat se behatar barish unki ummiido ko badha rahaa he ki vah kharif sijan main acchhee paidaavaar karke beete do saal ke apane nuksaan kii bharpai kar paaenge
 It seems that inflation is benefiting from better than average rains in the country
 desh main khaadya saamagree kii keemten kaabo main rahati he
 By buying cheap food grains, people get enough money for other necessary purchases
 lihaaja is khabar se kisaanon ke chahare par abhi se chamak dikhni shuru ho jaati he or acchhee aamadani kii ummid par vah apni puri takat kharif buaai main laga dete hai
 The loan will be cheaper Recently, the Reserve Bank, while reviewing its monetary policy, said that the possibility of cutting interest rates on the onset of better monsoon will increase
 aise main mausam vibhaag kii maane aane vaale kuch mahine byaaj daron par rigerv bank ke faisle ke liye ahm sabit honge
 Significantly, experts believe that further reduction in interest rates is the key to accelerating the economy
 rigerv bank ke is kadam se desh main karj sasta hoga or kaarobaari ke saath-saath aam aadmi bainkon se zyada se zyada karj uthaane kii koshish karenge
 Auto sector hopes of good sales, good crop and business boom have a direct impact on common man's savings
 ek taraf jahaan uski kamai badhati hai vahiin khaane-pine kii jaruri vastuon kii mahangaai niyantrit rahane se uski sevings main bhi ijapha dikhne kii ummid bad jaati he
 According to experts, this is the most important time for the auto sector in any country when the common man insists on the purchase of tractors used in farming including two wheelers, four wheelers, commercial motors
 achche monsoon se in companiyon par pichley kuch samay se chai mandi talane kii ummid he
 Now political opinion has been raised on the opinion poll
 congress or uske kai sahyogi dalon ne opinian pole ko ‘gorakhdhandha’, ‘tamaasha’ or ‘managasaint’ qaraar dete hue is par bain lagane kii joardaar vakaalat kii he
 At the same time, BJP has said that doing so is neither constitutionally acceptable nor necessary, as it is a part of freedom of expression
 keval bijepi hi nahin, unke sahyogi rahi mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party ne bhi opinian pole par pratibandh lagane kii maang kii he
 The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is also in favor of Bain
 basapa ke alaava sapa netaa ajam khan ne bhi kaha he, 'ham yah nahin kehete ki media galat he, lekin opinian pole kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Although National Conference MP Mehboob Baig said that they cannot be banned, but many of the polls are wrong
 bijepi ne kaha ki congress isliye iskaa virodh kar rahi he, kyonki vah narendra modi se dari hui he, kyonki in surveykshanon main vipakshi dal ko badhat milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 It is worth noting that almost all opinion polls that have been happening for some time are showing an edge to the BJP, especially in favor of Modi
 haalanki congress ne is kaha he ki ve modi se bhaybheet nahin hai
 The public statements of Congress leaders regarding banning election surveys have come at a time when a few days ago Congress wrote a letter to the Election Commission, demanding a ban on the publication and dissemination of such surveys during elections
 congress ne kaha he ki is tarah ke surveykshan ‘trutipurna’, ‘gairbharosemand’ tathaa ‘managasaint’ hote hai
 Digvijay Singh said- joke has become party general secretary Digvijay Singh said, 'it has become a joke
 usapar puri tarah pratibandh lagaana chahie
 The kind of complaints and information received suggests that anyone can pay for the survey as per their wish
 sava arab logon vaale desh main kaise kuch hajaar log rujhaan kaa anumaan laga sakate hai? yah gorakhdhandha ban gaya he
 Many such groups have appeared
 bataa den ki philhal matdaan ke 48 ghante pehle se opinian pole par pratibandh he
 Opinion polls are concocted many times: Rajiv Shukla, Union Minister and senior Congress leader Rajiv Shukla said separately that Opinion Polls are concocted many times, so the party has done well by opposing it
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi asli opinian pole hon to kisi ko dikkat nahin he lekin ab hamen jis tarah kii khabaren mil rahi he, usase pataa chalata he ki ve managasaint hote hai
 Everyone is coming out with opinion poll
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘nishchit hi, jab media publicity karne lagata he, log usase prabhavit hote hai
 Therefore, it has been the right demand of the party
 pole se pehle tatasth dimag hona chahie
 bjp's Arun Jaitley said, why the ban, while opposing the demand for ban on rape, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that the election analysis in India is still maturing and some opinion polls may be wrong but This does not mean that they should be banned
 jetali ne bijepi kii ore se jari ek aalekh main kaha, ‘opinian pole ho rahe hai
 Some have gained credibility while some can be easily ignored
 in pole kii vishwasaneeyata ho yaa nahin, kya inhen pratibandhit kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that political parties demand to dismiss these opinion polls when they are hostile to them
 saamanyat: nuksaan main rahane vaala pratibandh kii maang karata he, jabaki phaayde main rahane vaala use jari rakhane main paksh main hota he
 Jaitley said, "ban on such poll cannot be considered on the basis of who is raising such demand
" spasht taur par (opinian) pole abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kaa ang he
 Banning them is neither constitutionally permissible, nor desirable
 'haal ke kai opinian pole main bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ko rahul gandhi se aage bataaya gaya he, rahul gandhi ko congress ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 According to opinion poll on assembly elections, BJP is going to win easily in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘yadi is desh main vaid tareeke se opinian pole par roak laga di jaae to aglaa kadam raajnneetik tippaneekaron ke vishleshan karne par roak lagaana hoga jo kuch ke paksh main jabaki kuch ke virodh main hota he
 'the Election Commission wrote to the parties - Tell or not to be banned
 In a letter to the presidents of all recognized parties and the general secretaries, the Commission has said,' The Commission wants to conduct an opinion poll during the elections and publish its results or The Commission should be made aware of the proposal to ban broadcasting
 kripaya 21 oktober 2013 tak apane vichaar se avgat karaaen
 'earlier, the Election Commission had proposed to the government to ban the Opinion Poll, after which the Government asked the Commission to re-discuss the issue with various parties
 pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj desh ko eastern peripheral express-ve (EPE) ke rup main sabase hitech express-ve kaa tohfa de rahe hai

 Yes yes agar ye khushkhabari sach sabit ho gai to sanjay dutt naa sirf vakt se pehle jal se reeha ho sakate hai balki bahut mumkin he ki baaki kii tamaam sazaa hi maaf ho jaae
 Actually, the central government has sought the opinion of the Maharashtra government to waive the rest of Sanjay Dutt's sentence
 sanjay dutt paanch saal main se kareeb do saal kii sajaa puri kar chuke hai
 The remaining three-year sentence is still pending
 yadi unki sajaa maaf hui to unhen jail main sanjay dutt ko lipaphe nahin banane padenge
 Munna will not have to do the acting in jail
 munna ko kaidi kii vardi or topi nahin pahanani padegi, unki betaratib dadhi badi hui nahin hogi
 Sanjay Dutt has been sentenced to 5 years by the Supreme Court for illegal possession of arms in the 1993 serial ballast in Mumbai
 inamen se sanjay dutt 18 maheene kii sajaa 1993 main hi giraftaar ke dauraan kaat chuke the
 Sanju Baba arrived at Yerwada Jail in Pune on May 15 to complete the remaining three-and-a-half-year sentence and stayed there till 30 sibantar
 ek oktober ko kaidiyon ko khaas vajahon se milane vaali farlo ke tahat unhen 14 din kii jail se chuttee mili thi
 Later this holiday was extended for 14 more days due to illness
 is hisaab se sanjay dutt philhal 28 oktober tak jail se baahar hai
 On 29 October, he will have to go back to Yerwada Jail so that he can serve the remaining 42 months
 ab to bas khat ke jawaab kaa intjantb sanjay dutt ke maafi ke masale par ab centre sarkaar ne maharashtra sarkaar se raay maangi he
 The Center has written a letter to the Maharashtra government asking whether Sanjay Dutt, a criminal convicted for illegal possession of arms in 1993, can be pardoned under Section 161 of the Indian Constitution
 jaahir he, agar is maamle par maharashtra sarkaar kaa jawaab haa main aata he, to bahut mumkin he ki sanjay dutt apni baaki ke takreeban teen saal kii sazaa puri hone se pehle hi khuli hawa main saans le sakate hai
 As soon as the punishment was announced to Sanjay Dutt, the President of the Press Council of India, Justice Markandey Katju, not only cited the Article 161 of the Constitution, advocated an apology to Sanjay, but also requested the Prime Minister and the President for the same
 tab to is maamle ko lekar desh bhar main kaafii bahes hoti rahi, lekin ab is maamle ko thodaa vaqt guzarate hi centre sarkaar ne maharashtra sarkaar se sanjay kii rihaai ke masale par raay maang kar is baat ke ishaare kar die hai ki wo bhi munna bhai ko sazaa puri hone se pehle hi rihaai kaa tohfa dene ke haq main he
 You will get the fruits of the family's goodness
 sanjay dutt par shaayad dutt parivaar kii achchhaayiyon kii taasir nazil hone vaali he
 The goodness of the Dutt family was also mentioned in Justice Katju's request to the Governor for forgiveness of Sanjay's sentence
 katju ne likhaa tha, 'naa to sanjay dutt mumbai dhamaakon ke gunaahagaar hai or naa hi sanjay dutt kaa koi purana criminal trek record he
 Moreover, Sanjay Dutt's family and Sanjay Dutt himself have given a lot to the society
 aise main sanjay dutt ko samvidhan kii dhara 161 ke mutabik arms act ke is maamle main sazaa se maafi di ja sakati he
 ' desh kii vipakshi party bijepi ke andar antarkalah lagaataar gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Former RSS spokesperson MG Vaidya has written in his blog that Gujarat CM Narendra Modi may be behind the wind that is being spread against party president Nitin Gadkari
 vaidya ne apane blog main likhaa he ki bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad or varisht vakil ram jethmalani ne jo gadakari ke khilaaf aarope lagaae hai or karrwai kii maang kii he uske peeche kii manshaa narendra modi kii jaan padati he
 He said that it is too early to speculate about who will be the prime ministerial candidate from the party in 2014
 vaidya ne aage likhaa ki hamalogon (bijepi) ko aapas main jhagadne ke bajaae ekajute hona hoga
 At the same time he writes that Narendra Modi may have felt that Gadkari as the party president might stall his becoming the Prime Minister, hence he used Jethmalani to remove Gadkari

 Looking at the interactions of top leaders of other parties including Congress, Left and JDU, it seems that the opposition will field its candidate
 agar aisa hota he to chunaav main muqabla kadaa hone ke asaar hai
 The BJP leader said that there is a presidential election on July 17, in view of which there is no question of national executive meeting in Andhra Pradesh on July 15 and 16
 bijepi kaaryakarini kii baithak kii taarikh jab tay kii gai thi tab tak chunaav ayog ne raashtrapati pad ke chunaav kaa kaarykram ghoshit nahin kiya tha
 The Election Commission announced the schedule of presidential elections on 7 June
 adhisuchana jari kiye jane ke baad 14 june se namakan prakriya shuru hogi or matganana 20 july ko dilli main hogi
 It is clear that in view of the mobilization of opposition parties for the election, the ruling BJP does not want to have any slack in the election of the President, due to which it is necessary for Amit Shah, considered the party's biggest strategist, to stay in Delhi till he is declared the presidential candidate

 trinmul congress dwaara samarthan waapas liye jane ke baad bahumat banaae rakhane kii koshish main juty sarkaar ke mukhiya isse pehle apane shashan ko baahar se samarthan de rahe sapa netaa mulaayam singh yadav or basapa pramukh mayawati se alag-alag bhoj baithken pehle hi kar chuke hai

 However, the Prime Minister usually invites senior members of the main opposition party to a banquet before every Parliament session

 The Lokpal Bill, corruption issues and inflation etc
 are also likely to be discussed with BJP members
 trinmul congress ke upie se samarthan waapas le lene ke baad bhi 545 sadasyeey loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paas abhi bahumat ke liye jaruri 273 se adhik sadasyon kaa samarthan sunishchit dikh rahaa he
 If a total of 43 members of SP and BSP supporting him from outside also remain together, then this figure will cross 300
 lekin agar epadiai par matdaan hota he to pradhanmantri ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki upie ke samarthan kaa yah aankada bana rahe
 The DMK, which has 18 Lok Sabha members in the UPA, is yet to open its cards on FDI
 uske bina epadiai ke paksh main abhi sadan main 243 sadasyon ko mana ja saktaa he
 205 members of the opposition are still adopting a strong stand against FDI
 aise main dramuk ke 18, basapa ke 21, sapa ke 22, akali dal ke chaar, bijd ke 14 or 17 anya sadsy khel kaa paas palat sakate hai
 The government needs the support of just 30 of these to cross the magical figure of 273

 In such a situation, it will have to try to mobilize the support of only 13 other members

 something similar has been fed by Asaram's Kaput Narayan Sai, who betrayed a divorced girl to a man Got married, whose land used to run the center of his marriage
 ladki ko narayan sai ne bolne or kuch sochane tak kaa mauka nahin diya
 Within a few days, the girl came to know that she was cheated by a person whom she believed to be God
 itnaa hi nahin jab vah ladki narayan se ye shikaayat karne pahunchi ki usne jisase uski shaadi karai he vah talakshuda nahin he, to narayanasai ne uske saath ye jaanate hue ashleel harakat kii ki vah garbhvatee he
 At the same time, the girl constantly threatened to kill her for miscarriage
 peedit mahila kaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha kii vah khubasurat thi, jis par narayan sai kii gandi najar thi or vahi se shuru hue uske musiibat ke din
 a divorced girl whose entire family considered Bapu and Narayan as God
 indore main asaram ke ashram ke thik paas rahete the, dinaank 10 disambar 2004 ko narayan sai ne apane kareebi ishwar vadhvani ko apni kutiyaa (farmahouse, jo ishwar kaa hi he) ko bulawaaya
 Also called the woman
 dopaher do baje ishwar ko apana bhakt bataate hue mahila kii shaadi usase karvaa di
 In this marriage, only the family of God was there whereas there was no one from the woman's house
 narayan ne mahila se kaha ki ye mere nahin, bhagwaan ke aadesh se ho rahaa he
 Then Narayan called the woman's father and said that he had got his daughter married
 vah apane sasuraal ja rahi he, use aashirwad dena
 The educated English-speaking woman was unaware of the deception
 lekin shaadi ke do maah baad hi garbhvatee hui or pati ke badalte swabhaav se use pataa chal gaya kii vah dhokhe kaa shikaar hui
 Three months after her marriage, she finds out that the God she is married to has not divorced from his first wife
 use garbh giraane kii dhamkee mil rahi thi
 The woman decided that she would not commit feticide and give birth to a child
 lihaaja usapar musiibat ke pahaad tuutane lage
 She ran away and came to her maternal home
 29 janvari ko narayan sai apane janmdin ke din indore ke mau main pravachan ke liye aaye to peedit mahila ne sochaa ki narayan sai se puuchhen ki unhone uski jindagi kyon bighad di
 Thinking of this, when the woman reached Mhow, Narayan called her to her bedroom and before she could speak, Narayan Sai did indecent acts with her
 is ghatana ke baad mahila kaa apane bhagwaan se puraa bharosa uth gaya
 After all the trouble, she gave birth to a son on 1 September and named him Hari
 lekin is bachche kaa durbhaagya dekhiye ki iske baap ne ise apana hone se inkaar kar diya or yahi se shuru hui us maan ke sangharshon kii kahani jo apane bete ko pita kaa naam dene ke liye aaj bhi lard rahi he
 
 
 In 2004, the victim filed an FIR against her husband for dowry harassment and assault
 lekin vidmbana dekhiye ki police ne exiaar darj kii lekin usamen narayan sai ke kukrity kaa ullekh bhi nahin kiya
 The case reached the court where the woman in writing told the court the fraud of Narayan Sai
 lekin karodpati ishwar vadhvani or narayan sai ke khilaaf maamla dekhakar vakeelon kii laar tapaki
 So the paper game started with the woman
 ab mahila ko asaram kii karatuuton ke samaacharon main aane se himmat mili or tamaam dhamkiyon ko darkinar karte hue vah espi anil kushavaah ke offis shikaayat ke saath guuruuvaar ko ja pahunchi lekin vahaan se bhi khaali haath lauti
 Now on Friday, the woman is going to present a complaint in the court against Narayan Sai and her Aziz Ishwar Wadhwani, in the hope that she will get justice and that her son will get the father's name and Narayan Sai can be punished for his sins

 On this issue, the Aam Aadmi Party said in a press conference that there is only one solution to the ongoing sealing in Delhi and that solution is with the BJP government at the Center
 bhaajapa kii sarkaar adhyadesh laati he to hi dilli kii ceiling ruk sakati he lekin bhaajapa aisa nahin kar rahi he
 There is only one solution to stop sealing and that is ordinance, ordinance and only ordinance
 aam aadmi party pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki‘rajdhanidellimein pehali ceiling dephence colony market main hui thi, hamane us vakt bhi kaha tha ki yah dilli ke vyapaariyon se paisa ikattha karne kii ek saazish he

 bjp's MCD is doing the sealing, bjp's police is running the poles on the traders, then the BJP leaders come in front and tell the traders that we will do something, the interesting thing is that there is an ordinance to stop the sealing
 bjp's central government has to be brought, but BJP is not bringing ordinance
 puri dilli ke log or vyapaaree ye baat samaj chuke hai ki bhaajapa ke dwaara hi ceiling karai ja rahi he or bhaajapa hi ceiling ko rukvaa sakati he

 Ceiling can stop

 Counsel for the conductor Ashok accused of Pradyuman murder case has claimed that Ashok is being implicated in this murder case
 isse pehle bhi ashok kii bhoomika ko lekar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 However, it can also be said that Ashok's lawyer is doing what the defense counsel should do
 pradhyumna kii hatya ke badabas conductor ashokane police ke saamne apana gunaah kabool kiya tha
 Even on the camera of Aaj Tak, he confessed to the murder
 lekin is maamle main ab nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Actually, Ashok's lawyer Mohit Verma has claimed that Ashok is innocent
 bas conductor ashok ke vakil mohit verma kaa kahana he ki ashok ko is maamle main fansaaya gaya he
 The police and the school management pressurized Ashoka and badly tortured him by the police to confess the charge
 is khulaase ne ek baar phir is puure maamle par sawalia nishaan laga die hai
 Earlier too, such a thing was revealed that Ashok is probably being made a pawn in this sensational case of murder
 lekin tafteesh or sabooton ne ashok ko hi is maamle main aaropee paaya
 Even in the CCTV camera installed outside the school toilet, Ashok was seen coming and going
 haalanki is baat ko is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki mohit verma aaropee ashok ke vakil hai or bachaav paksh ke vakil kaa kaam apane muvakkil ko aakhir tak bachaana hota he
 But this statement of the lawyer is once again under investigation in the matter

 Then Pradyumna reached there and saw Ashok in an objectionable condition
 tabhi ashok ne use toilet main khinch liya tha, phir vah bachche ke saath galat kaam karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 But the child started making noise
 virodh karne laga
 Just then, Ashoka pulled out the knife and stabbed the child's neck one after the other
 jisase pradhyumna kii gardan se khun kii dhara foot padi
 During this time some blood spots also came over Ashoka
 vah toilet se baahar nikal gaya tha
 For about half an hour, accused Ashok wandered in blood-soaked clothes

 abhinayta aftab shivadaasaani ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki kamabakht ishk ke hero akshay kumaar ko ve kin shabdon main shukriya kahen
 Now the first question here is the reason for saying thank you and the second question is Aftab's relationship with this film? It is infamous for the role to be cut
 To answer both these questions, it is necessary to remember this statement of Akshay said in the press conference of Kambakkht Ishq
 Aftab is playing an important role in the film
 par apni filmon main saathi kalakaaron ke role katwane ke liye khaase badnaam rahe akshay ne jis andaaj main unka zikr kiya, usase ek aise shaks jise junior artist tak kaha jane laga tha, kaa bhavuk hona kya galat tha
 So now Aftab can only say this - Thank you Akki

 In the same episode, Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot on Monday attacked the Vasundhara Rajeshkar in Jaipur
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki agar congress satta main ai to vasundhara raaje ke ishaare par kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ko jail kii hawa khaani padegi
 Gehlot said, "IT, Mining, Jaipur Police in Rajasthan is a den of corruption
" yahaan par iees adhikariyon kaa ek giroh karpshan kar rahaa he
 The robbery is being done in the name of event management
 vasundhara raaje ke liye kaam karne vaale adhikariyon ko jail janaa pad saktaa he
 "amit Shah was also attacked by former CM of Hamarajya Ashok Gehlot
 unhone kaha ki shah ko vasundhara raaje ke naam se chunaav main jane main dar lag rahaa he isliye modi ke naam par vot maang rahe hai
 Shah does not have the right to come to Rajasthan unless he clarifies about his son Jai Shah
 unhone aage kaha ki shah, rajasthan main bangladesh or akhlaaq kaa masalaa uthaakar hindu-musalmaan karnaa chaah rahe hai
 Action will be taken against the culprits in our government, Congress General Secretary Ashok Gehlot said that in the current tenure of the state government, there has been a lot of corruption in all the schemes including immersion Rajasthan
 sarkaar ke mahatvapurn vibhaag karpshan main aakanth duube hue he
 Gehlot said that in the last term, the BJP had made a mistake by creating a commission against the corruption of the government, but this time after the formation of the government, an inquiry will be conducted immediately and action will be taken against the culprits
 gahalot ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke shashan kaal main mukhyamantri kaa puraa focus mining, department, piechdi, jaipur kamishnaret or iti department par rahaa he
 All these departments remain the hub of corruption, the Chief Minister is busy flying by helicopter, he is not aware of what is happening in the state
 bhaajapa sarkaar ne janata kaa apmaan kiyagalot ne kaha ki janata ne bhaajapa sarkaar ko aitihaasik bahumat diya tha
 But the failure of the BJP government has insulted the people's mandate
 satta main aate hi congress kii laabhakaari yojanaon kaa band kar diya gaya
 He further said that the CM of the state does not even have five functions to tell
 mukhyamantri gaurav yatra ke dauraan baar-baar sawaal kar rahi hai ki congress ne 50 saal main jo nahin kiya vah 5 saal main kar dikhaaya he
 Actually, the BJP has ruled the state for 18 years in the last 28 years, but the current 5-year government has completely failed in return for the overall development of the 10-year term of the Congress
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki vasundhara sarkaar ne congress kii vikaas yojana or kaaryakramon ke naam badal die
 100 crore for Anganwadi workers, 100 crore ABC fund for minority welfare fund stopped
 iske alaava rifinary, metro second phej, duungarpur bansawada ratlam rail pariyojna, prabandh sinchai or peyajal pariyojna, memu coach factory, dhaulpur se sarmathpura nairogese kaa canvarjan or saramthura se gangapore tak nai broadgej line, ajmer nasirabad savai madhopur railway jaisi mahatvapurn pariyojnaon ko latakaae rakhaa he

 rajasthan kii sarkaar ne bhamashah swasthya beemaa yojana ko laakar nishulk dawa yojana ko kamjor karne kaa hi kaam kiya he
 The CAG report made serious comments about these schemes but despite repeated questions about the nexus between insurance companies and private hospitals, payments have been raised by making fake bills
 chikitsa vibhaag ne bhi beemaa company ke 106 crores rupee kii raashi ko roak diya he jo ki dikhaata he ki sarkaar kii flagship yojana kaa kya haal he
 Ashok Gehlot said that on the issue of employment, Vasundhara Raje had promised a government job to 1
5 million youths
 rashtriya str par berogari kii dar 6% he lekin rajasthan main yah dar badhkar 10% pahunch gai he
 The chief minister is claiming 16 lakh jobs for the youth
 jabaki sieji kii report bataati he 1 lakh 27 hajaar 817 prashikshan praapt yuvaaon main se 42 hajaar 758 yuvaaon ko hi rojgaar diya gaya he
 Only 9904 have been found to be genuine upon verification
 ashok gahalot ne labhaarthiyon ke kaarykram par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki bhaajapa sarkaar ne pradesh main pehali baar labhaarthi or vanchit ke naam se do alag- alag varg bana die hai
 Questioning the Bhamashah Digital Parivar Yojana, Gehlot said that an arrangement has been made to make available one thousand rupees for mobile from the government treasury
 lekin is yojana par kharch hone vaale 1000 crores rupee kaa laabh keval ek company vishesh ko hi milegaa
 Raising the debt burden of Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot questioned Gaurav Yatra and said that the Chief Minister is engaged in pursuing political interests on populist announcements
 lekin iske liye naa to koi bajet kaa praavdhaan he or naa hi in yojanaon ko puraa karnaa mukhyamantri ke bas main he
 Gehlot further said that according to the CAG report, Rajasthan had a debt burden of Rs 1 lakh 17 thousand 809 crore in 2012-13 at the time of Congress, whereas today the BJP government has put the burden of double its amount on the people of the state

 In the remaining two phases, all eyes are on UP

 vahiin sapa - basapa gathbandhan kii ore se kai baar yah bataane kii koshish kii gai he ki vipaksh kaa pradhanmantri ummidavaar isi gathbandhan se ho saktaa he
 BSP chief Mayawati recently indicated in a public meeting that if all goes well, she will contest the Lok Sabha elections and may also become the Prime Minister
 mayawati ke bayaan ke do din baad hi sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav ne is par muhar laga di he or unhone kaha he ki main bhi unhen pradhanmantri banate hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 Talking to the English newspaper Mumbai Mirror, Akhilesh said, 'after the alliance, i have got a lot of opportunity to know about them, i have also seen a lot of goodness in them
 vah kaaphi anushaasit hai or mujhase anbhavi bhi hai
 The SP chief said, "there is a generation gap between him and us, i will be happy to see him become Prime Minister, for this i am also ready to work hard
" vahiin, vah bhi mujhe uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri dekhne ke liye taiyaar hai
 'it is important to note that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the entire Bharatiya Janata Party are tight on the opposition that who if not Modi? And the opposition seemed to be lagging behind on this matter every time, but now after completing five steps, Mayawati has openly submitted her claim
 or unka saath akhilesh yadav ne bhi de diya he
 Please tell that Uttar Pradesh is the largest state in the country, where there are 80 Lok Sabha seats
 sapa-basapa milakar in siton par lard rahe hai or unke saath ralod bhi he
 According to the opinion poll before the election, the SP-BSP could have a big advantage in these elections and if it happens then both the parties can play the role of kingmaker
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki vipaksh main kai aise chehre hai jo pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar hai, lekin unamem se kuch hi aise chehre hai jinpar kai vipakshi dal sahamat ho pate hai
 Mayawati's claim is strong because she is an experienced leader as well as a Dalit, so she hopes that no one will oppose her outright and support her when circumstances arise

 ' a new controversy has arisen in Madhya Pradesh over the frequent transfers of officers
 alam ye he ki 15 saal baad madhyapradesh kii satta main ai congress sarkaar ke 5 maheene ke kaarykaal main kareeb-kareeb 500 adhikariyon ke tabadale ho chuke hai
 In this, officers of other grades including IAS, IPS and IFS have been transferred
 aaj tak ne jab lagaataar ho rahe tabadalon par vidhi mantri pisi sharma se baat kii to unhone ise ek saamaanya prakriya bataaya
 Minister Sharma said that 'this is a normal process and any new government transfers officers to bring tightness in the system
 bhartiya janata party ke jamaane main to paise lekar posting hoti thi kamalnath or congress kii sarkaar main koi is tareeke kii baat nahin he
 The posting of the one where there is utility is being done
 sharma ne kaha ki yah sau chuuhe khaakar billi haj ko chali vaala maamla he bhartiya janata party kaa
 'even though the government is describing it as a normal process, but one truth is that the expenditure on the transfers of the officers is probably not the attention of the government
 darasal kisi bhi akhil bhartiya seva ke afasar kaa tabadalaa jab hota he to us tabadale ke dauraan hone vaala kharch sarkaar kii taraf se uthaaya jaataa he
 This includes the cost of traveling from one place to another by the same shifting officer and his family members
 aapako bataa den ki akhil bhartiya seva ke afasar yaa parijanon ko first class tak kaa kiraaya diya jaataa he
 Now if we look at the figures, it will be known that due to the transfers of about 500 officers in Madhya Pradesh, the exchequer has been burdened with about 32 crore rupees
 isamen yadi tabadale ke dauraan milane vaale vaitanaik avkaash ko chhod bhi den to bhi aankada 12 karod ke lagbhag baithegaa
 In the form of transfer grant alone, these officers get 80% of their salary and in terms of number of officers, this amount is about Rs 8 crores
 ye rakam isliye zyada he kyonki kai afasar aise hai jinka beete maheenon main ek se zyada baar tabadalaa hua he
 In this case, the amount they receive during the transfer also increases
 vahiin shifting ke dauraan samaan ko ek jagah se duusari jagah pahunchane ke liye transportesan kharche ke rup main inhen 50 rupye prati kilometre diya jaataa he
 The 'government running the transfer industry', on the other hand, BJP has repeatedly accused the government of running the 'transfer industry' among the transfers

 a road show took place in different areas of Ajmer, starting from Pushkar
 sachin payalat ne teenon siten jeetne kaa daawa kiyasachin payalat ne kaha ki ham teenon siten jeet rahe hai
 In fact, the Congress has called it a referendum on the bjp's 4-year term, so the BJP wants to win these three seats before the assembly elections and show that there is no factor of anti-incumbency in the state
 udhar ashok gahalot gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke baad majboot banakar ubhare hai
 In such a situation, to save his existence in Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot has to show that the public likes him
 BJP ke liye vidhansabhachunavse pehle in teenon siton ko jeetna jaruri he
 This is seen as a reference to the 4-year tenure of the Vasundhara government

 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is also exerting full power in the promotion of Congress

 delivery ke baad aksar mahilaon ke saamne bal jhadane kii samasya aati he
 Although many types of medicines are also available for this, but it is advisable to avoid them while the woman is breastfeeding

 3
 agar aapaki diet acchhee he to aapako kisi bhi tarah kii dawaai lene kii jarurat nahin he

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter desh videsh ke kai vaigyanik mangal grah (mars) par jivan he yaa nahin is par bahut si richars or daawey kar chuke hai, jiske baad ek baar phir mangal grah par jivan kii sambhaavna kii baat uthi he
 a researcher at Ohio University believes that there has been evidence of insect-like organisms on Mars
 professor ameritas wiliam romosrake shodh main keet jaise jeevon ke kai udhaaharan paae gaye hai, jo kaaphi had tak madhumakhiyon kii tarah yaa phir reptiles jaise dikhte hai
 Life is possible before and still on Mars, said Romosar
 mars rovers dwaara lee gai kai tasveeron main jeevashm or jivit jantu dikhaai die hai
 "there is a clear diversity among Martian insect-like organisms, which exhibit many characteristics similar to insects
 romosar ne aage kaha, inhen ucch samoohon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 For example, the presence of wings, wing flexion, agile gliding and various structured leg elements, etc
 romosar ne kaha ki jab martian rovers, jaivik gatividhi ke sanketak kii talash kar rahe the to unhone kai tasviren dekhin, jo keet or reptiles jaise roopon ko spasht rup se darshaati hai
 Many photographs show images where the arthropod body segment, legs, antennae and wings can be seen separated from the surrounding area
 har ek tasviir kaa adhyayan photography ke alag-alag staron par kiya gaya he, jisamen britaness, contrast, seturation, invarjan or bahut si chije shaamil hai
 Also, nothing has been added or removed
 romosar ke shodh main istemaal kiye gaye maandand main parivesh se rup kii spashtataa, sharir kii samarupata, sharir ke angon kaa vibhaajan, dohraye jane vaale rup, kankal avshesh or ek duusare se nikatataa main, roopon kaa avlokan aadi shaamil he
 Special posture, evidence of motion, flight, explicit interaction, as suggested by relative positions and the bright eyes represented by the appearance of living forms
 romosar ne kaha, ek baar kisi die gaye form kii spasht chhavi kii pahchaan or varnan kiya gaya tha, jiskaa upyog kam spasht chizon kii manyata ko suvidhajanak banane main gaya tha lekin koi bhi tasviir kam maanya nahin he"
 An exoskeleton and joint appendages are sufficient to identify it as an arthropod
 teen sharir kshetra, anti kii ek jodi or chah pair paramparaagat rup se prithvi par 'keet' kii pahchaan ke liye kaaphi he
 Similarly, to identify an organism on Mars, these characteristics should be seen as characteristic of insects
 in aadhaaron par mangal rover kii tasveeron main aarthropod, keet-jaise jeev dekhe ja sakate hai
 "these creatures resemble bees on Earth
 anya tasveeron main ye "madhumakhiyaan" gufaaon main aashray yaa ghonsle ke rup main dikhaai di hai
 "the presence of high metazoan organisms reflects the possibility of life on Mars as the presence of nutrients / energy sources and processes, food chains and webs, and the presence of water in a viable as the presence of high metazoan organisms

 desh ke purv grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia punjab congress ke prabharee mahasachiv banaae ja sakate hai
 Recently, Kamal Nath resigned soon after his appointment to this post
 jabaki tanker ghotaale main shila dikshit kaa naam uchhalane ke baad sonia gandhi ne ab punjab ke liye scindia par bharos jataayaa he
 In UP too, Jitin Prasad, a youth leader and close to Rahul Gandhi, will be given important responsibility
 prashanth kishor kii ranneeti par amalcongress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne sonia or rahul se ek bramhan cheharaa dene kii maang kii thi
 Jitin can be appointed as the President of Uttar Pradesh Congress or the Chairman of Election Campaign Committee instead of Nirmal Khatri
 dhire-dhire hi sahi lekin congress main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho gai he
 Looking after the large number of Dalit votes in Punjab, Sonia Gandhi has decided to make Shinde the general secretary in charge
 darasal kamalnath ke istife ke baad punjab main amarinder singh jaise kaddavar netaa ke saath talmail bithaane kii takat kuch congress netaaon main hi dikh rahi thi
 Sonia considered the names of several senior leaders, but Shinde has become the first choice of the Congress leadership given the number of Dalit voters in Punjab at around 30 per cent
 brahman-muslim sameekaran ke liye chehre kii talashsutron ke mutabik upi main bheepurv kendriya mantrior congress ke kaddavar netaa rahe jitendra prasad ke bete jitin prasad ko congress kaa nayaa cheharaa banaaya ja saktaa he

 anbhavi netaaon ko milegi nai jimmedaarigulam nabi aaazaad ko mistre kii jagah pehle hi upi kaa prabharee banaaya ja chukaa he
 Now Jitin can be made the state president or the head of the campaign committee
 daud main chal rahe naamon rajesh mishra or pramod tiwari ko bhi kisi cameti kaa adhyaksh banaaya jayega
 PL Punia will be the chairman of the manifesto committee
 vahiin rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ko bhi ahm jimmedaari di jaaegi
 Sonia wants a gradual change UP Congress President Nirmal Khatri said that no one is in a position forever
 philhal to main apane pad par hum
 Sources claim that instead of making big changes in the Congress simultaneously, Sonia wants to gradually change the face of the Congress
 sonia chaahati hai ki pehle varisht party netaaon ke anubhav kaa istemaal kiya jaye phir yuva team ko bhi unase joda jaae
 Rahul will become president after the coordination with the new team: Sonia Gandhi's strategy is to establish Rahul rapport with the changed Congress and only then he will be given the chair of the president
 vah chaahati hai ki party main peedigat badlaav aisa ho ki beterahul gandhi ke liehar mushkil aasaan ho jaae
 However, Sonia's decision on Priyanka Gandhi's role is yet to be made public

 a viewer is saying in his response that he would like to be in jail, but not to watch Race 3
 ye duniya kii sabase bekaar film he
 Race 3 Movie Review: Finding the logic in Salman's film is a useless, spicy-rich film, although the film has already done its cost, but the audience response is not a good sign for this
 samikshakon ke anusaar, yadi aap salmaan khan ke bahut bade fain hai or unki film dekhe bagaiyr rah nahin pate, to ek baar jaakar tri kar sakate hai
 Explain that the budget of the film is about 150 crores
 ek akhbaar kii khabar ke mutabiq, film ne kaaphi paisa relies se pehle hi kama liya he jisamen se 130 karod ke satellite ritis beche gaye hai
 Fans don't want Aamir to watch Salman's Race 3, know what he wrote? On Friday, Salman's brother-in-law Ayush Sharma arrived to watch 'race 3' with actress Varina Hussain, but Ayush got emotional while watching the film
 darasal, aayush or varina 'lavaratri' film se bollywood main debyue kar rahe hai
 The teaser of the film was released on Thursday
 iskaa tiger 'res 3' ke saath bhi dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 When Ayush saw himself on the big screen, he became emotional
 saal 2015 main ganatantr diwas ke din relies hui film 'baby' ke baad se akshay kumaar kii chhavi ek aise actor kii ban gai jo deshbhakti yaa janhit se jude muddon par filmein karata he
 It is known by all that on 26 January and 15 August, filmmakers are competing to release films which revolve around patriotism or issues related to it
 Gold kaa Monobina: dhooma machaa saktaa he akshay kii film kaa ye gaanaaise baar 15 agast ko akshay kumaar ek baar phir se deshbhakti se otprot film lekar aa rahe hai
 The name of the film is 'gold' and it tells the story of India's first Olympic gold medal
 film kii apakaming relies ke saath hi yah sawaal bhi isse jud gaya he ki kya gold akshay kii pichley swatantraaa diwas par relies hui movie "toilet ek prem katha" kaa record tod paaegi?akshay-maadhuri sang phir ricreat hoga 'dil to pagal he' kaa romance?pradhanmantri narendra modi ke 'svachh bharat mishan' par aadhaarit is film ne pehle hi din main 13 karod 10 lakh rupee kii kamai kii thi
 It is possible that if the film was released on August 15, its business would have been better
 lekin kyonki film 11 agast ko relies hui thi to aisa mana gaya ki isse film kaa bijness prabhavit hua he
 This time, Akshay's film Gold is releasing on the exact 15th of August
 tivi actress mauni roy pehali baar bade parde par najar aaengi
 Mouni is now debuting on the big screen after winning the hearts of people on the small screen for many years

 Lalu asked, 'what will JDU do now' After Narendra Modi became the chairman of the Lok Sabha Election Committee, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has quipped the JDU

 After targeting the central government, Modi, in his first address, became a target of the UPA government at the center
 unhone upie sarkaar ke 'bharat nirmaan' vaale vigyaapan par bhi chutki lee
 He said, 'the UPA advertisement says that i have a right to build India
 par sach to yah he ki bharat nirmaan par haq nahin, shaq he meraa
 He said, corruption charges are not affected by the central government
 bijepi ke kisi mukhyamantri par bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin he
 In such a situation, people's trust from the central government has been lost
 ab congress har kisi ke peeche sibiai chhod rahi he
 There is no opposition leader left behind by the CBI
 naksalwad ke mudde par congress ko aade haathon lete hue modi ne kaha, sarkaar kii nitiyon ke kaaran yuva bandook uthaane ke liye majaboor ho gaye hai
 The Congress is not worried about the youth of the country

 The government has weakened the Planning Commission by creating a National Advisory Council (NAC)

 'modi said with a roar,' The Prime Minister was healthy, he did not move, but consciousness came to me after listening to me
 maine kaha pradhanmantri ji khud aapke planning kamishan main ek cameti ke chairman maovadiyon se jude hue hai
 Addressing the workers, Modi said, "may we appear in the newspaper or not, do not shine on TV, try to reach the hearts of the people
" 'adwani par saadhaa paroksh nishanaanarendra modi adwani samet anya netaaon par us vakt paroksh rup se nishaanaa sadhate hue dikhaai diye jab unhone party adhyaksh rajnath singh kii tarif karte hue kaha ki unki dariyaadilii ko baahar baithe log nahin samajhenge
 After being made the chairman of bjp's election campaign committee, Modi said, 'I am very grateful to the party president Rajnath Singh that he has not only entrusted me with new responsibilities but has also given a lot of respect in front of the workers and people of the country
 ’ modi ne kaha, ‘rajnath ji bolne ke liye khadey hue or mujhe baithne ko kaha
 It is difficult for those sitting outside to understand its importance
 koi vyakti keval pad hone par aisa nahin karata balki uske liye bada dil hona bhi jaruri he
 This is called generosity, which the party president showed
 ’ modi ne isse zyada kuch nahin kaha lekin mana ja rahaa he ki aisi tippanee karke unhone adwani or kuch anya netaaon kii ore ishaara kiya jo rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main shaamil nahin hue

 The World Bank has agreed to provide a support of Rs 2,100 crore for grooming the tourist destinations
 rajya ke paryaton mantri om prakaash singh ne ko die saakshaatkaar main ye baaten kahin
 Singh said in a special conversation that the government is concerned about the development of tourist destinations in the state
 paryaton sthalon ko vishwastareey banane kaa kaam agle kuch samay main shuru kiya jayega
 Om Prakash Singh said, 'the government is taking several steps to promote tourism in the state
 abhi vishwa bank ke saath ek samjhauta hua he, jiske tahat vah 2,100 karod rupee in paryaton kendron ke vikaas par kharch karegi
 Uttar Pradesh has been divided into four regions in terms of tourism and the government is trying to ensure proper development of every tourist destination
 ' singh ne kaha ki agra, mathura, sarnath, ayodhya or vrundavan ke aitihaasik or puranic mahatv ko dekhte hue in kendron par vishesh dhyaan diya jayega
 Asked Singh why Uttar Pradesh government is not branding tourist places to attract tourists like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh? In response to this question, the Tourism Minister said very clearly that the information department does not have enough money to make the branding of the tourist spots through advertisements and by making someone a brand ambassador
 sabase pehle yah baat samajni hogi ki paryaton sthalon kaa vikaas hi sabase mahatvapurn kaam he or is disha main sarkaar aage bad rahi he
 The Tourism Minister also informed that with the help of World Bank, the tourism sector of the state will get a new direction
 chunki, yah mukhyamantri kaa deam project bhi he, isiilie is kaam ko jald se jald puraa kiye jane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Singh said that there are many such places in the state, which will be of great benefit once they are developed
 udhaaharan ke taur par sarkaar agra main sthit tajganj kaa vikaas kar rahi he, varanasi ke ghaaton ke navinikaran or saaf-safai kaa kaam jald hi shuru kiya jayega
 When asked about the development of tourism areas of home district Ghazipur, he said, for the development of all the places in Ghazipur from the point of view of tourism, the government has allocated an amount of about 10 crores, including Kamakhya Dham Temple Development Head
 Is included in the form
 rajya main girti kanoon vyavastha ke sawaal par singh ne kaha, aap logon ko lagata he ki kanoon vyavastha kharaab he, lekin aisa nahin he
 Law and order deterioration is being propagated by the media
 vaastavik sthiti aisi nahin he
 Singh said that wherever the situation has deteriorated, the Chief Minister himself has come forward to take care of it
 rajya main hue dange hon yaa phir purv mantri raja bhaiya kaa prakaran, sabhi maamle main tatkaal or paardarshita ke saath karrwai kii gai he
 Constant efforts are being made to tarnish the image of the government
 gajipur sansadeey seat se chunaav ladane ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha, yah bilkul hi betuka sawaal he or unke liye loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladanaa koi maaene nahin rakhata
 According to him, he has already contested so much that he no longer feels the need
 pradesh str par jo ahm jimmedaari mili he, usee ko acchhee tarah se nibhaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 For the past few years, the reason for the Smartphone Industry is the use of Artificial Intelligence Term in India, it has hardly happened before
 market ke lagbhag har mid range smartphone main ab artificial intelligence vaale feechar die jane kaa daawa kiya jaataa he
 However, now let's talk about the budget 2019, in which Artificial Intelligence has been mentioned
 kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne sansad main antarim bajet padhate hue kaha ki sarkaar neshnal centre for artificial intelligence kholegi or jald hi artificial intelligence portal launch kiya jayega
 He has said that the National AI portal will be developed soon
 nayaa artficial intelligence portal neshnal program onartificial intelligenceke saport main banaaya jayega
 Piyush Goyal has said that the Artfisher Intelligence program will be used to give people the benefit of AI and technology related to it
 iske neshnal centres banaae jaaenge jo hub ke taur par kaam karegaa
 Its 9 areas have been selected
 sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye AI portal main kya hoga or logon ko iskaa phayda kaise dilaayaa jayega philhal sarkaar ne bajet main ye nahin bataaya he
 But it is important for you to know what is Artificial Intelligence and how it can prove beneficial in your day to day life
 haa iske nuksaan bhi hai or duniya ke bade technolji diggaj maanate hai ki ye duniya ko khatre main daal sakati he
 The term was first used by John mccarthy in 1955
 inhen fadar of artificial intelligence bhi kaha jaataa he
 Broadly speaking, Artificial Intelligence is a part of computer science under which intelligent machines are made which react like humans and also work like humans
 artficial intelligence ke jariye mashin insaanon kii tarah problem solv kar sakati he
 Just like humans can learn things
 jaise ham or aap kisi kaam ke experience ko lekar aage or behatar karte hai thik usee tarah AI program bhi he
 Here too the machine can learn through it
 ek baat dhyaan main rakhen ki ye yah artficial intelligence kaa hissaa bhar he
 Because it also has many different parts
 inamen spich ricognishan, planning, larning or problem solving jaise skills hai
 Artificial intelligence based assistants are provided in smartphones
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan google assistant he
 The more you use it, the more accurate it will be
 yani ye aapse sikhta he
 Machine learning can also be called a part of artificial intelligence
 artificial intelligence ke phaayde or nuksaan 
 There are many advantages as well as disadvantages of artificial intelligence
 kaam sateek honge
 
 galatiyon kii gunjaaish nahin he
 
 mushkil se mushkil task aasaani se parform honge
 
 digital assistant aapaki madad karenge
 
 medical aplication main ise yuj karke ilaaj aasaan hoga
 What will be the loss? There will be no original creativity
 
 Jobs may also be reduced
 
 AI is preparing to create autonomous weapons that will be dangerous
 
 It is also dangerous for people's privacy
 
 Even though it is intelligent, but it is a machine
 jo aapaki sahaayta kar sakati he, lekin isse achche bure yaa niyam kanoon main fark nahin pataa or ye aage chalakar bada khatra ho saktaa he

 Indian Railways is adopting new ways to make up for its losses
 kiraye ke alaava anya sroton se paisa kamaane kii yojana par kaam kar rahi railway ab puure desh main steshnon par jamaa hone vaale kachare ko bechney kii taiyaari main he
 a senior railway official involved in working out ways to generate revenue from additional sources of fares said, "we are studying the proposal of a waste management group which has collected waste collected at railway stations for one and a half rupees per kilogram
 Is offered to buy
 'railway ne yatri kiraayon or malbhaade ke atirikt sroton se rajasav praapt karne ke tareeke khojane ke liye ek alag gaiyr-kiraaya rajasav nideshaalay banaaya he
 The waste management company will collect garbage from 24-hour stations
 kachra uthaane vaale karmchaariyon kaa hoga bimpsdhikari ne kaha, 'kachare ko ekatrit karnaa or uskaa nistaaran karnaa company kii jimmedaari he
 This waste will be used to generate energy and fertilizer
 ' prastaav ke mutabik, kachra ekatrit karne main shaamil karmchaariyon ke bime kii or steshnon par kachrapetiyon se ise le jane ke liye kaale plastic baigon ke praavdhaanon kijimmedaarikachara prabandhan company kii hogi
 Currently, to be lifted from 12 stations, Kacharakampani has offered garbage collection work at 12 stations, including Amritsar, Ambala, Haridwar, Jammu, Katra, Dehradun, Moradabad, Saharanpur, CST, Mumbai Central and Dadar
 pichley saal may main jab narendra modi yahaan se chunaav ladane ke liye parchaa bharne aae the to hamaari sadakon par pair rakhane kii jagah nahin thi
 i have seen many colors of the era, but in front of my people today, the wheel of time was spinning on the vocal voice of Narendra Modi
 mere log narendra modi main ek aise nayak kii chhavi dekh rahe the, jo chutki main unki har samasya ko hal kar denge
 He got a lot of support and when he became the Prime Minister of the country, our hopes of running on his knees started running like a marathon runner
 lekin intjaar main ek saal guzar gaya
 The rubbish of dirt that was lying on my side was not removed
 naa hatane ke asaar dikh rahe hai
 These days the members of Gangotri Youth Brigade are the new sweepers of our region
 30 se zyaada kaamkaaji ladke apane kaam par yaa padhai ke class jane se pehle subah mohalle kaa kooda uthaate hai, naalee saafe karte hai, saath main jhaadu laga kar apni gali kii safai karte hai
 When the municipal corporation dumped the garbage in the locality, the disgust of the officers, the complaints made in the Municipal Corporation, this ignorance caught the broom, shovel and cleaning trolley in their hands
 gangotri youth brigade adhyaksh gopal singh bataate hai, 'itani gandagee thi yahaan ki jivan basar karnaa mushkil ho gaya tha or ham log sarkari daftaron main shikaayat kar ke haar chuke the
 We were not able to get any government system of cleanliness, then we ourselves took up the task that we will clean
 ' This condition is not only in our locality, but in every street, on every road, you will find garbage
 kooday ke prabandhan ke isi gadabadjhaale ne is shahar ko desh ke gande shaharon kii pehali fehrist main shumaar kara diya he
 It is worth noting that in a city with a population of 19 lakhs, the daily garbage extraction is 600 metric tons
 500 metric ton kooda uthaane kaa daawa he lekin ramana damping kshetra kaa rasta kharaab he or graminon ke virodh se vahaan kooda nahin ja rahaa
 Plant operations in the Karsara dumping area are at a standstill
 kooda gharon main 23 band hai sirf do khule hai
 However, the Municipal Corporation has 2700 scavengers, 7 jcbs, 18 dumper, 9 dumper crears, 17 tankers, 11 hoppers and 32 small hoppers
 baavzood iske nagar nigam ke adhikari or meyar ye daawa karte hai ki kooda uthaane kii jald vyavastha ho jaayegi
 Waste management remains a major challenge for the Prime Minister in our city, his own parliamentary constituency
 karsada or ramana plant kaa haal behaal he
 The Municipal Corporation does not have a suitable place for disposal of garbage
 shahar sankari galiyon kaa he
 There is no free space for garbage here
 container rakhane main bhi fajihat he
 The garbage houses are demolished, in such a way, 600 metric tonne of garbage is plaguing people between the streets and streets and this is the situation when our mps, mlas and Mayors have been BJP only for the last several decades
 jo aaj bhi in kudon kii nahin balki svachh or sundar kaashi ke sapane hi dikhaa rahe hai
 If BJP leaders see God in Modi kaashi to shiv kii he or mujhe sari hakeekat pataa he
 Modi came to my courtyard and said that he has been called by Ganga
 pradhanmantri ban gaye to bhi aae the
 At my eighty ghat
 jhaadu bhi uthaaya
 Shovel also
 jis ganga se logon ko moksh miltaa he, jab pradooshan ke hathiyaaron se use hi maaraa ja rahaa ho, tab use bachaane kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 But what are promises, what about promises
 meri ungaliyon ko jab bhi ganga chooti hai to gandagi or pradooshan se uski aatma par chai pidaa mujhe mahasoos hoti he
 Modi came
 kal bhi aaenge
 But our pain remains the same
 mere gaanv aaj bhi pichde hai
 One of the backward villages, Jayapur, was adopted by Prime Minister Modi
 mujhe bhi khushi hui ki mere ek gaanv kaa kayakalp ho jayega
 This happiness is indeed changing in reality as well, along with rotting seed water, other basic facilities have become like cities
 par ham aapako ye apane shahar kii haqiqat bataate hai ki kaise khastahal sadak or dhul kii vajah se shahar kii zindagi bezaar ho gai he
 If you are suffering from respiratory disease, asthma and asthma and want to come to your Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency these days, then be careful because the dust mites in the air and the carbon of the vehicles can increase your disease
 or jo log in bimariyon se grast nahin hai wo bhi satark rahen kyonki banaras kii fizaa khatarnaak str tak pradooshit ho chuki he
 Not only these things, the pollution department is also saying this
 pradooshan vibhaag ke tii en singh bataate he ki vascular polution he, jo gaadiyaan shahar main aa rahi hai, banaras shahar main dashakon se khudaai chal rahi he, uske jo partical hai wo ud rahe hai, jensett se bahut samasya he, uskaa bhi bahut asar pad rahaa he or menley jo vascular polution he wo 80 se 85 fisadi count kar rahaa he
 Surprising figures of this poison dissolving in the air of Banaras came to light when Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the National Air Quality Index a week ago
 iske suchakank bataa rahe hai ki banaras kii fijaa saans lene laayak nahin he
 The sensor of the orderly market index of Banaras shows that the average of the quantity of PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter
 yah nunatam 110 or adhiktam 427 darz kiya gaya
 While its level should be less than 60 microns per cubic centimeter
 isi tarah 10 micron se chote aakaar ke dhul ke kan maanak se 7 guna zyaada paae gaye
 PM2 in that order
 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 yani ye maanak se 12 guna adhik he
 On how dangerous the particles dissolved in air, BH Tripathi BD Tripathi says, 'particulate matter size which should be 100 microns per cubic centimeter is getting 300 to 400
 ye bahut khatarnaak dyotak he
 It indicates that the air of Banaras is not breathable
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure 
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 These days the members of Gangotri Youth Brigade are the new sweepers of our region
 30 se zyaada kaamkaaji ladke apane kaam par yaa padhai ke class jane se pehle subah mohalle kaa kooda uthaate hai, naalee saafe karte hai, saath main jhaadu laga kar apni gali kii safai karte hai

 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 Modi came to my courtyard and said that he has been called by Ganga
 pradhanmantri ban gaye to bhi aae the
 At my eighty ghat
 jhaadu bhi uthaaya
 Shovel also
 jis ganga se logon ko moksh miltaa he, jab pradooshan ke hathiyaaron se use hi maaraa ja rahaa ho, tab use bachaane kaa vaada bhi kiya tha
 But what are promises, what about promises
 meri ungaliyon ko jab bhi ganga chooti hai to gandagi or pradooshan se uski aatma par chai pidaa mujhe mahasoos hoti he
 Modi came
 kal bhi aaenge
 But our pain remains the same
 mere gaanv aaj bhi pichde hai
 One of the backward villages, Jayapur, was adopted by Prime Minister Modi
 mujhe bhi khushi hui ki mere ek gaanv kaa kayakalp ho jayega
 This happiness is indeed changing in reality as well, along with rotting seed water, other basic facilities have become like cities
 par ham aapako ye apane shahar kii haqiqat bataate hai ki kaise khastahal sadak or dhul kii vajah se shahar kii zindagi bezaar ho gai he
 If you are suffering from respiratory disease, asthma and asthma and want to come to your Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency these days, then be careful because the dust mites in the air and the carbon of the vehicles can increase your disease
 or jo log in bimariyon se grast nahin hai wo bhi satark rahen kyonki banaras kii fizaa khatarnaak str tak pradooshit ho chuki he
 Not only these things, the pollution department is also saying this
 pradooshan vibhaag ke tii en singh bataate he ki vascular polution he, jo gaadiyaan shahar main aa rahi hai, banaras shahar main dashakon se khudaai chal rahi he, uske jo partical hai wo ud rahe hai, jensett se bahut samasya he, uskaa bhi bahut asar pad rahaa he or menley jo vascular polution he wo 80 se 85 fisadi count kar rahaa he
 Surprising figures of this poison dissolving in the air of Banaras came to light when Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the National Air Quality Index a week ago
 iske suchakank bataa rahe hai ki banaras kii fijaa saans lene laayak nahin he
 The sensor of the orderly market index of Banaras shows that the average of the quantity of PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter
 yah nunatam 110 or adhiktam 427 darz kiya gaya
 While its level should be less than 60 microns per cubic centimeter
 isi tarah 10 micron se chote aakaar ke dhul ke kan maanak se 7 guna zyaada paae gaye
 PM2 in that order
 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 yani ye maanak se 12 guna adhik he
 On how dangerous the particles dissolved in air, BH Tripathi BD Tripathi says, 'particulate matter size which should be 100 microns per cubic centimeter is getting 300 to 400
 ye bahut khatarnaak dyotak he
 It indicates that the air of Banaras is not breathable
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin

 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 My villages are still backward today
 unamem se hi ek pichde gaanv jayapur ko pradhanmantri modi ne god liya tha
 i was also happy that one of my villages would be rejuvenated
 ye kushi haqiqat main bhi badalati dikh rahi he vahaan sadake bijli pani ke saath duusari buniyadi suvidhaayen shaharon jaisi ho gai he
 But we tell you the reality of our city, how the city has lost its life due to dusty roads and dust
 agar aap saans ke rogi, dama or asthma se peedit he or in dinon apane pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main aana chaahate hai to sanbhal ke aaen kyonki yahaan kii hawa main ud rahe dhul ke kan or gadiyon ke carbon aap kii beemaari ko badha sakate hai
 And those who do not suffer from these diseases should also be cautious as the Banaras Fiza has been polluted to dangerous levels
 ye bate ham hi nahin pradooshan vibhaag bhi kah rahaa he
 TN Singh of the Pollution Department says that there is a vascular pollution, vehicles coming into the city, excavation has been going on in the city of Benaras for decades, its parts are flying, there is a problem with genset, it also has a great effect It is falling and Menali who is having Vascular Pollution is counting 80 to 85 percent
 banaras kii hawa main ghulte is zehar ke hairaan karne vaale aankade tab saamne aae jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek hafte pehle rashtriya vaayu gunvattta suchakank lagu kiya
 Its indices suggest that the fijas of Banaras are not breathable
 banaras ke ardli bazaar sthit suchakank kaa sensor bataata he ki piem 10 kii maatra kaa ausat 244 micron prati ghan centimetre he
 It recorded a minimum of 110 and a maximum of 427
 jabaki iskaa str 60 micron prati ghan centimetre se kam hona chaiye
 Similarly, dust particles smaller than 10 microns were found to be 7 times more than the standard
 isi kram main piem 2
 The average volume of 5 was 220
 choubees ghante main iskaa nunatam 50 or adhiktam 500 record kiya gaya jabaki isaki maatra 40 se kam honi chaiye
 That is, it is 12 times more than the standard
 hawa main ghule partical kitne khatarnaak hai, is par biechayu ke profesar bi di treepathi kehete hai, 'particulet matter kaa saise jisko kii 100 micron prati ghan centimetre hona chaiye wo 300 se 400 mil rahaa he
 This is a very dangerous sign
 ye indicate karata he ki banaras kii hawa saans lene laayak nahin he
 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 mere gaanv aaj bhi pichde hai
 One of the backward villages, Jayapur, was adopted by Prime Minister Modi
 mujhe bhi khushi hui ki mere ek gaanv kaa kayakalp ho jayega
 This happiness is indeed changing in reality as well, along with rotting seed water, other basic facilities have become like cities
 par ham aapako ye apane shahar kii haqiqat bataate hai ki kaise khastahal sadak or dhul kii vajah se shahar kii zindagi bezaar ho gai he
 If you are suffering from respiratory disease, asthma and asthma and want to come to your Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency these days, then be careful because the dust mites in the air and the carbon of the vehicles can increase your disease
 or jo log in bimariyon se grast nahin hai wo bhi satark rahen kyonki banaras kii fizaa khatarnaak str tak pradooshit ho chuki he
 Not only these things, the pollution department is also saying this
 pradooshan vibhaag ke tii en singh bataate he ki vascular polution he, jo gaadiyaan shahar main aa rahi hai, banaras shahar main dashakon se khudaai chal rahi he, uske jo partical hai wo ud rahe hai, jensett se bahut samasya he, uskaa bhi bahut asar pad rahaa he or menley jo vascular polution he wo 80 se 85 fisadi count kar rahaa he
 Surprising figures of this poison dissolving in the air of Banaras came to light when Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented the National Air Quality Index a week ago
 iske suchakank bataa rahe hai ki banaras kii fijaa saans lene laayak nahin he
 The sensor of the orderly market index of Banaras shows that the average of the quantity of PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter

 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 yani ye maanak se 12 guna adhik he
 On how dangerous the particles dissolved in air, BH Tripathi BD Tripathi says, 'particulate matter size which should be 100 microns per cubic centimeter is getting 300 to 400
 ye bahut khatarnaak dyotak he
 It indicates that the air of Banaras is not breathable
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 TN Singh of the Pollution Department says that there is a vascular pollution, vehicles coming into the city, excavation has been going on in the city of Benaras for decades, its parts are flying, there is a problem with genset, it also has a great effect It is falling and Menali who is having Vascular Pollution is counting 80 to 85 percent
 banaras kii hawa main ghulte is zehar ke hairaan karne vaale aankade tab saamne aae jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek hafte pehle rashtriya vaayu gunvattta suchakank lagu kiya
 Its indices suggest that the fijas of Banaras are not breathable
 banaras ke ardli bazaar sthit suchakank kaa sensor bataata he ki piem 10 kii maatra kaa ausat 244 micron prati ghan centimetre he
 It recorded a minimum of 110 and a maximum of 427
 jabaki iskaa str 60 micron prati ghan centimetre se kam hona chaiye
 Similarly, dust particles smaller than 10 microns were found to be 7 times more than the standard
 isi kram main piem 2
 The average volume of 5 was 220
 choubees ghante main iskaa nunatam 50 or adhiktam 500 record kiya gaya jabaki isaki maatra 40 se kam honi chaiye
 That is, it is 12 times more than the standard
 hawa main ghule partical kitne khatarnaak hai, is par biechayu ke profesar bi di treepathi kehete hai, 'particulet matter kaa saise jisko kii 100 micron prati ghan centimetre hona chaiye wo 300 se 400 mil rahaa he
 This is a very dangerous sign
 ye indicate karata he ki banaras kii hawa saans lene laayak nahin he
 No one knows this, except when i am there, as there is no existence of Shiva
 main shiv ke trishul basii hum yaa sheshnag ke fan par, isapar log baaten karte hai lekin ek vakt tha ki aryavart kaa koi bhi shahar mujhase zyada anushaasit, sabhy or tarakkee vaala nahin tha
 But today there is a lot of population pressure in my narrow streets
 gadiyon kaa aana janaa bhi bahut he
 According to a rough estimate, there are about 11 lakh scooters and motor cycles
 1 lakh se upar car or jeep hai, tractor 5300 hazaar he to trailor 10 hazaar
 Similarly, there are trucks and buses whose diseases are increasing due to smoke
 aajkal ke dhanvantari bataate hai ki in dinon saans or or dame ke marij mere shahar main bahut bad gaye hai
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness

 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here
 is
 yahi haul polister, nylon, coton, marsraiced, viscorse, jaise desh main banane vaale dhaagon kaa he
 The weaver from whose debt is never able to recover
 modi ji se unhen ummid jaagi thi lekin haath maayusi hi lagi
 According to a 2007 survey in Banaras, there were about 5255 small large units
 isame sari broked, zaradozi, zari metal, gulabiminakaari, kundankaree, jewelri, pathar kii kataai, glass painting, beeds, dari, karpet, wal hanging, mukut work jaise chote manzole udyog the
 About 20 lakh people used to work in these and this business was 7500 crores
 lekin iname 2257 ikai puri tarah band ho chuki hai or baaki bachi bhi band hone ke kagaar par hai
 But after the coming of the Modi government and emphasizing his Make in India and Skill Development, his talk had brought great expectations to the people associated with these industries
 par bajet main inke liye koi thos upaay na hone kii vajah se ye log behad niraash hai
 The same is true of the wooden toy industry
 apni taraf barabas khinchate ye khilone agar bol sakate to apane gadhane vaale kii bebasii zarur bayaan karte
 The lifeless sticks roaming fast in the Kashmiri street of Banaras, the way the colors become pleasant by covering themselves with color, they have been carrying the whole world in their own beauty
 kuch samay pehle tak ye kaarobaar apane charam par tha
 Their toys were exported abroad
 karodon kaa kaarobaar hota tha
 But the government suddenly banned the use of Koi-riya's wood from which these beautiful toys took shape
 maje kii baat ye ki is lakdi kaa jiskaa kisi duusari cheez main istemaal bhi nahin hota
 Despite this, it was banned
 is faisle ke baad se hi khilone se chamak gaayab ho gai
 The toys that had been giving young children for centuries suddenly started showing enemies
 is sarkaar se inhen bahut ummid thi lekin duusari sarkaron kii tarah yahaan bhi inhe niraashaa hi haath lagi
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
 jaise shiv ke astitv kaa koi aadi nahin he vaise hi main kab se hum, ye mere sivaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 Whether i live on Shiva's trident or on Sheshnag's fun, people talk about it, but there was a time that no city of Aryavarta was more disciplined, civilized and progressing than me
 lekin aaj meri sankari galiyon main aabaadi kaa dabaav bahut he
 There is also a lot of vehicles coming and going
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq taqariban 11 lakh scooter or motor cycle he
 There are cars and jeeps above 1 lakh, tractor is 5300 thousand then trailer is 10 thousand
 isi tarah trek or based hai jinke dhuon se bimaariyaan bad rahi hai
 Today's Dhanwantari says that these days, patients with breathlessness and asthma have increased a lot in my city
 in sabake bich siver kii samasya kodh main khaaj he
 The pipeline is broken in place
 unka pani sadakon par he
 Sewer water is also found in the supply of water in the houses, which people are forced to drink
 ye badahaali sirf khastahal, dhul bhari sadak or siver kii hi nahin he
 Rather, while passing through the street of Thatheri Bazar of our own courtyard, narrated the story of more than two dozen arts like chisel hammer sound, cow slang, Mughal fallacy, Bengali nakhas, gadi work, utensil work, takka work
 Used to do lekin aaj yahaan sannata he
 The same situation is with the weavers
 banarsi sari kaa kaarobaar taqariban 1 hazaar karod kaa he jisamen 300 se 400 karod kaa har saal export hota he
 Sometimes this figure was many times more
 kyonki tab isse jude ro material banaras or desh ke kai hisson main hi banataa tha
 But today the condition is that yarn has started coming from China
 is par badi vidmbana ye he ki kachche maal chinis yarn par to sarkaar 25 fisadi tex laga rahi he jabaki isi dhaage se bane taiyaar maal jo china se aa rahaa he us par sirf 10 fisadi tex laga rahi he jo yahaan ke udyog ko khatm kar rahaa he
 This hall is of yarns made in the country like polyester, nylon, cotton, mercerized, viscose
 jiske karj se bunakar kabhi ubar nahin paata
 He had aroused hope from Modi ji, but he felt disappointed
 banaras main 2007 ke survey ke mutabiq takreeban 5255 choti badi ikai thi
 There were small medium industries such as saree brocade, zardozi, zari metal, pink minting, kundankari, jewelery, stone cutting, glass painting, beads, carpets, carpets, wall hanging, crown work
 inamen taqariban 20 lakh log kaam karte the or ye kaarobaar 7500 karod kaa tha
 But the 2257 unit has been completely closed and the remaining are on the verge of closure
 lekin modi sarkaar aane ke baad or unke mek in india or skill development par jor detii unki baton ne in udyogon se jude logon ko badi ummiden dilaai thi
 But these people are very disappointed due to no concrete measures for them in the budget
 yahi haal lakdi ke khilone ke udyog kaa he
 If you could say these toys while pulling them, then you would definitely tell your builder's helplessness
 banaras ke kashmiri gali main teji se gumti ye bejaan lakadiyaan jis tarah rangon ko apane par odh kar khushnuma banati hai vaise hi ye puri duniya ko apni khubsuurati se apane bas main karti rahi hai
 Until some time ago, this business was at its peak
 inke banaae khilone videshon main niryaat hote the
 There was a business of crores
 lekin sarkaar ne achaanak koi-raiya kii us lakdi ke istemaal par roak laga diya jisase ye khubasurat khilone aakaar lete the
 The interesting thing is that this wood which is not used in anything else
 baavjood iske is par roak laga di gai
 The glow disappeared from the toy only after this decision
 sadiyon se jo khilone bacchon ko jawan karte aae the achaanak wo dushman nazar aane lage
 He expected a lot from this government, but like other governments, he too got frustrated
 ganga or uske ghaaton kii vyathaa katha kya kahuun
 i do not want to tell him because you all know him
 uske dard ko dekh kar har kisi ko ronaa aata he
 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 In the midst of all this, the problem of sewer is leprous
 jagah-jagah pipe line toote he
 Their water is on the roads
 gharon main jo pani kii supplai he usamen bhi siver kaa pani mil jaataa he jise log pine ke liye majboor hai
 This misery is not just about the ravaged, dusty road and sewer
 balki hamaare apane angan ke thatheri bazaar kii gali main kabhi guzarate vaqt chheni hathaudi si nikalne vaali awaz, gop kii binawat, mogul parataji, bengali nakhaas, gadhaai kaa kaam, bartan kaa kaam, tabak ke kaam jaise do darjan se zyada kalaon kii daastaan sunaaya karti thi
 But today there is silence here
 yahi haal bunakaron kaa he
 The business of Banarasi sarees is about 1 thousand crores with exports of 300 to 400 crores every year
 kabhi ye aankada isse kai guna zyaada tha
 Because then the raw material associated with it was made only in Benaras and many parts of the country
 lekin aaj haalat ye he ki china se yarn aane laga he
 The big irony on this is that the government is levying 25 per cent tax on raw material Chinese yarn, while the finished goods made from this yarn which are coming from China are only taxing 10 per cent which is destroying the industry here

 At these ghats, the son of our own courtyard Nazir Banarsi wrote for the Ganges, 'the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes to me, the Ganges comes, repeating the rumors The Ganges ' ganga dashakon se apni badahaali ke afsaane duhara rahi he
 But there is no one to listen to him
 narendra jab uski dahalij par aaye the to ganga ko hi dekh kar kaha tha kii mujhe to maa ne hi bulaayaa he
 Mother also felt that there was some son who was feeling his pain
 namaami gange yojana bani to uski ye ichha or balwati hui par ek saal guzar gaya
 During this time only the deposits of eighty ghats were removed
 baaki sab jas kaa tas he
 Due to lack of drainage of the Ganga sand due to the Kachuva Century, the ghats have become such that many ghats will be destroyed in a decade
 ye aisa sach he jisase samay rahete nahin cheta gaya to parinaam ghaatak hi honge
 Seeing this pain of mother Ganga, one line of Mahakavi Nirala remembers that 'sorrow is the story of life, what to say, what i have not said till date
 'tippaniyan It is not that Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not know about our plight
 unhen bakhubi maaloom he or iske liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi hui
 But after the Shilanyas and the announcement there are many plans waiting for the beginning
 iname pramukh hai BHU main 600 karod kii teachers training centre yojana jiskaa shilnyas pradhanmantri ne kiya tha
 500 crore diesel rail engine expansion plan
 250 karod main banaras kaint railway stesan ke remodeling kii yojana jisamen sirf saansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai
 900 crore underground cable scheme
 hryday yojana ke tahat 90 karod kii yojana ke saath ghaaton kii safai kii yojana abhi apane shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he tab tak kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18 hazaar karod rupee kii yojana kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 These are the new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu
 puraane vaade abhi jameen par dikhaai nahin pad rahe or sarkaar kaa ek saal biit gaya par abhi main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki aakhir kab hamaari surat badalegi
 We are not hopeless
 ham abhi bhi ummid ke naav par savaar hai ki badahaali ke is majdhaar se khushhaali kaa kinaaraa zarur aayega
 What to tell the agony story of Ganga and its ghats
 use kehane kaa ji nahin chahta kyonki use to aap sab jaanate hi hai
 Seeing his pain, everyone cries
 kabhi inhen ghaaton par hamaare apane angan ke sapoot nazir banarsi ne ganga ke liye likhaa tha, 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga
 'ganga has been reiterating its plight for decades
 par uski sunne vaala koi nahin
 When Narendra came to his doorstep, looking at the Ganges, he said that my mother had called me
 maa bhi laga kii koi to sapoot aayaa jo uske dard ko mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Namami Gange made a plan, but his desire was strengthened but a year passed
 is darmiyaan sirf assi ghat kii jamaa mitti hi hati
 Everything else remains the same
 kachuva centuri kii vajah se ganga ke baaluu kii nikasi na hone se ghat kaa kataan aisa ho gaya he ki ek dashak baad kabhi bhi kai ghat jameendos ho jaaenge
 This is the truth that if the time is not warned, the consequences will be fatal
 maa ganga ke is dard ko dekh kar mahakavi niraala kii ek pankti yaad aati he ki 'dukh hi jivan kii katha rahi kya kahuun aaj tak jo nahin kahi
 Comments aisa nahin kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hamaari is badahaali kaa pataa nahin
 He is well aware and plans for this have also been announced
 par shilnyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat ke intazaar main kai yojanaayen hai
 Prominent among them are the 600 crore Teachers Training Center Scheme which was laid by the Prime Minister
 500 karod kii dijal rail ingine vistarikaran kii yojana
 250 crore for the remodeling of Banaras Cantt railway station, with 36 lakhs from MP fund only
 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 With the plan of 90 crores under the heart plan, the plan of cleaning the ghats is still waiting for its start till then Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu dreamed of a plan of Rs 18 thousand crores
 venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane hai
 The old promises are not visible on the ground right now and a year has passed since the government, but now i am waiting for when our appearance will change
 ham noummid nahin hai
 We are still on the boat of hope that this midstream of the bad will definitely bring the edge of happiness
