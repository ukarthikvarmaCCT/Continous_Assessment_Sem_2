 Milan Vaishnav, senior fellow of Washington-based Carnegie Advance for International Peace, who has researched India's political economy, believes that the time has come for female voters, "for the first time in history, we are seeing the difference between gender and gender

 These are the ones you can convince to get into your court

 "ve ahm kyon hai?bhartiya mahila matadaataaon kii ahmiyat kii jhalak tamaam partiyon kii siyaasi laffaaji or ranneeti main bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 The Prime Minister's emphasis on all flag-bearer schemes — whether it is Ujjwala or the sanitation campaign to build toilets or ASHA workers (centered around mental health) — is on women and they are benefiting the most

 The difference in male and female voters' turnout of votes is rapidly disappearing and has come down to the lowest level
 lihaaja pehle jahaan har 10 purush matadaataaon par teen auraten vot dene aati thim, ab unki taadaad badhkar har 10 purushon par saat mahila matadaata ho gai he
 Women's participation reached its highest level in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections (65
 63 fisadi yaa 26 karod mahilaon ne vot daale)
 In the 2014 general election, the difference between female and male voters had come down to 2 per cent
 hakeekat yah he ki tamilnadu, nagaland or sikkim ke kai jilon main stri-purush fark puri tarah mit gaya he
 In some districts of these states, more number of women are voting than men

 Only 43 percent of the men came to vote
 karnataka main 2018 main matadaata soochiyon main sanshodhan ke baad mahila matadaataaon kii taadaad main 13 fisadi kaa ijapha hua
 The environment of change: Keeping these figures in mind, all political parties are setting their political messages and propaganda strategies to woo women voters, because there is now enough practical evidence that women voters can tilt the electoral edge to one side or the other
 Huh
 congress ne disambar, 2018 main rajasthan ke karauli main takreeban 40,000 auraton ke bich ek survey karavaaya tha taaki unke vot daalane ke taur-tareekon ko samajha ja sake
 The survey asked him about the information he received and his likes and dislikes (to find out if he had different opinions from his peers, brothers and fathers)
 nattejey chankane vaale the—survey main shaamil takreeban 75 fisadi auraton ne kaha ki ve apane aadamiyon se ahalada or swatantra jaankaree hasil karti hai or apana siyaasi vikalp bhi swatantra dhang se chunati hai
 This was in stark contrast to their responses in 2009 (after the 2008 assembly election), when most of them said that they also voted for the same candidate their family had voted for
 karauli main sakshartaa kii dar ittefacan rashtriya ausat se kam he or ise aviksit jile ke khaane main rakhaa gaya he
 Much of this has to do with the accessibility of information and information
 tamaam saamaajik tabakon main kul milakar aaj ek arab se zyada mobile conection hai
 In such a situation, it has become easier than ever before to get information and women are using these information with full fervor
 congress party ke data analytics vibhaag ke chairman praveen chakravarti bataate hai ki 'ghar-parivaar kaa vot' kii avadharana sir ke bal ulat gai he
 He says, "I understand that there can now be four different votes in a household
 2019 main soochna or jaankaree kaa chunaav hoga
 There has been a dramatic change in the way political parties view elections
 "brookings india main research kii diarector shamika ravi ek adhyayan kaa hawala detii hai jo unhone 2005 main bihar ke vidhansabha chunaav par kiya tha
 When no one won the elections held in February, President's rule was imposed, and eight months later in october-november, elections were held again
 ravi ne 243 nirvachan kshetron ke chunavi nateezon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jisase pataa chalaa ki 87 nirvachan kshetron main jeetne vaali party badal gai
 In other words, 36 percent of the previous winners were dusted off by voters
 ''isi ke saath rajd kii 15 saal kii hukumat kaa ant ho gaya or jad (you) sabase badi party ke taur par ubharkar aayaa
 There were no new policies in these eight months
 lihaaja, nateezon main aae is badlaav ko bihar ke chunaav main mahila matadaataaon kii maujuudagi se samajha ja saktaa he
 The women came out in large numbers to vote and for the second time they voted against the previous winners
 "chunaav ke baad mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalane vaale nitish kumaar ne ise fouran pahchaan liya or ve ''mahila matadaataaon kii pasand-naapsand ke prati bahut samvedansheel rahe hai or uske hisaab se kadam uthaate rahe hai
 "since then, many schemes in the state, from liquor ban to bicycle, show that they recognize and recognize the strength of this 'vote bank'
 ravi apane adhyayan kaa ek or pahalu saamne rakhti hai—nateezon se is baat kaa bhi ishaara mila ki vot dene vaali mahila matadaataaon kii taadaad main oochaal kii badaulat ek party ke dobaaraa chunakar aane kii sambhaavnaaen ghat gayi jabaki purush matadaataaon kii taadaad main badhotaree ke chalate uske dobaaraa chunakar aane kii sambhaavna main ijapha hua
 When women vote in their own will and freely, they show that their interests are different from the rest of the society
 yah us vakt se bilkul alag he jab sabake liye matadhikaar par bahasein kii jaati thim, jab 19veen sadi ke rajnatik siddhantkaar or arthshaastri james miller ne kaha tha ki jan-pratinidhitiv pranali ke kharchon ko kam rakhane kii khatir auraton ko alag se matdaan kaa adhikaar dene kii jarurat nahin he kyonki unke hit unke shauharon or pitaaon ke hiton main hi shaamil hai
 To the extent that the BJP was traditionally accepted among men, it wooed women voters to a lesser extent
 india today ke haath lage party ke ek dastavej ke mutabik 2014 ke chunaav ke baad karwaae gaye survey main party ne paaya ki 33 fisadi purushon or 29 fisadi mahilaon ne bhaajapa ko vot diya tha
 Now come in 2017, when a research paper of the party revealed that it has achieved a big lead among women voters in Haryana, Odisha and West Bengal, while it has only marginally increased the number of male voters
 2018 main chunaav se pehle is baar madhya pradesh or rajasthan main karwaae gaye party ke ek andruni survey se pataa chalaa ki mahila matadaataaon ke bich uski lokapriyata main thodaa-sa ijapha hua he or 2014-18 ke bich yah 29 fisadi se badhkar 31 fisadi par pahunch gai he
 According to a big party strategist, it was the 'macho bachelor' (masculine bachelor) image of Prime Minister Modi that was now wooing him
 siyasat main kadam rakhane ke baad se hi auraten modi ke liye pramukh or ahm matadaata samooh rahi hai
 She has always projected herself as an 'axis', especially among rural women
 modi par najar rakhane vaale gujarat ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad bhi, jab unke satta main lautne par bada sawalia nishaan laga tha, unhone mahilaon ke samarthan par bharosa kiya tha, jo apane bacchon ko aashirwad dilwane ke liye aksar unke paas aayaa karti thim
 It was this image that inspired Modi to see women as his core constituency
 dobaaraa mukhyamantri kii gaddi sanbhaalane ke baad unhone mahilaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kai faisle kiye
 The lack of separate toilets for girls was a major reason why parents did not send their daughters to school
 ye mudde unhone 2014 ke chunaav main bhi uthaae or ye unke prachaar abhiyaan ke centre main bhi the
 The last five years witnessed many such schemes whose emphasis was on making the lives of women a little easier
 ujjwala gas kit, sarkari mahila karmchaaree ke liye maatrutiv avkaash ke dinon main badhotaree, garbhvatee or doodh pilaane vaali maataaon ko 6,000 ru
 Allowance, even Swachh Bharat Yojana — all these were attempts to connect female voters with them

 The impact of clean India and open defecation will also be affected because diarrhea is the leading cause of death of children in the poorest states of the country

 " party ne kai survey kiye hai jinase pataa chalata he ki mahila matadaata ko ghisi-pity baton or surkhiyon se rijhaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 The results in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra revealed that women voters are angry with the ban on demonetisation, and in particular cow slaughter (here concerns about the livelihood of their sons and husbands and stray animals trampling their fields)
 sambhaavna yah bhi he ki auraten khud apane yaa apane bacchon ke liye naukari or rojgaar ke avasaron ke mudde par vot den
 Security and safety are his second highest concerns
 2019 kaa chunaav ek aisa chunaav ho saktaa he jisamen rajnatik vimarsh ke saath hissedari ke niyam-kaayade or takaaje bhi badal jaaen
 Women will come out to vote in large numbers, so they will demand more accountability and more likely to vote for development instead of caste and identity
 agar aisa hota he, to yah desh ke liye acha hi hoga

 mananeey adhyaksh mahodaya, yadhyapi mujhe padbhaar grahan kiye hue mushkil se ek maheenaa hua he, mere paas mananeey sansad sadasyon, sarkaar main mere sahyogiyon, rajyon, steke holderon, sanghathanon or desh ke vibhinn konon se nai gadiyon, nai rail linon or behatar suvidhaon ke liye anurodhon or sujhaavon kii baadh-si aa gai he
 i know that everyone feels that they have solutions to all the challenges that Indian Railways are facing, i had such a belief even before i became aware of the huge complexities and problems of this huge organization
 ab main rail mantri ke rup main in apekshaaon ko puraa karne main apni badi jimmedaariyon se abhibhoot hum
 Madam Speaker, i remember the following words of Kautilya: Prajasukhe Sukham Ragna: Prajananch Hite Hitam
 natmapriyan hitan rajya: prajanaa tu priyan hitam
 The happiness of the public lies in the happiness of the people unka kalyaan uskaa kalyaan hota he The thing that makes the ruler happy will not be considered good, but the person is happy with whatever the public is happy about
 - kautilya kaa arthshaastra Indian Railways carries over 23 million passengers in 12617 trains daily, connecting more than 7172 stations of this subcontinent
 yah pratidin australia kii sampurna jansankhya ko dhone ke baraabar he
 We carry around 3 million tonnes of goods per day in over 7421 freight trains
 adhyaksh mahodaya, ek billian ton maal yatayaat se adhik ladaan kar china, rus or sanyukt rajya america kii relon ke select club main bhartiya rail ko pravesh karne kii uplabdhi hasil he, ab meraa lakshya vishwa main sabase agrani vaahak ke rup main ubharne kaa he
 Madam Speaker, in addition to carrying passengers, as you know, Indian Railways also carries coal
 yah steel kii dhulaai karti he yah cement kii dhulaai karti he yah namak kii dhulaai karti he yah khadyannon or chaare kii dhulaai karti haior yah doodh kii bhi dhulaai karti he Thus, the Indian Railways handles practically all and does not carry any goods, provided it can be carried in the wagon
 sabase mahatvapurn he ki ham raksha sanghathan kii aapurti shrinkhalaa kii ridh banakar raashtra kii suraksha main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Madam Speaker, although we carry 23 million passengers per day, but there are still many people who have not yet stepped on the train
 ham audyogic samoohon ko pattanon or khadaanon se jodate hue prativarsh ek billian ton se adhik maal yatayaat kaa ladaan karte hai lekin abhi bhi kai andruni bhaag rail sampark kii pratiksha kar rahe hai
 Although freight traffic trade has been steadily increasing over the years, Indian Railways carry only 31 per cent of the total freight traffic in the country by all means
 ye aisi chunautiyaan he jinka hamen saamana karnaa he
 It is expected to earn income as a commercial enterprise from such a large organization which has a wide variety of responsibilities and also function as a welfare organization
 ye do kaary, railpath kii do patariyon ke samaan hai, jo haalanki saath-saath chalati hai lekin kabhi milti nahin hai
 Till now, Indian Railways has been carrying on this difficult task, balancing these two conflicting objectives
 2000-01 main saamaajik seva-daayitv, sakal yatayaat praptiyon ke 9
 4 percent increase to 16 in 2010-11
 6 pratishat ho gaya
 20,000 crore in 2012-13
 se bhi adhik ho gaya
 The total investment for this year ie, plan outlay under budgetary sources is Rs
 35,241 crore
 tha
 Thus the burden of social obligation is more than half of our plan outlay under budgetary sources
 adhyaksh mahodaya, saamaajik dayitvon par bajtiy sroton ke antargat apane yojana parivyay ke aadhi se zyada raashi kharch karne vaala koi bhi sanghathan apane vikaas kaaryon ke liye mushkil se hi paryaapt sansaadhan juta saktaa he
 However, Chairman, Indian Railways will continue to fulfill its social obligations but it is not possible to balance these two conflicting objectives beyond a limit without compromising on efficiency and safety of train operations
 hamaare paas 1
 16 lakh km
 lambaai kaa kul railpath, 63,870 sawari dibbe, 2
 More than 4 lakh goods coaches and 13
 1 lakh karmchaaree hai
 This requires spending on fuel pay and pension, track and coach compartment maintenance and even more importantly safety related work
 in kaaryon par safala yatayaat aamadani se hone vaali hamaari adhikansh arya kharch ho jaati he
 The gross traffic revenue in the year 2013-14 was Rs
 1,39,558 crores and the total operations were Rs
 1,30,321 crores, with an operating ratio of about 94 percent
 adhyaksh mahodaya, isse pataa chalata he ki arjeet kiye gayi prayek rupaye main se ham 94 paisa parichaalan par kharch kar dete hai
 We have only six paisa as surplus
 yah raashi kam hone ke alaava kiraayon main sanshodhan na kiye jane ke kaaran isamen nirantar giravat ai he
 This surplus was Rs 11,754 crore in the year 2007-08 after payment of mandatory dividend and lease charges and is estimated to be Rs 602 crore in the current year
 adhyaksh mahodaya, relon dwaara is prakaar jutaaye gayi is bahut hi kam adhishesh dwaara sangrakshan, kshamta badhaane, avasangrakshan, yatri sevaaon or sukh-suvidhaon ko behatar banane ke liye kaaryon ko vittposhit kiya jaataa he
 5 lakh crore rupees is required only for the ongoing projects i
e
 around 50,000 crore rupees per year
 isse apekshit rashit adhishesh ke rup main uplabdh raashi ke bich baari antar aa jaataa he
 Although prudent efforts should have been made to bridge this gap, but the tariff policy adopted lacked a rational approach
 yatri kiraayon ko laagat se kam rakhaa gaya or is prakaar paisanger gaadi ke parichaalan main haani hui
 This loss continued to increase which increased by 10 paise per passenger kilometer from 2000-01 to 23 paise in 2012-13 as passenger fares were always kept low
 duusari ore malbhaadaa daron ko samay-samay par badhaayaa or unhen zyada rakhaa gaya taaki paisanger sector main hone vaali haani kii pratipurti kii ja sake
 As a result, the freight traffic continued to be released from the railways
 vigat 30 varshon main kul maal yatayaat main railway kaa hissaa nirantar kam hua he
 Madam Speaker, it is noteworthy that the reduction of railway share in total freight traffic is like loss of revenue
 adhyaksh mahodaya, yah bataane ke baad ki kis prakaar rajasav ko ganvaaya gaya ab main yah bataanaa chahta hum ki kis prakaar nivesh main dishaheenata he
 Instead of insisting on completing projects, the focus was on getting them approved
 pichley 30 varshon ke dauraan 1,57,883 karod rupe mulya kii kul 676 pariyojnaayen sweekrut kii gayi, inamen se keval 317 pariyojnaon ko hi puraa kiya ja sakaa or shesh 359 pariyojnaon ko puraa kiya janaa baaki he, jinhen puraa karne ke liye ab 1,82,000 karod rupe apekshit honge
 In the last 10 years 99 new line projects worth Rs 60,000 crore have been approved, out of which only one project has been completed till date
 vastav main isamen 4 pariyojnaayen to aisi hai jo 30 varsh tak puraani hai parantu ve kisi na kisi kaaran se abhi tak puri nahin hui hai
 The more projects we add to this, the less resources we will be able to provide for them and the more time it will take to complete them
 yadi yahi pravati jari rakhi gayi to main nishchit taur par kah saktaa hum ki or adhik hajaaron karod rupe kharch ho jaaenge or isse mushkil se hi koi pratifal praapt hoga
 Madam Speaker, now after mentioning the never ending projects of Indian Railways, let me now mention how the priority is given in selecting the projects
 ati santrupt network main bheedbhad ko kam karne ke liye doharikaran or tiharikaran ke liye kiye jane vaale nivesh se relon ko dhan praapt hota he
 On the other hand, the construction of new lines mostly does not fully meet the operational cost as there is no corresponding demand
 pichley 10 varshon main bhartiya rail ne 3738 kilometre nai linon ko bichaane ke liye 41,000 karod rupe kaa nivesh kiya he
 On the other hand it spent only Rs 18,400 crore for doubling 5050 km
 yadpi pranali ko sudrudh banane ke liye yah praathamikta vaala kaary tha
 Incidentally, i would like to quote the following thing said by a person about Indian Railways
 main ise tab tak nahin samaj paaya jab tak mujhe in tathyon kii jaankaree nahin thi, jinka maine abhi tak zikr kiya he
 This statement is as follows: ‘’aapane aise kisi vyapaar ke bare main nahin suna hoga, jiskaa ekadhikaar ho,jiskaa graahak aadhaar lagbhag 125 karod ho,jisaki 100 pratishat bikri agrim bhugtan par hoti ho,or uske baavjood uske paas dhan kaa abhaav ho
 "president, Madam, this has been the story of Indian Railways till now
 adhyaksh mahodaya, railway dwaara saamaajik daayitv kaa nirvahan karnaa koi mudda nahin he
 But in the name of social need, public-pleasing projects have been selected, from which the Railways have hardly received any revenue
 saamaajik daayitv ke naam par alaabhprad pariyojnaon par nivesh kiya janaa jari rahaa
 Overall, for many years neither did the Railways get any returns from these projects nor did it fully fulfill its social responsibility
 is trutipurna prabandhan or udaseenta se bahut varshon se railway dhan kii baari tangi kaa saamana kar rahi he, ‘jo svarnim duvidha ke dashak’- vanijyik vyavhaaryata or saamaajik vyavhaaryata ke bich chayan kii duvidha kaa parinaam he
 Madam Speaker, i know that my erstwhile Honorable Ministers were also aware of this state of uncertainty but they could not abandon the 'intoxication' they get from hearing applause in the House while announcing these projects
 adhyaksh mahodaya, kuch nai pariyojnaon kii ghoshnaa karke main bhi is sammanit sadan se taaliyaan paa saktaa hum parantu yah kathin sthiti se guzar rahe is sanghathan ke prati anyaay karnaa hoga
 i wish that i could get applause throughout the year by improving the condition of the railways
 bhartiya rail kii is shochaneey sthiti ko tatkaal thik kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some of the corrective measures that i have planned include revising the fares
 yah ek kathin parantu jaruri nirnay tha
 Madam Speaker, as said yattadagre vishmiv pariname amritopamam
 "it feels bitter to eat medicine but it results in sweet" is kiraaya sanshodhan se bhartiya rail ko lagbhag 8000 karod rupe kaa atirikt rajasav praapt hoga
 However, to complete the Golden Quadrilateral network, we need more than Rs 9 lakh crore and to run only one bullet car is about Rs 60,000 crore
 adhyaksh mahodaya, kya yah uchit hoga ki in nidhiyon kii vyavastha karne ke liye kiraayon or maal-haada kii daron main vruddhi kii jaae or uskaa boj janata par daalaa jaae
 Since this is unrealistic, i will have to think of alternative remedies for arranging these funds

 With the death of 556 leopards in a decade in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, it can be said that there is a dangerous destruction of leopards here and this speckled unrivaled creature is now moving towards extinction by slow but strict steps

 And this is the official figure
 gaiyrsarkari aankadon ke anusaar is avadhi main 67 tendue maare ja chuke hai, yani har maah kam se kam 11 tenduon kii maut hui he
 The shrinking forests and increasing scarcity of prey have forced the bewildered leopards to leave the forest and wreak havoc on human settlements
 tendue pichley ek dashak main 200 logon kii jaan le chuke hai or 356 logon ko jhinzod chuke hai
 Obviously, both humans and animals are fighting a decisive battle to save their lives and breed
 yah aam baat he ki jin graminon ke apane bhai-bandhu yaa maveshi tenduon ke shikaar banate hai, ve badla lene ke liye tenduon ko maar daalate hai
 The record is more than any other state in the country, that in the last nine years, the Forest Department has issued 75 permits to kill leopards, terming them as man-eaters
 yah tay karne kaa koi tarika nahin he ki vaastavik aadamkhor tendua maaraa ja rahaa he yaa koi nirdosh tendua, lekin unhen maarane ke permit rajnatik dabaav main jari kiye ja rahe hai
 In addition to cases of hesitation and injuries, an average of 25 people are being killed by leopards and now the villagers of Utu, after taking revenge on the sleepless leopards, have trapped them in nets to get them released

 On the other hand, additional Chief Forest Conservation Officer of Uttarakhand Forest Department Shrikant Chandaula says that the development of a separate Uttarakhand state has intensified the development activities here, increasing the human population across the state, due to which leopards and humans face to face
 Incidents have increased and so has the conflict
 chandaula kaa nishkarsh he, ‘insaan-jaanwaron ke sah-astitv kaa silsilaa bilkul nahin chal paa rahaa he

 Not only this, under the pressure of population, not only the safe habitat of leopards has become smaller, but their main diet - vegetarian animals are also dying
 tenduon ke sankat par lambey samay se kaam karte aa rahe mukhya van sangrakshan adhikari pi
 Singh says, "the lack of animals hunted by leopards has forced them to directly enter human settlements and attack children, women, cattle and even chickens
" ’is par prabhavit graminon kii taraf se javaabi hamale hote hai jisase tenduon ke marane kii dar bad jaati he
 In order to protect themselves from leopards, villagers set up traps, which often kill them

 On the occasion of Independence Day, every person thinks whether he is truly free or not
 students bhi isse alag nahin he
 From time to time, students organize agitations and protests from jantar-mantar to some other places for some of their demands
 jaaniye students apane liye skool or collejon main kisi aazaadee chaahate hai
 For this, we have talked to some students, who believe that if they had been given this freedom, then today they could have done more in their lives
 students ko chahie in 7 baton se aazaadee
 
 
 
 
 1
 mayank bataate hai ki ve sainik skool main padhanaa chaahate the
 He was also admitted
 lekin har din apane seniors se peetane ke kaaran unhone tang aakar skool chhod diya
 He says that his school was converted into an army camp
 jahaan unhen kisi baat kii aazaadee nahin thi
 According to him, the childhood of children in such schools is ended
 unki maang he ki in skulon main seniors kii dabangai ko khatm kiya jaae
 2
 rohit jo abhi patrakarita ke peshey main hai ve bataate hai ki aaj bhi wo ladakiyon se baat karne main jhijakte hai
 The reason behind his hesitation is that there was a kind of ban on talking to girls in his school
 yah pabandi itani sakht thi ki aaj tak uskaa asar un par he
 They want that teachers in schools in India should be gender sensitive and should not impose such prohibition
 skulon main ek aaazaad kism kaa mouhaal hona chahie
 3
 dilli uniwarsity main padhane vaale vishnu kehete hai ki skool main ek niyam bana hua tha ki aapako prarthana se pehle skool pahunchnaa he or prathana kerani he
 He says that he did not like it
 unki maang he ki aazaadee kaa khyaal karte hue prathana karnaa or na karnaa students par chhod diya jaae
 4
 computer oparator sapana kaa maananaa he ki skool main kai tarah kii bogus kitaabi baaten padhai jaati he, jinka practical life main koi matlab nahin hota
 They need freedom from such bogus talks
 5
 College students Rajesh says that it is stupid to say that getting an easy education loan in this country
 sachai yah he ki yahaan kaaphi juute ghisane ke baad lone miltaa he
 They want that students should have the freedom to take loans according to the expenses of the course
 6
 Pushpalata, who is preparing for SSC, says that it was not written in his college that jeans were banned, but wearing jeans in college was like breaking the rules and some teachers strongly opposed it
 vah chaahati hai ki aise dakiyanoosee soch vaale teachers par karrwai karke students ko in dakiyanoosee chizon se aazaadee dilaai jaae
 7
 biechayu main padhane vaale jitendra bataate hai ki collejon main kai aise shikshak hote hai jo padhaane main bilkul achche nahin hote
 They ruin the future of hundreds of students

 anantnag main jo begunaah maare gaye
 What should i give their weeds? What to say Some Muslims killed 7 Hindus and injured 19
 nahin katai nahin
 
 
 Looking at the Hindu Muslim's glasses, you will know that Havan was an Ismail who came from the other side of the border and the angel was Salim who was our own
 jisane apni jaan par khelkar 50 se zyaada shraddhaluon ko bachaaya or yaad rahe ki maarane vaale se bachaane vaala hameshaa bada hota he
 During the terrorist attack on the pilgrims who went on the Amarnath Yatra in Anantnag, people saw one such rescuer
 naam he saleem shaikh
 Salim is the driver of a bus that was attacked by terrorists on Monday night
 lekin andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaar ke bich saleem ne apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bagair jis tarah se bas main baithe shraddhaluon kii jaan bachaane kii koshish kii, us par kisi ko bhi naaz ho saktaa he
 But behind the barrage of indiscriminate bullets, the infamous terrorist whose hand is called Abu Ismail
 lashkar commander ismail ne hi amarnath yatriyon par hamale kii puri karatuut ko anjaam diya tha
 The terrorists who fired indiscriminate fire at the innocent devotees of Amarnath were also Muslims to say, but what is the real meaning of Islam and Muslims, it was found that one came from Valsad, Gujarat, two thousand kilometers from Anantnag, at the place of this terrorist attack
 Because of another Muslim
 ye ek ittefaq hi tha ki haathon main bandook liye jo aatankwaadi hindu shraddhaluon kii bas par goliyaan chalaa rahe the, us bas ko chalaane vaala ek musalmaan hi tha, saleem shaikh
 In contrast to the terrorists' thinking and dirty zealots, Salim knew the true meaning of Islam and being a Muslim
 or tabhi is aatankwaadi hamale ke dauraan usne wo kaam kiya, jo kisi bhi insaan kaa farj tha
 He himself did not care for his life and in the midst of a volley of bullets, he continued to ride his bus with full courage and frenzy, and during the attack the tire tire was punctured once again
 lekin saleem shaikh ne bas nahin roki or qareeb dedh kilometre tak tab tak apni bas daudata rahaa, jab tak wo aatankwaadiyon kii pahunch se baahar nahin nikal gaye
 After this, he telephoned in his house and informed them about his well being, and also said that he should not run television at all, so that other people in the house and especially the sick people would be tensed
 kehane kii zarurat nahin he ki agar somvaar ko saleem ne aatankwaadiyon ke saamne apni jidaari kaa muzahiraa nahin kiya hota, to aaj shaayad is hamale main maranevaalon kii taadaad kahin or bhi zyaada hoti
 But between the bullets moving from the front, he kept on walking the bus with his head bowed
 or namaaloom kitne or logon kii zindagi bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 The bus driver Salim's house is a strange environment in Valsad, Gujarat, away from Jammu and Kashmir
 ek taraf to unhen is baat sukun or garv he ki unka apana saleem is hamale main naa sirf salaamat batch gaya, balki usne apni bas bhaga kar dusron kii zindagi bachaane kii bhi koshish kii
 But for those who died in this attack, there is an untold yearning in the heart of this family as well
 shaayad tabhi saleem ke bahaduree kaa kissa bataane kii shuruyaat uski maa khud ko muskuraati hui karti he, lekin jawaab dete-dete aage unka galaa rundh jaataa he or wo rone lagati hai
 On the other hand, just like Salim's mother, many mothers and sisters lying on the hospital bed are also praying for Salim
 sachmuch agar hamale ke vakt saleem ne apni bahaduree nahin dikhaai hoti, to shaayad aatankwaadiyon kii is karatuut kaa anjaam kahin or bhayanak hota

 The deadlock over the FDI debate in Parliament may have ended, but other questions remain
 guuruuvaar ko pramotion main aarakshan ke sawaal par rajyasabha nahin chal saki
 This time the matter of reservation in promotion came up
 rajyasabha main 117wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak par charchaa honi thi jiskaa vaasta isi masale se he
 Mayawati said, this bill must pass
 lekin, samaajawaadee party ke saansadon ne is par hangaamaa kar diya or 'aarakshan bill nahin chahie', ke naare lagaae
 The party says that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case twice before, so it will be a task to tease the court
 yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki epadiai kii bahes taalane ke liye sarkaar yah bill laa rahi he
 The comments jabaki bijepi kaa kahana he ki yah bill laane se pehle sarkaar supreme court ke faisalon par thik se nazar daal le
 The difficulty is that the conflict of this bill can also have an impact on the government's support in the FDI debate
 tarakkee main aarakshan kaa sawaal pechida he or samvedansheel bhi isliye sarkaar is bill par raajnneetik sahmati banaakar hi aage badhanaa chaahati he
 But, the dispute between the BSP and SP is clear that going ahead on this bill is going to prove to be a difficult challenge for the government

 party kaa kahana he ki supreme court is maamle ko pehle do baar kaarij kar chukaa he isliye yah court ko chidhaane kaa kaam hoga
 It also alleged that the government is bringing this bill to avert the FDI debate
 tippaniyan Whereas BJP says that the government should take a proper look at the decisions of the Supreme Court before bringing this bill
 mushkil yah he ki is bill ke takaraav kaa asar epadiai kii bahes main sarkaar ke samarthan par bhi pad saktaa he
 In the promotion, the question of reservation is complicated and sensitive too, so the government wants to move ahead by making political consensus on this bill
 lekin, basapa or sapa ke bich takaraar se saaf he ki is bill par aage badhanaa sarkaar ke liye ek mushkil chunauti sabit hone vaala he

 ise is rup main liya gaya ki ab vah sakriy raajnneeti se peeche hatakar party ke liye maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaayenge, lekin party ke manaane par vah maan gaye or disambar, 2009 tak netaa vipaksh bane rahe
 In the meantime, the RSS continuously pressured Advani to withdraw from active politics, but Advani's supporters ensured that a new post of President of the Parliamentary Party was created for Sushma Swaraj before she was given command of the Leader of the Opposition, so that her position in the party And the interference remained intact
 nitin gadakari ko bijepi adhyaksh banaakar aresas ne party par apni pakad majboot karne kaa sanket diya, to adwani kai muddon par gadakari se takaraate rahe
 Advani was also seen as a strong opposition to his not getting a second term
 bich main anna hajaare ke andolan ke dauraan adwani party ke bheetar kehete rahe ki bhrashtachar ke mudde par bijepi gambhir nahin dikhti
 During this time, he took out the Rath Yatra despite the reluctance of the RSS on the issue of withdrawal of black money
 makasad tha yah sandesh dena ki vah 2014 ke chunaav ke liye pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar bane hue hai
 Advani's rebellion came to the surface when Narendra Modi was made the chairman of the campaign committee in Goa in June 2013
 10 june ko unhone sabhi party padon se istipha de diya
 The party again fostered, but it could not get assurance from the RSS that they would be listened to while choosing the prime ministerial candidate
 balki sangh ne unki is daleel ko bhi ansuna kar diya ki bijepi ko apana pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar disambar, 2013 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad ghoshit karnaa chahie
 On 13 September 2013, when Modi was declared PM candidate, Advani remained at home
 unhone bayaan jari kar party adhyaksh rajnath singh par hamalaa bhi kiya ki party thik nahin chal rahi
 The RSS has been believing that Advani's contribution is crucial in leading the BJP to this point, but at the same time it is also an assessment that if the BJP has not been able to get back on track since the 2004 defeat, then it is due to Advani's top leader Has been acting as the leader of a faction
 yah kaha gaya ki jis adwani ko bataur sheersh netaa duusari peedi ke netaaon ke aapasi jhagade sulajhane chahie the, vah ek gut ke netaa ban gaye hai
 The RSS wants to give the command of the party entirely to the second generation leaders
 uski koshish thi ki laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi jaise diggaj netaa bajaae loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane ke, rajyasabha main jaaen, taaki ye sandesh diya ja sake ki ve ab sakriy raajnneeti main nahin, balki party ke maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Efforts are also made to contest the seats of Advani and Joshi i
e
 Gandhinagar and Benaras, so that the message of generational change can be sent
 saath hi, modi ke banaras se chunaav ladane se upi ke saath bihar ke bhi kuch hisson main phayda mili
 But both Advani and Joshi refused to go to the Rajya Sabha and thwarted the RSS plan
 gandhinagar se hi chunaav ladane kaa bayaan dekar adwani ne gend phir sangh ke paale main daal di he
 Advani also wanted his name to be announced in the first list released on Thursday, but the party did not do so
 modi ke kareebi or uttar pradesh ke prabharee mahasachiv amit shah ne saarvajanik rup se kah diya ki vah khud or party kii rajya ikai chaahate hai ki modi upi se chunaav laden
 That is, the final word on this dispute is yet to be said, but it seems clear that as a leader, Advani, who is leading the BJP from the floor to the hail, is doing less of the party and more of a loss of self-image by showing rebellion

 Kamal Khan of NDTV went to the addresses of these fake madrasas in many districts, and saw that there was a shop running at those addresses, a beauty parlor somewhere, and someone's house somewhere

 Some go with the help of government and some with donations
 madrason ko yah sarkari madad unki imaarat ke liye, teacheron ke vetan, furniture kharidne, computer kharidne aadi ke liye di jaati he
 So far in the government investigation, it has been found that there are 118 such madrasas which are running on the files and they are continuing to get government help
 upi sarkaar main alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri ajam khan ne bataaya ki jab is baat kaa pataa lagaaya gaya ki sarkari madad se kya hua
 Then it was revealed that many madrasas are not in reality, and their number is not less
 aise hi ek farji madrase kii talash main enditivi ke kamaal khan ek urdu akhbaar ke daftar pahunch gaye
 The editor of this newspaper, Hisam Siddiqui, said that the mosque in front of his office where the Namad is read, according to the official records, the madrasa runs

 He told that soon after the arrival of the postman, an inspector of the Minority Department came and took the check
 is dauraan unhen pataa chalaa ki saal main 70-75 hajaar rupee saal ke grant ke taur par vah farji rup se dilavaate hai
 Department officials come to take their share as soon as the check arrives

 The monsoon session of Parliament has been announced
 sansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar ne somvaar ko ye ghoshnaa kii he ki monsoon satr 18 july se 10 agast tak chalegaa
 In this session, which runs over 18 business days, apart from many important bills, the event on which everyone is eyeing is the election of the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 kyonki ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke khilaaf ekajute vipaksh ke bich jor aajamaaish hogi
 The election of the Deputy Chairman is Gorakhpur, after the Phulpur elections, the BJP had to face defeat in the Kairana Lok Sabha bye-elections, due to the strength of the opposition, followed by the election of the Deputy Chairman in the Rajya Sabha is a question of prestige for the BJP
 aapako bataa den ki rajyasabha ke upasabhapati pije courian kaa kaarykaal 30 june ko samaapt ho rahaa he lihaaja jaise hi sansad khulegi upasabhapati kaa chunaav anivaary ho jayega
 a candidate who wins in the 245-member Upper House will need 122 votes
 BJP badi party, lekin NDA ko bahumat nahinrajyasabha ke sanchaalan main apana dabadabaa banaae rakhane ke liye bhaajapa kii puri takat is pad par apane ummidavaar ko jitaane main lagi he
 The BJP is the largest party with 69 seats in the Rajya Sabha, but looking at the changing situation, the Telugu Desam Party is no longer a part of the NDA and the bjp's relationship with the Shiv Sena has also deteriorated in recent times
 aise main rajyasabha main abhi bhaajapa ke paas apana upasabhapati banane ke liye paryaapt sankhyabal nahin he
 Therefore, the pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah may have to make some political compromises to get enough support in this matter
 BJP ke paas hai ye do vikalpbhaajapa ke paas ek vikalp ye he ki bhaajapa ye pad tiares yaa wiesar congress ko de de
 In this situation, both the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha will move to Andhra or Telangana
 ek vikalp ye bhi he ki bhaajapa ye pad anna dramuk ko dene kii peshkash kare jiske paas 13 saansad hai
 However, modi-shah's style of functioning has not been to leave even an inch of political ground for a small party
 sanyukt vipaksh sankhya bal main he barirajyasabha main duusari sabase badi party congress kii sadsy sankhya 51 rah gai he
 But in the changed situation of opposition unity, if the combined number of Trinamool Congress 13, Samajwadi Party 6, TDP 6, DMK 4, BSP 4, NCP 4, CPI 4, CPI 1 and other non-bjp parties, they join BJP But they seem to be overshadowing
 agar 9 sadasyon vaali biju janata dal or shivasena apni tatasthta banaae rakhte hai to vipaksh ek baar phir modi-shah kii jodi ko patkhni de saktaa he
 Kejriwal's bets have also changed: The market of speculation about who will be made the candidate of the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson from Mathematics Congress or BJP is hot
 vahiin aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal is maamle main sanket de chuke hai ki ve kisi gaiyr congressi or gaiyr bhaajapai ummidavaar kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 Kejriwal's stakes and recently after the Chief Ministers of four states came to their support during the standoff between Delhi's Lieutenant Governor and Kejriwal, the regional parties have raised hopes that the Congress in Karnataka will keep the BJP away from power JD (S) 's HD Kumaraswamy has been made the Chief Minister for the same number of times and the cat's fate is broken

 " He was a professional criminal
 tees se bhi zyada mukademe uske naam the
 Then a year ago, he sees a girl in Connaught Place, Delhi
 use ladki se pyaar ho jaataa he
 After this, he follows him throughout the year
 usase na hi kabhi baat karata he, na hi miltaa he or na hi use tang karata he
 Even to stay close to him, he becomes an auto seller by buying an auto
 phir saal bhar baad achaanak ek roj wo kahata he, 'jahaan itane mukademe, vahaan ek mukadmaa mohabbat kaa bhi sahi
 'this is the whole story of Deepti's kidnapping of Ghaziabad
 'ek mukadmaa mohabbat kaa sahi'mohababt darasal vaihasaas he jo har dil main rahata he
 That is the passion which is scattered in the heart of Kayanat and just love is also a love of hatred on this same nature of love
 puraani kahawat he ki ishk andhaa hota he or nayaa sach ye ki ishk main log bhi andhe ho jate hai
 Otherwise, it does not make the lover love
 jurm main lipati mohabbat yaa yun kahen ki ekatarfa mohabbat kii aisi lav story duusari shaayad hi mili
 After kidnapping someone, he should leave it for himself and then ask 'are you going to make friends or enemies?' Have you ever seen such kidnapping? Every page of 'villain' Ghaziabad's 24-year-old Deepti's story of Kidnapping made to become a hero has been opened
 har rahasy ujagar ho gaya he or har sawaal kaa jawaab saamne aa chukaa he
 In Snapdeal, the engineer is about to kidnap Deepti, a professional criminal, but she did not kidnap him for money, but to arouse his love in his heart
 or baqayada ye soch kar kiya tha ki naakaam rahaa to kya hoga, itane mukademon ke bich ek mukadmaa mohabbat kaa sahi
 The full story of Deepti Kidnapping, a one-sided love story, begins in january-february 2015
 devendra ko pehali najar main hi dipti se pyaar ho jaataa he
 It then follows Deepti to get a glimpse of Deepti
 saal bhar main devendra ne kabhi dipti se baat karne kii koshish nahin kii
 Nor did he ever come across her as a lover
 par is dauraan dipti, uskaa ghar, daftar, gharavaale, dost sabake bare main pataa kar liya
 One-sided love passes with passion and with this, Devendra's unilateral love turns into passion
 wo kisi bhi keemat par dipti ko paanaa chahta tha
 But not as a villain but as a hero
 or isi koshish main usne ek ajeeb sajeesh rachi
 The plot to kidnap Deepti and the plot to become a hero in Deepti's eyes
 isi sajeesh ke tahat teen maheene pehle yani disambar main devendra do auto kharidta he or usee ilaake main auto chalaane lagata he, jahaan se dipti ghar se daftar or daftar se ghar aati-jaati thi
 Also included friends, in this conspiracy, he also involves two of his friends but does not tell them the truth of Deepti and his one sided love
 balki ek duusari kahani sunaata he
 The plot goes on
 is dauraan aise kuch maukey bhi milte hai jab dipti uske auto main baithti he or wo use ghar chhodane jaataa he
 But it used to be less
 kyonki dipti usee auto main baithti thi jisamen ek-do ladkiyaan baithti hon
 Deependra finally chooses the day of February 10 to kidnap Deepti, after all Rekhi and preparation is done by Deepti
 kidnaping ke baad kai jagahon se hote hue devendra dipti ko apane gaanv le jaataa he
 24 hours pass
 is dauraan devendra dari-sahami or roti dipti ko baar-baar samajhaata he, uskaa hausala badhaata he, uskaa khyaal rakhata he, use razaai detaa he or yahaan tak ki uskaa man-pasand khaanaa khilaataa he
 Galatmagar told the friend, he also repeatedly told Deepti that she has been abducted to introduce her to someone and that her friend is not a good person
 usase dur raho
 This was the same friend with whom Devendra first saw Deepti at Connaught Place
 dipti kii najaron main bana hirodevendra kii sajeesh kaa pehla charan puraa ho chukaa tha
 He had become good in the eyes of Deepti
 ab sajeesh kii agali kadi kii baari thi
 Devendra had to become a hero in the eyes of Deepti
 lihaaja wo baar-baar dipti se yahi kahata tha ki wo bura nahin he
 But those who have kidnapped him will save him
 saath hi saath wo lagaataar dipti ko ye bhi kahata rahaa ki jis dost ke saath wo conot place main gum rahi thi usase wo dur rahe
 Then when Devendra is convinced, then he himself goes to the railway station with Deepti
 dost bana kar ja rahi ho yaa dushman?ye wo aakhri line thi jo devendra ne dipti ko reeha karte hue kahi thi
 Actually Devendra never intended to harm Deepti, kill or take ransom
 isliye jaise hi use laga ki wo dipti kii najaron main acha ban gaya he usne dipti ko reeha kar diya
 On 12 February, Devendra himself took Deepti to the village station with her and placed her in a train going to Delhi
 police kaa sirdard bana causatrain main baithte hi dipti ne ek musafir se phone lekar apane ghar kol kiya or phir ba-hifaazat ghar pahunch gai
 Now since Deepti came home by herself, she did not get any injury, nor did she get any call for ransom
 lihaaza police shuruuaat main uljhi rahi
 He also suspected many of Deepti's statements
 lekin phir jaanch main sach saamne aa hi gaya
 After being a graduate, Devendrascha revealed his own story in the presence of the police
 devendra ke sir se ekatarfa ishk kaa bukhaar utraa yaa nahin ye to nahin pataa lekin par giraftaar ke baad ab wo ye jarur kah rahaa he ki uske raste alag hai or dipti ke alag
 Listen to the story of Devendra
 haryana kaa rahane vaala devendra padhaa-likhaa criminal he
 The graduate is a fan of Devendra Shahrukh Khan, Hitler and Genghis Khan
 darasal devendra ko kai kitaaben pard kar filmein dekhne ke baad hi ye khyaal aayaa ki uski jindagi main ek khubasurat ladki ho jiske saath wo ghar basaae
 For this, he was ready to leave the world of crime
 or is tarah iktarafa ishk kaa anjaam vahi hua jo hona tha
 Yes, Devendra certainly made it true that where there are so many cases, there is a right of love

 Gave 77 acres of disputed land in favor of the deity 'ram Lala' and directed the Center to give 5 acres of land in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board to build a mosque
 is maamle main 18 punarvichaar yachikaayen daakhil kii gai hai
 The Supreme Court has filed four reconsideration petitions on the Ayodhya dispute with the support of the Muslim Personal Law Board
 in yachikaaon main kaha gaya he ki faisla 1992 main masjid dhahaae jane ko manjuuri dene jaisaa he
 The verdict was ruled in favor of the illegally placed statue
 avaidh harakat karne waalon ko zamin di gai
 Hindus never had complete occupation there
 musalamaanon ko paanch acre jameen dene kaa faisla puraa insaaf nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The Supreme Court stayed the November 9 decision
 maamle par dobaaraa vichaar kare
 Reconsideration petitions have been filed by Missbahuddin, Maulana Hasbullah, Haji Mahboob and Rizwan Ahmed
 agar khuli adaalat main sunwaayee hui to in sabhi yachikaaon main vakil rajeev dhawan honge
 The petitions state that these petitions have been filed not to disturb peace and harmony, but to seek justice
 muslim sampatti hameshaa hi hinsa or anuchit vyavhaar kaa shikaar hui he
 The judgment gives the advantage of demolition of the mosque in 1992
 avaidh rup se rakhi gai murti kanoonee rup se vaid nahin ho sakati or iske paksh main faisla sunaaya gaya he
 The Supreme Court's November 9 verdict reflects the grave illegalities of the destruction of the Babri Masjid, the illegal entry and violation of the rule of law
 nirvivaad tathy yah he ki hindu kabhi bhi exclusive kabje main nahin rahaa
 Hindus have claimed based on the evidence found in illegality
 yachikaaon main supreme court (supreme Court) ke paanch acre jameen dene ke faisle par bhi sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 It is said that no such "restoration" can take place after destroying the place of worship
 yah koi kammertial suut nahin tha balki civil suut tha
 The Supreme Court's conclusion that there is evidence to show that Hindus worshiped before 1857 in the mosque's premises is flawed
 yah dikhaane ke liye saboot hai ki muslim 1857 or 1949 ke bich aantarik angan ke exclusive kabje main the
 The court's findings are not correct that the mosque side was not able to prove adverse possession
 jamiyat ulema e hind ke samarthan se supreme court main punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii gai he
 It has asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the November 9 decision
 yah yachika em siddiq kii ore se daakhil kii gai he
 The petition states that the Supreme Court's conclusion is not correct that there is evidence to show that Hindus worshiped before 1857 in the mosque's premises
 ye bhi nishkarsh sahi nahin ki yah dikhaane ke liye saboot hai ki muslim 1857 or 1949 ke bich aantarik angan ke kabje main the
 The Supreme Court in its conclusion had said that the mosque side was not able to prove adverse possession and this is also not true
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court (supreme Court) ne eesai kii report main padhaa tha ki yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya tha ki masjid khaali bhoomi par nahin ai thi balki ek gaiyr-islamic sanrachana ke khandhiron par jo ki 10 veen shatabdi ke bade paimaane par hindu dhaanche se milti julati thi
 This is also not correct
 court ne yatriyon, itihaaskaaron or lekhakon ke khaaton ke rup main hindu paksh dwaara die gaye sabooton ko sweekaar kiya lekin hamaare dwaara susajjit ek hi sakshya ko andekha kar diya
 The Court came to a conclusion that the Muslims had not provided any evidence to show that they were in exclusive possession of the internal courtyard prior to 1857, which is not correct
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court ne is nishkarsh par galati kii he ki hindu log nirvivaad rup se masjid ke andar puja karte the jo bheetar ke garbhagrih ko bhagwaan ram kaa janm sthaan maanate hai
 The decision to grant five acres of land to the Muslim side under Article 143 to the Muslim side is also not correct
 jamiyat ne court ke faisle ke un teen binduon ko focus kiya he jisamen aitihaasik galatiyon kaa zikr he
 But the verdict was exactly the opposite
 awwal to ye ki supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha he ki is baat ke pukhta saboot nahin mili hai ki mandir todakar masjid banaai gai thi
 Secondly, it was also wrong to keep the idols in the inner courtyard on the night of 22–23 December 1949
 6 disambar 1992 ko vivaadit dhaancha todna bhi galat tha
 But instead of punishing these mistakes, they were given full land
 lihaaza court is faisle par phir se vichaar kare
 The All India Hindu Mahasabha has also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main sunni vakf board ko 5 acre jameen die jane ke faisle par punarvichaar karne kii maang kii gai he
 The petition said that the Supreme Court's decision to grant five acres of land to the Muslim side under Article 142 is not correct as it was a civil suit
 jab court ne decri ramalala ko di he to is tarah vaikalpik jameen dene kaa koi auchity nahin he
 The petition also said that the Supreme Court in its November 9 verdict has described the structure as a mosque, which is also not correct as the court itself has admitted that there was a temple under it
 jab paanch jajon kii peeth ne vakf board ko hakdaar nahin mana ko dhaanche ko masjid kaise kaha ja saktaa he
 The petition has also questioned the Supreme Court's comments that the demolition of the Babri Masjid on 6 December 1992 was against the law
 vakil vishnu jain dwaara daakhil yachika main hindu mahasabha kaa kahana he ki court ko in tippaniyon ko hataanaa chahie kyonki iskaa sidhaa asar lakhanu kii vishesh sibiai adaalat main chal rahe aapraadhik sajeesh ke trial par padegaa
 In this case, academics and activists have also reached the Supreme Court
 unhone ram janmabhumi- babari masjid maamle main 9 november ke faisle par punarvichaar yachika daakhil kii he
 Economist Prabhat Patnaik and activist and former IAS officer Harsh Mander are the main petitioners
 is yachika ke pramukh naamon main itihaaskaar irfan habib, lekhika farah nakvi, samajashastri nandini sundar, activist shabnam hashmi, aakaar patel, kavi or vaigyanik gauhar raja, lekhak natwar badhwaar, arthshaastri jayati ghosh, itihaaskaar tanika sarkaar va sevanivrutt rajanyik or aam aadmi party kii purv sadsy madhu bhadudi shaamil hai
 The petition states that the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case has been considered as a dispute between Hindus and Muslims in India
 jabaki ye maamla swayambhu sanghathanon ke bich tha jo hinduon or musalamaanon kii bhaawanaaon or hiton kaa pratinidhitiv karne kaa daawa karte hai
 But there is no clear mandate to do so, nor is there empirical evidence that they broadly support people of these religions
 faisle main mukademebaajon or sanghathanon ke naam “hindu" yaa "muslim" ke rup main liye gaye hai
 Justifying his plea in the case, the activist says that the Supreme Court itself has expanded the scope of the case in a title suit for ownership and occupation of property for a debate about the faith of Hindus and Muslims
 lekin is maamle main yachikakartaon se alag hindu or musalamaanon ko kabhi nahin suna
 In doing so, it has empowered every Indian to seek court relief on the title suit issue
 yachika main 9 november ke faisle par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye hai or kaha gaya he ki ye faisla ek paksh kii ore jhukta najar aa rahaa he
 Nirmohi Akhara has also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court
 akhaada ne yachika main kaha he ki supreme court ne apane 9 november ke faisle main centre ko ram mandir nirmaan ke liye banane vaale trust main ise paryaapt pratinidhitiv dene kaa nirdesh diya tha
 More than a month has passed since the decision but so far its role and representation have not been defined
 akhaada is sambandh main spashtikaran chahta he
 Disputed acquired in petition 2
 77 acre jameen ke baahar iske swaamitv vaale kai mandiron ko waapas karne kii maang kii bhi kii gai he
 The Peace Party has also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki supreme court kaa faisla puri tarah se eesai report par aadhaarit he na ki tathyon par
 Until 1949, the possession was always with the Muslims and the Indian Evidence Act 110 was not followed
 hindu pakshakaron dwaara jhooth bolaa gaya
 Namaz was performed in the mosque under the central dome until 1949, and before 1949 there were no idols
 1949 se pehle koi bhi hindu prarthana nahin karata tha
 There is no evidence given by the ASI that there was a temple dedicated to Rama
 san 1885 main ram chabutara ram mandir tha jo babari masjid kaa bahari angan he
 It had the right to the inner courtyard of the Muslim side
 lekin haal ke faisle main yah sarvocch nyaayalay dwaara sthapit nahin kiya gaya he
 The Shia Waqf Board has also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya case
 isamen sunni vakf board ko masjid banane ke liye paanch acre jameen dene kaa virodh kiya gaya he
 It has been said that even if land is given, it should be out of Ayodhya and not for mosque but for hospital etc

 5 stardiarecturerohit dhawankalakaarjon abraham, varun dhawan, akshay khanna or jacleen furnandiskoi bhi film kahani jaise mahatvapurn factor par tiki hoti he
 If the story has power, then there is no problem in crossing the film's box office Vaitarani and if the story itself is flawed, then whatever style and swag is put in the film, its fate cannot be changed
 lekin dekha gaya he ki bollywood main sitaron ke naam par kai kharaab filmein bhi acha kar jaati hai or yahi baat galat rujhaan paidaa bhi kar rahi he
 'dhishoom' is one such film which seems to be swinging between all these factories
 film kii kahani predictable he
 The characters are much like the 1970s- 80s
 rohit dhawan ne film main har vah masala pirone kii koshish kii jo film ko box offis par ghaseetne main madad kar sake
 But the binding factor in the film is missing
 kahani main kitna dam:saaqib saleem ek cricketer hai or unka apharan ho jaataa he
 India has a cricket match with Pakistan for two days
 phir lift se lekar plane ke paas tak khadey hokar cigarette pine vaale adhikari jon abraham ko is cricketer ko dhundne kaa kaam saunpa jaataa he, jo use bahut hi khamoshi ke saath karnaa hota he
 He chooses a worthless fellow, Varun Dhawan, to help him in this task
 is kaam main ek choti-moti chorni jacleen unki madad karti he
 Akshay Khanna as a villain, and he enjoys listening to his name more than his work
 ' film puri tarah se rohit shetty ke andaaj main chalati he, kuch kamedi kaa chhaunk lagaao, shandaar ection ghusaao or kahani ko bacseet par daal do
 Star Appeal: John Abraham does good action and his acting is also good
 sakht adhikari ke taur par ve apane kairactor main ekadam set baithe hai, or unhone apane role ko bakhubi nibhaayaa bhi he
 Varun Dhawan has been given the task to make him laugh in the film and has been given some punch lines
 ye panch line thodaa tang karti hai or har film ke saath aisa lagata he ki dwen johnson 'da rock' or govinda kuch zyada hi un par haaavee hai
 Govinda's style is very much seen in his acting, and especially during comedy and dance
 phir pariniti chopra ke saath unka dance number hamen govinda ke andaaj ke gaanon kii yaaden taaja kar detaa he
 Jacqueline Fernandes' role is also fine, she tries her best to fulfill what has been assigned to her
 akshay khanna villen ke kirdaar main laute hai lekin vah daraa nahin pate hai or vah acting to acchhee kar hi lete hai lekin unka kairactor kaaphi kamjor or puraane tip kaa he
 Even if Akshay Kumargar did not do a funny type of cameo in the film, the health of the film was not going to make any difference
 kamai kii baat:'dhishum' bade bajet kii film he, jisamen ection or loketions par acha-khaasaa kharch kiya gaya he
 If a little time had been put on the story, it would have been nice and the stereotype would have been good for the health of both the film and the actor avoiding things
 film main cricket jaisaa factor bhi daalaa gaya he or bhartiya team ke khilaadiyon ke naamon ko jodakar viraaj sharma jaisaa kairactor bhi gadha gaya he
 Its budget is between 60-70 crores rupees
 is tarah film ke liye box offis par safar aasaan nahin rahegaa
 But it is that if the mind is not stressed, then Dhishoom can be seen once
