 Even after Team India's 125-run win over West Indies in the Cricket World Cup, Captain Kohli has expressed concern over the team's batting

 After the match victory, Kohli said, 'I have nothing to say to my batsmen
 unako apni majbootee or apni kamajori ke hisaab se talmail baithaana hoga, saath hi pich ke mutabik khelnaa hoga
 This is my strategy
 main apane tareeke se kheltaa hum
 i am happy with one or two runs
 mere adhiktar ran isi tarah se aate hai
 We got two difficult pitches, but i am happy with my contribution
 'kohli ne kaha, 'main shikaayat nahin kar saktaa
 We became the No
 1 team only yesterday
 ham usee tarah se khel rahe hai or ise hi jari rakhana chahenge
 In the last two matches, things didn't go in our favor with the bat, but we still did well
 yah mere liye kaaphi santoshjanak baat he
 Kohli praised Dhoni Kohli also praised Dhoni and Hardik Pandya
 captain ne kaha, 'dhoni jaanate hai ki unhen maidan par kya chahie
 Everyone starts talking when they have a bad day

 The best thing about Dhoni is that when you need 15-20 runs in the last, he gives you
 unka anubhav 10 main se aath baar hamaare kaam aayaa he

 ek or jahaan rashtriya janata dal or congress, nitish kumaar ke is faisle se naaraaz hai, vahiin duusari ore bijepi is faisle se kaaphi utsahit he

 manish tiwari ne kargil, qandahar, kaluchak or sansad hamale ko endie kaarykaal kaa mile kaa pathar bataaya
 bjp's statement about Afzal's hanging was also unfortunate

 Before making such statements, they should look into their girban

 After this statement by Manish Tiwari, the rhetoric against the government from BJP leaders became more intensified

 ) Team India are playing their first match on the Zimbabwe tour
 is series main team india ko yuva khilaadiyon kaa damakham parakhane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 The ODI series has started and everyone's eyes are on Team India's young brigade
 is match se karun nair or yajuvendra chahal kaa vanade debyue ho rahaa he
 For the third time in the last 4 years, Team India is visiting Zimbabwe
 tippaniyan But for young players, this tour proves like a double-edged sword
 achche pradarshan ke baavjood team main jagah pakki hona tay nahin, lekin kharaab pradarshan par aalochana kaa shikaar hona pad saktaa he
 Even if the team sweeps Zimbabwe, they will get only 1 point and their ranking will not be affected
 yuva khilaadiyon ke liye ye zarur bada mauqaa he ki unhen team india kii numaaindgi kaa mauqaa mil rahaa he
 But those players who have been a part of Team India before also believe that no matter what the opposition team is, there is no option to perform well
 sabase bada imtihaan yahaan captain emes dhoni ke liye hi he
 He himself has said that he has not thought about retirement yet
 lekin aalochak dhoni kii har pari par paini nigahen rakhte hai
 Therefore, his future will be discussed after every series
 khaas baat ye he ki maahi ke paas jitna anubhav he utana anubhav puri team ke paas nahin he
 Therefore, it will be interesting to see how much India's young players take advantage of the opportunity in the face of a weak Zimbabwe challenge
 lekin yuva khilaadiyon ke liye ye daura kisi dodhari talwaar kii tarah sabit hota he
 Despite a good performance, it is not certain to be confirmed in the team, but poor performance may have to be criticized
 team agar zimbabwe kaa safaaya bhi kar detii he to bhi use sirf 1 hi ank milegaa or uski ranking par koi asar nahin padegaa
 It is a big opportunity for young players that they are getting the opportunity to represent Team India
 lekin wo khilaadi jo pehle bhi team india kaa hissaa rah chuke hai wo maanate hai ki vipakshi team koi bhi ho achche pradarshan kaa koi vikalp nahin he
 The biggest test is for captain MS Dhoni here

 The special thing is that Mahi does not have as much experience as the entire team
 isliye dekhnaa dilachasp rahegaa ki zimbabwe kii kamazor chunauti ke saamne bharat ke yuva khilaadi haath main aaye mauqe kaa kitna phayda uthaate hai

 Team India's selection for the Test series against Australia is due on Tuesday

 This batsman is in excellent form
 pakistan ne rachaa itihaas, 20 saal baad australia ke khilaaf jiti siries,sachin hai 11 australian khilaadiyon se mahaan, kyonki
 
 
 KL Rahul may get Moukarahul scored two centuries (185 and 130 runs) for South in the Duleep Trophy final against Central Zone, although his team lost the match
 sandip patil kii aguwai vaala sellection panel karnataka ke is yuva ballebaaj ko murali vijay or shikhar dhawan ke baad tisare salaami ballebaaj ke taur par shaamil kar saktaa he
 Rahul could be selected in place of the experienced Gautam Gambhir who replaced Dhawan in the last two Tests against England, but could not even cross the score of 20 in four innings
 rahul ko haalanki karnataka ke hi robin uthppa se kade mukaable kaa saamana karnaa padegaa jinhone dilip trophy main purv kshetra ke khilaaf shatak jamaaya tha
 Dravid's desire to get KL Rahul and Karn to get chance Want to see dravid ne kaha, 'usne gharelu sijan main 1000 se adhik ran banaae or dilip trophy final main do shatak ke saath vah acchhee farm main lag rahaa tha isliye agar aap yuva khilaadi ko mauka dena chaahate ho to use us samay chunaa janaa acha he jab vah acchhee form main he or asal main acha khel rahaa he
 You can initially select him as an alternate opener
 dravid chaahate hai ki test team main karn ko rabindra jadeja par tavajjo di jaae kyonki australia main kalai ke spinner ke safal hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, khaskar tab jab vah hawa main tej gend phenkata ho or uske paas acchhee gugali ho
 There can be two wicketkeepers, the selectors included in the team will also consider the second wicketkeeper
 isamen muqabla riddhimaan saaha or naman ojha ke bich hoga
 Ojha scored a double century in the Duleep Trophy match against North Zone but failed in the final
 duusari ore saaha srilanka ke khilaaf vanade siries main mahendra singh dhoni kii jagah wicketcaping kar rahe hai, lihaaja unhen tarjeeh mil sakati he
 Shami, Aaron's injury increased difficulties
 
 
 tej gendbaaj mohammad shami or varun aaron ko lagi chot ne mushkilen badhaa di he
 Both of them will be able to go to Australia only if they have passed the fitness test
 bhartiya team 21 november ko australia ravaanaa hogi
 Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar will lead the pace attack while Stuart Binny can make it to the team as an all-rounder
 binni ne purv ke khilaaf dilip trophy match main saat wicket chatkaaye
 Umesh Yadav is also an option in fast bowling, but Pankaj Singh of Rajasthan could not meet the expectations
 ishwar pandey ko england main istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 Singh can be preferred if Shami and Aaron do not play
 spinner ke taur par karn sharma ko mil saktaa he maukaspin main aar aswin or ravindra jadeja ke alaava tisare vikalp ke rup main uttar pradesh ke karn sharma ko mauka mil saktaa he
 Provided that the selectors decide not to choose the experienced Amit Mishra or Piyush Chawla
 ballebaaji main madhyakram main rohit sharma ne srilanka ke khilaaf practice match main jataa diya ki vah ungali kii chot se ubar chuke hai
 Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit and captain Dhoni will strengthen the middle order

 Shani affects our life in many ways and often do not recognize their power, they fall prey to their crooked eyes
 shani kii tedi najar un par hi padati he jo bure karmon main lipt rahete hai chaahe wo bure karm jane-anjaane hi kyon naa hue ho
 Shanidev sits in these 6 places
 
 
 aaie jaane, shanidev kii tedi najar ke asar ke bare main
 
 
 It is important that Saturn's vision is a planet of balance and justice
 galat or beyimaan logon ko peedit karte hai to eemaandaar, parishramee logon ko puraskrit karte hai
 Saturn is called the boundary planet because where the influence of the Sun ends, the influence of Saturn starts from there
 jyotish ke jaankaron kaa ye maananaa he shani kii najar behad mahatvapurn he
 - Every planet has a single vision which is known as the seventh vision
 - lekin brihaspati, mangal or shani ke paas anya drushtiyaan bhi hoti hai
 - Saturn has the most powerful vision among all the planets
 - iske paas saatvin ke alaava teesri or dasvin drushti bhi hoti he
 - This vision, planet or person falls on the person's vision
 - shani kii drushti alag-alag grahon par padakar alag-alag dushprinaam paidaa karti he
 Shani Dev remains calm by worshiping Hanumanji
 
 
 bure karmon kii sajaa denge shani- karm nindaneey hai to shani durbhaagya denge
 - Shani will make a pauper on bad deeds
 - shani bure karm karne waalon kaa vivek khatm kar dete hai
 - Decision power does not work when Saturn is badly affected
 - shani kii tedi najar se hameshaa asafalataa milti he
 - Irritation remains due to Saturn's crooked eye
 shani kii chaal kaa kya rahegaa prabhaichche karm dilaayenge shani krupa- shanidev achche karm waalon kaa bhagyoday karte hai
 - Shanidev makes good use of the wealth of the auspicious
 - shanidev grihasth jivan ko sukhad banaate hai
 - Inspire austerity by motivating you to follow the path of religion
 swaastik karegaa har manokamana purishani kii najar grahon kaa asarain sari baton ko jaanakar aap ek baat samaj gaye honge ki shanidev sirf bura nahin karte balki wo bure logon ke saath bure or achche logon ke saath achche hai
 Astrologers believe that Saturn's crooked eye has different side effects according to planets
 - surya par drushti ho to vyakti kaa daanpaty jivan kharaab hota he
 - It does not make good relations between father and son
 - agar chandramaa par ho to teevr vairaygy paidaa hota he
 - By this the person is a monk or mental patient
 - agar shani kii najar mangal par ho to visphot jaisi sthiti aati he
 - Due to its effect, there are chances of severe accident
 - budh par drushti ho to vyakti dhoort, chaalaak hota he
 - But this causes skin problems
 - brihaspati par drushti ho to vyakti pet kaa rogi hota he
 - It is also knowledgeable and egoistic
 - shukr par drushti ho to charitra dosha ho jaataa he
 If a person is sighted on Rahu or Ketu, then the person is a victim of intoxication
 - lekin kabhi kabhi raajnneeti main safalataa paa jaataa he
 Know the importance of incense and lamp in worship will be beneficial - when Saturn sees its zodiac or higher zodiac
 - jab shani mesh, kark yaa singh raashi main ho
 - When Jupiter is sighted on Saturn
 - jab shani kumbh raashi main ho
 - When the sight of Saturn is beneficial, then the person makes wealth
 - saath hi vyakti ghar se dur jaakar safal hota he
 Keep these things in mind to get the grace of Shani
 The experts of astrology believe that to get the grace of Shani, it is very important to keep some things in mind
 aaie jaane, shani kii krupa kab or kaise milti he
 
 
 -when a person speaks the truth and remains disciplined
 - jab vyakti kamjor or nirbal logon kii khub seva karata he
 - When the person serves his elder elders
 - jab vyakti faldaar or lambi avadhi tak rahane vaale ped lagaataa he
 - When a person worships Lord Shiva or Krishna faithfully
 kuch saral upaay shani ko karenge prasandgar shani naaraaz ho jaaen to jivan main pareshaaniyon kaa ambara lag jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is important to know what are the measures to avoid the evil eye of Saturn
 taaki shani kii krupa aap par bani rahe
 There are some simple remedies in astrology that you can avoid by crooked eye of Saturn
 - kabhi bhi shani ke kisi aisi murti ke darshan naa karen jisamen shani kii ankhen ho
 - Wearing red clothes every Saturday, stand in front of Hanuman
 - hanuman chalisa kaa paath karen
 - Chant the mantra of Shani Dev every evening by lighting a lamp in the west direction
 - ghar ke chhoton or sahaayakon ke saath acha vyavhaar rakhen
 - Use blue color more and more
 iske saath hi aap kuch or upayon se shani ko prasann kar sakate hai
 
 
 - Be honest in life, speak the truth and give respect to the elders
 - tulsi ke paudhe main or pipal main jal daalen
 - Burn a mustard oil lamp under the crossroads or people on Saturday evening
 - kabhi bhi hare ped naa kaaten, garbhpaat naa karavaayen
 - Must wake up before sunrise and worship Shiva
 - shani dev ke mul mantra ' shan shanaishcharai namah' kaa jaap karen

 sarkaar ne kisaanon ke paas se 1575 rupee dekar kharida tha
 According to sources, there was no electricity in the Ram Rajya Ginning Mill in the warehouse where there was a fire
 ye shaq jataayaa ja rahaa he ki aag shock circuit se lagi hogi
 The Congress is talking about a big plan behind this
 congress ke junagarh ke jila adhyaksh harshad rabadia kaa kahana he ki is maamle main junagarh jilacongresske sabhi netaa vighayak or jila adhyaksh ne jila majistrate ko ek gyaapan 22 janvari ko hi diya tha
 They suspected that fire or crop stock might be stolen
 35 kilo moongfalee bhari hone ke saath hi kariban do lakh boriyon main bhari moongfalee aag ke kaaran khaak ho gai
 The cost to the government was Rs 1800 per bag due to expenditure of Rs 225 on groundnut purchased at support price of Rs 1575 per bag
 do lakh bori kii kul keemat 36 karod hota he
 As soon as the Congress targeted the government over the fire in this warehouse, the government also handed over the investigation of the fire to the CID (crime)
 ise pehle kuccha main bhi moongfalee ke ek godaam main aag lagi thi
 The question is clear, when the fire was not caused by a short circuit then how did the fire start? lahore main buudhvaar ko shiya musalamaanon ke juluus par hue silsilewar dhamaakon main maare gaye logon kii taadaad badhkar 37 ho gai he

 This year August 15 is going to be very special and stressful for Bollywood
 kyonki is saal swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par ek baar phir akshay kumaar or jon abraham ek-duusare se box offis par takaraane vaale hai
 But there is also a big twist in this and that this time Akshay and John will also be part of this collision, Bahubali Prabhas
 is saal 15 agast ke maukey par akshay kumaar kii film mishan mangal, jon abraham kii film bottla house or prabhas kii film saaho kaa klesh hone vaala he
 In such a situation, it has become difficult for the stars as well as the audience and critics
 fain or critics ke man main sawaal he ki is bade weekend par kiski film ko pehle dekha jaae or kisko naa dekha jaae
 It is obvious that when big movies of three big stars are released on a big day, not one, not two, then the fans are bound to get confused
 aise main trade analist taran adarsh ne apane letest video ke jariye phens ke dil kii baat kah di he
 Regarding the clash of Mission Mangal vs Batla House vs Saaho, the question remains in the mind of the audience as to which movie to watch and who to release
 taran apane nae video main sawaal kar rahe hai ki kya in teen badi filmon ko dekhne ke liye aam darshakon ke paas itnaa vakt or itnaa paisa or itani ichha he ki wo in apane parivaar ke saath ek hi hafte main teen filmein dekh paae? iske alaava gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki kyonki ye teen badi filmein hai, to inke bich screens, footfal or bijness ke bant jayega
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whose film will have its advantages and disadvantages

 At the same time, the fact is that every political party, as a political group, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, has the ability to castigate them because of their ability to influence elections

 In January this year, the suicide of Dalit researcher Rohit Vemula at the Hyderabad Central University sparked anger across the country, in response to which a debate took place in Parliament and Modi was forced to respond

 isliye gujarat ke daliton ke saath jo hoga, vah upi or bihar ke daliton par pakkaa asar daalega
 Obviously, then all parties will want to take maximum advantage of this issue, because this will unite the Dalit votes

 party kuch dalit netaaon ko bhi saath lekar ai, jaise rajya ke purv dijipi brijlaal or bispi se rajyasabha saansad rah chuke jugal kishor, jinhone mayawati par tikat bechney kaa aarope lagaakar unhen ''dalit kii beti" kii jagah ''daulat kii beti" qaraar diya
 In May, the BJP organized a harmony bath during Simhastha in Ujjain where Shah took a dip with Dalit saints and later dined with them
 is maukey par madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bhi maujuud the or aayojan sthal par bhimrao ambedkar, sant ravidaas, valmiki or kabir ke poster lagaae gaye the
 All this exercise may have been done to make the Dalit face of the party more influential, but the party is beating in one case that there is a lack of strong Dalit leaders at the national and state level
 congress is maamle main us par bees padati he
 Modi may have included four Dalit ministers in the recent cabinet expansion, but none has been given any important portfolio
 iske ulat upie ke raaj main dekhen to susheel kumaar scindia or mallikarjun khadeye jaise dalit netaa bade vibhaagon grih or railway ke mantri rahe
 Meira Kumar, speaker of the Lok Sabha in the UPA Raj, is the daughter of Dalit leader Jagjivan Ram
 jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main centre for da study of soshal systams main professor vivek kumaar kehete hai, ''bijepi ne haalanki baahar se kuch dalit netaa jarur aayaat kiye hai jaise sanjay paswan, satyanarayan jatiya or ramnath kovid
 “that is why his contact with the ground is cut off
 baba sahib kii viraasat kabjane kii hodedaliton ke samarthan or donon rashtriya dalon bijepi or congress kii palatati kismat ke bich jo rishta he, usee ne desh ke sabase bade dalit nayak bhim raav ambedkar kii viraasat ko kabjane kii hode ko janm diya he
 The seriousness with which the BJP is pursuing Dalit votes is evident from the party's U-turn on Ambedkar during the past decade — Arun Shourie, who was a top minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, once dubbed him a "false god" While the Modi government has started a series of programs to celebrate Ambedkar's contribution to India's social and political fabric
 aresas kaa mukhpatr orgeniser bhi ambedkar ke sammaan main ''ultimate uniphaire" (sabko ek karne vaala) kaa prayog kar rahaa he
 During his visit to London last November, Modi unveiled a memorial at the site where Ambedkar lived during the days of the London School of Economics
 pradhanmantri ne mumbai main ambedkar smarak kii bhi aadharshila rakhi or 21 march ko dilli ke 25, alipur road par ek sabhaagaar kii neenv rakhi, jahaan ambedkar kii maut hui thi
 He also paid homage to the father of the Indian Constitution at his birthplace Mhow in Indore, declared the day as Social Harmony Day and prepared the United Nations to celebrate Ambedkar's 125th birthday
 ambedkar par modi ke is tufaani kaarykram se aarambh main to congress ko bada jhatka laga, lekin vah der se jaagi or usne apni ore se kii gai unki aitihaasik upeksha ko sweekaar kiya
 Says Raju, "he did the work of constitution together with Congress, but we did not make any effort to adopt his legacy till 125th birthday
" pehle bispi ne unhen kabjaya, ab saare dal yahi kar rahe hai
 "to stake its claim on Ambedkar, the Congress organized a big rally in Nagpur on his birthday
 jaisi ki apeksha thi, donon hi dalon ko bispi pramukh mayawati kii khari-khoti sunani padi, jo ambedkar kii viraasat kii mul daavedaar hai
 Addressing a huge rally in Lucknow on Ambedkar's 125th birthday, he accused the BJP and the Congress that these parties were only using Ambedkar's name to garner Dalit votes whereas they have never in the past cared for Ambedkar or Dalits
 Nobody cared
 dalit-kendrit vipaksh?una kii ghatana or mayawati par bijepi netaa dayashankar singh kii abhadra tippanee ke baad daliton se judi chunavi raajnneeti main ek bada badlaav yah aayaa he ki bispi ko nayaa jeevandaan mil gaya he
 Due to the dismal performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, many big leaders left Mayawati, but the party becoming redundant has suddenly come into the limelight again
 dalit samarthan chhijane or brahmanon ke bijepi kii ore rukh karne se bispi ke liye 2007 vidhansabha chunaavon jaisaa dalit-brahman sameekaran kii dobaaraa sambhaavna nahin dikh rahi thi
 But after Dayashankar Singh's remarks, the BSP demonstrated its strength by holding a massive rally in Lucknow

 It has prepared a team of 400 youths from all the 75 districts of the state, who will go to the dalits and tell about the work of Congress and its future policies for the welfare of Dalits
 raju kehete hai, ''pehle hamaara sandesh 35 saal se upar ke umr waalon ke liye tha
 Now we are focusing on the age group of 18 to 35 years
 " congress uttar pradesh or punjab main apni khoi jameen paane ke liye 2017 vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle do ghoshnaa-patr jari karegi
 One, with general electoral promises, and the other, a special Dalit manifesto, which will be the focus on this important political class
 uttar pradesh main sattarudh sapa ne bhi haal main apni essi / asti shakha ko sakriy kiya he or rajya ke sabhi 18 sambhag main dalit maha-sammelan yojit karne kii yojana banaai he
 She is especially focusing on castes like Pasi, Valmiki, Kori and Beria

 punjab ke chaar jilon kapoorthala, jalandhar, hoshiyarpur or navanshahar main kareeb 40 fisadi matadaata dalit hai
 Kejriwal has also had talks with the Ravidas community in Dera Balan and the Valmiki community in Jalandhar
 ek maheene pehle ve simavarti jile abohar main sharaab mafia shivlal doda ke farmahouse mansh 2015 main berahami se katl kiye gaye dalit bhim tank ke parijanon se milane gaye the

 It is very important for the Congress to bring back the Dalits, who once used to be its mainstay in Punjab

 But the party suffered a setback in the Rajya Sabha elections last month

 After that Hans Raj Hans announced not to support the Congress

 Four AIMIM Dalits and one OBC candidate won there
 maharashtra main dalit or musalamaanon ko ek manch par laane kii koshish pehali dfa nahin hui he
 The BSP and the Congress are trying to create such an equation in Uttar Pradesh, whereas the BJP seems committed to eliminate any such equation in the beginning

 It was due to this polarization that the BJP achieved huge success in the 2014 elections
 raju kehete hai, ''hamaari party kii alpsankhyak or essi shakha donon talmail ke saath kaam kar rahi hai
 "the ban on beef and the Dadri incident in 2015 are also helping the opposition form the dalit-muslim equation
 gujarat ke rajnatik vishleshak vidyut thakar kehete hai, ''bijepi kaa in jhatkon se ubarna mushkil ho saktaa he
 At the national level, the opposition is trying to draw a dalit-muslim equation against Modi in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 "shaayad dalit yaa musalamaanon ke mudde prabhavi bane rahenge
 Demonstrative events will also be held to show solidarity with these communities, but when will the ground realities change? Perhaps this question should be asked to Shah, Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal or any leader before going to a Dalit's house for food, that Rs 5,000

 mukhyamantri akhileshne apane bajet bhaashan kii shuruyaat janata ko dhanyavad dene ke saath kii
 He said that if the people have formed a majority government then it is the responsibility of the government to live up to their expectations
 akhilesh ne kaha ki purvavarti basapa sarkaar main jo ghotaale hue, uski vajah se pradesh kaaphi aarthik ghate main he
 As soon as he took the name of the BSP government, the BSP members present in the House started an uproar
 akhilesh ne kaha ki sarkaar kii ore se kanya vidya dhan yojana ek baar phir shuru kii jaaegi
 He said that the government has made a provision of Rs 1,100 crore for unemployment allowance, while Rs 2,721 crore has been made for laptops and tablets

 Leave the marriage, in 16 years, you cannot even see an adult category film but can make a relationship

 How much punishment is there in the anti-rape law passed by the group of ministers: - Life imprisonment for rape
 - tezaab phenkane par umr kaid
 - Life imprisonment on minor to rape
 lekin jo haahaakaari he wo ye ki is kanoon main zyaadaatar gunahon ko gairazmaanti bana diya gaya he
 - To stare would be non-bailable
 - peechha karnaa gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh kii shrenee main hoga
 - It is also illegal to stare at a woman
 - agar baar-baar chhintakashi kii to wo bhi gairazmaanti
 - Meaning if a man is stuck in a traffic jam and accidentally his car is behind a woman's car, then the woman can accuse him of stalking and he will not get bail
 - isi tarah aap kisi mahila ko pahchaanane kii koshish kar rahe hon or mahila ko ye pasand na aae to wo use 100 number dial karke andar kara sakati he
 - If a man, while working, sees a woman from time to time, then he is a partner of non-bailable offense
 or police ke liye mahila kaa bayaan aakiri hoga
 - The extent is that if the woman turns out to be false, then no action will be taken against her
 chhattisgarh main sanchaar kranti yojana (ski yojana) kaa laabh uthaane ke liye halaat kuch is tarah ke ban gaye hai ki har koi muft smart phone paane kii laalasaa kar rahaa he
 Actually, the government is going to provide smart phones for free under this scheme
 haalanki yah phone sirf bipiel pariwaron ko hi milegaa, lekin har ek varg ise paane kii chaah main juta hua he
 Under the Sky scheme, there has been an atmosphere of chaos in the Chhattisgarh about 50 lakh mobiles being distributed
 nagar nigamon ke jone daftaron se lekar nagar palikaon or gram panchayaton main smart phone ke liye maaramaari machi hui he
 In the process of getting a smart phone, consumers have to fill the application form
 iske liye yojana ke paatr hitgrahiyon tak form pahunche
 Already influential people are occupying the form
 form kabza karne vaale logon main ward parshadon, panch-sarpanchon or vidhayakon se lekar nigam mandalon ke adhyaksh tak shaamil hai
 Leaders of both BJP and Congress parties have become active to provide free smart phones to their supporters
 ye netaa nigam mandalon ke daftar, nagar palikaon or panchayaton ke daftar main din bhar deraa daale hue hai
 Let us know that in Chhattisgarh, BJP has played the stakes of smart mobile phones
 kai khoobiyon vaala yah smart phone 17 agast se vitarit hoga
 From urban areas to rural areas, this phone has created a boom
 darasal, is mobile phone se chah maah tak free outgowing kii suvidha he
 Not only this, two GB data per month is free and many such facilities have been given
 iske chalate ek badi aabaadi free main mobile paane ke liye kaaphi utsuk dikhaai de rahi he
 People have gathered from Panchayat offices to municipal corporations and municipalities to fill and submit forms

 Nowadays there is a debate on social media among people about a picture

 Are giving tough competition in every field
 abhi haal hi main aae sibiesai kii pariksha ke nateezon main bhi ek beti ne hi top kiya he
 In such a situation, seeing daughters as mere household chores is nothing but our patriarchal thinking
 purushon ko bhi ghar ke kaamkaaj main haath bataana chahie
 
 
 However, some people also say that this ad has been written keeping in mind those who are less educated and can understand the matter easily
 logon kaa maananaa he ki isi bahaane shaayad ve betiyon ko is duniya main aane kaa mauka den
 If the daughter is born then only there is scope for change
 duniyabar main asurakshit tareeke se hote hai 5
 6 crore abortions but this argument is nothing but a sophist
 har garbh main pal rahi beti kaa adhikaar he janm lenaa, kisi kii roti banane ke liye nahin balki sasamman jivan jeene ke liye
 The birth of a daughter should not be a matter of shame or a matter of pride
 yah bilkul saamaanya he
 Such ads not only promote patriarchal thinking but also discourage daughters

 The government has denied information about an Indian being surrounded in the ongoing mortgage crisis at a Sydney cafe
 sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki abhi is jaankaree kii koi pushti nahin hui he ki vahaan koi bhartiya fansaa he yaa nahin
 Earlier, Venkaiah Naidu, while talking to journalists in the Parliament House, had spoken of an Indian being trapped there
 yah bhi bataaya tha ki vah iti profeshnal he or videsh mantralay lagaataar australia main bhartiya ucchayog se sampark main he
 However, no such information has been given so far by the Ministry of External Affairs that there is an Indian among the hostages
 amuman yah videsh mantralay kii zimmedaariyon main hi aata he ki agar zarurat pade to kisi bhi bhartiya ke saath videsh main hone vaali kisi bhi tarah kii samasya se judi puri jaankaree ke saath saamne aae
 Before sharing any such information, the government also examines its profit-and-loss aspect, but in this case, Venkaiah has to withdraw his words as he is talking with the media with half-incomplete information
 bandhak sankat ek gambhir maamla he or kisi bhartiya ke vahaan ghire hone kii koi bhi jaankaree bharat ke liye is maamle kii sanvadenshiltaa ko or badha detaa he
 In such a case, with the presence of an Indian identity, he may come first on the target of a terrorist, so Venkaiah may have told the news as unconfirmed, but it is impossible to control any information coming out of the mouth in this era of media and social media
 
 rajasthan menswine flumahamari kaa rup letaa ja rahaa he
 So far, 226 people have died in the state due to the disease spreading continuously

 The government claims that 17 shops have been licensed to sell the disease-resistant drug Temi Flu, but when the team till date reviewed these shops, it was found that there is no Tami Flu available at these shops
 team alag alag sarkari aspataalon ke dukaanon main bhi pahunchi to vahaan ke halaat bhi kuch vaise hi the
 Many shops did not even have masks
 sarkari aspataal ke adhikariyon se jab is babat poocha gaya to unka jawaab tha ki philhal mask kii kami he or dawa ke abhaav kii vajah se logon ko dukaan se dawa nahin mil paa rahi he
 a team from Delhi has also been called to fight this disease
 vasundhara raaje ne iske liye ek task force bhi banaaya he jo puure maamle par najar rakhe hue he
 However, the truth is that the government department is awake late in the case
 maut kaa aankada jab badhane laga tab jaakar sarkaar kii neend tuuti he
 But despite all this, lack of medicines is a serious issue
 dawaaon kii kami agar aisi hi bani rahi to is beemaari se jujh rahe logon ke liye ye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he

 In the monsoon session of Parliament, proceedings were stalled due to the uproar caused by bjp's demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the allocation of coal blocks
 monsoon satr ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki alag alag raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ko matbhed sulajhane kii pranali par kaam karnaa chahie or sunishchit karnaa chahie ki sansad main kaamkaaj ho sake
 He recalled that in the past too, a whole session (2010 winter session due to JPC demand) was destroyed

 The comments unhone kaha, ‘‘chunaav kaise honge, yah bahut kuch anek pahaluon par nirbhar karata he
 Whenever the government falls in a state in the constitution, elections will have to be held within six months or if there is presidential rule, it cannot take more than a year

 unhone yaad karte hue kaha ki pehle bhi ek puraa satr (jepisi kii maang ko lekar 2010 kaa sheetakaaleen satr) barabaad ho gaya
 When asked about the suggestions of senior BJP leader LK Advani for holding elections to the Lok Sabha and state assemblies at one time, Pranab said that the decision has to be taken by political parties as different states are running governments in different states
 tippaniyan He said, "how elections will be held depends a lot on many aspects
 samvidhan main jab bhi kisi rajya main sarkaar gir jaati he to chah maheene ke andar chunaav karaane honge yaa agar raashtrapati shashan he to ek saal se zyada samay nahin laga sakate

 Until this is decided how is it possible

 Kejriwal, who left the job of IRS and started on the path of social reform, was initially joined by big social workers like Anna Hazare, but on the political path, Kejriwal soon made his own place in the national politics of the country
 2019 ke chunaav main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ekajute hue vipaksh main arvind kejariwal ek ahm cheharaa hai
 When political ambitions arose, Kejriwal did a lot of work for the 'right to Information' while continuing to do social work separate from Anna
 janalokapal bill ke liye unhone samajasevi anna hajaare ke saath andolan kiya
 Legendary people like Shanti Bhushan, Prashant Bhushan, Santosh Hegde, Kiran Bedi joined his movement
 'india against karpshan' ke binar tale aisa andolan khadaa hua jisane dilli ke hukmaranon kii chulein tak hilaa di
 Meanwhile, political ambitions arose in Kejriwal's mind
 kejariwal samajasevi kaa chola utarkar raajnneeti ke akhaade main kud gaye
 Janlokpal movement became turning point For Kejriwal, this movement proved to be the turning point of his life
 anna kii chhatrachhaaya main viraat swaroop lete andolan ko 'hijank' karne kaa kejariwal par aarope lagane laga
 Realizing Kejriwal's intentions, Anna separated her path from him
 lekin raajnneetik pari khilne kii thaan lene vaale kejariwal ne apane sapane ko paravaan chadhaane ke liye 2 oktober 2012 ko aam aadmi party kaa gathan kar liya
 People like Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh joined Kejriwal's party, but later he became disenchanted with Kejriwal and made his way like Anna

 Kejriwal himself defeated Sheila Dikshit, the Chief Minister of Delhi, by a huge margin
 congress ke samarthan se kejariwal ne 49 dinon kii sarkaar chalaane ke baad istipha de diya
 After a year, when elections were held again, Kejriwal came back strongly and won 67 out of 70 seats
 iske saath hi kejariwal 14 farvari 2015 ko duusari baar dilli ke mukhyamantri bane
 This is Kejriwal's family
 Kejriwal was the eldest of three siblings born on August 16, 1968 in Sewani village in Hisar district, Haryana
 unke pita kaa naam govind or mata kaa naam gita he
 Kejriwal's wife's name is Sunita
 sunita bhi iares adhikari rah chuki hai
 After her husband became the Chief Minister, she has taken voluntary retirement ie VRS
 unke bacchon kaa naam harshitha or pulakit he
 Kejriwal worked like a common Hindustani after taking a degree in mechanical engineering from IIIT Kharagpur while leaving his IRS job while doing social service
 tata steel main naukari karne ke dauraan hi saal 1992 main unka chayan iares main ho gaya
 But Kejriwal was also associated with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity, Ramakrishna Mission and Nehru Yuva Kendra along with the job
 baad main kejariwal naukari chhodkar puri tarah saamaajik kaary karne lage
 He started a movement called 'parivartan'
 isamen unhone dilli or uske aasapaas ke ilaakon main bacchon kii shiksha or unke surakshit bhavishya ke liye kaam kiya
 To maintain transparency in government work, Kejriwal did a commendable job at the grassroots level for the right to information
 iske liye kejariwal saal 2006 main magsaysay puraskaar se bhi navaaje ja chuke hai
 There is no alliance with the Congress, there are seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, which is to be voted on May 12 in the sixth phase

 Actress Dhansika, who plays superstar Rajinikanth's daughter in the film Kabali, was publicly accused in a press conference
 unhen is kadar beizzat kiya gaya ki wo ro padin
 Actually, her fault was that she had missed the name
 maamla thriller tamil film ‘bijithiru’ kii press conference ke dauraan kaa he
 Dhansika was present with the rest of the star cast of the film
 isi dauraan unhone film main apane ko-stars or kru kaa dhanyavaad kiya
 But she forgot to say the name of T
 Rajendra in her Thanks Message
 singer or mujeec compoger tii rajendra vahaan maujuud the
 He was so enraged that Dhansika started lecturing on 'dignity'
 khud ko piem modi kii beti bataa chuki he ye actress, is film main ai thim najarayaha tak ki dhamsika ne tii rajendra ke paanv chhu kar apni galati kii maafee maangi or kaha ki vah unki dil se izzat karti hai
 She forgot to speak his name by mistake
 dhamsika ne baar-baar unase maafee maangi, lekin tii rajendra yahi kehete rahe ki unhen ye bhi nahin pataa kii kisi ko sammaan kaise diya jaataa he?
 
 
 The extent was reached when T
 Rajendra gave a lecture on decorum and commented even on Dhansika's clothes
 unhen sari nahin pahanakar aane ke liye bhi tii rarjendra ne saream khari khoti sunai
 t Rajendra's anger over Dhansika was not ending, he was constantly lashing out the actress
 ye dekhakar dhamsika khud ko sambhaal nahin pai or unki ankhon se aansu bahane lage
 Film review: 'kabali' for Rajinikanth's fans, the most surprising thing was that a person associated with the film, who was present there, did not stop t Rajendra and no one kept him silent when he was presented in front of the media filled with an actress
 Asked to do
 balki is vaakye ke jari video main dekhen to jab tii rajendra dhamsika kaa majaak bana rahe the to film kii baaki cast is makhul par muskura rahi thi
 This film can compete with Bahubali, earned 50 crores on the first day, but now Tollywood fans and many actors have come in support of Dhansika, seeing this matter
 jiske chalate dhamsika ne apane phans ke is kadam ke liye twitor par unka shukriya adaa bhi kiya he
 I'm really obliged to d no of ppl 4showing their care and luv 4 me, for what happened to me
 But it is a pity, this is state of lone women
 
 — saidhanshika (@saidhanshika)september 29, 2017bataa den ki tii rajendra se judaa hua ye koi pehla vivaad nahin hai
 He is known for similar behavior in Tollywood
 isse pehle vah tamil film 'romeo jiolit' ke mekars ko unki aawaaj kaa majaak udaane par legal notice bhej chuke hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Muslims of the state are closely watching the ongoing feud between the ruling party and the Yadav family
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or samaajawaadee party ke pradesh adhyaksh shivpal yadav ke bich jo tana-tani chal rahi he usko dekhte hue upi ke musalmaan philhal kuch duvidha kii stithi main hai
 In 2012, Muslim voters played an important role in bringing the Samajwadi Party to power
 lekin samaajawaadee party main chal rahi aapasi jang ke baad musalmaan ye dekh rahe hai ki iskaa kya ant hota he
 Mohammad Arshad Farooqui, the Mufti of Deoband, believes that because of this fight two sunsets are being created
 ek to ye ki is foot kaa phayda bijepi ko ho saktaa he kyonki musalmaan voton main bantwaare kii sambhaavna bad sakati he
 Secondly, seeing these socialist parties weakening, they can go with Bahujan Samaj Party, the main opposition party of the state
 taaki bijepi ko satta main aane se roka ja sake
 Mufti Arshad believes that 'the political persuasion of the province is very dangerous and Muslims are keeping an eye on it
 'muslim samaaj ne basapa kii saraahna keedevband ke hi ek urdu akhbaar ke patrkaar samir choudhary bhi maanate hai kismajawaadee partimen bikharaav kii vajah se musalmaan duvidha main zarur hai
 We are in a strange situation
 soobe ke musalmaan ko aisi stithi main samaajawaadee party ke saath jaakar nuksaan na uthaanaa pade
 Sameer believes that in such a situation, the Bahujan Samaj Party can benefit the most because the BSP has made a lot of efforts in the last few years to bring the Muslims closer
 muslim muddon par party ab raay kaaphi had tak saafe karne lagi he
 The Muslim society is appreciating Mayawati's statement on the recent triple talaq and uniform civil code
 bahujan samaaj party ko hoga foot kaa phaaydadesh ke sabase bade or puraane islamic idaare daarul ulum, devband ke kai chaatro ne khulkar apni raay saajha kii
 One student is Mo
 asadullah kehete hai ki 'samaajawaadee partike saath to ye hona hi tha, inpar ye allaah kii maar he
 Because in the Bihar Assembly elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav broke away from the alliance and because of this, BJP benefited many places there and increased their seats
 mulaayam singh yadav ne dhokaa diya
 There is no difference between BJP and Samajwadi Party
 is foot kaa phayda safataur par bahujan samaaj party ko hoga
 If the Congress fights with the BSP, victory is theirs
 ek or chaatr hamaza ne kaha 'sabase zyada sampradayik dange samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar main hue
 The condition of Muslims and Dalits in the state is very bad
 isliye is jhagade se musalmaan bahujansamaajawaadee partiki taraf dekh rahaa he
 Some students have also told openly that they have made up their mind as to who to vote for
 mau se aakar devband madrase main padhai kar rahe mo
 Khutiba said that the BSP has to vote
 wo musalamaanon ke haq main hoga
 'on the other hand, supporters of the Samajwadi Party were troubled by the ongoing war in the party
 aise hi ek samarthak najam kuraishi ke mutabik 'aapas main jis tarah lard rahe hai isse sampradayik takat jeet jaaegi
 Fight off
 isi tarah haalat rahe to musalmaan basapa ke paas chale jaaenge
 Najam Qureshi says that Akhilesh Yadav's mood is no less and if the party fights with all its heart at once, the loss is still not significant
 ladaai main shivpal hai vilandevband ke kai log jo samaajawaadee party ke samarthak hai, wo puri tarah akhilesh yadav ke haq main baat karte bhi mili
 They believe that Villan Shivpal is in this fight
 aise hi ek samarthak mo
 Abid said that there is no dispute
 jahaan 2 bartan hote hai, aawaaj to hoti hi he
 No party did as much as Samajwadi Party and Akhilesh did for Muslims
 'musalamaanon ko akhilesh par he bharosakul milakar pradesh main tasviir abhi bhi puri tarah saaf nahin he
 Akhilesh Yadav's image is very strong
 musalmaan un par bharosa kar rahe hai
 The party may have been harmed by the arrogance, but still Muslims have not fully made up their mind
 itnaa zarur he ki samaajawaadee party main takaraar jitna jaldi band ho jaae utana uske liye behatar he
 Otherwise the BSP can benefit from it

 Documents present in the Ministry of Defense show that General Singh was born in 1950 and accordingly Singh, who became the Chief of Army Staff in March 2010, is to retire in May of this year

 Shashikant has gone to Malaysia on an official tour
 umr vivaad masale par raksha mantralay kii yojana kya he, is bare main sarkaar ne koi byoraa dene se inkaar kiya he
 When the army chief dragged the government to court on the issue, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni said, "if anyone feels that he has not got justice, he has the right to get justice and it is the right of all Indians
" ' unhone keval itnaa kaha, 'yadi vah adaalat gaye hai to main is par pratikriya nahin de sakati
 He also said, 'it is very difficult to make it an issue or controversy and i am afraid of it
 sainya balon ke saath ham hameshaa sammanjanak vyavhaar karte hai
 Earlier in the age dispute, General Singh had filed a statutory complaint in the Ministry of Defense requesting to correct the year of his birth in the official records to 1951 instead of 1950
 lekin mantralay ne disambar main ise khaarij kar diya tha, jiske baad somvaar ko unhone adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 This is the first time in the history of the country after independence that an army chief has gone to court against the government while in service
 hit and ran cese mensalmaan khanko bari kiye jane ke khilaaf maharashtra sarkaar agle hafte supreme court main special live petishan (SLP) daayar kar sakati he
 The government had already informed that it would appeal against the decision of the High Court in the Upper Court
 kanoon or nyaay vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki sarkari vakeelon ko SLP daayar karne ke sambandh main nirdesh jari kiye gaye hai
 He said, 'the state government will appeal against the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court
 ek hafte main SLP daayar kar di jaaegi
 'the decision can be given in 90 days' challenge Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had already announced that he would appeal against the acquittal of Salman Khan
 kanoon ke mutabik, hoicourt kaa faisla kaa aane ke 90 dinon ke andar use chunauti di ja sakati he
 The High Court refused to rely on the statement that Salman Khan was awarded the Bombay High Court Justice a in the Hhit and Run case in Mumbai in 2002 on December 10 last year
 aar
 Joshi acquitted Salman Khan for lack of evidence
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki maamle kii sunwaayee main nichali adaalat ne consteble rabindra patil ke bayaan ko mana tha lekin hai court ne is par bharosa karne se inkaar kar diya
 While giving the verdict, Justice Joshi had questioned the police investigation as well as the role of the investigation team for taking blood samples and delaying their investigation

 varsh 1984 main jackieur-rahamaan lakhvi ne kuch mutthibhar pakistani ahal-e-haddees anuyaayiyon ko afghanistan main soviet sena ke khilaaf jehad chhedgaye ke liye jutaya
 a year later, two professors of the Department of Islamic Studies at Lahore Engineering University & Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and Zafar Iqbal, a small group of jamaat-ud-dawa, mainly focused on Tablig or Dawa for the purpose of propagating ahl-e-hadith Formed
 1986 main lakhvi ne apane jihadiyon ko jamaat-ud-daawa main milakar marakaj daavat-ul-irshaad kaa gathan kiya
 Markaz had three tasks & Jehad, spreading the ahl-e-hadith Maslak and creating a new generation of Muslims committed to the ideology
 saal bhar main hi marakaj ne apana pehla jehadi training camp afghanistan ke pakatia soobe main sthapit kar diya&muaskar-e-taiyaba
 The second camp & muaskar-e-aqsa was established in Kunar
 soviet fouj ke afghanistan se laut jane ke baad vahaan alag-alag guton ke mujahidin ke bich ghaatak aapasi jang chhid gai
 Markaz was not happy with this and turned his attention to Indian Kashmir
 iske liye usne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main kai training camp sthapit kiye
 In 1990, Markaz launched his first mission in Kashmir when his fighters ambushed a jeep going towards Srinagar airport in which Indian Air Force personnel were on board
 kashmiri aatankwaadiyon ke bhartiya suraksha balon par hamale 1990 tak aam ho chuke the, lekin tab tak is kadar achook hamalaa apratyaashit tha
 In the early 1990s, Markaz separated his activities and organizational structure
 usne jamaat ke prachaar-prasar kaa kaam to jari rakhaa lekin lashkare taiyaba ke naam se ek alag aatanki gut khadaa kar liya
 However, Saeed was rich in both branches and had so much control over both that it was almost impossible to differentiate between Markaz and Lashkar
 lashkar ko iesai kii shahpakistani fouj or uski khufia agency inter-services intelegence (iesai) ne lashkare taiyaba kaa gathan to nahin kiya tha lekin use is baat kaa yakeen jarur tha ki lashkar ke paas jo majboot takat he, usase vah kashmir main halaat bigaad sakati he or baghawat kaa dayera badha sakati he
 That is why from the early 1990s, the ISI and the army put a lot of emphasis behind Lashkar
 khaas taur par bharat ke khilaaf istemaal karne ke liye lashkar kii takat ko khadi kii gai
 Lashkar's military training system was also repaired
 lashkar ke prashikshakon ke liye lashkar ke addon main faujee jawan tainaat kiye gaye
 The same method has continued till now
 khud said samet sabhi ke iesai main koi na koi aakaa hai
 The costs that Pakistan spent on Lashkar were soon visible
 kuch hi saal main lashkare taiyaba kashmir main bhartiya suraksha balon ke liye sabase badi chunauti ban gaya
 In 1999, Lashkar started speaking of a new type of attack in Indian Kashmir: the suicide attack
 in fidaayin hamalon kii madad se lashkar or uske pakistani hukmran bhartiya kashmir main teen saal se aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main ai giravat ko palat dena chaahate the
 Lashkar's suicide missions were not "suicide attacks" but were high-risk missions in which fully trained commandos preferred to land in direct combat and die rather than get caught
 pabandi kaa dhokhsambar 2001 main jaish-e-mohammad ke bhartiya sansad par hamale ke baad pakistan ne kai anya aatankwaadi guton ke saath-saath lashkar par bhi pabandi laga di
 After this attack, there was a war in India and Pakistan
 lekin in paabandiyon ke jhaanse main koi nahin aayaa
 Pakistan's intelligence agencies had already warned militant groups about the ban, allowing all of them to transfer their money to new accounts and become active under the new name
 lashkar ke maamle main said ne elaan kiya ki sanghathan ko punargathit kiya gaya he or vah ab jamaat-ud-daawa ke naam se kaam karegaa
 Since then, the Government of Pakistan has not made any pretense of further banning the organization
 usne aisa karne ke america, britain, europea sangh, bharat or sanyukt raashtra ke sabhi dabaavon ko darkinar kar diya he
 Even after the bloody attack on military school children in Peshawar in December 2014, when the Pakistani authorities vowed that they would no longer make any difference between good and bad terrorists, there was no threat to Lashkar (aka jamaat-ud-dawa) Hovering
 pakistani hukmran use “aatankwaadi” maanate hi nahin hai
 In fact, Saeed even claimed that the Peshawar attack was the handiwork of Indian agents and Lakhvi, the mastermind of the November 2008 Mumbai attack, was granted bail immediately after the attack
 lakhvi 2008 ke baad se hi jail main tha
 It was a kind of safe custody
 jehad ke nae rastelshkar ne 2005 tak apane kader ko is baat kii ijaajat de di thi ki afghanistan jaakar america fouj se lard rahe afgaan taliban kaa saath den
 The Lashkar cadre, however, was not overjoyed as it feared that a greater hand in Afghanistan's rebellion would mean working within and with various Deobandi groups who were also fighting against Pakistan
 lashkar ne afgaan ladaai main kai kaarnon se dakhal diya
 First, Pakistan was forced to stop its vicious cycle in Kashmir following the Jaish attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001 and then the Lashkar attack on Indian Army families in Kaluchak (kashmir) in 2002
 america dabaav main general parvej musharraf ne tathakthith “chote jehad” kii ranneeti apanaai jisamen lashkar va anya jehadi guton ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 Therefore, the organizations which wanted to keep the militants and experienced commanders in their ranks to get into the field, saw Afghanistan as a good ground
 duusare, pakistan ke kai aatankwaadiyon ke liye afghanistan main kafiron se jang ladgaye kaa ehsaas zyada aakarshak tha or kai devbandi sanghathanon kii tarah lashkar bhi iske aage jhuk gaya
 Third, many donors of the organization believed that Afghanistan had now become a more important platform than Kashmir after its capture by American and international forces
 chauthe, america suraksha chhatari ke tale bharat ne afghanistan main kaaphi majboot maujuudagi bana lee thi jo pakistan ke liye nirantar koft kii baat thi
 And most importantly, the ISI also approved the role of the organization in Afghanistan so that Lashkar, along with the Haqqani network there, would become an important force to attack Indian and international military bases in Afghanistan
 lashkar kii gharelu raajnneetilshkar ke zyaadaatar jaankaar is sanghathan ko aise aatankwaadi sanghathan ke taur par maanate hai jiskaa istemaal pakistan bharat main or haal main afghanistan main apane hiton ko surakshit rakhane ke liye karata he
 However, Lashkar also has a growing and important role within Pakistan and is the only organization that can ideologically oppose the violent Deobandi agenda against the Pakistani polity
 pakistan main jin guton ne tabaahi failaa rakhi he, ve devbandi hai or devbandi hi pakistan main zyaadaatar sampradayik hamale karte hai
 The jamaat-ud-dawa opposes the attack on Pakistanis and in this sense it is an important tool in the hands of the rulers who are trying to compete with the Deobandi Jamaats who have stood against the state
 hairaani kii baat he ki kshetreey va antarrashtriya suraksha ko usase pesh aa rahe gambhir khatre ke baavjood is sanghathan ke dhaanche ke bare main koi pramanik jaankaree saarvajanik rup se uplabdh nahin he
 The number of its active cadres is also estimated between a few thousand to a maximum of fifty thousand
 said sanghathan kaa mukhiya he
 He maintains strict control over the organization which is divided into several departments
 ye vibhaag jehad, shiksha, daan, majahabi maamlat or janakalyaan hai
 For maximum compliance with his orders, Sayeed holds key family members or close associates who are directly accountable to him
 sanghathan par kadaa niyantran or khaas logon kii pramukh jagahon par tainaati hi is baat kii vajah he ki kyon is sanghathan main us tarah kii tanatani or natijatan rajya ke khilaaf baghawat dekhne ko nahin mili he jaisi ki un vibhinn devbandi guton main rahi he jinhone apane kaman or niyantran dhaanche ko kai logon main baanta hua tha
 Sajid Mir is the commander of his foreign affairs
 vah 2008 main kukhyat hua tha kyonki vah 2008 ke mumbai hamalon kaa “project manager” tha
 He was personally directing the Mumbai attack and was in constant phone contact with the attackers, due to his strong interception within Pakistan
 bhartiya kashmir main bhi is gut kaa ghati ke liye ek mukhya oparation commander or madhya, uttar va dakshin divijanon ke liye kshetreey diviginal commander hai
 Then there is also a small command at the neighborhood level
 kaise hota he kharch kaa intjamjamaat-ud-daawa praathmik rup se apane fund kaa istemaal teen uddeshyon ke liye karata haih daawa, khidamat or jehad sambandhi gatividhiyon (bhartee, prashikshan or hathiyaaron kii kharid) ke liye
 But there is no way to know exactly how much the operating budget of the group is and how much of it comes directly from the state and how much is collected from the organization's own money raising activities
 anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki lashkar kaa kul salanaa parichaalan bajet lagbhag 5 karod dollar kaa he jisamen lagbhag 52 lakh dollar sainya gatividhiyon par kharch kiye jate hai
 With this operating budget, the organization operates several training centers across Pakistan
 yah bhi anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki sanghathan apana basic course daura-e-aam karne vaale harek par 330 dollar or advance teen maheene kaa course daura-e-khaas karne vaale harek par 1,700 dollar kaa kharch karata he
 It is unlikely that the government will have to provide its full operating expenses because it is funded by donations from domestic and foreign donor organizations, by online donations, by the sale of many of its publications, by the sale of imported animal skin and all other means
 The fund-raising group has strong capabilities
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki pakistan kii sangheey or uske punjab soobe kii sarkaar gut ko paroksh rup se madad uplabdh karaati hai jabaki sanyukt raashtra or america ne use aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 In India, Lashkar is still the most prominent terrorist group in South Asia
 sanghathanaatmak rup se uskaa al kaayda yaa uske pratispardhi islamic state (ies) ke saath koi talmail nahin he
 In fact, joining hands with any of these organizations will jeopardize their most important support, and that is the unbridled support of Pakistani rule
 haalanki ies ne apni hinsa kii bhayavahata ko kaaphi badhaayaa he lekin al kaayda or lashkar samanvit, bahusthaleey ek saath hamale bolne ke sandarbh main hameshaa duniya ko chaunkaate rahe hai
 To remain at the center of the Islamic State media is so vandalizing that even the Taliban and al Qaeda have called IS a barbaric savage who tarnishes the name of Islam
 lekin uski isi barbarta ne anya aatankwaadi guton par bhi barbarta badhaane ke liye manovaigyanik dabaav banaaya he
 After all, all Islamic terrorist groups are vying for their share of funds and cadres
 kuch maamalon main to ies ne yah dikhaa diya he ki use kisi ke madad kii jarurat nahin he, vah apni barbarta se logon ko majaboor karne main yakeen karata he
 On the strength of his strength, he has established his empire of terror in his occupied territories
 uski is misaal se is baat kii prabal ashanka bhi he ki lashkar bhi apni krurta main ijapha kar saktaa he
 After all, it has a long history of beheading people
 islamic state kii barbarta se hode karnaa yaa usase aage nikal janaa lashkar kii haisiyat ke daayre main hi he
 He can do it if he wants, but the question is whether Pakistani rulers will allow it
 bharat yah akalan sahi ho saktaa he ki us par aglaa hamalaa lashkar kii taraf se ho saktaa he lekin mere anumaan se bharatiyon ko jaish ko bhi yaad rakhana chahie, jisane bhartiya sansad par hamalaa bolaa tha
 Jaish has been inactive for years as most of its cadres have moved into the Pakistani Taliban camp
 haal ke varshon main pakistani fouj or iesai ne jaish main phir se jaan foonkane kii koshish kii he or uske tatkaaleen kaadaron ko bharatiyon ko maarane kaa laalach dikhaakar phir se idhar laane kii koshish kii he
 It can be reminded here that Jaish carried out his first attack & suicide bombing in 2000 in Kashmir itself
 or lashkar ke vipareet uske al kaayda or afgaan taliban se lambey rishte rahe hai, jo ek samay main duniyabar main barbarta main sabase aage rahe hai
 Some of the Jaish terrorists are also working with the Pakistani Taliban
 bharat ke liye yah samajhadaari hi hogi ki vah lashkar ke alaava jaish par bhi najar rakhe
 The Pakistani army and the ISI will need both these groups if it is to pursue its dual objective of keeping Pakistan calm and setting fire to India

 Input - IANS chalati bas main samuhik balaatkaar kii shikaar ladki ko ilaaj ke liye singapore bheje jane ko lekar uthte sawaalon ke bich, safadarajang aspataal main uskaa ilaaj karne vaale dal ke pramukh doctor tathaa peedit ke saath air ambulance main gaye anya doctoron ne is faisle kii aalochanaon ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki unka iraadaa kisi bhi surat main ladki ko bachaana tha
 Superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, Dr
 BD Athani, said that it is not the time to argue whether the decision to send the victim to Singapore was on political grounds or medically
 unhone kaha, ekmaatr or sirf ekmaatr iraadaa har surat main uski jaan bachaane kaa tha
 The whole nation was praying for her and everyone hoped that she would recover
 ham ummid nahin tyaag sakate the
 We wanted to save his life
 medanta medicity hospital ke chikitsa visheshgy dow yatin mehta ne kaha ki vah peedit ko singapore bhejne ke faisle kii aalochana se aashcharyachakit hai
 In response to the criticisms, Dr
 Mehta said, "often doctors criticize the decisions of other doctors and this is not true
" unhone kaha ki marij singapore ke aspataal main 48 ghante jivit rahi or yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki use vahaan nahin bheja janaa chahie tha
 Dr Mehta said, secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore
 main doctoron kii kushalta ke bare main nahin, balki buniyadi suvidhaon ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 We should know this
 dow athani ne kaha ki peedit kii aant or anya angon main atyant gambhir chotein thim
 He said, we had removed a large part of his bowel due to infection
 jo chotein thim, vah atyant gambhir kism kii thim
 Athani said that the girl's condition was stable for the first five days after treatment and there were signs of improvement, but her condition worsened due to sepsis (blood transfusion)
 doctor ne kaha, uski ichhashakti prabal thi or usne police ko do bayaan die
 She was conscious
 athani ne kaha ki para-medical kii chaatra kaa safadarajang aspataal main or hawaii ambulance se singapore ke mount elizbeth medical centre le jane ke baad vahaan bhi behtareen ilaaj kiya gaya
 The hospital in Singapore is known for having multiple organ transplant facilities
 athani ne kaha ki bharat se abhinayta rajnikant or raajnneetijna amar singh jaisi jaani-maani hastiyaan vahaan ilaaj ke liye gayi or thik ho kar lauti hai
 Dr
 Mehta said that the girl's condition deteriorated more there than in Delhi
 unhone kaha, hamane shuukravaar ko dilli ravaanaa hone se pehle usase mulaakaat kii thi
 His condition was worse than in Delhi
 use bahut gambhir chotein ai thim or hamane use bachaane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiye
 Mehta also said that the decision was taken to take the victim from Hawaii ambulance to Singapore as the hospital is one of the best hospitals for organ transplantation
 ek or mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki uski jaan bachaana sabase pehla uddeshy tha
 Dr
 Athani said, she was a very brave girl
 unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron ne uski gambhir haalat ko dekhte hue use bachaane ke prayaason main koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin uski choton kii prakruti aisi thi ki use bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 Dr
 Athani said, even extremely serious patients with such injuries are admitted to the ICU and many of them survive
 yah ek atyant gambhir maamla tha
 The comments unhone kaha ki safadarajang aspataal ke doctoron, nurson or para-medical staff ne sachmuch kadaa parishram kiya
 It also got its reward and she was able to survive for at least 12 days after being brought here in a critically injured state on the night of 16 December
 chauthe din se uski haalat bigadane lagi
 She did not recover at all after the third operation
 uski chetana kaa str bhi kam ho gaya tha
 Dr
 Athani said that he had expressed his intention to fight and live with the situation
 uski zyaadaatar baatcheet uski maa ke saath hoti thi
 After the first three days, it seemed that she would recover
 dow mehta ne kaha, safadarajang aspataal se nikalate samay uski haalat bahut kharaab ho chuki thi
 He was very badly injured
 uski aant kaa koi bhi bhaag acchhee haalat main nahin tha
 Why was the victim sent to a hospital in Singapore? is par dow mehta ne kaha, vahaan kaa aspataal duniya ke is hisse ke behtareen aspataalon main se ek he or vahaan ke doctoron ke saath meri kai baar baatcheet hui
 i have seen the facilities and equipment there myself
 safadarajang aspataal ke suparintendent dow bidi athani ne kaha ki yah samay is baat ko lekar bahes karne kaa nahin he ki peedit ko singapore bhejne kaa faisla raajnneetik aadhaar par tha yaa chikitsakeey aadhaar par
 He said, the only and only intention was to save her life in every face
 puraa desh uske liye prarthana kar rahaa tha or har vyakti ko ummid thi ki vah thik ho jaaegi
 We could not give up hope
 ham uski jaan bachaana chaahate the
 Medical expert Dr Yatin Mehta of Medanta Medicity Hospital said that he was surprised by the criticism of the decision to send the victim to Singapore
 aalochanaon par pratikriya main dow mehta ne kaha, aksar doctor duusare doctoron ke faisle kii aalochana karte hai or yah sahi nahin he
 He said that the patient survived 48 hours in a hospital in Singapore and it cannot be said that he should not have been sent there
 dow mehta ne kaha, duusari baat yah he ki bharat main sarkari aspataalon or singapore ke mount elizbeth aspataal ke bich koi tulana nahin he
 i am not talking about the efficiency of doctors, but about basic facilities
 hamen yah pataa hona chahie
 Dr
 Athani stated that the victim had extremely serious injuries to the intestine and other organs
