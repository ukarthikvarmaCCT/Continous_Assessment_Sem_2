 varna sach to ye he ki dilli ke gangster sadakon or postaron se uth kar ab soshal media par ja chipke hai
 Have started marketing fear and panic
 niraj bavania, tillu tajpuria or gogi gangster se na jane kitne hi apradhi in dinon soshal media main active hai
 Seeing their hanging, painting, firing and style there may be deceived to be the hero, model or junior artist of a small music album
 lekin kabhi shot gan, kabhi pistal, kabhi goliyon ke zakhire or kabhi hai and kaaron ke saath fasebuk se lekar you-tub jaise soshal plateform par chaaye rahane vaale ye noujvaan naa to kisi album ke hero hai, naa model or naa hi koi junior artist
 Rather, they are Delhi's gangsters who talk about bloodshed
 in logon ne ab soshal media par khoff or dehshat kii marketing shuru kar di he
 The marketing that continues to be carried out even when they are outside and continues in jail
 in gangstaron par qatl se lekar lutpaat or kidnaping se lekar dakaiti jaise tamaam gunahon ke beshumaar ilzaam hai or inke sir par police ne koi hazaar-bees hazaar se lekar lakh-dedh lakh tak ke inaam kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 But still these gangsters neither appear nor hide under the pressure of anyone
 balki fasebuk se lekar utyub or yahaan tak ki kuch ke to twitor par bhi acount maujuud hai
 It is another matter that the police do not see this bus
 ab sabase pehle dilli ke sabase badnaam gangster niraj bavania kii soshal media main maujuudagi par hi nazar daaliye
 Neeraj Bawania has maintained not one, but two accounts and pages on Facebook
 inamen ek account main usne apni pahchaan public figure kii likhi he, jabaki duusare pej par politician
 But both the account shows the bullying and thrashing of the goons
 phir chaahe wo niraj kii tasveeron main ho, inamen share kiye gaye video yaa phir likhi gai linon main
 First of all, the background pick that Neeraj Bawania has put in both of his accounts is a picture taken from his police-held low angle, which tries to make a gangster an image of larger than life
 thik isi tarah usne haal main hi main 12 june ko dopaher 12 bajkar 57 par ek video aplod kiya he
 This is a video shot from the top angle, in which the police have caught Neeraj Bawana in handcuffs and reached for a raid, and the entire street is filled with crowds of police and spectacles
 is video ke saath niraj bavana ne likhaa he
 "caravans do not stop just by giving voice, it is also seen who called
 "zaahir he, 12 june ko aplod kiya gaya ye video bataata he ki yaa to tihaad main band niraj apana account jail se hi oparate kar rahaa he yaa phir usne apane soshal media account ko manage karne ke liye baqayada kisi ko apanit kar rakhaa he
 There are many videos of him on youtube, in which he is seen in police custody, while partying somewhere
 jabaki takreeban har video ke becoground main punjabi gane baj rahaa he
 But this is the case of Bharati who was killed in the encounter and Neeraj who is lodged in jail
 dilli ke baaki gangster bhi soshal media par shekhi baghaarne ke maamle main kisi se peeche nahin hai
 Whether it is Neeraj's disciple Tillu Tajpuria or his enemy number one Gogi Gangster
 uttarakhand ke pithauragarh main hue ek sadak durghatana main 2 logon kii maut ho gai he, vahiin 6 anya gambhir rup se jakhmi bataae ja rahe hai

 40 to make a dangerous explosion Rs
 prati kilo kii dar se milane vaale do kilo ammonium nitrate se zyada kii jarurat nahin hoti
 The country was once again aware of how deadly this bomb filled with nails and nut bolts could be when 17 people died in the bomb blasts in Dilsukhnagar, Hyderabad on 21 February
 pichley ek dashak main mumbai, jaipur or pune main hue bam hamalon main 300 se adhik logon kii jaan gai he
 Ammonium nitrate has been used in all these bombings
 inamen sabase ghaatak mumbai upnagar rail network par july, 2006 main hue serial bam dhamaake the, jinamein 209 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Officials of intelligence agencies say that in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir camps, terrorists are trained to make bombs, but they are not given explosives
 khufia agency ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, ‘‘ab visphotakon main sthaneey str par jutaaye ja sakane vaale ammonium nitrate jaise padaarthon ke istemaal par jor diya ja rahaa he taaki pakistan in hamalon main apni bhoomika ko aasaani se nakaar sake
 "india declared ammonium nitrate as a special category of explosives in 2008, but it is still easily found
" pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan vibhinn rajyon kii police ne kai ton rasinic visphotak jabt kiya he
 The Rajasthan Police seized 100 kg of low density ammonium nitrate from Bhiwadi on 23 February
 ghaatak visphotak banane vaala yah padaarth deshbhar main kaam karne vaale saikadon dealron or pathar kii khadaanon, khaanon or sadak nirmaan karaane vaale thekedaaron ke paas maujuud he
 The country produces 4,00,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate annually
 maharashtra, andhra pradesh or gujarat kii companiyon main adhik ghanatv vaala 180,000 ton ammonium nitrate banaaya jaataa he jo sakht nigaraanee kii vajah se surakshit hota he
 But the real danger is due to low density ammonium nitrate
 iskaa istemaal udyogon main kiya jaataa he
 Bomb makers use low density ammonium nitrate more because it absorbs fuel oil easily
 ise dijal yaa anya kisi eendhan tel main 94 or 6 ke anupaat main milakar behad shaktishaalee ammonium nitrate tel visphotak (eenefo) banaaya ja saktaa he
 This IED is triggered by a battery-operated circuit and then detonated by connecting it to the pulverizer
 haalanki ise duusari shrenee kaa visphotak mana jaataa he (badi khaanon main istemaal hone vaale visphotak se ek kram neeche), lekin iskaa asar ghol vaale rasinic visphotakon kii tarah hi hota he
 The only manufacturer of such explosives in the country is Pune-based Deepak Fertilizer & and Petro Chemical
 in sabko regulate karne vaale chif controlar of explosive ke paas aisa koi rasta nahin he jisase vah eenefo jaise ghaatak visphoton ke kanoonee yaa gaiyr kanoonee nirmaan kii jaanch kar sake
 After the Jaipur blasts in September 2008, a working group constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs suggested that the licenses granted to the explosives be removed from the periphery of small scale industries and brought under the Industries Development Regulation Act, 1951
 tab license or nirmaan sthal ke liye grih mantralay se anumati lenaa anivaary ho jayega
 In December 2008, ammonium nitrate was declared a special category explosive under the Explosive Substances Act
 july, 2011 ise dimd visphotak ghoshit kiya gaya or iske nirmaan, sangrahan or dhulaai ke liye license anivaary bana diya gaya
 But then the rules and regulations have not been removed
 udyog ke sutron kaa kahana he ki eenefo jaise khatarnaak visphotak nirmaataa mantralay kii nigaraanee ke daayre se baahar hai
 The Intelligence Bureau and the Ministry of Home Affairs can ban the supply of ammonium nitrate through a multi-layered system of background checks of those using these explosives

 This is the reason why no senior player is part of the team except Mahendra Singh Dhoni, but does performance really matter on this tour? Do new players benefit from it? For the third time in the last 4 years, Team India is touring Zimbabwe, but for young players this tour is nothing less than a double-edged sword
 achche pradarshan ke baavjood team main jagah milti nahin or kharaab pradarshan par aalochana kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 The example is in front of 31-year-old Kedar Jadhav, who scored an outstanding 105 off 87 balls on the previous tour, but the selectors have since ignored him
 philhal har baar kii tarah is baar bhi daure par ja rahe yuva khilaadi team kaa hissaa hone par hi behad utsahit hai
 Uncapped player Mandeep Singh, who was included in the team for the Zimbabwe tour, says that i am very happy to be part of the team for this tour and the rest is my focus on going well there
 mandeep team main shaamil hone se khush hai to ek or ancaped khilaadi jayant yadav ke paas utsahit hone kii alag vajah he, "main to captain dhoni ke saath ek hi team kaa hissaa hone ko lekar hi behad utsahit hum
 " lekin vah khilaadi jo pehle bhi team india kaa hissaa rah chuke hai, unka maananaa he ki daura zimbabwe kaa ho yaa phir saamne koi bhi team ho ant main aapako acha pradarshan hi karnaa he
 Team India's reserve test opener Lokesh Rahul, who has also been included in the ODI and T20 teams after a great game in the IPL, says that "it matters how you play on the field
" 
 If you perform well, it does not matter whether you are performing against Zimbabwe or any other team
 
 This is a big challenge for all of us
 
 Any player will be happy with a century or 5 wickets, even if it is against Zimbabwe
 "tippaniyan At the same time, Dhawal Kulkarni, who has shown a great game in the IPL, admitted that this is a big opportunity for him
 unhone kaha ki This is a big opportunity for all of us and we have to go on the field and perform in the same way as we have been doing for the last few years
 aap kisi bhi team ko halke main nahin le sakate
 
 aapako vahaan jaakar pradarshan karnaa he, baaki bhagwaan par chhod do
 True, this tour is an opportunity for all youth
 mauka captain dhoni ke saath khilne kaa, unhen apane khel se prabhavit karne kaa
 Whether the performance is preferred here or not, there will definitely be a chance to present your claim by performing well
 udhaaharan 31 varshiya kedaar jadhav ke rup main sabake saamne he, jinhone pichley daure par 87 gend par shandaar 105 ran banaae the, lekin uske baad se chayankartaaon ne un par dhyaan nahin diya
 Like every time right now, the young players going on tour this time are very excited about being part of the team
 zimbabwe daure ke liye team main shaamil kiye gaye ancaped khilaadi mandeep singh kaa kahana he ki main is daure ke liye team kaa hissaa hone par behad khush hum or baaki vahaan jaakar acha pradarshan karne par meraa dhyaan he
 While Mandeep is happy to join the team, another uncapped player Jayant Yadav has a different reason to be excited, "I am very excited to be part of the same team with captain Dhoni
" " But the player who has been a part of Team India before also believes that the tour is of Zimbabwe or whatever team is in front, in the end you have to perform well
 team india ke reserve test openar lokesh rahul jinhen ipel main shandaar khel ke baad vanade or tii-20 team main bhi shaamil kiya gaya he unka kahana he ki " myne yah rakhata he ki aap maidan par jaakar kaisaa khele
 
 agar aap acha pradarshan karte hai to ye myne nahin rakhata ki aap zimbabwe yaa kisi or team khilaaf wo pradarshan kar rahe hai
 
 ye ham sabake liye badi chunauti he
 
 koi bhi khilaadi shatak yaa phir 5 wicket lekar khush hoga phir chaahe vah zimbabwe ke khilaaf hi kyon naa hon
 "comments vahiin ipel main shandaar khel dikhaane vaale dhaval kulkarni ne mana ki yah unke liye bada mauka he
 he said that yah ham sabake liye ek bada mauka he or hamen maidan par jaakar usee tarah pradarshan karnaa he jaisaa ki ham pichley kuch varshon se karte rahe hai
 You cannot take any team lightly
 
 You have to go there and perform, leave the rest to God

 YS Jaganmohan Reddy has announced the formation of a new party within 45 days after resigning from the Congress and the Lok Sabha
 congress ke purv saansad ne aaj apane grih kshetra pulivendula main apane samarthakon se kaha ki pradesh main 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav unke liye ‘sabase ahm pariksha’ kii ghadi hogi
 Jagan said, 'I will form my new party within 45 days
 
 Millions of people still have great reverence for my father YS Rajasekhara Reddy and admire his actions
 ’ jagan ne pichley somvaar ko congress or loksabhaa se istipha de diya tha
 He had alleged that the party leadership including Sonia Gandhi 'insulted' his family
 aaj kii baithak main jagan ne kaha ki andhra pradesh main 2014 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav unke liye ‘ahm pariksha kii ghadi’ honge
 He claimed that his father's supporters would support his party
 shahabuddin jail main band he
 But his coin started running again as soon as a new Grand Alliance government was formed
 pehle jail main mantri milane gaye
 Then RJD joined the Executive Committee of the party and now Shahabuddin's name is cropping up from electoral violence to murder
 patrkaar rajdev ranjan kii hatyakand main siwan ke mafia don shahabuddin kaa conection saamne aane se bihar main mahajangal raaj ke naare bhi gunjane lage hai
 Shahabuddin is jailed
 katl ke maamle main use umr kaid kii sajaa hui he
 But what is his status, he is now becoming clear
 halhi main jail main band shahabuddin ke saath nitish sarkaar ke alpsankhyak kalyaan mantri abdul gafoor dikhe gaye
 It is alleged that RJD MLA Harishankar Yadav was also present along with the minister on 6 March
 ye mulaakaat jail minial kii dhajjiyaan udaate jail suparintendent ke daftar main hui
 The lollipop of the investigation was handed over as soon as questions were raised on this meeting lekin isse ye saaf ho gaya ki siwan kaa ye mafia don jail main rahete hue bhi kya ahmiyat rakhata he
 Indeed, Shahabuddin is the face of the nexus between polytics and crime that started it
 kabhi bihar kii siyasat main shahabuddin kii tuuti bolti thi
 In Siwan, without the will of Shahabuddin, the leaf would not move
 gelmen rahete hue chunaav tak jeet gaya
 As soon as Lalu Yadav became the throne, his terror subsided somewhat
 murder cese main sajaa hote hi chunaav ladane par bhi roak lag gai
 But the murder of the journalist once reminded Siwan of Puraneshhabuddin
 is katl main bhi modes oprendi vahi purana he
 Now it remains to be seen whether Shahabuddin also comes under the wraps of investigation into the journalist murder case
 The situation is that Shahabuddin's name is cropping up in the panchayat elections too
 lekin sarkaar maun he

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne shuru se hi congress ko lekar kadaa rukh apana rakhaa he
 On the other hand, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav was soft about the Congress for the first four phases, but now he seems to be mixing voice in the tone of Mayawati
 ab wo puri tarah se bijepi ke saath-saath congress ko bhi nishane par le rahe hai
 Akhilesh says that the Congress is responsible for all the current problems and evils
 bijepi or congress main koi fark nahin he
 Akhilesh Yadav, in a special conversation with Aaj Tak's team, attacked the Congress fiercely and said that the Congress party and its leaders are completely confused
 unhone kaha ki congress teen rajyon mili jeet ke jashn main dubi rahi or apane sahyogi dalon ko bhul gai thi
 As a result, she failed to form an alliance
 sapa adhyaksh kehete hai ki soobe kii janata ke rukh ko bhaanpakar congress lagaataar apane statement badal rahi he
 The Congress is not getting the support of the public, hence they have to change their statements
 mujhe lagata he ki congress kanfayuj ho gai he
 Whatever problems are there today, no one but the Congress is responsible for it
 congress hi bijepi he or bijepi hi congress he
 However, Akhilesh Yadav refrained from commenting on Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 akhilesh yadav ke tevar main aae badlaav ke peeche sochi samajhi ranneeti he
 In fact, in the area where the Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP alliance, Congress and BJP are fighting the election battle with great force in the political struggle here
 inamen se kai siten aisi hai, jahaan congress ummidavaar ummidavaar kaaphi majboot maane ja rahe hai
 In fact, all the Lok Sabha seats of UP where voting is remaining are from Purvanchal area
 inhen kshetra kii siton kii jimmedaari congress main priyanka gandhi ke kandhon par he
 In such a situation, Priyanka is playing on the front-foot, due to which Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati have become alert
 congress mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi ne pichley dinon ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha tha, 'uttar pradesh main congress ne chun -chunakar ummidavaar utaare hai, jo jeetenge yaa phir bijepi kaa vot kaatenge
 On the same day, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, while addressing an election rally in Barambaki, said that the key to remote control of BSP President Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is with Narendra Modi
 sapa-basapa par narendra modi dabaav daal sakate hai, lekin mujh par nahin he

 Through 'detective Byomkesh Bakshi', an attempt has been made to bring the life of the characters of Bengali writer Sharadendu Bandyopadhyay to 'byomkesh Bakshi'
 dibaakar banerjee ne yashraj films ke saath milakar film kaa nirmaan kiya he
 The lead roles are played by Sushant Singh Rajput, Anand Tiwari, Swastika Mukherjee, Divya Menon and Neeraj Kabi
 is film main nirmaataa nirdeshak dibaakar banerjee ne azaadi se pehle 1942 ke kalakatta ko screen par utaarne kii koshish kii he
 In the film, Ajit ie Anand Tiwari goes to Detective Byomkesh requesting to find his missing father and then by investigating Byomkesh, he exposes a very big conspiracy
 yahi he kahani 'detective byomakesh bakshi' kii
 Now let's talk about the shortcomings and strengths of the film
 sabase pehle baat kaamiyon kii
 The film has a slow pace, so you need to watch it patiently
 film main jasusi zarur he lekin aap isse tej gati kii spai thriller film kii ummid naa rakhen, kyonki film apni hi raftaar se aage badhati he
 Had the background score been used a little more in the film, it would have been good and perhaps the film's pace would not have seemed much slower
 film banane ke dhang kii baat karen to ye mujhe ek dark film lagi jiske kaaran aap shaayad kai seens naa samaj paaen
 Many aspects of the film's story may seem confusing to you
 masalan, film ke khalanaayak ko police kyon nahin pakadaney aati? byomakesh kii jindagi main swaastika mukherjee yani anguri devi kii entry byomakesh ko bhatkaati he par phir vah use sach kyon bataati he, aise seens main shaayad aap dimagi taur par ulajh jaaen
 Several twists in the film reflect the writer's convenience
 yah to thim film kii khamiyaan ab baat khoobiyon kii
 The praise of cinematographer Nikos and the art director is needed here
 agar aapako tehraav vaali filmein pasand hai to shaayad aap ant tak film dekhte rahenge
 Sushant's work in the film is good
 baaki actors bhi parde par apana role bakhubi nibhaate hai
 Dibakar has coined the characters quite well in the film
 to agar aap 'detective byomakesh bakshi' ke fain hai to ye film aapke liye bani he
 3 stars from my side to the film

 The court wants to impose a fine on the petitioners Sajjan Kumar and Mahendra Singh, but the penalty is not being imposed because it will delay the decision in the 1984 riots case
 court pakshpaat nahin kar rahaa he, lihaaja yachikakarta ke is tarah ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 There is no merit in this petition, hence the court dismisses the petition

 On October 24, the court reserved its verdict in the case after hearing the CBI, the petitioners Sajjan Kumar and Mahendra Singh Yadav

 At the same time, the CBI had rejected Sajjan Kumar's argument that Sajjan Kumar was adopting such tactics to delay the hearing

 If it is considered treason to give slogans in support of Afzal Guru, then the crime of the BJP MLA who insulted the soldiers' wives at a very low level, should be considered at least a serious crime
 'shivasena ne bijepi kii tikhi aalochana jari rakhte hue kaha he, 'bijepi kii najar me jeenyu kaa netaa kanhaiya yah pakkaa deshadrohi he, par maharashtra ke bhaajapa ke vidhayak prashanth parichaarak bilkul deshadrohi nahin hai

 However, Nitish openly supported NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind for the presidency
 haalanki pichley kai maukon par nitish kumaar piem modi ke faislon kaa samarthan karte najar aae hai
 Significantly, Venkaiah Naidu will file his nomination on Tuesday

 pradesh congress adhyaksh madan mohan jha ke netritv main party ke netaa 3 farvari ko rahul gandhi kii janaakanksha raily kii taiyaari main jute hue hai
 It has its own separate public meeting of Congress after years in Patna
 is jansabha main zyada se zyada bheed jutaney ke liye 95 paryvekshak bihar ke 38 jilon main faile hue hai
 Chandan Yadav, AICC general secretary in-charge of Chhattisgarh, who is helping in the preparations for the Patna rally, says, "rahul has opened the knack of Narendra Modi as well as the NDA which is fully in fulfilling its big promises
 Have failed
 pradhanmantri ke vikaas kaa vaada kahin gaayab ho gaya he or uski jagah ab hindu rashtrawaad ne le lee he
 There has been an atmosphere of excitement in the Congress in Bihar since the Bharatiya Janata Party took three Hindi-speaking states out of its hands in December
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''or ab to hamaare paas priyanka gandhi bhi hai
 His formal entry into politics will have a huge impact in Bihar
 vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet ke baad yah party ko takat degaa
 Suddenly, the inclination of the people towards Congress has increased
 jad (you) ke purv bahubali netaa anant singh samet kai netaa aagaamee loksabhaa ke liye congress se tikat paane kii ummid paale hai
 He says, "they (congress) may or may not give us tickets but i will support Congress
" or jitunga bhi
 "another Bahubali leader Rajesh Ranjan Yadav alias Pappu Yadav also wants the Congress to support his candidature from Madhepura
 unki patni ranjita ranjan supaul se congress saansad hai
 a senior Congress leader believes that the way people have got in the line of getting tickets from the party is evidence that the Congress is strengthening its position in Bihar
 mana ja rahaa he ki keval bahubali netaa hi nahin, shatrughna sinha jaise bhaajapa ke kai asantusht netaa bhi congress se tikat kii aas lagaae hai
 But the problem in Bihar is that the party is at the bottom of the political hierarchy
 yahaan bada asar daalane ke liye party ko lalu prasad yadav kii party rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 Just look at this: In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the bjp-led NDA won 31 out of 40 seats in the state, the RJD got around 18 percent votes
 congress or rajd ke voton ko mila den to unke paas 29 pratishat vot ho jate hai
 But this is also less than the votes of Nitish Kumar's JD (U), Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP and BJP in 2014
 baharhaal, congress netaaon kaa kahana he ki yah hisaab sahi nahin he
 "the Modi wave" is over in Bihar and other parts of the country, says a party leader in the state
 isliye bhaajapa ko dobaaraa utane vot nahin milane vaale
 "there is so much enthusiasm among the party leaders and workers that they are working day and night to make Rahul's rally a success and his talk is heard everywhere in the state
" log maanate hai ki agar raily safal rahi to congress agadi jatiyon ke vot bhaajapa se apni taraf khinch sakati he
 Till 1990, Congress had a large share of Dalit and Muslim votes
 haalanki rajd ke saath congress kaa maitreepurn gathbandhan he lekin ab vah apni khoi hui rajaitik jameen dobaaraa waapas paane kii koshish karegi
 Jha was appointed in September last year, the first time since Jagannath Mishra in 1991 to appoint a Brahmin as the head of the state unit
 ise congress kii sochi-samajhi chaal ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Although the number of forward castes in Bihar is only 11-12 percent, they change the outcome of elections due to the division of votes of other castes between RJD, JD (U), Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and other parties
 Has the ability to congress ke netaaon kaa aarope he ki bhaajapa ne isiilie aakhri kshanon main aarthik rup se kamjor savarnon ke liye naukariyon main 10 pratishat aarakshan dene kii chaal chali he
 The first signs of disillusionment of the upper castes with the BJP were seen in the 2015 assembly elections when the Congress won 27 seats
 party kii ore se maidan main utaare gaye agadi jati ke 16 ummidavaaron main se 12 chunaav jeet gaye the
 This time the Congress is looking to win big with old allies and new parties like RLSP, Jeetan Ram Majhi's Hindustan Awam Morcha and Mukesh Sahni's VIP

 There is a thinking in our society that physical, mental and emotional misconduct is only with the girls but it is not so
 kai maamalon main ladakon ko bhi shaareerik shoshan, maansik aghat or bhaavnaatmak thokar kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Exploitation can happen to children at any age
 beete kuch saalon main to kai aise maamle aae hai jinamein do saal yaa usase bhi choti umr ke bachche ke saath shoshan kii pushti hui he
 Many times this happens because the parents do not spend time with the child and the child is not able to share his problems with them
 kya hota he asar?shoshan chaahe jaisaa bhi ho bachche par uskaa nakaaratmak asar hi hota he
 This makes the child feel physically, mentally and emotionally broken
 par bhaavnaatmak pahalu se wo sabase adhik prabhavit hota he
 He not only loses faith in himself, but also he is not able to trust his elders
 shoshan kii samyavadhi bhi ise kaaphi prabhavit karti he
 There are more chances of such children being sabotaged and becoming a threat to themselves
 aise bachche nashe ke prati bhi zyada aakarshith hote hai
 Over time, when these children grow up, sometimes there is a sense of revenge in them and they also harass their children in the same way as they did themselves
 unke is vyavhaar kaa asar unke baaki sambandhon par bhi padataa he
 What is the solution? First of all, such situations should not be allowed in which the child is not the victim of any such unpleasant incident
 aap use zyada vakt ke liye akelaa na chhoden
 Talk to the child as much as possible so that you can get an idea of every activity
 saath hi agar aisa kuch ho jaataa he to counslar kii madad lenaa na bhoolen
 Also, try to convince the child that he can trust you
 american psychological association kii ek study ke anusaar, bachapan main hui aisi kisi bhcopriy ghatana kaa sabase zyada asaradimagi taur par hota he
 In such a situation, it should be tried that the child should be given maximum love and every little and big action should be kept hidden so that he does not go into depression

 Most of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's tenure was spent dealing with the flaws of his government and the ruthless antics of his own party

 But now this is enough

 Gehlot presented a populist budget and about Rs 5,000 crore

 When the screening committee chairman Ajay Maken and his team sat in the Haryana State Guest House in Delhi, it took only 50 hours to sort the potential candidates from a list of more than 4,000 names
 gahalot kaa daawa he ki kareeb 300 sambhavit ummidavaaron kii aakhri suchi rahul kii ankhon se hokar gujaregi
 The screening committee also included Congress general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Gurudas Kamat and state Congress president Chandrabhan Singh

 Names have already been shortlisted, having lost twice and by a huge margin in 2008

 "obviously, Rahul has scrutinized the names and faces of these elections
" unhone sitambar main do reliyon ko sambodhit kiya tha or abhi 23 aktubar ko ve do or reliyon ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 Congress president Sonia Gandhi will also hold a rally in Jaipur before the party begins its election campaign in mid-november

 rajasthan main 25 loksabhaa siten hai or yahaan ke matadaataaon ne aam chunaavon main akasar vidhansabha chunaav kii apni pasand ko hi doharaaya he
 The party organized a meeting of the All India Congress Committee in the state and started a rescue operation in January this year to focus on it
 ek maheene baad rahul ne rajasthan kii satta bachaane kii yojana kaa khaakaa bananaa shuru kiya
 At the meeting of the state Congress presidents in Delhi, he asked Chandrabhan to take advantage of the government's achievements in the social sector in Rajasthan
 chandrabhan kehete hai, ‘‘satta virdohi lahar kaa muqabla karne kaa yahi ek rasta he
 "this is the same Chandrabhan, who had earlier publicly stated that his party would have to be let down in the next elections
" gahalot ne bhi ishaara bhaanpakar vitt mantri kii dohari bhoomika nibhaate hue march main jabardast loklubhaavan bajet pesh kar daalaa

 may main pradesh ke daure par aae rahul ne varisht netaaon main josh kaa sanchaar karte hue kaha tha, ‘‘sthiti badal rahi he, log khush ho rahe hai
 Despite this, the Congress' hopes of winning 101 seats to get a simple majority in the Assembly still seem far-fetched as it had won only 96 seats in 2008 (which later increased to 102)
 isamen ve 15 siten bhi shaamil hai, jinhen usne maamuli antar se jeeta tha
 In view of the allegations of corruption against Gehlot and his family, his image of 2008 needs to be revived once again
 unhen kisi khaas buniyadi dhaanche kaa nirmaan na kar paane vaale ek kharaab prashaasak ke taur par dekha jaataa he yaa un par sarkari skulon kii shiksha ko nazarandaaj karne kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he jiske chalate bahut se sarkari skool band ho rahe hai
 This fact is also not going to go in his favor

 The government says that every year two and a half million patients get most of the medicines prescribed in prescriptions for free and so far about 13 from this scheme
 7 karod log labhanvit ho chuke hai jo pradesh kii aabaadi kaa doguna he
 That is, in principle every resident of the state has benefited from this scheme

 Most of the schemes have some flaws

 Gehlot's answer in this case is, "there will always be some shortfall if such a big welfare scheme is implemented
 lekin janata ke paisa janata ke paas ja rahaa he
 Concerned with populist promises, Gehlot also has the support of the almost complete first phase of the Jaipur Metro Rail to keep his flag high

 The refinery project is undergoing criticism
 isaki aadharshila sonia gandhi ne pichley maheene sitambar main rakhi
 The Gehlot government funded the project and spent around Rs 200 crore

 BJP makes fun of Gehlot's plans

 In March, Rahul asked Gehlot to start a journey to answer Raje's Suraj Sankalp Yatra

 But before the Congress, there are challenges to address different societies of the state
 vibhinn jaateey or dharmik samoohon ke bich vidwesh he jo or bhi bad saktaa he
 The arrest of Jat leader Mahipal Maderna and Bishnoi leader Malkhan Singh in the murder of Bhanwari Devi has angered these communities
 gurjar isliye naaraaz hai ki gahalot ne unhen 5 fisadi obisi kota nahin diya
 There is resentment among Muslims about the Gopalgarh case in September 2011
 jisaki jaanch sibiai kar rahi he
 Many Hindus are unhappy with the arrest of Asaram Bapu in the rape case while former minister Babulal Nagar, a favorite accused of rape, Gehlot, is roaming freely

 There is one more screw: Congress won in 1998 and 2008 when Gehlot was not projected as chief minister
 alabatta 2003 main jab unhen mukhyamantri ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha, lekin congress buree tarah se haar gai thi
 Gehlot now says that the ability to win will determine the selection of the chief ministerial candidate
 party ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, ‘‘gahalot chatur hai

 tippaniyan Aamir Khan started his career as a child artiste at the age of eight with the films 'yaadon Ki Baaraat' (1973) and 'madhosh' (1974) by Nasir Hussain

 But, around the same time, Aamir tasted success as an actor for the first time from the film 'qayamat Se Qayamat Tak'

 When i was new, i did not know where and how my career would progress
 mujhe kaha gaya tha ki ek abhinayta kaa jeevankaal paanch saal hota he, jabaki uske baad janata use dekhakar bor hone lagati he
 ' aamir khan ne ek bal kalakaar ke rup main aath saal kii umr main nasir hossain kii film ‘yaadon kii baraat’ (1973) or ‘madahosh’ (1974) se apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Nearly 11 years later, he started his acting career as a young artist with Ketan Mehta's film 'holi', which did not get much success
 lekin, lagbhag isi dauraan aamir ne abhinayta ke taur par film ‘qayaamat se qayaamat tak’ se pehali baar safalataa kaa swaad chakhaa
 Aamir Khan, who has completed 25 years in the film industry, said, 'I am very happy and surprised after completing 25 years in the film industry
 jab main nayaa tha tab main yah nahin jaanata tha ki kahaan or kaise meraa kariyar aage badhegaa
 i was told that the lifespan of an actor is five years, when the public starts getting bored after seeing it

 The number of people who attacked Kumar Vishwas from Kejriwal camp of Aam Aadmi Party is increasing continuously
 party ke media manager vikaas yogi ne ek khulaa khat likhakar vishwaas par bade aarope lagaae hai
 Vikas claims that Kumar is plotting to split the party
 chitthee ke jariye aarope lagaaya gaya he ki dilli emsidi chunaav or punjab vidhansabha chunaav main campagne ke liye kumaar vishwaas ne hi inkaar kiya tha
 Earlier on Monday, Youth Wing national in-charge Vandana Singh took to Twitter to call Kumar Vishwas a fraudster
 vandana ne apane twit main likhaa tha, "subah akhbaar padho, to ek adaniya bade bhai roj party ko bachaane ke naam par party ko hi gaaliyaan dete hai
 Stop cheating on yourself and the party
 bhaiya dow
 Kumar Vishwas, you ask questions in interviews and rhetoric, can't a volunteer like me ask you on Twitter too? When you have decided to fight, Dr
 kumaar vishwaas to saamne se ladiye aap jawaab dijie
 Your social media army speaks the language of the social media army of Modi ji
 "padhie AAP ke media manager kaa vishwaas ke naam khulaa patr"pranaam bhaiya, bahut din se kuch kehane kii soch rahaa tha lekin samaj nahin aa rahaa tha kaise! khud se puch rahaa tha ki aap sahi ho yaa main jo dekh paa rahaa hum or jitna choti si buddhi main jo samaj paaya wo sahi he
 From 2011 till today, you have helped me a lot, in every way, i have no problem in accepting
 lekin isamen ek sawaal man main tha, jab bhi aapane meri madad kii, uske kuch din se kai din tak kai log aakar bolte the ki kumaar bol rahe the tumhen madad di he unhone? bhaiya main aap jaison ke sahare se hi jinda hum
 Everyone who is able helps each other, in different ways but does not sing
 or hamaari party main mere jaise bahut saare log hai jo kisi na kisi ke sahare ji rahe hai
 i heard in your Rajasthan meeting that you were saying that a girl who has become an MLA came to you to ask for help to go to Farrukhabad, brother, i was also one of them
 aise kitne log the jinhone us samay madad di hogi, kuldeep bhaiya ko to aap jaanate hi honge, unhone mere jaise kai logon kaa kharchaa uthaaya, lekin ajtak kisi se kuch nahin bolaa
 There are other people who help but do not sing, the help given to them, there has been no investment to earn a name by referring to this 'help' in future
 par meri samaj main bilkul nahin aa paa rahaa he jisaki aapaki madad karte hai aap use gaate kyon hai? baharhaal, ho saktaa he ye aapkaa swabhaav ho, kya kar sakate hai
 In 2014, you were not the only loser, Arvind Kejriwal was also defeated, Ashutosh lost, Ashish Khaitan lost, Gul Panag lost, Meera Sanyal ji lost even more people, but everyone continued
 aap bhi apni ichha anusaar kaam karte rahe
 In the party where there was a ruckus to stand again, everything went on normally in your life, when all the volunteers were trying to save the movement by sweating blood after the 2014 Lok Sabha debacle, then you sat on TV The reason for the defeat was to impose on the party leaders and they were just angry
 aapkaa times nau ko diya gaya intervyuu ham sab ko yaad he
 i sometimes thought that you were right somewhere
 vidhaan sabha 2015 ke ghoshnaa hoti he
 Everyone abandons everything and starts to save the party
 kyunki ye party or aandolan ke astitv kii ladaai thi
 My forehead was determined that even then you were angry
 kya ye sach nahin he? jab ghar main ghar ko bachaane kii ladaai hoti he, to sab ek saath aa jate hai
 But here everyone used to work during the day and celebrate you in the evening
 baahar aapane ye messej failaa rakhaa tha ki aapako involve nahin kiya ja rahaa (aapane ye vaala card baar-baar khelaa he)
 i remember the days when everyone was celebrating you for publicity
 us din anjaane main main bhi vahiin tha
 There were less than 25 days left in the election
 kis baat kaa gussa tha ye? aapane pehali raily shaayad 19 janvari ko kii thi, tab jab saare channel ek taraf se kah rahe the ki 'aap' kii sarkaar banane vaali he
 Wow, did not even a volunteer get the news of what played the right game
 jo baat mujhe dukhi kar rahi thi wo yah thi ki amaanat kaa wo bayaan jisamen unhone aapako bijepi kaa agent bolaa
 i was also sad, i was also in favor of proceeding on them
 aapke aansu dekhakar dil meraa bhi tutaa
 But i am thinking that till now our biggest leader Arvind Kejriwal whom you also consider a leader, a rogue is accused of taking a bribe of 2 crores cash, then you do not feel sad, your tears do not come
 aapse sawaal kiya gaya to aapane kaha mujhe ye gandagi main nahin janaa
 Which shit? You had to say your point in the media but above Kapil, you had to speak in the PAC
 ye kyon bhaiya?ek saptaah main hamaare domantri par sibiai kii redhui jinamein se ek aapke bachapan ke dost manish sisodiya ji bhi hai
 What a friendship it is, even if you leave politics aside, when the whole party is walking shoulder to shoulder with them, the whole world is appreciating them for their work
 lekin aapako un par bhi shaq ho gaya
 You could not make a tweet in their favor? You are sometimes calling someone as khar, corruption, someone tadka, someone traitor
 kya isse party ko nuksaan nahin hota? bahut saare niyaswaarth kaaryakarta jo aapaki sachai nahin jaanate (ki 2015 kii tarah hi aapane jaan boojhkar MCD main bhi tikat bantwane ke baad prachaar ke time par gaayab ho gaye, date hi nahin di, jabaki aapane failaayaa ye kii aapako kisi ne poocha hi nahin), wo abhi bhi izzat dete hai aapako, unki ummiido kaa kya hoga jab ve aapaki hakeekat janenge? bhaiya, unamem se kai aapako sirf isliye bhi pyaar karte hai kyonki unhen lagata he kii aravind ji kii tarah aap bhi party ke hit main hi sochate rahete hai
 It is not that i do not have any problem with the party, but i used to tell everyone inside, of which you were also one and perhaps even the chief
 iske baad mere screenshot viral kiye jaayenge, jo maine aapako kabhi pehle kisi ke bare main likhe honge, ped kaaryakarta bolaa jaayegaa lekin koi baat nahin, main bhi purana kaaryakarta hi hum shaayad jinaki aap baat karte ho to ye bhi sahi
 You say that this party was made by 3 people sitting at your house, but according to me, the party is made by the hard work of those volunteers in whose name you are driving a gun
 bhaiya aap bade kavi ho, aap apni jindagi chalaa loge, lekin is andolan main bahut saare log sabakuch chhodkar sadak par aa gaye hai, unke sapane nijee swaarth ke liye mat todiye
 i myself have spent my month's expenses very hard
 mere jaise bahut log hai
 You are adept at speaking, but one question comes to mind, why did you not appear in the TV debates after 2014 while fighting for the party? Whenever i call you, you refuse
 lekin apane man se kabhi kuch bolnaa hota media main to bol dete the
 Isn't it true that you told me to fix an interview with my big anchor on March 11, that is, on the day of Punjab results, but we lost Punjab and you changed the plan, i did not know what that plan was
 main aapke ghar aayaa ek din, mujhe yaad he aapane mujhase kaha thainchh chunaav main prachaaranhi karuunga, jab jansabhaayen lagaayi ja rahi thim tab maine aapako kol bhi kiya tha lekin jaise aapane kaha tha pehle hi, aapane bilkul bhi prachaar nahin kiya
 And you kept saying that the party did not use me
