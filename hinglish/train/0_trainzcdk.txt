 modi ne gujarat ke surendranagar main raily main yah baat kahi
 Prime Minister Modi's reference was to surgical strikes and airstrikes in Pakistan in response to the Uri and Pulwama terror attacks
 modi ne kaha, 'ab se pehle pakistan se aatankwaadi yahaan aate the or hamalaa karke chale jate the
 Pakistan used to threaten us that it had a nuclear bomb and if India retaliated we would press the button
 'pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'hamaare paas bamon kaa bam he
 i told them to do whatever you want to do, but we will backfire
 modi ne kaha, 'ateet main hamaare log rote the, duniya ko jaakar bataate the ki pakistan ne ye kar diya, wo kar diya, lekin ab pakistan ke rone kii baari he
 Modi said, 'did not our soldiers enter and kill them in their homes? Shall we not enter them and kill them? Shall we not avenge our martyred soldiers? ”speaking on Mahavir Jayanti, Modi said,“ Today is Mahavir Jayanti, the day to observe peace
 lekin hamen shanti kab milegi? kya koi shanti kii apil karne vaale kii sunata he yaa kisi majboot aadmi kii chetavanee sunata he, jo apane baaju rakhata he? keval ek majboot vyakti kii shanti kii apil suni jaaegi, kamjor vyakti kii nahin
 He also targeted the Congress over the armed forces
 modi ne kaha, 'aapane dekha hoga ki is chunaav main congress party kaa charitra kaise badal gaya he
 The way the Congress spreads lies, and questions the country's army, saying that its chiefs are roadblocks goons, the Air Force chiefs are liars, if you say something like that, wouldn't it please Pakistan?

 navadurga ke duusare swaroop maa brahmacharini kii puja karne se gyaan or vairaygy kii prapti hoti he
 In scriptures, the importance of the worship method and the story of the mother form
 maa brahmacharini kii katha jivan ke kathin kshanon main bhakton ko sambal detii he
 Karpadamabhyamakshmalkamandalu to worship the mother

 This form of Goddess is completely lit and extremely gorgeous
 maa ke daaen haath main jap kii maala he or baayen haath main yah kamandal dhaaran kiye hai
 In the Kathapuram birth of Mother Brahmacharini, this goddess was born as a daughter of the Himalayas and underwent severe penance to receive Lord Shankar as a husband through Narada's teachings
 is kathin tapasya ke kaaran inhentapashchaarini arthath brahmacharininam se janaa gaya
 For a thousand years, he spent only eating fruits and flowers, and for a hundred years, living only on the land, he lived on the herb
 kuch dinon tak kathin upwas rakhe or khule akaash ke neeche varsha or dhoop ke ghor ksht sahe
 For three thousand years, the broken leaves were eaten and worshiped Lord Shankar
 iske baad to unhone sookhe bilva patr khaanaa bhi chhod die
 For several thousand years, she continued to perform penance by remaining waterless and unharmed
 patton ko khaanaa chhod dene ke kaaran hi inkaa naam aparnaa naam pad gaya
 Due to hard penance, the body of the goddess was completely eroded
 devtaa, rishi, siddhgan, muni sabhi ne brahmacharini kii tapasya ko abhootpurv punya krity bataaya, saraahna kii or kaha- he devi aaj tak kisi ne is tarah kii kathor tapasya nahin kii
 It was possible only by you
 aapaki manokamana paripurna hogi or bhagwaan chandramauli shivaji tumhen pati rup main praapt honge
 Now leave penance and return home
 jald hi aapke pita aapako lene aa rahe hai
 The essence of the mother's story is that even in the difficult struggles of life, the mind should not be distracted
 maa brahmacharini devi kii krupa se sarv siddhi praapt hoti he
 Petrol and diesel will now be available every day at different petrol pumps across the country

 It can be announced in a day or two
 gauratlab he ki paanch shaharon par pehle se hi ye payalat project chal rahaa he
 From May 1, the government introduced a system of dynamic prices on petrol and diesel in five cities of the country
 iske tahat puducheri, vijag, udaipur, jamshedpur or chandigarh main petrol or dijal ke daam main har din ke hisaab se badlaav ho rahaa tha
 Sources in the government say that this project has been very successful and hence it is now ready to implement it across the country

 North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is once again in a mood for war
 america dwaara gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se koyale kii khep le ja rahe malwahak jahaaj ko sij karne kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad kim jong un ne sakht tevar akhriyaar kiya he
 The tension has been growing ever since the second talks between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un were canceled
 donon ke bich farvari main vietnam kii rajdhani hanoi main duusari baar mulaakaat or vaarta honi thi, lekin matbhedon ke chalate nahin ho pai
 The US demanded North Korea to destroy nuclear weapons and North Korea demanded the lifting of the ban
 isko lekar donon ke bich baat nahin bani or uttar korea phir se apane puraane rukh par laut aayaa he
 Now North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un has once again instructed his army to increase its ability to attack
 uttar korea kii korean central news agency (KCNA) ne sena se seemaa par yuddh or kisi bhi apatkaal paristhiti se nipatane ke liye puri tarah taiyaar rahane ko kaha he
 The Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim Jong Un as saying that the guarantee of peace and security of the country is possible only with strong military power
 sainya shakti ke jariye hi desh kii samprabhutaa kii suraksha kii jaati he
 Therefore, North Korea has set important tasks to increase its attacking capability
 guuruuvaar ko uttar korea ne kam duuri tak maar karne vaali do mixilon kaa pareekshan karke america or dakshin korea ko saaf sanket de diya tha ki wo phir se apni parmaanu kshamta badhayega
 Earlier in November 2017, North Korea tested a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile

 He will use these new weapons in the war against South Korea and America
 ghatate pravaah or lagaataar badhate pradooshan se bejaar patit paavani ganga ke liye alag mantralay ban saktaa he
 Homework has begun for the formation of a new Ganga ministry in the soon to be ruling Narendra Modi government at the Center
 rashtriya ganga nadi basin praadhikaran ne ganga mantralay kii ruparekha banani shuru kar di he taaki ganga kii aviralata-nirmalata se jude masalon par teji se kaam ho sake
 In the matter, a separate Ministry for Ganga will be proposed in the Mission Clean Ganga meeting to be held in Delhi on Friday
 ganga kii raksha ke liye bade kadam uthaae jane ke bhi sanket mili hai
 Before leaving for the important meeting of Mission Clean Ganga to be held in Delhi on Friday, National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) member Prof
 bidi treepathi ne iskaa khulaasa kiya
 He said that before the swearing in of the new government, a lot of homework on the Ganga has started
 isamen ganga kii samasyaon or lakshya tak pahunchane ke liye kis disha main kadam badhaane honge, aise gambhir masalon par charchaa hone ke asaar hai
 Pro
 treepathi ne bataaya ki ganga ke liye alag mantralay banaae jane kaa prastaav vah mishan clin ganga kii baithak main rakhenge
 Emphasis will be given to open the office of this ministry in Kashi itself so that unnecessary run-off can be avoided
 ab tak enziarbie paryaavaran mantralay ke adheen kaam karata rahaa he, lekin is mantralay ke paas khud ke itane kaam hai ki ganga ke liye sambandhit mantri or adhikari samay hi nahin nikaal pate
 This can also be considered as an important reason for the NGRBA remaining indifferent to the previous government
 sarkari amale kii kathith laaparvaahee or pareshaaniyon kii sunwaayee na hone ke virodh main seesamau ilaake ke ek vyakti ne apane ghar par pakistan kaa jhanda laga liya
 On receiving the complaint, the police are questioning him by taking him into custody

 haryana vidhansabha membijepico bina shart samarthan dene kaa vaada karne vaale kanda ko 27 or 28 november ko vishesh jaj ajay kumaar kuhad ke saamne pesh hone ke liye kaha gaya he
 On October 4 and 11, the court granted him exemption from personal appearance
 kanda ne suchit kiya tha ki wasirsavidhansabha kshetra ke chunaav abhiyaan main vyast hai
 Kanda contested as the candidate of Haryana Lokhit Party in which he was victorious

 Geetika Sharma, an air hostess who works with Kanda's MLDR Airlines, was found dead on 5 August 2012 at her Ashok Vihar residence in northwest Delhi
 kanda is cese main abhiyukt hai
 In her suicide note, Geetika Sharma said that she was ending her life due to alleged "harassment" of Kakanda and her employee Aruna Chadha

 jammu-kashmir main sarkaar gathan ke liepidipi ne vichaar-vimarshaki prakriya kar di he
 Thoughts are forming inside the party about the alliance before the possible discussion with Governor NN Vohra this week
 pidipi ke mukhya pravaktaa naeem akhtar kaa kahana he ki sarkaar gathan ke liye gathjod kii vibhinn sambhaavnaaon par nav nirvaachit vidhayakon ke saath anaupchaarik baatcheet hui he
 Akhtar also mentioned that all options are open for PDP, including alliances with BJP
 akhtar ne kaha, 'rajyapal ke saath party netritv kii baithak se pehle ham party ke andar ek aam raay banane kii prakriya main hai
 Vohra sent separate letters to the PDP and BJP on Friday, inviting their leaders to come before January 1 to discuss government formation

 PDP founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed walked out of his Gupakar Road residence on Sunday for the first time this week for medical examination
 akhtar ne bataaya, 'unhone (said ne) kuch samay pehle aankh kii surgery karai thi or vah iske baad hone vaali jaanch ke liye gaye
 'significantly, the PDP on Saturday laid strict conditions for the BJP
 darasal, bijepi rajya main nai sarkaar ke gathan ke liye use rijhaa rahi he
 The PDP declared that there could be no discussion on the party's stand against the abolition of Article 370 of the Constitution (special status to Jammu and Kashmir)
 bijepi se gathjod par kashmakashpidipi ne sanket diya ki party ko bijepi ke saath gathjod karne main kaaphi mushkilen pesh aa rahi hai, jiske 25 vidhayak hai
 The PDP also said that it is committed to abolishing the controversial Armed Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA), which is unlikely to be acceptable to the BJP
 party ne kaha ki sabhi vikalp khule hue hai or philhal koi faisla nahin kiya gaya he, lekin khabar he ki bijepi ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke gathjod par vah apane vidhayakon ke ek bade dhade se sakht virodh kaa saamana kar rahi he
 Another option PDP has is to seek the support of Congress, which has 12 mlas
 saath hi neshnal conference kaa samarthan le jiske 15 vidhayak hai
 He is in contact with both parties
 baharhaal, raajnneetik galiyaaron main ye atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki yadi pidipi ke saath bijepi kisi samjhaute tak nahin pahunchati he to bijepi ek janvari tak rajyapal ko 30 vidhayakon kii ek suchi pesh kar yah dikhaaegi ki uske paas pidipi se do vidhayak adhik hai
 This would create the possibility that he be invited first to form the government
 -input bhashaa se India lags behind its equal countries in terms of both quality and quantity of education
 18 se 23 varsh ke bich kii kul aabaadi main ucch shiksha ke liye panjikrut logon kaa anupaat bharat main kareeb 20 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 This can be called gross registration ratio
 duusari ore kai desh is maamle main hamase bahut aage hai
 The ratio is 28 percent in China, 36 percent in Brazil and 55 percent in Japan
 ucch shiksha dene vaale vaishvik sansthaanon kii times kii ore se jari variyata suchi main sheersh 200 sansthaanon main bharat kaa ek bhi santhaan shaamil nahin he
 Two or more institutions from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, South Korea and Japan have found place in this list
 asal main 1991 ke baad bharat main lagu hue aarthik sudhaaron main ucch shiksha ko puri tarah se nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 The HR Ministers either completely ignored the reforms or failed in trying to implement them
 paanch dashak se zyada kaa samay guzar chukaa he, lekin is kshetra main rajkaaj ke buniyadi dhaanche main abhi tak koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 At the helm of this mechanism is an institution called the University Grants Commission (UGC), which was established in 1952 and was given statutory status through the UGC Act of 1956
 yah sanstha medical council of india, baar council of india, ol india council for technical ajukeshan sareekhee uski parishadon or centre tathaa rajya sarkaron ke saath milakar ucch shiksha ke vibhinn pahaluon par puraa niyantran rakhti he
 For example, the establishment of universities, the functioning and regulation within them, etc
 bharat main vishvavidhyalayon kii sthapana karne ke sirf do raste hai
 They are either in the government sector or private
 pehla rasta yah he ki iske liye centre yaa rajya sarkaar ek kanoon banaae
 The second way is to grant UGC an honorary university status to an existing institution
 bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (iity) or akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) jaise degree dene vaale rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan kendriya kanoon ke jariye sthapit hai or ye ujisi ke daayre se baahar hai
 Apart from these, the Indian Institutes of Management (iims) in the public sector and the Indian School of Business in the private sector are also outside the purview of UGC as they offer diplomas, not degrees
 degree dene vaale sabhi collejon ko kisi-na-kisi kendriya yaa rajyastareey vishvavidhyalay se sambhddha hona chahie
 Whether those universities are central government, state government or private sector
 nijee yaa maanad vishvavidhyalay ekal santhaan hote hai, jinke paas duusare collejon ko manyata dene kaa adhikaar nahin hota
 Universities and colleges have almost complete control of the UGC, its councils and the central and state governments
 centre or rajya sarkarein apane daayre main aane vaale vishvavidhyalayon ke anudaan ko puri tarah niyantrit karti hai
 They regularly interfere in the decision making process of these institutions
 in vishvavidhyalayon kii gavarning body main sarkari pratinidhi hote hai
 These universities need government or UGC approval to start new academic programs or subjects
 inamen faikalti kii niyukti main sarkaar or nyaaypalika, donon kaa dakhal rahata he
 As is often seen, the university's decision to appoint someone prohibits the court in a jolt
 iske alaava sarkarein or ujisi hi shikshan shulk or faikalti kii tankhwaah bhi tay karte hai
 Colleges have to seek approval from the accrediting university to introduce new courses or to alter the content of existing courses
 maujuuda vyavastha ke mutabik, ujisi kii manjuuri ke bagaiyr koi bhi nai degree lagu nahin kii ja sakati
 At the time when this system was created, at that time there were arguments in its favor
 tab arthvyavastha sankuchit thi or prashasnic sansaadhan bhi bahut kam the
 The UGC could then prepare the syllabus at the central level and apply it uniformly across universities, set standards of faculty qualifications and ensure quality
 aazaadee ke baad jaisi paristhitiyaan thim, unamem yah vyavastha prachhann hiton or bhrashtachar se apekshaakrit mukt thi
 Perhaps this was the reason why the University Grants Commission could function better in the national interest at that time
 aaj duniya badal chuki he
 The economy, population and higher education needs have also expanded accordingly in the fifties
 yah kshetra jitani teji se fail rahaa he, vah ab ujisi or sarkaron ke niyantran se baahar jaataa dikh rahaa he
 Today we have 574 universities, 35,539 colleges and 2
 03 karod chaatr-chatraayen hai (2011-12)
 It is not a matter of a single institution to control such a large education system at the central level
 technology ke kshetra main teji se ho rahaa badlaav or bhumandalikaran aae din adhyayan ke nae kshetron ko saamne laa rahe hai
 In countries like America, universities providing modern education are constantly changing themselves
 duusari ore hamaare yahaan iske thik ulat ujisi or uski parishaden srijan kii raah main baadha ban rahi hai or faikalti ko is tantra main koi hissedari nahin dena chaahatin
 These institutions are also facing allegations of heavy corruption
 vishvavidhyalayon ke bheetar protsaahan or puraskaar kaa chalan naukarshahi vaale padon se zyada judaa hua he, jiskaa academik uplabdhiyon se kuch khaas lenaa-dena nahin he
 The result is that teachers are missing from classrooms and nothing new is happening in the field of research
 is tantra kii khaamiyon ko durust karne ke liye koi jaadu kii chadi hamaare paas nahin he
 If we understand the demand of time, then there is one thing that has to be implemented immediately - decentralization and autonomy at all levels
 hamen apane shikshakon main zyada bharosa jataana hoga tathaa siyaasi, naukarshahi or nyaayik dakhal ko kam-se-kam karnaa hoga
 We developed our teaching system on the lines of Britain
 vahaan ujisi ko khatm kiye hue do dashak se zyada kaa vakt biit chukaa he or aaj vahaan kii puri shikshan pranali zyada vikendrikrut he
 Beginning with the opening of new universities
 iske liye vishvavidhyalayon kii sthapana ke vaaste kanoon banane kii shart ko khatm karnaa hoga
 Some scale related to infrastructure, faculty, curriculum and sponsorship will have to be decided
 aisa koi bhi santhaan, chaahe vah nijee ho yaa sarkari, munafa kamaane vaala ho yaa dharmarth kaary karne vaala, yadi vah in maanakon ko puraa karata he to use manjuuri di jaani hogi
 States should have the full authority to grant such approval at their own and at the national level this right should be with the Center
 kuch chuninda sansthaanon ko ujisi se maanad darja dene kaa praavdhaan khatm kiya janaa hoga
 If universities want government grants, they will have to fulfill the condition of going through the process of getting government recognition for this
 iske alaava munafa kamaane vaale or dharmarth sansthaanon ke liye kar pranali bhi alag-alag honi chahie
 Colleges have complete freedom to choose the university from which they wish to seek accreditation
 chaahe vah sarkari ho yaa nijee, munafa kamaane vaala ho yaa dharmarth
 Also if they meet the standards then they should have an option to convert themselves into universities
 rajyon ke paas adhikaar hone chahie ki ve khud apane medical college sthapit kar saken
 There should be a provision for a qualifying examination in every state for doctors wishing to work with a doctoral degree from another state
 collejon or vishvavidhyalayon main kaamkaaj kii swaittata honi chahie, jisamen rajya, centre sarkaar yaa ujisi kii dakhsandaji kam-se-kam ho
 If we have faith in our teachers in the matter of teaching, then we have to show our confidence in their ability to prepare the syllabus
 das saal pehle jab main colombia uniwarsity main aayaa tha to yahaan main bhartiya arthvyavastha par ek paathyakram shuru karnaa chahta tha
 To do this i just had to submit a brief description of it to the university
 iske baad paathyakram ko uniwarsity ke catalog main shaamil kar liya gaya or icchhuk chaatro ne isamen panjikaran bhi karvaa liya
 If we do not personally trust a member of the faculty, then the entire faculty can be empowered to collectively accept or reject a course
 aaj kii tej raftaar or apane tarah kii vishistataaen lee hui duniya main ise vidambnaa hi kaha jayega ki buniyadi sudhaaron ko lagu karne kii bajaae ham ucch shiksha ke paathyakram main sanshodhan ke liye ek “rashtriya shiksha ayog” gathit karne ke bare main soch rahe hai
 Universities should also be given more leeway in terms of fixing tuition fees and salary of teachers and raising their resources
 ucch shiksha chunki bhavishya main ucch aay kaa strot he, isliye isaki keemat karadaata kii jeb se lene kii bajaae shiksha praapt karne vaale se lee jaani chahie
 It would be appropriate to do the same
 sarkaar iske liye karj de sakati he, lekin ek baar jab labhaarthi aay ke paryaapt str par pahunch jaae to us par karj lautaane kii baadhyataa honi chahie
 Allowing universities to fix salaries will also allow them to bring high quality faculty
 aaj sarvshereshth medhaaen vishvavidhyalayon kii bajaae nijee kshetra main ja rahi hai
 Many talented students, who want to remain in the academic world, are migrating abroad in search of good salaries
 videsh gaye aise pratibhashali bharatiyon ko waapas bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main bulaayaa ja saktaa he, basharte yahaan unhen acha vetan or swasth academik maahaul mili
 Universities should also be allowed to raise their own resources to initiate various schemes for the development of students in their own way
 kai kaamyaab bhartiya chunki shaikshanik sansthaanon kii madad karne ko icchhuk hai to aise main isse jude kanoonon ko kuch lacheela banaakar bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon kii mali haalat durust karne kii disha main prayaas kiya ja saktaa he
 As seen in the rest of the world, allowing rooms, halls, buildings, centers and professorships to be named after donors can make it easier to raise resources
 isse buniyadi dhaanche ke nirmaan main or shodh anudaan dene main madad mil sakati he
 An important drawback here is the distance between teaching and research, where the research work is assumed by the research councils
 ise tatkaal durust kiye jane kii jarurat he
 The thesis demands continuous interaction between students and faculty and within the faculty itself
 shodhakarya se adhyaapan ko laabh pahunchataa he
 Unless the students themselves have experience of research, they will not be able to do serious research
 isiilie shodhakarya ko vishvavidhyalayon ke daayre main laae jane kii bahut jarurat he
 Once this happens, the scope of dialogue between the university and industry will also be wide
 philhal sthiti yah he ki vishvavidhyalay, shodh parishaden or udyog teen alag-alag dwipon kii tarah kaam karte hai
 The barriers in the way of alliances between foreign universities, scholars and Indian and foreign universities also need to be removed
 america or britain main bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon ke saath bhagidaari ko lekar bahut utsaah he
 There are some internal problems in India not only with the entry of foreign universities, but also foreign scholars
 jaahir he, in sudhaaron ke liye ucch shiksha tantra kaa kayakalp karnaa padegaa
 The UGC and its various councils will have to be replaced and replaced by a regulatory entity with less authority
 centre or rajya sarkaron ko vishvavidhyalayon ke kaamkaaj main rojaanaa ke hasthnep se apane pair peeche khinchne honge
 Both the regulator and the government will have to transform themselves into an arbitrator instead of becoming the controllers of colleges and universities
 collejon or vishvavidhyalayon ke kaamkaaj main jab tak sarkari dakhal bana rahegaa, inke bich asal pratispardhaa kaa ubharna sambhav nahin hoga
 These institutions can be made competitive in the case of best teachers and best students only by providing autonomy and freedom to decide the teachers and their salary
 america ke nijee or sarkari vishvavidhyalayon kii kamyaabi kaa raaj yahi he ki unke paas vetan tay karne kii puri aazaadee hoti he, jiske chalate ve khule taur par sarvshereshth faikalti ke liye pratispardhaa karte hai
 In contrast, India's system is such that salaries are fixed by the government here
 iskaa shikshak ke pradarshan se koi lenaa-dena nahin hota
 On the one hand, there is no incentive for good teachers to improve themselves, on the other hand no punishment is given to bad teachers
 nateezaah kabhi-kabhaar hi koi shikshak apni prerana se apana kaam puri gambhirtha se kar paata he
 Some critics are apprehensive about the central role of the private sector in the educational system and point out the poor quality of teaching in private institutions in favor of their argument
 is aalochana ke saath teen dikkatein hai
 First of all, against every evil of higher education in the private sector, one evil of the higher education institution of the government sector can be counted
 masalan, sarkari vishvavidhyalayon main shikshakon kii kami ek badi samasya he
 In the Rajasthan University from which i have studied, till just a year ago, the fact of recruitment in the faculty was that the youngest face in the regular faculty was also 40 years old
 iske alaava shikshakon kaa gaiyrhaazir rahanaa sarkari collejon or vishvavidhyalayon kii ek duusari badi samasya he
 Secondly, if we want rapid expansion of education, then we will have to allow both government and private sectors to expand at their pace
 aankade bataate hai ki beete saalon main ucch shiksha kaa sarvaadhik vistaar nijee kshetra ke kaaran hi hua he or agar aisa na hota to panjikaran kaa anupaat kaaphi neeche hota
 In other words, if the private institutions had not supported the higher education of this country, many youth would have been deprived of college and university education
 schuli str par or management tathaa ejineering ke kshetra main to nijee sansthaanon ne gunvattta ke maamle main bhi acha yogadan diya he
 Today, many private schools, management institutes and private engineering institutes figure among the top
 sarkari kshetra ko uski umdaa misaalon se or nijee kshetra ko uski sabase kharaab misaalon se aankane kaa jo kaam aalochak akasar karte hai, vah ek chal he
 Today the issue of reforms in higher education stands before us
 asal sawaal yah he ki kya nai sarkaar is chunauti ko sweekaar karegi or yathasambhav vah sab kuch karegi, jisase bharat kii yuva aabaadi iskaa laabh uthaa sake yaa phir usee jaal main ja fansegi, jisamen fansi rahakar usase pehle kii sarkarein is desh kii aabaadi ko vinaash kii taraf le ja chuki hai

 If you look at the results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 in terms of assembly seat, BJP had won more votes than the opposition parties in 78 out of 90 seats

 tab america, france or britain ne hi UNSC main masood ajahar ke khilaaf prastaav laane kii pahal kii thi

 The newly elected President Ramnath was watching the oath-taking ceremony of Kovind, when Bangaru Laxman, the Dalit face of the BJP, remembered
 ek media house ke sting oparation main funsane ke baad lakshmana ko party adhyaksh pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 With this, his political career came to an end
 lakshmana par party ne kisi bhi tarah kii sahanubhuti dikhaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 He was the first Dalit leader to become BJP President
 vah aise samudaay se aate the, jo hameshaa se hi haashie par rahaa or utpeedan kaa shikaar rahaa
 His becoming BJP president was also unexpected
 hakeekat yah he ki unki bijepi adhyaksh pad par niyukti raajnneetik phaayde ke liye kii gai thi
 Though the reason behind the removal of Laxman from the post, the caste factor could not be ignored during the action against him
 ab yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki bijepi ke liye kovind ko raashtrapati banaaya janaa kya myne rakhata he?bangaroo lakshmana ke maamle main ek baar bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha tha ki unako apane kadachaar kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa he, lekin yah karrwai sirf ek hi vajah se nahin kii gai
 His being a Dalit was also a factor
 agar vah brahman yaa anya ucch jati ke hote, to unako itani zyada upeksha kaa shikaar nahin hona padataa
 It is a matter of how much she cares about the Dalits to open the BJP
 agar bijepi apane votbank yaa saamaajik agenda ke liye dalit chehre kaa istemaal karti he, to use dalit premi ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahie
 It should be worrying for the community that its thinkers and political activists are using their face and identity for political and electoral gains
 bangaroo lakshmana akele aise netaa nahin the, jinako kadachaar kaa doshi paaya gaya
 There are many cases including malpractices against several current BJP chief ministers, Union government ministers and senior leaders of the party, but they were not punished like Bangaru Laxman for various reasons including caste
 kya yah bijepi ke dalit prem kii hakeekat ko ujagar nahin karata he? bijepi ne raajnneetik majaburi ke chalate ek baar phir se dalit chehre kaa istemaal kiya he
 This time the BJP made Ramnath Kovind the presidential candidate to appease the Dalits
 ab vah desh ke raashtrapati hai
 Through this, the party has tried to give a strong message to the Dalits that it is their best
 bijepi ne ramnath kovind ko us samay raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya, jab dalit votbank par nirbhar rahane vaali kshetreey partiyaan kamjor ho rahi hai
 It is clear that the BJP wants to bring the Dalit votes in its favor
 bijepi ne raashtrapati chunaav main uttar bhartiya dalit ke rup main kovind card pehali baar khelaa he
 Now Kovind has become President by winning the election and he was also sworn in on Tuesday
 unke shapath samaaroh ke dauraan sansad ke central haal main 'jai shriram' or 'bharat mata kii jai' ke naare guunje, jo bijepi ke asli chehre ko phir se benakaab kar diya
 This made it clear what is in the heart of the BJP and what is its mask? However, the BJP is defending that what is wrong in raising such slogans? But the BJP has no answer to the question, why did she forget to raise the slogan 'jai Bhim' during this time? Does not raising the slogan of Jai Bhima with Jai Shriram indicate a clear distance between the party's Dalit face and reality? In recent times, BJP has tried to give Ambedkar a proper place, but on the day of Ramnath Kovind's oath People who believe in Ambedkar and really stand with the Dalits are shocked by the slogans of Jai Shri Ram and not the slogan of Jai Bhima
 isse yah to saaf ho gaya ki bijepi dalit chehre kaa istemaal raajnneetik hit ke liye kar rahi he or yahi uski hakeekat he
 No matter how hard BJP tries to hide the truth, the reality becomes self-evident
 central haal main jai shriram ke naare bijepi kii vichaardhaara or vishwaas ko darshata he, lekin kya ek dalit kaa raashtrapati chunaa utsav manaane kaa vakt nahin tha? agar haa, to jai bhim ke naare ko pehle kyon nahin lagaaya gaya
 The examination of shouting slogans of Jai Shriram in the Central Hall will be done only when slogans associated with other religions other than Hinduism will be raised
 yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya tab bijepi aise naaron kaa swaagat karegi? yah bijepi ke liye khushi kaa din he or usne apni khushi ko vyakt kiya he
 From Bangaru Laxman to Kovind becoming the President, the BJP tried its best to please the Dalits
 haalanki rohit vemula, oona ghatana or faridabad ghatana ke baad general wike singh kaa bayaan bijepi ke dohare chehre ko ujagar karte hai
 Several incidents, including the killing of Dalits on behalf of the mob, open the truss of bjp's votebank politics

" bijepi kaa ek special cell he jo sirf photoshop karke logon ko bahakaane kaa kaam karata he
 While replying to the allegations of the Congress, the State BJP spokesperson admitted to the mistake but also said that "we are asking the Siddaramaiah government of the state not on the photo but on the allegations which have been made in this charge sheet like corruption deteriorating law
" Arrangement etc
 lekin iske saath saath bijepi ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri siddaramaiya ne tumkar main solar power ke project ke liye "sarkari vigyaapan main tasviir turki kii lagaai he", par congress kaa kya kahana he
 Rizwan Arshad clarified that the solar power project in Tamkur is bigger than Turkey, so why should we put a picture of the Choye project
 jaise jaise chunaav najadik aa rahe hai vaise- vaise donon partiyon ke bich nok- jhonk badhati ja rahi he
 In the midst of all this, the BJP has launched the Bengaluru Bachao Abhiyan campaign in Bengaluru following these allegations and intends to complete the campaign in 14 days according to 2 assembly segments in all 28 assembly segments of the city

 But at the same time, BJP also alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has "put a picture of Turkey in government advertisement" for solar power project in Tumkur, but what Congress has to say
 rigwaan arshad kii safai thi ki tamkur main laga solar power project turki se bada he aise main ham choye project kii tasviir kyon lagaayenge
 As the elections are coming closer, the tip-off between the two parties is increasing

 Shocked, i said- "you are not watering no place
 i am right that there is no place for you
 It is the command of my head, my boss" and then as the whole darkness shivered she came near before returning to the back and my existence Once it touches, like someone touches the soil of the country

 Kedarnath in the lap of icebergs, a book that gives the pleasure of traveling to a picturesque, quiet corner of the earth with thoughts, philosophy and literature, which you can sit in the sweetest, most comfortable corner of the house held in your hands, even in the inaccessible mountains, gorges, valleys
 And on a journey to the jungles, what would it be like to feel the passing, it is felt reading Hema Uniyal's book of about 550 pages
 himalay ke paanch khandon main se ek kedarkhand vartmaan gadhwal he
 This book covers the entire region of the Himalayan peaks, snow-capped peaks, inaccessible mountains, the rivers passing through them, the cave-shrines of sages-sages and seekers, inscriptions of religion, bells echoing in the temple and all these along with the enthralling human life, There is a saga of people living in the lap of mountains
 jo kitaab hamen safar par le jaati he, use likhte hue khud lekhika ne kam safar nahin kiya he
 She went to almost every part of Uttarakhand where it was possible to reach
 lekhika kahati hai, ''prakruti ke sanidhya main yah yatraaen aanandadaayak raheen
 Alaknanda, Mandakini, Bhagirathi and Tons met throughout their youth

 "but still this is not a pure travelogue
 kitaab kii shuruyaat hi kedarkhand kii saanskrithik or aitihaasik prishthbhumi se hoti he
 She goes into the era of Vedas while going through the history, because from there, the famous Bhagirathi is also mentioned in the Vedas
 kedarnath or badrinath bhartiya sanathan samskruti ke pramukh centre hai
 After history, she writes in detail about all the scenic spots, temples, ghats, ashrams and serene natural places from Haridwar to Pauri Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli, Uttarkashi and Rudraprayag
 himalay se prem karne vaale or prakruti ke sanidhya main jeene vaale logon ke liye yah kitaab guide kaa kaam bhi kar sakati he, kyonki isamen kisi sthaan vishesh ke aitihaasik mahatv or prishthbhumi ke saath-saath vahaan jane ke sansadhano, rukne kii vyavastha aadi ke bare main bhi jaankaree di gai he
 But this is not just a travel guide because it has a deep emotional affection, which is experienced even while reading

 kedarkhand kaa zikr karte hue yah baaten isliye jaruri ho jaati hai ki prakruti ke antarang konon ko tathakthith dharm or aadhyatmikta ke jaal se mukt karke uske aadi rup main dekhne or mahasoos karne kii jarurat he
 Not in the way that the middle class of Hindustan sees the mountains during the summer holidays
 mal road main shopping karke, banaavati parkon main jhula jhulakar or coca cola pikar log dilli-mumbai kii dhakampel main laut aate hai
 Of course the market has hung hoardings of their advertisements on the Himalayas as well, but who can remain untouched by them and know only the Himalayas, they will be able to experience the deep humanity that is ingrained in the particles of nature

 The Bombay High Court has changed the sentence of 25-year-old Ankur Panwar in the Preity Rathi Tezaab attack case
 ab vah mrityudand kii jagah aaajeevan karawas main tabdeel kar diya he
 Explain that in the year 2013, Ankur Panwar, convicted in this case, was sentenced to death by a special court in 2015, against which Ankur filed a petition in the High Court
 is yachika ko nyaayamurti bi
 P
 dharmadhikari or nyaayamurti pi
 D
 nike kii khandpeeth ne aanshik rup se manzur kar liya he
 The special thing is that this is the first such case in which the court reduced the sentence of the accused
 peeth ne kaha ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhaaraon 302 (hatya) or 326 (bi) (tezaab kaa istemaal kar jaanboojhkar gambhir chot pahunchaana) ke tahat doshasiddhi ko barkaraar rakhaa gaya he
 It should be noted that accused Ankur chased 23-year-old nurse Preeti and threw acid on her, which caused her death during treatment
 police kii jaanch main pataa chalaa tha ki priti dilli se aa rahi train se 2 may 2013 ko bandra terminus par utari thi, tabhi ankur ne uske chehre par tezaab phenkaa tha
 Preeti's eyesight was also lost after this incident
 gauratlab he ki desh main adaalat dwaara aaropee kii sajaa ko badalane kaa yah koi pehla maamla nahin he
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had commuted the death sentence of the death sentence of the killer who killed three people in Chhattisgarh to life imprisonment
 is maamle par faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne maut kii sajaa ko vaid tehraaya tha
 The Supreme Court said that capital punishment is valid in the country and there is no need to consider it
 court ne kaha ki maut kii sajaa tabhi di ja sakati he, jab doshi ke sudharne kii koi gunjaish na ho
 The 45-year-old Chhannu Verma, who killed three people in Chhattisgarh, had challenged the death sentence given by the High Court in the Supreme Court
 hoicourt ne trial court ke faisle ko sahi maanate hue chhannu verma kii faansee kii sajaa ko sahi mana tha
 Let us tell you that on October 19, 2011, Ratna Bai (32 years old), her father-in-law Anandaram Sahu (56 years old) and mother-in-law Firantin Bai (55 years old) were stabbed to death by a resident of Borid village of Patan block
 jabaki purv jila panchayat sadsy mira banchor, uske pati channulaal banchor va gendlal verma par jaanaleva hamalaa kar ghayal kar diya tha
 In this case, the testimony of the deceased Ratna Bai's 9-year-old son Roshan alias Sonu was important
 roshan ne apni maa, daadi kii hatya hote dekhi thi
 Former district panchayat member Meera Banchore went to the house and told her that mother and grandmother had been killed by Channu Verma
 dhyaan ho ki chhannu verma ke khilaaf gaanv kii hi ek mahila ke saath balaatkaar kaa maamla darj tha
 Some of the dead and injured had testified in court against Channu Verma in the rape case
 ghatana ke kuch din pehle hi vah balaatkaar ke aarope se bari hokar gaanv lautaa tha
 He was displeased to testify against himself and killed three people systematically in retaliation
 vah gaanv ke ramswaroop ko bhi maarna chahta tha
 But he did not get it
 khatarnaak gangster guddu singh kii bihar main 8 sitambar ko virdohi gang ke sadasyon ne goli maar kar hatya kar di
 Guddu Singh was facing more than 25 cases of murder, train robbery, kidnapping and extortion
 use us vakt goli maari gai, jab vah patna se 50 kilometre dur sthit baadh kii ek adaalat main peshi ke baad bandi vaahan kii ore laut rahaa tha
 Two other prisoners were also injured in the incident of indiscriminate firing
 iske ek din baad court parisar main tainaat 25 pulicekarmiyon ko nilambit kar diya gaya
 Witnesses said the policemen ran away and did not fire a single shot in response
 hamalaavaron ke bhaag jane ke baad hi pulicekarmi waapas aae
 After this incident, the security arrangements have opened up again in lower courts in Bihar
 haalanki 2015 main aara jila adaalat main bam se hue hamale ke baad sarkaar ne sabhi adaalat parisaron ko electronic servilans se las karne kaa aadesh diya tha, iske baavjood baadh kii adaalat main abhi tak ek bhi sisitivi nahin lagaaya gaya he
 This is not the first incident of bomb attacks or shootings in court premises
 july 2013 main hajipur kii adaalat main pravesh kar rahi kaidiyon kii ek vine par do bam phenke gaye the, jisamen ek police consteble ghayal ho gaya tha
 In September 2014, two people were injured in a bomb blast that razed the Chapra court complex
 vahiin par april 2016 main hue ek or bam visphot main teen log ghayal ho gaye the
 In this incident, a criminal's female accomplice had himself brought a bomb to target a witness in the triple murder
 pichley saal 11 march ko sasaram court parisar ke baahar hue teen visphoton main paanch log ghayal ho gaye the or mujffarpur ke adaalat parisar main ek hatya aaropee ko goli maar di gai thi
 The extent was reached when Javed Ahmed, a civil court employee was shot dead in Samastipur last month
 adaalaton kii suraksha ke maamle main ek janhit yachika (piiel) par sangyaan lete hue patna hycourt ne bihar ke mukhya sachiv anjani kumaar singh ko yah nirdesh diya tha ki vah is maamle kii samiksha karen or isaki report adaalat ko den
 According to the 2015 report of the National Crime Records Bureau, inmates of Bihar jails had to be brought to the courts for 2,56,376 times that year
 ausatan dekhen to iskaa matlab yah niklaa ki har kaary diwas par kam se kam 821 baar kaidiyon ko adaalat parisaron main le janaa padataa he
 Clearly, there is a dire need to improve the security situation
 iske liye paryaapt sankhya main pulicekarmiyon kii tainaati ke alaava nyaayalay parisaron kii deevaaron ko durust karaane tak ke kaam karne honge
 Also, the entry of unauthorized persons will have to be strictly prohibited
 divilyrs kaa kahana tha ki shuruyaat main gend ko timming karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha

 In Jigaso village of Lalganj block in Rae Bareli district, Shukla's name is listed in the list of laborers in MGNREGA, it is different that most of them live in Rae Bareli
 badi-badi gadiyon ke maalik, hathiyaaron kii mahfuj panaah main rahane vaale shukla (job card number upi-33-013-017-004 / 274) ne jigaso gaanv main baqayada mahatma gandhi rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee adhinium (manaregaa) main kaam bhi kiya he
 Let us also mention here that the driver of these 'laborers' gentleman is also the head of the village
 shukla kaa daawa he ki manaregaa main milane vaala mehtaanaa ve garibon main baant dete the
 People like Shukla are getting rich work in MNREGA when only 3 in 2011-12 in the country
 08 fisadi job card dharak hi 100 din kii manaregaa mazdooree hasil kar paa rahe hai or isi vitt varsh main desh main ek bhi parivaar ko manaregaa kaa berogari bhatta nahin diya gaya
 Now take another example
 isi jile ke dalmau block ke dina kaa purava gaanv main rahete hai do buudhe
 One is named Mahavir and the other is Mars
 donon kii umr he 80 saal
 By the way, by seeing their appearance, it is known that poverty is flowing in their blood and the termites of unemployment have hollowed their bodies
 phir bhi balihaari angrejon ke jamaane se chali aa rahi babushahi kii ki inkaa manaregaa job card pichley 6 saal main bhi nahin ban sakaa
 And till the job card of the head of the family is not made, then it is not possible to become the card of the rest of the family
 mangal kii kachi tapariya girane ke kagaar par he or uske do bete aas-paas ke ilaake main majuri kar kisi tarah do june kii roti kaa jugad kar rahe hai
 Recently, on 4 May, the MNREGA to which Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh has named MNREGA-2 by adding 30 new works, the expectation of Mars is like this, "every year we request but no action is taken
" ab to bhukh se maut hi is jindagi se nijaat dilaaegi
 "at the same time, Mahavir is still somehow keeping his bigha off the ground
 yah haal us raibareli kaa he jisane uttar pradesh ke baaki jilon kii tulana main sabase behatar (4 fisadi) rojgaar diya he
 Is this not a dark city? agar he to chaupat raja or uske karinde bhi yaheen kahin malari khate dikh jaaenge
 Before we present the examples of this chatraparaja spread across Rae Bareli and the whole country, let us know where the money comes from and where it goes
 (dekhen box : parat dar parat bandarbaant)
 The money which eventually reaches the bank for any work under MNREGA is jointly in the name of the village head and the panchayat secretary
 kaam ke evaj main mazdooree kaa pement kaamgaar ke bank khate main kiya jaataa he
 In the Lalitpur district of the state, the work of officers has also come to the surface
 yahaan jiladhikari ne 100 karod ke ghotaale main jile ke pariyojna nideshak, kai pradhan, secretary, bidio or anya afasaron ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karvaa diya
 There should be no hurdle in the monkey fund of money, so the first attempt of the village head is to get the job cards of his followers and supporters first
 in logon se saamaanya taur par manaregaa kaa kaam nahin karaayaa jaataa par muster role main inaki dihadi bila naga darrj hoti he
 Bachulal Shukla, a freedom fighter from Rae Bareli, calls MNREGA a decentralization of corruption that has reached the village level
 shaayad yahi sab dekhakar pranav mukherjee ne manaregaa kaa bajet 40,000 karod ru
 33,000 crore from Rs
 kar diya he
 On the question of whether the basic structure of the MNREGA is not responsible for the corruption that has developed on such a large scale, Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain says 'aditya', "it is not right to reject the entire scheme on the basis of some irregularities
 is
 hamane khud jameen par jaakar gadabadiyaan pakadi hai
 At the same time, they do not forget to say that work is to be given to the MNREGA to the one who asks for work
 aise main agar kam log kaam maangane aa rahe hai to iskaa matlab he-unhen kahin or rojgaar mil rahaa he
 Apart from this, unemployment allowance is also available
 purv vitt mantri or varisht bhaajapa netaa yashavanth sinha is baat se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 "it is a very badly designed scheme," argues Sinha
 sarkaar ne ise hadabadi main banaaya or phir paisa jari karte chale gaye
 Now the situation has become uncontrollable and 100 days of employment is nowhere to be seen
 '' berogari bhatte par sinha kii do took tippanee he, ''jinke paas khaane ko paisa nahin he, ve sarkaar ke khilaaf berogari bhatte ke liye mukadmaa kya ladenge
 Although the figures of the official MGNREGA website also show that unemployment allowance of 25,48,480 days is to be given in 2011-12, but not a single day has been paid till now
 ab dekhie ve najiren jo bhrashtachar kii misaal hai
 There is an 80-foot-tall and 70-foot-wide pakariya pond in the village panchayat Ghurauna in Maharajganj block of Pokhara Rai Bareli on paper

 28 lakh rupees were spent on building the ideal pond
 asaliyat yah he ki talab ke naam par mahaj ek gaddha khuda he
 However, Pramod Kumar, the former head who built this pond, is not ready to say anything about it
 gaura block kii gaura khaspari gram panchayat ke severaha talab kii kahani or dalmau block ke dina kaa purava gaanv ke kailha talab kii kahani bhi aisi hi he
 a senior official of Rae Bareli Vikas Bhavan admits that MNREGA money has been misused on more than 300 ponds across the district
 isamen beete paanch varsho ke dauraan 100 karod ru
 Scam of more than can be revealed
 manaregaa main bhrashtachar ke khule khel par yojana ayog ke sadsy or manaregaa ke jaankaar mihir shah kehete hai, ''in aaropon ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 It is difficult to stop it on the emphasis of law
 logon main jaagrukta laana pehali or sabase jaruri cheez he
 "engineers are also not eating the money of Malaimnarega, only the head and the Panchayat Secretary are not monkeying
 jile main is yojana main takneekee sahaayak ke pad par kaam kar rahe kareeb 250 junior ejeeniyar bhi yojana ko chuunaa lagane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe
 Engineers are making boards at their shops and selling them to their own department at expensive prices
 aise hi ek junior ejeeniyar lakshmi shankar yadav hai jo raibareli ke dalmau block main tainaat hai
 In the main market Rana Nagar of the city, they have a shop for making iron goods called 'lakshmi Engineering Works'

 They are accused of Rs 1500

 '' Bastar is in disarray '' Let's consider the Bastar district of Chhattisgarh, which is among the most backward areas of the country
 yahaan farvab kaa dhandha aisa ki vittiya varsh 2011-12 main jile main mahaj do fisadi pariwaron ko hi sau din kaa rojgaar mil sakaa

 There is a strange sadness and the silence does not seem to break
 darasal yahaan manaravga kaa kaam puri tarah se thap he jo ki yahaan ke logon kii aajeevika kaa khaas jariya tha
 Sahato (25), sitting in his house, says that three years ago, he had worked with 50 people from the village for twenty days for the construction of the road, which has not been paid till the Adga
 met dirpal beete teen saal se kuch hi dinon main paisa dilwane kii baat kehete hue taalata aa rahaa he
 After this, many people of the village left the work of Manaravga
 isi gaanv ke dongaripara kaa vaaman (28) saal bhar se zyada samay se gaanv nahin lautaa he
 His wife Motley says that there is no news of the husband

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath visited the Taj Mahal and tried to calm the debate over it
 lekin lagata he ye mudda shant hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa he
 The Imam of the mosque at Taj Mahal, Sadiq Ali, while talking to Aaj Tak has said that the Taj Mahal cannot have Shiva Chalisa, because there is a mosque here
 unhone kaha ki kabristaan main shiv chalisa nahin ho sakati he, ye jo bhi vivaad ho rahaa he wo sahi nahin he
 The issue should be resolved through dialogue
 bataa den ki shuukravaar ko hirashtriya swayamsevak sanghake itihaas wing akhil bhartiya itihaas sankalan samiti (ABISS) ne apil kii thi ki tajmahal main shuukravaar ko hone vaali namaaz par roak laga di jaae
 Speaking to India Today, the National Secretariat Dr
 balmukund pandey ne kaha tha ki tajmahal ek rashtriya sampatti he, to use muslimon ko dharmik sthaan ke rup main istemaal karne kii ijaajat kyon di jaati he
 The process of offering Namaz at the Taj Mahal should be banned
 gauratlab he ki bijepi vidhayak sangeet som or bijepi netaa vinay katiyaar ke dwaara tajmahal ko lekar die gaye bayaan se lagaataar vivaad badhata ja rahaa tha
 Apart from this, some members of the Hindu Yuva Vahini performed Shiva Chalisa outside the Taj Mahal

 The victory of the Samajwadi Party will be the defeat of fascist and communal politics
 svachh raajnneeti ko milegaa baikhilesh ne kaha ki is jeet se desh-pradesh main svachh or naitik raajnneeti ko bal milegaa
 Defeating the disruptive forces in the local body elections will only ensure the bjp's way of getting eliminated from the Center in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki purvavarti sapa sarkaar ne paanch saalon ke apane kaarykaal main shaharon or gaanvon ke vikaas kii santulit yojanaayen lagu kii thim
 In contrast to the achievements of that government, the seven-month-old Yogi government of BJP did not do any work that can be mentioned
 akhilesh ne kaha ki janata kii nigaah mensamajawaadee sarkaarka kaam bolta he
 Therefore, SP is confident of its victory in local body elections

 ayodhya andolan se bijepi ko mili sanjivanigoli cond se mulaayam kii chhavi hindu virdohi baniram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle par in dinon desh kii siyasat garmai hui he or sabhi ko is par supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar he
 On this day 29 years ago, when Karsevaks were moving towards Babri Masjid, then the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav took a strict decision and ordered firing on the Karsevaks
 isamen paanch karsevakon kii maut ho gai thi
 This step of Mulayam Singh survived the Babri Masjid at that time, but the condition and direction of Indian politics changed forever
 bijepi ko yaheen se raajnneetik sanjivani mili
 While the image of Mulayam Singh Yadav became anti-hindu
 hinduvadi sanghathanon ne unhen 'mullah mulaayam' ke naam se nawaja
 This anti-hindu image is not yet completely removed from Mulayam Singh and his Samajwadi Party
 karsevakon par chali golibta den ki 90ke dashak main ayodhya andolan puure charam par tha or uttar pradesh kii satta kii kaman mulaayam singh yadav ke haath main thi
 Mulayam had said that while his chief minister, no one can kill Parinda at the Babri Masjid
 oktober, 1990 main hindu sadhu-santon karaseva ke liye ayodhya kooch kar rahe the
 On October 30, 1990, the mob of karsevaks went out of control
 karsevak police bairicading tod masjidki ore bad rahe the
 Taking a strict decision, Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered the administration to fire
 police kii goliyon se paanch karsevakon kii maut hui
 People were enraged due to the karsevaks killed on 30 October
 aasapaas ke gharon kii chhaton tak par bandookdhaari pulicekarmi tainaat the or kisi ko bhi babari masjid tak jane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 In such a situation, on 2 November 1990, once again thousands of kar sevaks reached close to Hanuman Garhi, the police had to shoot once again, in which about a dozen kar sevaks were killed
 desh kii ekta ke liye chalavaai goliayodhya main karsevakon par golicond ke 23 saal baad mulaayam singh yadav ne july 2013 main ajtak se baat karte hue kaha tha ki us samay mere saamne mandir-masjid or desh kii ekta kaa sawaal tha
 The people of BJP had raised a crowd of 11 lakh in Ayodhya in the name of Karseva
 desh kii ekta ke liye mujhe goli chalavaani padi
 Although i regret it, there was no other option
 'mulaayam singh ban gaye 'mullah mulaayam'mulaayam singh yadav ne apni sakhti se us samay babari masjid bhale hi bachaa lee, lekin isi ke baad se uttar pradesh se lekar desh kii siyasat hameshaa ke liye badal gai
 Due to this incident, the BJP and Hinduist organizations declared Mulayam Singhyadava as anti-hindu
 bijepi netaa apane bhaashanon main karsevakon par goli chalavane ke chalate mulaayam ko 'mullah mulaayam' kah kar sambodhit karte the
 Presenting him as an anti-hindu and anti-muslim leader
 mulaayam singh 29 saal ke baad bhi apni ye chhavi puri tarah tod nahin sake hai
 When the Lok Sabha elections were held in 1991, the BJP increased from 85 to 120 seats
 itnaa hi 1991 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav hua to mulaayam singh buree tarah haar gaye or bijepi purna bahumat ke saath sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 Kalyan Singh became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 1992 main karsevak ek baar phir se ayodhya main jutane lage 6 disambar 1992 ko vahi prashasan jo mulaayam ke daur main karsevakon ke saath sakhti barte tha, mookadarshak ban gaya
 The kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid
 kalyaan singh ne qurbaan kii sarkaarakalyan singh ne isaki naitik jimmedaari lete hue 6 disambar, 1992 ko hi mukhyamantri pad se tyaagptr de diya
 The second day the central government dismissed the BJP government of UP
 kalyaan singh ne us samay kaha tha ki ye sarkaar ram mandir ke naam par bani thi or uskaa makasad puraa hua
 In such a situation, the government sacrificed in the name of Ram temple
 upi kii kalyaan sarkaar bhale barkhaast ho gai ho, lekin bijepi kii raajnneeti ko desh bhar main sanjivani de gai
 BJP was formed from Ram temple to Sanjeevani in 1980 and only after the formation of the party did it openly take the front of the Ram temple movement
 bijepi ke gathan ke 4 saal baad chunaav hue to party ke keval do saansad jite
 In 1989, the BJP decided to give a boost to the Ram Mandir movement at the Palampur session
 udhar rajeev gandhi ne vivaadit sthal ke paas ram mandir kaa shilanyas karne kii ijaajat de di
 BJP also benefited from this
 bijepi 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 2 seat se badhkar 85 par pahunch gai
 In March 1990, BJP governments were formed in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 babari masjid vidhwans ke baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko jabardast raajnneetik phayda mila
 BJP increased from 85 seats to 120 seats
 iske baad 1996 main chunaav main hue to centre main bijepi sarkaar bani haalanki ye mahaj 13 din chali
 After this, in 1998 and 1999, the government was formed under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which lasted till 2004

 ) In Bihar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has stepped up the search for its new president
 nityanand raay philhal adhyaksh pad par kabiz hai lekin modi sarkaar 2
 He has been crowned as a minister in 0
 ek vyakti, ek pad ke formule ke tahat jald hi ve bijepi pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad chhod sakate hai
 In such a situation, the search for new faces has started
 bihar main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 In any case, BJP wants to win the political battle of assembly elections like Lok Sabha
 isliye vakt rahete kisi nae adhyaksh ko kaman saunp di jaae, isaki koshish tej ho gai he
 Now the question is, what powerful face will the BJP bring to the table, which can mobilize votes by applying caste equations? In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP mobilized the Dalits, Backwards and Forwards together in Bihar and smashed the opposition mobilization
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi apana nayaa adhyaksh usee ko bananaa chaahati he, jo pradesh ke jaateey or saamaajik sameekaran ko saadhane main feet baithta ho
 Not only this, along with organizational experience, the union should also be reliable
 lihaaja yah jimmedaari aise kisi netaa ko di ja sakati he, jiske naam par kisi tarah kaa vivaad na ho or na hi party main kisi prakaar kii khmebandi ho sake
 The upper caste factor matters, this time there are many leaders who have been dropped from the Modi cabinet
 in netaaon ne achche khaase voton se chunaav jeeta lekin modi cabinet main jagah nahin bana paae
 The leaders include Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Radha Mohan Singh
 iske alaava janardan singh sigrival jaise netaa ko is baar phir modi cabinet main jagah nahin mili he
 The profile of Janardan Singh Sigriwal in front of Rudy and Radha Mohan Singh is slightly lighter, but given the clean image of the party, the party can also bet on him
 sabase bada factor sanghathan se judaav or kshetra main jansampark kaa aadhaar adhyaksh pad kii dasha disha tay karegaa
 In this sense, Rudy's stature seems to be heavier, as he has an assertive image as a national spokesperson
 saath hi padhe likhe or sanghathan se ekajutata ke alaava ve party adhyaksh amit shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke achche kareebi maane jate hai
 His image as a youth leader is well established
 ise dekhte hue rudi ko bijepi adhyaksh ke taur par aajamaaya ja saktaa he
 The next name is of Radhamohan Singh
 kai baar loksabhaa chunaav jeet kar sansad pahunche radhamohan singh bihar ke sanghathan par acchhee pakad rakhte hai
 Radha Mohan Singh, who has been closely associated with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Jana Sangh and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has already held the party in Bihar
 iske saath hi puure 5 saal krishi mantralay main inhone sevaayen di hai
 In view of his full tenure and affiliation with the party organization, he is being named prominently for the post of president
 haalanki krishi mantri rahete hue jis tarah se kisaan andolan hue hai, uske chalate unhen mantri pad nahin diya gaya
 In such a situation, it is not easy to say that he should be crowned as the party president
 aise savarna jo sansad main nahin hambihar bijepi main kuch aise savarna netaa bhi hai jo dilli se dur bihar main party kaa kaamkaaj dekhte hai
 There is a strong discussion of names like Mithilesh Tiwari and Mangal Pandey
 mithilesh tiwari pradesh upaadhyaksh hai or pradeshik sanghathan se unke achche taalluk hai
 In TV debates, the party favors them well, so their face is considered to be known among the people
 iske alaava aglaa naam mangal pandey kaa he jo pehle bhi adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 During his tenure, the party worked hard and went ahead with strength
 himachal or jharkhand main bhi ve bijepi ko acchhee kamyaabi dilaa chuke hai
 However, the factor of chum fever has gone against him because this disease took many lives while under his health minister, which has caused a lot of disgrace for this ministry
 rajput birdari kii ahmiyatrajiv pratap rudi kaa naam chal rahaa tha ki unhen sarkaar main jagah milegi lekin modi sarkaar ke duusare kaarykaal main inhen jagah nahin mili
 In such a situation, it is discussed that he can be given the command of the state president
 yuva matadaataaon ke bich bhi unki pakad he
 The BJP can choose a leader from this community, as the Rajput community has been associated with the RJD for a long time and the way the BJP has entered the camp after Lalu Yadav's jail, the party is in no way Don't want to distance yourself from him

 Kuldeep Sengar was arrested by the CBI on April 13, 2018 on charges of rape
 iske baad se hi hathiyaar license ko radd karne kii kavayad shuru ho gai thi
 Sengar's dominance in the administration was not reduced, then the biggest example of this is his license not being revoked in 15 months

 This court order has increased the trouble of former BJP leader and MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, accused in the case

 But till date there was no action on this report of the police

 These people have targeted Hindu religion

 Chief Justice Justice Deepak Mishra said on this entire case that, we will only hear constitutional aspects and will not do anything else
 bataa den, senior edwocket radhakrishnan ne kaha ki yachikakarta aise log hai jinaki bhagwaan ayappa main koi ruchi nahin hai
 This petition has been made only to attack the dignity of the temple

 ) sawaal khud se poochna chahie ki kya ham har haal main hinsa kii samskruti ke kilaaf hai
 If you are speaking against all kinds of violence
 akhir kyon he ki police or adaalat ke rahete hue kai sanghathan gale main kaa patta daalkar khaane se lekar pahanaave kii talaashi lene lagate hai
 Why people start killing doctors directly if they miss treatment
 kanoon apane haath main lene lagate hai
 Do they not believe in police investigation
 bheed banaakar police par dabaav daalane kaa virodh or bheed banakar astapaalon par hamalaa karne kaa virodh, donon hona chahie
 Otherwise doctors will be scared in one place and girls in another place
 haalat ye he ki sadak par chalati car main karonch aane par chaalak duusari car ke chaalak ko maar maar kar adhamra kar detaa he
 Where is this anger coming from? bataa rahaa he ki ham biimaar hai
 Socially as well as politically
 jaipur ke ek restraan ko kuch logon kii bheed ne gher liya jabaki vahaan police thi
 It was suspected that beef meat was being sold there, while the restaurant owner said that it is not selling
 jabaki ek saal pehle pradhanmantri ne dilli ne kaha tha ki gau raksha ke naam par kuch log apni dukaane khol kar baith gaye hai
 i get so angry
 maine dekha he ki kuch log jo puri raat anti soshal activity karte hai lekin din main gau rakshak kaa chola pahan lete hai
 i request the State Governments to prepare dossiers of those who are voluntary, who consider cow protector, seventy eight percent will go out in a way that society does not accept
 hamen nahin maaloom jaipur ke restra main jin logon ne hamalaa kiya wo gau raksha ke naam par dukaan chalaane vaale nakli log hai yaa asli gau rakshak hai
 Whether the state government has complied with the Prime Minister's talk, has prepared a dossier or file of such organization
 pradhanmantri ko bhi poochna chahie ki 7 agast 2016 ke unke bayaan ke baad rajya sarkaron ne sattar assi fisadi nakli gau rakshakon kii koi file banaai he yaa nahin
 When the violence of the crowd starts to be recognized, the man alone starts thinking of himself as a mob
 tabhi to shivasena ke ek saansad sahab air india ke karmchaaree ko chappalon se peetane lagate hai
 The MP starts killing the employee in the ship
 puri duniya ke saamne kah rahe hai ki unhone maaraa he
 If their reasons are true, do they have any leeway that they can beat someone with slippers
 saansad sahab ko koi pachhtaawaa nahin he
 Tell the journalists that you too watch the film
 main bhi film dekhne chalaa gaya tha
 'badrinath Ki Dulhania' was watching
 in saansad sahab ko isliye fark nahin padataa kyonki unhen pataa he ki unke paas bheed he
 Which will be deposited in the name of party, in the name of religion or in the name of culture, and the police will keep watching as they keep on watching
 kya ham samuhik rup se hinsa or bheed kii samskruti ke kilaaf hai? kya ham hinsa se pehle kaaran ko samajhane kii prakriya main vishwaas rakhte hai? maharashtra main pichley do saal main 53 doctoron par hamalaa hua he, ek maamle main bhi sazaa nahin hui he
 Not only Maharashtra, violence with doctors is happening in many states
 magar jaanch or sazaa kaa alam yahi he
 The Dhule incident has shaken the doctors
 aisi sthiti main koi doctor kaise kaam karegaa
 Why 45000 resident doctors were forced to go on mass leave in protest
 avkaash par jane ke baad doctor to suspend kar diye jate hai, court se fatkaar mil jaati he, lekin kya ham jaanate hai ki ek resident doctor kis dabaav main kaam karata he
 How many hours works kyon resident doctor hi hinsa ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 Have you heard and seen any way to reduce or improve the pressure of patients on them and the hospital? hua he to uske kya nattejey rahe hai kya koi is bahes main ye sab tathy saamne laa rahaa he
 Is the resident doctor responsible for the system or is he facing the punishment for any mistake
 darasal kisi ke paas itnaa dhiraj nahin bachaa he samajhane sunne kaa
 Just shoot
 maar kar gussa nikaalo
 Doctors in many hospitals in India have agreed with the doctors in Maharashtra
 dilli main bhi aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 So the doctors of AIIMS expressed their opposition by wearing helmets
 doctoron ko hadtaal yaa samuhik avkaash par nahin janaa chahie
 If it is agreed upon but why is there no security for them
 iskaa samaadhaan sisitivi yaa suraksha hi he yaa kuch or he
 Why patients are impatient
 kya mahange ilaaj ke kaaran, kya ilaaj kii tatkaal suvidha nahin hone ke kaaran
 Why are we not asking this question on behalf of patients? tippaniyan The Doctors' Protection Act, 2010 was enacted in 2010 in Maharashtra
 iske tahat doctoron kii hinsa ko gair jamaanti aparaadh banaaya gaya tha
 Three years in prison and 50,000 fine was fixed
 hinsa karne waalon ko bhi aspataal ke upkarnon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kerani hogi
 Even after this act, not one in 53 incidents of violence have been punished in two years
 doctoron ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main bhi shikaayat kii he
 Have also met the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ek do kadam se vyavastha main sudhaar nahin ho rahaa he
 There has been no improvement in the condition of doctors
 mukhyamantri is bahes main janata ke paise or tex kaa masalaa le aa rahe hai lekin sawaal to kuch or he
 According to a study by the Indian Medical Association, 75 percent of doctors at the workplace have experienced violence
 pichley paanch saalon main doctoron par hamalaa badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Seeing the reaction of the government, the court and the relatives of the patients, it seems that what kind of trust is maintained in the public towards the doctors
 is bahes main yah sawaal bhi zaruri he ki kahin mariz or uske parijan mahangi ilaaj or aspataalon main bheed ke liye doctor ko to doshi nahin maan rahe hai
 Why doctors demonstrate their unity only with the question of safety
 duusare sawaalon ko lekar ve kyon nahin aage aate hai
 Why there is a ruckus about ICU
 kyon nahin isiu kii sankhya badhaai ja sakati he
 Does the general public know that under which rule the bed is found in the ICU or emergency, there can be no change in that rule, whether it is at the discretion of the doctor which patient needs the operation or ICU first, then Even if the ICU is not empty, what should it do, is it all set, does the hospital tell this to the public
 bahut role soochnaaon kii kami kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 All these questions came up while reading an online magazine called Lexicon, which is run by students studying medicine
 unhone hi mujhe ek mail bheja tha
 a restaurant in Jaipur was surrounded by a crowd of some people while the police were there
 shaq tha ki vahaan gau maance bik rahaa he jabaki restraan maalik kaa kahana tha ki nahin bik rahaa he
 Whereas, a year ago, the Prime Minister said that some people have opened their shops in the name of cow protection
 mujhe itnaa gussa aata he
 i have seen that some people who do anti social activity all night but wear cow protector during the day
 main rajya sarkaron ko anurodh karata hum aise jo swanyasevi hai jo gau rakshak maanate hai unka dosier taiyaar karo, sattar assi fisadi aise gaurakhdhandha karte hue niklenge jinhen samaaj sweekaar nahin karata he
 We do not know that the people who attacked the restaurant in Jaipur are fake people who run shops in the name of cow protection or are real cow guards
 rajya sarkaar ne pradhanmantri kii baat kaa paalan karte hue aise sanghathan kaa koi dosier yani file taiyaar kii he yaa nahin
 The Prime Minister should also ask whether, after his statement of 7 August 2016, the state governments have made a file of seventy eighty percent fake cow guards
 bheed kii hinsa ko jab manyata dene lagate hai to akelaa aadmi bhi khud ko bheed samajhane lagata he
 That is why a Shiv Sena MP starts beating Air India employee with slippers
 saansad sahab bhare jahaaz main karmchaaree ko maarane lagate hai
 They are saying in front of the whole world that they have killed
 unke kaaran sahi bhi honge to kya unhen chhot he ki ve kisi ko chappalon se peet sakate hai
 The MP has no regrets
 patrakaron se kehete hai ki tum bhi film dekho
 i also went to see the film
 'badrinath kii dulhaniya' dekh rahe the
 These mps do not mind because they know that they have a crowd
 jo party ke naam par, dharm ke naam par yaa samskruti ke naam par jamaa ho jaaegi or police vaise hi dekhte rahegi jaise wo dekhte rahati he
 Are we collectively against violence and mob culture? Do we believe in the process of understanding the cause before violence? In Maharashtra, 53 doctors have been attacked in the last two years, not a single case has been sentenced
 maharashtra hi nahin, doctoron ke saath hinsa to kai rajyon main ho rahi he
 But this is the way of investigation and punishment
 dhule kii ghatana ne to doctoron ko hilaa diya he
 How would a doctor work in such a situation
 kyon iske virodh main 45000 resident doctor samuhik avkaash par jane ke liye majaboor hue
 After going on leave, the doctors are suspended, the court gets reprimanded, but do we know what pressure a resident doctor works under
 kitne ghante kaam karata he
 Why resident doctors are falling victim to violence
 kya unke or aspataal par marizon ke dabaav ko kam karne yaa behatar karne kaa koi upaay aapane suna or dekha he
 If this has happened, what are the consequences of this? Is anyone bringing all these facts in this debate? kya resident doctor hi system ke liye zimmedaar he yaa kisi kii galati kii sazaa wo bhugat rahaa he
 Actually, no one has this much patience to listen to understand
 bas maaro
 Get angry by killing bharat ke kai aspataalon ke doctoron ne maharashtra ke doctoron se apni sahmati jataai he
 Such incidents also happen in Delhi
 isliye ames ke doctoron ne helmet pahanakar apana virodh jataayaa
 Doctors should not go on strike or group leave
 agar is par sahmati he lekin unki suraksha ke intazaam kyon nahin he
 The solution is CCTV or security or something
 kyon mariz besabr ho rahe hai
 Whether due to expensive treatment, not due to immediate treatment
 ham marizon kii taraf se yah sawaal kyon nahin puch rahe hai
 The comments maharashtra main 2010 main Doctors' Protection Act, 2010 bana tha
 Under this, the violence of doctors was made a non-bailable offense
 teen saal kii jail or 50,000 jurmaana tay hua tha
 Those who commit violence will also have to compensate for the loss of hospital equipment
 is act ke baad bhi do saal main 53 hinsa kii ghatnaon main ek main bhi sazaa nahin hui he
 Doctors have also complained in the Prime Minister's Office
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri se bhi mili hai
 Doctors say that the system is not improving with one or two steps
 doctoron kii sthiti main koi sudhaar nahin hua he
 The Chief Minister is bringing up the issue of public money and tax in this debate, but the question is something else
 indian medical association ke adhyayan ke anusaar kaarysthal par 75 fisadi doctoron ne hinsa kaa saamana kiya he
 In the last five years, the attack on doctors has been increasing
 sarkaar, adaalat or marizon ke parijanon kii pratikriya dekhakar yahi lagata he ki public main doctoron ke prati kis prakaar kaa vishwaas kaayam he
 In this debate, it is also important to question whether the patients and their relatives are not blaming the doctor for expensive treatment and congestion in hospitals
 kyon doctor apni ekta kaa pradarshan sirf suraksha ke sawaal ko lekar karte hai
 Why don't they come forward with other questions
 kyon isiu ko lekar hangaamaa hota he
 Why can't the number of icus be increased
 kya aam janata jaanati he ki isiu yaa immergency main bistar kis niyam ke tahat miltaa he, us niyam main koi badlaav nahin ho saktaa he, kya doctor ke vivek par hota he ki kis mariz ko sabase pehle aaparishan yaa isiu kii zarurat he, iske baad bhi isiu khaali na ho to use kya karnaa chahie, kya ye sab tay he, kya aspataal janata ko yah baat bataata he
 There may also be a lack of role information

 kya ham samuhik rup se hinsa or bheed kii samskruti ke kilaaf hai? kya ham hinsa se pehle kaaran ko samajhane kii prakriya main vishwaas rakhte hai? maharashtra main pichley do saal main 53 doctoron par hamalaa hua he, ek maamle main bhi sazaa nahin hui he
 Not only Maharashtra, violence with doctors is happening in many states
 magar jaanch or sazaa kaa alam yahi he
 The Dhule incident has shaken the doctors
 aisi sthiti main koi doctor kaise kaam karegaa
 Why 45000 resident doctors were forced to go on mass leave in protest
 avkaash par jane ke baad doctor to suspend kar diye jate hai, court se fatkaar mil jaati he, lekin kya ham jaanate hai ki ek resident doctor kis dabaav main kaam karata he
 How many hours works kyon resident doctor hi hinsa ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 Have you heard and seen any way to reduce or improve the pressure of patients on them and the hospital? hua he to uske kya nattejey rahe hai kya koi is bahes main ye sab tathy saamne laa rahaa he
 Is the resident doctor responsible for the system or is he facing the punishment for any mistake
 darasal kisi ke paas itnaa dhiraj nahin bachaa he samajhane sunne kaa
 Just shoot

 Doctors in many hospitals in India have agreed with the doctors in Maharashtra
 dilli main bhi aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai
 So the doctors of AIIMS expressed their opposition by wearing helmets
 doctoron ko hadtaal yaa samuhik avkaash par nahin janaa chahie
 If it is agreed upon but why is there no security for them
 iskaa samaadhaan sisitivi yaa suraksha hi he yaa kuch or he
 Why patients are impatient
 kya mahange ilaaj ke kaaran, kya ilaaj kii tatkaal suvidha nahin hone ke kaaran
 Why are we not asking this question on behalf of patients? tippaniyan The Doctors' Protection Act, 2010 was enacted in 2010 in Maharashtra
 iske tahat doctoron kii hinsa ko gair jamaanti aparaadh banaaya gaya tha
 Three years in prison and 50,000 fine was fixed
 hinsa karne waalon ko bhi aspataal ke upkarnon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kerani hogi
 Even after this act, not one in 53 incidents of violence have been punished in two years
 doctoron ne pradhanmantri karyaalay main bhi shikaayat kii he
 Have also met the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki ek do kadam se vyavastha main sudhaar nahin ho rahaa he
 There has been no improvement in the condition of doctors
 mukhyamantri is bahes main janata ke paise or tex kaa masalaa le aa rahe hai lekin sawaal to kuch or he
 According to a study by the Indian Medical Association, 75 percent of doctors at the workplace have experienced violence
 pichley paanch saalon main doctoron par hamalaa badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Seeing the reaction of the government, the court and the relatives of the patients, it seems that what kind of trust is maintained in the public towards the doctors
 is bahes main yah sawaal bhi zaruri he ki kahin mariz or uske parijan mahangi ilaaj or aspataalon main bheed ke liye doctor ko to doshi nahin maan rahe hai
 Why doctors demonstrate their unity only with the question of safety
 duusare sawaalon ko lekar ve kyon nahin aage aate hai
 Why there is a ruckus about ICU
 kyon nahin isiu kii sankhya badhaai ja sakati he
 Does the general public know that under which rule the bed is found in the ICU or emergency, there can be no change in that rule, whether it is at the discretion of the doctor which patient needs the operation or ICU first, then Even if the ICU is not empty, what should it do, is it all set, does the hospital tell this to the public
 bahut role soochnaaon kii kami kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 All these questions came up while reading an online magazine called Lexicon, which is run by students studying medicine

 Doctors should not go on strike or group leave
 agar is par sahmati he lekin unki suraksha ke intazaam kyon nahin he
 The solution is CCTV or security or something
 kyon mariz besabr ho rahe hai
 Whether due to expensive treatment, not due to immediate treatment
 ham marizon kii taraf se yah sawaal kyon nahin puch rahe hai
 The comments maharashtra main 2010 main Doctors' Protection Act, 2010 bana tha
 Under this, the violence of doctors was made a non-bailable offense
 teen saal kii jail or 50,000 jurmaana tay hua tha
 Those who commit violence will also have to compensate for the loss of hospital equipment
 is act ke baad bhi do saal main 53 hinsa kii ghatnaon main ek main bhi sazaa nahin hui he
 Doctors have also complained in the Prime Minister's Office
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri se bhi mili hai
 Doctors say that the system is not improving with one or two steps
 doctoron kii sthiti main koi sudhaar nahin hua he
 The Chief Minister is bringing up the issue of public money and tax in this debate, but the question is something else

 In the last five years, the attack on doctors has been increasing
 sarkaar, adaalat or marizon ke parijanon kii pratikriya dekhakar yahi lagata he ki public main doctoron ke prati kis prakaar kaa vishwaas kaayam he
 In this debate, it is also important to question whether the patients and their relatives are not blaming the doctor for expensive treatment and congestion in hospitals
 kyon doctor apni ekta kaa pradarshan sirf suraksha ke sawaal ko lekar karte hai
 Why don't they come forward with other questions
 kyon isiu ko lekar hangaamaa hota he
 Why can't the number of icus be increased
 kya aam janata jaanati he ki isiu yaa immergency main bistar kis niyam ke tahat miltaa he, us niyam main koi badlaav nahin ho saktaa he, kya doctor ke vivek par hota he ki kis mariz ko sabase pehle aaparishan yaa isiu kii zarurat he, iske baad bhi isiu khaali na ho to use kya karnaa chahie, kya ye sab tay he, kya aspataal janata ko yah baat bataata he

 sinha kii raay main ye is baat kaa saboot he ki samaajawaadee party bhrashtachar or aparaadh ko panaah de rahi he
 According to Sinha, the internal quarrel of the Samajwadi Party was the exercise to shine the image of Akhilesh Yadav
 unka aarope tha ki sattadhari party upi kii janata kaa dhyaan asal muddon se bhatkaakar mukhyamantri ko vijeta ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi he

 The devastation caused by nature's destruction on Devbhoomi is not taking the name of stopping
 kedarnath to pehle hi puri tarah se tabah ho chukaa he or ab chaar dham kii yatra ke pehle padaav yamunotri par bhi sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai
 Pooja has already stopped due to the cracks lying in the temple and there are no chances of its reopening
 uttarakhand par aisi qayaamat barsi ki sab kuch tahas-nahas ho gaya
 Their tributaries, including the Ganges and Yamuna, took such a form of rage that the entire course of the Char Dham Yatra changed
 chaar dham kii yatra main padane vaala pehla padaav yamunotri, jise yamuna kaa udgam sthal mana jaataa he or yaheen bane yamunotri mandir main bhi kurdat kaa kahar tutaa he
 From the floor of the temple to its walls, there are signs of destruction
 maa yamuna ke udgam sthal par aisi tabaahi kii kalpana kisi ne nahin kii thi
 The situation is that now the temple administration is also warning about the danger of performing the common rituals of worship in the temple and the movement of devotees again in the temple
 gauratlab he ki dharm granthon main yamuna ko bhagwaan surya kii beti or yama kii bahan kaha gaya he or manyata he ki jo bhi bhakt shraddhapurvak yamuna main snaan karata he un bhakton ko yama koi yatnaa nahin dete hai
 This is the reason that on Akshaya Tritiya, the temple is opened for the worship of devotees and is closed after the holy festival of brotherhood
 chaar dham ke sambandh main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ye vahi pavitra sthaan he jahaan prithvi or swarg ekaakaar hote hai
 Pilgrims first start their journey from Yamunotri and visit Gangotri during this journey
 yahaan se pavitra jal lekar shraddhalu kedareshwar par jalabhishek karte hai
 Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath are the most sacred shrines of Hindus
 dharmagranthon main kaha gaya he ki jo manushya yahaan ke darshan karne main safal hote hai, unke na keval is janm ke paap dhul jate hai balki wo jivan-maran ke bandhan se bhi mukt ho jate hai
 But the devastation caused by the cloudburst and heavy rainfall on 16 and 17 June not only halted the journey to Char Dham but thousands of people died in death
 badrinaath main bhi machi tabaahi
 
 
 Shiva is considered the god of destruction
 usee shiv yani kedarnath ke dham main maut ne sailaab par aisa tandav kiya ki bhakthi sihar uthi
 But the alarm of destruction was knocked down even at the rate of Lord Vishnu
 shiv kii aradhana ke baad bhakt bhagwaan vishnu kii puja-archana ke liye badrinaath jate hai
 On the night of 16 July, when the sky broke over a large area of uttarakhand, at that time thousands of devotees were present in Badrinath also to see their worship, but Badrinath also broke the ties with other parts of the country
 hajaaron bhakt jahaan ke tahaan funs gaye
 Still felt that the situation would soon come under control
 lekin ek baar phir se bhayankar barish kii aahat or duusari tabaahiyon ke saae main badrinaath kii yatra bhi sambhav nahin dikhti
 When Sankata Ganga started taking such a boom, he was bent on ruining everything, then it became difficult for the devotees to see the Gangotri, the center of Ganga, which is the center of Ganga
 vaise to ganga akele hi pralay le ai lekin yamuna main bhi aisa ufaan aayaa ki yamunotri kii yatra bhi khatre main pad gai
 Delhi Police is using Bhojpuri to convey its message to the common people

 With the announcement in Bhojpuri language, for the first time, Delhi Police has targeted a particular community
 uttar pradesh, bihar, jharkhand or pashchim bengal ko jane vaali railgadiyon main jaharkhurani giroh dwaara nasha khilaakar luutane ke kai maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 The gang befriends passengers waiting for trains or people standing in queues at ticket windows
 vah logon se hindi, bhojpuri yaa bangla bhashaa main baat karata he
 Soon the conversation and laughter turn into offers of tea or biscuits or soft drinks
 yatri ko andeh nahin hota or vah nasha mili chaay yaa biscuit gatak jaataa he or jaldi hi behosh ho jaataa he
 By the time he regains consciousness, his valuables have disappeared and even his unfamiliar friend has disappeared
 police upayukta (railway) sanjay bhaatia ne is babat kaha, 'kai yatri is gambhir samasya ko jhel chuke hai
 This gang recognizes such innocent people
