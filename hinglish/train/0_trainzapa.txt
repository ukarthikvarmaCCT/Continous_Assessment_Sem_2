 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this renunciation is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India

 Apart from all these facilities, i would like to clarify that there will be no interruption in the entire process in non-cash transactions ie payment by check, payment by demand draft, debit or credit card payment or electronic fund transfer
 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this renunciation is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen

 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite

 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 in sari suvidhaon ke alaava main yah spasht karnaa chaahunga ki is puri prakriya main non-cash len dein main yani check se pement, demand draft se pement, debit yaa credit card se pement athwa electronic fund transafar main koi rukaawat nahin aegi
 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this renunciation is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment

 in sari suvidhaon ke alaava main yah spasht karnaa chaahunga ki is puri prakriya main non-cash len dein main yani check se pement, demand draft se pement, debit yaa credit card se pement athwa electronic fund transafar main koi rukaawat nahin aegi
 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this renunciation is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India

 Apart from all these facilities, i would like to clarify that there will be no interruption in the entire process in non-cash transactions ie payment by check, payment by demand draft, debit or credit card payment or electronic fund transfer
 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you

 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is being eaten like a termite to our political, social and administrative life
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa

 bharat mata kii jai
 When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum

 The SIT investigation, which was shocking, wanted to sell pornographic videos of the revelers and talked to the leaders of the opposition and the gang as the investigation of the Honey Trap case of Madhya Pradesh is proceeding
 har roj nae khulaase ho rahe hai
 Two of the five women caught in this high-profile scandal tried to sell videos of intimate relationships of several big leaders during the Lok Sabha elections for Rs 30 crore
 len-dein ko lekar kuch netaaon se in mahilaon kii kai daur kii baatcheet bhi hui thi
 The sources of the two parties had asked for the money
 Sources in an agency say that these women had reduced their interference in the new government after the change of power in the state after the assembly elections, so these women had led many leaders of the ruling party Congress and the opposition on the other hand
 The party kept in touch with BJP leaders
 in mahilaon ne donon dalon ke kai netaaon ke video hone kaa daawa karte hue manachaahi rakam maangi, jab baat nahin bani to unhone netaaon se vyaktigat sampark kiya
 According to the deal information was being made for 6 crores, a video of a leader of Bhopal was also made by these women and based on that video, they tried to deal with the video of leaders of both BJP and Congress parties
 sutara bataate hai ki ek raajnneetik dal ke netaa kai video chah karod rupee main kharidne ko raji bhi ho gaye the, magar mahilaayein or unke kareebi log 30 karod rupee se kam par thok video bechney ko taiyaar nahin the
 The demand for large sums of money spoiled the sportspersons saying that these women were mistaken that people associated with political parties would buy their videos at the desired price, as they could affect the image of other party leaders
 lekin maangi gai rakam bahut zyada hone ke kaaran koi bhi lene ke liye raji nahin hua
 Police had an eye on women
 If you believe the people involved with political parties, then the video deal of these women could not be done during the election
 uske baad in mahilaon ne sidhe sambandhit netaaon se sampark banaakar chhot-moti rakam anthi
 At the same time, after the election, the police department and government people started keeping an eye on them, because the news of these women having videos of many big people was revealed

 In fact, in order to establish peace in Jammu and Kashmir, the Ministry of Home Affairs had stopped the operation against terrorists till Eid
 haalanki ise ghati main halaat sudhare nahin or tabadatod aatanki hamale hue
 It is being called Ramadanzizfire
 ab id aane ko he
 Hence, the government reviewed this decision earlier
 guuruuvaar ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne is masale par badi baithak bulaai, jisamen sijafire jari rakhane yaa hataane par charchaa hui
 Now only after June 17 will it be known whether the military operation and the ceasefire will continue in Jammu and Kashmir
 sabaki najar is baat par he ki kya sarkaar sijafire ko amarnath yatra tak badhayegi yaa nahin?ab 17 june ke baad hi pataa chalegaa ki jammu-kashmir main sainya oparation or sijafire jari rahegaa yaa nahin
 Everyone is eyeing whether the government will extend the ceasefire till Amarnath Yatra or not? It is being told that many big officials including Union Ministers Jitendra Singh, Hansraj Ahir were involved in this meeting
 bataa den ki haal hi main rajnath singh ne do din kaa jammu-kashmir daura kiya tha, jahaan unhone halaat kaa jayja liya tha
 Now today, Union Home Minister Rajnath will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mana ja rahaa he ki wo piem modi ko kashmir par halaat kii jaankaree denge
 Also, we can discuss the issue of ceasefire

 The ruling BJP MLA said that Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh's decision to stop the operation in Kashmir is wrong

 He said that Home Minister Rajnath Singh's decision to cease fire is wrong

 rahul ko adhyaksh pad viraasat main mila he, lekin wo is janm main pradhanmantri nahi ban paaenge, kyonki desh kii janata unhen viraasat nahin saunpegi
 It is possible that within the coming six months, one of India's most ambitious fighter aircraft development programs will face an atmosphere of confusion for its survival
 sambhaavna he ki disambar main raksha mantralay is baat par faisla karegaa ki swadesh-nirmit halke ladaaku vimaan 'tejas' ke vimanavahak pot se ud sakane or us par utarane yogya sanskaran ko viksit karne kaa kaam band kar diya jaae, yaa usamen nivesh jari rakhaa jaae
 The government has already allocated Rs 3,500 crore to develop this fighter aircraft, and now needs a clear answer
 kya tejas-en kaa prototip, jiskaa pareekshan is vakt kiya ja rahaa he, aise vimaan kaa rup le sakegaa, jo pot se ud sake, us par utar sake, or hind mahaasaagar ke ilaake main ubhar rahe khataron se nipatane main sakasham ho? or kya is prototip ke atyaadhunik sanskaran, jinhen LCA-N Mk-2 kaha ja rahaa he, paanch se saat saal ke nishchit samay ke bheetar viksit, nirmit or tainaat kiye ja sakate hai? Now that there is no option but to increase the pace of the development program, a small core team of pilots, engineers and design-team members of the Indian Navy, Aeronautical Design Agency (ADA) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) are willing to live It is working that the important goals can be completed in time
 is vakt inamen sabase bada lakshya he 260 kilometre (140 nots) se kuch hi kam raftaar se udne vaale saadhe das ton ke ladaaku vimaan kaa samudratat par maujuud vimanavahak pot ke deck kii nakal par tezi se jhukna, utarana, apane fuzlage par lage hook ke zariye ranve par maujuud aresting vir ko pakadana, or sirf 90 meter kii duuri ke bheetar ruk janaa sunishchit ho sake
 This is all it takes to make an 'arrested Landing' on the deck of any aircraft carrier, which so far has been able to do only a handful of fighter aircraft, developed by the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and more recently China
 goa main samudratat par bani test facility main is pareekshan kaa baar-baar safal hona hi sabit karegaa ki LCA-N sabase ahm dizine feechar - kisi bhi vimanavahak pot ke deck par 'arested landing' ke jabaav ko yah vimaan jhel saktaa he - bilkul sahi kaam kar rahaa he
 Only when these seaside trials are successful will naval pilots heading the development program for the prototype of the LCA-N be able to take the next step - that is to actually land it on India's only operational aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya
 LCA-N vikaas team ke jude ahm sadasyon ne NDTV se baatcheet main bataaya ki unhone pichley lagbhag ek maheene ke dauraan goa test facility main 60 baar udaan bhari he, or monsoon ke khatm hote hi ahm landing trial shuru kar dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 To get the aircraft on the deck of INS Vikramaditya, LCA-N engineers and pilots have to be convinced that the aircraft 7
 5 meter prati second (1,500 foot prati minute) ke 'sinc rate' (neeche aane kii gati) se kshatigrast hue bina pot par pahunch saktaa he
 Although they probably will not immediately test the aircraft at this sink rate, they must successfully prove that they are 5 in order to be eligible for vessel trials
 6 meter prati second ke sinc rate se land kar sakate hai
 5 test of the aircraft so far
 1 meter prati second ke sinc rate se kiya gaya he
 The engineers and pilots associated with the project are confident that they will achieve the target of landing certification
 yadi yah maan liya jaae ki LCA-N pareekshan main INS vikramaditya ke deck par utarane ke liye qualifi kar jaataa he, phir bhi do aisi ahm baadhaaen hai, jinase paar paanaa behad zaruri he
 The test pilots flying the aircraft must first experience the impact of the air being diverted from the aircraft carrier just before landing during the landing
 surakshit 'arested landing' ke liye LCA-N ko utarate vakt 240-260 kilometre (130-140 nots) kii lagbhag samaan gati banaae rakhni hogi, or dhyaan rakhana hoga ki pot ke deck par hawa ke alag-alag halaat kaa aasaani se asar ho jaataa he
 To experience these conditions, test pilots will sometimes 'touch and go' on the deck of INS Vikramaditya, in which they take off again without stopping completely as soon as they land
 vimanavahak pot par sampoorn 'arested landing' tabhi ho paaegi, jab test payalat landing ke liye neeche aate vakt vimaan kii sthirataa or land karte vakt ek samaan gati banaae rakhane ke prati aashwast ho jaaenge
 In addition, there is another major technical concern, which may affect the development program of LCA-N
 INS vikramaditya par vimaan ke land karte hi uski gati gata dene vaala maikenical system, yani arrester gear, us arrester gear se dizine ke lihaaz se kaaphi alag he, jo goa kii test facility main laga hua he
 Key members of the LCA-N project team are hoping that this difference will not affect the project, but they are confident that they will be able to actually land on the ship
 or ant main, sabase badi dikkat - jise tejas-en team ke ahm sadsy ne 'adhigrahan banaam vikaas bahes' kaa naam diya he
 Although the Navy is now fully supporting the LCA-N project, it is also keen to purchase 57 fully developed fighter aircraft from the US or France
 bhartiya nausena bowing egge / 18 i / epa 'hornet' tathaa daso dwaara nirmit rafel-em par nazar tikaae he, jo yuddh main istemaal kiye jane kii vajah se khud ko siddh kar chuke hai
 Now the important question is - will there be enough funds available for both tejas-n's development program and the purchase of such aircraft from the West? tejas-n team members told NDTV that they are often asked, " What do you need to recreate something that has already been created
 
 
 ?" is sawaal kaa jawaab sarkaar kii 'mek in india' ke prati katibaddhta ko sabit kar saktaa he, or desh kii sabase chunauteepurn ladaaku vimaan pariyojna kaa bhavishya ujjwal kar saktaa he

 In the Ayodhya Land Dispute Case case, the Supreme Court on Thursday heard the 27th day
 is dauraan muslim pakshakaar kii ore se rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki ramchabutara hi ram kaa janm sthaan tha na ki gumbad
 After the riots broke out between the Hindus and Muslims in 1855, the British built railings in the disputed structure
 is baat ke koi saboot nahin mili hai ki hindu gumbad ke neeche hi puja karte the
 With these arguments, Dhawan described Ram Sundar Tiwari's statement in the court as lax, saying that in 1995, Tiwari told about his first Ram Janmabhoomi visit in 1935 to visit Ramlala's picture and idol in the sanctum sanctorum
 Where was he, but in the cross-examination he could not tell from which door he entered? That is, his statement is not based on fact

 bal vivaah maamle main sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne kaha ki kanoon main bal vivaah ko aparaadh mana gaya he uske baavjood log bal vivaah karte hai

 At the same time, the third option is that nothing should be done in this and it should be considered an exception, which means that in the case of child marriage, if a husband with a girl of 15 to 18 years has a relationship then she will not be considered a rape
 yachikakarta kii taraf se kaha gaya ki bal vivaah se bacchon ke adhikaron kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he

 Perhaps you also feel how the market wants to claim its every emotional moment

 This is also a way of looking at an advertisement

 According to a recent study, humans also have a brain in their spinal cord, which protects us from falling or slipping
 study ke mutabik, yah dimag hamen bheed ke bich se guzarate vakt yaa sardiyon main barfili sataha se guzarate vakt santulan banane main madad karti he or phisalane yaa girane se bachaati he

 They have detected that these sensor fibers are present in the spinal cord along with other groups of nerves called RORI neurons

 gulabi nagar ke diggi pales main chal rahe paanch divasiy jaipur litarechar festival ke tisare din ke satr ‘clearing e spes bitwin fect and fiction’ main choudhary ne kaha, ‘jaise hi cinema shwet-shyaam se rangeen hua, usne kuch khoyaa hi he
 The producers need to think on how to make the film interesting and present the colors used in an attractive way so that the audience is attracted to it
 mashhoor sho ‘charlie chaplin’ kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki yah sho shwet-shyaam or khamosh hone ke baavjood bahut zyada pansadeeda rahaa
 Awarded with several awards, Chaudhary gave an example of comparison of two different arts and said that colors are used differently to bring alive the classical Indian dance and western theater sets
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 15 may ko pashchim bengal ke bashirhaat main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue bangla main ek naaraa diya ''unishei saaf (2019 main hi saaf)
 "narendra Modi's slogan was in response to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's slogan," Du-thousand Unis / BJP Finish "(BJP will end in 2019)
 narendra modi ke naare par vahaan maujuud bheed ne puure damdaar tareeke se jaighosh karte hue pratikriya di thi
 Inspired by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, West Bengal's 10 crore population was looking for a leader who could compete with Mamata Banerjee in the same manner
 aise logon kaa maananaa he ki ve narendra modi hi hai jo pashchim bengal ko didi (mamata banerjee) ke us trinmul tolabaji tex se nijaat dilaa sakate hai, jiske tahat logon ko college main pravesh paane ke liye, yaa anya kaamon ke alaava sarkari skulon main shikshak ke rup main behaal hone ke liye tiemasi ko paise dene padate hai
 Narendra Modi's image as a strong rival to Mamata Banerjee was constantly getting stronger
 unhone maujuud bheed se kaha, ''jitna adhik aap 'modi modi' ke naare lagaate hai, utani hi unki ankhon se neend gaayab ho jaati he
 She angrily abuses me
 maine bengal ke logon ke pyaar kii takat se didi ke krodh kaa saamana karne kii shakti paidaa kar lee he
 Sensing this mood of anti-incumbency, BJP national president Amit Shah had made his plans for the Bengal victory campaign a year and a half ago
 unki yojana main sanghathan ko andruni rup se majboot karnaa shaamil tha
 Along with this, his plan included bringing leaders like TMC number two Mukul Roy into the party and preparing the ground for revival of Hindutva amidst the atmosphere of Mamata Banerjee's alleged minority appeasement
 amit shah ne pashchim bengal main bada laabh hasil karne ke liye ve saare sahi kadam uthaae jo unhen uthaane chahie the
 These steps were also seen to be successful
 amit shah ne rajya kii 42 loksabhaa siton main se 23 siton ko jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa or saal 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main spasht jeet hasil karne kaa khaakaa khinchaa
 Even before the elections in the state, skeptics had termed Amit Shah's goal as impractical
 ve maanate the ki bengal hindipattee kii tarah jati or samudaay kii raajnneeti se alag chalata he or yahaan dharmanirpeksh vam vichaardhaara kaa hi prabhaav rahata he
 But the BJP had realized that West Bengal is ready for change
 kolkata ke presidency college main shikshak or samaaj vigyaani prashanth re kehete hai, ''satta virdohi lehren itani oonchi uth rahi thim ki yahaan tak ki bengal main chatushkoniya rajnatik bisaat ke baavjood tiemasi or bhaajapa ke bich aamane-saamne kii ladaai kii jameen taiyaar ho gai thi
 Wherever the Left and Congress were not becoming a challenge for TMC
 unhone apana vot share bhaajapa ko hastantarit kar diya
 That is why the vote share of the Left has declined by 22 percent, which is evident from the proportionate increase in the same proportion of the BJP
 ''presidency vishvavidhyalay ke raajnneeti vigyaan vibhaag ke purv adhyaksh anik chatarji kehete hai, ''ek nae netritv ke abhaav main saal 2011 ke baad se vamapanthiyon kaa graph lagaataar girtaa ja rahaa tha or is baat ko lekar bhi unamem bhram tha ki vamapanthiyon kaa asal dushman koun he—trinmul yaa bhaajapa? or unka mitra koun he congress yaa bhaajapa?''mamata banerjee bhaajapa ke alaava kisi anya party ko nahin kos rahi thim or is tarah rajnatik dhruvikaran ke liye is baar kaaphi had tak vahi jimmedaar hai
 What was the result? The vote share of the saffron party increased significantly — from 17 percent in 2014 to 40 percent of bjp's vote share in 2019
 is dhruvikaran kii vajah se tiemasi ko ek aisi party ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha jo alpsankhyak samudaay ko lekar bahut naram thi jabaki bhaajapa ne khud ko bahusankhyak hinduon kii party ke rup main pesh kiya
 Mamta Banerjee's attempt to appear secular by reciting Hindu verses and Islamic principles from the same platform did not work
 vahiin, musalamaanon ne tiemasi ke liye ekamusth vot nahin kiya, lekin bangladesh kii seemaa se lage kshetron ke bengal ke hindu ekajute rahe
 BJP state vice-president Jai Prakash Majumdar says, "this time we also got at least five to six percent Muslim votes
 ''jadhavpur vishvavidhyalay ke purv professor mohit re kehete hai, ''narendra modi kii hindu sharnaarthiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta dene or naagarikta adhikaron ke liye rashtriya register ko taiyaar karne ke bharose ne bhaajapa ko 10-12 siton par badhat dilaai
 "state BJP president Dilip Ghosh feels that the need to be vigilant about his rights has become necessary
 ve kehete hai, ''mukhyamantri ne rathyatra yaa sankalp yatra kii anumati nahin di or reliyon main aane vaale hamaare netaaon ke helicopter bengal main na utren, iske liye unhone gandi raajnneeti kii
 However, says election analyst Yogendra Yadav, "if the TMC represents a return to the chaos of the late 1960s, the rise of the BJP signals a return to the 1940s communal massacre
" ''is baat kii charchaa pehle se hi he ki apni jeet ko lekar aashwast nahin dikh rahe tiemasi ke saansad or asantusht vidhayak, bhaajapa ke sampark main hai
 Mukul Roy, who joined BJP from TMC, claims, "soon things will reach such a point that Mamta will not be able to run the government
" ’’is bich, mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne apane aap ko kalighat sthit apane ghar ke ek kamare main band kar liya tha
 She was playing synthesizer and writing poetry to restrain herself
 ab unhone diwaar par likhi ibaarat ko sweekaar kar liya he, lekin ve palatwaar karengi
 Mamta Banerjee tweeted, "congratulations to the winners
 lekin jo haar gaye hai ve haare nahin hai
 We will have to do a comprehensive review of it
 "chhat" Bengali Hindu voters were soft-spoken with bjp's hardline Hindutva

 The charges of corruption of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Bofors were again raised today by PM Narendra Modi
 unhone congress ko chunauti di he ki dam he to baaki bache do charnon main isi mudde par chunaav lard kar dekh le
 PM Modi said that voting has to be done in Punjab, Delhi, Bhopal
 congress chaahe to rajeev gandhi ke naam par chunaav lard kar dikhaa de
 And Rahul Gandhi has responded to the PM at a rally in Delhi shortly before now
 aapako bataa duun ki rajeev gandhi ko bhrashtachari number ek bataane ke piem modi ke bayaan se congress pehle se hi bhadki hui he
 The party today made a complaint to the Election Commission as well
 congress kaa kahana he ki yah apmanjanak bhashaa he
 Congress is not alone in this protest
 uske kuch sambhavit sahyogi dal bhi ise lekar behad aakraamak hai
 This attack has also put those parties which are still keeping distance from Congress like Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress
 piem modi ne purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke bare main aisa kya kaha tha jise lekar vivaad shuru hua
 Rahul Gandhi had earlier responded to this through a tweet
 unhone kaha tha ki modiji, ladaai khatm ho chuki he
 Your actions are waiting for you
 khud ke bare main apni aantarik soch ko mere pita par thopanaa bhi aapako nahin bachaa paaegaa
 Rahul with saprem and jhappi
 ' iske baad hi samaajawaadee party ke akhilesh yadav or trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee ne bhi twitor par piem modi ko aade haathon liya tha
 Akhilesh Yadav said that political differences are in place, but martyrs and their families should be sympathetic
 vahiin mamata banerjee ne kaha rajeev gandhi ke bare main is tarah kii tippanee behad durbhagyapurna he, lekin piem modi ne aaj ek baar phir is mudde ko uthaakar congress ko chunauti di he, isse saaf he ki ve is par peeche hatane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 This janitor is considered to be the answer to Rahul Gandhi's slogan
 rahul gandhi francisi ladaaku vimaan rafel main anil ambani kii company ko ofaset theke milane main bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaate hai, jabaki boforce kaa maamla rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar ke vakt sweden se kharidi gai boforce topon se judaa he jisamen sweden ke radio ne khulaasa kiya tha ki is saude main bharat ke sheersh netaaon or kuch adhikariyon or bichauliyon ko ghoose di gai
 After this, the then Defense Minister VP Singh resigned from the Rajiv government and made the Bofors bribery case a big issue
 ve bijepi or left partiyon ke sahyog se sarkaar main aae
 In his government, the CBI registered an FIR in this case, in which the names of Bofors president Martin Ardbo, middleman Vin Chadha and Hinduja brothers
 10 saal baad atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke vakt chargeshit daayar hui, jisamen sibiai ne rajeev gandhi ko aaropee banaaya
 Just before the 2004 elections, the Delhi High Court dismissed the bribery allegations against Rajiv Gandhi and said that the CBI could not gather any evidence against him
 kuch maheene baad sarkaar badal gai or congress kii aguwai main upie sarkaar bani
 The CBI did not challenge the Delhi High Court's decision in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar banane ke baad sibiai ne 2018 main yachika daayar kii, lekin ise deree kii vajah se khaarij kar diya gaya
 So now the question is whether the issue of Bofors has been raised in place of Rafael? Is the chowkidar chor hai the answer to the Congress slogan, Corruption No
 1? bharat samet duniya bhar main dedh maheene ke andar duusare bade sibar hamale ne chintaa badha di he
 This time also, the cyber attacker has not been detected so far
 philhal is baat ke aankade jutaaye ja rahe hai ki sibar hamalaavaron ne kitni bevesite or computaron ko nishaanaa banaaya
 The attack, which started in Russia and Ukraine, has engulfed the world
 sibar hamalavar ne phiroti bhi maangi he
 According to cyber security agencies, the ransomware virus named Petrapp took over the websites of the world's top 20 companies
 is sibar hamale ke baad se yah sawaal bhi uth rahe hai ki aakhir koun desh insibar hamalonko anjaam nahin de rahe hai
 There is also a possibility of terrorists being behind this
 haal hi ke dinon main dekhne ko mila he ki sibar hekking ke chalate kai deshon ke aapasi rishte kharaab hue hai
 a case of interference in the US presidential election through hacking came to light, which Russia was accused of
 iske chalate america or rus ke rishte bighad gaye the
 Also read: Big cyber attack again worldwide, website of 20 companies including Mumbai's JNPT is interesting thing that cyber attacker is not even identified in it
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki sibar hamalavar kii pahchaan nahin hone se ek desh duusare ko mahaj ashanka ke aadhaar par nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 In such a situation, bitterness between rival countries can increase rapidly
 kai visheshgy yah bhi kehete hai ki aglaa vishwayuddh online ladaa jayega, jo parmaanu yuddh se bhi zyada ghaatak ho saktaa he
 Nuclear weapons of the world's powerful countries, including the US, will also be derailed and hackers will destroy the world in seconds
 vartmaan main katar sankat or khadi kshetra main upje tanaav ke liye hekking ko hi jimmedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, cyber security is a challenge for the world
 america jaisaa shaktishaalee desh bhi nahin kar paaya javaabi hamalarashtrapati chunaav ke baad america khufia agenciyon ne maamle kii jaanch kii, to paaya ki rus ne america chunaav main dakhal dekar trump ko jitayaa tha
 After this, the US fired Russian diplomats, but by then it was too late
 america jaisaa duniya kaa sabase shaktishaalee desh bhi is sibar hamale se na to khud ko nahin bachaa paaya or na hi javaabi karrwai kar paaya
 On May 12, computers from dozens of UK hospitals were hacked by hackers via ransomware
 is sabase bade sibar hamale kii chapet main 99 desh aae the, lekin aaj tak hamalavar kaa koi atapata nahin chalaa
 Cyber attacks have also threatened the existence of democracy
 bharat bhi chapet mencybar hamale kii chapet main bharatbhi he
 In recent times, hacking of websites of Indian government sites and institutions like iits has come to light
 vipaksh bhi is masale ko jorshor se uthaa chukaa he
 In such a situation, India should move strongly towards cyber security
 agar samay rahete is ore dhyaan nahin diya gaya, to modi sarkari kii digital india yojana khatre main pad jaaegi

 pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ko badi kamyaabi mili he
 The 19th SAARC Conference to be held in Islamabad has been canceled
 'aaj tak' ko kathmandu main sutron se mili exclusive jaankaree ke mutabik saarc sammelan radd karne kaa faisla liya gaya he
 a formal announcement about this is expected in a short while
 bharat ke saath hi padosi bangladesh, bhutan or afghanistan ne is sammelan kaa bahishkaar karne kaa faisla kiya he
 After the opposition of member countries on the issue of terrorism, the current Chairman of SAARC is trying to save the organization of Nepal
 nepal november main hone vaale isasmmelanke liye venue islamabad se badalakar duusari jagah karne par vichaar kar rahaa he
 After the Uri terror attack, the Modi government has taken a big decision on the diplomacy front to isolate Nepal
 bharat ke is faisle ke samarthan main teen or padosi deshon ke aa jane ke baad dakshin asia ke 8 deshon vaale is gut main ab pakistan ke saath nepal, srilanka or maldive hi bache hai
 However, terming India's decision as unfortunate, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry accused India of promoting terrorism in Pakistan
 'radio pakistan' ne pakistani videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa nafis jakaaria ke hawaale se khabar di he ki bharat sahit 4 deshon ke bahishkaar ke baavjood pakistan saarc sammelan yojit karegaa
 However, this is not possible
 jaaniye, bharat ke bycott kaa kya hoga asar?1985 main bane is gut main bharat sabase bada sadsy he
 If India and three other members do not attend this conference, then its event has also been clouded
 nae niyamon ke mutabik sammelan main sabhi sadsy deshon kii maujuudagi jaruri he, nahin to aayojan sthagit karnaa padegaa yaa radd karnaa padegaa
 This will be the first time since 1985 that India has decided to boycott the SAARC summit
 is sammelan main bharat ke nahin jane se aayojan kii sari taiyaariyaan dhari kii dhari rah jaaengi
 Sri Lanka has said that the SAARC Conference is not possible without India's participation
 bharat ke is kadam kaa chaar anya sadsy deshon kaa saath dene kaa matlab he ki bharat dakshin asia main apni majboot kootnithik pakad bana rahaa he
 Afghanistan and Bangladesh are also battling terrorism themselves, but small countries like Bhutan and Sri Lanka stand with India shows India's strength
 jidipi ke hisaab se saarc kii iconomi duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha he
 SAARC member countries are spread over three per cent of the world and about 21 per cent of the entire population of the world lives in these countries
 in aath deshon main bharat kaa kshetrafal or aabaadi 70 fisadi se bhi zyada he
 saarc's average GDP growth rate 8 during 2005–10
 8 fisadi prativarsh thi lekin 2011 main yah ghatakar 6
 It was reduced to 5 percent
 yah bharat main aarthik mandi kaa asar tha kyonki saarc kii kul iconomi kaa kareeb 80 fisadi bharat ke hisse main he
 The cancellation of the SAARC conference would cause diplomatic embarrassment to Pakistan in public
 pakistan ko ye sandesh gaya he ki aatank ko paalane-posane se wo alag-thalag pad chukaa he
 Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh have given weight to India's arguments against Pakistan
 aatankwaad ke mudde par pakistan ko alag thalag karne se antarrashtriya samudaay main bhi sandesh jayega
 Because in SAARC itself there are 7 big countries including America and a big organization as Observer
 aane vaale dinon main pakistan ko kootnithik str par or zyada alag thalag pad jane kaa dar hoga

 BJP has suffered a major setback in the election results of five states of the country
 jabaki congress ko chunavi nateezon se sanjivani mil gai he
 Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh have come out of the hands of the BJP and transformed into a Congress ruled state
 nateezon se saaf he ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ko satta main vaapasi ke liye kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Five states will hold the key to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 inamen uttar pradesh, maharashtra, pashchim bengal, bihar or tamilnadu shaamil hai
 These are the five states in the country that have the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats
 in rajyon main kul 249 sansadeey siten he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP alliance led by Narendra Modi got 148 seats
 jabaki congress ko mahaj 10 siten or anya ke khate main 91 siten ai thim
 These five states will once again be eyeing the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki in rajyon kii siyaasi tasviir badal sakati he
 While challenges are being created for the BJP, there seems to be possibilities for the Congress
 uttar pradeshnarendra modi kaa sara daaromadar uttar pradesh par tikaa hua he
 In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP had managed to win 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP
 iske alaava 2 siten bijepi kii sahyogi apana dal ko mili thi
 In this way, NDA got 73 seats
 jabaki congress ko 2 or sapa ko paanch siten mili thi
 Apart from this, in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP also won a historic victory and seated power
 ab mana ja rahaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa or congress milakar chunavi maidan main utar sakate hai
 The bjp's equation may be disturbed by their arrival
 pichley dinon soobe kii teen loksabhaa siton par upachunaav hue hai or bijepi ne in teenon siton ko ganvaaya he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for BJP to repeat the results in 2014 in 2019
 jabaki sapa-basapa or congress gathbandhan kii acchhee khaasi siten badhane kii ummiden najar aa rahi hai
 Maharashtra will play an important role in Narendra Modi's return in 2019
 maharashtra main kul 48 loksabhaa siten hai
 In the 2014 elections, BJP got 23 seats and its ally Shiv Sena 18 seats
 jabaki congress 2 or ensipi 4 siton par simat gai thi
 At the same time, one seat went to the Swabhiman Paksha
 bataa den ki shivasena or bijepi ke rishte bhi manmutav bhare dikh rahe hai
 Both parties have indicated to contest separately in 2019
 jabaki congress or ensipi ek saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections are not easy for the BJP
 jabaki vipaksh ko badhane kii ummid najar aa rahi
 Bihar will also play a very important role in Bihar 2019
 bihar main kul 40 vidhansabha siten hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 22 seats and its allies LJP 6 and RLSP 3 seats
 haalanki, ab araspi endie se alag ho gai
 At the same time, JDU has once again become a part of NDA
 bijepi pichley chunaav kii tulana main 17 siton par chunaav ladegi
 In such a situation, his seats have decreased even before the elections
 vahiin, congress or argedy ek saath he
 The graph of RJD has increased under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav
 aise vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne congress ko sanjivani de di he
 In such a situation, the congress-rjd alliance looks hopeful
 pashchim bengalapaschim bengal main kul 42 siten hai
 In the 2014 elections, the BJP got just 2 seats
 jabaki tiemasi ke khate main 34 siten ai thi
 The bjp's graph has increased in the state and has become the number two party
 bijepi ne 22 siton kaa target rakhaa he, lekin tiemasi vipakshi dalon ke saath milakar chunaav maidan main utarane kii baat kar rahi he
 In such a situation, if the opposition is united then it will be a big challenge for the BJP to fulfill its target
 tamilnadu2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tamilnadu bhi ek ahm rajya he
 There are total 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main AIADMK ko 37 siten mili thi
 Whereas BJP got one seat
 AIADMK kai maukey par bijepi ke saath khadi najar ai he
 Whereas, it is with Congress and DMK

 But surprisingly, the welcome of those who came home from the 'gulf' with gifts no longer reflected the happiness of the relatives in the airport
 vastav main, yah kai logon ke liye khushi kaa avasar to katai nahin he
 Many people coming out of the airport through the exit gate are probably coming out of the airport for the last time

 Even taxi drivers are no longer following those passengers because they know that many of these people may not be in a position to pay the taxi fare
