 But where he has been missing for the last few days, what happened to his show 'family Time with Kapil Sharma' is not known to anyone
 darasal, family time band hone par kaha gaya ki content se naakhush kapil ek maheene ke brake ke baad nae kalevar se sho lekar aaenge
 It has been a long time frame of one month, but neither Kapil's team nor the channel has any future plan regarding 'family Time with Kapil Sharma'
 kya pichhali baar kii tarah hi khatm hua kapil kaa sho?mana ja rahaa he ki family time bhi kapil ke puraane sho kii tarah khatm ho chukaa he
 However, his relationship with Sony TV is still better
 family time band hone kaa sanket soni tivi ke bijness head danish khan haalia intervyuu main bhi mila
 In fact, in response to an Indian Express question, Danish did not say anything on the return of Family Time, but in the future, said that the channel will work with Kapil again
 danish ne kaha- "kapil jab bhi swasth honge, ham unke saath phir se kaam karenge
 We would be very happy to work with them
 "
 
 
 Due to their absence, the new show of Kapil Sharma flopped! The Kapil Sharma Show was also done in such a way that it was alleged that during 'family Time', Kapil was accused of canceling the shoot continuously like the old show
 haalanki kapil ke nazdikiyon ne in baton ko sire se khaarij kiya
 His poor health was later cited
 isse pehle 'da kapil sharma sho' ke dauraan bhi yahi sab hua tha
 It was said that Kapil used to make celebs wait for hours on the set and return them without shooting
 unki beemaari kii baaten bhi saamne ai
 After this, the channel stopped Kapil's show in the name of giving break
 kapil sharma kaa jarnlist ko kanoonee notice, 7 din main maafee mangodipressant se jujh rahe hai kapilkhabaron kii maane to kapil depressant se jujh rahe hai or iskaa ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 Also, according to reports, he also went on a holiday with his girlfriend Ginni Chatrath when he got a break from work
 kapil ke depressant kii khabaren pichley ek saal se aa rahi hai
 He was also addicted to alcohol
 unki beemaari or nashe kii lat ko hi downfaal kaa kaaran bataaya jaataa he
 Kapil Sharma said - People will keep watching, will return with shock, abuses to the editor: In April, Kapil phoned the editor of an entertainment portal and abused him
 editor ne phone kii recording ko public kar diya tha, jiske baad kapil ke phens hairaan rah gaye the
 Not only this, Kapil had lodged an FIR against the editor, Preity Simos and his sister Neeti Simos
 kapil ne in logon par 25 lakh rupee vasuulne or badnaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 March last year is behind Kapil
 Brawlers have been in dispute for the last one year
 pichley saal march main kapil ne flite main sunil grover sang ladaai kii thi
 After this Sunil left 'the Kapil Sharma Show'
 sunil ke saath ali asagar, chandan prabhakar ne bhi sho ko alavida kah diya tha
 Although Kapil continued his show even after this, but then he started canceling shooting with celebs
 kai celebs unke set par ghanton intjaar karte rah jate the, lekin kapil shooting ke liye aate hi nahin the
 They used to constantly shoot
 Shoot: At that time there were reports of Kapil being in depression
 haalanki sirf beemaari hi nahin in sabake peeche ek or kaaran tha
 Actually, Kapil was busy shooting his second Bollywood film 'firangi' in those days
 khabaren aati thim ki kapil apane sho kii shooting cancil kar film kii shooting karte the
 Some reports even said that Kapil used to drink so much alcohol that he could not get up on time for the shoot
 in sab baton ko sun log kehane lage the ki kapil staradam sambhaal nahin paa rahe
 Seeing the escalating controversy, the channel had decided to discontinue the show
 channel chahta tha ki kapil swasth hokar lauten
 It will be interesting to see how Kapil will come out of all things and return to TV

 The government implemented the new rule of daily changes in the prices of petrol and diesel from 6 am on Friday
 ab petrol or dijal ke daam raat 12 baje nahin, balki subah 6 baje badalenge
 Petrol pump owners are very happy with the new rule
 unka maananaa he ki sarkaar kaa yah faisalaa bahut acha he
 This will benefit the petrol pump owners as well as the common people
 haalanki is bare main behad kam logon ko jaankaree he ki inke badale hue rojaanaa ke daamon se kaise apadet rahaa jaae? dilli main mayur vihaar petrol pump par jab logon se nae niyam ke bare main poocha gaya, to unka kahana tha ki hamen is baat kii jaankaree nahin he
 When asked how they would keep up with the changes in the prices of petrol and diesel every day, they did not give a satisfactory answer
 unhone kaha ki unako khud nahin pataa ki ve isse kaise apadet rahenge
 In such a situation, questions are now arising that if this situation is there in the national capital Delhi, what will happen in remote villages? People in Delhi are not aware that from today the prices of petrol and diesel will change daily
 haalanki yah nayaa niyam desh ke 58 hazaar petrol panpon par lagu ho gaya he
 Also read: Reduction in petrol and diesel prices, will be decided from today onwards, only about 6-7 thousand petrol pumps are in such an automatic update system, that as soon as new prices are applicable, the inpatrol pump will be updated automatically
 
 magar un petrol panpon kaa kya hoga, jahaan mashin main khud daam badalane padate hai
 In such a situation, it is feared that petrol and diesel will be sold expensive on the basis of increased prices, despite lower prices
 kaise pataa karen aaj kaa bhav?aam janata ke saamne sabase badi samasya yah he ki rojanaapetrol or dijal kii badalihui keemton kaa pataa kaise lagaaya jaae
 To know this, you can either look on the web site of Indian All or you can find out through a message
 iske liye aapako SMS RSP DEALER CODE tip karnaa hoga or 92248 par bhejnaa hoga
 After this message you will get the answer that what is the cost of petrol diesel today? ranjan kii pichley saal 13 may ko goli markar hatya kar di gai thi or unki patni ne is hatya main shahabuddin kii bhoomika hone kaa aarope lagaaya he

 Modi government was sworn in
 unhone 2014 main shikshak diwas ke maukey par ek chaatr ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha ki 2024 tak to vahi pradhanmantri rahenge
 There are very few people who fulfill such political claims about power
 pradhanmantri narend modi kaa doosraa kaarykaal aupchaarik rup se shuru ho gaya
 Today was an event oriented day in the country of agriculture
 ye to kahie ki mantriyon ko phone aane lage varanaa ankaron ke halak sookhne lage the ki kinakaa naam chalaaen or kinakaa naam nahin
 But everyone was focused on when the biggest news of this cabinet would be announced
 atakalein chal rahi thim magar koi nahin chalaa paa rahaa tha amit shah ke shaamil hone kii ghoshnaa kab hogi
 Then a tweet comes from Gujarat around quarter to five
 gujarat bijepi ke adhyaksh jitu baghani twit karte hai ki pradhanmantri shri narend modi ji ke netritv main kendiy mantrimandal main majboot saathi ke rup main shaamil hone par hamarepathdarshak maardarshak shraddhey shri amit shah ji se shubhechha mulaakaat kii or shubhakamanaayen deen
 The bus news broke
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah modi sarkaar kaa hissaa banenge
 Those who witnessed the competition between Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah could not see the journey that started with both
 kai baar ham jin netaaon ko din raat tivi par dekhte hai, lagane lagata he ki ham sab kuch unke bare main jaanate hai
 But once again, one needs to know about Amit Shah
 pradhanmantri se 14 saal chote hai
 She is 54 years old at the moment
 amit shah or pradhanmantri ke rishte ko samajhnaa he to kuch tasviren dikhaanaa chahta hum
 Politics is this visual order of relationships
 aap jab bhi amit shah ko pradhanmantri kaa swaagat karte dekhen ek kism kii aupchaarikta dikhegi or wo har baar dikhegi
 The Prime Minister gets out of the car and Amit Shah silently dresses the organ like a normal worker and gives a bouquet
 aap kabhi bhi isamen herpher nahin dekhenge
 Whenever you see the same formality will be seen
 amit shah or narendra modi 1987 se ek duusare ko jaanate hai
 There will be so much informality in their relationship, but by looking at such a picture in front of the camera outside, you can understand who is the boss in both
 netaa koun he
 i have shown this picture to you because in the last five years i have always noticed that Amit Shah welcomes Narendra Modi in a formal way
 yah vijual kuch hi second kaa hota he or hameshaa is swaagat ke baad kii badi ghatnaon ke kawarej main gaayab ho jaataa he lekin maine hameshaa dekha he ki duniya kii nazar main baraabar dekhe jane vaale in do main netaa koun he
 This is also a special thing about this meeting
 pradhanmantri bhi aise milte hai jaise amit shah ko nahin jaanate hon
 Amit Shah also welcomes as if afraid of the Prime Minister
 raajnneeti or media ke chaatr ise alag se note karen ki public life main kis had tak aupchaarik or anushaasit hona padataa he
 That's why initially i called it visual order i
e
 visual arrangement
 donon ek duusare ke liye jo bhi hai magar camere ke saamne ve hameshaa isi tarah se dikhenge
 The special thing about Amit Shah and Narendra Modi is that both do not cross each other's path
 aapako kya yaad he ki amit shah america gaye hon, landan gaye hon or vahaan bhaashan de rahe hon
 Can you tell a single incident in the last 5 years? amit shah ko pataa he ki unki had kya he
 Those who know them say that they do not cultivate mogulas
 unhen yaad rahata he ki ve amit shah hai
 Narendra Modi is their leader
 1987 se amit shah or narendra modi ek duusare ko jaanate hai
 The memories of both the Chandervilas restaurants on Gandhi Road in Ahmedabad will still be remembered today
 120 saal purana he chandravilas restraan
 This restaurant portrays the arrival of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel
 rajkupar bhi
 Due to the fire, it is not like the old, but this restaurant has a small place in their life
 yahaan kii chaay or jalebi ke bich amit shah ne ek din narendra modi se kaha tha ki aap bhartiya janata party ke bhavishya hai
 One day you will become the Prime Minister of India
 us vakt narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri bhi nahin bane the
 i got this information from the conversation from Sheila Bhatt's article
 ye donon tabhi se gujarat ke baahar kii duniya ko samajhane lage the
 Both did not cut their leader's path until Advani failed in 2009
 unke naakaam hone ke baad se hi modi shah kii jodi bhaajapa kii raajnneeti main ubharne lagati he
 Sushil Modi will remember
 rajkot main jaiprakash narayan kii sabha main susheel modi aae the
 Amit Shah caught a bus from Ahmedabad and went to Rajkot to see JP
 smritiyon kii bhi apni seemaa hoti he
 a lot will be read about Amit Shah on the Internet
 indian express main 25 janvari 2016 ke din chapa shila bhatta kaa lekh aap pard sakate hai
 Sheila Bhatt wrote in that article that Amit Shah was made the president of BJP because he does not hesitate about Hindutva and nationalism
 peeche nahin hatate hai
 You can also match this with political events after 2016
 amit shah ek samrudh parivaar se aate hai
 His ancestral home in Mansa is considered heritage
 1980 main raajnneeti main aane se pehle unka pivisi pipe kaa bijness tha, jise raajnneeti main aane ke baad chhod diya
 Amit Shah's grandfather was associated with the stock market
 san 2000 main ahmedabad district koparative bank limited kaa adhyaksh bane or use safaltaapurvak chalaaya
 Perhaps because of these business experiences, his claim on the finance ministry has started
 amit shah khud ko chipku kehete hai wo isliye ki apane lakshya se chipak jate hai
 Sheila Bhatta has written that Amit Shah believes that if the Congress had not sent him to jail in 2010, he would not have come to the center of politics
 jail main unhone congress ko haraane kaa pran liya
 And chose UP to fulfill this promise
 2014 main jab sab bijepi ko upi main 40 seat tak de rahe the amit shah 73 le aae
 Amit Shah was Advani's election agent in Gandhinagar
 jis seat par adwani ko ladaate rahe, usee seat se is baar saansad banakar raashtrapati bhawan ke shapath grahan samaaroh main pahunch gaye
 How much has been written in connection with Sohrabuddin Tulsiram Prajapati case and Judge Loya case
 is cese main amit shah bari kar die gaye hai
 This decision of the CBI Special Court may not be challenged further, but this case has a big role in Amit Shah's political life
 shila bhatta vaale lekh main unhone kaha he ki jab bhi unke bare main likhaa jayega is cese ke bare main likhaa jayega
 The Sohrabuddin Tulsiram Prajapati case is part of his image, which he does not care for
 ve apana kaam karte rahete hai
 2007 was the year
 main nayaa nayaa reporter tha
 Gujarat assembly election results were coming
 meri tainaati amit shah ke ghar par hui thi
 i have not met Amit Shah since 2014
 is baar jab 2019 main nattejey aa rahe the jab bijepi ne channelon main bhejne ke liye 48 pravaktaaon ke jo roster banaae the usamen ek bhi pravaktaa kaa naam mere kaarykram ke liye nahin tha magar main 2007 ke saal main amit shah ke ghar main tha
 Right inside usee laal mike ke saath
 i was inside Amit Shah's house when Amit Shah is going to the counting center with his mother's blessing, touching his feet
 main aapako dikhaanaa chahta hum
 Before the result, Amit Shah had said that BJP would get two-third seats and the result was the same
 na main badla na amit shah
 With this answer of Amit Shah you can understand his style of politics
 shaayad praayshchit kii koi jagah nahin
 But i saw Amit Shah addressing 100-50 workers in the Delhi Assembly elections
 mujhe laga tha ki rashtriya adhyaksh itani kam bheed dekhakar laut jaaenge magar amit shah ne dakshin dilli ke ilaake kaa apana kaarykram puraa kiya tha
 Amit Shah is the President of Somnath Temple Trust
 gujarat cricket association ke bhi adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 The journey of a politician is interesting
 vah kab kitaab ban jaae or kab kitaab kaa footnots koi nahin jaanata
 The leader who stays in the footnotes also becomes the book
 amit shah ne bijepi ko bhi badal diya he
 a new BJP office was formed in dozens of districts
 amit shah ne inaki yojana banaai or apana kaarykaal khatm hone se pehle desh ke kai zilon main bijepi kaa nayaa daftar ban kar taiyaar ho gaya
 We have heard about the leaders of the other party that they ran into another party with the money of the party, but under the direction of Amit Shah, many new offices of BJP were formed
 dilli kaa mukhyalay bhavy to he hi
 a new political system should have been foreseen from these offices as well
 amit shah ne kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki apane pradarshnon, gatividhiyon kaa puraa record rakhen
 So that people of the coming generations can see it
 research kar saken kyonki zubaani itihaas par koi yakeen nahin rakhata
 It was a surprise to read this line in Sheila Bhatt's article
 itihaas ke mul vishyon ko zubaani taur par badal dene vaale amit shah apni party ke itihaas main tathyon or sorce ko kitni gambhirtha se lete hai
 The oath taking ceremony has its own charm
 aam logon ke jivan se jude mantralayon ko ham media vaale kitna mahatv dete hai
 There is a drought all over the country, but who gets the water resources ministry, it is short sighted, who got the home ministry, everyone lives in its circle
 satta hamaari soch par haaavee hoti he
 Swearing is an example of how power reaches that thinking
 hazaron mehmaanon se bhare raashtrapati bhawan kaa yah praangan kisi tivi siriyal ke set kii tarah bhavy lag rahaa tha
 In the era of liberalization, the India which we started watching through TV serials, today looks like a grand set in the premises of Rashtrapati Bhavan
 yahaan aane vaali hastiyaan shapath grahan samaaroh ko kisse kahaniyon main badal rahi thim
 Through many channels, people sitting in far flung areas will be seeing these celebrities, then they are dreaming of reaching there
 satta kii bhavyata aam gharon main isi tarah devatv liye pravesh karti he
 a dream is made
 koi raju pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekh rahaa hoga
 Some Sunita must be dreaming of becoming Prime Minister
 raajnneeti or media ke is modi system daur main aap vizual order ko nahin samajhenge to modi daur ko samaj hi nahin sakate
 Everything is grand on camera
 is bhavyata ke do chor hai
 At one end there is Prime Minister Modi and at the other end all those special people who are considering themselves as special today, but the camera is showing them like ordinary people
 sabakuch kitna kareeb kaa lag rahaa he magar tab bhi duuri kaa hisaab thik se lagaaya gaya he
 India is registering its destiny
 usne dekha to bahut kuch he magar aisa bahut dinon baad dekha he
 Seeing a lot for the first time
 loktantr kaa parv khatm ho gaya he
 Now another festival is starting
 dilli kii tapati dopahari se garm hui hawa jane kya jaadu lekar shaam ko bahane lagi hogi jab khule aasmaan ke neeche baithe ye aam log, tej garmi kii shikaayat kiye bagair apane aap ko khushkismat samajhate rahe
 Visual order of Modi system
 taqatvar gadiyon se aati satta
 Used to come every time, but now the style of arrival of these trains has changed
 satta ke dikhne kaa tarika badal gaya he
 Change the way you see India
 yah nayaa bharat he
 New looking
 aam se lekar khaas log pradhanmantri ke swaagat main khadey ho gaye hai
 The camera has recorded everyone
 shapath grahan paanch saal main ek baar aata he
 Swearing in ceremony begins now
 jisaki baat brake ke baad karenge

 vikaas or pradooshan saath-saath chalate hai
 The problem is when we forget the problems associated with it in the glare of progress
 jis tarah se 'vikaas' ek nai avadharana he, thik usee tarah paryaavaran sangrakshan bhi nae jamaane kii ek samasya he
 Development is the catalyst for progress, but its core is not merely economic element, but qualitative progress

 Was similar development conceptualized in public sentiments? The way 'development' - post-globalization, is a new concept stemming from the dominance of capital, beyond the sense of human coexistence; Similarly, environmental protection is also a challenge of the new age

 sanad rahe ki vikaas ek saapekshik avadharana he or samajerthi prathit hone ke baavjood iske myne ‘pragati’ se bhinn hai
 Development is the catalyst for progress, but its core is not merely economic element, but qualitative progress
 sabhi ke jivan main sakaaratmak badlaav
 The irony is that the growing craving for material happiness and the concept of perceived development created a terrible problem and is then spending all its energy, accumulation power and money in the name of its solution

 325 Publisher: Conceptual Publication spain ke tometina festival ke bare main to aap jaanate hi honge
 Tomatina Festival is famous all over the world, in this festival people throw tomatoes at each other
 lekin bharat main to aap tometina festival kii kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate kyonki yahaan to mausam badalte hi tamaato kaa bhav badalane lagata he
 There is a tremendous boom in the price of tomatoes about 2 times a year
 ek barsaat ke samay or doosraa sardiyon ke dauraan
 Generally, the prices of vegetables are very slightly up and down throughout the year, sometimes due to the off-season, sometimes due to the increase in diesel-petrol prices
 lekin jaise hi mausam karavat letaa he subjiyon ke daam aasmaan chune lagate hai
 Tomato grew and in the capital of Leshdesh, the rising prices of tomatoes have freed the people
 rajdhani kii sabase badi ajadpur mandi main bhi tamaato 60 se 80 rupee kilo bik rahaa he jo ki khudara bazaar tak pahunchate-pahunchate 100 rupee se 120 rupee kilo tak ho jaataa he
 This is the same tomato which was selling at a price of 20 to 30 rupees per kg about 25 days ago, but in the last 25 days, the price of these tomatoes has risen by about 500%
 ajadpur mandi main tamaato ke thok vikreta ashok kowshik ne bataaya ki june ke maheene main jo tamaato 5 se 10 kilo bik rahaa tha, vah june ke aakhri hafte main 40 rupee prati kilo tak pahunch gaya tha
 Since the beginning of July, tomato prices have seen a boom, which is still intact
 ajadpur mandi main tamaato maharashtra, karnataka or himachal pradesh se aata he lekin is baar tamaato sirf himachal pradesh se hi aa rahaa he
 Due to the absence of tomato market from other states, heavy rains and spoilage of crops are being reported
 lihaaja desh main tamaato kii paidaavaar kam hone se tamaato kii keemton main oochaal aayaa he
 According to the wholesalers, tomato prices will still remain strong
 15 agast se pehle tamaato ke saste hone ke asaar bilkul nahin he
 It is clear that expensive tomatoes will not only spoil the taste of your food, but will also be heavy on your pocket
 agle varsh chunaav ke maddenjar tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri je jayalalita ne rajya kii mahilaon ke liye muft main swasthya jaanch ke ek kaarykram kii ghoshnaa kii he

 agali baar aap agar date par jaaen to sanbhalkar, kyonki ek adhyayan main yah paaya gaya he ki ankhen prem or vaasana main antar ko samaj sakati hai
 According to a study, 'if one looks at the face of a stranger, it shows that he has love for a stranger in his heart
 agar dekhne vaale kii nigaah sharir ke anya bhaagon par bhatakati he, to tay he ki vah vaasana ke vasheebhoot he
 'according to Stephanie Cacioppo, director of the University of Chicago's High Performance Electrical Neuro Imaging Laboratory,' the conclusion is that eye movements indicate whether you have a love or desire for a stranger
 'nae adhyayan main shodhakartaaon ne do vibhinn bhaavnaatmak avasthaaon romantic lav or vaasana ke akalan ke liye do pareekshan kiye
 Geneva University students and students were shown pictures of two opposite-sex youth, in which they are interacting with each other

 Cacioppo said, "the pictures (in which two opposite sexes were looking at each other's faces) were told that there was love in their eyes
" jabaki waisi tasviren (jisamen nigahen chehre se phisalkar sharir ke anya bhaagon par thi) ke bare main kaha gaya ki unki ankhon main vaasana he
 'john Cacioppo says,' It is known from your eyes whether you have love or lust in your heart
 ' The Ministry of Human Resource Development has rated 6 educational institutions in the country as excellent institutions
 in sansthaanon main 3 sarkari or 3 nijee santhaan shaamil hai
 a name is also appearing in these private institutions, whose name is not very popular and has included it in excellent institutions
 is santhaan kaa naam he jeeyo institute
 The special thing is that the name of this Jio Institute has not been heard even before and its existence is not visible on the Internet either
 sarkaar kii ore ek 'bina astitv' vaale college yaa uniwarsity ko utkrisht santhaan main shaamil karne se kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 According to reports, the Jio Institute is an institution of Reliance, but the institute has not started functioning yet
 vahiin twitor par bhi is santhaan kaa ullekh nahin miltaa
 Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar too could not find any Twitter handle of Jio Institute announcing the name of these institutions and he had to write the same name
 NEET main nahin mili acchhee ranking! in 5 corcej main banaaen kariyarbataya ja rahaa he ki aane vaale kuch saal main yah santhaan astitv main aa saktaa he
 According to The Print website, UGC says that when it comes into existence after three years, it will have more atonomy
 saath hi ise green field category ke adheen chunaa gaya he
 However, information about Jio Institute's campus, courses etc
 is not available on the internet yet
 yah ek projected santhaan he
 According to the website, panel officer n Gopal Swamy says, "we have selected the Jio Institute under the Greenfield category, which is meant for new institutes and has no history
" hamanen prapojal dekha or iske liye chunaa
 They have a plan for a location, they have funded and they have a campus and everything required for this category
 'ye hai dilli uniwarsity ke best college, dekhen-puri listakya he institute of emnansis list main shaamil hone se sansthaanon ke str or gunvattta ko teji se behatar banane main madad milegi or paathyakramon ko bhi joda ja sakegaa
 Apart from this, whatever is necessary in the direction of creating a world-class institution, will be done
 jaavdekar ne bataaya ki ranking ko behatar banane ke liye tikaoo yojana, sampoorn swatantraaa or saarvajanik kshetra ke sansthaanon ko saarvajanik vitt poshan kii jarurat hoti he
 It is being told that this is far ahead of hierarchical autonomy and is really like full autonomy of institutions
 isse santhaan apana nirnay le sakenge
 Today's decision is complete autonomy in a way and this will ensure that no student is denied the opportunity of education and facilities like scholarship, interest waiver, fee waiver
 jaadui paharipoon, vishaal jharanon, ghaatiyon, sampann itihaas or vividh adivasee samskruti vaala purvi rajya jharkhand ek virodhabhas kaa naam he
 The state is full of diversities and wealth in terms of natural resources like forests, minerals and rivers, where it rains a lot and where the soil is very fertile
 lekin baavjood iske yahaan kii zyaadaatar janata behad garibi main apana jivan basar karti he
 Jharkhand accounts for 40 per cent of India's total mineral wealth, but in terms of value, this state only accounts for 10 per cent of the country's total mineral production
 ek doosraa virodhabhas yah he ki yahaan shaharikaran or udyogikaran kii shuruyaat 1907 main hi ho gai thi, jab tata company ne jamshedpur main ek steel sanyantr sthapit kiya tha or kareeb sau saal pehle hi dhanbad desh kii koyala rajdhani ke rup main viksit ho chukaa tha
 But despite these achievements, today Jharkhand is one of the states with the highest rural population after 110 years
 varsh 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar, yahaan shahari aabaadi 24 fisadi he jo ki 31 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat se kaaphi neeche he
 The third paradox is that even though the state started as a manufacturing and mining hub, recent figures show that the sharpest decline has been in the manufacturing sector, while the situation here is surprisingly good in terms of services
 
 seva kshetra main ijapha menuphaccharing kii keemat par aayaa he, jo 2004-05 ke 34 fisadi se girakar 2013-14 main keval 20 fisadi par aa chukaa he
 During this period, the share of the services sector increased by 12 percent, while that of the manufacturing sector decreased by 14 percent
 chauthaa virodhabhas yah he ki jharkhand desh kii koyale kii rajdhani he
 The state is an iron ore mining center including mica, manganese and bauxite
 yahaan bharat ke do sabase bade steel sanyantr maujuud hai—pehla tata kaa jamshedpur main sthapit nijee sanyantr or doosraa 1964 main bokaro main sthapit sarkari steel sanyantr
 Despite this, in the case of most human development indices, this state comes at a very low rank among 29 states
 jharkhand main aakhir aise virodhabhas kyon hai? yah rajya jis nimna stareey santulan ke gatirodh main fansaa he, kya usase baahar nikalne kaa koi rasta he? is paheli kaa jawaab india today kii rajya kii dasha-disha intelligence report main mil saktaa he
 The state's condition-direction (SOTS) reportindia Today's annual state-direction survey states that India's future resides in its 29 states
 yahi kaaran he ki 2003 ke baad isaki report rajyon ke pradarshan kaa moolyankan karne ke liye ek paimaana ban chuki he
 The state's direction (SOTS) is its logical culmination, in which we have done an X-ray of each state, SWOT analysis of it and also micro-analysis at the district level
 ab sidhe jharkhand par aate hai: 24 jile, 16 varsh, maanav vikaas kii 9 shreniyan, jinamein prayek ke kuch ahm paimaane hai
 The SOTS report takes a holistic view of the historical changes and economic, social and human development in Jharkhand
 is report main ek nishchit samyavadhi main uplabdh tulanaatmak or vishwasaneey data ke aadhaar par ahm shreniyon main rajya kaa moolyankan kiya gaya he (is prakaar ke aankade 24 main se 18 rajyon ke liye uplabdh hai)
 The SOTS report of Jharkhand conveys a comprehensive picture of the conclusion, draws a roadmap for the future of the state and sets out a model identifying the top priorities that can completely rejuvenate the state's economy and its strengths
 Recognizing it could provide a good regime
 ye nishkarsh chaunkaane vaale hai
 The story is full of surprises, including unexpected results that challenge common sense
 ek str par dekha jaae to is rajya kii kahani kai virodhabhaason se bhari hui haih dekhne main sampann lekin hakeekat main garib, udyogikaran ke maamle main apane shuruaati daur main, lekin shaharikaran ke maamle main behad pichhadaa hua
 At another level, the story also describes the changing fortunes of the districts of the state, where there is tremendous competition among various administrative units and where the rate of improvement in backward areas is faster than in developed areas
 kul milakar ham yah kah sakate hai ki yah sabase buniyadi prashasnic ikai yani jilon ke naatakeey utthan or patan kii ek kahani he
 Apart from ranking districts in different categories, this study also answers some important questions: What are the main drivers of development? How do economic and social changes occur? What makes people strong? How does the state rejuvenate? What are the impediments in the path of economic progress? What is the reason for the contradictions in which Jharkhand finds itself implicated? What is the final way out of this low-level equilibrium stalemate? In the end, the broader and important issue is that if Jharkhand has to achieve its goal of economic rejuvenation, what should be its top five priorities? The common sense states that the higher the level of industrialization, commercialization and urbanization, the higher the level of human development
 The level will be equally high
 is lihaaj se ve rajya zyada aage honge, jinke udyogikaran, vanijikaran or shaharikaran kaa str ooncha hoga
 Like any state, the economic development of Jharkhand meets this traditional rut to some extent, but when we look at the rate of change during the last 16 years, many surprising facts are revealed to us
 masalan, apekshaakrit pichde jilon ne viksit jilon ke mukaable tej gati se tarakkee kii he
 Hence, East Singhbhum district headquartered in Jamshedpur, the steel city established by Tata, may have topped the rankings in some categories, but the rate of change (pace of improvement in the last few years) in the relatively backward districts like Pakur or Deoghar was faster than in Jamshedpur
 May go
 isliye jamshedpur jahaan he, vahaan use banaae rakhana or uskaa anukaran karnaa utana hi ahm he, jitna yah ki pakur or devgarh ko viksit kiya jaae
 This trend seems parallel to emerging economies competing with developed Western nations in global competition
 iskaa aashay yah he ki pichde hue ko protsaahit karne se vruddhi teevr hoti he or zyada samta aati he
 This report is divided into five sections
 parichay main hamane jharkhand kii mukhya samasyaon yani chaar virodhabhaason kaa zikr kiya
 To understand these contradictions, in the next section we will compare Jharkhand with the two newly formed states of Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, which were formed in the year 2000 with Jharkhand itself
 saath hi shesh bharat or bihar ke saath bhi isaki tulana karenge, jisase katkar jharkhand ko banaaya gaya
 Thirdly, we have evaluated the performance of states in nine categories to know the micro-picture
 yah ranking do staron par he—ek sarvshereshth pradarshan ko dikhaati he to duusari badlaav kii dar ko dikhaati he
 Finally we come to the broader picture and provide a possible solution to the problems of Jharkhand with the help of SOTS study
 hamane vijeta jilon par alag se ek box bhi diya he
 Compared to the three states formed in 2000, after the partition of Bihar, the whole state of Jharkhand was more prosperous than the other two states it had formed with the mineral wealth formed on 15 November 2000

 There was a multiplicity of natural resources
 lekin iske baavjood ye donon rajya aaj sakal gharelu utpaada or maanav vikaas suchakaankon ke maamle main jharkhand se kahin aage hai (dekhen graphics)
 in the most comprehensive survey public affairs index report 'governance in the States of India 2016' conducted by Bangalore-based Public Affairs Center : Jharkhand lowest in all 29 states in the category of 'women and children' Notch is on, Chhattisgarh is at 22nd place, while Uttarakhand is at 17th position
 isi tarah maanav vikaas ke maamle main jharkhand 26wein, chhattisgarh 25wein or uttarakhand nauven sthaan par he
 Jharkhand ranks 24th, Chhattisgarh 20th and Uttarakhand ninth in terms of infrastructure
 jharkhand pichhadaa kaise?jharkhand baaki donon rajyon se peeche kyon rah gaya? adhiktar paryvekshak iske teen kaaran ginate hai: rajnatik asthirataa, netaaon kaa baari bhrashtachar or fret imvalijeshan (puure bharat main samaan rup se aarthik vikaas ko badhaava dene ke liye bharat sarkaar kii ek vishesh niti) kii adoordarshee niti, jisane kai dashakon tak jharkhand main audyogic gatirodh ko banaae rakhaa (tatkaaleen bihar main)
 The real game is of political instability, which has been like a curse since the birth of Jharkhand
 apane janm ke baad 16 saal ke dauraan ai 13 sarkaron main is rajya main kul chah mukhyamantri hue, jabaki chhattisgarh main keval do mukhyamantri hue to uttarakhand main saat
 Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das admitted that the real reason behind the state's economic and social backwardness was political instability
 das ne india today se kaha, ''jharkhand ke aarthik pichhadepan kii mukhya vajah rajnatik asthirataa he
 i am the first Chief Minister, whose government is the majority government
 kismat kii baat he ki dilli or ranchi, donon hi jagah ek hi party (bijepi) kii bahumat vaali sarkarein hai
 Due to this, the economic growth of Jharkhand will accelerate in future
 ''ateet main yahaan bhrashtachar bhi jabardast rahaa he or kai aise ghotaale rahe hai, jinhone samay-samay par sarkaron ko hilaayaa he
 Former Chief Minister Madhu Koda was arrested in the mining and coal scam
 bhrashtachar ke maamle main bihar se alag hone se pehle hi yah kshetra badnaam rahaa he
 The fodder scam took place here, in which RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav was found guilty and was punished
 is bhrashtachar kaa ek cheharaa khanan kshetra main panpi mafia samskruti he, jahaan netaaon or kaarobaariyon ke bich gahari santhganth ke tamaam kisse hai
 a few years ago, a film showing the appearance of the mining mafia of the state has also been made Gangs of Wasseypur
 1952 se lekar 1993 tak centre sarkaar ne fret ikvalijeshan kii adoordarshee niti apanaai taaki desh bhar main udyogon kii samaan vruddhi ko sahaj kiya ja sake
 This meant that if a factory was set up in any part of the country, the center would give subsidy to transport the minerals to the place there
 is niti ne bihar or anya khanij sampada se bharpoor rajyon ke aarthik vikaas ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya, kyonki isane in rajyon main utpaadan centre sthapit karne kii nijee puunji kii pahal ko hatotsahit kiya
 Former Chief Secretary of Jharkhand P

 Says Sharma, "the policy of freight equalization caused tremendous damage to the Jharkhand region and the state of Bihar for four decades, creating a deadlock in industries and making mining completely helpless
" ''baaki desh se jharkhand kii arthvyavastha kii tulanasana 2000 main gathan ke baad se jharkhand kaa aarthik dhaancha kaaphi kuch badal chukaa he
 Based on the data from 2004-05 onwards, the following conclusions can be made with reference to the changes made here
 san 2004-05 main jharkhand ke aadhe se zyada yani 52 fisadi jidipi kaa strot udyog tha
 Apart from this, 15 percent came from agriculture and 33 percent from service sector
 udyogon ke bheetar jidipi kii hissedari teen mukhya kshetron main banti ja sakati haih menuphaccharing 34 fisadi, khanan 11 fisadi or construction 7 fisadi
 In comparison, industries accounted for only 31% of India's total GDP, while mining accounted for 4
 3 fisadi thi or seva kshetra kii sabase zyada 41 fisadi hissedari thi
 The real change in this region-wise scenario of Jharkhand occurred between 2004-05 to 2013-14
 khanan kshetra kii hissedari to pehle jaisi hi bani rahi, lekin seva kshetra yani beemaa, doorsanchaar or aatithy kaa hissaa naatakeey tareeke se 45 fisadi tak aa gaya, jo ki 47 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat ke kaaphi kareeb tha
 But how did this happen? The growth in the services sector was at the expense of the decline in manufacturing, which had fallen from 34 per cent in 2004-05 to 20 per cent in 2013-14
 sankshep main kahen to seva kshetra kii hissedari main jahaan 12 fisadi ijapha hua, vahiin menuphaccharing kii hissedari main 14 fisadi kii giravat ai
 In other words, Jharkhand is now moving towards becoming a 'pure' Indian state, where agriculture, services and manufacturing sectors have come into a mutually comparable position
 in teenon kshetron kii rashtriya jidipi main hissedari 2013-14 main kramshah 16, 16 or 47 fisadi thi
 In Jharkhand, this ratio is 16, 19 and 45 per cent
 yadi ham vaastavik prati vyakti aay (2004-05 ke mulya par) or vaastavik jidipi main vruddhi or vaastavik jidipi prati vyakti ke hisaab se dekhen to bihar or baaki desh ke saath jharkhand kii tulana virodhabhaason kii ek kahani ke rup main saamne aati he
 The per capita income in Jharkhand is 70% of the entire India average
 3 fisadi thi, jo 2015-16 main maamuli giravat ke saath 67 fisadi par aa gai
 We get this information from the slow growth in per capita income in Jharkhand: national average 5
 9 fisadi ke mukaable 5
 5 percent growth rate
 iske ulat bihar, jo 2004-05 main rashtriya ausat ke mahaj 30 fisadi prati vyakti aay par tha, 2004-05 se 2015-16 ke bich kaaphi teji ke saath badha, jisaki dar 7
 5% per annum
 bihar main prati vyakti aay 2014-15 tak rashtriya ausat kaa 35 fisadi thi
 In short, Bihar grew at a rapid pace in terms of increase in per capita income, while Jharkhand's progress was slow
 jharkhand main jilon ke pradarshan kii rankingsatven vitt ayog ne rajyon ko jane vaale sansadhano ke hisse main badhotaree karte hue purvavarti kul kar rajasav ke 32 fisadi se use aaj 42 fisadi par laa diya he
 This means that the burden of expenditure on responsibility, policy and development will now be on the shoulders of more and more states
 kul 3
 Jharkhand, with a population of close to 1 crore, is about the size of Peru, which is the 40th largest country in the world (among a total of 204 countries)
 aise main sabase bada sawaal yah khadaa hota he ki jharkhand ke niti nirmaataa aakhir aisi koun-si nitiyaan apanaaen taaki beete 15 saal main vruddhi ke maamle main ausat se bhi neeche ke pradarshan main sudhaar laayaa ja sake—matlab ausat prati vyakti jidipi kii vruddhi rashtriya dar 5
 5 against 9
 6 par aa sake? dilli samet 21 bade rajyon ke bich prati vyakti vruddhi dar ke maamle main jharkhand abhi 13wein sthaan par he
 The SOTS study answers some such important questions and analyzes the districts at micro level
 lekin is raah main dikkat yah he ki adhyayan jitna sookshm hota jaataa he, aankadon kii uplabdhta utani hi kathin hoti jaati he
 Even if data is available, it becomes difficult to evaluate performance
 vikaas ke kuch paimaanon par is rajya ne yaa uske jilon ne kaisaa pradarshan kiya he? udhaaharan ke liye vikaas ke do suchakaankon ko lete hai—prati vyakti aay (yani jila kitna sampann he) or vah kitna 'shikshit' he
 However, before that, we also have to look at inherited issues
 aakhir 'aarambhik sthitiyon' ko kaise sangyaan main liya jaae? masalan, kerala main jivan str hameshaa se ooncha rahaa he, khaskar swasthya or shiksha ke maamle main to vah hameshaa hi aage rahaa he
 Going into the details of the data shows that Kerala's achievement in education has always been higher than the Indian states (at least since independence)
 isi tarah jamshedpur main audyogic vikaas ke chalate purvi singhbhum jila baaki jharkhand ke mukaable hameshaa se zyada sampann rahaa he
 Therefore, due to its 'initial conditions', East Singhbhum has retained its status as the richest district
 haalanki bharat jaise vikasshil deshon ke sandarbh main ek parighatna 'kaich ap' kii hoti he yani yah ki nirdhan desh (yahaan jile) sampann deshon (jilon) ke mukaable teji se vruddhi karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 This second scale has been used to assess the performance of districts in Jharkhand: what was the size of the improvement or rate of change over a given period of time (between 1999 and 2011 for this study)? Take two dimensions of performance — which district was the best performer in 2011 and which district showed the most improvement since 1999
 lekin is vishleshan kii raah main kai baadhaaen bhi hai
 If all the data is available, then there is a problem how you will evaluate the performance for several indices simultaneously
 Take an example: East Singhbhum achieved the highest achievement in women's education till 2011-12 (according to NSS figures), but Ranchi remained the highest in terms of education for men
 aise main shiksha ke lihaaj se kis jile ko sabase upar rakhaa jaae? aise tamaam sawaal, masalan prati vyakti aay, nipat nirdhantaa kaa str, purush or stri shiksha, ityadi ke sandarbh main kul pradarshan kaa akalan aisi shreniyon main ranking ke madhyam se kiya jayega, jo paraspar tulaneey na hon
 There is a system of ranking from best to worst for each index, with the best being 1 and the ranking of the worst being 18 (since we only have data available for 18 of the 24 districts, the 1999 NSS or 2000-01 census and Figures for 2011–12)
 isliye kisi bhi suchakank ke maamle main sarvshereshth rank 1 hogi
 Suppose East Singhbhum topped all four incomparable categories as appropriate
 yah chaar shreniyan hai- shaikshanik uplabdhi ke varsh, garibon kii sankhya or rupye main prati vyakti aay
 So in terms of rank, the overall composite score would be 4
 lekin ek baar ke liye ferj kiijie ki purvi singhbhum kaa mishrit score 10 he, to kya ab bhi use 1 rank di ja sakati he? haa, yadi kisi anya jile kaa mishrit score 10 se zyada ho
 In other words, we can achieve rank of rank, which is called Borda rank
 yah naam french ganitagya or raajnneeti vigyaani jyaan chalrs da borda ke naam par padaa he, jinhone yah tarika 1770 main nikaala tha
 The system of Borda rank is in vogue all over the world and it is used in practical work like selection of candidates in elections (system of nomination in our Rajya Sabha here should be removed from the present complex method and brought to Borda rank)
 borda rank kaa phayda yah he ki isamen ham kuch athulaneey shreniyon kii aapas main tulana kar paane main sakasham ho jate hai
 District rankings show that education has a direct and major role in reducing crime and improving health
 jilon main kul shiksha kii dar ne hatyaon kii dar ko nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit kiya he
 The average rate of education in a district increased by one percent to 0 per capita murder rate
 3 fisadi neeche le aata he
 Similarly, if there is an increase in the rate of education in a district, it reduces the rate of rape dramatically
 jile main purushon ke bich shiksha kii ausat dar main ek fisadi ijapha balaatkaar kii dar ko ek fisadi tak kam karata he
 Increase in men's education also reduces dowry deaths
 purushon kii shiksha main ausatan ek fisadi ijapha dahej hatyaon ko 2
 Reduces 2 per cent
 jile main mahilaon kii shiksha main ausatan ek fisadi ijaphe ke chalate prajnan 0
 Went down 15 percent and 0 in infant mortality
 32 fisadi kii giravat ai
 One percent increase in GDP 0 in settlement poverty
 75 fisadi giravat laati he
 One percent increase in average education minus the number of poor
 5 fisadi kam karata he
 In this context, education is the most decisive factor in the drivers of social and economic change and this is clearly revealed in India Today's SOTS study
 jharkhand sarkaar yadi rajya bhar main shiksha par or khaskar mahilaon kii shiksha par jor dete hue iske prasar kaa gambhir prayaas kare to aarthik or saamaajik vikaas ke maamle main chamatkaar kar sakati he
 Very important results have come out of this study
 jaisaa ki jharkhand kaa vishleshan bataata he, sarkaar ke liye sheersh paanch praathamiktaayen honi chahie—shiksha, swasthya, krishi, khanan or vinirmaan kshetra kii bahaali or pehle se hi ubhar rahe seva kshetra ko protsaahan dena, taaki vah or teji se vruddhi kar sake

 It depended on how we wanted to play

 Raut has now said that the media has 'misinterpreted' his comments
 unhone kaha ki alpsankhyak samudaay kaa vot daalane kaa adhikaar chhinana asanvaidhanik he
 Raut told reporters in Aurangabad on Tuesday, 'I did not write that the franchise should be withdrawn from Muslims
 maine sirf itnaa kaha ki agar unhen vot dene kii anumati nahin di jaae tomuslimon kaa prayog raajnneetik avasarvaditake liye nahin kiya jayega
 He continued, 'I did not say that Muslims should be deprived of their franchise
 media ko din ke liye kuch khabar chahie thi or unhone mere bayaan kaa galat matlab nikaala
 'it is worth mentioning that after the publication of the article on Sunday and the controversy over it, Shiv Sena's Legislative Council member and spokesperson Lelam Gorenne also took a soft stand on the article

 These people are only misleading them without really helping the community
 'kya likhaa tha lekh menraut ne ‘saamana’ ke ravivaar ke ank main ekalekh likhakar siyaasi tufanmacha diya tha
 In this, he demanded the abolition of Muslim suffrage to stop the use of Muslims as votebank by political parties

 His educational and health status is being used for politics
 yah raajnneeti pehle congress ne kii, lekin ab har doosraa vyakti khud ko dharmanirpeksh bataata he
 'he had said,' If Muslims are being used only for this kind of politics, then they can never develop

 with thousands of cries, like a dry wood dry fire
 Filled, both the wood have been extinguished now; Some are scattered like coal, some are extinguished, some are left out, when the hand of the person is blown on the walls


 your love is left and the hand of life is broken
 (one meeting) i was standing silent and unmoved, there was a storm in the ocean just flowing

 Along with sports and studies, yoga was also an essential part of our daily life when we were growing up

 Yoga is an exercise, meditation, a way to stay healthy

 The joy of yoga is that it moves slowly and with ease
 samay ke saath aap yoga ke vibhinn asana main siddhhast hote jate hai
 My instructor has always told me that you should not see yoga as an exercise only, but as an effective way to keep the body shapely and healthy
 *** Superstar Salman Khan has denied reports of a quarrel with actor Aamir Khan and praised Mr
 Perfectionist's upcoming film Dangal saying that his story is very good
 donon actors ke bich kuch maheene pehle ek party main jhagada hone kii khabar ai thi
 There has been a long-standing speculation between the two about the plot of 'dangal' and 'salman' starrer 'sultan', which is being made on the life of a Haryanvi wrestler
 salmaan ne kaha, 'mere or aamir ke bich daraar kii in khabaron main koi sachai nahin he, aap jaanate hai ki ise kaise likhaa jaataa he
 There was nothing like that
 'bajrangi bhaijan' starasalamaanane kaha ki agar donon filmon ke bich tulana kii gai to unhen acha nahin lagegaa kyonki donon ek-duusare se bilkul alag film hai
 He said, 'both films are very different
 main jaanata hum kiamirakya bana rahaa he
 Dangal has a story about a father and his two children based on a spectacularly real incident
 yah shandaar or asaadhaaran film he
 My film is actually a romantic film
 'sultan'khel ke bare main he or ek vyakti apane jivan ko phir se paane ke liye kaise sangharsh karata he uski kahani he

 input: PTI Jaganmohan Reddy has moved the Supreme Court to stop the ongoing investigation into the disproportionate assets case
 sutron ke mutabik jagan apni yachika main aarope lagaaya he ki uske khilaaf jaanch congress ke ishaare par ho rahi he
 The petition said that political opponents are using the court for their own benefit
 congress or tidipi unki lokapriyata se dar gaye hai isliye wo unhen fansaa rahe hai
 a petition was filed against Jagan by an Andhra Pradesh minister after which the High Court ordered the CBI to get the property investigated
 rajasthan ke ajmer main ghoosekhori kaa aisa racket saamne aayaa he jo na kabhi aapane suna hoga or na dekha hoga
 SP, Additional SP and CO were all part of this bribery racket
 sabase hairaani kii baat ye ki espi sahab ko eemaandaaree ke liye isi 26 janvari ko raashtrapati mahoday sammanit karne vaale the
 The Anti Corruption Bureau caught the SP of Ajmer taking a bribe of three lakh rupees through a broker
 kahani yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 When the captain's house was raided, many such documents were found which expose the entire racket
 police ne jab is jaal se jude dalal se poochtacha kii to pataa chalaa ki espi sahab ke maatahat puraa police unit hi ugaahi ke khel main fansaa he
 The entire racket acted like an organization

 Whoever came to these officers had to come only through the broker Ramdev
 dalal ramdev bhi laal batti kii gaadi main ghumta tha or paise lekar maamla set karata tha
 People had to pay money for any case
 in logon ne sabhi thanon ko vasuuli kaa target bhi de rakhaa tha
 Small stations had to give 10 to 20 thousand daily
 bade thanon kaa target par de 50 hajaar rupee kaa tha
 The amount caught was also recovered from the SHO of 13 police stations and brought the broker to the sp's house
 espi ke ghar se ek diary bhi mili he jisamen sabhi thanon se lenden kii entry mili he
 The police can also make these Thanedars an accused
 jaanch main saamne aayaa he ki har somvaar ko adishnal espi kaa massej har thane ke SHO ke paas pahunch jaataa tha ki jaldi aao ramdev ji aa gaye hai
 The message was stirred to meet the target, but it is being said that such a conspiracy cannot be done without the connivance of big officials
 shaq isliye bhi kiya ja rahaa he kyonki espi ko na keval out of turn pramotion mila balki raashtrapati padak ke liye bhi naam bheja gaya he

 In fact, security forces found a sniper rifle during a search operation on the route of the Amarnath Yatra, after which it was decided to stop the yatra

 kya sarkaar sthaneey logon ke liye bhi is tarah kii adwijuri jari karegi
 Should Kashmiris also be displaced elsewhere or does their life matter
 JK Govt has asked Tourists and Amarnath Yatris to leave Kashmir immediately in view of a security threat
 Is the Government considering any such advisory for locals also? Should Kashmiris also migrate to other places or is it that our lives do not matter? Pic

 aap log jald se jald apni yatra ko puri karke laut jaaen
 With this, the Amarnath Yatra has been stopped
 ye yatra 15 agast tak chalani thi, lekin roak di gai he
 Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has tweeted and expressed his displeasure and concern over the sudden advisory on the abolition of the yatra for tourists in the state
 unhone kaha ki syriasli? aapane sochaa he ki ek sarkari aadesh se paryatak jaldi se ghati chhodkar bhaagane lagenge? kitne paryatak is aadesh ko dekhakar bhaagane lagenge
 People fleeing will jam the airport and the highway
 Seriously? You think an official order telling tourists to leave immediately will not cause them to run from the valley as fast as they can? Which tourist will hang around after seeing this order
 The airport & highway will be choked with people leaving
 https: / / t

 haalanki isse ghati main maujuud dar ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Although this unprecedented order would seem to suggest a genuine fear of a massive terror strike directed at Amarnath ji yatris or / and tourists this will do nothing to dampen the sense of fear & foreboding that prevails in the valley at the moment

 Pakistan's Minister of State for Finance Hamad Azhar on Tuesday presented the annual budget towards the Imran Khan government
 yah imran khan kii aguai vaali pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) kii sarkaar kaa pehla purnakalik bajet tha
 3 in the budget of 6 lakh crores (6 trillion)
 56 lakh karod kaa baari-bharkam bajet ghaataa he
 Pakistan's economy is struggling with a huge crisis
 jis din pakistan sarkaar ne apana bajet pesh kiya, uske thik ek din pehle pakistan kaa 2018-19 kaa aarthik survey jari hua
 It states that Pakistan's GDP in FY 2018-19 is just 3
 3 fisadi kii dar se aage bad rahi he
 This is the lowest level in the last 9 years
 pakistan berogari or mahangaai jaise muddon se bhi jujh rahaa he
 On the other hand, GDP growth rate has also declined in India
 saal 2018-19 main yah 6
 Has come down to 8%, which is the lowest level in the last five years
 haalanki, giravat ke baavjood bharat kii arthvyavastha padosi pakistan kii tulana main kaaphi aage he
 India's economy ($ 2600 billion) is about 9 times larger than Pakistan's economy
 india today data intelegence unit (diaiu) ne donon padosi deshon- bharat or pakistan ke bajet kii tulana karke jaananaa chaha ki donon desh kaise or kitna kharch karte hai
 The recently presented budget in Pakistan says that there is so much debt on Pakistan that a large part of its budget, that is 42 per cent, is spent in repaying the loan interest
 jabaki bharat kaa karj niyantran main he
 India spends only 18 per cent of its total budget on debt repayment
 iskaa nateeja yah he ki bharat apane bajet kaa 20 fisadi sarkaar kii kalyankari yojanaon par kharch karne main sakasham he jisase puure desh kii aarthik sthiti majboot hoti he
 However, Pakistan only 10 of its total budget
 3 fisadi hi aisi sarkari yojanaon par kharch karata he
 Apart from paying interest, Pakistan has the highest expenditure on defense sector (17 per cent)
 jabaki bharat apane kul bajet kaa maatr 8 fisadi hi raksha par kharch karata he
 Despite this, India's defense budget is six times more than Pakistan's defense budget
 yahaan tak ki rajkoshiya ghate ke maamle main bhi pakistan kii haalat behad kharaab he
 Talking about the difference between India and Pakistan on the economic scale, this difference gets deeper when comparing the foreign exchange reserves
 bharat kaa videshi mudra bhandar 420 billian dollar he, vahiin pakistan kaa videshi mudra bhandar maatr 17
 4 billion dollars
 yani bharat kaa videshi mudra bhandar pakistan ke videshi mudra bhandar se 24 guna bada he

 The goal of this development is not to ensure the sanctity and uninterruptedness of the Ganges, but instead, it keeps its eyes on the monkey budget of the budget allocated for cleaning the Ganges
 aisa saalon se hota rahaa he or aage nahin hoga isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 In such a situation, Professor BD Tripathi, who was a member of the Ganga River Basin Authority, says that where is the Ganges water left in the Ganges, which is being talked about to be cleaned? Whatever water is in the Ganges is of drains or tributaries
 gomukh se gangasagar tak hazaron naalon or kal kaarkaanon kaa rasayan sidhe ganga main giraaya ja rahaa he
 Despite this, Ganga has so much potential that it can eliminate the effect of all these toxic substances
 lekin mushkil ye he ki iske liye gangaajal kii jarurat he jo ab ganga main bachaa hi nahin he
 Ganga waterprofessor Tripathi is no longer in the Ganges, says that there is not only mythological but also scientific reasons behind calling Ganga a mother
 darasal ganga main khud ko saaf karne kii naiysargik kshamta he jo himalay se bahane vaali kisi anya nadi main nahin he
 The reason for this is the path of the flow of Ganga which is called Bhagirath Path
 gomukh se jab ganga nikalati he tab teen tarah ke eco system banaati he
 First, when the water of the glacier melting from the Himalayas passes through the Bhagiratha path, the minerals from the rocks of the mountains are also brought with them
 jo kaaphi phydemand hote hai
 Secondly, the Ganges water also moves through the roots of medicinal trees growing on the Himalayas, due to which its water has medicinal potential
 teesraa ganga ke jal main bactereophej virus hote hai, jo jeevanuon va anya hanikaarak sookshm jeevon ko samaapt kar dete hai
 These qualities of Ganga have been confined to the mountains due to the changing of the course of the Ganges and the stopping of the Ganges by the Tehri Dam
 vahiin maidani ilaakon main ganga kii talahati main pradooshan ke kaaran itane hanikaarak rasayan ikaitha ho gaye hai jinke bare main koi charchaa nahin karata

 At the time of the Atal government in 1999, questions arose whether this dam would harm the spiritual power of Ganga? Hence Atal constituted a committee under the chairmanship of senior BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi to examine the negative impacts on the Ganges due to the dams and the earthquake impact on the Tehri dam
 is cameti main chaar sadsy vishwa hindu parishad ke the
 On the spiritual significance of the Ganga, this committee said that by putting a pipe with a circumference of 10 cm or 4 inches in the dam, the flow of the Ganges will remain and its avidity will be maintained

 The Mahaseer fish found here also reached the verge of extinction due to the dam being built in Tehri and the Ganga's flow stopped

 Then Professor GD Agarwal, on a hunger strike, retired from IIT Kanpur, Professor GD Agrawal says that the construction of Lohari Nagpala, Bhairav valley and Pala Maneri dams on the Ganga's main tributary river began after the Murli Manohar Joshi Committee submitted its report

 bharat ke sabase khubasurat shaharon main shumaar gulabi nagari jaipur ko unesco ne world heritage city ghoshit kar diya he
 From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, people have greeted people on the occasion of Jaipur
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne twit kiya, 'jaipur bahaduree or samskruti kii viraasat saheje ek shahar he
 Jaipur's grand and enthusiastic hospitality attracts all the people
 mujhe khushi he ki jaipur ko unesco ne vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main chinhit kiya he
 'rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted,' It is a matter of great pride that our pink city Jaipur has been declared a World Heritage City by UNESCO
 isse rajasthan kii rajdhani jaipur kaa gaurav badhegaa
 He said that declaring Jaipur as a World Heritage Site is not only a matter of pride, but it will also boost tourism and boost the local economy
 saath hi buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar hoga
 Every year millions of tourists from all over the world come to see the beauty of the old city of Jaipur
 yahaan aane waalon kii ricomendation par hi unesco ne jaipur ko world heritage city ghoshit kiya he
 After becoming a World Heritage City, the number of tourists will increase here
 saath hi aitihaasik imaaraton ke sangrakshan ko or behatar kiya ja sakegaa
 The central government has already declared Jaipur as a smart city
 iske liye kaam bhi jari he
 The city of Jaipur is an example of a planned development, surrounded by the boundary wall of the park and has 7 doors
 jaipur basane se pehle kushwahon kii rajdhani amer hua karti thi
 But in the year 1727, former Maharaja Jai singh started the construction of Jaipur
 yah shahar alag-alag kaal khandon main banakar taiyaar hua
 There is a temple of Govind Dev Ji in the old city just opposite the former royal house of Jaipur
 jaipur ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki nagar niyojan yahaan parampara rahi he
 This is the reason that even during the royalty of the state, the width of the roads inside the park was 107 meters, while the market verandah used to be 92 meters in width
 saal 1896 main jab prince of wales jaipur aa rahe the to unke swaagat main jaipur ke purv maharaj ne puure shahar ko gulabi rang se rangava diya tha, tab se is shahar kii pahchaan gulabi nagari ke rup main hoti he
 Major monuments here include Amer, Nahargarh, Jaigarh Jal Mahal, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar City Palace and Albert Hall
 yahaan ke pramukh bazaaron main johri bazaar, kishanpol bazaar, badi chapad, choti chapad or chandpol shaamil hai
 With the changing times, the appearance of Jaipur city has also changed and by November this year, Metro will also be started in Old City

 admician prakriya:viteeekorsa kaa naam:master of technology in information technologydegree:emtemovadhi:2 salyogyata:beatechedmician prakriya:viteee a poverty-stricken rape victim is forced to sell her three-month-old baby girl for three thousand rupees to pay the debt
 maamla upi ke sitapur kaa he
 The victim says that she is very poor
 ghar main khaane ke bartan ke naam par sirf do hi bartan he, jisaki vajah se vah bacchee kaa paalan-poshan nahin kar paa rahi thi
 Within 3 months, he had increased the debt of milkmen, medicines and people of the area
 logon ne apana-apana paisa bhi maangana shuru kar diya tha, jisaki vajah se usko maasoom ko bechney jaisaa kathor kadam uthaanaa padaa
 Taking the news of selling the innocent seriously, SDM Sadar reached the spot and talked to the family of the victim and promised to provide government facilities
 esadm sadar ne is baat ko mana ki parivaar main kaaphi garibi he or suvidha ke naam par kuch nahin he
 This is the reason why the family members troubled by poverty and debt have sold the innocent for 3 thousand
 gauratlab he ki upi ke sitapur jile memrape kii shikaar15 saal kii naaballig garbhvatee peedit ladki kaaphi samay se lagaataar adhikariyon ke chakkar lagaati rahi, lekin wo aaropee ladke ke khilaaf aakhir tak mukadmaa nahin likhva saki
 Meanwhile, the victim girl gave birth to a cute baby girl after 9 months on 18 December 2014 at the government hospital in Khairabad
 bachche kii khabar sunate hi police waalon ke hosh phakhta ho gaye
 On the same day, the police registered a case against the accused in the Pasco Act, including Section 376A, but did not arrest the accused
 rape ke aaropee ko sajaa dilaane ke liye peedit maa maasoom ko lekar pichley 3 maheenon tak lagaataar adhikariyon ke yahaan chakkar lagaati rahi, kaaphi mashkkat ke baad peedita aaropee ko giraftaar karvaa kar jail pai, lekin phir bhi police ke aaladhikari camere ke saamne khud bolne se bachate najar aae
 This Muslim family living in Khairabad town, 8 km from Sitapur, is very poor
 ghar ke naam par ek choti se jhuggi he
 Only 2 utensils appeared in the names of cooking utensils, the place where this family lives is also a small piece of land given to someone
 is parivaar ke paas sarkari suvidha ke naam par kuch nahin he
 No government scheme ever reached this family
 saal 2014 is parivaar par kahar ban kar tutaa
 In January 2014, Siddha Ali, a minor girl of the same house, residing in her neighborhood, raped her on the pretext of marriage
 aarope he kii peedit ke garbhvatee hone ke baad aaropee ne shaadi kii baat kah kar maamle ko rafa dfa karne kii koshish kii
 When the case cooled down, the accused refused to marry
 maamla thane pahunchaa, lekin vahaan par bhi koi madad nahin mili
 After this, the pregnant girl, a pregnant victim, kept circling daily from the police station to the top police officers, but the merciless authorities paid no attention to her helplessness
 aakhirkaar 3 maheenaa pehle naaballig peedita ne sarkari aspataal main ek maasoom se bachche ko janm diya
 This poor Muslim family somehow managed to raise the innocent for 3 months by taking loans from the people, but people started asking for their money back, which caused the distressed mother to cut a piece of her 3-month-old debt to repay the debt
 Sold a family for just 3 thousand rupees
 parivaar ko isse bhi raahat nahin mili karj kaa bhaar aaj bhi parivaar par he or log apane karj kii vaapasi maang rahe hai
 After demolishing the left fort in the Tripura assembly elections, the state now has a BJP government
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh biplab deb ne shuukravaar ko rajya ke nae mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath lee
 Jishnu Dev Verma will be the Deputy Chief Minister
 25 saal kii vampanthi sarkaar ko bhale hi chunaav main bijepi ne kadi shikast di ho, lekin nai sarkaar ke saamne paanch mudde aise honge jinase nipatna chunautiyon bharaa hoga
 Let's know those five challenges
 
 
 1
 Though Tripura may lead in terms of literacy, removal of unemployment here has been a challenge for all governments
 gyaat ho ki apane chunavi menifesto main bijepi ne har yuva ko rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya he
 In such a situation, it is a big challenge to fulfill this promise
 2
 Despite being full of natural resources, there is a lack of industries and factories in Tripura
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bijepi ne tripura main vishesh aarthik kshetra (sej) sthapit karne kii baat kahi thi
 Thus, the challenge for the BJP will be to acquire land and set up new industries
 3
 Apart from unemployment, industry and education, providing health care in Tripura has been a big challenge
 bijepi ne ames kii tarj par ek aspataal ke alaava kai multispecialist aspataal kholane or rajya ke swasthya dhaanche kii tasviir sudhaarney kaa vaada kiya tha
 4
 tripura main bangladesh seemaa se ghuspaith or taskari rokna sarkaar ke liye gambhir mudda rahegaa
 Because infiltration has increased in the state in the last few years, it has also led to many violent incidents
 sarkaar ko ise rokane ke liye suraksha agenciyon ke saath milakar kade niyam-kanoon banane honge
 5
 iske saath hi rajya main vibhinn adivasee sanghathanon kii ore se uthne vaali alag rajya kii maang se bhi nipatna sarkaar ke liye sabase badi chunauti rahegaa
 Let us tell you that in many states of the North East, tribal organizations have demanded a separate state

 Leader of disgruntled Congress mlas in Assam and state education minister Hemant Biswa Sharma resigned as minister today, protesting the leadership of Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi
 apana istipha rajbhavan main saunpane ke baad unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'maine mantri ke rup main apana istipha rajyapal (jebi patnayak) ko de diya he, kyonki maine gogoi ke netritv kaa virodh kiya he
 "he said," About 38 mlas accompanied me to Raj Bhavan, but this was my personal visit
 ham apni party ke liye lard rahe hai or 2016 main gogoi ke netritv main congress ikai ke aankade par aa jaaegi
 ' hemanth ne kaha, 'vahaan puri tarah avyavashtha he or gogoi ke tahat koi tay disha tak nahin he
 It is not politically, mentally and physically possible to continue working under Tarun Gogoi
 yah uchit nahin he
 That is why i decided to resign
 main mukhyamantri ko bhi apana istipha bhejuungaa
 ' ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki abhi gogoi sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 'we do not want to topple the government
 ' unhone kaha ki rajyapal ko suchit kar diya gaya he ki unke saath gaye sabhi 38 vidhayak vidhansabha main 'sakaaratmak vipaksh' kii bhoomika nibhaayenge
 Hemant said, 'we will oppose Gogoi's anti-people policies
 lekin jab bhi party vip jari hogi, ham iskaa paalan karenge kyonki ham party adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii avhelnaa nahin karnaa chaahate
 ' bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)ne kendriya mantri giriraaj singh (giriraj singh) par ek baar phir nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He (nitish Kumar) said on Wednesday that people who make non-essential comments have no religion
 dhyaan ho ki giriraaj singh (giriraj singh) ne kuch din pehle nitish kumaar ke iftaar party ko lekar ek photo twit kiya tha
 He wrote that how good it would have been if all of them kept fast in Navratri also
 giriraaj singh (giriraj singh) ke is bayaan ko bihar kii maujuuda raajnneeti main bijepi-jediu ke bich badhati duuri ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 In fact, after the drastic victory of the NDA in the Lok Sabha elections, the Modi government did not include any JDU leaders in its cabinet
 is baat ko lekar nitish kumaar ne apni naaraazgi bhi jataai he
 Significantly, after this statement of Giriraj Singh, BJP President and country's Home Minister Amit Shah reacted strongly
 unhone giriraaj singh ko is tarah ke bayaan dobaaraa na dene kii hidaayat bhi di thi
 Giriraj Singh, who is often surrounded by controversies with his statements, has questioned the key leaders of his own coalition party
 maaloom ho ki 2008 se 2010 ke bich vah nitish kumaar kii sarkaar main mantri bhi rahe
 Only after this statement of Nitish Kumar, Amit Shah intervened in this whole matter and instructed Giriraj Singh
 amit shah ne giriraj singh ko phone karke kaha tha ki is tarah kii shikaayat aage se nahin aani chahie
 Explain that before Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar, this statement of Giriraj Singh was also condemned by LJP leader Chirag Paswan
 unhone enditivi se baatcheet main kaha tha ki giriraaj sar (giriraj Singh) aise twit karte rahete hai
 i think the media is taking Giriraj Singh's tweet a little too seriously
 is vivaad main giriraaj singh ko clinit dene par chiraag paswan ne kaha ki nirantarata main unke kai bayaan aae hai
 There should never be a politics of appeasement, never do politics of religion or caste
 piem ne khud aise bayaanbaji se bachane kii naseehat di thi
 However, we each have our own ideology
 ham usee par chal rahe hai
 During the conversation when he was asked if you would meet Giriraj Singh? Would you ask them why you tweeted so? On this, Chirag Paswan said that i will definitely ask him when i meet him, but i feel that we are giving too much attention to the statement of any one

 Modi emphasized that the party and the organization should do more work and spread the message among the poor including Dalits and Adivasis that the central government has done many things including Jan Dhan, Mudra Debt, Ujjwala LPG and the latest Ayushman Bharat What a great job for them through insurance schemes

 Since Diwali, the level of air pollution in delhi-ncr has increased considerably, due to which the number of patients in hospitals has increased by 30%, on the other hand, despite the orders of the National Green Tribunal, farmers of Punjab and Haryana have been burning fearlessly
 The problems of the people of delhi-ncr are increasing further
 ek anumaan ke mutabik keval punjab rajya main har saal 19
 7 million tonnes of straw is produced, most of which is burned
 punjab main ab tak paraali jalaane kii 1378 shikaayatein darj kii gai hai
 Taking action on these complaints, the state government imposed 7 on the farmers
 27 lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bhi kiya he
 All these complaints are of paddy straw, earlier this year, during the harvesting of wheat, 11000 complaints of burning straw were received and 61 on farmers
 3 do lakh rupee jurmaana thoka gaya tha, haalanki pichley saal kii tulana memparali jalaneke kam maamle darj hue hai lekin kisaanon par sarkaar kii sakhti kaa koi zyada asar nahin hua he
 73 on charges of burning stubble in Punjab farmers last year
 2 lakh rupee jurmaana kiya gaya tha
 However, the exact amount of penalty charged is not available
 darasal udhar karjamaafee ke maamle par baikfoot par ai punjab sarkaar kisi bhi surat main kisaanon se sakhti nahin baratna chaahati
 The state government has made it clear that it cannot manage to burn stubble because there is no money in its coffers
 iske liye rajya sarkaar ne kisaanon ko paraali ke prabandhan main istemaal hone vaali mashiinon par sabsidi dene ke liye centre ko 1109 karod rupee kii ek yojana centre ke krishi mantralay ko bheji thi jo filon main hi lataki he
 In this regard, the National Green Tribunal has summoned the reply from the Union Ministry of Agriculture
 punjab sarkaar kisaanon ko paraali prabandhan ke liye mashine kharidne kii salaah bhi de rahi he lekin mashiinon kii keemat itani zyada he kikisanuse kharidne main asamarth hai
 Farmers are already burdened with debt and the government is advising them to take loans by giving them subsidy, which is not acceptable
 gauratlab he ki choper shreder mashin kii keemat 4
 5 lakh to 6 lakh rupees, cutter rake baler machine price 16 lakh rupees and Happy Cedar machine price 1
 25 lakh se 1
 40 lakhs, which is falling on farmers' pockets
 haryana main paraali jalaane ke 437 maamle darjapadosi rajya haryana main bhi kisaan bedadak paraali jala rahe hai
 So far, 437 stubble burning cases have been registered with the help of satellite and a total of 115 firs have been registered
 rajya sarkaar ab tak kisaanon se chaar lakh rupee jurmaana vasuul chuki he 
 The state government had claimed that it was making farmers aware of scientific management of the straw
 sarkaar ne haryana state aplicoshan centre agency kii sevaayen lekar satellite kii madad se har roj un jagahon ko chinhit kar rahi he jahaan par kisaan paraali jala rahe hai
 All reports are being taken to the Pollution Control Board so that action can be taken against the guilty farmers
 sarkaar ne paraali se utpann hone vaale pradooshan ko rokane ke liye har jile main jiladhish kii adhyakshata main vishesh timen gathit kii hai jisamen pradooshan niyantran vibhaag, krishi vibhaag or police vibhaag ke karmchaaree shaamil hai
 The governments which failed to keep the farmers 'favor, while the Punjab and Haryana governments are imposing fines on the farmers but have failed to present the farmers' favor in front of the National Green Tribunal
 haar kar ab kisaanon se jude sanghathan bhartiya kisaan union ne engiti ke samaksh pesh hokar kisaanon kaa paksh rakhaa he
 The farmers have argued before the NGT that even if they manage their starch then who will buy it and who will bear the cost of stubble management? Farmers' organizations have demanded that the crop is already a loss deal, the cost of growing the crop in one acre is between three and four thousand rupees and from above, the cost of stubble management is added separately to two thousand rupees per acre
 All the earnings of the stall will be eaten
 kisaan sanghathanon kii baat sunne ke baad engiti ne kendriya krishi mantralay or antipisi ko talab kiya he ki kya vah kisaanon kii paraali kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 At present, the matter is under consideration of the NGT and in the next fifteen days, the farmers will reap the crop because most of the crop has been harvested till now

 andhra pradesh main loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko jabardast vijay dilwane ke baad rajasekhar reddy ek kushal netaa ke rup main ubhar chuke hai
 Reddy took the oath of office and secrecy for the second consecutive term of the post of Chief Minister
 vipaksh kii ekajutata or shashan ke khilaaf kaarak se ubarte hue wiesar ke naam se mashhoor reddy ne pradesh ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko jabardast jeet dilwaai
 The Congress performed brilliantly in the state, winning 33 out of 42 seats in the Lok Sabha and 156 out of 294 seats in the assembly
 wiesar pradesh main congress ke aise pehle mukhyamantri hai jinhonen andhra pradesh main paanch saal ke purna kaarykaal ke baad satta barkaraar rakhane kaa karnama kar dikhaaya
 Reddy, 59, took over as the Chief Minister of the state in the year 2004
 vah daur party kaa sabase kharaab samay tha, kyonki party das saal ke baad satta main lauti thi
 It was a tough challenge for Reddy, the son of a mason in Kadapa district of the state, but he always shone through difficult times
 medicin main snaatak karne ke baad unhone kuch samay tak practice kiya
 In the mid-1970s, he began his political career with the Congress

 After a break in the Congress, Reddy left the party and Reddy joined the Congress
 indira gandhi ke khilaaf vidroh kar reddy congress kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 After the dissolution of the Congress, Reddy returned to the Congress again and was again appointed the head of the State Congress in 1997
 vah aise samay main congress adhyaksh bane jab pradesh main telugu desham party kaa janaadhar majboot ho rahaa tha or unke purv party sahyogi en chandra babu naidu kaa janaadhar bad rahaa tha
 However, the best moment for him came when the Congress won in 2004
 das saal ke antaraal ke baad pradesh main ek congress sarkaar kaa gathan kiya gaya
 The Congress Party admitted that in 2003, Reddy undertook a 1450 km trek

 Nearly eight years ago, during the hearing of a case related to Ayodhya, the Supreme Court remarked that "the courts can pass judgment on the dispute but cannot solve the problem
" '' pichley saptaah elahabaad hycourt kii lakhanu peeth na to vivaad par faisla suna saki, na hi samasya kaa samaadhaan kar saki
 In such a situation, the irritated people started asking each other, "when will this story end?" Actually, a two-member bench of the Supreme Court decided the Lucknow bench of the High Court in the 1949 case over the ownership of the disputed site
 Barely 24 hours before i said, what is the harm in giving the last chance to the settlement? In view of basic facts and past experiences, the Supreme Court may have a convincing reason for this decision, but the sudden halt of the judgment caused a major political and social setback

K

 lekin peeth ke pramukh nyaayamurti rabindran ne nyaayamurti gokhale kii raay maan lee
 In this judgment, Justice Ravindran said, "when there is a difference of opinion among the judges, the tradition is to issue a notice
" ''ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle main prativaadee number-17 ramesh chandra treepathi ne isse pehle elahabaad hycourt main 24 sitambar ko aane vaale faisle ko taalane kii arji di thi magar unki arji khaarij kar di gai
 Subsequently, Tripathi filed a petition in the Supreme Court

 His lawyer Sunil Jain listed other reasons for the upcoming Commonwealth Games, elections in states, Kashmir and Naxal problems

 Justice Dharmveer Sharma, a member of the three-judge bench, expressed dissent over Tripathi's rejection of the application, saying, "I believe that if anyone can be a compromise, then do the agreement and by 23 September, that is, one of the verdicts File a reconciliation day before

 Now with the decision of the Supreme Court, the matter has reached such a point from where it is likely to get entangled in the game of snake-ladder
 hycourt kii teen jajon kii peeth main se dharmaveer sharma aagaamee 1 aktubar ko ritair ho jaaenge
 If the Supreme Court slashes it even after 28th, then Sharma's role will end
 divaani prakriya samhita ke niyam-2, order 20 ke tahat sharma ritair hone se pehle apana faisla likhvakar us par dastakhat kar dete hai to unki jagah aane vaale jaj us faisle ko pard sakate hai
 But if Sharma retires without writing the verdict, then it may take time for the new judge to replace him
 nyaayadhish sharma ko seva vistaar bhi diya ja saktaa he
 This has happened before also

 ojha ko sirf isi naate seva vistaar diya gaya tha ki ve us maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the or unke ritair hone ke baad faisle main deree ho sakati thi
 Jilani believes that the Congress, the Sangh Parivar and the state administration were against the verdict for their own reasons
 congress ko ashanka thi ki kisi bhi tarah ke vipareet faisle kii ghadi main ek baar phir use musalamaanon kaa gussa jhelana hoga, sangh parivaar ko lag rahaa tha ki faisla uske khilaaf gaya to uske adhiktar kaaryakarta hatotsahit ho jaaenge or rajya prashasan ko ashanka thi ki is faisle se kanoon-vyavastha kii gambhir samasya paidaa ho jaaegi, jisase 'louh mahila' ke rup main mayawati kii chhavi bighad sakati he

 Since 1999, BJP has been losing its advantage in elections on this issue
 yahaan tak ki ram mandir nirmaan ke chunavi abhiyaan bhi khaas prabhavi nahin hai
 Now the BJP is confused because it is realizing that the temple issue is not a medium to garner votes
 ek ore jahaan bhaajapa asamanjas main he to congress ko lagata he ki uske saamne sabase badhiya vikalp hakeekat se munh mode lenaa he
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said, "people are fed up with giving political color to this sensitive issue by RSS, VHP, BJP
" unhone yah bhaajapa ke jariye hote dekha he
 Also, the circumstances of 2010 are different from 1992
 '' ramchandra guha jaise buddhijiviyon kii yah bhi raay he ki badalte vakt main bhaavnaatmak mudde kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 "the English- speaking middle class has gone ahead
" bhavy mandir kaa sanketwad maryaadit jivan kii jagah nahin le saktaa
 "the principal historian Patrick French said," Such a generation of voters is ready who does not even remember the Ayodhya crisis
 ''nabbe ke dashak main ayodhya sangharsh main dahaadane vaale muslim netaa yuvaaon ke badalte soch ke maddenjar khamosh ho gaye hai
 Syed Shahabuddin, former diplomat and head of the Babri Masjid Movement Coordination Committee (BMMCC), said, "the demand for the community has now changed to education, easy bank credit and representation in Parliament
" yah nai soch he
 "now every radical Hindutva leader accepts that politics has resulted in the loss of the case
" hindutv brigade kaa netritv karne vaali vihip ne pichley saptaah apane 25 lakh trishuldhari kaaryakartaaon se kaha ki lakhanu peeth ke faisle par koi pratikriya na dikhaae
 "we must ensure that public sentiments do not turn against Hindu organizations
" 
 
 is mudde par koi sakht ravaiya nahin apanaaya jayega
 "before the decision was deferred, Jilani also said that there should not be an angry response from either side because" (high Court) verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court and Muslims can decide the same (supreme Court) verdict
 Will assume that will be final
 ''sadaa ladane ko taiyaar bajrang dal ke sansthaapak vinay katiyaar ne bhi tevar naram kar diya he
 He says that the solution to this problem can be reached only through an agreement or law

 He went to Ayodhya but could not stir anything
 hakeekat yah he ki ram janmabhumi andolan ko dishanirdesh dene vaale kai varisht netaa faisle ke din ayodhya main nahin rahane vaale the
 The Sangh Parivar also decided not to take the initiative to heat Ayodhya before the decision
 apane khoe janaadhar ko hasil karne ke liye baichaiyn bhaajapa ko bhi ayodhya maamle se alag hi rahane ko kaha gaya
 This time again the VHP has no public awareness campaign
 vah sirf desh bhar ke mandiron main anwarat hanuman chalisa kaa jaap karvaa rahi he
 Muslims have also changed their mind due to the old age of high-profile leaders and the lack of interest of the younger generation

 VHP spokesperson Sharma told India Today that not only BJP but every party tried to take political advantage from this movement
 jab yah andolan apane charam par tha tab bhaajapa ne hindu matadaataaon ko rijhne kaa prayaas kiya
 Hence, the then BJP chief Advani took out a 10,000-km Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, while the then Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav felt that this was his chance to become the spokesperson of the Muslims, hence he made a provocative statement like "parinda will not be killed"
 ve ''maulavee mulaayam'' ban gaye
 And in order to garner Hindu votes, the Congress gave permission for Shilapujan in Ayodhya
 baad main ram rath ke nayak adwani ne librehan ayog ke samaksh sweekaar kiya ki ve ''kisi dharmik bhaavana ke nahin balki rajnatik kaarnon'' se andolan main shaamil hue the
 In addition to the court battle since 1949, efforts are being made at the political level to resolve the matter
 vishwanath pratap singh ne 20 november, 2008 ko librehan ayog ke samaksh gavaahi main kaha tha ki 1989 main unke pradhanmantritv kaal main sulah kii pahal kii gai thi
 VHP international president Ashok Singhal opposed his attempt to find a solution peacefully
 singhl ne kaha tha ki congress ne shilanyas kii anumati dekar unke sanghathan ko behatar avasar diya tha

 isse pehle is pad ke liye prithviraj chavaan kaa naam chal rahaa tha
 But now Nana Patole's name has been approved by NCP leader Praful Patel
 aapako jaanakar hogi ki saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhandara se bijepi ke tikat se naanaa patole ne chunaav ladaa tha or praphul patel ko haraaya tha

 To find Praful's cut, BJP gave Nana Patole a ticket from Bhandara
 aaj jab praphul patel ne naanaa patole ke naam kaa spikar pad ke ummidavaar ke liye aage badhaayaa to naanaa patole kii tarif karte hue kaha ki vah kisaanon or garibon kaa netaa hai
 When Nana Patole was asked about NDTV by Praveen Patel, who had caused great political harm to Praful Patel, he said that Praful Patel is our elder brother and his blessings are with him
