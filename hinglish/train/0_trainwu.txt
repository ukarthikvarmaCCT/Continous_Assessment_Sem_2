 People of this area are in panic due to this incident
 "ghar kii buniyaaden deevaaren bamodar the baboojisbako baandhe rakhane vaale ek hunar the babuji"in linon main babuji yani pita ke na rahane kaa jo dard he, wo jantar-mantar pahunche un bacchon kii ankhon main bhi dikhaa jinhone karj se dabe apane kisaan pita ko kho diya he
 Forty children of farmers whose father had committed suicide in Maharashtra at different times at Jantar Mantar because they were unable to repay the debt due to loss in agriculture and, being upset, they chose a path to embrace death
 pita kaa saaya sir se uthne ke baad parivaar kii wo pareshaani to khatm hui hi nahin jisaki vajah se uske mukhiya ne maut kaa gale lagaaya tha, balki un par museebaton kaa pahaad sa tut padaa
 These children have a more painful story than their own, to tell the farmers sitting at Jantar Mantar to tell in Parliament
 in bacchon ne dharna andolan kar rahe kisaanon se guzarish kii ki wo kisi bhi haal main maut kaa rasta na apanaaen kyonki isse samasya khatm nahin hoti balki kisaanon ke pariwaron ke liye, unke bacchon ke liye abhishaap ban jaati he
 Among these forty children, 15-year-old Ashok Patil's father was a farmer in Vidarbha
 lekin unhone karj main dabakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Ashoka was just four and a half years old then
 maa kii haalat aisi nahin thi ki wo puraa parivaar chalaa sake
 That is why Ashok was left in the ashram of Nashik and had to take up farming as usual
 pallavi bhi nasik ke ashram main rahati he or yaheen padhai kar rahi he kyonki uske pita ne fasal kharaab hone ke baad pareshaan hokar maut ko paanch saal pehle gale laga liya tha
 But this created a mountain of troubles for the family
 maa ko mazdooree kerani padati he
 The conditions of the house are such that even the people are hungry
 pallavi or ashok raav jaise kai bachche hai jinaki jindagi main ek cheez aisi he jisane unke jindagi ko dushwaar bana diya
 When the father was hurt, he embraced death and the father's shadow arose from the head of these children
 parivaar ne mukhiya kho diya, bachaa to sirf pita kaa suunaapan or museebaton kaa lanbaa silsilaa
 In such a situation, life does not remain easy for these children without father
 nasik main bacchon ke liye ashram chalaane vaale tryambak gaekwad kehete hai ki unke yahaan saadhe teen sau se zyada bachche hai, jinamein 182 ladkiyaan hai
 When all of these heads took care of their father, they had to take shelter in the ashram
 lekin sarkaar tab bhi unki sud nahin leti
 So now they take these children among the farmers and tell them that no amount of debt should be taken on them, they should not take the path of suicide because after this there is no one to take care of their families
 kisaan anndaatakahalata he lekin khudakushi karne ke liye majaboor he
 The government does not listen and there is no other way of earning
 agar ek saal fasal kharaab hui to musiibat, zyada fasal hone par daam nahin milte, laagat vasuul nahin hone paane kii pareshaani, lekin ye sab abkisaanon kii niyatiban gai he
 Because in the era when governments are ignoring the demands of the farmers in need, what should the farmers do in that period

 But many believe that such an event can happen

 May 13 blast in Jaipur
 
 
 mobile number 9811004309 band26 july , ahmedabad main blast
 
 
 Mobile number 9811004309 closed September 13 bomb blasts in Delhi
 
 
 mobile number 9811004309 bandabaaki dinon par hameshaa biji rahanevaala ye mobile dhamaakon ke din band he, auki isi band mobile se khul rahe hai wo raaj jo in tamaam bam dhamaakon kaa aaropee aatif amin kii maut ke saath hi dafn ho gayi the, ji haa ye mobile number aatif amin kaa he 
 
 
 
 
 The print out of Aatif's mobile phone 9811004309 received by Aaj Tak shows that somewhere he was connected to the conspiracy of these blasts
 ji haa, aatif kaa mobile phone hi aatif ke khilaaf ab sabase bada saboot banataa ja rahaa he
 If the phone is switched off, then many secrets stop with the same but the master mind of these serial bomb blasts
 yani aatif amin kaa mobile phone band hokar bhi kai raaj khol rahaa he
 Yes, that is, Switch of Mobile is revealing many secrets
 ab ham aapke saath aatif ke mobile phone ke print out ko khangaalana shuru karte hai
 On May 13, 2008, when there was a blast in Jaipur, Atif's mobile is active for ten minutes at 17 minutes on May 12
 ye baat uske phone print out se saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 After that, Atif's mobile is completely switched off on 13 May 2008
 or phir on hota he 14 may kii dopaher 01 bajkar 3 minute 19 sacand par
 After Jaipur, Ahmedabad city of Gujarat became the next target of terrorists
 26 july 2008 ko ahmedabad main huye dhamaakon ke saath aatif ke phone kaa rishta phir judata he
 At this time, Atif's phone is closed at 12
40 pm on July 23 at forty seconds
 ye phone phir se active hota he 27 july kii subah 10 bajkar 01 minute par
 This series of terror does not stop here
 is baar aatankwaadiyon ne chunaa desh kii rajdhani dilli ko
 It is worth noting that this time Atif's phone is not available for a day but only for a few hours
 jeen haa jab 13 sitambar kii shaam dilli dhamaakon se dahal rahi thi us shaam 05 baje se 07 baje tak aatif kaa phone phir se band tha
 Is the closure of the mobile phone on every blast day a mere coincidence or part of the conspiracy? When the Delhi Police caught Saif after the encounter, he revealed that his boss Atif had instructed everyone that everybody on the day of the blast Keep your phone off
 lekin band phone kii ye kadiyaan kuch is tarah mili he ki sajeesh ke khilaaf saboot banati ja rahi he

 purv captain maaikel clark ne kaha ki yadi smith ko 'brake' kii hi jarurat thi to unhen test siries ke baad hi waapas aa janaa chahie tha, do vanade match hone ke baad nahin
 Former Australian cricketer Michael Slater said, "can't understand why Smith is returning from the ODI series soon
" captain ko aakhri samay tak vahaan rahanaa chahie
 i don't understand Steve Smith returning early from ODI series
 The captain should be there to the end! @iheals@bigsportsbrekky # ausvsl - Michael Slater (@mj_slats) August 24, 2016 Not only Clarke and Slater, former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has also passed the verdict
 ek twit ke jariye unhone kaha, mujhe hairaani hui ki smith dakshin africa daure kii taiyaari ke liye waapas laut rahe hai

 Would any other @cricketaus captain done this? anna hajaare ke andolan ke dauraan mili daanrashi ko arvind kejariwal dwaara istemaal ke liye nikaal lene ke swami agnivesh ke aaropon kaa hajaare paksh ne khandan kiya he
 Hazare's colleagues said that there is transparency in the movement and that Agnivesh may have been making such allegations due to resentment
 hajaare paksh ne kaha ki janalokapal andolan ke liye bataur sachivalay kaam kar rahe sanghathan public coj research foundationaki ore se aamadani or kharch kaa byoraa is maheene ke ant tak jari kar diya jayega
 According to Hazare's partner Manish Sisodia, the details of our income and expenses are already on the website
 hamane pichley chah maheene kaa vishesh audit karaayaa he, jiske vivaran is maheene ke ant tak website par daal die jaaenge
 Regarding Agnivesh, he said, there is no fight with our Swami Agnivesh
 ho saktaa he ki vah naaraazgi ke chalate aisa kah rahe hon
 It is not our tradition to reverse what the elder says
 vah achche vyakti hai or ham unka sammaan karte hai
 Sisodia said that we had asked all the members present in the Ralegan Siddhi meeting in Ralegan Siddhi to become the trustees of PCRF
 ramlila maidan par hajaare ke anshan ke dauraan hi ghoshnaa kar di gai thi ki daanrashi pisiaref ke naam se hi ekatrit kii jaaegi
 Agnivesh alleges that Kejriwal misused the funds by depositing more than Rs 80 lakh in donations to his trust during Hazare's agitation
 unhone kaha he ki kejariwal ke sanghathan pisiaref trust main anna hajaare kaa naam shaamil nahin he
 a police officer of Patna Police found it expensive to ask for hotel rooms from a hotel owner for free

 When the hotel manager refused to give the room, an angry daroga called the hotel owner Ram Babu and gave him a lot
 daroga kii dhamkee bhare lahaze main hotel maalik ke saath yah baatcheet vahaan lage sisitivi camere main kaid ho gai
 In fact, the inspector threatened the hotel owner to get the hotel blacklisted
 itnaa hi nahin, khaaki vardi ke nashe main chur aaropee daroga ne hotel maalik se kaha, vah chaahe to uski baatcheet kii ricarding espi ko suna de
 Nothing can spoil it
 daroga kii dhamkee kaa yah videososhal media par viralhone ke baad patna ke diaiji or esaspi ne aaropee daroga ko line hajir kar diya
 The hotel owner says that the accused Daroga always used to book the rooms for free by misusing the uniform
 isi baat se pareshaan hokar hotel maalik ne tay kar liya tha ki vah aage se kabhi daroga ko muft main kamare muhaiyaa nahin karavaayega
 a year ago, a video of 2 minutes 26 seconds shocked the whole country
 dilli ke chidyaghar main vijay naam ke ek safed baagh ne baade ke andar apane jabadon se ek shaks ko maut de di
 But the question arose that who is the real responsible for the death of this man named Maqsood? White tiger, Maqsood himself or zoo administration? Video: White tiger caught in this way Maqsood's neck was killed due to his whims
 Maqsood: a committee appointed by the Center for Central Zoological Authority submitted its report in Delhi High Court on Wednesday
 Of
 safed baagh kaa shikaar bane22 saal ke makasuud kii mautke liye centre sarkaar ne use hi jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki usne chetavanee nahin maani or durghatanavash baade main ja gira
 The report stated that the zoo staff did their best under the circumstances that existed
 centre sarkaar ke vakil jasmit singh kii ore se daakhil kii gai report ke mutabik samiti kaa maananaa he ki makasuud baaghon ke prati apni sanak ke chalate hi durghatanavash baade main gir gaya
 a report is prepared on the petition of Maqsood's wife that this report was submitted on the petition filed by the wife of the deceased
 usne daawa kiya tha ki sarkaar ko laaparvaahee or suraksha chook ko lekar muaavja dena chahie
 He paid compensation of 50 lakh rupees
 report main chidyaghar kii suraksha khamiyaan ujagarhalanki hoicourt main pesh hui is report main makasuud kii maut ke liye chidyaghar prashasan ko zimmedaar nahin tehraaya gaya he
 But on the other hand, this report has also highlighted the security flaws of the zoo
 haadase kii jaanch ke liye bani cameti ne apni report main suraksha ko chaakchauband karne ke liye kai suzav die hai
 For example, employees should practice training for such incidents and periodically install mock drills and emergency alarms
 2 disambar se pehle halafanama daakhil karne kaa aadeshcourt ne ne centre ko aapadaa prabandhan ke liye kisi samiti kaa gathan hone kii jaankaree dete hue ek halafanama do disambar se pehle saunpane ko kaha he
 mps and mlas are public servants
 unhen bhi sarkari khajaane se vetan bhatte milte hai
 In such a situation, how far it is ethical, legal and proper to advocate them, a three-member committee of the Bar Council of India will give its report on this matter on Monday
 council ke chairman manan mishra ne bhi ummid jataai he ki shuukravaar ko cameti ko di gai teen dinon kii mohalat khatm ho jaaegi to aise main somvaar tak report aa jaaegi
 On the petition of BJP leader and Supreme Court advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, the Bar Council had sought a detailed report by forming a three-member committee
 upaadhyaay kii yachika ke mutabik baar council ke vidhaan or niyamavali ke mutabik kahin se vetan paane vaala koi bhi vyakti vakaalat nahin kar saktaa
 Because advocacy is a full-time profession
 aise main saansad or vidhayak jab sarkari khajaane se vetan or bhatte lete hai to court main practice kaise kar rahe hai
 The petition states that as long as anyone is in a post like MP or MLA, his practice as a lawyer should be banned
 shapath lete hi uskaa license tab tak suspend kar dena chahie jab tak wo saansad yaa vidhayak he
 Upadhyay has attached the Supreme Court's Judgment in 1994 in this regard
 isamen privet practice karne vaale doctor ko court ne kaha ki, wo tab tak vakaalat ke yogya nahin maane jaaenge jab tak ki wo doctor ke pad se istipha naa de den
 In such a situation, the question arises that when a doctor cannot advocate from two places with salary and allowances, then how can MP and MLA
 is yachika par cameti banaae jane or saansadon-vidhayakon kii vakaalat practice par lataki talwaar se sabase zyada pareshaan philhal to congress se jude netaa hai
 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha mps, who have been advocates in the High Court and Supreme Court, include luminaries like Congress Kekpil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, p Chidambaram, Vivek Tankha, KTS Tulsi
 vahiin tiemasi ke kalyaan bannerjee, ensipi ke maajid memon jaise bade naam shaamil hai
 Former minister of UPA government, Congress leader and Senior Advocate Salman Khurshid even said that if the council takes action against mps-mlas in this matter, it will not be appropriate
 isse pehle unka paksh bhi suna jaae
 Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Congress spokesperson and senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi says that this will fill the Parliament with unemployed people
 lekin baar council kii niyamavali main 48 se lekar 52 tak ke praavdhaan saaf-saaf kehete hai ki vetanbhogivakaltanhin kar saktaa
 Hence, all eyes are set on the first day of the new year when the report will be submitted

 gujarat main chaudaa maheene kii ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana ne ek nai paristhiti paidaa kar di he
 Some people of the society of which the child belongs, have seen it with the pride of their society
 ve samuhik rup se ugr ho gaye hai
 It can be said that within this society, people ready to become a crowd have got the chance
 isliye thakor logon ne isamen shaamil aropiyon kii saamaajik prishthbhumi ke sabhi logon ko balaatkaar main shaamil samaj liya he
 It is not his fault
 haal ke dinon main balaatkaar ko raajnneetik rup dene ke liye dharmik prishthbhumi ko ubhaara gaya taaki uske bahaane ek samudaay par tut paden
 Uproar if the accused is a Muslim but the accused is a Hindu and the victim is a Dalit
 peedita ke saath hui krurta ke bahaane dharmik golbandi kaa mauqaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 The same work is being done at the level of caste also
 haalanki gujarat ke sabhi dalon ne is ghatana kii ninda kii he
 Alpesh Thakor, leader of Thakor society, has also condemned and appealed
 vahaan kii sarkaar ne bhi uttar pradesh, bihar or madhya pradesh ke logon ko bhagane kii ghatana kii bhi ninda kii he
 Gujarat Police is active in this case
 dhamkaane vaale 300 se adhik logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The people of Thakor society opposed the BJP
 agar balaatkaar kaa maamla dharmik rang le letaa tab dekhte ki gujarat police kya karti
 Does not do anything
 phir bhi is maamle main police ne sakhti barti he
 The Chief Secretary and the Chief of Police have shown activism
 isliye is maamle main donon taraf ke samaaj ko samajhane kii zarurat he
 Work has to be done to give confidence to the law and to make the society aware against rape
 in sabake bich jin logon ko ahmedabad kii bason main ladaa kar tees tees ghante kii asahneeya yatra par nikalnaa padaa he, unki yah pidaa puure desh ko sharmasaar kare
 How sad it is
 upi bihar ke logon ne is mulk ko sasta or umdaa shram dekar sanvaara he
 It is not right to make them laugh at everything
 isi gujarat se 2014 main bason main bharkar ye log upi bihar ke gaanvon main bheje gaye the taaki ve narendra modi kaa prachaar kar saken
 To share the false dream of Gujarat model
 majaburi main mazdoor kya karata
 Gone and came preaching
 in logon ke saath gujarat ke shaharon or dehaton main marpet kii ghatana saamne ai he
 Landlords have threatened to leave the state
 itani asahansheeltaa thik nahin he
 There should not be Gujarat vs UP Bihar
 netaaon ne aapako baant diya he
 Now you are just a piece of meat for him
 bade netaaon kii shakl dekhakar chote str par bhi netaa banane ke liye log yahi farmula aazamaa rahe hai
 Do not let such people flourish anywhere in Gujarat and Bihar
 ham har samay ek anya kii talash main hai
 First they decide on the basis of religion, then in the name of caste and then in the name of language
 aisa nahin he ki upi-bihar main bheed nahin he
 In Supaul, Bihar, the goons along with their parents and relatives attacked the girls hostels
 35 ladkiyaan ghayal hai
 These girls had opposed the daily molestation
 baarah se solah saal kii ladakiyon par puraa samaaj tut padaa
 Nearly forty girls were exploited in a girl child in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, there was no movement in the society there
 us samaaj ko ab sirf ramanavami or moharram ke dinon main talwaar lekar daudane aata he
 The rest who are not running, are happy to find the reason to justify sitting at home
 bihar or upi main pichley dinon dharmik aadhaar par jo bheed banakar paaglon kii tarah gum rahi he wo nai nahin he
 Just new is that it is more organized than before
 tyoharon or jaanwaron ke hisaab se uske kaarykram tay hai
 The enemies of the crowd are determined and who will benefit from this mob program
 soshal media par bheed banane kii factry he
 This crowd is making us insecure
 ham khud ko is bheed ke hawaale kar rahe hai or bheed ke naam par samaaj or sarkaar main gunde paidaa karne lage hai
 Of course it is a matter of resentment but there should be a focus on how to get punishment, how the system should work
 jo log shaamil the unke saath narmi na ho magar baaqiyon ko qasuurvaar kyon samajha jaae
 Where does this mentality come from? Its training comes from communal politics
 ham khandit hote ja rahe hai
 Violence has remained the sole objective of mobilization
 kisi ko maarna ho to paaglon kii bheed jamaa ho jaati he
 Four people are not available for any other work

 However, all the parties of Gujarat have condemned the incident
 thakor samaaj ke netaa alpesh thakor ne bhi ninda kii he or apil kii he
 The government there has also condemned the incident of exorcising the people of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh
 gujarat police is maamle main sakriy he
 More than 300 people arrested for bullying have been arrested
 thakor samaaj ke logon ne bhaajapa kaa virodh kiya tha
 If the rape case had taken a religious color, we would have seen what the Gujarat Police would have done
 kuch nahin karti
 Still, the police takes strict action in this matter
 cheef secetry or police pramukh ne sakriyata dikhaai he
 Therefore, there is a need to explain the society on both sides in this matter
 kaanoon kaa bharosa dene ke liye or balaatkaar ke kilaaf samaaj ko jaagruk banane ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 Amidst all this, the pain of those who have had to leave the buses of Ahmedabad on an unbearable journey of thirty hours, shame the whole country
 yah kitna dukhad he
 The people of UP Bihar have supported this country by giving them cheap and good labor
 har baat par unhen haank dena thik nahin he
 From Gujarat, in 2014, these people were sent to the villages of UP Bihar by filling them in buses so that they can promote Narendra Modi
 gujarat model kaa jhootha sapana baant saken
 What would a worker do under compulsion chalaa gaya or prachaar kaa kaam kar aayaa
 Incidents of assault have been reported with these people in the cities and countryside of Gujarat
 makaan maalikon ne dhamkaaya he ki rajya chhod do
 Such intolerance is not good
 gujarat banaam upi bihar nahin hona chahie
 The leaders have divided you
 ab aap uske liye maatr maance kii boti rah gaye hai
 Seeing the appearance of big leaders, people are trying this formula to become leaders even at small levels
 aise logon ko gujarat main or bihar main kahin bhi panpane na den
 We are looking for one another all the time
 pehle dharm ke aadhaar par ek anya tay karte hai phir jati ke naam par phir bhashaa ke naam par
 It is not that up-bihar is not crowded
 bihar ke supaul main gundon ne apane maa baap or rishtedaar ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke hostel par hamalaa kar diya
 35 girls are injured
 in ladakiyon ne rozaana kii chhedhkhani kaa virodh kiya tha
 The entire society broke down on girls between twelve and sixteen years old
 bihar ke mujaffarpur main ek balika grih main qareeb chalis ladakiyon kaa shoshan hua, vahaan ke samaaj main koi halchal nahin hui
 That society now only comes to run with a sword in the days of Ramnavami and Moharram
 baaqi jo nahin daud rahe hai wo ghar baithkar sahi tehraane ke kaaran khoj kar mast hai
 In Bihar and UP, on a religious basis, the crowd that is roaming like crazy is not new
 bas nayaa yah he ki pehle se zyaada sangathit he
 Its schedules are fixed according to festivals and animals
 bheed ke dushman tay hai or is bheed ke kaarykram se kise laabh hoga vah bhi
 There is a factory to create a crowd on social media
 yah bheed hamen asurakshit kar rahi he
 We are giving ourselves to this mob and in the name of the crowd, they have started creating goons in society and government
 beshak aakrosh kii baat he lekin sajaa kaise mili, system kaise kaam kare is par fokas hona chahie
 Those who were involved should not be soft with them, but why should the rest be treated as innocent
 yah maansikta kahaan se aati he? isaki training sampradayik raajnneeti se milti he
 We are becoming fragmented
 golbandi ke liye hinsa ekmaatr maqasad rah gai he

 Such intolerance is not good
 gujarat banaam upi bihar nahin hona chahie
 The leaders have divided you
 ab aap uske liye maatr maance kii boti rah gaye hai
 Seeing the appearance of big leaders, people are trying this formula to become leaders even at small levels
 aise logon ko gujarat main or bihar main kahin bhi panpane na den
 We are looking for one another all the time
 pehle dharm ke aadhaar par ek anya tay karte hai phir jati ke naam par phir bhashaa ke naam par
 It is not that up-bihar is not crowded
 bihar ke supaul main gundon ne apane maa baap or rishtedaar ke saath milakar ladakiyon ke hostel par hamalaa kar diya
 35 girls are injured
 in ladakiyon ne rozaana kii chhedhkhani kaa virodh kiya tha
 The entire society broke down on girls between twelve and sixteen years old
 bihar ke mujaffarpur main ek balika grih main qareeb chalis ladakiyon kaa shoshan hua, vahaan ke samaaj main koi halchal nahin hui
 That society now only comes to run with a sword in the days of Ramnavami and Moharram
 baaqi jo nahin daud rahe hai wo ghar baithkar sahi tehraane ke kaaran khoj kar mast hai
 In Bihar and UP, on a religious basis, the crowd that is roaming like crazy is not new
 bas nayaa yah he ki pehle se zyaada sangathit he
 Its schedules are fixed according to festivals and animals
 bheed ke dushman tay hai or is bheed ke kaarykram se kise laabh hoga vah bhi
 There is a factory to create a crowd on social media

 We are giving ourselves to this mob and in the name of the crowd, they have started creating goons in society and government
 beshak aakrosh kii baat he lekin sajaa kaise mili, system kaise kaam kare is par fokas hona chahie
 Those who were involved should not be soft with them, but why should the rest be treated as innocent

 aisa nahin he ki upi-bihar main bheed nahin he
 In Supaul, Bihar, the goons along with their parents and relatives attacked the girls hostels
 35 ladkiyaan ghayal hai
 These girls had opposed the daily molestation
 baarah se solah saal kii ladakiyon par puraa samaaj tut padaa
 Nearly forty girls were exploited in a girl child in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, there was no movement in the society there
 us samaaj ko ab sirf ramanavami or moharram ke dinon main talwaar lekar daudane aata he
 The rest who are not running, are happy to find the reason to justify sitting at home
 bihar or upi main pichley dinon dharmik aadhaar par jo bheed banakar paaglon kii tarah gum rahi he wo nai nahin he
 Just new is that it is more organized than before
 tyoharon or jaanwaron ke hisaab se uske kaarykram tay hai
 The enemies of the crowd are determined and who will benefit from this mob program
 soshal media par bheed banane kii factry he
 This crowd is making us insecure
 ham khud ko is bheed ke hawaale kar rahe hai or bheed ke naam par samaaj or sarkaar main gunde paidaa karne lage hai
 Of course it is a matter of resentment but there should be a focus on how to get punishment, how the system should work
 jo log shaamil the unke saath narmi na ho magar baaqiyon ko qasuurvaar kyon samajha jaae
 Where does this mentality come from? Its training comes from communal politics
 ham khandit hote ja rahe hai
 Violence has remained the sole objective of mobilization
 kisi ko maarna ho to paaglon kii bheed jamaa ho jaati he

 Union Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne kaha he ki bharat kaa baluchistan se koi lenadena nahin he or unhone aashcharya jataayaa ki aakhir bharat aisa kyon karegaa jab uski pakistan se satee seemaa par kai samasyaayein hai
 Chidambaram made it clear that the Congress would remain with the government on the issue of india-pakistan joint statement when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would speak about it in Parliament next week
 unhone kaha ki singh sansad main dastavej kaa ‘sahi arth’ bataayenge or yah byoraa denge ki usamen baluchistan kaa zikr kaise aayaa
 He said, "we are not involved in Balochistan
 hamaara pakistan kii aantarik samasya se koi lenadena nahin he
 In fact, the Baloch leader has said that he has not received any support from India
 ’’ chidambaram ne kaha, ‘‘iske alaava, ham baluchistan main kyon shaamil honge
 There are many problems along our western border with Pakistan
 ’’sarkaar vaktavy kaa bachaav kar sakati haichidambaram ne kaha, ‘‘mujhe bharosa he ki ise charchaa main laayaa jaayegaa ki aakhir kin paristhitiyon ke chalate vaktavy main baluchistan kaa ullekh hua
 On the reports of separate opinion in the Congress regarding the joint statement, the Union Home Minister said, "the party has said that the government can and will defend the statement
" maine yah suna he
 This will be discussed in Parliament and when it is discussed, you will find that the party is with the government
 ’’ chidambaram se jab videsh sachiv shivashankar menon ke is bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya ki yah bharat-pakistan ke sanyukt vaktavy kaa khaakaa kharaab tareeke se taiyaar hone kaa maamla ho saktaa he, to unhone kaha, ‘‘ab hamen vaktavy ke sahi arth ko dekhnaa hoga
 He said that the Prime Minister has already said that it is true that unless Pakistan takes action against terrorism, negotiations cannot begin
 rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne ek baar phir satta parivartan kaa janadesh diya he
 The Vasundhara government came to an end in the state and Ashok Gehlot has returned once again as the Chief Minister
 aksar jab satta parivartan hota he, tab pichhali sarkaar dwaara shuru kii gai kuch kalyankari yojanaayen yaa to band kar di jaati hai yaa phir unka naam badalte hue kuch chote mote sudhaar kar nae kalevar main unhen launch kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, in Rajasthan also the question arises that what will happen to the schemes launched by the Vasundhara government and what the people have lost due to the change of power? However, during the election campaign, former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had said that if he came to power So we will continue the good schemes of the previous government
 darasal yah sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai kyonki pichhali gahalot sarkaar ke kaarykaal main chalaai ja raheen saamaajik pension yojana, nickshulk dawa, nickshulk swasthya jaanch or anya yojanaon kii vasundhara sarkaar ne samiksha karai thi or kuch nai yojanaayen lagu kar di thim, jinamein swasthya ke kshetra main bhamashah swasthya beemaa yojana, bhamashah card ke alaava saarvajanik vitaran pranali main rashan kii dukaanon par pioes mashiinon kii anivaaryta lagu kar di gai thi
 During the campaign, the state Congress president had said that many flaws have been noticed under the Bhamashah scheme and if the Congress government comes, it will be reviewed
 congress ne apane ghoshnaptr main swasthya ke adhikaar ko kanoonee manyata dilaane kaa bharosa dilaane ke saath, muft dawa or ilaaj kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Apart from this, the mandatoryity of POS machines at ration shops can also be eliminated, because social organizations have protested about this
 congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main sabase bada vaayada kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa kiya tha
 The newly elected governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have signed the loan waiver files just hours after the swearing-in
 haalanki rajasthan main abhi isaki ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he kyonki vasundhara sarkaar dwaara kii gai aanshik karjamaafee ke aankadon kii samiksha abhi baaki he
 Apart from this, Congress in its manifesto promised unemployment allowance of Rs 3500 to the educated unemployed
 jabaki bijepi ne 5000 rupee berogari bhatta dene ke saath-saath har saal 3 xxrep 4 0 sarkari naukari or nijee kshetra main 50 lakh naukariyon kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Whereas Congress promised loans at cheaper rates to promote self-employment
 rajya main nivida karmiyon ke sankat ko dekhte hue congress ne vaayada kiya tha ki rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (NRHM) or rashtriya shahari swasthya mishan (NUHM) vibhaag ke nividakarmiyon ko niyamit kiya jayega
 It is worth noting that these health workers demonstrated in Jhunjhunu rally by showing black flags in the month of March of PM Modi
 vahiin bijepi ne iske vipareet nivida karmiyon ko bonus point ke aadhaar par naukari main praathamikta dene kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Talking about Panchayati Raj, the Congress had promised in its manifesto to abolish the rule brought by the Raje government for minimum educational qualification in Panchayat elections
 gauratlab he ki bijepi sarkaar ne ek kanoon banaakar yah niyam banaae the ki jila parishad or panchayat samiti ke pratyaashee kii nunatam shaikshanik yogyata 10veen tak honi chaahe or sarpanch kaa ummidavaar kam se kam 7veen paas ho
 Talking about the field of education, the Congress promised to make the entire education of girls free, but it will be a matter to see if this promise will be applicable to private schools also
 congress ne bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan band kiye gaye 2 xxrep 4 0 skulon ko phir se kholane or ambedkar lau uniwarsity or haridev joshi patrakarita vishvavidhyalay ko phir se shuru karne kaa vaayada bhi kiya he
 Overall, policy changes will not be seen on a large scale if the government changes
 lekin kisaanon kii karjamaafee raahat bhari khabar hogi
 So at the same time, if the Gehlot government is able to regularize the tender workers, it will be a big achievement
 swasthya ke kshetra main gahalot kii muft dawa yojana ko kaaphi saraahaa gaya tha, jiskaa vasundhara raaje sarkaar ne bhamashah card ke taur par vistaar hi kiya, lekin unki tasviir ke saath yah card prachaar kaa jariya bhi bana

 Ajit had earlier denied that he had anything to do with AG Mercantile
 lekin jab unhen vah dastavej dikhaaya jisase saaf tha ki is company ke 8,800 equity share unke paas hai to unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 Pawar's family friend and Vinod Goenka, co-owner of DB Realty involved in the 2G scam, are among the directors of the company
 ajit ne kaha kiunhone november, 2005 main apane share bech die the isliye unhone apane chunavi halafname main unka zikr nahin kiya
 But it is evident from the record that even after 2005 he remained a part of the company

 Jia lived with her mother and sister in the house, but at that time there was no one in the house
 kisi ne kabhi kaha tha ki kaho ki lab azaad hai
 But today you have to say that scream
 
 
 ki ham khamosh hai
 An eight-year-old girl is raped by eight people for a week
 yahaan tak ki aakhir main jab us bacchee kaa katl karne ja rahe the, tab ek police afasar unase kahata he ki kuch der or ruk jaao main bhi ise noch-khasot luun phir maar dena
 It has been two months for this incident, but till now we are all silent
 udhar, bina soche bina dekhe upi police bas encounter par encounter kiye ja rahi he
 But in the same UP, there is a charge of Parbalkatarka, an MLA
 shikaayat karne par peedit kaa pita thane main maaraa jaataa he
 Everyone hears the screams of the victim and his family, but still we are silent
 kya kiijie ham or aap to vaise bhi hameshaa khamosh hi rahete hai
 The remaining leaders and the government have all gone on a silent fast under the pretext of fasting
 bacchee se haivaaniyat, MLA kii dabangaidesh main teen badi khabaren hai
 The leaders and the government sitting on a day-long fast
 duusari insaaniyat ko sharmasaar kar dene vaale haivaanon or unke haathon marane se pehle aakhri ghadi tak nonchi-khasoti gai aath saal kii maasoom bacchee kii
 And the news of the third Unnao's domineering MLA who takes the charge of rape on the head and travels all over Lucknow and the government is seen bowing before him
 haivaaniyat par sarkaar kaa maunvratsachamuch aajki raajnneeti ko upwas kii hi zarurat he
 If fasting, the stomach will be empty
 khaali pet bol vachan kam hi nikalate hai
 Our leaders are smart and the government is one and a half smart
 tabhi to upwas ke bahaane sabake sab maun vrath par chale gaye hai
 There is no saying that the eight-year-old girl from Kathua has been the victim of the lust of the Havans and that the Havans have no religion or religion
 isliye is haivaaniyat ko dharm ke chashme se nahin balki sirf or sirf kanoon ke chashme se dekhen
 There is silence in the name of fasting, so the leaders and the government are not even talking about what should be done with the MLA of Unnao who is accused of rape
 chargeshit main khulaasa- mandir main hota rahaa bacchee se repagussa nahin hairaani hoti he, logon kii us soch par jo ruh ko chalni kar dein vaali gang rape jaisi vaardaat main bhi dharm or mazahab dhund lete hai
 People say leave the rapists of the girl who lost her lust in a temple in Kathua
 dil par haath rakh kar kahiega
 Even if you leave such people in the name of religion, will the people of their own religion or their close relatives dare to leave a child of their own house alone with them? Before you answer, it is important to hear the story of that girl once
 or ye kahani sirf kahani nahin he balki kathua kii zila adaalat main darj chargeshit kaa hissaa he
 That is, it is a legal document
 mandir ke sevadaar sanjiram kii khaufnak sajeeshkathua ke gaanv rasana ke aasapaas haal ke vakt main alpsankhyak bakarwaal samudaay ke kuch parivaar aakar bas gaye the
 Sanji Ram, the servant of the Devisthan Temple of this village, wanted to remove the people of this community from the village
 usee ne ye puri saazish rachi
 Sanji Ram, who retired as the revenue officer, saw an 8-year-old girl from the neighborhood go to the forest to feed cattle daily
 isi ke baad uske man main us bacchee ko lekar paap jaagaa
 That Havan also included his minor nephew in this sin
 bacchee ko peetate rahe, rape karte rahe, nasha dete rahe10 janvari 2018 kii baat he
 The nephew breaks into the forest on the girl searching for the animals
 use jangal ke hi ek mandir main lekar pahunchataa he
 According to the chargesheet filed in the court, he rapes the girl in the prayer room of the temple
 phir wo apane dost mannu ko bhi bula letaa he
 Both rape again
 iske baad wo apane chachaa ko isaki khabar detaa he
 Sanji Ram fetches the drug of unconsciousness and reaches the temple
 donon bacchee ko peetate, rape karte, peetate, rape karte peetate or phir rape karte
 Many times he kept raping even in the state of unconsciousness
 rape karne ke liye meerut se bulaayaa dost12 janvari ko bacchee kaa pita hiranagar thane pahunchataa he ki sahab teen din se hamaari beti ghar nahin ai
 Special police officer Deepak Khajuria is pressed into the investigation
 uske saath team main eesai pravesh kumaar, surinder kumaar or head consteble tilak raaj bhi shaamil the
 Meanwhile, Sanji's nephew calls his friend Vishal Jangotra from Meerut and says that if he wants to rape an eight-year-old girl, he should immediately come to Kathua
 chargeshit ke mutabik vishaal agali hi train se kathua pahunchataa he or behosh bacchee se rape karata he
 Policemen also became Havan, according to the report of the officer before the murder, till then, the investigating officer Deepak Khajuria reaches the temple locating the girl
 lekin wo sabko turant giraftaar karne kii bajaay bhattije ke parivaar ko blackmel karne lagata he
 It is written in the charge sheet that he also charges one and a half lakh rupees for saving the boy
 iske baad jab wo mandir pahunchataa he, to bacchee behosh padi hoti he
 Sanjiram says that now he has to be killed
 is par jaanch adhikari khajuriya kahata he ki thodi der ruk jaao
 i can also do something
 iske baad wo police adhikari bhi us bacchee se rape karata he
 Then everyone again gang-rapes the innocent eight-year-old
 galaa ghontkar hatya, pathar se kuchlaa tha siriske baad usee haalat main us bacchee kaa galaa ghont kar use maar dete hai
 Then his head is crushed with stone
 or laash jangal main phenk diya jaataa he
 So much pain with the innocent that someone's heart may be shaken
 chargeshit ke tahat sanji ram, uskaa betaa vishaal, sab inspector anand datta, do vishesh police adhikari deepak khajuriya or surendra verma, head consteble tilak raaj or sthaneey nivasee pravesh kumaar par rape, murder or saboot mitaane ke maamle darj kiye gaye hai
 Are we not ashamed in the name of being human? This is the whole story of Kathua
 ab aap jawaab dijie
 What are you thinking man baari he? vaazib he
 But we live in this world
 naaj karte hai apni sabhyataa par
 We do not get tired to say that we taught the world the wisdom of the world and where have we reached now? What if justice is done? What will be the punishment for the man who has died inside millions of people like you while listening to this story? Hopefully
 
 
 taziraat-e-hind kii dfaaon main mari hui insaaniyat kaa bhi koi maraham hota
 There would be someone who grinded and tied such a herb that would save our children from evil eyes
 aadam kii aulaaden itani buree to na thim kabhi ki hamen shame aati khud ko aadmi kehane par
 Such a statement in support of the MLA accused of gang rape! Kathua or Unnao
 kisko dikhaaen apana ghaav
 Because in support of Unnao's rape MLA Sengar, an MLA from Bareilly's Bauria MLA gives a strange statement
 vidhayak surendar singh kehete hai ki main nahin maanata kii senger ne balaatkaar kiya hoga
 Because how can anyone rape a mother of three children
 ek aisa bayaan jise surendar singh ke ghar kii mahilaayein bhi sunanaa nahin pasand karengi
 Leave aside the talk of the women of the country
 jati, dharm ke naam par kyon dete hai vot?darasal, ye bayaan surendar singh or senger jaise vidhayakon kii ghatiya maansikta dikhaata he
 What status can any woman hold for them? lekin kya fark padataa he agar ye aisa kah rahe hai? lekin kya isamen sirf sanji ram, senger, surendar, vishaal, senger yaa khajuriya jaise log hi doshi hai? kya ham nahin hai iske jimmedaar jo jhooth ke kaarobaar main apana munafa dekhte hai? logon ke chaal or charitra ko jaanate hue bhi apana vot kisi khaas makasad yaa kisi khaas faayde ke liye aise logon kii jholii main daal dete hai
 And in return they keep us away from education
 hamaare adhikaron se hamen dur rakhte hai
 Confuse us in the quarrels of religion and caste
 jab bacchee ko skool chhodane jaaenge, dil dhadakegaaiye kathua or unnav kii ghatana ko lekar jor jor se chikhen
 Curse the power netaaon ko galiyaan den
 And try to show that at home and in the society, see how much humanity we have
 lekin subah jab apni bacchiyon ko skool bas stop tak chhodane jaayenge to dil to dhadkegaa
 Believe in humanity, we pray that what happened to the families of Kathua and Unnao should not happen to us and your families
 lekin agar sirf dua kaaphi nahin he to phir hamen or aapako sochna hi padegaa
 What is the treatment for it
 jitani jaldi ho sake hamen yah faisla karnaa hi padegaa ki hamaari bechainiyon kaa ilaaj hamen hi dhundhna he
 Any government
 koi netaa
 No system can give us our authority and for this with religion
 
 
 jati kii siyasat se
 
 upar uthakar maanavtaa kii ekta main vishwaas karnaa padegaa
 Together the poor people like Sanji Ram and Sanger, the answer may be that the incident of Kathua and Unnao till yesterday was only the incident of Kathua and Unnao
 lekin
 
 
 Today it is an event in every city and every house
 kathua kii bacchee sabhi kii bacchee he
 The woman of Unnao also has the same blood, which is in the body of our women
 vah pita jo kathua ke jangalon main bhatak rahaa tha yaa lakhanu ke hukmaranon se apni beti ke liye nyaay maang rahaa tha kya us pita ke badan se rishte khun main aapako apana khun nahin nazar aata?
 If that blood is yours then we assure that Ainda will not have the courage of any Sanger, any Sanji Ram, who can also look at the sisters and daughters

 On the first ball of one of the fastest bowlers in the world, Mitchell Johnson, he hit a great straight drive and repeated his shot on the second ball in the best way
 pehle donon gendon par chaukaa khaane ke baad johnson ne gendon patakana shuru kiya or agali do gendon ko short of length phenkaa
 But where was Dilshan to stop
 unhone do karaare pul shot maare or chaar gendon par chaa chauke lag gaye
 The fifth ball of the over was taken by Mitchell Johnson outside the off stump and Dilshan hit a Bahrain cover drive
 aakhri gend johnson ne dhimi phenki lekin us samay tak dilashan itani lay main aa chuke the ki unka ek halkaa sa push bhi gend ko boundary line se baahar le gaya
 Dilshan had hit 6 fours off Johnson's 6 balls
 vanade main ek over main sabase zyaada ran kaa record harchel gibs ke naam he jab unhone 2006 / 07 main nederlands ke gendbaaz vine banj ko 6 gendon par 6 chakke maare the
 Tej Bahadur (tejbahadur), a sacked BSF soldier, has been in the limelight for some reason or the other ever since Varanasi came to contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 haalanki jab ve nirdaleey prachaar kar rahe the tab apane note or vot ke tareeke se logon kaa dhyaan khinch rahe the or vivaadon main bhi nahin the lekin jaise hi samaajawaadee party (samajwadi Party) ne unke kandhe par haath rakhaa vaise hi ve ek ke baad ek museebaton main ghirte ja rahe hai
 First the controversy over his nomination, then the controversy of his rejection, then another fresh controversy after he announced the promotion of the SP candidate
 ab do saal purana sharaab pite hue unka visual aayaa he jisase unki chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In this old video which has become the subject of fresh controversy, it is being said that in 50 crores, PM can be eliminated
 viral ho rahe is video ke saamne aane ke baad bijepi (BJP) ke log bhi iskaa jawaab dene ke liye saamne aa gaye bijepi ke jiviel narsimha raav ne twit kar is par apni coment kiya
 GVL Narasimha Rao, BJP: Stunned by statements of SP candidate, Tej Bahadur Yadav
 He was drafted by SP from Varanasi,his candidature has been nullified for various reasons
 We can see on TV how he's telling a group that he's willing to hatch a plot to assassinate PM Modi for Rs50 cr pic
 twitter
 com / kmvemg9hpd Tejbahadur also did not back down
 varanasi main sapa ke prachaar ke dauraan jab patrakaron ne unase is par sidhaa sawaal kiya to unhone kaha ki "unase puuchhie ki koun de rahaa he do karod rupee
 All this is rubbish
 jhooth, afvaah failaai ja rahi he
 These are blackmailers
 maine subah naam bhi bataaya tha aapako or kaha tha ki dekhnaa kis-kis tarah ke video nikaalkar laaenge ye log
 You must have seen the video
 isaki jaanch karaaen or agar galat he to daal de hamen jail main, main taiyaar hum
 Why is Modi ji scared of a young man
 ham supreme court gaye to unako laga ki shaayad yahaan kaa chunaav radd hi na ho jaae
 So such videos will keep coming, we do not care
 "apane nae viral hue video kaa jawaab dete tej bahadur tej bahadur kah rahe hai ki yah farji video he or agar yah sahi he to isaki jaanch karakar modi ji jail main daal den suniye kya kah rahe hai tej bahadur apane nae viral video ko lekar pic
 twitter
 com / 8gikod4rgfwejabahaxura ke vivaadit video se kisko phayda ho rahaa he? kya tej bahadur isamen ghir rahe hai? yaa yah khud tej bahadur ko bada banane main sahaayak ho rahaa he? kya tej bahadur khud ise modi ke khilaaf hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kar rahe hai? in sab sawaalon ke jawaab sapa kii nai chaal se dekhnaa chahie
 The BJP seems to have been somewhat uneasy with the trumpet move done by Samajwadi Party regarding Tej Bahadur
 or agar nahin bhi hui he to is tarah ke har vivaad main sapa or tejbahadur bijepi ke saath sidhe narendra modi kaa naam khinchakar unhen asahaj banane kii koshish kar rahe hai taaki unki ladaai sidhe modi se hoti nazar aae
 The sacked soldier of BSF is becoming the right weapon in this because BJP and Modi have linked this election to the army with nationalism
 lihaaja jab ek sena kaa hi sipaahi sidhe atake kar rahaa he to uski maarak kshamta tej nazar aa rahi he
 The new controversial video of BSF sacked soldier Tej Bahadur, who is probably 2 years old, is once again viral and in the headlines pic
 twitter
 com / ljrovbraao Tej Bahadur also seems to find this type of controversy more favorable to him as neither the media nor the BJP was giving him any consideration when he was roaming around with his few associates by nominating independents here
 lekin sapa main aane ke baad ve ratorat star ban gaye
 His news started trending from Twitter to everywhere
 media ke bade-bade logon kaa jamaavada lagane laga
 With this, his fight started directly with the most powerful person in the country, so Teja Bahadur has more advantage in it
 isliye ve har ladaai ko badi karne ke liye chunauti de rahe hai or vah bhi sidhe pradhanmantri ko
 With opener Brandon mccullum scoring his first double century of his career, New Zealand were relegated to a safe place on Tuesday and also dented India's hopes of winning their second Test cricket match
 match aakhir main dra samaapt hua jisase teen match kii shrinkhalaa ab bhi 0-0 se baraabar he
 mccullum played a fine innings of 225 runs as New Zealand declared their second innings ending at 448 for eight at tea
 harbhajan singh ke karishmai shatak se pehali pari main 122 ran kii badhat banane vaale bharat ko is tarah se 30 over main jeet ke liye 327 ran kaa asambhav lakshya mila lekin jab usne 17 over main virendra sahvaag (naabad 54) ke ardhashatak se bina kisi nuksaan ke 68 ran banaaye the tab donon captain match dra samaapt karne par sahamat ho gayi
 The result of the first match played in Ahmedabad of the three-match series could not be achieved and now the number-one ranked India in the ICC rankings to win the series in Nagpur in the third and final Test cricket match starting on November 20
 Must win maikulam paanchaven or antim din ke nayak rahe
 His efforts did not give the Indian bowlers any success in the first season
 duusare satr main chaar wicket gire lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 mccullum added 124 runs for the fifth wicket with Kane Williamson (69) and 51 runs with captain Daniel Vettori (23) after adding 125 runs for the first wicket with Tim Mackintos on the fourth day
 maikulam haalanki match ke nayak rahe or unhen main aaf da match bhi chunaa gaya
 Luck was also with him as he was given life by Substitute fielder Cheteshwar Pujara when he was at 148
 unhone apni pari main 308 gend kheli tathaa 22 chauke or chaar chakke lagaaye
 India failed to get wickets in the first session, India took four wickets in the second session but their bowlers failed to stop the run flow of New Zealand which added 109 runs between lunch and tea break
 es srisanth ne maikulam sahit do khilaadiyon ko pavilion bheja jabaki harbhajan singh ne williamson or suresh raina ne vittori ko out kiya lekin tab tak bahut der ho chuki thi
 When New Zealand started the game at 237 for four wickets, mccullum and Williamson showed vigilance when needed, in addition to aggressive temper
 in donon ne pehle satr main 102 ran jode or is bich kiwi team ko koi jhatka nahin lagane diya
 Turns start on the Indian pitches from the fourth day itself, but the Uppal Stadium, which is organizing the test for the first time, did not see the turn on the fifth day
 bharat ko jeet ke liye shuru main hi kam se kam do wicket kii darkaar thi lekin maikulam or williamson ke aage uske gendbaajon kii ek nahin chali
 Williamson had expressed his intentions by hitting three fours in the first over of the day
 iske baad unhone jahir khan kii gend bhi seemaa rekha paar bheji
 mccullum kept Harbhajan on target just like on the fourth day and made good use of the reverse sweep against him
 unhone raina kii gend par pedal schoop se chaukaa jadkar apana pehla doharaa shatak puraa kiya
 mccullum's concentration was finally dissolved on a slow ball like Sreesanth's leg break
 vah is gend ko seemaa rekha paar bhejnaa chaahate the lekin gachha kha gayi or gend hawa main laharaati hui mid aan par raina ke surakshit haathon main samaa gayi
 Harbhajan lbw to Williamson earlier, but replays showed that the ball was going out of the leg stump
 raina ne vittori ko rahul dravid ke haathon kaich karakar bharat ko duusari safalataa dilaayi jabaki tim southi ke rup main teesraa wicket lekar srisanth bharat ke sabase safal gendbaaj rahe

 hamaare pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru kii jayanti ke avasar par aaj puraa desh unhen shradhanjali de rahaa he
 Today is 130th birth anniversary of Pandit Nehru, programs are being organized in many parts of the country on this occasion
 pandit nehru ke yogadan ko desh-duniya bhul nahin paati, lekin iske saath hi unke bare main kai tarah ke myth, kai tarah kii galat dharanaen bhi prachlit hai
 Today, on the occasion of his birth anniversary, we are trying to know the truth of some such assumptions
 1
 Subhash Chandra Bose is not respected
 a myth about Kianeharu is propagated that he was opposed to Subhash Chandra Bose and did not respect him
 yah sach he ki gandhi or nehru kaa subhash chandra bose se tikhaa vaicharik matbhed tha, lekin yah kahin se bhi manabhed nahin tha or donon netaa ek-duusare kaa sammaan karte the
 On the contrary, after the death of Subhash Chandra Bose, Nehru sent a regular pension to Netaji's daughter
 yahi nahin, parivaar kii niztaa or netaji kaa sammaan karte hue aarthik madad kii baat ko gupt rakhaa gaya
 Nehru stood up against his father for Subhash Chandra Bose
 asal main congress ke kalakatta adhiveshan main motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main gandhi ji ke samarthan se ek ‘dominian stats’ kaa prastaav aayaa tha, lekin subhash chandra bose ne is prastaav ke khilaaf sanshodhan pesh kiya ki bharat ko sampurna aazaadee se kam kuch nahin chahie
 Pandit Nehru strongly supported this amendment against Gandhi and Motilal Nehru
 yahi nahin, jis subhash se nehru kaa tikhaa vaicharik matbhed tha, unheen ke naare ‘jaihind’ ko nehru ne desh kaa naaraa bana diya
 On 15 August, Nehru began speaking 'jaihind' in an address from the Red Fort
 subhash chandra bose kii maut ke baad aaazaad hind fouj(iene) ke hajaaron sainikon-adhikariyon ko britain kii kaid se nikaalane or unhen court marshall se bachaane ke liye ke liye nehru ne ‘iene dephence kamity’ banaai
 He himself became the advocate of these soldiers and advocated them wearing a black robe
 ye bhi padhein: kabhi 20 november ko manaaya jaataa tha bal diwas, phir aise tay hui 14 taarikh2
 The myth about Nehru not going to meet Bhagat Singh in jail is also prevalent that Nehru never went to meet him when revolutionary Sardar Bhagat Singh was imprisoned and was hanged
 yah baat galat he
 Nehru was among the top leaders of the country who went to jail and met Bhagat Singh and his companions
 nehru ne bhagat singh ke hinsa ke raste kii kabhi tarif nahin kii, lekin unki bahaduree or deshprem kii saarvajanik rup se prashansa kii
 Apart from Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh was the only person whom Nehru appreciated the most
 8 agast 1929 ko jawahar laal nehru ne jail main band bhagat singh or unke saathiyon se mulaakaat kii or 9 agast ko unhone lahore main vaktavy diya
 2
 sardaar patel or nehru main nahin patati thimeh sach he ki pandit nehru or patel ke bich kai masalon par tikhe vaicharik matbhed rahe hai, lekin yahaan bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yah manabhed nahin tha
 There were some ideological differences between the two on economic issues and communalism
 kai baar donon ke bich aise tikhe vaicharik matbhed hue ki donon istipha dene tak ko taiyaar ho gaye
 But both continued to work together for nation building
 nehru ke maargdarshan main hi sardaar patel ne desh kii 500 se bhi zyada riyasaton ke ekikaran or vilay kaa anoothaa kaary puraa kiya
 After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel decided to resign on moral grounds
 iske baad nehru ne unhen patr likhaa: ‘jab baapu jivit the tab hamane saath-saath baapu se milane or unase un baton kii charchaa karne kii aashaa rakhi thi, jinhone hamen kuch had tak pareshaan kar rakhaa tha
 In my last letter, i had hoped that despite some differences of opinion and temperament, we should keep working together, as we have done for so long
 yah jaanakar mujhe anand hota he ki baapu kii antim raay bhi yahi thi
 '4
 angreji bhashaa- culture ko badhaava diya, sanskrit ke virodhipandit nehru landan main padhe the, lekin apni maati se puri tarah se jude the
 People often make assumptions about him that he promoted English language and culture in the country
 lekin sach to yah he ki vah maatrubhaasha, sanskrit or swadeshi-khaadi ko badhaava dene ke samarthak the
 After independence, the issue of language in the country heats up
 tab nehru ne 6 disambar, 1948 ko sabhi rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ko patr likhaa, ‘bhashaa kaa sawaal bahut tark-vitark kaa vishay ban gaya he
 i think the basic policy of the state should be that the basic education of the child is in his mother tongue, so many children will benefit from it
 ’sanskrit ke bare main nehru ne likhaa tha, ‘mujhe sanskrit bahut zyada nahin aati, phir bhi main sanskrit kaa bada mureed hum
 i hope that Sanskrit will be read aloud in time to come
 ’5
 Article 370 came into force only because of Nehru
 There remained a belief that Article 370 came into force only because of Pandit Nehru and Sardar Patel was opposed to it
 lekin yah baat bhi sach nahin he
 The truth is that Sardar Patel said that Article 370 was necessary for Kashmir
 jab samvidhan sabha main anuchhed 370 par bahes ho rahi thi, to us samay nehru desh se baahar the or sardaar patel ne is par chale bahes kii jaankaree nehru ko di thi
 Sardar Patel himself had argued during the debate in the Constituent Assembly that Article 370 is necessary for the special problems of Kashmir
 jawahar laal nehru ne 25 july 1952 ko mukhyamantriyon ko likhe apane ek patr main kaha tha, 'jab november 1949 main ham bharat ke samvidhan ko antim rup de rahe the, tab sardaar patel ne is maamle ko dekha
 Then he gave Jammu and Kashmir a special but transitional status in our constitution
 is darje ko samvidhan main anuchhed 370 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Apart from this, on 26 January 1950, it was also entered through a presidential order
 is anuchhed ke madhyam se or is aadesh ke madhyam se hamaare samvidhan ke kuch hi hisse kashmir par lagu hote hai

 rangeen mijaaji ke aropanehru ko badnaam karne ke liye soshal media par khub raita failaayaa gaya he
 All photos are released about him and he is called ayyash
 asal main yah cultural gap kii vajah se bhi hota he
 It was common for women to get up - sit, hug, smoke, cigarettes in the creamy layer or affluent family that Nehru came from, but there is a large section that does not have such exposure and has a different culture
 aise log nehru ko ayyash sabit kar dete hai
 Not only this, many times a photo is misreported or photoshopped
 jaise nehru kii ek jawan ladki ke saath gale milte hue photo share kii jaati he, jabaki yah tasviir kisi angrej mahila kii nahin balki ek bhartiya mahila kii hi he
 This Indian woman is none other than Nayantara Sehgal, nephew of Nehru
 nayantara sahagal jawahar laal nehru kii bahan vijayalakshmi pandit kii duusari beti hai

 vanshavaad ko badhaava dianeharu ke bare main ek dharna yah prachaarit kii jaati he ki unhone vanshavaad ko badhaava diya
 The reason for this is that his daughter Indira became the Prime Minister of India and after that his 'gandhi family' ruled the country for a long time
 sach yah he ki nehru yah nahin chaahate the ki unki beti indira gandhi pradhanmantri bane
 If anyone has taken the Gandhi family forward in politics, it is Indira and not Nehru
 vaise bhi indira gandhi ko nehru kii maut ke baad tatkaal pradhanmantri nahin banaaya gaya tha, balki tab laal bahadur shastri desh ke pradhanmantri bane the
 Yes, it is certainly true that Indira Gandhi was active in the freedom struggle and later Congress politics, due to which she made a place for herself

 The most emphatic notion about Nehru was that he was not a worthy successor to Gandhi and that he was not a worthy successor to Gandhi and was a better Patel than who should have become India's first PM
 lekin sach yah he ki nehru kii yogyata ko sardaar patel ne bhi sweekaar kii thi or unhone nehru ke netritv main kaam karnaa sweekaar kiya tha
 Gandhi made Pandit Nehru the first PM of the country because his acceptance was to every area and every section of the country
 unke baaki vikalp jaise sardaar patel, rajendra prasad, moulana aaazaad aadi kuch virgon or ilaakon tak janaadhar rakhane vaale netaa the
 He became the undisputed leader of the Congress after Gandhi
 nehru desh ke jan netaa the (photo: Getty Images))9
 There was a dictatorial view
 There is also a myth about Nehru that he used to act in a dictatorial manner
 is dharna ke banane kii ek vajah yah bhi ho sakati he ki nehru kaa koi bahut kareebi mitra nahin ban paaya or wo apana koi uttaradhikari bhi nahin khadaa kar paae
 But the truth is that he did a lot of work to raise democratic values in the country
 ve abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke prabal samarthak the
 Not only this, in the Cabinet which was formed after independence, Pandit Nehru considered himself not the biggest but the first among the equal people
 ve to is maamle main yahaan tak loktantric the ki unhen ek baar sardaar patel ne samajhaayaa ki ve pradhanmantri hai or baaki cabinet mantriyon ke kaam main dakhal de sakate hai

 apane aarthik model se desh ko barbaad kiyaneharu ke aarthik model ko bhi desh kii kathith ‘barbaadi’ kii ek vajah mana jaataa he
 His economic policy was actually an amalgam of communism and capitalism, also called Nehruvian socialism
 yah thik he ki aaj unki nitiyaan kuch ajeebogareeb lagati hai, lekin aaj ke 70 saal pehle ke bharat ke liye aisi niti jaruri thi, jisko angrej puri tarah se chus kar gaye the or jahaan khaane kaa anaaj tak aayaat karnaa padataa tha
 Severe capitalism could not be implemented in a poor country
 lokkalyaan jaruri tha or udyogon kaa sangrakshan bhi
 That is why Nehru set up big government companies ie psus which were involved in the production of bread to steel
 desh main bijli, pani, sadak, khanan jaise sabhi sector main baari puunji lagane kii jarurat thi or tab nijee kshetra itnaa viksit nahin tha ki use yah kaam saunpa ja sake

 Bollywood's famous music composer Aadesh Srivastava succumbed to cancer a few months ago
 haalat gambhir hone par unhen kokilaben dhirubhai ambani aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya
 It is reported that the orders have been filed there for the last several weeks and their condition is more fragile than before

 aaj vaardaat main baat us raaj kii jisamen ankhe kholana manaa he, kyonki janmashtami kii raat ek khaas ilaake main jo kuch hota he
 No one is allowed to see him
 ye silsilaa sadiyon purana he
 But nobody has been able to witness this secret of the night till date
 aisa nahin he ki logon ne tahakikat karne kii koshish nahin kii
 Rather, whoever knows this secret is not able to tell this secret to others
 to aakhir kya he is raat kaa raazaaj insaan zamin par baithe baithe puraa brahmad dekh saktaa he
 But in the area we are talking about, a person cannot even see that special night
 kyonki yahaan koun kya kab dekh saktaa he ye insaan nahin bhagwaan tay karte hai
 And that's why people going to this area keep blowing their feet, night and night
 kehete hai is raat yahaan bhagwaan shrikrishna apni radha ke sang maharas rachaate hai
 No human is allowed to see
 nidhivan main yah parampara sadiyon puraani hai
 Which is still maintained today
 is rahasy ko aaj tak koi nahin jaan paaya
 The human mind can still be tricked
 use majaboor kiya ja saktaa he kisi daastaan par yakeen karne ke liye
 But no one can walk on animals
 wo bhi vahi karte hai jo unhen karnaa hota he
 Still say miracles or some divine leela that all the animals of this area change their hideout in the evening
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki iskaa jawaab kisi ke paas nahin he
 Several issues were discussed on the third day of Sahitya Aaj Tak 2018
 yahaan hallaa bol manch par 'hindi main kya bikta he' satr ke dauraan ye jaanane kii koshish kii aakhir hindi ke pathak ko kya chahie
 Aditi Maheshwari, and Bhagwant became precious in this session
 vaani prakaashan kii pramukh aditi maheshwari ne kaha ki hindi desh kaa sabase bada bazaar he, isamen sabakuch bikta he
 Whoever writes in Hindi will be sold and will sell only those who write well
 unhone kaha ki prakaashak ek dashanan hota he, uske bhi kai chehre or vichaar hote hai, jise bahut kuch dekhnaa hota he
 The editorial board of the publisher is also important, they have the experience of the book and content
 kitaab ko maanjhne ke liye ye board jaruri hota he
 Sahitya Aaj Tak LIVE coverage Aditi said that social media has caused discomfort among the people
 ab log turant rigelt chaahate hai, jo lekhakon ke liye nuksaandeh hota he
 a lot of research is needed before writing, for that one has to come out of facebook-twitter and come in books
 yuva lekhak bhagwant anmol ne kaha ki kuch samay pehle tak ye mana jaataa he ki lekhak vahi hota he jiske safed dadhi hoti he, pichley paanch saal main chijen badali hai ki ab kaali dadhi vaala bhi lekhak mana janaa jaataa he
 He said that when i was 21 years old, when the first book was published, no publisher considered me an author
 unhone kaha ki lekhan se roji-roti nahin chal sakati he, lekhan se utana paisa miltaa he jitna diwali par bonus miltaa he

 -input IANS Anurag Kashyap turned 44 on September 10
 bollywood main unhen ek alag hatakar filmkaar ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Gorakhpur-born Anurag made a different world of Hindi cinema from the films he made
 darshakon kaa ek tabaka unki in filmon kaa aisa divaana hua ki phir anuraag kii har aane vaali film kaa intjaar hone laga
 Perhaps the reason behind this is that Anuragasinema is not just an art, but a religion

 Films like 0 (2016)
 magar anuraag kii filmon kii sabase khaas baat thi unke dialogs
 Anurag's films broke the myth in which it is believed that applause and whistles are made in the hall only when the hero does action
 anuraag ne aisi filmein banaain, jinke dialogs par hi theatre taaliyon se gunj uthta he, log seat se khadey ho jate hai
 On his birthday, he remembers similar dialogues of his films - Son Tum Tum Na Ho Paagga - Gangs of Wasseypur-2 Tigmanshu Dhulia The way these dialogues are spoken, copying it is a bit difficult
 lekin phir bhi logon kii jindagi kaa hissaa ban gaya he ye dialog
 By the way, there was a lot of controversy about this film
 kaha gaya tha ki is film main hinsa ke drishyon ko kaaphi badha-chadhaakar dikhaaya gaya he, lekin phir bhi film ko khub saraahaa gaya
 Its dialogues were then super-duper hits
 dilli main billi maar lo, kha lo, lekin paalo nahin-dev didev di ke is dialog ko abhaya deol ne jab bolaa, to phir dilli ke har yuva kii jubaan par chadh gaya ye dialog
 Ninezuddin Siddiqui said this dialog in such a way that the name of Faizal became popular from house to house
 manaa thodi he, lekin parmishan to leni chahie naa-gangs of vasepur-1huma kuraishi kaa bolaa gaya ye dialog to jaise ladakiyon kaa fevorett hi ban gaya he
 One year is enough for a manager to become papalu
 blike friddgar bhul gaye hai, to aapako ek baar phir ke

 -satyamanoj Vajpayee's acting is no match
 lekin is simple se dialog main jaise unhone jaan daali, wo jarur kaabile-gaur he
 i am in hell, but i know the way to heaven - the dialogues of Talaamir Khan's film Talaash were also written by Anurag Kashyap
 ye dialog karina kapur ne bolaa tha or bakhubi bolaa tha

 rajasthan main bhartiya janata party kaa pradesh adhyaksh koun hoga, is baat par party ke andar hi bavaal machaa hua he
 It is to be noted that there are assembly elections in Rajasthan in november-december this year and since last 16 April, there is no one to take charge of the party in Rajasthan BJP
 shuukravaar ko vasundhara raaje or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii mulaakaat ke baad raaje mantrimandal ke sipahasaalar or bijepi ke vasundhara samarthak vidhayak waapas jaipur laut aae hai, lekin abhi tak saaf nahin ho paaya he ki party kaa aglaa pradesh adhyaksh koun hoga
 While leaving from BJP headquarters in Delhi, Vasundhara Raje told the reporters that 'you can see happiness on my face'
 vasundhara ke is baat ko lekar rajasthan main tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Here, the way the bjp's central leadership is not able to announce the name despite the Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat's name for the state president, it seems that Vasundhara Raje is heavy on the bjp's central leadership this time
 Has fallen
 yah pehla mauka he jab bijepi alaakaman khud ke faisle ko lagu karaane main naakaam rahaa he
 Vasundhara Raje has challenged in such a way that if it is implemented, the bjp's loot in the assembly elections in Rajasthan can be drowned

 It is being said that Gajendra Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah can no longer decide that Gajendra Singh Shekhawat should not be made the state president
 is maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi se charchaa ke baad hi kuch sambhav he, isliye yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki ho saktaa he, karnataka chunaav tak rajasthan main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh kaa pad khaali rahe
 People also say that when the names were not finalized, what was the need to remove the President President Ashok Parnami present on April 16
 vasundhara samarthakon ko is tarah se jaldbaaji main pradesh adhyaksh kaa hataaya janaa pasand nahin aayaa

 How did you impose such a big step on the people of the country without thinking? We are strongly opposed to black money
 lekin iske naam par aap puunjipatiyon kii god main baithkar aam logon ko pareshaan nahin kar sakate
 Why is the Prime Minister hesitating to catch those who really have black money? a person whose decision depends on the lives of crores of people, does he have the right to take decisions without any impulse, in a fit of rage, on the front pages? Modi ji has some questions from you, the public wants answers
 1
 Today, the farmer of the country is doing trihimam
 uski donon fasalein barbaad hone ke kagaar par he
 What did the farmers do to you? What is being avenged from the farmers? The country's farmer is poor, but not weak
 desh kaa kisaan modi ko maaf nahin karegaa

 desh ke bhukhe, nirdhan, vanchit ko sataane main pradhanmantri ko koun sa naiysargik sukh praapt ho rahaa he? tumne jo hangaamaa khadaa kiya he, uske shor sharabe main karodon logon ke bhukh or pidaa se karaahne kii aawaaj dab rahi he, par samaj lo hameshaa nahin dabegi

 pradhanmantri bataae ki notebandi ke baad FDI kaa kitna billian dollar desh ke baahar ja chukaa he? is kadam se bhartiya arthvyavastha main avyavashtha kii chhavi vaala jo nakaaratmak sandesh puure vishwa main gaya he, usase ubar paane main kitne pragatisheel saalon kii bali chadhegi?4
 The Prime Minister should tell who is responsible for rupee weakness and worse situation? 5
 pradhanmantri bataae ki is kadam se GDP growth rate jo gote khaaegi, uski bharpai main kitne varsh lagenge? vikaas dar main giravat kii zimmevary pradhanmantri legaa yaa bali kaa bakra dhundha jayega?6
 So far more than 75 people have died due to demonetisation
 inaki hatya kaa doshi koun he? PM bataae ki peedit pariwaron ko muawza diya jayega ki nahin?7
 The Prime Minister should tell who will compensate the loss to the small traders? Who will pay for the loss and inconvenience caused to the people of the unorganized sector? 8
 pradhanmantri ke is nirnay main kya cabinet kii sahmati thi? agar sachmuch thi, to is nirnay main koun koun log bhagidaar the, kyonki janata jaananaa chaahati he ki uski is durdasha ke liye koun-koun jimmedaar hai?9
 Is the RSS enjoying the suffering of the people? Is this the case of demonetisation on the orders of the Sangh? Why is Mohan Bhagwat silent? 10
 modi bataae ki abtak desh ko kitne manhours or production kaa nuksaan hua he? uski bharpai kaise hogi?11
 The Prime Minister should set the limit and according to his promise, when 15-15 lakh rupees will be deposited in the account of the people? 12
 kya pradhanmantri puri tarah aashwast he ki bache hue 35 din main wo sabhi samasyaon kaa nidaan kar denge? nahin to bataaven ki kitne din or janata ko tadapaayenge?13

 assi ke dashak vaali riganomics ke purodha or trical down theory ke pravartak aaj ke bharat main aa jaaen to unhen shaayad ek nai theory kii ijad kerani hogi jise trical ap theory kahenge
 The trickle down theory used to say that the demand can be increased by giving concessions to the upper section of the society i
e
 industry-business which will provide employment and earnings to the lower section
 lekin is siddhant ke purodhaon ko aaj ke bharat main yah sabit karne main katai dikkat nahin hogi ki kabhi-kabhi kisi desh kii iconomi main growth upar se neeche nahin balki neeche se upar chal detii he, jahaan ek vishaal arthvyavastha kii growth iske sabase bade hisson ko chhodkar mutthi bhar dhandhon main simat jaati he
 The Indian economy is now a three-speed economy, with fast growth remaining in the upper 30 per cent of the economy, where there are e-commerce, travel, stock markets, etc
 udyogon vaala doosraa 30 fisadi hissaa ikai kii growth main he or kheti, bhawan nirmaan aadi kaa teesraa hissaa to puri tarah nakaaratmak growth main he
 This scenario has been seen for the first time in the country
 jo ek jagah growth banaae rakhane, duusari jagah badhaane or teesri jagah growth waapas laane kii behad pechida chunauti lekar pesh hua he
 The budget of 2016 becomes very sensitive in light of this challenge
 teen alag-alag raftaaron vaali arthvyavastha ke is maahaul ko samajhnaa jaruri he kyonki is paridrishy par agle ek-do saal kii growth, nivesh or rojgaron kaa bada daaromadar he
 a recent study by Mumbai-based research firm Ambit Capital helps us understand the three-speed economy in depth
 yah adhyayan jidipi main yogadan karne vaale vibhinn hisson ke growth ke aankadon par aadhaarit he
 The first of the three fastest-growing sectors in the economy is that of transportation (especially aviation), hotels, commercial properties, e-commerce and business services
 do ankon kii gati se daud rahe is kshetra kaa jidipi main 30 fisadi hissaa he
 It may be noted that even though there is a slowdown in the building construction industry, commercial property is being sold
 thik isi tarah upabhokta vastuon ke bazaar main mandi ke baavjood i-commers main sakriyata he
 Investment in this fast-running economy through venture capital and PE funds
 iske alaava oonchi aay vaale niveshak bhi isamen sakriy hai
 There is no expectation of an early slowdown in this part
 The other part with moderate pace also has a share of 30 per cent in GDP
 ambit kaa adhyayan bataata he ki isamen vanijyik vaahan yani automobile, menufactoring, awasaiya bhawan nirmaan or khanan kshetra aate hai
 In this area, the growth of the unit is registering growth
 yahaan karj main dabi companiyaan balanceshit risesshan se jujh rahi hai, jisamen karj ke kaaran nayaa korporate nivesh nahin ho paata
 Therefore, there is a slight growth in some parts of the manufacturing sector
 jaise pichhali do timahiyon main bandargah parivahan or railway maal bhaade kii dhulaai main sthirataa he jabaki koyala va bijli main giravat darj kii gai he
 The third part with zero or negative growth is agriculture, overall building and infrastructure construction, administrative services and banking
 in sabakaa jidipi main hissaa 40 fisadi he
 The figures of government expenditure, demand and production of cement, steel etc
 and increase in income and employment prove that the condition is worst in these four areas

 thri speed iconomi ne gavarnence or nitigat str par do tarah kii asangatiyaan paidaa kii hai
 This has confused the government
 pichley do bajet isi asamanjas main biit gaye ki daudte ko or daudaya jaae, phir uske sahare mandi dur kii jaae yaa phir asli mandi se sidhe muthbhed kii jaae
 The second inconsistency is that there is a lot of gloom over the figures that tell the economy of the economy, due to brightness in 30% of GDP and sluggishness in 70%
 thri speed iconomi kii sabase vyaavhaarik mushkil yah he ki arthvyavastha ke jis 70 fisadi hisse main susti yaa gahari mandi chai he usamen kheti, bhawan nirmaan or menuphaccharing aate hai jo rojgaron kaa sabase bade strot hai
 The glow of just 30 per cent of the economy is giving strength to political debates like the 'suit-boot government' and pushing economic governance towards conservative subsidism which is a bigger problem
 is teen raftaar vaali arthvyavastha ke baad hamen jidipi ko kheti, udyog, seva kshetron main baantkar dekhnaa band karnaa chahie or un million iconomies ko dekhnaa hoga jo in teen bade hisson main bheetar chhipi hai or mandi, growth va rojgaar main nayak va pratinayak kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai
 The three speed economy is a strange kind of disability that needs subtle measures to handle
 yakeenan is tarah kii aarthik chunautiyon ke ilaaj ekamusth bajtiy rambaan main nahin balki chote-chote upayon main chhipe hai jo sarkaar se macro management chhodkar visheshgyon kii tarah kshetra vishesh ke ilaaj kii apeksha rakhte hai
 Arun Jaitley will be the first Finance Minister in recent history to face such complicated growth mathematics

 Of the inaccessible passes of the Himalayas
 unako fatah karne ke khyaal se nahin balki unako kareeb se dekhne ke khyaal se
 He wanted to see that Puranas, history, his school books
 bade boodhon kii kahaniyon kii vah duniya kisi he? asal main sach bataaun to ise padhate hue mujhe jane maane itihaaskaar shekhar pathak kii maansarovar yatra sansmaran kii yaad aati rahi
 Not because this story has some resemblance to it
 isliye ki usko padhate hue man vaise hi maansarovar kii yatra par jane kaa hone laga tha jaise ‘darra darra himalay’ padhate hue ek baar or himalay darshan kaa man hone laga
 And at least not right from Dalhousie or Manali
 yatra vrittant kaa ek gun yah bhi hota he
 The writer starts taking us with him in it
 vah khud bhi safar kaa saathi ban jaataa he or hamen bhi apana saathi banaata chalata he
 Sometimes like our guide, sometimes like a hitchhiker traveling along the journey telling an interesting story
 rahasy-romaanch se bharpoor
 i remember i had read Mohan Rakesh's travelogue during school days - till the rock
 na jane maine kitni baar dakshin bharat ke alag alag shaharon kii yatra kii, na jane kitna kuch badalte dekha
 i saw Bengaluru changing from a city of flowers to a city in Jam
 lekin aaj bhi dakshin main kahin jaataa hoon to mohan rakesh kii vahi kitaab yaad aati he
 Or moonlight on the birds! Hardly anyone has read such a free book of free travel
 hriday kii muktavastha isi ko kehete honge shaayad
 However, Ajay Sodani's book 'pass Pass Himalaya' basically describes two journeys
 pehali yatra kalindi khaal kii he, jise darron kaa sirmaur kaha gaya he
 The writer traveled with the whole family
 yah iskaa ek or aakarshan he
 It is recorded in the book that the name of the Sodani family is recorded in the Limca Book of Records that in 2006 it became the first family to cross this pass
 duusari yatra uttarkashi, gangottaree se aage kii he, jise lekhak ne pandavon ke padchinhon par kaha he
 The purpose of which is said to be understanding to see the biodiversity of the Himalayas
 yatraaon ke bich bich main ‘yatraaon se pare’ ke antargat kuch mashhoor yatriyon ke samaran hai, kuch diarinuma tipen hai
 Above all, the writer of a traveler is a transforming personality
 jo pahaado kii barphani sundarata ko dekhte hue, avalanch ko dekhte hue dhire dhire badalata ja rahaa he
 You as a reader can feel that conversion
 armbh main gadhy varnanaatmak he jo dhire-dhire kaavyatmak hota jaataa he
 In between, the author has also quoted poems, lions etc
 pustak kaa prakaashan ‘sarthak’ shrinkhalaa ke antargat kiya he, jo raajakmal prakaashan kaa ek upkram he pathakon se sidhe judane kaa
 It is good that publishers are now turning to the readers, they have realized that the time has come for books to come out of libraries' warehouses
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki pustak melon, sahitya utsavon ne dhire dhire vah maahaul bananaa shuru kar diya he jisase kitabon kaa nikash pathak banate ja rahe hai
 There is an absolute need in Hindi for such books, which do not have a load of genres, do not have the burden of so-called sociality
 kisaan-mazdooron ke prati vah juthi samvednaa, jisane pidiyon ko aalochak banaaya, pathakon ko bargalane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is good that there is an increasing understanding in Hindi that literature is actually a middle class enterprise and its purpose is to make the readers happy
 samaaj ko badalane, pathakon ko shikshit karne kaa kaam uskaa na tha, na he
 The understanding of this has increased among writers and it is good that publishers too
 jo kitabon ke prastutikaran ke peshewar najariye main dikhaai dene laga he
 'pass Pass Himalaya' is a very beautifully conceived book that will prove to be a pioneer in the coming times, i think as a reader-writer
 aane vaala se samay main hindi ke lekhak hindi vibhaagon ke massaab se kisaan-majdoor brands certificate se nahin balki pathakon ke najariye se aaenge, aane chahie
 It is necessary for the confidence of Hindi
 baharhaal, abaki himalay kii god main based kisi shahar gaya to vahaan padhne ke liye ‘darra darra himalay’ lekar jaaoongaa
 The feeling of reading it there will be different
 philhal aapako mauka mili to apane apane maidaanon main gadiyon kii pon-pon, jivan kii bhaagambhag ke bich ise padhakar dekhiegaa
 Will be relieved
 ('janakipul' se saabhaar) In a hotel in Surat, Gujarat, a man set his girlfriend (24) on fire

 He told that he suspected Bhavna's character

 We are not a Banana Republic ruled by an autocratic king
 ’’ yah kahana he us afasar kaa jisane siyaasi sambandhon ke dam par kaarobaari bane robert wadra kii bachi-khuchi vishwasaneeyata bhi khatm kar di
 Since joining the Haryana cadre in 1991, 47-year-old Ashok Khemka has consistently violated the unauthorized order of the Indian Administrative Service - the Minister of Spades, the signature of yours
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ham sabhi (civil sevak) sarkaar kaa hissaa hai
 The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister are not public servants but public servants, as we are all the rest
 lekin hamane in logon ko raja-rani kii tarah samajhnaa shuru kar diya, jinke har aadesh kaa paalan bina koi chuun kiye karte rahaa jaae
 "khemka's anger can be understood
" robert wadra or real estate diggaj dlef ke bich ek-duusare kii madad karne vaale sambandhon par ungali uthaane vaale khemka ko 11 aktubar ko haryana ke bhoomi registration vibhaag ke pramukh pad se tatkaal prabhaav se hataa diya gaya
 This is what many leaders and officers wanted
 ek dispech clerk raat ko 10 baje ke baad chandigarh sthit unke awaas par transfar aadesh lekar gaya
 Because three days ago Khemka had sought a list of all the land deals of Vadra in four districts of Haryana, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Palwal and Mewat
 yah khabar 8 aktubar ko akhabaaron or tivi kii surkhiyaan bani thi
 Khemka had directed the deputy commissioners of the four districts to make a list of all the documents about Vadra or the registry done on their behalf after January 1, 2005
 khemka ko sitambar ke ant main hi yah pataa lag gaya tha ki wadra ke swaamitv vaali skylite hospitality privet limited ne farvari, 2008 main shikohpur gaanv ke kisaanon se 3
 Bought 53 acres of land
 dilli se kareeb 40 kimi duuri par sthit is plot ke liye skylite ne 7
 5 crores Rs
 die the
 The ownership of this land was implemented within 24 hours from February 13, whereas generally it takes up to six months
 28 march, 2008 ko wadra kii company ko is baat kii bhi ijaajat mil gai ki vah 2
 Change of land use license (CLU) for 7 acres of land and build residential houses on it
 lekin iske chaar maah se bhi kam samay main wadra ne yah jameen dlef universal ko 58 karod ru
 Sold in khemka ke mutabik, wadra kii company ne is jameen main bas itnaa kiya ki usne land yuj license main badlaav kara liya, isse is jameen kii keemat chah guna bad gai
 Skylight was handed a Letter of Intent to change the license (LOI) within 18 days of application and only after one month of purchasing the plot
 is eloai ko mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ne manjuur kiya or isaki jaankaree vaala ek patr hooda ke pramukh sachivon main se ek chatar singh ke hastakshar ke saath skylite ko bheja gaya
 Chhatar Singh claims that he does not remember the details of the case and insists that everything is done according to the law
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki aam taur par sielue aavednon par eloai manjuur hone main 90 din tak lag jate hai
 DLF declined to respond to a detailed questionnaire sent by India Today
 isamen hamane poocha tha ki kya unhone haryana sarkaar kii anuchit krupa se shikohpur plot kaa mulya bad jane kaa laabh uthaaya he or wadra ke saath unke kis tarah ke rishte hai
 Khemka's interest was picked up in the media on 8 October and reports indicated that Vadra-owned Skylight Realty, Real Earth Estate, Blue Breeze Trading, Artex and North India IT Parks also did the same
 Kind of method is adopted
 kheti kii jameen kharidi gai, land yuj main tabdili karai gai or use real estate companiyon ko bech diya gaya
 But the person investigating it faced a transfer order for the 43rd time in his 21 years of service
 haalanki khemka apane tabadale se ‘santusht’ hai lekin ve haryana ke ‘sabase zyada dhakiyaae gaye afasar’ ke rup main prasiddh hai or unke liye shsaja ke taur par posting aam baat he
 His friends call him a "precautionary" honest and determined person
 rajya ke electronics vikaas nigam hartron main managing diarector ke pad se hataae jane se pehle 20 july, 2012 ko unki tainaati bhoomi chakbandi, records or registration vibhaag main kii gai thi
 He questioned the allocation of projects on the amount raised without tender
 transfar ke baad bhi khemka dare nahin
 On October 12, writing a letter to the chief secretary, he asked him to reconsider his decision to abruptly withdraw
 unhone is patr main saat aise gaanvon kii suchi di jinamein ‘‘panchayaton kii saikadon karod ru
 Land of value was given to such real estate companies which had stood up only a few days ago
 ’’ in gaanvon main dilli ke paas gudgaanv-faridabad road ke samanaantar sthit baad-gujars, rojka-gujars, kot, chirsi, ankhir, shikohpur, malikpur, bangad or kalesar hai
 Thereafter, on October 15, he made his last blast as Director General cum Registration Inspector General of the Consolidation and Land Records Department of Haryana
 unhone teen pej kaa ek aadesh jari kar shikohpur ke 3
 Ordered to revoke the ownership of the 53-acre plot
 lekin 24 ghante ke bheetar hi rajya sarkaar ne is aadesh ko khaarij kar diya
 In the clarification issued on October 16, the order was stated to be against the rules, saying that no party was given an opportunity to present its case
 khemka kaa kahana he ki is maamle main pakshon ko apni baat rakhane kii jarurat hi nahin thi kyonki iske tathyon ke bare main kabhi koi vivaad nahin rahaa he
 He said, "the government knows that any competent revenue officer can implement the ownership change afresh
 ’’ unhone ise isliye khaarij kiya tha kyonki yah kaam gudgaanv ke sahaayak chakbandi adhikari ne kiya tha jo malikana badlaav ke liye sakasham adhikari nahin he
 Khemka was born in a middle-class Marwari family in Kolkata
 unke pita shankaralal khemka elliance jute mil main accountint ke rup main kaam karte the
 Khemka was a topper student of iit-kharagpur
 unhone 1990 main mumbai ke tata institute of fundamental research se computer science main piechdi kii
 a year later, he was selected in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS)
 khemka or unka parivaar 1997 se hi chandigarh sthit haryana sarkaar ke transit quarter main do kamaron ke ek saadhaaran se makaan main rahata he, jabaki 2007 main unhen vittiya kamishnar ke rup main senior rank main pramotion mil chukaa he or kaayade se unhen ek bada bangala milanaa chahie
 His study room shows steel furniture, a bed and a rusty old Godrej almirah
 wadra-dlef saude ko radd karne ke aadesh jari karne se ek din pehle 14 aktubar ko unhen kai dhamkee bhare phone aae, jisamen chetavanee di gai thi ki unka or unke parivaar kaa bahut bura hashr hoga
 In such a call, he was also being threatened to give betel nut to kill him
 khemka ne ise ‘‘chintajanak’’ bataaya
 His family is not provided any security and his son below the age of 18 often moves from Chandigarh to his college in South India

 There is a lot of pressure on Ashok Khemka which is clearly visible
 16 aktubar ko tivi par chalane vaali lambii bahason main kam-se-kam do baar khemka fafik kar ro pade
 They say they are not afraid of anything because they are right
 phir bhi ve kehete hai ki, ‘‘iske baavjood agar koi keemat chukaani padati he to main ise apana naseeb hi samajhuunga

 But with this whole exercise it seems that Khattar's cabinet minister Anil Vij is not happy

 He said, 'alliances with JJP are helpless'
 vahiin bijepi vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad siem manohar laal khatter kii maujuudagi main kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki siem khatter ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa chun liya gaya he or ab vah sabhi vidhayakon ke saath rajyapal ke paas sarkaar daawa pesh karenge
 Along with this, he said that no support is being taken from Gopal Kanda
 isse pehle shuukravaar kaa din haryana kii raajnneeti ke lihaaz se kaafii garmaya rahaa
 Now though the BJP has decided to form a government with the JJP, but the entire exercise that went on yesterday was to gain the support of the independent mlas
 bijepi sarkaar ke liye sabase pehle jin vidhayakon kaa samarthan jutaya gaya unamem gopal kanda bhi the
 But after being constantly gritty, BJP has completely shunned Kanda
