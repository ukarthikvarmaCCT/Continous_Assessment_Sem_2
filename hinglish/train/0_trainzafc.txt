 " i am always surprised at the uproar over the issue of giving sex education in schools
 aakhir kuch log kyon bhadak jate hai or aarope lagane lagate hai ki isse maasoomiyat nasht ho jaaegi? mujhe lagata he ki unki najar main sex ajukeshan shiksha na hokar bacchon ke saath kaamuk vishyon yaa kamobesh ashleel baton par hone vaali charchaa he
 For this reason, they roam freely
 lekin samay aa gaya he ki ve jaagen or vaastaviktaa ko jaane ki ye sari gandagi adhikansh bacchon tak mahaj ek batan yaa mouse ke clic ke saath pahunch rahi he
 Can't believe it? So type 'how to' in the Google search bar and see how 'how to do sex' or 'how to kiss' are served to you in a unique way
 isliye mithkon ke makadzaal se baahar nikalen
 In today's world sex education is as important as reading, writing and mathematics
 agar yah prastaav ajeeb lagata he to in aasaan sawaalon kaa jawaab den:aap chaahate hai ki aapkaa baccha apane sharir main ho rahe badlaavon par shame mahasoos kare?aap chaahate hai ki aapkaa baccha sex se judi jaankaree porn site se hasil kare?aap chahenge ki aapkaa baccha is soch ke saath bada ho ki sex gandi cheez he or biimaar maansikta vaale hi sex ke bare main sochate hai?kya aap chahenge ki aapkaa baccha yon hinsa kaa shikaar ho jaae, kyonki vah shaayad samaj hi na paae ki uske upar kya guzar rahi he or use apane bado kii madad leni chahie
 If the answer is 'no' then you should assume that sex education is very important for children
 mere pati or maine tay kiya tha ki bacchon ke bade hone ke dauraan unhen sahaj or swaabhaavik tareeke se sex ajukeshan di jaaegi
 Our entire family has been interested in wildlife, so our children were very familiar with words like animal mating and breeding
 mujhe yaad he ki main apane chaar saal ke bete ko england main life science mujium dikhaane le gai thi, vahaan usne bacchon ke liye banaae gaye ek video main dekha ki kaise ek bachche kaa janm hota he
 She liked the video very much and was flooded with questions
 hamane aasaan bhashaa main jawaab die or vah samaj gaya tha
 We told the daughter like this too
 jaise-jaise ve bade ho rahe the, sawaalon kaa dayera bhi bada ho rahaa tha or ham koshish karte ki unhen tathyaparak jaankaree den
 Sometimes his questions made him uncomfortable
 skulon main sex ajukeshan kii shuruyaat junior grad se hi honi chahie
 According to research, children are reaching the threshold of puberty a little earlier than in the last decade
 pehle ladkiyaan 10 or 13 ke bich or ladke 11 se 14 tak yauvanavastha par pahunchate the, par ab ve ek-do saal pehle hi tarunai par pahunch rahe hai
 Therefore, it is in their interest to give sex-related information to children at the right time
 aankadon ke mutabik, scandinavian deshon main anya deshon ke mukaable kishoron main garbhadhaaran or yon sankramit rogon ke maamle kaaphi kam paae gaye hai
 Apparently, comprehensive sex education being given to children from the age of 10 years will have an important role behind it
 aakhir sex ajukeshan kis tarah di jaae? sabase acha tarika he ki bacchon ko ladke or ladakiyon ke alag-alag samoohon main baanta jaae or uske baad unhen sex se jude vishay par jaankaree di jaae
 This will not make them hesitate to ask questions
 ise zyada prabhavi banane ke liye maa-baap ke liye bhi aisi charchaa kaa aayojan kiya jaae or unhen bhi is vishay par sahajata se baatcheet karne ke liye taiyaar kiya jaae
 The teacher should be able to give easy and correct answers to children's sex questions
 sabase jaruri he ki seekhney kii puri prakriya bacchon ke liye bhaavnaatmak taur par sukun bhari ho, jahaan kisi bhi sawaal par unke bare main koi najariya na bane, na hi majaak udaaya jaae
 Topics taught include physical changes between boys and girls, attraction to the opposite sex, erections, periods, hygiene, sexual orientation, conception, pregnancy, birth, issues between boys and girls, and measures to protect against the cyber world Join
 kishoron ke saath kii jane vaali charchaa ko zyada dilachasp banane ke liye cinema, sangeet or khel kaa sahaara liya ja saktaa he
 The most important is to understand what is good touch, bad touch and what is sexual violence? Children need to be taught how to protect themselves and also tell them how to protect themselves if they feel insecure
 iske liye khulkar baaten karen, charchaa karen or khud karke dikhaaen jab tak ve acchhee tarah se samaj na jaaen

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni attributed the clean sweep to the team's new players in the four-match series against Australia, saying that he always performed better and responsibly
 tippaniyan After winning by six wickets on the third day of India's fourth and final Test match, Dhoni said, "we went through a difficult period but our players learned a lot during that difficult time and tried it here
 main pehle bhi kahata rahaa ki saajhedaariyaan nibhaana jaruri tha jo ham nahin kar paa rahe the
 Not every player will score a century
 ham jis saajhedaari kii baat karte the aakhir main hamane yahaan unhen nibhaayaa
 He said, 'this series was very important for us

 The bowling was almost the same but the batting lineup was almost completely changed
 aise main prayek khilaadi kaa swayan jimmedaari uthaanaa jaruri tha or main samajhataa hum ki unhone bakhubi aisa kiya
 All the players performed well
 ’ Australia had beaten India 4–0 in the previous series, Dhoni was asked if it was a changed series, adding, “it does not matter if it is 4–0, 2–0 or 3–1
 main badla jaise shabd ke bare main nahin sochataa
 If i talk about this, the matter of spirit of cricket will arise

 hamane chaaron maichon main tas ganvaae lekin unamem ham jeet darj karne main safal rahe
 ' bharat kii chauthe or antim test match ke tisare din hi chah wicket se jeet ke baad dhoni ne kaha, ‘ham mushkil daur se gujarey the lekin hamaare khilaadiyon ne us mushkil samay main kaaphi kuch siikhaa or use yahaan aajamaaya
 i have been saying before that it was necessary to pursue partnerships which we were not able to do
 jaruri nahin ki prayek khilaadi shatak jamaaye
 Finally, the partnership we talked about, we played them here
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamaare liye yah shrunkhlaa kaaphi mahatvapurn thi
 There were some changes in our team
 gendbaaji to lagbhag waisi hi thi lekin ballebaaji linep lagbhag puri tarah se badali hui thi
 In such a situation, it was necessary for each player to take responsibility for himself and i think he did it well
 sabhi khilaadiyon ne acha pradarshan kiya
 ' australia ne pichhali shrunkhlaa main bharat ko 4-0 se haraaya tha, dhoni se poocha gaya ki kya yah badale vaali shrunkhlaa thi, unhone kaha, ‘yah myne nahin rakhata ki yadi 4-0, 2-0 yaa 3-1 hoti he
 i do not think of a word like revenge
 is par baat karuunga to spirit of cricket kii baat uth jaaegi

 Unhappy over the late change in the Congress organization of former CM Bhupendra Singh Hooda, the BJP under the leadership of Manohar Lal Khattar has once again come to power in Haryana
 lekin purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke netritv main utari congress ne bijepi ko bahumat ke aankade ko chune nahin diya
 As a result, the BJP has to form a government with the JJP
 is dauraan manohar laal khatter sarkaar ke shapath grahan main shaamil hone aae bhupendra singh hooda kaa dard chhalak gaya
 Bhupendra Singh Hooda said that if the change in Kikangras organization had happened earlier, the election results of Haryana would have been different
 unhone kaha ki chunaav se 15 din pehle sanghathan kaa badlaav hua he
 This means that the pain of late changes in the organization lies inside Hooda
 loksabhaa chunaav kii haar se niraash congress ke liye bhupendra singh hooda haryana main ek baar phir sanjivani bane
 Congress has been successful in winning 31 of the 90 seats in Haryana
 jabaki 2014 main congress 15 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 In this way, Hooda has doubled the Congress seats
 darasal, congress alaakaman ne bhupendra singh hooda ko haryana main cheharaa banane or kumari shailaja ko pradesh adhyaksh banane kaa faisla vidhansabha chunaav elaan se mahaj 15 din pehle liya he
 In such a situation, the question arises that the Congress high command did not delay in expressing confidence in Bhupendra Singh Hooda, which the party had to bear
 tanvar ko lekar chalati rahi khinchatandilachasp baat ye he ki 2014 kevidhansabha chunaav ke baad se bhupendra singh hooda haryanake tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh rahe ashok tanvar ko hataane kii maang karte rahe, lekin congress kaa sheersh netritv ise najar andaaj karata rahaa
 The situation became such that Hooda rallied in Rohtak and gave an ultimatum to the Congress high command to remove Tanwar
 iske baad kahin jaakar pradesh adhyaksh pad se ashok tanvar ko hataakar kumari shailaja ko party kii kaman saunpi gai or bhupendra singh hooda ko sielpi leader or haryana main congress kaa cheharaa banaaya gaya
 On 4 September, Congress President Sonia Gandhi decided to enter the electoral arena with the face of Bhupendra Hooda's face in Haryana
 haryana main hooda ko congress pratyaashiyon ke chayan se lekar chunaav main har faisle ke liye puri chhot di gai
 Hooda contested the entire election on local issues and pitched himself as an alternative to Khattar
 isi ke chalate jat samudaay kaa bada tabaka hooda ke naam par congress ke saath ekajute hota dikhaai diya
 Its effect was shown in the election
 bijepi ke 75 paar naare par grahan lag gaya or 40 seat par atak gai
 Had the Congress high command Bhupendra Singh Hooda been entrusted with the command earlier, the results in Haryana would have been different

 loksabhaa chunaav ke tisare charan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii saakh daanv par lagi he
 Because in all the 26 Lok Sabha seats of modi-shah's home state Gujarat, votes will be cast on April 23 in the third phase
 pichley do dashak se yahaan bijepi kaa ecchhatra raaj kaayam he
 In 2014, the BJP was successful in winning all 26 seats in Gujarat with a clean sweep
 lekin, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne jis tarah se pradarshan kiya he
 After this, in the Lok Sabha elections, modi-shah has a tough challenge to retain the bjp's dominance in his state
 pradhanmantri narendra modi is baar gujarat se chunavi maidan main nahin utre hai, lekin bijepi adhyaksh amit shah gandhinagar seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 The seat has been held by veteran BJP leader LK Advani, who has not been given a ticket this time by the party
 gujarat bijepi kii prayogshaala maani jaati he
 In such a situation, Narendra Modi, while campaigning in Gujarat, is constantly appealing to win all the seats once again
 90 ke dashak main bijepi gujarat kii siyasat main apni aisi jaden jamaain ki aaj tak koi chunauti nahin de sakaa
 From the assembly to the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP kept speaking
 1995 main bijepi gujarat kii satta par kabiz hui
 In 2014, BJP got the maximum 26 seats
 isse pehle ke nateezon ko dekhen to 1991 main bijepi ke khate main 20 siten mili thi, ye 2014 se pehle sabase behatar parinaam tha
 The BJP has been successful in winning 16 seats in 1996, 19 in 1998 and 20 seats in 1999
 bataa den ki 2002 main gujarat kii satta par narendra modi virajman hue to loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii siten badhane ke bajaay ghat gayi
 The BJP won 14 seats in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections and 15 in 2009
 haalanki jab narendra modi pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar bane to gujarat kii sari kii sari siten bijepi ko milin
 For the first time in two decades, the Congress was successful in giving a tough fight to the 2017 assembly elections in Gujarat
 congress bhale hi bijepi ko satta se bedakhal kar satta ke vanvaas ko khatm nahin kar saki
 But for the first time in Gujarat's politics, the BJP did not let the 100 figure touch
 bijepi ko 99 siten mili jabaki congress 81 siten jeetne main safal rahi thim
 While BJP President Amit Shah had a target of 150 seats in Gujarat
 congress ne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke ran main bijepi ko gherne ke liye pradesh ke teen yuva netaaon kii tikdi kaa istemaal kiya tha
 These included Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, Patidar leader Hardik Patel and OBC leader Alpesh Thakor
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is dauraan jamkar mehnat kii thi
 The result was that 59 in 2014 to the BJP
 1 fisadi mili the vah aankada 2017 main 10 fisadi ghatakar 49
 Had come down to 1 percent
 modi ke gujarat main rahete hue congress ko gujarat main loksabhaa chunaav main bahut zyada nuksaan nahin hua tha
 Now that Lok Sabha elections are being held, Alpesh Thakor has said goodbye to the Congress and Jignesh is campaigning for Kanhaiya in Begusarai, Bihar instead of Gujarat
 jabaki hardik patel congress kaa daaman thakar party ko jitaane ke liye puri takat laga rahe hai
 The Congress has set a target of winning half of the 26 seats in Gujarat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 congress ne mishan-13 kaa plana banaaya he
 All these seats are from the rural areas of Gujarat, including Anand, Amreli, Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Patan, Junagadh, Dahod, Bardoli, Surendranagar, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Bharuch and Mehsana Lok Sabha seats
 darasal congress ne in siton ko jeetne ke liye isliye focus kar rahi he ki vidhansabha chunaav main in siton par nattejey uske paksh main the
 Apart from this, the way Congress President Rahul Gandhi is raising the issue of farmers and has promised to give 72 thousand rupees annually to the poor
 isse congress ko yahaan or majbootee kii ummid najar aa rahi he
 Whereas, the challenge is for Narendra Modi to win his home state of Gujarat for the second consecutive time in power
 aise main agar vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah loksabhaa chunaav main siten ghatati hai to modi or shah ke upar sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 That is why the third phase is considered very important for both these top leadership of BJP

 Actress Sridevi, who made her film debut as a child artist at the age of just four, has said that she does not want her daughter Jahnavi to make her film debut at this age
 tippaniyan Sridevi, who is going to make a comeback after about 15 years with the film 'english Vinglish', said that it is too early for her to appear in films
 kai saare kaaryakramon main vah ek beti, ek mitra ke rup main mere saath aati he or main use laana pasand karti hum
 This does not mean that she is going to appear in films
 gauratlab he ki aisi afvaahen ud rahi thi ki shridevi kii badi beti jahnavi (15) karan johar kii telugu film ke saath abhinay jagat main padaarpan karne ja rahi he, jo shridevi or chiranjeevi abhinit film ‘jagadeka virudu athiloka sundari’ kii sikval hogi
 The film was later dubbed into Hindi under the name 'man and Apsara'
 abhinetri ne kaha, aisa nahin he ki main use aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahi hum yaa vah charchaa main rahanaa pasand karti he
 It is unfortunate that many times people misunderstand
 ullekhneey he ki shridevi ne varsh 1967 main chaar saal kii umr main tamil film ‘kandan karuni’ ke jariye abhinay kii duniya main kadam rakhaa tha or baad main kai tamil, telugu or malayalam filmon main kaam kiya tha
 He acted in his first Hindi film 'julie' in the year 1975
 kareeb 15 saal ke baad film ‘english winglish’ ke jariye vaapasi karne ja rahi shridevi ne kaha, filmon main uskaa aana abhi jaldibaji hogi
 She attends me as a daughter, a friend, and i like to bring her in many shows
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki vah filmon main aane ja rahi he
 There are rumors that Sridevi's elder daughter Jahnavi (15) is going to make her acting debut with Karan Johar's Telugu film, which will be the sequel to Sridevi and Chiranjeevi starrer Jagadeka Virudu Athiloka Sundari
 is film ko baad main ‘aadmi or apsara’ naam se hindi main dab kiya gaya tha
 The actress said, it is not that i am trying to push her forward or she likes to be in the discussion
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki kai baar log galat samaj lete hai
 It is notable that Sridevi entered the acting world at the age of four through the Tamil film 'kandan Karunai' in 1967 and later worked in many Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films
 unhone varsh 1975 main apni pehali hindi film ‘juli’ main kaam kiya tha

 Which was shared by Twitter
 maaloom ho ki kuch vakt pehle mujeec diarector preetam ne bhi kuch isi tarah se kuch vakt pehle ek sadakon par gane vaale bachche ko khoj nikaala tha
 Pritam posted a video of a Sikkim street singer in June and sought help from social media users to locate him
 akshay kii hitler jaisi moochon par phans ne lee chutki, is tarah hui tulanapritam ke mutabik vah santosh kii saarangi kii dhun se prabhavit hue hai or jald hi is dhun ko apane mujeec main shaamil karenge
 Please tell that a youtube user named Pravesh Kshetri had shared Santosh's video on June 14
 dekhnaa yah hoga ki kya vishaal bhi is sant ke saath milakar koi mujeec video banaaenge? BJP MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj has supported the state of Madhya Pradesh to five saints by the Madhya Pradesh government
 is bare main poochne par sakshi maharaj ne kaha ki acha he ki madhya pradesh sarkaar ne kam se kam santon ko rajyamantri kaa darja diya, asanton to ko nahin
 It is worth noting that Sakshi Maharaj is a saint himself and continues to teach
 anusuchit jati kanoon ko lekar supreme court ke faisle ke baad hui hinsa ke bare main sakshi maharaj ne aarope lagaaya ki vipakshi partiyaan jaanboojhkar logon ko bhadakaakar hinsa kara rahi hai
 Because they fear that the Dalits may go away with the BJP again
 unhone kaha ki in partiyon ko daliton ke hiton kii chintaa nahin he balki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue vah aisa kar rahi hai
 Rahul Gandhi is also constantly attacking the BJP regarding the Dalit Act
 isko lekar sakshi maharaj ne kaha, rahul gandhi lagaataar galat bayanon se is bare main bhram failaa rahe hai
 Sakshi Maharaj said that whatever the opposition parties may plot, the Dalit is firmly with the BJP
 kyonki vah jaanate hai ki bijepi hi unke hiton kii raksha ke liye hameshaa tatpar rahati he
 BJP leader asked- Will the dacoits be given ministerial status? At the same time, BJP leader Prabhat Jha asked the Congress to raise questions on the matter of granting the status of Minister of State to the saints in Madhya Pradesh, whether the Congress party is also the minister of the saints
 Can you rate? He said if the saints will not be given ministerial status, will the dacoits be given ministerial status
 darasal madhya pradesh sarkaar ne chunavi saal main adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko saugat dene ke baad absadhu-santonke liye apana pitara khol diya he
 Madhya Pradesh government has given the status of Minister of State to Narmadananda, Hariharanand, Computer Baba, Bhagyuji Maharaj and Yogendra Mahant

 Distribution of three major offerings has been banned in the sanctum sanctorum of Kashi Vishwanath temple
 desh-duniya ke darshanathiyon ko garbhagrih main ab sirf baba kii jhalak hi mil sakegi
 There, neither a molly will be tied on the wrist of the devotees as a rakshaasutra, nor a tilak can be applied
 baba ke charanodak kaa prasad bhi pujari bhakton ke haath par nahin denge
 The Nyas Parishad has decided to implement this system to maintain the sanctity of the sanctum sanctorum of Baba Vishwanath, one of the two Jyotirlingas
 swarna shikharon vaale kaashi vishwanath ke garbhagrih main darshanathiyon ke saath pujaariyon ke bartaav ko lekar shikaayatein mili thim
 There was a complaint that in the sanctum sanctorum of Dakshina's benefit, the priest in the sanctum sanctorum, tied the molly to it and offered it as a Prasad after taking out the Charanodak
 isse garbhagrih kii pavitrataa or maryaada bhang hoti he
 In the recent Trust Council meeting, the Chairman of the Executive Committee and some members had suggested that the Charanodak should not be distributed in the sanctum sanctorum
 garbhagrih main mauli baandhne or maathe par tilak lagane kii pravriti par bhi etraj jataayaa gaya tha
 Finally, the Trust Council took the matter seriously and directed Chief Executive Officer SK Maurya to make arrangements to distribute charanodak outside the sanctum sanctorum in the temple premises and distribute it among the devotees
 isi tarah baba ke darbar main bhakton ko mauli baandhne or tikaa-chandan lagane kii nai vyavastha shuru karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 In Rajasthan, the increase in electricity prices came as a double blow to the already troubled tomorrow-factories due to note ban
 is vajah se rajya kii kareeb 100 se adhik audyogic ikaayiyon main taale lag chuke hai or 50 hajaar se zyada logon ko rojgaar se haath dhonaa padaa he
 Demand reduced by 70 percent after the ban jo kuch audyogic ikaiyaan chal rahi thim, unamem bhi halaat sudharne tak ke liye talabandi shuru ho gai he
 The businessmen complain that the laborers are not taking salary in the check, while the workers say that if the bankers are not opening their account, then what will they do with the check
 
 
 audyogic ilaakon main pasra sannatarajasthan ke audyogic ilaake vishwakarma main sannta pasra he
 All the factories from steel casting to marble cutting are closed
 aise hi ek kaarkaane mangala industries main mashine band hai or majdoor khaali baithe the
 The factory owner has locked the power seven days ago after more than double the price of electricity
 mangala industries ke maalik seetaram agarwal kaa kahana he ki notebandi kii vajah se industry main kaam ghatakar chauthai bhar hi rah gaya tha, magar bijli kii keemat main sidhe dhai rupee prati unit badhaaye jane se bijli kii khapat vaale udhogon kii qamar tut gai
 Therefore, more than 100 industries have been locked in Rajasthan
 kaarkaanon main talabandi ne todi mazdooron kii kamarkaarkhaanon main is talabandi kii sabase zyadamar mazdooron par padihai
 Further, there is no demand from industries like steel, marble, cement, wood and gems-jewelery
 is vajah se majdoor 40 fisadi tak nikaal die gaye hai
 Out of these, the workers who did not have a bank account, have not received their salary so far and those who had an account were handed over the old notes by the factory owners
 magar disambar main uski bhi gunjaaish nahin hone kii vajah se majdoor naukari se nikaale ja rahe hai
 The workers say that the bankers are not opening new accounts
 kah rahe hai ki 31 disambar ke baad hi nayaa khaataa kholenge, varna kaala dhan safed karoge
 For this reason, laborers are compelled that they need cash salary, they can do some of the checks
 bank khate ke bin behaal mazdoorabihar ke baxur sthit kochas se aae naveen naam ke aise hi ek majdoor kaa kahana he ki ham to koi ghar jaataa he, to uske saath hi ghar nakad paise bhejte hai
 What will we do with the check vahiin upi ke bhadohi ke rahane vaale prashanth bataate hai ki maalik purana paisa de rahaa tha
 What would he have done if he had not eaten
 isliye liye nahin
 Now the bankman is saying that he will open an account with the bank in January
 bataa den ki rajasthan main jawaharaat, textile, marble or pathar jaise industries main badi sankhya main majdoor kaam karte hai
 But in all these places, the work seems to be negligible
 kaarkaanon ke maalikon kaa kahana he ki aage order nahin milane ke alaava industry main cash kii baari killat he
 Everyone says that only after March will understand what will happen next

 Tarun Gogoi is the Chief Minister of Assam for the last 11 years and during this period he himself is busy in maturing his achievements
 haal main ek tivi channel se unhone kaha ki rajya main musalamaanon kii aabaadi kii vruddhi dar hinduon se zyada ho jane kii vajah avaidh bangladeshi ghuspaithiye nahin hai balki musalamaanon main vyaapt ashiksha he jiske kaaran ve zyada bachche paidaa kar rahe hai
 Gogoi says, "most Muslims are illiterate
 har parivaar main chah se das bachche hai
 In fact, by saying so, he underestimated his government's progress in increasing literacy rate in Muslim-majority districts of Assam
 udhaaharan ke liye rajya ke tisare sabase zyada muslim aabaadi (2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik 57
 6 per cent) literacy rate of the district Hailakandi, it is 59 in 2001
 64 fisadi se badhkar 2011 main 75
 Reached 26 percent
 yah puure assam ke ausat 73

 pichley ek dashak main hylakandi kii jansankhya bhi teji se badi he
 According to the 2001 census, this district has a population of 20
 89 fisadi badi thi, vahiin 2011 main isamen 21
 There has been an increase of 44 percent
 yahaan tak ki sabase zyada muslim anupaat (74
 3 per cent) literacy in Dhubri district also 48 of 2001
 17 fisadi se badhkar 2011 main 59
 Has reached 17 percent
 tathy to yah he ki teen sheersh muslim bahul jilon main sakshartaa main sudhaar (teble dekhen) ke baavjood dashakeey jansankhya vruddhi dar main teji ai he
 On the other hand, only 1
 8 fisadi muslim jansankhya vaala jila dhemaji 20
 It is ranked seventh in terms of population growth with a 30 per cent increase
 gogoi ne shaayad bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko waapas bhejne kii maang karne vaale sanghathanon kaa makhul udaane ke liye aisa kaha ho, par kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne yah mana he ki seemaa paar se ghuspaith ab bhi jari he
 Contrary to Gogoi's opinion, he said on 10 September, "we have taken steps to stop it, but it is still going on
" ”natijatan gogoi ko har ore se aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, Rajinder Sachar, who heads the committee that prepared a historical report on the socio-economic condition of Muslims in India, said, “I am shocked
 yah kisi mukhyamantri ko shobhaa nahin detaa
 There is no doubt that illiteracy among Muslims is high, but it is not right to hold them responsible for population growth
 sarkaar kaa yah kartavya he ki vah shiksha kaa prasar kare or vanchit tabake kaa jivan str sudhaare
 Instead of making such statements, they should focus on this
 ” haalanki justise sachhar ne is par koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya ki kya avaidh ghuspaith kii vajah se muslim bahul jilon main jansankhya vruddhi dar zyada he
 Meanwhile, All India United Democratic Front President Badruddin Ajmal has demanded Gogoi's immediate resignation as soon as Gogoi's statement comes
 unka kahana he, “yah kahkar ki assam ke zyaadaatar musalmaan ashikshit hai, unhone khud yah maan liya he ki ve apane kaam main asafal rahe hai
 If the population is increasing due to illiteracy among Muslims, what have they done in 11 years? After accepting the responsibility of the BTAD crisis, he has now lost the right to continue as the Chief Minister
 ”magar ajmal ke shabd ol assam minurity student union (eemasu) ko prabhavit nahin kar paae hai
 He sees some power in Gogoi's argument
 eemasu ke adhyaksh abdur rahim ahamed kehete hai, “unke bayaan se rajya ke alpsankhyakon ke halaat kaa andaja lag jaataa he
 This is the right time for the government to wake up to meet the needs of the minorities of Assam
 ”udhar gogoi ko acadmic sarkal main bhi samarthak mil gaya he
 Director of Omio Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development B

 Sarma says, "there is evidence to justify what Gogoi has said

 On Mail Today Education Summit, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the profit of education in the country should not be motive
 jaavdekar kaa yah bayaan india today ke group chairman arun puri ke sawaal par aayaa
 During the session, Arun Puri asked the Union Minister what the Government thinks about the process of setting up private schools in the country and what is the Government's opinion on profit motive on opening schools in the private sector
 prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha ki desh main sarkari skool ke do model kendriya skool or navoday vidhyalay sibiesai ke skulon se zyada achche nattejey de rahe hai
 Private school does not mean that all private schools are good
 jaavdekar ne kaha ki jahaan maujuuda samay main sarkari skulon main prati student cost of ajukeshan 2000 rupee he vahiin desh main aise privet skool hai jo mahaj 300 se 400 rupee prati maah kii fees par quality ajukeshan muhaiyaa kara rahe hai
 Javadekar said that the history of education in India needs to be seen from the time of the British
 gulaami ke daur main hamane shiksha par jor dena shuru kiya jisase aaazaad hone ke saath-saath desh ko chalaane ke liye ham taiyaar ho sake
 From this time till the present time, the foundation of schools in the country was laid on the basis of charity
 is tathy ke saath kendriya mantriprakash jaavdekarne daleel di ki ab desh main privet skool bad rahe hai
 But keeping the profit motive of these schools is a matter of great debate
 is vishay par puure samaaj ko bahes main hissaa lene kii jarurat he
 Is there a private school , on the question of should be run on profit basis, the government's direct answer is that education should not be profitable
 kendriya mantri ke is bayaan par arun puri ne poocha ki kya sirf samajaseva ke aadhaar par skool chalaane se desh main mediocrity ko badhaava nahin mil rahaa he
 In response to this, Javadekar said that this assumption is completely wrong as the government figures show that people are coming out of private schools for better education in government schools

 In the ongoing debate on triple talaq in the Supreme Court, on Wednesday, the Center firmly put its arguments before the top court
 atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki centre abhi tripal talaak par bahes kar rahaa he, lekin vah talaak ke sabhi maujuuda tareekon ke khilaaf he
 He said that the Central Government is also ready to bring the bill a step further on this issue
 'maamla bahusankhyak banaam alpsankhyak kaa nahin'centre ne kaha ki yah maamla bahusankhyak banaam alpsankhyak kaa nahin he
 It is a fight for the right of women within a religion
 is maamle main vidheyak laane ke liye centre ko jo karnaa hoga vah karegaa, lekin sawaal ye he ki supreme court kya karegaa?iske baad chif justise ne kaha ki asprishyata, bal vivaah yaa hindutv ke bheetar chal rahi anya saamaajik buraaiyon ko supreme court andekha nahin kar saktaa he
 The court cannot deny its responsibility in this case
 '1400 saal se chal rahaa utpeedan he teen talaak'duusari ore atorni general ne kaha ki agar talaak ke teen tareekon ko khatm kiya jaataa he, to centre iske liye prakriya banaaenge
 a community cannot decide whether to uphold personal law against fundamental rights
 unhone kaha ki maamla mard or aurat ke bich shakti santulan ke molbhav kaa nahin he
 It is not a tradition of 1400 years, but persecution that has been going on for 1400 years
 atorni general ne kaha ki jo dharm kaa hissaa nahin he, use khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Court's question to AIMPLB Earlier during the hearing, the court asked the AIMPLB whether it is possible to give the woman the right not to accept divorce if she gives triple talaq
 is close ko nikaahnamaa main bhi shaamil kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki teen talaak ke turant baad bhi shaadi nahin tut sakati he
 Not compelled to accept the advisory of AIMPLB, Kazicourt said that this issue can be implemented only if the Kazi applies the issue to the ground level
 haalanki AIMPLB kii ore se usuf hatim ne kaha ki AIMPLB kii adwijuri ko maananaa sabhi kaazi ke liye jaruri nahin he
 Although they may accept our suggestion
 board ne court ko 14 april 2017 ko paas kiye gaye ek faisle ke bare main bhi bataaya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki tripal talaak ek paap he, or aisa karne waalon kaa saamaajik bahishkaar kiya jayega
 Advocate of AIMPLB Advocate Kapil Sibal, on behalf of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, cited the survey report published in an English newspaper
 sibbal ne court ko bataaya ki musalamaanon main ek saath teen talaak vaale mahaj 0
 4 percent are cases
 sibbal ne daleel di ki agar court personal lau main dakhal detaa he to ye ghar ke maamalon main daakhil hone jaisaa hoga
 That is, this method can continue in other cases as well
 jamiyat ulema-e hind kii daleeljamiyat ulema-e hind kii taraf se vakil raju ramchandran ne court ke saamne kaha ki agar teen talaak dene ke baad koi pati apni patni ke saath rahata he to wo gunaah hoga
 Earlier in the hearing on Tuesday, advocate Kapil Sibal, on behalf of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said that the triple talaq has been going on for the last 1400 years
 agar ram kaa ayodhya main janm hona, aasthaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he to teen talaak kaa mudda kyon nahin
 Kapil Sibal said that Islam has given women rights long back
 parivaar or personal lau samvidhan ke tahat hai, yah vyaktigat aasthaa kaa vishay he
 When Justice Kurian Joseph asked Kapil Sibal whether there was any such thing as e-divorce
 centre ne kaha- laaenge nayaa kanoonisase pehle somvaar ko supreme court ne kaha tha ki vah samay kii kami ke kaaran sirf teen talaak ke mudde par hi sunwaayee karegi
 However, the court said that the way of hearing on the issue of polygamy and nikah halala is open to the future
 centre sarkaar ne ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha ki agar sheersh adaalat teen talaak sahit talaak ke sabhi tareekon ko nirastar kar detii he to muslim samaaj main shaadi or talaak ke niyaman ke liye nayaa kanoon laayaa jaaya jayega
 The Center also urged that issues of polygamy and nikah halala should not be separated from the current hearing
 is par sarvocch adaalat ne bharosa diya ki ye sabhi pahalu apni jagah maujuud hai or in par baad main gaur kiya jayega
 Why can't we end triple talaq? During the hearing, Mukul Rohatgi said that if countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Sudan have abolished laws like triple talaq, then why can't we
 atarni general mukul rohtagi ne peeth se kaha, agar adaalat turant talaak ke tareeke ko nirast kar detii he to ham logon ko alag-thalag nahin chodenge
 We will introduce a law for the regulation of marriage and divorce among the Muslim community
 aapako bataa den ki tripal talaak ko lekar 11 may se sunwaayee chal rahi he
 On Friday, the Supreme Court said that we will only review whether divorce-e-biddat i
e
 three divorces at a time and nikah halala is an integral part of Islam religion
 court is mudde ko is najar se bhi dekhegaa ki kya teen talaak se muslim mahilaon ke moolbhoot adhikaron kaa hanan ho rahaa he yaa nahin

 The Uttarakhand BJP has alleged that the state police has tapped the phones of several party leaders and Congressmen opposing Harish Rawat
 yahi nahin, unhone kuch patrakaron ke phone tap kiye jane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 BJP spokesperson in the state Munna Singh Chauhan said that under the Right to Information Police has given information that it has recorded about 378 phone calls since June 2015
 rajyapal se shikaayat karegi bijepibijepi ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki ravat lagatarvidhayakon kii kharid-farokhtki koshishon main jute the
 He plans to complain to the governor to investigate the matter
 chouhan ne kaha ki kai logon ne is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki unke phone tap kiye ja rahe hai or isse unki privesi chhin rahi he
 He also expressed apprehension that phones of BJP mlas and Congress mlas opposed to Rawat are still being taped
 harish ravat par lagaae aropabijepi netaa ne kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki police nehrish rawatake nirdesh par aisa kiya he
 He wants to keep an eye on the opponents
 isamen wo log shaamil hai jo unke raajnneetik virdohi hai
 Some journalists are also being monitored
 ' This does not happen
 naa kabhi hua he ki puri dilli police ek saath chuttee par chali gai ho
 But what to do jab 15-15 jila police or 209 thanon ke rahete dilli kii sadakon par aisi tasviren aam dinon kii baat lagane to shaq hota he ki sachmuch dilli main police he bhi yaa nahin? or agar he or chuttee par bhi nahin he to phir badmaashon ke andar police kaa khauf kyon nahin he?sirf pichley chah maheene ke andar dilli ke ek kone se lekar duusare kone tak sadakon par shootout kii 12 vaaradaaten ho chuki hai
 Questions have already been raised on the Delhi Police regarding the safety of women and the elderly
 ab to sadak par kab, koun, kahaan kisi golibari main funs jaae isaki bhi guarantee nahin he
 Now it seems that we curse UP Bihar
 di-company ke shootaron ko bevajaah bhav dekar unka rate badhaate hai
 On watching the shootout scenes on screen, Anwai claps
 baithe honge dilli main desh ke sarkaar
 The country will move at the behest of Delhi
 par inke aage dilli main kisi kii nahin chalati
 They have also beaten the shooters of Mumbai
 ye ek tasviir sirf tasviir bhar nahin he
 Rather, they are the living evidence of the falling Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and the entire Delhi Police falling Jalal and Iqbal
 jo dilli saal ke 365 din red or hai alert par saansen let ho usee dilli main saare-raah is tarah kisi ko goliyon se chalni karnaa itnaa aasaan hoga soch se pare kii cheez hai
 i do not remember any corner of Delhi where such pictures have not come
 sadak par is tarah shootout kaa trend is teji se bad gaya he ki police naam kii cheez se bharosa hi uth gaya he
 How the police and the police fear
 is shooter ko dekh kar kahin se bhi zaraa sa bhi ahsaas hota he ki ise police-kanoon kaa koi khauf bhi hoga
 It is clear that the police headquarters of Delhi and the fear of the police chief Amulya Patnaik and his force sitting in this headquarters have been going through the hearts of criminals
 agar aisa nahin hota to khuleam sadak par ye sab nahin hota
 Photos are from Dwarka, Delhi
 usee dwarka kii jahaan kuch din pehle hi badmaashon ke bich hue muthbhed kii tasveeron ne siharan paidaa kar di thi
 This photo is from 24 September
 shaam ke chaar baje baje the
 The place was Dwarka Diversion
 ek chaudee si gali kaa seen he
 There are three cars parked on the right side of the street
 bain taraf bhi teen hi car park nazar aa rahi hai
 a bike is also parked in the middle of the car
 saamne kii taraf sadak par acchhee khaasi awajahi he
 a white car is standing at the forefront on the right
 isi car ke driver vaali seat par baithe shaks se ek doosraa shaks kuch baat karata he or saamne kii taraf chalaa jaataa he
 After he leaves, the person on the driver's seat closes the car door
 saamne se ek mahila chali aa rahi he
 But as soon as the woman starts crossing the car, she suddenly gets nervous
 thik usee vakt car bhi achaanat saamne kii taraf badhane lagati he
 The woman leaves
 magar car funs jaati he
 Because by then a boy hangs the bag on the shoulder and hides his face from the helmet, a boy comes right in front of the car
 uske haath main pistal thi
 As soon as he comes in front of the car, he shoots the first bullet under the front mirror of the car, precisely targeting the place where the driver is sitting
 iske baad agle hi second wo driver kii taraf vaali windo se goli daagta he
 The person sitting on the driver's seat had by now realized that it was an attack on him
 lihaaza wo kisi tarah gaadi ko aage bhagane kii koshish karata he
 He also tries to crush the attacker from the car
 magar tab tak goli chaalaate shooter baraabar main godi duusari car ke chat par chadh jaataa he
 Here, as soon as he climbs on the roof
 car main baitha shaks teji se darwaja khol kar donon haathon se qamar pakade saamne kii taraf bhaagta he
 Perhaps he was shot by then
 ab hamalavar car kii chat par chadh kar us bhaagate hue shaks par nishaanaa lagaataa he
 But perhaps the bullet gets trapped in the chamber
 wo do baar fire karata he
 After this, checking the pistol, he escapes from the car
 kuch duuri par hamalwaar kii bike park thi
 He sits on the bike and leaves
 jis shaks ko goli maari gai uskaa naam narendra he
 Narendra is a property dealer
 jahaan par use goli maari gai uske thik saamne uskaa daftar he
 Narendra got two shots
 or inhen do goliyon ne uski jaan le lee
 Apparently the attacker was an enemy of Narendra and sent a shooter to find Narendra
 sirf pichley chah maheene main dilli kii sadakon par khuleam shootout kii ye barahavin vaardaat he
 Now you tell me
 khaali upi-bihar ko kosna kahaan tak sahi he? Lalit Modi may ask for more time to respond to the BCCI
 sutron ke hawaale se aisi khabar he ki modi board se samay ke saath hi kuch or kagajaat bhi maang sakate hai
 The term of suspended IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi's reply to the show cause notice of BCCI ends today
 yani aaj hi lalit modi ko apane upar lage tamaam arompo par safai pesh kerani hogi
 Although there are many serious allegations against Lalit Modi in the bcci's show-cause notice, but Modi has also prepared a set of defense after consulting the lawyers
 gauratlab he ki shokouj notice main lalit modi par kai aarope lagaae gaye hai masalan do tiimon kii boli main gadabadi, prasaaran adhikaar baantne main gadabadi, internet adhikaron kii bikri main gadabadi, ipel tiimon main modi kii hissedari, ipel main taanaashaahee ravaiya aadi
 Following the showcause notice of these allegations, the BCCI recently gave Lalit Modi another show-off notice alleging attempts to launch a Twenty20 cricket league on the lines of the IPL in England
 lalit modi ne in aaropon kaa jawaab taiyaar karne ke liye bisisiai se mili vakt kaa puraa istemaal kiya, vakeelon se salaah lee auki ummid he ki aaj wo apana jawaab saunp sakate hai
 Although the bcci's stand on the allegations is still tough and action against Modi on being found guilty has also been done by BCCI but Modi is also not in a mood to give up
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi somvaar ko loksabhaa main prashnottarkaal ke dauraan party ke 7 saansadon kii anupasthiti se lagata he naakhush hai or party ne sanket diya he ki sambandhit sadasyon ko party netritv kii aprasannataa se avgat karaaye jane kii sambhaavna he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal is expected to write a letter to these party mps in view of the party's unhappiness over the issue
 party netritv ke mood kaa sanket mangalvaar shaam party kii brifing ke dauraan bhi dikhaa jab party pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne yah spasht kar diya ki party ne is maamle ko gambhirtha se liya he
 He said that if party mps were intentionally absent, they could have to face serious consequences
 gauratlab he ki sansad ke pichley satr ke dauraan congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne sansad sadasyon ke sadan kii kaarywahi se anupasthit rahane kii pravriti par chintaa jataai thi or saansadon se sadan main zyada se zyada upasthiti rahane kii ummid kii thi
 On the question whether the Congress president has summoned any list of mps who were in the position, Singhvi said she could ask
 unhone kaha ‘‘yah ham par chhod dijiye
 We have our own internal process to deal with the issue
 anupasthiti par sabhi ne khed jataayaa he
 This is a gross exception and unfortunate
 endie main saath hone ke baad bhi aise kai mudde hai, jis par shivasena or bhartiya janata party kaa rukh alag he
 The Shiv Sena once again chanted the Ram temple, saying that BJP still has an absolute majority and if such a Ram temple is not built in Ayodhya, it will never happen again
 enditivi se shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut ne kaha ki ram mandir kaa nirmaan is saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hona chahie
 Sanjay Raut said that Bharatiya Janata Party has betrayed (cheated) India
 kaaphi samay se humlog ram mandir ke naam par vot maangate rahe hai
 The construction of Ram temple should start before the Lok Sabha elections 2019 so that people can stop doing politics of religion
 bataa den ki shivasena kaa yah bayaan aise vakt main aayaa he, jab haal hi main naye saal par ek intervyuu ke dauraan piem modi spasht kar chuke hai ki jab tak kanoonee prakriya puri nahin ho jaati, tab tak ayodhya main na to ram mandir nirmaan kaa kaary shuru ho saktaa he or na hi sarkaar is par adhyadesh laa sakati he
 At the same time, PM Modi blamed the Congress for the delay in construction of Ram temple
 isse pehle bhi shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne twit kiya tha, ‘ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki ram mandir tatkaal (sunwaayee vaala) maamla nahin he
 PM Modi also did not say anything different
 main unhen maamle par apana rukh spasht karne ke liye badhai detaa hum
 The Prime Minister (PM Modi) says that Ram will not bring any ordinance for the temple
 iskaa sanvaidhanik arth yah he ki bhagwaan ram kanoon se bade nahin hai
 Significantly, in an interview, PM Modi was questioned about the demand of various Hindutva groups to bring ordinance for Ram temple in Ayodhya
 is sawaal ke jawaab main piem modi ne kaha tha ki nyaayik prakriya samaapt hone dijiye
 After the judicial process is over, whatever our responsibility as a government, we are all ready to try
 dhyaan ho ki shivasena ne ramamandir mudde ko lekar apana rukh kadaa kar liya he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had last month at a rally in Maharashtra's Solapur district asked BJP allies to clarify their stand on the Ram temple issue

 on Saturday, May 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited Supreme Court judges for dinner at his residence 7 RCR
 nyotaa paane waalon main supreme court ke jaj justise courian joseph bhi the jinhone naa sirf pradhanmantri modi kaa dinar kaa nivedan thukraayaa tha balki gudfriday or easter ke tyohaar ke bich aise shaskeey aayojan karne ke nirnay par bhi sawaal khadey kiye the
 Justice Kurian wrote a letter to PM Modi, which not only created a lot of ruckus in the media but also raised questions on the secularism of the government
 vahi justise courian videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke saath vatican city gaye sarkari pratinidhimandal main bhi shaamil hai
 The Modi government has sent delegation Sushma Swaraj along with Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal besides Lok Sabha mps Prof
 KV Thomas, Jose Money, Anto Anthony, Konrad Sangma and Goa Deputy CM Francis d'souza
 inke alaava supreme court ke jaj courian joseph, varisht adhivaktaa harish salve bhi delygation main maujuud hai
 This delegation has been sent on behalf of the Government of India to participate in the program of giving the title of Saint to Mother Teresa
 justise courian ne di thi piem modi ko dharmanirpekshata kii duhaisal 2015 main dilli main hai court ke mukhya nyayadhishon kii conference 3 april yani gudfriday ke din shuru hui thi
 Earlier, Justice Kurien wrote a letter to Chief Justice Justice HL Dattu objecting that judges' conferences should not be held on such holy days of Good Friday and Easter
 conference ke agle din shanivaar ko piem modi ke dinar main naa aane ke liye justise courian ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhi or usamen dharmanirpekshata kii duhai dete hue likhaa tha ki is tarah kaa tyohaar log apane parivaar ke saath manaanaa pasand karte hai
 Such events are not held on the day of Diwali, Dussehra, Holi or Eid and you would not even want such events to happen '
 lekin justise dattu ne unki aapatti khaarij kar di thi
 Significantly, Justice Dattu also justified the holding of this conference on Good Friday
 unhone justise courian ko jawaab dete hue kaha tha ki is baat kaa jawaab khud hamen dhundhna chahie ki vyaktigat hit or sansthagat hit main se ham kise variyata den

 usne lakhon vanchiton kii bheed kaa hissaa banane ke liye apana sab kuch de diya
 Nearly a century later, there are no remnants of the high moral standards of that generation - neither in films, nor in real life
 aaj janata ke paise se jutai gai suraksha ke bich hamaare netaa jis tarah aaleeshaan gadiyon main praada praado jaise videshi brandon kaa bebaak pradarshan karte hue farrate bharte najar aate hai, vah is baat kaa pratik he ki raajnneeti ab ek nijee hit saadhane ke udhyam main badal gai he
 The pretense of Khadi and Gandhian values was in the '80s, long before the generation of choice went into politics, Gandhi was left out of the scene with a hat
 yah badlaav 1985 main mumbai main congress shatabdi samaaroh main rajeev gandhi ke bhaashan main parilakshith hota he
 He said that politics is "full of power and power tussle", these brokers give impetus to turn mass movements into feudal totalitarianism
 '' haa, aise log bhi hai jo raajnneeti main janata kii seva karne ke liye hi aate hai, lekin ye log apwaad bhar ho gaye hai, niyam nahin hai

 The report by Org (an undertaking of the Liberty Institute) about the wealth of our elected people's representatives exposes the staggering differences between rulers and governed
 aise desh main, jahaan 77 fisadi se adhik jansankhya yaa anumaanatah 8
 The daily income of 36 crore people is just Rs 20
 ho or 30 karod se adhik log garibi rekha ke neeche rah rahe hon, lagbhag 50 fisadi rajyasabha sadsy or lagbhag ek-tihaai loksabhaa sadasyon ke paas 1 karod ru
 Or more than that
 sirf chotii ke 10 rajyasabha sadasyon or 10 loksabhaa sadasyon kii sampatti ko hi joden to yah kul 1,500 karod ru
 Sits more than pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav haarane waalon main nagaland ke nimthungo-jinaki sampatti 9,005 karod ru
 The assets of the 10 leading candidates are Rs 9,329 crore
 vidhansabha sadsy to kai saansadon kii tulana main kahin adhik dhani hai
 The wealthiest mlas in 30 states have total assets of Rs 2,042 crore
 kii he
 And the thing to note is that out of these 150 crorepati mlas, 59 do not even have a PAN card
 ab rajya kii aarthik takat or vidhayakon ke bank balance main koi sambandh dhundhana na shuru kar dijie
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of poor, say more than one-third of the population i

 9 karod log garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 But the Chief Minister of this state Mayawati is the wealthiest among the 30 Chief Ministers of the country
 isi rajya main 113 karodpati vidhayak bhi hai
 Similarly, 2 out of 6 crore people in Madhya Pradesh
 5 karod log garibi rekha ke neeche nirvahan kar rahe hai, lekin yah rajya 80 karodpati vidhayakon par 'gauravanvit' ho saktaa he
 Marxists have emerged as an exception in this study
 10 rajyon main makapa ke 301 vidhayak hai, lekin sirf do aise hai jinaki ghoshit sampatti 1 karod ru
 Has more than
 makapa ke tikat par jin 537 logon ne chunaav ladaa tha, unamem se sirf saat ke paas 1 karod ru
 Had assets over, and five of them lost the election
 jaisiki puraani kahawat he, satta or satta detii he or paisa paise ko khinchataa he
 Take the last round of the assembly elections
 isane sampatti main vruddhi kii tulana kaa avasar muhaiyaa karavaaya
 In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP was in power, the average wealth of candidates increased fivefold
 karnataka main bhi, jahaan congress or devegoda ke jad (es) ne baari-baari se shashan kiya, congressi sadasyon kii sampatti main paanch guna vruddhi hui
 The good thing is that money is not always a guarantee of success in elections
 2004 main kul 365 karodapatiyon ne loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha; unamem se 88 kii jamaanat jabt ho gai, or 114 duusare number par rahe
 In December last year, the Congress once again learned this important lesson when it saw that Congressmen who lost in the Delhi Assembly elections were more money-rich than those who won on average
 lekin baaki duusari chijen samaan hon to paisa mahatvapurn to hota hi he
 Like other things related to transparency in public life, we are considering it as the foundation, which our political community has thought to declare
 aakhirkaar, ummidavaar dwaara sampatti ke bare main kiye gaye khulaase adhik se adhik may, 2002 or march, 2003 ke supreme court ke do faislon dwaara anivaary qaraar die gaye niyam kaa paalan hi to he
 There are considerable discrepancies in available information
 loksabhaa ke 542 sadasyon main se 522 kii hi sampatti kaa byora uplabdh he
 Similarly, in the Rajya Sabha, only 215 members have declared their assets
 or soochnaaon kii pushti karne yaa jaanch kii koi sansthagat vyavastha nahin kii gai he
 Neither is there any compulsion to disclose the source of assets to the candidates, nor is it mandatory to declare a steady increase in the assets of the candidates
 misaal ke taur par, mizoram main 10 sarvaadhik dhani ummidavaaron main se ek ke paas bhi pan card nahin tha, haalanki unki sampatti 1 karod ru
 Has more than
 isse bhi zyada chintaa kii baat yah ki haalanki jo saansad mantri hai ve apni sampatti kaa vaarshik byora dete hai, lekin vah jaankaree janata ko uplabdh nahin hoti
 In fact, this fact negates the concept of inquiry, which could curb the accumulation of property by stopping the misuse of power
 beshak jo cheez saarvajanik rup se uplabdh honi chahie thi, vah soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ke tahat bhi nahin di ja rahi he
 It is a pity that the office of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh — considered to be the supreme symbol of honesty — has also been included in the decision not to provide information
 or sabase buree baat to yah he ki jahaan kendriya mantriyon ko apni sampatti kaa byora dena padataa he, rajyon ke mantriyon ke saamne aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he
 Yet this fornication of power and property pervades the entire political scene
 ghoshit sampatti or vaastaviktaa ke bich kii yah daraar itani suspasht he ki uski andekhi kii hi nahin ja sakati
 If you look at the difference between the declared wealth of leaders elected to high positions and their luxurious lifestyle, you will easily understand the contradiction
 to jaahir he ki benami sampatti ko to abhi chuaa hi nahin gaya he
 In a country where talent does not get the same opportunity, political power becomes a ladder for leaders to reach the gold mine through manipulation and change in policies
 madhya or ucch madhyavarg ke living room aisi charchaaon se bharpoor hote hai ki kiskaa betaa, beti yaa damaad chal yaa achal sampatti jamaa karne ke liye benami rasta akhriyaar kar rahaa he
 Notes waved in Parliament during the last trust vote for the government, aerial campaign during the last elections in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, money spent on dummy candidates, money given to party offices, trips in Toyota suvs One time expenditure is Rs 75 lakh
 baithta he, or desh bhar main yatra ke liye netaaon dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale nijee charter vimaan raismijaaji ke aise sanketak hai, jinaki andekhi karnaa kathin he
 Bank officials and brokers do not speak in a very condescending language about corporate scams
 kam-se-kam do airlinon, kai achal sampatti udhyamon, pharmaceutical ikaayiyon or infrastracchar companiyon kii benami milkiyat or usase asal main labhanvit hone vaali shakhsiyaton ke bare main bhi atakalein bahut garam hai
 The corporate world concept of sleeping partner (passive partner) has received a new interpretation in the world of politics
 jab tak asli aay, sampatti or netaaon ko milane vaale paise kaa strot apaardarshee rahegaa, tab tak prashasan iske dushprinaam bhugatta rahegaa or vikaas kii balanceshit par loktantr dendariyon vaale khate main hi rakhaa jaataa rahegaa

 com / egegjnlf1g— Harsh beniwal (@iamharshbeniwal) July 17, 2018 If you want to enjoy Kiki, then there are thousands of such videos on the internet, but do not make a video by getting out of a moving car and dancing like this
 aisa karnaa sirf chalange lene vaale ke liye hi ghaatak nahin he, balki road par safar kar rahe anya logon ke liye bhi ye ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he
 There are many ways to measure the accuracy of any pole
 lekin sabase pehali kasuti honi chahie ki kya us surveykshan main sahi vijeta dal kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he? surveykshak apni baatcheet main jis strike rate kii baat karte hai yah vahi he
 That is, how many times the correct winner has been estimated in surveys
 yah strike rate main mote taur par yah andaja de dete hai ki koun si party chunaav jeetne vaali he
 Yes, there is no description of how many seats will win
 agar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hue kul surveykshanon or unke falafalon par najar daali jaae to tasviir alag najar aati he
 Eminent journalist Prannoy Roy writes in his Kitabad Verdict (indian mandate in Hindi), "there have been a total of 833 surveys in the country since 1980, with a strike rate of 75%
 yani har chaar main se teen pole sahi sabit hue hai
 "roy's stated 833 surveys include both opinion and exit surveys and have been conducted for both the Lok Sabha and the Legislative Assembly
 roy aage likhte hai, "strike rate ke aadhaar par eczit pole kii sateekta, opinian pole se behatar he
 Exit polls indicate the correct results four out of every five times
 "agar, 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke pole ke nateezon ko darkinar kar den to zyaadaatar pole sahi or sateek nattejey bataate hai
 Prannoy Roy writes, "polls have been corrected 97 percent of the time, excluding the 2004 surveys in terms of strike rate to identify the right winner
 1980 ke baad se hue 133 loksabhaa surveykshanon main, jinamein 2004 main kiye gaye 34 (16 eczit or 18 opinian pole) shaamil hai, strike rate kam he
 But if we remove the 34 poll of 2004, then it is said that the winner is almost 100 percent correct
 "in aankadon kaa arth yah nahin he ki siton kii sankhya bhi sateek ho
 This figure is just to guess the correct winner
 is lihaaj se dekhen to 2019 main takreeban sabhi eczit pole ek hi vijeta kaa anumaan laga rahe hai or vah, ki centre main agali sarkaar bhaajapa kii banane vaali he
 Now, in these exit polls, which agency can predict only by following its procedures and procedures to convert these vote shares into seats
 gananaa main dosha hone par siton kii sankhya main pherbadal ho saktaa he
 Second, it is a global practice to follow standard deviations in statistical calculations and in making election forecasts
 iskaa arth hua ki voton ke anumaan main adhiktam + / - 3% kii shuddhta seemaa honi chahie
 Many polls do not release their vote share figures
 aise main is maanak vichlan ko ek + / - daayre main jaanchana hota he
 Roy writes, "the increase of 1 per cent vote in the Lok Sabha elections changes about 10-15 seats
 natijatan, voton kii gananaa main + / - 3% kii khami aa jaati he, or isi daayre main purvanumaan lagaaya jaataa he
 In terms of seats, it looks roughly as + / - 35 seats
 misaal ke taur par, maan lijie ki vijeta ko 300 siten hasil hoti hai
 So a poll would be considered accurate if the forecasted number of seats for the winner was 300 to + / - 35 Lok Sabha seats
 isliye agar koi surveykshan apane purvanumaan main 265 se 335 siton kaa dayera de rahaa ho, to ise sateek mana janaa chahie
 "the question is, how close are the predictions of the seats in the surveys to the actual election results? According to Prannoy Roy," The exact survey of Lok Sabha elections (actual seats + / - 35 seats) has been just 54 per cent till date
 Surprisingly, this low accuracy rate of opinion polls is nothing compared to the dismal performance of the Lok Sabha exit poll, with an accuracy rate of just 27 per cent
 "sidhe shabdon main kahen to sirf 27 fisadi eczit pole hi siton kii sahi sankhya bataa pate hai
 Yes, their success rate is very high in telling who will win the Lok Sabha elections
 yani 23 may tak intjaar aise log bhi kar sakate hai jinako lagata he ki bhaajapa ko siton kii sankhya had se zyada dikhaai de rahi hai

 Today's discussion is inspired by the report of the Indian Express
 reporter ritu sharma ke anusaar gujarat sarkaar ne sarkari skulon se kaha he ki deenanath batra kii kitaab ko poorak paath yaa sandarbh granth ke rup main padhaa ja saktaa he
 Not all of them are part of the course, nor are they compulsory
 deenanath batra ne 1994 main hindi main naitik mulyon ko lekar nau kitaaben likhin thim, lekin is saal in kitabon ke gujarati sanskaran laanch hue hai
 The Gujarati translation books carry messages from the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and education ministers
 cover ke bheetar deenanath batra kaa puraa parichay bhi he
 These books will be kept in thousands of schools in the state
 hamaare desh main batra sahit kai log hai jo maanate hai ki is vakt jo aadhukanitha chal rahi he wo pashchim parast he or usee ke kaaran naitik mulyon main baari giravat he
 It is in this context that the Express newspaper Tejomay notes a passage from India in which children are expected not to light candles on their birthdays, this is Western culture
 balki is din swadeshi kapade pahanen, havan karen or apane isht dev se prarthana karen
 Feed bread to cow mother
 din kaa ant vidya bharti ke gane sunakar karen
 a part of our middle class may be disturbed by Batraji's talk, but why not try this experiment first on the same middle class that celebrates more birthdays
 sarkari skulon ke bacchon se hi aisi ummid kyon kii jaae
 Where do the children of middle class and public schools become first time voters of the social media generation, why not ask them to stop cutting this birthday cake with Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck
 mombatiyaan mat phunko, ritern gift mat do, mahange kapade mat pahano
 If they do, they will damage Indian culture
 pataa nahin tivi kaa middle class ye sab sunakar indian culture ke liye kuch countribute yani yogadan karegaa bhi ki nahin
 By the way, i will not do it but if you are discussing, then i am asking the audience
 aap jaanate hai ki gaanv gaanv main kek vaala berth de pahunch gaya he
 i wish this government and this book had come first, then cake and chowmin would never have spread like this
 relax
 This is not an anti-cake program
 batra ji ek sandarbh main baat uthaa rahe hai
 There is a danger in TV that the reference disappears
 ham jaldi kisi nishkarsh par pahunch jate hai
 No law is being advocated, rather it is written with the intention of having a good personality in your children
 par main ek baat par batra ji se or spashtikaran zarur chaahunga
 Tejomay, a book by Batra, advocates a national holiday on 14 August in India
 14 agast ke din pakistan bana tha
 Batra ji wants that this day should be celebrated as Akhand Bharat Smriti Diwas
 shiksha kaa bhartiyakaran main batra bacchon se ek sawaal karte hai ki aap bharat kaa nakshaa kaise banaayenge
 Do you know that Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Tibet, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Burma are part of undivided India
 ye sabhi desh akhand bharat kaa hissaa hai
 Undivided India is the truth
 vibhajit bharat jhooth he
 The partition of India was not natural and it can be reunited
 ek china apane kisi website par apane nakshe main arunachal pradesh kaa chaar paanch kattha zamin shaamil kar letaa he to desh main hangaamaa ho jaataa he or agar ham 14 agast ke din chuttee lekar akhand bharat smriti diwas manaaen to kya hoga
 By the way, on 14 and 15 August, what is the problem? big bazaar 15 agast ke saath 14 agast ko bhi cell laga degaa
 But teach children how to make a map that includes Pakistan, Afghanistan , Nepal, Tibet, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Burma
 ye queshchan he
 i am not saying that your children will forget the current map of India
 par agar ve aisa nakshaa banaaen jisamen ve desh bhi hon jinka apana vajood he to bharat ke padosi deshon ke bare main unki samaj kisi banegi
 One effect may be that they will start loving Afghanistan, Pakistan along with India, but Sri Lanka and Nepal created a ruckus
 isiilie main ye kah rahaa hum ki ye koi saadhaaran baat nahin he
 This challenges the political understanding made or being made about nationalism and memories
 maine batra ji se kitaaben mangavayin
 He also gave it, but before the show could not find the books that the Express newspaper has quoted
 vaise in kitabon ke zyaadaatar prasang achche hai
 No one should have any problem
 aap kahenge ki deenanath batra ji kii kitaab yaa naitik shiksha sangrahon par kyon charchaa kar rahe hai
 Because she is an important figure in the Vidya Bharati Project of the National self-service Association
 modi sarkaar ke kaaran sangh or sarkaar sahodar rup main dekhe jate hai
 Due to the case of Dinanath Batra, this year, the distribution of book written on Hindutva of Wandy Doniger had to be stopped, which also led to a huge controversy
 to is sandarbh main bhi deenanath batra maujuuda sandarbh se bhi zyada vyapak ho jate hai
 Prime time maharashtra bijepi ke varisht netaa gopinath munde ne is atkal ko khaarij kiya ki ensipi netaa prafull patel bhagava dal main shaamil hone ja rahe hai

 unhone kaha ki in afvaahon ke peeche sharad pavaar kaa haath he
 He also said that there is no place for Patel in the NDA and BJP nor does the question of adjusting his mentor Sharad Pawar after the election arise
 varisht bijepi netaa ne kaha ki unki party 235-240 siten jeet sakati he or use apane sahyogiyon kii madad se spasht bahumat milegaa
 In such a situation, the NDA will not need the support of other parties to form the government
 apane bare main unhone kaha ki philhal vah centre main rahenge lekin jarurat padane par maharashtra main laut sakate hai

 So far, it is not known why Shubhi did this
 police dwaara soochna milane ke baad shubhi ke parijan bhi pahunch chuke hai
 The police have started investigating after Shubhi's flat
 police ne bataaya ki maamle main do aise sawaal hai, jo shaq kii sui uske doston kii ore modate hai
 The first question is why his friends did not inform Shubhi's death to the police
 or doosraa sawaal he ki kaaman frand anshuman ne utkarsh ko phone kar shubhi ke sir par chot lagane kii baat kyon kahi

 You write this down and eventually they will try to break the MDP
 lekin jo hamaare dilon main he, use ve kaise samaapt kar denge
 However, this bill could not be discussed in Parliament due to opposition from the opposition

 Anna said that the Maharashtra government has also been lying to the people of the state on lies for the last four years
 yah jhooth zyada dinon tak nahin chalegaa
 The central and state governments have broken the trust of the people of the country
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar kahati he ki unki 90 fisadi maange maang lee gai hai lekin yah ek bada jhooth he
 He always keeps saying that ministers of the central and state government will come to me to talk on different issues
 lekin maine unhen pehle hi manaa kar diya he
 i no longer trust them, that is why i want everything in writing now
 anna hajaare beete chah dinon se anshan par hai

 hajaare ne ravivaar shaam kaha, "agar yah sarkaar agle kuch dinon main desh se kiye apane vaayadon ko puraa nahin karti he to, main apana padam bhushan lautaa duungaa
 "he said," The Modi government has broken the trust of the people
 " 81 varshiya kaaryakarta ko 1992 main teesraa sabase bada naagarik sammaan diya gaya tha
 Anna Hazare is demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations and electoral reforms to address the farmers' woes apart from the appointment of Lokpal, an anti-corruption body at the Center and Lokayuktas in the state

 Thackeray asked Hazare to take the road instead of giving up his life
 saath main unase anurodh kiya ki unhen narayan jaisi bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 The socialist activist fought the Indira Gandhi government in the country in the 1970s
 shivasena netaa ne kaha ki hajaare kaa hashr jidi agarwal kii tarah nahin hona chahie jinhone svachh ganga ke liye anshan kiya tha or unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 Hazare had refused to meet the state government envoy and minister Girish Mahajan to discuss his demands

 Regarding summoning Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the reply on the demonetisation of KV Thomas, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, he said that after the decision of demonetisation on 8 November, Prime Minister Modi said that the situation will be normal in 50 days
 isi kaaran ham 20 janvari ko notebandi or desh ke aarthik halaat par baithak karenge
 In this, RBI Governor and some officials of Ministry of Finance can also be called

 He also gave some examples: -1
 1966 main udyog mantri si
 Subrahmanyam was called by the committee
 2
 The then Finance Minister and Health Minister were also summoned during the Harshad Mehta case in 1996
 3
 Manmohan Singh also appeared before the committee when Murali Manohar Joshi was chairman of the committee during the 2G case
 unhone kaha ki agar pehle aisa hua he to ham loksabhaa spikar kii parmishan ke baad piem ko talab kar sakate hai
 He said that so far there has been no talk from our RBI Governor and Finance Ministry on the issue of demonetisation
 unhone kaha ki ham shuukravaar ko baithak karenge lekin vah kisi or mudde par hogi
 Thomas said that when the meeting is held, any decision will be taken after listening to all the members
 unhone kaha ki hamanen apane sawaal uthaaen hai lekin abhi jawaab milanaa baaki he, notebandi ke liye abhi desh taiyaar nahin tha jiske kaaran logon ko kaaphi takalif bhi hui he
 Many companies have benefited from this

 uttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar ko satta main aae hue ek maheenaa puraa ho chukaa he
 The government claims that government schools and its conditions will improve in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin usase pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki aakhir uttar pradesh main sarkari skulon kii maujuuda sthiti kisi he ?soobe ke sarkari skulonka jayja lene ke liye aaj tak kii team kanpur or utraav jile main rielitche karne pahunchi
 The picture was seen in these government schools beyond expectations, which exposes all the big claims about the government schools in Uttar Pradesh
 pehla skulkanpur-unnav maarg par kanshiramnagar kaa praathmik vidhyalay pahunchen
 After eating the mid-day meal, small children were seen washing their plates on their own under the government tap in the school premises
 gauratlab he ki hamen dekh skool ke pradhanacharya anand kumaar bhi pahunche, lekin bacchon dwaara bartan dhone jane par jab hamane unase sawaal poocha to golmol jawaab dene lage
 The Principal says that after cleaning the mid-day meal, the children clean their mess plates and after that the kitchen or the other dishes are washed
 skool main badahaal shiksha vyavasthapradhanacharya mahoday skool main staff kii kami kaa rone lage
 Not only this, by seeing the pictures inside the schools, you will start getting irritated by the government's claims towards education system
 skool main 4 kamare hai lekin in kamaron main chote chote bacchon ko baithne ke liye naa to bench hai or naa hi padhane ke liye mej
 Small children were seen sitting on the mats and reading
 doosraa skulkanpur ke kanshiram nagar main sarkari skool kaa rielitotest karne ke baad ham aage pahunche unnav jile ke garerepurva gaanv main
 The condition of government schools in the village is much worse than the situation in the cities
 yahaan kii tasviir bhi kanpur se zyada alag nahin he
 All these children were seen sitting on a mat lying on the ground
 skool main badahaal shiksha vyavasthaais sarkari skool main kul milakar 3 adhyaaapak hai jisamen ek pradhanacharya ek sahaayak adhyaaapak or 1 shiksha mitra hai
 But when we arrived, Shikshamitra was not present in the school
 khud pradhanacharya mahoday ne bataaya ki shiksha mitra apane paariwarik kaarnon se chuttee par hai or bacchon kaa sara daaromadar in 2 shikshakon par he
 After the third school, Gerepurpurva, we reached the primary school in Kanhavapur village in Unnao district for the reality test of schools
 skool main padhane vaale teenon adhyaaapak yahaan maujuud the
 But the picture of the school rooms was disappointing
 yahaan bhi pehle jaise haalat mili
 When we asked questions on the lack of basic needs, the other two female teachers, including the Principal, started showing pictures of the administration and government not paying attention to government schools
 skool main badahaal shiksha vyavasthashikshika mahoday ne bataaya unhone bacchon ko jaanwaron ke falon ke subjiyon ke naam likhnaa sikhaaya he lekin jab hamane bacchon se santare kaa angreji main naam poocha to chauthi kaksha ke bachche jawaab nahin de paae bacchon ko kele kaa angreji main naam bhi nahin pataa tha
 a child also said that he does not know the names of fruits in English
 naak ko angreji main noj kehete hai yah kuch bacchon ko pataa tha lekin noj ke angreji main aksharon ke bare main bacchon ko kuch bhi nahin pataa
 The fourth schoolham moved further and reached Muralipur village in Unnao district
 skool main pahunchate hi pataa chalaa ki pradhanadhyaapak mahoday chuttee par hai
 Education friends and assistant teachers are coming to the school, but the Principal was not present
 pichley baaki ke skulon kii tarah yahaan par bhi skool main pard rahe bacchon ke liye baithne ke liye naa to bench he naa hi mej
 Dirty mat laying on the ground and the next generation of Uttar Pradesh are trying to make their future golden in the soil
 skool main badahaal shiksha vyavasthashiksha kaa starjaanane ke liye ham kaksha aath main pahunche, chaatro se hamane kisi bhi paanch falon ke naam angreji main puche
 Even after working hard, the first student could not answer
 hamane duusare se poocha to jawaab santara or kelaa ke baad papite par galati ke saath khatm ho gaya
 In this class, we asked another student of class VIII the meaning of the book in English and its letters in English but the answer was not received
 aathvin kaksha kii ek ladki se hamane 17, 16 or 14 kaa pahaada bhi jaananaa chaha lekin jawaab nahin mila
 It was now boys' turn after girls in eighth grade
 angreji main paanch falon ke naam bhi sahi se nahin nikle
 However, in class a child was well versed in English with the letters of the names of the 5 body parts
 chhathi kaksha ke chaatraon ko hamane unheen kii angreji kii kitaab kaa pehla panna padhane ko kaha
 You would be surprised to know that in the whole class, only two children raised their hands, who considered themselves capable of reading the book
 or is tarah kii padhai ke tareekon par jab hamane shikshika mahoday se sawaal kiya to unka sawaal bhi behad golmol or kaam chalau tha
 In all, government schools in Kanpur and Unnao failed in the reality test
 uttar pradesh ke sarkari skulon main naa to buniyadi suvidhaayen hai or naa hi bacchon ke liye behatar shiksha ke intjaam
 
 aise main uttar pradesh kii agali peedi philhal andhkaar main najar aa rahi he

 unhone kaha ki is dauraan aise bhi naare lage ki 'modi-modi kahana hoga yaa pakistan main rahanaa hoga'
