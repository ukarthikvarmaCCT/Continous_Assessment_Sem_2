 Read: Birendra Singh had said, 'rajya Sabha seat gets in 100 crores', he said,' Nowadays, if nobody sees anything else, the best business is politics
 bijness main fail ho jaao, sarkari naukari main fail ho jaao, achche doctor na ban sako achche ejeeniyar naa ban sako, achche vakil naa ban sako to raajnneeti main pravesh kar jaao

 unhone kaha, ek baar kalakaaron ke chayan kaa kaam puraa ho jaae tab ham meri bivi kii bhoomika par dhyaan denge or phir isamen mere bhattije kaa bhi khaas kirdaar hoga
 There were many speculations about who would play the role of Amirki's daughters in the film, for which Kangana Ranot, Taapsee Pannu, Urvashi Rautela and many actresses were named in the media
 aamir ne kaha, hamane kai ladakiyon kaa audishan liya or phir fatima shaikh or sanya malhotra ko iske liye chunaa
 They are very good and very talented

 Input: PTI bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne 7 saal pehle 2010 main gujarat sarkaar se kosi baadh peediton ke liye mili 5 karod kii raahat raashi ko thukraa diya tha or is check ko gujarat sarkaar ko waapas kar diya tha
 7 years ago, Nitish Kumar was angry and the reason for his displeasure was an advertisement which appeared in the newspapers of Bihar
 bhaajapa ke is vigyaapan main is baat kaa zikr tha ki kis tareeke se gujarat kii narendra modi sarkaar ne bihar ke baadh peediton kii madad ke liye paanch karod kii raahat raashi di thi
 In 2010, Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 bhaajapa kaa yah vigyaapan nitish kumaar ko itnaa nagavar gujara ki unhone5 karod kii baadh raahat raashigujrat sarkaar ko waapas kar di thi
 Now after 7 years, Bihar is again facing the tragedy of floods and many state governments have extended a helping hand for Bihar

 On Thursday, Gujarat Revenue Minister Bhupendra Singh reached Patna with a check of 5 crores and handed over to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 lekin is baar gujarat se milipaanch karod rupye kii madadko nitish kumaar ne thukraayaa nahin balki saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 The only difference is that in 2010 Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat and today Vijay Rupani
 haalanki, gujarat se patna pahunche bhupendra singh check saunpane ke baad nitish kumaar par tanj kasnaa nahin bhuule
 Talking to 'aaj Tak', Bhupendra Singh said that he had a good meeting with Nitish Kumar and no one remembered the incident of 2010 when Nitish returned a check of Rs 5 crore
 bhupendra singh ne kaha ki 7 saalon main halaat bahut badal gaye hai or samay balavaan hota he
 Apparently, the Minister of Gujarat once again reminded Nitish Kumar that times are variable and he returned the check of 5 crores which he had given to the Gujarat Government 7 years ago, today the checks of 5 crores from the same Gujarat Government Had to accept them again
 aaj kii ghatana par argedy ke vidhayak bhai virendra ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne jo aaj 5 karod ke check ko phir se sweekaara he, ise thook kar chaatna kehete hai or yah bihar kii parampara nahin he

 'if an Indian ?, held patriotic, can advise a foreign nation where he works, to twist India's arm, is to be forgiven, then i suspend my demand — Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) June 23, 2016 Central government reposes trust in Arvind BJP also appeared to be very careful while clarifying Swamy's statement

 Naidu also said that BJP Secretary Shrikant Sharma said in a press conference held in New Delhi after Safai Swamy's demand for the removal of Arvind from the post, "does not agree with the party's statement
" yah puri tarah se unke nijee vichaar hai

 unhone kaha, 'BJP ne kuch nahin kaha
 The government did not say anything
 sawaal yah he ki loktantr main aap sabhi kaa munh nahin band kara sakate hai
 If the party says something, i can react to it
 agar sarkaar kuch kahati he, to main usapar pratikriya de saktaa hum

 aarthik mandi se kya loktantric aazaadiyon par khatra mandaraane lagata he?kya takat badhaane kii divaani sarkaron ko aarthik museebataan raas aati hai?loktantr main abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke liye mukt bazaar ko sikudne se bachaana kyon jaruri he?lokshahi main aazaadiyon se jude ye sabase tatke or nukile sawaal hai
 The new economics of democracy has been created in the past Bisec years, with the help of which the free market has prevented governments from becoming parents by promoting economic freedom
 khuli arthvyavastha ke saath sarkaron par janata kii nirbharta kam hoti chali gai, isliye netaa ab un maukon kii talash main hai jinke sahare aazaadiyon kii simit kiya ja sake
 Is Economic Recession an Enemy of Democracy? The report of Freedom House (the most prestigious institution to assess the authenticity of democracies) is "a reputable index of freedom in the world democracy
" 2018 kii report ke mutabik, loktantr pichley kai dashakon ke sabase gahare sankat se mukaabil he
 In 2107, political rights in 75 democracies (countries), freedom of the press, rights of minorities and rule of law weakened
 loktantr kii aazaadiyon main lagaataar giravat kaa yah 12waan saal he
 "freedom in the World" states that democracy has weakened in 112 countries in 12 years
 taanaashaahee vaale deshon kii taadaad 43 se badhkar 48 ho gai
 The bad days of democracies have gained momentum since 2008
 thik isi saal duniya main mandi shuru hui thi jo ab tak jari he
 After 1990, Surat and Sirat of democracies all over the world had improved
 achraj nahin ki thik isi samay duniya ke kai deshon main aarthik udaarikaran prarambh hua tha or global vikaas ko pankh lag gaye the
 That is, in the shadow of fast economic development, the independence flourished
 aarthik sankat se kise phayda?aarthik udaarikan or loktantr ke rishte dilachasp hai
 Wherever the market was freed and entrepreneurship gained independence, governments lost their strength, so as the recession shrinks the market and limits private entrepreneurship, governments have the opportunity to increase power
 taaja tajurbe bataate hai ki jo desh mandi se buree tarah ghire rahe hai, vahaan loktantr kii takat ghati he
 Governments increase power in two ways with the help of recession: One: During recession, the government intervenes in the free market from its treasury and becomes the largest investor
 bharat main 1991 se pehle tak sarkaar hi arthvyavastha kii sutaradhar thi
 Two: Due to economic challenges there is a decrease in employment in the market and governments start interfering deeply in the livelihood of the people
 to kya har netaa ko ek mandi chahie jisase vah daanveer or taqatvar ho sake?laachaar bazaar to abhivyakti bejaar!vigyapanon kii duniya se jude ek puraane mitra kissa sunaate the ki 2001 se 2005 ke dauraan akhabaaron or tivi ke paas saste sarkari vigyapanon ke liye jagah nahin hoti thi
 Advertisements getting from the market did not leave room for governments
 mandi kii sthiti main sarkaar sabase badi vigyaapak va prachaarak ho jaati he or aazaadee ko sikudsa padataa he
 "freedom in the World" reported in 2013 that press freedom in European countries weakened after the global recession
 khaastaur par europea samudaay ke mulkon main press kii aazaadee ke maamle main jinka record bejod rahaa heprasangvash, congress ke aadhikarik itihaaskaar pranab mukherjee ne likhaa he ki 1975 ke apatkaal kii prishthbhumi main 1973 ke tel sankat se upji mahangaai, bekaari, hadataalen or uske virodh main puure desh main foot pade andolan the, jisane rajnatik maahaul bigaad diya
 That is, there was recession and inflation behind the Emergency! By the way, now if the freedom is not completely banned by the government, then the governments would not kidnap the freedom as much as it did in the 1975 Indian Emergency
 aazaadiyon ko mukt bazaar or tej aarthik pragati chahie kyonki chatur sarkaron ne loktantr ke bheetar swadhinata ke apharan ke sookshm tareeke viksit kar liye hai
 Of course, the free market is not safe, but we have the government to manage it
 sarkaron kii nirankushta ko koun sanbhaalega? iske liye to unhen chota hi rakhana jaruri he
 *** raajnneeti main matbhed hona chahie kyonki usase samaadhaan nikalataa he lekin manabhed nahin hona chahie
 These things reached Jyotiraditya Scindia in Agenda Aaj Tak
 unhone kaha ki atal ji kaa unhone hameshaa sammaan kiya he kyonki wo achche insaan the
 Jyotiraditya Scindia further said that it is not right to compare Modi and Bajpai
 donon main koi samyata nahin he
 He did not see any PM who advised his CM to follow Rajdharma
 unki kisi se tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Bajpai was a good man
 aaj jis tarah kii raajnneeti ho gai he usamen achche insaan kii jarurat he na ki kootneetijna kii
 There are differences in democracy
 ham ekadusre kaa virodh bhi karte hai lekin manabhed nahin hona chahie
 Rajdeep Sardesai had asked him about the picture in which Jyotiraditya, former CM of MP Shivraj Singh Chauhan and MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath are seen greeting the public together
 aisi tasviir dilli main kyon nahin dikhaai detii
 Why does Modi and Sonia not sit together, why does Rahul and Modi not have such a thing
 is sawaal par sindhiya ne kaha ki ham matbhed rakhte hai lekin manabhed nahin rakhte
 Rahul Gandhi would not have held Modi's hand in Parliament if he had a different mind
 sindhiya ne kaha ki ham yah sweekaar karte hai ki hamaari jeet bahut badi nahin he, hamen 114 siten mili hai
 BJP has got 109 seats in MP
 bijepi ko congress se 1 fisadi zyada vot mili hai
 This is democracy and he congratulates SP and BSP as well as BJP mlas
 unka kahana tha ki ab chunaav ho chuke hai
 We have no discrimination with anyone
 sabhi ko saath lekar hi pradesh ko aage le janaa he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an MP from Varanasi
 varanasi ke bare main unhone kaha tha ki unhen vahaan maa ganga ne bulaayaa he
 Cleanliness of the Ganga is at the top of the Modi government's agenda
 sarkaar bani to ganga ke liye alag mantralay bhi bana, lekin 100 dinon baad kya-kuch badla? modi japan kii tarj par varanasi ko viksit karne kii baat karte hai, lekin kya maa kii seva main ek putr sahi disha main he? panchayat ajtak ke chauthe seshan 'svachh ganga, saaf suthra shahar' main inhen muddon par charchaa hui
 Included in the discussion were BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, water activist Rajendra Singh and Congress leader Subodh Kant Sahay
 sawaal: modi ne laal kile se swatchta kaa zikr kiya
 What is the government doing about Ganga? Manoj Tiwari: When there was talk of sanitation, toilets and Ganga from the ramparts of the Red Fort, i felt that a new India was being built
 rajendra singh (water activist):jab laal kile se swachha kii baat hui to bahut acha laga
 There is also a very strong law for cleanliness
 pichley 100 dinon main agar kanoon kaa thik se paalan hota to nadiyon kaa bhala hota
 Good to hear the way the Prime Minister of India talked about cleanliness
 lekin 100 dinon main kuch ho jaataa, kuch dikh jaataa to acha hota
 If Modi government is really worried about Ganga then implement the existing laws properly
 modi kah rahe hai ki ganga maa he
 But in 100 days he did nothing but talk to that mother
 manoj tiwari:kuch chizon ko dil kholkar dekhnaa chahie
 When did you first see that a PM had gone to Ganga after taking oath
 modi ji sirf fund dekar ganga saaf nahin karavaaenge, logon ko isse jodenge
 Subodh Kant Sahay: Ganga is the lifeline of our life
 ganga ko bhavatmak jodne ke liye piem kii jarurat nahin balki implimentation kii jarurat he
 Law is a different thing and its implementation is a different thing
 ganga kii swatchta barkaar rahe yah rajeev ji dwaara shuru kiya gaya
 Rajivji was the first to worry about cleaning the Ganges
 agar koi muslim ganga kii aarti nahin kare to ham yah nahin kah sakate ki wo ganga se judaa hua nahin he
 It is not right to show off just by religion
 manoj tiwari:ganga sabaki he
 Ganga does not belong to hindu-muslim
 subodh kaant sahay:main bhi yahi kah rahaa hum
 Ganga has 130 crore people
 sawaal: ham ganga ko lekar uthaae gaye kadamon kii baat kar rahe the
 Manoj Tiwari: Ganga is not just for worship
 ganga ko jis din ham hindu-muslim se upar uthaaenge tabhi kuch acha hoga or yahi kaam piem ne kiya

 pashchim bengal main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii politics nayaa mode leti ja rahi he
 The BJP has been aggressive in Bengal in such a way that it not only halved Mamata Banerjee's political strength within five years, but also brought herself closer to her in such a way from where she was able to smash Mamta Banerjee in 2021 Is also thinking about haalanki loksabhaa chunaav main badi haar ke baad bhi mamata banerjee ko apni usee politics par bharosa he
 On which she has been running for the last five years
 ye baat alag he ki isi politics main bijepi ko bengal main bada mauka mil gaya
 Nevertheless, Mamta Banerjee is constantly saying that she will continue this same politics after the results of May 23
 mamata banerjee ne ye bhi kaha ki jis samudaay ke vot unako milte hai unke paas wo sau baar jaaengi bhale hi koi kitna bhi un par tushtikaran ke aarope lagaataa rahe
 On Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee again challenged the BJP, saying that the one who collided with them will be crushed
 mamata banerjee kii ye aakraamak raajnneeti tab jari he
 When the BJP is busy sprinkling salt on their burns
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad mamata banerjee ke khilaaf jai shriram ke naare kii phir se muhim shuru ho gai
 But Mamta Banerjee has already said that she will not surrender to BJP
 aakhir aisa kya he ki mamata banerjee kii jis raajnneeti kii vajah se bengal main bijepi ko mauka mila, or use bengal main hindutv kii raajnneeti ko dhar mil gai
 Despite this, Mamata Banerjee is not ready to step out of her political line
 ise bengal main muslim voton ke sameekaran se samajha ja saktaa he
 The India today-axis My India post poll survey shows that Muslim population is 14% of the total population of the country, but this figure is 28% which is double the total population of Bengal
 india today-exis maai india ke post pole survey ke mutabik is chunaav main pashchim bengal main 63% muslim voter trinmul congress (tiemasi) kii taraf gaye
 The Congress got 14 percent and the Left got 9 percent Muslim votes
 vahiin 2014 ke chunaav ke vishleshan main ye saamne aayaa ki tiemasi ke muslim samudaay main 40%, left ko 30% or congress ko 20% vot mili the
 That is, Mamata Banerjee united the Muslim votes completely in her favor, moving away from the Congress and the Left, which benefited her in the 2016 elections, and in 2019 she won 22 seats
 pashchim bengal kii kareeb 9 loksabhaa siten aisi hai jahaan par muslim aabaadi 30 fisadi se bhi zyaada he
 There are about 125 seats in the Assembly of West Bengal, where Muslim voters are decisive
 dilachasp baat ye he ki 2016 ke chunaav main in 125 siton main mamata banerjee ne banpar 90 siten jiti thim
 That is, Mamata Banerjee's strategy seems to be that she will completely unite the Muslim votes, and retain her staunch supporters
 to ye 2021 ke chunaav main unki raajnneeti ko paar laga saktaa he
 Mamta Banerjee says that if you guys are together then how do we fight in every battle
 ham ladenge darane kii baat nahin
 Whatever anyone says, let me say, whatever anyone says
 hamen dekhnaa he kehane kii baat se nahin dil kii baat se kamyaabi karke dikhaaenge
 There is nothing to fear
 muddai lakh bura chaahe to kya hota he vahi hota he jo manjuure khuda hota he
 In fact, it is a fight for power to strengthen its electoral agenda for Bengal before 2021, with Mamata Banerjee on one side and Team Modi on the other
 yahi vajah he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aane ke turant baad se taiyaari donon taraf se shuru ho gai
 The interesting thing is that both BJP or Mamta Banerjee did not change their political line
 donon ko lagata he ki isi raste par unako jeet milegi
 Mamta Banerjee has embarked on a strategy to unify the Muslim vote bank in West Bengal
 iskaa phayda bhi unhen is chunaav main hua he
 When more than 60 percent of the Muslim votes went to his party and the Muslim votes were less towards the Congress and the Left
 isse mamata banerjee ko utana nuksaan nahin hua jitna nuksaan bijepi kar sakati thi
 It still managed to save 22 seats out of 42
 lekin mamata banerjee ke liye mushkil ye he ki unki is raajnneeti se bijepi ko bengal main bada mauka mila he
 The politics of Hindutva has got a torrent, let us tell you the statistics of the country where the Muslim population is more than the average
 aise 90 jilon main bijepi ne is baar aadhi se zyaada loksabhaa siten jiti hai
 The BJP has won 41 Lok Sabha seats this time out of 79 seats with an above average Muslim population
 bijepi ko bengal main mila phaaydaisamen sabase zyaada bijepi ko pashchim bengal main phayda hua, jahaan usne 18 loksabhaa siten jeetin
 In Raiganj seat of Uttar Dinajpur district, the Muslim population is close to 49 percent, BJP won this seat by 60 thousand votes
 20 fisadi muslim aabaadi vaali jalpaigudi seat par bijepi ne tiemasi ko ek lakh 84hazaar vot se haraaya
 The BJP defeated TMC by a margin of around 84 thousand in Malda North seat with 50 percent Muslim population
 kuchbihar seat jahaan muslim aabaadi 30 fisadi ke kareeb he vahaan bijepi ne tiemasi ko 54 hazaar vot se haraaya
 Similarly, BJP has won Balurghat, Bishnupur, Hooghly, burdwan-durgapur Lok Sabha seats where the Muslim population is above average
 ab bengal kii raajnneeti main jai shriram, jai maa kaali, jai hind, jai bangla vaali ladaai hi chal rahi he
 This is the game between BJP and TMC to beat each other
 donon ke paas do saal kaa vakt he jisamen bijepi ne mamata banerjee kii raajnneeti ko 2021 main dharashayi karne or mamata banerjee ne bengal main bijepi ke siyaasi kadam ko vidhansabha ke liye rokane main puraa jor laga diya he

 4 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, JDS is fighting hard for the role of Kingmaker
 bijepi bies yediurppa ke chehre ke sahare karnataka main camel khilaane kii aas lagaae hue hai
 Along with Yeddyurappa, the stronghold of the BJP and the Sangh is considered to be a stronghold of coastal Karnataka (coastal region)
 karnataka main bijepi or aresas kii hindutv kii prayogshaala isi costal belt main he
 The BJP had to bear the brunt of Yeddyurappa's rebellion in the last election in coastal Karnataka
 vahiin congress ko isi kaa phayda mila tha
 Now that Yeddyurappa is again the ruler of the BJP and the party is busy in the political politics of Hindutva
 aise main tateey karnataka kshetra main chunavi muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 Mangaluru, Udupi and Karwar Chikmagalur districts cover about 20 assembly seats under the coastal Karnataka region
 centre sarkaar main mantri or karnataka bijepi ke firebrands netaa anant kumaar hegade karwaar jile se aate hai
 Five-time MP Hegde is identified as the face of Hindutva in the state
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko yediurppa kaa alag hokar chunaav ladanaa mahangaa padaa tha
 The party suffered heavily
 congress ko pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke is majboot durg se 13 siten mili thim
 Whereas BJP had got only 3 seats
 vot share ke maamle main congress ko 43 fisadi vot mili the jabaki bijepi ko 34 fisadi, jedies ko 9 or anya ko 13 fisadi vot mili the
 Only a year after the assembly elections, did Yeddyurappa return to BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party performed very well
 party ke costal kshetra main kareeb 55 fisadi vot mili, jabaki congress ko 3 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or use 40 fisadi vot mili
 Only the entire vote of JDS went to BJP
 jedies ko mahaj 0
 Got 3 percent votes
 2014 ke matdaan pattern ko vidhansabha kshetra ke maddenjar dekha jaae to bijepi 17 vidhansabha siton par aage rahi, jabaki congress keval 3 siton par aage rahi he
 BJP is desperate to repeat the performance in the assembly elections on the lines of Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki anant hegade se lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke jariye bijepi ne is ilaake main hindutv card khelaa he
 It is very difficult for the Congress to repeat the results of the last election
 yahi vajah he ki siddharmaiya dakshini karnataka ke saath-saath uttar karnataka kii seat par kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Through this, they are trying to resolve both areas
 ajtak ne pulavama aatanki hamale or bharat kii airstrike ke baad rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par khaas kaarykram 'suraksha sabha' kaa aayojan kiya, jisamen sarkaar or vipaksh ke diggaj netaaon ne shirkat kii

 is dauraan donon netaaon ne apni-apni partiyon kaa paksh rakhaa or rafel deal or rashtriya suraksha se jude kai muddon par apni baat rakhi
 On the Rafael Deal issue, Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that the issue of 1 lakh 76 thousand crore symbolic loss on the 2G scam has been dismissed from the court and it proved to be an illusion of falsehood
 isi ko bunakar bijepi 2014 ke chunaav se pehle jhooth or fareb kii raajnneeti kar rahi thi, lekin yah zyada dinon tak chalane vaali nahin he
 He said that the trial in the Rafale case is still going on in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar ne 126 vimaanon ke saude ko isliye khaarij kiya kyonki aap apane puunjipati dost, dhanapashu ko phayda pahunchaana chaahate the, ofaset sauda aise dhanapashu ko diya jise jahaaj banane kaa koi anubhav nahin tha
 For this, HAL, an indigenous company that made aircraft like Tejas, was sidelined
 yah rashtriya suraksha par aapaki manshaa ko saaf darshata he
 Rafael would have come earlier
 
 
 rafel main deree ke sawaal par tiwari ne kaha ki murali manohar joshi ne kaha tha, rashtriya suraksha par kharch usee str par he jo 1962 main tha
 BC Khanduri, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Security, said that in the last four years national security is being weakened in a very cohesive manner
 ye donon hi congress ke sadsy nahin balki bijepi ke bade netaa hai
 If the government had seen the noting of former Defense Minister AK Antony on Rafale, these ships would have come to India in 2014 itself
 lekin aapane 126 jahaaj kii kharid kii prakriya ko radd kar 36 kar diya
 Targeting pak's biggest injury to Congress, Manish Tiwari said that we do not need a certificate from anyone on national security, the biggest injury to Pakistan was by someone, it was the Congress government and Pakistan was divided into two Was divided
 1971 se 2014 tak ham rashtriya suraksha par katibaddh rahe
 But we never politicized it, because we were a responsible government
 tiwari ne kaha ki 2017 main pehali baar sargical strike nahin hui, 1998 se lagaataar par seemaa par aisi karrwai hoti rahi he
 On Rahul Gandhi's statement on Masood Azhar, Manish Tiwari said that serious issues of national security should not be diverted from this
 unhone jaavdekar par patalwaar karte hue kaha kya sarkaar ne janata se kiye gaye vaadon ko puraa kiya he
 Did the government give 15 lakhs, did it give 2 crore jobs annually, did the government give correct figures on Mudra loans
 is vajah se agar sarkaar maanati he ki unhone vaade puure kiye hai to vah janata ke bich jaae, lekin ham bhi janata ke bich apane sawaal rakhenge or janata is par bhi apana faisla degi

 kai purv cricketer or khilaadi bhale hi sachin tendulkar ko rajyasabha sadsy manonith karne ke faisle kaa swaagat kar rahe hon lekin purv cricketer sanjay manjrekar kaa kahana he ki vah master blaster ke sarkaar kaa prastaav sweekaar karne ke faisle par hairaan hai
 Manjrekar, who has played with Sachin, is not the only one to have this view, many others have also supported Manjrekar's point and he says that Tendulkar is not known for expressing his views on public issues
 tendulkar ke bare main pratikriya poochne par manjrekar ne kaha, ‘asal main main is khabar se hairaan hum
 First of this nomination, because it happened suddenly without prior knowledge
 or sachin kaa is prastaav ko sweekaar karnaa zyada hairaani bharaa he
 Manjrekar said, "when i see what Sachin can do after he retires, i thought that maybe he was involved with some cricket, coaching and then some other work or social activities
" lekin sanyas ke baad yaa kariyar ke is str par rajyasabha sadsy bananaa kuch aisa he jiske bare main main koi anumaan nahin laga saktaa tha
 Manjrekar, however, said that if Tendulkar wishes, he can participate in the proceedings in Parliament
 unhone kaha, ‘ab vah bharat ke sabhi maichon main nahin khelte hai
 He does not play for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy
 agar vah samay nikaalnaa chaahate hai to vah aisa kar sakate hai or log bhi aisi hi ummid karte hai
 He will not go to every session of Parliament every day
 vah paryaapt samay to nikaal sakate hai
 'manjrekar said, but i am completely surprised by this
 main unhen ek khaas tarah ke vyakti ke taur par jaanata hum
 He said that it would be a different challenge for Sachin as he is calm by nature and he does not even react to cricket related issues
 cricket camentrator or vishleshak harsha bhogale kaa maananaa he ki tendulkar ke paas ek sakriy saansad banane kaa anubhav nahin he
 Bhogle said, 'many people are now trying to benefit from Tendulkar
 mujhe nahin pataa ki kya yah acha vichaar he
 If there is an idea to honor Sachin by giving him a seat in the Rajya Sabha, it is fine, but if you want to see Tendulkar as an active MP and focusing on social issues, then he has no experience for this

 If there is a system in the country, then something will happen, otherwise the students have said that their ragging has not taken place

 In the opinion of such rare scholars, immorality in our society is more prestigious than morality, but the Medical Council of India has sent a letter to Saifai Medical College and expressed dissatisfaction over the behavior of the college on this issue of Wrangling

 Why should not every senior be fined one lakh
 council ne kaha he ki 150 medical chaatro kii raging hui he to is hisaab se 150 yani dedh karod kii fine senior se vasuuli jaae
 Till such strictures do not occur, the cruel stories of ragging will not come out or end in the basement of medical colleges
 yahaan tak ki jab ziladhikari ne jaanch team bheji to pratham varsh ke chaatro ne inkaar kar diya
 Even after this, the District Magistrate has sent the same report to Lucknow that there has been an attempt to hide the ragging
 yah saamaanya ghatana nahin he
 There is not such a small incident that any edge should be placed
 ummid he ki kalege ke senior apni aadaton main sanshodhan karenge or samajhenge ki unhone kya kiya he
 At this time, they should not worry about the lobbying recommendation and honestly think what makes them think of doing so
 kya 150 junior chaatro ke sir munda dene se acha doctor banaata he
 On the other hand, questions are being raised about the process of arrest of former Finance Minister p Chidambaram
 subah das baje unase poochtacha shuru hui or paune do baje tak chalati rahi
 CBI officer r Parthasarathy was questioning him
 uske baad unhen chaar baje ke kareeb sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke justise ajay kumaar ke chember main pesh kiya gaya
 Here CBI counsel Padmini Singh argued and in response Kapil Sibal, Vivek Tankha and Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued
 solicytor general tushaar mehta ne bhi sarkaar kii taraf se bahes kii
 The CBI counsel said Chidambaram was not cooperating in the investigation
 anya aropiyon ke saath aamane-saamne bitha kar poochtacha karnaa zaruri he
 He has not given the documents he has asked for Chidambaram
 sibiai ne kaha ki is cese kii jaanch chargeshit taiyaar karne se pehle ke charan main hai kyonki unhen kuch or dastauez chahie
 The CBI also said that this is a case of classic money laundering
 poochtacha se hi sari jaankaree mil paaegi
 The CBI lawyer said that he is ready to give the case diary and also handed over the diary to the court
 agyaat adhikariyon ne apni haisiyat kaa galat istamaal kiya he or indrani mukherjee ne 50 lakh dollar dene kii baat maani he
 The CBI also said that Indrani Mukherjee has given a statement that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board approval was violated which was demanded by Karti Chidambaram for a million dollars which was accepted by Peter Mukherjee and Indrani Mukherjee
 
 indrani mukherjee is cese main sarkari gavaah ban gai hai
 CBI seeks 5 days remand
 iske baad chidambaram ke vakil kapil sibbal or abhishek manu singhvi ne unka paksh rakhaa
 Kapil Sibal said that in this case, co-accused Karthi Chidambaram got bail on 23 March 2018
 isi court se ek or aaropee chartd acountint bhaskar raman ko agrim zamaanat di gai he
 The other accused Indrani Mukherjee and Peter Mukherjee are also on the default bail
 sibbal ne kaha ki hoicourt ke faisle se lagata he ki draft chargeshit taiyaar he or jaanch puri ho gai he
 6 secretaries approved FIPB in INX, no arrests were made
 is maamle main 10 saal baad cese darj hua he
 Chidambaram never ran away from questioning
 agar sawaalon se batch rahe hai to court main rakhe sibiai
 Today 12 questions were asked, of which six were asked in June itself
 chidambaram jawaab bhi de chuke hai
 There is only one day inquiry
 sibiai chaahati to phir se bula sakati thi
 Even today, from the arrest till 12 o'clock in the morning, the CBI did not make any inquiry while Chidambaram kept speaking for questioning
 agar paisa mila he to wo kisi acount main gaya hoga, wo acount kahaan he
 Who gave the money paanch million dollar diya gaya he to kahaan par diya gaya he
 CBI is repeatedly asking the same question
 court main chidambaram kii patni nalini chidambaram or unke bete kaarati chidabanram bhi maujuud the
 Chidambaram said that he has not taken any money
 meraa videsh main koi acount nahin he
 The son has an account abroad which the CBI knows and has answered every question
 sibbal ne kaha ki videshi fund kii manzuri 6 sachiv milakar dete hai, unamem se kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 This case is the basis of the documents
 sachivon ne vitt mantri ke paas bheja or unhone manzuri di
 Ten years later the FIR has taken place
 2017 ke baad unase kabhi bhi poochtacha ho sakati thi
 Not done
 sibiai ne koi patr tak nahin likhaa ki amuk dastavej chahie
 Why did the CBI not do this
 yah sab sibbal chidambaram kii taraf se bol rahe the
 Sibbl said that the decision on the surety for seven months was reserved
 jis tarah se abhiyukt ke saath vyavhaar ho rahaa he usase gambhir etraz he
 Whatever is written in the case diary is not evidence
 is cese kaa saboot se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Has to do with something else
 sibbal ke baad abhishek manu singhvi ne bahes kii
 Singhvi said that the entire case is based on the statement and case diary of Indrani Mukherjee
 indrani mukherjee ke bayaan darj hone ke chaar maheene baad chidambaram ko bulaayaa gaya
 Indrani Mukherjee has been made an official witness to arrest
 2018 main bayaan diya tha uske aadhaar par indrani 2019 main sarkari gavaah baniin
 The entire CBI argument rests on Chidambaram not answering
 kya sahyog nahin karne ke aadhaar par police remand maanga janaa sahi he
 Singhvi said that one of the six secretaries approved was made Governor of the Reserve Bank
 chidambaram ne to maatr farren investment pramotion board ke 6 sachivon main prastaav bheja or chidambaram ne manzuri di
 He was not charged with tampering with evidence
 jaanch angesi ke paas majboot cese nahin he
 There was no response from the prosecution as to why no action has been taken against the 6 secretaries who had approved foreign investment, why one of them was appointed as Governor of the Reserve Bank
 ye di subba raav kii baat ho rahi he, jo reserve bank ke governor bane
 They have also been questioned by the CBI on 14 April 2018
 sibbl or singhvi kii bahes ke baad solisitor general tushaar mehta ne phir bahes kii
 He said that we are dealing with an accused who apologizes for not answering
 abhi jaanch chal rahi he
 We gave an affidavit in front of the High Court
 unase poochtacha zaruri he
 The prosecution will not reveal all its questions and has the right to ask
 indrani mukherjee or peter mukherjee, shina vora kii hatya ke maamle main aaropee hai or jail main hai
 Sheena was Indrani's daughter who went missing in 2012
 baad main pataa chalaa ki uski hatya ho gai he
 Indrani Mukherjee was arrested in 2015 and Peter Mukherjee was also arrested
 kya unke kisi or cese main gavaah ban jane par unki baat kaa itnaa vazan hoga ki chidambaram ko giraftaar kiya jaae
 This question is being repeatedly raised by the Congress
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki ham intellegent aadmi ke saath nipat rahe hai
 this is good
 chidambaram intellegent hai
 Therefore, they should also go to jail
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha he ki kanoon kii baat nahin kar rahi hum magar kai baar prakriya galat ho jaati he
 Chidambaram is a senior leader

 rajasthan ke skulon main daadi-nani aaengi bacchon ko apni kahaniyaan sunaane
 Education Department issued orders to make children sanskarwan
 daadi-nani se kahaniyaan ab bachche apane skulon main suna karengen
 The education department of the Rajasthan government has prepared a report, according to which a child's grandmother or grandmother will be called to school every month to make the children sanskaran and will tell stories to all the children
 India's Best College For Science: bengalooru kii ye uniwarsity he number 1iske liye shiksha vibhaag ne ek order jari kiya he
 According to this, all the government schools from class 1 to 5 will hold a child meeting on the last Saturday of the month, in which the grandmother and grandmother will come and tell their stories
 shiksha vibhaag ke upanideshak arun kumaar sharma ke anusaar hamane pichley saptaah se sabhi skulon ko is babat suchit karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The thinking behind this is that social behavior and behavior should increase among children and children become family
 ek duusare se jude rahen
 Because the stories of grandmothers and grandmothers used to have very sweet taste, which taught them something
 isse bachche to sanskari to banenge hi saath hi unki budhimata bhi badhegi
 According to a report by the National Law School of India University, Bangalore, the Department of Education, in fact, 80 per cent of the children are engrossed in TV and electronic gazette throughout the day so that their social development is not happening properly
 bachapan main jab bachche sone jate the to daadi-nani se kahaniyaan sunati thim
 But nowadays neither children nor family have any time for this
 ise lagu karne se bacchon kaa vikaas to hoga hi ghar par rah rahe bujurgon ko bhi bacchon ke saath samay bitaakar acha lagegaa
 These people also tell stories better
 nutrishan science padhaane vaale 10 top instituteiske liye shiksha vibhaag kahaniyon kaa ek sample bhi degaa, jiske aadhaar par skool main aane vaale bujurg apni kahaniyaan sunaayenge
 No additional money will be spent in this work of the Education Department
 skool ke teacher bacchon ke ghar jaakar unki daadi-nani ko skool aakar kahaniyaan sunaane ke liye prerit karenge

 During this time there was a heated debate between Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan cricketers on the field
 srilankai khilaadiyon kaa kahana tha ki aakhri over kii shuruaati donon genden kandhe se upar thim or field ampire ne no-ball nahin diya 
 Later commentary Sunil Gavaskar said that the ball was definitely above the shoulder, but came down from the batsman's helmet
 sanjay manjrekar ne bhi bangladesh ke captain shaakib al hasan ke aacharan ko lekar apni naaraazgi jaahir kii he
 Finally, the team manager of Bangladesh, Khalid Mehmood, played an important role in ending this event which lasted for five minutes
 unke samajhane ke baad shaakib ne apane khilaadiyon ko khilne ke liye bheja
 If the Bangladeshi batsmen did not go for batting, the team would be disqualified from the tournament and Sri Lanka would have reached the final

 Amarinder Singh (@capt_amarinder)july 16, 2019 a Delhi court has termed premarital sex as 'immoral' and 'against every religious opinion', stating that every act of sexual intercourse for two adults on the basis of a promise to marry does not constitute rape
 atirikt satr nyaayadhish virendra bhat ne yah bhi kaha ki koi mahila, visheshkar vayask, shikshit or karyaalay jane vaali ho, jo vivaah ke aashwaasan par yon sansarg karti he to aisa 'vah apane jokhim par karti' he
 The judge said, "in my opinion, every act of sexual act between two adults on the assurance of marriage does not become an offense if the boy later does not fulfill this promise
" unhone kaha, 'jab ek vayask, shikshit or offis jane vaali mahila vivaah karne ke aashwaasan par khud ko apane mitra yaa sahyogi ke prati younachaar ke liye samarpit karti he to vah aisa apane jokhim par karti he
 He should understand about this act and also know that there is no guarantee that the boy will fulfill his promise 
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, vah aisa kar bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 She should understand that she is indulging in an act which is not only immoral but also against the rules of every religion
 duniya kaa koi bhi dharm vivaah se pehle younachaar kii anumati nahin detaa he
 The court made this remark while acquitting this man, who works in a multinational company, on rape charges
 police ne punjab nivasee 29 varshiya yuvak ko is mahila dwaara shikaayat darj karaane ke ek maheene baad giraftaar kiya tha
 This woman was doing administrative work in a private company
 mahila ne may 2011 main is yuvak ke khilaaf balaatkaar ke aarope main shikaayat darj karaayi thi
 The woman had alleged in her complaint that in July 2006, the youth came in contact with the internet through the website and after this, the accused made several physical connections with her, promising to get married
 shikaayat ke anusaar jab 2008 main vah garbhvatee ho gai to is yuvak ne usase vivaah karne kii bajaae us par garbhpaat karaane kaa dabaav daalaa or kaha ki uski bahanon kii shaadi ho jane ke baad vah usase vivaah kar legaa
 The woman also told the police that she did not marry him despite her sisters being married
 isaki bajaay usne or uske mata-pita ne use gaaliyaan deen or uskaa utpeedan kiya
 But the accused, during the trial of the case, opposed the woman's claim and said that they became friends through social networking and would meet occasionally thereafter, but she never had sex with her
 adaalat ne is yuvak ke kathith kathan kaa sangyaan lete hue kaha ki mahila ke paas naitikta ko samajhane or uske krity ke parinaam ko samajhane kii budhimatta he
 Therefore, there is no possibility of misleading the young man by giving him any kind of confidence
 adaalat ne kaha ki record main aisa koi saboot nahin he, jisase yah pataa chale ki usne baad main shaadi karne ke vaayade ke aadhaar par hi younachaar ke liye sahmati di anyathaa vah iske liye apni rajamandi nahin detii
 The judge said, 'I understand that it is not appropriate for a girl to engage in sexual acts with a boy merely by saying that he is going to be her husband and indulge in sexual acts with her Neither is evil
 aisi paristhiti main ladki ko hi aise krity ke achche bure pahalu par vichaar karnaa hoga or phir use faisla karnaa chahie ki use apana sharir ladke ke hawaale karnaa chahie yaa nahin
 ' adaalat ne kaha ki vah khud bhi peedita ke is kathan se santusht nahin he ki use vivaah ke vaayade par gumraah kiya gaya or isi ke bharose usne yuvak ke saath younachaar kii sahmati di

 Osama bin Laden, the world's most feared terrorist, had a good childhood and early life
 vah padhane-likhane main hoshiyaar or behad sharmila ladkaa tha
 By the age of 20, he had nothing to do with terror
 yah baat laden kii maa aalia ghanem ne bataai
 Ghanem, who came to the media for the first time nearly seven years after the death of Al Qaeda kingpin, said that when Osama bin Laden was studying Economics at King Abdullaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he came in contact with some people who had his brainwash done
 iske baad wo kattarpanth or aatank kii raah par chalane laga
 After this, it became the world's most dreaded terrorist, who was killed by the US in 2008 in Pakistan
 'da gargian' akhbaar ko die intervyuu main ghanem ne bataaya ki jab laden 20 saal kaa tha, tab vah behad taqatvar or dil kaa acha insaan tha, lekin baad main wo achaanak badal gaya tha
 While studying at King Abdullaziz University in Jeddah, Laden became a radical
 laden ke janm ke kuch samay baad ghanem ne apane pehle pati se talaak le liya or duusari shaadi kar lee thi
 They now have a family
 laden kii maut ko itnaa samay biit chukaa he, lekin ghanem ko aaj bhi usko yaad karti hai
 She says that Laden was his first child and he was very shy
 laden unase bahut zyada pyaar karata tha
 Ghanem still holds the picture of Osama bin Laden wearing a uniform
 ghanem kaa kahana he ki king abdullajeej uniwarsity main padhai ke dauraanaladenki mulaakaat abdulla ajaam naam ke ek shaks se hui, jo muslim brotherhud kaa sadsy tha, jise saudi arab se nirvasit kar diya gaya tha or baad main vah osama kaa dharmaguru bana
 He told that the people of the university had replaced Laden and he became a different kind of man
 jab ghanem se poocha gaya ki kya unako kabhi aisa mahasoos hua ki unka betaa laden jihadi ban jayega, to unhone kaha, 'yah mere dimag main kabhi nahin aayaa
 When we came to know that Laden had become a terrorist, we were very sad
 main nahin chaahati thi ki yah kisi or ke saath ho
 Why did he ruin everything like this
 ' ghanem ne laden ko aakhri baar saal 1999 main afghanistan main dekha tha or usase do baar milane gai thim
 At that time Osama was staying in his hideout just outside Kandahar
 osama bin laden 1980 ke dashak main rus ke kabje ke khilaaf ladaai ladane ke liye afghanistan pahunchaa tha
 Hasan, son of Ghanem and her second husband, says that whoever met Laden in the beginning respected him very much
 pehle hamako bhi us par garv hota tha
 Even the Saudi government had a good relationship with him, but then later his face of terror was revealed and everything changed
