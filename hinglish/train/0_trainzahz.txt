 Kerry's remarks came days after the US spoke out in support of freedom of expression against Amnesty International in Bangalore for treason charges
 kerri ne dilli sthit iaiti main kaha, 'america or bharat ko hamaare loktantric mulyon main vishwaas rakhana hoga or us swatantraaa ko barkaraar rakhana hoga jo hamaare deshon ko paribhaashit karti he
 'he said that all must protect the rights of all our citizens without considering the caste, language or community of our citizens
 kerri ne yah baat aatankwaad ke mul kaaran par prahaar karne kii jarurat par bolte hue kahi or yah bhi kaha ki yah alag alag deshon main bhinn he
 He said, 'so that they can express their views in a peaceful manner without fear of retribution or vengeance or fear of being jailed
 ' unhone haalanki yuvaaon main niraashaa ke liye bhrashtachar or kushasan ko mukhya kaaran main se ek bataaya
 Kerry said, "we have to work together and in harmony so that there is no escape for terrorists, no hiding place and no place for our future planning or preparation
" ' unhone kaha ki kisi ko bhi aatankwaadiyon ko safal nahin hone dena chahie or uske mul kaaran par prahaar karnaa jaruri he
 The comments kerri ne kaha ki jo samaaj apane nagarikon ko samaan maukey nahin detaa vah unhen ek sambhavit ativaadee yaa aatankwaadi bana detaa he
 He said, 'therefore it also means that we have to build bridges of tolerance, acceptance, compassion, mutual understanding between every religion and community

 He, however, cited corruption and misrule as one of the main reasons for the disappointment among the youth
 kerri ne kaha, 'hamen milakar or sadbhaav se kaam karnaa hoga, jisase ki aatankwaadiyon ke liye bhaagane kii koi jagah na ho, chhipane kii koi jagah na ho or apana bhavishya kii yojana athwa taiyaari ke liye koi jagah nahin ho

 ) Social activist Anna Hazare is all set for a three-day fast in Mumbai from Tuesday to demand an effective Lokpal Bill
 udhar sarkaar ne unke is anshan ko asamyik qaraar dete hue kaha ki vidheyak ke swaroop par antim nirnay sansad karegi
 Accusing the government of not being serious in the Lokpal case, social worker Anna Hazare said on Monday that he would go on a three-day fast in Mumbai from Tuesday

 Meanwhile, the political class continued to attack Team Anna
 lok janashakti party ke pramukh ramvilas paswan ne anna ke andolan ko 'bheedtantr' kii sangya se vibhooshit kiya
 Paswan has probably launched the most harsh attack after Lalu Prasad Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 yadav ne sansad main bahes ke dauraan team anna par nishaanaa saadhaa tha

 "anna told reporters in her native village," What anti-corruption law did you enact in 60 years of independence? Right to Information Act
 
 We had to fight for 10 years
 " anna ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko eemaandaar qaraar dete hue sonia or rahul par baar-baar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 On the other hand, Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said on Monday that the government is aware of the disagreement points of the Lokpal Bill proposed by social activist Anna Hazare but the final form of this bill will be decided by the Parliament
 mukherjee ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, "ham jaanate hai ki aise kuch bindu hai lekin vidheyak kii aakhri surat kya hogi yah sansad hi tay karegi
 "meanwhile, the government termed Anna's fast as untimely and said that the creation of anti-corruption law should be left to the discretion of Parliament
 sansadeey kaary rajya mantri rajeev shukla ne somvaar ko kaha, "sarkaar ne pehle hi prabhaavshaalee evam majboot vidheyak lok sabha main pesh kar diya he
 Everyone will participate in it
 raajnneetik dalon ke vichaar bhi saamne aaenge or vidheyak ko matdaan ke liye rakhaa jayega
 "he said," leave Parliament to decide on this
 main unase keval itnaa hi nivedan karnaa chaahunga ki sansad ke nirnay kaa intjaar karen

 He said, "the government is betraying the people
 ham sansad se haath jodakar shashakt lokapal vidheyak paarit karne kaa nivedan kar rahe hai
 "anna Hazare will move to Delhi after a three-day fast in Mumbai where he will launch the nationwide 'jail Bharo' movement
 ullekhneey he ki is saal anna hajaare kaa yah chauthaa anshan hoga
 He had his first fast in April, after which the Lokpal became the subject of national discussion

 Both were arrested and produced in juvenile court on Monday morning
 samaajawaadee dangal kaa parinaam aa chukaa he
 The Election Commission has considered Akhilesh as the Sultan
 ab samaajawaadee party akhilesh ke ishaaron par chalegi
 Akhilesh has been declared the authorized national president of the party
 chunaav ayog hi nahin yadav parivaar ne bhi akhilesh kii satta sweekaar kar lee he
 After the Election Commission's decision, it has been decided in the grand meeting of the family that all the debates will end and everyone will be engaged in the election
 janata main majboot samaajawaadee party kaa sandesh dena he
 Mulayam Singh has appealed to everyone to get back to power
 vivaad ne akhilesh ko banaaya jananayakasamaajawaadee party main pichley kaaphi samay se chal rahe vivaad ne janata ke bich akhilesh kii chhavi jananaayak kii bani he
 There is a discussion of family dispute in place of development in the entire state sabhi kii jubaan par he ki akhilesh ke haathon main satta saunp deni chahie
 The same happened with Akhilesh now
 ummid jataai ja rahi he ki akhilesh samaajawaadee party ko nai disha denge hi saath hi saath sakaaratmak raajnneeti kii ek misaal kaayam karenge
 Akhilesh's dominance in the party also increased Akhilesh's dominance within the family during the family dispute also appeared to be increasing
 chunaav ayog ke samaksh akhilesh ke daawey main tamaam sapa netaaon ke affidavit bhi jamaa karwaae gaye the
 The documents presented by Ram Gopal to the Election Commission were signed by 11 Rajya Sabha mps and 4 Lok Sabha mps
 iske alaava party ke 228 vidhayakon main se 195 vidhayakon kaa akhilesh ke samarthan main hastakshar tha
 Affidavits of 48 out of 68 mlcs were in favor of Akhilesh
 affidavit main kaha gaya tha ki sabhi ne 1 janvari 2017 ko hue rashtriya adhiveshan main shaamil the
 Mulayam's politics of five decades Now in almost five decades of Akhilesh's politics, Mulayam saw many ups and downs
 1991 ke baad sapa or mulaayam kaa graph teji se badhata gaya
 Mulayam, who tried his wrestling stakes in politics, got his first job, but his son Akhilesh himself
 akhilesh ne saaf sandesh de diya he ki ab yuva josh kii baari he
 By giving amar-shivpal the power over 'bicycle' to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the Election Commission has in a way recognized their special session
 iskaa matlab hua ki us adhiveshan main jo bhi faisle liye gaye sabhi sahi the
 In such a situation, Amar Singh automatically got out of the SP and Shivpal Yadav's political status was taken away
 shivpal philvakt sapa main maatr ek sadsy hai
 While Mulayam Singh Yadav will start a new innings as the patron of the party
 ramgopal, naresh, kiranmay kii balle-ballokhilesh yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh kaa pad milane ke baad sapa ke sansthaapak adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav dwaara pro
 The expulsions of Ram Gopal Yadav, Kiranmay Nanda and Naresh Aggarwal were also canceled automatically
 darasal, in teenon saansadon ko rashtriya adhiveshan ke baad mulaayam ne party se nikaal diya tha
 Now Ram Gopal will be seen as the national advisor to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav
 gathbandhan taychunaav ayog ke faisle ke baad yah saaf ho chukaa he ki akhilesh jald hi gathbandhan par apana faisla le lenge
 It is believed that due to the family riots, the Samajwadi Party will try to cross the electoral sea, sitting on the coalition's background
 akhilesh yadav khud congress or anya dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladane kii baat kar chuke hai
 According to sources, the blueprint for the alliance between the Congress and SP has been prepared
 kuch vidhansabha siton par baat ataki thi jinpar baat antim daur main he
 Formal announcements can be made in a day or two
 gathbandhan se majboot hoga muslimon kaa bharosouttar pradesh main muslim vot 19 fisadi he jo kaaphi nirnaayak hota he
 In the last election, the Muslim vote was the hand of the sp's overwhelming majority, while in Maya's majority, the Brahmin vote was matched with the Dalit
 pichley dinon sapa main chhide dangal se muslim matadaata thodaa sanshay main tha
 An alliance for the SP was also necessary because the Muslim vote did not want to stand with the weaker SP
 mulaayam singh bhi kai baar alp sankhyak samudaay ko sapa ke saath khadey hone kii bhaavnaatmak apil kar chuke hai
 The BSP-BJP is also keeping an eye, let us know that Muslims have been supporting the SP for the last 15 years
 1991 ke baad aamtaur par muslim vot bijepi ko haraane vaali party ko hi jaataa rahaa he
 This time the BSP and BJP are trying to make a dent in this sp's vote bank
 basapa ne is baar 97 muslim chehron ko mauka diya he
 Last time, he gave tickets to only 67 Muslim leaders
 jabaki bhaajapa haj sabsidi or kaaman civil code jaise mudde ched kar muslim vot bank shift karnaa chaahati he
 bjp's plan Like Mayawati, BJP is focusing on social engineering in UP this time
 bijepi kii pehali list main isaki jhalak saaf najar aati he
 BJP has focused on caste in view of UP elections
 bijepi ne 64 savarna (jisamen 33 kshatriya or 11 brahman), 44 obisi or 26 dalit maidan main utaare hai
 According to a leader involved in the bjp's election campaign, the BJP is trying its best to make a dent in the OBC and Dalit vote banks, apart from its core vote bank Savarna
 tikat bhi unhen hi diya ja rahaa he jinke jeetne kii sambhaavna prabal ho

 Currently, the police have registered a case of murder and are looking for the accused

 log shikaayat karte hai ki har kaam ke rate fiks hai
 Whether the allegations are true or false, you would know better
 satta ek baar phir aapke haathon main he, so janata aapse 'rajdharm kaa paalan' karne kii ummid rakhti he

 When a girl belonging to a Brahmin family of Titarauda village in singhwali-ahir in Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat district went away with a boy from a neighboring Dalit family, the Brahmin society threatened the administration, alleging abduction if the girl was not brought back safely If gone, all the Brahmin families of the area will become Muslims

 However, from the sociological point of view, they argue that any social group takes three ways to protect their interest
 ek, aawaaj uthaata he, taaki jo bhi pareshaani he usase batch sake
 Secondly, if speaking does not work, then the opposition comes down and thirdly, when there is no hearing, then it chooses the way out of that system
 
 
 
 So Muslims will become Muslims, but if the society is forced to choose the third path, is it not responsible for the administration as well as the society? The incident at Tithorada village in Baghpat is related to the perceived prestige of the society trapped in poverty and caste-based

 This is the reason that while this pandal of worship is hurting the leader and the government on one side, it is also reminding the common people who have forgotten the closed sugar mill

 The Pooja Committee behind making the pandal said that perhaps this time, due to the grace of Goddess Durga, the leaders should come to goodwill and start a sugar mill

 Indian viewers were once surprised to see why Indian batsman Rohit is joining the celebrations after the dismissal of captain Kohli
 thodi der baad unhen maajaraa samaj main aayaa ki ye mumbai indiens factor he
 Let me tell you that both Malinga and Rohit play in the IPL with Mumbai Indians team
 agle batsman ke taur par aae hardik pandya ne bhi malinga ko badhai di
 Malinga achieved this achievement in the 203rd match of ODI career
 is mukaam par pahunchane vaale ve duniya ke 13wein bowler hai
 At the same time, he is the fourth Sri Lankan and ninth Asian cricketer to have done 300 or more wickets
 ipel spot phixing maamle main ab ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Suspended officer of Tamil Nadu Police Sampat Kumar has also reached the Supreme Court
 unka kahana he ki spot phixing main bisisiai ke kai padaadhikari or cricketer bhi shaamil hai, jinaki jaanch ke liye special investigation team kaa gathan hona chahie
 Sampath has also sought a stay on the order of his suspension from the Supreme Court
 gauratlab he ki shuruyaat main ipel spot phixing maamle kii jaanch sanpat kumaar ke paas thi, lekin unke bayanon ke baad unhen is cese se hataa diya gaya or baad main nilambit kar diya gaya
 The CBCID is currently investigating the case in Tamil Nadu
 supreme court main daayar apni arji main sanpat ne bisisiai par aarope lagaaya ki maamla hiprophile logon se judaa hone kii vajah se is jaanch ko dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Apart from the BCCI officials, some cricketers are also involved in this case
 sanpat ne supreme court main daakhil niloy dutt kii report kaa bhi samathrn kiya he, jisamen kuch tiimon or cricketron kii bhoomika sandigdh bataate hue jaanch kii baat kahi gai he
 Sampat has said that when he started investigating the matter, he was dropped and later suspended
 saath hi aarope lagaaya he ki isi vajah se jaanch team ne mudgal cameti se bhi sahyog nahin kiya or sahi tathy pesh nahin kiye
 So SIT should be formed to investigate this matter
 is maamle main sanpat ne apane nilamban par roak lagane kii bhi maang kii he
 However, the hearing of this entire case is going on in the Supreme Court
 apane pichley aadesh main supreme court ne bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana kii jagah ipel chalane tak sunil gavaskar ko antiram adhyaksh ke taur par niyukt kiya he
 It had also clearly stated in its order that no person associated with India Cement would be a part of BCCI, although players were exempted from it
 supreme court ne desh ke karodon khel premiyon kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue naa kisi team ke khilne par roak lagaai or naa hi kisi khilaadi par
 Meanwhile, another application was filed by the BCCI
 isamen bisisiai ne mudgal cameti ke saamne die gaye cricket team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni en shrinivasana or sundraraman ke bayanon kii audio sidi muhaiyaa karne kii maang kii he
 But at present, the Supreme Court has not accepted this demand and has set a date of April 16 for it
 bisisiai kaa kahana he ki use 16 april ko is maamle main jawaab taiyaar karnaa he, isliye use pehle ye sidi chahie
 Now the next hearing of the case will be on 16 April
 yani ab sanpat kumaar kii maujuudagi se is maamle kii sunwaayee or bhi ahm ho gai he

 Thought not to pick up because of being busy with prime time preparations

 Hello Uncle! Who? 'uncle i am speaking Tathagata
 main prime time dekhtaa hum
 'but your voice sounds like a child
 'haa ankal main baccha hum
 'how old are you and how did you get my number? 'I am 9 years old, my mother has given it to her friend
 ' a child was confusing me in his words
 kahiye kis liye phone kiya aapane
 'uncle in our society no one has crushed a cat with a car
 aise koi car chalaaegaa to hamen bhi kuchal degaa
 Uncle Hum is going to have a meeting of the children
 sosayadi kii central park main
 You will show it in prime time
 ' My forehead was stunned upon hearing it
 chauthi class main padhane vaala nau saal kaa ladkaa ek dam saafe saafe bol rahaa tha
 Even though his mother may have taught, but he was constantly being spoken with confidence
 ankal aap Whatsapp par dekh lijie
 We have written a letter to the society
 hamaari meeting main bade log bhi aayenge
 If you send camera are vaah, aap to kuch zyaada hi samajhadaar maaloom padate hai
 As soon as i said this, i kept the phone and told Sunil Saini and Rajneesh sitting in the news room that we can send an OB van there
 rajnish se vahaan se guzar rahe samvaadadaata ko tathagat kii bataai jagah par bhej diya or sunil saini kahin se obi vine ke jugad main lag gaye
 Sunil urged Sharad Sharma that on his way home he should go to the society where the children are meeting
 dipti bhi puure josh se taiyaar ki aakhri kshan main bhi shots aa gaye to ham ise prime time main shaamil karke rahenge
 It turned out that in the park of Satyam Apartment in Vasundhara Enclave, there are actually 10-15 children
 unke saath kuch kii mummiyaan bhi hai
 Hearing this, my excitement got doubled
 main tathagat or unke doston se prime time main live baat karnaa chahta tha
 The talk of a nine-year-old boy on the phone made it seem that he would talk
 jaldi hi uske maa pita se tivi par dikhaane kii anumati le lee
 In the end it came to know that the elders of the society came and finished the children's assembly and our team was asked to go out respectfully
 puure prime time ke dauraan is baat kaa afsos hota rahaa ki bacchon kii baithak se samaaj par kitna acha asar padataa
 All these things were revolving because i had read the letter of the children which was sent to me on Whatsapp
 chitthee hindi or angreji main likhi gai thi
 It may be that their mothers wrote it, but the feeling was like children
 dear ankal or antee This morning a car in our society crushed a cute kitten
 zaraa sochiye, billi ke bachche kii jagah koi insaan kaa baccha bhi ho saktaa tha
 We play in the society, run and run, a car could have targeted us
 isliye ham is bachche ke liye condolence meeting rakh rahe hai
 Please come please, together we will request to improve and drive carefully with those Uncle Aunties who also drive like a formula race in society
 tippaniyan The children kept a picture of the kitten and held a mourning meeting
 ye sosayadi kii band deevaaron ke bich kaa loktantr he jo apane tareeke se punap rahaa he
 Last Sunday, my daughter and her friends came and said that Uncle, we all have come together to tell you something
 pehle aap promis karo ki aap hamaari baat sunoge
 Uncle boys show strength when we play football
 hamaare saath barabari se nahin khelte
 When it is our turn to be a goalkeeper, we hit very hard shots
 aap hi bataao ye thik nahin he na
 Absolutely wrong, son
 par ankal aap ye sab prime time main dikhaao na
 Make news so that the world knows how wrong it is to show power to girls
 mujhe pataa he ki anginat sosayadi main bachche apane khilne kii jagah hasil karne ke liye lambii ladaai lard rahe hai
 They fight every day and we are defeated by the Khadus Ankal aunts
 par ye kahani aapako isliye bataai kyonki bacchon ko ab pataa chal gaya ki unki baaten nahin suni gayi to kise phone karnaa he

 After the arrest, he told the police that he was suffering from low salary and his duty time
 police ne beeti der raat hi use dilli ke okhla se giraftaar kiya tha
 The entire incident was carried out alone by Pradeep Neloot, who ran the cash van of Diab, alone
 usne khud hi sara plan banaaya or paise ko godaam main chhipaakar aayaa
 Even then he wanted to run away with this money alone
 is ghatana main abhi tak kisi or ke shaamil hone kii baat saamne nahin ai he
 Pradeep Shukla, who hails from UP, is a resident of Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh
 vah ek aise parivaar se he, jo zyada sampann nahin he
 Therefore, he came to Delhi and started running a cash van in a bank
 philhal, vah apane parivaar ke saath south dilli ke harkesh nagar main rahata he
 How the gunman Vinay Patel and accused Pradeep of the cash van of Vardaatbank came to the ATM to go to the Govindpuri Metro station in South Delhi
 isi dauraan ganman vinay ne kaha ki use toilet janaa he
 Pradeep landed the gunman near Okhla vegetable market
 or vine lekar aage bad gaya
 When the gunman calls him immediately, Pradeep tells him that the traffic is high so he is going ahead
 or vah vine lekar faraar ho gaya
 Rashpradeep hid in the warehouse near Okhla mandi and took a van from there to a warehouse behind the old Mercedes showroom near Okhla mandi
 vahaan maujuud bujurg chaukeedaar ram surat ko usne kaha ki kuch saamaan rakhana he, subah le jaaoongaa
 The watchman agreed and Pradeep hid the boxes full of money in the warehouse there

 Shortly thereafter he went back to the warehouse

 Withdrawing money from bank cash, shopping driver Pradeep Shukla left the van near the metro station and came back towards the warehouse

 Going there he bought a watch and new clothes for himself
 shoping karne ke baad pradeep waapas godaam kii taraf aa gaya
 And he himself slept in the same warehouse where he hid the money
 der raat pakadaa gaya pradippulice is lut kii vaardaat ko lekar puri tarah harakat main aa chuki thi
 The police also recovered a can van near Govindpuri metro station
 vine main jeepies laga tha
 The police had to know where the van went
 lihaaja police ne okhla sabji mandi or aas paas ke ilaakon main chaanbin shuru kii
 And late night Pradeep was arrested after raiding the warehouse
 lut kii rakam bhi vahaan se baraamad ho gai
 The watchman of the Chowkidar arrested the warehouse from which Pradeep was arrested and recovered the money
 uske bujurg chaukeedaar ram surat se bhi poochtacha kii gai
 But till now the police have not got any clue that the watchman is involved in this incident

 uske kuch der baad company ke manager dinesh ne okhla thane main shikaayat darj karai
 The accused was arrested on the morning of 27 November
 rakam baraamad hui
 Even before the van had run away with the Pradeep Police sources, the accused driver had run away with the cash van once before
 lekin tab vah vine lekar company waapas pahunch gaya tha
 This case is from gk-1's Jamrudpur a few months ago
 jahaan jhagade ke baad vine ke ganman ne ek aadmi ko goli maar di thi
 And the driver of the van ran away with the van
 vah driver pradeep shukla hi tha
 But then he had secured the van and reached the company
 pehle bhi dilli main hui hai is tarah kii ghatnaayenrajdhani dilli main cash vine lut kii yah vaardaat pehali baar nahin he
 Even before this, many such incidents have been happening in Delhi
 jinamein bank cash vine ko lut liya gaya yaa phir vine stoff yaa surakshakarmi hi pailaa lekar bhaag nikle
 Let's look at some special incidents - November 29, 2014 The miscreants looted Rs 1
5 crore from an ATM cash van in Kamla Nagar area of delhi
 saath hi vine main savaar guard ko badmaashon ne goli maar di thi
 The miscreants shot two bullets in the guard's head

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, protests against the Citizenship (amendment) Bill 2019 were observed in the northeastern states of the country in January
 nagarikon or vibhinn jaateey-dharmik samoohon ke alaava vipakshi partiyon, yahaan tak ki bijepi netaa or isaki sahyogi partiyon ne bhi iskaa virodh kiya
 There were a number of fears in their minds, such as this bill would lead to a demographic change in the area, violation of the right to equality before the law or discrimination of citizens on the basis of religion
 udhaaharan ke taur par, assam main yah sawaal uthta rahaa ki naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak 1985 ke assam ecord kaa ulanghan karata he
 The National Citizenship Register (NRC) and Assam Accord being prepared by the government - both do not consider religion as the basis
 ye donon kisi ko bhartiya naagarik maanane yaa kisi ko videshi ghoshit karne ke liye 24 march, 1971 ko aadhaar maanate hai
 The purpose of the amendment is not clear from the Citizenship (amendment) Bill, what is the basis of people to whom citizenship is to be given or not
 kisi bhi vidheyak main ek khand main 'uddeshyon or kaarnon kaa byora' (statement of Objects and Reasons) hota he, jisamen vistaar se bataaya janaa chahie ki yah sanshodhan kyon or kis uddeshy ke liye kiya ja rahaa he, lekin is vidheyak main aisa nahin hua
 a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) oversaw this amendment for two and a half years and submitted the report in January this year
 is samiti ne vidheyak ke uddeshy ke bare main spashtikaran maanga to sarkaar kii ore se do baaten kahi gayi: (a) sanshodhan ke liye jari 'cabinet note' main iskaa 'zikr' kiya gaya he
 (b) It has been mentioned in the 2015 and 2016 notifications of the Ministry of Home Affairs
 jepisi ne bina sawaal kiye ye spashtikaran sweekaar kar liye
 It is surprising that the Cabinet notes are not public papers and the facts given in them are not known, while any amendment is made to the law, its explanation and explanation are given in the 'objectives and Reasons' section of the Bill
 goes
 duusare, grih mantralay ke notifications main labhaarthiyon kaa nayaa samooh banane ke liye sirf 'dharmik utpeedan' kaa zikr he
 These notifications amend the 'passport (entry into India) 1950' to add six minority groups (hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian) coming from two neighboring countries Bangladesh and Pakistan and say 'these groups are religious persecution or Fear of religious persecution has forced them to take refuge in India
 ' isaki vyakhya kahin nahin kii gai he ki kis aadhaar par, kin aankadon yaa vishleshanon ke sahare yah nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki kuch nishchit deshon ke nishchit dharmik samooh dharm ke aadhaar par pratadit kiye ja rahe hai or duusare pratadit nahin kiye ja rahe hai
 In fact, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had admitted that no authentic survey or accurate data is available on who will benefit from the amendment to the Citizenship Act 1955
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki sambandhit alpsankhyak samoohon se kareeb 30,000 log hai jo bharat main lambii avadhi ke vija par rah rahe hai, unhen laabh milegaa
 The JPC report also confirms this fact
 yah intelegence beuro (IB) ke hawaale se kahati he ki sanshodhan ke baad jo naagarikta chaahate hai, unhen sabit karnaa hoga ki ve dharmik utpeedan ke chalate bharat aae hai
 The biggest challenge before the Citizenship (amendment) Bill is the classification and beneficiary of the beneficiaries
 And shall not deprive them of legal protection
 'naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak ko chunauti dene vaali ek yachika supreme court main lambit he or jaise hi sansad yah vidheyak paas karegi, is yachika par sunwaayee hogi
 The Citizenship (amendment) Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha in January this year, but it was not passed in the Rajya Sabha
 pichhali loksabhaa ke bhang hone ke saath hi yah vidheyak swat: radd ho gaya
 Now it will need to be reintroduced
 anuchhed 14 ko lekar sajag JPC ne kanoonee maamalon ke vibhaag se spashtikaran maanga tha
 The department said that there is no such violation
 vibhaag ne ram krishna daalamia banaam justise esaaar tendulkar maamle main supreme court ke faisle kaa bhi hawala diya he, jo 'anuchhed 14 ke vaastavik arth or sambhaavnaaon' par kendrit he
 This judgment places two pre-conditions for equality of treatment in some kind of classification: (i) It should be based on intelligible differentia, which are placed in any beneficiary group and which are not kept in them
 Makes a logical distinction
 (ii) yah vibhed jo bhi lakshya praapt karne ke liye kiya gaya he, is vibhed kaa iske lakshya se ek 'taarkik sambandh' (rational relation) hona chahie
 The JPC did not seek to know or seek clarification on why and how Muslims were not included in the beneficiary groups and whether it was a discriminatory violation of Article 14
 JPC ne kanoonee vibhaag kaa saadhaaran sa jawaab sweekaar kar liya ki yah bhedbhaavpurn nahin hoga
 It is well known that the Rohingya in Myanmar (some of these were sent to Bangladesh in January this year)
 ), pakistan main ahmadiya, bangladesh main shiya or afghanistan main (hazaras) muslim dharmik pratadna jhel rahe hai
 Indian Muslims who went to Pakistan at the time of partition as idioms
 aaj ve bhi vahaan dharmik utpeedan kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Similarly, the JPC did not even question whether keeping Sri Lanka and Myanmar out of this group is not a violation of Article 14
 isane grih mantralay kaa spashtikaran sweekaar kar liya jisamen kaha gaya he ki in deshon se aae sharnaarthiyon se jude maamalon ko 29 disambar, 2011 ko jari standard oparating proscisger (SOP) ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he, yah masalaa naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak se alag he
 The 2011 SOP stipulates that in cases where prima facie it appears that someone is being harassed due to ethnic, religious, sexual, nationality, cultural groups, social groups, political views, etc
 State governments can send recommendations to the Ministry of Home Affairs for long-term visas after security checks
 yani SOP lambii avadhi ke vija ke bare main anubandh karata he na ki naagarikta ke bare main
 It is incomprehensible to grant long-term visas by not giving citizenship to the people of Sri Lanka and Myanmar
 in tathyon ko dekhte hue yah spasht nahin he ki supreme court ke samaksh taarkik vibhed (intelligible Differentia) ko banaae rakh paanaa kaise sambhav hoga
 What is clear now is that the government should review the Citizenship (amendment) Bill one more time before it is reintroduced in Parliament
 naagarikta kii punarpariklpana karke sarkaar un sawaalon se batch sakati he jo vidheyak paas hone ke baad supreme court main yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan uthne vaale hai
 Apart from this, the government can also bring this bill closer to the Indian idea of 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'

 In such a situation, it will be very difficult to get relief from the High Court

 Comparison of India's performance in the Games can only be done if we assess and study it objectively
 landan olympic se milane vaala sabase bada bonus yah he ki pehali baar bharat kii chunauti kai khelon tak faili he
 Our athletes will return with optimism amid the painful consequences of hockey and tennis

 The sports that are faster than noise news are hockey, tennis and archery

 The operators of these sports will have to do something now or else the Olympic significance of their sport in India will end

 Hockey is based on its golden history and tennis is always playing a special category in India

 The election campaign in Karnataka is at its peak
 12 may ko rajya kii janata apane janadesh kaa istemaal karegi or 15 may ko matganana ke saath hi rajya kii chunavi tasviir bhi saaf ho jaaegi
 The main contest is believed to be between the Congress and the BJP, while the JDS is trying its political fortunes as the third force
 desh kii sabase puraani party congress ke liye ye chunaav kaaphi ahm he
 After Punjab, Karnataka remains the second largest Congress stronghold in the country
 ise jitkar 2019 ke chunaav ke liye congress party or rahul gandhi apni daavedaari majbootee se pesh kar sakenge
 What conditions will arise from the victory or defeat of the Congress in Karnataka
 padhein
 -1 if won
 karnataka model se gujarat model ko milegi chunautimodi ke gujarat model ke saamne congress kaa karnataka model abhi chunauti he
 If the party wins the Karnataka election, it will present it in the 2019 election
 party ne karnataka main yuvaaon, daliton, mahilaon kaa mudda uthaaya he to dharmanirpekshata kaa card bhi khelaa he
 At the same time, by visiting temples and monasteries, Rahul Gandhi has also tried to carry the soft Hindutva card
 agar ye prayog safal rahaa to congress party ise 2019 ke chunaav main bhi aajamaa sakati he
 2
 modi virdohi dalon kii khmebandi tej hogikarnataka main agar congress jitati he to isse uske peeche modi virdohi dalon kii khmebandi tej hogi
 The chances of coming together with the parties that are reluctant to accept Rahul Gandhi's leadership will also increase
 endie ke jo dal asantusht hai jaise shivasena
 She can come along
 3
 Brand Rahul's claim will be stronger than that of Brand Modi, and in an aggressive manner, the Congress party fielded Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat elections
 uskaa phayda bhi party ko mila
 The Congress was very close to winning
 karnataka jeetne se brands rahul brands modi ke mukaable kadi chunauti banakar ubharegaa
 The opposition needed a bigger face than Modi since the 2014 carnage
 pichley saal rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh kaa pad sambhalakar is chunauti ko front se sweekaar kiya he
 Now the Karnataka election can prove its success
 vipakshi dalon main ye bharosa jagega ki brands modi ko chunauti di ja sakati he or isamen rahul kaa phase sweekaarya ho saktaa he
 4
 2019 ke liye modi sarkaar ke khilaaf agenda tay hogakarnataka chunaav jeetne main agar congress party kaamyaab rahati he to isse modi sarkaar ke khilaaf 2019 kaa agenda bhi tay hoga
 The Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi have landed in the political summer of Karnataka by taking forward the issues of youth, unemployment, farmers' plight, violence against Dalits and Muslims, etc
 If the party wins here, it can move ahead on the same agenda for 2019
 5
 The Congress will strengthen its position in talks with allies about the alliance
 If Congress wins, it will increase its bargaining power for 2019
 desh ke 5 bade rajyon- bihar, upi, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu or maharashtra jahaan congress gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke dam par chunavi dam dikhaane kii taiyaari main he vahaan congress kii sthiti bahut majboot nahin he
 In such a situation, after winning Karnataka, the Congress will be able to put its place firmly in the seat sharing
 agar congress haar gai to-1
 a big political fort will come out of the hands, if the Congress loses the election of Karnataka, then it will lose a big political fort
 iske baad congress ke paas sirf punjab kaa kila bachegaa
 This could prove to be a big setback for the party before 2019
 isliye congress kisi bhi keemat par karnataka chunaav jeetna chaahegi
 2
 2019 se pehle brands rahul ko bada jhatka lagegabrands modi ke mukaable brands rahul ko khadaa karne kii congress kii ranneeti ke lihaaj se karnataka ke nattejey kaaphi ahm sabit hone ja rahe hai
 If the party loses this election, it will increase the possibility of a split in the opposition
 tisare morche kii sugabugahat teji hogi or isse sidhaa phayda bijepi ko pahonchega
 3
 karnataka model fail sabit ho jayegakarnataka agar congress ke haath se nikal jaataa he to modi ke gujarat model ke mukaable congress kaa karnataka model kamjor sabit hoga
 The Congress has been in power in Karnataka for the last 5 years
 vahaan ke kaam ke daavon or nitiyon kaa prachaar party ne khub kiya he
 Even party strategists are constantly discussing their Karnataka model in front of the Gujarat model
 bijepi kaa daanv jahaan yediurppa se zyada modi magic par he vahiin congress kendriya netaaon kii jagah siddharmaiya card par zyada nirbhar he
 Along with this, another laboratory of Rahul Gandhi's soft Hindutva is also proving to be Karnataka
 agar ye prayog safal nahin hota he to party ke saamne mushkilen badhengi
 4
 gathbandhan ko lekar baatcheet main sthiti kamjor hogicongress agar karnataka kaa chunaav haar jaati he to 2019 ke liye jin dalon ke saath uski baatcheet chal rahi he vahaan congress kii sthiti kamjor hogi
 Anyway, SP, BSP, Trinamool Congress, NCP, DMK, RJD are all such parties which have tremendous hold in their respective states
 karnataka haarane se congress kii bargening capacity kam hogi
 5
 dakshin bharat main bhi brands modi kii chunauti bad jaegimodi magic ke dam par bijepi zyadattar hindi bhashi rajyon kii satta par kabiz he lekin gaiyr hindi bhashi rajyon main congress kii sthiti ab bhi majboot he
 Even when the Congress was reduced to 44 seats in the 2014 elections, the Congress got 33 seats from South India and the rest of non-hindi speaking states
 karnataka main agar congress haar jaati he to bijepi ke liye dakshini rajyon main sambhaavnaaon ke nae dwaar khulenge
 In strong Congress strongholds like Telangana, Hyderabad, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, BJP will be trying to strengthen its claim

 ayog ne iviem kaa madraboard badalakar mahaj 90 second main gadabadi karne ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ke daawey ko bhi puri tarah khaarij kar diya
 Rajat Mona, a member of the Commission's technical committee, said, "the machine on which tampering has been performed in the assembly is merely a device that looks like an EVM, not an EVM
" is mashin ke aadhaar par iviem ko hack karne kaa daawa niraadhaar he
 "mona is also the director of Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai
 tippaniyan The statement said that "the Commission has come to know through media reports of a live demonstration of tampering of an evm-like machine in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
" lekin samajhane vaali baat yah he ki iviem jaisi dikhne vaali koi mashin banaakar isamen gadabadi karne kaa pradarshan kiya ja saktaa he lekin iske aadhaar par yah kahana sahi nahin hoga ki ayog ke iviem ke saath bhi aisi hi chhedchhad kii ja sakati he
 "the Commission said that by allegedly manipulating the evms by programming the matching machine as per their wish, the election commission's claims of disturbances in the machines cannot affect the discerning citizens of the country

 The Commission said that to clear the doubts of EVM disturbances, the Election Commission has convened an all-party meeting on 12 May
 isamen iviem ko gadabadi se mukt rakhane ke liye kiye gaye suraksha upayon kii vistaar se raajnneetik dalon ko jaankaree di jaayegi
 Also, the Commission has already made these information public on its website
 ayog kii takneekee samiti kii sadsy rajat mona ne kaha, "vidhansabha main jis mashin par chhedchhad kaa pradarshan kiya gaya he vah iviem kii tarah dikhne vaala ek upkaran maatr he, iviem nahin
 The claim to hack evms based on this machine is baseless
 " mona bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan bhilai kii nideshak bhi hai
 The comments bayaan main kaha gaya he ki "ayog ko media repotaren ke marfat dilli vidhansabha main iviem jaisi dikhne vaali ek mashin ke saath chhedchhad karne ke sajiv pradarshan kii jaankaree mili he
 But the thing to understand is that by making a machine that looks like an EVM, it can be demonstrated to be a mess, but on the basis of this, it is not correct to say that the EVM of the Commission can be tampered with
 " ayog ne kaha ki iviem se milti -julati mashin main programing kar apni marji ke mutabik isamen chhedchhad kaa kathith pradarshan kar chunaav ayog kii mashiinon main gadabadi kaa daawa desh ke samajhadaar nagarikon ko prabhavit nahin kar saktaa he
 Earlier, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had challenged the commission to alter the motherboard of evms in just 90 seconds, citing the performance of tampering of evm-like machines in the assembly
 ayog ne kaha ki iviem main gadabadi kii shankaaon ko dur karne ke liye hi nirvachan ayog ne 12 may ko sarvadaleey baithak bulaai he
 In this, the political parties will be informed about the security measures taken to keep the evms free from disturbances
 saath hi ayog in jaankariyon ko pehle hi apni website par saarvajanik kar chukaa he
 The statement said that "the Commission has come to know through media reports of a live demonstration of tampering of an evm-like machine in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
" lekin samajhane vaali baat yah he ki iviem jaisi dikhne vaali koi mashin banaakar isamen gadabadi karne kaa pradarshan kiya ja saktaa he lekin iske aadhaar par yah kahana sahi nahin hoga ki ayog ke iviem ke saath bhi aisi hi chhedchhad kii ja sakati he

 The loss of runs by Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh remains a matter of concern for the team
 pichley saal pakistan ke khilaaf test kariyar kii shuruyaat karne vaale marsh ke khate main ab tak ek ardhashatak bhi nahin he
 Boxing Day is going to start from 26th December
 westeindies ke khilaaf is test ke liye antim ekadash main ab feet ho chukeusman khwajako shaamil karne kii jaddojahad he
 However, for whom Khwaja will play, the names of Shannon Marsh and Joe Byrne are at the forefront
 selectors marsh kii bataur alrounder upyogita kii vajah se use lagaataar team main jagah de rahe hai
 In the past, the Australian team has kept one or two all-rounders in the team with four batsmen
 ritairement se pehle shen watasan bhi lagaataar team ke isi game plan main feet baithte rahe
 Mitchell Marsh has been contributing fruitfully to the team in bowling
 unhone pichley kai test maichon main ahm maukon par saajhedaari tod kar team ko phayda pahunchaaya he
 He 26 in the last five Tests
 61 kii ausat se 13 wicket liye hai
 But the team expects him to contribute more in batting
 adhiktar number 6 par ballebaaji ke liye utarane vaale mishael ne pichley saal yuai main pakistan ke khilaaf padaarpan ke baad se ab tak ek bhi ardhashatak nahin jadaa he
 Marsh also understands that there is pressure on him to score runs
 marsh ne kaha, ‘mujh par ran banane kaa thodaa dabaav jarur he
 But i try not to pay too much attention to it because we had scored over 500 runs in three of the last four Tests
 is lihaaj se mujh par zyada dabaav nahin he
 He said, 'as a batsman you are expected to score runs but if you do not do that then you are under pressure
 australian khilaadi hone ke kaaran aisa hona laazmi he
 i am not thinking much about it at the moment
 christmas aa rahaa he or boxing de test match kaa lutf uthaanaa chahta hum
 Marsh also took a wicket during the big win over the West Indies at Hobart and spent most of the time wearing pads as the partnership between his brother Sean Marsh and Adam Vogue was ongoing
 in donon ne is dauraan world record partnership main 449 ran bane
 Mitchell got only 11 balls to play in the match before captain Smith declared the innings
 main batting ke liye intjaar karne ke dauraan apana dimag ballebaaji se hataae rakhata hum
 i do not want to let my energy go
 yah swaabhaavik he ki jab aap puraa din apni baari kaa intjaar karte hue bitaate hai to aap thakne lagate hai
 Getting out to bat after a partnership of over 400 is great for the team
 shaun or vog ko ek saath australia ke liye ballebaaji karte dekhnaa bahut gajab kaa anubhav tha
 This summer i have waited a lot for my batting, but it has been very good for us
 main is baat se khush hum ki hamane is dauraan 500 se adhik ran banaae
 i would love to come after such a partnership and keep trying to add some runs for the team

 The accused tells the woman lawyer that she is very mentally disturbed
 uske saath jo shoshan hua he, uske liye vah thane jaakar shikaayat darj kara degi
 After this Harshit said that he is out of the country, then he went and lodged a complaint in the police station
 iske baad medical jaanch ke naam par phir unhen blackmel karne lagi
 The tape has been sent for investigation
 aaropee mahila-main finali mently taiyaar ho gai hum
 For the thing i said
 main thane main bataane ja rahi hum ki meraa shoshan hua he
 i was shown big days
 vakil harsith-aap meri baat samajhie

 No, i can't wait any longer
 main bahut pareshaan hum
 After this, the accused woman lodged a complaint at the police station
 darasal harsith dilli main nahin the
 His mother-in-law had died, due to which he was in Mumbai
 aaropee mahila unako baar-baar phone karke dilli aane ke liye kah rahi thi, taaki is maamle main koi deal ho sake
 She was also mentally disturbed by him
 aaropee mahila-bhai sahab, mujhe aapako yahi bataanaa tha ki maine exiaar darj kara di he
 Now to be medical

 You tell me aap jo bolengi, main karne ko taiyaar hum
 Accused woman - no no brother, i have told you what i had to tell
 medical ke baad kya hota he aap kisi se bhi pataa kara lo
 Let us tell that in this case, Delhi Police has filed a charge sheet in Tis Hazari Court on Saturday
 chargeshit ke mutabik, aaropee mahila ne apane ghar main khufia camera lagavaaya tha
 Through this, she used to make VIP people a sex tape by trapping them in her web and then blackmailing them to make big money
 aaropee mahila neblacmelingke liye apane ghar main hai technology kaa spai camera lagavaaya tha
 Formerly accused woman has also blackmailed Uttarakhand government minister Harak Singh Rawat and a Congress MP
 aaropee mahila paise lekar court main bayaan badal detii thi
 He had also filed a complaint against MP KC Patel
 punjab main navjot singh siddhu or mukhyamantri amarinder singh ke bich jari jubaani jang ne ab alag mode le liya he
 The Amarinder Singh camp had sent a complaint to the party high command along with audio-video clips of all statements made during Navjot Singh Sidhu's election
 ab siddhu dwaara kiye gaye chunaav prachaar or un siton ke parinaam kii bhi list haikaman ko thamai ja rahi he taaki siddhu ke khilaaf kadi karrwai sunishchit kii ja sake
 According to the report card prepared by Captain Khemé, from April 12 to May 17, Sidhu campaigned in 56 seats
 inamen se chaar loksabhaa kshetra aise the jahaan par vah do baar prachaar karne gaye or party sirf 7 siten hi jeet pai
 The Congress faced a crushing defeat in 49 seats
 punjab congress report ke madhyam se alaakaman ko yah bhi bataaegi ki jis tarah se siddhu kii chhavi ko star prachaarak or bade netaa ke taur par dikhaaya jaataa he, vaisaa kuch nahin he
 Sidhu does not have the ability to change the electoral atmosphere on his own
 report main yah bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki siddhu pradesh kii jin 2 siton par prachaar karne pahunche, party ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 His Pakistan-loving image has also suffered
 mana ja rahaa he ki agle hafte kii shuruyaat main captain amarinder singh or sunil jakhad punjab prabharee aashaa kumari ke saath dilli jaakar rahul gandhi or congress alaakaman ko report saunpenge
 According to sources, Navjot Singh Sidhu is also camping in Delhi to present his case against Rahul Gandhi and the high command against Captain Amarinder Singh
 siddhu ko lekar congress netaaon ke tikhe hamale jari hai
 Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh blamed Navjot Singh Sidhu's statements and embracing Pakistan Army Chief General Bajwa for the loss of 5 out of 13 seats in Punjab
 vahiin ab punjab cabinet main navjot singh siddhu ke saathi cabinet mantri sadhu singh dharmasot ne kaha ki agar siddhu ne rahul gandhi ke amethi se haarane par raajnneeti se sanyas lene kii baat kahi thi, to unhen mantri pad kaa tyaag kar dena chahie
 He should resign from the party and the government
 sadhu singh dharmasot ne kaha ki siddhu itane bade leader nahin he ki bheed ko voton main tabdeel kar saken
 At rallies and political gatherings, artists and laughers are called to gather the crowd
 unhone kaha ki siddhu ab raajnneeti chhod kamedi sho karen
 Who is Sidhu to defeat or win someone? ludhiana se saansad ravanit singh bittu ne to siddhu ko lekar ye tak kah daalaa ki vah aksar bhaawanaaon main aakar kuch bhi bol jate hai or uske baad captain amarinder kii kothi par jaakar maafee maang lete hai
 His wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu has raised questions on Sidhu being targeted
 unhone kaha ki jahaan-jahaan vidhayakon ne kaam kiya, vahaan jeet mili
 Won in Patiala and also in Amritsar
 captain amarinder ko aise sawaal nahin uthaane chahie jaise wo sawaal uthaa rahe he
 Sidhu campaigned at the behest of Rahul Gandhi
 wo aaj bhi party ke liye samarpit hai
 Not Sidhu, those people who are in Congress while supporting other parties are wrong and are targeting Sidhu

 jaise hi khabar ai ki pakistan kii antakawaad virdohi adaalat ne mumbai hamale ke aaropee lakhvi ko zamaanat par chhod diya he, bharat main hangaamaa much gaya or aatankwaad ko lekar pakistan ke doharepan par hamalaa shuru ho gaya
 It seemed that the shared understanding against terrorism in both India and Pakistan had broken again
 netaa bharat banaam pakistan ke lahaze main bayaan dene lage
 After all, the impact of the Mumbai attack is no less than Peshawar
 mumbai hamalon main 166 log maare gaye the
 Zakiurrahman Lakhvi was lodged in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi for the last five years along with 6 other accused in this case
 zamaanat ke faisle kii rihaai kii khabar us vakt ai jab seemaa ke is paar se logon ne aatankwaad se ladane main pakistan ke iraadon ko bharose se dekhnaa shuru kiya tha
 Lakhvi is the person who fully planned the Mumbai attacks
 pakistan main baithkar satellite phone par mumbai main hamalaa kar rahe aatankwaadiyon ko nirdesh dene kaa kaam kiya
 a charge sheet was filed against him in 2009
 paanch saal jail main rahane ke baad aatankwaad virdohi adaalat ne sabooton kii kami ke aadhaar par reeha kiya gaya he
 The government lawyer also opposed the surety
 fedral invastegating agency ke vakil azhar choudhary ne enditivi se kaha ki ve jamaanat milane se achambhe main hai
 He said, we strongly opposed the surety
 lakhvi ke kilaaf paryaapt saboot hai
 We have shown all the evidence to the court
 jaise hi hamen order kii copy milegi ham iske khilaaf apil karenge
 ' pichley paanch saal main pakistan kii adaalat main mumbai hamale kii sunwaayee lagaataar talati rahi, kyonki kai baar jaj badale, kuch jajon ne dhamkee kii vajah se tabadalaa karvaa liya, kuch lambii chuttee par chale gaye
 Several government lawyers dropped the case after being threatened
 hafiz said bhi isi tarah sabooton kii kami ke kaaran reeha ho gaya
 Today, in the Indian Express, Pakistani journalist and filmmaker Bina Sarwar has written in her article that when India asks why the courts of Pakistan continue to leave Hafiz Saeed, they forget that our courts are like India Huh
 yahaan doshi ko sazaa dilvaanaa aasaan nahi hota
 There is also no law or system of witness protection in Pakistan
 saath hi jaanch kaa tarika bhi purana or kharaab he jisase ye aatankwaadi batch jate hai
 They escape from the court, but Hafiz Saeed also rents the rail for the rally
 binaa sarwar kii tarah america main pakistan ke purv rajdoot hossain hakkaani, newshwik pakistan ke salaahkaar sampadak khaleed ahamed ne bhi indian express main peshawar kii ghatana ke sandarbh main likhaa he
 All these have highlighted the hollowness of the anti-india or US statement in their article and said that Pakistan has to understand that the fire in its house is due to its foreign policy
 videsh niti kaa matlab bharat virdohi nitiyon se
 Part of Haqqani's article is that not only the tehreek-e-taliban in Pakistan, there are many terrorist groups who are carrying out attacks
 islamic atvaad ne pakistan ko ek aadhunik raashtra ke rup main viksit nahin hone diya he
 The ISI may feel that the Haqqani network, Mullah Omar's Afghan Taliban, lashkar-e-toiba, Jamaat-ud Dawa, will not act within Pakistan, but there is no guarantee that these organizations are Sipah-e Sahaba, lashkar-e-janghvi, Pakistani Taliban Such as will not help regional forces, which can carry out attacks within Pakistan
 zaahir he pakistan se aa rahi in awaazon ko pahchaanane kii zarurat he
 What the people of India are saying is also saying the people there and the media is also giving such voice a lot of space
 binaa sarwar or khalid ne bhi likhaa he ki akhabaaron or tivi main kai log bharat virdohi bayaan ke naam par apni kerani par pardaa daal lete hai, itnaa hi nahin kai netaaon ne dar or gathjod ke kaaran naam lekar taharik-e-taliban ke khatme kii maang nahin kii he
 Everyone kept shouting in grief
 2013 main jab aatankwaadiyon ne ek carch par hamalaa kar diya tha usamen 100 se zyada log maare gaye the or 54 bachche anaath ho gaye the
 Pakistan did not take any action in that case either
 is maamle main sena pramukh general raahil sharif saahasik kadam uthaa rahe hai, lekin yahi sena bhi to taliban se mili hui thi
 Even though Pakistan continues to call jihadi groups as essential, they cannot be trusted
 yah bhi samajhnaa chahie ki pakistan kaa system ek din main badalane vaala nahin he
 Nevertheless, the opinion of the people there has changed rapidly when on Lakhvi's release, there has been a hashtag on Twitter that Lakhvi opposes the bail and Pakistan is with India
 logon se aa rahi is awaz ko tham lijie
 Like many people of India tweeted on Tuesday that India is with Pakistan
 phir bhi lakhvi kii rihaai kii khabar aate hi media hamaare netaaon par tut padaa
 They, too, left the sensibility of the last two days and started attacking Pakistan's duplicity
 ek had tak sahi bhi he, lekin sthaayee samaadhaan ke liye kahin na kahin nai baton par tikna bhi zaruri he
 Even if the risk is large
 tamaam dalon ke netaa pakistan ke khilaaf aag ugalane lage
 This news has been given less attention in Pakistan channels
 vahaan abhi bhi log aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar netaaon sena se sawaal kar rahe hai
 Pakistan People's Party leader Sheri Rehman has said that if anyone has a soft attitude, they will also be treated as terrorists
 pakistan ke army chif afghanistan gaye to vahaan se madad kaa bharosa mila lekin yah jawaab bhi ki aatankwaadi pakistan ke hi the
 The hanging houses are being cleaned again in Pakistan's jails
 vahaan 2008 ke baad se faansee kii sazaa par aghoshit rup se roak laga di gai thi
 But now both the target and the time have been given to hang the convicted terrorists in the jails there
 abhi tak yah saaf nahin he ki ye aatankwaadi taliban se taalluk rakhte hai yaa chote mote aatanki sanghathanon se
 On the other hand, how will Pakistan fight the terrorists who are getting shelter from the system from outside the prison
 kya sena eemaandaaree se lard paaegi, sena ladegi to kya siyaasi dal saath denge, siyaasi dal saath denge to kya mazahabi sanghathan bhi aage aaenge
 The answer to all this remains to be found
 isiilie bhartiya videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne kaha he ki lakhvi mumbai hamale kaa mukhya aaropee he, sanyukt raashtra ne bhi use aatankwaadi mana he use zamaanat par kaise choda ja saktaa he
 Lakhvi's bail will only strengthen the terrorists
 bharat pakistan se maang karata he ki is faisle ko palate
 Will fight Taliban but will leave Hafiz Saeed and Lakhvi open
 punam pandey charchaa main bane rahane ke liye koi na koi kaaran dhund hi leti hai

 ye ham nahin kah rahe hai balki viraat ke aankade is baat kii tasdik karte hai
 If you do not believe, then read it yourself

 He is more than any Indian batsman and he is eighth in the world in terms of scoring the most runs

 122
 83 lakshya kaa peechha karte hue international tii20 maichon main viraat kohli kaa ausat he jo unhen duniya kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaz banaata he
 In 39 innings, Virat completed 1500 runs in International T20 matches, the lowest innings taken by any batsman to reach here
 27 pariyon main viraat ne international tii20 maichon main 1000 ran puure kiye, yahaan tak pahunchane ke liye kisi bhi ballebaaz dwaara lee gai ye sabase kam paariyaan hai
 Virat has scored 50 or more international T20 matches 15 times
 unke alaava kris gail or brandan maikkalam bhi ye karnama kar chuke hai lekin iske liye unhone viraat se zyaada match liye
 Virat has scored more than 50 runs in international T20 matches chasing 10 times, this is a record
 baaki ballebaaz zyaada se zyaada 7 baar hi aisa kar paae hai
 Virat Kohli has won the Man of the Match in International T20 matches 9 times
 is formet main sabase zyaada 11 baar ye khitaab pakistan ke shahid aafridi jeet chuke hai lekin iske liye unhone viraat se 56 match zyaada khele hai

 Addressing a lecture on the topic 'saffron Terrorism: Strategy of Misinformation', Indresh Kumar said that the government's investigating agency arrests the culprits in the settlement case but then turns around and blames 'saffron terrorism' for it
 is maamle main pehle pakistan poshit aatankwaad ko jimmedaar bataaya gaya or phir sangh par nishaanaa saadhaa ja rahaa he
 He claimed that information on the investigation of this case is being leaked selectively
 sarkaar ko chahie ki vah maamle kii puri jaanch report ko saarvajanik kare or adaalat main maamle kaa saamana kare
 Terming the association and the association with the Samjhauta blast case as propaganda, he said that terrorism is a 'bhasmasura' but real traitors should be arrested

 He said that the party would take appropriate action after his reply to the show cause notice
 shah ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, pragna thakur kii ummidavaari bhagava aatank ke ek farji maamle ke khilaaf ek satyagrah he
 The then Congress government had compromised national security for votebank politics
 unki ummidavaari iske khilaaf ek satyagrah tha
 Shah accused the Congress of defaming Hindu culture and demanded an apology from Congress President Rahul Gandhi on the issue
 unhone kaha, "bhagava aatank kaa ek farji maamla banaaya gaya, jiske sabhi aaropee bari ho chuke hai
 The court has also said that saffron terror was fiction
 samjhauta express maamle main pehle jo kuch log giraftaar kiye gaye the, ve lashkar se sambandhit the
 American agencies also supported it
 unhone sawaal kiya ki rashtriya suraksha ke saath kisne samjhauta kiya? iske liye koun jimmedaar tha? is ghatana ne hindu samskruti ko badnaam kiya
 The Congress President should apologize for this
 unhone kaha ki party ne pragna thakur ko ek kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he or 10 dinon ke bheetar unase jawaab maanga he
 Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he would never forgive Pragya Singh Thakur and others for calling Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse a patriot
 ullekhneey he ki ek din pehle guuruuvaar ko pragna thakur ne bhopal main samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha, "nathuram godse deshbhakt the, hai or rahenge
 Those who call them terrorists should look into their own religion
 aise logon ko is chunaav main sabak mil jayega
 Pragya's statement went viral
 iske baad bhaajapa ke do saansadon -kendriya mantri anant kumaar hegade or nalin kumaar katil- ne pragna ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya
 Apart from Thakur, Hegde and Katil have also been issued a show cause notice by the party's disciplinary committee
 khargon main piem modi ne ek channel ko diye saakshaatkaar main kaha ki gandhi ke bare main yaa godse par jo bhi baaten kii gayi
 Thus all the statements made are very bad, especially worth hating, are worthy of criticism
 unhone kaha ki sabhy samaaj ke andar is prakaar kii bhashaa nahin chalatiya is prakaar kii soch nahin chal sakati
 That is why those who do this will have to think a hundred times
 modi ne kaha ki doosraa unhone (pragna) maafee maang lee, alag baat he
 But i will not be able to forgive from my heart
 1 july se hi guds and sarvice tex GST ko bharat main lagu kar diya gaya he
 People have called this decision historic
 isi bich retaillers kii duvidha bad gai he kyonki unke smartfones kii bikri kuch dinon se kam ho gai he
 Customers are hopeful that prices may fall further
 gauratlab he ki, aipal ne GST lagu hone ke baad apane modells kii keemten7
 There were subscriptions up to 5%
 jisamen iphone 7, iphone 7 Plus, iphone 6s Plus, iphone 6s or iphone SE bhi shaamil he
 After that Asus had cut the prices of some of its smartphones
 itnaa hi nahin automobile companiyon ne bhi apane kai modells ke keemton main katautee kii he
 Which includes TVS, Honda etc
 ye katautee graahakon ke bich is ummid ko janm detii he ki shaayad keemten or gir sakati hai or unhen giri hui keemat kaa laabh mil jaae
 However, it is also important to mention here that companies like Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Gionee, Intex and Lava had already announced that we will not bring any change in prices even after GST
 is fact ko dhyaan main rakhkar baat karen to saaf he ki keemten girane kii bahut kam hi asaar he
 But media reports suggest that sales in small retail stores have declined and sales are expected to remain affected for a few days
 yani kul milakar graahak GST ke baad smartphone or electronic products kii keemton ko lekar asamanjas main hai or keemten girane kaa intjaar kar rahe hai jisase stores par bikri gir gai he
 But gradually everything will be cleared
