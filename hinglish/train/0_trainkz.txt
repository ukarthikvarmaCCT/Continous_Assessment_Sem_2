 zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen This budget had to curb inflation, accelerate growth, bring confidence in the government and instill confidence in the economy
 in sabko thodaa-thodaa hasil to kiya gaya lekin majbootee se nahin
 This budget is undoubtedly disappointing
 baaten zyada hai, bahut sari choti-choti pahal hui hai, lekin kisi badi pahal kii koi jhalak nahin milti he
 May be, Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi have decided to wait until next year's budget when the new NDA government becomes more experienced
 bharat ek vishaal sankalpana or uske liye thos karrwai ke intjaar main he
 We are looking for such leaders at the summit, who are not afraid to take bold decisions and do not hesitate
 aise netaa shaayad hamen samaj sakate the ki apane bacchon ke liye sunaharaa bhavishya rachane kii koshish main bharat ko nai raah par le jane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Nothing like this has happened and we have come up with a budget which the framers are not ready to take drastic decisions
 shaayad unhone sabko khush karne or kisi ko naakhush nahin karne kii koshish kii he
 But nothing special was achieved, just a little bit has been given here and there
 acha: sudhaaron kii disha dikhti hajetali ke bajet bhaashan or anya vaktavyon se kam-se-kam sudhaaron kii vah disha to dikhaai detii he jisaki ham aane vaale varshon main ummid kar sakate haih manuphaccharing kshetra ko waapas patari par laana
 This is an area that needs better and more reliable financial regulators, basic labor reforms that show flexibility for both employers and workers, efforts to improve skills, and to provide basic capital for small and medium entrepreneurs
 isamen yah bhi mana gaya he ki bharat ko apiemasi adhinium se paribhaashit vyavastha ko badalane kii jarurat he or kisaanon ko bharat ke kisi bhi hisse main bazaaron tak berokatoke pahunch deni hogi
 The recognition of the budget is also welcome that public and private participation is not working as expected
 uski disha badalani hogi
 If we also add better availability of funds for the small and medium scale sector, including solutions to problems in key areas such as bankruptcy law, then an overall direction for the Indian economy becomes clear to us
 kharaab: aankade aise jo bharosemand nahiisamen kar rajasav main jabardast vruddhi kaa anumaan he jabaki arthvyavastha bahut teji se nahin bad rahi he
 At the same time, the expenditure in the budget account is not as much as is usually expected in a dry year
 kul milakar isamen 2014-15 ke liye rajkoshiya ghate ko 4
 1 percent
 isamen to nihsandeh naakaami hi haath lagegi
 This figure 4 by the end of the year
 6 pratishat ke aasapaas rahegaa
 It seems that the shadow of Chidambaram who juggles the figures behind Jaitley is present somewhere
 is sab ko chhod den to bhi sabsidi ke badhate boj kii samasya se nibatane ke liye koi spasht disha sanket nahin he
 It is clear that India's subsidy system will have to be changed to benefit families

 Subsidies have to be better targeted and the leakage measures will be liberated from the water
 lekin bajet main aisa kuch nahin he
 There is no such change in the subsidy which leads to the productive sector
 phir chaahe baat kisaanon kii ho yaa laghu or majhole udhyamon kii
 Average: Half-incomplete reforms in psus The government's huge assets are locked up in the unproductive public sector
 saarvajanik kshetra main vyapak sudhaaron ke saath-saath bade paimaane par nijeekaran or vinievesh kii koshish hoti to bahut acchhee rahati
 Instead, we have about Rs 58,000 crore from disinvestment this financial year
 milane vaale hai
 The direction is good, but it would have been better if a little more in-depth attention had been given to the measures that were easily possible
 gharelu or bahari donon morchon par suraksha ke liye adhik aavanton ek acha kadam he kyonki kai saal tak isaki upeksha kii gai he
 It is advisable to pay more attention to the Northeast region because it has also come
 lekin abhi bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he or ham yahi ummid kar sakate hai ki yah sirf shuruuaat he
 What else? The government has decided to do a little bit and we can only hope that it is preparing itself to take big steps later
 is team kaa anubhav abhi kuch kam he or shaayad modi-jetali khud ko or apni team ko behatar dhang se kaam karne ke liye thodaa or vakt de rahe hai
 If this is the case then we will have to wait for the Budget 2015-16 when the cannons will start running

 Just a day earlier, on 14 February, arms companies across the world gathered at the four-day biennial Aero India 2017 held in Bangalore, where they demonstrated their fighter jets, helicopters and drones to Indian military forces
 iske peeche kaaran yah tha ki agle ek dashak ke dauraan bhartiya sena kii yojana 100 arab dollar se zyada laagat ke sainya upkarnon kii kharid kii he
 These two separate events, held in just a day's gap, show the difference between India's capabilities that this country, as a space power, is completely independent but completely dependent on imported weapons in terms of its military strength
 bharat kii sena duniya kii teesri sabase badi sena he jahaan kaa raksha bajet is saal 2
 74 lakh crore Rs
 kaa he
 India ranks sixth among the countries spending on defense sector in the world
 iske baavjood yahaan kareeb 60 fisadi sainya upkaran aaayaatit hote hai
 India is often labeled the "world's largest arms importer" and between 2012 and 2016, the country alone accounted for 13% of total global arms imports
 loksabhaa main sarkaar ke pesh kiye aankade bataate hai ki 2013 se 2016 ke bich 82,496 karod ru
 Arms were imported
 nai sarkaar bhale hi sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main bharat ke liye sthaayee sadsyta kaa prayaas kar rahi ho, lekin use yah vidambnaapurna tathy nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki parishad ke paanch sthaayee sadasyon main chaar deshon se vah apni suraksha kii vishuddh kharidari karti he
 The reason for this import is the difference between capacity and affordability
 bharat kaa raksha utpaadan tantra-shastr kaarkaanon, shipyardon or prayogshaalaon kaa ek vishaal tantra, jisamen do lakh karmchaaree rojgararat hai, sena kii jaruratein puri kar paane main aksham he
 Defense sector public sector undertakings (dpsus) in India cost Rs 57,000 crore this year
 ke astr-shastr kii aapurti karenge lekin yah sainya balon kii jaruraton ko puraa kar paane main aparyaapt hoga
 Off-the-shelf imports are made to fill this gap, which does not help the technological advantage of Indian industries
 yah ek badi vajah thi ki modi sarkaar ne apni aarthik yojana main chihnit kiye 25 kshetron main raksha utpaadan kshetra ko bhi shaamil kiya, taaki jidipi main utpaadan kii hissedari ko badhaakar 25 fisadi tak laayaa ja sake (maujuuda 16 fisadi se) or 10 karod atirikt rojgaron kaa srijan ho sake
 "make in India" can be counted among the most comprehensive efforts to reverse such import dependence
 pichley teen saal main sarkaar ne is morche par silsilewar kai upayon ko lagu kiya he, jinamein raksha kshetra ko 49 fisadi pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke liye khole jane (or kuch maamalon main isse zyada) se lekar desi utpaadan ko badhaava dene ke liye indiniyasli dijind, dewelaped and menuphacchard (ididm) shrenee kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 The challenges and investments required outside the public sector — for technology, product development enablement and creation of infrastructures — are enormous and will take time
 philhal nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari behad maamuli he, jo kul raksha kshetra main 5 fisadi se bhi kam he
 That is why the government has got private sector companies to enter the sector with the hope of turning them into defense units independent of second-tier players and supplying defense equipment on their own
 pichley do varshon ke dauraan sarkaar ne deepiesu ko di jane vaali praathamikta ko waapas le liya he, jaise seemaa or utpaada shulk main riyaayat vagairah, taaki nijee kshetra uske saath barabari se pratispardhaa main aa sake
 There is a lot of movement on the policy front but the sluggishness remains at the implementation level
 kam se kam teen bade anubandh—landing plateform dox kaa nirmaan (aise jahaaj jo sainya tukdiiyon or sainya vaahanon kaa parivahan kar saken); battlefield management systams kaa vikaas, jisaki madad se chal sainya kataren ek-duusare se sanchaar ke madhyam se judi rah sakati hai; or aadhunik dijal-electric pandubbiyon kaa nirmaan—ab bhi die jane baaki hai, haalanki inaki avadharana ek dashak se zyada puraani ho chuki he
 The Defense Ministry says this is because it still has to approve an important policy regarding strategic partnerships, which was proposed by a task force constituted by it in 2016
 ranneetik saajhedaari ke tahat raksha plateform, network, hathiyaar or saamagree ke vyapak kshetron main nijee kshetra kii companiyon or videshi saajheedaaron ke bich sanyukt upkram kaayam karne kii pariklpana kii gai he
 After circulating among defense ministry bureaucrats, the file has now been sent to the finance ministry to seek its opinion — a private sector CEO named "khanty Officer Tartamol"
 nai dilli ke institute of dephence studies and anolysis main sainya vyay par kaam karne vaale ek shodhakarta lakshmana kumaar behara kehete hai, ''mek in india ke lakshyon ko puraa karne kii raah main sabase bade avarodhon main ek naukarshahi kii udaseenta he
 Another major obstacle in the "government's" Make in India "policy is the lack of orders given to the private sector
 kam-se-kam aise 10 prastaav jo arabon dollar ke hai or jinka uddeshy senaan ko aadhunik inphantry combat vaahanon, sanvaar pranali, hovitger, helicopter or ladaaku jet se yukt karnaa he, ab bhi pipeline main hai
 The needs of the armed forces are very high
 sena ke teenon angon ke mukhyalay integrated dephence staff ke april 2013 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan technology, persepective and capability rodmapya main ucch praudyogiki vaale sainya upkarnon kii bharat ko jarurat kaa moolyankan kiya gaya tha, jinamein drone, prisishan vipan, radar, bandooken, sensor or vimaan shaamil the
 This requirement has been stated to be around $ 100 billion during the next 15 years
 airo india main ek press conference main raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha ki sanyabalon ko kareeb 400 ladaaku jet or 800 se 1,000 helicopteron kii jarurat agle ek dashak main padegi
 "in the next 10 years, we will need 5,000 chopper engines and we will also need 400 LCA engines (light combat aircraft)," he said
 
 
 
 All these open up huge possibilities

 Controversy persists over writer Salman Rushdie not coming to Kolkata Book Fair
 salmaan rushdi kaa kahana he ki unhen aayojakon ne kolkata aane kaa nyotaa diya tha, lekin ek din pehle unhen bataaya gaya ki police ne unhen shahar main nahin aane dene kaa faisalaa kiya he
 The organizers here say that Salman Rushdie was not invited
 darasal salmaan rushdi ne apane kolkata daure ko lekar aaj bayaan diya he
 Rushdie has said that just a day before i went to Kolkata, i was told that the police had decided not to let me come to the city
 agar main jaataa, to mujhe agle hi plane se waapas bhej diya jaataa
 i was told that it was done at the behest of the Chief Minister
 tippaniyan After this, i remembered that after the Jaipur festival last year, Mamta Banerjee said that she would not let me come to Kolkata
 main bataa duun ki aayojakon ko vahaan mere aane kii puri jaankaree thi, ve mujhe bataur sarprise guest pesh karnaa chaahate the or unhone mere tikat ke paise bhi die
 Even though i am a non-resident Indian citizen, such a ban on me is shameful, while being a citizen, i have the right to come anywhere in the country

 If i had gone, i would have been sent back from the next plane
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki aisa mukhyamantri ke kehane par kiya gaya he
 The comments unhone kaha, iske baad mujhe yaad aayaa ki pichley saal jaipur mahotsav ke baad mamata banerjee ne kaha tha ki vah mujhe kolkata nahin aane dengi
 Let me tell you that the organizers were fully aware of my arrival there, they wanted to present me as a surprise guest and they also gave me the ticket money

 book:upanyaas or loktantr ( aalochana)lekhak:manager pandayakimat:395 rupepublisher:vaani prakashanpej:240manager pandeya hindi sahitya jagat main patibaddh aalochak ke rup main jane jate hai
 Even at the age of 74, he is more active than any critic, writer
 vaani prakaashan se unki ek saath paanch aalochanatmak kitaaben haal main prakashit hui hai
 After the release of the books, poet-critic Ashok Vajpayee in the regular weekly column 'kabhi-kabhaar' of 'jansatta', rightly wrote that the manager Pandey is the only critic, who has published five books simultaneously
 kavita, upanyaas, aalochana, samskruti or saakshaatkaar se sambandhit ye aalochanatmak pustaken hindi pathakon ke liye gambhir chintan kaa avasar uplabdh karaati hai
 It explores the relationship of Indian public with literature, society, and culture and establishes humanity
 ‘upanyaas or loktantr' teen khandon main vibhajit he
 The first section contains the theology of the novel
 isamen upanyaas ke itihaas, samajashaastra ke saath-saath poonjeevaad or loktantr se uske rishton kii padtaal kii gai he
 Criticism for him is not just a critique of literature, but through this he encounters religion, culture, politics and social policy directly
 arthath satta-vyavastha kaa pratipaksh rachate hue ve aalochana main nae vikalpon kii talash karaten hai 
 That is why they give the novel the status of representative mode of the third world
 asia, africa or dakshin america ke deshon main upniveshwaad or uske baad ke halaat kaa upanyaason ke madhyam se pandeya ji jayja lete hai
 He has written that 'the novel has played an important role in bringing the struggle for freedom and democracy in the society after liberation from colonialism
 asia, africa or dakshini america ke anek deshon main upniveshwaad se mukti ke baad kii shashan vyavasthaaen aisi raheen hai, jinhen aantarik upniveshwaad kahana adhik sahi hoga
 It would be more correct to call novels that reveal the truth of such systems as anti-colonial rather than calling them post-colonial
 ’manager pandeya ne anyatra likhaa he ki manushya kii paradheenata se mukti kii aakanksha or swatantraaa kii abhivyakti hi sahitya he
 They consider the novel to be the product of modern capitalist society, considering the sociology of the novel
 upanyaas ke astitv ke liye vaigyanik vikaas or vivekshil chetana jaruri he
 He writes that "the press, publications and journals necessary for the survival of the novel are the result of the scientific development of the modern era, then the working middle class capitalist social structure as its author and reader
 ' upanyaas ke saamaajik aadhaar kii khoj karte hue lekhak ne upanyaaskaar ki varg chetana, vichaardhaara or vishvadrushti kii padtaal ko jaruri mana he
 'where history is silent, literature is articulate
 ’ jis varg or samaaj ko itihaas main sthaan nahin miltaa sahitya us sthaan ko bharta he
 Manager Pandey believes that novels in the Third World are an art of realizing history
 yadhyapi upanyaas kaa janm europe main hua
 Here the novel was a supporter of bourgeois society
 lekin asia, africa or dakshin america deshon main yah upnivesh se mukti kaa aakhyaan banataa he 
 However, the novel did not develop in all the countries of the Third World
 ’ africa deshon main videshi bhashaaon se mukti kaa vimarsh or saamudayikta ko sahej kar videshi satta se mukti pramukh vishay vastu he
 The author has made a very thorough examination of the reality expressed in African and South American novels
 bhartiya upanyaason main pramukh rup se saamaajik yatharthwaad abhivyakt hua he 
 In contrast, psychological realism predominates in African novels and magical realism in South American novels
 pustak ke isi khand main pandeya ne bhartiya upanyaason main rashtrawaad ko centre main rakhkar mukhya rup se premchand or unki viraasat kii charchaa kii he 
 Actually, in Indian novels, firstly, the reality of peasant life and freedom movement is presented
 kisaan jivan ke yatharth ko abhivyakt karne vaale oriya kathakaar fakir mohan senapati kii parampara ko hindi main premchand ne viksit kiya
 Premchand added the freedom movement to it
 premchand ke uddeshy kii khoj karte hue lekhak ne likhaa he ki “ premchand kii rachanashiltaa kaa aitihaasik sandarbh swadhinata aandolan kaa tha
 The main purpose of this freedom movement was to liberate the people from domestic and foreign exploitation
 isamen janata kaa sangharsh ek saath samantvaad , poonjeevaad or videshi samrajyavad se tha
 Imperialism, nationalism and the novel almost parallel rise in the West
 ‘lekin bharat main upanyaas kaa aagaman yaa udai ek bhinn or abhishpt sthiti main hua
 Here in front of the novel was the English form of the curse of colonialism
 jiskaa virodh or pratirodh upanyaas ke bhartiya hone kii pehali shart thi
 'premchand has culturally criticized colonial India in the narrative of 1907-1947
 sevasadan , rangabhumi , godaan aadi upanyaason main abhivyakt bhartiya samaaj kii vidambnaaon or angreji samrajya ke shoshankari tantra ko aalochak ne ujagar kiya he 
 In an article titled 'legacy and Premchand of 1857', Pandey ji seeks the cause of the defeat of the movement and establishes that 'this equivalence of Premraj and Bhagat Singh's ideas of Swaraj proves that Premchand also through Bhagat Singh Connect with the tradition of 1857
 ’‘praasangikta kaa prashn or premchand kii praasangikta’isi khand main ek or mahatvapurn lekh he – ‘praasangikta kaa prashn or premchand kii praasangikta’
 In this, the critic has depicted the importance of history and literature, relations of society with literature
 kabhi nirmal verma ne kala saapeksh mulyon se premchand kii praasangikta ko kaarij kar diya tha
 Here the critic has deeply probed the secular and history-oriented ideology of Nirmal Verma and his fellow Dharma bourgeois artists
 is jan-virdohi or marxvad virdohi vichaardhaara ko asweekaar karte hue professor pandeya premchand kii praasangikta sthapit karte hai
 The literature of Premchand is relevant for opposing the present feudalism, imperialism and varnaism, as well as' An important aspect of the relevance of Premchand is that he is a progressive tradition of Hindi literature, national populist tradition of Hindi literature and realistic populist of Hindi fiction
 Is the creator of the tradition
 ’pustak kaa teesraa khand hindi ke kuch upanyaason kii vyaavhaarik samiksha par kendrit he
 In the novels of Zainendra's Sunita and Nagarjuna's 'ratinath Ki Chachi', the question of women's freedom is deeply explored
 bhartiya samaaj main dharmasatta, loksatta or pitrasatta stri paradheenata ke pradhan kaarak hai 
 In Sunita, the question of women's liberation is mental and it focuses on the man-woman relationship
 iske barakes ‘ratinath kii chachee’ main stri paradheenata kii mukti kaa prashn samjik taane-bane main piroyaa gaya he 
 This novel is a metaphor for the grief of widow Gauri in Mithila's rural society
 ek taraf isamen upanyaaskaar purohitwaad kii tikhi aalochana karata he, to duusari ore stri kii yon mukti kii vakaalat karata he
 Nagarjuna is the novelist of Premchand's tradition
 lekin premchand se adhik sthaniyata nagarjun ke yahaan he 
 The reason for this is that Nagarjuna identifies Lokmat more closely
 ‘ratinath kii chachee’ main bhartiya samaaj ke antarvirodhon ke bahut shashakt dhang se chithran hua he
 That is why it is a successful novel
 ‘sunita’ or ‘ratinath kii chachee’ upanyaason par likhane kaa kaaran samasamyik vimarsh he 
 The question of women's emancipation started long ago in the Hindi narrative
 jainendra ke bare main pandeya ji likhte hai ki pichley chaar-paanch dashakon se bhartiya samaaj main stri kii sthiti , uski paradheenata kaa prashn or swadhinata kii aakanksha se judy samasyaon par vichaar-vimarsh or rachanashiltaa kii prakriya tej hui he or vyapak bhi 
 In this context, it has to be accepted that the role of Jainendra Kumar has been a pioneer in initiating this process at the level of composition and thought 'review of Ranendra's famous novel' God of the Global Village ', the story of the community becoming a myth
 Is from the title
 jharkhand ke asur adivasee samudaay ke astitv, atmasamman or asmita kaa prashn is upanyaas main he 
 In the Vedic period, demons were killed by demonizing them, which continued through the mainstream society
 aadhunik kaal main samrajyavaadiyon or dharmik sampradayik sansthaaon kaa shikaar adivasee samudaay hua
 Pandey ji has written that in the present society one danger facing the tribal communities of India is eradication and the other is adaptation
 unmoolan kaa arth he astitv kaa ant to anukulan kaa arth he apni asmita ko khokar duusare dharmon, samskritiyon or samaajon main vilay 
 'the process of liberalization and liberalization of Hindu communalism in India is seen almost simultaneously
 adivasee samudaay khanij sampann kshetron main rahete hai
 Along with their own culture, the question of safety of water, forest and land is very important for them
 lekin vaishvikaran kii nitiyon ke chalate unke kshetron ko ujaada ja rahaa he
 Hunger, fear, somatic exploitation and displacement are his main problems
 agar ve apane adhikaron ke liye ladate hai to unhen naksali qaraar dekar maar diya jaataa he
 That is why the Asura society is continuously decreasing in number
 sanjeev ke upanyaas ‘rah gai dishaaen isi paar‘ kii samiksha karte hue aalochak ne upanyaas main abhivyakt jeevigyaan kii khojon or poonjeevaad ke gathjod ko beparda kiya he 
 How does the novel ruthlessly criticize the capitalist system and why is it necessary to read it
 pandeya likhte hai, ‘pichley kuch dashakon main jeev-vigyaan main apurv anusandhan or prayog hue hai or unki uplabdhiyaan bhi apurv hi hai 
 In this process, how much and how gruesome misuse of sex change, borrowing of womb, hormone therapy, cloning, test tube baby, artificial insemination, tissue culture etc
 to trade in current capitalism and make profit
 yah jaananaa ho to ‘rah gai dishaaen isi paar’ ko padhanaa aavashyak he or upyogi bhi 
 The critic has examined the science discourse expressed in the novel as well as the discourse of religion, society, history and philosophy
 isi tarah 1857 ke pehle swadhinata aandolan or uski asaltaaon ke kaarnon par kendrit shaad azimaabadi ke ‘pir ali’ upanyaas par ek samikshatmak lekh he
 Originally discussing the Urdu novel, the critic himself has expressed his views about the 1857 rebellion
 apane samikshatmak lekh main kathakaar madan mohan ke upanyaas ‘jahaan ek jangal tha ‘ par likhte hue unhen premchand kii parampara kaa lekhak bataaya he 
 This novel tells the plight of the lives of a tribal community of Purvanchal called Vantangia or Vanvasi
 ’ in adivaasiyon kii yatnaa kaa itihaas lambaa he 
 This exploitation, which began during the British rule, continues unabated in India as well
 manager pandeya patibaddh or prabud aalochak he
 Reviewing any of his books is a challenging task in itself
 ve siddhant or vyavhaar donon main siddhhast hai
 He has the intellectual style of Ramchandra Shukla and the subtle and intuitive language of Ram Vilas Sharma
 haalanki unhone ek jagah likhaa he ki ‘hindi upanyaas kii duniya main sachmuch loktantr tab aayaa jab stri lekhikaon ne apane upanyaason main ek ore purush-satta kaa vishleshan or chithran aarambh kiya or duusari ore stri ke sangharsh kii katha ko upanyaas ke centre main kiya
 However, she has not reviewed the novel of any female writer

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was once a star campaigner in this list, is missing
 jabaki baagi tevar apnaane vaale ashok tanvar star campanners kii list main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Aaj Tak had already told that the top leaders of Haryana Congress do not want Navjot Singh Sidhu to be sent to Haryana for campaigning because doing so may make it difficult for the public to respond to the issue of nationalism

 Apart from 40 leaders among the star campaigners, the Congress's Star Campaigners list includes interim president Sonia Gandhi and former president Rahul Gandhi, besides former prime ministers Manmohan Singh, Priyanka Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Sachin Pilot

 america raashtrapati baraak obama kii bharat yatra ke dauraan bharat-america parmaanu qaraar ko puri tarah lagu karne main 'adchanon' ko dur kar liya gaya he
 It is being claimed and said that US President Barack Obama, using his privileges, has taken another step towards India to fully implement the nuclear deal but the question still remains that American companies Are you not seeing your loss in the dealings with India? bharat-america parmaanu qaraar atomi urja ke liye hua tha taaki bharat apane parmaanu sanyantron main uranium ke istemaal se bijli banaae, in sanyantron kaa istemaal desh kii tarakkee main ho
 In order to make the US agreement with India possible, the US passed a law called the Hyde Act in December 2006 to overcome the hurdles of its constitution

 bharat kaa tark he ki ieie pehle hi nigaraanee kar rahaa he or eendhan dene ke baad america kii nigaraanee karnaa anaavashyak he
 It is being said at this point that the US President Obama has used his power to give India the assurance that the US will not demand monitoring of the uranium used in the plants
 ise bharat ke lihaaj se badi uplabdhi kaha ja rahaa he
 The second question is to buy furnaces for nuclear power plants
 saal 2010 main bana bharat kaa newclear libility kanoon kahata he ki agar parmaanu bijlighar main koi haadasa hota he or parmaanu riyector main koi khot iske liye zimmedaar he to in parmaanu bhattiyon ko supplai karne vaali company se bhi muaavze kii maang kii ja sakati he

 It is being said that now there has been talk of creating a huge fund regarding the amount of compensation
 bhartiya beemaa companiyon kii madad se koi 750 karod kaa ek fund banegaa jisamen itani hi raashi bharat sarkaar bhi jamaa karegi taaki haadasa hone kii sthiti main prabhaviton ke liye raashi kaa intazaam ho sake, lekin sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya aisa fund banane se bhartiya janata kaa paisa muaavze ke liye istemaal nahin kiya ja rahaa? is bare main abhi sarkaar ne koi blueprint aadhikarik rup se nahin bataaya he, lekin ek sawaal ye he ki kya bharat beemaa companiyon ke liye iske aarthik boj ko jhelana mumkin hoga? Experts say that even if a success has been achieved at the level of both the governments in this case, there is a doubt that American companies will sell nuclear reactors to India, because while selling these furnaces they must pay some part of the premium for compensation
 Will have to
 aise main america companiyon ko agar laga ki saude kii keemat kaaphi oonchi ho rahi he to vah peeche hat sakati hai
 By the way, it is also to understand that countries like Russia and France are ready to sell us nuclear reactors, despite not being happy with India's Liability Act
 phir ham america companiyon se riyector kharidne ke liye dabaav kyon jhel rahe hai
 The reason for this is that there have been some other agreements of nuclear agreement with America, under which India has to buy ten thousand MW nuclear equipment from America in the next few years
 isi se sawaal uth rahaa he ki agar companiyaan bharat ko parmaanu riyector nahin bechengi to kya dow manmohan singh sarkaar ke vakt hui deal adhuri rah jaaegi
 Politically too, the government may have to face resistance on this because the left parties are already openly opposing it and the Congress and other parties will also raise some questions
 upie sarkaar ke vakt jis tarah se ek majboot libility kanoon ke liye baaki dalon ke saath bijepi ne bhi sansad main awaz uthaai thi isse is mudde kaa garmana tay he
 On September 8, at the Ambedkar International Center on Janpath Road in the capital Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central officer was waiting for party president Amit Shah
 party mahasachiv or vibhinn rajyon ke prabharee apane sambandhit rajyon ke siyaasi halaat or data ke byore ke saath vahaan date the
 Prior to the start of the National Executive, Shah was keen to discuss how much the Grand Alliance is in a position to harm the party in 2019, talking to officials
 vaise, padaadhikari keval uttar pradesh, bihar, karnataka, jharkhand, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main hi vipakshi gathbandhan se milane vaali chunauti kaa zikr kar paae
 It was also mentioned that the caste equation of the parties involved in the grand alliance on 200 Lok Sabha seats can become a cause of concern for the BJP
 yah sunne ke baad shah ne sawalia lahaze main kaha, "savarnon ke andolan se party ke paramparaagat apper cast voter naaraaz hokar mahagathbandhan ke paale main ja sakate hai?''bhaajapa adhyaksh ke aisa kehete hi kuch pal ke liye baithak main sannata chaa gaya
 However, Shah himself broke this apprehensive silence and said, "BJP is sure to get more votes and more seats from last time in 2019
 ''sutron ke mutabik, shah ne baithak main do took kaha, "kis loksabhaa seat main kitne brahman, dalit yaa pichde hai, yah ginaney kaa kaam vipakshi dal yaa tathakthith mahagathbandhan ko karne den, ham to sirf yah ginen ki modi sarkaar kii chalaai gai yojanaon kaa laabh kitne gharon tak pahunchaa or kahaan pahunchnaa batch gaya he
 2019 is a battle for the BJP, not of cast (caste) but of class (class)
 '' unhone gujarat kaa udhaaharan diya or kaha ki jaateey aankade har chunaav main vipaksh ke saath prathit hue par har jati ke mahatvakankshi varg (aspireshnal class) ne aakhirkaar bhaajapa ko jeet dilaai
 Actually, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked the party leaders to work on the thinking of class voters instead of ethnic voters
 2017 main dilli main hui rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, "ab bhaajapa kaa voter garib hoga
 He said this when it was only a few months after demonetisation and many party mps were complaining that the bjp's core vote bank (businessman) had lost the party due to demonetisation
 shah ke saamne us vakt sabase badi chunauti uttar pradesh kaa chunaav tha
 Since mid-2014, the BJP was engaged in full strength to benefit the government schemes for the poor in Uttar Pradesh
 isamen ujjwala jaisi yojanaon ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai or bhaajapa ko pradesh main kamyaabi mili
 According to the sources, Shah also mentioned in a meeting with the officials that the manner in which the voices were emerging after demonetisation from inside and outside the party that the business classes have lost to the BJP, the same way can now be mentioned
 Used to be
 is saal 20 march ko essi / asti act ko lekar supreme court ke faisle ke baad kaha jane laga ki vah samudaay bhaajapa se chhitak gaya
 But the BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Karnataka elections
 ab essi / asti act ko sansad ke jariye puraane swaroop main laayaa gaya to kaha jane laga he ki savarna bhaajapa se chhitakenge
 Shah has clearly told party officials that there is no point in putting energy into the practice of caste mathematics
 pichley lagbhag saadhe chaar saal main sabhi jatiyon ke vot bhaajapa ko mili hai
 The main reason for this is the voter of aspirational class
 bhaajapa kaa yahi kor vot he, jise saadhane ke liye jaruri he ki centre kii modi sarkaar or rajyon kii bhaajapa sarkaron kii lok kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh in logon ko mili
 According to sources, Shah cited the election figures in the last ten years and said that every party has been getting votes of every caste in every election
 yah aage bhi hota rahegaa
 According to him, the general math is that in the last few years, there has been a section of voters who vote on the performance of the governments
 yahi tabaka bhaajapa kii sabase badi takat he jo mahagathbandhan kii jaateey ganit par baari padegaa
 However, the Congress believes that the voters of different castes have become angry with the BJP and its government, so it has to devise such a strategy
 congress media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep surajevaala kehete hai, "darasal bhaajapa ko yah pataa chal chukaa he ki samaaj kaa har tabaka chaahe vah kisi jati yaa varg kaa ho, bhaajapa kii jhooth kii raajnneeti ko samaj gai he or iskaa uttar bhaajapa ko 2019 main milegaa
 Will be found in every state
 ''isliye jaruri he aakankshapurna voterbhajapa kaa akalan he ki mahagathbandhan kii sthiti main agar party jaateey ganit ko saadhane main naakaam rah gai to party ko nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 The party president himself also directly and indirectly believes that if the sp-bsp-congress and RLD join the BJP in Uttar Pradesh against the BJP, then the BJP will suffer
 lekin party ke paas ab na to itnaa vakt he, na hi party ke paas aise log hai jo vibhinn jatiyon ko bhaajapa ke saath jod saken, jaisaa ki khud party mahasachiv or uttar pradesh kaa prabharee rahete hue shah ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kiya tha
 He made the BJP reach among the various castes
 natijatan, party apane dam par rajya ke 80 main se 71 seat jeetne main safal rahi thi
 In such a situation, bjp's eyes and hopes are on those who have benefited from the actions of the Modi government
 shah kehete hai, "bahut jaldi 10 karod pariwaron ko arthath lagbhag 50 karod logon ko ayushmaan bharat ke tahat swasthya suraksha daayre main laayaa jayega, jinhen 5 lakh rupye tak kaa muft swasthya beemaa milegaa
 Those who remain concerned about the health of their parents or family, irrespective of their caste, will have their hopes fulfilled
 is tarah ke aspireshan rakhane vaale log bhaajapa ko vot karenge
 "the BJP says that the votes of the constituents of the Grand Alliance should not be transferred to each other, but those who will get the benefit of health insurance will definitely give priority to the party which has fulfilled their wishes
" shah ke mutabik, 126 se adhik lok-kalyankari yojanaon ke tahat pehle se hi 50 karod se adhik logon ko laabh pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 5 under the Ujjwala scheme
 5 karod gas silendar vitarit kiye gaye hai
 Every section of the society that wanted to get rid of the wood stove has fulfilled the wishes of most of them
 ghar kii chahat rakhane waalon kaa bhi ek tabaka he jisamen har jati ke log hai
 The Modi government has built 1 crore houses and the BJP is trying to have everyone own a house by the year 2022
 sava do karod gharon main bijli pahunchaai gai he
 More than 18 crore poor children and pregnant women have been vaccinated through Mission Indradhanush
 65 hajaar gaanvon main 7 lok-kalyankari yojanaon ko ekadam safaltaapurvak chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Shah says, "before 2019 Lok Sabha elections, all seven public welfare schemes will be implemented 100 percent in 1 lakh 20 thousand villages
 ''par aasaan nahin raahbhaajapa bhale hi jati kii jagah class voter kii baat kar rahi he lekin class vot bank kii raah aasaan nahin he
 The statistics testify that the BJP may have achieved great success in the last Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, but if the total votes of sp-bsp-congress and RLD are added, then the aspirational class voters of the BJP will not stand anywhere
 bhaajapa ko 2014 main 42
 63 per cent of the votes were received, while SP-BSP and Congress votes are added, it is 6 per cent more than the BJP
 karnataka main bhi yahi haal he
 In 2014, BJP took 43 percent of the vote while Congress and JD (S) shared vote share of around 52 percent
 duusari mahatvapurn baat yah he ki jo lok kalyankari yojanaayen chal rahi hai unako lekar bhi kaaphi shikaayatein hai jo bhaajapa ke khilaaf ja rahi hai
 In the most successful Ujjwala scheme, people are now having trouble in filling the cylinder
 logon ke paas itane paise nahin hai ki ve dobaaraa gas silendar bharva saken
 Surjewala says, "if the BJP is talking about the aspirational class, then explain to the people of that class why the price of diesel-petrol is at the highest height for the first time? Why are gas cylinders expensive? What happened to demonetisation? Rafael But why is there silence? What are the benefits of GST? Are petrol and diesel prices low, is it not the aspiration of the aspirational class? Farmers should not commit suicide, does this thinking class in society Is not it? '' Of course, the BJP is running bets regardless Spireshnl class, but his path is not easy

 The government was getting a lot of condemnation for the manner in which Rajaballabh Yadav got bail from Patna High Court and the Opposition also started pressuring the Bihar government, showing the attacking attitude, that it was supreme to dismiss Rajaballabh Yadav's bail
 Appeal to the court
 iske baad bihar sarkaar ne rajballabh kii bel ko khaarij karne ke liye supreme court main yachika daali thi
 While hearing the case, the Supreme Court rejected the bail of Rajaballabh Yadav and gave him time till Wednesday to surrender in the court

 We demand that the entire case be tried soon and the accused MLA should be hanged

 aalia bhatta or ranbir kapur ke links-aps kii khabaron se gocip galiyara gulzaar ho gaya he
 And anyway why not everyone wants to see these good looking and single stars of Bollywood in relation together
 aalia khud ranbir par apane krash ko jag jaahir kar chuki hai
 Now the pair are going to be seen together in the upcoming movie Brahmastra and with this, the news of their affair is also in the discussions
 ek chat sho ke dauraan diziner manish malhotra ne haal hi main saal 2018 kii link ap jodi aalia or ranbir ko hi bataaya he
 The name of Alia, who was associated with this billionaire businessman, was met, however, according to a report published in Filmfare about the relationship between Alia and Ranbir, director Ayan Mukherjee is being blamed for the rumors of the link up of these two stars
 reports kii maane to film brahmastra ke diarector ayaan mukherjee hi chaahate the ki aalia or ranbir ek duusare ke saath zyada se zyada samay bitaayen taaki donon film ke liye ek duusare ke saath comfortable ho jaaen
 So that the on-screen chemistry of these actors is natural

 summerset ke saath 15 july ko khele gaye teen divasiy abhyaas match ke saath bharat kaa jo england daura shuru hua tha, uskaa samaapan shuukravaar ko cardiff ke sophia gardens maidan par hoga
 India has not won a single international match in this series so far
 is jeet kii use shuukravaar ko bhi talash rahegi kyonki yah uske jakhmon par maraham kaa kaam karegi
 India have lost the only Twenty20 match, two odis and one practice match apart from the four-match Test series on the England tour

 In the remaining seven, the Indian team has lost

 This match will be special for former India captain and one of his most trusted batsmen Rahul Dravid as it will put an end to Dravid's international ODI career
 dravid ne do varsh ke antaraal ke baad ekadivasiy team main chune jane ke baad hi ghoshnaa kar di thi ki england ke saath khele jane vaale paanch muqablon ke saath unka ekadivasiy kariyar samaapt ho jayega
 Dravid will however remain in the Test team
 cardiff main kya hoga, kaha nahin ja saktaa
 If the batting that was seen in the Indian batting in the fourth ODI played at Lord's Stadium on September 11, the Indian team can win on the strength of the batsmen but if it comes to protecting the target then the bowlers can spoil the work
 Because his performance in Lords was very disappointing
 duusari ore, english team ke liye koi chintaa kii baat nahin he
 He has certainly suffered some losses due to Stuart Broad being ruled out due to injury, but this will be short-lived by his strong bench strength
 ballebaaji or kshetrarakshan main english team bharat kii tulana main ab tak bees rahi he or jahaan tak gendbaaji kii baat he to is shrinkhalaa ke lihaaj se donon tiimon ke bich tulana karnaa bemaani hoga
 The English team won the Test series on the strength of its bowlers and now has an edge in the ODI series
 bhartiya team ke haath se shrinkhalaa jeetne kaa mauka nikal chukaa he
 In such a situation, his players will want to perform their best without getting into the field without any fear and fear
 parthiv patel or anjiky rehane ne kaaphi had tak acchhee shuruyaat kii jimmedaari nibhaai he lekin madhyakram beete teen maichon main naakaam rahaa he
 Captain Dhoni and Suresh Raina showed their batsmen's thrust at Lord's, they will have to continue and at the same time Virat Kohli will have to go ahead and strengthen the team
 dravid par antim match main acchhee pari khilne kii jimmedaari hogi or unke saath jeet ke saath unhen vidaai dena chahenge

 70 per cent of Delhi government's income comes from VAT, which is collected from traders and traders
 dilli sarkaar ko waite se salanaa kareeb 20 hazaar karod kii aamadani hoti he, lekin mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne isko 30 hazaar karod karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he or iske liye adhikariyon ko ection plan lekar aane ke liye kaha gaya he
 This means that with this additional 10 thousand crore rupees annually, Kejriwal will fulfill the dreams which he showed to the people of Delhi
 waite collection main sidhe-sidhe itani badhotaree kaise hogi, isko lekar vyapaariyon main atakalon kaa bazaar garm he
 On Tuesday, BJP leader Vijender Gupta in the Delhi Assembly said that there was a stir among traders and the government should clear the picture on this
 jawaab main siem kejariwal ne dilli vidhansabha main bataaya ki lakshya 20,000 karod se badhaakar 30,000 karod rakhaa gaya he, lekin iske liye koi red nahin hogi or na hi vyapaariyon par koi boj daalaa jayega, balki vyapaariyon se baat karke or sahmati se hi tex collection badhaayaa jayega
 Kejriwal argued that last time when he was CM, the kind of atmosphere he gave to the traders by not doing any raid on the traders, it was because of this that an additional record VAT collection of about 1,000 crores was done during that time
 kejariwal ne kaha, "ummid he ki agar ham vyapaariyon ko gale lagaakar or unako suraksha kii bhaavana den, to 30,000 karod to kya 60,000 karod kaa lakshya bhi puraa ho saktaa he

 On 31 July, he told the BJP workers that "we have decided to keep the alliance
" media ko jo chaahe anumaan lagane dijie
 Army chief Uddhav Thackeray has expressed similar sentiments, but he claims that the BJP has promised him equal participation in power

 "I know this because i was present in the meeting at which the promise was made," he told reporters
 us samay vahaan mere alaava keval teen log—uddhavji, devendraji or amitbhai (shah)—maujuud the
 On the other hand, according to a source close to Fadnavis, the seats will be divided by formula for the 288-member house
 abhi jin siton par in dalon kaa kadbraja he—bhaajapa kii 122 or shivasena kii 63—un par koi vivaad nahin he
 Of the remaining 103 seats, the smaller parties of the NDA — the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, the Republican Party of India and the Shiv Sangram — will be given one seat each
 shesh 100 siton ko bhaajapa or shivasena ke bich samaan rup se vitarit kiya jayega
 This means that BJP will contest 172 and Shiv Sena 113 seats

 This is the condition of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at this time
 navaj sharif ke saamne sabase bada sawaal apni pasand ke shaks ko pakistan kaa aglaa senadhyaksh bananaa he
 On this issue, the tussle between Nawaz Sharif and the current Pakistan Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel Sharif, continues
 general raahil kaa kaarykaal november main puraa hone ja rahaa he
 According to India's high-level intelligence reports, Nawaz wants his trusted officer to command the Pakistani army
 vahiin general raahil kaa puraa jor he ki unki pasand kaa afasar aglaa army chif bane
 In Pakistan, the Chief of Army Staff is considered an important center of power
 bharat or america ko lekar pakistan kii policy tay karne kaa haq maujuuda senadhyaksh general raahil ke haath main hi mana jaataa he
 General Raheel's choice is Lieutenant General Jubeir Mahmood Hayat
 hayaat is vakt rawalpindi army headquarter main chif of general staff hai
 This post is considered important to reach the post of Army Chief
 raahilki tarah hayaat kaa sambandh bhi faujee kunbe se hi rahaa he
 Hayat's three brothers are also high officials in the Pakistani army
 maujuuda post par tainaati se pehle hayaat pakistan kii stratagic plance divijan ke pramukh rah chuke hai
 On top of this division, Pakistan has the responsibility of maintaining nuclear weapons
 leftinent general hayaat kaa duusare deshon ke liye drushtikon kya he, ye abhi tak parde ke peeche chupa he
 But India's intelligence apratus believes that Hayat is more fanatical than General Raheel, the current army chief
 navaj kii pasand leftinent general javedhyaat par general raahil kaa daanv he to vahiin pradhanmantri navaj kii pasand leftinent general javed ikbaar raamde hai
 Ramde is currently the Corps Commander of the XXXI Corps
 bataa den ki navaj sharif ne general musharraf ko bhi kai general ko supersid kar pakistani fouj kaa chif banaaya tha
 But in 1999, General Musharraf himself took over the government of Pakistan by overthrowing Nawaz Sharif
 intelegence reports ke mutabik leftinent general raamde kaa parivaranwaj sharifki party pakistan muslim neshnal lig (piemenel) se pichley kai varshon se judaa hua he
 General Ramde's name came to the limelight in 2009 when he led the Pakistani army operations in the Swat Valley near the border of Afghanistan
 general nadeem-leftinent general bajva main resabharat ke intelegence akalan ke mutabik leftinent general raamde par navaj sharif ko puraa bharosa he
 Who will become the next Army Chief of Pakistan, a lot will be based on how Nawaz will hold the country's defense and foreign affairs
 jahaan tak maujuuda senadhyaksh general raahil kaa sawaal he to wo parde ke peeche rahakar hi daanv khelte rahe hai
 At the same time, he has also been strengthening his hold in the domestic politics of Pakistan
 bhartiya intelegence reports ke mutabik pakistani sena kaa chif banane ke liye do or leftinent general ke naam hode main maane ja rahe hai
 These are Lieutenant General Isfaq Nadeem Ahmed and Lieutenant General Qamar Bajwa
 mana ja rahaa he ki navaj or general raahil main apni-apni pasand ke afasar ke naam par sahmati nahin banati he to leftinent general nadeem yaa leftinent general bajva main kisi ek ko aglaa senadhyaksh banane par muhar lag sakati he
 Lt Gen Nadeem is currently the Corps Commander of 2 Corps in Multan while Lt Gen Bajwa is heading the Training and Evaluation Wing of the Pakistan Army
 pakistan ke pichley do army chif kii baat kii jaae to general musharraf or general kiyani donon ko kaarykaal khatm hone par vistaar mila tha
 Pakistan's current Army Chief General Raheel has publicly made it clear that he is not willing to take an extension after his term ends
 general raahil ke mutabik ritairement ke baad wo apane pushtaini ghar main rahanaa pasand karenge
 Despite General Sharif's stand, the campaign in Pakistan is gaining momentum that he should get an extension in tenure
 kaaphi charchit rahe rahilpakistan main ab tak jitne bhi army chif hue hai, unamem general raahil ko sabase zyada popular bataakar prachaarit kiya jaataa he
 General Raheel started the zarb-e-azb operation against the tehrik-e-taliban militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (north West Frontier Province), bypassing the opposition of the government of Pakistan
 iske baad kai maheene tak soshal media par # thank you raahil sharif trend hota rahaa tha
 Intelligence agencies of India believe that the hype regarding General Raheel was done by the Public Relations Wing of the Pakistani Army
 is wing ko inter services public relations (aisapiaar) ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 General Raheel's loyalty as a soldier is also appreciated in India
 bharat sarkaar main ucch pad par tainaat ek adhikari ne 'india today / aaj tak' ko bataaya, 'general raahil peshewar sainik hai, jo rashtriyata or apane parivaar kii sainik viraasat ke liye majboot bhavanaaen rakhte hai
 They will not do anything so that there is an agreement on the Pakistani army's hold on the security of the country

 What is CBI - Associate or investigator of bad people
 
 
 bahut dukh kii baat he ki sibiai kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uth rahe hai
 
 
 15 years ago it was rock-like, now it has become like sand
 
 
 " koyala ghotaale se jude maamalon kii sunwaayee ke dauraan yah tippanee 8 may, 2013 ko supreme court ne sibiai diarector ranjit sinha ke bare main kii
 
 
 The Supreme Court was angry about why Sinha showed the investigation report of the coal scam to the Law Minister and other top government officials, so that they got the changes in the investigation report
 
 
 jate-jate bhi 'pinjre main band is tote' ko supreme court se phir jhatka mila
 Just 12 days before retirement, the Supreme Court directed Ranjit Sinha to recuse himself from the 2-G spectrum case
 
 
 court ne visitor diary ke mutabik ranjit sinha kii aaropee se hui 90 mulakaaton kaa khulaasa hone ke baad yah nirdesh diya tha
 
 
 This was not the first time Ranjit Sinha was removed from any investigation
 
 
 isse pehle varsh 1996 main patna hoicourt ne bhi unhen chaara ghotaale kii jaanch se alag kar diya tha, kyonki un par lalu prasad yadav kii madad karne kaa aarope laga tha
 
 
 It was said that Sinha changed the investigation report for Lalu Yadav
 
 
 sibiai diarector kii kaaryastylee par samay-samay par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 
 
 Sometimes himself, sometimes under pressure from mentors, he influenced the investigation many times
 
 
 purv sibiai diarector joginder singh ne kaha tha ki un par lalu yadav ke khilaaf jaanch dhimi karne kaa dabaav tha
 
 
 Former director BR Lal, who is investigating the Bhopal gas tragedy, alleged that he was asked not to press for extradition of Warren Anderson, chairman of Union Carbide Corporation, the main accused in the tragedy
 
 
 sibiai par yah bhi aarope laga tha ki usne boforce scandle ke mukhya aaropee ottavio kwatrochi kii madad kii thi
 
 
 How the then Central Government misused the CBI and gained the support of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati, the allegations had been in the discussion for a long time
 
 
 do saal kii job security hone ke baavjood sibiai ke diarector dabaav main kyon aa jate hai
 
 
 The The reason is the same, CBI is not an independent institution
 
 
 sibiai na sanvaidhanik he or na vaidhanik he
 
 
 It works under the Department of Personnel and Training
 
 
 iskaa matlab, sibiai ke adhikariyon ko niyukt karne, transfar karne or nilambit karne kaa adhikaar carmik or prashikshan vibhaag ke paas he, or zaahir he, vibhaag kaa mukhiya koi mantri hi hoga
 
 
 In such a situation, the director of CBI will come under the influence of his boss

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, captain of Team India and student of St
 Xavier's College, Ranchi, has a lot of fame and money, but it seems that his luck does not have to be called a graduate
 
 
 darasal, college main somvaar ko varsh 2011 ke chaatro ke bich degree kaa vitaran ho rahaa he, lekin ek bhi cemester paas nahin kar paane ke kaaran dhoni kaa naam suchi main nahin he
 
 
 So, Dhoni was again denied a Bachelor degree
 
 
 gauratlab he ki mahendra singh dhoni ne shyamali ke ranchi jawahar vidya mandir se 10veen kaksha uteern karne ke baad ranchi ke hi gossionar college se commers main inter kii pariksha uteern kii thi, lekin cricket main kariyar banane ke chalate vah aage kii padhai nahin kar paae
 
 
 Then, after a gap of seven-eight years, he enrolled for a Bachelor's degree (course 2008-2011) in the Office of Administration and Secretarial Practice course under Vocational Studies at St
 Xavier's College, Ranchi in 2008, but exceedingly in cricket
 He was unable to pass a single semester out of six due to busyness
 
 
 tippaniyan Now Dhoni might not be able to graduate, because his registration will also end this year
 
 
 vaise jevirs college ne dhoni ko sabhi tarah kii suvidhaayen de rakhi thim
 
 
 For example, it was not compulsory for him to come to college, and he could take the exam from anywhere as per his convenience, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not appear in any of the six semesters
 
 
 jab dhoni ke bare main jevirs college ke principal fadar nicholas tete se baat kii gai, to unhone kaha ki agar dhoni bhi graduates kii is suchi kaa hissaa hote to kaaphi khushi hoti
 
 
 The rest of the students of Xavier's College are also sure that the name of the Indian captain is not with them in this list, but they are also happy that Dhoni is illuminating the name of the country in India and abroad

 ab dhoni shaayad graduate ho hi nahin paaenge, kyonki unka registration bhi is saal khatm ho jayega
 
 
 By the way, Xavier's College had given all the facilities to Dhoni
 
 
 masalan, unke liye college aana anivaary nahin tha, or vah apni suvidhanusaar kahin se bhi pariksha de sakate the, lekin mahendra singh dhoni ne chah main se kisi ek cemester main bhi pariksha nahin di
 
 
 When Dhoni was spoken to Xavier College Principal Father Nicholas Tete, he said that it would have been a great pleasure if Dhoni were also part of this list of graduates
 
 
 jevirs college ke baaki chaatro ko bhi is baat kaa malaal zarur he ki bhartiya captain kaa naam unke saath is list main nahin he, lekin unhen is baat kii khushi bhi he ki dhoni desh-videsh main desh kaa naam roshan kar rahe hai

 The Election Commission banned the election campaign in West Bengal from 10 pm on Thursday night
 chunaav ayog ke is faisle par vipakshi dalon ne sawaal uthaane bhi shuru kar die
 Opposition parties said that the Election Commission only did this because Prime Minister Modi has two election rallies in West Bengal during the day
 agar chunaav ayog ne prachaar par bain lagaaya he to subah se hi kyon nahin
 Now on this entire matter, the Election Commission has given the reason behind this decision

 But if proper action is not taken, he has been removed from the election process by issuing transfer orders
 'unhone kaha, 'agar ye adhikari ayog ke aadesh kii avhelnaa karte hai, to ayog unke nilamban kii sifarish bhi grih or carmik mantralay se kar saktaa he
 'it is hot in the corridors of the political and home ministry that the ADG of West Bengal can come and make excuses in coming to Delhi to join a new place

 dilli main anaadhikrut coloniyon par credit lene ko lekar bijepi or sattadhari aam aadmi party aamane-saamne aa gai hai
 The BJP once again exposed Kejriwal as the leader of lies with regard to unauthorized colonies
 darasal dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko press conference kar ye elaan kiya tha ki ab anadhikrut coloniyon main bhi log registry kara sakenge
 BJP termed Kejriwal as a liar and alleged that the AAP government did nothing about unauthorized colonies during its four-year tenure
 lekin jab modi sarkaar ne is par jor diya or centre sarkaar kii nitiyon kii vajah se hi ye sambhav ho paaya to credit lene khud chale aae
 State BJP President Manoj Tiwari said, 'CM Arvind Kejriwal is spreading confusion about unauthorized colony
 jabaki yah modi sarkaar he, jisane in coloniyon ke logon kii chintaa karte hue use malikana haq dilaane ke liye kai faisle kiye hai

 paris ne twitor par apane lakhon folowaron ko die apane sandesh main likhaa tha, ‘‘mujhe is baat ko lekar hairat he ki aansu namakeen kyon hote hai?’’ Paris wrote in her message to her millions of followers on Twitter, "I am surprised as to why tears are salty?" assam ke naugaanv jile ke dhing main 12 april ko yojit ek raily main ol india united democratic front (eiudief) ke mukhiya moulana badaruddin ajmal ne sawaal kiya, ''tarun gogoi he koun?ʼʼ ek hi din pehle eiudief ne bodoland teritorial council ke chunaavon main chaar siten jiti thim or congress ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki thi
 At Dhing's rally, Ajmal was actually replying to Gogoi's sarcasm after a decade: On the occasion of the AIUDF being set up in 2005, the chief minister asked, "badruddin Ajmal hai kaun?" Since the formation of Bodo parties in 2004 It may not be enough to win four seats in the dominated 40-member council, but since 2009, Dhubri MP Ajmal has his own reasons for boasting
 pehali he rajya bhar ke apane virodhiyon kii tulana main unki ''kamyaabi kii darʼʼ eiudief ne keval aath ummidavaar khadey kiye the-chaar muslim or chaar bodo-jinamein se do muslim or do bodo jeet gaye, jabaki 35 se zyada siton par ummidavaar utaarne ke baavjood congress ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki or bijepi ko keval ek seat se santosh karnaa padaa
 Second, in Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) (where violent clashes between Bodos and Muslim immigrants have become commonplace in the region), winning seats has political significance, as it claims their Muslim immigrants to be "great keepers"
 Gets strength

 Nani Gopal Mahant, who teaches political science at Guwahati University, says, "both Congress and BJP are unlikely to get a clear majority, so Ajmal is set to play the role of kingmaker
" ʼʼajmal ke jabardast ubhaar ke peeche unki apni siyaasi sooyeeboojh ke alaava halaat kaa bhi acha-khaasaa yogadan he
 The AIUDF was formed in 2005, the same year the Supreme Court repealed the controversial Illegal Immigrant (determination by Tribunal) Act (IMDT)
 iske liye ol assam students union ke netaa or bijepi ke maujuuda kendriya mantri sarbanand sonoval ne lambii kanoonee ladaai ladi thi, jiske baad adaalat kaa yah faisla aayaa tha
 The IMDT law placed the responsibility of identifying illegal immigrants on tribunals and placed the burden of proving citizenship of the suspects on the complainants
 apravasi musalmaan maanate hai ki centre kii tatkaaleen congress sarkaar kaa banaaya gaya yah kanoon unhen utpeedan se bachaane vaala tha
 In a visit to the Barak Valley in 2011, Chief Minister Gogoi said that he would "protect Hindu immigrants"
 isse ajmal ko muslim apravasiyon ke haq main khadey hone kaa mauka mil gaya
 The AIUDF won only 10 seats in the 2006 election, but in the 2011 election it won 18 seats in Bengali-speaking Muslim constituencies
 isi ke saath party assam kii siyasat main mukhya virdohi dal ke taur par ubhar ai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it won three seats and led in 24 assembly segments, whereas in 2009 it had only one seat
 20 april ko gogoi ne nuksaan kii bharpai karne ke liye kaha ki kharaab halaat kii vajah se gaiyr-kanoonee taur par assam main daakhil hue bangladeshiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta de deni chahie
 But Mahanta says, "muslims can never forgive the Congress for not taking the IMDT law and not taking appropriate steps to stop repeated slaughter in the BTDA
" ʼʼajmal in aaropon ko khaarij kar dete hai ki unki party ek samudaay vishesh ke hiton kii raksha karti he
 They present figures in support of their claim
 2006 main eiudief ne 73 ummidavaar utaare the, jinamein se 34 gaiyr-musalmaan the
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, AIUDF contested 11 seats, of which six were non-muslim candidates
 jeetne vaale teen ummidavaaron main se ek radheshyaam biswas hindu hai
 The acting president of the party, Drs
 aditya langathasa dimsa adivasee hai
 But Ajmal's claim to be inclusive does not match his attitude of playing minority cards
 unke taaja nishane par rashtriya naagarikta register ko apadet karne kii prakriya he, jo april main shuru kii gai he
 At a rally in Howli in Barpeta district, he thundered and said, "this is a conspiracy to make 40 lakh Muslims in Assam illegal citizens
" ʼʼrashtriya naagarikta register ke kaam ko puraa karne ke liye supreme court ne rajya sarkaar ko disambar, 2016 tak kaa vakt diya he or vidhansabha chunaav bhi 2016 ke ant tak hone hai
 Therefore, the issue of updating the citizenship register on the electoral board is seen to be loud

 Fazil (equivalent to a master's degree in Islamic theology and Arabic) from Darul Uloom Deoband, Maulana Ajmal understands the political multiplicity well and uses every arrow in his quiver to woo Muslims

 His supporters claim that drinking this water cures every disease

 isisi world cap 2015 main hissaa lene vaale sabhi 14 cricket board ne apni-apni team kaa elaan kar diya he
 If this announcement brought good news to many players, many felt disappointed
 aaj kii taarikh main team chayan se bharat ke yuvaraj singh, westeindies ke dwen braavo or kirone pollard sabase zyada niraashaa honge
 There will also be desperate England captain Alastair Cook, who was shown a way out of the team
 unhen kharaab pradarshan kii keemat chukaani padi
 His fans were angered by the decision not to select Yuvraj
 anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki dwen braavo or pollard ko cricket board se contract vivaad ke kaaran bharat daura bich main hi chhodane kii sajaa mili he
 Let's take a look at some such cricketers
 
 
 1
 Hopes were raised about Yuvraj Singh being selected in the team after scoring three centuries for Punjab in the Yuvraj Singhranji Trophy
 laga tha ki form main vaapasi ke saath unki team main bhi vaapasi ho jaaegi
 Although he was not named among the 30 probables selected for the World Cup, but his chances were increased due to Ravindra Jadeja's injury
 par yuvi or cricket prashansakon ke haath niraashaa lagi
 The selectors did not give him a chance keeping in mind the future arguments of the team
 aapako bataa den ki yuvaraj singh pichley world cap main player of da toornament rahe the
 2
 dwen brawbhi kuch maheene pehle kii hi to baat he jab dwen braavo westeindies vanade team kii captaini kar rahe the
 He was also the team's first choice as an all-rounder
 par unhen westeindies cricket board ke saath contract vivaad kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 Angered by his stubborn attitude, the board showed him the way out of the team and told him who the real boss was
 aapako bataa den ki pement vivaad ke kaaran westeindies team bharat daure ko bich main chhodkar waapas laut gai thi
 3
 kirone pollardis visphotak ballebaaj ne bhale hi pichley 6 maheene main balle yaa gend se koi khaas kamaal nahin kiya ho, lekin unke jaise pratibhashali khilaadi ko world cap main nazarandaaj karne kii galati koi nahin karnaa chahega
 But he is not part of the West Indies team
 aisa lagata he ki unhen contract vivaad main braavon kaa samarthan karne kaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 4
 jimi nishamanujiland cricket board ke chayankartaaon ne team main olerounder ke taur par jimi nisham kii jagah grant aliot par zyada bharosa dikhaaya
 Shockingly, Eliot played his last ODI in 2013
 vahiin, nisham lagaataar hi kiwi team kaa hissaa bane rahe
 During this he also gave some good performances
 par board ko aliot kii daavedaari zyada majboot najar ai
 5
 kamran akmalalambe samay se pakistan ke liye wicket ke peeche morcha sanbhaalane vaale wicketiper kamran akmal shaayad apane kariyar ke aakhri padaav par hai
 They would hope that PCB would prioritize their experience in important tournaments like World Cup
 lekin maujuuda wicketiper sarfaraj ahamed kaa pradarshan itnaa bhi bura nahin rahaa he ki team main unki jagah kamran ko de di jaae
 6
 reyaan harisreyaan haris ko australia team main shaamil nahin karnaa hairaani bharaa faisla he, kyonki haal ke dinon is tej gendbaaj ne jabardast pradarshan kiya he
 Perhaps fitness came in the way of his dream to play the World Cup
 mukhya chayankarta road marsh ne bataaya ki ve 35 varshiya haris kaa istemaal agle maheene hone vaale vishwa cap main turup ke pattey ke taur par kar sakate the lekin ve chaahate hai ki yah tej gendbaaj agali ashes siries ke liye puri tarah se feet rahe
 7
 ajanta mendisek vakt par mistry spinner maane jane vaale srilanka ke ajanta mendis kaa kariyar hi mistry banane ke kagaar par he
 After not being selected for the ICC World Cup, serious questions have been raised about his career
 8
 Saeed Ajmalpakistan's off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was banned from bowling by the ICC due to questionable action
 is faisle ke baad ajmal ne apane ection main sudhaar karne kii bhi koshish kii, lekin vah isamen puri tarah se safal nahin ho sake
 The PCB also did not give him a place in the team
 world cap jaise ahm toornament main pakistan ko ajmal jaise ghaatak spinner kii kami jarur khalegi
 9
 elistare kukengland and wales cricket board (isibi) ne haal ke vanade shrinkhalaaon main apni team ke kharaab pradarshan ko dekhte hue elistare cook ko na sirf captain pad se hataa diya, balki unhen vishwa cap team main bhi jagah nahin di
 Cook's batting form in odis has also not been special
 chaahe gharelu pich hon yaa phir videshi, cook har paristhiti main jujhate najar aae
 10
 umr gulpakistan ke sabase anbhavi tej gendbaaj umr gul abhi ghutane kii chot se puri tarah nahin ubar paae or is vajah se vishwa cap team ke liye unke naam par vichaar bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Gul underwent a knee operation in Melbourne last year
 iske baad gul puri fitness hasil nahin kar paae
 Pakistan is determined to be their villain

 20 rupee kharch karne vaala vyakti garib nahin he
 Earlier, the commission had said that a person spending more than Rs 32 per day in urban areas is not poor
 uski is gananaa se kaaphi vivaad paidaa hua tha
 The poverty figure given by the Planning Commission is based on the same calculation method
 isamen kaha gaya he ki pichley saat saal main desh main garibon kii sankhya ghati he
 The commission said that the all-india poverty line would be Rs 4,080 monthly for rural areas and Rs 5,000 monthly in cities according to consumption expenditure in a family of five

 fortis jaise bade or nijee aspataal main 15 dinon tak ilaaj hone ke baavjood ek 7 saal kii bacchee kii dengue se maut ho gai
 The hospital paid a bill of 18 lakhs to the parents in return for the treatment of the girl child
 ausat karke dekhen to prati din 1 lakh rupee se bhi zyada kaa kharch
 Now the question is that if this private hospital has made such a big bill for the treatment of dengue, then what will be the bill in some other big disease
 is par punjab or haryana hoicourt bhi hairaan he
 Taking suo moto cognizance of this case, the court appointed senior advocate of the High Court, Anupam Gupta as a court friend

 *** nayaa saal siyaasi dalon ke liye apni takat aajamaane kaa saal he
 This year can also be called the semi-final of political riot
 gujarat or himachal ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan is saal 8 rajyon ke chunaav ke liye qamar kas rahi hai
 But, the new year is also a year of changing roles
 gujarat main kadi takkar de chuki congress hi nahin, baaki kii partiyaan soft-hindutv kaa daaman tham rahi hai
 On the one hand, it is Siddaramaiah, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, who said in public meeting that he is a Hindu
 unhone apane naam main ram ke jude hone kaa hawala diya or kaha ki sirf bhaajapa ke log hi hindu nahin hai
 Now Assembly elections are due in Karnataka in March itself
 soobe main kareeb 85 fisadi hindu voter hai
 20% of these people are Lingayats, worshipers of Lord Shiva
 duusari taraf, gujarat main rahul gandhi ke baaise mandiron kii puja-archana khabaron main rahi hi thi
 This means that the Congress is trying to break its anti-hindutva image
 yaad kariye, jab go-vadh ke khilaaf desh bhar main bhaajapaiyo ne hawa banaai to kerala main yuva congress ke kuch kaaryakartaaon ne khuleam bachade kaa maance banaaya or khaaya tha
 This was harmful for the Congress because even the secular to secular Hindu refrains from openly saying something about beef
 yah baat or he ki bhaajapa ke apane shashan vaale rajyon main bif ko lekar alag kism kii rassa-kassi he
 In fact, now all parties are eyeing Hindu voters
 gujarat main, bhaajapa modi ke karishme ke boote sarkaar or saakh bachaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 But we have to agree that the Congress gave a tough fight by adopting soft Hindutva
 ab is formule ko aage badhaate hue congress gujarat main 148 ram mandiron main puja kit baantne vaali he
 Any party, even the Trinamool Congress, which shows itself to be quite secular and wants to get out of this charge
 pashchim bengal main pichley kuch maheenon main hue sampradayik vivaadon main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee par musalamaanon ke paksh main khadey hone ke aarope lag rahe hai
 The controversy over immersion between Durga Puja and Muharram alleged that she was engaged in Muslim appeasement
 ab mukul roy party chhodkar bhaajapa main ja chuke hai to mamata ko apane vot bank saadhane kii yaad ai he
 In such a situation, he first started the scheme of giving cow to the rearers and now Anubrata Mandal, considered close to him, distributed the Gita of eight thousand Brahmins at the Brahmin Conference in Virbhum district
 saath main alag uphaar bhi the
 Mamta too has already declared herself a Hindu
 asal main, is kavayad ke peeche kii vajah jaananaa koi rocket science nahin he
 The BJP has already started preparing for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections since Mukul Roy joined the party
 kolkata main bhaajapa ne ek alpsankhyak sammelan kiya tha
 There was a large crowd in this conference
 pichley teen maheene main yah bhaajapa doosraa alpsankhyak sammelan tha
 This means that on one hand the alleged secular parties are desperate to do Hindu voters in their favor, on the other hand BJP is considering these voters as its own and in 2019, it will strengthen its constituencies like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal
 i also want to show aakhir, pashchim bengal main aaj tak bhaajapa ne 2 se adhik loksabhaa siten nahin jiti hai
 In Bengal, the Left Front is in a very weak position and if Mamata Banerjee's TMC weakens, the BJP wants to prepare itself as another option to counter that anti-incumbency trend
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa ke daftar main soshal media ke kamare main peeche flax board par laga mishan 148 haalanki vidhansabha ke liye tay kiya target he
 Which may seem far-fetched, but nothing is surprising in politics
 aakhir, 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pashchim bengal main bhaajapa ko mahaj 4
 5 percent votes were received
 lekin loksabhaa main do siton ke saath yah vot share badhkar 16 fisadi ho gaya tha
 In the 2016 Legislative Assembly, then the vote share had increased compared to the previous Assembly, but slightly less than the Lok Sabha
 yah aankadon main badhottaree or vam dalon kii susti bhaajapa ko chusti se gherebandi karne ke liye utsahit kar rahi he
 The BJP had two and a half faces in Bengal
 roopa ganguli, dilip ghosh or rahul sinha
 Babul Supriyo has certainly won elections from Asansol, but his support base is not special in his constituency
