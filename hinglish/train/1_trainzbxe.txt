 Minister Satyendra Jain's difficulties in the Delhi government are increasing
 somvaar ko aay se adhik sampatti ke aarope main sibiai ne jain ke khilaaf patiala house court main chargeshit daayar kii
 The home ministry has allowed the CBI to prosecute the case against Satyendra Jain
 sibiai ne paaya he ki satyendra jain kii sampatti unki aay se 217 fisadi zyada he
 At the same time, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has called the action against his minister a conspiracy
 kejariwal ne kaha, modi ji ne dilli kii kachi coloniyon ko pakkaa karne kii skim banane ke jurm main satyendra jain par ye cese kiya he
 The people living in these colonies will reply to Modi ji this time
 somvaar ko court main sibiai dwaara daayar kii gai chargeshit main aap ke mantri satyendra jain ke alaava unki patni punam jain or kaarobaari sahyogiyon ko bhi aaropee banaaya gaya he
 Among these business associates are Ajit Prasad Jain, Vaibhav Jain, Sunil Jain, and Ayush Jain
 dillisarkaar main swasthya mantri satyendra jain or unki patni punam jain peshey se architect he
 Satyendra Jain along with his wife opened a company called JJ Ideal State Private Limited
 sibiai kii ab tak kii jaanch bataati he ki sachin jain or unki parivaar kaa inna company prayaas info privet limited or mangala yatan project, akinchan developers privet limited jaisi companiyon main bhi hissaa he
 Satyendar Jain was also the director of these three companies, but he resigned as director before contesting elections in 2013, but Satyendra Jain's family's interference in these three companies remained equal
 parivaar ke baaki log in companiyon main share holder bane rahe
 According to the CBI investigation, companies like Prayas Mangalayatan and AK took about Rs 1
5 crore from shell companies in Kolkata
 uske baad satyendra jain or vaibhav jain ne paise ko kolkata ke hawala kaarobaari rajendra bansal ke paas 2016 main bhej diya
 The CBI investigation states that Poonam Jain, the wife of Satyendar Jain, was fully active in all the companies and all the shares in the name of Satyendra Jain were transferred to his wife's name
 sibiai ne apni chargeshit main yah bataane kii koshish kii he ki bhale hi kaagajon main satyendra jain ne in companiyon se istipha de diya ho, lekin apni patni ke jariye in sabhi companiyon par puri tarah se satyendra jain kaa control tha
 The CBI had raided four different places after registering a disproportionate assets case on Satyendra Jain, including the company office of Satyendra Jain's home
 chaape ke dauraan hi yah pataa chalaa tha ki company ke offis adress par koi staff kaam hi nahin karata
 Change is the rule of nature
 
 
 pedo se puraane pattey jharte hai, nae pattey aate hai
 
 
 The old one replaces the new one
 
 
 nayaa purana hota he or phir koi nayaa uski jagah lene aa jaataa he
 
 
 This is the world cycle
 
 
 jivan kaa siddhant he
 
 
 But change is neither easy, nor easy
 
 
 parivartan kii prakriya main pratirodh hota he
 
 
 The old does not leave his place easily, the new cannot easily replace the old
 
 
 is prakriya ko sankraman kaal kah sakate hai
 
 
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is going through this transition period
 
 
 barason se atal-adwani kii chaaya main rahi party ab parivartan ke liye taiyaar he
 
 
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) plan to give the command of the party to the second generation is beginning to take off
 
 
 narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kaa matlab he, party main unka number ek ke pad par pahunchnaa
 
 
 Leaders like Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj have now reached the first position with Modi, but this change has also been opposed, and is still happening
 
 
 aresas kii koshish thi ki loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bujurg netaa maidan khaali karen, taaki nae logon ko haath aazamaane kaa mauka mil sake
 
 
 The Sangh wanted senior leaders of the party to act as guides instead of giving leadership, hence it was proposed that LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi should go to Rajya Sabha instead of Lok Sabha
 
 
 umr main 75 kaa aankada paar kar chuke sabhi netaaon ko yah prastaav diya gaya tha, lekin shaayad sangh kii yah kalpana nahin rahi hogi ki is prastaav kaa itnaa tikhaa virodh hoga
 
 
 86-year-old LK Advani, 80-year-old Murali Manohar Joshi, 79-year-old Shantakumar, 79-year-old Bhuvanchandra Khanduri, 78-year-old Lalji Tandon
 
 
 ye tamaam netaa kham thokkar maidan main bane hue hai
 
 
 But the party's first success in removing elderly leaders from the Lok Sabha elections was achieved in Madhya Pradesh
 
 
 vahaan 84-varshiya kailash joshi ne kaaphi maan-manwwal ke baad party kii is vinati ko maan liya he or saarvajanik rup se elaan kiya he ki vah loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin ladenge
 
 
 In the first list of BJP candidates, Shantakumar's name has been declared from Kangra seat in Himachal Pradesh, while LK Advani has expressed disappointment that his name did not figure in the first list
 
 
 vah saarvajanik rup se kah chuke hai ki vah gandhinagar se hi chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai
 
 
 Similarly, Murali Manohar Joshi is upset with the news going on in the media for the last one year, according to which Narendra Modi can contest his seat from Banaras
 
 
 8 march ko kendriya chunaav samiti kii baithak main unhone party adhyaksh rajnath singh se in khabaron kaa khandan karne ko bhi kaha, magar aresas ke dakhal ke ek din baad unke tevar thande ho gaye or kaha ki party kaa faisla maanenge
 
 
 He has been assured that if Narendra Modi decides to contest from Benares, he will be given a ticket from Kanpur
 
 
 udhar, rajnath singh bhi gajiabad chhodkar lakhanu janaa chaahate hai or isi baat se vahaan ke maujuuda saansad lalji tandon naaraaz ho gaye hai
 
 
 He said that he can leave the seat only for Narendra Modi
 
 
 rajnath singh ke lakhanu se ladane kii sambhaavna ko unhone kaalpanik kahkar khaarij kar diya or kaha he ki unase kisi ne is bare main baat nahin kii he
 
 
 However, he also says that the party will agree to what it decides
 
 
 jabaki tamaam virodh ke baavjood bijepi ne bisi khanduri ko uttarakhand se loksabhaa chunaavon main utaarne kaa man banaaya he
 
 
 When the party decided that the elderly leaders should not contest the Lok Sabha elections, then there was no talk of disrespect towards them
 
 
 balki ise kisi bhi raajnneetik party main badlaav kii swaabhaavik prakriya ke taur par dekha gaya
 
 
 The BJP has been repeatedly saying to focus on young voters in this election, so, of course, younger voters will be more inclined towards new blood than an elderly candidate
 
 
 lekin anubhav ko nazarandaaz karnaa bhi kisi party kii andruni sehat ke liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 
 
 This is what is seen in the BJP in the last one week

 India and China have recently envisaged New India and New China on the lines of the US, drawing out the Indian Dream and Chinese Dream
 china main yah sapana 2013 main tab dekha gaya jab maujuuda raashtrapati shi jinping 2012 main desh kii kaman sambhaal chuke the
 At the same time, in India, 2014 became the turning point for the dream of New India when Narendra Modi formed the government at the Center with absolute majority
 kah sakate hai ki donon hi deshon ne new india or new china kaa sapana samanaantar dekha lekin beete chaar saal ke dauraan is sapane ko hakeekat banane main china ne bharat ko lagbhag 50 saal or peeche chhod diya
 Learn why India has lagged behind China 1
 chinis drimliner (2014):bowing or airbas duniya kii sabhi arthvyavasthaaon ko lambii udaan dene kaa kaam kar rahi he
 The way China has emerged as an economic power at the global level, its dependence on Boeing and Airbus will also remain in the coming days
 lekin 2014 main china sarkaar ne in donon companiyon par nirbharta khatm karne or anya arthvyavasthaaon ko udaane dene ke uddeshy se apana drimliner project shuru kiya jisane 2017 main apni pehali komike si 919 drimliner kii safal udaan bhari
 In terms of technology and effectiveness, comparable to Boeing and Airbus but superior in price, the Dreamliner of China has received supply orders from all over the world before commercial production
 aviation jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agle 50 saal main duniya main sabase zyada bikne vaala drimliner ban saktaa he komike
 At the same time, it may take several decades for India to take initiative in this field because at present it is dependent on other countries for even a helicopter

 Made in China- Industry-4 (2015): For the past few decades China has enjoyed the reputation of being the manufacturing hub of the world
 haalanki is tamge ko vaishvik str par production ke kshetra main nakaaratmak pahalu main zyada dekho jaataa he
 Made in India means cheap and cheap products
 vahiin vaishvik str par utkrisht utpaadan kaa kendra america, germany or japan jaise desh hai jinhen industry-4(chauthaa industrial revolution) kii sangya di gai he
 After assuming command of China, President Xi Jinping has introduced Made in China-2025 to give China an industry-4 status in 2015, under which it will be in excellent production, forgetting the manufacturing hub
 vahiin bharat ne 2015 main mek in india kii shuruyaat kii jiske chalate vah china kii jagah duniya kaa manuphaccharing hub ban sake
 Read this: If India went to war, China would never be able to compensate for these 5 losses
 yuan bana global karency(2016):saal 2016 main yuan ne antarrashtriya mudra kosh kii karency basket main bataur antarrashtriya karency apni jagah bana lee he
 Along with this, the yuan has made itself a global currency with the US dollar, euro, yen and British pound in the international currency field
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle 1999 main euro ko is basket main shaamil kiya gaya tha jiske turant baad china ne apni karency ko global karency banane kii kavayad shuru kar di thi
 Experts in the region believe that even though this feat cannot be said to be a major achievement of China's currency, it is so sure that it has been possible due to the pace of its economic growth for only 35 years
 vahiin is tamge kaa phayda use duniyabar main kaarobaar karne ke liye ab use dollar par nirbhar hone kii jarurat nahin he kyonki uski karency khud dollar ke baraabar antarrashtriya bazaar main khadi he

 At the same time, the rest of the countries of Asia and Europe have to first challenge China in manufacturing to use this network
 gauratlab he ki yadi agle saikadon saal tak vaishvik kaarobaar kii disha tay karne vaale is project se bharat ne khud ko alag kar rakhaa he
 However, China is constantly trying to get India to participate in it, so that the task of connecting OBOR to Indian Ocean can be made easier
 ise padhein: china ke asia bank main shaamil lekin uske paak project kaa virodh?5
 Now China will sell crude oil in Asia (2018): Currently, the sale of crude oil worldwide is done by the Crude Exchange in the US and England

 Now the Chinese government has announced a place in this exclusive club of America and England
 26 march 2018 ko china sarkaar apana crude future contract launch INE karne ja rahi he
 With this, China will get an important role in determining the price of crude being sold in the entire Asia region
 gauratlab he ki beete ek dashak main crude kaarobaar main china ne majboot pakad banaai he or 2017 main usne crude emport main america ko peeche chhod diya he
 Along with that, China also ranks at the top of crude consuming countries
 is kadam ke baad ab china apni mudra main crude oil ko kharid or bech sakegaa or puure asia kshetra main crude kii keemat nirdhaarit karne main use ahm bhoomika mil jaaegi

 com / jxs3vftkul— ANI (@ANI) September 18, 2019 Let us tell you that Union Home Minister Amit Shah, while appealing to promote Hindi language on Hindi Day, said that if any language can do the work of uniting the country, So it is Hindi only
 vaise bharat kai bhashaaon kaa desh he or har bhashaa kaa apana alag mahatv he
 However, it is very important to have a language in the entire country, which can become its identity in the world
 amit shah ne kaha tha ki mahatma gandhi or sardaar vallabhbhai patel ke sapanom ko saakaar karne ke liye pratidin ke kaamon main hindi kaa istemaal badhaane par jor diya janaa chahie
 Since then, this statement of Amit Shah has created a ruckus
 gaiyr hindi bhashaa rajya ke kshetreey dal or unke netaa lagaataar iskaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Karnataka Chief Minister and BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa himself made a statement against the imposition of Hindi language
 iske alaava abhinayta rajnikant, diemke pramukh emke stallin, south superstar or rajaneta camel hasan samet kai vipakshi netaaon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also tweeted about this

 tapati garmi, chaare kii kami or sookhe kaa khatra ab dakshini kerala ke anantpur kshetra main kai deyari kisaanon ko sataane laga he
 Ananthakrishnan Kannappan, who has been living in Anantapur for the last 30 years, believes that this time dairy farmers are selling their animals to avoid the heat
 aisa pehali baar hua he ki pani or chaare ke abhaav ke kaaran kisaanon ko aisa kadam uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 They are forced to sell their animals at low prices
 vahiin, kerala pashu chikitsa, pashu vigyaan vishvavidhyalay or rajya sarkaar ke pashupaalan vibhaag ke shodhakartaaon kii ek team ab vechur or kasargod jaise pashuon ko badhaava de rahi he
 According to the team, species of this type of local varieties have more capacity to dissipate heat and do not get sick too quickly
 pashu prajnan or genetics ke visheshgy iem mohammad kii maane to adhik upaj vaale maveshi umas bhari garmi ke dinon main behosh ho sakate hai yaa phir mar bhi sakate hai, lekin bauni gaay (dworf kau) ek aisi nasl ke pashu hote hai, jinamein garmi bardaast karne kii kshamta adhik hoti he
 The farmers who are rearing Dwarf Cow say that this dwarf-bred cow has very little food and can easily survive even in low water
 visheshgy kii maane to chote paimaane vaale kisaanon ko aise mahaj ek yaa do gaayon kii jarurat he, jo unke pariwaron kii jaruraton ko aasaani se puraa kar saktaa he
 The comments krishi visheshgyon ke anusaar puure kerala main kul 23 lakh maveshi hai, jisamen se 6
 5 per cent 'dwarf' variety includes animals
 lekin, ek mudda zyada kharch kaa he
 Meaning a dwarf breed costs the same as a large breed cow
 jo lagbhag 20,000 rupye kii hoti he
 When large breed cows are healthy and healthy, they give more milk and this is the reason why farmers like big breed cows more
 dworf milk kaaphi mahange hote hai
 Therefore, people whose economic condition is good, they only consume dwarf milk, because it is very nutritious
 yahi nahin, haal hi main gujarat main aise do dworf kerala se laae gaye hai, jabaki punjab ke siem prakaash singh badal ne chandigarh sthit ek farm ke liye aise hi 6 dworf ko mangavaya he
 At the same time, a team of researchers from Kerala Veterinary, Veterinary Sciences University and Animal Husbandry Department of the state government are now promoting animals like Vecchur and Kasaragod
 team kii maane to is prakaar kii sthaneey kismon kii prajatiyon main garmi bardaast karne kii kshamta auron se adhik hoti he or ye jaldi biimaar bhi nahin padate
 Animal breeding and genetics expert EM Mohammed believes high-yielding cattle may faint or even die during humid summer days, but dwarf cows (dwarf cow) are animals of a breed in which heat wastes Ability to do more
 dworf kau ko jo kisaan paal rahe hai unka kahana he ki is bauni nasl vaali gaay kaa aahaar bahut hi kam he or kam pani main bhi ye apana guzaara aasaani se kar lete hai
 According to the expert, small-scale farmers need only one or two cows, which can easily meet the needs of their families
 tippaniyan According to agricultural experts, there are a total of 2
3 million cattle in Kerala, of which 6
 5 pratishat 'dworf' kism ke pashu shaamil hai
 But, one of the issues is over-spending
 matlab ek dworf nasl kii keemat ek bade nasl vaali gaay ke baraabar hoti he
 Which is about 20,000 rupees

 Dwarf milk is very expensive
 isliye jin logon kii aarthik sthiti acchhee he, wo dworf milk kaa hi seven karte hai, kyonki ye kaaphi paushtik hota he
 Not only this, two such dwarfs have recently been brought from Kerala in Gujarat, while Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has ordered 6 such dwarfs for a farm in Chandigarh
 pashu prajnan or genetics ke visheshgy iem mohammad kii maane to adhik upaj vaale maveshi umas bhari garmi ke dinon main behosh ho sakate hai yaa phir mar bhi sakate hai, lekin bauni gaay (dworf kau) ek aisi nasl ke pashu hote hai, jinamein garmi bardaast karne kii kshamta adhik hoti he
 The farmers who are rearing Dwarf Cow say that this dwarf-bred cow has very little food and can easily survive even in low water
 visheshgy kii maane to chote paimaane vaale kisaanon ko aise mahaj ek yaa do gaayon kii jarurat he, jo unke pariwaron kii jaruraton ko aasaani se puraa kar saktaa he
 The comments krishi visheshgyon ke anusaar puure kerala main kul 23 lakh maveshi hai, jisamen se 6
 5 per cent 'dwarf' variety includes animals
 lekin, ek mudda zyada kharch kaa he
 Meaning a dwarf breed costs the same as a large breed cow
 jo lagbhag 20,000 rupye kii hoti he
 When large breed cows are healthy and healthy, they give more milk and this is the reason why farmers like big breed cows more
 dworf milk kaaphi mahange hote hai
 Therefore, people whose economic condition is good, they only consume dwarf milk, because it is very nutritious
 yahi nahin, haal hi main gujarat main aise do dworf kerala se laae gaye hai, jabaki punjab ke siem prakaash singh badal ne chandigarh sthit ek farm ke liye aise hi 6 dworf ko mangavaya he
 According to agricultural experts, there are a total of 2
3 million cattle in Kerala, of which 6
 5 pratishat 'dworf' kism ke pashu shaamil hai
 But, one of the issues is over-spending
 matlab ek dworf nasl kii keemat ek bade nasl vaali gaay ke baraabar hoti he
 Which is about 20,000 rupees

 com / 683i095bjd — BSE India (@bseindia) March 12, 2018 BSE has taken this step to increase the participation of retail investors
 philhal yahaan group e, bi or anya gaiyr vishisht sheyaron par pratibhutiyon ke saundon par shulk lagata he
 This fee ranges from 50 paise to one and a half rupees per deal
 bisai ne isi maheene kii shuruyaat main ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki esendpy bisai sensex 30 ke sheyaron se 12 march se lenden shulk hataaya jayega
 He hoped that this would make BSE the preferred exchange for transactions in Sensex 30 shares
 kharidari ke aadhaar par tay hota he shulkabisai ke sadasyon ko prati maah ek shulk dena hota he
 Transactions up to Rs 1 lakh require a transaction fee of Rs 1
5 per transaction
 iske alaava ek lakh se teen lakh tak ke len-dein par sava rupee prati saude ke hisaab se shulk dena hota he
 At the same time, on a deal of three lakh to 5 lakh rupees, this fee becomes one rupee per deal
 5 lakh se 20 lakh rupee par 75 paise prati sauda lagata he
 If you are doing more than 20 lakh rupees deal, then you have to pay 50 paise per deal
 bataa den ki is saal ke bajet main jetali ne long turm capital gains tex lagaaya he
 Because of this, investors were unhappy
 haalanki bisai ne len-dein shulk khatm kar fori raahat dene kii koshish jarur kii he
 According to the BSE, the transaction fee is charged per trade
 udhaaharan ke liye agar ek niveshak ke maheene ke ant tak total 25 lakh trade hai, to is par use prati trade 0
 a fee of 50 paise is to be paid
 kyonki yah20 lakh rupese zyada he
 In such a situation, when you calculate the transaction fee, it will be 25,00,000 * 0
 5 hoga
 In this way, this fee becomes 12 lakh 50 thousand rupees

 jail se phone par 'live pravachan' dene ko lekar jail prashasan ne asaram ko chetavanee di he ki aage se phone par baat karne kaa adhikaar bhi unase chhina ja saktaa he
 Also, the jail administration has ordered an inquiry on this live discourse case of Asaram which went viral
 jodhpur jail ke ADG bhupendra singh ne kaha ki shuruaati jaanch main hi kuch baaten saamne ai hai
 If Asaram's involvement was found in the matter of giving discourses by addressing the devotees instead of phone conversations, then his right to speak on the phone would be taken away

 It is being said that this audio is after receiving life imprisonment and Asaram is giving discourse directly to his devotees on the phone from inside the jail
 asaram kaa yah live audio pravachan uske fasebuk pej or mobile ap 'mangalamay' par bhi thodi der ke liye share kiya gaya
 But after seeing the uproar, it was lifted shortly after
 is audio main suna ja saktaa he ki asaram kah rahaa he ki vah jald hi jail se baahar aa jayega or nichali adaalat dwaara mili sajaa ko upree adaalat radd kar degi
 Now the kingdom of Asaram, which is handling this woman, is being told that the audio message of Asaram was broadcast on Friday evening

 DIG vikram singh kaa kahana he ki asaram ne phone par baatcheet karne ke dauraan koi aapattijanak baaten nahin kahi hai, jisarke liye jail prashasan us par koi karrwai kare
 Asaram had hatched the entire conspiracy, he told that this conversation of the precautionary prisoners is recorded so that no wrong is spoken
 ho saktaa he ki sabarmati ashram main jab yah baat kar rahaa hoga to iske kol ko record karke prasaarit kar diya gaya hoga
 But the controversy is also arising that the audio message on Asaram's Facebook account was informed even before it was released
 asaram ke fasebuk pej par jari soochna main likhaa hua tha ki '27 april ko jodhpur jail se shaam 6:30 baje asaram kaa audio live hone kii sambhaavna he

 pichley kuch varshon main ali ko kai baar aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 Earlier in early 2015, he had to be hospitalized due to urinary problems
 9 saal 4 maheene or 28 din baad phir ye sawaal poocha ja rahaa he ki aarushi or hemraj ko kisne maaraa? aap sochate rahiye or shaq karte rahiye
 But the truth is that the Aarushi case has been killed by none other than the country's largest investigative agency, the CBI
 kahaniyon ke pulidon par jab jabardastee saboot khadaa karne kii koshish ho to anjaam yahi hota he
 This is what happens when a case is raised by telling the story to the story and the truth to the story
 ab dhundie nau saal baad phir se aarushi or hemraj ke kaatil ko
 The Allahabad High Court gave an important decision on Thursday
 jaj ne bhari adaalat main kaha 'ye adaalat shaq kaa laabh dete hue doctor rajesh talwaar or nupur talwaar ko aarushi or hemraj ke katl ke ilzaam se bari karti he
 'and with this, after nine years, four months and 28 days, this question has once again come in front of the country? After all, who killed Aarushi and Hemraj? Who is the killer of these two? Obviously, we do not even have an answer to this question
 vaise bhi jab desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ke paas hi is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he, to hamaare paas kahaan hoga
 But whatever be the killer of Aarushi, one can say with such a claim that the murderer of the Aarushi case is none other than the CBI, the largest investigative agency in the country
 sibiai ne hi katl kiya he is cese kaa
 The CBI has misled the law
 sibiai ne hi kahani ko hakeekat kaa nakaab pahana kar adaalat ko uljhaayaa he
 Now nine years, four months and 28 days later find Aarushi and Hemraj's killer
 phir banaao koi nai kahani
 Then bring some new theory
 pichley nau saal chaar maheene or 28 din se har maa-baap yahi dua kar rahe the ki jo wo soch rahe hai wo sach naa ho
 Despite knowing the full story of CBI from nine years, five months and ten days, everyone felt that this story is incomplete
 juthi he
 Four years ago, on 25 November 2013, when the CBI Special Court sentenced the Talwar couple to life imprisonment, the decision was still debated
 faisle par ungali bhi uthi
 The decision is incomplete
 kahani puri nahin he
 Links are not joining each other
 vakil, daleel or kahaniyaan to bharpoor hai, magar saboot, chashmadid or theory gaayab thi
 The courts, of course, do not pass judgment on stories
 kahaniyon ke saath kahaniyon ko jodne vaale paatr or saboot bhi hone chahien
 And this was not the case
 bas isiilie elahabaad hai court ne sibiai kii tamaam kahaniyon ko ansuna karte hue nichali adaalat ke faisle ko puri tarah se palat diya
 However, the sayers can still say that the court has released the Talwar couple, giving the benefit of doubt
 to phir is daleel par bhi ye sawaal uthegaa or harek zehan ko jhakzorta rahegaa or wo ye ki kya koi maa-baap apni hi beti kaa katl karne ke baad puure nau saal chaar maheene or 28 din tak apane khooni jurm, apane dohare zajbaat or khokhli bhaawanaaon ko yun chupa sakate hai? agar doctor rajesh tavalaar or noopur talwaar sachmuch apni beti ke kaatil hai to phir yakeenan donon behtareen adaakaar bhi the
 This decision of Allahabad High Court is not surprising
 kyonki sibiai ne apni jaanch main chaunkaane vaali koi cheez dhundhi hi nahin thi
 Allahabad High Court has now acquitted the couple
 jabaki sachai to ye he ki aaropee banane se pehle sibiai khud hi talwaar danpati ko bari kar chuki thi
 In December 2010, the court had even applied to close the case
 wo to adaalat ne fatkaar lagaai to cese band karne vaali arji ko hi aarope patr main badalanaa padaa
 Now, what can be the fate of such a case can be easily guessed by a little understanding of the law
 isliye nau saal chaar maheene or 28 din baad ab ye sawaal phir se sir uthayega ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj ko kisne maar? sibiai ke dhurandhar afasar arun kumaar or unki team kya is sawaal kaa jawaab dena chaahegi? aaj desh yahi jaananaa chahta he

 dilli main construction mazdooron ke haq ke saikadon karod rupe gadabadi kar hadpe jane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 No one else to bring this to the fore are the officers of the Delhi Government Labor Department, who have been engaged in the work of verification of the workers engaged in construction work
 haalanki is gadabadjhaale ko lekar kai baar sarkaar kaa dhyaan dilaayaa gaya, lekin jab gadabadi par koi karrwai nahin hui, to saare afasaron ne kaam karne se manaa kar diya
 Reached Secretary of Labor Department of Delhi Government
 bataa den ki narazfasaronmen joint lebar kamishnar, edisnal lebar kamishnar, investigation afasar rank ke afasar shaamil the
 All officers met Labor Secretary Sanjay Kumar Saxena and informed him about the disturbances in the Construction Welfare Fund
 saath hi in afasaron ne kaha he ki gadabadiyon ke chalate wo ab nae mazdooron kaa registration or navinikaran kaa kaam nahi karenge
 According to sources, in the complaint made by the officers, it has been said that during the last three years, more than 50 unions of construction workers have been formed in Delhi
 dilli building and adar construction board ke niyamon ke mutabik union ko manyata die jane ke niyam behad saamaanya he or inkaa phayda uthaakar kai farji unionon ne bhi maanyata hasil kar lee he
 Unions have the right to recommend and verify the registration of new construction workers
 aise main hazaron kii sankhya main aise mazdooron ko in unionon ne mazdooron ke taur par panjiyan kara diya, jo darasal majuduri karte hi nahin hai
 By doing this, crores of rupees are being spent in the name of subsidies to the workers from the Construction Welfare Fund
 sutron ke mutabik raajnneetik dabaav ke jariye afasaron se bhi farji mazdooron ko register karaayaa ja rahaa he
 This benefit from the Construction Workers Welfare Fund is that if a building is constructed or construction work is done anywhere in the building, then the contractor has to deposit a certain amount in the Construction Workers Welfare Fund
 is fund main dilli me kareeb do hazaar karod kii rakam jamaa he
 Out of this amount is spent for the welfare and help of registered laborers
 masalan majdoor kii beemaari se lekar accident yaa bacchon kii padhai likhaai aadi ke liye rakam mazdooron ko di jaati he
 There is a provision for scholarships ranging from five hundred rupees a month to five thousand rupees a month for the children of laborers from school to higher education
 majdoor kii beti kii shaadi ke liye 51 hazaar or bete kii shaadi ke liye 35 hazaar rupye die jate hai
 Besides, a registered laborer is given a pension of three thousand rupees a month after the age of sixty
 inhi sahuliyaton ko lene ke liye raajnneetik sangrakshan praapt logon ne farji union banaakar apane kaaryakartaaon ko majdoor ke taur par register kara diya he
 Based on that, government assistance is being taken unfairly
 lebar department ke ek afasar ne naam ujagar na karne kii shart par bataaya ki vibhaag ne is maamle ko lekar teen exiaar bhi darj karaayi hai or afasaron ko gadabadi kii puri jaankaree di he
 According to the officer, this fraud is going on so vigorously that the offices of the union have opened in the homes of political people and millions of rupees are being collected by fake registrations
 lebar kamishnar sanjay saxena ne is bare main kuch bhi bolne se inkaar kar diya
 The Delhi BJP attacked the Kejriwal government over the entire matter
 adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ne mazdooron kaa haq markar apane kaaryakartaaon ko majdoor ke taur par register karaayaa he or unhen aarthik laabh pahunchaaya he
 Tiwari said that crores of rupees have been manipulated in this fraud

 a former Laden bodyguard has claimed that Osama was not killed in the operation of the American Navy Seal, but that he blew himself up with suicide belts
 gauratlab he ki america ne daawa kiya tha navy sil ne 2 may 2011 ko 'oparation jeronimo' ke tahat pakistan ke abtabad main osama-bin-laden ke ghar main ghuskar use maar giraaya tha
 Refuting the US claims, Laden's former bodyguard Nabil Abdul Fateh has revealed that as soon as the American Navy seal entered Osama's house in Abbottabad, Laden blew himself with his belt
 fateh ne bataaya ki jis vakt osama kii maut hui, us vakt vah vahaan maujuud nahin tha, lekin osama ke ek kareebi rishtedaar ne yah baat bataai
 Opponents of Osama point out that his supporters deliberately spread such propaganda and there is no truth in the former bodyguard's claim
 abdul fateh kaa kahana he ki america raashtrapati kaa yah daawa ekadam galat he ki laden ko samudr kii gaharaaiyon main dafnaaya gaya he
 He said, "laden's body was cut into pieces due to the bombings
" yah aatmghaatee hamale kii hi tarah tha jisamen marane vaale shaks kii pahchaan karnaa behad mushkil ho jaataa he
 Fateh said that Laden had blown himself because he did not want to fall under the clutches of the US Army and did not want to reveal his secrets until his death
 abdul fateh ne daawa kiya laden pichley 10 saalon se bamon se las belt pahentaa tha
 How much truth is there on Abdul's claims is also under suspicion

 ’magra ne kaha ki is tarah ke muqablon main gendbaaj visheshkar tej gendbaaj phaayde main rahenge
 He said, "pink ball will definitely be of little benefit
 wicket par thodi ghaas adhik hogi
 Its color will come off very fast and its grip will not be like the old ball, especially in case of test ball
 isse gendbaajon ko thodaa phayda milegaa
 This will give them a little swing

 ' england ke wales main ek aise khatarnaak repist kaa khulaasa hua he, jisaki harakatein sun kisi bhi ruh kaanp uthe
 The court sentenced the rapist to 10 years and warned him never to contact the victim after completing the sentence
 peedita ke bayaan ke mutabik, yah repist itnaa khatarnaak tha ki rape ke dauraan vah daanton se peedita ke gale kii nas katkar baahar nikaal dena chahta tha
 Actually, this dangerous rapist has done such incidents earlier also
 use 2006 main 18 varshiya ladki ko eent se markar buree tarah ghayal karne ke aparaadh main bhi sajaa ho chuki he
 The victim was suffering from this dreaded criminal for four years
 2013 main bhi vah peedita kaa rape kar chukaa he
 But then the victim thought it appropriate to keep quiet
 lekin is baar jab usne peedita kaa rape kiya to barbarta kii sari hadein paar kar deen
 During the rape, he also tried to strangle the victim through a chain worn around the victim's neck
 yahaan tak ki usne ek anguthi peedita ke gale ke andar daalkar uski saansen rokane kii bhi koshish kii
 However, the victim somehow rescued herself by attacking her face and lodged a complaint against him in the police
 peedita ke andar repist kaa khauf is kadar haaavee thi ki vah sunwaayee ke dauran bhi use nahin dekhnaa chaahati thi
 The victim told that after the last incident she could not get out of the house for seven months
 court ne jab peedita ko muaavje kii peshkash kii to usne thukaraate hue kaha ki agar main ise sweekaar karti hum tokhud ko vaishya mahasoos karuungi
 During the trial, the victim even called the rapist as 'the devil' and said that she wanted the culprit to die in jail
 peedita ne kaha ki main uski hatya nahin karnaa chaahati or na hi yah chaahati hum ki koi doosraa uski hatya kar de, lekin main use jail ke baahar jinda nahin dekhnaa chaahati
 The court sentenced the offender to 10 years in prison
 jail se baahar aane ke baad us par peedita se sampark karne se pratibandh lagaaya gaya he
 He has also been asked to sign the Sex Offender Register even after coming out of jail
 peedita ne haalanki 10 saal kii sajaa die jane par hataasha vyakt kii
 The victim said she expected the offender to be sentenced to a minimum of 17 years in prison, as he is a devil and a threat to public life

 Even after the efforts of Safdarjung's doctors, his life was not saved
 hamaare liye yah kaala diwas he
 We could not give justice to a daughter who was seeking justice
 unhone aage kaha ki uttar pradesh kii maujuuda sarkaar ke raaj main yah pehali ghatana nahin he
 One daughter of Unnao lost the entire family
 koun doshi tha, bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar doshi thi
 If this daughter is killed, then if any of her is guilty then she is the government

 Someone is writing a phone number with their helplessness, while someone is trying to placate by writing 'I love you' or love letter

When LG felt that Chikungunya and Daegu had wreaked havoc in Delhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as well as Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia were also absent
 isi par alji ne fax bhejkar unhen waapas aane ko kaha to kejariwal sarkaar ke do mantri alji sachivalay par drama karne pahunch gaye
 The BJP called the Kejriwal government a gimmick
 tandon cameti kii report ko tehraaya sahito vahiin bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar ke vigyaapan niti par sawaal uthaate huetandan cametiki report ko sahi tehraaya
 The BJP made it clear that the AAP government spent crores on advertisements not only in Delhi but also in states like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Punjab with public money just to enhance the image of the party

 The 'pakistan State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act' has been introduced by Poe of the Republican Party and Congress member Dana Rohrabacher from the Democratic Party
 rohrabachar aatankwaad par congress kii prabhaavshaalee samiti ke ranking sadsy hai
 Po said, Pakistan is not only a trustworthy ally, but it has also helped and encouraged America's enemies over the years

 Poe said President Barack Obama would have to issue a report within 90 days of the passage of the bill to tell whether Pakistan had provided support to international terrorism

 Meanwhile, another Congress member Pete Olson said, "I strongly condemn the terrorist attack on the Indian military base in Kashmir, in which 18 Indian soldiers lost their lives
" bharat shanti main majboot saajhedaar evam sahyogi he
 "I support every effort to find the perpetrators of this abominable act so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice," Olson said

 The Commission had said that the elections in Gujarat would be held before December 18

 inke mutabik 2015 main kejariwal ne inaki maangon kii vijyapti par hastakshar karte hue inhen pakki naukari kaa bhi aashwaasan diya tha
 Therefore, the purpose of this dharna demonstration is the demand to strengthen the Anganwadi employees

 With all these demands, thousands of employees and helpers are sitting on indefinite strike outside the Chief Minister's residence, closing 22 thousand Anganwadis in Delhi

 This is the story of that desperate half of the population of the society who are holding their desires
 jo apane man kii bechaini ke chalate khud ko katghare main khadaa karti hai
 They ask themselves questions whether their life is directionless
 un mahilaon ko dar he ki vah paagalpan kaa shikaar na ho jaaen

 New trouble arose for former Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran when the Madras High Court on Monday canceled his interim anticipatory bail in the alleged illegal telephone exchange case and directed him to surrender to the CBI within three days
 justise es vaidyanathan ne sibiai ke samaksh aatmasamarpan karne ke liye maaran ko teen din kii mohalat dete hue kaha, 'antarim agrim jamaanat raddki jaati he
 The judge gave this order after hearing the pleas of Maran's plea seeking cancellation of interim anticipatory bail and the plea of maran seeking stay of interim bail
 sibiai ne maaran or anya ke khilaaf ek exiaar darj kii he
 It alleged that more than 300 high speed telephone lines were connected to his residence and it was given to his brother Kalanidhi Maran's Sun TV channel to enable its uplinking

 Fearing arrest in the case, Maran approached the court and Justice r Subbiah on June 30 granted him a six-week advance bail with the condition that he appear before the CBI on July 1 and cooperate in the investigation
 sibiai ne baad main is aadhaar par agrim jamaanat ko radd karne kii maang ko lekar hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya ki vah jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 During the arguments in the previous hearing, Maran had claimed that the CBI is seeking cancellation of his bail to tarnish his image
 maaran ke vakil pies raman ne daawa kiya tha ki aaropon ko sabit karne ke liye ab tak koi saboot pesh nahin kiya gaya he or aashcharya jataayaa ki kaise beasenel kii telephone linon kaa istemaal video kaa prasaaran karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 He had said, 'how can you broadcast cinema through telephone lines
 ' raman ne daawa kiya ki maaran kii chhavi ko dhoomil karne kii manshaa se sibiai aarope laga rahi he ki unhone jaanch main sahyog nahin kiya
 That too after the security permission of Sun Group was rejected by the Ministry of Home Affairs
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kathith dhokhadhadi sibiai ke anusaar 2011 main hui lekin exiaar 2013 main darj kii gai
 Additional Solicitor General G
 Rajagopalan, however, said that the custodial interrogation of Maran was important to find out who was the real beneficiary of the fraud and how much damage it caused to the exchequer

 In an era when every big Bollywood star is present on platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, Kareena has officially kept distance from them but it is not that Kareena does not come under the trolls' target

 Citing the latest data released by the Reserve Bank of India, the Congress has termed demonetisation as a big scam of the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki notebandi kaa iraadaa desh ke bade udyogpatiyon ke kaale dhan ko safed karnaa tha
 So demonetisation was not a mistake, demonetisation was deliberately aimed at opening the way for big business houses
