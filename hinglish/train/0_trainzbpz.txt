 com / bharat main upabhoktaaon ko ab jaldi hi badi takat milane vaali he
 On Wednesday evening, the cabinet approved the new Consumer Protection Bill
 is bill main upabhoktaaon kii shikayaton ke niptaare ke liye or saath hi saath bhraamak prachaar se nipatane ke liye kade upaay kiye gaye hai
 New Consumer Protection Bill was hanged in Parliament for a long time and it was introduced in the Lok Sabha by the Central Government in August 2015 itself
 uske baad yah bill standinguametike paas chalaa gaya tha
 The Standing Committee submitted its report only in April last year
 lekin standing cameti ne apni report main bill main itane saare parivartan karne kii salaah de daali thi ki mantralay ne nae sire se bill laana hi behatar samajha
 The new bill has been approved in the cabinet on the attention of consumers
 isliye sarkaar ab 2015 main loksabhaa main pesh kiye gaye bill ko waapas lekar isi satr main uski jagah yah nayaa bill pesh karegi
 The new bill provides that consumers do not have to push around for redressal of their grievances
 is bill main central consumar protection ourity banane kaa praavdhaan he jo upabhoktaaon ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye kaam karegi
 The consumer protection bill also provides for dealing with misleading publicity and action is also provided against those who will make false claims about something without seeing it
 nae kanjumar protection bill main online kharidari ke maamle main graahakon ke saath dhokhadhadi or kharid se judi shikayaton ke niptaare ke liye bhi behatar intjaam kiye gaye hai
 Trying to get the bill passed in the winter session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in a conference recently that the government's priority is to bring a new law to protect the interests of consumers
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar isi sheetakaaleen satr main is bill ko paas kara kar ise kanoonee rup dene kii koshish karegi
 According to the Hindu Panchang, Dhanteras (dhanteras) is celebrated on the 13th day of the month of Kartik
 dhanteras se hi diwaali (diwali) parv kii shuruyaat hoti he
 This day means that Dhanteras also has the ritual of worshiping Lord Dhanwantri (dhanvantri) as well as Maa Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth
 manyata he ki dhanteras ke din lakshmi pujan (lakshmi Puja) se daridrata dur hoti he or ghar dhan-dhaany se paripurna ho jaataa he
 On the day of Dhanteras, shopping of Shakti Deepawali is done and it is considered auspicious to bring an image of lakshmi-ganesh with this item
 manyata he ki dhanteras ke din sirf lakshmi-ganesh kii pratimaa nahin lani chahie, balki uske saath mithai bhi honi chahie
 You should also buy kheel-batashe as well
 lakshmi ji se rahaa na gaya or jaise hi bhagwaan aage bade lakshmi bhi peeche-peeche chal padin
 After going a little further, he saw a mustard field which had lots of flowers
 sarson kii shobhaa dekhakar vah mantrmugdh ho gayi or phool todakar apana shringaar karne ke baad aage badhin
 On going further, Lakshmi broke sugarcane from a sugarcane field and started sucking juice
 usee kshan vishnu ji aae or yah dekh lakshmi ji par naaraaz hokar unhen shaap dete hue bole, 'maine tumhen idhar aane ko manaa kiya tha, par tum na maani or kisaan ke khet main chori kaa aparaadh kar baithi
 Now you should serve this farmer for 12 years in the crime of this crime
 ' aisa kahkar bhagwaan unhen chhodkar kshirsagar chale gaye
 Then Lakshmi started living in the house of that poor farmer
 ek din lakshmi ne us kisaan kii patni se kaha, 'tum snaan kar pehle meri banaai gai is devi lakshmi kaa pujan karo, phir rasoi bananaa, tab tum jo maangogi milegaa
 'farmer's wife did the same
 puja ke prabhaav or lakshmi kii krupa se kisaan kaa ghar duusare hi din se ann, dhan, ratna, swarna aadi se bhar gaya
 Lakshmi completed the farmer with money
 kisaan ke 12 varsh bade anand se cat gaye
 Then after 12 years Laxmiji agreed to go
 vishnuji lakshmi ko lene aae to kisaan ne unhen bhejne se inkaar kar diya
 Then God told the farmer, 'who lets them go, they are fickle, they don't stay anywhere
 inako bade-bade nahin roak sake
 He was cursed by me so was serving you for 12 years
 tumhaari 12 varsh seva kaa samay puraa ho chukaa he
 'the farmer obstinately said,' No! Now i will not let Lakshmi ji go
 'tab lakshmi ne kaha, 'he kisaan! tum mujhe rokna chaahate ho to jo main kahuun vaisaa karo
 Tomorrow is thirteen
 tum kal ghar ko lip-potkar svachh karnaa
 Keep a lamp of ghee in the night and worship me in the evening and keep a copper vase filled with money for me, i will reside in that urn
 kintu puja ke samay main tumhen dikhaai nahin duungi
 'lakshmi Ji further said,' i will not leave your house for a year with this one day worship
 ' yah kahkar vah dipakon ke prakaash ke saath dason dishaao main fail gayi
 The next day the farmer worshiped according to the dictates of Laxmiji
 uskaa ghar dhan-dhaany se purna ho gaya
 Since then, Lakshmiji was worshiped every year on Teres day

 dilli kii satta, to haathon main aa gai, lekin ek raajnneetik party ke taur par 'aap' ke kaamkaaj ko lekar tarah-tarah ke andeshe or chintaaen saamne aane lagi hai
 a large list of questions has also been issued by the Lokpal of the party, Admiral Ramadoss
 prashanth bhushan ravivaar to bich baithak se hi baahar nikal aae or baithak ko anaupchaarik bhi bataa diya lekin khabar yahi he ki jin netaaon ko lekar party main khalabali machi he unamem ek prashanth bhushan or duusare party ke buddhijivi chehre yogendra yadav hai
 At the moment, the fact of the furore in the Aam Aadmi Party is that the membership of the PSC of both Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan has started to knock down most of the members
 26 farvari ko rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main yogendra yadav kii maujuudagi main hi un par tikhe sawaal uthe
 After the formation of the government, most of the leaders of the party have started losing many of Yogendra Yadav's past
 in netaaon kaa aarope he ki yogendra yadav ne haryana ikai ko pareshaan kiya
 Secondly, false reports were made against Kejriwal and the third was that he threatened Kejriwal before the Delhi elections
 chauthaa, party chhodane kii dhamkee dekar apni sharten manavaate rahe or paanchvaan yah ki party kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala giraane kaa kaam karte rahe
 These are just allegations, it is difficult to decide how true and how concrete they are, but as far as the change in PAC is concerned, the party leaders are giving different opinions in front of the camera on this
 haalanki naaraazgi sirf yogendra yadav yaa prashanth bhushan ko lekar hi nahin he
 The party's Lokpal Admiral Ramdas has also questioned Kejriwal's supremacy over the party
 gauratlab he ki dilli main aitihaasik jeet ke baad arvind kejariwal ne aisa bayaan de diya tha ki party ke kai netaa sakate main aa gaye
 One of those leaders is also Yogendra Yadav as he was also a supporter of the ambitious plan to take out a newly-fledged party from Delhi
 ab yogendra yadav party ke bheetar nishane par hai, to sawaal ye bhi uth rahaa he ki khud arvind kejariwal kya chaahate hai
 The question does not arise only on Yogendra Yadavaya Prashant Bhushan
 sawaalon kii jad main puri party he, kaamkaaj kaa uskaa taur-tarika he
 Admiral Ramadoss, a member of the party's Lokpal, has shown Kejriwal a mirror by writing a long letter
 admiral ramdaas ne chand gambhir or khalabali machaane vaale sawaal uchhaale hai
 The questions that Ramdas posed are -1
 party kaa rashtriya sanyojak kyon nahin?2
 Why not be made a co-convener in the party? 3
 party main aantarik loktantr kyon nahin?4
 Why are workers being ignored? 5
 mantrimandal main ek bhi mahila kyon nahin?6
 Why an atmosphere of mistrust within the party? 7
 piesi-kaaryakarini kaa punargathan kyon nahin?aam aadmi party ke andarkhaane asantosh, to lambey arase se tha lekin ramdos kii chitthee saarvajanik hote hi andruni hakeekat bhi saamne aa gai he
 Concerns have started appearing clearly on the big faces of the Aam Aadmi Party
 vaise khabar ye bhi he ki khud kejariwal ne sanyojak pad kii jimmedaari se mukti maangi he
 It is said that he wants to apply full strength and full experience on the role of the Chief Minister
 lekin party taiyaar nahin
 Because this is true, everyone knows that Aam Aadmi Party means only and only Kejriwal

 ’ Women are generally known to do more makeup, but the truth is that Naga sadhus adorn more than women
 mahakumbh ke pehle shahi snaan ke dauraan naga saadhuon ke ye shringaar vaaki main mahilaon ko bhi maat dete najar aae
 During the first royal bath, various forms of Naga Sadhus of different akharas were seen
 june akhaade se jude naga sant shravan ne batichat ke dauraan kaha, "ham to mahilaon se bhi adhik shringaar karte hai
 Women make up only sixteen, we make up 17
 " There are also different types of Naga Sadhus in the akharas
 kuch naram dil to kuch akkhad swabhaav ke hote hai

 baatcheet ke dauraan naga sant ne kaha ki shahi snaan se pehle naga sadhu puri tarah saj-dhaj kar taiyaar hote hai or phir apane isht kii prarthana karte hai
 When asked about the seventeen makeup of the Nagas, he told that the nappy, bhabhut, sandalwood, iron or silver bracelet on the feet, ring, panchkesh, flower garland in the waist, roll coating on the forehead, coil, tongs in the hands, Damru or Kamandal, Gutta Jata and Tilak, Kajal, Kadha in the hands, Vibhuti paste in the body and Rudraksha Mala on the arms, are included in 17 Shringar
 naga sant bataate hai ki log nity kriya karne ke baad khud ko shuddh karne ke liye ganga snaan karte hai, lekin naga sanyasi shuddhikaran ke baad hi shahi snaan ke liye nikalate hai
 a specialty of Naga ascetics who reached Mahakumbh is that their mind is as clean as children
 ye apane akhaadon main hameshaa dhama-chaukadi machaate rahete hai
 His monastery keeps resonating with his eighties

 In Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh, an elderly woman was attacked and brutally murdered by a silbatte
 mritak mahila peshey se adhyaaapak thi or agle din hi vah seva se ritair hone vaali thi
 This case of murder is of Gola Gokarnanath of Lakhimpur
 jahaan bhagirathi namakabujurgmahila apane ghar ke andar akeli so rahi thi
 Meanwhile, he was brutally murdered after hitting Silbatta
 mahila ek sarkari skool main adhyapika thi
 On Wednesday afternoon, his body was found stained with blood in the house
 police ke mutabik bhagirathi kal yani 31 march ko ritair hone vaali thim
 According to the police, Bhagirathi, the headmaster of the primary school in Gola town, lived in Patel Nagar locality
 mangalvaar kii raat vah ghar par akeli thim
 The younger son Anuj, who lived with him, had gone to his in-laws in the evening
 buudhvaar kii dopaher tak bhagirathi ke ghar kaa darwaja nahin khulaa
 People nearby feared something untoward
 darasal, unke ghar kaa darwaja baahar se band tha
 No one had seen Bhagirathi going out of the house
 isi dauraan bhagirathi kaa bada betaa vinod bhi maukey par pahunch gaya
 When Vinod broke the door lock, he started making noise as soon as he entered the house
 ghar ke andar bhagirathi kii khun se sanilashapadi thi
 There was a stone stained with blood of silbatte nearby
 soochna milane par police bhi maukey par pahunch gai
 Police took the corpse and sent it for postmortem
 police ko shaq he ki hatya main bhagirathi ke kisi kareebi kaa haath ho saktaa he
 Police is also questioning his son Vinod
 aapkaa aane waal kal kaisaa hoga ye koi nahin bataa saktaa
 Maybe you are on top today, but tomorrow you are on the ground
 aisa hi kuch adivasee kisaan daitari nayak (daitari Nayak) ke saath hua he
 Remind you 75-year-old Daitari, a resident of mineral-rich Talbaitarni village in Keonjhar district of Odisha, is the man who single-handedly dug up a three-kilometer-long canal of Gonasika for irrigation between 2010 and 2013
 is nahar se ab 100 acre jameen kii sinchai hoti he
 He was awarded the Padma Shri this year for his work
 haalanki aword jeetna unki jindagi ke kisi kaam nahin aayaa balki unki haalat or kharaab ho gai
 According to the Hindustan Times, Nayak has no work because people feel that such a big award has made him a big man
 ab kisaan kii mali haalat itani kharaab ho gai he ki unka parivaar jinda rahane ke liye cheentee ke andey khaane ko majaboor he
 Talking about his situation, Daitari Nayak said, "the Padma Shri award did not help Merad in any way
 pehle main dihadi mazdooree karata tha
 Now people are not giving me any work because they feel that it is against my honor
 ab ham cheentee ke andey khaakar guzaara kar rahe hai
 "the heroes selling Tendu leaves and mango papad for money now want to return their award because it is no longer important to them
 unke mutabik, "ab main apana ghar chalaane ke liye tendu patta or aam papad bech rahaa hum
 For me, the award has lost its importance
 main aword waapas lautaanaa chahta hum taaki mujhe koi kaam mil sake
 "he was given a house of Indira Awas Yojana under the Biju Pakka Ghar Scheme of the state government a few years ago, but that too proved to be completely false
 parinamswaroop nayak abhi bhi apane puraane ghar main hi rah rahe hai
 He gets an old age pension of Rs 700
 apane pita ko kiye gaye duusare vaadon ke bare main baat karte hue unke bete aalekh kehete hai, "adhikariyon ne hamase vaada kiya tha ki patharilii nahar ko kancreet kaa banaaya jayega
 My father is also disappointed that he is not able to provide clean drinking water to the people
 "halaat se dukhi nayak ne apane aword ko bakrii ke gale main taang diya he
 Keonjhar district collector Ashish Thackeray says that he will listen to Nayak's complaint and convince him not to return the award
 ummid he ki jald hi daitari nayak kii shikayaton kaa niptaan hoga or phir se unki kismat chamak uthegi
 The arrested militants of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) created chaos in the Bhopal court premises when they shouted slogans against the country's future Prime Minister Narendra Modi amidst tight security arrangements by the police
 aatankiyon ne kaha ki ab kii baar modi kaa number he
 The incident took place on Saturday when the police were taking these banned SIMI activists towards a vehicle parked in the jail premises after presenting them in court
 police sutron ne ravivaar ko yahaan bataaya, 'pratibandhit simi ke vibhinn maamalon main giraftaar lagbhag 15 aatankiyon ko police kadi suraksha vyavastha ke bich adaalat main laai thi
 When the police were bringing these terrorists back to the prison vehicle after presenting them in the court, then the terrorist Abu Faizal who was absconding from Khandwa jail started shouting slogans against Modi
 jaise hi abu ne narebaaji kii, iske baad sabhi simi aatankiyon ne narebaaji shuru kar di
 The terrorists shouted slogans threatening the Chief Minister of Gujarat and the future Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi, saying that this time is Modi's number
 unhone bataaya ki iske alaava in simi aatankiyon ne yah bhi naare lagaae ki duniya kii ek hi takat allaah he, taliban aayega or narendra modi jayega or abaki baar modi kii baari he
 Later, the police took him back to a Central Jail in Bhopal in a prison vehicle
 atirikt police mahanideshak (khufia) sarbajit singh ne aaj bataaya ki is maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue police ne ipisi kii dhara 153 di or 295 e ke tahat shahar ke maharana pratap nagar police thane main maamla darj kar liya he
 Singh said, 'they were only attracting the attention of the people by raising these slogans
 hamane is maamle ko gambhirtha se liya he or bhavishya main jab bhi inhen adaalat main pesh kiya jayega, ham suraksha vyavastha ko or badha denge
 He told that the jail authorities will request the court to ensure their future appearance in the court through video conferencing, so that such situation can be avoided
 unhone kaha ki ye sabhi kattar apradhi hai
 The Simi terrorists who were produced in the court included Abu Faizal, who was absconding from Khandwa jail, who was later arrested from a hill near Barwani, Akil Khilji, Rakib, Sadiq Habib, Israr, Khalid Ahmed, Irfan Nagauri, Abdul Aziz , Abdul Wahid, Mohammad Khalid Saeed alias Guddu, Abdul Majid and Jubera
 in sabhi ko mukhya nyaayik magistrate pankaj singh maheshwari kii adaalat main madhya pradesh main simi network failaane or indian mujahidin (iem) ke saath sambandh rakhane ke maamle main pesh kiya gaya tha
 All of them are accused of many serious crimes

 Passengers sitting on a flight of British Airways were shocked when the entire plane was filled with smoke
 landan se spain ja rahi is flite kii emergency landig kerani padi
 During landing at the airport in Valencia, Spain, 'britesh Airways' aircraft suddenly saw smoke
 sabhi yatriyon ko surakshit nikaal liya gaya
 News agency 'europa Press' reported that the local authorities had informed that three people got sick from asphyxiation, which is undergoing treatment
 vahiin, 10 se 12 logon ko apaat daravaaje se nikalate samay chote ain
 The pilot does this with the plane to make a landing, people are stuck in breath, see the emergency services of the regional government of Valencia, VIDEO said that they were informed about the fire in the aircraft engine, but the rescuers only at the airport Smoke only showed
 # britishairways # Valencia # emergencylanding Still waiting to hear what actually happened on our British Airways flight from LHR to Valencia in which our cabin filled with smoke in the last 10 minutes of flight, had to disembark via emergency chutes
 No comms 60 mins and counting! pic
 twitter
 com / uywuesxhec Passenger Rachel Zapp, who was on the flight, said that the smoke was so much that we did not see the person sitting on the front seat
 vahiin ek or yatri ke ne kaha ki ye vakya kisi horer film jaisaa hi tha
 a 5-floor building seen flowing in the river, the people watching the VIDEO were blown away, said - how is this possible? There were 175 customers, 6 cabin crew and two pilots in this plane
 airline ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, "ham heathrow se valencia jane vaale ‘british airways' ke vimaan ‘bie422' ke ghatana kii pushti karte hai
 "pakistani reporter drowned in water till neck, this is how the flood situation, video went viral gurugram main trephic niyam todane vaale vaahan chaalkon ko jaagruk karne ke liye gurugram trephic police or road sefti officer organijeshan ne anoothaa tarika nikaala he
 Now two characters of the Sholay film Gabbar and Sambha will tell the rule-breaking vehicle drivers from their well-known dialogues that by doing so, they are risking their lives
 gabbar ke sawaalon par sambha jawaab degaa ki is niyam ko todane ke kya-kya nuksaan hai
 Gabbar and Sambha Sholay, which appear on the streets of Gurugram, are definitely the characters of the film, but they are not playing the role of any film but are making them aware of the traffic rules breakers
 darasal gurugram ke huda city centre metro stesan ke baahar jed chowk par gurugram trephic police or road sefti orgenigeshan ne milakar jaagrukta kaa yah nayaa tarika nikaala he
 In this, Gabbar Sholay asks Sambha in the same style as the film, Oh o Sambha, to tell us that without the helmet or without the belt, there is an advantage or disadvantage
 tab sambha kahata ki sardaar isse to nuksaan hi nuksaan he
 Gabbar will ask what are the disadvantages
 tab sambha kahegaa bina helmet sir main gambhir chot lag sakati he
 One can die even after going into a coma
 helmet yadi pahane to kya phaayde honge? tab sambha kahegaa ki helmet pahanane se haadase main sir main chot lagane ke chance behad kam ho jaaenge
 This will save lives and the family will not have to face much sorrow and trouble
 vahiin is abhiyaan kaa hissaa bane trephic police ke aalaa adhikariyon kii maane to is drive kaa makasad logon ko trephic ke niyamon ke prati jaagruk karne ke saath logon kii jaan bachaana bhi he
 This is indeed a commendable step by the Gurugram traffic police, but how much those who defy traffic rules follow it will only tell the time to come

 The supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party were aware that there may be an attack with ink or shoes, so instead of inviting Satyendra Jain, they try to leave by sitting in Sanjay Singh's Scorpio
 is bich bhaavana arora kar kii taraf daudti hai or mantri kii taraf juuta phenkakar maarthi hai lekin ye juuta car ke shishe par jaakar takaraa jaataa he
 Bhavna Arora has also gone to jail for throwing ink on CM Arvind Kejriwal

 That is why today, he would also blacken his face, leaving the border after hitting his shoes
 "juuta oochhaalane yaa syaahi phenkane ke alaava virodh karne ke kai or tareeke bhi ho sakate hai

 France has intensified reconnaissance operations in Syria's Raqqa city since Sunday night after the attack in Paris on Friday
 paris hamale ke baad france ke raashtrapati francwa oland ne duniyabar ke deshon se aatankwaad ke khilaaf ekasaath aage aane kii apil kii he
 The Paris attack killed 129 people, while more than 300 people were injured
 chhattisgarh main paanch saal baad bhi jheram ghati hatyakand kii hakeekat saamne nahin aane par rajya kii congress sarkaar ne kadaa etraj jaahir kiya he
 The Government of Chhattisgarh is awaiting the full report of the NIA in this matter
 iske liye sarkaar ne NIA ko patr likhakar ghatana kaa puraa byoraa or cese kii vaapasi karne kii maang kii he, taaki SIT jaanch jald shuru ho sake
 Let us tell you that on 25 May 2013, Naxalites in the Jheeram Valley of Bastar killed 35 leaders and activists in a swift attack on the Congress' Parivartan Yatra
 is hamale main congress ke tatkaaleen pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar patel, purv kendriya mantri vidyacharan shukla, purv mantri mahendra karma, purv vidhayak udai mudaliyaar ko naksaliyon ne apana nishaanaa banaaya tha
 SIT will conduct an investigation, three days after the incident, the then BJP government of the state formed a judicial commission
 lekin paanch saal baad bhi report nahin aane par congress sarkaar ne ise rajnatik shadyantr qaraar dete hue puri ghatana kii SIT se jaanch karaane kaa faisla kiya
 Detailed investigation report of NIA is awaited in Ministry of Government of Chhattisgarh
 rajya kicongresssarkaar ne NIA ko patr likhakar jheram cond kaa puraa byoraa maanga he
 The investigation of the Jhiram Valley attack that took place five years ago in Chhattisgarh will now be conducted by the Special Investigation Team
 yah jaanch shuru ho isse pehle NIA se ab tak hui jaanch kaa nishkarsh or final report ke alaava cese vaapasi kii maang kii gai he
 The Director General of Police of the state has written a letter to the NIA about this
 NIA ne itane bade hamale kii jaanch main na to bastar ke tatkaaleen espi or aiji se poochtacha kii or na hi duusare jimmedaar police or prashasan ke afasaron se
 The Congress had found several flaws in the charge sheet presented by the NIA after its investigation
 lekin tatkaaleen sarkaar ne uski kisi bhi aapatti ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Therefore, the party fears that the incident has been carried out under a political conspiracy
 mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel ne NIA se jald se jald is ghatana kaa puraa byoraa maanga he, taaki SIT jaanch ko jald shuru kiya ja sake
 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel says it is part of a political conspiracy
 unki party ke kaaryakartaaon or chuninda netaaon ko shadyantr ke tahat maaraa gaya
 Now SIT investigation will reveal the reality
 rajya ke dijipi dm avasthi kaa kahana he ki NIA se puraa cese waapas maanga gaya he
 He has also sent a letter for this to the NIA
 unhone SIT ke sadasyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karne se inkaar kar diya
 State cabinet minister Umesh Patel, suffering from this incident, hoped that his government will bring the truth of this political conspiracy to everyone and the guilty will also be punished
 paanch saal baad bhi nahin puri hui jaanchaunia kii jaanch ke alaava rajya kii tatkaaleen bijepi sarkaar ne jheram ghati hatyakand kii jaanch ke liye 28 may 2013 ko ek nyaayik ayog kaa gathan kiya tha
 The judicial commission, headed by High Court Judge Prashant Kumar Mishra, was supposed to submit its inquiry report to the government within three months, but today even after five years, this commission has not been able to complete the investigation into the Jhiram Valley murder case
 alabatta uske kaarykaal main saal dar saal lagaataar vruddhi kii ja rahi he
 The judicial commission has so far recorded 70 people as witness statements
 isamen se 50 nijee vyakti he jabaki 20 sarkari gavaah he
 The Raman Singh government had also announced a CBI inquiry into the matter in the assembly, accepting the Congress's allegations of questioning the intent of the then BJP government's investigation and questionable role of several police officers
 lekin NIA kii jaanch or nyaayik ayog ke gathan kaa hawala dekar sibiai ne is maamle ko jaanch ke liye upyukt nahin mana
 Meanwhile, the police headquarters has started the process of formation of SIT
 naksali maamalon or krime control se jude chuninda afasaron kaa panel taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 sit's points of investigation are also being decided
 sirf chhattisgarh hi nahin balki desh main rajanetaaon kii ek saath hatya kii drushti se yah sabase bada maamla he
 The Congressmen contend that the security of Parivartan Yatra was completely deliberately ignored
 jabaki protocol ke tahat uske sabhi bade netaaon kii suraksha kii javabdehi chhattisgarh police or rajya sarkaar kii thi
 The road opening party was abruptly withdrawn during the Parivartan Yatra in Bastar
 congress kii yah bhi daleel he ki naksaliyon kaa itnaa bada jamghat jheram ghati main maujuud tha, lekin isaki jaankaree police or kufia vibhaag ko kyon nahin thi yah sochneey he
 Moreover, despite the death of 35 important persons, neither the BJP government took action against any police officer nor held anyone responsible for the incident
 yahi nahin in varshon main jheram ghaticand ko lekar naksaliyon or kuch sandehaaspad prabhaavshaalee vyaktiyon kii sidi bhi saamne ai thi, lekin rajya sarkaar ne isaki bhi jaanch se pallaa jhaad liya
 Therefore, the Congress government has tried to heal the sufferings of the victims of Jhiram Valley by setting up SIT

 (from input language) ( input bhashaa se ) In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, with the help of 'modi wave', the BJP had fed the lotus and painted the entire country in saffron
 narendra modi 282 loksabhaa siton ke saath satta par virajman hue
 In the 30 years after 1984, BJP became the first party to win a majority on its own
 lekin modi raaj ke chaar saal main ye rang feekaa padaa he
 At least this is the result of the Lok Sabha by-election, where the Modi government has had to bear the brunt of the shock from the opposition
 nateeja ye rahaa ki bijepi loksabhaa main 282 siton se ghatakar 270 par aa gai he
 By-elections have been held for 21 Lok Sabha seats in the country since 2014
 inamen se 11 siten bijepi ke kabje main thim lekin ab inamen se mahaj chaar siten hi bijepi barkaraar rakh saki he
 17 out of 21 seats were in the name of the opposition
 yani bijepi ne 7 siten ganvaa deen, teen par is samay upachunaav chal rahe hai jabaki do par karnataka main uske netaaon kaa istipha ho chukaa he
 Despite 270 seats, the BJP is still strong in power at the Center, but its dependence on its NDA alliance partners has increased
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 2014ke chunaav main do loksabhaa seat par chunaav lade the
 These included Vadodara in Gujarat and Varanasi seat in UP
 unhone donon siton par baari maton se jeet hasil karne ke baad vadodara seat se istipha de diya tha
 Like Modi, Mulayam Singh Yadav also won from Mainpuri and Azamgarh seats
 unhone mainpuri seat chhod di thi
 Apart from this, by-elections were also held on the vacant Beed Lok Sabha seat due to the death of Union Minister Gopinath Munde
 inamen se bijepi jahaan vadodara or bid seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahi, vahiin sapa ne bhi mainpuri seat bachaa lee
 bjp's defeat began with the ratlam-jhabua Lok Sabha by-election in Madhya Pradesh
 2015 main 'modi lahar' ke raste main rukaawat ratlam seat bani or bijepi ne is seat ko congress ke haathon ganvaa diya
 In the by-elections held since 2014, BJP has managed to save only 4 seats
 saal 2017 or 2018 main hue loksabhaa upachunaav main modi lahar kii raftaar kund padi
 BJP lost seats in Gurdaspur, Alwar, Ajmer, Gorakhpur, Phulpur
 2017 main punjab kii gurudaspur loksabhaa seat vinod khanna ke nidhan ke chalate rikt hui thi, jise congress ke sunil jakhad ne jeet liya
 In March this year, BJP got a tough defeat in UP by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur
 upi bijepi apane mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or up mukhyamantri keshav maury kii seat bachaane main bhi naakaamayaab rahi
 The bjp's defeat in these seats meant something different, because the SP-BSP, which had been an enemy for years in both the seats, had to compete with the BJP
 kairana, gondia-bhandara, palghar main ho rahe upachunaavphilhal, bijepi ke paas upi kii kairana, maharashtra kii gondia-bhandara or palghar main apni siten bachaane kii chunauti he
 Let the state of Kairana Lok Sabha seat remain vacant since the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh
 bhandara-gondia seat se pichley saal bijepi ke naanaa patole ne istipha de diya tha or ve congress main shaamil ho gaye the
 The Palghar seat is vacant after the death of BJP MP Chintamani Onega
 bijepi ko in teenon siton par vipaksh se kadi takkar kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 In Kairana, the entire opposition including the RLD-SP alliance is united before the BJP
 jabaki palghar or gondia-bhandara main use congress-ensipi kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 BJP leaders BS Yeddyurappa and b Sriramulu, who recently won the Karnataka Assembly elections, have resigned from the Lok Sabha membership

 In such a situation, the chairman of the National Film Awards Jury was seen favoring the decision to select filmmaker Priyadarshan Akshay Kumar for this award

 yah ek jivan kii kahani he
 ' is saal marathi film 'kaasav' ko sarvshereshth feechar film chunaa gaya he
 On regional cinema, Priyadarshan said, "regional cinema is not made with the goal of earning 100 crores

 aamir khan kii film 'dangal' ko is aword ke liye na chune jane par priyadarshan ne kaha, 'filmon ko dekhte samay hamane dekha ki kai sari bollywood kii filmein homosexuality par bani hui he
 These films are not raising real social issues at all

 Meanwhile, the judges have expressed surprise over the summoning of members of the Special Investigation Team by the Justice GT Nanavati Commission constituted to investigate these riots and seeking its report despite a clear order from the apex court

 In March 2012, the Special Investigation Team submitted its final report in the Gulberg Society case to the apex court

 He further said that "the current BJP government is the worst government ever
" is sarkaar ne yuvaaon, mahilaon, kisaanon, mazdooron, pichhadon va alpsankhyakon ko thagne kaa kaam kiya he''
 Shivpal said that due to the policies and economic mismanagement of the present BJP government, the economy of the country has been badly affected
 aaj ke daur main bhaajapa hamaare loktantr ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 But the unfortunate thing is that due to personal interest of SP, BSP and Congress, a decisive front could not be formed against BJP today
 unhone kaha ki sapa, basapa va congress ke saath milakar jo ladaai samuhik shakti se ladi jaani thi use kamjor kar diya gaya
 These parties are constantly doing politics sitting in the drawing room
 aaj jab vipaksh ko yah jarurat he ki vah sansad se lekar sadak tak aam aadmi kii awaz buland kare, tab ye partiyaan drawing room main baithkar secular shaktiyon ke khilaaf hi shadyantra kar rahi hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator India has provided many evidences and has repeatedly said that Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has been involved in the Mumbai attacks, but Pakistan ignored the matter

 India said this thing earlier and now America is also accepting that Pakistan's ISI has direct relation with 26 / 11 attacks
 bharat ke grih sachiv jike pillai ne pehle hi yah baat kahi thi ki mumbai hamalon par puri tarah iesai kaa niyantran tha or vahi ise sanchalit kar rahi thi
 According to the report, the isi's double game is now clear for the first time from the investigation

 There is many evidence of this

 After the Mumbai attacks, Pakistan arrested the military chief of Lashkar and put him in jail, but it was only a show

 Tahawwur Rana, acquitted by a Chicago court on charges of involvement in the Mumbai attacks, was pre-aware of the 26 / 11 attacks and was known to its insiders
 america abhiyojkon ke mutabik, asann hamalon ke bare main use lashkar-e-tayba ke pasha ne dubai main ek baithak ke dauraan jaankaree di
 Assistant Attorney Victoria Peters told the judges in a closed-room hearing before Rana's hearing in a Chicago court that the attack on the city of Mumbai was not unexpected for Rana
 use hamalon ke bare main jaankaree thi
 He already knew about this
 peters ne kaha, hamalon ke bare main use david hedli ne bataaya tha or vah isliye bhi is bare main jaanata tha kyonki dubai main pasha ne use jaankaree di thi
 He said that in the summer of 2008, Rana was told by his childhood friend Headley about the entire plot of the attack
 hedli ne mumbai hamalon main shaamil hone kii baat sweekaar kii he
 He said, he knew that the Lashkar fighters were finalizing the plan to attack Mumbai
 sahaayak atorni ne bataaya, rana ko hedli ne hamalon ke bare main bataaya tha lekin pasha ne bhi use is babat jaankaree di thi
 Headley told Pasha that while returning to America, he told Rana not to stay in Mumbai
 dubai main pasha ne vahi kiya
 He warns Rana about this
 aap rana ke die bayanon se hi jaanate hai ki use mumbai hamalon ke bare main pehle se jaankaree thi
 Peters gave written details of the conversation between Rana and Headley in this regard
 byora ke mutabik, hedli ne poocha, kya pasha ne aisa nahin kaha? rana : haa hedli : usne iskaa zikr kab kiya rana : kya, hedli :pasha ne bataaya tha ki dubai main is prakaar
 
 or rana ne kaha, or usne mujhe bhi aisa kaha america atorni ne bataaya ki pasha ne rana ko chetavanee di thi
 He said, this interaction between the jury members, Headley and Rana, is important
 isse maaloom chalata he ki pasha ne use chetaya tha ki hamalen asann hai? unhone kaha, yah baatcheet bataati he ki pasha ko maaloom tha ki rana andruni jaankaron main tha
 Pasha could count on Rana
 pasha ko maaloom he ki rana ko jaankaree he
 What if Rana was not an insider? What if Rana did not know at all that Mumbai was going to be attacked? The assistant attorney said, think about this
 kya aap ummid nahin karte ki agar use jaankaree thi ki hamale asann hai, kya aap usase ummid nahin karte jab hamale hue or mumbai ko jab in sashastr hamalwaron ne teen dinon tak bandhak banaae rakhaa to vah epabiai, police yaa kisi anya ke paas jaataa or kahata, dekhie, pasha naam kaa ek vyakti he jisase main dubai main mila or usne hamalon ke pehle mujhe jaankaree di ki main mumbai nahin jaaun
 He said, if Rana was not a member of the same party then why did Pasha inform him? Pasha had faith in Rana
 vah jaanata he ki rana hedli kaa vishwasaneey dost he, isliye isamen koi jokhim nahin he
 There is no risk in warning this

 Click here for registration in Sahitya Aaj Tak
 Why did Savarkar apologize? On the question of Savarkar apologizing to the British while in jail in Andaman, Desharatna Nigam said that Mercy Petition was one of his strategies
 apni teesri yachika main unhone kaha ki mere saath anya logon ko bhi reeha kiya jaae
 He wanted to come out of jail and work for the independence of the country
 lekin bhagat singh ne to maafee nahin maangi thi, is sawaal par nigam ne kaha ki kisi kii bhi tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 He said, 'can one compare Gandhi to the martyred revolutionaries, say that he was a coward when he spoke of non-violence? Everyone had a different strategy, but the goal was one - India's independence
 'ashutosh ne kaha ki andaman jail main saavarkar akele nahin the, 500 anya kaidi bhi the, to unhone kyon maafee nahin maangi
 In response, Vaibhav Purandare said that Aurobindo Ghosh had also written the Mercy Petition
 maafee mangakar karnaa kya chaahate theashutosh ne kaha ki asal sawaal to yah he ki aakhir saavarkar maafee mangakar karnaa kya chaahate the
 Irfan Habib said that a comparison should be made between those who were in cellular jail
 agar yah koi ranneeti thi to aakhir unhone jail se baahar aakar kya kiya
 The corporation said that Savarkar could not work for freedom struggle after coming out of jail because many kinds of restrictions were imposed on him
 nilanjan mukhopadhyaay ne kaha ki jail se aane ke baad unhone hindutv ke liye kaam kiya desh kii aazaadee ke liye nahin
 See the full coverage of Sahitya Aaj Tak here
 These are bigger crimes than Savarkar's crimes! Ashutosh said that Savarkar has to stand in the forefront because he supported the British people during the Quit India Movement in 1942
 hindu mahasabha ne ek prastaav ke dwaara iskaa samarthan kiya
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee allied with the Muslim League as a representation of the Hindu Mahasabha
 saavarkar ne angrejon ke liye sena kii bhartee kii, saavarkar ko gandhi hatya main giraftaar kiya gaya
 In response, the corporation said that 95 percent of Congressmen also opposed Quit India
 gandhi ji kii raay haaavee thi
 It is on record that many Congress leaders said that this is not the appropriate time
 nigam ne kaha ki saavarkar ne isliye logon ko sena main shaamil hone ko kaha taaki log trend hokar aaen or phir swatantraaa sangram main hissaa len
 Vaibhav Purandare said that he probably wanted to enlist in the army of Hindus to compete with the Muslims, at that time there were more Muslims in the British Army
 saavarkar ne hitler kaa samarthan kiya to kya, subhash chandra bose ne bhi madad lee thiakhir saavarkar ne najeevaad, fasiwad or hitler kaa samarthan kyon kiya? is par nilanjan mukhopadhyaay ne kaha ki headgavar or munje bhi hitler ke samarthak the
 But in response, the Sangh's enabling corporation said that Subhash Chandra Bose also took the cooperation of Hitler and Japan
 isi tarah kii soch ke tahat saavarkar madad lenaa chaahate the
 He had a strategy in front of him
 bada lakshya tha bharat kii aazaadee kaa
 Nilanjan said on this that even Subhash Chandra Bose is not beyond questions
 purandare ne kaha ki saavarkar kii tulana kisi or se karnaa thik nahin he
 Savarkar's work has to be seen in two phases
 unako mil rahi sajaa bahut hi sakht thi, isliye saavarkar sahit kai senaniyon ne isamen raahat dene kii maang kii
 Subhash Chandra Bose also expressed happiness over Savarkar's release
 kya gandhi hatya main saavarkar kaa yogadan thaashutosh ne kaha ki court ne pramaan na hone par gandhi hatya main saavarkar ko bari kiya tha
 The Kapoor Commission held him guilty
 iske jawaab main deshratn nigam ne kaha ki jab court yah kahata he ki koi aisa pramaan nahin he jisase is hatya main saavarkar ko conect kiya ja sake to aap use kis tarah se maanenge
 The Kapoor Commission was not a court, it was formed by the Congress for political purpose
 nilanjan mukhopadhyaay ne kaha ki ise laal bahadur shastri ne gathit kiya tha to aap kis tarah se dekhenge jinhen ki aap log behatar pradhanmantri bate hai
 Nilanjan said that Nathuram was the editor of the newspaper that Savarkar had founded
 is akhbaar ke mastahed par saavarkar kaa naam tha
 In response, the corporation said that no one knows what was discussed in Savarkar's last meeting with Nathuram
 iske bare main keval kayaas hi hai
 No one can prove that there was talk about Mahatma Gandhi's assassination
 purandare ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi kii hatya main saavarkar kaa haath hone kaa koi legal pramaan nahin he, lekin unhone godse and company kaa samarthan kiya jo ki galat he
 Relationship writer Irfan Habib, who was in Savarkar and Sangh, said that Savarkar and RSS, who were close to the RSS, adopted his Hindutva thinking
 unhone ki aresas ke log apane jin adarsh nayakon kii baat karte hai, jinke bare main kehete hai ki unhane swatantraaa sangram main hissaa liya, unka naam neshnal archive main kyon nahin he
 Vaibhav Purandare said that there can be two reasons for this
 headgavar asal main saavarkar ke hindutv se prerit the
 This was the Holi text for the RSS
 aresas ke liye saavarkar freedom fiter the
 His concept of Hindutva was also found in the idea of RSS
 donon hindu aakraamakata main vishwaas karte the
 He said that Congress may have done wrong for many years, but the right-wing people cannot hide behind their mistakes
 agar ham kitaab likhte hai, to kisi sarkaar ke dam par to nahin, hamane vyaktigat kshamta se kitaaben likhi hai, to dakshinpanthi lekhakon ko apana itihaas likhane se kisne roka tha
 Ashutosh said that people of ASS ideology have always said that history was written by leftists
 yah soch asal main unki infiriurity complex or badale kii raajnneeti kii vajah se he
 Comparing the two parts of Savarkar's own life is quite a contradiction
 andaman jane ke baad alag tarah ke saavarkar hai
 He is the ideological foundation head of the RSS
 saavarkar zyada political the
 When talking about the present, the RSS talked about the future
 ashutosh ne kaha, 'atal bihari kaa karishma kam hone ke baad jab modi ji aae, pehle unhone sabko milakar chalane kii baat kii, lekin nahin chal paae to phir karishma par aa gaye
 Did not Savarkar get due respect in 6 years of Atal Bihari? Subhas Chandra Bose was also subjected to various restrictions and went to Japan
 aaazaad hind fouj kii sthapana kii
 Who prevented Savarkar from doing this? Golwalkar had said that the RSS will not take part in the freedom struggle, this is a historical proof
 golwalkar ne kaha ki hamaara yuva digbhramit ho gaya he
 On this, Neelanjan Mukhopadhyay said that Vajpayee had also tried to confer Bharat Ratna, but the President rejected, he tried to put his portrait in the Lok Sabha
 gandhi hatya ke baad saavarkar jail gaye, aresas ke netaa jail gaye
 After independence, Savarkar was not going to be named, but Indira Gandhi praised him, a documentary was made on him
 sach to yah he ki saavarkar or aresas main achche relation nahin the
 Three stages of Savarkar's life are seen
 1911 ke pehle ve swatantraaa senaanee the jab 1857 ko pehla swatantraaa sangram bataane vaali kitaab likhi, iske baad unka guru of hindutv vaala phej aayaa, jo 1921 tak rahaa
 After this, when he was released from Andaman jail, then a different kind of phase followed
 deshratn nigam ne kaha, 'aresas kii sadsyta kaaphi anaupchaarik hoti he, jo bhi shakha gaya ho vah aresas kaa sadsy ho saktaa he
 We offer many people to join the association, some join and some support from outside
 'unhone kaha ki aresas kaa maananaa he ki is desh main jo bhi rahata he vah hindu he, jabaki saavarkar muslim, isai ko is daayre se baahar rakhte hai
 He laid the foundation for the freedom struggle
 bharatiyon ke liye koi ek-do adarsh nahin ho sakate
 Savarkar was ignored for nearly 70 years
 headgavar, golwalkar ko bhi nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 Is the rss's contribution to the Freedom Struggle? The rss's contribution to the Freedom Struggle is zero
 On this question, the corporation said, 'before Independence, everyone joined the Congress and joined the freedom struggle
 khud sangh ke sansthaapak dow
 Hedgewar was in Congress, if he had ideological differences, he went to jail twice
 asahyog andolan, kashmir par kabayaliyon ke akraman ke samay sangh ke swayamsevakon ne kaam kiya
 After so much controversy, why did Savarkar get Bharat Ratna? Nigam said that Congress gave Bharat Ratna to Indira Gandhi's son Rajiv Gandhi, Savarkar is 100 times better than him
 bharat ratna aise vyakti ko dena chahie jisane swatantraaa sangram main hissaa liya ho, jisaki rihaai kaa subhash chandra bose ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 In democracy, it is the choice of the people whether to give Bharat Ratna or not
 headgavar, golwalkar ko bharat ratna milane ke sawaal par nigam ne kaha ki khud dow
 Hedgewar, Golwalkar was against taking any award, it is part of his philosophy
 aresas kisi tarah ke puraskaar milane kii soch ke tahat kaam nahin karata
 He is running over 1 lakh service projects

 Thirteen people, including 12 children trapped in a flood-ravaged cave in Thailand, were safely evacuated, but the dispute over the entire mission continued to escalate after news of the children being given a tranquilizer (sedative to soothe) during the rescue operation However, the Thai Prime Minister has denied giving any medicine such as anesthesia
 haalankigupha se sakushal baharnikaalane ke abhiyaan main shaamil ek british diver (gotaakhor) ne daawa kiya he ki gupha se baahar nikaalane se pehlebacchon ko nashili ketamine dawaadi gai
 Given to protect against fear, the Daily Mail quoted the British diver as saying that he was told that children had been given ketamine, called a horse or cat traangculizer, usually used to mentally calm street animals
 Is made to live
 kai anya gotakhoron ne bhi bacchon ko aisi dawa die jane kii baat kahi he
 Divers associated with the Rescue Mission say that after being given this medicine, the children became completely calm and were no longer on their own
 vah ek tarah se behoshee kii haalat main chale gaye
 The rationale behind giving medicines like Trangqualizers is that they may be scared and scared while taking the children in water, which would have affected the campaign
 kyon di gai ketaminaketamine aamtaur par halke pile rang kaa hota he
 This medicine is given in the event that one has to relieve pain, be taken in a state of unconsciousness, or remove mental tension
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki gupha main fanse bacchon ko nikaalane se pehle achet karne vaali dawa di gai thi taaki wo andhere, sankare or pani ke neeche ke raaston se guzarate hue bhaybheet or aatankit na hon or bachaav dal main shaamil logon ko atirikt dikkaton kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 After ketamine is given, it is normal for the human heart to function and throb
 injection se dawa die jane ke baad iskaa asar 5 minute main dikhne lagata he or 25 minute main yah puri tarah se asardaar ho jaataa he
 How harmful ketamine is, however it can also have the opposite effect, due to which they are afraid of nervousness, distraction and hallucinations as well as increased blood pressure and heartbeat
 blad pressure girane kii sthiti main saans lene takalif ho sakati he
 In such a situation, the difficulty of breathing in the cave would increase which would have come to the lives of the children trapped in the cave
 thailandke pradhanmantri ne aisi kisi bhi hanikaarak dawa die jane se inkaar kiya he, lekin unhone mana ki bacchon ko ek dawa di gai jo aamtaur par sainikon ko di jaati he, jisase dar kam hota he
 Currently, the children have now left and are undergoing treatment in the hospital, their families are not being allowed to meet them
 parijan unhen shishe rupi diwaar ke peeche se dekh sakate hai
 After being in the cave for more than 2 weeks, the children who have been taken out are being kept away from their families so that they do not have any kind of infusion

 We have been getting frantic calls from the public regarding today’s NGT order on # Amarnath Yatra 
 i have spoken to the Chairperson of the Board, Governor Vohra about this
 We will be convening an emergency meeting of Sri Amarnath ji Shrine board to discuss the same
 No Puja commences in temples without ringing the bell and chanting of the mantras
 # Amarnath # NGT seems less concerned about the environment and more concerned about policing Hindus by dictating how to pray & how they should lead their life
 In ngts language, it seems like Hindus are responsible for half of worlds carbon footprint
 # amarnathwe have full faith & respect in # NGT but can't they respect our religious Sentiments & right to protect, profess & practice # Hindu dharma at least in # Amarnath # Temple at high altitude of Himalayan region

 Asked about the challenge faced by the aggressive opening pair of Chris Gayle and Dwayne Smith, Raina said that the West Indies team would be completely different as there are many players in his team who can hit sixes but they need to strike against the spinners
 There is no idea of rotating one or two runs
 unhone kaha ki isliye ham jitna zyada dabaav bade khilaadiyon par banaaenge, utana hi hamaare liye behatar hoga
 The in-form left-handed batsman said that Amit Mishra's bowling would prove to be crucial again to deal with Gayle, Smith and Samuels
 raina ne kaha ki hamaare paas mishra he, jinhone pichley match main acha pradarshan kiya he
 Ashwin has also bowled well and Jadeja is also doing well
 lekin tii20 is baat par nirbhar karata he ki koun sa gendbaaj match ke din kaisaa pradarshan karata he
 He said that it also depends on what you want to do after winning the toss
 is match main spinner ahm honge
 Especially given the kind of bowling we did against Pakistan, because the Pakistani team plays spin very well

 He said, "IPL has not only increased the earnings of Indian domestic cricketers but it gives them an opportunity to play with top players and learn from the best coaches in the world, they improve their cricket skills fast

 aise main ve log apni rakam haar jaaenge, jinhone bhaajapa par daanv lagaaya tha
 While the Congress seats are seen approaching 80

 Judges from the fast track court to the Supreme Court should lock in their court room and go to Shimla and eat almonds liberated there
 kyonki unka kaam khatm ho gaya he
 Because from the social media to the oath of the constitution, and the social workers who came on TV have justified an antisocial act of Telangana police
 purushon ke alaava bahut si mahilaayein bhi us public opinian ko banane main lagi hai or apane banaae opinian kii aad main is encounter ko sahi tehra rahi hai
 It is the same public opinion that thinks in a way when killing Akhlaq and Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh in public, standing with the crowd and it is the same public opinion that becomes a mob over the encounter of Telangana Police
 kya public openian ab adaalat he? to phir adaalaton ko faisle se pehle twitor par jaakar dekhnaa chahie ki aaj kaa trend kya he
 Everyone knows that there is anger about this incident
 mahilaon main gussa he to us gusse main jagah banane ke liye mahila saansad bhi encounter ko sahi bataa rahi hai
 Prime Minister Modi recently sought votes for Sasibhushan Mehta in Jharkhand who is accused of killing a female teacher and is on bail in the case
 kya smriti irani kaa gussa vaisaa hi hoga jaisaa telugana maamle main tha? kya wo sansad se yah jaanakar istipha de dengi? yah jaanakar unke sahyogi saansad sakshi maharaj balaatkaar or hatya ke aaropee vidhayak kuldeep singh senger ko janmdin par shubhakamanaayen de rahe hai
 mlas from Bangarmau are chanting to congratulate Kuldeep
 to tab or ab smriti irani kya kar lengi?ek saansad balaatkaar or hatya ke aaropee ke encounter ko sahi tehraati hai or ek saansad balaatkaar ke aaropee ko janmdin kii mubaarakabaad dete hai
 According to the ADR report, 19 mps are accused of violence against women and three are accused of rape
 kya unke liye mahila saansad loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha ke bheetar encounter kii maang karengi? purv grih rajya mantri or bijepi ke purv saasand swami chinmayanand par jab ladki swami par balaatkaar or yon shoshan ke aarope lage tab bhi kya smriti irani or jaya bachchan bhadudi ko itnaa gussa aayaa tha?jo log apni zimmedaariyon main fail ho gaye vahi public opinian ko hawa dekar rahe hai
 a bizarre argument is being made that the issue of Telangana encounter should be stopped
 matlab sawaal na karen
 Questioning the encounter is a political one, so will it be applicable with every encounter that we will not question it
 jis telugana police ko lekar sawaal uth rahaa tha ki jab peedita ke parivaar vaale police ke paas gaye to do ghante tak kuch nahin kiya
 Said to have run away to meet a friend
 is maamle main teen police vaale suspend bhi hue the
 The police, which did not speed up security in the area when there was another incident before it, may also not have sufficient resources for investigation and security, now pushing all these questions and ending the case on celebration of the encounter being done
 police mahaan bana di gai he
 The picture that is being showered on the Telangana Police is showing how weak the understanding and trust in the general public about the justice system has become
 kanoon kaa system lanbaa vakt letaa he yaa kaam nahin karata he, iske naam par encounter kii theory ko bina jaanche parakhe swaagat ke cond main badal diya gaya he
 Not even trusting the law and demanding strict legislation
 sakht kanoon to he
 After the Nirbhaya scandal, Justice Verma's committee gave many measures
 nirbhaya fund bana jiskaa paisa kharch nahin ho sakaa
 By removing all these questions, a crowd has been formed which is welcoming this encounter
 kya vaaki is kahani par koi vishwaas kar rahaa he ki jab police in aparaadhiyon ko lekar saboot ikatthe karne lagi tab in logo ne police par pattharon se hamalaa kar diya
 Snatched the weapon and shot if not surrendered
 kya vaaki logon ne sochna band kar diya he ki farji se lagane vaali is kahani par phool barasaa rahe hai? jab sabooton ke aadhaar par police ne inhen pakadaa tha to in par aarope sabit karne kaa prayaas kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Was it Encountered that the Public Opinion would welcome
 saansad bhi log swaagat karenge
 Questions are being raised on every theory of the police
 police kahati he ki apradhi anbhavi the unase hathiyaar chin kar chalaane lage
 Even though the policemen were experienced, no policeman was shot
 police kii goli se chaaron ke chaar aaropee mar gaye
 The accused also attacked the police with stones
 donon ghayal police waalon kii medical bulatin kahati he ki ek jawan ke maathe par kuch karonche ain hai
 The other has deep wounds on his hands and shoulders
 filmon main bhi ab aisi kahani nahin banati he
 The audience gets to know
 ve hansane lagate hai
 Commissioner Sajjanar Saheb who is telling the story, which sounds like a story to hear
 encounter ke kai ghante ke baad shavon ko vahiin pade rahane diya gaya taaki log aakar dekhte rahen
 Made in the Favor of a Public Opinion Encounter
 police kiskaa intazaar kar rahi thi? aap internet search kiijie
 Such stories made by the police will force you to think
 aise kai cese hai jisamen police ne is tarah kii kahani banaakar bekasoor logon ko maar diya or unhen apradhi bataa diya
 In 2009, Uttarakhand's police shot 29 bullets by taking Ranbir Singh, an MBA student from Ghaziabad, to the forests of Dehradur
 kaha ki ranbir singh phiroti kaa kaam karata tha
 9 years later, in 2018, 7 policemen were sentenced to life by the Delhi High Court
 1992 main punjab police ne 15 saal ke ek ladke kaa ancounter kar diya
 The story made that the children had fired on the police for 20 minutes
 2018 main sibiai kii adaalat ne is encounter ko farji paaya or punjab police ke do sipaahiyon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa di
 In November 1996, UP Police picked up Jalaluddin, Jasbir, Ashok and Pravesh and made an encounter
 bataaya ki ye apradhi the
 Till 2017, family members fought the case
 sibiai court ne chaar police waalon ko hatya ke maamle main doshi paaya
 The encounter turned out to be fake
 jab kabhi police encounter kii kahani banaae, hameshaa us par shaq karnaa chahie or sawaal karnaa chahie
 This is the history of the encounter cases
 pariwaron ne 20-20 saal court main mukadmaa ladaa he
 The boys also lost their lives and were falsely accused of being criminals
 abhi haal main chhattisgarh se ritred justise agarwal kii report ai ki 2012 main bastar main siarpief or police ne 17 logon ko farji tareeke se naksal bataakar maar diya tha
 It also had six children
 jis tarah naklsi ko lekar public openian bana diya jaataa he us tarah se to is hatya ko bhi sahi tehra diya jaataa
 Should the justice of the encounter with the police be decided for a fake encounter? Think properly why many people are happy about the encounter of the Telangana police? If the encounter is correct then why is there a justice system? Then are you ready that the police will accept what they say, the court does not consider the crime confessed in front of them? Are you with this encounter to be with the crowd, then in 2017 more than 32 thousand cases of rape were registered
 kya sabhi main encounter kii vyavastha kar di jaae?kai charchaaon main sunne ko mila ki hyderabad main toll ke paas police kii suraksha paryaapt nahin thi
 Why was there no CCTV? yah sawaal uthta he or bich main gum ho jaataa he
 Rather, this question needed to be given some space
 duniya main aise kai shodh ho chuke hai jo bataate hai ki aadhunik shahar ke jo dizine hai wo bhi mahilaon yaa kamazor ke liye asuraksha kaa maahaul banaate hai
 The place where the victim was raped and burnt in Hyderabad was also deserted
 vahaan awajahi kam thi
 The light was low
 ab kai staron par adhyayan bataata he ki dizine hi is tarah se kiya jaae ki dur dur tak log nazar na aaen
 There should not be a vendor on the sidewalk
 keval rasta ho taaki automobil yani kaaron ke liye super fast raste hon
 Jane Jacob has written a book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) says that cities are not built according to the people
 is tarah banaaya gaya ki dur dur tak log na dikhen
 All the places are being built according to automobiles
 automobil ne shaharon ko barbaad kar diya
 Due to this, unsafe corners are formed
 is lihaaj se aap ghatana sthal ko dekhen or samajhen
 There are only train routes here
 aadmi ke aane jane kii suvidha nahin he
 Designs are done in such a way that far-flung areas start appearing uninhabited
 ab jab encounter ke baad yahaan itane log dekhte hai, tab log nazar aa rahe the
 Will people be visible all the time? Find out the answer will be found in no
 agar logon se jod kar sadaken bani hoti hai to aparaadh kam hota
 But the answer to this question will not be found easily
 milegaa to aapako yakeen nahin hoga ki amal bhi hoga
 Installing a street light makes a difference in crime, but how many cities are there where street lights are installed
 isliye aap faansee kii sazaa maangane lagate hai, jaanate hue bhi ki maut sazaa nahin he
 Now they are clapping on the encounter demanding execution of the sentence knowing that most of the encounters are fake
 yah chhot aapane rajya sarkaar ko de di to kal kisi ko uthaakar police encounter kar degi to phir aap kis samaaj or santhaan ke paas insaaf ke liye jaaenge
 In 2014, the Supreme Court issued a guideline regarding the encounter
 16 bindu ke dishanirdesh hai
 Some are as follows
 
 
 - encounter ke baad maamle kii exiaar darj hogi or ilaake se sambandhit court bheji jaaegi - SP rank officers will investigate and investigation will be scientific - encounter kii magistrate se jaanch hogi - a team of two doctors will conduct a post-mortem of those killed - jab tak jaanch puri nahin hoti, encounter main shaamil police team ko baari se pehle tarakkee nahin milegibaari se pehle tarakkee nahin milegi
 Many times encounters are also done so that promotions are found
 unnav main balaatkaar kii peedita court ja rahi thi
 He was burnt on the way
 police aisi peeditaaon ko suraksha nahin degi balki kai baar balaatkaar ke aropiyon ke paksh main hi khadi nazar aati he, us police ko kaise kaam karnaa chahie iske liye system hona chahie yaa encounter kii chhot ye aap thik se soch len
 If this becomes a routine, then think about who will be killed
 garib maare jaaenge
 People like Kuldeep Singh Sengar will be left with money
 aap twitor par jaakar keval un logon ke twit dekh len jo telugana police ke encounter ko saport kar rahe hai
 From the morning without knowing the facts, the message started running in whatsapp University that if you are in support of the encounter, then if you are not in support of rapists
 encounter ko galat kehane kaa yah bilkul matlab nahin he ki koi balaatkaariyon ke saport main he
 After all, why can't the police prove it on the basis of their investigation? Recently, the Supreme Court ordered that forensic labs be set up in every district
 system banane ke saare sawaal peeche chale gaye
 Encounters are being made on the encounter so that the message will be sent to the people that huge work has been done
 isi agast maheene main da hindu akhbaar main arunabh kaul ne fast trek court kaa vishleshan kiya tha
 Smriti Irani had said in Rajya Sabha that 1023 fast track courts will be set up across the country by spending 2250 crores so that cases of sexual violence with children can be heard quickly
 supreme court ne bhi usee dauraan aadesh diya tha ki jahaan bhi pokso ke 100 se adhik cese lambit hai, vahaan par special court bananaa chahie or har zile main forencik lab bananaa chahie
 Since 2000, 581 fast track courts have been opened across the country where 5 lakh 90 thousand cases are pending
 ye fast trek court kaa haal he
 The maximum number of cases are pending in UP
 ravishankar prasad ne sansad main bataaya he ki aadhe se adhik rajyon main jaise karnataka, gujarat or madhya pradesh main fast trek court hi nahin he
 The National La University of Delhi did a survey by the fast track court
 kai court main peedita ke audio video recording kii vyavastha nahin thi to kisi main regular staff tak nahin tha
 This is the Hindi report
 na police kaa system thik he or na court kaa, lekin isi kharaab system ne kai aise faisle die hai jinamein jaanch ke baad aparaadhiyon ko sazaa di gai he
 It is possible the court has failed people
 police ne logon ko fail kiya lekin iske baad bhi bheed kii hinsa or encounter samaadhaan nahin hai
 Still stop thinking like a crowd
 naagarik kii tarah sochie
 This cannot be the basis that all political party mps are supporting? Think for yourself that you are giving a license to the police to sneak into your houses and kill them
 aapane chhattisgarh main dekha ki farji tareeke se bacchon tak ko naksali bataakar maar diya gaya
 In 2016 and 2017, the Supreme Court had asked the CBI to investigate the 1528 encounters in Manipur
 jaanch shuru ho gai he
 In 2018, 700 army officers wrote a letter that if the morale of the army falls, the Supreme Court said that there is no point in morale falling
 ise saport karne ke liye koi saamagree nahin he
 If morale falls, they have a weakness
 encounter ke samarthan main khadey hone police ko hi nahin, us bheed ko bhi license dena he jo aise aarope ke naam par kisi ko maar sakati he
 When a dancer stopped dancing at a wedding in Chitrakoot, UP, a domineering enraged shot the dancer

 sonia gandhi kareeb do saal baad mangalvaar ko apane sansadeey kshetra raibareli do divasiy daure par pahunchi hai
 After June 2016, Sonia's absence in her constituency Rae Bareli was gradually becoming a matter of concern for the people of the region
 aise main sonia kii duuri unka vikalp talashne ke liye majaboor kar rahi thi
 Not only this, BJP is also trying to make a break in the fort of Sonia
 aise samay main sonia kii raibareli main dastak congressiyon ko raahat degi
 Let me tell you that Sonia Gandhi was successful in saving her fort in the wake of the Congress's defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad se sonia ke raibareli aane ke silsilaa dhire-dhire kam hone laga
 Sonia's health was also a big reason behind this, due to which she was not able to visit Rae Bareli as before
 congress adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhike tajposhi ke baad sonia gandhi ne apane sansadeey kshetra kii taraf rukh kiya he
 Sonia, who arrived in Rae Bareli on a two-day visit, laid the foundation stone of several schemes
 kai sadakon kaa locarpan kiya
 Not only this, he also met the officials of many organizations
 saath hi party ke varisht netaaon ke saath aane vaale chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke bare main bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 After almost two years, Sonia Gandhi has come to Rae Bareli at a time when the BJP is trying to spread its foot in the politics of the district
 raibareli se congress party ke emelsi dinesh pratap singh apane vidhayak bhai or jila panchayat avadhesh pratap singh ke saath party ko alavida kahkar bijepi jwine karne kii dhamkee dete najar aa rahe hai
 Some BJP workers in Rae Bareli may be protesting about Dinesh Singh joining the BJP
 lekin senior netaa or party alaakaman dinesh singh kii peshkash ko thukaraate hue najar nahin aa rahe hai
 It is clear that this is part of the bjp's strategy to surround the Congress in the fort of Sonia
 iske jariye bijepi desh kii siyasat main maahaul banane kii koshish karegi, isiilie party adhyaksh amit shah 21 april ko raibareli ke daure par pahunch rahe hai
 Dinesh Singh is a big face in the politics of Rae Bareli
 wo jahaan khud emelsi hai to unke ek bhai harchandrapur se vidhayak or ek bhai jila panchayat adhyaksh hai
 All three have won on the Congress ticket
 aise main bijepi main shaamil hote hai to ye congress ke liye jile main bada jhatka hoga
 After this, the Congress will have only one MLA left in Rae Bareli
 vah vidhayak bhi us bahubali akhilesh singh kii beti aditi singh hai jinhen congress ke naam se kam akhilesh kii beti ke rup main zyada janaa jaataa he
 Akhilesh Singh has also been an MLA from the Congress, but was expelled from the party after the assassination of Rakesh Pandey
 iske baavjood apane boote par jitate rahe hai, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh singh kii beti aditi singh ne congress kaa daaman thama or record maton se jeet hasil kii
 After this, Akhilesh's close aide was given ticket in Rae Bareli municipality and Congress managed to win
 akhilesh singh gaahe-bagaahe congress sanghathan to kabhi party ke aalaa netaaon ke bare main kuch ulta sidhaa bol dete hai
 Not only this, PM Modi and CM Yogi are seen reading the praises of the government
 aisi sthiti main raibareli kaa congressi jan sonia ke aane kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 After Sonia's arrival, at least on the faces of party workers who were clouded with despair
 wo jarur kam honge

 chayansmiti ke sutron ne kaha, ‘yah unke fitness praaanpatr par nirbhar karegaa jo unhen ensie se milegaa
 'the first Test match against New Zealand will be played in Hyderabad while the second Test match will be played in Bangalore from 31 August
 sutron ne kaha, ‘lakshmana ko lekar do tarah ke vichaar hai
 One feels that before the series against England, we should give the youngsters a chance, while others believe that Laxman should get a chance to play at home
 ’captain mahendra singh dhoni or coach dancan flachar bhi baithak main upasthit rahenge
 Incidentally, this is India's first Test series after a 0–4 defeat to Australia earlier this year
 tendulkar srilanka main haal main samaapt hui ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa khilne ke liye nahin gayi the
 He is now ready to play against New Zealand

 inamen se austrailia ke khilaaf bangalore main apane pehle test match main hi unhone 72 ran kii joardaar pari kheli thi jisase bharat lakshya hasil karne main safal rahaa tha
 The most interesting issue in the meeting on Friday will be the attitude of the selection committee regarding Laxman's future
 kayaas lagaaye ja rahe hai ki hyderabad main hone vaala pehla test match is hyderaabadi kaa aakhri match ho saktaa he
 In the Australian tour, Laxman was able to score only 155 runs in eight innings
 unki fitness or viketon ke bich daud par bhi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 The Indian cricketer 'very Very Special' is around 38 years old
 chayansmiti lakshmana ke anubhav ko dhyaan main rakhkar unhen bharat main hone vaale agle das test maichon main mauka de sakati he
 In the event of Dravid retiring and exiting Laxman, only Tendulkar will be an experienced batsman in the middle order

 The fitness of Sehwag and Zaheer has also been questioned
 ye donon hi srilanka se twanti-20 match se pehle hi swadesh laut aaye the
 There is still two weeks left in the New Zealand series and by then both of them are likely to be fit
 irfan pathan ne bhi srilanka main acha alround pradarshan kiya tha or unhen alrounder ke taur par 15 sadasyeey team main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he lekin unhen antim ekadash main jagah milane kii ummid nahin he
 The selection of off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha is certain
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki anbhavi of spinner harbhajan singh ko team main liya jaataa he yaa nahin
 He has played three first-class matches for the county team Essex so far and has got only two wickets
 yadi harbhajan ko phir se nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he to rahul sharma ko team main liya ja saktaa he
 There are many contenders for the 15th member in the team
 rohit bhale hi farm main nahin hai lekin unki pratibha ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Suresh Raina's name can also be considered due to the lack of good fast bowlers in the New Zealand team and being on slow pitches at Uppal and Chinnaswamy Stadium

 Betty was so distracted by the incident that she spent the next two days running a signature campaign and gathering signatures of 6,000 people to establish peace in the province

 Those three children, whom she did not even know, changed Betty's life in a completely new direction

 kya bharat ab china se muqabla kar paane main sakasham he? darasal jab se china ne bharat ko chetavanee di he ki bhartiya sena ko itihaas se mili sabak, yani 1962 kii ladaai main mili haar, se sikh leni chahie tab se ek baar phir se yah bahes chali padi he ki kya bharat ab china se muqabla kar paane main sakasham he? yaa phir ab vah use chhodkar aage bad chalaa he
 Meanwhile, Defense Minister Arun Jaitley has added to the tension in response to China's threat by saying that there is a difference between India of 1962 and India of 2017
 tab alag halaat the or ab halaat alag hai
 If we consider the opinion of defense experts in 'global Times', then it seems that if the current situation is not resolved, then China can do anything to protect its territory and even go to the extent of war
 idhar bharat sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vartmaan tanaav ke liye bharat katai jimmedaar nahin he balki yah vivaad mul rup se china or bhutan ke bich teen dashakon se jari he
 China's interference in the region could also threaten India's sovereignty, so India also had to play its part
 vaise hamen yahaan yah bhi nahi bhoolanaa chahie ki agar ham 1962 kii tulana main behad majboot hue hai or hamaare desh ne kaaphi tarakkee kii he to china kii raftaar to hamase kahin zyada he
 Today's China is also not 1962 China, but it has gone much further than then
 yah sarvavidit he ki 1962 kii ladaai main bharat ko china ke haathon karaari haar mili thi
 About 1300 soldiers of India were killed and a thousand soldiers were injured in that battle
 dedh hajaar sainik laapata ho gaye the or kareeb chaar hajaar sainik bandi bana liye gaye the
 At the same time, about 700 Chinese soldiers were killed and over one and a half thousand were injured
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar china ne itihaas se sabak lene kii chetavanee bharat ko di he
 Now let's understand why, once again, there is a rift between India and China over the border? The doca-la area that caused the dispute is located in the Chumbi Valley region between Sikkim and Bhutan in India
 china main ise daanglang or bhutan main doklam ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There has been a long-standing dispute between China and Bhutan about this, which has been held since 1984 to resolve 24 negotiations
 bharat isliye chintit he ki bhutan kaa yah ilaaka, jahaan china sadak banane kii koshish kar rahaa he, thik uske neeche he
 'chicken Neck' is the region that connects north-east India with the rest of the country
 agar yahaan sadak ban jaati he to yah sidhe china kii topon kii range main aa jayega
 At present, India is in a strong position in this area
 hamaari saare postein oonchai par hai jabaki china yahaan neeche he
 It is strategically quite advantageous in hilly areas
 yahaan bharat ke pair ukhaadne ke liye china ko kaaphi dam lagaana padegaa
 When i talked to many experts about this who keep a close watch on india-china relations, everyone was unanimous that the situation has changed a lot since 1962
 beshak china samrik taur par hamase kai maamalon main kaaphi aage nikal chukaa he or yadi kisi vajah se ladaai ke halaat bane to hamaare jeetne kii sambhaavnaaen kaaphi kam hongi, par china ke liye bhi yah ladaai ab utani aasaan nahin hogi
 By the way, in terms of military and weapons, India has become much stronger than before but not as much compared to China
 khaskar agar sarhad par dekhen to jis tarah se china ne apane buniyadi dhaanche ko majboot kiya he uski tulana main hamaara aadharbhoot dhaancha abhi bhi kamjor he
 If we are planning to take the rail to the border with China, then it has reached the border
 bhartiya seemaa main sadak maarg kii haalat bhi khasta hi bani hui he
 Yes, many airfields along the border with China have been modernized so that our combat aircraft can fly from there immediately if needed and the logistics and support can be provided by transport planes immediately
 vaise 1962 ke bharat-china yuddh ke bare main jo jaankaree saamne ai he usase lagata he us vakt ke raajnneetik netritv or sena ke kai cmanderon ne apni javabdehi thik se nahin nibhaai jisaki vajah se bharat ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 It is said that neither the army was ready to fight, nor did it have clothes nor weapons
 rahi sahi kasar mausam ne puri kar di thi
 Many Air Force strategists have not yet been able to understand why the Air Force was not used in the war at that time as the Indian Air Force was much better at that time than the Chinese Air Force
 haalanki sena pramukh general bipin ravat kaa kahana he ki bharat dhai front se nipatane ke liye taiyaar he
 This includes dealing with internal threats within the country apart from China and Pakistan
 china ko yah baaten hajam nahin huin or usne bina sena pramukh kaa naam liye ise gairjimmedaarana bayaan bataaya
 Not only this, the spokesman of the People's Liberation Army said that the people of the Indian Army should learn from the history and stop making noise about the war in this way
 vaise yah bhi hakeekat he ki keval sena ke boote china ko bharat dhamka nahin saktaa
 Our military is not that strong compared to China
 tippaniyan Contrary to Army Chief General Rawat's statement last year, the then co-air Force Chief and now the current Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanova, admitted that the Air Force lacked fighter jets and to fight with the Air Force in the face of war on two fronts Not enough resources
 thal sena or vayusena ke bayaan main yah antar is baat ko saaf karata he ki bharat, china kaa muqabla ab bhi aasaani se nahin kar saktaa
 However, what China knows, everyone knows that the fight is no longer a matter of any country
 haa bas iske naam par dabaav jarur banaaya ja saktaa he
 The truth is that the friendship between India, America and Japan is not appealing to China, so he is doing all this to create pressure so that the friendship of these three countries does not prevail and he dominates the region
 haalanki sena pramukh general bipin ravat kaa kahana he ki bharat dhai front se nipatane ke liye taiyaar he
 This includes dealing with internal threats within the country apart from China and Pakistan
 china ko yah baaten hajam nahin huin or usne bina sena pramukh kaa naam liye ise gairjimmedaarana bayaan bataaya
 Not only this, the spokesman of the People's Liberation Army said that the people of the Indian Army should learn from the history and stop making noise about the war in this way
 vaise yah bhi hakeekat he ki keval sena ke boote china ko bharat dhamka nahin saktaa
 Our military is not that strong compared to China
 tippaniyan Contrary to Army Chief General Rawat's statement last year, the then co-air Force Chief and now the current Air Force Chief, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanova, admitted that the Air Force lacked fighter jets and to fight with the Air Force in the face of war on two fronts Not enough resources

 sena pramukh general ravat ke bayaan se thik ulat pichley saal tatkaaleen sah vayusena pramukh or ab maujuuda vayusena pramukh air chif marshall bies dhanova ne mana tha ki vayusena ke paas ladaaku vimaanon kii kami he or do morchon par jang kii surat main vayusena ke paas ladane ke paryaapt sansaadhan nahin hai
 This difference in the statement of the Army and Air Force makes it clear that India still cannot compete with China easily
 haalanki, china to kya, yah baat har koi jaanata he ki ab ladaai kisi desh ke boote kii baat nahin he
 Yes, pressure can definitely be made on its name
 sachai yah he ki bharat, america or japan kii dosti china ko raas nahin aa rahi he, lihaaja vah dabaav banane ke liye yah sab kar rahaa he, taaki in teenon deshon kii dosti paravaan na chadh sake or is kshetra main uskaa dabadabaa kaayam rahe

 aaj tak ke salaam cricket kaarykram ke dauraan team india ke purv captain saurav ganguli ne visphotak salaami ballebaaj virendra sahvaag kii ballebaaji ke vishay main jo baaten bataayin use sunakar aapke bhi hosh ud jaaenge
 Ganguly said, "I could never play with the great opener Sunil Gavaskar but i can call Sehwag India's best opener because of his aggressive, strong and great ability to score runs
 jab se unhone khelnaa shuru kiya tab se aane vaale kai varshon tak mujhe nahin lagata ki unke jaisaa nirbhik ballebaaj maidan main dikhegaa
 Sourav Ganguly was asked what is the possibility of India in the World T20
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘team acchhee to jarur he lekin champion koun banegaa yah bolnaa aasaan nahin he
 "fours, sixes used to think of Viruj when he was told that Virender Sehwag has said that 99 per cent of India, Ganguly said," Viru's words are similar to his batting
 wo sirf chauke chakke or chakke kii sochate hai
 When he used to play cricket, if he was out and is sitting next to you, you are batting, then you used to listen to his commentary and think that cricket in the field is very easy
 udhar batting chal rahi he or idhar veeru bol rahe hai
 
 
 Four cuts will be scored
 kabhi kabhi aap uth kar chale jate the
 Saying that your cricket is different from mine, let me play my game
 aise cricketer hai veeru, isliye unhone kaha hoga ki 99 fisadi bharat hi jitegaa
 When inzamam-ul-haq was asked if Sehwag was at his peak during his captaincy, he said, "the first hour of the first day of the Test match is going on and i have put five fielders on the boundary
" mujhe khud apni captaini par shaq ho rahaa he
 When Sehwag stood on the wicket, it was very difficult to set the fielding for it
 main to yahaan tak kaha karata tha ki na to isaki apni izzat he or na hi ye kisi kii izzat karata he
 Was a very dangerous cricketer
 isaki quality ye thi ki hamaare khilaaf dabl centuri jadta tha
 Fielding and captaining his batting was a very difficult thing
 ’‘sahvaag se bada koi openar nahin’ganguli ne kaha, ‘maine kabhi gavaskar ko live nahin dekha lekin virendra sahvaag se bada openar bhartiya cricket main dekha nahin he
 Probably the next 10-15 years will not see such a batting opener
 ’ganguli ne match ke dauraan kii kuch baaten share kii
 He said, 'they had to tell you that Veeru should stop a little bit
 main kabhi unako ye kaha nahin ki veeru match jeetna he thodaa sa jaldi khel le
 He had to say that Veeru should stop for a bit
 
 
 or main vanade cricket main kahata tha
