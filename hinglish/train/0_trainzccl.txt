 The selection of the 'right' candidates for the direct contest between the BJP and the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections has been equally difficult for both parties
 lekin kisi ko andaja nahin tha ki tikat se vanchit rah gaye netaa or baagi itnaa mukhar virodh jataayenge
 The BJP was ahead of the Congress in releasing the list of candidates by announcing candidates for 176 of the total 230 seats
 lekin suchi aane ke saath hi sabase pehle purv mukhyamantri or das baar ke vidhayak babulal gaur ne bagawati tevar akhriyaar kar liya

 Eventually, the tickets of 51 mlas were cut and the seats of four mlas were changed

 bhaajapa ke baagi sanjay sharma (tendukheda), padma shukla (vijayraghogarh) or abhaya mishra (reva) or basapa chhodkar party main ai renu shah ko bhi tikat diya gaya he
 State NSUI President Vipin Wankhede and Youth Congress President Kunal Chaudhary have also been nominated from Agar and Kala Peepal respectively
 congress main bhaajapa kii tulana main bahut kam baagi hai
 However, the party is also risking the potential distaste of voters towards its candidates by re-electing most of the sitting mlas
 2013 main, congress ne apane 71 vidhayakon main se 62 ko phir se tikat diya tha par unamem se keval ve 17 vidhayak hi jeet sake the jo puraane diggaj maane jate hai
 The most notable among the Congress rebels is Nitin Trivedi, the son of veteran Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi

 supreme court ke faisle ne centre sarkaar ke kareeb 45 lakh karmchaariyon ko badi raahat di he
 If these services are not available in CGHS empaneled hospitals, even in out-of-hospital hospitals, they will get back the expenses if the serving or retired employees or their families get treatment

 lekin CGHS adhikariyon ne ilaaj main us vakt kharch hui 13 lakh 80 hazaar kii rakam riimbers karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Because these hospitals were not on the CGHS panel
 maamla adaalat or phir sabase badi adaalat main aayaa
 The court said that it is an injustice to not repay the entire amount if the expenditure is more than the CGHS fixed rates
 ye karmchaariyon ke behtareen ilaaj karaane ke adhikaron kaa bhi hanan he
 CGHS has to be paid and that too at the rate of that hospital
 court ne kaha ki jab ye sabit ho jaae kisarkaari karmchaarine kisi aspataal main ilaaj karaayaa he to phir pement koi nahin roak saktaa, na hi kam kar saktaa he
 The petitioner in 2003 when 13 in private hospitals
 80 lakh rupye kharch kar apana ilaaj kara liya to sarkaar kii kendriya sarkaar swasthya yojana ne bill bhugtan se saaf inkaar kar diya
 At that time it was said that the hospital was not on the panel

 The plan said that the basis of reimbursements should be based on the fix rate

 Article 370 of the constitution giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir has been rendered ineffective by the Modi government
 rajyasabha se paas hone ke baad mangalvaar ko grahamantri amit shah ne jammu-kashmir punargathan bill ko loksabhaa main charchaa ke liye rakhaa
 Manish Tiwari took the front on behalf of Congress while discussing this bill
 tiwari ne jammu-kashmir ke itihaas ko sangyaan lete hue bharat main vilay kii baat rakhi
 Congress MP Manish Tiwari said that in 1846 there was a fight with the British and Maharaja Dilip Singh and the treaty of Lahore
 iske alaava amritsar sandhi hui thi, jisamen vyas or sindhu dariyaa kaa ilaake maharaj gulab singh ne 75 lakh rupee main angrejon ko de di
 Tiwari said that the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir continued to operate from 1866 to 1947
 1947 main desh kii aazaadee ke baad 2 mulk bane ek bharat or doosraa pakistan
 After this there were 562 princely states, which had the freedom to go anywhere
 teen riyasaton ko lekar samvedansheel sthiti bani
 Among them were Jammu Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh
 mahatma gandhi tak ne maharaja hari singh se kashmir kaa vilay bharat main karne kii apil kii thi
 But Raja Hari Singh was confused about the merger with India
 aise hua bharat main kashmir kaa vilyacongress saasand ne kaha ki jammu-kashmir riyashat par isi bich pakistan ne hamalaa kar diya
 Maharaja Hari Singh sought help from India
 27 oktober 1947 ko maharaja hari singh ne vilay par dastakhat kiya
 The Indian Army then landed in the field to drive out the Pakistanis
 do saal tak ladaai jari rahi
 Therefore, the government that formed an integral part of Jammu and Kashmir in India was the government of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 'jammu-kashmir punargathan kaa faisla dhara 3 ke khilaaf'tiwari ne kaha ki jammu-kasmir kaa bharat ke saath vilay ke samay kuch qaraar hua tha
 Between 31 October 1951 and 17 November 1956, the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir made the constitution of the state
 isi ke baad jammu-kashmir ke vilay main anuchhed 370 or samvidhan shaamil he
 He said that history needs to be understood
 370 kaa matlab he ki rajya ke logon se salaah-mashvira kiya jaae
 But today there is no assembly
 dhara 3 ye nahin kahati he sansad kisi bhi rajya kii simaaen tay karne kaa faisla kare
 The decision to reorganize Jammu and Kashmir is against Section 3
 tiwari ne kaha 'ki bina sanvaidhanik sabha ke anuchhed 370 ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Today, when we are abolishing Article 370, what message are you giving to the states of Northeast India? kya aap kal assam, tripura or nagaland ke adhikaar bhi anuchhed 371 ko khatm kar denge
 a very big attack on the federal structure - Tiwari said that Jammu and Kashmir has a separate constitution which came into force on 26 January 1957, so what will happen to it
 kya sarkaar uske liye alag se vidheyak lekar aegi
 Tiwari said that this is the first time a state has been converted into a union territory
 yah sangheey dhaanche par bahut bada prahaar he
 If Junagadh, Hyderabad and Jammu and Kashmir are parts of India today, it is due to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 iske baad kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki manish tiwari ji ne yah bataaya hi nahin ki vah anuchhed 370 ke paksh main yaa khilaaf
 After this statement by the Home Minister, Tiwari stood again and said that if you remove the clause without the consent of the Constitutional Assembly, then it is totally wrong, hope you have understood

 ‚Äî taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)october 5, 2016 As such, the habit of sleeping in the afternoon is misunderstood for health
 lekin kam log hi jaanate hai ki dopaher main neend kii jhapai lene ke kuch phaayde bhi hote hai
 This has been confirmed in many studies
 uniwarsity of pennsylvania ke assistant professor ne dopaher main neend kii jhapai ko sehat ke liye phydemand bataaya he
 He said, 'it takes more work to work in the afternoon than sleeping
 mood fresh rahata he
 Researchers believe that this also strengthens immunity
 iske alaava dil se sambandhi beemaari hone kaa khatra bhi kam hota he
 'study: Girls in India feel insecure in public transport, however, sleeping in the afternoon can make you difficult to sleep at night
 isliye aapke liye ye jaananaa jaruri he ki din main kitne samay ke liye sona chahie
 - For how long, one can take a 15 to 30 minute nap during sleep time
 agar iske baad bhi aapako neend aae to behatar hoga ki puure 90 minute kii neend len
 Because lack of sleep can make you feel more tired and headache
 lekin 90 minute kii neend lene se aapako thakaan kaa ehsaas nahin hoga or aap apane kaam ko behatar tareeke se kar sakenge
 Workouts and sleepwalkers believe that they should avoid sleeping immediately after a workout
 eksrasij karne ke kam se kam 2 ghante baad hi soen
 If you have a habit of sleeping during the day, then decide a time to sleep
 saavdhaan, selfi kaa shauk de saktaa he kai bimariyon ko dastak- sabhi ke liye din main neend kii jhapai lenaa jaruri nahin hedgar aapako din main neend nahin aati he to din main sone se bachein
 a study report has confirmed that about 50 percent people do not get much benefit from sleeping in the afternoon
 in logon main sarkadian ridam hota he
 The circadian rhythm tells the body when to sleep, when to get up
 agar aapako din ke samay main neend nahin aati he to isse ye pataa chalata he ki aapke sharir ko aaraam kii jarurat nahin he

 Many judges have been separated so far from hearing the case of the whistleblower officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi who shook the political and administrative corridors by revealing several scams in AIIMS from Haryana to Delhi
 taaja maamla cat chairman justise el narsimhan reddy kaa he
 Although Justice Reddy has revealed the reasons behind the separation from the case, the order of the other judges does not clearly indicate the reasons for which he distanced himself from hearing the case
 sanjeev chaturvedi se jude alag-alag mukademon main ab tak supreme court, hai court se lekar sijeem str ke jaj apane ko alag kar chuke hai
 Justice L
 Narasimhan Reddy, chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), in his order issued on March 29, said that he recused himself from hearing four pending cases of Chaturvedi
 aadesh main unhone kaha he ki yah ek bahut hi durlabh prakaran he, jisamen bahut hi durbhagyapurna ghatnaayen ghat raheen thim
 Due to which the prestige of the post of chairman was at stake
 in halaat ke kaaran aavashyak ho gaya tha ki vaadi is nyaayalay ke sthaan par kisi anya nyaayalay main apane cese kii sunwaayee ke liye vaad daayar kare
 Along with this, Justice Reddy also ordered through the Registrar that the file related to his petitions be returned to the plaintiff, so that he can file the suit in any other competent court as per law
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is tarah kaa aadesh shaayad pehali baar diya gaya ho, jab jaj ne cese kii file tak vaadi ko lautaane ke aadesh jari kar die hai
 It is being told that the case started with Justice Reddy's order in July 2018, in which he postponed the hearing of Sanjeev Chaturvedi in the Nainital CAT in the ACR case for six weeks
 us samay chaturvedi ko centre sarkaar ne prashikshan ke liye finland bheja gaya tha
 This order was challenged by the Chaturvedi in the Uttarakhand High Court, on which the High Court also imposed a fine of 25 thousand, stating the attitude of the Center and AIIMS as a prima facie avenger
 hai court ne yah bhi spasht aadesh diya ki sanjeev chaturvedi ke asiaar ke maamle kii sunwaayee nainital cat main hi hogi
 This decision was challenged in the challenge by AIIMS, which upheld the High Court's decision and imposed a fine of 25 thousand
 is bich justise reddy ne 29 march ko is maamle se khud ko alag karne kaa faisla kar liya
 Sources reveal that this is not the first case when a judge has disassociated himself from hearing the sensitive case of Sanjeev Chaturvedi, who has become the eyes of the governments due to disclosure of corruption cases in both the Congress and BJP governments

 The result was that despite BJP being in majority, both BJP and Congress parties got 30‚Äì30 votes
 aise halaat main lottery nikaali gai, jisamen pehle to baagi surendra singh ko meyar ghoshit kar diya
 But then one vote was repealed and the votes were counted again and the BJP candidate was finally declared the mayor

 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in Parliament on August 17 has exposed the fact that 57 coal mines were distributed to private companies in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner
 isamen nilaamee kii tarah paardarshee dhang se boli lagane kii prakriya kaa paalan karne kii koyala mantralay kii salaah kii andekhi kii gai or jab aavanton kiye gaye, us dauraan zyaadaatar samay koyala mantralay khud manmohan singh ke hi paas tha
 This is not the case
 unki aguai vaale pradhanmantri karyaalay ne captive mining ke liye koyala blokon ke aavanton main pratispardhi boli shuru karne ke har prayaas ko lagaataar naakaam kiya tha
 The CAG states that the Ministry of Coal's refusal to adopt the mode of auction 1
 86 lakh karod ru
 Has suffered
 isse labhanvit hone waalon main jeespel, tata steel, tata power, tata spoj, jeesdblue steel limited, essar power janareshan, adani power or jindal steel and power limited shaamil hai
 The report says that ironically, only one of these blocks - Electrosteel Castings Limited of Jharkhand - has been commissioned so far
 mukhya satarkta ayukta ne sibiai ko nirdesh diya ki khadaanon ke aavanton main aniyamittaaon kii jaanch karke report 1 sitambar tak pesh kare
 It is likely that CBI will ask for some more time
 is report ne zyaadaatar vipakshi partiyon ko ek saath laa diya he
 non-nda parties like the Left, Biju Janata Dal and Anna DMK have also joined the BJP and its allies
 vipaksh ne pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang kii he
 The government has refused to accept the demand and overall the CAG report has eclipsed the functioning of Parliament
 haalanki ummid he ki masale kaa der-saver koi hal nikal aayega
 Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha says, "we are not demanding Manmohan Singh's resignation because he was the Prime Minister, but rather the minister in charge of coal has remained the same for the entire period in which the coal blocks were allocated
" prakriya niyamon ke anusaar prayek aavanton par prabharee mantri ke taur par unke hastakshar kiye gaye honge
 So if someone is responsible, he is the Prime Minister himself
 ''may, 2004 main manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lee thi
 The CAG has recorded in its report that 193 coal mines were allocated since 2003-04
 pradhanmantri ke taur par manmohan ke kaarykaal main 142 koyala khadaanen vibhinn sarkari or nijee companiyon ko aavantit kii gai thim
 The CAG focused on those blocks assigned to private companies, keeping government firms out of the scope of the audit
 lekha pareekshak ne bhumigat khadaanon ko bhi jaanch ke daayre se baahar kar diya
 He eventually focused his attention on only 57 (open cast and mixed) blocks
 inhen captive mining ke liye nijee companiyon ko ek aisi prakriya ke jariye saunpa gaya tha, jisamen 'paardarshita or nishpakshta' kaa abhaav tha
 Interestingly, the Prime Minister's name has not been taken at any point in the report
 lekin november, 2006 se may, 2009 ke bich koyala mantralay khud manmohan singh sambhaal rahe the
 The PMO, headed by Manmohan Singh, is also accused that the Coal Ministry had tried to adopt a transparent bid by issuing a flat administrative order, thereby eliminating the possibility of arbitrariness in the allocation of coal mines, but the PMO Struggled in efforts
 piemo ne khanan mantralay ko mins and minerals (vikaas or niyaman) adhinium, 1957 main sanshodhan karne kaa nirdesh diya, jo jarurat se zyada lambii khinchne vaali prakriya sabit hui
 The MMDR (amendment) Bill was introduced in Parliament on 17 October 2008
 sansad ne ise agast, 2010 main paarit kar diya tha, lekin sarkaar ne aavanton niti main parivartan kii adhisuchana is saal 2 farvari ko jari kii
 Meanwhile, the allocation of coal blocks continued first on the recommendations of the Screening Committee and later on the recommendations of the Committee of Experts (ECC) on coal
 sieji kii report kahati he, ''baatcheet ke records ke minutes yaa anya dastavejon main aisa kuch nahin tha, jisase sanket miltaa ho ki khadaanon ke aavanton ke liye aavedakon kaa tulanaatmak moolyankan kiya gaya ho, jise screening cameti ne manjuur kiya ho
 On what basis should coal blocks be allocated? The idea of a competitive bid for this was first mooted in a meeting of all the parties related to the matter chaired by the Secretary of Coal on June 28, 2004
 tatkaaleen koyala sachiv pi
 C
 parakh ne 16 july, 2004 ko koyala or khan rajyamantri dasari narayan raav ko ek vistrut note pesh kiya, jisamen tark diya gaya tha ki ''
 
 
 Since there is a huge difference in the price of coal supplied by Coal India Limited and the coal produced by competitive mining, it gets an unexpected advantage, which is allocated to the captive block
 
 
 
 "in such circumstances, the Ministry of Coal considered the auction of coal blocks the best way, as it was 'transparent and purposeful'"
 manmohan singh ne pratispardhi boli ke koyala mantralay ke prayaason kii raah main lagaataar rode daale
 How was it done? See: September 11, 2004 The PMO drafted a note, highlighting the drawbacks of the auction method
 rajya mantri dasari narayan raav ne vishesh taur par yah darj karaayaa ki pratispardhi boli ke prastaav par aage nahin badha ja saktaa, ''kyonki isse koyala khadaanon ke aavanton main or deree hogi, kyonki vanidgiyak uddeshyon ke liye koyala blokon ke aavanton ke liye pratispardhi boli kii chayan prakriya apnaane vaala koyala khadaan (rashtriyakaran) sanshodhan vidheyak, 2000 rajyasabha main lambit he
 In October 2004, the PMO reiterated its opposition to the policy of allocation of coal blocks through competitive bidding
 yah baat koyala sachiv ke note se spasht hoti he, jisamen kaha gaya he, ''
 
 
 The policy was discussed in the Prime Minister's Office and it was felt that since a large number of applicants have requested (for) allocation of coal blocks based on the existing policy, it is not appropriate to change the existing policy to competitive bidding
 Will happen
 ''7 april, 2006 vibhinn saajhedaar mantralayon ke pratinidhiyon ke saath ek baithak ke baad piemo ne khanan mantralay ko nirdesh diya ki mmdiar adhinium, 1957 main sanshodhan kiya jaae taaki pratispardhi boli kaa vistaar sabhi khanijon ke sandarbh main kiya ja sake
 An administrative order implementing competitive bidding could have accelerated the process, but Manmohan's PMO had a different intent
 28 july, 2006 ko kanoon vibhaag ne koyala mantralay ko bheji apni raay main yah faisla sarkaar par chhod diya ki vah pratispardhi boli ko apnaane ke liye chaahe to prashasnic aadesh jari karne kaa aasaan or tej tarika akhriyaar kare yaa vaidhanik rasta apana le
 It is now known that the PMO adopted the method of amending the MMDR Act
 july, 2006 vidhi vibhaag kii salaah ke anusaar pratispardhi boli shuru kii ja sakati thi
 But the Coal Ministry, under the pmo's directive, ignored this advice and continued the arbitrary allocation
 17 aktubar, 2008 kanoon main parivartan ke liye vidheyak sansad main pesh kiya gaya or ek lambey or pechide raste se guzarakar agast, 2010 main sansad dwaara ise paarit kar diya gaya
 But this amendment was notified after two years, the reason for which is beyond comprehension
 sieji kii report par sansad ke donon sadanon main charchaa karaane or saath hi lok lekha samiti (piesi) ke paas punarikshan ke liye bheje jane kii sarkaar kii peshkash ko vipaksh ne khaarij kar diya he
 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari argues, "why is the opposition running away from the debate in Parliament?" If you argue, the facts will come out
 report kii jaanch piesi dwaara kii jaani chahie
 "the Opposition has been demanding the Prime Minister's resignation since day one," says Rajiv Shukla, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs
 yah nahin chal saktaa
 "we know that the CAG report is presented first in Parliament and then in the PAC," Sinha replies
 nishchit rup se aapako tu ji ghotaale par sieji kii report ke hashr kaa bhi andaja hoga? piesi ne sieji kii report kaa adhyayan karne or saboot jutaney main ek saal bitaa diya he, or jab report sweekaar kiye jane ke liye taiyaar ho gai thi, tab congress ke sadasyon ne use tahas-nahas kar diya
 There is no scope for presenting it in Parliament

 si
 Parikh recommends the Minister of State for Coal and Mining, Dasari Narayan Rao, to adopt a competitive bidding approach
 19 farvari, 2009sthaayee cameti vidheyak ko manjuuri de detii he
 As of September 2009, 142 blocks have already been allocated, of which 57 have been given to private companies
 agast, 2010vidheyak sansad se paarit hota he
 September 11, 2004, the Prime Minister's Office issues a note, highlighting the drawbacks of competitive bidding
 inamen sabase pramukh he captive mining ke liye block aavanton main deree kaa mudda
 October 31, 2008 The MMDR Bill is referred to the Standing Committee
 2 farvari , 2012mmdiar adhinium main sanshodhan adhishuchet kiye jate hai
 Now the allocation to private companies is done through auction
 lekin manamaane dhang se aavanton ko rokane ke liye adhyadesh jari karke aisa pehle bhi kiya ja saktaa tha
 November 1, 2004 To allow competitive bidding, changes in the Coal Mines (nationalization) Act, 1973 are necessary, but the Prime Minister's Office opposes the amendment
 17 aktubar, 2008mmdiar adhinium, 1957 main sanshodhan karne ke liye sansad main vidheyak pesh kiya jaataa he
 July 25, 2005 The PMO decides that the coal mines will be allocated by the Screening Committee, as amending the Coal Mines Act will take time
 15 sitambar, 2006koyala mantralay piemo ko suchit karata he ki kanoon mantralay ne mmdiar adhinium main sanshodhan kii salaah di he, taaki pratispardhi boli kii anumati di ja sake

 com / Scobdiqk7l Anushka Sharma was spotted at Mumbai Airport two days ago
 jahaan vah apane pita ajay sharma, maa ashima or bade bhai karnesh ke saath nikaleen
 At the same time, Virat Kohli's family and close friends had also booked tickets for the Italian city of Milan
 iske saath hi donon kii shaadi kii atakalein tej ho gayi thi
 Significantly, Virat and Anushka's marriage has been discussed for a long time
 viraat jab bhi cricket se chuttee lete the to shaadi kii hawa garm ho jaati thi
 This time also Virat Kohli is on leave and this is what happened
 yun to log maanate hai ki holi par rang khilne kii shuruyaat jhaansi ke erch main hui thi lekin ajab baat yah he ki is tyohaar ko hi yahaan ke log shubh nahin maanate
 It is said that the decree of the British arrived in Jhansi on the day of Holi that they do not consider Laxmibai's son Damodar Rao as their successor
 is farmaan se naaraaz jhaansi kii rani or vahaan kii janata ne holi nahin manaai thi
 Even today, people live in Jhansi who celebrate this festival, not the day of Holi, but the next day
 angrajon ne bheja tha tughluqi farmaan
 
 
 It may be known that after the death of King Gangadhar Rao of Jhansi on November 21, 1853, the command of the kingdom came into the hands of Rani Laxmibai
 gangadhar raav ne unki mrityu se pehle hi ek balak (damodar raav) ko god lekar apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya tha
 The British refused to accept the transfer of this power
 jis din jhaansi main yah farmaan jari kiya gaya, vahaholika hi din tha
 Om Shankar 'asar' is mentioned in the book
 
 
 om shankar 'asar' naamak lekhak ne un dinon ek kitaab likhi thi
 The name of this book is 'maharani Laxmibai and her Jhansi'
 is farmaan ke tahat dalhousie ne letters likhaa tha - bharat sarkaar kii 7 march 1854 kii ajna ke anusaar jhaansi kaa rajya british ilaake main milaayaa jaataa he
 Through this advertisement, all the people are informed that the rule of Jhansi state is done under Major Ellis, the people of the state should consider themselves under the British Government and 'tax' Major Ellis to live with happiness, peace and satisfaction
 Take care
 khushi gam main badal gai
 
 
 According to the history recorded in Jhansi Gazetteer, this unfortunate incident happened on the day of Holi
 holi ke jashn kii taiyaariyaan jari thim
 Meanwhile, the Tughlaq decree of the British was pronounced
 log shok main dub gaye or holi nahin manaai gai
 The queen left the fort and went to another palace
 isi gam main aaj bhi jhaansi ke kai logaholi ke din holinhin manaate
 Instead they play color the next day

 ‚Äòmistar cricketer‚Äô maaikel hasi ko ipel kii apni team chennai superkings ke captain mahendra singh dhoni or madhyakram ke ballebaaj suresh raina ke saath ballebaaji karne main anand aata he, kyonki in donon ke teji se ran banane ke kaushal se un par se bhi dabaav hatataa he
 Hussey shared a 60-run second wicket partnership with Raina and a 74-run third wicket with Dhoni during Chennai's 86-run win over Delhi Daredevils here last night
 is australian ballebaaj ne match ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, dhoni jaise khilaadi ke saath ballebaaji karnaa acha lagata he, jo ki beparwaah andaaj main ballebaaji karke teji se ran banaata he
 He said, Suresh Raina is the second player who does so
 ye ballebaaj aap par se dabaav hataate hai
 With this, you can score runs from the other end only by hitting the ball at empty places
 in donon ke saath saajhedaari se nischitator par madad milti he
 The comments hasi ne naabad 65 ran kii pari kheli
 When asked if he could consider a return to international cricket, given his hunger for runs, he smiled and said, "no, i am definitely happy with my decision
" antarrashtriya cricket kii jindagi kaaphi kathin hoti he
 You stay out for 10‚Äì11 months in a year
 isliye meraa faisla keval cricket se sambadhit nahin tha
 i have young children and this was the main reason for my retirement
 hasi ne match ke bare main kaha ki yahaan 150 ran kaa score acha hota, kyonki firozshah kotla kii pich par ballebaaji karnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Chennai had added 109 runs in the last ten overs to score 169 for four wickets
 unhone kaha, nai gend thodaa neeche rah rahi thi
 It was my and Murali Vijay's responsibility to assess the situation correctly
 iske baad ham kah sakate the ki acha score kya hoga or mere hisaab se 150 ran acha score hota
 i told this to (coach) Stephen Fleming during a timeout in between
 dhoni kii bade shot khilne kii kshamta ke kaaran ham 20 ran adhik banane main safal rahe
 Hussey, however, said that his team needs to perform consistently well
 unhone kaha, hamane bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 The win against Kings XI (punjab) was also good, but it is important for us to maintain consistency
 hamen aage bhi kadi mehnat kerani hogi

 hamen aage bhi kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 Hussey scored an unbeaten 65 runs
 jab unase poocha gaya ki unki ranon kii bhukh ko dekhte hue kya vah antarrashtriya cricket main vaapasi par vichaar kar sakate hai, unhone muskaraate hue kaha, nahin main nischitator par apane faisle se khush hum
 The life of international cricket is very difficult
 aap saal main 10-11 maheene tak baahar rahete ho
 So my decision was not only related to cricket
 mere chote bachche hai or mere sanyas lene kii mukhya vajah yahi thi
 Hussey said about the match that the score of 150 here would have been good, because it was not easy to bat on the pitch of Ferozeshah Kotla
 chennai ne aakhri das overon main 109 ran jodakar chaar wicket par 169 ran banaae the
 He said, the new ball was staying slightly down
 sthiti kaa sahi akalan karnaa meri or murali vijay kii jimmedaari thi
 After that we could say what would be a good score and i think 150 would have been a good score
 bich main time out ke dauraan maine (coach) stephen fleming se yah baat kahi thi
 We were able to score 20 runs more because of Dhoni's ability to play big shots
 hasi ne haalanki kaha ki unki team ko lagaataar acha pradarshan karne kii jarurat he
 He said, we did very well
 kings ilevan (punjab) ke khilaaf jeet bhi kaaphi acchhee thi, lekin hamaare liye nirantarata banaae rakhana jaruri he
 We will have to work even harder
 dhoni kii bade shot khilne kii kshamta ke kaaran ham 20 ran adhik banane main safal rahe
 Hussey, however, said that his team needs to perform consistently well
 unhone kaha, hamane bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 The win against Kings XI (punjab) was also good, but it is important for us to maintain consistency

 Today is the birthday of former Team India opener Shiv Sundar Das
 odisha kii rajdhani bhubaneshwar main janmen das aajkal purvi kshetra ke coach hai
 Shiv Sundar Das's contribution in international career remained as a Test player
 wo vanade main kuch khaas nahin kar sake
 However, he only got a chance to play in four odis and in this he scored 39 runs at an average of 13
 das test ke achche openar ke taur par ubhare the
 Right-handed batsman Shiv Sundar Das touched the 1000-run mark on 15 December 2001, exactly one year after playing his first innings in Test cricket on 10 November 2010
 iske liye unhone 15 test kii 28 paariyaan kheli
 Despite consistently performing well for a year when he failed to tour the West Indies and 15 in eight innings of five Tests
 5 kii ausat se mahaj 124 ran bana sake to unhen dobaaraa team main nahin chunaa gaya
 Shiv Sundar Das played a total of 23 Test matches for India
 is dauraan unhone 34
 He scored 1326 runs including two centuries and 9 fifties at an average of 89
 bade players kii maujuudagi main bane best playerbat 2000-2001 ke zimbabwe daure kii he
 Then there were batsmen like Sachin, Ganguly, Dravid and Laxman in the team
 bulaavyo test main zimbabwe ne pehali pari main 173 ran banaae iske jawaab main bhartiya team ne 318 ran banaae
 But when Zimbabwe came out to play the third innings, it scored 328 runs
 jeet ke liye bharat ko 184 ranon kii jarurat thi
 In such a situation, it was necessary for the openers to play on the wicket
 pehali pari main 30 ran banane vaale shiv sundar das ne iskaa daaromadar liya or out hue bagaiyr 82 ran banaae
 He was voted Man of the Match for his performance
 shiv sundar das ne test main apni do shatkeey pari zimbabwe ke khilaaf khelin
 India played two Tests on the Zimbabwe tour in 2001
 inaki chaar pariyon main das kaa score rahaa 30, 82 (note out), 57 or 70 or unhen pehle match main ‚Äòmain of da match‚Äô ke baad ‚Äòmain of da siries‚Äô chunaa gaya
 Das's international career at Dus Hazari Club ended in 2002, but he continued to play domestic cricket
 cricket se sanyas lene se pehle tak das 2010 tak odisha kii ore se or phir vidarbha ke liye wo 2012 tak ranjai trophy maichon main khele
 During this time he scored 10908 runs and joined the ten Hazari club of domestic cricket
 24 shatak ke saath yahaan unki sarvshereshth pari 300 ran note out rahi
 For many years he kept beheading people
 or phir sirkati laash sidhe le jaakar tihaad jail ke baahar phenk aata tha
 With the challenge that if you can catch it, catch it
 phir ek rose wo pakadaa gaya
 But it was also surprisingly missed
 uske chhutate hi tihaad jail ke baahar sir kati laash milane kaa silsilaa ek baar phir shuru ho gaya tha
 The first corpse found in 1998 is 1998 when a corpse was found near Tihar Jail for the first time
 uske baad jail ke aasapaas achaanak sir kati laashen milane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya tha
 The police was also upset by this
 koi tha jo har katl ke baad bagaiyr sir ke laash ko jaakar tihaad jail ke paas phenk aata tha
 When the matter was about the murder, the police became cautious
 dilli police ab kaatil kii talash main jute gai thi
 This sequence of the murder of Sunny from Lashinkhun was started in this way from Adarsh nagar area of delhi
 jahaan 1998 main pehali sir kati laash mili thi
 Second head cut body in Alipur on 27 June 2003, third head cut body in front of Gate No 1 of Tihar Jail on 20 November 2003, Fourth head cut body in Mangolpuri on 2 November 2005, Fifth head cut body in Gate of Tihar Jail on 20 October 2006 In front of Number-3, the sixth Sircati corpse was recovered on 25 April 2007 in front of Gate No-3 of Tihar Jail and the seventh Sirakti corpse again on 18 May 2007 in front of Gate No-3 of Tihar
 police ke liye yah ek badi chunauti thi
 The murderer was in front, but not proof
 One of the vicious murderers in front of the police was Chandrakant Jha
 kamaal ye tha ki pehle hi katl ke baad police ne chandrakant jha ko giraftaar bhi kar liya tha
 But he was acquitted for lack of evidence
 or uske baad katl kaa silsilaa ek baar phir shuru ho gaya
 The process of finding dead bodies outside Tihar Jail was not ending
 dilli police ke saamne qaatil kaa cheharaa to tha lekin uske paas saboot nahin the jo ye sabit kar pate ki chandrakant hi in sirkati laashon kaa gunahagaar he
 ALSO READ: The fifth dead corpse was thrown on October 20, 2006 in front of Gate No 3 of Tihar Jail after the first mistake of the most wanted terrorist Maulana Masood Azhar's bloody dastankatil
 isi din qaatil ne pehali galati kii thi
 Actually, he had left a letter for the first time with this corpse
 jisamen sidhe police ko chunauti di gai thi ki pakad sako to pakad ke dikhaao
 The challenge was given in the letter, "my dear ones, from your son-in-law DHG, ie Delhi Home Guard to IPS officer, there is an open challenge on behalf of your son-in-law that if you really have drunk mother's milk then show me
 Otherwise, you will be called illegitimate children from all the top to bottom Delhi Police Staff
 '' khat kaa mazamoon hi aisa tha ki serial killer kii is chitthee se puure mahakme main hadakamp much gaya
 Eventually the police ran all their horses and then Chandrakant Jha was arrested
 lekin jald hi chandrakant jha ek baar phir sabooton kii kami ke chalate zamaanat par reeha ho gaya tha
 In the absence of evidence, the acquittal, Katilpolis, arrested Chandrakant only after the first murder
 police ko yakeen bhi tha ki hatyara yahi he
 This belief was yet to be confirmed
 lihaaza police ne chandrakant ko gunahagaar sabit karne ke liye uske khilaaf saboot ikaithe karne shuru kiye
 In the Shekhar murder case, the police produced many evidence and witnesses in the court to convict Chandrakant
 lekin uski tamaam daleelein naakaam sabit huin
 The court acquitted Jha for lack of evidence
 umesh murder cese main bhi chandrakant ke khilaaf police ke paas koi subut nahin tha
 Therefore, in this case also, Chandrakant was acquitted by the court
 aise hi mongolpuri murder cese main subut ke abhaav main majabuuran adaalat ne chandrakant bari kar diya tha
 The first evidence against the murderer was found near Dilip Mandal, the seventh and last corpse found near Gate number 3 of Tihar
 is cese main chandrakant kii giraftaar ke baad uski nishandehi par laash kaa sir bhi yamuna ke kinare se baraamad kar liya gaya tha
 That is, after acquitting three of the seven slaughtered, now for the first time any strong evidence was leveled against the police by Chandrakant
 lekin abhi bhi tafteesh or saboot adhure the
 Read here: a creepy Dastanpolis of wife and parents murdered was a witness to negligence
 naa pukhta saboot
 Nor any eyewitness
 aise main sawaal yahi tha ki kya dilli police court main chandrakant jha ko dilli kaa serial killer kaise sabit karegi
 It was not that the police did not get the opportunity or evidence to surround Chandrakant
 par vakt rahete police unka sahi dhang se istemaal nahin kar saki
 For example, after arresting Chandrakant Jha, the police took his confessional statement but did not make his statement before the magistrate
 jabaki court main iqbaalia bayaan kii koi ahmiyat nahin hoti
 The court gives legal recognition to the statement of 164 given before the magistrate
 ek sirkati laash ke saath mili khat ko police ne bina sil kiye hi chandrakant kii likhaawat ke saath milan ke liye lab bhej diya tha
 This was the biggest negligence of the police
 kyonki ye khat is cese main shaayad sabase ahm saboot sabit hota
 And it happened later
 aise sabit hua tha jurmji haa, chandrakant ke khilaaf sabase bada saboot aakhir main wo khat hi bana, jo usne dilli police ko likhaa tha
 The handwriting of the letter and the handwriting of Chandrakant were one
 forensik report ne bhi isaki tasadeeq kar di thi
 Based on this handwriting, the court ultimately held Chandrakant guilty
 likhaawat ke alaava isi khat se doosraa sabase ahm suraag bhi police ko mila
 In fact, Chandrakant had also written in the letter that he had got out of jail in 2003
 ricard se pataa chalaa ki wo sachmuch 2003 main tihaad se jamaanat par reeha hua tha
 After throwing the body of a young man named Amit in front of Tihar, Chandrakant himself called the police at Harinagar police station
 or chunauti di thi ki use pakad sako to pakad lo
 The PCO owner from whom Chandrakant had called the police identified the Chandrakant in the court
 iske alaava police ko chandrakant ke haidarpur sthit makaan number 229 main khun se sanaa ek chaaku bhi baraamad hua tha
 The blood was matched to the corpse of a man named Dilip who was killed at his hands
 isliye chandrakant ne kiye the katlpulice ne chandrakant jha ko giraftaar to kar liya tha
 During the interrogation, when the reality of killing came to the police, the police were also surprised
 kaatil ne police katl karne kii vajab bataate hue police se kaha ki 'use uske karmon kii sajaa mil gai he
 'the reason given by the police in this charge sheet for this dreadful serial killing is really shocking
 vajah yah thi ki chandrakant jha kaaphi gussell kism kaa shaks tha
 Suddenly, if a friend or a friend was passing a thing, he used to kill him and to remove the identity of the corpse, he was beheaded
 masalan kisi ke chaalachalan par shaq hone par, yaa ek dost ke machhlee khaakar bartan baahar naa rakhane par, bina uske bataae uskaa rickshaw lene or usame pankchar karke waapas dene par yaa phir uskaa mobile chori karne par usne logon kaa katl kar diya tha
 Two convicts were found together
 The police had filed a charge sheet against him in the lower court on 24 August 2007 after his arrest
 pehali chargeshit main us par chah logon ke katl kaa iljaam tha
 On 26 August 2007, the police filed a second charge sheet against him
 jisamen us par saatven katl kaa iljaam laga
 But on 5 December 2007, the court acquitted Chandrakant Jha in a murder case for lack of evidence
 wo jamaanat par baahar aa gaya tha
 But then on 21 March 2008, the court prima facie convicted him of serial murder and allowed him to stand trial
 2013 main use ek saath faansee or umr kaid kii sajaa sunai gai
 But then three years later, on 27 January 2015, Delhi High Court changed the death sentence of Chandrakant Jha to life imprisonment
 chhattisgarh ke ashaant bastar kshetra ke junglee ilaake main naksaliyon ne ek barudi surang nirodhak vaahan ko bam se uda diya, jisase kendriya rigerv police bal (siarpief) ke ek jawan ghatnasthal par hi shahid ho gaya or anya paanch ghayal ho gaye

 The fear is that if the law becomes a toy of every hand, then the police, the court and justice will become just words

 Former Karnataka Lokayukta and Team Anna member Justice n Santosh Hegde has raised doubts about the success of his former ally Arvind Kejriwal's new party
 arvind kejariwal kii navgathit ‚Äòaam aadmi party‚Äô ke bare me puche gayi sawaal par ucchtam nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish ne kaha, ‚Äòmeri ashanka sirf yah he ki aaj kal ke maahaul main raajnneetik vyavastha kii itani maangon ke kaaran koi raajnneetik dal kaise khud ko barkaraar rakh paaegaa
 From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, a huge amount of money is required to elect around 546 members of Parliament
 yah koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 Hegde said, "it's a good thing theoretically, but can it really be successful?" ‚Äô unhone yah bhi kaha ki pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane main kuch bhi galat nahin he kyonki vah bhi anya lok sevakon kii tarah hai
 Hegde said, 'what is wrong with the Prime Minister being in the ambit of Lokpal? Is the Prime Minister not a public servant? Are there no corruption cases against Prime Ministers in other countries? a prime minister is prosecuted in Japan every other year
 (purv america raashtrapati richard) nicksan par mukadmaa chalaa
 What is so great about the Prime Minister? ‚Äùhegde said that in the past, there have been allegations of corruption against Indian Prime Ministers and only the President and Governors are exempt from prosecution, not the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòhamane boforce or jeemem rishwatakhori maamle main do purv pradhanmantriyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope dekhe the
 In democracy, how can a person be exempted from prosecution simply because he is in a position? The constitution exempts the president and governors from prosecution in certain cases
 kisi aise vyakti par yah siddhant lagu nahin ho saktaa jo niyamit aadhaar par kaaryakari aadesh jari karte hon

 Bhimrao Ambedkar started trying to make a place in the Dalit politics of Uttar Pradesh by securing the support of General President Lalji Prasad Nirmal
 mayawati ko pataa he ki upi main zyada se zyada siten jeetne kaa rasta yahaan kii 17 surakshit siton se hokar gujarata he
 So other parties are also making strategies to grab them
 isi ke tahat dalit vot bank ko saadhane main sabhi partiyon ne edi-chotii kaa jor laga diya he
 According to the population, Dalits have more than 21 percent of the population in the country's largest state UP
 yahaan kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 17 bhale anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit hon, lekin takreeban 40 pratishat siten aisi hai, jahaan inaki aabaadi 25 pratishat se zyada he
 In such a situation, the strategy of political parties on safe seats is to connect other non-dalit castes with their Dalit candidate
 dalit chintak or elahabaad sthit govind vallabh pant soshal science institute ke pro
 Badri Narayan says, "out of the 66 sub-castes of the Dalits, only half a dozen are getting a place on the political platform

 On April 14, on May 14, on social engineering, Ambedkar Jayanti in the reserved seats, Mayawati abruptly called for a press conference at her residence at Mall Avenue in Lucknow at three in the afternoon
 is maukey par mayawati ne na sirf bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par hamalaa bolaa balki bispi ke gathan se lekar ab tak daliton ke liye kiye kaam bhi gina daale
 His gesture was clear
 upi main dalit voton par kisi kii bhi najar mayawati ko bardaasht nahin he
 During the last 20 years, only in the 1999 and 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP won 5-5 reserved seats
 pichley chunaav main yah ghatakar do par aa gayi
 In the hope of better performance in this Lok Sabha election, Mayawati has created social engineering on Dalit seats

 The party has fielded jatav-charmacar caste candidates in 9 seats and fielded candidates in six seats
 bispi ke vidhanmandal dal ke netaa or pradesh pravaktaa swami prasad maury kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äò2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party 17 surakshit siton main se 13 par duusare sthaan par thi or haar kaa antar bhi bahut kam tha
 This time the public is remembering the rule of BSP due to the atrocities on Dalits along with all sections of society in SP government
 yah is chunaav main spasht ho jayega
 "the challenge of repeating the previous performance: The biggest challenge before the SP, which has been opposing reservation in promotion in government jobs, has been to repeat its previous performance
" pichhali baar party ne 17 surakshit siton main se 10 par apana paracham laharaaya tha
 Earlier this year, to remove the resentment among the Dalits, the SP government started the recruitment process for long-vacant posts of scheduled castes and tribes in the state

 ‚Äô‚Äô jatav-charmkaar jatiyon main bispi kii pakad ko dekhte hue sapa ne inaki kaat ke liye duusari jatiyon par bharosa jataayaa he
 The party has fielded Jatav-tanners in only two seats
 sabase zyada saat siton par paasi netaaon ko tikat dene ke alaava sthaneey samikarnon par kabja jamaane ke liye dhanuk or valmiki jati ko bhi chunavi ran main jagah di gai he
 All are busy trying to convince the Dalits, for the success of Modi, BJP also needs the support of Dalits along with backward, extreme and backward
 yah dalit vot bank kaa hi jaadu tha, jab 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 14 surakshit siton par camel khilaa tha
 But after this, the party continued to drift away from the Dalits, whose effect was also reflected in the election results
 bijepi anusuchit jati morche ke purv adhyaksh ramanaresh ravat kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòmayawati ko samarthan dene ke baad se party se jude dalit chhitakkar bispi kii ore chale gaye the

" party ne ab loksabhaa chunaav main upi main daliton kaa samarthan batorne kii bhi ummid lagaai he
 In order to garner the support of the pro-kanshi Ram Dalits, who were angry with Mayawati in the state, the BJP began to hang a portrait of Kanshi Ram in the central office
 15 janvari ko bijepi anusuchit jati morche ke prabharee sanjay paswan ne punjab main kanshiram ke gaanv jaakar party kii sarkaar banane par unhen maranoparant bharat ratna dene kaa vaada kiya
 a subsidiary organization of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is introducing Ambedkar, Jagjivan Ram and Kanshi Ram as Dalit icons by placing chaupals in Seva Bharati villages
 is tarah paroksh rup se bijepi ke paksh main dalit voton ko lamaband karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The party has associated with the Indian President of the National Justice Party and Uditraj, who is a stalwart among employed Dalit officers and employees, to convince Dalits angry with the party on the issue of reservation in promotion

 ‚Äô‚Äô rahul ne bispi ke sansthaapak sadsy balihaari babu ko lalganj surakshit seat se chunaav main utaara he
 At the same time, Dalit leader Raj Bahadur, who was an associate of Kanshi Ram, has been given the responsibility to increase the penetration of the party among the Dalits
 balihaari babu kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòmayawati kii nitiyon se dalit tabaka pareshaan he or ab vah congress ko vikalp ke rup main dekh rahaa he

 India opened its economy to foreign direct investment (FDI) in the period of liberalization started in 1991 and since then aggressive efforts have been made to achieve this
 pichley hafte hi epadiai niti ko or udaar tathaa saral banaaya gaya he taaki desh main kaarobaar sugam ho or epadiai pravaah bade
 The amount of FDI is continuously increasing, but a deeper analysis of its data reveals many new facts
 epadiai pravaah badhaane ke peeche soch yah hoti he ki desh main nivesh, logon kii aay or rojgaar ko badhaayaa jaae
 But in previous years it has not been tried to assess whether this capital has actually been of any benefit and whether the objective with which FDI is being promoted is actually being met
 saal 2008-09 ke baad epadiai pravaah ke growth rate main kamisarkari aankadon ke mutabik, sakal epadiai pravaah (equity, phir se nivesh kii gai kamai or anya puunji) saal 2000-01 ke 17,557 karod rupee se badhkar saal 2018-19 main 4,49,616 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 The share of equity in this has increased from Rs 10,733 crore to Rs 3,09,867 crore during this period
 lekin epadiai inflo main salanaa growth yaa gros phixd capital formation (GFCF) ke pratishtata ke lihaaj se dekhen to 2008-09 ke baad epadiai inflo yani desh ke bheetar aane vaale epadiai main baari giravat ai he
 This means that the Make in India campaign of 2014 has not accelerated this either
 GFCF kaa matlab yah hota he ki iconomi main jo nayaa dhan aayaa he uskaa kitna hissaa nivesh kiya gaya he (upbhog nahin), yani yah nivesh kaa suchak hota he
 The annual growth in FDI and FDI equity inflows reached single digit in 2016-17 and declined in 2018-19
 kuch or nakaaratmak sanketapadiai ke lihaaj se ek or mahatvapurn trend hota he repatriation or rienvestment arning kaa, yah vah aay hoti he jo bhartiya arthvyavastha main waapas aa jaati he
 That is, if a foreign company is making money from FDI, then how much is it investing here and how much of its earnings from FDI are investing afresh here
 is maamle main donon sanket nakaaratmak hai
 This means that more and more capital is going out and this is eroding the potential benefits of FDI in the Indian economy
 saal 2008-09 tak aay kaa repatriation kaaphi kam tha, lekin yah 2009-10 main yah badhkar epadiai equity inflo ke 17
 9% and reached 48% in 2017-18
 repatriation badhane kaa matlab yah he ki bhartiya arthvyavastha se zyada puunji baahar ja rahi he
 Similarly, FDI accounted for 60 per cent of equity inflows in reinvested earnings in 2002-03, but fell to just 28 per cent in 2017-18
 iskaa matlab yah he ki companiyaan zyada se zyada munafa desh se baahar le ja rahi hai
 What is the benefit of FDI inflows, less is available
 Getting FDI is not just about acquiring foreign capital
 1991 kii audyogic niti main tatkaaleen sarkaar ne kaha tha ki arthvyavastha ko epadiai ke liye kholane ke peeche soch yah he ki ‚Äòtechnology transfar, marketing exparties kaa phayda mili, aadhunik menagerial takanic hasil ho or niryaat ko badhaava dene kii nai sambhaavnaaen paidaa hon
 The FDI statement released in 2017 also said that there should be a possibility of promoting economic growth
 lekin sarkaar ke paas is baat kaa koi jawaab nahin he ki ye phaayde bharat ko mili hai yaa nahin
 The emphasis was always on how much FDI is coming
 udhaaharan ke liye saal 2013-14 ke bajet bhaashan main tatkaaleen sarkaar ne eemaandaaree se yah baat sweekaar kii thi ki chaalu khate ke ghate (CAD) kii bharpai ke liye epadiai jaruri he
 Since then it has been consistently claimed that FDI is boosting manufacturing and employment, but many times in the Lok Sabha, the government has accepted that it does not have any data to substantiate such claims
 epadiai kaa kai dashakon tak study karne vaale institute for studies in industrial deveopment ke professor chalaapati raav ne kaha, ‚Äòis bare main jaanane kii koi vyavastha nahin he ki desh main epadiai se koi bhala hua he, khaskar technology transfar or rojgaar ke masale par
 a report by NITI Aayog in the year 2018, New India @ 75, says, "if India is to become the world's workshop, we have to encourage FDI in manufacturing
" ‚Äôsarvice sector main zyada epadipadiai equity inflo ke aankadon se ek or jaankaree saamne ai he ki epadiai equity kaa bada hissaa menuphaccharing (34%, automobil, chemical, dawaaen aadi) kii jagah sevaaon (65
 4% came in financial services, software, telecommunications, construction etc
)
 yahi nahin, menuphaccharing main aane vaali epadiai equity kaa kareeb aadha hissaa maujuuda kaarobaar ko kharidne main ja rahaa he, na ki koi nai kshamta sthapit karne main
 Professor Rao says that his study has shown that between 2004 and 2014, about 55% of the actual FDI equity inflows in manufacturing was spent on buying existing factories or acquiring existing investors
 isse kisi bhi tarah ke kshamta yaa rojgaar kaa srijan nahin hua he
 The tone of opposition to the Pakistani Prime Minister's visit to Ajmer is intensifying
 virodh ke taur-tareeke or sur main bhale hi kuch algaav dikhe, par saar ek hi he ki dushman jaisaa bartaav karne vaale padosi mulk ke pradhanmantri kaa swaagat kyon?bhartiya sainikon kaa sir kalam karne se bigadaa mahaulpakistani sena dwaara haal hi main bhartiya sainikon ko maar daalane or unka sir kalam kar dene kii ghatana ke virodh main desh ke logon kaa gussa footkar saamne aa rahaa he

 ‚Äô unhone kaha, ‚Äòyah pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke daure ke khilaaf apana virodh darj karaane ke liye he
 Rajesh Tandon, a representative of the Ajmer Bar Association Ajmer Bar Association in Taish, said that the roads through which Ashraf's convoy would pass would be washed with water after the convoy passed, as their passing would 'pollute' the land
 unhone kaha, ‚Äòvidesh mantri salmaan khurshid ashraf ke liye dopaher bhoj yojit kar rahe hai jo ki sharmnaak he
