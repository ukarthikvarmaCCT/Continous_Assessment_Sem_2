 ) The quarrel between Sheri Paaji and the Maharaja has now reached the court of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai bijepi se chunaav ke pehle congress main aae navjot singh siddhu or punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh kii
 In fact, Sidhu, who was an MP from Amritsar, joined the party along with his supporter Damandeep when he joined the Congress
 ab amritsar main apana dabadabaa chaahane ke lihaaj se siddhu ne damandeep ko amritsar kaa meyar banane ke liye captain par dabaav banaaya
 But Captain Amarinder Singh did not listen to Sidhu
 captain ne saaf kar diya ki puraane congressiyon ko tarjeeh di jaaegi
 After this, Sidhu also tried to show strength through the members, but the number force was in favor of the captain
 aise main narajasiddhu ne rahul gandhi se milakarshikayat karne ke liye vakt maanga
 When Sidhu met Rahul on Thursday, he was there to complain, but on the contrary Rahul expressed his displeasure with Sidhu
 ye wo lamhaa tha, jisaki shaayad siddhu ne ummid hi nahin kii hogi
 Anyway, when Sidhu joined Congress, then the important role and all the talks were done through Priyanka Gandhi
 rahul ne sirf muhar lagaai thi
 But now Rahul was facing President Sidhu
 hua yun ki siddhu jab captain kii shikaayat karne pahunche to usase pehle hi captain ne apni report rahul ko saunp di thi
 The Captain stated clearly in his report that Sidhu only wants his dominance in Amritsar
 isliye vah apane us samarthak damandeep ko vahaan kaa meyar bananaa chaahate hai, jo sirfasiddhu bhaktahai, raajnneeti main utane sakriy bhi nahin hai
 While the old Congress leaders are already in the queue
 saath hi siddhu iske liye party main foot daalane kii bhi koshish kar rahe the, jisamen naakaam rahe
 The Captain's report mentioned one particular thing that Sidhu did not campaign despite saying in the Himachal and Gujarat assembly elections
 bas yahi baat rahul ko khaastaur par akhar gai
 Actually, Himachal is exactly adjacent to Punjab
 demand ke baavjood siddhu vahaan prachaar karne nahin gaye
 In-charge Asha Kumari asked Sidhu to campaign, but Sidhu ignored
 iske baad maamla rahul tak pahunchaa or 4 disambar ko rahul ke party adhyaksh pad ke namakan ke din jab siddhu congress mukhyalay aae to khud rahul ne siddhu se himachal main prachaar nahin karne kii baat uthaate hue aage gujarat main chunaav prachaar karne kaa nirdesh diya
 But Sidhu, who defied the party and Rahul, did not go to campaign in Gujarat after Himachal Pradesh
 gujarat chunaav rahul ke kaaphi kareeb rahaa
 Rahul put his full emphasis there
 haalanki kam antar se congress takkar dete hue chunaav haar gai
 In such a situation, Rahul did not even go to promote Sidhu in Gujarat
 isiilienvajot singh siddhudilli aae to captain se apni naaraazgi jataane the, lekin ulte rahul kii naaraazgi sunakar laute
 Perhaps we can say that this opener of Team India was on the political pitch of Punjab, when Rahul came to the court, it was a six, but it itself became a hit wicket
 film kaa naam:talwardiarector:meghna gulzarstar cast:niraj kabi, irfan khan, konkana sen, tabboo, soham shah, gajraj raav, atul kumaunvadhi:132 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3 starmeghna gulzaar, mashhoor geetkaar gulzaar or abhinetri raakhi kii beti hai
 Meghna has taken films like 'filhaal' to the audience, followed by 'just Married' and 'ten Stories' in 2007
 meghna ne 8 saal baad mashhoor aarushi murder cese jaanch ke maddenjar film banaai he
 Now has Meghna fully communicated her point to the public? Let's review the film
 kahanefilm kii kahani 2008 main dilli se sate noida main hue aarushi murder cese kii jaanch par aadhaarit he
 The story is of the Tandon couple, in which Ramesh Tandon (neeraj Kabi), Nutan Tandon (konkona Sen) live with their daughter Shruti Tandon
 shruti kaa murder ghar ke naukar khempal ke saath ek hi raat hota he jisaki jaanch pehle police or baad main sidiai officer aswin kumaar (irfan khan) ke haath lagati he or teen tarah kii jaanch pesh kii jaati he
 The story of the scriptfilm is written by Vishal Bhardwaj and he has tried very hard to highlight the main points revealed in the investigation of Aarushi Murdercase
 kahani main 3 alag-alag faislon par bhi vishesh tippanee kii gai he
 Seeing the filming of father-daughter, mother-daughter, parents, parents-daughter and servants, it seems that there has been a lot of research behind the writing of this film
 script level par vishaal ne koi kami nahin chodi he
 The final 12 minutes look more interesting
 samvaad kabhi-kabhi aapako hansane par vivash bhi karte hai
 Acting The biggest triumph of this film is its casting
 ek se badhkar ek abhinayta irfan khan, niraj kabi, konkana sen ne bahut hi umdaa acting k udhaaharan pesh kiya he vahiin ek special role main ek baar phir se tabboo ne bataa diya kii aakhir kyon unhen behtareen actress kaha jaataa he
 Konkona, who plays Neeraj Kabi and mother in the role of a father, has done a very touching act
 vahiin jaanch ke kaary main jute irfan khan kii acting kii taiyaari bhi rang laai he
 The specialty of the actors in the film makes it less serious and more interesting
 sangitafilm ke sangeet ne bhi kaaphi ahm role nibhaayaa he
 Gulzar's writing and Vishal Bhardwajka's music is very popular and he carries the story forward
 vaise to koi bhi lip sinc vaala geet nahin he lekin jab bhi becoground main aalaap aate hai, aap kahani se bandha jate hai
 The song sung by Rekha Bhardwaj is also touched
 kamjor kadifilm kii maatr ek kamjor kadi lagati he, jab ek jaanch se duusare jaanch ke bich kaa switch hota he
 The third level check seems weak
 irfan khan kii jaanch prakriya ke baad atul kumaar kaa trek halkaa prathit padataa he
 Why see the best acting, if you are fond of the story based on the Satya incident, then do not miss this film at all
 sochane par vivash karti he talwaar
 This may shock some people, but there is also a difference in the purity of hallmarked gold jewelery in India
 world gold council (dablyoojisi) ne aaj yah baat kahi
 With this, the WGC has emphasized the need to improve the quality standards in the world's most gold consuming country

 WGC India Managing Director Somasundaram PR said, 'hallmarking is not necessary and consumer awareness is limited
 aise main jewelers ise lekar adhik utsahit nahin rahete hai
 The special thing is that both Hallmark and Hallmark Gold are sold in the same shop
 ' The WGC said that improving the hallmarking system of the country will not only give success to the gold monetization scheme, but it will also bring the country's gold exports from the current $ 8 billion to $ 40 billion in the next five years

 Adding to the tone of chief selector MSK Prasad, former India captain Sourav Ganguly has also named Wriddhiman Saha as the wicket-keeper in the Test

 Significantly, in most of the Test series against England due to Saha's injury, Parthiv played the responsibility behind the wicket
 is dauraan gujarat ranjai team ke captain parthiv ne balle se bhi acha pradarshan kiya tha
 However, playing an unbeaten 203 not out in the Irani Trophy, Saha made himself stand far ahead of Parthiv

 ye katai zaruri nahin ki koi aapse pyaar kare hi kare, zindagi ke liye zaruri he aapkaa pyaar main hona
 There will be some such crazy people who in spite of all the problems in 'leh', just reach to meet their love
 ab ye dikkatein kya hai, ye aapako vahaan jane se pehle hi koi naa koi zarur bataa degaa
 Lack of oxygen, lack of basic facilities, short days and less excuses for spending time
 isliye doston ko zarur lekar jaaiyegaa
 Well, i am not fond of traveling but this year have thought that there are some places to see
 to sabase pehle leh janaa tay hua
 There is only 1 hour journey by plane
 zyaadaatar yaayavar diwane bike par janaa pasand karte hai or puraa leh is tarah ghoomane main unhen takreeban 15 din kaa vaqt lagata he
 As soon as i landed at Leh Airport in the morning, the eyes drank like a drink and all that was visible was just intoxication
 kaha gaya tha ki leh pahunchate hi aaraam karnaa kyonki bahut oonchai par basaa he
 You have difficulty keeping pace with the weather
 mujhe to jate hi neend aa gayi thi kyonki usase pehali raat main soyi hi nahin thi
 After getting up, all the friends came out and went to the Shanti Stupa nearby
 chaaron ore itnaa sundar najaara tha ki bas sadak par hi let jate the
 What to do, drug is like that
 tabhi to vahaan par sharaab, cigarette pine vaale log nahin mili
 If you get to see desert, mountains, rivers, rocks, and snowfall, sun, shade, rain in one place, then you will say that Leh, you are the modern art of God
 aakhir main khuda ne leh ko banaaya hoga or apni sari kalakaari dikhaa di hogi
 There are not many colors here, there are shades
 pahaado ke shades, chattaanon ke shades
 There are not so many shades in the wardrobe of girls' clothes
 koi yahaan aae to zarur agali dress yahaan kii vaadiyon kii shades se mila kar legi
 More ice than milk
 kufri kii tarah pili nahin
 It is good that that mule does not ride here
 varanaa aap us badboo main apane metro shahar ko hi yaad karne lagate
 The moon is very kind here at night
 raat ko aasmaan main angadaai liye badalon ko aaraam se dekha ja saktaa he
 Poplar trees are also standing like antennae, pointing out that yes, this is the place where sunshine and moonlight showers more
 ye jagah sirf diwaanon ke liye he jo yaa to yayavari se pyaar karte hai yaa shaanti se
 This place is not suitable for those who are expecting a place like Shimla, Manali and throwing empty packets on the streets and leaving their bad memories for these litigants
 dekhne ko leh main kaaphi jagahen hai lekin aisi koi jagah nahin jahaan aap jaakar mahasoos karen ki vaah kya jagah he
 There are only paths here which are beautiful
 itane khubasurat kii aap kahin nahin pahunchnaa chaahate
 Just want to keep going
 zindagi kaa mazaa bhi to sirf manzil tak pahunchane tak hi rahata he
 However, if you want to go, then go to Magnetic Hill and see how a mountain is pulling your closed car
 leh pales
 There are some old Buddhist monasteries
 ek war museum he jahaan bharat-pakistan kii ladaaiyon ke kuch avshesh sanjoye hai
 You must have seen the beauty of Pang Gong River in many films
 ek subah oxigen kii kami se jaldi aankh khul gayi to ajaan sun kar yakeen sa nahin hua
 There has been a lot of spread of Buddhism there, but one thing that is worth seeing is that Santoshi Mata temple, gurudwara, mosque are all present there
 ek jagah jahaan ki jansankhya dedh lakh bhi nahin he, vahaan takreeban sabhi mukhya dharmon ne apane anuyaayi dhund hi liye hai
 Just like every band on TV gets Twitter followers
 zyaadaatar sab log hindi bhi bolte hai
 Some English too
 ab yahaan mukhya taur par rozi-roti tourism par hi chalati he to logon ko hindi seekhni hi thi
 It tells us that language is our need, not a reason for pride
 lekin isaki garima, garv par aae din bahes hoti hi rahati he
 There is a lot of honesty among the people here
 agar aap khaddung laa jaaenge jo ki duniya kii sabase oonchi sadak he jahaan aap drive kar sakate hai, itani oonchai par bhi aapako 10 rupee kii chocolate 10 rupee main hi milegi
 There is much to tell, but just take the rating from here and go and wonder yourself whether there will be anything more beautiful than this
 agar aap apni koi backet list bana rahe hai to leh ko zarur shaamil karen
 This modern art will be forever in your memories

 Actually, Vindu Dara Singh had first tweeted that Vikas had good intents for Priyank
 lekin ab unhen priyank ko sudhaarney main apana vakt barbaad nahin karnaa chahie
 Even after eating Salman's scolding several times, Priyank continues to prove his stupidity
 VIKAS has good intentions for PRIYANK but now he should not WASTE his time in correcting PRIYANK !even after being reprimanded by SALMAN on several occasion PRIYANK is adamant on proving his "FOOLISHNESS" # BB11— Vindu Dara Singh (@realvindusingh)november 26, 2017vindu ke isi twit ko retweet kar karan ne chutki lete hue likhaa, vindu paaji shaayad isi ko kehete hai 'sar mundavate hi ole pad gaye'

 isi act par mazaakia andaaj main coment karte hue karan patel ne priyank ke khilaaf talkh tippanee kar di
 BIGG BOSS: Karan Patel slapped Hina Khan, said- Naive Surat, dirty intentions: Before this, Karan Patel had put Hina Khan's class fiercely
 iklaute karan hi is troling main shaamil nahin the
 Kamya Punjabi, Gauhar Khan, Kishwar Merchant, Eli Goni and Vindu Dara Singh also beat Hina Khan a lot
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne videshi bainkon main kalaadhan jamaa karne or kar chori ke aaropee hasan ali khan ko paryaapt suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kaa centre or maharashtra sarkaar ko nirdesh diya
 The court also asked the investigators to record video of the statements of the accused and witnesses in the case involving Pune businessman Khan

 During the hearing, Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam told the apex court that the government was not in favor of setting up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) at this stage to investigate money laundering by Khan and deposit black money in foreign banks
 unhone daleel di ki maamle kii jaanch kar rahi vibhinn agenciyon ko padtaal jari rakhane dena chahie or agar agenciyon kii jaanch nattejey nahin dikhaate to nyaayalay dwaara baad main esaiti gathit karne par faisla kiya ja saktaa he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the Narendra Modi government has taken a big decision
 somvaar ko hui kendriya cabinet kii baithak main faisla kiya gaya he ki ab savarna jatiyon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan diya jayega
 These reservations will be given to economically weaker upper castes
 bataa den ki 2018 main SC / ST act ko lekar jis tarah modi sarkaar ne supreme court kaa faisla palat diya tha, usase savarna khaasaa naaraaz bataaya ja rahaa tha
 It is believed that on Tuesday, the Modi government can present the Constitution amendment bill in Parliament
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko hi sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr kaa aakhri din he
 Who will get the benefit? The person who has more property than the limit, will not get the benefit of this amendment
 sutron kii maane to ye aarakshan 8 lakh salanaa aamadani or 5 acre se kam jameen vaale savarnon ko mil saktaa he
 Apart from this, those who will have their own house on government land (DDA, corporation land) will also not get the benefit
 in sabhi ko milegaa laabh>jinaki salanaa aay 8 lakh se kam ho>jinke paas 5 hectare se kam kii kheti kii jameen ho>jinke paas 1000 squaire feet se kam kaa ghar ho>jinke paas nigam kii 109 gaj se kam adhishuchet jameen ho>jinke paas 209 gaj se kam kii nigam kii gaiyr-adhishuchet jameen ho> jo abhi tak kisi bhi tarah ke aarakshan ke antargat nahin aate thesanvidhan main karnaa hoga badlaavapako bataa den ki modi sarkaar ye aarakshan aarthik aadhaar par laa rahi he, jisaki abhi samvidhan main vyavastha nahin he
 The constitution talks about reservation on the basis of caste, so the government will have to amend the constitution to implement it
 sarkaar ke is faisle ko loksabhaa chunaav se jodate hue dekha ja rahaa he
 The government will soon change the constitution for this
 iske liye samvidhan ke anuchhed 15 or anuchhed 16 main badlaav kiya jayega
 Changing both the paragraphs will pave the way for reservation on economic grounds
 bijepi se naaraaz the savarna!aapako bataa den ki pichley saal jab supreme court ne SC / ST act main badlaav karne kaa aadesh diya tha, tab deshbhar main daliton ne kaaphi pradarshan kiya tha
 In view of this, the decision of the Supreme Court was changed by the Central Government
 mana ja rahaa tha ki modi sarkaar ke is faisle se savarna kaaphi naaraaz ho gaye hai
 After the Dalit bandh, the upper castes also called for a Bharat Bandh
 centre sarkaar ke is faisle ke baad raajnneetik pratikriyaayein aani shuru ho gai hai
 Read here the reactions of all political parties, leaders
 
 
 congress –congress ke ami yajyanik kaa kahana he ki is prakaar ke aarakshan par kaaphi takniki dikkatein hai, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle is prakaar aarakshan dene kaa kya makasad he ye bhi dekhnaa hoga
 He said that it may take a long time for the bill to come and pass on this issue
 sarkaar is mudde ko lekar syrius nahin he
 Union Minister Ramdas Athawale has welcomed the decision by Union Minister Ramdas Athawale
 unka kahana he ki sarkaar kaa ye faisla kaaphi acha he, isse samaaj ke ek bade tabake ko laabh hoga
 He said that there are many people in the upper castes who are financially weak
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 Reservation to upper castes: BJP said 56-inch decision, Congress bid- it's just a joke maharashtra main mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke shapath grahan samaaroh main khaasi maan manouvval ke baad shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare shaamil to ho gaye, lekin ab unka kahana he ki bijepi gathbandhan par jald koi faisla karen
 It is reported from the sources that the Shiv Sena has given an ultimatum to the BJP and said that the BJP should decide on the alliance before the trust vote
 shivasena ne chetavanee di he ki agar bijepi aisa nahin karti he to sadan main vishwaas mat ke dauraan vah bijepi ke kilaaf vot karegi
 According to sources, the Shiv Sena is seeking a 2: 1 formula in the cabinet with the BJP and in the event of this not happening, the Shiv Sena is also ready to sit in the opposition

 lekin isi seat se jitkar loksabhaa pahunche congress ke 2-2 netaa kabhi rajya ke mukhyamantri bhi rahe hai
 So this seat is important for both Congress and BJP parties
 purv kendriya mantri or bijepi ke divangat netaa anant kumaar 6 baar bengalooru dakshin seat se saansad rah chuke hai
 Currently, this seat is vacant since his death

 Three times the Janata Party candidate won here and since 1991, BJP has been winning this seat 7 times in a row
 isamen se 6 baar bijepi ke anant kumaar yahaan se vijayi hue hai
 This seat was earlier in Mysore State but since 1977 this seat has become part of Karnataka state
 pehle is seat ko bengalooru ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Former Karnataka Chief Minister h Hanumantha has also won this seat on a Congress ticket
 iske alaava saal 1980-83 main rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe aar gundu raav bhi loksabhaa main is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 Of the 8 assembly seats under the Bangalore South Lok Sabha constituency, BJP has 5 and Congress has 3 seats

 5 lakh men and 9

 Since the 2014 mandate, the seat was still in the possession of BJP for 23 years before the 2014 elections
 lekin modi lahar main is seat par anant kumaar ne apane raajnneetik kariyar kii sabase badi jeet hasil kii
 He gave Congress candidate and former UIDAI chairman Nandan Nilekani about 2
 28 lakh voton se haraaya
 6 to Kumar
 33 lakh vot hasil hue jabik nilekani 4
 05 lakhs were reduced within
 is chunaav main jedies or aam aadmi party ke 3 fisadi ke bhi kam vot mili
 In the earlier elections, Ananth Kumar defeated leaders like Congress' BK Hariprasad and Krishna b Gowda but then the difference of votes was not so big
 is seat se chhathi baar jitkar sansad pahunche anant kumaar kaa kad centre main or bad gaya, vah karnataka main bijepi ke sabase bade netaa maane jate the
 He came to be called the troubleshooter of the Modi government because he had a foothold in all the parties and was an expert in flow management
 yahi vajah rahi ki unhen sansadeey kaary mantri jaisaa ahm pad saunpa gaya tha
 The mp's report card was the late leader of BJP and former Union Minister Anant Kumar MP from the Bengaluru South Lok Sabha seat 
 anant kumaar saal 1996 se lagaataar is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 His political journey started from student politics and ended by becoming a minister at the center

 haalanki unhone kabhi karnataka kii raajnneetik main sakriyata nahin dikhaai, ve karnataka main rahakar bhi dilli main party ke haath majboot karne main lage rahe
 Anant Kumar died on November 12 last year at the age of 59, he was suffering from cancer
 kumaar apane peeche 2 betiyaan chhod gaye hai
 According to his 2014 affidavit, he has about 4
 5 karod kii sampatti he or unka koi bhi aapraadhik record nahin he

 vittiya ghate ke prabandhan main lakshya se pichad rahi modi sarkaar petrol-dijal par tex kam karne ke mood main nahin he
 But in view of the pressure of opposition and resentment in the public, the government is trying to find some other way
 iske liye kachche tel kii aapurti karne vaali saarvajanik company oengisi se kaha ja saktaa he ki vah kuch boj uthaae
 If this scheme is effective, then the price of petrol and diesel can be reduced by up to Rs 2 per liter
 sasta tel dene kaa ho saktaa he aadeshindian express kii khabar ke anusaar petroleum mantralay saarvajanik company oil and natural gas corporation (ONGC) se yah kah saktaa he ki vah bade daam kaa kuch boj sahe or riyayati daam par kachche tel kii aapurti kare
 Talking to the newspaper, a government official said, "the ministry will instruct ONGC to sell crude oil at less than the international price
 puure saal ke liye keemat 70 dollar prati bairal tak hi rakhane ko kaha ja saktaa he
 It is worth noting that ONGC imports crude oil and supplies it to oil refines and marketing companies in the country
 oengisi ke alaava oil india limited bhi kaccha tel bechati he, lekin philhal use bakhsha ja rahaa he
 ONGC supplies around 20 per cent of crude oil to the needs of oil refining-marketing companies like IOC, HPCL and BPCL
 lekin june 2015 tak tel par salanaa sabsidi bill kaa 40 fisadi hissaa oengisi or oil india kaa tha
 Can also run on dealers' margins
 Scissors ONGC if it works as per the government's plan, then the increase in oil price needed to be reduced to one third
 iske alaava sarkaar dilers kekamishan membhi dijal par 18 paise prati litre or petrol par 23 paise prati litre kii katautee kar sakati he

 kai rajya sarkaron ke inkaar ke baad ab centre sarkaar ne apni mahatvakankshi yojana 'modi care' ko lekar aaj baithak bulaai he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced the scheme with the name 'ayushman Bharat' to provide health services to 50 crore people in this year's budget
 daawa kiya gaya ki logon ko swasthya sevaayen uplabdh karaane vaali ye sarkari yojana duniya main apni tarah kii sabase badi yojana hogi
 The government has started an exercise for how this scheme will be launched on the ground
 centre sarkaar ne brihaspativaar ko sabhi rajyon ke swasthya sachivon kii baithak bulaai he
 In this meeting, the modalities of implementing the health plan will be discussed
 do divasiy baithak main centre sarkaar or niti ayog ke adhikari bhi maujuud rahenge
 Under the National Health Protection Scheme popularly known as 'modi Care', there is a target to provide health insurance of up to Rs
 5 lakhs per year to 10 crore families i
e
 about 50 crore people, but this decision has not been decided yet
 How it will be implemented
 bajet bhaashan main yojana kaa elaan hone ke baad vipaksh samet swasthya kshetra se jude jaankaron ne bhi is par sawaal uthaae the
 He said that the government has allocated only Rs 2000 crore in the budget for the scheme
 isse itane logon ko swasthya beemaa de paanaa kaise mumkin he
 It is being told that under this scheme, the central government wants the state governments to bear 40 percent of the expenditure on it
 centre sarkaar khud yojana kaa 60 fisadi kharch uthaane ke liye taiyaar he
 Many states have also lost the Palla due to the dusty plan
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjeene saaf kar diya he ki vah 'ayushmaan bharat' kaarykram ko apane rajya main lagu nahin karengin
 He argues that he finds this a waste of money and already a health insurance scheme is running in West Bengal on behalf of the state government
 tamilnadu, karnataka, andhra pradesh, telugana jaise kuch or rajyon main bhi alag-alag tareeke kii swasthya beemaa yojanaayen pehle se chal rahi hai
 In such a situation, the states which do not have a BJP government will be part of this ambitious plan of the Central Government or not, it is difficult to say
 centre sarkaar ko yah bhi tay karnaa he ki swasthya beemaa yojana ke tahat koun koun si bimaariyaan cover hongi
 According to sources of the NITI Aayog, it is clear that every kind of disease cannot be included in the insurance scheme for Rs 5 lakh
 aam chunaav se pehle launch karne kii taiyariswasthya beemaa yojana lagu karne ke liye premium dene kaa model kya ho is baat ko lekar bhi abhi vichaar-vimarsh chal rahaa he
 Some states have formed trusts for health insurance while in some places insurance companies provide this facility in lieu of premium
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar 15 agast yaa 2 oktober se is yojana ko lagu karnaa chaahati he, lekin abhi isaki taiyaari puri nahin hui he
 It is believed that the government will implement it in some states first and then it will be expanded to the whole country
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav hone he or BJP sarkaar yah jarur chaahegi ki chunaav se pehle yah yojana lagu ho jaae taaki chunaav ke vakt iskaa phayda bijepi ko mil sake

 mumbai main film nirmaataaon, kalakaaron, uttar bhartiya taxi driveron, rehadi waalon or rojgaar kii talash main duusare rajyon se aae yuvakon main dabangai se dehshat paidaa karnaa
 Whose juggle is this? Incidents of hostage of the country's business capital Mumbai are increasing on behalf of the feuding activists of Raj Thackeray's party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)
 kabhi rashtriyata ke naam par to kabhi maharashtra kii asmita ke naam par
 All this is happening in the same Mumbai which is also called Mayanagari because of the dazzling world of Bollywood
 karan johar kii film ko lekar di thi dhamkeehal main nirmaataa-nirdeshak karan johar kii film 'e dil he mushkil' ko lekar MNS ne kaise khuli dhamkiyaan deen, ye puri duniya ne dekha
 MNS announced that 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' will not be allowed to release due to Pakistani actor Fawad Khan being in the film
 MNS ne is mudde par phir ascharyajanak dhang se apane kadam waapas bhi khinch liye
 Are these demonstrations linked to patriotism? The nation is forced to think that the mns's fierce sit-in demonstrations, which often lead to freedom of speech and violation of civil rights, are really linked to patriotism? But the truth that Aaj Tak / India Today's Special Investigation Team (SIT) has found by going to the bottom is astonishing
 aisa nahin he ki ki MNS ke saare hi pradarshan isaki vichaardhaara se prerit hote hai
 - Market of protest performance - Aaj Tak / India Today under-cover reporters went to every corner of Mumbai to see how some thugs appeared ready to perform with money under the cover of MNS

 Some MNS leaders agreed to hold demonstrations in Mumbai through 'gunda Squad' whenever they wanted

 Athar Shah stated this price when he was asked whether he could stage a violent demonstration? Claims of half price work BMC elections in Mumbai are on the head
 is chunaav main ummidavaari ke liye khud ko prabal daavedaar bataane vaale atahar shah ne kaha, "agar aap kisi or ke paas jaaenge to wo 50 lakh rupye charge karegaa
 We will do all this for 25 lakh rupees only
 "kaha- chunaav prachaar main lagegaa paisatahar shah ke mutabik hinsak pradarshan ke liye jo rakam milegi, wo farvari main hone vaale BMC chunaav ke unke prachaar abhiyaan main madad karegi
 Utahar Shah, for economic reasons, confessed that the MNS leaders like him created in the streets in the name of national and Marathi issues are purely for economic reasons
 rashtriyata katai uddeshy nahiundercover reporter ne atahar shah ko taakid kiya, "ye dhyaan main rakhana ki hamaare sanghathan kaa rashtriyata jaisaa katai uddeshy nahin he
 "it was also clarified that the vested interests wanted to have such a demonstration
 trephic jam se lekar hinsa takais par atahar shah kaa jawaab tha- "main puri tarah samajhataa hum ki ye bijness he
 If they benefit from it (performance), then i will too
 " phir atahar ne ye bhi bataaya ki unke tarkash main pradarshan ke koun-koun se tir maujuud hai
 In this, they counted from traffic jams to street violence
 hinsak hamale, gundgardee, trephic jam, patharacetahar shah kaa sawaal tha- "aap bataaie, aapke sanghathan ko kya chahie? hinsak hamale, gundgardee, trephic jam, patharav?"or bhi netaa dikhe taiyaaraaisa nahin ki pryojit pradarshan karaane ke liye MNS main akele atahar shah hi taiyaar mili
 The team of Aaj Tak / India Today contacted MNS Vice President Deepak Chavan of malad-malwani Ward in the second phase of the investigation
 inase bal-mazdooree ke mudde par pradarshan karaae jane kii baat kii gai
 Chavan appeared ready to perform without delay
 chavaan ne kaha, 'ye sab ho jayega
 "undercover reporter asked-" How many people can you raise in the performance? "chavan's answer was" 50
 
 
 100"under cover reporter- "kitne bhi hon, 50,100,200,150
 
 
 But you have to make sure that there is stone pelting and lathicharge (police)
 sab kuch media par aa sake
 "chavan made it clear that all this would happen but it would have a price
 chavaan ne kaha, "main nahin kah rahaa ki main ye muft main karuunga
 i did not say that
 ladke or unke log santusht hone chahie
 Those who are with me should not be angry
 unhen saaf taur par dikhnaa chahie ki unhen kya milane ja rahaa he?"-vasuuli kaa giroh-chavaan ne bal majudri par pradarshan apane liye aae-din kii baat bataaya
 But what Chavan said next was also going to shock the under-cover reporters
 chavaan ne kaha ki uske paas vasuuli kaa bada plan he
 Chavan- "I have something bigger to extract if you want to share it
 "reporter - "bada kya?"malad-malwani se MNS netaa ne phir bataaya ki wo ek real estate ke diggaj ko blike mail karne kaa plan bana rahaa he
 According to Chavan, the businessman has built residential apartments on the land of tribals in Mumbai
 under cover reporters ne jis kaalpanik NGO kaa naam lekar khud ko numaayinda bataaya tha, chavaan ne us NGO ko uske blike-mail ke plot main saath dene kii peshkash kii
 Chavan said, "they (tribes) are weak
 unki court tak pahunch nahin he
 Despite having all the valid documents, they cannot go anywhere
 "chavaan kaa mansuba us jaise rajaneta or ek NGO kaa gathjod kar pehle farji pradarshan karnaa or phir builder se moti rakam vasuulana tha
 
 chavaan ne under cover reporter se kaha- "hamen is kaam main do se chaar karod rupye milenge
 "under Cover Reporter" - This means that you intend to pressurize the builder to force him to talk to us
 " chavaan ne iskaa jawaab 'haa' main diya
 How the Gorakhdhandha special team goes on investigating how the MNS leaders like Shah and Chavan are trying to paint a democratic demonstration which is different from the acts of intimidation and cheating
 jaanch se saamne aayaa ki is tarah kii utpaati harkaton ko badhaava dene ke liye aanshik taur par sarkari tantra bhi jimmedaar he
 Athar Shah explained in detail how the police are used to bring down the domineering methods of his party
 atahar shah ne under cover reportron se vaada kiya ki jinke haath main kanoon kaa amal karaane kii jimmedaari he wo ise halke taur par lenge
 According to Athar Shah, when his men land in Mumbai to spread chaos, everything will be based on the script they have planned
 shah ne kaha, "pakke taur par afratfari hogi
 i will manage the police post
 main sab kuch dekh luungaa
 "reporter" - you will manage both the police post and the police station
 "shah- "main sab manage kar luungaa
 There will be no firing
 ham ise manage karenge
 They (police) will tell us to what extent they and we are
 yahi he sab
 "from what Shah said, this puzzling question certainly arises whether the police keep their eyes closed for the illegal protests in Mumbai
 -brinwashing-shah ne bataaya ki MNS guton main agar kisi kader ke khilaaf koi dikhaave kaa police cese darj hota he to use sammaan kaa tamgaa mana jaataa he
 Shah boasted, "if there is no case against anyone, then he is not an MNS worker
" "mahim se naata rakhane vaale MNS netaa aarif samim shaikh ne aapraadhik keson ko raaj thakare ke sanghathan kii vishisht pahchaan bataaya
 Sheikh said, "there are police cases
 agar cese nahin hai to MNS main hone ke koi myne nahin
 How will you be recognized again
 ye trademark kii tarah he
 "sheikh called violence the main vision of MNS
 shaikh ne kaha- "raaj (thakare) sahab kehete hai agar shabdon se kaam nahin bane to muththi bhincho or waar karo
 "according to the sub-system, MNS workers do their homework well before hitting their targets
 virdohi kii takat kya he, kanoonee pachadon par kya kharch aayega, in muddon par pehle hi soch liya jaataa he
 Sheikh said, "everything happens under one system
 hamen dekhnaa hota he ki doosraa paksh kitna majboot he
 Where to be performed hamen kitne aadamiyon kii jarurat hogi
 Also what will be the cost of lawyers
 "ajtak / india today kii vishesh jaanch team ne jin MNS netaaon se baat kii unamem se ek bhi aisa nahin mila jo hinsak pradarshan karaane ko taiyaar nahin mila

 Rajan said on the sidelines of a banking conference here that the country has about $ 380 billion in foreign capital reserves and will be used if needed
 somvaar ko mudra vinimay bazaar main rupee ne prati dollar 66
 Touched a two-year low of 47
 rajan ne pehle ek maukey par kaha tha ki arabiai desh kii arthvyavastha kaa chiyar leader nahin he
 On the lines of this, he again said that it is not the job of the RBI to accelerate the stock market
 rajan ne kaha, "mukhya daron main katautee ko aisi kharaat ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chahie, jise kaaphi maan manouvval ke baad arabiai detaa ho
 " rajan ne kaha, "balki jaruri cheez yah he ki mahangaai dar lagaataar kam rahe, jis par pradhanmantri ne bhi swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par die gaye bhaashan main charchaa kii thi
 In this case, RBI will have no hesitation in reducing the rate
 " Rajan said, “despite the dismal state of the global economy, the Indian economy is full of possibilities

 " rajan ne kaha, "haal ke varshon kii aarthik samasyaon kaa mul kaaran yah he ki bharat ne apane sansthaanon ko chota kar diya he
 The essence of the government and rbi's steps towards sustainable development is that we are setting up necessary institutions
 " On the decline in global trade, Rajan said that instead of focusing more on the rise and fall in the global market, the focus should be on increasing demand in the domestic market
 unhone kaha ki gharelu bazaar main maang badhaane ke liye sanrachanagat sudhaar kiya janaa chahie
 The comments rajan ne kaha ki agle maheene do nae laghu vitt bank ke liye license jari kiye jaaenge or do saamaanya bank shuru honge
 Rajan said that the immediate priority of the RBI is to reduce inflation and work closely with the government and banks to carry out projects stuck in crisis and correct the balance sheet of banks
 rajan ne yahaan ek banking sammelan ke itar maukey par kaha ki desh ke paas kareeb 380 arab dollar videshi puunji bhandar he or yadi jarurat padi to iskaa istemaal kiya jayega

 Rajan had earlier said on one occasion that RBI is not the cheer leader of the country's economy
 isi kii tarj par unhone phir kaha ki share bazaar main teji laane kaa kaam arabiai kaa nahin he
 Rajan said, "the reduction in key rates should not be seen as a money that RBI gives after much fanfare
 " Rajan said, "rather, it is important that inflation remains low, which was also discussed by the Prime Minister in a speech given on the occasion of Independence Day
 aisa hone par arabiai ko dar ghataane main koi hichak nahin hogi
 " rajan ne kaha, "vaishvik arthvyavastha kii niraashajanak haalat ke baavjood bhartiya arthvyavastha sambhaavnaaon se bhari hui he
 The main reason for the weakness of the global economy is that immediate solutions in those economies have been given attention, not long-term reforms
 " Rajan said, "the root cause of the economic problems of recent years is that India has shortened its institutions
 tikaoo vikaas ke liye sarkaar or arabiai ke kadamon kaa saar yah he ki ham jaruri santhaan khadey kar rahe hai
 " vaishvik vyapaar main giravat ke bare main rajan ne kaha ki vaishvik bazaar main teji or giravat par adhik dhyaan nahin dekar gharelu bazaar main maang badhaane par dhyaan dena chahie
 He said that structural reforms should be done to increase the demand in the domestic market

 Preparations are being made to install the first statue of Nathuram Godse in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan kii sidhauli tehsil ke paara gaanv main godse kaa mandir banane ke liye inten girava di gai hai
 Kamlesh Tiwari is constructing this on his own bigha land
 tiwari hindu mahasabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 They say that the statue will be consecrated on January 30, 2015, the day Gandhiji was killed
 jab ve yah baaten media se kar rahe the tab gaanv ke kareeb dedh hajaar log bhi maukey par the
 Whether or not the temple will be built, it is difficult to say now
 kyonki police-prashasan gaanv waalon ko chetavanee de aayaa he ki yadi aisa koi mandir bana to vah usase jude sabhi logon par rasuka ke tahat karrwai karenge
 Well, the thing that has spread all over the country is that Godse's statue is being installed somewhere
 iske myne kya hai-- maharashtra ke baraamati main janme godse ko sitapur main yah kahkar mahaan bataaya ja rahaa he ki gandhi ji hinduon ke saath anyaay kar rahe the or godse ne use 3 goliyaan dagkar roak diya
 Godse started opposing the Muslim League and its politics at the same time in 1940

 Godse, once associated with Gandhi's Civil Disobedience Movement, formed the militant organization Hindu Rashtra Dal
 - ve gandhi ji ke upwas kaaryakramon kaa bhi virodh karne lage
 Godse believed that by doing this, Gandhiji favored Muslims and ignored Hindus
 - nathuram godse ke bhai gopal godse apni kitaab main likhte hai ki desh vibhaajan ko lekar gandhi ji ke nazariye ne unke bhai ko sabase zyada vichlit kiya
 Gandhiji was not only supporting the partition but was also supporting the demand of Pakistan in which he was asking for 55 thousand crores from India
 - godse ne gandhi ji kii hatya kii bhoomika yah kehete hue banaai ki yadi gandhi ji rahenge to desh kaa jati or dharm ke naam par or vibhaajan karvaa denge
 That is, the dream of a united India will never be fulfilled

 congress netaa shashi tharur phir se bijepi ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 Earlier, he talked about India becoming Hindu Pakistan if Modi government won in 2019, now he says that BJP wants to Talibanize Hindutva
 bijepi lagaataar in bayanon ke liye tharur, congress or rahul gandhi ko gher rahi he lekin khud tharur isse beparwaah hai
 Tharoor says that he has not given any false statement
 unhone kaha ki bijepi vaale koun hai jo mujhe is desh se bhagaayenge
 i am also a citizen of this country and as a public representative i have every right to express my opinion
 ham nahin chaahate ki yah desh pakistan jaisaa desh bane
 These Hindutva people want to make our country a Hindu nation
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki ye log hamaare desh ke swatantraaa sangharsh ko kharaab kar rahe hai
 People of Pakistan think of building a country in the name of religion, but we can never think of it
 swatantraaa andolan main shaamil logon ne bhi yahi sochaa tha ki yah desh sabake liye hoga
 People of the Hindu community will also say that we want all people in the country to live together
 to phir bijepi ke log koun hote hai yah baat kehane vaale ki alag raay rakhane vaala shaks is hindustan main nahin rah saktaa
 Shashi Tharoor says that Taliban thinking says that those who do not follow their views should be killed
 is desh main ek raay nahin balki sabhi raay saath chalani chahie
 When Pakistan became in 1947, it became a religion for the people
 us vakt bhartiya netaaon ne kabhi nahin kaha ki bharat ek majahab kaa ho
 Tharoor said that we want people of all religions to live in this country, all Indians should have the same rights and everyone should have the same rights to live
 main vahi baat kar rahaa hum jo samvidhan main likhi he
 If Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls the Constitution a holy book, then he says that we will not create a Hindu nation
 hamaara samvidhan hi desh main sarvopari he or vahi chalanaa chahie
 Tharoor said that India is for everyone
 sabhi dharmon ke liye he, sabhi jatiyon or sabhi samudaayon ke liye he
 India is not for any particular person
 jis prakaar se pakistan muslim desh bana usee tarah ye is desh ko hindu pakistan bananaa chaahate hai
 But i do not want this country to become Pakistan
 shashi tharur ne kaha ki bijepi ke logon kii 'hindu raashtra' banane kii baaten bahut hi khatarnaak hai
 This thinking will destroy the country
 bataa den ki kerala main pichley hafte party ke ek samaaroh main bolte hue tharur ne kaha tha ki agar 2019 ke chunaav main bijepi phir jiti to samvidhan khatre main pad jayega
 The BJP will do everything to incorporate elements of its 'hindu Rashtra' principle
 aisa karne se bharat 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega
 Earlier, on Shashi Tharoor's statement about Hindutva, Union Minister Ashwini Choubey asked him to go to Pakistan and said that he is a Taliban himself
 choube ne kaha ki tharur ko bataanaa chahie ki kya vah talibani hai
 If you want to live in this country, then Hindutva cannot be abused, the country cannot be abused
 aswani choube ne kaha ki desh main rahakar koi hindutv ko gaali detaa he, to use pakistan chale janaa chahie
 There is no place in this country for such people
 choube kaa kahana he ki supreme court ne bhi kaha he ki hindutv ve of life he
 That is why Shashi Tharoor's statement is not correct
 aswani choube ne shashi tharur ke saath-saath congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par bhi vivaadit bayaan diya
 He said that the chief of his party, Babuya, is also engaged in ruining the Congress
 desh ko congress mukt karne ke prayaas main lage hai

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team Kapil Dev said on Tuesday that the young players have not let the lack of retired veterans on the basis of their best performance in recent times
 noida sthit jepi aspataal ke atyaadhunik 'department of sports medicine and rihabilitation' kaa udghaatan karte hue kapil ne yah baat kahi
 Kapil said that the youth have filled the gap between themselves and the veterans due to the excellent game
 kapil ne kaha, "in nae ladakon ne diggajon kii kami nahin khalane di he
 You see, in recent times, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Zaheer Khan and how many veterans have retired
 aise khilaadi jab jate hai to ek khai banati he lekin maujuuda team ke yuva khilaadiyon ne badi aasaani se apan or diggajon ke bich kii khai ko paat diya
 It all happened in such a way that we did not even know, otherwise the lack of Sachin is so missed that just do not ask
 "tippaniyan Kapil also said that these days Lokesh Rahul is in excellent form and he has proved himself in every format
 kapil ke mutabik yah team yuva or is lihaaj se sabko paryaapt mauka milanaa chahie
 Kapil said, "these new boys should get a lot of opportunity
 ye behad pratibhashali hai
 Take the captain
 viraat ko ek yaa do siries main kharaab pradarshan ke baad hataa denge to isse cricket ko hi nuksaan he
 Give him a chance, the results will start coming on their own
 " Kapil said, "these new boys have not let the lack of veterans
 aap dekhie, haal ke dinon main anil kumble, rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana, mahendra singh dhoni, saurav ganguli, sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag, jahir khan or na jane kitne diggajon ne sanyas liya he
 When such players leave, a gap is created, but the young players of the current team very easily bridge the gap between themselves and the veterans
 yah sab is tarah hua ki hamen pataa bhi nahin chalaa, nahin to sachin kii kami itani khalati ki bas puuchhie mat
 "comments kapil ne yah bhi kaha ki in dinon lokesh rahul behtareen farm main hai or unhone har formet main khud ko sabit kiya he
 According to Kapil, this team should be young and in this sense everyone should get enough opportunity
 bakaul kapil, "in nae ladakon ko bharpoor mauka milanaa chahie
 They are very talented
 captain ko hi lijie
 If we remove Virat after a poor performance in one or two series, then it is the loss of cricket itself

 The heat here is more than usual and in such a situation the business of tanker lobby supplying drinking water and open milk shake stalls is going on in various places

 This political group of Sunni Muslims is an ally of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) for the last 40 years

 We will repeat our 2011 performance again
 ''65 varshiya kunhalikutti ko party kaa 'siyaasi dimag' mana jaataa he
 He stands second from Vengara and is the Minister of Industry and Information Technology in Uman Chandy's government

 He was also named in the 'ice Cream Parlor' sex scandal and had to resign in 2005

 He lost to Kuttipuram in the 2006 assembly elections
 tab lig ko bhi apni sabase apmanjanak haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He contested 22 seats and only seven of his nominees could reach the assembly
 magar ab ek dashak ke baad kunhalikutti party ke ekmaatr netaa ke taur par ubhare hai, kam se kam aise netaa ke taur par jisaki ahmiyat he
 They say that they have become more old and intelligent now
 vengara main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kunhalikutti ne india today se kaha, ''beshak aapaki umr or tajurbe kaa aapke ravaiyon par kuch na kuch fark to padataa hi he, mujhamen behatari ke liye badlaav aayaa he
 Now i take the decision only after listening more
 '' yah unka grih nirvachan kshetra he or yahaan ke log or mudde unki ungaliyon kii poron par hai
 The party led by Kunhalikutty won a resounding victory in the 2011 assembly elections and also strengthened the hold on the Muslim vote bank
 isse unki siyaasi haisiyat main ijapha hua tha
 The veteran Siyasatdan and former IUML district secretary in Mallapuram M

 Says Thangal, "in fact, the most credit for stopping the LDF from returning to power in 2011 was to IUML
 agar duusari siton par musalamaanon ne congress ko vot na die hote to party buree tarah harati
 The state of which the total 3

 To cite his point, he cites the participation of a large number of Muslims in the freedom movement

 Folklore is not our way, our emotions are deeply rooted in Hindustani culture
 ''in ravaayaton ko khaasi tarjeeh di jaati he
 By the way, they are a thing of the past
 aayiumail ne bich kaa siyaasi rasta chunaa he or samudaay ke kai logon ko kattarta ke chhoron par dhakel diya he
 The party never took the path of aggressive politics
 yahaan tak ki 1992 main babari masjid ko dhahaae jane ke baad bhi usne aisa nahin kiya
 As a result, small discrete factions with more aggressive attitudes emerged
 1990 ke dashak main abdul nasar madani or unki piples democratic party (pidipi) unamem sabase awwal thi
 But since then he has been sidelined (he is currently in Bengaluru jail after being accused of all kinds of charges in the 1998 Coimbatore and 2008 Bangalore blasts)

 They feel that the Congress is merely playing the role of spectacle and is unable to safeguard their interests
 yah baat zyada lambey daur main aayiumail ko siyaasi taur par nuksaan pahunchaa sakati he
 On the other hand, CPM is trying a new political tool in the district
 ginati ke lihaaj se vam morche ke majboot garh do nirvachan kshetron ponnai or thawanur tak simat gaye hai
 But in Mallapuram district, overseeing the Left Front election campaign and CPM Central Committee member A
 vijayraghavan kehete hai, ''vam loktantric morche ke paas aayiumail ko uske gadhon main haraane kaa mukammal nakshaa he
 We have been working on this strategy since the 2014 general elections
 '' party ne kuch asardaar sthaneey kaarobaariyon or purv congress netaaon ko ldf ke ummidavaaron ke taur par utaara he
 However, the Left Front has not been able to make much dent

 But IUML leaders are not at all worried about what the 'hansiya Sunni' (about the AP faction's alliance with the Left Front) are going to do

 Now they are telling us what to eat, what to wear and how to salute your national flag? ”CPM veteran leader and former minister Paloli Mohammed Kutty says that everything is not going well in the fort of IUML 
 ve kehete hai, ''jile main vam morche ke haq main andar hi andar ek hawa jarur he
 Not only is there an anti-incumbency trend, apart from this Muslim youth are also worried about the economic slowdown in the Gulf countries

 They have their own separate politics, they do not run according to the politics of the Pancad dynasty headed by Madrasas or IUML
 ''marxvaadiyon ne auraton ke daste banaae hai, jo ghar-ghar jaakar unke liye vot maang rahe hai
 He has specifically targeted such families and youth who have been unhappy with the rise of power within the IUML

 Two list of BJP candidates in Maharashtra released Nitesh Rane did not name in the second list
 bhartiya janata party or shivasena gathbandhan ne apane-apane pratyaashiyon kii suchi jari kar di he
 BJP has so far released two lists of 139 candidates, but the surprising thing is that many of the party's heavyweights are missing from these two lists
 itnaa hi nahin, congress chhodkar bijepi ke saath aane vaale purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ke bete nitesh rane kaa naam bhi abtak ghoshit nahin kiya gaya he
 Even more shocking is that Narayan Rane, who reached the Rajya Sabha on a BJP ticket, had made a statement on Wednesday that his son Nitesh would contest on a BJP ticket and his name would be announced in the party's second list
 narayan rane ne kaha tha ki nitesh kankawali seat se hi chunaav ladenge
 However, when the second list of BJP came out on Wednesday evening, Narayan Rane's claim proved to be false
 bijepi ne apni duusari suchi main 14 pratyaashiyon ke naam kaa elaan kiya, lekin usamen nitesh rane ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 125 candidates were declared in the first list, before this the party has declared the names of 125 candidates
 is lihaaj se bijepi abtak kul 139 naamon kaa elaan kar chuki he
 But big names like Eknath Khadse, Vinod Tawde and Prakash Mehta have also not been included
 khadse to pehali suchi aane ke baad apana namakan bhi kar chuke hai
 However, the interesting thing is that the BJP has not even announced the name of any other candidate on the existing seats of these leaders
 yani ye siten abhi khaali rakhi gai hai
 So now that the days of Thursday and Friday are left for nomination, it will be interesting to see if BJP gives opportunity to these big faces

 The organization alleged that AAP workers were harming, removing or tearing down the posters, banners and other publicity material of the Swaraj campaign

 nitish ne kaha ki jab gathbandhan banataa he to usee samay vibhaag or unki sankhya bhi tay ho jaati he
 Currently the cabinet was vacant, so the cabinet was expanded
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi jagah khaali rahegi to kabhi bhi vistaar ho saktaa he
 He also said that everything is fine in the alliance
 vahiin up mukhyamantri susheel modi ne kaha ki nitish ji ne bulaakar kaha tha ki bijepi ke taraf se jo riktiyaan hai use bhi bharaa ja saktaa he
 Although only a few seats are vacant, BJP will also fill its seats when the time comes
 susheel modi ne daawa kiya ki jo media main chap rahaa he wo bhraamak he, galat he or kisi tarah kaa koi vivaad nahin hai

 Prashant Kishore commented on Congress President Sonia Gandhi's tweet, saying the Congress leadership is not on the streets on this issue
 iske alaava party ke top netaa bhi CAA or NRC ke khilaaf sangharsh main gaayab dikh rahe hai
 Prashant Kishore said that the Congress can do at least so much that the Chief Ministers of the states where the Congress is in government should come with the Chief Ministers who have said that they will not implement NRC in their states
 bataa den ki ki shuukravaar ko sonia gandhi ne twit kar kaha tha ki naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon bhedbhaavpurn he
 Like demonetisation, once again every person will have to stand in line to prove the citizenship of himself and his ancestors
 PK kii sonia ko salaahsonia gandhi ke is twit paraprashanth kishorane tippanee karte hue kaha, "congress party aaj sadak par nahin he or party kaa top leadership bhi CAA or NRC ke khilaaf aam nagarikon dwaara ladi ja rahi ladaai se bhi gaayab rahaa he
 At least you should ask all your Chief Ministers to join the Chief Ministers of other states, which is against the implementation of NRC in their states
 anyathaa, in bayanon kaa koi bhi matlab nahin he
 Congress is not on streets and its top leadership has been largely absent in the citizens' fight against CAA-NRC The least party could do it to make ALL Congress cms join other cms who have said that they will not allow NRC in their states
 Or else these statements means nothinghttps: / / t
