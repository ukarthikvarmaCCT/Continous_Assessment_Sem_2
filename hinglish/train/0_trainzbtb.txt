 In these days the administration should have said that we have made arrangements for all the villages
 santiya jab kuch din pehle gramin ilaakon ko cover karne gayi thi tab kai gaanvon main logon ne bataaya ki saat saat din par tanker aata he
 That is why there is a fight for the water of tankers
 ab aap khud se yaad kiijie
 At the time of the flood, you must have seen that a packet of relief material is dropped from the helicopter

 At the age of sixty, if someone wants to walk on foot for four hours, then showing the video of water rail in front of his suffering is nothing less than a joke
 kam se kam yah pani kii rail yah bataaye ki iske aane se logon kaa pani ke liye chaar chaar ghante paidal chalanaa band ho gaya he
 a woman from Gujarat was also complaining
 inhone bataaya ki pandrah kimi tak pani ke liye chalanaa padataa he
 You must be really surprised and not believe at all that one has to walk fifteen kilometers for water
 tabhi to ye mahilaayein ain hai aapako dikhaane or bataane ke liye
 Many people got emotional while talking and were also angry

 You know there is severe drought in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh

 On behalf of the state government, it was said that before sending the water train, no one asked the district administration whether water is needed or not
 agar yah tathyaatmak rup se sahi he to kaayade se rajya ko bataanaa to chahie tha
 The UP government says that the railway gave information after the train arrived

 Was the water sent on the demand of mps? kya rail mantralay ne zila prashasan ko pehle soochna di thi yaa nahin

 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something

 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains

 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the

 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Local people told Santia that even before the corporation used to send water tankers at a difference of eight to ten days
 aaj bhi aath se das dinon ke antar par hi pani mil rahaa he
 The administration says that at this time the people of Latur city are getting water at a difference of four to five days
 sookhe ke vakt pani kaa hisaab saamaanya dinon se kaaphi kam lagaaya jaataa he
 According to the current government scale, a man is given 20 liters of water every day
 ek parivaar main chaar log hue to 80 litre pani rose milegaa
 This water is only for drinking and cooking
 das din ke antar se tanker aayega to 800 litre chahie
 But 200 liters of water is being provided by the corporation on ten days
 pani chahie ek glass
 The government is delivering a bowl
 zaahir he sarkaar ke paas samandar to he nahin lekin pani kii rail ko samandar bhi na samajha jaae
 Also understand that the tankers who come in eight to ten days go by giving only two to three days of water
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein prayaas nahin kar rahi hongi lekin aapako samajhnaa yah he ki kya yah prayaas paryaapt he, kitna buniyadi hal he, kitna naam ke liye or kitna dikhaave ke liye
 The water train ran at one place but it is being shown as if it is running in all the drought-hit districts
 santiya ne prashasan se baat kar bataaya ki latur ke kareeb 940 gaanvon main 17 lakh kii aabaadi rahati he

 Water needs a glass
 sarkaar pahunchaa rahi he ek katori
 Obviously the government does not have sea, but the water rail should not be considered as ocean
 yah bhi samajhiye ki aath se das din main jo tanker aate hai wo do se teen din kaa hi pani dekar jate hai
 It is not that governments will not be making efforts, but you have to understand whether this effort is sufficient, how basic is the solution, how much is it for the name and how much to show
 pani kii rail to ek hi jagah chali lekin aise dikhaaya ja rahaa he jaise saare suukhaagrast zilon main chal rahi he
 Santia told the administration that about 940 villages of Latur have a population of 17 lakh
 gaanvon ke liye pani kii rail nahin chali he lekin sookhaa ghoshit hone par 9 charan yani 9 kaam tay kiye gaye hai
 Under this, new borewells are excavated
 puraane borwell kii marammat kii jaati he
 The already existing borewell is deepened
 kuon kii safai hoti he
 Hand pumps are repaired
 asthaayee taur se pani kii aapurti sunishchit kii jaati he
 The Latur administration told Santia by phone that 500 things had been done according to the first seven steps
 aathvaan kaam hota he privet borwell ko kiraaye par lenaa
 The Latur administration has hired 1200 private borewells
 9waan kaam he tankeron ke zariye pani pahunchaana
 The administration has installed tankers for 250 villages with a capacity of 12,000 liters to 25,000
 aapako abhi-abhi to bataaya ki 940 gaanv hai latur main
 There is talk of transporting water from tanker in 250 villages
 itane dinon main prashasan ko kahana chahie tha ki hamane saare gaanvon ke liye intazaam kiya he
 When Santia went to cover the rural areas a few days ago, people in many villages told that the tanker arrives on seven days
 tabhi to tankeron ke pani ke liye maaramaari ho rahi he
 Now remember yourself
 baadh ke samay aapane dekha hoga ki helicopter se raahat saamagree kaa packet giraaya jaataa he
 Many people spread their hands below
 saamaan giraaya jaataa he or kuch logon ke haath lagata he or kuch logon ke nahin
 The helicopter moves forward
 pani kii rail kii haalat bhi yahi he
 It produces amazing scenes on TV but does not quench everyone's thirst
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra dilli ke jantar mantar par gaye
 Farmers from thirteen states have started demonstrations from today
 ye sabhi suukhaagrast ilaakon se chalakar dilli aae hai
 Hundreds of women and men farmers have come here
 aap sabhi ko jantar mantar jaakar in kisaanon se khud bhi baat kerani chahie ki sookhe se unke jivan par kya asar padataa he
 Sushil Mahapatra was shown his palm by an elderly woman from Madhya Pradesh
 mahila ne kaha ki dur dur se pani kaa bartan bhar kar laane se haath main chhaale jaise pad gaye hai
 The woman said that she had to walk for four hours to fetch water
 saath saal kii umr main kisi ko chaar ghante paidal chal kar pani laana ho to uski takalif ke aage pani kii rail kaa video dikhaanaa ek mazaaq se kam nahin he
 At least this water rail should tell that people have stopped walking for four hours for water due to its arrival
 gujarat se ai ek mahila bhi yahi shikaayat kar rahi thi
 He told that one has to walk for fifteen km for water
 aapako vaaki hairaani honi chahie or bilkul yakeen nahin karnaa chahie ki pani ke liye kisi ko pandrah kilometre paidal chalakar janaa padataa he
 That's why these women have come to show you
 kai log baat karte hue bhavuk ho gaye or krodhit bhi
 Well the water rail has gone to another place
 aap jaanate hai madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh ke bundelkhand ilaake main bhayankar sookhaa he
 Today, the central government sent a water train to Jhansi for Bundelkhand
 kisi ne yah tak nahin dekha ki jo tanker jhaansi stesan par khadey hai wo khadey hai yaa nahin lekin raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav refused to take the water train
 rajya sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pani kii rail bhejne se pehle kisi ne zila prashasan se poocha tak nahin ki pani chahie yaa nahin
 If it is factually correct, then the state should have been told by law
 upi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki train pahunchane ke baad railway ne soochna di
 Not only this, the Akhilesh government had asked for 10,000 tankers
 pani nahin
 Water is near the state
 bijepi ne bhi jawaab dene main deree nahin kii
 bjp's Uttar Pradesh president Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government should not do politics on water, it is wrong to return water when the water train is gone
 jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne bhi kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii killat kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya
 Uma Bharti also wrote a letter to Akhilesh Sarkar in this regard, but by evening it was found that the train which has gone to Jhansi is empty
 usamen pani nahin he
 There has been so much ruckus about empty tankers
 tivi channelon par sabake intervyuu chalane lage or jamkar aarope-pratyarope ho gaye jaise sookhe ko lekar matdaan hone vaala he
 Jhansi District Magistrate Ajay Shukla started telling the tankers in front of many people that the train has come empty
 isamen pani nahin he
 While BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that water rail should come, then water should be taken
 uma bharti ne kaha ki bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii kami kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya he
 Both things should be investigated
 kya pani saansadon kii maang par bheja gaya
 Whether the Railway Ministry had previously given information to the district administration or not
 kyonki latur ke anubhav se aapane dekha ki pani kii rail ab ek vijual simbel ban gai he
 It makes a great scene that water has been transported by rail
 dilli ne bhi maharashtra ko pani bhejnaa kaa prastaav diya tha
 Quite a joke and the Maharashtra government refused
 sookhaa to madhya pradesh main bhi he
 The tanker moved to Jhansi from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh
 kya madhyapradesh ke ilaakon main gaye
 Elections are also going to be held in UP
 donon pakshon ne tathyon kaa sahi pataa lagaae bahes ko jan jan tak pahunchaa diya taaki massej jaae ki suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye bada baari kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Drought does not just mean water crisis
 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done
 kisaan kaa karza bad gaya he
 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaaye hai
 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019
 aamir khan maharashtra ke amravati pahunche
 Aamir Khan is holding each other in a mud-filled flat
 yahaan talab kii khudaai kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao have a Pani Foundation
 maharashtra sarkaar ne inke saath bhi milakar ek yojana banaai he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has a scheme called Jalyukta Camp
 aamir khan maharashtra ke alag-alag zilon main ghumkar pani sangrakshan or sookhaa raahat kaa gauge le rahe hai
 Aamir announced the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition during Satyamev Jayate
 isamen jo bhi kaaryakarta sabase adhik pani bachaane main kaamyaab rahegaa use sammanit kiya jayega
 Nana Patekar and Akshay Kumar started talking about helping farmers only when governments were drawing drawings on paper
 masaan film ke nirdeshak niraj ghahvaan or geetkaar varun grover ne apni puraskaar raashi se suukhaagrasta ilaakon main raahat pahunchane kaa elaan kiya he
 Neeraj has received the prize money of 1
25 lakh, out of which he is giving fifty thousand
 varun grover ko pachaas hazaar kii raashi inaam main mili he or wo apni puri raashi de rahe hai
 Varun Grover is the country's biggest industrialist
 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie
 It is in English but this article can help us understand many things
 hamane akaal or bhukhmaree kii samasya par jeet hasil kii he
 For some reason we are constantly ignoring the waste caused by drought
 harsh mandar likhte hai ki aakhir kya baat he ki ham sookhe ke in drishyon ko dekhakar baichaiyn nahin hote
 People do not get angry
 is ek baat par aapke ankar kii duusari raay he
 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this
 ab aap khud se yaad kiijie
 At the time of the flood, you must have seen that a packet of relief material is dropped from the helicopter
 neeche kai log khadey haath failaate hai
 The goods are dropped and some people get their hands and some people do not
 helicopter aage bad jaataa he
 The condition of water rail is also the same
 yah tivi par to kamaal kaa drishy paidaa karti he magar sabaki pyaas nahin bujhaati he
 Our colleague Sushil Mahapatra went to Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 vahaan par teraa rajyon se aae kisaanon ne aaj se pradarshan shuru kiya he
 They have all come to Delhi from the drought-hit areas
 saikadon kii sankhya main mahila or purush kisaan yahaan aae hai
 All of you should go to Jantar Mantar and talk to these farmers themselves about how drought affects their lives
 susheel mahapatra ko madhyapradesh se ai ek buzurg mahila ne apni hatheli dikhaai
 The woman said that by filling the pot of water from far away, there are blisters in her hands
 mahila ne bataaya ki use pani laane ke liye chaar ghante tak paidal chalanaa padataa he
 At the age of sixty, if someone wants to walk on foot for four hours, then showing the video of water rail in front of his suffering is nothing less than a joke
 kam se kam yah pani kii rail yah bataaye ki iske aane se logon kaa pani ke liye chaar chaar ghante paidal chalanaa band ho gaya he
 a woman from Gujarat was also complaining
 inhone bataaya ki pandrah kimi tak pani ke liye chalanaa padataa he
 You must be really surprised and not believe at all that one has to walk fifteen kilometers for water
 tabhi to ye mahilaayein ain hai aapako dikhaane or bataane ke liye
 Many people got emotional while talking and were also angry
 khayr pani kii rail ek or jagah gai he
 You know there is severe drought in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh
 bundelkhand ke liye aaj centre sarkaar ne pani kii ek train jhaansi bhej di
 No one has even seen whether the tankers standing at Jhansi station are standing or not, but politics has started
 upi ke mukhyamatri akhilesh yadav ne pani kii rail lene se manaa kar diya
 On behalf of the state government, it was said that before sending the water train, no one asked the district administration whether water is needed or not
 agar yah tathyaatmak rup se sahi he to kaayade se rajya ko bataanaa to chahie tha
 The UP government says that the railway gave information after the train arrived
 yahi nahin akhilesh sarkaar ne 1 xxrep 4 0 tanker maange the
 no water
 pani rajya ke paas he
 The BJP too did not delay in replying
 bijepi ke uttar pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko pani par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie, jab pani kii train gai he to pani ko waapas karnaa galat he
 Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti also said that BJP mps from Bundelkhand had talked about water shortage in their areas after which water was sent
 uma bharti ne akhilesh sarkaar ko is silsile main ek chitthee bhi likh di, lekin shaam hote hote pataa chalaa ki jo train jhaansi gai he wo to khaali he
 There is no water in it
 khaali tanker ko lekar itnaa bavaal ho gaya he
 Interviews started running on TV channels and there were fierce accusations as if voting was going to be held on drought
 jhaansi ke ziladhikari ajay shukla kai logon ke saamne tankeron ko thok thok kar bataane lage ki train to khaali ai he
 There is no water in it
 jabaki bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki pani kii rail ai he to pani lenaa chahie
 Uma Bharti said that BJP mps had spoken about the scarcity of water in their areas, after which water has been sent
 donon hi baton kii jaanch honi chahie
 Was the water sent on the demand of mps? kya rail mantralay ne zila prashasan ko pehle soochna di thi yaa nahin
 Because from the experience of Latur you saw that the water rail has now become a visual symbol
 iskaa ek shandaar seen banataa he ki rail se pani pahunchaa di gai he
 Delhi also proposed to send water to Maharashtra
 kaaphi mazaaq uda or maharashtra sarkaar ne manaa bhi kar diya
 Drought is also in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam se tanker jhaansi chale gaye
 Did you go to the areas of Madhya Pradesh? upi main chunaav bhi to hone vaala he
 The two sides have ascertained the facts correctly and sent the debate to the people so that the message is that huge work is being done for the drought-prone areas
 sookhe kaa matlab sirf pani kaa sankat nahin he
 There is also a crisis of employment
 kheti nahin hui he
 Farmer's debt has increased
 maharashtra sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki 30 may ko chukaaye jane vaale karj ko ab agle paanch saal tak chukaaya ja sakegaa
 The government will also pay 12 percent interest for the first year
 is par paanch hazaar karod kharch honge
 Atul Devlekar of Latur has conducted a survey in a village
 unhone paaya ki ek gaanv main 55 pratishat parivaar aise hai jo aatmahatya ke kagaar par hai
 They neither have income nor expectation of income
 barish ho bhi jaae to ve kya karenge
 In some places, the government has distributed compensation in drought prone areas per hectare, but this compensation is given only to the owners of the land
 zamin par kaam karne vaale bhoomihin mazaduron yaa gaanv ke anya logon ko nahin miltaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken several steps
 isamen 2019 tak kai gaanvon ko sukhaamukt karne kaa bhi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Aamir Khan reached Amravati in Maharashtra
 aamir khan mitti se bhare tasale ko ek duusare ko pakadaa rahe hai
 The work of digging the pond is going on here
 aamir khan or kiran raav kaa ek pani foundation he
 The Maharashtra government has also chalked out a plan with them
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yojana he jiskaa naam he jalayukt shivi
 Aamir Khan is visiting different districts of Maharashtra to take stock of water conservation and drought relief
 aamir ne satyamev jayate ke dauraan satyamev jayate water cap pratiyogita kaa elaan kiya tha
 In this, the worker who manages to save the most water will be honored
 naanaa patekar or akshay kumaar ne kisaanon kii madad kii baat tabhi shuru kar di thi jab sarkarein kagaz par drawing bana rahi thim
 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he
 All of you should read Harsh Mander's article printed in the Indian Express
 angrezi main he lekin yah lekh hamen kai chizon ko samajhane main madad kar saktaa he
 We have conquered the problem of famine and hunger
 kisi vajah se ham sookhe se hone vaali barbaadi ko lagaataar andekha kar rahe hai
 Harsh Mander writes that what is it that we are not restless seeing these scenes of drought
 logon main gussa nahin aata he
 Your anchor has a second opinion on this one thing
 samasyaon se bhare is desh main har baat ke liye logon kii taraf lautnaa bhi thik nahin he
 The significance of an issue is not fulfilled only when people are excited on a large scale
 zarur logon ko dilchaspee leni chahie or bharat main chal rahi tees prakaar kii sarkaron se poochna chahie
 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced
 agar sarkaar ke paas log kam hai to sarkaron ko naukariyaan badhaakar apni javabdehi puri kerani chahie
 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness
 naitikta ke liye ham logon kii taraf taaken or sookhe se nipatane ke liye bhi
 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems
 log sarkaar chunate hai or sarkaar ko hi netritv karnaa hoga
 The comments bada sawaal he ki kya ham sookhe ke asar ko samajhate hai
 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year
 isliye is baar iskaa prabhaav zyaada gaharaa dikh rahaa he
 Farming is over
 kheti kii sthiti sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Let us not understand that everything will be fine from the next day as soon as it rains in these areas
 55 fisadi pariwaron ke paas zamin nahin he or wo puri tarah shaareerik shram karke apane pariwaron kaa pet paalate hai
 Work is also less in cities
 logon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin mil rahaa he
 Harsh says that 50 million to 80 million tons of grain is loaded in government warehouses
 yahaan tak ki aupniveshik sarkarein bhi aisi sthiti main femin kods se guide hoti thim
 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the
 The government should put more emphasis on MNREGA and a village-wide employment generation campaign
 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi

 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he
 All of you should read Harsh Mander's article printed in the Indian Express
 angrezi main he lekin yah lekh hamen kai chizon ko samajhane main madad kar saktaa he
 We have conquered the problem of famine and hunger
 kisi vajah se ham sookhe se hone vaali barbaadi ko lagaataar andekha kar rahe hai
 Harsh Mander writes that what is it that we are not restless seeing these scenes of drought
 logon main gussa nahin aata he
 Your anchor has a second opinion on this one thing
 samasyaon se bhare is desh main har baat ke liye logon kii taraf lautnaa bhi thik nahin he
 The significance of an issue is not fulfilled only when people are excited on a large scale
 zarur logon ko dilchaspee leni chahie or bharat main chal rahi tees prakaar kii sarkaron se poochna chahie
 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced
 agar sarkaar ke paas log kam hai to sarkaron ko naukariyaan badhaakar apni javabdehi puri kerani chahie
 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness
 naitikta ke liye ham logon kii taraf taaken or sookhe se nipatane ke liye bhi
 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems
 log sarkaar chunate hai or sarkaar ko hi netritv karnaa hoga
 The comments bada sawaal he ki kya ham sookhe ke asar ko samajhate hai
 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year
 isliye is baar iskaa prabhaav zyaada gaharaa dikh rahaa he
 Farming is over
 kheti kii sthiti sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Let us not understand that everything will be fine from the next day as soon as it rains in these areas
 55 fisadi pariwaron ke paas zamin nahin he or wo puri tarah shaareerik shram karke apane pariwaron kaa pet paalate hai
 Work is also less in cities
 logon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin mil rahaa he
 Harsh says that 50 million to 80 million tons of grain is loaded in government warehouses
 yahaan tak ki aupniveshik sarkarein bhi aisi sthiti main femin kods se guide hoti thim
 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the
 The government should put more emphasis on MNREGA and a village-wide employment generation campaign
 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Well the water rail has gone to another place
 aap jaanate hai madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh ke bundelkhand ilaake main bhayankar sookhaa he
 Today, the central government sent a water train to Jhansi for Bundelkhand
 kisi ne yah tak nahin dekha ki jo tanker jhaansi stesan par khadey hai wo khadey hai yaa nahin lekin raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav refused to take the water train
 rajya sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pani kii rail bhejne se pehle kisi ne zila prashasan se poocha tak nahin ki pani chahie yaa nahin
 If it is factually correct, then the state should have been told by law
 upi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki train pahunchane ke baad railway ne soochna di
 Not only this, the Akhilesh government had asked for 10,000 tankers
 pani nahin
 Water is near the state
 bijepi ne bhi jawaab dene main deree nahin kii
 bjp's Uttar Pradesh president Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government should not do politics on water, it is wrong to return water when the water train is gone
 jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne bhi kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii killat kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya
 Uma Bharti also wrote a letter to Akhilesh Sarkar in this regard, but by evening it was found that the train which has gone to Jhansi is empty
 usamen pani nahin he
 There has been so much ruckus about empty tankers
 tivi channelon par sabake intervyuu chalane lage or jamkar aarope-pratyarope ho gaye jaise sookhe ko lekar matdaan hone vaala he
 Jhansi District Magistrate Ajay Shukla started telling the tankers in front of many people that the train has come empty
 isamen pani nahin he
 While BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that water rail should come, then water should be taken
 uma bharti ne kaha ki bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii kami kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya he
 Both things should be investigated
 kya pani saansadon kii maang par bheja gaya
 Whether the Railway Ministry had previously given information to the district administration or not
 kyonki latur ke anubhav se aapane dekha ki pani kii rail ab ek vijual simbel ban gai he
 It makes a great scene that water has been transported by rail
 dilli ne bhi maharashtra ko pani bhejnaa kaa prastaav diya tha
 Quite a joke and the Maharashtra government refused
 sookhaa to madhya pradesh main bhi he
 The tanker moved to Jhansi from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh
 kya madhyapradesh ke ilaakon main gaye
 Elections are also going to be held in UP
 donon pakshon ne tathyon kaa sahi pataa lagaae bahes ko jan jan tak pahunchaa diya taaki massej jaae ki suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye bada baari kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Drought does not just mean water crisis
 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done
 kisaan kaa karza bad gaya he
 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaaye hai
 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019
 aamir khan maharashtra ke amravati pahunche
 Aamir Khan is holding each other in a mud-filled flat
 yahaan talab kii khudaai kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao have a Pani Foundation

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has a scheme called Jalyukta Camp
 aamir khan maharashtra ke alag-alag zilon main ghumkar pani sangrakshan or sookhaa raahat kaa gauge le rahe hai
 Aamir announced the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition during Satyamev Jayate
 isamen jo bhi kaaryakarta sabase adhik pani bachaane main kaamyaab rahegaa use sammanit kiya jayega
 Nana Patekar and Akshay Kumar started talking about helping farmers only when governments were drawing drawings on paper
 masaan film ke nirdeshak niraj ghahvaan or geetkaar varun grover ne apni puraskaar raashi se suukhaagrasta ilaakon main raahat pahunchane kaa elaan kiya he
 Neeraj has received the prize money of 1
25 lakh, out of which he is giving fifty thousand
 varun grover ko pachaas hazaar kii raashi inaam main mili he or wo apni puri raashi de rahe hai
 Varun Grover is the country's biggest industrialist
 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie
 It is in English but this article can help us understand many things
 hamane akaal or bhukhmaree kii samasya par jeet hasil kii he
 For some reason we are constantly ignoring the waste caused by drought
 harsh mandar likhte hai ki aakhir kya baat he ki ham sookhe ke in drishyon ko dekhakar baichaiyn nahin hote
 People do not get angry
 is ek baat par aapke ankar kii duusari raay he
 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this
 bijepi ne bhi jawaab dene main deree nahin kii

 The government and society also have to think on this
 jhaansi ke ziladhikari ajay shukla kai logon ke saamne tankeron ko thok thok kar bataane lage ki train to khaali ai he
 There is no water in it
 jabaki bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki pani kii rail ai he to pani lenaa chahie
 Uma Bharti said that BJP mps had spoken about the scarcity of water in their areas, after which water has been sent
 donon hi baton kii jaanch honi chahie
 Was the water sent on the demand of mps? kya rail mantralay ne zila prashasan ko pehle soochna di thi yaa nahin
 Because from the experience of Latur you saw that the water rail has now become a visual symbol
 iskaa ek shandaar seen banataa he ki rail se pani pahunchaa di gai he
 Delhi also proposed to send water to Maharashtra
 kaaphi mazaaq uda or maharashtra sarkaar ne manaa bhi kar diya
 Drought is also in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam se tanker jhaansi chale gaye
 Did you go to the areas of Madhya Pradesh? upi main chunaav bhi to hone vaala he
 The two sides have ascertained the facts correctly and sent the debate to the people so that the message is that huge work is being done for the drought-prone areas
 sookhe kaa matlab sirf pani kaa sankat nahin he
 There is also a crisis of employment
 kheti nahin hui he
 Farmer's debt has increased
 maharashtra sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki 30 may ko chukaaye jane vaale karj ko ab agle paanch saal tak chukaaya ja sakegaa
 The government will also pay 12 percent interest for the first year
 is par paanch hazaar karod kharch honge
 Atul Devlekar of Latur has conducted a survey in a village
 unhone paaya ki ek gaanv main 55 pratishat parivaar aise hai jo aatmahatya ke kagaar par hai
 They neither have income nor expectation of income
 barish ho bhi jaae to ve kya karenge
 In some places, the government has distributed compensation in drought prone areas per hectare, but this compensation is given only to the owners of the land
 zamin par kaam karne vaale bhoomihin mazaduron yaa gaanv ke anya logon ko nahin miltaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken several steps
 isamen 2019 tak kai gaanvon ko sukhaamukt karne kaa bhi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Aamir Khan reached Amravati in Maharashtra
 aamir khan mitti se bhare tasale ko ek duusare ko pakadaa rahe hai
 The work of digging the pond is going on here
 aamir khan or kiran raav kaa ek pani foundation he
 The Maharashtra government has also chalked out a plan with them
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yojana he jiskaa naam he jalayukt shivi
 Aamir Khan is visiting different districts of Maharashtra to take stock of water conservation and drought relief
 aamir ne satyamev jayate ke dauraan satyamev jayate water cap pratiyogita kaa elaan kiya tha
 In this, the worker who manages to save the most water will be honored
 naanaa patekar or akshay kumaar ne kisaanon kii madad kii baat tabhi shuru kar di thi jab sarkarein kagaz par drawing bana rahi thim
 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he
 All of you should read Harsh Mander's article printed in the Indian Express
 angrezi main he lekin yah lekh hamen kai chizon ko samajhane main madad kar saktaa he
 We have conquered the problem of famine and hunger
 kisi vajah se ham sookhe se hone vaali barbaadi ko lagaataar andekha kar rahe hai
 Harsh Mander writes that what is it that we are not restless seeing these scenes of drought
 logon main gussa nahin aata he
 Your anchor has a second opinion on this one thing
 samasyaon se bhare is desh main har baat ke liye logon kii taraf lautnaa bhi thik nahin he
 The significance of an issue is not fulfilled only when people are excited on a large scale
 zarur logon ko dilchaspee leni chahie or bharat main chal rahi tees prakaar kii sarkaron se poochna chahie
 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced
 agar sarkaar ke paas log kam hai to sarkaron ko naukariyaan badhaakar apni javabdehi puri kerani chahie
 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness
 naitikta ke liye ham logon kii taraf taaken or sookhe se nipatane ke liye bhi
 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems
 log sarkaar chunate hai or sarkaar ko hi netritv karnaa hoga
 The comments bada sawaal he ki kya ham sookhe ke asar ko samajhate hai
 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year
 isliye is baar iskaa prabhaav zyaada gaharaa dikh rahaa he
 Farming is over
 kheti kii sthiti sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Let us not understand that everything will be fine from the next day as soon as it rains in these areas
 55 fisadi pariwaron ke paas zamin nahin he or wo puri tarah shaareerik shram karke apane pariwaron kaa pet paalate hai
 Work is also less in cities
 logon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin mil rahaa he
 Harsh says that 50 million to 80 million tons of grain is loaded in government warehouses
 yahaan tak ki aupniveshik sarkarein bhi aisi sthiti main femin kods se guide hoti thim
 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the
 The government should put more emphasis on MNREGA and a village-wide employment generation campaign
 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Delhi also proposed to send water to Maharashtra
 kaaphi mazaaq uda or maharashtra sarkaar ne manaa bhi kar diya
 Drought is also in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam se tanker jhaansi chale gaye
 Did you go to the areas of Madhya Pradesh? upi main chunaav bhi to hone vaala he
 The two sides have ascertained the facts correctly and sent the debate to the people so that the message is that huge work is being done for the drought-prone areas
 sookhe kaa matlab sirf pani kaa sankat nahin he
 There is also a crisis of employment
 kheti nahin hui he
 Farmer's debt has increased
 maharashtra sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki 30 may ko chukaaye jane vaale karj ko ab agle paanch saal tak chukaaya ja sakegaa
 The government will also pay 12 percent interest for the first year
 is par paanch hazaar karod kharch honge
 Atul Devlekar of Latur has conducted a survey in a village
 unhone paaya ki ek gaanv main 55 pratishat parivaar aise hai jo aatmahatya ke kagaar par hai
 They neither have income nor expectation of income
 barish ho bhi jaae to ve kya karenge
 In some places, the government has distributed compensation in drought prone areas per hectare, but this compensation is given only to the owners of the land
 zamin par kaam karne vaale bhoomihin mazaduron yaa gaanv ke anya logon ko nahin miltaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken several steps
 isamen 2019 tak kai gaanvon ko sukhaamukt karne kaa bhi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Aamir Khan reached Amravati in Maharashtra
 aamir khan mitti se bhare tasale ko ek duusare ko pakadaa rahe hai
 The work of digging the pond is going on here
 aamir khan or kiran raav kaa ek pani foundation he
 The Maharashtra government has also chalked out a plan with them
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yojana he jiskaa naam he jalayukt shivi
 Aamir Khan is visiting different districts of Maharashtra to take stock of water conservation and drought relief
 aamir ne satyamev jayate ke dauraan satyamev jayate water cap pratiyogita kaa elaan kiya tha
 In this, the worker who manages to save the most water will be honored
 naanaa patekar or akshay kumaar ne kisaanon kii madad kii baat tabhi shuru kar di thi jab sarkarein kagaz par drawing bana rahi thim
 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent

 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Drought does not just mean water crisis
 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done
 kisaan kaa karza bad gaya he
 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaaye hai
 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019
 aamir khan maharashtra ke amravati pahunche

 Aamir announced the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition during Satyamev Jayate
 isamen jo bhi kaaryakarta sabase adhik pani bachaane main kaamyaab rahegaa use sammanit kiya jayega
 Nana Patekar and Akshay Kumar started talking about helping farmers only when governments were drawing drawings on paper

 Neeraj has received the prize money of 1
25 lakh, out of which he is giving fifty thousand
 varun grover ko pachaas hazaar kii raashi inaam main mili he or wo apni puri raashi de rahe hai
 Varun Grover is the country's biggest industrialist
 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie

 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai

 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced

 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness

 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems

 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year

 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%

 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken

 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he

 aagaamee film juli 2 ko pregent karne par sensor board ke eks chif pehlaaj nihlani ko sanskari se asanskari kaha ja rahaa he
 Pahlaj has given answers to the questions raised on him regarding this bold film
 juli 2 film kaa tiger jab se relies hua he tabhi se isaki boldnes ke charche chhaae hue hai
 But as soon as there have been reports of being associated with this film, Nihalaniki, since then, everyone has been surprised that while holding the post of Censor Chief, she has become a part of a bold film today
 khud par asanskari hone ke aarope ko lekar haal hi main pehlaaj nihlani ne ek press conference kaa aayojan kiya or juli 2 ke saath judane ko lekar safai di
 i am sanskari and sanskari will be Rehungapahlaj Nihalani said that he is no longer the chief of the censor board so now he can demand a certificate for his film Julie
 unhone kaha ki vah is film ko isliye distribute kar rahe hai kyonki is film main koi bhi bold seen shaamil nahin he
 He said, 'I am attached to this film with its story
 is film kii kahani bahut special he
 This is the 50th film of my career, so i will take full care of this and work with a similar film that takes my career a step further
 pehlajbhole, 'main agar sensor chif hota to juli 2 main koi cat nahin lagaataa kyonki ye ek edlt film he
 Whether it gets u / a or u certificate but i consider it an adult film only
 main sanskari hum, meraa makasad bhi sanskari he or aage bhi sanskari hi rahoonga
 With regard to the bold poster of Julie 2, Pahlaj said in clear terms that the sensuous poster is made only for commercial purposes, i would like to say that do not judge the book by looking at the cover
 pehlaaj ne india today se baat karte hue ye saaf kaha ki unki film ko sensor board se koi kats nahin milane vaale hai or naa hi vah tribunel or riviging cameti main jaaenge
 He said that his film will get an a certificate
 pehlaaj bole, 'jo log sensor board ko filmon kii marketing ke liye istemaal karte aae hai vah unamem se nahin hai
 The disclosure of Nihalani- The government had said that 'udta Punjab' should not pass, but the show moves on from Shahrukh and Salman, not on content, on the question of being disrespectful to the media, Pahlaj said, i have no such thing during my censor board tenure
 The film does not pass, which the family cannot sit together and watch, if there will be such a film, then you call me unreliable
 pehlaaj ne safataur se kaha ki film ke contate kii vajah se hi juli 2 ke saath jude hai
 Pahlaj believes that there is content in the film only when he goes on to speak, show a skin show or Salman or Shahrukh, the film will only run when the content is there
 bataa den ki udata punjab, babumoshaay bandookbaaj sahit kai filmein hai, jinhen pehlaaj nihlani ne ashleel, hinsa ko badhaane vaaleen or samaaj ke liye anuchit bataakar in filmon ke kai seens main cat lagaae the

 Modi today organized rallies to cross Vasundhara Raje's boat in Rajasthan
 bhilwara or baneshwar dham ke baad unhone kota main jansabha ko sambodhit kiya
 In Kota, he said that one of your votes has worked to stop the theft of 90 thousand crores in India every year
 is chori ko samajhaate hue unhone congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal kaa udhaaharan diya
 Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi and the UPA government, the PM said, "when Madam was running the government in Delhi with remote control, the daughter who was not born, in the government papers, she would get widowed and get pension from the government treasury
" 
 jis parivaar kaa astitv bhi nahin tha, uske naam se rashan nikalataa tha or chori kar liya jaataa tha
 'PM Modi said that we have worked to stop this theft
 iske alaava piem modi ne congress ke siem ummidavaar ke chehre par bhi tippanee kii
 He said that the Congress has named its candidate behind the curtain as it does not trust the people of Rajasthan
 modi ne kaha ki jo party aapako siem ummidavaar kaa naam nahin bataa sakati, us par aap kya bharosa karenge
 What Modi said in Baneshwar Earlier, while addressing the rally in Baneshwar Dham, PM Modi said that i will return with your love interest
 unhone kaha ki jab tak atal ji desh ke pradhanmantri nahin bane, tab tak congress ko kabhi adivaasiyon kii yaad nahin ai
 When Atal ji became Prime Minister after so many years of independence, then for the first time Atal ji created a separate tribal ministry
 adivasee mantri banaaya
 Made a separate budget for the tribals and since then the story of development of tribals started
 chunaav se pehle vaade karnaa or phir use bhula dena yahi congress kaa kaam he
 The PM said that within the country, there should be complete arrangement for education for children, earning of youth, irrigation for farmers, medicines for elderly and hearing of people

 Attacking Rahul, the PM said without naming Congress President Rahul Gandhi that he has very little knowledge of Namdar
 ve kailas maansarovar ho aate hai, lekin unhen vahaan ke bare main kuch nahin pataa
 Modi said that during the Congress rule there were only four mobile factories in the country, whereas today they are 125
 modi ne kaha ki jinhen mung or chane main fark nahin pataa ve kisaan kii baat karte hai
 PM Modi said that the Congress has shrunk to such an extent that it has become a mere namekeeper
 congress kaa usul he ki sabase pehle namdaar, phir parivaar, phir parivaar ke darbari or phir vot bank ke thekedaar, phir jatvaad, uske baad unhen desh main koi yaad aata he
 It is a bigger country than ours
 bhilwara main kya bole modiisase pehle piem ne rajasthan ke bhilwara main raily kii
 In the rally, he said that once again the BJP government will be formed here
 mumbai hamale kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki aaj 26 november he
 When Madam's rule in Delhi was run by remote control, when the Congress was in power in Maharashtra, on 26 / 11, terrorists in Mumbai attacked the people of our country and gunned them with bullets
 congress us samay desh bhakthi kaa paath padhaati thi
 Later the same Congress continued to question the surgical strike
 unhone kaha ki congress kii sarkaar main aae din dhamaake hote the
 PM Modi also targeted the statements made by Congress leaders on themselves
 modi ne kaha ki congress ke namdaar mere maa-baap ke baad meri jati par bhi sawaal karte hai
 The PM said that 60–65 years of independence had passed
 congress kii chaar peedi par chaiwale ke chaar saal baari hai
 He said that Modi was not born with a spoon of gold
 usne garib maa ko lakdi ke chuulhe par khaanaa pakaate hue dekha tha
 Therefore, he came and delivered gas stove to 90% of the country's homes
 piem modi ne apni sarkaar kaa kaam ginate hue kaha ki hamaare aane se pehle gaanv main shauchalay kii suvidha 40 pratishat bhi nahin thi
 In 4 years, Modi reduced it from 40 percent to 95 percent
 isko kaam kehete hai
 40% in 65 years and 95% in 4 years
 piem ne kaha ki congress ne kaam kiya he to hisaab bhi dena hoga
 It is believed that people in the state are not happy with Vasundhara Raje, but now the state BJP has the support of PM Modi
 pichley kuch samay main yah naare bhi sunai die gaye the 'vasundhara teri khayr nahin modi tujh se bair nahin' yani ab rajasthan main bijepi piem modi ke chehre par apana aage kaa chunaav prachaar-prasar karnaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why PM Modi has decided to enter the battle of Rajasthan after Madhya Pradesh

 shaadi ke bandhan main bandhe bina pati-patni kii tarah rahane vaale yani liv-in relation main rahane kaa chalan teji se badha he
 The Supreme Court has also given it legal recognition
 indra sharma banaam wikevi sharma ke maamle main faisla sunaate hue supreme court ne kaha tha ki liv-in relationships na aparaadh he or na hi paap
 The decision to marry or not and to have a sexual relationship is completely private
 lihaaja 18 kii umr puri kar chuki ladki or 21 kii umr puri kar chukaa ladkaa liv-in main rah sakate hai
 The apex court has given the legal armor to the live-in, but the live-in partner still does not get the full legal rights that a married woman gets in her husband's property
 iske chalate kai baar mahila liv-in partner ko khaasi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In this regard, Jitendra Mohan Sharma, vice-president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, says that live-in in India is considered a very loose relationship
 shaadishuda mahila ko jitne kanoonee adhikaar milte hai, utane liv-in main rahane vaali mahila ko nahin mil pate hai
 Advocate VK Srivastava says that the first thing is that it is very difficult for people living in live to prove a relationship with their partner
 agar paristhiti janya sakshya (circumstances evidence) yani rent agreement, joint bank acount, partnership bijness ke dastavej yaa phir bylogical child ke jariye liv-in main hone kii baat sabit bhi ho jaati he, to bhi liv-in main rahane vaali mahila ko partner kii sampatti main koi kanoonee adhikaar nahin miltaa he
 However, the woman can claim maintenance allowance from the live-in partner
 mahila liv-in partner ko sirf guzaara bhatta mil saktaa haivike shrivastav ke mutabik gharelu hinsa se mahilaon kaa sangrakshan adhinium-2005 ke tahat mahila liv-in partner bhi shaadishuda patni kii tahat guzaara bhatta maang sakati he
 This claim can only be made if the male live-in partner is alive
 agar purush liv-in partner kii maut ho jaati he, to mahila partner ko guzaara bhatta nahin milegaa
 In addition, under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, crpc, a woman live-in partner can demand alimony
 kaise milegaa liv-in partner kii sampatti main hakasupreme court ke senior edwocket jitendra mohan sharma ne kaha ki agar liv-in main rahane vaali mahila apane partner kii sampatti par kanoonee adhikaar chaahati he, to usko apane naam vasiyat kara leni chahie
 Otherwise, a woman living in a live-in will not get any rights in the property of her live-in partner
 iske alaava mahila ko insurance policy main liv-in partner ke nomini ke rup main khud ko darj karwaanaa chahie
 Jitendra Mohan Sharma also says that through living-in agreement, living-in partner can also get right in the property
 iske liye liv-in main rahane waalon ko register offis main agreement kaa panjikaran karvaa lenaa chahie
 This agreement should clearly specify the property rights
 liv-in main janme bacchon ko milte hai puure kanoonee adhikarliv-in main rahane vaali mahila ko liv-in partner kii sampatti par bhale hi koi kanoonee adhikaar na mili, lekin unki biological santan ko puure adhikaar milte hai
 Under the Hindu Marriage Act, a child born to a live-in gets all the legal rights that a child born to a married couple gets
 unka kahana he ki liv-in se janma baccha apane biological pita kii sampatti main hindu saxeshan act ke tahat hissaa hasil kar saktaa he
 If a woman living in a live-in relationship abroad lives in a live-in relationship abroad, then she gets rights under the local law there
 har desh main isko lekar alag-alag kanoon hai
 More importantly, people living in live-in abroad are very alert about their legal rights
 haalanki bharat main liv-in main rahane vaale log apane kanoonee adhikaar ko lekar kaaphi laaparvaahee baratate hai, jiske chalate kai baar unako dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he

 The question of how PETN, which is said to be one of the world's most dangerous explosives, got inside the assembly is growing in everyone's mind
 vidhansabha kii tristareey suraksha ghere ko bhedakar PETN ko koun andar laayaa, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye ab rashtriya suraksha agency (NIA) cese kii jaanch karegi
 It is almost impossible to penetrate the three-tier security cordon of the UP Legislative Assembly: First Security Level: Actually, people and vehicles inside the first radius are normally checked
 doosraa security leveloadusre suraksha ghere main door frem metal detector lagaakar jaanch karai jaati he
 Third Security Level: On its third and last security level, a check is done with a hand handle metal detector
 iske saath hi vidhansabha parisar main surakshakarmi lagaataar nigaraanee banaae rakhte hai
 Breaking this three-tier security cordon, meeting PETN near the seat of the Leader of Opposition raises big questions
 PETN visphotak kaaphi khatarnaak visphotakon main se ek he
 This explosive is colorless, odorless
 ise metal detector ke jariye bhi dhund paanaa kaaphi mushkil he, lekin dog squad ne ise dhund nikaala tha
 Let it be said that many times the search dogs also fail to detect it
 ise plastic visphot ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he

 In recent times, alert has been issued several times in UP for plotting terror attacks
 vidhansabha parisar main is visphotak ke milane se bade khatre kaa khulaasa hua he
 It is worth noting that in view of the terrorist attack during the Kandar Yatra, a security alert has been issued in 4 states including UP
 khufia input ke mutabik, aatanki bhagava vesh dhaaran kar kaanvadiyon ke samooh par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 At the same time, terrorists can attack kanwadi with any truck or bus
 shuukravaar ko siem yogi ne vidhansabha main is mudde par bolte hue vidhansabha kii suraksha ke liye 11 upaay bataae
 Which are as follows: 1

 2

 3
 karmchaariyon ke liye ek dress ho jisase unki pahchaan kii ja sake
 Only those responsible should be posted in the assembly
 4
 Unnecessary congestion in the assembly will be reduced
 5
 There should be a guideline for the safety of the assembly, which all members and employees follow
 6
 Police investigation should be done on every employee's entry
 7
 Everyone should be investigated, mlas should also cooperate
 8
 There should be police verification of every employee posted in the assembly
 9
 mlas do not come to the house with the phone and if they bring the phone, keep the phone switched off
 10
 Such a system should be made outside, where there is a system of keeping bags and phones
 11
 There is a three-tier system for the security of the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, and measures need to be taken to increase the harmony in it

 The BJP has already engaged in 'mission Kashmir', so that the dream of forming a government in the state can also be fulfilled
 aankadon kii baat kii jaae, to agar ladakh kii chaar or jammu kii 37 siton ko jeet liya jaae, to phir 'mishan 44' bhi puraa ho jayega or kashmir main hindu siem bhi hoga
 The BJP is preparing something similar and BJP president Amit Shah is going to Kashmir after two days to draw its first line
 jammu-kashmir main november main chunaav hone hai
 After assuming the office of PM, Narendra Modi has started paying special attention to Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin is baar dhara 370 kaa zikr kiye bagaiyr target paane kaa khaakaa taiyaar ho rahaa he
 Under this scheme: --- Ladakh's promise of autonomy will be fulfilled
 ---jammu main kashmiri panditon ke saath vikaas kaa nayaa khaakaa khinchne kii taiyaari ho rahi he
 --- In Srinagar, the initiative to join nationalist forces is also beginning
 ---abdulla parivaar or mufti kii siyasat se khafa rajanetaaon ko bhi saath jodne kii pahal bijepi andruni taur par kar rahi he
 But the path is not easy, because the BJP feels that even if it wins in Jammu and Ladakh, it is difficult in the Kashmir Valley, which has 46 seats
 yahi vajah he ki vishesh dhyaan ghati par hi hoga
 Efforts will also be made to make the situation such that it becomes difficult to form a government without BJP

 The session was moderated by India Today TV Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal

 lekin aisa hi kaam aaj netaa kar rahe hai or soshal media kaa istemaal kar apane liye publicity bator rahe hai
 Despite this, it cannot be claimed that a film actor can succeed in becoming a big leader in the country only by films

 Earlier on Tuesday, the Supreme Court, hearing in the IPL-6 betting and spot-fixing case, lashed out at Srinivasan and asked why he participated in the BCCI Working Committee
 Justice T
 es
 a bench of Thakur and Fakir Mohammad Ibrahim Kalifulla questioned Srinivasan's motive, asking, 'on the one hand you say that you will stay away from the decision-making process of the board, while on the other hand you can work through the BCCI through Tamil Nadu Cricket Association Take part in 'court ne shrinivasana se kaha tha, 'aap teen hafte pehle bisisiai kii baithak main hissaa lete hai

 During the hearing, the court had asked Srinivasan, 'you are the president of BCCI, there are allegations against your son-in-law
 aise main sawaal he ki unhen sajaa koun degaa
 We want the BCCI to stay neutral or away from any kind of bias
 'saath hi court ne poocha ki kya yah sahi nahin hoga ki shrinivasana par agle 10 saal tak bisisiai ke chunaav ladane par roak laga dena chahie
 On this, Srinivasan's lawyer Kapil Sibal had said that if the court wishes, an independent discipline committee can also be formed which will also look into the matter of conflict of interest
 is par court ne shrinivasana se kaha tha agar hiton kaa takaraav sahi paaya jaataa he to khel ke bhavishya ke liye ise ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 At the same time, the court said that if he wants to continue as the chairman of BCCI, his investment in Chennai Super Kings will be in danger

 Union Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko 'pijade kaa tota' kahana yaa 'congress beuro of investigeshan' kahana galat he
 Chidambaram asked the CBI to respect the difference between policy making and its implementation
 unhone kaha ki jaanch agency ko nitiyon ko lagu karne tak hi simit rahanaa chahie or nitiyon par sawaal nahin uthaane chahie
 At the cbi's international conference on the issue of 'development of uniform policies to fight corruption and crime', Chidambaram said, "I would like to warn the investigating agency to respect the dividing line between policy formulation and implementation
" 
 " unhone kaha, "jaanch agency kaa kaam aacharan kaa koi niyam tay karnaa nahin he or na hi uskaa kaam aacharan ke kisi niyam par tark karnaa he
 " chidambaram ne kaha ki jaanch agency ko swayan ko keval is baat tak simit rakhana chahie ki kisi niyam kaa ulanghan hua he yaa nahin
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also expressed similar views on Monday and said that it is not right that the investigating agencies should give decision on every policy decision which is taken in good spirit
 bhale hi baad main unhen galat paaya jaae lekin unke peeche koi galat iraadaa yaa nijee maudrik laabh nahin hota he
 Along with this, Chidambaram dismissed the allegations that the central government interferes with the functioning of the investigating agency
 chidambaram ne kaha, "sibiai ko lekar kai myth hai
 It includes the famous adjectives 'pizade's Parrot' and derogatory name 'congress Bureau of Investigation'
 inamen se koi bhi visheshan na to sahi he or na hi arthpurna
 " chidambaram ne kaha, "kuch myth saavdhaneepurvak gadhe gaye or sankeern swaarth ke liye unhen prachaarit-prasaarit kiya gaya
 " chidambaram ne kaha, "halke main main kah saktaa hum ki jab sibiai shaktiyon or adhik swaittata kaa aagrah karti he to aisa lagata he ki yah khud ek asahaay peedit hone kaa dhong kar rahi he
 " chidambaram ne haalanki sibiai ke kaam kii prashansa kii or kaha, "mere vichaar se sibiai duniya kii kisi bhi acchhee jaanch agency kii tarah acchhee he
 We are proud of the achievements of the CBI
 " It is noteworthy that in May this year, in a case related to irregularities in the allocation of coal blocks, the Supreme Court had termed the CBI as 'pizade's Parrot', which 'mimics its owner'

 US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nowart announced this, although she did not provide details of how much of the total funds would be released
 unhone kaha ki yah rakam kaaphi zyada he
 However, the US administration has also said that this help can be given again if Pakistan takes effective action on terrorist network
 iske pehle ek twit main america raashtrapati trump ne kaha tha ki pichley 15 saal main america ne paak ko 33 arab dollar se zyada kii sahaayta di he
 Despite this, Pakistan remains a safe haven for terrorists
 The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools
 They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help
 No more!— Donald J
 Trump (@realdonaldtrump) January 1, 2018 Significantly, its first Trump administration has raised about 25
 5 karod dollar kii sahaayta raashi yah kahkar lataka di thi ki pakistan ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf zyada sakhti dikhaani hogi
