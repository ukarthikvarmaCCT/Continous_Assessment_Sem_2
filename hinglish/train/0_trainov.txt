 ’ is purv bhartiya captain ne kaha ki kohli kii mahanata is tathy main he ki vah dabaav main shandaar pradarshan karata he or team ke hiton ko har cheez se upar rakhata he
 Gavaskar said, 'when India is chasing the target then look at its record
 vah hameshaa unhen match jitata he or yah takat or timming kaa sangyojan he
 Few batsmen have the ability to play with the top and bottom hand
 jab vah top hand ke saath drive kheltaa he to yah shandaar hota he
 He said, 'look at the person's selflessness
 vah apane captain ko strike dekar khush tha kyonki use pataa tha ki captain bhi khud ko sabit karnaa chahta he
 Sometimes when you play such big innings, you want to score a winning run

 Many states have not received GST compensation for three months, before Kerala threatened to go to the Supreme Court against the Center, now 7 states including Kerala are preparing to go to the Supreme Court for the last three months of Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 7 states and union territories are preparing to go to the Supreme Court against the central government if compensation is not received from them
 pehle sirf kerala ne supreme court jane kii dhamkee di thi
 These states have said that if the central government does not provide the immediate dues, then there will be no other way than to go to court
 in rajyon ne di chetavaneekeral, pashchim bengal, punjab, dilli, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh, rajasthan or puduccheri ne kaha he ki unki samasyaon kaa samaadhaan nahin kiya gaya to ve supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 The Finance Ministers of these states have met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week and have urged them to give compensation immediately after August
 gauratlab he ki in rajyon ko har maheene ausatan 7,500 karod rupee kaa muaavja diya jaataa he
 Commercial tax minister TS Singhdeo of Chhattisgarh told our associate publication Business Today that these states are working on all the options first, but if there is no way left, then we have to go to the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha, 'pehle hamane supreme court jane kaa man bana liya tha, lekin ab ham soch rahe hai ki pehle vikalp aajamaa lenge, kyonki aisa hamen supreme court hi karne ko kah saktaa he
 According to an estimate, the Center owes Rs 4,400 crore to Rajasthan, Rs 21,00 crore to Punjab, Rs 2,355 crore to Delhi, Rs 1,600 crore to Kerala and Rs 1,500 crore to West Bengal for the month of August and September alone
 
 pashchim bengal, punjab, kerala, rajasthan or dilli ke vitt mantri ne ek sanyukt bayaan jari kar haal main kaha tha ki yah muaavja na milane se rajya vittiya rup se baari dabaav main hai or centre sarkaar ne isaki koi vajah bhi nahin bataai he
 Significantly, the GST Council is going to meet in New Delhi on December 17-18, in which this issue can be raised
 jiesti concil halaat se puri tarah se waakif he or vah agle maheene apni baithak main jiesti or muaavja ses rate kii samiksha karne ja rahaa he
 The GST Council has acknowledged that demand for compensation is increasing
 concil ne rajyon or centre ke adhikariyon kii ek kamity banaai he jo is bare main centre sarkaar ko upaay sujhaayegi ki jiesti revenue main kis tarah se badhat kiya ja sake
 Why get compensation? Actually, the central government compensates the states for the loss of revenue on items which attract less than 28% GST
 yah muaavja vaise to paanch saal ke liye hi diya janaa he yani 2022 tak, lekin ab kai rajya ise aage badhaane kii bhi maang kar rahe hai
 TS Singhdev says that if GST compensation stops, it will cause a lot of damage to states like Chhattisgarh based on manufacturing

 '(input-bhashaa) While giving the verdict on the Rafale deal, the Supreme Court said that there is no doubt on the deal nor is there any question on its quality
 SC ke is faisle par pratikriya dete hue rajnath ne kaha ki congress dwaara lagaae gaye aarope niraadhaar the
 Hearing the Rafale deal in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice said that there was no doubt on the deal
 rafel kii gunvattta ko lekar koi sawaal nahin he
 We have read the entire process of the deal, the aircraft is the need of our country
 sijeai ne kaha ki vimaan kii keemat dekhnaa hamaara kaam nahin he
 The Supreme Court has dismissed all the petitions regarding the investigation of the Rafale deal
 saamne aayaa congress adhyaksh kaa jhooth: amit shahis maamle par bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne twit kar kaha he, sach hameshaa jeetta he
 The Supreme Court verdict on Rafael has exposed the lies of the Congress President being spread for political gains
 court ko is deal main naa hi koi kharabi dikhi he naa hi is deal main kisi tarah kaa pakshpaat dikhaa he
 In contrast, the SC stated that the government had no role in selecting the offset partners
 isliye is saude ko badnaam karne vaale logon ke makasad par spasht prashn uthaata he, yah bharat ke liye mahatvapurn he
 Truth always triumphs! The Court's judgment on the Rafale deal exposes the campaign of misinformation spearheaded by Congress President for political gains
 The court didn’t find anything wrong with the process nor did it find any commercial favouritism in the deal
 # scnailsragalies — Amit Shah (@amitshah) December 14, 2018 On the contrary SC held that govt had no role in selection offset partners & found no merit in the demand for a probe based on mere perception of individuals
 It therefore raises obvious questions on the motive of those working to discredit the deal, which is important for India
 - Amit Shah (@amitshah) December 14, 2018 Rajnath said - On this decision of the Supreme Court on the baseless allegations made by the Congress, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said - Everything was already clear, but the Congress had made baseless allegations
 siyaasi nafe ke liye janata ko gumraah kiya ja rahaa tha, lekin yah sthiti aaj puri tarah se saaf ho gai he ki jo bhi aaropee congress party laga rahi thi wo niraadhaar the or unamem koi dam nahin tha
 Rajnath said that success cannot be achieved in the political arena even for a long time by throwing dust in the eyes of the public
 hamen vishwaas he ki jo bhi rafel deal hui he vah bahut nishpaksh or eemaandaar he
 Earlier, the CEO of DASO had also cleared the situation completely

 After the Supreme Court's decision, Prashant Bhushan said that on the basis of evidence there is no need for any investigation on the Rafale deal
 court ne saude se judi prakriya or keemton par santushti jataai he, lekin mere mat ke anusaar, supreme court kaa faisla puri tarah se galat he
 They ignored our arguments

 SC disclosed the lies of the Congress, after the decision on Rafale, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that the Supreme Court has supported the government's move by denying any investigation in the Rafale case

 - Sadananda Gowda (@DVSBJP) December 14, 2018 Contradicting Khush Na Ho BJP, SC Anand Sharma of Congress said that the Supreme Court did not comment on many important aspects
 ham ab bhi jepisi kii maang karte hai
 He said that there is no reason for PM Modi and BJP to be happy over the decision of the Supreme Court as the decision is contradictory
 supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki iske vistaar main janaa sahi nahin hoga
 There is no question of apology: Mallikarjun Kharge on this issue, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that in the House today we raised the issue on Rafael, in which we said that the entire matter can be disclosed only if JPAC is formed on it
 hamane rafel kii keemat ko lekar sawaal uthaae the
 Why did the government say that we are putting them in the dock? Kharge questioned that how are the prices of Rafael tripled, we are questioning it, there is no question of apologizing
 hamane isiilie jepisi kii maang kii he
 The incomplete statement being made on the basis of PIL is incorrect
 hamaari maang abhi bhi yahi he ki isapar jepisi bane

 It often seems strange to think that the grievances against which his family had to face embarrassment, he will become the creator of lakhs of people
 lekin deraa sachcha sauda or iske maujuuda gaddinshin baba ram rahim kii asaliyat kuch aisi hi he, or ye ham nahin kah rahe, balki khud saalon-saal saae kii tarah uske saath rah chuke dere ke sadhak kah rahe hai
 The credibility of Sirsa's Dera Sacha Sauda is now undoubtedly tia-panch
 lekin kisi jamaane main ye deraa naa sirf haryana, balki punjab, rajasthan, upi samet aas-paas ke kai rajyon main shraddha or bhakthi kaa centre hua karata tha
 The foundation of this ashram was laid 69 years ago on 29 April 1948 by Saint Beparwah Mastana Ji Maharaj
 log bataate hai ki wo ek pahunche hue sant the, tab se lekar ab tak is dere kii ore se bahut se samaaj seva ke kaam bhi kiye gaye
 But after Ram Rahim's succession, it gradually lost its credibility
 ram rahim kaa janm rajasthan ke sriganganagar main 15 agast 1967 ko hua, wo apane pita maghar singh ke saath dere par jaaya karata tha, jo dere ke duusare gaddinshin shah satnam ji ke shishy the
 But Shah Satnam ji handed over the throne to Ram Rahim at the age of 23
 dere ke sadhak rahe kai log bataate hai ki tisare gaddinshin yani ram rahim ko chunane ke maamle main shah satnam ji se galati ho gai
 Ram Rahim was not only a rasia type of boy from the beginning, but from the days of school, he used to tease girls, harass the people around him
 ladakiyon ke saath chhedhkhani kii vajah se naveen class main gurmeet ko skool se nikaal bhi diya gaya tha
 Due to these antics in the tenth, Gurmeet failed and he came to the compartment, this is Baba's tenth result
 puraane log bataate hai ki jab beparwaah mastaana ji ne dere kii neenv rakhi thi, tab yahaan sachmuch aadhyatmik maahaul hua karata tha, wo apane bhakton ko dharm kii sikh dete or saalon tak lagaataar dhyaan yoga sikhaate rahe, unke shagird shah satnam ji bhi unheen ke nakshe-kadam par rahe
 But gradually after Ram Rahim's arrival, instead of spiritualism, the world was dazzled by the glare, expensive trains, clothes, and things of comfort, and now the dera chief's handiwork has become such that he has to go directly behind bars

 He said, "all of you should have a good meeting together
 " yah ek asaamaanya salaah thi
 The Chief Justice himself proposed to be a potential arbitrator in the case
 unhone kaha, ''nyaayik aadesh se behatar he ki mil-julkar is maamle kaa nipataara kar liya jaae
 "there have been mixed reactions to this
 kendriya samskruti or paryaton mantri mahesh sharma ne ise ''jabardast salaah" qaraar diya jo ''ram mandir ke nirmaan kii raah banayega
 "sharma said the government would prefer to be an arbitrator" in the agreement

 Many BJP leaders, including Uma Bharti and LK Advani, appreciated the court's advice
 janvari ke ant main jari uttar pradesh ke apane ghoshnaptr shloke kalyaan sankalp patrya main bijepi ne vaada kiya tha ki vah ''samvidhan ke daayre main ayodhya main ram mandir banane kii sabhi sambhaavnaaon ko talaashegi
 "the party's proclamation commitment to build the temple hardly allows it or the UP government to become the ideal arbitrator
 adhivaktaa or activist prashanth bhushan ne phone par baatcheet main mana ki ve uljhan main hai
 He said, "this comment is unusual
" yah saarvajanik masalaa he jisamen puraa desh hissedaar he, sirf yachikakarta nahin
 Important principles of law are attached in this and the court should give the verdict instead of talking about any settlement
 " saansad or ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin ke pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ne twit karte hue daleel di ki ''babari masjid kaa maamla jameen par haq kaa he jise elahabaad hycourt ne galati se saajhedaari kaa cese maanakar faisla de diya isiilie apil supreme court main he

 77 acre bhukhand ko teen hisson main baanta tha jisamen do-tihaai kaa niyantran hindu samoohon ko diya gaya or ek-tihaai sunni central vakf board ke naam kiya gaya
 The Supreme Court stayed the verdict in May 2011, terming the decision as "strange and shocking"
 sanyog se vakf board ko uttar pradesh sarkaar anudaan detii he jiske mukhiya ab yogi adityanath hai, jinke purvavarti gorakhnath math ke mahant digvijay nath ne kathith rup se 1949 main babari masjid ke bheetar ramalala kii murti rakhwane kaa intjaam kiya tha
 For this reason, the UP government is in a peculiar situation due to its declared priorities in this matter and some people have asked the Wannf Board to withdraw the case
 is maamle main pakshakaar babari masjid acshan cameti ke sanyojak jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki ''agar vakf board cese waapas le bhi le to duusare yachikakartaon ke hone se cese jari rahegaa
 "jeelani suspects that the out-of-court case will be resolved without the intervention of the Supreme Court
 baatcheet 1986 se hi chal rahi he lekin aaj tak koi santoshjanak samaadhaan nahin nikal paaya he
 Swami has made his point absolutely clear
 unhone samooche vivaadit sthal ko mandir nirmaan ke liye die jane kii baat kii he or muslim yachikakartaon ko kaha he ki ve sarayu nadi ke kinare ek masjid banaakar santusht ho len
 "we cannot change the site of Ram's birth, but the mosque can be built anywhere," he told reporters
 " unhone twitor par likhaa, ''supreme court se 1994 main manjuur ram janmabhumi par pehle se hi ramalala kaa asthaayee mandir he
 There is worship
 kya use koi dhahaane kaa dussahas kar saktaa he?" swami ko supreme court main 31 march ko jawaab dena he
 Bhushan says, "in this case, the country needs a final verdict from the court which cannot be challenged

 sthaneey prashasan or nikaay ke adhikari-karmchaaree awaas dene ke naam par rishwat maang rahe hai
 According to the information recorded in the document, Panditpura is a remote village in Gonda district
 16 prakhand or 1000 gaanvon vaale gonda jile main takreeban 5 lakh kii aabaadi basati he
 Along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's declaration of 'housing to every person', the people of Panditpura also felt that they would get shelter under the PM Awas Yojana, but people were shocked when they got a list of housing

 vajah saaf he kii siddhu badal parivaar kii aalochana karte rahe hai or kah bhi chuke hai ki vah akali dal ke liye campan nahin kar sakate
 This was the reason that the BJP prevented Sidhu from entering Punjab due to Badal's pressure

 Professor Kaushal Mishra is the Head of the Department of Political Science at BHU
 ummid he ki us vibhaag ke chaatro or baaki prophessoron ko shame nahin aati hogi to kam se kam shame kii vartanee aati hogi
 We would not have imagined that this would have been a professor at Mahamana University
 ALTNEWS ke arjuna siddharth ne kaushal mishra ke fasebuk pej ko khangala he
 They have found that they keep spreading many misleading things

 2004 main ujjain kii shipra nadi main snaan kii tasviir ko janvari 2019 main yah kehete hue post kiya he ki ganga main snaan kii tasveere hai
 Kaushal Mishra has also been arrested in 2014 for inciting BJP activists to attack AAP leader
 kab hogi aam aadmi ke mudde par raajnneeti?puraa banaras is uniwarsity se gaurav paata he
 If the power of thinking among the people of Banaras is not exhausted, and the devotion of the leaders is not wasted, then think once for a minute whether a professor should have done such a thing? Do the intellectuals of Banaras also want to be willingly involved in ruining BHU? Before 2014, Banarasi people used to hear the chuckle of Pappu blowing smoke from the White House politics at the tea stall, but what has happened now
 unke banaras kaa professor fasebuk par logon ko uksaa rahaa he
 Is provoking pappu chaay kii dukaan he yaa buddhijivi banaras chhod gaye hai?yahi nahin, karnataka se bijepi kii saansad hai shobhaa karandlaaje

 inhone kai patrakaron kii tasviir ke saath twit kiya he ki hamaara kaam he deshadrohiyon ko expos karnaa

 Ask yourself and our Prime Minister once, why we could not expose Ravish Kumar in five years
 maine twit kar expos kar diya he or ab aap use do ghante kaa live intervyuu de dijie
 Do you still doubt that this work is not being organized in an organized way? ise party ke kaaryakarta se lekar saansad tak kaa samarthan nahin he
 There is no support from pro professors to general supporters
 kya ab bhi aapako shaq he ki amit shah or pradhanmantri modi is tarah kii raajnneetik samskruti kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 The CRPF who came forward to help the Kashmiri students, the troll attacks on my phone, the abuses and threats that have been given to me or the converts, Rohini Singh, Nidhi Razdan, Barkha Dutta on social media have been given at the instigation of these people

 Fear from the supporters to the leaders has ended at the instigation of the government

 bijepi saansad logon ko kyon uksaa rahi hai

 kya ab bhi aapako nahin lagata he ki desh gart main dhakela ja chukaa he

 kya police biechayu ke professor par karrwai kar sakati he? kya police bijepi kii saansad shobhaa ji se puch sakati he ki zaraa expos karne ke pramaan to dijie
 On what basis they have called me a traitor
 chunaav main koun sa paisa kharch hota he deshbhakton ko pataa nahin he kya
 i am told that the Chancellor of BHU is retired Justice Giridhar Malviya
 ve pradhanmantri modi ke prastaavak rahe hai
 Will i be able to do anything with them, whether i have the courage to take action or not, i do not know
 magar justise giridhar malviya ko patr zarur likhuunga taaki mahaamanaa malviya kii aatma ko afsos na rahe ki maine unki viraasat sambhaal rahe unke vaarison ko nahin jhakzora tha
 It will be decided by the soul of Mahamana whether the character who lives in his name was there
 aakrosh jaays he paagalpan nahinvaise meri apil raashtrapati se he
 Chancellors or guardians of universities across India are considered the same
 kya ve professor kaushal mishra ko barkhaast karenge? agar nahin to mujhe behad afsos ke saath yah raay banani padegi ki trol samskruti ko manzuri dene ke maamle main aadarneey raashtrapati bhi jane-anjaane main shaamil hai
 How sad it will be
 kya bharat ke mahaan ganatantr ke abhibhavak raashtrapati ek professor ko barkhaast tak nahin kar sakate? vikalp unke paas he

 is daur main test team ke captain or ballebaaj ke rup main viraat jabardast pradarshan kar rahe the jabaki vanade or tii20 team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ke captain or ballebaaj ke rup main pradarshan main kuch giravat aa rahi thi
 Obviously, in this period Dhoni had to be removed and Virat Kohli was made the captain
 bhartiya team ke kuch cricketron ke kheme se bhi aisi maang uthi, lekin team india ke purv coach gairi karston ne dhoni ko captaini se hataae jane ke bure asar ke bare main chetaya tha
 The comments yah alag baat he ki dhoni ko captaini se hataaya nahin gaya he, unhone khud vanade or tii 20 kii captaini chodi he
 But when there was a demand to replace Dhoni with Virat Kohli as captain in odis and T20s, Kirsten, a former South African cricketer and coach of Team India at the time of World Cup 2011 victory, protested
 karston se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya samay aa gaya he ki vanade team kii kaman viraat kohli ko saunp di jaae, to unhone kaha, ‘aapako mujhase iskaa jawaab 'nahin' milegaa
 You can replace Dhoni at your own risk, because my experience says that all great captains have performed brilliantly till the end of their careers
 ’ karston ne kaha ki agar koi emes dhoni ko jane dena chahta he, to kya pataa bharat britain main 2019 ke vanade worldcup ke dauraan kuch prabhavi match vijayi pradarshan ganvaa de
 Describing 'mahi' as a 'great player', former South African batsman Gary Kirsten lashed out at his critics
 karston ne kaha tha ki jo dhoni kii kshamta par andeh kar rahe hai ve galati kar rahe hai
 When asked about the ongoing debate about the future of MS Dhoni, Kirsten said, 'I am asked this question whenever i come to India
 teen saal main meraa jawaab nahin badla he
 He (dhoni) is definitely the best captain i have worked with and his record in the last nine to 10 years with Indian cricket speaks for it all
 ’ karston ne kaha, ‘mere najariye se isamen koi andeh nahin he ki vah bharat ke mahanatam captainon main shaamil hai or is dauraan nishchit taur par bharat ke liye trophy jiti hai
 ' yah alag baat he ki dhoni ko captaini se hataaya nahin gaya he, unhone khud vanade or tii 20 kii captaini chodi he

 ' 'maahi' ko ‘mahaan khilaadi’ qaraar dete hue dakshin africa ke purv ballebaaj gairi karston ne unke aalochakon ko aade haath liya tha
 Kirsten said that those who doubt Dhoni's ability are making a mistake
 emes dhoni ke bhavishya ko lekar jari bahes ke bare main poochne par karston ne kaha tha, ‘main jab bhi bharat aata hum to yah sawaal mujhase poocha jaataa he
 My answer has not changed in three years
 vah (dhoni) nishchit taur par sarvshereshth captain hai, jinke saath maine kaam kiya or bhartiya cricket ke saath pichley nau se 10 saal main uskaa record sabakuch bolta he
 "from my point of view, there is no doubt that he is one of India's greatest captains and has certainly won the trophy for India in the meantime," said Kirsten

 The left-arm spinner from UP to bowl in Bengal's second innings is Shiva Singh, who was a member of the winning Under-19 World Cup Indian team
 shiva ne crickinfo se kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin he, jab unhone is 'tareeke' se gendbaaji kii
 Shiva claimed that he had tried a 360-degree style against Kerala in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (senior 50-over tournament) last month, which the umpires did not consider wrong
 kuch ko lagata he yah ection puri tarah sahi he, to kai ampire ke faisle ko sahi maanate hai
 UP won by an innings over Bengal in three days, with Siva taking four wickets in the match
 shiva ne kaha, 'main ek divasiy or tii -20 main gendbaaji ke dauraan alag-alag badlaavon kaa istemaal karata hum
 i bowled like this because of the partnership between Bengal batsmen
 lekin ampiron ne meri gend ko ded qaraar diya, main poochna chahta hum ki unhone gend ko ded ball kya kaha?'kya kehete hai cricket ke niyamelite panel ke purv ampire simon tuffel shiva ke maamle main ampire vinod sheshan se jarur sahamat hai

 Under 7 (deliberate attempt to distract / cheat / obstruct intentionally) the umpire is entitled to call the ball 'dead'
 saath hi tuffel kaa kahana he ki yah ampire par nirbhar karata he ki vah kya nirnay letaa he
 But it has to be understood why the bowler did it
 kahin aisa karne kii ekmaatr vajah striker ko vichlit karnaa to nahin thi? duusari taraf agar yah uski saamaanya gendbaaji he, to shaayad iskaa alag parinaam ho saktaa he
 ' rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh chune jane kaa aupchaarik elaan hona hi baaki rah gaya he

 gujarat chunaav or congress adhyaksh chune jane kii gahamagahami ke bich hi uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur ke rahane vaale ayub ali ne chaunkaane vaala bayaan diya he
 Ali says that he had gone to the Congress office at '24 Akbar Road 'in Delhi on December 3 to file his nomination for the post of Congress President
 ali kaa daawa he ki unhone 2 set main apana namakan congress kii chunaav samiti ke adhyaksh mullapalli ramchandran ko saunpa
 According to Ali, he wanted to prove that the accusation put on the Congress to promote racism is wrong and internal democracy is intact in the party
 ali kaa kahana he ki wo ye jataana chaahate the ki congress main sabhi ko baraabar mauka miltaa he
 Ayub Ali says that he was disappointed with the way he treated '24 Akbar Road'
 pehle jab vah riterning officer ke paas pahunche to unako bolaa gaya kiprastaav patr main aap hastaksharkar sakate hai
 But when Ali told that he had come to fill the nomination for the post of National President of the party, all the officers sitting there went to the Chowk
 ali kaa daawa he ki unase kaha gaya ki ye mumkin nahin he
 Only Rahul Gandhi's nomination will be filled
 ali ke mutabik iske baad unke paas maujuud dastavej le liye gaye or congress daftar ke baahar jane ke liye kaha gaya
 Ali, however, does not have any receipt for filing nomination papers
 unka daawa he ki raseed maangane ke baavjood bhi unako raseed nahin di gai or log unako gher ke khadey ho gaye isliye unako vahaan se janaa padaa
 Ali, however, tweeted his picture along with the document while exiting the Congress office
 ali ke mutabik vecongress party ke sadasyhain or 1990 se party ke saath jude hai
 He says that he has also been the General Secretary of Shahjahanpur and Uttar Pradesh Youth Congress
 ali ke mutabik unka maananaa he ki ve sonia gandhi ko apana netaa maanate hai, jab rahul gandhi adhyaksh ban jaaenge to unako bhi apana netaa maanenge
 Ali said so much that he was hurt by the way he treated her
 ayub ali ne kaha ki sonia gandhi meri netaa hai, or kal rahul gandhi adhyaksh banate hai to vah meraa netaa honge
 He said that if Moolapalli says in front of me that i did not give nomination, then whatever he wants will be my punishment
 maine congress ke press haul main namakan diya
 Let the Congress Election Authority make it clear in its press release that Rahul Gandhi is the only person to file nomination papers
 aise main ayub ali kaa kahana he ki agar unka namakan aupchaarik prakriya kii vajah se riject hua to iskaa zikr hona chahie tha magar aisa nahin hua

 punjab ke zyaadaatar sikh shraddhaluon ke paas passport nahingarib shraddhaluon ke liye $20 kii fees jutanaa mushkilpakistan ke kartarpur sthit gurdvara darbar sahib kii ore khadey hokar haath jodakar prarthana kar rahe punjab ke wo shraddhalu hai, jinke paas passport nahin he
 In fact, Pakistan has placed a passport condition for the Darshan of Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara, due to which thousands of people will not be able to pay obeisance to Kartarpur
 aise shraddhaluon ke paas coridor khulne ke baad bhi deraa baba nanak main khadey hokar haath jodakar prarthana karne ke alaava koi ummid nahin he
 75-year-old Jasveer Kaur is one of the thousands of Sikh pilgrims from Punjab who do not have passports
 isliye vah yaheen se khadey hokar darshan kar rahi hai
 Jasvir Kaur says that my husband has a passport and has come twice via Kartarpur Sahib, but now i also want to get a passport
 ferozepur se darshan ke liye deraa baba nanak pahunche ek anya shraddhalu bor singh ji tutanvaale kaa bhi maananaa he ki jab tak passport kii shart lagi he, zyaadaatar log kartarpur sahib nahin ja paaenge
 If the passport is not asked, the benefit of opening the corridor will be said, "we are happy that the Kartarpur corridor has opened
" ham donon sarkaron kaa dhanyavad karnaa chaahate hai lekin ek prarthana he ki jo passport kii shart lagaai he vah sahi nahin he
 Because only one or two members in a family have a passport
 coridor khulne kaa asli phayda tabhi milegaa, jab hamase passport na maanga jaae
 Darshan of the gurudwara should be allowed only on the basis of our Aadhar card and other identity cards
 vahiin kai aise shraddhalu bhi hai jo darshan karne ke abhilaashi logon kaa kharchaa uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin passport kii shart aade aa rahi he
 Sudarshan Singh is one of the 6 pilgrims from Betul and Valsad
 sudarshan singh ne kaha ki ham log har din aradaas karte the ki pakistan main gurudware ke khule darshan hon
 Today our dream is fulfilled
 maine pran liya tha ki main pehle din hi kartarpur ke darshan karuunga
 i had also registered for this
 aaj 10 taarikh ko meraa registration he, subah main yahaan se jaakar kartarpur sahib ke darshan karuunga
 According to another devotee Pratap Singh, Shaikh can pay a fee of $ 20, because instead he will be able to see the gurudwara

 They believe that the poor can raise money for religious travel

 Despite this, hundreds of people are waiting for their turn

 a lot of work has been done on the history of Hindi literature and it has been read and written
 acharya ramchandra shukla or hajaari babu se lekar nae daur ke vishay visheshgyon tak isaki kadiyon ko pirokar ek parimarjeet sahitya itihaas banane kii koshishen hoti rahi hai
 And now another book has been added to this episode
 nai pustak he ‘hindi sahitya kaa itihaas’ or iske lekhak hai dow maan singh verma
 The book is published by Bharat Bharti Prakashan Meerut and a paperback edition of Rs 300 is available to the public
 haalanki sajja or cover ke lihaaj se pustak saadhaaran dikhti he lekin anukram dekhakar isaki vyapaktaa kaa andaaza lagata he
 Dr
 Man Singh Verma has been able to give it shape after many years of effort
 or yah mehnat pustak kii pariklpana or gathan main dikhaai bhi detii he
 In this book, an attempt has been made to look outside the written structure of the history of Hindi literature
 yah pustak sahitya ke itihaas main kuch laapata naamon or vidhaon ko bhi jodne main safal rahi he or is tarah yah adhik samaveshi itihaas kii ore lekar jane main safal pustak he
 Starting from Bharatendu, Dr
 Man Singh Verma adds another name to the tradition of looking at the history of Hindi Khadi dialect
 wo bhaaratendu harishchandra or shridhar pathak se bhi pehle santakavi gangadas (1823-1913) ko apane shodh or tark ke aadhaar par khadi hindi ke pehle kavi ke taur par sthapit karte hai or unako sahitya itihaas kaa hissaa banaate hai
 As far as the book goes, it dives into history and looks forward to it with the same readiness and in this sequence, recognizing the song-ghazal and haiku as the new genres of Hindi writing, they were also given a place in the history of Hindi literature
 is
 itnaa hi nahin, pustak hindi sahitya ke liye apana yogadan dene vaale ahindi lekhakon or kaviyon ko bhi apane main sanjoti he or hindi kii dharohar ko or prasar dene vaale nayakon main in naamon ko shaamil karti he
 The history and history of Hindi literature which has gone through and which has a peek into it, also makes Dr
 Man Singh Verma a part of his history writing
 unhone swatantraaa andolan ke un chehron ko bhi hindi sahitya ke itihaas main sthaan diya he jinhone apane lekhan or prachaar-prasar ke madhyam se hindi ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 The scope of the comprehensive book gives the place of Siddha literature, Nath literature and Jain literature in it, starting from the beginning of the history of Hindi literature
 darasal, hindi ke banane ke kram main inako baahar rakhkar baat nahin kii ja sakati he
 Besides, this book also gives a separate place to the prose literature of Reetikal and explains Braj, Deccan, Khadi Boli prose and Rajasthani prose very well
 khaas baat yah he ki is pustak ko prayojanamulak bhi rakhaa gaya he or saath hi hindi sahitya ke itihaas ko or vyapak daayre main rakhane kii koshish bhi kii gai he
 This helps the students to understand Hindi literature, as well as from the point of view of examinations, this book is very useful
 apane adhyatan hone or apni samagrata ke kaaran yah pustak sangrahntiya he or ise aasaani se apni kitabon kii chayansuchee main shaamil kiya janaa chahie taaki jab-tab isaki madad se sandarbhon ko saadhane main madad mil sake
 a panchayat in Hathapur Parsa in Bihar's Madhubani district issued a Tughlaki decree banning village girls from talking on mobile phones in private
 panchayat ke farmaan ke anusaar ladkiyaan tabhi phone par baat kar sakati hai jab parivaar kaa koi sadsy unke saath maujuud ho
 At the same time, the panchayat has also banned girls from leaving the house at night
 yahi nahin panchayat ne kaha ki bahut jaruri hone par bhi ladkiyaan raat ko ghar se baahar nahin niklengi
 The list of Panchayat decrees is very long
 panchayat ke is farmaan ke anusaar inter tak ke chaatro ko unke mata-pita mobile phone na den
 Apart from this, boys and girls will not dance and sing on the streets of the village on the occasion of marriage
 farmaan ke mutabik jashn manaanaa he to ghar kii charadivari ke andar hi manaaya jaae
 The village panchayat of Bihar is seeing these decrees as an initiative taken in the name of social reform
 panchayat ke logon kaa apane is sandesh ke bare main kahana he ki ladkiyaan akele main mobile par baat karne se bighad sakati hai
 However, the Panchayat has also issued some decrees which are being appreciated
 jaise, koi bhi vyakti agar sharaab ke nashe main paaya gaya to use turant police ke hawaale kar diya jayega
 There is also a complete ban on gambling
 sarpanch ne in farmaanon ko lekar kaha ki gaanv ke logon se vichaar-vimarsh ke baad hi samaaj main shaanti vyavastha kaayam karne ke liye ye nirnay liye gaye hai

 ' The Congress party has also given the task of managing the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year after Punjab to Prashant Kishor
 haalanki is baat kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa hona abhi baaki he lekin agle hafte uttar pradesh ke sabhi netaaon or party padaadhikariyon kii baithak main party alaakaman is baat kii ghoshnaa karegaa
 Earlier, the Congress had given the task of election management of the party for the Punjab elections to Prashant Kishor recently, a press release was issued
 ye ummid kii ja rahi he ki agar prashanth kaa kaam party alaakaman ko in donon rajyon main pasand aayaa to is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki uske baad hone vaale har vidhansabha chunaav or 2019 main loksabhaa ke chunaav prabandhan kaa kaam bhi unhen diya jaye
 But Congress party leaders believe that all this will depend on the election results of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 2017
 punjab or uttar pradesh ke chunavi prabandhan kaa jimmaa dene ke purv party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath prashanth kii kai baithken ho chuki hai
 The comments filhal prashanth kishor bihar main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke salaahkaar hai or chunaav purv kiye saat nishchay ke kriyanvayan main lage hai
 However, close to Prashant Kishore also believes that Uttar Pradesh is the toughest challenge compared to Gujarat and Bihar assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main party ke paas na keval sanghathan kaa abhaav he balki unke paas koi ek aisa cheharaa nahin he jo akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii takkar kaa ho
 However, in Punjab too, the increasing popularity of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in recent times has added to the difficulties for the Congress
 congress dwaara prashanth kishor ko is nai jimmevary se nishchit rup se bijepi ke liye in donon rajyon main mushkilen badhengi kyonki lalu or nitish donon ne bihar vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad mana tha ki bijepi ke saath ek lambe samay main kaam karne ke kaaran prashanth ko us party ko maat dene ke nuskhe dhundne main mushkilen nahin aatin

 Currently, Prashant Kishore is an advisor to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar and is engaged in the implementation of seven pre-election decisions
 haalanki prashanth kishor ke najdiki bhi maanate hai ki gujarat or bihar vidhansabha or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii tulana main uttar pradesh sabase kathin chunauti he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the party not only lacks organization, but it does not have a single face that is a match between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 haalanki punjab main bhi haal ke dinon main aravind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kii badhati lokapriyata ne congress ke liye mushkilen badhaai hai
 This new responsibility by Congress to Prashant Kishore will surely create difficulties for the BJP in both these states as both Lalu and Nitish had assumed after the Bihar assembly elections that Prashant was allowed to work with the BJP for a long time
 There are no difficulties in finding tips to beat
 congress dwaara prashanth kishor ko is nai jimmevary se nishchit rup se bijepi ke liye in donon rajyon main mushkilen badhengi kyonki lalu or nitish donon ne bihar vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad mana tha ki bijepi ke saath ek lambe samay main kaam karne ke kaaran prashanth ko us party ko maat dene ke nuskhe dhundne main mushkilen nahin aatin
 Angered by the rhetoric of rebel Shatrughan Sinha, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has advised him to refrain from rhetoric
 party netaa uma bharti ne to unki tulana congress mahasachiv digvijay singh se karte hue kaha ki shatrughna sinha ko gambhirtha se nahin lenaa chahie
 CP Thakur's rebuke to rebel Shatrughan Sinha: Leave the party, Uma Bharti said on the statement of Shatrughan Sinha, 'his statement cannot be taken seriously
 party kii anushaasantmak ikai is bayaan par vichaar karegi
 Targeting this Bollywood actor, the MP from Patna Sahib said, "shatrughan Sinha and Digvijay Singh are the same
" unki baton ko nazarandaaj karnaa chahie
 Not punishing these statements will be a punishment for them
 'vahiin, party netaa shahanvaj hossain ne kaha, 'party chaahati he ki sabhi netaa anushaasan main rahen
 They should put their thoughts on the party platform
 jahaan tak baat piem kii he to wo bijepi kaa hi hoga
 'significantly, on Tuesday, Shatrughan Sinha had described Nitish Kumar as PM material, and said that there was no question on his ability
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha tha, 'nitish kumaar ne bihar main acha kaam kiya he
 He is eligible for the post of Prime Minister
 unki kshamta par sawaal nahin uthta
 After this, on Wednesday, Bihar BJP leader CP Thakur attacked him directly
 seepi thakur ne to shatrughna sinha ko party chhodane kii naseehat bhi de daali
 He said, 'the party is losing money due to the statement of Shatrughan Sinha
 yah anushaasanheenata he

 The fear that will sting the Commonwealth Games next month but has been knocking for the residents of the capital
 ye khauf he ek chote se dengue ke machhar kaa
 Dengue mosquitoes have already camped in Delhi wherever the games are to be held
 dengue ke marijon kii sankhya hajaar ke paar chale jane se kaise dilli ban gayi he dengue kii rajdhani
 The Commonwealth Games are scheduled to take place from October 3
 stadium or duusare khel sthanon kii taiyaari to bhagwaan bharose hi he lekin vahaan par dengue ke machharon ko dekhakar aap ye bhi kah sakate hai ki khiladiyon or darshakon kii hifaazat bhi bhagwaan bharose hi he
 Alam is that dengue mosquitoes are ready to sting at six sports venues
 dengue ke machharon ne dilli main apana samrajya is tarah badha liya he ki sarkari aspataal bhi biimaar ho gayi hai
 Moreover, the country's largest government hospital AIIMS is also vulnerable to dengue mosquitoes
 kuch duusare bade aspataalon kaa bhi chaalaan cat chukaa he lekin naa to aspataal sudharne ko taiyaar dikh rahe hai, naa prashasan mushtaid he
 Dengue mosquitoes have spread so much in Delhi that in this case, government and private hospitals are also Subhan Allah
 prashasan ne do privet aspataalon kaa is baat ke liye chaalaan kaata he ki vahaan dengue ke machhar paae gayi hai
 The question arises as to why private hospitals that charge you big money have failed to stop these mosquitoes
 bhagwaan naa karen ki aapako kisi privet aspataal main bhartee hona pade
 If ten days remain, then the bill of millions will be paid to you and all this will be in the name of good treatment and cleanliness
 lekin ye jaanakar aap hairaan ho jaaenge ki bade- bade privet aspataalon main bhi dengue ke larva jamkar punap rahe hai
 The challans of two large private hospitals, such as Escort and Holy Family, have been cut by the government and they have been served notices to stop dengue larvae from growing
 abhi ye to jaankaree nahin mili he ki aspataalon main dengue kii rokthaam ke liye kya kiya lekin is khatre kii gunj saat samandar paar tak jarur pahunch gayi he
 Where Canada has provided guidelines for its players to be protected against dengue, Australia is also cautious about the safety of its players
 khilaadi to khilaadi, videshi sailaani bhi dengue se is kadar dare hue hai ki hotalon main 10 se 15 fisadi tak booking radd ho gayi he
 While the rest of the tourists are also asking
 unhen machhar to nahin kaat legaa? or agar kaata to dilli main ilaaj to ho jayega?jis tarah se videshon main khauf fail rahaa he or sarkari agenciyaan sust chaal se chal rahi hai, usamen kahin aisa naa ho ki khel ke mahakumbh main dilli khauf ke saaye main simati najar aae
 How should you not have dengue? Drains are lying open and to destroy the mosquito larvae, who have to spray medicine, they are going on strike
 lekin unki hadtaal rokane ke bajaay emsidi ke haakim-hukkaamon ko bas majaak sujh rahaa he

 ipel ke mukaable main aaj jab indore main kings ilevan punjab kii team rising pune super jaints ke saamne thi to zyaadaatar log pune par hi jeet kaa daanv laga rahe the
 There were reasons behind this
 punjab kaa pichley sijan main pradarshan niraashajanak rahaa tha
 The Pune team was considered to be more balanced than Punjab and his captain Steve Smith is currently in tremendous form
 smith ne mumbai indiens ke khilaaf apni team ke match main aakhri over main do chakke lagaakar jeet dilaai thi
 He scored an unbeaten 84 runs in this match
 tippaniyan Punjab today did really well in both bowling and batting and proved all the projections wrong
 team ne pehle sateek gendbaaji karte hue pune kii team ko 20 over main 163 ran par simit kiya or phir captain glen maxwell ke kamaal kii badaulat match chah wicket se jeet liya
 Maxwell faded the shine of Pune's Ben Stocks' 50-run knock with his strong batting
 maxwell ne keval 20 gendon par naabad 44 ran banaae or pune ke kheme se jeet punjab ke kheme main khinch laae
 David Miller remained unbeaten with 30 runs with him
 swaabhaavik rup se maxwell hi main of da match rahe
 After the win, Maxwell said, "it is good to start with a win
" hamaare liye sijan acha nahin rahaa tha, aise main jeet hasil karke ham khush hai
 We came here with an open mind and we had a plan against every batsman of the opposition team
 ham bhootkaal ko niyantrit nahin kar sakate lekin bhavishya ko jarur behatar bana sakate hai
 We also had a good practice and our team scored around 230 runs in a practice match
 wicket ke pes ko parakhane ke baad score chej karnaa acha sabit hua
 Pune captain Smith, on the other hand, said that the 163-run score was not enough
 wicket bhi duusari pari ke dauraan ballebaaji ke liye behatar ho gaya
 We needed to play with more aggressive accents
 punjab ne aaj vaaki gendbaaji or ballebaaji, donon main behtareen pradarshan kiya or saare anumaanon ko galat sabit kar diya
 The team bowled first and restricted Pune's side to 163 runs in 20 overs and then the match was won by six wickets thanks to captain Glenn Maxwell's amazing
 maxwell ne apni joardaar ballebaaji se pune ke ben stokes kii 50 ran kii pari kii chamak ko feekaa kar diya
 Maxwell scored an unbeaten 44 off just 20 balls and brought victory from the Pune camp to the Punjab camp
 unke saath david miller 30 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Naturally Maxwell was the man of the match
 jeet ke baad maxwell ne kaha, jeet ke saath shuruyaat karke acha lag rahaa he
 The season was not good for us, so we are happy to win
 ham yahaan khule dimag se aethe or vipakshi team ke har ballebaaj ke khilaaf hamaare paas yojana tha
 We cannot control the past but can definitely make the future better
 hamaara abhyaas bhi acha rahaa tha or ek practice match main hamaari team ne 230 ran ke aasapaas banaae the
 Chasing the score after testing the wicket proved to be good
 duusari ore pune ke captain smith ne kaha ki 163 ran kaa score paryaapt nahin tha
 The wicket also became better for batting during the second innings
 hamen or adhik aakraamak lahaze ke saath khilne kii jarurat thi

 a section of the media presented him as if the investigative agency had never shown such readiness before
 lekin sibiai ke kai adhikariyon ko, khaaskar jo agency main 5 dashak yaa usase zyada kaa vakt guzaar chuke hai, unhenchara ghotaale main lalu yadav kigiraftaari kaa vakya jarur yaad hoga
 At that time, the agency had to ask for the help of the army

 Because there were many officials involved in the fodder scam, who were well known to the CM
 ye baat bhi kisi se chhipi nahin thi ki unki vishesh krupa ek se adhik adhikariyon par thi
 After the investigation of this case, the biggest case related to the Chaibasa treasury at that time, Lalu Yadav was charged in June 1997 and he had to resign from the post of Chief Minister
 lekin unhone turant apni patni rabari devi ko shapath dilaa di
 So that he and his family remain in command of power
 is bich CBI jaanch kii kaman sambhaal rahe us samay kejoint diarector upain bishwas ne lalu yadav ko giraftaar karne kaa man bana liya
 He got a warrant from the court too, but he was not getting the support he needed from the government to implement this warrant
 jab unhone police force maangitokuch sipai bhej die gaye
 Frustrated with this, Biswas met SK Saxena, the then state director general of police, and the chief secretary on the night of 29 July, but the matter did not materialize
 duusari ore, lalu yadav ke mukhyamantri awaas ke andar or baahar hazaron kii sankhya main unke samarthakon kaa jamaavada laga rahaa
 Despite this, Upen Biswas did not give up

 Meanwhile Lalu Yadav, who had split from the Janata Dal a few months ago and formed the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 tabakentre sarkaar par unka dabaawais baat ko lekartha ki tatkaaleen pradhanmantri aaike gujral unki pasand se pradhan mantri bane the or wo bihar se rajya sabha main gayi the
 Because of this, some officials of the Central Government and CBI in Delhi wanted that Lalu Yadav should get an opportunity to surrender in the special CBI court and he was not arrested
 lekin vishwaas bhi apni zid par ade the or unhone subah subah komudi or rakesh kumaar ko danapur kaint main brigadier RP nautial se milane kaa aadesh diya or kaha ki sena ko kii madad se lalu yadav kii giraftaari kii jaae, lekinbrigadier nautial ne apane upar ke adhikariyon se baatcheet ke baad yah kahkar apane haath khadey kar die ki sena kaa kaam mushkil ke samay main civil prashasan kii madad karnaa he naa ki police ke badale kisi kaam main bhaag lenaa
 It is worth noting that during the investigation later, Nautiyal admitted that he had phoned a monitoring judge and asked if he had given such orders
 jabaki bishwas or unke adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki monitering bench kaa ye likhit nahin maukhik aadesh he
 Ultimately Vishwas did not get the help of the army and Lalu Yadav surrendered in the CBI court on 30 July as per his wish and the court sent him to jail in judicial custody
 chunki sarkaar unki thi isliye unke aaraam kaa khyaal rakhte hue biempi ke guest house ko vishesh jail banaaya gaya
 Where Lalu Yadav was also running the government
 lekin is maamle par khaaskar sena bulaane kii baat jaise hi media main li hui us samay lok sabha kaa satr chal rahaa tha or is mudde par jamkar hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 The then Union Home Minister Indrajit Gupta announced that a special inquiry was being conducted which would submit its report in ten days
 lekin vartmaan membihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne us samay loksabhaa main bishwas ke is qadam kaa ye kahkar samarthan kiyaaki patna main vidhi vyavastha charmara gaithi isliye unka qadam sahi he
 The task of this investigation was given to RP AP DG, DG Doorai, who completed his investigation in 17 days and recommended action against him besides SP Kaumudi while defying Biswas's move to ask for army's help
 lekin kuch maheene main gujral sarkaar gir gayi or bishwas apane kilaaf jaanch or jo bhi aadesh paarit hua, uske khilaadkolkata hoicourt gayi
