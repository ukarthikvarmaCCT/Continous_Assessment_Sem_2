 haal hi main khabaren ud rahi thim ki abhinetri vidya baalan pakistan kii divangat pradhanmantri benazir bhutto par banane vaali byopic main benazir kaa kirdaar nibhaaengi
 But regrettably this will not be possible because any film on the life of Benazir Bhutto is owned by her husband and her family
 natijan koi bhi filmkaar bhutto ke pati asif ali zaradaari or unke parivaar kii paini nigaraanee ke tale hi yah film banane kaa soch saktaa he
 Significantly, after the assassination of Benazir, in December 2007, Shabana Azmi was to be a part of Benazir's biopic
 is indo-paak production kaa nirdesan mahesh bhatt karne vaale the
 The film was also not made due to the interference of her husband Zardari
 iske alaava sushmita sen bhi bade parde par benazir bhutto kaa kirdaar nibhaane vaali thim
 But the production of this film also had to be stopped
 aise main maujuuda halaat ko dekhte hue yah kaha ja saktaa he ki vidya bhi shaayad ab bhutto ke kirdaar main dikh nahin paaengi
 Why only Benazir recently Vidya refused to be part of the biopic on singer MS Subbalakshmi
 in dinon vidya apni film 'hamaari adhuri kahani' kii shooting khatm karke videsh main akele chuttee manaane ke mood main hai
 Lok Sabha Elections (election 2019) BSP supremo Mayawati will meet Sonia Gandhi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Monday
 mayawati pehle bhi kah chuki hai ki agar unako pradhanmantri banane kaa mauka mila to vah uttar pradesh kii ambedkarnagar seat se chunaav ladengi
 However, another contender for the post could not be happier with this ambition of Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee Mayawati
 hai khabar yah bhi he ki pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) , bispi supremeo mayawati (mayawati) or espi pramukh akhilesh yadav (akhilesh Yadav) voting khatm hone se pehle dilli main hone vaali meeting ko taal sakate hai
 This meeting is to be headed by Congress (congress)
 sutron kaa kahana he, ‘andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidubite hafte bengal gaye the or unhone mamata banerjee se mulaakaat kii thi
 But when he talked about the meeting, Mamta told him, "there is no need for a meeting until the results are reached on May 23
 mayawati kii taraf se bhi nakaaratmak jawaab hi mila
 If you talk about Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee in the race for PM post, then Mamata Banerjee may be trying to become the leader of other parties by giving slogans of non-congress and non-bjp, but now Mayawati is also busy in trying hard equations

 Depends on how we see these events
 lamas kehete hai, 'saachie, jab koi kisi ek ko martha he to ham use kaatil kehete hai, parantu jab koi hajaaron ko maar daalata he to ham use hero kii sangya dete hai
 'although he does not agree to the death penalty on the charges of rape, but it is a matter of law of the country, the country has to think what steps will be right to take after such incidents

 Nevertheless, he says that to get rid of such problems, steps should be taken to reduce inequality in society, correct law and order and increase awareness
 dharm guru kehete hai, haa yah jaruri he ki mahilaon ke liye khaas suraksha vyavastha honi chahie
 But the main security can be education

 This religious teacher of Tibet has always been denied on behalf of China, when he was questioned about this, he refused to answer any political question
 unhone itnaa hi kaha ki vah ab ritair ho chuke hai
 The Dalai Lama said that India would have to find a suitable way to get along with its northern neighbors

 If violence happens today like in the past, it will prove disastrous for both sides

 While giving a message to the young women, Nisha says that instead of getting into the maleistic mindset, becoming independent and deciding her own future should be an inspiration for the society
 naakaami virendra sahvaag kaa peechha nahin chhod rahi he
 Due to this failure with the bat, Sehwag has been out of the Indian team for the past one year
 sahvaag ne bharat ke liye antim test match march, 2013 main khelaa tha or unka antim e-kadivasiy muqabla janvari, 2013 main hua tha
 After this, he has played more than a dozen first-class and list-a matches, but the edge of his bat has not returned yet
 aisi ummid thi ki vijar hajaare trophy (uttar kshetra) ke madhyam se sahvaag apane balle kii chamak waapas paane main safal rahenge, lekin is toornament ke do muqablon main vah buree tarah naakaam rahe
 On February 27, Sehwag was able to score 15 against Jammu and Kashmir at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground, while he scored just 10 runs against Punjab on Saturday
 isse pehle, sahvaag ne beete satr main kul saat ranjai match khele, lekin ek bhi match main unke balle se saikadaa nahin niklaa
 He scored 56 against Vidarbha in Delhi on 14 December 2013, his highest score in the previous Ranji season
 sahvaag ne gujarat ke khilaaf do pariyon main 1 or 15, mumbai ke khilaaf 9 or naabad 35, haryana ke khilaaf 3 or 6, odisha ke khilaaf 0 or 44, punjab ke khilaaf 10 or 12 tathaa karnataka ke khilaaf 32 or 11 ranon kii paariyaan khelin
 Sehwag was dropped from the team due to poor form
 unka sthaan test team main shikhar dhawan ne liya tha or mohali main march, 2013 main shandaar saikadaa lagaaya tha
 Sehwag has not been able to score a single century in the last 10 Test innings, while in his last one dozen one-day innings, only one half-century came off his bat
 sahvaag ke naam test maichon main do tihare shatak or ek-divasiy maichon kii sarvocch vyaktigat pari (219) darj he
 However, due to poor form, the path of Sehwag's return is gradually becoming difficult and at the same time the chances of his honorable farewell are getting weaker
 sahvaag ne test maichon main sabase tej tihara shatak or sabase tej doharaa shatak lagaaya he
 He specializes in playing the most accurate squatter drive, at least on footwork
 unki ankhon or haathon ke bich behtareen talmail he or isi kaaran vah acchhee gendon ko bhi simarekha ke baahar pahunchane kaa madda rakhte hai
 In today's date, this amazing quality of Sehwag is not supporting him and that is why he continues to fail match by match

 How much do your partners love you If a woman is asked this question, it will be a little difficult for her to answer it, because often women spend their love on their partner, their partner is not able to love them that much
 aise main mahilaon ke liye yah kahana ki unke saathi unhen behad pyaar karte hai, unki bhaawanaaon or dil main uthe jajbaton ko vah bina kahe hi samaj jate hai, kaaphi mushkil hota he
 But you don't have to worry
 aaie aapako bataate hai ki kaise aap is baat kaa andaja laga sakati hai ki aap apane partner ke dil ke behad kareeb hai or vah aap par utana hi pyaar lutaate hai jitna ki aap unpar
 Understanding the expressions without speaking
 Your partner understands that without you saying that today you want to spend some beautiful moments in bed with them or you have come home tired from the office and want your partner to give you a hot cup of tea Serve
 aapke saathi ye acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki kab aap unke agosh main khona chaahati hai
 He also pacifies these feelings that have arisen in your mind
 aapaki pasand, naapsand jaananaaapake saathi aapaki pasand naa pasand kaa puraa khyaal rakhte hai
 They know and understand what you like and what you do not
 masalan aapkaa pasandida sangeet yaa phir saathi ke saath bistar main bitaye sunahare palon ke dauraan unki si harakat jo aapako behad pasand he
 Your partner not only takes care of your house but also at home
 aapse kiye vaadon ko nibhanaapake saathi agar aapse koi vaada karte hai, to use puri shiddat se nibhaate bhi hai
 For example, if he has promised to call you at 6 pm or show the film someday and play it without any problem
 aapaki samasyaon main aapkaa saath denaapake saathi aapaki samasyaon ko behatar tareeke se samajhate hai
 We try our best to solve your problems
 aise main agar aap kabhi musiibat main hai, to vah aapaki samasya ko sulajhane kaa har sambhav pyaas karte hai
 Natural men are naturally able to solve problems
 unke paas aapako har samasya kaa hal aasaani se mil jayega
 If your partner has all these habits, then of course your partner not only knows you but also understands very well and lures you with a lot of love

 Today is the last day of nomination for 58 Rajya Sabha seats in 16 states of the country
 isamen uttar pradesh kii 10 siten bhi shaamil hai
 While the opposition has united to win bsp's only candidate Ummidivar Bhimrao Ambedkar, the BJP has made the contest interesting by putting Anil Aggarwal as the 9th candidate
 aise main soobe main ek seat ke liye chunaav hona anivaary ho gaya he
 BJP has nominated Ghaziabad educational businessman Anil Aggarwal as Rajya Sabha candidate as the 9th candidate
 bijepi pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandey ne kaha ki party ke paas 8 ummidavaar jitaane ke baad 28 vot atirikt ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, the victory of our 9th candidate with independent mlas is certain
 bataa den ki rajyasabha chunaav ke bahaane pradesh main vipaksh ekajute hua he
 The BSP cannot win the Rajya Sabha elections on the strength of its 19 mlas alone
 aise main sapa, congress or ralod ne use samarthan kaa elaan kar diya he
 After this, BSP candidate Bhimrao Ambedkar has blocked the 9th BJP candidate in the way of reaching the Rajya Sabha
 8 bijepi, ek sapa or ek seat par muqabalayupi vidhansabha main sadasyon kii sankhya 403 he, jinamein 402 vidhayak 10 rajyasabha siton ke liye vot karenge
 One member needs the support of 37 mlas to win the Rajya Sabha election
 is aankade ke mutabik bijepi gathbandhan ke khate main 8 or 47 vidhayakon vaali sapa ke khate main ek seat tay he
 For the 10th and last seat, 10 additional votes of SP, 19 of BSP, 7 of Congress and 3 others can be won with one candidate
 bijepi ne abhi tak 8 ummidavaaron kaa elaan kiya he, jinaki jeet pakki he
 While SP has made Jaya Bachchan a candidate for the opposition, her victory is also certain
 basapa kii raah main kantebijapi ne anil agarwal ko aakhri din rajyasabha ke liye utarkar basapa ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ke saamne dikkat khadi kar di he
 After the support of SP, Congress and RLD, their victory was now being decided
 lekin ab chunaav hone he
 It is believed that the BJP has made a strategy to fail the solidarity of the opposition by bringing in independent mlas for its 9th candidate
 rajyasabha kaa ganitrajyasabha chunaav ke liye ek tay formula he, khaali siton main ek jod se vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya se bhaag dena
 In conclusion also add a number that comes
 utane hi vot ek sadsy ko rajyasabha chunaav jeetne ke jaruri hota he
 If the example of UP is taken, then 1 in 10 seats is added, then the sum is 11
 ab 403 ko 11 se bhaag dete hai to aata he 36
 63
 isamen 1 joda jaae to yoga hota he 37
 63
 yani upi rajyasabha chunaav jeetne ke liye ek sadsy ko 38 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie
 However, since one MLA has passed away, the Rajya Sabha candidate's victory will be decided here with the support of 37 mlas

 You are busy dating nowadays, but there is a rift between you two
 aap unhen bahut pasand karti hai or vah aapako
 But even then, between you two, there is a tussle between you and they get angry with your words or they stop talking
 aap sochati rah jaati hai ki aakhir aisi kya baat ho gai ki vah itane ukhd gaye
 You will also curse them for their behavior, but what we are going to tell you, you might be surprised to hear that
 ji haa, aap baat baat par naaraaz hone ke liye unhen dosha to detii hai, lekin sach yah he ki aap khud nahin jatni ki purushon ko kya pasand he
 If this is really the case, then know which are the things that your partner does not want to hear under any circumstances
 agar aapkaa saathi aapke figure ko lekar aapse zyada chintit rahata he, to use bhul kar bhi apane vasayukta khaane ke bare main na bataaen, jo aapane kal shaam ko khaaya tha
 No matter how much he asks you about your old relationship
 lekin vah yah kabhi nahin chahenge ki aap unke puraane pyaar ke bare main baat karen yaa kisi tarah kii safai maange
 If you surround him with questions about something in the last month or week, then believe him, he will be clipping to talk to you too
 akasar ladkiyaan ek hi bhul karti hai
 That is, in order to hear his partner praise himself, she asks him to compare himself to another girl
 yahaan tak to phir bhi thik he, lekin jab vah apni hi bahan yaa kisi kareebi rishtedaar se apana muqabla karne kii baat kahati he, to anjaam khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 If your partner ever gets emotional and talks about his future, in which he should also mention the children
 to is halke main na len
 Meaning that he is serious about you
 unki is tarah kii baton ko majaak main na len
 One thing is true that in the boys' minds, along with love, the bayonet's moments are moving around
 lekin kabhi bhi unase is bare main safai maangane kii bhul na karen ki kya vah kabhi kisi or se sambandh banane ke bare main bhi sochate hai

" lekin agar ise khilne ke liye ‘anfit’ qaraar diya jaataa he to is par ek yaa do saal kaa pratibandh avashya lagegaa or board aisa nahin chahta kyonki kotla 2011 vishwa cap ke sthalon main shaamil he
 "accordingly, the BCCI is preparing a document on this entire episode and it will form the basis of its argument that the game was played for 24 overs in this match and only after that the officials canceled the match
 sutron ke anusaar bisisiai is baat ko tarjeeh degaa ki is radd hue match main 130 genden phenki gayi, jisamen se keval saat gend hi upar uthi thi

 Once upon a time Virat had also un-followed Anushka on Twitter
 lekin ant bhala to sab bhala
 Now the situation is that the news of the clarinet of both of them can come anytime
 gujarat main haal main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se mandir-mandir jaakar darshan karne ne bahut surkhiyaan batorin
 There was also a lot of talk of holding the line of 'soft Hindutva' by Rahul and Congress
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan hi rahul ke ‘janeudhari hindu’ or ‘shivbhakt’ avatar bhi saamne aae
 Till the completion of the elections in Gujarat, there was also the hesitation in the Congress that the bets should not be turned upside down
 ye baat alag he ki gujarat main kuch had tak ye daanv congress ke liye kargar rahaa
 In such a situation, the question is whether the Congress and Team Rahul will also pursue the same line of soft Hindutva in the upcoming elections which was caught in Gujarat? After Gujarati, Congress could not get majority in Gujarat but by keeping BJP below 100 seats Surely was successful in giving a strong competition
 congress or team rahul ko lagata he ki gujarat main unki apanaai nai niti kargar rahi or isi ke chalate gujarat main bijepihindutvaka mudda nahin bhunaa saki
 It is also a fact that wherever Rahul went to visit large temples in Gujarat, the Congress was successful in those constituencies
 rahul ke mandir darshan ke sawaal par congress pravaktaa rajbabbar yaad dilaate hai ki prabhaat pheri or bhajan kirthan congress varshon pehle se karti ai he, party ke liye ye koi nai baat nahin he
 Now the question arises here whether the 'grand Old Party' will also weave the strategy of the upcoming elections around the same line that it adopted in the Gujarat elections
 bade rajyon kii baat kii jaae to ab sabase pehle karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The electoral plan for the state will be stamped during Rahul Gandhi's meeting with party leaders from Karnataka next week in Delhi
 20 janvari ke baad karnataka main rahul gandhi kii ore se prachaar abhiyaan ke pehle charan kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 The Karnataka Congress has prepared its proposal for this tour, which will be announced after discussion in a meeting with Rahul
 isamen tarikhon ko lekar hi thode bahut pherbadal kii hi sambhaavna he
 In the first leg of the Karnataka visit, Rahul will visit three big places
 in jagahon ko aise chunaa ja rahaa he ki alag alag virgon ko saath joda ja sake
 Rahul can visit Mysore, Belgaum and Bellary during the first phase
 mysore-yahaan rahul ke chote mote kaaryakramon ke alaava ek bada yuva sammelan rakhaa gaya he
 The city is close to Bengaluru
 technology or yuvaaon ke job ke lihaaj se yuva sammelan ke liye mysore ko chunaa gaya he
 Belgaum - This is the city where Mahatma Gandhi was given the command of the Congress President
 yahaan rahul mahila sammelan ko sambodhit kar sakate hai
 Bellary - This district is dominated by tribals, so it is decided to have a tribal conference on behalf of the Congress
 bellari kaa congress ke liye khaasaa siyaasi mahatv bhi he
 Raising the issue of foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj challenged him in the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 from the same seat
 us vakt bellari ke matadaataaon ne sonia gandhi par hi bharosa dikhaaya tha or sushamaa swaraj ko chunaav main shikast kaa saamana karnaa pada tha
 The first phase of Rahul's tour of Karnataka includes the Sringeri Math, a large religious site related to Adi Vedanta, on the lines of Gujarat
 kabhi rahul kii daadi or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi bhi shrungery math ke darshan ke liye chikmagalore gayi thim
 Indira also contested the Lok Sabha election from Chikkamagaluru
 us vakt indira ke saamne 10 ummidavaaron ne parchaa bharaa tha
 Local Congress workers had also chanted the controversial slogan - "A lioness ten langur, chikmagalur-chikmagalur"
 ”rahul karnataka main bhi mandir-mathon main jaakar soft hindutv kii line ko pakade rahete hai to siyaasi galiyaaron main phir uski charchaa hone ke puure asaar hai
 On this issue, senior Congress leader RPN Singh says, "if a Hindu goes to the temples to seek blessings, then why does the BJP mind
 hindu mandiron main tab se jate hai, jab bijepi kaa janm bhi nahin hua tha
 " duniya kaa har ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ke tamaam recordon ke kareeb pahunchnaa chahta he, lekin is star ballebaaj ke naam par sarvaadhik baar ‘nervas ninties’ kaa shikaar banane kaa aisa record bhi darj he jisko shaayad koi anya cricketer hasil nahin karnaa chahega
 In both Test and ODI cricket, Tendulkar has been out for the most time between 90 and 99 runs
 vah test maichon main das or vanade maichon main 18 baar (ek baar naabad sahit) nervas ninties ke shikaar bane
 In this way, Tendulkar, who completed a century in centuries, could not complete hundreds despite reaching close to hundreds in international cricket so far 28 times
 tendulkar ke is record tak shaayad hi koi ballebaaj pahunch paye, kyonki unke baad rahul dravid (14 baar) duusare number par kabiz hai
 Dravid has said goodbye to international cricket
 jo khilaadi abhi khel rahe hai unamem jaik kallis 13 baar nervas ninties ke shikaar bane hai
 As far as the record of Test matches is concerned, apart from Tendulkar, Dravid and Steve Waugh of Australia also returned to the pavilion between 90 and 99 runs ten times
 vanade international cricket main haalanki tendulkar 18 baar shatak se chook gayi the
 He is followed by Graeme Flower, Nathan Astle and Arvind desilva, who missed nine centuries on nine occasions
 tendulkar vanade main ek baar 96 ran banaakar naabad bhi rahe the
 For Tendulkar, 2007 was a year when he could not score a century on seven occasions
 us varsh vah saat baar nervas ninties ke shikaar bane
 These include six odis and one Test innings
 vanade maichon main to us varsh vah teen baar 99 ran banaakar pavilion laute the jo ki record he
 Apart from this, Tendulkar missed fours in 2000 and twice in 1997, 2003, 2005 and 2011 by scoring a few runs
 mohammad ajaharuddin kii captaini main unka apni pariyon ko shatak main tabdeel karne kaa record acha rahaa he
 While captain of Azharuddin, he became the victim of nervous nerves only three times, while the number of such scores under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid is seven-seven while Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led matches have six
 tendulkar jab swayan captain the tab bhi vah chaar maukon par 90 ran ke paar pahunchane ke baavjood shatak puraa nahin kar paye the
 Apart from this, Tendulkar had to return to the pavilion between 80 and 89 runs a record 30 times
 unke baad kallis (26 baar), bryan lara (22 baar) ganguli (21 baar) or dravid (20 baar) kaa number aata he
 He returned to the pavilion 12 times between 80 and 89 runs in Tests

 jab mughal is desh par shashan karte the, tab kedarnath mandir barf ke pahaado ke tale dabaa hua tha
 It has been 400 years, but not a single brick of the temple has been moved
 agar isse bhi peeche lauten to vikramaditya ke raaj main yahaan aasapaas dhan kii kheti hoti thi
 This information about the Kedarnath temple has come out from scientific research
 kedarnath ghati main research kar chuke jiyologist rabindra kumaar chaujar ke lekh se yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 Read the full article and learn the unknown secrets of the Kedarnath temple
 ‘samudr tal se 11,742 foot kii oonchai par khadey hokar samay kii sui ko thodaa-sa ateet kii ore ghumaakar dekhen to ek adbhut najaara dikhaai degaa: hariyaali main nahaye jangal, chattani dhalaanon kii bhuri kataren, pahaado kii rupahali chotiyaan or shant, manthar gati se bahati mandakini kii laharon ke kinare dur-dur tak faili sunahari hari ghaas ke jangal
 On the map, about 100 meters south of the river, a small dotted figure appears: the Kedarnath temple, which became a witness to the Himalayan catastrophe
 gadhwal ke himalay kshetra par apane 20 saal ke research or kshetreey kaary ke dauraan kedarnath kii nirmal shant chhavi mere man main basii rahi he
 But the valley was not always like this
 yah hakeekat 1991 main us vakt saamne ai jab dehradun ke wadiya institute of himalayan jiyology se vaigyanikon kaa ek dal mandakini ke udgam sthal chorabari glacier par research karne pahunchaa
 Seeing the dark specter of global warming, the Indian government was keen to know about climate change and its impact on Himalayan glaciers
 kudarti jalashay maane jane vaale glacier uttar bharat kii zyaadaatar nadiyon ke pani kaa mukhya strot hai
 The fragments of two verses written in the courtyard of the Kedarnath temple have hidden signs of the nature of the absurd puzzle
 do deevaaron par sanskrit main ukere gaye 20 shloke isaki khubsuurati main chaar chand laga rahe hai
 The two verses carved in 650 and AD 850 merit panoramic views here
 lekin unamem barf yaa glaciaron ke bare main kahin koi zikr nahin
 However, in one verse there is a mention of the area's golden paddy cultivation
 is ghati ne gambhir jalwaayu parivartanon kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karte hue apana vajood kaayam rakhaa he
 Our task was to reconnect the links of the history of the glaciers of this region
 kehete hai ki kedarnath ke is shiv mandir ko mahabharat kaal main paanch pandavon ne banaaya tha
 The exact date of temple construction is not mentioned in any mythological literature
 lekin vaigyanik saakshyon kii kasuti par rakhkar dekhen to isaki umr 3,000 saal se kam nahin baithti
 If there was no sign of snow or glaciers in the region until 850, what does the snow spreading around the temple now say? The answer lies in the lichen: hundreds of years of the combination of fungi (fungi) and algae (algae) Growing slowly, this plant can survive in extremely cold weather
 ghati main glacier ke khisakane ke baad bache chattani avasheshon par upje likene ke adhyayan se hamen beete samay main glaciaron kii gatividhiyon ke bare main jaankaree mili
 We were surprised to find many such proofs that the temple was buried under a giant ice mountain during the period of about 400 years from the middle of the 14th century to 1748
 mandir kii bhitari deevaaron par himandon ke khisakane se, unke patharile or chattani satahon ke gharshan se janme nishaan saaf najar aate hai
 How did the temple cope with the wrath of nature for such a long time? i would say that in the same way today it has faced the floods of the Himalayas
 mandir bahut majboot he
 It is made of wide, massive granite and pillars and stone blocks carved from high-grade "metamorphic rocks"
 sidhe-sade shabdon main kahen to ye aisi chattaane hai jo jameen ke andar dabe rahane ke dauraan garmi or dabaav se apana rup badal leti hai
 They look flaky and are made up of mineral particles, usually from quartz or crystalline
 unamem tej abha hoti he or ve chune par khurdari or bahut kathor lagati hai
 The thickness of the walls and pillars is about one meter
 chat atyadhik majboot he jo ek hi pathar se bani he
 No concrete, cement or iron beams have been used anywhere
 pichley 18,000 varshon ke dauraan prithvi ke vaataavaran main jane kitne badlaav aae: ooshna-nam paristhitiyon se lekar him yug tak
 What we saw in the Himalayas is the result of these changes
 lekin mandir samay kii kasuti par khara utarataa rahaa
 What it is facing today is nothing in front of those 400 years spent inside a mountain of snow
 haa, ek chetavanee jarur he: hamaara sabase bada hit isi main hai ki ham kedarnath mandir kii shanti bhang na karen

 One particular thing about Warner's innings was that as soon as he touched the 63-run mark, he showed his bat to the sky

 partiyon ne bhale hi aadhi aabaadi ko is chunaav main unke anupaat ke hisaab se tikat na diye ho par yahaan sau pratishat mahila jyotishiyon ne netaaon kii kundali vichaar kar ye bataane kii koshish kii ki upi kaa badshaah koun hoga
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's horoscope, Akhilesh Yadav's horoscope, Mayawati's horoscope, Rahul Gandhi's horoscope, what does the planets of his planets say, whose horoscope has Raja Yoga and whose horoscope has low dissolved Raj Yog, calculated by the banner of Kashi Astrology Vidushi Parishad The women astrologers sitting under it did
 kyonki inkaa kahana he ki kundali vyakti ke aaine kii tarah hoti he or uske jivan ke har utaar chadhaav ko grahon kii chaal se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Jyotishacharya Sonali Dixit says that PM Modi, Mayawati and Akhilesh see the Janmak Chakra, since both Mayawati and Akhilesh are having Buddha's Mahadasha
 mayawati ke buddha kii mahadasha main shukr kii antardasha he or akhilesh ke buddha kii mahadasha he wo lagnesh bhi he, to lagn kii dasha shubh maani jaati he, lihaaja sabase badi party ke rup main akhilesh kii party aegi
 But this is only the opinion of an astrologer
 yahaan juty duusari jyotishiyon ke raajnneetik partiyon kii tarah alag-alag mat nikal kar saamne aaye
 Some were also doing the trick of the planets in the parashar method, while some were calculating the number of maths and some of the tricks of the leaders of the world from power
 chunki vidhi alag-alag thi lihaaja grahon kii is chaal main kisi main mayawati aage najar aa rahi thi to kisi main akhilesh, lekin zyaadaatar main piem modi hi apni badhat banaate najar aaye
 Jyotishacharya Anjali Soni, who came here from Haryana, says that Mars and Moon are sitting in the ascendant in Modi's horoscope who are making Balishta yoga, so only Modi government will come
 tippaniyan Women astrologers studied the horoscope of the nets here with their own method using the almanac
 haalanki netaaon kii kundali paane ke liye sabhi ne sahaara google kaa hi liya
 Which planet in the horoscope of leaders was exalted and demoralized, whose vision is retrograde and who is the killer for whom
 isaki gananaa ke baad mahila jyotishiyon kii ye panchayat bhi kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch pai
 Swati Baranwal, general secretary of Kashi Jyotish Vidushi Parishad told that all the female students had gathered here
 bhale hi sabhi jyotish hon or sabhi grahon kii chaal dekh kar hi bhavishya bataa rahe hon par netaaon kii tarah inamen bhi eka nahin he
 And this is also because in the election there is a real astrologer who changes the fate of the leaders with the trick of his ballot
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kundali, akhilesh yadav kii kundali, mayawati kii kundali, rahul gandhi kii kundali, inke grahon kii chaal kya kahati he, kiski kundali main rajyog he or kiski kundali main neech bhang raaj yoga he isaki gananaa kaashi jyotish vidhushi parishad ke binar tale baithi mahila jyotishiyon ne kii
 Because they say that the horoscope is like a person's mirror and every fluctuation of his life can be read by the movements of the planets
 jyotishacharya sonaali dikshit kahati hai ki piem modi, mayawati or akhilesh kaa janmang chakra dekhen to chunki mayawati or akhilesh donon kii buddha kii mahadasha chal rahi he
 In the Mahadasha of Buddha of Mayawati, there is a transit of Venus and it is also the Mahadasha of the Buddha of Akhilesh, if the position of Lagna is considered auspicious, then Akhilesh's party will come as the biggest party
 lekin ye sirf ek jyotishi kaa mat he
 Like other political parties of other astrologers gathered here, different opinions came out
 grahon kii chaal bhi koi parashar vidhi se kar rahaa tha to koi ank ganit se to koi samasaar shaastra se netaaon ke satta main pahunchane kii chaal ko naap rahaa tha
 Since the method was different, in this move of planets, Mayawati was seen ahead in some and Akhilesh in some, but most of all PM Modi was seen making his lead
 haryana se yahaan ai jyotishacharya anjali soni kahati hai ki modi ji kii kundali main lagn main mangal or chandramaa baithe hai jo balishtha yoga bana rahe hai isaliye modi ji kii hi sarkaar aegi
 The comments mahila jyotishiyon ne yahaan neton kii kundali ko panchang ke sahare apni apni vidhi se adhyan kiya
 However, to get the horoscope of the leaders, everyone took the support of Google only
 netaaon kii kundali kaa koun sa grah kiske bhav ko ooncha or nicha kar rahaa tha, kiski drushti vakri he or koun kiske liye maarak he
 After this calculation, even this panchayat of women astrologers could not reach any conclusion
 kaashi jyotish vidhushi parishad kii mahasachiv swati baranwaal ne bataaya ki sabhi mahila vidhushi yahaan ikattha hui thi
 Even though all astrology and seeing the movement of all the planets are telling the future, but like the leaders, they too do not have one
 or aisa isaliye bhi he kyonki chunaav main to asal jyotishi janata hoti he jo apane ballat kii chaal se netaaon kii taqadir badalati he

 This time in the winter season, the weather is not seen as it should be
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki is baar uttar pashchim himalay main mausam kii chaal badali hui he
 December is about to end, but there is no good snowfall in all the hilly areas of Himachal, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir
 super computer ke jariye mausam ke aankadon kii vivechna karne par yah samaj main aa rahaa he ki agle 15 dinon tak yah trend philhal jari rahegaa yani is baar christmas par shimla main barfbaari hone kii sambhaavna naa ke baraabar he to vahiin musuri abhi bhi barf kii safed chadar se marhoom he
 This situation is not going to change on 31 December and 1 January as well
 darasal is baar uttar pashchim himalay ko jhamajham barfbaari dene vaale wedar system nadaarad hai
 According to Devendra Pradhan, the DDGM of the Meteorological Department, this time the western disturbances are coming very weak
 abhi tak is sijan main aisa koi bhi western disturbance nahin aayaa he jiskaa asar jammu kashmir ke saath-saath himachal or uttarakhand main najar aayaa ho
 Along with this, the plains have not yet been exposed to the winter rains after the monsoon
 kisaanon ko thand kaa intjaarpunjab, haryana, uttar pradesh, rajasthan ke tamaam ilaake sitambar ke baad se barish kii raah dekh rahe hai
 This time the weather has changed in such a way that all these areas are getting dry in october-november and December
 khaas baat yah he is baar jaadon ke sijan main din or raat ke taapmaana main bhi waisi giravat nahin he jaisi ki amuman in dinon dekhi jaati he
 There is also a possibility of a decrease in production in all the wheat producing areas of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh due to low cold
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki jab thand padati he to gehun ke paudhe main kopal zyada fatati he or is vajah se gehun main branching acchhee hoti he
 But this time, branching in wheat is weak
 in sabake bich mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he ki disambar khatm hote hote uttar-pashchim bharat ke zyaadaatar ilaakon main taapmaana saamaanya ke aasapaas aa aaenge
 With this, the possibility of common cold will increase in most areas by 15 January
 bhale hi is baar western disturbance kamjor rah rahe ho lekin disambar ke baad inke majboot hone kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, it would not be right to say that good snowfall will not happen this time

 "but i believe that Dear Zindagi" (starring Shah Rukh Khan and Alia Bhatt) is doing quite well, Aamir, who is here in connection with the promotion of "dangal", told reporters at an event here
 ’’ saath hi unhone kaha ki vah film ko kar mukt karne kii maang karenge
 The film is based on the life of Haryana wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat

 a recent study has said that most of the men who watch adult movies are cheaters
 unamem dhokhaa dene kii aadat auron kii tulana main bahut adhik hoti he
 Do you think so too? In today's time, if someone tells you that he has not seen an adult film till date, it can be a little difficult to believe him
 aapke man main turant ye sawaal kaundh jaataa he ki kya aisa sambhav he?haalanki ye study keval purushon ke bare main hi bataati he lekin edltfilmein dekhne main mahilaayein bhi peeche nahin hai
 Women aged 30 to 35 watch most adult films
 ek ore jahaan purushon ko lekar ye aam dharna ban chuki he ki wo nishchit rup se edlt filmein dekhte hai vahiin mahilaayein ab bhi ye baat chhipaati hai
 He believes that if his partner comes to know about this, he will stop trusting them
 yahi baat purushon ke sandarbh main bhi he
 According to the study, cheating habits prevail in men watching adult movies
 isi se judi hui ek duusari study main kaha gaya tha kidhokheybaaj purush ek din main do se teen baar edlt filmein dekhte hai
 According to the English newspaper Times of India, A
 Maralia Gwynn of the University of Central Florida, adult films give options to men
 us ek vakt main use lagata he ki uske paas vikalp hi vikalp hai
 Dhananjay Gambhir, a sexologist and consultant doctor, says that watching porn gives courage to the viewer
 isse wo dhokhaa dene ke liye kadam badhaata jaataa he
 Due to this, their behavior also changes a lot
 aise main edlt filmein dekhnaa or dhokhaa dene ke bich sambandh to ho saktaa he lekin sidhe taur par nahin
 a big reason behind this is also believed that for those watching porn, the intimate relationship is nothing more than fantasy
 aise main real life se adhik unhen phantsi main rahanaa hi pasand aata he
 How to reduce the addiction of watching adult movies? Doctors say that this is not a disease but its addiction is bad
 isse pareshaani ho sakati he
 In such a situation, there is a need to make some rules for oneself: - Control yourself
 edlt filmein dekhne se khud ko roke
 - Remove all media associated with it
 -apane khaali vakt ko duusare kaamon main lagaaein
 -if you are unable to control your habit, seek the advice of a doctor

 If the discussion is a dialogue, but call the gau rakshaks goons, comparative statements like the first toilet of the temple, the murder of the army in Kashmir and the withdrawal of stone pelts, the deaths of young men and farmers on the border every day and the sudden changed economic policies
 Togadia has also talked about thousands of unemployed people

 vicky kaushal mashhoor stant diarector shaam kaushal ke bete hai
 Here are some highlights of the special conversation that took place with him: How was your childhood? i grew up in Mumbai, we lived in 10 / 10 Chawl in Malwani area where there was no separate kitchen or bathroom

 Have you also done engineering? Yes, i used to be a student of science and at that time there was only the option of medical or engineering in studies

 My father has done his MA from Punjab University and his dream was to become a teacher
 lekin ghar kii aarthik sthiti sahi nahin thi, to wo ban nahin paae, phir papa bombai aae, stregal kii or aaj wo mehnat kii vajah se kaam kar rahe hai
 So my father has said that you should not spend time in planning, but should work in today itself
 to aap ejeeniyar bane?ji jab main second year main tha toindustrial visitopar gaya, to vahaan pataa chalaa ki ejineering kii job mushkil he, to maine wo nahin kii
 Since childhood, i was more inclined towards theater and stage
 phir maine khud se puchha ki aakhir main kya karnaa chahta hum, or usee pal maine papa se bhi kaha kii main acting karnaa chahta hum
 Papa said, 'you want to be because i am in the industry, if you are thinking this, then i will not support at all and would like that you become an engineer
 maine kaha ki aapaki stregal maine dekhi he to main us firaaq main nahin hum, bas main wo kaam karnaa chahta hum, jisaki taraf meraa jhukaav he
 After that, the family supported me in this decision and i agreed to act
 pehali baar aapane camera kab phase kiya tha?main 'gangs of vasepur' main assistant diarector tha or pehali baar mujhe clap deni thi
 i also did his rehearsal many times, my hands were trembling a lot that day
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he wo seen manoj sar (manoj bajpeyi) kaa tha or shot number 72 a tha, banaras main shooting chal rahi thi
 i was just afraid that i would not mess up
 us din main bahut hi nervas tha
 So that was my first experience
 masaan ko aap jindagi kii ahm film maanate hai?bilkul, mujhe kabhi bahut bada launch nahin mila
 Just know that people recognize me because of my work and 'masaan' gave me that
 main industry main logon kaa bahut shukraguzaar hum
 You are also doing Anurag Kashyap's next film? i am doing his film Raman Raghav
 anuraag sar se maine bahut kuch siikhaa he 'gangs of vasepur'main kaaphi anubhav mila
 And i used to give a clap in front of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and am working with him today
 main khud ko bahut hi khushnaseeb samajhataa hum
 i have also learned a lot from Nawazuddin sir, when he was roaming all over the city wearing a lungi for Faisal Khan's acting in 'gangs of Wasseypur', he lived the character
 maine navaj sar se hi prerit hokar 'masaan' film ke liye khud kii taiyaari kii thi

 The election campaign in Gujarat ended on Tuesday
 isse pehle bijepi or congress ne apni puri takat jhonk di
 In Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi for the first time held a press conference and raised many questions and tried to surround Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 vahiin, bijepi ke kai mantriyon ne rahul gandhi ke aaropon kaa ek ke baad ek karaara jawaab diya
 During his election campaign in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi had alleged in the press conference that narendramodi has fallen silent on the matter of corruption
 amit shah ke bete se lekar rafel deal main lag rahe aaropon kaa jawaab nahin de rahe hai
 When asked about this, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that we are not making any ruckus on corruption, but those who have committed corruption will be accounted with interest
 rahul gandhi ko uski chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin he
 He said that the answer to each question has been given to the people of Gujarat
 rahul gandhi gujarat main naino factory kaa sawaal uthaate hue yah bhi kaha tha ki naino factory ke liye jameen lagbhag muft main di gai, lekin usase gujarat ko koi phayda nahin hua
 He also questioned the landing on Modi's Sea Plane and said it was an attempt to divert attention
 iskaa jawaab dete hue nakvi ne kaha ki jab gujarat main chunaav prachaar shuru hua tab rahul gandhi kah rahe the ki vikaas pagal ho gaya he
 If development is visible now, those who make fun of development are getting restless
 in logon ko ab janata chun-chun kar jawaab degi
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, while taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi being elected President of the Congress Party, said that Rahul Gandhi has now become the President of his party
 unako pramotion vid out parformens mila he
 Therefore, he deserves double congratulations
 nakvi ne kaha ki jab vah log satta main the tab lagaataar hit wicket ho rahe the
 From corruption to policy paralysis, he was making India infamous in the world
 ab vipaksh main hai to no ball phenk rahe hai
 My advice to them is to play by watching the mood of the pitch
 bijepi ne jis tarah pakistan ke purv videsh mantri ke saath manmohan singh ke dinar ko lekar hamalaa kiya tha
 In his press conference, Rahul Gandhi also raised this point
 lekin us bare main puche jane par nakvi ne kaha ki ham logon ne manmohan singh ke khilaaf koi apshabd nahin kaha
 But the way the entire Congress and Pakistan 's whole family has come to the rescue, it is clear that the pulses are not black, the whole pulses are black
 iske saath hi nakvi ne yah bhi joda ki pakistan kaa sawaal uthaane se pehle unhen yah bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki modi sarkaar ne pakistan main ghuskar aatankwaadiyon ko munhtod jawaab diya tha
 Today nobody in Pakistan's world is listening
 puri duniya modi kii nitiyon se prabhavit he
 No one is listening to Pakistan from Arab country to America
 jab manmohan singh kii sarkaar thi to chote-chote desh bhi bharat ko aankh dikhaate the
 Naqvi claimed that the BJP would have a landslide victory in the Gujarat elections

 The 73-year-old Jiako was admitted to the hospital on October 6 following a High Court order and the hospital has issued a Health Certificate of the former Prime Minister, in which he is deemed fit to serve a 10-year sentence

 Let me tell you that this couple had reached the court to settle the dispute between themselves over the child's surname
 lekin iske bajaae jaj ne unhen bachche kaa pehla naam hi badalane kaa aadesh suna daalaa
 Because according to the judge, only one person's name can be the Messiah and he is none other than Jesus Christ
 maamla america ke tennesi rajya kaa he
 According to the news, the child's mother Jalesa Martin and her father were unable to agree on the child's surname
 donon bachche ke naam ke aage apana-apana sarnem lagaana chaahate the
 The two reached the court of Judge Lu un Belu on Thursday to resolve the quarrel
 haalanki, belue ko bachche ke sarnem se to nahin, balki uske naam maseehaa par hi aapatti ho gai
 The child's full name was Messiah deshawn Martin, but Bell told the child's parents to forget the name of the Messiah and renamed the child to Martin deshawn Mecklog
 is tarah is naam main bachche ke mata-pita donon kaa sarnem aa jayega
 According to Judge Bayley, 'the word Messiah is not just a word but it is a title named after only one person and that is Jesus Christ
 'jab jaj se yah poocha gaya ki un bacchon ke bare main unka kya kahana he jinka naam jijas he to unhone kaha, 'maine is bare main bhi sochaa, lekin yah is maamle main praasangik nahin he
 'the child's mother Martin is surprised by the judge's decision and says that he never thought that he would be forced to change his child's name because of his own religion
 unhone kaha, 'main hairaan hum
 i did not name my child as the Messiah thinking that it is God's name
 mujhe nahin lagata ki ek jaj apni dharmik manyataon ke chalate mujhe apane bachche kaa naam badalane par majaboor kar saktaa he
 'now Martin is looking to challenge the judge's decision

 His latest lapses — if it can be put in this category — are critical comments on Jawaharlal Nehru's foreign policy, which resumed the never-ending Tharoor narrative, and the country's foreign policy establishment and diplomatic seminars

 One reason is that despite becoming a Member of Parliament for the first time, he was installed as the Minister of State
 duusari vajah beshak unka videshi lahaza or paanch sitara jivan style he
 Moreover, the immigrant Indian writer Tharoor managed to get a Congress ticket from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala in the Lok Sabha elections, which caused many people to snake on his chest

 In addition, much of the controversy is related to the confrontation of genres
 south block main yadi junior mantriyon ko apni kursi bachaae rakhni ho to munh ko band rakhana hota he, lekin tharur to duusari hi mitti ke bane hai, or duusari hi saanskrithik prishthbhumi se sarokaar rakhte hai, or yahi samasya kii jad he

 si
 Singh says, "the United Nations coming from a highly cultured elite environment should have given some time to identify with the functioning of the political realm, but their repeated confrontations and aggressive attacks one after the other have left character flaws

 Though there is a clear division of duties in the protocol-driven ministry, Tharoor has been speaking out loudly on issues not covered by his agenda, including the issue of relations with Pakistan
 lekin tharur jor-shor se apana bachaav karte hai, ''videsh niti par maine jo bhi tippaniyan kii hai, ve jimmedaar adhikariyon dwaara muhaiyaa karai gai brifing par shaamil hai, jinhen khaas taur se aise sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye mantriyon ko taiyaar karne ke liye hi banaaya jaataa he
 Although the responsibilities of the State Ministers are clearly fixed, it would be irresponsible for them to remain ignorant of significant changes in the country's foreign relations
 maine loksabhaa main afghanistan par chah sawaalon ke jawaab die, yah aadhikarik taur par mere kaaryakshetra main nahin aata
 Should it be termed as unauthorized entry into other's jurisdiction or an unprofessional attitude? "tharoor's tenure as Minister of State for External Affairs is a matter of lengthening his height from his chair in a short span of time

Not only did your support give me strength, but the hope that we can create a clean model of election funding in India (4 / 4)— Atishi (@atishiaap)may 23, 2019 The Bharatiya Janata Party's ally Shiv Sena has praised the Maharashtra government for farmers' loan waiver
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main shivasena ne fadanvis sarkaar kii kisaanon kii karj maafee ke liye tarif kii he
 It has been written in the face that the way the state government negotiated with all the leaders of the opposition and other parties to find a way out for farmer loan waiver, it is praiseworthy
 kisaan sarkaar kii sadaiv rini rahenge
 However, in the editorial, the Chief Minister also criticized the Chief Minister for worrying about the burden of debt waiver on the state government
 iske alaava shivasena ne sampadakeey main congress-ensipi par bhi kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa shrey lene ke liye bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 In the editorial, the Shiv Sena said that Shiv Sena supported the debt-free demand of the farmers of Maharashtra and pledged to get the debt redemption, which Shiv Sena vied with its government to fulfill but Shiv Sena fulfilled it
 karj maafee se rajya ke 90 lakh kisaanon ko phayda milegaa jabaki 40 lakh kisaan is karj maafee se vanchit rah jaaenge
 Such farmers will also get justice by putting pressure on the Shiv Sena government
 sampadakeey main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne maharashtra main chale kisaan andolan ke dauraan kisaanon par darj maamalon ko peeche lene ke liye sarkaar kaa kya karnaa he shivasena dekhegi aisa vachan diya
 In the editorial, Chief Minister Fadnavis reprimanded the farmers' debt waiver over the government's burden of Rs 35 thousand crore
 shivasena ne kaha ki rajya main kisaanon kii aatmahatya rokane ke liye yah karj maafee kuch bhi nahin
 In the editorial, Shiv Sena said that more than money is the value of public life for running the state
 roj marane waalon kii sankhya badhane lagi to kya sarkaar murdon par raaj karegi?? uddhav ne sampadakeey main mukhyamantri ko kisaanon kii karj maafee se padane vaale boj ko kam karne ke liye badi pariyojnaon ko radd karne or vidhayakon, saansadon, vartmaan or purv mantri, mahanagarapalika sadasyon se sahyog lene kii salaah di
 In an editorial, Uddhav replied to those questioning the debt waiver of farmers and called it fashion, saying that this fight for Shiv Sena was about the future and life-death of farmers and their children

 After scoring 63 off 33 balls against Chennai, he played a stormy innings of 104 not out in 63 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad
 38 saal ke gail jis maarak form main hai, usase to aisa lagata he ki vah kabhi bhi, kisi bhi gendbaaj ko 'khilonaa' bana sakate hai
 In the 16th match of the current IPL, he targeted Afghan leg-spinner Rashid Khan and hit 4 consecutive sixes in the 14th over of the innings
 mohali kii tufaani shatkeey pari ko gail ne kiya beti ke namrashid khan ne us over main kul 27 ran lutaae, jo ipel kariyar main unka sabase mahangaa over rahaa
 Talking about T20, South African legend AB de Villiers has hit a total of four sixes in an over before Gayle
 2016 main tii-20 world cap ke south africa-afghanistan match ke dauraan pari ke 17wein over main divilliars ne 29 ran luute the
 Then he hit Rashid's balls like this - 6, 4, 6, 6, 6,1
 maujuuda ipel ke pehle shatakaveer kris gail ne apni pari main 11 chakke lagaae
 Talk of hitting more than 10 sixes in an innings of T20, Gayle has done this feat for the 16th time
 brendan makkulam, dasun shanaka, ivin louis or andre rasel 2-2 baar hi aisa kar paae hai
 The first century of this IPL, Gayle was unsuccessful in the 2011 IPL Auction of Preeti, who was selected in rcb's team as a replacement for injured Dirk Naines
 iske baad unhone apni puraani team kolkata nite rides ke khilaaf shatak jadkar badla liya tha
 This time, Gayle was unsold in the first two rounds in the IPL auction, after this, Kings XI took advantage of the opportunity and did not let Gayle get out of hand and got two crores of his purse

 Red sand boa is being smuggled in South Gujarat and Mumbai these days
 aam bol chaal main ise domuha saanp bhi kehete hai
 Recently, Navi Mumbai Police arrested three people and recovered four red sand boas, which have a market value of more than five crore rupees
 police ko khufia jaankaree mili thi ki kuch log boa kaa sauda karne aa rahe hai, usne jaal bichaaya or khaarghar ke paas teen sandigdhon ko poochtacha ke liye unke bag kii talaashi lene par usamen chaar red sand boa mili
 According to Crime Branch Inspector Sunil Bajare, three men near Little Mall in Kharghar met an agent to deal with the snakes, but were caught red handed
 unke bag se chaar domunhe saanp, dawa or kai syrinj mili
 After injecting these snakes, their weight increases, which determines their price
 pakade gaye aropiyon ke naam hai - firoz rasul khan, rohit om prakaash mishra or anil kishor jadhav
 According to the police, there is a possibility that the wires of these people are connected to an international racket
 is bare main jaanch chal rahi he
 Experts say that Boa's perch is the highest in Gujarat
 ye gujarat ke surat, tapi, valsad or vaapi ke alaava dadar or nagar haveli main paae jate hai
 Apart from this, this snake-colored snake is also inhabited in the plains and marshy parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh border, Tamil Nadu and north-eastern areas
 kaha jaataa he ki boa jitna motaa hoga, uski keemat bhi utani zyada hogi
 According to the police, these snakes, which have become extremely rare, are being sold in the world of smugglers according to their weight and they also have a rate cord
 250 gram kaa boa 2-5 lakh rupaya main, jabaki 500 gram kaa 8-10 lakh rupee main bikta he
 a kg of boa can cost up to Rs 1 crore, while a two kg boa sells for Rs 3-5 crore
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki rate cord ke chakkar main in bejubaanon kaa vajan injection dekar badhaayaa jaataa he
 Actually the Boa smugglers also redeem the beliefs associated with it
 agar ghar ke aasapaas boa dikh gaya, to desh ke kai ilaakon main ise shubh sanket mana jaataa he
 In many states of the south, it is kept in pot and is believed to yield money
 manyata ghar kii tarakkee se judi he, isliye jaharila nahin hone se log ise paalane se darate nahin
 Not only this, if it is brought up, then another source of income also opens
 puja ke liye log ise kiraaye par bhi lagaate hai or paise ghante ke hisaab se milte hai
 On the other hand, such cases are also no less, when this split is offered and this recognition is associated with black magic
 ek jaankaree ke mutabik dakshin asian deshon main isse takat kii goliyaan bhi banaai jaati hai
 It is also being tried in research of some new medicines
 animal welfare board of india ke sadsy leftinent karnal jesi khanna ke mutabik kai dawaaen banane main red sand boa kaa istemaal ho rahaa he
 Their demand has increased in countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia
 boa na jaharila hota he, na gussell
 The average lifespan of this snake longer than about one meter is 15–20 years
 boa kii khaasiyat he isaki poonch, jo munh kii tarah dikhti he, isliye ise domuha saanp bhi kaha jaataa he
 These snakes are also reared in many countries of South Asia, but due to their need in medicine and research, they are also being hunted in large numbers
 is do munh ke liye is bejubaan ko bahut takalif di jaati he or uski poonch ko jalaakar usamen mom bharaa jaataa he or use ankhon kii shakl di jaati he, taaki boa ko domuha bataaya ja sake
 Predators have placed the boa in the category of extinct species in greed

 ' The bill related to illegal colonies of Delhi passed in Lok Sabha, 40 lakh residents of Delhi will be benefited by this bill, introduced by Lok Sabha Minister Hardeep Singh Puri in Lok Sabha, it was brought to the Lok Sabha on Thursday as a solution to a problem related to Delhi
 The bill was passed by voice vote
 yah vidheyak dilli kii anadhikrut coloniyon se judaa hua tha
 Through this bill, arrangements have been made to give ownership of their property to the people living in those colonies
 is vidheyak se dilli ke 40 lakh nivaasiyon ko phayda milane kii ummid he
 Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development, Hardeep Singh Puri introduced the National Capital Territory of Delhi (unauthorized Colony Residential Property Rights Recognition) Bill, 2019 in the Lok Sabha
 jiske baad is vidheyak par vistrut charchaa hui
 During the discussion there was a lot of ruckus, for this the time of the House was also extended, finally this bill was passed by voice vote
 charchaa ke dauraan nadaarad rahe hansraj hans or gautam gambhirajis vakt dilli kii avaidh coloniyon ko niyamit karne ke bill par loksabhaa main badi charchaa chal rahi thi
 At that time, two out of seven mps from Delhi were not present in the House
 sadan main sirf dow
 Harsh Vardhan, Manoj Tiwari, Pravesh Verma and Ramesh Vidhuri and Meenakshi Lekhi were also present
 hansraj hans or gautam gambhir sadan se nadaarad rahe
 Hardeep Puri reminded that while launching the dream discussion of PM Modi, Puri said that the passage of this bill will benefit about 50 lakh citizens of the national capital
 unhone kaha ki is kanoon ke banane ke baad dilli kii anadhikrut coloniyon ke nivaasiyon ko apni sampatti kaa mukhtarnama, vikray qaraar, vasiyat, kabja patr aadi ke aadhaar par sampatti kaa panjikaran kara sakenge tathaa evam anya dastavejon or saakshyon ko hasil kar sakenge jinke aadhaar par ve unki sampattiyon par kanoonee kabja sabit kar saken
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream is that every Indian should have his own house and keeping this in mind, the construction work was started in various states on the initiative of the Central Government, but some states are far behind
 congress saansad ne uthaae sawalis vidheyak par charchaa ke liye congress saansad anumala aar reddy ne poocha ki in coloniyon main garib log rah rahe hai to unase shulk lene kii baat kyon kahi ja rahi he or aise sabhi logon kii sampattiyon kaa nishulk panjikaran kiya janaa chahie tathaa inamen skool, aspataal, nikasi, peyajal, samudaay haal jaisi suvidhaayen honi chahie or kendra sarkaar ko iske liye vikaas raashi rakhni he
 He put a question mark as to why the central government remembered to regularize these colonies even before the Delhi elections
 kendra sarkaar ne bihar chunaav se pehle bihar ke liye ek vishesh package kii ghoshnaa kii thi lekin chunaav baad sab kuch bhula diya gaya
 Similarly, it was said to give special state status to Andhra Pradesh but nothing was remembered
 unhone kaha ki jin 66 coloniyon kon is vidheyak ke daayre se baahar kiya gaya he unhen bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 During the discussion in the Lok Sabha in the Lok Sabha on the statement of BJP MP Ramesh Vidhuri, Ramesh Vidhuri said that earlier DDA used to act like land mafia to take land from farmers
 pichley 40 saalon se log un anadhikrut coloniyon main rah rahe hai
 They do not even have the right to own their own house
 dilli main keval vot bank kii raajnneeti kii gai
 The suffering of those poor was not heard
 is dauraan vipaksh ke log lagaataar hangaamaa karte rahe
 He was also repeatedly restrained from the posture that you cannot name anyone
 loksabhaa main bole manoj tiwari- ek hi dil he modi ji kitni baar lootogeloksabhaa main bijepi saansad manoj tiwari ne avaidh colony main rahane vaale logon kaa mudda uthaate hue rajya mantri hardip puri kii tarif bhi kii or kaha ki unhone bahut acha kaam kiya
 Manoj Tiwari said that people are saying how many times Modi ji will have one heart
 beniwal or bhagwant maan ke bich hui tokaa-tokirajasthan ke nagaur se ralospa saansad hanuman beniwal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri or mantri hardip puri ko dhanyavad duungaa jinhone antim chor par baithe garibon kii chintaa dur kii
 Meanwhile, Bhagwant Mann made some remarks on which Beniwal said that Maan Saab, you have come prepared
 jiske baad asana par maujuud minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki beniwal ji aap chair se baat kiijie duusari taraf dhyaan dene kii jarurat nahin he
 After which Beniwal further said that by 2024, the people of the country have given the opportunity of service
 aap chaahe jitna boycott karo usase koi fark nahin padane vaala
 Today, if this bill comes in Delhi, then the unregulated colonies of all the metros will also get hope
 bijepi saansad ne ginaae modi sarkaar ke kampashchimi dilli se bijepi saansad pravesh sahib singh verma ne kaha ki jo samasya badi-badi sarkaar nahin khatm kar pai wo mere pradhanmantri ne sulajhaaye
 370 ended there was no riot
 ram mandir ban rahaa he mere pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal main ban rahaa he kisi ko pareshaani nahin hui
 35A ended, nothing happened
 tripal talaak khatm hua
 Today, this unauthorized colony of 200-200 years old, i understand that if any MP sitting here opposes it, he should be ashamed
 is par bhagwant maan ne tippanee kii
 Pravesh Verma further said that i am happy that this is the last election in Delhi in which the issue of unauthorized colony will not remain
 hamane to is kaarykaal main aise kaam kar die ki tum ek-ek kaam par kai sarkaar bana sakate the
 Speaking on a fee of 2900 rupees, he said that our government is making the poor people self-respecting
 kuch logon kaa swabhimaan nahin hota
 Bhagwant Mann praised Kejriwal, AAP MP from Sangrur in Punjab said that today our government has done that the son of a judge, son of a DC and son of a rickshawler are all studying on a bench
 arvind kejariwal ne wo kaam kar diya jo inako pataa hi nahin he
 He has a lot of sorrow because Delhi will not come
 dilli ab inaki nahin he, ye meri-meri kar rahe hai
 There are three mlas in the capital
 emsidi kiski he, didie kiskaa he
 You break the Ravidas temple
 dosha kiskaa he
 Continuing his talk, Mann further said that there are three mlas in the capital
 congress kaa to koi nahin he
 After which the Lok Sabha Speaker, while interrupting Bhagwant Mann said that you only speak on the bill
 jiske baad maan ne kaha ki puraa desh inhone dilli ko samaj liya he
 The three governments in Delhi are MCD, DDA and Arvind Kejriwal
 iske baad unhen ek baar phir tokaa gaya ki ve bill par bolen
 Bhagwant Mann said ending his talk with Rahat Indauri
 
 
 sarhad par tanaav he kya? pataa karo chunaav he kya?minakshi lekhi boleen- praja ke sukh main sarkaar kaa sukh haini dilli se bijepi saansad minakshi lekhi ne dilli kii anadhikrut coloniyon par baat karte hue kaha ki praja ke sukh main sarkaar kaa sukh he
 The interest of the government is in the interest of the subjects
 praja ko jo priy he vahi sarkaar ko priy he
 And this bill which is loved by the public is doing the same work
