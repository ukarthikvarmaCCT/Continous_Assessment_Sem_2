 Somnath has its own place in Hinduism
 somnath mandir ko 12 jyotirlingon main pehla sthaan praapt he
 Not only this, it is said that Mahadev does not allow any devotees to return empty at this rate
 gujarat ke saurashtra se hokar prabhas kshetra main kadam rakhte hi dur se hi dikhaai dene lagata he wo dhvaj jo hajaaron varshon se bhagwaan somnath kaa yashgan karata aa rahaa he, jise dekhakar shiv kii shakti kaa, unki khyaati kaa ehsaas hota he
 The shrine of the temple touching the sky speaks of the glory of Devadhidev, where Mahadev in his grand form cares for the devotees
 ek puranic manyata ke anusaar somnath mandir main sthapit jyotirling hi dwadash jyotirlingon main sthapit sabase pehla rudra jyotirling he, jahaan aakar apana man bhagwaan ko arpan karne waalon kii har muraad puri hoti he
 Devotees start flocking to darshan of Lord Somnath from dawn to empty empty hopes
 yahaan aane vaale har shraddhalu ke man main gaye atoot vishwaas hota he ki ab unki sari mushibaton kaa ant ho jayega
 If someone comes to atone for their sins, someone worships Lord Shiva as Somnath after taking a long vow of his sweetheart, then someone brings his ninja to the court of God with the hope that God will give him long and May you be blessed with healthy life
 desh duniya kii seemaa se pare har roj hajaaron shraddalu yahaan pahunchate hai
 In the temple, first of all the devotees are met by Nandi, the beloved vehicle of God, who looks as if Nandi is leading every devotee of God
 mandir ke andar pahunch kar ek alag hi duniya main hone kaa ehsaas hota he, jis taraf bhi najar padati he bhagwaan ke chamatkaar kaa koi na koi rup najar aata he
 No devotee wants to miss the opportunity to witness the amazing makeup of God
 mastak par chandramaa ko dhaaran kiye devon ke dev mahadev kaa sabase panchamrita snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 After bathing, Bari comes to her gorgeous and supernatural makeup
 shivlinga par chadann se uun ankit kiya jaataa he or phir belptr arpit kiya jaataa he
 Devotees immersed in Shiva devotion keep seeing this supernatural form of their adoration
 unhen is baat kaa ehsaas hone lagata he ki yah jivan dhanya ho gaya
 After worshiping Lord Somnath, the temple priests worship every form of God, which is a privilege to see in itself
 ant main us mahaasaagar kii aarti utaari jaati he jo subah sabase pehle uthakar apni laharon se bhagwaan ke charnon kaa abhishek karata he, lekin jate jate bhakt bhagwaan ke vaahan nandi ji se apni mannaten bhagwaan tak pahunchane kii sifarish karnaa nahin bhoolatey, kyonki bhakton kaa maananaa he ki unke aradhy tak unki har guhaar nandi ji hi pahunchaate hai
 The design of Somnath temple and the craftsmanship done on the walls of the temple is a classic example of Shiva devotion
 somnath mandir kaa itihaas bataata he ki samay-samay par mandir par kai akraman hue tod-phod kii gayi
 There were a total of 17 attacks on the temple and each time the temple was renovated, but there is no effect of any period on the temple
 kehete hai sristi kii rachana ke samay bhi yah shivlinga maujuud tha rugveda main bhi iske mahatv kaa bakhaan kiya gaya he
 According to religious texts, Moon had worshiped Shiva here to get freedom from curse, hence the name of this temple was named Somnath only after the name of Moon
 shiv puraana ke anusaar prachin kaal main raja daksh kii 27 kanyaayein thi, jinka vivaah raja daksh ne chandramaa se kar diya, lekin chandramaa ne 27 kanyaon main se keval ek rohinee ko hi patni kaa darja diya
 Daksha tried to convince the son-in-law a lot, but when he did not listen to Daksha, he cursed the Moon for being a tuberculosis and Chandradev's radiance began to fade
 pareshaan hokar chandramaa brahmadev ke paas pahunche
 Hearing the problem of the moon, Soma, Brahma told him that only Mahadev could get rid of leprosy, but for this he would have to worship Lord Shiva by bathing in Agarb Sagar located at the mouth of Saraswati
 nirog hone ke liye chandramaa ne kathor tapasya kii, jisase khush hokar mahadev ne unhen shraap se mukt kar diya
 Shivdev Chandradev built the golden temple of Shiva here and the Jyotirlinga installed in it was named Lord of the Moon i

 Just on 9 September, the chiefs of the army, navy and air force sent separate letters or 'signs' to their soldiers, stating that the possibility of an increase in their salaries from the recommendations of the Seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC)
 It was being made, it could not be implemented
 vajah bataai gai ki siforeeshon main chand visangatiyaan hai jinka samaadhaan jaruri he
 It was as if the situation was repeated in September 2008, when the chiefs of the three armies avoided implementing the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission due to some discrepancies
 is dfa bhi sena pramukh chaahate the ki vetan ayog kii siforeeshon par amal karne se pehle sarkaar chaar mukhya masalon kaa hal nikaale, jo is prakaar hai: sainya balon ke liye non-functional apgrade yaa junior kamishan officer ko ooncha vetan or civil or military sevaaon ke liye ek samaan pe-matrix
 On 12 September, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar in the Modi government did exactly what his predecessor A
K
 ke
 Antony had tried to do it nearly a decade earlier: to placate him with the promise of finding a solution in the future
 parrikar ne kathith taur par air chif marshall arup rahaa or nausena pramukh admiral sunil lamba ko saatven kendriya vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kii salaah di
 He said that his expectations would be met later
 parrikar ne elaan kiya ki raksha mantralay ke vitt salaahkaar sahit carmik prashikshan vibhaag ke sachiv kii adhyakshata main ek 22 sadasyeey panel vetan ayog kii visangatiyon kaa adhyayan karegaa
 Things are still difficult, just like they were in 2008
 sena pramukh abhi atakalon main uljhe hai, jaisaa unhone pehle bhi kiya tha, jabaki dekhne vaale 'civil-military' sambandhon or unke talmail main ubhartee duusari daraar par afsos kar rahe hai jiske bagaiyr raksha mantralay kaa kaamkaaj durust nahin chal saktaa
 Says a senior army officer, "we want the government to address these four major issues that have been pending since the Sixth Pay Commission

 The dissatisfaction with the recommendations had begun to pick up since Mathur had submitted the report to the government last November and the salary of about 1 crore central government employees (including pensioners) did not increase by a modest 15 per cent due to the restlessness of the army

 The biggest malaise was that special duty allowance has been given to officers of the Indian Administrative Service and paramilitary forces deployed in remote areas
 misaal ke taur par uttar-purv main tainaat ek iees adhikari bhatte ke taur par 60,000 ru
 One can get an amount which is twice the salary of a military officer posted at the most inaccessible place like Siachen Glacier
 iske alaava duusare mudde bhi hai jaise viklaangata bhatta
 Earlier the allowance of soldiers was assessed on percentage basis in case of injuries while performing duty, which has been changed to a single slab arrangement in which all would be given uniform allowance
 sena ke ek adhikari ke anusaar ''zyaadaatar maamalon main apane bathroom main phisal kar girane vaale civil adhikari ko ladaai main hataahat hone vaale sainya karmi se zyada viklaangata pension or surakshit naukari kaa haq mil jayega

 He emphasized on special conditions of service which are not applicable to other officers of All India Services
 unhone report main visangatiyon ke bare main bataaya
 For example, the junior commissioned officer commanding the platoons has been placed in the same pay category in which the soldiers are also under him

 The battle for equality between bureaucracy and defense forces is the root of the dispute between civil service and military service
 sena ko naukarshahi kaa khel saaf najar aa rahaa he jo uske darje ko hi nahin, balki uske vetan or bhatton ke muddon ko bhi haashie par daal rahaa he
 The biggest example is that the three chiefs of the army were gradually pushed down the list of important government officials according to the 'warrant of Presidency', rank and office
 us fehrist main sena ke teenon angon ke pramukhon ko cabinet sachiv or atorni general ke baad 13wein paaydaan par rakh gaya he
 That is why the army chiefs have demanded NFU
 yah ek aisa bhatta he jo aam taur par civil adhikariyon ko diya jaataa he jisase ve padonnati na milane kii sthiti main bhi ooncha vetan hasil kar sakate hai
 The Army says that the structure of the Pay Commission itself is proof that it has been ignored
 sainya balon main 14 lakh se adhik purush or mahilaayein shaamil hai jo sarkari adhikariyon kaa 30 fisadi he
 There has never been a military participation in the Pay Commission
 aisi sthiti 1973 se bani hui he jab tisare vetan ayog ke daayre main sena ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 In 2009, the government agreed to set up a separate Military Pay Commission for the first time
 par baad main saatven kendriya vetan ayog main sainya pratinidhi ko shaamil karne kii baat kahkar taal diya
 Neither of the two fulfilled the promise
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki sena or iees naukarshahi ke bich kii khai bahut gahari he
 It has now turned into a cold war which has been going on between the two sides for the last two months
 sena ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''jo bhi file civil adhikariyon ke paas bheji jaati he, use tippaniyon ke saath waapas kar diya jaataa he, kyonki ve hamase apane offis main milanaa chaahate hai or jab ham vahaan jate hai to hamen ehsaas dilaayaa jaataa he ki bos koun he

 Usually, this purchase starts from November 1
 lekin is baar rajya sarkaar ne 15 navambar se dhan kii kharidi shuru karne kaa nirnay liya he
 Due to this, farmers are agitating across the state
 congress ne kisaanon ke is andolanon ko yah kahkar hawa de di he ki, sarkaar kii praathamikta kisaan nahin balki 1 navambar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa chhattisgarh aagaman he

 raipur se lekar bastar tak to bilaspur se lekar sarguja tak in dinon kisaanon ke jatthe sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji karte saafe taur par dekhe ja sakate hai

 deepawali sir par he, sahuukaar karj kii adayegi ko lekar tagada kar rahaa he
 And after harvesting from above, the paddy has to be stored in the field Khaliano

 According to him, only ten percent of farmers harvest their crops before Deepawali
 fasalon kii kataai ke baad uske sookhne or rakh-rakhaav ke liye puure 15 din lagate hai
 Accordingly, the date of purchase of paddy has been fixed as 15 November
 sarkaar kaa aarope he ki congress is maamle main jaanboojhkar kisaanon ko bargala rahi he
 While he is aware of reality
 chhattisgarh main lagaataar do baar sookhaa padane ke chalate kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke 208 maamle saamne aae hai
 However, this time the monsoon has supported the farmers
 kahi unke khet khalihraan kati hui fasalon se pate pade hai
 So somewhere in the fields green crops are blooming
 kisaan khush to he lekin tyohaari sijan main khaali jeb unhen baari pad rahe hai
 Many farmers also turned to paddy mandis

 Dayanidhi's lawyer argued that he played an important role in popularizing broadband during his tenure

 misskol he kya ?phone par kuch second bajkar aapke phone chune se pehle hi cat jane vaale kol ko misskol kehete hai
 How did misscall originate? There are many differences among researchers and historians about its origins, some call it the brainchild of a miser, while some say it was from the hands of a businessman in a California grove in the late twentieth century
 It originated due to the phone being dropped and cut in half
 bhartiya itihaaskaaron kii maane to sindhughati sabhyataa se judi khudaai ke dauraan lothal main unhen martabaan main band ek kabutar ke asthipanjar ke saath kora tamrapatr mila he, jise pehla misskol mana ja saktaa he
 What are the types of misscalls? Many times the call is missed simply because you are not present near your mobile phone, in this case, the call missed all the time is called 'natural misscall'
 kai baar offis, meeting, car yaa garlfrend kii nigaraanee main hone ke kaaran aap chaahate hue bhi phone nahin uthaa pate ise ‘paristhitijanya misskol’ kehete hai
 But the call often cut before carefully planning and guessing the shortest interval of seconds is called 'intentional misscall'
 misskol karata koun he?misskol koi bhi kar saktaa he,aapaki garlfrend, padosi, rishtedaar, mirzapur vaali buaa kaa betaa, offis kaa sahakarmi, makanamalik koi bhi, kisi par bhi bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is possible that the person you trust the most will betray you and miss you
 koi misskol karata hi kyon he?kai kaaran he, kuch log desh or samaaj ko kaaphi kuch dena chaahate hai par sirf misskol de pate hai, kuch log majaburi main misskol karte hai kyonki unke phone main balance hi itnaa bachataa he ki wo bas misskol kar pate hai
 Some people call the front person by putting a balance in the mobile and consider it a waste of money, while some people miss out due to miserliness
 kai baar misskol logon ke mood ke hisaab se aate hai, agar phone par kii jane vaali baat se aapkaa bhala hone vaala he to aapako misskol kiya jaataa he varna kol
 Some people miss due to hesitation that if you are busy and your important work is not missed due to the phone, you will call when you get the time
 kuch log mitavyayi hote hai par kanjus nahin isliye wo misskol karke pehle aapako satark karte hai jab aap apane saare kaam chhodkar phone tak aate hai wo kol kar dete hai, kuch log hinabhaavna se dabe hote hai, unhen lagata he ki agar wo aapako apane kharche par kol karenge to ye aapkaa apmaan hoga
 And finally, the misscalls that are made right, such calls often come from the wives and girlfriends, when such a call has to be cut and returned before it is missed
 misskol kaa sahitya main kya yogadan rahaa he?misskol kitabon or mobile kii chololog se nikal mujeec gailaree tak pahunch gaya he, bhojpuri gaanon kii amritvarsha ke bich aap ‘misskol maar rahi ho chumban kii abhilaashi ho, kaa ho?’ bhavarth vaale geet sun sakate hai, haalanki bihar police ke nae niyam ke baad ki mahilaon ko misskol karne par jail bhi ho sakati he iske nihitarth badal gaye hai
 Even in Bollywood it has been accepted hand in hand, even the most revered 'brother' Salman Khan himself has hinted at the belt 'girls will patte hum hum misak kol, Pyaar tere chitra hai passevak mein faqvikal
 ’misskol se nijaat kaise paaen?misskol laailaaj he, bachaav hi upachaar he
 If you miss the call then you will miss many important calls, make your heart big and loose your pocket, do yoga everyday in the morning, increase concentration, increase your reaction time by watching jonty rhodes and catches on youtube, pick up the calls before they are missed
 And if you are not able to succeed and any of your work is not getting stuck, instead of making the call, start to miss it yourself

 The views of that article are entirely those of its author and the Sangh has nothing to do with it
 ' He said that the Sangh as a movement has always condemned the idea and action of violence
 isliye vah haal ke loksabhaa chunaav main kerala main chaalaakudi seat se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar rahe bi

 ) Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa today claimed that after 'black magic' was unsuccessful in trying to oust him from power, it is now being used to kill him

 Yeddyurappa, who has been facing difficulties since assuming the Chief Minister's throne in 2008, said, "there is a conspiracy to kill me
" main is baat ko lekar aashwast nahin hum ki main vidhaan saudh (rajya sachivalay) se surakshit ghar laut sakuunga
 Yeddyurappa, who brought the BJP to the corridors of power for the first time in South India, has won two battles on the inner front and has won the confidence vote twice in the assembly
 iske alaava kathith bhrashtachar ke ek aapraadhik maamle main rajyapal ech aar bharadwaj ne haal hi main unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kii anumati di he
 On October 11, when Yeddyurappa first faced a strength test in the assembly, a chopped head and vermilion puja material was found near Vidhana Soudha, which bolstered the rumor that it was part of black magic
 yediurppa ne iske liye vipaksh par aarope lagaaya, lekin vipaksh kaa kahana he ki satta main bane rahane ke liye yah khud aise kaamon main shaamil rahe hai
 When a reporter asked Yeddyurappa if he considered the alleged black magic as a threat to his life, Yeddyurappa said, "what else?" Yeddyurappa, who visits the temple in general and especially in times of crisis, donates with an open heart and his steps are widely criticized by the opposition
 yediurppa kaa kahana he ki vah is tarah ke khataron (kaala jaadu) se ghabaraane vaale nahin hai
 He said that he would write to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding Bhardwaj's remark about 'ulta Chor Kotwal Dante'
 unhone ise apana or rajya kii chah karod aabaadi kaa apmaan bataaya
 Bhardwaj, who has often been involved in controversies with Yeddyurappa, made this comment recently when the state cabinet advised him not to decide on an application to prosecute the chief minister
 unhone kaha, ‘bhaajapa kaa aalaa kaman puri tarah mere saath he
 i want to tell the people outside the BJP and the people of my party that for the next two years, there will be a BJP government in the state and no one can remove it

 All i can say is that the party high command is fully with me

 Facebook location tracking is a big issue
 khaas kar unalogon ke liye jinhen privesi pasand he
 However, after turning off the location, it seems that Facebook will not track you
 lekin shaayad yah galat he
 Because the company keeps tracking the user location for advertising

 It has also been found in some recent leaks and data breeches
 uniwarsity of south california ke computer science ke assistant professor ailexandra coroloo ne medium par is bare main jaankaree di he
 Here is also how Facebook gives basic targeted advertisements at their location, while they have neither added their location details to the profile nor turned on the location
 itnaa hi nahin unhone har tarah ke tareeke yuj kiye jisase lokation share na ho
 Korolova says that she had turned off Location History in the Facebook app and disabled the location access to Facebook in the ios settings as well
 iske alaava unhone ne apane shahar or kisi bhi tarah ke lokation tagd photo or contant fasebuk profile par nahin aplod kiya
 But even then they were constantly advertised based on the location of their home and office
 corolova ke mutabik fasebuk par diya gaya lokation control ek bhram he or ye asal main ye control he hi nahin
 Facebook has told Gizmodo, 'we use IP addresses and other information that contain current cities of check ins and profiles

 The Delhi government maintained its stand, however, during the hearing, the Delhi government stated its stand and said that they are short of funds
 isiilie vah dilli ke logon ko hi ilaaj main variyata dena chaahate hai
 The government believed that because of their circulars, it would be easier to reduce the large crowd in Delhi hospitals
 apane paksh main dilli sarkaar ne kaha kibengalsarkaar bhi aisa kar rahi he
 On this plea, the petitioner said that the Kissuprim Court had already imposed a fine on the Bengal government for doing so and currently such a rule is not in Bengal
 circular kaa nuksaan marijon koyachika daayar karne vaale vakingshok agarwalka kahana tha ki yah circular raajnneeti se prerit he
 Its direct harm is suffering to the patients
 desh main koi bhi sarkaar, kisi bhi sarkari aspataal main ilaaj ke liye marij ko manaa nahin kar sakati he
 It is against the constitution
 hoicourt ne is maamle main sabhi pakshon ko sunne ke baad faisla surakshit kar liya he
 The decision coming from Delhi High Court will decide whether this circular of the state government will be valid now or else the High Court will cancel it

 Muktada Hasan Nida Fazli
 ne 78 saal kii umr main somvaar ko aakhri saans lee
 Jagjit Singh was born on 8 February 1941
 unhone nida fazli se pehle duniya chhod di, lekin puri duniya main faile nida sahab ke diwaanon main se adhiktar ne unhenjagajitke jariye hi suna
 Jagjit Singh gave voice to most of the Ghazals of Nida Fazli
 yaa kahie ki nida fazli ne jagajeet singh kii gayaki ko nayab najmen di
 The example of both pair is' insight'in both word and tone pair effect has always been seen to increase

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has played 43 matches and scored more than 700 runs in more than seven years, but he still awaits the first half-century in Twenty20 international cricket
 dhoni ne cricket ke sabase chote praaroop main ab tak 772 ran banaae hai, lekin unka ucchtam score naabad 48 ran he
 He tops the list of batsmen scoring the most runs without scoring a half-century
 dhoni bangladesh main hone vaali isisi vishwa tii-20 championships main bada score khadaa karne kii koshish karenge
 One of the best finishers in the world, Dhoni's main reason for not reaching the fifties so far is his lower order
 vah apane kariyar main paanchaven or chathe number par 13-13 baar ballebaaji ke liye utre jabaki bahut kam over yaa phir lakshya hasil karne ke liye kam ran bache the
 This is the reason why he has been unbeaten 16 times so far in his career
 unke paas ardhshtak tak pahunchane kaa sabase badhiya mauka australia ke khilaaf 2012 main sidney main khele gaye match main tha
 India were then 10 runs away from the target and Dhoni needed five runs for the half-century
 iske baad vah apane khate main teen ran hi or jod paae
 Dhoni, however, left behind his previous highest score
 unhone srilanka ke khilaaf 2009 main mohali main 46 ran banaae the
 Even then he was in a position to complete Pachasa, but Dilhara Fernando's inswing yarker did not let him reach this point

 Sammy's highest score is only 30 runs
 dhoni ne vaise tii-20 ke sabhi prakaar kii cricket main 15 ardhshtak lagaae hai or unka ucchtam score naabad 73 ran he
 The record of scoring the most runs in T20 cricket without scoring a half-century is also named after an Indian Ravindra Jadeja
 jadeja ne ab tak 108 tii-20 maichon main 1278 ran banaae hai or unka ucchtam score 48 ran he
 He is followed by Pakistan's Yasir Arafat (1027 runs)

 jiesti main graahak raja hoga! tex chori band! jidipi main oochaal! rajyon kii zyada kamai! tex afasaron kaa aatank khatm! chote kaarobaariyon ke liye badi suvidhaayen! jiesti se apekshaaon kii udaan main agar koi kami rah gai thi to pradhanmantri ke 8 agast ke loksabhaa ke sambodhan ne use puraa kar diya he
 Actually, there is a big similarity between 2014's Narendra Modi and 2016 GST
 donon hi apekshaaon ke jowar par savaar hokar aae hai
 In 2014, there is no idea of the juggernauts, however, the Prime Minister certainly has a chance to make GST a reform that aims at rejuvenating a large sector of the economy and giving far-reaching benefits
 sanyog se jiesti ko kaamyaab banane ke liye pradhanmantri ke paas paryaapt rajnatik takat he, saath hi sansad ke donon sadanon ne abhootpurv sarvanumati ke saath jiesti kaa jo khaakaa manjuur kiya he, uske praavdhaan jiesti ko krantikari sudhaar bana sakate hai basharte centre sarkaar sooyeeboojh or sanyam ke saath jiesti kaa rajnatik netritv kar sake
 Crossing the threshold of Parliament, the GST has got three such rules which never before had such a big reform in India (center and collective of all states)
 1
 The GST Bill approved by Parliament contains all the suggestions of the Empowered Committee of States and the consent of the Center
 jiesti ke purvaj yani waite (vailu aded tex) ko 2005 main sahmati kaa yah tohfa nahin mila tha
 Seven states including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh together with the entire country did not implement VAT
 ye rajya is sudhaar main baad main shaamil hue
 2
 jiesti council ke taur par desh ko pehali baar ek behatar taqatvar sangheey samiti mil rahi he, jisamen rajyon ke samuhik adhikaar centre se zyada hai
 This is the first of its kind in terms of economic decisions which should become the foundation of good GST
 3
 The potential financial losses of the state governments are insured
 yadi jiesti lagu karne se tex ghatata he to centre sarkaar paanch saal tak isaki bharpai karegi
 After this constitutional guarantee for the first time, the option of making GST less burdensome for consumers has been opened
 vyapak sahmati, faisle lene kii paardarshee pranali or rajyon ke nuksaan kii bharpai kii guarantee ke baad, yakeenan jiesti ek dhanchaagat sudhaar ho saktaa he lekin iske liye centre sarkaar ko jiesti ke gathan main chah vyavasthaaen anivaary rup se sunishchit kerani hongi
 This work can only be done by the central government as GST will be led by the team of Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitley
 pehlahmodi yadi jiesti main graahakon ko raja bananaa chaahate hai to unhen jiesti kii standard dar 18 fisadi rakhane ke liye rajnatik sahmati banani hogi
 State VAT Standard Rate 14
 5 fisadi he, jiske tahat 60 fisadi utpaada aate hai jabaki central exise kii 12
 The 36 standard rate applies to most products
 sarvice tex kii dar 15 fisadi he
 If combined with these three, the standard GST rate of 18 percent can be fixed, then it will be the biggest success of GST
 is dar ke tahat kuch utpaadon or sevaaon par tex badhegaa lekin kai duusare taxon ko milaane ke phaayde ise santulit karenge or mahangaai kaabo main rahegi
 The central government can persuade the states to balance this, as the Constitution Amendment Bill has ensured their losses
 doosaraahurja va jameen aarthik utpaadan kii sabase badi laagat he lekin bijli, petro utpaada or stamp duty jiesti se baahar hai
 It is impossible to reduce the cost of business without reducing taxes on them
 inhen jiesti ke daayre main laana hoga
 The central government can agree to do this to the GST Council under a three-year action plan
 tisaraakendre ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki jiesti kaarobaar ke liye kar paalan kii laagat (cost of compliance) na badaye
 The draft bill of GST is frightening
 isamen ek karadaata ke kai (centre va rajya) assesament, darjanon panjikaran, ritern or sajaa jaise praavdhaan hai
 If they are not abolished, then GST can become a sample of tax terrorism
 chauthangiasti kii raah par aage badhate hue centre sarkaar ko rajyon main gaiyr-kar rajasav jutaney ke nae tareekon or kharch kam karne ke upayon kii jugat lagaani hogi
 The Finance Commission and NITI Aayog can take the lead in this matter
 jiesti kanoon ke tahat rajyon main kar niyamon main aae din badlaav kii sambhaavnaaen simit kerani hongi
 Fifth: Local bodies need resources for cleanliness, infrastructure and other needs
 jiesti main kai aise tex shaamil ho rahe hai jo in nikaayon kii aay kaa strot hai
 The Center has to keep in mind that just as the states' share in the revenue of the Center is fixed, the share of local bodies in the revenue of the states is determined
 chatha:jiesti kii vyavastha tay karte hue centre kii aguai main jiesti council ko har str par sabhi pakshon yani upabhokta, chote-bade udhyami, sthaneey nikaayon ko charchaa main jodpha hoga jo abhi tak nahin kiya gaya he
 Many people will say that it is better to have a weak GST than not GST, but the reality is that the absence of GST is better in light of a poor GST that will cause problems
 jiesti bharat main sudhaaron kii duusari peedi kii sabase badi pahal he or abhi isaki sirf neenv rakhi gai he
 If the Prime Minister believes that GST will change the face of India, then he himself should lead this reform
 yadi ve desh ko ek doorgaami, sahaj or kam mahangaai vaala tex system de sake to yah aarthik udaarikaran ke baad bharat kii sabase badi uplabdhi hogi, jise lekar itihaas unhen hameshaa yaad rakhega

 In Kaushambi district of Uttar Pradesh, a son beat his father to death with a stick
 aaropee bete ne apane sharaabi pita kii harkaton se pareshaan ho kar yah khaufnak kadam uthaaya
 This sensational incident of murder is in the Charva police station area of kaushambi district
 jahaan chapahuaan gaanv main rahane vaala 50 varshiya chandrabhan paasi roj sharaab pikar apni patni or bacchon ke saath marpet or galigalouj karata tha
 The family and neighbors were also disturbed by this action
 beeti raat bhi vah nashe main dhut hokar aayaa or patni kusum ko gaali dene laga
 The elder betebrijesh forbade him to do so but he did not agree and started killing Kusum
 tabhi uske bete ne maa ke saath milakar chandrabhan kii danda se jamkar dhunaai kar di
 According to the police, Pasi died on the spot due to beating
 is vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad maa or betaa donon maukey se faraar ho gaye
 In the morning when neighbors saw inside the house, Pasi's body was lying
 padosiyon ne fouran is baat kii khabar police ko di
 After receiving the information, the police reached the spot and sent Chandrabhan in Kashwakabje for postmortem
 ghatana ke baad mritak ke bhai or anya rishtedaar maukey par pahunch gaye
 Station in-charge Ram Asare Saroj said that a case has been registered against the mother-son of the deceased's brother's tahrir and possible targets are being pressed for their survival
 nargis dutt or nutan jaisi abhinetriyon ke clasik daur ke kai saalon baad bollywood main aajkal nayika pradhan filmon ke banane kaa silsilaa tej hua he
 Now in commercial Hindi films, the heroine has started capturing the prime content audience
 aalia bhatta kii raji iskaa taaja udhaaharan he
 The beginning of such films in Bollywood can be clearly attributed to Vidya Balan's 'parineeta' and 'kahaani'
 2010 ke baad pichley aath saalon main hindi filmon main mahilaon kaa charitra behad majboot hota najar aa rahaa he
 This new phase of Bollywood which started with Vidya, has reached Alia Bhatt's consent
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bataur 'femail superstar' kai maamalon main aalia samakaleen abhinetriyon se aage nikalati dikh rahi hai
 Under the direction of Meghna Gulzar, Raji is being liked by the audience
 film ne 6 din main 51 karod se zyada kii kamai kar lee he
 Aaliyah is being given credit for success
 aisa swaabhaavik he kyonki aalia, raji kaa mukhya kirdaar to hai hi film kaa ekmaatr bada cheharaa bhi
 By the way, in terms of box office, 2018 will be considered in many ways for female stars in Bollywood
 is saal ab tak femail lead ke taur par chaar filmein dekhne ko milin
 Before Raji, Deepika Padukone's Padmavat, Anushka Sharma's Pari, Vidya Balan's Tumhari Sulu and Rani Mukerji's Hiccup were released
 laagat ke mukaable in filmon kaa box offis collection kaaphi acha rahaa
 If Deepika's 'padmavat' is omitted in this list, Alia's persuasive year has become the biggest hit film as a female lead
 raji ne pehle hafte main 51
 24 crores
 is hafte hindi main koi badi film nahin he, ummid he ki hollywood kii 'ded pool' ke saath aalia kii raji duusare hafte bhi acha kaarobaar kar le
 It is also expected that Alia breaks the box office records of Vidya Balan's Kahaani (57 Crore), Dirty Picture (82 Crore) and Priyanka Chopra's Meri Com (56 Crore)
 aalia kii raji ke saamne sirf padmavat hi aisi film he jiskaa record todna asambhav sa lagata he
 However, due to the presence of Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor in the film, it is not considered a section of the critics to be just Deepika's film
 aisi kai or filmein bhi hai jo 2000 se pehle bani hai
 On the other hand, Alia's roles in films like Highway, Udta Punjab have led some to consider her the biggest female superstar with Deepika in the current era
 ek varisht cinema patrkaar ne naam na chhapane kii shart par is tarah kii tulana ko aadharahin bataaya
 In his opinion, even though Alia's film broke the record of earning the last few films of Sridevi, Vidya and Rani at the box office, Alia's performance in Raj, ahead of the female lead of Mom, Kahaani, Dirty Picture, Tumha Sulu Does not stay clasik daur kii abhinetriyon se to tulana karnaa bemaani hoga
 He believes that being the film under the banner of Karan Johar, Raji got the benefit of good publicity strategy and marketing which is being added to Alia's account
 vatan ke aage kuch bhi nahin- aalia kii film raji kaa pehla gaanaa jaridusre film sameekshak ajay brahmatmaj kehete hai- ye karan johar, vinit jain or nirdeshak meghna gulzaar kii bhi film he
 Vicky Kaushal and the performances of other actors who perform small but excellent roles in the film cannot be ignored
 raji kii safalataa kaa credit sirf aalia ko dena galat hoga
 It would also be wrong to call it Alia's film
 ajay sawaal karte hai- agar raji main vicky kaushal kii jagah shahid kapur jaise sitare hote to kya ise aalia kii film kehete?2011 se ab tak bollywood kii chuninda nayika pradhanfilmenpadmavat (2018) :deepika padukon ranvir singh, shahid kapur

 The breaking of this taboo is much bigger than the celebration of Sonam Kapoor's wedding and these female superstars are unmatched, many female superstars and their movies were seen in Bollywood even before 2000
 gujarey jamaane kii femail superstars main devika rani, nargis dutt, madhubala, nutan, vaijayanti maala, wahidaa rahamaan, hema malini, rekha, shridevi, jaya pradaa, maadhuri dikshit jaisi abhinetriyon ko gina ja saktaa he
 These actresses have very successful films as female lead
 inamen devika rani kii achhut kanya, nargis kii madar india, nutan kii bandini, rekha kii khun bhari maang jaisi darjanon filmein he
 These were box office block buster films

 Prepare by preparing a plan supreme court ne privet sector ke sabhi karmchaariyon ke pension main baari badhat kaa rasta saaf kar diya he
 This will increase the pension of private sector employees manifold
 court ne is maamle main ipiefo kii yachika ko khaarij karte hue kerala hai court faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 The Kerala High Court was ordered to give pension to the employees according to their full salary
 philhal ipiefo dwaara 15,000 rupee ke basic vetan kii seemaa ke aadhaar par pension kii gananaa kii jaati he
 Significantly, 12 percent of the basic salary of the employees goes to PF and the employer deposits 12 percent in his name
 company kii 12 fisadi hissedari main 8
 33 per cent share goes to pension fund and the remaining 3
 66 pief main
 According to the Times of India, the Supreme Court has now cleared the way that pension of private employees should be calculated on the basis of full salary
 isse karmchaariyon kii pension kai guna bad jaaegi
 EPF pension or EPS is a pension scheme, under which 8 of the basic salary during the employment of employees working in the organized sector of the private sector
 33 fisadi (1250 rupye masik se zyada nahin) ke baraabar paisa is skim main jamaa hota he
 In lieu of this, it provides a fixed monthly pension to the employee after retirement
 kitni hogi pension main badhatsupreme court ke aadesh ke baad nijee kshetra ke karmchaariyon ke pension main kitni badhotaree hogi
 You can understand this from this chart
 kaary ke varyantim vetanpahale ke niyam se pension (prati maheenaa rupee main)court ke aadesh ke baad pension3350,0005,18025,0002550,0003,42519,2252050,0002,10014,285331,00,0005,18050,000251,00,0003,42538,571201,00,0002,10028,571bharat sarkaar kaa karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan (EPFO) hi sabhi karmchaariyon ke ipief or pension khate ko manage karata he
 Every institution where 20 or more employees work has to participate in EPF
 ipies is yojana ke saath judakar chalati he isliye ipief skim kaa member banane vaala har shaks pension skim kaa member apane aap ban jaataa he
 In EPF or EPS, it is compulsory to deposit the contribution of employees whose basic salary is + DA 15000 or more
 jo karmchaaree isse adhik basic selary pate hai, unke paas ipief or EPS ko apnaane yaa chhodane kaa vikalp hota he
 a part of the money that the employer puts into your PF account is used only for the pension scheme, while the entire amount deducted from your salary goes to the entire EPF scheme
 to agar puri selary ke hisaab se pension bani to karmchaariyon kaa pension kai guna bad jaaegi
 The only disadvantage is that the pension will increase, but the pension fund's fund will decrease, because the additional contribution will go to the EPF instead of going to the EPF
 centre sarkaar ne ipies kii shuruyaat 1995 main kii thi
 Under this, 8 of the basic salary of the employer employee up to 6,500
 33 fisadi hissaa (adhiktam 541 rupee prati maheenaa) pension skim main daalane kaa niyam tha
 But on September 1, 2014, the EPFO changed it to 8 of the basic salary of up to 15,000
 33 fisadi (adhiktam 1,250 rupee prati maheenaa) kar diya
 Pension and PF are provided under GPF for government employees

 Whatever happened at that time was very tragic and for that Dr
 manmohan singh ne pradhanmantri rahete hue sansad main maafee bhi maangi
 Rahul Gandhi cannot be held responsible for that violence
 us samay vah koi 13 yaa 14 varsh ke rahe honge
 He cannot be convicted

 Around 3,000 Sikhs were killed in the 1984 riots following the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguard

 Rahul Gandhi, who is on a two-day visit to Britain, said in a meeting of UK mps and local leaders on Friday that the incident was a tragedy and a very sad experience, but disagreed that the Congress was 'involved' in it
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki kisi ke bhi khilaaf koi bhi hinsa galat he
 There is a legal process going on in India, but as far as i believe that anything wrong has been done at that time, it should be punished and i support it 100 percent
 'unhone kaha, 'mere man main uske bare main koi bhram nahin he
 It was a tragedy, it was a sad experience
 aap kehete hai ki usamen congress party shaamil thi, main isse sahmati nahin rakhata
 Certainly there was violence, certainly it was tragedy
 'baad main pratishthit landan skool of economics main ek satr ke dauraan jab unase sikh virdohi dangon ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'jab (purv PM) manmohan singh ne iske bare main kaha to vah ham sabhi ke liye bole
 Like i said earlier i am a victim of violence and i understand how it feels
 ' darasal, rahul 1991 memlittedwara apane pita or purv pradhanmantrirajiv gandhiki hatya kaa zikr kar rahe the
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'I am against any kind of violence against anyone on this earth
 main pareshaan ho jaataa hum jab main kisi ko aahat hote dekhtaa hum
 Therefore, i condemn it 100 percent and i am 100 percent in support of punishing people involved in any kind of violence against anyone
 'unhone kaha ki jin logon ne hinsa nahin jheli he, unhen lagata he ki hinsa vahi he jo filmon main dekhte hai
 The Congress leader said, 'it is not so
 maine un logon ko marate dekha he jinhen main bahut pyaar karata tha
 i also saw the person (prabhakaran) dying who killed my father
 ' rahul ne kaha, 'jab maine jafana (srilanka) ke tat par prabhakaran ko mrit dekha to mujhe uske liye dukh hua kyonki maine uski jagah apane pita ko dekha or apni jagah uske bacchon ko dekha
 So when you are suffering from violence, you understand it, it completely affects you

 The central government, along with the Aam Aadmi Party (TMC) and Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, along with the Aam Aadmi, opened the door for a steep hike in diesel prices, cuts in LPG availability and 51% foreign investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail business the very next day
 There were many challenges in front
 trinmul pramukh mamata banerjee kaa jab sabar kaa baandh tutaa to shanivaar ko vah sadakon par utar padin
 Mamata's Trinamool Congress has been consistently opposing it, considering 51 per cent foreign investment in the multi-brand retail business as 'detrimental to the country's farmers'

 When these decisions of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government hurt the Trinamool Congress, the second most constituent of the UPA, the party on Friday asked the Congress to reconsider its decisions by giving a 72-hour ultimatum

 " raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki trinmul congress sambhavat: samprag sarkaar se alag hone ke bare main nahin bhi soch sakati he, kyonki centre ke paas kai vikalp hai
 Samir Kumar Das, a professor of political science at the University of Calcutta, said, "trinamool is not in a position to break away from the central government and achieve anything
 isliye mamata faisle par phir se vichaar karne ke liye centre par dabaav daalane kaa prayaas sakati hai yaa congress ko bich kaa rasta apnaane ke liye baadhya sakati hai
 That is, you can ask to limit the scope of FDI in retail business
 " Das said the Trinamool would not think of joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as it feared losing votes of the minorities
 isi tarah teesraa morcha koi nai shuruyaat nahin karegaa, yah pehle hi sabit ho chukaa he

 Last week, despite the warnings of the Mayor and all other leaders of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, the Delhi Government had released more than Rs 100 crore fund to the Municipal Corporation
 iske baad aisa laga tha ki ab dilli sarkaar or dilli nagar nigam ke bich takaraav khatm ho jayega
 But now the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has made up its mind to surround the Kejriwal government
 shuukravaar dopaher dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke nivas ke baahar dakshini dilli nagar nigam kii meyar sunita kangra, netaa sadan kamaljit saharaavat or sthai samiti ke chairman bhupendra gupta dharne par baithenge
 These leaders will protest against the Kejriwal government for not giving the funds of Delhi Municipal Corporation's share so far
 darasal pichley hi hafte dakshini dilli nagar nigam ke tamaam netaaon ne press conference kar kejariwal sarkaar ko yah chetavanee di thi ki agar 1 hafte main nagar nigam ke hisse kaa fund dilli sarkaar ne jari nahin kiya gaya to nagar nigam ke tamaam netaa mukhyamantri awaas ke baahar na keval dharne par baithenge balki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa gheraav bhi karenge
 Three days later, the Delhi government released a fund of about one hundred and fifty crore rupees to the three corporations
 us vakt aisa laga tha ki shaayad dilli nagar nigam or kejariwal sarkaar ke bich lambey samay se takaraav khatm ho jayega
 But now this is contradicted by the plan of the corporation leaders to picket
 aapako bataa den ki lambey samay se dilli nagar nigam or dilli sarkaar ke bich fund ko lekar takaraav jari he
 On one hand, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi claims that the Kejriwal government is not releasing their share of funds, on the other hand, the Kejriwal government always claims that the corporation has been released more than its share

 Dev Anand, the evergreen actor of Hindi films, was perhaps the first Bollywood actor to try his luck in politics in a formal manner
 raajnneeti main unka thodaa vakt haalanki acha nahin gujara lekin unhone filmi hastiyon ke liye raajnneeti main utarane kaa rasta khol diya

 varsh 1977 main pradhanmantri indira gandhi dwaara desh main apatkaal lagu karne ke baad dev anand ne raajnneeti main utarane or 'raajnneetigyon ko sabak sikhaane' kaa faisla kiya
 Dev Anand formed the National Party of India (NPI) and started his political innings through it
 enpiai ke ek padaadhikari or dev anand ke parivaar ke ek kareebi mitra ne bataaya ki dev anand apatkaal se nafrat karte the
 Because of this he opposed Indira Gandhi, her son Sanjay Gandhi and the top Congress leaders of the time
 apatkaal ke baad dev anand kaa naaraa 'unako sabak sikhaanaa he' bahut hi prachlit hua tha
 Despite this, it is a fact that Dev Anand had good relations with top leaders including the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and even Atal Bihari Bajpayee
 raajnneeti ke prati dev anand kaa yah lagaav hi tha ki unhone apni aatmakatha 'romancing vid life' main apni alpakaaleen raajnneetik pari ke ek mahatvapurn bhaag ko jagah di he
 In the autobiography, Dev Anand compared Sanjay Gandhi to a 'spoiled young prince', recalling the slogan 'indira Bharat Hai, Bharat Indira Hai'
 dev anand ne apni aatmakatha main likhaa he, "
 
 main jaanata hum ki main sanjay mandali ke liye bura aadmi ban gaya hum
 "regarding the Emergency of 1975-77, Dev Anand wrote," The pro-emergency people imposed strict discipline on government offices and the general public through select laws
 isse logon kii aatma karaah rahi thi or use lohe ke haath se dabaa diya gaya tha

 # starparivaarawards2017 # redcarpet with Bae @vikrant8235 a post shared by MONALISA (@aslimonalisa) on May 13, 2017 at 8:00am PDT China on Friday said it was 'close contacts' with India over its decision to block New Delhi's attempt to declare Masood Azhar, the leader of Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, as a UN terrorist
 Is made in china ke videsh mantralay kaa bayaanchin ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa hong lee ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘china sabhi tarah ke aatankwaad kaa virodh karata he or sabhi deshon ke saath vyavhaarik sahyog badhaane kaa icchhuk he
 "when he was asked about the statement of Indian Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar that India has raised the issue of Azhar with China, Li said," In the context of listing in the 1267 sanctions committee, we have always based on facts and It has taken steps according to the rules and regulations of the United Nations
 ’bharat ke sampark menunhone kaha, ‘hamane is mudde par bharat sahit sabhi deshon ke saath hameshaa nikat sampark rakhaa
 Jaishankar said this week that India has raised the issue with China at a 'high level'
 china ne ye diya tha tarkdarasal, pichley saptaah china ne sanyukt raashtra kii pratibandh samiti ko ajahar ko aatankwaadi ghoshit karne se yah kehete hue roak diya tha ki ‘yah maamla suraksha parishad kii jaruraton ko puraa nahin karata he
 'this is not the first time China has obstructed India's efforts to declare Pakistan's terrorist group and its leaders as terrorists by the United Nations
 bharat ke prayaas safal nahin ho paaesamyukt raashtra ne 2001 main jaish e mohammad ko to pratibandhit kar diya tha, lekin 2008 ke mumbai aatanki hamale ke baad ajahar par pratibandh lagane ke bharat ke prayaas safal nahin ho paae kyonki vito shaktiyon se las china ne pakistan ke ishaare par aisa hone nahin diya tha
 In July last year, China had also obstructed India's efforts in the same way that the United Nations take action against Pakistan on the release of Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi, the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack

 He requested the state government to organize and connect Muslim youths and their families in Kolkata by organizing workshops and programs to sensitize them on gender issues, to comply with the law and to realize civic obligations
 mamata banerjee ko likhe patr kaa masauda taiyaar karne vaale sanchaar visheshgy mudaar patherya ne kaha ki sarkaar ko votbank kii raajnneeti chhodkar, aane vaali pidiyon ke behatar bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue muddon kaa samaadhaan karnaa chahie
 She said, the moment she starts doing this, i believe that things will start changing positively
 ' patr par hastakshar karne vaali poshanvid (nutrishanist) neha hafeez ne kaha ki yah dharna badale jane kii jarurat he ki samudaay ko 'dusron kii apeksha zyada vishesh laabh mil rahaa he

 ' dilli nagar nigam ne kii kai ghoshnaayenkaarobaariyon ko ceiling se raahat milegicageriwal sarkaar kii tarj par ab dilli nagar nigam ne kai ghoshnaaen kii he
 Under this, traders will also get relief from sealing
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) netaa vijay goyal ne bataaya ki ab ceiling kii talwaar se dilli ke gharelu udyogon ko raahat milegi
 Small business up to 11 kw and a maximum of 9 labors will be exempt from sealing
 iske saath hi trade license ke liye ab zyada kaagajon kii jarurat nahin he
 Now people of illegal colonies will also be able to get trade licenses
 yani ab ab coloniyon main bhi chote udyog khole ja sakenge
 Along with this, Vijay Goyal said that without a NOC of the Municipal Corporation for a house up to 500 square meters in Abdilli, any architect can get a house built by uploading it online in the corporation's website
 ab tak 150 varg meter tak ke makaanon ke liye chhot thi
 Let me tell you that recently, the Supreme Court had reprimanded the Central and State Government for sealing in Delhi
 court ne kaha ki centre or dilli sarkaar sahit praadhikaran dilli ke prashasan par lard rahe hai
 They do not care about the people living in Delhi and it is a very sad situation

 He threw the luggage, turned around, raised his hands in the air and then went backwards

 Sonia Gandhi's Congress has now transformed into Rahul Gandhi's Congress, then a big change has also come with data analysis
 pehle rahul ne computer vibhaag ko aadhuniktaa dete hue data vishleshan vibhaag banaaya or mumbai kii ek nami company ke data vaigyanik praveen chakravarti ko iskaa chayaraman bana diya
 Praveen himself hails from Tamil Nadu
 iske baad data vishleshan vibhaag ne data ke jariye tamaam jaankariyaan alaakaman ko uplabdh karai hai, jiskaa pehla phayda party ko madhya pradesh main hua he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the fake voter list was initially caught by the same department, which the state president Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijay knocked in the Election Commission after doing full homework
 darasal, puure desh bhar ke matadaataaon kaa data base ikattha karke aapas main milan karne par ye gadabadi saamne aayi qi madhya pradesh main ek hi tasviir ke kai-kai voter ai di bane hai
 Later this figure reached close to 60 lakhs, while such malfunctions were not found on a large scale in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 upar se nahin booth level par ho dhyancongress ke data vishleshan vibhaag kaa maananaa he ki data ke zariye booth str kaa vishleshan aasaan he or uske jariye ranneeti bananaa bhi aasaan
 By analyzing about 600 voters, you can strategize in the election
 booth se shuru karke block, vidhansabha or phir loksabhaa kaa puraa vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 There can also be a target on how many votes to raise in the booth
 data base ke mutabik, puraa desh yaa ek loksabhaa par upar se dekhne kii bajaay neeche se booth se shuruyaat kerani hogi
 Assuming the need to convert the vote share into a seat, analysis of the data shows that the Congress does not get the seats according to the votes it gets
 karnataka kaa udhaaharan dete hue bataaya gaya ki kaise 104 siten jitkar sabase party bani bijepi 33 siton par jamaanat nahin bachaa pai
 The data analysis team believes that seeing the defeat in booths on these seats, BJP shifted its vote to JDS, thereby winning the Congress
 sirf old mysore main hi bijepi ne 33 main se 30 siton par jamaanat ganvaa di, jahaan muqabla congress or jedies main tha
 Therefore, this should be taken care of in view of the booth-wise analysis of the Congress and other opposition parties
 iske alaava ye bhi ahm he ki sabase zyaada kareeb 38 fisad vot vaali congress kaise 78 siton par simat gai
 The data team believes that analysis of the data suggests that this was to happen
 booth str ke data ke vishleshan se mili binduon par nazar rakhte hue vot ko zyaada se zyaada seat main kaise tabdeel kiya jaae
 In this regard, the data team has also given suggestions at the booth level, which are completely based on data analysis
 kairana main congress kaa 8 fisadi vot hua bijepi ko shiftdata team ne kairana ko lekar ek or chaunkaane vaala khulaasa kiya he
 According to him, the Congress won 8 percent of the vote in Kairana when it was a candidate for the Grand Alliance, which is why the BJP lost by close to 44 thousand votes
 data team kaa ye aankada congress kii ek seat vipaksh kaa ek ummidavaar kii ranneeti par bhi sawaal khadaa karata he
 Actually, data analysis shows that if there are many seats where Congress does not contest, then some percentage of its vote may shift to BJP
 isliye sidhe gathjod kii bajaay ranneeti ke tahat gathbandhan karnaa chahie
 The data team has analyzed all the big and small elections since 2009
 iske mutabik jis tarah 2009 se congress 206 se ghatakar 2014 main 44 par aa gai, usee tarah 2014 se ab tak ke chote-bade chunaavon kaa data vishleshan bataata he ki aaj kii taarikh main bijepi 282 se ghatakar 201 par aa pahunchi he or yahi trend rahaa to wo 2019 main 160 siten hi laa sakegi
 At the same time, the Congress will be closer to 140 in this 2019
 data team ne congress kaa teen tareeke se vishleshan kiya he
 First, where there is a contest between Congress and NDA
 doosraa, jahaan gathbandhan main congress bade partner ke taur par endie se mukaable main he or teesraa, jahaan congress junior partner ke taur par gathbandhan main endie se mukaable main hai
 According to the data, in the first two, the Congress seems to win around 120, while in the third, 20 seats are seen in its account
 kul milakar siyasat main data kii entry to puraani he, lekin rahul kam se kam congress main rashtriya str par isko khangalkar 2019 main modi se bhidane kii ranneeti ko or dhar denge
 Yes, it is interesting how much data dominates in Rahul's politics, whether it is a loss deal or profit
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli ke ek paanch sitara hotel main italy main bane 24 kaartoos or do magazine baraamad hone kaa maamla prakaash main aayaa he
 The police gave information about it here today

 After they left the room, the AC mechanic found cartridges in a polythene bag
 police ke anusaar in donon italvi nagarikon ko pune or mumbai se giraftaar kar liya he
 Vijay Bahuguna, who joined BJP after rebelling from the Congress, has broken the silence on the news of sister Rita Bahuguna Joshi joining BJP
 vijay bahuguna ne 'aaj tak' se kaha ki ve ek-duusare kii raajnneeti main dakhal nahin dete lekin ve bahan ko samajhaayenge ki congress kaa bhavishya andhakaarmay he, rahul ke netritv main congress dub rahi he
 'only BJP is the option' Vijay Bahuguna said that he will meet his sister tonight, explain to them how the future of Congress is in darkness
 aaj sirf bijepi hi vikalp he
 He further said, 'I say this to the Congressman whom i meet
 ' bahuguna bole ki unki or bahan kii raajnneeti alag-alag pradeshon main rahi he
 But they do not interfere in each other's politics
 unhone apni bahenrita bahugunako bataaya tha ki kin halaat main unhone congress chhod kar bijepi jwine kii he
 Annoyed with Sonia's leadership, Balan Bahuluna, who was angry with Balancerahul Gandhi, said that there was a good relationship between him and Bahi
 unhone kaha ki sonia ke netritv main balance he, lekin rahul balance nahin rakhte hai, balki khud ek gut kaa saath dete dikhte hai
 In such a situation, the party has to be in bad shape
 bataa den ki isi saal june maheene main congress chhod bijepi main shaamil hue the
 Bahuguna along with 8 rebel mlas from Uttarakhand and the BJP also joined hands with the BJP
 varisht mantri ajam khan kii naaraazgi or ek tarah se mantri pad se hataa dene kii chunauti dene ke baad uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne unhen meerut jile kaa prabhaar pun: saunp diya
 a senior official of the Uttar Pradesh government said that the Chief Minister has decided to make Khan the minister in-charge of Meerut again
 sutron ne bataaya ki is aashay kaa nirnay sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ke hastkshep ke baad liya gaya
 It is noteworthy that the SP leader Azam Khan, upset with the removal of the post of the minister in-charge of Meerut, wrote a letter to the Chief Minister of the state asking him to be removed as a cabinet minister if he disqualified him as a minister
 sapa sutron ke anusaar rajya ke nagar vikaas mantri khan ne pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko bheje gayi patr main kaha he ki agar vah unke kaamkaaj se santusht nahin hai to unhen pad se hataa diya janaa chaiye
 Party sources had said that after the withdrawal of the charge of Meerut district, Khan had disassociated himself from the responsibility of the minister in-charge of Ghaziabad and Muzaffarnagar districts
 meerut ke prabharee ke pad se hathaaye jane ko anupyukt qaraar dete hue khan ne dilli main kaha ki unhone mukhyamantri ko patr likhaa he lekin is baat se inkaar kiya ki unhone istife keepeshkash kii thi
 He said how can i say anything that i have not done
 main yahaan sarkaar ko kamjor karne ke liye nahin hum
 In fact, those who are leaking such communication to the media, are weakening the government
 khan ne patr main mukhyamantri se kaha tha ki vah in donon jilon kaa prabhaar kisi aise mantri ko de den jo unase zyada kaabil ho
 Significantly, Panchayati Raj Minister Balram Yadav was given the charge of Meerut from Azam Khan, while Khan was given the responsibility of the minister in charge of Pilibhit in lieu of Meerut
 baharhaal, aaj din main hi mukhyamantri akhilesh ne kanpur main kaha tha ki khan kii naaraazgi kii khabaren akhabaaron ne badha-chadha kar chhaapi hai or sarkaar ke saath unki koi naaraazgi nahin he
 In the case of gang-rape of five activists of an NGO in Khunti district adjoining Ranchi, 12 people including a pastor have been questioned by the police

 The victimized minor girls had come to the remote village two days ago to do street plays
 police ke mutabik usee vakt patthalgadi samarthakon ne unka apharan kar unke saath rape kiya
 There is already tension in the area of the village of Kochang, about fifty kilometers from the Khunti headquarters
 khunti kaa yah ilaaka naksal prabhavit he

 In such a situation, the police also refrain from visiting these areas

 osama yusuf jaish ke sabase sakriy cmanderon main se ek he jo ab tak afghanistan main tha
 Osama Balakot is also in charge of the Jaish Center in Mansehra
 sutron ke mutabik pakistan sialkot sector se osama kii ghuspaith karana chahta he
 The terrorist has also been the commander of the center of the Jaish stronghold of Osman Valley in Bahawalpur
 ghuspaith kii firaaq main 50 aatankijaish sargana masood azhar pehle bhi apane rishtedaaron ko kashmir main aatank failaane ke liye bhej chukaa he lekin surakshabalon ne unka khaatmaa kar diya
 The Indian Army has already killed Masood Azhar's nephew, his bodyguard and nephew
 in aatankiyon kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye masood azhar kai baar aatankiyon ko kashmir bhej chukaa he lekin sabhi oparation ol out ke dauraan surakshabalon ke encounter main dher kar die gaye
 Now Masood Azhar wants to infiltrate into India 50 other terrorists trended in Balakot
 aapako bataa den ki moulana masood ajahar apane aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa garh balakot main chalaa rahaa tha
 The center was destroyed by an air strike by India, but after that Pakistan has once again revived the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot and Mansehra
 aatanki vaardaaton kaa akajaish-e-mohammad bharat hi nahin america, england, australia or canada main bhi apni aatanki gatividhiyon ko anjaam de chukaa he
 The United Nations has already blacklisted this organization, but despite all restrictions, this terrorist organization has been flourishing in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) for years
 masood ajahar apni bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ke chalate janaa jaataa he
 For years Pakistan refused to believe that Masood Azhar was in his country
 lekin haal hi main pakistan ne yah maan liya tha ki masood ajahar kii tabiyat kharaab he or wo pakistan main hi he
 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow
 bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ke ghatak shivasena ke saansad raut ne siem yogi se mulaakaat ke dauraan 16 june ko shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare or party saansadon ke ayodhya daure ke sambandh main charchaa kii
 Significantly, Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to reach Ayodhya on 16 June along with party mps
 loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle november main bhi shivasena supremeo ne ayodhya kaa daura kiya tha
 Now, while he is standing at the mouth of another election, he has once again turned to Ayodhya
 november maah main apane daure ke dauraan thakare ne ayodhya main yojit dharm sansad ke manch se centre sarkaar ke khilaaf talkh tevar dikhaate hue kaha tha ki ram mandir kaa shrey lene nahin, iske nirmaan kii taarikh jaanane ke liye ayodhya aayaa hum
 Kumbhakarni, while awakening the sleeping government to sleep, said that the purpose of his visit to Ayodhya was that the whole country is waiting for the construction of Ram temple
 uddhav ne siem yogi ke bayaan ko aadhaar banaakar kaha tha ki vah kehete hai ki vahaan mandir tha, he or rahegaa
 But our belief is that if there is a temple, it should also be seen
 thakare ne tab keval chunaav ke samay hi mandir mudda uthaane or iske baad koi prayaas nahin karne ke liye bijepi kii jamkar aalochana kii thi
 The Lok Sabha elections, when the Shiv Sena chief, who had always promised to visit Uddhav Ayodhya, now going to Ayodhya before the Maharashtra Assembly elections, came a few months away
 ab jabaki vah ek baar phir ayodhya ja rahe hai, kuch hi maah main maharashtra vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai, aise main uddhav kii yatra ke raajnneetik myne bhi nikaale jane lage hai
 Some are describing it as an exercise to return the Shiv Sena to an old track of hard Hindutva, while some seek to regain the lost elder brother's role in Maharashtra
 gauratlab he ki ram mandir andolan main shivasena kii bhi sakriy bhoomika maani jaati he
 Shiv Sena, riding on the wave of Hindutva, also had its benefits in Maharashtra
 party maharashtra kii raajnneeti main majbootee se ubhari thi

 In fact, Tharoor (shashi Tharoor) wrote on Twitter three lions that were like - 'who will love Khuda Ki Mohabbat ko? If all the people are noble, then who will commit the crime? o God, keep my friends safe, or who will pray for my safety and keep my enemies safe, or who will pray for me to come to you

 So many great lines

 After this, many people tweeted and gave information to Shashi Tharoor, including Javed Akhtar
 javed akhtar (javed Akhtar) ne twit kar kaha, 'shashi ji, jis kisi ne aapako ye line di hai usapar kabhi bharosa mat kijiega
 It is clear that someone has put these lines in your shoes with the intention of destroying your literary reputation
 'shashi ji , who ever has given you these lines should never be trusted again 
 It is obvious that some one had planted these lines in your repertoire to sabotage you literary credibility
 haalanki baad main shashi tharur ko apni galati kaa ehsaas hua or unhone maafee maangi
 Tharoor tweeted and said 'ghalib is my favorite, but today is not his birthday
 mujhe galat jaankaree di gai thi
 'tharoor further tagged Javed Akhtar in his tweet, writing,' Thanks to Javed Akhtar and other friends who made me realize my mistake
 'thanks to @javedakhtarjadu & other friends, i realize I've been had
 The lines are not Ghalib's
 Just as every clever quote is attributed to Winston Churchill even if he never said it, so it seems that whenever people like a shayari, they credit Ghalib for it! Apologies
 Shashi Tharoor said that the way every good coat is told of Winston Churchill, even if they have not said it, just like when people like a poetry, they associate it with Ghalib
 main maafee chahta hum
 Please tell that in response to this tweet of Shashi Tharoor, many more people also shared wrong shayari in the name of Ghalib

 com / rexzafkzdr The Supreme Court, in its judgment, dismissed a petition filed by one 60-year-old petitioner for euthanasia
 yah nurse mumbai ke ek aspataal main barbartapurna duraachaar ke baad 37 saal se behoshee kii haalat main he
 a bench of Justice Markandey Katju and Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra dismissed the petition filed on behalf of KEM Hospital nurse Aruna Ramchandra Shanbag, saying that although 'active euthanasia' (euthanasia in which the patient's life was ended by an injection, etc
) Is illegal), yet in exceptional circumstances 'passive euthanasia' (euthanasia, when the patient is stopped treatment Security should be removed from the life-saving equipment) permission can be granted
 ’’sheersh adaalat ne kaha ki aruna ke maamle main tathy or paristhitiyaan chikitsa sakshya tathaa anya saamagree se pataa chalata he ki peedit ko ichhamrityu die jane kii jarurat nahin he
 The bench, however, said that as there is currently no law on euthanasia in the country, a patient with a dying condition can be given "passive euthanasia in exceptional cases"
 ’’ peeth ne spasht kiya ki jab tak sansad kanoon nahin banaati, tab tak iskaa faisla ichhamrityu ke donon tareekon (active or pasive yuthensia) par lagu rahegaa
 Now 60 years old, Aruna was brutally attacked on 27 November 1973 at the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai by an employee of the hospital itself
 aruna ko ichhamrityu dene ke liye lekhika pinki viraani ne yachika daayar kii thi
 He told the court that a sanitation worker at the hospital wrapped a dog chain in Aruna's neck and slammed it, leaving her in a coma
 yachika ke anusaar is karmchaaree ne peedit se balaatkaar karne kii koshish kii, lekin yah jaanane ke baad ki vah masik dharm se he, usne nurse ke saath aprakritik dushkarm kiya
 Aruna could not resist, so the accused wrapped the chain with her neck and knocked her
 jaghanya aparaadh ko anjaam dene ke baad vah maukey se faraar ho gaya
 Virani said that due to strangulation, the supply of oxygen to Aruna's brain was stopped and her cartex was damaged
 greeva rajju main chot ke saath hi mastishk nalikaaon main bhi andruni chot pahunchi
 According to the petitioner, Aruna has lost a lot of weight in the last 37 years after the incident and her bones have broken
 bistar par pade rahane ke kaaran uski twachaa main sankraman ho gaya he
 His creations have turned inward, teeth have been destroyed and he can only be given chilled food
 unhone kaha ki aruna lagaataar behoshee kii haalat main he
 His brain is actually dead and he has no interest in the world
 yachikakarta ne aruna ke liye ichhamrityu kii maang karte hue kaha ki na to vah sun sakati he na dekh sakati he or na hi kisi bhi tarah se khud ko vyakt kar sakati he
 The bench reserved its decision after hearing arguments from various parties on the issue
 ichhamrityu kii anumati dene ke vivaadaaspad mudde par tark dene waalon main atarni general jeei vaahnavati adaalat kii madad ke liye niyukt vakil tiaar andhyarugina aspataal kii ore se ballab sisodiya or yachikakarta viraani kii ore se pesh shekhar nafade shaamil rahe
 During the cross-examination, the government took the stand that there is no provision of euthanasia either legally or constitutionally
 sisodiya ne yachika kaa yah kahkar virodh kiya ki aspataal ke karmi khaskar doctor or norsen pichley 37 saal se aruna kii kaaphi acchhee dekhbhaal kar rahe hai or ve use maare jane ke aagrah ke khilaaf hai

 vahiin, sarkaar ne mukhya vipakshi party bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) par aarope lagaaya ki vah vidheyak ko paarit na karaane ke liye bahaane bana rahi he
 Beginning the discussion, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that the bill is weak but the House should not step back without passing an effective Lokpal Bill
 vahiin, jetali ke sawaalon kaa jawaab satta paksh kii ore se congress ke abhishek manu singhvi ne diya
 Singhvi accused the BJP of making excuses for not passing the bill
 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke satish chandra mishra ne kaha ki kendri jaanch beuro (sibiai) sarkaar ke adheen nahin rahani chahie
 Whereas the Communist Party of india-marxist (CPI-M) leader Sitaram Yechury called the bill introduced weak
 centre main lokapal or rajyon main lokayukta sanstha ke gathan kaa praaroop dene vaale vidheyak par charchaa ke baad mat vibhaajan hoga
 It may be noted that Congress and its allies number 92 in a House of 243 members, while the government needs the support of 122 members to get the bill passed
 sarkaar ko ummid he ki vidheyak paarit karne main basapa or sapa uskaa sahyog karengi

 unhone vidheyak main alpsankhyak cote kii vyavastha karne or lokapal ke daayre se kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko baahar rakhane par aapatti uthaai
 Jaitley told the government that if she wants the bill to be passed in the upper house, she should accept the bjp's amendments
 jetali ne vidheyak ke prayek bhaag par sawaal kiye or kaha ki sarkaar ne aisa lokapal banaaya he jo sanvaidhanik kasautiyon ke lihaaj se kamjor he
 He said that the provision of the bill which makes it mandatory for the states to appoint Lokayukta on the ideals of the central government, is not clear and the powers of the Center and the state will collide with each other
 vahiin, singhvi ne jetali ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya or poocha ki moolbhoot sawaal yah he ki aap lokapal vidheyak paas karwaanaa chaahate hai yaa nahin? While appearing for the government in the House, Singhvi also accused the BJP of not being clear on the issue
 singhvi ne kaha, "bhaajapa najuk sthiti main vidheyak main roda atka rahi he or vah kah rahi he ki vah majboot or samgr vidheyak chaahati he
 She is using this situation as an excuse for not passing the bill
 " unhone kaha, "yadi aap vidheyak paas nahin karwaanaa chaahate hai to aisa kiijie or bahaane chhodane kaa himmat dikhaaiye
 " congress netaa ne kaha, "sibiai 70 saal puraani sanstha he
 Will every institution be automatically destroyed by the arrival of Lokpal? " singhvi ne kaha ki bhaajapa acolpaneey anupaat vaala ek vishalkay satta banani chaahati he jiske saamne pradhanmantri karyaalay 'bouna' jaisaa dikhe
 He said, "you want a Lokpal and you want the CVC, CBI, Citizen Charter to be brought under its purview
 aap yah bhi chaahate hai ki lokapal ke paas swat: sangyaan lene kii shakti ho
 The Ombudsman should conduct the primary inquiry, after that the Ombudsman should also investigate and he should also have the responsibility to prosecute

 jin dardanaak kahaniyon ko ham aapke paas lekar aae hai un sabhi main in kaidiyon ke jurm sabit nahin ho sake or saalon baad unhen reeha kiya gaya
 This is the story of those Indians who were incarcerated in prison without committing any crime
 pakistani ladki se pyaar karne kii mili sajaa
 
 
 Javed Ahmed of Rampur spent more than 11 years of his life in jail
 lekin unhone aisa koi gunaah nahin kiya jiske liye unhen is tarah kii sajaa di jaae
 Javed's fault was that he fell in love with a Pakistani girl
 javed kishoravastha main jail gaye the or ab unki umr 35 saal ho chuki he
 Javed is a TV mechanic by profession
 javed ne apane dard ko kuch is tarah bayaan kiya- 'chote-chote gharon kii jagah ab imaaraten hai
 The temporary market has now replaced the temporary shops
 jo log cycle chalaate the aaj unke paas motorcycle he or jo us samay motorcycle par ghoomte the wo chaar pahiyaa le chuke hai
 i think i lagged far behind
 'javed aaj bhi us sadame se ubar nahin paae hai, jail se chhootane ke baad se tivi maikenic ke rup main kaam karne vaale javed ne kaha ki aaj bhi unka ateet unhen chaiyn se jeene nahin detaa he
 They feel that this was not the right time for the lovestory between India and Pakistan
 javed ke mutabik, 'aaj mujhe is baat kaa ehsaas hota he ki jab 2002 main mujhe police ne pakadaa tha tab bharat or pakistan ke bich rishte kaaphi kharaab the
 The Kargil War ended shortly before
 aaj mujhe lagata he ki mujhe us samay us ladki ko phone nahin karnaa chahie tha
 i was caught on suspicion
 us samay bahut kam log pakistan phone kiya karte the
 'how the love story started'
 
 
 1999 main ek ore us samay ke pradhanmantri atal bihari bajpeyi donon deshon ke bich shanti kaayam karne kii koshish kar rahe the vahiin duusari ore pakistan bharat kii peeth main chura ghonpane ke liye taiyaar tha
 Like the Prime Minister and all the people of the country, Javed and his family also did not know what was going to happen in Kargil
 donon deshon ke bich sudharte rishton ko dekhte hue javed or uske parivaar ne apane rishtedaaron se milane ke liye pakistan jane kaa plan banaaya
 Meanwhile, Javed made the first phone call to his relative's house in Pakistan
 or mobina ne phone risive kiya
 Remembering that time, Javed said- 'when i talked to him, i felt that he was in front of me and i am talking with him
 uske baad main pakistan janaa chahta tha
 About a month and a half after that phone call, i also went to Pakistan
 vahiin main usase pehali baar mila tha
 She was even more beautiful than what i thought
 'nahin raji hue uske gharavaale
 
 
 Javed lived in Karachi for two and a half months and there was a beginning of love between them
 usee dauraan donon deshon ke bich kargil par tanaav badha
 When Javed was returning to Rampur from Karachi, he promised Mobina that he would keep calling her
 javed rampur to waapas aa gaye lekin mobina ke saath unka rishta or majboot ho gaya
 Both used to talk on the phone and also wrote letters
 2001 main javed duusari baar karachi gaya or is baar wo mobina se shaadi karke use rampur laana chahta tha lekin mobina kaa parivaar is par raji nahin hua
 In September 2002, Javed's life changed forever; Javed told- 'he did not want to let his daughter go to India
 main apane parivaar ko rampur main nahin chhod kar rah saktaa tha lekin maine himmat nahin haari
 'till September 2002, the two continued to talk on the phone, but a date came in this month that changed Javed's life forever
 javed bataate hai- 'ek tata suumo ai or mujhe usamen daalkar le jaaya gaya
 All this happened in a hurry
 mujhe kuch pataa nahin tha ki mere saath kya ho rahaa he
 When i recovered from this shock, i saw that there were people in the car with me who came to my shop as clients
 wo sade kapade main the lekin unke paas hathiyaar the
 Till they did not cover my face, i found that i am in Ghaziabad, after that they covered my face
 'pyaar kaa ye anjaam to javed ne kabhi sochaa bhi nahin hoga
 It is from here that the black page of Javed's life started
 javed ne bataaya- '3 dinon tak lagaataar wo mujhe torchar karte rahe
 It seemed that those people wanted to kill me
 uske baad unhone diary par kuch likhaa or mere anguuthe kaa nishaan le liya
 Sections 121, 121 a and 123 of IPC were levied against Javed
 javed ke vakil jalaalaluddin khan ke mutabik, 'saboot ke taur par unke paas javed ke likhe hue khat the jo pakistan bheje gaye the
 In addition, the photo was a handmade map
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki javed army movement ke bare main fax messej ke jariye pakistan ko soochna detaa tha
 He had studied till class four and could not do anything in this matter
 'ek pita kaa dard
 
 
 Javed's family was also shocked
 javed ke pita mohammad shafiq ne bataaya- 'jab usko pehali baar le gaye the wo log to ham 5 dinon tak rote rahe
 There was no one in Rampur who did not know me
 mujhe shame aa rahi thi ki mere bete par itane gambhir aarope lage the
 Two of Javed's friends were also arrested from Rampur
 javed kii giraftaar ke dedh maheene baad uske khilaaf pota laga diya gaya
 After this Javed went sunk into this swamp
 javed ne bataaya- 'main apane khat ke ant main 'J' likhata tha or wo 'M' likhti thi
 The police felt that we were sharing secret information in the codeword
 ' javed ke pita kehete hai- 'pyaar karnaa jurm nahin he lekin mere bete ke liye ye jurm ho gaya kyonki usne ek pakistani ladki se pyaar kiya tha
 'javed was left behind in eleven and a half years
 
 
 11
 After 5 years in jail, he was released due to lack of evidence
 lekin javed jab waapas rampur laute to sabakuch badal chukaa tha
 Javed, released from jail in January this year, says- 'I still have full faith in love
 uske bare main sochna mere liye bahut jaruri he
 But my soul is dead
 main pakistan nahin janaa chahta
 Nor can i think of calling him
 ' aaj bhale hi javed jail ke baahar aa chuke hai lekin unki jindagi ab pehle jaise nahin rah gai he

 The education minister of the state has formed a team of officials to prepare lessons on the life of Narendra Modi
 agle shiksha satr main teesri se chhathi kaksha ke chaatro ko rajya sarkaar ke sarkari skulon main modi kii jeevani padhai jaaegi
 The Congress has opposed this saying that children studying Modi's life will learn hatred
 rajasthan ke schuli bacchon ko ab tak swatantraaa senaniyon or divangat purv pradhanmantriyon ke jivan ke bare main padhaayaa jaataa rahaa he lekin ye pehali baar ho rahaa he ki ek pradhanmantri pad ke ghoshit ummidwar or duusare rajya ke jivit mukhyamantri ko schuli shiksha ke paathyakram main shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 The Government of Rajasthan has decided to teach the life of Narendra Modi to all government schools from third to sixth standard
 paathyakram agle satr main shaamil kiya jayega or isse pehle iske liye adhikariyon kii ek team bani he jo paath taiyaar karenge
 The government says that this will give encouragement to the students of Rajasthan for the struggle

 However, opposition to this decision of the Rajasthan government has also started
 congress ne ise chatukaarita kii paraakaashtha bataate hue kaha he ki narendra modi kii jeevani pard kar bachche nafrat se bhar jaaenge
 Rajasthan Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma opposed the government's move, saying, "this is the culmination of sycophancy"
 ye to abhi pradhanmantri bane hi nahin or divaswapan dekh rahe hai
 Here those are included whose chapter has ended
 or phir modi kaa kaala adhyay he, to bacchon ko kya nafrat sikhayenge
 "but the big question is why Narendra Modi is there to teach the children? Why BJP says that when Nehru and Indira can become part of the curriculum, why not Modi
" saaf he is par vivaad hoga
 In Rajasthan, elections of politically important urban bodies and panchayats are to be held by February next year, in which Modi's name will only work through controversies

 In this sequence, the government has banned jamaat-e-islami, an organization working in Jammu and Kashmir, for 5 years
 grih mantralay ne cabinet cameti on security ke baad yah faisla liya he
 In such a situation, it is interesting for you to know what is jamaat-e-islami (jammu and Kashmir) and what is the work done by this organization that the government had to ban it
 
 
 jamaat-e-islamic (jammu-kashmir) ke bare main bataane se pehle aapako bataate hai ki aakhir isaki neenv kahaan padi
 Before the independence, an organization was formed in the year 1941, whose name was jamaat-e-islami
 jamaat-e-islamic kaa gathan islamic dharamshastri moulana abul alaa maududi ne kiya tha or yah islam kii vichaardhaara ko lekar kaam karata tha
 However after independence it was divided into several different organizations, including jamaat-e-islami Pakistan and jamaat-e-islami Hind
 haalanki jamaat-e-islamic se prabhavit hokar kai or sanghathan bhi bane, jisamen jamaat-e-islamic bangladesh, kashmir, britain or afghanistan aadi pramukh hai
 jamaat-e-islami parties maintain relations internationally with other Muslim groups
 kya he jamaat-e-islamic (jammu-kashmir)jamaat-e-islamic (jammu-kashmir) kii ghati kii raajnneeti ahm bhoomika he or saal 1971 se isane sakriy raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 After not winning a single seat in the first election, he did well in the subsequent elections and made a significant place in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki ab ise jammu kashmir main algaavvaadi vichaardhaara or aatankwaadi maansikta ke prasar ke liye pramukh jimmedaar sanghathan mana jaataa he
 It is believed that Hizbul Mujahideen is the right hand man of the terrorist organization and the Hizbul Mujahideen has been raised by the jamaat-e-islami Jammu Kashmir
 hijbul mujahidin ko is sanghathan ne har tarah kii sahaayta kii
 Please tell that even before this organization has been banned twice
 pehali baar jammu kashmir sarkaar ne is sanghathan ko 1975 main 2 saal ke liye bain kiya tha, jabaki duusari baar centre sarkaar ne 1990 main ise bain kiya tha
 The ban was continued till December 1993
 jamaat-e-islamic hind se alag he yah sanghathanayah jamaat-e-islamic hind se bilkul alag sanghathan he
 It has nothing to do with that organization
 saal 1953 main jamaat-e-islamic ne apana alag samvidhan bhi bana liya tha
 jamaat-e-islami (jammu and Kashmir) contests in the Valley, but the jamaat-e-islami Hind is an organization that works for welfare
 jamaat-e-islamic hind ke desh main swasthya or shiksha se jude bhi kai kaary karata rahaa he
 Why Ban? jamaat-e-islami is the main organization responsible for spreading separatist ideology and terrorist mentality in Jammu and Kashmir
 grih mantralay ke sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik jamaat-e-islamic aatankiyon ko trend karnaa, unhen fund karnaa, sharan dena, logistic muhaiyaa karnaa aadi kaam kar rahaa tha
 It is considered the militant wing of jamaat-e-islami Jammu and Kashmir
 vahiin ise aatankwaadi ghatnaon ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Works in the Kashmir Valley under its separatist ideology and Pakistani agenda
 ye sanghathan algaavvaadi, aatankwaadi tatwon kaa vaicharik samarthan karata he
 He has also been very helpful in his anti-national activities
 yah bhi jaankaree mili he ki wo bharat se alag dharm par aadhaarit ek swatantra islamic rajya kii sthapana ke liye prayaas kar rahaa he
 Due to these antics of jamaat-e-islami, a step has been taken to ban it
