 vidhansabha adhyaksh dwaara 16 vidhayakon ko ayogy qaraar die jane se yediurppa ke liye bahumat sabit karnaa aasaana ho gaya
 Just before this crucial moment, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly had disqualified 16 mlas

 Earlier, a constitutional war broke out before the government's power test in Karnataka

 In the letter, the Governor had asked the Speaker of the Assembly, Bopaiah, to refrain from canceling the membership of the rebel mlas
 unhone likhaa ki vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karnaa loktantric prakriya ke saath chhedchhad hogi
 This letter of the Governor has been termed as interference in the functioning of the Speaker by the Speaker

 isse pehle vidhansabha adhyaksh ne bijepi ke 11 baagi vidhayakon se notice jari kar poocha tha ki dal-badal kanoon ke tahat unki sadsyta kyon na khatm kar di jaae
 The ruckus started on this notice a post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@isapnachaudhary) on Sep 16, 2018 at 11:08am PDTA post shared by Sapna Choudhary (@isapnachaudhary) on Sep 15, 2018 at 1:40am PDT There is now only one phase of the long process of Lok Sabha elections
 centre main agali sarkaar kiski banegi? iskaa faisla 23 may ko aayega
 Earlier, with the last phase of voting on May 19, the curtain will fall on the five-week marathon election in the world's largest democracy
 19 may ko matdaan kii aakhri taarikh or matganana kii taarikh 23 may ke bich aapako darjanon chunaav uparaant survey yaa agsit pole dekhne ko milenge
 But you should be prepared to see the go-to and reliable India Today - Axis My India post-poll survey
 jaaniye kyon?2013 se 2018 ke bich desh main jitne bhi chunaav hue hai, unamem se 95% main india today-exis maai india chunaav uparaant surveykshan sahi anumaan lagane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Since 2013, Axis My India has conducted 36 post-poll surveys out of which an accurate estimate of the winning party / coalition in 34 came out
 is baar 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye india today-exis maai india or badi taiyaari ke saath saamne aa rahaa he
 This election survey will be shown on the evening of May 19 on India Today TV and Aaj Tak
 is survey main 542 loksabhaa kshetron main 8 lakh votaron ne hissaa liya
 This makes it the country's largest post-election survey
 safalataa kaa mantrastik aankade saamne laane ke liye samarpit walantirs ke saath hi kathin quality control checks kii zarurat hoti he
 It is given special attention in the India today-axis My India post-poll survey
 35 dinon main (buudhvaar tak) saat lakh votaron kaa survey kiya ja chukaa he
 Voters will also join the survey till the last phase of voting is completed on May 19
 exis maai india ke nideshak pradeep gupta bataate hai ki kaise wo lambey samay se sateek survey karte aane main safal rahe hai
 Gupta told India Today, "the basis of the success rate is that we take samples from every field
 jamini str par maujuud 500 se zyaada or acchhee tarah prashikshit walantirs kaa chayan kadi bhartee prakriya se guzarane ke baad kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, mobile management provides live tracking of volunteers and random sample testing on a day to day basis, which makes poll study more reliable and reliable
 ”data kii gunvattta ko hari jhandi milane ke baad ucch str par vishleshak aankadon ko khangalate hai
 In the same process, Pradeep Gupta himself decodes the emerging trends
 sateek anumaanon kaa itihasindia today ne 2015 main bihar chunaav ke baad se exis maai india ke saath haath milaayaa
 Even before this, Axis My India has a good record of accurate estimation
 20132013 main exis maai india ne chaar vidhansabha chunaavon main post pole survey kiye or chaaron main hi inke anumaan sahi sabit hue
 Axis My India speculated that the BJP would form the government in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and this assumption proved to be correct
 ye anumaan bhi lagaaya gaya tha ki dilli main trishanku vidhansabha saamne aegi or asal nattejey bhi vaise hi aae
 Then for the first time, the Axis My India Post poll for the Aam Aadmi Party projected to get 27 seats
 haqiqat main aam aadmi party ko 28 seat mili
 It was a big deal to make an accurate guess about a party that had no election history before
 2014exis maai india ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye anumaan lagaaya tha ki endie purna bahumat ke saath centre main sarkaar banayega or vaisaa hi nateeja saamne aayaa
 The same success story was repeated for the four state assembly elections in 2014, along with correctly predicting the Lok Sabha election results
 Axis My India as the bjp's largest party in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana, and PDP in Jammu and Kashmir Predicted to emerge and the same results emerged
 20152015 main exis maai india ne dilli or bihar ke liye do post pole survey kiye
 It was estimated in the survey for Delhi that the Aam Aadmi Party will get an absolute majority
 exis maai india ne bihar main jediu ke sarkaar banane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha, wo bhi sahi sabit hua
 The 2016 India today-axis My India conducted post-poll surveys for four states and one union territory
 inamen se chaar sateek sabit hue
 The BJP in Assam, the LDF in Kerala, the congress-dmk alliance in Puducherry and the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal were predicted to be in the forefront
 2017india-today-exis maai india ne 7 rajyon ke liye post-pole survey kiye jo sabhi sahi sabit hue
 The survey had predicted that the BJP would emerge as the single largest party in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand
 asal nateezon main bijepi ko donon rajyon main badi jeet hasil hui
 For Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, the bjp's assumption of a majority proved to be correct
 punjab or manipur ke liye hamaare survey main congress ke leading party hone kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya, wo bhi sahi sabit hua
 The Congress was the single largest party in Manipur but stayed away from a majority
 iskaa sanket bhi hamaare post pole survey main diya gaya tha
 In fact, in Manipur, BJP managed to form a government with the help of post-poll alliance
 goa ke liye hamaare post pole survey main trishanku vidhansabha kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 This inference also turned out to be correct
 manipur kii tarah goa main bhi bijepi chunaav uparaant gathbandhan ke dam se sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 Apart from these states, our post poll survey estimates in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur also proved correct
 20182018 main 6 rajya vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye hamaare post pole survey ke anumaan sahi nikle
 Our post poll survey projected the largest party but hung assembly of Congress in Meghalaya which proved to be correct
 meghalaya main sirf do seat jeetne vaali bijepi ne sarkaar banane ke liye enpief or udipi jaise kshetreey dalon ke saath haath milaayaa
 At the same time, the Congress and its allies formed governments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 vahiin mizoram main emenef or telugana main tiares ko jeet hasil hui
 Similar estimates were expressed in the India today-axis My India survey
 sabhi 36 post pole survey main sirf do main, 2016 main tamilnadu or 2018 main karnataka main hamaare anumaan sahi nahin nikle
 On Monday, a pro-assad attacker killed 16 people, according to reports from the city of Homs, Syria

 India's former National Security Advisor (NSA) Shivshankar Menon has said that the 'real threat' to Pakistan's nuclear weapons is not from terrorist organizations, but from the volatile elements within its military

 com / 1do7sw9eb4 US President Donald Trump has said that the US will withdraw from the World Trade Organization (WTO) if conditions do not improve
 trump ne pencilvenia ke ek 'shell chemical plant' main mangalvaar ko karmchaariyon se kaha, ''agar hamen chhodana padaa to ham chhod denge
 President Trump said, "we know they have been harming us for many years, this will not happen anymore
" '' unhone dablutio ko uske pichley kai kadamon kaa zikr karte hue us par nishaanaa saadhaa he or america ko dablutio se baahar nikaalane kii dhamkee di he
 He claimed that the WTO was misbehaving with the US and said that the WTO cannot ignore Washington
 trump ne pehle bhi kai baar dablutio par america ke saath anuchit vyavhaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya he or usase hatane kii dhamkee bhi di he
 He said that Washington does not have to follow the WTO rules
 trump ne kaha ki sanghathan main shaamil kiye jane ke vakt china ko di gayi sharton ko lekar america kii shikaayat he
 He said the US had made complaints about China's theft of American technology
 lekin sanyukt rajya america ke paas vastav main vaishvik vyapaarik sanstha dwaara madhyasthata se vivaadon ko jeetne kaa ek safal record he
 Trump claims that the Trump administration effectively softened its stand whenever asked to improve the rules of the institution
 bataa den ki china ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki america kaa vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main china kaa 'vikasshil raashtra' kaa darja usase waapas lene kii chetavanee uske 'ghamand' or 'swaartheepan' ko bataata he
 China responded on Monday following a directive sent by President Donald Trump to US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer last Friday
 is nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki vyapaar niyamon kii vaishvik vyavastha kaa sanchaalan or vivaadon kaa nipataara karne vaale dablutio dwaara viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich kiya jane vaala vibhaajan ab purana pad gaya he
 As a result, some members of the WTO are taking advantage
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah nirdesh china ko dhyaan main rakhkar diya gaya he
 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press conference that this demand from the Trump administration reflects his 'arrogance' and 'selfishness'
 unhone kaha ki ek yaa kuch deshon ko yah faisla karne kaa adhikaar nahin hona chahie ki kisi desh ko vikasshil deshon kii shrenee main rakhana he or kise nahin
 Significantly, the WTO gives a long timeframe for the respective governments to fulfill free trade commitments by getting the status of a developing country in the WTO, as well as allowing such countries to protect some of their domestic industries and to continue state aid

 In the context of Sunday night's decision to give England batsman Ian Bell a closeout, Dhoni said, "the mix of technology with human thinking is bad
 yahi kaaran he ki hamen vah wicket nahin mila
 i hope next time it will be either technology or human thinking
 ’ yahaan chinnaswami stadium main bel ko maidani ampire billy bouden or tisare ampire ne naat out qaraar diya jabaki tivi riple main saaf dikh rahaa tha ki gend stump se takaraa rahi thi

 He said, "if the Hawkeye is saying that the ball is hitting the stumps, then there is no reason (that the appeal be turned down)
 ’ sachin tendulkar ke ricard paanchaven vishwa cap shatak kii madad se bharat ne 338 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha lekin iske baavjood team lagbhag match haar hi gai thi

 Virender Sehwag is not bowling and Yuvraj was current but i have always preferred the specialist bowler
 greem swaan or tim bracenain ne 49wein over main 15 ran batore or team ko jeet ke kaaphi kareeb pahunchaa diya tha
 Dhoni said that i am not disappointed, but not too keen
 meraa anubhav mishrit rahaa

 In the Brahmin-dominated Deoria Lok Sabha seat of Purvanchal, BJP replaced Kalraj Mishra, this time former state president Dr
 ramapati ram treepathi ko utaara he
 Ramapati Ram is the father of Sharad Tripathi, MP from Santakbir Nagar
 gathbandhan main yah seat basapa ke khate main gai, party ne yahaan se vinod jaiswal ko utaara to congress ne basapa ke baagi netaa niaj ahamed par bharosa jataayaa he
 At the same time, the contest has become interesting due to Ramashish Rai, former president of BJP Yuva Morcha, pushing an independent cadence
 gathbandhan pratyaashee ke congress roda bani hui he to bijepi kii raah main ramashish raay baadha bane hue hai
 In order to strike a balance in view of the Brahmin domination in Purvanchal, the BJP called Sharad's father and Dr
 Chanakya of the BJP organization in UP
 ramapati ram treepathi ke sahare devaria par apni baadshaahiyat kaayam rakhana chaahati he
 Sharad Tripathi is busy campaigning for him, but some people discuss with the tongue-in-cheek in the area that there is resentment of Sharad's 'shoeing' among the Rajputs
 haalanki bijepi ise vipaksh ke dwaara failaai ja rahi afvaah bataa rahi he
 Despite this, Ramapati is hoping to win with the help of Ram Brahmins and the bjp's traditional voters
 lekin bijepi ke liye nirdal chunaav lard rahe ramashish raay bada sirdard ban gaye hai
 Rai has been the national president of the BJYM and, having been denied a ticket, has jumped into the election summer without a party, which is showing the biggest problem for the BJP

 But the biggest problem in his path has become the Congress
 2014 main basapa se chunavi maidan main utarane vaale niaj ahamed is baar ke chunaav main congress se taal thok rahe hai
 Niaz Ahmed is believed to have a strong hold among the Muslim community in Deoria
 aise main niaj ahamed jitna muslim vot saadhane main kaamyaab honge, gathbandhan ke liye utani hi dikkaton ko saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 There are BJP mlas on 4 out of 5 assembly constituencies under Deoria Lok Sabha seat

 Azam Khan is the one who brought Jaya Prada into politics

 Jaya Prada was TDP leader till 2004

 Sixteen days ago, the body of a newly married woman was found from Shankargarh area

 In this case, three persons belonging to the family of a young man named Painter were arrested and the painter was declared absconding

 narendra modi desh kii arthvyavastha ko nai oonchai dene ke liye 'mek in india' kaa naaraa pradhanmantri banane ke baad se hi de rahe hai
 The same slogan was given in his ambitious Project Bullet Train, but from the reality that is coming, it seems that the government is far away from this slogan
 kai sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik japani steel or ejineering companiyon ke paas 17 arab dollar yani 1
 The Indian Bullet Train worth 1 lakh crores is a big deal
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki bhartiya companiyon ko isamen kuch khaas nahin mila
 The big contract, according to Japan, reported in HT, Japan is investing a lot of money in this project and 70 percent of the goods will be supplied by the Japanese company for the construction of railway lines for bullet trains
 haalanki is puure maamle main pradhanmantri karyaalay ne kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 In Japan, the Ministry of Transport of Japan is officially involved in the project for the training of railway officers for the bullet train, and it says that the two countries will work together with a fixed strategy for the supply of goods, in this case informed around July Will go
 haalanki is puure prakaran par aadhikarik rup se anbhigyata jaahir kii
 In September last year, a bullet train agreement was signed between India and Japan with 2 terms 'make in India' spread and 'exchange of technology'
 nai dilli ko ummid thi ki is project ke jariye desh main nirmaan uddhog badhegaa, saath hi nai naukariyaan paidaa hongi or japani takanic ko kareeb se jaanane kaa mauka milegaa
 Prime Minister Modi has to enter the general elections in 2019, and he is under pressure to create millions of new jobs to reduce unemployment in India
 bullate train kii ek eent bhi maharashtra main nahin lagane duungaa: raaj thakrenational hai speed rail corp limited (NHSRCL) ke managing diarector aachal khare ne royatres ko bataaya ki japani is maamle main behad sankuchit soch vaale hai kyonki wo samajhate hai ki japan main bharat kii tulana main kaam karne kii samskruti or system puri tarah alag he
 The ways of working in the two countries are different
 bharat kii dakshata par sawalkhare ne khulkar baat nahin bataai, lekin bhartiya railway ke adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki unke japani samakaksh kai baar bhartiya companiyon kii dakshata par sawaal uthaa chuke hai or unhen is par sanshay he ki wo samay kaa paalan karenge
 On the other hand, the World Bank report states that India is ranked 100th among 190 countries in terms of doing business
 duusari ore, japan ke parivahan mantralay kii railway beuro ke antarrashtriya ejineering maamalon ke nideshak tomoyuki naakaano bataate hai ki bhartiya companiyon ko vartmaan main hai-speed railway system kii takanic ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin he
 However, in the past, many Indian officials have accepted in the accounts that Indian companies are not going to get important responsibility in the bullet train project
 japan bullate train ke liye behad kam byaaj par bharat ko 50 saal ke liye baari karj de rahaa he
 Under Modi's 'make in India' flagship, it is planned that by 2022, India will reach an economy of 2 trillion dollars through manufacturing and 10 million new jobs can be created during this time
 japani pradhanmantri shinjo abe ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath pichley saal sitambar main bharat kii pehali bullate train kii neenv rakhi thi
 This train will run from Mumbai to Ahmedabad
 ahmedabad modi ke grihnagar gujarat kaa sabase bada vyavsaayik shahar he
 Fourteen years of military rule in 61 years
 ye pakistan kaa sabase khatarnaak sach he
 People have seen the demise bled here due to the stumbling of military butts, and once it is heard slowly
 1947 main bharat se alag hokar pakistan ban to gaya lekin gyaarah saal baad hi general mohammad ayub khan ne satta hathiyaa lee or do saal baad 1960 main khud ko pakistan kaa raashtrapati elaan kar diya
 Ayub Khan ruled Pakistan for a full nine years
 is dauraan bharat ke haathon pakistan kii karaari haar se ayub khan kii satta par pakad kamjor hone lagi or 1969 main general yahya khan ne unhen hukumat se bedakhal karke pakistan kii bagdor apane haathon main le lee, lekin usee yahya khan ke jamaane main purvi pakistan kaa bangladesh ke rup main janm hua or bharat ke haathon pakistan ko karaari shikast mili
 After this, the democracy of Pakistan once again came and elected Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to become Prime Minister, but the same General Ziaul Haq, who made him Army Chief, the same Zia ul Haq took over the reins of Pakistan in 1978 by overthrowing Bhutto himself
 saal bhar baad hi bhutto ko faansee par lataka diya gaya
 After that, till the death of Ziaul Haq in a plane crash in 1988, the military rule in Pakistan
 baad main chunaav to kai baar hue lekin pakistan hameshaa ladkadhaata hi rahaa
 The world once again saw military rule in Pakistan when Army Chief Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999 by ousting then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif

 People are of the opinion that the greatest benefit of prohibition has been socially

 Alcoholism is a better thing, it needs to be supported

 Complaints of husbands in the police are believed to be the effect of the impunity that today women here did not hesitate to complain to the police about their drunken husband
 siwan jile ke mahadev sahaayak thana kshetra ke bengali pakadi ilaake kii rahane vaali lado devi ne apane sharaabi pati kii shikaayat swayan police se kii
 According to the police, Vikas, the husband of Lado Devi, used to drink alcohol and fight with him throughout the night

 as u can see from this video i had fear written all over my face as i was doing this for the first time! My heart was racing and i was sweating like a pig! But in very less time i managed to figure out the technique and learnt the choreography only because i kept my determination despite the fear of dancing with fire and that too with such a heavy prop
 
 i have learnt a new skill now and im really proud of myself! Ive always been fascinated by fire dancing i just never had the courage to do it myself! But as an artist its always important to push yourself and find ways to work under pressure regardless of the circumstances! Never say i CANT always say i Will

 He advised Mukherjee not to hold such a meeting
 mukherjee ne is baat kaa khulaasa apni pustak ‘da colision ears’ main kii he
 He said that he met Thackeray on the advice of NCP leader Sharad Pawar
 rakanpa congressnith samprag ke duusare kaarykaal main sarkaar main shaamil thi
 When Bal had arrived to meet Thackeray, the former President said that he had gone to Mumbai on July 13, 2012 in connection with the election campaign
 shivasena ne bijepi nit rajg kaa ghatak hone ke baavjood mukherjee kii ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 After this he went to meet the founder of Shiv Sena
 mukherjee ne apni pustak main kaha, ‘maine sonia kii naamanzoori ke baavjood thakare se milane kaa faisla kiya kyonki mujhe laga ki jis vyakti ne meri ummidavaari kaa samarthan karne main apane paaramparik gathbandhan bhagidaar kaa saath chhod diya ho, use apamaanit mahasoos nahin hone dena chahie
 'pranab said that he had asked both Sonia and Pawar whether he should meet Thackeray on his Mumbai trip or not
 thakare dwaara mukherjee ko samarthan dene ke peeche pavaar kaa bhi kuch prabhaav tha
 Sonia had expressed his displeasure with the advice of Sonia and insisted that Mukherjee should meet Thackeray
 pavaar ne kaha ki agar mukherjee apni mumbai yatra main unase nahin milte hai to thakare use apane vyaktigat apmaan kii taur par lenge
 He wrote, 'sonia was not keen on meeting my Bal Thackeray and she told me to refrain from it when possible
 thakare ko lekar sonia gandhi kii aapattiyaan unki nitiyon ke bare main unki apni avadharana par aadhaarit thim
 Mukherjee said that Congress leader Girija Vyas met her on her return to Delhi and told her that Sonia and political secretary Ahmed Patel were not happy about her meeting with Thackeray
 sharad pavaar kii salaah kaa rakhaa dhyanaunhone likhaa, ‘main dilli laut aayaa or agali subah girija vyas ne mujhase mulaakaat kii
 He informed me that Sonia Gandhi and Ahmed Patel were upset about my meeting with Thackeray
 main unki aprasannataa kaa kaaran samajhataa hum, par jaisaa maine bataaya ki maine vahi kiya jise main sahi maanata tha
 i had to keep in mind the sensitivity of the advice given by Sharad Pawar, who was an important component of UPA II
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘apane sahyogiyon ke prabhavi hastkshep evam sahyog ke bina iske (samprag ke) liye apana kaarykaal puraa karnaa sambhav nahin ho paata
 It was already known that Sharad Pawar was already unhappy on various issues and there was tension in relations between other coalition partners as well
 main unhen aprasannataa kaa or kaaran nahin dena chahta tha
 "mukherjee Nelikha," he (pawar) jokingly said that it was only natural for the 'maratha Tiger' to support the 'royal Bengal Tiger'

 is par pavaar ne kaha, ' vastav main aisa tha?' bataa den ki sonia gandhi vaicharik rup se shivasena ke saath kisi bhi gathjod se saavdhaan thim

 com / 2kkz9xrkih loksabhaa chunaav saatven charan ke apane aakhri padaav par pahunch chukaa he
 This phase is also important for Uttar Pradesh because in this phase, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's stronghold Gorakhpur, as well as the credibility of veterans like Priyanka Gandhi is at stake
 saatven charan ke hone main matdaan ke lihaaj se is ilaake main vot or seat kaa sameekaran jaananaa behad dilachasp hoga
 Most of these seats are considered very important for the politics of the country
 saatven charan main kul 13 siton par matdaan hona he
 1
 varanasivaranasi uttar pradesh kii wo loksabhaa seat he, jiskaa bhavishya sunishchit mana ja rahaa he
 Here, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi has filed the form on behalf of the BJP
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ek baar phir is seat se pradhanmantri modi apni jeet darj karenge
 Initially, there was speculation that Priyanka Gandhi would challenge Modi in Varanasi, but the Congress has fielded former MLA Ajay Rai
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main raay tisare number par rahe
 More issue? Modi is the only issue in Varanasi
 2
 In Maharajganj, Maharajganj, Pankaj Chaudhary (BJP), Akhilesh Singh (SP) and Supriya Srinetra (congress) are the leading candidates and if we talk about Mahamukabale, then there is a direct fight between BJP and SP
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ke pankaj choudhary ne basapa ke kashinath shukla ko 2
 Was defeated by 4 lakh votes
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main loksabhaa kshetra main aane vaali ferenda, sisva or naitanava kii seat nirdaleey ne jiti thi
 The main issues of this time's election are not connected by rail route, pollution of rivers and plight of historical sites associated with Lord Buddha
 bhaajapa ke saamne apni jeet is baar bhi sunishchit kar paane kii chunauti he
 3
 devariyadevaria loksabhaa seat par mukhya muqabla rampati ram treepathi (bhaajapa), vinod jaiswal (basapa) or niaj ahamed (congress) ke bich he
 The combat on these seats is triangular
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main is seat se bhaajapa ke calraj mishra ne basapa ke niaj ahamed ko 2
 Was defeated by 6 lakh votes
 is loksabhaa kshetra main baitalpur chini mil kaa shuru na hona, kisaanon ko aawaara pashuon se hone vaali samasyaon kaa samaadhaan na hona or ghoshnaa hone ke baavjood krishi vishvavidhyalay kaa shuru na hona is baar chunaav ke pramukh mudde rahe hai
 4
 salempursalempur loksabhaa seat par mukhya muqabla rabindra kushvaha (bhaajapa), aar
 S
 is between Kushwaha and Rajesh Mishra (congress)
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main yahaan bhaajapa ke rabindra kushvaha ne basapa ke ravishankar singh ko 2
 Defeated by 3 lakh votes, and in the 2017 assembly elections, SP, Salem, Belthara Road and Sikanderpur assembly constituencies in this Lok Sabha constituency were won
 ucch shiksha ke yuvaaon kaa palaayan, sinchai kii samasya or salempur ko jila banane kii maang he is seat par janata ke bich ke pramukh mudde hai
 5
 mirzapuryaha mukhya muqabla anupriya patel (apana dal,) ram charit nishad (sapa) or lalitesh treepathi (congress) ke bich he
 In 2014, Anupriya Patel won bsp's Sumadra Bind 2
 1 lakh ke maton se haraaya tha
 At the same time, BJP and its ally, Apna Dal had won from five (mirzapur, Majhwa, Chunar, Marihan and Chambe) seats in this Lok Sabha constituency in the 2017 elections
 is kshetra ke pramukh mudde sukhi padi karnavati nadi, chunaar main paryaton kaa vikaas na hona or badahaal ucch shiksha he
 6
 gorakhpuryogi adityanath ne 2014 main sapa ke ram bhuaal nishad ko 3
 Defeated by a margin of 1 lakh votes and this time the contest is between Bhojpuri actor Ravi Kishan who joined BJP this year and Ram Bhuyal Nishad of SP
 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main is loksabhaa kshetra main aane vaale sabhi vidhansabha siton ko bhaajapa hi jeeta tha
 By the way, if we talk about the major issues of this area, then it is the problem of waste management, improvement in basic and secondary education and drinking water
 7
 Robertsganjpakudi Lal Kol (apna Dal), Bhai Lal Kol (SP) and Bhagwati Chaudhary (congress) are the prominent candidates from this Lok Sabha seat
 lekin sidhaa muqabla apana dal or sapa ke bich he
 Illegal mining, sluggish pace of Kanhar irrigation project, backwardness in health and education are the main issues this time
 8
 In Bansgaon, Bansgaon, the direct contest is between Kamlesh Paswan of BJP and Sadal Prasad of BSP
 jabaki chunaav ayog ne congress pratyaashee kaa namakan radd kar diya he
 In 2014, Kamlesh Paswan of BJP got Sadal Prasad of BSP 1
 8 lakh maton se haraaya tha
 BJP had won all the seats in this Lok Sabha constituency in the assembly elections also

 com / 55g1cjxple gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar congress kii yachika par supreme court sunwaayee ko taiyaar he
 The matter will be heard on Wednesday
 gujarat congress ke netaa vipaksh pareshabhai dhanani ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kar do siton ke liye jari chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ko chunauti di he
 They have demanded simultaneous elections on the seats vacated by Amit Shah and Smriti Irani
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ek hi din donon siton par alag-alag chunaav karana asanvaidhanik or samvidhan kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Two seats in the Rajya Sabha vacant from Gujarat will also go to polls on July 5
 daramil, chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana kii mutabik amit shah ko loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kaa praaanpatr 23 may ko hi mil gaya tha, jabaki smriti irani ko 24 may ko mila
 This made a difference of one day in both elections
 isi aadhaar par ayog ne rajya kii donon siton ko alag-alag mana he, lekin chunaav ek hi din honge
 With this happening, the BJP will now win both the seats
 kyonki, vahaan pratham variyata vot nae sire se tay honge
 But if elections were held simultaneously, the Congress would get a seat
 sankhya bal ke hisaab se gujarat main rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaar ko 61 vot chahie
 An election on the same ballot will allow a candidate to cast the same vote
 is sthiti main congress ek seat aasaani se nikaal leti kyonki uske paas 71 vidhayak hai
 But according to the Election Commission notification, mlas will vote separately
 aise main unhen do baar vot karne kaa mauka milegaa
 In this way, BJP mlas whose number is more than 100 can vote twice and win both candidates

 ise nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 The 2014 election is not a beauty contest
 aap 2003 kii baat yaad kariye
 BJP got a huge mandate in 3 states
 magar 2004 main vahi chunaav haar gai
 "nothing is permanent," said Nitin Gadkari in a fashionable manner
 badlaav hoga hi
 One cannot be forever
 raaj kapur ke meraa naam joker main ek acha gaanaa tha
 What is the world 
 
 'narendra modi kaa ubhaar?sawaal modi ke ubhaar ko lekar bhi kiya gaya
 On this, Gadkari said that the media forcibly makes hype
 punjab chunaav main manpreet badal ke liye hipabanaai
 Raised Kalyan Singh for UP elections karnataka main yediurppa kaa maahaul banaaya
 Where did it appear in the results? narendra modi development ke role model banakar yahaan tak ubhare hai
 This is the specialty of our party
 dilli biodeta lekar nahin aayaa tha main adhyaksh banane ke liye
 Is Modi setting the agenda for the country? On this Jairam Ramesh said that Modi is in the social media
 magar is desh main vyaktikendrit raajnneeti ab nahin chalane vaali
 Consideration will be needed
 is par gadakari ne chutki lee ki ye to congress kaa culture he
 Everything is going on around Sonia here
 magar acchhee baat he ki congress badlaav kii baat kar rahi he
 Gadkari said that the fight is not emptiness, but the idea is emptiness
 gadakari ne kaha ki vichaaron kii ladaai hona loktantr ke liye acha he
 He said that we have our own views
 ham un par kaayam hai
 But many times an attempt is made to create an image contrary to our views
 congress or sapa-argedy par hamalaa bolte hue gadakari ne kaha ki jo ek party yaa dharm kii raajnneeti karte hai, ve secular kaise ho sakate hai
 Politics of casteism? On this issue, Gadkari said that no matter how much we reject caste, BJP tries to dismiss those people as communal
 yadavon or muslimon ko lamaband karne vaale log secular ho jate hai
 He said that 'multicommunal Club' has been formed in the name of secularism in Delhi and we are called Communal
 is dauraan gadakari ne afjal guru kii faansee or bottla house encounter ke baad congress netaaon ke aacharan ko pakshpatpurna bataaya
 Jairam Ramesh hailed Gadkari's term 'multi community'
 unhone kaha ki main 'multi communal' kii paribhaasha soch rahaa hum kyonki koi multi communal hoga to wo to secular ho jayega
 On this, Gadkari started telling the lion in the middle that people put many faces on one face
 aam sahmati or vipaksh kii salaah kii baat?jairam ramesh bole ki mujhe ye kaboolne main aitraaj nahin ki gadakari ji kii report ke aadhaar par pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana bani 2002 main
 But politics cannot be done on every issue
 chunaav main virodh karo or phir baad main aam sahmati karne lago
 Ramesh surrounds BJP on GST issue
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ke aushavanth sinha iskaa prastaav laae the, magar ab vahi party isamen adnga laga rahi he
 When the issue of communal bill came, Ramesh said, it has also been talked about for 9 years
 unhone kaha ki is bill par alag alag vichaar hai
 But every state agrees on GST
 is par gadakari bole ki jab pranav mukherjee vitt mantri the, to satta paksh hamase dialog karte the
 For example, on the issue of Kingfisher, i said, save me
 mukherjee bole ki aapkaa dost he kya? to maine kaha bijepi ko 20-25 lakh kaa nuksaan hota he
 On the day of Kingfisher's flight cancellation, jet rates increase, then the issue is that if the intention of the government is correct, then advice should be given
 unhen bataaya jaae ki privet sector main mukaable kaa maahaul bana rahanaa kitna jaruri he
 Gadkari said that Congress has ended the atmosphere of the industry
 is par jairam ramesh bole ki is prakriya main media ko baahar rakhana chahie
 The real culprit is media
 ramesh ne bhoomi adhigrahan mudde kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki hamane bas itnaa khyaal rakhaa ki har meeting main media ko baahar rakho
 Work is done, in front of you
 is par gadakari bole ki agar desh hit main hoga to ham satta paksh kaa saath denge
 What kind of politics is Rahul Gandhi doing? Aaj Tak asked the question whether Rahul Gandhi wants to start a politics that the party's structure cannot handle
 kya dikkat kahaan he
 On this Jairam Ramesh said that i am not his spokesman, but have worked with him, then i can say something
 ramesh ne kaha ki 125 saal puraani congress main badlaav laana aasaan nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi wants that every section of the society should have a stake in politics
 kuch hi pariwaron kaa kabja na rahe
 Ramesh said that this may be the view of others
 magar rahul gandhi ne bataur netaa ise saamne rakhaa
 Gadkari said while making a comment about Ramesh, that is why we made a chaiwala a contender for the top post
 ramesh ne kaha ki raajnneeti main sahmati ban gai he sitting gating kii, jo kabiz he uskaa haq maan liya jaataa he
 Sitting should also be called get out sometime
 is suzav par gadakari ne hami bhari
 Ramesh said that Rahul Gandhi's thinking is not focused on 'I'
 'main hi hum' ke hisaab se vah nahin sochate
 On this, Punya Prasun Vajpayee intervened and said that where is 'I' more than Rahul
 bhaashan main main, meri maa, mere pita, main royaa jaise jumale rahete hai
 When i feel wrong, tore the bill
 is par ramesh bole ki yah sahi he ki vah isi kram se upar pahunche
 But now he is bringing change
 vah bhale hi mantri na bane hon, magar saarvajanik jivan main hai or kaam karke dikhaa rahe hai
 Ramesh also narrated an anecdote related to Rahul
 unhone bataaya upi main congress 24 saal se satta main nahin he
 We connected the banks by creating a lakh women's group there
 isamen rajya sarkaar se koi protsaahan nahin mila
 But Rahul Gandhi thought and did something in UP without it
 aap charchaa karte hai ki kya kiya
 Did it ramesh bole ki bina prashasan ke sahyog ke das lakh mahilaon ko ek lakh bachat samooh main ikattha karnaa kamaal kaam he
 How are you people connecting with the youth? Gadkari heard this question and attacked the Congress
 bole ye maa-bete kii party he
 Said that it is a matter of saying that the common man came
 to rahul gandhi khud se hi shuruyaat karen
 His only ability is that he is the son of Rajiv Gandhi
 gadakari bole ki hamaari party main kaaryakarta aakar mujhase poochhate hai ki unhen tikat kyon diya
 After listening to all i ask, can you ask this question by going to Sonia Gandhi in Congress? bheetar ghus sakate hai
 Gadkari said that it is only in the Congress that the Prime Minister should be born from the stomach of the Prime Minister
 is bayaan par bifere ramesh bole ki main tokaatoki nahin chahta, magar gadakari to aresas ke boote party adhyaksh bane
 Gadkari said that this is wrong
 main dilli nahin aana chahta tha
 There was no role of the Sangh in becoming the president
 gadakari ne kaha ki main poster chipakaata tha
 Could not do politics of losing or going to airport
 gadakari ne bataaya ki main kurta pajama nahin pahentaa
 Many people said that they will not be able to do politics
 vah galat sabit hue
 i was the youngest leader who sat in the chair on which Atal ji was sitting
 narendra modi ko dekhie
 Even today his mother lives in a small house
 gadakari ne tanj ksaa ki congress main ye mumkin nahin he
 Jairam Ramesh Thousand is smarter than Rahul Gandhi
 magar ye party ke mukhiya nahin ban sakate
 On this Ramesh laughingly said, you want to make me unemployed
 maahaul phir gambhir hua to ramesh ne kaha ki desh ke jaruri muddon par donon dalon ko saath aana hi hoga
 We have lost these opportunities many times in eight years
 is par gadakari bole ki raajnneeti main bahut kuch kaha suna jaataa he
 But we are working on India Vision 2020
 ham kai logon se mili, ye jaanane ke liye ki bhavishya kaa desh kaisaa ho
 i want those who are good ministers like Jairam Ramesh
 wo kabhi aaen or of da record hamase charchaa karen
 So it will be easy to implement them too
 magar dukh kii baat he ki main vipaksh kii party kaa teen saal adhyaksh rahaa, magar inhone ek baar bhi samvaad nahin kiya
 They discuss in Parliament before the bill comes
 gadakari ne kaha ki agar samvaad nahin hoga, to vivaad hoga hi or uskaa desh ko nuksaan hoga
 Gadkari said that Ramesh rightly said that the media does not even want unity
 magar ye aapkaa kaam he
 You do par ham bhi to samajhadaari dikhaaen
 Is there no scope for ministers like Jairam Ramesh in this system? On the question, Ramesh said that since the nineties it has been seen many times that institutions like courts have crossed the Laxman line
 sibiai or sivisi or sieji rekha paar kar rahe hai
 Today is our government, tomorrow it can happen
 ramesh bole ki ye sabhi ko dikkat degaa
 The courts decided that we would decide, order the governments
 teen si sibiai, sivisi or court ke chalate faisla lenaa khatarnaak ho gaya he
 Gadkari said that i agree with Ramesh
 maryaada paar nahin honi chahie
 Our cabinet and prime minister are supreme
 chaaron angon ko maryaada main kaam karnaa chahie
 The judiciary can interpret the law
 magar dilli main parking jaise masale par supreme court kaa faisla kahaan tak jaij he
 Who is reprimanding the whip of CBI? Gadkari said that the government itself has created this situation
 kabhi lalu, kabhi mulaayam ko fatkaar lagaai jaati he
 Ramsh said on this that even the Prime Minister is not left
 gadakari bole ki sabhi ko adhikaar kshetra main rahanaa chahie
 The last question came from the audience
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa sochate hi sonia or rahul gandhi kaa naam aata he, jabaki bijepi main vaajapeyi ji, adwani ji samet kai naam aate hai
 Why, so
 is par ramesh bole ki haa ye sach he ki do hi naam chhaae hai media main
 But there are leaders from many simple backgrounds in the party who are doing a very good job
 hastkshep karte hue gadakari bole ki inaki party kaa upaadhyaksh itnaa majboot he ki piem kaa bill faad detaa he
 It is Government Week, the family is strong
 gadakari ne kaha ki bijepi main loktantr he, isliye 7-8 ta hai
 Ramesh took a dig that all of you are subsidiaries, the holding party is the RSS sitting in Nagpur
 gadakari ke uksaave par ramesh bole ki maine kai baar rahul or sonia gandhi kaa virodh kiya
 Ramesh asked that if BJP says that there is no influence of the Sangh, then it is a departure from reality
 gadakari bole sangh hamaari raajnneeti kaa nahin jivan kaa hissaa he
 a poor family in the panchayat of Raghunathpur Madhuvan village of Maniyari police station in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, found it expensive to protest the molestation of their daughter
 bhari panchayat main dabangon ke saamne na keval peedita ke parivaar par mukadmaa uthaane kaa tughluqi farmaan jari kiya gaya balki unki jamkar pitayee bhi kii gai
 Actually, Chanda, daughter of Geeta Devi of Raghunathpur Madhuvan village, was molested by some Dabangs of the village
 in dabangon ne gita devi or uske parivaar kaa gaanv main rahanaa mushkil kar diya tha
 It was difficult for Geeta Devi's daughter Chanda to leave the house
 gaanv ke kuch dabang pravriti ke log baraabar chanda ke saath budtamiji orchhedchhadkiya karte the jisase yah parivaar pareshaan ho gaya tha
 Geeta Devi, exhausted, approached the Maniyari police station to get rid of this problem and complain about the handicap of the overbearing, but no police officers were ready to listen to Geeta's complaint there under the rule of law
 'bihar police, sadaiv aapke saath' kaa ek baar phir doosraa cheharaa saamne aayaa
 Distressed by the attitude of the police, Geeta Devi returned empty-handed with her daughter to the police station
 gita devi ne nahin mana panchayat kaa farmangita devi ne aakhirkaarmujaffarpur courtki sharan lee
 In court, Geeta Devi filed a libel letter against these overbearing villagers
 phir kya tha court main pariwaad patr daayar karnaa in dabangon ko nagavar laga
 After this, these bullies called a panchayat in the village itself and issued a decree to Geeta Devi and her daughter in the panchayat
 panchayat ne faisla sunaaya ki court main daayar mukadmaa waapas le lo
 Geeta Devi accepted the decision of the panchayat
 dabangon ko ye or bhi bura laga or phir jo hua wo kanoon ke raaj kii duhai dene waalon ke liye ek sabak tha
 These domineering women beat Geeta Devi and her daughter fiercely in front of the fiercely beaten panchayat
 berahami se pitayee kiye jane kii vajah se gita devi ke haath tut gaye or uskaa ilaaj sadar aspataal main chal rahaa he
 The matter was reported to senior police officers
 mujffarpur ke esaspi vivek kumaar ne maamle ko gambhirtha purvak lete hue puri ghatana kii jaanch karne kii jimmedaari mujffarpur ke dspi ko de di
 Also, after the completion of the investigation, instructions have been issued to take action against the accused
 punjab se shuru hui aam aadmi party kii mushkilen lagaataar badhati ja rahi hai
 Now, MLA from Delhi's Bijwasan, Colonel Devendra Sehrawat, has written serious letters to senior leaders of his own party by writing a letter to Aam Aadmi Party's national convenor Arvind Kejriwal
 netaaon par punjab main tikat dene ke liye yon shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 These leaders include Durgesh Pathak and Sanjay Singh, while Dilip Pandey has been accused of interfering in the functioning of Delhi mlas
 chitthee ke mutabikapriy arvind kejariwal ji,main aapkaa dhyaan in 4 muddon kii or laana chahta hum
 1-I have been told by some volunteers of the party about some cases of sexual abuse in Punjab during ticket distribution
 main punjab main kai logon se mila or in aaropon kii jamini hakeekat jaanane kii koshish kii
 i feel that you and the rest of the MLA in Delhi are unaware of what Sanjay Singh, Durgesh Pathak and the rest of the party's representative from Delhi are doing in Punjab
 2-dilip pandey bhi dilli main kuch aisa hi kar rahe hai
 Photos with their girls are being circulated on the Internet, on social sites and they are unnecessarily interfering in the areas of party mlas
 3-ab party kii chhavi or sthiti sabase saamne kharaab ho rahi he
 The time has come to take action against people of the wrong image of the party
 4-sandip kumaar sidi scandle maamle main jis tarah seashutoshne sabake saamne safai kii daleelein di he wo bhi hamaare mulyon ke khilaaf he
 i request you to do something that makes people realize that we can still bring change in politics
 bhavadeey,karnal devendra saharaavat, aam aadmi party vidhayak, bijwasansaharaavat ne ye chitthee anna hajaare ko bhi bheji he or aarope lagaaya he ki jis raajnneeti ko badalane kii baat kahkar arvind kejariwal ne party shuru kii thi ab us raste se party bhatak gai he
 So far no senior leadership of the party has given any explanation on the serious allegations made by their own MLA
 neshnal testing agency (NTA) dwaara desh bhar ke medical or dental collejon main daakhile ke liye yojit kii jane vaali pariksha NEET or desh pratishthit medical sanstha ames kii pariksha main varanasi ke akshat kowshik ne teesraa sthaan praapt kiya he
 NEET exam has a total of 720 marks, in which Akshat has got 700 marks
 padhane main medhaavi akshat kowshik isse pehle KVPY yani kishor vaigyanik protsaahan yojana main bhi apni kamyaabi ke jhande gaad chuke hai
 KVPY is a scholarship offered by the Government of India to encourage students in the field of science and research
 enditivi india ke saath apni baatcheet main akshay bataate hai ki NEET kii pariksha main sawaal to physics, chemistry or biology teenon se hi aate hai lekin safalataa hasil karne ke liye biology par sabase zyada dhyaan dene kii jarurat hoti he kyonki NEET main 50% sawaal isi vishay se puche jate hai
 Akshay says that if you score well in the biology of 360 points, then it increases the chances of success
 haalanki chemistry bhi akshat kaa pasandida sabaject rahaa he unka kahana he ki chemistry ke teenon hisse yani organic, physical or inorganic apane aap main ek alag vishay hai or inaki taiyaari ke liye chaatro ko alag alag approach kii jarurat hoti he
 In his opinion, NCERT should be the basis for preparing these three parts
 akshat kaa maananaa he ki medical kii pariksha kii taiyaari karne vaale chaatro ke liye physics hameshaa se hi ek mushkil chunauti rahaa he haalanki ye alag baat he ki akshat ne physics main 180 main 180 ank hasil kiye hai
 According to Akshat, sharing of time on subjects needs to be done very thoughtfully
 agar kisi ek vishay ke peeche hi adhik samay kharch kar diya jaae to aise main duusare vishay kamjor rah jate he
 It is usually that in the fear of physics students spend most of their time behind it
 jahaan tak pariksha ke tanaav kii baat he to akshay kaa maananaa he ki pariksha se thik ek yaa do din pehle kisi bhi kathin topic ko tach karne se bachanaa chahie isse bevajaah manovaigyanik dabaav se bachaa ja saktaa he or aap pariksha main tension pre hokar behatar pradarshan kar sakate hai
 The same preparation is also done for AIIMS, just in this it should be understood that all the questions in NEET should be attested but in AIIMS, there is a confidant who should not die

 On the question of low salary paid to the people of up-bihar, Thackeray said that this problem is also with the marathis

 sasuraal simer kaa serial main lead actor ke makkhi banane ke kisse ajtak koi bhi nahin bhula paaya he
 Actress Deepika Kakkar, who plays the role of Simar, was ridiculed on social media and now another TV character has been transformed into a chhipkali
 ji haa, serial divya drushti main laavanyaa ke kirdaar ko chhipakali main badal diya gaya he, jisase wo sho ke kirdaar rakshit ko daskar jaan se maar sake
 An actor has to do very strange roles in his career and if the demand of script and makers is such, then the actors also support him and try to give their best
 serial divya drushti kii actress maanasi shrivastav ne apane kirdaar ke chhipakali main badal jane ke bare main spotboy se baat karte hue bataaya, 'mere liye ye baat bahut phani rahaa
 i had heard about this from my co-star Aadvik and he was teasing me throughout the shoot
 hamen nareshan ke samay bataaya gaya ki mukta mam kisi ko bhi jaanavar main badal sakati hai to agar ye tumhaare saath ho to hairaan mat hona
 People have played the role of snake and mongoose before, so i was enjoying becoming a lizard
 ab meraa kirdaar puri tarah se negative ban chukaa he, jo alag baat he
 When Mansi was asked how she prepared for this character, she told, 'A lizard is quick to hide and quickly catches its prey, so i keep my character in mind properly i am trying to fulfill main nagin jaise serial dekhen hai to main ye seekhney kii koshish kar rahi hum ki actors apni ankhen kaise matakaate hai, unki body language kya hoti he or wo dialog kaise bolte hai

 In such a situation, when Mansi was asked if he felt bad about what people said on social media, he said, 'no, there is nothing like that

 When Deepika became a Kakkar or Simar fly, she was also trolled badly
 ye mekars kaa nirnay hota he or actors ko script ke mutabik kaam karnaa hi hota he
 If you dislike and troll my character, it means that you are watching my show, which is a good thing

 According to a news aired Wednesday on the website App
com, St
 Peters Preparatory School in New Jersey signed a deal with six-foot-seven-inch Veer, a resident of New York
 vir ke aane se team main ek tej-tarraar shooter kii kami puri ho gai
 The news says that Veer Kamal is a defender and shooter
 khabar main vir ke hawaale se kaha gaya he, 'iskaa matlab he ki mujhamen vishwaas jataana unke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit hua he
 Because if they do not do this then they will not be able to recover from the crisis
 'tippaniyan Veer's fellow players and his coach also praised him
 vir ke ek saathi khilaadi ne kaha, 'mere khyal main hamaari team main jis shooting kshamta kii kami thi vah uski bharpai karegaa or hamaare liye safalataa ke nae jhande gaadega
 i have seen him playing and i am sure he is doing wonders for the team
 ' The team's head coach Kevin Willard praised Veer for his passion for the game
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe khel ke prati uskaa ravaiya behad pasand he
 i like her strong height
 vah jab behad junun ke saath kheltaa he to use dekhnaa bahut acha lagata he
 We will get the benefit of the player who put the shot in the team in the same way that he puts the shot
 ' With the arrival of Veer, the shortage of a fast-paced shooter in the team was filled
 khabar main kaha gaya he ki vir kamaal ke dephender or shooter hai
 In the news, Veer has been quoted as saying, 'it means that expressing confidence in me has proved very beneficial for him
 kyonki agar ve aisa nahin karte to ve sankat se ubar nahin pate
 Comments vir ke saathi khilaadi or unke coach ne bhi unki jamkar saraahna kii
 a fellow player of Veer said, 'in my opinion, the shooting ability we lacked in our team will make up for it and will set new flags of success for us

 ' lagaataar teesri baar gujarat kaa 'sardaar' banakar narendra damodaradaas modi ne ek baar phir yah sabit kar diya ki vah sirf baton main hi nahin, vot hasil karne ke maamle main bhi apane pratidwandiyon se kahin aage hai
 Modi has joined the league of Chief Ministers like Jyoti Basu, Sheila Dixit and Tarun Gogai, who have held the reins of their respective states 3 or more times, winning the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Gujarat Assembly elections in about two-thirds of the seats
 modi kii is jeet ne gujarat se zyada bijepi or 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar kendriya satta ke raajnneetik sameekaran badal daale hai
 Before the election it was believed that Modi would need a big win to present his claim to the post of Prime Minister
 or agar aisa hota he to party ke andar bhi unhen party kaa cheharaa banane kii maange tej ho jaaengi
 The signs of which have already started coming
 aakhir kya hai narendra modi kii is jeet ke myne1
 Rutabagu will grow inside the party: Narendra Modi, who started his fourth innings as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, has already been strong in the party
 haalanki kai maukey aise bhi aae jab unke khilaaf aawaaj uthi
 But this victory has given a new dimension to his status
 yaa phir yun kahe party ke andar modi kii maang ko taal paanaa pehle kii tulana main or bhi zyada mushkil ho jayega

 Although the party will decide their prime ministerial candidate before the election, the stance is not clear yet

 The election of BJP President will have an impact, the tenure of the current president of BJP Nitin Gadkari will end by the end of December
 siyaasi uthapatak taalane ke maddenjar party ne nae adhyaksh ke chunaav ko maheene bhar ke liye taal diya he
 Nitin Gadkari will once again command the BJP, the situation has become even more complicated
 gyaat ho ki haal ke dinon main gadakari or modi ke sambandh pehle jitne madhur nahin rahe hai
 However, there are reports that many senior leaders of the party want to make Narendra Modi the president and contest elections under his leadership, so that there can be a spirited communication among the BJP workers

 Will Narendra Modi's image change? There are also reports that this time more minority voters have voted for Narendra Modi and BJP than in the last election
 narendra modi or unke samarthak in aankadon kaa istemaal modi kii chhavi sudhaarney main kar sakate hai
 However, it is difficult to say what will happen to the minorities living outside Gujarat

 He will now have to win all three bouts to remain in the medal race
 shuukravaar ko group bi main bharat kaa saamana purv champion germany ke saath hona he
 India is not out of the medal race yet, but a single defeat or draw in the forthcoming matches can knock it out of the race
 duusari ore, germany kii team do jeet ke saath behatar sthiti main dikh rahi he
 He has six digits in his account
 1968 ke mexico olympic ke baad se germany kii team bharat se nahin haari he
 However, his performance in this Olympics has not been as predictable
 usne belgium ko 2-1 se or korea ko 1-0 se haraaya he
 The German team is known for consistently doing well as the tournament progresses
 aise main bharat ko is team ke khilaaf behad saavdhaanee se khelnaa hoga kyonki ek bhi chook use nauven swarna padak kii daud se baahar kar degi
 The Indian team has undoubtedly lost their first match to the Netherlands (1-2) but during this time they have played an impressive game
 duusare match main haalanki newjiland ke khilaaf uski ek na chali
 India had won the right to play in the Olympics after eight years by defeating the weaker teams in New Delhi
 qualifing main uske pradarshan ke baad anapekshit dhang se usase apekshaayen bad gai thim
 Now India will not only have to win to remain in the medal race, but this victory should also be of a big margin
 germany ke khilaaf bharat ko jeet hasil karne main mushkil aa sakati he lekin isse kam kuch bhi uskaa kaam tamaam kar degaa
 In the match so far, many shortcomings of the Indian team have been revealed
 rakshapankti ke saath-saath forwardo main bhi gol karne kii kshamta kii kami dekhi gai he
 Excessive dependence on penalty corner specialists Sandeep Singh and Ramchandra Raghunath has also led to the loss for India as the player does not fully exploit the chances of scoring goals
 germany ke khilaaf bhartiya team ko ek lihaaj se agni pariksha se guzarana hoga
 While the German team has talented and experienced players, the Indian team will have to try to stop them

 Violence continues even after the Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal
 ab tak kai party kaaryakartaaon kii hatyaon par aag babula hui centre main sattadhari bijepi ne raashtrapati shashan lagu karne kii chetavanee di he
 Kailash Vijayvargiya, party general secretary and in-charge of West Bengal, made a big statement on Monday
 unhone do took kaha he ki agar bengal main aise hi halaat rahe to centre ko hastkshep karnaa pad saktaa he, isliye ham dhara 356 kii maang karte hai
 This statement by Kailash Vijayvargiya came during the Black Day organized throughout Bengal after the killing of activists in North 24 Parganas district
 is bich pashchim bengal ke rajyapal kesarinath treepathi ke pradhanmantri or grih mantri se milane ke liye dilli pahunchane ke baad se rajya main raashtrapati shashan kii atakalon kaa daur tej he
 The basis of imposition of President's rule: Constitutionalist Dr
 subhash kashyap kehete hai ki agar kisi rajya main kanoon-vyavastha puri tarah dhwast ho gai ho
 Confirming this, the Governor will send a report and if the President accepts the report, then President's rule can be imposed
 chunki samvidhan main kaha gaya he ki raashtrapati mantriparishad kii salaah par kaam karata he
 In such a situation, on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers, the President can use his powers under Section 356 to sack the government of a state
 dhyaan rahe ki kisi rajya main jab puri tarah shashan vyavastha fail hota dikhe, tab hi aise kadam uthaae jate hai
 The use of section 356 happened twice in the Modi rule
 The previous Modi government had sacked governments using section 356 twice
 march 2016 main uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagaakar congress kii harish ravat sarkaar barkhaast kar di gai thi
 Which the Uttarakhand High Court found it wrong
 maamla supreme court pahunchaa to yahaan bhi sarkaar kii haar hui
 Similarly, in Arunachal Pradesh, the Supreme Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 13 July 2016, dismissing the elected government
 is prakaar dekhen to bijepi ne do baar do rajyon main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya, magar donon baar court ne khaarij kar diya
 Which was considered a setback for BJP
 bijepi ko kya hoga phayda?raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki dhara 356 kaa istemaal dodhari talwaar he
 This can also benefit and harm the BJP
 agar laabh kii baat karen to is vakt pashchim bengal main bijepi kaa maahaul bana hua he
 It got 18 seats this time, compared to two in 2014
 vahiin bijepi sattadhari trinmul congress ke kheme main lagaataar sendhamari kar uske netaaon ko todane main lagi he
 In such a situation, it is believed that after the imposition of President's rule, the BJP can benefit if elections are held soon
 nahin to 2021 tak vidhansabha chunaav khinchne par bijepi ko nuksaan bhi uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Because during this time Mamata Banerjee can control damage in West Bengal
 yaa phir aane vaale samay main agar arthvyavastha kii haalat or kharaab hui to is par va aage kisi 'self gol' par centre sarkaar ghir sakati he
 Due to which the atmosphere created in favor of BJP may deteriorate further
 jisase bijepi samay purv chunaav kar bane-banaae maahaul ko bhunaane kii koshish main he
 Potential detriment to BJP Many political analysts believe that the use of Section 356 in West Bengal may cost the BJP
 vipaksh ek baar phir loktantr par chot kii baat kehete hue mudda banayega, vahiin mamata banerjee khud ko victim sabit kar janata kii sahanubhuti hasil kar sakati hai
 Like Uttarakhand or Arunachal Pradesh, if the court rejects the government's decision in the case of West Bengal, it will be a setback for the BJP
 raajnneetik vishleshak urmilesh kehete hai ki dalon ke bich aapasi matbhed or tanaav ke aadhaar par hi raashtrapati shashan ke faisle nahin liye jane chahie
 Before the use of section 356, a proper administrative and constitutional investigation is necessary
 desh main ab tak kai baar dhara 356 kaa sarkaron ne durupyog kiya he
 It is not known how much political parties were interested in this, but the states are definitely hurt
 urmilesh is baat se ittfa jaahir karte hai ki pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee sarkaar barkhaast hone par vipaksh ko bijepi ke khilaaf ek mudda milegaa

 unhone rashtravaadi vichaardhaara par ek puraa bauddhik diya jisamen unhone ne bataaya ki bijepi kis tarah se apni vichaardhaara ke prati samarpit he
 bjp's party president Amit Shah told the Congress in his intellectual that the Congress has no ideology of its own
 uske peeche sabase bada kaaran he ki aazaadee ke andolan ke liye chaahe koi samaajawaadee ho, leftist ho yaa phir rashtravaadi vichaardhaara ho, swantrata sangram ke senaniyon ke liye congress sirf aazaadee kii ladaai ladane kaa ek manch tha
 Therefore, even after many years of independence, Congress had no core ideology
 yahi kaaran tha ki vichaardhaara ke abhaav main congress ek parivaar kii party ban kar rah gai
 Bjp president further told the ideology and activists that it is true that the political party which does not have any ideology becomes obsessed with familism or it depends on a person's subject
 aaj ke raajnneetik paridrishy main iske kai udahaaran hai
 Shah also said that the BJP has never compromised with its ideology in the last 65 years, due to which thousands of people are joining the party day by day
 bijepi kii asli takat uski vichaardhaara or kaaryakarta he
 PMPM Modi and Amit Shah consider social media essential that social media has its own importance in today's digital era
 yahi kaaran he ki pichley teen maheenon main party adhyaksh amit shah kaa soshal media par blowers or activist ke saath ye teesri baar interection tha
 It is clear that the work is important, not social media
 PM Modi feels that social media has a very important role in today's era in making the image of the government and the party good or bad among the people
 piem modi ye bhul gaye he ki sarkaar or party kii acchhee chhavi uske kaamon se apane aap ban jaati he
 Social media is not required for that

 Raman was a construction worker

 The reports quoted Raman's friends as saying that he had been behaving strangely for over a week due to family problems
 vah vivaahit tha
 More than 20 personnel of the Singapore Civil Defense Force and Naval Diving Unit were searching for his body

 Raman worked at a construction site located about 500 meters from the reservoir

 During this time he sometimes shouted and sometimes he laughed, due to which he had to eat the judge's scolding
 praanrabhik str par may 2009 main sunwaayee shuru hui
 During the hearing Kasab used to salute the judge almost daily
 adaalat main jab koi gavaah uski pahchaan karata to vah muskaraata tha
 Kasab used to get restless during the hearing when a witness said that the Pakistani terrorist had carried out terrorist attacks at various places
 haalanki kasaab pratikriya main ek bhi shabd nahin bolta tha or sunwaayee prakriya ko bade dhyaan se sunata tha
 As the trial process progressed, Kasab's frustration grew and he began to express his frustration in court and jail
 kasaab apane cell main khaanaa phenk detaa tha tathaa biryani or matan kii maang karata tha
 He used to surprise people by requesting a story book and perfume
 vah aisi maange media yaa nyaayadhish em el tahiliyani kii upasthiti main karata tha taaki unka dhyaan aakrisht kiya ja sake
 That is why Tahiliani used to ask journalists to pay attention to the hearing instead of his demands

 He asked for permission to write a letter to Mecca but he did not say to whom to send the letter
 kasaab ne apane cell se baahar ghumne kii anumati maangi thi lekin adaalat ne ise khaarij kar diya
 According to media reports, the CCTV camera installed in Kasab's room showed that he used to eat newspapers too
 is bich kasaab ke vakil ke pi pavaar ne kaha ki unhen is baat kii koi jaankaree nahin he ki kasaab ne apni niraashaa pradarshit kii ho
 Pawar told that he used to get 10 to 15 minutes per day to talk to Kasab

 gauratlab he ki saansad ke gaanv ko god lene par vikaas ke liye alag se koi fund kii vyavastha nahin he
 Therefore agencies and other institutions are helping in the development but the villagers are not satisfied with their work

 In the village of Nagepur for adoption of the Prime Minister, when you go to take stock inside, then a plastic box will appear on the ground, which is actually a toilet
 yah dibba yahaan lagane ke liye aayaa tha par tej aandhi main tik nahin sakaa
 Many such toilets will be seen in the village, but many were standing and working but they also have their own shortcomings
 sabase badi samasya uske sokapit ko lekar he, jo seat ke neeche hi aath feet gadhde kaa bana he
 The toilet ground is also plastic which is suppressed by heavy weight and there is a hole in the sockpit below
 lihaaja log darate hai ki kahin tut gaya or gir gayi to jaan hi chali jaayegi
 It is more clearly the woman of the village Niasi states that "there is a problem in this, who has the power, if a man sits down, the strong wind will fall, then it will fall
" hamake eenta ke chaahi ek hi dijiye par thik dijiye
 
 
 ' plastic ke is shauchalay main khamiyaan to hai hi, ye isliye bhi inhen raas nahin aa rahaa he kyonki pehle ye gaanv lohia gram tha or usame eent ke pakke shauchalay bane hai
 Due to Lohia village, development took place here already, but Dalits were left deprived in it too
 piem ne jab gaanv ko god liya to aas jaagi par is baar inhen ambedkar kii murti or park to mila par abhi tak moolbhoot suvidha nahin mil pai, jisaki ye shikaayat karte nazar aate hai
 Ram Charan of Dalit Basti says, "there have been some such things here that toilets were built and other fraternities got them
 harijan birdari ko ek bhi nahin mila
 Some roads have been built, which means that it is lying in front, it did not become raw
 hamaare yahaan ek park bana
 The rest is a water problem
 bijepi ke log aate hai kehete hai par nahin hua
 The comments aisa nahin ki is gaanv main kuch nahin hua
 After the adoption of the PM, Nand houses were built for Anganwadi, bus stand, benches were made to sit and the biggest task was to install a 15 KW solar plant which is getting electricity in 25 houses
 lekin 25 sau aabaadi vaale is gaanv main rajbhar, patel dalit birdari zyaada he, jinka mukhya vyavsaay bunakari he
 Once upon a time, a new sari used to loom in 500 looms, but today in only 75 houses the loom is barely alive
 zyaadaatar karigar mazdooree kar guzar basar ko majaboor hai
 Therefore, his first demand from the Prime Minister is to resurrect his ancestral business

 In such a situation, this effort of the Prime Minister is commendable, but the manner in which the organizations are executing the work is not satisfactory
 is par pradhanmantri ko dhyaan dena chaiye tab kahin unka mansuba puraa ho paayegaa
 Anyway, in the village where the Prime Minister adopts, the expectations of the people increase
 jo kaam ho rahaa he wo inaki ummid se bhi neeche he
 In such a situation, people also have some resentment and are advising them to do one thing but do concrete
 ab dekhne vaali baat ye hai ki inaki ye salaah pradhanmantri ke salaahkaaron tak pahunchati he yaa nahin

 The biggest problem is with its sockpit, which is made of eight feet of pits under the seat
 shauchalay kii jameen bhi plastic kii he jo baari vajan se dabati he or neeche sokapit kaa gadhdha he
 So people are afraid that if they get broken and fall, they will die
 ise or spasht rup se gaanv kii mahila niyaasi bataati he ki " isamen yahi pareshaani he ki isame koun dam he, aadmi baithe to neeche gir jayega tej hawa chalegaa to ye gir jaayegaa
 Give only one wish of our brick, but give it right
 
 
 ' There are flaws in this plastic toilet, it does not like them because it was Lohia village before and there are brick paved toilets in it
 lohia gram hone kii vajah se yahaan vikaas pehle se hua par usame bhi dalit log vanchit rah gayi the
 When the PM adopted the village, this time he got Ambedkar's idol and park but still could not get the basic facility, which he seems to complain about
 dalit basti ke ram charan kehete hai " yahaan par kuch aise kaam hue hai ki shauchalay bana to anya biraadaari ko mila
 The Harijan fraternity did not get any
 kuch road bane he jo matlab he ki saamne padaa he kaccha, wo nahin bana ye dubaara ban gai
 We have a park here
 baaki pani kii samasya he
 People of BJP come and say but it did not happen
 tippaniyan It is not that nothing happened in this village
 piem ke god lene ke baad anganbari ke liye nand ghar bana, bas stand bana, baithne ke liye bench lageen or sabase bada kaam ek 15 kilowat kaa solar plant laga jisase 25 gharon main bijli mil rahi he
 But in this village with a population of 25 hundred, there is more Rajbhar, Patel Dalit fraternity, whose main occupation is weaving
 kabhi 500 gharon main karghe se nai nai sari shakl akhriyaar karti thi par aaj sirf 75 gharon main bamushkil kargha zindaa he
 Most of the artisans are forced to do Gujar Basar by doing wages
 lihaaja pradhanmantri se inaki pehali maang apane pushtaini dhandhe ko zindaa karne kii he
 In spite of these shortcomings, a good thing is that the mps of the country where they are not able to work in their adopted villages till now and many have not even adopted
 aise main pradhanmantri kaa ye prayaas saraahneey to he par jis tarah sansthaaen kaam ko anjaam de rahi he vah santosh janak nahin he
 The Prime Minister should focus on this, then his plan will be completed somewhere
 vaise bhi pradhanmantri jis gaanv ko god lete hai, vahaan logon kii ummiden bad jaati he
 The work that is being done is below their expectation
 aise main logon ko kuch naaraazgi bhi he or salaah bhi de rahe he ki ek kaam karen par thos karen
 The thing to see now is whether his advice reaches the Prime Minister's advisors or not

 Many times girls could not even understand even knowing everything
 partiyon main sirf ladakiyon kii entricya aap yakeen karenge ki ram rahim apane dere par aksar aisi mid-nite dance partiyon kaa aayojan karata tha, jinamein uske alaava kisi or mard ke maujuud rahane kii ijazat nahin thi
 It means to say that apart from Ram Rahim, only girls and girls could participate in these dance parties
 in partiyon main kabhi darshan dene ke naam par to kabhi prasad khilaane ke naam par wo apane hi bhakton se naa sirf lakhon rupee luutata tha, balki kai baar to inhen partiyon main wo tamaam hadon se aage nikal jaataa tha
 Special agents used to gather, believe the sadhus and sevadars who had served in girlsandre, in fact, the purpose of these parties was to elect the girls who remained from the black shadow of Baba for Ram Rahim's harem
 isi vajah se wo in dance partiyon main naa sirf ladakiyon ko hi daavat detaa tha, balki party main aanevaali ladakiyon main se kuch chuninda ladakiyon ko chhaant kar apni gufa tak laane ke liye wo sadhviyon ko unke peeche bhi laga detaa tha
 These sages were actually the special agents of Baba, whose job was to arrange girls for Baba
 ladakiyon ko fansaane ke liye soshal media kaa istemalaisse pehle ki ham baba ke is puure jaal-batte se pardaa hataaen, aaie sabase pehle aapako bataate hai ki baba ne ladakiyon ko apane jaal main fansane ke liye soshal media tak main kaise apane agent chhod rakhe the
 The Haryana Police has a chat with Facebook Messenger
 jisamen baba kii ek agent sadhvi or baba kii bhakt ladki ke bich baatcheet he, sadhvi dere main hone vaali dance party ke liye bhakt ladki ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 Sometimes this agent tells her the party law and sometimes how she can get a special bond for Baba for just Rs 12-15 thousand
 lekin is puure chat main sabase ahm or sabase chaunkaane vaala hissaa wo he, jisamen sadhvi ladki ko party main akeli aane ko kahati he
 The girl asks Baba's Sadhvi the question of whether or not to bring her husband with her, to which Sadhvi replies that only girls are allowed to come to this party
 chamatkaar ke naam par ladikayon ko fansaata tha babkeb sawaal ye uthta he ki akhir baba kii in mid nite dance partiyon main aisa kya hota tha ki unamem kisi mard ke aane kii manaahi thi? ab jab baba kii karatuuton kaa bhanda phuta he, in partiyon kaa asli raaj nikal kar baahar aa rahaa he
 If the rajdars who had left Baba believe, Ram Rahim used to call girls in such parties and try to subdue them
 wo inamen chamatkaar kaa naatak to karata hi tha
 His agents used to play his special role in it
 ek baar baba kaa chuaa hua ek keenu dere kii girls hostel kii ek warden ne puure aath lakh rupee main kharida tha
 Now think about what and how this purchase of warden would have affected the girls of the camp
 bas vahi se ladakiyon ko apane jaal main fansaakar wo unka istemaal karata tha

 It was speculated that Sapna Chaudhary might also get a chance to contest the elections, but the first list has given a shock to these discussions
 sapana ne kaha- puraa haryana unka haibtaa den ki sapana choudhary ne haal hi main ek news channel ko die intervyuu main chunaav ladane ke sawaal par apni raay rakhi he

 sapana ne kaha tha ki agar party kahegi to wo jarur chunaav ladengi
 However, Sapna has not been given a place in the first list, in such a situation Sapna Choudhary will definitely wait for the remaining 22 seats

 Some factions in the party say that Sonia has taken some steps to correct mistakes in the last one month, but some believe that she has failed to revive the party after the plight in the Lok Sabha elections
 party ke ek netaa ne kaha, "hamen abhi tak koi sudhaarwadi yojana nahin dikhi he
 No major decisions have been taken yet
 "unhone kaha ki party ke kendriya netritv main abhi 'ek vyakti, ek pad' par nirnay nahin liya gaya he

 The 9th match of IPL 12 between Kings XI Punjab and Mumbai Indians being played at IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali saw a scene which had earlier created controversy in the opening match of the same season

 us samay kings ilevan punjab ke ballebaaj keel rahul strike par maujuud the or non striker and par mayank agarwal khadey the
 Krunal Pandya turned towards the non-striker end before seeing Mayank Agarwal coming out of the crease before the fourth ball of this over

 Let me tell you that earlier in a match of the same season, Ravichandran Ashwin gave a run out against the Rajasthan Royals without throwing the ball to Jos Buttler at the non-striking end
 aswin ne butler ko ipel ke itihaas main pehali baar 'mankading' kaa shikaar banaaya
 At the time, Butler was playing 69 off 43 balls and Ashwin dismissed him from Mankading without warning, raising questions about his playing habits
 khel ke niyamon ke anusaar tisare ampire ne butler ko out diya, lekin aise wicket khelbhaavna ke vipareet maane jate hai
 This was followed by a heated debate between Butler and Ashwin
 match ke baad jab aswin se Mankading or khel bhaavana ko lekar uth rahe sawaal ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'meri ore se yah bahut sahaj tha
 It was not planned or anything like that
 yah khel ke niyamon ke bheetar he
 'not the first time that Jos Butler became a victim of Mankading
 2014 main vanade mukaable ke dauraan srilanka ke sachitra senanayake ne butler ko isi andaaj main ran out kiya tha, lekin chetavanee dene ke baad
 What is Mankading? If the batsman standing at the other end of the match comes out of the crease before the bowler leaves the ball from the hand, then it is called Mankading

 Syed Akbaruddin, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said in a joint statement at the intergovernmental dialogue meeting that a large number of UN member countries support the expansion of permanent and temporary membership to improve the Security Council
 akbaruddin ne kaha ki vito ke sawaal par kai logon ne alag-alag nazariye se gaur kiya, lekin ji-4 kaa rukh yah he ki vito koi samasya (nae sthaayee sadasyon ko tatkaal dene ke sandarbh main) nahin he, balki samasya avarodhon kaa praavdhaan karne ko lekar he

 ' unhone kaha ki yah durbhagyapurna he ki abhi tak unhen koi pragatisheel vichaar sunne ko nahin mila he or kuch desh puraane thukraae gaye vichaaron ko dobaaraa pesh kar rahe hai
 The statement said that they believe that there is an 'imbalance of influence' between permanent and non-permanent members in the Security Council and that extending the non-permanent category will not solve the problem

 Tejapratap Yadav, the elder son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, has threatened to quit politics, fed up with rumors and propaganda against him
 tejpratap ne ek lambii fasebuk post main likhaa he ki vah kisi dabaav main raajnneeti nahin karnaa chaahate or agar unki kahin koi sunwaayee nahin hoti he to vah raajnneeti chhod denge
 Hours after the post, Tej Pratap deleted this and said that his account was hacked by the BJP
 tejpratap ne kaha ki bijepi unke parivaar or party main foot daalana chaahati he or isi vajah se unke post ke saath chhedchhad kii gai
 Tej Pratap has started a campaign called Tea With Tejpratap in his area on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday itself
 isi dauraan unhen ilaake ke kaaryakartaaon se kuch logon ke khilaaf shikaayatein milin
 Tejapratap wrote in his Facebook post that some people are raising false rumors against him and are conspiring to defame him
 bihar ke purv swasthya mantri ke mutabik kuch log unhen pagal, sanakee or joru kaa gulam tak bataate hai
 In his post, Tej Pratap has also written the names of two people who are defaming him
 inamen emelsi subodh raay or om prakaash yadav kaa naam shaamil he
 Tejapratap has even described him as 'the snake of the sleeve'
 ilaake kii janata or kaaryakartaaon ke sambodhit karte hue likhi gai is post main tejpratap nejanata se apilki he ki vah in logon ko kshetra se baahar karen
 Tejapratap has written that he has gone to his mother Rabri Devi and father Lalu Yadav many times with his complaint but his mother is not ready to listen but instead scolds him
 pehle kii thi ye postakhir main tejpratap ne likhaa he ki agar aisa hi maahaul bana rahaa to vah raajnneeti se sanyas le lenge
 At the same time, those who are campaigning against them will do politics
 bataa den ki isse pehle bhi argedy main foot kii khabaren aam ho chuki hai
 There were also reports of a rift between Lalu's younger son Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap
 tab tejasvi ko arjuna or khud ko krishna bataate hue tejpratap ne kaha tha ki vah chaahate hai arjuna ko gaddi saunpkar khud dwarka chale jaaen
 However, the two brothers later denied the news of Khatas, calling it a conspiracy of the opposition
 chunaav ayog desh kii chunaav pranali se apradhi pravriti vaale ummidavaaron ko dur karne ke liye 'rhite tu riject' ke paksh main he
 An Election Commission official gave this information on Tuesday
 nirvachan ayukta ech
 s
 brahma ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog 'rhite tu riject' pahal kaa swaagat karata he lekin 'rhite tu ricol' kaa nahin, kyonki yah raajnneetik asthirataa paidaa karne ke saath hi vikaas kii gatividhiyon ko prabhavit karegaa
 He said that the Commission had proposed to the Government in December 2001 to include 'none of these' option in the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) so that voters could use it
 ek ghar main maa or beti ke bich muhabbat kii bisaat par shah-maat kii baaji saji thi
 In this love triangle there was a mother on one side, a daughter on the other side and a lover on the third side, whom both wanted
 or phir is lav story kaa ant itnaa khaufnak hua ki jisane bhi suna hairaan rah gaya
 Because in this game of checkmate, a mother killed her young daughter with her own hands for her love
 fasebuk par kareeb aae manju-vijayduniya ke lakhon logon kii tarah punjab kii ek housewif manju ne bhi bade shauk se apana ek fasebuk acount banaaya tha
 Soon the list of friends in this account began to grow
 lekin isi fehrist main ek naam aisa bhi tha, jisase manju kii dosti kuch alag thi
 He was a special friend
 naam tha vijay
 Who lived in Saudi Arabia, miles away from the border of India
 pehle baton hi baton main mulaakaat hui, or phir kab internet ke raste ne donon ek-duusare ke kareeb aa gaye, ye khud unhen bhi pataa nahin chalaa
 But here, the love of these two was rising and on the other hand, destiny was planning something else for this love story
 achaanak hui diksha kii mautadekhate hi dekhte aath maheene guzar gaye or ab manju kaa aashiq vijay hindustan lautanevaala tha
 Vijay was a resident of Rewari, Haryana
 lekin maheenon se fasebuk kii chating ke baad ab donon ek-duusare se milane ko bekaraar the
 Manju offered Vijay a visit to his home in Abohar and Vijay accepted this invitation
 manju ke pati kii pehle hi maut ho chuki thi
 And she lived alone in Abohar with her 17-year-old daughter Deeksha
 aise main donon ke rishton se kisi ko zyada aitraaj bhi nahin ho saktaa tha
 Now Manju and Vijay were living together for about five months
 lekin isi bich ek roj manju kii jawan beti diksha kii achaanak rahasyamayi tareeke se maut ho gai
 She was found hanging from the noose in her room and a suicide note was also found near her
 pehali najar main maamla suicide kaa hi tha
 Standing with a tattoo, but as the investigation progressed, the police caught sight of such a thing that she was shocked
 diksha kii laash kii baanh par ek aisa lafj likhaa hua dekha ki unka maathaa thanak gaya
 17-year-old Deeksha had written a victory over her arm with something sharp
 lekin vijay to diksha kii maa manju kaa aashiq tha
 Then the question was, why did Deeksha write the name of Vijay on his arm? Did Deeksha also love her mother's lover Vijay? Or was Deeksha's death really something else? The fake suicide note given to the police; In the suicide note given by Diksha's mother Manju to the police, the reason for her suicide was told not to get ancestral property
 or kaha gaya tha ki is maut ke liye uski dada-daadi, taaoo-tai or buaa jimmedaar he
 But even at the age of 17, the police felt strange about giving up life for the property
 or jab police ne diksha ke haath par gude vijay ke naam ko lekar tafteesh aage badhaai, to use is ladki kii maut kii jo kahani pataa chali, usne kuch der ke liye police waalon kaa bhi dimag ghuma diya
 Yes, Deeksha's death was not a suicide, but a murder
 or kaatil bhi koi or nahin balki wo thi khud uski maa manju
 Manju wanted to kill two birds with one stone Manju wanted to hunt two birds with one stone
 usne apane aashiq ke saath milakar apni beti kaa katl to kiya hi
 To avoid killing, giving the color of suicide to suicide, also wrote the names of all the in-laws in a false suicide note
 police is taraf tafteesh bhi kar rahi thi
 But then suddenly a name on the arm of the corpse gave the policemen a murder clue
 ab sawaal ye tha ki aakhir diksha ne aisa kyon kiya? or apni baanh par vijay likhane ke chand roj baad hi usne khudakushi kyon kar lee? ek uljhane vaali baat ye bhi thi ki agar diksha bhi vijay se hi pyaar karti thi, to usne khudakushi kyon kii? phir suicide note main usne pyaar muhabbat kii baat nahin likh kar jaaydaad kii kahani kyon likhi? ye tamaam suraag kuch or hi ishaara kar rahe the
 Now the police decided to interrogate Deeksha's mother Manju and her lover Vijay separately
 or donon se poochtacha ke baad jo kahani saamne ai, wo behad ajeeb or chaunkaanewaali thi
 Clash between mother and daughter over Vijay, Manju's daughter Deeksha also started loving her as soon as Vijay came to her house
 lekin jab manju ko ye baat pataa chalaa ki to wo diksha par agbabula ho gai
 Now Manju also wanted to marry Vijay and her daughter Deeksha too
 isi bich diksha ne apni maa manju or vijay ko aapattijanak haalat main dekh liya
 There was a fierce fight between mother and daughter about this
 or phir maa manju ne apane aashiq vijay ke saath milakar diksha kaa galaa ghont diya
 Then the corpse was hanged to give the case a suicide color
 or sasuralwaalon ko fansaane ke liye vijay se suicide note main unka naam likhva diya
 The truth came out of the post-mortem
 Since the death of Diksha, her mother Manju and Aashiq Vijay were constantly trying to confuse the police
 manju kii apane sasuralwaalon se rishte achche nahin the or diksha kii jaan lene ke baad wo ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaahati thi
 He first got a suicide note written by his own lover Vijay in the name of initiation and then got the names of several in-laws including his father-in-law
 
 Whereas he had nothing to do with this matter
 baad main postmortem report main bhi ye baat saaf hui ki diksha kii maut fande se latakane kii vajah se nahin balki galaa ghonte jane kii vajah se hui thi
